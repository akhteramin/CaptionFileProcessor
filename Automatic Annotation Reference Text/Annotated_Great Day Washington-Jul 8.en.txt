Good morning and welcome to Great Day Washington.
Plus were sharing how a group of local scientists are working hard to combat the pollution in the Potomac which is so important as we get that storm runoff this morning.
But first lets get over to WUSA9 meteorologist Howard Bernstein for an update on this flash flood warning were currently experiencing Howard?
Yeah Markette weve been tracking some very heavy rainfall over the last few hours.
These are flood warnings from Frederick in towards Southern Prince Georges County.
So much of the area under active flash flood warnings and these are the worst most dangerous type of flooding we can have because flash flooding happens very quickly.
It could catch you by surprise and it only takes a foot two feet of water to push your car off the road.
The good news is that up in Frederick at least the heaviest rains are done but even Howard County now under a flash flood warning til 1145.
Montgomery County on the East Side seeing some heavier rains but the heaviest rains and Mary and I were looking at this some of the precip intensities the rainfall intensities are in the five plus inches per hour in the heaviest parts so these are tropical downpours causing some flash flooding.
You see along I66 and South seems to be the heaviest.
Silver Spring youre starting to see not quite as heavy rain move in but everywhere you see orange and red very very heavy rainfall for Fedex Field right across the heart of D.C.Now moving down toward Alexandria here just about to Franconia.
So our friends down in Mount Vernon and Lowertown and areas of Prince Georges County outside the Beltway there.
Just generally South of Joint Base Andrews over toward Clinton and Melwood and Upper Marlboro get ready as this whole mass of water is moving down towards you with that flash flood warning until 1115 and Prince Georges County and we are gonna see better weather.
Once we get rid of this stuff this morning well see the activity shift off to the South and West as we get into the afternoon.
So the next one to two hours could be particularly bad with flooding but it will get better this afternoon Ellen.
I hope so cause the roads are not looking good right now.
This is a live look at the Beltway.
We had a closure here.
Theyve just opened a second left lane on the inner loop of the the Beltway by the American Legion Bridge.
Let me show you some of the backups because this has been going on for a while.
It sounds like there was a tree that fell onto a vehicle caused some sort of accident.
Theyre trying to move it over to the right hand side as quickly as possible but you can see from that camera thats what traffic looks like trying to head around the inner loop of the Beltway.
Weve had many rescues up in Frederick as well following Frederick County their police departments Twitter page.
These are just the main streets not even the side streets.
Definitely impacting you as you head out the door.

Developing this morning there was panic inside Union Station after loud bangs were mistaken for gunshots.
The incident happened shortly before five last night and many people took to social media to document the chaos.
One guys said he looked for exit signs and walked out the back of a store with some other customers.
Its crazy and we live in a society not only in America but all across the world when we hear unexpected sounds it draws our attention to what could possibly be and fortunately unfortunately its just the type of times that we live in.
It scares people because you never know especially after 911.
You really never know whats gonna happen.
Now the panic caused a stampede.
When it comes to the person who set off the fireworks police tell us they are investigating but would not say if someone was arrested.
However with all of those cameras inside and outside it is likely at this point they know how this was carried out and who is responsible.
Just last week fireworks sparked a stampede at Navy Pier in Chicago.
Police there say a private security officer mistook the sounds of gunfire as gunfire and shouted for everyone to take cover.
At least 13 people were taken to the hospital after being trampled.
The police department posted the pictures of 11 year old Josh Brown tying Officer Wilsons shoe at the 4th of July parade that was held in the city.

Josh says he hopes to be a police officer when he grows up.
