Announcer DBL starts right now.
Welcome to DBL.
Its Wednesday February 13th.
We are live and we are talking about what youre talking about.
Im here with Tory Jeff Al and Im Sam.
And if you havent noticed we have a very special guest cohost.
I know youve heard this a gazillion times by now but youre not only a friend youre my mentor and I really do owe sitting in this chair to you.
Theres a reason we worked with you.
Youre good.
That means so much to me.
Al Emergency fallout.
Well thank you for being here Dr.Drew.
We begin with an update to a story weve been tracking.
Jussies reps released a statement that says in part Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussies account of what happened that night consistent and credible.
This comes a day after a spokesperson for the Chicago Police Department said that the phone records that Jussie turned over Do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation as they were limited and heavily redacted.
Now Jussies reps contend that information was redacted to protect the privacy of personal contacts and other highprofile people who had nothing to do with the attack and tomorrow Jussie is sitting down with GMAs Robin Roberts in what looks to be a highly emotional interview.
Check out this teaser.
At any point during the attack did you fear for your life?
Dr.Drew I know on your radio show youve been following this case in and out.
What would you say to the narrative out there thats pushing that he may be making this up?
Its not our job to create a narrative its the Chicago PDs to figure out the facts and put that narrative together and then tell us what the deal is.
If he has overstated it for some reason Im also still worried about him and what happened that made him distort this thing.
So all of us sit back and just let this thing play out.
Its not our business!
Yeah I mean but you have to understand innocent until proven guilty is because we believe in America that we believe our victims at first.
And if its not true Dr.Drews right there might be something else wrong.
Were already this way and we havent seen anything.
I mean Tom Brady didnt give up his phone when it was Deflategate and yet were jumping on this guy.
I think anything that we get from this story will help push your narrative.
Theres money to be made from Division.
Yes unfortunately its the world we live in.
If this is proven to be a hoax now all the conspiracy theorists now go and you know what else was a hoax?
So its like everybody has unfortunately a financial interest in how this story turns out.
I guarantee you a lot of people commenting on this are not fans of his and dont care about his physical wellbeing.
They just see him or the kid at the National Museum with the Native American as just a way to furtherTheir agenda.
I just encourage people if there are holes in your story you think theres holes in his story which I dont watch the interview and make up your own opinion.
We will definitely be covering the interview tomorrow.
The media out there creates narrative.
Were having a conversation about it but you with those headlines that take a specific position one way or the other that is for the good of the network that is giving you the narrative and nothing else.
They wanna capture your eyes so they can make money.
