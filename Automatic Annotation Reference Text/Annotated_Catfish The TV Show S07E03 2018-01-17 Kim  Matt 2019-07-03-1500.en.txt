I cried my first time.
Wow.
I think were gonna try and get him on a plane tonight so that you can meet up wit him first thing in the morning.
All right.
Hes flying all the way out here so just make sure youre ready to talk to him.
She is a nervous nelly.
Okay so heres where we started.
So the first thing we found we searched his number bingo.
Look what we got.
Number for five years comes back to a Matt This never happens.
And he also has a Twitter.
Then theres some pictures back from 2012 that look like theyre of him.
This would have been the Matt that you sort of started talking to.
Then we looked up his URL.
A PlentyOfFish account thats up I dont know how or when it was last active.
For a guy who lives in Kissimmee.
Theres also this photo.
It could be him.
Im not sure if I should even make a comment.
Im not sure what to say.
Whats are you upset?
Do you mind if I take a second?
Sure.
Yeah.
Take as much time as you need.
Nev You all right?
Mmhmm.
Shes got like a little overwhelmed because I think she figured that this was gonna end up being like a huge embarrassing disaster.
