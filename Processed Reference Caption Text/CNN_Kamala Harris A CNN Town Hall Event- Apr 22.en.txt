Five of the top presidential candidates are sharing the same stage tonight for town halls with young adults.
And students who say that they plan to vote in their states' primaries and caucuses.
And they are right here in the audience with us.
We've already heard from Senators Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.
And next hour we're gonna hear from Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
But right now it's time to welcome to this very stage Senator Kamala Harris of California.
Hey guys, hi, hi.
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
Good to be, have a seat.
Thank you.
Wow they're happy to see you.
Hi, good to see you guys.
Now let's get to it because we want you to get as much out the next hour both of you.
That sounds great.
All of you as possible so let's start with what's dominating the news right now.
And You know that's the fallout from the Mueller report.
[Kamala] Yes.
We have a question from her name is Karla Alvarado, she's right there to the right.
And Karla is a senior at Harvard University from Massachusetts, Karla.
Good evening Senator Harris.
Thank you for joining us this evening.
In light of Mueller's report, do you believe the Democrats in Congress should reconsider their position on impeachment?
Well it depends on who you're talking to and what their position is.
But here's how I feel about it and thank you for the question Karla.
Look, for those of us who have been following the investigation and have seen any part of that report.
It is very clear that there is a lot of good evidence pointing to obstruction and obstruction of justice.
And I believe very strongly, first of all let me just be very clear about the table set.
I believe that we need to get rid of this president that's why I'm running for to become president of the United States.
So that is part of the premise obviously of my point.
But I think we have very good reason to believe that there is an investigation that has been conducted, which has produced evidence that tells us that this president and his administration engaged in obstruction of justice.
I believe congress should take the steps towards impeachment.
But I wanna say this because it doesn't end there, I also wanna say this.
I am also a realist and when I look at what has been happening over the two years and some months that I've been in the United States Senate.
I have also witnessed folks in the United States Congress and in particular in the GOP.
Who have been presented with many reasons to push back against this president and they have not.
And when we look at the impeachment process.
There will be what happens in the House, an investigation that takes place.
I think we can be pretty sure that it looks like that is very likely to happen.
And then it's gonna go over to the Senate and in the House there needs to be a vote by a majority, a simple majority.
And then it's gonna come over to the senate.
And I've not seen any evidence since I've been in the United States Senate.
That the United States Senate and the Republicans hold the majority.
I've not seen any evidence to suggest that they will weigh on the facts instead of on partisan adherence to being protective of this president.
And that's what concerns me and what will be the eventual outcome.
So we have to be realistic about what might be the end result.
But that doesn't mean the process should not take hold.
All right thank you Senator.
Let's talk about you cause a lot of the young folks.
A lot of the students here at the Harvard Institute of Politics.
They're concerned about how gun violence might affect them or family members, someone who's close to them.
On that topic is Ben Bernier, he's standing right there.
He's a student at the University of New Hampshire studying history, he is from Massachusetts, Ben.
Thank you, thank you Senator.
Hi Ben.
As a future educator I'm really bothered that public schools are being targets for mass shootings.
Two days ago was the 20th anniversary of the Columbine Massacre.
But still two decades later no major gun control legislation has been passed.
So my question is as president, how will you go about keeping our schools safe and keeping guns out of the hands of those who should not have them?
Thank you Ben and I'm sure that there are plenty of students here who while you were in high school, even middle school, that you had to participate in a drill, right.
Where you were convened and your teachers taught you about how you need to go run in a closet 'cause there maybe a mass shooter roaming the hallways at your school.
And in our America that should never have to happen.
Conversations take place-
every night.
Conversations take place every night between students and their parents.
Why do these things have to happen?
Why do we have to have a drill like that?
To which of course the response is because there are people in Washington DC supposed leaders.
Who have failed to have the courage to reject a false choice.
Which suggests you're either in favor of the Second Amendment or you wanna take everyone's guns away.
Supposed leaders in Washington DC who have failed to have the courage to recognize.
You know what you wanna go hunting that's fine.
But we need reasonable gun safety laws in this country starting with universal background checks and a renewal of the assault weapon ban.
But they have failed to have the courage to act so Ben here's my response to you.
Upon being elected I will give the United States Congress 100 days to get their act together and have the courage to pass reasonable gun safety laws.
And if they fail to do it, then I will take executive action and specifically what I will do is put in place a requirement that for anyone who sells more than five guns a year they are required to do background checks when they sell those guns.
I will require that for any gun dealer that breaks the law the ATF take their license.
And by the way ATF, Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms.
Well the ATF has being a lot of the A and the T but not much of the F and we need to fix that.
And then-
On the third piece cause none of us have been sleeping over the last two years.
Part of what has happened under the current administration is they took fugitives off the list of prohibited people.
I'd put them back on the list meaning that fugitives from justice should not be able to purchase a handgun, or any kind of weapon.
So that's what I'd do.
[Don] Will this be your first executive action as president?
Well it depends on what else happens that'd be after 100 days.
Let's see what happens in the first 100 days.
All right, fair enough.
Angela Garrazzo is here and she is a freshman at Saint Anselm College studying International Relations.
She is from New Hampshire, Angela.
Good evening Senator my question is as a college student with over $25,000 of debt in my first year alone.
What will you do to alleviate the financial burdens of the student debt crisis?
Do you support initiatives such as free college, loan protective legislation or student repayment plans?
Yeah Angela, and listen, the students in New Hampshire are among the top five in the country with student loan debt.
And it is absolutely unconscionable that we have students in America who are in absolute fear, about the debt that they will owe upon graduation.
And I have met and know so many students who are making decisions about their career based on their fear that they may not be able to pay their bills.
I know so many students who have graduated who are making decisions about whether or not to have a family.
Based on the burden of their student loan debt and being concerned about whether they're gonna actually be able to get through the month.
We cannot afford to have a system like this especially for young people who have made an investment of their time and their resources.
Because they actually want an education to live a productive life and contribute to our society and be leaders.
So here's what I'd do specifically I do support debt-free college.
I also believe that what we need to do is we need to allow students to refinance your student loan debt.
And in particular I am supporting an initiative that would allow you to refinance your student loan debt such that it would be on par with the federal lending amounts.
So for example if you, probably none of you here, but any of your older brothers and sisters.
If you took out student loans between the years of about 2006 through 2013 the interest rate was about 7%.
What I am proposing is regardless of the interest rate at the time that you took out your student loans, that upon repayment it would have to be at 3.5%.
The other thing is this, part of the issue is in terms of repayment.
There is no connection between what you owe and your income.
So what I would be requiring is that there would be a robust process by which income-based repayment would be the norm.
And finally, let's look at the fact that for all of you and all of anybody who has applied for financial aid.
That is an awful process.
You guys know what I'm talking about
all those pages
you can barely get through that form.
And so part of what we need to do is simplify that process.
But we have got to do a better job in this country because I look at something like for example teachers.
I've been spending a lot of time.
I think a lot about education in terms of every aspect of it from student loans, to what we need to do to pay our teachers their value.
And the number of teachers who have left the profession of teaching, 'cause they can't afford to pay off their student loans.
Right now we're looking at actually a deficit of teachers based on the number of students that we need to actually teach and the few teachers we have especially rural areas.
So it's a big issue and it crosses a lot of subjects.
Well let me jump in here because if students, I mean teachers can pay their loans.
Elizabeth Warren is here as you know.
She said that she supports student loan forgiveness for 42 million Americans.
Yeah.
Would you go that far, do you support that?
Well I support anything that is about reducing the debt of student loans and I think that's an important conversation to have.
Okay fair enough.
Let's move on now, Ryan Wilson is here, Ryan is a sophomore at Harvard studying Neuroscience in California and a supporter of Julian Castro, Ryan.
Hi, good evening Senator Harris.
My name is Ryan and I'm a constituent of yours from Orange country California.
In a January town hall, when asked about your approach to universal health care, you acknowledged that you'd support eliminating private insurers in favor of a single payer health insurance program.
How do you respond to the 74% of Americans who wish to have the option to keep their private insurers?
Well I support Medicare for all and I support it for a number of reasons.
That include the fact that there are a lot of people in our country who simply do not have access to healthcare 'cause they cannot afford it.
And that's unconscionable and I actually believe it's a moral issue.
And it is a sign of weather or not we are gonna be a civil society to determine are people gonna have access to healthcare simply because they can afford it.
When in fact that should be a right and not a privilege of the few who can afford it.
That is the value with which I bring to this discussion.
I will also say this on the issue of this whole dynamic about access to private insurance. Yeah of course private insurance you can get supplemental insurance and all that.
But let's not be duped by a messaging campaign that has been waged for years by the insurance companies.
To have you into believing that you need to defend them, you need to defend yourself.
You know what 91% of the doctors are in Medicare.
So the idea and the suggestion they're trying to make to you is really a false one.
You will be able to have your doctor.
91% of them are in the Medicare system.
And I'll tell you another thing and it's a personal story.
My mother who, my mother was all of five feet tall, if you ever met her you would thought she was seven feet tall.
She was an incredible woman. She had two goals in her life.
She was a breast cancer researcher. Her goal was to end breast cancer and raise her two daughters.
Well she got cancer and she ultimately passed away from cancer.
But if you have ever had the unfortunate experience of going through the healthcare system with someone who has an acute illness.
I'm gonna tell you what that is.
It is having a doctor say to you have you heard of the term anticipatory grief.
Which you hadn't heard before but when you hear it it makes perfect sense.
Which means you're starting already to grieve the loss of someone that is still around.
You have the experience of going in and out of hospitals helping someone who is frail and weak in and out of cars to get into a hospital.
You look at medical charts and sometimes the medicine jives sometimes it doesn't.
Sometimes people are paying attention to this is the medication that causes drowsiness.
They don't want, or pain that they can't bear.
You go through the process of worrying about is there something I can cook that will make you be able to eat and hold down.
You go through the process of being concerned that somebody who is on chemotherapy are there clothes. Can I get you something that's soft enough that you can wear that will not irritate your skin.
Now thankfully our mother had Medicare, but for people who are going through this process, which they are every day in America.
For them to also have to be concerned about how they're going to pay that bill is unconscionable.
And that's how I feel about this subject.
Cost should not be the barrier to receiving the care that will relieve you of pain or help improve your quality of life.
And we've got to get this right that's how I feel.
So you mentioned the insurance companies you don't feel like you have to defend the insurance companies?
No I don't have to.
So the bill that you co-sponsored it would effectively eliminate private insurance.
Is there room for private insurance in a?
No, of course there is, for supplemental insurance absolutely.
For companies, for private insurance companies, there's room in your administration for that.
Yeah.
Okay, but listen in this bill.
But Don I think that it's really important to talk about the goal.
Right, I mean we can talk about the intermediate steps.
But the goal has to be and we all have to agree access to healthcare is a right and should be thought of as a right and pubic policy should create it.
Such that it is a real right and not a privilege for those who can afford it.
And it's one of the biggest issues impacting American families right now.
I'm traveling this country it's one of the biggest issues.
The number of people who sit down and make decisions about whether they're gonna have access to healthcare or not based on money, you would shocked.
One out of four diabetes patients in our country cannot afford their insulin.
There is a drug that helps save a life if there have been an overdose of opioids.
And that drug can cost up $4,000, that's unconscionable.
Listen but to be clear this bill that you co-sponsored essentially phases out private insurance for four years, in four years.
I don't think that's right.
That's what the studies show that it would phase out private insurance.
Which bill, I'm actually supporting?
The bill that you co-sponsored.
Medicare for all?
Yes, would co-sponsored with Bernie Sanders, Medicare for all would effectively eliminate private insurance.
It would essentially phase out private insurance companies.
As the main source but there would still be supplemental.
There'd still be access to supplemental insurance
Okay, all right.
For whatever is not covered but let's be clear about it.
Medicare for all under the plan that I am supporting will extend coverage.
So whereas right now it does not cover dental, vision, hearing aids.
Under the plan, Medicare for all it will cover those needs will be covered, there will an extension of it.
Including mental health services, including what we need to do better around women having greater access to reproductive health care.
All right, now the Green New Deal.
Yes.
The Green New Deal, everyone wants to hear, wants to know about that.
Max Ratner is originally from Massachusetts.
He is now a student at Saint Anselm College right here.
Last summer he interned for Senator Ed Markey.
Max what's your question?
Senator Harris thank you for taking my question.
Thank you Max.
The Green New Deal is not a law but rather a memorandum that has no actual legislative effect.
It's been characterized as expensive, divides democrats and has no chance of passing through congress in it's current state.
Why do you support it?
I support it because I to my core know that the climate crisis is representing an existential threat to who we are as human beings.
We have had supposed leaders who are buying science and pushing science fiction instead of science fact.
And this is to our collective peril if we don't take this matter seriously with a sense of urgency.
Why I support the Green New Deal is because it does that.
It puts timelines in effect, it appreciates that we need to take this seriously and the clock is ticking every day on this issue.And every day we fail to act, will be to our collective consequence.
The UN has already said over the next 12 years if we don't get this straight there will be severe consequence.
And this is within our ability to do something about it.
Listen, families are impacted by this.
You know children, seniors we all need to drink clean air, drink clean water and breathe clean air.
And you know don't drink the air.
You look at farmers, farmers are impacted by this climate change.
You can look at fire fighters in California who are impacted by climate change.
Across the board people are being impacted by this.
Let's also look at the fact that we have in so many states great work that is happening.
That is actually contributing to the economy around an investment in renewable energies.
The bureau of labor statistics came out with a list last year of the top 20 jobs that are gonna see the greatest amount of growth in our country over the next 10 years.
Number one and number two, installation and maintenance of wind turbines and solar paneling.
Let's look at it in the context of what we know to be true about water.
Water is a precious and diminishing resource on our planet.
When you look at what's happening around shifting populations around the globe, climate change is one of the main factors in what is happening.
There was a time and still to this day where we're fighting wars over oil.
In a short matter of time guys, we're gonna be fighting wars over water.
Part of what we can do with the Green New Deal is have a sense of urgency on all these matters.
Including the precious nature of water and what we need to do to be smarter on public policy.
I think that for example that we need to have really diversify public policy on water.
With an equal emphasis on recycling, on conservation, on capture of water, storage of water, desalination.
We need to invest in electric cars.
We need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
All of that is in the Green New Deal.
And you know the greatest thing about it that I'm really enjoying.
It it causing these conversations to happen around our country in a way they've not been in the last few years.
And hopefully everyone is understanding that so much of the harm we are doing to our planet is caused by us as human beings.
And the solutions will be because we change our behaviors without much requirement of change to lifestyle.
And it will be urgent in terms of the work we need to do and the approach we need to have, but we can see success.
We've seen it in California.
In California we made a decision that we would go back to the 1990s standards in terms of emissions by the year 2020 and we've already met those goals.
This can happen, we can do it but there has to be leadership in our country and that is one of the main reasons we need a new president of the United States.
All right, so speaking of air and water why don't we take a a breather.
Okay.
And get a sip of water, we're gonna be right back with more of CNNs special Democratic presidential town hall event.
Make sure you stay with us.
