Yeah yeah.
Theyre going to be performing for us throughout the show thank you.
Kelly please.
Look at this.
Lets talk about the Fourth of July Kelly.
Ryan I was hoping you would bring it up.
The most important part of the Fourth obviously is not necessarily the history but posting photographs of your celebration on this day right?
Correct.
So many great opportunities.
Correct.
NowSophia you are so cute.
Sorry go ahead.
These are the best captions for Fourth of July for your pictures.
So youre welcome.
Put these to good use later.
Drinkin DrinkinLikeLincoln.
Now Im not making these up.
These are actually online.
Um...Red White and Brew.
RedWhiteAndBrew.
The Star Spangled Hammered.
Sippin On LiberTea.
Yeah I like that.
Well thats...
If you want.
Mhm.
You know what?
Tell me Kel.
Its funny Is it?
Were talking about where can we keep this gigantic flamingo?
Because we can all agree this is probably the greatest pool float in the universe.
Audience Member Oh yeah!
I think so.
Seaworthy.
This is like the yacht of sea of pool floats Would you not say?
This is it.
This is what you stammers strive for.
You guys are rock stars.
You have this all day long.
This is like in your tub.
But would you like to see the worlds largest pool?
Its at a resort in Chile.
Ryan Look at that oh my God.
Kelly Its the San Alfonso Del Mar.
Worlds largest manmade lagoon.
Its the exact same crystalclear turquoise hue of the sea.
Sea Water.
So they made the pool look just like the sea and they filled it with sea water.
I mean why not just go in the sea right?
I mean am I right?
Well listen Kelly Am I just...
But listenAm I just being a killjoy?
Ryan A lot of people are afraid of I dont know.
What they have in the sea.
They could have jellyfish.
They could have other animals creatures...Well listen somebody goes over there This is safe.
Grabs something over there and pulls a prank and throws it in the pool.
Its gonna live because its sea water.
Its gonna live cause its sea water.
Right?
Honey Ill be right back.
Im going to do some laps.
Yeah.
How long do you think that would take days?
I guess.
I mean theyve got sailboats in there.
But we could definitely get a whole flock of these flamingos.
Yeah.
We could jet ski in there.
Yeah.
If thats legal.
I see all kinds of things in there.
Sometimes by the way you know there are some people who are afraid to swim in the ocean and so thats a good alternative.
On the Fourth of July we should tell you I mean you know this obviously from history.
United States observes a federal holiday in honor of the Declaration of Independence.
Commemorates the adoption of the Declaration of Independence July 4th 1776.
By delegates from the 13 colonies.
Now now the important stuff.
If the Fourth of July falls on a Sunday we observe the holiday on the following Monday.
If it falls on a Saturday we observe it on a Friday.
If it falls on a ThursdayIf it falls on a Tuesday we take the whole rest of the week off.
Exactly.
If it falls in between...Hey did you hear about this?
No but Im about to.
Do you guys know how manyLets see I see a lot of young people here today.
Millennials and Gen Zers Hey guys.
Where are you?
Yes.
Lots.
My people.
Your people are here.
My people.
Your people are representing.
Thats right I see you.
So the flamingo pose is the latest Instagram friendly stance.
Do you know about the flamingo pose everybody?
Oh.
Heres I believe is that Kendall Jenner?
Yep Kendall Jenner is...Well are they calling it the flamingo pose because shes wearing that dress?
Or because her legs the one leg?
Well the dress helps.
Gelman we are you know we are in our thong shorts Yes.
So maybe you can do the flamingo for us?
Maybe.
Somehow that looks different.
That doesnt look like...Ryan That was tree from yoga.
laughs Well thats all IYeah.
You stand on one leg and you get bonus points if you can slightly cross your knees.
Which helps to create a slimming effect for your legs.
Ryan Lets see your bonus points.
Gelman youve gotWhat about my knee?
Well I wouldnt wantCome on.
What do you want from me?
Youre actuallyHe actually looksAlright.
The other thing thats a trend this summer...stammers This is not good for your skin.
Cant highly recommend it.
But theyre saying sunburn tattoos.
You know when you fall asleep in the sun you leave your hand like this?
Yes.
Anybody?
Yeah.
So sunburn tattoos are big for the Summer of 2019.
People are placing stencils on exposed skin.
Soaking up the sun.
And then theyve got you know the Batman logo or other different things Oh geeze.
That look like a tattoo.
Kelly Oh that seems dangerous though.
Its well thats notI mean and you know its not heres the thing kids and Im going to tell you this...Oh gosh.
Heres what Im going to tell you because nobody told us in my day this.
Because there was still like a lot of conflicting data about sunscreen Mmm mhm.
At least in our household.
Right.
Its not the sunburn that day right?
Its what the sunburn turns into 30 years from now.
Ah.
Right moms?
Yeah.
So put it on early soAnd I know that it is in your instinct Sophia to tune out the moms.
Do you understand?
I get it.
We get it.
Its everybodys instinct to tune out the moms To tune out the moms.
Right.
But we actually stammers we actually when it comes to this thing know exactly what were talking about.
You carry wisdom with this.
Yes you dont need you dont need a Batman shaped melanoma 30 years from now.
One other quick public service for the barbecuers today for July 4th.
Yes?
If you are someone thatWhen Im out and Im with other people usually they get the mosquito bites.
Am I crowding you?
I just noticed you leaned away from me.
I feel like...
I feel like I just brushed my teeth.
So I dont think its aNo no no.
You smell like a lozenge.
I do.
Well thats because I ate the lozenge.
No but youre not crowding me at all.
Right.
I just wanted to make eye contact.
Oh okay.
So your vision is going?
My visions bad.
Kelly?
Kay.
Kelly?
Youre the first millennial Ive ever seen do that.
Can I borrow my millennial glasses to read this?
Sure go for it.
Oh look at this!
No its a public service.
So usually Im not the one gets eaten by mosquitoes.
Its the person Im with.
Which is a great going out benefit but...Oh my gosh.
If youre the one that always gets the mosquito bites researches say music by Skrillex will prevent the mosquitoes from biting you.
Researchers examined the effects of electronic music on mosquitoes and it made em less likely to bite.

Its not insulin.
Man I take it once a week.
It starts acting in my body from the first dose.
Narrator Trulicity isnt for people with type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis.

Do you toss or turn all night or wake up with a sore neck or a headache?
Then its time you discovered MyPillow.
Hello Im Mike Lindell inventor of MyPillow.
Just like you I had problems sleeping.
I tried every pillow out there and nothing worked.
15 years ago I invented MyPillow.
It took me two years to develop because I wanted to have everything you would ever want in a pillow.
I made sure that you could adjust my patented fill so you could have the exact support you need as an individual.
Regardless of your sleep position.
I also wanted a pillow that would last.
So I made MyPillow machine washable and dryable.
I back MyPillow with a 10 year warranty and a 60 day moneyback guarantee.
Not only that I do all my own manufacturing in my home state of Minnesota.
Take advantage of my 2pack special.
Use the promo code and get two MyPillows for 69.98.
Thats only 34.99 a pillow.
Call or go online now.
Narrator Other pillows go flat.
Causing you to fold them over or use your arm for support.
Which can cause pain.
Hard foam pillows can raise your head too high and heat up during the night.
Making you very uncomfortable.
But the revolutionary MyPillow has patented fill that wont go flat and helps keep your neck supported and aligned to your exact individual need.
MyPillow helps you get and stay in deep sleep all night long.
Before MyPillow sleeping was a nightmare.
First night I got it slept like a baby.
Just was out completely out.
I sleep better.
I wake up I feel refreshed I feel healthy.
MyPillow helps me get a good nights sleep so I can do my job in the morning.
I personally guarantee that MyPillow will be the most comfortable pillow youll ever own.
