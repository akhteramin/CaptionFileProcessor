Good morning and welcome to Great Day Washington.
I'm Markette Sheppard.
Kristen is out today but if you're at home and you're looking for a mate, we've got some great digital dating tips for you this morning.
Plus we're sharing how a group of local scientists are working hard to combat the pollution in the Potomac which is so important as we get that storm runoff this morning.
But first, let's get over to WUSA9 meteorologist, Howard Bernstein, for an update on this flash flood warning we're currently experiencing, Howard?
Yeah, Markette, we've been tracking some very heavy rainfall over the last few hours.
It came out of Frederick then moved right down to 70.
These are flood warnings from Frederick in towards Southern Prince George's County.
So much of the area under active flash flood warnings and these are the worst, most dangerous type of flooding we can have, because flash flooding happens very quickly.
It could catch you by surprise and it only takes a foot, two feet of water, to push your car off the road.
So that's why you hear turn around, don't drown.
The good news is that up in Frederick at least, the heaviest rains are done, but even Howard County now under a flash flood warning 'til 11:45.
Montgomery County on the East Side, seeing some heavier rains, but the heaviest rains, and Mary and I were looking at this, some of the precip intensities, the rainfall intensities are in the five plus inches per hour in the heaviest parts, so these are tropical downpours causing some flash flooding.
Not everywhere, but there've been a number of water rescues already in Frederick and Montgomery Counties.
You see along I-66 and South seems to be the heaviest.
Silver Spring, you're starting to see, not quite as heavy rain move in but everywhere you see orange and red, very, very heavy rainfall for Fedex Field right across the heart of D.C.
Now moving down toward Alexandria here, just about to Franconia.
So our friends down in Mount Vernon and Lowertown and areas of Prince George's County outside the Beltway there.
Just generally South of Joint Base Andrews over toward Clinton and Melwood and Upper Marlboro, get ready as this whole mass of water is moving down towards you with that flash flood warning until 11:15, and Prince George's County, and we are gonna see better weather.
Once we get rid of this stuff this morning, we'll see the activity shift off to the South and West as we get into the afternoon.
So the next one to two hours could be particularly bad with flooding but it will get better this afternoon, Ellen.
I hope so 'cause the roads are not looking good right now.
This is a live look at the Beltway.
We had a closure here.
They've just opened a second left lane on the inner loop of the the Beltway by the American Legion Bridge.
Let me show you some of the backups because this has been going on for a while.
It sounds like there was a tree that fell onto a vehicle, caused some sort of accident.
They're trying to move it over to the right hand side as quickly as possible but you can see from that camera, that's what traffic looks like, trying to head around the inner loop of the Beltway.
You're jammed coming from the Springfield interchange.
This is my maps to show you some of the delays.
I-270 southbound, not looking good.
The Beltway is not looking good, and I'm also now seeing reports in North Arlington of several flooded streets that we're having some water rescues with.
We've had many rescues up in Frederick as well, following Frederick County, their police department's Twitter page.
They've been just tweeting out closures like crazy.
These are just the main streets, not even the side streets.
