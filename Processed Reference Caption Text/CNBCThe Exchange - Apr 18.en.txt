Darden Restaurants, I think that that one is a good one right now. I think they're going to continue to raise and beat in the restaurant sector per my Analyst Lin Collier at Luke Capital, we're going with it.
[Scott] All right Kate Moore, always good to have you here.
Yeah, consumers what I'm watching the most next week during earnings.
I think we're going to get a lot of different reads about the staples and the discretionary side with unemployment at multi-decade lows, wages growing.
I think this is the big thing that can change sentiment.
[Scott] Okay, Weis, quick, what do you got?
[Weis] Illumina.
[Scott] Josh Brown?
[Josh] I'm going with Twitter.
Motorola Solutions MSI.
All right, good stuff.
Thanks everybody.
Good weekend, good holiday as well.
The Exchange starts now.
And thank you Scott.
Hi everybody, I am Brian Sullivan in for Kelly Evans today and here's what's ahead: D.C. and Your Money.
Politicians in America will debate the meaning of the Mueller Report, but we ask could it lead to even more gridlock and standstill in D.C.?
We're going to review the impact on your money ahead.
Pinning and conferencing, Zoom and Pinterest hitting the market to a lot of investor fanfare, but could they suffer ultimately the same fate as Lyft shareholders?
Plus, a fold fail, a cannabis consolidation, a recyclable shoe, you heard that right, and a new legal smoking age.
That's what's ahead in Rapid Fire.
It's a big league show with lots to do, but as we always do let's start with Your Money.
Dom Chu is here now with a DOW that is up, what?
Almost 100 points and stable right now for the most part Sulli.
If you take a look at the markets overall, nixed only because the NASDAQ is lagging off by about 1/10th of 1%.
Still though, the S&P up by about three points and the DOW Industrials just about 100 points to the upside.
That's pretty decent overall, we'll see if that sticks.
One particular industry group to focus on, the transportation stocks.
The iShares Dow Jones Transportation ETF, which tracks the Dow Transports, right now the highest levels that we've seen going all the way back to December third, so Transport's a big part of that story.
Union Pacific earnings better than expected, that's driving the trade there and if you're looking for one of the stocks of the day that's not Zoom, that's not Pinterest, check out Blackstone.
Look at this, 8.5% gains.
A publicly traded partnership for private equity that's going to become a publicly traded corporation, that new structure giving a boost to those shares.
A lot more investors could come in the mix and they raised a lot of money, Brian, for their funds last year, back over to you.
Yeah, Schwartz been on Squawk Box talking that up this morning.
Dom Chiu will see you in it a bit, thank you very much. All right so and the markets that Dom just walked you through have two new members to welcome into the fold today. Of course you've heard the names, Pinterest and Zoom both are now public,both rising.
Just adding to the list of names, including some very under-the-radar ones.
that have done very well when they hit the tape.
Bob Pisani is at the New York Stock Exchange with more and Bob, Zoom, what a day.
Both of them.
I mean not only, the floodgates have really opened Brian, not only did they raise the terms going into it but they popped at the open as well.
Let's just take a look here.
Pinterest, very simple.
Price talk was 15 to 17, they priced it at 19 but wait a minute, it opened at $23.75 and take a look at it in intraday trading here, on very heavy volume here, they're gonna trade the whole float today.
It's holding up very well, up $24.35.
Zoom though, 28 to 32.
Just four or five days ago we were talking about 28 to 32 for Zoom.
It priced at 36, that's not a typo.
It opened at $65.
This is very rare to see something that essentially opens twice as high as anybody thought it would a week ago and you see a trading right here at $63, just off that number.
Of course it's profitable, A lot of people like that.
It's got 100% growth and those are the two magic words that we've got.
Recent IPOs that joins the parade, they've done really well.
Jumia, PagerDuty, Tufin, Levi Strauss, which is one of the few profitable companies, all doing great.
Lyft is one of the few companies still to the downside.
No companies next week Brian but the week after we'll probably get another slew, maybe iHeartMedia, maybe next Friday a week from tomorrow, maybe we'll get Uber giving us some terms.
We'll see, not quite sure yet about that.
Big stuff there Bob Pisani, thank you very much.
All right now to Washington because the other big thing to hit the tape today was the Mueller Report.
It is perhaps more heavily redacted than many had thought or hoped, but at 400 or so pages long our team is still pouring through it.
Eamon Javers live at the White House with what we have learned so far.
Eamon, your key takeaways.
Yeah, Brian that's right.
We are still trying to digest this 400 page report and going through it for all of the details here.
The headline is out there and the President's been saying that throughout the day, no collusion, no obstruction.
That's good news for this White House.
Inside the document we're finding some of the areas of concern for Robert Mueller particularly around the area of potential obstruction of justice and the President's public statements, his tweets even about some of the people involved in this whole situation, those were red flags from Robert Mueller in certain circumstances.
Particularly on this idea.
All right so when we get Eamon back up, we're gonna come back and talk more about that certainly here.
Somebody pulled the plug literally on Eamon there as well, but luck we've got a couple smart folks surrounding us right now to dig more into this.
Let's talk more about what this all means for Washington, the markets, and policy going forward.
We're gonna CNBC this story.
Let's bring in Libby Cantrell Head of Public Policy at PIMCO
