Lets get started.
We have our brand new interview with pop sensations Pentatonix joining us from their first ever world tour.
Plus we have wedding guest fashion secrets.
Were telling you how you can look your best without of course upstaging the bride cmon on now.
All that in minutes the stars brought their craziest most overthetop looks ever to this years Met Gala.
The theme was camp notes of fashion and everyone was expected to pull out all the stops but hold up what is camp?
Well it is defined as the love of the unnatural of artifice and exaggeration basically everything that is fabulous ironic or extra.
So lets get to the fashion and the title this year for the most lit definitely goes to Katy Perry whether ya hate it or ya like it she definitely is having people talking.
She wore this illuminated chandelier look it was created for her by Jeremy Scott of Moschino.
Kim Kardashian showed off her figure in this skin tight latex corseted dress Jeff Looks like a bottle of perfume.
Sam by Thierry Mugler who came out of retirement to create the look which took you guys eight months to complete by the way.
It appeared to be dripping wet thanks in part to the crystals and shimmery material.
Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx made their public debut as a couple last night.
While they didnt hit the pink carpet together the couple did pose for photos with one another inside and Kendall and Kylie Jenner broke out the feathers for their camp looks.
Kendall wore bright orange feathered Versace gown while Kylie opted for a lilac look with a fur stohl Im hoping faux and a matching wig.
Actress Janelle Monae embraced wearable art with this custom Christian Siriano look and the eye even winked as she walked down the pink carpet.
Come on now.
Lady Gaga served up multiple looks for her grand entrance to the event all created by Brandon Maxwell.
It started off with a huge pink dress that took an army of men with umbrellas to wrangle she then stripped down to a black dress followed by a skin tight pink dress and then it all ended up with her posing in her underwear here it comes.
Yes girl with huge platform shoes.
Serena Williams wore this stunning neon yellow Versace gown with pink feathery leaf accents and she paired her look with neon Nikes.
Jennifer Lopez sparkled in this beaded Versace dress with a plunging neckline and fringe detailing.
She wore a matching headpiece and of course Arod I mean Tory makes a good accessory am I right?
Tory Mmm bah!
Sam Okay Lupita Nyongo embraced the rainbow with this Versace gown with pink star pattern and rainbow ruffles and check out the gold afro picks in her hair with raised fist logos yes.
Jared Leto my favorite had the best accessory of the night.
A custom replica of his head.
He brought it along while rocking this red Gucci dress.
Kacey Musgraves looked like a barbie doll in this hot pink Moschino leather dress pairing it with a blow dryer bag and cat eye shades.
Cardi B won the award for the biggest train with this red feathered Tom Brown gown.
The 10 foot long train nearly took over the pink carpet and Cierra might have won best hair of the night I think she won lets be honest with this very extra gorgeous afro.
She also wore a custom Peter Dundas emerald green crown because she is a queen and Zendaya had a fairy tale moment at the gala transforming into Cinderella in this Tommy Hilfiger ball gown with white poofy sleeves and a skirt that lit up yes yes yes.
Sam you drink some water well talk.
Are you I actually looked at Al or Al I looked at Jeff midway and your eyes were closed.
Dude I was out.
I was thinking about cheese and crackers and what Im gonna do tonight.
You know what I was thinking?
Im like this coffees bitter I should think about a different kind of coffee.
laughs I guess Im the only one I was kinda into it Sam.
really appreciated the looks as art.
Say what you want.
It took all those people got together to entertain us I agree.
like thats all I mean its just like somebodys gotta shake it up a little bit we all cant wear khakis and polo shirts somebodys gotta shake it up and push the envelope a little bit thats what art does.
Im for universal uniforms everyday.
Like Star Trek?
Yes!
Boring!
Boring I wear the same thing to work everyday thats fine with me.
Yeah thats a man of a certain age Id do the same thing I got those green sweat pants they could walk to work themselves.
Ive noticed that too.
Now Tory do you have a favorite even though I guess you were bored by it?
No no I did have a favorite Ezra Miller I though absolutely nailed camp.
And this is a guy that is gender fluid and he used prosthetics as the eyes Wow!
And you really get that kid Wait wait wait those werent real eyes?
I know I dont know what I said it like that.
Those were real eyes.
But its about the artifice and the exaggeration and I like the gender fluidity that was all over the red carpet Sam It was.
the pink carpet excuse me.
Yeah I loved that too Im with you Al?
Imma nod my head and pretend like I know what artifice means.
Sam laughs The artificialness like its fake like camp is very kitschy and fake and over done.
Sam Right now.
Now what does kitschy mean?
Sam Same thing.
Campy yeah.
Al Okay thank you.
Now Al we do call you Al Fashion Jackson Yes maam.
so you had to have a favorite.
Oh my boy Nick Jonas.
I mean that is like Sam Your boy huh?
Yeah we go way back but I just like he looks like He looks like little finger.
He looks like a waiter at The Cheesecake Factory doesnt he?
Tory Yeah.
laughs Jeff Like Dubai.
Al Yeah like Sam In Dubai.
Al makes me hungry.
Tory A lot of people yes.
The Dubai Cheesecake Factory.
Thats it thats it Thats a good one.
thats their uniforms.
You nailed it you nailed it Jeff do you have a favorite?
Well listen I know everyone hates Kylie and Kendall the Kardashians or Jenners I should say check them out they look terrific but I dont like that they didnt walk with their dates down the red or the pink carpet.
Thats a good one thats a good one.
Hey Im gonna listen I think all the work that these fashion designers put into these outfits I really wanna give them some credit I know Al Sam who was your favorite?
Sam Janelle Monae that is a work of art.
That dress is art you guys and then again with the gender fluidity I think that Jared Leto with that gorgeous red Gucci gown and then who doesnt love a severed head as a purse.
I really didnt even notice he was wearing a gown and I think thats the way if you dont want people to notice just carry another head.
I really did not notice he was wearing a gown till you said something.
Jeff Wait thats a purse?
I believe it was a purse.
I think it was or an accessory but he held it like a purse.
Sam He held it like a purse.
Tory He sure did.
Sam I hey Im all for it.
Al So we dont know.
Tory Lookin good Jared.
I dont know.
Al Now what if Mark showed up with that purse of your head?
Jeff Fashion.
Sam Yeah exactly fashion.
All right lets get this next story an update to the college admission scandal.
Lori Loughlins defense might have just gotten a boost thanks to the University of Southern Californias crew team.
Teams that reports this ad for the team is posted all over campus.
You can see it says no experience no problem.
Some say the poster could help Loris defense that her daughters lack of experience doesnt matter the team doesnt require experience to join.
Lori of course is accused of paying bribes to pass her daughters off as athletic recruits in order to get them into USC.
Now Tory I know you are our legal eagle this makes my blood boil.
Tory Yeah.
Because if Lori Loughlin is going to use this as her defense shes suggesting that all of us are stupid.
Tory Yep.
Shes suggesting that everybody out there that has worked hard to get into a university whether you are an athlete whether you are as a scholar again is stupid so could this work for her?
Yeah it could go both ways right?
It could backfire completely because its so obvious.
We have her on tape being like Take a picture of them on rowing machines and send it in.
We know the real thing.
She insulted so many people when she plead not guilty.
Thats really where she made her mistake as we talked before.
Now it only takes one person to be like Maybe she didnt know though.
So they are using the loophole defense its a long shot its a Hail Mary but its worked before and all she wants to do is avoid prison time.
Jeff And I think she is gonna do that.
Tory You do?
And I dont think so.
I think shes gonna listen.
Shes not calling us stupid our judicial system is calling us stupid the lawyers that defend her are calling us stupid because if she gets off its just proof that our system does not work.
Sam Youre right.
And thats whats gonna happ shes gonna walk But our.
because you could buy your way out of jail if you have enough money.
And many would argue our system works in the opposite way because you do have women of color that are locked up for oh Im sorry sending their kid to a public school in a different zip code.
So Al does the judicial system work or does it not work depending on how you look at it inside what lens?
I think its working perfectly.
Sam Unfortunately.
It caters to the rich I mean if you are rich you dont see jail as a deterrent.
Like anybody thats got some money you can get a good attorney Tory you know this the reason lawyers cost different amounts of money and some are free is a free lawyer is gonna be like Sam take the deal. where as a great lawyer is gonna go through everything.
Did they say the or thee when they Mirandized you?
Theyre gonna figure out Wow.
and all they need is one thing and thats why you pay that money and if you have money youre gonna get that lawyer and theyre gonna get you off so thats why Jeff feels like that cause its true.
Yeah its disappointing shame on her and shame on the judicial system Yeah.
We need reform and we need reform now.

Announcer Next Dr.Phil.
Today at four followed by WUSA 9 news at five.
Welcome back to DBL it is time for fifth host when we talk about what youre talkin about.
A Texas bartender has been arrested and charged for over serving a man the night he shot and killed eight people.
Lindsay Glass is accused of violating a state law by selling alcohol to an intoxicated or insane person.
Police say she should have known to stop serving the man because he appeared drunk and armed.
Turned out his blood alcohol level was more than four times the legal limit.
After leaving the bar the man killed his estranged wife and seven others before dying in a police shootout.
The bartender now faces up to a year in prison a fine of 500 or both.
Should she be charged with a crime?
Now she wouldnt be charged for murder this would be a misdemeanor so to speak I just wanna clarify that.
Sad story Bobby from Facebook says I think the bartender is responsible for keeping patrons from becoming unreasonably intoxicated but only the shooter is responsible for murder.
Bobby great take you used the perfect word there unreasonably intoxicated and with your BAC at four times the legal limit that means that you probably cant stand up.
The fact that this man was armed at least to the point where she was aware of it I think that she should be implicated in some way.
I dont know my whole thing Im not about throwing people in jail.
I mean this could be used to teach other people.
I mean you shouldnt have to teach people not to serve drunk people with guns but some people gotta learn that lesson I guess.
Yeah.
Yeah Patty from Facebook says Bars are just out to make money.
They dont care about the dangers of alcohol.
This needs to change.
I know Sam you were a bartender and you can speak.
Sam Jeff too.
And Jeff too and there are very strict laws about serving people that you can reasonably see are over served.
Oh they make an example of that.
Yeah.
Jeff Oh yeah.
In Los Angeles its a corporation called the ABC they train you they make sure to let you know about those red flags and God forbid you over serve someone both Jeff and I have cut many people off but we both seen people Jeff Oh yeah.
our colleagues dragged out of that bar in handcuffs to make a point Tory For serving.
because of a DUI you could kill someone you could kill yourself.
Right they dont bring them out the back door they make sure all the servers see it they bring him out the front door they make an example like they handcuff em so it is a big deal.
Youre serving a drug And I think it should and I Yeah Tory alcohols a drug.
And I think you should be liable if youre a gun maker and you sell to an underage person by mistake youre liable and they shoot people youre also liable so I think she broke the law.
And I do wanna set this up though.
Weve talked about this story we set it up for a minute.
We dont know if this guy was coming up to the bar we dont know the whole what was going on obviously Ive seen someone fall out of a chair I know to cut them off.
If theyre all over the place and theyre coming to get drinks I dont know.
Im not responsible.
Sam Yeah are they drinking in the bathroom Right we dont are they properly trained Did they drink before they came so theres a lot that goes in this we cant just speculate on what the bartender did or did not see.
But Marcus from Facebook says How would the bartender have known what this guy was going to do after he left the bar?
Hold people accountable for their own actions.
Marcus I love you for saying that.
Accountability I think a word that has been erased from the dictionary.
Be accountable for your own actions not because youre fifth grade teacher gave you an F and called you a name thats why you went and shot up everybody not because the bartender over served you thats why you went and shot up everybody?
Hold this man accountable.
Does this lady need to do her job depending on the circumstances?
Maybe.
This mans accountable.
Not anybody else.
Hes the one who killed eight people lets not forget that.
Got it all right.
Sorry.
Oh great takes everybody thanks for writing in.

Welcome back to DBL making the right food choices can be tough in todays so nutritious sponsored by SoClean Tory Shulman meets up with a nutritionist to learn about foods thatll help you sleep better.
Take a look.
Hey guys we are here with Sara Peternell she is a holistic nutritionist at Family Nutrition Services and she is here to tell us how food can affect your sleep.
I know mind blown.
Talk to me about how sleep and eating go together cause I never thought about that.
Absolutely who hasnt had trouble sleeping Yes!
at one point or another I know I have.
What are some specific foods so I know to stock?
There are foods that are rich in an amino acid called tryptophan.
The first one isTurkey yeah yeah.
you said it.
Exactly thats why everybodys so sleepy on Thanksgiving.
Right.
But nuts are a really good accessible source of tryptophan.
Almonds brazil nuts walnuts just eating a quarter cup of these per day can really help to boost your tryptophan levels which converts in the body to serotonin.
Wow so youd be nuts not to do it.
You would be totally nuts not to do laughs.
Sorry.
All right so what else other than nuts?
So my favorite one of all is actually cherries.
Cherries when they contain melatonin they actually just help to contribute to your bodies own production of melatonin.
This sleep hormone is one of the hormones that regulates like our circadian rhythm.
So cherries nuts what else?
Fish is actually a sleep remedy Really?
and its not thought of but it should be because it has a very high level of vitamin B6.
And B6 helps you sleep?
Vitamin B6 is actually important for that conversion of tryptophan to serotonin.
Oh I see.
So when were talking about nuts you know we use the amino acid in our bodies to convert to serotonin but if youre low in B6 that conversion doesnt take place quite as naturally.
I want to thank Sarah Peternell for dealing with me first off and for teaching us some accessible things you can do right now at the grocery store to help your own body naturally get to some Zs.
I guess I need to stock up on cherries cause momma hasnt been sleepin.
Youve been having some trouble and she also mentioned to me yogurt.
So if you make a smoothie and include all of this yogurt cherries walnuts you can sort of make a sleepy time smoothie.
So if you think maybe you know right when youre feeding Sof maybe you give yourself a little sleepy time smoothie and you get in the mood to sleep.
Heres whats coming up next on DBL.
