[Announcer] This is Daily Blast Live.
We are talking about what you're talking about.
'Cause everyone's talking about this.
[Announcer] Always live, always real, always unpredictable.
You are totally off-base here!
[Announcer] Log on and join our live conversation.
I can't believe I'm saying this, I do agree with you.
[Announcer] DBL starts right now.
[Director] Three, two.
Welcome to DBL.
It's Wednesday, February 13th.
We are live and we are talking about what you're talking about.
I'm here with Tory, Jeff, Al, and I'm Sam.
And if you haven't noticed, we have a very special guest co-host.
You all know him as Dr. Drew Pinsky, but you're so much more to me.
I know you've heard this a gazillion times by now but you're not only a friend, you're my mentor, and I really do owe sitting in this chair to you.
So, thank you.
There's a reason we worked with you.
You're good.
Aww, Drew!
So that's that.
That means so much to me.
[Al] Emergency fallout.
Wow, Al.
Geez!
I love some Sammy.
Okay, it's harsh.
Well, thank you for being here, Dr.Drew.
We begin with an update to a story we've been tracking.
Empire star Jussie Smollett is hitting back at reports that he has changed his story, or has not been fully cooperative with police who are investigating his alleged attack.
Jussie's reps released a statement that says in part, Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie's account of what happened that night consistent and credible.
Superintendent Johnson has been clear from day one that Jussie is a victim.
This comes a day after a spokesperson for the Chicago Police Department said that the phone records that Jussie turned over, Do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation as they were limited and heavily redacted.
Now, Jussie's reps contend that information was redacted to protect the privacy of personal contacts and other high-profile people who had nothing to do with the attack, and tomorrow, Jussie is sitting down with GMA's Robin Roberts in what looks to be a highly emotional interview.
Check out this teaser.
At any point during the attack, did you fear for your life?
[Jeff] I'm good.
So, very emotional interview.
Dr.Drew, I know on your radio show, you've been following this case in and out.
What would you say to the narrative out there that's pushing that he may be making this up?
Yeah, I just think everyone needs to calm down and not grab onto any narrative.
It's not our job to create a narrative, it's the Chicago PD's to figure out the facts and put that narrative together and then tell us what the deal is.
Something happened to him.
If he has overstated it for some reason, I'm also still worried about him and what happened that made him distort this thing.
