It's happened again, California bracing with a second earthquake striking foundations and roads cracking, fires erupting and now the fear another one could be coming as California Governor Gavin Newsome declares a state of emergency in San Bernardino County.
Welcome, everybody, happy weekend, I'm Neil Cavuto and you're looking live at Los Angeles International Airport, where all is calm right now after a second quake in as many days strikes north of the major city, near Ridgecrest, California where the first one epicentered.
That's where you'll find our Jeff Paul, in the middle of it all.
Jeff, how are things there now?
Yeah, Neil, I would say there's a general feeling of uneasiness.
Two days, two big, massive earthquakes, right here, near this town in California and this latest one, a magnitude 7.1.
It is followed by several aftershocks, within just the last few minutes or so while we were waiting to speak with you, we felt several of them out here at city hall.
And that uneasiness is leading towards many people just not wanting to sleep inside their house last night.
In fact, we caught up with one sheriff's deputy who told us, while they were out patrolling, going street-by-street to make sure people were okay 
and accounted for, he saw a lot of people either sleeping outside or coming here to city hall, where there is a shelter set up.
Now I want to go to a moment here, maybe we can pull up the actual sound on this, this was the moment we were at a restaurant.
We started to feel the rumbling, the violent shaking and this is what happened right after that, take a listen.
Yeah, you could really hear the panic on people's voices.
This again, was a restaurant right here in Ridgecrest and there was a slight aftershock before this and everyone sort of, they'd been through a few of 'em in the last day.
But then this next one, the 7.1, the whole building was shaking, dishes were crashing on the ground and you could see some of the people out there, just walking out in disbelief, some people hitting the ground, coming to tears.
And shortly after walking out of this restaurant and collecting ourselves, we look off into the distance and we see a huge plume of smoke.
We get closer and realize that this house is on fire and we do know that this is at least one house that was set on fire.
A lot of these fires start because of ruptured gas lines.
Incredibly, we're only hearing of some minor injuries due to broken glass or things falling on people, no reports of any deaths, but the governor here has declared a state of emergency and has requested a presidential declaration for some help out here from the Federal Government.
So far, the President hasn't Tweeted about what's happened here lately in California.
Neil. All right, Jeff, thank you very, very much and as Jeff pointed out, the California Governor Gavin Newsome has already declared a state of emergency in at least San Bernardino County as officials assess the damage, brace for more.
And that's what has everyone on tenterhooks, what kind of more does that mean?
How much more, how significant? On the phone with us is Public Information Officer from California Governor's Office of Emergency Services, Bryan May.
Bryan, thank you for taking the time.
How are things looking there now?
[Bryan] Well, we've been working overnight since this second earthquake happened yesterday evening.
Unfortunately for us, that second earthquake happened right before sunset, darkness prevented us from being able to do a lot of assessment overnight.
We've just had sunrise here in California in the last hour or so, so right now is crucial for us, as we're getting into Ridgecrest and into the affected areas, to see what kind of damage we're talking about.
Injuries, we've heard there are some, but we're not quite sure how much. And of course you heard of people who don't want to go inside their homes right now.
We need to get in and see what the needs are so that we can meet those needs. [Neil] Now blessedly, we've not heard any reports of significant injuries or worse, is that still the case?
