It got infected, so they had to remove the bone, like the skull.
Francesca?
Yes.
If I follow normal protocol on this, you'll end up with no car.
[Announcer] This is the courtroom of Judge Frank Caprio, where people and cases are met with compassion, a different kind of judge, a courtroom like no other, this is Caught in Providence.
Who's Mr. Holder?
This is Mr. Holder, Your Honor.
And are you here with him?
Yes, I'm his counselor at the Riverwood program.
Okay, who's gonna do the speaking?
I am at Mr. Holder's request.
[Frank] Alright, what do you wanna tell me about this?
Basically he received the ticket on Sunday morning,
it started all his first park- Saturday.
I'm sorry?
Saturday. Saturday morning, I'm sorry,
it's not at all his first ticket.
He's had 31 tickets.
Obviously I'm his counselor for significant reasons,
at the same time it's something that we're working on engagingly with Mr. Holder
and truthfully speaking, the tickets are becoming further and further apart.
He happened to have been parked across from Parenside Park in front of the old Bank of America building on this particular morning, he was attending a church service.
Sometimes he goes there also to meet up with his daughter, who's currently in a homeless situation.
So we are hoping that Your Honor could find a reason hopefully to waive this and know that we're working actively in terms of keeping this from happening.
Is he homeless now?
Currently speaking he lives with his father at an assisted living residence in East providence, but actually we have an appointment next week with the Gateway group to hopefully line up housing, affordable housing in North Providence.
Tell me about the program, I don't know what the program is about.
We're a social services agency, we're under the Horizon Group, we have two locations, one in Providence, one in Warren, Rhode Island, you know, in the East Bay area.
From there on out, Mr. Holder's been a longtime client of ours and I've been working as his counselor throughout the last nine months.
What's the name of the program?
Riverwood, one word.
Are you familiar with that?
[Ziggy] No, but I am familiar with Horizon, I have heard of that.
It's basically human services and social work, primarily the role of the Providence program is to provide affordable housing for low income individuals.
Based on your representations, I'm gonna dismiss it.
Thank you.
But I want Mr. Holder to know that this doesn't give you a license in the future to say it's okay, I'll bring my counselor down, I can get away with it, okay, I'm doing this based on his representation.
Do you understand that?
You explain it to him, when he gets out, 'cause he's homeless, okay, alright.
It's our intention to avoid it, if at all possible, thank you, Your Honor.
Okay.
I'm just trying to see if he gives me attitude.
Despite what you may be thinking, I believe this motorist actually made two wise choices in court today, the first, having his social worker speak for him.
Can you imagine what would have happened, if he had opened his mouth?
I think he'd still be enjoying the hospitality of one of our local correctional institutions.
The second is that he waited until he passed Inspector Kerrigan, before he disrespected the judge.
Trust me, that may have been the wisest move of his life.
[Frank] Anthony Michael Giacobi, good morning, Mr. Giacobi.
Morning, sir.
What do your friends call you, they call you Tony, they call you AM, what do they call you?
I can't say what they call me.
I expected that kind of an answer.
Where are you from, Nevada?
Yes, sir.
Yeah?
What are you doing in Rhode Island?
What am I doing?
I moved back here stupidly.
Are you calling me stupid?
I was thinking about it, but I-
Listen, I'm gonna tell you something, that's not nice.
Mr. Giacobi, you're charged with going through a red light on Allens Avenue and Terminal Street, are we watching these today?
We should watch it.
Yes, we need to see it, judge.
Alright, here's what we're gonna do, Mr. Giacobi, I'm gonna watch it.
Now there are two lines on Allens Avenue, there are two stop lines, if you are passed the first stop line, when the light turns red, I'll dismiss it, if you're not passed it, it's gonna cost you 85 bucks, we're gonna take a look at it, look up here.
[Ziggy] It's already red, judge, show the time link, it was red for 16.2 seconds, judge.
If I look at this, I look at this every day and I'm supposed to know that when the light clicks three times, that it's red, I'm supposed to know that, I think we're all supposed to know that.
So they send me this kind of a video, in a court of law, I can't tell what color the light is, I know it changed three times, Inspector Quinn, but it went from white to white to white.
No, it didn't change at all, judge.
It stayed red according to the notice, but according to the video, I agree with you, judge, I couldn't determine as to whether-
No, I am not convinced by clear and convincing evidence, they didn't present clear and convincing evidence to me, that the light was red, I never saw red on the screen, I saw it all white.
I know it changed three times, but I don't know if when it changed three times, what color it was.
That's a very long story, but the result is that I'm gonna dismiss the case, because the city has failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that you went through a red light.
Now is there anything you wanna say?
Thank you.
Oh.
He's never told me what your friends call you.
What do your friends call you, they call you Tony, they call you Anthony, what do they call you?
His middle name.
Thank you, sir.
Well, I guess we had it coming, the judge did ask him three times what his friends called him, based on his response, we know he wasn't lying, he really is an (bleep).
[Frank] Josev Parentos.
Good morning, Your Honor.
You've a parking ticket on Thayer Street, sir?
Yes.
That day I wasn't driving the car, I was just getting out the hospital, 'cause I had brain surgery and my son literally parked at the corner of CVS and I got in the car and the lady said, You can't park there, it's a fire hydrant, and I said, oh, alright, I understand, I've had brain surgery, I had my helmet on and then she says, Yeah, sure, she didn't really believe me.
I got in the car and then we left and then I got in the mail, the ticket, she didn't even give us a ticket on the way she was or anything.
Alright, case is dismissed.
I appreciate it, Your Honor, thank you.
Good luck.
Thanks.
How are you feeling?
Good.
I can't hear you, speak into the mic.
Alright.
I had brain cancer surgery and then it got infected, so they had to remove the bone, like the skull of my head.
The skull?
Yeah.
So that's why you're wearing a helmet?
It's why I'm wearing a helmet, yes.
Yeah.
So hopefully in October I'm good.
Okay, we're rooting for you, good luck.
[Josev] I appreciate it, thank you.
I got divorced from him maybe about six or seven years ago,
[Frank] Yeah.
right before he went to federal prison for 15 years.
You're telling me all these bad things about him, but when he comes in, you let him use the car?
It's just a cough.
Yeah, right and the Earth is flat.
[Announcer] Treat your cough seriously with Robitussin CF Max, nothing lasts longer and treats more symptoms for your cough, cold and flu.
Robitussin, because it's never just a cough.
We're doing karaoke later and you're gonna sing.
Jamie, this is your house?
I know, it's not much, but it's home, right kids?
Kids?
Papa, Papa!
Oh!
You didn't tell me your friends were coming.
[Jamie] Oh, yeah.
This one is tiny like a child.
Yeah, she is.
Ah, but seriously, it's good to be surrounded by what matters most, a Home and Auto Bundle from Progressive.
Oh, sweetie, please, play for us.
Oh, no, I couldn't.
Please.
Okay.
