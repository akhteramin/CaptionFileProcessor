Well thanks so much to you for joining us today, I'm Jim Sciutto.

At This Hour With Kate Bolduan starts right now.
this is a 16 page report compiled by the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security.
Look at these images that we're showing right here.
What they found is shocking.
Mass overcrowding of children and adults, some with no access to showers or clean clothes. No laundry facilities. It's all detailed in the report.
Some children with no access to warm meals for days.
Adults forced into standing room only conditions for a week, the report says.
Officials describe the migrants even as banging on cell windows and holding up signs for help.
And then there are these images.
These are images drawn by children who recently were released from border facilities.
The drawings appear to show children, you know exactly what your eyes tell you.
In cages, in jail.
The American Academy of Pediatrics released these pictures, saying that these facilities, in their words, are no place for children.
It's a painful reminder of what these children are going through and are going through right now.
Let's get straight over to CNN's Nick Valencia.
He's at a border facility in El Paso, Texas.
Nick, what's the very latest?
Well, it's a bit of breaking news this morning.
We're hearing from acting DHS secretary, Kevin McAleenan about those social media posts.
Remember earlier this week Kate we reported, ProPublica, the investigative team first reported about this closed Facebook group that featured current and former they say, Border Patrol agents making lewd comments, derogatory comments, racially inflammatory comments, joking about dead migrants.
Well, now Kevin McAleenan the acting DHS secretary tweeting this this morning.
I have directed an immediate investigation, and as the U.S. Border Patrol Cheif has made clear, any employee found to have compromised the public's trust in our law enforcement mission will be held accountable.
What is a little bit unclear to us at this moment is we were under the understanding that earlier this week an investigation had already been under way.
The posts were said to have been turned over to the Internal Affairs at CBP, DHS.
Inspector General has also said to have gotten their hands on these social media posts.
A broader question though Kate, we're also wondering if he's calling for an investigation into these social media posts?
When will he call for an investigation into the conditions in these Border Patrol facilities?
And speaking on that, it was yesterday that I spoke to a long time veteran El Paso Border Patrol agent who said that they are just tired of seeing the conditions that migrants are being held in and decided to speak out.
So long as we concealed their identity.
You're taking a big risk by doing this.
[Agent] Yes, but America needs to know.
They need to know the truth.
[Nick] A Border Patrol agent who's had enough.
In a CNN exclusive interview, the veteran agent who agreed to go on camera only if their identity was concealed, expressed disgust at a closed Facebook group reportedly comprised of thousands of current and former agents.
ProPublica the first to expose the group, I'm 10-15, where members shared lewd and sexist content about Latina members of congress including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
The agent telling CNN being derogatory is part of the Border Patrol culture, even hearing a supervisor joke about dead migrants.
[Agent] He was making fun of them.
Saying what?
[Agent] That, what difference does it make, it's just another life.
He made a comment also regarding running over illegals
and I'm like, you cannot run over people.
[Nick] In describing the conditions inside the El Paso detention facilities, the agent compared them to a zoo.
[Agent] The holding facility, the cells, they are, what I would say, filthy.
We have a maintenance and cleaning crew that clean the general area, like the hallways, but I have never seen them cleaning pampers, or cleaning toilets in the cells or cleaning sinks in the cell.
Sometimes you go in a cell and there is trash everywhere.
There are those in leadership in Customs and Border Protection,
[Agent] Yes.
[Nick] They say, that migrants are getting basic human rights.
What do you say to leaders who are saying, migrants are getting basic human rights?
[Agent] What is basic human rights?
Toilet paper?
Water from the sink?
Wearing the same clothing for days?
I remember when there used to be a processing center, where we used to have, especially in winter, we used to have these blankets, and 10 different aliens would use the same blanket.
We would recycle them.
We'd put them in a bag and they wouldn't get wash.
I feel like, you know, multiple times during our interview you've sort of stared off in the distance and you've thought about some things that you've seen.
It seems as though there are things that you might take home with you.
[Agent] Everyday.
Like what?
[Agent] The kids.
[Nick] What about the kids?
