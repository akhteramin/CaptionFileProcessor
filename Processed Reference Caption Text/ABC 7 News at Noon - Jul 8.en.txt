 [Announcer] Now, ABC7 News At Noon on your side.
 And we are wishing you a happy 4th of July as we come on the air at noon.
 Millions all across the nation are celebrating America.
 So many events happening in our area, they're happening right now.
 The National Independence Day Parade is just kicking off.
 That happened just a short time ago and for now, it looks like the weather is cooperating but we are bracing for some storms and our Steve Rudin, he's got the timing and he is tracking all of this for us.
 Steve, happy 4th to you.
 Same to you Lindsey and we are looking at the greatest threat for those stronger storms or heavier downpours later on this afternoon into the early evening hours.
 Looking downstream on the Potomac from our camera atop The Watergate Hotel, we are dry right now but that is going to change over the next several hours.
 Do have a Flash Flood Watch for the D.C Metro including Montgomery County, Fairfax, Arlington, Alexandria, the District and Prince George's and also parts of Loudoun County until eight o'clock tonight.
 Here's StormWatch7's Satellite and Radar. A few showers beginning to bubble up just across North East D.C over toward Brookland moving off toward the North and East.
 Nothing heavy right now but as mentioned that will change as we head through the next several hours.
 Here's our FutureCast. This is the high resolution model. We're gonna stop it for you at two o'clock and look at how quickly this model has those storms popping up.
 They don't move very fast. Could bring heavy rains to the District, Arlington and Alexandria four pm and continue as we move into the all important six o'clock, seven o'clock hour.
 If there's any good news here, by eight o'clock tonight, showers become more limited and then the fireworks display is set to begin at 21:07 should go on at least according to this model here although the cloud deck may be a little bit on the low side.
 Worth watching and we're going to keep you updated.
 Look at these temperatures.
 88 degrees already at Reagan National Airport.
 That is just part of the story with feels like temperatures now in the middle 90s.
 We have a heat emergency posted for the District that is done by the District government.
 Cooling centers are open for those who need them.
 Coming up in a few minutes, an updated look at our FutureCast plus we're looking ahead to the rest of the long holiday weekend.
 Lindsey? All right Steve and we do want to talk about that just the weather is holding up so far for that National Independence Day Parade and our Nathan Baca is there.
 So Nathan, happy 4th of July to you.
 Just how crowded is it right now? Well it's getting more crowded.
 I'm gonna show you the situation right here.
 I'm gonna do some crowd surfing over here.
 So right now, I'm on seventh approaching Constitution Avenue.
 They are telling everybody to move back from the street.
 People wanna crowd onto the street.
 In fact, I'm happening to kind of move around some folks.
 Hey, how's it going, happy 4th of July everyone.
 So, this is what's going on right now.
 Just to give you context, here's the National Archives over here and you see some people here celebrating 4th of July.
 Where you guys visiting from? Anybody? Atlanta.
 Washington D.C.
 Oh good you guys are local, excellent.
 Well we, just to give you some context again, police are telling people to stay on back.
 That right there is the Parade and I'm gonna show you some of the floats on down the way.
 We've been noticing some bands.
 People have been coming here to hear those bands.
 In fact, this is what some people that were visiting, not only from Alexandria for the first time but also from Georgia had to say.
 The reason why we're out here is to celebrate the independence from Great Britain.
 Also our nation over the last 243 years really and then, to be amongst patriots.
 I don't see any controversy.
 Like I see everybody really coming together and I'm just like, it makes me happy cause we're not seeing anything so vulgar, anything ugly, it just makes me happy that everybody's here together to celebrate such a great day.
 All right now I talked about one of those bands.
 You see one of those bands right there.
 That is what she was coming to hear and there are plenty more bands and plenty more floats coming on by.
 So again, the situation here, we do have a lot more, I'll say, a lot more political signs, a lot more political hats and advertisements that typically you would see on a 4th of July parade but a lot of folks are here, just coming in from all around the country hoping to just get a good party and a good old D.C parade.
 Reporting live from Constitution and Seventh, Nathan Baca, ABC7 News.
 All right Nathan, enjoy it down there and that is just one of many parades going on in our area.
 The streets of Arlington, it was packed there for the annual Barcroft Parade.
 and this evening President Trump, he is going to do his Salute to America with an independence extravaganza featuring tanks, military flyovers and a speech at The Lincoln Memorial but some say the President is politicizing a national holiday.
 Mona Kosar Abdi has the very latest.
 [Mona] It will be "the show of a lifetime", President Trump has promised on Twitter ahead of his extravagant 4th of July celebration.
 A costly production, Trump has also promised will be worth the expense.
 An array of military hardware on display at The Lincoln Memorial including tanks that have already been ushered in.
 The Salute to America spectacle will also include multiple military flyovers and an extended fireworks show topped off with a speech from the Commander and Chief himself.
 We're gonna have planes going overhead.
 The best fighter jets in the world and other planes too.
 [Mona] But the event is setting off more than pyrotechnic devices.
 It's also sparking backlash from critics who accused the President of staging a glorified campaign rally and turning the celebration into a partisan event.
 The event is free but The White House has given VIP tickets to Republican National Committee and top donors.
 Congressman and 2020 Democratic Presidential candidate Seth Moulton, calling Trump's celebration quote "Unamerican".
 It reminds me of the Soviet Union.
 It's unpatriotic because that's, militarism is not what American patriotism is about.
 As for the price tag, neither the Administration nor the Pentagon has disclosed what the cost will be to taxpayers but ABC News has learned the National Park Service is reportedly diverting 2.
5 million dollars from improvement projects.
 President Trump adding overnight, the fireworks have been donated and the cost will quote "be very little compared to what it is worth" and the $750000 worth of fireworks were donated by an Ohio company that lobbied the President last month to hold off on new tariffs on China.
 The President announced he would do so the same day he announced the donation.
 Mona Kosar Abdi, ABC News, Washington.
 Security will be tight downtown today and tonight for Independence Day celebrations and for President Trump's Salute to America.
 Each event has strict guidelines on what you can bring and what you cannot.
 The priority is safety.
 No weapons, no alcohol, not even drones or balloons are allowed and for the Salute to America, no backpacks, no large purses, coolers or Tablets.
 For a complete list, you can head over to our website, WJLA.com and you can find everything that you need to know for today all in one list whether you're heading to events, wanting to avoid the city or watching fireworks in your neighborhood, it is all on our free ABC7 News app.
 we have a reminder this Independence Day that fireworks are not toys and they need to be used properly.
 The Consumer Products Safety Commission, they always do these demonstrations on the National Mall.
 This is what they did last week.
 They like to do these demonstrations to show just how quickly things can go wrong when fireworks are not handled properly.
 New data reveals that emergency rooms across the US treated more than nine thousand fireworks related injuries last year.
 More than half of those injuries involving young children were caused by Sparklers.
 Happening right now, the 103th Annual Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest is going on in Coney Island, New York and 11 time champ Joey Chestnut looks like he might make history again.
 He set a world record last year, he ate 74 hot dogs in 10 minutes.
 We are monitoring that and of course, we will have some video for you later.
 Coming up next at noon, it's probably the largest display of stars and stripes that you'll see this holiday.
