[Narrator] These women love the scents in this ground-breaking art exhibit.
It smells amazing.
Luxurious.
[Narrator] But what are they smelling?
[Woman At Exhibit] Wait it's Suave?
[Woman With Glasses ] It's body wash.
No it's not.
[Woman At Exhibit] I can't believe this is Suave.
Can I take this home (laughing)?
[Narrator] Suave Body Wash, fragrances as beautiful as Bath & Body Works.
(child's voice) Let's talk about Haribo Goldbears.
(child's voice) The red is more gooder to me cause it tastes like berries.
(child's voice) They're really squishy.

[Music] Kids and grown-ups love it so [Music] [Music] The happy world of Haribo [Music] [Max] All right we're back.

[Nev] So yesterday we did some research.
We don't know what to make of this.
We're a little befuddled.
Okay so here's where we started.
So the first thing we found, we searched his number, bingo.
Look what we got.
Number for five years, comes back to a Matt
This never happens.
He's in Florida where he says he lives. So this was kind of a- Good. Surprise. And he also has a Twitter.
Then there's some pictures back from 2012 that look like they're of him.
This would have been the Matt that you sort of started talking to.
Then we looked up his URL.
We actually got a bunch of hits. The first one was this.
A PlentyOfFish account that's up, I don't know how or when it was last active.
For a guy who lives in Kissimmee. 21 years old. This is. Six foot two.
There's also this photo.
It could be him.
I'm not sure if I should even make a comment.
I'm not sure what to say.
What's, are you upset?
I can't tell. Do you mind if I take a second?
Sure.
Yeah.
Take as much time as you need.
[Nev] You all right?
Mmmhmm.
[Nev] What was uh?
