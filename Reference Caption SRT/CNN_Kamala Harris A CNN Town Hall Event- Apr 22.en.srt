1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,060
- Five of the top presidential candidates

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,554
are sharing the same stage tonight

3
00:00:03,554 --> 00:00:05,360
for town halls with young adults.

4
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,070
And students who say
that they plan to vote

5
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,230
in their states' primaries and caucuses.

6
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,400
And they are right here
in the audience with us.

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,340
We've already heard from
Senators Amy Klobuchar,

8
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,870
Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.

9
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,607
And next hour we're gonna hear
from Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

10
00:00:18,607 --> 00:00:21,830
But right now it's time to
welcome to this very stage

11
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,626
Senator Kamala Harris of California.

12
00:00:24,626 --> 00:00:27,863
(audience applauds)

13
00:00:27,863 --> 00:00:29,446
- Hey guys, hi, hi.

14
00:00:32,148 --> 00:00:34,023
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

15
00:00:34,023 --> 00:00:36,284
- Good to be, have a seat.
- Thank you.

16
00:00:36,284 --> 00:00:38,277
- Wow they're happy to see you.

17
00:00:38,277 --> 00:00:40,527
- Hi, good to see you guys.

18
00:00:42,582 --> 00:00:44,350
- Now let's get to it because we want you

19
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:45,897
to get as much out the
next hour both of you.

20
00:00:45,897 --> 00:00:46,730
- That sounds great.

21
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:47,720
- All of you as possible

22
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,120
so let's start with what's dominating

23
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:49,953
the news right now.

24
00:00:49,953 --> 00:00:52,117
And You know that's the fallout
from the Mueller report.

25
00:00:52,117 --> 00:00:52,950
- [Kamala] Yes.

26
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,070
- We have a question from
her name is Karla Alvarado,

27
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,480
she's right there to the right.

28
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,500
And Karla is a senior
at Harvard University

29
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,150
from Massachusetts, Karla.

30
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,240
- Good evening Senator Harris.

31
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,190
Thank you for joining us this evening.

32
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:04,580
In light of Mueller's report,

33
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,310
do you believe the Democrats in Congress

34
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:09,310
should reconsider their
position on impeachment?

35
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,720
- Well it depends on who you're talking to

36
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,300
and what their position is.

37
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,740
But here's how I feel about it

38
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,220
and thank you for the question Karla.

39
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,970
Look, for those of us
who have been following

40
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:22,880
the investigation and have
seen any part of that report.

41
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,810
It is very clear that there
is a lot of good evidence

42
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,630
pointing to obstruction
and obstruction of justice.

43
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,400
And I believe very strongly,
first of all let me

44
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,070
just be very clear about the table set.

45
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,970
I believe that we need to
get rid of this president

46
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,420
that's why I'm running for

47
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,060
to become president of the United States.

48
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,150
So that is part of the
premise obviously of my point.

49
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,480
But I think we have very
good reason to believe

50
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,130
that there is an investigation
that has been conducted,

51
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:48,240
which has produced evidence

52
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,650
that tells us that this
president and his administration

53
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,430
engaged in obstruction of justice.

54
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,530
I believe congress should

55
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,741
take the steps towards impeachment.

56
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:59,741
(audience applauds)

57
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,940
But I wanna say this because
it doesn't end there,

58
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,850
I also wanna say this.

59
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,060
I am also a realist and
when I look at what has been

60
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,500
happening over the two
years and some months

61
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,970
that I've been in the
United States Senate.

62
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:17,350
I have also witnessed folks
in the United States Congress

63
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,490
and in particular in the GOP.

64
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:22,920
Who have been presented with
many reasons to push back

65
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,710
against this president and they have not.

66
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,740
And when we look at the
impeachment process.

67
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,570
There will be what happens in the House,

68
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,350
an investigation that takes place.

69
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,580
I think we can be pretty
sure that it looks like that

70
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,020
is very likely to happen.

71
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,810
And then it's gonna go over
to the Senate and in the House

72
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:42,149
there needs to be a vote by a
majority, a simple majority.

73
00:02:42,149 --> 00:02:43,990
And then it's gonna
come over to the senate.

74
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:46,070
And I've not seen any evidence

75
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,380
since I've been in the
United States Senate.

76
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,690
That the United States Senate

77
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,630
and the Republicans hold the majority.

78
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,920
I've not seen any evidence to suggest

79
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,920
that they will weigh on the facts

80
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,150
instead of on partisan adherence

81
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,990
to being protective of this president.

82
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,110
And that's what concerns me

83
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,540
and what will be the eventual outcome.

84
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,020
So we have to be realistic about

85
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,610
what might be the end result.

86
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,800
But that doesn't mean the
process should not take hold.

87
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,960
- All right thank you Senator.

88
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,810
Let's talk about you cause
a lot of the young folks.

89
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:13,643
A lot of the students here

90
00:03:13,643 --> 00:03:15,260
at the Harvard Institute of Politics.

91
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,210
They're concerned about how
gun violence might affect them

92
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:20,230
or family members, someone
who's close to them.

93
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,480
On that topic is Ben Bernier,
he's standing right there.

94
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,620
He's a student at the
University of New Hampshire

95
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,980
studying history, he is
from Massachusetts, Ben.

96
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,300
- Thank you, thank you Senator.

97
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,133
- Hi Ben.

98
00:03:30,133 --> 00:03:32,050
- As a future educator I'm really bothered

99
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:35,093
that public schools are being
targets for mass shootings.

100
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,620
Two days ago was the 20th anniversary

101
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,190
of the Columbine Massacre.

102
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,740
But still two decades later

103
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,770
no major gun control
legislation has been passed.

104
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:46,610
So my question is as president,
how will you go about

105
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,470
keeping our schools safe and
keeping guns out of the hands

106
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,100
of those who should not have them?

107
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,240
- Thank you Ben and I'm
sure that there are plenty

108
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,800
of students here who while
you were in high school,

109
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,770
even middle school,

110
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:01,410
that you had to participate
in a drill, right.

111
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:05,340
Where you were convened and
your teachers taught you

112
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,350
about how you need to go run in a closet

113
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,690
'cause there maybe a mass
shooter roaming the hallways

114
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:10,523
at your school.

115
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:16,050
And in our America that
should never have to happen.

116
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,448
Conversations take place--

117
00:04:17,448 --> 00:04:19,390
(audience applauds)

118
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,313
every night.

119
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,707
Conversations take place
every night between students

120
00:04:24,707 --> 00:04:25,580
and their parents.

121
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,933
Why do these things have to happen?

122
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,540
Why do we have to have a drill like that?

123
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,450
To which of course the response
is because there are people

124
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,990
in Washington DC supposed leaders.

125
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:38,120
Who have failed to have the courage

126
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,540
to reject a false choice.

127
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,160
Which suggests you're either in favor

128
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,290
of the Second Amendment

129
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,690
or you wanna take everyone's guns away.

130
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:49,400
Supposed leaders in
Washington DC who have failed

131
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,830
to have the courage to recognize.

132
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,040
You know what you wanna
go hunting that's fine.

133
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,310
But we need reasonable gun
safety laws in this country

134
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,270
starting with universal background checks

135
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,450
and a renewal of the assault weapon ban.

136
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:04,480
But they have failed to
have the courage to act

137
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,700
so Ben here's my response to you.

138
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,600
Upon being elected I will give
the United States Congress

139
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,400
100 days to get their act
together and have the courage

140
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,200
to pass reasonable gun safety laws.

141
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,410
And if they fail to do it, then
I will take executive action

142
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,770
and specifically what I will do

143
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,000
is put in place a requirement

144
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,390
that for anyone who sells
more than five guns a year

145
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,930
they are required to do background checks

146
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,940
when they sell those guns.

147
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:37,940
I will require that for any
gun dealer that breaks the law

148
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,380
the ATF take their license.

149
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:43,440
And by the way ATF, Alcohol
Tobacco and Firearms.

150
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,380
Well the ATF has being
a lot of the A and the T

151
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,750
but not much of the F
and we need to fix that.

152
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,583
And then--

153
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:52,464
(audience applauds)

154
00:05:56,868 --> 00:05:59,120
On the third piece cause
none of us have been sleeping

155
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,310
over the last two years.

156
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:03,370
Part of what has happened under
the current administration

157
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:08,370
is they took fugitives off
the list of prohibited people.

158
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,190
I'd put them back on the
list meaning that fugitives

159
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,209
from justice should not be
able to purchase a handgun,

160
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:16,060
or any kind of weapon.

161
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,640
So that's what I'd do.

162
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,473
- [Don] Will this be

163
00:06:18,473 --> 00:06:20,223
your first executive action as president?

164
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,373
- Well it depends on what else happens

165
00:06:23,373 --> 00:06:26,116
that'd be after 100 days.

166
00:06:26,116 --> 00:06:27,893
Let's see what happens
in the first 100 days.

167
00:06:27,893 --> 00:06:29,860
- All right, fair enough.

168
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,160
Angela Garrazzo is here
and she is a freshman

169
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,180
at Saint Anselm College studying
International Relations.

170
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,130
She is from New Hampshire, Angela.

171
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:41,680
- Good evening Senator my
question is as a college student

172
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,660
with over $25,000 of debt
in my first year alone.

173
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,580
What will you do to alleviate
the financial burdens

174
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,280
of the student debt crisis?

175
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,840
Do you support initiatives
such as free college,

176
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,080
loan protective legislation
or student repayment plans?

177
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,681
- Yeah Angela, and listen,
the students in New Hampshire

178
00:06:59,681 --> 00:07:02,630
are among the top five in the country

179
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,200
with student loan debt.

180
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:09,200
And it is absolutely unconscionable
that we have students

181
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,740
in America who are in absolute fear,

182
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,670
about the debt that they
will owe upon graduation.

183
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,030
And I have met and know so many students

184
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:22,060
who are making decisions
about their career

185
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,700
based on their fear that they may not

186
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,690
be able to pay their bills.

187
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,260
I know so many students who have graduated

188
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,540
who are making decisions

189
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,760
about whether or not to have a family.

190
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,250
Based on the burden of
their student loan debt

191
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,260
and being concerned about
whether they're gonna actually

192
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,240
be able to get through the month.

193
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,820
We cannot afford to
have a system like this

194
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,270
especially for young people who have made

195
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:47,100
an investment of their
time and their resources.

196
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,270
Because they actually want an education

197
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,810
to live a productive life

198
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,740
and contribute to our
society and be leaders.

199
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,170
So here's what I'd do specifically

200
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:56,616
I do support debt-free college.

201
00:07:56,616 --> 00:08:00,800
I also believe that what we
need to do is we need to allow

202
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,470
students to refinance
your student loan debt.

203
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,970
And in particular I am supporting
an initiative that would

204
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:08,210
allow you to refinance
your student loan debt

205
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,730
such that it would be on par

206
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,930
with the federal lending amounts.

207
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:14,900
So for example if you,
probably none of you here,

208
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,780
but any of your older
brothers and sisters.

209
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,450
If you took out student loans
between the years of about

210
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:24,282
2006 through 2013 the
interest rate was about 7%.

211
00:08:24,282 --> 00:08:26,520
What I am proposing is
regardless of the interest rate

212
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,810
at the time that you took
out your student loans,

213
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:31,713
that upon repayment it
would have to be at 3.5%.

214
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,330
The other thing is this, part of the issue

215
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,830
is in terms of repayment.

216
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:40,910
There is no connection between
what you owe and your income.

217
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,650
So what I would be requiring
is that there would be

218
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:47,210
a robust process by which
income-based repayment

219
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:49,070
would be the norm.

220
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,370
And finally, let's look at
the fact that for all of you

221
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:56,000
and all of anybody who has
applied for financial aid.

222
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,510
That is an awful process.

223
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,920
You guys know what I'm
talking about all those pages

224
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,690
you can barely get through that form.

225
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:06,472
(audience applauds)

226
00:09:06,472 --> 00:09:10,530
And so part of what we need to
do is simplify that process.

227
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:13,160
But we have got to do a
better job in this country

228
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,750
because I look at something
like for example teachers.

229
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,910
I've been spending a lot of time.

230
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:20,180
I think a lot about education in terms of

231
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,430
every aspect of it from student loans,

232
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:25,890
to what we need to do to pay
our teachers their value.

233
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,950
And the number of teachers

234
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:32,180
who have left the profession of teaching,

235
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,936
'cause they can't afford to
pay off their student loans.

236
00:09:34,936 --> 00:09:39,200
Right now we're looking at
actually a deficit of teachers

237
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,230
based on the number of students
that we need to actually

238
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:44,090
teach and the few teachers we
have especially rural areas.

239
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,320
So it's a big issue and it
crosses a lot of subjects.

240
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,840
- Well let me jump in
here because if students,

241
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,320
I mean teachers can pay their loans.

242
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,841
Elizabeth Warren is here as you know.

243
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:54,180
She said that she supports
student loan forgiveness

244
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,686
for 42 million Americans.

245
00:09:55,686 --> 00:09:56,519
- Yeah.

246
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:57,373
- Would you go that far,
do you support that?

247
00:09:57,373 --> 00:10:00,390
- Well I support anything that
is about reducing the debt

248
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,315
of student loans and I think

249
00:10:01,315 --> 00:10:03,010
that's an important conversation to have.

250
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,510
- Okay fair enough.

251
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:07,889
Let's move on now, Ryan Wilson
is here, Ryan is a sophomore

252
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:11,210
at Harvard studying
Neuroscience in California

253
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:16,130
and a supporter of Julian Castro, Ryan.

254
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,790
- Hi, good evening Senator Harris.

255
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,610
My name is Ryan and I'm
a constituent of yours

256
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,370
from Orange country California.

257
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,740
In a January town hall, when
asked about your approach

258
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,700
to universal health care,

259
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,644
you acknowledged that you'd support

260
00:10:26,644 --> 00:10:28,980
eliminating private insurers in favor

261
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,190
of a single payer health
insurance program.

262
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,940
How do you respond to the 74% of Americans

263
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,900
who wish to have the option to
keep their private insurers?

264
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:40,300
- Well I support Medicare for all

265
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,040
and I support it for a number of reasons.

266
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,580
That include the fact that
there are a lot of people

267
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,520
in our country who simply do
not have access to healthcare

268
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,720
'cause they cannot afford it.

269
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,900
And that's unconscionable

270
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,990
and I actually believe it's a moral issue.

271
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,710
And it is a sign of weather or not

272
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,830
we are gonna be a civil society

273
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:59,700
to determine are people gonna
have access to healthcare

274
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,320
simply because they can afford it.

275
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,580
When in fact that should be
a right and not a privilege

276
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,950
of the few who can afford it.

277
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:08,320
That is the value with which
I bring to this discussion.

278
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,920
I will also say this on the
issue of this whole dynamic

279
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,600
about access to private insurance.

280
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,850
Yeah of course private insurance

281
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,880
you can get supplemental
insurance and all that.

282
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,010
But let's not be duped
by a messaging campaign

283
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:26,010
that has been waged for years
by the insurance companies.

284
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,980
To have you into believing
that you need to defend them,

285
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,360
you need to defend yourself.

286
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,360
You know what 91% of the
doctors are in Medicare.

287
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,980
So the idea and the suggestion
they're trying to make to you

288
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,540
is really a false one.

289
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:45,100
You will be able to have your doctor.

290
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,920
91% of them are in the Medicare system.

291
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,013
And I'll tell you another thing
and it's a personal story.

292
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:57,240
My mother who, my mother
was all of five feet tall,

293
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,073
if you ever met her

294
00:11:58,073 --> 00:11:59,290
you would thought she was seven feet tall.

295
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,820
She was an incredible woman.

296
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,620
She had two goals in her life.

297
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,450
She was a breast cancer researcher.

298
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:05,810
Her goal was to end breast cancer

299
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,580
and raise her two daughters.

300
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,820
Well she got cancer

301
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,410
and she ultimately
passed away from cancer.

302
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:16,100
But if you have ever had
the unfortunate experience

303
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,800
of going through the healthcare system

304
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,780
with someone who has an acute illness.

305
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,180
I'm gonna tell you what that is.

306
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:26,260
It is having a doctor say to you

307
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:29,883
have you heard of the
term anticipatory grief.

308
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,620
Which you hadn't heard before

309
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,020
but when you hear it
it makes perfect sense.

310
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,370
Which means you're
starting already to grieve

311
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,453
the loss of someone that is still around.

312
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,450
You have the experience of
going in and out of hospitals

313
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:46,860
helping someone who is frail
and weak in and out of cars

314
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,930
to get into a hospital.

315
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:50,168
You look at medical charts
and sometimes the medicine

316
00:12:50,168 --> 00:12:52,320
jives sometimes it doesn't.

317
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,320
Sometimes people are paying attention to

318
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,710
this is the medication
that causes drowsiness.

319
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:59,610
They don't want, or pain
that they can't bear.

320
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:02,060
You go through the
process of worrying about

321
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:05,037
is there something I can
cook that will make you

322
00:13:05,037 --> 00:13:07,253
be able to eat and hold down.

323
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,680
You go through the process of
being concerned that somebody

324
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,560
who is on chemotherapy are there clothes.

325
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,270
Can I get you something that's
soft enough that you can wear

326
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,983
that will not irritate your skin.

327
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:20,623
Now thankfully our mother had Medicare,

328
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,850
but for people who are
going through this process,

329
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,943
which they are every day in America.

330
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:29,890
For them to also have to be
concerned about how they're

331
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:33,543
going to pay that bill is unconscionable.

332
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,920
And that's how I feel about this subject.

333
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:41,920
Cost should not be the
barrier to receiving the care

334
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,490
that will relieve you of pain

335
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,870
or help improve your quality of life.

336
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:51,400
And we've got to get this
right that's how I feel.

337
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,390
- So you mentioned the insurance
companies you don't feel

338
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,170
like you have to defend
the insurance companies?

339
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,003
- No I don't have to.

340
00:13:57,003 --> 00:14:00,770
- So the bill that you
co-sponsored it would effectively

341
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,350
eliminate private insurance.

342
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,530
Is there room for private insurance in a?

343
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:05,650
- No, of course there is,

344
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,740
for supplemental insurance absolutely.

345
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,760
- For companies, for
private insurance companies,

346
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,290
there's room in your
administration for that.

347
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,123
- Yeah.

348
00:14:12,123 --> 00:14:13,670
- Okay, but listen in this bill.

349
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,930
- But Don I think that it's
really important to talk

350
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:16,970
about the goal.

351
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:20,080
Right, I mean we can talk
about the intermediate steps.

352
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,480
But the goal has to be
and we all have to agree

353
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,380
access to healthcare is a right

354
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,830
and should be thought of as a right

355
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,910
and pubic policy should create it.

356
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,810
Such that it is a real
right and not a privilege

357
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:33,880
for those who can afford it.

358
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,040
And it's one of the
biggest issues impacting

359
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,740
American families right now.

360
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,560
I'm traveling this country
it's one of the biggest issues.

361
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,560
The number of people who
sit down and make decisions

362
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,700
about whether they're gonna
have access to healthcare

363
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,430
or not based on money, you would shocked.

364
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:51,100
One out of four diabetes
patients in our country

365
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,410
cannot afford their insulin.

366
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:56,290
There is a drug that helps save a life

367
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:59,390
if there have been an overdose of opioids.

368
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:04,390
And that drug can cost up
$4,000, that's unconscionable.

369
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:09,180
- Listen but to be clear this
bill that you co-sponsored

370
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,240
essentially phases out private insurance

371
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,130
for four years, in four years.

372
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,580
- I don't think that's right.

373
00:15:16,469 --> 00:15:17,390
- That's what the studies show

374
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,223
that it would phase out private insurance.

375
00:15:18,223 --> 00:15:19,871
- Which bill, I'm actually supporting?

376
00:15:19,871 --> 00:15:21,240
- The bill that you co-sponsored.

377
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,073
- Medicare for all?

378
00:15:22,073 --> 00:15:23,680
- Yes, would co-sponsored
with Bernie Sanders,

379
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,030
Medicare for all would effectively

380
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,330
eliminate private insurance.

381
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:29,421
It would essentially phase out
private insurance companies.

382
00:15:29,421 --> 00:15:32,000
- As the main source but there
would still be supplemental.

383
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,786
There'd still be access
to supplemental insurance

384
00:15:33,786 --> 00:15:34,619
- Okay, all right.

385
00:15:34,619 --> 00:15:36,910
- For whatever is not covered
but let's be clear about it.

386
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:39,550
Medicare for all under the
plan that I am supporting

387
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,970
will extend coverage.

388
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:43,500
So whereas right now it
does not cover dental,

389
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,570
vision, hearing aids.

390
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:49,740
Under the plan, Medicare for
all it will cover those needs

391
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,010
will be covered, there
will an extension of it.

392
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:54,320
Including mental health
services, including what we need

393
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,740
to do better around women
having greater access

394
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,840
to reproductive health care.

395
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,715
- All right, now the Green New Deal.

396
00:15:59,715 --> 00:16:00,548
(audience applauds)

397
00:16:00,548 --> 00:16:01,381
- Yes.

398
00:16:01,381 --> 00:16:03,060
- The Green New Deal,
everyone wants to hear,

399
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,050
wants to know about that.

400
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,270
Max Ratner is originally
from Massachusetts.

401
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,790
He is now a student at Saint
Anselm College right here.

402
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:11,210
Last summer he interned
for Senator Ed Markey.

403
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,700
Max what's your question?

404
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,113
- Senator Harris thank you
for taking my question.

405
00:16:14,113 --> 00:16:14,946
- Thank you Max.

406
00:16:14,946 --> 00:16:17,620
- The Green New Deal is not
a law but rather a memorandum

407
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,880
that has no actual legislative effect.

408
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,930
It's been characterized as
expensive, divides democrats

409
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,840
and has no chance of
passing through congress

410
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,950
in it's current state.

411
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,640
Why do you support it?

412
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:32,300
- I support it because I to my core know

413
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,350
that the climate crisis is representing

414
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:37,580
an existential threat to
who we are as human beings.

415
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,430
We have had supposed leaders
who are buying science

416
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:43,270
and pushing science fiction
instead of science fact.

417
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:46,280
And this is to our collective
peril if we don't take

418
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,410
this matter seriously
with a sense of urgency.

419
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:52,210
Why I support the Green New
Deal is because it does that.

420
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:56,290
It puts timelines in effect,
it appreciates that we need

421
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:58,964
to take this seriously
and the clock is ticking

422
00:16:58,964 --> 00:17:02,150
every day on this issue.

423
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:04,410
And every day we fail to act,

424
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:06,380
will be to our collective consequence.

425
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,480
The UN has already said
over the next 12 years

426
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,480
if we don't get this straight

427
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,550
there will be severe consequence.

428
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:17,380
And this is within our ability
to do something about it.

429
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,600
Listen, families are impacted by this.

430
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,331
You know children, seniors we
all need to drink clean air,

431
00:17:23,331 --> 00:17:25,860
drink clean water and breathe clean air.

432
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,605
And you know don't drink the air.

433
00:17:27,605 --> 00:17:29,688
(laughs)

434
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,710
You look at farmers,

435
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:34,690
farmers are impacted
by this climate change.

436
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:37,020
You can look at fire
fighters in California

437
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,760
who are impacted by climate change.

438
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,290
Across the board people
are being impacted by this.

439
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:46,050
Let's also look at the fact
that we have in so many states

440
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,450
great work that is happening.

441
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,610
That is actually
contributing to the economy

442
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,330
around an investment
in renewable energies.

443
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:54,790
The bureau of labor statistics
came out with a list

444
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:57,040
last year of the top 20 jobs

445
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,610
that are gonna see the
greatest amount of growth

446
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,480
in our country over the next 10 years.

447
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,280
Number one and number two,
installation and maintenance

448
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,690
of wind turbines and solar paneling.

449
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:08,040
Let's look at it in the
context of what we know

450
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,350
to be true about water.

451
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:15,010
Water is a precious and
diminishing resource on our planet.

452
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,440
When you look at what's happening

453
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,224
around shifting populations
around the globe,

454
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:23,690
climate change is one of the main factors

455
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,670
in what is happening.

456
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,930
There was a time and still to this day

457
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:29,770
where we're fighting wars over oil.

458
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,590
In a short matter of time guys,

459
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,913
we're gonna be fighting wars over water.

460
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:37,610
Part of what we can do with
the Green New Deal is have

461
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:39,260
a sense of urgency on all these matters.

462
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:42,740
Including the precious nature of water

463
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,320
and what we need to do to
be smarter on public policy.

464
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,470
I think that for example
that we need to have really

465
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:49,760
diversify public policy on water.

466
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,420
With an equal emphasis on
recycling, on conservation,

467
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:55,853
on capture of water, storage
of water, desalination.

468
00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:00,550
We need to invest in electric cars.

469
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:03,790
We need to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions.

470
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,650
All of that is in the Green New Deal.

471
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,640
And you know the greatest thing about it

472
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,350
that I'm really enjoying.

473
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:12,100
It it causing these
conversations to happen

474
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,290
around our country in a way

475
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:16,000
they've not been in the last few years.

476
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,280
And hopefully everyone is understanding

477
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,760
that so much of the harm
we are doing to our planet

478
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,850
is caused by us as human beings.

479
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:29,660
And the solutions will be
because we change our behaviors

480
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:33,530
without much requirement
of change to lifestyle.

481
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:37,150
And it will be urgent in terms
of the work we need to do

482
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:40,040
and the approach we need to
have, but we can see success.

483
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,240
We've seen it in California.

484
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,830
In California we made a decision

485
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,750
that we would go back
to the 1990s standards

486
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,550
in terms of emissions by the year 2020

487
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:53,210
and we've already met those goals.

488
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:57,450
This can happen, we can do it
but there has to be leadership

489
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,710
in our country and that
is one of the main reasons

490
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:01,670
we need a new president
of the United States.

491
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:04,070
- All right, so speaking of air and water

492
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,296
why don't we take a a breather.

493
00:20:05,296 --> 00:20:06,129
- Okay.

494
00:20:06,129 --> 00:20:07,303

501

Oh I love it, it's a great razor.

504
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,220
It has that fence in the middle,

505
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:38,030
it gives a nice smooth shave
just stopping that irritation

506
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,393
that burn that I get.

507
00:20:39,393 --> 00:20:41,737

And right now we are talking

591
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,939
with California Senator Kamala Harris.

592
00:24:21,939 --> 00:24:22,929
- Good to be with you Don.

593

- It's good to have you here.

594
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:26,670
I wanna bring in now Vanessa

00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,650
- Hello Senator Harris how are you?

599
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:33,483
- How are you doing?

600
00:24:33,483 --> 00:24:34,800
I was just in New Orleans actually.

601
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,258
- Oh wow! (laughs)

602
00:24:36,258 --> 00:24:41,258
So my question talks
about how this country

603
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,270
plans to administer reparations

604
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:46,690
to the descendant of former slaves.

605
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:48,530
It's been discussed heavily,

606
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:51,220
Georgetown just voted to devote

607
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,770
a portion their students' tuition

608
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:58,030
to administer reparations
to the descendants

609
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,810
of the 272 slaves

610
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:03,500
who were sold in the 19th
century to save the school.

611
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,439
However this is but a small step.

612
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:11,140
What actions, what specific
actions do you plan to take

613
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:14,670
to administer reparations
for this unpaid labor.

614
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:19,050
- Right, so I'm actually
supporting a bill.

615
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,670
There's a congresswoman by
the name of Sheila Jackson Lee

616
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:24,410
that has written this
Bill out of the House.

617
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:26,520
Which I'm supporting to study

618
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,220
exactly which should be the
response to your question.

619
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:32,160
But to your point and
to support your point.

620
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:37,160
Look, we had centuries of
slavery in this country.

621
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:42,750
We had decades of Jim Crow.

622
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:47,240
We had legalized
discrimination and segregation

623
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:52,240
and then we had defacto
discrimination and segregation.

624
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:57,310
And to believe or suggest
that those years of treatment

625
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:04,120
and abuse and violence and crimes

626
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:09,120
did not have an impact is to
overlook the facts of history.

627
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:11,860
And for that reason I
support the legislation

628
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,810
and what we need to do

629
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:15,100
to think about specifically what it means

630
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,890
in terms of the next steps.

631
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:18,249
But I thank you for that question.

632
00:26:18,249 --> 00:26:20,780
- Senator yes or no do you
support financial reparations?

633
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,360
- I support that we study them.

634
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,430
We should study and see

635
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:25,938
but look let's look at this for example.

636
00:26:25,938 --> 00:26:30,938
One of the issues that is
very clear is that trauma,

637
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:35,160
years of trauma or even
one experience with trauma,

638
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,790
can lead to lifelong consequences.

639
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,910
I'm supporting some work
and was part of some work

640
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:41,550
that had started years ago

641
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:44,440
of looking at children who
are growing up in a community

642
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,000
where there is violence.

643
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,420
And if you look at the associated then

644
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,720
physical health effects
that are associated

645
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,480
with exposure to trauma.

646
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,127
And what that can mean in
terms of physical disability

647
00:26:55,127 --> 00:26:58,650
not to mention what it
means in terms of a child's

648
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,630
ability to learn and be educated.

649
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:04,260
There are real factors that
can be associated with trauma.

650
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,950
And were you were talking
about the years and years

651
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:09,840
and years of trauma that were experienced

652
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,460
because of slavery because of Jim Crow.

653
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,440
And because of all that
we have seen in terms of

654
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:18,080
institutional and legal
discrimination and racism.

655
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,110
This is very real and it needs to studied

656
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:22,720
and we need to look at
exactly how the response

657
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,998
should be played out and
how it should be worked.

658
00:27:24,998 --> 00:27:27,287
- I don't need to tell you
that a big voting block

659
00:27:27,287 --> 00:27:29,550
in the Democratic Party, black Americans.

660
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,383
- Yes.

661
00:27:30,383 --> 00:27:32,010
- What's your agenda for black America?

662
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:34,370
- Well it's a number of things
first of all we need to deal

663
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:37,648
with the economic status
of African Americans

664
00:27:37,648 --> 00:27:38,690
in this country.

665
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,400
When you look at it in terms of everything

666
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:45,400
from home ownership to wages
we can see huge disparities.

667
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,330
And so that needs to be addressed.

668
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,930
Let's look at an issue
like maternal mortality.

669
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:53,240
I am actually presenting what I believe

670
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,011
should be the response to that.

671
00:27:55,011 --> 00:27:57,030
I have studied this issue.

672
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:59,910
Black women are three to
four times more likely to die

673
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,430
in connection with child birth.

674
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:04,369
And when you study the
issue it becomes very clear

675
00:28:04,369 --> 00:28:07,650
that it is regardless of
the socio economic status

676
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:08,710
of those women.

677
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:11,460
It is regardless of
their educational level.

678
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:15,320
It is as it turns out without
much more investigation

679
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,740
a matter of racial bias in the
health care delivery system.

680
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:22,060
Those women are not taken as
seriously when they show up

681
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,750
at the clinic or the doctor's
office or the hospital.

682
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:27,510
I am looking at it in terms
of being a proud member

683
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:30,260
and graduate of an
HBCU, Howard University.

684
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,700
And what we need to do
to support our HBCUs.

685
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,190
I was proud that we actually,
I had a piece of legislation

686
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,620
that actually has been passed.

687
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:41,360
To invest federal resources
and supporting our HBCUs

688
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:46,140
recognizing that HBCUs really
produce in some professions,

689
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,440
the majority of African Americans

690
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,810
who enter those professions.

691
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,940
So there are a number of
issues and including of course

692
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,260
what we need to do to reform
the criminal justice system.

693
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:56,680
- Okay, this is a, I've
done a number of town halls.

694
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,520
This is a fascinating question
I think that you'll find.

695
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,330
It's coming from Diana Ding
she's a junior at Harvard

696
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:04,223
studying computer science
from San Francisco, Diana.

697
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:07,310
- Hi Senator, thank you
for taking my question.

698
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,540
- Thank you.

699
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,090
- You have told The Root that you support

700
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:12,050
legalizing sex work.

701
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:14,830
How will you ensure that sex
workers are doing this work

702
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:18,130
because they want to and
not because they have

703
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:20,270
no opportunity to do other work?

704
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,330
Given that sex workers

705
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:23,410
often come from marginalized communities.

706
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:25,940
- No that's right, so what I don't support

707
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,712
is criminalizing these women.

708
00:29:28,712 --> 00:29:33,220
So my background as you
know is I was a prosecutor.

709
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,830
When I was district
attorney of San Francisco

710
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,790
I instituted a number of policies

711
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:40,230
that were focused on women and children

712
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:42,570
and how they were
treated frankly with bias

713
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:44,280
in the criminal justice system.

714
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,160
Where they were criminalized

715
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,380
without really looking
at the real offender

716
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:51,300
and so and often that case
was the pimps and the johns.

717
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:54,080
But instead the women were
being arrested as prostitutes.

718
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,010
And so I created policies
that were about saying

719
00:29:57,010 --> 00:30:00,200
that we really need to
focus on the other folks

720
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,790
and not just on the women.

721
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:05,260
I was responsible for an
initiative in San Francisco

722
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,060
that was about recognizing

723
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:09,846
that girls who are being trafficked

724
00:30:09,846 --> 00:30:13,060
were being called teenage prostitutes.

725
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,630
When in fact they were the victims

726
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:19,610
of an incredible amount of
abuse and had been trafficked.

727
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:22,990
And so I created a whole
policy in San Francisco

728
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,170
that was one intended

729
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:26,930
to stop calling them teenage prostitutes.

730
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:29,480
But instead to call them
sexually exploited youth

731
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,750
and because of the work that we did,

732
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:35,110
we then created a safe
house for these young women.

733
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:36,810
So then instead of them being arrested

734
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:39,590
and put in juvenile hall they
would be in a safe house.

735
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:40,900
And then we were responsible

736
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,980
for actually getting legislation passed

737
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:46,470
that said that when those
johns and pimps are prosecuted

738
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:49,475
they should be prosecuted in connection

739
00:30:49,475 --> 00:30:52,010
with the sale of a child.

740
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:54,190
Again looking at what need to do

741
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:56,020
to figure out who's doing what.

742
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,100
As it relates to women
who are being trafficked

743
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:02,840
I was one of the leaders in
the country with many others

744
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:07,020
in saying that Backpage needed
to be put out of business.

745
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:10,530
Because they were in the
business of basically allowing

746
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:13,220
the trafficking in particular
of underaged girls.

747
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:16,890
So this something that I have
had a lifelong experience with

748
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:19,660
including what we need to
go after those who traffic

749
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,350
girls and women and boys.

750
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:23,530
We should also be clear about that.

751
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:26,980
And I take it very seriously
but we should not be

752
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:30,020
criminalizing women who are engaged

753
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:33,850
in consensual opportunities
for employment.

754
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,580
But we should definitely
be careful and be sure

755
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:40,167
that they are not being
trafficked or abused in any way.

756
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:41,470
(audience applauds)

757
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:44,100
- Our next question Senator
comes from Margaret McSherry.

758
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,525
Margaret is a junior at Saint
Anselm College right here

759
00:31:46,525 --> 00:31:48,640
studying polices and she's originally

760
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,300
from Massachusetts, Margaret.

761
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,670
- Hello Senator, a question for you.

762
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:54,450
As tensions grow between the United States

763
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:56,000
and nations like Russia and North Korea,

764
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,620
what should be done to prepare the nation

765
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,593
for the possibility of cyber warfare?

766
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:01,950
- Oh that's a great question Margaret

767
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:03,850
I'm so glad you asked it.

768
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:07,940
'Cause it's really, it's been changeling.

769
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:10,390
I've been talking about it
in the United States Senate.

770
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:12,560
I serve on the Senate
Homeland Security Committee.

771
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,200
I serve on the Senate
Intelligence Committee.

772
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,167
You know newsflash Russia
interfered in the election

773
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:18,839
of the president of The United States.

774
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:20,150
(audience applauds)

775
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:24,370
And in fact on that point
about cyber security.

776
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:25,523
One, it is real.

777
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:29,840
When we talk about national
security to your point

778
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,903
a new form of war.

779
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:37,870
We should understand will be
cyber attacks and cyber attacks

780
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,950
can take a number of forms.

781
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:42,640
But usually to our
critical infrastructure.

782
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,760
So we've already seen one,

783
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,780
'cause you know what, under
the previous administration

784
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:50,020
our election system was designated

785
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:53,610
as critical infrastructure, right.

786
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:55,670
So we already know that
we have been have attacked

787
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:57,835
in terms of our elections.

788
00:32:57,835 --> 00:33:00,560
We should also understand
that we are vulnerable

789
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,780
in terms of our electrical grids.

790
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,570
We are vulnerable in terms
of all of the systems

791
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:08,160
that hold together our financial systems.

792
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,780
That hold together our
medical care systems

793
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:14,170
and we have got to pay greater attention.

794
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:17,323
I have a bill that is a bi-partisan bill.

795
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:23,000
That is designed to strengthen
states' election systems

796
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
to prevent the next attack,
it's a bipartisan bill.

797
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:32,010
And the leader in the United States Senate

798
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,650
will not put in on the floor for a vote.

799
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,900
And this will be to our
collective peril when people

800
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,440
play politics with an issue
that is truly about our

801
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,040
vulnerability as a country.

802
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,020
I worked on this issue when
I was attorney general.

803
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,300
I was attorney general of
California for two terms.

804
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:48,513
And a lot of work that we did
there was about making sure

805
00:33:48,513 --> 00:33:52,050
that we were focused on the
vulnerabilities that we have

806
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:55,020
because of technology and doing
what we can to protect it.

807
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,290
As the president of the
United States I will tell you

808
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:59,710
that will be one of my number one issues.

809
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:02,520
Because as far as I think
about it we're used to

810
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,150
and we prepare for war,

811
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:06,340
because we should and we should make sure

812
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,710
that we're ready in the event of.

813
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,750
Well this will be a war without blood

814
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:16,020
and we are not prepared and we must be.

815
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,330
But we cannot be in denial

816
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:18,650
and this president of the United States

817
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:20,693
is in utter denial about the realities.

818
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:24,100
- From the vulnerabilities
of our cyber system

819
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,680
to the vulnerabilities now of children.

820
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,340
Something I know that is important to you.

821
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,880
I wanna bring in Nicole Senders.

822
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,460
She's a student at Harvard
Graduate School of Education,

823
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:34,000
originally from Oregon and is a supporter

824
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,387
of Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Nicole.

825
00:34:36,387 --> 00:34:38,030
- Hi Nicole (laughs).

826
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:40,320
- Thank you for being here tonight.

827
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,500
You recently mentioned your regret

828
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,170
of the California Truancy
Law that arrested parents

829
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:45,930
for frequently absent children.

830
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:48,690
Are there any other laws
or policies that you regret

831
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:51,520
as a prosecutor and what
actions if any would you take

832
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,450
to remedy this as president.

833
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:57,400
- So let me be clear, I absolutely believe

834
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,030
that children have and
should be thought of

835
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:04,070
to have a constitutional
right to an education.

836
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:08,830
And, period, so the truancy initiative

837
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:12,840
that you're referring to was
started by me when I was DA.

838
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,680
Because I took a look at who
the homicide victims were

839
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,443
who are under the age of 25.

840
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,100
People were just used to
these young men being killed

841
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,640
and I said wait a minute
instead of just responding

842
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,060
when they are killed with putting
more police on the streets

843
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,440
or having gang enforcement strategies.

844
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,370
Why aren't we asking the
question, who are they?

845
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:37,140
So I asked that question
who are these young men

846
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,370
who are under the age of 25
when they are being killed?

847
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:42,250
And I quickly learned that 94% of them

848
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,693
were high school dropouts.

849
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:47,410
I then looked closer into the issue

850
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:49,510
and learned of the chronically

851
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:52,090
and habitually truant students.

852
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:55,650
Up to 40% of them were
elementary school students

853
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:59,453
missing 50, 60 up to 80
days of 180 day school year.

854
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:04,630
So I decided to take the
issue on and I took the issue

855
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:05,850
on for a number of reasons.

856
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:07,990
One, understanding an
elementary school truant

857
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:11,450
is three to four times likely
to be a high school dropout.

858
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:13,660
70% of the prisoners in the United States

859
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,120
are high school dropouts.

860
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,760
An African American man who
was high school dropout between

861
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,430
the age of 20 and 24 is two
thirds likely to be in jail

862
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:22,730
have been in jail or dead.

863
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:27,410
So I took the issue on and I
said what we have got to do

864
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:29,860
is pay attention to the
fact that these children

865
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:30,693
aren't in school

866
00:36:30,693 --> 00:36:35,590
and put all the resources
necessary to get them in school.

867
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:37,440
And give their parent the resources,

868
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,380
hold the school districts accountable.

869
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,730
Why aren't the school
districts raising the alarm

870
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:43,470
and putting all the resources possible

871
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,560
and to getting these
kids to school everyday.

872
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,990
And as a result of our initiative,

873
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:49,723
first of all nobody went to jail.

874
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:53,800
And as a result of our
initiative we improved attendance

875
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:58,800
by over 30% and to put
a fine point on this.

876
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:03,300
When we look at the issue of
education in our children.

877
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:08,160
No child should be overlooked

878
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,250
and this is what the system does guys.

879
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:14,830
For certain kids the system
really doesn't expect much

880
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:18,773
from them, that is a harsh
reality in many places.

881
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,780
And so when they're not
showing up in school

882
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,193
the system is just keeps moving.

883
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,730
And I said this is wrong,

884
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:29,100
let's put a spotlight on this issue.

885
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,240
And let's deal with it
because these children

886
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:34,480
have a capacity equal to any child

887
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,060
in any other school district.

888
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,090
And you can best believe the community

889
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:39,603
where I was talking about.

890
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:43,490
A large part of those
communities had an annual income,

891
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:45,910
household income of about $15,000.

892
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:48,716
You think if the children
in those school districts

893
00:37:48,716 --> 00:37:53,140
that had a annual income
of 150 or $300,000.

894
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,870
You think the alarms
would not have been raised

895
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:59,330
if those children hadn't been
attending school everyday.

896
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:02,530
Much less missing up to 80
days of 180 day school year.

897
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,130
That's why I took that issue on.

898
00:38:05,315 --> 00:38:06,694
(audience applauds)

899
00:38:06,694 --> 00:38:08,000
- Another issue that I
wanna talk to you about

900
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,750
which is really important.

901
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,410
I'm not sure if you were watching earlier

902
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:12,570
but Senator Bernie Sanders

903
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:15,080
said that he in favor of felons

904
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,780
being able to vote
while serving in prison.

905
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:19,910
He was asked specifically about people

906
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:21,830
like the Boston Marathon bomber.

907
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:23,960
Also people who were
convicted of sexual assault

908
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,177
and he said this is a quote.

909
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:27,957
"The right vote is
inherent to our democracy,

910
00:38:27,957 --> 00:38:30,090
"yes, even for terrible people."

911
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:31,530
Do you agree with that Senator?

912
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:33,410
- I agree that the right to vote

913
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:37,930
is one of the very important
components of citizenship.

914
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:40,296
And it is something that people

915
00:38:40,296 --> 00:38:44,430
should not be stripped needlessly.

916
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:47,600
Which is why I have been long an advocate

917
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,240
of making sure that the
formerly incarcerated

918
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,610
are not denied a right to vote.

919
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:54,370
Which is the case in so
many states in our country.

920
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:57,850
In some states, permanently
deprived of the right to vote

921
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:01,050
and these are policies
that go back to Jim Crow.

922
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:04,700
These are policies that go
back to the heart of policies

923
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,440
that have been about disenfranchisement.

924
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,770
Policies that continue until today

925
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:10,033
and we need to take it seriously.

926
00:39:10,033 --> 00:39:13,620
- But the people who are
convicted, in prison,

927
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:16,010
like the Boston Marathon
bomber on death row.

928
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:18,000
People who are convicted of sexual assault

929
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,470
they should be able to vote?

930
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:21,303
- I think we should
have that conversation.

931
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:25,600
- Okay, all right, thank you.

932
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,030
We're gonna have more
with Senator Kamala Harris

933
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:28,070
from the special Democratic,

934
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:30,970
this special CNN Democratic
presidential town hall event

935
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:32,620
right here after this break.

936
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,665
Don't go anywhere.

937
00:39:33,665 --> 00:39:36,665
(audience applauds)

938
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:39,603
- Who knew.

939
00:39:39,603 --> 00:39:41,746
- Yeah, so you're with the UPS store.

940
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:44,430
- Yes, in fact we
printed these right here.

941
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:45,890
- Oh I thought you guys just did shipping.

942
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:49,940
- No we do printing, packing,
faxing, notarizing, shredding,

943
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:52,420
mail-boxing, copying, taping, binding.

944
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,253
- Uh huh.

945
00:39:53,253 --> 00:39:55,680
- Consulting, designing,
returning, storing, creating

946
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,913
oh and of course shipping.

947
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:00,970
- So you're into shipping?

948
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,170
- We also do printing, packing, faxing.

949
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:06,270
- [Narrator] Come into the
UPS store today for every ing

950
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:08,670
your small business need
and of course shipping.

951
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:12,610

how does our identity

- That's a great question.

1046
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:11,740
Well you know there is something
that I feel very strongly

1047
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:13,480
about this moment in time.

1048
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:16,110
I think of this as being
an inflection point

1049
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:17,850
in the history of our country.

1050
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:22,230
I think this is a moment in
time for a variety of reasons.

1051
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:25,420
That is requiring us
all to look in mirror,

1052
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:26,790
each one of us and collectively,

1053
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:29,380
look in a mirror, and ask a question.

1054
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:31,653
That question being who are we.

1055
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:35,310
And I believe part of the
answer to that question

1056
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:37,513
is we are better than this.

1057
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,380
The other part of it is understanding that

1058
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,590
in this inflection moment

1059
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:47,330
there are very powerful voices
in our country right now

1060
00:44:47,330 --> 00:44:49,830
that are trying to sow
hate and division among us.

1061
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:56,050
And we need to speak many
truths and one of them is this.

1062
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:59,800
The vast majority of us
have so much more in common

1063
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:04,800
than what separates us and
I know that to be true.

1064
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,730
I know it to be true
because I have been exposed

1065
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:12,439
to many cultures, right, you got me.

(audience laughs)

1067
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:18,320
Right there you go so I
know it to be true based on

1068
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:21,250
what I call the middle
of the night thought.

1069
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:23,980
Some people call it three
in the morning thought

1070
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:26,320
other people call it the witching hour.

1071

been weighing on you.

1074
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:36,190
For the vast majority of us
when we wake up in the middle

1075

of the night thinking that thought.

1076
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,730
It is never through the lens of the party

1077
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:42,530
with which we're registered to vote.

1078
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,380
For the vast majority
of us when we wake up

1079
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:46,580
thinking that thought,

1080
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:49,460
it is never through the
lens of some simplistic

1081
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:51,693
demographic a pollster put us in.

1082
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,950
And for the vast majority
of us when we wake up

1083
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:58,050
thinking that thought it
usually has to do with

1084
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:00,530
one of just a very few things.

1085
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:02,980
Our personal health, the
health of our children,

1086
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:04,630
or our parents.

1087
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:07,180
For so many Americans can
I get a job, keep a job,

1088
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:10,410

the month, retire with dignity.

1089
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:13,750
For our students can I pay
off those student loans.

1090
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:15,230
For so many family members in America

1091
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:18,283
can I help my family member
get off their opioid addiction?

1092
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:22,601
The vast majority of us
have so much more in common

1093
00:46:22,601 --> 00:46:24,930
than what separates us.

1094
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:28,520
And while there are these
powerful forces that are trying

1095
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:31,190
to sow hate and division
among us and have us pointing

1096
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:34,740
fingers at each other and
oh you're that and I'm this.

1097
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:38,200
I say I'm not buying it, I'm not buying it

1098
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:43,070
and that's how I think
about my experiences.

1099
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:48,070
I know how much we have in

00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,523
well on both sides there is merit.

1107
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:13,610
We need leadership in this
country who has through personal

1108
00:47:13,610 --> 00:47:18,610
experience and through
ideals and through just

1109
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,090
an ability to see who
people are and speak truth.

1110
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:25,990
We need leadership that
understands the vast majority of us

1111
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:28,220
have so much more in common
than what separates us.

1112
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,200
And they've gotta stop diving us

1113
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,920
and that's why I'm running for president,

1114
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,360
that's one of the reasons.

1115
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,730
- Let's talk about--
(audience applauds)

1116
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:37,790
Let's talk about the vision

1117
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:39,780
and I think this falls into that category.

1118
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:41,810
Because you have said,
recently said, that it would be

1119
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:44,480
a trap, it would be a mistake
for democrats to fall into

1120
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,247
a trap of a conversation
about winning back quote.

1121
00:47:47,247 --> 00:47:50,513
"The guy in the Midwest
which is code" unquote.

1122
00:47:50,513 --> 00:47:52,863
What is it code for what
do you mean by that?

1123
00:47:52,863 --> 00:47:55,080
- What I mean is that there is
a conversation that has been

1124
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,893
happening among many
people including pundits.

1125
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,313
That suggest, no I don't mean you.

1126
00:48:01,313 --> 00:48:03,396
(laughs)

1127
00:48:04,406 --> 00:48:07,256
- I didn't think so but thank
you, thanks for clarifying.

1128
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,613
- I just meant on TV.

1129
00:48:12,049 --> 00:48:13,420
(laughs)

1130
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:15,270
I just keep digging myself into this.

1131
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:18,640
They will be talking of
course about my performance

1132
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,010
tonight those same pundits.

1133
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:24,210
Okay in any event, there is
a conversation that all of us

1134
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:27,560
have been hearing about,
especially the 2020 election.

1135
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,290
Which is a conversation saying

1136
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:33,085
oh who can talk to the
person in the Midwest.

1137
00:48:33,085 --> 00:48:38,085
And I just reject that notion
that you have one conversation

1138
00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:39,960
with someone in the Midwest.

1139
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,120
And another conversation
with somebody in the South.

1140
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:44,860
And another conversation with
people who live on the coast.

1141
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:49,370
I reject that notion and I
think it is short sighted

1142
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:52,130
and it is actually not connected

1143
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:54,720
with where people really are.

1144
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,983
The American public don't want that.

1145
00:48:56,983 --> 00:48:58,953
(audience applauds)

1146
00:48:58,953 --> 00:49:00,236
They don't want that.

1147
00:49:00,236 --> 00:49:02,100
(audience applauds)

1148
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:03,390
So that's what I meant by that comment.

1149
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:06,880
- All right, let's bring
in now Kimberly Morrow.

1150
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,970
She is a senior studying
politics and has worked full time

1151
00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:10,856
while attending school

1152
00:49:10,856 --> 00:49:13,323
at the University of New
Hampshire Manchester.

1153
00:49:13,323 --> 00:49:14,580
Kimberly what's your question?

1154
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:16,200
- Good evening Senator.

1155
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,760
Through my studies as a
polices and society major

1156
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,620
at UNH Manchester, I've learned

1157
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:22,080
that women in our country face

1158
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:24,750
very real inequalities in the workplace.

1159
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:28,490
Women trail men in income,
promotion to leadership positions

1160
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:30,880
and labor force participation rates.

1161
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,030
What do you plan to do as president

1162
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:36,450
to level the playing field
and empower working women?

1163
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:39,570
- Well on day one we need to pass the ERA,

1164
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:41,450
Equal Rights Amendment.

1165
00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:45,590
We also need to speak
louder about the realities

1166
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:47,380
of the facts just as you've done now

1167
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:49,770
and thank you for your leadership on this.

1168
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:54,350
Because it is something
that has to be acknowledged

1169
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:55,210
and dealt with.

1170
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:59,370
Women are paid on
average 70% to the dollar

1171
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:01,710
and then if you look at African
American women and Latinas

1172
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:05,240
even less and for doing the same work.

1173
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:08,350
You look at the fact that
we have a real battle

1174
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:10,370
in this country around minimum wage

1175
00:50:10,370 --> 00:50:12,610
and the need to increase minimum wage.

1176
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:15,530
We should understand minimum
wage is a minimum standard

1177
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:19,820
of living but federal minimum
wage is $7.25 an hour,

1178
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:22,350
which averages $15,000 a year

1179
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:26,320
and the majority of women
are minimum wage workers.

1180
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:28,340
Let's look at the issue of
what we need to do around

1181
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:31,610
disparities around issues like childcare.

1182
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:34,780
Understanding that women
are the primary caregiver

1183
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:37,690
to children and yet we
don't have a national policy

1184
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:40,630
around affordable childcare
which I'm a proponent of.

1185
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:44,170
We need to also address what
is happening in terms of

1186
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:47,210
understanding that women's
issues to the point of being

1187
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,730
marginalized have to
brought to the forefront.

1188
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:51,840
And we should also reject the conversation

1189
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,330
that women's issues are just for women

1190
00:50:54,330 --> 00:50:55,700
to be concerned about.

1191
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:58,320
When in fact the reality
is that when you lift up

1192
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,650
the economic status of women.

1193
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:02,737
You lift up the economic
status of families

1194
00:51:02,737 --> 00:51:05,370
and communities and all of society.

1195
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:06,526
That's how I feel about that.

1196
00:51:06,526 --> 00:51:08,050
(audience applauds)

1197
00:51:08,050 --> 00:51:11,570
- Matthew Solomon is from
Massachusetts he's a junior at

1198
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:14,480
Saint Anselm studying politics
and peace and justice.

1199
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,310
He's also the president of the school's

1200
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:17,913
LGBTQ alliance, Matthew.

1201
00:51:17,913 --> 00:51:19,807
- Hi Senator thanks for being here.

1202
00:51:19,807 --> 00:51:20,640
- Of course.

1203
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,980
- So my question is if elected president

1204
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:25,800
what kind of protections,
specific protections,

1205
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,460
will you providing for
the LBGTQ plus community

1206
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:31,150
and especially those who lack visibility

1207
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:33,460
and safety like the transgender community

1208
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:35,900
and LBGTQ plus community members of color.

1209
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:38,410
- Right, so I have my entire career

1210
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:40,980
and life been an ally of LBGTQ community

1211
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:45,020
and I will say that we must have a country

1212
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:49,090
that agrees that no
group should be treated

1213
00:51:49,090 --> 00:51:50,980
without equality under the law.

1214
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:52,390
And right now that is the case

1215
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:53,650
and we have got to change it.

1216
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:58,650
I am on day one would pass
the Equality Act to make sure

1217
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:02,570
that we actually correct
what is wrong and give LBGTQ

1218
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:04,560
people equal rights under the law.

1219
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,870
This is a civil rights
and human rights issue

1220
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:08,050
and we must address it.

1221
00:52:08,050 --> 00:52:10,410
And I'll tell you my background on this.

1222
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:14,580
I was as attorney general, it
was one of the pivotal issues

1223
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:16,490
in my race to become attorney general.

1224
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:20,320
Whether or not the elected
attorney general would defend

1225
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:23,100
a patently unconstitutional law

1226
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:26,410
which denied same sex
couples the right to marry.

1227
00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:28,390
I said I would not defend it

1228
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:31,520
because I knew it to be unconstitutional.

1229
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,140
I won and I did not
defend it, prop eight went

1230
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:35,910
to the United States Supreme Court.

1231
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:39,450
We won and the wedding bells
rang across the country.

1232
00:52:39,450 --> 00:52:44,380
I'm very proud of that, I
will tell you back in 2004.

1233
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:46,570
When the chatter among a lot of Democrats

1234
00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:49,920
was about civil unions, I
was marrying same sex couples

1235
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,785
at San Francisco City Hall.

1236
00:52:51,785 --> 00:52:53,493
(audience applauds)
I will tell you.

1237
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:05,000
You'll remember the tragic cases

1238
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,000
involving transgender men who were killed.

1239
00:53:10,210 --> 00:53:14,840
And there was this defense
that was happening in Court.

1240
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:19,840
Where the murderer was calling
it the gay panic defense.

1241
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:24,410
Oh, I panicked cause I didn't
know he was gay and therefore

1242
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:27,660
I should not be convicted of
murder and this was happening

1243
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:30,820
around the Matthew Shepherd
case, around that era.

1244
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:32,940
When I was district
attorney of San Francisco

1245
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:34,950
knowing this was happening.

1246
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:39,020
I brought DAs from around
the country to San Francisco

1247
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:43,220
where I hosted and created
a training for prosecutors

1248
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:47,433
around the country on how to
defeat the gay panic defense.

1249
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:51,220
On the issue of transgender rights.

1250
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:55,010
Listen right now in
particular we have a president

1251
00:53:55,010 --> 00:53:57,820
who is reviving, you
know the courts said no,

1252
00:53:57,820 --> 00:53:59,440
but then that changed.

1253
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,490
And now we've got a president who is

1254
00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:04,050
basically putting in place a process

1255
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:07,480
for discharging transgender men and women

1256
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:13,090
who have made a commitment to our country

1257
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:15,950
and to defend our democracy

1258
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:19,500
at great service and potential sacrifice.

1259
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:23,060
And this president wants to
kick them out of the military

1260
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,480
because they are transgender.

1261
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:30,670
It is absolutely unconscionable
and that is something

1262
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:33,140
I would reverse immediately

1263
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:35,974
when I am elected president
of the United States.

1264
00:54:35,974 --> 00:54:37,220
(audience applauds)

1265
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:38,940
- I wanna bring in Rachel Damle.

1266
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:40,550
Rachel is a sophomore at Harvard

1267
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:42,714
she's from Colorado, Rachel.

1268
00:54:42,714 --> 00:54:44,800
- Hi Senator.
- Hi Rachel.

1269
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:47,020
- The past couple of years
have seen young people getting

1270
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:49,010
involved in politics and activism.

1271
00:54:49,010 --> 00:54:51,150
Organizing around issues
such as gun control

1272
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:52,400
and climate change.

1273
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,570
Given that policies passed
now will affect the younger

1274
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:56,340
generation for years to come.

1275
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:57,173
Do you believe that Americans should have

1276
00:54:57,173 --> 00:54:59,930
the right to vote at age 16?

1277
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:02,130
- I'm really interested in
having that conversation

1278
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:03,330
I have to tell you that.

1279
00:55:04,430 --> 00:55:09,300
I think that there is no question
that if we are looking at

1280
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:11,070
what is going on in our country.

1281
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:12,980
We are putting more responsibilities

1282
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:14,850
on people at a younger age.

1283
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:18,400
And the larger number of
people that we can involve

1284
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,127
in the electoral process,

1285
00:55:20,127 --> 00:55:21,970
I think the more robust it will be.

1286
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:24,220
I think one of the downsides

1287
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:27,740
of the way that our system
is currently constructed.

1288
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:30,900
But thanks to CNN for doing
this town hall with students,

1289
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:33,400
is that if people don't vote
or they don't write checks

1290
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,270
they don't get heard.

1291
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:39,140
And I believe strongly that
you can judge a society

1292
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:40,940
based on how it treats its children.

1293
00:55:42,190 --> 00:55:47,190
And you can look at what we
are not doing for our students

1294
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:50,110
for our teenagers and even younger.

1295
00:55:50,110 --> 00:55:52,840
And I believe that if they
had greater political power

1296
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:55,210
maybe we would get our act together

1297
00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:56,660
a little bit better than
what we've been doing

1298
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:59,010
and maybe that's one
of the steps toward it.

1299
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:01,810
I will also say though that
what I am so excited about

1300
00:56:01,810 --> 00:56:03,367
in terms of seeing who's
here and I know you guys have

1301
00:56:03,367 --> 00:56:05,872
been here for like five hours.

1302
00:56:05,872 --> 00:56:07,573
(laughs)
- They have.

1303
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:12,350
- Is that one of things
that we have to remember

1304
00:56:12,350 --> 00:56:14,250
about the history of our country

1305
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:17,150
is some of the greatest movements

1306
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:19,460
that we have had that
have brought about change,

1307
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:21,850
social change, advancement, progress

1308
00:56:21,850 --> 00:56:25,507
have been fueled and
born from our students.

1309
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:27,660
- Thank you senator.
- Thank you.

1310
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:29,410
- That's it for Senator.

1311
00:56:29,410 --> 00:56:30,959
Thank you, I know it went by fast right?

1312
00:56:30,959 --> 00:56:33,140
So we wanna thank Senator Kamala Harris

1313
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:34,600
we wish you all the very best.

1314
