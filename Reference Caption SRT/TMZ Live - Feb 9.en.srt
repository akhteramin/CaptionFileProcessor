1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,475
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,475 --> 00:00:05,042
- We have a fairly widespread
winter weather advisory.

3
00:00:05,042 --> 00:00:07,625
(upbeat music)

4
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:11,291

(energetic music)

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,470
- [Announcer] Today on TMZ...

7
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,220
- This is clearly the
roll-up to the Grammys,

8
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,820
and Beyonce is skating there.

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,361
- [Katie] Janelle Monáe
had a roller skating party

10
00:00:25,361 --> 00:00:28,130
and her guest of honor was Beyonce.

11
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:29,710
- I'm just thinking people actually

12
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:30,820
go out during the weekdays?

13
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,630
- Celebrities don't go out on the weekend.

14
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:33,620
They go out during the week.

15
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:34,670
- If you don't have a real job,

16
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,100
it's better to party on those days.

17
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,950
- I can't go out, like, on
a Tuesday, a Monday night,

18
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:39,783
with everybody else.

19
00:00:39,783 --> 00:00:40,990
I have to be at work everyday.

20
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:42,760
- You also have two
young children at home!

21
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,050
- You have children, Raquel.

22
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,210
- Ariana Grande is calling

23
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:47,950
the producer of the Grammys a liar.

24
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,140
The producer, Ken Ehrlich,

25
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,450
said that Ariana pulled out

26
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:51,870
because she was too frazzled

27
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,290
and couldn't get a decent
performance together in time.

28
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,370
Ariana is pissed.

29
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:56,203
She even tweeted:

30
00:00:56,203 --> 00:00:57,637
"I can pull together a
performance overnight

31
00:00:57,637 --> 00:00:59,060
"and you know that, Ken."

32
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,150
- When you say the name
Ken, you're really mad.

33
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,789
Dammit, Ken, you know that about me.

34
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:05,800
(group laughs)

35
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,920
- We got Matt Gaetz.

36
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,300
He is Republican, a
representative from Florida.

37
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,620
And when we say people are calling you

38
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,787
the conservative
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez...

39
00:01:12,787 --> 00:01:13,620
- [Reporter] You think you guys could be

40
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,690
a power couple together?

41
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:15,523
- I don't know.

42
00:01:15,523 --> 00:01:16,356
That might be a little presumptuous of me,

43
00:01:16,356 --> 00:01:18,890
but I would certainly swipe
right on the opportunity.

44
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:20,850
- He's incredibly charming in this video.

45
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,330
- He represents Pensacola, Florida,

46
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,690
which is very conservative.

47
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:26,170
- Fun fact, Pensacola,
Florida has the most

48
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,560
whitest sandest beaches
in the United States.

49
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,758
- Pensacola, even the beaches are white.

50
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:33,640
(group laughs)

51
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,230
- Jen Selter hit up the beaches of Cabo

52
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,210
in this really cute bikini.

53
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:39,160
She looks incredible.

54
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,200
- Hey, you know what?

55
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,510
She's been a little bit thirsty

56
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:45,070
because today the weather is 22 degrees.

57
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,451
- That's Celsius.

58
00:01:46,451 --> 00:01:49,034
(group laughs)

59
00:01:49,997 --> 00:01:51,008

Oh, yeah.

66
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,632
Goo-goo, ga-ga,

67
00:02:01,632 --> 00:02:03,820
Conor McGregor.

68
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,070
- Conor McGregor just looks so good.

69
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,870
- He's got a great body and his swagger.

70
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,810
- [Announcer] He's got so much swagger,

71
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,560
even the waves can't knock him down.

72
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,280
Now, who's the party pooper?

73
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,340
- No, the swim diaper keeps
all the boo-boo inside.

74
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,770
- [Announcer] Good to know.

75
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:19,890
So, who's the kid?

76
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:20,790
- He's with Conor, Junior,

77
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:21,800
his firstborn sun.

78
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,668
It was a warm, winter day in Miami.

79
00:02:24,668 --> 00:02:25,630
- Aw.

80
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,280
- [Announcer] Yep, Conor spent
an idyllic day by the sea

81
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,000
with his one-year-old son,

82
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,930
a little too idyllic if you ask this guy.

83
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,270
- Is this, um, orchestrated?

84
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,730
- Naw, Conor takes his son everywhere.

85
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,470
He took his son to the Superbowl.

86
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,150
- [Announcer] Yeah, he likes...

87
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,160
Being seen with his adorable child.

88
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,150
Wait a minute!

89
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,050
- It's interesting,

90
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,910
because it is a way of softening
his image after the dolly.

91
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,520
- [Announcer] As in the
dolly Conor hurled at a bus

92
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:57,090
causing painful injuries to
a fellow UFC fighter's face?

93
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,410
And speaking of faces,

94
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,440
it's like Conor's looking into a mirror.

95
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,540
Oh!

96
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,517
- Right now, it's very chilly out here.

97
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,530
If you can afford it,

98
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,870
why not go to Miami where
it's in the high 70s?

99
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,170
- He's from Ireland.

100
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,110
- That's even worse than L.A.

101
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,170
That's negative, probably, like who knows?

102
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,320
- I want to open my phone day

103
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,270
and have it say negative who knows.

104
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,670
- Oh my God, that's I need a jacket,

105
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,920
it's negative probably who knows.

106
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,924
- And then you open it up,
it says hot as fish grease.

107
00:03:20,924 --> 00:03:23,930
(group laughs)

108
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,507
- [Announcer] Happy dadding!

109
00:03:25,507 --> 00:03:26,340
Daddy.

110
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,900
- Kim Kardashian was
on Jimmy Fallon's show

111
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,270
and was talking all about her fourth kid,

112
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,980
but you really couldn't concentrate

113
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,100
because she was so freaking gorgeous

114
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,500
in this like skintight snakeskin dress.

115
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,430
I know we say this all the time,

116
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,320
but it really is the
best she's ever looked.

117
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,560
- She looks amazing every day.

118
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,530
It's ridiculous.

119
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,580
- How long does it take Kim
Kardashian to get ready?

120
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,413
- Hours.

121
00:03:48,413 --> 00:03:49,810
Hours.

122
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,240
- Oh God, to sit there.

123
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,860
- Why do you care about sitting there?

124
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,006
Someone's pampering and you're drinking.

125
00:03:56,006 --> 00:03:56,839
Who cares?

126
00:03:56,839 --> 00:03:57,839
- The worst.

127
00:03:57,839 --> 00:03:58,990
It would just drive me crazy.

128
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,390
- How long does it take you to get ready?

129
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,560
- 11 minutes.

130
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,500
- You time yourself?

131
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,720
- Uh-huh, I know exact,

132
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,991
because I have to time
myself in the morning.

133
00:04:04,991 --> 00:04:06,440
- What do you do at the 11th minute?

134
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,180
What's the last, like, ugh!

135
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,510
- Do you wink at yourself?

136
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,327
- The last one is you got this, Levin.

137
00:04:11,327 --> 00:04:13,910
(group laughs)

138
00:04:16,016 --> 00:04:17,180
(intense music)

139
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,460
- [Announcer] It's one of the
biggest feuds in Hollywood.

140
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,520
Ariana Grande versus this guy!

141
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,580
Who the hell is that, Richard Dreyfus?

142
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,130
- Ariana Grande is calling the producer

143
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,280
of the Grammys a liar.

144
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,440
- Oh, it's Ken Ehrlich

145
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,880
who did an interview saying Ariana Grande,

146
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,600
whose face has been used everywhere

147
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,330
to promote the Grammys this year,

148
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,423
won't be performing after all

149
00:04:35,423 --> 00:04:38,287
because he claims she felt it was, quote,

150
00:04:38,287 --> 00:04:41,480
"too late for her to pull
something together," unquote.

151
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,261
And now Ariana is clapping
back Pelosi-style,

152
00:04:44,261 --> 00:04:47,277
calling Ehrlich a liar, liar McLiarson.

153
00:04:47,277 --> 00:04:48,727
- She said, "I've kept my mouth shut,

154
00:04:48,727 --> 00:04:49,957
"but now you're lying about me.

155
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:51,667
"I can pull together a
performance overnight,

156
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:52,940
"and you know that, Ken."

157
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,170
- [Announcer] According to Ariana,

158
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:57,170
she wanted to sing her hit
song Japanese barbecue,

159
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,020
AKA 7 rings,

160
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,280
but Ken didn't think the
audience would relate,

161
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,840
to which Ariana said, thank you, next.

162
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,510
So, who do we believe?

163
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:08,350
- I am 100% Team Ariana.

164
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,183
- Nah.

165
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:12,650
- They are putting her
everywhere, her face everywhere,

166
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:15,850
because they want her audience
to come to the Grammys.

167
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,400
- 7 rings is the number one
song in the country right now.

168
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,600
That doesn't make any sense to me.

169
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,800
- Who do we know all this from?

170
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,633
- I know it.

171
00:05:21,633 --> 00:05:22,466
- Do we have Ken's comment?

172
00:05:22,466 --> 00:05:24,330
- What Ken says is that
she was too frazzled

173
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,163
to pull it together.

174
00:05:25,163 --> 00:05:26,640
- Right, and it's not true.

175
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,120
Did you see the statement?

176
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,311
- From whom?
- Ken!

177
00:05:29,311 --> 00:05:30,310
- [Announcer] Guys, guys!

178
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,460
Calm down.

179
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,330
Perhaps we need some estrogen
to clear this all up.

180
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,030
- They only let you perform
songs that are nominated.

181
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,390
That song is not nominated.

182
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:41,531
(group cheers)

183
00:05:41,531 --> 00:05:42,980
- [Announcer] You tell 'em, girl.

184
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,180
Except for one thing.

185
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,890
- Last year at the Grammys,

186
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,840
Childish Gambino performed a
song that was not nominated

187
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,220
and so did Sam Smith.

188
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,190
- [Announcer] Women, right?

189
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,060
Hey, at least they tried.

190
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,440
We'll miss you at the
Grammys this year, Ariana.

191
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,070
Well, maybe Ken won't, but you know.

192
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,608
Everyone else will.

193
00:05:58,608 --> 00:05:59,770
(energetic music)

194
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:00,906
- I love you, beard.

195
00:06:00,906 --> 00:06:01,860
(audience laughs)

196
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,480
- [Producer] Julian Edelman's
playoff beard is no more.

197
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,313
- [Harvey] Oh, you're kidding.

198
00:06:05,313 --> 00:06:06,146
He finally shaved it off.

199
00:06:06,146 --> 00:06:07,930
- And it's because of Ellen DeGeneres.

200
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:10,000
So, Julian Edelman had this epic beard.

201
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,260
He's been growing it nine months,

202
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,970
so it's around training camp time.

203
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,510
He went on Ellen DeGeneres,

204
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:17,560
and she said I'll donate $10,000
to the Boys and Girls Club.

205
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,290
- But you need to let me
shave that beard first.

206
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,123
- Let's do it.

207
00:06:21,123 --> 00:06:21,956
Let's do it.

208
00:06:21,956 --> 00:06:22,789
- Yay!
(audience cheers)

209
00:06:22,789 --> 00:06:24,010
- So, how does he look after it?

210
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,894
- [Blond Man] So, he's
actually a very beautiful man.

211
00:06:25,894 --> 00:06:28,185
- [Female Staff Member] He's so hot.

212
00:06:28,185 --> 00:06:30,041
Oh my God, he's so hot.

213
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,308
- [Male Crew Member] Is he
hotter with the beard or without?

214
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:32,141
- [Female Staff Member] Without.

215
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,074
He's so hot.

216
00:06:33,074 --> 00:06:34,450
- [Harvey] Yeah, he's great-looking.

217
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,740
- Everybody's hotter with a beard.

218
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,573
- I agree.

219
00:06:36,573 --> 00:06:37,406
- That's not true.

220
00:06:37,406 --> 00:06:38,239
- Not true at all.

221
00:06:38,239 --> 00:06:39,110
- Everybody's better with a beard.

222
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,440
- No.
- Yes, girls love,

223
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,842
like, a George Michael overgrow.

224
00:06:41,842 --> 00:06:42,675
- That's not true!

225
00:06:42,675 --> 00:06:44,020
Stop saying what we like.

226
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,167
- Julian Edelman looks
a million times better

227
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:48,000
without a beard.

228
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,160
- No, not at all.

229
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,175
No, beards.

230
00:06:50,175 --> 00:06:51,420
Beards, man.

231
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,490
- No, that's not true.

232
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:53,440
- Believe me, man.

233
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,361
Girls like beards.

234
00:06:54,361 --> 00:06:55,244
- I don't.
- No.

235
00:06:55,244 --> 00:06:56,100
- Not true.

236
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,548
- Girls like beards
because a baby face means--

237
00:06:57,548 --> 00:06:59,570
- Stop telling us what girls like.

238
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:01,670
(group laughs)

239
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,337
- Girls like beards.

240
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:05,534
(audience cheering)

241
00:07:05,534 --> 00:07:08,127
(upbeat music)

242
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:09,100
(intense music)

243
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,400
- [Reporter] Congressman
Gaetz, how you doing, man?

244
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,233
- Good.

245
00:07:11,233 --> 00:07:12,110
- [Announcer] Fellow Americans,

246
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,360
say hello to Republican
congressman Matt Gaetz

247
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,160
from the great state of Florida.

248
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,723
- Super conservative, I believe.

249
00:07:19,723 --> 00:07:21,940
- Very conservative,
very much about the wall.

250
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,690
- [Announcer] In fact,
many are calling him

251
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,630
the conservative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

252
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,990
- Well, that is totally unfair.

253
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:31,260
AOC is way more interesting and attractive

254
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,557
and capable than I am.

255
00:07:32,557 --> 00:07:33,830
- He said capable?

256
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:34,663
- Capable.

257
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:36,460
- Did he just sandwich that attractive in?

258
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,700
- Literally right in between the two.

259
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,990
- [Announcer] Ooh, well,
maybe you can get Rashida

260
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,770
to pass her a note during session.

261
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,630
But you two are so different!

262
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,510
For instance, she likes dancing,

263
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,680
and you try to get parents
of Parkland victims

264
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,450
kicked out of a congressional hearing.

265
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:50,830
Listen, the biggest
difference in this town

266
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,650
isn't whether people are
Republicans or Democrats.

267
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,520
It's whether they want to
shake the place up or not.

268
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,260
She does, and I admire her for it.

269
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,580
- [Announcer] Wow, I don't
remember any congressperson

270
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,960
ever saying that about another
congressperson that way.

271
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,480
- Republicans, like, usually their line is

272
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,410
she's young and stupid.

273
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,160
Like, that's what's always
their criticism of her.

274
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,007
- Sometimes, haters just gotta hate, man,

275
00:08:08,007 --> 00:08:09,230
and that's not what I'm about.

276
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,740
- [Announcer] So, what
is Matt Gaetz about?

277
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:15,480
Well, he's extremely pro-gun,
but is also pro-marijuana,

278
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,140
which means you can be prepared

279
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:20,530
for the zombie apocalypse but
won't care when it happens.

280
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:23,341
Say, you know who else is pro-marijuana?

281
00:08:23,341 --> 00:08:24,560
AOC.

282
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,710
- I would certainly swipe
right on the opportunity

283
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,840
to write a cannabis bill with her.

284
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,673
- [Announcer] Dude.

285
00:08:29,673 --> 00:08:30,799
(group groans)

286
00:08:30,799 --> 00:08:32,000
- [All] No.

287
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,230
- Are you kidding me?

288
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,700
- I think would it help America

289
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,440
if those guys, like, started dating.

290
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,457
They seem like Romeo and Juliet
a little bit, don't they?

291
00:08:39,457 --> 00:08:40,820
- [Announcer] And that turned out great.

292
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,787
- If he does take a chance on
pissing off his electorate,

293
00:08:43,787 --> 00:08:45,570
he represents Pensacola, Florida,

294
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:46,510
which is very conservative.

295
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,630
- Wait, fun fact.

296
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:50,810
Pensacola, Florida has the
most whitest sandest beaches

297
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:51,700
in the United States.

298
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,387
- Pensacola, even the beaches are white.

299
00:08:53,387 --> 00:08:55,820
(all laugh)

300
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,653
- [Reporter] Thanks, Congressman.

301
00:08:56,653 --> 00:08:57,778
- [Announcer] Politics!

302
00:08:57,778 --> 00:08:58,810
(intense music)

303
00:08:58,810 --> 00:08:59,643
- Jen Selter,

304
00:08:59,643 --> 00:09:01,450
super popular Instagram model,

305
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:05,178
hit up the beaches of Cabo
in this really cute bikini.

306
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:06,420
She looks incredible.

307
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,330
- She was like the OG butt girl,

308
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,673
and now I, I don't even know
what the hell happened to her.

309
00:09:10,673 --> 00:09:12,250
- Jen Selter is still big.

310
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,421
- I disagree.

311
00:09:13,421 --> 00:09:15,360
- We haven't heard from her in a while.

312
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,250
- She has 13 million Instagram followers.

313
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,010
She just launched a whole, like,

314
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,750
fitness diet plan and everything.

315
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,730
She's doing great.

316
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,490
- [Patrick] If you have 13
million Instagram followers,

317
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,680
you can make hundreds
of thousands of dollars

318
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,230
advertising products on Instagram.

319
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,810
She's doing really, really well.

320
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,310
Much better than most of
the other Instagram models.

321
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,431
- Hey, you know what?

322
00:09:31,431 --> 00:09:33,270
She's being a little bit thirsty,

323
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:36,142
because today the weather is 22 degrees.

324
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:36,975
(group laughs)

325
00:09:36,975 --> 00:09:37,952
- That's Celsius.

326
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:41,050
(group laughs)

327
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,278
- Oh.

328
00:09:42,278 --> 00:09:44,361

to having a gold record in six months.

490
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,570
- Danielle Bregoli is breaking records,

491
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:12,700
so she had her own show come
out on Snapchat this week,

492
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,800
and it's called Bringing up Bhabie.

493
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,150
This thing killed it.

494
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:20,000
On the very first day, it
got over 10 million views.

495
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,700
Snapchat even said

496
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,980
if you compare this to Keeping
Up with the Kardashians,

497
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:24,813
Keeping Up with the Kardashians

498
00:15:24,813 --> 00:15:27,441
gets about 1.5 million views.

499
00:15:27,441 --> 00:15:28,450
- She's a hit.

500
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:30,961
- She's supposed to make 10
million dollars this year.

501
00:15:30,961 --> 00:15:33,580
- If I had to put my
money on a 15-year-old

502
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,480
becoming rich and famous,

503
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,430
she's gonna be in the top five.

504
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,180
- Well, she's already rich and famous.

505
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,120
- So, that's a pretty good win.

506
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,106
(group laughs)

507
00:15:42,106 --> 00:15:43,617
- You really went out on a limb.

508
00:15:43,617 --> 00:15:45,430
- But you also helped her out a lot.

509
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:46,970
We picture her every other day.

510
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:49,480
Every time that we talk about
a lot of people, though,

511
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,220
a nobody, we help them out so much,

512
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,270
it's insane.

513
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,130
- And guess what they do
after they get famous?

514
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:55,963
- Don't talk to us.

515
00:15:55,963 --> 00:15:57,060
- Exactly.

516
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,700
- You know what happens when
they stop being famous, though?

517
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,970
- We stop talking to them.

518
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:00,803
So.
- Ha!

519
00:16:00,803 --> 00:16:02,145
- So, we'll talk to anybody.

520
00:16:03,891 --> 00:16:04,863
- That's the party line.

521
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,446
(group laughs)

522
00:16:09,664 --> 00:16:10,560
(intense music)

523
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,780
- [Announcer] And now,

524
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,350
As the Bezos Turns.

525
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,460
Money,

526
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,920
wiener pics,

527
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,210
Amazon,

528
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,199
dating,

529
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,810
Bezos.

530
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,330
Yes, it's been a crazy week

531
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,950
for the richest man in the world,

532
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,110
but now, new drama.

533
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:30,320
His new girlfriend's estranged
husband is dating this chick.

534
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,005
Wait, we've got a better photo.

535
00:16:32,005 --> 00:16:33,540
Oh, right.

536
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,930
- Patrick Whitesell,

537
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:37,330
the super agent from
William Morris Endeavor--

538
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,160
- Also known as Lauren
Sanchez's estranged husband.

539
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,910
- [Announcer] Right, because
he was married to her

540
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,070
and friends with him

541
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,500
and introduced her to him

542
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,470
and now they're together.

543
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:49,000
- But Patrick is okay because
we got him out last night

544
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,150
and he was with hot
model named Keira Alexa,

545
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,690
but they did the thing where
they walk out separately.

546
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,420
- And then get in the
same car in the backseat.

547
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,850
- [Announcer] Slick move, guys.

548
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,750
Now tell us about this hot lady!

549
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,080
- Her name is Keira Alexa.

550
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,120
She's a model, and that's
all I know about her.

551
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,730
- [Announcer] Thanks for
that detailed report.

552
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:05,990
We'll take it from here.

553
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,630
She loves to sell cookies,

554
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,580
wear bras,

555
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,920
and also not wear bras.

556
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,690
Oh, and she looks a lot
like Patrick's ex Lauren.

557
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:17,880
- She's roughly 25 years
younger than Lauren.

558
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,200
- [Announcer] That explains the cookies.

559
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,310
- Does it bother Lauren?

560
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,143
Probably a little bit.

561
00:17:21,143 --> 00:17:22,850
- No, Lauren is with Jeff Bezos.

562
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:25,390
- [Announcer] Speaking of,
he's got some drama of his own

563
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,223
with that whole--

564
00:17:26,223 --> 00:17:28,680
- Your semi-erect manhood
pressing against your zipper.

565
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,400
- [Announcer] We were
gonna say extortion claims,

566
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,120
but thanks for getting specific.

567
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,340
- So, the interesting thing now

568
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,371
is American Media's now saying oops,

569
00:17:35,371 --> 00:17:38,010
we're gonna investigate
ourselves in this thing,

570
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:41,120
because Jeff Bezos says
they tried blackmailing him.

571
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,243
- The emails were crazy.

572
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:47,130
- Why would National Enquirer
go get the richest man.

573
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,660
Like, that's just dumb.

574
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,830
- [Announcer] Well, let's
break it down in detail.

575
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,310
- There's a whole bunch of stuff.

576
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,750
- [Announcer] Right, so.

577
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,850
Good luck, Jeff.

578
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,020
And Patrick?

579
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,423
You already got lucky.

580
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,100
(intense music)

581
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,330
- Good news, everybody.

582
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,663
My new movie came out today.

583
00:18:02,663 --> 00:18:03,940
I don't know if you guys noticed,

584
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,430
but I'm starring in a new movie.

585
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,440
- What the hell is this?

586
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,600
- Yeah, it's true story.

587
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,910
It's called High Flying Bird.

588
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,190
It's directed by Steven Soderbergh.

589
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,500
Zazie Beetz is my costar
along with Zachary Quinto.

590
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,240
The movie's about the basketball lockout,

591
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,740
and during the best scene of the movie--

592
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,890
- Oh, man, this is getting crazy.

593
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:22,800
Jamil Umber and Erick Scott

594
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,780
seem to be going at it in public,

595
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,626
calling each other out on Twitter.

596
00:18:26,626 --> 00:18:29,250
- Never want to make these things public,

597
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,671
but these guys have.

598
00:18:30,671 --> 00:18:31,504
- Yeah.

599
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,623
That's right.

600
00:18:33,623 --> 00:18:34,456
- Did you make it?

601
00:18:35,463 --> 00:18:36,863
- Oh, that's hot.

602
00:18:36,863 --> 00:18:39,437
(group chattering)

603
00:18:39,437 --> 00:18:41,803
- I'm done, I'm canceling my Netflix.

604
00:18:41,803 --> 00:18:43,544
- You mean you're gonna
delete your mom's password.

605
00:18:43,544 --> 00:18:45,320
(group laughs)

606
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,360
- I don't know anyone who
has their own account.

607
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,193
- Oh, you use somebody else's?

608
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:49,340
- Are you serious?
- I use my mom's.

609
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:52,260
- Oh my.
(group groans)

610
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,770
- It's Netflix.

611
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,179
- How do we get that code?

612
00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:57,200
(group laughs)

613
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,460
- If your parents seen
what you might also like

614
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,293
and Raquel's got the--

615
00:19:00,293 --> 00:19:02,832
(group laughs)

616
00:19:04,463 --> 00:19:05,296
(energetic music)

617
00:19:05,296 --> 00:19:06,129
- [Announcer] Coming up...

618
00:19:06,129 --> 00:19:08,920
- Billy McFarland just got
sued for three million dollars

619
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,753
and lost.

620
00:19:09,753 --> 00:19:11,890
How do you get it from
Billy if he's in prison?

621
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,570
- Well, somebody in prison
could still have money.

622
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,560
- You know that they don't
take your money to prison

623
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,393
with you, right?

624
00:19:16,393 --> 00:19:18,411
- Well, yeah, I'm well aware of it.

625
00:19:18,411 --> 00:19:20,960
(upbeat music)

626
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,070
- I don't want to waste
time with the wrong guys

627
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,860
and miss out on the one for me.

- I'm a close talker,

635
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,053
so I was excited about
all-new Colgate Total.

636
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,589
Its breakthrough formula does more.

637
00:19:43,589 --> 00:19:44,422
- Wonderful.

638
00:19:44,422 --> 00:19:46,570
- Sensitivity, strengthens teeth,

639
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:48,800
it kills germs through my whole mouth.

640
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,380
- I like your confidence.

641
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,901
- Thanks, Mr. Lee.

00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,850
Now, there's no such thing as too close.

644
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:57,110
- Yes, there is.

645
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,330
- No, there's not.

646
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,184
- Yes, there is.

647
00:19:59,184 --> 00:20:00,017
- No, there's not.

648
00:20:00,017 --> 00:20:01,220
- Okay.

649
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,360

funded him three million dollars

759
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:56,580
One question, though.

760
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:59,110
- How do you get it from
Billy if he's in prison?

- Well, somebody in prison
can still have money.

- Well, yeah.

765
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,070
- [Announcer] Yes, but
hopefully Billy's money

766
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,470

767
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:10,480
any solid financial
planner would recommend.

768
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,570
- Dig a hole in his
backyard and put in a bag.

769
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:13,403
- It's a pretty good idea.

770
00:24:13,403 --> 00:24:14,300
- It's a terrible idea.

771
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,410
- What about under the
sea like a lobster trap

772
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,340
and then you like bring it
up when you're out of prison.

773
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,590
- [Announcer] Yeah, unless

and is living large on your cheddar, yo.

775
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,480
But here's a better
idea for Billy's money.

776
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,680
- He put it in commissary.

777
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,180
You invest it in commissary.

778
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,013
- Pretty made-up.

779
00:24:29,013 --> 00:24:32,270
I've got 14 billion
dollars in the commissary.

780

hopefully Billy's got that
three mil buried someplace.

784
00:24:39,476 --> 00:24:41,340
- I know a lot of people
who have money buried.

785
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,280

in their back yard.

787
00:24:44,113 --> 00:24:44,946
- A thousand percent.

788
00:24:44,946 --> 00:24:46,820

that's a lot of percent,
