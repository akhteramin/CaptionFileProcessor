1
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:03,760
- Is one debate, I suggest you open up

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,028
and begin reading it or
next time you're asked

3
00:00:07,028 --> 00:00:10,480
don't profess to be one
that practices that,

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,080
and at least learn one or two verses

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,908
that mean something to you.

6
00:00:13,908 --> 00:00:16,608
Because maybe all of it, as you said,

7
00:00:16,608 --> 00:00:19,236
was what your favorite is is too much

8
00:00:19,236 --> 00:00:23,268
for you to consume and
practice at the same time.

9
00:00:23,268 --> 00:00:24,860
That does it for me,

10
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,258
thanks for watching,
I'll see you back here

11
00:00:27,258 --> 00:00:29,687
next Saturday at 5:00 p.m. Eastern.

12
00:00:29,687 --> 00:00:32,195
Until then keep the conversation going,

13
00:00:32,195 --> 00:00:36,026
like us at Facebook.com/politicsnation,

14
00:00:36,026 --> 00:00:39,446
and follow us on Twitter @politicsnation.

15
00:00:39,446 --> 00:00:42,779
Up next, Meet the Press with Chuck Todd.

16
00:00:46,586 --> 00:00:49,103
- [Chuck] This Sunday, divided Democrats.

17
00:00:49,103 --> 00:00:50,170
Bernie versus Biden,

18
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,810
progressives versus traditional Democrats,

19
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,529
highlighted by this comment

20
00:00:54,529 --> 00:00:57,132
from freshman Congresswoman Ilhan Omar.

21
00:00:57,132 --> 00:01:00,056
- I want to talk about
the political influence

22
00:01:00,056 --> 00:01:01,740
in this country

23
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,986
that says it is okay for people to push

24
00:01:04,986 --> 00:01:07,746
for allegiance to a foreign country.

25
00:01:07,746 --> 00:01:09,640
- [Chuck] Some fellow
Democrats hear bigotry.

26
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,184
- The use of anti-Semitic language

27
00:01:11,184 --> 00:01:13,800
and images can never be tolerated.

28
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,672
- [Chuck] Others rush to her defense.

29
00:01:15,672 --> 00:01:18,044
- What I hear is her trying
to uplift my grandmother

30
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:19,784
in Palestine, in the West Bank.

31
00:01:19,784 --> 00:01:21,660
- [Chuck] The debate
exposing real fissures

32
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,928
in the Democratic Party
with implications for 2020.

33
00:01:24,928 --> 00:01:26,227
My guests this morning,

34
00:01:26,227 --> 00:01:28,504
Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio

35
00:01:28,504 --> 00:01:30,260
and Representative Liz Cheney,

36
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,433
chair of the House Republican Conference.

37
00:01:32,433 --> 00:01:35,618
Plus, waiting for Biden,
Sherrod Brown not running,

38
00:01:35,618 --> 00:01:38,588
Michael Bloomberg not
running, both likely out,

39
00:01:38,588 --> 00:01:41,078
because they expect Joe Biden to get in.

40
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:42,848
- I have not made the final decision.

41
00:01:42,848 --> 00:01:44,422
But don't be surprised.

42
00:01:44,422 --> 00:01:46,464
- [Chuck] So what is Biden waiting for?

43
00:01:46,464 --> 00:01:47,884
And pardon me?

44
00:01:47,884 --> 00:01:50,433
Did Michael Cohen ask
President Trump for a pardon?

45
00:01:50,433 --> 00:01:54,334
- I have never asked for,
nor would I accept, a pardon.

46
00:01:54,334 --> 00:01:56,482
- And that's a stone-cold lie.

47
00:01:56,482 --> 00:01:58,023
- I'll talk about that,

48
00:01:58,023 --> 00:01:59,346
the surprise Manafort sentencing,

49
00:01:59,346 --> 00:02:01,640
and the latest on the Russia investigation

50
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,895
with the chair of the House
Intelligence Committee,

51
00:02:03,895 --> 00:02:05,032
Adam Schiff.

52
00:02:05,032 --> 00:02:07,104
Joining me for insight and analysis are

53
00:02:07,104 --> 00:02:09,964
NBC News Capitol Hill
correspondent Kasie Hunt;

54
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:13,384
Robert Costa, moderator
of Washington Week on PBS;

55
00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:16,864
Maria Teresa Kumar,
president of Voto Latino;

56
00:02:16,864 --> 00:02:19,108
and the former Republican
governor of North Carolina,

57
00:02:19,108 --> 00:02:20,595
Pat McCrory.

58
00:02:20,595 --> 00:02:21,932
Welcome to Sunday.

59
00:02:21,932 --> 00:02:23,599
It's Meet the Press.

60
00:02:25,015 --> 00:02:26,696
- [Dennis] From NBC News in Washington,

61
00:02:26,696 --> 00:02:29,842
the longest-running show
in television history.

62
00:02:29,842 --> 00:02:33,092
This is Meet the Press with Chuck Todd.

63
00:02:33,984 --> 00:02:35,156
- Good Sunday morning.

64
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:37,060
Never mind that President
Trump's campaign chairman

65
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,976
is going to prison and that Mr. Trump

66
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,124
and Michael Cohen argued this
week over which one of them

67
00:02:41,124 --> 00:02:43,572
is lying about a possible pardon.

68
00:02:43,572 --> 00:02:45,495
Our colleague, Dana Milbank
at The Washington Post,

69
00:02:45,495 --> 00:02:47,022
pointed out that with President Trump's

70
00:02:47,022 --> 00:02:49,960
recent struggles on North
Korea, on the trade deficit,

71
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,598
on the border wall, there's only one thing

72
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:54,475
that can save him, the Democrats.

73
00:02:54,475 --> 00:02:57,539
And as he said, right
on cue, here they come.

74
00:02:57,539 --> 00:02:59,371
Democrats have spent
much of the last month

75
00:02:59,371 --> 00:03:01,452
wrestling themselves to the ground.

76
00:03:01,452 --> 00:03:02,757
They were embarrassed over the revelation

77
00:03:02,757 --> 00:03:04,139
that Virginia Governor Ralph Northam

78
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:06,151
had once dressed in blackface,

79
00:03:06,151 --> 00:03:09,283
startled by subsequent
accusations of sexual assault

80
00:03:09,283 --> 00:03:12,239
against Northam's lieutenant
governor, Justin Fairfax,

81
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,528
and chronically unsure, this week,

82
00:03:13,528 --> 00:03:14,895
over how to handle a comment

83
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:16,961
by freshman Democrat Ilhan Omar,

84
00:03:16,961 --> 00:03:20,835
her second that many saw as anti-Semitic.

85
00:03:20,835 --> 00:03:23,251
An emerging, more-progressive
cohort of elected Democrats

86
00:03:23,251 --> 00:03:24,643
is coming into conflict

87
00:03:24,643 --> 00:03:26,191
with an older generation of centrists

88
00:03:26,191 --> 00:03:27,811
and traditional liberals.

89
00:03:27,811 --> 00:03:30,943
These two Democratic factions
are united and divided.

90
00:03:30,943 --> 00:03:32,279
They're united about the urgency

91
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:34,183
of defeating President Trump next year.

92
00:03:34,183 --> 00:03:36,281
But at the same time, they are divided,

93
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:38,216
with each side seeing the other

94
00:03:38,216 --> 00:03:42,401
as the reason Mr. Trump may
wind up winning, after all.

95
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:44,667
- You apologized for your last remarks.

96
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:46,663
How are these different?

97
00:03:46,663 --> 00:03:47,955
- [Chuck] Congresswoman Ilhan Omar

98
00:03:47,955 --> 00:03:49,804
drew criticism after tweeting

99
00:03:49,804 --> 00:03:53,201
that U.S. politicians
support Israel, because,

100
00:03:53,201 --> 00:03:55,363
"It's all about the Benjamins, baby."

101
00:03:55,363 --> 00:03:59,696
She apologized but then
made this comment last week.

102
00:04:09,793 --> 00:04:12,137
- Jews have dual loyalty and
can't be patriotic members

103
00:04:12,137 --> 00:04:14,641
of the country in which they live?

104
00:04:14,641 --> 00:04:15,786
Words matter.

105
00:04:15,786 --> 00:04:18,174
- [Chuck] Some progressives defended Omar,

106
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,760
pointing to anti-Muslim slurs against her,

107
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,717
like this flier in West Virginia.

108
00:04:22,717 --> 00:04:25,987
- We think that hate and racism
in our country is growing,

109
00:04:25,987 --> 00:04:28,658
no matter if you're Jewish, LGBTQ, Latino,

110
00:04:28,658 --> 00:04:30,179
immigrant, Muslim.

111
00:04:30,179 --> 00:04:31,398
- [Chuck] Late this week,

112
00:04:31,398 --> 00:04:33,994
House Democrats united
around a broad resolution

113
00:04:33,994 --> 00:04:36,885
condemning hate, after
some progressives objected

114
00:04:36,885 --> 00:04:40,354
to an initial draft that
only rebuked anti-Semitism.

115
00:04:40,354 --> 00:04:44,604
The episode is among those
dividing 2020 Democrats.

116
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,782
- [Chuck] But several top
presidential candidates,

117
00:04:53,782 --> 00:04:55,764
while condemning anti-Semitism,

118
00:04:55,764 --> 00:04:58,148
said Omar was unfairly targeted.

119
00:04:58,148 --> 00:05:00,936
The debate is exposing
ideological, generational,

120
00:05:00,936 --> 00:05:03,819
and racial divides in
the Democratic Party,

121
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:06,501
as the progressive left
is showing its strength.

122
00:05:06,501 --> 00:05:10,540
- It is time to break up
America's tech giants.

123
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,700
- [Chuck] Some 2020
Democrats are reluctant

124
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,484
to embrace capitalism.

125
00:05:14,484 --> 00:05:17,964
- You know, again, the labels,
I'm not sure any of them fit.

126
00:05:17,964 --> 00:05:19,960
- [Chuck] Championing the Green New Deal.

127
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,664
- Does the Green New Deal go too far?

128
00:05:21,664 --> 00:05:25,488
- No, you cannot go too far on
the issue of climate change.

129
00:05:25,488 --> 00:05:27,688
- [Chuck] And calling
for Medicare for All.

130
00:05:27,688 --> 00:05:29,089
- Do you think eliminating
private insurance

131
00:05:29,089 --> 00:05:31,309
would be a socialist idea?

132
00:05:31,309 --> 00:05:33,976
- No okay, so I strongly believe

133
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,907
that we need to have Medicare for All.

134
00:05:36,907 --> 00:05:38,090
- [Chuck] Can a more centrist candidate

135
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:40,731
break through in a party
that is shifting to the left?

136
00:05:40,731 --> 00:05:42,875
- Why should we elect
a candidate who says,

137
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:43,987
no, that's not possible,

138
00:05:43,987 --> 00:05:47,359
to do everything progressives want?

139
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:48,921
- Because I'm being honest.

140
00:05:48,921 --> 00:05:49,754
- [Chuck] This week,

141
00:05:49,754 --> 00:05:51,997
both former New York City
Mayor Michael Bloomberg

142
00:05:51,997 --> 00:05:54,669
and Ohio Senator Sherrod
Brown said, no thanks,

143
00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:55,913
to a presidential run,

144
00:05:55,913 --> 00:05:58,537
with former Vice President Joe Biden

145
00:05:58,537 --> 00:06:00,533
poised to jump into the race.

146
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:02,162
- I have not made the final decision.

147
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:04,079
But don't be surprised.

148
00:06:06,101 --> 00:06:08,141
- [Chuck] Even before his run is official,

149
00:06:08,141 --> 00:06:11,065
Biden is already explaining
a decades-long record,

150
00:06:11,065 --> 00:06:12,549
including his role in passing

151
00:06:12,549 --> 00:06:16,089
the now-controversial 1994 Crime Bill,

152
00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:20,229
his vote for the Iraq war,
skepticism of Anita Hill,

153
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:23,921
and past comments on busing
to desegregate schools.

154
00:06:23,921 --> 00:06:26,365
- You know, I've been in
this fight for a long time.

155
00:06:26,365 --> 00:06:28,313
I haven't always been right.

156
00:06:28,313 --> 00:06:31,389
I know we haven't always
gotten things right.

157
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:33,341
But I've always tried.

158
00:06:33,341 --> 00:06:34,537
- And joining me now from Cleveland,

159
00:06:34,537 --> 00:06:36,517
is Democratic Senator
Sherrod Brown of Ohio,

160
00:06:36,517 --> 00:06:39,745
who announced this week,
to the surprise of many,

161
00:06:39,745 --> 00:06:42,805
that he had decided not to
run for president in 2020.

162
00:06:42,805 --> 00:06:45,343
Senator Brown, welcome back
to Meet the Press, Senator.

163
00:06:45,343 --> 00:06:46,382
- Good to be back, thanks.

164
00:06:46,382 --> 00:06:47,388
- Color us very surprised.

165
00:06:47,388 --> 00:06:48,632
In fact, the last time you were on,

166
00:06:48,632 --> 00:06:50,388
my executive producer noted,

167
00:06:50,388 --> 00:06:52,576
he was speaking about
his presidential campaign

168
00:06:52,576 --> 00:06:53,409
in the present tense.

169
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:56,737
It was so, it seemed so imminent to us.

170
00:06:56,737 --> 00:06:59,271
So you did surprise a lot of people.

171
00:06:59,271 --> 00:07:02,241
You had even begun to hire some people.

172
00:07:02,241 --> 00:07:04,372
What changed your mind?

173
00:07:04,372 --> 00:07:06,670
- Well, as you know, Chuck,
this all started off,

174
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,733
because I don't think
Democrats were talking

175
00:07:08,733 --> 00:07:11,821
to working-class Americans
of all races enough.

176
00:07:11,821 --> 00:07:13,621
If you love your country,

177
00:07:13,621 --> 00:07:15,333
you fight for the people who make it work.

178
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,760
We began our Dignity of
Work tour in four states.

179
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,144
Yes, we hired people to
help us with that tour

180
00:07:20,144 --> 00:07:22,200
and to be ready.

181
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,872
And that our goal was
to inform the narrative,

182
00:07:25,872 --> 00:07:26,968
in the Democratic Party,

183
00:07:26,968 --> 00:07:29,640
so that Democrats begin
to talk more to workers

184
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,123
and talk about the dignity of work.

185
00:07:31,123 --> 00:07:33,104
A number of candidates
have already done that,

186
00:07:33,104 --> 00:07:34,980
have been talking about
the dignity of work.

187
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,468
I predict that the Democratic nominee

188
00:07:37,468 --> 00:07:39,552
is the one that talks to workers the best.

189
00:07:39,552 --> 00:07:40,980
And I'm not just talking about workers

190
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,388
in the industrial Midwest.

191
00:07:42,388 --> 00:07:45,240
I'm talking about the
physical therapist in Nevada,

192
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,164
and the construction
worker in New Hampshire

193
00:07:48,164 --> 00:07:51,685
and the hospital worker in Baltimore.

194
00:07:51,685 --> 00:07:54,612
And I would predict, if I could do this,

195
00:07:54,612 --> 00:07:58,920
that come January 20, 2021,
that, in the inaugural,

196
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,712
when either when the
Democratic president elect

197
00:08:02,712 --> 00:08:04,989
raises her or his right hand,

198
00:08:04,989 --> 00:08:07,200
they will launch into a speech.

199
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,076
Their inaugural speech will
talk about the dignity of work.

200
00:08:10,076 --> 00:08:12,608
Because it's not just a slogan.

201
00:08:12,608 --> 00:08:15,044
It's who I am, it's what we fight for.

202
00:08:15,044 --> 00:08:16,927
But most importantly, it's how we govern

203
00:08:16,927 --> 00:08:17,760
in the end.
- Actually,

204
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,890
to reinforce what you're saying,

205
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,670
we put together a collection of folks

206
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:23,414
that stole your line, take a listen.

207
00:08:23,414 --> 00:08:25,994
- We have to reward and recognize

208
00:08:25,994 --> 00:08:27,734
the dignity of work, right?

209
00:08:27,734 --> 00:08:31,408
- There is dignity in all
work and career professionals.

210
00:08:31,408 --> 00:08:34,290
- We've got to give it
the dignity of the work

211
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:36,190
that is being performed.

212
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,093
- So Senator, your message, in some ways,

213
00:08:38,093 --> 00:08:39,910
you're doing something that
many presidential candidates

214
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,786
wish could've happened to them.

215
00:08:41,786 --> 00:08:44,258
Your initial message begins to resonate

216
00:08:44,258 --> 00:08:46,117
to the point where you've got competitors

217
00:08:46,117 --> 00:08:47,766
stealing your lines.

218
00:08:47,766 --> 00:08:49,794
So let me ask you this,
how do you not run?

219
00:08:49,794 --> 00:08:53,030
It was resonating and you still said, no.

220
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,955
- Well, it was resonating.

221
00:08:53,955 --> 00:08:55,506
And I'd say, mission accomplished.

222
00:08:55,506 --> 00:08:56,379
But I'm not done yet.

223
00:08:56,379 --> 00:08:58,791
I can do that better now from the Senate.

224
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:01,309
I mean we spent three months talking about

225
00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:02,145
the dignity of work.

226
00:09:02,145 --> 00:09:03,691
I'll continue to do that.

227
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:05,895
I went to the floor,
right after I announced

228
00:09:05,895 --> 00:09:08,326
I wasn't going to run and
talked about civil rights

229
00:09:08,326 --> 00:09:10,503
and voting rights and worker rights

230
00:09:10,503 --> 00:09:12,842
and a Supreme Court that puts its thumb

231
00:09:12,842 --> 00:09:16,967
on the scales of justice
in favoring corporations

232
00:09:16,967 --> 00:09:19,351
over workers and health
insurance companies

233
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:22,035
over sick people and Wall
Street over consumers.

234
00:09:22,035 --> 00:09:24,959
I will continue that
economic-populist fight,

235
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,518
always through the eyes of workers.

236
00:09:26,518 --> 00:09:28,095
It's what we are as a party.

237
00:09:28,095 --> 00:09:30,403
I think I can drive that
better from the Senate

238
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:34,227
than I can as one out of 15,
20 presidential candidates.

239
00:09:34,227 --> 00:09:35,844
But in that sense, we're--
- When was the last,

240
00:09:35,844 --> 00:09:36,677
I'm curious.

241
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:39,704
When was the last time
you talked to Joe Biden?

242
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,268
- October.

243
00:09:41,268 --> 00:09:42,832
- So you haven't talked to him recently.

244
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,512
This wasn't him calling around,

245
00:09:44,512 --> 00:09:45,887
letting people know he's running.

246
00:09:45,887 --> 00:09:46,720
- It was none of that.

247
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,404
I know that that's been reported.

248
00:09:48,404 --> 00:09:50,744
But the people that reported
that never called me,

249
00:09:50,744 --> 00:09:53,292
never called Connie, never
called Sarah Benzing,

250
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,244
my chief of staff,

251
00:09:55,244 --> 00:09:57,944
never called Jenny, my
communications director.

252
00:09:57,944 --> 00:09:59,444
I like Joe Biden.

253
00:09:59,444 --> 00:10:00,943
I just haven't talked to him.

254
00:10:00,943 --> 00:10:03,552
And people ask me, in almost
every one of these states,

255
00:10:03,552 --> 00:10:07,272
is Joe Biden getting in having
any impact on your decision?

256
00:10:07,272 --> 00:10:09,568
And my answer was always, zero.

257
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:11,999
- So when people were
assessing your candidacy,

258
00:10:11,999 --> 00:10:13,032
you were seen as one of these folks

259
00:10:13,032 --> 00:10:14,892
that could bridge this divide.

260
00:10:14,892 --> 00:10:16,244
You're a guy that figured out how to win

261
00:10:16,244 --> 00:10:18,824
in a red state but also had kept

262
00:10:18,824 --> 00:10:20,531
to some progressive principles.

263
00:10:20,531 --> 00:10:22,904
In fact, here's what you told The Nation

264
00:10:22,904 --> 00:10:24,780
in an interview very recently,

265
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,444
just before you decided not to run.

266
00:10:26,444 --> 00:10:27,988
You said, "If I run,
I'll be the only Democrat

267
00:10:27,988 --> 00:10:30,489
"on the stage who will have
voted against the Iraq War,

268
00:10:30,489 --> 00:10:32,968
"who will have voted against
the Defense of Marriage Act,"

269
00:10:32,968 --> 00:10:34,996
which means "and for marriage equality,

270
00:10:34,996 --> 00:10:38,468
"and who will be pro-choice,
100%, over the years."

271
00:10:38,468 --> 00:10:39,652
What was interesting
there, it seemed to me,

272
00:10:39,652 --> 00:10:42,652
it was your way of saying, hey,
I'm an experienced Democrat.

273
00:10:42,652 --> 00:10:44,576
But I'm also on the
progressive side of the lane

274
00:10:44,576 --> 00:10:47,508
in ways that other Democrats,

275
00:10:47,508 --> 00:10:50,912
perhaps you're referring
to Joe Biden, were not.

276
00:10:50,912 --> 00:10:52,564
- I was referring to nobody in particular.

277
00:10:52,564 --> 00:10:54,260
I was just saying that I've been

278
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,880
a strong progressive for years.

279
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,132
I will carry that back to the Senate.

280
00:10:58,132 --> 00:11:00,560
I will be part of this
presidential campaign,

281
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,878
in terms of calling out this president

282
00:11:02,878 --> 00:11:04,557
for his phony populism.

283
00:11:04,557 --> 00:11:07,424
Populism is never racist and anti-Semitic.

284
00:11:07,424 --> 00:11:09,120
Populism doesn't divide people.

285
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,724
Populists don't give tax cuts

286
00:11:10,724 --> 00:11:12,540
to the richest people in the country

287
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,716
and then try to cut
Medicare and Head Start.

288
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:17,460
And I will point out how this president

289
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,024
has betrayed the auto workers in Lordstown

290
00:11:20,024 --> 00:11:22,680
and betrayed hospital workers in Van Wert.

291
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,884
And I will continue to make that case

292
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,252
from the floor of the Senate,

293
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:28,304
from travels around the country,

294
00:11:28,304 --> 00:11:31,440
by not yet supporting any
presidential candidate

295
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,958
but moving the debate forward
about dignity of work.

296
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:34,791
- But let me ask you this.

297
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:35,829
Do you think there's a danger

298
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:37,539
of going too far to the left,

299
00:11:37,539 --> 00:11:41,004
that it might scare some
voters, say, in Ohio?

300
00:11:41,004 --> 00:11:43,152
- Well, I hear these stories that are,

301
00:11:43,152 --> 00:11:44,315
that's the story of the day,

302
00:11:44,315 --> 00:11:45,841
about Democrats moving to the left.

303
00:11:45,841 --> 00:11:47,420
I think the more important story

304
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:50,536
is how Republicans continue
to move to the right.

305
00:11:50,536 --> 00:11:53,453
How President Trump betrays workers

306
00:11:54,578 --> 00:11:58,058
and utters racist anti-Semitic rhetoric.

307
00:11:58,058 --> 00:12:00,070
And nobody in their party calls him out.

308
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,090
They don't have divisions.

309
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:04,210
They've all followed his racist actions

310
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:05,544
and betrayal of workers.

311
00:12:05,544 --> 00:12:07,898
They've followed it like
lemmings off the cliff.

312
00:12:07,898 --> 00:12:11,126
That's the story, not some
degrees of differences

313
00:12:11,126 --> 00:12:12,670
between and among Democrats.

314
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,503
That's the real story.

315
00:12:13,503 --> 00:12:14,823
- Let me ask you this,
though, what is fair game?

316
00:12:14,823 --> 00:12:18,162
You, in that interview,
had said, hey, in 1996,

317
00:12:18,162 --> 00:12:21,374
essentially, when it wasn't
a popular thing to do,

318
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:25,001
you voted against the Defense
of Marriage Act, for instance.

319
00:12:25,001 --> 00:12:26,860
Joe Biden has comments about busing

320
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:30,716
and desegregation of
schools that are popping up,

321
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:32,518
some quotes from him in the '70s.

322
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:33,351
You could make an argument,

323
00:12:33,351 --> 00:12:36,042
that was the mainstream,
Democratic Party position,

324
00:12:36,042 --> 00:12:38,458
perhaps, in the '70s.

325
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:41,294
Should those comments
matter to voters in Iowa,

326
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:44,534
to Democrats in Iowa, in the 21st century?

327
00:12:44,534 --> 00:12:46,286
- Well, it doesn't really
matter what Chuck Todd

328
00:12:46,286 --> 00:12:48,289
or Sherrod Brown thinks
about whether they matter

329
00:12:48,289 --> 00:12:49,122
to voters in Iowa.

330
00:12:49,122 --> 00:12:50,721
- Do they matter to you?

331
00:12:50,721 --> 00:12:54,012
- Well, it matters, records matter to me.

332
00:12:54,012 --> 00:12:57,960
The candidate that is
talking, I mean, I go back to,

333
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,952
what are they going to do
about talking to workers

334
00:12:59,952 --> 00:13:00,944
and the dignity of work?

335
00:13:00,944 --> 00:13:02,488
I want to see dignity of work

336
00:13:02,488 --> 00:13:05,652
not just part of this
campaign, not just a slogan,

337
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:07,509
not just who these candidates,

338
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:08,342
what these candidates talk about.

339
00:13:08,342 --> 00:13:09,779
I want to make sure they govern

340
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:11,352
based on the dignity of work.

341
00:13:11,352 --> 00:13:14,471
And, and so regardless of
the kind of work you do,

342
00:13:14,471 --> 00:13:16,616
whether it's about wages,
it's about benefits,

343
00:13:16,616 --> 00:13:19,676
it's about workplace safety,
it's about childcare.

344
00:13:19,676 --> 00:13:24,676
In Nevada, in the Culinary
Workers Union Hall in Las Vegas,

345
00:13:24,764 --> 00:13:26,684
Connie and I were there
three or four weeks ago,

346
00:13:26,684 --> 00:13:30,164
their slogan is, one job should be enough.

347
00:13:30,164 --> 00:13:32,068
I want to hear workers
start talking about that,

348
00:13:32,068 --> 00:13:34,616
that one living wage job should be enough,

349
00:13:34,616 --> 00:13:39,341
with healthcare, with
retirement, with childcare,

350
00:13:39,341 --> 00:13:41,052
with safety in the workplace.

351
00:13:41,052 --> 00:13:43,392
That's everything to me in this race,

352
00:13:43,392 --> 00:13:45,344
and that's a winning message.

353
00:13:45,344 --> 00:13:48,070
And it's the way we should
govern, starting in 2021.

354
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,676
- Senator, I'm going to
close with the same question

355
00:13:49,676 --> 00:13:50,509
I asked you at the beginning.

356
00:13:50,509 --> 00:13:53,125
I still didn't really hear an
answer for why you didn't run.

357
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,856
Is it simply you didn't want to do it?

358
00:13:55,856 --> 00:14:00,296
- I think we were successful
in moving forward, as we have.

359
00:14:00,296 --> 00:14:03,970
You know I was talking to
some people about this.

360
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:06,224
And you know, you can
run three different ways.

361
00:14:06,224 --> 00:14:08,472
You can run as Eeyore, where
you get up every day and,

362
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,192
oh my god, I gotta to do this.

363
00:14:10,192 --> 00:14:11,597
And I didn't want to be that.

364
00:14:11,597 --> 00:14:13,132
You can run as the angry candidate.

365
00:14:13,132 --> 00:14:14,031
I didn't want to be that.

366
00:14:14,031 --> 00:14:18,772
Or you can run as the sort of
optimist, joyful candidate,

367
00:14:18,772 --> 00:14:20,854
the way I try to do my job in the Senate.

368
00:14:20,854 --> 00:14:22,760
I think I can do that
better in the Senate,

369
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,876
in continuing to inform
this presidential race.

370
00:14:24,876 --> 00:14:26,230
- Senator, you're saying you can't

371
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,345
run for president joyfully.

372
00:14:28,345 --> 00:14:31,706
That's quite the, that's
what I just heard.

373
00:14:31,706 --> 00:14:33,100
Sorry I mean that's--
- I think I can do it,

374
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,906
I think I can do it better in the Senate.

375
00:14:34,906 --> 00:14:35,739
- Fair enough.

376
00:14:35,739 --> 00:14:36,572
- Leave it at that, Chuck.

377
00:14:36,572 --> 00:14:37,638
- Senator Sherrod Brown.

378
00:14:37,638 --> 00:14:39,933
- Your show, it's always
joyful, being on your show.

379
00:14:39,933 --> 00:14:40,927
- Well, that, I appreciate.

380
00:14:40,927 --> 00:14:42,727
It's Sunday morning, cup of coffee,

381
00:14:42,727 --> 00:14:43,832
and you've sprung forward.

382
00:14:43,832 --> 00:14:46,087
That, I appreciate.
- Even when the time changes,

383
00:14:46,087 --> 00:14:47,915
and you make me get up an hour earlier.

384
00:14:47,915 --> 00:14:48,748
- Senator, I will leave it there.

385
00:14:48,748 --> 00:14:50,115
- And then you broadcast it later.

386
00:14:50,115 --> 00:14:52,897
And people don't know how
early we got up so, on Sunday.

387
00:14:52,897 --> 00:14:54,105
Anyway, thank you, Chuck.
- Man,

388
00:14:54,105 --> 00:14:56,521
you and your Ohio colleague
John Kasich, man, you guys,

389
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:58,629
you guys know how to

390
00:14:58,629 --> 00:15:00,125
talk to your Ohio voters.

391
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,457
Thank you, sir.
- All right thanks.

392
00:15:01,457 --> 00:15:02,290
- Much appreciated.

393
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:03,229
- Joining me now is the chair

394
00:15:03,229 --> 00:15:04,540
of the House Republican Conference,

395
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,797
Liz Cheney of Wyoming.

396
00:15:05,797 --> 00:15:08,108
Congresswoman Cheney, welcome
back to Meet the Press.

397
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:09,529
- Thank you, Todd, great
to be back with you.

398
00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:10,937
- I want to start with

399
00:15:10,937 --> 00:15:13,341
what happened in the House this week

400
00:15:13,341 --> 00:15:14,721
because it was a bit of a surprise.

401
00:15:14,721 --> 00:15:18,321
You voted against this broad resolution.

402
00:15:18,321 --> 00:15:19,897
And while your criticism of the resolution

403
00:15:19,897 --> 00:15:22,169
I totally understand, but
you were in the minority

404
00:15:22,169 --> 00:15:23,336
in your party.

405
00:15:24,785 --> 00:15:26,301
Did your fellow House Republicans

406
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:28,101
make a mistake by voting
with the Democrats

407
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:28,934
on this resolution?

408
00:15:28,934 --> 00:15:30,349
- No, look, I think
that there were two ways

409
00:15:30,349 --> 00:15:31,182
we could have gone.

410
00:15:31,182 --> 00:15:32,405
Some of the people in our conference

411
00:15:32,405 --> 00:15:33,532
clearly looked at it and said,

412
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:35,615
there's nothing objectionable
in the resolution.

413
00:15:35,615 --> 00:15:38,438
My statement made clear that
that was my view as well.

414
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:39,829
But I decided to vote against it

415
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:41,338
because I think it was
really clearly an effort

416
00:15:41,338 --> 00:15:43,378
to actually protect Ilhan Omar,

417
00:15:43,378 --> 00:15:45,790
to cover up her bigotry and anti-Semitism

418
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,283
by refusing to name her.

419
00:15:47,283 --> 00:15:49,247
The Democrats have yet to take any action

420
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,016
to remove her from her committee.

421
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:52,203
And they've got a real problem.

422
00:15:52,203 --> 00:15:53,855
I mean, the extent to which they are now

423
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,355
abiding by anti-Semitism,

424
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:57,587
enabling anti-Semitism in their party

425
00:15:57,587 --> 00:15:59,747
is something we watched them struggle with

426
00:15:59,747 --> 00:16:01,487
but something that's very
dangerous for the country.

427
00:16:01,487 --> 00:16:03,227
So I'm hopeful that they will be able

428
00:16:03,227 --> 00:16:05,315
to stand up and do the
right thing on this.

429
00:16:05,315 --> 00:16:07,211
- I am curious, there
was a bit of criticism.

430
00:16:07,211 --> 00:16:10,079
Politico noted their "Republican
sources were quite peeved

431
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:10,912
"at Cheney," referring to you,

432
00:16:10,912 --> 00:16:11,745
"to say the least.

433
00:16:11,745 --> 00:16:13,656
"The thinking among most
top Republicans is this.

434
00:16:13,656 --> 00:16:15,282
"When you're part of a leadership team,

435
00:16:15,282 --> 00:16:16,646
"you stick together, period."

436
00:16:16,646 --> 00:16:19,698
Criticism being since you're
a member of leadership,

437
00:16:19,698 --> 00:16:21,514
that you should have
spoken with one voice.

438
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:22,553
- Well, look, I think that, you know,

439
00:16:22,553 --> 00:16:23,466
you know how the Hill works.

440
00:16:23,466 --> 00:16:25,777
There are always those anonymous sources

441
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:26,798
who are out there sniping.

442
00:16:26,798 --> 00:16:29,410
But I think the important
thing for us to be focused on

443
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,561
and to remember,

444
00:16:30,561 --> 00:16:32,078
the Democrats have been in charge now

445
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:33,787
for about two and a half
months in the House.

446
00:16:33,787 --> 00:16:36,129
And in that time they've become
the party of anti-Semitism,

447
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:39,134
the party of infanticide,
the party of socialism.

448
00:16:39,134 --> 00:16:40,618
They've passed legislation that's violated

449
00:16:40,618 --> 00:16:42,462
the First Amendment, the Second Amendment.

450
00:16:42,462 --> 00:16:43,931
It's really time for the Democrats,

451
00:16:43,931 --> 00:16:46,962
the leadership in that party
to stop it, to stand up,

452
00:16:46,962 --> 00:16:49,076
and to act worthy frankly of the trust

453
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:50,606
the American people have placed in them.

454
00:16:50,606 --> 00:16:51,778
It's crucial for the nation.

455
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:53,246
- I want to unpack a couple
things you just said there.

456
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:55,694
First on the issue of, you said you think

457
00:16:55,694 --> 00:16:57,522
Congresswoman Omar should lose
her committee assignments.

458
00:16:57,522 --> 00:16:59,698
You led the fight to get
Congressman Steve King,

459
00:16:59,698 --> 00:17:00,674
a Republican,

460
00:17:00,674 --> 00:17:02,810
to have him stripped of
his committee assignment.

461
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:03,643
Let me ask you this.

462
00:17:03,643 --> 00:17:06,667
Why is this, why should
congressional leaders do that?

463
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:08,922
If the voters are going
to send these folks,

464
00:17:08,922 --> 00:17:11,652
the voters in western
Iowa know Steve King,

465
00:17:11,652 --> 00:17:12,838
for better or for worse.

466
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:14,562
And the voters in Minnesota knew,

467
00:17:14,562 --> 00:17:18,729
her comments were very,
very much well publicized.

468
00:17:20,562 --> 00:17:22,106
If they send them there,

469
00:17:22,106 --> 00:17:25,225
should congressional
leaders really be stripping,

470
00:17:25,225 --> 00:17:26,606
not allowing them on committees?

471
00:17:26,606 --> 00:17:27,896
- Yeah, you know, I think the point is

472
00:17:27,896 --> 00:17:29,082
voters send them there.

473
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:30,989
Nobody is saying we're
going to expel them.

474
00:17:30,989 --> 00:17:33,103
We respect the decision
the voters have made.

475
00:17:33,103 --> 00:17:34,350
But there are certain things

476
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,996
that shouldn't be part
of our public discourse.

477
00:17:35,996 --> 00:17:37,470
White supremacy is one of those.

478
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:41,174
And anti-Semitism, the history in terms of

479
00:17:41,174 --> 00:17:43,167
what happens when you
don't stand up to the evil,

480
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,236
the history in terms of how quickly

481
00:17:45,236 --> 00:17:47,521
words turn into something
much more horrible

482
00:17:47,521 --> 00:17:49,125
when it comes to anti-Semitism,

483
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,913
as a nation we must at
all times stand up to it.

484
00:17:51,913 --> 00:17:53,366
And the kind of anti-Semitism

485
00:17:53,366 --> 00:17:55,393
that you're seeing now from Ilhan Omar

486
00:17:55,393 --> 00:17:57,241
and that has been
supported by her colleagues

487
00:17:57,241 --> 00:17:58,621
is the kind of anti-Semitism

488
00:17:58,621 --> 00:18:00,749
that really has the ability to creep in

489
00:18:00,749 --> 00:18:02,521
and become normalized in our discourse.

490
00:18:02,521 --> 00:18:05,161
And we have an absolute
obligation not to let that happen.

491
00:18:05,161 --> 00:18:06,433
- Well, there's actually anti-Semitism

492
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:07,665
that has crept into our discourse.

493
00:18:07,665 --> 00:18:09,465
Look at George Soros, okay?

494
00:18:09,465 --> 00:18:11,289
The Republican and conservative attacks

495
00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:12,525
on George Soros over the years.

496
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:14,581
In fact, Kevin McCarthy
had to pull one tweet

497
00:18:14,581 --> 00:18:16,724
that implied that he was essentially

498
00:18:16,724 --> 00:18:18,929
trying to buy this or buy that.

499
00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:20,905
That's gotten mainstreamed
in ways for years

500
00:18:20,905 --> 00:18:23,570
to the point where
George Soros had some guy

501
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,073
that was trying to pipe bomb him.

502
00:18:26,073 --> 00:18:27,107
This whataboutism.
- No, no, no, no.

503
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:28,337
- Can I just say that Congresswoman

504
00:18:28,337 --> 00:18:29,170
this whataboutism.
- Whataboutism, yeah no.

505
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:32,145
- That everybody tries to
point to the other side.

506
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:33,344
- Chuck, Chuck.

507
00:18:33,344 --> 00:18:34,177
- And it's getting a little old.

508
00:18:34,177 --> 00:18:36,560
- The whataboutism
absolutely should not go on.

509
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,523
And everyone, including Leader McCarthy,

510
00:18:38,523 --> 00:18:41,685
has stood up absolutely firmly
to condemn anti-Semitism.

511
00:18:41,685 --> 00:18:44,189
The thing that people need
to be focused on here though

512
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:46,665
is that the Democrats in
the House of Representatives

513
00:18:46,665 --> 00:18:48,942
and even some of the Democrats themselves

514
00:18:48,942 --> 00:18:52,047
are completely frustrated with the fact

515
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,578
that the leadership is,
they are protecting her.

516
00:18:54,578 --> 00:18:56,201
You know, this isn't just being silent.

517
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:57,309
They are protecting her

518
00:18:57,309 --> 00:18:59,259
by failing to put a
resolution on the floor

519
00:18:59,259 --> 00:19:02,080
that names her and that strips
of her committee assignment.

520
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,581
Instead, they put a
resolution on the floor

521
00:19:03,581 --> 00:19:05,517
which she then went out and said,

522
00:19:05,517 --> 00:19:07,345
"This is a tremendous victory for me."

523
00:19:07,345 --> 00:19:10,521
Now if we are not going to be
in a position where you say

524
00:19:10,521 --> 00:19:12,279
the kind of language that she has said

525
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:15,565
again, and again, and again
is absolutely unacceptable

526
00:19:15,565 --> 00:19:18,009
and has no place in our discourse, then,

527
00:19:18,009 --> 00:19:20,575
then those people who won't
condemn it are enabling it.

528
00:19:20,575 --> 00:19:22,197
- There was concern by singling her out

529
00:19:22,197 --> 00:19:23,905
you only make her a
target and they pointed

530
00:19:23,905 --> 00:19:26,337
to that West Virginia
Republican Party flier.

531
00:19:26,337 --> 00:19:27,630
- Chuck, I'm sorry, but you don't.

532
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:28,646
- This is getting, but my point is

533
00:19:28,646 --> 00:19:30,314
we are getting--
- You can describe it

534
00:19:30,314 --> 00:19:31,147
that way, Chuck.

535
00:19:31,147 --> 00:19:32,298
You can describe it that way
- A very dangerous way though,

536
00:19:32,298 --> 00:19:33,518
if we do it.
- But you're wrong.

537
00:19:33,518 --> 00:19:34,864
- You can describe it that
way but you are wrong.

538
00:19:34,864 --> 00:19:36,830
When you have a situation in this country

539
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,316
and around the world where we have seen

540
00:19:38,316 --> 00:19:40,766
a global rise in anti-Semitic attacks,

541
00:19:40,766 --> 00:19:42,190
when we have had the kinds of attacks

542
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,127
that you had on the synagogue

543
00:19:43,127 --> 00:19:45,246
here in the United States recently,

544
00:19:45,246 --> 00:19:46,698
that is a moment when you absolutely--

545
00:19:46,698 --> 00:19:47,838
- A motive on the right.

546
00:19:47,838 --> 00:19:48,796
That guy was motivated by right-wing

547
00:19:48,796 --> 00:19:51,296
fringe ideology.
- Absolutely was anti-Semitic.

548
00:19:51,296 --> 00:19:52,129
- [Chuck] Right.

549
00:19:52,129 --> 00:19:54,524
- Anti-Semitic no matter
where it comes from is wrong.

550
00:19:54,524 --> 00:19:55,768
And when you're in a situation

551
00:19:55,768 --> 00:19:57,430
where you are an elected official,

552
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,460
where we are in a situation where we have

553
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,556
the history that we have,

554
00:19:59,556 --> 00:20:01,940
what happens when you
don't stand up and say,

555
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,160
this is evil, and call it what it is,

556
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,824
we all have an obligation to do that.

557
00:20:05,824 --> 00:20:09,064
And I think it is absolutely
shameful that Nancy Pelosi,

558
00:20:09,064 --> 00:20:11,164
and Leader Hoyer, and
the Democratic leaders

559
00:20:11,164 --> 00:20:14,104
will not put her name in
a resolution on the floor,

560
00:20:14,104 --> 00:20:15,336
and condemn her remarks,

561
00:20:15,336 --> 00:20:17,342
and remove her from the House
Foreign Affairs Committee.

562
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:18,576
- Do you feel comfortable
that President Trump's

563
00:20:18,576 --> 00:20:20,900
done enough to tamp down
this right-wing fringe

564
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,552
anti-Semitism that's been rising up?

565
00:20:22,552 --> 00:20:24,361
- I don't believe this is right or left.

566
00:20:24,361 --> 00:20:25,984
I think that this is an issue on which

567
00:20:25,984 --> 00:20:27,468
all of us should come together,

568
00:20:27,468 --> 00:20:29,524
particularly elected
officials, the president,

569
00:20:29,524 --> 00:20:30,992
the vice president, members of the Senate

570
00:20:30,992 --> 00:20:33,288
and the House no matter
what your party is.

571
00:20:33,288 --> 00:20:35,485
Stand up and say in today's world

572
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:37,908
when anti-Semitism is on the rise,

573
00:20:37,908 --> 00:20:39,456
when we have the history that we have,

574
00:20:39,456 --> 00:20:41,659
when we know what happens
when people remain silent,

575
00:20:41,659 --> 00:20:44,928
every single one of us must
at all times stand against it.

576
00:20:44,928 --> 00:20:46,141
- There's a couple of
foreign policy headlines

577
00:20:46,141 --> 00:20:46,986
I wanted to get at you.

578
00:20:46,986 --> 00:20:51,819
First, this was the president
on Friday about North Korea.

579
00:20:52,849 --> 00:20:54,930
- I have a feeling that

580
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:58,814
our relationship with North
Korea, Kim Jong-un and myself,

581
00:20:58,814 --> 00:21:01,469
Chairman Kim, I think
it's a very good one.

582
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,062
I think it remains good.

583
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:06,552
I would be surprised in a negative way

584
00:21:06,552 --> 00:21:08,774
if he did anything that was

585
00:21:08,774 --> 00:21:11,746
not per our understanding.

586
00:21:11,746 --> 00:21:13,452
- This is what we've
learned just this week.

587
00:21:13,452 --> 00:21:15,242
He's accelerating the
rocket program again.

588
00:21:15,242 --> 00:21:17,762
He's enriched more uranium
between the two summits.

589
00:21:17,762 --> 00:21:18,995
And more importantly,

590
00:21:18,995 --> 00:21:20,608
they were reconstituting the programs

591
00:21:20,608 --> 00:21:23,762
while the second summit was taking place.

592
00:21:23,762 --> 00:21:25,022
- Yeah.
- With the president there.

593
00:21:25,022 --> 00:21:27,002
You can't take him at his
word on this, can you?

594
00:21:27,002 --> 00:21:29,686
- We have watched Kim
Jong-un, and his father,

595
00:21:29,686 --> 00:21:32,988
and his grandfather operate
the same way now for decades.

596
00:21:32,988 --> 00:21:34,460
And I would say that Republican

597
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,412
and Democratic administrations
got taken by him.

598
00:21:37,412 --> 00:21:38,584
I hope this president won't.

599
00:21:38,584 --> 00:21:40,960
I think that, you know, their
efforts are absolutely clear.

600
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,055
- Hasn't he already gotten
more out of this president

601
00:21:43,055 --> 00:21:43,888
by simply getting respect

602
00:21:43,888 --> 00:21:44,728
on the world stage?
- No, you know what,

603
00:21:44,728 --> 00:21:45,971
I think the fact that the president

604
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,651
walked away from the summit in Vietnam

605
00:21:47,651 --> 00:21:48,808
is a very positive thing.

606
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,307
I think that that was
the right thing to do.

607
00:21:50,307 --> 00:21:52,348
We don't want a bad deal
that makes us less safe.

608
00:21:52,348 --> 00:21:53,412
- And before I let you go,

609
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:54,656
the president's going
to roll out a budget,

610
00:21:54,656 --> 00:21:56,684
and there's going to be something in there

611
00:21:56,684 --> 00:21:58,332
that's going to be quite
alarming to some allies.

612
00:21:58,332 --> 00:22:00,404
The president's going to advocate perhaps

613
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:02,156
wherever we have troops overseas,

614
00:22:02,156 --> 00:22:04,736
think Japan, South Korea, Germany

615
00:22:04,736 --> 00:22:07,692
he's going to ask for cost plus fifty.

616
00:22:07,692 --> 00:22:09,775
Essentially tax countries

617
00:22:10,766 --> 00:22:13,064
over and above where we have bases.

618
00:22:13,064 --> 00:22:15,293
What does that do to the
diplomacy for this country?

619
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:17,396
- I think it would be
absolutely devastating.

620
00:22:17,396 --> 00:22:18,792
We benefit tremendously.

621
00:22:18,792 --> 00:22:20,232
If you look at the last 70 years,

622
00:22:20,232 --> 00:22:21,521
we have been able to benefit both

623
00:22:21,521 --> 00:22:24,146
from the perspective
of freedom, prosperity,

624
00:22:24,146 --> 00:22:26,384
security, safety because of our bases

625
00:22:26,384 --> 00:22:28,244
and our cooperation with our allies.

626
00:22:28,244 --> 00:22:30,075
The notion that we are somehow
now going to charge them

627
00:22:30,075 --> 00:22:33,688
cost plus fifty, is
really it's wrongheaded

628
00:22:33,688 --> 00:22:35,728
and it would be devastating
to the security of the nation

629
00:22:35,728 --> 00:22:36,868
and our allies.
- Do you think

630
00:22:36,868 --> 00:22:38,770
your Republican Party will support this?

631
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,303
- I won't.

632
00:22:40,303 --> 00:22:41,816
- [Chuck] But the party might.

633
00:22:41,816 --> 00:22:43,701
- Well, I think it's
going to be very important

634
00:22:43,701 --> 00:22:46,136
for us to make sure that people
understand the danger that

635
00:22:46,136 --> 00:22:47,380
that will do to our relationships

636
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,940
and to our fundamental security.

637
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,680
Our security, we've
been able to protect it

638
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,720
because of our alliances
and because we've been able

639
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,712
to work with countries.

640
00:22:53,712 --> 00:22:55,780
And we should not look
at this as though somehow

641
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:59,020
we need to charge them
rent or for the privilege

642
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,504
of having our forces there

643
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:03,536
because that does us a
huge benefit as well.

644
00:23:03,536 --> 00:23:05,020
- Congresswoman Liz Cheney,
Republican from Wyoming,

645
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:05,853
thanks for coming on.

646
00:23:05,853 --> 00:23:06,686
- Thank you, Chuck, good to be with you.

647
00:23:06,686 --> 00:23:07,519
- Good to see you here.

648
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:08,352
When we come back,

649
00:23:08,352 --> 00:23:10,274
Democrats are going through
the same growing pains

650
00:23:10,274 --> 00:23:12,920
Republicans did when
the Tea Party emerged.

651
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,527
It's hard to keep
competing factions happy.

652
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:18,648
That and the waiting for Biden campaign.

653
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:20,148
The panel is next.

654
00:23:24,423 --> 00:23:25,753
(water splashing)

655
00:23:25,753 --> 00:23:26,847
- [Announcer] Guys do whatever it takes

656
00:23:26,847 --> 00:23:28,986
to deal with shave irritation.

657
00:23:28,986 --> 00:23:33,359
So we reimagined the razor with
the new Gillette skin guard.

658
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:36,428
It has a unique guard between the blades

659
00:23:36,428 --> 00:23:41,091
that's designed to reduce
irritation during the shave.

660
00:23:41,091 --> 00:23:45,841
Because we believe all men
deserve a razor just for them.

661
00:23:47,475 --> 00:23:49,392
The best a man can get.

662
00:23:50,243 --> 00:23:51,076
Gillette.

663
00:23:53,072 --> 00:23:56,078
- [Announcer] This is Golden
Corral's hand-cut sirloin,

664
00:23:56,078 --> 00:23:58,275
now topped with delicious shrimp scampi.

665
00:23:58,275 --> 00:24:00,224
And here's the premium butterfly shrimp,

666
00:24:00,224 --> 00:24:02,254
and the teriyaki salmon.

667
00:24:02,254 --> 00:24:04,994
Get it all, plus the entire
buffet for one low price.

668
00:24:04,994 --> 00:24:08,085
There's something for
everyone at Golden Corral.

669
00:24:08,085 --> 00:24:09,195
(gentle music)

670
00:24:09,195 --> 00:24:10,737
- [Announcer] In Key West,

671
00:24:10,737 --> 00:24:13,070
you can get close to nature.

672
00:24:19,234 --> 00:24:20,651
Close to history.

673
00:24:25,686 --> 00:24:28,103
And really close to the band.

674
00:24:29,355 --> 00:24:32,897
In fact, Key West is close to perfect,

675
00:24:32,897 --> 00:24:34,564
but far from normal.

676
00:24:37,983 --> 00:24:40,447
- [Reader] If you want to
know why people sacrifice

677
00:24:40,447 --> 00:24:42,717
everything for love you have to start

678
00:24:42,717 --> 00:24:44,186
by asking--
- Could listening to audible

679
00:24:44,186 --> 00:24:46,578
help you find the secret
to a stronger relationship?

680
00:24:46,578 --> 00:24:48,067
- [Reader] Sometimes it
doesn't take anything at all

681
00:24:48,067 --> 00:24:49,642
for us to--
- Just say, Alexa,

682
00:24:49,642 --> 00:24:51,267
give me my free audible book,

683
00:24:51,267 --> 00:24:53,066
and your first pick is on us.

684
00:24:53,066 --> 00:24:55,297
- To the first teacher
who took me seriously.

685
00:24:55,297 --> 00:24:57,371
- To the professor who
pulled me aside and said,

686
00:24:57,371 --> 00:24:58,204
you got this.

687
00:24:58,204 --> 00:24:59,909
- To the pilots who let me in the cockpit,

688
00:24:59,909 --> 00:25:01,819
but didn't let me touch anything.

689
00:25:01,819 --> 00:25:02,652
(robot whirs)

690
00:25:02,652 --> 00:25:03,824
- To Grace Hopper.

691
00:25:03,824 --> 00:25:04,872
- To Mae Jemison.

692
00:25:04,872 --> 00:25:06,234
- To Miss Frizzle.

693
00:25:06,234 --> 00:25:07,067
What?

694
00:25:07,067 --> 00:25:07,900
- To Mrs. Schweinke.

695
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,733
- To my aunt.

696
00:25:08,733 --> 00:25:09,566
(speaking foreign language)

697
00:25:09,566 --> 00:25:10,399
- To whoever comes after me.

698
00:25:10,399 --> 00:25:11,833
- Let me help show you the way.

699
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:13,483
- [Man] When more girls go into STEM,

700
00:25:13,483 --> 00:25:15,096
the whole world benefits.

701
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:17,348
- Thank the role model who inspired you.

702
00:25:17,348 --> 00:25:18,356
- Thank you.

703
00:25:18,356 --> 00:25:19,605
(speaking foreign language)

704
00:25:19,605 --> 00:25:21,555
- [Man] Create your own thank you.

705
00:25:21,555 --> 00:25:23,638
- CoQ10 is the number on
cardiologist-recommended

706
00:25:23,638 --> 00:25:25,363
supplement for heart health.

707
00:25:25,363 --> 00:25:27,502
I take Qunol CoQ10.

708
00:25:27,502 --> 00:25:28,372
Why?

709
00:25:28,372 --> 00:25:30,388
Because Qunol has three
times better absorption

710
00:25:30,388 --> 00:25:32,587
than regular CoQ10.

711
00:25:32,587 --> 00:25:34,587
Qunol, the better CoQ10.

712
00:25:36,174 --> 00:25:37,318
- [Announcer] Allergy sufferers,

713
00:25:37,318 --> 00:25:40,554
your senses of smell, hearing,
and taste are being censored.

714
00:25:40,554 --> 00:25:42,290
Dulled by allergy congestion.

715
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,226
Regain your senses with Nasacort.

716
00:25:44,226 --> 00:25:45,865
It's more effective than anti-histamines

717
00:25:45,865 --> 00:25:48,523
on your worst nasal symptoms,
including congestion.

718
00:25:48,523 --> 00:25:50,828
Nasacort, live unsensored.

719
00:25:50,828 --> 00:25:52,127
- When I was playing ball,

720
00:25:52,127 --> 00:25:53,639
they called me The Big Hurt.

721
00:25:53,639 --> 00:25:54,957
But now that I left the game,

722
00:25:54,957 --> 00:25:57,279
Mother Nature started
putting a big hurt on me.

723
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,115
I just couldn't stay in
shape like I used to.

724
00:25:59,115 --> 00:26:01,788
But luckily I found out about Nugenix.

725
00:26:01,788 --> 00:26:03,666
- [Announcer] Nugenix is a
unique man-boosting formula

726
00:26:03,666 --> 00:26:05,947
that helps increase your
free testosterone levels.

727
00:26:05,947 --> 00:26:07,085
- [Frank] Thanks to Nugenix,

728
00:26:07,085 --> 00:26:08,791
I'm really getting after it again.

729
00:26:08,791 --> 00:26:10,040
- [Announcer] Feel stronger, leaner,

730
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,340
with more energy and drive.

731
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,920
- She'll like the difference too.

732
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,824
- [Announcer] To get a
complementary bottle text Flash,

733
00:26:14,824 --> 00:26:19,574
to 369369, that's F-L-A-S-H, to 369369.

734
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:23,150
- [Announcer] At HomeLight.com

735
00:26:24,511 --> 00:26:26,096
- Welcome back, panel
is here, Pat McCrory,

736
00:26:26,096 --> 00:26:27,862
the former Republican
Governor of North Carolina.

737
00:26:27,862 --> 00:26:30,157
María Teresa Kumar,
President of Voto Latino.

738
00:26:30,157 --> 00:26:32,383
Kasie Hunt, NBC News
Capitol Hill correspondent

739
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:33,810
and host of Kasie DC on MSNBC.

740
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:34,875
And Robert Costa,

741
00:26:34,875 --> 00:26:37,885
the moderator of Washington Week on PBS.

742
00:26:37,885 --> 00:26:39,621
Kasie, let's unpack, first, the Hill,

743
00:26:39,621 --> 00:26:41,008
before we get to the presidential race.

744
00:26:41,008 --> 00:26:43,024
Because the Hill debate is going

745
00:26:43,024 --> 00:26:44,913
to animate the presidential race.

746
00:26:44,913 --> 00:26:48,746
Let me play Nancy Pelosi
on Omar, from Friday.

747
00:26:50,722 --> 00:26:52,555
- The incident that happened was,

748
00:26:52,555 --> 00:26:55,760
I don't think our
colleague is anti-Semitic.

749
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,008
I think she has a different
experience in the use of words,

750
00:26:59,008 --> 00:27:01,878
doesn't understand that
some of them are fraught

751
00:27:01,878 --> 00:27:04,301
with meaning that she didn't realize

752
00:27:04,301 --> 00:27:07,718
but, nonetheless, that we had to address.

753
00:27:08,866 --> 00:27:09,699
- I will say this,

754
00:27:09,699 --> 00:27:11,398
Speaker Pelosi has given
me my new favorite excuse.

755
00:27:11,398 --> 00:27:13,958
She has a different experience
in the use of words.

756
00:27:13,958 --> 00:27:16,146
That is easily, now, going to be one of my

757
00:27:16,146 --> 00:27:17,896
favorite new phrases.

758
00:27:19,244 --> 00:27:20,814
This is not easy.

759
00:27:20,814 --> 00:27:21,974
- It's not easy, Chuck.

760
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:24,542
I think the one thing,
when you speak with,

761
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:26,629
you know, members of the Democratic Party,

762
00:27:26,629 --> 00:27:29,778
who are frustrated with how
their own party handled this,

763
00:27:29,778 --> 00:27:32,102
there are a lot of Jewish and
non-Jewish Democrats, frankly,

764
00:27:32,102 --> 00:27:35,042
who are upset that this
resolution was as broad as it was.

765
00:27:35,042 --> 00:27:36,878
You know, they'll say,
this is the third time

766
00:27:36,878 --> 00:27:37,836
this has happened.

767
00:27:37,836 --> 00:27:40,816
You know, she said Israel
was hypnotizing the world,

768
00:27:40,816 --> 00:27:43,014
in a tweet before she was in office.

769
00:27:43,014 --> 00:27:44,638
She had that, you know, Benjamins tweet

770
00:27:44,638 --> 00:27:46,852
you showed the audience
at the top of the show.

771
00:27:46,852 --> 00:27:48,072
And now, she had this.

772
00:27:48,072 --> 00:27:50,450
And so you know, every single time,

773
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:53,026
she has pled ignorance of these tropes.

774
00:27:53,026 --> 00:27:54,411
But you know, they're tropes for a reason.

775
00:27:54,411 --> 00:27:56,048
She's picking up on, you know, language

776
00:27:56,048 --> 00:27:59,313
that is used that is
anti-Semitic, quite frankly.

777
00:27:59,313 --> 00:28:03,080
So you know, I think Nancy Pelosi is doing

778
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,387
what she has very
carefully done since this

779
00:28:05,387 --> 00:28:07,386
new caucus has come together,

780
00:28:07,386 --> 00:28:09,977
which is try to very
carefully thread that needle

781
00:28:09,977 --> 00:28:12,596
and try to sew these two
very disparate generations

782
00:28:12,596 --> 00:28:14,048
together and it's getting harder.

783
00:28:14,048 --> 00:28:16,930
- But there's only so much
Speaker Pelosi can do.

784
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:19,577
I met with some House
Democrats, seasoned veterans,

785
00:28:19,577 --> 00:28:21,354
over the weekend and late last week.

786
00:28:21,354 --> 00:28:24,027
And they said, in this day
and age of social media,

787
00:28:24,027 --> 00:28:25,401
where someone like Representative Omar

788
00:28:25,401 --> 00:28:27,231
or Representative Ocasio-Cortez

789
00:28:27,231 --> 00:28:28,873
can have millions of followers,

790
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:31,375
that the old rules don't apply.

791
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:34,320
And so Speaker Pelosi may try
to cobble together legislation

792
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,981
to send a message to voters.

793
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:38,154
But the people who have political capital

794
00:28:38,154 --> 00:28:42,802
inside this party are those
with a social media following.

795
00:28:42,802 --> 00:28:46,369
- Okay, if you get off social
media, the world looks normal.

796
00:28:46,369 --> 00:28:47,781
- [Maria] Fairly different.

797
00:28:47,781 --> 00:28:49,945
- But if you live on social
media, I mean, you know,

798
00:28:49,945 --> 00:28:50,984
I don't mean to carry this over.

799
00:28:50,984 --> 00:28:52,761
The NBA is having a problem.

800
00:28:52,761 --> 00:28:53,922
Its players make all this money,

801
00:28:53,922 --> 00:28:55,057
and they're depressed all the time,

802
00:28:55,057 --> 00:28:56,279
because they live on social media

803
00:28:56,279 --> 00:29:00,435
and feel every negative comment
and live it and all of this.

804
00:29:00,435 --> 00:29:02,397
This is what's happening
to this younger generation.

805
00:29:02,397 --> 00:29:03,807
- Exactly right and part of it is, too,

806
00:29:03,807 --> 00:29:04,640
that you actually don't even know

807
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,752
who is really tweeting you.

808
00:29:05,752 --> 00:29:07,871
Are they bots or are they real people,

809
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,551
when it comes to, basically, feeling this?

810
00:29:09,551 --> 00:29:11,119
And I think that the challenge is that

811
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:13,456
President Trump has really
done a fantastic job

812
00:29:13,456 --> 00:29:16,057
communicating to a broader
audience, based on his tweets.

813
00:29:16,057 --> 00:29:17,867
And it's toe to toe,
now, with a generation

814
00:29:17,867 --> 00:29:19,373
that actually expects
that they're going to have

815
00:29:19,373 --> 00:29:20,822
their breaking news not on the front page

816
00:29:20,822 --> 00:29:22,838
of The New York Times but through a tweet.

817
00:29:22,838 --> 00:29:24,272
And then you don't
actually know how to have

818
00:29:24,272 --> 00:29:26,960
the accurate literacy of,
is this actually accurate?

819
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,487
And that's a challenge.

820
00:29:28,487 --> 00:29:30,193
- As a former mayor and former governor,

821
00:29:30,193 --> 00:29:32,319
I always thought
resolutions without actions

822
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:34,046
were empty gestures.

823
00:29:34,046 --> 00:29:36,814
And this resolution was an empty gesture

824
00:29:36,814 --> 00:29:39,702
which tried to please everyone
and ended up pleasing no one.

825
00:29:39,702 --> 00:29:41,367
But the problem, for the Democrats,

826
00:29:41,367 --> 00:29:45,313
with these new Millennials, I
call them the AOC Millennials,

827
00:29:45,313 --> 00:29:47,118
is not only do the
Millennials think they have

828
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,974
all the answers they think
they already have wisdom.

829
00:29:49,974 --> 00:29:52,675
And the Nancy Pelosis of
the world have wisdom.

830
00:29:52,675 --> 00:29:54,913
And they're trying to explain
to these younger people,

831
00:29:54,913 --> 00:29:56,819
wait a minute, I'm the old person.

832
00:29:56,819 --> 00:29:58,745
And you cannot make that argument.

833
00:29:58,745 --> 00:29:59,578
- All right.

834
00:29:59,578 --> 00:30:01,683
(group argues)

835
00:30:01,683 --> 00:30:03,598
- Bring it on, there you go.

836
00:30:03,598 --> 00:30:05,097
Bring it on, Kasie.

837
00:30:05,097 --> 00:30:06,026
- I mean, honestly, I think that

838
00:30:06,026 --> 00:30:07,523
the leaders can learn something

839
00:30:07,523 --> 00:30:11,918
from the newer, I take
your point that, you know,

840
00:30:11,918 --> 00:30:14,326
they have not had the kind
of experience in government.

841
00:30:14,326 --> 00:30:15,996
And I think, to a certain extent,

842
00:30:15,996 --> 00:30:17,228
there are going to be consequences

843
00:30:17,228 --> 00:30:19,213
for some of the actions
they take on social media

844
00:30:19,213 --> 00:30:21,749
in, kind of, the universe of
trying to get things done.

845
00:30:21,749 --> 00:30:22,758
But on the other hand,

846
00:30:22,758 --> 00:30:24,338
I think the old guard
doesn't really understand

847
00:30:24,338 --> 00:30:26,018
the power of what they bring.

848
00:30:26,018 --> 00:30:28,400
- By the way, guys, I want
to insert somebody into here,

849
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,237
really quickly.

850
00:30:29,237 --> 00:30:31,323
First of all, the Times
set it up really well.

851
00:30:31,323 --> 00:30:34,123
The Times said, this is the
debate in the Democratic Party,

852
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,594
what you guys are arguing about.

853
00:30:35,594 --> 00:30:38,493
"Do Americans simply pine
for a pre-Trump equilibrium,

854
00:30:38,493 --> 00:30:40,756
"less chaos and more consensus,

855
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:42,775
"or do the yawning
disparities of these times

856
00:30:42,775 --> 00:30:45,474
call out for a more
transformational administration?"

857
00:30:45,474 --> 00:30:46,987
- [Kasie] And I think
that's absolutely valid.

858
00:30:46,987 --> 00:30:49,327
- Now, listen to AOC yesterday.

859
00:30:49,327 --> 00:30:51,523
- Pat, listen to this.
- Yeah, yeah.

860
00:30:51,523 --> 00:30:54,573
- Moderate is not a stance.

861
00:30:54,573 --> 00:30:58,573
It's just an attitude
toward life of, like, meh.

862
00:31:00,513 --> 00:31:03,930
The meh is, like, worshiped now for what?

863
00:31:05,175 --> 00:31:06,505
- I rest my case.

864
00:31:06,505 --> 00:31:09,487
But the point I want to make
is there's another issue

865
00:31:09,487 --> 00:31:11,612
that brought out the AOC Millennials

866
00:31:11,612 --> 00:31:13,600
against the traditional,
liberal Democrats.

867
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,196
That was Amazon.

868
00:31:15,196 --> 00:31:17,855
Cuomo and one of the most
liberal mayors of New York City

869
00:31:17,855 --> 00:31:20,390
we've ever had gave tax breaks

870
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:22,769
to a major multibillion-dollar company.

871
00:31:22,769 --> 00:31:24,634
AOC fought it and said, well,

872
00:31:24,634 --> 00:31:26,776
we can spend that $2 billion elsewhere.

873
00:31:26,776 --> 00:31:29,495
Well, the $2 billion didn't exist.

874
00:31:29,495 --> 00:31:31,861
She didn't have the knowledge
necessary of the economy.

875
00:31:31,861 --> 00:31:34,059
Now, philosophy, that's a good argument.

876
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:37,213
That's also showing the division
in the Democratic Party.

877
00:31:37,213 --> 00:31:39,338
- Right, but I actually
think that what Millennials

878
00:31:39,338 --> 00:31:41,175
are feeling is that they are
feeling from their experience.

879
00:31:41,175 --> 00:31:42,732
They know that something is off.

880
00:31:42,732 --> 00:31:44,777
They know that their experience of,

881
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:46,860
that they're going to have
a guaranteed brighter future

882
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,401
than their parents is
just not going to happen.

883
00:31:48,401 --> 00:31:49,234
- [Kasie] It's broken.

884
00:31:49,234 --> 00:31:50,067
- It's broken,

885
00:31:50,067 --> 00:31:50,999
and the fact that.
- The compact is broken.

886
00:31:50,999 --> 00:31:51,832
- Absolutely.

887
00:31:51,832 --> 00:31:53,187
- It used to be that if you worked hard,

888
00:31:53,187 --> 00:31:54,885
and you followed the
ethics of your parents,

889
00:31:54,885 --> 00:31:56,311
you would end up working for a company

890
00:31:56,311 --> 00:31:58,159
that would take care
of you for a long time.

891
00:31:58,159 --> 00:31:59,907
That is not the case anymore.

892
00:31:59,907 --> 00:32:01,478
It is simply not the case.

893
00:32:01,478 --> 00:32:03,068
And people resent it.
- It's bigger than age.

894
00:32:03,068 --> 00:32:05,789
I mean the point
Representative Ocasio-Cortez

895
00:32:05,789 --> 00:32:07,525
is making is that the Democratic Party

896
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:08,518
needs to move to the left.

897
00:32:08,518 --> 00:32:10,799
If you look at this
2020 presidential race,

898
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,255
where is the energy?

899
00:32:12,255 --> 00:32:14,256
Fundraising, Senator Bernie Sanders,

900
00:32:14,256 --> 00:32:16,116
crowds, Senator Bernie Sanders.

901
00:32:16,116 --> 00:32:17,829
He's in his upper 70s.

902
00:32:17,829 --> 00:32:19,983
Yet, he's the runner up from '16.

903
00:32:19,983 --> 00:32:21,133
And he's saying to people like

904
00:32:21,133 --> 00:32:22,798
the representative from New York,

905
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:24,463
I'm your type of candidate.

906
00:32:24,463 --> 00:32:27,292
I'm not a meh candidate, to use her term.

907
00:32:27,292 --> 00:32:28,140
- The Bernie-Biden, by the way,

908
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,645
it takes two 75-plus-year-old
guys, I guess,

909
00:32:30,645 --> 00:32:32,060
to have this argument,

910
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:35,372
between this generational argument here.

911
00:32:35,372 --> 00:32:36,873
By the way are they placeholders for now,

912
00:32:36,873 --> 00:32:40,847
until the younger generation
gets more grassroots support?

913
00:32:40,847 --> 00:32:41,680
- Well, I actually think

914
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,178
that everybody's waiting in
the wings, in large part,

915
00:32:44,178 --> 00:32:46,181
because they're waiting
for Beto to announce.

916
00:32:46,181 --> 00:32:48,082
And unlike all of the other Democrats

917
00:32:48,082 --> 00:32:50,650
that are trying to move
as far to the left,

918
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:53,561
to say, yeah, I am your person,
he has not, necessarily,

919
00:32:53,561 --> 00:32:54,394
said that he is.

920
00:32:54,394 --> 00:32:57,452
And he's much more palatable
to a lot of the independents.

921
00:32:57,452 --> 00:32:59,611
And he's done that in
a very interesting way.

922
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:01,556
Because again, if you ask
him where his policies are,

923
00:33:01,556 --> 00:33:02,956
they're not on the left.

924
00:33:02,956 --> 00:33:03,789
- He's all things

925
00:33:03,789 --> 00:33:04,622
to all people.
- If there's a criticism,

926
00:33:04,622 --> 00:33:05,718
right, if there's a criticism of Beto,

927
00:33:05,718 --> 00:33:07,022
it's that he doesn't know where he stands

928
00:33:07,022 --> 00:33:08,044
on a lot of things.
- But all these left-wing--

929
00:33:08,044 --> 00:33:08,877
- If you read some of those interviews.

930
00:33:08,877 --> 00:33:11,448
- All these left-wing stances,
the green plan especially,

931
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:12,651
where the Millennials
are going to realize,

932
00:33:12,651 --> 00:33:16,082
they have to have energy and
power at an affordable price.

933
00:33:16,082 --> 00:33:18,392
They're going to find
out energy is not cheap.

934
00:33:18,392 --> 00:33:20,711
And you need energy to survive.

935
00:33:20,711 --> 00:33:22,783
And the reality's going to wake them up

936
00:33:22,783 --> 00:33:23,616
sometime down the road.

937
00:33:23,616 --> 00:33:26,640
- This is a conversation
that needs more time,

938
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,119
and I might actually give it more time.

939
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:29,952
But when we come back,

940
00:33:29,952 --> 00:33:31,848
President Trump says
Michael Cohen is lying

941
00:33:31,848 --> 00:33:33,024
about asking for a pardon.

942
00:33:33,024 --> 00:33:35,686
Cohen says it's Mr. Trump who's lying.

943
00:33:35,686 --> 00:33:37,590
All right, so what does Adam Schiff think?

944
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:39,676
Because Michael Cohen
has lied to him, too.

945
00:33:39,676 --> 00:33:41,218
The chairman of the House
Intelligence Committee

946
00:33:41,218 --> 00:33:42,385
joins me next.

947
00:33:44,127 --> 00:33:46,944
- [Announcer] Think only
specialty stores have what's new?

948
00:33:46,944 --> 00:33:49,199
Olay has the hottest debut.

949
00:33:49,199 --> 00:33:51,641
New Olay clay stick masks.

950
00:33:51,641 --> 00:33:54,224
Hydrating facial mist.

951
00:33:54,224 --> 00:33:56,868
And brightening eye cream.

952
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:57,951
Only by Olay.

953
00:33:59,111 --> 00:34:00,247
- I was so embarrassed
about paying too much

954
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:02,151
for a used car, I went into hiding

962
00:34:19,854 --> 00:34:21,407
- Well I'm not quite sure.

963
00:34:21,407 --> 00:34:24,561
But I'd like to prescribe
my proprietary elixir.

964
00:34:24,561 --> 00:34:28,369
- Doctor Turner's Elixir,
as in, you Doctor Turner.

965
00:34:28,369 --> 00:34:29,202
- Yes.

966
00:34:29,202 --> 00:34:30,400

00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,289

1021
00:36:13,737 --> 00:36:15,614
- Where do you see your party right now?

1022
00:36:15,614 --> 00:36:18,426
- It's going to be, how do we
think government should work

1023
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:21,241
and who do we think
government should work for?

1024
00:36:21,241 --> 00:36:22,223
- You at the time were

1025
00:36:22,223 --> 00:36:23,791
personally opposed to the death penalty,

1026
00:36:23,791 --> 00:36:25,258
are you still?
- I've been my entire life,

1027
00:36:25,258 --> 00:36:26,091
and I still am.

1028
00:36:26,091 --> 00:36:28,674
- Would you commit to choosing a woman

1029
00:36:28,674 --> 00:36:30,272
as your vice presidential candidate?

1030
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:32,160
- You know I'll be looking to women first?

1031
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,839
- Do you have views on
whether or not US troops

1032
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:37,313
should be in Syria in
any sort of long run?

1033
00:36:37,313 --> 00:36:38,601
Does it give you a way to talk to people

1034
00:36:38,601 --> 00:36:40,253
who might be much more
conservative than you are

1035
00:36:40,253 --> 00:36:41,920
on these issues now?

1036
00:36:44,885 --> 00:36:45,718
- Welcome back.

1037
00:36:45,718 --> 00:36:46,551
This was a week in which we saw

1038
00:36:46,551 --> 00:36:48,718
President Trump's former
campaign chairman Paul Manafort

1039
00:36:48,718 --> 00:36:50,233
get sentenced to prison.

1040
00:36:50,233 --> 00:36:51,406
Think about that for a moment.

1041
00:36:51,406 --> 00:36:52,473
The man who made sure Donald Trump

1042
00:36:52,473 --> 00:36:54,813
secured the nomination at
the Republican convention

1043
00:36:54,813 --> 00:36:57,529
was sentenced to 47 months in prison,

1044
00:36:57,529 --> 00:37:00,863
with sentencing in another
case coming this week.

1045
00:37:00,863 --> 00:37:02,416
We also saw Mr. Trump
and Michael Cohen each

1046
00:37:02,416 --> 00:37:04,906
call the other a liar over
whether Cohen sought a pardon

1047
00:37:04,906 --> 00:37:05,739
from the president.

1048
00:37:05,739 --> 00:37:07,135
There's a lot to chew on.

1049
00:37:07,135 --> 00:37:08,434
We're going to turn to the chairman

1050
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:10,088
of the House Intelligence
Committee, Adam Schiff,

1051
00:37:10,088 --> 00:37:11,936
who joins me now from Los Angeles.

1052
00:37:11,936 --> 00:37:13,360
And on spring-forward day,

1053
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,036
I'm very grateful for you
getting up that extra hour early.

1054
00:37:16,036 --> 00:37:18,249
Congressman Schiff, welcome
back to Meet the Press, sir.

1055
00:37:18,249 --> 00:37:19,082
- Thank you.

1056
00:37:19,082 --> 00:37:21,286
- Let me just start with
a basic question here.

1057
00:37:21,286 --> 00:37:22,980
Who's lying, the president
or Michael Cohen,

1058
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:25,738
when it comes to whether Michael
Cohen asked for a pardon?

1059
00:37:25,738 --> 00:37:27,041
And more importantly,

1060
00:37:27,041 --> 00:37:31,200
did Michael Cohen lie to Congress again?

1061
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,366
- Well, the central question
of our investigation is:

1062
00:37:34,366 --> 00:37:36,772
Why did Michael Cohen
lie before our committee

1063
00:37:36,772 --> 00:37:38,816
about Moscow Trump Tower?

1064
00:37:38,816 --> 00:37:41,884
Why would this be in his interest?

1065
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:43,871
Was this something that he did alone

1066
00:37:43,871 --> 00:37:45,982
or were there others involved in it?

1067
00:37:45,982 --> 00:37:47,526
And there are reasons to believe

1068
00:37:47,526 --> 00:37:50,413
that this was not a lone
decision of Michael Cohen.

1069
00:37:50,413 --> 00:37:53,662
What we are looking for
is corroborative evidence.

1070
00:37:53,662 --> 00:37:54,568
And the reason why this,

1071
00:37:54,568 --> 00:37:56,111
this whole Moscow Trump Tower issue

1072
00:37:56,111 --> 00:37:58,254
is so central to our investigation is

1073
00:37:58,254 --> 00:38:02,372
that it explains or potentially explains

1074
00:38:02,372 --> 00:38:05,546
the president's bizarre
affinity for Vladimir Putin.

1075
00:38:05,546 --> 00:38:07,845
And that is that he
stood to make more money

1076
00:38:07,845 --> 00:38:10,855
from this transaction
than any deal in his life

1077
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:13,192
and sought the Kremlin's
help to make it happen

1078
00:38:13,192 --> 00:38:15,333
while concealing this from the public.

1079
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:18,150
That still may be an animating
principle for the president.

1080
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:21,171
He may believe that when he leaves office

1081
00:38:21,171 --> 00:38:22,992
that he still wants to build this tower.

1082
00:38:22,992 --> 00:38:24,492
And while that may not be criminal,

1083
00:38:24,492 --> 00:38:27,515
it is nonetheless corrupt
and distorts our policy.

1084
00:38:27,515 --> 00:38:31,504
So, you know, that is certainly
the central question for us.

1085
00:38:31,504 --> 00:38:32,680
In terms of who's telling the truth

1086
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,256
between Michael Cohen and the president,

1087
00:38:35,256 --> 00:38:37,903
we know that the president has made

1088
00:38:37,903 --> 00:38:39,779
probably over a thousand false statements

1089
00:38:39,779 --> 00:38:42,454
about the Russia issues.

1090
00:38:42,454 --> 00:38:44,688
And here we're going to
simply have to find what

1091
00:38:44,688 --> 00:38:47,294
corroboration we can to find
out where the truth lies.

1092
00:38:47,294 --> 00:38:48,777
- I was just going to
say is it safe to say

1093
00:38:48,777 --> 00:38:51,163
you can't take Michael Cohen
at his word on anything?

1094
00:38:51,163 --> 00:38:54,679
- I don't think in terms of
making the case to the public,

1095
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:57,060
and here we're not making
the case to a jury,

1096
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,553
about what took place
that we can rely solely

1097
00:38:59,553 --> 00:39:01,123
on the testimony of Michael Cohen.

1098
00:39:01,123 --> 00:39:03,307
We're going to need corroboration.

1099
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:05,211
You know, to me in looking
at what Michael Cohen

1100
00:39:05,211 --> 00:39:06,443
said in the open hearing,

1101
00:39:06,443 --> 00:39:08,474
and then what his lawyers said afterwards,

1102
00:39:08,474 --> 00:39:10,658
it was very much like
what Donald Trump did

1103
00:39:10,658 --> 00:39:13,208
when he said that he had no
knowledge of these payments

1104
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:15,639
to Stormy Daniels and
then Rudy Giuliani said,

1105
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:17,296
oh yes, he did.

1106
00:39:17,296 --> 00:39:19,073
Well, where is the truth there?

1107
00:39:19,073 --> 00:39:22,168
We asked Michael Cohen
about this extensively.

1108
00:39:22,168 --> 00:39:23,579
Those transcripts will be made public.

1109
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:26,759
The public can evaluate
his credibility themselves.

1110
00:39:26,759 --> 00:39:29,123
- You know, it looks like,
we don't know this for sure,

1111
00:39:29,123 --> 00:39:30,848
but it looks like Robert
Mueller's going to complete his

1112
00:39:30,848 --> 00:39:33,758
investigation without
subpoenaing the president

1113
00:39:33,758 --> 00:39:35,649
before the grand jury
or coming up with a way

1114
00:39:35,649 --> 00:39:37,986
to have him interviewed
before the grand jury.

1115
00:39:37,986 --> 00:39:42,403
President Clinton went before
Ken Starr's grand jury.

1116
00:39:43,744 --> 00:39:47,664
If indeed Mr. Mueller decides
not to issue that subpoena

1117
00:39:47,664 --> 00:39:48,952
or figure out how to get the president

1118
00:39:48,952 --> 00:39:50,558
in front of that grand jury,

1119
00:39:50,558 --> 00:39:51,513
is that going to have been a mistake

1120
00:39:51,513 --> 00:39:54,369
considering we have so many questions

1121
00:39:54,369 --> 00:39:57,533
about whose testimony should you believe,

1122
00:39:57,533 --> 00:40:00,333
Michael Cohen's or Donald Trump's?

1123
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:01,818
- Yes, I think it is a mistake.

1124
00:40:01,818 --> 00:40:04,583
And I've said all along that
I don't think Bob Mueller

1125
00:40:04,583 --> 00:40:06,823
should rely on written answers.

1126
00:40:06,823 --> 00:40:08,359
When you get written
answers from a witness,

1127
00:40:08,359 --> 00:40:09,846
it's really the lawyers' answers

1128
00:40:09,846 --> 00:40:12,298
as much as the client's answer.

1129
00:40:12,298 --> 00:40:13,424
And here you need to be able

1130
00:40:13,424 --> 00:40:16,026
to ask follow-up questions in real time.

1131
00:40:16,026 --> 00:40:17,523
But I think the constraint
that Bob Mueller's

1132
00:40:17,523 --> 00:40:20,813
operating under is he had
an acting attorney general

1133
00:40:20,813 --> 00:40:23,359
who was appointed because
he would be hostile

1134
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,533
to a subpoena on the president.

1135
00:40:25,533 --> 00:40:27,648
And now he has a
permanent attorney general

1136
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:30,616
who was chosen for the same
hostility to his investigation,

1137
00:40:30,616 --> 00:40:32,992
who would likely oppose that step.

1138
00:40:32,992 --> 00:40:34,312
I also think that the special counsel

1139
00:40:34,312 --> 00:40:38,145
feels some time pressure
to conclude his work.

1140
00:40:39,001 --> 00:40:40,919
And knowing that the
White House would drag out

1141
00:40:40,919 --> 00:40:43,608
a fight over the subpoena
that may be an issue as well.

1142
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:45,665
But I do think ultimately it's a mistake

1143
00:40:45,665 --> 00:40:48,102
because probably the
best way to get the truth

1144
00:40:48,102 --> 00:40:50,638
would be to put the president under oath.

1145
00:40:50,638 --> 00:40:52,790
Because as he's made plain in the past,

1146
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:56,249
he feels it's perfectly
fine to lie to the public.

1147
00:40:56,249 --> 00:40:57,257
After all, he has said,

1148
00:40:57,257 --> 00:40:59,262
"It's not like I'm talking
before a magistrate."

1149
00:40:59,262 --> 00:41:01,961
Well maybe he should
talk before a magistrate.

1150
00:41:01,961 --> 00:41:04,878
- I want to move to something
that was a bit confusing.

1151
00:41:04,878 --> 00:41:06,752
Erik Prince, who is the brother of

1152
00:41:06,752 --> 00:41:08,991
the secretary of education
but also has been

1153
00:41:08,991 --> 00:41:10,961
sort of before your committee having to do

1154
00:41:10,961 --> 00:41:15,232
with some odd meetings that he
had set up in the Seychelles,

1155
00:41:15,232 --> 00:41:20,232
he was on Al Jazeera and he
was asked about some testimony

1156
00:41:20,507 --> 00:41:23,938
to your committee and about
whether he lied or not.

1157
00:41:23,938 --> 00:41:25,727
Take a listen.

1158
00:41:25,727 --> 00:41:27,226
- We were there to talk about Iran policy.

1159
00:41:27,226 --> 00:41:28,113
- You were there to
talk about Iran policy?

1160
00:41:28,113 --> 00:41:28,964
- Uh-huh.

1161
00:41:28,964 --> 00:41:29,803
- Don't you think that's
something important

1162
00:41:29,803 --> 00:41:31,486
to disclose to the House
Intelligence Committee

1163
00:41:31,486 --> 00:41:32,319
while you're under oath?

1164
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:33,152
- I did.

1165
00:41:33,152 --> 00:41:34,328
- You didn't, we just went
through the testimony.

1166
00:41:34,328 --> 00:41:35,161
(audience laughing)

1167
00:41:35,161 --> 00:41:37,490
There's no mention of the Trump
Tower meeting August 2016.

1168
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:38,849
Why not?

1169
00:41:38,849 --> 00:41:41,016
- I don't know if they
got the transcript wrong.

1170
00:41:41,016 --> 00:41:43,553
- So this was about another meeting

1171
00:41:43,553 --> 00:41:46,169
that Erik Prince had I
believe with some other,

1172
00:41:46,169 --> 00:41:47,458
perhaps with some other representatives

1173
00:41:47,458 --> 00:41:49,744
of some other countries in Trump Tower,

1174
00:41:49,744 --> 00:41:51,704
the so-called second Trump Tower meeting

1175
00:41:51,704 --> 00:41:52,537
of less significance.

1176
00:41:52,537 --> 00:41:55,732
Not with Russians, with
other foreign countries.

1177
00:41:55,732 --> 00:41:57,218
Based on what you heard there,

1178
00:41:57,218 --> 00:41:58,730
is Mr. Prince telling the truth?

1179
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:00,746
Is your transcript wrong?

1180
00:42:00,746 --> 00:42:01,896
- Well, he's certainly
not telling the truth

1181
00:42:01,896 --> 00:42:02,775
in that interview.

1182
00:42:02,775 --> 00:42:04,400
There's nothing wrong with our transcript.

1183
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,664
There was nothing wrong with the reporter

1184
00:42:05,664 --> 00:42:08,530
who transcribed his testimony.

1185
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:11,598
He did not disclose that
meeting to our committee.

1186
00:42:11,598 --> 00:42:12,888
And in fact, as you can see

1187
00:42:12,888 --> 00:42:15,069
from the published
transcript of his interview,

1188
00:42:15,069 --> 00:42:17,715
he was asked what kind of
role he played, if any,

1189
00:42:17,715 --> 00:42:20,878
in the campaign, and
he said he had no role

1190
00:42:20,878 --> 00:42:24,511
apart from on his own
submitting written papers,

1191
00:42:24,511 --> 00:42:27,763
hanging a yard sign, or
making a contribution.

1192
00:42:27,763 --> 00:42:28,715
And he was also asked about

1193
00:42:28,715 --> 00:42:32,603
any substantive policy conversations
that he might have had.

1194
00:42:32,603 --> 00:42:35,491
So his, you know,
interview certainly looks

1195
00:42:35,491 --> 00:42:38,345
inconsistent with his testimony.

1196
00:42:38,345 --> 00:42:41,062
Bob Mueller has that testimony already.

1197
00:42:41,062 --> 00:42:43,063
And Bob Mueller will
have to make the decision

1198
00:42:43,063 --> 00:42:47,334
about whether that rises to a
level of deliberate falsehood.

1199
00:42:47,334 --> 00:42:49,309
But we had questions at
the time of his testimony

1200
00:42:49,309 --> 00:42:51,836
about his candor and his,

1201
00:42:51,836 --> 00:42:53,479
how forthcoming he was and those questions

1202
00:42:53,479 --> 00:42:54,640
have only been heightened now.

1203
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,821
- What's your concern
about what he was doing?

1204
00:42:57,821 --> 00:42:59,511
- Well, the concern is that, you know,

1205
00:42:59,511 --> 00:43:02,286
this is another concealed meeting.

1206
00:43:02,286 --> 00:43:04,791
This is another discussion that took place

1207
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:09,118
in the context of the meeting
that he had in the Seychelles.

1208
00:43:09,118 --> 00:43:10,391
There have been persistent questions

1209
00:43:10,391 --> 00:43:13,328
about whether the U.A.E. was
playing a back channel role

1210
00:43:13,328 --> 00:43:16,241
to the Russians during the campaign.

1211
00:43:16,241 --> 00:43:17,895
And those were a lot of the questions

1212
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:19,183
that we were asking him about.

1213
00:43:19,183 --> 00:43:22,838
So clearly this meeting at
Trump Tower with these players

1214
00:43:22,838 --> 00:43:25,888
was of direct interest to our committee.

1215
00:43:25,888 --> 00:43:27,538
So why conceal it?

1216
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:31,614
Why withhold that information
if there was nothing improper,

1217
00:43:31,614 --> 00:43:33,362
no improper purpose in it?

1218
00:43:33,362 --> 00:43:36,681
There are a lot of deeply concerning

1219
00:43:36,681 --> 00:43:38,923
and unanswered questions
around Erik Prince

1220
00:43:38,923 --> 00:43:41,792
and his involvement with the campaign.

1221
00:43:41,792 --> 00:43:43,683
- All right, Adam Schiff,
I will leave it there.

1222
00:43:43,683 --> 00:43:46,344
The Democratic lead on the
House Intelligence Committee,

1223
00:43:46,344 --> 00:43:47,177
the chairman.

1224
00:43:47,177 --> 00:43:48,782
Thanks very much for coming
on, getting up early,

1225
00:43:48,782 --> 00:43:50,109
and sharing your views
with us this morning.

1226
00:43:50,109 --> 00:43:50,942
- Thank you.

1227
00:43:50,942 --> 00:43:52,575
- When we come back,
the state the Democrats

1228
00:43:52,575 --> 00:43:54,917
have on their minds for 2020.

1229
00:43:54,917 --> 00:43:59,334
Could it be the game changer
that gets them over 270?

1230
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:02,029

- There are procedures and they will come.

1232
00:44:03,977 --> 00:44:07,013
- Oh is that what I tell the investors.

1233
00:44:07,013 --> 00:44:08,009
- Tell them we don't have to do this

1234
00:44:08,009 --> 00:44:09,842
one country at a time.

1235
00:44:10,985 --> 00:44:12,683
BDO says the approval process is similar

1236

1237
00:44:14,617 --> 00:44:16,073
- So parallel tracks?

1238
00:44:16,073 --> 00:44:20,034
- If we have first-hand
experience in each country.

1239
00:44:20,034 --> 00:44:22,427
- And BDO can find these people?

1240
00:44:22,427 --> 00:44:24,344
- BDO has these people.

1241
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,477

(adventurous rock music)

1270
00:45:31,494 --> 00:45:34,446
- [Announcer] We humans
are strange creatures.

1271
00:45:34,446 --> 00:45:38,060
Other species avoid pain and struggle.

1272
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:40,259
We actually seek it out.

1273
00:45:40,259 --> 00:45:44,617
Other species do difficult
things because they have to.

1274
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:46,588
We do difficult things

1275
00:45:46,588 --> 00:45:48,873
because we like to.

1276
00:45:48,873 --> 00:45:50,904
We think it's fun.

1277
00:45:50,904 --> 00:45:54,612
Introducing the all new 2019 Ford Ranger.

1278
00:45:54,612 --> 00:45:58,029
Built for the strangest of all creatures.

1279
00:46:00,093 --> 00:46:01,689
- Russia, if you're listening--

1280
00:46:01,689 --> 00:46:03,311
- [Announcer] The Mueller
report might not be ready,

1281
00:46:03,311 --> 00:46:04,912
but ours is.

1282
00:46:04,912 --> 00:46:05,965
From the infamous meeting.

1283
00:46:05,965 --> 00:46:07,578
- The question is what did Trump know,

1284
00:46:07,578 --> 00:46:08,978
and what did Trump direct?

1285
00:46:08,978 --> 00:46:10,053
- [Announcer] To the secret talks.

1286
00:46:10,053 --> 00:46:11,834
- I think Donald Trump is being handled

1287
00:46:11,834 --> 00:46:14,186
like he would be handled if Vladimir Putin

1288
00:46:14,186 --> 00:46:16,089
was still a KGB officer.

1289
00:46:16,089 --> 00:46:17,991
- [Announcer] What we know
about Trump and Putin.

1290
00:46:17,991 --> 00:46:18,824
- Again and again,

1291
00:46:18,824 --> 00:46:21,563
what happens in this
particular investigation,

1292
00:46:21,563 --> 00:46:23,004
are ties to Russia.

1293
00:46:23,004 --> 00:46:24,180
- [Announcer] Russia, if you're listening,

1294
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:25,397
Trump & Putin at nine,

1295
00:46:25,397 --> 00:46:28,061
followed by Headliners
Robert Mueller at 10,

1296
00:46:28,061 --> 00:46:29,502
tonight on MSNBC.

1297
00:46:29,502 --> 00:46:32,419
(orchestral music)

1298
00:46:33,855 --> 00:46:35,688
You're watching MSNBC.

1299
00:46:37,282 --> 00:46:39,399
- I wanna offer some
advice to you the viewer

1300
00:46:39,399 --> 00:46:41,778
as we enter the presidential campaign.

1301
00:46:41,778 --> 00:46:44,148
What should count most
for us doing the covering

1302
00:46:44,148 --> 00:46:45,827
and for you out there making the decisions

1303
00:46:45,827 --> 00:46:48,684
about who to support and
vote for ultimately is.

1304
00:46:48,684 --> 00:46:49,957
Who will they fight for?

1305
00:46:49,957 --> 00:46:51,372
What will they fight for?

1306
00:46:51,372 --> 00:46:54,281
Can they be trusted to do what they say?

1307
00:46:54,281 --> 00:46:56,786
Everything else is noise.

1308
00:46:56,786 --> 00:46:57,770
And trust me,

1309
00:46:57,770 --> 00:47:00,642
there will be an awful lot of
noise in the next 22 months.

1310
00:47:00,642 --> 00:47:02,712
We're committed to try
to turn down the din

1311
00:47:02,712 --> 00:47:05,629
and get answers about what matters.

1312
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:10,360
(upbeat electronic music)

1313
00:47:11,228 --> 00:47:12,388
- Welcome back, Data Download time.

1314
00:47:12,388 --> 00:47:13,886
Heading into the 2020 election,

1315
00:47:13,886 --> 00:47:15,208
Democrats are excited

1316
00:47:15,208 --> 00:47:17,922
about the opportunity
for an electoral pickup.

1317
00:47:17,922 --> 00:47:20,273
It's not Texas, it's not Arizona,

1318
00:47:20,273 --> 00:47:21,802
but Georgia.

1319
00:47:21,802 --> 00:47:23,129
That's right, a state that hasn't voted

1320
00:47:23,129 --> 00:47:26,839
for a Democrat for president
since Bill Clinton in 1992.

1321
00:47:26,839 --> 00:47:28,101
Let's look to Cobb County.

1322
00:47:28,101 --> 00:47:29,713
It's a suburb of Atlanta, part of which,

1323
00:47:29,713 --> 00:47:31,435
Newt Gingrich represented,

1324
00:47:31,435 --> 00:47:35,187
and the rapidly changing
politics of the last few years.

1325
00:47:35,187 --> 00:47:38,715
In 2012, Cobb County voted
for Republican Mitt Romney

1326
00:47:38,715 --> 00:47:41,264
for president by a whopping 12 points.

1327
00:47:41,264 --> 00:47:43,046
Just four years later, it
swung to Hillary Clinton,

1328
00:47:43,046 --> 00:47:45,540
and she won the county by just two points.

1329
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:48,659
And before you say, oh, that's
just a Donald Trump anomaly,

1330
00:47:48,659 --> 00:47:51,350
realize that this past
November, Stacey Abrams,

1331
00:47:51,350 --> 00:47:53,310
the Democratic candidate for governor,

1332
00:47:53,310 --> 00:47:56,405
won Cobb County by nearly 10 points,

1333
00:47:56,405 --> 00:47:59,444
so a 22-point swing in just six years.

1334
00:47:59,444 --> 00:48:00,743
What's going on?

1335
00:48:00,743 --> 00:48:03,934
We went down to Cobb
County to figure it out.

1336
00:48:03,934 --> 00:48:06,354
- Yeah it's changing out in Cobb County.

1337
00:48:06,354 --> 00:48:08,005
Lots of people were Republicans,

1338
00:48:08,005 --> 00:48:09,647
and now we've had a lot of move-ins,

1339
00:48:09,647 --> 00:48:11,650
and it's getting a mixture now.

1340
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:13,617
Like Georgia's becoming a mixture.

1341
00:48:13,617 --> 00:48:15,687
You know, I sort of liked it when,

1342
00:48:15,687 --> 00:48:18,602
you know, the Republican part of it.

1343
00:48:18,602 --> 00:48:20,981
- It's true, Cobb County
has seen a ton of people

1344
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:23,519
move in the last few years.

1345
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:25,266
Between 2010 and 2017,

1346
00:48:25,266 --> 00:48:28,178
Cobb County's population grew 9.8 percent,

1347
00:48:28,178 --> 00:48:31,105
outpacing growth in Georgia, as a whole.

1348
00:48:31,105 --> 00:48:34,480
In that same time, Cobb
County has grown more diverse,

1349
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,992
with increases to both
the African American

1350
00:48:35,992 --> 00:48:38,076
and Hispanic populations.

1351
00:48:38,076 --> 00:48:40,345
More residents also have college degrees.

1352
00:48:40,345 --> 00:48:41,842
And median household income has gone

1353
00:48:41,842 --> 00:48:44,425
from $66000 to $72000 per year.

1354
00:48:45,706 --> 00:48:47,609
The more telling data may be

1355
00:48:47,609 --> 00:48:51,135
where the transplants to
Cobb County are coming from.

1356
00:48:51,135 --> 00:48:55,506
Of the top 20 counties that
people move to Cobb from,

1357
00:48:55,506 --> 00:48:59,146
since 2012, 13 are from
outside the state of Georgia.

1358
00:48:59,146 --> 00:49:02,256
And 15 of those counties
voted for Hillary Clinton,

1359
00:49:02,256 --> 00:49:06,649
including Queens, New York,
LA County, and Miami-Dade.

1360
00:49:06,649 --> 00:49:08,696
This is just Cobb County, of course.

1361
00:49:08,696 --> 00:49:10,295
But you can see a lot of these changes

1362
00:49:10,295 --> 00:49:12,172
in the other suburban counties,

1363
00:49:12,172 --> 00:49:15,293
where the vote has also
swung towards the Democrats

1364
00:49:15,293 --> 00:49:16,247
in and around Atlanta.

1365
00:49:16,247 --> 00:49:20,080
So is Georgia ready to
be a swing state again?

1366
00:49:20,977 --> 00:49:23,807
- The younger crowd is definitely
going to go toward this.

1367
00:49:23,807 --> 00:49:25,174
- I have no doubt that
a progressive candidate

1368
00:49:25,174 --> 00:49:26,462
could win statewide.

1369
00:49:26,462 --> 00:49:28,502
- I think Georgia's been
a swing state before.

1370
00:49:28,502 --> 00:49:30,351
I think it's moving
towards that way again.

1371
00:49:30,351 --> 00:49:34,101
- I just can't imagine
not being a red state,

1372
00:49:35,687 --> 00:49:36,895
I really can't.

1373
00:49:36,895 --> 00:49:38,224
- We'll find out soon enough.

1374
00:49:38,224 --> 00:49:41,655
Coming up, Paul Manafort,
a controversial sentence,

1375
00:49:41,655 --> 00:49:45,713
and that claim that he's lived
an otherwise blameless life.

1376
00:49:45,713 --> 00:49:46,708
(tea kettle whistles)

1377
00:49:46,708 --> 00:49:48,494
- [Announcer] This is your wakeup call.

1378
00:49:48,494 --> 00:49:51,461
If you have moderate to
severe rheumatoid arthritis,

1379
00:49:51,461 --> 00:49:53,616
month after month the clock is ticking

1380
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:55,759
on irreversible joint damage.

1381
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:59,505
Ongoing pain and stiffness
are signs of joint erosion.

1382
00:49:59,505 --> 00:50:01,618
Humira can help stop the clock.

1383
00:50:01,618 --> 00:50:02,755
Prescribed for 15 years,

1384
00:50:02,755 --> 00:50:05,643
Humira targets and blocks
the source of inflammation

1385
00:50:05,643 --> 00:50:09,548
that contributes to joint
pain and irreversible damage.

to fight infections.

including tuberculosis and

and new or worsening heart failure.

Right here, right now, Humira.

1402

on the Dark Web.

1406
00:50:51,126 --> 00:50:52,272
- Good because I was a little worried

1407
00:50:52,272 --> 00:50:53,479
about my information getting out.

1408
00:50:53,479 --> 00:50:54,312
- [Customer Service Rep] Why's that?

Get it all, plus the entire
buffet, for one low price.

- Ahh it's just what I thought.

1419
00:51:17,539 --> 00:51:18,884
It's all going to have to come out.

1420

(woman breathes sharply)

1421
00:51:20,564 --> 00:51:21,397

(country music)

1423
00:51:24,973 --> 00:51:26,441
- If you don't have dental insurance,

1424

paying the bill can be really expensive.

00:51:31,831 --> 00:51:34,321
And other procedures like
crowns and root canals

1427
00:51:34,321 --> 00:51:37,243
can cost hundreds, even thousands more.

1428
00:51:37,243 --> 00:51:38,763
But now you can get dental insurance

1429

1444
00:52:16,208 --> 00:52:17,048
- Back now with End Game.

1445
00:52:17,048 --> 00:52:18,097
When the Des Moines Register found out

1446
00:52:18,097 --> 00:52:21,231
we were leading with
the Democratic divide,

1447
00:52:21,231 --> 00:52:22,465
they, of course, decided,
oh, we should hurry up

1448
00:52:22,465 --> 00:52:23,775
and get our poll in the field.

1449
00:52:23,775 --> 00:52:25,489
I don't think that was
the order of events.

1450
00:52:25,489 --> 00:52:27,407
But let me put up the
Des Moines Register poll

1451
00:52:27,407 --> 00:52:28,750
that's out this morning because it's going

1452
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:29,678
to have everybody talking.

1453
00:52:29,678 --> 00:52:31,582
And it's both meaningful and meaningless

1454
00:52:31,582 --> 00:52:32,617
all at the same time.

1455
00:52:32,617 --> 00:52:34,786
We see who the top two candidates
are, Biden and Sanders.

1456
00:52:34,786 --> 00:52:36,018
Only ones in double digits.

1457
00:52:36,018 --> 00:52:37,958
Warren at nine, Harris at seven,

1458
00:52:37,958 --> 00:52:39,093
and in case you're wondering,

1459
00:52:39,093 --> 00:52:41,176
right below Harris is Beto, at five,

1460
00:52:41,176 --> 00:52:44,534
Booker and Klobuchar the
only other two over 1%.

1461
00:52:44,534 --> 00:52:47,030
What is interesting there, Robert Costa,

1462
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:51,159
is the fact that you can
tell that buzz is everything.

1463
00:52:51,159 --> 00:52:52,798
Bernie's numbers went up six points

1464
00:52:52,798 --> 00:52:54,265
from the last time it went down.

1465
00:52:54,265 --> 00:52:56,617
And what's the difference
between last time and this time?

1466
00:52:56,617 --> 00:52:57,741
Bernie's in the middle
of an announcement tour.

1467
00:52:57,741 --> 00:53:00,052
So these things will continue to move

1468
00:53:00,052 --> 00:53:01,732
as announcement tours happen.

1469
00:53:01,732 --> 00:53:03,898
- And Senator Sanders, if you
watch him closely right now,

1470
00:53:03,898 --> 00:53:05,956
he's running as a movement politician.

1471
00:53:05,956 --> 00:53:08,491
He's gotten rid of his
traditional consultants,

1472
00:53:08,491 --> 00:53:09,708
like Tad Devine.

1473
00:53:09,708 --> 00:53:12,482
He has built a movement
from his 2016 campaign.

1474
00:53:12,482 --> 00:53:14,722
And you look at Senator
Warren, she has a message.

1475
00:53:14,722 --> 00:53:16,973
Break up the big companies, go after tech.

1476
00:53:16,973 --> 00:53:18,698
But it's a crowded space

1477
00:53:18,698 --> 00:53:21,218
on that left side of the Democratic Party.

1478
00:53:21,218 --> 00:53:22,716
- You know, Chuck, one of
the most interesting things,

1479
00:53:22,716 --> 00:53:24,452
I think, is in that poll is that,

1480
00:53:24,452 --> 00:53:26,004
if you look at the numbers for Biden,

1481
00:53:26,004 --> 00:53:27,112
the biggest chunk of them,

1482
00:53:27,112 --> 00:53:28,736
if you ask who their second choice is,

1483
00:53:28,736 --> 00:53:32,402
the answer's Bernie Sanders,
which is pretty remarkable.

1484
00:53:32,402 --> 00:53:33,611
And, you know, I do think--

1485
00:53:33,611 --> 00:53:34,772
- I thought so, too, it shows you

1486
00:53:34,772 --> 00:53:35,644
they're the mainstream of the party,

1487
00:53:35,644 --> 00:53:37,070
the two of them together.

1488
00:53:37,070 --> 00:53:38,235
- Potentially, yes.

1489
00:53:38,235 --> 00:53:41,651
And frankly, Bernie
Sanders' fundraising means

1490
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:43,284
that he is going to be a factor.

1491
00:53:43,284 --> 00:53:45,515
I mean, he has a core
of supporters, you know?

1492
00:53:45,515 --> 00:53:47,741
I'm not sure it's big enough
to win him any big states.

1493
00:53:47,741 --> 00:53:51,086
But if he pulls, you know,
20%, 25% consistently,

1494
00:53:51,086 --> 00:53:52,964
he's going to have the
money to go the distance.

1495
00:53:52,964 --> 00:53:55,274
Mark my words, you're going
to see him at the convention.

1496
00:53:55,274 --> 00:53:57,189
- And Bernie Sanders is
one of the few people

1497
00:53:57,189 --> 00:53:58,603
who never stopped campaigning.

1498
00:53:58,603 --> 00:54:01,531
He does Facebook Lives,
where he has 35000 people,

1499
00:54:01,531 --> 00:54:03,840
just on the spot, watching
him and following him.

1500
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,787
And what folks don't realize
is that he really appeals

1501
00:54:05,787 --> 00:54:07,284
to a lot of young voters.

1502
00:54:07,284 --> 00:54:10,475
For the very first time, young
voters are going to outweigh,

1503
00:54:10,475 --> 00:54:13,332
potentially, the Millennials,
excuse me, the Baby Boomers.

1504
00:54:13,332 --> 00:54:14,200
For the very first time,
they're going to actually have

1505
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,828
more eligible voters than we've ever seen.

1506
00:54:16,828 --> 00:54:18,209
- Well, therefore, I'd like to apologize

1507
00:54:18,209 --> 00:54:19,428
and do a resolution.

1508
00:54:19,428 --> 00:54:20,335
- Are you running?

1509
00:54:20,335 --> 00:54:22,532
- Based upon what I said
about the Millennials.

1510
00:54:22,532 --> 00:54:23,457
But I would like to say this.

1511
00:54:23,457 --> 00:54:25,223
The more these candidates get out,

1512
00:54:25,223 --> 00:54:27,478
we're going to see Trump numbers go up.

1513
00:54:27,478 --> 00:54:28,681
Because there is going to be a comparison

1514
00:54:28,681 --> 00:54:30,164
and it's already happening.

1515
00:54:30,164 --> 00:54:32,056
And I think, also, the
more Congressman Schiff

1516
00:54:32,056 --> 00:54:34,296
talks about investigations

1517
00:54:34,296 --> 00:54:36,114
and continuing these investigations

1518
00:54:36,114 --> 00:54:39,251
after the Mueller report, I
think Trump numbers will go up.

1519
00:54:39,251 --> 00:54:42,031
I think the Democrats are
going to put Trump in office.

1520
00:54:42,031 --> 00:54:43,774
- Speaking of the
president, I want to play

1521
00:54:43,774 --> 00:54:44,637
what he said about Paul Manafort.

1522
00:54:44,637 --> 00:54:46,411
Because there's a part of the empathy

1523
00:54:46,411 --> 00:54:48,861
that I really don't get,
when it comes to being

1524
00:54:48,861 --> 00:54:49,832
the sitting president
of the United States.

1525
00:54:49,832 --> 00:54:51,359
Take a listen.

1526
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:53,670
- I feel very badly for Paul Manafort.

1527
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:57,276
I think it's been a very,
very tough time for him.

1528
00:54:57,276 --> 00:55:00,934
But if you notice, both his lawyer,

1529
00:55:00,934 --> 00:55:04,655
a highly respected man, and a
very highly respected judge,

1530
00:55:04,655 --> 00:55:08,790
the judge said there was
no collusion with Russia.

1531
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:09,977
- Well, the judge did not say that,

1532
00:55:09,977 --> 00:55:11,855
though the judge did
say this about Manafort,

1533
00:55:11,855 --> 00:55:13,520
"I think the sentencing
range is excessive.

1534
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,103
"Manafort has been a
good friend to others,

1535
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:15,936
"a generous person.

1536
00:55:15,936 --> 00:55:17,665
"He has lived an
otherwise blameless life."

1537
00:55:17,665 --> 00:55:19,110
What I don't understand Robert Costa,

1538
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:22,302
is why the president is
praising and feeling sorry

1539
00:55:22,302 --> 00:55:24,150
for a man that defrauded
American taxpayers

1540
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:25,494
for at least $6 million.

1541
00:55:25,494 --> 00:55:26,670
- And you know who else wonders that?

1542
00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:27,790
Many Trump advisors.

1543
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:30,053
Talking to them, in recent
days, they wish the president

1544
00:55:30,053 --> 00:55:32,800
would actually be quiet
about Paul Manafort.

1545
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,902
They wish Judge Ellis, of Alexandria,

1546
00:55:34,902 --> 00:55:36,186
would be their spokesman.

1547
00:55:36,186 --> 00:55:37,019
- [Chuck] Could've been.

1548
00:55:37,019 --> 00:55:38,444
- Because they say he's the
person who's actually making

1549
00:55:38,444 --> 00:55:40,057
the best case for this administration.

1550
00:55:40,057 --> 00:55:41,905
Bill Shine, the deputy chief of staff,

1551
00:55:41,905 --> 00:55:43,611
out as the communications head,

1552
00:55:43,611 --> 00:55:45,043
the president going on and on,

1553
00:55:45,043 --> 00:55:46,818
talking about possible pardons.

1554
00:55:46,818 --> 00:55:48,806
They wish all that would just be noise.

1555
00:55:48,806 --> 00:55:52,025
It's the Ellis case,
diminishing the Mueller probe,

1556
00:55:52,025 --> 00:55:53,397
that's what the White House really wants.

1557
00:55:53,397 --> 00:55:54,854
But they can't stay on message.

1558
00:55:54,854 --> 00:55:55,687
- [Chuck] Because of Manafort.

1559
00:55:55,687 --> 00:55:57,332
- There's a video right
now, a famous video,

1560
00:55:57,332 --> 00:56:00,329
of a whale almost swallowing

1561
00:56:00,329 --> 00:56:03,747
a person swimming in the
ocean and he spits him out.

1562
00:56:03,747 --> 00:56:05,833
Trump needs to spit Manafort out.

1563
00:56:05,833 --> 00:56:08,129
And the chairman of the
Intelligence Committee

1564
00:56:08,129 --> 00:56:09,627
needs to get rid of Cohen.

1565
00:56:09,627 --> 00:56:11,923
Stay away from both of them.

1566
00:56:11,923 --> 00:56:13,521
They're not good for either party.

1567
00:56:13,521 --> 00:56:14,473
- I think, first, we need to clarify

1568
00:56:14,473 --> 00:56:16,349
that this what he was
getting sentenced for

1569
00:56:16,349 --> 00:56:17,399
was not for Russian collusion.

1570
00:56:17,399 --> 00:56:19,246
So that we have to set the table for--

1571
00:56:19,246 --> 00:56:20,716
- No, but he was ripping
off the American government

1572
00:56:20,716 --> 00:56:22,966
over 30 years of lobbying.
- Exactly right.

1573
00:56:22,966 --> 00:56:24,560
Exactly right and so
one of the conversations

1574
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:27,540
that people are having is that
how unjust the sentence was

1575
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:28,459
for this type of crime.

1576
00:56:28,459 --> 00:56:29,914
And we can look at other judges.

1577
00:56:29,914 --> 00:56:31,987
But if we look,
particularly, at this judge,

1578
00:56:31,987 --> 00:56:34,813
this judge threw the book
at Representative Jefferson,

1579
00:56:34,813 --> 00:56:36,099
from Louisiana.
- William Jefferson.

1580
00:56:36,099 --> 00:56:38,186
An African American
Democrat from New Orleans.

1581
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:39,200
- Right, who basically said,

1582
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:42,280
who basically was found to have
embezzled close to $400000.

1583
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:45,543
- The freezer cash, the
infamous freezer cash.

1584
00:56:45,543 --> 00:56:47,206
- Those numbers are so much lower

1585
00:56:47,206 --> 00:56:48,737
than what Paul Manafort was dealing with.

1586
00:56:48,737 --> 00:56:50,166
- Well, and this is where you talk about,

1587
00:56:50,166 --> 00:56:52,854
is there justice, when it
comes to white-collar crime?

1588
00:56:52,854 --> 00:56:54,157
Manafort is incredibly connected.

1589
00:56:54,157 --> 00:56:57,461
He was basically verging,
teetering, on treason,

1590
00:56:57,461 --> 00:56:58,652
when it comes to this.

1591
00:56:58,652 --> 00:57:01,045
Was that fair, and that is
where we actually have to unpack

1592
00:57:01,045 --> 00:57:02,654
the sentence that he's serving.

1593
00:57:02,654 --> 00:57:03,932
- There's more sentencing,
there is more sentencing

1594
00:57:03,932 --> 00:57:06,187
coming for Mr. Manafort.

1595
00:57:06,187 --> 00:57:08,041
The Spinal Tap drummer
position of the White House,

1596
00:57:08,041 --> 00:57:08,874
I mean,
(group laughs)

1597
00:57:08,874 --> 00:57:10,651
the communications director
position at the White House.

1598
00:57:10,651 --> 00:57:14,687
- [Pat] Wow, that's an
inside joke, I love it.

1599
00:57:14,687 --> 00:57:16,253
- I mean, you brought up Bill Shine.

1600
00:57:16,253 --> 00:57:17,086
Who will take it?

1601
00:57:17,086 --> 00:57:18,338
- Would you want to be the
White House communications

1602
00:57:18,338 --> 00:57:19,171
director, Chuck?
- The president is now

1603
00:57:19,171 --> 00:57:20,112
the communications director again.

1604
00:57:20,112 --> 00:57:21,579
What does this mean, Kasie?

1605
00:57:21,579 --> 00:57:25,376
- Well, I think it means, you
know, to Bob's earlier point,

1606
00:57:25,376 --> 00:57:26,871
that we're going to see more of the same.

1607
00:57:26,871 --> 00:57:29,393
I mean, you know, I
certainly wouldn't want to be

1608
00:57:29,393 --> 00:57:30,681
the person that needs to tell

1609
00:57:30,681 --> 00:57:31,689
the president of the United States

1610
00:57:31,689 --> 00:57:33,091
how to communicate with
the American people.

1611
00:57:33,091 --> 00:57:34,028
I mean, good luck.

1612
00:57:34,028 --> 00:57:37,080
He's been doing it himself,
literally, his entire life.

1613
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:38,538
- How much did the New Yorker piece

1614
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:40,722
have to do with Shine's quick release?

1615
00:57:40,722 --> 00:57:43,115
- The president was
frustrated with Bill Shine

1616
00:57:43,115 --> 00:57:45,131
not bringing all of the Fox News expertise

1617
00:57:45,131 --> 00:57:46,811
and helping to elevate
his image with the press.

1618
00:57:46,811 --> 00:57:49,574
The most revealing speech
of the most recent weeks,

1619
00:57:49,574 --> 00:57:50,554
President Trump at CPAC.

1620
00:57:50,554 --> 00:57:51,387
- [Chuck] Oh, yeah.

1621
00:57:51,387 --> 00:57:52,220
- Two hours.

1622
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:53,053
- [Chuck] Yeah, unpack that.

1623
00:57:53,053 --> 00:57:55,505
- [Pat] The volume was at
11 for President Trump,

1624
00:57:55,505 --> 00:57:57,043
during that speech.

1625
00:57:57,043 --> 00:57:58,783
- Ah that's all I have for today.

1626
00:57:58,783 --> 00:57:59,746
Thank you for watching.

1627
00:57:59,746 --> 00:58:01,482
Thank you for springing forward with us.

1628
00:58:01,482 --> 00:58:02,964
We'll be back next week.

1629
00:58:02,964 --> 00:58:04,659
Because if it's Sunday,
no matter the hour,

1630
00:58:04,659 --> 00:58:06,326
it's Meet the Press.

1631
00:58:30,191 --> 00:58:32,069
- [Announcer] More
Americans watch NBC News

1632
00:58:32,069 --> 00:58:35,741
than any other news
organization in the world.

1633
00:58:35,741 --> 00:58:38,093
- I've always been amazed by what's next,

1634
00:58:38,093 --> 00:58:39,717
and still going for my best,

1635
00:58:39,717 --> 00:58:41,550
even though I live with
a higher risk of stroke

1636
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:44,470
due to AFIB not caused
by a heart valve problem.

1637
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:46,432
So if there's a better
treatment than Warfarin,

1638
00:58:46,432 --> 00:58:47,867
I want that too.

1639
00:58:47,867 --> 00:58:49,141
Eliquis.

1640
00:58:49,141 --> 00:58:51,312
Eliquis is proven to reduce stroke risk

1641
00:58:51,312 --> 00:58:53,060
better than Warfarin, plus,

1642
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:55,793
at significantly less major
bleeding than Warfarin.

1643
00:58:55,793 --> 00:58:59,011
Eliquis is FDA-approved and has both.

1644
00:58:59,011 --> 00:59:01,282
What's next, reeling in a nice one.

1645
00:59:01,282 --> 00:59:02,186
- [Announcer] Don't stop taking Eliquis

1646
00:59:02,186 --> 00:59:03,866
unless your doctor tells you to,

1647
00:59:03,866 --> 00:59:06,342
as stopping increases your
risk of having a stroke.

1648
00:59:06,342 --> 00:59:09,162
Eliquis can cause serious and
in rare cases fatal bleeding.

1649
00:59:09,162 --> 00:59:11,851
Don't take Eliquis if you have
an artificial heart valve,

1650
00:59:11,851 --> 00:59:13,225
or abnormal bleeding.

1651
00:59:13,225 --> 00:59:15,769
While taking Eliquis you
may bruise more easily.

1652
00:59:15,769 --> 00:59:16,880
And it may take longer than usual

1653
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,377
for any bleeding to stop.

1654
00:59:18,377 --> 00:59:21,050
Seek immediate medical care
for sudden signs of bleeding,

1655
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:22,297
like unusual bruising.

1656
00:59:22,297 --> 00:59:23,851
Eliquis may increase your bleeding risk

1657
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:25,416
if you take certain medicines.

1658
00:59:25,416 --> 00:59:26,707
Tell your doctor about all planned

1659
00:59:26,707 --> 00:59:28,570
medical or dental procedures.

1660
00:59:28,570 --> 00:59:29,905
- [Man] Eliquis, the number one

1661
00:59:29,905 --> 00:59:32,050
cardiologist prescribed blood thinner.

1662
00:59:32,050 --> 00:59:35,713
Ask your doctor if Eliquis
is what's next for you.

1663
00:59:35,713 --> 00:59:37,789
(water splashes)

1664
00:59:37,789 --> 00:59:38,797
- [Announcer] Guys do whatever it takes

1665
00:59:38,797 --> 00:59:40,954
to deal with shave irritation.

1666
00:59:40,954 --> 00:59:42,605
So we re-imagined the razor

1667
00:59:42,605 --> 00:59:45,517
with the new Gillette skin guard.

1668
00:59:45,517 --> 00:59:48,471
It has a unique guard between the blades

1669
00:59:48,471 --> 00:59:53,078
that's designed to reduce
irritation during a shave.

1670
00:59:53,078 --> 00:59:57,828
Because we believe all men
deserve a razor just for them.

1671
00:59:59,101 --> 01:00:01,018
The best a man can get.

1672
01:00:02,278 --> 01:00:03,111
Gillette.

1673
01:00:05,022 --> 01:00:06,713
- I don't keep track of regrets

1674
01:00:06,713 --> 01:00:08,115
and I don't add up the years,

1675
01:00:08,115 --> 01:00:10,329
but what I do count on is Boost.

1676
01:00:10,329 --> 01:00:12,782
- [Announcer] Delicious Boost
High Protein nutritional drink

1677
01:00:12,782 --> 01:00:14,637
has 20 grams of protein along with

1678
01:00:14,637 --> 01:00:17,232
26 essential vitamins and minerals.

1679
01:00:17,232 --> 01:00:18,519
Boost High Protein.
