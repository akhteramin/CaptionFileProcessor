Thanks for coming!

21
00:00:54,811 --> 00:00:56,045
Thank you!

22
00:00:56,045 --> 00:00:57,460
Welcome!

23
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,210
Welcome to Hollywood!

24
00:01:00,285 --> 00:01:02,529
I appreciate that!

25
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:04,320
Hey I have a story,

26
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,380
so last night after the show

27
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,729
I hosted a concert, there was
a big concert at the Forum.

28
00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:11,727
(audience cheering and applauding)

29
00:01:11,727 --> 00:01:13,860
It was a tribute to the
late, great Chris Cornell,

30
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,696
were you there, is that
why you're yelling, okay!

31
00:01:15,696 --> 00:01:16,529
(audience cheering)

32
00:01:16,529 --> 00:01:20,380
The lineup was incredible,
it was Chris Stapleton,

33
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:24,130
Adam Levine, Metallica,
Miley Cyrus, Foo Fighters,

34
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:26,600
Audioslave, Soundgarden, amazing!

35
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,930
And you had fun, right Guillermo?

36
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,970
- A lot of fun!
- Guillermo had a lot of fun.

37
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,040
(Guillermo laughing heartily)
- Guillermo was like,

38
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,291
hey, are you going to that, it's like,

39
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:34,230
yeah, yeah come with me to the show

40
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,090
and Cleto went, and Dicky went,

41
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,940
Jeff our keyboard player went, a few guys.

42
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,130
At one point in the night,
I think it was two-thirds

43
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,670
of the way through the
show, I was on stage

44
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,750
and somebody yelled, where's Guillermo?

45
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,710
So I gave Guillermo a shout-out,
I said Guillermo is here,

46
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,860
and the whole Forum erupted in tears.

47
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,370
It was crazy, it was like, it
was about the same reaction

48
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:55,705
they gave Brad Pitt and so
then, (audience laughing)

49
00:01:55,705 --> 00:01:58,640
I go backstage, I text
Guillermo 'cause I wanna,

50
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,090
kind of know what he thought,

51
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,120
and where were you when you
got the text I sent you?

52
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,797
- I was at home!
- He was at home, yeah.

53
00:02:04,797 --> 00:02:05,890
(audience laughing heartily)

54
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,580
After Metallica he ditched us

55
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,290
and got in an Uber and went home. (laughs)

56
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:12,510
In fairness Guillermo has to go bed early

57
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,738
because he's gotta be at work at 2:00 p.m.

58
00:02:15,738 --> 00:02:17,680
(audience laughing)

59
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,310
Today is day 27 of the government
shutdown which is nuts.

60
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,670
Remember when Trump said he'd run

61
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:23,910
the government like a business?

62
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,273
Turns out the business was Radio Shack!

63
00:02:26,273 --> 00:02:27,640
(audience laughing and applauding)

64
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,843
Trump is--
(audience cheering)

65
00:02:29,843 --> 00:02:31,824
Desperately--
(audience applauding)

66
00:02:31,824 --> 00:02:35,120
Trying to pin blame for
this shutdown on Democrats,

67
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,420
he lashed out this morning.

68
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,997
He wrote, "The left has
become totally unhinged.

69
00:02:38,997 --> 00:02:42,140
"They no care what right for our country!"

70
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,380
That's right, and you see how he spelled,

71
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,950
he's just as good at spelling country

72
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,570
as he is in running it, it's--
(audience laughing)

73
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:50,000
Most of Trump's hire is directed

74
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,690
at Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House.

75
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:55,690
Yesterday Nancy Pelosi
sent the president a letter

76
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:58,010
suggesting he postpone his scheduled

77
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,610
State of the Union Address,
until the shutdown is over.

78
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,350
She will not permit him to give it

79
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,780
from the House of Representatives.

80
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,940
So today, Trump retaliated
with a letter of his own

81
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,840
informing Nancy Pelosi
that he was canceling

82
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,830
her flight to Afghanistan.

83
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,090
She's going there on a military aircraft,

84
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,093
and he told her, if she wants
to go she can fly commercial!

85
00:03:17,093 --> 00:03:18,780
(audience laughing)

86
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,551
Into a war zone!

87
00:03:20,551 --> 00:03:23,460
And, he sent the letter less an hour

88
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,070
before she was supposed to leave.

89
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,860
It was the presidential equivalent of,

90
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,293
you break up with me, I break up with you!

91
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,843
And I bet he was so delighted with himself

92
00:03:31,843 --> 00:03:33,320
when he came up with this idea.

93
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,060
In fact an official from
the White House said,

94
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,170
he spent the day watching coverage of it

95
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,230
and was very pleased this afternoon.

96
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,780
But he may the only one who's pleased,

97
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,270
because even some of his
fellow Republicans said

98
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:47,830
this was a petty thing to do,
and all the Democrats are mad.

99
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,540
This is from CNN today,
reporter Phil Mattingly

100
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:54,534
stopped the House Majority
Leader Steny Hoyer, like this:

101
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:55,367
- We're really seeing--
- Hold on one second,

102
00:03:55,367 --> 00:03:57,025
I'm sorry to interrupt, here's
the House Majority Leader

103
00:03:57,025 --> 00:03:59,030
Steny Hoyer, talking
about what's going on--

104
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,140
- Okay, hold on a second,

105
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,620
because that is the most
threatening microphone

106
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,348
I think I've ever seen in my life!

107
00:04:04,348 --> 00:04:08,330
(audience laughing and applauding)

108
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,083
Gimme your money old man!

109
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,870
Desperate times I guess!

110
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,310
You know, if the Democrats
can't convince Trump

111
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,730
to end this silly shutdown I
think I know somebody who can.

112
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,610
Lot of people would try
to make sense out of this

113
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:22,780
but the clearest voice I've
heard on the subject so far,

114
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,590
believe it or not, came from Cardi B.

115
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,410
- Hey y'all, I just wanna remind ya

116
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,100
because it's been a little
bit over three weeks okay?

117
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,880
It's been a little bit over three weeks.

118
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,730
Trump, is now ordering as his summonse,

119
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:39,110
federal government workers
to go back to work,

120
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,410
without getting paid.

121
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,674
Now, I don't wanna hear
ya (bleep) talkin' about,

122
00:04:42,674 --> 00:04:45,200
oh, but Obama shut down
the government for 17 days,

123
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,370
yeah bitch!

124
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,530
For healthcare!

125
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,270
So your grandma could
check her blood pressure,

126
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,390
and you bitches could
go check your (bleep)

127
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,908
at the gynecologist with
no mother (bleep) problem!

128
00:04:53,908 --> 00:04:58,158
(audience laughing and applauding)

129
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,458
- Cardi B is right!

130
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,403
(audience applauding)

131
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:06,700
Almost 800,000 federal
employees are not getting paid,

132
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,877
and every night until it's over

133
00:05:07,877 --> 00:05:11,090
we're hiring a furloughed
worker per night.

134
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,920
Last night we brought in a NASA
engineer who was out of work

135
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,390
and now let's say hello to
our new employee tonight,

136
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,510
please welcome Andrew Rigopoulos!

137
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,141
Andrew, come on in here!

138
00:05:20,141 --> 00:05:23,308
(audience cheering and applauding)

139
00:05:23,308 --> 00:05:24,141
Welcome!

140
00:05:24,141 --> 00:05:25,510
Thank you for coming!
- I'm here!

141
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,240
- So I see this!

142
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,150
Tell us what you do, specifically.

143
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,390
- I'm an engine station ranger

144
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,630
at Cabrillo National Monument

145
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,570
in San Diego--
- You are a ranger!

146
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:35,900
And so you work in, we still
have national parks correct?

147
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,230
- We do--
- That's a good sign, yeah?

148
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,890
- Well, if people over
visit 'em and damage 'em

149
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,020
then we won't have them anymore.

150
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,910
- And right now, there's nobody working

151
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,410
at the park you work at--
- No, we have a crew

152
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:46,790
of rangers that actually watch it

153
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:49,100
to make sure that our
resources aren't damaged

154
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,030
while we're there--
- You are considered

155
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,640
to be a non-essential government employee?

156
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,300
- Yeah, I stay home and
watch a lot of Netflix--

157
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,550
- Yeah, okay. (audience laughing)

158
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,500
Well you actually came up,
usually we come up with the job,

159
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,140
but you came up with an
idea for a job, that I like.

160
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,293
- Yeah, I pitched it to my
brother first and he said--

161
00:06:03,293 --> 00:06:05,550
- What're you gonna do for us tonight?

162
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,960
- Since parks are important
and nature's important--

163
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,910
- Yes?
- I'm gonna take care

164
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,960
of our urban landscape
and water your plants.

165
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,320
- You're gonna water the plants here--

166
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,153
- Yeah--
- Now we don't have

167
00:06:13,153 --> 00:06:14,740
that many plants.
- No.

168
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,290
- But if you see any, water 'em.

169
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,870
- Okay.
- Okay, thank you very much.

170
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,297
- Thank you.
- I appreciate it.

171
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,738
(audience cheering and applauding)

172
00:06:22,738 --> 00:06:24,738
- So Andrew, oh, Andrew!

173
00:06:25,662 --> 00:06:26,680
I forgot, we got you this!

174
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,850
So in case you don't you
have one of your own.

175
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:29,683
- Thank you--
- And by the way,

176
00:06:29,683 --> 00:06:32,260
if you see any funny lookin' plants,

177
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,150
just ignore them okay?
- Okay.

178
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,917
- Thank you very much,
that's Andrew, Rigopoulos!

179
00:06:38,143 --> 00:06:42,730
(audience cheering and applauding)

180
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:45,240
The president appears to
be on a collision course

181
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,810
with the law right now, his
alleged lawyer Rudy Giuliani

182
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,640
was back on CNN last night,
and rudier than ever.

183
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:55,200
He made a crazy appearance,
on Chris Cuomo's show.

184
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,000
This one, if we didn't have this on video

185
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,350
it would almost be too much to believe.

186
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,780
- The amount of false
reporting about this case,

187
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,136
is despicable!
- Mr. Mayor, false reporting--

188
00:07:04,136 --> 00:07:05,660
- It's despicable--
- Is saying that nobody

189
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,770
in the campaign had any
contacts with Russia.

190
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,640
False reporting, is saying that there

191
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,970
has been no suggestion
of any kind of collusion

192
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,190
between the campaign and any Russians.

193
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,820
Because now you have Paul Manafort,

194
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,548
giving poll data--
- I never said--

195
00:07:17,548 --> 00:07:19,040
- That winds up leading
to this coincidence--

196
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,810
- Well you just misstated my position.

197
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,760
I never said there was no
collusion between the campaign,

198
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,570
or between people in the campaign--

199
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,100
- Yes you have--
- I have no idea, I have not!

200
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,540
I said the president of the United States.

201
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,010
There is not a single bit of evidence

202
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,620
the president of the United States,

203
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,680
committed the only crime
you could commit here,

204
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,578
conspired with the
Russians to hack to DNC.

205
00:07:36,578 --> 00:07:39,010
- (laughs) Wow, really!

206
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,010
Of course he never said it.

207
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,980
Nobody in the Trump
administration ever said

208
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,539
any of the things they
say all the time but--

209
00:07:44,539 --> 00:07:45,830
(audience laughing) But there must be

210
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,680
another Rudy Giuliani out there

211
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,950
who's been going around
saying there was no collusion,

212
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,250
between Russia and the campaign.

213
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,360
- Is it still the position
of you and your client,

214
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,480
that there was no collusion
with the Russians whatsoever

215
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,880
on behalf of the Trump campaign?

216
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,050
- Correct.
- Correct.

217
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,290
So he did say it.

218
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,130
The surest sign of how deeply screwed up

219
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:08,480
this administration is,
is that Rudy Giuliani

220
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,186
is still allowed to go on
TV, to speak on their behalf.

221
00:08:12,186 --> 00:08:13,900
(audience laughing) Go on, Rudy!

222
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,082
- The president did not--
- We said nobody had--

223
00:08:16,082 --> 00:08:16,970
- With the Russians--
- Any contact, tons--

224
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,020
- Whatever collusion is--
- Of people are contacted.

225
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,770
Nobody colluded, the guy
running his campaign--

226
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,648
- He didn't say nobody--
- Was working on an issue--

227
00:08:22,648 --> 00:08:23,481
- He said he didn't--

228
00:08:23,481 --> 00:08:24,450
- At the same time as the convention.

229
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:27,120
- He said he didn't,
he didn't say, nobody.

230
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,380
How would you know, that
nobody in your campaign--

231
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,210
- He actually did say that, Rudy.

232
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,043
He said nobody--
- Well I never that--

233
00:08:32,043 --> 00:08:33,480
- And then he said as far as I know--

234
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,680
- If he said that he said it in,

235
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,410
well as far as he knows that's true!

236
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,920
- Rudy Giuliani is like a
Choose Your Own Adventure!

237
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,640
It just changes! (audience laughing)

238
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,180
But the truth is it doesn't
matter what Rudy Giuliani says,

239
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,670
he's not the one being investigated yet!

240
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,010
But what matters is,

241
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:50,650
did the president say
there was no collusion

242
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,230
between the Russians and his campaign?

243
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,810
- There was no collusion between

244
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:59,350
the Trump campaign and the Russian people.

245
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:02,420
- Yeah, and at some point,
Rudy's gonna have to deny

246
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,000
that Trump is even the president.

247
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,050
But the important thing,
in Giuliani's mind

248
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:10,450
is that Robert Mueller
put this thing to rest.

249
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,400
- He puts out the report,
and then we get it

250
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,330
and we see what it has--
- Well let's--

251
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:14,350
- I've always seen this--
- Let's get it now--

252
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,110
- I've always seen this
as a false argument,

253
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,300
the idea of he's now
showing us what he has--

254
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,600
- Well let's do it--
- It's not over.

255
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,860
- Well let's do it.

256
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,370
- But he's gotta finish--
- It's over enough!

257
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:23,722
We've answered all those--
- What does that mean--

258
00:09:23,722 --> 00:09:25,620
- Questions on collusion--
- Over enough?

259
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,130
- How much longer are you
gonna let him do this--

260
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,550
- He just put out that
your campaign chairman

261
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,790
was playing with the Russians!

262
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:34,310
- But we don't, that isn't what,

263
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,710
we don't need a special council

264
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,590
to investigate a campaign chairman.

265
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,910
- Oh boy, poor Rudy!

266
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,810
Someday he's gonna be in a mental facility

267
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:44,510
telling the nurses that he used
to be the mayor or New York

268
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:48,289
and they'll be like,
uh-huh! (audience laughing)

269
00:09:48,289 --> 00:09:50,430
In the mean time, (audience applauding)

270
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:53,900
while that's goin' on
there, we have new details

271
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,070
about Trump's former
lawyer/friend Micheal Cohen.

272
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,500
According to the Wall Street Journal,

273
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,130
and according to Cohen
himself in a lead up

274
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:04,120
to Trump's run for president,
Cohen hired a company

275
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,280
to rig online polls in his favor.

276
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,700
You know these polls that you go on

277
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,110
and click which thing you want?

278
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,380
But Cohen says, the president directed him

279
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,320
to juice two polls, a CNBC poll

280
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,510
of America's top business
leaders, and a Drudge Report poll

281
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,260
of Republican candidates for president.

282
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,470
Even those didn't work out.

283
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,830
Not only did he not win
either of the polls,

284
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,740
I think he didn't even crack
the top 100 in the CNBC one.

285
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,680
The guy Cohen hired to do
this, according to The Journal

286
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,840
showed up at Trump Tower,
looking for $50,000 he was owed

287
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,430
and when he did, the
report says Cohen gave him

288
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:39,660
a Walmart bag with 12 to $13,000 in cash

289
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,980
and a boxing glove he
claimed had been worn

290
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,890
by a Brazilian MMA fighter as payment.

291
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:48,058
It's like a scene out of the
world's dumbest heist movie,

292
00:10:48,058 --> 00:10:50,450
(audience laughing)
it's Ocean's Chapter 11.

293
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:53,700
And so, the goon Cohen hired is an IT guy,

294
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,890
he's got a company, his
name is John Gauger.

295
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,950
There's not much about him online,

296
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:01,710
but this audition tape he
made trying to get on Survivor

297
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:04,893
in 2005 kind of tells
you all you need to know.

298
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,820
- In my line of business
I deal with people

299
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,810
from around the globe on a daily basis.

300
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:14,800
This has given the uncanny
ability to make anybody like me.

301
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,190
This will allow me to be

302
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:20,070
the most loved Survivor
contestant of all times,

303
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,520
and maybe the most hated too.

304
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,980
- Only the best people, you know?

305
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,770
Literally everyone around Trump

306
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,780
is a character from a reality show,

307
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:34,230
and that is not even the
best part of the story.

308
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:37,250
So Cohen also asked the
guy, while he was doin' this

309
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:40,580
to set up a Twitter account
called Women for Cohen.

310
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,910
This is a real account,
was created back in 2016,

311
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:47,207
it's for quote, "Women who
love and support Michael Cohen.

312
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:51,047
"Strong, pit bull, sex
symbol, no nonsense."

313
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,110
Basically Cohen asked this
guy, help me rig the election.

314
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,200
Hey, while you're at it,

315
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,411
could you make people
think girls like me too?

316
00:11:58,411 --> 00:12:00,070
(audience laughing) Because I loved this

317
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,380
I clicked to see who was
following this account,

318
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:06,420
and some of the women for
Cohen are named John, Ted,

319
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,480
Elvis, Theodore, Kevin and Sonny.

320
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,870
We also have Steve, Douglas, Aaron,

321
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,490
Casillas, Chris and Bill.

322
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,630
And these are some of
the things they tweeted.

323
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,640
Put that up on the screen.

324
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,710
Snazzy looking & ready to
#MAGA. (audience laughing)

325
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,780

326
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,360
heart and emoji, we love you guys!

327
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,730
This has gotta be the saddest thing

328
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:28,470
I ever heard of in my whole life.

329
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,870
We're like a wee away from finding out

330
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,300
Michael Cohen had a burner phone

331
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,500
he used to send dirty texts to
himself! (audience laughing)

332
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,580
I may have underestimated Michael,

333
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,810
'cause he might be a lot more hilarious

334
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:40,210
than I ever imagined!

335
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,690
Hey by the way, I don't
know if you heard about this

336
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:44,560
but YouTube is, you familiar with YouTube?

337
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,110
Yeah, okay, YouTube is
cracking down on fun.

338
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:50,460
YouTube announced that they're
banning dangerous pranks

339
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,550
and challenges from their platform.

340
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,637
They posted this.

341
00:12:53,637 --> 00:12:56,087
"Dangerous Challenges and
Pranks Enforcement Update.

342
00:12:56,087 --> 00:12:57,897
"Hi everybody, YouTube is home

343
00:12:57,897 --> 00:12:59,787

challenges and pranks,

344
00:12:59,787 --> 00:13:02,470

345
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:05,517

00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,720
blah, blah, blah, "dangerous activities"

351
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,553
all this kind of stuff.

352
00:13:16,553 --> 00:13:19,300
Basically YouTube has just
banned YouTube videos.

353
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,400
And (audience laughing) I have to say

354
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,460
someone that loves a good
prank and likes to do them,

355
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,850
I think it's sad that a few bad apples

356
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:28,730
had to ruin the fun of eating
poisonous detergent packets

357
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:31,590
for everyone but, (audience
laughing) the bigger question is

358
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,630
how do you know before you do something

359
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,703
what qualifies as
dangerous and what doesn't?

360
00:13:35,703 --> 00:13:37,460
I mean we've done some stuff that

361
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,690
could potentially go in
a dangerous direction.

362
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,820
So anyway, YouTube
happens to have an office

363
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,740
right next door to us
so we called over there

364
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,140
and I went over to their office,

365
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:50,783
to run some ideas by their
content standards executive.

366
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,710
Hi there--
- Hi!

367
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:54,950
- How are ya?
- Good, how are you?

368
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,550
- Thanks for having me.

369
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,410
- Of course--
- Appreciate it.

370
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:00,060
So I was reading about these new rules

371
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:00,990
that you guys have--
- Yes.

372
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,790
- With the YouTube challenges.

373
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,330
And I'm a little bit concerned about it

374
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:07,030
because we do a lot of that
kind of stuff on the show.

375
00:14:08,054 --> 00:14:09,430
- Well I mean we trust what you do,

376
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,810
that's a different situation--
- Well that's great news.

377
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,222
So I can do anything?

378
00:14:13,222 --> 00:14:14,359
- Well I wouldn't say anything,

379
00:14:14,359 --> 00:14:15,447
but I think--
- Okay, well let me--

380
00:14:15,447 --> 00:14:16,280
- I think usually--
- Let me run some things

381
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,490
by you and you can just tell me,

382
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,010
because there are things we're working on

383
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:21,810
and I don't wanna get
into it, and you know.

384
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:26,055
Okay, the I bet you can't
eat all the knives challenge.

385
00:14:26,055 --> 00:14:30,430
- (audience laughing) Well,
no I would say not that one.

386
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,070
- Really, that's a no?
- Not that one.

387
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,393
- The setting my brother
on fire challenge.

388
00:14:34,393 --> 00:14:36,330

That sounds dangerous, no.

389
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,860
- Dad, I boiled the toaster challenge.

390
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,754
- No--

391
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:41,587

392

402
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:05,500
All right, can I borrow
your pencil for a second?

403
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,192
Thank you very much--
- Well, we would need to,

404
00:15:08,192 --> 00:15:09,600

but not that R. Kelly style,

412

- No, I mean I know about
them when they happen

605
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:02,050
but this whole award season
thing, it's been quite,

606
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:03,360
it's been an education, I have--

607
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,970
- In what way has it been an education?

608
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:07,180
- Because, well first of all
I didn't realize there were

609
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:11,140
so many different film critics
circle association reviews

610

and all of that.
- Right.

611
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:15,210
- Had no idea, kind of just thought,

612
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:18,180
the film critics, they're the
critics, they're the crew,

613
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,640
they're all together--
- They're one mass.

614

615
00:23:20,681 --> 00:23:21,514

620
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,783
about some of them but
I'm like, thank you!

621
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:40,390
- I know at this point
you probably have to give

622
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:42,544
some of them away to
neighbors or something right?

623
00:23:42,544 --> 00:23:44,070
- Nooooo!
- Because you're--

624
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:46,490
- They're mine! (audience laughing)

625
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:47,727
My name--
- You're gonna keep

626
00:23:47,727 --> 00:23:49,090
all of them--
- And I'm gonna keep them all!

627
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:51,220
- Even the Oklahoma Film Critics Circle?

628
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:54,650

629
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:57,050
- That's the one, yeah! (laughs)

630
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:58,177
- Never would've saw that one coming!

631
00:23:58,177 --> 00:24:00,930
- Are there enough film
critics in Oklahoma,

632
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:03,040
to form a circle? (audience applauding)

633
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,400
- I'm sure there are about eight.

634
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,670
- They're are probably--
- Yeah, at least.

635
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,668
- Well congratulations either way.

636
00:24:07,668 --> 00:24:09,480
- Thank you.
- Do you run out of speeches?

637
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,200
Do you run out of things to say?

638
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,110
- I hope not, because I hope to be able

639
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:19,820
to continue to do work
that receives accolades,

640
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:23,470
but I just say a prayer,

641
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:28,010
and just make, please,
just don't let me slub,

642
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:30,620
or say something silly--
- Do you plan it out

643
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,430
beforehand, do you write something down

644
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:33,810
before you go--
- I don't, I feel like

645
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:35,650
that's jinxin' the whole thing.

646
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:36,483
- Interesting,

647
00:24:36,483 --> 00:24:37,316
I think that's true, yes.
- Yeah, because--

648
00:24:37,316 --> 00:24:39,280
- 'Cause there's nothin' more embarrassing

649
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,887
then gettin' home that night--
- And look at that paper,

650
00:24:41,887 --> 00:24:45,300
and you're go like, yeah--
- And you go like, oh.

651
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,163
- Yeah, it's preparing for failure.

652
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,660
- Yeah, and the only thing about that is

653
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,490
there's always someone that you forget.

654
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:56,910
- Yes, right, you have to
remember everyone's name or else--

655
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:59,060
- Or you get names wrong.

656
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,820
- Oh, have you done that?
- I did.

657
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,950
- Do you think you need to thank anyone

658
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:05,281
who's name you don't
know how to pronounce?

659
00:25:05,281 --> 00:25:07,840
(audience laughing)

660
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,730
- I say call them by their first name.

661
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:11,350
- I say that--
- Just 'cause usually

662
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,860
the last names are the doozies.

663
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,990
But I say just the first name.

664
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:19,193
- That's very, but most people
don't have this problem.

665
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,300
- They call them
champaign problems, right?

666
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,560
- Yeah, that's right.
- Okay.

667
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,460
- By the way happy birthday,

668
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,900
I know it was your birthday on Tuesday,

669
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,582
I saw--
- Thank you!

670
00:25:27,582 --> 00:25:31,080
(audience cheering and applauding)

671
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,880
- Did they give you awards for that too,

672
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,620
or did you get gifts, or what did you do

673
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,330
for your birthday--
- I did, I did!

674
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:38,170
I got a lotta liquor!
- You did?

675
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:41,303
Yeah, I don't know what
that says about me, but--

676
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,190
- People give you bottles?
- Yes.

677
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:45,790
- Yeah, interesting.
- Nice bottles.

678
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:46,710
- And then when they give to you

679
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:50,010
do you open it up right away, and enjoy?

680
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:51,187
- No, I take my time--
- You take your time.

681
00:25:51,187 --> 00:25:53,040
- I like to open them up with people.

682
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,110
- Did you have a party or anything?

683
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,360
- I did not have a party,

684
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:01,360
I had a party of one at the
spa, for about four hours.

685
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,730
It was so sweet because my masseuse,

686
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,527
she was walking me and she goes,

687
00:26:06,527 --> 00:26:08,817
"I know I'm not supposed to say this,

688
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:11,650
"but I'm just so happy for you!"

689
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:14,180
- Oh really?
- And it was just so,

690
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,940
the amount of love that
I'm getting from people--

691
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,887
- Well you thank your
masseuse at the Oscars!

692
00:26:19,887 --> 00:26:21,360
(audience laughing)

693
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,394
Do you remember her first name?

694
00:26:23,394 --> 00:26:25,271
- No! (Jimmy laughs)

695
00:26:25,271 --> 00:26:28,160
- I wanna thank Miranda
for the deep tissue.

696
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,616
- Yes, yes! (audience laughing)

697
00:26:29,616 --> 00:26:31,466
You really got up in those shoulders!

698
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,630
- You might run out of people to thank

699
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,210
with all these awards, it's crazy!

700
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:37,650
- I don't think I'll run
out of people to thank--

701
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:39,520
- Who were you excited to
meet at the Golden Globes?

702
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,780
Is there anyone you had not met

703
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,540
or are these the same
people every single time?

704
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,840
- Okay, here's the thing.

705
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,780
This whole award season thing,

706
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:48,780
you're seeing a lot of the same people

707
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:52,550
and then you also see people
that you're a huge fan of,

708
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:56,030
and I normally don't up to people

709
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:59,700
and ask to take pictures,
just because I feel like

710
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,550
if they're not very nice people
then they've just destroyed

711
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,820
what's in my head--
- They'll ruin it for you--

712
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:07,840
- So, I decided to go against everything

713
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,870
that I know when I saw Sam Elliott.

714
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,960
- Sam Elliott, yeah!

715
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,910
Oh, you love Sam Elliott!
(audience laughing)

716
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:16,050
- Can you tell?

717
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:18,280
- Yeah, Sam Elliott's a real sex symbol,

718
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,940
kind of an under the radar sex symbol.

719
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:24,131
- Oh my God, I love that man!
- Did you tell him that?

720
00:27:24,131 --> 00:27:25,642
- I did!
- Was he delighted?

721
00:27:25,642 --> 00:27:29,440
- I did, he was just so
charming and so wonderful,

722
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,930
and even better than I had hoped

723
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:33,430
that he would be in the moment,

724
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:35,933
and the mustache is real!
- Oh yeah!

725
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:39,063
- It's just like, it's perfect!

726
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:44,498
And I just said, I love Roadhouse!

727
00:27:44,498 --> 00:27:47,750
(audience laughing)
- That's the one huh?

728
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:51,570
- My sister and I used to watch Roadhouse,

729
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,810
oh my God!
- How old were you?

730
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:55,630
- I don't know, way too young to--

731
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:56,890
- To be watching Roadhouse.
- To have the thoughts

732
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:58,990
that I had about Sam Elliott--
- Oh, wow!

733
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,450
- But--
- So it looks like Sam

734
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:03,070
won a little somethin' too then.

735
00:28:04,289 --> 00:28:06,320
When we come back, we're gonna
see a clip from your movie.

736
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,490

- So cute--
- Best buds.

741
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,380
- Wait, who's lured out
there in the background?

742
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,163
- Did you--
- Boca, my child?

743
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,700
- That's totally unintentional--

744
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,503
- Why do you hate Jacob?
- What?

745
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:32,260
No, look, I can, un-Boca, see?

746
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,653
Boca, un-Boca.

747
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:37,711
- Wow.
(quiet whistling)

748
00:28:37,711 --> 00:28:39,511
What kind of person, Boca's a child.

749
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,480
- I would never Boca your child.

750
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:45,360
Just so you know.

help hide my bladder leak pad.

759
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,180
Like the old tunic tuck.

760

But Always Discreet is less bulky,

761
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:11,180
and it really protects,
'cause it turns liquid to gel.

762

(upbeat jazz music)

788
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:13,950
- You're going to Hollywood!

789
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,393
- Pain wants to stop you.

790
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,283
Block you.

791
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,220
Like that's gonna happen.

792
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,380
Icy Hot.

793
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,610
Icy to dull, hot to relax.

794
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:26,204
Rise from pain. (swishing)

795

Icy Hot.

797
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,810
- I just checked my credit.

798
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:31,660
- Checkin' hurts it you know.

799
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:32,493
- A lot of people say

800
00:30:32,493 --> 00:30:34,170
that checking your credit can hurt it.

801
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:35,550
That's like believing that it takes

802
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:37,270
me seven years to digest.

803
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,500
It's just not true.

804
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,340
Adios! Oooohhhh!

805
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,310
- [TV Announcer] Check

00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,631
Here's to progress.

808
00:30:43,631 --> 00:30:46,639
(shopping carts clanging)

809
00:30:46,639 --> 00:30:47,710
- A pain cream!

810
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:50,640
Honey you smell just
like my Walter used to.

811
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,120
- [TV Announcer] Don't smell like Walter!

812
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,600
Aspercreme is odor-free.

813
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,407
For maximum pain relief,
without that Walter smell.

814
00:30:56,407 --> 00:30:57,240
Aspercreme!

815
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,313
No pain, no odor.

816
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:02,410
- As a fitness junkie,
I customize everything.

saddle,

820
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,000
that's why I switched to Liberty Mutual.

821
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,303
They customize my insurance
so I only pay for what I need.

822
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:14,753
I insured my car, and my bike.

823
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:20,033
My calves are custom too,
but I can't insure those.

824
00:31:21,282 --> 00:31:22,990
Which is a crying shame.

825
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:25,548
- [TV Announcer] Only
pay for what you need.

826
00:31:25,548 --> 00:31:27,103

- I had this chest cold but
my medicine kept wearing off.

829
00:31:31,581 --> 00:31:34,070
(coughing) Ahh!
- I missed you!

830
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,840
- Then I discovered Mucinex.

831
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,410
One pill lasts 12 hours, and I'm good.

832
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:39,760
- [TV Announcer] Mucinex releases fast

833
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,980
and lasts 12 hours, not four.

834
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,497
Let's end this.

835
00:31:43,497 --> 00:31:47,460
(inspirational music)

836
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:50,880

connecting to the Wi-Fi

841
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:01,710
ever slow down your business?

842
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:03,560
- Yes, it does slow things down.

843
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,130
- Aggravating.
- It's a nightmare.

844
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:07,140
- So our gig speed network is fast,

845
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,940
and we go beyond fast by making it easy

846
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,960
to create separate
networks for your business

847
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,090
and your customers, and even control

848
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:14,930
how much bandwidth each of those get.

849
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,790
So your business won't miss a beat.

850
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:17,623
- This is a big game changer.

851
00:32:17,623 --> 00:32:19,680
- This is the new wave,
and whoever doesn't get on,

852
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,900
I think they would be left behind.

853
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,680

(telephone ringing)

859
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,650
- Remember the way we used to do things?

860
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:32,483
- Hey man!

861
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:35,340
- Like connect with friends.
- Dig it.

862
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:37,370
- Or get in shape.

863
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:39,520
Or sell a house,

864
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,472
and pay a real estate
agent a big commission.

865

So you sell for thousands
more, than the one next door.

Don't get stuck in the past.

882
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:24,623
He's your grandchild.

883
00:33:26,401 --> 00:33:30,557
I don't understand you,
it's your grandchild.

884
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:34,953
What difference does it
make how he gets here?

885
00:33:34,953 --> 00:33:37,780
The child ain't got
nothin' to do with that.

886
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:40,023
Ain't non of us got

If Beale Street could talk

This is a movie directed and
written by Barry Jenkins--

890
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:51,360
- Yes.
- Who did Moonlight,

891
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,290
and obviously won the
Academy Award for that.

892
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:58,310
When you're playing a mom in
the 70s, do you get excited

893
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:01,793
about the hairstyle,
'cause there are many--

894
00:34:02,726 --> 00:34:04,120
- There are many--
- Ways you could go with that.

895
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,697
- There's a lot of ways to go.

896
00:34:05,697 --> 00:34:10,160
I do and it's so interesting,
because there's a whole story

897
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,710
and I hope I can get it all in.

898
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:14,850
I wanted like an Afro--

899
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:16,770
- That's what I would have too.

900
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:18,740
- And Barry's like, "Yeah, no."

901
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,320
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, yeah!

902
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,920
- Why no?
- And was like, but you know

903
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:25,900
I'm no longer doing anything
like pressing my hair out.

904
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:29,914
I've got an Afro Barry,
that the world wants to see.

905
00:34:29,914 --> 00:34:30,940
(audience laughing)

906
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,330
But he was like, "I
appreciate that, but no."

907
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:35,320
- No Afro--
- And so,

908
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,770
he really started sending pictures

909
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:39,690
of women that he felt visually,

910
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:44,690
Sharon is the role that I
play, would be, and I got it.

911
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:50,700
It made sense, and him
sharing that just turned into,

912
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:53,260
it made me understand the character--

913
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:55,154
- It started with the hair, and then--

914
00:34:55,154 --> 00:34:57,017
- It started with the hair.
- Yeah, that's something else.

915
00:34:57,017 --> 00:34:58,240
- Worked our way on down.

916
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,190
- I wanna ask you about something

917
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,800
you probably can't talk about at all,

918
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,230
which is Watchmen on HBO.

919
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,943
This is a show loosely based,

920
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,180
and we don't really know exactly--

921
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,980
- Exactly what it's based on--
- What it is, but you did

922
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:12,090
The Leftovers with Damon Lindelof--

923
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:14,900
- Yes--
- And that's a fantastic show,

924
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:19,900
and Damon is now running this
show, and writing this show,

925
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,400
are you the only person from The Leftovers

926
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,530
that he took with him to Watchmen?

927
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:27,520
- Well--
- Yeah!

928
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,970
- Yes.
- What can you tell us

929
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:31,173
about what you're up to on that show?

930
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:33,763
Anything?

931
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,250
Can you tell us which character you play?

932
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:39,800
- I can tell you, that I'm a woman.

933
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,590
- Okay?
(audience cheering)

934
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:43,710
- And that

935
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:47,780
I am maybe

936
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,703
somewhat of a badass?
- Okay.

937
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,210
- And I

938
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:55,190
may

939
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,790
have some scenes

940
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:59,953
with some really awesome actors.

941
00:36:01,303 --> 00:36:03,330
(audience laughing)
- That's it huh?

942
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:05,990
Can you tell us anything

943
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:07,940
about the story

944
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:12,203
and in what era it will take place?

945
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,390
Sorry, this is real nerd stuff

946
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:15,770
and I need to get to the bottom of it.

947
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:19,483

of your ulcerative colitis,

1144

A pill, not an injection or infusion.

1148

severe ulcerative colitis,

and monitor certain liver tests.

1166
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:37,853
Tell your doctor

1167
00:44:37,853 --> 00:44:39,840
if you're been somewhere
fungal infections are common,

1168
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,960
and if you've had TB, hepatitis B or C,

(rock music)

1282
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:24,100
- How're you doin'?

1283
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:25,770
Everything all right?
- I'm good man.

1284
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:28,130
- Family is good?
- Aah, the family is so good!

1285
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:30,027
- I know you live here in L.A.

1286
00:49:30,027 --> 00:49:32,440
Did you bring the whole family to New York

1287
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,800
when you were shooting The Punisher?

1288
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:37,610
- No I bring, I guess
I bring my dog family.

1289
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:39,540
I don't bring, the humans stay home.

1290
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:40,930
- I see--
- Yeah, the dogs--

1291
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:43,440
- The humans stay home--
- The babies stay home man,

1292
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,400
but the dogs definitely come.

1293
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,730
We hightail it across the country.

1294
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:49,540
We can't put 'em on planes so we drive.

1295
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:50,730
- Oh you do?
- We do--

1296
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:51,573
- Is that fun?

1297
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:55,023
- You know, it's a mixed bag.

1298
00:49:55,870 --> 00:49:58,300
I drive with my old man--
- Oh, really?

1299
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:00,420
- I do, I do, which is, look.

1300
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:01,980
My old man is the greatest dad on earth.

1301
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:03,850
I love my dad with all my heart.

1302
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:06,241
And what, right on!

1303
00:50:06,241 --> 00:50:09,027
(audience applauding)

1304
00:50:09,027 --> 00:50:11,047
And you know, for a 70-year old guy

1305
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:15,550
to just pick up and drive cross-country

1306
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:18,790
with three pit-bulls,
that's somethin' man.

1307
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:22,090
But I'll tell you there are
specific rules and regulations

1308
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:24,070
for driving cross-country with my old man.

1309
00:50:24,070 --> 00:50:24,923
- Oh he has rules!
- Oh, yeah!

1310
00:50:24,923 --> 00:50:26,940
Well first of all you're
not gonna do any driving,

1311
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,070
which is great, right?
- He drives the whole time--

1312
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:29,903
- He drives the whole time.

1313
00:50:29,903 --> 00:50:30,940
You ain't touchin' the wheel right?

1314
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:32,160
Which is cool, because it's like

1315
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,480
havin' a personal driver, right?

1316
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,730
But I'm gonna tell you right now.

1317
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:39,260
Jimmy, if you even think
about turning on that radio,

1318
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:41,160
I know it doesn't matter
whether it's music,

1319
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,950
it doesn't matter whether it's news,

1320
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:46,690
you will get smacked, with this man hand!

1321
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:49,070
My old man's got those thick, hairy,

1322
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:51,140
just one, you touch that dial, bam!

1323
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:51,973
You know what I mean?

1324
00:50:51,973 --> 00:50:53,460
And that's just a day ruiner right there.

1325
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:55,650
- Well why doesn't he--
- He's just, he's got--

1326
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:57,500
- He wants silence in the car?
- He's just very specific.

1327
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:00,050
Look, when you stop for gas,

1328
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:01,897
that is your time to go to the bathroom,

1329
00:51:01,897 --> 00:51:04,110
it's time for the dogs
to go to the bathroom,

1330
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:06,060
that's where you're gettin'
your food and your coffee.

1331
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:09,260
If you think about, like a
Starbucks, not gonna happen.

1332
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:10,863
All of a sudden, you're Hollywood man!

1333
00:51:10,863 --> 00:51:14,167
Like oh, mister self-serve
Hollywood needs a Starbucks!

1334
00:51:14,167 --> 00:51:17,310
(Jimmy laughs) You just get
ripped apart, and it's not like

1335
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:20,220
I'm gettin' a Caramel Macchiato
man, I want a black coffee,

1336
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:23,782
and he's just like, he's not happening--

1337
00:51:23,782 --> 00:51:24,843
- Are you allowed to talk
to to him in the car?

1338
00:51:24,843 --> 00:51:28,433
- Yes, you are I guess,
and that's the thing.

1339
00:51:28,433 --> 00:51:30,480
Like I always think we're gonna have

1340
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,923
these deep kind of
father-son bonding moments,

1341
00:51:34,253 --> 00:51:37,669
and we start to sometime,
the thing is that

1342
00:51:37,669 --> 00:51:40,080
he is constantly screaming at
every one else on the road.

1343
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:42,650
Like he's in a huge rut, and
we say things I definitely

1344
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:46,010
can't say here, but like he's
just driving with hatred!

1345
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:48,270
The entire way across the
country, and it's like--

1346
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:49,820
It just kinda interrupts the moment!

1347
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:51,610
- Yeah sure, yeah!

1348
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:54,320
Does your dad think he's
a good road trip partner?

1349
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,270
- I think he would
probably consider himself

1350
00:51:56,270 --> 00:51:58,270
the best in the business. (Jimmy laughing)

1351
00:51:58,270 --> 00:51:59,700
I think like, and look the truth is look,

1352
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:03,870
he drives fast as hell,
he knows how to go--

1353
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:05,710
- How many days from L.A. to New York?

1354
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:07,520
- He goes straight man,
that man does not stop.

1355
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,870
- Really--
- You do not stop that man--

1356
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:10,280
- So you do it in like
two and a half days?

1357
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:12,163
- My man, my man, that's it.

1358
00:52:12,163 --> 00:52:15,760
- Wow, wow, maybe you should
get him a job with Uber

1359
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,370
or something, you know?
- Oh boy, oh boy--

1360
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:19,540
- It seems like he would
be the ideal driver--

1361
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:20,650
- Yeah, just don't touch the radio.

1362
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:23,050
- So, The Punisher is a rare,

1363
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:25,560
for those who don't follow,
I know all this stuff

1364
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:26,980
and it's all worthless information,

1365
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:29,580
but the rare Marvel character

1366
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:33,310
who doesn't really have
powers necessarily,

1367
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:36,043
do you feel cheated in any way about that?

1368
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:40,910
- Look, I love Frank Castle.

1369
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:43,650
He's a character that has resonated deeply

1370
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:44,860
with the military community

1371
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:47,076
and the law enforcement community,

1372
00:52:47,076 --> 00:52:47,930
and it's been an honor to play him.

1373
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:49,870
I wouldn't have it any other way.

1374
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:51,830
- Do you love those days that you get

1375
00:52:51,830 --> 00:52:53,340
to beat people up on set?

1376
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:54,173
Is that fun?

1377
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:58,910
- You know man, two things
that I've sworn to myself

1378
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:01,500
that I will never do--
- What are they?

1379
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:04,047
- Come on a show like
this, and talk about, not,

1380
00:53:04,047 --> 00:53:06,510
I'm here, but talk about--
- Not that part--

1381
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:07,343
- No, not that part!

1382
00:53:07,343 --> 00:53:09,257
- Come on a show like this, that one--

1383
00:53:09,257 --> 00:53:10,980
- Come on a show like this and talk

1384
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:12,880
about how I do my own stunts,

1385
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,290
or how I get injured doing stunts.

1386
00:53:14,290 --> 00:53:15,910
But, I'm gonna do both of those things--

1387
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:17,150
- Okay yeah, go ahead--
- Here's the thing.

1388
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:20,360
I like to do all my own stunts,

1389
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:21,550
I like to do the fighting myself,

1390
00:53:21,550 --> 00:53:23,930
I think it's important for the audience

1391
00:53:23,930 --> 00:53:26,750
to see Frank Castle in
those moments, and I did,

1392
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:30,600
I broke my hand pretty bad
in the first fight scene

1393
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,020
of the season this year--
- Oh, great.

1394
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:34,200
- Yeah, and I knew
exactly when it happened,

1395
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,800
it was a three-day fight scene,
and it was the first day,

1396
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,630
and I hit somebody and
I knew, I'm a boxer,

1397
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:40,250
I knew immediately it was broken.

1398
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:41,760
But me being the orangutan I am

1399
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,960
I didn't say anything to anyone

1400
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,110
'cause I didn't wanna get pulled.

1401
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:45,610
I wanted to stay in the fight.

1402
00:53:47,148 --> 00:53:48,030
And so the very next thing I had to do

1403
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:50,300
with a broken hand was,
my name Jordan Scott,

1404
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:52,430
a stunt performer, he had to take my hand,

1405
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:54,010
and I had a knife and he had to bash

1406
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:57,526
my broken hand into a table,
and I'm The Punisher man,

1407
00:53:57,526 --> 00:54:00,020
it can't just be two
hits, he's gotta like bash

1408
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:01,440
the hell out of my hand on the table.

1409
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,480
And so I go to the stunt
coordinator, Eric Linden.

1410
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,410
I said, hey man is there anyway

1411
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:05,620
we can switch it to the left hand?

1412
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:06,453
He goes, "What're you doin' man?

1413
00:54:06,453 --> 00:54:07,947
"Stay on script, no the
camera's over there,

1414
00:54:07,947 --> 00:54:09,310
"like do it, man up!"

1415
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:11,410
All right, ma-bam, ma-bam, ma-bam!

1416
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:13,500
Now I got torn ligaments in my hand right?

1417
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,300
So the next thing I
gotta do is I gotta kick

1418
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:16,327
this guy's leg out and he falls down

1419
00:54:16,327 --> 00:54:19,560
and I gotta catch him
right in my poor hand,

1420
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:22,620
and I say to him again, hey
man, is there just any chance

1421
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:24,050
we could just move this to the left hand?

1422
00:54:24,050 --> 00:54:25,630
And a perfect opportunity to just say,

1423
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:27,223
hey man, my hand's injured--
- Right--

1424
00:54:27,223 --> 00:54:29,520
- I didn't say it, and
so I said all right,

1425
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,070
this is gonna suck, here we go!

1426
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:35,210
And like my hand, and then
now I've dislocated my hand!

1427
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:37,720
And the very last thing that
we had to do in the scene,

1428
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:40,940
on day three, is these
guys are shooting at me

1429
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:44,210
with automatic weapons and
I throw a bar stool at them.

1430
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:45,070
I don't know, I didn't write it

1431
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:46,400
but that what we got right?
(Jimmy laughs)

1432
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,188
And so I go, I gotta--
- Sit on this now!

1433
00:54:49,188 --> 00:54:52,120
(audience laughing)

1434
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:54,970
- I go to grab this bar
stool, and I just freeze,

1435
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:57,330
'cause I know with this
mangled mess of a hand

1436
00:54:57,330 --> 00:54:59,820
I'm not gonna be able to throw the stool.

1437
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:01,147
Stunt coordinator comes over again,

1438
00:55:01,147 --> 00:55:02,837
"Come on man, man up and
throw the damn stool,

1439
00:55:02,837 --> 00:55:04,300
"what is the matter with you?"

1440
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:05,330
Oh God, all right, here we go--

1441
00:55:05,330 --> 00:55:06,507
- You're not being
treated well on the set--

1442
00:55:06,507 --> 00:55:09,010
- No, no, no, he's the best,
I should've said something.

1443
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:11,470
And the thing is, the
directors and the producers,

1444
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:13,380
they're all watching the
scene in Video Village

1445
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:15,210
looking this way, and they don't see

1446
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:16,550
when I grab it with my left hand

1447
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:18,460
I'm supposed to throw that thing at a mat,

1448
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:20,510
but instead I just chucked that thing

1449
00:55:20,510 --> 00:55:22,700
and all of a sudden you hear
this (exclaiming loudly)

1450
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:24,860
and it hit that stunt coordinator

1451
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:25,770
right in the leg! (audience laughing)

1452
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:27,070
And that's somethink you
go to the hospital with!

1453
00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:30,345
Again!
- He's gotta man up!

1454
00:55:30,345 --> 00:55:34,360
Went to the hospital!
(audience applauding)

1455
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,744
One non Punisher related
question for you--

1456
00:55:36,744 --> 00:55:37,820
- What do you got--

1457
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:41,680
- I read on Monday, and
this is very exciting.

1458
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,940
David Chase is going to do a movie,

1459
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:47,350
a prequel to The Sopranos, and I read

1460
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:49,020
that you are going to be in it.

1461
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:54,020
Will you be in this
film? (audience laughing)

1462
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,820
You do know what I'm talking about?

1463
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:58,263
You've seen the article?

1464
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:00,910
You're nodding yes, does that mean yes,

1465
00:56:00,910 --> 00:56:02,633
I am gonna be in this film?

1466
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:05,604
It does mean yes right there!

1467
00:56:05,604 --> 00:56:09,854
(audience cheering and applauding)

1468
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:13,760
Well if you break anything on that set,

1469
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,850
please tell David Chase,
or something like that.

1470
00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:17,830
- I give you my word.
- I think your father,

1471
00:56:17,830 --> 00:56:19,540
made you silent about things
that you shouldn't be.

1472
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:21,170
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Well it's great to see you.

1473
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:23,647

look smashing this morning.

1482

1489
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:02,384
There have been days,
when you doubted yourself.

(camera clicking)

1491
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,693
And days when you were ready to quit.

1492
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:08,583
But you didn't!

1493
00:57:08,583 --> 00:57:10,950
Because you had the courage,

1494
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:13,810
to venture into something powerful.

1495
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:15,140
Education!

1496
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:18,270
If I leave you with just
three words of advice,

1497
00:57:18,270 --> 00:57:19,239
never

1498
00:57:19,239 --> 00:57:20,072
stop

1499
00:57:20,072 --> 00:57:20,905
