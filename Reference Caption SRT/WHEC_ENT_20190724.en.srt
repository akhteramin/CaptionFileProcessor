1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,833
- Instances removed,

2
00:00:00,833 --> 00:00:02,370
and they don't have
that privilege anymore,

3
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:03,360
they're extremely upset.

4
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,290
They have to rely on friends
and neighbors and family.

5
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:07,930
Families for rides.

6
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:09,020
But I would say, as sheriff,

7
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,684
my number one priority
is keeping the road safe.

8
00:00:11,684 --> 00:00:13,010
(typing)

9
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:13,843
- [Berkeley] I wanted to know

10
00:00:13,843 --> 00:00:16,240
how many reports are filed every year?

11
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,290
How many drivers lose their license,

12
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:20,150
and why does one person get a road test,

13
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:22,754
like Rosalee, and another driver doesn't?

14
00:00:22,754 --> 00:00:25,760
The State DMV would not answer
those specific questions,

15
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,347
but wrote in an email, quote,

16
00:00:27,347 --> 00:00:30,327
"The thorough review process
allows a driver to demonstrate

17
00:00:30,327 --> 00:00:34,077
"their fitness to drive and
helps the DMV ensure safety

18
00:00:34,077 --> 00:00:36,837
"on New York's roadways
for all who use them,

19
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:38,410
"which is our top priority".

20
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,570
How has this impacted your life?

21
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,623
- I need to be independent.

22
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,180
And I've always been independent.

23
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:48,470
What can I say?

24
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,640
- Berkeley Brean, News 10, NBC.

25
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,180
- More plans were announced today

26
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,770
for Skyview on the Ridge,

27
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:56,780
the redevelopment of the
former Irondequoit Mall.

28
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,540
St. Ann's community will expand

29
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:02,280
their adult day care health
service there in 2020.

30
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,490
They provide care for older adults

31
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:06,170
and people with disabilities.

32
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,280
St. Ann's says there is a growing need

33
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,500
for adult day health care
services in our community.

34
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,440
And the new location will double

35
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,560
the number of people that can be served.

36
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,710
- [Reporter] Now, your
First Alert forecast

37
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,130
with meteorologist Robert Speta,

38
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:24,260
featuring Rochester's
only live local radar,

39
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,170
First Alert Doppler 10,

40
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,743
powered by AP Plumbing.

41
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,620
- A rather nice evening
out here in Rochester.

42
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,070
This is overlooking the Genesee River

43
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,550
there in Charlotte.

44
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,270
We're still looking at nice weather

45
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,180
through the rest of the week.

46
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,000
It will start to warm up
by the end of the week,

47
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,860
and even become a little bit more muggy,

48
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,040
with rain returning by
Sunday night, into Monday.

49
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,320
But here's the key thing,

50
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,370
over the next few days,

51
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:50,620
there is nothing severe in the forecast,

52
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,610
and even into the weekend as well.

53
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,470
I got green across the board here

54
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,520
on that News 10 NBC threat tracker.

55
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,270
But right now, any rain
we had earlier on today,

56
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,710
it's been pushed towards the south,

57
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,760
thanks to the lake breeze,

58
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,150
keeping things pretty
clear through tonight.

59
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,770
60 degrees for our low,

60
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:08,300
it's gonna be a pleasant
night in the forecast.

61
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,740
Heading through tomorrow,

62
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,230
we're gonna be looking
at those temperatures

63
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:14,000
warming up to about 78 to 82 degrees,

64
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,960
with mostly sunny skies by 5:00 p.m.

65
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,050
By the way, that is Remo, or Rehmo,

66
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,130
I hope I'm saying it right,

67
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,300
I'm gonna say both of 'em.

68
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,640
He a nice dog, he's ready
to go for a ride there,

69
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,580
on the dog walking forecast.

70
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,000
Always do remember these images

71
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,400
are sent in by that WHEC weather app.

72
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,233
All right, let's take a look

73
00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:32,720
at those temperatures across the board

74
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,553
for the high tomorrow.

75
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:36,660
A little bit cooler near the lake shore,

76
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,994
we got 79 in Irondequoit,

77
00:02:37,994 --> 00:02:40,100
74 only in Sodus.

78
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,390
Meanwhile, in the Canandaigua
could be upwards of

79
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,570
about 80 degrees for your high.

80
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:47,050
You got the Ontario County
Fair going on there.

81
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:51,530
80 in Geneva, and Dansville
about 77 for your high.

82
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,950
You have that chance of an isolated shower

83
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,190
by the afternoon,

84
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,130
down into the Finger Lakes as well.

85
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,330
Be very, very local,

86
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:00,100
because this high area of high pressure

87
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,010
is finally gonna drift towards the East,

88
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,390
and really just dominate,

89
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,710
starting on Thursday and Friday,

90
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,010
and also into Saturday.

91
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,310
And the more it dominates,

92
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:11,210
the less likely we have of
scattered showers out there.

93
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,915
So Thursday, there is a small chance.

94
00:03:12,915 --> 00:03:15,270
But then eventually by
Friday into Saturday,

95
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,591
this just comes on overhead.

96
00:03:16,591 --> 00:03:18,240
I know this is picking up on rain,

97
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,660
but I don't have it on the forecast.

98
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,610
I think this is gonna be
suppressing it too much,

99
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,100
but eventually this front

100
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,375
is gonna work its way in by
Sunday night into Monday.

101
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,490
The high is gonna move out of the way,

102
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,220
and that influence from it

103
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,770
is gonna be going to the wayside,

104
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:36,714
and of course, that means
increase in rainfall,

105
00:03:36,714 --> 00:03:39,650
as we go ahead into the
early part of next week.

106
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:40,483
Especially Tuesday.

107
00:03:40,483 --> 00:03:42,040
Tuesday is looking like a messy one.

108
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,900
83, maybe even with a chance
for thunderstorm with that.

109
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,240
And Wednesday we're also looking
at some rainfall, as well.

110
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,660
But before that happens, boy oh boy,

111
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,990
this week, this week's looking brilliant.

112
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,860
I mean Thursday, Friday and Saturday,

113
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,130
all of the sunshine.

114
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,750
I think the only thing I could say

115
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,590
that you need to worry
about is the UV index.

116
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,730
You definitely wanna be aware of that,

117
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,870
get that sunblock ready to
go as the sun just comes out.

118
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,703
- Always

119
00:04:06,703 --> 00:04:08,200
- Yeah, yeah, especially
this time of year.

120
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,360
- Yeah, right.

121
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,339
All right, Robert, thank you.

122
00:04:10,339 --> 00:04:12,720
Well, it's a sign that football season

123
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,780
is almost here.

124
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,890
What you need to know about

125
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,500
the Buffalo Bills training camp,

126
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,110
if you plan on going.

127
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,950
Plus, which local county is opting out

128
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:25,360
of making you pay a tax for
paper bags at the grocery store.

129
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,410
But first, here's a look
at what we're working on

130
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,310
from News 10 NBC at 11.

131
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:33,660
The Rochester area is
experiencing a craft beer boom.

132
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,874
So where do our brewers
get their ingredients?

133
00:04:36,874 --> 00:04:41,130
Turns out a local hop
farm is a major supplier.

134
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,690
In our small business spotlight,

135
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,140
we take you to Cobblestone Hop Yard.

136
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,653
That's tonight, at 11.
