1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,337
- Honoring the very best of us.

2
00:00:01,337 --> 00:00:02,720
And that does it for this edition

3
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,470
of Andrea Mitchell Reports.

4
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,976
Here's Ali Velshi from Stephanie Ruhle.

5
00:00:06,976 --> 00:00:09,460
- Andrea, have yourself a
great afternoon, thank you.

6
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,590
And hello everyone, it's
Wednesday, July 3rd.

7
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,200
Coming up this hour on Velshi and Ruhle

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,260
the crisis at the border.

9
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,350
We've got new gut-wrenching
details about how children

10
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,980
are being are being treated in US custody.

11
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,650
It would be considered abuse
if it happened in a home.

12
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:24,370
So should immigration
officials be held to account?

13
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:25,960
Plus, President Trump says he's cutting

14
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,160
prescription drug prices.

15
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,620
For facts sake, thousands of
drug prices are skyrocketing.

16
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,500
We're gonna dig into the numbers for you.

17
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,270
And military tanks have
arrived on the national mall

18
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,750
for President Trump's
July 4th celebration.

19
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,670
We'll look at the cost, plus
concerns from the Pentagon.

20
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,120
Today President Trump is insisting

21
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,100
that his fight for adding
a citizenship question

22
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,097
to the census isn't over
yet, saying in a tweet quote,

23
00:00:47,097 --> 00:00:49,167
"The news reports about
the Department of Commerce

24
00:00:49,167 --> 00:00:52,467
"dropping it's quest to put
the citizenship question

25
00:00:52,467 --> 00:00:54,677
"on the census is incorrect or,

26
00:00:54,677 --> 00:00:57,077
"to state it differently, fake!

27
00:00:57,077 --> 00:00:59,817
"We are absolutely moving
forward, as we must,

28
00:00:59,817 --> 00:01:03,140
"because of the importance of
the answer to this question."

29
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,540
Now the statement, refuting his
very own commerce secretary,

30
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,319
Wilbur Ross who said, just 24
hours ago, this in part quote,

31
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,067
"The Census Bureau has started the process

32
00:01:12,067 --> 00:01:14,807
"of printing the decennial questionnaires

33
00:01:14,807 --> 00:01:16,427
"without the question.

34
00:01:16,427 --> 00:01:18,817
"My focus, and that of the
Bureau and the entire Department

35
00:01:18,817 --> 00:01:21,670
"is to conduct a complete
and accurate census."

36
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,850
All of this of course,
follows the Supreme Court

37
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,990
recent decision to block the
question from the 2020 Census.

38
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,050
Joining me now NBC's
White House correspondent,

39
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:30,883
Kelly O'Donnell.

40
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:33,680
Kelly, this one's a tricky one,

41
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,900
because while the president
often tweets things

42
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,390
that are at odds wit his administration

43
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,610
or his own government.

44
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:41,960
The Commerce Department
actually has to print the census

45
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,370
and the census actually has to go out.

46
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,400
This one seems to be easy to identify,

47
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,860
what the story actually is.

48
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,910
Why are the president and
the Commerce Department

49
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,690
not on the same page
about this, literally?

50
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:55,020
- Well, you could argue there
are two different tracks.

51
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,620
There's the practical piece
of having to print the census

52
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,380
with, in this case, no
question about citizenship

53
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,950
for those who participate,

54
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,340
because 2020 is knocking on our door,

55
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,330
in terms of the volume of
what it takes to do a census.

56
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,270
And in Wilbur Ross, the
secretary's own name,

57
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,600
you read the statement.

58
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,580
This is very clearly coming
from the Department of Commerce.

59
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,310
We also heard from Justice
Department officials,

60
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,490
who told us that it was going
forward with the printing.

61
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,150
So, where is the second level?

62
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,870
You could continue the legal challenge

63
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,970
and make it an issue
that could be resolved

64
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,690
at some later date or, arguably,

65
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,020
you could say you could
reprint portions of the census

66
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,620
or it could be for the next census.

67
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,990
It's unclear, the president
doesn't lay that out.

68
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,310
So, it appears to be
more political messaging

69
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,143
that the president,

70
00:02:42,143 --> 00:02:44,680
who has taken a very
strong position on this.

71
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,910
Just Monday, he was
asked about this question

72
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:48,810
in the Oval Office.

73
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,840
Would he attempt to delay the census,

74
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,090
which is required by the Constitution.

75
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,400
Not an everyday law,

76
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,600
the Constitution that it
be done every 10 years.

77
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,020
He said he was strongly looking at that.

78
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,810
So, the president wanting
to stick with that position,

79
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,730
but leaving, as he explained
in the Oval on Monday,

80
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,560
that this is a question
he believes is appropriate

81
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,450
and that it is the
country's right to know who,

82
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:13,810
among those participating,
is a citizen, who is not.

83
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,990
He didn't leave open the
possibility for non-citizens

84
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,440
who have permanent legal
status in the United States,

85
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,800
or those under protected
status, like asylum seekers,

86
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,490
he just had the either/or.

87
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,760
So, it would appear that
the government is doing

88
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,840
what the government needs
to do to begin that process

89
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,610
of the every 10 year check on
who and how many are among us.

90
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,240
And the president is still saying

91
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,550
he wants to fight this fight.

92
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,880
It may be part of his political argument.

93
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,910
It ties into so much else
of the president's rhetoric.

94
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,570
But there's a way for both to be true.

95
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,520
But what we have not yet
heard from the White House,

96
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,070
and we've inquired, is does
the president have a difference

97
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,010
on the actual printing part of this.

98
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:56,190
It would appear that ship is about to sail

99
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:59,440
from one of his closest
advisors, Wilbur Ross,

100
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,800
saying, it's gonna happen.

101
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,633
Ali.

102
00:04:01,633 --> 00:04:02,466
- Kelly, good to see you as always.

103
00:04:02,466 --> 00:04:04,130
Thank you Kelly O'Donnell
for us at the White House.

104
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:07,220
President Trump is celebrating
the acquittal of a Navy Seal

105
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,640
accused of murdering an ISIS fighter.

106
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,637
Just a short time ago
the president tweeted,

107
00:04:11,637 --> 00:04:14,187
"Congratulations to Navy
Seal Eddie Gallagher,

108
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,967
"his wonderful wife Andrea,
and his entire family.

109
00:04:16,967 --> 00:04:19,497
"You have been through much together.

110
00:04:19,497 --> 00:04:22,130
"Glad I could help!"

111
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,087
It's an interesting last line,

112
00:04:23,087 --> 00:04:24,510
"Glad I could help."

113
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,520
This was a trial, how
did the president help?

114
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,550
Gallagher was accused of stabbing to death

115
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:31,170
a young, wounded ISIS fighter in 2017.

116
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,920
Then posing for a picture with the corpse.

117
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,872
While Gallagher was found not guilty

118
00:04:35,872 --> 00:04:37,710
on six criminal charges,

119
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,260
he was found guilt of posing
for a photo with a casualty.

120
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,500
It was a trial with a stunning twist.

121
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,810
Another Navy Seal testified

122
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,070
that he was the one who killed the boy

123
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:52,030
by blocking his breathing
tube in an act of mercy.

124
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,170
Joining me now from San Diego,

125
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,790
NBC's Steve Patterson's been covering

126
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,700
the trial from the beginning.

127
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,100
Steve, what help is the
president talking about

128
00:04:59,100 --> 00:04:59,933
in that tweet?

129
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,720
- So, the president isn't
necessarily referring

130
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,810
to the trial itself.

131
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:09,170
He's referring to an act
that occurred in the past.

132
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:11,360
There was about a nine-month period

133
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,640
after Gallagher was
arrested on these very,

134
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,770
extremely serious charges for war crimes

135
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,210
over in a 2017 tour of
duty, as you mentioned,

136
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,630
in Mosul, in Iraq,

137
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,793
where he was taken to a military brig.

138
00:05:23,793 --> 00:05:27,650
Again, arrested in the fall,
I believe at his residence.

139
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:30,600
Taken to the brig and confined there

140
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,120
for a period of nearly a
year, about nine months.

141
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,540
The president takes credit for moving him

142
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,060
out of the brig and back home,

143
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,100
saying that the brig is only for people

144
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,800
that were flight risks

145
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,620
or that have significant
risk of harming someone

146
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,630
or themselves or, obviously,
leaving the country.

147
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,310
His argument was that
Gallagher was at risk

148
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,210
of doing none of that.

149
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,110
He, of course, referenced this,

150
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,640
as he does with most
everything, in a tweet.

151
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,297
Saying quote, "In honor of his
past service to our country,

152
00:06:02,297 --> 00:06:04,697
"Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher
will soon be moved to

153
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,807
"a less restrictive confinement

154
00:06:06,807 --> 00:06:08,107
"while he awaits his day in court.

155
00:06:08,107 --> 00:06:10,060
"Process should move quickly."

156
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,260
It did move quickly.

157
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:14,310
That was March, he was back
home shortly after that.

158
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:17,220
We spoke to members of
Gallagher's defense team

159
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,030
on their way into court this morning.

160
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:21,180
They were praising,
thanking President Trump

161
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,720
for doing this saying that it allowed them

162
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,700
to prepare a significant case,

163
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,230
that they were obviously
able to be successful

164
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,230
in so many of the charges here.

165
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,140
Saying that it was thanks to the president

166
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:35,680
that he allowed all this press to usher in

167
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,500
because of his exposure to the case.

168
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,510
So they're very happy
with the attention that

169
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,710
the president has given this case.

170
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:46,290
And, obviously, for whatever
he did to move Gallagher

171
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,620
from confinement to home
so they could prepare

172
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:51,220
for the trial that we
just experienced, Ali.

173
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,053
- All right Steve.

174
00:06:52,053 --> 00:06:55,650
Thanks very much, Steve
Patterson for us in Los Angeles.

175
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:58,200
All right, now to the
race for the White House.

176
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,410
Today, several Democratic
candidates are campaigning

177
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,860
in the key voter state of Iowa.

178
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,530
Former Vice President Joe
Biden's campaign just announced

179
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,970
it raised 21-1/2 million dollars

180
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,640
during it's second quarter alone.

181
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,500
This as Senator Kamala Harris
appears to be closing the gap

182
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,210
on Biden's lead days
after she challenged him

183
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:17,720
on his record with race issues
during the Democratic debate.

184
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,490
A new Quinnipiac University poll shows

185
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,860
Harris is up 13 points
in the last three weeks,

186
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,480
while front-runner Biden
is down eight points.

187
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,870
Harris stands at 20%, Biden at 22,

188
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,991
which is a virtual tie when you consider

189
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:31,540
the margin of error.

190
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,810
Senator Elizabeth Warren
and Bernie Sanders follow.

191
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:34,860
But according to the poll,

192
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,790
when voters were asked
who has the best chance

193
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,570
of winning against President Trump,

194
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:42,810
Biden maintains a strong
42%, Harris is at 14%.

195
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:45,910
In another poll from The
Washington Post and ABC News,

196
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:48,620
the biggest jump again
belongs to Senator Harris.

197
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,590
In that poll though,

198
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:52,390
Senator Bernie Sanders
holds on to second place.

199
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,410
Joining me now from
Iowas, our road warriors:

200
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,580
Vaughn Hillyard, Shaquille
Brewster and Mike Memoli.

201
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,940
Mike, you're following
Joe Biden in Iowa today,

202
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,800
let's talk about the
second quarter for him

203
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,670
in terms of fundraising compared to

204
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,470
the other candidates we know so far.

205
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,930
- Yeah Ali, well we saw last week

206
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,710
the downsides of being the front runner.

207
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,660
In that debate, Joe Biden
put on the defensive

208
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,750
by some of his opponents.

209
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,480
And so, as he arrives today in Iowa

210
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,130
for his first real campaign
rally since the debate,

211
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,050
a little bit of a show of
force from the Biden campaign,

212
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,337
announcing that second-quarter
fundraising number:

213
00:08:21,337 --> 00:08:24,520
$21.5 million dollars
since he entered the race

214
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,410
in late April.

215
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,380
I should mention, it's not as
much as Mayor Pete Buttigeig,

216
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,640
who reported raising more than 25 million.

217
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,110
Bernie Sanders also with
a number of 18 million.

218
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,150
But that's more on a per-day basis,

219
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,550
the Biden campaign points out,

220
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,960
noting that he didn't get
in until three weeks into,

221
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,360
after the fundraising quarter began.

222
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,250
I'll read a few of the
statistics highlighted

223
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,083
by the Biden campaign.

224
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,670
Of course, NBC News has
been keeping a close track

225
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,260
of those high-dollar fundraisers.

226
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,065
27 that he's done since announcing.

227
00:08:49,065 --> 00:08:51,540
That brings in big numbers in a hurry.

228
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,470
But the Biden campaign saying that 97%

229
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,210
of all the donations they've received

230
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,530
are from grass-roots donors.

231
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:59,770
Those are in amounts of
less than $200 or less.

232
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:02,480
They also have more than 256,000 donors

233
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,890
who gave a total of 436,000 donations.

234
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:08,880
So obviously Ali, as Biden's
a little bit on the defensive,

235
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,700
having to deal with that
tense debate exchange

236
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,610
with Kamala Harris.

237
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:12,820
A little bit of a reminder of the fact

238
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,070
that he's not going anywhere.

239
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,030
And a reminder from the
Biden campaign, as well,

240
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,230
that his dollars
potentially go a lot longer

241
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,690
than a Mayor Pete's, for instance,

242
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,340
because he's got nearly universal name ID.

243
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,690
He doesn't need to spend
that money on TV ads

244
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,160
establishing who he is to voters.

245
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,350
He can invest that all
in their grass roots

246
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,810
and their infrastructure for
their campaign going forward.

247
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:30,643
- Mike, thank you.

248
00:09:30,643 --> 00:09:32,760
Vaughn Hillyard, Senator Harris is closing

249
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,730
the gap on Biden nationally.

250
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:37,490
You're covering a Kamala
Harris event in Iowa today.

251
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,980
A new USAToday/Suffolk University poll

252
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,330
shows Biden continues to lead with 24%,

253
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:45,445
Harris in second place at 16%.

254
00:09:45,445 --> 00:09:48,460
What's her plan to close the
gap and keep the momentum?

255
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,340
It's an important question,

256
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,890
because Kamala Harris
tends to have moments

257
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:56,080
and she's got to fill up the
space between those moments

258
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,480
to keep that momentum going.

259
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,820
- Yeah, you fill in the
space by campaigning.

260
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,770
She's here in Des Moines.

261
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,640
She'll be appearing over
here in West Des Moines

262
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,620
at this park behind us
here in just about an hour,

263
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,930
before she heads over to the
western part of the state.

264
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:12,300
She'll hit the TV market
in Council Bluffs,

265
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,350
the Omaha area there.

266
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:17,600
On Friday, she'll then hit the
Sioux City television market.

267
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,680
The Kamala Harris campaign
said that they plan

268
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,030
to hit the ground running and not let up.

269
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:24,530
She was over in California
holding fundraisers.

270
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,580
In those first three
days after the debate,

271
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,550
they raised three-and-a
half million dollars,

272
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,427
the campaign said.

273
00:10:29,427 --> 00:10:31,530
The have not released
their quarter totals,

274
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,680
but it should be noted,

275
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,370
she jumped in before anybody
else in this campaign,

276
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:38,730
raising $12,000,000 in that first quarter,

277
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,930
giving her a leg up here compared

278
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:43,050
to Mayor Pete Buttigeig and Joe Biden,

279
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:45,940
who jumped into this race later on.

280
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,930
But for this campaign,

281
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:49,560
this is about painting
contrasts at this point.

282
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,650
Kamala Harris showed that she was willing

283
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,950
to draw contrasts between herself

284
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,000
and other Democratic candidates,

285
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,130
particularly taking on Joe Biden on

286
00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:00,030
the issue of race, busing,
on the Obama Administration's

287
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,960
deportation policy at the debate.

288
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,050
And now the question is going forward,

289
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:07,670
to what extent will she
continue to press the case,

290
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,370
essentially prosecute the case
against her fellow Democrats.

291
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,290
And that starts here
on the campaign trail.

292
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:14,510
She's got two events
today before heading on

293
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,670
across Iowa the next two days.

294
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,160
She'll be in New Orleans then on Saturday

295
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,010
before going to South
Carolina on Sunday and Monday.

296
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:22,843
Ali.

297
00:11:22,843 --> 00:11:23,828
- All right.

298
00:11:23,828 --> 00:11:26,750
And Shaquille, according to
the Quinnipiac University poll,

299
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,700
Sanders is now in fourth place.

300
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,180
You spoke with the campaign's
senior advisor earlier.

301
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:34,421
What is the Sanders' campaign
doing to boost momentum

302
00:11:34,421 --> 00:11:36,023
and what's going on in Iowa?

303
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:40,010
- Well, the say it's not
affecting their strategy

304
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:41,940
and that's why we have Senator Sanders

305
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,950
about to open up this field
office here in Iowa City.

306
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,670
It's just an example of
how the campaign wants

307
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,610
to focus on what they call "ground game,"

308
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:50,100
rather than that recent polling.

309
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,640
And I spoke with Senator
Sanders' chief of staff

310
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,850
about that recent polling.

311
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:56,810
A flood of polls since
our debate last weekend.

312
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,170
As we point out these polls,

313
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:59,890
he's able to point out several more

314
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:03,300
that show Sanders closing the
gap with Vice President Biden,

315
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,710
but also polls that show
him ticking up a little bit.

316
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:08,210
And that's why you have
Senator Sanders, on this trip,

317
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,900
going and participating in
these retail politics events.

318
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,810
So, instead of those big
rallies that we normally see,

319
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,160
he's doing ice cream socials.

320
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,690
He's gonna be marching in
Fourth of July parades.

321
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,970
Really trying to have those
interactions with voters.

322
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,980
And this is a campaign in Iowa
that has scaled up recently.

323
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,710
So right now they have about 43 staffers,

324
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:28,050
but the campaign notes that is lower

325
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,960
than some of the other
campaigns out there.

326
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,590
They highlight their 25,000 volunteers,

327
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,410
who these staffers are
gonna be able to mobilize.

328
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:36,830
Folks who are gonna knock
on doors, make calls.

329
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,440
That's why events like
these are happening.

330
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,610
He's gonna be opening up three
offices throughout the state,

331
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,740
and these are recruiting
events, essentially.

332
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,690
Hoping that they can pull in volunteers.

333
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:49,480
Pull in people to support him
come that caucus in February.

334
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,490
- Shaquille Brewster, Mike
Memoli, Vaughn Hillyard,

335
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:52,340
thanks to the three of you,

336
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,570
our road warriors on the campaign trail.

337
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,403
We're learning more this week

338
00:12:55,403 --> 00:12:57,990
about the Trump Administration's
immigration policies,

339
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:00,650
which many critics say
crosses lines of ethics,

340
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:02,590
human rights, and basic decency.

341
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,190
Next, we'll break down the hellish details

342
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,760
from inside the detention facilties

343
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,600
that come straight from
the government itself.

344
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,850
You're watching Velshi
& Ruhle live on MSNBC.

345
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:19,350
- Fact is, every insurance
company hopes you drive safely.

346
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:22,070
But Allstate actually
helps you drive safely.

347
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,640
With Drivewise.

348
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,161
It lets you know when you go too fast

349
00:13:25,161 --> 00:13:26,280
(tires squealing)

350
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,230
and brake too hard.

351
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,090
With feedback to help you drive safer.

352
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:34,153
Giving you the power to
actually lower your cost.

353
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:39,393
Unfortunately, it can't
do anything about that.

354
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,510
Now that you know the truth,

355
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,890
(car honking)

356
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,123
are you in good hands?

357
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,323
- [Announcer] Let's get down to business.

358
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,653
The business of family time.

359
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,623
And down time.

360
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,353
And you time.

361
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,163

time it is all together.

367
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:17,320
- I switched to Miralax
for my constipation.

368
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,230
Stimulant laxatives forcefully stimulate

369
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,490
the nerves in your colon.

370
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,240
Miralax works with the water in your body

371
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,960
to unblock your system naturally.

372
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,590
And it doesn't cause bloating, cramping,

373
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,630
gas, or a sudden urgency.

374
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:30,080
Miralax, look for the pink cap.

375
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,540

love more than slinging.

376

377
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,900
- Explore all the possibilities.

378
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:40,410
- Your first time slinging
is always so special.

379
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,850
- I cried my first time.

382
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,120
- Going to the Shawn
Mendes Verizon Up concert

383
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,270
was like an out-of-body experience.

- [Announcer] Why the Yousafzai
sisters chose Verizon.

385
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,607
- We right in front of him.

386
00:14:53,607 --> 00:14:54,690
- Dead center, front row.

387
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:56,115
Actually Zermina, you
touched Shawn Mendes.

388
00:14:56,115 --> 00:14:57,206
She touched Shawn Mendes.
- Yeah, I touched him.

389
00:14:57,206 --> 00:14:58,640
He, like, held my hand for a while.

390
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,930
And then we got to meet him after,

391
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:00,763
which was like--

392
00:15:00,763 --> 00:15:01,690
- Another surprise.

393
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:02,523
- Yeah.

394
00:15:02,523 --> 00:15:03,356
We love Verizon even more now.

395
00:15:03,356 --> 00:15:04,527
I'll never forget that day, ever.

396
00:15:04,527 --> 00:15:05,360
(laughter)

397
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,810
- [Announcer] The network
more people rely on

398
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:07,643
gives you more.

399
00:15:07,643 --> 00:15:09,300
Like thousands of tickets to concerts,

400
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,000
festivals and private shows.

401
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,100
And big savings on our
best phones when you--

402
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,290
- You're turning onto the street,

403
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,170
when you barely clip a passing car.

404
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:18,340
Minor accident, no big deal, right?

405
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,173
Wrong.

406
00:15:19,173 --> 00:15:21,150
Your insurance company
is gonna raise your rates

407
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:23,730
after the other car got a scratch so small

408
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:26,080
you could have fixed it with a pen.

409
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,790
Maybe you should take that pen

410
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:30,690
and use it to sign up with a
different insurance company.

411
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,730
- [Announcer] For drivers

Liberty Mutual won't raise their rates

413

all eyes will be on the
US Women's National Team.

425
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,460
- [Woman] For a free case review.

426
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,930
- Isn't this a situation of
hate the game not the player?

427
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,140
- This is a power play.

428
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,180
This is a strategic move from her, right?

429
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,450
- Why is this potentially such a big deal?

430
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,620
- We have more breaking news.

431
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,453
why wouldn't we?

432
00:16:25,453 --> 00:16:26,590
It's Tuesday in Washington.

433
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,950
- The wall is the sticking
point, not border security.

434
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:31,210
- Although the promise was
a wall paid for by Mexico.

435
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:33,360
- I cannot wait to keep
talking about 2020.

436
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,140
I gotta tell you, I
think it's fascinating.

437
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,710
- Your entire business is profiting off

438
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:37,930
of other people's information,

439
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,293
then your job is to keep
that information safe.

440
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,850
This week we are getting
a better understanding

441
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,230
of the conditions inside detention centers

442
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,090
run by Customs and Border Protection.

443
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,110
And the descriptions give a stark look

444
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,340
at how many desperate
people fleeing violence

445
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:01,360
and economic uncertainty
at home are treated.

446
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,810
The Department of Homeland Security's

447
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:04,810
Office of the Inspector General touted

448
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:07,800
five border facilities
and two ports of entry

449
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,690
in the Rio Grande Valley
and released blunt findings.

450
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,040
According to the report,

451
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:16,470
about 3,400 detainees were
held longer than 72 hours.

452
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:19,960
That's the CBP guidelines
for maximum holding time.

453
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,430
In fact, 1,500 of them were
held for more than 10 days.

454
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:27,313
And it found 826 children
were held longer than

455
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:28,860
that 72 hour limit.

456
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,670
That represents about 31% of the children

457
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:34,430
who are held in Customs
and Border Patrol custody.

458
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,850
Despite Customs and Border
Control requirements,

459
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:38,810
that reasonable efforts to allow detainees

460
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:41,580
to shower within 72 hours be made,

461
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,690
the report found that
some adults were unable

462
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:47,190
to shower for up to a month.

463
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:49,720
Detainees were given
wet-wipes for personal hygiene

464
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,690
and many only got bologna sandwiches,

465
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:53,660
leading to cases of constipation.

466
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:56,410
Requirements that
children receive hot meals

467
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,280
were also not being met.

468
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,650
It found that detainees were held

469
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:02,460
in overcrowded cells for up to a month.

470
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,870
One senior manager described the situation

471
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,670
as a "ticking time bomb."

472
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:09,180
Democratic lawmakers visited
the detention facilities

473
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,380
this week and many,

474
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,720
including New York congresswoman
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,

475
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,650
took to Twitter and interviews
to report on conditions.

476
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,720
They described being told things like

477
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,730
women were told that they
could drink out of the toilets.

478
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,350
They reported migrants being woken

479
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,750
at odd hours for no reason

480
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,060
and being subjected to
disparaging language.

481
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:30,000
They described it as
psychological warfare.

482
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,660
And a temporary restraining order filed

483
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,460
by a human rights group quoted
several children interviewed

484
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,297
as saying things like,
"we're in a metal cage,"

485
00:18:36,297 --> 00:18:38,337
"it's very cold," "lights
are on all the time,"

486
00:18:38,337 --> 00:18:40,147
"I'm so hungry," "we got sick,"

487
00:18:40,147 --> 00:18:42,430
"I've never been offered a shower."

488
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:45,150
NBC's Gabe Gutierrez
talked to a pediatrician

489
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,310
who treated some of the
children previously held

490
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,830
in CBP detention.

491
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,180
Here's what she had to say.

492
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:53,390
- Children should not be in a place

493
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:55,810
where they don't have access
to their basic human needs.

494
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:58,430
Where they don't have
access to, if they are sick,

495
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,285
a medical provider.

496
00:19:00,285 --> 00:19:03,560
It is detrimental, not
only to their acute state,

497
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,620
to what's happening right now,

498
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,420
but to their future development
and their mental health.

499
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:10,320
- All right, joining me
now MSNBC correspondent

500
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,190
Jacob Soboroff.

501
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:13,590
Jacob, the acting Secretary
of Homeland Security

502
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,810
is calling for an investigation.

503
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:18,760
However, it's not into the
conditions that I just laid out,

504
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,460
that were in the Office of the
Inspector General's report,

505
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,130
it was something else.

506
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:24,963
- Yeah, that's right.

507
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:28,210
He's calling on the Office of
Professional Responsibility,

508
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,350
Ali, within DHS to investigate

509
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,550
what they normally investigate,

510
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,030
which is misconduct,

511
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:36,840
a lack of standards inside
the department being upheld.

512
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,300
And the results of that
investigation, as you said,

513
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,760
will be specifically about
these Facebook messages

514
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,270
that have been uncovered by Propublica

515
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:45,770
and what really was
extraordinarily shocking

516
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:49,200
and dehumanizing language
that was being used

517
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,790
by the folks that were inside this group.

518
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,790
And it's a group of, a
large amount of people.

519
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,800
I think 9,500 people.

520
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,210
But ultimately, it might
come down to the acts

521
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:01,800
and the language used by
these specific agents,

522
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:06,430
if indeed they were acting,
current border patrol agents

523
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:08,050
at the time they used those messages.

524
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:08,883
- All right.

525
00:20:08,883 --> 00:20:11,240
The ACLU, Jacob, has
just won a legal battle

526
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,620
over asylum seekers.

527
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,710
Can you tell us more about that

528
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,650
and what it means for
the people at the border

529
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,510
and in these detention facilities?

530
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,450
- Yeah, It's extraordinarily
important, as a matter of fact,

531
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:23,410
because Attorney General Barr
wanted to hold asylum seekers

532
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:27,500
in custody without any ability
to bond themselves out.

533
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,440
To get out by paying a bail or a bond.

534
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,410
And, frankly, just hold them in detention

535
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,490
for the pendancy of their asylum hearings

536
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:36,993
and their immigration court hearings.

537
00:20:36,993 --> 00:20:40,270
It's another attempt to deter
migration to this country

538
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:42,640
by saying if you come here,
try to declare asylum,

539
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,500
we're gonna lock you up, basically.

540
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,530
But at the end of the day,
we're talking about asylum,

541
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:47,910
we're not talking about criminals.

542
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:50,780
And the judge seems to have sided,

543
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,270
the judge clearly sided
against Attorney General Barr

544
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,570
here in that case,

545
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:58,250
and the administration will
not be able to lock people up

546
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,380
who are here only because
they want to seek asylum.

547
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,213
- All right.

548
00:21:02,213 --> 00:21:04,020
The Washington Post, Jacob,
is reporting about a child

549
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,960
who died in May after spending time

550
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,120
in Customs and Border Patrol custody.

551
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,426
What do we know about
this from the autopsy?

552
00:21:10,426 --> 00:21:12,820
- Again, it's a familiar refrain, Ali.

553
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,910
Ultimately this child
died of, the autopsy says,

554
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:18,670
several diseases, parasites, influenza,

555
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:21,220
and what the lawyer for
the family is alleging,

556
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,463
now that this autopsy is out,

557
00:21:22,463 --> 00:21:25,930
is that this child should
have gotten treatment

558
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:29,780
far before he and his mother
were sent to a hospital

559
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:32,230
once they were detained by
Customs and Border Protection.

560
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:35,700
I want to remind everybody
that CBP was touting,

561
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,450
for quite some time,
that no child had died

562
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:39,160
in their custody for 10 years.

563
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,780
And since the Trump Administration began,

564
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:44,970
six children have died in CBP custody

565
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,060
over that period of time.

566
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,830
This is just more details
about one of those cases,

567
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,800
specifically, and it
raises a lot of red flags

568
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,010
about why these children aren't
getting treatment sooner.

569
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:56,400
We now see all of these
overcrowding conditions.

570
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,450
All the conditions that a child like this

571
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,680
would have been held in.

572
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,030
But again, the question remains:

573
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:03,360
Why aren't they getting help sooner?

574
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,193
- All right.

575
00:22:04,193 --> 00:22:06,783
The Daily Beast is reporting
that ICE agents told,

576
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:10,220
said "Happy Hunting" as they prepared for

577
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:13,370
a nationwide immigration
raid coming after July 4th.

578
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:14,540
Tell me about that.

579
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,827
- Well, I wanna be clear about
this report in particular.

580
00:22:16,827 --> 00:22:20,010
"Happy hunting" referred
to immigration raids

581
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:23,320
that were supposed to happen back in 2017,

582
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,650
and this is not an isolated use

583
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:28,700
of this dehumanizing
phrase, happy hunting.

584
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,590
Adiel Kaplan, a colleague
of ours at NBC News,

585
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:34,240
has also reported that
the phrase happy hunting

586
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,900
was also used by Border Patrol agents

587
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,190
who were going to be
doing random spot checks

588
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,080
on Greyhound buses and other
modes of transportation

589
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,660
in the northeast of the United States

590
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,990
within what's called that 100-mile zone

591
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,111
that the Border Patrol
is allowed to do searches

592
00:22:47,111 --> 00:22:49,480
on public transportation.

593
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,951
The idea that we've seen
these Facebook reports now

594
00:22:52,951 --> 00:22:55,610
of dehumanizing language
towards members of Congress

595
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:58,440
and towards immigrants in the
custody of the US Government.

596
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,900
That ICE agents are saying "happy hunting"

597
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,280
when it comes to tracking
down and conducting

598
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,150
what are called interior
removals inside this country.

599
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:09,130
And Border Patrol agents have
said the exact same thing

600
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:12,580
about migrants that are
potentially on buses

601
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:15,120
in the northeast of the United
States, far from the border,

602
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,140
certainly suggest that there is a culture

603
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,447
of using this type of language within CBP

604
00:23:20,447 --> 00:23:22,810
and we have not yet
seen a response from CBP

605
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:25,790
about this most recent report
from The Daily Beast, Ali.

606
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,470
- All right, Jacob, thank you
for your reporting, as always.

607
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,250
Jacob Soboroff for us in Los Angeles.

608
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,090
Coming up next, the tanks have arrived!

609
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:33,530
President Trump is being
accused of militarizing

610
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:36,590
and politicizing the national
July 4th celebration.

611
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,820
We'll look at his plans and
the cost for the festivities.

612
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,203
You're watching Velshi
& Ruhle live on MSNBC.

613
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:50,813
- In America every car is a
declaration of independence.

614
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:54,720
And to celebrate our nation's birthday,

615
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,180
we'll do it at Daytona.

616
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,053
In a 200-mile-an-hour blur
of red, white and blue.

617
00:24:02,402 --> 00:24:05,485
(driving rock music)

618
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,820
- [Announcer] Always there in crunch time.

619
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,600
- [Narrator] Paul, you're
the greatest neighbor.

620
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,700
You help us find the best
home-improvement pros,

621
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,160
get quotes and research
prices for our home projects.

622
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,210
- That.

623
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:27,540
That's not me.

624
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,440
That's HomeAdvisor.

625
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,310
- [Narrator] You can't expect
your neighbors to do it all,

626
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,590
so just ask HomeAdvisor.

627
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,230
- [Announcer] July 4th
lands on a Thursday.

628
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,330
- I got it.

629
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:37,700
- [Announcer] So bookers are
booking a one, two, three,

630
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,330
that's a four-day weekend!

631
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:40,163
- Awesome.

632
00:24:40,163 --> 00:24:41,960

635

- [Woman] If you have
moderate to severe psoriasis,

636
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:51,790
little things can be a big deal.

637
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,520
That's why there's Otezla.

638
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,250
Otezla is not a cream.

639
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:58,120
It's a pill that treats
plaque psoriasis differently.

640
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:02,040
With Otezla, 75% clearer
skin is achievable.

641
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,010
Don't use if you're allergic to Otezla.

642
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:06,910
It may cause severe
diarrhea, nausea or vomiting.

643
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:10,080
Otezla is associated with an
increased risk of depression.

644
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,560
Tell your doctor if you have a history

645
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,070
of depression or suicidal thoughts,

646
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,670
or if these feelings develop.

647
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:17,010
Some people taking Otezla
reported weight loss.

648
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,470
Your doctor should monitor your weight

649
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,730
and may stop treatment.

650
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:21,290
Upper respiratory tract infection

651
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:22,700
and headache may occur.

652
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,330
Tell your doctor about your medicine

653
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:26,160
and if you're pregnant or planning to be.

654
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,460
Ready to threat differently with a pill?

655
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,497
Otezla, show more of you.

656
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:34,170
- I feel like I've been
on a diet my entire life.

657
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:38,300
- I even cut out bread
and pasta for a day.

658
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,750
- And then I tried Noom.

659
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,583
- It's different.

660
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:43,660
It's more of something that
I can actually live with.

661
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,895
I wouldn't even call it a diet.

662
00:25:44,895 --> 00:25:46,490
- I feel like anyone can use Noom.

663
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:47,810
- It was super easy.

664
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:48,643
- Super easy.

665
00:25:48,643 --> 00:25:50,300
- It's an easy-to-stick-to program

666
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,070
that actually changed my habits.

667
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,650
It changed the way I look at food.

668
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:56,400
- They say it's based on a
cognitive behavioral approach.

669
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,650
I just say it works.

670
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:00,773
- [Woman] Visit noom.com and
lose the weight for good.

671
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:05,040
- Did you know even the
cleanest-looking cars

672
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,010
can smell musty.

673
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:08,740
That's because odors trapped
in your car's soft surfaces

674
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,980
get released and are then
circulated by your AC system.

675
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,610
To stop the cycle of odors,

676
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:15,390
try Febreze CAR Vent Clips.

677
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:17,890
Febreze stops the circulation of musty air

678
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:20,730
by trapping and eliminating
lingering odor molecules

679
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:23,000
for up to 30 days of fresh clean air.

680
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,750
Plus, they come in a range of scents,

681
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,190
including Extra Light.

682
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:28,190
Stop the cycle of odors in your car

683
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,540
with Febreze CAR Vent.

684
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,520
- This is a legal alert for users

685
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,170
of Roundup Weed Killer.

686
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:36,500
In July 2018 a judge determined
that all federal lawsuits

687
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,440
could move forward against Monsanto,

688
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,310
the maker of Roundup Weed Killer,

689
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:42,700
over concerns that those
exposed are at risk

690
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,710
for developing Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

691
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:46,900
And in three landmark verdicts,

692
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:50,460
the most recent in May
of 2019 for $2 billion,

693
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,020
one in March 2019 for 80 million

694
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:56,740
and another in August
2018 for 289 million,

695
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,070
it was concluded that
Roundup was responsible

696
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:01,410
for the plaintiffs Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

697
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,440
Roundup Weed Killer is
the most commonly used

698
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,250
weed killer in American agriculture,

699
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:08,910
with an estimated 85 to 90
million pounds used each year.

700
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:11,320
If you or someone you
love has been diagnosed

701
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,010
with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
after being exposed

702
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:16,380
to Roundup, or a glyphosate herbicide,

703
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,280
you may be entitled to compensation.

704
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,720
How do you fight for the
compensation you deserve?

705
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,540
You choose the right legal team,

710
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:37,970
- Welcome back to Velshi & Ruhle.

711
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:41,310
Tomorrow we celebrate the
United States 243rd birthday

712
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,750
and President Trump is preparing

713
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:45,040
for his Salute to America event.

714
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,160
It's a very different kind of celebration

715
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,830
than what Washington DC is used to

716
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:51,700
as tanks and armored
personnel carriers arrived

717
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:54,740
in the Capital on flatbed
trucks over the past few days.

718
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:58,010
The president is touting the
present of M4 Sherman tanks,

719
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,270
which are World War II-era vehicles

720
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,830
he describes as brand new,

721
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:04,700
along with the more
modern M1 Abrams tanks.

722
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,660
APCs, represented by the
Bradley Fighting vehicle,

723
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,110
will also flank the ceremony.

724
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,090
The president's event is gonna take place

725
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:13,780
at the Lincoln Memorial,
where a source tells NBC News

726
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,320
he'll give remarks described

727
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:20,150
as uplifting and patriotic,
but not political.

728
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:22,790
Joining me now, NBC Pentagon
correspondent Courtney Kube.

729
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:25,010
Courtney, let's talk about the logistics

730
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:26,880
of the military display.

731
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,210
This isn't typical.

732
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:29,803
What's been the reaction from the Petagon?

733
00:28:29,803 --> 00:28:31,430
It's been very complicated to get some

734
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:33,480
of these big tanks into DC.

735
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,580
- Yeah, absolutely.

736
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,510
Well, you have to remember,

737
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,343
that when you have something like

738
00:28:36,343 --> 00:28:39,420
an Abrams tank that weighs tons and tons,

739
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,670
you can't just can't drive
it down a normal street.

740
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:44,280
It's actually not uncommon
for large military vehicles

741
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,139
to be moved via rail.

742
00:28:46,139 --> 00:28:47,450
You know, if you go to
some of these bases,

743
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:49,230
we were down in Camp
Lejeune a couple months ago,

744
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,890
they have railway tracks where

745
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:52,650
they move some of their larger vehicles.

746
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:53,483
So that's what they did here.

747
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:55,810
They brought these Abrams tanks up

748
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:58,430
from Fort Stewart in Georgia, via rail,

749
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:59,940
and then they stuck on flatbeds

750
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,220
and drove them into the city,

751
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,930
because they were so
concerned about the weight,

752
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:05,460
but also the treads.

753
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,400
You know, these are tracked vehicles

754
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,460
and the treads can tear up the street.

755
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,500
You know, there's been a lot of question

756
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,030
about how is the Pentagon?

757
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:14,880
How are military leaders reacting to this?

758
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,010
There's been widespread
concern from military leaders

759
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:19,650
and officials who we've spoken to

760
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:20,700
over the past several months.

761
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,670
Since the idea of this parade even came up

762
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,960
and making it dedicated to the military

763
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,230
and having a large military involvement.

764
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:28,260
But at the end of the day,

765
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:31,850
the Pentagon lawyers reviewed
the plan and they approved it,

766
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:33,440
and they said this is an appropriate thing

767
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,840
for the US military to participate in

768
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,150
and to be apart of Ali.

769
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,190
- Is there any, I just
want to be clear on this,

770
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:41,880
if the military had a problem with it,

771
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,230
would they be compelled to send people?

772
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,270
- Uh, no.

773
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,740
I mean, if they had a problem with it

774
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:50,300
and it was considered to
be an illegal activity,

775
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,680
they of course would
not be involved in it.

776
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,010
If the attorneys found out
that there was some way

777
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:57,960
be a conflict of interest for them.

778
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,500
But you know as I said, it's not.

779
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,180
And so the military is participating.

780
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,660
There's also been some questions sbout

781
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:06,010
why is it that some of
the more senior members

782
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,560
of the Joint Chiefs aren't attending?

783
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,510
Like Army Chief of Staff Mark Milley.

784
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,480
The Commandant of the Marine
Corps, General Neller.

785
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,070
Well, we've been told by
numerous military officials,

786
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,490
of course we've been asking all week

787
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:17,730
who's gonna be attending?

788
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:18,950
And the reality is,

789
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:22,459
this came up kind of at the
last minute, this parade,

790
00:30:22,459 --> 00:30:24,950
and a lot of these
people already had plans.

791
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:27,000
Some of them plan to be out of town.

792
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,700
Some of them plan to be on leave.

793
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,190
You know, Fourth of July isn't

794
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:32,380
a traditional military holiday,

795
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,970
in that the military
participate in a lot of events,

796
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:37,170
so a lot of these guys
planned to take time off, Ali.

797
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,003
- Yeah.

798
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:39,190
Courtney, thank you for
your reporting on this.

799
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:40,023
We'll keep a close eye on it.

800
00:30:40,023 --> 00:30:41,880
Courtney Kube joining
us from the Pentagon.

801
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,713
Joining us now,

802
00:30:42,713 --> 00:30:44,830
California Democratic
Congressman Gil Cisneros.

803
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,110
He's a member of the Armed Services

804
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,310
and Veterans' Affairs Committee.

805
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,790
He is a veteran himself.

806
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:49,623
Congressman, good to see you.

807
00:30:49,623 --> 00:30:51,430
Thank you for joining us.

808
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,840
- Well, thank you for having me.

809
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,500
- We have been discussing,
as you've heard,

810
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,450
concern that the president's
Fourth of July celebration

811
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:59,980
is heavy on military
pageantry and could feel

812
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:02,630
more like a taxpayer-funded
campaign rally.

813
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:03,960
What's your take on this?

814
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,540
I mean, do you have a view about
the military participation?

815
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,880
There is always a parade.

816
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,970
This one just seems to have

817
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:10,530
a bit more of a military component,

818
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:13,150
and a bit more of a political component.

819
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:15,280
- Well, the Fourth of July should be about

820
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,483
celebrating our independence,
celebrating democracy.

821
00:31:19,609 --> 00:31:21,960
You know, for celebrating our military,

822
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,820
we have Veterans' Day.

823
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,660
I think what he's doing
right now is turning

824
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,630
this event into a spectacle.

825
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:30,649
That's not that something
that we need and,

826
00:31:30,649 --> 00:31:33,000
like your last guest just said,

827
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,660
a lot of the generals
aren't gonna be there

828
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,430
because they already made plans.

829
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,370
Unfortunately for these service members,

830
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:39,203
they're gonna have to
be there with the tanks.

831
00:31:39,203 --> 00:31:40,890
They're gonna have to be there

832
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:43,150
with this aircraft for the flyovers.

833
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:46,500
The plans that they had
made had to be canceled

834
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,850
and now they're gonna have to
spend it here on the parade

835
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:51,210
instead of spending it with
their families and friends.

836
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:53,360
- All right, we're hearing
that the DNC didn't get

837
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,270
any tickets to the president's event.

838
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:57,490
We heard Kellyanne Conway
saying it's a public event.

839
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:58,890
What do you know about this?

840
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:02,760
- Well, I know I wasn't
offered any tickets,

841
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,520
to offer anything to my constituents.

842
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,650
You know, this is what
this president is doing.

843
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:08,410
He's turning it into, basically,

844
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:11,120
a campaign rally for himself.

845
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,940
This is not what the Fourth of
July is supposed to be about.

846
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,280
This is supposed to be
a non-partisan event.

847
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:19,410
It's supposed to be celebrating
the birth of our nation,

848
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:21,250
the birth of our democracy.

849
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:23,370
And, really, he's turning into an event

850
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:24,770
completely for himself.

851
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:26,610
Somewhere that he can highlight himself.

852
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:27,940
In which I'm sure he will use.

853
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,310
We'll see some of these highlights

854
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:31,290
in campaign footage later on.

855
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:32,620
- Let's talk about immigration.

856
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,890
You are in the Congressional
Hispanic Caucus.

857
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:36,680
A group that has been very, very upset

858
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,290
about the way things are going
in these detention centers,

859
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,720
and at the border generally.

860
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,070
What's your sense of
Congress' plan to take action?

861
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,900
We saw this Inspector General's report

862
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,720
from the Department of Homeland Security.

863
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,770
Which is scathing and
flies right in the face

864
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:53,860
of what DHS officials and
leaders of these very departments

865
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,290
and the administration has been saying

866
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,540
about these detention centers.

867
00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:00,720
The DHS report is right in
line what our reporters,

868
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,910
and what you members of
Congress have been reporting

869
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:04,320
about these centers,

870
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,450
and in complete contrast to what

871
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:08,560
the administration is saying.

872
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,650
- Well, the DHS report is just confirming

873
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:12,240
what we've been hearing all along.

874
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,720
That the situation down there

875
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,580
in these facilities is atrocious.

876
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,760
You know, we're treating these individuals

877
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,130
who are coming here to this country

878
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:21,370
just trying to seek a better life

879
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:23,140
for themselves, for their families.

880
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,670
We're treating them worse than we treat

881
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,270
prisoners in our penitentiaries.

882
00:33:27,207 --> 00:33:29,780
It's something that needs to change

883
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:34,120
and that why I couldn't
support the Appropriations,

884
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:38,120
the Border Appropriation Supplemental Bill

885
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,270
that passed through the House,

886
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,610
passed through the Senate last week

887
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:42,836
that the president's gonna sign.

888
00:33:42,836 --> 00:33:46,520
It wasn't gonna change any
of the policies were going.

889
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,737
It's gonna be business as usual for CBP.

890
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:53,220
Business as usual for
Homeland Security, for ICE.

891
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:56,040
And we need real action
that's gonna really change

892
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,198
the conditions that's going
on in these facilities.

893
00:33:57,198 --> 00:33:58,520
- But 4.3 billion dollars,

894
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,057
that can't be business as usual, right?

895
00:34:00,057 --> 00:34:02,093
That can't possibly be.

896
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,177
- Well, I think a lot of it is gonna go.

897
00:34:05,177 --> 00:34:06,948
We know what they were doing.

898
00:34:06,948 --> 00:34:08,870
There's nothing in that bill

899
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:11,310
that's gonna change what was going on.

900
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:13,120
There's nothing that's
gonna change the standards.

901
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,940
There's nothing that's
gonna make it mandatory

902
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,640
that they see a physician.

903
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,010
I mean, we're hearing about these children

904
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:21,000
are dying because nobody's looked at them.

905
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,110
They have the flu.

906
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:24,560
They have things that
could be treated simply,

907
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,000
that we have the medication,
the medicine to do,

908
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,910
and they're not getting that treatment,

909
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:30,400
and there's nothing that was in this bill

910
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,490
that's gonna change that policy at all.

911
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:33,500
- Okay, I understand what you're saying.

912
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,710
It doesn't change policy.

913
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:37,440
But it does fund things that we understand

914
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,273
had problems with funding.

915
00:34:38,273 --> 00:34:41,360
I guess I worry about what you think of

916
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,360
as a very good humanitarian bill,

917
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,860
that may not be achievable

918
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:49,160
and voting against one
that was achievable.

919
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,640
- Well, this is the thing that we need

920
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,350
to keep pushing for, right, in the House.

921
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:54,260
And it's something that
I'm gonna be vocal about,

922
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,070
is we need to kind of keep pushing for

923
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:58,930
the humanitarian treatment
of these individuals

924
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,050
that are in these facilities.

925
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:02,200
We need to make sure
they can see a physician.

926
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,580
We need to make sure that
they're gonna get hot meals.

927
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,853
That it's not a bologna sandwich.

928
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:10,700
And again, it's good that
they're gonna be able

929
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,100
to get more bologna sandwiches,

930
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,250
but that's not what they need.

931
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,810
We need something, we need policy,

932
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:19,850
we need to change a bill that's
gonna actually change policy

933
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:21,920
to make sure that these
children see a doctor.

934
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,830
To make sure that the families
are getting a hot meal.

935
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:26,380
That they're gonna have a toothbrush.

936
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,570
That they're gonna be able
to get a shower there.

937
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:30,030
- Congressman, thanks for
the time you've taken.

938
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:30,863
I appreciate it.

941
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:35,783
All right.

942
00:35:35,783 --> 00:35:37,427
President Trump has long
promised to slash drug prices

943
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:38,680
and has said they're coming down.

944
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,870
For facts sake, thousands
of drug prices have gone up

945
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:43,090
during his administration.

946
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:44,480
We're gonna look at which common drugs

947
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,690
have seen the biggest spike.

What would you like the power to do?

1027
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:26,550
- President Trump has
been promising to lower

1028
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:27,760
prescription drug prices,

1029
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,650
but it appears that some
are actually spiking.

1030
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:33,220
For facts sake, the
government's own data shows

1031
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:37,940
prices increased by 1.2% in May compared

1032
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,680
to the same month last year.

1033
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,130
New analysis by RX Savings Solutions,

1034
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,870
it's a consultant for
employers and for health plans,

1035
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:48,290
shows that the price of
more than 3,400 drugs

1036
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:51,210
increased on an average of 17% compared

1037
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:52,370
to the same time last year.

1038
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:53,370
17%!

1039
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:55,370
What else in your life is up 17%?

1040
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:58,300
The average hike was about 10.5%,

1041
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:01,200
or about five times the rate of inflation,

1042
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,040
or about five times the rate by which

1043
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,450
your paycheck may have gone
up over the same period.

1044
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:10,450
At least 41 drugs increased
by more than 100%.

1045
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,210
It includes one version of fluoxetine,

1046
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:18,990
which is the generic
antidepressant Prozac, up 879%!

1047
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:20,542
This is a generic.

1048
00:40:20,542 --> 00:40:24,130
Mometasone, which is a
topical steroid cream,

1049
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:27,040
increased by 381%,

1050
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,280
Promethazine/Codeine, a pain
reliever and cough medication,

1051
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,640
went up 326%.

1052
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,440
In fact, just this past Monday,

1053
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:38,580
20 companies raised the
list prices of more than

1054
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:43,150
104 prescription drugs an average of 13%.

1055
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:45,470
One of them is a drug called isolyte.

1056
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:47,440
It's a saline solution that's been used

1057
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,080
to hydrate patients in
hospitals for years,

1058
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:54,420
essentially salt water, it was up 100%.

1059
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:57,332
With me now NBC Medical
Corespondent Dr. John Torres

1060
00:40:57,332 --> 00:40:58,980
to explain some of this stuff.

1061
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,380
John, good to see you.

1062
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,213
- Good to see you as well.

1063
00:41:01,213 --> 00:41:03,100
- I dwell in economics,
you dwell in medicine.

1064
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,760
I can never figure out
how to make sense of drugs

1065
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,320
and the costs and the increases.

1066
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,240
- And I don't think you're alone,

1067
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,730
and you're very well informed.

1068
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:12,080
Yet, you go to the
pharmacy, you get your drug,

1069
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,480
you try to pay for it and you find out,

1070
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,890
the same drug you used a year ago,

1071
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:16,240
all of a sudden has doubled in price,

1072
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,450
and you don't really know why.

1073
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:19,010
And I think the word
you're gonna hear a lot

1074
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,280
coming up in the next few months

1075
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,300
and next few years is transparency.

1076
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,230
And I think that's the
biggest problem we have here

1077
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:26,370
is those drug prices aren't transparent

1078
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:27,640
and nobody really has any idea

1079
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,250
how those prices are even set.

1080
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:31,230
How the insurance companies
decide what to charge.

1081
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:33,000
And then we have these things called PBMs.

1082
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,760
They're kind of the middleman.

1083
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,790
- Pharmacy Benefit Managers.

1084
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:36,623
- Exactly.

1085
00:41:36,623 --> 00:41:37,660
They take their cut as well,

1086
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,670
and so there's a lot of hands in that pie

1087
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:40,610
trying to find out how to get money,

1088
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:41,443
and I think that's part of the issue.

1089
00:41:41,443 --> 00:41:43,490
- The PBMs are negotiating
with drug makers.

1090
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:45,150
They're negotiating with your health plan,

1091
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:47,450
your insurance company and the pharmacies,

1092
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:48,970
and that's sort of the black box.

1093
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:50,161
We don't know what happens in there.

1094
00:41:50,161 --> 00:41:51,350
- Exactly, and it is a black box,

1095
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:53,050
because magic goes on in there

1096
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:54,857
and all of a sudden a drug price pops out.

1097
00:41:54,857 --> 00:41:56,930
And that drug price can
change from month to month

1098
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:57,937
and people see that all the time.

1099
00:41:57,937 --> 00:41:59,620
- And different for you and me

1100
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,542
and someone paying cash
and someone with a coupon.

1101
00:42:01,542 --> 00:42:02,375
- It completely depends on your insurance

1102
00:42:02,375 --> 00:42:03,650
or whether you have insurance or not.

1103
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:04,697
What it is.

1104
00:42:04,697 --> 00:42:06,360
You can even have the same insurance,

1105
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,010
but have different
contracts in that insurance

1106
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:09,760
and getting charged
different amounts of money.

1107
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,800
You just don't know.

1108
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,513
- As a journalist in 2019,

1109
00:42:12,513 --> 00:42:16,910
we are able to and have to
be critical of the president

1110
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:18,800
and the administration a lot.

1111
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,770
But there have been a lot of people

1112
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:23,320
who understand this world
who say that President Trump

1113
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,480
has been trying to make progress on this.

1114
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,020
It felt important to him to do so

1115
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,740
and he is frustrated by his

1116
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:31,520
Health and Human Services
secretary, Alex Azar,

1117
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,260
who, by the way, is a
former drug executive,

1118
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,480
for not getting more done.

1119
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,930
What do we know about what's going on?

1120
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:38,660
What efforts there are to
bring these prices down

1121
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,240
when what we're seeing
is the prices go up?

1122
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,700
- So, they're trying to
bring these prices down,

1123
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,860
but they're trying to do it piecemeal.

1124
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,727
So, they go into the pharmacy
companies and saying,

1125
00:42:44,727 --> 00:42:46,780
"Hey, can you help lower
your prices a little bit?"

1126
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:48,400
They're going to the PBMs and saying,

1127
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,790
maybe we should make some regulations

1128
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:51,490
where they're not able to get that piece

1129
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:52,710
of the pie that they wanna get,

1130
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:53,593
and that's gonna lower prices.

1131
00:42:53,593 --> 00:42:55,640
They're going to pharmacies and saying,

1132
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,870
don't distribute them
for such a big price.

1133
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:59,920
They problem is, there's
so many different entities

1134
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:00,753
involved with this.

1135
00:43:00,753 --> 00:43:02,100
Last month, I was in Germany looking

1136
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,370
at their healthcare system

1137
00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:04,620
and they have a system set up

1138
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,130
where it's all very transparent.

1139
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:09,100
Everybody comes together at
the beginning to decide one,

1140
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,470
if it's a drug worth actually
selling in the country,

1141
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:13,641
using does it help anything, and two,

1142
00:43:13,641 --> 00:43:15,820
what's the price we're
gonna set on this drug.

1143
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:18,100
Everybody there has a
co-pay of 10 euros a month,

1144
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,970
so no matter what drug you
get it's 10 euros a month.

1145
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:21,440
And it's just the way
their system is set up.

1146
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,843
And that's only been for
the last decade or so.

1147
00:43:22,843 --> 00:43:23,910
It's a new system.

1148
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:25,633
- Well, we need something in this country.

1149
00:43:25,633 --> 00:43:27,790
This is a great drug system for people

1150
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:28,670
who make money off of it,

1151
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:30,010
but if you actually have to pay for drugs

1152
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:31,810
in this country it's very frustrating.

1153
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:32,643
Wanna hear what you think.

1154
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:34,190
John, thanks very much for being with us.

1155
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:36,680
And please send me an e-mail or tweet me

1156
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,450
your thoughts on what
you think can be done

1157
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:40,870
about drug prices in this country.

1158
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:42,030
All right, another piece of news for you.

1159
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:44,810
The legendary automobile
visionary, Lee Iacoca,

1160
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:46,920
passed away Tuesday at his California home

1161
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,880
of complications with Parkinson's.

1162
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,180
Now, many of you will
remember Lee Iacocca.

1163
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,870
He entered the automobile industry as

1164
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:55,040
an engineering trainee for Ford Motors

1165
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,010
when he was 22-years old.

1166
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:58,510
Through a series of successes,

1167
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:01,200
including with the
invention of the Mustang,

1168
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:05,610
Iacocca became the president
of Ford at just 46-years old.

1169
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:08,820
Now because of tensions between
Iacocca and Henry Ford II,

1170
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:12,610
he left for a position with
Chrysler just eight years later

1171
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:15,120
and that is a move that saved the company.

1172
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:18,630
Chrysler was debt-ridden and
losing millions of dollars.

1173
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:21,630
Iacocca saved the company from bankruptcy

1174
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:24,500
by introducing the
fuel-efficient K-car line,

1175
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,270
allowing the company to
make several different

1176
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:29,160
models of cars on one chassis at a time.

1177
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,770
He introduced the Chrysler Minivan,

1178
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:32,870
which led the auto industry for years.

1179
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:35,710
Bringing Chrysler back into competition.

1180
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:38,590
Safe to say, Lee Iacocca
remade the automobile industry

1181
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:40,960
before retiring in 1992.

1182
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,360
He made his name known by
appearing in commercials.

1183
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,890
He was listed as one of the
world's most respected men

1184
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:47,860
in a mid-1980s Gallup poll,

1185
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:52,370
only behind President Ronald
Reagan and Pope John Paul II.

1186
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:54,030
His name even came up as a potential

1187
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:57,010
presidential contender in 1988.

1188
00:44:57,010 --> 00:44:59,460
Lee Iacocca was 94-year old.

1189
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:00,460
We'll be right back.

I'm thinking about a scuba diving trip.

1198
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:16,355
- [Woman on Phone] Ooo.

1199

- (gasps) Or not!

1200

until your check engine light comes on

1212

or worse yet, your car needs repair.

1213
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:44,560
That could mean a big
surprise auto repair bill.

1214

expensive than ever.

have a car and it's broken

1239
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:45,490
and you can't pay for it to get it fixed.

1240
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:47,150
- [Announcer] Here's how CarShield works.

1241
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:48,750

you take it to your favorite

1248

Americans watch NBC News

1289
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:50,453
than any other news
organization in the world.

1290
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:54,720
- Welcome back to Velshi & Ruhle.

1291
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,030
A new NBC exclusive report suggests

1292
00:48:57,030 --> 00:48:58,710
the tension between Silicon Valley

1293
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:00,720
and Capital Hill is intensifying.

1294
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,690
The report details how
tech advocacy groups

1295
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:06,030
are now pushing back on legislation

1296
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:08,220
aimed at regulating major tech giants,

1297
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:09,410
which was introduced by

1298
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:12,080
a Republican senator,
Josh Hawley, last month.

1299
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:15,500
AdNow, tech-focused
non-profits in DC are fearing

1300
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:17,820
a quote partisan blood match between

1301
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:19,810
big companies and top regulators.

1302
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:21,405
Joining me now, NBC political reporter,

1303
00:49:21,405 --> 00:49:23,640
the one who wrote the story, Allan Smith.

1304
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:24,620
Allan, what's this about?

1305
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:26,280
Why is Hawley, a conservative,

1306
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,930
the guy putting forward legislation

1307
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:31,410
to regulate tech companies
and what's the larger concern?

1308
00:49:31,410 --> 00:49:32,870
- So first off, Senator Hawley,

1309
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:34,610
a first-term senator from Missouri.

1310
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:36,940
He's come in and he's
wanting to be the Republican

1311
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:38,250
who's really at the forefront

1312
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:40,390
of some of these tech
regulations battles, right?

1313
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:42,700
He's splitting with Republican orthodoxy

1314
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:43,900
and he wants to have a much more

1315
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:45,690
activist government in this regard.

1316
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:48,600
Now this bill that he's
proposed is super controversial,

1317
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,640
and there's a lot of pushback from groups

1318
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,080
that aren't directly aligned
with Google and Facebook.

1319
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:55,070
What the bill would do simply is remove

1320
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:58,430
some of the protections that
major tech companies enjoy

1321
00:49:58,430 --> 00:50:00,440
under what's known as Section 230 of

1322
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,150
the Communications Decency Act.

1323
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:03,210
- [Ali] Which was written in the 90s.

1324
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:04,043
- Yes.

1325
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:04,876
- And a lot of people feel that it's

1326
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:06,950
a little antiquated, a little out of date.

1327
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:07,800
- A little bit.

1328
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:12,800
So, this law provides
freedom from liability

1329
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:14,370
for these tech companies for stuff

1330
00:50:14,370 --> 00:50:16,131
that third-party users
post on their platform.

1331
00:50:16,131 --> 00:50:17,451
- [Ali] Backpage would be
the best example, right?

1332
00:50:17,451 --> 00:50:18,284
- Yes.

1333
00:50:18,284 --> 00:50:19,117
- Backpage made the argument that we're

1334
00:50:19,117 --> 00:50:21,100
just a site that people put stuff on.

1335
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:23,060
You can't hold us liable for the content.

1336
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:23,893
- Absolutely.

1337
00:50:23,893 --> 00:50:26,060
So, what Hawley's bill does
is it changes that immunity,

1338
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:28,470
so that these companies
would have to apply for it

1339
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:32,550
every two years from the
FTC, and the FTC would vote.

1340
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:33,610
You would need a super majority,

1341
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:35,300
four out of five commissioners would vote

1342
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:39,930
if the company's practices
are quote politically neutral.

1343
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:42,460
So Hawley's side says,
look with a super majority

1344
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:44,600
of the FTC commissioners
having to get on board,

1345
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,380
you would have a bi-partisan response.

1346
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:48,070
But we both know, very well,

1347
00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:50,150
that Republicans and
Democrats don't really agree

1348
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:52,290
on a definition of
politically neutral right now.

1349
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:54,110
And some of these companies
could just get stuck

1350
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:56,450
in this purgatory where
they're not receiving immunity,

1351
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:58,950
and then you could have a
situation where, you know,

1352
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:00,540
if every single piece of content

1353
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:01,990
these companies could be liable for,

1354
00:51:01,990 --> 00:51:03,900
they'll end up with much
wider-spread censorship.

1355
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:06,010
They're gonna have to review
every piece of content

1356
00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:06,990
that goes up on their website.

1357
00:51:06,990 --> 00:51:07,823
- All right.

1358
00:51:07,823 --> 00:51:08,730
This is definitely one
that we are going to

1359
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:09,660
continue to follow with you.

1360
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:12,420
Thank you Allan Smith, NBC News reporter.

1361
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:14,320
We are seeing record closings on

1362
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:16,340
all three major indices right now.

1363
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:18,160
Might be a little early for
us to tell you about this,

1364
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,950
but, in fact, markets closed early today

1365
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:22,240
because tomorrow is the July 4th holiday.

1366
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,440
You are looking at three new records.

1367
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,730
The Dow is at 29,966.

1368
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:30,880
Standard and Poor's just
half-a-point shy of 3,000 points

1369
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,380
and the NASDAQ closing at
yet at yet another record,

1370
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:36,010
8,170 points.

1371
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:37,940
I want to talk about
Nike's latest controversy.

1372
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:41,100
It's all about an historical
flag put on a shoe.

1373
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:43,370
To some that flag's a symbol of hate,

1374
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:44,910
to others America's revolution.

1375
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:46,480
We're gonna look at
all sides of the debate

1376
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,030
and how Nike handled the situation.

1377
00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:51,303
You're watching Velshi
& Ruhle live on MSNBC.

1378
00:52:02,676 --> 00:52:05,926
(soothing piano music)

1379
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:09,750
- [Announcer] Corey is living
with metastatic breast cancer.

1380
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:11,260
Which is breast cancer that has spread

1381
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:12,633
to other parts of her body.

1382
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:17,060
She's also taking Ibrance
with an aromatase inhibitor,

1383
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:19,460
which is for post-menopausal
women or for men

1384
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:22,670
with HR-positive HER2-negative
metastatic breast cancer

1385
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:24,960
as the first hormonal-based therapy.

1386
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,070
Ibrance plus letrozole was significantly

1387
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:29,210
more effective at delaying
disease progression

1388
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:30,620
versus letrozole.

1389
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:32,410
Patients taking Ibrance can develop

1390
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:33,720
low white blood cell counts,

1391
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:36,510
which may cause serious
infections that can lead to death.

1392
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:38,750
Before taking Ibrance, tell
your doctor if you have

1393
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:41,170
fever, chills, or other
signs of infections,

1394
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:43,810
liver or kidney problems,
or pregnant, breast-feeding,

1395
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:45,280
or plan to become pregnant.

1396
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,510
Common side-effects
include low red blood cell

1397
00:52:47,510 --> 00:52:48,710
and low platelet counts,

1398
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:51,430
infections, tireness, nausea, sore mouth,

1399
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:54,020
abnormalities in
liver-blood tests, diarrhea,

1400
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:58,080
hair thinning or loss, vomiting,
rash, and loss of appetite.

1401
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:00,230
Corey calls it her new normal,

1402
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:01,870
because a lot has changed.

1403
00:53:01,870 --> 00:53:03,840
But a lot hasn't.

1404
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,860
Ask your doctor about Ibrance,

1405
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:07,980
the number one prescribed, FDA-approved

1406
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:09,450

00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:36,690
- That.

1417
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:38,920
That's not me, that's HomeAdvisor.

1418
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,800
- [Male Voice] You can't expect
your neighbors to do it all.

1419
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,130
So just ask HomeAdvisor.

1420
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:44,240
- I found a way to relieve my constipation

1421
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,260
that's both gentle and fast.

1422
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:48,300
New Dulcolax Liquid works naturally

1423
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:50,910
with the water in my body
to provide gentle relief

1424
00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:53,120
in as little as 30 minutes.

1425
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:55,250
New, stimulant-free Dulcolax Liquid.

1426
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:57,190
Puts you comfortably in control.

1427
00:53:57,190 --> 00:54:00,040
- Going to the Shawn
Mendes Verizon Up concert

1428
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:02,200
was like an out-of-body experience.

1429
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,349
- [Announcer] Why the Yousafzai
sisters chose Verizon.

1430
00:54:04,349 --> 00:54:05,182
- We were right in front of him.

1431
00:54:05,182 --> 00:54:06,610
- Dead center, front row.

1432
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:08,080
Actually Zermina, you
touched Shawn Mendes.

1433
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,020
You touched Shawn Mendes.
- Yeah, I touched him.

1434
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:10,680
He, like, held my hand for a while.

1435
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:11,860
Then we got to meet him after,

1436
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:12,693
which was like--

1437
00:54:12,693 --> 00:54:13,526
- Another surprise.

1438
00:54:13,526 --> 00:54:15,000
- Yeah, we love Verizon even more now.

1439
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,160
I'll never forget that day, ever.

1440
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,730
- [Announcer] The network
more people rely on

1441
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:19,563
gives you more.

1442
00:54:19,563 --> 00:54:21,230
Like thousands of tickets to concerts,

1443
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:22,920
festivals and private shows.

1444
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,331
And big savings on our best phones when--

1445
00:54:25,331 --> 00:54:28,600
(doorbell rings)

1446
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,577
- Oh!

1447
00:54:31,577 --> 00:54:32,790
Me, it can't be!

1448
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:34,457
I'm not ready!

1449
00:54:34,457 --> 00:54:35,790
I do spin class!

1450
00:54:37,017 --> 00:54:38,000
What?

1451
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,627
The refrigerator, oh come on!

1452
00:54:39,627 --> 00:54:41,680
Do you know how much this cost me?

1453
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:42,780
You're killing me!

1454
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:43,950
(suspenseful orchestral chord)

1455
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:45,190
Let me rephrase that.

1456
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:46,930
- [Announcer] Your
refrigerator, air conditioner,

1457
00:54:46,930 --> 00:54:49,680
water heater will all die sometime.

1458
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:52,630
When they do, your homeowner's
insurance won't cover them.

1459
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:54,640
Be sure your budget's protected with

1460
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:56,730
an American Home Shield home warranty.

1461
00:54:56,730 --> 00:54:58,400
We help cover the cost of repair

1462
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,170
or replace components of
your systems and appliances.

1463
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:02,410
No matter their age.

1464
00:55:02,410 --> 00:55:04,460
Limitations and exclusions apply.

1465
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:07,220
Home systems and appliances
will eventually die.

1466
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:09,300
Count on American Home Shield to get you

1467
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:10,133
back up and running.

1468
00:55:10,133 --> 00:55:11,920
- [Woman] Oh, the air conditioner, too?

1469

1475
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:31,850
- Today Nike and Colin Kaepernick are back

1476
00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:33,210
in the center of controversy

1477
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:34,470
and this time it's over sneakers.

1478
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:37,420
Nike is pulling these
shoes from its inventory,

1479
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:40,290
which feature the so-called
Betsy Ross-version

1480
00:55:40,290 --> 00:55:41,310
of the American flag.

1481
00:55:41,310 --> 00:55:44,770
Now to some people, that
is a flag representing hate

1482
00:55:44,770 --> 00:55:47,030
and slavery because it was in place

1483
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:50,630
at a time when slavery was
enshrined in the United States.

1484
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:55,050
To others, it's a patriotic
symbol of the Revolutionary War.

1485
00:55:55,050 --> 00:55:56,563
NBC's Stephanie Gosk has more.

1486
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:59,190
- [Stephanie] Nike's decision to pull

1487
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:00,900
these red, white and blue shoes

1488
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,720
emblazoned with a colonial-era flag

1489
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:06,330
is whipping even more controversy.

1490
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:09,530
The Governor of Arizona
threatening to pull incentives

1491
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:12,610
for a Nike manufacturing
plant in his state,

1492
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:15,560
calling Nike's recall
a "shameful retreat."

1493
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:18,327
Adding, "words cannot
express my disappointment

1494
00:56:18,327 --> 00:56:20,480
"at this terrible decision."

1495
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,810
The future of the facility,

1496
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:25,480
which would employ about
500 people, is unclear.

1497
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:26,940
According to The Wall Street Journal,

1498
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:29,530
former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick

1499
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:32,640
spearheaded the call to
get Nike to pull the shoe.

1500
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,560
Citing people familiar with the matter,

1501
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:38,300
the report says he was offended
by the use of the flag,

1502
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:39,750
as were others.

1503
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:41,810
In a statement Nike says its decision

1504
00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:43,507
to recall the design was

1505
00:56:43,507 --> 00:56:46,297
"based on concerns that
it could unitentionally

1506
00:56:46,297 --> 00:56:50,230
"offend and detract from the
nation's patriotic holiday."

1507
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:53,710
When the iconic brand revealed
the shoe late last month,

1508
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:56,027
critics spoke out, one writing,

1509
00:56:56,027 --> 00:56:58,580
"Nike you should be ashamed of this shoe."

1510
00:56:58,580 --> 00:57:03,530
Another wrote, "Can't wait for
the Confederate Air Max 90s."

1511
00:57:03,530 --> 00:57:05,360
The so-called Betsy Ross flag,

1512
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:07,340
named after the 18th-century woman

1513
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,400
mythologized for designing it,

1514
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,780
has been flown at some nationalist

1515
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:13,870
and American Nazi rallies.

1516
00:57:13,870 --> 00:57:17,070
Some say it celebrates
the time of slavery.

1517
00:57:17,070 --> 00:57:20,040
While others, including
Texas senator, Ted Cruz,

1518
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:22,710
are renewing calls for a Nike boycott.

1519
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:24,517
Cruz tweeting in part,

1520
00:57:24,517 --> 00:57:28,600
"Their shoes represent snide
disdain for the American flag."

1521
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:30,790
Similar calls were made
when Nike partnered

1522
00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:34,040
with Caepernick last
year in an ad campaign.

1523
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:35,590
- [Colin] Believe in something.

1524
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:39,153
Even if it means sacrificing everything.

1525
00:57:40,350 --> 00:57:42,690
The former quarterback
was the first in the NFL

1526
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:44,950
to kneel during the national anthem,

1527
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:49,030
protesting police brutality
and racial injustice.

1528
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:52,260
Some burned their shoes
and boycotted Nike.

1529
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:54,970
While the company saw its sales rise

1530
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:58,010
and it's stock price surge.

1531
00:57:58,010 --> 00:57:59,850
- Joining me now is NBC's Stephanie Gosk.

1532
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:00,683
Stephanie, I was just saying to you,

1533
00:58:00,683 --> 00:58:02,630
I think that in 25 years,

1534
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:04,790
when we study the
culture wars of this era,

1535
00:58:04,790 --> 00:58:06,000
this will be a case study.

1536
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:06,913
- That's right.

1537
00:58:06,913 --> 00:58:09,720
The moment a sneaker is at the
center of the culture wars.

1538
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:12,111
- And everybody's very dug in
on their position on this one.

1539
00:58:12,111 --> 00:58:14,030
- Yeah, they certainly are.

1540
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:15,063
You know, you could make the argument

1541
00:58:15,063 --> 00:58:17,100
there's a conversation we need to have.

1542
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:20,060
There are clearly people who
are on both sides of this

1543
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:22,570
who are very agitated and upset for,

1544
00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:25,160
quite honestly, understandable reasons.

1545
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:27,470
Where do we come together to talk about it

1546
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:28,792
is really the crucial question.

1547
00:58:28,792 --> 00:58:30,720
- I was surprised in your piece,

1548
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,510
and when I looked at the story,

1549
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:34,050
to find that people associate

1550
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:35,380
this so-called Betsy Ross flag.

1551
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:36,690
It's not clear Betsy Ross designed it,

1552
00:58:36,690 --> 00:58:38,630
she may have just changed the star design,

1553
00:58:38,630 --> 00:58:40,590
with the same feelings that people have

1554
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:42,040
for the Confederate flag.

1555
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:42,873
- Right.

1556
00:58:42,873 --> 00:58:44,410
It's certainly not an overwhelming feeling

1557
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:46,300
and something that's been in the public.

1558
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:48,360
But there have been
these limited examples.

1559
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:51,330
For instance, there was a
chapter of the Ku Klux Klan

1560
00:58:51,330 --> 00:58:53,730
that had some flyers in upstate New York

1561
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:56,224
that used the flag to
try to recruit people.

1562
00:58:56,224 --> 00:58:57,057
- [Ali] Right.

1563
00:58:57,057 --> 00:58:57,890
- To their chapter.

1564
00:58:57,890 --> 00:58:58,723
That's obviously pretty limited.

1565
00:58:58,723 --> 00:59:00,680
There were a couple of
high school students

1566
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:04,010
at a high school football
game a couple of years ago

1567
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:06,290
that were waving the flag and then later

1568
00:59:06,290 --> 00:59:08,920
the superintendent came
out and apologized for that

1569
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,867
saying that this flag had
become what he called,

1570
00:59:11,867 --> 00:59:13,590
"a symbol of hate."

1571
00:59:13,590 --> 00:59:17,280
But those were limited
examples and this controversy,

1572
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:20,040
clearly the most
widespread that we've seen

1573
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:21,260
when it comes to this flag.

1574
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:24,010
- This hasn't really
hurt Nike stock price,

1575
00:59:24,010 --> 00:59:26,180
and Nike has been through controversies.

1576
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:28,950
But Nike understands branding,

1577
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:32,950
possibly more than most
other companies in the world.

1578
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:35,200
Is it interesting that
it got to this point

1579
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,770
without Nike having figured out that

1580
00:59:36,770 --> 00:59:38,560
there might be some
controversy around this.

1581
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:40,120
- It is, and I also think it's a statement

1582
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:43,790
on just how controversial
this flag really is.

1583
00:59:43,790 --> 00:59:47,930
Because like you say, branding, for Nike,

1584
00:59:47,930 --> 00:59:48,790
is second nature.

1585
00:59:48,790 --> 00:59:52,370
They have almost defined branding for us

1586
00:59:52,370 --> 00:59:53,203
in the modern world.

1587
00:59:53,203 --> 00:59:54,520
- None of us knew what that swoosh was

1588
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:55,353
until they invented it.

1589
00:59:55,353 --> 00:59:56,485
- Of marketing, yeah.

1590
00:59:56,485 --> 00:59:59,660
And signing Kaepernick,
you know, in those moments

1591
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:01,380
when there was a lot of criticism,

1592
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:03,550
which they knew they were going to get.

1593
01:00:03,550 --> 01:00:05,120
The burning of the shoes
and the rest of it.

1594
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:07,160
In those immediate moments after that,

1595
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:07,993
they did actually see

1596
01:00:07,993 --> 01:00:10,753
their stock price go up and their shoe--
