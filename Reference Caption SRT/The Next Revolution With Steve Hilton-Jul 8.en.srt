1
00:00:00,261 --> 00:00:02,780
- It's only fitting to say
God bless Texas, thanks guys.

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:04,697
- Amen.
- Appreciate it.

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:08,393
(upbeat music)

4
00:00:09,479 --> 00:00:11,611
- Evening everyone, and
welcome to The Next Revolution.

5
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:13,065
I'm Steve Hilton and this is the home

6
00:00:13,065 --> 00:00:15,438
of the positive populism,
pro-worker, pro-family,

7
00:00:15,438 --> 00:00:19,012
pro-community, and of course
always, but especially

8
00:00:19,012 --> 00:00:22,814
on this July the Fourth
holiday weekend, pro-America.

9
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:24,715
And that's where we start tonight.

10
00:00:24,715 --> 00:00:27,611
There was a time when being
pro-America was a given

11
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:29,785
for politicians in both main parties.

12
00:00:29,785 --> 00:00:32,061
Of course President
Reagan put it beautifully

13
00:00:32,061 --> 00:00:34,537
when he talked of a
shining city on a hill.

14
00:00:34,537 --> 00:00:37,014
But I also love Bill Clinton's great line,

15
00:00:37,014 --> 00:00:39,102
"There's nothing wrong with America

16
00:00:39,102 --> 00:00:42,455
"that can't be fixed by
what's right with America."

17
00:00:42,455 --> 00:00:44,776
But this week, this July the fourth,

18
00:00:44,776 --> 00:00:46,187
we saw that those days are gone.

19
00:00:46,187 --> 00:00:48,589
Yes, we still have a
Republican president who,

20
00:00:48,589 --> 00:00:51,312
like Ronald Reagan is
obviously proud of America

21
00:00:51,312 --> 00:00:54,222
and happy to say it, to celebrate it,

22
00:00:54,222 --> 00:00:58,526
but today's Democrats, no,
they're embarrassed by America.

23
00:00:58,526 --> 00:01:01,708
Far from celebrating America,
they want to tear it down

24
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:03,352
and turn it into something else.

25
00:01:03,352 --> 00:01:05,353
That's the background to President Trump's

26
00:01:05,353 --> 00:01:07,369
Salute to America on Independence Day,

27
00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:11,197
the Democrats couldn't wait to attack it.

28
00:01:11,197 --> 00:01:13,835
- Donald Trump, I believe,
is incapable of celebrating

29
00:01:13,835 --> 00:01:18,182
what makes America great because
I don't think he gets it.

30
00:01:18,182 --> 00:01:20,142
- He doesn't get it, okay look.

31
00:01:20,142 --> 00:01:24,059
Here's some of what the
president actually said.

32
00:01:24,059 --> 00:01:25,758
- Together we are part of one

33
00:01:25,758 --> 00:01:29,939
of the greatest stories ever
told, the story of America.

34
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:33,566
It is the spirit, daring,
and defiance, excellence,

35
00:01:33,566 --> 00:01:37,340
and adventure, courage, and
confidence, loyalty, and love

36
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,841
that built this country into
the most exceptional nation

37
00:01:41,841 --> 00:01:43,476
in the history of the world.

38
00:01:43,476 --> 00:01:48,226
And our nation is stronger
today than it ever was before.

39
00:01:49,236 --> 00:01:52,808
- I think you'll find Joe
China that President Trump gets

40
00:01:52,808 --> 00:01:56,768
what makes America great than
a knackered old swamp creature

41
00:01:56,768 --> 00:01:58,424
who took billions of dollars in bribes

42
00:01:58,424 --> 00:02:01,145
in the form of payments
to his family businesses

43
00:02:01,145 --> 00:02:03,118
from America's number one enemy.

44
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:05,494
You are the last person to lecture anyone

45
00:02:05,494 --> 00:02:08,950
on patriotism, hashtag JoeChina.

46
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:11,600
But it wasn't just him,
it was all of them.

47
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,883
How dare you celebrate
America, cried the left,

48
00:02:14,883 --> 00:02:16,550
it's not who we are.

49
00:02:17,417 --> 00:02:19,548
- It's just not who we are as Americans.

50
00:02:19,548 --> 00:02:22,040
We don't thump our chest,
put tanks in the streets,

51
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,481
fly jets over the Mall
to prove our strength.

52
00:02:25,481 --> 00:02:30,314
- I think reducing our nation
to tanks and shows of muscle

53
00:02:32,339 --> 00:02:35,853
just makes us look like the
kinda loud-mouth guy at the bar.

54
00:02:35,853 --> 00:02:37,349
- I think it's a waste of money.

55
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:39,280
He's having a parade for himself,

56
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,339
putting tanks out there for himself,

57
00:02:41,339 --> 00:02:42,866
and if he really cares
about the men and women

58
00:02:42,866 --> 00:02:45,846
who are serving our nation,
he'd be investing in higher pay,

59
00:02:45,846 --> 00:02:49,058
better housing, better healthcare.

60
00:02:49,058 --> 00:02:51,822
- By the way, that is exactly
what President Trump has done,

61
00:02:51,822 --> 00:02:53,219
unlike President Obama,

62
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:55,508
you total charlatan Kirsten Gillibrand.

63
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,922
But the big point is captured
in that smug platitude

64
00:02:58,922 --> 00:03:01,799
trotted out there by the
ridiculous Eric Swalwell,

65
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:04,854
and the rest of the left these
days, "It's not who we are."

66
00:03:04,854 --> 00:03:08,512
For once that told phrase
told us something useful

67
00:03:08,512 --> 00:03:10,067
about the Democrats this week,

68
00:03:10,067 --> 00:03:12,573
just not the way they intended.

69
00:03:12,573 --> 00:03:15,712
The proud Americans who
stood in the pouring rain

70
00:03:15,712 --> 00:03:18,016
in front of the Lincoln Memorial
to celebrate their country

71
00:03:18,016 --> 00:03:21,920
on July the Fourth know that's
not who the Democrats are.

72
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,461
The millions more who watched at home

73
00:03:23,461 --> 00:03:26,326
and thought finally we have
a president who loves America

74
00:03:26,326 --> 00:03:29,048
as much as we do and isn't
embarrassed to say so,

75
00:03:29,048 --> 00:03:32,331
no that is not who the Democrats are.

76
00:03:32,331 --> 00:03:35,067
The Democrats won't celebrate America

77
00:03:35,067 --> 00:03:37,314
because their new ideology demands

78
00:03:37,314 --> 00:03:39,890
that they denigrate America,

79
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:42,858
not least with their
reckless, divisive lies

80
00:03:42,858 --> 00:03:45,694
about concentration camps at the border,

81
00:03:45,694 --> 00:03:48,889
collusion with Russia, and
Hitler in the White House.

82
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:52,362
Today's Democrats are
engaged in a concerted effort

83
00:03:52,362 --> 00:03:57,198
to smear this country at home
and in the eyes of the world.

84
00:03:57,198 --> 00:04:00,152
When they tell you they don't
want to celebrate America

85
00:04:00,152 --> 00:04:03,652
because it's not who we are, believe them.

86
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:05,854
President Trump, by contrast,

87
00:04:05,854 --> 00:04:08,547
laid out exactly why we should celebrate.

88
00:04:08,547 --> 00:04:11,254
The American spirit he talked
about on Independence Day

89
00:04:11,254 --> 00:04:14,005
has driven some of the most
profound human achievements

90
00:04:14,005 --> 00:04:17,576
in history, from medical
breakthroughs to artistic glories,

91
00:04:17,576 --> 00:04:20,640
to engineering and technological marvels.

92
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,653
American ingenuity has
continually confounded

93
00:04:23,653 --> 00:04:25,741
what the world thinks is possible.

94
00:04:25,741 --> 00:04:26,824
But why, how?

95
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:30,090
It's not just chance or luck.

96
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:32,264
There are other countries
with other people

97
00:04:32,264 --> 00:04:34,669
just as talented and ingenious.

98
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:37,952
Here's my perspective as a recent arrival.

99
00:04:37,952 --> 00:04:40,023
It is America's greatest achievement

100
00:04:40,023 --> 00:04:41,970
that has made all the others possible,

101
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:45,570
and that is the genius framework
constructed by the founders

102
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,570
and expressed in the founding documents,

103
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:50,754
all in service of that simple
but revolutionary idea,

104
00:04:50,754 --> 00:04:53,274
liberty under the law.

105
00:04:53,274 --> 00:04:55,448
It's the guarantee of individual liberty

106
00:04:55,448 --> 00:04:57,709
that gave the pioneers the confidence

107
00:04:57,709 --> 00:04:59,437
to set out into the unknown,

108
00:04:59,437 --> 00:05:01,136
that gave the entrepreneurs the belief

109
00:05:01,136 --> 00:05:02,878
they could build something better,

110
00:05:02,878 --> 00:05:05,960
that convinced communities
they could govern themselves.

111
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:10,208
Power to the people, decentralized
and limited government,

112
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:13,360
the rule of law, these are the foundation

113
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,227
of the American spirit, and
they have paved the way,

114
00:05:16,227 --> 00:05:18,517
not only for America's
long-lasting democracy,

115
00:05:18,517 --> 00:05:22,059
but also our world-beating economic system

116
00:05:22,059 --> 00:05:24,982
in which investment, innovation,
and above all, success,

117
00:05:24,982 --> 00:05:27,200
are rewarded not punished.

118
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,669
And look at the difference it makes

119
00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:31,016
when we have an
administration that believes

120
00:05:31,016 --> 00:05:33,435
in those American economic values,

121
00:05:33,435 --> 00:05:35,766
another incredible jobs report last week,

122
00:05:35,766 --> 00:05:37,796
incomes rising fastest for those

123
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,710
who are left behind under the Democrats,

124
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:43,357
record low unemployment,
and a fairer economy.

125
00:05:43,357 --> 00:05:45,876
For example the gap between white

126
00:05:45,876 --> 00:05:48,466
and African American
unemployment has shrunk

127
00:05:48,466 --> 00:05:51,550
by nearly a half since 2016.

128
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:56,317
The Obama years gave us lower
growth and higher inequality.

129
00:05:56,317 --> 00:05:58,720
With President Trump's
pro-America economics

130
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,162
we have the exact opposite,

131
00:06:00,162 --> 00:06:03,574
higher growth and lower inequality.

132
00:06:03,574 --> 00:06:05,861
But those facts don't
matter to the Democrats.

133
00:06:05,861 --> 00:06:08,614
They've been captured
by an extremist ideology

134
00:06:08,614 --> 00:06:12,025
that is fundamentally anti-American.

135
00:06:12,025 --> 00:06:13,510
You saw it at their
debates the other week,

136
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,915
and it connects everything,
their economic policies,

137
00:06:15,915 --> 00:06:17,816
environmental policies,
healthcare policies,

138
00:06:17,816 --> 00:06:19,688
and yes their hysterical reaction

139
00:06:19,688 --> 00:06:23,115
to President Trump's Salute to America.

140
00:06:23,115 --> 00:06:26,182
Not celebrating America,
but denigrating America.

141
00:06:26,182 --> 00:06:29,480
Now power to the people,
but power for themselves

142
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,453
and the bureaucratic elite.

143
00:06:31,453 --> 00:06:33,123
Not decentralized government,

144
00:06:33,123 --> 00:06:36,058
but everything controlled
from Washington, D.C.

145
00:06:36,058 --> 00:06:38,509
The Democrats don't
want limited government,

146
00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:41,676
they want endless, relentless,
extravagant intervention

147
00:06:41,676 --> 00:06:45,274
by an all-knowing, all-seeing,
all-powerful state.

148
00:06:45,274 --> 00:06:47,378
And here's perhaps the biggest change

149
00:06:47,378 --> 00:06:49,784
from the Democrats of the past.

150
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:53,830
Today's Democrats don't even
want the most vital element

151
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,488
of the American inheritance,
the rule of law.

152
00:06:57,488 --> 00:06:59,403
At their first presidential debate,

153
00:06:59,403 --> 00:07:02,154
almost all of the 2020 candidates backed

154
00:07:02,154 --> 00:07:05,811
the decriminalization
of illegal immigration.

155
00:07:05,811 --> 00:07:07,597
On Wednesday one of them, Cory Booker,

156
00:07:07,597 --> 00:07:11,770
escorted migrants towards
the US border himself.

157
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:14,811
Even President Obama's former
Homeland Security Secretary

158
00:07:14,811 --> 00:07:19,811
now says the Democrats are
effectively for open borders.

159
00:07:19,995 --> 00:07:22,555
The Democrats point to
the Statue of Liberty

160
00:07:22,555 --> 00:07:26,085
and say that immigration
control is un-American.

161
00:07:26,085 --> 00:07:28,610
But they forget one vital thing,

162
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:33,347
it's not just liberty,
it's liberty under the law,

163
00:07:33,347 --> 00:07:36,919
and it is their blatant, thuggish
assault on the rule of law

164
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:39,108
that is truly un-American.

165
00:07:39,108 --> 00:07:42,924
Let me end on a personal
note about America.

166
00:07:42,924 --> 00:07:45,888
I'm an immigrant here, just
as my parents were in England

167
00:07:45,888 --> 00:07:48,122
after they fled Communism in Hungary.

168
00:07:48,122 --> 00:07:49,807
I've always been pro-immigration,

169
00:07:49,807 --> 00:07:51,420
how could I be anything else?

170
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,364
But it's especially
those of us who believe

171
00:07:53,364 --> 00:07:56,100
in the virtues and benefits of immigration

172
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,519
who should want to see
it properly controlled.

173
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:01,051
Because public consent
for immigration depends

174
00:08:01,051 --> 00:08:04,956
on government control of immigration.

175
00:08:04,956 --> 00:08:08,138
That's why immigration has
to be done the right way,

176
00:08:08,138 --> 00:08:09,607
according to the rules.

177
00:08:09,607 --> 00:08:12,069
That's certainly how I've
done it since I moved here

178
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:13,697
with my family seven years ago,

179
00:08:13,697 --> 00:08:16,649
and I thought this July the
Fourth weekend was a good moment

180
00:08:16,649 --> 00:08:19,353
to let you know that I've
now begun the process

181
00:08:19,353 --> 00:08:22,148
of applying for U.S. citizenship.

182
00:08:22,148 --> 00:08:25,706
I can't tell you how much I
appreciate the opportunities

183
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:27,676
this country has given me,

184
00:08:27,676 --> 00:08:30,154
and the welcome you've all shown me.

185
00:08:30,154 --> 00:08:31,594
And now I'm looking forward one day

186
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:34,993
to celebrating Independence
Day as an American,

187
00:08:34,993 --> 00:08:37,243
if you'll have me, that is.

188
00:08:38,161 --> 00:08:41,847
Let me know, @SteveHiltonX,
and @NextRevFNC.

189
00:08:41,847 --> 00:08:43,460
Here now, our guests for the night,

190
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:48,195
Trump 2020 Campaign Senior
Advisor, Katrina Pierson,

191
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,773
and Fox News Contributor,
former Utah Congressman,

192
00:08:50,773 --> 00:08:55,295
and author of the new book
"Power Grab" Jason Chaffetz.

193
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:58,493
All right, lots of topics
in there, immigration,

194
00:08:58,493 --> 00:09:01,141
the Democrats going nuts.

195
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:02,583
Where do you wanna start?

196
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,906
- Well I think I'll start by saying

197
00:09:03,906 --> 00:09:05,823
of course we welcome you.

198
00:09:05,823 --> 00:09:07,191
- That's a relief, thank you.
- I applaud you

199
00:09:07,191 --> 00:09:08,788
on your efforts there.

200
00:09:08,788 --> 00:09:12,712
We need more Americans that
fight like you for this country.

201
00:09:12,712 --> 00:09:15,372
But you know I think you
have it exactly right.

202
00:09:15,372 --> 00:09:17,819
They're not even hiding it anymore, Steve.

203
00:09:17,819 --> 00:09:20,439
The Democrats are anti-American.

204
00:09:20,439 --> 00:09:23,732
And we see it, and we've seen
it for the last few years.

205
00:09:23,732 --> 00:09:25,741
They didn't even have a
flag, during the debate

206
00:09:25,741 --> 00:09:28,362
that you mentioned that they
had last week, on stage.

207
00:09:28,362 --> 00:09:31,285
They've been fighting the
flag for the last few years.

208
00:09:31,285 --> 00:09:33,186
They're anti-American, period.

209
00:09:33,186 --> 00:09:35,790
50% of Americans are deplorables,

210
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,197
and the other 50% are just as expendable

211
00:09:38,197 --> 00:09:40,919
because their main focus and priority

212
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:43,885
are on the families and
children of illegal aliens

213
00:09:43,885 --> 00:09:46,405
and foreign nationals on the way.

214
00:09:46,405 --> 00:09:47,845
So I think you're absolutely right.

215
00:09:47,845 --> 00:09:49,729
I think most Americans see that.

216
00:09:49,729 --> 00:09:54,124
And there were Democrats at
that event in Washington, D.C.,

217
00:09:54,124 --> 00:09:56,860
who watched this president
and who were excited

218
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,695
to be there because there
are some Democrats left

219
00:09:59,695 --> 00:10:03,124
in this country who love
it, and who support it,

220
00:10:03,124 --> 00:10:05,612
because it is the United
States of America.

221
00:10:05,612 --> 00:10:07,211
It is the best country in the world.

222
00:10:07,211 --> 00:10:09,849
It is exactly why everyone
is trying to come here.

223
00:10:09,849 --> 00:10:11,073
- [Steve] Yes that's right,

224
00:10:11,073 --> 00:10:12,814
and I'm one of them, exactly.
- And it's so upsetting

225
00:10:12,814 --> 00:10:14,587
when you show clips that you showed,

226
00:10:14,587 --> 00:10:16,746
what these Democrats were saying.

227
00:10:16,746 --> 00:10:20,205
Frankly in my opinion,
any presidential candidate

228
00:10:20,205 --> 00:10:24,669
that is criticizing saluting
America on Independence Day

229
00:10:24,669 --> 00:10:26,354
should be disqualified.

230
00:10:26,354 --> 00:10:29,347
- I think, well said, I mean look, Jason,

231
00:10:29,347 --> 00:10:31,509
the Democrats would say that's outrageous,

232
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:32,373
we're not anti-American,

233
00:10:32,373 --> 00:10:34,217
we just have a different set of ideas

234
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,492
about how to bring about
change and everything.

235
00:10:36,492 --> 00:10:40,106
But when you actually look at
the way they're running around

236
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:43,071
deliberately distorting
and making stuff up

237
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:45,593
to make America look bad,

238
00:10:45,593 --> 00:10:47,103
and then when you look at the fundamentals

239
00:10:47,103 --> 00:10:49,353
of their shift to the left,

240
00:10:50,498 --> 00:10:52,447
it contradicts something very important

241
00:10:52,447 --> 00:10:55,928
about the kind of spirit
and soul of this country.

242
00:10:55,928 --> 00:10:58,970
- The president believes
in American exceptionalism.

243
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:01,908
I believe in it, and yet
Democrats are almost embarrassed

244
00:11:01,908 --> 00:11:04,154
about the country, they're
embarrassed about the flag,

245
00:11:04,154 --> 00:11:05,911
they're embarrassed that this president

246
00:11:05,911 --> 00:11:08,100
has wrapped himself in the
flag, I mean literally.

247
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,137
Remember that scene where he came out

248
00:11:09,137 --> 00:11:10,361
and he hugged the flag?

249
00:11:10,361 --> 00:11:13,298
But I think that's why
the overwhelming majority

250
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:16,610
of Americans love this president,
because it's the one thing

251
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,266
that's supposed to draw us together,

252
00:11:18,266 --> 00:11:20,253
is the flag of the
United States of America.

253
00:11:20,253 --> 00:11:22,182
It shouldn't be a partisan issue,

254
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:25,538
but the Democrats are choosing
to make it a partisan issue,

255
00:11:25,538 --> 00:11:28,447
and I think they do so at
their own political peril.

256
00:11:28,447 --> 00:11:31,399
And I really like the
sum of what you're saying

257
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,193
in your opening statement,
which I absolutely loved,

258
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:37,274
which is this idea that the rule of law

259
00:11:37,274 --> 00:11:39,131
does give us the liberty,

260
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:40,860
and we do believe in limited government,

261
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,556
and there is a fundamental difference

262
00:11:42,556 --> 00:11:44,561
between what the Democrats believe in,

263
00:11:44,561 --> 00:11:46,372
which is more, bigger government,

264
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,532
and what President Trump is fighting for

265
00:11:48,532 --> 00:11:50,623
which is to increase our liberties

266
00:11:50,623 --> 00:11:53,071
by giving the American
people more chances,

267
00:11:53,071 --> 00:11:55,332
more opportunities, and
a better economy in which

268
00:11:55,332 --> 00:11:57,319
to thrive economically.
- Yeah, because in the past,

269
00:11:57,319 --> 00:11:59,479
I think, you could say
that political debate

270
00:11:59,479 --> 00:12:02,644
over policy areas was within a framework

271
00:12:02,644 --> 00:12:04,949
that was recognizably American,

272
00:12:04,949 --> 00:12:06,996
and different from
anywhere else in the world.

273
00:12:06,996 --> 00:12:09,055
It was really interesting
to me when President Trump

274
00:12:09,055 --> 00:12:12,007
had that great line in
his speech to Congress,

275
00:12:12,007 --> 00:12:14,829
"This will never be a socialist country."

276
00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:16,039
Anywhere else in the world,

277
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:18,170
that would have been a
really weird thing to say.

278
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,589
People would have said well
maybe it will, maybe it won't,

279
00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:22,086
we'll see what happens in the election,

280
00:12:22,086 --> 00:12:26,232
but actually, everyone just
thought that makes sense here

281
00:12:26,232 --> 00:12:28,522
because there's something
about the way socialism

282
00:12:28,522 --> 00:12:31,260
demands this total centralized government

283
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:34,341
that just is fundamentally anti-American.

284
00:12:34,341 --> 00:12:36,962
- Well it is, and the people
in this country won't allow it,

285
00:12:36,962 --> 00:12:39,583
regardless of how things
proceed down the line.

286
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:43,255
But to Jason's point, they
were all about big government,

287
00:12:43,255 --> 00:12:45,185
but it's not about big government.

288
00:12:45,185 --> 00:12:47,920
It is about power, they
just don't say that.

289
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,079
In order to have all of the power,

290
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,889
they have to have the
government as big as possible

291
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:54,918
so that they can control everyone,

292
00:12:54,918 --> 00:12:56,057
they'll exempt themselves,

293
00:12:56,057 --> 00:12:57,782
just like they've always done in the past.

294
00:12:57,782 --> 00:13:01,860
But it is about power and
this erratic derangement

295
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,970
that we see among the
Democrats and in the media,

296
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,663
although I repeat myself, is really coming

297
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:11,954
from this trauma of the
November 2016 election.

298
00:13:11,954 --> 00:13:14,445
And they grasp onto this toxicity,

299
00:13:14,445 --> 00:13:16,476
and that's why you see
them constantly attacking

300
00:13:16,476 --> 00:13:18,460
innocent people as deplorable,

301
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,012
and you see them attacking
inanimate objects

302
00:13:21,012 --> 00:13:23,489
because now they're unhinged because,

303
00:13:23,489 --> 00:13:26,426
and we know this to be true,
because you saw this debate.

304
00:13:26,426 --> 00:13:29,105
You had this plethora of
Democrat candidates out there

305
00:13:29,105 --> 00:13:31,711
who were saying outrageous things

306
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:34,908
with ridiculously stupid policies,

307
00:13:34,908 --> 00:13:36,593
and then what do we have today?

308
00:13:36,593 --> 00:13:39,873
President Trump's approval is
now the highest it's ever been

309
00:13:39,873 --> 00:13:42,756
and that gives you a clue
on where Americans stand

310
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:44,196
on these issues today.

311
00:13:44,196 --> 00:13:46,615
- Well we're gonna look, I'm
sorry, out of time Jason,

312
00:13:46,615 --> 00:13:49,970
but we're gonna look at the
policy shift to the left

313
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,194
a bit later in the show.

314
00:13:51,194 --> 00:13:54,109
And I just want to add as well
as the deb-roar-ah's thing

315
00:13:54,109 --> 00:13:57,114
was so deeply revealing of where they are,

316
00:13:57,114 --> 00:13:58,424
and even though they're gonna say

317
00:13:58,424 --> 00:13:59,807
oh we mustn't make that mistake again,

318
00:13:59,807 --> 00:14:02,498
and they say oh we must understand
the heartland, and so on,

319
00:14:02,498 --> 00:14:04,399
you know they way they talk and act

320
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,273
they really look down their
nose from a cultural perspective

321
00:14:08,273 --> 00:14:09,237
- Yep.
- Absolutely.

322
00:14:09,237 --> 00:14:10,778
- at America, even the food they eat,

323
00:14:10,778 --> 00:14:12,765
and that's why they
can't stand Donald Trump

324
00:14:12,765 --> 00:14:15,170
because he kinda connects
with that and represents that

325
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:16,293
and gives voice to that.

326
00:14:16,293 --> 00:14:17,633
All right, before we take a break

327
00:14:17,633 --> 00:14:20,297
I have to mention the
U.S. women's soccer team

winning the World Cup earlier today.

to the whole squad

the people versus Chief
Justice John Roberts.

334
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:38,184
Yes, it's gonna be a
controversial one, don't go away.

335
00:14:38,184 --> 00:14:40,767
(upbeat music)

336
00:14:43,367 --> 00:14:44,405

- [Group In Unison] For everyone.

343
00:14:58,535 --> 00:15:00,680
- Dear OxiClean, I live on a farm

344
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,632
with my hard-working
husband, two active kids,

345
00:15:03,632 --> 00:15:07,117
lots of horses, and two
dogs, which means I always

346
00:15:07,117 --> 00:15:11,740
have a pile of dirty laundry,
sweaty, stinky laundry.

347
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,188
So when I discovered
OxiClean with odor blasters

348
00:15:14,188 --> 00:15:16,086
I was excited to give it a try.

349
00:15:16,086 --> 00:15:18,594
I just add a scoop to my
laundry, and guess what.

350
00:15:18,594 --> 00:15:20,899
There was no odor, it was gone.

351
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:24,612
Thanks OxiClean for making
life a lot less smelly.

352
00:15:24,612 --> 00:15:28,387
- OxiClean with odor blasters
eliminates tough odors.

Unfortunately
(rumbling and squealing)

361
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,605
it can't do anything about that.

362

I think that's why I can't go to prison.

375

It's not so much the
showers I'm afraid of,

399
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:06,809
- So does Nugenix really work?

free testosterone booster at GNC.

402

- Okay great, but does it work for you?

403
00:17:12,462 --> 00:17:14,800
- [Frank] Oh yeah, my
workouts are incredible now.

404

- It's easy, just send a text
to get a complimentary bottle.

(upbeat music)

421
00:17:56,707 --> 00:17:58,539
- This week the Trump
administration announced

422
00:17:58,539 --> 00:18:00,684
that it still intends to
put a citizenship question

423
00:18:00,684 --> 00:18:03,864
on the 2020 census, despite
an unfavorable ruling

424
00:18:03,864 --> 00:18:05,523
in the Supreme Court the previous week

425
00:18:05,523 --> 00:18:07,582
which temporarily blocked the plan.

426
00:18:07,582 --> 00:18:10,289
But whatever the arguments
about the census question,

427
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:11,974
there was an aspect of the ruling,

428
00:18:11,974 --> 00:18:15,329
and especially the majority
opinion from the Chief Justice,

429
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:18,425
that will have long-lasting
and disastrous consequences

430
00:18:18,425 --> 00:18:21,391
for the country way beyond the census.

431
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,356
And so tonight,

432
00:18:22,356 --> 00:18:26,523
it's the people versus
Chief Justice John Roberts.

433
00:18:30,031 --> 00:18:31,702
The argument used by the Chief Justice

434
00:18:31,702 --> 00:18:34,148
to block the citizenship
question was that the rationale

435
00:18:34,148 --> 00:18:36,940
for the change given by
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross

436
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,058
is that he was responding to a request

437
00:18:39,058 --> 00:18:41,839
from the Justice Department
wasn't the real reason.

438
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:42,977
Documents showed that he was planning

439
00:18:42,977 --> 00:18:45,338
to put the citizenship
question on the census

440
00:18:45,338 --> 00:18:47,902
before the Justice
Department request came in.

441
00:18:47,902 --> 00:18:50,263
But so what, under the Constitution,

442
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:53,417
it's an executive branch
decision that has long been

443
00:18:53,417 --> 00:18:55,260
a legal precedent in this country

444
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,068
that the courts can't object
to executive branch actions

445
00:18:58,068 --> 00:18:59,883
just because there are other reasons

446
00:18:59,883 --> 00:19:02,547
for the decision than those stated.

447
00:19:02,547 --> 00:19:05,497
John Roberts has just
overturned that precedent,

448
00:19:05,497 --> 00:19:08,494
and this will have massive and
deeply damaging implications

449
00:19:08,494 --> 00:19:12,310
for the way things work, or
rather don't work, in America.

450
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,009
In the dissent of the case,

451
00:19:14,009 --> 00:19:16,183
written by Justice Clarence Thomas,

452
00:19:16,183 --> 00:19:20,504
and joined by Justices Gorsuch
and Kavanaugh, he wrote,

453
00:19:20,504 --> 00:19:23,601
"The court has opened a Pandora's Box

454
00:19:23,601 --> 00:19:27,692
"of pretext-based challenges
in administrative law."

455
00:19:27,692 --> 00:19:30,774
All right, so what does all
this mean in plain English,

456
00:19:30,774 --> 00:19:32,761
and what does it mean for you?

457
00:19:32,761 --> 00:19:35,540
How many times have you been
frustrated that something

458
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,636
this administration wants
to do has been overruled,

459
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:40,969
overturned, struck down, slowed down,

460
00:19:40,969 --> 00:19:43,820
or watered down by the courts?

461
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,017
You voted to build the wall,
but the courts said no.

462
00:19:47,017 --> 00:19:48,860
You voted to defund sanctuary cities,

463
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,300
but the courts said no.

464
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,273
On DACA, on asylum, on healthcare,

465
00:19:52,273 --> 00:19:53,841
on rolling back some regulations,

466
00:19:53,841 --> 00:19:56,247
even on blocking immigration
from failed states

467
00:19:56,247 --> 00:19:57,785
with high levels of terrorism,

468
00:19:57,785 --> 00:20:02,483
the courts said no to
policies that you voted for.

469
00:20:02,483 --> 00:20:05,003
All in all, unelected judges have ruled

470
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:07,724
against the Trump administration
more than 70 times

471
00:20:07,724 --> 00:20:09,035
in the last three years,

472
00:20:09,035 --> 00:20:12,361
way more than the rate for
previous administrations.

473
00:20:12,361 --> 00:20:14,823
This is what happens when you vote

474
00:20:14,823 --> 00:20:16,695
for a populist revolution.

475
00:20:16,695 --> 00:20:19,115
The establishment tries to overturn it

476
00:20:19,115 --> 00:20:21,260
through undemocratic means.

477
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:24,529
And now this ruling from
Chief Justice Roberts

478
00:20:24,529 --> 00:20:26,963
will make it all 10 times worse.

479
00:20:26,963 --> 00:20:29,641
From now on, any partisan pressure group

480
00:20:29,641 --> 00:20:32,910
will be able to take legal
action against the administration

481
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,911
on all sorts of spurious grounds,

482
00:20:34,911 --> 00:20:37,875
helping, as Justice Thomas says, quote,

483
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:41,920
"partisans to use the courts
to harangue executive officers

484
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,982
"through depositions, discovery,
delay, and distraction."

485
00:20:45,982 --> 00:20:48,244
Great, that's just what we need,

486
00:20:48,244 --> 00:20:50,891
an even more politicized judiciary,

487
00:20:50,891 --> 00:20:52,938
even more roadblocks in the way

488
00:20:52,938 --> 00:20:55,659
of actually getting things
done that help your life.

489
00:20:55,659 --> 00:20:58,958
The worst of it all is
John Roberts own rationale

490
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,828
for this, his own motive,

491
00:21:00,828 --> 00:21:05,006
for him it is all about
the image of the Court.

492
00:21:05,006 --> 00:21:06,834
Now that he's the swing vote,

493
00:21:06,834 --> 00:21:10,525
he doesn't want to make
his court look partisan.

494
00:21:10,525 --> 00:21:13,530
So the other week he balanced
his ruling on gerrymandering

495
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:14,870
with this damaging one

496
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:18,095
on judicial review of executive decisions.

497
00:21:18,095 --> 00:21:20,759
But he's supposed to be the Chief Justice,

498
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:22,559
not the chief PR.

499
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,834
He's supposed to interpret
the Constitution,

500
00:21:24,834 --> 00:21:28,348
not what the media will
say about his court.

501
00:21:28,348 --> 00:21:32,250
This ruling will hurt
America for years to come.

502
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,526
It should haunt Chief Justice Roberts

503
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:36,412
for the rest of his time on the bench.

504
00:21:36,412 --> 00:21:38,931
But above all, it shows the importance

505
00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:42,345
of taking his power away
by reelecting Donald Trump

506
00:21:42,345 --> 00:21:46,895
so he can put Roberts in the
minority where he belongs.

507
00:21:46,895 --> 00:21:48,393
Okay, tell me what you think of that,

508
00:21:48,393 --> 00:21:50,796
@SteveHiltonX and @NextRevFNC.

509
00:21:50,796 --> 00:21:52,799
Jason Chaffetz.
- No, well said.

510
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,282
I think this is one of the worst decisions

511
00:21:54,282 --> 00:21:57,580
and put on a list of bad
decisions from Justice Roberts.

512
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,798
I think Clarence Thomas had it right.

513
00:21:59,798 --> 00:22:03,686
You don't want these judges
making subjective rulings

514
00:22:03,686 --> 00:22:05,181
from the bench based on

515
00:22:05,181 --> 00:22:07,228
whatever political whims that they want.

516
00:22:07,228 --> 00:22:10,382
Inherently the legislative
branch is political,

517
00:22:10,382 --> 00:22:13,780
and it will change from time
to time, but that's okay.

518
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,580
You shouldn't have to state the reason

519
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:18,878
and try to get into the mind
and try to be the mind reader

520
00:22:18,878 --> 00:22:20,588
of what they were really looking for,

521
00:22:20,588 --> 00:22:22,434
especially in this case of the census

522
00:22:22,434 --> 00:22:24,465
where they have precedent
in order to do it.

523
00:22:24,465 --> 00:22:26,164
So I know we're gonna
talk more about that,

524
00:22:26,164 --> 00:22:29,692
but really this is a bad decision.

525
00:22:29,692 --> 00:22:32,702
They can't let the courts
just try to be mind readers,

526
00:22:32,702 --> 00:22:35,884
and then subject their
own will upon the court.

527
00:22:35,884 --> 00:22:37,079
That's not what they're supposed to do.

528
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:38,213
- Yeah, I mean the thing is Katrina,

529
00:22:38,213 --> 00:22:40,218
some people have made the
comparison with his decision

530
00:22:40,218 --> 00:22:42,882
on Obamacare back in 2012, wasn't it,

531
00:22:42,882 --> 00:22:47,502
where he basically voted
to let most of it stand.

532
00:22:47,502 --> 00:22:49,275
And the real reason people speculated was

533
00:22:49,275 --> 00:22:51,867
that he didn't want to look
as if he was killing off

534
00:22:51,867 --> 00:22:55,611
something that was just
a political priority

535
00:22:55,611 --> 00:22:56,921
for the then-president.

536
00:22:56,921 --> 00:23:00,176
But now, for the same kind of reason,

537
00:23:00,176 --> 00:23:02,621
to sort of oh it's all about
image, he's done something

538
00:23:02,621 --> 00:23:05,244
that actually wasn't just a
one off thing like Obamacare,

539
00:23:05,244 --> 00:23:09,391
this will hurt so many
different areas of policy,

540
00:23:09,391 --> 00:23:11,940
and stop, people are so
frustrated, government,

541
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,086
nothing ever happens,
this is all just talk

542
00:23:14,086 --> 00:23:16,358
and nothing gets done, this is why.

543
00:23:16,358 --> 00:23:18,939
- Well it is why, and it seems
like Chief Justice Roberts

544
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:23,172
wants his legacy to be
generational destruction.

545
00:23:23,172 --> 00:23:25,186
It was far worse back with Obamacare

546
00:23:25,186 --> 00:23:28,757
because it was unconstitutional
and at that point in time

547
00:23:28,757 --> 00:23:33,123
you had Justice Roberts
literally bent over backwards,

548
00:23:33,123 --> 00:23:36,377
trying to reform the
individual mandate into a tax,

549
00:23:36,377 --> 00:23:39,197
therefore it would be good to go,

550
00:23:39,197 --> 00:23:40,810
something that our Congress,

551
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:43,505
the people who actually
represent the people,

552
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,043
didn't even vote on.

553
00:23:45,043 --> 00:23:47,278
There was no tax that was
voted on with Obamacare,

554
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:50,345
but oh this is fine, let's just
push this right on through.

555
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:53,369
And that has been
destructive for generations,

556
00:23:53,369 --> 00:23:56,624
as we've seen, and now here
we are with something that,

557
00:23:56,624 --> 00:23:58,939
to Jason's point, it's not unprecedented.

558
00:23:58,939 --> 00:24:02,787
This was a question that was
on the census before in history

559
00:24:02,787 --> 00:24:03,867
so it's not brand new,

560
00:24:03,867 --> 00:24:06,747
it's not like the president
seizing power of anything,

561
00:24:06,747 --> 00:24:09,512
and the intent by someone
who recommended it,

562
00:24:09,512 --> 00:24:11,225
now all of the sudden is directing

563
00:24:11,225 --> 00:24:13,902
the Supreme Court of the United States?

564
00:24:13,902 --> 00:24:15,948
This is insanity?
- That's what drives me crazy.

565
00:24:15,948 --> 00:24:18,137
I've worked inside of a government,

566
00:24:18,137 --> 00:24:19,577
you've obviously been in Con,

567
00:24:19,577 --> 00:24:23,508
there's so many factors, and
conversations, and meetings,

568
00:24:23,508 --> 00:24:26,216
and discussions, and memos, all of that,

569
00:24:26,216 --> 00:24:30,633
now can be got hold of by
any kind of legal challenge

570
00:24:31,558 --> 00:24:34,595
of any kind of political
decision, it's a total nightmare.

571
00:24:34,595 --> 00:24:35,964
- And there are those
of us that are worried

572
00:24:35,964 --> 00:24:37,317
that when it goes to the courts,

573
00:24:37,317 --> 00:24:40,227
they can make that sorta
subjective analysis

574
00:24:40,227 --> 00:24:42,473
and say well this one's right
and this one's not right.

575
00:24:42,473 --> 00:24:44,028
That's not what they're supposed to do.

576
00:24:44,028 --> 00:24:46,088
The court is supposed
to rule whether or not

577
00:24:46,088 --> 00:24:49,411
they can add a question or
not, it should be that simple.

578
00:24:49,411 --> 00:24:51,011
But they've opened up this box because,

579
00:24:51,011 --> 00:24:52,481
I think you're exactly right Steve,

580
00:24:52,481 --> 00:24:53,618
it's not just this case.

581
00:24:53,618 --> 00:24:56,369
It is going to live on in perpetuity,

582
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:58,370
and it will create all kinds of problems.

583
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,443
It will empower the court more

584
00:25:00,443 --> 00:25:03,094
to make subjective decisions.
- And court all the way down,

585
00:25:03,094 --> 00:25:05,057
this is not just,
- Yes.

586
00:25:05,057 --> 00:25:07,529
- You have the state
level, it just opens up

587
00:25:07,529 --> 00:25:09,660
this possibility that you
try and get anything done,

588
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,014
I mean we already know how bad it is,

589
00:25:11,014 --> 00:25:12,698
it's just gonna get worse.

590
00:25:12,698 --> 00:25:14,657
And people are gonna
get more disillusioned

591
00:25:14,657 --> 00:25:16,802
with politics and government
because it's gonna get

592
00:25:16,802 --> 00:25:19,481
even more impossible to do anything.

593
00:25:19,481 --> 00:25:21,543
- Well we've always said
that it's President Trump

594
00:25:21,543 --> 00:25:24,711
against the world, and every
day we see that to be true,

595
00:25:24,711 --> 00:25:26,380
more and more over time.

596
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:29,161
But hopefully the president
will be able to move forward

597
00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:30,889
on this either through executive action

598
00:25:30,889 --> 00:25:34,071
or some other manner, to again force this

599
00:25:34,071 --> 00:25:36,071
through the court system.

600
00:25:36,071 --> 00:25:37,642
It is common sense,

601
00:25:37,642 --> 00:25:40,392
a country has a right to know who's in it.

602
00:25:40,392 --> 00:25:43,863
This is not some weird twisted thing

603
00:25:43,863 --> 00:25:46,887
that they're trying to make it out to be.

604
00:25:46,887 --> 00:25:49,522
This is a power grab, this is what it is.

605
00:25:49,522 --> 00:25:51,639
The Democrats want as many
people in this country

606
00:25:51,639 --> 00:25:54,130
as possible because the numbers,

607
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:56,348
aside from whether or
not they're citizens,

608
00:25:56,348 --> 00:25:59,170
gives them the electoral advantage

609
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:01,446
when it comes to
distribution of Congressman,

610
00:26:01,446 --> 00:26:02,612
and they want more of that.

611
00:26:02,612 --> 00:26:05,578
It is all about a power grab,
that's what it's always been.

612
00:26:05,578 --> 00:26:07,695
They don't care about people,
they don't care about race,

613
00:26:07,695 --> 00:26:08,919
they don't care about gender,

614
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:10,817
they just want the people on their side.

615
00:26:10,817 --> 00:26:12,260
- Well there you are, so that,

616
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,794
as you mentioned, we're
gonna be talking more

617
00:26:14,794 --> 00:26:16,637
about that aspect of it,

618
00:26:16,637 --> 00:26:17,804
that was the sort of central ruling.

619
00:26:17,804 --> 00:26:19,270
I wanted to make sure everyone understood

620
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,986
the wider implications of the ruling,

621
00:26:20,986 --> 00:26:22,369
but specific on the census question,

622
00:26:22,369 --> 00:26:25,047
we're gonna be talking about
that on tomorrow's Deep Dive

623
00:26:25,047 --> 00:26:27,495
on Fox Nation, go to
foxnation.com and sign up

624
00:26:27,495 --> 00:26:28,688
if you haven't done that already,

625
00:26:28,688 --> 00:26:29,655
gonna be a great discussion.

626
00:26:29,655 --> 00:26:31,538
All right, coming up, Senator Josh Hawley

on sensitive American technology

629
00:26:36,164 --> 00:26:39,274
and the law he introduced to stop it.

Event ends July 8th.

650
00:27:13,393 --> 00:27:15,063
- Let's be honest, you don't really talk

651
00:27:15,063 --> 00:27:17,915
about your insurance unless
you're complaining about it.

652
00:27:17,915 --> 00:27:18,951
You go on about how.

653
00:27:18,951 --> 00:27:20,737
- It's so confusing, it hurts my brain.

654
00:27:20,737 --> 00:27:21,570
- Yeah, I hear ya.

655
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:22,926
- Or you say you can't believe.

656
00:27:22,926 --> 00:27:24,207
- How much of a hassle it is.

657
00:27:24,207 --> 00:27:25,761
- And tell anyone who'll listen.

658
00:27:25,761 --> 00:27:27,289
(woman speaks gibberish)

659
00:27:27,289 --> 00:27:28,830
She said it's so expensive.

660
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:29,867
- Tell me about it.

661
00:27:29,867 --> 00:27:31,710
- Yes, I'm telling the people at home.

662

used to his whole room

- It's not just 3%, sometimes it's 8%,

but you're always getting cash back.

707
00:29:30,029 --> 00:29:31,397
- The way cash back works on Rakuten

708
00:29:31,397 --> 00:29:33,370
is so they get a commission from the store

709
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:34,983
and then they share
that commission with me.

money to spend because you got

- Welcome back everyone.

720
00:29:56,771 --> 00:29:57,996
Last week I had the chance to talk

721
00:29:57,996 --> 00:29:59,969
to Missouri Senator Josh Hawley

722
00:29:59,969 --> 00:30:01,911
about his positive and practical plan

723
00:30:01,911 --> 00:30:06,765
to protect the U.S. from the
China threat, take a look.

724
00:30:06,765 --> 00:30:09,343
One of the members of
Congress who has been toughest

725
00:30:09,343 --> 00:30:12,770
on the threat from China
is Senator Josh Hawley

726
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:15,319
from Missouri, he joins us now.

727
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:17,464
Senator, I've been watching
what you've been doing

728
00:30:17,464 --> 00:30:19,495
and saying on China with great approval,

729
00:30:19,495 --> 00:30:20,906
I'm very excited to talk to you about it.

730
00:30:20,906 --> 00:30:23,297
First of all, big picture,

731
00:30:23,297 --> 00:30:26,277
how would you set out for
us the threat from China?

732
00:30:26,277 --> 00:30:28,322
- The threat from China is
the most significant threat

733
00:30:28,322 --> 00:30:30,223
of the 21st century in many ways.

734
00:30:30,223 --> 00:30:32,585
I mean they've already
taken our jobs, Steve.

735
00:30:32,585 --> 00:30:34,658
They're trying to steal our technology.

736
00:30:34,658 --> 00:30:36,113
They're trying to build their military

737
00:30:36,113 --> 00:30:38,359
on the back of our middle class.

738
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:40,116
And it's time that we
got tough with China,

739
00:30:40,116 --> 00:30:41,426
I mean we can't continue to allow them

740
00:30:41,426 --> 00:30:42,866
to run roughshod over us.

741
00:30:42,866 --> 00:30:45,602
That means getting tough
with them on trade.

742
00:30:45,602 --> 00:30:48,035
It means getting tough with
them on stealing our technology

743
00:30:48,035 --> 00:30:49,533
and stealing our jobs.

744
00:30:49,533 --> 00:30:52,999
- One specific aspect I think
that you've rightly focused on

745
00:30:52,999 --> 00:30:57,374
is the connection between
our technology companies

746
00:30:57,374 --> 00:30:59,386
and the Chinese military,

747
00:30:59,386 --> 00:31:01,100
and you've got a specific
proposal on that,

748
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,684
tell us about that.

749
00:31:02,684 --> 00:31:05,045
- My proposal is this,
that Chinese researchers

750
00:31:05,045 --> 00:31:07,580
who want to come over to the United States

751
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:10,172
should have to, and work
on sensitive technologies

752
00:31:10,172 --> 00:31:13,052
in our labs, should have to go
through background screening

753
00:31:13,052 --> 00:31:15,572
to make sure that they're
not actually agents

754
00:31:15,572 --> 00:31:17,919
of the Chinese government
or the Chinese military.

755
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:22,093
It's just an additional layer
of security to make sure that,

756
00:31:22,093 --> 00:31:26,271
again, China is not using
their researchers to be spies.

757
00:31:26,271 --> 00:31:28,964
And unfortunately we know that
China has tried to do this,

758
00:31:28,964 --> 00:31:31,484
and by the way so has
Russia, and so has Iran.

759
00:31:31,484 --> 00:31:33,413
So my bill would put a stop to that.

760
00:31:33,413 --> 00:31:34,378
It would say that you've gotta go

761
00:31:34,378 --> 00:31:35,716
through this extra background check

762
00:31:35,716 --> 00:31:39,346
if you wanna work on sensitive
technology in American labs.

763
00:31:39,346 --> 00:31:43,513
- What about the way in
which China over the years

764
00:31:44,976 --> 00:31:48,906
has really kind of burrowed
into our establishment,

765
00:31:48,906 --> 00:31:52,205
not just academia and
the scientific world,

766
00:31:52,205 --> 00:31:54,279
as you've just described,
the technology world,

767
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:56,667
but honestly when you look at Washington

768
00:31:56,667 --> 00:32:00,602
and the Chinese influence through
think tanks, and lobbying,

769
00:32:00,602 --> 00:32:03,252
and so on, there's one
particularly egregious example

770
00:32:03,252 --> 00:32:04,648
that we've highlighted on this show,

771
00:32:04,648 --> 00:32:09,648
which is President Obama's
former Head of Cybersecurity,

772
00:32:09,789 --> 00:32:14,181
now working for Jones Day, a
law firm in Washington, D.C.,

773
00:32:14,181 --> 00:32:18,472
as a declared lobbyist for
Huawei, which our government

774
00:32:18,472 --> 00:32:20,661
has designated a national security threat.

775
00:32:20,661 --> 00:32:22,836
Don't you think that whole practice

776
00:32:22,836 --> 00:32:25,836
of lobbying for a foreign government

777
00:32:27,055 --> 00:32:30,093
that is basically a strategic
threat to this country

778
00:32:30,093 --> 00:32:32,484
should not just be declared,

779
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:35,652
as it has been in this
case, but actually outlawed?

780
00:32:35,652 --> 00:32:38,186
- I would say that that's
very, very concerning, Steve,

781
00:32:38,186 --> 00:32:40,908
and you are absolutely right
that the Chinese government,

782
00:32:40,908 --> 00:32:43,871
the Chinese military has
worked to gain access

783
00:32:43,871 --> 00:32:45,919
to our universities, to think tanks.

784
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,476
They have worked to weaponize
in many ways our free system,

785
00:32:49,476 --> 00:32:51,146
whether it's our open trade system,

786
00:32:51,146 --> 00:32:53,840
which they have cheated at
systematically for years,

787
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,913
or whether it's trying
to conduct espionage

788
00:32:55,913 --> 00:32:57,613
on our own college campuses,

789
00:32:57,613 --> 00:32:59,815
or whether it's forcing American companies

790
00:32:59,815 --> 00:33:01,227
who want to do business in China

791
00:33:01,227 --> 00:33:03,819
to sign these technology
transfer agreements

792
00:33:03,819 --> 00:33:05,806
whereby they take all of our tech and then

793
00:33:05,806 --> 00:33:07,808
ultimately don't give us
access to the market anyway.

794
00:33:07,808 --> 00:33:11,422
So it is time that we realized
the threat that China poses

795
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:14,677
to our middle class, to
our safety and security,

796
00:33:14,677 --> 00:33:16,015
and got serious about it.

797
00:33:16,015 --> 00:33:18,449
- Would you go so far
as to say that there's

798
00:33:18,449 --> 00:33:23,315
a comparison here with the
Cold War and the Soviet Union?

799
00:33:23,315 --> 00:33:24,973
A lot of people are
talking in those terms.

800
00:33:24,973 --> 00:33:27,406
And that actually we
should really be looking

801
00:33:27,406 --> 00:33:29,523
at some kind of systematic disengagement,

802
00:33:29,523 --> 00:33:32,086
or at least reducing
our dependence on China,

803
00:33:32,086 --> 00:33:34,419
because we would never have made ourselves

804
00:33:34,419 --> 00:33:36,094
so economically, and technologically,

805
00:33:36,094 --> 00:33:39,187
and in other ways dependent
on the Soviet Union, would we?

806
00:33:39,187 --> 00:33:41,390
- I think we absolutely need to make sure

807
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:43,089
we are not dependent on China.

808
00:33:43,089 --> 00:33:44,772
And we need to recognize
them for what they are,

809
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:47,382
which is at best a strategic competitor,

810
00:33:47,382 --> 00:33:48,909
probably an adversary.

811
00:33:48,909 --> 00:33:50,838
I mean just look right now
Steve at how they're trying

812
00:33:50,838 --> 00:33:54,049
to hold hostage farmers, for
instance, farmers in my state,

813
00:33:54,049 --> 00:33:56,800
making them the focus of
retaliation on these tariffs.

814
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,291
That's the kind of game
China plays, they cheat,

815
00:33:59,291 --> 00:34:00,945
and then when you try to
hold them accountable,

816
00:34:00,945 --> 00:34:03,969
they strike back, they
try to inflict pain.

817
00:34:03,969 --> 00:34:05,454
We've got to put ourselves in a position

818
00:34:05,454 --> 00:34:09,126
to compete with them, to win,
and to protect our people.

819
00:34:09,126 --> 00:34:11,160
- All right, last question.

820
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:15,493
So we've been really focusing
on one particular individual

821
00:34:15,493 --> 00:34:17,926
and his connections to China,

822
00:34:17,926 --> 00:34:20,719
that's former vice president Joe Biden.

823
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,814
We've been telling our
audience week after week

824
00:34:23,814 --> 00:34:26,348
how he is compromised by China,

825
00:34:26,348 --> 00:34:29,691
while he was vice president,
billions of dollars

826
00:34:29,691 --> 00:34:33,858
from the Chinese state to
Biden family businesses.

827
00:34:35,059 --> 00:34:38,518
It seems to me extraordinary
that there's no real interest

828
00:34:38,518 --> 00:34:41,398
in following this up, other than here

829
00:34:41,398 --> 00:34:42,752
and a few other places on this channel.

830
00:34:42,752 --> 00:34:44,840
What do you think we should,

831
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,457
don't you think that this
should be properly investigated?

832
00:34:47,457 --> 00:34:51,175
Joe China as I like to call
him should be investigated.

833
00:34:51,175 --> 00:34:53,509
- Absolutely, I think we
need to follow the evidence

834
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:56,689
to where it leads, and you can
see in Joe Biden's comments

835
00:34:56,689 --> 00:34:58,837
about China saying that
they're not really a threat,

836
00:34:58,837 --> 00:35:01,169
saying that they really
aren't a competitor,

837
00:35:01,169 --> 00:35:03,027
that we don't have
anything to worry about.

838
00:35:03,027 --> 00:35:05,057
I mean, Steve, the best thing
you can say about that is

839
00:35:05,057 --> 00:35:06,742
is that it's just totally ignorant,

840
00:35:06,742 --> 00:35:08,672
I mean it is willful ignorance.

841
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:11,278
China is a huge threat to us,
and they have been for years.

842
00:35:11,278 --> 00:35:14,317
Look at the jobs that they have
taken from American workers,

843
00:35:14,317 --> 00:35:16,462
from workers in my home state of Missouri,

844
00:35:16,462 --> 00:35:18,377
and that's the tip of the iceberg.

845
00:35:18,377 --> 00:35:22,068
They wanna be a global
superpower at our expense.

846
00:35:22,068 --> 00:35:23,576
We cannot let them.

847
00:35:23,576 --> 00:35:25,072
- All right, well I'm
really pleased to see

848
00:35:25,072 --> 00:35:28,659
that you recognize this
threat for what it is

849
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:30,243
and you're there fighting

850
00:35:30,243 --> 00:35:32,273
on behalf of our national interest.

851
00:35:32,273 --> 00:35:34,289
Great to see you this
evening, thank you Senator.

852
00:35:34,289 --> 00:35:35,289
- Thank you.

853
00:35:36,305 --> 00:35:37,817
- Coming up, a Swamp Watch update.

854
00:35:37,817 --> 00:35:39,776
Billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein

855
00:35:39,776 --> 00:35:42,080
was arrested by the Feds last night.

856
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,880
But what about some accountability

857
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,019
from the man who gave
him a sweetheart deal?

858
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:48,747
The details are next.

859
00:35:48,747 --> 00:35:51,330
(upbeat music)

860
00:35:53,355 --> 00:35:54,188
(phones ring)

861
00:35:54,188 --> 00:35:56,249
- Uh oh, looks like
someone's still nervous

862
00:35:56,249 --> 00:35:57,704
about buying a new house.

863
00:35:57,704 --> 00:35:59,632
- Is it that obvious?

864
00:35:59,632 --> 00:36:02,225
- Yes it is, you know
maybe you'd worry less

865
00:36:02,225 --> 00:36:05,134
if you got Geico to help with
your homeowner's insurance.

866
00:36:05,134 --> 00:36:07,453
- I didn't know Geico helps
with homeowner's insurance.

867
00:36:07,453 --> 00:36:10,786
- Yeah, they've been doin' it for years.

868
00:36:11,729 --> 00:36:13,400
What are you doing?

869
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,233
Hey Steve?

870
00:36:15,981 --> 00:36:18,855
- Thanks man.
- There he is.

871
00:36:18,855 --> 00:36:20,233
- [Announcer] Get to know
Geico and see how much

872
00:36:20,233 --> 00:36:23,269
you could save on homeowner's
and renter's insurance.

873
00:36:23,269 --> 00:36:27,214
- [Narrator] Every year it
all starts in the same place.

874
00:36:27,214 --> 00:36:28,352
(grunts)

875
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,721
- Right there, right there.

876
00:36:29,721 --> 00:36:30,942
- [Narrator] Training camp.

877
00:36:30,942 --> 00:36:32,213
- Get something out of the drill,

878
00:36:32,213 --> 00:36:33,595
everything we do is for a reason.

879
00:36:33,595 --> 00:36:35,107
- [Narrator] And NFL
Network has nine hours

880
00:36:35,107 --> 00:36:36,937
of coverage every day.

881
00:36:36,937 --> 00:36:38,074
- [Man] Do the little things right,

882
00:36:38,074 --> 00:36:40,678
and the big things will
take care of themselves.

883
00:36:40,678 --> 00:36:43,504
- [Narrator] With access to all 32 teams.

884
00:36:43,504 --> 00:36:45,477
- Nice job, that a way!

885
00:36:45,477 --> 00:36:47,649
- [Narrator] It's time to go to work.

886
00:36:47,649 --> 00:36:52,603
Inside Training Camp Live
starts July 22nd on NFL Network.

887
00:36:52,603 --> 00:36:54,580
- [Woman] Dear Oxiclean, I live on a farm

888
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,782
with my hard-working
husband, two active kids,

889
00:36:56,782 --> 00:37:00,180
and lots of horses, so I use
OxiClean with odor blasters.

890
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:03,881
Just one scoop and odor's
gone, thanks OxiClean.

891
00:37:03,881 --> 00:37:07,654
- OxiClean with odor blasters
eliminates tough odors.

892
00:37:07,654 --> 00:37:08,487
(applause)
- Priceline will partner

893
00:37:08,487 --> 00:37:09,915
with even more Vegas hotels

894
00:37:09,915 --> 00:37:12,579
to turn their unsold
rooms into amazing deals.

895
00:37:12,579 --> 00:37:13,760
Delegates, how do you vote?

896
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,488
(screaming)

897
00:37:15,488 --> 00:37:18,930
♪ Yeah, yes, yes ♪

898
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:20,125
- [Woman] That is freaky.

899
00:37:20,125 --> 00:37:22,657
Priceline, every trip is a big deal.

900
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:24,877
- [Narrator] With moderate
to severe ulcerative colitis

901
00:37:24,877 --> 00:37:28,544
or Crohn's your plans
can change in minutes.

902
00:37:29,738 --> 00:37:32,293
Your head wants to do one thing,

903
00:37:32,293 --> 00:37:35,216
but your gut says not today.

904
00:37:35,216 --> 00:37:36,915
If your current treatment isn't working,

905
00:37:36,915 --> 00:37:38,828
ask your doctor about Entyvio.

906
00:37:38,828 --> 00:37:41,365
Entyvio acts specifically in the GI tract

907
00:37:41,365 --> 00:37:43,208
to prevent an excess of white blood cells

908
00:37:43,208 --> 00:37:45,858
from entering and causing
damaging inflammation.

909
00:37:45,858 --> 00:37:47,372
Entyvio has helped many patients

910
00:37:47,372 --> 00:37:50,108
achieve long-term relief and remission.

911
00:37:50,108 --> 00:37:52,398
Infusion and serious
allergic reactions can happen

912
00:37:52,398 --> 00:37:54,159
during or after treatment.

913
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:56,387
Entyvio may increase risk of infection,

914
00:37:56,387 --> 00:37:57,553
which can be serious.

915
00:37:57,553 --> 00:38:01,052
PML, a rare, serious,
potentially fatal brain infection

916
00:38:01,052 --> 00:38:03,545
caused by a virus may be possible.

917
00:38:03,545 --> 00:38:05,401
Tell your doctor if you have an infection,

918
00:38:05,401 --> 00:38:07,099
experience frequent infections,

919
00:38:07,099 --> 00:38:09,564
or have flu-like symptoms or sores.

920
00:38:09,564 --> 00:38:11,796
Liver problems can occur with Entyvio.

921
00:38:11,796 --> 00:38:15,238
Ask your doctor about the
only GI-focused biologic,

922
00:38:15,238 --> 00:38:18,017
just for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's.

923
00:38:18,017 --> 00:38:21,600
Entyvio, relief and
remission within reach.

924
00:38:22,623 --> 00:38:25,073
- I didn't really know anything
about my family history.

925
00:38:25,073 --> 00:38:26,542
Went to Ancestry, I put in the names

926
00:38:26,542 --> 00:38:29,854
of my grandparents first,
I got a leaf right away.

927
00:38:29,854 --> 00:38:32,676
A leaf is a hint that is connected

928
00:38:32,676 --> 00:38:35,064
to each person in your family tree.

929
00:38:35,064 --> 00:38:37,544
I learned that my 10
times great grandmother

930
00:38:37,544 --> 00:38:39,329
is George Washington's aunt.

931
00:38:39,329 --> 00:38:42,267
Within a few days, I went
from knowing almost nothing

932
00:38:42,267 --> 00:38:45,921
to holy crow I'm related
to George Washington.

933
00:38:45,921 --> 00:38:47,620
This is my cousin George.

937
00:38:58,684 --> 00:39:00,888
- Remember Jeffrey Epstein,
the hedge fund billionaire

938
00:39:00,888 --> 00:39:03,494
who ran a repulsive
under-age sex pyramid scheme

939
00:39:03,494 --> 00:39:05,280
and was handed a cushy plea deal

940

by Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta

941
00:39:07,843 --> 00:39:09,931
who was then Florida U.S. Attorney,

942
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:14,265
amounting to 13 months in
county jail with work release?

943
00:39:14,265 --> 00:39:15,777
In a Swamp Watch last December,

944
00:39:15,777 --> 00:39:17,880
I called for Acosta's
resignation for his role

945
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,713
in this horrific abuse of justice.

946
00:39:22,083 --> 00:39:26,534
You helped cover up a
billionaire's pedophile sex crimes

947
00:39:26,534 --> 00:39:28,536
on an epic scale.

948
00:39:28,536 --> 00:39:31,272
Now you're in President Trump's cabinet,

949
00:39:31,272 --> 00:39:36,272
and I think you owe all of us
an explanation and an apology.

950
00:39:36,628 --> 00:39:41,265
And if you can't do that,
it's time for you to go.

951
00:39:41,265 --> 00:39:43,294
Well the skeleton in
Acosta's closet is back

952
00:39:43,294 --> 00:39:45,584
in the public eye following
Epstein's arrest this weekend

953
00:39:45,584 --> 00:39:47,745
on charges of sex trafficking.

954
00:39:47,745 --> 00:39:51,982
So will we finally see some
accountability from Alex Acosta?

955
00:39:51,982 --> 00:39:55,649
In my view, it really
is time for him to go.

956
00:39:56,970 --> 00:40:00,220
Look, I think what drives people crazy,

957
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,430
in this case and in so
many others, Katrina,

958
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:06,137
is this sense that people
just do things in their past,

959
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:09,507
life moves on, it's the swamp,
there's no accountability,

960
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:14,286
no one's actually held responsible
for things that they did.

961
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:17,096
- Well look, I think,
specifically for this case,

962
00:40:17,096 --> 00:40:19,472
you literally have to go back to 2002

963
00:40:19,472 --> 00:40:23,072
to really grasp the bizarre circumstances

964
00:40:23,072 --> 00:40:25,346
that have surrounded this
case and the people around it.

965
00:40:25,346 --> 00:40:28,166
And it is quite disturbing when you look

966
00:40:28,166 --> 00:40:32,158
at all of the allegations,
dozens of women, young girls,

967
00:40:32,158 --> 00:40:34,517
which I have a zero tolerance policy for,

968
00:40:34,517 --> 00:40:35,988
and I think at this point,

969
00:40:35,988 --> 00:40:38,989
if you are the story, that's a problem.

970
00:40:38,989 --> 00:40:40,739
And I think that's where we are today,

971
00:40:40,739 --> 00:40:43,176
given the new arrest,
and we'll know tomorrow

972
00:40:43,176 --> 00:40:46,084
when we see what the actual charges are,

973
00:40:46,084 --> 00:40:47,479
if these indeed are new.

974
00:40:47,479 --> 00:40:50,649
There are reports that
these are new charges,

975
00:40:50,649 --> 00:40:52,863
new allegations from recent people.

976
00:40:52,863 --> 00:40:56,625
And if that turns out to
be true, then we probably

977
00:40:56,625 --> 00:40:58,929
should look at making
some significant changes,

978
00:40:58,929 --> 00:41:02,270
if this turns out to be
what it's said to be.

979
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:03,103
- [Steve] What do you make of it?

980
00:41:03,103 --> 00:41:04,976
- I think the Chief of Staff,

981
00:41:04,976 --> 00:41:06,792
the acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney,

982
00:41:06,792 --> 00:41:08,577
has probably had some serious discussions

983
00:41:08,577 --> 00:41:10,104
with the Labor Secretary.

984
00:41:10,104 --> 00:41:12,580
Serving in the president's
cabinet is a privilege,

985
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,961
it is not a right.

986
00:41:13,961 --> 00:41:15,847
Every time I've seen
Donald Trump in action,

987
00:41:15,847 --> 00:41:17,937
when there has been a flare up,
and there has been something

988
00:41:17,937 --> 00:41:19,924
where somebody has gone over the line,

989
00:41:19,924 --> 00:41:21,624
the president has taken care of this.

990
00:41:21,624 --> 00:41:23,624
I would be surprised in this case

991
00:41:23,624 --> 00:41:26,635
if the president allowed
it to continue and fester.

992
00:41:26,635 --> 00:41:30,552
He's taking some op eds
and some serious concern

993
00:41:30,552 --> 00:41:33,043
from people that are big
fans of the president.

994
00:41:33,043 --> 00:41:34,596
I don't see why this person,

995
00:41:34,596 --> 00:41:36,456
or how this person can continue on.

996
00:41:36,456 --> 00:41:37,809
And I think you were ahead of your time

997
00:41:37,809 --> 00:41:39,696
by calling it out in December,

998
00:41:39,696 --> 00:41:43,395
and it's exacerbated
by what's going on now.

999
00:41:43,395 --> 00:41:45,542
- We should be clear, it's
not anything he's done

1000
00:41:45,542 --> 00:41:48,019
since President Trump
appointed him, this is,

1001
00:41:48,019 --> 00:41:49,833
as you said, long time ago.

1002
00:41:49,833 --> 00:41:51,878
But there's something about
it, it's so egregious,

1003
00:41:51,878 --> 00:41:54,397
it's so revolting, you just think come on.

1004
00:41:54,397 --> 00:41:56,385
- Well there, you have to deal with it.

1005
00:41:56,385 --> 00:42:00,054
And when you continue to
make yourself the issue

1006
00:42:00,054 --> 00:42:02,088
and distract from the president's agenda,

1007
00:42:02,088 --> 00:42:03,960
you no longer need to be serving there.

1008
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,587
And this is not going to go away,

1009
00:42:05,587 --> 00:42:07,587
this case is gonna continue on.

1010
00:42:07,587 --> 00:42:10,526
And the coziness and the relationship,

1011
00:42:10,526 --> 00:42:13,089
I think the more people
look at how this guy,

1012
00:42:13,089 --> 00:42:15,739
the Labor Secretary,
dealt with it back then

1013
00:42:15,739 --> 00:42:17,640
is really bad stuff.

1014
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,468
- Well you know the argument
they're making is that

1015
00:42:19,468 --> 00:42:21,240
even through his confirmation hearing,

1016
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,788
there were U.S. Attorney Generals who,

1017
00:42:23,788 --> 00:42:25,099
U.S. Attorneys who looked at this

1018
00:42:25,099 --> 00:42:26,999
over three different administrations,

1019
00:42:26,999 --> 00:42:29,304
so there was something maybe we don't know

1020
00:42:29,304 --> 00:42:31,348
that was going on at that point in time,

1021
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:33,608
and the government does
what the government does,

1022
00:42:33,608 --> 00:42:35,668
and we don't always know why.

1023
00:42:35,668 --> 00:42:38,042
But I do think that now, if true,

1024
00:42:38,042 --> 00:42:41,760
that these allegations are new and recent,

1025
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,819
then all of those things
are gonna be opened.

1026
00:42:43,819 --> 00:42:47,044
And at that point, either
he should say something,

1027
00:42:47,044 --> 00:42:49,606
or step aside so this can play out.

1028
00:42:49,606 --> 00:42:51,465
- And remember, the Labor
Secretary is the one

1029
00:42:51,465 --> 00:42:54,288
that's supposed to
oversee human trafficking.

1030
00:42:54,288 --> 00:42:58,132
So it just gets even
worse because of the fact

1031
00:42:58,132 --> 00:42:59,443
that that's his job,

1032
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:01,387
is supposed to be overseeing
human trafficking,

1033
00:43:01,387 --> 00:43:03,689
and his record on human trafficking,

1034
00:43:03,689 --> 00:43:06,289
just based on this one
case alone, is horrific.

1035
00:43:06,289 --> 00:43:08,080
- Just to sort of wrap that up,

1036
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:13,080
this guy Epstein, you know
the real villain of the peace,

1037
00:43:13,153 --> 00:43:15,918
for years it seems he's
gotten away with it,

1038
00:43:15,918 --> 00:43:18,810
and looks like finally
now in this administration

1039
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:21,318
he might be getting the
justice he deserves.

1040
00:43:21,318 --> 00:43:24,671
All right, coming up,
after this past week,

1041
00:43:24,671 --> 00:43:28,906
it's clear the loonies have
taken over the Democrat party,

1042
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:30,490
Loony Left is next.

1043
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:33,073
(upbeat music)

1044
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:37,300
- Last year the internet told
IHOP to stick to pancakes.

1045
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,326
Well here they are,

pancakes with all
natural Black Angus beef.

1048
00:43:42,728 --> 00:43:44,156
Isn't that right, Mister Pancake?

1049
00:43:44,156 --> 00:43:45,697
- [Sing Song Voice] It's a pancake.

1050
00:43:45,697 --> 00:43:46,847
- But that's a bur.

00:44:04,494 --> 00:44:05,586
- [Narrator] Occasional bladder leakage?

1057
00:44:05,586 --> 00:44:07,546
- I've had it.

1058
00:44:07,546 --> 00:44:09,100
- I've had it.

1059
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,917
- [Narrator] Had it with bladder leakage?

- It's my ball Myrtlebeck.

1088

- I am so dead.

1089

1104
00:45:37,529 --> 00:45:39,070
- [Narrator] Loyalty, pass it on.

1105
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:41,144
- [Girl] You go first.

1106
00:45:41,144 --> 00:45:41,977
- [Narrator] A message from

1107
00:45:41,977 --> 00:45:44,196
the Foundation for a Better Life.

1108
00:45:44,196 --> 00:45:45,937
- Frank!
- Frank, over here!

1109
00:45:45,937 --> 00:45:47,584
(shutters click)
- Frank, Frank!

1110
00:45:47,584 --> 00:45:48,950
So Frank, you're the Big Hurt.

1111
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:50,030
Why do you need Nugenix?

1112
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:53,613
- After 40, a guy loses
free testosterone, even me.

1113
00:45:53,613 --> 00:45:55,243
I couldn't stay in shape like I used to.

1114
00:45:55,243 --> 00:45:56,467
- Frank!
- Frank!

1115
00:45:56,467 --> 00:45:57,792
- So does Nugenix really work?

1116
00:45:57,792 --> 00:45:59,144
- Yes, it's the number one selling

1117
00:45:59,144 --> 00:46:01,449
free testosterone booster at GNC.

1118
00:46:01,449 --> 00:46:03,521
- Okay great, but does it work for you?

1119
00:46:03,521 --> 00:46:05,910
- Oh yeah, my workouts are incredible now.

1120
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:09,254
I'm feeling stronger, more
energetic, with a lot more drive.

1121
00:46:09,254 --> 00:46:10,723
(reporters shout over each other)

1122
00:46:10,723 --> 00:46:13,374
- So say I knew someone
who should try Nugenix.

1123
00:46:13,374 --> 00:46:15,160
How does he do that?

1124
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:18,069
- It's easy, just send a text
to get a complimentary bottle.

1125
00:46:18,069 --> 00:46:19,969
- [Announcer] Frank's
right, now you can claim

1126
00:46:19,969 --> 00:46:22,223
a complimentary bottle
of award-winning Nugenix

1127
00:46:22,223 --> 00:46:24,773
by texting NEW to 321321.

1128
00:46:24,773 --> 00:46:28,026
Its unique man-boosting
formula is powered by Testofen,

1129
00:46:28,026 --> 00:46:30,029
a patented key ingredient
clinically researched

1130
00:46:30,029 --> 00:46:32,177
to help a man feel stronger, leaner,

1131
00:46:32,177 --> 00:46:34,221
more energetic, and more passionate.

1132
00:46:34,221 --> 00:46:36,857
- And trust me, you'll
like the difference too.

1133
00:46:36,857 --> 00:46:38,585
- [Announcer] Samples are
not available in stores,

1134
00:46:38,585 --> 00:46:41,853

1135
00:46:41,853 --> 00:46:44,445

1136
00:46:44,445 --> 00:46:47,023
(upbeat music)

1137
00:46:47,023 --> 00:46:51,523
- This is not 2016, this is
2020, and people are woke.

1138
00:46:54,281 --> 00:46:56,309
- You can say that again.

1139
00:46:56,309 --> 00:47:01,309
The entire Democratic party
is this week's Loony Left.

1140
00:47:01,377 --> 00:47:04,294
(mysterious music)

1141
00:47:09,069 --> 00:47:11,640
When Kamala Harris
says, "People are woke,"

1142
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:14,109
she seems to be talking
about her fellow candidates.

1143
00:47:14,109 --> 00:47:16,297
The mainstream Democrat positions now look

1144
00:47:16,297 --> 00:47:18,541
like they are open borders,

1145
00:47:18,541 --> 00:47:20,316
free healthcare for illegal immigrants,

1146
00:47:20,316 --> 00:47:22,749
abolition of private healthcare
for American citizens,

1147
00:47:22,749 --> 00:47:26,505
His-pandering, trans-pandering,
woke-pandering.

1148
00:47:26,505 --> 00:47:29,906
Yes, it's official, the Loony
Left is no longer the fringe,

1149
00:47:29,906 --> 00:47:33,156
it has taken over the Democratic Party.

1150
00:47:35,234 --> 00:47:38,388
- I mean look, I mean
this is just laughable.

1151
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:41,196
I mean when you see
someone like Kamala Harris

1152
00:47:41,196 --> 00:47:43,428
pandering to black people,
you know there's a problem.

1153
00:47:43,428 --> 00:47:46,250
And look, there is
actually a nickname for her

1154
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:48,295
with my black friends and online,

1155
00:47:48,295 --> 00:47:50,138
you see actual African Americans

1156
00:47:50,138 --> 00:47:53,940
that call her Chameleon Harris
because she is pandering.

1157
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:55,509
And the only people that are woke now

1158
00:47:55,509 --> 00:47:57,825
because of her candidacy
are the black people

1159
00:47:57,825 --> 00:47:59,729
who are actually descendants from slaves

1160
00:47:59,729 --> 00:48:02,103
because there's been this whole uproar

1161
00:48:02,103 --> 00:48:03,761
because she's presenting herself,

1162
00:48:03,761 --> 00:48:06,007
and the media's presenting
herself as African American.

1163
00:48:06,007 --> 00:48:09,088
She's an Islander American and
she should be proud of that.

1164
00:48:09,088 --> 00:48:10,212
But that's not what's happening.

1165
00:48:10,212 --> 00:48:12,487
She's given in to what you just discussed,

1166
00:48:12,487 --> 00:48:14,834
all of the His-pandering,
the trans-pandering,

1167
00:48:14,834 --> 00:48:16,821
and now she's trying to really beef up

1168
00:48:16,821 --> 00:48:19,442
her African American credential by using,

1169
00:48:19,442 --> 00:48:20,925
I guess, I don't know, woke.

1170
00:48:20,925 --> 00:48:21,802
- I mean it's just ridiculous.

1171
00:48:21,802 --> 00:48:25,219
I know he misspoke and has cleaned it up,

1172
00:48:27,233 --> 00:48:28,932
but for example Julian Castro going on

1173
00:48:28,932 --> 00:48:31,599
about abortions for trans women,

1174
00:48:32,733 --> 00:48:35,887
it's just one example,
just the endless pandering.

1175
00:48:35,887 --> 00:48:38,191
- Reproductive justice.

1176
00:48:38,191 --> 00:48:40,492
- And then you've got the policy shifts,

1177
00:48:40,492 --> 00:48:42,367
where they all put their
hand up for these positions

1178
00:48:42,367 --> 00:48:47,367
that are so extreme, compared
to just a couple of years ago.

1179
00:48:47,868 --> 00:48:50,805
- Well and just recently the
Democrats have just shown

1180
00:48:50,805 --> 00:48:53,628
that they have a distaste
and they don't like the flag,

1181
00:48:53,628 --> 00:48:56,045
they don't like the Fourth
of July celebration,

1182
00:48:56,045 --> 00:48:58,625
they're embarrassed by anybody who wants

1183
00:48:58,625 --> 00:49:01,173
to stand up and wrap
themselves in the flag,

1184
00:49:01,173 --> 00:49:03,377
and they put themselves
in a terrible position.

1185
00:49:03,377 --> 00:49:06,026
But I think that's when
your focus is on pandering

1186
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:09,295
and just winning, as opposed
to having a principle,

1187
00:49:09,295 --> 00:49:11,527
and staking that principle in the ground.

1188
00:49:11,527 --> 00:49:13,817
When you're rudder-less,
this is what happens,

1189
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:17,085
you start meandering wherever
the news of the day goes,

1190
00:49:17,085 --> 00:49:18,525
and the next thing you know you're left

1191
00:49:18,525 --> 00:49:22,759
with appeasing a very, very
small percentage of Americans,

1192
00:49:22,759 --> 00:49:25,668
and you're leaving 80% of the country,

1193
00:49:25,668 --> 00:49:27,497
who loves the country, behind.

1194
00:49:27,497 --> 00:49:28,519
- And what are they think this is,

1195
00:49:28,519 --> 00:49:32,016
I mean do they think they can
just kind of change all this

1196
00:49:32,016 --> 00:49:33,674
when it comes to the general election,

1197
00:49:33,674 --> 00:49:35,560
once they've finished
with their pandering,

1198
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,865
and whoever the nominee is gets elected,

1199
00:49:37,865 --> 00:49:40,903
they can just sort of
ditch all this, or what?

1200
00:49:40,903 --> 00:49:42,228
- Well I mean that's the plan,

1201
00:49:42,228 --> 00:49:44,057
the plan is to win the primary.

1202
00:49:44,057 --> 00:49:45,900
And you have the furthest of the left,

1203
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,999
the ones that are actually
falling of the cliff,

1204
00:49:47,999 --> 00:49:51,026
these are the people that the
Democrats are pandering to

1205
00:49:51,026 --> 00:49:53,719
with all of the isms that are out there.

1206
00:49:53,719 --> 00:49:55,073
As ridiculous as it sounds,

1207
00:49:55,073 --> 00:49:57,953
they do believe this is
some sort of strategy

1208
00:49:57,953 --> 00:50:00,342
because what we've seen is I don't think

1209
00:50:00,342 --> 00:50:03,324
they have any intention
on moving to the center,

1210
00:50:03,324 --> 00:50:05,412
even after the general election because

1211
00:50:05,412 --> 00:50:06,607
they're not going to move.
- That's the interesting

1212
00:50:06,607 --> 00:50:08,274
question is this is,

1213
00:50:09,165 --> 00:50:12,369
as you might say it's worse
than that, they really mean it.

1214
00:50:12,369 --> 00:50:13,852
- They mean it.
(laughing)

1215
00:50:13,852 --> 00:50:15,781
- Exactly, and this Trump
derangement syndrome,

1216
00:50:15,781 --> 00:50:17,265
I think is very real.
- It's very real.

1217
00:50:17,265 --> 00:50:18,761
- Because if Donald Trump likes the flag,

1218
00:50:18,761 --> 00:50:19,641
they don't like it.

1219
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:21,196
If he is wanting to protect the border,

1220
00:50:21,196 --> 00:50:22,434
then they want open borders.

1221
00:50:22,434 --> 00:50:23,701
It doesn't mean,

1222
00:50:23,701 --> 00:50:24,724
doesn't seem to matter.
- It's interesting though,

1223
00:50:24,724 --> 00:50:26,178
I wanna focus on the open borders thing

1224
00:50:26,178 --> 00:50:28,367
because that one really
interests me particularly,

1225
00:50:28,367 --> 00:50:31,261
because they hate that label.

1226
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:32,716
They always say, "We're
not for open borders,"

1227
00:50:32,716 --> 00:50:35,206
but it's fascinating to see,
over the last couple of weeks,

1228
00:50:35,206 --> 00:50:38,548
since that debate, you've
had so many commentators,

1229
00:50:38,548 --> 00:50:42,507
actually a lot of them real
Trump-hating columnists

1230
00:50:42,507 --> 00:50:45,877
and so on, and today, I think yesterday,

1231
00:50:45,877 --> 00:50:48,354
Jay Johnson Obama's
Homeland Security Secretary,

1232
00:50:48,354 --> 00:50:50,269
all saying some version

1233
00:50:50,269 --> 00:50:52,804
of they are effectively open borders,

1234
00:50:52,804 --> 00:50:54,359
they are functionally open borders.

1235
00:50:54,359 --> 00:50:57,555
You know, critics of Donald
Trump basically saying

1236
00:50:57,555 --> 00:51:00,607
this really is the official position now

1237
00:51:00,607 --> 00:51:02,841
of the Democratic Party, open borders.

1238
00:51:02,841 --> 00:51:04,238
- Well it is, I mean to the point

1239
00:51:04,238 --> 00:51:07,017
to where they don't even wanna fund ICE.

1240
00:51:07,017 --> 00:51:08,800
They don't even want
to protect the interior

1241
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,488
from the open borders that they want.

1242
00:51:12,488 --> 00:51:14,591
They are definitely
supportive of open borders,

1243
00:51:14,591 --> 00:51:16,738
mainly because, again they need the votes,

1244
00:51:16,738 --> 00:51:18,624
but when you have people like AOC

1245
00:51:18,624 --> 00:51:20,236
and all of the new Democrats out there

1246
00:51:20,236 --> 00:51:22,642
that are pushing these kinds of policies,

1247
00:51:22,642 --> 00:51:25,162
it really makes them look even more loony

1248
00:51:25,162 --> 00:51:27,710
than they really are,
but they do believe it.

1249
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:29,971
And I mean, and the thing about it is

1250
00:51:29,971 --> 00:51:31,267
when you're going into 2020,

1251
00:51:31,267 --> 00:51:33,485
I think that the position is very clear,

1252
00:51:33,485 --> 00:51:34,650
the voters are gonna have a choice.

1253
00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:37,157
You're either gonna vote for America,

1254
00:51:37,157 --> 00:51:39,158
or you're gonna vote for a Democrat,

1255
00:51:39,158 --> 00:51:42,067
and you can't get any more
clear than that at this point.

1256
00:51:42,067 --> 00:51:45,005
- Remember, AOC and the
whole lot of the Democrats

1257
00:51:45,005 --> 00:51:46,848
were saying there's no
crisis at the border,

1258
00:51:46,848 --> 00:51:49,379
there's no crisis, it's just fiction.

1259
00:51:49,379 --> 00:51:50,762
And now they're yelling and screaming

1260
00:51:50,762 --> 00:51:52,420
because there isn't enough money

1261
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:53,658
to take care of these people,

1262
00:51:53,658 --> 00:51:57,056
well you voted against it, and
you wouldn't support the idea

1263
00:51:57,056 --> 00:51:59,387
that they need money at HHS

1264
00:51:59,387 --> 00:52:00,728
and Border Patrol
- Oh it's so ridiculous.

1265
00:52:00,728 --> 00:52:03,103
- to take care of 'em.
- It's so hypocritical.

1266
00:52:03,103 --> 00:52:06,805
Anyway, whatever, there's
more fun to be had

00:55:29,148 --> 00:55:31,913
we've picked some highlights for you.

1348
00:55:31,913 --> 00:55:34,016
Here is the former vice president talking

1349
00:55:34,016 --> 00:55:37,849
about world leaders and
how he'd handled them.

1350
00:55:39,026 --> 00:55:42,224
- I took on Putin in terms of Iraq,

1351
00:55:42,224 --> 00:55:46,083
I mean excuse me in terms of
what was going on in Ukraine.

1352
00:55:46,083 --> 00:55:48,387
I've taken on these
leaders around the world.

1353
00:55:48,387 --> 00:55:50,273
I'm the guy that's gone in and meant it.

1354
00:55:50,273 --> 00:55:52,690
I've taken on all these lead.

1355
00:55:53,529 --> 00:55:55,272
- Okay, I'm the guy, he went in there

1356
00:55:55,272 --> 00:55:57,792
and took on Putin over
Iraq, whatever it was.

1357
00:55:57,792 --> 00:55:59,115
So if you could make out anything

1358
00:55:59,115 --> 00:56:01,306
from that sort of rambling incoherence

1359
00:56:01,306 --> 00:56:03,350
it was that he stood up to,
but of course he didn't.

1360
00:56:03,350 --> 00:56:05,798
They basically did
nothing when Putin walked

1361
00:56:05,798 --> 00:56:07,282
into Crimea and Ukraine,

1362
00:56:07,282 --> 00:56:10,378
and it's President Trump that
has gotten tough with Russia.

1363
00:56:10,378 --> 00:56:12,106
And as for standing up to other countries,

1364
00:56:12,106 --> 00:56:13,877
China, I mean my goodness.

1365
00:56:13,877 --> 00:56:17,015
Joe Biden when he was vice
president went soft on China,

1366
00:56:17,015 --> 00:56:19,954
as we keep telling you,
because the government

1367
00:56:19,954 --> 00:56:22,963
put billions of dollars
into his son's businesses.

1368
00:56:22,963 --> 00:56:27,557
Anyway, if you thought that
was funny, just watch this.

1369
00:56:27,557 --> 00:56:31,068
- Come on man, come on man, come on.

1370
00:56:31,068 --> 00:56:33,791
Come here man, come on, come on man.

1371
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:35,865
Hey man, no deal mean.

1372
00:56:35,865 --> 00:56:38,399
I'd smack them in the mouth.

1373
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:41,625
- Okay, and then, honestly almost straight

1374
00:56:41,625 --> 00:56:43,598
after that he said this.

1375
00:56:43,598 --> 00:56:44,935
- I think the American people

1376
00:56:44,935 --> 00:56:48,102
want a president who has some dignity.

1377
00:56:49,833 --> 00:56:51,172
- Dignity.
(chuckling)

1378
00:56:51,172 --> 00:56:53,303
Come on man, I'm gonna
smack you in the mouth.

1379
00:56:53,303 --> 00:56:56,961
And he says we need a
president with dignity.

1380
00:56:56,961 --> 00:56:58,934
I mean it's just, I don't
know where to start.

1381
00:56:58,934 --> 00:57:01,583
- I don't know, I think Uncle
Joe might have taken a nap.

1382
00:57:01,583 --> 00:57:03,930
I think he was kinda
sleepy during the debate,

1383
00:57:03,930 --> 00:57:06,076
so now he's trying to find his way back.

1384
00:57:06,076 --> 00:57:08,970
I mean it was really
interesting when he said

1385
00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:12,210
that there wouldn't be
Russia meddling on my watch,

1386
00:57:12,210 --> 00:57:14,997
it kinda was your watch guy.
- Right!

1387
00:57:14,997 --> 00:57:17,900
- It was funny, you know
I kinda feel sorry for him

1388
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:20,608
at this point, I really do.
(laughing)

1389
00:57:20,608 --> 00:57:23,070
He actually bragged about
Obama entrusting him

1390
00:57:23,070 --> 00:57:26,022
with the power and authority for Ukraine.

1391
00:57:26,022 --> 00:57:28,873
And you've covered extensively
how that went down.

1392
00:57:28,873 --> 00:57:30,644
And so I do, I think I just feel sorry

1393
00:57:30,644 --> 00:57:32,300
for Uncle Joe at this point.

1394
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:35,656
- The facts are elusive to Joe Biden.

1395
00:57:35,656 --> 00:57:39,904
This is what happens when
you're elected in 1972.

1396
00:57:39,904 --> 00:57:42,020
He has literally been in that,

1397
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:44,482
in an elected office that long.

1398
00:57:44,482 --> 00:57:47,622
I think he is, I think
the Democrats smell blood

1399
00:57:47,622 --> 00:57:50,056
in the water, I don't
think he'll be the nominee.

1400
00:57:50,056 --> 00:57:51,924
I think they're circling hard,

1401
00:57:51,924 --> 00:57:54,030
and I think they just need
to let Joe keep talking

1402
00:57:54,030 --> 00:57:56,246
because he's gonna talk
himself right out of it.

1403
00:57:56,246 --> 00:57:58,622
There's a reason why he
failed multiple times before

1404
00:57:58,622 --> 00:58:00,064
to become the president.
- It's just brilliant.

1405
00:58:00,064 --> 00:58:03,475
- There's a reason why
his staffer had to step in

1406
00:58:03,475 --> 00:58:04,499
to end the interview

1407
00:58:04,499 --> 00:58:05,780
when your staffer
- Is that right?

1408
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:07,480
- has to step in,
- How about during the debate?

1409
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,533
- come on.
- How about during the debate

1410
00:58:08,533 --> 00:58:10,448
when you say, well I gotta catch an Uber,

1411
00:58:10,448 --> 00:58:11,281
or whatever it is that he was saying?

1412
00:58:11,281 --> 00:58:12,579
(laughing)
- Oh my time is up.

1413
00:58:12,579 --> 00:58:13,861
- It's so bad.
- It's pretty bad.

1414
00:58:13,861 --> 00:58:15,417
- You know the thing is it's
just, it makes me laugh,

1415
00:58:15,417 --> 00:58:17,766
so President Trump has said,
he doesn't give much away,

1416
00:58:17,766 --> 00:58:19,220
but he said, "Actually I'd like

1417
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:20,932
"to face Biden, 'cause he's so terrible."

1418
00:58:20,932 --> 00:58:23,120
And a lot oh he's playing
some double game or whatever.

1419
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:25,974
I don't think he is, I
think he really means it

1420
00:58:25,974 --> 00:58:28,062
because he's so terrible.

1421
00:58:28,062 --> 00:58:29,920
- Yeah, he is, I think it would be great

1422
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,771
to see President Trump debate Joe Biden

1423
00:58:32,771 --> 00:58:33,940
on stage.
- Oh yes.

1424
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:35,131
People would love.
- We could actually

1425
00:58:35,131 --> 00:58:38,832
charge admission for that one incident.

1426
00:58:38,832 --> 00:58:41,901
I think it would be quite
a scene for America.

1427
00:58:41,901 --> 00:58:46,062
But in all seriousness, Joe
Biden really should reconsider

1428
00:58:46,062 --> 00:58:48,698
what he's doing just for his own legacy,

1429
00:58:48,698 --> 00:58:50,901
mainly because of all of
the issues that he has.

1430
00:58:50,901 --> 00:58:55,089
To Jason's point, he's been
in politics for four decades,

1431
00:58:55,089 --> 00:58:57,122
so it's gonna be extremely
hard to constantly

1432
00:58:57,122 --> 00:58:59,033
defend his position when every other week

1433
00:58:59,033 --> 00:59:01,499
he's gonna have to
apologize for that position,

1434
00:59:01,499 --> 00:59:04,017
just because all of
the 30 other contenders

1435
00:59:04,017 --> 00:59:04,970
are gonna call him out on it.
- That's right, he should be,

1436
00:59:04,970 --> 00:59:06,194
like we were talking
about with Loony Left,

1437
00:59:06,194 --> 00:59:08,079
he's just being pushed to
the left the whole time.

1438
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:08,913
Last word, Jason.

1439
00:59:08,913 --> 00:59:11,205
- No, Democrats are gonna select somebody,

1440
00:59:11,205 --> 00:59:13,250
but the path to get there
is gonna be a hard one.

1441
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:15,294
But if Donald Trump
keeps playing his A game,

1442
00:59:15,294 --> 00:59:18,506
he will be reelected I have no doubt.

1443
00:59:18,506 --> 00:59:21,282
I think he's stronger politically
today than he's ever been.

1444
00:59:21,282 --> 00:59:23,387
- When you see these candidates,

1445
00:59:23,387 --> 00:59:26,843
and not just their performance
as with Biden there,

1446
00:59:26,843 --> 00:59:30,141
but the policy, in the
end, President Trump won

1447
00:59:30,141 --> 00:59:32,589
not just because he was
so strong as a campaigner,

1448
00:59:32,589 --> 00:59:34,317
but it was policy, it was the issues

1449
00:59:34,317 --> 00:59:36,045
and the arguments he made.

1450
00:59:36,045 --> 00:59:38,246
And when you see the
arguments that are coming

1451
00:59:38,246 --> 00:59:40,509
from the other side, well.

1452
00:59:40,509 --> 00:59:42,133
All right, that's all for tonight.

1453
00:59:42,133 --> 00:59:45,174
