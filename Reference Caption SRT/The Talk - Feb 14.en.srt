Thursday, February 14th,

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,690
Valentine's Day, and The Talk is live.

9
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,610
Empire star, Jussie Smollett,
speaks out for the first time

10
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,230
since his attack last month.

11
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,630
He tells Robin Roberts he's not just angry

12
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:33,790
at the men who beat him,

13
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:37,310
he's also outraged at the
skeptics who doubt his story.

14
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:38,700
Desperate for fame and likes,

15
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,220
a wannabe Instagram
influencer posts herself

16
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,778
throwing a chair off a
building's 45th floor balcony.

17
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:47,510
Is your sex drive in
sync with your partner's?

18
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,840
One company claims it's
found a way to make sure

19
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,220
you're both in the mood
with no risk of rejection.

20
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,430
Justin Bieber is reportedly being treated

21
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,240
for deep depression issues.

Find out how his wife,
Hailey, is helping him

23
00:00:59,287 --> 00:01:01,500
and what they are putting on hold.

24
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,200
Then our neighborhood is about
to get a whole lot funnier

25
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,370
thanks to the stars of the hit
CBS show "The Neighborhood".

26
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,610
Cedric The Entertainer and
Tichina Arnold are here.

27
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,725
So let's start talking.

28
00:01:12,725 --> 00:01:16,445
♪ We can talk it, we can talk it out ♪

29
00:01:16,445 --> 00:01:18,037
♪ So what you got what you got ♪

30
00:01:18,037 --> 00:01:20,786
♪ What you got now ♪

00:01:22,007 --> 00:01:25,257
♪ So let's talk it out ♪

33
00:01:43,496 --> 00:01:46,506
- Hello and welcome to The Talk.

34
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:49,357
Happy Valentine's Day, everybody.

35
00:01:49,357 --> 00:01:51,607
(cheering)

36
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,546
Let's get started with Empire.

37
00:01:55,546 --> 00:01:56,887
- [Audience Member] Happy Valentine's Day!

38
00:01:56,887 --> 00:01:59,960
- Happy Valentine's Day.
- Happy Valentine's Day.

39
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,658
- All right, let's get
started with Empire star

40
00:02:02,658 --> 00:02:05,450
Jussie Smollett, speaking
out for the first time

41
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,580
after his attack.

42
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,700
It's been two and a
half weeks since Jussie

43
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,470
said he was attacked in Chicago by two men

44
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:14,080
who yelled racial and homophobic slurs,

45
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,700
punched him, wrapped a
rope around his neck,

46
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,310
and then doused him with bleach.

47
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,920
Because police said
Jussie initially refused

48
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,490
to turn over his phone records

49
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,470
and that the ones he
did eventually give them

50
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,350
were heavily edited and redacted,

51
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:29,050
some people have accused
the Empire star of lying.

52
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,940
Today Jussie sat down
with GMA's Robin Roberts

53
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,818
to set the record straight.

54
00:02:33,818 --> 00:02:35,500
- I'm pissed off.

55
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,540
- What is it that has you so angry?

56
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,280
Is it the attackers?

57
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,810
- It's the attackers, but
it's also the attacks.

58
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,270
Wanting me to give my phone to the tech

59
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,790
for three to four hours.

60
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,540
I'm sorry but

61
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,500
I'm not going to do that.
- Why?

62
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,500
- Because I have private
pictures and videos and numbers.

63
00:03:00,527 --> 00:03:03,773
My partner's number, my family's number,

64
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:07,440
my castmates' number, my friends' numbers,

65
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,816
my private emails, my private
songs, my private voice memos.

66
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:14,003
I don't know what that's gonna
be to hand over my phone.

67
00:03:16,386 --> 00:03:17,219
(clapping)

68
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:20,020
- While Chicago Police have
screened lots of footage

69
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,580
from neighborhood security cameras,

70
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,110
they still have not found
video of the actual attack.

71
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,258
Jussie shared his frustration.

72
00:03:26,258 --> 00:03:29,218
- I want that video found so badly

73
00:03:29,218 --> 00:03:32,746
because for probably four reasons.

74
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:35,058
Number one, I want them to
find the people that did it.

75
00:03:35,058 --> 00:03:37,650
Number two, I want them to stop

76
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,466
being able to say alleged attack.

77
00:03:39,466 --> 00:03:42,893
Number three, I want them
to see that I fought back,

78
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,350
and I want a little gay
boy who might watch this

79
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:50,190
to see that I fought the (beeping) back.

80
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,290
It does not take anything away from people

81
00:03:53,357 --> 00:03:55,170
that are not able to do
that, but I fought back.

82
00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:00,126
They ran off, I didn't.
(audience applauds)

83
00:04:00,126 --> 00:04:04,340
- And we have this new
update from Chicago Police

84
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,310
who announced they are questioning

85
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:10,250
two persons of interest in
connection with Jussie's attack.

86
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,060
Police stress neither person
has been charged with a crime,

87
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,760
and as of now, there is no
evidence they were involved.

88
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,250
So do you think speaking
out is the best way

89
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,740
to shut down skeptics?

90
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,096
- [Audience] Yes!

91
00:04:21,096 --> 00:04:25,817
- Oh absolutely, and I've
got to side with Jussie

92
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,423
on the thing that I don't
want my phone to be looked at.

93
00:04:31,567 --> 00:04:36,438
All my nude shots and things.
(audience laughs)

94
00:04:36,438 --> 00:04:39,368
- More specific--
- Yes!

95
00:04:39,368 --> 00:04:43,147
(cheering)
Hours and hours.

96
00:04:43,147 --> 00:04:46,940
Hours and hours of
sexual footage of myself.

97
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:51,940
I wouldn't want my phone to
be taken away and analyzed.

98
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,570
I just wouldn't want it.

99
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:57,660
Not for anything other than
it's my personal life on there,

100
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,780
and I just wouldn't want it,
so I totally get that with him.

101
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:06,780
And I totally get that he
might have deleted some things.

102
00:05:06,986 --> 00:05:10,906
It's hard, he's been
through a really tough time.

103
00:05:10,906 --> 00:05:14,580
- Yeah, and the media has
really cast so much doubt

104
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,310
on his story, which I find
so personally offensive.

105
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,160
That a gay black man is targeted,

106
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,910
and then suddenly he becomes the victim

107
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:28,106
of people's disbelief.
(audience applauds)

108
00:05:28,106 --> 00:05:29,258
It's so outrageous to me.

109
00:05:29,258 --> 00:05:31,730
There have been things like well

110
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:35,040
why would he be getting a
Subway sandwich at two a.m.

111
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,160
He said himself, well
they're open at that time

112
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,096
because people go; otherwise,
they wouldn't be open.

113
00:05:41,096 --> 00:05:43,679
- We go.
- I go.

114
00:05:43,679 --> 00:05:47,610
- Or people say in that neighborhood

115
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,270
you couldn't get a taxi.
Says who?

116
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:52,790
It's just like these
sort of ridiculous things

117
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:57,260
where I feel like why don't
we believe this person, why?

118
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,837
- It really is sad, and with
all that he has been through,

119
00:05:59,837 --> 00:06:02,546
the fact that he has to come out.

120
00:06:02,546 --> 00:06:05,590
But at the same time,
because of social media,

121
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:09,430
there are so many opinions,
it's better to hear it

122
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,930
from his own mouth and hear it from him

123
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,466
and feel his energy, and I'm glad

124
00:06:14,466 --> 00:06:16,680
with everything that has happened,

125
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,090
I am happy that he's
being brave enough to sit

126
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,800
with Robin Roberts and share his story.

127
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,780
- And if the naysayers know so much

128
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,310
about what they think happened,

129
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,650
why you don't know who did it?

130
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:29,810
- Exactly.
Since you know so much,

131
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:34,117
since you know so much,
just tell us what you know.

132
00:06:34,117 --> 00:06:37,690
I hate the fact that we
are in a social media.

133
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,410
Even the common person.

134
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:41,510
Usually it's the celebrity and their fans

135
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,370
and their followers.

136
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,440
Now it's even the common
person who may have something

137
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,010
happen to them that they're
going to their supporters

138
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,670
or whatever for acknowledgement.

139
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,460
That's why people don't want to talk.

140
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,120
That's why people don't
want to come forward.

141
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,530
Because they're gonna be judged.

142
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,910
And that doesn't help the situation.

143
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:02,910
- Well what I hope that the
police are on to something

144
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,660
with these two persons of interest.

145
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,220
I hope they get them, and
that people have to look at

146
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,096
how as a media and as
culture we twist things

147
00:07:11,096 --> 00:07:16,096
and cast doubt on things that
we should not cast doubt on.

148
00:07:16,962 --> 00:07:20,048
(audience applauds)

149
00:07:20,048 --> 00:07:22,410
- And hear them apologize,
will people apologize.

150
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,610
When the truth come
out, will you apologize?

151
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,058
As hard as you judged
him, will you apologize?

152
00:07:28,058 --> 00:07:31,818
(audience applauds)
- Hope so, but I doubt it.

153
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:35,750
- In other news, a 19-year-old
wannabe Instagram influencer

154
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,930
with less than 4,000 followers

155
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,610
threw two chairs off a 45th-story balcony

156
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,070
in Toronto over the weekend,

157
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,140
presumably to get more likes.

158

video of a woman tossing

161
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,790
a patio chair off the balcony
of a Toronto high rise

162
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:00,070
takes your breath away.
(woman gasps)

163
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,840
People are stunned as they
see it for the first time.

164
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,477
- It's ridiculous, why risk peoples' lives

165
00:08:05,477 --> 00:08:08,740
for a moment of just
Internet fame essentially?

166
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,720
- [News Anchor] Below that balcony,

167
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,010
the Gardiner Expressway
and lots of foot traffic.

168
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:16,230
Police think it was two chairs,
found crumpled in a heap

169
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,630
at the base of the building.

170
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,760
- She has been charged
with endangering life

171
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,640
and has now been released on $1,500 bail

172
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,250
and ordered to live with her mother.

173
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,950
So do you think all social media platforms

174
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,338
should ban her for life?

175
00:08:33,338 --> 00:08:34,755
- [Audience] Yes!

176
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:41,128
- Oh yeah, I mean here
is a perfect example

177
00:08:41,128 --> 00:08:45,723
of a young person who wants instant fame,

178
00:08:47,618 --> 00:08:50,760
the recognition, everything
that comes with it,

179
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,760
for nothing except being
stupid, ignorant, no talent.

180
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:02,730
Why would you, 45, I can't even believe

181
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,980
that the window opened on the 45th floor,

182
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,760
but, however, it did, and her chucking.

183
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,290
Can you imagine if that had hit a car

184
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:14,280
and that car would have
crashed into another car

185
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,857
and another and another?

186
00:09:15,857 --> 00:09:19,269
I mean, the thought of
it just makes you shiver.

187
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:23,550
It's just ridiculous that
these wannabe kids out there

188
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:26,290
think overnight they're
going to get fame and fortune

189
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:28,387
for being pathetic.

190
00:09:28,387 --> 00:09:31,835
You are a pathetic young girl.
(audience applauds)

191

She wants to be an influencer.

192

Well why don't you work on your writing.

193
00:09:37,629 --> 00:09:41,130
You want to influence
people, work on something.

194
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,680
You don't get something
worth having overnight

195
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,509
by being ridiculously ignorant as you are.

196
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:50,880
- It's sad.
- Yeah, and it's over likes.

we were getting married,

208
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,928
I was doing a bridesmaid's
hangout in my room.

209
00:10:17,928 --> 00:10:20,258
When we opened my room to come in,

210
00:10:20,258 --> 00:10:23,430
there was a lane of flowers all the way

211

with about 18 or 19 gifts
with little notes on each one,

212
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,930
like I will protect you, I
will always keep you safe.

213
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,800
It was just like, everyone was crying.

214

219
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,480
- For me, my husband is the
king at romantic gestures.

220
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,093
He's on his way to come see me right now.

221
00:10:55,133 --> 00:10:57,890
This morning I woke up, and he posted this

222
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:58,860
before his flight.

223
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,220
And I'm like it just melts my heart

Simply made with 100% olive oil.

315
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,565
Simply no sugar added.

316
00:15:55,565 --> 00:15:56,999
Simply dinner.

317
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:59,113
Simply delicious.

318
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,303
Ragu Simply.

319
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,750
- [Announcer] Tonight.
- Stronger together.

320
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:09,100
He stole Hillary
Clinton's campaign slogan.

321
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,919
It's only a matter of time
before he steals her look.

322
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:13,800
- Colbert's all new with Bradley Cooper.

323
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,080
- [Announcer] Melissa
McCarthy and the secret life

324
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,663
of George Washington, this Sunday morning.

325
00:16:20,348 --> 00:16:23,348
(audience applauds)

326
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:27,870
- Are you ever in the mood but
aren't sure your partner is?

327
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,400
An Ohio couple has come
up with a unique solution.

328
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,160
They call it LoveSync.

329
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,950
And they're raising money
for it on Kick Starter.

330
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,090
Take a look.

331
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,620
Love Sync is a device that lets you know

332
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,950
when both of you are in the
mood for some hippity-dippity.

333
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,170
- It's super simple.

334
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,960
All you have to do is place a button

335
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,720
at each of your bedsides.

336
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,542
And when you're feeling a little randy,

337
00:16:46,542 --> 00:16:47,980
you just anonymously push the button.

338
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,610
There is no risk of rejection.

339
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:53,620
If only one of you pushes
the button, nothing happens,

340
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,310
and your partner is none the wiser.

341
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:59,290
But, if your partner's also
ready for a pants off dance off,

342
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,731
they'll press their button.

343
00:17:00,731 --> 00:17:05,050
The Love Sync technology
combines these anonymous inputs

344
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:07,500
and recognizes that there is consensus.

345
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,360
It lets you both know by
emitting a swirling glow

346
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,633
from the buttons.

347
00:17:14,544 --> 00:17:17,377
(audience laughs)

348
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,720
- Serious question, do you
feel like you and your mate's

349
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,630
sex drives are in sync?

350
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,340
- Well first, the button is unnecessary.

351
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,030
Why don't you just poke me in the back

352
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,330
or tap me on the shoulder
like most people do?

353
00:17:32,186 --> 00:17:35,186
(audience applauds)

354
00:17:37,339 --> 00:17:41,040
I got enough gadgets in my nightstand.

355
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,290
I don't need this button.

356
00:17:45,662 --> 00:17:48,010
- I was just saying to the girls,

357
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:51,646
I think it's gonna be like
a joke gift to give out

358
00:17:51,646 --> 00:17:56,646
for birthday gifts or when
someone's getting married.

359
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,720
A silly little novelty gift.

360
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,830
I think it's gonna be like the pet rock.

361
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,171
Useless, but everybody got one.

362
00:18:03,171 --> 00:18:04,291
(audience laughs)

363
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,669
- I think it's kind of
cute for some reason.

364
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:09,170
I think it's kind of
cute, but I can also see

365
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:10,910
a fight between people like

366
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:14,883
I pushed my button!
(audience laughs)

367
00:18:17,517 --> 00:18:19,420
- There is no way for rejection,
but there is rejection.

368
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,980
- There is rejection.

369
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,890
- If the person doesn't
push the button back,

370
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:24,823
you feel some type of way, it's weird.

371
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:27,790
- Since Linda was just out here,

372
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,340
are you and Linda's sex drives in sync?

373
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,780
Would you tap your
buttons at the same time?

374
00:18:34,769 --> 00:18:39,019
- I'm not going to answer
those kinds of questions.

375
00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:42,810
- Here's the bigger story part.

376
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:45,030
So what if you're pressing the button,

377
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:47,432
but I'm asleep and I don't
see you pressing the button?

378
00:18:47,432 --> 00:18:50,515
Or what if the button gets jammed?

379
00:18:50,515 --> 00:18:52,765
(laughing)

380
00:18:53,965 --> 00:18:54,980
- Well, they're not that far away

381
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,337
that they can't unjam at you.

382
00:18:57,806 --> 00:19:01,056
- I'd rather use my batteries
for other things child.

383
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:04,056
(audience applauds)

384
00:19:07,601 --> 00:19:08,434
- There are people who are
more forthcoming than I am.

385
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,170
Have you guys ever had relationships

386
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:13,280
where you're in sync

387
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,333
or not in sync?

388
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,220
- I've had both, I've had both.

389
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,217
Me and Max are pretty good.

390
00:19:26,395 --> 00:19:27,853
- These are things on
your mind for later today.

391
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,073
The one that got away that I think about

392
00:19:31,073 --> 00:19:33,340
that was like my first
love when I was about 23,

393
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,590
our sex drives were absolutely in sync.

394
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,380
And I had a really good
girlfriend in Hawaii

395
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,223
once tell me, and her
relationship has been going on,

396
00:19:39,223 --> 00:19:41,070
I put all my energy towards my career,

397
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:43,480
but her, she's put all her
energy towards her like marriage

398
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,330
and her love life, and she
says that the sex drive

399
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,243
is the most important thing
because it's how you sort of

400
00:19:48,243 --> 00:19:51,200
keep coming back together,
that divine attraction

401
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,080
on all levels, right?

402
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,120
- I had a guy who was so out
of sync that I would stay up

403
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,710
all night just so I
didn't have to do nothing.

404
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:02,840
And then I would sleep all day.

405
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,690
I'd drink coffee.

406
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,470
- How long was this relationship?

407
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,950
- Every time this guy calls me,

408
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,939
and he normally calls
around Valentine's Day,

409
00:20:10,939 --> 00:20:13,457
you know I'm busy I can't.

410
00:20:13,457 --> 00:20:16,568
I never thought I would be
out of sync with this guy.

411
00:20:16,568 --> 00:20:17,700
- He's going to take his button

412
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,500
and just hit you over the head with it.

413
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:25,313
- We'll be right back.
(audience applauds)

414
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:28,486
- [Announcer] You know that look,

415
00:20:28,486 --> 00:20:31,070
that life of the party look?

416
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,770
Walk it off look.

417
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:34,380
One more mile look.

418
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,630
Reply all look.

419
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,890
Own your look with fewer lines.

420
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:39,920
There's only one Botox Cosmetic.

421
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,720
It's the only one FDA
approved to temporarily make

422
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,130
frown lines, crows feet, and
forehead lines look better.

423
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:48,057
The effects of Botox
Cosmetic may spread hours

424
00:20:48,057 --> 00:20:51,360
to weeks after injection,
causing serious symptoms.

425
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,060
Alert your doctor right away,
as difficulty swallowing,

426
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:56,730
speaking, breathing, eye
problems, or muscle weakness

427
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:58,880
may be a sign of a
life-threatening condition.

428
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,820
Do not receive Botox Cosmetic
if you have a skin infection.

429
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,103
Side effects may include
allergic reactions,

430
00:21:05,146 --> 00:21:06,730
injection site pain, headache,
eyebrow eyelid drooping,

431
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:07,860
and eyelid swelling.

432
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,640
Tell your doctor about
your medical history,

433
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,870
muscle or nerve conditions,
and medications,

434
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,410
including botulinum toxins,

435
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,960
as these may increase the
risk of serious side effects.

436
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,057
So give that just saw a puppy look

437
00:21:18,057 --> 00:21:20,350
and whatever that look is.

438
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,560
Look like you with fewer lines.

439
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,993
Own your look with the one
and only Botox Cosmetic.

440
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:34,360
- [Announcer] Those arms,
they'll be jelly tomorrow.

441
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,660
It'll hurt to sit and laugh

442
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:40,400
because that workout is working.

443
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,630
Feed it with Special K.

444
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:46,093
With iron, protein, and B vitamins.

445
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:53,610
Feed your progress, feed
your power, feed your change.

446
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:57,940
- [Announcer] I was thrilled to be able

447
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,350
to go with my friends to
our annual get-together,

448
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,820
especially after being diagnosed

449
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,940
last year with advanced
non-small cell lung cancer.

450
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,137
- [Announcer] Another
true story with Keytruda.

451
00:22:07,137 --> 00:22:10,750
- I started Katie on
Keytruda and chemotherapy,

452
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:14,120
and she's getting results we
rarely saw five years ago.

453
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,410
- [Announcer] In a clinical trial,

454
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:16,970
significantly more patients

455
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:19,550
lived longer and saw their tumors shrink

456
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:21,560
than on chemotherapy alone.

457
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,190
- It has changed my approach
to treating patients.

458
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:25,110
- [Announcer] Keytruda may be used

459
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,550
with certain chemotherapies
as your first treatment

460
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:30,800
if you have advanced non squamous
non-small cell lung cancer

461
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,900
and you do not have an
abnormal EGFR or ALK gene.

462
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,300
Keytruda helps your
immune system fight cancer

463
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,880
but can also cause your immune system

464
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,650
to attack healthy parts of your body.

465
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,600
This can happen during or after treatment

466
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,200
and may be severe and lead to death.

467
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,950
See your doctor right away if
you have new or worse cough,

468
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,220
chest pain, shortness of breath, diarrhea,

469
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:51,100
severe stomach pain or
tenderness, nausea or vomiting,

470
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,340
rapid heartbeat, increased
hunger or thirst,

471
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,470
constipation, dizziness or fainting,

472
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:57,000
changes in urine or eyesight,

473
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,740
muscle pain or weakness, joint pain,

474
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,270
confusion or memory problems,

475
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:02,290
fever, rash, itching, or flushing.

476
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,340
These are not all the
possible side effects.

477
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,560
Tell your doctor about all
your medical conditions,

478
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,140
including immune system problems,

479
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,720
if you've had an organ transplant,

480
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,780
had or plan to have a
stem cell transplant,

481
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:14,200
or have lung, breathing,
or liver problems.

482
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,953
- Where I am now, compared to a year ago,

483
00:23:15,953 --> 00:23:17,800
it's a story worth sharing.

484
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,710
- [Announcer] Living longer is possible.

485
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:22,000
It's true, Keytruda from Merck,

486
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,660
with more FDA-approved uses
for advanced lung cancer

487
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,383
than any other immunotherapy.

488
00:23:28,182 --> 00:23:31,280
(audience applauds)

489
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,960
- Justin Bieber is reportedly
putting his wedding plans

490
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,870
on hold because of his mental health.

491
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,430
Justin and his wife Hailey were married

492
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:39,690
in a secret civil ceremony last year

493
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:42,720
and had planned to say "I Do"
again in a religious service,

494
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,770
but those plans were delayed while Justin

495
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:46,920
seeks counseling for his depression.

496
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,680
A source tells People
Magazine that the 24-year-old

497
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,780
has felt overwhelmed by fame.

498
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:55,010
The source says "being
followed, having his every move

499
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:58,610
stalked by fans, cameras in
his face, it all sets him off,

500
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:01,182
and he often feels like
everyone is out to get him."

501
00:24:01,182 --> 00:24:03,620
Have you ever had to put something on hold

502
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,110
to focus on your mental health?

503
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,430
- [All] Yeah.

504
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:09,170
- I think that most of us have.

505
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:14,170
When life becomes, you lose
control of what's going on,

506
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,749
and you just think I can't do it, I can't.

507
00:24:15,749 --> 00:24:19,115
I need to take a breath.

508
00:24:19,115 --> 00:24:24,115
I feel badly for him because
I know that a lot of people

509
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:27,670
are probably saying, well
what's he depressed about?

510
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:30,570
He's got everything, he's got
this, that, and the other,

511
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:33,970
and it just doesn't work that
way with severe depression,

512
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:38,970
it really doesn't, and I feel
really bad for him right now.

513
00:24:40,023 --> 00:24:42,980
I am happy that he's
getting himself together,

514
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:47,041
his head together, his
priorities, he's got right.

515
00:24:47,041 --> 00:24:50,633
And I'm glad he's taking
a break for himself.

516
00:24:50,633 --> 00:24:51,971
(audience applauds)

517
00:24:51,971 --> 00:24:53,473
- There was a time once when I felt like,

518
00:24:53,473 --> 00:24:54,893
my father died right before a season

519
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:57,331
of Dancing with the Stars,
like four days before.

520
00:24:57,331 --> 00:25:00,280
As much as I felt myself
going into depression,

521
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,480
but I had to put it off.

522
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,690
Have you ever done this as well?

523
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:05,401
Where there's like a
time where I had to put

524
00:25:05,401 --> 00:25:06,530
like a steel wall between
me and my emotions

525
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:07,540
so I could get through the season

526
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,380
of Dancing with the Stars

527
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,530
and everything that was coming.

528
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:12,650
I had just broken up with
my fiance, my dad died,

529
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:15,230
I moved, I was diagnosed
with chronic illness.

530
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:18,033
It was one of those times that
I knew I didn't have time.

531
00:25:18,033 --> 00:25:20,970
What was important is you
shouldn't push off your emotions

532
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:23,600
unless you know you can
have a time to deal with it.

533
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,550
That's the part that was key.

534
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:26,270
I knew after the season was over,

535
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,570
I could spend like three months

536
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:29,250
just sort of taking care of myself,

537
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:30,591
and I was very fortunate to have that.

538
00:25:30,591 --> 00:25:32,960
I've had it almost the opposite.

539
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,540
- Did you feel during that
time that you were acting out

540
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:39,900
at all or having weird
emotions kind of sneak out?

541
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,510
- Yeah, they do sneak out,
because emotions are emotions.

542
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,640
They have their own template,

543
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,890
their own desires that come out,

544
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:46,560
and they will find a way out.

545
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,930
You can put them off for like.

546
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:49,740
Dancing with the Stars is
like 10 weeks out of the year.

547
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,930
So for 10 weeks I could
kind of put them on hold,

548
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:52,830
but they would sneak out.

549
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:53,803
I would watch Dance.

550
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:55,720
Andy Dick was on our show that year.

551
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,610
He danced something, I like lost it.

552
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:59,370
It was really simple,
it was my own emotions

553
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:00,720
with my own life coming up.

554
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:04,962
- But then what did you
do once you had that time?

555
00:26:04,962 --> 00:26:07,294
- I actually sought counseling.

556
00:26:07,294 --> 00:26:08,230
I love to read.

557
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,960
There are so many great
books that you can read.

558
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,384
I bought every book I could
possibly find on depression.

559
00:26:13,384 --> 00:26:16,200
I just went and sought my friends,

560
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,094
my support system, I was very lucky.

561
00:26:18,094 --> 00:26:22,370
We'll be right back.
(audience applauds)

562
00:26:23,923 --> 00:26:26,050
- Heavenly hand cream.

563
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,320
- Heavenly hand cream?

564
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,490
My hands get so dry and
cracked, I need serious relief.

565
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:32,340
That's why I use O'Keefe's Working Hands.

566
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,180
It's America's number
one selling hand cream.

567
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,270
For guaranteed relief of
dry and cracked hands.

568
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,800
Thanks to O'Keefe's, I got my hands back.

569
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,910

Tomorrow at Macy's.

602
00:27:53,314 --> 00:27:56,460
- [Announcer] So, there you
are with your depression.

603
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,890
And your dirty laundry

604
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:00,470
that you just don't want to deal with.

605
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,463
Because depression is multiple symptoms.

606
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:07,030
Yeah, time for a change.

607
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:09,490
And your doctor tells
you about Trintellix.

608
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:11,670
A prescription medicine for depression.

609
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:14,040
So you're feeling this overall relief

610
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,220
and Trintellix had no significant impact

611
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,020
on weight in clinical trials.

612
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,330
You got this.

613
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:20,430
Tell your doctor right away

614
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,760
if you have worsening depression,

615
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,480
unusual changes in mood, behavior,

616
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,580
or thoughts of suicide.

617
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,630
Antidepressants can
increase these in children,

618
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:27,650
teens, and young adults.

619
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:29,170
Do not take with MAOIs.

620
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:30,870
Tell your doctor about your medications,

621
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:33,580
including migraine, psychiatric,
and depression medications

622
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,830
to avoid a potentially
life-threatening condition.

623
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:38,040
Increased risk of bleeding
and bruising may occur,

624
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,130
especially if taken with
NSAID pain relievers,

625
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:41,350
aspirin, or blood thinners.

626
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:44,190
Manic episodes or vision problems
may occur in some people.

627
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,630
May cause low sodium levels.

628
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,810
Common side effects include

629
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:48,421

New CBS Monday, eight, seven central.

637
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:10,520
- They say...
- They say.

638
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,600
- They say in D.C.

639
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,230
- We just can't get things done.

640
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,063
- We say.

641
00:29:14,063 --> 00:29:15,930
- This is where idealists come together.

642
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:18,680
- And history inspires us to greatness.

643
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,680
- So what matters.

644
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,940
- What they say

645
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:21,923
- Or what's real?

646
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,680

right here, on WSA9.

675
00:30:31,195 --> 00:30:33,190
(audience applauds)

676
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:36,580
- With harsh winter storms
affecting nearly every part

677
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,413
of the country this week,

678
00:30:37,413 --> 00:30:39,970
snowball fights are a common occurrence,

679
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:42,190
but one Seattle woman got arrested

680
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:45,080
after she nearly ran
over a group of people

681
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,036
who allegedly threw snowballs at her car.

682
00:30:47,036 --> 00:30:50,236
The local CBS station has details.

683
00:30:50,236 --> 00:30:52,403
(yelling)

684
00:30:53,917 --> 00:30:57,080
- [News Anchor] Joey Wiser
shot this cellphone video

685
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,079
that's now gone viral.

686
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:01,850
(woman yelling)

687
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:04,800
- He told me he couldn't believe
the woman behind the wheel

688
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,190
of this blue Jeep would swerve past him

689
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:09,560
before running straight
into a group of people

690
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,990
across the street, narrowly missing them.

691
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:15,203
- It seems like her intention
was to run them over.

692
00:31:17,978 --> 00:31:20,260
- It was a neighborhood
snowball fight that went wrong.

693
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,520
- [News Anchor] Rocky Moran was
the person seen in the video

694
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,210
trying to hold the woman down.

695
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,970
He said that she got upset because her car

696
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,640
was hit by one of the snowballs.

697
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,690
The woman's car ended up
getting stuck in the snow.

698
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,860
Neighbors called police, and her arrest

699
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:36,060
was also caught on camera.

700
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,050
Authorities said the woman now
identified is facing charges

701
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:41,273
of DUI and reckless driving.

702
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,280
- Oh my gosh, what is wrong with people?

703
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,656
What is wrong with her?

704
00:31:46,656 --> 00:31:48,300
People need to calm down.

705
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,620
You don't go after somebody with your car,

706
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,120
a vehicle that could kill people,

707
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,350
when you were hit by a
snowball, it's just ridiculous.

708
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:57,760
- And the thing is, she could
have lost control of that car,

709
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,237
in the snow, so it's so ridiculous.

710
00:32:01,237 --> 00:32:03,702
- I'm glad nobody got
hurt, but I'm also glad

711
00:32:03,702 --> 00:32:06,285
that she was caught because
she was drinking and driving.

712
00:32:06,285 --> 00:32:08,442
So at least she got arrested.

713
00:32:08,442 --> 00:32:11,443
So I'm glad she did do what she did.

714
00:32:11,443 --> 00:32:13,400
- It's a good reminder about

715
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,210
these kind of videos everywhere, right?

716
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:17,730
Even if you're not drunk.

717
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:19,890
When I was at the Grammys the other day

718
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:23,600
I was trying to see Linda
perform her section with Dolly,

719
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,710
and I was backstage with her,

720
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:29,060
and then I went to go
get seated during it.

721
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,790
And they kept saying,
oh it's a commercial,

722
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:33,830
you can't go in, okay now
you can't sit in your seat,

723
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,384
and I was like, you know those moments

724
00:32:35,384 --> 00:32:36,900
where you're like, I have to.

725
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,830
I was like cool it Sara,

726
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:41,393
because there's videos everywhere.

727
00:32:41,393 --> 00:32:43,183
It's like you learn.

728
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:48,930
Not that I would anyway, but
you just can't take your life

729
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:51,320
out on other people, which
is what I always think

730
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,153
these things are.

731
00:32:52,153 --> 00:32:54,026
Something else is bothering this person.

732
00:32:54,026 --> 00:32:57,026
(audience applauds)

733
00:32:58,394 --> 00:33:00,922
- It's a little
neighborhood snowball fight.

734
00:33:00,922 --> 00:33:02,932
Why didn't you get involved in the fight?

735
00:33:02,932 --> 00:33:05,270
She could have jumped out the car,

736
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:07,400
balled a snowball up, and said I got you

737
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,260
and then hit them.

738
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,840
Then it would have been
fun in the neighborhood.

739
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,520
We're just not neighbors anymore.

740
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,600
- Maybe it would have sobered her up too.

741
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,450
- To be out in the cold in that snow.

742
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,910
- We think of everything.

743
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,730
- Sober up and don't run people over.

744
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:25,280
We'll be right back.
(audience applauds)

745
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,253
- [Announcer] Coming up next,

746
00:33:27,253 --> 00:33:28,493

(audience applauds)

749
00:33:34,277 --> 00:33:35,913
- Are you ready for this?

750
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:36,746
- She doesn't like it.

751
00:33:36,746 --> 00:33:37,950
You gotta get in there.

752
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,910
Be careful not to get it in her eyes.

753
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:41,860
(baby crying)
- I know what a bath is.

754
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,533
- Smile honey.

755
00:33:43,533 --> 00:33:46,180
- First kid.
- Here we go.

756
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,536
- Second kid.
- Coming in, Mommy?

757
00:33:48,536 --> 00:33:49,646
- Not a chance.

758
00:33:49,646 --> 00:33:51,130
- By their second kid,
every parent is an expert

759
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:53,450
and more likely to choose
Luvs than first-time parents.

760
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:56,230
Luvs with Night Luv Plus
absorbs wetness faster

761
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:57,530
than Huggies Snug and Dry.

763
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,340
at a fraction of the cost.

764
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,010
Live, learn, and get Luvs.

765
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,813
- On tour, every second counts.

766
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,810
I need great, without the weight.

767
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:12,550

778
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:40,923
My PT says I'm in the top
5% fittest in the state.

779
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,720
Fun fact, I have a huge office.

but I'm relentless too.

off, and neither will I.

We have the moment that
you guys found out.

880
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,180
So Tichina, what was
going through your mind?

881
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,623
- My daughter's tuition.

882
00:39:23,842 --> 00:39:27,390
We're regular people,
we're just working actors.

883
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:31,180
We're blessed to be working.

play your white neighbors,
the only white couple

887
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,740
in "The Neighborhood", but Cedric,

888
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,440
I heard when you moved
to L.A., you sort of had

889
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,343
a similar fish-out-of-water experience.

890
00:39:53,343 --> 00:39:56,170
- Yeah, I moved into an
all-Latino neighborhood

891
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:58,140
when I first moved to L.A.,

892
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:04,523
so I had to learn there's a
lot of food going come over.

893
00:40:06,787 --> 00:40:08,870
It's a lot of cooking going on.

894
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:12,740
Corn with sauce and
mayonnaise and all that.

895
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,340
I didn't know what was going on.

896
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,033
But it was cool though.

897
00:40:17,868 --> 00:40:19,818
- Then you actually, your Walk of Fame.

898
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:23,387
- My star on the Walk of Fame.
- Yes.

899
00:40:25,687 --> 00:40:29,277
- I used to walk around there of course

900
00:40:29,277 --> 00:40:30,929
and see all these stars.

901
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:34,750
You just come to Hollywood from St. Louis.

902
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,810
And so now, when I got my star,

903
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:38,490
I was literally a block over from where

904
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:39,810
I first moved to L.A.

905
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:42,350
That was just kind of like so cool.

906
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:45,350
(audience applauds)

907
00:40:46,353 --> 00:40:48,436
- Hi Sharon.
- Hi Tichina.

908
00:40:50,847 --> 00:40:54,080
You and Cedric have been
playing husband and wife

909
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,656
for a year now.
- Yes.

910
00:40:55,656 --> 00:41:00,555
Does any of that like go on
off when you're not working?

911
00:41:00,555 --> 00:41:02,155
Do you take care of him?

912
00:41:02,155 --> 00:41:05,149
- Oh most definitely, I
don't play with his wife.

913
00:41:05,149 --> 00:41:07,480
Lorna does not play,

914
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,370
and I fill her shoes

915
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:11,940
as best as I can when he's on that set.

916
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,958
So I make sure that he rests.

917
00:41:13,958 --> 00:41:15,450
You know he takes moments.

918
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:16,920
I didn't tell you

919
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,120
I took a video of you
snoring the other day.

920
00:41:22,705 --> 00:41:25,870
People don't realize this
man runs a whole show

921
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:27,670
but he's also on the road.

922
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:30,078
So he's doing comedy on weekends.

923
00:41:30,078 --> 00:41:32,913
I gotta take care of my Boo, my Set Boo,

924
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:36,867
I make sure he's all right.

925
00:41:36,867 --> 00:41:39,980
Cedric is just such an
amazing human being.

926
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:42,870
Like literally this man I've
known for 20-something years.

927
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:45,040
This is the first time he
and I have worked together.

928
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,290
I have seen this man treat
everybody with respect.

929
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:50,490
From the person that moves the cables.

930
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:55,080
To the first person there
in the morning on our set.

931
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,070
He treats everybody the same.

932
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:59,389
So I'm happy to have him as my friend.

933
00:41:59,389 --> 00:42:02,109
(audience applauds)

934
00:42:02,109 --> 00:42:05,710
- The great Marla Gibbs,
who we all know from 227,

935
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:07,620
was guest on the show this week.

936
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:08,973
So Cedric, what was it
like working with her?

937
00:42:08,973 --> 00:42:11,843
- I mean, of course,
Marla Gibbs, is an icon.

938
00:42:13,449 --> 00:42:15,900
I was always a fan of 227,

939
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,973
but when she was on The Jeffersons.

940
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:21,710
I wanted to get into a
little riff with her.

941
00:42:22,659 --> 00:42:23,870
She was funny though.

942
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:25,963
She is so great, so gracious.

943
00:42:27,478 --> 00:42:29,930
It was just awesome to
have her on the set.

944
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:31,869
This iconic personality.

945
00:42:31,869 --> 00:42:34,110
She loved it, she loved being at work.

946
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:37,270
And to have been doing it for so long

947
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:39,430
that it was just really awesome for us

948
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:41,090
to be able to provide that opportunity.

949
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:42,288
She had a great time.

950
00:42:42,288 --> 00:42:44,205
- And she was off book.

951
00:42:47,522 --> 00:42:51,109
Marla has done a lot
for the black community.

952
00:42:51,109 --> 00:42:55,276
She has done amazing work
for the black community.

953
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:00,930
- Pretty incredible, but
last week on the episode,

954
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:02,080
there featured a girls' trip

955
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,117
to a Magic Mike show in Las Vegas.

956
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:10,669
Did you crash the party a little there?

957
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:16,122
(crosstalk drowns out conversation)

958
00:43:18,587 --> 00:43:20,336
- Saying hello to the gentlemen.

959
00:43:20,336 --> 00:43:22,586
- Look at Ced, look at Ced.

960
00:43:26,493 --> 00:43:28,826
- And then I pulled a hamstring.

961
00:43:28,826 --> 00:43:31,909
(audience applauds)

962
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:33,826
- I got a little bit...

963
00:43:37,974 --> 00:43:39,350
The guys were a little nervous

964
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:40,550
about taking their shirts off,

965
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:43,573
and so I said guys let
me show you how its done.

966
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:49,174
- You dance, you sing, you
dance, you do all that.

967
00:43:49,174 --> 00:43:53,007
(audience applauds excitedly)

968
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:15,232
- To get through college,
I was known as Cupcakes.

969
00:44:19,386 --> 00:44:22,160
- Ceddy, I got to see you just recently.

970
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,440
You were hosting the "Motown 60",

971
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,185
a Grammy celebration,
which was incredible.

972
00:44:28,185 --> 00:44:32,130
It airs on April 21st, and you co-hosted

973
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:34,370
with Mr. Smokey Robinson

974
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:36,610
and so many other incredible performers.

975
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:38,156
Did you get to hang out with anybody

976
00:44:38,156 --> 00:44:41,210
or see anybody that you never met before?

977
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:44,753
- The only person I really
was stalking was Diana Ross,

978
00:44:46,469 --> 00:44:49,307
and I guess it got pretty
obvious that I was stalking her

979
00:44:49,307 --> 00:44:51,410
'cause her security wouldn't let me get

980
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:53,130
close enough, you know.

981
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:54,040
But I did the whole,

982
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,847
went to Berry Gordy first and then,

983
00:44:55,847 --> 00:44:58,027
"Hey Diana, how you doing?"

984
00:44:59,769 --> 00:45:02,508
Tried it but they wouldn't
let me get close to her.

985
00:45:02,508 --> 00:45:05,190
- But why?
- I don't know.

986
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:08,148
- I would have called Tracy,
we should have called Tracy.

987
00:45:08,148 --> 00:45:10,990
Tell your Mama we looking for her!

988
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:12,760
- Tichina let me ask you something

989
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:13,870
that everybody's been looking for

990
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:15,523
is the Martin reboot.

991
00:45:16,382 --> 00:45:18,652
(audience applauds)
- Everybody's waiting for that

992
00:45:18,652 --> 00:45:21,130
What can you tell us, what can you share?

993
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:24,210
- I will share that Martin
called me about a month ago,

994
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:28,650
and he got some good
news about a huge network

995
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:31,233
wanting to take it on, so
we'll see, fingers crossed.

996
00:45:31,233 --> 00:45:36,007
But it will never be
the same without Tommy.

997
00:45:36,007 --> 00:45:37,910
Martin's show will never
be the same without Tommy,

998
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:41,063
so it's not a reboot, I call it a rebirth.

999
00:45:43,663 --> 00:45:44,623
- When we come back we have

1000
00:45:44,623 --> 00:45:46,764

1004
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:02,760
- [Male Announcer] When
you eat a bowl of oatmeal,

1005
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,660
you're getting Beta Glucan.

1006
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:06,290
That's a soluble fiber that slows

1007
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:08,350
the breakdown of carbohydrates,

1008
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:10,150

1021
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:47,280
- My mom washes the dishes
before she puts them

1022
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,910

does the dishwasher do?

1023
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:53,230
- Cascade Platinum does the work for you,

1024
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:56,380

stuck-on foods the first time.

1025

- [Announcer] The day
after chemo shouldn't mean

1028
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,160
going back to the doctor just for a shot.

1029

With Neulasta Onpro,
patients get their day back.

1030
00:47:07,234 --> 00:47:11,170
To be with family or just to sleep in.

1031
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:14,110
Strong chemo can put you at
risk of serious infection.

1032
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:16,210
In a key study, Neulasta reduced the risk

1033
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:20,854
of infection for 17%
to 1%, a 94% decrease.

1034
00:47:20,854 --> 00:47:23,240
Neulasta Onpro is designed
to deliver Neulasta

Do not take Neulasta if
you are allergic to it

00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,600
or Neupogen, filgrastim.

1040
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,010
An incomplete dose could
increase infection risk.

1102
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:52,580
really knows about each
other in a game we're calling

1103
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:54,978
Husband and Wife but Not in Real Life.

1104
00:49:54,978 --> 00:49:59,478
(cheering)
(clapping)

1105
00:50:01,608 --> 00:50:05,060
Before the show, we
asked Tichina and Cedric

1106
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:06,650
a few questions about themselves,

1107
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:08,240
and now it's time to see if they can guess

1108
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,150
how the other person answered.

1109
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:11,970
If they can get three matches,

1110
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:14,680
everyone in our studio audience
goes home with a prize.

1111
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:15,702
Are you ready?

1112
00:50:15,702 --> 00:50:18,535
(audience cheers)

1113
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:22,417
Pressure's on.

1114
00:50:22,417 --> 00:50:25,040
(Cedric coughing)

1115
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:28,328
- No whispering answers, no whispering.

1116
00:50:28,328 --> 00:50:29,670
- [Cedric] John David?

1117
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:32,789
First person, okay Cedric.

1118
00:50:32,789 --> 00:50:35,349
- [Tichina] I'm nervous.

1119
00:50:35,349 --> 00:50:40,020
- Who is Tichina's
favorite musical artist?

1120
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:42,093
- Oh wow, I'm going to say,

1121
00:50:45,461 --> 00:50:46,823
I'm going, Aretha Franklin.

1122
00:50:48,099 --> 00:50:49,310
- Tichina, is he right?

1123
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:53,620
- Close baby close.
(buzzer buzzes)

1124
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:57,423
- Very close, okay Sharon, you're up.

1125
00:51:03,676 --> 00:51:05,467
- Okay, who is...

1126
00:51:07,134 --> 00:51:09,320
now you guys come on.

1127
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:11,180
- [Sara] You gotta move it along
or you won't get any right.

1128
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:15,280
- Who is Cedric's celebrity crush.

1129
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,360
- Oh yeah.

1130
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,713
- I'm gonna go with Rihanna.

1131
00:51:18,713 --> 00:51:19,920
- Is that right?

1132
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:24,470
Rihanna she's young still
but she's still woman,

1133
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:27,223
and she's just awesomely talented.

1134
00:51:29,597 --> 00:51:32,112
- [Sara] Cedric, let's see the answer.

1135
00:51:32,112 --> 00:51:36,600
- I said...
(buzzer buzzes)

1136
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,230
- [Sara] Carrie Anne, you're up.

1137
00:51:40,693 --> 00:51:43,974
- You guys better pull it together here.

1138
00:51:43,974 --> 00:51:45,380
Cedric your turn.

1139
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:46,300
Cedric, focus.

1140
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:49,210
Who is Tichina's celebrity crush?

1141
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:51,387
- Cedric The Entertainer.

1142
00:51:51,387 --> 00:51:53,600
(audience laughs)

1143
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,080
- [Sara] Final answer,
is he right Tichina?

1144
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:59,680
- No, he ain't right.
(buzzer buzzes)

1145
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:04,229
- John David Washington,
Denzel's son, right?

1146
00:52:04,229 --> 00:52:07,298
- [Sara] Okay, now we got Sheryl.

1147
00:52:07,298 --> 00:52:11,930
- Tichina, what movie
always makes Cedric cry?

1148
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:13,940
- I wanna say "The Five Heartbeats".

1149
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:15,580
- [Sara] Is she correct Cedric?

1150
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:19,269
I'm guessing she's not
based on her track record.

1151
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:21,936
(buzzer buzzes)

1152
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:27,067
- We've got another question.

1153
00:52:28,978 --> 00:52:31,483
- So, Cedric, what is
Tichina's biggest fear?

1154
00:52:37,109 --> 00:52:40,749
- Imma go with bugs,
maybe bugs or something.

1155
00:52:40,749 --> 00:52:41,930
- [Sara] Bugs, is he right?

1156
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:45,817
- You are so right.
(audience cheers)

1157
00:52:48,787 --> 00:52:53,100
- Sharon, let's do one
more question quickly here.

1158
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:58,100
- All right, which celebrity
does Cedric text the most?

1159
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:01,530
- Oh this is a no-brainer, Steve Harvey.

1160
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:02,770
(audience cheers)

1161
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:04,103

1162

Let's see it Cedric, we gotta go to break.

1163
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,450
- I was going to say George
Lopez, but Steve first.

1164
00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:13,200
(audience gasps)

1184
00:54:08,083 --> 00:54:09,963
- I don't look the same every day.

1185
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:14,833
- The Talk, on CBS.

1186
00:54:14,833 --> 00:54:18,610
- [Announcer] If you, like
many people, are covered

1187
00:54:18,610 --> 00:54:21,021
by both Medicare and
your state's Medicaid,

1188
00:54:21,021 --> 00:54:23,400
here's something important to know.

1189
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,370
Now you can get even more health benefits

1190
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:26,593
than you already have.

1191
00:54:28,679 --> 00:54:29,512
It's the UnitedHealthcare
Dual Complete plan.

1192

We can explain it all
and answer any questions.

1196
00:54:40,430 --> 00:54:44,070
Medicaid gives you benefits,
and Medicare gives you some too

1197
00:54:44,070 --> 00:54:45,798
but a Dual Complete plan can add even more

1198
00:54:45,798 --> 00:54:49,380
benefits and features
compared to original Medicare.

1199
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:52,610
You'll have lots of doctors
and hospitals to chose from,

1200
00:54:52,610 --> 00:54:54,750
plus prescription drug coverage,

1201
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:56,420
and depending on where you live,

1202
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:58,393
you can enjoy other benefits too.

1203
00:54:59,470 --> 00:55:02,700
Like dental care, vision coverage,

1204
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:05,539
and rides to and from
your doctor or hospital.

1205
00:55:05,539 --> 00:55:08,470
You can even get a health products catalog

1206
00:55:08,470 --> 00:55:11,470
with credits you can use
to shop for everyday things

1207
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:15,230
like vitamins, oral health
items, and first aid kids.

1208
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:17,280
And best of all, with this plan,

1209
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,253
there is no additional cost to you.

1210
00:55:20,566 --> 00:55:23,626
Remember, if you have
Medicare and Medicaid,

1211
00:55:23,626 --> 00:55:26,987
chances are you can get
a Dual Complete plan.

and take you through
everything step by step.

1215
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,930
We know healthcare can be confusing.

1216
00:55:38,930 --> 00:55:41,293

00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,020
better prescription drug coverage,

1222
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:56,320
dental and vision coverage too.

1223
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,610
All at no additional cost.

1224
00:55:58,610 --> 00:56:01,198
You have Medicare, you have Medicaid.

1225
00:56:01,198 --> 00:56:04,590
You may be eligible for Dual Complete.

1226
