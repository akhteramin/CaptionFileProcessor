00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:11,103
- Hi.

5
00:00:11,103 --> 00:00:12,960
- [Woman] Look at how great you look.

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,100
- Thank you.

7
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,500
- I've been on a diet for
as long as I can remember.

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,370
- I even cut out bread
and pasta for a day.

9
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,610
- I decided something needed

10
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:24,050
to change and then I tried Noom.

11
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:24,883
- Noom worked for me.

12
00:00:24,883 --> 00:00:26,380
- It's an easy to stick to program

13
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,820
that actually changed my habits.

14
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,400
- They say it's based on a
cognitive behavioral approach.

15
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,470
I just say it works.

16
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,170
- It just clicked, it works.

17
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,800
It worked with Noom.

- If you bought a
timeshare for your family

42
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,900
by now you've learned the ugly truth.

43
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,420
Timeshares are the only
thing that you can buy

44
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,530
that you don't know how
much it's gonna cost

45
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,260
or when it's gonna end.

46
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,150
It's like giving them a blank check

47
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,610
for annual maintenance
and assessment fees.

48
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,150
Sounds crazy, right?

49
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,070
The ugly truth is that this never ends.

50
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,830
Even when you die your family

51
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,410
will be stuck with this burden.

52
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,890

- [Presenter] The app today.

67
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,030
- How do you learn how
to run when you've never

68
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,640
done anything remotely like this before?

69
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,810
- We're prepare to do it in a
novel way, in an original way

70
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,110
and we wanna make sure we're
writing our own playbook.

71
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,400
- Do you think we should
keep troops in Afghanistan?

72
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,190
- I do not and I believe that we need

73
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,093
to it though in a responsible way.

74
00:02:41,413 --> 00:02:42,410
(engaging music)

75
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:43,900
- Where do you see your party right now?

76
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,850
- It's going to be how do we
think government should work

77
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,957
and who do we think
government should work for.

78
00:02:49,957 --> 00:02:52,707
(engaging music)

79
00:02:54,892 --> 00:02:57,725
(patriotic music)

80
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,500
- It was July 2017, when
Donald Trump, just months

81
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,690
into his presidency visited
France on Bastille Day.

82
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:21,640
He attended a military parade
at Emmanuel Macron's side.

83
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,350
He was impressed.

84
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,860
The military might, the
soldiers, the tanks,

85
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,910
he wanted his own parade.

86
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:32,070
Two years later it looks
like he is getting his wish.

87
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:35,150
Here in Washington, the Lincoln
Memorial is being prepped

88
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,770
for a Trump-branded July
4th spectacular, including:

89
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,020
a speech, a possible
Air Force One flyover,

90
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,650
and you guessed it, tanks.

91
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,780
There's not only concern
about the potential

92
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,510
partisan nature of the President's event

93
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,760
but those tanks have
also proven a bit tricky

94
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,070
for the Commander in Chief.

95
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,273
Here he was yesterday.

96
00:03:56,001 --> 00:03:58,340
- We're gonna have some
tanks stationed outside.

97
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,350
You gotta be pretty careful
with the tanks because

98
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,310
the roads have a tendency
not to like to carry

99
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,080
heavy tanks, so we have to
put 'em in certain areas.

100
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,477
But we have the brand new Sherman tanks

101
00:04:06,477 --> 00:04:09,980
and we have the brand new Abram tanks,

102
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:14,170
and we have some incredible
equipment, military equipment

103
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:18,133
on display, brand-new and
we're very proud of it.

104
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,420
- So a couple issues
here for the President.

105
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,690
One, Sherman tanks have not been

106
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:26,330
in active service since the 1950s.

107
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,510
Problem two, the tanks that are coming

108
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:33,370
weigh about 60 tons each and
there is very real concern

109
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,980
that they could do major damage

110
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,860
to the capital city's streets, bridges,

111
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,820
and of course our country's
famed National Mall.

112
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,560
Joining me now, Washington Post
Senior Affairs correspondent

113
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,290
Juliet Eilperin, and former
Senior Advisor to Ash Carter

114
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:50,210
and Professor at Amherst
College, Mark Jacobson.

115
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,950
- Juliet, we're gonna talk with Mark here

116
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,430
in a second about the tanks, but first

117
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,410
the concerns potentially
here about partisanship

118
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,740
on what is typically a patriotic holiday

119
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,840
celebrated by all
Americans, Kellyanne Conway

120
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,150
this morning insisted that
it would be apolitical.

121
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:09,983
Take a look.

122
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,160
- This is a public event,
it's open to the public.

123
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,930
The public is welcome
to come and celebrate

124
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,940
our great country, the greatest democracy,

125
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,310
the Constitution, all the amendments,

126
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:30,640
not just the 1st Amendment that
seems to interest you only,

127
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,140
the 2nd Amendment, all
the other, but really just

128
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:33,980
the birth of this country,

129
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,230
the greatest democracy that ever lived.

130
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,373
I'm not gonna allow you to politicize it.

131
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,020
- Fair to say that it
is open to the public

132
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,000
however there is the VIP
section right up front

133
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,260
where typically anyone would be able to be

134
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,310
in that area of the Mall
to watch the fireworks

135
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,980
if you got there early enough.

136
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,640
But now the RNC has
gotten tickets and the DNC

137
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,140
tells our Peter Alexander
that they haven't received

138
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,306
an allotment of tickets
for that area at all.

139
00:05:58,306 --> 00:06:01,000
It kind of undermines this argument.

140
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,790
- Sure, the fact that
there's limited VIP seating,

141
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,540
which we reported on last week, shows you

142
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:10,860
that really that there are
some political elements.

143
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,970
Now the RNC, we checked with them today,

144
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:15,080
they're arguing that in the same way

145
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,930
that if a Democrat was in the White House

146
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,370
they would give tickets to their party.

147
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,960
That these things happen for
White House holiday tours,

148
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,940
for things like that, that's
accurate although again

149
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,780
those are where you have
limits on who can be here.

150
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,510
This traditionally has
been an entirely open event

151
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:33,300
and its now being modified to have

152
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,350
limited access in part of the Mall.

153
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,450
- [Kasie] And we are of
course gonna get a speech

154
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:40,670
from the President, I
mean it's hard to argue

155
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,360
that any speech in this kind

156
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,323
of a forum would be an apolitical one.

157
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,540
- Well one of the things is it really

158
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,040
will matter what he
says, whether he refers

159
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,690
to for example any of the Democrats

160
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,020
who are currently running
for president in 2020,

161
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,170
whether he talks about
polling, those are all comments

162
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:59,260
that could trigger this provision where

163
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,070
under federal appropriations law

164
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:04,150
you can't use public resources
for political purposes

165
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:07,440
and if they deem that part of
this is a political speech,

166
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,870
the campaign, Trump's
presidential re-election campaign

167
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,830
might have to reimburse the U.S. Treasury

168
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,910
for some of the expenses of this event.

169
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:18,550
- So speaking of those
expenses, Mark Jacobson,

170
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:22,050
these tanks are logistically
difficult to get here.

171
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,880
This is also gonna cost the US military

172
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,340
not an insignificant amount of money.

173
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,830
We're not exactly sure how much,

174
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:31,260
but does the military
community kind of agree here

175
00:07:32,246 --> 00:07:34,610
with the President that
this is a good idea?

176
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,940
- I suspect the military
community and going based

177
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,010
on conversations I've had
with those on active duty

178
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:42,360
and veterans, there's
a a mixed view on this.

179
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,860
One, if you look at this entire week,

180
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,810
this should just be blip compared

181
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,260
to all the mistakes Trump seems

182
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,200
to have made on the
national security front,

183
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,790
but at the same time you
a National Park Service

184
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,610
that's in debt already, well there's

185
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,370
a cost that they can't bear.

186
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,220
You have a bunch of troops
who thought they we're gonna

187
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,710
spend July 4th with their families

188
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,560
who are no longer going to spend July 4th

189
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,975
with their families
and as suggested before

190
00:08:01,975 --> 00:08:05,120
this is exactly the opposite of what

191
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,800
the founding fathers meant
in terms of symbolism.

192
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,550
I mean the United States
was born of a fear

193
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:13,400
of a standing army, the
4th of July has never been

194
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,830
a military celebration; it's a celebration

195
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:18,060
of political independence and the ideals

196
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,950
of the enlightenment in this
traditionally American way.

197
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:24,090
It's not supposed to look like North Korea

198
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,850
or the Soviet Union and that's
what Trump's set up here.

199
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,920
- That's a great point
about our founding fathers

200
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,460
and the way they envisioned this holiday

201
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,730
and what freedom at the time
from England actually meant--

202
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:36,000
- If I could, there's a
great Erma Baumbach quote,

203
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,890
where the late humorist
she talks about 4th of July

204
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:43,150
is about potato salad and
hot dogs and isn't it great

205
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,480
that we live in a country
where we don't have

206
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,240
to have a parade with guns,
and troops, and tanks,

207
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,270
and that that the true
patriotism on this day

208
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,710
is feeling like you've eaten too much.

209
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:53,763
And that's freedom.

210
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,170
- John McCain, there's a
non-profit organization

211
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,040
that's gonna print out shirts

212
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,590
that feature the USS John McCain.

213
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:05,100
What's your take on the symbolism of that?

214
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,070
Is seems as though the
White House certainly wants

215
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,680
to make sure that the people right

216
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,080
in front of the President
are supporting him.

217
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,290
- As you will recall there
was this mission accomplished

218
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:18,790
moment during the visit to
Japan, where the USS John McCain

219
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,340
was supposedly gonna have its name hidden

220
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:24,980
and its sailors weren't invited
to the presidential address.

221
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,380
I think that's again is a way of poking

222
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,511
back at the President.

223
00:09:29,511 --> 00:09:32,210
Again, it's a day where
we celebrate our freedoms

224
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,360
including freedom of speech,
freedom of expression.

225
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,830
I think again the White House should

226
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,710
just have Trump go golfing.

227
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:41,330
That's what presidents
actually do on July 4th.

228
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,170
They go golf.

229
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,720
This would be a great day to
do it, not to get involved,

230
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,460
sit in the White House which used to have

231
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,600
a great view of the fireworks,
and leave this a celebration

232
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,380
of the American people
by the American people.

233
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,390
- All right Juliet
Eilperin, Mark Jacobson,

234
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,430
thank you guys both very much

235
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,320
for your perspectives and reporting today.

236
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,490
Coming up next, Hispanic
Caucus Chair Joaquin Castro

237
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,300
joins me to talk about what he witnessed

238
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,250
during a tour yesterday of
a Texas border facility.

239
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,850
Here's what he said just
moments after that tour.

240
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,170
- One of the women said that she was told

241
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:14,293
by an agent to drink
water out of the toilet.

242
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,550
These are the conditions that have been

243
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,000
created by the Trump administration.

244
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,253
These are the inhumane
conditions that folks are facing.

245
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:32,453
- In America every car is a
declaration of independence

246
00:10:33,742 --> 00:10:36,110
and to celebrate our nation's birthday

247
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,283
we'll do it at Daytona.

248
00:10:38,329 --> 00:10:39,591
(patriotic music)

249
00:10:39,591 --> 00:10:41,903
In a 200 mile per hour blur
of red, white, and blue.

250
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,000
- [Presenter] Thanks, Golden Corral.

251
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,130

252

253
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,340
Oops clams, and mom got it
all hook, line and sirloin.

254
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,270
The slowest smoked
sirloin and shrimp trio.

255

Golden Corral, the only one for everyone.

256
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,700
- As a real estate agent I've learned

257
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,260
it's excess moisture
that causes musty odor.

258
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,110
Pro tip, use DampRid.

259
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,120

Exactly, nothing.

- [Presenter] Mesothelioma,
it's all we do.

322
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,150
With nine offices across the country

323
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,610
we are large enough to
take on big corporations.

324
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:48,930
Let us come meet with you.

325
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:53,930

that's 1-800-500-1895.

326

- At Timeshare Exit Team we've helped

327
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,550
thousands of people get out
of their timeshares forever.

328
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,380
- Timeshare Exit Team sent us a letter

329
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,050
saying that we were free
and clear of the timeshare.

330
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,480
So that was a time to celebrate.

331
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,740
- If you're unhappy with your timeshare

332
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,350
we would love to help you find a way out.

333
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:11,000
- [Presenter] Call 1-800-837-3110.

334
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,650
- [Presenter] A free case review.

335
00:14:14,112 --> 00:14:15,990
(engaging music)

336
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,650
- At this hour, nationwide
demonstrations are underway

337
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:22,360
with protestors demanding
the closures of detention

338
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,260
facilities holding migrant
children and families.

339
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,700
Advocacy groups organized
more than 150 demonstrations.

340
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,850
Some outside of congressional
district offices.

341
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:35,140
While others gathered outside
of detention facilities.

342
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,900
The protests follow
reports of poor conditions

343
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,690
inside some migrant detention
facilities in Texas.

344
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:43,700
And visits to those facilities
by Democratic members

345
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,650
of the Congressional Hispanic
Caucus just yesterday.

346
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:49,130
This, as customs and border
protection has launched

347
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,470
an investigation following
a ProPublica report

348
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:54,720
exposing a secret
Facebook group of current

349
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,270
and former border patrol;
in it members reportedly

350
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:02,410
mocked the death of migrants
and posted sexist memes.

351
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,480
We should note that NBC
News has not verified

352
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,920
the Facebook group or seen the posts.

353
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,120
Joining me now, MSNBC
correspondent Gabe Gutierrez.

354
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,430
Gabe, you're in El Paso
I understand speaking

355
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:15,420
with pediatricians that have
treated migrant children

356
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,360
released from custody; what are they

357
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,593
telling you about how
these kids are doing?

358
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,500
- Hi there Kasie, well we're
outside of Annunciation House

359
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,740
and we've been coming to this
shelter for the past year

360
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:32,740
or so since the family
separation crisis of last year

361
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,040
and they deal with a lot of migrants.

362
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,750
They take in a lot of migrants
that have been processed

363
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,690
by CBP and by ICE and they
end up at this shelter

364
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,560
before they're sent away
all across the country

365
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,630
as they await their asylum proceedings

366
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,860
and what we're hearing now
is over the last couple

367
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,960
of weeks they've gone from
taking about 1000 migrants

368
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,610
a day, now it's about 100, 150.

369
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:56,110
But we're also speaking with
some of the pediatricians

370
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,590
that are treating some of these children

371
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,820
including Dr. Lisa Ayoub-Rodriquez.

372
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,550
YOu're a local pediatrician
at a local hospital

373
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,760
and you are treating
some of these children,

374
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,610
very young children, while
they're in CBP custody

375
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,640
if they're hospitalized
and then after, correct?

376
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,890
So tell me what are you seeing?

377
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:12,640
- That's right, for
the last several months

378
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,250
we've had the privilege
to be able to take care

379
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,870
of children who while are in CBP custody

380
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,280
if they need to be hospitalized,

381
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,990
they go to the hospital
and we care for them,

382
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:26,220
or if after they are
discharged from CPB custody

383
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,360
and they're in Annunciation
House, if they need

384
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,660
to be admitted to the
hospital we take care

385
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,830
of them there as well.

386
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:33,967
We see a lot of common childhood illnesses

387
00:16:33,967 --> 00:16:38,170
in this population, a lot of influenza,

388
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:39,640
stomach bugs, those kinds of things.

389
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,540
The population is really
unique in that they get

390
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,880
a little bit sicker
because they already are

391
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,200
a little compromised in
that they're dehydrated,

392
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,840
their nutrition isn't as expected,

393
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,294
so they have the potential
to be sicker, faster.

394
00:16:51,294 --> 00:16:56,000
- When we toured the Clint,
Texas border patrol station

395
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,880
last week we weren't allowed
to talk to these children.

396
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,530
Members of Congress have now been there

397
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:00,680
and they are telling stories of their

398
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,040
communication with these children.

399
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,470
What have you heard some of these parents,

400
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:06,000
some of these children, have you

401
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,240
heard anything that troubles you?

402
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,580
- Yeah, I often talk to the families

403
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,550
who have been in CPB custody and ask them

404
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:15,240
a little bit about what their
time there has been like.

405
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,280
Most recently a met a young
mom who had a newborn baby

406
00:17:20,387 --> 00:17:22,540
and who was talking about
the challenges of keeping

407
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,840
her little newborn warm;
so they had given her

408
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,010
a plastic blanket and
the baby was in a onesie,

409
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:29,800
but really she was snuggling with the baby

410
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,380
and she was like, I just
couldn't keep the baby warm,

411
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,640
just despite whatever I
did I just couldn't keep

412
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,560
my baby warm, she talked
about the little hands

413
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,240
and the feet being blue
which was troubling to me and

414
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,520
that's just a simple, basic
human need that concerned me.

415
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,563
- Thank you Dr. Ayoub-Rodriguez
and one last question:

416
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:48,580
based on your experience and
your opinion should children

417
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,730
this young be kept in these
types of holding facilities?

418
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,020
- No children should be
in a holding facility.

419
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,770
They need access to their basic needs.

420
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:57,770
If their child is sick they
need access to medical care

421
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:00,640
by a trained pediatric professional.

422
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,880
Really it's not a place for any kid to be.

423
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,817
- Dr. thank you for speaking with us.

424
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:07,450
So Kasie, this, the
ongoing situation down here

425
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,970
on the border, earlier we were
at that border patrol station

426
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:12,920
in Clint, Texas, of course as
you mentioned that controversy

427
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,810
following the ProPublica report.

428
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:18,582
This appears to be a debate
with no end in sight.

429
00:18:18,582 --> 00:18:19,520
Kasie.

430
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,190
- Absolutely heartbreaking to
hear about an infant so cold

431
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,330
that their hands and feet turn blue.

432
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:24,930
Gabe Gutierrez, thank you very much

433
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,950
as always for your reporting on this.

434
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:29,840
When the delegation of
Democratic lawmakers toured

435
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,730
those migrant detention
centers along the border

436
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,110
they were told to surrender
their devices before

437
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,330
they would be allowed
to enter the facilities.

438
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:39,790
But Congressman Joaquin
Castro of Texas was able

439
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:42,510
to sneak a phone, in with
the consent of the women

440
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:45,340
in custody Castro filmed their small cell

441
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:48,370
which included a toilet
but no running water.

442
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,460
He posted the images on
Twitter saying quote:

443
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,620
many said they had not bathed for 15 days.

444
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,810
Some had been separated from children.

445
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:58,690
Some had been held for more than 50 days.

446
00:18:58,690 --> 00:18:59,890
Several complained that they

447
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:02,280
had not received their medication.

448
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,350
Joining me now, Texas Democratic
Congressman Joaquin Castro.

449
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,840
Congressman Castro is the Chairman

450
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,750
of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.

451
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,660
Congressman thank you
for being here today.

452
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,400
- Yeah, thanks for having me.

453
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,830
- So I wanna start with the basics here.

454
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:17,130
I think it's hard for a
lot of Americans to wrap

455
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:19,730
their heads around the
idea that you as members

456
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:22,800
of Congress, regardless of
what party you may belong to

457
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,950
aren't able to go into
facilities that our government

458
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:29,270
is paying for and actually
document what you see.

459
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,523
What did it take for you to get your phone

460
00:19:31,523 --> 00:19:35,453
into this facility so that those
images could get out there?

461
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,530
- I just kept in my pocket when

462
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,840
they told us to put it on the table.

463
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,930
We asked them repeatedly,
we challenged them

464
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:45,340
and asked them what law allows them

465
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:48,370
to force us to keep our phones and cameras

466
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:52,270
away from the facility and
the border patrol chief there

467
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:54,800
couldn't give us an answer, in
fact there was a lawyer there

468
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,470
and she couldn't give us an answer,

469
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:59,890
and so at that point
as far as I'm concerned

470
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:03,150
they have no right to
try to keep legislators

471
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:06,100
who are entrusted with
oversight of their agency

472
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,130
from documenting what they see.

473
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:10,230
Particularly, given what's at stake

474
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,570
and given what's going on right now.

475
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:15,805
- So what in your view could
possibly be the explanation?

476
00:20:15,805 --> 00:20:19,466
I think it strikes a lot
of people that they simply

477
00:20:19,466 --> 00:20:22,500
don't want anyone to find out
what is actually going on.

478
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,223
- And I think that that's right.

479
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,040
I think that they're scared.

480
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:30,040
I think that the reason
things don't change the way

481
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,600
they should is because these
things are kept secret.

482
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,050
For example, there was
a point at which we were

483
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,670
in one of tents that was empty.

484
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:39,820
They had already moved
everybody out and these are dark

485
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,270
tents with chain-link fences
and when the search happened

486
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:48,200
they had maybe 100, 200 people
in there and they had said

487
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,850
you can't take pictures because you can't

488
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:52,280
violate the privacy of these children.

489
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,590
And so we said okay
well this tent is empty.

490
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:55,720
There's nobody in here.

491
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,670
Can we take a photo of the tent?

492
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,890
And they said no, you can't
take a photo of the tent.

493
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,230
It doesn't make any sense.

494
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:03,323
They're trying to keep everything secret.

495
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,570
- So they are of course pushing
back on some of the claims

496
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:12,068
that you've heard from
these women that you show

497
00:21:12,068 --> 00:21:15,493
in your video and from
others that you spoke to.

498
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,930
Do you have any reason not to believe

499
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:20,853
what these migrant detainees told you?

500
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,700
- I don't, they spoke sincerely.

501
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,310
In fact, there was a point
where one of the women

502
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:29,740
who was Cuban, she spoke
some English and in front

503
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:32,560
of all of us, many of
the legislators and also

504
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:37,110
several CBP officers, she
challenged them very directly

505
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,170
and said that they were
not telling the truth

506
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:41,720
about the standard of
care and the treatment,

507
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,200
and she said that some
of the agents had used

508
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,780
derogatory words, language,
against the women.

509
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,620
Now, I'm not saying that she said that all

510
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,030
of the agents did that, but she said that,

511
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,260
it sounded to me like a few of them had.

512
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,660
So she very directly
challenged them in front

513
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,650
of all us and that's one of the reasons

514
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,120
that these women were
scared of retribution.

515
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,550
But, if there's a dispute
about what the truth is

516
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:06,250
in those facilities then I think

517
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,180
there's a very easy way to solve that.

518
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,980
They have cameras up
in all of those rooms.

519
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:14,230
They can simply put out the
video from all those cameras

520
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,910
and they can let the press do their jobs

521
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,560
and go inside there, and the press

522
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,360
can be the tiebreaker
about what's going on.

523
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,960
- So the government has footage

524
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,680
of what's gone on in these facilities?

525
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,960
They've been videotaping,
all of this is on camera

526
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,530
and yet we as the American
public just can't see it?

527
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:31,320
- Yeah look, they knew that I was

528
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,230
taking a picture of those folks.

529
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:35,170
They knew that I pulled my camera out.

530
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:37,620
I'm sure somebody was
watching me in that room.

531
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,860
I saw the overhead camera right there.

532
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:42,100
There were probably five agents
that we're watching that.

533
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,280
So they have footage of all of that.

534
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,390
- So to pick up on another
point that you were making.

535
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:52,260
You said in this facility
there were border patrol agents

536
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:55,030
or personnel that have
been accused of behaving

537
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:57,620
frankly in way that's not becoming

538
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:00,452
of people who wear a uniform
of the United States.

539
00:23:00,452 --> 00:23:05,042
There's also been ProPublica
reporting on a secret

540
00:23:05,042 --> 00:23:08,860
Facebook group that many
border patrol agents

541
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,850
and former agents are a
member of where they have said

542
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:15,070
some pretty despicable things
allegedly and that there

543
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:18,080
is now an investigation going on.

544
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,840
What should happen to
the people who are found

545
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,240
to be making these kinds of comments

546
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,320
and be treating people this way?

547
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,340
- Well the people that made
those very direct comments

548
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:33,590
about some of the members of Congress,

549
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:37,070
about some of the people that
were entrusted in their care,

550
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:40,980
they are desensitized to
the point of being dangerous

551
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,690
to the migrants and
also to their coworkers

552
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,780
and they need to be relieved of duty.

553
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,370
They really should not
be wearing any uniform

554
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:50,860
that represents the
United States of America.

555
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:54,970
And also the agents that
were on there that did not

556
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:58,110
turn those people in need to be dealt with

557
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:00,853
and held accountable in some way also.

558
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:06,370
- Do you take any issue with
how your Democratic leaders

559
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:09,900
in Congress handled
the recent funding bill

560
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,630
to try and help alleviate this crisis?

561
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:15,440
I mean the money that
ultimately is gonna be spent

562
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,790
as part of that bill doesn't
have some of the restrictions

563
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:21,730
that Democrats wanted, many progressives

564
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:25,240
were very angry about
how that all played out.

565
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,860
Do you feel as though your
leadership acted in bad faith

566
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:33,440
and did Congress give too much
to the Trump administration

567
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,010
as they claim that they're
trying to deal with this?

568
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:39,320
- Well I think they mostly
ran up against a buzzsaw,

569
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:43,000
Mitch McConnell and President
Trump who don't care very much

570
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,940
for the people that are in
those detention centers.

571
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:49,190
There's no question that we
needed stronger safeguards

572
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:52,610
or guardrails around that
money so that it can't be

573
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:55,460
transferred out and away
from humanitarian aid,

574
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,930
and also, we also needed not just to pump

575
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:02,430
a bunch more cash into these facilities,

576
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:07,400
for example, when we passed
through some of the walkways

577
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,730
we saw stacks of granola bars.

578
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:12,220
I looked in another cell
and there was a family

579
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,230
that was eating ramen, they were huddled

580
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:16,420
on the floor eating ramen noodles.

581
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,340
So it's not just about more cash for them

582
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,810
to buy ramen noodles and granola bars.

583
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,400
You have to change the medical standards

584
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,370
and also the standards
of care and treatment,

585
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:29,690
and unfortunately in that
Senate bill that finally passed

586
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:32,770
there isn't enough of that;
we need to do a better job.

587
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:34,880
- All right, Texas

588

your time today, sir.

00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:33,990
- Whatever's in the chair
to make it comfortable.

628
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:36,390
It has a very durable feel to it.

629
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,430
I feel like this chair is going

630
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:39,690
to be part of our living
room for a very long time

631
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:41,250
- [Presenter] Shop beautiful, modern

637
00:27:55,652 --> 00:27:56,602
That's HomeAdvisor.

638
00:27:56,602 --> 00:27:57,550
- [Presenter] You can't
expect your neighbors

639
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:00,124
to do it all so just ask HomeAdvisor.

640
00:28:00,124 --> 00:28:02,874
(engaging music)

641
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:12,180
- [Presenter] Corey is living
with metastatic breast cancer

642
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,680
which is breast cancer that has spread

643
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,063
to other parts of her body.

644
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:19,490
She's also taking Ibrance
with an aromatase inhibitor

645
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,130
which is for postmenopausal woman

646
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:25,100
or for men with HR+, HER2-
metastatic breast cancer

647
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,390
as the first hormonal based therapy.

648
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:30,140
Ibrance plus letrozole was
significantly more effective

649
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:33,040
at delaying disease
progression versus letrozole.

650
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,650
Patients taking Ibrance can
develop low white blood cell

651
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:37,740
counts which may cause serious infections

652
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:40,150
that can lead to death;
before taking Ibrance

653
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:42,170
tell your doctor if
you have fever, chills,

654
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:44,870
or other signs of infection,
liver or kidney problems

655
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:47,700
are pregnant, breast-feeding,
or plan to become pregnant.

656
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,950
Common side effects
include low red blood cell

657
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:52,490
and low platelet counts,
infections, tiredness,

658
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:55,780
nausea, sore mouth, abnormalities
in liver blood tests,

659
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,680
diarrhea, hair thinning or loss,

660
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,510
vomiting, rash, and loss of appetite.

661
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:04,290
Corey calls it her new normal
because a lot has changed

662
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:08,280
but a lot hasn't; ask
your doctor about Ibrance,

663
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,210
the number one prescribed,
FDA approved, oral combination

664
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:14,579
treatment for HR+, HER2- MBC.

665
00:29:14,579 --> 00:29:17,150
(engaging music)

666
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:19,150
- If there's one thing
that President Trump does

667
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:24,150
consistently it's provide
compliments usually, to himself.

668
00:29:26,853 --> 00:29:28,610
As he was in a recent interview

669
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,223
with Fox News' Tucker Carlson.

670
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,819
- A lot of people gave me
a lot of credit for that.

671
00:29:33,819 --> 00:29:34,652
- The public was on your side for sure.

672
00:29:34,652 --> 00:29:36,920
- A lot of people said that was
a great presidential moment.

673
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,600
I won, they were totally
against me, I won.

674
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,030
I have millions and millions
of people on Twitter.

675
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,640
A poll just came out
today, I'm at 54 or 55

676
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,327
and they do say you can add
to whatever poll I have.

677
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:50,483
And yet I won and I'll win again.

678
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,753
- They do?

679
00:29:52,753 --> 00:29:54,880
That interview was taped
during Trump's trip to Asia,

680
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,610
a trip that made history when he became

681
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:59,430
the first sitting president
to step into North Korea.

682
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:02,010
Whether that moment will
result in meaningful diplomacy

683
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:03,840
is still unclear but the President

684
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,010
already thinks that it did.

685
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:06,730
He told reporters that his presidency

686
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:09,560
was quote, the hottest show in town.

687
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,600
The New York Times Peter Baker wrote about

688
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,319
the President's quest for
superlatives, saying whatever

689
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:17,360
he is doing must be the first, the most,

690
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,910
the biggest and it
shapes his policy choices

691
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:23,030
even as he frames his own
narrative with the branding skills

692
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,500
of a career in business and entertainment.

693
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,890
And joining me now is New York Times

694
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:28,030
Chief White House correspondent

695
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:31,500
and MSNBC political analyst, Peter Baker.

696
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,100
Peter, I just saw your
tweet a couple minutes

697
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,840
before we came on the
air that in the course

698
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,130
of one news conference the
President used best nine times,

699
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:42,860
incredible 16 times, tremendous 28 times,

700
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:46,000
and great or greatest 50 times.

701
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,330
Kudos to whoever actually went through

702
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:49,483
and actually counted
up all of those words.

703
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:53,040
But the reality here is
sometimes he'll make statements

704
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:56,050
that are simply not
true in in the interest

705
00:30:56,050 --> 00:31:00,653
of presenting himself in the
way that you write about.

706
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:03,300
- Yeah look, this is a salesman.

707
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:06,650
This is what his history
is, he's an entertainer

708
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:09,820
and I think he understands that repetition

709
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:14,820
and upselling in effect works,
and if facts are inconvenient

710
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:17,920
or get in the way you
just either ignore them

711
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:21,360
or rewrite them, and in this
case he has the best economy

712
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,670
ever, he's the strongest president ever,

713
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:26,780
the best negotiation
ever, the best deal ever,

714
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:30,450
and this has an impact,
it does in fact create

715
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:35,010
a narrative out there that
a lot of people appreciate,

716
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:37,750
and understand, and
agree with even if others

717
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:40,920
are spitting mad because he's playing

718
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:44,021
fast and loose with the facts.

719
00:31:44,021 --> 00:31:47,190
He clearly wants to be
in the history books.

720
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:49,990
This is one of the reasons
why he goes to the DMZ

721
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:52,340
and he walks across that
line into North Korea

722
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,610
because he was told no other
president had done it before.

723
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:55,443
It's a first.

724
00:31:55,443 --> 00:31:57,280
He likes to be somebody
who's done the first.

725
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,400
He likes to be someone
who's broken a barrier

726
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,110
and done something that
no one else has done.

727
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,670
The question, you just put it correctly,

728
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,960
is does this mean something more enduring?

729
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,331
And that's the unanswered question.

730
00:32:08,331 --> 00:32:12,620
- In that interview with Tucker
Carlson, Peter, first of all

731
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:16,030
I people thought it was
interesting shall we say

732
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,870
that Carlson was on the trip acting

733
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:21,020
as a de facto foreign
policy advisor while his own

734
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,370
National Security Advisor
was off in Mongolia.

735
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:26,880
But setting that aside
there were some interesting,

736
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,620
interesting shall we say answers to some

737
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,330
of the question that Carlson posed.

738
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:34,500
I wanna show you his answer
on homelessness specifically

739
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,503
and then we'll talk about
it, let's take a look.

740
00:32:38,026 --> 00:32:39,066
- In New York City, San
Francisco, Los Angeles

741
00:32:39,066 --> 00:32:41,833
they've got a major problem with--

742
00:32:41,833 --> 00:32:42,666
- It's very sad.

743
00:32:42,666 --> 00:32:43,499
- [Carlson] With filth.

744
00:32:43,499 --> 00:32:44,877
- Very sad.

745
00:32:44,877 --> 00:32:45,900
- Why is that?

746
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:49,730
- It's a phenomemon that
started two years ago.

747
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:51,720
It's disgraceful.

748
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,820
I'm gonna maybe and I'm
looking at it very seriously.

749
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,700
I had a situation when
I first became president

750
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,120
where we had certain
areas of Washington D.C.

751
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,090
where that was starting to happen

752
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:03,380
and I ended it very quickly.

753
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,380
I said you can't do that.

754
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,100
When we have leaders of the world coming

755
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,070
into to see the President
of the United States

756
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:11,700
and they're riding down a
highway they can't be looking

757
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,300
at that, I really believe
that it hurts our country.

758
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:18,450
- So Peter, not only is he
saying in another example

759
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:20,660
of this phenomenon where
he solves all the problems

760
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,059
and does all of the
things, he says he removed

761
00:33:22,059 --> 00:33:25,280
homeless people so that other
leaders wouldn't see them,

762
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,820
but he also says this is a phenomenon

763
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,370
that only started two years ago.

764
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:29,623
Where did that come from?

765
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:32,870
- Yeah, we've been trying
to figure that out today

766
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:36,340
as a matter of fact,
we've been scouring Fox

767
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,380
and some of the other places
he gets his information from

768
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,430
to see if he's reacting
to something specific

769
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:42,590
and it hard to understand
exactly, obviously

770
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:44,660
homelessness did not
just start two years ago.

771
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:47,330
There's no question that
there's been an uptick

772
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:49,530
in some places and in fact California

773
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:50,530
has been dealing with this.

774
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:52,390
I think it's been a big
issue in the last few weeks

775
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:53,840
in Los Angeles in particular.

776
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:58,840
But he sees not as a humanitarian
issue, the way he frames

777
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:02,190
it in that interview as well,
it's a public relations issue.

778
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:03,920
It's an issue you don't
world leaders to see

779
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:07,160
and therefore you wanna to get
these people out of the way,

780
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:10,170
not to make sure that they're
getting care or get them

781
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:12,520
into homes but to make sure
that they're not visible

782
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,830
for visiting leaders; that's a pretty

783
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:17,100
striking framework on his part.

784
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,420
But I don't know what he's talking about.

785
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,840
He says two years ago there was an issue

786
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,700
and he snaps his fingers
and suddenly it's gone.

787
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,635
I live in Washington,
lived here my whole life.

788
00:34:23,635 --> 00:34:25,690
It's hard to know what he's talking about

789
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:27,970
because obviously homelessness
has been an issue here

790
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:30,670
for a long time, hasn't
changed specifically

791
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:33,010
in the last two years in a meaningful way.

792
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:34,580
- If anything it's gotten to be

793
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,780
one of more visible problems.

794
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,610
Peter Baker, thank you very much.

795
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,157
Also I would be remiss
if I didn't thank you

796
00:34:40,157 --> 00:34:41,970
for that Western liberalism question

797
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:44,290
during the news conference;
we were all a little

798
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,090
taken aback by the
President's interpretation

799
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:48,210
of your question but thank
you for asking it sir

800
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:50,571
and thank you for being here today.

801
00:34:50,571 --> 00:34:51,404
- Okay, thanks very much.

802
00:34:51,404 --> 00:34:54,300
- As the field of Democratic
presidential candidates

803
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,100
prepare for the next
debate, climate change

804
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:00,150
remains a top issue among primary voters.

805
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:02,350
But how does a country
balance concerns over

806
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,360
the environment with the need for jobs

807
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:07,030
and revenue from industries like coal?

808
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:11,230
NBC's Cal Perry traveled
to Montana to find out.

809
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:13,860
Cal this is really the
central question as we try

810
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:16,920
to grapple with this as a country,

811
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,620
and as we frankly fail to
grapple with this as a country,

812
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,580
is there are a lot of people who depend

813
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:24,880
on these old industries
for their livelihoods

814
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,530
and making that transition
is incredibly difficult.

815
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:28,980
You talked to one
candidate who didn't make

816
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,630
the debate stage about all of this, right?

817
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:32,530
- Yeah, exactly right and
you're nailing the issue.

818
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:35,240
It's a difficult balance
especially in a place like Montana.

819
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,260
We went out there, we
spent time with governor,

820
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,640
Governor Bullock, he's trying to do that,

821
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,143
walk that fine line in an
industry and in a state

822
00:35:42,143 --> 00:35:44,300
that still relies on fossil fuels.

823
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,323
Take a look.

824
00:35:45,323 --> 00:35:48,300
(engaging music)

825
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:52,220
- I'm just absolutely amazed
at the big open skies.

826
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,410
- Everything that we're seeing around us

827
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:55,450
is just absolutely beautifully carved.

828
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:57,060
- One of the reasons I
wanted to come here was

829
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,060
just enjoy the park, but then tell people

830
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,420
that this place matters.

831
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:04,590
- These places are set aside
to be, because they're special.

832
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:07,600
These places are changing
and they're changing fast.

833
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,520
- It's gorgeous and you're

834
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,010
worried about the receding glaciers.

835
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:14,190
- While temperatures are
on the rise across America

836
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:16,800
Montana is warming twice as fast.

837
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,690
That according to the government's
own climate assessment.

838
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:22,240
The state is home to tiny coal towns

839
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,010
which historically have provided

840
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:26,780
the Western United States
with its energy needs,

841
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:29,570
small towns that are now
fighting for survival,

842
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:31,090
fighting in a state that also

843
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:34,580
has the nation's most
treasured natural wonders.

844
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:37,150
Anytime you're talking
about climate and politics

845
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:39,190
in America and Glacier National Park

846
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:41,030
has to be apart of that conversation.

847
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,750
According to the National Park Services

848
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:46,820
there were estimated 150
glaciers here in 1850.

849
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,673
Today, there's only 25.

850
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:52,750
Fewer days below freezing and more days

851
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:55,520
above 90 degrees is changing the state.

852
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,960
Less snowfall and earlier melt each year

853
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,800
means more fires, they're
bigger and burning longer.

854
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,190
Professor Diana Six studies
the impact of forest fires.

855
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,600
- This is naturally a fire landscape.

856
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,050
So it should be burning.

857
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:12,310
It's just that we're
seeing a lot of fires now.

858
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:14,100
- Dan Fagre measures the disappearing

859
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,670
glaciers for the U.S. Geological Survey.

860
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,240
Because of climate change his field

861
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,420
of study is naturally widening.

862
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,430
- When you have changes
like this they tend

863
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:24,440
to cascade through the whole system

864
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,180
and so the same things that
are melting the glaciers

865
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,580
are also causing changes

866
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,420
in forest fire frequency and severity.

867
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,770
- [Bullock] The current
administration says hell

868
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:34,890
they don't lose sleep about this.

869
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:36,130
I certainly do.

870
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:38,140
- [Cal] Montana governor
Steve Bullock is trying

871
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,260
to find a way to balance the realities

872
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,440
of climate change in a state with

873
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,420
an energy industry that depends on coal.

874
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,070
All the while doing it while running

875
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:49,970
for president inside the Democratic Party.

876
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:52,078
- As we make transitions we can't

877
00:37:52,078 --> 00:37:54,490
be leaving communities behind.

878
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:57,750
There are folks, they've
worked their whole life

879
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:00,220
powering this country, and at times

880
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:03,460
Democrats and others try to
make them into the villains.

881
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:06,480
- For small towns like
Colstrip, Montana any discussion

882
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,740
of climate change is really gonna

883
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,300
be a discussion about revenue and jobs.

884
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,810
The plant behind me is within city limits.

885
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:15,310
Between that and the coal
mine officials here say

886
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:18,863
it accounts for 90% of the town's revenue.

887
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:22,120
Two buildings at Colstrip Power Plant

888
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,170
in operation since the mid-70s

889
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:27,580
will shut down just a
week after Christmas.

890
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:30,830
- They're gonna see a
drop in revenue locally.

891
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:33,660
- [Cal] Lori Shaw is a
former city council member.

892
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:36,250
She's also the founder of Colstrip United,

893
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:38,460
a pro-coal advocacy group.

894
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:43,460
- When a town, a state, a
community is wholly reliant

895
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:46,560
on only one or two industries
that makes us vulnerable

896
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,600
and I think we should always be looking

897
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,093
for ways to diversify and
become more resilient.

898
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:56,170
- Even while faced with
certain economic collapse

899
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:58,360
many here want people outside Montana

900
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:01,250
to know they understand
the difficult balance.

901
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:04,434
- We're not just like a bunch
of nature hating monsters.

902
00:39:04,434 --> 00:39:07,530
We have our lives here
and we have families.

903
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:10,710
- I believe that we need to
have a beautiful environment

904
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:13,770
but what people don't get
is coal got us where we are.

905
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:15,230
- Climate change is real.

906
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:17,220
We might not be leaving anything

907
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,890
for our children or grandchildren
if we're not careful.

908
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:22,180
So we have to address it.

909
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:25,260
- We gotta address climate
change and we gotta do it now

910
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:28,290
and we actually are at
the point now as a country

911
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:31,387
where maybe it was lip
service 30 years ago,

912
00:39:31,387 --> 00:39:34,800
but if were not taking
immediate and durable action now

913
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,650
the America that we're
gonna give and the world

914
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:38,640
that we're gonna give to
our kids and grandkids

915
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,429
isn't gonna be the America we live in.

916
00:39:40,429 --> 00:39:41,907
(dramatic music)

917
00:39:41,907 --> 00:39:44,750
- Kasie, the Trump administration
not only doesn't wanna

918
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,650
have this conversation,
they're actively trying

919
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:48,840
to prevent people from
having the conversation

920
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,170
including people that work
for the U.S. government.

921
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:53,640
For the Democrat's part,
the DNC has said they're not

922
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,070
gonna have a stand alone
debate on climate change.

923
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:58,770
However, as Rachel Maddow
would say, watch this space

924
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:00,670
because we understand they're
now re-discussing that

925
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,070
and there could be a vote in August.

926
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:03,530
So we may have some kind of

927
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:05,993
a climate change forum
on the horizon Kasie.

928
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,073
- It'll be interesting
to see if they do decide

929
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:10,221
that this something that deserves,

930
00:40:10,221 --> 00:40:12,790
they received a lot of criticism I think

931
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:15,510
for saying, hey we can't spend
an entire evening talking

932
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:17,340
about this when of course
it's something that is just

933
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,040
gonna so dramatically affect all of us.

934
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,857
Cal Perry, thank you very
much for your reporting.

935
00:40:20,857 --> 00:40:25,250
It looked like a fantastic,
beautiful trip to Montana.

936
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:27,570
Coming up next a tennis prodigy takes down

937
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:31,040
a tennis titan who happens to be her idol.

- [Presenter] It's only a matter of time

941
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,920
until your check engine light comes on

942
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,630
or worse yet your car needs repair.

943
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:43,200
That could mean a big
surprise auto repair bill.

944
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,440
Those repairs are more
expensive than ever.

945
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,070
A new engine can be over $5000.

946
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:50,580
A new transmission over $4000.

and you can't pay for it get it fixed.

970
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:46,430
- [Presenter] Here's how
CarShield works: when your car

971
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:49,010
needs repair you take it
to your favorite mechanic

972
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:52,500
or even your dealer and CarShield
gets them paid directly.

973
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,240
That's why CarShield is America's

977

1000
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:03,223
- [Man] Mr. Goodson.

1001
00:43:03,223 --> 00:43:05,370
- Not enough shelter for
us people on the street.

1002
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:07,440
- Who is us?

1003
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,820
- So now's probably not a great

1004
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,520
time to get my library card.

1005
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,923
- I am not prepared to be
in a standoff with a cop.

1006
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,653
- [Man] Why do all this, for what?

1007
00:43:17,653 --> 00:43:19,055
- To let 'em know we still matter.

1008
00:43:19,055 --> 00:43:21,260
(engaging music)

1009

(engaging thing)

1016
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,340
- One More Thing before we go.

1017
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:41,650
Meet Cori Coco Gauff.

1018
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:43,660
She's 15 years old.

1019
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:46,240
Born in Atlanta she started
playing tennis at the age

1020
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,050
of seven, inspired by who else,

1021
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:51,240
Venus and Serena Williams.

1022
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,340
After noticing that she had
a knack for it on the court

1023
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,550
her family moved to Florida to give her

1024
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,990
better opportunities to train.

1025
00:43:57,990 --> 00:44:00,440
By the time she was 11 she had the chance

1026
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:03,080
to train with Serena
Williams' coach in France

1027
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:07,010
and by 14 she had won her
first match as a professional.

1028
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:10,510
Just a few months later she
was signed by New Balance.

1029
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:13,860
Despite achieving so much
in her 15 short years

1030
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:18,260
nothing could've prepared
her for what was to come.

1031
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:22,080
First, came Friday when Coco
became the youngest person

1032
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:26,100
to qualify for the main draw at Wimbledon.

1033
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:28,278
She said right afterward that she hoped

1034
00:44:28,278 --> 00:44:31,910
that maybe she could play
against one of her idols.

1035
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:34,470
So then came yesterday.

1036
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:36,810
She took the court at
Wimbledon and on the other side

1037
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:41,490
of the net, seven time Grand
Slam champion Venus Williams.

1038
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:45,590
Coco's dream come true taking
on one of the few very women

1039
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:49,290
who inspired her to pick up
a racket in the first place.

1040
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:52,210
There they were, the
youngest at Wimbledon, Coco,

1041
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:55,290
versus the eldest at
Wimbledon, Venus Williams,

1042
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:58,890
39 years old, no one and I mean no one

1043
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:02,858
could've predicted what this
15 year old would do next.

1044
00:45:02,858 --> 00:45:05,441
(ball thwacks)

1045
00:45:08,138 --> 00:45:10,721
(crowd cheers)

1046
00:45:13,195 --> 00:45:15,626
- [Announcer] A standing ovation.

1047
00:45:15,626 --> 00:45:18,543
Coco Gauff conquers Venus Williams.

1048
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,720
- Just unbelievable.

1049
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,840
Coco becoming the
youngest player since 1991

1050
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:27,760
to win in the first round
of the women's tournament,

1051
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,310
a rising star taking down
a titan in straight sets.

1052
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:36,110
Coco, overcome with emotion
as you would expect,

1053
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:39,550
her parents beaming with
pride from the stands.

1054
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:41,700
So what does a teen star tell her idol

1055
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:44,233
after besting her in
front of the whole world?

1056
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:48,040
- After the match I told her
just thank you for everything

1057
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:51,033
she did, I wouldn't be
here if it wasn't for her.

1058
00:45:52,143 --> 00:45:54,820
- Indeed, a fun fact for you you.

1059
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:57,013
In 2004, the year that Coco--
