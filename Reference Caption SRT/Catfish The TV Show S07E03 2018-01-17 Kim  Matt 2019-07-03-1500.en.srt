- [Max] All right we're back.

54
00:01:24,821 --> 00:01:26,773
- [Nev] So yesterday we did some research.

55
00:01:26,773 --> 00:01:27,743
- We don't know what to make of this.

56
00:01:27,743 --> 00:01:30,585
- We're a little befuddled.

57
00:01:30,585 --> 00:01:32,539
Okay so here's where we started.

58
00:01:32,539 --> 00:01:35,467
So the first thing we found,
we searched his number, bingo.

59
00:01:35,467 --> 00:01:36,300
- Look what we got.

60
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,778
Number for five years,
comes back to a Matt

61
00:01:38,778 --> 00:01:39,611
(beep)

62
00:01:39,611 --> 00:01:40,831
- This never happens.

63
00:01:40,831 --> 00:01:42,292
He's in Florida where he says he lives.

64
00:01:42,292 --> 00:01:44,067
So this was kind of a--

65
00:01:44,067 --> 00:01:44,900
- Good.

66
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:45,819
- Surprise.

67
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:47,719
And he also has a Twitter.

68
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:49,958
Then there's some pictures back from 2012

69
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:52,458
that look like they're of him.

70
00:01:53,426 --> 00:01:55,880
This would have been the Matt that you

71
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,204
sort of started talking to.

72
00:01:57,204 --> 00:01:59,105
(dramatic music)

73
00:01:59,105 --> 00:02:01,416
- Then we looked up his URL.

74
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:03,681
- We actually got a bunch of hits.

75
00:02:03,681 --> 00:02:06,004
The first one was this.

76
00:02:06,004 --> 00:02:08,407
A PlentyOfFish account that's up,

77
00:02:08,407 --> 00:02:10,592
I don't know how or
when it was last active.

78
00:02:10,592 --> 00:02:12,705
For a guy who lives in Kissimmee.

79
00:02:12,705 --> 00:02:13,542
- 21 years old.
- This is.

80
00:02:13,542 --> 00:02:14,878
- Six foot two.

81
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:17,195
There's also this photo.

82
00:02:17,195 --> 00:02:18,528
It could be him.

83
00:02:22,323 --> 00:02:24,656
(sad music)

84
00:02:30,937 --> 00:02:34,854
- I'm not sure if I should
even make a comment.

85
00:02:38,746 --> 00:02:40,829
I'm not sure what to say.

86
00:02:44,428 --> 00:02:47,098
- What's, are you upset?

87
00:02:47,098 --> 00:02:47,931
I can't tell.

88
00:02:47,931 --> 00:02:49,662
- Do you mind if I take a second?

89
00:02:49,662 --> 00:02:50,876
- Sure.

90
00:02:50,876 --> 00:02:52,114
Yeah.

91
00:02:52,114 --> 00:02:53,741
Take as much time as you need.

92
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:56,408
(ominous music)

93
00:03:06,803 --> 00:03:07,636
- [Nev] You all right?

94
00:03:07,636 --> 00:03:08,469
- Mmmhmm.

95
00:03:11,568 --> 00:03:13,805
- [Nev] What was uh?

96
00:03:13,805 --> 00:03:17,817
- I just got really warm
and just overwhelmed.

97
00:03:17,817 --> 00:03:20,516
- [Nev] But like, good
excited warm overwhelmed?

98
00:03:20,516 --> 00:03:21,349
- Um yeah.

99
00:03:24,045 --> 00:03:25,337
- [Nev] Well that's good.

100
00:03:25,337 --> 00:03:27,636
- Like this turned out to
go better than I thought.

101
00:03:27,636 --> 00:03:30,053
So I'm completely speechless.

102
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:34,363
I hope that it's him.

103
00:03:38,091 --> 00:03:40,003
- [Nev] Take as much time as you need.

104
00:03:40,003 --> 00:03:41,001
I mean.

105
00:03:41,001 --> 00:03:42,463
- That's okay.

106
00:03:42,463 --> 00:03:43,678
- [Nev] But yeah I mean it is exciting.

107
00:03:43,678 --> 00:03:44,553
It's cool.

108
00:03:44,553 --> 00:03:46,803
I mean the guy seems legit.

109
00:03:49,836 --> 00:03:50,669
- [Max] Good?

110
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:51,502
- Mmhmm.

111
00:03:51,502 --> 00:03:52,335
- [Max] Regroup?

112
00:03:52,335 --> 00:03:53,168
- Yeah.

113
00:03:53,168 --> 00:03:54,955
She's got like a little overwhelmed

114
00:03:54,955 --> 00:03:57,666
because I think she figured
that this was gonna end

115
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:01,730
up being like a huge
embarrassing disaster.

116
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:02,630
Anyway.

117
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,366
Looks like this guy is in Florida.

118
00:04:04,366 --> 00:04:06,043
He's the right age.

119
00:04:06,043 --> 00:04:09,125
Just to be sure we went
through his Facebook posts

120
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,067
and we saw that there was one girl

121
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:13,001
who seemed to be like
a good friend of his.

122
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:16,050
So we reached out this girl Crystal.

123
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,486
Crystal does know him.

124
00:04:17,486 --> 00:04:22,486
She confirmed everything that
we assumed we knew about him.

125
00:04:22,987 --> 00:04:27,820
- She also said she thought
he had a girlfriend right now.

126
00:04:28,687 --> 00:04:33,020
- As far as you know is he
currently dating someone?

127
00:04:34,714 --> 00:04:35,690
- She wasn't sure.

128
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:40,690
But she did say she thought
he had a girlfriend right now.

129
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:43,229
But we talked to Nick, his brother.

130
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:48,078
Nick said that Matt is not
in a relationship right now.

131
00:04:48,078 --> 00:04:50,590
- [Nev] I mean at this point
we don't know what to believe.

It's a "Giant sized mega-movie."

155

175
00:06:37,206 --> 00:06:40,894
Work is really rewarding
and brutal on my skin.

176
00:06:40,894 --> 00:06:43,193
But knowing how I earned all that dirt

177
00:06:43,193 --> 00:06:45,082
is pretty empowering.

178

When I get home the
first thing I have to do

179

is use the Dove Beauty Bar
to get rid of all the junk.

180
00:06:49,522 --> 00:06:51,195

181
00:06:51,195 --> 00:06:54,447
by making it soft and nourished and clean.

182

- [Nev] Here's what we know.

238
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:42,380
Matt is a good-looking, young guy

239
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,540
from Florida who did live in California.

240
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,620
The only concern we have now is

241
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,890
why haven't you video-chatted.

242
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:50,680
Why hasn't he sent you
Snapchats of his face?

243
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,363
If he is real what's he not telling you?

244
00:08:53,363 --> 00:08:55,500
What're we missing?

245
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,530
- Just kinda wanna get
off the floor (laughs).

- So here was are.

248
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,990
We've got some questions
that we're trying to answer.

249
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,350
If you definitely wanna meet him

250
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,380
then we have to decide that right now

251
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,560
and figure out what that means

252
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,260
and how we wanna make that happen.

253
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,020
- I definitely wanna meet him

254
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:22,950
but I'm terrified of heights
and I'm terrified of planes

255
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:26,920
so unless there's a different
way to get there I can't.

256
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,230
- [Max] We can work with that.

257
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,400
- Why don't we see if he'll come here.

258
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,339
I'm gonna call this guy.

259
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:33,300
Okay.

260
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,040
Ooh I gotta show her this photo I forgot.

261
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,870
I forgot after we hung up with Crystal

262
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,703
she texted us a picture of them together.

263
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,200
Like a recent photo.

264
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,860
So that, there he is.

265
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,514
- [Max] What do you think of him?

266
00:09:47,514 --> 00:09:49,790
- Um well he's not ugly.

267
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,320
- I think he's stunning to be honest.

268
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,585
Just very handsome.

269
00:09:54,585 --> 00:09:56,422
- (laughs) Oh my god!

270
00:09:56,422 --> 00:09:57,830
- All right I'm gonna go call him.

271
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,813
- How do you feel?

272
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,403
- Nervous.

273
00:10:02,664 --> 00:10:05,160
(phone ringing)

274
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,130

275
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,770
- Yo is this Matt?

276
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:08,760
- [Matt] Yes.

277
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,730
- Hey how you doing?

278
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:12,780
My name is Nev from that show "Catfish."

279
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,350
I actually spoke to your brother earlier.

280
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:17,700
We're out here in Sacramento with Kim

281
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,700
and we were wondering if you
wanted to meet up with her.

282
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,710
- [Matt] But why would she call the show?

283
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:28,210
- She didn't actually write in to us

284
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,460
her friend Joe wrote in

285
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,270
and was concerned that maybe you weren't

286
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,210
who you said you were.

287
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:37,105
I think after five years
it'd be great for both of you

288
00:10:37,105 --> 00:10:40,370
just to meet up and see what happens

289
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,970
and kind of move forward.

290
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,190
- [Matt] But it's not that easy.

291
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,360
I just got a lot going on.

292
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,193
My brother got out of surgery.

293
00:10:46,193 --> 00:10:48,160
I just started a new job.

294
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,090
You know there's a lot,

295
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:51,963
there's a lot of factors in life.

296
00:10:51,963 --> 00:10:53,370
- Yeah I just don't get it.

297
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:55,290
Why isn't he sending pictures?

298
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,650
Why is he chickening out from meeting you?

299
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,080
Or lying about it?

300
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,263
Something is up.

301
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:04,030
- We could come to you but I
don't know if you know this

302
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:07,930
but Kim is sort of very afraid of flying.

303
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,980
If it was possible would you come to her?

304
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,270
- [Matt] I'll meet her.

305
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,600
I do wanna see her.

306
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,753
- Okay great this is good
we're making progress.

307
00:11:18,753 --> 00:11:19,586
- [Matt] All right.

308
00:11:19,586 --> 00:11:20,579
- I'll see you soon.

309
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,117
- [Matt] Okay.

310
00:11:22,117 --> 00:11:23,510
- All right, later.

311
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,343
- [Matt] Bye.

312
00:11:26,242 --> 00:11:27,075
(sighs)

313
00:11:27,075 --> 00:11:28,650
- All right so I talked to him.

314
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,040
He does wanna meet you.

315
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,920
I think we're gonna try and
get him on a plane tonight

316
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,890
so that you can meet up wit
him first thing in the morning.

317
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:34,970
- Wow.

318
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,535
Are you gonna be okay tonight?

319
00:11:36,535 --> 00:11:37,368
- Yeah.

320
00:11:37,368 --> 00:11:39,123
- [Max] You're gonna meet him tomorrow.

321
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,080
- [Nev] Hopefully we'll
get you some answers.

322
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,381
- Okay.

323
00:11:44,381 --> 00:11:45,710
- All right.

324
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:46,770
He's flying all the way out here

325
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:49,246
so just make sure you're
ready to talk to him.

326
00:11:49,246 --> 00:11:50,562
- Thank you.

327
00:11:50,562 --> 00:11:53,330
(dramatic music)

328
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,890
- She is a nervous nelly.

329
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:56,901
- I mean now I'm beginning to wonder

- [Both] Joe!

497
00:17:28,249 --> 00:17:29,470
- How're you guys doing?

498
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,420
- [Nev] We were hoping we'd
get a chance to meet you.

499
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,030
- [Joe] Kim actually called me last night

500
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,913
and she was like kind of panicked.

501
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:38,510
And she just like let me know that

502
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:41,850
there were some things that
she didn't tell you guys.

503
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:43,400
- Do you know what it is?

504
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,950
- Um yeah but it's like
it needs to come from her

505
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:49,323
cause it's not really my place to say.

506
00:17:52,194 --> 00:17:53,458
(dramatic music)

507
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,369
(door creaking)

508
00:17:55,369 --> 00:17:56,202
- Hey.
- Hey.

509
00:17:56,202 --> 00:17:57,035
- [Kim] Hey.

510
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:59,702
(ominous music)

511
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,043
- [Nev] Who's this?

512
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,082
- It's uh, our kid.

513
00:18:09,082 --> 00:18:11,581
(booming)

514
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:12,540
- What?

515
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,373
- Yeah.

516
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,910
- [Max] Wait you guys have a kid?

517
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,400
- Yeah.

518
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,100
I wasn't sure if Kim wanted to bring

519
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,370
her into the situation.

520
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:23,450
She didn't want to make
Norma known at any point.

521
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:24,611
- [Max] Norma?

522
00:18:24,611 --> 00:18:25,490
- Yes this is Norma.
- Okay.

523
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,433
- [Max] Pieces of the
puzzle are coming together.

524
00:18:27,433 --> 00:18:28,266
- [Nev] Hi!

525
00:18:28,266 --> 00:18:31,040
- After we moved in she got pregnant

526
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,610
and then we just didn't work out.

527
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,636
She hasn't actually--

528
00:18:34,636 --> 00:18:36,710
- He doesn't know that, Matt
doesn't know you have a kid.

529
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:37,543
- [Max] He doesn't know that.

530
00:18:37,543 --> 00:18:38,376
- Okay.

531
00:18:38,376 --> 00:18:40,620
- She did not let Matt know
because he told her some things

532
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,160
that like made her not
want to bring her up.

533
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:44,993
- [Nev] What?

534
00:18:44,993 --> 00:18:46,061
Like he doesn't like kids or?

535
00:18:46,061 --> 00:18:47,440
Doesn't wanna have kids?

536
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,610
- Yes exactly that.

537
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:49,790
- [Nev] Right.

538
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,898
- Doesn't like kids,
doesn't wanna have kids.

539
00:18:51,898 --> 00:18:52,731
- Mmmhmm.

540
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,810
- What do you then think of this guy

541
00:18:56,810 --> 00:19:00,610
who you know could be
a potential step father

542
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:03,150
to your kid who doesn't like kids and,

543
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,130
- [Nev] Lives in Florida.

544
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:05,790
- [Max] And doesn't send her pictures.

545
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,660
- You don't want her movin' to Florida.

546
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,493
- Oh no.

547
00:19:08,493 --> 00:19:09,379
No no no no.

548
00:19:09,379 --> 00:19:10,212
- [Max] Right.

549
00:19:10,212 --> 00:19:11,045
But you know that that's what

550
00:19:11,045 --> 00:19:13,279
they've been talking about right?

551
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,779
(air blowing)

552
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,440
- Just add that to the list.

553
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,100
This guy won't send you a picture,

554
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,270
doesn't like kids,
doesn't wanna have kids.

555
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:27,089
This is turning into more
and more of a bad idea Kim.

556
00:19:27,089 --> 00:19:29,422
(sad music)

557
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,716
- Daddy's gotta get you baby.

558
00:19:32,716 --> 00:19:34,240
(baby crying)

559
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,960
I'm just here to pick her up.

560
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,360
Y'all doing your thing.

561
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,193
- I love you.

562
00:19:38,193 --> 00:19:39,055
- Give kisses.

563
00:19:39,055 --> 00:19:39,888
(kissing)

564
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:42,170
Give knuckles to, give 'em knuckles.

565
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:45,310
- Hey, boo boo boo boo boo boo boo.

566
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,540
- [Joe] It was great to meet you guys.

567
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,430
- Yeah you too man.
- Later Joe.

568
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,763
- [Max] Oh wow okay.

569
00:19:52,449 --> 00:19:53,820
You're in trouble Kim.

570
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,820
- [Nev] So Matt doesn't
obviously know you had a kid.

571
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,380
- When I was pregnant and talking to him

572
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:02,610
I didn't get big until the very end

573
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:06,410
and at one point I was
actually supposed to come out

574
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:10,943
to see him but I went
into labor so I bailed.

575
00:20:12,349 --> 00:20:13,182
- Of course you bailed.

576
00:20:13,182 --> 00:20:14,284
- [Nev] Cause he was here
when you were pregnant.

577
00:20:14,284 --> 00:20:15,980
- Yeah.

578
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,970
- You know he doesn't care for kids.

579
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:20,330
Do you think he could be
a good father to Norma?

580
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:21,340
- I hope so.

581
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,060
I mean I've never met him so I don't know

582
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,020
exactly how he is in person.

583
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,540
- You really love this guy?

584
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,143
You really think Matt is
like a good fit for you?

585
00:20:30,234 --> 00:20:31,633
- Um I believe so.

586
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,150
- All right so it's all out there.

587
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,100
Matt's plane should have landed.

588
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:40,960
Let's meet at Discovery Park.

589
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,200
We've got a date!

590
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,033
- I'm ready.

591
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:43,866
- Are you?

592
00:20:43,866 --> 00:20:45,078
- I think so.

593
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:47,090
- Okay Mr. Matt.

594
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:50,113
- Guys how am I supposed
to tell him about my child?

595
00:20:51,527 --> 00:20:53,040
- You just gotta do it.

596
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,670
- Let's let him tell you first.

597
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,250
- He's gotta few things to answer.

598
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,570
We wanna know why he never
sent a picture of himself.

599
00:20:58,570 --> 00:20:59,430
- [Kim] Mhm.

600
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:02,420
Why he didn't make more of an effort

601
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,670
to see you when he was in Sacramento.

602
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:06,587
Right?

603
00:21:06,587 --> 00:21:07,420
- [Kim] Mhm.

604
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,090
We wanna know how he
really feels about you.

605
00:21:09,932 --> 00:21:11,480
- I mean if he's the person he says he is

606
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,904
why not just tell me who you are?

607
00:21:13,904 --> 00:21:16,000
- [Max] Maybe he's not
the guy in the pictures.

608
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,420
- The whole thing to me
just doesn't make any sense.

609
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:21,370
All right Discovery Park here it is.

610
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:22,319
Right here.

611
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:23,652
What I expected.

612
00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:27,170
(suspenseful music)

613
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:28,930
- [Max] All right fingers crossed.

614
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,598
- Oh.

615
00:21:30,598 --> 00:21:31,548
- [Max] Uh oh yeah.

616
00:21:32,452 --> 00:21:33,285
I see someone.

617
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:35,092
That could be him.

618
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,370
- I'm ready.
- It's time.

619
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:38,440
- [Nev] Face your fears.

620
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,323
Let's do this.

621
00:21:40,657 --> 00:21:42,743
(suspenseful music)

622
00:21:42,743 --> 00:21:44,220
Is this him?

623
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,270
- [Max] It's gotta be.

624
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:48,220
Who else would be here hiding
in the shade of a tree.

625
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,108
- Oh my goodness.

626
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:51,310
Oh (beep).

627
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,882

Just out of curiosity,
you got a girlfriend?

751

- No.

752
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,997
- Why no pictures of you?

753
00:26:28,997 --> 00:26:30,297
Why won't you send me any?

754
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,013
- I don't like being
in front of the camera.

- Okay but for five years
you've been talkin to this girl,

756
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,520
how do you not send her a little video?

757
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,323
Just so she knows it's you or something.

758
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:45,980
- You are who said you were,

759
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,420
you weren't lying about any of that.

760
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,940
So then what's the holdup?

761
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,573
- I'm a secretive person
for the most part.

762
00:26:56,020 --> 00:27:01,020
- I think the bigger question
is do you care about her?

763
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,270
- I do.

764
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,103
- In what way?

765
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:07,900
- Like it would suck if
something happened to her.

766
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,590
Like that's how I would feel.

767

768
00:27:12,117 --> 00:27:14,470
- I mean I care about you.

769

I mean I was there when your mom died.

You were there when my grandfather died.

hard to like brush off.

786
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,858

797
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:09,040
- Just let them be weird with each other.

798
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,290
Here it is, we made it happen,

799

(dramatic music)

801
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,900
- [Matt] Anything else you gotta ask?

802
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,293
- So do you still not like children?

803
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:24,360
- I mean it's iffy.

804
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,193
Why?

805
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,203
- Well I haven't really
been exactly honest.

806
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:36,008
I actually have an almost
two-year-old daughter.

807
00:28:36,008 --> 00:28:36,841
- Huh?

808
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:37,674
- [Kim] I have a child.

809
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:41,110
- And you decided now to tell me?

810
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:41,943
- Yes.

811
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,690
I mean like I get that I was lying

812
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,190
but can you really blame me?

813
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:49,163
Like you told me to begin
with you don't like children.

814
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:58,458
Which leads me to my next question.

815
00:28:58,458 --> 00:28:59,910
Would you like to be her godfather?

816
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:00,880
- Hold up.

817
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,430
I've never even met her.

818
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:04,180
I'm just now finding out about her.

819
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,080
A child.

820
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,300
Okay now my anxiety's through the roof.

821
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:14,593
- She didn't meet you when
you came to visit because?

822
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:18,652
- I bailed because I went into labor.

823
00:29:18,652 --> 00:29:21,402
(dramatic music)

824
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:30,240
- Kim why don't you tell
Matt how you feel about him.

825
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:32,350
- Do I have to do it with all of you guys?

826
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:36,190
- [Matt] There's a bench
over there if you wanna sit.

00:36:44,934 --> 00:36:45,767
(laughing)

995
00:36:45,767 --> 00:36:46,600
She loves it!

996
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,853
- [Matt] Knuckles.

997
00:36:47,853 --> 00:36:48,686
- [Max] Yep.

998
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,630
- Do you guys wanna go inside?

999
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,580
- Sure yeah.

1000
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,413
- Let's do it.

1001
00:36:57,447 --> 00:36:59,370
- Her dad'll probably be
coming to get her soon.

1002
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:00,560
- What do you think?

1003
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,527
Pretty cute.

1004
00:37:01,527 --> 00:37:02,360
- Yeah.

1005
00:37:09,883 --> 00:37:11,260
- [Nev] But you don't spend
a ton of time with kids?

1006
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,093
- Mm-mmm.

1007
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,380
- You're very, obviously,
not ready to like

1008
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,950
engage with a child.

1009
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:21,783
- Right.

1010
00:37:21,783 --> 00:37:22,662
- [Nev] That's cool.

1011
00:37:22,662 --> 00:37:23,495
(laughs)

1012
00:37:23,495 --> 00:37:24,437
(text dinging)

1013
00:37:24,437 --> 00:37:25,270
- [Nev] Is that Joe?

1014
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,103
- [Max] Go go Joe said.

1015
00:37:26,103 --> 00:37:27,131
- Yeah I gotta take her out.

1016
00:37:27,131 --> 00:37:29,609
- [Nev] There he is.

1017
00:37:29,609 --> 00:37:30,442
Hey.

1018
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,555
- Give mama kisses.

1019
00:37:32,555 --> 00:37:33,388
- Kisses.

1020
00:37:33,388 --> 00:37:34,470
- [Nev] That hair, look at
that hair, both of you guys

1021
00:37:35,352 --> 00:37:36,205
have quite, quite the head of hair.

1022
00:37:36,205 --> 00:37:37,129
All right, later Joe.

1023
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:37,962
- [Max] Bye Joe.

1024
00:37:37,962 --> 00:37:38,795
- [Nev] See ya Norma.

1025
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:43,880
Wanna get out of the house so
it's not so quiet and awkward.

1026
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,380
- [Kim] That would be nice.

1027
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,810
- [Nev] There's a place
nearby that has a nice

1028
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:49,040
like sort of outdoor space
where you guys could chill,

1029
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,210
have some ice cream and
like hang on your own.

1030
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,410
- [Kim] Sounds fine.

1031
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:53,243
- [Nev] All right cool.

1032
00:37:53,243 --> 00:37:55,710
So do your thing, hang
out, take your time.

1033
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,092
No kissing.

1034
00:37:57,092 --> 00:37:57,953
(laughing)

1035
00:37:57,953 --> 00:37:59,013
Or kissing's allowed sorry.

1036
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,467
- So you calm now?

1037
00:38:01,467 --> 00:38:03,893
- A little bit.

1038
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,850
- Where are we going from here?

1039
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:15,490
- Stop staring at me.

1040
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:17,755
- I'm just asking, where
are we going from here?

1041
00:38:17,755 --> 00:38:20,338
(gentle music)

1042
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,320
- Good question, you speak first.

1043
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,270
- To answer your question from earlier,

1044
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:29,720
the one that I keep avoiding,

1045
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:35,113
right now a relationship for
me is not the best place.

1046
00:38:36,256 --> 00:38:38,589
(sad music)

1047
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:47,140
But I've got no problem helping you out

1048
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,540
if you need help with Norma.

1049
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,090
I mean I'm okay with
being Norma's godfather.

1050
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:55,410
You know I do care about you

1051
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:56,243
as friends.

1052
00:38:59,768 --> 00:39:00,810
I mean as long as I have you in my life

1053
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:01,788
that's all that matters.

1054
00:39:01,788 --> 00:39:04,371
(techno music)

1055
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,290
- [Max] So where're you
guys gonna leave it?

1056
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:11,190
- [Matt] As friends.

1057
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,846
- I guess this is goodbye for now.

1058
00:39:12,846 --> 00:39:13,679
- Yup.

1059
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:14,512
- Good to meet you.

1060
00:39:14,512 --> 00:39:15,345
- Same.

1061
00:39:15,345 --> 00:39:16,389
- Thanks for coming up here.

1062
00:39:16,389 --> 00:39:18,139
- I guess till I see you next time.

1063
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:24,320
- [Max] All right.

1064
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,623
- Well that was weird.

1065
00:39:26,623 --> 00:39:27,600
(laughing)

1066
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,363
But also heartwarming.

1067
00:39:34,712 --> 00:39:37,379
(Skype ringing)

1068
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:39,143
- [Both] Hey!

1069
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:41,143
- Hey.

1070
00:39:41,143 --> 00:39:41,976
- Give us a little update.

1071
00:39:41,976 --> 00:39:43,620
What's been going on with you?

1072
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:44,503
Tell us everything.

1073
00:39:44,503 --> 00:39:48,170
- Just going to school,
working and being a mommy.

1074
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:49,990
- You weren't going to school
when we met you were you?

1075
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:53,710
- [Kim] No I started
taking online classes.

1076
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:56,304
- That's great, what're
you studying for or toward?

1077
00:39:56,304 --> 00:39:57,680
- I'm going for a surgeon.

1078
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,953
- Surgeon? Wow!
