Room with Wolf Blitzer,

27
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,323
tomorrow at 5:00 eastern on CNN.

28
00:01:17,696 --> 00:01:20,446
(dramatic music)

29
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,107
- And welcome back to
this very special night at

30
00:01:27,107 --> 00:01:30,040
St. Anselm College in
Manchester, New Hampshire.

31
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,390
I'm Anderson Cooper.

32
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:33,080
We are just getting started with our

33
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,890
CNN Democratic presidential
town hall event.

34
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,840
In the last hour, you heard
from Senator Amy Klobuchar.

35
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,510
And later tonight, you'll
see town halls with

36
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,910
Senators Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris,

37
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,180
and Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

38
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,140
Right now, Senator Elizabeth
Warren of Massachusetts.

39
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,620
Now, to pull this event off tonight,

40
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,580
CNN has partnered with
Harvard University's

41
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,170
Institute of Politics,

42
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,470
which has just released
its youth poll examining

43
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,254
the political opinions of young Americans.

44
00:01:57,254 --> 00:01:59,720
And also with the New
Hampshire Institute of Politics

45
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,190
right here at Saint Anselm College.

46
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,530
Throughout, the night the
candidates will take questions

47
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,700
from these young college
students and young adults who are

48
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,141
in the auditorium who
say they plan to vote in

49
00:02:09,141 --> 00:02:11,980
their state's Democratic
primaries and caucuses.

50
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,483
So, please welcome to the
stage, Senator Elizabeth Warren.

51
00:02:17,076 --> 00:02:21,443
(audience applauds and cheers)

52
00:02:21,443 --> 00:02:24,500
Welcome.
- Hi, it's good to see you.

53
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,818
(audience applauds and cheers)

54
00:02:27,818 --> 00:02:28,651
- Hi.

55
00:02:30,507 --> 00:02:31,340
All right.

56
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,173
- You want to have a seat?

57
00:02:32,173 --> 00:02:33,590
- Are we going to do students?

58
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,423
- Let's go right to it.

59
00:02:34,423 --> 00:02:35,570
- In that case, I want closer.

60
00:02:36,564 --> 00:02:38,020
Have to keep an eye on the
ones in the back, oaky.

61
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,360
- I want to start with
your big announcement today

62
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,259
about college affordability.

63
00:02:41,259 --> 00:02:43,555
Obviously, it could impact
a lot of students here.

64
00:02:43,555 --> 00:02:46,650
For that, I want to bring in
Dena Miller from Massachusetts.

65
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,379
She's a junior at St. Anselm
College studying history, Dena.

66
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:51,550
- Hi, Dena.
- Hi, Senator.

67
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,930
I like so many other students
had to take out loans

68
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,980
to pay for my education that I
will be paying off for years.

69
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,830
What is your plan to
deal with student debt

70
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,940
and the rising cost of education?

71
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,680
- Okay, thanks for the question, Dena.

72
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,306
You know, this is the
America we live in now.

73
00:03:05,306 --> 00:03:09,550
Basically to get a shot
at a middle class life,

74
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:13,760
you've got to have some post
high school technical training,

75
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,420
two-year college, four-year
college, maybe graduate school,

76
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,667
depending on who you are and
what you're ending up doing.

77
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:21,120
The position of the federal
government has been,

78
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,835
good luck to you, you're on your own.

79
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:26,226
The one thing they've done
is they've lent tens of

80
00:03:26,226 --> 00:03:28,650
thousands, hundreds of
thousands, millions,

81
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,880
billions of dollars to our students.

82
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,680
And it is now crushing them.

83
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,894
So, my proposal is to
say, this isn't right.

84
00:03:36,894 --> 00:03:40,910
What we have to do as a
country is roll back that debt.

85
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:44,003
And so, I have two parts to the proposal.

86
00:03:44,003 --> 00:03:49,003
Part one is that we say that
we're going to roll back

87
00:03:50,407 --> 00:03:55,407
student loan debt for about
95% of students who have debt.

88
00:03:57,721 --> 00:03:59,670
That's part one.

89
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:04,280
And part two is to make sure
that we never get in this mess

90
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,360
again on student loan debt
and that is to make college

91
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,534
universally available with
free tuition and fees,

92
00:04:12,534 --> 00:04:15,510
and to put more money into Pell grants

93
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:18,230
so that students of color,
so that our poorest students

94
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:22,379
have real access to college
and that we put real money

95
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:26,252
into our historically black
colleges and universities.

96
00:04:26,252 --> 00:04:29,742
This is about opportunity for everyone.

97
00:04:29,742 --> 00:04:32,590
(audience applauds)

98
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,760
And can we talk about how to pay for it?

99
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,203
- I was just about to ask for it.

100
00:04:36,203 --> 00:04:37,036
- Just for a minute, you want to ask?

101
00:04:37,036 --> 00:04:38,321
- Well, that is the criticism
obviously from Republicans

102
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:39,985
who say how you're going to
pay for it, and even from

103
00:04:39,985 --> 00:04:42,413
centrist Democrats who say
doesn't this feed the narrative

104
00:04:42,413 --> 00:04:45,900
that Democrats want to give
everything away for free.

105
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,160
- So, let's remember
where this all started.

106
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,620
I started several months
ago about a wealth tax,

107
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,120
an ultra millionaire's tax.

108
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,314
It's 2 cents on every dollar of

109
00:04:57,314 --> 00:05:00,990
the great fortunes above $50 million.

110
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:05,570
So, your 50 millionth and
first dollar, you've got to pay

111
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:09,800
2 cents and 2 cents on all
of the dollars after that.

112
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,058
And here's the stunning part.

113
00:05:12,058 --> 00:05:16,323
If we ask the great fortunes
in this country, understand,

114
00:05:16,323 --> 00:05:19,230
this isn't about trying to be nasty

115
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,300
or say you've done anything wrong,

116
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,304
what it's about is saying,
look, you had a great idea.

117
00:05:24,304 --> 00:05:25,830
You got out there.

118
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:30,313
You worked hard or you inherited
well, whichever one it was.

119
00:05:31,307 --> 00:05:35,224
(audience applauds and cheers)

120
00:05:39,514 --> 00:05:42,209
But now that you've
got that great fortune,

121
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:46,540
spend just a minute to
remember how you got it.

122
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,556
You built that great business
or your ancestors did

123
00:05:49,556 --> 00:05:54,110
using workers that all of
us helped pay to educate.

124
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,200
You got your goods to market using roads

125
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,130
and bridges that all of
us helped pay to build.

126
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:03,050
You are protected in your
factories with firefighters

127
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,880
and police officers that
all of us helped to pay.

128
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,457
And we say, good for you,

129
00:06:08,457 --> 00:06:12,884
that you have now gotten this
great fortune, but 2 cents.

130
00:06:12,884 --> 00:06:15,208
You've got to pay something back

131
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,300
so everybody else gets a chance.

132
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,339
And here's how the money works out.

133
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:23,920
If we put that 2 cent
wealth tax in place on the

134
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:28,920
75,000 largest fortunes
in this country, 2 cents,

135
00:06:29,372 --> 00:06:34,372
we can do universal child care
for every baby zero to five,

136
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:39,628
universal pre-K, universal
college and knock back the

137
00:06:39,842 --> 00:06:43,950
student loan debt burden
for 95% of our students

138
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:47,103
and still have nearly a
trillion dollars left over.

139
00:06:48,122 --> 00:06:52,725
(audience applauds and cheers)

140
00:06:52,725 --> 00:06:53,558
Yeah.

141
00:06:55,213 --> 00:06:56,387
- I want you to,

142
00:06:56,387 --> 00:06:59,010
this is actually kind of related.

143
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:01,100
I want you to meet Meghan
McCormick from Pennsylvania.

144
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:01,933
- Hi, Meghan.

145
00:07:01,933 --> 00:07:04,917
- She's a graduate, you
got to listen to this,

146
00:07:04,917 --> 00:07:06,490
she's a graduate student
at Harvard and MIT.

147
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,720
She's also a contributor
at Forbes, where she covers

148
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,147
women running high impact
organizations in Africa.

149
00:07:11,147 --> 00:07:14,152
You make me feel like a shlub, I mean.

150
00:07:14,152 --> 00:07:15,060
(audience laughs)

151
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,600
- What do you do in
your spare time, Meghan?

152
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,210
It's good to see you.

153
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:19,770
- Thank you for being here.

154
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,700
So, Amazon's monopoly means that I

155
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,790
can buy generic goods and brand names from

156
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,280
my phone and receive them on my doorstep

157
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,106
without a delivery fee within 24 hours.

158
00:07:29,106 --> 00:07:32,220
How is breaking up big tech good for me?

159
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,312
- Okay, good question, Meghan.

160
00:07:34,312 --> 00:07:37,480
So, here's what we want
to remember about Amazon,

161
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,948
about Google, about Apple,

162
00:07:39,948 --> 00:07:43,210
about a lot of these giant tech companies.

163
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,810
They actually run two businesses.

164
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,920
So, one is the platform.

165
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,260
That's the place where people
come to buy and sell goods.

166
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,700
That's where you go to get
whatever it is, you know,

167
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,984
you can compare 48 printers

168
00:07:55,984 --> 00:07:59,120
and get it all delivered
in less than 24 hours.

169
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,953
Got it.

170
00:07:59,953 --> 00:08:01,130
Cool.

171
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,190
That's the platform.

172
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,901
Just so you get an idea of
the scale here for Amazon,

173
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:10,901
Walmart does about 9% of
all retail sales in America.

174
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:17,545
If you want to sell online,
Amazon is doing about 49%

175
00:08:17,545 --> 00:08:21,300
of all retail sales that
are happening in America.

176
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,400
So that is the marketplace.

177
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,280
So, Amazon runs the marketplace.

178
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,240
I'm cool with that.

179
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,260
I'm all for a marketplace.

180
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:32,020
But Amazon does a second
thing and that is they collect

181
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,917
information on every buyer
and seller who comes through.

182
00:08:34,917 --> 00:08:36,670
Every time you go to buy something,

183
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,570
they get your information
and they aggregate it

184
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,500
with the other information
they had about you.

185
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,898
Every time you come to sell
something, they get information.

186
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:47,498
And then they see that,
whoa, over there it looks

187
00:08:47,498 --> 00:08:52,498
like pet pillows is starting
to make a big profit.

188
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,227
Huh, says Amazon.

189
00:08:56,227 --> 00:08:57,996
I know what let's do.

190
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:02,819
Let's jump in front of pet
pillows and do Amazon pet pillows

191
00:09:02,819 --> 00:09:07,819
and move pet pillows from the
front page back to page 16.

192
00:09:10,053 --> 00:09:13,330
And the consequence is that Amazon,

193
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:15,760
because of its superior information,

194
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,330
can come in and knock out
all of the competition.

195
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:23,500
Now this is a real thing,
Meghan, that's happening.

196
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,666
And here's what we know
as a consequence of this,

197
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:31,058
is that the area around
these giants are referred to

198
00:09:31,058 --> 00:09:36,058
by venture capitalists,
investors, as the dead zone

199
00:09:36,439 --> 00:09:40,180
because it means you try
to start up a business,

200
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,890
you just run the risk that
Amazon steps in front of you

201
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:46,050
or Google steps in front of you

202
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:49,430
or they buy you out before you
have a chance to get started.

203
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,341
Look, here's how I see it.

204
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:55,533
You can run the platform,
that is, you can be the umpire

205
00:09:55,533 --> 00:09:58,922
in the baseball game and you
can run an honest platform,

206
00:09:58,922 --> 00:10:02,972
or you can be a player, that
is, you can have a business

207
00:10:02,972 --> 00:10:07,090
or you can have a team in the
game, but you don't get to

208
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:10,470
be the umpire and have a team in the game.

209
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:14,500
If we break off the
platform from the parts

210
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,335
that are competing, what
you'll see in America

211
00:10:17,335 --> 00:10:19,490
is a platform that works really well.

212
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,818
It's a very profitable business,
but you'll see a lot more

213
00:10:21,818 --> 00:10:25,010
competition where little businesses have a

214
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:27,916
chance to get going, where
when you've got a good idea

215
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:31,070
you can build that good
idea into something,

216
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:34,000
where there's really a chance for

217
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,100
everybody to get in and compete.

218
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,440
So that's the reason I want to see

219
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,477
the two of them broken apart.

220
00:10:38,477 --> 00:10:40,080
- Do you order stuff from Amazon?

221
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,613
- Sure.
- You do?

222
00:10:41,613 --> 00:10:43,626
What was the last thing
you ordered, do you know?

223
00:10:43,626 --> 00:10:45,252
- A mailbox.

224
00:10:45,252 --> 00:10:47,464
(audience laughs)

225
00:10:47,464 --> 00:10:48,852
- Okay.

226
00:10:48,852 --> 00:10:51,852
(audience applauds)

227
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,788
What did they put the mailbox
in when they deliver it?

228
00:10:58,788 --> 00:10:59,943
- It comes in a box.

229
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,593
It was a box of mailbox.

230
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,890
- We have another question now.

231
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:07,750
This is Seth Filo from Arizona.

232
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,471
He's a freshman at Harvard, a
supporter of Mayor Buttigieg.

233
00:11:10,471 --> 00:11:12,036
Seth?

234
00:11:12,036 --> 00:11:14,760
- Senator Warren, in 2012,

235
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,253
you opposed the legalization
of marijuana nationwide.

236
00:11:17,253 --> 00:11:20,460
And then in 2013, as
senator of Massachusetts,

237
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:23,010
you oppose the state
initiative for legalization.

238
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:26,030
Yet in 2016, you came out in support

239
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:28,340
of the legalization of
marijuana nationwide.

240
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,740
What are your honest views on the

241
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,143
legalization of marijuana
and marijuana legislation?

242
00:11:32,143 --> 00:11:35,270
And if they have, why have they changed?

243
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:38,050
- So, actually, I supported Massachusetts

244
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:40,207
changing its laws on marijuana.

245
00:11:40,207 --> 00:11:43,660
Massachusetts had
decriminalized at that point

246
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,100
and I thought it made a lot
more sense for Massachusetts

247
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,210
to go ahead and legalize marijuana,

248
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:52,730
and I now support the
legalization of marijuana.

249
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:56,910
And let me tell you at least
a couple of reasons why.

250
00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:00,688
The first one is, it's just
a plain old science reason.

251
00:12:00,688 --> 00:12:04,053
It makes no darn sense
that right now in America,

252
00:12:04,053 --> 00:12:08,392
we treat marijuana as a schedule 1 drug,

253
00:12:08,392 --> 00:12:12,010
which means in effect
the federal government

254
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:15,952
has determined in advance
that it has no medicinal use,

255
00:12:15,952 --> 00:12:18,190
that it can't have any good effects,

256
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,930
no research is supposed to be done.

257
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:21,690
It makes it very hard
to do research on it.

258
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:25,640
And that's just, we should
be doing this, right?

259
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,390
We should be looking into it.

260
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:31,790
But the second reason is
because of the racial impact

261
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:34,940
of the enforcement of marijuana laws.

262
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,100
You know, right now in this country,

263
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,280
the best evidence suggests
that African-Americans

264
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:45,235
and whites use marijuana
at about the same rates,

265
00:12:45,235 --> 00:12:48,640
and yet African-Americans
are far more likely to be

266
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,548
arrested for marijuana
use than whites are.

267
00:12:52,548 --> 00:12:55,330
So, every time we start to talk about

268
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:58,900
criminal justice reform, for
example, I think a good place

269
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:03,307
to start is with the things we
make illegal, and one of the

270
00:13:03,307 --> 00:13:07,850
best places we could start
is by legalizing marijuana.

271
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:11,520
- I want you to meet Jackson
Dwyer, he's from Massachusetts.

272
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,210
He's a senior at St. Anselm College.

273
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,043
Jackson?

274
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:14,876
- Hi, Jackson.

275
00:13:14,876 --> 00:13:15,709
- Hi, Senator.

276
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:17,540
You have often been a
vocal critic of police

277
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,840
and the criminal justice system,

278
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,670
both the state and the federal levels.

279
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:23,540
As a young Massachusetts voter
and aspiring police officer

280
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,090
who's lived through countless tragedies,

281
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,960
including the recent murders
of Sergeant Gannon of Yarmouth

282
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,430
and Officer Michael Chesna of Weymouth,

283
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,350
how can you assure me
that you will support

284
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,860
legislation that keeps
law enforcement safe?

285
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,800
- So that's a very good question.

286
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,300
I appreciate your asking it.

287
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,980
You know, I talk with a lot of
people in different parts of

288
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,453
the criminal justice system,

289
00:13:42,453 --> 00:13:44,540
people who are in law enforcement,

290
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,527
people who are in the judicial system,

291
00:13:46,527 --> 00:13:50,483
people when they are incarcerated,

292
00:13:53,978 --> 00:13:57,900
various parts of it, and what all of them

293
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,410
tell me is we've got a problem.

294
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:02,296
Our criminal justice system is broken.

295
00:14:02,296 --> 00:14:06,343
And right at the heart
of that problem is race.

296
00:14:06,343 --> 00:14:09,860
And we have to address this head on.

297
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,590
So let me just give you
some basic information about

298
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:15,350
what's happening right now in
our criminal justice system.

299
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:18,784
Study after study after
study shows us that

300
00:14:18,784 --> 00:14:22,797
African-Americans compared
with whites are more

301
00:14:22,797 --> 00:14:27,797
likely to be for exactly the same crimes,

302
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,580
they're more likely to be arrested,

303
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,498
they're more likely to be arraigned,

304
00:14:32,498 --> 00:14:35,234
they are more likely to be taken to trial.

305
00:14:35,234 --> 00:14:38,562
They are more likely to
be wrongfully convicted

306
00:14:38,562 --> 00:14:43,370
and they are more likely to
receive harsher sentences.

307
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:47,130
That is a criminal justice
system that is not only

308
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:51,070
locking up too many people, it
is a criminal justice system

309
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:54,030
that has a problem of race
right at the heart of it,

310
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,130
and we need to call it out for what it is.

311
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:00,770
(audience applauds)

312
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,880
No one is safer in a world where we

313
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,040
have a broken criminal justice system.

314
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,350
So let me just go through a couple

315
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,270
of the parts directly to your question.

316
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,640
I said on the first part,
one way we can help fix this

317
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,290
system is take a look at
what it is we make illegal.

318
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:20,530
How about the next part
in the judicial system?

319
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:23,914
We need to make sure that
everybody is entitled

320
00:15:23,914 --> 00:15:27,170
and gets good legal representation.

321
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,820
Throughout the system, we
want to make sure the right

322
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,970
people are incarcerated and
not the wrong people because

323
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,860
they couldn't afford to hire a lawyer.

324
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,972
Justice is not just
for those who are rich,

325
00:15:35,972 --> 00:15:37,810
justice is for everyone,

326
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,900
and the only way we're
gonna get that in America

327
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,020
is if we're able to put
the resources into it.

328
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,990
Third part of this is we should get

329
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:47,453
rid of for-profit private prisons.

330
00:15:47,453 --> 00:15:50,084
It is an outrage in America.

331
00:15:50,084 --> 00:15:53,167
(audience applauds)

332
00:15:56,506 --> 00:16:00,319
Fourth is that when people
leave the prison system,

333
00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:03,673
they need to be reintegrated
into their communities.

334
00:16:03,673 --> 00:16:06,644
They need to be able to
have a chance to get a job,

335
00:16:06,644 --> 00:16:10,112
to be able to find decent
housing, and they need to be

336
00:16:10,112 --> 00:16:13,200
able to participate in
the political process.

337
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,240
And that means they need the
right to vote to be reinstated.

338
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,421
They are American citizens.

339
00:16:19,421 --> 00:16:22,421
(audience applauds)

340
00:16:23,523 --> 00:16:26,090
And one more, you talk about safety for

341
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,100
our police officers and you are right.

342
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,001
This is a very serious issue.

343
00:16:30,001 --> 00:16:33,470
One of the main ways that we
could help make our police

344
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:38,377
safer is to get serious about
gun safety in this country.

345
00:16:38,377 --> 00:16:41,377
(audience applauds)

346
00:16:44,746 --> 00:16:46,840
You mentioned Sergeant Gannon's

347
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,122
tragic death in Massachusetts.

348
00:16:49,122 --> 00:16:52,362
I wrote an op-ed with his parents about

349
00:16:52,362 --> 00:16:57,320
asking for our leaders across
this country to step up

350
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,580
and pass some sensible gun safety laws.

351
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,070
We need universal background checks.

352
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:06,941
We need to take weapons of
war off our city streets.

353
00:17:06,941 --> 00:17:09,965
Right now, we live in America where

354
00:17:09,965 --> 00:17:14,965
seven children and teenagers
will die every single day,

355
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:18,394
where the lives of
officers are put at risk.

356
00:17:18,394 --> 00:17:22,820
We need as a country to step
up, to be more responsible,

357
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:26,200
to be willing to push back against the NRA

358
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,860
and to put some sensible
gun safety laws in place.

359
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,810
I think that will be
the best that we can do.

360
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:32,643
Thank you.

361
00:17:32,643 --> 00:17:35,314
Thank you for your question.

362
00:17:35,314 --> 00:17:37,583
(audience applauds and cheers)

363
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,310
- [Anderson] This is Ellie Taylor.

364
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,460
She's from Wisconsin.

365
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,650
She's a student at Harvard
and she's a freshman.

366
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:43,483
Ellie, welcome.

367
00:17:43,483 --> 00:17:44,316
- Hi, Ellie.

368
00:17:44,316 --> 00:17:45,190
- Hi, Senator.

369
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,770
So, this isn't as much of
a policy-based question.

370
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,420
But some have voiced
concerns about you getting

371
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,300
Hillaried in the election,
meaning that you get held

372
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,290
to a higher standard
than your opponent for

373
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:57,721
potentially arbitrary or
may be even sexist reasons.

374
00:17:57,721 --> 00:18:00,082
So what lessons have you learned from 2016

375
00:18:00,082 --> 00:18:02,600
that will help you to
kind of navigate these

376
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,600
situations when you
might be criticized for

377
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,300
something that's partially
motivated by sexist?

378
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,609
- So, that's a really good
question, but if I can,

379
00:18:10,609 --> 00:18:13,787
I want to go back before 2016.

380
00:18:13,787 --> 00:18:15,870
Can we all just let our
hair down here for a minute?

381
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:19,000
This didn't just start in 2016, right?

382
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,200
Been around for a while.

383
00:18:21,156 --> 00:18:24,180
(audience applauds)

384
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,290
I'll tell you when I ran into it big time.

385
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,740
I never thought I was going
to be in elected politics.

386
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,310
I've known what I wanted
to do all my life.

387
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,160
I wanted to be a teacher.

388
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,760
And I thought that
would be my job forever.

389
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,082
And during the crash, I
end up down in Washington

390
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:39,572
setting up a consumer
agency for President Obama.

391
00:18:39,572 --> 00:18:42,240
After I did that for a
year, the Republicans said,

392
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,450
we're never going to let
her stay and run that thing.

393
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,825
So, I came back to Massachusetts.

394
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:49,470
And there was an incumbent Republican,

395
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:52,690
a very popular Republican
incumbent who had the

396
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:55,190
Senate seat and he was
coming up for reelection.

397
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:57,890
Understand, he had high approval ratings,

398
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:01,680
he had a bucket of money in
the bank from Wall Street,

399
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:06,375
and he had just beaten a
woman who was really good

400
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:10,153
and everybody thought was going to win.

401
00:19:10,153 --> 00:19:12,727
So, I start getting these
phone calls from people

402
00:19:12,727 --> 00:19:15,625
and they say, Elizabeth, you should run

403
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:19,540
against him for the Senate seat.

404
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,373
You should do it.

405
00:19:20,373 --> 00:19:21,351
Go ahead.

406
00:19:21,351 --> 00:19:22,184
You should do this thing.

407
00:19:22,184 --> 00:19:25,390
You're going to lose, but
you should definitely do,

408
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,450
these were Democrats calling me.

409
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:28,500
Saying, you should do this.

410
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,333
You're going to lose.

411
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:32,423
All I can say is, Democrats,
get a better message.

412
00:19:33,663 --> 00:19:36,663
(audience applauds)

413
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,954
But people said to me,

414
00:19:40,954 --> 00:19:45,954
you're going to lose because
Massachusetts in 2011,

415
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:48,710
according to conventional wisdom,

416
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:52,652
was not ready to have a
woman senator or governor.

417
00:19:52,652 --> 00:19:55,970
We never had and people said
it's just not going to happen,

418
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,820
not at least for another generation.

419
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,655
Now you can imagine how I heard that.

420
00:19:59,655 --> 00:20:02,319
I heard that as, get in this race,

421
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:05,415
right now, which is what I did.

422
00:20:05,415 --> 00:20:09,087
So I jumped in the race and sure enough,

423
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:13,047
you know, the early coverage
is about what I'm wearing.

424
00:20:13,047 --> 00:20:15,221
It's about my hair.

425
00:20:15,221 --> 00:20:17,060
It's about my voice.

426
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,090
It's about whether or not I smile enough.

427
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,617
I didn't.

428
00:20:20,617 --> 00:20:22,421
It was every part of that.

429
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:27,150
And this kept up and I thought, you know,

430
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:30,164
look, I'm going to be in this race.

431
00:20:30,164 --> 00:20:35,164
I'm going to make something
count every single day.

432
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:39,793
So every day when I saw a little girl,

433
00:20:39,793 --> 00:20:44,520
I would come up and I'd usually
get down, I'm a teacher,

434
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,137
and I would say, hi, my name is Elizabeth

435
00:20:47,137 --> 00:20:52,137
and I'm running for Senate
because that's what girls do.

436
00:20:52,842 --> 00:20:56,842
(audience applauds and cheers)

437
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:07,950
And then we would pinky swear to remember.

438
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:10,484
And so, every night when I went home,

439
00:21:10,484 --> 00:21:14,520
no matter what the day had
been like, I would count up

440
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,861
how many pinky swears we
had done during the day.

441
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:20,520
And I kept getting out there
and hammering my message.

442
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,913
I kept getting out there
talking about what's happening

443
00:21:22,913 --> 00:21:25,440
with working families across the country,

444
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,490
talking about how Washington
works great for the rich

445
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:31,253
and the powerful, just not
working for anyone else,

446
00:21:31,253 --> 00:21:35,000
and how we've got to
fight back against that.

447
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,750
So I talked about it every
single day and ultimately,

448
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,180
I went from 17 points behind that

449
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:45,270
guy to beating him by seven and a half.

450
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:49,324
So, the way I see it is here
we are in a presidential,

451
00:21:49,324 --> 00:21:53,696
and it's the same kind of
you stay after it every day.

452
00:21:53,696 --> 00:21:56,216
One might say you persist.

453
00:21:56,216 --> 00:21:59,216
(audience applauds)

454
00:22:04,786 --> 00:22:07,440
Organize, build a grassroots movement,

455
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,460
fight for working people,

456
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,090
and that's how I'm going
to be the first woman

457
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:13,858
elected president of the United States.

458
00:22:13,858 --> 00:22:15,532
Thank you.

459
00:22:15,532 --> 00:22:16,882
- We're going to take a quick break.

460
00:22:16,882 --> 00:22:19,129
We'll be right back more with
the CNN presidential town hall

461
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:23,276
live in St. Anselm College
in Manchester, New Hampshire.

462
00:22:23,276 --> 00:22:24,730
Stay with us.

463
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:28,647
(audience applauds and cheers)

464
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:35,530
- [Announcer] Leave no man
behind or child or other child.

465
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,833
Or their new friend.

466
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:43,093
Or your giant nephews and their giant dad.

467
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,890
Or a horse.

468
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:51,093
Or a horse's brother for that matter.

469
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:56,457
The room for eight 9000
pound towing Ford Expedition.

470
00:22:58,455 --> 00:23:00,872
(soft music)

471
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,880
- [Announcer] Everyone's

When it comes to reducing the
sugar in your family's diet

00:23:21,477 --> 00:23:23,800
and we're working
together to do just that.

475
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,600
Bringing you more great tasting
beverages with less sugar

476
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,120
or no sugar at all.

477
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,330
Smaller portion sizes.

478
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:35,730
Clear calorie labels and
reminders to think balance.

479
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:38,530
Because we know mom wants what's best.

480
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:42,120
More beverage choices,
smaller portions, less sugar.

485
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,610
Because stuffed animals are clearly

486
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:55,480
no substitute for the real ones.

Feel the clarity and live Claritin clear.

- [Man] Tolkien sir, where you going?

489
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:02,640
- Up the line to find a friend.

490
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,870
- [Man] He must be a very good friend.

491
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:08,459
- [Tolkien] He'd do the same for me.

492
00:24:08,459 --> 00:24:10,400
- We are your brothers Tolkien.

493
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,360
This more than just a friendship,

494
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,643
it's an invincible alliance.

495
00:24:16,614 --> 00:24:18,342
- A fellowship.

496
00:24:18,342 --> 00:24:21,362
(dramatic music)

497
00:24:21,362 --> 00:24:22,753
- Tolkien!

498
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:23,670
- Geoffrey!

499
00:24:25,417 --> 00:24:27,179
- [Announcer] Tolkien, rated PG 13.

500
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:28,320
In theaters everywhere May 10th.

501
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,810
- We bought a house in a neighborhood

502
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:31,410
with a lot of other young couples.

503
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:33,890
Then we noticed something strange.

504
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,210
Oh, could you make me a burger?

505
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:37,123
- [Men] Poof, you're a burger.

506
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,430
- Everyone acts like their parents.

507
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:41,883
- You have a tattoo.
- Yes.

508
00:24:41,883 --> 00:24:43,670
- Fun, do you not work?

509
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,080
- So what kind of mower have you got Seth?

510
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,700
- I don't know, I have
some kid comes over,

511
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,197
we pay him to do it.

512
00:24:49,327 --> 00:24:51,910
- But it's not all bad,
someone even showed us how we

513
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:54,683
can save money by bundling
home and auto with Progressive.

514
00:24:54,683 --> 00:24:56,010
- [Announcer] Progressive
can't protect you from becoming

515
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:58,350
your parents but we can
protect your home and auto.

516
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:01,735
- Your mother murdered,
your daughter shot dead,

517
00:25:01,735 --> 00:25:03,620
now imagine sitting in front of

518
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,580
the person who was responsible.

519
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,900
See what happens when
victims and their offenders

520
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,410

- What's up Kyler it's Dak.

524
00:25:16,157 --> 00:25:19,057
- [Announcer] The 135th
pick, Dak Prescott.

525
00:25:19,057 --> 00:25:22,160
- [Dak] Trust me, I know
what it's like to be doubted.

526
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,510
- [Announcer] He's entirely too small.

527
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:25,220
- [Announcer] He shouldn't
even play quarterback.

528
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:29,350
- [Dal] Remember though, doubt is a gift.

529
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:31,407
It takes you to the next level.

530
00:25:31,407 --> 00:25:32,526
- [Announcer] Kyler Murray is the

531
00:25:32,526 --> 00:25:34,356
best player in college football.

532
00:25:34,356 --> 00:25:35,933
- So what if they doubt you?

533
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,663
They doubted me too.

534
00:25:39,687 --> 00:25:41,113
Go get 'em bro.

535
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,450
- [Matt] SO you take six
people that are about play good

536
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,347
friends and you throw
'em all in the same room

537
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:50,480
and it really worked out great.

538
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,610
- [Jennifer] Why am I getting noticed

539
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:54,250
for my haircut and not for my work?

540
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:55,420
- [David] He stuck me as a romantic.

541
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,480
I just thought this is a guy I can play.

542
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,730
- [Matthew] When it got out of control

543
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,680
I went in and I faced my fear.

544
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,262
- [Lisa] The six of us have a lot more

545
00:26:02,262 --> 00:26:04,690
power than one star of the show.

546
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,420
- I'm Natalie Morales, join me for

547
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,140
Friends Behind Closed Doors,

548
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:12,473
an all new Celebrity Sunday
Special on Reelz Channel 238.

549
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:16,830
- [Announcer] United Shades
Of America with W. Kamau Bell

550
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,380
returns Sunday at 10:00 on CNN.

551
00:26:23,502 --> 00:26:24,335
- And welcome back.

552
00:26:24,335 --> 00:26:25,935
We're live in Manchester, New Hampshire,

553
00:26:25,935 --> 00:26:28,590
for a special CNN Democratic
presidential town hall event.

554
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,500
Five town halls tonight, with some of the

555
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,629
top Democratic contenders, all of them are

556
00:26:32,629 --> 00:26:34,160
taking questions from college students.

557
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,610
Right now, it is Senator
Elizabeth Warren's turn.

558
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:38,890
We're going to have questions
from the audience in a minute.

559
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:42,370
I do just want to ask you, you
have called for impeachment

560
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:44,597
proceedings to be initiated
against President Trump.

561
00:26:44,597 --> 00:26:46,960
What do you say to those
Democrats who say, look,

562
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,120
this is not the time,

563
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,440
it's going to take away the
focus from winning in 2020?

564
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,284
Speaker Pelosi told her caucus
again just today that she

565
00:26:54,284 --> 00:26:57,880
no plans to immediately initiate
impeachment proceedings.

566
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,500
- So, there is no political inconvenience

567
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,113
exception to the United
States Constitution.

568
00:27:05,334 --> 00:27:08,334
(audience applauds)

569
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,030
This one is, if I can, I
want to take a little time

570
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:14,480
on this because I think
this is really important.

571
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:19,811
Last Thursday, I had been out,
I had been to South Carolina.

572
00:27:19,811 --> 00:27:22,510
This was all about climate change.

573
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,000
That's where I was, South Carolina,

574
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,530
coastal communities that were
protesting off shore drilling.

575
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:32,530
I then came to Colorado, the
biggest drought in 1,200 years.

576
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:37,980
And then to Utah where they had one of the

577
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:41,280
worst wildfire seasons in a generation.

578
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,400
I'm on an airplane and
the Mueller report drops.

579
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,270
And so, I start reading
it on the airplane,

580
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,560
I read it on through the evening,

581
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,894
I read it into the wee
hours of the morning.

582
00:27:50,894 --> 00:27:53,143
And when I get to the end,

583
00:27:53,143 --> 00:27:56,070
three things just jump off the page.

584
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,750
I don't care if you're a
Democrat, a Republican,

585
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:01,563
an independent, a
libertarian, a vegetarian.

586
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:05,778
Three things just totally
jump off the page.

587
00:28:05,778 --> 00:28:10,778
The first is that a hostile
foreign government attacked

588
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:15,920
our 2016 election in order
to help Donald Trump.

589
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:17,500
The evidence is just there.

590
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,070
Read it, footnote after footnote,

591
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:21,460
page after page documentation.

592
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:26,460
Part two, Donald Trump welcomed that help.

593
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,780
So, on the first one about what they did,

594
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:33,087
understand, this was a
sophisticated attack.

595
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:36,080
They attacked part of voting system.

596
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,200
That's going to be an ongoing
federal investigation.

597
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,724
They hacked into more than
50 computers at the DNC,

598
00:28:43,724 --> 00:28:48,404
the DCCC, a very serious attack.

599
00:28:48,404 --> 00:28:51,158
And Donald Trump welcoming it,

600
00:28:51,158 --> 00:28:55,062
in the Mueller report, just read it.

601
00:28:55,062 --> 00:28:57,875
He gets off the phone
from an unnamed caller

602
00:28:57,875 --> 00:29:01,280
and looks up and says to the
other person on the phone,

603
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,831
there are more leaks coming.

604
00:29:03,831 --> 00:29:08,223
The idea that he was welcoming
what was happening from the

605
00:29:08,223 --> 00:29:11,535
Russian government, and
by the summer of 2016,

606
00:29:11,535 --> 00:29:15,946
the report documents that by that point,

607
00:29:15,946 --> 00:29:20,946
the Trump campaign
actually had a worked out

608
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:27,400
formal process for dealing
with the leaks that were

609
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,560
coming in from the Russians.

610
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,260
So that's part two.

611
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:35,520
Part three is when the
federal government starts

612
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,184
to investigate part one and part two,

613
00:29:39,184 --> 00:29:44,184
Donald Trump took repeated
steps aggressively to try to

614
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:50,310
halt the investigation,
derail the investigation,

615
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:53,690
push the investigation somewhere else,

616
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:57,370
but otherwise keep that
investigation from going forward

617
00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:00,711
and turning into a serious investigation

618
00:30:00,711 --> 00:30:03,510
about a hostile foreign government that

619
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:08,230
attacked us and about his
own personal interests.

620
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:13,230
So, here's how I see this, if
any other human being in this

621
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:17,373
country had done what's
documented in the Mueller report,

622
00:30:17,373 --> 00:30:20,300
they would be arrested and put in jail.

623
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:24,130
Obstruction of justice is a
serious crime in this country.

624
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:28,140
But Mueller believed because
of the directions from

625
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:32,000
Donald Trump's Justice Department
that he could not bring

626
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,372
a criminal indictment
against a sitting president.

627
00:30:35,372 --> 00:30:38,210
I think he's wrong on that,
but that's what he believed.

628
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:40,920
So he serves the whole thing up to

629
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:44,860
the United States Congress
and says, in effect,

630
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:47,770
if there's going to be any accountability,

631
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:52,480
that accountability has
to come from the Congress.

632
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,160
And the tool that we are given for

633
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:59,171
that accountability is
the impeachment process.

634
00:30:59,171 --> 00:31:02,444
This is not about politics.

635
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:05,150
This is about principle.

636
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:09,410
This is about what kind
of a democracy we have.

637
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:13,050
In a dictatorship, everything
in government revolves

638
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:16,020
around protecting the
one person at the center,

639
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:20,400
but not in our democracy and
not under our Constitution.

640
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:25,400
We have checks and balances,
and we have to proceed here

641
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:29,390
in a way understanding our
place in history that not

642
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:33,760
only protects democracy
now, but protects democracy

643
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,120
when the next president comes in

644
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,680
and the next president and
the president after that.

645
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,453
That's our responsibility.

646
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:44,358
(audience applauds)

647
00:31:45,494 --> 00:31:46,830
- But you started off by saying,

648
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,850
by talking about some of your
travels and people talking

649
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:50,910
about climate change and their
concerns and tabletop issues.

650
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,150
- Yes.

651
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:55,500
- Doesn't putting a lot of
Democrats' focus on impeaching

652
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,800
the president, which is not
going to pass in the Senate,

653
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,110
it's not really going to
go anywhere in that sense,

654
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:02,590
doesn't that take away focus
from the tabletop issues

655
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:05,310
that you and other Democrats
say they want to run on?

656
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:07,930
- So, you know, let me just
say, if you've actually

657
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:10,873
read the Mueller report,
it's all laid out there.

658
00:32:10,873 --> 00:32:12,570
It's not like it's going to take

659
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:14,970
a long time to figure this out.

660
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:15,803
It's there.

661
00:32:15,803 --> 00:32:16,840
It's got the footnotes.

662
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,730
It's got the points.

663
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:21,169
It connects directly to the law.

664
00:32:21,169 --> 00:32:23,382
But this really is fundamentally,

665
00:32:23,382 --> 00:32:26,691
I took an oath to uphold the Constitution

666
00:32:26,691 --> 00:32:28,278
of the United States,

667
00:32:28,278 --> 00:32:32,870
and so did everybody else in
the Senate and in the House.

668
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:37,480
And I believe that every person
in the Senate and the House

669
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:42,480
ought to have to vote
and to say either, yeah,

670
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:47,877
that's okay with me, yeah,
let a president just step in

671
00:32:47,877 --> 00:32:52,140
the way he did when he
told the White House

672
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,650
counsel to go fire Mueller,

673
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:58,340
and then told the White
House counsel to go lie about

674
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:01,200
having told the White House
counsel to go fire Mueller,

675
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,140
and then told the White
House counsel to write

676
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,990
a letter saying that Donald Trump had not

677
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:10,470
told him to go fire
Mueller, and then to say,

678
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:15,260
why on Earth would you take
notes about what I said to you?

679
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:18,843
The lawyers I deal with never
put anything in writing.

680
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:24,560
If there are people in the
House or the Senate who want to

681
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:28,470
say that's what a president
can do when the president is

682
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:32,420
being investigated for his own
wrongdoings or when a foreign

683
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:35,512
government attacks our country,
then they should have to

684
00:33:35,512 --> 00:33:40,028
take that vote and live with
it for the rest of their lives.

685
00:33:40,028 --> 00:33:43,028
(audience applauds)

686
00:33:46,432 --> 00:33:48,963
- I want you to meet,
this is Cecilia D'Arms.

687
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,380
Cecilia is a sophomore at
Harvard from Columbus, Ohio,

688
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,390
studying social studies.

689
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:56,090
She interned for Hillary
Clinton's presidential campaign.

690
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:56,923
Cecilia?

691
00:33:56,923 --> 00:33:57,756
- Hi, Cecelia.

692
00:33:57,756 --> 00:33:58,589
- Hi.

693
00:33:58,589 --> 00:34:00,745
You were registered as
a Republican until 1995.

694
00:34:00,745 --> 00:34:01,662
- I was.

695
00:34:01,662 --> 00:34:03,350
- But you've since become one of

696
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,879
the most progressive people in Congress.

697
00:34:04,879 --> 00:34:06,670
Did you change your beliefs?

698
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:07,950
Or do you believe that the political

699
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:09,540
parties changed around you?

700
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:12,136
- So understand this, Cecilia.

701
00:34:12,136 --> 00:34:15,700
I grew up in a family
that wasn't political.

702
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:19,150
I grew up out in Oklahoma,
and to this day I couldn't

703
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:21,830
tell you how my parents were registered

704
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:25,123
or my grandparents or
much of anybody else.

705
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:27,308
My mom always voted.

706
00:34:27,308 --> 00:34:28,870
I know that.

707
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:31,770
And in fact, she worked
at the polls sometimes,

708
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,990
but we weren't a political family.

709
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:38,670
And when I was a young mom
and struggling to try to keep

710
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:42,620
up with my job and get dinner on the table

711
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:45,340
and take care of a couple of little kids

712
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:50,340
and launch my career, I didn't
think much about politics.

713
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:56,612
Now, I've been a policy
person for a long, long time,

714
00:34:56,612 --> 00:34:59,390
so I think the question
you're asking me is,

715
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:01,250
when does the change come?

716
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:03,090
And that I can tell you.

717
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:08,090
So in late mid-1990s, I had
been working over and over and

718
00:35:08,238 --> 00:35:12,430
over on what's happening to
America's working families,

719
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:16,700
to America's middle class,
how it is that people who work

720
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,950
hard, who play by the
rules are just finding the

721
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:23,690
path steeper and rockier year by year,

722
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:28,250
and for people of color even
steeper and even rockier.

723
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:30,090
This is my life's work.

724
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:32,867
And so I keep working on this about

725
00:35:32,867 --> 00:35:34,890
what's changing in America.

726
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:37,672
I'm studying families that go bankrupt.

727
00:35:37,672 --> 00:35:41,320
And the credit card companies,

728
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:46,270
half-dozen giant credit card
companies figure out that if

729
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:49,920
they can get the bankruptcy
laws changed, that what will

730
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,810
happen is they can improve
their bottom line by just a

731
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:56,718
little by keeping people
locked out of bankruptcy.

732
00:35:56,718 --> 00:35:59,108
Never mind that there's people are

733
00:35:59,108 --> 00:36:01,990
head over heels in medical debts,

734
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:05,339
that they've had job losses
that have put them way behind,

735
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:08,907
that they've had a death
or divorce in the family,

736
00:36:08,907 --> 00:36:12,250
but they've been cheated
by credit card companies

737
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:13,610
and mortgage companies.

738
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:15,250
Never mind any of that.

739
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:18,174
Just improve the bottom line
for the credit card companies.

740
00:36:18,174 --> 00:36:20,300
Man, I looked around in
the middle of that fight

741
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:23,287
and I realized all the
money was on one side

742
00:36:23,287 --> 00:36:25,750
and all the hurting was on the other.

743
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,501
And that's when I jumped in politically.

744
00:36:28,501 --> 00:36:32,790
I got in that fight, and
I fought it for 10 years.

745
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,690
And by the end of that fight,

746
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:39,440
I fully understood that
every single Republican stood

747
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,030
there for the banks and
half of the Democrats did.

748
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:45,928
So my party was the party
that at least we got half of

749
00:36:45,928 --> 00:36:48,700
them to stand up for working people,

750
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,663
and that was the big change for me.

751
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:54,740
(audience applauds)

752
00:36:56,924 --> 00:36:59,740
- This is Eric Jjemba,
a sophomore at Harvard.

753
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:00,760
You can tell from his sweatshirt.

754
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,880
From New Jersey, studying
environmental engineering.

755
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,100
- [Elizabeth] Great sweatshirt, Jjemba.

756
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,640
- [Anderson] He's a former
intern for Senator Cory Booker.

757
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,960
He says he's currently undecided
on who to support in 2020.

758
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,070
Eric?

759
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,211
- Hi, Senator.

760
00:37:11,211 --> 00:37:12,097
- Good to see you, hi.

761
00:37:12,097 --> 00:37:13,490
- Entitlements in this country,
though certainly not the

762
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:15,440
sexiest issue for Democratic candidates

763
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,100
to be discussing in this
race, are an area of concern

764
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,240
that under the status quo
will fail my generation.

765
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,290
Do you have a plan to reform our present

766
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:24,841
Social Security system to
increase its longevity?

767
00:37:24,841 --> 00:37:27,990
- So I'm really glad you
asked about Social Security,

768
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:30,590
because this is one that reminds you

769
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:33,330
how things have broken
apart in this country.

770
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:35,140
As you all know, Social Security passed

771
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,110
back during the Great Depression.

772
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:38,630
The biggest problem with Social Security,

773
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:42,720
it was too narrow and cut
out too many, particularly,

774
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,630
jobs that were largely held by

775
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:47,496
African Americans and other groups.

776
00:37:47,496 --> 00:37:50,700
But Social Security became a mainstay.

777
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:55,359
And from the 1930s until the late 1980s,

778
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:58,640
we understood that Social Security is

779
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,540
not something you can
just set once and go.

780
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,120
Population changes.

781
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,481
How long people live changes.

782
00:38:05,481 --> 00:38:07,840
Women going back to work changes.

783
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,340
How many people get sick change, right?

784
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:14,932
And so every few years,
for a very long time,

785
00:38:14,932 --> 00:38:18,380
we kept making little adjustments.

786
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:22,210
And that way, Social Security
stayed on a track to make sure

787
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:25,560
that it would be there for
your generation and the next

788
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,660
generation and the next
generation after that.

789
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:32,400
In the late 1980s, the
Republicans just said,

790
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,130
no, that we're not going
to make any more changes

791
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:36,610
to Social Security, not
going to increase the

792
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:39,560
revenue stream, not going
to change the pieces.

793
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,280
And we've been locked there.

794
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,854
And the consequence is
every year that goes by,

795
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:48,499
we get the system just a
little further out of whack.

796
00:38:48,499 --> 00:38:52,440
Now, the good news is, we've got roughly,

797
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,550
I haven't checked the latest
numbers, but roughly about

798
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:57,033
20 more years where we
are if we do nothing.

799
00:38:57,033 --> 00:39:00,504
And when it drops, it
would drop by roughly

800
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:04,900
about 25 percent, and then
level out and be there.

801
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,852
So it's not that it will
disappear for your generation.

802
00:39:07,852 --> 00:39:09,523
But here's the deal.

803
00:39:09,523 --> 00:39:13,263
This is one more of those
problems, a little like climate.

804
00:39:13,263 --> 00:39:17,890
The sooner you fix it,
the easier it is to fix.

805
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:20,236
Now it's already hard on this front,

806
00:39:20,236 --> 00:39:23,424
but it's one of those
things we need to fix now.

807
00:39:23,424 --> 00:39:26,400
But the problem we've got is we're caught,

808
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,020
not in that nobody understands the math.

809
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,811
Everybody, well, not everybody
understands the math, but

810
00:39:31,811 --> 00:39:35,420
there are a whole lot of
people who understand the math.

811
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:38,900
The problem is the political
will and the willingness

812
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:43,710
to step up and say, we've
got to make adjustments.

813
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:45,690
We've got to make adjustments on revenue.

814
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:46,980
We have to make adjustments,

815
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:50,332
I believe we need to bend
the curves, they're called,

816
00:39:50,332 --> 00:39:53,860
so that particularly women
who had lower earnings for

817
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:56,890
so many years especially in
the first years that they

818
00:39:56,890 --> 00:40:00,374
were working get better
support in their later years.

819
00:40:00,374 --> 00:40:02,330
But at this moment,

820
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:04,730
there's no political
will to come together.

821
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:07,240
There's no one who's
willing to drive this.

822
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,073
Why?

823
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:11,330
Because Washington keeps
working for those at the top.

824
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:12,890
It's not working for people who

825
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:14,970
are relying on Social Security.

826
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:18,013
So your question was, is this something,

827
00:40:18,013 --> 00:40:19,770
the plan is not hard.

828
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:22,300
It's political will to make it happen.

829
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:25,900
I'm willing to take on that fight.

830
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,010
It's an important fight.

831
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:27,890
So, thank you.

832
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:29,203
Thanks for the question.

833
00:40:30,148 --> 00:40:30,981
(audience applauds)

834
00:40:30,981 --> 00:40:32,660
- [Anderson] Our next
question comes from Max Frank.

835
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,880
He's a senior at Harvard,
studying social studies.

836
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,330
Max took a leave of absence
from college to work as a

837
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:40,510
full-time staffer for Hillary
Clinton's 2016 campaign.

838
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:41,343
Max?

839
00:40:41,343 --> 00:40:42,474
- Hi, Max.

840
00:40:42,474 --> 00:40:43,535
- Good evening, Senator Warren.

841
00:40:43,535 --> 00:40:44,368
You know, as one of your constituents,

842
00:40:44,368 --> 00:40:45,949
I just want to say thank
you for your service.

843
00:40:45,949 --> 00:40:46,866
- Thank you.

844
00:40:46,866 --> 00:40:48,287
- My question has to do with
the politics of this race.

845
00:40:48,287 --> 00:40:51,270
In particular, I know
that you have experienced

846
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:53,759
President Trump's name-calling
and bullying firsthand.

847
00:40:53,759 --> 00:40:57,670
And given the success that
he's had with these tactics

848
00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:00,340
in the past, I was wondering
how you propose to counter

849
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:02,710
them if you were to become
the Democratic nominee.

850
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,760
And then, in particular, are
you worried that he might be

851
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,470
able to caricature you to
general election voters before

852
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:11,581
you've had a chance to
make your candidacy heard?

853
00:41:11,581 --> 00:41:14,120
- So, thanks for the question.

854
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,909
You know, I've been
around this block before.

855
00:41:16,909 --> 00:41:20,293
Back in 2012, when I ran
against that very popular

856
00:41:20,293 --> 00:41:23,672
Republican incumbent,
he ran the same play.

857
00:41:23,672 --> 00:41:28,240
And what I discovered at that
point is that around this

858
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,963
country, around the
commonwealth of Massachusetts,

859
00:41:30,963 --> 00:41:34,491
people care a lot more
about their families than

860
00:41:34,491 --> 00:41:38,831
they do about some kind of name-calling.

861
00:41:38,831 --> 00:41:43,831
I got in the race in '12 and
I got in this race right now

862
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:49,160
as a presidential candidate
not because I looked at myself

863
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:52,303
in the mirror every day
and said, "Oh, Senator.

864
00:41:53,947 --> 00:41:55,127
"President."

865
00:41:56,346 --> 00:41:58,557
It wasn't that at all.

866
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:00,915
It's my life's work.

867
00:42:00,915 --> 00:42:05,466
I grew up in a family that
was paycheck to paycheck.

868
00:42:05,466 --> 00:42:08,870
I was one of those kids who had a dream.

869
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:10,090
We talked about college.

870
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:12,860
I've known what I wanted
to do since second grade.

871
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,792
I wanted to be a public school teacher.

872
00:42:14,792 --> 00:42:17,340
Can we hear it for America's
public school teachers?

873
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,585
Come on, guys.

874
00:42:18,585 --> 00:42:21,585
(audience applauds)

875
00:42:27,482 --> 00:42:30,320
Yeah, I knew what I wanted to do.

876
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:33,151
But there was no money in my family.

877
00:42:33,151 --> 00:42:37,530
And by the time I
graduated from high school,

878
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:41,780
there was no money even
for a college application,

879
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:45,600
much less to send me off
to four years of college.

880
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:49,230
So I have a kind of twisted
story, like some Americans do.

881
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:51,270
We're not all on a straight line on this.

882
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:54,290
And mine is that I won a scholarship.

883
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:55,123
Yay.

884
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:58,730
And then at 19, I fell in love.

885
00:42:58,730 --> 00:42:59,653
Yay.

886
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,770
And then I got married.

887
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:03,853
Yay.

888
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:07,610
And then I dropped out of school, yay.

889
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:10,179
And I took a job answering phones.

890
00:43:10,179 --> 00:43:14,209
And I thought that was
going to be my life forever.

891
00:43:14,209 --> 00:43:18,423
A good life, but not the dream I had.

892
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:21,608
And then I found a commuter college

893
00:43:21,608 --> 00:43:25,659
that cost $50 a semester.

894
00:43:25,659 --> 00:43:28,740
And for a price that I
could pay for on a part-time

895
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:33,720
waitressing job, I had a chance
to get a four-year diploma

896
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,980
and become a special needs teacher.

897
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:38,096
I have lived my dream.

898
00:43:38,096 --> 00:43:43,096
And that's what I believe
is the best of America,

899
00:43:44,215 --> 00:43:47,946
when we open more doors for more people.

900
00:43:47,946 --> 00:43:51,540
I want to live in an America
that's not just about

901
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:54,426
opportunity for those born into privilege,

902
00:43:54,426 --> 00:43:58,242
but that's about
opportunity for all of us.

903
00:43:58,242 --> 00:44:00,820
And that's what we can do.

904
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:03,720
Just those few pieces I put together.

905
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:08,591
A 2 cent wealth tax would let
us do universal childcare,

906
00:44:08,591 --> 00:44:10,630
would let us do universal Pre-K,

907
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:12,830
would let us do universal college,

908
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:16,460
would let us not back the
student loan debt burden,

909
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:18,920
and still have money to spend.

910
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:21,498
I think that this is the case we've

911
00:44:21,498 --> 00:44:24,110
got to make against Donald Trump.

912
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:26,810
We're not going to win by
just saying not Donald Trump.

913
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:28,060
We're not going to win by doing

914
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:30,520
better name-calling than he does.

915
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,870
The way we're going to do
this is we're going to get out

916
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:36,850
and talk about our vision
and how it affects families

917
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:41,470
all across this country, how
it touches people personally.

918
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:45,420
And we're going to invite
people not just to vote but to

919
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:48,660
come off the sidelines
and be part of this,

920
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:53,660
to get engaged, to volunteer,
to kick in five bucks,

921
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:58,430
to go to elizabethwarren.com and sign up.

922
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:00,350
But it's every piece of this,

923
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:05,350
because what's at stake is
not only our economic future,

924
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:08,810
it is also our democracy.

925
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:10,860
And I'm in this fight all the way.

926
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:12,565
I think we make that case.

927
00:45:12,565 --> 00:45:15,020
I think the American people are with us.

928
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:16,963
- We're going to have more
with Senator Elizabeth Warren,

929
00:45:16,963 --> 00:45:19,400
a CNN special Democratic town hall event.

930
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,233
Stay with us.

931
00:45:21,095 --> 00:45:24,320
(dramatic music)

932
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,820
- [Announcer] It's cedar-plank
seafood time at Red Lobster,

933
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:29,580
featuring three new dishes
that are planked to perfection.

934
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:31,800
Feast on new cedar-plank
lobster and shrimp.

935
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,146
Or new colossal shrimp and
salmon with a citrusy drizzle.

936
00:45:34,146 --> 00:45:37,470
Tender, smokey and together on one plank.

937
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:39,243
But not for long, so hurry in.

938
00:45:40,808 --> 00:45:43,225
(soft music)

939
00:45:58,914 --> 00:46:00,357
- I'm okay.

940
00:46:00,357 --> 00:46:02,774

in the world, Norway.

Chasing Life, Saturday
May 4th at 9:00 Eastern.

983
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,262
- I had a lot of root canals, extractions,

984
00:48:12,262 --> 00:48:14,020
always in dental pain.

985
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:16,550
I knew dentures would not be right for me

986
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:17,880
because I'm too active.

987
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:20,430
- I had a lot of cavities, root canals,

988
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:23,070
eating anything cold,
it would hurt so bad.

989
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:24,790
- I was embarrassed of my teeth.

990
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:27,530
I don't think dentures
were ever a solution.

991

premiers Sunday at 9:00 on CNN.

1010
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:18,823
- Welcome back.

1011
00:49:18,823 --> 00:49:20,534
We're live in New Hampshire for a special

1012
00:49:20,534 --> 00:49:22,591
CNN Democratic presidential
town hall even.

1014

Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.

1015
00:49:26,565 --> 00:49:30,544
I want to, our next question
is about climate change.

1016
00:49:30,544 --> 00:49:31,644
- Good.

1017
00:49:31,644 --> 00:49:32,477
- You talked about it briefly.

1018
00:49:32,477 --> 00:49:34,620
It's drastically grown as a
top issue among young voters,

1019
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:36,450
according to a Harvard Institute
of Politics youth poll,

1020
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:37,780
which was released today.

1021
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:38,810
This is Tyler Pearce,

1022
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:40,410
a freshman at the
University of New Hampshire.

1023
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:42,170
He's studying biomedical science,

1024
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:45,600
which I'm not even sure what
that means because I'm dumb.

1025
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:46,910
He worked as a fellow for the

1026
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:50,460
New Hampshire Democratic
Party for the 2018 midterms.

1027
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:51,407
Tyler?

1028
00:49:51,407 --> 00:49:52,304
- Hi, Tyler.

1029
00:49:52,304 --> 00:49:53,207
- Hi, Senator, how are you?

1030
00:49:53,207 --> 00:49:54,040
- I'm good, how about you?

1031
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,024
- Good.

1032
00:49:55,024 --> 00:49:56,080
So my question is, what
will you do to combat

1033
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,650
climate change in a world where the threat

1034
00:49:57,650 --> 00:50:00,080
has become increasingly more dangerous?

1035
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,430
- All right, Tyler,

1036
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:05,954
it is the existential question right now.

1037
00:50:05,954 --> 00:50:09,914
As I said, I was just out in
three different states facing

1038
00:50:09,914 --> 00:50:14,130
climate, the effects of climate
change in different ways,

1039
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:17,093
but all of them potentially devastating.

1040
00:50:17,093 --> 00:50:21,453
I have an 8-year-old grandson,
and I think about what the

1041
00:50:21,453 --> 00:50:24,840
world is going to be like when he's 38.

1042
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:27,860
Will it be a place where our cities

1043
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:30,710
are underwater part of the time?

1044
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:34,510
Will it be a place where
the Midwest has burned up,

1045
00:50:34,510 --> 00:50:37,190
where we have lost some
of our great forests?

1046
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:38,990
Will it be a place where the oceans,

1047
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:41,213
large parts of the oceans are dead?

1048
00:50:41,213 --> 00:50:43,230
Will it be a place where people around

1049
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:45,573
the world are just
fighting for clean water?

1050
00:50:45,573 --> 00:50:49,620
We're running out of time to make change.

1051
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:50,970
We must make change.

1052
00:50:50,970 --> 00:50:53,360
And we must make it now.

1053
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,452
So here's how I see this,

1054
00:50:55,452 --> 00:50:58,764
I am a strong supporter
of the Green New Deal.

1055
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:01,764
(audience applauds)

1056
00:51:04,364 --> 00:51:05,930
And I want to tell you why.

1057
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:08,230
There are two principal reasons for that.

1058
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:09,860
The first reason that I'm a strong

1059
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:12,670
supporter is it is a way to say urgency.

1060
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:15,210
Now, we cannot wait any longer.

1061
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:17,488
We have got to make change.

1062
00:51:17,488 --> 00:51:19,144
That's how I hear this.

1063
00:51:19,144 --> 00:51:22,476
The second part about the
Green New Deal right now is

1064
00:51:22,476 --> 00:51:26,920
it calls for a huge investment
in our infrastructure.

1065
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,860
And I think that's just
absolutely critical.

1066
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:31,380
And when I say our infrastructure,

1067
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:32,860
it's about our green infrastructure,

1068
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:34,644
it's about our power infrastructure,

1069
00:51:34,644 --> 00:51:38,100
but it's also about
hardening our infrastructure

1070
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:41,630
so that we can withstand heavier storms,

1071
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:43,960
so that flooding is not so much a problem,

1072
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:47,042
so that we move to distributed
generation of power.

1073
00:51:47,042 --> 00:51:50,020
Lots of pieces that we need to do.

1074
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:55,020
But I also see this as a time
when it's all hands on deck,

1075
00:51:55,290 --> 00:51:58,120
that is, we need to do everything we can.

1076
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:01,020
So let me just do a
couple that a president of

1077
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:04,576
the United States can do all by herself.

1078
00:52:04,576 --> 00:52:08,658
And that is, part one,
I just put out a plan.

1079
00:52:08,658 --> 00:52:13,576
On the first day of my administration,

1080
00:52:13,576 --> 00:52:15,808
I will put in place a moratorium,

1081
00:52:15,808 --> 00:52:20,808
no new drilling, no new mining
on any federal lands, period.

1082
00:52:20,992 --> 00:52:23,992
(audience applauds)

1083
00:52:27,492 --> 00:52:29,630
We should not be selling out for pennies

1084
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:32,220
on the dollar to mining companies

1085
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:36,290
and to oil companies
our national treasures.

1086
00:52:36,290 --> 00:52:37,420
I'll give you another just little

1087
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:40,900
piece of this, and that is 10,000 jobs.

1088
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:43,830
For people who want to go
spend a year in the national

1089
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:46,670
parks, in the national
forests, to be able to give

1090
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:49,039
something back to the land
and to make some repairs.

1091
00:52:49,039 --> 00:52:52,063
This is a part of what we can do together.

1092
00:52:52,063 --> 00:52:53,949
How about a couple of more pieces?

1093
00:52:53,949 --> 00:52:57,230
The United States is a
world leader on climate.

1094
00:52:57,230 --> 00:53:00,920
We are. We're just leading in
the wrong direction right now.

1095
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,740
And that's dangerous,

1096
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:05,580
because it's not only
what we're doing wrong.

1097
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:07,936
It's that we're giving cover
to the rest of the world

1098
00:53:07,936 --> 00:53:10,600
for everybody who doesn't
want to have to step up,

1099
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,650
who doesn't want to have
to take the tough steps,

1100
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:16,300
who doesn't want to have to
make changes in their economy.

1101
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:17,830
We're giving them cover.

1102
00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:21,210
That stops on the first
day of my administration.

1103
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:23,000
We become a world leader in the

1104
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,380
direction of a sustainable Earth.

1105
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:26,550
That's where we go.

1106
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:28,460
And, by the way, can I
throw in just one more?

1107
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:29,293
I know.

1108
00:53:29,293 --> 00:53:33,621
And that is no coal lobbyists
for head of the EPA.

1109
00:53:33,621 --> 00:53:35,871
(audience applauds)

1110
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:40,053
- All right, we have time for,

1111
00:53:40,053 --> 00:53:42,679
we have time for one more
question from the audience.

1112
00:53:42,679 --> 00:53:44,510
This is Nicholas Fahy.

1113
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:46,100
He's a freshman at Harvard
from Massachusetts.

1114
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:47,480
Nicholas?
- Hi, Nicholas.

1115
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:48,313
- Hi.

1116
00:53:48,313 --> 00:53:51,400
As a Democrat who has a lot
of respect and admiration

1117
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,350
for President Obama but
who also knows that,

1118
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:55,400
like every president,
he had his shortcomings,

1119
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,331
what do you think is the
biggest philosophical difference

1120
00:53:57,331 --> 00:53:58,913
the way you would approach
your job as president

1121
00:53:58,913 --> 00:54:01,620
and the way that President
Obama approached his job?

1122
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:05,734
- You know, I'm going to take this in just

1123
00:54:05,734 --> 00:54:09,045
a little bit different
direction, if I can.

1124
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:11,563
No, no, I'm going to get here.

1125
00:54:13,048 --> 00:54:15,712
So I spent, as I've
told all of you, really,

1126
00:54:15,712 --> 00:54:18,470
my whole life's work about what's

1127
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:19,797
happening to working families.

1128
00:54:19,797 --> 00:54:24,797
And starting in the early
2000s, the crisis was coming.

1129
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,520
I was waving my arms, ringing the bell,

1130
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,320
doing everything I could.

1131
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:33,424
I said families are getting
cheated all over this country.

1132
00:54:33,424 --> 00:54:35,780
It started when the mortgage companies

1133
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:37,634
targeted communities of color.

1134
00:54:37,634 --> 00:54:39,430
They targeted seniors.

1135
00:54:39,430 --> 00:54:41,210
They targeted Latinos.

1136
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:45,592
They came in and sold the
worst possible mortgages

1137
00:54:45,592 --> 00:54:48,940
and stripped wealth out
of those communities,

1138
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:52,290
and then took those
products across the nation.

1139
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:53,650
I went everywhere I could.

1140
00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:56,013
I talked about it to
anyone who would listen,

1141
00:54:56,013 --> 00:54:57,910
a crisis is coming.

1142
00:54:57,910 --> 00:55:00,520
And I'll just say,
nobody wanted to hear it.

1143
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:02,710
Really basically what
happened in Washington,

1144
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:03,750
nobody could hear it.

1145
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:06,490
I learned, if your ears
are stuffed with money,

1146
00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:07,590
it's hard to hear.

1147
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:12,590
So the crisis hit in 2007,
2008, and just took us down.

1148
00:55:14,844 --> 00:55:16,890
The big question becomes,

1149
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:18,855
so what are you going to do going forward?

1150
00:55:18,855 --> 00:55:23,190
And a lot of folks thought
what we should do is we should

1151
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:25,830
just take care of the big
financial institutions.

1152
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:29,410
My view was, we've got to
put a cop on the beat to make

1153
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:33,350
sure that this never happens
to working families again.

1154
00:55:33,350 --> 00:55:36,674
So the idea I had, Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau,

1155
00:55:36,674 --> 00:55:38,530
I said, I'm going to get in this fight.

1156
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:39,820
I was a college professor.

1157
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:42,360
I have no political sway,
but I'm going to get in

1158
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:43,920
this fight and I'm going to fight for it.

1159
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,180
And here was the deal.

1160
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:46,900
People told me two things.

1161
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,141
Great idea.

1162
00:55:48,141 --> 00:55:50,620
Don't even try.

1163
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:54,330
And the reason not to try is
there is no way on God's green

1164
00:55:54,330 --> 00:55:57,930
Earth you will ever get this
passed, because the giant

1165
00:55:57,930 --> 00:56:02,930
financial institutions will
fight you every inch of the way.

1166
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:04,223
- [Anderson] We've got to wrap it up.

1167
00:56:04,223 --> 00:56:05,470
- All right.

1168
00:56:05,470 --> 00:56:06,420
So here's what happened.

1169
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:07,800
I got in the fight.

1170
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,200
President Obama signed it into law.

1171
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:15,084
And he was the one who stood
there when everyone else said

1172
00:56:15,084 --> 00:56:19,700
in his administration, throw
that agency under the bus.

1173
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:23,000
And he said, no, I'm not
going to let this crisis pass

1174
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,460
and not come away with a
consumer agency that makes sure

1175
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:29,320
that families never get cheated again.

1176
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:32,580
I will always be grateful
to the president for that.

1177
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:34,380
- [Anderson] Senator Elizabeth Warren.

1178
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:36,070
Up next, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.

1179
00:56:36,070 --> 00:56:37,821
We'll be right back.

1180
00:56:37,821 --> 00:56:41,738
(audience applauds and cheers)

1181
00:56:43,109 --> 00:56:45,526
(soft music)

1182
00:56:58,010 --> 00:57:00,570
- [Announcer] Everyone's
gotta listen to mom.

1183
00:57:00,570 --> 00:57:03,309
When it comes to reducing the
sugar in your family's diet

1184
00:57:03,309 --> 00:57:06,087
Coke, Dr Pepper and Pepsi hear you

1185
00:57:06,087 --> 00:57:08,480
and we're working
together to do just that.

1186
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,980
Bringing you more great tasting

1187
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:12,790
beverages with less
sugar or no sugar at all.

1188
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:16,020
Smaller portion sizes.

1189
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:17,840
Clear calorie labels

1190
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:19,812
and reminders to think balance.

1191
00:57:19,812 --> 00:57:22,730
Because we know mom wants what's best.

1192
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:26,350
More beverage choices,
smaller portions, less sugar,

balanceus.org.

1194
00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:29,510
- I like to make my life easy.

1195
00:57:31,610 --> 00:57:32,443
Romo Mode.

1196
00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:34,510
Good luck with that one.

1197
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:36,870
Yes!

1198
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,520
That's why I wear Sketchers slip ons.

1199
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:40,610
They're effortless, just
slim them right on and off.

1200
00:57:40,610 --> 00:57:42,930
Sketchers slip ons, with
Air Cooled memory foam.

1201
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:45,050
- [Announcer] Allergies with
sinus congestion and pressure?

1202
00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:46,330
You won't find relief here.

1203
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:48,760
Go to the pharmacy counter
for powerful Claritin-D.

1204
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:51,250
While the leading allergy spray
only relieves six symptoms

1205
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:52,800
Claritin-D relievers eight,

1206
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,876
including sinus congestion and pressure.

1207
00:57:54,876 --> 00:57:56,873
Claritin-D relieves more.

1208
00:57:58,456 --> 00:58:01,014
- Uh oh, looks like someone's still

1209
00:58:01,014 --> 00:58:02,906
nervous about buying a new house.

1210
00:58:02,906 --> 00:58:04,668
- Is it that obvious?

1211
00:58:04,668 --> 00:58:06,165
- Yes it is.

1212
00:58:06,165 --> 00:58:08,470
You know maybe you'd worry
less if you got Geico

1213
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:10,540
to help with your homeowners insurance.

1214
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:13,010
- I didn't know Geico helps
with homeowners insurance.

1215
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:15,010
- Yeah, they've been doing it for years.

1216
00:58:16,446 --> 00:58:18,650
What are you doing?

1217
00:58:18,650 --> 00:58:19,503
Big Steve?

1218
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:24,140
- Thanks man.
- There he is.

1219
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:25,360
- [Announcer] Get to know
Geico and see how much you

1220
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:28,620
could save on homeowners
and renters insurance.

1221
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:30,570
- Your patio is so cozy.

1222
00:58:30,570 --> 00:58:34,110
- Oh well, our yard could
really use some work.

1223
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:35,880
Do you know any good landscapers?

1224
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,330
- Oh you know, I think I do.

1225
00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:39,230
- Oh I'd love to take your advice

1226
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:41,910
but I need quotes from your top four guys

1227
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:44,810
and check their credentials
and customer reviews.

1228
00:58:44,810 --> 00:58:48,150
Oh and I would like to get
them started this week.

1234
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:04,255
Some people might try to
tell you that it's a banana.

1235
00:59:04,255 --> 00:59:07,160
They might scream
"Banana, banana, banana,"

1236
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:09,496
over and over and over again.

1237
00:59:09,496 --> 00:59:12,554
They put banana in all caps.

1238
00:59:12,554 --> 00:59:16,183
You might even start to
believe that this is a banana.

1239
00:59:17,882 --> 00:59:18,793
But it's not.

1240
00:59:20,527 --> 00:59:22,703
This is an apple.

to severe ulcerative colitis

1242
00:59:30,330 --> 00:59:33,544
or Crohn's symptoms are holding you back

1243
00:59:33,544 --> 00:59:36,727
and your current treatment
hasn't worked well enough

1244
00:59:36,727 --> 00:59:40,043
it may be time for a change.

1245
00:59:41,301 --> 00:59:46,180
As your doctor about Entyvio,
the only biologic developed

1246
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:48,970
and approved just for UC and Crohn's.

1247

Entyvio works at the site of
inflammation in the GI tract

1248
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:54,040
and is clinically proven
to help many patients

1249
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:56,550
achieve both symptom relief and remission.

1250
00:59:56,550 --> 00:59:59,140
Infusion and serious
allergic reactions can happen

1251
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:01,320
