1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,300
(upbeat music)
- More, you save more.

2
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:05,700
Up to $1,000 on furniture
that's already marked down.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,190
With more styles and custom
fabrics to choose from.

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,243
Celebrate your independence
with furniture that fits you.

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,813
Havertys, life looks good.

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,640
- Right now at 11, numerous showers

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,910
and thunderstorms expected
on the 4th of July.

8
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,410
I'll have your hour-by-hour
forecast coming up.

9
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:25,980
(dramatic music)

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,080
- It is going to be a very
festive fourth here in D.C.

11
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,480
but I will tell you why some say

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,963
it is costing taxpayers too much money.

13
00:00:34,151 --> 00:00:36,450
- [Narrator] And, if you
need even more of a reason

14
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,050
to stay sober behind
the wheel this holiday,

15
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,470
you have to see what a
suspected drunk driver

16
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,670
did to a police officer.

17
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,204
Your news starts now.

18
00:00:46,204 --> 00:00:48,954
(dramatic music)

19
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,360
- [Sarah] We begin
tonight with a live look

20
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,040
at the National Mall.

21
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,990
Tomorrow, people will fill the Mall

22
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,550
to celebrate the 4th of July.

23
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,360
- [Shawn] It is all clear
tonight, but we are watching

24
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,220
for popup storms that could put a damper

25
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,630
on your holiday plans tomorrow.

26
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,180
- All right, let's get
right over to Caitlin now.

27
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,770
She is tracking when and where

28
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:10,280
the showers and storms could hit.

29
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,570
And you know, we're kinda used to this

30
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:13,940
on the 4th of July, aren't we?
- I know.

31
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,010
Yeah, we do this every year it feels like.

32
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,060
I mean, what's a holiday

33
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,575
without a weather challenge around here?

34
00:01:18,575 --> 00:01:19,820
Especially in the summer.

35
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:20,770
We're gonna do that tomorrow.

36
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,470
Probably several rounds of
popup showers and storms.

37
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:24,720
Depending on where you are,

38
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,480
you might not see much.

39
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,390
In other spots, might see a lot.

40
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,480
So we're just gonna call
it a stormy day tomorrow,

41
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,863
because the potential is there

42
00:01:31,863 --> 00:01:34,540
for lots of showers and
thunderstorms to fire up.

43
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,080
Some of which may be severe,

44
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,960
some of which may bring some heavy rains.

45
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,160
So that's a lot to keep track of

46
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,910
as you're trying to get
from your pool parties

47
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,230
to your barbecues, to
your firework festivities.

48
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,860
Storm Tracker Radar quiet tonight.

49
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,650
We got the day off, that felt great.

50
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,650
Showers and thunderstorms
last night were relentless.

51
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:52,740
So it was wonderful to not
see much around the Metro.

52
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,098
We're gonna stay quiet overnight tonight.

53
00:01:54,098 --> 00:01:55,550
Just a few clouds,

54
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,460
muggy and mild, with that low of 76.

55
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,750
Looking ahead to tomorrow.

56
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:00,760
The heatwave rolls on.

57
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,670
It began on Tuesday, we're gonna continue

58
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,197
to see temperatures into the 90s.

59
00:02:04,197 --> 00:02:06,610
And that heat index in the upper 90s.

60
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,600
But as early as the lunch hour,

61
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,090
showers and thunderstorms
are expected to fire up.

62
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,910
And we could be in for one of those days

63
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:13,810
where you're just dodging them.

64
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,070
So you might wanna have a backup plan

65
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,500
if you're gonna be outdoors, you know,

66
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,290
run inside as skies start to darken.

67
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,100
And there could a few postponements

68
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,730
out there tomorrow afternoon.

69
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,024
Here's your planning forecast warning.

70
00:02:23,024 --> 00:02:25,810
No problem, temperatures
start out very mild,

71
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,000
around 80 degrees.

72
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,430
Near 90 by the lunch hour,
and then we'll be watching

73
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,350
for those showers and thunderstorms
in the fireworks time.

74
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:35,990
I think most of the heavy-hitting
action will be over with,

75
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,730
you know, the severe
weather, by nine o'clock.

76
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:39,510
But there could be some lingering rain.

77
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,210
We'll talk more about that
and I'll show you future casts

78
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,270
coming up in your full seven-day forecast.

79
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,463
Sarah and Shawn?

80
00:02:44,463 --> 00:02:45,296
(upbeat band music)
- All right, now that

81
00:02:45,296 --> 00:02:46,129
you know the forecast,

82
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:48,180
let's get ya caught up on
everything else you need to know

83
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,170
about some of the big events
in the District tomorrow.

84
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,320
Events in D.C. start just before noon

85
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,180
with the National Independence Day Parade

86
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,330
on Constitution Avenue Northwest.

87
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,730
Gates open at 3:30 p.m.

88
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,820
for President Trump's Salute to America.

89
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,800
That's at the Lincoln
Memorial which starts at 6:30.

90
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,190
And the annual Capitol
Fourth gets underway

91
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,900
on the West Lawn of the U.S. Capitol

92
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,520
at eight tomorrow night.

93
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,130
The big fireworks display
expected to begin after nine p.m.

94
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,340
Now, in addition to the
massive fireworks display

95
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,730
and the concert, new this year,

96
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,730
President Trump's Salute to America,

97
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,850
which include tanks, a military flyover,

98
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,556
and a hefty price tag that
some say is outrageous,

99
00:03:23,556 --> 00:03:25,680
but others say is money well spent.

100
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,220
FOX 5's Josh Rosenthal is live

101
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,210
near the Lincoln Memorial
tonight with the latest.

102
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,043
Hey, Josh.

103
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,900
- Hey, Shawn, you know we
are less than 24 hours away

104
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,350
and as you can see, this
year's 4th of July's gonna be

105
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,790
a little different than years past.

106
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,520
It'll be more expensive, too;
however a whole lot of people

107
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,650
that I talked to out here
today said they think

108
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,750
it's money well spent.

109
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,150
- I think we spend a lot
of money on a lot of things

110
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,620
that we don't really
know where it's going,

111
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:54,290
so this is a great for, in my
mind, a great use of funds.

112
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,850
- If Congress doesn't get
their act together anyway

113
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:58,810
and wants to waste it on
their own pet projects,

114
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,760
why not have something to celebrate us?

115
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,530
- [Josh] But everyone
isn't quite so pleased.

116
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,130
Here's the deal: The
Washington Post reported

117
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,820
that the National Park
Service is diverting

118
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,135
about two and a half million
bucks in park entrance fees

119
00:04:10,135 --> 00:04:12,130
to cover additional costs associated with

120
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:12,963
the President's event.

121
00:04:12,963 --> 00:04:14,500
That money could have
been spent on improving

122
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,810
parks across the country
and even fixing potholes

123
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,970
on certain roads like the G.W. Parkway.

124
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,160
And remember, there's about
a 12 billion dollar backlog

125
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,050
of maintenance needs that the Park Service

126
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,650
is already struggling to handle.

127
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,880
- They claim that they
want to help protect

128
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,100
our national parks and
they want to provide

129
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,850
the money necessary and
to address the backlog

130
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,000
of the Park Service.

131
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,560
And then they turn around and they used

132
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,560
these very valuable
dollars from park visitors

133
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,223
to pay for this spectacle.

134
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,780
- Now, I did reach out to
the National Park Service

135
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,059
with a whole lot of questions about this,

136
00:04:50,059 --> 00:04:51,470
but they didn't answer any of 'em.

137
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,357
Instead, they sent a
statement simply saying,

138
00:04:53,357 --> 00:04:55,097
"The Department of the
Interior is committed to

139
00:04:55,097 --> 00:04:57,027
"providing the American people a fantastic

140
00:04:57,027 --> 00:04:58,737
"celebration of our nation's birthday.

141
00:04:58,737 --> 00:05:00,597
"We are doing so consistent
with the Department's

142
00:05:00,597 --> 00:05:02,870
"mission and historical practices."

143
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,660
I do wanna mention, we still don't have

144
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,700
a final total price tag
for this event tomorrow,

145
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,940
however, some of the stuff
that you're gonna see,

146
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,060
for instance, the extra
fireworks, have been donated.

147
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:13,960
Guys, back to you.

148
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,150
- And the President's
Salute to America tomorrow

149
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,670
is also expected to attract protestors.

150
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,780
Members of CODEPINK plan to demonstrate.

151
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,740
The group's organizers
said the event is turning

152
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,960
into a military style show of force

153
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,660
and does not represent the true meaning

154
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,920
of Independence Day.

155
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,910
They wanted to fly the Baby Trump balloon

156
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:33,440
we've seen flying in London
and other parts of Europe

157
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,520
as protest, but the National Park Service

158
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,540
denied their request.

159
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,887
CODEPINK says, "Even if
the balloon cannot fly,

160
00:05:38,887 --> 00:05:40,657
"the group will take a stand."

161
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,840
- We do think it's important to oppose

162
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,240
what the President is doing.

163
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,340
I'm a D.C. resident, and
we know that the last time

164
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,640
President Trump wanted to
have a military parade,

165
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,840
the D.C. residents spoke out so forcefully

166
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,730
and our representatives
in the City Council

167
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,057
said, "No way."

168
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,830
- [Shawn] CODEPINK, again, wanted to fly

169
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:07,670
that Baby Trump balloon about
two feet off the ground,

170
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:10,650
but the Park Service grounded that idea.

171
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:11,990
- [Sarah] All right, here is a live look

172
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,960
at Reagan National Airport,

173
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,540
where this year's 4th of July
plans on the National Mall

174
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,060
will force the airport to
close down temporarily.

175
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,720
Flights will be suspended
from 6:15 to 7:45 p.m.,

176
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,750
for the military flyovers that are part of

177
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,820
the President's event.

178
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,560
And again from 9:00 to 9:45
p.m., for the fireworks.

179
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,000
Of course, you're encouraged to check with

180
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,510
your airline, see whether
or not your flight

181
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,920
may be affected by this.

182
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,927
TSA says, "Between today and Sunday,

183
00:06:35,927 --> 00:06:39,330
"about 12 million people
will fly for the holiday."

184
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,030
- [Shawn] Virginia's
Department of Transportation

185
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,630
is sending drivers a serious
message on this holiday.

186
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,660
In a fun way, though.

187
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,360
This sign was spotted on I-95 today.

188
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,147
It reads, "You're not a firework.

189
00:06:49,147 --> 00:06:50,670
"Don't drive lit."

190
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,100
In a nutshell, they're warning you not to

191
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,079
get behind the wheel if
you're under the influence.

192
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:56,430
- Rehearsals are wrapping up for

193
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,710
the 39th Annual A Capitol
Fourth celebration

194
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,290
hosted by John Stamos.

195
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,590
People will also get the
chance to see performances

196
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,930
by Sesame Street, Vanessa
Williams, the O'Jays,

197
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,330
and many others tomorrow.

198
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,560
The show starts at 8:00
p.m. on the West Lawn

199
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,760
of the Capitol Building.

200
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,190
- [Shawn] A little
pre-Independence Day celebration

201
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,730
this evening at FedExField.

202
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,340
SKYFOX gave us a bird's eye view

203
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,148
of tonight's Rolling Stones concert.

204
00:07:18,148 --> 00:07:20,880
Mick Jagger, Keith Richards,
and the rest of the band

205
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,210
played in front of a packed house

206
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,630
for their No Filter Tour.

207
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:27,730
The legendary band delayed
the tour earlier this year

208
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:30,600
while Mick Jagger recovered
from heart surgery.

209
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,433
All right, well, there was

210
00:07:31,433 --> 00:07:32,650
also an early fireworks show

211
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,720
just up the road at Six Flags in Largo.

212
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,780
It was part of the theme
park's July 4th Fest.

213
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,260
If you missed tonight's show, don't worry,

214
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,400
you'll have a chance to see it

215
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,100
several more times this week.

216
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,660
In fact, the next three
nights at Six Flags,

217
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,640
tonight's, or I should say
tomorrow night's display,

218
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,710
begins at 9:15.

219
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:48,543
There will also be

220
00:07:48,543 --> 00:07:50,440
holiday celebrations all
over the region tomorrow,

221
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,690
and FOX 5 has you covered
from the easiest ways

222
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:55,590
to get around to where you
can find the local events

223
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:56,423
in your neighborhood.

224
00:07:56,423 --> 00:07:58,574
It is all on the FOX 5 app.

225
00:07:58,574 --> 00:08:00,200
(upbeat music)

226
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,410
- All right, a Maryland mother

227
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,350
is warning other parents after she said

228
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,760
her son contracted a flesh-eating bacteria

229
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,070
in Ocean City, Maryland.

230
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,020
- The images of her son's legs and arms

231
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:09,867
are difficult to look at.

232
00:08:09,867 --> 00:08:12,050
FOX 5's Lindsay Watts is
here now with the story.

233
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,040
Lindsay, I understand
this isn't the only case

234
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,280
on the eastern seaboard.

235
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,090
- Shawn and Sarah, there have
been several of these lately.

236
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:20,700
In the case of a Florida
woman, it was deadly.

237
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,866
Now, fortunately, the boy
in Ocean City is recovering

238
00:08:23,866 --> 00:08:26,920
despite these painful looking injuries.

239
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,630
This bacteria is rare,
but something to certainly

240
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,150
be aware of when you're swimming.

241
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,433
We wanna warn you, some
of the graphics here

242
00:08:32,433 --> 00:08:34,243
are hard to watch.

243
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:38,540
These images have been
shared thousands of times

244
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:41,760
on social media, along
with a mother's message.

245
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,290
She says her son was in West Ocean City

246
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,520
swimming in the bay near Route 50.

247
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,920
She says a day later, she
noticed little spots on his body.

248
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,940
The next day, they were open wounds,

249
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:56,230
and then doctors informed her,
her son contracted Vibrio,

250
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,100
a flesh-eating bacteria.

251
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,260
Her latest update is good news.

252
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,060
Her son is healing.

253
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,140
But what happened comes just days

254
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,940
after a Florida woman died near Tampa.

255
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,690
Lynn Fleming's injuries are devastating.

256
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,470
And family says it all
started when the 77 year old

257
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,000
scraped her leg in the water.

258
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,900
- Told my mom multiple times,
I just wanna be normal again.

259
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,740
- [Lindsay] Elsewhere
in Florida, 12 year old

260
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,070
Kylei Parker had to have a
chunk of her leg removed.

261
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,810
It was after she went in the ocean

262
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,940
with a skateboard injury on her foot.

263
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,716
- [Michelle] Scuff on her toe, and--

264
00:09:27,716 --> 00:09:29,010
- [Kylei] Which was almost healed.

265
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,593
- I mean, it almost cost her her life.

266
00:09:30,593 --> 00:09:33,980
It's just so hard seeing
friends and family

267
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,960
and, you know, on the beach having fun,

268
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,870
'cause we were there doing the same thing.

269
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,527
- [Lindsay] The Centers
for Disease Control says

270
00:09:39,527 --> 00:09:42,157
"The bacteria typically
enters the body through

271
00:09:42,157 --> 00:09:44,980
"cuts, burns, or insect bites."

272
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,307
It is rare and the CDC
says, "Most who contract it

273
00:09:48,307 --> 00:09:50,280
"have other health problems."

274
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,250
Early symptoms include
wet or swollen skin,

275
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,660
pain and fever.

276
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,490
Doctors say, "It's crucial to
get treatment immediately."

277
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,350
- A very small wound, and
the thing that terrifies you

278
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,070
as a doctor, is right in front of you,

279
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,520
you're seeing this get worse.

280
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,900
- Necrotizing fasciitis
is the medical term

281
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,100
for this condition.

282
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,857
The CDC says, "As many
as one in three people

283
00:10:10,857 --> 00:10:13,690
"with the infection do
end up dying from it."

284
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:14,523
Sarah.

285
00:10:15,704 --> 00:10:18,440
(people cheering)
(bell clanging)

286
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,640
- [Sarah] In case you missed
it, there were fireworks

287
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,960
on Wall Street ahead
of the 4th, literally.

288
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,010
The Dow, the NASDAQ, and
the S&P 500 all closing

289
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,080
at record highs.

290
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,910
The trading day ended with sparklers.

291
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:29,743
You see right there,

292
00:10:29,743 --> 00:10:33,800
celebrating Macy's 4th of
July Fireworks Spectacular.

293
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,870
Markets will be closed
tomorrow for the holiday.

294
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,290
- All right, well, if
you had a little trouble

295
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:39,736
posting to social media today,
(upbeat music)

296
00:10:39,736 --> 00:10:40,900
you weren't alone.

297
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,650
We're gonna tell you what
caused the world wide problems.

298
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:46,120
- Plus, caught on camera, a
man is accused of throwing

299
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,566
a lit firecracker at
a local police officer

300
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:50,013
sitting in a cruiser.

301
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,350
- [Shawn] And the blue crab
population is on the rise

302
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,290
in the Chesapeake Bay.

303
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:57,453
What it means for your
plate and also your wallet.

304
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,240
- [Sarah] And coming up on The Final 5,

305
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,720
the issue of adding a citizenship question

306
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,150
to the 2020 census seemed
like it was settled,

307
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,090
but then, the President tweeted

308
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,900
and now even members of his administration

309
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,720
are confused about what's going on.

310
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,219
Catch The Final 5 tonight at 11:30.

Another legal setback for
President Trump's effort

to build his border wall.

374
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,970
Today, a Federal Appeals Court ruled

375
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:53,870
the Federal Government cannot tap into

build sections of the wall

The Appeals Court ruling
upheld a lower court decision.

379
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,310
It is unclear, though, if
the Trump Administration

inside a marked cruiser
Saturday in Forestville.

385
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,730
Investigators determined
the incident was preplanned

386
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,280
because someone recorded
it on their phone.

401
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,300
He attributed his illness to months

402
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,610
of digging through rubble at Ground Zero

403
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:58,270

11 terrorist attacks.

404
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:01,640
Today he was remembered as
a brave and faithful man.

405
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,780
- At the end of the
day, and all throughout

his remarkable life, Lu just
wanted to do what's right.

407
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:09,320
And he desperately wanted others,

positions of great power,

409

00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,690
got very emotional when they
testified before Congress,

412
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,780
hoping to convince
lawmakers to pass a bill

413
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,930
that would continue funding

414

of the year in the state.

00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:32,350
The victim was an elderly
woman in Anne Arundel County.

419
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,010
The Department, of course, has some tips

420
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:34,843
to stay cool out there.

421
00:15:34,843 --> 00:15:35,827
"Drink lots of fluids.

422
00:15:35,827 --> 00:15:37,957
"Wear loose-fitting and
light-colored clothing.

423

"Also, avoid the direct sunlight,

424
00:15:39,307 --> 00:15:41,580
"and take it easy with
the outdoor activity.

425
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,778
Just a reminder for you.

426
00:15:42,778 --> 00:15:43,730
- [Shawn] All right, got
a little good news now

427
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:44,700
for crab lovers.

428
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,360
A new report revealed the Chesapeake Bay

429
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,270
blue crab population is
up 60% from last year.

430
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:52,490
That's the highest since 2012.

431
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,330
But the people who run
the Bethesda Crab House

432
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,587
told us, "The growing crab population

433
00:15:56,587 --> 00:15:59,167
"won't likely translate to lower prices

434
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:01,050
"for you crab lovers."

435
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:04,180
- Population increase isn't that much

436
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,707
of a population increase when it comes to

437
00:16:05,707 --> 00:16:08,540
price becoming less, you know.

438
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,700
There are more of 'em,
but not more of a lot.

439
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,270
More of a little.

440
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,977
- [Shawn] Experts say,
"It takes several years

441
00:16:13,977 --> 00:16:16,167
"of population increases before there is

442
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:18,378
"a change in price."

443
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:20,340
(bright Caribbean music)
- Now from the Bay to a story

444
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,990
from under the sea.

445
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,583
There's a new little mermaid in town.

446
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:26,960
Halle Bailey, half of the
sister duo Chloe and Halle,

447
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,110
will be starring as Ariel
in Disney's live-action

448
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,730
remake of The Little Mermaid.

449
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,560
The film's director released
a statement saying that

450
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,490
Halle possesses a rare
combination of spirit, heart,

451
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,680
youth, innocence, and substance.

452
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,490
Production for the
live-action Little Mermaid

453
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,300
begins in 2020.

454
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,133
- [Shawn] That's awesome.

455
00:16:43,133 --> 00:16:45,130
- [Sarah] Yeah, all right, all right.

456
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,433

457
00:16:46,433 --> 00:16:47,950

- No, no, Bailey.

458
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:48,910
- Bailey.
- She's a singer.

459
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:49,743
- A little different.

460
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:51,230
What a beautiful Wednesday.

461

463
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,670

photojournalist, Van Applegate,

464
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:59,410
shot this, but there's a
chance we will not have

465
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:01,300
this picturesque scene
tomorrow, right, Caitlin?

466
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,910
- [Caitlin] Yeah, I'm
hoping we could least clear

467
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,440
things out by fireworks time.

468
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,490
It's gonna be a, kind of a busy afternoon

469
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:07,650
with showers and thunderstorms,

470
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,420
so you're dodging around that.

471
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,210
Peak time probably about
10 to, or 12 to six.

472
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:14,790
- So a little bit earlier
means let's try to get this

473
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,042

- All right, yes.

474
00:17:16,042 --> 00:17:17,860
- [Caitlin] At least in my mind. (laughs)

475
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,520
There's some red, white, and blue for ya.

476
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,530
- [Sarah] All right, look at that.

477
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:21,688
The Capitol Wheel all lit up tonight.

478
00:17:21,688 --> 00:17:22,710
- [Shawn] Beautiful!

479
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,801
- That wheel puts on a
show night after night

480
00:17:24,801 --> 00:17:27,380
and we love to display it for ya.

481
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,580
Beautiful evening out there.

482
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,110
It's warm, but it's clear.

483
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,960
Storms stayed away from the Metro today.

484
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,104
In fact, we barely even got anything

485
00:17:33,104 --> 00:17:34,670
anywhere close by.

486
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,880
It was nice to have a night off from that

487
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,990
despite the fact that it was
another hot and humid day.

488
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,670
So, it's all red, white, and
blue as you go into tomorrow.

489
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:42,810
Can't let the weather stop you.

490
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:44,050
Just gotta be inside.

491
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:46,140
Maybe if, you know,
you're out by the pool,

492
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,900
out doing some barbecuing and those skies

493
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,440
start to darken and the rain comes down.

494
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,570
So, today, like we said, was gorgeous.

495
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:55,870
Fourth of July eve, so hopefully everyone

496
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:58,130
is in full festivity mode.

497
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:00,550
Beautiful sunset captured
by our friend Will

498
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,730
here on Twitter.

499
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:04,020
This is in Olney, you
see the last of that sun

500
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,290
slipping below the horizon.

501
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:07,410
A lot of beautiful
yellow and orange color.

502
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,320
That looks like a hot summer sunset to me.

503
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,610
And, in fact, it was a hot summer day.

504
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:15,980
93 was the magic number for
Reagan, Dulles, and BWI.

505
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,290
It was hot out there.

506
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:18,750
It was above normal.

507
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,800
It was also humid.

508
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,590
And those heat index values
were getting close to,

509
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,990
and in some places surpassing,

510
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:26,650
the century mark earlier this afternoon.

511
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:28,470
83 degrees in the District right now.

512
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:29,980
Winds are still out of the northwest.

513
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,318
That's what saved us today.

514
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:33,930
That wind from the north
prevented any storms

515
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,905
from really initiating,
and so we were quiet

516
00:18:35,905 --> 00:18:38,120
and we'll be quiet again
into the overnight.

517
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,704
83 outside right now here
in the District, still warm.

518
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:41,883
84 in Annapolis.

519
00:18:41,883 --> 00:18:44,790
We've fallen back into the
upper 70s north and west.

520
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,010
77 in Frederick, 78 in Dulles.

521
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:49,990
So, national radar shows that there were

522
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,840
some showers and storms
over the past three hours

523
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,673
across the mountains.

524
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,135
Just really didn't get anything local.

525
00:18:54,135 --> 00:18:55,720
Tomorrow's a different story.

526
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,990
We actually have a bit of
a system coming through.

527
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:00,130
So that will really tap
into the heat and humidity

528
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:01,160
and initiate some storms.

529
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,160
9:00 nothing, but it
will be a quick change

530
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,080
to the noon hour, getting
started early on these storms

531
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,270
where we do expect some showers

532
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,210
and thunderstorms to bubble up.

533
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,030
Look at this; that's a lotta coverage.

534
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:13,510
While they are widely
scattered, it looks like

535
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,030
a safe bet everyone's gonna see some rain,

536
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,120
at least at some point.

537
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,570
And areas towards our
west really look favored.

538
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:22,441
Here's 5:00 across the I-81
down to the I-64 Corridor.

539
00:19:22,441 --> 00:19:25,500
We are talking about some
heavy rain potential there.

540
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,890
Notice by 9:00, most
of this has faded away.

541
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,570
So, while you might have
some wet grounds out there

542
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:30,710
as you're setting up your lawn chairs

543
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:33,120
to watch the fireworks, we might be okay

544
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,740
if we get this all over
with early, hopefully.

545
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,240
Into Friday we go, and it's
gonna be the same type of thing.

546
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,090
Starting out hazy, late day
showers and thunderstorms fire.

547
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:42,730
We are still just in that pattern.

548
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:43,910
Nothing's changing.

549
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,570
Marginal risk of severe
weather, which means

550
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:47,660
a severe threat isn't too high.

551
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,920
Nothing widespread,
maybe some damaging winds

552
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,180
here and there, but I do think
we have to keep an eye on

553
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,670
the heavy rain threat
and the potential for

554
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,750
maybe some flooding if we
keep getting these storms

555
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,120
one after another tomorrow.

556
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,810
So 92 degrees for that high temperature,

557
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:01,010
scattered showers and
storms on the 4th, sorry.

558
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:02,520
Just the way it is this
year, and you know what?

559
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,720
It's just the way it's gonna stay through

560
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,190
the rest of the holiday weekend.

561
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,250
So, we're not shaking this pattern yet.

562
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,730
Hot, humid, and stormy.

563
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:11,300
Until next week, but I
will tell you, when we get

564
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,590
to next week, the weather
looks much improved.

565
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:16,640
Warmer or dryer, still nice and warm,

566
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,820
but seasonably so with less humidity.

567
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,640
It looks good Monday,
Tuesday, and Wednesday.

568
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,330
And that's your seven
day, have a great 4th.

569
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:23,347
Shawn, over to you.

570
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,700
- President Trump put his feud with

571
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,030
the U.S. Women's Soccer
team on hold, sort of.

572
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,950
The White House said
today, it will send members

573
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,360
of the Trump Administration to France

574
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,300
for the final game on Sunday.

575
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,730
Of course, the U.S. facing
off against the Netherlands.

576
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,580
Last week, the President ranted on Twitter

577
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,580
about midfielder Megan Rapinoe.

578
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,120
Months ago, she said she wouldn't go

579
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,150
to the White House even if the team won.

580
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,620
She also refused to sing
along with the National Anthem

581
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,360
during the World Cup
to show her opposition

582
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,604
to the Trump Administration.

583
00:20:50,604 --> 00:20:51,437
(upbeat music)

584
00:20:51,437 --> 00:20:54,330
Just a reminder, Sunday
is the World Cup Final.

585
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:57,350
Defending champs, Team USA,
will take on the Netherlands.

586
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:01,856
You can watch it live on FOX
5 right here Sunday at 11 a.m.

587
00:21:01,856 --> 00:21:03,790
- Well, it was all about
the burgers at Z-Burger

588
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:04,770
in Tenleytown today.

589
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:06,610
The restaurant holding its 10th Annual

590
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:09,660
Independence Day Burger
Eating Championship.

591
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,580
15 contestants had 10 minutes to eat

592
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,220
as many burgers as possible.

593
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,930
The winner, Molly Skyler,

594
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:20,130
ate 32 and walked away
with the $1500 prize.

595
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:22,303
This is the 5th time she's won that event.

596
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,780
- [Shawn] And we held our very own

597
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,800
FOX 5 Z-Burger Eating
Contest tonight at 10 p.m.

598
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,450
David Brunelli, one of the
top ranked competitive eaters

599
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:31,540
in the world, that's him, right there,

600
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,030
scarfing 'em down.
- Wow.

601
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,460
- [Shawn] He dominated tonight here too.

602
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,820
He beat out our FOX 5 staffers
who gave it their all.

603
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:40,900
A big shout out tonight
to Justin, Lindsay,

604
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,560
Brandon, and Coop.

605
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,770
They gave it their best.
- I love how Lindsay was

606
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:45,603
so dainty.
- She was something.

607
00:21:45,603 --> 00:21:47,540
- [Sarah] She was chewing
and covering her mouth,

608
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,425
something you would not see

609
00:21:48,425 --> 00:21:49,960
in the burger eating championship.

610
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,440
- [Shawn] No, everybody else
was just chuggin' 'em down.

611
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,515
She got about a fourth of a burger in.

612
00:21:54,515 --> 00:21:55,510
(Sarah laughs)
I think the champ

613
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,830
got two and a half.

614
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:59,100
I think Justin got like--
- It's hard.

615
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,250
- Almost all of it
- It's tough, like, there's

616
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,830
a lot of bread involved with that.

617
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:03,882
I don't know how they do it.

618
00:22:03,882 --> 00:22:04,715
- It's just a lot of--
- I really don't.

619
00:22:04,715 --> 00:22:05,548
- It's a lot, I was--
- Look at you.

620
00:22:05,548 --> 00:22:06,600
- Cheering her on.

621
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,320
We called her the silent assassin.

622
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,470
- You were cheering her on?
- I was trying to cheer.

623
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,647
Yeah, I was like, "You've got this, girl.

624
00:22:11,647 --> 00:22:13,013
"Let's go, let's go, let's go."

625
00:22:13,013 --> 00:22:13,846
- [Sarah] Okay, was that what

626
00:22:13,846 --> 00:22:15,190
you were saying?
- Yeah.

627
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:16,107
- Or was it, "Eat more, eat more."

628
00:22:16,107 --> 00:22:16,940
(Shawn laughs)

629
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,645
Like a drill sergeant,

630

631
00:22:19,478 --> 00:22:21,667

(upbeat music)

637
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,870
seems like a no-brainer.

638
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:31,530
People should know to practice
safety behind the wheel.

639
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:33,200
- We're gonna show you

640

693
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,640
- Okay, so ahead of holiday festivities,

694
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,760
here is a reminder not to drink and drive.

695
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,660
A police officer in Ohio
was driving down a road

696
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,060
when another vehicle appeared,

697
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,330
but it was going the wrong way.

698
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:01,160
Police say the driver of that vehicle was

699
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,200
under the influence.

700
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,650
The officer turned on emergency lights,

701
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:08,040
but that did not stop
the driver from slamming

702
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,638
into the officer's patrol car.

703
00:25:09,638 --> 00:25:11,810
Thankfully, no one was
injured, but the driver was,

704
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:15,070
of course, arrested and
faces several charges.

705
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:15,903
- All right, you might wanna

706
00:25:15,903 --> 00:25:16,930
be careful with your cell phone

707
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:18,330
as you celebrate this holiday.

708
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:20,840
Tech company Asurion
says the 4th of July is

709
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,900
the most dangerous time for your phone.

710
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,620
It found phone damage
incidents jumped by about 60%

711
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,840
around Independence Day.

712
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,920
Cracked screens increased by 40%.

713
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,730
Misplaced phones jumped more than 75%.

714
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,670
The worst culprit, water damage.

715
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:37,480
That goes up nearly 250%
during the holiday weekend.

716
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,750
- Keep them away from your pool.

717
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:39,610
All right, if you've been

718
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:40,850
having trouble with some of your

719
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:43,060
social media accounts
today, you're not alone.

720
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,340
People around the world
began reporting issues today

721
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,730
with some of the apps on their phones,

722
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:50,420
specifically Facebook,
Instagram, Twitter, and Whatsapp.

723
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,220
Users reported bugs, such
as images not loading

724
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,140
on Instagram, and problems
with Twitter Direct messages,

725
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,600
including the app
showing notifications for

726
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,160
unread Direct messages that were not there

727
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,780
when users checked their inbox.

728
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,810
It was so frustrating all day today.

729
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,060
How did we live without it? (laughs)

730
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,440
- I don't know, I'm sorry.

731
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,353
I had to, you know, talk
to somebody about it.

732
00:26:10,353 --> 00:26:11,900
- All right, up next, one final check

(people laughing)

785
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,360
All right, so the groom
actually turned to see

his veiled bride, was
actually his little brother.
