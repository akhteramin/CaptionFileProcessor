1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,850
- [Reporter] July 4th, this is not out

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:03,420
of the realm that has happened before.

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,600
- Yeah, it is not that unusual.

4
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,213
We've just seen such
an acceleration, right,

5
00:00:06,213 --> 00:00:08,910
and the way free agency works overall.

6
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,540
We've never seen this much money

7
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,160
committed in the first 24 hours.

8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,340
- No, it's over almost four billion.

9
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,380
- Right, and there you go.

10
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,910
So we're on day four, calm down,

11
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,020
be zen, do what you need to do.

12
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,090
We will get you through
the Kawhilight Zone

13
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:25,080
because we're back later
tonight, at 7:00 eastern.

14
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,430
Come right back, we'll
be here waiting for you.

15
00:00:28,774 --> 00:00:31,357
(upbeat music)

16
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,170
- Straight ahead on Daily Wager,

17
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,880
the dog days of summer are here.

18
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,220
How a holiday heat wave could affect

19
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,630
baseball totals across the next few days

20
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:50,440
and could that sunshine
also affect hotdogs?

21
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,300
The voice of the Nathan's
Hotdog Eating Contest,

22
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,400
joins us to tell you how to
bet the contest, tomorrow.

23
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,060
Plus, we head to Indianapolis
for more football prop bets.

24
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,170
Can Andrew Luck and T.Y. Hilton

25
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,423
take Indy back to the playoffs?

26
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,520
Happy hump day, welcome into Daily Wager.

27
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,720
I am Doug Kezirian, and
we'd also like to welcome

28
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,380
those watching on ESPN2, today.

29
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,130
In case you have never seen
the show, over the next hour,

30
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,670
we hope to make you a more
informed sports bettor.

31
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,140
We have a packed show
coming up and who knows,

32
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,870
Kawhi could maybe make a decision

33
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,700
at any second and that would obviously,

34
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,170
turn the NBA future odds upside down.

35
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,270
Until then, let's get rolling
with the rest of the show,

36
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:33,160
which includes the Subway Series.

37
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,830
First pitch, about an hour away.

38
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,790
Mets beat the Yanks last night,

39
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:41,810
just New York Yankees second
loss in their last 15 games.

40
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,100
Also, the home run record's been snapped.

41
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,870
Tonight, Domingo German makes

42
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,480
his first start since June 7th.

43
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,570
He had an ERA over 8 1/2 in his last

44
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,140
three starts, before a hip injury.

45
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,538
Jason Vargas, Vargas,

46
00:01:55,538 --> 00:01:59,580
he's 2.36 ERA in his last seven starts.

47
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,370
Despite those trends, the
Bombers are favored for the game

48
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:06,660
in the first five and
the run total is 10, 10!

49
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,350
Joe Fortenbaugh joins me
from the Bay Area, here.

50
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,050
Joe, what's your play in this one?

51
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,150
- Doug, it may sound crazy but I like

52
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,790
the Mets at plus 130, in this matchup.

53
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,550
The Yanks scored just two runs

54
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,550
in that game, last
night, against the Mets.

55
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:24,020
That was just the third
time in their last 39 games

56
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,110
that they scored two or fewer runs.

57
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:29,100
Now, a lot of that is due
credit to Zack Wheeler,

58
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,440
in the Met bullpen, which
showed up last night

59
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,380
but I gotta wonder, after
that series across the pond

60
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,310
against the Red Sox, maybe
there's a little jet lag

61
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,850
and fatigue at play here, for the Yankees,

62
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,260
so I'm gonna keep that in mind.

63
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,650
As you mentioned, it's the lefty,

64
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:44,850
Jason Vargas, pitching
for the Mets tonight.

65
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:49,190
Two or fewer earned runs in
10 of 13 starts this year.

66
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:52,540
The Mets are six and two in
his last eight home starts

67
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,740
and not only that, the Yanks are just 24th

68
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,130
in OPS against left-handed pitching

69
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:00,180
and will be without Edwin
Encarnacion tonight.

70
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,300
So you add it all up, I like
the Mets here at plus 130.

71
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,450
- All right, sounds good
and just to give you

72
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,770
a little push back, Joe, I've
heard the whole jet lag thing

73
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,180
but the Boston Red Sox did put up 10 runs

74
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,790
last night or maybe the Blue Jays

75
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,890
were just that bad
yesterday, we shall see.

76
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:13,723
So, you're on the Mets.

77
00:03:13,723 --> 00:03:14,750
I know I talked you into the first

78
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,920
five yesterday, my apologies.

79
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,960
Yanks, Mets, though just
one of five games tonight

80
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,740
with a total of at least 10 runs.

81
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:27,620
Astros, Rockies, leading the
way with a total of 14 1/2.

82
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:32,070
They combine for 17 last
night, at Coors Field.

83
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,750
Let's go out to Las Vegas.

84
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,040
Preston Johnson joins me

85
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,430
from Planet Hollywood,
overlooking Caesers.

86
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,580
Preston, what do your
numbers have an edge on,

87
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,863
in terms of all those high over/unders?

88
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,320
- It's the Astros, Rockies under 14 1/2.

89
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,790
My projection is 13.1
runs and that accounts

90
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,950
for nine mile per hour
winds to dead center.

91
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,040
It accounts for the fact,

92
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,217
they're obviously playing at Coors Field,

93
00:03:54,217 --> 00:03:55,940
and we even talked about yesterday,

94
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,660
it's crazy having these Astros bats,

95
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,280
which are so much better than the Rockies,

96
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,010
hitting in Coors Field, and I still,

97
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,320
looking at this number, think
this is way too drastic,

98
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,200
and you look at the pitching
match of Wade Miley.

99
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,540
I mean this guy's been
just stellar for two years

100
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,270
and if you say, oh, someone
from the American League

101
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,890
pitching in Coors for the first time,

102
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:11,910
he was with the Diamondbacks,

103
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,460
he's accustomed to pitching in Coors.

104
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,290
He even pitched there last year,
when he was at the Brewers.

105
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,660
So he has some reps there at Coors Field.

106
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,620
I don't think that's gonna mess him up.

107
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,800
He's 75th percentile, league
wide and hard hit percentage.

108
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,800
Waited on base against, expected
batting average against,

109
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,590
all of these metrics
and on the other side,

110
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:28,750
Lambert, I mean he's a rookie.

111
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,680
He hasn't been pitching too well

112
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,430
but he's the number one
prospect for the Rockies.

113
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:34,430
That is the concern some, is
that the Astros just go nuts.

114
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,820
But 14, that's way to drastic.

115
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,210
I have it right at 13
almost, I gotta go under.

116
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,340
- All right, and on those
lists of double digit totals,

117
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,130
if I had to pick one, I'd go over 11 1/2

118
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,350
with the Phillies and Braves.

119
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,420
Both pitchers have really struggled.

120
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,007
Bryse Wilson, ERA over
eight, Nick Pivetta,

121
00:04:49,007 --> 00:04:51,720
at ERA over seven in
his last three starts.

122
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,810
I know it's an umpire
that would favor pitchers

123
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,090
instead of batters here, but
I'm not gonna overthink it.

124
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,950
I'll take the over, in that one.

125
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,980
Preston, sit tight for that.

126
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,020
And Joe, what about you on
that list of over/unders,

127
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,320
the double digits, which
one jumps out to you?

128
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,860
- The second half of the White
Sox, Tigers, doubleheader.

129
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:13,700
I'm going under 10 1/2 runs,
due largely to the unknown

130
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,200
variety of pitchers that
we're seeing tonight.

131
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,780
For the Tigers, it's going
to be Tyler Alexander,

132
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,990
the rookie southpaw.

133
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:25,890
Opponents hit just 234 against
him in the month of June.

134
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,550
There's virtually no tape on the kid,

135
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,070
no experience that the White
Sox will have against him.

136
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,560
So perhaps, the second
half of the doubleheader,

137
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,480
they're tired, they've been
out on the diamond all day.

138
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,820
This kid will be able to take advantage

139
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,470
of them a little bit and not only that,

140
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,130
Chicago's about middle of the pack

141
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:42,240
in OPS, against left-handed pitching.

142
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,760
Now, on the other side of the equation,

143
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,600
it's gonna be Ross
Detwiler, who just earned

144
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,880
his first Major League Baseball

145
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,950
victory in nearly three years.

146
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,930
His first time out, just a week ago,

147
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,270
went up against Minnesota,
looked really sharp,

148
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,140
gave up just two earned runs
in five innings pitched.

149
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,380
He'll go up against the
Tiger lineup tonight.

150
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,480
That's 25th in OPS, against
left-handed pitching.

151
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,440
So, I think the pitchers
have a little bit of success.

152
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,320
We play the under, in 10
1/2 runs, White Sox, Tigers.

153
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,280
- All right, sounds good.

154
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,910
Sit tight, Joe, much more from both you

155
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,190
and Preston throughout the show.

156
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:13,490
And we've talked college
football in recent shows,

157
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:16,040
Big Ten yesterday, also covered the SEC.

158
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,810
Let's do a little ACC.

159
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,010
Here's a look at your highest,
six highest win totals,

160
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,420
courtesy of Caesars,
for the coming season.

161
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,840
No surprise, Clemson with a sizeable gap

162
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,510
over the rest of the conference,

163
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:30,580
11 1/2 minus 110, either side.

164
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,500
Obviously, Trevor Lawrence returns

165
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,540
for the defending national champions.

166
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,280
Miami at 8 1/2, Virginia Tech at eight,

167
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,370
and a trio of NC State,
Syracuse, and Virginia,

168
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,250
all at 7 1/2, with varying juices on that.

169
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,610
Let's welcome in The Bear, Chris
Fallica and Stanford Steve.

170
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,780
I knew you guys were close if
I mentioned college football.

171
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,613
- Absolutely, let's get it going.

172
00:06:49,613 --> 00:06:50,765
- You ready to fire away?

173
00:06:50,765 --> 00:06:55,083
I'm gonna start with the
defending champs, Clemson, 11 1/2.

174
00:06:56,092 --> 00:06:56,960
- Under.

175
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,960
- Over, look this is FPI,
our Football Power Index

176
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:04,710
projects them to win all
their games by at least 20,

177
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:08,570
except for two, home to A&M, and that's 15

178
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,770
and then at South Carolina, 18.

179
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:13,120
So, all of them by at
least two touchdowns.

180
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,550
Their only questionable games are at home

181
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,150
or just not, it should be wire to wire.

182
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,010
I think Alabama being in the race.

183
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:21,920
They're gonna hear a lot about that.

184
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,480
We'll keep them on point
and we tend to think,

185
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,520
oh, Clemson always will drop one.

186
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,120
Well, they didn't last year
so we can't assume that,

187
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,140
and I think over 11 1/2.

188
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,810
- Last four years of regular
season, they've lost twice.

189
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:36,350
Both of them have been,
is 19, 20 point favorites.

190
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,941
- And this is offense.
- The whole Clemsoning thing,

191
00:07:38,941 --> 00:07:41,290
oh, I gotta, that's long gone.

192
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,240
Their offense is great.

193
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,760
The only thing that I,

194
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,190
I would play the over on that, as well.

195
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:48,380
The only thing I think that
could trip them up is an injury,

196
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,500
which nobody wants to see,

197
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,669
but they're just so much
better than everybody

198
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:52,550
on the schedule.
- The schedule's been

199
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,510
they get A&M at home,
that's key, obviously.

200
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,343
- Yep.

201
00:07:55,343 --> 00:07:57,310
- The schedule's really favorable
for them to run the table.

202
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,450
- I think what makes it favorable,

203
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,190
we're gonna get to it with
our teams, also though,

204
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,850
but I think the conference is terrible.

205
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,200
- Brutal.
- It is awful.

206
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,350
- Fire away.
- All right, I'll start,

207
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,110
but on the other side,

208
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,020
I look at Florida State, okay.

209
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,723
Now, they were a disaster last year, okay.

210
00:08:11,723 --> 00:08:13,980
- Yes.
- They won five games.

211
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,120
They started nine different combinations

212
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,903
on the offensive line, okay.

213
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,720
Quarterbacks were coming
in and out of there.

214
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,700
Defensively, they were awful.

215
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,838
They didn't rank in the top 100
in any defensive categories.

216
00:08:26,838 --> 00:08:28,650
- They were on the field,
short fields every,

217
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:29,860
off from the ball point.
- On offense,

218
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:34,190
I think they averaged 260
yards a game, 21 points.

219
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:37,470
Those weren't good in
any top 100 categories,

220
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,950
but I look at the experience,
I look at the value

221
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,800
of the recruits that they still had.

222
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,680
Those guys were all
playing out of position

223
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,520
because of injuries and what have you,

224
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,140
and guys just having to have to play

225
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:48,973
to fill the rosters.
- There was disarray

226
00:08:48,973 --> 00:08:50,160
through the coaching team.
- They're so,

227
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,650
yeah, absolutely.
- There's a lot of reasons.

228
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,530
- But with the combination
of the roster, okay,

229
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:58,670
and then the schedule,
okay, I think it's doable.

230
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:01,160
The number is seven, they
have the talent to do it.

231
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,880
When you look at the
schedule, five of the teams

232
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,360
won nine games last year
but that's a big drop off.

233
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,700
Those teams lost a lot of
games and I think it's pretty

234
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,290
favorable when you look at everything.

235
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,540
I take three games that aren't winnable,

236
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:17,980
at Clemson, at Florida, at Virginia.

237
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,890
- We talked last week,
about those week one lies,

238
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,810
when they came out and
Boise State, Florida State,

239
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,630
was one of the games that
Doug and I talked about.

240
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,210
I think what you're mentioning,

241
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,610
I like Florida State in that game.

242
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:29,740
You can not go to Virginia with the chance

243
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,440
to potentially be wanting
to, right off the bat,

244
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,080
offer the year that you had
last year, but you're right.

245
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,920
You think Kendal Briles, maybe
biggest coordinator hire,

246
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,610
going into the 2008, maybe him,

247
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,710
or maybe Alex Grinch at Oklahoma.

248
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:45,090
- Yeah, I mean, what he has
to play with, Blackman--

249
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,550
- Terry.
- Experienced two years ago.

250
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,740
Terry's a A1 receiver.
- Willie Taggart can recruit.

251
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,740
He's demonstrated that--
- Absolutely.

252
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,780
- In the state of Florida and
he finally gets another year

253
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,830
under his belt to
implement all those guys.

254
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,150
- And I will ask the question,

255
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,087
who do you think is gonna come in?

256
00:09:56,087 --> 00:09:59,380
Not who's gonna play Clemson
in an ACC title game.

257
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,900
Who's the second best
team, when you look at it?

258
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,270
Three months ago, you asked the question

259
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,100
when we did a Kentucky
Derby podcast and I'm like,

260
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,480
I don't know, Syracuse,
they looked great last year.

261
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,470
- FPI says 8.1 win, so they side with you.

262
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,160
Bear, what--
- Early lean.

263
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:13,993
- Early lean, okay.

264
00:10:13,993 --> 00:10:16,930
What about you, Bear?
- Last year, Steve and I were,

265
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:19,206
Bullet Shawn B, see we
love Addazio's dudes.

266
00:10:19,206 --> 00:10:20,039
- Love them.

267
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:21,590
- We went over the six and they cashed.

268
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:25,140
Problem this year at BC,
Addazio's dudes are gone.

269
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,900
The offensive line is gone.

270
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,150
Ray, Strahan, all those
guys in defense, gone.

271
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,550
I'm on the under this year with BC.

272
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:35,000
I just look, I think as AJ Dillon went,

273
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,790
and then the injury to quarterback,
the Eagles offense went.

274
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:41,480
I just don't know if you can
line up an offensive line

275
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,810
and just run Dillon 35
times like they want to.

276
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,580
They got a coordinator
change on both sides

277
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,740
of the ball so we'll see how that goes.

278
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,640
But Addazio, they've been a six

279
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,250
or a seven win every year, under him.

280
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,310
You'll have the Virginia Tech game

281
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:56,460
to start the year, will be tough.

282
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,230
They should win the next three.

283
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:01,440
I'm high on Wake Forest, I think the Deacs

284
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,270
are gonna be really good but
look at the way they finish.

285
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,840
I mean, those final five games,

286
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,320
if they haven't gotten
to seven by the time

287
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,713
they go to Clemson, I don't
think they're gonna get it.

288
00:11:09,713 --> 00:11:11,510
- Goodnight, yeah, exactly.

289
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,750
I mean, look at the difference.

290
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,150
That's a Florida State team
and a Boston College team.

291
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,700
Look at the difference in the schedules.

292
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,840
That's why I like
Florida State, it's over,

293
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,050
and you're like, BC's under.

294
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,410
- And why a team like Florida State,

295
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:23,120
you can be so high on and
then exceeding the number.

296
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,440
They recruit so well, they reload.

297
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,890
It's not like BC has been
recruiting these great, great.

298
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:27,723
- No, limited.

299
00:11:27,723 --> 00:11:29,600
- They develop players, they find guys

300
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,440
who they can get into their system

301
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,813
and they're a young offensive
line and a lot of turnover.

302
00:11:35,658 --> 00:11:37,930
I'm thinking get into a bowl this year

303
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,030
with six wins would be a good job.

304
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,600
- Of all the ACC teams--
- Really good.

305
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,290
- Between Vegas and what
they project, biggest delta,

306
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,930
biggest difference is
BC to the under, 5.1.

307
00:11:46,905 --> 00:11:48,563
- And I think it's like a--

308
00:11:48,563 --> 00:11:49,590
- You got a calculator over there?

00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,270
- A spreadsheet here.
(laughing)

310
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,160
My computer--
- It's a map, Steve.

311
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,830
He probably did take it at Stanford.

312
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,950
- I still will say, Virginia and I

313
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,650
have a thing, they look good.

314
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,310
- Yeah, all right, well fortunately,

315
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,640
- We've broke up like that.
- We have plenty of time.

316
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,520
We got game one lines, or
week one lines we can dissect,

317
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,160
as well, throughout
the rest of the summer.

318

Bear and Stanford Steve
here, in the house.

319
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,330
We all like a little tennis action,

320
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,780
especially in the morning, right,

321
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,773
not a lot on, fire away on.

322
00:12:13,773 --> 00:12:15,330
- Give me that money!
- Brad Gilbert

323
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:18,550
as we think about Wimbledon
underdogs, galore.

324
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:21,970
We'll have Patrick McEnroe
next, with some picks.

325
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:26,340
Also, props for Colts
players, courtesy of Caesars.

326
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,360
Where do you stand on Andrew Luck

327
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,113
passing touchdowns this year, 32 1/2.

328
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,961
We'll break it down as
Daily Wager rolls on.

329
00:12:34,961 --> 00:12:37,544

398

Today at Wimbledon, recapping
just some of the action.

399
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,367
But hey, the biggest story
probably is Coco Gauff,

400
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:50,720
the 15 year old American, what a story.

401
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,180
She won today as a plus 155 underdog,

402
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,820
a pick that Brad Gilbert gave
out yesterday on this show.

403
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,390
So, she moves on to the third round,

404
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:03,210
she'll face Polona Hercog.

405
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,950
So we gave that one out
yesterday, as a winner.

406
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,540
What about what else is going on?

407
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,290
Lots of upsets so far but
the big names do remain

408
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:12,330
and are in action tomorrow
in the second round.

409
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:15,230
Roger Federer, minus 20,000 favorite

410
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,860
against Britain's Jay Clarke.

411
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,590
Fed was minus 15,000 in the first round.

412
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:23,640
Rafael Nadal, looking for a
second straight Grand Slam win,

413
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,800
not nearly as big of a favorite, minus 360

414
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,920
against Australia, Nick Kyrgios.

415
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,550
Those players have split
six career meetings.

416
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,340
Kyrgios did win the last,
and on the women's side,

417
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:38,490
11th seed, Serena Williams
is going to face a qualifier.

418
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:42,810
She's a perfect 18 and O
in second round matches

419
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:47,680
in the All England Club and
is a minus 750 favorite.

420
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,610
So let's take a look at some
of the other notable matchups

421
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:56,143
as we, that catch our eye,
Angelique Kerber, minus 950.

422
00:16:56,143 --> 00:16:58,090
Hey, you don't like the big juice,

423
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:58,980
you don't wanna lay the lumber,

424
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,220
you could always do a money line parlay,

425
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,320
and Sam Querrey with the upset,

426
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,060
is now minus 460 in his second match.

427
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:12,060
As for the couple of potential
upsets in other picks,

428
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,263
let's turn it over to our Patrick McEnroe.

429
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:19,257
- Expecting more beautiful
weather on day four at Wimbledon

430
00:17:19,257 --> 00:17:21,780
and the match we've all been
waiting for on the men's side

431
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,290
in round two will be
between the two-time champ,

432
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:27,560
Rafael Nadal and the
wacky one from Australia,

433
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,360
Nick Kyrgios, who can also play

434
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,730
some serious tennis,
particularly on grass.

435
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:35,620
Remember a couple of years
ago, Kyrgios upset Nadal,

436
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,690
right here at Wimbledon on center court.

437
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,330
I'm not expecting that to happen tomorrow.

438
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,700
I think Nadal's ready for this,

439
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,830
having won his 12th French
Open, he's got some confidence.

440
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,960
Of course, this is his
least favorite surface.

441
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,830
The favorite surface for Kyrgios,

442
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,410
but he does not look like the player

443
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,980
he was a couple of years ago.

444
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,570
I expected Nadal to maybe drop a set,

445
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:56,390
but probably win this one in four sets.

446
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,050
On the ladies side, Sloane Stephens,

447
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,670
she's a number nine seed here.

448
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,400
She'll try to celebrate the Fourth of July

449
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,700
with a second round win, taking
on Wang Yafan from China,

450
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,950
who's a solid player, ranked
in the high 50s in the world.

451
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:11,050
But I think Stephens,
despite playing on a surface

452
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,870
which hasn't been her best over the years,

453
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,580
she looked good in round number one.

454
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,480
I expect her to win
comfortably in straight sets.

455
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,730
Back to you, Doug.

456
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,810
- All right, Patrick,
thanks so much and look,

457
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:24,010
it's Independence Day and
fire away in the morning,

458
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:26,440
throughout the afternoon,
and you got some baseball

459
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,010
on July 4th, but that is the
best part about Wimbledon.

460
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:30,660
The women's soccer we've talked about,

461
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,170
action throughout the day.

462
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:34,870
You can fire away on
more than 10 1/2 hours

463
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:37,670
of second round play, ESPN, ESPN+,

464
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:40,703
and always streaming live on the ESPN app.

465
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,590
And we've been talking a
lot of pro football props,

466
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,920
doing tours of each division.

467
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,170
We're doing the South Divisions this week.

468
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,840
AFC South, here with
the Colts player props,

469
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,310
courtesy of Caesars.

470
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:56,550
Andrew Luck's passing
touchdown total, 32 1/2.

471
00:18:56,550 --> 00:19:00,410
He's gone over just twice
in his five full seasons.

472
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:03,350
Marlon Mack needs a
1,000 yard rushing season

473
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,770
to go over his total.

474
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:07,500
The Colts have had one, 1,000 yard rush

475
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:12,270
in the last decade, that
was Frank Gore in 2016.

476
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,770
Let's bring in now, our male modelers,

477
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:18,120
Preston Johnson and Mike
Clay, who have spreadsheets

478
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,000
and laptops in hand,
as we break this down.

479
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,300
Andrew Luck, 32 TD passes.

480
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,210
We'll start with you, Mike.

481
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:25,680
What do your numbers say here?

482
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,430
- Definitely going over on this one.

483
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,970
This guy is 39 passing
touchdowns last season.

484
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:32,170
That was second most in
the NFL, behind only,

485
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:34,470
some guy named Patrick Mahomes,
you may have heard of him.

486
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:37,610
The last time we saw Andrew
Luck for a full 16 game season,

487
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:40,050
he had 40 passing touchdowns and really,

488
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,170
the key here is opportunity.

489
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:43,620
You have a stat, OTD,
which looks at essentially,

490
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:47,200
expected passing touchdowns
based on your opportunity,

491
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,680
where you are on the field,
your volume of throws.

492
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,300
Luck, last year, topped
in the NFL at 34.0.

493
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,870
The key, throws them to the end zone.

494
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,510
The Colts had 50 last season.

495
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,860
That was most in the league.

496
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:00,690
This offense sets up for him
to throw a ton of touchdowns.

497
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:01,523
- All right, sounds good.

498
00:20:01,523 --> 00:20:03,320
Preston, what do your projections have?

499
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,070
- You guys know, we do this
every day and I'm generally,

500
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,620
pretty married to my projections
and I had Andrew Luck

501
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,330
come in at 28 touchdowns
and I couldn't believe it,

502
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:15,517
and there's no way I'm
betting under on this, though.

503
00:20:15,517 --> 00:20:17,680
You look at it and I agree with Mike.

504
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,570
There's so much value
here with Andrew Luck,

505
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:21,290
assuming he plays a full season.

506
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:23,090
I'm not sure how he
doesn't go over 32 1/2.

507
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:25,480
So I actually, am staying off of this,

508
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,040
despite my projections pointing
to an edge, on the under,

509
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,470
but because I am lower on
Andrew Luck's projections,

510
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:31,940
there are some correlated bets

511
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,960
which we'll get to here in a bit,

512
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,780
which I think are safer and better,

513
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,530
as far as some of these receivers go.

514
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:38,210
- I like that gut check and especially

515
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,930
with the offensive line improving

516
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,050
over the last couple of seasons.

517
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:43,560
His health is more likely,
obviously, to stay intact.

518
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,560
T.Y. Hilton, receiving yards, 1,210 1/2.

519
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,330
Mike, we'll start with
you, what do you got?

520
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,130
- Well, I'm going over
on this one, for sure.

521
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:53,080
I mean, you look back at
the last three seasons

522
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,330
that T.Y. Hilton and Andrew Luck

523
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,150
have played together in full.

524
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:58,920
Hilton has blown this nuffer
away all three seasons

525
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,620
and there's a few things in play here.

526
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,530
One of them is durability.

527
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:04,100
He's missed four games in
seven seasons, in the league.

528
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,540
He's finished top 17 in receiving yards

529
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,330
each of the past six seasons and guys,

530
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:10,320
he's been in the 80th percentile or better

531
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,130
in yards per reception, each
of the past five seasons.

532
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,510
It's Andrew Luck's go-to guy.

533
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:18,340
This is a high volume, pass heavy offense.

534
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,490
Hilton, I think, gets
to this number easily.

535
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:21,990
- All right, Preston, and you?

536
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,560
- This is one where we disagree.

537
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,700
So I'm correlated here

538
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,030
with not really loving
Andrew Luck's numbers

539
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:31,800
but Hilton, I have at 1,140 yards.

540
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,860
So for me, there is a
slight edge to the under.

541
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,080
Then you actually just look at the scope

542
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,570
of who Luck will be throwing to.

543
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,620
They went out of their way
to bring in Devin Funchess.

544
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,190
They drafted Parris Campbell
in the second round,

545
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,240
out of Ohio State, who I
think's gonna be stellar.

546
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,400
Then you have Eric Ebron, who played

547
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,370
a bunch last year in tight end.

548
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,330
Well, they have a second
tight end named Jack Doyle,

549
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:47,740
who missed a lot of last season.

550
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,730
He'll be an option, as well.

551
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:50,140
I have those two tight ends combined,

552
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,270
projected for over 140 targets.

553
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,720
So for me, I think T.Y. Hilton's

554
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,310
total target share is going down.

555
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,580
I have him under 1,200 yards.

556
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,070
So I like it at 1,210 1/2,
it's a bet under for me.

557
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,180
- All right, so you guys disagree there.

558
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,110
I like that, I like
that you would disagree.

559
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,810
Mike, let's go to you, Marlon Mack,

560
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:06,400
will he be a 1,000 yard rusher again?

561
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,690
Not combined, just rushing yards.

562
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:11,000
- Yes, he will and he
sort of was last year,

563
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,220
if you look at his 14 games
including the playoffs.

564
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,940
He had a little over
1,100 yards and again,

565
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,880
that was with playing a situational roll,

566
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,530
for a lot of the early part of the season.

567
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:22,830
The guy has been terrific
since he's entered the league,

568
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,686
and 4.8 yards per carry, last season.

569
00:22:24,686 --> 00:22:26,630
You don't wanna get too
wrapped up in yards per carry

570
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:28,430
but he's been above averaging yards

571
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,390
after contact per attempt
in both of his NFL seasons.

572
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,960
He's got a lot of help before contact,

573
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,920
last season, from Quenton Nelson, as well.

574
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,753
And here's the big one,

575
00:22:35,753 --> 00:22:37,360
we know volume is king for running backs.

576
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,720
In his last five games, last season,

577
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,230
he handled at least 75% of the Colts

578
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:44,320
designed runs in each of those games.

579
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,160
The guy is working his way into becoming

580
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,850
a two-down workhorse
for this Colt's offense.

581
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:49,820
I like the over, a lot here.

582
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,870
- All right, so Mike, you're certainly

583
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,250
bullish on the Colts offense.

584
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:55,135
Preston, you mentioned Eric
Ebron just a moment ago,

585
00:22:55,135 --> 00:22:57,940
6 1/2 touchdowns for his prop.

586
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,483
Where are you headed with this?

587
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,080
- This is another gut check
but I'm going with it.

588
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,170
I have projected 5.2 touchdowns.

589
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:07,080
I mentioned that Jack Doyle is back.

590
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,210
He should be healthier and
I project him to have a good

591
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:10,780
portion as a second tight end,

592
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,210
of his potential target share.

593
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:15,230
I think Devin Funchess, I
mean, this guy is 6'4", 240,

594
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,860
as far as red zone opportunities go

595
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,197
and goal line opportunities,
Funchess, Doyle, and Ebron.

596
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:22,240
Ebron, outside of last year,
where he scored 13 touchdowns,

597
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,200
this is why it's a gut check, under 6 1/2,

598
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,160
he never got more than five
touchdowns in a season.

599
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,520
That was in Detroit, and
Matthew Stafford's not inept.

600
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,470
So for me, I just think there's
so much going around here

601
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,080
now, for Luck, he has so many weapons.

602
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,980
I gotta go under Ebron.

603
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,600
I don't think we'll see
what we did last year.

604
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,040
- And again, a little technicality,
it's total touchdowns.

605
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,070
So it includes a, maybe an inside handoff,

606
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:41,687
a recovered fumble in the goal
line, something like that,

607
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:42,520
so it's total touchdown.
- There you go.

608
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,640
That changes everything.
- Yeah, I know.

609
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,473
Yeah, you wanna go back

610
00:23:44,473 --> 00:23:46,020
to your spreadsheet and reevaluate it.

611
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,160
Mike, thank you very much.

612
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,260
More to come from Preston, straight ahead.

613
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:55,340
And from player props to team
props, Indy's win total is 10,

614
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,530
which is what they won last year.

615
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:02,200
The over, plus 110 and the
yes, no, to make the playoffs.

616
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:07,200
Yes, is minus $1.75, which
they sure in fact did

617
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,100
in Frank Reich's first
season with the Colts.

618
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,100
Let's go out to New York and
bring in our Anita Marks.

619
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,680
Anita, over/under 10, now, I am passing

620
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,070
'cause I think it's gonna be right there.

621
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:20,440
They have to face the NFC
South, really tough schedule,

622
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,400
supposed to be competitive division,

623
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,780
so I think it's gonna
be right around there.

624
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,543
So I'm gonna pass, what about you?

625
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:29,300
- I'm on the over, a little bit.

626
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:33,010
I'm not banking the mortgage
on the over but I am putting

627
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:35,010
a little money on the over
for a number of reasons.

628
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:36,020
Let's talk about the schedule.

629
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,070
Let's take a look at
the schedule, actually.

630
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,890
I have them winning their
division, the AFC South.

631
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:42,490
I think they split with Houston.

632
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:44,570
I think they go two and
O against Tennessee.

633
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:47,170
They could possibly go two
and O against the Jaguars.

634
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:48,690
So I'm looking at five and one,

635
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:50,300
four and three in their division,

636
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,980
easy games, with all due respect

637
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,500
to Oakland, Denver, and Miami.

638
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,790
Here's where it gets tough.

639
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,517
Look at their road games,

640
00:24:56,517 --> 00:24:58,960
and the quarterbacks they're
gonna be facing, you ready?

641
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,550
The Chargers, the Chiefs,
the Steelers, the Texans,

642
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:04,550
the Saints, it's a tough road game.

643
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:07,510
I have them going three
and two on the road.

644
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:09,630
So it's gonna be close
but I think this team

645
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:14,180
is just so good, Doug, that
I have them at 10, 11 win.

646
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,960
So I'm putting a little money on the over.

647
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,570
- All right, sounds good, that's fair.

648
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:19,840
I was definitely leaning
that way but I'm gonna pass.

649
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,270
Now, as for the yes, no, I like the yes,

650
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,810
to make the playoffs at minus $1.75.

651
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:26,620
A little different here than the division

652
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:29,270
because you could get to the playoffs

653
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:32,170
and not get over 10 wins, nine or 10 wins

654
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:35,010
in this division could win it.

655
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:37,340
So I'm gonna say, I like the yes,

656
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,270
to make the playoffs at minus $1.75.

657
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:41,600
Obviously, you have the
bonus of the wild card

658
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,550
but that's why I'm
differentiating between that

659
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:45,620
and over 10 wins, what about you?

660
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,580
- Again, I have them
winning this division.

661
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,640
I love this team, out of all
the 22 starters of course,

662
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,990
on offense and defense,
they only have one guy

663
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:55,130
not coming back, that's amazing.

664
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:58,490
That just doesn't happen in
this day and age in free agency.

665
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:01,660
On top of that, they are one
of the most balanced teams

666
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:05,720
in the NFL, first and third
down conversions in 2018.

667
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,480
Andrew Luck, when he's healthy,
he's a top five quarterback.

668
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,700
He's got the best
offensive line coming in,

669
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,810
wide receivers, you've
gotta love T.Y. Hilton.

670
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:14,910
They add Devin Funchess, he's gonna be

671
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:16,040
a stud in the red zone.

672
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:19,150
They draft Parris Campbell,
he's a speedy wide receiver.

673
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:21,620
I love their one-two punch
with their tight ends.

674
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:24,860
Eric Ebron took a big
step with them this year

675
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,960
as opposed to what we saw in Detroit.

676
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,330
Jack Doyle, he's gonna be
healthy and then they add

677
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:32,980
Justin Houston on the
defensive side of the ball,

678
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:35,140
so, I just, I love this team.

679
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,450
I think they're gonna make the playoffs.

680
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:37,920
I think they win the division, Doug.

681
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,200
- Sounds like we're all
very positive on the Colts.

I have one question for you.

699
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,450
What size socks do you wear?

700
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:37,980
If you're like everyone else we've asked,

701
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,060
just simply don't know, how could you.

702
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:43,030
All sock companies make their
socks in one size fits all

703
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:46,140
or just a couple of sizes
to fit every size foot.

704
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:50,610
At Kane 11, we make our socks
to fit 11 individual sizes,

705
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:54,763
from seven to 17, that's

00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,460
Hey, better lucky than good.

772
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:29,710
All right, so five and
two for the week, we are,

773
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:32,533
and let's keep the momentum going.

774
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,700
Here at the desk, Stanford Steve here,

775
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,630
standing by for your best bet.

776
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:39,880
We'll get that in a moment

777
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,740
but let's go back out to Las Vegas.

778
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,780
Preston, what do you
have for your best bet?

779
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,083
You're on the T-box first.

780
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,880
- I'm going to the Summer League.

781
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,170
In the NBA, the Grizzlies minus
2 1/2 against the Cavaliers,

782
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:54,500
who we fitted on Monday against the Spurs.

783
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,060
We talked about their inexperience,

784
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,730
the only guy getting run
that has any pro experience

785
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:01,500
is Nas Mutulong, who played
a total of 85 minutes

786
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,180
for the Jazz the last two years.

787
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,230
On the other side, this Memphis team,

788
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,530
there's a roster filled
with a bunch of guys

789
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:09,150
who played fairly regular minutes

790
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:11,290
the last two seasons
when Memphis was tanking.

791
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:13,460
Ivan Rabb, Washburn,
Watanabe, Jevon Carter,

792
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,720
these guys took total, 63 points,

793
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,860
I think, on Monday when they played.

794
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,880
They all rested yesterday.

795
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,900
Now, Carter, worth noting,
actually just got traded

796
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,220
to the Suns, probably won't
play because they can't afford

797
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,270
him to get injured but these
other three guys combined,

798
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:27,170
with 34 points, they
have so much experience

799
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:29,360
compared to the Cavs, who are
playing a bunch of rookies.

800
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,957
It doesn't impact the projection too much.

801
00:31:30,957 --> 00:31:32,850
It should be more like minus five.

802
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,630
We're getting two, 2 1/2
out there on the market.

803
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:35,810
So I'm going with the Grizzlies.

804
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,850
- [Steve] You believe
in rest days in Vegas,

805
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:39,576
come on, or was that in Salt Lake?

806
00:31:39,576 --> 00:31:41,600
(laughing)

807
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,882
- This one's in Salt Lake.

808
00:31:42,882 --> 00:31:44,167
- [Steve] All right, a
little different, right.

809
00:31:44,167 --> 00:31:45,000
- The altitude.

810
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,340
- [Doug] Yeah, a little different
extracurricular activity,

811
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,040
fewer distractions, I would say.

812
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,945
- [Steve] You would
think, you would think,

813
00:31:51,945 --> 00:31:52,860
never know.
- You never know.

814
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:53,830
All right, so Preston's playing

815
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:56,430
to his home court advantage
out there in Las Vegas.

816
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:58,380
Joe, what do you got for your best bet?

817
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:03,110
- The San Francisco Giants at plus 120

818
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,770
over the San Diego Padres,

819
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,250
as they look for the sweep tonight.

820
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:09,240
The Giant bats have
come alive, as of late.

821
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,680
Three straight wins, all of
which featured 10 or more runs.

822
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,940
Now tonight, the Padres,
who ranked 19th in OPS

823
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:19,520
are gonna face Giant
right-hander, Shaun Anderson.

824
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,810
Anderson has been the most consistent

825
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:23,630
pitcher for the Giants this season.

826
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:25,840
A lot of people may think
that's Madison Bumgarner

827
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,670
but Bumgarner's been up and
down through the months.

828
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:31,130
Anderson's made nine starts, giving up two

829
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:33,190
or fewer runs in six of those starts.

830
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:36,180
Go back to June 12th,
he faces Padre lineup,

831
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:39,430
four hits, two were in runs
in six innings pitched.

832
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:41,270
He's gonna take the mound for the Giants,

833
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,270
which is the big edge here.

834
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:44,230
I think he's extremely undervalued

835
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:45,350
at this point in the season.

836
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:47,530
For the Padres, it's
gonna be the youngster,

837
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:51,470
Cal Quantrill, the righty
pitching against San Francisco.

838
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,800
He's coming out of the bullpen
to make his first start

839
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,070
in a few weeks, six starts this season.

840
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:58,300
He's got an ERA north of five,

841
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:01,080
18 earned runs in just 31 innings pitched.

842
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,080
So, I like the Giants
to get the sweep tonight

843
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,380
and then they're off tomorrow,

844
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:08,380
first time off on July 4th since 1941.

845
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,730
Giants plus 120, you can book it.

846
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:11,730
- All right, and the Giants bats

847
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:13,320
have been hot a little bit, in San Diego.

848
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,470
So, we got Preston in Vegas,
picking a Summer League game.

849
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:18,600
- Yeah, Grizzlies, Giants, parlay.

850
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,990
- So Joe, in the Bay
Area, taking the Giants.

851
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:23,730
Are you going the
tri-state area for yours?

852
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:24,563
- Absolutely.

853
00:33:24,563 --> 00:33:25,530
- All right, staying true to form here.

854
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:26,900
- The Mets aren't gonna win the season

855
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,854
series from the almighty Yankees.

856
00:33:28,854 --> 00:33:29,687
- Yes.

857
00:33:29,687 --> 00:33:32,044
- First time since 2013,
that's not gonna happen.

858
00:33:32,044 --> 00:33:32,877
- No sir.

859
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:34,830
- Lemans back on the
mound for the Yankees,

860
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:35,663
take the Yankees.

861
00:33:35,663 --> 00:33:38,290
- Vargas throwing well, lately, no.

862
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:39,123
- Really.

863
00:33:39,123 --> 00:33:39,956
- All right, so you're sticking

864
00:33:39,956 --> 00:33:41,830
to the home team, so to speak, Preston.

865
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,900
I'm going with my team
and where I'm gonna be

866
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,790
this holiday weekend, I'm
going with the Dodgers.

867
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:48,620
Look, I got lucky last
night, first one to admit it.

868
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,900
- Lucky!

869
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,733
- Beyond lucky.

870
00:33:50,733 --> 00:33:52,040
- I don't wanna hear about you

871
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,260
with bad beats anymore, ever again.

872
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,100
- Walker Buehler, think about this,

873
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:00,570
an eight start stretch, an
ERA of 1.64, eight starts,

874
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:01,403
then got touched up the last one.

875
00:34:01,403 --> 00:34:03,770
That was at Coors Field,
let's throw that out.

876
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:05,957
Throw out Coors Field.
- Throw it out.

877
00:34:05,957 --> 00:34:08,389
- And the Dodgers are hot,
amazing health record.

878
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:10,037
- Yeah, thanks to five
straight walks with two outs.

879
00:34:10,037 --> 00:34:11,147
- Well, we're gonna need
to cover a run and a half.

880
00:34:11,147 --> 00:34:12,307
- Which has never been done before.

881
00:34:12,307 --> 00:34:14,816
- We're gonna hope to not to
get to the bottom of the ninth.

882
00:34:14,816 --> 00:34:16,324
We need a little breathing room.

883
00:34:16,324 --> 00:34:17,157
- You need a homer then.

884
00:34:17,157 --> 00:34:19,030
- But I don't think that
Buehler's gonna give up much.

885
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:22,010
I think this one gets away
from the D-backs and who knows.

886
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:23,173
Locker room demoralized after that?

887
00:34:23,173 --> 00:34:25,563
- All right.
- I'm hoping certainly shaky.

888
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,100
I'll lay the 1 1/2 minus 120.

889
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,690
I couldn't find any obscene money lines

890
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,835
to parlay with the
Dodgers, straight up, so.

891
00:34:31,835 --> 00:34:33,160
All right, we'll just
lay the run and a half

892
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,170
and try to stay hot this week.

893
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:38,100
Steve's laying the $1.38, as well.

894
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,500
All of us are playing to
our home teams, I love it.

895
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,700
Joe's plus money with the Giants,

896
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,510
and the Grizzlies for Preston,
out there laying tuna.

897
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:47,440
A lot of scouting for Preston, I love it.

898
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,090
- [Steve] I know, see him Monday.

899
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:52,810
- Gold Cup Semi-finals tonight,

900
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:56,370
men's soccer for the Americans
as they face Jamaica.

901
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:59,690
Remember they met last
Gold Cup Final in 2017,

902
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:01,270
two, one victory for the Americans.

903
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:05,830
Three way betting, U.S.
is 190, minus $1.90 to win

904
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:10,360
in regulation, in the draw,
plus 275 and Jamaica obviously,

905
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,330
a huge underdog with the over/under

906
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:15,893
at 2 1/2 and the under is minus $1.90.

907
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:19,730
For more, let's go out to
Nashville, ahead of tonight's game

908
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:23,690
and bring in ESPN FC
reporter, Jeff Carlisle.

909
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:25,400
Jeff, appreciate the taking the time.

910
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,310
U.S. favorite, as you very well know,

911
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:30,500
but let's go back about a
month ago where they lost

912
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,470
a friendly to Jamaica, one-nil.

913
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:35,810
How does the team tonight compare

914
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:37,963
to the one that lost that game?

915
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,470
- Well, it's gonna be
a very different team

916
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:44,320
that takes the field for
the Unites States tonight.

917
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,410
I count at least seven different players,

918
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:49,390
will be in the starting
lineup, possibly eight,

919
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:51,000
and those are key players, as well,

920
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,660
key attacking players
when you're talking about

921
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:55,610
Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie.

922
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:58,500
The Ford is either gonna be
Gyasi Zardes or Jozy Altidore.

923
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,010
None of those players play in that game.

924
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:03,210
Then you've got the guy
providing the shield

925
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:04,880
in front of the defense, Michael Bradley.

926
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,470
He's gonna be a key player
for the U.S. tonight.

927
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:10,360
He's gonna have to play
very well, be very mobile,

928
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:14,290
and so obviously, it's gonna
be a very different team

929
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:15,410
for the U.S. that takes the field.

930
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:18,780
Contrast that with Jamaica,
I counted seven players

931
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:21,200
that took the field in the
quarter final against Panama,

932
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,530
that were also on the field
that night in Washington, D.C.

933
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:25,070
when they played that
friendly against the U.S.

934
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:27,480
So, Jamaica's gonna have a few new faces,

935
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,630
the U.S. is gonna have a lot of new faces.

936
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:32,660
- All right, and the over/under's 2 1/2?

937
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,210
How much scoring do you expect?

938
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,270
- I don't expect a whole
lot of scoring tonight.

939
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:40,150
Jamaica has only conceded two goals

940
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,780
in the entire tournament.

941
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,630
The United States has kept a clean sheet

942
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,940
in every one of their Gold Cup games.

943
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,390
Their defense has been very stout,

944
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:50,100
that the back line has
been very consistent.

945
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:53,200
They've been tested, I mean,
Curacao, in the quarter finals

946
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,720
was definitely a team that
tested the U.S. with possession.

947
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,980
They had some good chances, as well,

948
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,630
and Zack Steffen in goal
has been very, very good.

949
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:03,140
So, on the other hand,
you've got Andre Blake,

950
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:06,080
who's a goal keeper that MLS
fans are very familiar with.

951
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,900
He plays for the Philadelphia Union.

952
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,780
He's also been very good and
came up big a couple of times

953
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,420
in the quarter final win over Panama.

954
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,840
So, I don't expect a whole
lot of scoring tonight.

955
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,670
I expect it to be a very tight semifinal

956
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:19,040
like we saw last night
with Mexico and Haiti.

957
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,350
So again, 2 1/2 goals
seems like a lot to me,

958
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:25,150
so I expect it to be a
one-nil affair, for sure.

959
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,293
- In favor of who?

960
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:30,780
- The United States, I would
agree that the United States

961
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,060
are slight favorites, but again,

962
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,470
Jamaica's played them very tough

963
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:35,450
and Jamaica's gone deep

964
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:39,450
in this tournament,
the last two additions.

965
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:40,970
They've made the final two times,

966
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:42,780
so when it comes to the Gold Cup,

967
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,770
Jamaica's a very difficult
team to break down, so.

968
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:47,090
But I look at the, I see the
U.S. getting through tonight.

969
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:47,923
- All right, sounds good.

970
00:37:47,923 --> 00:37:50,390
That's ESPN FC reporter, Jeff Carlisle,

971
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:52,490
joining us from Nashville,
ahead of tonight's

972
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:54,373
Gold Cup semifinal, thank you, Jeff.

973
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:56,710
- You're welcome.

974

- [Doug] And we're continuing to cover

975

a wide range of sports.

976
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,620
Coming up next, the number
one golfer in the world,

977
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:06,930
Brooks Koepka, is your
favorite at the 3M Open

978
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:10,370
and we'll tell you why
he's not the best bet.

979
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:13,700
Plus, Joey Chestnut, a heavy favorite

980
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:17,700
at the Hot Dog Eating Contest
but our expert will tell you

981
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:21,770
why weather could be a big
factor in the over/under

982
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:25,138
of hotdogs eating, that's next.

983
00:38:25,138 --> 00:38:27,721
(upbeat music)

984
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:31,150
- My insurance rates are
probably gonna double.

985

988
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,703
- Smart kid.
- Indeed.

- I've been there.

1032
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:37,650
I had a TV service with
hardly any sports in 4K,

1033
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:39,920
couldn't see any of the quality details.

get the most live sports in 4K.

1043
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:01,160
we know there are a lot of questions.

1044
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,570
- What's the mileage?
- How many previous owners?

1045
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:05,470
- Does the dealer have good reviews?

1046
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:07,380
- Does it include a navigation system?

1047
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,320
- [Announcer] We all know
the most important question

1048
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,370
is always--
- Am I getting a good deal?

1049
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:12,640
- Am I getting a good deal?

1050

1057
00:41:31,677 --> 00:41:33,940
and the best part is the
dog we get to feature.

1058
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:37,890
This is Baxter, who is a
service dog here at ESPN,

1059
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:41,200
works with our audio engineer, Tyler.

1060
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,860
Baxter, as you can see,
certainly in charge

1061
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,440
and he's now responsible for hitting

1062
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,330
the bleep button whenever
I lose a bet on set.

1063
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:52,100
So Baxter is profiled as we take a look

1064
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,310
at the biggest underdogs of the night

1065
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:56,180
and the biggest one is
actually a home team.

1066
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,080
The Blue Jays, in Toronto,

1067
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,100
facing Chris Sale and the Red Sox.

1068
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:03,837
D-backs above 200 on the comeback face,

1069
00:42:03,837 --> 00:42:06,820
and the Dodgers and Walker
Buehler, as I noted earlier,

1070
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:09,190
and the Marlins did close around plus 240

1071
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:13,300
against the Mets, but first
pitch already underway at 6:05.

1072
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,410
Joe Fortenbaugh, back with me.

1073
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:18,173
What's your Diamond Dog tonight, Joe?

1074
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:21,940
- All right, Doug, limited options tonight

1075
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,670
and there is no way I wanna get

1076
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:25,470
in front of the Walker Buehler train.

1077
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:27,870
So we're gonna fade Chris
Sale and the Red Sox.

1078
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:29,760
Give me Toronto plus 240.

1079
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,630
Chris Sale broke from the gate

1080
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:33,380
in sluggish fashion this season.

1081
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:36,160
A lot of people wondering what went wrong,

1082
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,400
settled down and was outstanding.

1083
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,310
Now, as of late, a bit iffy,

1084
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:42,090
not terrible, but a bit iffy.

1085
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:44,420
Last restarts, he's
given up 10 earned runs

1086
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,280
over 17 innings pitched.

1087
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,010
Again, not terrible, but
maybe there's something there

1088
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:51,560
we can take advantage
of, in this situation.

1089
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,210
One of those starts was at Fenway

1090
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:55,410
against Toronto, gave up a few runs,

1091
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:57,730
didn't exactly work
that deep into the game.

1092
00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:00,360
So this may be a spot where
you can take advantage

1093
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,880
of Chris Sale, who by the way,

1094
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:05,580
this is the worst hard hit
percentage of his entire career

1095
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:08,600
and his fastball's down
about a full mile an hour,

1096
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,340
over his results from last
season, so not the guy

1097
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:14,130
we saw last season, still
a very good pitcher.

1098
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:17,330
Boston has lost five of
eight, so this could be a nice

1099
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:20,410
little opportunity here to
back the dog at plus 240.

1100
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:21,620
- Yeah, I can't fault you there,

1101
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:24,010
given the price there on the dog.

1102
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:26,581
I'm gonna go with The Royals plus 145,

1103
00:43:26,581 --> 00:43:28,800
a little bit of a force, we
usually, has to go higher.

1104
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,770
In two starts since returning from injury,

1105
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:34,390
Mike Clevinger has allowed 12 runs.

1106
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:35,810
It sure looks like he returned

1107
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:37,710
too quickly from that back injury.

1108
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:38,750
Something just doesn't seem right,

1109
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:42,910
so I'll take the Royals at
home, plus the juice there.

1110
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:45,950
And by the way, if you wanna
send in pics of your dog,

1111
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:47,920
we will profile them every
time we do this segment,

1112
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,070
which isn't necessarily every
day, just tweet me @DougESPN.

1113
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:53,760
Joe will be back momentarily,
but one final look

1114
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,463
at Baxter, in charge, how awesome!

1115
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,120
PGA Tour, heading to Minnesota

1116
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:06,310
for the inaugural 3M
Open at TPC Twin Cities.

1117
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:09,420
No surprise, Brooks Koepka,
your favorite at eight to one.

1118
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:12,110
The only player with single digit odds.

1119
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:13,570
That's followed by Jason Day

1120
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:16,600
and Hideki Matsuyama, 11 to one a piece,

1121
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,920
Bryson DeChambeau, at 15 to one.

1122
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:23,920
Not posted here is lefty,
Phil Mickelson at 40 to one.

1123
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:26,830
Let's welcome back Anita Marks here,

1124
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:29,040
to talk a little golf,
given it is a Wednesday.

1125
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,700
She appears here on the
show every Wednesday.

1126
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:35,930
Of the favorites, Anita, which
one grabs your attention?

1127
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:39,670
- I'm going with Hideki, quick
note here, 27 water hazards,

1128
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:43,630
74 bunkers, that's what these
guys are gonna be facing.

1129
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:47,500
And Hideki has been coming
in red hot this season.

1130
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:50,580
This is a guy who has
not missed a cut, Doug,

1131
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:52,750
not one all season long.

1132
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:55,470
He's in great form, he's
red hot with his irons

1133
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:58,100
and each and every week,
we talk about the analytics

1134
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,310
that's going to play well on this course.

1135
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:03,670
Birdie average, he ranks 10th on tour,

1136
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:07,260
par five scoring, he ranks 25th and also,

1137
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:11,070
strokes gained, tee-to-green,
he ranks fourth on tour,

1138
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:13,780
so he's up there, top 25 in this category.

1139
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:15,330
He's gonna do exceptionally well.

1140
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:17,699
I like him, I'm putting some
hard earned money on him.

1141
00:45:17,699 --> 00:45:18,610
- Yeah, you liked him last week,

1142
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:21,110
did well, T-13, finished up there.

1143
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:24,020
What's another golfer
that you think kinda grabs

1144
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:25,700
your attention, in terms of value?

1145
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:28,240
- Let's go to Patrick Reed,
and he's coming in tied

1146
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,770
for fifth last week, so he's coming in hot

1147
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:33,100
and he's coming in with
a lot of confidence,

1148
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:35,270
and when you look at what
he's been able to do,

1149
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:37,000
the history in Minnesota.

1150
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,500
Let's go back to the 2016 Ryder
Cup where he got that name,

1151
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:44,330
Captain America, because
he took worry to the limit.

1152
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:46,950
His putting is a lot better
and each and every week,

1153
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:48,180
we like to talk about the grass.

1154
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:52,040
It's bent grass this week,
so the greens aren't gonna be

1155
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,550
as difficult as some
of these guys have seen

1156
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:57,440
in previous weeks, so I like Patrick Reed.

1157
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,940
- All right, sounds good,
can't let you get out of here

1158
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:02,820
without a DFS lineup,
advice, fire away here.

1159
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:05,550
- You got it, as always, the two guys

1160
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:07,710
that I first talk about,
my long, my short odds.

1161
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:09,430
I like to play them in DFS, as well.

1162
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:11,710
So, I'm going with Hideki and Patrick.

1163
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:14,150
Who am I gonna round it
out with, DeChambeau,

1164
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:17,330
fifth in birdie average
and par five scoring.

1165
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:19,050
His putting is finally coming back

1166
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:21,910
and he does extremely well
with generous fairways

1167
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:24,210
and that's what he's gonna
see, starting tomorrow.

1168
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:27,790
Niemann, back to back top fives, why?

1169
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:32,140
He has a new putting practice
that he's been practicing with

1170
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:33,490
and it's really been helping him.

1171
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:37,650
Also, 31st strokes gained tee-to-green.

1172
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:42,650
Homa, this is another guy who
just makes every cut 48th,

1173
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:46,550
par five scoring and here's
the thing, three par fives,

1174
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:51,090
593 yards, 596 yards,
there's some long par fives.

1175
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:53,530
And Redman is coming in red hot as well,

1176
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:57,040
second last week with 19
under, on the tournament.

1177
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,220
This is his third PGA start
and this very well could be,

1178
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:02,960
if he wins, this very well could
be the fourth straight week

1179
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,930
on the PGA Tour that we have these really

1180
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:09,900
surprising great winners,
so I'm always about that.

1181
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:12,470
I love the underdog,
I love the unexpected,

1182
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:15,140
so I'm really, really,
really cheering for Redman.

1183
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:15,973
- All right, sounds good.

1184
00:47:15,973 --> 00:47:18,630
Anita, thanks for the
insight, enjoy your holiday,

1185
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:21,140
and you'll be back obviously,
on the show, on Friday.

1186
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:23,390
- Yes, I'll be in for you, Doug,

1187
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:24,950
so hopefully, you have a great weekend.

1188
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:26,650
- [Doug] Oh, I will, hit the road.

1189
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:30,240
And straight ahead on this show though,

1190
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,760
the greatest emcee in sports, George Shea,

1191
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,500
will break down tomorrow's
Hot Dog Eating Contest.

1192
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:38,890
- And to me, that's the
greatest honor of this sport,

1193
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:41,280
is to be able to introduce
Joey Chestnut because to me,

1194
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,410
he is America itself,
to me, he is freedom,

1195
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:47,476
he is the essence of who we are.

1196
00:47:47,476 --> 00:47:50,059
(upbeat music)

1197
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:55,386
(dogs barking)

1198
00:47:57,222 --> 00:48:00,040
- What about him?
♪ I know ♪

1199
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:04,509

00:48:11,656 --> 00:48:12,489
- [Woman] Come on!

1204
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:14,420
- [Advertiser] This summer,

1206
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:17,420
today for exceptional offers.

1207
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:19,950
Lease the GLC 300 SUV
for just $419 a month

1208
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:22,810
through Mercedes-Benz
Summer Event, going on now.

1209
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:24,910
- [Announcer] You wanna stay
cool when you're feeling hot

1210
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:28,070
but running your air
conditioner all day costs a lot.

1211
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:30,880
Fans are bulky and just
blow hot air in your face.

1212
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,640
There has to be a better
way to cool down your place.

1213
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:36,660
Introducing Arctic Air,
the personal space cooler

1214
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:39,910
that turns hot spaces into
cool refreshing places

1215
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:42,210
for just pennies a day,
whether you wanna cool off

1216
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:45,540
in a hot kitchen or stay
nice and comfy, watching TV,

1217
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:48,670
Arctic Air let's you create
your own personal comfort zone.

1218
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:50,620
Just add water and press the button.

1219
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:53,000
Then relax and enjoy the cooling breeze.

1220
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,170
Look, portable air conditioners
take up so much space

1221
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:58,410
and have to vent out a
window but Arctic Air

1222
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:00,220
is self contained and light weight.

1223
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:03,320
So now, you can have
cool clean air anywhere.

1224
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:07,190
Even the intense heat of this
blow dryer reads at 96 degrees

1225
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:10,050
but with Arctic Air,
it's a comfortable 72.

1226
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:12,080
The secret is hydro-chill technology

1227
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:14,500
that uses an evaporative
air cooling filter

1228
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,710
that pulls in hot air and instantly

1229
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:19,010
transforms it into cool refreshing air,

1230
00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:20,910
with three adjustable speed settings,

1231
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:23,710
you have precise control
and the whisper quiet fan

1232
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:27,240
circulates the air up to eight
hours on just one filling.

1233
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,250
And there's even a soothing night light.

1234
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:31,200
What a great way to cool off your bedroom

1235
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,440
without air conditioning your entire home.

1236
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,130
Arctic Air also purifies
and humidifies your air,

1237
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:38,110
so it's better for you and your family.

1238
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:40,630
Plus, you can even beat the heat outdoors

1239
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:43,980
and enjoy a cool refreshing
breeze, even on the hottest day.

1240
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:47,810

- [Doug] The championship is
set for the Women's World Cup.

1277
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:20,770
Obviously, the Americans advanced today.

1278
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:24,780
Netherlands gets a go in
the 99th minute, one-nil.

1279
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:27,470
So that is your showdown, and Caesars,

1280
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:30,580
just posting these odds, the Americans

1281
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:35,580
minus 475 to hoist the trophy.

1282
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,900
Now, three way betting will be out later,

1283
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:40,970
but just to win, no matter when it occurs.

1284
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:43,830
U.S., nearly a five to one favorite

1285
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:47,220
over Netherlands, so, that is Sunday.

1286
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,640
Let's get ready for tomorrow.

1287
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:53,090
It is a staple on our Independence Day,

1288
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:55,993
the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest.

1289
00:51:57,950 --> 00:52:01,710
- And here is George Shea.
- Through meditation,

1290
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:05,820
he learned that his spirit
animal is a bologna sandwich.

1291
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:08,040
He has the body of Adonis,

1292
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,620
but the eating habits

1293
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:10,890
of Homer Simpson.
- Doh!

1294
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:14,130
- He is not, as they say, book smart.

1295
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:17,360
In fact, if you ask him to name a country

1296
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,657
in Central America, he will say,

1297
00:52:19,657 --> 00:52:20,810
"Kansas?"
(timer buzzing)

1298
00:52:20,810 --> 00:52:24,670
The difficulty in his
marriage began after he named

1299
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:27,600
his children Mild, Medium, and Hot.

1300
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:32,600
His good cholesterol is low,
his bad cholesterol is high,

1301
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:36,330
and his BMI is borderline presidential.

1302
00:52:36,330 --> 00:52:41,290
When we are young, we drink
our coffee with milk and sugar

1303
00:52:41,290 --> 00:52:44,420
and as we age, we drink it with milk only.

1304
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:49,010
Then we drink it black, then
we drink it decaf, then we die.

1305
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:51,100
Our next eatery is at decaf.

1306
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:55,700
It is an honor to all those now living,

1307
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:57,730
to behold this man.

1308
00:52:57,730 --> 00:53:01,880
He is the fortress at
the center of our nation.

1309
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:05,933
Of one nation, under God!

1310
00:53:07,131 --> 00:53:12,131
Indivisible, he is
champion, Joey Chestnut!

1311
00:53:14,952 --> 00:53:18,369
("Star Spangled Banner")

1312
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:23,370
- We're now pleased to
welcome in the voice

1313
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:25,680
and the biggest
personality of the July 4th

1314
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,050
Hot Dog Eating Contest, George Shea.

1315
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:30,260
George, thanks so much
for taking the time.

1316
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:31,480
- Oh, thank you for having me.

1317
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:32,700
- All right, let's talk about it.

1318
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:36,440
Look, you've been with this
event for three decades.

1319
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:40,050
You are an expert of all
experts, so let's get into it.

1320
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:43,220
Joey Chestnut, he is synonymous here,

1321
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,580
a record 11 Mustard Belts.

1322
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:48,233
Is there any chance he
does not win this event?

1323
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:51,690
- Oh, I think there's absolutely
a chance he doesn't win,

1324
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:54,830
but I think the odds
would be extremely low.

1325
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:57,250
Not only is he dominant in the sport,

1326
00:53:57,250 --> 00:54:00,310
74 hot dogs and buns
last year, in 10 minutes,

1327
00:54:00,310 --> 00:54:02,640
but on top of that, I saw him today.

1328
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:07,510
He looks absolutely in top
form, he's very trim, very fit.

1329
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:10,030
He seems very healthy,
and rested, and confident,

1330
00:54:10,030 --> 00:54:12,740
so I think he's gonna be coming in strong.

1331
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:14,940
But at any time, he could be beaten

1332
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:17,310
and there are a couple guys, Geoff Esper

1333
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:19,820
and Matt Stonie, who could take him down.

1334
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:23,050
- Talk more about those two
contenders, if you will.

1335
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:25,080
What makes them, what's the path

1336
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:28,280
to their success and
beating Joey Chestnut?

1337
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:30,610
- Well, both of them
have enormous capacity

1338
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:33,900
and Geoffrey Esper actually,
has beaten Joey Chestnut,

1339
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:37,990
if I'm correct, two times
in the last three weeks.

1340
00:54:37,990 --> 00:54:40,470
He got him in Hostess Donettes

1341
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:43,790
and he got him in chicken
wings, he's a monster.

1342
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:48,530
He's a relative rookie, second,
third year on the circuit.

1343
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:50,890
I think he gets a little
bit of the jitters

1344
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:53,370
going into the big contest
on the Fourth of July.

1345
00:54:53,370 --> 00:54:56,050
He ate 51 hot dogs to qualify.

1346
00:54:56,050 --> 00:54:59,010
Keep in mind, the qualifying
hot dogs are harder to eat,

1347
00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:03,150
so you really have to think
of him, up at a 60 mark or so.

1348
00:55:03,150 --> 00:55:07,540
Then there's also Matt Stonie,
he's really an internet star

1349
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:10,410
now, a YouTube star, eight
million followers on YouTube.

1350
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:13,620
He does a bunch of
challenges, enormous capacity,

1351
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:16,430
enormous capacity, but
often people have said,

1352
00:55:16,430 --> 00:55:18,560
he doesn't prepare for
the contest and get ready.

1353
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:21,400
There's a rumor our there,
and I can't vouch for it,

1354
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:23,370
but he's really gunning for Joey this year

1355
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:24,980
and he could bring some heat.

1356
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:28,600
- Okay, a couple of things
to digest, forgive the pun.

1357
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:32,340
Qualifying hot dogs are
harder to eat, why is that?

1358
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:34,550
- Well, if you think of
it, you're at Nathan's,

1359
00:55:34,550 --> 00:55:37,130
you're at the, sort of
the mecca of hot dogs

1360
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:40,900
and they're cooked, perfectly
cooked on the griddle.

1361
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:43,450
And they're cooked to
come off of the griddle

1362
00:55:43,450 --> 00:55:45,440
about 10 or 15 minutes
prior to the contest.

1363
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,480
So they're the perfect
temperature, they're warm,

1364
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:49,160
they're not cold, they're not hot.

1365
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:50,810
When you're out on the circuit,

1366
00:55:50,810 --> 00:55:54,220
you might be at a festival,
you might be at a ballpark,

1367
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:56,870
but bringing the hot dogs in, in warmers.

1368
00:55:56,870 --> 00:56:00,020
They've been cooked a half
an hour, an hour before.

1369
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:01,817
Sometimes they're not fully griddled.

1370
00:56:01,817 --> 00:56:04,570
They're just cooked or they're steamed

1371
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:07,590
but they're not grilled as
they would be at Coney Island,

1372
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:10,100
and as a result, they're
more difficult to eat

1373
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:13,480
or it takes longer to eat those dogs.

1374
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,780
- All right, fascinating
stuff on that fact.

1375
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:16,880
As you mentioned earlier,

1376
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:19,720
Chestnut ate 74 hot dogs last year.

1377
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:21,220
Do you see him hitting that mark

1378
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:23,070
or going past it this year, as well?

1379
00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:26,480
- Well you know, I absolutely
think he'll be around there.

1380
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,380
There have been times
when things drop off,

1381
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:30,750
it could be the temperature of the day,

1382
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:32,870
it could be literally, the humidity.

1383
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:36,060
Actually, when you have
a very, very dry day,

1384
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:37,420
it can dry out the buns.

1385
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:39,810
So even if they're only out
there for five or 10 minutes,

1386
00:56:39,810 --> 00:56:41,590
they have a different consistency.

1387
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:44,120
The hot dogs can tighten
up more in the sun.

1388
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,690
So the temperature could play a role.

1389
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:47,070
- So, let's talk about the women's side.

1390
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:51,190
Micki Sudo going for a
sixth straight Mustard Belt.

1391
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:52,900
What are the chances in your eyes,

1392
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:55,710
she does not make it six straight?

1393
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:58,930
- I think they're low, the
chances that she does not win,

1394
00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:01,450
but there could be more variability

1395
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:02,900
in her performance on that.

1396
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:06,100
So I do think it's
possible that Juliet Lee

1397
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:09,320
or Michelle Lesco could
make a real run at her.

1398
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:10,560
- The whole spectacle is awesome.

1399
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,960
I'm looking forward to
watching it on July 4th.

1400
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:15,290
And George, it was an honor to
have you here and I'm looking

1401
00:57:15,290 --> 00:57:17,400
forward to watching your
performance, as well.

1402
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:18,593
Thank you for taking the time.

1403
00:57:18,593 --> 00:57:21,103
- Thank you, thank you for having me.

1404
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:24,510
- And on that note, we go to Prop Culture

1405
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:25,550
to wrap up the show.

1406
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:28,400
Joe Fortenbaugh joins
me now and Joe, look,

1407
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,900
total of hot dogs on the men's division,

1408
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:34,030
73 1/2 and this is interesting,

1409
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:37,920
I love what emcee George Shea
just said about Matt Stonie,

1410
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,470
who he's hearing grumblings,
that he's going to really

1411
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:44,430
bring it this year in his,
of course, enormous capacity.

1412
00:57:44,430 --> 00:57:46,530
I've been tracking this
stuff for a long time,

1413
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:47,980
when I worked in Las Vegas.

1414
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:51,201
I got to do a live shot,
downtown with the one and only,

1415
00:57:51,201 --> 00:57:54,800
Joey Chestnut, and the
one and only, Kobayashi.

1416
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:58,120
They were talking trash to
one another, a lot of fun.

1417
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:03,120
I'm no expert but I'm saying
under 73 1/2, if I had to, Joe.

1418
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:07,670
- Doug, let me start by congratulating you

1419
00:58:07,670 --> 00:58:09,070
on a tremendous interview,

1420
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:12,810
Shades of David Frost and
Richard Nixon, no doubt.

1421
00:58:12,810 --> 00:58:16,580
Now, I'm going over 73 1/2 hot dogs

1422
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:18,360
and I got Joey Chestnut
winning this thing.

1423
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:20,390
Doug, Joey Chestnut lives here

1424
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:22,900
in the Bay Area, where I live.

1425
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:27,180
The land of kale, the land
of avocado toast, soda taxes.

1426
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:29,230
If you even think about
having a cheeseburger,

1427
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:32,050
they wanna cast you out
into the Pacific Ocean.

1428
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:35,220
Beautiful area, no doubt,
but they are not too fond

1429
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:39,760
of noshing 73 1/2 hot dogs in 10 minutes.

1430
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,570
That's not how people
do things here and yet,

1431
00:58:41,570 --> 00:58:43,810
Joey Chestnut rises every day in the face

1432
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:46,670
of that adversity and he
takes on his detractors.

1433
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:48,370
Let's go back to 2015,

1434
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:51,060
when he lost to Matt Stonie, 62 to 60.

1435
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:54,030
Came back the next year to
set a record with 70 hot dogs,

1436
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:55,140
came back the following year

1437
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:57,520
to set a record with 72 hot dogs,

1438
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:58,830
and then came back last year

1439
00:58:58,830 --> 00:59:01,230
to set another record with 74 hot dogs.

1440
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:04,280
This guy is not worried
about his competition.

1441
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:07,159
He's worried about history and
he has stated that his goal

1442
00:59:07,159 --> 00:59:10,670
is to knock down 80 hot
dogs in a single sitting.

1443
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:12,070
Doug, I say to you,

1444
00:59:12,070 --> 00:59:15,274
God bless Joey Chestnut,
God bless America.

1445
00:59:15,274 --> 00:59:17,520
- (chuckles) And weather
on your side, Joe,

1446
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:20,880
because it's gonna be a
humid day and George Shea

1447
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:24,280
was just saying that, that
lends itself to the over,

1448
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:26,520
because the buns won't dry out,

1449
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:28,110
but then I didn't think of asking him,

1450
00:59:28,110 --> 00:59:30,270
a lot of the competitors
dip the buns in the water,

1451
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:32,080
so I'm a little confused.

1452
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:35,630
I have certain thresholds for expertise

1453
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:38,330
on the Hot Dog Eating
Contest but I do know this,

1454
00:59:38,330 --> 00:59:42,640
I will be watching and this
isn't like those other sports,

1455
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,520
like football and basketball,

1456
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,900
where you only have to
watch the last few minutes.

1457
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:48,500
You have to watch the beginning

1458
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:51,400
because of George Shea
and all the introductions

1459
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,900
and the pomp and circumstance, as well.

1460
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:54,520
So, Joe, we appreciate it.

1461
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:57,170
I know who you're rooting
for here, your home town guy,

1462
00:59:57,170 --> 00:59:59,430
and more importantly, happy Fourth of July

1463
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:01,823
and enjoy your holiday, my friend.

1464
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:06,640
And recapping our Best
Bets, Preston in Vegas,

1465
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,730
Summer League, Grizzlies, minus 2 1/2.

1466
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:11,550
Joe's on the underdog Giants, plus $1.20.

1467
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:14,330
Stanford Steve laying
the $1.38 with the Yanks,

1468
01:00:14,330 --> 01:00:16,600
trying to bounce back in the Subway Series

1469
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:19,553
and I'll lay the run and a
half with the red hot Dodgers.
