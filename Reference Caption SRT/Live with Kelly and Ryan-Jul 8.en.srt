- Stop.

28
00:01:28,327 --> 00:01:31,494
- [Both] We haven't done anything yet.

29
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:33,216
- Great minds think.

30
00:01:33,216 --> 00:01:35,750
We've been waiting two weeks to say that.

31
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,070
- Together at the same time.

32
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,410
Monday, July 8, 2019, good morning.

33
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:40,417
- Hi, good morning.

34
00:01:40,417 --> 00:01:41,250
- You look...

35
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,270
- I'm still jet-lagged.

36
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,150
I've been up
- You look great.

37
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,043
- Since three o'clock this morning.

38
00:01:45,043 --> 00:01:45,876
How about you?

39
00:01:45,876 --> 00:01:46,709
- Oh, well, we're almost done.

40
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:47,737
- Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

41
00:01:47,737 --> 00:01:49,200
- In just than, less than an hour.

42
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,420
- Very, very jet-lagged.

43
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,220
It's funny, the older you get

44
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,540
the harder it is to
flip over, I feel like.

45
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,373
You know what I mean?

46
00:01:57,373 --> 00:01:59,420
- Yeah, like when I go back
and forth, east to west.

47
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,060
When I do that every week,

48
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,270
when I was younger, it was easier.

49
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,750
Now, it's painful.
- Painful.

50
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,244
- But you were on a
European jet lag, right?

51
00:02:05,244 --> 00:02:08,050
- Yes, yes, I'm on European jet lag.

52
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,547
- So it's dinner time.

53
00:02:09,547 --> 00:02:11,063
- I'm starving.

54
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,120
I wanna eat pasta right now.

55
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,350
- Oh my gosh, how was it?

56
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,183
- It was great.

57
00:02:16,183 --> 00:02:18,750
Let me, can I show you, can
I bore you with some photos?

58
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,372
You know how I love to show you my--

59
00:02:20,372 --> 00:02:21,883
(audience cheers)
Yeah, you're welcome.

60
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:29,980
Let me just say that we
went home to the house

61
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:34,560
where my husband grew up
as a small child, okay?

62
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,310
So we went to the house.

63
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,460
This was not his birthplace house.

64
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,970
This is where they moved
when he was a small kid.

65
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,100
I don't know how old he is in this photo.

66
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,770
I'm gonna say like four or five years old.

67
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,330
This is where they moved.

68
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,020
This tiny little beach
town in southern Italy.

69
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:57,653
This one over here is my
adorable husband, right there.

70
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,200
That's his brother, Mike

71
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,690
and that's my sister-in-law, Adriana.

72
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,800
There's my mother-in-law right there.

73
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,040
Sorry about my fingernails.

74
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,450
They look ridiculous, but these
were vacation fingernails.

75
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:13,540
And that's my grandfather-in-law,
who has passed away,

76
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,373
may he rest in peace.

77
00:03:14,373 --> 00:03:15,330
- What a beautiful picture.

78
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:20,330
- So we recreated it with our group,

79
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,270
so there we are in front of the house.

80
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,700
They were on the inside of the fence here.

81
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,028
We're on the outside of the fence.

82
00:03:29,028 --> 00:03:31,030
(audience and Ryan laugh)

83
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,840
- We rang the bell and nobody was home.

84
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,250
Nobody was home but there we are.

85
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,930
It was just very emotional to go back

86
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:43,660
and to have these photos
and to picture my--

87
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,257
- What was Mark's
reaction when he got back?

88
00:03:45,257 --> 00:03:48,740
- He was very emotional.

89
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,067
He goes, "It's exactly the same,

90
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:52,017
"except the trees have gotten bigger."

91
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:56,450
It's exactly as he remembered it.

92
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:59,580
We pulled up in a minivan,
as we (video blips)

93
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,840
and we...

94
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,320
everything is like a tiny little car,

95
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,850
so we looked like we were in a truck.

96
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,557
And when we pulled into
the street, he goes,

97
00:04:10,557 --> 00:04:12,787
"Everybody's going to
come out of the front door

98
00:04:12,787 --> 00:04:14,620
"or hang over the terraces."

99
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,060
And like clockwork, it was like..

100
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,299
- Oh, look at the tourists.

101
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,216
- Hmm, hmm.

102
00:04:20,437 --> 00:04:23,920
And it was just, we
started playing a game,

103
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,833
count the nonnas on the terrace.

104
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,480
I'm like, how many nonnas do you think

105
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,460
we're gonna see on the terrace?

106
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,250
The kids were like, "We'll see
12 nonnas on the terraces."

107
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,730
So anyway, I took some
pictures of my husband

108
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,930
because I love to
photograph him on vacation--

109
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,480
- He's shirtless.
(audience laughs)

110
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,730
- He is shirtless, yes.

111
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,350
There he is here.

112
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:45,579
Yep, mmm hmmm.
(audience catcalls)

113
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:49,525
You're welcome America and
Canada, you're welcome, yes.

114
00:04:49,525 --> 00:04:50,358
- It's depressing.

115
00:04:50,358 --> 00:04:51,490
- Plus, my kids, he's

116
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:54,000
by the way, I just want to
point out in this photo,

117
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,150
he's surrounded by my children,

118
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,480
who will no longer let
me post photos of them,

119
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,170
so there he is.

120
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,390
Here we are, we got a little lost,

121
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,230
he refused to ask for directions,

122
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,110
but he thought he could
just find it himself.

123
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,310
- It looks like an ad, doesn't it?

124
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,970
It looks like an ad for sun
- Isn't that great?

125
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:11,990
- It's like a Ray-Ban ad.

126
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,615
- Yeah, it's great.

127
00:05:13,615 --> 00:05:14,690
- I had no idea my picture's being taken.

128
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,870
- Here he is with his, there we are.

129
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:18,870
- See?
- Yep.

130
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,470
- There he is with my
doppleganger son of his,

131
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:22,310
like the two twins.

132
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,292
- They look like boys.

133
00:05:23,292 --> 00:05:24,393
- There they are the boys.
- Yeah.

134
00:05:24,393 --> 00:05:26,763
Here they are at a wall of bougainvillea.

135
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:31,157
Finally, I said to him,
"Hey, will you do me a favor,

136
00:05:31,157 --> 00:05:33,447
"because I'm gonna show some
of these pictures on the air,

137
00:05:33,447 --> 00:05:35,867
"will you take a picture of me,

138
00:05:35,867 --> 00:05:38,647
"because I just want to be able

139
00:05:38,647 --> 00:05:41,577
"to prove that I was on this trip."

140
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:45,263
And so he did, he took a picture of me.

141
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,812
I don't know if you can see it.

142
00:05:47,812 --> 00:05:50,830
(audience laughs)

143
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:51,973
That's me.

144
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,930
If you look past the flowers,

145
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,540
that's me floating on a pool float.

146
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,630
It's like a giant pillow.

147
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,520
They called it a ravioli.

148
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,050
I'm not kidding, they call
it the floating ravioli.

149
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,780
But that's the one picture he took of me.

150
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,490
There it is.

151
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,450
Then I just wanted to show you snakes.

152
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,373
There were also snakes on this trip.

153
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,423
They were free.

154
00:06:13,423 --> 00:06:15,350
You didn't even have to
pay extra for the snakes.

155
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:18,230
- You sent me a text,
you said one word, snakes

156
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,337
and I said oh okay.

157
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,654
- He was like, what
does that mean, snakes?

158
00:06:20,654 --> 00:06:22,010
There are snakes.
- What does that mean,

159
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:22,843
- everywhere?

160
00:06:22,843 --> 00:06:24,850
- I don't know why they keep finding me.

161
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,430
People were like, no,
there are no snakes here.

162
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,863
I go, I am photographing snakes.

163
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,200
- There's actually a
second photo of you here.

164
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,628
If you take a closer look,

165
00:06:32,628 --> 00:06:34,788
I think that's you in the
shadow there, isn't it?

166
00:06:34,788 --> 00:06:35,621
(audience laughs)
- Oh yeah that's me.

167
00:06:35,621 --> 00:06:36,621
- That's me.

168
00:06:39,681 --> 00:06:41,161
- Thank you.
- Good shot.

169
00:06:41,161 --> 00:06:41,994
- Thanks though.

170
00:06:41,994 --> 00:06:42,830
- [Man] Very muscular.

171
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,186
- Yeah, you look very
fit in that silhouette.

172
00:06:45,186 --> 00:06:47,050
- My shadows are very muscular.

173
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,410
- Your shadows look great.

174
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,550
- My shadows have a lot of curves.

175
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:53,300
- Mark didn't capture you,
but he captured your shadow.

176
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:57,085
- He did that, I captured my own shadow.

177
00:06:57,085 --> 00:06:58,600
Mark took a picture of plants.

178
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,879
- Plants with someone
on a floating ravioli.

179
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,637
- I accidentally drifted
by on a pool float.

180
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,970
How was your vacation?

181
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:07,803
- It was great.

182
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:08,860
- 'Cause you were gone a long time.

183
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,040
- I was gone a long time as well.

184
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,330
I had to go overseas
for a little convention

185
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,720
for the radio show, which was in Cannes.

186
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,670
Then I went back to L.A. for a day.

187
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:20,110
Then I went to Greece to
get some sun afterwards.

188
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,100
- Greece is the word.

189
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,550
- It's just beautiful,
the people are great,

190
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,860
the food is great, but during
all of this, something,

191
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,190
you know, because I've got this niece now,

192
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,590
every first is a big deal in the family

193
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:33,210
so my sister, she was so
nervous about traveling

194
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,891
with baby Flora for the
first time on the plane.

195
00:07:35,891 --> 00:07:37,819
So here they are.

196
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:41,448
I just wanna show you, this is
Jimmy and Meredith and Flora

197
00:07:41,448 --> 00:07:44,240
(audience coos)
on their first flight.

198
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,160
- Adorable.

199
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,000
- And she was so concerned
about how Flora was gonna do,

200
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,183
was she gonna manage,
was she gonna be a mess,

201
00:07:49,183 --> 00:07:51,470
was she gonna be screaming and crying.

202
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:54,320
Well looks like she enjoyed herself.

203
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,320
(audience laughs)

204
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,060
- I can't believe she is my size.

205
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:00,893
- She's our size.

206
00:08:00,893 --> 00:08:02,490
- She is our size.

207
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,291
That is the outfit I wore
on the show last week.

208
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:08,877
- I was gonna say. (laughs)

209
00:08:08,877 --> 00:08:10,470
One of the things I discovered,

210
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,830
because you know, I love to eat and snack,

211
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,663
especially when I'm on vacation.

212
00:08:13,663 --> 00:08:15,930
I took the clocks out of my room

213
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,640
so I didn't know what time it
was in the middle of the night

214
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,290
or what time it was in the morning,

215
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:21,460
so I slept 'til I woke up.

216
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,230
It's the greatest thing ever.

217
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,775
- You slept until I texted you.

218
00:08:24,775 --> 00:08:26,145
- Snakes.

219
00:08:26,145 --> 00:08:26,978
- Pictures of snakes.

220
00:08:26,978 --> 00:08:28,230
- Leave me alone.

221
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,410
But you know, you and Mark have

222
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,950
PB and Js all the time.

223
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:35,110
I had every day, every
day on vacation, a PBJB.

224
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:36,903
Have you had that?

225
00:08:36,903 --> 00:08:38,510
- What's a PBJB?

226
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:41,076
- Peanut butter, jelly and bacon.

227
00:08:41,076 --> 00:08:43,020
(audience exclaims)

228
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,393
You're welcome as well,
America and Canada.

229
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,270
I leave you with this treat today.

230
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:52,825
Make yourself a PBJB,
peanut butter jelly ba.

231
00:08:52,825 --> 00:08:54,693
You're shaking, are you cited?

232
00:08:54,693 --> 00:08:56,244
- I'm so cited about that.

233
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,670
- This is what you guys
should be making every night.

234
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,160
'Cause Mark loves to
eat these in bed, right?

235
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,510
- Oh my God, it's his favorite thing.

236
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,875
But you know what's so funny is?

237
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,860
We were in Corsica first

238
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,000
and then we went to Italy

239
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,650
and we did not have access.

240
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,490
I mean, I'm sure we could have conjured up

241
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,940
access to peanut butter and jelly,

242
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,150
but we like to eat local.

243
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,930
We like to eat what local people eat,

244
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,930
so we were having lots of
- Olive butter.

245
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,010
- Fresh food.

246
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,580
Fresh fish and fresh,
we had pasta every day

247
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,310
and it was homemade and we went to a farm

248
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:33,630
where they make the burrata
and it was incredible.

249
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,340
We did the whole thing.

250
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,700
And he, of course, because he was

251
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:42,440
without peanut butter
and jelly for two weeks,

252
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,170
lost five pounds.
(audience laughs)

253
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:46,150
- 'Cause he needed to.

254
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,970
- He lost five pounds.

255
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:48,803
- Yeah, you saw him in that shot.

256
00:09:48,803 --> 00:09:51,330
- Just skipping peanut butter and jelly.

257
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,190
It's so irritating.
(audience laughs)

258
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,310
- We'll start sneaking in,

259
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,430
no kidding, I know.

260
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:56,960
I mean, start sneaking the bacon in there.

261
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,830
He'll regain it.
- Just slide it right in.

262
00:09:58,830 --> 00:09:59,663
- Just slide it right in.

263
00:09:59,663 --> 00:10:00,496
He'll never notice.
- See if he notices.

264
00:10:00,496 --> 00:10:01,329
- He'll never notice.

265
00:10:01,329 --> 00:10:02,870
Lots of news over the last couple days.

266
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:06,130
These two earthquakes in
southern California, big deal.

267
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:06,963
Real serious.

268
00:10:06,963 --> 00:10:09,230
There was two back-to-back, basically

269
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:13,530
and the last one, 7.1, which
is eight times stronger

270
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,399
than the first one.
- Eleven times.

271
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,232
- Eleven times, stronger
than the first one, right?

272
00:10:15,232 --> 00:10:18,670
- That's so interesting, 'cause
I was watching that on CNN.

273
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,760
They were explaining it.
- The decimal, right?

274
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,597
- So you go, okay, so first one was 6.4,

275
00:10:25,406 --> 00:10:26,239
- The Richter.

276
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:29,290
- And then the 7.1, you
go, oh, it's not that much.

277
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:31,770
It doesn't seem like
that much big of a shift

278
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:32,770
and apparently--

279
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:33,603
- It's exponential.

280
00:10:33,603 --> 00:10:34,680
- It's exponential.

281
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,380
It's that times.

282
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,580
- Yeah, every decimal is
that full amount times.

283
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,413
- Times whatever.

284
00:10:41,413 --> 00:10:42,300
- So it is significant.

285
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,133
Have you been?

286
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:44,390
I've been in them before.

287
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,040
I was not there for the Northridge one,

288
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,280
I had not moved to L.A. yet.

289
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,113
- Oh, you're kidding.

290
00:10:48,113 --> 00:10:50,210
- But I have been there for smaller ones,

291
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:55,210
threes and fours and even those scare ya.

292
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:59,030
- My son was out in
California, my oldest son,

293
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,370
and he was in L.A. proper,

294
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:05,020
but he said they could
feel the earthquakes.

295
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,430
They felt them.

296
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:10,150
- You kinda, after you feel
one, you stop sleeping naked

297
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:13,120
because
(audience laughs)

298
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,310
you just never know when you're gonna

299
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:18,480
have to run into the door jamb, right?

300
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,313
- [Man] Shoes by the side of the bed.

301
00:11:19,313 --> 00:11:20,180
- Shoes by the side of the bed.

302
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,455
But here, it's safe to sleep naked.

303
00:11:22,455 --> 00:11:23,288
(audience laughs)

304
00:11:23,288 --> 00:11:25,940
- Well, it depends on
whose house you're in.

305
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,490
- Well generally, I
like to sleep in my own.

306
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,740
- I mean, don't sleep naked in my house,

307
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,470
'cause the kids will
walk in at any second.

308
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:34,210
They'll be, "Don't you
ever put clothes on?"

309
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,117
And I'm like, "Don't you knock?"

310
00:11:36,117 --> 00:11:38,910
(audience laughs)

311
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,450
Anyway, it's so interesting.

312
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,460
There's so much to talk about in sports.

313
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:47,576
I mean, the Women's Soccer

314
00:11:47,576 --> 00:11:50,409
(audience cheers)

315
00:11:55,834 --> 00:11:57,751
- Incredible, so great.

316
00:11:59,484 --> 00:12:02,170
- I, who don't watch, watched and I said,

317
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,940
I cannot believe I've been missing

318
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,550
this sport for so many years.

319
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,383
- It's incredible, right?

320
00:12:06,383 --> 00:12:07,216
- Yeah.

321
00:12:07,216 --> 00:12:09,660
You know, my husband and
my kids always watch soccer

322
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,050
and I just drifted in and out.

323
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,107
God, they are so, so good.

324
00:12:14,107 --> 00:12:16,035
- So good.
- So good.

325
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:19,613
- I was so just
unabashedly happy for them.

326
00:12:20,525 --> 00:12:21,358
- Well, they're gonna be celebrated.

327
00:12:21,358 --> 00:12:23,730
I think Wednesday there's a
big parade here in the city.

328
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,947
- Yes, that would be downtown.
(audience cheers)

329
00:12:25,947 --> 00:12:27,133
- Downtown, yeah.

330
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:32,660
Then, Alex, Alex Morgan, she's nominated

331
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,690
for Best Female Athlete at the ESPYs,

332
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,300
which also airs on Wednesday, right?

333
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,150
- [Man] Yeah.
- Incredible.

334
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,480
- On ABC, yeah.

335
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,313
- Fabulous.

336
00:12:39,313 --> 00:12:40,655
- So congratulations to that team.

337
00:12:40,655 --> 00:12:41,488
(audience cheers)

338
00:12:41,488 --> 00:12:43,340
If you haven't been watching,
you've been missing.

339
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,963
Did you watch any of the tennis?

340
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,340
Did you see Coco?

341
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,450
- I know, so I don't follow tennis,

342
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:52,280
but Mark keeps saying, oh my
God, you've gotta follow tennis

343
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:57,280
because there's this young
girl named Coco, is it Gauff?

344
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:01,130
Who is 15 years old and is really

345
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,463
on this winning streak at Wimbledon.

346
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,160
So I have a 16-year-old
son and my daughter,

347
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,790
who just turned 18, and--

348
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,630
- You just picturing
it, thinking about it.

349
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,210
- You picture them at 15.

350
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,460
Any 15-year-olds here, 15?

351
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,180
Hi, hi there.

352
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,560
So 15, give me the rundown.

353
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,653
What are you into?

354
00:13:22,595 --> 00:13:24,330
- [Girl] Backstreet Boys.

355
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,297
- Backstreet Boys?

356
00:13:25,297 --> 00:13:26,783
- You're into the Backstreet boys.

357
00:13:26,783 --> 00:13:30,600
- It's so funny, we were too as teenagers.

358
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,969
- Somebody down here was
yelling, what are you into?

359
00:13:32,969 --> 00:13:33,802
- [Girl] Dance.

360
00:13:33,802 --> 00:13:34,720
- You're into dance?
- Dance?

361
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,993
- Are you a competitive dancer?

362
00:13:38,344 --> 00:13:39,177
- No.

363
00:13:39,177 --> 00:13:40,059
- Don't clam up now.

364
00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:42,197
(audience laughs)
This is your big moment.

365
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:44,612
- [Girl] We love to dance.

366
00:13:44,612 --> 00:13:47,099
We also love musical theater
and acting and singing.

367
00:13:47,099 --> 00:13:47,970
- [Ryan] Musical theater,
acting and singing.

368
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,240
- Okay, all right.

369
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,377
So, I want you to picture that you're--

370
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,570
- You're at the Oscars.

371
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:56,320
- You're at the Oscars
and you're on stage.

372
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,207
- And you've just accepted.

373
00:13:57,207 --> 00:13:58,230
- And this is for all the marbles.

374
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:02,980
You're about to win the
Academy Award and you're 15.

375
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:03,850
How do you feel?

376
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,310
Are you freaking out?

377
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,143
- [Girls] Yes.

378
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:10,016
- This girl has no freak-out, apparently.

379
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,880
She does not freak out.
- She's so poised.

380
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,620
- It's amazing to see, as you were saying,

381
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,290
a 15-year-old with that kind of poise

382
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,200
and the talent and the skill,

383
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,810
but I too, I mean, I don't have kids,

384
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,220
but I too was thinking
about just like how--

385
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,400
- I can't get them to hang
up their towel on a hook.

386
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,330
- Yeah, how disciplined, how disciplined

387
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,163
one must be as a young child.

388
00:14:26,163 --> 00:14:30,790
- Hang up your towel on a hook
so it doesn't get mildewed.

389
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:33,186
You can use a towel more than once.

390
00:14:33,186 --> 00:14:35,644
(Ryan laughs)
Right?

391
00:14:35,644 --> 00:14:40,260
(audience cheers and applauds)

392
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,630
- Just 'cause my mom used to say that,

393
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,656
I now leave them on the
floor, just to spite.

394
00:14:43,656 --> 00:14:44,602
- You just deliberately
leave them on the floor.

395
00:14:44,602 --> 00:14:45,740
- Yeah, then I have to pick them up.

396
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,050
- Atta boy.

397
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,960
- I can't remember in years past,

398
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,000
I was watching some of the Wimbledon

399
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,670
and they split screen action.

400
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,000
They're very, they assume--

401
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,143
- [Man] They do have more of that

402
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,900
that we have a lot of capacity as viewers,

403
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,400
'cause they're watching two
matches at the same time.

404
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,420
- What do you mean?

405
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,330
You mean they play two matches?

406
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:02,950
I thought they split screen so you don't

407
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:03,927
have to do this the whole time.

408
00:15:03,927 --> 00:15:07,210
- No, they split screen two action shots.

409
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,996
They did, I was like.

410
00:15:08,996 --> 00:15:10,560
They're very ambitious
and they think that I have

411
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,340
a lot of capacity to
understand what's going on

412
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,920
but you can watch two matches at once.

413
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,850
I had not seen that before.

414
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:18,830
I've seen the split
where they're volleying

415
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:22,340
but this was a split of live
action, two different courts.

416
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,326
Really challenging.

417
00:15:23,326 --> 00:15:24,680
(audience laughs)

418
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,693
I was exhausted--

419
00:15:25,693 --> 00:15:27,930
- Right.
- after watching.

420
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,783
- It sounds exhausting.

421
00:15:29,783 --> 00:15:34,783
And the whole scoring system
is always challenging for me.

422
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,400
Because it goes in, what is it, 15.

423
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,233
It goes by 15.

424
00:15:40,233 --> 00:15:41,066
- [Man] Oh yeah, 15, 30.

425
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:41,990
- Until you get to 40.

426
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:44,870
- Yeah, and I'm like, I
don't know what comes next.

427
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:48,390
- Add in, add out, your love,
my love, our love, we love.

428
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,490
Today, we love the show.

429
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,537
Today on the show, Kumail
Nanjiani is with us.

430
00:15:52,537 --> 00:15:54,150
(audience applauds)
He's got a great new movie.

431
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,853
It's very funny, Stuber.

432
00:15:57,359 --> 00:15:58,447
We'll see him again.

433
00:15:59,827 --> 00:16:01,570
- And Bernadette Peters is back.

434
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,817
She's brought some pups
who are up for adoption.

435
00:16:03,817 --> 00:16:07,585
(audience applauds)
- There is a lab mix.

436
00:16:07,585 --> 00:16:08,418
- Are you looking?

437
00:16:08,418 --> 00:16:10,750
- I'm not looking, but there's a lab mix

438
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,860
and I'm a sucker for a lab.

439
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,610
And we're gonna see if we
know the facts about our dogs

440
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:18,639
when we play a game of Truth or Tail.

441
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,260
(audience applauds)
- Get it?

442
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,093
- I got it.

443
00:16:22,188 --> 00:16:23,390
- Get it?

444
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,920
- But now it's time for Stump
the Hosts travel trivia.

445
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,753
Let's do it.

446
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:29,505
(audience applauds and cheers)

447
00:16:29,505 --> 00:16:31,922
- [Audience] Stump the Hosts.

Christine Mills from
Bohemia, is that right?

454
00:16:47,675 --> 00:16:48,667
Bohemia, Long Island.

455
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:50,619
- Yay, woo hoo.
(audience cheers)

456
00:16:50,619 --> 00:16:52,369
- [Ryan] Long Island.

457
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,650
- Bohemia, that sounds
like where I wanna live.

458
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,290
- [Christine] It's very exotic.

459
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:00,490
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you're very bohemian.

460
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,220

466
00:17:11,292 --> 00:17:13,950
- Oh, look at it.
- There she is.

467
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,620
- Look at her.
(speaker muffled by audience)

468
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:18,033
- Just look at it's majesty.

469
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,850
- So we've got Mitzi Hovre
from Dripping Springs, Texas

470
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:26,550
on the phone, who watches us on KVUE.

471
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,040
Good morning, Mitzi, how are you?

472
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,610
- [Mitzi] Hi, I'm good. How are y'all?

473
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:32,410
- We're great.
- We're good, thanks.

474
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:33,404
- What are you up to this morning?

475
00:17:33,404 --> 00:17:34,378
- [Mitzi] Good.

476
00:17:34,378 --> 00:17:35,533
Oh, I was just fixing

477
00:17:35,533 --> 00:17:37,590
to go running with my daughter

478
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:42,140
and y'all called, so I
get to take the day off.

479
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,540
- Were you gonna go running?

480
00:17:44,725 --> 00:17:46,114
- [Mitzi] Yeah, I was gonna go running,

481
00:17:46,114 --> 00:17:49,050
but now I don't have to.
(audience laughs)

482
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,108
= No, you can still run.

483
00:17:50,108 --> 00:17:50,941
This won't take long.
- I just want you to know,

484
00:17:50,941 --> 00:17:53,203
this phone call is gonna
take about two minutes.

485
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,030
- You shouldn't blow
off your run for this.

486
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,720
As a matter of fact, we'll speed it up

487
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,442
right now so you can get to it.

488
00:18:00,442 --> 00:18:01,275
- [Mitzi] Okay.
- We've got

489
00:18:01,275 --> 00:18:02,630
- two statements from Mitzi.

490
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,520
We're trying to guess which one is true.

491
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,059
If you stump us, you win the mug, okay?

492
00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:07,892
- [Mitzi] Okay.

493
00:18:07,892 --> 00:18:09,830
- First of her statements,
when I was younger,

494
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:12,300
I could stick my entire fist in my mouth.

495
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,470
- Oh, I know somebody that can do that.

496
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,787
- [Mitzi] You do?

497
00:18:16,787 --> 00:18:17,880
- Yeah, I do, I do.

498
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,820
- You can call me by my name.

499
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,270
- [Mitzi] Oh yeah.

500
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,920
- Can you do that too?

501
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,516
I've never tried it.

502
00:18:23,516 --> 00:18:25,166
If anything, now is not the time.

503
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,740
Or, I made it to the semi-finals

504
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,300
of the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader tryouts.

505
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,552
- Oh my gosh, I so wanna believe that.

506
00:18:33,552 --> 00:18:35,150
- [Mitzi] Oh. (laughs)

507
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,593
- Okay, so I'm looking at you.

508
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:40,123
I'm trying to figure out,

509
00:18:40,123 --> 00:18:42,250
I wish your hand was in this photo

510
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,474
So I could see your mouth to fist ratio.

511
00:18:45,474 --> 00:18:47,310
(audience and Ryan laugh)

512
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,340
- So she could scale it.

513
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,610
- [Mitzi] Really we can, yeah.

514
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:55,100
- Okay, so what was the key to
making it to the semi-finals

515
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,410
in the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleader tryouts?

516
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:03,010
- [Mitzi] Well, you had
to have your own vignette

517
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,920
and you had to do it for 90 seconds

518
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,190
and my aunt was a, she was a dancer,

519
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:12,560
so she taught me a dance ahead of time

520
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,440
and then you had to go and perform

521
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,140
and you did it as a
group and everybody just,

522
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,404
they played music and you
just kind of dance around.

523
00:19:22,404 --> 00:19:25,283
I knew what I was gonna do, so I did that.

524
00:19:26,329 --> 00:19:27,162
- Hmmm.

525
00:19:28,237 --> 00:19:29,270
- Suspect.
- Okay.

526
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,103
- [Man] Discover her.

527
00:19:30,103 --> 00:19:30,936
- Yeah, how did you discover your talent?

528
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:31,769
- Yeah, how'd you discover your fist--

529
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:32,602
(gong sounds)

530
00:19:32,602 --> 00:19:33,435
- Oh shoot.
- Talent.

531
00:19:33,435 --> 00:19:35,628
- How'd you discover your fist talent?

532
00:19:35,628 --> 00:19:37,550
- [Mitzi] You know, I don't know.

533
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:41,260
I just used to do that and
a boy in my junior high,

534
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,340
he did it too and so we got put,

535
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,860
our pictures got put in the yearbook

536
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,251
puttin' our fists in our mouths.

537
00:19:48,251 --> 00:19:52,130
Then I had to quit in high school.

538
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:54,280
I guess my fists got a little bit big,

539
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,662
'cause I started ripping
the sides of my mouth.

540
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:58,400
- [Man] Ow.
(audience moans)

541
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,233
- That sounds dangerous.

542
00:19:59,233 --> 00:20:00,968
- This is taking a dark turn.

543
00:20:00,968 --> 00:20:02,303
- Let's see, what does the audience think?

544
00:20:02,303 --> 00:20:03,863
What do you guys think?

545
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,703
Wow.

546
00:20:05,703 --> 00:20:06,910
See, okay, so okay.

547
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,860
I used to watch that show, you know,

548
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:12,121
about the Dallas Cowboy
Cheerleader tryouts,

549
00:20:12,121 --> 00:20:13,550
they had a show on, y'all--

550
00:20:14,474 --> 00:20:15,680
- Y'all remember?
- Y'all wanna say y'all,

551
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,810
y'all remember that show?
- Y'all remember that?

552
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:22,170
- And I remember them having
a very choreographed routine

553
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:25,670
that they had to memorize
in like one second.

554
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:29,240
I don't remember that
being able to freestyle.

555
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,073
- I agree, and I thought--

556
00:20:30,073 --> 00:20:32,900
- [Mitzi] You know, the freestyle
is the very beginning one.

557
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,670
That's the pre-round,
and then the semi-finals

558
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,430
is when they teach you a dance

559
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,263
- Now we're in trouble.

560
00:20:38,263 --> 00:20:39,096
- [Mitzi] and then you do a kick routine

561
00:20:39,096 --> 00:20:39,929
- [Man] All right, lock it in guys.

562
00:20:39,929 --> 00:20:40,762
Lock it in.
- and you're

563
00:20:40,762 --> 00:20:41,595
- [Mitzi] Performing
in front of the judges.

564
00:20:41,595 --> 00:20:42,428
- But that's not what you said

565
00:20:42,428 --> 00:20:44,920
when I questioned you under
intensive questioning, Mitzi.

566
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,070
- [Man] Lock it in.

567
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,610
- Remember, I said.
- I was right here.

568
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:48,776
- Right, you were here for it.

569
00:20:48,776 --> 00:20:49,609
- I was here, I was right here.

570
00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:51,002
- We were all right here, the witnesses.

571
00:20:51,002 --> 00:20:52,370
- All right, what are we going with?

572
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:53,203
- I don't know.
- Originally I thought--

573
00:20:53,203 --> 00:20:54,284
- I wanna say fist in mouth.

574
00:20:54,284 --> 00:20:55,117
- That's what I thought too.

575
00:20:55,117 --> 00:20:57,800
- And because I'm looking at her great,

576
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,990
beautiful, wide smile,
(Mitzi laughs)

577
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:03,100
- Which also could work
to the cheerleading thing,

578
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,580
but I think it's fist in mouth, guys.

579
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,010
- We're going against the audience.

580
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:06,843
- What do you thinK?

581
00:21:06,843 --> 00:21:08,323
- Is it fist in mouth?

582
00:21:09,505 --> 00:21:10,901
- [Mitzi] That's true.

583
00:21:10,901 --> 00:21:14,012
(everyone cheers)

584
00:21:14,012 --> 00:21:14,993
- Got it.

585
00:21:14,993 --> 00:21:16,853
Go with the gut always, right?

586
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,280
You haven't lost it, you got it.

587
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,113
- I still got it.

588
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,840
- Well, even though
you didn't win the mug,

589
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,673
we're gonna spin the wheel

590
00:21:23,673 --> 00:21:24,638
and see what you're playing for here.

591
00:21:24,638 --> 00:21:25,510
(wheel clicks)

592
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,343
Still got it.

593
00:21:26,343 --> 00:21:29,176
(audience cheers)

594
00:21:31,742 --> 00:21:34,790
- Be nice though if you
could do that, yeah.

595
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:35,688
- All right, what do we have?

596
00:21:35,688 --> 00:21:36,730
- Ooh, this is a great prize.

Good luck.

604
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:57,923

606
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,920
we talked with Ricky Gervais.

607
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:05,920
In what town outside London
did Ricky say he lives?

608
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:07,700
- [Mitzi] Okay, what town?

609
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,633
Oh, it was Hampstead.

610

625
00:22:46,986 --> 00:22:49,300
- [Mitzi] I have kind of a sad story.

626
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,150
We came to New York, we planned our trip

627
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:55,160
around y'all last year and then, you know,

628
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,360
'cause you can't get
tickets until a few months

629
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,070
ahead of time, they don't put it on there,

630
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:05,070
and then, we were there
right when y'all were gone.

631
00:23:06,372 --> 00:23:07,563
We were gonna come.
- Ohhh.

632
00:23:07,563 --> 00:23:09,390
- You mean for vacation.

633
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:10,576
- [Man] Yeah, but now you have a better--

634
00:23:10,576 --> 00:23:11,409
- But listen.
- But now

635
00:23:11,409 --> 00:23:12,242
- you're gonna take vacation.

636
00:23:12,242 --> 00:23:13,677
- You're gonna take a trip and
tickets are not hard to get.

637
00:23:13,677 --> 00:23:17,067
(audience cheers)
They're free.

638
00:23:17,067 --> 00:23:19,038
- Right, we'll put you on the list.

639
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:19,897
- [Mitzi] Thanks y'all.

640
00:23:19,897 --> 00:23:20,730
- Oh, they're not easy.

641
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:22,680
- We'll put you, you know what,

642
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,690
but she's on the phone with us.

643
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,480
We can put her on hold
and give her tickets

644
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,313
for when she comes back.

645
00:23:27,313 --> 00:23:28,492
- [Man] Yeah, if she's here,
we'll give her tickets.

646
00:23:28,492 --> 00:23:29,470
- Yeah, we'll put--

647
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:32,354
- We're gonna work this out
and get you on your run, okay?

648
00:23:32,354 --> 00:23:33,510
- [Mitzi] Oh, thank you.
(audience laughs)

649
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:34,660
- All right Mitzi, listen.

650
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,493
One more thing.

651
00:23:35,493 --> 00:23:37,210
You have to help us make the day

652
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:38,980
of a lucky member of our studio audience

653
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:41,560
who's gonna receive a
$500 gift certificate

654
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,850
from Barnes & Noble,
so please pick a number

655
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:47,498
(audience cheers)
between one and 212.

656
00:23:47,498 --> 00:23:50,380
- [Mitzi] Okay, number 28.

657
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,900
- Which one?

658
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,810
- [Mitzi] 28.

659
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:54,385
- [Both] 28.

660
00:23:54,385 --> 00:23:57,009
- Right there.
(audience yells and cheers)

661
00:23:57,009 --> 00:23:58,160
- Congratulations.

662
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,530
Mitzi, have a good job.

663
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:01,530

this is just a grip

673
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:25,570
like this is just a curve

But here, it becomes something more.

- Good to see you.

688

Welcome back.

690
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:07,040
- Thank you.

691
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,558
Guys, why is it so smoky in here?

692
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:11,441
What is going on?

693
00:25:11,441 --> 00:25:12,620
- Thank you for noticing.

694
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:16,940
Apparently, they are special
effects for our trivia game.

695
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:17,880
- You can injure a lot of people

696
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,211
with this fist in mouth chat.

697
00:25:20,211 --> 00:25:21,551
(audience and Ryan laugh)

698
00:25:21,551 --> 00:25:22,384
- Do you know it?

699
00:25:22,384 --> 00:25:23,217
- Can I do that?

700
00:25:23,217 --> 00:25:24,050
- Yeah, I'm asking.
- No.

701
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:26,472
- I'm not gonna try it, nice try.

702
00:25:26,472 --> 00:25:27,950
No.

703
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:30,990
- Now you, as I shook your
hand, I notice that you've got--

704
00:25:32,141 --> 00:25:32,974
(beep)

705
00:25:32,974 --> 00:25:35,160
...don't believe that
it's a flying saucer.

706
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,770
I believe that it's an
unidentified flying object,

707
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:38,603
which could be--

708
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:40,490
- Well, you think like
a saucer and a teacup.

709
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:41,429
- Yeah, no.
- It's not that.

710
00:25:41,429 --> 00:25:42,610
- No, I don't believe that they--

711
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:45,280
- We are arguing about the shape of it?

712
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,937
- I believe that there, I don't even,

713
00:25:46,937 --> 00:25:48,920
and the military says that they don't know

714
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,217
but I think they have to know, right?

715
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:52,779
- I like that you're
air-quoting everything.

716
00:25:52,779 --> 00:25:53,678
They don't know

717
00:25:53,678 --> 00:25:55,720
but they have to know.
- But they have to know.

718
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,553
- But they, yeah, whisper.

719
00:25:56,553 --> 00:25:58,520
Whisper, they won't hear us.

720
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,270
Did you recently throw the first
pitch at the baseball game?

721
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,887
- I threw the first pitch, yeah.

722
00:26:02,887 --> 00:26:05,187
(audience laughs)

723
00:26:05,187 --> 00:26:06,510
- [Ryan] Did it go over the plate?

724
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:08,670
- [Kelly] Okay, wait, wait, wait.

725
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,588
- [Kumail] It went over the plate.

726
00:26:10,588 --> 00:26:12,938
- Okay, can we show that
picture one more time?

727
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:17,050
That looks like a staged photo,

728
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:20,930
like they almost superimposed
your head onto an action shot.

729
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:22,820
- Yeah, I'm in front of a green screen.

730
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,503
I threw out the first pitch.

731
00:26:26,255 --> 00:26:27,470
- That's a great shot.

732
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,960
- That photographer was amazing.

733
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,330
Every picture from there, I look

734
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:31,600
like Robert Redford or something.

735
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,380
- It's terrifying, isn't it?

736
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,720
I've done a night.

737
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,597
- How did it go for you?

738
00:26:35,597 --> 00:26:37,800
- It didn't go over the plate.
- Mmmm.

739
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,633
- What about you?

740
00:26:38,633 --> 00:26:40,688
- It went over the plate.

741
00:26:40,688 --> 00:26:42,520
Well, it didn't--

742
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,353
- Good for you.

743
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:45,514
- Thank you Daddy.
(Kumail laughs)

744
00:26:45,514 --> 00:26:47,254
Thank you Daddy.

745
00:26:47,254 --> 00:26:49,102
- Daddy, we're gonna talk to Daddy.

746
00:26:49,102 --> 00:26:51,820
More with Kumail about
what it's like to attend

747
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:55,140
his first WWE wrestling
match, right after the plug.

748
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,363
Stay with us.

749
00:26:56,363 --> 00:26:57,930

- [Announcer] Still ahead
on Live, Bernadette Peters.

751
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:05,270
- From WGLA 24-7 News, this
is Good Morning Washington.

752
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,540
On your side.

753
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,793
We begin with a breaking news alert.

754
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,590
- And we are following
breaking news right now.

755
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:15,900
Just an immense amount of rain
hitting the DMV right now.

756
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,690
Let's get right out to John
Gonzalez, who's in Arlington,

757
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:20,180
and last time we checked in with him,

758
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,482
just some incredible images.

759
00:27:21,482 --> 00:27:24,260
That red car behind you, John, submerged

760
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,900
and it looks like personal belongings

761
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,830
coming out of the doors
and into the water.

762
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:28,726
Good morning.

763
00:27:28,726 --> 00:27:32,520
- Just a good morning
and a scary situation.

764
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,630
Many scary situations this morning

765
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:36,440
throughout the entire D.C. area.

766
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,110
You know, we started off
reporting this morning

767
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,770
in Boyds, Maryland, doing something

768
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:42,090
completely unrelated on
the Women's World Cup

769
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:44,380
and the storm came through there first

770
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:47,370
and it continued down the I-270 corridor

771
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:51,700
and now it is coming through
Arlington and the D.C. city

772
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,590
with this unbelievable amount of rain

773
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,423
and take a look.

774
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:59,540
This is Kennebec Street
and 11th here in Arlington

775
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:02,340
and you can see that car, that Hundai,

776
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,890
is almost completely submerged.

777
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:05,980
There was a call.

778
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,560
We were hearing the scanners,
the emergency scanners,

779
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,810
and there was a call reported for a woman

780
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:13,860
on top of a stranded vehicle.

781
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,550
We believe that's the case here,

782
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:17,660
so the woman is no longer in the vehicle,

783
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,810
no longer on the roof of the vehicle,

784
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:23,660
so we are hoping that she's
been able to get some help.

785
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:27,130
That's the hope, and now
that car is just submerged,

786
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:29,570
but you can see just all
of the standing water here

787
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:31,710
and this happened in a matter of minutes.

788
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,585
I mean, we're talking torrential
rain, just too much rain

789
00:28:34,585 --> 00:28:38,277
in a short period of
time overwhelmed the area

790
00:28:38,277 --> 00:28:41,280
and you can see that car is now reversing.

791
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,710
You hear it all the time, I know

792
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:45,890
it sounds cliche, folks,
turn around, don't drown.

793
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,630
Well here's a perfect
situation, a perfect example

794
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:51,230
of what we talk about when
we say that on the air.

795
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,480
Here's a small vehicle,
another sedan similar

796
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,880
to the one that's stuck
just to the right of us,

797
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,770
trying to get through
that standing water here

798
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:00,160
right next to Westover Park and they are

799
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,330
having to now reverse, a very good idea,

800
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:03,800
but they're gonna have
to do that carefully

801
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,950
because you've got just as much

802
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,943
standing water now behind them.

803
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:10,030
Back to this vehicle here, red Hundai,

804
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:12,493
you see the bag on top
of the roof, Steve Rudin.

805
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,770
We're hoping for the best.

806
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:18,470
We're hoping that the news is good,

807
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:21,380
that this woman was able to
get out without any injuries.

808
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,502
We don't see any paramedics
or first responders

809
00:29:23,502 --> 00:29:26,280
right here directly where this vehicle is.

810
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,662
They are up the hill a bit,

811
00:29:27,662 --> 00:29:29,810
but just a scary situation, Steve.

812
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,350
Just too much rain.

813
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:33,540
The manhole is just
completely overwhelmed.

814
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:36,180
The sewer system just
can't take this much rain.

815
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,090
- All right John.

816
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:38,260
If we could just stay on this
picture here for a moment,

817
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:41,190
and this is exactly
what flash flooding is.

818
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:42,540
If you look at the topography,

819
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:46,460
you'll notice that it's sort
of in a low-lying area here

820
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,850
and when we looked over
toward the right earlier,

821
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:50,500
you could see there was a bit of a hill,

822
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,460
so all this water is cascading downward

823
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,750
and it's all pooling in this one location

824
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:59,380
and this is exactly what
flash flooding is all about.

825
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,149
It doesn't take very long,
it happens in a flash

826
00:30:02,149 --> 00:30:04,060
and it could happen in a minute,

827
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,500
it could happen in two minutes

828
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,760
and this is why you don't
go across the roads.

829
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,100
You just don't know how deep the water is.

830
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,660
You might say to yourself or think,

831
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:15,360
hey I've traveled this
route over and over again.

832
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,800
There's no problems at all.

833
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,440
It looks like it's two or three inches.

834
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,500
Before you know it, it's
six inches, it's ten inches,

835
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,840
it's two feet of water, and
once you get that much water,

836
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,070
your car is going to be shot and it's

837
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:29,850
not gonna be working and
it's not a good thing.

838
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:32,680
Johnny G, we'll let
him talk to that person

839
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,040
but this is what it looks
like right now over toward

840
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,450
Tenleytown and upper northwest
D.C., National Harbor.

841
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:40,370
Heavy rain continues to fall.

842
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:43,420
This has now been going
on for what 20, 25 minutes

843
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,290
with those torrential downpours.

844
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:49,760
395 heading into the city, at
least traffic is getting in

845
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,300
but I do think that because
of the timing of this storm,

846
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:57,030
the heavy rainmaker, that
a lot of folks have put off

847
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,860
leaving to go to work and a lot of people,

848
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:01,010
thank goodness, are still on vacation

849
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:03,360
because they're enjoying
the long holiday weekend.

850
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,740
The Whitehurst looking good,
at least in terms of movement.

851
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,550
Both directions headed
over toward Georgetown

852
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:11,760
and this right here is
over toward K Street

853
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,990
and the Kennedy Center.

854
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,920
Flash flood warning does continue.

855
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:18,320
All areas inside and close
to the Capital Beltway,

856
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,610
whether you are in
Silver Spring or Wheaton

857
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:23,510
or if you are in Anacostia, Oxen Hill,

858
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:25,549
National Harbor, Capitol
Hill, you get the point.

859
00:31:25,549 --> 00:31:28,340
Lots of wet weather on the way.

860
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:31,400
All this slowly drifts
on off toward the south.

861
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,730
Alexandria about another
half hour to 45 minutes

862
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:36,980
and then you are going
to start to dry out.

863
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,027
Along with the heavy rain,

864
00:31:38,027 --> 00:31:40,330
you may hear a few rumbles of thunder,

865
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:42,190
so if you're going to be driving about,

866
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:43,650
definitely use extreme caution.

867
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:44,800
Let's over to Veronica.

868
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:53,940
- A good portion of our area
under a flash flood emergency

869
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:58,230
right now and this could last
as late as two to 3 p.m. today

870
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,890
with the storms that
have been moving through

871
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:03,190
with the pockets of moderate
and some very heavy rain.

872
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:05,360
Flooding really is the main issue

873
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,810
over the next couple of hours.

874
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:08,840
I wanna go back to this
graphic, 'cause it really shows

875
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:12,060
the amount of rain that we
have received in some portions

876
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:15,260
of our area, not over a 12-hour period

877
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:19,090
but over in just an hour
to an hour and a half.

878
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:20,480
You're looking at some
of the roadways there,

879
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,990
Bradley River there, where the
water has at times been high.

880
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:28,080
We've seen that high
water in many locations

881
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,160
throughout Montgomery County, upwards

882
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,950
two three, four, close
to five inches of rain.

883
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:37,290
There's a look at McLean,
close to five inches of rain,

884
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:39,750
which is why we've seen those
water rescues occurring.

885
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:43,700
If it hasn't been high water
covering the roads near you,

886
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,440
it's been about the low visibility,

887
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,190
not just from the rainfall
rates, which have been high,

888
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:51,070
about one to two inches per hour,

889
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:55,280
but also the fog, that fog
deck really thickening up now.

890
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,490
Okay, so here's the latest on radar.

891
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:59,663
This is the area that we've been tracking

892
00:32:59,663 --> 00:33:02,410
over the last two, three hours

893
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:05,660
and you can see it right
here, now moving just

894
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,850
south and east of the district,

895
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:10,270
that southeast side of
the beltway right now,

896
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:13,140
through Prince George's County,
through Anne Arundel County

897
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:16,710
but also now Charles County
seeing some of that heavy rain

898
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,720
and eventually, this is
going to be passing off

899
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,500
to the northeast, so we may
see improving conditions,

900
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:25,110
but keep in mind the
roads in many instances

901
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,450
have been covered with water,

902
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:28,490
ponding with a lot of road spray,

903
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:29,830
but also the rivers and streams.

904
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,795
They're gonna continue to rise.

905
00:33:31,795 --> 00:33:33,610
What's an interesting feature right here

906
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:35,590
with this weather
boundary across the area,

907
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:37,600
you see this right here,
you've got this heavy rain

908
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,480
coming south and east and then this area

909
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,210
throughout Prince George's County,

910
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:44,520
throughout Calvert and
Saint Mary's, coming north.

911
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,100
That's convergent.

912
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,180
That's right along the
front and that means

913
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:50,130
that all that moisture in the atmosphere

914
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:52,780
is pooling right along this
weather boundary near us.

915
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,250
So for Fairfax, for
the district right now,

916
00:33:55,250 --> 00:34:00,250
just south of Bowie down 301,
down to 95 and areas east

917
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,610
of Manassas, that's where the
heaviest rain is right now.

918
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:05,240
These are the rainfall rates

919
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,660
at upwards two inches per hour.

920
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,470
Look at the visibility
out there right now.

921
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:13,190
This is just one of the
cameras, as we have one out just

922
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:15,640
a little bit showing you
the Capitol in the distance

923
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:19,610
where the visibilities have
dropped under a half mile.

924
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:22,080
Alexandria, you're seeing
that heavy rain right now.

925
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,550
Mount Vernon and areas toward Clinton,

926
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:28,820
soon heading into Brandywine,
soon heading into Indian Head

927
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:31,710
and soon also Waldorf, right down 301.

928
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:35,600
So if you live in this area
here throughout Charles County

929
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,720
throughout Saint Mary's
and Calvert County,

930
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,720
I'd say, don't get on the road right now.

931
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,070
If you can, wait about another
hour and a half to two hours.

932
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:46,700
Maybe you've got a doctor's
appointment somewhere.

933
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:49,200
Maybe your kids have summer camp.

934
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,210
I tell you what folks, they're better off

935
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:52,870
inside and so are you.

936
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:55,130
You're seeing these dark, shaded counties.

937
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:58,570
That's western Howard County
under a flash flood warning.

938
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:00,980
That is until 11:45 p.m.

939
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:03,870
Look at Montgomery County,
Gaithersburg, Germantown,

940
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:07,230
Damascus area over toward Potomac Falls,

941
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,450
as well as Laurel.

942
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:12,620
This also, your county
under a flash flood warning.

943
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:16,470
That continues too up until
11:15, so many of these going

944
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:19,530
as late as noon and as
mentioned, right down south

945
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:23,020
throughout Charles County and
areas soon to be Saint Mary's

946
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,800
and Calvert County that are
gonna go a little longer.

947
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,700
Hard to see there.

948
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,100
I wanna go back to that shot
because really the bridge,

949
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:32,370
the Woodrow Wilson Bridge,
obscured in the distance.

950
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:34,747
This is our National Harbor camera

951
00:35:34,747 --> 00:35:37,580
and you can see even the
top of the wheel there

952
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:41,110
really obscured by the low
cloud deck, the visibility

953
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:44,124
and the rain that has just
been pouring across the area.

954
00:35:44,124 --> 00:35:47,900
Here's a look at the Capitol
and another look at the radar.

955
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:51,210
Right now in the District, you
folks, if you're in Westin,

956
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:53,510
if you're in Adelphi, if you're in Bowie,

957
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:58,160
you may see some improvement
right now with that rain

958
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,970
that has just been pouring,
but for again, any of you,

959
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:04,030
if you live near some
creeks, streams, rivers,

960
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:06,830
know that the water still
could be rising quite high.

961
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:10,050
All this kind of flowing
from north to south.

962
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:11,650
Heavy rain continues across the area.

963
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:14,540
There's our I-270 camera
around Clarksburg Road,

964
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,660
but sitting not too far from me

965
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:20,420
is Adriana Hopkins and
Mel, who's been with us

966
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,476
all morning long as well, keeping an eye

967
00:36:22,476 --> 00:36:25,190
on what's been happening on social media

968
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:27,650
with this heavy rain that
of course we told you about

969
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:30,290
early this morning on
Good Morning Washington.

970
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:31,270
- Absolutely, Veronica

971
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:33,320
and this is where we really
want to encourage everyone

972
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,420
to follow our team on social media

973
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:38,140
because we do have people
all over the place.

974
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,490
As they were driving into work,

975
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:41,580
they got caught in this rain and storm

976
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,060
We have people, our crews,

977
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:45,503
that we've sent out to
look for these areas

978
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:48,100
where the roads are
flooded and where there

979
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,080
might be some water rescues
happening right now.

980
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:50,913
So really,

981
00:36:50,913 --> 00:36:52,150
- We were actually on the air earlier

982
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,430
and nothing was happening.

983
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:55,390
We were talking about we're expecting rain

984
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:56,350
and then all of the sudden,

985
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:58,491
sometime in the eight o'clock hour,

986
00:36:58,491 --> 00:37:02,400
the rain started falling very
heavily and as Sam Sweeney,

987
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,690
our live reporter, showed us,

988
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:06,040
he was out in Potomac
and Montgomery County,

989
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:09,150
and the flash flooding
just came up so suddenly

990
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,170
on some of these back roads.

991
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,740
They're totally washed out.

992
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,530
- [Adriana] Absolutely, and
looking here at the pictures

993
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:16,490
in the video that we have
from earlier this morning,

994
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:19,750
this is the GW Parkway that
you're looking at right here

995
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:23,750
and you can see just how much
water there is on the roads

996
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:28,100
and how this, as you said,
Melanie, happened immediately.

997
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,520
We knew that this was happening.

998
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,480
We knew it was coming, but
it all of a sudden just came

999
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,240
in torrential waves of water.

1000
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,780
This is in North Potomac right here.

1001
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:40,170
When I say follow our
team on social media,

1002
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:41,880
if you follow John Gonzalez right now,

1003
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,710
you can see that he is tweeting

1004
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,810
his view from Arlington right now.

1005
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:47,707
He says, "There's a lot of lightening.

1006
00:37:47,707 --> 00:37:49,030
"There is torrential rain."

1007
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:51,820
He said that manholes
there are overwhelmed

1008
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:54,840
and they've experienced a
number of road closures.

1009
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:58,330
There are people tweeting on
social media about our Metro.

1010
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:00,120
Virginia Square Metro Station

1011
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,810
has a major water leak right now.

1012
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:04,850
Here's a video right now of Arlington.

1013
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:08,060
You can see the visibility
there is extremely poor.

1014
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,140
The FAA has tweeted out this morning

1015
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,210
that there are several
major airports affected

1016
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:15,430
by this weather, from
Miami and Fort Lauderdale

1017
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:17,230
all the way up north to LaGuardia

1018
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:19,950
and those airports that
could experience delays,

1019
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:24,150
they do include Reagan and Dulles as well.

1020
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:27,890
Montgomery County dealing with
a lot of creeks and streams

1021
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:30,310
that are overflowing with water.

1022
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:33,640
This right here is right
outside of our studios

1023
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,680
here in Ross and you can see
people trying to make their way

1024
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,410
with these umbrellas, but
again, this rain is heavy

1025
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:43,677
and it is swift, and just
people trying to run through it

1026
00:38:43,677 --> 00:38:46,700
and get to some dry space.

1027
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,130
- It doesn't seem like with this system,

1028
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:52,360
Veronica hasn't mentioned
anything about thunderstorms

1029
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,640
or lightening or any high winds.

1030
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,360
It simply has been a
lot of water coming down

1031
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,580
and causing flooding problems.

1032
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:00,850
Our John Gonzalez is out
live for us right now.

1033
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:02,460
John, where are you and it looks like

1034
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,983
we've got a water rescue
behind you going on.

1035
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,440
- Yeah, well here's the situation.

1036
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,690
The first responders were here, Melanie,

1037
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:12,550
the Arlington County Fire Department,

1038
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,430
but they've moved on.

1039
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:16,110
They've got so many calls,
they made sure that everyone

1040
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:18,560
here in this neighborhood
is safe and they've moved on

1041
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,870
but you can see what was left behind.

1042
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:24,150
You have neighbors helping
the driver of this vehicle,

1043
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:26,620
trying to get her belongings
out of the vehicle.

1044
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,750
A couple of minutes ago, a
couple of guys were gonna try

1045
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,360
to push the car back.

1046
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,420
Not so sure that's a good idea,

1047
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,270
but this is the young
lady here, the driver,

1048
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:36,110
with the pink jacket.

1049
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:38,120
She tells me that the
car was actually parked

1050
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:41,040
and she came out to try to move
it because she saw the rain

1051
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,660
coming in strong and the
waters starting to pick up

1052
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,980
and she couldn't move it in time.

1053
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:51,140
So, that's the situation here
on Kennebec Street and 11th.

1054
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,338
You have a tremendous
amount of standing water.

1055
00:39:53,338 --> 00:39:57,070
Just flash flooding at it's best here

1056
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:57,903
and take a look at here.

1057
00:39:57,903 --> 00:39:59,640
This is next to the apartment building.

1058
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,640
You have the kiddos looking
out, witnessing something

1059
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,350
pretty dramatic and you
can see the walkway here.

1060
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:08,900
The stairwell is completely
flooded that leads

1061
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:12,130
to their apartments and just so much rain.

1062
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:14,490
That's what we've been
talking about this morning.

1063
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:17,270
Just so much rain in
a short period of time

1064
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:20,040
and a tremendous amount of flooding

1065
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,860
and you've also got lightening.

1066
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,890
This is right next to the Westover Park,

1067
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:24,990
just to give you a lay of the land.

1068
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:27,340
In fact, John, if you pan
over to the ball field,

1069
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:30,350
you can see the outfield
of the baseball field

1070
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:34,360
completely under water and
you have now several cars

1071
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:38,610
that were parked here on Kennebec
that are now under water.

1072
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:40,423
Some of the water is receding.

1073
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,090
This vehicle not as submerged as it was

1074
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:44,930
when we first arrived
about 20 minutes ago.

1075
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:46,960
That's the good news with
some of these storms.

1076
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,290
You get the water comes
in, the flash flooding,

1077
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:51,900
and then the waters recede pretty quickly,

1078
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,810
but it's very, very dangerous.

1079
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:56,290
We saw a man trying to
go down the road here.

1080
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:59,380
He quickly realized not a
good idea and he reversed.

1081
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,470
We were able to talk to him on camera.

1082
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:03,810
He says he had an
appointment he had to get to

1083
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:06,130
but he realized it was
just way too dangerous,

1084
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,301
not worth it, and you can
see some of these vehicles

1085
00:41:08,301 --> 00:41:10,920
are literally turning around as they see

1086
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:15,350
the standing water here at
11th and Kennebec in Arlington.

1087
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:18,370
All of this started in
the Boyds, Maryland area,

1088
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:22,360
Frederick County, and it
moved down the I-270 corridor.

1089
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,660
We were actually live up there,

1090
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:26,670
doing a story on the women
winning the World Cup,

1091
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:28,710
and the storm was almost following us

1092
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:31,160
as we came back down into Arlington

1093
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:35,550
and here you have it now, coming
through Arlington and D.C.

1094
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:37,010
Just a tremendous amount of rain.

1095
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:38,440
A very scary situation here

1096
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:41,781
but the good news is the driver is okay.

1097
00:41:41,781 --> 00:41:45,140
- Johnny, you mentioned that
you've been caught in the rain

1098
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:48,170
ever since this morning when
you were in Boyds, Maryland

1099
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:50,430
and suddenly the rain just poured down

1100
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:52,540
on you during one of our live shots.

1101
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:55,930
Explain what you have seen
so far from that moment,

1102
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:59,440
then you moved down to Arlington
and then where you are now,

1103
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,063
how did you see that
weather progress and change?

1104
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,940
- You know, we had a live report coming up

1105
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,690
at around seven o'clock this morning

1106
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:10,090
and we saw those clouds moving in

1107
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:11,930
and I told my photographer, John,

1108
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:15,790
something's about to drop
here, we better take some cover

1109
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:20,173
and within minutes, the rain
just came down, lightening.

1110
00:42:21,724 --> 00:42:25,980
It's interesting to watch,
almost like watching a radar,

1111
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:29,130
as we were driving down
270 onto the beltway,

1112
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:32,561
we can see the storm behind
us, literally following us,

1113
00:42:32,561 --> 00:42:36,010
and now we are here in
Arlington and it caught up to us

1114
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:37,280
and this is what it's creating.

1115
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,260
This is the same kind of
situation we were witnessing

1116
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:43,900
up north in upper Montgomery
County, Gaithersburg,

1117
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:46,640
Germantown, a number of road closures

1118
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,060
because of this very
thing, flash flooding,

1119
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:52,500
and now it has hit D.C. and Arlington

1120
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,470
and this is the situation.

1121
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:57,440
You've got, not necessarily cars that were

1122
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,630
on the road driving, but
cars that were parked

1123
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:02,200
and are now in the middle of the road.

1124
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,390
That's how powerful this water can be.

1125
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:05,990
When you have a tremendous
amount of water,

1126
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:08,170
the power is just enormous.

1127
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:10,510
You have now a gentleman who's pulled up

1128
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:11,490
in a pickup truck here.

1129
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:14,130
It looks like he's getting
ready to help this young lady

1130
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:16,853
try to get this car out of here.

1131
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,790
But just a dramatic scene.

1132
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:21,260
When we first got here, we were concerned

1133
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:23,310
that there were people
inside, maybe children,

1134
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:25,910
because you have little stuffed animals

1135
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:27,750
that came out of the
car, personal belongings

1136
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:29,920
that literally floated away.

1137
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,140
But the good news again, we've been able

1138
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,690
to talk to the driver, she
didn't want to talk on camera,

1139
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:36,260
but just a startling morning for her.

1140
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:40,590
She says, again, she
saw the standing water.

1141
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:44,630
She saw the road quickly
submerged and she tried

1142
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:46,990
to move her car and it was just too late.

1143
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:48,440
She did not have enough time.

1144
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:52,860
- All right, John, you
know, we were watching

1145
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:55,330
the situation unfold
behind you with that car

1146
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:57,820
and it's really a little
difficult for us to assess

1147
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:59,770
just how heavily the rain is coming down

1148
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:01,670
looking at the TV screen.

1149
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:02,830
What would you say right now?

1150
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:04,650
Is it a moderate rainfall?

1151
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:05,983
Is is tapering off any?

1152
00:44:08,996 --> 00:44:10,590
- I don't wanna use the word tapering off.

1153
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:13,470
It's lighter than it
was about 20 minutes ago

1154
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:16,140
here in Arlington, but it's
still raining a good amount.

1155
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:18,820
I don't know if you can see
it off the umbrella here.

1156
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:21,519
It's still coming down at a good clip.

1157
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:25,490
Not torrential, the way we
saw it in Boyds this morning

1158
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:28,770
and as we came down the I-270
corridor into the beltway,

1159
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:30,440
but again, still a
tremendous amount of rain.

1160
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,960
You can probably see it on
top of the standing water.

1161
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,680
The drops falling on the standing water,

1162
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,420
so that gives you an idea of just

1163
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:40,413
how much rain we're still
getting, Veronica, in this area.

1164
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:43,830
Again, these gentlemen here
trying to help this lady,

1165
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:47,050
Veronica, were gonna try to
move the car on their own

1166
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:48,033
and good thing they didn't,

1167
00:44:48,033 --> 00:44:49,730
because that's never a good idea.

1168
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:52,750
- Yeah, Johnny, that is
actually just an amazing shot.

1169
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:55,286
Of course, we've seen some
other water rescues going on

1170
00:44:55,286 --> 00:44:58,380
across the area similar to that.

1171
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:01,680
Wanna go ahead and, if we
can split the screen again

1172
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,750
and put the video back up,

1173
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:05,320
because one thing I want you to know.

1174
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,500
I was in Ellicott City, Maryland,

1175
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:10,890
for both flash flood events,
flash flood emergency events.

1176
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:12,940
That's why it's called flash flooding,

1177
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:16,400
because it can occur in
a flash, where you have

1178
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:20,300
that much water that
accumulates so quickly.

1179
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,240
That shot not as dramatic as the shot

1180
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,280
that we were just seeing
there with Johnny Gonzalez,

1181
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:27,870
but again, that's the reason
that we call it flash flooding;

1182
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:31,600
where the water comes up in
a hurry has nowhere to go.

1183
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,750
Especially if you're in an area,

1184
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:35,020
if you're traveling through an area

1185
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:37,860
or if you live in an area
with a lot of concrete,

1186
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,130
the ground cannot pick up that water.

1187
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:43,310
It cannot take in that water and you know,

1188
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:47,010
we've had six back-to-back
days with heavy rain

1189
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:49,000
during the afternoon with
some of these summer storms.

1190
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,280
Well, there's a look at the capital wheel.

1191
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,160
Again, you're saying what capital wheel?

1192
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:52,993
Where is it?

1193
00:45:52,993 --> 00:45:55,460
It's on the far, left-hand
portion of your screen,

1194
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:58,720
really hard to see as heavy rain continues

1195
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,847
through the nation's capital,
here in the Capital Metro area

1196
00:46:00,847 --> 00:46:03,480
and there's a look, in
fact, of the Capitol dome.

1197
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,190
You're seeing just a little bit of it

1198
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:07,820
in the distance there
in that bright white.

1199
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:11,480
What typically is morning
for us where by this time

1200
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,780
we can see a little better,

1201
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:16,380
over the last hour and
a half to two hours,

1202
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:19,480
we've seen that heavy rain
make its way through the area.

1203
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,100
Here's a look at Clarksburg Road.

1204
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:24,630
This is I-270, where some
of the heaviest has already

1205
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:28,630
come through, but I betcha if
you're in northern, western

1206
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:30,770
Montgomery County, you're
probably still seeing the creeks,

1207
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:34,690
streams all still continue
to come up across the area.

1208
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:35,900
Here's a look at the radar loop.

1209
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:38,170
You heard Johnny Gonzalez
say where he was this morning

1210
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:40,000
up in Frederick County, Maryland.

1211
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,670
This is where he was earlier.

1212
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:45,570
He's really traveled with
that line down to the south

1213
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:48,840
into the metro area,
now just south and east

1214
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,970
about ready to pull into portions

1215
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:53,340
of northern Charles County.

1216
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:56,570
Look at Dunkirk, still some
lightening with that near 301

1217
00:46:56,570 --> 00:47:00,050
and south of Bowie, so we may
see improvement conditions

1218
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:02,580
to the north here around
Damascus, around Gaithersburg,

1219
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:05,770
Laurel, Ellicott City, but
still down to the south,

1220
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:08,300
where those flash flood warnings continue

1221
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:11,030
and flash flood emergency
all the way south now

1222
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:15,100
into Charles County just
past noon today until 1 p.m.,

1223
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:18,000
we'll continue to have that
threat of flash flooding.

1224
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,560
Let's go back to Johnny Gonzalez,

1225
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,260
who has more on that water rescue.

1226
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:24,490
- And Veronica, we're
seeing some progress.

1227
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:26,370
Just in the last few minutes, an update.

1228
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:30,700
You can see the Hundai Elantra
here is now out of the water

1229
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:33,760
but well, you can see it's
got some drying out to do.

1230
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,710
This car was almost completely
submerged when we arrived,

1231
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:39,620
the driver telling us that the car

1232
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:41,950
was parked here on
Kennebec Street and 11th.

1233
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:44,170
She saw the water starting to pick up

1234
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:46,590
and she tried to move it but
she didn't have enough time

1235
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:48,840
and this gentleman here, Mike, came by

1236
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:49,673
in his Ford F-150.

1237
00:47:49,673 --> 00:47:51,110
You didn't get called,

1238
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:52,840
you just happened to come across this.

1239
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,830
- No, I was running an errand this morning

1240
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,790
and I got caught in it and I
was stuck in traffic everywhere

1241
00:47:57,790 --> 00:48:00,590
and then I figured I'd be close to home

1242
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:02,310
and then I saw them locked up

1243
00:48:02,310 --> 00:48:05,240
and I always say it's not bad weather,

1244
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:08,120
it's bad preparation, so you
always got the gear with you,

1245
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:11,410
got the frog togs and just
decided to cruise around

1246
00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:13,220
and see if there is anything
I can do in my neighborhood.

1247
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:14,380
- You made pretty quick work of this.

1248
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:15,930
How dangerous is something like this,

1249
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:18,270
when you have folks that may be driving.

1250
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:21,120
We saw a guy try to get
through something like this.

1251
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,860
You seem like you're maybe
more experienced than others

1252
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:24,910
in a situation like this.

1253
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:25,743
How dangerous can this be?

1254
00:48:25,743 --> 00:48:27,290
- Well, you know, there's
always a risk when you're trying

1255
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:30,160
to ford a river or any
sort of standing water

1256
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:34,210
and it's, around here, I
figured I know the landscape

1257
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:36,110
pretty well, I know
how deep the roads are.

1258
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:37,540
You can see some certain points,

1259
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:39,210
like halfway up a fire hydrant

1260
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:40,910
might only be a couple feet deep,

1261
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:43,210
so you can use some sort of inferences

1262
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:45,210
to know how deep it is,
but it's always a risk.

1263
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:47,570
Unless you have a larger
vehicle, I wouldn't recommend it,

1264
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:49,610
especially with some of the smaller,

1265
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:52,070
low-profile sedans and whatnot.

1266
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:53,480
- Mike, thanks so much and again, thanks

1267
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:56,520
for helping this young
lady get out of the water.

1268
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,420
John, if you pan the
camera, you can see her now

1269
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:00,870
trying to collect some of
her personal belongings

1270
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:03,390
that literally floated out of the vehicle

1271
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:06,700
and even in the last couple of
minutes since we last talked,

1272
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:09,470
Veronica, you can see what I said earlier.

1273
00:49:09,470 --> 00:49:12,640
These...been talking
about the flash flooding

1274
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:15,270
and as quickly as it comes
through, the water recedes.

1275
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:17,850
In about 10 minutes, there's
not gonna be any problem here.

1276
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:21,011
You're gonna see, not a dry
road, but no standing water

1277
00:49:21,011 --> 00:49:23,510
and that's what's amazing
about a situation like this.

1278
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:25,209
That quickly, in just a matter of minutes,

1279
00:49:25,209 --> 00:49:27,850
you can find yourself in a big problem

1280
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:29,570
and again, you have vehicles
at the top of the hill here

1281
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:32,970
on Kennebec trying to,
well, they're attempting,

1282
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:35,910
but that vehicle there, the
black SUV doing the smart thing,

1283
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:39,110
turning around, and that
white vehicle, there you go.

1284
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:41,130
You don't wanna try to
cross something like this

1285
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:43,060
because it just takes a matter of seconds

1286
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:44,750
to get yourself in a lot of trouble.

1287
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:46,232
Veronica, back to you inside.

1288
00:49:46,232 --> 00:49:48,360
- That's right and that's
why on days when we talk

1289
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,870
about the possibility of
flash flooding, when we say

1290
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:54,230
that the area is under
a flash flood watch,

1291
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:56,500
that's when you need to
prepare early in the day

1292
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:59,870
and that's why it's a good idea
to stay with Storm Watch 7,

1293
00:49:59,870 --> 00:50:03,120
always have that Storm Watch
7 weather app ready to go.

1294
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,280
Make sure the notifications are turned on

1295
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,770
because should there be
a flash flood emergency,

1296
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:11,870
you bet my phone went off
this morning several times

1297
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:15,520
with all the warnings and
emergencies that we already had.

1298
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,410
So how much longer, again,
until two, 3 p.m. today,

1299
00:50:18,410 --> 00:50:21,330
big story today is that heavy
rain, that very heavy rain

1300
00:50:21,330 --> 00:50:24,000
that will continue to
move through our area.

1301
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,312
I've put on a couple of amounts here

1302
00:50:26,312 --> 00:50:28,990
in terms of rainfall of
what we've seen already.

1303
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:32,280
Look at Addison Height,
2.4 inches of rain.

1304
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:36,960
2.8 inches of rain just
south of Hall's Hill area

1305
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,850
and just north of McLean,
close to 5 inches of rain.

1306
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:43,950
Again, this not in a 12- or 24-hour period

1307
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:46,100
a lot of times when we show those amounts,

1308
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:49,040
but this in an hour to an hour and a half.

1309
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,870
So all that rain comes up very quickly,

1310
00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:55,190
comes out of the storm
drains where the storm drains

1311
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:58,230
can't take the water, so
it just sits on the road

1312
00:50:58,230 --> 00:51:00,220
and increases very quickly.

1313
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:03,720
Just in a foot of road, can
start to carry your car away

1314
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:06,280
in two feet of water very easily.

1315
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,670
So that much water, don't ever attempt

1316
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:10,110
to drive across a flooded road.

1317
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:12,970
Look at western portions
of Montgomery County

1318
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:13,930
there around Rockville.

1319
00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:17,510
This is just west of
270, 3.4 inches of rain.

1320
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:19,740
These are some of the totals throughout

1321
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:22,060
and this loop over the last three hours,

1322
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:24,070
we're doing a little better
here in Loudoun County.

1323
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:26,170
In Montgomery County,
you heard Johnny Gonzalez

1324
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:28,480
just mention how things
are starting to improve.

1325
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,980
The water starting to recede,
but it'll take some time

1326
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:32,690
perhaps for the creeks,
the rivers, the streams,

1327
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:34,350
if you live anywhere there.

1328
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:36,190
I know your kids out of school today.

1329
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:37,830
Maybe they're not at summer camp.

1330
00:51:37,830 --> 00:51:41,890
Make sure they're not in the
backyard playing near those

1331
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:44,410
if you live in some of
these areas, 'cause again,

1332
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:46,350
we've already had a
number of water rescues.

1333
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:47,290
Your heaviest rain now with
some lightening right here,

1334
00:51:47,290 --> 00:51:52,290
coming through Prince George's
County, right around 301,

1335
00:51:53,830 --> 00:51:56,570
crossing over, making its way very slowly

1336
00:51:56,570 --> 00:52:00,080
to the east and southeast,
so soon Waldorf, soon Dunkirk

1337
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,860
and eventually Prince
Frederick, making its way

1338
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:05,710
south from Bowie and south of Annapolis,

1339
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:07,510
you folks doing a bit better.

1340
00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:10,300
So we're gonna see improving
conditions on area roads,

1341
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:12,150
but that too is going to take awhile.

1342
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:14,850
Heavy rain now, Alexandria
south to Mount Vernon.

1343
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:16,250
That's right down Route One.

1344
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:18,940
Some heavy rain too around areas of 301.

1345
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:21,900
This is south of Silver Hill
and down toward the Clinton

1346
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:26,530
area and Franconia, so if you
live in these areas, stay put.

1347
00:52:26,530 --> 00:52:30,110
Treat it just as you would a
severe thunderstorm warning

1348
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:34,620
or for that matter, any
elevated, severe warning

1349
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:37,410
that we get on the air and issue for you.

1350
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:40,013
This is kind of a life and death
situation with so much rain

1351
00:52:40,013 --> 00:52:41,990
that is falling across the area.

1352
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:43,300
For Howard County, you stay under that

1353
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,450
flash flood warning until 11:45.

1354
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:48,650
That's western portions of Howard County

1355
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:50,670
but even around Ellicott City and east

1356
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:53,000
toward Catonsville or up toward Baltimore.

1357
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,060
Probably still some ponding on area roads.

1358
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:57,790
Then right down the south
through the District.

1359
00:52:57,790 --> 00:53:00,410
That's Bowie, that's down
toward Charles County.

1360
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:01,750
That is where all this is going.

1361
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:02,670
Again, very slowly.

1362
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:04,430
This whole again started three hours ago

1363
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:07,170
and we're still dealing with
a heavy rain across the area.

1364
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:09,440
So lets talk about what's next for us.

1365
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:12,250
That is maybe some improving visibility

1366
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:13,340
by the time we get to noon.

1367
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:15,920
Right now it's at a
mile and a half in D.C.

1368
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,370
Just a couple minutes ago,
I was on the air showing you

1369
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:21,686
a half mile and it's improved
to Joint Base Andrews,

1370
00:53:21,686 --> 00:53:24,920
right now down at a half mile visibility.

1371
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:27,540
So throughout the day
today, we're gonna stay

1372
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:30,090
on a weather alert at least until noon,

1373
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:33,550
maybe one, two o'clock
before improving conditions.

1374
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:35,140
That rain isn't probably gonna end

1375
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:36,820
until about three, four o'clock.

1376
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:39,620
The rain easing and then
eventually clearing.

1377
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:43,500
So again, the very latest is
several flash flood emergencies

1378
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:44,753
continue across the area.

1379
00:53:44,753 --> 00:53:47,774
I know, Steve Rudin, you're
standing by with more

1380
00:53:47,774 --> 00:53:51,030
on some of the rainfall
totals and what's happening

1381
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:52,620
on social media right now.

1382
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:54,470
- Yeah and VJ, before we get to see,

1383
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:56,610
we wanna show you, everybody's
been talking about this rain

1384
00:53:56,610 --> 00:53:58,760
and they've been tweeting
out some amazing pictures,

1385
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:01,130
so let's take a look
at some of the flooding

1386
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:03,040
that we're seeing around our region,

1387
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,270
and over on the right side of your screen,

1388
00:54:04,270 --> 00:54:06,320
it looks like we got a
picture of an interstate there

1389
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,820
and it's just a wet mess.

1390
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:11,540
Here, you can see a closer
up picture with some ponding

1391
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:12,696
and where is this exactly?

1392
00:54:12,696 --> 00:54:14,610
- [Adriana] This is Sam Sweeney's pictures

1393
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:16,010
that he's tweeting out on social media.

1394
00:54:16,010 --> 00:54:18,640
You can follow him at sweeneyabc.

1395
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,493
Basically, this is right outside of Dulles

1396
00:54:20,493 --> 00:54:23,470
and the FAA has already sent
out a tweet to everyone,

1397
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:25,840
letting people know that
if you're flying out,

1398
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:29,500
check your flight times
because they could be delayed.

1399
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:32,810
Several areas right now
dealing with some bad weather,

1400
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:34,870
from Miami and Fort Lauderdale

1401
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:36,450
all the way up north to LaGuardia.

1402
00:54:36,450 --> 00:54:39,630
Reagan and Dulles, the FAA
says, could have some delays

1403
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:40,700
because of this weather.

1404
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:43,840
But this is what you're
seeing around Dulles.

1405
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:46,070
Just the flash flooding
and the flooding there

1406
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:47,608
and Steve, you were
talking just a minute ago

1407
00:54:47,608 --> 00:54:51,580
while Veronica was updating
everyone in terms of the radar.

1408
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:54,323
How much rain have we
seen and in how much time?

1409
00:54:54,323 --> 00:54:57,340
- There have been jackpot
zones and Veronica and I

1410
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:59,780
have been showing you all
morning long those jackpot zones

1411
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:04,170
in Arlington, over toward
McLean, over toward Potomac.

1412
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:07,270
Then you head over into
eastern Montgomery County,

1413
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:09,250
where not as much rain has fallen,

1414
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:10,960
but upwards of two to four inches,

1415
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,130
that is the safe bet right now,

1416
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:14,680
but I would not be surprised...
