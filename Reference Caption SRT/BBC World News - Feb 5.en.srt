- [Announcer] Then, she
ruled the UK for decades.

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,540
Don't miss a new season of Victoria,

4
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,433
British television at its best.

00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:31,073
- [Announcer] This is
BBC World News America.

(intense electronic music)

14
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,240
- Wow.

15
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,553
- That is unbelievable.

♪ Trying so hard not to let it show ♪

17

- Yes.

24
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,703
- [Announcer] And now, BBC World News.

25
00:01:22,971 --> 00:01:25,890
(intense electronic music)

26
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,240
- This is BBC World News America.

27
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,650
Reporting from Washington,
I'm Laura Trevelyan.

28
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,130
Count down to the State
of the Union Address.

29
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,000
President Trump will call for unity

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,473
in front of a deeply divided Congress.

31
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,343
- [Nick] Mr. Neeson, are
you sorry for what you said?

32
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,550
- [Laura] Actor Liam
Neeson says he's no racist

33
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,940
after his desire for
revenge causes an uproar.

34
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:50,773
- Racist.

35
00:01:50,773 --> 00:01:52,270
- Photograph was the very first picture

36
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,533
I ever took in war.

37
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,080
- Plus Sir Don McCullin's camera captured

38
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,630
the human cost of battle.

39
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,713
We'll hear how he turned his
lens on the home front too.

40
00:02:17,021 --> 00:02:18,760
Welcome to our viewers
on public television

41
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,030
here in the US and around the globe.

42
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,120
Washington is poised

43
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,430
for tonight's State of the Union
Address by President Trump.

44
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,680
Aides say he'll call for
bipartisan cooperation and unity.

45
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,810
Mr. Trump will deliver
his primetime address

46
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,570
to a divided Congress,
one that's still smarting

47
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:37,430
after a 35-day partial government shutdown

48
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,740
over the president's call for
a border wall with Mexico.

49
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,400
For more on what we can expect tonight,

50
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,140
the BBC's Katty Kay joined me earlier.

51
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,040
White House aides say
that this address is going

52
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,360
to be all about committee,

53
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,730
but given just how
divided the two sides are,

54
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,173
can anything really be
achieved, do you think?

55
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,880
- Look, I think what the
president wants to do tonight is

56
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,460
to reach out to voters in the middle

57
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,210
with some sense of unity
and bipartisanship.

58
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,280
We'll hear that tone.

59
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,730
It's being written into
his speech at the moment,

60
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,230
and then also appeal to his base

61
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,470
with a tougher line on
immigration and that border wall.

62
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,730
President Trump knows
that he's not going to get

63
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,530
a television audience this big again

64
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,680
until the 2020 reelection
campaign is well under way,

65
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,240
so he's got that political
timetable in mind.

66
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,000
Juggling those two things
is going to be tricky

67
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,280
in terms of tone, and we all know,

68
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,350
Laura, that what is
said in a speech tonight

69
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,990
on Capitol Hill can very
quickly be overturned

70
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,940
with just one Tweet tomorrow morning.

71
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:38,801
- It can indeed.

72
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,420
Katty, is this really laying out

73
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,873
the battle lines for the 2020 election?

74
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,090
- Yeah, I think it is.

75
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,530
There are areas where the president,

76
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,620
and the Republicans, and
the Democrats do agree.

77
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,270
They could do a big
deal on infrastructure,

78
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,320
and I suspect we'll hear
the president reach out

79
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,580
to Democrats on an issue like that.

80
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,700
The trouble is, there is so little trust

81
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,120
on the Democratic side of this president

82
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,870
that, are they willing
to give him some kind

83
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,680
of a deal that he can
then take home and say,

84
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,550
you see, look, I've managed
to achieve something?

85
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,450
The 2020 reelection campaign, in a sense,

86
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,440
is starting right now.

87
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,330
We've already had those
Democratic candidates

88
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,900
who have launched their bids.

89
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,430
They're going to be sitting
right in front of the president.

90
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,440
Tonight is his big audience, also,

91
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,840
to talk about what he's achieved,

92
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,450
and what he can still achieve,

93
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,870
and of course, the spectacle
of all of this crowned

94
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,940
by Nancy Pelosi, Laura,
sitting right behind him,

95
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,440
the Democrat who has just given him

96
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,010
a very tough time, a
tough run for his money,

97
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,810
over that government shutdown.

98
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,950
You're right, the 2020
reelection campaign is all over

99
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,550
this State of the Union Address.

100
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,170
- Katty, what will you be watching for

101
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:46,600
when you see Nancy Pelosi there,

102
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,840
the symbol of divided government,

103
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,240
watching over the president?

104
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,980
- Yeah, I mean, it's almost
a kind of visual reminder

105
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,250
in every shot because, in
these States of the Unions,

106
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,660
you have the president, and then you have

107
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,160
the two people, Mike
Pence and Nancy Pelosi,

108
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,390
sitting behind him, and
they're in almost every shot.

109
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,690
It's almost a visual reminder for people

110
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:08,130
of this new tougher political landscape

111
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,960
that President Trump now faces.

112
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,390
I'd be surprised if
she gives him much more

113
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:15,290
than a cursory round of
applause at the beginning.

114
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,670
The rest of the time, expect her

115
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,040
to sit pretty stone-faced

116
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,340
while Vice President Mike
Pence sits there cheering.

117
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:24,500
That's the kind of prospect
that always comes up

118
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,870
in States of the Unions.

119
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:29,010
Remember, it's not just Nancy
Pelosi sitting behind him.

120
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,080
It's all those newly-elected members

121
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,170
of the Democratic House
of Representatives sitting

122
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,200
in front of him.

123
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,980
This is a very different
State of the Union audience

124
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,533
in that chamber than it
was for him a year ago.

125
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,457
- Katty Kay, thank you.

126
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,210
Well, the State of the Union
Address is a marquee event,

127
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:50,260
a speech which is
rewritten multiple times.

128
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,300
The White House says the
president has been going

129
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,750
through tonight's pages with his Sharpie,

130
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,360
reworking the material.

131
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,160
It's all about striking the right tone

132
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,570
while leaving an impression for the ages.

133
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:03,050
Here are some examples from the past.

134
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,450
- Don't let anyone tell you

135
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:08,340
that America's best days are behind her,

136
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,810
that the American spirit
has been vanquished.

137
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:14,233
- The era of big government is over.

138
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:16,150
(audience claps)

139
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:20,980
- Terrorist allies constitute
an axis of evil arming

140
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,730
to threaten the peace of the world.

141
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,010
- Well, for more on the significance

142
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,930
of these major addresses and the work

143
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,130
that goes into them, I spoke
earlier with Stephen Krupin,

144
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,820
a former speechwriter for President Obama.

145
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:37,890
State of the Union Address is
a highly choreographed one.

146
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,611
Just how high are the expectations

147
00:06:40,611 --> 00:06:42,400
of this speech tonight?

148
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,610
- The White House would like
to set out an expectation

149
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,740
that this is going to be,
as you and Katty mentioned,

150
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,840
a speech about unity, which I think

151
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,240
is just about as credible

152
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,170
as much else coming out
of the Trump White House.

153
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:55,720
The State of the Union Address happens

154
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,553
in the House chamber.

155
00:06:56,553 --> 00:06:57,530
It doesn't happen in a vacuum,

156
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,630
and we can't listen to
what he says tonight

157
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,660
without regard for what he said yesterday

158
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,760
and what he'll say tomorrow.

159
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,590
If the president continues
to stigmatize immigrants,

160
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,387
continues to spurn
allies, how is that unity?

161
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:12,020
If the White House has
to go to such extremes

162
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,680
to make that case that this
is a speech about unity,

163
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,950
if he does that one day a year

164
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,343
using sentences that we
know don't sound the way

165
00:07:18,343 --> 00:07:20,840
that President Trump,
as we all know, sounds,

166
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,960
it kind of gives lie to the whole charade.

167
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,340
- But as a former speechwriter,

168
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,730
just how much work would
go into a speech like this?

169
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:29,900
- An enormous amount of work.

170
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,460
It starts months before the speech itself.

171
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,810
It is a speech

172
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:37,150
where not only the White
House is focused on it,

173
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:40,030
the communications, the
policy, the research parts

174
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:42,490
of the White House, but also
all the cabinet agencies.

175
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,520
Everyone wants their line
in that precious real estate

176
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,510
because, when the president
of the United States says it

177
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,010
to the country and the world,

178
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,290
it elevates their issue.

179
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,650
- [Laura] Also, typically,
these speeches have a big,

180
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,770
historical sweep, don't they?

181
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:58,990
Because the tradition began
with George Washington himself.

182
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:00,270
- [Stephen] It is, it is historical,

183
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,970
and the history of it is
all about accountability.

184
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,900
It is not the president
speaking to the country

185
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,310
and the world from the Oval Office.

186
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,570
It is the president coming
to the people's house

187
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,880
at the invitation of the people's house,

188
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,870
which underscores that our
democracy is about checks

189
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,660
and balances, and that the president,

190
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,990
whether he likes it or not,

191
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,420
needs the Congress to pass his agenda.

192
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,900
- Although we hear from the president,

193
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,140
especially this one, in a variety of ways,

194
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,550
on Twitter, we have
impromptu press conferences,

195
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,610
but as an occasion, do you feel

196
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:31,130
that the State of the
Union retains its power?

197
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:34,710
- I think it retains its
power in a general sense

198
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,190
because it is the president speaking

199
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,840
to all of the government assembled,

200
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,540
as well as the American
people beyond and the world,

201
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,480
who are listening to what he has to say.

202
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,120
In this particular case,

203
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,510
I think it does him a disservice.

204
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,840
I think the State of the
Union Address is perhaps

205
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,360
President Trump's most unnatural venue.

206
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,550
It is, at its best, an
opportunity to call for unity,

207
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,210
which President Trump does not do,

208
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:58,240
he speaks to his base, he is divisive,

209
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,270
is an opportunity to speak the truth,

210
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,220
which we know President Trump doesn't do.

211
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,340
It's an opportunity for
careful rhetoric, and we know

212
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:07,150
that President Trump is careless
at best with his rhetoric.

213
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,660
- We'll see how he does tonight,

214
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,580
but President Ronald Reagan
started this tradition

215
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,790
of mentioning in his speech people

216
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,080
that he had brought as guests.

217
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,780
That's really become quite a
bit of stagecraft, hasn't it?

218
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,020
- It's absolutely stagecraft.

219
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,050
It's an important way to show

220
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:22,720
that the policy that is spoken about

221
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,220
in the State of the Union
Address actually affects

222
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,650
real people, real Americans,

223
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,760
that it's not just
abstract political theory.

224
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,960
What President Obama
tried to do, for example,

225
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,020
was talk about people who
represented the struggles,

226
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,600
or the challenges, or the aspirations

227
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,800
that the American people
were going through.

228
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,800
In 2015, there was a family
named the Erlers from Minnesota

229
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:47,270
whose story of perseverance
was a nice metaphor

230
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,830
for the way the country was coming out

231
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,080
of the Great Recession.

232
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,913
What was different

233
00:09:50,913 --> 00:09:53,660
about the way President
Obama used these guests is,

234
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,410
it spoke to the country's hopes.

235
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,300
President Trump, as we'll see tonight,

236
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,710
just like last year, often uses guests

237
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:03,230
in an exploitative way to
speak to our basest fears.

238
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,820
- [Laura] Stephen Krupin,
we'll see what the speech has

239
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,770
in store for us tonight.

240
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:06,780
Thank you for joining us.

241
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,230
- Thank you, good to be here.

242
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,630
- Now, the actor Liam
Neeson says he's no racist

243
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:15,040
after admitting he once
walked the streets looking

244
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,870
for a black man to kill.

245
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,160
The Hollywood star describes a primal urge

246
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,390
for revenge after a friend was raped

247
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,320
by someone she said was black.

248
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,900
Neeson insists that race had
nothing to do with his actions.

249
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,373
The BBC's Nick Bryant
has more from New York.

250
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,800
- [Nick] After his explosive comments

251
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,210
about rape, revenge, and race--

252
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:38,040
Mr. Neeson, are you
sorry for what you said?

253
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,850
Liam Neeson arrived at this
Manhattan television studio

254
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,740
not to make an apology,

255
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,190
but to offer an explanation.

256
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:46,610
- I'm not racist.

257
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:47,760
- [Nick] He admitted to setting out

258
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,700
to kill an innocent black
man nearly 40 years ago

259
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,420
after someone close to
him was allegedly raped

260
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,360
by a black man.

261
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,456
- Would you have had the same reaction

262
00:10:55,456 --> 00:10:57,060
if your friend had said
it was a white man?

263
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,360
Would you have wanted
to go out and kill him?

264
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,120
- If she'd have said an Irish, or a Scot,

265
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,320
or a Brit, or a Lithuanian,

266
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,350
I know I would've had the same effect.

267
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:10,350
I was trying to show honor to,
stand up for my dear friend

268
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:17,483
in this terrible medieval fashion.

269
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,390
I'm a fairly intelligent guy,

270
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,380
and that's why it kinda shocked me

271
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,690
when I came down to earth

272
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,530
after having these horrible feelings.

273
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:31,530
Luckily, no violence occurred
ever, thanks be to God.

274
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,040
- What makes you think you can kill a man?

275
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,983
- I read it in a crime novel.

276
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,130
Carl's dead.

277
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,380
Tell me what happened.

278
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,600
- [Nick] Promoting his new movie,

279
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,180
the theme of which is murderous revenge,

280
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,860
the actor had given an interview,

281
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,100
telling how he sought retribution

282
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,853
after hearing about the rape.

283
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,270
There's been outrage at those remarks,

284
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:32,670
but some have commended his
honesty, and viewers saw

285
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:36,240
his own personal torment
written across his face.

286
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,250
- Wow, I'm just shocked.

287
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,380
I couldn't believe he would
say something like that.

288
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,650
I thought he was a good guy.

289
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:46,320
- It makes you have a little bit of fear,

290
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,690
but we have to push through that

291
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:48,990
and find the love.

292
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,980
- He was on a public platform.

293
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,830
- [Nick] At this black
theater company in London,

294
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,930
young actors gave us their reaction.

295
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:57,993
- Him using that language in the interview

296
00:12:57,993 --> 00:13:00,710
in light of his influence is naive.

297
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,623
- I agree with you, I don't
think we should vilify him,

298
00:13:02,623 --> 00:13:06,720
but the statement that
he made is problematic.

299
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,230
- For Liam Neeson,
today was supposed to be

300
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,280
about promoting his new movie,

301
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,520
but instead, he's trying
to salvage his reputation.

302
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,120
(reporters shout)

303
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,760
The 66-year-old has been one

304
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,470
of Hollywood's more bankable stars.

305
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:24,620
Will he face a backlash at the box office?

306
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,653
Nick Bryant, BBC News, New York.

307
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,340
- In other news now, high level talks

308
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,630
between Afghan officials

309
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:34,140
and the Taliban are
taking place in Russia.

310
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,610
This comes off the back of the US

311
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:36,770
and the Taliban announcing

312
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:39,630
they made progress in
peace talks last month.

313
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,970
Afghan government officials
who are not taking part

314
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:45,810
in the talks criticize the
meeting as counterproductive.

315
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:47,400
Former Manchester United manager

316
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,120
Jose Mourinho has been sentenced

317
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,960
to a year in prison in
Spain for tax fraud,

318
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,410
but will not serve any time behind bars.

319
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:56,010
He accepted the sentence as part

320
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,820
of a deal with prosecutors

321
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,810
in a wider investigation
into alleged tax evasion

322
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:03,300
by some of Spain's top footballers.

323
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:07,140
Instead, he'll pay a fine
of 1.75 million pounds.

324
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,700
Pope Francis, who's just returned

325
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,320
from a tour of the Middle East, has,

326
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,620
for the first time, publicly admitted

327
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,410
that clerics have sexually abused nuns.

328
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,810
Speaking during a midair news conference,

329
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:19,230
he said the church was aware

330
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:21,830
that priests and bishops had abused nuns,

331
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,600
and was working on the issue.

332
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,850
Pope Francis added that his predecessor,

333
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:28,220
Pope Benedict, was forced to shut down

334
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,310
an entire congregation of nuns

335
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,483
who were being abused by priests.

336
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,380
Police in Paris say the fire

337
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,890
that engulfed a residential
building during the night,

338
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:42,490
killing 10 people, was
possibly started on purpose.

339
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,480
They've arrested a woman who lived there.

340
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,340
At least 30 other people have
been injured in the blaze.

341
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:50,540
Lucy Williamson reports now from Paris.

342
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,600
- [Lucy] The fire brigade
described it as apocalyptic,

343
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,590
an eight-story apartment
block hollowed out by flames,

344
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:02,240
its living rooms, bedrooms,
hallways fuel for the inferno.

345
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,470
Tiny ladders hung from windows,

346
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,263
a lifeline, allowing
firefighters to get in.

347
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:11,250
It was a scene of chaos,
their captain said,

348
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,460
the search for residents

349
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,580
through the smoke-filled
floors accompanied

350
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,163
by the sound of screaming,

351
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:21,113
many survivors found clinging
to windowsills or roofs.

352
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,363
- The alarm went off after midnight.

353
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,870
It was already black with smoke.

354
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,520
I live on the top floor.

355
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,503
I had to climb across
several balconies to get out.

356
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,950
We hid in a corner with several people

357
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,403
to escape the flames.

358
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,360
- By dawn, the fire was under control,

359
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,623
but the search for victims continued.

360
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:52,360
When firemen arrived here in
the early hours this morning,

361
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,330
they found a building
hidden behind a courtyard.

362
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,840
With no way of accessing
it from the street,

363
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,860
their normal ladders were useless.

364
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,640
They had to use specialist equipment

365
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,003
to rescue people from
windows and nearby roofs.

366
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,870
Police are treating it as arson,

367
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,420
and are questioning a resident.

368
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:15,020
- A woman who lives in the
building has been questioned.

369
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,600
She is 40 years old and
has a previous history

370
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,123
of psychiatric disorders.

371
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,240
- [Lucy] Firefighters are working

372
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,070
to stabilize the building and
find the source of the blaze,

373
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,650
this sedate corner of
Paris now a crime scene,

374
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:34,810
a barren shell burnt bare of family life.

375
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,113
Lucy Williamson, BBC News, Paris.

376
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,330
- So many questions after that
devastating fire in Paris.

377
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:44,730
You're watching BBC World New America.

378
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,980
Still to come on tonight's program,

379
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,130
in Brazil, tales of survival
and devastating loss

380
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,300
following a major dam collapse.

381
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,363
The search for the missing continues.

382
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,803
(intense electronic music)

383
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:04,890
The UK music chain HMV,
which collapsed in December,

384
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,800
has been saved by a
Canadian record company.

385
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,120
Sunrise Records says
HMV has a bright future,

386
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,920
but it will close the flagship
store in central London.

387
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,560
The new owners say they'll be listening

388
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,090
to what their customers want,

389
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:20,720
including a greater
selection of vinyl records.

390
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,083
Here's Lee Zomazimba.

391
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,490
- [Narrator] Lunchtime, a quick stampede

392
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:25,970
to the record shops.

393
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,850
- [Lee] For decades, HMV stores have been

394
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:30,370
a huge part of life for music fans,

395
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:33,270
and for some of music's biggest artists.

396
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,432
- [Woman] Hello, Davy.

397
00:17:34,432 --> 00:17:35,731
♪ We will remember ♪

398
00:17:35,731 --> 00:17:38,640
(crowd cheers)

399
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,130
- [Lee] Now, while 100
stores have been saved,

400
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:43,090
27 are being shut down,

401
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,100
including the one where it all started

402
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,980
almost 100 years ago on
London's Oxford Street,

403
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,710
a perhaps inevitable consequence

404
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:53,410
of a music-loving public
who still enjoy shopping

405
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:57,323
in person, but who also
embrace consuming music online.

406
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,130
- People are ordering
online, they're streaming,

407
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:02,700
and really, there's
still a crowd of people

408
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,560
who want to come and browse.

409
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,010
- We rely on so many other things now,

410
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:09,940
streaming music, we stream
TV, we stream films,

411
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,150
and they've gotta find a business model

412
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,240
so they can survive.

413
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,430
- We get amazing support.

414
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,760
- [Lee] Enter Doug Putman,

415
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,770
owner of Canadian
retailer Sunrise Records,

416
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,920
HMV's new owners.

417
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:25,560
- We took over 80-some
odd stores in Canada

418
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,970
almost two and a half years ago,

419
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:31,673
and they're doing strong,
doing well, profitable.

420
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:37,560
We see HMV continuing on
in the UK for a long time.

421
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,880
- The challenges are significant.

422
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,300
HMV once made its money from huge sales

423
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,510
of CDs and games, all of
which have been plummeting

424
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:48,550
year on year, but even though many stores,

425
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:51,710
including, perhaps, this one,
their flagship, are closing,

426
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:54,640
they are still confident
that HMV can exist

427
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,070
up and down the country

428
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:59,960
through to its centenary
in 2021 and beyond.

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,223
(intense electronic music)

431
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,080
- In Brazil, the search continues

432
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,950
for those still missing after the collapse

433
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,320
of a major dam.

434
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,510
The death toll stands at 134,

435
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:23,560
with nearly 200 others unaccounted for

436
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,410
after an avalanche of
liquid mining waste swept

437
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:28,140
through the countryside.

438
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,720
Our South America correspondent
Katy Watson has been

439
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,550
to the site of the disaster

440
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:35,590
to speak to a woman who lost
six members of her family

441
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:38,873
and to a survivor who had
the narrowest of escapes.

442
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:43,180
- When the dam broke,
there was little hope

443
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:46,230
for those in the path of
the deluge that followed.

444
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:50,152
Panic as drivers struggle
to save themselves.

445
00:19:50,152 --> 00:19:53,240
(Elias speaks in foreign language)

446
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,747
Elias was driving one
of the trucks that day.

447
00:19:55,747 --> 00:19:58,490
"It sounded like an
explosion," he tells me,

448
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,653
but he soon realized what had happened.

449
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:04,500
- We saw the mud coming,

450
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,600
and I told my friend Sebastian,
run, the dam has burst.

451
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,710
You can see it on video, my truck moving

452
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,580
from one side to the other.

453
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,180
There was no way out.

454
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,060
We asked God to protect us.

455
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:18,070
Death was staring us in the face.

456
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,220
- They survived.

457
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,120
This was the aftermath.

458
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,370
His pickup, says Elias,

459
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:25,743
was like a grain of sand
tossed about in the chaos.

460
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,230
I meet Vanderlei searching

461
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:32,000
for the bodies of his brother
and cousin in the sludge.

462
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,743
This is their overturned truck.

463
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,177
- My world's ended.

464
00:20:38,177 --> 00:20:40,167
I know I wouldn't find them alive here,

465
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:42,760
but if we are not on top of the search,

466
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,460
the authorities will stop looking.

467
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,030
- But in this sludge, the
recovery effort is slow.

468
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,930
There's been lots of rain
here in the past 24 hours,

469
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:55,420
and these firefighters
are returning to areas,

470
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,710
hoping that, with the extra water,

471
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:58,100
it might've displaced the mud,

472
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,001
and they can recover more bodies.

473
00:21:00,001 --> 00:21:02,530
(helicopter whirs)

474
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,980
Every so often, they find something.

475
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,023
A body bag is flown back
to waiting families.

476
00:21:10,726 --> 00:21:13,120
(Helena sobs)

477
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,220
The events of this past
week are still hard

478
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,760
to process for Helena.

479
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,630
She was to become a grandmother.

480
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:21,033
When the dam collapsed, that dream ended.

481
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:26,250
Her daughter, son, and pregnant
daughter-in-law were killed

482
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,990
when a wall of sludge slammed

483
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,220
into the hotel they were staying in.

484
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:33,033
Her ex-husband and his
wife died with them.

485
00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:36,670
- [Helena] Camilla, Luis.

486
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,020
- Helena spells out the initials

487
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:41,010
of Camilla, Luis, his partner Fernanda,

488
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:42,713
and unborn baby Lorenzo.

489
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,990
- They were thrown I don't know where.

490
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:53,260
They died from cranial
trauma and asphyxia.

491
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,580
That was the coroner's verdict.

492
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,110
I don't even know if it was a slow

493
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,073
or a quick death.

494
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,390
- [Katy] The family's mourning
is made all the harder

495
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:05,690
because they haven't
found all the bodies yet.

496
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,420
In the distance, the search goes on.

497
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:12,120
Katy Watson, BBC News in Brumadinho.

498
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:16,830
- So much loss and grief there in Brazil.

499
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:19,360
Now, Sir Don McCullin has
trained his camera lens

500
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,680
on the horrors of war around the world.

501
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,060
His images from Vietnam won him awards

502
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,290
and respect in equal measure,

503
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:28,290
and even though he's now in his 80s,

504
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:31,240
the photographer has been
to Syria and to Yemen.

505
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,850
He's also photographed
inequality in his native Britain.

506
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:37,850
Now his classic images
are on display in London.

507
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:40,063
The BBC's Tim Muffett went to meet him.

508
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,030
- [Tim] Life and death

509
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:47,713
as captured by Don McCullin.

510
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,260
- Everything about me has
been very instinctive,

511
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:57,070
this knowing that I should be
in this place and that place.

512
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,750
- This exhibition brings together more

513
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,470
than 250 photographs by one

514
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:03,683
of the world's greatest photographers.

515
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,750
- This photograph is, you could say,

516
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:10,400
the beginning of my whole
life's work, really.

517
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,320
I started photographing the local boys

518
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,510
who I used to hang out with.

519
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,460
None of us were going anywhere in life.

520
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:19,910
This photograph was the very first picture

521
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,310
I ever took in war.

522
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:24,670
- This was the Cypriot Civil War, 1964.

523
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,100
- With the raincoat and the hat,

524
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,970
it looks like a still
from some mafioso film.

525
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:30,170
- [Tim] Were you scared?

526
00:23:31,025 --> 00:23:32,760
- No, I was too excited to be scared.

527
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,833
I was scared of not getting pictures.

528
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:38,000
- [Tim] His reputation growing rapidly,

529
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,670
Don McCullin's assignments took him

530
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:41,650
to war zones across the world.

531
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,090
- That's the camera that
got the bullet on this.

532
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,120
Right, see it?

533
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:44,953
- [Tim] My goodness.

534
00:23:44,953 --> 00:23:46,010
- [Don] That was in Cambodia.

535
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,770
- What makes a great photograph,

536
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:48,780
as far as you're concerned?

537
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,663
- [Don] First of all, it has impact.

538
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,800
I do not want you to walk past my pictures

539
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,980
without getting some message from it.

540
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:00,130
- [Tim] As well as war zones far away,

541
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:01,870
Don McCullin's also focused

542
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:05,260
on conflict and
depravation closer to home.

543
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,890
These pictures are all black and white.

544
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:07,960
Why is that?

545
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,150
- [Don] Because I think
black and white has

546
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:15,150
a much stronger way of
voicing itself to you.

547
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,830
It's a silent voice,

548
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:20,810
but I want it to be a
shouting silent voice

549
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:22,050
so you don't miss it.

550
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:25,110
- Some photographers bemoan
the ubiquity of camera phones.

551
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:27,240
It's so easy to take a digital photograph.

552
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,073
What do you think?

553
00:24:28,073 --> 00:24:30,160
- People are now realizing that they want

554
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,810
to record their lives.

555
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:36,140
In a way, it's kind of enhancing
the love of photography.

556
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,940
Went to Vietnam two or three times,

557
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,870
but it wasn't until 1968

558
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:43,480
did I come up against a real opportunity

559
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,733
to stay in a battle for nearly two weeks.

560
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:50,590
This picture here, I
call it my crucifixion.

561
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,050
I put my cameras down.

562
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:53,970
I said to one of the
soldiers, "Look after these."

563
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:56,010
I had him on my shoulders, and I ran away.

564
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:57,340
I was 31 years old,

565
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,080
and I was strong as a lion, you know.

566
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,530
I could do it.

567
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:03,600
- [Tim] This image captured
post-traumatic stress disorder

568
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,070
long before the condition
was officially acknowledged.

569
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:09,110
- He was shell shocked.

570
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,130
They had no time.

571
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:13,540
The Marines don't respect
people who don't fight,

572
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:17,430
so they were treating him
very shabbily, really.

573
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:19,423
What we call the 1,000-yard stare.

574
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:25,360
Everything I've done in this room

575
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,860
is not gonna change the world.

576
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:29,540
It's just an attempt to show people

577
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,977
that it's wrong, that's all.

578
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:35,780
- Don McCullin's images of war.

579
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,850
Before we go, we want to wish everyone

580
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:40,990
a healthy and prosperous year of the pig.

581
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:43,280
After all, it's Chinese New Year.

582
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,540
The country's state broadcaster put on

583
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,730
its annual extravaganza.

584
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:50,960
An estimated 700 million people tune in

585
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,360
to this event every single year.

586
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,400
The holiday is marked by fireworks,

587
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,610
and by dancing, and by the exchange

588
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:00,260
of red packets filled with money.

589
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,570
Hundreds of millions
of people hit the road

590
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:04,130
to visit loved ones,

591
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:07,980
making it the largest annual
migration in the world.

592
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,720
Happy year of the pig.

593
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,160

624
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,069
by KCET Los Angeles.

625

(soft piano music)

626
00:27:30,019 --> 00:27:30,852
(lively rock music)

627
00:27:30,852 --> 00:27:33,310
- I've always wanted to
know where we came from.

628
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,700
- [Announcer] On Finding Your Roots,

629
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,909
talk show host Michael Strahan.

630
00:27:36,909 --> 00:27:38,250
- Unreal.

631
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,360
- [Announcer] Actor S. Epatha Merkerson.

632
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,550
- I'm blown away.

633
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,383
- [Announcer] History.

634
00:27:42,383 --> 00:27:44,390
- You're looking at the
names of your family.

635
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,940
- [Announcer] Severed by slavery.

636
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,950
- It's unfathomable.

637
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,280
- They have names.

638
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,560
- [Announcer] Ancestry restored.

639
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,184
- Holy.

640
00:27:51,184 --> 00:27:52,017
- Isn't that amazing?

641
00:27:52,017 --> 00:27:53,590

Here, prey are fierce,

of all, your competition.

To succeed, you need family, a pack

where the bonds of love
and loyalty are strong,

660

661

It's an invitation to help somebody know

667
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:58,810
love is at the root of everything,

668
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:00,530
love or the lack of it.
