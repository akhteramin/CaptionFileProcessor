1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:03,230
- Well thanks so much to
you for joining us today,

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:04,063
I'm Jim Sciutto.

3
00:00:04,063 --> 00:00:06,270
You can follow me on Twitter @JimSciutto.

4
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,430
At This Hour With Kate Bolduan

5
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:09,543
starts right now.

6
00:00:10,472 --> 00:00:13,222
(dramatic music)

7
00:00:23,505 --> 00:00:25,610
(dramatic music)

8
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,050
- Hello everyone, I'm Kate Boldaun.

9
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:28,500
Thanks so much for joining me.

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,880
A ticking time bomb, that is
what federal investigators warn

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,340
in a new report about the
dangerous overcrowding

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,860
occurring in government border facilities.

13
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,360
A government report,
not an advocacy group,

14
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,220
not Democratic members of Congress,

15
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,640
not attorneys representing migrants,

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,290
this is a 16 page report
compiled by the Inspector General

17
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,690
of the Department of Homeland Security.

18
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:51,740
Look at these images

19
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,120
that we're showing right here.

20
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,680
What they found is shocking.

21
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,860
Mass overcrowding of children and adults,

22
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,900
some with no access to
showers or clean clothes.

23
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,080
No laundry facilities.

24
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,560
It's all detailed in the report.

25
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,350
Some children with no access
to warm meals for days.

26
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,560
Adults forced into standing
room only conditions

27
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,400
for a week, the report says.

28
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,000
Officials describe the migrants

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,740
even as banging on cell windows

30
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:19,180
and holding up signs for help.

31
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,023
And then there are these images.

32
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,570
These are images drawn by children

33
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,690
who recently were released
from border facilities.

34
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,695
The drawings appear to show children,

35
00:01:29,695 --> 00:01:32,300
you know exactly what your eyes tell you.

36
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,390
In cages, in jail.

37
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:35,920
The American Academy of Pediatrics

38
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,200
released these pictures,
saying that these facilities,

39
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,680
in their words, are no place for children.

40
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,000
It's a painful reminder
of what these children

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,750
are going through and are
going through right now.

42
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,210
Let's get straight over
to CNN's Nick Valencia.

43
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,710
He's at a border facility
in El Paso, Texas.

44
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,393
Nick, what's the very latest?

45
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,460
- Well, it's a bit of
breaking news this morning.

46
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,410
We're hearing from acting DHS
secretary, Kevin McAleenan

47
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,150
about those social media posts.

48
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,270
Remember earlier this week Kate

49
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,610
we reported, ProPublica,
the investigative team

50
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:07,860
first reported about this
closed Facebook group

51
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,230
that featured current

52
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,720
and former they say, Border Patrol agents

53
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,890
making lewd comments, derogatory comments,

54
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,390
racially inflammatory comments,

55
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,970
joking about dead migrants.

56
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,470
Well, now Kevin McAleenan
the acting DHS secretary

57
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,927
tweeting this this morning.

58
00:02:20,927 --> 00:02:23,377
"I have directed an
immediate investigation,

59
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:25,647
"and as the U.S. Border
Patrol Cheif has made clear,

60
00:02:25,647 --> 00:02:27,937
"any employee found to have
compromised the public's trust

61
00:02:27,937 --> 00:02:30,750
"in our law enforcement mission
will be held accountable."

62
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,540
What is a little bit unclear
to us at this moment is

63
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,010
we were under the understanding
that earlier this week

64
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:39,120
an investigation had
already been under way.

65
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,530
The posts were said to have
been turned over to the

66
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,560
Internal Affairs at CBP, DHS.

67
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,250
Inspector General has also said to have

68
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,660
gotten their hands on
these social media posts.

69
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,270
A broader question though Kate,

70
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,900
we're also wondering if he's calling

71
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,120
for an investigation into
these social media posts?

72
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,510
When will he call for an
investigation into the conditions

73
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,910
in these Border Patrol facilities?

74
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,550
And speaking on that, it was yesterday

75
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,390
that I spoke to a long time veteran

76
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,580
El Paso Border Patrol agent who said

77
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,680
that they are just tired
of seeing the conditions

78
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,600
that migrants are being held
in and decided to speak out.

79
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,343
So long as we concealed their identity.

80
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,000
You're taking a big risk by doing this.

81
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,420
- [Agent] Yes, but America needs to know.

82
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,660
They need to know the truth.

83
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,010
- [Nick] A Border Patrol
agent who's had enough.

84
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,550
In a CNN exclusive interview,

85
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,880
the veteran agent who
agreed to go on camera

86
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,010
only if their identity was
concealed, expressed disgust

87
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,150
at a closed Facebook group
reportedly comprised of thousands

88
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,550
of current and former agents.

89
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,768
ProPublica the first to expose the group,

90
00:03:36,768 --> 00:03:40,910
I'm 10-15, where members
shared lewd and sexist content

91
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,460
about Latina members of congress including

92
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,670
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

93
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,600
The agent telling CNN being derogatory is

94
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,260
part of the Border Patrol culture,

95
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,510
even hearing a supervisor
joke about dead migrants.

96
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,750
- [Agent] He was making fun of them.

97
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,583
- Saying what?

98
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:59,300
- [Agent] That, what
difference does it make,

99
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,453
it's just another life.

100
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:07,780
He made a comment also
regarding running over illegals

101
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:10,630
and I'm like, you cannot run over people.

102
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,790
- [Nick] In describing the conditions

103
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,080
inside the El Paso detention facilities,

104
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,540
the agent compared them to a zoo.

105
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,230
- [Agent] The holding facility, the cells,

106
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:24,083
they are, what I would say, filthy.

107
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:28,570
We have a maintenance and cleaning crew

108
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:33,110
that clean the general
area, like the hallways,

109
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,463
but I have never seen
them cleaning pampers,

110
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:41,170
or cleaning toilets in the cells

111
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,453
or cleaning sinks in the cell.

112
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,330
Sometimes you go in a cell
and there is trash everywhere.

113
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,390
- There are those in leadership

114
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:55,150
in Customs and Border Protection,

115
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:55,983
- [Agent] Yes.

116
00:04:55,983 --> 00:04:57,430
- [Nick] They say, that
migrants are getting

117
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,410
basic human rights.

118
00:04:58,410 --> 00:04:59,730
What do you say to leaders who are saying,

119
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:02,080
migrants are getting basic human rights?

120
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,150
- [Agent] What is basic human rights?

121
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,193
Toilet paper?

122
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,623
Water from the sink?

123
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:13,550
Wearing the same clothing for days?

124
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,930
I remember when there used
to be a processing center,

125
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,870
where we used to have,
especially in winter,

126
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,553
we used to have these blankets,

127
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:24,230
and 10 different aliens
would use the same blanket.

128
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,091
We would recycle them.

129
00:05:26,091 --> 00:05:31,091
We'd put them in a bag and
they wouldn't get wash.

130
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,950
- I feel like, you know, multiple
times during our interview

131
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,730
you've sort of stared off in the distance

132
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,000
and you've thought about
some things that you've seen.

133
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It seems as though there are things

134
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,830
that you might take home with you.

135
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:43,663
- [Agent] Everyday.

136
00:05:43,663 --> 00:05:44,496
- Like what?

137
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:46,900
- [Agent] The kids.

138
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,810
- [Nick] What about the kids?

139
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,630
- [Agent] You know, they just want hope.

140
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,463
They want to believe in something.

141
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,770
They want to feel sure.

142
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:59,570
- Do you support President
Trump's immigration policies?

143
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:04,480
- [Agent] President Trump
is our Commander-in-chief,

144
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,030
and unless he's unethical, illegal,

145
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:10,210
or immoral we should obey.

146
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:12,463
- [Nick] The question is, at what cost?

147
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,030
Customs and Border Protection
did not directly respond

148
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,420
to those allegations, Kate,

149
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,570
but they did say that
they're handing them over

150
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:23,130
to the Office of the Inspector General.

151
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,060
- Nick, thanks so much.

152
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,290
Really great reporting down
there, really appreciate it.

153
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,440
Joining me right now,
to discuss this further,

154
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,870
is Congressman Marc Veasey of Texas.

155
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,310
He was among the Democratic
lawmakers who visited

156
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,230
some of the border detention facilities

157
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,550
in his state this week.

158
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:38,920
Congressman, I was just
seeing you shaking your head.

159
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,753
- Yeah, I mean, just hearing that, I mean,

160
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,290
how can you hear that and it
not just break your heart?

161
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,610
I mean, it's awful.

162
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:53,630
And based on what I saw, on
my trip, day before yesterday,

163
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,810
I 100% believe him.

164
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,360
They did everything they could

165
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,994
to give us the there's
nothing here to see tour,

166
00:06:59,994 --> 00:07:04,440
but when you talked to
migrants that were in custody,

167
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,840
they told us first hand
that they were being told

168
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,500
to drink out of toilets
when they were thirsty,

169
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,730
that there were kids that were
walking around in clothing

170
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:19,440
where there was mucus just from
days and days worth of mucus

171
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,730
and other debris on their clothing.

172
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:26,700
Showers being denied for days.

173
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,910
They told us that they
could shower anytime,

174
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:29,770
at least once a day,

175
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,240
but what we were told was

176
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,420
that they were being denied
showers for days by migrants,

177
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,980
and you know, based on this Facebook post,

178
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:42,410
how can you not believe that
the migrants were telling us

179
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:45,780
the truth, and now based on
what this Border Patrol agent

180
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,850
was just telling us and the IG report,

181
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,270
I mean, something has to change.

182
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,350
- Well, let's talk about
that, but before we get there,

183
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,080
on top of those two things,

184
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,570
there's something else that
has come out, these images,

185
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:01,190
these drawings from the
American Academy of Pediatrics.

186
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,980
They released these pictures of drawings

187
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,380
that young children made
once they were released,

188
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,780
but made of their time in custody.

189
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,840
I mean, you can see with your own eyes,

190
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,170
what it clearly looked like
to them and more importantly,

191
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:19,150
what it felt like to them to be in there.

192
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,123
What do you say to that when you see this?

193
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:25,620
- Yeah, well, I can't see the images,

194
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:30,620
but I can tell you that we saw
young children that appeared

195
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,350
to me to be three or four years old

196
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:34,670
that were in holding cells.

197
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,320
Holding cells similar
to what you would see

198
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,793
at a county lock-up.

199
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:42,690
And again, just based on the IG's report

200
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:45,753
and the interviews that we just heard,

201
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,480
there's no question in my
mind that these children

202
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,620
are being treated very poorly

203
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:56,670
and I think that it also
illustrates that President Trump

204
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:00,530
will do anything that he can
to try to appease his base

205
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,220
when it comes to immigration

206
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,450
and that he is using this migrants,

207
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,140
as pawns in a political game

208
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,760
and that is just absolutely
sick and it has to stop now.

209
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,260
And I will tell you that one of the things

210
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,270
that has to change today
is that members of Congress

211
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,680
need to be able to go and
visit these facilities

212
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,810
without 48 hour notice.

213
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,170
Right now, we have to give 48 hour notice.

214
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:25,030
We need to be able to
go into these facilities

215
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,520
whenever we want to

216
00:09:27,756 --> 00:09:30,270
and we can fly down there on our own dime,

217
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,310
we can fly down there at
the spur of the moment--

218
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,340
- I actually have been wondering
about this, Congressman.

219
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,640
- When we hear about this allegations.

220
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,783
- It's really interesting
actually that you bring this up

221
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:38,060
because I've been wondering this.

222
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:41,050
Coming from the IG report,
where they did surprise visits

223
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,880
at five facilities and
that's what they found.

224
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,960
And even with the amount of
notice that you were given,

225
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,130
that you had to give to
go into this facility,

226
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,910
and the stories that you were told,

227
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:52,720
I'm starting to wonder if you just,

228
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,630
because journalists can't
go in there with cameras,

229
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:58,860
that's the thing I continue
to have to say to our viewers.

230
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,840
Why don't you just make a tour of it,

231
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,000
why don't you just give
that 48 hours notice

232
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,880
and make a tour of it

233
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,810
and keep visiting these
facilities over and over again

234
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:10,250
because maybe that is
what would bring about,

235
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,053
maybe that is what would
bring about change?

236
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:18,150
- Yeah, I think that again,

237
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,440
obviously more tours would be helpful,

238
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,530
but not having to give the notice.

239
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:25,460
I mean, if I wanted to
go down there right now

240
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,180
and visit that facility at Clint,

241
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,620
or any of them along the border,

242
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,420
I need to be able to,
as a member of Congress,

243
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,640
we have oversight of these committees,

244
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,810
and the game that they're playing.

245
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,660
And I personally feel like the reason

246
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,360
why they're playing games
is that they feel empowered

247
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,870
by this president and Stephen Miller,

248
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:44,460
who's his so-called immigration tzar.

249
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,560
- But you do have someone

250
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,810
appointed by the President
as well, the new Acting Chief

251
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,090
of the Department of Homeland Security,

252
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:51,370
who he says he's acting,

253
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,970
in talking about the Facebook postings,

254
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,300
that secret Facebook page.

255
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,280
He's directed an investigation

256
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,420
and he says that anyone
who's done wrong should be

257
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,720
and will be held accountable.

258
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,070
We learned that today.

259
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,083
Do you applaud him?

260
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,030
- Yeah, no absolutely.

261
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,470
He is certainly saying the right thing

262
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,470
when it comes to that.

263
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:11,260
We need to see it followed up with action.

264
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,510
Of course, you probably
saw that Elijah Cummings,

265
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,950
who's the Chair of the
Oversight Committee,

266
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:17,500
that he's going to conduct investigations,

267
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,690
that the acting secretary
said that he is going

268
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:21,637
to conduct investigations.

269
00:11:21,637 --> 00:11:24,210
And not only do people
need to be disciplined,

270
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,760
people need to be fired.

271
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,000
I mean, I can't tell
you, Kate, just the fact,

272
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,320
knowing that some of the
people that were supposed to be

273
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,830
our security for that day,

274
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:39,430
when we were at the press
conference, and all of the people

275
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:40,420
that were wearing the MAGA hats

276
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,400
were screaming obscenities at us,

277
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,030
that those were supposed to
be our security personnel

278
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:48,490
and those are the people that
are supposed to be in charge

279
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:51,640
of making sure these migrants
are being treated humanely,

280
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,920
and they're a part of that Facebook page.

281
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,410
That's just absolutely unacceptable.

282
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:00,900
So, when investigations are conducted,

283
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,100
and I hope that they will
be conducted very swiftly,

284
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,740
people need to be terminated and, again,

285
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,610
depending on what is found out,

286
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:10,890
there may need to be some people
that need to be prosecuted.

287
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,460
- Well, one thing that we do know,

288
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,293
is there's something like

289
00:12:14,293 --> 00:12:17,040
9500 members of that Facebook page,

290
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,490
but we don't know exactly

291
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:22,150
who those Facebook pages,
who those postings are from,

292
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,540
who those people are in real life,

293
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,950
that is part of the investigation

294
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,700
and that is what Kevin McAleenan says

295
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,533
they're gonna get to the bottom of.

296
00:12:27,533 --> 00:12:29,340
There's so much more to this,

297
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,800
especially from this IG report.

298
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,750
I just cannot turn away from
it and no one else should.

299
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,650
Congressman, thank you comin' on.

300
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:37,865
Let us know when you go on your next tour.

301
00:12:37,865 --> 00:12:39,170
- Absolutely.

302
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,003
- We have another story, though,

303
00:12:40,003 --> 00:12:41,150
that we're following this morning.

304
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:44,270
CNN has learned that
military chiefs have concerns

305
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:46,970
over what President Trump's
Fourth of July event

306
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,160
is turning into.

307
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,030
A source with direct knowledge says

308
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,650
that while planning the event,

309
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,280
Pentagon leaders expressed reservations

310
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,250
about putting military hardware,

311
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,060
like tanks and other armored
vehicles, on display.

312
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,310
Those concerns, I mean,

313
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,200
they don't appear to have
had much of an impact

314
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,870
as we know, tanks are
already on the National Mall

315
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:05,703
as of this morning.

316
00:13:05,703 --> 00:13:08,290
So, what's this all going to cost?

317
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,140
That is also unclear.

318
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,420
CNN's Tom Foreman, he's in Washington,

319
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,933
at the National Mall for us.

320
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,770
- Hey Kate, preparations
are underway all up and down

321
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:19,790
the National Mall here

322
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:22,510
where things like this big
pieces of military hardware

323
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,870
are being brought in as
the President has requested

324
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:28,740
to have a great show of
American power and influence.

325
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,270
But his critics are saying
what this really is all about

326
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,663
is a great show of his ego.

327
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:39,160
The iconic fireworks
over the National Mall

328
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,190
will be moved to a new spot.

329
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,690
All flights will be grounded

330
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,560
at Washington's Reagan National Airport

331
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,410
for more than two hours

332
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:49,910
and three times the usual
number of National Guard troops

333
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,990
will be deployed for security.

334
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:54,930
All so President Donald
Trump can be the centerpiece

335
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:57,830
for DC's Fourth of July celebration,

336
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:01,120
giving an unprecedented speech
at the Lincoln Memorial.

337
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,840
- We're gonna have a great
Fourth of July in Washington DC.

338
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,083
It'll be like no other.

339
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,750
- [Tom] For all the costly changes,

340
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,770
it's still not precisely
what he wanted early on,

341
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:13,970
a grand military parade, as
seen in other some countries,

342
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:16,760
such as France, Russia, and North Korea,

343
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,560
but cost estimates for
that plan quickly ran into

344
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,770
tens of millions of dollars.

345
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:24,930
The DC City Council, mindful
of expensive street damage

346
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,950
howled, "No tanks".

347
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,600
The Park Service has remained quiet

348
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,210
about how much it will cost to take on

349
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,720
the additional requirements.

350
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,320
And the Pentagon is not
discussing the price tag

351
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,390
for a flyover by the Blue Angels,

352
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,330
a plane that serves as Air Force One,

353
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,800
some other aircraft,

354
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,620
and a couple of tanks and troop carriers

355
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:46,080
that will also be there, but
simply parked near the Mall.

356
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,010
- We wanna bring millions
of people into the city

357
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:53,020
and we want people to
come who love our country!

358
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,150
Those are the people we want.

359
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,287
- [Tom] The President tweeting,

360
00:14:56,287 --> 00:14:59,900
"The Pentagon and our great
Military Leaders are thrilled,"

361
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,700
after asking the chiefs of every branch

362
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,930
to stand with him during the celebration.

363
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:07,113
The Pentagon, not saying
which, if any, are going.

364
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:10,210
And adding to the frustration of those

365
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,930
who claim the traditionally
non-partisan event

366
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:16,140
is being hijacked by Team
Trump, the White House,

367
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,890
and the Republican National Committee,

368
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:20,360
are reportedly giving VIP access

369
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,710
to favored friends and colleagues.

370
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:25,010
Democrats say on this scorching week,

371
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:27,360
they are largely being frozen out.

372
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,660
The White House response.

373
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,860
- This is a public event,
it's open to the public.

374
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,920
- One part of the public I don't
think they're going to like

375
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,180
too much, Kate, is protestors
have received a permit

376
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:40,340
to fly that baby Trump
balloon over everything.

377
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,930
So that will also be up in the air here,

378
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:45,310
no doubt to the displeasure
of the White House.

379
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,330
Kate.

380
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,330
- Tom, thank you so much.

381
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,660
So, it is of course the Fourth
of July as we're discussing,

382
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,840
and we are of course in the
middle of an election season

383
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,930
so you know what that means.

384
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,600
All roads lead to Iowa!

385
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,280
At least for almost everyone.

386
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,410
Most of the top Democratic
presidential contenders

387
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,600
converging on the state right now,

388
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,580
what does that look like on the ground?

389
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,570
And what are Iowa caucus goers,

390
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,182
what are they talkin' about right now?

391
00:16:07,182 --> 00:16:09,849
(intense music)

392
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,740
- My experience with
USAA has been excellent.

393
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,570
They really appreciate military families

394
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:16,750
and it really shows.

395
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,360
- With all that USAA offers,

396
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,520
why go with anybody else?

397
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,860
We know their rates are good.

398
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,740
We know that they're always
gonna take care of us.

399
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,840
- It was instant savings

400
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,550
and I should have changed a long time ago.

401
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,060
- It was funny because when we would call,

402
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,120
another insurance company they would say,

403
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,610
Oh we can't beat USAA.

404
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:31,732
- We're the Weber family.

405
00:16:31,732 --> 00:16:32,620
- We're the Tenney's.

406
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,243
- We're the Hail's and
we're USAA members for life.

- [Announcer] Prestige creams
not living up to the hype?

409
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,620
Olay Regenerist shatters the competition.

410
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,610
Big hype, big price, big deal.

411
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:51,220
Olay Regenerist, hydrates
skin better than creams

412
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,142
costing over 100, 200, and even $400.

413
00:16:54,142 --> 00:16:56,150
(upbeat music)

414
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:59,000
For skin that looks
younger than it should.

415
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Fact check this ad in Good Housekeeping.

416
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:04,230
Olay Regenerist.

417
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:06,400
Now, try Olay Hydrating Eye.

418
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,150
Hydrates better than the
number one prestige eye cream.

419
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,010
- [Man] With my Hepatitis C,

420
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:14,670
I felt I couldn't be at
my best for my family.

421
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:17,590
In only eight weeks with
Mavyret, I was cured,

422
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,510
and left those doubts behind.

423
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:22,800
- [Woman] I faced reminders
of my Hep C everyday,

424
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,380
but in only eight weeks
with Mavyret, I was cured.

425
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,643
- [Man] Even hanging with friends

426
00:17:27,643 --> 00:17:29,100
I was worried about my Hep C,

427
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,830
but in only eight weeks
with Mavyret, I was cured.

428
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,820
- [Announcer] Mavyret is
the only eight-week cure

429
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,760
for all common types of Hep C.

430
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,760
Before starting Mavyret,

431
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,980
your doctor will test if
you'd had Hepatitis B,

432
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,220
which may flare up and
cause serious liver problems

433
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,510
during and after treatment.

434
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,610
Tell your doctor if
you've had Hepatitis B,

435
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:47,150
a liver or kidney transplant,
other liver problems,

436
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,460
HIV 1, or other medical conditions,

437
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,970
and all medicines you take,
including herbal supplements.

438
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,420
Don't take Mavyret with
Atazanavir or rifampin

439
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,130
or if you've had certain liver problems.

440
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:59,380
Common side effects include
headache and tiredness.

441
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:02,220
- With Hep C behind me, I feel free.

442
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,690
- Fearless.

443
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:06,343
- And there's no looking
back because I am cured.

444
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,610
- [Announcer] Talk to
your doctor about Mavyret.

(dramatic music)

447
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,933
That a speaker is just a speaker.

448
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,563
Or that the journey
can't be the destination.

449
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,950
Most people haven't driven a Lincoln.

- We found the perfect new home
and we wanted to move fast,

456
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,100
but we didn't feel
confident making an offer

457
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,560
until we knew our other home would sell.

- If you're running for president,

514
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,260
there are some general rules of the road,

515
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,290
and this is in no way a complete list.

516
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:06,250
You need get used to
shakin' hands, lots of 'em,

517
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,660
you need to get used to
kissing really cute babies,

518
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,960
and you better get
yourself to Iowa if it is

519
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,200
the Fourth of July.

520
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,840
Seven candidates are campaigning
across the state today,

521
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,980
including four of the five
top tier in the latest polling

522
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,813
out of Iowa.

523
00:21:19,813 --> 00:21:21,680
All crisscrossing the
state to make their pitch,

524
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,220
capitalize on their debate bounce,

525
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,950
or make up ground for their
recent drop-off if you will.

526
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:27,783
So, let's go there.

527
00:21:27,783 --> 00:21:29,590
Joining me right now is
Chief Politics Reporter

528
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,800
for the Des Moines Register,
Brianne Pfannenstiel

529
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,690
Brianne, thanks for being here.

530
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:34,850
- Thanks for having me.

531
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:37,230
- So the latest polling
numbers we have out of Iowa

532
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:40,240
really show that the race has reset.

533
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,640
We've got Kamala Harris
seeing a big bounce,

534
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,950
launching into second place,

535
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,980
Biden in the front still

536
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,680
but seeing a real slide in support.

537
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,370
What are you hearing on the ground.

538
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:52,363
Is Kamala's rise for real?

539
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,240
- Well I think you're
hearing a lot of voters

540
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,040
who are really interested in Kamala.

541
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,050
You know, even in Iowa a lot of people

542
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:01,370
are really tuning into this whole process

543
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:04,020
for the first time during
the national debates.

544
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,650
They're seeing this candidates
lined up side by side,

545
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:08,060
and so they're getting their first sense

546
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,710
of how they interact, how
they appeal to voters,

547
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:13,540
and so people are really
interested in Kamala right now,

548
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,380
they're interested to see what
she's gonna be talking about

549
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,820
during her campaign swing here.

550
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,170
She's got several events across the state

551
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:23,120
so we'll be following her
but Joe Biden is also in town

552
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,210
and so people also are curious to see

553
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:29,400
how he's going to respond
to this new pressure.

554
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,110
- That's a great question.

555
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:34,210
The candidate who seems to be
also facing some real trouble

556
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,890
in Iowa right now is Bernie Sanders.

557
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:38,480
In a pre-debate, Sanders was holding out,

558
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,150
holding on in second place at 16% support.

559
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:43,480
Post-debate the USA
Today Suffolk University

560
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,750
poll out of Iowa, he
dropped to fourth place,

561
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:49,900
and for the first time hitting
into the single digits there.

562
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,610
You were just at a Sanders event.

563
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:54,700
What about his message isn't
connecting with folks there?

564
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,750
What are you hearing?

565
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,890
- Well, I think there's a
little bit of a disconnect

566
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:00,840
because the people who like Bernie Sanders

567
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,320
really like Bernie Sanders.

568
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,950
You go to some events and
the people who are there

569
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,170
are very much for him.

570
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:08,860
They're committed to him in a
way that they're not committed

571
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,160
to a lot of these other
candidates on the ground here.

572
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,730
You go to these events and people say,

573
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:15,370
you know I'm shopping around,
I wanna hear from more people,

574
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,930
I'm trying to see what they have to say

575
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,510
but you go to a Bernie Sanders event

576
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,830
and they say, I'm here for Bernie

577
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,580
I'm planning to caucus for him.

578
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,400
So while he certainly slipped in the polls

579
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,340
I wouldn't necessarily underestimate

580
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:29,080
how much support he has here
in Iowa from his core base.

581
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,820
These polls are showing him slipping

582
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,360
and so he may need to adjust
his message a little bit

583
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,720
but I also think we're gonna be seeing

584
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,610
a lot of movement between now
and caucus day in those polls.

585
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:39,180
- And also one thing we
know about Bernie Sanders

586
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,110
is adjusting his message is
not something that he does.

587
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,710
He's had the same message for a long time

588
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,730
and that's what his
supporters love about him.

589
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:47,350
So watching the debate of course
there were a million issues

590
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,780
in the two hour or four
hours over the two nights

591
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,460
that the candidates
cared about, talked about

592
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,510
and were asked about.

593
00:23:53,982 --> 00:23:56,900
Is there one or two issues
that you are hearing

594
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,110
most about from Democrats in Iowa

595
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:02,799
as they're facing this big
field of Democrats right now

596
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,223
to choose from?

597
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,980
- Yeah, and we try to track this a lot.

598
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,860
You know, what questions are
Iowans asking at these events?

599
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,390
What's top of mind for them

600
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:14,050
and we try to do a lot
of polling of the crowds

601
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,570
just one on one as reporters

602
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:17,670
and so what we hear every single time

603
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:19,080
is healthcare is a huge issue

604
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,550
and so where they fall on healthcare,

605
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,190
where they want these candidates

606
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:25,530
to stand on say Medicare for all is vast.

607
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:28,010
There's a lot of differences
in what they want

608
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:30,130
but healthcare is, I
would say, the top issue

609
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:31,340
that we're hearing about

610
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,150
and I think that's followed really closely

611
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,920
by climate change right now.

612
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,380
- Oh, that's really interesting to see,

613
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,530
to hear that from Democrats

614
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:39,892
and can be really telling on maybe

615
00:24:39,892 --> 00:24:41,220
what the messaging will be that we hear

616
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,310
from all the Democrats
that are there right now.

617
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:46,590
Trump won Iowa in the general in 2016,

618
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:49,200
before that Obama won twice in Iowa.

619
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,793
The president was back recently
holding rallies in Iowa.

620
00:24:55,716 --> 00:24:57,900
How is his level of
support in Iowa right now?

621
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,050
What are you hearing
about President Trump?

622
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,840
- Well, among Republicans his support

623
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,010
has stayed very strong in Iowa.

624
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:06,210
You know, all of our polling

625
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:09,490
from the time he was elected
to where he's at right now

626
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:13,390
he gets in the 80s, 80%
support among Republicans

627
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:15,680
who really approve of the job he's doing.

628
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,320
So to the degree that Iowa
Republicans supported him

629
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,320
in 2016 we haven't seen that wavering.

630
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,100
I think there are some
republicans who are skeptical,

631
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,650
certainly some independents
who are shopping around

632
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:28,960
but among his core base

633
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,360
we've really seen those numbers steady.

634
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,800
- Brianne, much more to come.

635
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,980
Thank you so much.

636
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,087
Good luck tracking all these candidates

637
00:25:35,087 --> 00:25:37,183
for the next couple days, thank you.

638
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,473
Programming note for all of you.

639
00:25:39,473 --> 00:25:40,480
A CNN exclusive.

640
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,890
Former Vice President
Joe Biden and his wife

641
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:45,680
Dr. Jill Biden will be
sitting down with Chris Cuomo.

642
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,250
That interview airs Friday morning at six

643
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:51,400
and 8:00 a.m. Eastern only on CNN.

644
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,410
Still to come for us the Supreme Court

645
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:56,420
blocked a question about
citizenship from the U.S. Census.

646
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:59,470
We've talked a lot about that
since that decision happened.

647
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:01,570
The administration then conceded defeat

648
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:03,080
and said that it was
going ahead and printing

649
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,530
the Census forms without
having the question

650
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,260
or without fighting it anymore,

651
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:11,570
but President Trump just now
says that the fight isn't over.

652
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,240
What is going on here?

653
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,663
We'll be back.

654
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:18,550
- [Announcer] This is Rick Blonquest.

655
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,470
His life is pretty comfortable.

656
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:23,100
Then he laid on a Serta
and realized his life

657
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,650
was only just sort of comfortable.

658
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,080
- I've been living a lie.

659
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,330
- [Announcer] The Serta
iComfort Hybrid Mattress.

660
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:31,900
Not just sort of comfortable,
Serta comfortable.

661
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,780
- Okay, I'll admit I didn't keep my place

662
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,410
as clean as I would like
'cause I'm way too busy.

663
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:39,160
Who's got the time to chase
around dirt, dust and hair?

664
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,510
So now I use Heavy Duty
Swiffer Sweeper and Dusters.

665
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:45,870
For hard to reach places
Duster makes it easy to clean.

666
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:48,200
It captures dust in one swipe.

667
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,433
Ha, gotcha!

668
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,520
And Sweeper Heavy Duty cloths lock away

669
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,210
twice as much dirt and dust.

670
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:57,000
It gets stuff deep in the
grooves other tools can miss.

671
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,833
You know what?

672
00:26:57,833 --> 00:27:00,040
My place is a lot cleaner now.

673
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,680
Stop cleaning, start Swiffering.

674
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,853
- He was diagnosed with a large tumor.

675
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:09,210
St. Jude gave us our son back.

676
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,186
This place is saving children every day.

(speaks in foreign language)

678
00:27:20,175 --> 00:27:22,120
- This is a perfectly healthy baby

679
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,573
and then he gets cancer
three months later.

680
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:28,170
- [Announcer] One in
five children diagnosed

681
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:31,183
with cancer in the U.S. will not survive.

682
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:35,140
You can join the battel to save lives

683
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,793
by supporting St. Jude
Children's Research Hospital.

684
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,590
- Without St. Jude and
without the research

685
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:44,313

686
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:49,080

receive a bill from St. Jude

687

for treatment, travel, housing or food

688
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:54,230
because all a family should worry about

689
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:56,053
is helping their child live.

00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,853
so you can go back to being
normal and be stronger.

695
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:15,640

00:28:25,167 --> 00:28:27,600
for the children of St. Jude.

701
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,810
- To people who've donated
I would say, thank you

702
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:32,570
from the bottom of my heart.

703

I wish I could shake each

- My biggest hope, if
I can really be honest,

705
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,263
is for a cure.

706
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,143
I am longing for the day.

707
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:47,590
- St. Jude won't stop until
no child dies from cancer.

708
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:51,490
- My son is with me today

709
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:55,060
You're giving a parent their child back.

Become a St. Jude partner in hope.

00:29:01,941 --> 00:29:04,770
- [Announcer] Oh my, this
Heinz Mayonnaise is so creamy

713
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:06,880
one day you'll tell
your grandkids about it,

714
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,610
and they'll say, "Grandpa just
tell us about Humpty Dumpty."

715
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:11,717
And you'll say, "He broke
his pelvis or whatever.

716
00:29:11,717 --> 00:29:14,370
"Now back to my creamy Heinz Mayonnaise."

717
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:16,760
Heinz Mayonnaise, unforgettably creamy.

718
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,430
- Everyone loves a throwback

719
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:21,580
but I haven't worn that suit
in awhile, or those shoes.

720
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,610
Luckily I still have them

721
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:25,660
because the clothes that
once gave you confidence

722
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:28,600
can help someone get their
career back on track.

723
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,423
So throwback and donate
at Men's Wearhouse today.

- [Boy] How's it going?

725
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,930
- How's what going?

726
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:37,770
The John Hughes scripts, they
just jumped off the page.

- President Trump is
refusing to accept defeat.

761
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:03,360
Denying that his
administration is backing down

762
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,300
just a day after it
announced a huge about face

763
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,360
that it is going to be moving forward

764
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,120
with printing the Census without including

765
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,220
the citizenship question

766
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,570
that Trump officials had
fought so hard to include.

767
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:16,670
Moments ago President Trump spoke out

768
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:19,460
denying the position of
his own administration.

769
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,737
Tweeting this in part.

770
00:31:20,737 --> 00:31:22,587
"We are absolutely
moving forward as we must

771
00:31:22,587 --> 00:31:25,580
"because of the importance of
this answer to this question."

772
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:27,480
Aside from the fac that that
seems a little bit confusing

773
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,620
this is like the second tweet
that he had about this today

774
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,580
and he is saying that
they're gonna fight on.

775
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,750
So, he's not giving up now?

776
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,020
But what can he do?

777
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,880
The forms are being printed according

778
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,940
to the Commerce Department,
and the Supreme Court

779
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,550
told the administration that they had

780
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,500
to go back to the drawing board

781
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,810
if they even wanted to
consider this question again.

782
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:46,950
Joining me right now to
hopefully get some answers here

CNN Supreme Court
reporter, Ariane de Vogue.

784
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:52,570
Ariane, what can the
president do at this point?

785
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:55,670
- Well, those tweets
certainly seem to leave open

786
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:57,450
the possibility but he might be having

787
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:59,630
to pull a rabbit out of a hat here, Kate

788
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:03,450
because yesterday Secretary
Ross's statement was definitive

789
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:06,090
and the Department of
Justice told the court

790
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,750
that the decision was final

791
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,400
according to plaintiff's lawyers

792
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,270
and one of the reasons is, is
they have big hurdles here.

793
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:15,080
They have a Census official who testified

794
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,250
that waiting until October
to print those questionnaires

795
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,870
could jeopardize the
administration of the Census

796
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:24,650
and he also said that it
would take a lot of resources

797
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:27,040
to do so, and on top of that there's two

798
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,280
collateral legal proceedings
happening in the lower courts.

799
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,620
In New York one judge
is considering sanctions

800
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:36,120
against the government for new evidence

801
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,580
that had been recently disclosed

802
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,110
that suggested that the decision

803
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,590
might have been politically motivated.

804
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:42,310
And another judge in Maryland

805
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,930
he was considering at
least reopening the case,

806
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:48,610
more deposition, more testimony.

807
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:51,140
A government official told me today

808
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,370
that the decision was
final, that they just looked

809
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:57,540
at these deadlines and the
possibility of more injunctions

810
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,760
and they thought it wasn't realistic.

811
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,640
But maybe what the
president is talking about

812
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,900
is what the Census officials
have argued all along.

813
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,000
Keep in mind Census officials had said,

814
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,520
there's other ways to
get this information.

815
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,090
It doesn't have to be on the question.

816
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:12,910
For instance they can
get it through other data

817
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:16,130
with the government, and there's a survey

818
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:17,880
that goes out to some households

819
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,860
and asks the questions.

820
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:21,580
So maybe that's what the
president is talking about

821
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,830
but it's a little unclear right now, Kate.

822
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:24,663
- A little unclear?

823
00:33:24,663 --> 00:33:27,260
It's a lot unclear if you will, Ariane

824
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,550
and I think this goes into the category

825
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:29,730
of I don't know if it's dream world

826
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:32,250
versus reality but in the very least

827
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:35,460
because the Commerce Secretary
says the Census papers

828
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:38,380
are being printed without the question

829
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:41,360
it's at least maybe don't listen
to what the president says

830
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,230
just look at what he actually does

831
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,963
and let's see if he actually
tries to fight this change

832
00:33:44,963 --> 00:33:46,680
just to do anything about it

833
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,000
or he just wants to tweet about it.

834
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,140
Thanks, Ariane.

835
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,120

This is Battle Vision by Atomic Beam.

862
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,230
Inspired by U.S. soldiers

Hi, I'm Hunter Ellis

when it matters most.

867
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:05,530
Battle Vision lets you
see in high definition

868
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:08,880
and even blocks dangerous
glare helping to keep you safe.

869
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,340
Unlike regular glasses these high tech

870
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:14,200
HD polarized lenses help you see objects

871
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,810
the naked eye can't detect.

872
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:18,300
Out on the water and the
reflection's too much?

873
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,540
Battle Vision's polarized lenses
filter out reflected light

874
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:24,240
knocking down glare so you can see clearly

875
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,830
in ultra high definition.

876
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:28,440
They help eliminate glare, enhance color

877
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:32,530
and provide UV protection for
exceptional optical clarity.

878
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:35,900
Battle Vision can be twisted
and tortured without breaking.

879
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,170
The lenses can withstand
hard drops and knocks.

880
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:41,330
Sand, rocks, glass, even metal

881
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:43,050
are no match for Battle Vision.

882
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:46,340
Look, regular glasses just
make everything darker

883
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:49,520
so whether you're out skiing
or out on the open road

884

cut the glare and see with Battle Vision.

00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,560
voluntary public service
programs in the country

953
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,090
with a goal, according to the campaign,

954
00:38:58,090 --> 00:38:59,900
of attracting a quarter
of a million Americans

955
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,590
to serve in the near term

956
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,030
and potentially more down the road.

957
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:03,863
We're talking about programs

958
00:39:03,863 --> 00:39:06,170
like AmeriCorps and the Peace Corps.

959
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:08,430
But while he's promoting
the call to service

960
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,510
the mayor is also dealing
with continued questions

961
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:12,060
about his leadership back home.

962
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,760
Racial tension flaring up
in South Bend last month

963
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,670
after a white police officer
shot and killed a black man

964
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:20,770
who approached the officer
with a knife raised,

965
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:22,030
that's according to the police.

966
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:25,340
The case has fueled
anger from the community

967
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,880
and activists and police.

968
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,970
Just yesterday the Fraternal
Order of Police in South Bend

969
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:32,380
called for Buttigieg to remove himself

970
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:35,750
from any involvement
in that investigation.

971
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:38,350
Buttigieg addressed the
controversy again yesterday.

972
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,660
- Events compel me to acknowledge

973
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:45,373
that whatever we've done
has not been nearly enough.

974
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,140
As long as a traffic stop

975
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,600
is a completely different experience

976
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,640
for a black driver than
it is for a white driver

977
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,813
we know we have not done nearly enough.

978
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,470
We know that as long
as police departments,

979
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:04,080
and this is true of my own,
do not reflect the community

980
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:07,400
they serve in their makeup
then we have not done enough.

981
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,450
I accept responsibility

982
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:11,423
for the work that is left to be done.

983
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:15,030
- Joining me right now is the president

984
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:17,110
of the South Bend
Fraternal Order of Police.

985
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,580
Police Sergeant Harvey Mills.

986
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,830
Sergeant, thank you for being here.

987
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:22,330
- Thank you, Kate.

988
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:24,090
- In your statement yesterday

989
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:27,030
in calling for the mayor
to pull himself off

990
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:31,057
of the investigation you
said that the mayor is quote,

991
00:40:31,057 --> 00:40:33,197
"More concerned about boosting his own

992
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:35,117
"presidential political campaign

993
00:40:35,117 --> 00:40:37,750
"than insuring a fair investigation."

994
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:39,133
why do you think that?

995
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,210
- Ma'am, several of
the comments he's made,

996
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:46,270
he's already called for the,

997
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:47,980
or he's already stated that this officer

998
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,220
will be held accountable,

999
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,370
well the investigation's
not even complete.

1000
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:57,390
This officer was justified
in defending himself

1001
00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:00,873
against a man with an
eight inch hunting knife.

1002
00:41:04,927 --> 00:41:08,560
It's just absurd that he would
make statements like that

1003
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,803
as well as calling all officers racist.

1004
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:16,130
- I wanted to get to that
because I heard you say that.

1005
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:18,590
I've heard you say that
you think that the mayor

1006
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,350
has called all officers racist

1007
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:27,050
and I looked back at what
he said during the debate

1008
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:31,000
and I also looked at
what he said on Monday

1009
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,900
and he was talking about systemic racism

1010
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,990
and here's how he explained it on Monday.

1011
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:37,347
He said that, "Every
mayor works in the shadows

1012
00:41:37,347 --> 00:41:39,007
"of systemic racism.

1013
00:41:39,007 --> 00:41:42,327
"Every resident lives in the
shadow of systemic racism,

1014
00:41:42,327 --> 00:41:44,157
"people of color and people who are not.

1015
00:41:44,157 --> 00:41:47,710
"So this is not an attack
on our police department"

1016
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:50,210
is specifically what the mayor said.

1017
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:52,500
He says he's not calling
out the South Bend Police.

1018
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,010
He says he's calling,

1019
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:57,190
he's saying that every city in America,

1020
00:41:57,190 --> 00:42:01,170
every mayor in America has to deal with

1021
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:04,980
the issue of systemic
racism that does exist.

1022
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:08,440
I mean, surely you would
agree that every city, mayor,

1023
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:12,193
police department in America
should stand up to that.

1024
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:17,540
- No ma'am I really don't
believe that's the issue.

1025
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:21,740
The issue is not race at all
especially with this incident

1026
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,853
color has absolutely nothing to do with.

1027
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:29,350
Systemic is including everyone and--

1028
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:30,527
- Systemic means common though.

1029
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:34,583
And systemic racism is
an issue in the country.

1030
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,430
- Well, the definition actually
of systemic actually says

1031
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:45,980
the system, so that's what he's called for

1032
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,770
and many of the comments he's made,

1033
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:52,380
even the ones he just made
on Monday were backpedaling

1034
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,080
from what he had mentioned before.

1035
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:59,270
- Let me play for you, the
mayor was asked to respond

1036
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:01,780
to your criticism yesterday
and to recuse himself

1037
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:02,640
from the investigation.

1038
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,863
Let me play for you his response.

1039
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:09,590
- Well, first of all I don't
make disciplinary decisions

1040
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:12,380
so I would expect them to understand

1041
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:16,160
that this is a matter
for our Board of Safety

1042
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,930
which is a board of civilians
that I appoint to take up

1043
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:23,540
and I've been careful not
to weigh in on the incident

1044
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:25,453
while the investigation is going on.

1045
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:29,030
But one of the things I
really need to continue

1046
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:31,460
conveying to our police officers

1047
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:36,350
is that it is not anti-police
to be pro-racial justice.

1048
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:38,640
On the contrary we absolutely can

1049
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,983
and absolutely must be both.

1050
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:43,890
- They mayor says the
investigation's being handled

1051
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:45,200
by the Board of Safety.

1052
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,800
What would removing himself

1053
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,550
from the investigation actually do?

1054
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,040
- If he continues to talk about it,

1055
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,980
especially on a presidential campaign

1056
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:57,040
it influences all of those
members on the Board of Safety

1057
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,500
and those are handpicked by him,

1058
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,950
members of the Board of
Safety so they would be

1059
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:05,530
greatly influenced by any of his words

1060
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:09,550
so he should not mention
this investigation at all

1061
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:11,591
on his presidential campaign.

1062
00:44:11,591 --> 00:44:14,933
- Have you reached out to
the mayor to discuss this?

1063
00:44:18,532 --> 00:44:20,310
- Mayor Buttigieg has called me,

1064
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:22,530
we have not had a dialogue
but we are willing

1065
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:23,430
to have a dialogue.

1066
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:24,920
It is needed.

1067
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,040
He had ignored previous requests

1068
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:34,750
before the shooting to speak with the FOP

1069
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:36,700
on other issues.

1070
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,070
- Well, I look forward
to hearing what comes

1071
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:39,550
of that conversation, Sergeant.

1072
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:40,445
We'll check back in with you.

1073
00:44:40,445 --> 00:44:42,147
Thank you for being here.

1074
00:44:42,147 --> 00:44:43,660
- Thank you.

1075
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:46,080
- Coming up, "As you wish."

1076
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,230
Remember that line?

1077
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:48,910
It's one of the many classic,

1078
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:50,960
and there are millions of
them basically from this movie

1079
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,880
you can hear my bias in my voice now.

1080
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,767
Millions of classic one
liners from the movie,

1081
00:44:54,767 --> 00:44:55,940
"The Princess Bride".

1082
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:58,440
Cary Elwes who played Westley of course

1083
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,240
joins us to talk about
the iconic '80s film

1084
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,590
and the new CNN original
series, "The Movies".

1085
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:04,518
We'll be right back.

1086
00:45:04,518 --> 00:45:07,101
(upbeat music)

1087
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,380
- [Announcer] Summer's not stopping

1088
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:14,490
or slowing down.

1089
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:19,200
So take advantage of all
of summer's opportunities

1090
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,650
with our limited time
offers while you still can.

1091
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,580
Hurry into the Acura
Summer of Performance Event

1092
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:27,413
going on now.

1093
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:31,730
Visit your local Acura dealer

1094
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:33,640
to test drive the 2019 ILX.

1095
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,847
Starting MSRP 25,900.

1096
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:43,593
- [Announcer] Do your asthma
symptoms ever hold you back?

1097
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,340
About 50% of people with severe asthma

1098
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:51,360
have too many cells called,
eosinophils in their lungs.

1099
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,910
Eosinophils are a key
cause of severe asthma.

1100
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:57,850
Fasenra is designed to target
and remove these cells.

1101
00:45:57,850 --> 00:46:00,640
Fasenra is an add on
injection for people 12 and up

1102
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,850
with asthma driven by eosinophils.

1103
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:04,410
Fasenra is not a rescue medicine

1104
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:06,810
or for other eosinophilic conditions.

1105
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:10,200
Fasenra is proven to help
prevent severe asthma attacks,

1106
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,120
improve breathing and can
lower oral steroid use.

1107
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:15,780
Fasenra may cause allergic reactions.

help with our retirement.

I do not think it means
what you think it means.

1209

a blend between romance,

satire, adventure, swashbuckling.

it's a very strange mixture

00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:34,120
the legacy of, "The Princess
Bride" in the context

1238
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:36,270
of this CNN look into the movies

1239
00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:38,760
in this episode that we're looking at

1240
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,910
I wanna read you how director Rob Reiner

1241
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:42,610
describes, "The Princess Bride".

1242
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:43,957
He describes it as

1243
00:51:43,957 --> 00:51:47,960
"A blend between romance, satire,
adventure, swashbuckling".

1244
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:49,557
And he says, "I mean it's all mixed into

1245
00:51:49,557 --> 00:51:52,730
"a strange mixture
that's hard to capture".

1246
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:56,580
It got me thinking when
this first came out in 1987

1247
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:58,140
the studio didn't even
know how to market it.

1248
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:00,760
Is it because it was
such a strange mixture

1249
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:02,940
that made it such a classic do you think?

1250
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:04,450
- I think that's part of it, Kate.

1251
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:07,620
It was a hard film for them to market

1252
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:09,010
because they couldn't figure out

1253
00:52:09,010 --> 00:52:11,820
which genre they should focus on.

1254
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:14,820
Was it a romance film,
was it an adventure,

1255
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:17,000
was it a fantasy, was it a comedy?

1256
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,310
And they'd never seen a
film like that before.

1257
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:20,720
In fact I don't think anyone had

1258
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:25,620
so I mean Rob describes
it perfectly when he says

1259
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:30,620
that he wanted us to just make sure

1260
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:34,090
that we didn't play the lines for laughs.

1261
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:36,540
- When did you first know that the film

1262
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:37,560
had found its audience?

1263
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:42,560
That it was so much, it was
so, it had such following.

1264
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:46,290
- Well, you know it's interesting Kate.

1265
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:48,570
It didn't have a big
following when it came out.

1266
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:50,710
It came out the same time
as, "Fatal Attraction"

1267
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:52,740
which just cleared out every other movie

1268
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:55,025
that was competing with it.

1269
00:52:55,025 --> 00:52:56,435
- Slightly different
from, "Fatal Attraction."

1270
00:52:56,435 --> 00:52:57,268
- Slightly different genre

1271
00:52:57,268 --> 00:53:02,268
but again the poster that Fox
came up with was very unusual.

1272
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:04,790
It didn't really sell the movie very well

1273
00:53:06,406 --> 00:53:08,417
and it was a very beautiful poster

1274
00:53:08,417 --> 00:53:10,180
but nobody knew what the film was.

1275
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:13,110
Was it a kids movie, was it
a girls movie with the title

1276
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:15,070
and it's only through word of mouth

1277
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:20,050
it was really the college
campuses that students

1278
00:53:20,050 --> 00:53:21,840
that really picked up on the film.

1279
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:24,150
And it wasn't until 10
years later when the film

1280
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:27,410
came out on VHS that it had this,

1281
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:29,560
it literally went from being mostly dead

1282
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:31,590
to having a whole new life

1283
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:34,170
and I'll never forget, I was in New York

1284
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:37,050
and I was ordering a
hamburger or something

1285
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:38,457
in a restaurant and the waitress said,

1286
00:53:38,457 --> 00:53:39,290
"How do you want that cooked?"

1287
00:53:39,290 --> 00:53:41,950
And I said, "Medium rare"
and she goes, "As you wish."

1288
00:53:42,854 --> 00:53:44,090
And that was the first time I'd heard it

1289
00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:45,820
being said by anyone.

1290
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:48,487
And my life changed after that.

1291
00:53:48,487 --> 00:53:53,487
I forever people asking me on
the street to say that line.

1292
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,180
- You wrote about the experience.

1293
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:59,430
You wrote a memoir in 2014
about the making of the film.

1294
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:04,120
Was it as much fun to
make as it was to watch.

1295
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:06,360
- Well that's why I wrote the book, Kate.

1296
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,387
'Cause fans always come up to me and say,

1297
00:54:08,387 --> 00:54:11,010
"Was it as much fun
making it as it looks?"

1298
00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:12,960
And I said it was more fun.

1299
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,710
And I realized that that wasn't sufficient

1300
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:20,240
to make them feel
satisfied and so I thought

1301
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,830
well I should write a book about it

1302
00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:24,840
and share it with everyone
just how much fun it really was

1303
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:27,610
and I think you can see it
translates onto the screen.

1304
00:54:27,610 --> 00:54:30,080
I can't remember a single
day without laughter.

1305
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:33,290
- That's so good to hear
as someone who's such a fan

1306
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:34,200
of the film.

1307
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,210
There are so many one liners.

1308
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:38,700
I was just kind of banting
them about with my producer

1309
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:40,170
before we came to you.

1310
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:44,410
Other than, "As you wish" what
are some of the other ones

1311
00:54:44,410 --> 00:54:45,243
that always stick in your head?

1312
00:54:45,243 --> 00:54:46,620
What would you say your favorites are?

1313
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:49,440
- Oh my gosh, I love,
"Anybody want a peanut?"

1314
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:50,623
which is just silly.

1315
00:54:51,577 --> 00:54:56,577
"Never get involved in a land
war in Asia" is pretty great.

1316
00:54:57,450 --> 00:54:59,517
- Do not forget, "My
name is Inigo Montoya.

1317
00:54:59,517 --> 00:55:00,837
"You killed my father, prepare to die."

1318
00:55:00,837 --> 00:55:04,920
- I mean, you know Paul
Mandy says he gets asked that

1319
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,810
literally every five minutes.

1320
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:08,410
It's incredible.

1321
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:12,040
Wally Shawn said he can't walk
down the street in New York

1322
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:14,650
without somebody saying,
"Inconceivable" to him.

1323
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:16,670
If he drops his keys or misses a cab

1324
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:18,300
or is late for an airplane,

1325
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:20,233
you know somebody says it to him.

1326
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:24,650
- I still try to drop
"Princess Bride" lines on TV

1327
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:28,030
whenever humanly possible
probably much to the eye rolls

1328
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:29,100
of my entire audience.

1329
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:32,520
- That's hilarious, that's
hilarious, that's great to know.

1330
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:33,810
- Thank you so much for being here

1331
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:34,643
and sharing with us.

1332
00:55:34,643 --> 00:55:35,680
- My pleasure.

1333
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:36,693
Thank you, Kate.

1334
00:55:38,077 --> 00:55:41,100
- [Kate] "The Movies" premiers
Sunday night, nine Eastern

1335
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:44,200
and Pacific only on CNN.

1336
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:49,040
Coming up next the acting
DHS Chief vows to take action

1337
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,950
after a report reveals
a secret Facebook group

1338
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:51,880
from border agents.

1339
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:52,713
We'll be back.

1340
00:55:54,970 --> 00:55:56,740
- [Announcer] This is Anne Marie Pegils.

1341
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:59,840
Her Saturdays are a never
ending montage of comfort.

1342
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:01,240
- [Man] Where have you been all my life?

1343
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:03,950
- [Announcer] But then Anne
laid on a Serta Perfect Sleeper

1344
00:56:03,950 --> 00:56:07,170
and realized her life was
only just sorta comfortable.

1345
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:09,623
Not just sorta comfortable,
Serta comfortable.

1346
00:56:10,790 --> 00:56:12,690
- My insurance rates are
probably gonna double.

1347
00:56:12,690 --> 00:56:14,160
- But Dad you've got

1348
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,010
- [Man] Allstate with accident forgiveness

1349
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:17,730
that guarantee your rates won't go up

1350
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:19,460
just because of an accident.

1351
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:20,510
- Smart kid.

1352
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:21,343
- [Man] Indeed.

1353
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,083
Are you in good hands?

1354
00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:26,550
- Reality check everyone.

1355
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:28,350
People look at your jawline.

1356
00:56:28,350 --> 00:56:29,710
- [Announcer] That's right, no one wants

1357
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:31,990
a sagging jawline or double chin.

1358
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:34,020
- As we get a little
older the jawline starts

1359
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:35,070
to sag a little bit.

1360
00:56:35,070 --> 00:56:37,910
- I need a product that's
going to step in and help me.

1361
00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:39,920
- [Announcer] Now you can

00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,330
The immediate tightening effect that I saw

1369

00:56:57,604 --> 00:57:01,070
- I saw results immediately
after using Genucel.

1371
00:57:01,070 --> 00:57:04,000
- I started using the
Genucel jawline product

1372
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,840

the results I received.

of the skin around the jawline

1376
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:14,250

1383
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:30,040
to contour and define the
jawline within minutes.

1384
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:32,960
- Genucel works so well that my phone

1385
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,100
didn't even recognize me.

1386
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:36,340
I had to reset my face ID.

1387
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:39,070
- I never thought I would
use any kind of product

1388
00:57:39,070 --> 00:57:41,580
on my face and when I
started using Genucel

1409
00:58:26,130 --> 00:58:28,620
- [Announcer] When
redesigning the Honda HR-V LX

1410
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:31,740
and new sport we thought
why not make them adaptable?

1411
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:34,480
For big stuff and small stuff.

1412
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:35,800
And why not nimble?

1413
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,250
Tight corners kind of nimble.

1414
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:39,710
And why not smart?

1415
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:42,760
Not just street smart, tech smart?

1416
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:46,000
And why not end with a
statement no one else can make?

1417
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,476
The redesigned HR-V.

1418
00:58:47,476 --> 00:58:50,059
(upbeat music)

1419
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:55,960
- The deli scene.

1420
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:58,040
When we first did it Meg, rightfully,

1421
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:59,320
was a little nervous about it.

1422
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:01,603
You got crew members standing around.

1423
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:03,293
- You okay?

1424
00:59:03,293 --> 00:59:04,760
- Rob says, "Here's what I want".

1425
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,070
He proceeds to have an orgasm

1426
00:59:06,070 --> 00:59:09,010
that Mighty Joe Young would be jealous of.

1427
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:11,876
- Yes, oh God, I'm pounding the table.

1428
00:59:11,876 --> 00:59:13,350
- Yes, yes!

1429
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:15,490
- And I realize 'cause my
mother is sitting there

1430
00:59:15,490 --> 00:59:17,400
I'm having an orgasm
in front of my mother.

1431
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,760
- I'll have what she's having.

love and the stories behind them

1433

1434
00:59:25,330 --> 00:59:26,490

1435
00:59:26,490 --> 00:59:27,820

1442
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:41,600
- No wrong move!

1443
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:43,470
Old fashioned bandages get dirty.

1444
00:59:43,470 --> 00:59:45,030
They can let in water and germs.

1445
00:59:45,030 --> 00:59:46,700
Look, it's falling off.

1446
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:49,220
New Skin is the flexible liquid bandage

1447
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:50,700
that seals out the bad stuff.

1448
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:52,560
There's a spray too.

1449
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:55,070

rethink how you heal.
