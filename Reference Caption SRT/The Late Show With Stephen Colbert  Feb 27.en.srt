- Us a quote.

2
00:00:00,923 --> 00:00:02,040
It was so easy.

3
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,269
Dan even helped pay to pack and move us.

4
00:00:04,269 --> 00:00:07,230
MarketPro Homebuyers
truly helped my family

5
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:08,770
when we did not know what to do.

6
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:13,770
- [Narrator] Call us

11
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,580
- Let's see, I've got
all my Super Bowl snacks.

12
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,360
I've got pigs in a blanket,

13
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,949
pigs out of blankets, and just blankets.

14

friend, Sir Patrick Stewart.

17
00:00:39,738 --> 00:00:41,230
Hey thanks for being here.

18
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:43,658
I had no idea you were
such a Super Bowl fan.

19
00:00:43,658 --> 00:00:45,300
- Oh, of course!

20
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,898
I love American football.

21
00:00:47,898 --> 00:00:50,277
They get to use their hands.

22
00:00:50,277 --> 00:00:51,327
(audience laughs)

23
00:00:51,327 --> 00:00:54,657
Oh, let's get this mother started, yeehaw!

(audience laughs)

30
00:01:19,377 --> 00:01:21,263
- Gritwold G. Grittington.

31
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,410
I hope you don't mind,
but I brought a friend.

32
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:26,760
He was just outside now, parking the van.

33
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,180
- Oh, sorry for the confusion earlier.

34
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,013
Shake?

35
00:01:32,784 --> 00:01:34,080
(audience laughs)

36
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,970
- Gritty and I go way back.

37
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,770
We used to be in the Royal
Shakespeare Company together.

38
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,810
- Oh, sure, Hamlet.

39
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,060
- No, Gritty played Juliet.

40
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,125
I have no idea where the skull came from.

41
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:48,220
(audience laughs)

42
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,053

Oh, doorbell.

and Senate Democratic
Leader Chuck Schumer?

53
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,270
- Please Stephen, we're friends.

54
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,601
- Just call us Chuck and
Speaker of the House Nancy.

55
00:02:16,601 --> 00:02:19,539
- Okay, so what are you guys doing here?

56
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:22,720
- We figured your little
get together needed us.

57
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,782
- Why is that?

58
00:02:24,782 --> 00:02:27,036
- [Both] 'Cause we're the party leaders.

59
00:02:27,036 --> 00:02:28,699
(rock music)

60
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:29,532
- Gritty!

61
00:02:30,634 --> 00:02:33,000
(audience laughs)

62
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,318
Well I'm glad you're here.

63
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:35,151
Why don't you come on in?

64
00:02:35,151 --> 00:02:36,840
- Oh no, there's more
trouble in Washington.

65
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,450
- We gotta go.

66
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,333
- Oh, okay.
- Juice it, Nancy!

67
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,935

68
00:02:43,935 --> 00:02:46,435
(audience applauds)

69
00:02:46,435 --> 00:02:47,897
Gritty, if that's out of tune.

(crowd cheers)

71
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,460
- Come on, get in there!

72
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,820
Knock his head off!

73
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,355
- Patrick, this is the halftime show.

74
00:02:56,355 --> 00:02:58,670
♪ I got the moves ♪

75
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,260
- I'm aware of that.

76
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,076
Snap his femur!

77
00:03:02,076 --> 00:03:07,076
(audience laughs)
(rock music)

78
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:08,770
- What do you wanna do now?

79
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:11,710
- Well, I hear there's
an all new Late Show.

80
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,980
- On Sunday?
- Mhmm.

81
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,361
- Let's check that out.

82
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:15,635
(crowd cheers)

83
00:03:15,635 --> 00:03:17,430
Huh, that's weird.

84
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,075
Where's the host?

85
00:03:19,075 --> 00:03:21,658
(crowd cheers)

86
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,303
Oh god!

87
00:03:30,303 --> 00:03:31,350
I'm supposed to be there.

88
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,930
Captain, beam me up!

89
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:35,567
- Stephen, that's not a real thing.

90
00:03:35,567 --> 00:03:36,510
(audience laughs)

91
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:37,992
- It is to me.

92
00:03:37,992 --> 00:03:38,825
Gritwold.

93
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:42,539
(device beeping)

94
00:03:43,627 --> 00:03:44,460
- Gritwold!

95
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,700
You have violated the prime directive.

96
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,750
Give that back to me.

97
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,668
- [Announcer] It's The Late
Show with Stephen Colbert

98
00:03:51,668 --> 00:03:53,130
Super Bowl Edition.

99
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:55,752
Tonight, are you ready for some Late Show?

100
00:03:55,752 --> 00:03:58,835
Plus, Stephen welcomes Conan O'Brien.

101
00:03:59,992 --> 00:04:02,589
Musical guest James Taylor,

102
00:04:02,589 --> 00:04:05,832
and a special appearance by Steve Carell,

103
00:04:05,832 --> 00:04:09,517
featuring Jon Batiste and Stay Human.

104
00:04:09,517 --> 00:04:13,267
And now, live on tape from
the Ed Sullivan Theater

105
00:04:13,267 --> 00:04:16,974
in New York City, it's Stephen Colbert!

106
00:04:16,974 --> 00:04:21,974

107
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,103
- Woo!

108
00:04:24,524 --> 00:04:25,357
Hello!

109
00:04:26,289 --> 00:04:28,872
(crowd cheers)

110
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:36,277
Beautiful, please have a seat everybody.

111
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:37,483
Thanks so much.

112
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,600
Welcome one and all, ladies
and gentlemen to The Late Show.

113
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,460
I'm your host, Stephen Colbert.

114
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,572
Happy, happy Super Bowl Sunday.

115
00:04:45,572 --> 00:04:47,470
(crowd cheers)

116
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:48,830
It's always an exciting night.

117
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,972
It's a great day, it's a great day.

118
00:04:49,972 --> 00:04:50,805
It's a great day.

119
00:04:50,805 --> 00:04:53,340
It's our one true national holiday.

120
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,330
This is the one day, when
despite our divisions,

121
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:56,840
Americans come together

122
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,550
around their TVs, and for
just one beautiful moment

123
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,528
don't fast forward
through the commercials.

124
00:05:02,528 --> 00:05:04,240
(audience laughs)

125
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,073
- On this great Sunday.
- We all wanna see

126
00:05:05,073 --> 00:05:06,641
which talking animal
wants to sell us beer.

127
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:07,940
(audience laughs)

128
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,118
Which celebrity really wanted the money.

129
00:05:10,118 --> 00:05:11,650
(audience laughs)

130
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,120
I've been there, my brothers and sisters.

131
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,953
You enjoy that.

132
00:05:13,953 --> 00:05:16,240
- On this great Sunday.
- Another annual tradition

133
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,580
is the pre-game presidential interview.

134
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,418
Goes back to the very first Super Bowl,

135
00:05:20,418 --> 00:05:22,759
when Lyndon Johnson made
the surprise announcement

136
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:25,239
that he was sending both teams to Vietnam.

137
00:05:25,239 --> 00:05:27,340
(audience laughs)

138
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,840
Yeah.
- Oh wow.

139
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,599
- Fun fact, that's how
the NFL draft started.

140
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:33,510
(audience laughs)
- Oh my!

141
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:37,070
- Last year, last, is this last year?

142
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,185
Last year, Trump skipped the interview,

143
00:05:39,185 --> 00:05:41,930
but Friday he sat down
with Margaret Brennan

144
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,700
of CBS's Face the Nation,

145
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,963
and he brought the nation
a whole lot of face.

146
00:05:45,963 --> 00:05:46,796
(audience laughs)

147
00:05:46,796 --> 00:05:49,280
He started by describing how he believes

148
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,883
he's in a good position to
declare a national emergency

149
00:05:51,883 --> 00:05:53,830
to get his border wall

150
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:57,850
when negotiations with
Congress end on February 15th.

151
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:00,070
- When you have people
dying all over the country

152
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,100
because of people like Nancy Pelosi,

153
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,870
who don't want to give
proper border security

154
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,220
for political reasons.

155
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,250
She's doing a terrible
disservice to our country,

156
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,950
and on the 15th we have now
set the table beautifully.

157
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:16,080
- Not a hopeful sign, 'cause
we all know what it looks like

158
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,043
when Trump sets the table beautifully.

159
00:06:18,043 --> 00:06:19,983
(audience laughs)

160
00:06:19,983 --> 00:06:21,900
And so, look how, look.

161
00:06:23,681 --> 00:06:25,862
Look how beautiful.

162
00:06:25,862 --> 00:06:26,695
Look how.

163
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,220
The subject turned to
sports when Brennan asked

164
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:34,310
if Trump would let a child
of his play football.

165
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,897
- It's very, it's a very tough question

166
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,210
and it's a very good question.

167
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,490
If he wanted to, yes.

168
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,610
Would I steer him that way?

169
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,237
No I wouldn't.
- Why?

170
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:45,050
- And he actually plays a lot of soccer.

171
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,150
He's liking soccer, and a
lot of people including me

172
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,640
thought soccer would probably
never make it in this country,

173
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,050
but it really is moving forward rapidly.

174
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:58,050
- Yes, we, we tried to keep
soccer out for a long time, but,

175
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:01,540
but it's hard, it's moving so rapidly.

176
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,070
That's how the caravan does it.

177
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:06,580
They just dribble their
kids up to the border,

178
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,222
and then just a little bit of that,

179
00:07:09,222 --> 00:07:11,041
little bit of this, little bit of that.

180
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,541
Little dip dip, dah, dah, dah.

181
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,545
Little dah, and then they
bicycle kick him into El Paso.

182
00:07:18,545 --> 00:07:19,378
(audience laughs)

183
00:07:19,378 --> 00:07:20,211

(audience laughs)

185
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,253
That's really why we need the wall.

186
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,760
But it's so hard to build
when you can't use your hands.

187
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,799
(audience laughs)

188
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:31,403

Is that soccer, is it?

- And he explained his
concerns about football.

193
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,850
- I just don't like the reports that I see

194

coming out having to do with football.

195

199
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:55,090

But, here's the deal.

206
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,886
Trump's not gonna be president forever.

I don't know, I don't know.

- [Jon] They clapping for that.

212
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:23,210
- We're barely a month into 2019

213
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:25,730
and we've already got at
least 10 different candidates

214
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:28,290
hoping to secure the
Democratic Party's nomination,

215
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:31,060
'cause on Friday another
Democrat entered the race.

216
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,890
New Jersey senator and man trying to pass

217
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,943
universal healthcare with his mind,

218
00:08:35,943 --> 00:08:37,560
(audience laughs)

219
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,393
Cory Booker.

220
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:43,010
Here's a little taste of Cory
Booker's video announcement.

221
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:45,060
- When I was a baby, my
parents tried to move us

222
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,190
into a neighborhood with
great public schools,

223
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,530
but realtors wouldn't sell us a home

224
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,650
because of the color of our skin.

225
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:53,730
So over 20 years ago, I moved into

226
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:56,940
the central ward of
Newark to fight slumlords,

227
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,080
and help families stay in their homes.

228
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,800
I still live there today.

229
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,490
- That is inspiring,
and I gotta say daring.

230
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,542
I've never seen anyone so
proud to be from Newark.

231
00:09:08,542 --> 00:09:09,800
(audience laughs)

232
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,890
Newark, home of the airport

233
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,703
you didn't realize you were landing at.

234
00:09:13,703 --> 00:09:14,950
(audience laughs)

235
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:17,180
Come, because you're lost.

236
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,485
Stay, because you're lost.

237
00:09:19,485 --> 00:09:20,740
(audience laughs)

238
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:24,140
Remember when all those
parked cars caught on fire?

239
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,720
That was this week.

240
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,322
This week, in Newark.

241
00:09:28,322 --> 00:09:29,660
(audience laughs)

242
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,310
And, there was a lot of not so subtle

243
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,380
anti-Trump messaging in this ad.

244
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,360
Booker tells the story
of a racist landlord

245
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,700
turning away his parents.

246
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,040
Imagery of kids in cages,
and of course a scene of him

247
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,746
in a barbershop, which is
an obvious dig at Trump

248
00:09:43,746 --> 00:09:47,243
since it implies Booker could
grow hair, but chooses not to.

249
00:09:47,243 --> 00:09:49,359
(audience laughs)

250
00:09:49,359 --> 00:09:50,685

254

with the name of his campaign, Cory 2020.

255
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,540
Bold move, going with the first name.

256
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,920
If you'll recall, that did not work out

257

about having a President Cory.

00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,996

Also tomorrow, Taraji P.
Henson is gonna be here.

That's gonna be fantastic.

392
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,250
Never interviewed her
before, right first time?

393
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,930
Think so.
- Yeah.

394
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:48,440
- Of course, as I said this
is our Super Bowl special,

395
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,930
and I love football.

396
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,730
I've always wanted to play
the game professionally,

397
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:52,880
but my doctor says I can't

398
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,681
because I have a medical
condition known as mortality.

399
00:15:55,681 --> 00:15:58,550
(audience laughs)

400
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,970
But there is some football

401
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:02,090
I am healthy enough to participate in,

402
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:05,220
the video game kind, and
luckily the good folks

403
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,321
over at EA Sports

404
00:16:06,321 --> 00:16:10,458
agreed to make me a player
in the new Madden NFL 19.

405
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:13,179
(audience cheers)

406
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:15,420
- Yeah baby!
- Here's the deal.

407
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,070
I was excited, obviously,

408
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,970
but in order to make the most life-like

409
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,110
and accurate digital version of me,

410
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:24,838
they first needed hard data
on my athletic abilities.

411
00:16:24,838 --> 00:16:25,671
(audience laughs)

412
00:16:25,671 --> 00:16:26,640
So I headed out to the

413
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,250
Atlantic Health New York
Jets Training Center,

414
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,913
and put my skills to the test.

415
00:16:31,815 --> 00:16:34,390
(intense music)

416
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:37,681
Stephen Colbert, Northwestern
University, theater major.

417
00:16:37,681 --> 00:16:39,380
(intense music)

418
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,850
I've always been told I
don't have what it takes

419
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:43,653
to play professional football.

420
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,150
And that is true.

421
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:49,800
Luckily, the fine people at Madden NFL 19

422
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,030
agreed to put me in their game.

423
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:55,910
So I met with league player
ratings adjuster, Dustin Smith,

424
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,770
so he could rank my footbally-ness.

425
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:00,220
Dustin, can I call you Dusty?

426
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:02,900
- Uh.

427
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,380
- Dusty?
(audience laughs)

428
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,870
What's considered a good score?

429
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:07,120
What's the scale here?

430
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,580
- 99's the best.
- Okay.

431
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,700
What type of things are you gonna be

432
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,020
judging me in today, Dusty?

433
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,880
- Strength, speed, throw power,

434
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,300
kick power, kick accuracy,
catching, jumping.

435
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,853
- Is, there's no blood
test today is there?

436
00:17:16,853 --> 00:17:19,053
Because I am high as a kite right now.

437
00:17:19,053 --> 00:17:21,952
Anytime I know I need to use
my knees, I get an epidural.

438
00:17:21,952 --> 00:17:22,830
(audience laughs)

439
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,780
What do you think my rating's gonna be?

440
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,315
- Conservative, 20.

441
00:17:27,315 --> 00:17:28,490
(audience laughs)

442
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,950
- To help me figure
out just where I stand,

443
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,390
we brought in six foot four

444
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:34,573
New York Jets quarterback Sam Darnold.

445
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,770
Sam.
- Sir.

446
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:38,070
- Thanks so much for talking to me today.

447
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:38,903
- Absolutely.

448
00:17:38,903 --> 00:17:39,770
- How old are you?

449
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:40,993
- I am 21 years old.

450
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,293
Yeah.

451
00:17:43,293 --> 00:17:44,792
(audience laughs)

452
00:17:44,792 --> 00:17:47,920
- And the fact that you are
younger than my oldest child is

453
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,600
in no way depressing to me.

454
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,253
- No, it's not a concern is it?

455
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,640
- Nope, no it's not.

456
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,630
But since you're on the Jets,

457
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,380

458

- [Stephen] Next up, throw under pressure.

492
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:02,669
- [Dustin] Throw under pressure.

493
00:19:02,669 --> 00:19:04,070
- Throw under pressure, see that?

494
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:06,740
You could cut a diamond, all right?

495
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,953
Bring it.
- All right, guys.

496
00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:14,783
(ominous music)
(audience laughs)

497
00:19:14,783 --> 00:19:16,067
- Hi, Stephen.

498
00:19:16,067 --> 00:19:16,900
Stephen, hi.

499
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,000
Stephen, hi.

500
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,609
Nice to meet ya.

501
00:19:19,609 --> 00:19:20,730
This is a comedy show.

502
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:21,630
Obviously you guys

503
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,446
were told that this is a comedy show?

504
00:19:24,446 --> 00:19:25,321
(audience laughs)

505
00:19:25,321 --> 00:19:26,400
Good, good.

506

508
00:19:29,977 --> 00:19:31,750
- [Dustin] That's gotta
be like, the worst.

509
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,280
- 18, what the (bleep)?

510
00:19:35,433 --> 00:19:38,210
I don't think Dustin's
giving me a fair shake.

511
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,043
I mean...

512
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:45,030
I'm a 54 year old man.

513

(audience laughs)

519
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,240
Promise me.

520
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,380
Back on the field, 'cause
it's time for speed.

521
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,870
Just when you're ready to
go, just yell juice it!

522
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,117
- [Dustin] Juice it, you got it.

523
00:20:10,117 --> 00:20:11,170
- I'm just trying to determine

524
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,240
which knee I want to pop first.

525
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,277
(audience laughs)
- Juice it!

526
00:20:15,277 --> 00:20:18,158

529

- Look at that.

530
00:20:26,148 --> 00:20:26,981
- Woo!

531
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,253
Then my juke move.

532
00:20:30,873 --> 00:20:33,513
I gonna juke ya, watch out!

533
00:20:33,513 --> 00:20:35,180
Watch out, woo, woo!

534
00:20:36,015 --> 00:20:37,682
Here we go, woo wah!

535

And finally, trucking.

536
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:43,863
- [Dustin] I'm gonna need you to

537
00:20:43,863 --> 00:20:45,240
knock over one of these big fellas,

538
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,323
and you stay on your feet and keep going.

539
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:50,873
(audience laughs)

540
00:20:50,873 --> 00:20:52,351
- Hut!

541
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,335

542
00:20:54,335 --> 00:20:57,168

(audience applauds)

545
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,883
Time for my final rating.

546
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:19,640
What is my player rating,

547
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,280
and the important thing is
that I need to really know.

548
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,190
This is important, this is on television.

549
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,340
You have to tell me the truth,

550
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,040
and don't worry about my feelings.

551
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,090
I have a successful career,
I have a beautiful wife,

552
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,743
I have wonderful children.

553
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,500
Just be honest, it's important that I,

554
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,788
I know what the truth is,

555
00:21:37,788 --> 00:21:38,990
and you're not gonna hurt my feelings.

556
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:42,308
- Okay, so officially, 19 overall.

557
00:21:42,308 --> 00:21:43,141
(audience laughs)

558

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,800
I switched to an activity I excel at.

560
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,710
Sitting in a chair.

561

To create my digital player,
certified EA nerd Ben Haumiller

562
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:55,970
entered my test results.

563
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:59,370
Speed, strength, agility.

564
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:01,080
What has he got me for elusiveness?

565
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,380
- [Ben] 47.

566
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,010
- I could be way more elusive than that.

567
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:06,050
You wanna, I'll show you
how elusive I can be.

568
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:08,170
- Okay.
- Tell me you love me.

569
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,003
- I love you.

570
00:22:10,207 --> 00:22:11,567
- God I don't deserve you.

571
00:22:11,567 --> 00:22:14,320
(audience laughs)

572
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,090
See, you have no idea
whether I love you or not.

573
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:16,923
- I don't.

574
00:22:16,923 --> 00:22:20,830
- Yet, I haven't said anything bad, okay?

575
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,122
That's elusive.

576
00:22:22,122 --> 00:22:23,170
(audience laughs)

577
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:25,220
Okay let's take a look at me, here we go!

578
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,883
Okay that looks like me.

579
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:30,670
Let's do-ee.

580
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:31,810
Oh good, I'm wearing glasses.

581
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,463
So few football players do.

582
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,450
Is there any way to take this uniform off?

583
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:37,520
'Cause I've never seen me

584
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,530
with anything approaching a male physique.

585
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:41,360
- We are an E for everyone game.

586
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,950
- Okay.
- So.

587
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,110
Actually would you like to run a play?

588
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:44,943
- Sure.

589
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,110
There I am, as a quarterback,

590
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,370
and I already have a penalty.

591
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:50,760
What the hell just happened?

592
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,200
What did I do?

593
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,350
- [Ben] You're not happy
as the coach, either.

594
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,870
- [Stephen] Yep, how old
do you, wait a second.

595
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,850
How old did you make me as the coach?

596
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:57,967
- [Ben] Oh come on, you're
smoothed out right there.

597
00:22:57,967 --> 00:22:58,800
You're looking all right.

598
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,020
- [Stephen] You look
like you carved my head

599
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:03,190
out of an apple core and
let it dry in the sun.

600
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,513
Good god, man.

601
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,153
- [Man] Here we go now!

602
00:23:07,153 --> 00:23:11,120
- All right, in the pocket, bullet!

603
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,483
And, I suck.

604
00:23:14,343 --> 00:23:15,176
I suck in real life.

605
00:23:15,176 --> 00:23:16,610
Why would I want to suck in a game?

606
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:18,300
Look, even I'm mad at me.

607
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,613
I agree with that guy.

608
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:23,220
Now Ben.
- Yes?

609
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,041
- This is all just zeroes and ones, right?

610
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:26,470
- [Ben] Mhmm.

611
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:30,540
- Well what if I gave you a one

612
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,210
with two zeroes behind it,

613
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:36,323
would that help change my profile?

614
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,340
- I like this.
- Thank you.

615
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,260
With that and just a few clicks,

616
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,310
Ben pumped up all of my stats

617
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:45,720
and gave me a tight end.

618
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,978
Oh yeah.

00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:47,080
because I have a, and
this is a confession.

821
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,840
I have a very disproportionate body.

822
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,150
When I was 14 years old,

823
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:55,270
I had a massive growth spurt, massive.

824
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:56,720
I am six feet four.

825
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,280
I became, I went from being a kid

826
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,830
to six feet four overnight,
literally overnight.

827
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:03,430
What happened is my legs
grew and grew and grew,

828
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:05,151
and my torso never did.

829
00:32:05,151 --> 00:32:06,350
(audience laughs)

830
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:09,460
I have the legs, the legs of an NBA center

831
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,574
and I have the torso of a little girl.

832
00:32:11,574 --> 00:32:13,360
(audience laughs)

833
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,694
And you know what?

834
00:32:14,694 --> 00:32:15,527
She's not even a healthy little girl.

835
00:32:15,527 --> 00:32:18,330
She was born in the
1840s, her name's Molly,

836
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:21,390
and she has rickets.
(audience laughs)

837
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:23,414
- We actually have, we have
an image of your torso.

838
00:32:23,414 --> 00:32:24,247
- Oh that's great, thank you very much.

839
00:32:24,247 --> 00:32:25,340
That's my torso right there.

840
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:29,030
That was from a long
time ago, yeah thanks.

841
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,237
- Right there.
- Thanks for showing that!

842
00:32:30,237 --> 00:32:31,657
- You look fine.
- Thank you.

843
00:32:31,657 --> 00:32:32,970
- You look fine.
- That's funny.

844
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:34,770
No one mentioned you'd
be showing that photo.

845
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:35,770
(audience laughs)

846
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:37,440
- Keep up the B-12.
- Yeah.

847
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,050
But it is, I have and so
I have very very long legs

848
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:43,490
and then this tiny little torso

849
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:46,320
that sits atop the, and
people think I'm exaggerating,

850
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,469
but I can prove to you that I am not, no.

851
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:52,670
(audience cheers)

852
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,503
Look at this.

853
00:32:53,503 --> 00:32:54,633
This.

854
00:32:54,633 --> 00:32:57,700
(audience cheers)

855
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,287
This is my natural.

856
00:32:59,287 --> 00:33:02,120
(audience cheers)

857
00:33:04,737 --> 00:33:06,230
And look, Stephen.
- Yes?

858
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:09,486
- I look like a shorebird
avoiding an oil spill, don't I?

859
00:33:09,486 --> 00:33:11,290
(audience laughs)

860
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:12,170
It's just a freak show,

861
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:14,850
and then I have this
little R2-D2 body on top.

862
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:16,349
(audience laughs)

863
00:33:16,349 --> 00:33:18,960
(beeping noises)

864
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,517
It's a freak show, it's a freak show

865
00:33:20,517 --> 00:33:21,671
and it's caused me--

866
00:33:21,671 --> 00:33:22,504
(audience cheers)
- It is.

867
00:33:23,727 --> 00:33:25,630
- And I have--

868
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:27,120
- No photographs, no papier-mache.

869
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,610
He is alive.

870
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:30,188
- He's alive, he's alive!

871
00:33:30,188 --> 00:33:31,220
(audience laughs)

872
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,800
And my pants, I'm always
pushing them down.

873
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,500
They're pushed down now.

874
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,770
They are artificially pushed down.

875
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:39,013
My penis is here.

876
00:33:39,013 --> 00:33:41,846
(audience laughs)

877
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:49,119
When I use a urinal, I
have to flip the tie back.

878
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:52,320
(audience laughs)

879
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,638
Unbutton two buttons, ladies, not one.

880
00:33:54,638 --> 00:33:56,120
(audience laughs)

881
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,160
Lean down, take care of business.

882
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,980
- Sure, sure, sure.

883
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,740
- It's a bad scene, man.

884
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,233
A real bad scene.

885
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,330
- So no more suits, so no more suits.

886
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:08,300
- You break it up a little bit.

887
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:11,750
I realized I just undid all
the good I'm trying to do

888
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,430
by displaying my body, but yeah.

889
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:15,930
It's been a source of great shame for me,

890
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:16,763
and I want other kids out there--

891
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,800
- I'm glad, I'm glad, I'm glad.

892
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,970
- You're glad that I feel shame?

893
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:22,360
- Yes, a little shame is a good thing.

894
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,860
- It's a very good thing.

895
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:26,740
- After, 25 years on the air.

896
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,520
The show has changed.

897
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:32,330
What else have you learned
about yourself over the years?

898
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:35,430
Because certainly you, when
you do one of these shows

899
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:36,347
you learn what you're capable of,

900
00:34:36,347 --> 00:34:38,770
but then you find out things

901
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:40,210
about yourself that you never knew.

902
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:43,260
- Yes, I found out, and this
isn't even through the show.

903
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,350
This is just life as you go on in life,

904
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:48,110
when I started my show
I had just turned 30.

905
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,560
I didn't know who I was yet.

906
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:53,460
I've grown up and become sort of a man.

907
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,270
(audience laughs)

908
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:58,298
On television over this last 25 years,

909
00:34:58,298 --> 00:35:00,440
but I'm finding out new
things all the time.

910
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,362
I found out, I went to go see my doctor

911
00:35:02,362 --> 00:35:04,136
a couple of months ago,

912
00:35:04,136 --> 00:35:06,450
and just for a physical.

913
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:09,257
He was doing the physical, and he said

914
00:35:09,257 --> 00:35:12,607
"By the way Conan, I don't
know if you're into this,

915
00:35:12,607 --> 00:35:15,697
"but I do DNA testing,
I'm very good at it.

916
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:17,650
"We could find out about your heritage."

917
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:19,450
I think some people
have done that 23andMe.

918
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,320
I said, sure, let's do it.

919
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,580
So he took a DNA sample,

920
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:27,760
and I left.

921
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,174
Two weeks later, he called me up

922
00:35:29,174 --> 00:35:32,467
and he said, "I've never, ever, ever,

923
00:35:32,467 --> 00:35:34,947
"had a DNA result like this before,

924
00:35:34,947 --> 00:35:36,360
"and I've been doing this for 10 years."

925
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,470
And I said what is it?

926
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:39,367
And he said you are, this is true,

927
00:35:39,367 --> 00:35:42,682
"You are 100% Irish."

928
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,180
(audience laughs)

929
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,263
Now listen, there's more, hold it.

930
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,540
He said you are 100%.

931
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:51,700
He said, "I've never
seen a 100% anything."

932
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,770
He said I've been doing this a lot.

933
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:53,920
I've done it with lots of people.

934
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,550
I've seen 93.5, I've seen 96.1,

935
00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:01,350
I've seen 96, there's no
such, no one is 100% Irish.

936
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:03,100
He said if you go to Ireland,

937
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,330
and I looked it up and it's true,

938
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:06,090
and you get their DNA samples,

939
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:08,240
you will find out that the
most Irish looking people

940
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,720
are like 86% Irish, 94% Irish.

941
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:16,399
The Lucky Charms leprechaun,
true fact, 11% Spanish.

942
00:36:16,399 --> 00:36:19,232
(audience laughs)

943
00:36:20,522 --> 00:36:22,690
I, he said you're 100% and I said,

944
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:23,700
I didn't know what to make of this.

945
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,960
I said, what does it mean?

946
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,557
He said, what does it mean?

947
00:36:26,557 --> 00:36:28,157
It means you're inbred.

948
00:36:28,157 --> 00:36:30,990
(audience laughs)

949
00:36:33,018 --> 00:36:36,518
And he said it, he said it just like that!

950
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:38,950
He said it like that, you're inbred

951
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:40,000
and I was like, what?

952
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,435
I mean, first of all that's very rude,

953
00:36:43,435 --> 00:36:46,330
but then all this stuff
started to make sense

954
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:47,482
to me, you know what I mean?

955
00:36:47,482 --> 00:36:48,315
(audience laughs)

956
00:36:48,315 --> 00:36:51,540
Suddenly, everything came together.

957
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,640
(audience cheers)

958
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,813
- Well can I ask,

959
00:36:55,056 --> 00:36:56,058
if you don't mind me asking,

960
00:36:56,058 --> 00:36:58,990
in your generation is your wife Irish?

961
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:00,171
Did you--

962
00:37:00,171 --> 00:37:01,160
- Well here's where it gets crazy, okay?

963
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,940
Because I, you know I looked into it

964
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:06,080
and I found out that the
reason I'm 100% Irish

965
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,790
is that my people, we came to Boston

966
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:09,330
around the time of the Civil War.

967
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:12,210
We just all moved into a very small area,

968
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:14,470
a corner of Worcester, Massachusetts,

969
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:15,350
and we just--
- Woo!

970
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:16,190
- Don't woo Worcester.

971
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:19,910
No one woos Worcester.
(audience laughs)

972
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,413
It's un-wooable, anyway.

973
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:24,520
They moved into a small corner
of Worcester, Massachusetts,

974
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,960
all lived in one house and
married each other for 180 years.

975
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,930
That's what they did,

976
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:32,682
and I realized, and then
I saw that my brothers

977
00:37:32,682 --> 00:37:36,240
were marrying 100% Irish women,

978
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,110
and having kids that look like those kids

979

1138
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:35,253
- Yeah.

1139
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:40,170
But, doing these interviews
sometimes can feel false,

1140
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:41,800
or kind of forced in front of an audience,

1141
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,000
because I know you're being honest

1142
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:43,833
and you're telling me how you really feel,

1143
00:43:43,833 --> 00:43:45,450
but there's an audience here watching us.

1144
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:47,710
- Right, you have to
monitor yourself I think.

1145
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:49,713
- And also there's a little
bit of a performance energy.

1146
00:43:49,713 --> 00:43:50,810
- For sure.
- Putting on a face

1147
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:52,260
for the faces that you meet.

1148
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,895
I'd love to take a moment
just to talk to you

1149
00:43:53,895 --> 00:43:57,580
in a more personal, like a close way,

1150
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:59,010
like in a private space.

1151
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:00,556
- I would really love that.

1152
00:44:00,556 --> 00:44:02,350
(audience laughs)

1153
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:04,470
- Well I'm so glad to hear that.

1154
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:08,131
Join us now in The Late
Show's Personal Space.

1155
00:44:08,131 --> 00:44:10,881
(dramatic music)

1156
00:44:12,412 --> 00:44:13,380
(audience cheers)

1157
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,213
Steve.

1158
00:44:15,073 --> 00:44:17,640
(audience cheers)

1159
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:18,840
Long time viewers will know

1160
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,730
this is The Late Show's Personal Space.

1161
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:25,436
Steve Carell, I'll see you in the box.

1162
00:44:25,436 --> 00:44:28,269
(audience laughs)

1163
00:44:33,393 --> 00:44:36,650
(audience applauds)

1164
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:40,430
We've known each other
for 30 years, right?

1165
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:41,550
1988.

1166
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:43,200
- It's been a long time.
- Yeah.

1167
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:48,300
Honestly Steve, what was
your first impression of me?

1168
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,200
- Well, if I'm completely honest,

1169
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,673
you were very handsome.

1170
00:44:52,673 --> 00:44:53,930
(audience laughs)

1171
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:56,580
You were talented, intelligent,

1172
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:59,030
and there was a certain joie de vivre

1173
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:02,763
that felt like it,

1174
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:07,260
it was just different than
the other guys at Second City.

1175
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,370
- Oh well thanks so much, man.

1176
00:45:09,370 --> 00:45:11,313
- What was your first impression of me?

1177
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:16,753
- He is going to be so
handsome in his late fifties.

1178
00:45:16,753 --> 00:45:18,808
(audience laughs)

1179
00:45:18,808 --> 00:45:20,870
I mean really, that guy's gonna blossom.

1180
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:22,231
- That's so--

1181
00:45:22,231 --> 00:45:23,895
- Why did you wait so long to get sexy?

1182
00:45:23,895 --> 00:45:25,270
(audience laughs)

1183
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:26,170
- You know what?

1184
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:29,431
I just, I just figured it was about time.

1185
00:45:29,431 --> 00:45:30,500
(audience laughs)

1186
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,810
- You are aware that now you are a hot

1187
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:35,633
salt and pepper zaddy, right?

1188
00:45:35,633 --> 00:45:37,111
(audience laughs)

1189
00:45:37,111 --> 00:45:38,753
You have to have heard this, right?

1190
00:45:38,753 --> 00:45:41,586
(audience cheers)

1191
00:45:43,911 --> 00:45:45,792
Can't get out of the box.

1192
00:45:45,792 --> 00:45:47,415
Can't, you're stuck in the box.

1193
00:45:47,415 --> 00:45:48,673
- You're embarrassing me!

1194
00:45:48,673 --> 00:45:51,590
(Stephen chuckles)

1195
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:55,550
- Are you ever sick of people
quoting The Office to you?

1196
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:56,850
- No, I love it.

1197
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:58,193
- That's what she said.

1198
00:45:58,193 --> 00:46:00,092
(audience laughs)

1199
00:46:00,092 --> 00:46:03,092
(audience applauds)

1200
00:46:04,332 --> 00:46:05,415
- Can I admit something to you?

1201
00:46:05,415 --> 00:46:07,213
- Oh you can, it's Personal Space, Steve.

1202
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,867
- The components of both of our breath,

1203
00:46:10,867 --> 00:46:14,050
(audience laughs)

1204
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:15,510
is really warm.

1205
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:17,448
(audience laughs)

1206
00:46:17,448 --> 00:46:19,720
- It is, it is getting
a little steamy in here.

1207
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,840
Would you like, you used to be,

1208
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,071
you're famously a bit of a sweater.

1209
00:46:24,071 --> 00:46:25,980
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1210
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:26,813
Would you?

1211
00:46:26,813 --> 00:46:28,273
- It's happening.

1212
00:46:28,273 --> 00:46:29,180
(audience laughs)

1213
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:31,650
- It is, it is, would you like a fan?

1214
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:33,283
- Sure, do you have a fan?

1215
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:37,224
(audience laughs)

1216
00:46:40,508 --> 00:46:42,045
- How's that feel?

1217
00:46:42,045 --> 00:46:43,704
- That's--
- Is that good?

1218
00:46:43,704 --> 00:46:46,790
- That's actually a lot better.

1219
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:50,247
- That is really dangerously
close to my right eyeball.

1220
00:46:50,247 --> 00:46:51,920
(audience laughs)

1221
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,550
- Is that a rubber tipped fan?

1222
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:56,250
- Let's find out.
- Let me check.

1223
00:47:00,866 --> 00:47:02,760
(audience laughs)

1224
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,230
Ah.

1225
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:05,513
- Yes, yes.

1226
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:10,333
Would you, would you like a mint?

1227
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,440
- I would like a mint.

1228
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,602
Oh!

1229
00:47:14,602 --> 00:47:17,359
(audience laughs)

1230
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:20,192
(audience cheers)

1231
00:47:24,297 --> 00:47:25,464
I have a feel,

1232
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,838
I have a feeling that this
is going to be a meme.

1233
00:47:29,838 --> 00:47:32,671
(audience laughs)

1234
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:36,240
Maybe we shouldn't do that anymore.

1235
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,497
- Okay.

1236
00:47:37,497 --> 00:47:40,330
(audience laughs)

1237
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:45,790
- It really is, it's
really good to see you.

1238
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:47,540
- It really is good to see you too.

1239
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,170
Can I ask you a question,
and I want you to be honest.

1240
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:52,150
- Sure.

1241
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:53,370
- I mean it when I was joking before,

1242
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:54,770
but you really, you look fantastic.

1243
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:59,450
You have just aged like just
a fragrant cheese, and--

1244
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:00,320
- Thank you.

1245
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,090
- You look fantastic.

1246
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:02,923
Do I,

1247
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,860
do I look old to you?

1248
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:07,693
- Do you look old?

1249
00:48:07,693 --> 00:48:08,970
No, you look fantastic too.

1250
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:09,803
- Steve.

1251
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:11,630
- You look exactly--
- Steve, Steve,

1252
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:13,300
you're not gonna hurt my feelings.

1253
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:14,693
Just be honest.

1254
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:17,374
It's important to me.

1255
00:48:17,374 --> 00:48:18,420
You're not gonna hurt my feelings.

1256
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:19,843
- Okay, I'll be honest.

1257
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:22,617
You do look great.

1258
00:48:22,617 --> 00:48:25,017
(audience laughs)

1259
00:48:25,017 --> 00:48:28,130
(audience cheers)

1260
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:29,630
- Why did you switch to drama?

1261
00:48:30,976 --> 00:48:34,160
You are one of the funniest people I know.

1262
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,693
You can make anything funny.

1263
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:38,350
Why did you, is it,

1264
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:41,220
why did you become a dramatic actor?

1265
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:44,660
- All I want is to be respected,

1266
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:46,480
and to be pretentious.

1267
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,380
(audience laughs)

1268
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:50,976
- You're halfway there.

1269
00:48:50,976 --> 00:48:52,934
(audience laughs)

1270
00:48:52,934 --> 00:48:55,820
(audience cheers)

1271
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:56,730
Steve Carell everybody!

1272
00:48:56,730 --> 00:48:58,295
We'll be right back!

1273
00:48:58,295 --> 00:49:03,295
(upbeat music)
(audience cheers)

1274
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:07,560
- I wanted more from my COPD medicine.

1275
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:08,900
That's why I've got the power of

1276
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:11,660
one, two, three medicines with Trelegy.

1277
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:14,822
The only FDA approved
three-in-one COPD treatment.

1278
00:49:14,822 --> 00:49:16,358
♪ Trelegy ♪

1279
00:49:16,358 --> 00:49:18,699
♪ The power of one two three ♪

1280
00:49:18,699 --> 00:49:19,702
♪ Trelegy ♪

1281
00:49:19,702 --> 00:49:20,838
♪ One two three ♪

1282
00:49:20,838 --> 00:49:21,671
♪ Trelegy ♪

1283
00:49:21,671 --> 00:49:24,300
- With Trelegy and the
power of one, two, three

1284
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:25,460
I'm breathing better.

1285
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:26,950
Trelegy works three ways.

1286
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:28,930
To open airways, keep them open,

1287
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:32,090
and reduce inflammation for
24 hours for better breathing.

1288
00:49:32,090 --> 00:49:33,870
- [Narrator] Trelegy won't
replace a rescue inhaler

1289
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:35,121
for sudden breathing problems.

1290
00:49:35,121 --> 00:49:36,970
Trelegy is not for asthma.

1291
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:38,730
Tell your doctor if you
have a heart condition,

1292
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:40,510
or high blood pressure before taking it.

1293
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:42,580
Do not take Trelegy more than prescribed.

1294
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:43,960
Trelegy may increase your risk of

1295
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:46,330
thrush, pneumonia, and osteoporosis.

1296
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:48,000
Call your doctor if worsened breathing,

1297
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,840
chest pain, mouth or tongue swelling,

1298
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,670
problems urinating, vision
changes, or eye pain occur.

1299
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:54,870
- Think your COPD
medicine is doing enough?
