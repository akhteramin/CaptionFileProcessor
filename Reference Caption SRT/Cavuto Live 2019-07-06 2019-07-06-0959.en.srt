1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,580
- Taste like?
- It's actually really good!

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:02,413
- Is it good?
- I mean--

3
00:00:02,413 --> 00:00:04,159
- Does it taste like meat? (laughs)

4
00:00:04,159 --> 00:00:05,430
- Not really, more bourbon.

5
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:06,263
- You know what--
- Tastes like bourbon!

6
00:00:06,263 --> 00:00:07,096
- You really taste the bourbon--

7
00:00:07,096 --> 00:00:08,219
- So it's got bits of steak--
- It's dominant.

8
00:00:08,219 --> 00:00:09,131
And bourbon is good.
- Bits of steak.

9
00:00:09,131 --> 00:00:10,440
Swirled bourbon caramel--
- Me likey!

10
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,760
- Char seasoning in
there, so if you like meat

11
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,411
and if you like ice cream--
- They have a little bacon

12
00:00:14,411 --> 00:00:16,061
on top as well.
- It's a stupid thing, man!

13
00:00:16,061 --> 00:00:17,200
- And Ed, thank you for
his marvelous t-shirt--

14
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,857
- I love it!
- Such a great gift.

15
00:00:18,857 --> 00:00:20,297
"World war, win, repeat,

16
00:00:20,297 --> 00:00:21,483
America."
- America.

17
00:00:21,483 --> 00:00:22,960
Come on, join us tomorrow--
- Happy weekend!

18
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,793
See you tomorrow!
- We're gonna have

19
00:00:23,793 --> 00:00:25,230
a lot of fun.
- See ya tomorrow!

20
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,790
(crowd cheers)

21
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,373
(upbeat music)

22
00:00:32,777 --> 00:00:34,607
(dramatic music)

23
00:00:34,607 --> 00:00:35,711
- [Woman] Get under the
table, get under the table!

24
00:00:35,711 --> 00:00:37,310
- Oh (bleep)!
- Oh, my God!

25
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:38,680
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

26
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,189
- [Woman] Oh, my God!

27
00:00:40,189 --> 00:00:41,740
- It's happened again, California bracing

28
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,560
with a second earthquake
striking foundations

29
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,550
and roads cracking, fires erupting

30
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,370
and now the fear another
one could be coming

31
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,890
as California Governor Gavin
Newsome declares a state

32
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,830
of emergency in San Bernardino County.

33
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,060
Welcome, everybody, happy weekend,

34
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,870
I'm Neil Cavuto and you're looking live

35
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,040
at Los Angeles International Airport,

36
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,570
where all is calm right now

37
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,550
after a second quake in
as many days strikes north

38
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,060
of the major city, near
Ridgecrest, California

39
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,960
where the first one epicentered.

40
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,470
That's where you'll find our Jeff Paul,

41
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:13,380
in the middle of it all.

42
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,463
Jeff, how are things there now?

43
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,930
- Yeah, Neil, I would say
there's a general feeling

44
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,310
of uneasiness.

45
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:24,370
Two days, two big, massive earthquakes,

46
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:27,600
right here, near this town in California

47
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,050
and this latest one, a magnitude 7.1.

48
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,270
It is followed by several aftershocks,

49
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,970
within just the last few minutes or so

50
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,670
while we were waiting to speak with you,

51
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:40,510
we felt several of them
out here at city hall.

52
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:43,580
And that uneasiness is
leading towards many people

53
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,330
just not wanting to sleep
inside their house last night.

54
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,250
In fact, we caught up
with one sheriff's deputy

55
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,890
who told us, while they
were out patrolling,

56
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,190
going street-by-street to
make sure people were okay

57
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,210
and accounted for,

58
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,250
he saw a lot of people
either sleeping outside

59
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,810
or coming here to city hall,

60
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,730
where there is a shelter set up.

61
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,070
Now I want to go to a moment here,

62
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,930
maybe we can pull up the
actual sound on this,

63
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,210
this was the moment we
were at a restaurant.

64
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,710
We started to feel the
rumbling, the violent shaking

65
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,934
and this is what happened right
after that, take a listen.

66
00:02:11,934 --> 00:02:14,430
(metal clanging)
(people exclaiming)

67
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:17,097
(women scream)

68
00:02:17,097 --> 00:02:18,347
- [Man] Go, go!

69
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:21,520
- Get out!
- Keep walkin', keep walkin'!

70
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,422
- Everybody out.
- Go, go!

71
00:02:22,422 --> 00:02:24,232
- Go, go!
- Keep walkin'!

72
00:02:24,232 --> 00:02:25,510
- [Man] Come one, come on, go!

73
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,840
- Yeah, you could really hear
the panic on people's voices.

74
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,670
This again, was a restaurant
right here in Ridgecrest

75
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:35,280
and there was a slight
aftershock before this

76
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,590
and everyone sort of, they'd
been through a few of 'em

77
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,690
in the last day.

78
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,000
But then this next one, the 7.1,

79
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,460
the whole building was shaking,

80
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,010
dishes were crashing on the ground

81
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,540
and you could see some
of the people out there,

82
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,020
just walking out in disbelief,

83
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,240
some people hitting the
ground, coming to tears.

84
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,410
And shortly after walking
out of this restaurant

85
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,960
and collecting ourselves, we
look off into the distance

86
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,120
and we see a huge plume of smoke.

87
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,830
We get closer and realize
that this house is on fire

88
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:04,070
and we do know that this
is at least one house

89
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,990
that was set on fire.

90
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:09,220
A lot of these fires start
because of ruptured gas lines.

91
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,140
Incredibly, we're only
hearing of some minor injuries

92
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,630
due to broken glass or
things falling on people,

93
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,990
no reports of any deaths,

94
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,630
but the governor here has
declared a state of emergency

95
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,050
and has requested a
presidential declaration

96
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:25,960
for some help out here from
the Federal Government.

97
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,160
So far, the President hasn't Tweeted about

98
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,070
what's happened here lately in California.

99
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:31,903
Neil.

100
00:03:31,903 --> 00:03:33,140
- All right, Jeff, thank
you very, very much

101
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:33,973
and as Jeff pointed out,

102
00:03:33,973 --> 00:03:35,690
the California Governor Gavin Newsome has

103
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,830
already declared a state of emergency

104
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,370
in at least San Bernardino County

105
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,880
as officials assess the
damage, brace for more.

106
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,110
And that's what has
everyone on tenterhooks,

107
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,900
what kind of more does that mean?

108
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,960
How much more, how significant?

109
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,340
On the phone with us is
Public Information Officer

110
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,180
from California Governor's
Office of Emergency Services,

111
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,013
Bryan May.

112
00:03:54,013 --> 00:03:55,430
Bryan, thank you for taking the time.

113
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,080
How are things looking there now?

114
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,860
- [Bryan] Well, we've
been working overnight

115
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,580
since this second earthquake
happened yesterday evening.

116
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,680
Unfortunately for us,

117
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,960
that second earthquake
happened right before sunset,

118
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,810
darkness prevented us from being able

119
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,620
to do a lot of assessment overnight.

120
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,530
We've just had sunrise here in California

121
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,150
in the last hour or so, so
right now is crucial for us,

122
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,030
as we're getting into Ridgecrest

123
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:18,190
and into the affected areas,

124
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,730
to see what kind of damage
we're talking about.

125
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,110
Injuries, we've heard there are some,

126
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,610
but we're not quite sure how much.

127
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,580
And of course you heard
of people who don't want

128
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,950
to go inside their homes right now.

129
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,580
We need to get in and
see what the needs are

130
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,750
so that we can meet those needs.

131
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,485
- [Neil] Now blessedly,
we've not heard any reports

132
00:04:32,485 --> 00:04:36,343
of significant injuries or
worse, is that still the case?

133
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,560
- [Bryan] Yeah, as of this morning,

134
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,360
and we've been having briefings all night,

135
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,640
we've had crews around the clock here

136
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,160
in the emergency operations
center just outside Sacramento,

137
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,760
we haven't heard of any serious injuries.

138
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,970
We do know that there are some,

139
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,470
but not so much how
serious the injuries are,

140
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,690
so that's again, what we've
gotta do this morning.

141
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,640
We know there've been
hospitals that were evacuated

142
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,750
and as you saw, some of the power lines

143
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,410
and gas lines that are been broken,

144
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,000
so we've gotta get in there today

145
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,300
and find out what we're dealing with.

146
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,780
- [Neil] You know these
aftershocks are more significant

147
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,090
than the main event by a
factor of up to 10 times

148
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,630
and I'm wondering how unusual is that

149
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,730
for Californians who are always braced

150
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:17,130
for the possibility of this kind of stuff

151
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:20,570
but not the follow up kind
of stuff they've been seeing?

152
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,000
- [Bryan] Yeah, and I'm
gonna defer to the geologist

153
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,833
that we've been working with,

154
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,870
but in talking with them a
lot over the last 48 hours,

155
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,100
it's not that uncommon.

156
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,700
And now what we're seeing is
that the initial earthquake

157
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,630
that we saw wasn't now
considered the main earthquake,

158
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,430
that was now called a foreshock

159
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,980
because the bigger the earthquake,

160
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,420
that becomes the main one.

161
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,540
So now this 7.1, that
happened yesterday evening,

162
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,570
is the main earthquake
and the one that we felt

163
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:47,720
on the Fourth of July is now
being called a foreshock.

164
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,240
Again, not that uncommon if you talk

165
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,090
to the geologists that cover these things.

166
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,300
- [Neil] You know,
Bryan, I'm just curious,

167
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,810
we get these anecdotal reports,

168
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,050
I don't know how rampant they are,

169
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,820
a lot of folks afraid
to sleep in their homes

170
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,200
so they're sleeping out on their driveway

171
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,033
or they're sleeping outside,
they're that anxious.

172
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,290
How widespread is that?

173
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,663
- [Bryan] Well, and I haven't been (sighs)

174
00:06:07,663 --> 00:06:10,630
in Ridgecrest yet today,
but I don't blame them.

175
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,590
This has been goin' on for 48 hours now

176
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,830
and the shaking has been
very violent at times,

177
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:17,010
so people wanna be outside where they feel

178
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,540
at least a little bit safer.

179
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,640
And the problem is,
what we have learned is

180
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,690
that we can't predict earthquakes,

181
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,720
we can't predict when the
next one's going to happen.

182
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,930
We can try and give an advance warning,

183
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:29,663
but in that case, even
seconds is a good warning.

184
00:06:31,221 --> 00:06:32,530
If there's a train
running through the area,

185
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,840
we can slow the train
down, maybe stop elevators,

186
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,160
but we don't have a
system that can predict,

187
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,020
from minutes away, when an
earthquake is going to happen.

188
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,260
- Bryan, thank you for taking the time.

189
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,970
I know you've probably
had little, if any, sleep,

190
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,650
so we appreciate your
calling in and updating us.

191
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:50,760
Bryan May with the Governor's
Office of Emergency Services.

192
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,160
Well, the President, by the
way, was briefed on all of this,

193
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,690
especially this morning with the updates

194
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:57,420
on that 7.1 magnitude earthquake.

195
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,690
Ellison Barber is right
now with the President

196
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:00,720
at Berkeley Heights,

197
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,010
where the Commander in Chief
is spending the weekend.

198
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:04,843
Ellison.

199
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,220
- Hey, Neil, yeah, the White House says

200
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,890
that President Trump was
briefed on the latest earthquake

201
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,510
in California overnight.

202
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,570
Around 1:00 a.m., the White House said

203
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:18,200
that they had teams closely
monitoring the situation

204
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,033
there in California

205
00:07:19,033 --> 00:07:21,390
and said that they would
be providing updates

206
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,270
to the President throughout the night.

207
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,590
President Trump is in New
Jersey for the weekend,

208
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,250
staying at his golf club in Bedminster

209
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,010
and as of this morning,
Tweeting about immigration,

210
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,960
former Vice President Joe
Biden and the economy.

211
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,040
The Department of Labor
says the U.S. economy added

212
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,810
224,000 jobs in June,

213
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:41,293
that is up from 72,000 in May.

214
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:45,200
- Our country continues to do really well,

215
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,920
really, really well.

216
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,240
So we're very happy about it,

217
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,810
I think we're gonna be breaking records.

218
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,370
If we had a Fed that would
lower our interests rates,

219
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,033
we'd be like a rocket ship.

220
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,410
- President Trump
continued those critiques

221
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:02,940
of the Federal Reserve on
Twitter late last night,

222
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,317
writing, "Other countries
around the world are doing

223
00:08:05,317 --> 00:08:08,717
"anything possible to take
advantage of the United States,

224
00:08:08,717 --> 00:08:11,890
"knowing that our Federal
Reserve does not have a clue!"

225
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,217
He went on to Tweet that, "The
U.S.' most difficult problem

226
00:08:14,217 --> 00:08:17,830
"is not our competitors,
but the Federal Reserve."

227
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,350
The President has come
under fire for his attacks

228
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:23,340
on the Federal Reserve and
the chairman, Jerome Powell,

229
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,680
for the last year.

230
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,960
The President has pretty
aggressively criticized

231
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,300
and repeatedly gone after
the Fed and the chairman.

232
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,390
He's criticized the Fed
for raising interest rates

233
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,510
and in the President's view,

234
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:38,360
not doing enough to help the U.S. economy.

235
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,380
Jay Powell has emphasized
that the Fed is independent

236
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,213
and earlier this year,

237
00:08:42,213 --> 00:08:45,230
when asked about President
Trump's frequent criticisms,

238
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,700
Powell told reporters the Fed would

239
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,330
never take political
considerations into account

240
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,910
or discuss them as part of their work.

241
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,720
He said that their priority is working

242
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,510
for the American people.

243
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,343
Neil.

244
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,620
- Ellison, thank you very, very much.

245
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,140
Ellison Barber with the
President in New Jersey.

246
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,450
Meanwhile, with a strong
jobs report like that,

247
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,670
it is kinda tough to make the case

248
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,720
that the economy is just tanking.

249
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,070
So what do Democratic candidates
do in light of this report?

250
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:12,903
After this.

251
00:09:17,626 --> 00:09:19,546

272
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,470
- [Jonathan] Hi, I'm Jonathan Greenhut,

273
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,180
the CEO of Plexaderm.

274
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,350
We've created the best offer yet

275
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,790
with our Plexaderm 10 minute challenge.

276
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:04,240
All it takes is 10 minutes
to reduce the appearance.

277
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,790
Of under-eye bags,
wrinkles and crow's feet.

278
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,450
Plexaderm works so well, makeup artists

279
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,620
and even people across the country look

280
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,750
and feel years younger in minutes.

281
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,560
- Hi, guys, my name is Sandy Marenesi,

282
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,540
I'm a professional hair and makeup artist

283
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,930
and one of the number one
question that I always get

284
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:23,330
in my chair is, "Can you
make me look younger?"

285
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,107
Now I could really say to people,

286
00:10:25,107 --> 00:10:26,920
"Yes, I can make you look younger."

287
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:31,030
- My name is Robin and this
is what Plexaderm does for me.

288
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,180
- [Announcer] The instant results are

289
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,770

silicates found in shell rock.

290
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:37,170

the number on your screen.

295
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,060
- Every time I smiled,
I had to cover my mouth

296
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,750
because I was so ashamed.

297
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:55,130
When the denture slipped, I
would have to excuse myself

298
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,130
and go to the restroom,
virtually in tears.

299
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,540
It kept me from being
able to speak properly.

300
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,810
I could not eat corn,
apples, baby back ribs.

301
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:05,450
I did not want dentures
to be part of my life.

302
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:08,520
I pretty much decided dental
implants were the route

303
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,510
I was gonna take.

304
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,290
- Let's do a head-to-head comparison

305
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:14,010
of dental implants versus dentures.

306
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:17,590
With dentures, the ability to taste food,

307
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,830
to bite and chew is altered.

308
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:22,950
The worst thing about dentures, bone loss.

309
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,490
When you put an implant inside the bone,

310
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,270
which is like the root of a tooth,

311
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,220
now you've preserved the
bone, it's a game changer.

312
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,010
With implants, you walk into a restaurant,

313
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,300
you order anything you want.

314
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,750
You eat just like you have real teeth.

315
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:39,150
- Before you knew it, here I
was with my brand new teeth.

320
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,020

00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,450
before she puts them in the dishwasher.

322
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,150
So what does the dishwasher do?

00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,081
- (laughs) Yeah, the only
catch is I'm never leaving.

332
00:12:12,081 --> 00:12:12,914
(friend laughs)

333
00:12:12,914 --> 00:12:14,690
No, I'm serious I live here now.

334
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:17,340
Book at hilton.com and get
the price match guarantee.

335
00:12:18,491 --> 00:12:19,510
(dramatic music)

336
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:22,360
- And our economy is much
better than it's ever been.

337
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:27,360
From election day, we're over 50% increase

338
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,220
and we've made trillions
and trillions of dollars,

339
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,393
with a T, trillions.

340
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,700
- All right, that 50% increase

341
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,850
to which the President was referring

342
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,780
is the Dow Jones Industrial
surging about that

343
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,090
since he was first elected.

344
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,720
The President saying he's
a big reason for that

345
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,990
and optimism ahead of his inauguration

346
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:47,060
and what he's done since the inauguration

347
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,470
have made the changes
in a booming jobs report

348
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,080
that few people saw coming.

349
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,540
So for 2020 Democrats who
are portraying an economy

350
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:58,230
that isn't nearly as robust as
the numbers seem to indicate,

351
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,500
what do they do?

352
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,580
All In Together CEO
Lauren Leader is with us.

353
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,870
We got Republican strategist Joseph Pinion

354
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:07,380
and the host of "Sincerely
Kat" on Fox Nation, Kat Timpf.

355
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,920
Kat, end it with you, begin with you

356
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,137
on what the President is saying,

357
00:13:10,137 --> 00:13:13,880
"No denying the numbers, give
me credit for those numbers."

358
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,670
- Right, I think that's the second part

359
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,960
that a lot of people have
a problem with, right.

360
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,610
The economy is doing very
well, that's objectively true

361
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,830
and this was a huge report in particular

362
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:25,720
because it shows that this
U.S.-China trade war hasn't

363
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,400
really affected employment

364
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,700
in this country negatively whatsoever.

365
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,860
But at the same time--
- Yet.

366
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,330
But they all say yet.
- Yet, yet.

367
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,670
As we always say on this show, though,

368
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:37,090
President Trump's approval
rating should be much better,

369
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:39,420
given how well the economy is doing.

370
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,417
So I think with any other
president it would be

371
00:13:41,417 --> 00:13:43,400
and it has been.

372
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,120
We don't know how much
it's going to affect things

373
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,410
and then also at the same time,

374
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,970
polls haven't always
accurately represented just

375
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:54,000
how much support the President
has if you look back to 2016.

376
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,470
So it's really, really hard to say,

377
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,780
but it's gonna be hard for the Democrats

378
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,973
because they can't say that
the economy is a disaster,

379
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:06,400
it's hard to argue against
something that's doing so well.

380
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,710
- Lauren, you couldn't say
the economy is a disaster,

381
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:09,680
right, let's say?

382
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,950
- I just looked at this Gallup Poll

383
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,130
that was taken a couple
a couple of weeks ago

384
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,580
and compared it to a year ago,

385
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,870
which was independent of
asking political questions,

386
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:18,987
just asked Americans, "How
do you view the economy,

387
00:14:18,987 --> 00:14:20,880
"great, good, poor?" et cetera.

388
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,880
46% of Americans still think
the economy is poor or very bad

389
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:28,490
and that's basically the same
number that it was a year ago.

390
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:29,323
And that tells you--
- How was it

391
00:14:29,323 --> 00:14:32,160
under Barack Obama?
- Well, (sighs)

392
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,580
I didn't look at every single year.

393
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,063
I mean, I think, look, the confidence

394
00:14:35,063 --> 00:14:36,373
and it was a different time, obviously,

395
00:14:36,373 --> 00:14:38,773
because we were still
coming out of a recession,

396
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,170
out of the crisis, through
most of the Obama presidency.

397
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:44,123
The point is that I think Kat's right,

398
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,920
it should look like a
better picture than it feels

399
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,980
and I think the impact of the tariffs

400
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,280
on farmers in the Midwest,

401
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,390
I think the ongoing wage
growth is just now beginning

402
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:57,100
to change, it's starting to rise slightly.

403
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,540
But, you know, vast majorities

404
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:02,410
of Americans couldn't manage
a $200 unexpected medical

405
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,020
or emergency.
- But that's been the case

406
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,560
through Democrat and
Republican presidencies.

407
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,690
- Well, I know, but the point is

408
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,440
I think what the Democrats
are gonna do is make a lot

409
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,273
of hay out of that and say,

410
00:15:09,273 --> 00:15:11,817
"Look, if the economy is so
good, why aren't we investing

411
00:15:11,817 --> 00:15:13,867
"back in the working class Americans?

412
00:15:13,867 --> 00:15:15,830
"Why are we not working
to reduce the debt?"

413
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:18,210
talk about the trillions with a T--

414
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,043
- Democrats like--
- I was gonna say--

415
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,590
- Well--
- Democrats lecturing on debt?

416
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,423
- What Democrats have been--
- Many have--

417
00:15:21,423 --> 00:15:22,796
- Talking about the debt?
- Well, where is--

418
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:23,650
- That's like me giving dietary advice.

419
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,325
- It did--
- But having said that--

420
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:26,845
- Look at what they have--
- It's a valid point.

421
00:15:26,845 --> 00:15:27,678
- To deal with!
- All right, but--

422
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:29,434
- The debt has exploded
under this administration.

423
00:15:29,434 --> 00:15:30,267
- Well, it exploded--
- I think they're gonna take

424
00:15:30,267 --> 00:15:31,440
it on.
- Under the prior one.

425
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,110
So any party lecturing the other on debt

426
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,210
I think is a fool's game,

427
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:35,913
but, Joseph, one of
the things I do note is

428
00:15:35,913 --> 00:15:37,810
that the President hasn't really been able

429
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,500
to take advantage of
this, at least in polling

430
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,440
to some of the points that were raised,

431
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,710
is that there are one million

432
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,313
more African-Americans employed

433
00:15:45,313 --> 00:15:47,440
than when Barack Obama left office,

434
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,360
more than two million Hispanics

435
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,500
than when Barack Obama left office.

436
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,270
Yet with those groups,
he's still under water,

437
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,360
why is that?

438
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,430
- I think that realistically,

439
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:59,160
they've just done a bad job
of messaging across the board.

440
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,090
I think they're actually
better served not makin'

441
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,460
it about African-American
employment or Hispanic employment,

442
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,117
but just sayin' that,
"Look, we've got a problem

443
00:16:05,117 --> 00:16:06,227
"with poverty in this country,

444
00:16:06,227 --> 00:16:08,117
"but that problem pre-existed
my administration.

445
00:16:08,117 --> 00:16:10,047
"Having said that, if
Democrats are tellin' ya

446
00:16:10,047 --> 00:16:11,947
"that people are working
two and three jobs,

447
00:16:11,947 --> 00:16:13,297
"they've been working two or three jobs

448
00:16:13,297 --> 00:16:14,130
"this whole time.

449
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,077
"The difference is, those two

450
00:16:15,077 --> 00:16:16,407
"and three jobs are paying more money

451
00:16:16,407 --> 00:16:17,510
"under my administration."

452
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,690
- All right, well--
- But, well--

453
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:21,565
- It's one in 15 who are
working two or more jobs.

454
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:24,300
That's a high number nevertheless,

455
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,750
but it is in this idea that
everybody's working that.

456
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,103
But I--
- And wage growth,

457
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,750
the wage growth is ticking up

458
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,660
as the job growth is ticking up.

459
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,130
Wage growth for African-Americans

460
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:37,300
and Hispanics has not kept pace--

461
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,133
- Well, for lower--
- With the wage growth

462
00:16:38,133 --> 00:16:38,966
for the white Americans.
- And middle income workers

463
00:16:38,966 --> 00:16:39,810
you're actually wrong on that.

464
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:42,390
It's been running at
close to a 3.3 to 3 1/2%--

465
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:45,430
- [Lauren] And it's double that
though for white Americans.

466
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:46,619
- Well, no, no--

467
00:16:46,619 --> 00:16:47,452
- It is!
- I mean.

468
00:16:47,452 --> 00:16:48,285
- I just looked at the numbers--

469
00:16:48,285 --> 00:16:49,118
- Before I walked on.
- The fact of the matter is,

470
00:16:49,118 --> 00:16:50,800
I mean, for upper income,
which tends to be a target

471
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,630
of Democrats, it's been
averaging closer to 3%.

472
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:56,540
No, that's not narrowing the
gap, but it is beginning to.

473
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,860
So what I'm looking at with this is

474
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,960
whether the arguments
that Democrats are raising

475
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,960
on the stump camp is gonna
come back to bite them

476
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,767
because most people look
at this recovery would say,

477
00:17:07,767 --> 00:17:09,590
"I can deal with this."

478
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:12,550
- Right, absolutely and I
think it's gonna be tough.

479
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,140
I think that's why we've seen them focus

480
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,440
on other things such as healthcare,

481
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,320
that's a good thing, I
think, for them to focus on

482
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,390
because obviously Republicans
had a chance to fix that

483
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,160
and that got all messed up.

484
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,010
That's didn't happen,

485
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,550
they didn't have an answer--
- How much of a role does--

486
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,387
- to the problem.
- The President

487
00:17:26,387 --> 00:17:27,220
himself play in this?

488
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,720
I think he stomps on his own--

489
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,020
- I absolutely--
- otherwise good message?

490
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,937
- I absolutely think--
- Tweeting silly stuff,

491
00:17:31,937 --> 00:17:32,940
and he gets away.

492
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,660
- He distracts from the message

493
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,760
of the economy doing so well.

494
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,580
Yes, he talks about it but
then he'll Tweet something

495
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,240
that's all the way out there
or he'll go after somebody,

496
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,410
call someone a loser

497
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,550
and people tend to focus on those things

498
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,820
more than--
- Oh, I can see the Tweets--

499
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,840
- They focus on the economy.
- Coming on you right now.

500
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,740
- I'm a loser, I already know I'm a loser,

501
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,890
so what are ya gonna do?
(Neil laughs)

502
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,990
- All right, one other
thing, Lauren, I look at

503
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,550
when I look at all the data that comes in

504
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,900
and you're right, we get a lot
of it from a lot of angles,

505
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,483
is that in the manufacturing states,

506
00:17:57,483 --> 00:18:00,980
some of the big ones like
Pennsylvania, Michigan, Indiana,

507
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,600
we are talking about wages growing

508
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,350
at a faster clip than
the rest of the nation.

509
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:09,000
Yet, to your point, he is
trailing, that is the President,

510
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,390
by double digits in some of these,

511
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,960
not quite that same amount in Indiana,

512
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,420
but that doesn't jive with these numbers.

513
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,070
- Well, because you have to
look at the whole picture.

514
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,540
Look, at the same time that we've had

515
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,020
this sort of incremental growth in wages,

516
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,340
which I don't deny, it's real

517
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,050
and obviously the growth in jobs,

518
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:25,500
you also have this
explosion of student debt.

519
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,960
So the access to the American
dream has gotten more

520
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,320
and more expensive, it's
weighing down more families,

521
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,930
not just the kids who are going to school,

522
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:33,230
but their parents and their grandparents

523
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,410
who are saddled with debt.

524
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,020
You look at the rising cost of healthcare,

525
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,520
the rising cost of housing,

526
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,460
which the Democrats have
just started talking about.

527
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,220
The cost of living in almost
every metropolitan area

528
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,910
around the--
- Would the government waving

529
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:45,760
a wand to eradicate that debt,

530
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,400
or to deal with Health Care For All,

531
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,620
or to offer benefits to illegals--

532
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,360
- Look, I--
- Do you think

533
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,350
that is enough to turn the tide for now

534
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,380
or do other Americans
look at that and say,

535
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,213
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, cool it."

536
00:18:57,213 --> 00:18:59,650
- Look, I think that the
risk the President runs is

537
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:01,010
this sense that he's tone deaf

538
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,710
to the challenges that working-class

539
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:04,220
and middle-class Americans
are actually facing.

540
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,730
He keeps talkin' about how
amazing the stock market is,

541
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:06,910
well, the vast majority

542
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,820
of working-class folks aren't invested

543
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,300
or benefiting from the stock market,

544
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,820
except maybe for a 401k and those--

545
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,776
- Well, 54% are you're right--
- Okay, so then--

546
00:19:13,776 --> 00:19:15,675
there's another 46%--
- It's down from 60%.

547
00:19:15,675 --> 00:19:16,545
- I mean, we could do the math.

548
00:19:16,545 --> 00:19:17,490
The point is, is that
you continue to only--

549
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,140
- But what about all these numbers

550
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,580
I showed you on minority gains

551
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,413
all of that?
- You have to,

552
00:19:22,413 --> 00:19:24,280
all of the polls that ask Americans,

553
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,220
or working-class Americans, how they feel,

554
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,170
do they feel the sense
that they are benefiting

555
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,194
from this economy, the
answer is no they do not--

556
00:19:30,194 --> 00:19:31,027
- So when the give--
- Because of the--

557
00:19:31,027 --> 00:19:31,860
whole picture.
- The President high marks

558
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,606
on the economy, but overall,
not for him, himself,

559
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:35,439
what does that tell you, Joseph?

560
00:19:35,439 --> 00:19:37,710
- Right, and the Democrats
have an opportunity there

561
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,195
to say, "And I have a solution for that."

562
00:19:39,195 --> 00:19:40,263
But, I mean, that's--
- But it hasn't changed--

563
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:41,096
- Part of why--
- The view

564
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:41,929
that the economy's doing well.

565
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:44,090
- I think the reality is that
the overwhelming majority

566
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,300
of Americans do feel that
the economy is going well.

567
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,210
I think that if you look,

568
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:49,910
again, not everyone is
invested in the stock market,

569
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:52,217
but it's gonna be very
difficult for Democrats to say--

570
00:19:52,217 --> 00:19:54,410
- By the way, that masks
the number who benefit

571
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:57,010
from a higher market, or who see things

572
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:58,940
in their pension funds that are directly,

573
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,955
or indirectly invested.

574
00:19:59,955 --> 00:20:03,110
- Yeah, market confidence
is very much an indicator

575
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:05,470
on how the actual commercial impact

576
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,130
and so I think if you
just take a step back

577
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:08,722
and say the realistic--
- But that's dangerous, right?

578
00:20:08,722 --> 00:20:09,555
- [Lauren] It's huge, yes.

579
00:20:09,555 --> 00:20:10,388
- Constantly quoting the stock market.

580
00:20:10,388 --> 00:20:12,370
Ronald Reagan, of all people
for whom the market boomed,

581
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,194
was very leery.
- It's extremely dangerous.

582
00:20:14,194 --> 00:20:15,570
- Look, I recognize the fact that, again,

583
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:16,677
there are going to be people who says,

584
00:20:16,677 --> 00:20:18,310
"I am not included in this growth,"

585
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:20,410
but I think it's going to
be difficult for Democrats

586
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:21,537
to stand up there and say,

587
00:20:21,537 --> 00:20:24,360
"Your 401k goin' up is a
figment of your imagination."

588
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,350
The extra money--
- But maybe her point--

589
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,183
- You got back--
- About those

590
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,137
who will capitalize on the fact--

591
00:20:27,137 --> 00:20:28,390
- It's a small piece of it.
- That they don't,

592
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,950
maybe on these wedge issues

593
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,910
and what you're doing
on illegal immigrants

594
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:35,629
and Health Care For All, will
register, what do you think?

595
00:20:35,629 --> 00:20:36,462
- Well, I--
- No, I'm saying

596
00:20:36,462 --> 00:20:38,253
it's a bigger picture than
just the stock market.

597
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,470
What their day-to-day lives are--

598
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,250
- But you mention these examples

599
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:45,670
as something that will eek out support

600
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:46,503
where there isn't,

601
00:20:46,503 --> 00:20:47,417
maybe on the general economy.
- Yeah, and look,

602
00:20:47,417 --> 00:20:49,070
the Democrats are gonna have a big stage

603
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,070
for the next six months,

604
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,920
to be dominating endless conversations

605
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,270
about policy solutions for
making American's lives better.

606
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,320
They're gonna own that

607
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,280
and the President is gonna
eventually have to address--

608
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,113
- But they're at a step--
- What is he gonna do with--

609
00:20:58,113 --> 00:20:59,640
- With even Democratic voters

610
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,200
who don't support giving
health benefits to illegals.

611
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,441
- I just think in a binary--
- It's not presented--

612
00:21:03,441 --> 00:21:05,730
- Choice between somebody who
didn't have a job yesterday

613
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,570
and somebody who has a job tomorrow,

614
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:09,050
they're not going to be
able to convince them

615
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,620
that somehow their life is worse off.

616
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,890
I think that people, again,

617
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:14,450
in polls early on are gonna
be talkin' about the emotions,

618
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:16,790
the visceral impact that
Donald Trump's words has

619
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:17,900
on their everyday life.

620
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,430
But I think when you show up in November,

621
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:20,620
when you start doing that polling,

622
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,500
the actual only polling that matter,

623
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,963
which is the exit polling,

624
00:21:22,963 --> 00:21:24,420
I think there's gonna
be much different story.

625
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,253
- So we're just wasting our time

626
00:21:25,253 --> 00:21:26,140
with the polls.
(Joseph laughs)

627
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:26,973
- What are we gonna do--
- I don't know?

628
00:21:26,973 --> 00:21:28,490
- For the next year?
- I don't know.

629
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:30,300
Guys, I'm gonna see ya soon again here.

630
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,397
The President, he mentioned something,

631
00:21:31,397 --> 00:21:33,770
"We've never seen this
kind of strength before,"

632
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,920
then why, Mr. President, are
you urging the Federal Reserve

633
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,900
to cut interest rates?

634
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,160
You don't need to if we're
firing on all the cylinders.

635
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,880
Or is there something I'm missing?

636
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,883
Apparently there is, right after this.

637
00:21:46,034 --> 00:21:47,224

(crowd cheers)

639
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,433
- Hey, who are you?

640
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,740
- Oh, hey, Jeb, I'm a car thief.

641
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,573
- What!

642
00:21:52,573 --> 00:21:55,760
- I'm here to steal your car
because, well, that's my job.

643
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,744
- What!

644
00:21:56,744 --> 00:21:58,253
- What?
- What!

645
00:21:58,253 --> 00:22:00,184
- (laughs) What!
- What!

646
00:22:00,184 --> 00:22:01,694
- What?
(glass shattering)

647
00:22:01,694 --> 00:22:02,850
- What!

648
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:03,753
- (laughs) It happens.

649
00:22:03,753 --> 00:22:05,759
Have you got cut-rate car insurance?

650
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:08,060
Payin' for this could feel
like gettin' robbed twice.

651
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,606
So get Allstate.
(engine revs)

652
00:22:09,606 --> 00:22:10,439
(tires squeal)
And be better protected

wrinkles, tighten saggy skin

658

feel decades, not years,

659
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,490
but decades younger?

660

that sometimes a little

As you might have heard,

736
00:25:11,893 --> 00:25:15,040
a 7.1 magnitude earthquake in the region,

737
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,960
higher by a factor 10 times than the one

738
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,560
that hit just 24 hours earlier.

739
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,890
We're watching this, no
reports of any serious injuries

740
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:26,870
or worse so far, so there is that.

741
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,610
We'll keep ya posted on aftershocks

742
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,770
and obviously a lot of
Californians worried

743
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:33,410
that they could see a lot more of those.

744
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:37,320
In the meantime, the job market
is stronger than all get out

745
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,267
right now, in fact so strong,
it has a lot of folks saying,

746
00:25:40,267 --> 00:25:41,387
"Do we really even need

747
00:25:41,387 --> 00:25:43,747
"to see the Federal
Reserve cut interests rates

748
00:25:43,747 --> 00:25:45,300
"to keep it going?"

749
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,320
And that lands the
conundrum for stock traders

750
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,340
because they sold off
a little bit yesterday

751
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:54,330
from record highs, we reached
before July 4th, the holiday,

752
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:57,180
on the notion that maybe there is no need

753
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,830
to at least immediately cut rates.

754
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,920
Let's get the view from
Gibbs Wealth Management,

755
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,770
Chief Investment Officer, Erin Gibbs,

756
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:05,110
we've got FOX News
Contributor Jonas Max Ferris

757
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:08,180
and our very own FOX Business
Network Deirdre Bolton.

758
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,030
Deirdre, that was sort of the battle back

759
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,570
and forth yesterday, wasn't it?

760
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:15,010
Well, you know, it's
strong and we like that,

761
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:17,110
good news is good news, but it's bad news

762
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:19,450
when it means the Federal
Reserve might have to push off--

763
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:20,770
- Yeah and if we look at--
- A rate cut.

764
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:23,070
- Fed funds futures, so what
traders are anticipating,

765
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:25,110
so it seems as if
everyone, or most people,

766
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:27,570
are still anticipating this cut in July,

767
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:30,934
but the idea of a 50 basis
point cut seems to be--

768
00:26:30,934 --> 00:26:31,870
- That's off the table now--
- Really diminishing.

769
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:34,390
Yeah, it's seems to be not
even really a real possibility,

770
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:36,900
but the 25 basis point is a possibility.

771
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,380
But to your point, do we need at all

772
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,220
and if so, do we need it now,

773
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,950
those are the two outstanding questions.

774
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:45,950
So the market clearly pricing it in,

775
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:47,030
as far as what's coming,

776
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:49,630
I'm gonna bet on the 25 basis point cut--

777
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:51,865
- So we'll still see a cut?
- I believe so.

778
00:26:51,865 --> 00:26:53,130
- [Neil] You think that,
we're gonna still see a cut?

779
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:57,190
- Yeah, because of really
the last big piece of data

780
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,960
that the Fed was getting was last Friday

781
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,480
and because there were a
few things that you weren't

782
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,990
completely thrilled with--
- Like what?

783
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:07,100
- Well, for one, some of the
wage growth started to drop

784
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,070
and even though they--
- Was it 3.1%?

785
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:11,010
- Yeah, so just not quite as strong,

786
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:13,020
so I think those kind of indicators.

787
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,580
There's still a concern
about trade war out there,

788
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,820
I mean, we haven't gotten rid of it,

789
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,690
we're just slowly moving forward.

790
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:23,100
And also Europe, still,
the last time they talked,

791
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:27,020
the big issue was concerns
about a global economic slowdown

792
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,690
and we still have that out there,

793
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,270
so though the U.S. is good.

794
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:33,400
So I think a quarter point is
still very much on the table

795
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,580
for the end of July.

796
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,170
- You know, I always
wondered, Jonas, on this

797
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:39,000
whether you go ahead and cut rates now,

798
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,900
and in our environment,
we have a strong economy,

799
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,400
albeit maybe not as strong as we had,

800
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,520
but you don't have a lot
of arrows in the quiver

801
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,900
so do you waste your time
cutting 'em an environment

802
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,230
as good as this when you might

803
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,820
really need 'em down the road?

804
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,860
- Yeah, it's like in that movie,
"The Fast and the Furious"

805
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,240
when he hit the nitrous too early

806
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,550
and he's like, "You ran outta nitrous!"

807
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,810
The reality--

808
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,335
- I thought the exact same thing!

809
00:28:00,335 --> 00:28:01,340
(group laughs)
Touche.

810
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:04,090
- I think that's psychological
"Wizard of Oz" kind of thing

811
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:05,800
that the Fed does, it's
very important in this.

812
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,530
On just pure inflation terms,

813
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:08,860
they could have lower interest rates,

814
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,910
it would be good to have
the interest rate curve be

815
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:13,870
upward-slanting, so
people aren't concerned

816
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,150
we're gonna have a recession.

817
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,523
That said, if they do that
now and go to 1% or 1.5,

818
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:19,700
and then we do get a recession--

819
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,330
- [Neil] What are we now,
around 2.5, is that it?

820
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:24,464
- Yeah, a little under
with the actual, anyway.

821
00:28:24,464 --> 00:28:25,504
(Neil huffs)

822
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:26,337
- Yes.
- If they do that,

823
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:27,170
then people are gonna be like,

824
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:30,840
wait a second, we're already
recycling the QE money,

825
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,680
we stopped doing that.

826
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,360
We're already now down to 1%.

827
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,540
We've already done tax cuts,

828
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,540
we're not gonna get those again.

829
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:38,060
We're already running a stimulus program,

830
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,420
essentially increase spending.

831
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,880
What are we gonna do now, a little panic,

832
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,440
and the Fed wants to show off
that they've got some tools.

833
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,000
They really don't have that
many tools left at this point,

834
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,880
so they don't wanna--
- It's quantitative easing

835
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,620
and buying all the Treasury
notes and bonds out there.

836
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,190
That was kind of unprecedented

837
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,530
when Bernanke was doing that, right.

838
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:54,510
- Right, and they can't get out of it.

839
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:57,230
I mean, they're trying
to slowly, so slowly,

840
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:59,240
let's let the interest payments be

841
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,530
basically burned, that money.

842
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:03,480
Instead they have to now
go buy more longterm debt,

843
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,280
which is one of the reasons
longer term interest rates fell

844
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,980
so much, besides these fears
that are kinda irrational,

845
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,400
that the economy's slowing,

846
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,260
which kinda gets to the whole thing,

847
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,510
What's going on is, you know,

848
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,430
the market long term is
earnings, economy, all that,

849
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,763
but in the short run, there
was a big bet going on

850
00:29:14,763 --> 00:29:17,740
that the economy's weakening
enough to get the Fed

851
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:20,780
to lower rates, but
actually is not that weak,

852
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,420
so we're gonna get a big
boost in the stock market.

853
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,920
That's what investors were hoping for

854
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,180
and that story changed when

855
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,650
this jobs numbers stood.
- Well, when they say

856
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:29,600
you can't lose, that a good
report will be greeted favorably

857
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,500
as a good report, a bad report
would be greeted favorably

858
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,200
as a reason for the Fed
to ease, that sets you up

859
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,033
for a disappointment.
- That's the idea

860
00:29:37,033 --> 00:29:39,180
where you were saying that
good news is bad news,

861
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,710
bad news is good news.

862
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,100
But I'm seeing more and more, I mean,

863
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,600
when you talk about the tools,

864
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,230
I think the Fed has also decided

865
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:47,500
that by cutting rates
or not cutting rates,

866
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,510
that everyone understands in the market,

867
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:52,360
whereas the QE was very difficult

868
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,830
and there was a bit of hocus pocus.

869
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,850
I mean, I'm sure there was a method--

870
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:55,683
- Well, the President--
- To the madness.

871
00:29:55,683 --> 00:29:56,532
- Was a critic of it.
- Yes.

872
00:29:56,532 --> 00:29:57,365
- What was goin' on under Barack Obama--

873
00:29:57,365 --> 00:29:58,837
- But to me--
- Now he says,

874
00:29:58,837 --> 00:29:59,967
"Do that for me"--
- Right, do that.

875
00:29:59,967 --> 00:30:01,057
- "And we'd be really off to the races."

876
00:30:01,057 --> 00:30:03,010
- Put that special sauce
back in there, please.

877
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,030
- Do think so, that that's the case?

878
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,580
- Yeah, it's definitely something

879
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,530
that could be added back in.

880
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:09,363
But it's--

881
00:30:09,363 --> 00:30:10,196
- [Neil] Do you think
we should add it back?

882
00:30:10,196 --> 00:30:12,590
- No, I think the tightening has been,

883
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:15,940
because they just let it get
so out of hand for so long

884
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,910
and I think just small
quarter-point rate cuts.

885
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:21,910
I think the idea of when we
were thinking about a 50-bip cut

886
00:30:23,076 --> 00:30:26,770
for the July meeting
was a little aggressive.

887
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:29,386
So I think the expectations now seem--

888
00:30:29,386 --> 00:30:30,219
- Yeah, and you more--
- Much more rational.

889
00:30:30,219 --> 00:30:31,370
- And more general press talking even

890
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:32,870
about deflationary worries, right.

891
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,830
To your point, there were
a lot of people saying,

892
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,507
okay, maybe we don't need this now,

893
00:30:36,507 --> 00:30:38,950
but there were definite
arguments being made

894
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:41,500
in Washington Post,
editorials in The Journal,

895
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,300
The Economist, Bloomberg Business Week,

896
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,410
you know, nobody's
saying this is happening,

897
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,880
but saying, okay, should this be,

898
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,600
actually now what we're worried about?

899
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,433
- I just wonder--
- And you could slow down--

900
00:30:49,433 --> 00:30:50,266
- The trade thing, though.

901
00:30:50,266 --> 00:30:51,850
The trade thing holds everything in it.

902
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,890
I always think we haven't
gotten the impact of tariffs yet

903
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:57,080
because a lot of them haven't
reached consumers yet,

904
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,950
because they were in transit and all that.

905
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,710
So obviously, eventually that will happen,

906
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:02,590
we don't know when, but
if they get a trade deal,

907
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,933
all bets are off, right?

908
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:05,663
- You know the funny thing is

909
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:06,860
that we do lower interest rates,

910
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:07,920
or they keep going down,

911
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:11,070
our weakening dollar would have the effect

912
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:13,040
of more than the tariff, actually.

913
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,120
So it would make all imports
from all countries seem more

914
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,660
than five, or 10, or 15% expense.

915
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,370
In fact, I believe the
President was talking about

916
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:21,060
that by having rates too
high, our dollar's too strong.

917
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,480
So he wants to--
- So you cut them.

918
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,885
Weaken them, obviously it would improve--

919
00:31:24,885 --> 00:31:25,718
It would improve--
- Right, 'cause--

920
00:31:25,718 --> 00:31:26,710
- Exporters getting--
- Other countries--

921
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:27,543
- Their goods out--
- Yeah, people

922
00:31:27,543 --> 00:31:29,560
in Germany are very happy
with our 2% 10-year bond

923
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,350
because they have a zero or
negative 10-year bond, so--

924
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:33,340
- Yeah, in Germany, you're actually paying

925
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,780
for the privilege to lend
your money to the government.

926
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,840
I mean, they have negative rates.

927
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,080
- That's incredible, are we going there?

928
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,040
- I don't see us going
anywhere near negative rates.

929
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,990
We're in a much healthier
environment versus Europe.

930
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:45,620
They're really struggling--
- So are you bullish--

931
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,750
- Just to get any growth.
- At this stage?

932
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:47,640
- Yeah, I think--
- We are?

933
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,110
- Yeah, we are, I'm bullish.

934
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,797
But I'm cautious, let's say I'm--

935
00:31:50,797 --> 00:31:52,030
- Cautiously bullish.
- Cautiously optimistic.

936
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:52,863
- [Neil] Jonas?

937
00:31:52,863 --> 00:31:54,767
- We would probably be
at about 1% if we did

938
00:31:54,767 --> 00:31:55,620
and there's two reasons.

939
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,450
We have a stronger economy
with stronger inflation

940
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:59,780
than Europe, but we also borrow much more.

941
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:03,280
We're in a huge, actual budget deficits

942
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,300
that they don't run anymore.

943
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,250
They're running a very
strict, austere program,

944
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,290
they're not borrowing as much as we are.

945
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:09,100
- Yeah, it can boomerang on you.

946
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,300
All right, guys, I know you'll be back.

947
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,780
In the meantime, the battle

948
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,290
between New York Democratic Congresswoman,

949
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:15,960
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
and the border patrol,

950
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:20,220
erupting over new allegations
that this Facebook postings,

951
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,020
that were pretty obnoxious,

952
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,800
there might have been more
of them than we thought

953
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,370
and more involved in
saying what they said.

954
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:27,203
After this.

955
00:32:30,123 --> 00:32:32,890
- With all that USAA offers,
why go with anybody else?

956
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:34,314
We know their rates are good.

957
00:32:34,314 --> 00:32:36,030
We know that they're always
gonna take care of us.

958
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,130
- It was an instant savings

959
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:38,800
and I should have changed a long time ago.

960
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,410
- We're the Tenneys and
we're USAA members for life.

961
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:44,960
- [Announcer] Call USAA to
start saving on insurance today.

962
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,793
- I'm really into this car,

963
00:32:45,793 --> 00:32:47,870
but how do I know if
I'm getting a good deal?

964
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:50,370
I tell TrueCar my zip and which car I want

965
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:52,140
and TrueCar shows the
range of prices people

966
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,370
in my area actually paid for the same car,

967
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:56,170
so I know if I'm getting a great price.

968
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:58,650
This is how car buying
was always meant to be.

969
00:32:58,650 --> 00:32:59,963
This is TrueCar.

970
00:32:59,963 --> 00:33:00,796
(dramatic music)

971
00:33:00,796 --> 00:33:01,843
(lighter clicking)

972
00:33:01,843 --> 00:33:03,454
(egg tapping)
(food sizzling)

973
00:33:03,454 --> 00:33:04,814
(rooster crows)

974
00:33:04,814 --> 00:33:07,825
(metal scrapes)
(bacon sizzles)

975
00:33:07,825 --> 00:33:11,745

982
00:33:30,052 --> 00:33:30,885
(bird screeching)

983
00:33:30,885 --> 00:33:31,790
- [Announcer] Beat by the heat?

984
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:35,180
Are you tired of those
hot, sticky, sweaty days?

985
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,480
No matter what you do,
you can't get relief

986
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,400
from the sun's scorching rays!

987
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,050
Now, there's the Arctic hat,

988
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:42,440
the evaporative-cooling hat

989
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,100
that keeps you 20 degrees cooler

990
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,650
than the outside temperature!

991
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:48,820
And has a built-in UV barrier
that reflects the sun's heat

992
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,490
and harmful UV rays.

993
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:53,210
Just put it on for instant
relief from the sun,

994
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:56,380
or wet the inner liner and get
the ultimate cooling relief.

995
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,830
You'll feel 20 degrees cooler instantly

996
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:01,070
and it will keep you cool for hours!

997
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:03,310
The secret is hydro-chill technology,

998
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:06,490
an evaporative lining holds
and gradually releases water

999
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:07,840
for continuous cooling,

1000
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,110
while the built-in UV
barrier blocks over 99%

1001
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,640
of the sun's harmful rays,

1002
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,470
keeping you cool and
comfortable all day long.

1003
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:19,110
Look, this man's head is
a scorching 102 degrees,

1004
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:21,880
but with Arctic Hat,
he's a comfortable 78.

1005
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,880
That's over 20 degrees cooler!

1006
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,550
Breathable and light-weight
with ventilated panels

1007
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:28,260
that allow air to flow freely.

1008
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,970
It's perfect for the
beach or going for a hike,

1009
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:33,140
all kinds of outdoor activities!

1010
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:35,250
It's like having a
personal air conditioner

1011
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,590
everywhere you go!

1012
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:39,620
Whether you're out enjoying
nature or working in the yard,

1013
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,320
the Arctic Hat will be
your cooling companion.

1014
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,910
- I'm always outside working in the heat,

1015
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:45,330
but with the Arctic Hat,

1016
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:47,820
I'm feelin' cool and comfortable all day.

1017
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,890
- I burn very easily,

1018
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:51,870
but the Arctic Hat's UV
protection let's me stay outside

1019
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:53,320
a lot longer without worry.

1020
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:56,270

adjustable so one size fits all!

1036
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:34,340
- I like to plan my activities
before I take a trip

1037
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:38,360
so by the time I get there,
I can just enjoy the ride!

1038
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:41,040

1044
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:59,061
- [Owl] Read reviews, check
hotel prices, book things to do.

1045
00:35:59,061 --> 00:36:00,423
TripAdvisor.

1046
00:36:00,423 --> 00:36:02,600
(dramatic music)

1047
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,640
- All right, President Trump
just Tweeted this morning

1048
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,397
that, "Democrats must change
the loophole in asylum laws

1049
00:36:07,397 --> 00:36:08,637
"but they probably won't.

1050
00:36:08,637 --> 00:36:09,597
"They want open borders,

1051
00:36:09,597 --> 00:36:12,100
"which means massive crime and drugs!"

1052
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,413
This as the border patrol
is telling FOX News

1053
00:36:14,413 --> 00:36:17,400
that it is looking into these
recent allegations of agents,

1054
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,500
former agents, making
controversial comments and more

1055
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,300
about lawmakers and illegal
immigrants themselves

1056
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,650
in a second private Facebook group,

1057
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:29,040
and one that was taken down
later than the first one.

1058
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,210
Anyway, it's a bit confusing.

1059
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:31,043
Let's get the read

1060
00:36:31,043 --> 00:36:33,210
from the National Border
Patrol Council President,

1061
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:34,700
back with us, Brandon Judd.

1062
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,630
Brandon, good to have you.

1063
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:38,220
- Thank you, I appreciate
bein' on with you.

1064
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,440
- Do you know, Brandon,

1065
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,440
the latest wave of these Facebook postings

1066
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:46,880
that apparently involve more
agents, and former agents,

1067
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,320
than the original roundup
that was critical of illegals

1068
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,230
who are being held at
these detention centers,

1069
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:55,920
and even those visiting detention centers?

1070
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,550
- I do, there's a couple Facebook
pages that are out there.

1071
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:03,270
You've got the "I'm 10-15",
you've got the "I'm 10-15x2",

1072
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:05,200
you've got "The Real CBP Nation".

1073
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,170
All of these Facebook
pages have been critical

1074
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:09,680
of illegal aliens,

1075
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,780
they've been critical
of certain lawmakers.

1076
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,620
Now there's some things
that have been posted

1077
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,380
on those Facebook pages
that are perfectly fine,

1078
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:19,470
they're political talk and
you can actually do that.

1079
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:23,100
But there's other things that
are absolutely reprehensible

1080
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:26,320
and I'm aware that there's
been about 13 letters

1081
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,030
that have been sent out
to current employees

1082
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,350
that are cease and desist letters,

1083
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:33,120
telling them that they need
to stop their Facebook posts

1084
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,370
and that's just the initial.

1085
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:37,700
Now the investigation has to go into,

1086
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:41,980
were these posts of the
nature that violates policy?

1087
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:44,390
And if they were, those individuals
will be held accountable

1088
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:45,830
and they need to be held accountable.

1089
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,170
- When you say, "held accountable," fired?

1090
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:50,540
- It could be, it strictly depends

1091
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,540
on what the nature of the posts were.

1092
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,880
I mean, if they're bad enough,

1093
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,910
if they're releasing information
about law enforcement,

1094
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:59,900
sensitive information,
they're gonna be very,

1095
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:00,935
very strict sanctions--
- What if they were--

1096
00:38:00,935 --> 00:38:02,100
- And yes, they could be.
- Just disparaging,

1097
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,490
or sometimes deemed, racist, comments?

1098
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,323
Would you--
- Oh, there--

1099
00:38:05,323 --> 00:38:06,380
- Would you fire them for that?

1100
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:09,703
- Yes, if they're racist
comments, absolutely.

1101
00:38:10,642 --> 00:38:13,900
We cannot, as uniformed law enforcement,

1102
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,090
we cannot show that we have a bias.

1103
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:17,610
If we have a bias,

1104
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:20,230
then you cannot properly enforce the laws.

1105
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:22,980
There is no place in law enforcement

1106
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,000
for individuals that are racist.

1107
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,910
There's no place in law enforcement

1108
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:29,930
for people that hate
other groups of people

1109
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:33,580
because you obviously cannot
enforce the laws properly

1110
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:36,470
if you're already bringing
that bias into the workplace.

1111
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:37,303
- You know, Brandon,

1112
00:38:37,303 --> 00:38:39,620
the reason why I asked that
is Senator Chuck Schumer had

1113
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:42,210
called for the firing of
Mark Morgan on all this,

1114
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:43,150
the acting commissioner

1115
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:45,670
of the Customs and Border Protection--

1116
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,503
- That's wrong.

1117
00:38:46,503 --> 00:38:49,020
- Ultimately picked to lead the agency

1118
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:52,690
because of what was happening
under him, what do you think?

1119
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:54,260
- No, that's absolutely wrong.

1120
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:57,870
In fact, Commissioner
Morgan, I can tell ya

1121
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:00,333
that when he was the chief
of the Border Patrol,

1122
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:02,400
he was made aware of just one post

1123
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,310
and he immediately took action

1124
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:07,120
and he took the most severe action

1125
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,370
that he possibly could have taken

1126
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:10,530
under labor laws at that time.

1127
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:14,370
So Commissioner Morgan,
currently Commissioner Morgan,

1128
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:15,780
he did what he needed to do.

1129
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:19,470
What's funny is Senator Schumer
called for his termination

1130
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:20,880
before he was even the commissioner.

1131
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,530
I mean, he's over at ICE,
he was the director of ICE

1132
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:26,250
and Senator Schumer is
calling for his termination

1133
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:28,050
when he's not even the commissioner.

1134
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,300
Senator Schumer has it
completely and totally wrong.

1135
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,450
He needs to look deeper and
he needs to look at the people

1136
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:35,670
that have been here for an awful-long time

1137
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:36,880
that should have been aware of this

1138
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,700
and should have been taking proper action.

1139
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,360
- You know, I don't know
where the truth starts

1140
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:45,080
or the exaggerations begin
on these Facebook postings,

1141
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,280
but one of the things that Politico

1142
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,580
and others have reported, Brandon,

1143
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:51,560
is that higher ups were aware of this,

1144
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,400
they weren't proud of
it, but they were aware.

1145
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,410
Do you know anything about any of this?

1146
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:58,860
- They absolutely were aware of this.

1147
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:03,400
CBP is required to monitor
what agents are doing,

1148
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,720
whether it's on duty, off duty.

1149
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:09,830
These Facebook pages, they
were aware of these pages,

1150
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:10,710
I mean, you had a great--
- And did they tell them

1151
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:11,730
to take them down?

1152
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:14,710
Or did they take it down?
- No, no they didn't.

1153
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:17,870
In fact, if you look at
these Facebook pages,

1154
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:21,240
there were a great many
high-level managers

1155
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,250
that were on these pages.

1156
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:25,440
So yes, they were absolutely aware of it,

1157
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,120
they did have a responsibility
to do something about it

1158
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,410
and they didn't.

1159
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:31,750
Again, I'm gonna point back to 2017,

1160
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:33,723
almost two years to the date,

1161
00:40:35,514 --> 00:40:37,700
the National Border Patrol
Council sent out an advisory

1162
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:40,217
to agents telling them,
"You need to be careful

1163
00:40:40,217 --> 00:40:42,207
"about what you're posting on Facebook.

1164
00:40:42,207 --> 00:40:44,347
"There are certain
things that you can post,

1165
00:40:44,347 --> 00:40:45,180
"but there are certain things

1166
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,007
"that are absolutely inappropriate

1167
00:40:47,007 --> 00:40:50,010
"and could potentially
affect your job status."

1168
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:52,340
And CBP didn't follow up.

1169
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:54,750
I mean, if you look at the Facebook posts,

1170
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:55,920
the National Border Patrol Council,

1171
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,250
we were the first ones to come
out and condemn those posts

1172
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:02,963
when the ProPublica article broke.

1173
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:06,670
The agency came in later after us

1174
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:10,900
and this is what happens
on a very regular basis

1175
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,990
and frankly, it's very frustrating to us.

1176
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:17,010
We want the most honorable
organization that we can have.

1177
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:19,220
This agency is a very important agency,

1178
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,870
the work that we do is extremely important

1179
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:22,940
for the American public.

1180
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:25,390
We are charged with securing the border

1181
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:26,507
and we have to do it properly

1182
00:41:26,507 --> 00:41:28,720
and have to have the
right agents to do it.

1183
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,030
- Brandon, we'll watch closely,

1184
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:30,920
thank you for taking the time.

1185
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,660
Brandon Judd, the National
Border Patrol Council President,

1186
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,880
joining us out of Salt Lake City.

1187
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,720
Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

1188
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,770
- Meanwhile, I want to show you

1189
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:39,090
what's happening in California right now.

1190
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:40,280
This is Ridgecrest.

1191
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,540
Thankfully, no reports
of significant injuries,

1192
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,560
but as you can see, there
were structure fires

1193
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,790
as a result of gas leaks
throughout the city.

1194
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:49,030
The state's emergency services
director leaving the door

1195
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:52,000
open for the possibility that
still more serious damage

1196
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,100
as daylight emerges and they're
able to reassess all of this

1197
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:59,470
in the wake of a 7.1 magnitude
follow up earthquake,

1198
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:04,290
after a 6.4 magnitude
earthquake just the day before.

1199
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:07,510
That is technically 10 times more serious.

1200
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:08,393
More after this.

1201
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:15,060
- [Announcer] The ant

thrilling path to follow.

00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:14,870
- And I'm Andrew Cooper!

1227
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:17,820
- In 2015, we took a surf
trip to Bali, Indonesia

1228
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:18,653
and saw first-hand,

1229
00:43:18,653 --> 00:43:21,750
just how bad the world's plastic
pollution crisis really is.

1230
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:24,250
We wanted to make it our
mission to solve this problem

1231
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:25,180
and we have.

1232
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:26,250
- [Andrew] We started cleaning the ocean

1233
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:28,770
by ourselves until 2017,

1234
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:31,890
when we started our ocean
cleanup company, 4ocean.

1235
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:33,930
- Now, we've become the world's largest

1236
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:34,960
ocean cleanup company,

1237
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,530
employing captains and
crews seven days a week

1238
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:39,270
to clean our oceans and coastlines.

1239
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:41,530
We've operated out of
27 different countries

1240
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:44,150
and to date, we've removed
over two million pounds

1241
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:45,640
of trash from the ocean.

1242
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,180
And now, we're inviting you

to join the clean ocean movement.

1244
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:50,680
- [Andrew] All of our
cleanup efforts are funded

1245
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,790
entirely through the sale of our bracelet.

1246
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:55,350
The 4ocean bracelet is

- All right, we try to be
very fair and balanced here.

1282
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:19,420
We just heard from the border
patrol unity, Brandon Judd,

1283
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:21,820
now to a border state
Democrat who isn't impressed

1284
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:25,380
with what he's been hearing
out of border officials.

1285
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:28,450
Texas Democratic Congressman Al Green.

1286
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:30,650
Congressman, very good to have you.

1287
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:32,230
- Good to be with you, Mr. Cavuto.

1288
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,580
- Neil, please, you're the
congressman, the big cheese here,

1289
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:35,711
not me.
- (laughs) You're kind.

1290
00:45:35,711 --> 00:45:37,140
You're kind.
- So let me get your take

1291
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:39,250
on what Brandon Judd was just saying, sir,

1292
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:42,670
that if he finds that
people have made, in fact,

1293
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:44,223
these obnoxious comments,

1294
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,410
border agents have been
charged with making

1295
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:49,840
on these Facebook posts, since taken down,

1296
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,500
he would advocate firing them.

1297
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:52,900
Is that good enough for you?

1298
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,880
- Yes, it is good enough.

1299
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,230
I'm sure there are other things
that can be done, as well,

1300
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:03,550
but if a person exhibits racial views

1301
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:07,650
that are abhorrent, racism as
it was called by the agent,

1302
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:10,900
by the way, I commend him, I
think that it is appropriate

1303
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,950
to consider terminating the relationship.

1304
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:18,810
- This measure that was
overwhelmingly approved

1305
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:20,920
in Congress, the $4.6 billion funding

1306
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,100
to deal with the crisis at the border,

1307
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:24,200
did you vote for that?

1308
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,010
- I did.

1309
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:28,460
- And you did so to ease the congestion

1310
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:31,113
and the problems with the
kids and everyone else, right?

1311
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:35,180
- Well, I did so for a
multiplicity of reasons

1312
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:38,410
and I understand why
those who did not do so.

1313
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:40,500
I did so because, quite frankly,

1314
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,680
I've been talkin' for some time

1315
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,530
about the conditions at the border.

1316
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:45,610
I went there, I saw the conditions

1317
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:47,910
and I wanted to do what
I could, in my own way,

1318
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:49,240
to be helpful.

1319
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,360
But I understand that
those who chose not too,

1320
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:54,770
to, in a sense, highlight the fact

1321
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:56,840
that there needs to be more transparency,

1322
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,640
there needs to be more accountability.

1323
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,163
I respect what they did.

1324
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:05,430
For me, seeing that baby with her father

1325
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:10,110
on the shores of the river,
that touched my heart in a way

1326
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:13,130
such that it was impossible
for me to vote otherwise.

1327
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:15,490
- You know, as you've
pointed out, Congressman,

1328
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:16,760
these children popping up

1329
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:19,710
in these migrant centers
is quintuple what it was

1330
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:23,270
under Barack Obama, under whom
these facilities were built

1331
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:27,063
in the first place, but
not prepared for the crowds

1332
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:31,810
that fill these facilities today.

1333
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:34,840
So is this really the agent's fault,

1334
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:37,483
or for that matter even Homeland Security?

1335
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:41,310
- Mr. Cavuto, I thank you
for asking the question

1336
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:46,310
because it's a question that
really merits an answer.

1337
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:48,610
The question is this,

1338
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:53,350
are we there to facilitate
the law, or are we there

1339
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:55,570
to deter people from
coming into the country?

1340
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:58,350
In the early part of the 19th century,

1341
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:01,930
we were processing five
to 10,000 people per day.

1342
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:05,160
We never separated children
from their parents.

1343
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:09,220
Persons were fleeing
Scandinavia and Eastern Europe

1344
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:13,510
and they came by the millions
and we processed them.

1345
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:16,000
The question is, do we really
want to process people,

1346
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,330
if we do, we can,

1347
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:19,820
or do we want to find the means
by which we can deter them

1348
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:20,924
from coming?
- But you would have

1349
00:48:20,924 --> 00:48:21,954
to admit to the--
- I believe--

1350
00:48:21,954 --> 00:48:24,290
- You would have to admit that
these numbers are staggering,

1351
00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:27,050
even dwarfing what Barack
Obama was dealing with

1352
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:29,760
when he, too, would look
into briefly separating kids

1353
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,280
from families just to make
sure that those with whom

1354
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:36,193
they were traveling were in
fact, that they're related.

1355
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:39,060
- Well, compared to those

1356
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:41,350
who were comin' through Ellis Island,

1357
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:44,614
they are not dwarfing
numbers, especially given--

1358
00:48:44,614 --> 00:48:46,080
- But this isn't Ellis Island.
- They didn't have--

1359
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:46,975
- This is right at our border.
- The computer equipment

1360
00:48:46,975 --> 00:48:47,808
that we have currently.

1361
00:48:47,808 --> 00:48:49,300
- This is a very different case,

1362
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:52,780
right here, right there, right now.

1363
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:53,613
So do you think--
- Well, Ellis Island--

1364
00:48:53,613 --> 00:48:56,550
- That the $4.6 billion
that's been allocated

1365
00:48:56,550 --> 00:48:58,900
to deal with this, would you be happy

1366
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:01,340
if it's still the same
folks in charge of this,

1367
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:04,100
or do you want someone else running it?

1368
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:06,310
- Well, let me continue,
I have to say this

1369
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:07,470
and I'll answer your question.

1370
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:10,100
But those who were coming
through Ellis Island were right

1371
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:13,750
there, right then and we respected them

1372
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:15,090
and we welcomed them.

1373
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:17,060
There seems to be a removal

1374
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:18,790
of the welcome mat for those

1375
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:19,623
who are coming from--
- No, no, no, no--

1376
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:20,659
- South of the border.
- We welcomed them

1377
00:49:20,659 --> 00:49:21,700
because they had assurances

1378
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:24,580
that there were family or
friends who take them in,

1379
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:25,413
who could take care of them

1380
00:49:25,413 --> 00:49:27,120
and not the United States government,

1381
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,220
very different environment.

1382
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:32,180
- Well, a good many of
them did not, Mr. Cavuto,

1383
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:33,610
and by the way, a good many of the people

1384
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:35,040
who were coming from south of the border,

1385
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,300
they have family, friends

1386
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:38,590
and persons who can assist them, as well,

1387
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:40,240
but we are turning them away

1388
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,950
without even giving them an interview

1389
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:43,210
to a certain extent now,

1390
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:46,510
by pushing the interview
process to Mexico.

1391
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:48,020
And now, to your question about

1392
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:50,980
whether or not the persons who
are in charge are the persons

1393
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:52,840
who should remain in charge,

1394
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:56,130
it's my opinion that
persons who are in charge,

1395
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:58,310
some of them are victims themselves

1396
00:49:58,310 --> 00:50:02,470
because they are forced
to enforce policies

1397
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:04,690
that, quite frankly, are abhorrent.

1398
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:07,470
A policy of separating
children from their parents,

1399
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:09,530
no country should have such a policy

1400
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:10,674
and we should--
- Well, you can understand--

1401
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:12,300
- Not be proud of this.
- Why it happens, though.

1402
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,500
I mean, in the cases where--
- No, I cannot.

1403
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:15,333
- All right, so--
- I cannot.

1404
00:50:15,333 --> 00:50:17,270
- When Barack Obama was entertaining that

1405
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:19,560
because he simply didn't know where a lot

1406
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:20,393
of these kids were coming from,

1407
00:50:20,393 --> 00:50:22,450
now he didn't formally separate them

1408
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:24,180
for extended periods of time,

1409
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:27,180
but he recognized that some
of them were being used

1410
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:29,423
as leverage to get into this country.

1411
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,510
- Among any group of folk,

1412
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:36,270
you'll have some things
that are not appropriate,

1413
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:37,640
but the overwhelming majority

1414
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,480
of these people are coming here

1415
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:42,687
to escape persecution,

1416
00:50:42,687 --> 00:50:44,220
escape crime.

1417
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:46,730
I just returned from El Salvador.

1418
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:48,870
I went there to bring back a constituent

1419
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:51,560
who had been deported
and we brought him home.

1420
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:54,520
He had a 10-year bar
on him, a Mr. Escobar,

1421
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,410
he was married to an American woman,

1422
00:50:56,410 --> 00:50:58,330
he had two American-born children,

1423
00:50:58,330 --> 00:51:01,380
he reported to ICE and he was deported

1424
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:04,470
with the money in his pocket
and the clothes on his back.

1425
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:05,810
We brought him home.

1426
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:07,670
So I think it's the attitude

1427
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:10,270
that we have to deal with, Mr. Cavuto.

1428
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:11,300
I really do and listen,

1429
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:13,860
let me thank you for giving
me the opportunity to say that

1430
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:16,380
because quite frankly, we are finding

1431
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:18,357
that it's difficult to
get that message out

1432
00:51:18,357 --> 00:51:19,280
and I appreciate it.
- Well, no, I appreciate

1433
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,380
you're coming on, Congressman.

1434
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:23,070
That commercial, unfortunately,
won't stop for love or money

1435
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:24,360
but I want to thank you.

- When my doctor put me

1450
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:02,090
on a cholesterol-lowering statin drug,

1451
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:04,430
I knew I should take CoQ10 with it.

1452
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:06,520
I take Qunol CoQ10.
(water splashes)

1453
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:07,353
Why?

1454
00:52:07,353 --> 00:52:09,350
Because Qunol has three
times better absorption

1455
00:52:09,350 --> 00:52:10,473
than regular CoQ10.

1456
00:52:11,408 --> 00:52:13,480
Qunol, the better CoQ10.

1457
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,540
- No matter what I wore,

1458
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:17,460
I worried someone might see
my bladder-leak underwear,

1459
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:20,280
so I switched to Always Discreet Boutique.

1460
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,550
It's shape-hugging threads
smooth out the back,

1461
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:27,107
so it fits better than
Depend and no one notices.

updated images coming out

1522
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:47,410
of California right now and
that 7.1 magnitude earthquake,

1523
00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:50,980
which technically was 10 times more severe

1524
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:54,020
than the one that preceded
it just 24 hours earlier.

1525
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:56,910
Jeff Paul is in Ridgecrest,
California with the very latest.

1526
00:54:56,910 --> 00:54:57,743
Hey, Jeff.

1527
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:03,410
- Yeah, Neil, and this
earthquake was felt far and wide.

1528
00:55:03,410 --> 00:55:04,600
I mean, we're right here,

1529
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,360
the closest city near the epicenter

1530
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,390
of this magnitude 7.1 earthquake,

1531
00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:11,610
but there are reports of people
as far north as Sacramento,

1532
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:15,800
as far east as Phoenix, Arizona
and as far south as Mexico,

1533
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:18,400
feeling some sort of rumbling due

1534
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,810
to this particular earthquake

1535
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:22,770
that happened just after
eight o'clock local time.

1536
00:55:22,770 --> 00:55:24,530
Now as you take a look at
some of this video here,

1537
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:26,380
this is some video that my producer shot

1538
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:28,110
as we were out grabbin' a bite to eat,

1539
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:29,330
or at least trying to.

1540
00:55:29,330 --> 00:55:33,920
There was first a smaller
aftershock that was just minor,

1541
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,120
but then a few minutes later,

1542
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:39,040
that's when that 7.1 magnitude
earthquake rumbled through.

1543
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,960
Yeah, you can hear the things
crashing in the restaurant,

1544
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:44,670
you could hear people screaming
as they tried to take cover,

1545
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:46,240
or find some safety.

1546
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,680
And then shortly after that,

1547
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:51,000
if you sorta got your wits about you,

1548
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,520
we started hearing the sirens,

1549
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:54,200
police going in every direction,

1550
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:57,460
ambulances trying to respond
to the flurry of calls

1551
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:59,410
that they got after this huge earthquake.

1552
00:55:59,410 --> 00:56:01,560
And then we saw fire off into the distance

1553
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:04,800
and we know of at least one
structure that was destroyed,

1554
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,530
we've heard about a few other fires caused

1555
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:10,410
likely due to gas lines ruptures.

1556
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:14,070
And a big part of that,
because of those fires

1557
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:17,060
and because of the
uneasiness from residents,

1558
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:19,790
some are choosing to sleep outside

1559
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:22,190
and they slept outside last night.

1560
00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:24,440
We just caught up with one resident,

1561
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:26,350
we asked her how she's gonna be,

1562
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:29,283
sort of, living her life
moving forward, take a listen.

1563
00:56:30,610 --> 00:56:32,700
- If it happens, it happens.

1564
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:35,647
But I'm not gonna sit
around and wait for it

1565
00:56:35,647 --> 00:56:39,370
and not do anything, I can't do that.

1566
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:42,420
I've sat on the bench in our
picnic area for two nights now,

1567
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:43,593
I'm not gonna do that.

1568
00:56:44,718 --> 00:56:46,860
I'm just gonna get on with
life and if it hits, it hits.

1569
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:48,280
There's nothin' I can do to stop it,

1570
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,070
there's nothin' I can do to forewarn me,

1571
00:56:50,070 --> 00:56:52,763
so I just gotta keep busy
so I don't think about it.

1572
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:57,670
- And, Neil, experts warn
there will be more aftershocks

1573
00:56:57,670 --> 00:56:58,870
and there is a chance

1574
00:56:58,870 --> 00:57:01,600
there could be an even
bigger earthquake on the way.

1575
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:02,433
Neil.

1576
00:57:02,433 --> 00:57:04,500
- Jeff Paul, thank you, my
friend, be safe yourself.

1577
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:05,620
Jeff Paul in the middle of all of that.

1578
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:07,530
By the way, we're keeping an eye on Iran,

1579
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:10,540
it's already threatened to
retaliate over one of its tankers

1580
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:12,160
seized by the British.

1581
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:16,580
It's warning that it's prepared
to seize a British tanker.

1582
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:17,413
Then what?

1583
00:57:17,413 --> 00:57:18,246
After this.

1584
00:57:21,779 --> 00:57:25,231
(dramatic marching music)
(app beeps)

1585
00:57:25,231 --> 00:57:26,064
(engine roars)

1586
00:57:26,064 --> 00:57:27,840
- [Announcer] From two stories to 20,

1587
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:32,543
from ready apps to emergency response,

1588
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:36,863
from your community to
a nationwide network,

00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:40,873
the cleanup specialists at 1-800-SERVPRO,

1590
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:46,930
everything under your
roof, everyone under ours.

1591
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:47,970
Helping to make fire

1592
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:50,953
and water damage like
it never even happened.

1593
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,060
- Hi, I'm Dana Loesch from "The Dana Show"

1594
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:56,240
and I wanna tell you about
a really simple thing

1595
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,460
you can do that helps promote more energy

1596
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:01,000
and supports healthy
blood pressure levels.

1597
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,630
This is SuperBeets and I swear by it.

1598
00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:05,140
It gives me more healthy energy

1599
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:06,950
to keep up with my hectic schedule

1600
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:09,400
and you're gonna love
what it does for you, too.

1601
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:11,080
- I can definitely use
a little more energy,

1602
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:13,680
especially if it's from a
natural source, like beets.

1603
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:16,570
- If I had something natural and healthy

1604
00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:18,750
that gave me energy, I'd be all in.

1605
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:20,640
- Beets contain an essential nutrient

1606
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,490
that makes them one

1607
00:58:21,490 --> 00:58:24,580
of the most heart-healthy
vegetables in nature.

1608
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:26,620
SuperBeets concentrates that nutrient

1609
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:28,610
into superfood crystals.

1610
00:58:28,610 --> 00:58:30,240
SuperBeets contains real food

1611
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,430
that helps increase circulation

1612
00:58:32,430 --> 00:58:36,100
to get more oxygen flowing
throughout your body naturally.

1613
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:37,940
It's supports healthy blood pressure

1614
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:39,640
and gives you more healthy energy

1615
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:41,420
to make the most of your day.

1620
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:54,660
- I just mix a teaspoon
into a few ounces of water.

1621
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:57,930
There's the natural apple
flavor, or black cherry flavor.

1622
00:58:57,930 --> 00:58:59,350
It tastes great!

1623
00:58:59,350 --> 00:59:00,280
- It's really yummy.

1624
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:01,860
- It's a good flavor, I'm surprised.

1625
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:03,400
- It doesn't taste like beets at all.

1626
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,060
- I'll finish this, by the way.

1627
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:06,930
- [Dana] What if you had more energy?

1628
00:59:06,930 --> 00:59:08,900
Imagine the possibilities.

1629
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:10,610
- You feel strong and you feel healthy

1630
00:59:10,610 --> 00:59:12,890
and you feel like you
can accomplish anything.

1631
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:14,940
- If I'm doing the
things that I need to do

1632
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:16,810
to give me the energy, I feel better,

1633
00:59:16,810 --> 00:59:18,550
not only physically, but mentally.

1634
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:20,320
- So do something good for your heart,

1635
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:23,560
your circulation, your blood
pressure and your energy!

1646
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:55,050
- [Announcer] This is the
couple who wanted to get away,

1647
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:58,010
who used Expedia to book
the vacation rental,

1648
00:59:58,010 --> 01:00:00,090
which led to the discovery

1649
01:00:00,090 --> 01:00:04,590
that sometimes a little
downtime can lift you right up.

1650
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:06,830
Expedia, everything you need to go.

1651
01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:08,890
- Let's be honest, you only
talk about your insurance

1652
01:00:08,890 --> 01:00:11,173
when you complain about it.

1653
01:00:11,173 --> 01:00:12,006
(woman murmurs)
Good point.

1654
01:00:12,006 --> 01:00:13,960
That's why Esurance is
making the whole experience

1655
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:16,570
surprisingly painless, so you
never have to talk about it

1656
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:18,511
unless you're their spokesperson.

1657
01:00:18,511 --> 01:00:19,440
(toothbrushes clattering)

1658
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,885
Esurance, it's surprisingly painless.

1659
01:00:21,885 --> 01:00:24,260
(dramatic music)

1660
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:26,190
- All right, fast-moving
developments on Iran right now.

1661
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:29,170
It is demanding the United
Kingdom release the oil tanker

1662
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:32,940
it seized from Iran, it's right
now, I believe in Gibraltar.

1663
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:35,440
This, as Iran says, it will
not negotiate with the U.S.

1664
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,210
until sanctions are lifted.

1665
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:40,290
With us is a former USS
Cole Commander Kirk Lippold

1666
01:00:40,290 --> 01:00:41,950
and, Commander, when it rains, it pours.

1667
01:00:41,950 --> 01:00:44,360
We understand that the
President just got off the phone

1668
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:46,250
with Theresa May of Britain,

1669
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:48,670
the soon-to-be outgoing
prime minister of Britain,

1670
01:00:48,670 --> 01:00:50,157
saying that, "The two countries are

1671
01:00:50,157 --> 01:00:54,617
"closely coordinating responses
to whatever Iran is planning

1672
01:00:54,617 --> 01:00:56,767
"and pushing for the
full denuclearization,

1673
01:00:56,767 --> 01:00:58,380
"separately, of North Korea,"

1674
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:01,730
but obviously, in contact as
to judge what happens next.

1675
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:04,060
You know this region very, very well

1676
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:07,100
and you know what the
Iranians might be considering,

1677
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:10,770
they're not adverse to seizing
personnel in the region,

1678
01:01:10,770 --> 01:01:12,850
as they did back in 2007,

1679
01:01:12,850 --> 01:01:14,930
when they stormed a British frigate

1680
01:01:14,930 --> 01:01:18,010
and, I believe, held about a
dozen men and women captive

1681
01:01:18,010 --> 01:01:19,460
for a while before releasing them.

1682
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:22,440
So they're up to that and
they're apparently itching

1683
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,520
to do that, or the same kinda thing.

1684
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,300
What do you think?

1685
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:28,103
- Well, I think, Neil, it's
a significant development

1686
01:01:28,103 --> 01:01:32,260
in the fact that the British
decided to seize this tanker.

1687
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:35,290
Clearly, it was in violation,
not just of U.S. sanctions,

1688
01:01:35,290 --> 01:01:37,780
but more importantly, EU sanctions,

1689
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:40,230
with that oil headed towards Syria.

1690
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:43,020
That oil tanker carries
two million barrels of oil,

1691
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:46,190
which equates to about 84 million gallons,

1692
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:48,050
that was huge for the Syrian regime

1693
01:01:48,050 --> 01:01:49,370
to be able to support itself,

1694
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:51,560
and the fact that that's
been cut off is good.

1695
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:52,800
What Iran does next?

1696
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:55,200
I think they should choose very wisely

1697
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:58,810
because they do not want to
accidentally start something

1698
01:01:58,810 --> 01:02:01,670
that they may not be
able to stop or control.

1699
01:02:01,670 --> 01:02:03,560
- All right, we understand,
I might have misspoke,

1700
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:06,010
Commander, that this conversation
between the President

1701
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:07,990
and Theresa May was actually yesterday,

1702
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:11,390
the details about it are
only coming to light today.

1703
01:02:11,390 --> 01:02:13,640
But they did talk about shared interests

1704
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,810
in enforcing sanctions on Syria

1705
01:02:15,810 --> 01:02:18,770
to ensure Iran doesn't
obtain a nuclear weapon.

1706
01:02:18,770 --> 01:02:23,200
But with the Iranians ready to
exceed the uranium production

1707
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:26,260
that would make such a thing more likely.

1708
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:27,710
They're not payin' attention.

1709
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:29,940
- Well, when you look at it,

1710
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:32,320
Iran is getting squeezed much quicker

1711
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,340
and much harsher than they anticipated

1712
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:37,620
when President Trump put these
sanctions back into place.

1713
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:40,610
If they in fact break
the cap that they claim

1714
01:02:40,610 --> 01:02:42,810
that they have with respect to the amount

1715
01:02:42,810 --> 01:02:45,420
they're allowed to have
for enriched uranium,

1716
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:47,230
they're in violation of the agreement.

1717
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:50,000
That now moves things into
a whole different category

1718
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,000
and as a letter written
yesterday by Senators Cruz

1719
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,190
and Rubio, and I believe one other,

1720
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:56,210
they're looking and saying,

1721
01:02:56,210 --> 01:02:57,810
now that they violate that agreement,

1722
01:02:57,810 --> 01:02:59,530
we're now into the UN category

1723
01:02:59,530 --> 01:03:02,700
where the snapback sanctions
can in fact come into place.

1724
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:04,870
This is now engaging the whole world

1725
01:03:04,870 --> 01:03:07,860
because Iran is not just
against the U.S. at this point,

1726
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:09,420
now they're against the world.

1727
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:10,870
And when Iran is doing that,

1728
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:14,070
they're gonna find themselves
increasingly isolated,

1729
01:03:14,070 --> 01:03:15,700
not just from the U.S.,

1730
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:18,750
but also our European allies
are going to begin to realize

1731
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:21,280
that they need to not
only support the U.S.,

1732
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:24,220
but more importantly support
the UN in what we're doing

1733
01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:26,760
to ensure that Iran never develops

1734
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:28,590
that nuclear weapons capability.

1735
01:03:28,590 --> 01:03:30,900
- In the meantime, everyone's
waiting to see what they do

1736
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:34,610
in response to this UK vessel move.

1737
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:37,780
I was mentioning in 2007, seizing a vessel

1738
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:40,600
that the Iranians claim was
not in international waters

1739
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:41,433
but their waters,

1740
01:03:41,433 --> 01:03:42,470
but when it comes to the Strait of Hormuz,

1741
01:03:42,470 --> 01:03:45,260
or almost anything wet
nearby Iran, (laughs)

1742
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:48,840
they declare that as their
land or their waters.

1743
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:51,450
So how do you,

1744
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:53,420
even argue for what are

1745
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:55,720
internationally-recognized standards,

1746
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:59,163
12 miles from a country's
shore is everybody's water.

1747
01:04:00,330 --> 01:04:02,160
- Well, it's a international waterway,

1748
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:04,640
it's recognized under international law.

1749
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,860
While the Iranians may make that claim,

1750
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:09,410
it has absolutely no weight when it comes

1751
01:04:09,410 --> 01:04:11,300
to that international standard.

1752
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:12,690
So people are going to be able

1753
01:04:12,690 --> 01:04:14,800
to continue to transit that waterway

1754
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:17,140
and if Iran does interfere with it,

1755
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:19,330
then the international
community at that point,

1756
01:04:19,330 --> 01:04:23,020
has an obligation to do whatever it takes,

1757
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:26,110
diplomatically, economically
and if necessarily,

1758
01:04:26,110 --> 01:04:29,270
militarily to ensure that
the waterway stays open

1759
01:04:29,270 --> 01:04:32,040
for the pre-transit of
oil out of the Middle East

1760
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:34,240
to keep the world's economies going.

1761
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:35,760
- Commander, thank you very, very much,

1762
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,810
good chatting with you again.

1763
01:04:37,810 --> 01:04:39,070
- As always, Neil, thank you.

1764
01:04:39,070 --> 01:04:40,220
- All right, in the meantime,

1765
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:42,730
we have not forgotten about
the 2020 presidential race,

1766
01:04:42,730 --> 01:04:46,340
a lot of Democrats are already
knee-deep in fundraising

1767
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:48,290
and a lot of them knee-deep in cash.

1768
01:04:48,290 --> 01:04:49,330
Who has the most?

1769
01:04:49,330 --> 01:04:50,640
It's a little early in the process,

1770
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:53,060
but never too early to start
picking through the numbers

1771
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:53,893
and what they might mean.

1772
01:04:53,893 --> 01:04:56,160
To do that, Gillian Turner in
Washington with the latest.

1773
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,790
Hey, Gillian.
- Hey, good morning, Neil.

1774
01:04:57,790 --> 01:04:59,810
So the competition for funds, as you said,

1775
01:04:59,810 --> 01:05:01,330
is stiff this election cycle

1776
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:03,820
and it got even tighter
among the top-tier Democrats

1777
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:06,030
during the second quarter of this year,

1778
01:05:06,030 --> 01:05:07,680
according to the new numbers.

1779
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:09,970
Candidates are on deadline to report Q2

1780
01:05:09,970 --> 01:05:14,170
to the FEC by July 15th, but
most made it in under the gun.

1781
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:15,200
Let's take a look.

1782
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,840
So far, Pete Buttigieg comes in tops

1783
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:21,030
at $24.8 million in haul.

1784
01:05:21,030 --> 01:05:25,040
Joe Biden up next with $21.5 million.

1785
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:27,360
Then Bernie Sanders with $18 million,

1786
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:30,020
followed by Kamala
Harris with $12 million.

1787
01:05:30,020 --> 01:05:32,890
After Harris, though, the
drop-off's pretty steep.

1788
01:05:32,890 --> 01:05:37,100
Michael Bennet comes in next
with a $2.8 million haul

1789
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:38,800
and says, "He's feelin' the heat."

1790
01:05:40,330 --> 01:05:42,993
- I haven't been running for
president for a long time,

1791
01:05:42,993 --> 01:05:44,880
I just got in the race.

1792
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,790
So what I'm concerned about is making sure

1793
01:05:46,790 --> 01:05:49,380
that we continue to raise
the resources we need

1794
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:52,830
to be able to be competitive
in the early states

1795
01:05:52,830 --> 01:05:54,130
of Iowa and New Hampshire.

1796
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:56,700
- So these numbers matter, Neil,

1797
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:59,190
because the candidates
will all need every dollar

1798
01:05:59,190 --> 01:06:01,940
they can get in order
to make it to round two,

1799
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:04,520
the next Democratic
debate's comin' up soon.

1800
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:06,690
The other thing, the number
that matters a lot here,

1801
01:06:06,690 --> 01:06:09,410
popularity, Biden's
still 10 points out ahead

1802
01:06:09,410 --> 01:06:10,650
of his Democratic colleagues,

1803
01:06:10,650 --> 01:06:12,810
even after falling a
little bit in the polls

1804
01:06:12,810 --> 01:06:14,800
after the last debate last week.

1805
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:15,633
Neil.

1806
01:06:15,633 --> 01:06:16,910
- Gillian, thank you very, very much.

1807
01:06:16,910 --> 01:06:18,040
We are keeping track--
- You bet.

1808
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,570
- Of where the candidates
are going to be today.

1809
01:06:19,570 --> 01:06:21,580
For example, Joe Biden,
we understand, is going

1810
01:06:21,580 --> 01:06:24,940
to be spending a good chunk
of time in South Carolina,

1811
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:28,110
consider a must-win for
him to stabilize a campaign

1812
01:06:28,110 --> 01:06:29,780
that's been buffeted lately.

1813
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:32,620
Republican South Carolina
Senator Tim Scott,

1814
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:33,453
joining us right now.

1815
01:06:33,453 --> 01:06:35,310
Senator, good to have you.

1816
01:06:35,310 --> 01:06:37,400
- Good morning, Neil,
good to be back with you.

1817
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:39,860
- Joe Biden's going to be in
your beautiful state today.

1818
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:43,840
He has talked to the press
since of course that debate

1819
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:46,160
where he's been sort
of universally panned,

1820
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:49,060
that he can right the ship,

1821
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:51,670
he's looking forward,
not looking backward,

1822
01:06:51,670 --> 01:06:54,533
how does he look in your
state on the Democratic side?

1823
01:06:55,610 --> 01:06:56,980
- You know, from my friends on the left,

1824
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:59,840
they tell me that he's
still their preferred choice

1825
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:02,110
because their goal is
to find the candidate

1826
01:07:02,110 --> 01:07:04,880
that they think will be the
most competitive against

1827
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:06,300
our President Trump.

1828
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:09,917
The fact is that I think
their goal of keeping Biden

1829
01:07:09,917 --> 01:07:12,280
as a front runner is an
important one for them,

1830
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:14,380
but Kamala Harris is creeping up.

1831
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:16,520
African-American voters are the majority

1832
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:17,970
in the Democrat primary

1833
01:07:17,970 --> 01:07:21,220
and therefore her performance
against Joe Biden,

1834
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:24,520
especially on a racial issue like busing,

1835
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:28,570
has prompted more folks to
start taking a second look

1836
01:07:28,570 --> 01:07:32,160
at her and she is now
gaining within the state.

1837
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:34,390
She has been behind in the
African-American community,

1838
01:07:34,390 --> 01:07:37,280
which has been quite
unusual and interesting.

1839
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:39,740
Joe Biden's legacy as
the first vice president

1840
01:07:39,740 --> 01:07:43,720
of the first African-American
president has served him well.

1841
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:46,680
But those numbers are startin'
to show a lot of cracks.

1842
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:47,907
- You know, as you've
reminded in the past, Senator,

1843
01:07:47,907 --> 01:07:50,930
I just thought you were talking
book about South Carolina

1844
01:07:50,930 --> 01:07:52,720
in your pride of being the senator there,

1845
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:54,050
but it has really turned a lot

1846
01:07:54,050 --> 01:07:55,350
of races in the past, hasn't it?

1847
01:07:55,350 --> 01:08:00,350
It was there that George Bush
put John McCain's surge to bed

1848
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:02,880
and he went on, ultimately,

1849
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:06,430
to win the Republican nomination in 2000,

1850
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:09,820
putting him aside in South Carolina.

1851
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:13,020
We saw something very, very
similar with Barack Obama,

1852
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:16,110
an African-American who
had to win in that state

1853
01:08:16,110 --> 01:08:18,390
and did, handily over Hilary Clinton

1854
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:21,870
on his route for the
nomination at the time.

1855
01:08:21,870 --> 01:08:25,413
I'm wondering if it will play
a similar role this go round?

1856
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:28,600
- I think so, I call it
the miracle of the mo.

1857
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:31,300
Momentum is a huge factor in politics

1858
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:34,610
and the first in the South
primary state, South Carolina,

1859
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:38,160
has proven to be the springboard
to presidential success

1860
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:39,810
on the right as well as the left.

1861
01:08:40,856 --> 01:08:42,330
I think since 1980,

1862
01:08:42,330 --> 01:08:44,940
South Carolinians have
chosen the right president

1863
01:08:44,940 --> 01:08:49,140
on the Republican side all
times except for one time.

1864
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:52,010
On the Democrat side, they've
had a lot of success, as well.

1865
01:08:52,010 --> 01:08:55,810
I think South Carolina is
poised to make the decision

1866
01:08:55,810 --> 01:08:57,860
for the Democrats this cycle.

1867
01:08:57,860 --> 01:08:59,920
It'll be interesting
to see who they choose.

1868
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:03,730
I still think we're a long
way, of course, away from 2020,

1869
01:09:03,730 --> 01:09:05,620
but it'll be very interesting to see

1870
01:09:05,620 --> 01:09:08,880
who will stand toe-to-toe
with President Trump.

1871
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:11,090
I like our odds right now, by the way.

1872
01:09:11,090 --> 01:09:13,980
I think we're in a very good
position, the economy's strong,

1873
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:17,610
our international relationships
are getting stronger,

1874
01:09:17,610 --> 01:09:20,500
our president was very
presidential on Fourth of July.

1875
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:23,290
There's no doubt that when
you look at the 2020 election,

1876
01:09:23,290 --> 01:09:26,200
it's gonna be a strong, powerful matchup,

1877
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:28,910
but right now, I'm pretty
excited about where we are.

1878
01:09:28,910 --> 01:09:31,027
- You know, Senator, it's
very early and you remind me

1879
01:09:31,027 --> 01:09:33,880
it's very early so don't
get fixated on polls,

1880
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:36,590
but are you surprised, given
the strength of the economy,

1881
01:09:36,590 --> 01:09:40,900
given the unexpected 224,000
job surge in the latest month

1882
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:43,890
and all the good things that
go with that including markets

1883
01:09:43,890 --> 01:09:45,470
in and out of all-time highs,

1884
01:09:45,470 --> 01:09:47,940
that the President isn't
benefiting more from that?

1885
01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:50,300
What do you think is happening?

1886
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:52,123
- Well, we're in a very polarized place

1887
01:09:52,123 --> 01:09:54,400
from a political
perspective, called America.

1888
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,870
It has been challenging
for a very long time,

1889
01:09:56,870 --> 01:09:58,890
it's been getting worse, incrementally.

1890
01:09:58,890 --> 01:10:01,440
There's no doubt that we've
had a lot of distractions

1891
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:04,357
from what should be,
as the old saying goes,

1892
01:10:04,357 --> 01:10:06,130
"The economy, stupid."

1893
01:10:06,130 --> 01:10:09,050
If we focus our attention
on the economic progress

1894
01:10:09,050 --> 01:10:11,590
that we've made, especially
in the most fragile,

1895
01:10:11,590 --> 01:10:14,350
economic Americans, we
would be celebrating.

1896
01:10:14,350 --> 01:10:16,900
Six million jobs created
since the tax reform,

1897
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:19,520
half of those jobs have been occupied

1898
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,490
by African-Americans and Hispanics.

1899
01:10:21,490 --> 01:10:23,000
We have a lot to celebrate,

1900
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:27,770
but there have been so many
distractions durin' this cycle

1901
01:10:27,770 --> 01:10:30,180
that if we start focusing on the reality

1902
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:32,390
of what matters to the average American,

1903
01:10:32,390 --> 01:10:34,450
how much more money am I taking home,

1904
01:10:34,450 --> 01:10:39,160
what is my likelihood for
success in this economy,

1905
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:42,490
can my kids expect a
better America than I?

1906
01:10:42,490 --> 01:10:45,580
The answer is consistently yes.

1907
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:47,220
The numbers bear that out,

1908
01:10:47,220 --> 01:10:51,690
but the narrative that we
hear consistently has nothing

1909
01:10:51,690 --> 01:10:52,807
to do with the reality,

1910
01:10:52,807 --> 01:10:55,590
it has to do with the
rhetoric of Washington.

1911
01:10:55,590 --> 01:10:59,050
That is, unfortunately,
distracting a lot of Americans

1912
01:10:59,050 --> 01:11:02,200
from what is, in fact, the
greatest economy we've seen

1913
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:03,760
in more than three decades.

1914
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:06,450
We've seen more progress
in race relations,

1915
01:11:06,450 --> 01:11:09,060
even right now I make this statement,

1916
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:11,640
more progress in race relations,

1917
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:14,420
more firsts than we've ever seen.

1918
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:16,380
We should be excited to be Americans

1919
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:21,320
and we should be excited to be
Americans right now in 2019.

1920
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:24,320
There's so many distractions
trying to divide us

1921
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:26,780
because if we stand united, we win,

1922
01:11:26,780 --> 01:11:29,430
if are divided, we are in jeopardy.

1923
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:30,990
I think we're gonna get our act together

1924
01:11:30,990 --> 01:11:34,670
and I think the left has
been selling a rhetoric

1925
01:11:34,670 --> 01:11:36,580
as if it were reality.

1926
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:38,420
We're gonna be able to
discern the difference

1927
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:41,230
and create the contrast so
that the average American,

1928
01:11:41,230 --> 01:11:43,770
whether they vote for Republicans or not,

1929
01:11:43,770 --> 01:11:44,880
that's not the question,

1930
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:48,170
is America better off under
the conservative principles

1931
01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:50,000
and policies put in place?

1932
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,291
The answer is resoundingly, yes.

1933
01:11:53,291 --> 01:11:55,700
- But do you think the President
risked torpedoing that,

1934
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:58,770
Senator, by this ongoing
trade riff with China?

1935
01:11:58,770 --> 01:12:01,420
Now tariffs have really
not had a chance to kick in

1936
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:04,900
since so many goods were
already on store shelves.

1937
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:07,920
I believe they were going
to kick in when stuff,

1938
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:10,160
mid-shipment, would get
to the United States.

1939
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:12,350
So the real impact of
that hasn't been felt

1940
01:12:12,350 --> 01:12:15,250
and the President argues
that he likes tariffs anyway,

1941
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:16,640
that a lot of money is coming in.

1942
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:19,180
But average Americans pay those tariffs

1943
01:12:19,180 --> 01:12:22,480
and I'm wondering if you feel
he's out of step with that,

1944
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:25,710
or out of sync with that,
and it's gonna cost him?

1945
01:12:25,710 --> 01:12:28,410
- Well, I like to break the
tariff conversation down

1946
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:29,700
into multiple categories.

1947
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:30,800
When you think about China,

1948
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:33,870
China's goal is to steal the future,

1949
01:12:33,870 --> 01:12:36,280
which would imperil American progress.

1950
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:38,550
President Trump's approach with China is a

1951
01:12:38,550 --> 01:12:43,250
necessary altercation so that
we can restore confidence

1952
01:12:43,250 --> 01:12:46,770
in our workforce and create
the best future going forward

1953
01:12:46,770 --> 01:12:48,370
from a technological standpoint.

1954
01:12:49,933 --> 01:12:52,440
The goal for their IP theft is simply

1955
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:54,230
to steal the future of work.

1956
01:12:54,230 --> 01:12:55,510
We're not gonna let that happen.

1957
01:12:55,510 --> 01:12:56,680
- So tariffs are worth it--
- I applaud--

1958
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:58,090
- In that regard to you?
- The President's approach.

1959
01:12:58,090 --> 01:12:59,770
- You agree with the
President's tariffs are worth it

1960
01:12:59,770 --> 01:13:01,047
to send that message,

1961
01:13:01,047 --> 01:13:03,780
but do you think tariffs
are a good thing, period,

1962
01:13:03,780 --> 01:13:04,970
that if--
- No, no--

1963
01:13:04,970 --> 01:13:06,480
- If this isn't settled,

1964
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:09,720
it's gonna boomerang on Republicans?

1965
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:11,580
- No question, there's
no doubt that today,

1966
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:12,810
if you look at the six or seven states

1967
01:13:12,810 --> 01:13:15,190
that you were talking
about earlier in the show,

1968
01:13:15,190 --> 01:13:16,880
the wage gains in those states

1969
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,839
that tariffs get put in jeopardy,

1970
01:13:19,839 --> 01:13:22,910
their wage growths have
outstripped the wage growths

1971
01:13:22,910 --> 01:13:24,870
that we're celebrating at 3.1%.

1972
01:13:24,870 --> 01:13:27,800
Some states have had four,
five, 6% wage growth,

1973
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:29,890
that's exciting news,
especially in those sectors,

1974
01:13:29,890 --> 01:13:31,140
but the truth is

1975
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:33,970
that the overall tariff
conversation is not

1976
01:13:33,970 --> 01:13:36,600
in the best interest of
Americans, without any question.

1977
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:39,100
I put the asterisk out there for China,

1978
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:41,610
because it's a very different
conversation we're having.

1979
01:13:41,610 --> 01:13:43,980
We're using tariffs in trade as a means

1980
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:47,360
of resetting tectonic shift in the plates

1981
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:48,193
on our relationships.

1982
01:13:48,193 --> 01:13:49,640
But when you think about the USMCA,

1983
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:50,940
when you think about Europe,

1984
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:53,180
we have to make sure
that we don't go too far.

1985
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:56,530
The 232 auto tariffs is a classic example,

1986
01:13:56,530 --> 01:13:57,700
where I have pushed back,

1987
01:13:57,700 --> 01:14:00,930
because I think they create
headwinds throughout the South.

1988
01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:03,120
- Senator, it's always a
pleasure catching up with you,

1989
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:05,480
be well.
- Thank you, sir.

1990
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:07,410
- All right, Senator Tim
Scott of South Carolina,

1991
01:14:07,410 --> 01:14:09,660
joining us out of Mount
Pleasant, South Carolina.

1992
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:10,493
We mentioned the President,

1993
01:14:10,493 --> 01:14:13,170
he says he's looking into
using an executive order

1994
01:14:13,170 --> 01:14:17,460
to get that citizenship question
back on the 2020 Census.

1995
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:20,570
Now forget about your
politics, is that even legal?

1996
01:14:20,570 --> 01:14:21,403
After this.

1997
01:14:24,351 --> 01:14:28,780
- Any time Philly plays New
York, it's a like a lit fuse.

1998
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:31,933
Only a matter of time
before we get the fireworks.

1999
01:14:33,030 --> 01:14:35,640
Led by one of the game's biggest stars,

2000
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:38,772
Bryce is ready to make
his mark on this rivalry.

2001
01:14:38,772 --> 01:14:41,263
- [Commentator] Absolutely crushed!

2002
01:14:41,263 --> 01:14:43,402
- [Announcer] The other by a rookie phenom

2003
01:14:43,402 --> 01:14:44,260
with power you have to see to believe.

2004
01:14:46,002 --> 01:14:47,754
- [Commentator] Alonzo, gets into one!

2005
01:14:47,754 --> 01:14:49,002
Gone!
(dramatic music)

2006
01:14:49,002 --> 01:14:52,503
- [Announcer] Phillies, Mets,
tonight at 7:00 Eastern on FOX

2007
01:14:52,503 --> 01:14:53,963
and the FOX Sports App.

2008
01:14:53,963 --> 01:14:55,960
- Meeting people is my life.

2009
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:58,570
I had to be careful how
wide I would open my mouth

2010
01:14:58,570 --> 01:15:00,470
because I was embarrassed
to show my teeth.

2011
01:15:00,470 --> 01:15:02,590
It was time to do something for myself

2012
01:15:02,590 --> 01:15:04,210
that was gonna be permanent.

01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:11,380
who suffer from missing or failing teeth.

2017
01:15:11,380 --> 01:15:14,270
- I felt like I was the
most important person

2018
01:15:14,270 --> 01:15:15,450
on Earth to them.

2019
01:15:15,450 --> 01:15:18,440
- Bill came in, bad
teeth, discomfort, pain.

2020
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:22,280
We needed to get him into a
smile that he felt confident in.

2021
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:25,250
We have expertise that he
might not find anywhere else,

all in one location.

2023
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:28,850
- [Bill] The next day, I had a new smile.

2024
01:15:28,850 --> 01:15:30,350
Couldn't wait to show some folks,

2025

can do for a person.

- [Bill] I'm eatin' corn on the cob.

2033
01:15:50,230 --> 01:15:52,430
I had the best smile
I'd ever had in my life.

2034
01:15:52,430 --> 01:15:54,870
- [Announcer] Call ClearChoice today.

2035
01:15:54,870 --> 01:15:57,260
- [Announcer] While
serving overseas in 2007,

2036
01:15:57,260 --> 01:16:00,040
Staff Sergeant Mark Lalli's
helicopter went down

2037
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:01,763
in a life-altering crash.

2038
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:06,163
- Of the 11 onboard,
only five of us survived.

2039
01:16:06,163 --> 01:16:09,680
I had to relearn how to speak,
how to eat and how to walk.

2040
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:12,860
How to do things that we all
take for granted every day.

2041
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:15,490
- [Announcer] Thankfully,
Wounded Warrior Project was there

2042
01:16:15,490 --> 01:16:16,450
for support.

2043
01:16:16,450 --> 01:16:19,210
- One of the first events
with Wounded Warrior Project

2044
01:16:19,210 --> 01:16:21,770
that I was involved with,
I met my future wife.

2045
01:16:21,770 --> 01:16:23,420
The first time she was over at the house,

2046
01:16:23,420 --> 01:16:26,570
she saw my walker and she
said, "Hey, do you use that?"

2047
01:16:26,570 --> 01:16:28,227
I said, "If we ever get to the point

2048
01:16:28,227 --> 01:16:29,607
"where we're gonna get married,

2049
01:16:29,607 --> 01:16:31,630
"I'll be on my feet, I promise you that."

2050
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:33,660
- When he told me he was
gonna walk down the aisle,

2051
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:36,820
it made me feel special and flattered.

2052
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:38,478
I just knew I was gonna marry him.

2053
01:16:38,478 --> 01:16:41,230
- I had to work as hard as I
could for as long as I had to

2054
01:16:41,230 --> 01:16:43,030
in order to make that happen.

2055
01:16:43,030 --> 01:16:45,564
I'm so thankful for
Wounded Warrior Project

2056
01:16:45,564 --> 01:16:48,596
for getting me where I
could meet my future wife

2057
01:16:48,596 --> 01:16:50,390
and walk down the aisle for her.

2058
01:16:50,390 --> 01:16:51,790
Gave me a life worth living.

2059
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:56,490
- Being detected was not an option.

2060
01:16:56,490 --> 01:16:59,413
If I was recognized, the
whole operation was blown.

2061
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:02,630
The element of surprise was imperative.

2062
01:17:02,630 --> 01:17:05,020
- Wow, (laughs) he won't
even recognize you!

2063
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:08,240
- Seriously, I don't even
recognize myself! (laughs)

2064
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:10,690
And thanks to my cashRewards
credit card from Navy Federal

2065
01:17:10,690 --> 01:17:12,770
with never expiring rewards,

2066
01:17:12,770 --> 01:17:15,128
it's gonna be a killer honeymoon!

2067
01:17:15,128 --> 01:17:16,920
- [Soldier] Woo, Maui!

2068
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:18,448
(woman laughs)

2069
01:17:18,448 --> 01:17:20,570
- Boom!
(upbeat music)

2070
01:17:20,570 --> 01:17:22,240
- [Announcer] Navy Federal Credit Union,

2071
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:24,290
our members are the mission.

2072
01:17:24,290 --> 01:17:26,648
(dramatic music)

2073
01:17:26,648 --> 01:17:28,048
- [Reporter] Are you going
to issue an executive order

2074
01:17:28,048 --> 01:17:29,190
on the census?

2075
01:17:29,190 --> 01:17:31,130
- We're thinking about doing
that, it's one of the ways.

2076
01:17:31,130 --> 01:17:33,060
We have four or five ways we can do it.

2077
01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:34,750
We can also add an addition on

2078
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:38,460
so we can start the printing
now and maybe do an addendum

2079
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:40,620
after we get a positive decision.

2080
01:17:40,620 --> 01:17:42,120
So we're working on a lot of things,

2081
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:43,823
including an executive order.

2082
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:46,840
- All right, the President
says he's looking into ways

2083
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:50,070
of adding that citizenship
question after all to the census,

2084
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:52,230
including, as he said
there, an executive order.

2085
01:17:52,230 --> 01:17:53,560
Would that hold up in court?

2086
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:55,230
It's not quite that black and white,

2087
01:17:55,230 --> 01:17:56,530
but who better to pick it apart

2088
01:17:56,530 --> 01:17:59,629
than attorney extraordinaire,
Mercedes Colwin.

2089
01:17:59,629 --> 01:18:00,919
- Hi, Neil.

2090
01:18:00,919 --> 01:18:02,430
- So as I understand, Mercedes,

2091
01:18:02,430 --> 01:18:05,370
the Supreme Court didn't
reject the argument

2092
01:18:05,370 --> 01:18:07,210
as much as say the administration,

2093
01:18:07,210 --> 01:18:08,740
through the Commerce Department,

2094
01:18:08,740 --> 01:18:11,320
didn't give it a compelling
enough case, right?

2095
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:13,060
- And didn't really give the explanation.

2096
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:15,317
So I'm going to step back to 2013

2097
01:18:15,317 --> 01:18:16,750
because they had a similar case

2098
01:18:16,750 --> 01:18:17,970
regarding the Voting Rights Act.

2099
01:18:17,970 --> 01:18:19,890
It had nothing to do with the census

2100
01:18:19,890 --> 01:18:23,670
or the citizenship issue, but
it had to do with that law.

2101
01:18:23,670 --> 01:18:26,090
Chief Justice Roberts, who
was the Chief Judge then,

2102
01:18:26,090 --> 01:18:27,950
said we're gonna step away.

2103
01:18:27,950 --> 01:18:29,360
The federal government's gonna step away

2104
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:31,900
and let the states deal
with the electoral process,

2105
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:34,410
they can do the legislation
at the local level.

2106
01:18:34,410 --> 01:18:35,290
So basically,

2107
01:18:35,290 --> 01:18:38,940
the governance on the
Federal's part, step back.

2108
01:18:38,940 --> 01:18:42,320
Now 2019, now the federal
government steps in

2109
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:46,090
and says, hey, we want
to help with respect

2110
01:18:46,090 --> 01:18:48,810
to the Voting Rights Act,
which what it did was,

2111
01:18:48,810 --> 01:18:51,290
made sure that the individuals could vote,

2112
01:18:51,290 --> 01:18:53,370
regardless of discrimination.

2113
01:18:53,370 --> 01:18:56,390
If you go back decades ago,
that's where it germinated.

2114
01:18:56,390 --> 01:18:59,430
It started with allowing
individuals to vote,

2115
01:18:59,430 --> 01:19:00,900
regardless of their race.

2116
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:04,310
Well now, so the Chief Judge Roberts says,

2117
01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:07,620
why are you going back
to the Voting Rights Act,

2118
01:19:07,620 --> 01:19:11,600
which we already ruled in 2013,
let the states deal with it,

2119
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:14,260
why is the Federal government
stepping in now in 2019

2120
01:19:14,260 --> 01:19:18,350
and say, well, we're going
to assist in the promulgation

2121
01:19:18,350 --> 01:19:19,260
of the Voting Rights Act,

2122
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:20,990
make sure that it's enforced properly,

2123
01:19:20,990 --> 01:19:22,930
make sure that there's no discrimination,

2124
01:19:22,930 --> 01:19:25,440
make sure that the districts
that have a high number

2125
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:27,560
of individuals that are of color

2126
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:29,850
or have the appropriate numbers

2127
01:19:29,850 --> 01:19:32,440
of representation in Congress,

2128
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:34,670
when we've already ruled that
the states can deal with this?

2129
01:19:34,670 --> 01:19:35,920
- So what kind--
- So that's--

2130
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:36,753
- Of compelling argument--
- The difference on this.

2131
01:19:36,753 --> 01:19:39,810
- Do they need to make to win
over this particular judge,

2132
01:19:39,810 --> 01:19:41,350
who has to be won over?

2133
01:19:41,350 --> 01:19:43,500
- Sure, frankly, just
step forward and say,

2134
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:45,810
look, we wanna look at the districting.

2135
01:19:45,810 --> 01:19:47,297
Just come straight out and say,

2136
01:19:47,297 --> 01:19:48,547
"It's not so much discrimination

2137
01:19:48,547 --> 01:19:50,617
"because we know, Chief
Judge, that your ruled

2138
01:19:50,617 --> 01:19:54,347
"on letting the local government
deal with this in 2013,

2139
01:19:54,347 --> 01:19:55,587
"we're looking to make sure

2140
01:19:55,587 --> 01:19:58,040
"that there's appropriate
levels of representation."

2141
01:19:58,040 --> 01:20:00,380
So if their districts,
and this is what a lot

2142
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:03,660
of the DOJ members have been
writing about in these op-eds,

2143
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:05,377
have said, "Why don't
you just come forward

2144
01:20:05,377 --> 01:20:08,037
"and say hey, we might need this.

2145
01:20:08,037 --> 01:20:10,007
"We might need greater
numbers of representation,

2146
01:20:10,007 --> 01:20:11,947
"but in order for there
to be greater numbers

2147
01:20:11,947 --> 01:20:14,417
"of representation in Congress or less,

2148
01:20:14,417 --> 01:20:16,857
"we need to know how
many U.S. citizens are

2149
01:20:16,857 --> 01:20:18,960
"in particular jurisdictions
around the country."

2150
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:21,710
- So why wasn't there a tenth the fuss

2151
01:20:21,710 --> 01:20:23,060
when the question was taken out?

2152
01:20:23,060 --> 01:20:25,400
'Cause it used to be
a staple in the census

2153
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:28,323
then it was taken out under
the Obama administration.

2154
01:20:29,230 --> 01:20:30,850
I don't remember anyone saying boo then,

2155
01:20:30,850 --> 01:20:32,700
so why is it a big deal
putting it back in?

2156
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:35,120
- Well, I think what Chief Judge wanted,

2157
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:36,430
someone to come forward and say,

2158
01:20:36,430 --> 01:20:38,630
hey, it was about districting and yes,

2159
01:20:38,630 --> 01:20:40,120
we're gonna talk not only

2160
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:42,170
about the districting issue and how much,

2161
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:43,330
it's also the infrastructure.

2162
01:20:43,330 --> 01:20:46,366
You've got $980 billion that--
- So they're thinking--

2163
01:20:46,366 --> 01:20:47,199
- You're going to give--
- There might be something--

2164
01:20:47,199 --> 01:20:48,467
- Around the country.
- Sinister afoot here

2165
01:20:48,467 --> 01:20:50,720
and they wanna prove or disprove that.

2166
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:52,080
- Exactly, especially in the history

2167
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,250
of the Voting Rights Act back in 2013.

2168
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:55,168
I think--
- That's interesting.

2169
01:20:55,168 --> 01:20:56,110
- If you've got the same Chief Judge,

2170
01:20:56,110 --> 01:20:57,700
so he's looking and saying--
- I didn't know that.

2171
01:20:57,700 --> 01:20:58,533
- Just come forward.

2172
01:20:58,533 --> 01:20:59,890
Can I say a quick hi to my mom?

2173
01:20:59,890 --> 01:21:01,970
She's watching, hi, Roslyn!

2174
01:21:01,970 --> 01:21:03,080
Love ya, Mom!
- That's nice.

2175
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:05,007
Was it, Roslyn, she's a very smart woman.

2176
01:21:05,007 --> 01:21:05,900
- Roslyn Stern, she's amazing!

2177
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:06,940
- She is, indeed.
(Mercedes laughs)

2178
01:21:06,940 --> 01:21:09,270
All right, Mercedes,
thank you very, very much.

2179
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:12,430
Tom Homan, the former acting ICE Director,

2180
01:21:12,430 --> 01:21:15,050
his read on all of this
and what this means

2181
01:21:15,050 --> 01:21:17,810
if the President can't
get that question in.

2182
01:21:17,810 --> 01:21:18,643
After this.

2183
01:21:21,807 --> 01:21:22,886
(phone rings)

2184
01:21:22,886 --> 01:21:25,180
- Uh-oh, looks like
someone's still nervous

2185
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:26,430
about buyin' a new house.

2186
01:21:27,266 --> 01:21:30,015
- Is it that obvious?
- Yes, it is.

2187
01:21:30,015 --> 01:21:31,760
You know, maybe you'd
worry less if you got Geico

2188
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:33,820
to help with your homeowner's insurance.

2189
01:21:33,820 --> 01:21:36,320
- I didn't know Geico helps
with homeowner's insurance.

2190
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,533
- Yeah, they've been doin' it for years.

tomorrow at 8:00 on History.

2267
01:24:31,581 --> 01:24:33,850
(dramatic music)

2268
01:24:33,850 --> 01:24:35,310
- All right, we've Tom Homan here,

2269
01:24:35,310 --> 01:24:38,440
the former acting ICE
director, he's gonna talk about

2270
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:40,730
this push the administration
has to go through

2271
01:24:40,730 --> 01:24:43,020
with these deportations,
more on that in a sec.

2272
01:24:43,020 --> 01:24:45,040
But I did wanna give
Tom a chance to respond

2273
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:47,940
to what Mercedes Colwin
was talking about regarding

2274
01:24:47,940 --> 01:24:49,580
of this question in the census

2275
01:24:49,580 --> 01:24:52,760
that the administration wants
to push by executive order

2276
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:55,940
to make sure you can still
ask are you a legal citizen

2277
01:24:55,940 --> 01:24:57,160
of the United States.

2278
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:59,060
Where do you think this is going, Tom?

2279
01:25:01,090 --> 01:25:03,740
- Well, I hope the
administration succeeds in it

2280
01:25:03,740 --> 01:25:04,830
for a couple of reasons.

2281
01:25:04,830 --> 01:25:06,940
Number one, don't we wanna know

2282
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:08,774
how many illegal aliens
are in the United States?

2283
01:25:08,774 --> 01:25:10,840
I mean, if they're talking
about immigration reform,

2284
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:13,900
free medical care, pathways to citizenship

2285
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:15,670
for people here illegally for a while,

2286
01:25:15,670 --> 01:25:17,740
don't we wanna know
what that population is?

2287
01:25:17,740 --> 01:25:19,250
I think that'd be the basis

2288
01:25:19,250 --> 01:25:20,770
of makin' some of these decisions.

2289
01:25:20,770 --> 01:25:22,930
And second of all, I
don't think representation

2290
01:25:22,930 --> 01:25:24,240
in the House of Representatives,

2291
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:27,910
or the Electoral College
that elects our president,

2292
01:25:27,910 --> 01:25:29,930
should be based on people
who are here illegally.

2293
01:25:29,930 --> 01:25:32,820
So I think it's good
for a couple of reasons.

2294
01:25:32,820 --> 01:25:35,370
- So, let me switch
gears a little bit here.

2295
01:25:35,370 --> 01:25:39,020
Regardless of how that works,
the administration still says

2296
01:25:39,020 --> 01:25:42,910
it's going to pursue these
deportations, legal deportations,

2297
01:25:42,910 --> 01:25:44,760
the kind that went under Barack Obama

2298
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:47,607
in cases already adjudicated and judged,

2299
01:25:47,607 --> 01:25:49,587
"All right, you have to go back to Mexico,

2300
01:25:49,587 --> 01:25:52,250
"or Honduras, or Guatemala," wherever,

2301
01:25:52,250 --> 01:25:53,383
and it's going to start soon,

2302
01:25:53,383 --> 01:25:55,713
the President didn't indicate how soon.

2303
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:58,560
How do you think that's going to go?

2304
01:26:00,570 --> 01:26:01,910
- Look, it's going to be controversial,

2305
01:26:01,910 --> 01:26:03,410
but I think it needs to be done.

2306
01:26:03,410 --> 01:26:05,580
It's not a question should it
be done, it has to be done.

2307
01:26:05,580 --> 01:26:08,220
And as you said, Neil, I did this

2308
01:26:08,220 --> 01:26:10,970
when I was the executive
associate director at ICE.

2309
01:26:10,970 --> 01:26:13,840
I ran a national operation
called Operation Border Guarding

2310
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:16,257
back in 2015, when we
went and sought out those

2311
01:26:16,257 --> 01:26:18,750
who had final orders,
specifically family units,

2312
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:20,240
and we arrested some family units,

2313
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:22,360
had final orders by an immigration judge,

2314
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:24,280
we put 'em on airplanes and sent 'em home

2315
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:25,700
and the borders numbers went down

2316
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:28,640
because we showed there's a
consequence to deterrence.

2317
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:32,540
If a final order by an immigration
judge, after due process,

2318
01:26:32,540 --> 01:26:33,940
doesn't mean anything,

2319
01:26:33,940 --> 01:26:35,230
then there's no integrity in the system,

2320
01:26:35,230 --> 01:26:37,120
just open the border
up and let everybody in

2321
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:38,450
because there's no consequence anymore,

2322
01:26:38,450 --> 01:26:40,450
there's no law, there's no
rule governing who can come in,

2323
01:26:40,450 --> 01:26:42,890
who can come into the
United States legally.

2324
01:26:42,890 --> 01:26:45,820
- Tom, what do you do
for the illegals here

2325
01:26:45,820 --> 01:26:49,450
and protected in sanctuary
cities, towns, or states?

2326
01:26:49,450 --> 01:26:50,890
They're gonna do
everything in their power,

2327
01:26:50,890 --> 01:26:53,060
these cities, towns, or states

2328
01:26:53,060 --> 01:26:57,693
to makes sure that the
Feds can't get in there.

2329
01:26:59,780 --> 01:27:01,290
- Well, they're not gonna stops the Feds

2330
01:27:01,290 --> 01:27:02,123
from doin' their job.

2331
01:27:02,123 --> 01:27:04,920
Look, they can not assist,
which they've done,

2332
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:06,817
or they do what the Oakland mayor did

2333
01:27:06,817 --> 01:27:08,690
and give 'em a heads up, "ICE is in town,"

2334
01:27:08,690 --> 01:27:09,780
but the men and women--
- But that's illegal--

2335
01:27:09,780 --> 01:27:10,613
- Who are in ICE are gonna do their job.

2336
01:27:10,613 --> 01:27:12,509
- The head's up is an illegal act, right?

2337
01:27:13,430 --> 01:27:14,263
- Not only that,

2338
01:27:14,263 --> 01:27:15,870
but you know you had a
congressman the other day,

2339
01:27:15,870 --> 01:27:17,930
Ocasio-Cortez talkin' about
how people should take 'em

2340
01:27:17,930 --> 01:27:18,763
into their homes.

2341
01:27:18,763 --> 01:27:20,130
Look, aiding and abetting,

2342
01:27:20,130 --> 01:27:22,140
harboring an illegal alien's a felony,

2343
01:27:22,140 --> 01:27:24,760
so you know, ICE is goin'
to take this seriously.

2344
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:26,310
These people've had their due process

2345
01:27:26,310 --> 01:27:27,820
at great tax payer expense.

2346
01:27:27,820 --> 01:27:29,200
They've been ordered by a judge to go home

2347
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:30,720
and if you and I can
ignore a judge's order,

2348
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:31,890
what would happen to us, Neil?

2349
01:27:31,890 --> 01:27:33,100
This has to be done.

2350
01:27:33,100 --> 01:27:36,074
As controversial as it
is, if we don't do it,

2351
01:27:36,074 --> 01:27:37,880
then we might as well just
blow the whole system up

2352
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:40,120
and open the border up,
because we have no security,

2353
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:41,280
we have no sovereignty,

2354
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:43,890
we have no rule over
all the country anymore.

2355
01:27:43,890 --> 01:27:45,920
If people wanna step in the way of ICE,

2356
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:47,730
then look for further action from ICE.

2357
01:27:47,730 --> 01:27:51,002
It's a crime to impede federal
law enforcement officers.

2358
01:27:51,002 --> 01:27:53,850
- The law's on your
side in this case, Tom,

2359
01:27:53,850 --> 01:27:54,880
there's no doubt about that,

2360
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:59,053
but of course, images can play
havoc in the middle of this.

2361
01:27:59,912 --> 01:28:00,745
The reason why I'm thinkin',

2362
01:28:00,745 --> 01:28:02,900
I'm old enough to remember
the Elian Gonzalez case

2363
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:04,680
when he was seized from a home

2364
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:07,570
and ultimately sent back to Cuba.

2365
01:28:07,570 --> 01:28:11,430
And was those images, legal
as they were to retrieve him,

2366
01:28:11,430 --> 01:28:13,530
that stuck in American's heads

2367
01:28:13,530 --> 01:28:15,200
during the Clinton administration.

2368
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:19,603
That's going to be inevitable,
the images of ICE agents,

2369
01:28:21,093 --> 01:28:23,340
rammin' on doors to try to get people,

2370
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:26,130
say, "All right, you're
arrested, you have to go back,"

2371
01:28:26,130 --> 01:28:27,630
how is that all gonna go down?

2372
01:28:29,050 --> 01:28:31,040
- Well, look, to those people

2373
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:32,890
who are gonna push that message,

2374
01:28:32,890 --> 01:28:34,147
I think you need to ask 'em a question,

2375
01:28:34,147 --> 01:28:35,207
"What is your option?

2376
01:28:35,207 --> 01:28:37,050
"What do you wanna do?"

2377
01:28:37,050 --> 01:28:39,350
Because if there's no
integrity in the system,

2378
01:28:39,350 --> 01:28:41,270
if people can come here
to the Unites States,

2379
01:28:41,270 --> 01:28:43,340
they can enter illegally
and get to stay forever

2380
01:28:43,340 --> 01:28:46,300
'cause we're not brave
enough to enforce the law,

2381
01:28:46,300 --> 01:28:48,490
that's gonna send a bad message
to the rest of the world,

2382
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:50,100
come here, violate our laws,

2383
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:51,850
the facilities will still be overcrowded.

2384
01:28:51,850 --> 01:28:54,280
If the message we wanna send
to the rest of the world is,

2385
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:56,820
come here with a child, you
can even have due process

2386
01:28:56,820 --> 01:28:58,940
at great tax payer expense,
billions of dollars,

2387
01:28:58,940 --> 01:29:01,140
and when the Federal
judge orders you removed,

2388
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:03,470
you don't have to leave
because it's uncomfortable

2389
01:29:03,470 --> 01:29:04,920
to arrest you and make you leave,

2390
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:06,570
then we're never gonna
solve the border crisis.

2391
01:29:06,570 --> 01:29:09,110
And this isn't just about
enforcin' the law, Neil,

2392
01:29:09,110 --> 01:29:10,610
this is about saving lives.

2393
01:29:10,610 --> 01:29:12,630
Children are dying entering this country,

2394
01:29:12,630 --> 01:29:14,620
31% of women are being raped.

2395
01:29:14,620 --> 01:29:16,800
We gotta send the message, it's not okay,

2396
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,490
and we're bankrollin'
criminal organizations

2397
01:29:18,490 --> 01:29:19,593
that are smuggling these people.

2398
01:29:19,593 --> 01:29:22,510
It's just not about enforcin'
laws, it's about saving lives

2399
01:29:22,510 --> 01:29:24,670
and takin' money out of
criminal organizations' hands.

2400
01:29:24,670 --> 01:29:27,180
It's the right thing to
do, as sad, as unfortunate,

2401
01:29:27,180 --> 01:29:31,030
sometimes enforcin' law is,
it doesn't mean we ignore it.

2402
01:29:31,030 --> 01:29:34,930
- I'd be remiss if I didn't
mention these Facebook postings

2403
01:29:34,930 --> 01:29:39,310
of a present, maybe former, CBP workers

2404
01:29:39,310 --> 01:29:41,730
who had disparaging comments they made

2405
01:29:41,730 --> 01:29:44,240
about those who they were
protecting at these facilities,

2406
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:45,790
towards those who visited them.

2407
01:29:47,260 --> 01:29:49,330
Do you believe, it's proven,

2408
01:29:49,330 --> 01:29:50,750
that many of them said the things

2409
01:29:50,750 --> 01:29:51,730
they were alleged to have said,

2410
01:29:51,730 --> 01:29:53,723
that they should be terminated?

2411
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:58,860
- I wanna wait and see what
the investigation shows,

2412
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:01,650
but I've been told that, from my sources,

2413
01:30:01,650 --> 01:30:03,340
there's only several people

2414
01:30:03,340 --> 01:30:06,130
that posted things to that extreme.

2415
01:30:06,130 --> 01:30:07,953
And of course, they need to be dealt with,

2416
01:30:09,914 --> 01:30:12,670
that's not the border patrol I
know and I think it distracts

2417
01:30:12,670 --> 01:30:15,240
from the fine work the
border patrols are doin'.

2418
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:16,980
But I'll say this,

2419
01:30:16,980 --> 01:30:19,450
at what point, when you
go to work every day,

2420
01:30:19,450 --> 01:30:21,280
you're being called a Nazi, a racist,

2421
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:22,680
that you're makin' women
drink outta toilets,

2422
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:24,480
which is total crap,

2423
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:27,730
and when you go to work
and you hear these things,

2424
01:30:27,730 --> 01:30:28,563
you get beaten down every day,

2425
01:30:28,563 --> 01:30:30,310
you get pushed in the corner every day,

2426
01:30:30,310 --> 01:30:33,030
at what point does your spirit get broken,

2427
01:30:33,030 --> 01:30:33,863
you may do some things

2428
01:30:33,863 --> 01:30:35,390
that you probably shouldn't have done?

2429
01:30:35,390 --> 01:30:37,530
I'm not makin' excuses for anybody,

2430
01:30:37,530 --> 01:30:39,590
but these men and women
of the border patrol,

2431
01:30:39,590 --> 01:30:42,650
they're doin' a great job in
a very difficult circumstances

2432
01:30:42,650 --> 01:30:45,670
and the vast, vast majority of
'em are doin' the right thing

2433
01:30:45,670 --> 01:30:48,270
for their nation, and if a
few people step outta line,

2434
01:30:48,270 --> 01:30:50,070
they should be dealt with absolutely.

2435
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:52,700
- All right, Tom Holman,
thank you very, very much.

2436
01:30:52,700 --> 01:30:53,800
Good seeing you again.

2437
01:30:55,310 --> 01:30:56,143
- [Tom] Good seeing you, Neil.

2438
01:30:56,143 --> 01:30:56,976
All right, to show ya that

2439
01:30:56,976 --> 01:30:58,790
this is indeed a world-wide problem,

2440
01:30:58,790 --> 01:31:01,310
again those who tried
to flee to safer shores,

2441
01:31:01,310 --> 01:31:05,270
an Italian rescue ship with 46
migrants on board has docked

2442
01:31:05,270 --> 01:31:08,930
in the Italian port city of Lampedusa,

2443
01:31:08,930 --> 01:31:13,340
against an explicit ban on refugees.

2444
01:31:13,340 --> 01:31:17,140
This isn't just in this country,
folks, this is world wide.

2445
01:31:17,140 --> 01:31:17,973
More after this.

2446
01:31:20,900 --> 01:31:22,190
- When I book at hilton.com,

2447
01:31:22,190 --> 01:31:24,270
I get to select my room
from the floor plan,

2448
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:26,850
free Wi-Fi and the price match guarantee.

2449
01:31:26,850 --> 01:31:28,448
- So with Hilton there is no catch.

2450
01:31:28,448 --> 01:31:30,345
- (laughs) Yeah, the only
catch is I'm never leaving.

2451
01:31:30,345 --> 01:31:31,178
(woman laughs)

2452
01:31:31,178 --> 01:31:32,920
No, I'm serious, I live here now.

2453
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:35,980
Book at hilton.com and get the
Hilton Price Match Guarantee.

2454
01:31:35,980 --> 01:31:38,570
- What if there was something
that can reduce body fat,

2455
01:31:38,570 --> 01:31:42,160
boost mood, get rid of
wrinkles, tighten saggy skin

2456
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:45,190
and make you look and
feel decades, not years,

2457
01:31:45,190 --> 01:31:46,410
but decades younger?

2458
01:31:46,410 --> 01:31:50,290
I'm talking about human
growth hormone, or HGH.

2459
01:31:50,290 --> 01:31:52,280
Finally, there's SeroVital.

2460
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:53,350
- [Announcer] In a clinical trial,

2461
01:31:53,350 --> 01:31:56,750
SeroVital has been shown to
boost your HGH naturally,

2462
01:31:56,750 --> 01:31:59,939
up to an astonishing 682%.

2463
01:31:59,939 --> 01:32:01,630
- SeroVital gave me my youth back.

2464
01:32:01,630 --> 01:32:03,560
- [Announcer] SeroVital, available at ULTA

2465
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:05,910
and smarter retailers nationwide.

2466
01:32:05,910 --> 01:32:07,350
- Look, cleaning the outside

2467
01:32:07,350 --> 01:32:09,364
of your windows is a real chore.

2468
01:32:09,364 --> 01:32:10,197
(woman screams)

2469
01:32:10,197 --> 01:32:12,190
And who wants to climb a dangerous ladder

2470
01:32:12,190 --> 01:32:14,065
just to get to the second floor?

2471
01:32:14,065 --> 01:32:15,210
(woman sighs)
Not anymore!

2472
01:32:15,210 --> 01:32:18,270
Hi, Jon Florell, the Fuller Brush man

2473
01:32:18,270 --> 01:32:21,600
and this is Full Crystal,
from the Fuller Brush Company.

2474
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:25,810
The fastest, easiest way to
clean all of your windows

2475
01:32:25,810 --> 01:32:28,190
in minutes, not days.

2476
01:32:28,190 --> 01:32:29,840
Just add the cleaning crystals,

2477
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:33,390
attach it to any garden
hose and away ya go!

2478
01:32:33,390 --> 01:32:36,290
The secret is in the
Fuller cleaning crystals

2479
01:32:36,290 --> 01:32:40,600
that dissolve dust, dirt,
pollen and grime in no time!

2480
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:42,090
And here's the best part,

2481
01:32:42,090 --> 01:32:43,860
you don't have to remove your screens

2482
01:32:43,860 --> 01:32:46,680
because Full Crystal cleans them, too!

2483
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:48,510
Watch what I'm gonna do.

2484
01:32:48,510 --> 01:32:50,570
This screen may look clean,

2485
01:32:50,570 --> 01:32:54,070
but look how Full Crystal
blasts away the dust,

2486
01:32:54,070 --> 01:32:56,000
pollen, dirt and grime

2487
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:59,000
while it cleans your
window at the same time.

2488
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,560
And that'll save you a ton of time!

2489
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:04,550
Look, even with the ladder,
you couldn't reach that window.

2490
01:33:04,550 --> 01:33:06,440
But with the Full Crystal power sprayer,

2491
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:09,260
you can clean windows up to 27 feet high.

2492
01:33:09,260 --> 01:33:11,760
Simply aim, spray and walk away,

2493
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:14,030
leaving your windows
spot free, streak free

2494
01:33:14,030 --> 01:33:16,640
and with both feet securely on the ground.

2495
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:21,440
For a clean so clear, your
windows will virtually disappear!

2496
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:24,080
Plus, it's completely safe
for all of your plants,

2497
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:25,720
lawns, shrubs and flowers.

2514
01:34:08,100 --> 01:34:09,640
You and I are busy people

2515
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:12,750
and some days there's just
not enough time, am I right?

2516
01:34:12,750 --> 01:34:15,800

01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:30,683

That's Takl.

2525
01:34:36,121 --> 01:34:38,900
- With all that USAA offers,
why go with anybody else?

2526
01:34:38,900 --> 01:34:40,260
We know their rates are good,

2527
01:34:40,260 --> 01:34:42,070
we know that they're always
gonna take care of us.

2528
01:34:42,070 --> 01:34:43,170
- It was an instant savings

2529
01:34:43,170 --> 01:34:44,810
and I shoulda changed a long time ago.

2530
01:34:44,810 --> 01:34:47,420
- We're the Tenneys and
we're USAA members for life.

2531
01:34:47,420 --> 01:34:51,062
- [Announcer] Call USAA to
start saving on insurance today.

2532
01:34:51,062 --> 01:34:54,250
(hard rock music)

2533
01:34:54,250 --> 01:34:55,481
- [Chris] They're gonna come after you.

2534
01:34:55,481 --> 01:34:56,314
- [Joe] Sure they're gonna come after me.

2535
01:34:56,314 --> 01:34:58,070
- We're you prepared for
them you to come after you?

2536
01:34:58,070 --> 01:34:59,330
- I was prepared for them to come after me

2537
01:34:59,330 --> 01:35:02,620
but I wasn't prepared for the
person coming at me the way

2538
01:35:02,620 --> 01:35:03,453
she came at.

2539
01:35:04,670 --> 01:35:07,160
- All right, Joe Biden trying to explain

2540
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:08,920
his awful performance in that debate

2541
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:12,680
and Kamala Harris going
too far too quickly,

2542
01:35:12,680 --> 01:35:14,670
especially raising a busing issue

2543
01:35:14,670 --> 01:35:16,190
that goes back to the 1970s.

2544
01:35:16,190 --> 01:35:18,680
Now his supporters are
questioning, if he wasn't prepared

2545
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:20,350
for that, is he prepared for the job

2546
01:35:20,350 --> 01:35:23,040
of President of the United States at all?

2547
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:25,360
All In Together CEO Lauren
Leader back with us,

2548
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:27,040
Republican strategist Joseph Pinon

2549
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:30,380
and the host of "Sincerely
Kat" on FOX Nation, Kat Timf.

2550
01:35:30,380 --> 01:35:32,280
So, Lauren, let me ask you,

2551
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:35,033
it just seems like a lot
of excuse making here.

2552
01:35:36,809 --> 01:35:37,642
- (sighs) You know, you ask two questions,

2553
01:35:37,642 --> 01:35:38,850
"Is he prepared to be president?"

2554
01:35:38,850 --> 01:35:41,010
and I think he certainly
is incredibly qualified,

2555
01:35:41,010 --> 01:35:42,690
but that's not how you
get to be president.

2556
01:35:42,690 --> 01:35:44,980
I mean the fact is that
there are 25 candidates

2557
01:35:44,980 --> 01:35:46,440
that are gonna come after him.

2558
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:47,660
Sitting at the top of the polls is

2559
01:35:47,660 --> 01:35:49,730
actually not a great
place to be this early on

2560
01:35:49,730 --> 01:35:51,730
because it opens up a million doors

2561
01:35:51,730 --> 01:35:53,340
to scrutinize every piece of his record.

2562
01:35:53,340 --> 01:35:55,270
And look, younger voters are paying

2563
01:35:55,270 --> 01:35:56,450
very close attention to this,

2564
01:35:56,450 --> 01:35:58,390
younger voters and women, particularly,

2565
01:35:58,390 --> 01:35:59,300
are really watching to ask--

2566
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:00,290
- [Neil] Has he lost
them since this debate?

2567
01:36:00,290 --> 01:36:01,460
- No, I don't think he's lost them,

2568
01:36:01,460 --> 01:36:04,630
but I think he's gonna have
a serious enthusiasm problem

2569
01:36:04,630 --> 01:36:06,050
if he can't turn some of this around.

2570
01:36:06,050 --> 01:36:08,020
And I think that's what
candidates like Harris

2571
01:36:08,020 --> 01:36:09,830
and others saw as an opening,

2572
01:36:09,830 --> 01:36:11,830
this sort of tone deafness on some issues

2573
01:36:11,830 --> 01:36:14,560
that are very powerful and
real for younger voters,

2574
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:16,440
for minority voters, for women voters.

2575
01:36:16,440 --> 01:36:17,380
He has a very strong support

2576
01:36:17,380 --> 01:36:18,630
in the African-American community,

2577
01:36:18,630 --> 01:36:21,310
he's polling super well in
places like South Carolina,

2578
01:36:21,310 --> 01:36:23,640
but I think she wants to chip away at that

2579
01:36:23,640 --> 01:36:25,390
and that's exactly why she went after him

2580
01:36:25,390 --> 01:36:26,958
on that particular issue.

2581
01:36:26,958 --> 01:36:29,710
- Joseph, the President has not said much

2582
01:36:29,710 --> 01:36:31,070
about Kamala Harris

2583
01:36:31,070 --> 01:36:33,570
and normally that could
be a sign he's worried,

2584
01:36:33,570 --> 01:36:37,100
or it could be that he hopes
that Joe Biden rights the ship

2585
01:36:37,100 --> 01:36:38,670
because he's got all these monikers,

2586
01:36:38,670 --> 01:36:40,587
like Sleepy Joe--
- Sleepy Joe.

2587
01:36:40,587 --> 01:36:41,420
- And all this other stuff.

2588
01:36:41,420 --> 01:36:42,410
But what is goin' there?

2589
01:36:42,410 --> 01:36:44,120
- Look, I think that the
President recognizes,

2590
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:45,900
as most of us do, that if you're talkin'

2591
01:36:45,900 --> 01:36:47,130
about strictly demographics,

2592
01:36:47,130 --> 01:36:49,260
Joe Biden causes the greatest threat

2593
01:36:49,260 --> 01:36:50,820
to his pathway to reelection.

2594
01:36:50,820 --> 01:36:51,653
I think what a lot of people--

2595
01:36:51,653 --> 01:36:53,160
- [Neil] What did he
keep stumbling like this?

2596
01:36:53,160 --> 01:36:54,610
All of a sudden he's not such a threat.

2597
01:36:54,610 --> 01:36:56,470
- Well, I think, look, he
has to come out swingin',

2598
01:36:56,470 --> 01:36:58,670
I think that in order to
hold on to his support,

2599
01:36:58,670 --> 01:36:59,910
particularly in communities of color,

2600
01:36:59,910 --> 01:37:01,640
he actually must be prepared to lose it.

2601
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:03,757
I think that that means that
he has to protect his record

2602
01:37:03,757 --> 01:37:05,120
and not that I'm givin' them advice,

2603
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:07,790
but say to look, for the
record, busing didn't work,

2604
01:37:07,790 --> 01:37:09,550
we've got schools today
that they're more segregated

2605
01:37:09,550 --> 01:37:11,010
than they were during Jim Crow South.

2606
01:37:11,010 --> 01:37:12,260
You know, he has to be prepared to say

2607
01:37:12,260 --> 01:37:15,570
that this woman, who is a
senator, who I have respect for,

2608
01:37:15,570 --> 01:37:17,220
came out with an attack on an issue

2609
01:37:17,220 --> 01:37:18,640
which she basically agrees with me on,

2610
01:37:18,640 --> 01:37:20,020
for the purpose of selling t-shirts.

2611
01:37:20,020 --> 01:37:22,360
- [Kat] Just needs to be prepared period.

2612
01:37:22,360 --> 01:37:23,310
I just don't--
- And he wasn't.

2613
01:37:23,310 --> 01:37:24,387
- I don't understand--
- He was prepared

2614
01:37:24,387 --> 01:37:26,440
for questions about whether you pal around

2615
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:29,530
with segregationists, but
apparently not for busing.

2616
01:37:29,530 --> 01:37:30,570
- What was he doing then?

2617
01:37:30,570 --> 01:37:32,490
Because if you think about it, back then,

2618
01:37:32,490 --> 01:37:34,410
he's been out there a
little bit more lately,

2619
01:37:34,410 --> 01:37:35,610
but right before the debates,

2620
01:37:35,610 --> 01:37:37,860
he wasn't making public appearances,

2621
01:37:37,860 --> 01:37:39,850
he was doing, I don't know,

2622
01:37:39,850 --> 01:37:42,560
because he didn't look
prepared for the debate either.

2623
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:43,990
I don't know if he was watchin' cat videos

2624
01:37:43,990 --> 01:37:46,670
on the internet or playin'
Candy Crush, takin' naps,

2625
01:37:46,670 --> 01:37:49,640
I don't know, but I don't understand

2626
01:37:49,640 --> 01:37:50,473
why you wouldn't be prepared--

2627
01:37:50,473 --> 01:37:51,736
- [Neil] Wouldn't that be cool if he was--

2628
01:37:51,736 --> 01:37:52,746
- He was--
- Like up there and actually

2629
01:37:52,746 --> 01:37:53,760
playing Candy Crush.
- Maybe he's addicted

2630
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:54,786
to Candy Crush.

2631
01:37:54,786 --> 01:37:57,500
Maybe I just figured it out and
that's why he did so poorly.

2632
01:37:57,500 --> 01:38:00,700
I don't know, but I would
think that if you were gonna be

2633
01:38:00,700 --> 01:38:03,200
in front of millions
of people watching you,

2634
01:38:03,200 --> 01:38:04,830
you'd wanna do your homework.

2635
01:38:04,830 --> 01:38:06,160
Just to not embarrass yourself.

2636
01:38:06,160 --> 01:38:08,440
- In fairness, look, he's
has a lifetime of experience

2637
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:09,598
and I'm sure he counted--
- He admitted

2638
01:38:09,598 --> 01:38:10,578
he wasn't prepared, though.
- On that.

2639
01:38:10,578 --> 01:38:12,320
And he admitted he wasn't--
- He admitted that.

2640
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:14,210
- Look, he clearly had a bad night.

2641
01:38:14,210 --> 01:38:16,740
The reality is, is it
is incredibly difficult

2642
01:38:16,740 --> 01:38:18,910
to sit at the top of the polls
when you've got 24 people

2643
01:38:18,910 --> 01:38:21,235
behind you chasing you
and who are gonna dig into

2644
01:38:21,235 --> 01:38:22,220
every piece of his record--
- 'Cause look at Jeb Bush,

2645
01:38:22,220 --> 01:38:23,053
he was at the top--
- Yeah, I mean--

2646
01:38:23,053 --> 01:38:24,050
- Of the polls and it evaporated.

2647
01:38:24,050 --> 01:38:25,060
- It not a good place--
- Please clap.

2648
01:38:25,060 --> 01:38:25,940
- To be this early.

2649
01:38:25,940 --> 01:38:26,773
Yeah, I mean, please clap.
(Kat laughs)

2650
01:38:26,773 --> 01:38:28,213
I mean he sorta had that moment.

2651
01:38:28,213 --> 01:38:30,478
It's not a place to be and
I've said from the beginning,

2652
01:38:30,478 --> 01:38:33,160
I think his numbers are
gonna continue to fall

2653
01:38:33,160 --> 01:38:34,410
before they come back up.

2654
01:38:34,410 --> 01:38:37,300
Look, Democrats have an
enormous field of choices,

2655
01:38:37,300 --> 01:38:39,770
an enormous set of issues to explore.

2656
01:38:39,770 --> 01:38:41,470
There is a whole new generation of voters

2657
01:38:41,470 --> 01:38:43,840
who don't have the history
with him, that don't feel a set

2658
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:44,777
of connections with him--
- Yeah, they don't know it

2659
01:38:44,777 --> 01:38:46,519
and like a passing ship in the night.

2660
01:38:46,519 --> 01:38:49,140
One of the things he said--
- They don't.

2661
01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:50,500
Listen, the key to this election,

2662
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:52,380
it's not just about the
primary vote, right,

2663
01:38:52,380 --> 01:38:54,940
what's gonna turn 2020
for the Democrats is going

2664
01:38:54,940 --> 01:38:57,910
to be enthusiasm and energy of new voters,

2665
01:38:57,910 --> 01:38:59,769
Gen Z, Gen Y--
- And they don't have it

2666
01:38:59,769 --> 01:39:00,890
for him.
- Women and people of color,

2667
01:39:00,890 --> 01:39:01,723
they have no history with him.

2668
01:39:01,723 --> 01:39:03,250
- Let me ask you about where
the path of the party lies

2669
01:39:03,250 --> 01:39:04,400
and Joe Biden was saying

2670
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:06,760
of Representative
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,

2671
01:39:06,760 --> 01:39:08,687
I'll ask you about this Joe,

2672
01:39:08,687 --> 01:39:11,390
"She's bright and brilliant,
but too far left."

2673
01:39:11,390 --> 01:39:14,280
In other words saying, our gains have come

2674
01:39:14,280 --> 01:39:17,430
from more moderate
victories, and he's right.

2675
01:39:17,430 --> 01:39:19,780
Of the 40, I guess, who
were elected to the House,

2676
01:39:19,780 --> 01:39:21,950
I think 32 fit the moderate label,

2677
01:39:21,950 --> 01:39:23,610
that might be over-generalizing it

2678
01:39:23,610 --> 01:39:25,820
and not the Ocasio-Cortez label.

2679
01:39:25,820 --> 01:39:29,940
But did in so saying that,
did he kinda bury himself?

2680
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:31,800
- No, I think that he's
speakin' the truth.

2681
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:33,960
Now having said that, that
give him some trepidations

2682
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:36,170
and difficulties getting
through this primary process,

2683
01:39:36,170 --> 01:39:37,920
but the fact remains is that only people

2684
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:40,710
who are talkin' about this
Democratic party expanding left,

2685
01:39:40,710 --> 01:39:42,040
faster than the universe expands,

2686
01:39:42,040 --> 01:39:43,210
are people who live in districts

2687
01:39:43,210 --> 01:39:44,950
that they couldn't lose
even if they are runnin'

2688
01:39:44,950 --> 01:39:45,783
against a guy who--

2689
01:39:45,783 --> 01:39:48,050
- [Neil] So you are arguing that he,

2690
01:39:48,050 --> 01:39:50,010
when he says he's worried
about the party moving too,

2691
01:39:50,010 --> 01:39:53,220
too far left and promises
Medicare-for-all,

2692
01:39:53,220 --> 01:39:56,900
college education, college
debt, rights for illegals

2693
01:39:56,900 --> 01:39:59,260
and all that, that that isn't even in sync

2694
01:39:59,260 --> 01:40:00,210
with his Democratic base?

2695
01:40:00,210 --> 01:40:02,000
- I would say that it's 100% the fact

2696
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:05,140
that he's basically on
the post of the party,

2697
01:40:05,140 --> 01:40:06,790
more so than what AOC's talkin' about.

2698
01:40:06,790 --> 01:40:08,130
That's why he's the front-runner,

2699
01:40:08,130 --> 01:40:09,770
in spite of his performance.
- I don't know if that's true.

2700
01:40:09,770 --> 01:40:10,603
- I don't know, I don't know about that

2701
01:40:10,603 --> 01:40:13,410
because look at after the
debates, he lost so much support

2702
01:40:13,410 --> 01:40:15,410
and Elizabeth Warren
gained a lot of support

2703
01:40:15,410 --> 01:40:16,700
and she is very, very progressive.

2704
01:40:16,700 --> 01:40:19,510
Plus, we also know that
primary voters tend

2705
01:40:19,510 --> 01:40:21,061
to be more progressive than people votin'

2706
01:40:21,061 --> 01:40:24,269
in general elections, so
we might wind up with the--

2707
01:40:24,269 --> 01:40:25,532
- Well, Republican primary voters tend

2708
01:40:25,532 --> 01:40:26,937
to be more conservative in that, right?

2709
01:40:26,937 --> 01:40:27,770
- Absolutely, yes.

2710
01:40:27,770 --> 01:40:30,400
- He's tryin' to run a general
election during a primary

2711
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:32,207
and that's--
- And he hasn't won it yet.

2712
01:40:32,207 --> 01:40:33,040
- And he hasn't won it yet.

2713
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:36,580
He tried to equivocate on
that in the CNN interview,

2714
01:40:36,580 --> 01:40:38,360
that he doesn't want to be
presumptuous, et cetera,

2715
01:40:38,360 --> 01:40:39,500
which he clearly--
- Well, you want the Democrat

2716
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:41,060
to win, whoever it is, right?

2717
01:40:41,060 --> 01:40:42,580
So do you get concerned

2718
01:40:42,580 --> 01:40:44,680
that they could be
spoiling it for themselves,

2719
01:40:44,680 --> 01:40:46,280
offering things and promises

2720
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:49,270
and proposals that even
the Democratic voter

2721
01:40:49,270 --> 01:40:50,103
in this country doesn't support?

2722
01:40:50,103 --> 01:40:51,330
- You know, I really don't, I don't

2723
01:40:51,330 --> 01:40:52,720
and I don't because I think, look,

2724
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:54,850
what is the point of a primary
in an environment like this?

2725
01:40:54,850 --> 01:40:56,420
It's a battle of ideas.

2726
01:40:56,420 --> 01:40:59,400
Ultimately, there's gonna
be ideas far to the left,

2727
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:00,233
somewhere in the middle

2728
01:41:00,233 --> 01:41:01,270
and then they're gonna land somewhere

2729
01:41:01,270 --> 01:41:02,680
that's more in line with
the American people,

2730
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:04,250
but I think it's a valuable process.

2731
01:41:04,250 --> 01:41:05,230
That's why I actually,

2732
01:41:05,230 --> 01:41:06,990
I don't agree with a lot
of the people on the left

2733
01:41:06,990 --> 01:41:09,070
who say we need to cull
the field so quickly.

2734
01:41:09,070 --> 01:41:11,710
There is a benefit to the whole country

2735
01:41:11,710 --> 01:41:13,130
when you've got a lot of really qualified,

2736
01:41:13,130 --> 01:41:15,190
experienced people debating
a whole set of ideas

2737
01:41:15,190 --> 01:41:16,180
about the future of the country.

2738
01:41:16,180 --> 01:41:18,600
So I think it will swing
back towards the center

2739
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:19,960
as we get closer to the nomination,

2740
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:22,803
but I think he's wrong
to sort of hold this.

2741
01:41:25,257 --> 01:41:27,030
Kat's right, he's gonna
alienate a lot of the people

2742
01:41:27,030 --> 01:41:29,657
that he really needs to turn
out for him in the primaries

2743
01:41:29,657 --> 01:41:30,680
if he's gonna win.
- I disagree.

2744
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:31,520
I think that, again,

2745
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:33,220
Joe Biden is playin' a game right now

2746
01:41:33,220 --> 01:41:34,590
where he believes that's
he's goin' to depend

2747
01:41:34,590 --> 01:41:36,020
on reliable voters.

2748
01:41:36,020 --> 01:41:38,420
Reliable voters are older
voters, they're older,

2749
01:41:38,420 --> 01:41:40,590
black voters, those are the
people that he's talkin' to,

2750
01:41:40,590 --> 01:41:41,423
his performance, notwithstandin'.

2751
01:41:41,423 --> 01:41:44,077
I think that he fell because
he didn't do a very good job.

2752
01:41:44,077 --> 01:41:45,387
- He had a bad night.
- He kinda stunk.

2753
01:41:45,387 --> 01:41:47,356
- [Kat] An understatement that
he didn't do a very good job.

2754
01:41:47,356 --> 01:41:48,357
- [Neil] Maybe he's
just a lousy candidate.

2755
01:41:48,357 --> 01:41:49,240
- But I think if you look at it,

2756
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:50,900
if look at Elizabeth Warren rising,

2757
01:41:50,900 --> 01:41:53,250
I think that she's rising, not
on the strength of Joe Biden,

2758
01:41:53,250 --> 01:41:54,083
but on the strengths of the fact

2759
01:41:54,083 --> 01:41:55,320
that people remember remember it now

2760
01:41:55,320 --> 01:41:56,670
that she is the original person

2761
01:41:56,670 --> 01:41:58,660
when it comes to those
trillion dollar giveaways,

2762
01:41:58,660 --> 01:42:01,328
she is the one with the plans
towards Bernie's rhetoric

2763
01:42:01,328 --> 01:42:04,070
and I think that you see
Kamala Harris going after Biden

2764
01:42:04,070 --> 01:42:07,130
because she realizes that her
path to getting more money

2765
01:42:07,130 --> 01:42:09,120
and her path to actually
rise in the polls goes

2766
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:09,953
directly through Joe Biden.
- Well that's the danger

2767
01:42:09,953 --> 01:42:11,700
of bein' on top, right.
- Yep.

2768
01:42:11,700 --> 01:42:12,533
- The danger of bein' on top.

2769
01:42:12,533 --> 01:42:13,570
Guys, I wanna thank you,

2770
01:42:13,570 --> 01:42:16,290
thank you for coming in
on a very hot Saturday,

2771
01:42:16,290 --> 01:42:17,390
we appreciate that.

2772
01:42:17,390 --> 01:42:19,340

to pack the Supreme Court?

of the Federal Reserve,

2855
01:45:37,200 --> 01:45:39,677
blasting in a two-part
Tweet saying in part,

2856
01:45:39,677 --> 01:45:41,897
"Strong jobs report, low
inflation and other countries

"around the world doing anything possible

"knowing that our Federal
Reserve doesn't have clue!

Then, to rub a little
more salt in the wound,

2863
01:45:54,740 --> 01:45:56,977
saying that, "Our most
difficult problem is not

"our competitors, it is
the Federal Reserve!"

and Heritage Foundation

2867
01:46:05,420 --> 01:46:08,270
He will not let go of
this, is that hurting him?

2868
01:46:08,270 --> 01:46:09,550
What do you think?

2869
01:46:09,550 --> 01:46:10,973
- Well, let me start by saying this,

2870
01:46:10,973 --> 01:46:12,880
when I was driving in this morning, Neil,

2871
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:14,140
I was thinking that,

2872
01:46:14,140 --> 01:46:15,680
I think you and I are about the same age,

2873
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:18,840
this may be the best economy
we've seen in our lifetime.

2874
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:21,490
And when you've got the
lowest unemployment rate

2875
01:46:21,490 --> 01:46:24,810
in 50 years, you've got no
inflation, you got rising wages,

2876
01:46:24,810 --> 01:46:27,800
you got 7 1/2 million more
jobs than people to fill them,

2877
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:30,800
the stock market is now officially up 50%

2878
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:32,620
since Donald Trump was elected--

2879
01:46:32,620 --> 01:46:34,477
- So he's blaming the Fed
that it could be a lot higher

2880
01:46:34,477 --> 01:46:37,061
and by the way, I had no
idea you were 39, touche.

2881
01:46:37,061 --> 01:46:37,894
(Steve laughs)

2882
01:46:37,894 --> 01:46:39,082
But what do you make of that--
- You're a little younger

2883
01:46:39,082 --> 01:46:40,540
than I am! (laughs)

2884
01:46:40,540 --> 01:46:41,373
- He just won't let go.
- But no, look,

2885
01:46:41,373 --> 01:46:45,038
the reason I say that, Neil,
as prefaced your question,

2886
01:46:45,038 --> 01:46:47,090
isn't it about time we started giving

2887
01:46:47,090 --> 01:46:48,510
this guy the benefit of the doubt.

2888
01:46:48,510 --> 01:46:50,437
I mean, I remember during the
campaign, workin' for Trump,

2889
01:46:50,437 --> 01:46:52,170
and people said if
Donald Trump is elected,

2890
01:46:52,170 --> 01:46:53,810
we're gonna get us a
second Great Depression,

2891
01:46:53,810 --> 01:46:55,780
now we got the best economy in 50 years.

2892
01:46:55,780 --> 01:46:59,110
And so, I think Trump, I've
talked to him so many times

2893
01:46:59,110 --> 01:47:01,990
about this, Neil, he is
frustrated by the Fed.

2894
01:47:01,990 --> 01:47:03,540
That's one of the reasons he nominated me,

2895
01:47:03,540 --> 01:47:05,850
I think the Fed is too tight, as well.

2896
01:47:05,850 --> 01:47:06,698
I think that the Fed--

2897
01:47:06,698 --> 01:47:07,550
- [Neil] Well now he's naming two people--

2898
01:47:07,550 --> 01:47:10,090
- I know, Judy Shel--
- The interpretation is that

2899
01:47:10,090 --> 01:47:12,691
they'll do his bidding and
that they agree with him,

2900
01:47:12,691 --> 01:47:13,524
what do you think of that?

2901
01:47:13,524 --> 01:47:15,640
- They share his vision of the economy.

2902
01:47:15,640 --> 01:47:17,540
Here's the problem with the Fed

2903
01:47:17,540 --> 01:47:19,470
and this has been a
problem not just recently,

2904
01:47:19,470 --> 01:47:20,450
but for 30 years.

2905
01:47:20,450 --> 01:47:24,840
The Fed believes that if you
get too many people working,

2906
01:47:24,840 --> 01:47:27,440
too much growth, wages rising,

2907
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:29,130
somehow they have to snuff that out.

2908
01:47:29,130 --> 01:47:31,100
And Donald Trump, from
the first time I met him,

2909
01:47:31,100 --> 01:47:32,527
he said, "We're gonna
get this economy moving

2910
01:47:32,527 --> 01:47:34,890
"at three to 4% per year,

2911
01:47:34,890 --> 01:47:36,740
way up from what we had under Obama,"

2912
01:47:36,740 --> 01:47:38,330
and his frustration is, Neil,

2913
01:47:38,330 --> 01:47:40,780
every time we get a good jobs report,

2914
01:47:40,780 --> 01:47:43,370
or every time the growth
comes up where wages rise,

2915
01:47:43,370 --> 01:47:47,210
the Fed wants to pull it back.

2916
01:47:47,210 --> 01:47:50,640
I think that's wrong-headed,
we can grow this economy

2917
01:47:50,640 --> 01:47:53,020
without inflation faster and
Trump is right about this--

2918
01:47:53,020 --> 01:47:54,557
- Do you worry, though, and
I get where you're coming

2919
01:47:54,557 --> 01:47:55,677
and I get where the President's coming,

2920
01:47:55,677 --> 01:47:57,663
he was proven right on
that demands to the Fed

2921
01:47:57,663 --> 01:47:59,780
when he did because they did go too far--

2922
01:47:59,780 --> 01:48:00,900
- That's exactly right!

2923
01:48:00,900 --> 01:48:03,470
- But having said that, does he recognize

2924
01:48:03,470 --> 01:48:06,067
how weird it sounds to
love a robust economy

2925
01:48:06,067 --> 01:48:09,200
and a strong jobs report and
still advocate for lower rates?

2926
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:10,630
It's like an oxymoron.

2927
01:48:10,630 --> 01:48:11,610
- No, it isn't.

2928
01:48:11,610 --> 01:48:13,760
We think the economy can grow even faster.

2929
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:15,770
I mean the economy, probably
in the second quarter,

2930
01:48:15,770 --> 01:48:18,370
we're only gonna get about 2% growth.

2931
01:48:18,370 --> 01:48:20,250
The economy should be
growing at three to four,

2932
01:48:20,250 --> 01:48:23,140
by the way, if he gets that
trade deal done with China

2933
01:48:23,140 --> 01:48:26,623
and he gets the rate cut from
the Fed that we want in July,

2934
01:48:28,488 --> 01:48:29,560
if you think the economy's strong now,

2935
01:48:29,560 --> 01:48:30,590
wait until that happens.

2936
01:48:30,590 --> 01:48:32,800
So we just have a different model in mind.

2937
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:35,810
We think the capacity of the U.S. economy

2938
01:48:35,810 --> 01:48:38,010
to grow faster, for
more jobs to be created,

2939
01:48:38,010 --> 01:48:39,910
more people in the
workforce is a lot faster.

2940
01:48:39,910 --> 01:48:42,180
I mean, remember, Larry
Summers who was Bill Clinton

2941
01:48:42,180 --> 01:48:46,027
and Barack Obama's economist,
before the election said,

2942
01:48:46,027 --> 01:48:49,237
"The top-most growth we can
get in this country is 2%."

2943
01:48:49,237 --> 01:48:50,070
remember that second year stagnation--

2944
01:48:50,070 --> 01:48:50,903
- [Neil] No, you're absolutely right,

2945
01:48:50,903 --> 01:48:51,736
you're absolutely right.
- And we're saying,

2946
01:48:51,736 --> 01:48:52,910
no, we're throwin' that model out!

2947
01:48:52,910 --> 01:48:54,810
We gonna grow this economy faster,

2948
01:48:54,810 --> 01:48:56,910
it's gonna have a very positive effect.

2949
01:48:56,910 --> 01:48:59,400
By the way, low inflation,
low unemployment

2950
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:02,220
and how 'bout that, 50%
increase in the stock market,

2951
01:49:02,220 --> 01:49:03,250
that's $10 trillion of new wealth!

2952
01:49:03,250 --> 01:49:05,440
- Since he was elected, that's very true.

2953
01:49:05,440 --> 01:49:06,820
- There ya go.
- All right, Steve Moore,

2954
01:49:06,820 --> 01:49:09,024
great wisdom for a 39-year-old
man, I appreciate that.

2955
01:49:09,024 --> 01:49:10,121
(Steve laughs)

2956
01:49:10,121 --> 01:49:11,024
Have a great weekend, my friend.

2957
01:49:11,024 --> 01:49:11,857
- Have a great weekend.

2958
01:49:11,857 --> 01:49:12,690
You, too.
- Steve Moore.

2959
01:49:12,690 --> 01:49:13,810
All right, a lot more coming up after this

2960
01:49:13,810 --> 01:49:18,340
and then ask this question,
millennials leaving cities

2961
01:49:18,340 --> 01:49:22,240
so financially tight
that they can't make it

2962
01:49:22,240 --> 01:49:23,230
in the big city.

2963
01:49:23,230 --> 01:49:24,320
What is that saying?

2964
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:25,153
After this.

2965
01:49:28,370 --> 01:49:30,260
- [Man] With my Hepatitis
C, I felt I couldn't be

2966
01:49:30,260 --> 01:49:32,050
at my best for my family.

2967
01:49:32,050 --> 01:49:34,950
In only eight weeks with
MAVYRET, I was cured

2968
01:49:34,950 --> 01:49:36,880
and left those doubts behind.

2969
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:40,180
- [Female] I faced reminders
of my Hep C every day,

2970
01:49:40,180 --> 01:49:43,750
but in only eight weeks
with MAVYRET, I was cured.

2971
01:49:43,750 --> 01:49:46,470
- [Man] Even hanging with
friends, I worried about my Hep C,

2972
01:49:46,470 --> 01:49:49,210
but in only eight weeks
with MAVYRET, I was cured.

2973
01:49:49,210 --> 01:49:51,180
- [Announcer] MAVYRET is
the only eight-week cure

2974
01:49:51,180 --> 01:49:53,130
for all common types of Hep C.

2975
01:49:53,130 --> 01:49:55,080
Before starting MAVYRET
your doctor will test

2976
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:57,160
if you've had Hepatitis
B, which may flare up

2977
01:49:57,160 --> 01:49:59,860
and cause serious liver problems
during and after treatment.

2978
01:49:59,860 --> 01:50:02,000
Tell you doctor if you've had Hepatitis B,

2979
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,530
a liver or kidney transplant,
other liver problems,

2980

HIV-1, or other medical conditions

2981
01:50:06,830 --> 01:50:09,330
and all medicines you take,
including herbal supplements.

2982
01:50:09,330 --> 01:50:11,800
Don't take MAVYRET with
atazanavir or rifampin,

2983
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:13,500
or if you've had certain liver problems.

2984
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:16,750
Common side effects include
headache and tiredness.

2985
01:50:16,750 --> 01:50:19,600
- With Hep C behind me, I feel free.

2986
01:50:19,600 --> 01:50:21,040
- Fearless.

2987
01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:23,723

back because I am cured.

- No, wrong move!

3037
01:52:24,390 --> 01:52:26,230
Old-fashioned bandages get dirty,

3038
01:52:26,230 --> 01:52:27,820
they can let in water and germs!

3039

- [Announcer] New-Skin,
rethink how you heal.

3044
01:52:39,600 --> 01:52:41,740
- They're young and restless
and now fleeing the big cities.

3045
01:52:41,740 --> 01:52:43,490
In a new report of the
Wall Street Journal,

3046
01:52:43,490 --> 01:52:46,390
it shows millennials are
getting out of the big cities

3047
01:52:46,390 --> 01:52:48,190
to escape the rising cost of living.

3048
01:52:48,190 --> 01:52:50,070
So is cheaper housing worth the switch

3049
01:52:50,070 --> 01:52:52,200
to the subs, or suburbs?

3050
01:52:52,200 --> 01:52:54,640
Back with us now is Erin
Gibbs, Jonas Max Ferris,

3051
01:52:54,640 --> 01:52:56,803
Deirdre Bolton, city residents all.

3052
01:52:58,192 --> 01:52:59,920
(laughs) I don't even
know if that's the case.

3053
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:01,300
Erin, what do ya think of this?

3054
01:53:01,300 --> 01:53:04,480
- Well, I think this'll be
good for logistic companies

3055
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:06,850
because they're gonna order
everything from Amazon still,

3056
01:53:06,850 --> 01:53:10,093
so I think that'll be
my stock market play.

3057
01:53:10,093 --> 01:53:11,750
It's gonna be great for FedEx--

3058
01:53:11,750 --> 01:53:12,624
- I love that about you,
you just find a way,

3059
01:53:12,624 --> 01:53:15,420
how can I profit off
this disturbing trend?

3060
01:53:15,420 --> 01:53:16,562
Jonas, what do you think?

3061
01:53:16,562 --> 01:53:18,010
- Is that where the
parents' basements are?

3062
01:53:18,010 --> 01:53:19,380
Is that why they're--

3063
01:53:19,380 --> 01:53:20,660
- They've moved up to the attic.

3064
01:53:20,660 --> 01:53:22,310
- I mean, look, I feel bad for millennials

3065
01:53:22,310 --> 01:53:25,870
because these cities, their
wealth is increasing faster

3066
01:53:25,870 --> 01:53:26,703
than their salaries.

3067
01:53:26,703 --> 01:53:28,300
They're entry-level workers in many cases

3068
01:53:28,300 --> 01:53:30,640
and they don't make enough to
keep up with the rising rents

3069
01:53:30,640 --> 01:53:32,090
because all the tech workers

3070
01:53:32,090 --> 01:53:34,270
and finance workers can pay higher rents.

3071
01:53:34,270 --> 01:53:35,520
So it's a tough situation,

3072
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:37,210
but I don't think they're
being creative enough.

3073
01:53:37,210 --> 01:53:40,600
I do hear some stories about
$1,200 pods they're moving into

3074
01:53:40,600 --> 01:53:43,040
and like more unique things,
living in vans and boats

3075
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:44,470
and they need to get creative.

3076
01:53:44,470 --> 01:53:45,830
You can't just run from the city,

3077
01:53:45,830 --> 01:53:47,220
that's where the income and the jobs are

3078
01:53:47,220 --> 01:53:48,293
and they're gonna try to save money

3079
01:53:48,293 --> 01:53:50,220
and be commuting three hours a day,

3080
01:53:50,220 --> 01:53:51,640
which isn't a good solution either.

3081
01:53:51,640 --> 01:53:54,570
- In fairness, the income
inequality really is growing.

3082
01:53:54,570 --> 01:53:56,360
I mean, we're sort of at a period in time

3083
01:53:56,360 --> 01:53:58,920
that I think hasn't been the
same since the late 1920s,

3084
01:53:58,920 --> 01:54:01,590
so I actually feel bad for
this group of kids, too.

3085
01:54:01,590 --> 01:54:03,770
Most of them do have student debt

3086
01:54:03,770 --> 01:54:05,460
and we know, outside of mortgage debt,

3087
01:54:05,460 --> 01:54:07,430
this is actually the biggest chunk

3088
01:54:07,430 --> 01:54:09,300
that Americans are carrying.

3089
01:54:09,300 --> 01:54:12,000
So there are a lot of factors
and I think you're right,

3090
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,700
it's still expensive to live in cities,

3091
01:54:13,700 --> 01:54:15,560
which is why sometimes--
- I wonder whether they take

3092
01:54:15,560 --> 01:54:17,380
that frustration out at the polls,

3093
01:54:17,380 --> 01:54:20,488
if it's palpable to the
degree you say it is, right?

3094
01:54:20,488 --> 01:54:22,720
- Well, I think that is part
of Senator Sanders appeal

3095
01:54:22,720 --> 01:54:26,050
or other leftist candidates,

3096
01:54:26,050 --> 01:54:27,810
especially that student debt forgiveness.

3097
01:54:27,810 --> 01:54:30,110
I mean if you ignore how
(laughs) we're gonna pay for it,

3098
01:54:30,110 --> 01:54:32,110
or any of the logistics behind that--

3099
01:54:32,110 --> 01:54:32,943
- [Neil] Tax Jonas.

3100
01:54:32,943 --> 01:54:34,810
- I think that message
resonates for a reason.

3101
01:54:34,810 --> 01:54:35,643
- I think it's a matter

3102
01:54:35,643 --> 01:54:36,520
of whether they show up
to the polls, though,

3103
01:54:36,520 --> 01:54:39,640
'cause we do see consistently
low rates in actually voting.

3104
01:54:39,640 --> 01:54:41,780
So they may have a very large voice,

3105
01:54:41,780 --> 01:54:43,360
but whether that actually carries forward

3106
01:54:43,360 --> 01:54:44,290
to the votes is a whole 'nother story.

3107
01:54:44,290 --> 01:54:47,210
- Do you think their frustrations
are justifiable, though,

3108
01:54:47,210 --> 01:54:49,710
that they're really going
through something here

3109
01:54:49,710 --> 01:54:52,460
that we, as a nation,
have to pay attention to?

3110
01:54:52,460 --> 01:54:55,213
If they're leaving the
city to this degree.

3111
01:54:56,490 --> 01:54:58,290
- I'm not clear, I haven't decided yet.

3112
01:54:58,290 --> 01:55:01,370
I haven't seen a big
enough economic shift,

3113
01:55:01,370 --> 01:55:02,770
at least in the markets,

3114
01:55:02,770 --> 01:55:04,840
where we don't see them not spending.

3115
01:55:04,840 --> 01:55:06,214
They're still buying the
iPhones, they're still--

3116
01:55:06,214 --> 01:55:07,743
- And I see a lot of young
people here in the city--

3117
01:55:07,743 --> 01:55:09,000
- Yes, so I'm still saying

3118
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
we're still seeing the consumer spending,

3119
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:14,290
so maybe I think it maybe
it's more of a value shift.

3120
01:55:14,290 --> 01:55:16,060
I don't see that consumer spending is

3121
01:55:16,060 --> 01:55:17,710
suddenly dropping off from millennials,

3122
01:55:17,710 --> 01:55:21,270
they still contribute an
enormous amount to the economy.

3123
01:55:21,270 --> 01:55:22,800
So I think it's a matter

3124
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:23,894
of value where they don't--
- Well they buy all,

3125
01:55:23,894 --> 01:55:25,170
the streaming services, right?
- Wanna pay for rent,

3126
01:55:25,170 --> 01:55:26,700
but they'll pay the streaming services.

3127
01:55:26,700 --> 01:55:29,160
So, from a Wall Street perspective,

3128
01:55:29,160 --> 01:55:31,190
I don't see them doing as poorly.

3129
01:55:31,190 --> 01:55:32,023
They're spending money.

3130
01:55:32,023 --> 01:55:33,920
- You know, it's funny, the
people that vote are the people

3131
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:35,716
in the rent-controlled apartments

3132
01:55:35,716 --> 01:55:38,270
that aren't even working
anymore or they're retired.

3133
01:55:38,270 --> 01:55:40,000
These are apartments they
moved in the '60s in New York,

3134
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,630
they're paying $200 a month
rent, hogging up space

3135
01:55:42,630 --> 01:55:43,520
that people--
- Makes me cry, yeah.

3136
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:45,100
- Who work have to commute two hours.

3137
01:55:45,100 --> 01:55:47,190
So it's actually a failed liberal policy

3138
01:55:47,190 --> 01:55:48,960
that has driven millennials out--

3139
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:50,620
- But that's kind of
a New York phenomenon,

3140
01:55:50,620 --> 01:55:51,670
not exclusively, right?

3141
01:55:51,670 --> 01:55:54,650
- San Francisco, you would
think it's an old '60s relic,

3142
01:55:54,650 --> 01:55:55,893
but I believe in Portland, Oregon

3143
01:55:55,893 --> 01:55:57,560
they just added rent control,

3144
01:55:57,560 --> 01:55:58,660
like that's a solution to this.

3145
01:55:58,660 --> 01:56:01,167
That only increases the problem
later, but it takes a while

3146
01:56:01,167 --> 01:56:02,467
and it seems like a thing people vote for.

3147
01:56:02,467 --> 01:56:04,710
- But in those hot cities,
especially for tech,

3148
01:56:04,710 --> 01:56:07,100
I saw something online and it was a shack

3149
01:56:07,100 --> 01:56:08,640
you would not leave a dog in,

3150
01:56:08,640 --> 01:56:11,540
and it was on a 1/4 of an
acre and it was $1.5 million,

3151
01:56:11,540 --> 01:56:13,100
but because it was in San Francisco.

3152
01:56:13,100 --> 01:56:15,960
So I do think it's hard
for millennials to come up

3153
01:56:15,960 --> 01:56:20,080
with $200,000 to put down as
a down payment in a house,

3154
01:56:20,080 --> 01:56:23,440
or an apartment in New
York City, San Francisco,

3155
01:56:23,440 --> 01:56:25,190
obviously there are cheaper cities--

3156
01:56:25,190 --> 01:56:26,023
- But isn't this rising--
- Austin, Texas.

3157
01:56:26,023 --> 01:56:28,930
- Economic tide lifting all boats, or no?

3158
01:56:28,930 --> 01:56:29,763
- For the most part, it is.

3159
01:56:29,763 --> 01:56:32,530
In fact, we see that when
it comes to wage growth,

3160
01:56:32,530 --> 01:56:35,603
when it comes to unemployment,
particularly with minorities.

3161
01:56:37,330 --> 01:56:39,780
We've seen just a massive rise

3162
01:56:39,780 --> 01:56:43,970
and more so with some of the
hardest hit demographics,

3163
01:56:43,970 --> 01:56:45,760
minority women, minorities in general,

3164
01:56:45,760 --> 01:56:47,130
have had some of the greatest rises.

3165
01:56:47,130 --> 01:56:49,330
So I think overall,
we're doing really well

3166
01:56:49,330 --> 01:56:51,130
and millennials are just,

3167
01:56:51,130 --> 01:56:53,080
I think they're really
just shifting their values.

3168
01:56:53,080 --> 01:56:55,160
They don't wanna pay as
much money for the cities,

3169
01:56:55,160 --> 01:56:56,200
they don't wanna pay as much rent--

3170
01:56:56,200 --> 01:56:57,033
- [Neil] Yeah, they've been burnt--

3171
01:56:57,033 --> 01:56:57,866
- But they still buy $100,000 iPhones.

3172
01:56:57,866 --> 01:56:58,810
- But they've been burnt by the meltdown,

3173
01:56:58,810 --> 01:57:00,053
they remember what their
parents went through

3174
01:57:00,053 --> 01:57:01,960
and may be very cautious.

3175
01:57:01,960 --> 01:57:02,793
Guys, I wanna thank you very much

3176
01:57:02,793 --> 01:57:06,580
for comin' in on a very
hot, humid Saturday

3177
01:57:06,580 --> 01:57:08,070
in the middle of July.

3178
01:57:08,070 --> 01:57:08,903
By the way,

3179
01:57:08,903 --> 01:57:11,380
we have the EPA Administrator
Andrew Wheeler joining us

3180
01:57:11,380 --> 01:57:13,400
on "Your World" 4:00 p.m. Eastern time.

3181
01:57:13,400 --> 01:57:16,350
Also, on FOX Business, we're
looking at the same issues

3182
01:57:16,350 --> 01:57:20,010
we did here about why the
young are feeling restless

3183
01:57:20,010 --> 01:57:21,420
and what happens to them

3184
01:57:21,420 --> 01:57:23,950
and how this election
could shape their minds.

3185
01:57:23,950 --> 01:57:26,690
All of that comin' up
next week, FOX continues--

3186
01:57:26,690 --> 01:57:30,600
- Using Ebates, I've earned $756.28.

3187

3199
01:57:58,330 --> 01:58:01,290

much smoother and clearer

3200
01:58:01,290 --> 01:58:02,900
and makeup goes on perfectly.

3201
01:58:02,900 --> 01:58:04,890
- My skin looks younger and healthier.

3202
01:58:04,890 --> 01:58:07,550
- My skin is instantly
brighter, it's amazing.

3203

- [Announcer] Now you can bring

3204
01:58:08,590 --> 01:58:11,440
professional-style
dermaplaning into your home

3205
01:58:11,440 --> 01:58:13,520
with Flawless DermaPlane Glo,

3206
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:16,670
the new exfoliating device
from Finishing Touch

3207
01:58:16,670 --> 01:58:20,120
that instantly transforms
your skin to a more radiant,

3208
01:58:20,120 --> 01:58:22,500
younger-looking complexion in minutes.

3209
01:58:22,500 --> 01:58:24,930
Flawless DermaPlane Glo instantly

3210
01:58:24,930 --> 01:58:28,380
and painlessly removes the
top layer of dry, dead skin

3211
01:58:28,380 --> 01:58:30,380
to reveal brighter, smoother,

3212
01:58:30,380 --> 01:58:33,610
younger-looking skin the
very first time you use it.

3213
01:58:33,610 --> 01:58:35,800
- Dermaplaning is the
most popular treatment

3214
01:58:35,800 --> 01:58:37,040
that my clients request.

3215
01:58:37,040 --> 01:58:38,860
The moment they get it, they are hooked,

3216
01:58:38,860 --> 01:58:39,810
you just can't get enough.

3217
01:58:39,810 --> 01:58:42,530
I love the DermaPlane Glo,
it's very user friendly,

3218
01:58:42,530 --> 01:58:45,490
it gives like a really
radiant, dewy-glow to the skin.

3219
01:58:45,490 --> 01:58:47,120
- I can't stop touching my face!

3220
01:58:47,120 --> 01:58:49,630
- [Announcer] An
easy-to-use contour design,

3221
01:58:49,630 --> 01:58:53,480
a professional-grade exfoliating
edge with safety guard

3222
01:58:53,480 --> 01:58:55,540
and just like a professional treatment,

3223
01:58:55,540 --> 01:58:58,810
a built-in LED light so
you never miss a spot.

3224
01:58:58,810 --> 01:59:00,390
- It's very easy to do.

3225
01:59:00,390 --> 01:59:03,090
- [Announcer] It's gentle
on all skin types and tones.

3226
01:59:03,090 --> 01:59:05,230
Your makeup will never look flawless

3227
01:59:05,230 --> 01:59:07,860
if it's sitting on top of
dead skin and peach fuzz,

3228
01:59:07,860 --> 01:59:10,340
but DermaPlane Glo exfoliates that layer

3229
01:59:10,340 --> 01:59:13,140
to create a smooth surface
for creams and makeup.

3230
01:59:13,140 --> 01:59:15,080
