1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,173
- Right back at y'all.

2
00:00:01,173 --> 00:00:02,850
- All right, we've got 30 seconds.

3
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,840
Final thoughts, Walt.
- You know, Fourth of July.

4
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,610
Think about it, look at the pictures.

5
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:08,390
Read the Declaration of Independence.

6
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:11,610
Remember what the Fourth of July is about

7
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,570
and the values that we hope to uphold.

8
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:14,403
- Kareen?

9
00:00:14,403 --> 00:00:15,360
- I was thinking the same thing.

10
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,310
We should not be politicizing
tomorrow, Fourth of July.

11
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:19,450
It's a day of independence,

12
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:23,060
it's a day of really knowing who we are

13
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:23,893
and remembering who we are.

14
00:00:23,893 --> 00:00:25,260
- We celebrate Fourth of July

15
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,260
in the midst of a serious moral crisis

16
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,760
which speaks to the
character of the country.

17
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,320
What will we do; who will we be?

18
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,920
- Meanwhile, the president
just on Twitter said

19
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,610
tomorrow will be, "The show
of a lifetime in Washington."

20
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:37,790
That does it for us this morning.

21
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:38,980
Have a great Fourth.

22
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,210
Chris Jansing picks up
our coverage right now.

23
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,490
- Quite a note to end on,
Willie Geist, thank you so much.

24
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:45,450
I am Chris Jansing, in
for Stephanie Ruhle,

25
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,860
and we begin with literal cries for help

26
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,310
from migrants detained
at the southern border,

27
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,150
fresh documentation directly contradicting

28
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,230
what the Trump Administration has said

29
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,330
that in fact show squalid
conditions at migrant centers

30
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:02,270
and that it's even more
widespread than we knew.

31
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,510
These disturbing and dangerous situations

32
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:05,840
detailed in a new report

33
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,710
from Homeland Security's
own inspector general

34
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:11,320
after surprise visits
to multiple facilities

35
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,010
in the Rio Grande Valley.

36
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,990
Those visits in June revealed
children without hot meals,

37
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,640
not allowed to shower,

38
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,910
detainees wearing the same
clothes for up to a month,

39
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,810
adults given only bologna
sandwiches to eat,

40
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,590
causing health problems.

41
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,850
Inspectors said that
when detainees saw them,

42
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:30,840
they banged on cell
windows and held up signs,

43
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,760
desperate for release.

44
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,340
One of those signs said,
"Help, 40 days here."

45
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,180
That would violate a federal court order

46
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,270
that migrants be held
no more than 72 hours.

47
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,200
A senior manager at one of the facilities

48
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,070
described the entire situation
as a "ticking time bomb."

49
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,500
Our award-winning immigration
reporter Jacob Soboroff

50
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,390
has seen some of these border
facilities with his own eyes,

51
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:57,770
but, wow, this report was,
even though we knew so much,

52
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:00,770
shocking to see it all there in one place.

53
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,120
Your reaction to this new report,

54
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,940
which cites immediate
health and safety concerns,

55
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,190
not at one or two, but
seven different sites.

56
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,680
- Yeah, Chris, you just read, I think,

57
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,460
what I believe to be the key phrase,

58
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,760
that this thing was a ticking time bomb.

59
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,110
And this is not just a
phrase that can be used

60
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,880
to describe the conditions
in those seven facilities

61
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,333
in the Rio Grande Valley.

62
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,810
The facility that I've been inside

63
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,140
is that central processing station there

64
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,330
in the Rio Grande Valley
where they separated more kids

65
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,040
than anywhere else along
the southern border.

66
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,260
They called it the epicenter.

67
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,740
A ticking time bomb
can be used to describe

68
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,330
the entire way that the Border Patrol

69
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,780
has been detaining migrants for decades.

70
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,720
These are prisons, jails,

71
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,750
and they treat migrants
as if they were prisoners,

72
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,790
as if they were criminals
coming into this country.

73
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,820
They've always been set
up as a system of intake,

74
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,930
jail processing-type stations,

75
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:53,980
where nobody's supposed to be there

76
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,500
for longer than 72 hours.

77
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,790
And it was only a matter of time

78
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,800
before they were going to see
another surge like they did

79
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,780
and like they are seeing along
the southern border today.

80
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,530
And what happens when you
have tens of thousands,

81
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,860
hundreds of thousands of
people coming into the country

82
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,470
and are being placed into tiny
little jail-like facilities

83
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,330
that are designed for single
adult males to be there

84
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,900
for an abbreviated period of time,

85
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,760
it's exactly what we're
seeing in this DHS OIG report

86
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,280
about the RGV sector,

87
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,260
and it's exactly what Julia
Ainsley and I reported

88
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,180
about what has been going on in El Paso

89
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,220
just a couple days ago.

90
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,240
- Yeah, so, a couple of weeks ago

91
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,380
was when this report was done,
this inspection was done.

92
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:36,200
And at the time, the DHS
said that it required

93
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,180
immediate attention and action,

94
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:42,220
so it sounds like, at
least in some instances,

95
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,550
there are no major changes
in the last couple of weeks.

96
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,460
Is that your read?

97
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,740
- The conditions are not
gonna get better quickly

98
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,730
in these facilities

99
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,710
when it comes to the facilities themselves

100
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,410
and the infrastructure that's down there.

101
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,270
I mean, that's the conversation
that's going on right now,

102
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,070
particularly amongst the Democrats:

103
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,380
What do you do about the
ways that this country

104
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,900
is holding migrants when
they come into this country?

105
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,160
But I will say, if there is
any bright spot in all of this,

106
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,350
just a couple months ago,
there were over 2,300,

107
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,130
Julia Ainsley reported this yesterday,

108
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,730
2,300 migrant children in the custody

109
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,380
of Customs and Border Protection

110
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,730
in facilities just like this.

111
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,960
As of yesterday, there were
only a couple of hundred

112
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,800
and they've been moved to facilities

113
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,500
that are operated by HHS in other areas,

114
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,180
not just of the southwest
border but across the country.

115
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,950
It doesn't mean that the
facilities are getting any better.

116
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,930
It means that the children, for now,

117
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,480
have been moved out, in large part,

118
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,670
at least according to what
Julia has learned from CBP.

119
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,500
- Yeah, I saw one report
that a baby was being held

120
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,110
in one of the places that was really cold

121
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,190
and actually their hands
and feet had turned blue,

122
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,970
so obviously there are
some serious problems here.

123
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,110
Jacob, you're gonna stay with me.

124
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,350
I wanna also bring in

125
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:53,240
Washington Post White House
bureau chief Phil Rucker,

126
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,110
Rick Tyler, a Republican strategist

127
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,260
and co-founder of Foundry Strategies,

128
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,360
Doug Thornell is a former DNC
senior advisor and principal

129
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,700
at the political consulting
firm SKDKnickerbocker.

130
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,270
So, Phil, we've now seen multiple reports

131
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,090
from Trump's own administration

132
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,120
citing these terrible conditions.

133
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,783
Is it changing the conversation
in the West Wing at all?

134
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,840
- Not much, Chris.

135
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,900
What we've not seen
from the administration

136
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,516
and from the president himself

137
00:05:19,516 --> 00:05:21,580
is real moral leadership on this

138
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,030
or a focus on the humanitarian crisis.

139
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,980
Rather, there's a focus on the numbers,

140
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,720
how many people are crossing the border,

141
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,960
how many people are being detained.

142
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,690
We're hearing from officials
in the administration

143
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:36,550
that those numbers have been
declining in recent weeks

144
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,130
from a high in May.

145
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,620
But we've not seen the president

146
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,500
really forcefully take
control of this issue

147
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,410
and talk about the humanitarian crisis

148
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,760
that we see playing out
that's so well-documented

149
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,870
in that IG report

150
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,310
and in the reporting
from people like Jacob.

151
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,820
- And it's a humanitarian crisis, Rick,

152
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,480
that is unfolding in the
middle of an election season.

153
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,750
But even DHS responded to this new report

154
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,130
by saying Congress's failure to act

155
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:04,510
is incentivizing illegal migration.

156
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,100
But do you believe anything will change

157
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,410
between now and the election

158
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,723
or has this issue just
become too politicized?

159
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:14,080
- Well, Chris, I'd like to step
back and put it in context.

160
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,170
This is a massive political failure

161
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:18,380
that has occurred over decades of time,

162
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,040
and both parties are to blame.

163
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:24,303
And I realize a Republican
administration is in charge now,

164
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:28,100
but, look, I agree with Chairman Nadler

165
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,810
that someone needs to be held accountable,

166
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:30,970
but I wanna be very careful.

167
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,720
Yes, we need to weed out the bad apples,

168
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,553
but I wanna be very careful

169
00:06:33,553 --> 00:06:36,070
about demonizing the Border Patrol,

170
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,190
'cause the problem is these facilities

171
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,030
that the Border Patrol is working with

172
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:43,180
are not designed to hold
families and a number of people

173
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,400
and especially children for
the time they're doing it.

174
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,830
And so, I have to say the bottom line is

175
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:52,830
if we are ill-equipped to
treat immigrants humanely,

176
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,713
then I would be for letting--
- Well, it's not 'if', is it?

177
00:06:54,713 --> 00:06:55,740
It's not if.

178
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,937
You can look at these pictures, Rick,

179
00:06:56,937 --> 00:06:59,090
and say they're not
being treated humanely.

180
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,860
They're being told to drink outta toilets.

181
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,190
Kids are freezing.

182
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,300
- Here's what I would say.

183
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,407
And if I were a member of
Congress, I would be saying,

184
00:07:06,407 --> 00:07:10,132
"We need to release the
majority of these people today."

185
00:07:10,132 --> 00:07:13,430
Maybe people who are known to be dangerous

186
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,640
would stay in detention,

187
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,280
but the majority of these
people need to be released today

188
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,620
because we cannot tolerate a country

189
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,870
that we are treating people so inhumanely.

190
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,110
- Well, I mean, we have 11,

191
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,740
11, Doug, of the candidates for president

192
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,130
are members of Congress,

193
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,210
but that ignores the fact

194
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:34,580
that ultimately the buck
stops with the president,

195
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,700
and it is the president
who put policies in place

196
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,360
that led us to where we are right now.

197
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,110
- Yeah, this report is
alarming, it's shocking.

198
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,990
A lotta the images we've seen
are alarming and shocking.

199
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:50,090
And I think it just highlights
how big of a failure

200
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:54,070
this White House's immigration policy is.

201
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,740
From top to bottom,

202
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,010
it's not keeping us
safer and it's inhumane.

203
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:02,330
And I think what we're
gonna see from Democrats

204
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,670
over the next few weeks,

205
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,270
I think there's gonna
be a hearing next week

206
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,280
in the Oversight Committee

207
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,800
where the CPB head will come and testify.

208
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,880
Democrats have also requested hundreds

209
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,070
if not thousands and
thousands of documents

210
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,880
from this administration on
their immigration policies,

211
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,160
and they've been met with no,

212
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,000
and the administration
has refused to turn over

213
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,400
a lotta this paperwork.

214
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,900
So, when the administration
blames Congress,

215
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,500
they're not cooperating with Congress

216
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,060
so that Congress can help solve this issue

217
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,260
with this administration.

218
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,880
So, the buck definitely stops with Trump,

219
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,780
and they're definitely
doing everything they can

220
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,300
to stonewall here.

221
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,100
- Yeah, in the meantime,
we just got, on Twitter,

222
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:45,170
from the acting DHS secretary, Jacob,

223
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,390
he just posted that he's
launching an investigation

224
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,180
into those Facebook postings

225
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,870
of the group of former
and current border agents.

226
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,880
What do you know about that?

227
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,260
- Well, what's gonna happen here

228
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,650
is another Office of Inspector
General investigation,

229
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:58,940
the same types of investigations

230
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,080
that have revealed the horrid conditions

231
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,530
in these Border Patrol stations.

232
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:04,490
And to hear that from Kevin McAleenan

233
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:05,590
is certainly reassuring.

234
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:08,440
But don't forget: Kevin
McAleenan also called conditions

235
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,970
inside these facilities unsubstantiated

236
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:13,590
as recently as last Friday.

237
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,020
So, I think it's important

238
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,660
that the department's
gonna look into this.

239
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:20,390
When you hear a culture of
9,500 Border Patrol agents

240
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,450
in a secret Facebook group,

241
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:24,920
this was some extraordinary
reporting from ProPublica,

242
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,490
talking in the way that they were,

243
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,830
it's hard not to give
credence to the allegations

244
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:32,500
that we hear coming out
of these facilities.

245
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,130
We've heard the reports from
the Democratic lawmakers

246
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,520
who were down there earlier this week.

247
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,420
I've seen certain conditions
down there with my own eyes.

248
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,450
And again, it's a
positive step, I suppose,

249
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,330
but it's certainly not gonna
alleviate what is happening,

250
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,240
as Rick said, right now down there.

251
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,510
- Yeah, and we just got a report,

252
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:54,150
I guess in the last 24 hours or so, Jacob,

253
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:57,800
that a young girl, I guess,

254
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,670
or a two-year-old apparently
drowned in the Rio Grande

255
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,660
after we saw that heartbreaking picture

256
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,820
of a father and his child.

257
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,980
- Yeah.

258
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,930
Again, this is another horrific story

259
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:15,220
of a family who just wanted
to escape their lives

260
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,760
where they were to come for a better life.

261
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,140
This reportedly was a Haitian national

262
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,680
with a child who was a Brazilian national

263
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,020
crossing the Rio Grande.

264
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,170
They were separated in the river

265
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:29,230
and a search is ongoing right
now by the Border Patrol.

266
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,810
If it turns out that this
child did not survive,

267
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:35,940
I want everybody to remember
that 7,000 people have died

268
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:39,070
trying to come into
this country since 1998.

269
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:42,930
The failures of our
border policy as Americans

270
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,020
have been systemic literally for decades

271
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,210
in Democratic and
Republican administrations.

272
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:49,720
No one has treated
migrants more inhumanely,

273
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,140
and take it from me who's seen it myself,

274
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,480
than the Trump Administration,

275
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,740
but this is a problem
that has been festering

276
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,470
literally for decades.

277
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:59,100
And now, finally, as far as I'm concerned,

278
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,690
it's refreshing, it's reassuring

279
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,560
to hear all of us debating how we fix it

280
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,920
so that this does not continue to happen.

281
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,680
- Yeah, well, depends on who the 'we' is,

282
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,790
because the president's
actually doubling down.

283
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,623
So you have--

284
00:11:11,623 --> 00:11:12,534
- There's no doubt about that, Chris.

285
00:11:12,534 --> 00:11:13,440
- Children who are dying, right,

286
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,990
you have these pictures
of people being held in,

287
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,620
reports that there are adults

288
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,590
who are literally in cells
that are so tightly packed

289
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,650
that they can't sit down,

290
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:27,170
they are standing-room-only
for a week at a time.

291
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:30,380
And yet, he's signaling more
detentions after tomorrow,

292
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,790
imposing fines on undocumented migrants

293
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,450
who don't show up for court.

294
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:39,330
Phil, I was thinking back to
when the First Lady went down

295
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:41,130
at the time of the family separation

296
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:41,963
and some people thought,

297
00:11:41,963 --> 00:11:46,297
"Well, maybe the First Lady and
Ivanka will impress upon him

298
00:11:46,297 --> 00:11:49,190
"the inhumanity of what's
happening down there."

299
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,950
But is there any scenario that you see,

300
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,880
having covered this president,
that suggests to you

301
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,860
that he will shy away from
this as a campaign issue?

302
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,040
- Not at all, Chris.

303
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,370
I mean, this is an issue
that the president believes

304
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,660
is a winning issue for him politically.

305
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,540
He believes that his tough
stance on illegal immigration

306
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,270
is what got him the
presidency in the first place,

307
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,000
it's what helped him defeat

308
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,110
all those other Republican challengers

309
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,890
in the 2016 primaries,

310
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:18,660
and he believes it's what's
gonna win him reelection.

311
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:22,050
It's why you hear him talk
about it at every single rally.

312
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,290
And his advisors say
that they hope this issue

313
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,700
stays in the headlines for every day

314
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,850
between now until Election Day.

315
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:32,080
And so, the First Lady
can try to put a spotlight

316
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,260
on the humanitarian issue,

317
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,710
although we've not seen
or heard anything from her

318
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,940
in the last few weeks here,
and Ivanka Trump can talk about

319
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,820
what she wants to talk about,
but the president believes

320
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,610
that this is how he wins reelection.

321
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,300

you could've fixed it with a pen.

391
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,300
Maybe you should take that pen

392
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,210
and use it to sign up with a
different insurance company.

hate the game, not the player?

This is a power play.

It's Tuesday in Washington.

416

- The wall is the sticking
point, not border security.

00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:05,950
Seven of the contenders are
barnstorming the state today,

427
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:08,400
while the latest Iowa poll is released,

428
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,300
mimicking what we've
seen in national polls

429
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,630
since the debates.

430
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,690
Kamala Harris is surging in Iowa,

431
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:17,140
jumping into second and closing
in on frontrunner Joe Biden.

432
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,530
Elizabeth Warren also
got a post-debate bump,

433
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:22,770
while Bernie Sanders
dropped to single digits.

434
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:24,730
Our road warriors are
out across the state:

435
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:26,270
Shaquille Brewster in Iowa City,

436
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:29,680
Vaughn Hilliard in Des Moines,
Garrett Haake in Sioux City.

437
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,610
So, Shaq, on one hand,

438
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:34,030
Bernie Sanders had a
strong fundraising quarter.

439
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,950
I read that more than 800 people

440
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,340
turned out for his rally
yesterday in Iowa City,

441
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:42,480
yet he is dropping, not
just in Iowa but nationally.

442
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,003
Is there any indication his
campaign is switching strategy?

443
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,410
- Well, his team is saying

444
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:51,240
that they are focusing on the strategy

445
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,883
of slowing building this
campaign from the ground up.

446
00:17:53,883 --> 00:17:56,130
And, of course, his team
is pointing to an ABC poll

447
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:57,070
that came out this morning

448
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,130
that shows his support
actually increasing,

449
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,510
ticking up just a few points.

450
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:04,290
His campaign manager had a
video briefing with supporters

451
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:05,820
or for supporters last night,

452
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,110
and in that briefing, he said
there'll be peaks and valleys,

453
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,650
but that they're going to stay the course.

454
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,590
But if you look at this trip to Iowa

455
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,860
that Senator Sanders is doing,

456
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,810
you notice a couple of subtle
shifts in his strategy.

457
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:18,360
Number one, his focus on retail politics.

458
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,770
So, there's not gonna be as many rallies

459
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:22,340
or traditional rallies that he has.

460
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,810
He's having ice cream socials,

461
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:25,920
though, as you probably saw last night,

462
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,430
he still gives long speeches
at those ice cream socials,

463
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:31,210
but he's also gonna be marching
in Fourth of July parades,

464
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,440
trying to meet with Iowans
and shake their hands

465
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,640
and enjoy this holiday with them.

466
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,320
But number two, he's
also gonna be focusing

467
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,440
on his ground game.

468
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,990
The campaign is opening three new offices

469
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,400
in the state of Iowa.

470
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,130
They're also going to be
highlighting their volunteer force.

471
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:45,963
They're trying to show

472
00:18:45,963 --> 00:18:47,970
that they have this grassroots support

473
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:52,810
that can deliver him to
victory come February 3rd

474
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:54,380
and come that caucus time.

475
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,130
So, they're focusing not
only on those rallies,

476
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:59,040
but also activating their supporters

477
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,640
and getting them out there,
as many candidates are here

478
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,970
and focused on getting those Iowa voters.

479
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:06,760
- Vaughn, the debate has
catapulted Kamala Harris,

480
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:10,220
who you're with, into serious
contention, but we also know,

481
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:13,800
history tells us that debate
bounces can be short-lived.

482
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,950
Have you seen any
adjustments to her campaign

483
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,230
to capitalize on this?

484
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:20,100
And then, I also wanna
know about her fundraising,

485
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,580
'cause we know she made
$2 million in 24 hours,

486
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,833
but we haven't seen her quarterly numbers.

487
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,930
- Yeah, we haven't seen
the quarterly numbers yet.

488
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:31,560
The campaign tells us that
they expect to release those

489
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,530
in the next couple days.

490
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:35,660
But in those first three days
after her debate performance,

491
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,020
the campaign raised more than $3 million

492
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,720
in just online donations.

493
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,230
She had multiple fundraising
events over in California

494
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,277
where she raised an additional $600,000,

495
00:19:45,277 --> 00:19:46,910
the campaign tells us.

496
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,277
And you asked the question,

497
00:19:48,277 --> 00:19:50,547
"What is the position of
this campaign right now

498
00:19:50,547 --> 00:19:51,490
"coming outta the debate."

499
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,260
And, well, the reality here in Iowa

500
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,770
is they now have 65 staffers,

501
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,050
paid staffers here on the ground in Iowa.

502
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:00,690
They looked at that
debate as an opportunity,

503
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,280
as being more than a debate bump,

504
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,150
but as an introduction of
Kamala Harris to the country.

505
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,170
They believe that this
summer was that moment

506
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,530
when people would start paying attention.

507
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:10,270
We are now, as of today,

508
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:12,710
seven months away from that Iowa Caucus.

509
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:13,840
And I asked Kamala Harris,

510
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,480
I was with her over in
California over the weekend,

511
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,870
I asked her on Sunday how she looked at

512
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,710
approaching this campaign going forward

513
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:23,340
and whether she was going
to take a measured approach

514
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,040
in continuing, as she would suggest,

515
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,890
prosecuting the case against
her Democratic opponents.

516
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:31,910
And she wavered in her answer
there, not answering directly.

517
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,867
And I followed up saying,
"Will you continue

518
00:20:33,867 --> 00:20:36,410
"to draw contrasts from
your Democratic opponents?"

519
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:39,300
And she was not eager to
respond to that question.

520
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,770
But when it comes to the
operation they have on the ground,

521
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,010
they're in place and she's gonna be here

522
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,150
over the next three days.

523
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,010
- All right, Garrett,

524
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:48,240
a number of other
candidates are there today.

525
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,000
Money and polls, two big things.

526
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,280
And I do always find it interesting

527
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,770
when the deadline comes
that some candidates,

528
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:57,570
usually the ones who have a great quarter,

529
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,520
get out there ahead of everything

530
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,360
and then the rest lag behind.

531
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,100
Any suggestion on when we'll see

532
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,940
some of these other numbers,
and what are they waiting for?

533
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:10,770
Beto O'Rourke seemed to suggest
yesterday he had no idea

534
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:14,200
how much money he had
raised in this last quarter.

535
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,280
- Yeah, I don't buy that
for one second, Chris.

536
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,430
I'm sure that he may not
know the exact total,

537
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:22,000
but these campaigns watch
their fundraising numbers

538
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,390
probably closer than they
watch their polling numbers.

539
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,870
The candidate would know
whether or not they're on track

540
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,640
to hit their quarterly goals
or not at the very least.

541
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,440
A lotta this is news cycle management.

542
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,690
You'll remember even, with
O'Rourke as an example,

543
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:35,940
in the first quarter, his campaign waited

544
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,860
and held their numbers over a weekend.

545
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,840
I don't remember the news event,

546
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,590
I think it was a terrorist
attack that had happened

547
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,930
on a Thursday or a Friday
or something of that nature.

548
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:44,170
They decided not to release 'em

549
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,990
'cause they didn't want it
to get caught up in the wash

550
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:47,410
or look like they were bragging.

551
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,470
So, let's look at the calendar
for the next few days.

552
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:50,870
If you're somebody who might wanna brag

553
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:52,650
about your fundraising numbers,

554
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:55,330
today's probably your last
chance to do it for a while.

555
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,060
So, perhaps somebody like a Joe Biden

556
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,010
could be potentially
releasing their numbers early,

557
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,000
but you get caught up
in this holiday weekend.

558
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,130
And for somebody who'd
like to bury those numbers

559
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:05,420
if they were disappointing,
not what you wanted 'em to be,

560
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,110
Fourth of July, 5 p.m.,

561
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,880
great time to release
your fundraising numbers.

562
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,050
Now, as to Iowa itself,

563
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:12,030
we do have a ton of candidates here today.

564
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,530
O'Rourke is here, Biden is
here, Klobuchar is here.

565
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:17,090
I'll be covering a Mayor
Pete Buttigieg event

566
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,210
later on tonight.

567
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:21,230
The bottom line with Iowa is
it is still the place to go

568
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:24,180
where you can move your poll
numbers with retail events,

569
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,820
where being on the ground

570
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:28,390
is thought of to be the best
way to make a difference.

571
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,010
And part of this is 'cause of these folks

572
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:31,410
that I've been calling super-voters,

573
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:33,390
the folks who come to every event.

574
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,880
And you see them in all the early states,

575
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,250
but particularly in Iowa,

576
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,350
you meet these folks who take
their roles so seriously.

577
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,740
Listen.

578
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,040
Simply naming them all can be a feat.

579
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,800
- Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth
Warren, Amy Klobuchar.

580
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,373
- Kamala Harris was there, Bernie Sanders,

581
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:52,380
Julian Castro, and Jay Inslee.

582
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,780
- Tim Ryan, John Delaney.

583
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:59,077
- Eric Swalwell, the
Williamson lady, O'Rourke.

584
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:00,490
- The list goes on.

585
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:02,410
But for the super-voters
of the early states,

586
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:04,890
meeting and questioning
the Democratic candidates

587
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:06,930
is a duty and a privilege.

588
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:08,640
How many of the Democratic candidates

589
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,610
have you gone to see so far?

590
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:12,710
- I think Biden will be 12.

591
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:14,080
- 12?!
- Yes.

592
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,240
- Voters in Iowa see the
most of the candidates,

593
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,170
with more than 150 total
events held in the state

594
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:20,960
in the month of May alone.

595
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,010
That gave Carol McGuire time
to meet nine candidates.

596
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:26,370
- I would love to see all 25.

597
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:28,670
I'll travel wherever we have to go.

598
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:30,880
- [Garrett] Some
super-voters have a cause.

599
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,480
- When I started in 2016, I was so angry.

600
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,030
- [Garrett] Brenda Bouchard
lost her husband to Alzheimer's.

601
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:39,140
She's asked 30 candidates
about their plans

602
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:42,270
to fight the disease over
the last two campaigns.

603
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:45,540
- Ultimately, my ideal outcome
would be that a candidate

604
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:48,220
would put out a policy around Alzheimer's.

605
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,760
- [Garrett] Some super-voters
are semi-professionals.

606
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,740
Anthony Geron in Nevada is an activist

607
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,470
with a group called Make the Road.

608
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,310
- I wanna be as educated as possible.

609
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,570
I don't wanna be caught off-guard.

610
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,260
- The ACLU trained Kevin Leuters,

611
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,760
who comes to events with
a list of questions.

612
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,010
What's your method to getting a candidate

613
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,120
to answer your question?

614
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,190
- Well, to corner them.

615
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:10,440
Usually, if there's a Q&A session,

616
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,326
my arm goes up quicker
than anybody else's.

617
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:15,094
- (laughing) The fastest draw in the West?

618
00:24:15,094 --> 00:24:16,490
- The fastest draw in the West.

619
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:17,890
I've been trained well.

620
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,350
- [Garrett] Marc Korver has no trouble

621
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,680
catching a candidate's eye

622
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,700
for a chance to get a signed baseball

623
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,530
and to get close to history in the making.

624
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:28,580
- To me, that's more important,
you personalize yourself,

625
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:31,500
'cause sometimes people think presidents

626
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,530
being larger than life.

627
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:35,590
This makes them, I say it
brings out a more human side.

628
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,240
- [Garrett] For all of these super-voters,

629
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,860
picking presidents is
a participatory sport.

630
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:43,580
Watching a debate isn't
enough; they want to shape it.

631
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,150
- I'm one of many voices.

632
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,950
But if I have a voice
here in New Hampshire,

633
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:49,660
I'm going to use it to
the best of my ability

634
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,860
to try to make a change.

635
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,860
- Chris, technology has
changed the game here too.

636
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,250
The ease of shooting a video

637
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,560
of your interaction with a candidate,

638
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,940
posting it on social media,

639
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,810
has given these
super-voters even more power

640
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:05,090
to shape the narrative, shape
the discussion in these races.

641
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:07,240
- Garrett Haake, who's
braving the rain for us

642
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,560
this morning in Sioux City,
Vaughn in the sunshine,

643
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,470
and Shaq's near a coffee pot,

644
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,970
so you tell me who's got it going on.

645
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,810
Thank you, gentlemen, appreciate it.

646
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:16,900
And up next,

647
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,530
the legal battle over
President Trump's tax returns

648
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:21,580
escalates to a whole new level,

649
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,990
with Democrats following through

650
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:25,563
on a potentially game-changing threat.

651
00:25:25,563 --> 00:25:28,520
(upbeat news music)

652
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,690

- [Announcer] When you
need a passionate start

654
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,153
to the morning--

655
00:25:33,153 --> 00:25:35,290
- Name one of the Democratic contenders,

656
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:38,380
name one that you are
positive can beat Trump.

weekdays at 6:00 on MSNBC.

659
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,270
- I have one kid in each
branch of the military,

660
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,740
but I'm command central.

661
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,260
- [Announcer] Why Elaine chose Verizon.

662
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,510
- It's so important to us

663
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:51,780
that Verizon is supporting
military families.

664
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,180
When I have a child deployed,

665
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,360
having a reliable
network means everything.

666
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,060
So, when I get a video chat
and I get to see their face,

667
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,270
it's the best thing in the world.

668
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:01,260
And I've earned every
one of these gray hairs.

669
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,350
Military moms, we serve too.

670
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,770
- [Announcer] The network
more people rely on

671
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:05,610
gives you more,

672
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:08,177
like military plans with a
special price on unlimited,

673
00:26:08,177 --> 00:26:09,670
$100 per line,

674
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:11,990
and big savings on our best
phones when you switch.

675
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:13,000
That's Verizon.

Just fill and chill.

698
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:58,240
Then lift out the inner cylinder

699
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,970
and empty the cubes into the bucket.

700
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:02,930
Ice Genie can hold up to
three batches of ice cubes.

701
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:05,460

734
00:28:05,213 --> 00:28:06,823
I'm thinking about a scuba diving trip.

735
00:28:06,823 --> 00:28:08,337
- [Operator] Ooh!

736
00:28:08,337 --> 00:28:09,210

737
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:10,770
- You okay?
- Yeah, no, I'm good.

738
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:11,603
- [Announcer] Paid spokesperson.

739
00:28:11,603 --> 00:28:14,640
- This is a legal alert for
users of Roundup weedkiller.

740
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,950
Roundup has been designated
as a probable human carcinogen

741
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,780
by the World Health Organization.

742
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:23,500
In July 2018, a judge determined
that all federal lawsuits

743
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,880
could move forward against Monsanto,

744
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,780
the maker of Roundup weedkiller,

745
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,920
over concerns that those exposed

746
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,780
are at risk for developing
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

747
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,680
Landscapers, those who work
in the landscaping industry,

748
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,660
farmers, and heavy
exposure residential users

749
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,340
where Roundup weedkiller is used

750
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:43,500
are at risk for developing
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

751
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,820
Roundup weedkiller is the
most commonly used weed killer

752
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,360
in American agriculture,

753
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,170
with an estimated 85 to 90
million pounds used each year.

754
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,940
If you or someone you love

755
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,620
has been diagnosed with
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma

756
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:59,010
after being exposed to Roundup
or a glyphosate herbicide,

757
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:00,960
you may be entitled to compensation.

758
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,540
How do you fight for the
compensation you deserve?

759
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,980
You choose the right legal team

760
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,030
that has the experience and resources

761
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:09,640
to seek the most compensation
for your injuries.

762
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,060
Call now.

763
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,063
- [Announcer] You save.

764
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:17,350
- Now to that big escalation

765
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:19,170
in the Congressional Democrats' fight

766
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:21,520
to see President Trump's taxes.

767
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,600
The House is suing the Treasury Department

768
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,870
and the Internal Revenue
Service over his returns

769
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:29,740
after their requests and
then subpoenas of the returns

770
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:32,540
was ignored by Treasury
Secretary Steve Mnuchin

771
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,920
and IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig.

772
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,700
So, the federal courts now get the case,

773
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,680
which could ultimately be
fought in the Supreme Court.

774
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,190
I'm joined now by Charlie
Savage, a New York Times reporter

775
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,730
who has been covering this for months

776
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:46,010
and is also an MSNBC contributor,

777
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:48,350
David K. Johnston, a Pulitzer
Prize-winning journalist

778
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,560
who has written multiple books

779
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,510
on the president and his administration.

780
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:53,280
He is an expert on tax issues

781
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,070
and has been looking into the
president's returns for years.

782
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:58,800
- So, Charlie, in the
lawsuit, the committee claims

783
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,730
that the White House's refusal
to comply with their subpoena

784
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:03,207
is, and I'm quoting here,

785
00:30:03,207 --> 00:30:05,977
"An extraordinary attack on
the authority of Congress

786
00:30:05,977 --> 00:30:09,327
"to obtain information
needed to conduct oversight

787
00:30:09,327 --> 00:30:12,590
"of Treasury, the IRS, and the tax laws."

788
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,570
So, what are the questions
here for the judge,

789
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:17,273
who could obviously order
the defendants to comply?

790
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,063
- That's right.

791
00:30:19,063 --> 00:30:20,160
Well, the question here

792
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,010
is whether the broader Trump strategy

793
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:25,030
of stonewalling Congress,

794
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:27,210
which is to say that all of its requests

795
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:30,750
for oversight information
are illegitimate,

796
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:33,410
will withstand judicial scrutiny.

797
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:36,020
The Trump Administration has
been fighting all subpoenas

798
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,210
and requests for information

799
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,990
ever since the House was taken over

800
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:40,910
by Democrats six months ago

801
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:44,240
by saying that Congress only has authority

802
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,700
to request information

803
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,340
if it's thinking about
how to write a new law

804
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,930
and it doesn't have authority
to request information

805
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:52,920
to uncover wrongdoing,

806
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,290
and that even when it says
it's trying to write a new law,

807
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,300
like in this case,

808
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,200
the Executive Branch can second-guess that

809
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,557
and say, "That's just a pretext;

810
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:01,367
"this is really about exposing information

811
00:31:01,367 --> 00:31:02,707
"for political purposes.

812
00:31:02,707 --> 00:31:05,490
"That's outside your authority
and you can't do that."

813
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:08,670
Two courts have already
rejected that argument

814
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,736
at the District Court level

815
00:31:10,736 --> 00:31:13,190
for subpoenas by Congress
to financial firms

816
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,940
for Trump Organization records.

817
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,152
Now, a third judge will get a crack at it,

818
00:31:17,152 --> 00:31:20,410
and this is the first one
coming from Congress itself.

819
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:22,477
- So, here's part of the
White House statement.

820
00:31:22,477 --> 00:31:25,277
"Chairman Neal's willingness
to use his powerful committee

821
00:31:25,277 --> 00:31:27,247
"to go after his political opponents

822
00:31:27,247 --> 00:31:29,167
"is a danger to democracy.

823
00:31:29,167 --> 00:31:31,467
"The committee has no
legitimate legislative purpose

824
00:31:31,467 --> 00:31:33,947
"for which is can demand
the president's tax returns,

825
00:31:33,947 --> 00:31:35,157
"and it is evident

826
00:31:35,157 --> 00:31:38,770
"that they are only
interested in partisan games."

827
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:41,170
So, Charlie, is this partisan?

828
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:43,430
What could be in those returns

829
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:46,140
that would be of interest to Congress?

830
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,100
- Well, is it partisan?

831
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,720
I mean, you'd have to be utterly naive

832
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,170
to think this is not political.

833
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:51,003
Of course it's political.

834
00:31:51,003 --> 00:31:51,850
The question is just

835
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:54,960
whether it's within
Congress's authority to do it

836
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,030
regardless of its motive.

837
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:59,260
On the face of it, the law
says Congress, this committee,

838
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:02,490
can request any individual's
tax returns, period.

839
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:03,600
It doesn't set a limit.

840
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,800
And so the executive branch
is kind of inventing one,

841
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,340
and we'll see whether a
judge goes along with that.

842
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,280
But why would they want it?

843
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,660
They've said in other occasions

844
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,140
that they want to see these returns

845
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,240
because every president until
now has released his returns

846
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,930
and they wanna enforce that tradition.

847
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:22,360
They wanna see what kind of
financial dealings Trump has

848
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,860
that may have run afoul

849
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,820
of the Constitution's bar
on receiving emoluments

850
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,910
from foreign governments.

851
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:30,690
They wanna see what his business
entanglements with China

852
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,540
and with Russia and with other governments

853
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:37,110
that he might have foreign
policy decisions about are.

854
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:40,030
And they wanna see what the
president's financial health is

855
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:40,863
and whether it lines up

856
00:32:40,863 --> 00:32:42,840
with what he claims it is on the scale.

857
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,780
So, there's all kinds of reasons
that they want to see these

858
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:48,150
and they clearly also
wanna make them public.

859
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:50,350
- But, David, what they
wanna put out there

860
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,650
is that the reason

861
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:53,860
they don't think they
should turn them over

862
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,260
is kind of protecting the office,

863
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:59,500
not protecting something
that might be in there

864
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,100
that would lead to
problems for the president.

865
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,970
Tell us, in that context, what you know

866
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:08,650
about the president's returns
and what might be in there.

867
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,670
- Well, all of the arguments
that are being made

868
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:11,810
by the administration

869
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:15,880
are simply cover for
hiding Trump's tax returns.

870
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,300
And the argument that
the court's going to hear

871
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:22,390
is that Trump himself has made the case

872
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:24,440
that there is a legitimate
legislative purpose.

873
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,273
He has complained

874
00:33:25,273 --> 00:33:28,140
that he's being excessively
audited by the IRS.

875
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,170
He claimed recently he's being audited

876
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:32,140
because he's a Christian.

877
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:34,870
He claims that he's being treated

878
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:36,380
differently than other presidents.

879
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:39,970
So, he, with his own words,
has made the case here

880
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:41,810
that Congress should be looking at this

881
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:44,940
as part of its oversight of
the Internal Revenue Service.

882
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:49,550
And in the history of this
law, which was enacted in 1924,

883
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:51,200
there has not been until now

884
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,120
a single case that there's any record of

885
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:58,100
of the IRS not turning over
information when requested.

886
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,960
In fact, the Joint Committee on Taxation

887
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,860
has three staff members who
work in the IRS building

888
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,900
because they review tax
returns every day of the week.

889
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,910
- So, Mick Mulvaney, Trump's
acting chief of staff,

890
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:12,860
has said that the Democrats
will never see Trump's returns.

891
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:15,610
David, it sounds like you
wouldn't place a bet on that.

892
00:34:17,031 --> 00:34:18,530
- They will see Trump's tax returns.

893
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:21,060
Now, if this isn't settled
by the end of this Congress,

894
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,490
the clock will have to
restart with new litigation,

895
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:26,460
but we will eventually
see Trump's tax returns,

896
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,480
no question about it.

897
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,220
And in addition, the New
York State Legislature

898
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:32,300
and the governor have signed legislation

899
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,810
that provides to the
Ways and Means Committee

900
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:37,110
and other congressional
tax-writing committees

901
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:40,653
the New York State information
from Trump's tax returns.

902
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:44,270
People watching this shouldn't forget,

903
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:46,820
Trump won't even release the audit letter,

904
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,560
an absolutely anodyne document

905
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,420
that would say if he's under audit.

906
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,500
He claims he's audited ever year.

907
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,890
The only individuals who
get audited every year

908
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:57,410
are people the IRS has
strong reason to believe

909
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:58,520
are tax cheats,

910
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,880
but they haven't managed
to nail the case yet.

911
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,730
- So, to David's point
really quickly, Charlie,

912
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:04,763
when might we get us something on this?

913
00:35:04,763 --> 00:35:06,710
When might this all be settled?

914
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:09,010
Could it indeed go past 2020?

915
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:09,843
- Oh, easily.

916
00:35:09,843 --> 00:35:11,980
So, a district court
judge has to look at it.

917
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:15,380
Assuming Trump loses, he'll appeal.

918
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,060
An appeals court will have to look at it.

919
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,630
Then whoever loses that

920
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,190
will appeal to the full appeals court.

921
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,120
And then whoever loses that

922
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,800
will appeal to the Supreme Court.

923
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,090
It's very easy to see this
dragging on for a long time.

924
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:29,010
On the other hand, those two
cases I mentioned earlier

925
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:33,390
involving subpoenas to private
financial and banking firms

926
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:35,320
holding Trump Organization records,

927
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:39,050
the first-line judges who
looked at both of those cases

928
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:40,620
moved them very quickly.

929
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:43,370
In a matter of weeks they
said, "No, Trump is wrong,"

930
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:47,730
and ordered the firms to
comply, and then Trump appealed.

931
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:51,170
So, it's possible that judges
can choose to move this along

932
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:52,780
and not let it be dragged out.

933
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,950
But for now, it's clearly the strategy

934
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:58,350
of the Trump legal team to
just buy time and stall.

935
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:00,180
- Charlie Savage, David K. Johnston,

936
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,830
great to see both of you, thank you.

937
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:04,700
And up next, as tanks roll
into the nation's capital

938
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,250
ahead of tomorrow's festivities,

939
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:09,280
why some former military
officials are expressing concern

940
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,900
about President Trump's controversial

941
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,618
Fourth of July celebration.

942
00:36:12,618 --> 00:36:14,948
(upbeat news music)

943
00:36:14,948 --> 00:36:15,810
(alarm buzzing)

944
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,550
- [Announcer] This is your wake-up call.

945
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:20,520
If you have moderate to
severe rheumatoid arthritis

946
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,880
month after month, the clock is ticking

947
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,840
on irreversible joint damage.

948
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:28,630
Ongoing pain and stiffness
are signs of joint erosion.

949
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,760
Humira can help stop the clock.

950
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,230
Prescribed for 15 years,

951
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:34,820
Humira targets and blocks
a source of inflammation

952
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:38,690
that contributes to joint
pain and irreversible damage.

953
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:39,990
- [Announcer] Humira

is tweeting this morning.

1038
00:39:50,839 --> 00:39:53,757
He'll give the US, "The
show of a lifetime,"

1039
00:39:53,757 --> 00:39:57,155
at tomorrow's expanded July
4th celebrations in Washington.

1040
00:39:57,155 --> 00:39:59,796
Well, here's one look at
how that's coming along.

1041
00:39:59,796 --> 00:40:00,933
Politico's Heather Caygle

1042
00:40:00,933 --> 00:40:04,626
tweeted that a crane had
to be used to move a tank

1043
00:40:04,626 --> 00:40:06,639
after the flatbed truck transporting it

1044
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:09,140
was unable to clear an overpass.

1045
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,353
We have new images as well

1046
00:40:10,353 --> 00:40:12,126
of the tanks stationed around the Mall,

1047
00:40:12,126 --> 00:40:13,565
including the Lincoln Memorial,

1048
00:40:13,565 --> 00:40:15,856
where President Trump
will give his address.

1049
00:40:15,856 --> 00:40:19,118
There are also reports that
the cost of the extravaganza,

1050
00:40:19,118 --> 00:40:22,091
an event the president has
wanted for two years now,

1051
00:40:22,091 --> 00:40:25,038
will balloon far beyond
the usual $2 million

1052
00:40:25,038 --> 00:40:26,988
for a DC Fourth of July,

1053
00:40:26,988 --> 00:40:30,551
and the higher cost will mean
less money for national parks.

1054
00:40:30,551 --> 00:40:31,776
The Washington Post reports

1055
00:40:31,776 --> 00:40:35,622
the National Park Service has
diverted $2.5 million in fees

1056
00:40:35,622 --> 00:40:37,572
to cover some of the costs.

1057

NBC's Monica Alba joins us now

1058
00:40:39,362 --> 00:40:40,816
from the National Mall with more.

1059
00:40:40,816 --> 00:40:42,923
Hey, Monica, we're just a day away.

1060
00:40:42,923 --> 00:40:44,866
We know that the Pentagon
has been scrambling

1061
00:40:44,866 --> 00:40:47,056
to get together on short notice

1062
00:40:47,056 --> 00:40:48,502
what the White House is asking for.

1063
00:40:48,502 --> 00:40:51,335
What are you seeing on the ground?

1064
00:40:52,265 --> 00:40:53,302
- Exactly, Chris.

1065
00:40:53,302 --> 00:40:55,011
As you can see right here next to me,

1066
00:40:55,011 --> 00:40:58,393
these are actually two
Bradley Fighting Vehicles.

1067
00:40:58,393 --> 00:41:00,397
This is just some of the military might

1068
00:41:00,397 --> 00:41:03,325
that is expected to be on full display

1069
00:41:03,325 --> 00:41:05,136
tomorrow night here, of course,

1070
00:41:05,136 --> 00:41:07,327
on the National Mall right behind me.

1071
00:41:07,327 --> 00:41:08,935
And this is just some of an example.

1072
00:41:08,935 --> 00:41:09,880
You mentioned, of course,

1073
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:13,140
they were moved overnight on
trains and then flatbed trucks

1074
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:16,335
because these tanks are exactly so heavy.

1075
00:41:16,335 --> 00:41:17,629
And of course, this is the president,

1076
00:41:17,629 --> 00:41:20,334
he fell in love with this
two years ago in Paris

1077
00:41:20,334 --> 00:41:23,097
on Bastille Day and wanted to recreate it.

1078
00:41:23,097 --> 00:41:24,630
But a lot of critics are questioning

1079
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:26,926
whether he's gonna be able
to kind of keep this event

1080
00:41:26,926 --> 00:41:30,176
that is typically nonpartisan partisan,

1081
00:41:30,176 --> 00:41:32,810
whether he's going to go
into more of a campaign mode.

1082
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:34,789
Asked to kind of preview
what speech he's gonna give

1083
00:41:34,789 --> 00:41:37,034
and whether it's gonna be
able to unify all Americans,

1084
00:41:37,034 --> 00:41:38,364
he said, "I think so,"

1085
00:41:38,364 --> 00:41:40,586
but in the same answer
he also talked about

1086
00:41:40,586 --> 00:41:43,088
the healthcare plan that the
Democrats have put forward

1087
00:41:43,088 --> 00:41:44,179
destroying the country,

1088
00:41:44,179 --> 00:41:45,486
so that's a little bit of a fine line.

1089
00:41:45,486 --> 00:41:47,383
Now, everything here is still open.

1090
00:41:47,383 --> 00:41:49,318
You can see, of course,
this other Bradley Vehicle

1091
00:41:49,318 --> 00:41:50,456
and the Lincoln Memorial.

1092
00:41:50,456 --> 00:41:53,389
So, tourists are here, it's
just another hot summer day.

1093
00:41:53,389 --> 00:41:55,099
Tomorrow, this will look
a little different though,

1094
00:41:55,099 --> 00:41:57,600
with many people expected on the Mall.

1095
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,433
Chris?

1096
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:00,132
- Monica Alba, thank you for that.

1097
00:42:00,132 --> 00:42:02,718
Phil Rucker is back with me,
as well as highly-decorated

1098
00:42:02,718 --> 00:42:04,514
retired Army Colonel Jack Jacobs,

1099
00:42:04,514 --> 00:42:08,045
a Medal of Honor recipient and
MSNBC military contributor.

1100
00:42:08,045 --> 00:42:10,843
So, Phil, your paper reports,

1101
00:42:10,843 --> 00:42:13,174
"This year's gathering on
the Mall marks a departure

1102
00:42:13,174 --> 00:42:16,062
"because presidents have not
traditionally participated

1103
00:42:16,062 --> 00:42:18,824
"in the nation's Independence
Day celebration."

1104
00:42:18,824 --> 00:42:21,589
So, why Independence Day

1105
00:42:21,589 --> 00:42:24,059
if you're gonna do a military parade?

1106
00:42:24,059 --> 00:42:26,164
What are you hearing about
how this all came about,

1107
00:42:26,164 --> 00:42:28,024
'cause it was all pretty fast?

1108
00:42:28,024 --> 00:42:29,471
- Yeah, Chris, well the president

1109
00:42:29,471 --> 00:42:31,112
wanted to do a military parade

1110
00:42:31,112 --> 00:42:33,388
and those plans actually were thwarted,

1111
00:42:33,388 --> 00:42:37,203
in part by the DC government
over concerns about cost

1112
00:42:37,203 --> 00:42:40,306
and just infrastructure problems

1113
00:42:40,306 --> 00:42:43,290
with rolling tanks through
the streets of a city.

1114
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:45,896
And so, the parade was not to be.

1115
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:48,429
The president seized
on this July 4th moment

1116
00:42:48,429 --> 00:42:50,897
as a chance to put his own mark

1117
00:42:50,897 --> 00:42:52,637
on what has historically been

1118
00:42:52,637 --> 00:42:56,608
a decidedly nonpartisan celebration
in the nation's capital.

1119
00:42:56,608 --> 00:42:59,023
He's wanted to have bigger
fireworks than normal.

1120
00:42:59,023 --> 00:43:01,491
He's wanted to put
himself at center stage.

1121
00:43:01,491 --> 00:43:05,332
He's given out VIP tickets
to his political donors.

1122
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:07,818
And meanwhile, it's being
funded by the government,

1123
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:09,303
not by his campaign.

1124
00:43:09,303 --> 00:43:11,062
And, in fact, my colleagues at the Post

1125
00:43:11,062 --> 00:43:12,787
have reported last night

1126
00:43:12,787 --> 00:43:16,681
that $2.5 million in
national park entrance fees,

1127
00:43:16,681 --> 00:43:18,338
these are the fees that you pay

1128
00:43:18,338 --> 00:43:20,661
when you go to visit
Yosemite or Yellowstone

1129
00:43:20,661 --> 00:43:22,178
or any of these national parks,

1130
00:43:22,178 --> 00:43:24,797
that that money has been
diverted away from the parks

1131
00:43:24,797 --> 00:43:28,469
to help fund tomorrow's celebration.

1132
00:43:28,469 --> 00:43:30,039
- There are, Colonel Jack, as you know,

1133
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:31,760
military parades around the world,

1134
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,161
which, again, as Phil pointed out,

1135
00:43:33,161 --> 00:43:35,485
was originally what the president wanted.

1136
00:43:35,485 --> 00:43:37,814
Russia has Victory Day,
Iran, National Army Day,

1137
00:43:37,814 --> 00:43:40,043
we mentioned that he was at Bastille Day,

1138
00:43:40,043 --> 00:43:42,731
which is kind of where he got
the idea that he wanted this.

1139
00:43:42,731 --> 00:43:45,622
But do you share the
concerns that we've heard

1140
00:43:45,622 --> 00:43:47,326
from some former military officers

1141
00:43:47,326 --> 00:43:51,018
who say, "Look, you've got to
keep this stuff apolitical,"

1142
00:43:51,018 --> 00:43:53,139
and it clearly is not?

1143
00:43:53,139 --> 00:43:57,675
- Yeah, I do, and people
I talk to do as well.

1144
00:43:57,675 --> 00:43:59,215
We've had a long history and tradition

1145
00:43:59,215 --> 00:44:03,513
of having an apolitical
Fourth of July celebration.

1146
00:44:03,513 --> 00:44:06,222
We're celebrating the
founding of the country,

1147
00:44:06,222 --> 00:44:09,833
not celebrating our military might.

1148
00:44:09,833 --> 00:44:12,387
The thing that concerns me the most

1149
00:44:12,387 --> 00:44:17,387
is the fact that we don't have
to show our military might.

1150
00:44:17,876 --> 00:44:22,876
There are tank countries and
there are non-tank countries.

1151
00:44:22,962 --> 00:44:24,956
We are a non-tank country.

1152
00:44:24,956 --> 00:44:29,631
Iran is a tank country, North
Korea is, Russia, China.

1153
00:44:29,631 --> 00:44:31,822
Those are all tank countries.

1154
00:44:31,822 --> 00:44:33,216
We don't have to demonstrate.

1155
00:44:33,216 --> 00:44:35,268
Matter of fact, it's part of our strength

1156
00:44:35,268 --> 00:44:39,153
that we don't have to demonstrate
our strength in this way.

1157
00:44:39,153 --> 00:44:40,702
And the conclusion that one draws

1158
00:44:40,702 --> 00:44:43,518
is that this is merely a,

1159
00:44:43,518 --> 00:44:47,449
it's not even a
thinly-veiled campaign event.

1160
00:44:47,449 --> 00:44:50,243
It looks exactly like a campaign event.

1161
00:44:50,243 --> 00:44:53,076
And it panders to the least savory

1162
00:44:54,871 --> 00:44:57,573
of all of our political notions, Chris.

1163
00:44:57,573 --> 00:44:59,285
- Well, the other thing, I think,

1164
00:44:59,285 --> 00:45:00,924
that we're seeing here a little bit, Phil,

1165
00:45:00,924 --> 00:45:02,907
is that this is, in some ways,

1166
00:45:02,907 --> 00:45:04,391
not unlike the president tweeting

1167
00:45:04,391 --> 00:45:06,791
he'd like to meet Kim Jong-un at the DMZ

1168
00:45:06,791 --> 00:45:08,495
and then there's this big scramble, right?

1169
00:45:08,495 --> 00:45:11,291
The new press secretary gets
caught in the middle of it

1170
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:13,913
and all these things have to
be done at the last minute.

1171
00:45:13,913 --> 00:45:15,136
Sounds like that's the same thing

1172
00:45:15,136 --> 00:45:18,165
that happened to the
Pentagon in this case.

1173
00:45:18,165 --> 00:45:20,303
- Yeah, Chris, part of what's
going on here, I think,

1174
00:45:20,303 --> 00:45:22,128
is that the president himself

1175
00:45:22,128 --> 00:45:23,756
is trying to produce this event.

1176
00:45:23,756 --> 00:45:26,099
Remember, his background is in putting on

1177
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:27,648
reality television shows.

1178
00:45:27,648 --> 00:45:28,947
He cares intensely

1179
00:45:28,947 --> 00:45:31,999
about the staging of
his political rallies,

1180
00:45:31,999 --> 00:45:33,553
about what goes where,

1181
00:45:33,553 --> 00:45:35,140
about what equipment would be involved.

1182
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:37,797
And he's been very hands-on
in the last few weeks

1183
00:45:37,797 --> 00:45:40,893
in putting together the
plans for the Fourth of July

1184
00:45:40,893 --> 00:45:42,198
on the Mall.
- Wait just a second.

1185
00:45:42,198 --> 00:45:43,646
Colonel Jack, does it bother you,

1186
00:45:43,646 --> 00:45:45,921
with everything that is
going on in the world,

1187
00:45:45,921 --> 00:45:48,700
multiple nuclear threats among them,

1188
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:51,997
that this is how the president
is spending his time?

1189
00:45:51,997 --> 00:45:54,706
- Well, of course it's bothersome.

1190
00:45:54,706 --> 00:45:55,843
Look, he's not alone.

1191
00:45:55,843 --> 00:45:59,778
All presidents are always
campaigning, always have been.

1192
00:45:59,778 --> 00:46:02,132
But this is really in-your-face

1193
00:46:02,132 --> 00:46:04,563
and it's clear that his focus

1194
00:46:04,563 --> 00:46:08,409
is less on the kinds of
things that keep us free

1195
00:46:08,409 --> 00:46:11,537
than things that look
like they keep us free.

1196
00:46:11,537 --> 00:46:13,216
The decision-making,

1197
00:46:13,216 --> 00:46:14,602
you just have to go back a couple of weeks

1198
00:46:14,602 --> 00:46:18,100
and take a look at the
paucity of intelligent

1199
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,881
and strategic decision-making

1200
00:46:19,881 --> 00:46:22,984
that has taken place just
in the last few weeks,

1201
00:46:22,984 --> 00:46:26,234
with Iran being aggressive in the Gulf,

1202
00:46:27,349 --> 00:46:30,764
the attacks on the ships there,

1203
00:46:30,764 --> 00:46:34,130
what's taken place in Iran now,

1204
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:36,686
plussing up its nuclear capability.

1205
00:46:36,686 --> 00:46:39,409
No response from the
United States to speak of.

1206
00:46:39,409 --> 00:46:41,576
Same thing in North Korea.

1207
00:46:42,947 --> 00:46:45,431
China is spreading out
across the South China Sea,

1208
00:46:45,431 --> 00:46:46,264
and so on.

1209
00:46:47,358 --> 00:46:48,775
There are lots and lots of things

1210
00:46:48,775 --> 00:46:51,863
we need to do with our
military; this isn't one of 'em.

1211
00:46:51,863 --> 00:46:53,626
- Colonel Jack Jacobs,
always good to see you.

1212
00:46:53,626 --> 00:46:54,459
Happy Fourth.

1213
00:46:54,459 --> 00:46:55,780
And to you, Phil Rucker, as well.

1214
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:57,420
Thanks, guys.
- Thank you.

1215
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:59,193
- Up next, it might not come as a surprise

1216
00:46:59,193 --> 00:47:00,625
that polls show Elizabeth Warren

1217
00:47:00,625 --> 00:47:02,143
and Kamala Harris getting a bump

1218
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:05,579
after their debate
performances, but a new analysis

1219
00:47:05,579 --> 00:47:09,096
shows exactly where their
gains are coming from.

1220
00:47:09,096 --> 00:47:11,619
(upbeat news music)

1221
00:47:11,619 --> 00:47:12,634
(light upbeat piano music)

1222
00:47:12,634 --> 00:47:15,988
- [Announcer] Let's get down to business.

1223
00:47:15,988 --> 00:47:18,321
The business of family time.

1224
00:47:19,302 --> 00:47:20,469
And down time.

1225
00:47:21,904 --> 00:47:22,987
And you time.

1226
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:28,683
And forgetting what time it is altogether.

1227
00:47:29,612 --> 00:47:32,600

- [Woman] Thanks, Golden Corral.

1233
00:47:42,654 --> 00:47:44,760
Dan gets a slow-smoked sirloin

1234
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,835
and my little trio are as happy as shrimp.

1235
00:47:46,835 --> 00:47:48,042
Oops, clams.

1236
00:47:48,042 --> 00:47:50,991
And Mom got it all,
hook, line, and sirloin.

1237
00:47:50,991 --> 00:47:52,957
- [Announcer] The slow-smoked
sirloin and shrimp trio.

1238
00:47:52,957 --> 00:47:54,290
Golden Corral, the only one--

00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:56,207
- [Crowd] For everyone.

No matter what you trade,

00:48:06,975 --> 00:48:11,855
at Fidelity, it's just $4.95
per online US equity trade.

1244
00:48:11,855 --> 00:48:14,738
- [Announcer] Pain, swelling, stiffness.

1245
00:48:14,738 --> 00:48:17,604
When your hands hurt, you can't function.

1246
00:48:17,604 --> 00:48:19,029
Until now.

1247
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:22,558
Introducing the new Copper
Fit Compression Gloves

1248
00:48:22,558 --> 00:48:25,594
with Sure Grip technology
to give you more power,

1249
00:48:25,594 --> 00:48:28,456
more control, and more agility than ever.

1250
00:48:28,456 --> 00:48:31,368
Our most advanced copper-infused
compression fabric

1251
00:48:31,368 --> 00:48:34,216
woven into an ultra
lightweight performance glove

1252
00:48:34,216 --> 00:48:36,490
that fits like a second skin

1253
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:39,320
to support relief and
recovery of sore muscles

1254
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,254
and painful joint stiffness.

1255
00:48:41,254 --> 00:48:43,617
And new Sure Grip bands built in

1256
00:48:43,617 --> 00:48:45,901
to provide a strong, non-slip grip

1257
00:48:45,901 --> 00:48:47,639
for more power and control.

1258
00:48:47,639 --> 00:48:49,365
- You need total control of your hands

1259
00:48:49,365 --> 00:48:51,285
when you're doing anything
with construction.

1260
00:48:51,285 --> 00:48:52,780
Your hands are your livelihood.

1261
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:54,490
The Copper Fit gloves are great.

1262
00:48:54,490 --> 00:48:57,007
The grip is outstanding here
with these different ribs.

1263
00:48:57,007 --> 00:48:58,943
It makes my hand a lot more usable.

1264
00:48:58,943 --> 00:49:01,254
It just feels like you're
ready to start the job.

1265
00:49:01,254 --> 00:49:02,959
- The gloves have been
a game-changer for me.

1266
00:49:02,959 --> 00:49:06,276
They help with flexibility
and pain and soreness.

1275

to do the smallest thing.

1278
00:49:28,429 --> 00:49:30,970

I do not have any pain.

keyboard, I can use my phone,

00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:42,763
- [Announcer] It's got to be Tide.

1314
00:50:42,763 --> 00:50:44,628
- Knowledge is power.

1315
00:50:44,628 --> 00:50:46,183

1316

to decide how this country
should be governed.

1317
00:50:51,719 --> 00:50:53,738
- [Announcer] More
Americans watch NBC News

1318
00:50:53,738 --> 00:50:57,571
than any other news
organization in the world.

1319
00:51:00,536 --> 00:51:02,726
- This morning, a new
Washington Post/ABC poll

1320
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:05,042
shows that while Kamala
Harris and Elizabeth Warren

1321
00:51:05,042 --> 00:51:08,175
both did get a boost from
strong debate performances,

1322
00:51:08,175 --> 00:51:10,317
Joe Biden still leads.

1323
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:13,384
And that lead has diminished,
though he remains at the top

1324
00:51:13,384 --> 00:51:16,527
of every single national poll
we've seen since the debates.

1325
00:51:16,527 --> 00:51:19,068
And this morning, we may know why.

1326
00:51:19,068 --> 00:51:21,878
It goes beyond Iowa and
beyond the nomination.

1327
00:51:21,878 --> 00:51:25,122
45% of voters think
that he is the candidate

1328
00:51:25,122 --> 00:51:27,868
who can beat Trump in
the general election.

1329
00:51:27,868 --> 00:51:30,294
Joining me to weigh in, Liz Alarcon,

1330
00:51:30,294 --> 00:51:32,708
founder of Pulso, a
social media organization

1331
00:51:32,708 --> 00:51:35,590
dedicated to top issues
affecting Latino-Americans.

1332
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:37,727
Rick Tyler and Doug
Thornell are back with me.

1333
00:51:37,727 --> 00:51:39,351
Doug, do you think it's that simple?

1334
00:51:39,351 --> 00:51:40,573
Biden is still in the lead

1335
00:51:40,573 --> 00:51:42,572
because he's viewed as more moderate

1336
00:51:42,572 --> 00:51:45,559
and Democrats think he
can win in the general?

1337
00:51:45,559 --> 00:51:46,680
- Well, I think it's also because

1338
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,672
he's got a broad coalition of support.

1339
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:51,856
African-Americans have
been a base of his support

1340
00:51:51,856 --> 00:51:52,891
since he started.

1341
00:51:52,891 --> 00:51:55,131
He's doing well with older voters.

1342
00:51:55,131 --> 00:51:57,908
He's doing well with moderate voters.

1343
00:51:57,908 --> 00:51:59,551
So, he's got a broader coalition.

1344
00:51:59,551 --> 00:52:01,647
I think, depending upon
what polls you look at,

1345
00:52:01,647 --> 00:52:02,752
they're saying different things,

1346
00:52:02,752 --> 00:52:05,702
so I would just be cautious
about interpreting them too much

1347
00:52:05,702 --> 00:52:09,271
until maybe a couple weeks
after the debates have passed.

1348
00:52:09,271 --> 00:52:10,104
But clearly--

1349
00:52:10,104 --> 00:52:11,290
- Well, let me show you something though,

1350
00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:12,295
'cause this is interesting,

1351
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:15,436
because FiveThirtyEight
did something really smart.

1352
00:52:15,436 --> 00:52:17,140
They took a group of voters

1353
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:19,585
before the debates and polled them,

1354
00:52:19,585 --> 00:52:22,473
and then they did one after the debate.

1355
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:25,755
So, you actually see how the
debates really moved things.

1356
00:52:25,755 --> 00:52:26,588
Look at this.

1357
00:52:26,588 --> 00:52:30,397
The big winner, clearly,
Kamala Harris, up 9.4%.

1358
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:33,657
Julian Castro, Elizabeth
Warren also gaining.

1359
00:52:33,657 --> 00:52:36,800
But look at Joe Biden, down 6.8%,

1360
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:41,044
Beto O'Rourke, Pete Buttigieg
also losing ground there.

1361
00:52:41,044 --> 00:52:43,544
What do you make of that, Liz?

1362
00:52:44,819 --> 00:52:46,909
- I would say that there are several polls

1363
00:52:46,909 --> 00:52:48,123
that we should be looking at.

1364
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:50,088
The Univision poll that came out yesterday

1365
00:52:50,088 --> 00:52:54,145
that surveyed Latinx voters
showed that Kamala Harris

1366
00:52:54,145 --> 00:52:56,614
went up from sixth place up to first

1367
00:52:56,614 --> 00:52:58,974
and Julian Castro also had a big jump.

1368
00:52:58,974 --> 00:53:00,022
He's now in second place

1369
00:53:00,022 --> 00:53:02,353
among those Latinx voters
that were surveyed.

1370
00:53:02,353 --> 00:53:03,956
And we know that the Latinx community

1371
00:53:03,956 --> 00:53:07,836
is going to be the largest
minority voting bloc in 2020.

1372
00:53:07,836 --> 00:53:08,877
- [Chris] How do we know that?

1373
00:53:08,877 --> 00:53:10,934
How do we know that?

1374
00:53:10,934 --> 00:53:12,676
- Well, many studies from Pew have shown

1375
00:53:12,676 --> 00:53:15,503
that our community is increasing,

1376
00:53:15,503 --> 00:53:18,871
not only in voting age
but in numbers overall.

1377
00:53:18,871 --> 00:53:21,628
So, the number of folks
in the Latinx community

1378
00:53:21,628 --> 00:53:23,353
that are turning 18 is, I think,

1379
00:53:23,353 --> 00:53:25,800
around 800,000 every single day,

1380
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,888
and so we know that the
candidate that is elected

1381
00:53:28,888 --> 00:53:32,549
in 2020 in the Democratic primaries

1382
00:53:32,549 --> 00:53:35,654
will not win the general
election without the Latinx vote.

1383
00:53:35,654 --> 00:53:39,987
- So, there is a lotta talk
about who won, who lost.

1384
00:53:41,878 --> 00:53:44,192
And, Rick, I think, obviously,

1385
00:53:44,192 --> 00:53:46,036
these polls aren't just
being watched closely

1386
00:53:46,036 --> 00:53:47,002
by these campaigns,

1387
00:53:47,002 --> 00:53:50,241
they're also being watched
by the Trump campaign.

1388
00:53:50,241 --> 00:53:54,708
What do they take away from
what we've seen so far?

1389
00:53:54,708 --> 00:53:56,435
- Well, I think the
imprimatur of invincibility

1390
00:53:56,435 --> 00:53:58,456
on Joe Biden has been removed.

1391
00:53:58,456 --> 00:54:00,601
And I think Kamala Harris is right,

1392
00:54:00,601 --> 00:54:02,599
Kamala, I'm gonna learn
how to pronounce that name,

1393
00:54:02,599 --> 00:54:05,192
Harris is right where she wants to be,

1394
00:54:05,192 --> 00:54:07,988
because you do not wanna be
the frontrunner this early out.

1395
00:54:07,988 --> 00:54:10,405
Being in second place is
a terrific place to be.

1396
00:54:10,405 --> 00:54:12,595
- [Chris] Would Trump rather
run against her than Biden

1397
00:54:12,595 --> 00:54:13,546
or vice versa,

1398
00:54:13,546 --> 00:54:14,898
or any of the other
candidates, for that matter?

1399
00:54:14,898 --> 00:54:18,104
- I don't know, I think
it's too early to say.

1400
00:54:18,104 --> 00:54:19,706
I don't think anything's set in stone.

1401
00:54:19,706 --> 00:54:23,285
I think the leaders are
gonna shift a little bit

1402
00:54:23,285 --> 00:54:25,011
and there's gonna be a
lotta people that drop off.

1403
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:27,790
But what's significant is
Joe Biden just lost ground

1404
00:54:27,790 --> 00:54:29,238
in every single demographic,

1405
00:54:29,238 --> 00:54:31,468
among all the ideological spectrum,

1406
00:54:31,468 --> 00:54:35,244
and Kamala Harris gained
in every single one,

1407
00:54:35,244 --> 00:54:37,354
particularly black voters,

1408
00:54:37,354 --> 00:54:40,128
which probably came out of Joe Biden.

1409
00:54:40,128 --> 00:54:44,412
But Elizabeth Warren was
kinda flat, actually.

1410
00:54:44,412 --> 00:54:47,497
She has lost significant
support among black voters.

1411
00:54:47,497 --> 00:54:50,190
But Joe Biden still
remains the top of the heap

1412
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:52,847
and the person that people
believe will beat Donald Trump.

1413
00:54:52,847 --> 00:54:56,073
But Kamala Harris has
improved significantly

1414
00:54:56,073 --> 00:54:58,172
her believability that
she can beat Donald Trump,

1415
00:54:58,172 --> 00:55:00,061
and that's a huge factor

1416
00:55:00,061 --> 00:55:01,792
with Democratic voters this time around.

1417
00:55:01,792 --> 00:55:03,586
- Yeah, I mean, obviously, Doug,

1418
00:55:03,586 --> 00:55:05,581
you gotta build a winning coalition.

1419
00:55:05,581 --> 00:55:08,622
There's a new piece by NBC
News reporter Alex Seitz-Wald,

1420
00:55:08,622 --> 00:55:11,613
who writes, "Harris stunned Biden.

1421
00:55:11,613 --> 00:55:15,363
"But can she meld a
winning Obama coalition?"

1422
00:55:18,495 --> 00:55:20,082
How do you build that?

1423
00:55:20,082 --> 00:55:23,155
And who, from your
perspective at this point,

1424
00:55:23,155 --> 00:55:26,104
is doing the right things
to move in that direction?

1425
00:55:26,104 --> 00:55:27,126
- Well, you start building it

1426
00:55:27,126 --> 00:55:28,868
by putting organizers on the ground,

1427
00:55:28,868 --> 00:55:30,796
and I think Kamala Harris's campaign

1428
00:55:30,796 --> 00:55:32,312
is doing that more and more,

1429
00:55:32,312 --> 00:55:33,815
both in Iowa and South Carolina.

1430
00:55:33,815 --> 00:55:36,663
Elizabeth Warren has a huge field staff

1431
00:55:36,663 --> 00:55:40,857
that she's invested in in a
number of key early states.

1432
00:55:40,857 --> 00:55:44,031
And so, having that direct
person-to-person communication

1433
00:55:44,031 --> 00:55:47,824
is really important in terms
of building out your coalition.

1434
00:55:47,824 --> 00:55:50,202
Moments like the debate
are really important.

1435
00:55:50,202 --> 00:55:52,686
When these candidates start to advertise

1436
00:55:52,686 --> 00:55:55,882
and get their message out across
mass communication mediums,

1437
00:55:55,882 --> 00:55:57,641
that's gonna be really important.

1438
00:55:57,641 --> 00:56:00,828
But, look, I would take issue
with one thing that Rick said.

1439
00:56:00,828 --> 00:56:03,995
Look, I think that with Kamala Harris,

1440
00:56:05,171 --> 00:56:06,736
there is a lotta room to grow.

1441
00:56:06,736 --> 00:56:08,912
And a lotta people didn't
know her or Elizabeth Warren,

1442
00:56:08,912 --> 00:56:10,343
so they took advantage of that

1443
00:56:10,343 --> 00:56:11,518
and both of them did really well.

1444
00:56:11,518 --> 00:56:13,982
Elizabeth Warren did very
well, I think, as well.

1445
00:56:13,982 --> 00:56:15,365
- Seize the day, right?

1446
00:56:15,365 --> 00:56:17,622
Liz, Rick, Doug, thanks to all of you.
