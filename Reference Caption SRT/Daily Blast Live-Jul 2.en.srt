1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,080
- You are totally off base here.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,600
- [Announcer] Log on and
join our live conversation.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,370
- I can't believe I'm saying
this, I do agree with you.

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,493
- [Announcer] DBL starts right now.

5
00:00:12,576 --> 00:00:14,380
- [Producer] Three, two.

6
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,100
- Welcome to Daily Blast Live.

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,440
It is Tuesday, May 7th, we are live

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,310
and we're talking about what
you're talking about right now.

9
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,760
I'm here with Tory, Jeff, Al and I am Sam.

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,970
Let's get started.

11
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,870
We have our brand new interview

12
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:28,670
with pop sensation's Pentatonix,

13
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,740
joining us from their
first ever world tour.

14
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,010
Plus we have wedding
guest fashion secrets.

15
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,610
We're telling you how
you can look your best,

16
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,310
without, of course, upstaging
the bride, c'mon on now.

17
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:43,650
All that in minutes, the
stars brought their craziest,

18
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,480
most over-the-top looks ever

19
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,770
to this year's Met Gala.

20
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,930
The theme was camp, notes of fashion,

21
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,440
and everyone was expected
to pull out all the stops,

22
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,060
but hold up, what is camp?

23
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,610
Well, it is defined as the
love of the un-natural,

24
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,620
of artifice and exaggeration,
basically everything

25
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,700
that is fabulous, ironic, or extra.

26
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,440
So let's get to the fashion,
and the title this year

27
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,210
for the most lit, definitely
goes to Katy Perry,

28
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,680
whether ya hate it, or ya like it,

29
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,320
she definitely is having people talking.

30
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,340
She wore this illuminated chandelier look,

31
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,660
it was created for her by
Jeremy Scott of Moschino.

32
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,410
Kim Kardashian showed off her figure,

33
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,570
in this skin tight latex corseted dress,

34
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:21,417
- [Jeff] Looks like a bottle of perfume.

35
00:01:21,417 --> 00:01:24,210
- [Sam] by Thierry Mugler,
who came out of retirement

36
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,350
to create the look, which took, you guys,

37
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:27,990
eight months to complete, by the way.

38
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,100
It appeared to be dripping
wet, thanks in part

39
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,560
to the crystals and shimmery material.

40
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,960
Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx
made their public debut

41
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,360
as a couple last night.

42
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,480
While they didn't hit
the pink carpet together,

43
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,710
the couple did pose for photos
with one another inside,

44
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,900
and Kendall and Kylie Jenner
broke out the feathers

45
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,960
for their camp looks.

46
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,370
Kendall wore bright orange
feathered Versace gown,

47
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,590
while Kylie opted for a
lilac look, with a fur stohl

48
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,830
I'm hoping faux, and a matching wig.

49
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:55,760
Actress Janelle Monae
embraced wearable art,

50
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,160
with this custom Christian Siriano look,

51
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,820
and the eye even winked as she
walked down the pink carpet.

52
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,920
Come on now.

53
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,330
Lady Gaga served up multiple
looks for her grand entrance

54
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,780
to the event, all created
by Brandon Maxwell.

55
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,930
It started off with a huge pink dress,

56
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:14,310
that took an army of men
with umbrellas to wrangle,

57
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,530
she then stripped down to a black dress,

58
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,480
followed by a skin tight pink dress,

59
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,430
and then it all ended up with her posing

60
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,150
in her underwear, here it comes.

61
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,110
Yes girl, with huge platform shoes.

62
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,630
Serena Williams wore
this stunning neon yellow

63
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,930
Versace gown, with pink
feathery leaf accents,

64
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,570
and she paired her look with neon Nikes.

65
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:37,790
Jennifer Lopez sparkled in
this beaded Versace dress,

66
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,680
with a plunging neckline
and fringe detailing.

67
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,110
She wore a matching headpiece,
and of course A-rod,

68
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,410
I mean, Tory, makes a good
accessory, am I right?

69
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,280
- [Tory] Mmm bah!
- [Sam] Okay

70
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,360
Lupita Nyong'o embraced the
rainbow, with this Versace gown,

71
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,410
with pink star pattern
and rainbow ruffles,

72
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:57,400
and check out the gold
afro picks in her hair,

73
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,490
with raised fist logos, yes.

74
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,740
Jared Leto, my favorite,

75
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,030
had the best accessory of the night.

76
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,850
A custom replica of his head.

77
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:08,030
He brought it along while
rocking this red Gucci dress.

78
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,520
Kacey Musgraves looked like a barbie doll,

79
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,470
in this hot pink Moschino leather dress,

80
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:16,440
pairing it with a blow dryer
bag and cat eye shades.

81
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,280
Cardi B won the award
for the biggest train,

82
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,610
with this red feathered, Tom Brown gown.

83
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:25,620
The 10 foot long train, nearly
took over the pink carpet,

84
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,563
and Cierra might have won
best hair of the night,

85
00:03:27,563 --> 00:03:29,280
I think she won, let's be honest,

86
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,190
with this very extra, gorgeous afro.

87
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:35,220
She also wore a custom Peter
Dundas emerald green crown,

88
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,143
because she is a queen,

89
00:03:37,143 --> 00:03:39,580
and Zendaya had a fairy
tale moment at the gala,

90
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,730
transforming into Cinderella,
in this Tommy Hilfiger

91
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,070
ball gown, with white poofy sleeves,

92
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,430
and a skirt that lit up,

93
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,360
yes, yes, yes.

94
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,335
- Sam, you drink some water, we'll talk.

95
00:03:51,335 --> 00:03:52,700
(laughter)
- Are you, I actually

96
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,830
looked at Al, or Al, I
looked at Jeff midway,

97
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:56,940
and your eyes were closed.

98
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,475
- Dude, I was out.
(laughter)

99
00:03:58,475 --> 00:04:01,010
I was thinking about cheese and crackers,

100
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,100
and what I'm gonna do tonight.

101
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:02,933
- You know what I was thinking?

102
00:04:02,933 --> 00:04:04,766
I'm like this coffee's
bitter, I should think about

103
00:04:04,766 --> 00:04:06,350
a different kind of coffee. (laughs)

104
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,634
- I guess I'm the only one,

105
00:04:07,634 --> 00:04:10,260
- I was kinda into it Sam.
- really appreciated the

106
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,803
looks as art.

107
00:04:11,803 --> 00:04:12,636
Say what you want.
- It took, all those people

108
00:04:12,636 --> 00:04:14,050
got together to entertain us,

109
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:15,183
- I agree.
- like that's all,

110
00:04:15,183 --> 00:04:16,800
I mean it's just like
somebody's gotta shake it up

111
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,260
a little bit, we all can't
wear khakis and polo shirts,

112
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,280
somebody's gotta shake it
up and push the envelope

113
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,875
a little bit, that's what art does.

114
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,370
- I'm for universal uniforms everyday.

115
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,773
- Like Star Trek?
- Yes!

116
00:04:25,773 --> 00:04:27,280
- Boring!
- Boring, I wear

117
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,940
the same thing to work
everyday, that's fine with me.

118
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,440
- Yeah, that's a man of a certain age,

119
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,220
I'd do the same thing, I
got those green sweat pants,

120
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,721
they could walk to work themselves.

121
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:35,554
(laughter)

122
00:04:35,554 --> 00:04:36,387
- I've noticed that too.

123
00:04:36,387 --> 00:04:38,330
- Now, Tory, do you have a favorite,

124
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,270
even though I guess you were bored by it?

125
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,940
- No, no, I did have a favorite,

126
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,540
Ezra Miller, I though
absolutely nailed camp.

127
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,970
And this is a guy that is gender fluid,

128
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:49,010
and he used prosthetics as the eyes,

129
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:50,750
- Wow!
- And you really get that kid,

130
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,088
- Wait, wait, wait,
those weren't real eyes?

131
00:04:52,088 --> 00:04:53,476
- I know, I don't know
what I said it like that.

132
00:04:53,476 --> 00:04:54,309
(laughter)

133
00:04:54,309 --> 00:04:55,400
Those were real eyes.

134
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,530
But it's about the artifice
and the exaggeration,

135
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,730
and I like the gender
fluidity, that was all over

136
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:00,563
the red carpet,
- [Sam] It was.

137
00:05:00,563 --> 00:05:02,680
- the pink carpet, excuse me.
- Yeah, I loved that too,

138
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,513
I'm with you, Al?

139
00:05:03,513 --> 00:05:04,356
- I'mma nod my head and pretend like

140
00:05:04,356 --> 00:05:05,388
I know what artifice means.

141
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,380
- [Sam] (laughs)
- The artificialness,

142
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,180
like it's fake, like camp is very kitschy

143
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,560
and fake and over done.

144
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,777
- [Sam] Right, now.

145
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,188
- Now, what does kitschy mean?

146
00:05:12,188 --> 00:05:13,577
- [Sam] Same thing.
- Campy, yeah.

147
00:05:13,577 --> 00:05:14,410
- [Al] Okay, thank you.

148
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,300
- Now Al, we do call
you Al Fashion Jackson,

149
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,133
- Yes ma'am.
- so you had

150
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:17,966
to have a favorite.

151
00:05:17,966 --> 00:05:19,653
- Oh, my boy Nick Jonas.

152
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:20,570
I mean that is like
- [Sam] Your boy, huh?

153
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,670
- Yeah, we go way back, but
I just like, he looks like,

154
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:23,720
- He looks like little finger.

155
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,553
- He looks like a waiter at

156
00:05:24,553 --> 00:05:25,690
The Cheesecake Factory, doesn't he?

157
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,232
- [Tory] Yeah. (laughs)
- [Jeff] Like Dubai.

158
00:05:27,232 --> 00:05:28,616
- [Al] Yeah, like,
- [Sam] In Dubai.

159
00:05:28,616 --> 00:05:29,827
- [Al] makes me hungry.
- [Tory] A lot of people, yes.

160
00:05:29,827 --> 00:05:30,680
- The Dubai Cheesecake Factory.

161
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,191
- That's it, that's it,
- That's a good one.

162
00:05:32,191 --> 00:05:33,024
- that's their uniforms.
- You nailed it,

163
00:05:33,024 --> 00:05:34,990
you nailed it, Jeff,
do you have a favorite?

164
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,880
- Well, listen, I know everyone
hates Kylie and Kendall,

165
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,640
the Kardashians, or Jenners I should say,

166
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,147
check them out, they look
terrific, but I don't like

167
00:05:40,147 --> 00:05:41,860
that they didn't walk with their dates

168
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,663
down the red or the pink carpet.

169
00:05:43,663 --> 00:05:45,391
(laughter)

170
00:05:45,391 --> 00:05:46,850
- That's a good one, that's a good one.

171
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:50,080
Hey, I'm gonna, listen,
I think all the work

172
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,500
that these fashion designers
put into these outfits,

173
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,320
I really wanna give
them some credit, I know

174
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,153
- [Al] Sam, who was your favorite?

175
00:05:55,153 --> 00:05:57,680
- [Sam] Janelle Monae,
that is a work of art.

176
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,960
That dress is art, you
guys, and then again,

177
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,920
with the gender fluidity,
I think that Jared Leto

178
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,880
with that gorgeous red Gucci gown,

179
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,210
and then who doesn't love
a severed head as a purse.

180
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,940
- I really didn't even
notice he was wearing a gown,

181
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,430
and I think that's the way,
if you don't want people

182
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,610
to notice, just carry another head.

183
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,400
I really did not notice
he was wearing a gown,

184
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,233
till you said something.

185
00:06:17,233 --> 00:06:18,180
- [Jeff] Wait, that's a purse?

186
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,360
- I believe it was a purse.
- I think it was,

187
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,210
or an accessory, but he
held it like a purse.

188
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:22,043
- [Sam] He held it like a purse.

189
00:06:22,043 --> 00:06:22,876
- [Tory] He sure did.

190
00:06:22,876 --> 00:06:24,070
- [Sam] I, hey, I'm all for it.

191
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,876
- [Al] So we don't know.
- [Tory] Lookin' good Jared.

192
00:06:25,876 --> 00:06:26,860
(laughter)
I don't know.

193
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,693
- [Al] Now what if Mark

194
00:06:27,693 --> 00:06:30,030
showed up with that purse of your head?

195
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,002
- [Jeff] Fashion.

196
00:06:31,002 --> 00:06:31,881
(laughter)

197
00:06:31,881 --> 00:06:33,860
- [Sam] Yeah, exactly, fashion.

198
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,090
All right, let's get this
next story, an update

199
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,330
to the college admission scandal.

200
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,120
Lori Loughlin's defense might
have just gotten a boost,

201
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,140
thanks to the University of
Southern California's crew team.

202
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,080
Teams that reports this ad for the team

203
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,750
is posted all over campus.

204
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,310
You can see it says no
experience, no problem.

205
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:52,210
Some say the poster could
help Lori's defense,

206
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:55,120
that her daughters lack of
experience doesn't matter,

207
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,350
the team doesn't require
experience to join.

208
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,340
Lori of course, is
accused of paying bribes

209
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,830
to pass her daughters
off as athletic recruits,

210
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,890
in order to get them into USC.

211
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:07,850
Now Tory, I know you are our legal eagle,

212
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,076
this makes my blood boil.

213
00:07:09,076 --> 00:07:09,909
- [Tory] Yeah.

214
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:12,090
- Because if Lori Loughlin
is going to use this

215
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,140
as her defense, she's
suggesting that all of us

216
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,020
are stupid.
- [Tory] Yep.

217
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,600
- She's suggesting that
everybody out there

218
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,810
that has worked hard to
get into a university,

219
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:21,820
whether you are an athlete,
whether you are as a scholar,

220
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,890
again is stupid, so
could this work for her?

221
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,150
- Yeah, it could go both ways, right?

222
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,560
It could backfire completely,
because it's so obvious.

223
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,507
We have her on tape, being
like, "Take a picture

224
00:07:30,507 --> 00:07:32,698
"of them on rowing
machines, and send it in."

225
00:07:32,698 --> 00:07:34,610
We know the real thing.

226
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,860
She insulted so many people
when she plead not guilty.

227
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,480
That's really where she made her mistake

228
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,010
as we talked before.

229
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,157
Now it only takes one person, to be like,

230
00:07:42,157 --> 00:07:43,650
"Maybe she didn't know though."

231
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,810
So they are using the loophole defense,

232
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,900
it's a long shot, it's a Hail Mary,

233
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,880
but it's worked before,
and all she wants to do

234
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,600
is avoid prison time.

235
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,830
- [Jeff] And I think she is gonna do that.

236
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,120
- [Tory] You do?
- And I don't think so.

237
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,317
- I think she's gonna, listen.

238
00:07:55,317 --> 00:07:58,680
She's not calling us
stupid, our judicial system

239
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,070
is calling us stupid, the
lawyers that defend her

240
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,770
are calling us stupid,
because if she gets off,

241
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:06,389
it's just proof that our
system does not work.

242
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:07,222
- [Sam] You're right.

243
00:08:07,222 --> 00:08:08,055
- And that's what's gonna
happ, she's gonna walk,

244
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:08,980
- But our.
- because you could buy

245
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,092
your way out of jail if
you have enough money.

246
00:08:11,092 --> 00:08:12,660
- And many would argue our system works,

247
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,960
in the opposite way, because
you do have women of color

248
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,100
that are locked up for, oh
I'm sorry, sending their

249
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,500
kid to a public school
in a different zip code.

250
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,790
So Al, does the judicial system
work, or does it not work,

251
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:26,160
depending on how you look
at it, inside what lens?

252
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,920
- I think it's working perfectly.

253
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,753
- [Sam] Unfortunately.

254
00:08:28,753 --> 00:08:30,788
- It caters to the rich,
I mean, if you are rich,

255
00:08:30,788 --> 00:08:33,640
you don't see jail as a deterrent.

256
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,720
Like, anybody that's got some money,

257
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,410
you can get a good attorney,
Tory you know this,

258
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:40,160
the reason lawyers cost
different amounts of money

259
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,877
and some are free, is a free
lawyer is gonna be like,

260
00:08:41,877 --> 00:08:43,810
"Sam, take the deal.",
where as a great lawyer

261
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:45,087
is gonna go through everything.

262
00:08:45,087 --> 00:08:47,160
"Did they say the, or thee
when they Mirandized you?"

263
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:47,993
They're gonna figure out
- Wow.

264
00:08:47,993 --> 00:08:49,350
- and all they need is one thing,

265
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,960
and that's why you pay that money,

266
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,670
and if you have money,
you're gonna get that lawyer,

267
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,510
and they're gonna get you off,

268
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,357
so that's why Jeff feels like that,

269
00:08:54,357 --> 00:08:55,340
'cause it's true.

270
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,980
- Yeah, it's disappointing, shame on her,

271
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,120
and shame on the judicial system,

272
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,120
- Yeah.
- We need reform,

273
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,600
and we need reform now.

314
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,870
You've been anticipating this moment,

315
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,520
since the last time you
came to Uncle Julio's.

316
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,780
Experience the unforgettable moment

317
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,970
of smashing a chocolate pinata.

318
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:55,783
Make fresh memories,
only at Uncle Julio's.

319
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,430
- WUSA 9 wants you to win
tickets to see Kidz Bop

320
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,254
live in concert on July 14th.

321
00:11:01,254 --> 00:11:04,430
(energetic music)

322
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,333
Text Kidz bop to 65047.

323
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,890
- Is your house less than perfect?

324
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:15,300
I'm Dan from MarketPro Homebuyers,

325
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,800
and we wanna buy your home.

326
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,810
- My husband and I were
faced with the decision

327
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,670
of what to do with my father's home.

328
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,670
The house required a lot of work.

329
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,950
That's when I found MarketPro Homebuyers.

330
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,030
Dan visited our home, and within minutes,

331
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,110
he gave us a quote.

332
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,360
It was so easy.

333
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,160
Dan even helped pay to pack and move us.

334
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,550
MarketPro Homebuyers
truly helped my family,

335
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,090
when we did not know what to do.

336
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:41,090
- [Dan] Call us today at 301-799-7355.

337
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:44,370
- Around here, even a little rain makes us

338
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,473
down right giddy.

339
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,530
That's because we've seen it do some

340
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,900
pretty spectacular things.

341
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,910
See for yourself at Luray Caverns.

342
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,110
What will you discover?

343
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,720
- [Announcer] A catfish exposed.

344
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,660
- You've stolen his identity.

345
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,120
- [Announcer] Will all their questions,

346
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,090
- Why our family?

347
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,670
- [Announcer] Finally be answered?

348
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,790
- How'd you get the pictures
from the inside of their house?

349
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,330
- [Announcer] Next Dr. Phil.

350
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:10,933
- Today at four, followed
by WUSA 9 news at five.

351
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:14,630
(exciting music)

352
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,930
- Welcome back to DBL, it
is time for fifth host,

353
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:19,410
when we talk about what
you're talkin' about.

354
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,910
A Texas bartender has
been arrested, and charged

355
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,430
for over serving a man, the night he shot

356
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:25,950
and killed eight people.

357
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:28,300
Lindsay Glass is accused
of violating a state law

358
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,080
by selling alcohol to an
intoxicated or insane person.

359
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,870
Police say she should have
known to stop serving the man,

360
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,240
because he appeared drunk, and armed.

361
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,480
Turned out his blood alcohol level

362
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,410
was more than four times the legal limit.

363
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:43,910
After leaving the bar, the man killed

364
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,920
his estranged wife, and seven others,

365
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,060
before dying in a police shootout.

366
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,990
The bartender now faces
up to a year in prison,

367
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:53,700
a fine of $500 or both.

368
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,780
Should she be charged with a crime?

369
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,460
Now, she wouldn't be charged for murder,

370
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,190
this would be a misdemeanor, so to speak,

371
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,280
I just wanna clarify that.

372
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,137
- Sad story, Bobby from Facebook says,

373
00:13:02,137 --> 00:13:04,117
"I think the bartender is
responsible for keeping

374
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:07,397
"patrons from becoming
unreasonably intoxicated,

375
00:13:07,397 --> 00:13:10,270
"but only the shooter is
responsible for murder."

376
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:13,220
Bobby, great take, you used
the perfect word there,

377
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,620
unreasonably intoxicated,

378
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,220
and with your BAC at four
times the legal limit,

379
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,840
that means that you
probably can't stand up.

380
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,120
The fact that this man was
armed, at least to the point

381
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,200
where she was aware of it,
I think that she should

382
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,600
be implicated in some way.

383
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,250
I don't know, my whole thing,

384
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,420
I'm not about throwing people in jail.

385
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,290
I mean, this could be used
to teach other people.

386
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,230
I mean, you shouldn't have
to teach people not to serve

387
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,270
drunk people with guns, but some people

388
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,280
gotta learn that lesson, I guess.

389
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,580
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Patty from Facebook

390
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,067
says, "Bars are just out to make money.

391
00:13:40,067 --> 00:13:42,047
"They don't care about
the dangers of alcohol.

392
00:13:42,047 --> 00:13:43,050
"This needs to change."

393
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,780
I know, Sam, you were a bartender,

394
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,734
and you can speak.
- [Sam] Jeff too.

395
00:13:45,734 --> 00:13:47,620
- And Jeff too, and there
are very strict laws

396
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,340
about serving people that
you can reasonably see

397
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,380
are over served.

398
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,610
- Oh they make an example of that.

399
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:53,443
- Yeah.
- [Jeff] Oh yeah.

400
00:13:53,443 --> 00:13:54,710
- In Los Angeles, it's
a corporation called

401
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,650
the ABC, they train you, they make sure

402
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:58,290
to let you know about those red flags,

403
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:00,710
and God forbid you over serve someone,

404
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,570
both Jeff and I have cut many people off,

405
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:04,090
but we both seen people,

406
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,400
- [Jeff] Oh yeah.
- our colleagues,

407
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,330
dragged out of that bar in handcuffs,

408
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,400
to make a point,
- [Tory] For serving.

409
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,320
- because of a DUI,
you could kill someone,

410
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,153
you could kill yourself.

411
00:14:12,153 --> 00:14:13,170
- Right, they don't bring
them out the back door,

412
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,730
they make sure all the servers see it,

413
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:15,590
they bring him out the front door,

414
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,480
they make an example,
like they handcuff 'em,

415
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,370
so it is a big deal.

416
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,810
- You're serving a drug,
- And I think it should

417
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:20,643
and I, Yeah
- Tory, alcohol's a drug.

418
00:14:20,643 --> 00:14:21,476
- And I think you should be liable,

419
00:14:21,476 --> 00:14:22,820
if you're a gun maker and you sell

420
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,780
to an underage person by
mistake, you're liable,

421
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,950
and they shoot people, you're also liable,

422
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,290
so I think she broke the law.

423
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,830
- And I do wanna set this up though.

424
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:32,040
We've talked about this story,
we set it up for a minute.

425
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,310
We don't know if this guy
was coming up to the bar,

426
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,180
we don't know the whole,
what was going on,

427
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,270
obviously I've seen someone
fall out of a chair,

428
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,350
I know to cut them off.

429
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,410
If they're all over the place,

430
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,243
and they're coming to get drinks,

431
00:14:41,243 --> 00:14:42,076
I don't know.

432
00:14:42,076 --> 00:14:42,909
I'm not responsible.

433
00:14:42,909 --> 00:14:43,930
- [Sam] Yeah, are they
drinking in the bathroom,

434
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:44,763
- Right, we don't,
- are they properly trained,

435
00:14:44,763 --> 00:14:46,230
- Did they drink before they came,

436
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,440
so there's a lot that goes in this,

437
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,340
we can't just speculate
on what the bartender

438
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,540
did or did not see.

439
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,787
But Marcus from Facebook says,

440
00:14:51,787 --> 00:14:54,047
"How would the bartender
have known what this guy

441
00:14:54,047 --> 00:14:56,027
"was going to do after he left the bar?

442
00:14:56,027 --> 00:14:58,510
"Hold people accountable
for their own actions."

443
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,770
Marcus, I love you for saying that.

444
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:02,630
Accountability, I think a word

445
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,910
that has been erased from the dictionary.

446
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,660
Be accountable for your own actions,

447
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,040
not because you're fifth
grade teacher gave you an F

448
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,610
and called you a name, that's why you went

449
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,530
and shot up everybody,
not because the bartender

450
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:14,960
over served you, that's why
you went and shot up everybody?

451
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,330
Hold this man accountable.

452
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,030
Does this lady need to do her job

453
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,480
depending on the circumstances?

454
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,313
Maybe.

455
00:15:20,313 --> 00:15:21,146
This man's accountable.

456
00:15:21,146 --> 00:15:22,050
Not anybody else.

457
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,560
He's the one who killed eight people,

458
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,393
let's not forget that.

459
00:15:24,393 --> 00:15:25,670
- Got it, all right.
- Sorry.

460
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:26,690
- Oh, great takes everybody,

461
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:27,940
thanks for writing in.

462
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,640
Coming up on DBL, eat
better, sleep better.

463
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,760
Uh-oh, I'm already sold.

00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,980
- In the connected world we live in,

473
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,580
our personal information is everywhere.

474
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,230
What happens if that information

475
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,120
gets in the hands of criminals?

476
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,930
- Someone benefited from this.

477
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,050
We were the ones on the hook for it.

478
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,620
We can't pay a $50,000 bill.

479
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,100
- Cyber criminals around
the world keep finding

480
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,720
new ways to steal your
personal information,

481
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,840
And it could be right from
your personal computer

482
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,150
or smart phone.

483
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:21,940
That's why LifeLock includes
the power of Norton.

484
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,380
For even more protection,
for your identity

485
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,210
and your devices, where so much

486
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:28,160
of your personal information lives.

487
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,410
- Knowing that Norton and
LifeLock are on my side,

488
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:34,110
makes me feel even more
confident about the protection

489
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,860
that I have for my identity.

490

- Monitoring your credit isn't enough

491
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,250
to see if your identity
is being used by thieves.

492
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,190
LifeLock helps you see more threats

493
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:44,240
like your information on the dark web.

494
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,100
And now, with the power of Norton,

on your devices, from
ransomware, spyware, and more.

497
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,500
And if you have an identity theft problem,

Scott, Mitch, and Kevin,
welcome to Daily Blast Live.

533
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,760
Pentatonix are about to
kick off a world tour,

534
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,760
but I'd like to talk to
you about your early days.

535
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,100
You guys made your mark covering
popular songs on YouTube.

536
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,680
Is there a song or artist
you have not covered yet,

537
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,893
but you've got your sights set on?

538
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:52,290
- We haven't really done
a Taylor Swift song.

539
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:53,500
We tried.
- Yeah, we could

540
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,430
do the new one.
- Yeah.

541
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:57,780
- Exactly, yeah, that'd
be really, really fun.

542
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,750
- You guys have kicked
off your world tour,

543
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,260
yet there are still some
critics who still say

544
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,650
you guys are just a cover band.

545
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:07,940
So how do you respond to
that kind of criticism?

546
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,010
- I don't think it really bothers us,

547
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,490
at the end of the day, like

548
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:12,270
we take songs that we love

549
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,220
and do them in a way
that only we can do them,

550
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,870
which is a very special ability that we've

551
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:18,770
kind of created over the past years,

552
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:19,920
and it's been really, really fun

553
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,210
getting into original music,

554
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,400
it's a journey, and we're just so thankful

555
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,020
that we get to (mumbles)

556
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,040
- I want to play a
rapid fire question game

557
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,550
with you all, I've decided I'm callin' it,

558
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:32,644
the Aca-Answers with
Pentatonix, so are you ready?

559
00:19:32,644 --> 00:19:33,535
(laughter)
- Very ready.

560
00:19:33,535 --> 00:19:34,368
- Let's go.
- Let's do it.

561
00:19:34,368 --> 00:19:35,201
(laughter)

562
00:19:35,201 --> 00:19:38,940
- First one, who in the band
is always late to rehearsal?

563
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,010
- Oh, Kirsti.

564
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,960
- I'm always like five minutes late too.

565
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,760
- Yeah, but yeah.

566
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,050
- Who is the mom of the group?

567
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,060
- Kevin, I think.

568
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,320
- Oh, that's nice.
- Yeah, you're the most

569
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,010
organized and things.
- Okay, well, thank you.

570
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,157
I appreciate that.

571
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:53,755
- Who calls their mom the most?

572
00:19:53,755 --> 00:19:54,588
- You do!

573
00:19:54,588 --> 00:19:55,421
- I call my mom everyday.

574
00:19:55,421 --> 00:19:57,730
- That's cute, good son
award, good son award.

575
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,504
Who's always taking selfies of themself?

576
00:19:59,504 --> 00:20:01,190
(camera shutter)
- Probably us.

577
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,023
- Or Kirstie.
(camera shutter)

578
00:20:02,023 --> 00:20:03,134
- Oh Kirstie does take a lot too.

579
00:20:03,134 --> 00:20:03,967
- Yeah Kirstie takes a lot.

580
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,800
- Yeah she takes a lot of selfies

581
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,633
- Who's always snacking?

582
00:20:05,633 --> 00:20:06,513
- Snacking?

583
00:20:07,821 --> 00:20:08,810
- I feel like you or me.

584
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:09,710
- Ah, me.

585
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,501
- Scott, probably Scott.

586
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,669
(laughter)

587
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:15,080
- And the last one,
now this is as a group,

588
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,640
what's your favorite song to perform?

589
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,248
- I think Bohemian Rhapsody.

590
00:20:19,248 --> 00:20:21,673
♪ Is this the real life ♪

591
00:20:21,673 --> 00:20:23,400
- [Scott] Yeah, it's a crowd pleaser.

592
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,000
- All right, so okay,
since that's your favorite,

593
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,510
do you mind giving me a little snippet?

594
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,510
- Oh my God,
- Oh my God.

595
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,120
- it's hard enough with five people,

596
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,480
we're missing some.
- We only have three

597
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,313
with us right now.

598
00:20:33,313 --> 00:20:35,776
- It would sound like nothing
if the three of us did it.

599
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,810
- I would offer my
services, but believe me,

600
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,724
your ears would be damaged for life.

601
00:20:39,724 --> 00:20:43,600
(laughter)
It'd be awful.

602
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,320
Thank you guys so much,

00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,450
were gonna try to take advantage of me.

650

- I didn't know signing papers
from the insurance company

651
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,340
could ruin my case.

652
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,270
- I didn't know having
a lawyer with experience

653
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:02,610
would make such a big
difference with my settlement.

665
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,770
with streaming apps, you miss live events,

666
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:32,310
and waste time searching for shows.

667
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,560

668

and the smells of nature.
- Ewwww!

682
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:13,380
But it's not all fun and games.

683
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,480
- This is serious business.

684

nominated for eviction.

685

- How far would you go for love?

691
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,000
- So, where you from?

692
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,110
- Nigeria.

693
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:32,660
- Wow, that's a heck of a commute, huh?

694
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:35,163

696
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,310
- Welcome back to DBL,
making the right food choices

697
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:50,900
can be tough, in today's so nutritious,

698
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,650
sponsored by SoClean,
Tory Shulman meets up

699
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:56,004
with a nutritionist to learn about foods

700
00:24:56,004 --> 00:24:57,290
that'll help you sleep better.

701
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:58,480
Take a look.

702
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,730
- Hey guys, we are here
with Sara Peternell,

703
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:02,630
she is a holistic nutritionist,

704
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:04,330
at Family Nutrition Services,

705
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:08,780
and she is here to tell us,
how food can affect your sleep.

706
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:11,600
I know, mind blown.

707
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,190
Talk to me about how sleep
and eating go together,

708
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,670
'cause I never thought about that.

709
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:17,810
- Absolutely, who hasn't
had trouble sleeping,

710
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:19,010
- Yes!
- at one point or another,

711
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:20,140
I know I have.

712
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,680
- What are some specific foods,

713
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,900
so I know to stock?

714
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,440
- There are foods that are rich

715
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,220
in an amino acid called tryptophan.

716
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,120
The first one is--

717
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,190
- Turkey, yeah, yeah.
- you said it.

718
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,100
Exactly, that's why everybody's

719
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,220
so sleepy on Thanksgiving.

720
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,053
- Right.

721
00:25:31,053 --> 00:25:32,250
- But nuts are a really good

722
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:34,520
accessible source of tryptophan.

723
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,210
Almonds, brazil nuts, walnuts,

724
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:39,270
just eating a quarter
cup of these per day,

725
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:41,740
can really help to boost
your tryptophan levels,

726
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,860
which converts in the body to serotonin.

727
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,380
- Wow, so you'd be nuts not to do it.

728
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,514
- You would be totally
nuts not to do (laughs).

729
00:25:46,514 --> 00:25:47,347
- Sorry.

730
00:25:47,347 --> 00:25:48,930
All right, so what else other than nuts?

731
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:51,710
- So my favorite one of
all is actually cherries.

732
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:54,060
Cherries, when they contain melatonin,

733
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,380
they actually just help to contribute

734
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,690
to your bodies own
production of melatonin.

735
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,670
This sleep hormone is one of the hormones

736
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:01,560
that regulates like our circadian rhythm.

737
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,920
- So cherries, nuts, what else?

738
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,987
- Fish, is actually a sleep remedy,

739
00:26:06,987 --> 00:26:07,907
- Really?
- and it's not thought of,

740
00:26:07,907 --> 00:26:10,610
but it should be because
it has a very high level

741
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,240
of vitamin B6.

742
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,920
- And B6 helps you sleep?

743
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,900
- Vitamin B6 is actually
important for that conversion

744
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,780
of tryptophan to serotonin.

745
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,540
- Oh, I see.
- So when we're talking about

746
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,740
nuts, you know, we use the
amino acid in our bodies

747
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:26,530
to convert to serotonin,
but if you're low in B6,

748
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:29,860
that conversion doesn't take
place quite as naturally.

749
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,130
- I want to thank Sarah Peternell

750
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:33,730
for dealing with me first
off, and for teaching us

751
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:35,840
some accessible things
you can do right now,

752
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,840
at the grocery store,
to help your own body

753
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,830
naturally get to some Z's.

754
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,360
- I guess I need to stock up on cherries,

755
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,550
'cause momma hasn't been sleepin'.

756
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,510
- You've been having some trouble,

757
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,580
and she also mentioned to me yogurt.

758
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,770
So if you make a smoothie
and include all of this,

759
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:50,490
yogurt, cherries, walnuts,

760
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:53,860
you can sort of make a
sleepy time smoothie.

761
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,240
So if you think maybe you know,

762
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,410
right when you're feeding Sof,

763
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:58,410
maybe you give yourself a
little sleepy time smoothie,

764
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:00,734
and you get in the mood to sleep.

765
00:27:00,734 --> 00:27:02,540
(laughter)

766
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:06,423
