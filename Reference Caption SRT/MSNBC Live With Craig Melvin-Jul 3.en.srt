1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,073
- There you go.

2
00:00:02,073 --> 00:00:04,480
I think the entire country
is rooting for those women.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,490
We know that the White House
just announced this hour,

4
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:08,860
they're sending a delegation
over to the game in France,

5
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,410
led by the Deputy Commerce
Secretary and others.

6
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:12,510
It is gonna be a big one.

7
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,490
Nancy Cook, Tamara Keith,
thank you for coming

8
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:15,700
on the show and thank you guys all

9
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,280
for watching this hour of MSNBC Live.

10
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,750
Craig Melvin, where are you gonna be

11
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,770
watching the game, my friend?

12
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,930
- Go team USA.

13
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,880
I'll be watching from the comfy confines

14
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,713
of my basement.

15
00:00:23,713 --> 00:00:24,670
My favorite place in the world.

16
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,340
- Very nice, big screen.

17
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,173
Love it.
- Thank you Hallie.

18
00:00:27,173 --> 00:00:28,006
Thank you, thank you.

19
00:00:28,006 --> 00:00:30,470
Craig Melvin here, MSNBC
Headquarters, New York City.

20
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,570
Tanks in position.

21
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,000
Preparations underway
for President Trump's

22
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,390
big Fourth of July event.

23
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,190
Including those military
vehicles now on the National Mall

24
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:43,550
as new details about
how it's being paid for

25
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,400
are generating more fury.

26
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,380
Also, Hawkeye swing, 2020 candidates

27
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,980
making there way to Iowa for the holiday

28
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,330
as a new poll of voters in that state

29
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:56,540
reveals some new challenges
for some of those contenders.

30
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,240
Two of the Democratic
contenders will join me

31
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,950
live this hour, two of them.

32
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,890
Also, ticking time bomb.

33
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,420
That is how one official
in a new government

34
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,730
Watchdog Report describes
the horrific conditions

35
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,430
inside migrant detention facilities.

36
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:16,410
It includes shocking
new images from inside.

37
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,370
We'll get to that story in just a moment,

38
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,930
but we start with those
tanks and military vehicles

39
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,520
descending on the National Mall

40
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,230
for President Trump's self-produced

41
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,240
Fourth of July event tomorrow.

42
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,160
In a break from tradition,
the President has ordered

43
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,500
a display of American
military might in the Capital.

44
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,870
That plan, its meaning, and its cost

45
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,260
all stirring controversy.

46
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:43,010
Joining me now NBC's Monica
Alba live on the National Mall.

47
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,690
Ashley Parker, White House reporter

48
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,060
for the Washington Post.

49
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,480
She's an MSNBC Senior Political Analyst.

50
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,750
Democratic Congressman
Don Bayer is with me.

51
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,300
His district includes Northern Virginia,

52
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,550
those D.C. suburbs and
Washington Post opinion writer,

53
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,530
Jennifer Rubin is with me
and so is Mark Updegrove,

54
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:03,480
Presidential Historian,
also the President and CEO

55
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,020
of the LBJ Foundation.

56
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,300
Quite the esteemed panel here.

57
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,840
Monica, I'll start with you.

58
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,283
What are we seeing
there on the Mall today?

59
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,520
- So Craig actually if I turn here

60
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,130
you're gonna see two
Bradley Fighting Vehicles

61
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,650
and these are just some
of the military might

62
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,310
that's gonna be on
display tomorrow evening.

63
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,300
This is of course being transported

64
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,150
on such a large flatbed
because of how heavy they are.

65
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,300
The Abrams tanks, which are other tanks

66
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,550
that are parked nearby and
going to be on the Mall,

67
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,230
weigh as much as 60 tons.

68
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,520
So you can imagine that's something

69
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,390
that could damage D.C.
streets and of course

70
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,500
some of the President's critics

71
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,700
have expressed concerns about that,

72
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,070
but that is exactly what the
President wants on display.

73
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,360
He wants to do the Salute to America

74
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,940
and feature all of these different

75
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,360
military vehicles after being inspired

76
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,640
two years ago at the Bastille
Day celebrations in Paris

77
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,360
where he saw the parade with
President Emmanuel Macron

78
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,440
and said I would very
much like to do this.

79
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,150
He then thought it was gonna be actually

80
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:04,340
taking place on Veterans
Day, but that got canceled,

81
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,640
you may remember, and
moved to the Fourth of July

82
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,770
because of how expensive it is.

83
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:09,980
The Washington Post is reporting

84
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,720
that it's gonna be at least 2.5 million

85
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,100
in entrance fees redirected to account

86
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,690
for the event tomorrow and of course

87
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,220
we don't know what the cost is yet

88
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,190
of the other military flyovers.

89
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,810
The President has tweeted
that a lot of that

90
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,360
is going to be free because
we own the equipment,

91
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,800
but you have to think about the security

92
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,470
and other concerns, other things

93
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,010
that are going to kind of
put that price tag up high

94
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,790
and we don't know how
much that's going to cost.

95
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,970
Now, these tanks and military vehicles

96
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,400
are gonna be moved.

97
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,420
We don't know exactly when.

98
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,410
We're just steps from
the Lincoln Memorial,

99
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,700
but they're all going to be placed

100
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,150
up and down the Mall,
but we don't know exactly

101
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,860
how many there are gonna be and tomorrow

102
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,540
a lot of the excitement is around

103
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,140
of course the military flyovers

104
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,670
and then also what's expected to be

105
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,730
a fly over of Air Force One.

106
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,370
So a lot of spectacle
tomorrow evening, Craig,

107
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,480
but that's the scene
from here the day before.

108
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,620
- All right Monica Alba there.

109
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,920
Monica, thank you.

110
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,940
Ashley, your paper reporting

111
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,040
that the National Park Service

112
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,930
is diverting $2.5 million in park fees

113
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,340
to pay for this story.

114
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,450
The story adds, quote,
the diverted park fees

115
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,530
represent just a fraction
of the extra costs

116
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,410
the government faces as
a result of the event,

117
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:16,070
which will include displays
of military hardware,

118
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:19,000
flyovers by an array of jets
including Air Force One,

119
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,870
the deployment of tanks on the Mall

120
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:24,110
and an extended pyrotechnics show.

121
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:27,250
Is there a concern at the White House

122
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,200
of just the sheer optics of spending

123
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,073
so much money on this
extravaganza at this point?

124
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,560
- Well there's certainly not
concern from the President,

125
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,930
this is what he wants,

126
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,550
but you can see in that tweet he sent

127
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:42,910
that he is certainly
aware of the criticism.

128
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:43,930
That's something the White House

129
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,760
has been very cognizant of,
when the Post first reported,

130
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,070
I believe that there were gonna be

131
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,900
sort of a longer fireworks
display than usual

132
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,900
because some companies had volunteered

133
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,733
to help with that.

134
00:04:54,733 --> 00:04:56,190
One thing that the White House really

135
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,300
tried to make clear was that you know

136
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,560
these were sort of not
quite free firework shows,

137
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,720
but at a reduced rate
and that the President

138
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,280
would sort of be foolish not to take

139
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,960
these companies up on the offer.

140
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,480
So they are aware of this criticism

141
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,210
and keep in mind, you
mentioned this earlier,

142
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,260
but the whole reason that his plans

143
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,250
for a Veterans Day parade were scuttled

144
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,240
was because the price tag,

145
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,810
I believe it got to about 90 million,

146
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,430
but it was just way too high.

147
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,010
There was a ton of outcry,

148
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,370
including from the D.C. government,

149
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,030
it was not logistically feasible.

150
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:28,190
So again the President
may not care necessarily,

151
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:31,060
he's clearly preceding full steam ahead,

152
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,020
but that tweet shows
and other conversations

153
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,680
we've had with the White House shows

154
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,020
that they are at least aware
that there is a number,

155
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,230
there is a lot of criticism
coming from all sides.

156
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,280
- Ashley, what else do we know about this

157
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,040
reporting on the Republican
National Committee,

158
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,080
they received a number of VIP tickets

159
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,990
that they're handing out as well?

160
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,653
Are they handing out tickets
to a taxpayer funded event?

161
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,000
- Well there is concern, there has

162
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,340
been a lot of fair criticism about that

163
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,470
for sort of politicizing, you know,

164
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:04,100
one of these rare things in
the nation that is apolitical,

165
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,720
a holiday that is symbolic
and about fireworks

166
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,570
and spending time with
families and barbecues.

167
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,580
They've sort of tried to argue

168
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,970
this is no different than sometimes

169
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:14,970
tickets are handed out for
say the Easter Egg Roll

170
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,540
or something else on the South Lawn,

171
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,710
but the other thing
that is worth mentioning

172
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,620
that we're hearing is there's also

173
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,320
a lot of kind of quiet chatter

174
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,740
in the President's orbit that they are

175
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,480
deeply worried about sort of
another Inauguration fiasco,

176
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,290
which of course--
- No one's gonna show up.

177
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,810
- Right, that the President's crowds

178
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,980
were not as big as his predecessors

179
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,630
and that yeah exactly
that no one will show up.

180
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,700
What happens if it rains?

181
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,130
What happens is if we're hearing a lot

182
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:41,203
of people in D.C., a deeply blue state,

183
00:06:41,203 --> 00:06:44,160
not state, but district who are not fans

184
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,830
of the President are fleeing town.

185
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,280
So, part of that it seems is designed

186
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,660
to kind of ensure that at
least for the camera shot

187
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,410
that it looks like it is packed

188
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,610
and there's not these sort of splotches

189
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,550
of green grass where the President

190
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,050
wants a huge crowd behind
him, celebrating him.

191
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,230
- Mark, give us some perspective here.

192
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:06,550
How unusual is it to
have a military display

193
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:09,500
and for a President to speak from the Mall

194
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,780
in the way that he is reportedly going to

195
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,780
on Independence Day, unprecedented or not?

196
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,460
- Well like almost everything
this President does,

197
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,840
this is unprecedented.

198
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,280
This is a kind of military display

199
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,080
that we were used to seeing
from the Soviet Union

200
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,590
on Red Square, on May Day, this is not

201
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:29,360
the kind of thing that we do as a nation.

202
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,900
We show fireworks, we have parades,

203
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,430
but we don't show our military hardware

204
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,520
to the nation and to the world,

205
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,840
but I think this is a President

206
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,920
who very much wants to
be seen as a strong man,

207
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,820
not only to his own citizens,

208
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,980
but to citizens of the world.

209
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,540
So it's not surprising that Donald Trump

210
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,600
would want to do a display like this.

211
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,160
- Congressman Beyer, you represent

212
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,820
Virginia's eighth district,
home of the Pentagon.

213
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:01,000
You're just across the
river from Washington D.C.

214
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,480
What's your objection
to what the President

215
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,220
has planned for the Fourth?

216
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,280
- Melvin I have three big,

217
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,620
first that he's taken something

218
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,380
that's always been bipartisan.

219
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,580
I grew up in the city and my dad

220
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,170
would load the six kids of us,

221
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:15,000
take us down to the Mall with the blanket

222
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,960
and the picnic basket and now it's turned

223
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,550
into this major partisan thing.

224
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,620
I'm still encouraging our folks to go

225
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,170
'cause I don't want it to be divisive.

226
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,680
I also really object
to the militarization.

227
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,670
I thought the historian put it out well.

228
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:31,810
When I think of tanks and
troops walking down the middle,

229
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:36,790
I'm thinking Red Square,
North Korea, Egypt,

230
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:37,850
not the United States.

231
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,520
Where we're gonna spend three quarters

232
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,510
of a trillion dollars
next year on our military,

233
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,320
everyone knows we're the
most powerful military

234
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,900
in the world.

235
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,350
- You also, as I understand it,

236
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:52,320
you are calling for the
President to personally reimburse

237
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,480
taxpayers for any infrastructure damage

238
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,480
caused by military hardware
brought in for the celebration.

239
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:02,240
I think you and I both know

240
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,790
the President's not going to do that,

241
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,980
but what is your goal with that demand?

242
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,180
- Well he's famous for
not paying his bills.

243
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,110
I think he still owes
the District $53 million

244
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,880
un-reimbursed from the Inauguration.

245
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,990
It's just to make the point

246
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:18,990
that when you take these very
weighty 60 ton Abrams tanks

247
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,130
and put them next to the Lincoln Memorial,

248
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,260
who knows what it's doing to D.C. roads.

249
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,840
There's some concern from the Park Service

250
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,530
that the basements under
the Lincoln Memorial

251
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,350
may not be able to hold this up.

252
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,520
It's just in a time when the Park Service

253
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,810
has an 11 or 12 billion
dollar infrastructure backlog

254
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:38,500
to be redirecting funds
for his vanity show

255
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,860
just doesn't make any sense.

256
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,870
- [Craig] Congressman Beyer,
I appreciate your time, Sir,

257
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,120
thank you, and to be clear,

258
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,170
you're going to go,
you're going to be there?

259
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,470
- I am gonna go on the
Eastern Shore with my family,

260
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,878
but so no I will not be there.

261
00:09:48,878 --> 00:09:50,750
- [Craig] You'll be
watching on television.

262
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,289
- But not out of protest,
previously planned.

263
00:09:53,289 --> 00:09:57,360
- [Craig] But you're encouraging
your constituents to go.

264
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,400
- Yeah, only because he's
the most divisive president

265
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,160
we've ever had but one
of our great challenges

266
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,730
is that we live in a divided country

267
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,890
and we need to be do our best to heal

268
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,790
and they don't have to
listen to his speech,

269
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,560
but they should enjoy the fireworks.

270
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,080
- But why encourage them to
go if you're not going to go?

271
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,050
- Well if I were in town I probably would,

272
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,170
but my wife and kids are
already on the Eastern Shore.

273
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,490
- Got it, got it, Congressman, thank you.

274
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,290
Thank you for your time.

275
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:26,120
Jennifer, I want to call your
attention to this survey.

276
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,760
There's a survey of American Pride,

277
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,550
it's from Gallup and
according to this survey,

278
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:35,960
45% of folks who are
polled are extremely proud

279
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,100
to be an American, that's
the second straight year

280
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,330
of the sub 50% readings.

281
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:43,050
That percentage has been
weakening in recent years.

282
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:45,023
To what do you attribute the drop?

283
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,140
- Well, first of all, I
won't be going to the Mall

284
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,970
and it will be in protest.

285
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,870
So, good for the Congressman,
he's a better person than I.

286
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,530
I think people are deeply
disturbed with what this president

287
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:00,520
has been doing to our
Democratic institutions,

288
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,210
to the rule of law, to
separation of powers,

289
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,360
his disrespect for the First Amendment,

290
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,400
calling the press the enemy of the people.

291
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,730
For better or worse the
President of the United States

292
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,980
embodies the country to some degree.

293
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,610
He is both the Head of State
and the Head of Government

294
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:17,210
and when people look at Donald Trump

295
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,370
as their representative
on the world stage,

296
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,390
they are not proud of him.

297
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,830
They find him tacky, they find him crude,

298
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:28,370
racist, homophobic, misogynistic,
you can go down the list,

299
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,420
and I think that deeply worries people

300
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:34,590
and I think you see that in the
Democratic presidential race

301
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:37,360
where these people are
essentially running on a platform

302
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,773
to restore American values
of decency, inclusiveness,

303
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:46,400
generosity, community,

304
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,600
because we haven't gotten
that from this president.

305
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,850
He's notoriously awful on
these moments when you look

306
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:55,400
to the president to heal,
to bring us together.

307
00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:00,360
He is the anti-uniter and
this is just one more display,

308
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,690
it's also really a
contempt for government.

309
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:07,040
This is the mother of
all Hatch Act violations.

310
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,690
This is using the taxpayer's
money, the taxpayer's property,

311
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,810
really, for his own vanity

312
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:16,710
and whether it's a legal violation or not,

313
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:20,650
it is so unseemly and I would
just add one final thing.

314
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:23,860
Seeing tanks on the
Mall has the appearance

315
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,170
that Washington is an occupied city.

316
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:29,850
We put tanks on the street
when there is a civil uprising,

317
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,390
when there is a calamity of some type.

318
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:35,000
There is not and Donald Trump doesn't get

319
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,990
that this is not a symbol
of pride or of American,

320
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,770
but that this is a deeply disturbing sign

321
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:44,830
that he is politicizing the military

322
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:48,380
and militarizing the
politics of our country.

323
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:52,360
- Mark, are we at a
point now where we can't

324
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,213
separate our patriotism
from the President?

325
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:02,480
- Well, I think those plunging
numbers around American pride

326
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,270
are totally reflective of the fact

327
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,500
that we're in a polarized nation.

328
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,300
We have a president who is leading

329
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,700
through division and discord.

330
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,730
You're seeing that
number increase slightly

331
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:16,890
among Republicans and
plunge among Democrats.

332
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:19,490
We are a very divided society,

333
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:22,810
but I worry too, Craig,
about what Ronald Reagan

334
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:26,190
warned about in his
Farewell Address in 1989,

335
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:29,860
he talked about the eradication
of the American memory

336
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,610
and the erosion of the American spirit,

337
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:36,830
by which he meant we're not
studying civics and history

338
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,280
in our schools anymore.

339
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,340
We're looking only at the moment right now

340
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:44,710
in American history and what
Donald Trump means to America,

341
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:48,310
not the larger American story
and I think if Americans,

342
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:50,940
more Americans were to
understand more about civics

343
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,540
and about American history,

344
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,080
they would have pride in our nation

345
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,600
knowing that sometimes
we go through good times

346
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,300
and sometimes we go through bad times,

347
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,710
but we are a strong and
resilient nation ultimately.

348
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,600
- On this eve of the Fourth of July,

349
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,620
that seems an appropriate spot to end it.

350
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,840
Thank you so much for that, Mark.

351
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,680
Thank you, Ashley.

352
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,910
Thank you, Jennifer,
and thank you, Monica.

353
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,280
I do appreciate your reporting.

354
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:17,280
Dangerous conditions, children
laying on top of each other,

355
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:22,000
cells packed at five times their capacity.

356
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,330
New images being released

357
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,360
as part of a government Watchdog Report

358
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,470
on conditions inside those
migrant detention facilities,

359
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:32,080
it's triggering more
outrage across the country

360
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,480
and on the campaign trail.

361
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,540
I'll talk about it with one of

362
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,650
the Democratic presidential contenders.

363
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,330
Washington Governor Jay Inslee

364
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:41,850
will join me on the
other side of this break.

365
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,930
Later in this hour another contender,

366
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:47,250
Ohio Congressman Tim
Ryan, will also join me.

367
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:51,150
He's got a warning for his party
on the issue of immigration

368
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:54,363
and what it could mean
for the presidential race.

369
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,330
- [Announcer] Stay tuned to get

370
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,530
a free pan from Granitestone.

371
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:02,020
Stuck on eggs, burnt on batter.

372
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,560
You can scrub and scrape,

373
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:08,200
but you can't escape the
nightmare of your sticky pans.

374
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,500
Introducing the Granitestone pan.

375
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,210
The all new durable, non-stick pan.

376
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:14,860
No butter or oil needed.

377
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:18,237
Watch, we melted down these
sticky candies in Granitestone

378
00:15:18,237 --> 00:15:19,950
and it just doesn't stick!

379
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:22,080
We cooked a half a dozen eggs, bacon,

380
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,580
cheese, and tomato breakfast

381
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:27,230
with no butter or oil and
it just doesn't stick.

382
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,063
Look!

383
00:15:28,063 --> 00:15:29,740
Caramels, chocolate and cheese!

384
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:33,240
Unreal for any other pan,
but not for Granitestone.

385
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,830
It just doesn't stick.

386
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:37,410
Granitestone will be the
last pan you'll ever need

387
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,760
because it's pressed from
a solid aluminum disk

388
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,920
for even heat conduction,
then coated three times

389
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,270
with our durable Granitestone finish.

390
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,330
Granitestone is metal utensil safe

391
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:49,860
and won't scratch and
talk about non-stick.

392
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,840
This salmon cooked skin side down

393
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,800
with no added butter or
oil just doesn't stick.

394
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,900
This steak is perfectly
seared just like the pros

395
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:01,440
and because Granitestone is
oven rated to 500 degrees,

396
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,630
we baked this upside down
pan pizza to perfection

397
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,540
and it just doesn't stick.

398
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,080
Fire flambe delicious cherries jubilee,

a, quote, ticking time bomb.

00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:27,790
How would they change in
an Inslee Administration?

478
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:30,210
- Well, we would stop the gross inhumanity

479
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,370
and you need to understand

480
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,430
the depth of depravity of Donald Trump.

481
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:38,190
These conditions are an
intentional action by him.

482
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,260
He has made it very clear

483
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,180
that he wants to make people afraid

484
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,910
and he likes these inhumane conditions

485
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:48,430
because it is part of his intention

486
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:51,670
to fan the flame of
discord around immigration

487
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:56,400
and instead of uniting us to
find a comprehensive solution,

488
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,150
instead of trying to
address the root causes

489
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:01,990
of this immigration problem to keep people

490
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,820
where they live and not
force them to come north,

491
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:08,860
he has decided to utilize
inhumane conditions

492
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:11,650
as a tool of his gross cruelty.

493
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:14,850
We need to understand how
deep this depravity is.

494
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:18,940
So we need to have both
additional capacity for people,

495
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,020
but we need to go back,

496
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,870
what we've done for 50 years,

497
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:25,260
as a judge ordered yesterday in Seattle,

498
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,790
to allow people to be released on bond

499
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,940
in the appropriate circumstances,

500
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,270
where as much as 80 or 90% of people

501
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,860
do return for their immigration hearings.

502
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,290
We've done that for 50 years in America.

503
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,530
He has departed from American tradition.

504
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,880
We need to go back to that.

505
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,990
- Last night fellow Democratic candidate,

506
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:45,770
former Housing Secretary Julian Castro,

507
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,610
he appeared on Rachel Maddow

508
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,700
and he laid out his immigration plan.

509
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,533
Take a listen.

510
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:53,830
- I'm gonna offer a
completely different vision

511
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,530
of what we should do on immigration

512
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:58,270
to make sure that we have
an immigration system

513
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:01,550
that's fixed, that works
with border security,

514
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:04,350
but that never treats
people like this again.

515
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:07,950
I believe one centerpiece of
that is repealing Section 13-25

516
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,790
of the Immigration Nationality Act,

517
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:12,730
so that not only this
president but future presidents

518
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,680
can't ever use that law
to incarcerate parents

519
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,090
and then separate them
from their little children.

520
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,940
- Do you agree with Castro's
stance that crossing

521
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,520
the border illegally
should be criminalized?

522
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,700
- We should not use criminal statutes

523
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,420
to separate children from
their parents, period,

524
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,350
and if that's being used for that purpose

525
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:37,610
it should not be used for that
purpose and is not required.

526
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:41,190
Look we have lots of
civil systems to be able

527
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:44,650
to prevent illegal entry
into the United States

528
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:47,450
and to use Donald Trump's separation

529
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:50,840
of children from parents, which
he has done intentionally,

530
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,380
should not be allowed
through criminal statutes

531
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,720
in the United States and I want to repeat,

532
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,170
look, for 50 years we've had a system

533
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:03,810
of being able to allow people
to have a hearing on asylum

534
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:06,680
without separating children
from their parents,

535
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,840
we need to restore that
basic American value.

536
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,200
- I want to highlight something

537
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,610
from the new Washington
Post ABC News poll.

538
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:15,120
It was taken since last week's NBC debate,

539
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,690
29% of Democratic voters say healthcare

540
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:22,100
is one of the most important issues

541
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,180
they're going to be voting
on, topped the list in fact.

542
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:28,240
You have relied heavily on climate change.

543
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,550
You've drilled down on climate change.

544
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,840
What do you offer voters who are looking

545
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,730
for someone to tackle our
nation's healthcare issues?

546
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:38,760
- Well, we have done so much
in our state successfully,

547
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,300
not just in addressing the climate crisis.

548
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,660
We've adopted the very
first public health option

549
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,920
in the United States.

550
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,753
We're proud of that.

551
00:22:47,753 --> 00:22:49,790
I'm the first governor to actually

552
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:52,850
work with our community
to pass those bills,

553
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:55,420
but we've done so much on our other issues

554
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,830
to help families health,
health is not just

555
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:00,840
the healthcare system, you
gotta have a family wage.

556
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,640
That's why I'm proud to say we've adopted

557
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,660
while I'm governor the
highest minimum wage

558
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,850
in the United States.

559
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:07,810
You have to be able to
take care of your family

560
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,810
when they're sick and that's why we have

561
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:13,280
the most robust, comprehensive
family medical leave

562
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,190
in the United States.

563
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:16,910
You have to have a decent wage in general

564
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:19,180
that's why I'm proud of we've won

565
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,970
the highest educator compensation increase

566
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:24,870
for our teachers and educators
in the United States.

567
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,530
We have wrap around services of being able

568
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:30,980
to build a middle class, that's
how you really have health,

569
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,460
but I do want to come back to this issue.

570
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:37,470
Look this is a health issue
of this climate crisis

571
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:42,470
it's increasing Lyme disease,
it's respiratory distress,

572
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:46,520
it's an epidemic of asthma,
it's your town burning down

573
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,900
where 80 plus people
have died in forest fires

574
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,860
in California last year.

575
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,540
The climate crisis is a health issue

576
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:57,720
and I am offering a unique emphasis on it.

577
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,987
I am the candidate and
so far the only candidate

578
00:23:59,987 --> 00:24:02,130
who said this will be
the number one priority

579
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:02,963
of the United States.

580
00:24:02,963 --> 00:24:06,140
This is a health issue, it
is a national security issue,

581
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,200
it is an economic issue
all rolled into one.

582
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,300
- [Craig] It is your central message.

583
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,133
- You bet.

584
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:13,160
- The latest CNN poll, let's
talk about another poll,

585
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,610
it shows your movement
over the last four months,

586
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:17,070
it shows in March, April, and June

587
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:20,170
you were registering at about 1%.

588
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:23,740
In the most recent poll,
you're now at an asterisk.

589
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:28,653
Is it that message or is
it perhaps the messenger?

590
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,320
- Well listen we started at about one,

591
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,150
were about one now in the last polls.

592
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:37,230
We're where Clinton and
Carter were when they started.

593
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:40,240
We are still introducing
ourselves to the American people,

594
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,610
less than a third of the people

595
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:43,330
could pick me out of a line up.

596
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:46,070
This is a start, we've had some confidence

597
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:49,540
since the last debate we
had a surge of support

598
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:52,300
with the largest number
of donors in 24 hours

599
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,100
since I started, we had the largest number

600
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,240
of new donors and we encourage folks

601
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,170
to go to jayinslee.com if they want

602
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:01,120
to see the climate crisis

603
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,590
to remain a central focus in our debate.

604
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,000
- You're talking numbers here.

605
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,610
You've got some
fundraising numbers for us?

606
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:09,780
- Yeah, they're going up.

607
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,240
I don't have a total number for you.

608
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,050
I haven't totaled them for the quarter,

609
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:15,900
but we did have the best
day, the best two days

610
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,720
that we've had during the campaign

611
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,210
after the last debate and I think it is

612
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:21,760
because people want to see

613
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,720
the climate crisis front and center.

614
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,690
- Yesterday, Senator
Sanders put out his numbers,

615
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:26,910
he was around 24 million.

616
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,820
The day before that Mayor
Pete put out his numbers,

617
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,200
he was around 24 million.

618
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,880
Are you around 24 million?

619
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,610
- No, we won't be in that same league

620
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:35,730
because we're still introducing ourselves

621
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:37,790
and we're making sure
that the climate crisis

622
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:40,760
and by the way I was honored the other day

623
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,500
someone evaluated our
respective climate plans

624
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,750
and ours was held to be the number one.

625
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,430
I'm proud of that and I think

626
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:49,890
that is what is necessary for our nation

627
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:52,330
to address something that is burning down

628
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:54,560
our towns and flooding our fields

629
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,880
and if people want to see that

630
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,510
they can go to jayinslee.com.

631
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,560
- Governor Inslee, thank you.

632
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,340
Thanks for your time, Sir.
- You bet.

633
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,610
- Top tier shuffle, how the latest

634

post NBC News debate poll shaking up

635
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:08,120
some of the top contenders as Joe Biden

636
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,610
remains at the top spot though.

637
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,550
We're gonna go live to
Iowa where an onslaught

638
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:13,660
of candidates are hitting
the ground for holiday.

639
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,070
We'll catch up with our road warriors

640
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,280
in the Hawkeye State.

641
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,862
This is a live look at Des Moines.

642
00:26:17,862 --> 00:26:20,362
(light music)

643
00:26:23,908 --> 00:26:26,660
(tense music)
- This is political insanity.

00:26:29,133 --> 00:26:31,260
- Name one of the Democratic contenders.

647
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:34,340
Name one that you are
positive can beat Trump.

651
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:51,600
- [Announcer] Corey is living
with metastatic breast cancer

652
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,100
which is breast cancer that has spread

653
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,483
to other parts of her body.

654
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,900
She's also taking Ibrance
with an aromatase inhibitor

655
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,560
which is for postmenopausal women

656
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:04,520
or for men with HR+ HER2-
metastatic breast cancer

657
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,810
as the first hormonal-based therapy.

658
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:09,580
Ibrance plus letrozole was
significantly more effective

659
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:12,470
at delaying disease
progression versus letrozole.

660
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:14,240
Patients taking Ibrance can develop

661
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,570
low white blood cell counts,

662
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:18,370
which may cause a serious
infections that can lead to death.

663
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,210
Before taking Ibrance tell your doctor

664
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,570
if you have fever, chills,

665
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:24,300
or other signs of infection,
liver or kidney problems,

666
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,110
are pregnant, breastfeeding
or plan to become pregnant.

667
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:29,350
Common side effects
include low red blood cell

668
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,280
and low platelet counts, infections,

669
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,030
tiredness, nausea, sore
mouth, abnormalities

670
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:37,090
in liver blood tests, diarrhea,
hair thinning or loss,

671
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:39,910
vomiting, rash, and loss of appetite.

672
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:43,720
Corey calls it her new normal
because a lot has changed,

673
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,700
but a lot hasn't.

674
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,700
Ask your doctor about Ibrance.

675
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,810
The number one prescribed, FDA approved

676

2020 Democratic presidential candidates

734

are swarming Iowa preparing
for a long holiday weekend.

735
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,800
There's a look at 'em there.

736
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,603
A new poll from the Washington Post

737
00:30:21,603 --> 00:30:24,060
and ABC News sheds some light on how

738
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:28,540
they are stacking up at
this early point in the race

739
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,490
and the latest poll since
the NBC News debate,

740
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,580
Joe Biden's lead over
his closest competitors

741
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,500
shrank to just six points.

742
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,650
Bernie Sanders holding on to
that second spot in the poll.

743
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:40,330
Elizabeth Warren holding steady at 11%.

744
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:45,187
The biggest jump, Senator
Kamala Harris also at 11%,

745
00:30:45,187 --> 00:30:48,420
but this poll is unique
because it also asked,

746
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,670
it asked voters for a second choice.

747
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:52,430
When you look at whether
one of these candidates

748
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:54,390
is someone's first or second choice,

749
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:57,710
Joe Biden has the support
of half the primary voters

750
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:00,130
and that's with more than
20 people in this race,

751
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:01,600
Sanders hits 40%,

752
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,897
Elizabeth Warren, as
you can see there, 25%,

753
00:31:03,897 --> 00:31:07,430
Kamala Harris right there as well, 24%.

Mike, I'll start with you.

761
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:26,990
This is Biden's first campaign
rally since those debates,

762
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,053
what's the plan?

763
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,770
- Well Craig there's no doubt that

764
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:33,500
a lot has changed for the Biden campaign

765
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,680
ahead of what is his third trip to Iowa

766
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,010
since announcing his candidacy in April.

767
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:40,200
He was behind me here in Cedar Rapids

768
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,720
on that first trip in
April saying at the time

769
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,610
that no one was gonna work harder than him

770
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,360
to win the support of Iowa voters.

771
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,440
That second trip to Iowa about a month ago

772
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,610
you'll remember that he was here

773
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:51,300
at the same time as President Trump,

774
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,140
it really gave Biden an opportunity

775
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:55,410
to really frame that
general election matchup,

776
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:58,170
of course electability being
one of the strongest arguments

777
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:00,490
that Joe Biden has so far, but as I said

778
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:02,290
there's no doubt when you
talk to Biden advisors

779
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:03,700
that they feel the game has changed.

780
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,410
Game on as one advisor said.

781
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:06,450
You look at some of these polls

782
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:08,360
that show him slipping after that

783
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,820
shaky debate performance.

784
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,410
A senior Biden campaign advisor

785
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:13,230
tells me listen we're no more worried

786
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,830
about these latest polls that show

787
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:17,180
a little bit of a dip,
that we were overconfident

788
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,880
based on those initial
polls that showed him

789
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,630
with a strong lead, but we
are seeing him now recognize

790
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:23,470
that he can't just stay above the fray

791
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,520
in the terms of running
in the Democratic Primary

792
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,770
and what will be interesting, Craig,

793
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:29,010
we're gonna see Joe Biden campaigning

794
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:32,030
on the Fourth of July
tomorrow in Independence, Iowa

795
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:33,770
at the same time as Beto O'Rourke

796
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:35,300
another one of his contenders.

797
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:38,360
Also, Craig, tomorrow night Joe Biden

798
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,450
will also be attending an Iowa Cubs game

799
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:42,260
also with Beto O'Rourke which means

800
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,120
for me on the Fourth of July I get paid

801
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,430
to attend a minor league baseball game.

802
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,490
Sounds good to me.

803
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,630
- That's true, it's a good point.

804
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,410
Mr. Hillard, I turn to you.

805
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:54,050
How does the Harris
camp plan to capitalize

806
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:56,960
on this post-NBC News debate momentum?

807
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,053
Any ideas there?

808
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:01,760
- Well how they're gonna capitalize,

809
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,200
they're here for three straight
days of campaign events.

810
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,040
She'll be just next
door in West Des Moines

811
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,840
this afternoon and then she'll be

812
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,020
going from Iowa over to New Orleans

813
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,700
and then South Carolina next week.

814
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,810
Essentially she's not going
to let up off the gas.

815
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:16,850
She's gonna go full forward and this is

816
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:19,010
part of the campaign's effort to continue

817
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:21,390
to show the contrast of what Kamala Harris

818
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:23,180
can bring to the campaign trail.

819
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,510
She plans to go full on,

820
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:27,920
they now have 65 staffers
here on the ground in Iowa

821
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,160
and as Mike just mentioned, the debate

822
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,130
was a wake up call for the Biden campaign

823
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:34,840
that he couldn't just stay above the fray

824
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,060
because what last week showed was that

825
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,340
this is going to be a Democratic Primary

826
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:42,490
in which candidates will
show contrast between them.

827
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:45,160
Kamala Harris not only on
issues of race and busing,

828
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:49,050
but also on the Obama
Administration's deportation policies.

829
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:50,940
I want to play for you
a little bit of sound.

830
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:53,580
This was actually from
just over a week ago

831
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:56,400
when Kamala Harris was
over in South Carolina.

832
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,010
I think it's very pertinent to
what we should expect to hear

833
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:02,353
from the California Senator
today and in the weeks ahead.

834
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07,200
- We need somebody who as
President of the United States

835
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,190
understands the need to rebuild the party.

836
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:13,420
Who understands the need
to give the resources

837
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,020
and the support to the people who are

838
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,710
on the ground everyday
doing the hard work.

839
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,580
We can't just helicopter in here.

840
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,240
We have to support the people who are

841
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,503
on the ground, who know the community.

842
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:28,500
- Kamala Harris in that
debate made herself vulnerable

843
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,060
to folks, to voters who
said that they are anxious

844
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,960
about Democrats attacking one another,

845
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,580
but what she did at the same time

846
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,100
and what the polls are indicating

847
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,100
she separated herself as a willingness

848
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:41,220
to paint contrast between her and others

849
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:43,670
and as you just heard from
her there in South Carolina,

850
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:46,120
what we should expect to
hear from her here in Iowa

851
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,300
is that she is maintaining
that she is the candidate

852
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,090
that is looking forward and will outwork

853
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,500
the rest of the field, Craig.

854
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,410
- All right, Vaughn Hilliard
there in Des Moines.

855
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:56,070
Vaughn thank you and Mike
Memoli thank you as well, sir.

856
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:58,170
Will they or won't they?

857
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:02,270
A new tweet from President
Trump just moments ago

858
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:05,600
appears to contradict
his own Administration

859
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,270
on a citizenship question on the census.

860
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:10,690
We're gonna dig into that,
it's a developing story.

861
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:13,250
Also, the newest round of
post-NBC News debate polls

862
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,580
suggested some candidates might

863
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,780
be in more trouble when it comes

864
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,970
to reaching the debate stage this fall.

865
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:20,580
One of those contenders
also hitting the ground

866
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:24,373
in Iowa this week, Congressman
Tim Ryan will join us ahead.

and dryer sheets too.

885

- As a real estate agent, I've learned

00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:16,680
it's excess moisture
that causes musty odors.

887

Pro-tip: use DampRid.

- No matter what I wore,

I worried someone might see
my bladder leak underwear.

909
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:19,310
So I switched to Always Discreet Boutique.

910
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:21,560
It's shape hugging threads
smooth out the back

- What are the three P's?

919
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,860
- The three P's of life insurance

920
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:46,210
on a fixed budget are
price, price and price.

921
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:47,870
A price you can afford,

922

a price that can't increase,

923

- Moments ago President
Trump took to Twitter

949
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:05,890
to say that he will defy
his own Justice Department

950
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:07,490
and the courts on the Census.

951

The President says that the census

952

will have a citizenship question.

953
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:15,990
NBC White House
correspondent Kelly O'Donnell

954
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:18,810
is here to try and clear this up.

955
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:20,890
Hey Kelly O, Justice Department says no,

956
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:22,420
President says yes.

957
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,360
What do we know about what's happening?

958
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,090
- Well it's a little more complicated

959
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:27,980
and what this really gets down to

960
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:30,660
is the president does
not like this decision

961
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,090
and this of course as the president

962
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:36,340
who argues forcefully that
asking those who reply

963
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:40,130
to the 2020 Census if
they are American citizens

964
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:41,750
is an important piece of data,

965
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:44,890
along with all the other
things that a census collects.

966
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:47,290
What we learned late Tuesday, yesterday,

967
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:49,410
was that the Department of Justice

968
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:51,080
and the Department of Commerce

969
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,530
were going forward with printing

970
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:58,350
of the 2020 questionnaire
without the citizenship question.

971
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:00,710
Now is there some gray area here?

972
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:03,240
You can keep a legal challenge going

973
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,450
which the president is arguing for here,

974
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:07,900
and at the same time
take the pragmatic step

975
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,760
of printing the new census
and doing it lawfully

976
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,320
without that citizenship question now

977
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,470
because of the enormity of the task

978
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:18,400
of doing the 2020 Census.

979
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,890
So what we need some clarification on is,

980
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:24,230
is the president directly
defying this plan to print

981
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:27,510
or is he arguing for
continuing the legal case

982
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:30,170
which of course the Supreme
Court had pushed it back

983
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:31,840
to the lower court and said the reasons

984
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,130
given by the Department of Commerce,

985
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:36,690
Secretary Wilbur Ross, were not sufficient

986
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:38,750
to argue for adding this question

987
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:41,020
and it was an open opportunity

988
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:43,520
for the Administration to keep litigating,

989
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,420
but they're running up
against a time deadline

990
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:48,620
because the Constitution,
not just any ordinary law,

991
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:51,590
but the Constitution
requires that a census

992
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:53,050
be taken every 10 years.

993
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,990
So, we're up against that deadline.

994
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:57,130
So is it pragmatism meets politics,

995
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:58,810
is it a frustrated president who's been

996
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:01,890
active on Twitter today pushing back

997
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:03,750
this decision by the Department of Justice

998
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:06,040
and Commerce that we
learned about late yesterday

999
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,820
really followed within 24 hours

1000
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:10,460
of the president arguing pretty forcefully

1001
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,580
that he wanted to keep fighting this

1002
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,650
and so the president has
sort of been pushed back

1003
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:15,810
on his heels with this.

1004
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:17,640
He's calling it fake news.

1005
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,170
We have officials in both
departments who told us

1006
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:22,480
the plan is to go forward
with the printing.

1007
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,900
So is he advocating for
the court case to go on?

1008
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,490
Is this just sort of a political
message from the president,

1009
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:33,040
to our understanding the
census question will not,

1010
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,260
the citizenship question is not

1011
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:38,440
in the new printing that will
be ordered fairly shortly.

1012
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,273
Craig.

1013
00:41:39,273 --> 00:41:40,250
- Kelly O'Donnell from the White House,

1014
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,890
for us, Kelly O, thank you.

1015
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:44,300
I'm joined now by Senior Correspondent

1016
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:48,900
for NPR Boston and MSNBC
Contributor, Kimberly Atkins.

1017
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,860
Also with me, Assistant
Professor of Public Policy

1018
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:55,720
at Harvard University,
Leah Wright Rigueur.

1019
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,340
Thank you ladies both for being with me.

1020
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:00,410
Leah let me start with you,
just your general reaction

1021
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:02,170
to this new tweet on the census.

1022
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:03,190
Apparently the printer's already

1023
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:05,630
been instructed to start the process, so.

1024
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:06,983
What's going on here?

1025
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,800
- So there are a lot of different issues

1026
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,080
that are going on here.

1027
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,310
First we see again that the president

1028
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:15,840
is completely at odds with other factions

1029
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,200
or other agencies or
divisions, departments

1030
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,150
within his own administration.

1031
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:21,670
So it raises the question,

1032
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:24,000
who's in charge here,
who's running the show?

1033
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,330
The other thing too that I think

1034
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:27,460
is important to keep in mind is that

1035
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:28,760
the president is essentially saying,

1036
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,560
and this may be saber rattling,

1037
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,900
it may just be trying to
send a hard political message

1038
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,140
and showing his base
that he means business

1039
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,760
or it may actually be serious,

1040
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,570
but he's essentially saying
I'm gonna go against this

1041
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:41,100
and I'm gonna go against
the court's rulings,

1042
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,760
I'm gonna go against my
own Justice Department

1043
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,510
and I'm going to ensure that that question

1044
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:45,930
finds its way on there.

1045
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:47,130
So in some way, shape, or form,

1046
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:50,059
he is promising to really uphold

1047
00:42:50,059 --> 00:42:55,059
the question about citizenship
and change the census.

1048
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:56,600
Now can he do that?

1049
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,740
It's not exactly clear
how he would do that,

1050
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,560
but he's essentially promising to do that

1051
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,550
and that is cause for concern.

1052
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:05,090
- You know what, Kimberly,
I think for folks

1053
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:06,950
who are watching and who are listening

1054
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:08,070
on Sirius Satellite Radio

1055
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:10,810
who perhaps haven't been
following this story as closely,

1056
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:12,700
maybe we should remind them why is it

1057
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:16,940
that this president finds this
citizenship question itself.

1058
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:19,720
Why does he want this
to be part of the census

1059
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,400
so very badly?

1060
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,770
- Well it's a couple of political reasons

1061
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:24,910
for this, Craig.

1062
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:28,710
One is that when the citizenship question

1063
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:31,190
is on the census there is research

1064
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:33,170
that would say that it would actually work

1065
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:37,520
to suppress participation in the census

1066
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,310
and get an under count,

1067
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:42,670
particularly not just of
people who are immigrants,

1068
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:46,310
but even citizens who
are related to immigrants

1069
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:49,420
have folks who are of
mixed immigration status

1070
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,690
within their household.

1071
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:53,160
There will be a fear that
participating in this census

1072
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:57,210
could somehow flag them or
get them in sort of trouble.

1073
00:43:57,210 --> 00:43:59,330
We have seen through documentation

1074
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:01,940
throughout the litigation over this census

1075
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,510
that there are some folks who know

1076
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:06,370
that that would hurt
Democrats in an election.

1077
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:08,180
I mean the census decides a lot of things

1078
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:10,640
from Congressional districts
to federal funding,

1079
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,010
but it will have an
impact on the election.

1080
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:16,610
Could depress turn out
and depress the strength

1081
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:18,920
of Democratic districts.

1082
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:21,080
So there's a political incentive here.

1083
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,380
I've talked to state
officials who have said

1084
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:26,900
even with the census
question not on the census,

1085
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:29,560
there has been so much discussion,

1086
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,970
so much divisiveness over this issue

1087
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:34,890
that they are still fearing

1088
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:36,660
that there will be an under count

1089
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:39,210
and that will be
problematic for these states

1090
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:42,230
who depend on the census
for their federal funding.

1091
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:44,089
- Also in the news today, of course,

1092
00:44:44,089 --> 00:44:47,270
these troubling images that we are getting

1093
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:48,896
thanks to that Watchdog group

1094
00:44:48,896 --> 00:44:50,900
of the migrant detention centers

1095
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:53,060
from inside these migrant
detention centers.

1096
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:55,140
I asked presidential hopeful Jay Inslee

1097
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:59,390
just a few moments ago about
his plan for immigration

1098
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:02,120
and we also talked about
President Trump's strategy

1099
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,140
on immigration.

1100
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:04,990
Leah, Kimberly, this is what he said.

1101
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:08,880
- He has made it very clear that he wants

1102
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,130
to make people afraid and he likes

1103
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:14,530
these inhumane conditions because it is

1104
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:18,660
part of his intention to
fan the flame of discord

1105
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:21,710
around immigration and
instead of uniting us

1106
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:24,350
to find a comprehensive solution,

1107
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:27,130
instead of trying to
address the root causes

1108
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:29,960
of this immigration problem to keep people

1109
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,770
where they live and not
force them to come north,

1110
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:36,840
he has decided to utilize
inhumane conditions

1111
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:40,230
as a tool of his gross cruelty.

1112
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:42,760
- Leah, is what we're seeing,

1113
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,710
is it the president's strategy,

1114
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:48,463
or is the result of a failed strategy?

1115
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:54,510
- So, the answer is yes to both.

1116
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:56,680
I think one of the things that

1117
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,900
has emerged and has emerged
over the past couple of years

1118
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,330
is that the Trump Administration

1119
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:03,930
has been very, very direct in some ways,

1120
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:05,870
in some ways not so direct,

1121
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:07,190
but has been pretty direct about saying

1122
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:09,040
that their separation policies,

1123
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,550
their policies around the border,

1124
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:13,170
these policies about detention
centers have been designed

1125
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:15,770
to dissuade people from
coming to the border.

1126
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:17,440
It has not been successful

1127
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,980
and because it has not been successful,

1128
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:23,490
we have seen an explosion
in kind of these centers,

1129
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:26,990
these areas and then kind
of very poor conditions

1130
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:29,060
and we've seen the Administration arguing

1131
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:31,200
in favor of poor conditions.

1132
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,320
Now the bigger thing I think
and this is going to be

1133
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,700
a question for many of
the Democratic candidates

1134
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:39,830
moving into primary debates
and into the general election

1135
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:41,560
is well what are you gonna do about it?

1136
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,340
What are we going to do to fix it?

1137
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:45,070
What is the actual policy agenda

1138
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:46,860
both on immigration, on refugee sedum,

1139
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:49,370
on asylum seekers and then the conditions

1140
00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:50,930
that these people are facing

1141
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:53,210
because right now this is unsustainable

1142
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:55,540
and as a political strategy
perhaps it's working

1143
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:57,370
for President Trump's supporters,

1144
00:46:57,370 --> 00:46:58,330
but for the rest of the country

1145
00:46:58,330 --> 00:46:59,774
it absolutely is not working.

1146
00:46:59,774 --> 00:47:03,470
- Kimberly, let's talk
politics for just a second here

1147
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:07,850
and Mayor Pete specifically,
we were just talking

1148
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:10,040
about his fundraising numbers
during our last segment.

1149
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,670
Bernie Sanders as well
put up about 24 million,

1150
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:15,210
actually Bernie Sanders
transferred about six million.

1151
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:16,240
He raised roughly 18,

1152
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:20,210
but Mayor Pete raised
close to $25 million.

1153
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:23,140
That's pretty impressive
for a second quarter,

1154
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:25,020
but you look at his polling

1155
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:29,340
and the two don't seem to make sense.

1156
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:31,250
Why is he not polling better

1157
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:34,330
if he is raising so much money?

1158
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:38,150
- Well a few reasons, I've
been talking to people

1159
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:40,590
who are raising money for Mayor Pete

1160
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:43,280
as he travels to places
including Massachusetts

1161
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,350
this upcoming weekend and they say

1162
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:47,909
that on the ground he is
resonating with folks,

1163
00:47:47,909 --> 00:47:49,610
they're doing a combination of

1164
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:52,210
these big dollar fundraisers that

1165
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:54,660
folks like Elizabeth
Warren and Bernie Sanders

1166
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:56,890
have chosen not to do, but also doing

1167
00:47:56,890 --> 00:48:00,360
the smaller dollar donations in order

1168
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:03,340
to energize younger people, really allow

1169
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:05,730
people to get to know him and it has been

1170
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:07,280
literally paying off.

1171
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,210
Now one thing that
raising this money will do

1172
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:11,980
will allow him to stay in the race longer

1173
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:13,490
than some of the other candidates

1174
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:15,450
and give him more of an opportunity

1175
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:18,220
to build his profile, get out with ads,

1176
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:19,570
and raise his profile.

1177
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:20,940
I think a lot of people just don't know

1178
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:23,050
who he is or what he's about yet

1179
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:25,420
and that could happen,
but on the other hand

1180
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:28,200
he's had a particularly
difficult time resonating

1181
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,270
with voters of color.

1182
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:30,470
We know that for Democrats,

1183
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:32,560
that is a crucial, crucial block.

1184
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,010
He had the issue with the police shooting

1185
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:38,200
in South Bend and so that is a big,

1186
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,610
that's a big obstacle that he's going

1187
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:42,830
to have to overcome, but at least for now

1188
00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:44,500
he has the funds to stay in it.

1189
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,450
- Kimberly Atkins, Leah Wright Rigor,

1190

back those voters that swung to Trump.

1195
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,460
Now, Congressman Tim Ryan sounding off

1196
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:58,480
on the effect that the immigration debate

1197
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,410
could have on the race.

1250
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,880
- It's so important to us that Verizon

1251
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,450
is supporting military families.

1252
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:45,810
When I have a child deployed

1253
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:47,990
having a reliable
network means everything.

1254

it's the best thing in the world

1256

one of these gray hairs.

00:52:20,703 --> 00:52:22,770
(bell dings)
(crowd cheers)

1270
00:52:22,770 --> 00:52:23,920
So maybe it's time to unthink

1271
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,600
what you think you think
about premium fuel.

1272
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:28,860
Shell V-Power NiTRO+ Premium Gasoline

1273
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:32,190
It's fuel for thought.

1274
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,320
- [Lester] Good evening,
everyone, breaking news tonight.

1275
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,153
- [Announcer] Lester Holt.

1276
00:52:38,153 --> 00:52:39,600
- [Lester] It sounds like
a jet airplane up there,

1277
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:40,930
but that is fire.

1278
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:43,750
- [Announcer] The most trusted
TV news anchor in America.

1279
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:45,610
- [Lester] That's Nightly
News, I'm Lester Holt.

1280
00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:47,750
- [Announcer] More
America's watch NBC News

1281
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:50,547
than any other news
organization in the world.

1282
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,550
- Democrats are focused on making

1283
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:56,850
the overcrowded and dangerous conditions

1284
00:52:56,850 --> 00:52:59,410
revealed in these migrant
detention facilities

1285
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:01,450
a national focal point.

1286
00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:03,980
I'm joined now by Ohio
Democratic Congressman

1287
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,430
and presidential candidate, Tim Ryan.

1288
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:08,790
Congressman, we have all
seen these pictures now

1289
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:11,410
and we've heard some of
the heartbreaking stories

1290
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:15,000
of the conditions from these
migrant detention facilities.

1291
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,600
A number of the other candidates

1292
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,540
have visited and released
some detailed plans

1293
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:21,360
on how to deal with them.

1294
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,630
I don't believe you've
done either just yet.

1295
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:25,130
What would you do?

1296
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:27,830
What would you do with
these detention facilities,

1297
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:30,840
specifically facilities
that are privately operated?

1298
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:31,673
Go ahead.

1299
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,007
- Yeah, we should not be
locking these people up

1300
00:53:36,007 --> 00:53:39,940
and the way we're doing
it, Craig, is atrocious.

1301
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:42,110
I think it goes against our values.

1302
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:43,400
I think we need to make sure,

1303
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:46,460
I wish the president would
ask doctors and nurses

1304
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:48,070
to go immediately to the border

1305
00:53:48,070 --> 00:53:51,030
and start helping administer some care

1306
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:51,940
to these people.

1307
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:53,430
Jamming them in these facilities,

1308
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:55,810
I mean this is this stunning to think

1309
00:53:55,810 --> 00:53:57,700
that this is the United States of America

1310
00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:01,010
and it's contributing
to the level of anxiety

1311
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:03,430
that we have across our
society today, Craig.

1312
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:05,490
I mean, everyone's telling us things

1313
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:06,430
are going really good,

1314
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:08,510
but yet everybody feels really bad

1315
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:13,450
and this anxiety that just
watching these things happen,

1316
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:15,330
let alone if you're in anyway connected

1317
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:16,810
to these people that are down there

1318
00:54:16,810 --> 00:54:19,670
is just heartbreaking and
we're the United States,

1319
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:21,350
we should be able to go
down there and fix this

1320
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:22,660
and it shouldn't take that long.

1321
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:25,690
- What would you do on day one if elected?

1322
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:26,923
About this specifically?

1323
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:31,513
- Well make sure everybody coming in

1324
00:54:31,513 --> 00:54:34,160
through these facilities is taken care of,

1325
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,730
but the key's gonna be
to go to Central America

1326
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:39,260
and actually stabilize those countries

1327
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:41,110
where people are migrating from.

1328
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:43,990
The president is the Distractor in Chief.

1329
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:46,890
He can't focus for more than five seconds.

1330
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:48,670
The issue is in Central America.

1331
00:54:48,670 --> 00:54:50,610
I've been saying this now for months.

1332
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:52,010
We need to go to Central America,

1333
00:54:52,010 --> 00:54:54,860
stabilize those countries,
kick the gangs out.

1334
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:57,760
We don't even have an
Ambassador in Honduras right now

1335
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,907
so we can't be engaged
in the way we want to be

1336
00:54:59,907 --> 00:55:02,590
and the president is cutting
the State Department funding

1337
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:05,440
that would help us repair
what's happening down there,

1338
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,890
that's the heart of the problem,

1339
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:08,700
that's where people are coming from

1340
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:10,960
and if we want to end
the crisis at the border

1341
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,810
we need to go deal with
heart of the matter

1342
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:14,180
in Central America.

1343
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:15,240
- Like a number of the candidates

1344
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:18,220
over the holiday weekend
here, you are in Iowa,

1345
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:19,230
you're in Iowa right now,

1346
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:20,330
Waterloo.
- Yeah.

1347
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:23,360
- There is a new Suffolk
University USA Today poll

1348
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:26,560
of Iowa voters from after
NBC's debate last week.

1349
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:29,670
This poll just out, USA
Today put it this way.

1350
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:32,210
Three of those who
participated in the debates,

1351
00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:34,210
New York Mayor Bill de Blasio,

1352
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:35,860
Ohio Representative Tim Ryan,

1353
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:38,460
and California
Representative Eric Swalwell

1354
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:41,280
failed to attract a single supporter

1355
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,550
in the Iowa survey.

1356
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:47,550
That's of 500 people in Iowa
who were surveyed, Congressman.

1357
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:50,123
Do you have what it takes
to stay in this race?

1358
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:53,170
- No doubt about it.

1359
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:55,500
I mean literally our
phone has been ringing

1360
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,040
off the hook since the debate.

1361
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,760
We've got a lot of
people that we're leaning

1362
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:02,170
to Vice President Biden
who were calling us

1363
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:05,080
and they want to meet primarily
from the early states.

1364
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:06,940
We've had some of the
best fundraising days

1365
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:09,110
we've had since the debate.

1366
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:10,160
So I think we connected.

1367
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:13,350
I mean clearly the national conversation

1368
00:56:13,350 --> 00:56:15,170
was around something different and I think

1369
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:17,800
these polls at this point
are absolutely meaningless.

1370
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,590
I mean, you can go back
and look at winners

1371
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:20,910
from the last 40 years

1372
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:23,570
and at some point they were where I am now

1373
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:25,020
and I think we've got the message.

1374
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:27,670
We're connecting with
people around the stress

1375
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:30,300
and anxiety and fear that's facing them

1376
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:32,090
whether it's the economic anxiety,

1377
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:33,710
whether it's around healthcare,

1378
00:56:33,710 --> 00:56:35,100
whether it's around what we're watching

1379
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,140
happen at the border,
whether it's what's happening

1380
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:39,570
to our environment and our soil

1381
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:42,240
and the things that are
happening environmentally.

1382
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,240
We're connecting with people, Craig,

1383
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,370
and people are, you
know, I'm asking people

1384
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:48,510
to come to TimRyanforAmerica.com,

1385
00:56:48,510 --> 00:56:49,970
be a part of this campaign.

1386
00:56:49,970 --> 00:56:52,500
We just released the most comprehensive

1387
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,860
transformational education agenda

1388
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:57,580
to help with trauma-based
care for our kids

1389
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:58,790
and social and emotional learning

1390
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:01,330
in our schools and wraparound therapy,

1391
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:04,380
so we are taking care of the big issues

1392
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:07,300
in my campaign and that's why
people are getting on board.

1393
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:08,830
- You just mentioned fundraising.

1394
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:11,180
How much have you raised
in the second quarter?

1395
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:15,050
- Well we don't have, I don't
have the numbers right now,

1396
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:16,180
but I will tell you--
- Ballpark it.

1397
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:19,860
- Our best days were
right after the debate

1398
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:21,760
and I was really excited about that

1399
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:24,210
and we've done really well into July

1400
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:26,751
so we're moving in the right direction.

1401
00:57:26,751 --> 00:57:28,000
I mean I didn't get in till April.

1402
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,650
- 24 million?
- So.

1403
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:30,650
We're moving in the right direction.

1404
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:32,370
I'm really pleased with it.

1405
00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:34,870
- Mayor Pete's at about
24, almost 25 million.

1406
00:57:34,870 --> 00:57:38,707
Bernie Sanders put out his
numbers yesterday at 24 million.

1407
00:57:38,707 --> 00:57:40,503
Are we in that neighborhood?

1408
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,030
- We are not in that neighborhood.

1409
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:45,950
I mean here's the deal, Craig.

1410
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:47,490
I'm from Northeast Ohio.

1411
00:57:47,490 --> 00:57:49,740
I'm not from a big city.

1412
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:51,570
I'm not from a big state.

1413
00:57:51,570 --> 00:57:53,840
I don't have an Ivy League education

1414
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:56,340
or network that I can tap into.

1415
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:58,010
So, we're you know doing it the way

1416
00:57:58,010 --> 00:58:01,030
the way it has to be done
and that's grassroots,

1417
00:58:01,030 --> 00:58:02,580
building this thing brick by brick,

1418
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:04,300
but we're moving in the right direction.

1419
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:05,620
We got people excited.

1420
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:09,160
We just started a whole
Teacher's for Tim initiative

1421
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,490
around teacher's who are coming on board.

1422
00:58:11,490 --> 00:58:12,620
So we're building this thing out.

1423
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:14,790
I mean it's important
to remember it's July,

1424
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:16,370
Bill Clinton didn't get in this race

1425
00:58:16,370 --> 00:58:18,850
when he ran in '92 till October.

1426
00:58:18,850 --> 00:58:20,730
So we are way ahead of the game here

1427
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:22,090
compared to past years.

1428
00:58:22,090 --> 00:58:24,480
- Congressman, thank you
and enjoy the Fourth.

1429
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:25,740
Thank you very much.

1430
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:26,690
Ahead in the next hour,

1431
00:58:26,690 --> 00:58:28,390
my colleague Andrea
Mitchell's gonna have more

1432
00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:30,110
on the controversy
surrounding the president's

1433
00:58:30,110 --> 00:58:31,860
planned Fourth of July event.

1434
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:34,707
D.C.'s Mayor, Muriel Bowser will join her.

1435
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:41,880
- Budget meeting!

1436
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:42,790
- Sweet.

1437
00:58:42,790 --> 00:58:44,680
- When you compare last
quarter to this quarter.

1438
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:45,710
- [Announcer] It's no wonder everything

1439
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:48,030
seems a little better with
the creamy taste of Philly,

1440
00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:50,030
made with fresh milk and real cream.

1441
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:51,510
It must be the Philly.

1442
00:58:51,510 --> 00:58:52,610
- When you book at Hilton.com

1443
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:53,930
you get the price match guarantee.

1444
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:55,850
So if you find your room at a lower rate,

00:58:55,850 --> 00:58:58,200
Hilton is like we're gonna match that rate

1446
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,540
and give you an extra 25% off.

1447
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:02,080
- What would travel sites do
if you found a different price?

1448
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,680
- That's not my problem it's your problem.

1449
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:04,680
Book at hilton.com.

1450
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:05,830

1451
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:07,160
with that credit card?

1452
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:08,460
Turn to the nerds.

1453

Oops! (laughs)

1459
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:20,940
- Oh, wrong move.

1460
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:22,870
Old fashioned bandages get dirty.

1461
00:59:22,870 --> 00:59:24,380
They can let in water and germs.

1462
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:26,060
Look, it's falling off.

1463
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:28,550
New-Skin is the flexible liquid bandage

1464
00:59:28,550 --> 00:59:30,410
that seals out the bad stuff.

1465
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:31,880
There's a spray too.

1466
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:34,420
- [Announcer] New-Skin,
re-think how you heal.

1467

1476

1477

- [Announcer] Paying too
much for your prescriptions.

1481
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:08,360
- Isn't this a situation of hate the game

1482
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:10,280
not the player?
- This is a power play.

1483
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:12,330
This is a strategic move from her right?

1484
01:00:12,330 --> 01:00:14,590
- Why is this potentially such a big deal?

1485
01:00:14,590 --> 01:00:15,770
- We have more breaking news.

1486
01:00:15,770 --> 01:00:16,603
Why wouldn't we?

1487
01:00:16,603 --> 01:00:17,660
It's Tuesday in Washington.

1488
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:20,193
- The wall is the sticking
point, not border.
