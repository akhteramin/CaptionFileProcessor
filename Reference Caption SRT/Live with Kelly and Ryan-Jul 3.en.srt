00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,870
It's a big one.

29
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:26,931
I'm not gonna blow

30
00:01:26,931 --> 00:01:27,764
up your age.
- Does he have a

31
00:01:27,764 --> 00:01:28,860
traditional celebration?

32
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,693
- Well, you know,

33
00:01:29,693 --> 00:01:32,410
every year, he likes to
say that they do fireworks,

34
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:34,010
and they have a big cookout.
- For his birthday.

35
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,670
- But I'm like, that's
pretty much everybody.

36
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,290
- You know, that was for me.
- Yeah.

37
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,920
- That was for me, that
whole thing up in the sky.

38
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,410
Well, my greatest memory of your father

39
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:41,820
is he and I laying on a chaise lounge,

40
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:42,960
in The Bahamas together,

41
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,880
with him giving me life
advice and guidance,

42
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,020
and asking if I wanted
representation, by him,

43
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,649
to negotiate my next deal.

44
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:50,850
(audience laughing)

45
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,778
He was gonna be my union member.

46
00:01:52,778 --> 00:01:54,470
- It was the sweet, (stammers)--

47
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:55,528
- [Gelman] He was trying to unionize you.

48
00:01:55,528 --> 00:01:56,361
- He was (stammers)

49
00:01:56,361 --> 00:01:57,194
unionize us.
- Yeah.

50
00:01:57,194 --> 00:01:58,530
- He was telling us that
we needed to unionize.

51
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,120
And I said, We are in a union, Dad.

52
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,100
Believe it or not, we are in a union.

53
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,890
- I felt like he accepted
me in that moment.

54
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:05,723
- He really did.

55
00:02:05,723 --> 00:02:06,763
The two of you were--
- Right. (laughs)

56
00:02:06,763 --> 00:02:08,090
- I have pictures of that,

57
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,430
and they're some of my favorite memories.

58
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,393
Because, you two are so funny together.

59
00:02:11,393 --> 00:02:12,226
The two of you,
- It was--

60
00:02:12,226 --> 00:02:17,226
- Because, you take on
my dad's personality

61
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,267
when you talk to my dad.
(audience laughs)

62
00:02:21,267 --> 00:02:23,490
- I became...
- Yeah.

63
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,183
- I became stern.
- Yeah.

64
00:02:25,183 --> 00:02:26,016
- I became...

65
00:02:26,016 --> 00:02:27,186
My voice got deeper.
- Yeah.

66
00:02:27,186 --> 00:02:29,417
(audience laughs)

67
00:02:29,417 --> 00:02:30,250
- I find when I talk to athletes, too,

68
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,470
I do the same thing.
- Right.

69
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,377
- Like I, "So how was the game?"

70
00:02:33,377 --> 00:02:35,723
- Yeah.
(audience laughs)

71
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:36,556
And you always say to my dad,

72
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:37,790
"Joe Ripa."
- Joe Ripa.

73
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,310
- Yeah, it's like you puff up,

74
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,560
and then you call him both names--

75
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,740
- Joe Ripa.
- Which most people do.

76
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,100
Most people call me both names.

77
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,246
- Kelly Ripa.

78
00:02:46,246 --> 00:02:47,565
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well, it's like one.

79
00:02:47,565 --> 00:02:48,445
I mean, come on,

80
00:02:48,445 --> 00:02:49,278
Kelly Ripa.
- It's one name.

81
00:02:49,278 --> 00:02:50,677
- There's Kelly Ripa.

82
00:02:50,677 --> 00:02:51,510
There's Kelly Ripa.

83
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,343
Kelly Ripa through the park.

84
00:02:52,343 --> 00:02:53,236
- But, I mean, before this show,

85
00:02:53,236 --> 00:02:54,069
I'm going back to high school.

86
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:55,606
- Keripa?
- I was both names.

87
00:02:55,606 --> 00:02:57,197
- Keripa?
- Well--

88
00:02:57,197 --> 00:02:59,550
- Keripa.
(audience laughs)

89
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,670
Listen, if you're--
- You're making me more

90
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,765
of a sound than... (laughs)

91
00:03:03,765 --> 00:03:05,106
- (laughs) Well, happy
Fourth of July, Keripa.

92
00:03:05,106 --> 00:03:05,939
- Thank you.

93
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:07,250
- I was reading this about, you know,

94
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,540
thank you for tuning in in the morning.

95
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,800
I don't know what your
morning routines are,

96
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,890
your morning habits are,

97
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,107
but there's a whole article on

98
00:03:12,107 --> 00:03:16,480
surprising morning habits that
can give you more anxiety.

99
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,640
And, just by reading it,

100
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,473
I got more anxiety.
- Right, of course.

101
00:03:18,473 --> 00:03:19,623
(audience laughs)

102
00:03:19,623 --> 00:03:20,456
You saying the word anxiety
- Gives you--

103
00:03:20,456 --> 00:03:23,880
- Gave me anxiety.

104
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,750
- Cortisols releasing right now,

105
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,162
isn't it?
Right now, yeah.

106
00:03:26,162 --> 00:03:26,995
- Is cortisol releasing into your system?

107
00:03:26,995 --> 00:03:28,033
- Yeah.

108
00:03:28,033 --> 00:03:28,866
- Well let it out.
- That's why I stopped wearing

109
00:03:28,866 --> 00:03:30,212
pants with a zipper.

110
00:03:30,212 --> 00:03:31,400
(audience laughs)

111
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,437
Yeah, can't do it.

112
00:03:32,437 --> 00:03:33,490
- That's the reason?

113
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:34,773
- That's the reason.

114
00:03:34,773 --> 00:03:35,606
- Oh!
- I can't do it.

115
00:03:35,606 --> 00:03:36,439
I can't work in live TV,

116
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:39,210
and have a waistband.
(laughing)

117
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,230
No waist anymore.

118
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,160
I'm like, forget it.

119
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,200
The cortisol spikes,

120
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,240
it's not gonna affect me
- Well, listen--

121
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,263
- 'Cause my dress is just gonna widen.

122
00:03:47,205 --> 00:03:48,038
- Do you jump--

123
00:03:48,038 --> 00:03:49,870
They say it's bad for you
to jump right outta bed.

124
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,440
Like to get right outta bed is bad.

125
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,104
It causes a spike in all of that.

126
00:03:54,104 --> 00:03:54,937
- Well.
- Do you jump right out?

127
00:03:54,937 --> 00:03:55,770
Or do you lay there for,

128
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,274
I lay there and moan for a minute.

129
00:03:57,274 --> 00:03:58,110
(audience laughs)

130
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,910
- I usually set snooze.

131
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,360
I do one snooze, but--

132
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,700
- I find it to be painful.

133
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,820
- The snooze?
- Yeah.

134
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,948
'Cause I know it's coming
and I can't, you know,

135
00:04:05,948 --> 00:04:08,627
it's like that anxiety?
- Yeah, but I like that.

136
00:04:08,627 --> 00:04:09,617
It's like (stammers) I hit snooze,

137
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:11,610
but the whole time,

138
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,810
I'm quasi-awake,

139
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,200
and knowing that--
- It's coming?

140
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,530
But see, that gives me anxiety,

141
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:16,363
knowing it's coming.

142
00:04:16,363 --> 00:04:18,693
- I just burped, and that gave me anxiety.

143
00:04:18,693 --> 00:04:19,526
- By the way...
(audience laughs)

144
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:21,723
Can I say, that garlic smells great.

145
00:04:22,676 --> 00:04:23,509
- Oh, no, it's not.

146
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:24,875
It's not garlic.
- No, I know.

147
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,260
(laughs) I know it's not garlic.

148
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,268
Doing household chores...

149
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,860
Gives you anxiety, so quit.

150
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,060
- Wait, that gives you anxiety?

151
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:32,893
Household chores?

152
00:04:32,893 --> 00:04:34,464
- Yeah.

153
00:04:34,464 --> 00:04:35,297
- Knowing you have--
- At the start of your day,

154
00:04:35,297 --> 00:04:36,130
at the start of,

155
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:36,963
this is all at the beginning

156
00:04:36,963 --> 00:04:37,796
of the day.
- Oh, they're saying don't do

157
00:04:37,796 --> 00:04:38,629
it at the start of the day.
- Yeah, don't do it at the

158
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:39,462
beginning of the day.

159
00:04:39,462 --> 00:04:40,800
Don't look at your work email
the second you get outta bed.

160
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,150
Don't look at your to-do list.

161
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,293
Don't skip breakfast.

162
00:04:44,253 --> 00:04:47,065
- I mean, I do all of that.
- I know, right?

163
00:04:47,065 --> 00:04:47,898
- I do every--
- But, you get to

164
00:04:47,898 --> 00:04:49,200
wear a dress, and it's all fine.

165
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,496
- Well, I mean,

166
00:04:50,496 --> 00:04:51,329
they make it look fine
- There's no waist band.

167
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:53,613
- I liken myself to a
Westminster show dog.

168
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:57,370
Yeah, it looks very fluffy on the outside.

169
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,203
But, on the inside,

170
00:04:58,203 --> 00:04:59,144
it's like, is this done yet?

171
00:04:59,144 --> 00:04:59,977
(laughing)

172
00:04:59,977 --> 00:05:00,966
Can we just...

173
00:05:00,966 --> 00:05:04,080
Can you please put me back in my cage?

174
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,300
I just wanna...

175
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,900
I don't wanna stand before
the judges right now.

176
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,330
- I do find looking at the phone,

177
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,960
I try not to do it first thing.

178
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,900
Which is hard sometimes,

179
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,537
because you're turning off your alarm,

180
00:05:14,537 --> 00:05:15,370
and then all this

181
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:16,203
stuff is there.
- I have to look at it,

182
00:05:16,203 --> 00:05:17,480
because usually he's either texted me,

183
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,537
or you've texted me over
some thing that's happened

184
00:05:20,537 --> 00:05:21,800
in the middle of the night.

185
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,272
- Some inane thing.
- Yeah, some thing

186
00:05:23,272 --> 00:05:24,335
that has happened.

187
00:05:24,335 --> 00:05:25,650
- That's true.
- So I have to check it

188
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,000
first thing in the morning.

189
00:05:27,859 --> 00:05:30,540
You know, it's not just my
dad's birthday today, okay?

190
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:34,200
I want you to know it's also
another national holiday.

191
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,033
- What is that?
- A special day.

192
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:37,880
- And, I believe it could
become an international holiday,

193
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,700
if we get it trending here.

194
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:43,160
It is National Compliment Your Mirror Day.

195
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,962
- [Gelman] Oh, my goodness!

196
00:05:44,962 --> 00:05:45,795
- Yes.

197
00:05:47,027 --> 00:05:48,213
Yes.

198
00:05:48,213 --> 00:05:50,540
(laughing)
(applause)

199
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,630
Lady in the front row's like,

200
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,830
no, it is not.

201
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,480
Oh, yes, it is.

202
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,500
You wanna know how it works?

203
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,618
Watch this.
- Okay.

204
00:05:57,618 --> 00:05:59,520
- Kay, you hold this.
- I'm not complimenting

205
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,630
a picture of me.
- You hold it.

206
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,250
- Here.
- Gelman, you wanna do it too?

207
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,440
And, I'll read?

208
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,360
- Sure, I can do it, yeah.
- Yes.

209
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,400
You stand next to Ryan.

210
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,030
I wanna see who does--
- Gelman celebrates

211
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:08,863
this every day.

212
00:06:08,863 --> 00:06:10,180
- Oh, I know!

213
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,600
Trust me, I know.
- Yeah, yeah.

214
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,830
- Here's what you do, everybody.

215
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,260
Stand in front of your mirror
- Oh God.

216
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,700
- With your eyes closed.

217
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,240
That's the key.
- That's the key.

218
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,200
Close your eyes.

219
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,257
- Turns the lights off.
- Yeah.

220
00:06:21,257 --> 00:06:22,090
(clears throat)

221
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,300
Put a big smile on your face.

222
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,170
Eyes closed, big smile.

223
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:29,910
Now, open your eyes.

224
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,036
- No!
(audience laughs)

225
00:06:32,036 --> 00:06:33,156
I don't wanna see it, no.

226
00:06:33,156 --> 00:06:34,310
- Wow, isn't the picture of the person

227
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,550
in the mirror absolutely stunning?

228
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:40,620
- Oh, yes!
(audience laughs)

229
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,720
- Who's making love to themself over here?

230
00:06:44,609 --> 00:06:45,927
What is going on?

231
00:06:45,927 --> 00:06:49,270
- Don't let this special
holiday be overshadowed

232
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,710
by the 4th of July.
- No!

233
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,543
I'm feeling very positive.

234
00:06:52,543 --> 00:06:53,450
- I have to tell you, I actually--

235
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,050
- Make sure you compliment your mirror

236
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,179
for displaying the beautiful person...

237
00:06:57,179 --> 00:06:59,190
- Oh, God.
- Thank you, mirror!

238
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,479
What a great mirror you are!

239
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,800
(laughing)

240
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,610
- Gag, gag, gag.
- You're my favorite mirror.

241
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,453
You're a good mirror.
- Okay, Gelman.

242
00:07:07,453 --> 00:07:08,480
- All right, goodbye.

243
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,847
- Thank you, Gelman.

244
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:12,610
(audience applauding and cheering)

245
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:15,920
- I was reading this article
about smartphones at the gym.

246
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,800
I guess, if you go to
the gym and work out,

247
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,000
the gyms want you to post

248
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,990
that you're working out at the gym.

249
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:22,930
Because, they get good free
publicity, and marketing.

250
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:25,520
- Well, especially your gym
where all the models go.

251
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,600
- Woo!
- (laughs) Yeah.

252
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,490
- That's why--
- It looks like a

253
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,985
Victoria Secret shoot every time.

254
00:07:29,985 --> 00:07:31,830
I'm like, oh, there's Ryan

255
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,690
at his gym again.

256
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:35,620
- Hey, look, it's the only gym

257
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,750
that has enough weight for me.

258
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,774
- [Gelman] Oh, woo!

259
00:07:37,774 --> 00:07:40,024
(laughing)

260
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,438
Three pounders?

261
00:07:42,438 --> 00:07:44,291
- Yeah, I have the little
pink ones you hold.

262
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:47,002
(audience laughing)

263
00:07:47,002 --> 00:07:48,300
- Do they make sounds?

264
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,530
- Yeah, they make shaker sounds.

265
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:50,840
- They make sounds.

266
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,190
- To some Daddy Yankee music.
- Ooh wee

267
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,850
- But this article is about gym etiquette.

268
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,070
They say, don't Face-time or
Skype in front of other people.

269
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,100
No photos in the locker room.

270
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,300
- Oh, yeah, naw.
- No.

271
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,370
(laughing)

272
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,620
Wait until after a class

273
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,500
to ask the instructor for the selfie.

274
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,770
Now, what I find...

275
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,770
People do in the gym,

276
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,727
is they take their phone,
- Yeah.

277
00:08:11,727 --> 00:08:13,710
- And they set it up over here,

278
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:14,543
you know?
- Yeah.

279
00:08:14,543 --> 00:08:15,376
And, they record.
- Then, they go over

280
00:08:15,376 --> 00:08:16,428
here to do curls,
- Right.

281
00:08:16,428 --> 00:08:18,327
- And then, you walk through
their shot and (scoffs).

282
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:20,751
- Yeah, well, guess what?
- I mean, what?

283
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:21,584
- Guess what?

284
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,289
That's exactly their problem,

285
00:08:23,289 --> 00:08:24,420
not your problem.
- Yeah, exactly.

286
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,510
- Because that is a, (stammers) the floor,

287
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:30,010
this is gonna sound like a
shock to all the millennials,

288
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,446
the floor is for a walking.

289
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:33,850
(audience laughs)

290
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:36,260
- Well, the good--
- It's not an imaginary tripod

291
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,350
for you to lean your cellphone,

292
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,490
so you can have a selfie,

293
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,200
so you can remember,

294
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,809
so you can be nostalgic in real time.

295
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:44,800
(audience laughs)

296
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,510
Right?
- Listen, these are the people

297
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,110
that are celebrating the
mirror day all day today.

298
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,169
So, they won't be at the gym.

299
00:08:49,169 --> 00:08:50,470
- That's right.
(audience laughs)

300
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,303
That's right, they're taking a

301
00:08:51,303 --> 00:08:52,150
day off today.
- They're taking the day off

302
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,860
to just celebrate themselves, again.

303
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,147
- Yes, that is true.

304
00:08:55,147 --> 00:08:56,570
- Shall we, are we?

305
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:57,450
- Sure, we could do that.

306
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,788
I mean, I do have my study on insomnia.

307
00:08:59,788 --> 00:09:00,800
- [Gelman] Oh!

308
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,633
- Do it.

309
00:09:01,633 --> 00:09:03,200
- You wanna know why we're so,

310
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,092
why we're such insomniacs?

311
00:09:05,092 --> 00:09:06,030
- Why are we such insomniacs?

312
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,262
- Embarrassing thoughts
keep us awake at night.

313
00:09:08,262 --> 00:09:09,610
(laughing)

314
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:10,470
- I think just thoughts.

315
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,270
Like a sum of all thoughts

316
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,623
keep me awake.
- Well, that's what I said.

317
00:09:13,623 --> 00:09:14,770
- Like everything happens.
- I was like thoughts

318
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:15,630
keep me awake at night.

319
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,480
Not necessarily embarrassing

320
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,850
thoughts because--
- Just like a flow.

321
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,640
- I am a human experiment,

322
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,980
that you cannot die from embarrassment.

323
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,160
- You are, that's correct.

324
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,740
- I'm still here, right.
- You are good on that.

325
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,880
- But...

326
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,830
They are saying that like,

327
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:36,290
daily blunders can creep into
the margins of our brain.

328
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:38,590
And so, we fall asleep,

329
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:42,300
but suddenly, the thought
of something mortifying

330
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,480
that happened during the day creeps in.

331
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,510
- It does.

332
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,343
- Right.

333
00:09:46,343 --> 00:09:48,940
- It does but there's 40
other thoughts happening

334
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,040
at the same time.
- Right.

335
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,050
- So one by one, shh,

336
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,310
I try and quiet them.
- Right.

337
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,143
- Shh, then the alarm goes off.

338
00:09:55,143 --> 00:09:56,878
It's morning (murmurs).

339
00:09:56,878 --> 00:09:58,100
I'm still trying to quiet them.

340
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,190
- You're trying to quiet that?

341
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,023
- I'm trying to quiet.
- Yeah.

342
00:10:00,023 --> 00:10:01,750
- You know, I mean, I
try to quiet the thought.

343
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,920
It's hard to do sometimes.

344
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,140
- I always worry that I've
hurt somebody's feelings

345
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:09,330
and that creeps back to me, you know?

346
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,470
You know my sense of humor.

347
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,310
Sometimes I'll...
- Yeah.

348
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,890
- I'll use some of my best stuff

349
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,615
on people I don't know that well,

350
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,316
and they're like.
- And they don't, right.

351
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:18,470
- And I go, no, I'm kidding.

352
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,303
See, that's my...

353
00:10:19,303 --> 00:10:22,490
- That's my personality.
(audience laughs)

354
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,360
- And then, that creeps in at night.

355
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,360
And I go, oh, I don't think
so and so got my humor

356
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,305
at the funeral tonight.

357
00:10:28,305 --> 00:10:30,555
(laughing)

358
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:32,900
Right?

359
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,120
- No, I've never had that happen.

360
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,840
Today, on the show?
- Yeah, we have a great show.

361
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,830
- Kate Hudson is here.

362
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:38,663
- Yeah.
- Woo!

363
00:10:38,663 --> 00:10:39,590
- You ready for Kate Hudson?

364
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,212
(audience cheering and applauding)

365
00:10:41,212 --> 00:10:42,779
- Pitbull is also here!

366
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:43,860
- Winston Duke is here.
- Mr. Worldwide!

367
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,987
Yeah, and a performance by Daughtry.

368
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,650
- Now, tomorrow is the 4th of July.

369
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:49,723
And, all week long,

370
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,550
we're playing a special audience edition

371
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,540
of Stump the Hosts.

372
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,740
Where an audience member shares

373
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,050
a summer-themed truth or lie,

374
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,850
and we have to figure which one is true.

375
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,200
- Yeah, if they stump us,

376
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,260
they get a Kelly and Ryan mug,

377
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,460
and a $1,200 appliance
package from Cuisinart.

378
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,601
- Woo!
- That's right.

379
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:08,923
(audience cheering and applauding)

380
00:11:08,923 --> 00:11:10,050
- Alright.

381
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:13,610
- So far this week, we have not,

382
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:15,720
that's right, not been stumped.

383
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,399
- Wow!
- But the weeks is.

384
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:18,870
- It's still young.
- The week is young.

385
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:19,800
Cover your mug, Kelly.

386
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,320
- Okay.
- All right.

387
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,300

Jessica, happy 4th!

00:11:50,619 --> 00:11:52,245
- Nice.
- Woo!

405
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:54,080
- [Ryan] Good to have you with us.

406
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,692

00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,223

410
00:11:59,105 --> 00:11:59,938
- Yeah, that's right.

411
00:11:59,938 --> 00:12:02,220
Let's meet our participant
from Knoxville, Tennessee.

412
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,300
Where is Christie Bruce?
- Woo!

413
00:12:05,386 --> 00:12:07,074
- Christie Bruce!
- Woo!

414
00:12:07,074 --> 00:12:11,324
(audience applauding and cheering)

415
00:12:12,655 --> 00:12:14,266
- Hi!
- Woo!

416
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:15,544
- Hi, Christie!
- Hey, adorable.

417
00:12:15,544 --> 00:12:18,038
- Sweet girl.
- Oh, you are beautiful!

418
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:18,982
- Hi.
- Hi!

419
00:12:18,982 --> 00:12:19,815
- Hi.
- Hi!

420
00:12:19,815 --> 00:12:20,721
- How you doin'?
- I'm great.

421
00:12:20,721 --> 00:12:21,650
How are you doin'?
- Nice to see you.

422
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:22,490
It's a pleasure.
- I've got to tell you,

423
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:26,220
Christie Bruce, you
have an absolute joyful,

424
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,056
joyful sunshine face.
- Oh, thank you.

425
00:12:28,056 --> 00:12:29,044
- You do.
- You really do.

426
00:12:29,044 --> 00:12:31,063
You have a smile that makes me smile.

427
00:12:31,063 --> 00:12:32,216
- Well, good, I'm glad.

428
00:12:32,216 --> 00:12:33,367
- Yeah, that's good.

429
00:12:33,367 --> 00:12:34,980
- So, you should win bonus points.

430
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,826
- We hope so.
- Yes!

431
00:12:35,826 --> 00:12:36,830
- Just for that.
- Bonus points, yes!

432
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,467
- So, you're gonna give us two statements.

433
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:39,400
- Okay.
- Alright?

434
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,233
- Alright.
- And we're gonna try

435
00:12:40,233 --> 00:12:41,066
and guess which is true.

436
00:12:41,066 --> 00:12:41,950
If you stump us, you win.

437
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,300
- Okay.

438
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,760
Alright, this is gonna be hard.

439
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,980
- Okay.
- Okay, all right, here we go.

440
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,923
The first lie or, no, the
first truth or lie is,

441
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,460
growing up, we had a houseboat.

442
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,513
On Norris Lake, in Knoxville, Tennessee.

443
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,620
My family had a boat,

444
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,420
and we would all ski.

445
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,490
We would all do it.

446
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,330
There would four of us, sometimes five.

447
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,163
We would all line up,

448
00:13:05,163 --> 00:13:06,920
and we would do pyramids.

449
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,240
- Behind the houseboat?
- Behind the house,

450
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,073
well, not the houseboat,

451
00:13:09,073 --> 00:13:09,906
'cause we had a boat,

452
00:13:09,906 --> 00:13:11,770
but we kinda just--
- So you had a houseboat,

453
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,680
and a ski boat.
- Right, so we would go out,

454
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,750
and we would ski out,

455
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,010
and sometimes we would compete.

456
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:18,970
We were the McMichaels.

457
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,393
We would travel, and
do local competitions.

458
00:13:21,393 --> 00:13:22,251
- [Ryan] All right, what's the second one?

459
00:13:22,251 --> 00:13:23,198
Then, we'll start asking questions.

460
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:24,660
- The second one is

461
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,110
I was Miss Tiny Tot of Tennessee.

462
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,452
And, on 4th of July,

463
00:13:28,452 --> 00:13:30,080
I would do the 4th of July parade,

464
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,960
and sit on the convertible,

465
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,230
and wave to the crowd.
- Oh, wave.

466
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,390
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

467
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,200
Let me see your parade wave.

468
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,260
- Well, it was bad,

469
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,300
- Okay.
- Because, my mom told me

470
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,570
I would wave like this to everybody

471
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,792
and they're like, no, no,
no, you got to give it.

472
00:13:43,792 --> 00:13:44,625
You got to give it good.
- You really have

473
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,450
to use the whole arm.
- And, how old were you

474
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,660
when you were Miss Tiny Tot?

475
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,374
- I was seven.
- Seven.

476
00:13:49,374 --> 00:13:51,220
- Is Miss Tiny Tot--

477
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,053
- I don't care.
- A real thing?

478
00:13:52,053 --> 00:13:54,834
- I want her to be Miss
Tiny Tot because...

479
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:55,667
I think you're Miss

480
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:56,782
Tiny Tot on this show!
- Is there a Miss Tiny Tot

481
00:13:56,782 --> 00:13:57,615
circuit out there?

482
00:13:57,615 --> 00:13:59,664
- Miss Tiny Tot!
- It is very rare that I am

483
00:13:59,664 --> 00:14:01,206
bigger than somebody.
- I am tiny, yes, yes!

484
00:14:01,206 --> 00:14:03,330
So, you are our Miss Tiny Tot.

485
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:05,796
- What does the audience
have to say about this?

00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,360
I'm so tired.

647
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,400
- How old, is this six months?

648
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,730
The latest addition?

649
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:13,650
- Ope, she's six months.

650
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:14,960
Yesterday.
- Oh, so cute!

651
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,377
- Oh my gosh
- Look at her

652
00:19:16,377 --> 00:19:18,100
little thighs.
- That's--

653
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,710
- [Kate] Oh my God, you guys.

654
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,128
I'm out of my mind.
- Do you ever,

655
00:19:21,128 --> 00:19:22,130
do you chew on her legs?

656
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,720
Do you chew on her?
- I chew on everything.

657
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,520
- Mhm.
- (stammers) I mean,

658
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,058
we're all out of our minds

659
00:19:27,058 --> 00:19:28,078
with Rani.
- Yeah.

660
00:19:28,078 --> 00:19:29,088
- She's so cute.
- I love your copper

661
00:19:29,088 --> 00:19:30,230
pans though, those are nice.

662
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,950
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

663
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:32,783
- Copper pans?

664
00:19:32,783 --> 00:19:34,130
You noticed pans?
- I have copper pans.

665
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,243
- Yeah, she has beautiful

666
00:19:35,243 --> 00:19:36,870
copper pans.
- I actually collect copper.

667
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:37,703
- Oh, you do?
- Yeah.

668
00:19:37,703 --> 00:19:38,536
- Oh well, see.

669
00:19:38,536 --> 00:19:39,369
- And, I engrave them,

670
00:19:39,369 --> 00:19:40,560
and everything.
- Look at that.

671
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,393
- [Kate] Yeah.

672
00:19:41,393 --> 00:19:42,226
- That is so cute.
- It's so funny,

673
00:19:42,226 --> 00:19:44,890
I was so busy looking at the,

674
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,680
I was like, copper pans?
(Kate laughs)

675
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,513
- Oh, yeah.
- Ryan's like,

676
00:19:47,513 --> 00:19:48,848
nice copper pans.
- Yeah.

677
00:19:48,848 --> 00:19:51,020
I'm installing a kitchen right now.

678
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,500
- Are her big brother's involved?

679
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,570
Or, are they at the
place where they're like,

680
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,008
oh that's, you know,

681
00:19:57,008 --> 00:19:58,870
that's a diaper?
- Ryder's 15.

682
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:00,740
- Yeah.
- Which is crazy.

683
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,573
- I mean it's like,
- That's insane.

684
00:20:01,573 --> 00:20:03,490
- I mean, he's almost (stammers),

685
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:05,064
getting up to six-feet.

686
00:20:05,064 --> 00:20:08,610
And, he's such a great boy.

687
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:09,970
- He's a man.
- Young man.

688
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,612
- Yeah.
(sarcastic cries)

689
00:20:11,612 --> 00:20:12,740
- (laughs) It's okay.

690
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,566
- But, the other day we were--
- I do it all the time.

691
00:20:14,566 --> 00:20:15,399
- I know, I'm like,

692
00:20:15,399 --> 00:20:16,232
what is it?

693
00:20:16,232 --> 00:20:18,000
He's so old.

694
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,260
But no, the other day,
we went to breakfast,

695
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:24,260
and I was juggling a million things.

696
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,093
And, I think it's like,

697
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:27,950
you know, really wise to
go alone, with three kids.

698
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:28,783
You know, it's like hey,

699
00:20:28,783 --> 00:20:30,150
let's go to breakfast, kids.

700
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,577
And, the next thing you know,

701
00:20:31,577 --> 00:20:32,850
I'm not eating,

702
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,990
I'm juggling everything,

703
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:35,823
and I go to Ryder,

704
00:20:35,823 --> 00:20:37,630
Ryder, just take Rani.

705
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:40,020
And, I went to go get
my food at the buffet,

706
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,780
and I looked over,

707
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,930
and here's this young
man holding his sis--

708
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,160
It was the craziest

709
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,271
image to me.
- Yeah.

710
00:20:47,271 --> 00:20:48,600
- And, I just thought,

711
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,820
life is really weird.

712
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,570
- And, it goes fast.
- It's so fa--

713
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:53,940
Yeah, but I was like 12 when I--

714
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:54,991
I mean--
- You were 12 when--

715
00:20:54,991 --> 00:20:55,960
- Yeah, in terms of like,

716
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,250
a Hollywood actress.
- Right.

717
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,083
- Yeah.
- I say, in terms

718
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,850
of a Hollywood actress,

719
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,150
I was like a teen-mom.

720
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,470
I mean, that's, you know.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

721
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,130
- Yeah, me and Reese were like teen-moms.

722
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,100
- Yeah, that's true.
- You know, it's like,

723
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,363
we had kids really,

724
00:21:06,363 --> 00:21:07,196
super young.
- But you...

725
00:21:07,196 --> 00:21:09,250
I mean, just from your posts,

726
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:13,900
you don't let being a busy
mom not have you have fun.

727
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,671
Like, you still like really--
- Hold on...

728
00:21:15,671 --> 00:21:16,504
- Yeah.
(laughing)

729
00:21:16,504 --> 00:21:17,337
You know what I mean?

730
00:21:17,337 --> 00:21:18,170
- Yeah.
- Like, you still are you.

731
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:20,170
- But, don't you think you
learn that from your family?

732
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,640
Like, your family...
- Is--

733
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,920
- When I look at your family,

734
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,390
it's with admiration and envy,

735
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,530
'cause you all seem like you're having fun

736
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:28,773
all the time.
- All the time.

737
00:21:28,773 --> 00:21:30,947
- Yeah, my parents left us
to have fun all the time.

738
00:21:30,947 --> 00:21:32,320
It was like, where are you going?

739
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,121
They're like, we're going to Tahiti!

740
00:21:34,121 --> 00:21:36,401
(laughing)

741
00:21:36,401 --> 00:21:39,150
Okay.
- See you in two weeks!

742
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:40,583
- Yeah, exactly.

743
00:21:41,735 --> 00:21:42,690
Yeah, we do.

744
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:44,010
We have fun.

745
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,870
I mean, I make sure that
- You embrace it.

746
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:48,350
- You know, kids are good,

747
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,910
and that I take time to

748
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,990
you know, let out some steam.
- To enjoy.

749
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,280
- Yeah.
- Although, lately it's

750
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,740
been hard, 'cause I'm
still breast feeding.

751
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,923
I gotta be honest.
- Yeah.

752
00:21:55,923 --> 00:21:57,790
- It's like, my 40th is coming up,

753
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,733
and I keep saying,

754
00:21:58,733 --> 00:22:01,300
(stammers) I deserve a
really good hangover.

755
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,790
- Yes.
- And, it's gonna happen.

756
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,880
- Listen, I wanna give
you a birthday present.

757
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,440
I will watch your children
so you can go tie one on.

758
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,510
I will do the whole--
- And, I'll go...

759
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,817
I'll go tie one on with you.

760
00:22:11,817 --> 00:22:12,806
- That's good, perfect!

761
00:22:12,806 --> 00:22:13,639
- I will take care,

762
00:22:13,639 --> 00:22:14,738
I will take care of your babies.

763
00:22:14,738 --> 00:22:16,410
I'm very responsible.

764
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,610
So now, there's (stammers).
- Break it down.

765
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:19,750
- Musicians in your family.

766
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,350
You're very musical.

767
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,890
- I love to sing.
- Yeah.

768
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,110
- And, I play piano.

769
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,040
- I didn't know that.

770
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,140
- Yeah, but it's like,

771
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,210
I keep forgetting I can't
swear on these shows.

772
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:30,310
I almost went there.

773
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,080
I'm not very good at it.

774
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,110
I can write on the piano,

775
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,230
but I can't like sit down,

776
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,450
and read music,
- Wow.

777
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:39,080
- And be like, you know.
(Kelly mumbles)

778
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,019
- Yeah.
- Why don't you

779
00:22:40,019 --> 00:22:41,343
release a single?

780
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,600
- I have a movie coming out.

781
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,900
I think it's gonna be in the Fall,

782
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,550
that's a musical that Sia directed.

783
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:49,010
- Oh.
- Oh, wow.

784
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,390
- Yeah, it's the first time I've actually

785
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:52,523
sang contemporary music.

786
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,620
That's really exciting.

787
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,530
And, I think after that,

788
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,880
I'll probably even just (stammers).

789
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,100
I feel like it's one of those things

790
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,740
I have to do at some point.

791
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,750
I just have to put something out there.

792
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,947
- Listen--
- I don't care what it does--

793
00:23:03,947 --> 00:23:05,930
- You know people that work on the radio.

794
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:08,233
- Oh yeah, that's right.
- Yeah.

795
00:23:08,233 --> 00:23:09,890
- Oh, that guy.
- I tell ya' how

796
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,390
to make it a hit.
- Yeah?

797
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,862
- Collaborate with DJ Khalid.

798
00:23:12,862 --> 00:23:14,142
- Right.
- That's right.

799
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:15,340
- That's all you gotta do.

800
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,220
Just get DJ Khalid, Kate Hudson--

801
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,397
- Or, Mr. WorldWide.

802
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,603
- Or, Mr. WorldWide!
- Mr. WorldWide.

803
00:23:19,603 --> 00:23:20,812
- Mr. WorldWide.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

804
00:23:20,812 --> 00:23:21,850
- I got it.

805
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:23,807
You know what though?

806
00:23:23,807 --> 00:23:24,640
I have to say,

807
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,860
I miss bands.

808
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,693
I really do.

809
00:23:26,693 --> 00:23:28,130
Like, my son's really musical.

810
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:29,975
Bing is insane--

811
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:32,310
(stammers) Almost...

812
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,540
He drums.

813
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,540
I can't get him out of his

814
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,373
drumming room.
- That's great.

815
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:36,740
- He's now started playing keyboard,

816
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,840
and he's never had a piano--
(Kelly murmurs)

817
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,727
Oh yeah, he's not even

818
00:23:38,727 --> 00:23:40,150
eight years old.
- He's got it in the genes.

819
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,150
- It's kind of crazy.

820
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:42,410
And, I just thought...

821
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:44,730
Oh, he's gonna get in a band,

822
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,175
and like, ugh,

823
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:47,790
it's gonna be tough (laughs).
- Yeah, yeah.

824
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,346
He's gonna tour the world.
- It's gonna be a hard life.

825
00:23:49,346 --> 00:23:51,510
- No, but it's an exciting life.

826
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,770
Don't you think?

827
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:55,327
- Being (stammers) a touring musician?

828
00:23:55,327 --> 00:23:56,717
(sighs)
- Well, she was--

829
00:23:56,717 --> 00:23:57,797
- Yeah, but I mean--
- You have some

830
00:23:57,797 --> 00:23:58,630
experience with that.

831
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:00,810
- I mean, it's a lot of work.

832
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:01,643
You know?
- Yeah.

833
00:24:01,643 --> 00:24:02,750
- And, it's amazing when you love it.

834
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,530
But, it's a whole different like--

835
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:05,530
Jazz Cats.

836
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:06,363
- Oh.
- Like, all the people

837
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:07,770
that I'm really close to,

838
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:11,717
and touring musicians
who still spend 200 days

839
00:24:11,717 --> 00:24:13,060
of the year on the road.
- On the road.

840
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,070
- But, I'm thinking about
your parents, right.

841
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:15,903
They were probably like,

842
00:24:15,903 --> 00:24:17,380
oh gosh, not acting.

843
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,213
It's such a,

844
00:24:18,213 --> 00:24:19,860
like an unstable career, right?

845
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,250
If you have a calling for it.
- Yeah, do it.

846
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,580
- Imagine if your mom said to you,

847
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,260
Kate listen, anything but acting.

848
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,093
- Yeah.
- Right?

849
00:24:27,093 --> 00:24:28,140
- That would have been very, yeah.

850
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,050
It would have been hard--

851
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,210
- But, you're entrepreneuring.

852
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,540
I mean, you've got all of these

853
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,007
fashion brands--
- I just can't stop working.

854
00:24:33,007 --> 00:24:35,050
- Great!
- I love to work, and--

855
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,380
- [Kelly] Well, you're good at it.

856
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,580
- I've always wanted to design clothes.

857
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,890
- What's Happy By Nature?

858
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:42,170
- So, Happy By Nature is my first like,

859
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:43,460
ready-to-wear fashion line.

860
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,530
- It's fantastic.

861
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:45,956
I'm so happy for you.
- Thank you,

862
00:24:45,956 --> 00:24:46,804
I'm really excited.

863
00:24:46,804 --> 00:24:47,676
I'm excited.

864
00:24:47,676 --> 00:24:49,830
It's one of those things I've been

865
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,940
working really hard on it.

866
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,780
I feel like every time I
put my name to anything,

867
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,780
whether I'm endorsing it,

868
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:58,270
or banking it, like this.
- Right.

869
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,127
- I have to believe in it.

870
00:24:59,127 --> 00:25:01,240
It has to be something
that I feel is important.

871
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,240
And so, this is a very eco-friendly line,

872
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,570
and the fashion industry
is like the worst,

873
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:11,380
number two worst carbon
footprint of all industries.

874
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,900
And, I really feel like
the fashion industry

875
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,610
needs to look at how
they're making things,

876
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:18,290
and start changing the
way that they do stuff.

877
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,610
And, I feel like we--
(audience applauds)

878
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:21,443
Yeah.
- Well--

879
00:25:21,443 --> 00:25:23,213
- And, I feel like we're gonna really,

880
00:25:23,213 --> 00:25:24,657
hopefully make an impact there.

881
00:25:24,657 --> 00:25:26,460
- Well, you're a nature girl.

882
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,080
So, you grew up...
- Yeah.

883
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,315
- In nature, really.
- Yeah.

884
00:25:29,315 --> 00:25:30,264
- I mean--
- In Brentwood.

885
00:25:30,264 --> 00:25:31,097
- In Brent--

886
00:25:31,097 --> 00:25:32,610
- No, but she also, Colorado.
- No.

887
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:33,875
- She's a Colorado girl.
- Colorado.

888
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:34,708
- Oh, Colorado, okay.

889
00:25:34,708 --> 00:25:36,344
- And then, Brentwood.
- Then Brentwood.

890
00:25:36,344 --> 00:25:37,635
- [Kelly] Yeah.
(laughing)

891

(Kelly and Ryan stammer)

892

- Yeah, yeah.

893
00:25:41,932 --> 00:25:43,970
- This is beautiful.
- Thank you.

901
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,320
- I remember putting on a brave face

902
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,820
to hide my symptoms of depression.

903
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,222
I was on an anti-depressant,

904
00:26:04,222 --> 00:26:06,783
but I still had depression symptoms.

905
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,800
It was tough getting through the day,

906
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,173
hiding how I really felt.

907
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,570
Something had to change.

908
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:17,210
So, I talked to my doctor, for real.

909
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:19,740
No more saying oh, I'm fine.

910
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:23,570
This time, I spoke up about
living behind the mask.

911
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:25,310
And, he told me about Rexulti.

912
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,820
He said that Rexulti,

913
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,490
when added to an anti-depressant,

914
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:31,630
has been proven to help
reduce symptoms of depression.

915
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,840
Without giving up the progress

916
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,320
I may have made on my anti-depressant.

917
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,340
- [Narrator] Rexulti is not for everyone.

918
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,970
Call your doctor about
unusual changes in behavior,

919
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:43,060
worsening depression,
or thoughts of suicide.

920
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,320
Anti-depressants can increase

921
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,090
these in those 24, and younger.

922
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:48,270
Elderly dementia patients taking Rexulti

923
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:50,490
have an increased risk of death or stroke.

924
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:52,103
Call your doctor if you have high-fever,

925
00:26:52,103 --> 00:26:53,940
stiff muscles, and confusion,

926
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,330
to address a possible
life-threatening condition.

927
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:58,150
Or, if you have uncontrollable
muscle movements,

928
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,710
as these may be permanent.

929
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,460
Rexulti has been shown to increase

930
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,980
blood-sugar in some people.

931
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:05,800
Other risks are increased
cholesterol, weight gain,

932
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,070
unusual urges or compulsive behaviors,

933
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,410
decreased white blood-cells,

934
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:12,100
which can be serious,
dizziness on standing,

935
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,900
seizures, trouble swallowing,

936
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,000
and impaired judgment or motor skills.

937
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,520
- It was time to make a change.

938
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,253
That's why I asked my
doctor about adding Rexulti.

- Hi!
(Pitbull murmurs)

986
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:11,958
How are you?

987
00:29:13,116 --> 00:29:14,878
- Yes, sir.
- Good to see you, baby.

988
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,711
- Yes, sir.
- Love it.

989
00:29:18,194 --> 00:29:19,529
I mean, the fans.
(laughing)

990
00:29:19,529 --> 00:29:21,094
The fans go nuts.

991
00:29:21,094 --> 00:29:21,927
- Yeah.

992
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:24,050
- Armando fans are here.
- (mumbles) Yee-ooh!

993
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:27,093
(audience applauding and cheering)

994
00:29:27,093 --> 00:29:29,002
I think I got the wrong glasses on.

995
00:29:29,002 --> 00:29:31,085
- Oh yeah, yeah.
- Are these your glasses?

996
00:29:31,085 --> 00:29:32,060
- Oh my gosh.

997
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,650
I know, I'm sorry.

998
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:35,160
You look--
- Studious.

999
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,667
- But, I can see everybody
really close right now.

1000
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:38,718
(laughing)

1001
00:29:38,718 --> 00:29:39,907
- Sorry about that.

1002
00:29:39,907 --> 00:29:40,740
Sorry (laughs).

1003
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,630
- So listen...
- Boom, there we go.

1004
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:45,170
- To go back for people
who don't know your story.

1005
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:47,180
- Yeah.
- It is an incredible story.

1006
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,187
- Been very blessed, thank God.

1007
00:29:48,187 --> 00:29:49,020
(knocking)

1008
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:49,853
Thanks for the fans.

1009
00:29:49,853 --> 00:29:50,686
I wouldn't be here without y'all.

1010
00:29:50,686 --> 00:29:51,519
- I wanna talk about--

1011
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:53,870
(audience applauding and cheering)

1012
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:55,500
The challenges at the beginning for you,

1013
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,710
and what you did to overcome,

1014
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:57,960
to get to be who you are now.

1015
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,810
- Well, I mean...

1016
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:00,890
Oof..

1017
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:02,320
A lot of different obstacles,

1018
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,153
but I think that,

1019
00:30:03,153 --> 00:30:04,427
that's what makes the journey fun.

1020
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:06,224
You know, from nothing to something.

1021
00:30:06,224 --> 00:30:07,406
A whole lot of no's.

1022
00:30:07,406 --> 00:30:08,430
- Yeah.
- That's for sure.

1023
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,470
And, a whole lot of you can't,

1024
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:10,810
you won't, you never will,

1025
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:12,130
don't, you're crazy,

1026
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:13,860
how dare you, impossible.

1027
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,020
And then, I flipped every word,

1028
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:15,890
by the way.
- Yeah.

1029
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:16,760
- So, my daughter taught me,

1030
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,303
in the word impossible, is possible.

1031
00:30:18,303 --> 00:30:19,543
- Yeah.
- Right?

1032
00:30:19,543 --> 00:30:21,660
And, I took the word can't, is can.

1033
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,850
- Yeah.
- Won't, is won.

1034
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:24,966
- Yes.
- Don't, is do.

1035
00:30:24,966 --> 00:30:26,480
- Yes.
- And, that's exactly

1036
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,620
what we doin' with our career.

1037
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:30,315
- It's really--
- 20 years in the game, baby.

1038
00:30:30,315 --> 00:30:32,176
- 20 years too.
- Yeah.

1039
00:30:32,176 --> 00:30:34,673
- Isn't that great?
- Amazing.

1040
00:30:34,673 --> 00:30:38,370
- You got your first record
deal from a rap battle.

1041
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,410
- Yeah, it was a rap battle against,

1042
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:41,243
back in the day,

1043
00:30:41,243 --> 00:30:42,440
was a crew called "The Ruff Ryders".

1044
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,436
A guy named DMX
- Yes, of course.

1045
00:30:43,436 --> 00:30:44,610
- Was a part of it.
- Yeah.

1046
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:46,579
- I was very, I was
invited to his video shoot,

1047
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:47,910
and I battled this guy named Drag-on,

1048
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:48,780
at the video shoot,

1049
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,853
Swizz Beatz was there.

1050
00:30:49,853 --> 00:30:51,248
- Mhm.
- And, Swizz Beatz told me

1051
00:30:51,248 --> 00:30:53,660
I'll give you three rounds with the Drag--

1052
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,030
'Cause, he's a dragon, you know.

1053
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:55,863
He's gonna burn you.

1054
00:30:55,863 --> 00:30:57,498
I said man, I'm just happy to be here.

1055
00:30:57,498 --> 00:30:58,950
- [Kelly] Right.
(laughing)

1056
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,070
- I had home-court advantage.

1057
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:00,903
It was in Miami.

1058
00:31:00,903 --> 00:31:01,736
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1059
00:31:01,736 --> 00:31:02,569
- Okay.

1060
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,140
And, I flipped a couple words
in Spanish here and there.

1061
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,350
Called out a couple neighborhoods.

1062
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,368
It worked out, you know?

1063
00:31:06,368 --> 00:31:08,458
And, we won (laughs).

1064
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:10,038
- Oh my gosh, that's great.
- Yeah.

1065
00:31:10,038 --> 00:31:11,358
- And, that's where it all started?

1066
00:31:11,358 --> 00:31:12,191
- Yup.

1067
00:31:12,191 --> 00:31:13,024
You know what's crazy,

1068
00:31:13,024 --> 00:31:14,230
is that's on video.

1069
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:15,063
And the footage,

1070
00:31:15,063 --> 00:31:16,250
you can't find it anywhere.

1071
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,233
- Really?
- Crazy enough, yeah.

1072
00:31:17,233 --> 00:31:18,410
There's a guy out there,

1073
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:19,390
Jamie, if you're looking at this,

1074
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:20,966
I know you still got
that footage (mumbles).

1075
00:31:20,966 --> 00:31:21,799
- [Kelly] Jamie!

1076
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:22,778
- Let's go, cough it up.
- You need to show

1077
00:31:22,778 --> 00:31:23,630
the world that, Jamie.

1078
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,410
- I would love to see that.
- Oh, you will.

1079
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:26,243
You will.
- Yeah.

1080
00:31:26,243 --> 00:31:27,076
- Now that I said that, you'll see it.

1081
00:31:27,076 --> 00:31:27,909
It'll get out, one way or another.

1082
00:31:27,909 --> 00:31:29,910
- And also, when you were growing up,

1083
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:31,550
- Yeah.
- Your mom would put on

1084
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:32,470
tapes of Tony Robbins
- Yup.

1085
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,367
- In the car, right?

1086
00:31:33,367 --> 00:31:34,340
- So, I lived in a neighborhood

1087
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,718
called Carol City, in Miami.

1088
00:31:35,718 --> 00:31:37,910
- Yeah.
- And...

1089
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:39,760
I was not trying to
listen to Tony Robbins.

1090
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,920
And, whenever my mom
could take me to school,

1091
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,660
it was an '82 Pinto that she
would take me to school in,

1092
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,800
and she said,

1093
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,790
she put Tony on.

1094
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:47,623
I wanted to hear like,

1095
00:31:47,623 --> 00:31:48,906
2 Live Crew, and Poison Clan.

1096
00:31:48,906 --> 00:31:50,740
(laughing)

1097
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:53,260
So, one day I go to change the radio to,

1098
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,100
you know, to my music,

1099
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,130
and she's like, (smack), bam.

1100
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:57,050
She said, do you pay for this car?

1101
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,210
I said, no.

1102
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:00,314
She said, well then don't touch my radio.

1103
00:32:00,314 --> 00:32:02,117
(laughing)

1104
00:32:02,117 --> 00:32:03,980
- And so, you were
listening to Tony Robbins?

1105
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,303
- So, subliminally, I
started listening to Tony,

1106
00:32:05,303 --> 00:32:07,160
and all it took was one story.

1107
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,570
Which was a story about Colonel Sander's,

1108
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:10,250
and how it took him 1,007 no's

1109
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:12,317
before he could sell his recipe.

1110
00:32:12,317 --> 00:32:13,610
And, I thought about it like,

1111
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:15,370
man it's hard to get one no out of my mom.

1112
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:17,740
I go, man, imagine 1,007 of 'em.

1113
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,667
So, the word no became yes.

1114
00:32:19,667 --> 00:32:21,610
You know, I welcome failure.

1115
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:22,450
I welcome the slip.

1116
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:23,283
I welcome the fall.

1117
00:32:23,283 --> 00:32:24,211
I welcome the no.

1118
00:32:24,211 --> 00:32:25,120
I mean, you guys know.

1119
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,490
- Yeah, of course.
- You know, and failure's

1120
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:28,400
the mother of all success.

1121
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,033
And, I've learned that
through out the game.

1122
00:32:30,033 --> 00:32:32,900
Every record that has been
huge for us around the world,

1123
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,140
thanks to you guys,

1124
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,390
every record exec said,

1125
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:37,010
mmm not gonna work.

1126

That's what it--
- Yeah.

1286
00:37:14,473 --> 00:37:15,370
- You know, who cares?

1287
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:17,020
Forget about following.

1288
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:17,853
You know, be yourself.

1289
00:37:17,853 --> 00:37:18,757
Love yourself.

1290
00:37:18,757 --> 00:37:19,590
- Yeah.
- And, that's what this

1291
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:20,423
movie's all about.

1292
00:37:20,423 --> 00:37:21,520
You got Uglyville, and Perfectville.

1293
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,387
And, guess what?

1294
00:37:22,387 --> 00:37:23,350
Everybody in Uglyville,

1295
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,310
man, they love each other,

1296
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:25,170
they have fun with each other,

1297
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:26,080
make fun of each other,

1298
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,190
they enjoy each other.

1299
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,106
Everybody in Perfectville,

1300
00:37:28,106 --> 00:37:28,939
they just,

1301
00:37:28,939 --> 00:37:29,772
you know,
- Mhm.

1302
00:37:29,772 --> 00:37:30,780
- Everybody does the same thing,

1303
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,120
and they all look the same.

1304
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,450
So, Uglyville...

1305
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:34,831
I can't spoil the movie for y'all.

1306
00:37:34,831 --> 00:37:36,826
(laughing)

1307
00:37:36,826 --> 00:37:38,439
You know?

1308
00:37:38,439 --> 00:37:39,272
- I do like the way you,

1309
00:37:39,272 --> 00:37:40,105
I like the way you were

1310
00:37:40,105 --> 00:37:40,938
acting it out though.
- I get loose,

1311
00:37:40,938 --> 00:37:41,771
I have fun.

1312
00:37:41,771 --> 00:37:42,650
You know, we get a chance to enjoy,

1313
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:44,170
and so it was a lot of fun.

1314
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:45,870
Obviously, you see I'm
very excited about it.

1315
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:48,020
And, they gave me a
chance to actually be me

1316
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,220
in a cartoon character.

1317
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,273
- It's really great.
- Yeah, it's a lot of fun.

1318
00:37:51,273 --> 00:37:54,270
- Have you thought about
being you in a movie?

1319
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:55,107
- Well, you know,

1320
00:37:55,107 --> 00:37:56,060
let me tell you,

1321
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,443
I'm Mr. WorldWide, alright?

1322
00:37:57,443 --> 00:37:59,170
But, Ryan...

1323
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:01,232
Okay, Ryan is Mr. Non-Exclusive.

1324
00:38:01,232 --> 00:38:03,450
(laughing)

1325
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:05,344
This man has a deal with everybody.

1326
00:38:05,344 --> 00:38:06,480
(laughing)

1327
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,313
So I'm like, Ryan,

1328
00:38:07,313 --> 00:38:08,680
how can I use your attorney?

1329
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,310
Okay?
(laughing)

1330
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:11,270
So, you would understand me,

1331
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:12,177
when it comes to movies,

1332
00:38:12,177 --> 00:38:14,050
I like to be more off-camera,

1333
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:15,280
invest, and be partners in it.

1334
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,180
- So, are you saying
- But--

1335
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:18,605
- You want Ryan to star as you--

1336
00:38:18,605 --> 00:38:22,394
- Oh, that would be great.
- Let me see the glasses.

1337
00:38:22,394 --> 00:38:23,227
- There you go.

1338
00:38:23,227 --> 00:38:24,373
What?

1339
00:38:24,373 --> 00:38:27,424
Ayy, get it, get it,
get it, get it, get it!

1340
00:38:27,424 --> 00:38:30,325
(laughing)
(applause and cheering)

1341
00:38:30,325 --> 00:38:33,514
- I just wanna watch this all day.

1342
00:38:33,514 --> 00:38:34,681
Don't, wait...

1343
00:38:35,874 --> 00:38:36,885
- Oh, that was great.
- What?

1344
00:38:36,885 --> 00:38:38,424
- Greatest thing I've ever seen.

1345
00:38:38,424 --> 00:38:40,674

- [Announcer] Friday, on Live.

1350
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:47,803
Ricky Gervais.

1351
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,580
- This July 4th...

1352
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,810
- Things are getting strange around here.

1353
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:57,070
- [Announcer] Next Live, the
boys of "Stranger Things",

1354
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,803
house-band O.A.R,

1355
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:00,870
and 4th of July games.

1356
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:01,989
It's gonna be big.

1357
00:39:01,989 --> 00:39:03,888
- [Kelly] Like, inflatable flamingo big.

1358
00:39:03,888 --> 00:39:06,360
(laughing)

1359
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:09,060
- My body is truly powerful.

1360
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:12,117
- I have the power to lower
my blood-sugar, and A1C.

1361
00:39:12,117 --> 00:39:14,660
- Because, I can still
make my own insulin,

1362
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:17,150
and Trulicity activates
my body to release it.

1363
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:18,220
Like, it's supposed to.

1364
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,700
- [Narrator] Trulicity is for
people with type 2 diabetes.

1365
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,880
It's not insulin.

1366
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,820
- [Man] I take it once a week.

1367
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:25,240
It starts acting in my
body from the first dose.

1368
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,520
- [Narrator] Trulicity isn't for people

1369
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,780
with type 1 diabetes,

1370
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,590
or diabetic ketoacidosis.

1371
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:31,830
Don't take Trulicity if
you're allergic to it,

1372
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:34,310
you or your family have
medullary thyroid cancer,

1373
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:37,290
or have multiple endocrine
neoplasia syndrome type 2.

1374
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:39,500
Stop Trulicity, and call
your doctor right away,

1375
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,040
if you have an allergic reaction,

1376
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,340
a lump or swelling in your neck,

1377
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,660
or severe stomach pain.

1378
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:46,220
Serious side effects may
include pancreatitis.

1379
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:49,120
Taking Trulicity with a
sulfonylureas, or insulin,

1380
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,840
increases low blood-sugar risk.

1381
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,000
Side effects include nausea, diarrhea,

1382
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,169
vomiting, belly pain,
and decreased apetite.

1383
00:39:55,169 --> 00:39:56,880
Which lead to dehydration,

1384
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,170
and may worsen kidney problems.

1385
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:02,240
- I have it within me to lower my A1C.

1386
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,490
- [Narrator] Ask your
doctor about Trulicity.

a "Black Panther 2".

1445
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:12,076
- Good.
- Yeah.

1446
00:42:12,076 --> 00:42:13,820
- In the works.

1447
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:17,370
Everything's very hush-hush with Marvel,

1448
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:18,380
and Disney.
- Right.

1449
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,849
- Around it.
- Yes.

1450
00:42:19,849 --> 00:42:23,160
- You know, if you're
eager for a M'Baku fix,

1451
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,105
I'll be in the...

1452
00:42:25,105 --> 00:42:28,246
"The Avengers Infinity War Part 2".

1453
00:42:28,246 --> 00:42:29,756
- Okay, great.
- So, that's coming.

1454
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:31,155
- That's coming as well.
- That is great.

1455
00:42:31,155 --> 00:42:32,486
- And, we understand as well,

1456
00:42:32,486 --> 00:42:33,500
you're celebrating all the success,

1457
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,490
you bought a house?

1458
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:35,690
- I did, I did.

1459
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:36,523
- Congratulations,

1460
00:42:36,523 --> 00:42:37,461
happy home owner.
- Thank you, so much.

1461
00:42:37,461 --> 00:42:38,366
Thank you, so much.

1462
00:42:38,366 --> 00:42:40,866
- You know, that's what it is.

1463
00:42:41,843 --> 00:42:43,340
I thought you looked more burdened

1464
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,350
than the last time I saw you.

1465
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:47,910
- I think it's with all
the home renovations.

1466
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:49,090
That's what it is.

1467
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:51,250
You know, finding furniture that fits.

1468
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:52,430
- Exactly.
- Yes, yes.

1469
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:54,370
Especially 'cause I'm a big guy.

1470
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:57,080
So, I'm always trying
to make the things work,

1471
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,210
but you know,
- Yeah.

1472
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:00,230
- It's all about size and scale.

1473
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:02,130
- You want a sumptuous sofa.

1474
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:03,342
- I like that word.
- Yes.

1475
00:43:03,342 --> 00:43:04,240
(laughing)

1476
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,340
- Sumptuous.
- Yeah.

1477
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:06,420
- So, you have to,

1478
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:09,380
you actually are shopping
for larger than normal

1479
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:11,550
couches?
- I'm not larger than normal,

1480
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:12,401
it's just...

1481
00:43:12,401 --> 00:43:13,910
Things that fit me,

1482
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:15,577
but also are in proportion to the home.

1483
00:43:15,577 --> 00:43:18,140
- You know, these chairs
seem to fit you well.

1484
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,290
Maybe you'd like to--
- These work great.

1485
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:21,900
- These could be great
for the dining room.

1486
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,971
- Is this a gift?
- Yes, absolutely.

1487
00:43:23,971 --> 00:43:24,804
This is gift.

1488
00:43:24,804 --> 00:43:27,561
Gelman, we need new chairs.

1489
00:43:27,561 --> 00:43:29,210
(laughing)

1490
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:32,170
- Are you moving anything
from your current place,

1491
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:33,710
into the new place?

1492
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:35,450
- Couple things.

1493
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:38,530
But, really it's mainly
our first family home

1494
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:40,027
in the states, you know?
- So great.

1495
00:43:40,027 --> 00:43:43,150
- So, it's been just a
pleasure to be able to do that.

1496
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:44,612
Be the first one to purchase--

1497
00:43:44,612 --> 00:43:45,580
- Oh, but you have...

1498
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:46,772
He has citrus.

1499
00:43:46,772 --> 00:43:49,210
(stammers) It's her dream to have citrus.

1500
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:51,240
- My dream is to have a citrus plant

1501
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,073
of some kind.
- Yeah.

1502
00:43:52,073 --> 00:43:53,160
- I live in New York City,

1503
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:56,310
so that dream is probably
never going to happen.

1504
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:58,480
Ryan, unbeknownst to me,

1505
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,503
in all of the years
- I was keeping it on

1506
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:00,890
- We've known each other,
- The DL, like the sequel.

1507
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:02,412
- Has an orang grove.

1508
00:44:02,412 --> 00:44:03,660
- Oh my God.
- Okay?

1509
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:05,680
He has a secret orange grove.

1510
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,380
What do you have?
- In my secret garden.

1511
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:10,471
- I have kumquats.
- Oh, no kidding!

1512
00:44:10,471 --> 00:44:14,020
- Kumquats, and I actually--
- The baby orange!

1513
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:17,080
- You can eat them whole.
- Yes, I actually,

1514
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,360
'cause the skin is sweet,

1515
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,750
and the inside is sour.

1516
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:20,921
- Yes.
- So, they're this like,

1517
00:44:20,921 --> 00:44:23,330
awesome little fruit.
- You can make a chutney

1518
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:25,260
out of it.
- Ooh.

1519
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:27,351
- I will make you some kumquat chutney!

1520
00:44:27,351 --> 00:44:28,184
- Ooh, she said chutney.

1521
00:44:28,184 --> 00:44:29,017
- I will make you a chutney.

1522
00:44:29,017 --> 00:44:29,850
Can you say it again?

1523
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:30,951
Can you say it again?
- Yeah, chutney.

1524
00:44:30,951 --> 00:44:32,810
You can make chutney out of your kumquats.

1525
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:33,989
Did you know that?
- Yes, yes.

1526
00:44:33,989 --> 00:44:35,000
And, I have a little present for you.

1527
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,441
I brought you some--
- Chutney.

1528
00:44:36,441 --> 00:44:37,274
(Kelly gasps)

1529
00:44:37,274 --> 00:44:38,172
- My kumquats.
- No, you didn't!

1530
00:44:38,172 --> 00:44:39,005
- Yeah I did, I did.

1531
00:44:39,005 --> 00:44:40,143
- Are these your kumquats?
- Yes, these are my kumquats.

1532
00:44:40,143 --> 00:44:42,300
- I am going to chutney this.

1533
00:44:44,199 --> 00:44:45,116
Oh my gosh.

1534
00:44:48,182 --> 00:44:49,015
Really?

1535
00:44:49,015 --> 00:44:50,030
You just popped one right in?
- Yeah.

1536
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:50,863
- Really?
- They're like,

1537
00:44:50,863 --> 00:44:52,100
satisfying in a poppy way.

1538
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:52,933
- Yeah, yeah.

1539
00:44:52,933 --> 00:44:53,766
They're intense.

1540
00:44:53,766 --> 00:44:54,599
They're very intense.

1541
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:55,432
(mumbles)

1542
00:44:55,432 --> 00:44:56,265
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1543
00:44:56,265 --> 00:44:57,450
- These are fresh.

1544
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:58,401
- Yeah, they're very fresh.

1545
00:44:58,401 --> 00:44:59,234
(laughing)

1546
00:44:59,234 --> 00:45:00,067
They're from my tree.

1547
00:45:00,067 --> 00:45:00,900
They're from my tree,
- I can't believe

1548
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:01,801
- Winston Zone.
- You brought--

1549
00:45:01,801 --> 00:45:03,500
(laughing)

1550
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,380
We're gonna make you,

1551
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:06,040
we're gonna make,

1552
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,860
manufacture your chutney.

1553
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:09,670
M'Baku's chutney.

1554
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:11,241
(laughing)

1555
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:13,081
- M'Baku's vegetarian chutney.

1556
00:45:13,081 --> 00:45:14,139
- Tell me that...

1557
00:45:14,139 --> 00:45:14,972
- I think that's

1558
00:45:14,972 --> 00:45:16,011
a glorious idea.
- That is a trillion

1559
00:45:16,011 --> 00:45:17,490
dollar idea.
- Do you...

1560
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:18,323
Do you cook?

1561
00:45:18,323 --> 00:45:20,010
I'm gonna grab my (mumbles).
- I cook a little bit,

1562
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:22,620
but because my size is
always going up and down

1563
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:23,591
for each role--
- Yeah, I know the feeling.

1564
00:45:23,591 --> 00:45:25,209
(laughing)

1565
00:45:25,209 --> 00:45:26,550
- Do you have to do that a lot?

1566
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:27,383
- A lot, a lot.

1567
00:45:27,383 --> 00:45:29,300
So, for M'Baku, I had gained about

1568
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:30,327
40 pounds.
- Right.

1569
00:45:30,327 --> 00:45:33,570
- And then, for upcoming movie "Us",

1570
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:35,280
- Right.
- Jordan Peele didn't want

1571
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,040
me to feel like a super hero.

1572
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:37,873
So he was like,

1573
00:45:37,873 --> 00:45:39,923
if you could just eat some
burgers, or something.

1574
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,670
So you could look just like a
dad who has responsibilities

1575
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:44,980
other than going to the gym.

1576
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,100
- Isn't that amazing?

1577
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:47,327
Like, (stammers).

1578
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:50,120
And, I think that this
is a uniquely male thing,

1579
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,980
that men in their roles,

1580
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:54,960
can go up and down the
scale with relative ease.

1581
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,711
Like, just have a couple of burgers.

1582
00:45:56,711 --> 00:45:58,210
- Yeah, (stammers).

1583
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:00,530
That was fun,

1584
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:02,540
but then losing the weight is not.

1585
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:03,373
- Oh, okay.

1586
00:46:03,373 --> 00:46:04,259
Well, I'm glad to hear you say that.

1587
00:46:04,259 --> 00:46:05,092
- Let's take a break.

1588
00:46:05,092 --> 00:46:06,160
This is your treat.

1589
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,240
Just plant those,

1590
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,840
and have your very own citrus tree.

1591
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,848
- Until the first frost.

1592
00:46:10,848 --> 00:46:11,681
- We'll be right back,

1593
00:46:11,681 --> 00:46:12,532
and talk about "Us",

1594
00:46:12,532 --> 00:46:13,365
right after this.

That's when I found MarketPro Home Buyers.

1678

Dan visited our home,

1679

- We are scared in thrillers like this.

1706
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:59,441
- Yes.
- Yes, Jordan Peele...

1707
00:49:59,441 --> 00:50:03,560
I am convinced is a terrifying
person in real life.

1708
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,210
- He actually is really just like,

1709
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:08,060
a calm, smooth, unassuming guy.

1710
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:09,983
You never think that
was going on up there.

1711
00:50:09,983 --> 00:50:12,294
- What is going on up there?
- Yeah, yeah.

1712
00:50:12,294 --> 00:50:13,250
That's really the thing.
- Honestly.

1713
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:16,710
How does he come up with these scenarios?

1714
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:18,580
- I think he's just very imaginative,

1715
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:20,850
you know, his take on American cinema,

1716
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:23,983
'cause I feel that's
really what "Get Out",

1717
00:50:23,983 --> 00:50:25,350
and this movie is doing,

1718
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:27,710
is interrogating America as a culture.

1719
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:29,960
With really interesting what-ifs.

1720
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,680
- And, how many people live through this?

1721
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,570
'Cause, it looks--
- I can't tell you that one.

1722
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:35,674
- Do you survive?
- I can't tell you that one.

1723
00:50:35,674 --> 00:50:36,507
- What can you tell us

1724
00:50:36,507 --> 00:50:37,340
about this?
- What can you tell

1725
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:38,173
us about "Us"?

1726
00:50:38,173 --> 00:50:39,006
What can you tell us?

1727
00:50:40,175 --> 00:50:43,040
- What I can say is that it's deeply,

1728
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,170
really just a family drama.

1729
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:49,000
It's about a family caught
in an interesting scenario,

1730
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,410
and they have to fight for their lives,

1731
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:53,714
and they're confronted with,

1732
00:50:53,714 --> 00:50:55,543
essentially, their own demons.

1733
00:50:55,543 --> 00:50:58,130
Which are these doppelganger figures.

1734
00:50:58,130 --> 00:50:58,963
- Oh boy.
- That look

1735
00:50:58,963 --> 00:51:00,030
exactly like them.

1736
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:01,330
- [Ryan] But, at least you have a bat.

1737
00:51:01,330 --> 00:51:03,303
- Yeah (laughs).
- I mean, look...

1738
00:51:03,303 --> 00:51:06,750
I want everybody to look at that photo.

1739
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:07,583
Tell...

1740
00:51:07,583 --> 00:51:09,221
That is, I mean.
- Yeah.

1741
00:51:09,221 --> 00:51:10,054
- Terrifying.
- Yeah.

1742
00:51:10,054 --> 00:51:11,780
- Terrifying.
- It's terrifying,

1743
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:13,420
and then, you know,

1744
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:14,910
being in that space,

1745
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:16,600
being in that head space and that body,

1746
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,550
was really tough to stay in.

1747
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:20,750
Because, you have to go to a,

1748
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:23,410
I have to go to a really
interesting place.

1749
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:24,670
But, we're really well supported.

1750
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:26,910
- Was it a heavy place?

1751
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:29,560
- Heavy emotionally.

1752
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:31,590
Because, I can't tell you anything

1753
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:32,810
without giving a big
- Right, I know.

1754
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:34,620
- Spoiler.
- Right, right.

1755
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:37,290
- But, it's a dark place
for these characters,

1756
00:51:37,290 --> 00:51:38,600
and I never judge them.

1757
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,971
I never looked at them
as any kind of a villain.

1758
00:51:41,971 --> 00:51:43,870
- You can't, can you?
- Yeah, at all.

1759
00:51:43,870 --> 00:51:46,220
So, that was a really big important part

1760
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:47,530
of doing the work.

1761
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:49,050
Is not judging those characters.

1762
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:50,492
Especially these ones.

1763
00:51:50,492 --> 00:51:52,520
And, you'll find out really soon why.

1764
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,161
