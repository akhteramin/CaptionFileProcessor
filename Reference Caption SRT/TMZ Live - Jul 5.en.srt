00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,640
- Welcome to TMZ Live, Harvey Levin here.

15
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,473
- Charles here.

16
00:00:46,473 --> 00:00:51,473
- Bill Cosby is giving lectures
behind bars on parenting,

17
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,233
on drug abuse, and on getting a job.

18
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,300
And he's drawing huge crowds.

19
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,030
- He is essentially, and extremely popular

20
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,130
motivational speaker in the prison

21
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:05,430
where he is serving his term.

22
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,750
- Now, this may sound crazy to you,

23
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,833
because Bill Cosby,

24
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,950
at the end of this trial
where he was convicted,

25
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,550
you know of drugging Andrea
Constand and assaulting her,

26
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,710
You would think that
people aren't listening

27
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:23,030
to Bill Cosby anymore, they are.

28
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,210
They are behind bars.

29
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,350
- And it's happening
multiple times a week.

30
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:27,870
This is three, four times a week,

31
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:31,300
and up to 100 prisoners will
elect to come to these things,

32
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,490
it's not a required or mandatory thing.

33
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:35,950
These guys are coming
to listen to him talk.

34
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,310
- And you know, Brandon and
I were talking about this,

35
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,530
that you think about,

36
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,710
what is it that's different between them

37
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,160
and people on the outside?

38
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,720
And you know, people in prison,

39
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,240
especially if they've
been there a long time,

40
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,980
they are locked into the Cosby show.

41
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:51,813
- Right.

42
00:01:51,813 --> 00:01:54,070
- And didn't necessarily connect to--

43
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:54,930
- But they know why he's there.

44
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,870
- They do indeed, but it
doesn't seem to matter

45
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,580
the way it matters on the outside.

46
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,200
- Brad, do we know if,
is he like acknowledging:

47
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,190
Look I've made mistakes,
is that part of his--

48
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,570
- He has maintained his innocence
through this whole thing,

49
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,370
and actually to the Cosby show part,

50
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:13,450
his rep told us whenever
he's there to visit Bill,

51
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,130
a lot of the prisoners still refer to him

52
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,030
as their dad or their father figure,

53
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,730
and that's I think,
also part of why they're

54
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:19,830
listening to him here.

55
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,330
- And you know there are people, you know,

56
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,490
who commit certain crimes in prison,

57
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,060
or commit certain crimes in the outside,

58
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,130
and when they come in they're
looked on with disfavor.

59
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,900
It is the opposite with Bill Cosby.

60
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,460
- [Commentator] Yeah, I mean, it's dicey.

61
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,293
I mean--
- Yeah.

62
00:02:36,293 --> 00:02:37,560
- In this particular case,

63
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,540
it's dicey for a lot
of reasons, number one:

64
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,940
The crimes of Bill Cosby,
a big deal I've heard,

65
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,040
heinous and deplorable, right?

66
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,690
At the same time, there are still people

67
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,490
that look at him with a certain affinity,

68
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:52,490
and up until those
crimes were made public,

69
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,840
he was an insanely successful person.

70
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,080
So if you're going to,

71
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,200
in a vacuum, if you're
gonna listen to somebody

72
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,610
on how to become successful,

73
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,840
or things that you need
to do to reclaim success,

74
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,840
or start some of your own,

75
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,250
he wouldn't be a bad guy to listen to

76
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,167
besides all of the other
stuff you don't wanna hear

77
00:03:10,167 --> 00:03:11,520
that's coming out of his mouth.

78
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,870
So, if you're inside, you
might look at it differently.

79
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,930
- So Brad, in terms of the substance

80
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,170
of what he's talking about with parenting,

81
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,950
I think he's talking about re-bonding.

82
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,150
- Yeah, because a lot of
the guys that he speaks to

83
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,940
are going to be out on parole soon.

84
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,630
So they've lost time with their kids

85
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,050
so it's about re-bonding with
your family and your children

86
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,050
when you get out.

87
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,650
And it's also about how
to interview for jobs,

88
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,870
and go find work right away
so that you're provided

89
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,903
opportunities that don't
land you back behind bars.

90
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,890
- [Harvey] It's interesting that--

91
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,730
- It's not that what he's saying,

92
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,410
what he's saying, I'm sure there's,

93
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,132
clearly there's value in it.
- Yeah.

94
00:03:46,132 --> 00:03:48,300
- There's value in it,
and a lot of these men

95
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,307
he's speaking to in there
can learn something from it

96
00:03:51,307 --> 00:03:53,180
and from him.

97
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,790
It's just weird that it's coming from him

98
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:58,077
after what he was convicted of--

99
00:03:58,077 --> 00:03:59,070
- But I guess the question--
- I guess the question,

100
00:03:59,070 --> 00:03:59,903
when you're on the inside

101
00:03:59,903 --> 00:04:01,763
everybody has made--
- If not, a rue.

102
00:04:01,763 --> 00:04:03,140
Everyone's made a mistake.
- Everyone there has made

103
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,410
a mistake, clearly.
- Right.

104
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,910
- At the same time, you know, listen,

105
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:08,970
if you're incarcerated,

106
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,320
whatever it is that
you're incarcerated for,

107
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,600
you would hope that someone would spend

108
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,470
their time inside, incarcerated,

109
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:19,050
to try to do something positive.

110
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,310
Like anything, you know,

111
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,360
toothpaste you can
squeeze out of the tube.

112
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,610
I guess it's just a weird
thing coming from Bill Cosby

113
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:27,970
at this point with the ideas that we have

114
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,320
in our head about him right now.

115
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,740
- I just think it would
be less distasteful

116
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,670
if he were acknowledging some wrongdoing

117
00:04:36,733 --> 00:04:38,910
while teaching these lessons.

118
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:43,460
And because he isn't, it's
like if he's not contrite,

119
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,730
then for people on the outside,

120
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:49,490
it's just difficult to
hear him being a leader.

121
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,017
That's how I feel, that's what I think.

122
00:04:51,017 --> 00:04:54,250
That's why this story seems
weird to people I think.

123
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,910
- Hi, my name is Markeish Johnson,

124
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:58,460
and I am from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

125
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,280
And speaking about Bill Cosby,

126
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,220
I think it is very rare
for us on the outside

127
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,250
to hear of what Bill Cosby is doing,

128
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,420
however I think it is very
beneficial to the inmates

129
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,080
that are coming out on
parole, due to the fact that

130
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,660
you know, they're gonna
come back on the outside,

131
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,530
they're going to re-bond
with their families

132
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:19,170
and rebuild and try to
fit into that life again.

133
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:22,580
So, I think it is a good
idea for Bill to be doing

134
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,070
something of that,
while he's incarcerated,

135
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:28,554
but he also needs to admit
to his wrongdoings as well.

136
00:05:28,554 --> 00:05:31,630
(upbeat music)

137
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,800
- Mayor Pete Buttigieg is an incredibly,

138
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,410
we know he's very accomplished--

139
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:37,243
- [Harvey] Smart.

140
00:05:37,243 --> 00:05:40,113
- [Charles] Incredibly
smart guy, Road Scholar.

141
00:05:40,987 --> 00:05:42,010
- [Harvey] He speaks multiple languages

142
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,730
by the way.
- Speaks multiple languages,

143
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:47,730
which was on display in New York City.

144
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,610
- So he's walking down the street,

145
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:52,600
and this dude comes up to him,

146
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,350
and the guy is from Malta.

147
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:58,210
And he is actually, he is the president.

148
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:00,990
What's funny enough
it's a president-hopeful

149
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,030
meets a president.

150
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,870
He's the president of a Maltese club

151
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,660
in a store in New York.

152
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:10,450
So, (laughs) the guy starts
talking to Buttigieg,

153
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:14,007
and we're not gonna tell
you the whole thing--

154
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:17,470
- Here's a little bit.
- In Maltese, watch this.

155
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,673
- All right, my people, Maltese.

156
00:06:19,673 --> 00:06:23,590
(speaking in foreign language)

157
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,850
- [Charles] So you want to be President.

158
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:40,707
It's not the weather.

159
00:06:40,707 --> 00:06:41,810
- [Harvey] No, I don't know.

160
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,160
- [Charles] No, they're having a talk.

161
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,400
- [Harvey] I know, but what
are they talking about?

162
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,930
- [Charles] We know, because
we have Maltese spies.

163
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,970
- All right, so here's what I know,

164
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,250
that what the guy from Astoria is saying

165
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,853
is he's inviting Buttigieg--

166
00:06:53,853 --> 00:06:55,230
- [Charles] This is a rough translation.

167
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,510
- Well yeah, I talked to somebody.

168
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:01,733
So he invited Buttigieg
to come speak at the

169
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,860
club that he runs in
Astoria, and then decided

170
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,160
to sweeten the pot by
saying that if you show up,

171
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,250
we're gonna give you,
help me out with the name

172
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,483
of this thing, the can, it's a dessert.

173
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,650
What's the name of it again?

174
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,750
- It is called, I don't know.

175
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,960
Oh here it is, pastizzi.

176
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,210
- Pastizzi.
- Pastizzi.

177
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,780
- Which is a, it's kind of like a cannoli

178
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,493
with a soft crust on it.

179
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,736
I believe it's ricotta cheese inside.

180
00:07:30,736 --> 00:07:33,366
But they ended up talking
- That doesn't sound

181
00:07:33,366 --> 00:07:34,199
like a dessert.
- And it turns out

182
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,573
that Buttigieg was asking this guy,

183
00:07:38,005 --> 00:07:39,310
where he was from.
- Where his family was from

184
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,143
in Malta.

185
00:07:40,143 --> 00:07:43,110
- And then Buttigieg said
that his grandparents

186
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:46,830
were in a nearby town,
and they live next door

187
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:50,417
to a guy named Anton
Buttigieg, not related to him.

188
00:07:50,417 --> 00:07:52,100
- Not related, but they're the same--

189
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,260
- Became president of Malta.

190
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,610
So, Buttigieg is like Smith

191
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,510
in Malta.
- In Malta.

192
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,110
- Because there are a lot
of people named Buttigieg,

193
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,100
which I didn't know either,

194
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,090
so it's kind of interesting.
- Another thing

195
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,790
that we learned here,

196
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:06,830
first of all we should say
in addition to Maltese,

197
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:10,210
Mayor Pete also speaks
Italian, French, Norwegian,

198
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,480
Spanish.
- Spanish.

199
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,990
- [Commentator] He's read
books in those foreign

200
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,690
languages too, like he
doesn't just speak though,

201
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,170
like he really knows them.

202
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,577
- [Charles] And he also
speaks some Arabic, anyway.

203
00:08:18,577 --> 00:08:20,123
- [Harvey] So, I was just interested--

204
00:08:20,123 --> 00:08:20,977
- The other thing we learned is,

205
00:08:20,977 --> 00:08:22,480
and we should say this
'cause I don't wanna make

206
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,280
the assumption that everyone knows

207
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,640
where Malta is, Malta is a small island

208
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,910
in the Mediterranean, and it's basically

209
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:34,230
between Africa and the
end of the Italian boot.

210
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,320
- Thank you for that.

211
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,460
- Some people think that it's
near Greece for some reason.

212
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,330
- It is near Greece.

213
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,600
- It's not near Greece.
- Well it is near Greece.

214
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,337
- It's near to Africa.
- It is near Greece.

215
00:08:41,337 --> 00:08:42,170
- It's very near to Africa.
- I didn't say nearer,

216
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:43,696
I said near Greece.
- Tunisia, Tunisia,

217
00:08:43,696 --> 00:08:45,100
that's where it is.
- It is near

218
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:45,933
Greece.
- Look on a map, folks.

219
00:08:45,933 --> 00:08:46,766
- Look on a map

220
00:08:46,766 --> 00:08:47,599
and you'll see.
- And you'll understand that--

221
00:08:47,599 --> 00:08:49,050
- You will see that it's near Greece.

222
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:49,883
- And we're done.

223
00:08:49,883 --> 00:08:51,110
- Hi, this is Glorashtee,

224
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:53,120
I'm calling from Chesapeake, Virginia.

225
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,450
Mayor Pete is going to sneak up on us all.

226
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:59,670
He has the unique ability
to bond and blend,

227
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,940
and connect genuinely
with just about everyone.

228
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,857
And he's only like what, 19 (laughs).

229
00:09:06,599 --> 00:09:08,199
- You got some millennial shade?

230
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,580
- It might a bit. (laughs)

231
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,070
It might a bit.

232
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,595
- Look, I think what's
really fascinating about him,

233
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:18,810
we gotta move on, is that
he is a true intellectual.

234
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:22,250
And, it's interesting that, you know,

235
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,273
how America receives that
- Receives that--

236
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:25,900
- I think they're gonna receive it well.

237
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,020
- Right, instead of--

238
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,630
- Because you also can relate to people.

239
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,610
- Right, what you're saying
is that there's always

240
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:33,350
the chance that some people
feel alienated from that,

241
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,270
that like you're--

242
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,600
- You know who'd change that?

243
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,147
- Who?
- James Holzhauer.

244
00:09:37,147 --> 00:09:39,026
- Oh, there you go.
(Harvey laughing)

245
00:09:39,026 --> 00:09:41,580
(upbeat music)

246
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,330
Let's get some dancing in.

247
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:44,340
Very real dancing.

248
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,283
Beyonce and Jay Z's little
girl's all grown up.

249
00:09:47,283 --> 00:09:49,600
- Well she's seven.
- She's seven,

250
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,230
but that's old enough

251
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,773
to be the star of a dance recital.

252
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:57,530
Blue Ivy attends Debbie
Allen's Dance Academy,

253
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,513
here in the LA area.

254
00:09:58,513 --> 00:10:00,410
I think it's in Inglewood, actually.

255
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:03,200
And she had a recital
and was doing her thing.

256
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,200
She actually also--

257
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,033
- [Harvey] She's good.

258
00:10:05,033 --> 00:10:06,010
- [Charles] Yeah, she looks good.

259
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:08,580
Now she did this, but
there was another time

260
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,217
when she's performing to
one of Beyonce's songs,

261
00:10:11,217 --> 00:10:13,340
"Before I Let Go", and--

262
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,440
- She's really good.
- Which has gotta be,

263
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,560
I don't know, is that weird for her?

264
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,550
Well I guess, my mom.
- No, it's not weird for her

265
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,300
because they probably play the song

266
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,170
all the time in the house.

267
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:24,440
She probably listens to the
radio, it's always on the radio.

268
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,390
And kids love that song,

269
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,500
everybody loves that song right now.

270
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,540
Like, there's a huge viral
"Before I Let Go" challenge

271
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,420
that I'm sure she does at home
in her mirror with her mom,

272
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,177
so it feels like at home,
and she's killing it, so.

273
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:37,340
- [Harvey] Do the other
kids think it's weird, then?

274
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,490
- [Commentator] No, they're kids.

275
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:39,760
They're like six years old.
- Why don't we just let

276
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,030
these babies dance.

277
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,493
- My niece loves this song.

278
00:10:42,493 --> 00:10:43,430
(man laughs)
- Let these babies dance.

279
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,813
- But Beyonce redid this song

280
00:10:44,813 --> 00:10:45,646
and brought it back for
- Hey, hey.

281
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:46,718
Uncle Van, Uncle Van.
- a whole other generation.

282
00:10:46,718 --> 00:10:48,020
- Easy Uncle Van, okay.

283
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,544
- What you saying, man,
it's a bunch of kids.

284
00:10:49,544 --> 00:10:50,522
Is it weird for 'em?
(Harvey and Charles laughing)

285
00:10:50,522 --> 00:10:52,816
Let these babies dance, man.
- Let these babies dance.

286
00:10:52,816 --> 00:10:53,650
(men laughing)

287
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:54,650
- [Charles] Fine, okay.

288
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,150
Dance babies, go ahead.

289
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,600
- God, can we take a break?
(men laughing)

290
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,470
Oh my god.
- Yes please, let's do this.

291
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:03,053
(upbeat music)

292
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,205
- [Kyler] It's something I've
dreamed of my whole life.

293
00:11:06,205 --> 00:11:07,107

310

But one blows them

to your fabulous house, only to discover--

359
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,334
- [Harvey] This is mind-boggling.

360
00:13:48,334 --> 00:13:50,230
- [Charles] That's a good
word, mind boggling--

361
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,740
- So she literally, there's a guy

362
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,020
who tried to steal Halle Berry's house.

363

Steal her whole damn house.

364
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:00,000
- Yup, how in the world do you pull off

365
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,833
something like that?

366
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:02,040
- Well he figure out a way.

367
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,650
- Yes, police say this is how a guy named

368
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,970
Ronald Eugene Griffin (laughs)

369
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:07,940
tried to do it.

370
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,230
- [Commentator] This
is such a crazy story.

371
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,050
- [Charles] It's so, it's actually simple.

372
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,800
- [Harvey] It starts with a locksmith.

373
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,490
- So this guy firstly comes
back to the house in January

374
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:16,560
and tries to fiddle with the locks,

375
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,393
and the gardener comes, he goes,

376
00:14:17,393 --> 00:14:18,226
"What are you doing here?"

377
00:14:18,226 --> 00:14:19,059
And he takes off.

378
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:21,290
He comes back later, like a month later.

379
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,340
He comes back with a locksmith

380
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,870
and they start working
on the outside locks,

381
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,480
and they get one of the locks changed.

382
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,177
And someone from the house
who works there goes,

383
00:14:27,177 --> 00:14:28,180
"Hey, what are you doing?"

384
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,567
He goes, "Oh, I'm the
new owner of the house,

385
00:14:29,567 --> 00:14:31,090
"I have the deed here".

386
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:32,297
The person from the house says,

387
00:14:32,297 --> 00:14:33,680
"Well I'm gonna call the cops."

388
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,060
Well this guy goes, "Well
I'm gonna call the cops too".

389
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:36,893
- [Harvey] Because I have the deed.

390
00:14:36,893 --> 00:14:38,730
- Yeah, I mean this is so crazy.

391
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:39,930
- So the person who's lived,

392
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:42,580
this is one of Halle's
homes in the L.A. area,

393
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,760
it's not, apparently not her main home.

394
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,593
- [Harvey] But, but--

395
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,120
- [Charles] If there's a staff, again,

396
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,810
at that point right there, then to me

397
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,290
that's where an alarm should have gone off

398
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,960
that the staff, or whoever
was there at the house

399
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,009
might make a call to
Halle Berry or somebody--

400
00:14:57,009 --> 00:14:59,180
- I think they did call
her, they called the police,

401
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,370
and then eventually this guy,
they investigated, this guy

402
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,525
ended up being arrested.
- So they started looking

403
00:15:02,525 --> 00:15:04,000
at this guy.

404
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,700
But the guy actually forged the deed.

405
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,737
- [Commentator] Right, forged the deed,

406
00:15:07,737 --> 00:15:09,610
and this is more common
than you believe now.

407
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,530
There's a whole division
that deals just with this.

408
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:12,540
People are doing this.

409
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,373
They'll steal a whole house,
they'll go and change the deed.

410
00:15:14,373 --> 00:15:16,125
- And one of the problems with this

411
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,700
is if you think about it,
and this has been a big thing

412
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,590
in California and in
a lot of other states,

413
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:22,220
where elderly people especially,

414
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,630
they get taken advantage of,

415
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,960
and it's done in various ways where they,

416
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,537
you know, a roofer will come
and say, "Hey, you know what,

417
00:15:28,537 --> 00:15:30,540
"sign this contract, and
we'll put a new roof on,"

418
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,780
and they end up foreclosing.

419
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:34,601
But this is way more bold but--

420
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:35,840
- Yeah, this is, I mean it's shocking

421
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,280
having to steal a whole house.
- But if somebody doesn't

422
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,430
have the staff to fight back,

423
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,164
like "Get out, it's my house now".

424
00:15:41,164 --> 00:15:42,610
- Yeah, I mean if it's a
rental house or something,

425
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:43,443
you go there and they're like, "No."

426
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:44,970
And then you gotta go through the process

427
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,290
of evicting them, and
getting them out legally

428
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:47,570
and they could be there for a while.

429
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:50,300
- So remember, Halle Berry has had issues

430
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,150
with, you know, intruders in her home.

431
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:55,340
I don't know if you remember
but four or five years ago,

432
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,500
she literally came back to her house,

433
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,040
got in the kitchen, looked
out the glass window

434
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,830
in the kitchen and
there's a guy facing her

435
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:05,110
on her property staring at her

436
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,810
who's trying to get inside the house.

437
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:09,310
And it was somebody who
apparently had been persistent.

438
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,560
So she's had these problems before.

439
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,920
- Correct.
- But apparently the guy

440
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,973
didn't know it was Halle Berry's house.

441
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,240
- No, I mean this house was under a trust,

442
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,630
so he had no idea, it's just random luck

443
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,890
that it was Halle's, or unlucky for Halle.

444
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,663
- Bad luck, bad luck for him also.

445
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,400
- He got arrested.
- He got arrested.

446
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,480
- Hey, I'm Ariel Jones
from Atlanta, Georgia.

447
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,910
I think that it's just so weird

448
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:32,060
that you find another person in your home,

449
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,852
especially Halle Berry, and it's like

450
00:16:35,852 --> 00:16:39,045
how he'd think that he
would get away with that.

451
00:16:39,045 --> 00:16:40,970
- [Harvey] That's actually
a really good question.

452
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,120
- [Charles] Well that's
what I was gonna say,

453
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,850
like I can't imagine how he did,

454
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,643
but the fact that he
did this makes you think

455
00:16:45,643 --> 00:16:48,380
that he probably did actually
pull this off at some point.

456
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,650
- This is such an important point.

457
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,840
My dad owned a liquor store,

458
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,510
and I don't remember what happened,

459
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,704
but we always used to say

460
00:16:54,704 --> 00:16:57,570
that bank robbers don't
start robbing banks,

461
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:59,810
they start stealing
candy at liquor stores.

462
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,730
- Correct.
- And then they graduate up.

463
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,940
So to go to a really
nice house where you know

464
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,070
there are employees there.
- He probably pulled it off

465
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,480
with a smaller house.
- That's right.

466
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,720
- They're worth less.
- 100%.

467
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,890
And you're just wondering how
many times has this happened,

468
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:16,230
and are they getting, you
know, people who are struggling

469
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,197
out of their house and saying,

470
00:17:17,197 --> 00:17:19,300
"Go, go, you're gone, it's my house now."

471
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,700
And they do it.

472
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,360
I mean it's crazy.

473
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,595
Okay, we're gonna move on.

474
00:17:23,595 --> 00:17:26,588
(upbeat music)

475
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:28,780
- We got some video now of a huge brawl

476
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,270
that broke out,

477
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,103
I guess it's not a huge brawl,

478
00:17:31,103 --> 00:17:32,230
it's only two people.
- It's a brawl.

479
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,950
- But man it was vicious.

480
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:37,460
On a New York City street
corner, this is in SoHo,

481
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:41,370
two women for various reasons,

482
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:44,640
according to witnesses,
just started going at it

483
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,220
until a Hollywood actor
named Peter Greene,

484
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,710
you know him from "Pulp Fiction",

485
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,520
you know him from "The Mask".

486
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,353
He plays--
- He's a pretty good actor.

487
00:17:52,353 --> 00:17:54,170
- Yeah, he's played the
villain in a lot of things.

488
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:56,320
He played Zed in "Pulp Fiction".

489
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,890
But he happened to walk by

490
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,250
while everyone else was
watching what was going on--

491
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,083
- Jumped into action.

492
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:03,916
- He jumped in.

493
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,108
(women shouting)

494
00:18:06,108 --> 00:18:09,025
(car horn honking)

495
00:18:12,673 --> 00:18:14,673
(beeps)

496
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,660
(beeps)

497
00:18:20,571 --> 00:18:21,731
- Stop fighting!

498
00:18:21,731 --> 00:18:23,075
Just calm down, just calm down.

499
00:18:23,075 --> 00:18:25,185
Hey, hey, no, stop fighting!

500
00:18:25,185 --> 00:18:26,306
Stop hurting her!

501
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:28,103
Stop hurting her with the rag!

502
00:18:28,103 --> 00:18:29,006
(beeps)

503
00:18:29,006 --> 00:18:31,421
- Yo, stop hurting--
(beeps)

504
00:18:31,421 --> 00:18:32,903
- Stop it, stop it!

505
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,519
Stop it!

506
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:36,519
(beeps)

507
00:18:38,054 --> 00:18:40,564
Why can't you two stop it,
what's the matter with you?

508
00:18:40,564 --> 00:18:41,951
You let 'em fight?

509
00:18:41,951 --> 00:18:43,897
You're a grown man, what the (beeps).

510
00:18:43,897 --> 00:18:44,730
No, tell you!

511
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,770
Stop the fighting between two women.

512
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:47,603
What's the matter with you?

513
00:18:47,603 --> 00:18:48,668
- [Pedestrian] How come he didn't stop it.

514
00:18:48,668 --> 00:18:49,795
- (beeps) Stop it.

515
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,627
(car horn honking)
(people chattering)

516
00:18:51,627 --> 00:18:52,478
- [Charles] You could see at the end there

517
00:18:52,478 --> 00:18:53,947
Peter was ticked off.
- Grief with Peter Greene.

518
00:18:53,947 --> 00:18:56,750
- The people he was yelling
at are New York City

519
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,561
traffic agents who were
standing on the corner.

520
00:18:58,561 --> 00:18:59,460
- And just watching it.

521
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,410
- And watching it happen,

522
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,020
so he was chastising them.
- Good for him.

523
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,640
- You can understand why he'd be mad.

524
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,520
I mean, isn't that their
job to keep the peace?

525
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,597
Why are they just standing
there watching two girls beat

526
00:19:07,597 --> 00:19:09,750
the hell out of each other?
- Well, yeah, I mean, look,

527
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,400
they do work for NYPD,
they're not actual officers,

528
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,140
they're traffic agents,
but they do work for NYPD.

529
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,560
- [Harvey] There's a problem,
and you know it's interesting

530
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,700
'cause Peter, you know,
these bikes are not cheap.

531
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,260
And Peter just kind of

532
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,340
throw down his bike.
- Well no.

533
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,230
- [Harvey] Well yeah, I
mean it's pretty valiant

534
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,063
when he did it.

535
00:19:26,063 --> 00:19:27,340
- [Commentator] All the
human trauma happening

536
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,781
and Harvey's not listening.
- Harvey's looking at how

537
00:19:28,781 --> 00:19:29,614
expensive that bike is.
- I'm concerned

538
00:19:29,614 --> 00:19:30,447
about that bike.
(men laughing)

539
00:19:30,447 --> 00:19:31,980
- [Harvey] No, I'm just
saying it's a marker

540
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,533
of how he's stepped in, he
was such a good Samaritan.

541
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:35,823
I think it just adds to--

542
00:19:35,823 --> 00:19:36,920
- [Commentator] Stop right there, Pete,

543
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,070
you don't wanna pick up a charge yourself.

544
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:40,382
- [Charles] Right. (laughing)

545
00:19:40,382 --> 00:19:41,215
Good for him.

546
00:19:41,215 --> 00:19:42,130
- It is good to step in.

547
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:42,963
But I don't know, Tim,
- Well you wanna

548
00:19:42,963 --> 00:19:45,410
see the side of her face--
- The traffic people,

549
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,690
I don't know if they're like,

550
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,210
if that's part of their job description,

551
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:49,434
they give out tickets, right?
- It's probably not.

552
00:19:49,434 --> 00:19:51,303
Yeah I know, but you know.

553
00:19:51,303 --> 00:19:53,050
- I think if the fight had spilled over

554
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:55,210
into the crosswalk,
then it affects traffic,

555
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:56,283
then they would get involved.

556
00:19:56,283 --> 00:19:57,190
I'm guessing, but I--

557
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,650
- [Commentator] Or they could
just be decent human beings.

558
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:00,880
- [Harvey] Well, yes.

559
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,713
- [Commentator] Wait,
hold on, hold on, hold on,

560
00:20:01,713 --> 00:20:02,546
stop, stop, stop.

561
00:20:02,546 --> 00:20:05,250
So a decent human being puts themselves--

562
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,083
- [Harvey] Yeah, at risk.

563
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:06,916
- [Commentator] At risk
to get in the middle

564
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,000
of somebody fighting?

565
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,891
- [Harvey] And someone's spitting, also.

566
00:20:09,891 --> 00:20:12,010
I don't know about that man.

567
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:12,930
- [Commentator] Obviously,
y'all never really been

568
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:14,240
around that bit fighting.

569
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,610
You let them go 'til they tired.

570
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:16,530
- Yeah, there's a difference

571
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:19,530
between being a good Samaritan
and not being decent.

572
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:22,790
I mean, look, people don't
wanna get involved, it happens.

573
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,540
But, I mean, good for Peter Greene.

574
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,370
- Good for Peter Greene is
what we should be sayin'.

575
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:27,270
Don't shame everybody else,

576
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,110
Peter Greene did something heroic.

577
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:32,050
- I'm Victoria Brownlee from
Greensboro, North Carolina.

578
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:34,480
And I must say that
video was pretty amazing,

579
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,600
he did it just so effortlessly,

580
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,050
and then put everybody else in his place.

581
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:41,685
His status just went up
10 notches in my opinion.

582
00:20:41,685 --> 00:20:43,341
- All right.
- Okay, and we're moving on.

583
00:20:43,341 --> 00:20:46,230
(upbeat music)

584
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:48,527
- Okay, wanna hear about a cool cat?

585
00:20:48,527 --> 00:20:50,450
- (laughs) A real cool cat
is gonna make a lot of money,

586
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,403
at least that is the plan.

587
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,290
You guys know Benjamin Button, right?

588
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:58,040
Not the movie character,
but more importantly

589
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,300
Taylor Swift's feline.

590
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,420
- Yes, her third cat,

591
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:05,380
her newest cat added to the
family earlier this year,

592
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,960
is now officially part of the gang,

593
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,670
because she has added
Benjamin to her trademark.

594
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:12,890
Now, last year she had,

595
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:14,900
how do you get Benjamin
Button as a trademark?

596
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,610
- She got a--
- Well it's Meredith,

597
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:19,090
Olivia and Benjamin Swift.

598
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:20,434
So that's the difference,

599
00:21:20,434 --> 00:21:21,376
and now she's gonna--
- It's almost like

600
00:21:21,376 --> 00:21:22,370
Benjamin Button is a nickname,

601
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:24,237
but his trademark name
- Oh, his government name

602
00:21:24,237 --> 00:21:25,870
- is Swift.
- is Benjamin Swift.

603
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:27,404
- Yes.
- I got it.

604
00:21:27,404 --> 00:21:28,751
(laughing)

605
00:21:28,751 --> 00:21:32,550
- Yeah, so Taylor added Benjamin
to the trademark she had--

606
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,800
- [Harvey] Has she done
anything with the other cats

607
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,310
in terms of marketing anything?

608
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:37,410
- Yes she has, Meredith

609
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:38,820
and then the other one, Olivia,

610
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,960
have been like all over T-Shirts
and everything like that.

611
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,210
So she has already been
selling all that merch,

612
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:47,750
and now with him, I
mean it's just gonna be

613
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,583
even more cuter.

614
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:52,380
And she wants to do like
cellphone cases, luggage,

615
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,390
I mean there's so much
opportunity for this guy,

616
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:58,040
and you guys, with
grumpy cat passing away,

617
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,050
the cat community

618
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:00,325
is heartbroken.
- There's a hole

619
00:22:00,325 --> 00:22:02,110
in the market, yeah.
- There is absolutely

620
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,910
a spot for a new cat to
come in and take over.

621
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:06,650
- You know that Benjamin's not actually

622
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:07,673
gonna make any money, right?

623
00:22:07,673 --> 00:22:09,010
Like the money all goes

624
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:10,680
to Taylor.
- No, you're kidding me!

625
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,683
- Well, I've just seen, we
wanted to let Charlie know,

626
00:22:13,683 --> 00:22:15,182
because she sounded pretty excited about

627
00:22:15,182 --> 00:22:16,250
opportunities for Benjamin.
- You guys, maybe it's not

628
00:22:17,667 --> 00:22:20,530
about the money for him,
maybe he just wants the fame.

629
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:21,870
- See, that's why I needed Florida.

630
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,370
- Yeah, he's a clot chaser,

631
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:24,520

00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:25,070
Getting around isn't as
easy as it used to be.

657
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,780
That's why we called Bath Fitter.

658
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,390
They removed our old tub,

659
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:30,910
and installed a beautiful
new spacious shower.

660

And, we have peace of
mind with seamless walls

- [Narrator] Call today
for this month's offer.

667
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:50,210
- Duke's is far and away
my favorite mayonnaise,

668
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:52,080
and it has been for as
long as I can remember.

669
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,420
It tastes homemade, but it's
better than I could make.

670
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,850
- [Katie] For any potato
salad, you have to have mayo,

671
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,140
and we might as well start with the best.

672
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,860
- And it's Duke's.
- And it's Duke's. (laughing)

673
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,030
- Really good!

674
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:04,230
- The fact that they use real egg yolks,

675
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:06,430
and there's no added sugar,

676
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:08,343
you can actually taste them.

677
00:24:08,343 --> 00:24:09,660
(crunching)

678
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,730

good, yeah, yeah, yeah.

(people laughing)

707

- [Narrator] It's TMZ.

00:25:16,936 --> 00:25:19,519
(upbeat music)

709
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:23,240
- Welcome back to TMZ Live.

710
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,500
Most of the faces are the same,

711
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,760
but man have their lives
changed dramatically.

712
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,740
Talking about the cast of "The Hills".

713
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:33,840
The reboot "The Hills:
New Beginnings" on MTV.

714
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,810
And yes, you will see a
lot of faces that you know,

715
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,450
A couple of faces that are new.

716
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:39,920
- [Harvey] They've had a decade to grow.

717
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,200
- Yeah.
- And change.

718
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,610
And what's interesting
is, everybody thought

719
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:45,690
Heidi and Spencer was only
for the cameras back then.

720
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:47,944
Remember, it was 2006 to 2010.

721
00:25:47,944 --> 00:25:49,858
And there was a come
on, Heidi and Spencer,

722
00:25:49,858 --> 00:25:50,691
they're together.

723
00:25:50,691 --> 00:25:52,000
- Still together.
- They're married.

724
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,510
- Married, and yeah,
there's that little guy

725
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:57,510
who is on the show, which is interesting

726
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:01,070
because we know that having
kids on reality shows--

727
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:01,903
- Problematic.

728
00:26:01,903 --> 00:26:02,736
- Can be problematic.

729
00:26:02,736 --> 00:26:05,520
So joining us right now
to talk about all of that

730
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,910
is Spencer Pratt.

731
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:07,810
- [Harvey] Hey Spencer, sir.

732
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:08,643
- [Charles] Welcome back to TMZ Live,

733
00:26:08,643 --> 00:26:10,140
how you doin', man?

734
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,350
- Oh my god, whoa.

735
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:13,490
Can I see your guys' faces, I can't see

736
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:15,311
my big head like that.

737
00:26:15,311 --> 00:26:16,523
- Where are you?
- Where are you?

738
00:26:16,523 --> 00:26:18,120
That's beautiful.
- That looks awesome.

739
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,150
- That is Crested Butte mountains.

740
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:22,710
- Ah, Colorado!
- This is where I grew up.

741
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,908
We're visiting her family, oh my god.

742
00:26:24,908 --> 00:26:25,741
- [Charles] Montana?

743
00:26:25,741 --> 00:26:26,574
- [Harvey] No, Colorado.

744
00:26:26,574 --> 00:26:29,030
- Colorado.
- Crested Butte, Colorado.

745
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,070
I didn't know if it was Colorado.

746
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:30,903
God it's beautiful there.

747
00:26:30,903 --> 00:26:32,060
- Isn't it though, yeah.

748
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,050
- [Harvey] Holy smokes.

749
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,521
- It's unreal I was
wondering if you wanted

750
00:26:34,521 --> 00:26:35,410
to enjoy the view.

751
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:36,550
- Well we appreciate that.

752
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:38,280
So listen man, because it's been a decade,

753
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,320
and there were no, when
you guys were partying

754
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,580
in Hollywood back then,

755
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,955
nobody was bringing baby strollers.

756
00:26:44,955 --> 00:26:45,788
- Yeah!

757
00:26:45,788 --> 00:26:49,980
- [Charles] Or car seats, so
how's this gonna work out?

758
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:53,140
- That was a big drama thing for my wife,

759
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,710
because she is an attachment parent.

760
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:56,280
So the first part of The Hill,

761
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:00,010
she doesn't really go out,
and she's having serious,

762
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:03,430
I would say emotional
breakdowns just leaving our son.

763
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:05,830
'Cause for the first year
she never left Gunner

764
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,000
for longer than a minute,

765
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,170
which is amazing, but is
was also very challenging,

766
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,900
so thankfully for "The
Hills", she gets to a point

767
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:16,330
where she can go out and be a regular mom,

768
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:18,410
that is fun, and has a drink.

769
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:21,330
But, that was very challenging initially.

770
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:23,430
- Okay, I got a question because that,

771
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,850
I didn't know this.

772
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:28,760
So, this sounds like a,
was she preventing you

773
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,510
from parenting because she
was doing it all the time?

774
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:34,371
That's what I'm hearing.
- No, no I was there,

775
00:27:34,371 --> 00:27:38,220
I could leave the house, she
was way more like extreme.

776
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,480
Obviously, Gunner didn't
come out of my body,

777
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,550
so I imagine that connection's
a little bit more intense

778
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:46,470
than, you know, my connection.

779
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:48,658
- That's a fair assessment
probably, yeah (laughing).

780
00:27:48,658 --> 00:27:51,010
- So what about, you've
heard about Rob Kardashian

781
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:53,190
and Blac Chyna arguing over
whether their kid can go

782
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,820
on a reality show, and whatnot.

783
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:59,290
Do you have any like
trepidations about Gunner--

784
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:00,640
- Yeah, did you guys talk about it?

785
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,670
- Sometimes it doesn't end well.

786
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:04,160
- What was the conversation
like before you made

787
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,680
the decision about having him on?

788
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,700
- All due respect to Rob and Blac Chyna,

789
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,460
but we've been together 12 years,

790
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,739
so our relationship's a little stronger

791
00:28:11,739 --> 00:28:15,010
(Charles laughs)
than those two, which you know

792
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:17,260
I hope I--
- That's not shade,

793
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,230
those are facts.

794
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,470
- Yeah, yeah, so I think
that's the difference.

795
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:23,755
We're very aware of what reality TV does,

796
00:28:23,755 --> 00:28:27,110
and if Gunner initially had
not enjoyed the process,

797
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:29,110
and you know, didn't like people,

798
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:29,943
we wouldn't have done it.

799
00:28:29,943 --> 00:28:31,740
But he would cry when they would leave.

800
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,790
He would be trying to hold the boom mics,

801
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:37,200
and it was like fun, almost
like an adventure for him, so.

802
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,170
You know, he's more like an Asahd,

803
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:42,000
he's like DJ Khaled's son,
they were born for it.

804
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,550
- Okay Spencer, we're gonna play a game.

805
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:46,130
This is total fantasy land.

806
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:48,540
Pretend I'm 19 years old,

807
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,820
and I'm trying to figure out
- Okay, what is going on here?

808
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,560
- what I'm gonna watch tonight,

809
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,780
and I'm thinking, wait a minute,

810
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:58,090
these folks are married
now, they got a kid.

811
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:00,780
I wanna see people
partying and doing whatnot,

812
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,890
what they did in the OG, so--

813
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:06,596
- Wooh, I got you Mister
19-year-old Harvey Levin.

814
00:29:06,596 --> 00:29:08,600
(men laughing)
Okay, let me tell you about

815
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,010
Brandon Thomas Lee,

816
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:15,010
the son of Tommy Lee, the
son of Pamela Anderson.

817
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,980
He just turned 22.

818
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,670
He is the King of Hollywood.

819
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:20,520
The guy has more dates

820
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,430
than anybody I've ever seen in my life.

821
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:24,020
He's got breaking hearts,

822
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:27,913
he's a freaking supermodel,
walking runways.

823
00:29:29,208 --> 00:29:31,610
Real talk, he's cooler
than any of us ever were

824
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:33,840
when we were on "The
Hills", he's the next level.

825
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,310
So he's bringing that
19-year-old interest.

826
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:40,478
And then if you're one
of these older people--

827
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:41,390
(Harvey laughing)
- More seasoned,

828
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:42,455
more seasoned.

829
00:29:42,455 --> 00:29:44,520
- Yeah, or better, but I will say

830
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,790
that one thing about being a parent is

831
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:49,750
when you do get to go out,
like I was allowed out

832
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:50,911
two nights a week.

833
00:29:50,911 --> 00:29:53,277
(Harvey and Charles laugh)
I party harder than

834
00:29:53,277 --> 00:29:55,570
any 21-year-old could ever party,

835
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:59,470
'cause I'm like, "I'm
out of the house, ha!"

836
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:01,910
So I would say I drank and partied harder

837
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:04,730
than ever before on this season.

838
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:07,380
I was actually, like my
goal was to out-party

839
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,090
any of these other reality shows.

840
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:11,670
And I think I did it, I
was going to every scene

841
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:14,034
with two bottles of Don Julio, so.

842
00:30:14,034 --> 00:30:14,953
- Oh gosh!
- Excellent answers, Spencer.

843
00:30:14,953 --> 00:30:17,160
- All right.
- Excellent answer, yeah.

844
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,570
- Thank you, thank you.
- I think 19-year-old

845
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:19,460
Harvey is in.

846
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:22,085
- By the way, there
was once a 19-year-old.

847
00:30:22,085 --> 00:30:22,918
- I know.

848
00:30:22,918 --> 00:30:24,220
- Brandon is a superstar.

849
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:27,180
He cut out his own show on
MTV, just called "Brandon",

850
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,720
so he's our ringer.

851
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,553
- [Harvey] He is--

852
00:30:29,553 --> 00:30:30,833
- You gotta send in the ringer.

853
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:35,520
- Okay, Spencer
congratulations, it's amazing.

854
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,880
You guys endured the show,

855
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,420
endured, it's amazing.

856
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,740
- Thank you Harvey, I
will tell this now finally

857
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,935
feels real to talk to you again,

858
00:30:42,935 --> 00:30:43,890
I feel like I'm in a time machine.

859
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:46,110
- I know, this is crazy.
- It's like old times,

860
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,210
like old times.

861
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:51,740
- Spencer, congrats and send
the same regards to Heidi.

862
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,598
- [Charles] And Gunner.

863
00:30:52,598 --> 00:30:53,431
- And Gunner.
- All right, love you guys.

864
00:30:53,431 --> 00:30:54,940
- [Harvey] And Gunner.

865
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,440

00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:53,380
It may have been the, well
actually I'm gonna say

940
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,920
was the most menacing news:

941
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,980
O. J. Simpson saying
that he's got some people

942
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:01,248
to get even with, therefore
he's gonna join Twitter.

943
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:02,470
He made this big announcement

944
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:05,660
and then he now has a Twitter account,

945
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,890
and the first, I don't
know if this is someone

946
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:10,030
he feels he needs to get even with,

947
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:12,617
but the first thing he
chose to address was,

948
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,660
who is Khloe Kardashian's father.

949
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:19,870
This has been a long
held rumor that O. J.--

950
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:20,840
- Unsubstantiated.

951
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:25,840
- Yes, that O. J. is
Khloe's dad, and I think,

952
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,965
Kris has addressed this
- The family just poo-pooed it

953
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:29,210
- I think Khloe's addressed it, right.

954
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:30,130
- They just said come on.

955
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:32,780
- But O. J. wanted to
give his two cents on it.

956
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,287
Here's what he said and
pay close attention--

957
00:34:34,287 --> 00:34:35,990
- The way he says it.

958
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:38,400
- It's not so much even
Khloe, it's what he's saying

959
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,760
about Kris.
- Kris.

960
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,400
- Bob Kardashian, he's
like a brother to me,

961
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,360
he's a great guy.

962
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,560
He met and married Kris, they really had

963
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,760
a terrific time together
when they were together.

964
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,460
Unfortunately that ended.

965
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:55,960
But never, and I wanna
stress never, in any way

966
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,510
shape or form had I ever
had any interest in Kris

967
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,470
romantically or sexually.

968
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:05,020
And I never got any indication
that she had any interest

969
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,950
in me, so all of these stories

970
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:10,633
are just bogus, bad, you know tasteless.

971
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,910
Khloe, like all the
girls, I'm very proud of,

972
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:17,700
just like I know Bob
would be if he was here.

973
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,923
But to simplify to the
matter, is she's not mine.

974
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,670
- This guy, he's so pathetic.

975
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:25,630
I mean he's just doing
this because the attention

976
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:27,250
was running low, and here we are again

977
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,870
talking about something
that we already knew

978
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:30,340
the answer to, but of course,

979
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:33,290
he just has to try and
lend his voice to it.

980
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:34,123
- [Both] Yeah.

981
00:35:34,123 --> 00:35:36,110
- I was actually, as I was
listening to what he was saying

982
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:38,527
what was the thing about
Kris, where he says,

983
00:35:38,527 --> 00:35:41,747
"Look I had no interest
in her whatsoever."

984
00:35:41,747 --> 00:35:43,550
He knows that she didn't
have any interest in him.

985
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:45,030
- Well no, but that's kind of incidental,

986
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:47,733
I mean the beginning is "I
had no interest in her."

987
00:35:47,733 --> 00:35:49,840
- Well I disagree that it's incidental,

988
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:54,040
he said it both ways, he
said "It didn't happen,

989
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:54,873
"I wasn't in to her".

990
00:35:54,873 --> 00:35:57,001
- [Harvey] And as far as I know.

991
00:35:57,001 --> 00:36:00,163
- "And she never told
me she was into me", so.

992
00:36:00,163 --> 00:36:04,093
- [Charles] It sounds odd,
but it seems honest from O. J.

993
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:09,322
- [Harvey] But why not just say
"Hey it just didn't happen"?

994
00:36:09,322 --> 00:36:10,155
- [Charles] I don't know.

995
00:36:10,155 --> 00:36:11,490
- [Commentator] Not
only did it not happen--

996
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:12,330
- [Harvey] Give me more proof!

997
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:13,163
- But what he's saying is,

998
00:36:13,163 --> 00:36:15,257
"Not only did it not happen that I'm not,

999
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:16,490
"it's just there was nothing
between us like that."

1000
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:17,930
It's not that there was some

1001
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:19,800
kind of flame that we never acted on,

1002
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,110
this was not a thing.

1003
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,128
- [Charles] Right.

1004
00:36:22,128 --> 00:36:23,160
(commentator mumbles)
- That would be enough.

1005
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,990
- The reason it just
feels weird is because,

1006
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:27,870
honestly it's O. J. just being honest.

1007
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:29,960
And that just feels weird.

1008
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,653
- It feels weird 'cause,
why are you on Twitter, dog?

1009
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:34,887
- As you were speaking I was just going,

1010
00:36:34,887 --> 00:36:36,550
"Wait, what is this end game here?"

1011
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:37,800
- It seems like--
- And you know what

1012
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,710
the end game has to be somehow, right?

1013
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:40,543
- What?
- For him, he thinks

1014
00:36:40,543 --> 00:36:41,376
it's money.
- Money.

1015
00:36:41,376 --> 00:36:43,860
- And somehow he's gonna
get a certain number

1016
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:46,420
of followers and that
somehow he's gonna be able

1017
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,840
to translate that into money.

1018
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,820
- If anybody should be willing to like,

1019
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,520
you know, cut their
losses and just go ahead

1020
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,677
and live out the rest of their life

1021
00:36:54,677 --> 00:36:57,290
and just virtual obscurity,
it should be O. J.

1022
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:58,123
- It should be O. J.

1023
00:36:58,123 --> 00:36:59,960
Don't be trying to get
like a professional deal.

1024
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:03,528
- You could have made that
argument after the murder trial.

1025
00:37:03,528 --> 00:37:05,227
- Yes.
- And it just, you know--

1026
00:37:05,227 --> 00:37:08,280
- But he refused to, and
you know where it got him.

1027
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,163
- Hi, my name is Erica
Chestane, I'm from Georgia.

1028
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:16,160
When these O. J. tweets started
popping up on my timeline,

1029
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,440
I didn't know what to think.

1030
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,020
And then he said that the Khloe rumors are

1031
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,830
bad, bogus and tasteless.

1032
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:26,190
But you can't take something
seriously from a guy

1033
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:28,672
who wrote a book called "If I Did It".

1034
00:37:28,672 --> 00:37:30,120
- [Harvey] Yeah, (laughs) right.

1035
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:35,120
- Honestly to me, Khloe
pre-op looks just like O. J.

1036
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:39,000
And if you put a picture of Sydney Simpson

1037
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,633
up against Khloe Kardashian pre-op,

1038
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:44,560
it's undeniable.

1039
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,766
It's like they're twins.

1040
00:37:45,766 --> 00:37:47,984
- So, Melissa, sorry, Erica.
- It's deniable.

1041
00:37:47,984 --> 00:37:49,003
- So Erica, you just came on here

1042
00:37:49,003 --> 00:37:51,240
and you're just gonna
completely start this up again?

1043
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,160
Like everybody involved has shot it down.

1044
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,790
- People look like other
people, and also Sydney Simpson,

1045
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:59,000
I mean, that would be a different mother,

1046
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,717
so none of them, it
just doesn't make sense.

1047
00:38:00,717 --> 00:38:02,573
- And how many times are
you gonna say pre-op?

1048
00:38:02,573 --> 00:38:04,509
That's like the game, man.
(Charles laughing)

1049
00:38:04,509 --> 00:38:06,213
That's all I heard, that's shady, dog.

1050
00:38:06,213 --> 00:38:07,840
- A lot of shade, a lot of shade.

1051
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,673
We're gonna move on.

1052
00:38:08,673 --> 00:38:11,480
(upbeat music)

1053
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,630
- Mafia rules do not
apply for George Lopez

1054
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,380
when dealing with President Trump.

1055
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,820
You know Mafia rules, you
leave women and children out.

1056
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:19,653
- [Harvey] That's true.

1057
00:38:19,653 --> 00:38:23,460
- Right, because George is going after

1058
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,930
the first family,

1059
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:27,230
and specifically on the
immigration policies

1060
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:28,660
of the administration,

1061
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:32,850
and says that he has no issues
dragging children into it.

1062
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:36,260
I get that the President
has older adult children,

1063
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,350
but even Barron.

1064
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:39,440
This is the post that George Lopez put up,

1065
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,690
and made the point of
including Barron in there.

1066
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:46,390
Barron who is 13 years
old, and making it clear

1067
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,270
that he's from an immigrant mother.

1068
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:49,505
- [Harvey] Right.

1069
00:38:49,505 --> 00:38:51,600
- [Charles] (laughs) And that actually all

1070
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:55,257
of his children also, his first
wife, also an immigrant so--

1071
00:38:55,257 --> 00:38:56,950
- [Harvey] Not all maples, not Tiffany.

1072
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:59,170
- No, you're right, Tiffany
is not included there.

1073
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,210
So yes, calling them all anchor babies.

1074
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:04,630
So we got George out 'cause
a lot of people feel like,

1075
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:07,100
look, obviously people are very critical

1076
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,460
of the immigration
policy, that's one thing.

1077
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,890
But when you start bringing, you know,

1078
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:12,973
minor children into it.
- Kids, yeah.

1079
00:39:12,973 --> 00:39:14,410
- [Charles] Does it cross the line?

1080
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:15,560
- So we got him out.
- Yeah.

1081
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,114
- [Interviewer] Do you think
it's fair to put Barron

1082
00:39:17,114 --> 00:39:19,400
in that post?

1083
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,910
(laughs)

1084
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:21,910
- Why?

1085
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:23,100
- [Interviewer] He's a kid, you know.

1086
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,540
- Is it fair to put kids in cages?

1087
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,496
They're kids.

1088
00:39:26,496 --> 00:39:30,140
Let's go Ancestry.com and 23andMe,

1089
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:33,580
so everybody's swabbing
the insides of their mouth

1090
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,720
to find out where they came from,

1091
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,650
and you know what we can all agree on?

1092
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:38,050
Is that nobody is from here.

1093
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:39,764
Immigration has always been a problem

1094
00:39:39,764 --> 00:39:41,390
and it will continue to be a problem,

1095
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:44,420
but only targeting Latinos is not good.

1096
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:47,150
- [Harvey] So you know who
would disagree with him?

1097
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:47,983
- Who's that?

1098
00:39:47,983 --> 00:39:49,670
- The Obamas.

1099
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:51,750
They made it very clear.

1100
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,810
- Children--
- During the presidency

1101
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:55,460
that unless, you know,

1102
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:58,670
Sasha and Malia were part of an event

1103
00:39:58,670 --> 00:39:59,640
where, you know,
- Right.

1104
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,830
- they were there.
- They did not want them to be

1105
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:05,360
- They really were against
them even being photographed,

1106
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,920
because they said they
didn't sign up for this.

1107
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,300
I think they would disagree with that.

1108
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,710
- I think a lot of presidential families

1109
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:10,543
actually would disagree with it.

1110
00:40:10,543 --> 00:40:11,899
I think the Clintons
would disagree with it

1111
00:40:11,899 --> 00:40:13,890
because they also fought
for privacy for Chelsea

1112
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:16,200
because she was in the limelight as well

1113
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,040
during their presidency and
faced a lot of, you know,

1114
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,110
undue attention and a lot
of criticism, meanness,

1115
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:24,110
and this was before the
era of social media.

1116
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:26,060
But of course I think what
George is referring to,

1117
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:29,140
you know here by targeting
Donald Trump's children,

1118
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,790
is again sort of all of the
actions that have been taken

1119
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:34,180
by the administration against
children at the border.

1120
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,390
Putting them in cages.

1121
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:37,970
So, I mean, I think the point
that he's trying to make,

1122
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:41,670
you know, might be a valid one,

1123
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:45,990
but it's using people that
is unfair, in unfair way.

1124
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:47,140
- Here's the thing.

1125
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:50,960
He could make the point
just with Donald Jr.

1126
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,103
and Eric and Ivanka.

1127
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,000
He doesn't have to go to Barron.

1128
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,920
- [Charles] You don't
have to go to Barron.

1129
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:58,933
- And that's why it's
a little problematic.

1130
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:02,800
- Hey guys, how you
doin', my name's Dominic.

1131
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,683
This issue is a little pressing.

1132
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:09,334
I would say instead of
targeting Barron Trump,

1133
00:41:09,334 --> 00:41:10,963
he includes him.

1134
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:15,260
In a way yes, he's wrong for
you to include the family,

1135
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:18,760
but to compare the Obamas and the Clintons

1136
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,550
to the Trumps is literally
comparing apples to oranges.

1137
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:23,707
- I don't think it is,
I gotta stop you there.

1138
00:41:23,707 --> 00:41:25,307
- Could you erase politics--
- Yeah.

1139
00:41:25,307 --> 00:41:27,300
- And just say it's about--
- It's about a family

1140
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,910
with minor kids.
- Right.

1141
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:31,890
- And the issue is do
you, because once you,

1142
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:32,800
look, here's the thing.

1143
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,100
This country is divided
almost down the middle,

1144
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:38,140
so whatever you allow on this side,

1145
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,530
this side's gonna do.

1146
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,690
So, at a point you have to have a policy.

1147
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:44,500
If the policy is minor
kids are not fair game,

1148
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,820
then they're not fair game on either side.

1149
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,410
But if they're fair game on one side,

1150
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:49,170
they're gonna be fair
game on the other side.

1151
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:50,250
- Right.
- I mean, it's just

1152
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:51,790
the way it works.

1153
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:53,390
- 'Cause you gotta look at
it without the politics.

1154
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:54,743

and I'm gonna say this
because you like people

00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:36,740
- It might not be done in my lifetime,

1258
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:38,950
but somewhere down the line.

1259
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:40,320
- How long did it take to do?

1260
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,380
- What, Toy Story 4?

1261
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:45,240
I think it took 'em about
three to four years somewhere.

1262
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,000
- Gosh that it a big investment.

1263
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,670
You know, I love the cast,

1264
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:51,090
I mean in addition to
you, you got Tom Hanks,

1265
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:52,290
you've got Tim Allen.

1266
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:54,743
I love that Tony Hale is in the show.

1267
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:58,350
He's so funny, he was
so amazing on "Veep".

1268
00:45:58,350 --> 00:46:00,718
- Yeah, the way they see him on this,

1269
00:46:00,718 --> 00:46:03,092
I think he's the funniest
character in the movie.

1270
00:46:03,092 --> 00:46:06,190
(mumbles) The character
he plays is hysterical.

1271
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:07,810
- John, I gotta ask you something,

1272
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:09,570
I saw Toy Story 3,

1273
00:46:09,570 --> 00:46:13,270
and of course it was a phenomenal
movie, made huge money,

1274
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,730
broke all kinds of records.

1275
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:17,571
But at the end, it was sad,

1276
00:46:17,571 --> 00:46:20,530
it was a very, very sad tough watch.

1277
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:22,540
There were people in the theater
crying and stuff like that.

1278
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:25,210
There are people out there,
parents who are concerned

1279
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:27,480
about bringing their kids to the movie

1280
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,833
if it's gonna be that sad.

1281
00:46:28,833 --> 00:46:31,180
Does this one have kind of the same tenor

1282
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:32,880
as Toy Story 3, or is it
a little bit different?

1283
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,540
- Well, so the kids don't have to wait

1284
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:37,075
'till their grandfather dies, you know.

1285
00:46:37,075 --> 00:46:41,408
(Harvey and Van laugh hysterically)

1286
00:46:42,416 --> 00:46:44,100
It'll give 'em a chance to work through

1287
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:45,894
the sadness at an early age.

1288
00:46:45,894 --> 00:46:49,140
(Harvey and Van laughing)

1289
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:52,430
It's not that sad, it's
sad but it's not that sad.

1290
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:55,120
- So, that's hilarious.

1291
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:58,793
Don Rickles, you know, he
played Mr. Potato Head.

1292
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:02,770
He passed in 2017.

1293
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:04,620
You guys brought him back.

1294
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:07,270
- Well yeah, yeah Josh did, the director.

1295
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:10,620
He searched for hours
and hours over old tape

1296
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:14,010
that they had for Don
in the other Toy Stories

1297
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:16,260
and of some promos he did.

1298
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:20,757
So he cobbled together
Don's part from those tapes.

1299
00:47:20,757 --> 00:47:22,310
- [Van] That is actually amazing.

1300
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:23,860
- It's amazing.

1301
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:25,730
John, I just gotta ask
you 'cause what Van said

1302
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:26,750
at the beginning is so right.

1303
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:30,060
I mean, you've just had
the most incredible career.

1304
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:33,410
I'm just curious about when
you finished with "Cheers",

1305
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:34,243
'cause there's so many people

1306
00:47:34,243 --> 00:47:36,175
who think it'll never
get bigger than this--

1307
00:47:36,175 --> 00:47:37,780
- [Van] How could you go out of "Cheers"?

1308
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:38,613
- Yeah.

1309
00:47:38,613 --> 00:47:43,150
And it's like just personally,
did you think that?

1310
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:44,930
Was it shocking to you?

1311
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:46,700
Did you kind of expect it all along?

1312
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:49,170
I'm just dying to know
what was in your head,

1313
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:50,948
you know, at the end of that run.

1314
00:47:50,948 --> 00:47:54,620
- Well, every day was a gift from God,

1315
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:56,470
I mean you had to pinch yourself

1316
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:58,710
'cause your job description was,

1317
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:02,450
you sit at a bar, crack
jokes, and get paid for it.

1318
00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:05,980
I mean that's, talk about
the luckiest people on earth,

1319
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:08,870
and then I get a call from John Lasseter

1320
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:11,506
25 years ago saying,
"Do you wanna play a pig

1321
00:48:11,506 --> 00:48:14,047
"in a cartoon movie?"

1322
00:48:16,363 --> 00:48:18,880
That's it, 25 years now I've
been working with Pixar.

1323
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,420
- So, Pixar is the most
successful film studio

1324
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:24,550
of all time, you are in every Pixar movie.

1325
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:28,757
John, are you the most
successful actor of all time?

1326
00:48:28,757 --> 00:48:30,413
(John laughs)

1327
00:48:30,413 --> 00:48:32,443
- Why would you laugh at that?
- Why you laughin'?

1328
00:48:32,443 --> 00:48:33,451
- [Harvey] I wouldn't laugh at that, John.

1329
00:48:33,451 --> 00:48:36,165
- [Van] I think you've
got a solid case my G!

1330
00:48:36,165 --> 00:48:39,370
- I'm just thinking of
images of Spencer Tracy

1331
00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:42,363
and John Malkovich popped up in my head.

1332
00:48:42,363 --> 00:48:43,869
(laughing)

1333
00:48:43,869 --> 00:48:45,058
- [Harvey] I mean.

1334
00:48:45,058 --> 00:48:48,130
- Box office-wise I think
I'm number three though.

1335
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:49,710
- Really?
- Yeah.

1336
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:50,866
- [Van] Who's one and two?

1337
00:48:50,866 --> 00:48:52,260
- I don't know.

1338
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:55,380
- Oh I know, Samuel L.
Jackson I think is one.

1339
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:57,810
- Sam's got to be up
there, certainly, yeah.

1340
00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:00,070
- Wow, we got a top five star.

1341
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:02,810
- I know, I'm so excited.
- Of all time

on our show, man.

1343
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:05,330
- I'm so excited.

1344
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:08,610
Hey John, listen, we're thrilled for you.

1345
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:10,660
It really is an honor to have you on,

00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:13,150

00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:20,082
- Thank you, thank you very much.

1350
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,190
I appreciate that.

1351

1352
00:49:22,023 --> 00:49:23,410
Thank you John.
- Cheers brother.

1353
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:24,443

how Giant's fresh Chesapeake Bay seafood

is 100% sustainable.

are sourced from over
40 family-owned farms.

Or how we carry local dry
aged steaks and burgers.

1369
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:00,960
They're not talking
because they're eating.

1370
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,303
Mm, looks delicious.

1371
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:06,230
At Giant, we believe in local

00:51:42,983 --> 00:51:45,650
(playful music)

1413
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:51,370
- [Narrator] These kids just discovered

1414
00:51:51,370 --> 00:51:55,000
an all-natural version
of a video game classic.

1415
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,844
Luray Caverns, what will you discover?

1416
00:51:57,844 --> 00:52:00,427
(upbeat music)

1417
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:03,700
- Welcome back to TMZ Live,

1418
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:07,292
if you showed up for
something called Skankfest.

1419
00:52:07,292 --> 00:52:08,197
(laughs)

1420
00:52:08,197 --> 00:52:09,630
- That is the name.
- It's a comedy festival,

1421
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:10,940
Skankfest Comedy Mayhem.

1422
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:14,600
It's a festival in Brooklyn,
you got a big surprise

1423
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,570
because there was a
performer that no one knew

1424
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:17,403
was gonna be there,

1425
00:52:17,403 --> 00:52:20,200
in fact we're told really the organizer.

1426
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,033
- Yeah, that was it.

1427
00:52:21,033 --> 00:52:23,330
- It was the only person
who pulled this off,

1428
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:28,310
and then announced that,
"Surprise, Louis C.K. is here".

1429
00:52:28,310 --> 00:52:30,840
- So what kind of reaction
do you think he got?

1430
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:33,910
I would have anticipated
a really strong reaction

1431
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:36,318
because in the comedy circuit,
he's always gotten that.

1432
00:52:36,318 --> 00:52:38,510
- This is a festival that was just about

1433
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:41,000
comedians for three days, so--

1434
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:41,833
- And you know that he--

1435
00:52:41,833 --> 00:52:43,475
- If you're there, you're a diehard

1436
00:52:43,475 --> 00:52:44,308
comedy fan.
- There were issues that

1437
00:52:44,308 --> 00:52:45,833
came up with him.

1438
00:52:47,048 --> 00:52:49,950
- When he made a surprise
appearance a few months ago.

1439
00:52:49,950 --> 00:52:51,420
- No, no I'm just saying
that the backstory

1440
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:52,253
of this whole thing.

1441
00:52:52,253 --> 00:52:53,086
- That's the back story of course.

1442
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:53,950
- Which you probably heard.

1443
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:56,530
- Louis, you know, masturbating
in front of people,

1444
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:59,100
and you know he lost--

1445
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:00,140
- He lost a lot of gigs.

1446
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:02,053
- A lot of gigs, he lost a movie.

1447
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:05,010
So, he's been trying he's been doing

1448
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:09,530
these appearances every now
and then to mixed reactions.

1449
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:10,395
So here's what happened.

1450
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:12,290
- [Announcer] Skankfest
is a cool event, right?

1451
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:14,902
You never know what can happen.

1452
00:53:14,902 --> 00:53:16,299
Crazy things can happen.

1453
00:53:16,299 --> 00:53:17,132
Here's one of those crazy things.

1454
00:53:17,132 --> 00:53:19,914
Ladies and gentlemen, Louis C.K.!

1455
00:53:19,914 --> 00:53:22,664
(crowd cheering)

1456
00:53:30,031 --> 00:53:33,114
- [Crowd] Louis, Louis, Louis, Louis!

1457
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,970
- [Harvey] This went on for a long time.

1458
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:37,220
- [Charles] Long ovation,

1459
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:41,780
and so you can't even say
that's mixed, I mean, that is--

1460
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:43,210
- [Harvey] It was not mixed.

1461
00:53:43,210 --> 00:53:45,580
- That is as, it's as full throated

1462
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:46,870
an ovation he's gonna get.

1463
00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:48,390
- Yeah, it's a pretty shocking response.

1464
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:49,970
I mean it almost sounds like, you know,

1465
00:53:49,970 --> 00:53:52,389
the audience's favorite
team just won a game

1466
00:53:52,389 --> 00:53:53,222
(laughs) or something like that.

1467
00:53:53,222 --> 00:53:54,690
- [Charles] Well I would
say for a lot of people

1468
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:58,640
in that crowd, Louis before
anything happened, remember,

1469
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,770
was on top of the comedy world.

1470
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:02,900
- Right.
- So this was,

1471
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,380
you know, for diehard comedy fans,

1472
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:06,410
they would've probably
been jonesing to see

1473
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:08,090
Louis C.K. perform again.

1474
00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:09,830
That's, I think, why
you got that reaction,

1475
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:12,940
and I don't know if going
forward this will help him,

1476
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:14,680
but we're told the people who were there

1477
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:17,150
that he actually did open with a joke,

1478
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:18,260
or I don't know if it's a joke,

1479
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:19,500
but he referred to his--

1480
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:21,240
- Yeah, he opened the set by saying

1481
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,280
if you ever masturbate
in front of someone,

1482
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,160
ask them first, and if they say yes,

1483
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,660
- Don't do it.
- don't do it.

1484
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:27,493
- By the way, I don't
know if you saw this,

1485
00:54:27,493 --> 00:54:29,750
but Roseanne is performing
in Atlantic City.

1486
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:32,110
- Yep, with--
- And the same name.

1487
00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:34,630
Yeah, that this is again what we talked

1488
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:35,910
about with snapshots and whatnot.

1489
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:36,920
- That you cannot--
- So we'll see.

1490
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:39,310
I mean, who was that again?

1491
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:40,626
- Andrew Dice Clay, yeah.
- Andrew Dice Clay,

1492
00:54:40,626 --> 00:54:41,459
that's right.

1493
00:54:41,459 --> 00:54:42,910
- That's an interesting double builder.

1494
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:47,280
- Hi, this is Sarah Butler
from Des Moines, Iowa.

1495
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,113
- Hi Sarah. (laughs)

1496
00:54:48,113 --> 00:54:51,280
- Hey, I think he's doing
what he does best, comedy.

1497
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,200
I mean he may have made a mistake,

1498
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,010
and done some things
some people don't like

1499
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:58,490
but gettin' right back into,
you know, the business,

1500
00:54:58,490 --> 00:55:01,463
what he loves to do and what he's good at,

1501
00:55:01,463 --> 00:55:02,700
and he's good at making people laugh.

1502
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:06,940
So, I mean I think he
should've gone right back.

1503
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:09,260
- [Harvey] Yeah, and the
audience received him well.

1504
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:10,742
- It was when they were gonna forgive,

1505
00:55:10,742 --> 00:55:12,215
and it sounds like it's there.

1506
00:55:12,215 --> 00:55:13,048

1568
00:57:58,907 --> 00:57:59,740
- That seems weird, right?

1569
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:02,730
Especially because A-Rod was
sitting right between them.

1570
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:04,800
Actually he was passionately singing,

1571
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:08,530
but this was an event for
Marc and Jennifer's kids,

1572
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:10,160
and Alex is there of course now.

1573
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:13,440

that shows everybody's

getting along just fine.

this was one of their,

1579
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:30,440
I don't know which one of their kids

1580
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,950
was having a choir concert.

1581
00:58:31,950 --> 00:58:32,930
- You know, you really have to commend

into that relationship,

1586
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:40,220
it honestly could mess everything up.

1587
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:41,960
But you know what, A-Rod is a great dude.

1588
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:42,964
It looks like he's having a great time.

1589
00:58:42,964 --> 00:58:44,660
It looks like him and
Marc Anthony are bros.

1590
