- [Announcer] What is love?

4
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,810
Two hearts, one soul?

5
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:07,643
A kiss?

6
00:00:07,643 --> 00:00:08,476
A hug?

7
00:00:08,476 --> 00:00:09,309
A laugh?

8
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:10,300
It's passion.

9
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,220
It's freedom.

10
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,260
It's mystery.

11
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,700
It's the journey and the destination.

12
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,370
It's vows made and promises kept.

13
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,090
It's a feeling, a need, no rules.

14
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,120
All included, all unlimited.

15
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,090
Feed your hunger.

16
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,210
Quench your thirst.

17
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,530
Live your dreams.

18
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,770
Fulfilled, indulged, reborn.

19
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:29,670
What is love?

20
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,060
Love is all you need.

- [Announcer] Calm today.

23
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,240
- All right, that wraps us
this hour of MSNBC Live.

24
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,033
My friend Ali Velshi is here
to pick up our coverage.

25
00:00:42,033 --> 00:00:44,250
- Nice to see you again 24 hours later.

26
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,860
It was fun working with you yesterday

27
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,530
when we were covering a difficult story.

28
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,420
But thank you for you
coverage this afternoon.

29
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,253
Are you done?
- Happy to be here.

30
00:00:50,253 --> 00:00:51,086
I am done.

31
00:00:51,086 --> 00:00:52,470
- [Ali] All right, have yourself
a great rest of the day.

32
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,710
- You too.
- See you.

33
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:54,543
All right, good afternoon.

34
00:00:54,543 --> 00:00:55,376
I'm Ali Velshi.

35
00:00:55,376 --> 00:00:57,150
It's Friday, July 5th,
two o'clock in the East

36
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,730
where a deadline has just
passed for the White House

37
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,710
to announce whether it will keep fighting

38
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,360
to add a citizenship
question to the 2020 census.

39
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,500
A federal judge in overseeing
one of three separate lawsuits

40
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,990
over the question ruled that
the Trump administration

41
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:16,310
must explain how it's going
to proceed by two p.m. today.

42
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,940
President Trump addressed the controversy

43
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,193
with reporters earlier.

44
00:01:21,087 --> 00:01:21,920
- [Reporter] Are you going to issue

45
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,360
an executive order on the census?

46
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,273
- We're thinking about doing that.

47
00:01:24,273 --> 00:01:25,310
It's one of the ways.

48
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,480
We have four or five ways we can do it.

49
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,370
It's one of the ways

50
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:30,140
that we're thinking about
doing it very seriously.

51
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,512
We're doing well on the census.

52
00:01:31,512 --> 00:01:33,510
(reporter mumbles)

53
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,901
No, he made a statement.

54
00:01:34,901 --> 00:01:36,310
He wrote something up.

55
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,430
The judge didn't like it.

56
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,110
I have a lot of respect
for Justice Roberts,

57
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:41,630
but he didn't like it.

58
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,660
But he did say come back.

59
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,660
Essentially, he said come back.

60
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,600
That's what he was saying.

61
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,820
So we'll see what happens.

62
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,140
- [Ali] The case seemed all but
settled just a few days ago.

63
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,840
The Supreme Court ruled last week

64
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,750
that the Commerce Department's
current justification

65
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,440
for putting the question on the census

66
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,540
was not legally sound,
calling it contrived

67
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,410
and the government has
even begun printing copies

68
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,620
of the census without
the question included.

69
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,140
But earlier this week, the President,

70
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,170
reportedly spurred on
by Conservative allies,

71
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,810
announced on Twitter that his
administration will once again

72
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,260
take up the fight, sending
White House lawyers scrambling

73
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,530
over the holiday to come
up with a new argument.

74
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:19,363
Joining me now,

75
00:02:19,363 --> 00:02:21,290
NBC News justice
correspondent Pete Williams.

76
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:24,550
Pete you had a lot of specific guidance

77
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,040
that you've been giving
us through the day about--

78
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,873
- Pardon me for,

79
00:02:26,873 --> 00:02:27,706
I'm just gonna look away.

80
00:02:27,706 --> 00:02:29,390
This is going to panic everyone

81
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,690
that's speaking to me in my ear.

82
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,540
I'm listening, but I'm
looking at something

83
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,060
that's just been filed, so go ahead.

84
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,077
- That's what we were waiting for.

85
00:02:35,077 --> 00:02:37,610
There was a two p.m. deadline for a filing

86
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,277
in which the government either had to say,

87
00:02:39,277 --> 00:02:41,160
"We're gonna continue on with this fight,"

88
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,780
or it could say, "We're not continuing."

89
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,210
The two p.m. deadline,
the most important thing

90
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,590
that would happen is if we
heard the government say

91
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,480
we're giving it up.
- Can you bring that to me?

92
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,170
- So that's essentially
what we're waiting for.

93
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,540
If the government doesn't
choose to withdraw

94
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,890
its fight to add a citizenship question,

95
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:59,590
then things continue as they are.

96
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,900
The census will be printed.

97
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,880
The government will have
to figure out a new way

98
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,140
to get it on there, and
that may not happen.

99
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,360
- So this is what's, just a second ago,

100
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,600
been filed by the government.

101
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,807
And no surprise here, they say,
"We're gonna keep fighting."

102
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:16,570
They filed what they call
their proposed discovery plan

103
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:21,080
and what they say is they
lay out a schedule for

104
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:26,360
how to continue in this Maryland lawsuit,

105
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,240
the separate lawsuit from
the Supreme Court case

106
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,072
on the census form.

107
00:03:31,072 --> 00:03:32,810
So no surprise here,

108
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:35,433
the government says it
wants to continue fighting.

109
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,800
- So while you read that,
here's what I wanna lay out.

110
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,890
The government says it's
gonna continue fighting.

111
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,990
For the moment, the
government continues to print

112
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,630
the census forms, because that
was the argument they used,

113
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,560
that they needed a judgment or at least

114
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,160
some kind of guidance
from the Supreme Court

115
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,490
before June 30th in order
to print these forms.

116
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,730
So those forms continue to be printed.

117
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,750
The government's not giving up its fight.

118
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,860
Logistically, Pete,
(Pete chuckles)

119
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,830
what happens next?
- Okay.

120
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:01,960
- What can happen?

121
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,610
- All right, so here are the options

122
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,680
based on what I've just been able to read

123
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,910
from what the government has filed

124
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,960
and what the other side
in this case has filed.

125
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,053
So first, we have the Supreme Court case.

126
00:04:12,053 --> 00:04:15,300
That was started from a
lawsuit filed by 18 states,

127
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,250
led by New York, went
to the US Supreme Court.

128
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,810
Last week, the Supreme
Court said this explanation

129
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:22,810
that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross gave

130
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,160
for why he wanted the
question in the form,

131
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,430
clearly, it doesn't wash.

132
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,620
It's a pretext.

133
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,190
You can't print the
census if that's the basis

134
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,780
for wanting it on the form.

135
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,590
So the Supreme Court has
ordered the government

136
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,350
not to print the census
with that question on it.

137
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,203
And in fact, it's now printing
it without that question.

138
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,380
So what are the alternatives?

139
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,250
One is Wilbur Ross could come up

140
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,010
with a new justification for it

141
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:51,150
that would start a whole
new round of litigation.

142
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,510
The government clearly thinks

143
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,360
that's not a very productive way

144
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,650
because they thought earlier
this week, it was all over,

145
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:00,490
and then the President said,
"You gotta keep trying."

146
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,600
Another possibility that the
President himself raised today

147
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,870
is the President simply
signs an executive order

148
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,700
directing the Commerce Department
to tell the Census Bureau

149
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,850
to put this question on the form.

150
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:14,833
That, again, would start a
whole new round of litigation.

151
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:16,860
Anything the government does

152
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,693
from hereon is--
- Let's just stop

153
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:19,520
at that one for a second,
an executive order.

154
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,077
The President, this president
certainly believes it,

155
00:05:21,077 --> 00:05:24,430
and by the way, he's not the
first president to think so,

156
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,360
that certain things can be
done by executive order.

157
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,690
But is the President clear
that an executive order

158
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,520
to put the question on
the census doesn't mean

159
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,140
that the census gets printed

160
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,200
with the citizenship question on it?

161
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,619
- Correct.

162
00:05:35,619 --> 00:05:38,110
It's not gonna do it by
itself because that will

163
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,010
immediately produce
another court challenge.

164
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,030
Anything the government does from hereon

165
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,360
is gonna produce a court challenge.

166
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,040
That's a certainty.

167
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,000
So back to your question,
using the word logistics,

168
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,500
how long would that take?

169
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,090
How long does the government
have before it really can't?

170
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:57,970
It has to just keep printing
the forms without the question.

171
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:00,180
I don't think anybody
has a good clear answer

172
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,400
to when the final drop dead date is

173
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,950
for not tinkering around
with this thing any further.

174
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,410
It's gonna cost a lot of
money if they throw away

175
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,170
all the forms they've already
printed and start over again.

176
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,180
Another option though would be

177
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,760
to either include this
citizenship question

178
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,520
on the longer form, the
household survey that goes

179
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,770
to just a small percentage
of US households,

180
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:26,160
or an additional form,
an additional question

181
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,320
that goes with the short form
that goes to all households,

182
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,767
just a simple piece of paper that says,

183
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,520
"Are you a US citizen, yes or no,"

184
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,990
what they wanted to put on
the form in the first place.

185
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:39,640
Now that too, I think,
will lead to litigation

186
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,640
because the groups opposed to this say

187
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,070
it would have the same
kind of chilling effect.

188
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,830
But, you know, as we think
through all this, remember,

189
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,680
no matter what you may think
of this as a policy matter,

190
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,700
whether it's a wise thing
to put this on the form,

191
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,280
whether it will lead to an under count,

192
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,350
or whether it will give
us more information,

193
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:59,260
that's a balancing test,
just recall that throughout

194
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,630
most censuses in American history,

195
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,430
there has been a citizenship question.

196
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:07,590
So the government has
some weight on its side

197
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,050
if it can come up with a rationale

198
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,530
that satisfies these challenges.

199
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,140
Now one other point.

200
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,007
The President said
today, when he was asked,

201
00:07:14,007 --> 00:07:15,970
"Why do you want this
question on the form,"

202
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,937
said, "Well, you need it to figure out

203
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:21,030
"how many seats a state
gets in the House."

204
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,240
That is demonstrably not true.

205
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,230
No apportionment throughout our history,

206
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,960
and we've just celebrated
another birthday,

207
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,450
has ever been based on
just counting citizens.

208
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:34,050
It's always been total inhabitants.

209
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,500
And that was clear from the
constitutional convention

210
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,730
and clear from when Congress
enacted the 14th Amendment

211
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:42,170
which gave further guidance
on how to conduce a census.

212
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,180
So in that sense, you
don't need citizenship data

213
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,710
to apportion a membership in the house.

214
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,480
- Pete, I'm gonna give you the option.

215
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,350
You can hang out with me while
I bring Barbara McQuade in.

216
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,880
I do know that you have
some reading to do.

217
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,310
So you're welcome to sit
in front of that camera

218
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,143
and do the reading.

219
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,780
And if you hear something
you want, chime in.

220
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,613
- Okay.
- Let's bring

221
00:07:58,613 --> 00:08:01,270
former US Attorney from the
Eastern District of Michigan,

222
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,920
Barbara McQuade in.

223
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,690
Barbara, there's a lot
to get through here.

224
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:07,100
This seemed like a simple
question at one time.

225
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,770
Can you put the citizenship
question on the census or not?

226
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:12,710
Now it's gotten complicated
because the Supreme Court said

227
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:15,340
that the Commerce Department's reasoning

228
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,000
was not appropriate for doing so.

229
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,950
But they didn't say that
means, to Pete's earlier point,

230
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,740
that a citizenship question
can't be on the census.

231
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,197
Basically, the Supreme Court
said to the government,

232
00:08:25,197 --> 00:08:28,377
"You can come back with a
better reason and try again."

233
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,890
- Well, they can, but it
has to be a genuine reason.

234
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:35,150
And what the court found was
that the reason that they gave,

235
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:38,250
that the purpose was so that
they could better comply

236
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,960
with the Voting Rights Act,
was a lie, was a pretext.

237
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,170
The word they used was contrivance.

238
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:44,557
And they said, "If you wanna try again

239
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:47,140
"and tell us the real
reason, we'll consider that."

240
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,370
But it's hard to imagine
that they could come back

241
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,857
and say, "Oh, when we told you

242
00:08:50,857 --> 00:08:53,337
"it was about the Voting Rights
Act, we just made a mistake.

243
00:08:53,337 --> 00:08:56,170
"The real reason was the following."

244
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:59,220
It's hard to imagine that any
new reason they came up with,

245
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,580
you know, my dog ate it,

246
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,410
is something that could be believed.

247
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:05,470
And so it's hard to
imagine, going forward,

248
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:08,730
that there's going to be
a path to victory here

249
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:09,660
for President Trump.

250
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,780
- Now, there's another issue,

251
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,560
and that is that the government's lawyers

252
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,217
went to the Supreme Court and
said, "We kinda need this done

253
00:09:16,217 --> 00:09:20,627
"in a hurry because we gotta
print these forms by June 30th

254
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:23,540
"in order to get them printed
and distributed on time."

255
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,387
Now, when you go back to the
Supreme Court and you say,

256
00:09:26,387 --> 00:09:27,337
"Yeah, you know that deadline

257
00:09:27,337 --> 00:09:29,797
"we told you we really needed it done by.

258
00:09:29,797 --> 00:09:31,067
"Because we have different reasons,

259
00:09:31,067 --> 00:09:32,220
"we can push that deadline."

260
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,540
Does that affect the credibility
of the government's lawyers

261
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,500
in front of the Supreme Court?

262
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,330
Or is that not important?

263
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:39,730
- No, it absolutely does.

264
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,760
And every lawyer who works
for the Department of Justice

265
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,467
knows that not only like
every lawyer do they have

266
00:09:44,467 --> 00:09:47,100
a duty of candor to the tribunal,

267
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,350
but the Justice Department
has an even higher duty,

268
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,920
as lawyers on behalf of the United States,

269
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,820
to tell the truth.

270
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,960
And in fact, here, it wasn't
just a passing statement

271
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,850
that they made that could be characterized

272
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,030
as a slip of the tongue.

273
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,767
They actually affirmatively
said, "We don't have time

274
00:10:02,767 --> 00:10:05,077
"to go through the normal
route of the Second Circuit

275
00:10:05,077 --> 00:10:08,117
"Court of Appeals because
time is of the essence

276
00:10:08,117 --> 00:10:11,137
"and this is of such public
importance that we need to skip

277
00:10:11,137 --> 00:10:14,067
"that ordinary step and go
directly to the Supreme Court

278
00:10:14,067 --> 00:10:17,017
"because June 30th is
our absolute deadline

279
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:18,570
"for getting these things printed."

280
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:21,180
To now go back and say, "We made that up,"

281
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,640
I think would harm the Justice Department

282
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,590
not only in this case,
but the Justice Department

283
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:28,330
every other case it litigates
everyday around the country.

284
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,510
- [Ali] Pete?

285
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,540
- Well, just this is a very short thing

286
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,870
that the government filed here,

287
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,870
and I don't think it really changes

288
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,830
a lot of what we've said, but
just to amplify one thing.

289
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,307
They say, "Right, Judge.

290
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:44,137
"We're currently enjoined in
printing a census questionnaire

291
00:10:44,137 --> 00:10:45,857
"that includes the citizenship question.

292
00:10:45,857 --> 00:10:46,923
"We're not doing it.

293
00:10:48,457 --> 00:10:52,474
"But any new decision by
the Commerce Department

294
00:10:52,474 --> 00:10:56,817
"on providing another rationale
for why it wants to do this

295
00:10:56,817 --> 00:11:00,467
"would constitute a new
final agency action,

296
00:11:00,467 --> 00:11:02,407
"and plaintiffs will be fully entitled

297
00:11:02,407 --> 00:11:04,010
"to challenge the decision at that time."

298
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:06,900
So that goes back to what
we were saying earlier, Ali,

299
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,157
that if the Commerce Secretary says,

300
00:11:09,157 --> 00:11:11,090
"Oh, now, here's why I wanna do it,"

301
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:13,390
that will lead to another
round of litigation.

302
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,570
So all they say is in the event

303
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:20,650
the Commerce Department
adopts a new rationale,

304
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,080
the government will
immediately notify this court,

305
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,520
that's the judge in
Maryland, so it can determine

306
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,090
whether there's any need for
further proceedings or relief.

307
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,420
So that's the separate
Maryland case that did not go

308
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,820
to the Supreme Court
that's still simmering.

309
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,653
- All right.

310
00:11:33,653 --> 00:11:35,320
Thank you for your
great reporting on this,

311
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,770
Pete Williams and Barbara McQuade.

312
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,290
Thank you for your excellent
analysis, as always.

313
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,730
Barbara McQuade is a former US Attorney

314
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,470
for the Eastern District of Michigan.

315
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,270
Pete Williams, our justice
reporter who'll continue

316
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,610
to report on this as he
gets through the documents.

317
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:49,130
All right, if it's the
first Friday of the month,

318
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,210
it must be jobs day,
and June's job numbers

319
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,287
appear to be a correction
from May's dismal showing.

320
00:11:54,287 --> 00:11:59,287
224,000 net new jobs
were added last month.

321
00:11:59,774 --> 00:12:01,000
That's a good number.

322
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,450
Don't let anybody tell you otherwise.

323
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:06,540
Unemployment ticked up
slightly from 3.6 to 3.7%.

324
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:10,380
Hourly earnings are up
3.1%, year over year.

325
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,430
Now, that looks pretty good.

326
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,530
Remember that you always

327
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,370
have to subtract inflation from that.

328
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,410
All eyes are now on the Federal Reserve

329
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,590
where Chairman Jerome Powell
is going to have to decide

330
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,730
whether or not these numbers

331
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,800
warrant slashing interest rates.

332
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,100
Joining me now, CNBC's John Harwood.

333
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,420
I mean, this is a tough one
for the President to spin

334
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:29,040
because on one hand, he really,
he likes the job numbers

335
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,730
almost as much as he likes
the stock market numbers.

336
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,110
But touting strong job
numbers means that the Fed

337
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:38,250
now has to reconsider whether
or not to cut interest rates,

338
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,360
which the President really
wants the Fed to do.

339
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,193
- That's right, Ali.

340
00:12:42,193 --> 00:12:43,470
It won't constraint the President.

341
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:46,260
He's gonna continue to
want that interest rate cut

342
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:50,640
because growth in the
economy is slowing from 2018,

343
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,210
and he wants it to rev up again

344
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:54,420
going into the 2020 election year.

345
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:58,210
But the Fed, which weighs
data, has got to figure out

346
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:02,660
whether or not this indicates
that it would be too early

347
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:06,580
to make a rate cut in light
of these jobs numbers.

348
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:10,770
We did have a downward
revision on April and June,

349
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:12,160
or excuse me, April and May,

350
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,510
so that is a negative in that picture.

351
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,820
But nevertheless, these are good numbers.

352
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:22,420
And Jay Powell, in his
last press conference,

353
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,930
said that they removed the word
patience from their guidance

354
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,650
and they indicated that they
were going to be inclined,

355
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:33,070
if the data suggested, to
cut rates one or more times

356
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:33,903
in the rest of the year,

357
00:13:33,903 --> 00:13:36,250
but this makes that
decision more difficult.

358
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,700
- You know, the one thing
that the President wants

359
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,460
is he wants to goose those growth numbers.

360
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,480
They are a little slower.

361
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,150
We do not appear to be
in recession territory

362
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,830
or even close to it at this point,

363
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:50,260
but they're smaller than they were,

364
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,270
and they're smaller than
the President had promised

365
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,700
when he ran in his election.

366
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,877
If you recall, he said, "My
economists think it will be 3%.

367
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:59,537
"I think it could be 4, 5 and 6%."

368
00:13:59,537 --> 00:14:04,537
That is the one lever that
the government has, in theory.

369
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,130
If you lower interest rates,

370
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:10,550
it's like hitting the gas
pedal on the economy, right?

371
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:14,010
That's the thing that can
cause growth to increase,

372
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:16,100
because it becomes
cheaper to borrow money.

373
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,250
Money is more available.

374
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,083
People invest.

375
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:18,916
They build plants.

376
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:21,040
They buy houses, things like that.

377
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,873
That's right.

378
00:14:21,873 --> 00:14:24,620
And it's all the more important
for him to hit the gas pedal

379
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:28,200
since his other foot's hitting
the brake with the trade war.

380
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,100
The uncertainty and the
friction with China,

381
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:35,250
the disruption of supply chains,
the higher consumer prices

382
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,187
as a result pose some risk to the economy.

383
00:14:38,187 --> 00:14:41,860
It's not clear whether
or not if you cut rates,

384
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,550
that that would work on the same timeframe

385
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:48,360
that the trade war is
doing to the economy,

386
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,570
but the fact that he's
pulled back a little bit

387
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:53,910
in recent days from conflict with China,

388
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:56,470
that in itself is good
news for the economy.

389
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,930
And this is one way he
can make it go faster

390
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,890
if Jay Powell decides to go along.

391
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:03,890
But of course, Jay Powell is independent,

392
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:06,550
and I think he values his
reputation for independence,

393
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,880
so he'll make his own decision.

394
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,660
- John, you had a chance to
sit down with Beto O'Rourke

395
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,013
and talk about some of
his economic policies.

396
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:15,490
- Let me ask you about your experience

397
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,930
as a small businessman,

398
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:22,253
both the web services
company, the alt weekly.

399
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:26,500
Do you look upon that as a success?

400
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,230
And what do you take from
it as you think about

401
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,640
the economic challenges of the country?

402
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,970
- Yeah.

403
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:36,570
So I do look at it as
a success, to be able,

404
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:41,510
with good friends, far more
talented, smarter than I was,

405
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:44,920
to come together and
create opportunity and jobs

406
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,780
in the third poorest urban
county in the United States,

407
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:52,130
high-value, high-skill,
high-tech jobs in El Paso, Texas.

408
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,620
That felt really good.

409
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,240
It was really hard to
do, but I'll tell you,

410
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,595
I had some advantages that
other Americans don't.

411
00:15:58,595 --> 00:15:59,770
And I'll give you an example.

412
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:03,210
I could not get a loan in 1998

413
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,647
to start a technology company in El Paso.

414
00:16:05,647 --> 00:16:07,830
I just didn't have the assets

415
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,940
that the bank would lend against.

416
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,960
But my dad, who had a home
that was fully paid for,

417
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,980
could take out a loan on his home

418
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,440
and then lend that money
back to me, 20,000 bucks.

419
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,760
That was the seed capital
that allowed us to start

420
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,690
a business, that ultimately
hired dozens of our fellow

421
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:26,633
El Pasoans and served clients
all over this country.

422
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,790
- You know, John, I often think

423
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:31,590
that people who have
small business experience

424
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,830
could be very useful to our country.

425
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:36,170
You don't have to have
macroeconomic experience.

426
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:37,003
What was your takeaway?

427
00:16:37,003 --> 00:16:39,180
Because you talk to people
about business and economics

428
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,350
and their understanding
of it all the time.

429
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,470
- Well, that's a selling point

430
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,940
for Beto O'Rourke in this race.

431
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,290
He started a business.

432
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:47,110
It's still going 20 years later.

433
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,522
It was a profitable business.

434
00:16:48,522 --> 00:16:51,924
The publishing, the alt
weekly that he founded

435
00:16:51,924 --> 00:16:55,413
went out of business, but
the tech services company

436
00:16:55,413 --> 00:16:57,970
that he's no longer an owner of it

437
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,470
is continuing to operate.

438
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:02,580
The point he went on to
make in that discussion

439
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:06,760
was that he is mindful
that very few Americans

440
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,180
have families that can
stake them to $20,000

441
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,610
to start a small business.

442
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:14,830
A lot of his small business proposals

443
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:19,000
are designed to extend more
credit, more tax incentives

444
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,440
to communities of color
where wealth inequality

445
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,770
has suppressed the
formation of small business,

446
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:27,320
and that's a big talking
point for him in the race.

447
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,610
- I skipped lunch, which is a bad idea,

448
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:32,916
and I kept watching you
while you were eating

449
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,025
and trying to figure out what you ate.

450
00:17:34,025 --> 00:17:35,270
What were you eating?

451
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,840
- I was eating the enchilada platter,

452
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,710
half red sauce, half green sauce.

453
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:40,543
It was delicious.

454
00:17:40,543 --> 00:17:44,930
He had tacos, though as
you can see, he was talking

455
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,060
most of the time and not
inclined to pick 'em up.

456
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,560
- [Ali] I enjoy interview like that,

457
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,080
where someone else is
talking and I'm eating.

458
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,926
- [John] Right. (chuckles)

459
00:17:50,926 --> 00:17:51,759
- And good to see you, my friend.

460
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:52,592
Thank you, John Harwood--
- You bet, thank you.

461
00:17:52,592 --> 00:17:53,753
- Editor-at-large at CNBC.

462
00:17:53,753 --> 00:17:56,050
All right, still to come,
the President once again

463
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,150
blames the border crisis on Democrats,

464
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:00,410
saying they're treating
border agents unfairly.

465
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,270
He even accused some lawmakers of lying.

466
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,103
I'll get the reaction

467
00:18:03,103 --> 00:18:05,250
from Texas Democrat
Congressman Marc Veasey

468
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,860
who toured border facilities this week.

469
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,530
But first, Joe Biden
admits he was blindsided

470
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:12,440
by Kamala Harris's confrontation
at the first debate,

471
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,860
and why Biden says despite sliding polls,

472
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,083
he's still the best pick
to take on Donald Trump.

473
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:23,503
- Hi.

474
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:25,310
- [Woman] Look at how great you look.

475
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,390
- Thank you. (chuckles)

476
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:28,950
- I feel like I've been
on a diet my entire life.

477
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:32,120
- I even cut out bread and pasta

478
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:32,953
for a day.

479
00:18:32,953 --> 00:18:33,786
- And then I tried Noom.

480
00:18:33,786 --> 00:18:35,330
- I feel like anyone could use Noom.

481
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:37,010
- It's an easy to stick to program

482
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,670
that actually changed by habits.

483
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,020
It changed the way I looked at food.

484
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,730
- They say it's based on a
cognitive behavioral approach.

485
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:43,720
I just say it works.

486
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,553
- It just clicked.

487
00:18:44,553 --> 00:18:45,420
It worked.

488
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,130
It worked with Noom.

511
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,520

Actually, Zamila, you
touched Shawn Mendes.

- She touched Shawn Mendes.
- Yeah, I touched him.

517
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:04,900
He like held my hand for a while,

518
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,860
and then we got to meet
him after, which was like--

519
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,693
- Another surprise.

520
00:20:07,693 --> 00:20:08,526
- Yeah.

521
00:20:08,526 --> 00:20:09,359
We love Verizon even more now.

522
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:11,490

Nothing.

They're completely different people.

- The wall is the sticking
point, not border security.

- Although the promise was
a wall paid for by Mexico.

I gotta tell you, I

off of other people's information,

560

then your job is to keep
that information safe.

561
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,720
All right, as the Democratic
presidential candidates

562
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,670
race to qualify for the next debate,

563
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,550
we've got new fundraising
numbers to report.

564
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,980
Moments ago, Senator
Kamala Harris's campaign

565
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,870
announced it raised nearly $12 million

566
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:05,720
in the second quarter.

567
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,760
Still in the lend, South
Bend, Indiana mayor,

568
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,630
Pete Buttigieg's campaign announced Monday

569
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,370
it raised $24.8 million.

570
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,240
Front runner Biden trails him

571
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,260
with $21.5 million in the quarter.

572
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,970
Montana governor Steve Bullock,

573
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:23,099
only entered the race in
mid-May and mid-quarter,

574
00:22:23,099 --> 00:22:26,010
has raised a surprising $2 million.

575
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,970
Former Vice President
Joe Biden is addressing

576
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:30,840
those fiery debate
comments from 2020 opponent

577
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,810
Senator Kamala Harris
criticizing his decades-old

578
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:38,130
senate fight against
desegregation of busing

579
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:41,220
and his comments on working
with segregationist senators.

580
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,460
In a new CNN interview,

581
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:45,523
Biden said Harris's
comments were unexpected.

582
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,580
- I mean, it's so easy to go back

583
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:53,040
and go back 30, 40, 50
years and take a context

584
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,240
and take it completely out of context.

585
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,940
And I mean, you know, I
get all this information

586
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:02,890
about other people's past and
what they've done and not done

587
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:05,233
and you know, I'm just not gonna go there.

588
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,747
- Biden also expresses confidence

589
00:23:07,747 --> 00:23:09,373
in defeating President Trump.

590
00:23:09,373 --> 00:23:11,510
A new Quinnipiac University national poll

591
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:15,723
shows his 42% lead in that category.

592
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:21,240
- The idea that I'd be
intimidated by Donald Trump,

593
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,870
he's the bully that I knew my whole life.

594
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,550
He's the bully that
I've always stood up to.

595
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,630
He's the bully who used to
make fun when I was a kid

596
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:32,410
and stuttered and I'd
smack them in the mouth.

597
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,243
- All right, joining me now

598
00:23:33,243 --> 00:23:35,150
is NBC political reporter, Ali Velshi,

599
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:39,570
just in time for this afternoon's
Ali V segment, Ali Vitali.

600
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:41,210
I guess that would be your name.

601
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:42,760
I'd be Ali Velshi.

602
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,593
It gets confusing.

603
00:23:43,593 --> 00:23:44,680
- It's okay.
- Ali V,

604
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:48,537
talk to me about Harris's
campaign talking about

605
00:23:48,537 --> 00:23:53,200
what Joe Biden said, saying
this wasn't an attack.

606
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,700
- Well, it clearly was an attack.

607
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,020
And I think that they were
definitely prepared for it.

608
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,550
You and I have talked about this before.

609
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:01,200
And Lily Adams was on CNN
today basically saying

610
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,630
the fact that he wasn't prepared for it,

611
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:04,130
she's not quite sure why that happened,

612
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:06,450
but the Kamala Harris campaign came in,

613
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:07,810
and this is what debates are,

614
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:10,740
to kind of separate the field
and show the differences.

615
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,510
I do think that there's a
reticence on Joe Biden's part

616
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:16,070
to be apologetic for his past record.

617
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:19,410
And it's difficult to run on
this argument of electability

618
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:22,240
and experience when you're
not really ready to defend

619
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,040
the experience portion of it,
specifically when you look

620
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,540
at 30 years of policymaking decisions.

621
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,620
Things look different
over the course of time.

622
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,730
And I covered a candidate

623
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:32,970
who was reticent to apologize in the past.

624
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:34,670
Joe Biden is not Donald Trump.

625
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:37,190
And so I think that this is
a strategy that I'm not sure

626
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:39,350
how effective it's going
to be going down the line

627
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:42,210
in this campaign as there are
gonna be a lot more policies

628
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:44,070
that come up about Joe Biden's past

629
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:46,520
that the other candidates
are gonna want to litigate.

630
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,540
- Harris, the polling
that we were showing,

631
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,870
seems to be closing the gap.

632
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:51,400
That new Quinnipiac University poll

633
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,930
shows her numbers have surged 13 points.

634
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:55,890
Joe Biden's have surged eight points.

635
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:58,695
But in a different question,
when people are asked

636
00:24:58,695 --> 00:25:02,840
who can beat Donald Trump,
Joe Biden's still way ahead.

637
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,500
I guess to some degree, Kamala
Harris taking on Joe Biden

638
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,280
in that debate was about showing

639
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,760
I can beat a front runner.

640
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,593
- Maybe.

641
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:11,750
I think that for a lot of the candidates

642
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,940
on that stage with Joe
Biden, the reason why

643
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,950
the conventional thinking
was that it's a good thing

644
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:18,650
to share the debate stage
with him is because obviously,

645
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:19,940
a lot of eyes are looking at him.

646
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,790
When you're coming into
this race as Joe Biden

647
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:24,570
or Bernie Sanders, you have
a high name recognition.

648
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:26,970
So that's why I think in a
lot of these early polls,

649
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:28,940
you're seeing them so far out ahead.

650
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,640
They have leads now to defend.

651
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,640
For the other candidates,

652
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,410
it's a matter of introducing themselves

653
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:35,340
to an electorate that may not be aware

654
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,780
of all these other candidates
that are in the race now.

655
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,920
And so when you see
these polls tightening,

656
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,950
I actually don't know

657
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:43,920
that it's rising levels of
support and not support.

658
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,270
I actually think it's just
the electorate tuning in

659
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:49,252
and showing that they're becoming
aware of different people.

660
00:25:49,252 --> 00:25:50,900
I think that as we get
further down the line,

661
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,640
we're gonna see a debate in
July, a debate in September,

662
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,160
that's when we're gonna start to see

663
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,210
a lot more of the awareness
coming into the polls.

664
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:58,460
After that, I'd feel comfortable

665
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,320
looking at polls and saying,

666
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,840
all right, these are
trends that are sticking.

667
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,960
- Yeah, this is for us right now,

668
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,888
people who watch this all the time

669
00:26:03,888 --> 00:26:05,010
as opposed to the public.
- Exactly.

670
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:07,990
- Okay, my executive producer
informs me you're Ali Vitali.

671
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:09,090
I'm Ali Velshi.

672
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:09,923
- I've heard that, yeah.

673
00:26:09,923 --> 00:26:11,470
- This was the Ali V segment.

674
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,560
Good to see you, my friend.

675
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,393
- You too.

676
00:26:13,393 --> 00:26:15,210
- Joe Biden and Kamala Harris
will pause their fight,

677
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:17,370
by the way, over past education policy

678
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:20,940
to talk about the current state
of America's public schools.

679
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,450
They're scheduled to join eight other

680
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,010
Democratic presidential candidates

681
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:26,240
at the National Education Association's

682
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,820
Strong Public Schools
Presidential Forum in Houston.

683
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,620
The contenders will answer
questions from classroom teachers

684
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,463
and other educational professionals.

685
00:26:34,463 --> 00:26:39,010
MSNBC's Mariana Atencio
joins us now from Houston.

686
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:41,550
The forum is going to begin
at the top of the hour.

687
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:44,040
Mariana, some of the
candidates have outlined plans

688
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,410
to improve the education
system, and you've had a chance

689
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:49,230
to talk with educators
who are at the event.

690
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:50,160
What are they looking for?

691
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,810
What are the attendees looking for

692
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,460
from the presidential candidates?

693
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:59,110
- Ali, educators want to
know from the candidates

694
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:02,040
how they plan to increase
teacher pay, first of all.

695
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,080
We've seen teachers, for the most part,

696
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,230
rally and strike across the country

697
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:08,050
for increased teacher pay,

698
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:10,240
but also how the candidates
are going to increase

699
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,460
funding for education, how
they're gonna make educators

700
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,800
stay in the classroom.

701
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,290
Many teachers here tell
me they have to work

702
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:20,160
two, three jobs just to be an educator,

703
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,860
and they're having to put their own money

704
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:24,740
toward buying textbooks
and school supplies.

705
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,340
So how these candidates

706
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:29,180
are gonna improve
conditions in classrooms.

707
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,850
But it also goes beyond education.

708
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:35,280
I spoke to one teacher named
Christina from Denver, Colorado

709
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:39,170
who tells me she has a
classroom of mixed status kids,

710
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:40,720
a lot of Latino families.

711
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,410
So she's also interested to know

712
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,870
about the candidates'
immigration proposals,

713
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:46,960
because whatever they do on immigration

714
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,190
will inevitably affect
the kids in her classroom.

715
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:53,530
And then finally, what you
were talking about with Ali V.

716
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:57,100
A lot of chatter here about
that contested exchange

717
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,620
over race between Biden and Harris.

718
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,510
A lot of educators also
wanna see what both of them

719
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:05,640
will talk about regarding
that at the forum today.

720
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,473
Ali?

721
00:28:06,473 --> 00:28:07,306
- I appreciate that.

722
00:28:07,306 --> 00:28:08,210
Thank you, my friend, Mariana Atencio.

723
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:10,850
We're gonna check in with
you a little bit later.

724
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:11,800
And a quick programming note.

725
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,370
In the next hour, I'm
gonna be talking live

726
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:14,327
to Senator Amy Klobuchar.

727
00:28:14,327 --> 00:28:16,410
She's one of the 2020 contenders

728
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:18,840
who is attending today's forum in Houston.

729
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,370
We are going to talk about
her public education policies.

730
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:25,540
That is three p.m. Eastern
right here on MSNBC.

731
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,930
All right, the President says
ICE agents will soon begin

732
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:30,340
a nationwide roundup of
undocumented immigrants

733
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:33,950
and claim border
facilities are clean, fine

734
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:37,640
and only overcrowded because of Democrats.

735
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,870
Texas Democratic Congressman Marc Veasey,

736
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,442
who toured border facilities,

737
00:28:41,442 --> 00:28:43,780
detention facilities
this week, joins me next.

738
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,303
You're watching MSNBC.

739
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,070
- Choosing to foster a
child is choosing to nurture

740
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:54,890
and emotionally support
children in urgent need.

741
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:56,940
It's not just about opening up your home.

742
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,270
It is also about opening up your heart.

743
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,030
Consider fostering.

744
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:01,930
The more you know.

with new Pepto Bismol Liquicaps.

754
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,920
- My team spent a lot of
time and money posting jobs.

755
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,670
We would get a flood of resumes,

756
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:25,670
but finding the right person
was nearly impossible.

757
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:28,380
My budget has to stretch,
but my time can't.

758
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,300
I was tired of using 12 vendors.

759
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,720
Then I learned that
CareerBuilder has everything,

760
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,090
data to help us plan, a single
source to find candidates,

marketing tools to engage them,

762
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,390
and the fastest background
screening on the market.

763
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:41,610
So we made the switch.

764
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,680
Now, we get the right person faster.

765
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,390
It's not just efficient.

766
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:46,940
It's smart.

767
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,320
CareerBuilder, work can work.

812
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:36,010
If you're driving without an auto warranty

00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:38,620

of expensive auto repairs
that could cost you thousands.

815

- [Announcer] With a
mattress at Casper.com.

835
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:36,780
- Well, don't call them raids.

836
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,880
I say they came in illegally,

837
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,530
and we're bringing them out legally.

838
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:42,470
These are people where we have the papers,

839
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:44,300
we've gone through the court system.

840
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,190
They'll be starting fairly soon,

841
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,850
but I don't call 'em raids.

842
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:51,530
Thousands and thousands of
people will be legally removed

843
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:54,000
from the country, and
that process has started.

844
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,930
And we've actually been
doing that for a long time.

845
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:58,610
- President Trump announced
he'd be carrying out

846
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:01,330
his initiative to round up and mass deport

847
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,110
thousands of undocumented migrants

848
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:05,320
back to their home countries fairly soon.

849
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,480
This comes almost two
weeks after he called of

850
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,247
threatened raids to, "see if
the Democrats and Republicans

851
00:33:10,247 --> 00:33:13,607
"can get together and work
out a solution to the asylum

852
00:33:13,607 --> 00:33:15,740
"and loophole problems
at the southern border."

853
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:18,370
But a week later at the G20 summit,

854
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:21,030
he said immigration raids
would likely take place

855
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:23,710
sometime after the July 4th holiday.

856
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,186
It comes just as more reports
reveal that the administration

857
00:33:26,186 --> 00:33:30,745
has been sending heft fines
of up to nearly $500,000

858
00:33:30,745 --> 00:33:34,180
to migrants who seek refuge
in places of warship.

859

Joining me now is Democratic
representative from Texas,

860
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:39,600
Marc Veasey, who traveled
to El Paso to visit

861
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,610
several detention facilities in the area.

862
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:42,470
Congressman, good to see you.

863
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:43,840
Thank you for being with us.

864
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,673
- Ali.

865
00:33:44,673 --> 00:33:45,960
- The President has implied

866
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,780
that what congressmen are seeing,

867
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,190
either they're being dishonest about it

868
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,500
or they're not actually seeing.

869
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,380
What have you seen?

870
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:55,550
And how does that compare
to what other congressmen

871
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,630
have told us, other members
of Congress have told us,

872
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:00,450
and our own reporters have
seen about overcrowding,

873
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:03,350
and the shortage of food and
blankest and things like that?

874
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,183
- Right, exactly.

875
00:34:04,183 --> 00:34:08,340
Well, I was on the trip to
El Paso several days ago,

876
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:11,620
and we visited one of the
detention centers there

877
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,590
that was under a lot of scrutiny.

878
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:17,380
And what we saw was at
least one holding cell

879
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,213
that was crowded.

880
00:34:18,213 --> 00:34:21,140
And they had Cuban
migrants that were placed

881
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,640
in this particular cell, and they told us

882
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,390
the reason why they were
in such an overcrowded cell

883
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:27,690
was because the Cubans didn't mix well

884
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:30,440
with the other people from
Latin American countries.

885
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,190
So they wanted to keep
them together in that cell.

886
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,490
They were crying.

887
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:35,780
They were sad.

888
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,710
One grandmother told a story

889
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:42,170
of her mentally impaired grandson
being separated from her.

890
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:45,430
And they did tell
members of the delegation

891
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:47,650
that when they asked for water,

892
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:50,450
that they were told to
drink out of the toilet.

893
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:52,820
Now, you know, I have to tell you,

894
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:56,530
based on this Facebook page that came out,

895
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:58,170
and that story actually broke

896
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:00,340
while we were on our trip to El Paso,

897
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:03,870
I believe that the Border Patrol
agents did tell them that.

898
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:06,430
I absolutely believe that they've
been mean to this people--

899
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:07,870
- Tell me the connection between the two,

900
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:11,100
because you know that there
are almost 10,000 people

901
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,610
on this Facebook page
in which it has Customs

902
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:16,820
and Border Protection
employees and officers

903
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:20,280
saying disparaging, sexist,
racist, misogynistic things

904
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,460
about both members of
Congress, and migrants,

905
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:27,380
asylum seekers, even
people crossing the river.

906
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,213
- Right, yes.

907
00:35:28,213 --> 00:35:30,903
I think it's a broader
part of the culture there.

908
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,000
Now, it's actually broken that they have

909
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,450
actually known about this page

910
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:38,430
perhaps for up to three years,

911
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,870
and they were not surprised about this.

912
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:42,520
When we got there and we talked

913
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,400
with the Customs and Border Patrol people

914
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,967
that were in charge of
our tour, they told us,

915
00:35:45,967 --> 00:35:47,750
"Oh, my god, we've never heard of this."

916
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:49,790
But come on, three years?

917
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:52,540
If that's true, then that
means that we were lied to,

918
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,040
that members of Congress where lied to

919
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,070
on the trip about this page.

920
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:59,300
And again, the fact that
they would be mean to people

921
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,040
and that there were kids that
were in overcrowded conditions

922
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,590
that were walking around
with mucus-filled shirts,

923
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:08,290
stories that were told to us,
stories that, in my opinion,

924
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:10,210
were backed up the the IG's report,

925
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:13,250
and even the acting Homeland Secretary

926
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:16,850
said that the conditions
there are not good,

927
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:20,090
I mean, everything that
I've heard from the migrants

928
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:23,020
while I was there on my
trip, I 100% believe.

929
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:25,468
- Congressman, the President
talked about it this morning.

930
00:36:25,468 --> 00:36:29,440
He says members of Congress
are attacking Border Patrol.

931
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,273
Let's listen.

932
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:33,440
- I've seen some of those places,

933
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,210
and they are run beautifully.

934
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:36,600
They're clean.

935
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,780
They're good.

936
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,223
They do a great job.

937
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:41,950
They do a great job.

938
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:45,240
They're crowded because the
Democrats will not give us

939
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,770
any relief from these loopholes.

940
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:48,960
We have loopholes that are so bad,

941
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,870
we have asylum that's so bad.

942
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,780
I think that the Border
Patrol has been treated

943
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:57,260
very, very badly by certain
members of Congress,

944
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,610
very, very badly.

945
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:01,120
For the most part, they're
very respected by Congress,

946
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,370
but certain members of Congress

947
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:07,320
say very bad things
and lie and exaggerate.

948
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,660
- So what do you have to
say about that, Congressman?

949
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,170
He's saying that certain
members of Congress

950
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:12,190
lie and exaggerate.

951
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:14,850
But in fact, this Border Patrol stuff

952
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:16,720
wasn't actually reported
by members of Congress.

953
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,170
It was reported by somebody in that group

954
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,510
who linked it to ProPublica.

955
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:23,190
- Yeah, that is absolutely right.

956
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:26,190
And you know, the President
has never seen a lie

957
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,570
that he didn't like.

958
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:29,450
And right now, he's just spinning.

959
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:30,500
He's playing politics

960
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,560
like he's been playing
politics with these migrants.

961
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:38,560
And absolutely, Ali, everything
that I've heard about

962
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:44,380
and everything that the President has,

963
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,470
you know, he's trying to almost

964
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:48,378
like pit the Border Patrol agents

965
00:37:48,378 --> 00:37:50,480
and try to make this a political issue.

966
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,850
But I will tell you that there was another

967
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:56,440
Border Patrol agent, you
may have saw the interview,

968
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,840
and he even backed up
the deplorable conditions

969
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,410
in which the migrants were living in.

970
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:02,440
And so I don't see this

971
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,740
as an issue of Democrats
versus Border Patrol agents.

972
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:09,470
I think that there are some
agents there that feel like,

973
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:12,220
that they are empowered to do
anything that they wanna do

974
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:14,440
because of the direction that they get

975
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,460
from the executive branch,
from the statements

976
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,720
that come out of the President's mouth,

977
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,110
from the actions that come out

978
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:23,930
of the President's
immigration policy people

979
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:24,860
like Stephen Miller.

980
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:27,410
I think that that sort of culture

981
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:28,730
has been allowed to exist there.

982
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:33,270
But I, by no means, think
that every Border Patrol agent

983
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,430
is a bad person.

984
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:38,180
We even heard from
lawyers and other people,

985
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:41,950
before we began our tour
in El Paso, that wanted

986
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:43,950
to let us know that some of
these Border Patrol agents

987
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:46,500
are members of the
community in good standing.

988
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,690
We work with them, that they
were part of their families,

989
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:50,820
and that they certainly

990
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,610
did not paint them with a broad brush.

991
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:54,430
And I'm not trying to do that right now.

992
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:56,120
I'm saying that they have a problem there

993
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,220
and it needs to be rooted out.

994
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,431
And I'm very happy that Elijah Cummings

995
00:38:59,431 --> 00:39:03,590
is going to hold a hearing on
oversight and investigation

996
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:05,860
so we can look into some
of these allegations.

997
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,490
Not just with the Facebook page,

998
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:09,200
with the overcrowding conditions.

999
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,140
Congressman, good to talk to you.

1000
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,740
Thank you for taking
time to discuss with us,

1001
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:15,040
Representative Marc Veasey of Texas.

1002
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:15,873
All right, coming up next,

1003
00:39:15,873 --> 00:39:18,140
tensions with Iran go from bad to worse.

1004
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:21,250
This time, it's Tehran and
the UK in the crosshairs

1005
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:24,840
after the British Royal Navy
seized an Iranian oil tanker.

1006
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,990
Today, new threats of
retaliation from Iran.

1007
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,983
You are watching MSNBC.

1008
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:35,760
- So how are you feeling
on a scale of one to five?

1009
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,840
One to five?

1010
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,280
It's more like five million.

1011
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,830
There's everything from happy,

1012
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:41,900
to extremely happy.

1013
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:42,880
There's also angry.

1014
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,880
- Really angry, Clive!

1015
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,050
- Actually really angry.

1016
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,091
- Thank you.

1017
00:39:46,091 --> 00:39:47,080
- But what if your business can understand

1018
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,660
what your customers are feeling

1019
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,120
and then do something about it?

1020
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,200
Turn problems into opportunities.

1021
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,033
- Thanks, drone.

1022
00:39:53,033 --> 00:39:54,260
- Customers into fanatics.

1023
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,600
Change the whole experience.

1024
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,352
- All right, who wants to go again?

1025
00:39:57,352 --> 00:39:58,641
(passengers chatter)
- I do!

1026
00:39:58,641 --> 00:39:59,859
I do!

1027
00:39:59,859 --> 00:40:02,330
- [Clive] I have a really
good feeling about this.

1028
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:03,900
- It's quite the buffet
at this hotel, isn't it?

1029
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:04,870
- It really is.

1030
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:06,198
- And so close to the stadium.

1031
00:40:06,198 --> 00:40:09,320
I managed to book the
last room for 150 bucks.

1032
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,350
- I booked the last
room a few months back.

1033
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:13,260
- Booked the last room a week ago.

1034
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,500
- I booked yesterday, one night, $99.

1035
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,481
- [Group] What?

1036
00:40:16,481 --> 00:40:17,314
- How?

1037
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:18,200
- Some hotel booking sites panic you

1038
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,530
into booking the last room,

1039
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:21,280
but they often don't have
all the availability.

1040
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,113
Instead, use Trivago.

1041
00:40:22,113 --> 00:40:24,180
Trivago will search for available rooms

1042
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,500
and compare hotel prices

1043
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,100
from hundreds of websites worldwide.

1044
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,970
- At least I got the
last ticket to the game.

1045
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:30,350
- [Group] Me too.

1046
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:31,380
- [Announcer] Hotel?

1047
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,350
Trivago.

1048
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:33,400

00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:58,060
- That, that's not me.

1104
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:59,030
That's HomeAdvisor.

1105
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:00,810
- [Announcer] You can't expect
your neighbors to do it all,

1106
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:02,543
so just ask HomeAdvisor.

1107
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:07,010
- Iran has threatened to
seize a British oil tanker

1108
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:08,400
after authorities in Gibraltar

1109
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,260
detained an Iranian
oil tanker on Thursday.

1110
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:14,300
The British say the ship
breached European Union sanctions

1111
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:17,510
by carrying a shipment
of crude oil to Syria.

1112
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:18,720
Iranian authorities believe

1113
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,390
the British were acting on intelligence

1114
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:23,060
from the United States
when they seized the ship.

1115
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:25,280
The latest incident comes
as Iranian President

1116
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,920
Hassan Rouhani said that
his country will begin

1117
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,270
enriching Uranium as early as Sunday

1118
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:32,600
to a level that would exceed the limits

1119
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:36,470
specified under the 2015 Nuclear Accord.

1120
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:39,650
Let's bring in NBC's Tehran
Bureau Chief, Ali Arouzi

1121
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:41,290
live from Tehran.

1122
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:45,700
Ali, this is a tricky one
because much of the Syrian regime

1123
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:48,230
despised around the world
and even in the region

1124
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:51,710
is supported by the Iranians,
so it would be logical,

1125
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:54,240
to some people, to think
that Iran is supplying

1126
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,170
oil to Syria.

1127
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:58,220
What do we know about what happened here?

1128
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:04,901
- Well, Ali, what we know is
that this was the (mumbles)

1129
00:44:04,901 --> 00:44:06,937
that Iran says that they earned.

1130
00:44:06,937 --> 00:44:10,870
And it was taking crude oil to Syria,

1131
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:14,580
but it was taking a very
curious route to Syria.

1132
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:16,680
Instead of going through the Suez Canal,

1133
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:20,760
which would be a massive
shortcut for this supertanker

1134
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:24,122
to take, it went around the tip of Africa,

1135
00:44:24,122 --> 00:44:28,760
all the way up towards the
Mediterranean coast of Syria,

1136
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:33,760
where it was seized in
Gibraltar by British Marines.

1137
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:36,910
Now, it's very odd that
it would take this route.

1138
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:39,310
Now some people are saying
that this may have been

1139
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:42,900
a smokescreen by the Iranians
to disguise its route

1140
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:45,580
because it's not allowed
to take oil to Syria

1141
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:47,950
because of EU sanctions.

1142
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:52,470
And the British were tipped
off by the United States

1143
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:54,930
that this cargo was heading to Syria,

1144
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:59,420
and some 30 British Marines
then boarded the ship.

1145
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:02,660
They boarded it by ropes
coming down on helicopters,

1146
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:05,230
while others came on speedboats.

1147
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:08,810
And now, the ship is being
held in Gibraltar waters.

1148
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:11,400
The crew of the ship are being questioned.

1149
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,320
It's not clear whether
they're being questioned

1150
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,150
on land or on the sea.

1151
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:17,060
And incidentally, most of the crew

1152
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:20,100
are Pakistanis and Indians, not Iranians.

1153
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,380
They're not being treated as criminals

1154
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,300
but rather as witnesses.

1155
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:27,200
Now, the authorities
in Gibraltar have said

1156
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,370
that they are gonna keep the
ship for another two weeks

1157
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:32,830
until the investigation comes to an end,

1158
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:35,500
but Iran is obviously up in arms.

1159
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,260
They are saying that
this is an act of piracy

1160
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:42,190
by the British, and an Iranian commander,

1161
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:45,070
revolutionary guard commander is saying

1162
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:48,840
that a British oil tanker
should be seized in retaliation.

1163
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,550
- All right, Ali Arouzi,
thank you so much,

1164
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:52,810
NBC News Tehran Bureau Chief Ali Arouzi.

1165
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:53,800
The situation with Iran

1166
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:56,320
is just one of several
foreign policy crises

1167
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,010
that President Trump is dealing with.

1168
00:45:58,010 --> 00:45:59,730
The President is also
trying to reach an agreement

1169
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:01,440
with China to end his trade war

1170
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,030
and a deal with North Korea
to curb its nuclear program.

1171
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:06,790
While Democrats and some
Republicans have criticized

1172
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:09,510
the President's handling
of foreign policy issues,

1173
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:11,660
his core supporters still appear

1174
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:13,550
to be onboard with his efforts.

1175
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:15,830
Joining us to take a closer
look at this is Henry Olsen.

1176
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:17,520
Henry is a senior fellow

1177
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,580
at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.

1178
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:22,060
He's also an opinion columnist
for The Washington Post,

1179
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:24,010
and he wrote a column on this issue

1180
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:25,710
that was published last week.

1181
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:26,543
Henry, good to see you.

1182
00:46:26,543 --> 00:46:27,660
Thank you for being with us.

1183
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:28,510
- Thanks for having me on.

1184
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:31,070
- Henry, I wanna read a
little bit from this column

1185
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:33,597
that you published in which
you say about Donald Trump,

1186
00:46:33,597 --> 00:46:36,597
"His fans, not surprisingly,
take a different view.

1187
00:46:36,597 --> 00:46:39,957
"Most don't subscribe to the
Trump as Superman fantasy.

1188
00:46:39,957 --> 00:46:43,077
"Instead, they recognize that experts

1189
00:46:43,077 --> 00:46:45,787
"have been in charge of US
foreign policy for decades

1190
00:46:45,787 --> 00:46:48,177
"and, they argue, we have
little to show for it.

1191
00:46:48,177 --> 00:46:49,967
"North Korea has nuclear weapons.

1192
00:46:49,967 --> 00:46:53,827
"China has emerged as a
dangerous geopolitical foe.

1193
00:46:53,827 --> 00:46:56,597
"In their view, Trump's
dramatic breaks with the past

1194
00:46:56,597 --> 00:46:59,467
"could be the only chance
the United States has

1195
00:46:59,467 --> 00:47:03,527
"to avert dangerous conflicts
with one or both nations.

1196
00:47:03,527 --> 00:47:05,897
"Better to take a chance
on him, they reason,

1197
00:47:05,897 --> 00:47:09,783
"than hope more of the same
will yield different results."

1198
00:47:09,783 --> 00:47:12,540
I think that's a remarkably
sophisticated view

1199
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:13,940
of what might be happening.

1200
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:18,060
Do you think that Donald
Trump's base holds that view

1201
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:20,970
of how he handles foreign affairs?

1202
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:24,230
- I think the President's base
is very supportive of him.

1203
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:26,650
They think he has America's
best interests at heart.

1204
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:28,776
They think that he's
not going to be somebody

1205
00:47:28,776 --> 00:47:32,390
who sends American boys and girls to die

1206
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:34,110
for an ally's interest,

1207
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:36,780
that's not immediately
in America's interest.

1208
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:39,980
And I think they are willing

1209
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:42,820
to take some pain or take some risks

1210
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:45,021
in order to confront
Chian and North Korea.

1211
00:47:45,021 --> 00:47:48,620
The polls have shown for
years that being critical

1212
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:51,730
towards China is a winner,
particularly in the Midwest

1213
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:53,620
and particularly with eh people who moved

1214
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:56,500
from Democratic to Republican
to support President Trump.

1215
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,150
So I think they're supportive of him,

1216
00:47:58,150 --> 00:48:00,460
and I think they're willing
to give him a lot of rope

1217
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:01,960
and give them a lot of opportunities

1218
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,110
to show that he's doing the right thing.

1219
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:04,360
- So in both of these cases,

1220
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,830
a lot of rope has been
been ceded, in fact.

1221
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:09,910
In China, we've been reporting
on farmers who are suffering

1222
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:12,320
because their crop prices are low.

1223
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,153
They've been getting

1224
00:48:13,153 --> 00:48:14,270
some reimbursements from the government.

1225
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:16,307
But every last farmer we talked to says,

1226
00:48:16,307 --> 00:48:18,190
"I'd rather have money from my crops."

1227
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:19,240
Yet, you're right.

1228
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,090
When we talked to them,

1229
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:21,980
they say, "We're still
sticking by the President."

1230
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:24,430
When does that run out, that goodwill?

1231
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:28,650
- Well, I think it may
not run out very quickly.

1232
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:30,840
I think you've got people who recognize

1233
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,630
that this has been a long time coming.

1234
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:36,600
China ceded to the WTO
almost 20 years ago.

1235
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,760
Millions of people have lost their jobs,

1236
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:43,650
according to MIT and University
of San Diego economists,

1237
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:45,920
because of Chinese import competition.

1238
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,700
And the fact that some
farmers are losing money,

1239
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:50,626
they can look around and see

1240
00:48:50,626 --> 00:48:52,200
that their neighbors lost
a lot more than they did.

1241
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,500
So I think that as long
as the President is firm

1242
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,520
and as long as the
President is consistent,

1243
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,600
that the rope they give
him may be extended

1244
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,942
for quite a while longer.

1245
00:48:59,942 --> 00:49:04,543
- I mean, these farmers live
on a razor's edge of margins.

1246
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:07,790
Are you saying that it
might be another year or two

1247
00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:09,600
that they'll stick by the President?

1248
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:10,970
- I think it depends.

1249
00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:12,410
It depends on what the President does.

1250
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:13,650
But the thing to remember is that

1251
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:16,970
the farmers receive a lot
of government support.

1252
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:19,136
They receive revenue support,

1253
00:49:19,136 --> 00:49:22,280
the soybean farmers in
particular and corn farmers

1254
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:25,350
are able to buy into a
government-financed insurance program

1255
00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:27,480
that guarantees their revenues.

1256
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,450
Plus they have a price support program.

1257
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:31,530
Plus they have a disaster program.

1258
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:35,220
This is a group that may prefer
to sell to steady markets

1259
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:37,820
but they have a lot of
support from the government,

1260
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:39,480
plus the temporary support

1261
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,130
that the President has been adding

1262
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:44,206
to see them through over
the next couple of years.

1263
00:49:44,206 --> 00:49:45,260
- Henry, good to talk to you.

1264
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:46,900
We'll continue this
conversation another time.

1265
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:47,733
We appreciate it.

1266
00:49:47,733 --> 00:49:48,566
- Thank you.
- Henry Olsen

1267
00:49:48,566 --> 00:49:49,830
is Vice President and Director

1268
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:51,510
at the National Research Initiative.

1269
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:54,010
All right, today, good news
from the monthly jobs report.

1270
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:55,640
200,000 jobs were added,

1271
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,760
further proof our economy is strong.

1272
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,060
But why doesn't it seem to
be working for everyone?

1273
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:02,760
That is the big question.

1274
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,233
You're watching MSNBC.

1275
00:50:08,271 --> 00:50:10,110
- [Announcer] Have you ever
seen something so beautiful

1276
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:12,520
that all you could say was, "Wow!"

1277
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,660
Beaches Turks & Caicos,
where anything is possible

1278
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:17,700
because everything is included.

1279
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:18,533
Wow.

1280
00:50:18,533 --> 00:50:20,210
Get up to 65% off.

1281
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:22,382
Call 1-800-Beaches.

1282
00:50:22,382 --> 00:50:25,010
- I have one kid in each
branch of the military,

1283
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:26,338
but I'm command central.

1284
00:50:26,338 --> 00:50:27,970
- [Announcer] Why Elaine chose Verizon.

1285
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:29,240
- It's so important to us

1286
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,590
that Verizon is supporting
military families.

1287
00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:32,910
When I have a child deployed,

1288
00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:35,100
having a reliable
network means everything.

1289
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:37,790
So when I get a video chat
and I get to see their face,

1290
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:39,010
it's the best thing in the world.

1291
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:41,000
And I've earned every
one of these gray hairs.

1292
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,110
Military moms, we serve too.

1293
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:44,500
- [Announcer] The network
more people rely on

1294
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:45,350
gives you more,

1295
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:47,927
like military plans with a
special price on unlimited,

1296
00:50:47,927 --> 00:50:50,140
$100 per line, and big savings

1297
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:51,720
on our best phones when you switch.

1298
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:52,770
That's Verizon.

1299
00:50:52,770 --> 00:50:54,070
- When I book at hilton.com,

1300
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:56,130
I get to select my room
from the floor plan,

1301
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:58,710
free Wi-Fi, and a price match guarantee.

1302
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:00,340
- So with Hilton, there is no catch.

1303
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:02,810
- Yeah, the only catch is
I'm never leaving. (chuckles)

1304
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:03,643
No, I'm serious.

1305
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:04,664
I live here now.

1306
00:51:04,664 --> 00:51:07,834
Book at hilton.com and get the
Hilton price match guarantee.

1307
00:51:07,834 --> 00:51:09,370
- No, wrong move.

1308
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:11,220
Old-fashioned bandages get dirty.

1309
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:12,820
They can let in water and germs.

1310
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:14,490
Look, it's falling off.

1311
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:16,990
New-Skin is the flexible liquid bandage

1312
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:18,510
that seals out the bad stuff.

1313
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:20,330
There's a spray too.

1314
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:22,690
- [Announcer] New-Skin,
rethink how you heal.

1315
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:24,510
- It's so easy to sell on Poshmark.

1316
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:27,010
You just pick out your item,
snap a couple of photos,

1317
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:28,310
and boom, it's up for sale.

1318
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:30,800
When I look at my old clothes
now, I see dollar signs

1319
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,670
just this month, I made a
couple of hundred dollars

1320
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:35,110
on Poshmark just selling
items out of my closet.

1321
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:37,560
- [Announcer] Download
the free Poshmark app now.

1322
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:42,210
- The United States is
in its longest period

1323
00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:45,760
of economic expansion on record,
but there is a widening gap

1324
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,446
between the richest
Americans and everyone else.

1325
00:51:48,446 --> 00:51:52,170
Now much of that has to do
with wealth and the ability

1326
00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:55,610
for the middle class of
America to attain it.

1327
00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:56,800
Let's just discuss what this is.

1328
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:57,660
Wealth are your assets.

1329
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:59,310
I think everybody knows this, your home,

1330
00:51:59,310 --> 00:52:02,100
your durable goods like your
TVs, your refrigerators,

1331
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:06,230
any stocks you own, pension
plans, if you own a business.

1332
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:08,570
All that minus your liabilities,

1333
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:11,030
things like your mortgage,
credit card debt,

1334
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:12,960
car payments, things like
that, that's your wealth,

1335
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,450
your assets minus your
liabilities, your balance sheet.

1336
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:18,570
More than a third of
gains in household wealth

1337
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:21,700
went to the wealthiest
1% over the past decade.

1338
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:23,447
This actually goes all the way to 1989.

1339
00:52:23,447 --> 00:52:27,897
And you can see the top 1%
here and the bottom 50% here

1340
00:52:27,897 --> 00:52:30,950
were in unison until the mid '90s.

1341
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:31,860
Remember, that's when China

1342
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:33,500
joined the World Trade Organization.

1343
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,240
We started buying more stuff from them.

1344
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:37,560
Globalization and technology took hold.

1345
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,310
And you start to see what that did.

1346
00:52:39,310 --> 00:52:41,760
The top 1% ended up with these gains.

1347
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:45,200
The chart shows the fourth
quarter total net worth

1348
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:50,200
of the top 1% of wealth
holders and the bottom 50%.

1349
00:52:50,290 --> 00:52:52,830
These figures, by the way,
are in millions of dollars.

1350
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:55,280
As you can see, the bottom 50%

1351
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,650
barely, barely making any gains at all.

1352
00:52:57,650 --> 00:52:59,800
In fact, for a little
while here in the 2000s,

1353
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,260
they were making negative gains.

1354
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:02,890
They were losing wealth.

1355
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:06,144
Okay, what's causing
this dramatic disparity?

1356
00:53:06,144 --> 00:53:10,400
The Associated Press analyzed
that few middle class owners

1357
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,800
or fewer middle class
Americans are owning homes.

1358
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:18,010
The price gains if you own a
home has made home ownership

1359
00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:19,960
less feasible for new buyers.

1360
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,100
So if you had a home, you've done well.

1361
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:23,800
If you didn't have a home,

1362
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,470
the prices have made it hard to get in.

1363
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:27,040
But then the recession occurred

1364
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:30,220
and nearly eight million
Americans lost their homes.

1365
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:33,400
Since then, prices have
again risen dramatically

1366
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,760
in places like wealthy metro areas,

1367
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,660
especially along the coast.

1368
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:40,860
In 2004, middle class home ownership rates

1369
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:42,580
stood at about 70%.

1370
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:46,420
In 2016, we're now at about 60%.

1371
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:47,990
So that's one area of wealth.

1372
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:50,250
There's also the issue
of low participation

1373
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:51,083
in the stock market.

1374
00:53:51,083 --> 00:53:52,690
We talk a lot about the stock market.

1375
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:54,890
The President talks a lot
about the stock market.

1376
00:53:54,890 --> 00:53:57,050
But the proportion of
middle income household

1377
00:53:57,050 --> 00:53:59,780
that own shares has actually declined.

1378
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:04,543
In 2007, 56% of middle class
Americans owned shares.

1379
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:09,240
And by the way, in 2016,
that dropped to 50%.

1380
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:12,090
This decline is attributed
to more middle income workers

1381
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:15,760
taking jobs that don't have
retirement savings plans,

1382
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,700
as well as expenses like
healthcare and student loan debt

1383
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:22,320
which are taking those bills, that money

1384
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,660
that would have gone to investment.

1385
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:27,270
Now compare that investment
rate to the top 10%.

1386
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:30,430
Almost everybody in
the top 10% owns stock.

1387
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:33,200
In 2007, the number was 93%.

1388
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:37,550
It is up to 95% in 2016.

1389
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:39,630
So this is wealth disparity.

1390
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:40,950
Joining me now is Washington Post

1391
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:43,060
economics correspondent Heather Long.

1392
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:46,880
Her recent op ed speaks
directly to this issue.

1393
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,720
And Heather, the simple question
here is that in shorthand,

1394
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,727
if Martians came down to Earth and said,

1395
00:54:52,727 --> 00:54:54,400
"How is your economy doing,"

1396
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,770
the short answer would have to be good.

1397
00:54:56,770 --> 00:54:58,470
And only if they ask a second question

1398
00:54:58,470 --> 00:54:59,303
would you be able to say,

1399
00:54:59,303 --> 00:55:01,847
"But it is really not evenly distributed."

1400
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:03,543
- I think you're right.

1401
00:55:03,543 --> 00:55:06,400
As I traveled the country,
that's exactly what I hear.

1402
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,030
Americans will tell you
that this is definitely

1403
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:12,210
a better economy than
it was in 2008, in '09

1404
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:14,940
during the great
recession, but the next but

1405
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:17,940
out of their mouths is they
still feel a lot of anxiety.

1406
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,970
And in our story today, we call it

1407
00:55:19,970 --> 00:55:24,850
40% of Americans are still
struggling to pay their bills

1408
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:28,130
which seems like a very
unusually high statistic

1409
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:30,810
in a moment when we have
such a low employment rate,

1410
00:55:30,810 --> 00:55:32,730
and the President keeps talking about

1411
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:34,450
a blue collar jobs boom.

1412
00:55:34,450 --> 00:55:35,660
So why do we still have

1413
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:39,420
this bottom 40% that's
still hurting so much.

1414
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:41,360
And there's really two parts to it.

1415
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:43,900
You just walkED through the wealth so well

1416
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:46,580
people don't have as much of
a cushion as they did before.

1417
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:49,950
We have half the population
that has still not recovered

1418
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:51,670
the level of wealth that they had

1419
00:55:51,670 --> 00:55:53,850
just before the great recession.

1420
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,960
So they still don't have
as much of a cushion

1421
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,990
as what they would like
to have in a normal time,

1422
00:55:58,990 --> 00:56:00,990
let alone heading into
any potential downturn.

1423
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:03,410
- And we know that
statistically, but in your piece,

1424
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:06,359
you actually wrote about
that very specifically.

1425
00:56:06,359 --> 00:56:07,600
I'm reading from your piece.

1426
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:10,167
It says, "In discussions with
30 Americans unable to pay

1427
00:56:10,167 --> 00:56:12,967
"all of their bills, a
clear pattern emerged.

1428
00:56:12,967 --> 00:56:16,087
"Most were able to eke by until they faced

1429
00:56:16,087 --> 00:56:19,787
"an unexpected crisis,
such as a job loss, cancer,

1430
00:56:19,787 --> 00:56:21,900
"car trouble, or storm damage."

1431
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:23,110
Or in the case of this year,

1432
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:26,500
we saw with government
employees who were furloughed

1433
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,230
or when the government shut down.

1434
00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:29,630
These are middle income workers.

1435
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:31,550
These are not poor Americans.

1436
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:34,410
But some setback will set them off,

1437
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:36,020
and that means they are constantly living

1438
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:38,937
with a level of anxiety
which will cause them to say,

1439
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:40,997
"I'm not sure whose great
economy you're talking about

1440
00:56:40,997 --> 00:56:43,610
"because I'm scared every month."

1441
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:44,760
- Yeah, that's exactly right.

1442
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:47,670
I think what we've really
learned in the last decade

1443
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:50,270
about people who are in the working class

1444
00:56:50,270 --> 00:56:53,700
is how volatile their situations are.

1445
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:55,310
There's a lot less certainty

1446
00:56:55,310 --> 00:56:57,300
around the hours you're going to work

1447
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:00,360
and how much you're going
to make during those hours.

1448
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:03,610
Retail workers have talked
a lot about how frustrated

1449
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:06,600
they are about not knowing
their schedule week to week.

1450
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:09,890
And on the flip side is
that people not having

1451
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:12,650
that cushion anymore, they
haven't been able to save.

1452
00:57:12,650 --> 00:57:15,550
They haven't been able,
after losing homes,

1453
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:17,880
to get back on that
housing or stock market,

1454
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:20,910
to build back up their
savings and their assets

1455
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:23,610
to weather a rainy day situation.

1456
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:24,800
It's pretty stunning.

1457
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:28,250
I think the Kaiser Foundation
group that studies healthcare

1458
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:30,960
had a pretty incredible statistic.

1459
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,370
It's something like one in six Americans,

1460
00:57:33,370 --> 00:57:35,460
even if they have health insurance,

1461
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:38,310
will face an unexpectedly large bill

1462
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:41,160
that they hadn't planned for every year.

1463
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:41,993
- Heather, good to talk to you.

1464
00:57:41,993 --> 00:57:43,750
Thank you for the story
that you've written.

1465
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:45,300
We'll continue to have this conversation,

1466
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:46,790
because I think it's the most important

1467
00:57:46,790 --> 00:57:48,870
economic conversation of our time.

1468
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:52,230
Heather Long is a Washington
Post economics correspondent.

1469
00:57:52,230 --> 00:57:53,600
Another quick reminder, in a few minutes,

1470
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,470
at the top of the hour,
I'm gonna speak live

1471
00:57:55,470 --> 00:57:57,870
to 2020 contender Senator Amy Klobuchar,

1472
00:57:57,870 --> 00:57:59,960
one of the many Democratic
candidates speaking today

1473
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:01,610
at an educational forum in Houston.

1474
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:02,443
sTick around.

1475
00:58:02,443 --> 00:58:03,610
You don't wanna miss that conversation

1476
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:04,443
in just a few minutes.

1477
00:58:04,443 --> 00:58:06,293
You are watching MSNBC.

1478
00:58:09,523 --> 00:58:12,356
(laid back music)

1479
00:58:28,790 --> 00:58:31,030
- [Announcer] Nothing
feels like connecting

1480
00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:32,633
with the people that matter.

1481
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:36,320
Holiday Inn, Holiday Inn Express.

1482
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,783
We're there so you can be too.

1483
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:44,203
- [Announcer] It all comes down
to a single defining moment,

1484
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:51,603
when a plan stops being a
plan and gets set into motion.

1485
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:55,580
Today's Merrill can help you get there

1486
00:58:56,710 --> 00:59:00,210
with the people, tools
and personalized advice

1487
00:59:00,210 --> 00:59:03,043
to help turn your ambitions into action.

1488
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:06,620
What would you like the power to do?

1489
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:10,770
- What makes Creative Planning

1490
00:59:10,770 --> 00:59:12,780
different from other financial advisers?

1491
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:16,210
aS an independent firm with
over $40 billion in assets,

1492
00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:18,200
We have the experience that you deserve.

1493
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:20,410
And our advisers are always fiduciaries,

1494
00:59:20,410 --> 00:59:22,660
legally bound to act
in your best interest.

1495
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:24,370
And rather than mange your investments

1496
00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:26,600
based solely on age OR risk tolerance,

1497
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,850
we consider your entire financial picture,

1498
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:30,750
including tax and legal plaNning,

1499
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:32,920
to create a complete plan
that's right for you.

1500
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:36,180
So call 866-Creative and
experience the difference.

1501
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:37,330
Creative planning.

1502
00:59:37,330 --> 00:59:40,900
- [Announcer] Men, wanna feel
younger, stronger, leaner?

1503
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:43,210
You don't have to slow down after 40.

1504
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:45,740
Frank Thomas found the
secret to staying in shape

1505
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:47,560
with the energy and drive of his 20s.

1506
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:49,920
- Man, you look like you
could still hit it a mile.

1507
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:50,940
- I feel great too.

1508
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:51,773
- What gives?

1509
00:59:51,773 --> 00:59:53,690
- After 40, men slow down.

1510
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:54,810
It's harder to stay in shape.

1511
00:59:54,810 --> 00:59:55,643
- Why?

1512
00:59:55,643 --> 00:59:57,500
- Our free testosterone levels drop.

1513
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:58,333
It happened to me.

1514
00:59:58,333 --> 01:00:00,600
And then I found Nugenix Total-T.

1515
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:03,210
- [Announcer] New Nugenix
Total-T is our most powerful

1516
01:00:03,210 --> 01:00:05,620
man-boosting formula
ever, because it boosts

1517
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:08,250
your free testosterone and
your total testosterone.

1518
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:10,280
Nugenix Total-T helps provide

1519
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:12,800
even more energy,
performance, testosterone,

1520
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:15,560
and muscle boosting ingredients
for even better results.

1521
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:18,540
To get your complimentary
bottle of Nugenix Total-T,

1522
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:21,080
text LEAN to 231 231.

1523
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:23,140
Samples are not available in stores.

1524
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:25,660
- Why wait when you can
do something about it now?

1525
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:27,520
- I gotta try Nugenix Total-T.

1526
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:30,260
- [Announcer] Text LEAN to 231231 now

1527
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:33,040
for your complementary
bottle of Nugenix Total-T.

1528
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:37,410
That's L-E-A-N to 231231.

1529
01:00:37,410 --> 01:00:39,943
- [Announcer] And stop
overpaying for car insurance.

1530
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:44,140
- All right, it looks like
the longest economic expansion

1531
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,600
in US history is going to continue

1532
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:46,780
at least for the time being.

1533
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:49,540
The Labor Department reported
today that hiring rebounded

1534
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:54,540
in June with employers adding
224,000 new jobs last month.

1535
01:00:55,130 --> 01:00:57,640
That's up from just 72,000 in May,

1536
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:59,630
which was a not very good number.

1537
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:02,060
The unemployment rate ticked up to 3.7%.

1538
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:03,230
That's a sign that more people

1539
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:05,180
are returning to the workforce.

1540
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:06,700
And average hourly earnings were up

1541
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:09,290
just over 3% year over year.

1542
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:11,570
President Trump hailed the
news as he left the White House

1543
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:14,020
to spend the weekend at
his New Jersey golf club.

1544
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,330
- We had great numbers this morning.

1545
01:01:17,330 --> 01:01:19,963
I think it was 224,000 jobs.

1546
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,780
Those were really unexpectedly good.

1547
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:27,060
And our country continues
to do really well,

1548
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:30,313
really, really well, so
we're very happy about it.

1549
01:01:31,330 --> 01:01:32,910
- President Trump may
be happy about the news.

1550
01:01:32,910 --> 01:01:35,140
The markets don't seem to care as much.

1551
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:36,550
Taking a look at the big board,

1552
01:01:36,550 --> 01:01:38,030
we have now at least moved to the point

1553
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:39,520
where we're kind of flat.

1554
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,790
The problem here, of course,
is that a strong jobs number

1555
01:01:41,790 --> 01:01:45,100
means that the Fed may
not lower interest rates,

1556
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:47,430
which is something the Fed
doesn't really seem to wanna do,

1557
01:01:47,430 --> 01:01:49,995
but the President really,
really wants the Fed to do.

1558
01:01:49,995 --> 01:01:53,170
And that's why that's troubling
investors a little bit.

1559
01:01:53,170 --> 01:01:55,340
But again, it's a holiday trading day.

1560
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:56,330
I wouldn't put too much stock

1561
01:01:56,330 --> 01:01:57,620
into anything you see in the market.

1562
01:01:57,620 --> 01:01:58,520
We've got mixed performance.

1563
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:01,250
We've got the NASDAQ up, and
the Dow and the S&P down.

1564
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:03,010
Let's take a closer look at
this with Michael Strain.

1565
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:04,980
He's the director of
economic policy studies

1566
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:07,844
and a resident scholar at the
American Enterprise Institute.

1567
01:02:07,844 --> 01:02:11,760
We would call him a
conservative economist.

1568
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,290
Michael, good to see you, my friend.

1569
01:02:14,290 --> 01:02:16,450
This is a tricky situation
for the President

1570
01:02:16,450 --> 01:02:18,610
because he loves a strong stock market

1571
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:21,880
and he loves low job
numbers, and he's got both

1572
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:26,663
at the moment but he wants the
Fed to lower interest rates.

1573
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:29,783
Is that something that that
just gives the Fed pause?

1574
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:32,930
- Yeah, I think it does
give the Fed pause.

1575
01:02:32,930 --> 01:02:35,532
I think that there's
generally been a lot of hype

1576
01:02:35,532 --> 01:02:37,690
about the path of interest rates

1577
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:41,230
among commentators and on Wall Street.

1578
01:02:41,230 --> 01:02:43,100
Before today's job numbers, you know,

1579
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:46,500
talk of a 50-basis-point
cut or something like that.

1580
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:47,957
I think the Fed,

1581
01:02:47,957 --> 01:02:52,957
well, a lot of the concern about
the slowness of the economy

1582
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:56,523
was based on what we saw
in last month's job number,

1583
01:02:56,523 --> 01:03:00,050
when it was reported that the
economy added 75,000 jobs.

1584
01:03:00,050 --> 01:03:03,090
People were concerned that that
was a market turning point,

1585
01:03:03,090 --> 01:03:06,430
that the economy was slowing,
and perhaps slowing rapidly,

1586
01:03:06,430 --> 01:03:09,870
and the Fed needed to get
out ahead of the economy

1587
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:13,670
and kind of cushion the blow.

1588
01:03:13,670 --> 01:03:16,150
Today, we see a totally different story.

1589
01:03:16,150 --> 01:03:19,390
And I think people overreacted
to last month's news.

1590
01:03:19,390 --> 01:03:22,666
It's important not to
overreact to this month's news.

1591
01:03:22,666 --> 01:03:24,760
What I think we're seeing is an economy

1592
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:28,670
adding about 150 to 180,000 jobs a month,

1593
01:03:28,670 --> 01:03:33,670
slower than in 2018 but
still solid and still steady.

1594
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:35,970
- You wrote an oped for
The Guardian newspaper

1595
01:03:35,970 --> 01:03:37,900
in which you talked about
how with the economy

1596
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:40,630
being in as good a shape
as the data suggests,

1597
01:03:40,630 --> 01:03:43,940
it's a strange time to debate
whether capitalism is broken.

1598
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:45,890
And I think you and I have
had this conversation before.

1599
01:03:45,890 --> 01:03:47,850
It's a conversation I just
had with Heather Long.

1600
01:03:47,850 --> 01:03:50,680
The remarkable wealth
inequality in the United States

1601
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:53,677
and basically around the world
is what's making people say,

1602
01:03:53,677 --> 01:03:56,167
"Hey, I see the stock market
going up all the time.

1603
01:03:56,167 --> 01:03:57,997
"I see home prices going up all the time.

1604
01:03:57,997 --> 01:04:00,560
"I see the strong economy, but my wages,"

1605
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:01,410
particularly for some.

1606
01:04:01,410 --> 01:04:03,210
Maybe it's about a third of Americans,

1607
01:04:03,210 --> 01:04:05,110
they feel left out of this whole thing.

1608
01:04:05,110 --> 01:04:08,010
About a similar percentage of
people in the United Kingdom

1609
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:10,780
feel left out of it, people
in France, people in Germany.

1610
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:13,450
The Arab Spring started
with something very similar

1611
01:04:13,450 --> 01:04:15,977
where people said, "I'm
doing what society said

1612
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:17,567
"I was supposed to do,
and I'm not partaking

1613
01:04:17,567 --> 01:04:20,377
"of the fruits of this
remarkable economic growth."

1614
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:24,120
- Yeah, you know, as I look
into the numbers more and more,

1615
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:25,520
I'm less and less convinced

1616
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:28,040
that inequality is
actually the story here.

1617
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:32,380
If you look from say 1980
until the great recession,

1618
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:35,180
you see a significant
increase in inequality.

1619
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:37,350
If you look over the last 10 years,

1620
01:04:37,350 --> 01:04:39,720
inequality growth has actually flattened,

1621
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:41,340
and it may have even declined

1622
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:45,290
depending on which income
measure you're interested in.

1623
01:04:45,290 --> 01:04:49,780
At the same time as inequality
was soaring during the 1990s,

1624
01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:51,850
people weren't concerned about inequality.

1625
01:04:51,850 --> 01:04:54,130
So I think people actually care about

1626
01:04:54,130 --> 01:04:55,710
how they're doing and--
- Right, right, right.

1627
01:04:55,710 --> 01:04:57,190
So in the '90s, so one of the differences

1628
01:04:57,190 --> 01:04:59,440
was if everybody's sort
of going up at a level,

1629
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:02,100
in hindsight, when we see those numbers,

1630
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:03,760
I don't know if my control
room has the same numbers

1631
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:05,720
that I put up with Heather Long.

1632
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:08,700
If you see over, since
the '80s and the '90s,

1633
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:11,350
when you've got relative, a flatness

1634
01:05:11,350 --> 01:05:14,330
and sometimes even decline
amongst the bottom 50%,

1635
01:05:14,330 --> 01:05:16,480
that doesn't feel like
you're doing better.

1636
01:05:17,790 --> 01:05:18,623
- Yeah, that's right.

1637
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:23,610
And when we had this massive
crisis, this serious recession,

1638
01:05:23,610 --> 01:05:27,790
and then we had a recovery that was slow,

1639
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:32,110
that's typical following
recessions as severe as this one.

1640
01:05:32,110 --> 01:05:33,970
But for years and years and years,

1641
01:05:33,970 --> 01:05:37,780
we had slow and
non-accelerating wage growth.

1642
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:38,613
- [Ali] Right.

1643
01:05:38,613 --> 01:05:40,250
- And over the last few years,

1644
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:42,640
that's changed, thank goodness.

1645
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:47,370
And my sense is that if we
have a long enough period

1646
01:05:47,370 --> 01:05:49,670
where wages for typical workers

1647
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:51,760
are growing at a decent clip,

1648
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:55,463
that some of this concern that
we're seeing will die down.

1649
01:05:56,430 --> 01:05:57,680
- I hear your argument.

1650
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:59,300
Are you worried that given how long

1651
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:02,040
we're into this expansion
that just by natural causes,

1652
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:03,500
it will slow down

1653
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:05,300
and we won't get that
continued wage growth?

1654
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:07,160
Because it's only really since about 2015

1655
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:08,670
that we've seen a nice bump.

1656
01:06:08,670 --> 01:06:11,990
We've seen some of that extra
capacity in the labor market

1657
01:06:11,990 --> 01:06:14,583
go away and people are
actually getting raises.

1658
01:06:15,830 --> 01:06:19,540
- Yeah, I am worried about
that, and that actually

1659
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:21,950
ties in nicely with what
we learned this morning.

1660
01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:24,307
You know, again, a solid month.

1661
01:06:24,307 --> 01:06:28,200
But it seems clear that
2019 is going to be

1662
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:32,030
a slower year for the
labor market than 2018.

1663
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:33,250
You know, one of the reasons

1664
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:35,780
is because we're just
running out of workers

1665
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:37,780
to bring in off the sidelines.

1666
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:40,440
We saw the labor force participation rate

1667
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:42,390
tick up this month, that's fantastic,

1668
01:06:42,390 --> 01:06:44,615
but there's really only
so high that it can go.

1669
01:06:44,615 --> 01:06:48,416
There are only so many
workers we can bring back in.

1670
01:06:48,416 --> 01:06:51,171
And at some point, we are
gonna have another recession.

1671
01:06:51,171 --> 01:06:54,580
And so I think, you know,
the question is a good one.

1672
01:06:54,580 --> 01:06:58,560
How long can we keep
solid wage gains going?

1673
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:01,870
And if the answer is not that much longer,

1674
01:07:01,870 --> 01:07:04,450
then what does that do
to kind of politics,

1675
01:07:04,450 --> 01:07:06,110
and what does that do
to popular sentiment?

1676
01:07:06,110 --> 01:07:09,430
I think that's an important
question we're facing.

1677
01:07:09,430 --> 01:07:10,600
- Michael, I always enjoy talking to you.

1678
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:11,990
Thank you for taking time for us today.

1679
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:13,480
Michael Strain is a resident scholar

1680
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:15,560
at the American Enterprise Institute.

1681
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:17,930
And once again, it remains
unclear if the 2020 census

1682
01:07:17,930 --> 01:07:19,880
will include a citizenship question.

1683
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:21,890
Just the last hour,
Justice Department lawyers

1684
01:07:21,890 --> 01:07:24,840
told a federal court in
Maryland that they will continue

1685
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:27,480
to look for ways to get
the question on the census

1686
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:30,200
despite an unfavorable ruling
from the Supreme Court.

1687
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:32,570
And the President
reaffirmed his commitment

1688
01:07:32,570 --> 01:07:35,570
to including the question
on the census earlier today

1689
01:07:35,570 --> 01:07:37,963
maybe by using an executive order.

1690
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:41,030
- I just spoke with the Attorney General.

1691
01:07:41,030 --> 01:07:43,210
We have a number of different avenues.

1692
01:07:43,210 --> 01:07:45,690
We can use all of them or one.

1693
01:07:45,690 --> 01:07:48,120
We're doing very well on that issue.

1694
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:53,120
We're spending $15 to
$20 billion on a census.

1695
01:07:53,150 --> 01:07:54,060
We're doing everything.

1696
01:07:54,060 --> 01:07:56,310
We're finding out
everything about everybody.

1697
01:07:56,310 --> 01:07:57,237
Think of it.

1698
01:07:57,237 --> 01:08:01,317
$15 to $20 billion and you're
not allowed to ask 'em,

1699
01:08:01,317 --> 01:08:02,597
"Are you a citizen?"

1700
01:08:03,435 --> 01:08:06,040
And by the way, if you look
at the history of our country,

1701
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,380
it's almost always been asked.

1702
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:11,450
We're fighting very hard against a system

1703
01:08:11,450 --> 01:08:15,500
that's a very difficult system,
but we'll make a decision.

1704
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:16,590
- Joining me now is NBC News

1705
01:08:16,590 --> 01:08:17,870
justice correspondent, Pete Williams.

1706
01:08:17,870 --> 01:08:19,997
Well, that was a moment of
self-awareness for the President

1707
01:08:19,997 --> 01:08:22,530
and he say we're fighting in a system,

1708
01:08:22,530 --> 01:08:23,740
and it's a very difficult system.

1709
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:25,260
It is complex, and it is difficult.

1710
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:27,167
The President can't actually just say,

1711
01:08:27,167 --> 01:08:29,150
"Put the question on now."

1712
01:08:29,150 --> 01:08:31,390
- Well, he can, but whether
that will make a difference

1713
01:08:31,390 --> 01:08:32,280
remains to be seen.

1714
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:34,850
I think at this point, anything
the administration does

1715
01:08:34,850 --> 01:08:37,450
from hereon is going to invite litigation,

1716
01:08:37,450 --> 01:08:39,470
and the Justice Department
admitted as such

1717
01:08:39,470 --> 01:08:42,193
or conceded the point today in its filing.

1718
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:44,360
This is in Maryland.

1719
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:45,470
This is a separate case.

1720
01:08:45,470 --> 01:08:47,750
This is not the one that
went to the Supreme Court.

1721
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:49,510
It's one that is still going on

1722
01:08:49,510 --> 01:08:51,730
and which challengers
say adding this question

1723
01:08:51,730 --> 01:08:54,570
would be unfair
discrimination and violating

1724
01:08:54,570 --> 01:08:57,460
the equal protection
clause of the Constitution.

1725
01:08:57,460 --> 01:09:01,290
And what the government says
in the filing before that judge

1726
01:09:01,290 --> 01:09:03,720
is that they've been asked to reevaluate

1727
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:05,910
all available options that would allow

1728
01:09:05,910 --> 01:09:09,620
for putting this question
back on the census form.

1729
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:10,730
No great surprise there

1730
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:13,100
given what the President
had said this morning.

1731
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:15,390
But they do say that if, for example,

1732
01:09:15,390 --> 01:09:18,820
Commerce Secretary Ross comes
up with a new explanation

1733
01:09:18,820 --> 01:09:21,200
for wanting to put this
question on the form,

1734
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:22,980
then the plaintiffs, the people
who have challenged that,

1735
01:09:22,980 --> 01:09:24,490
would be fully entitled

1736
01:09:24,490 --> 01:09:26,390
to challenge the decision at that time.

1737
01:09:26,390 --> 01:09:29,440
So they can see that almost
anything they do at this point

1738
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:31,680
will be producing a new lawsuit.

1739
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:33,430
And of course, the issue there

1740
01:09:33,430 --> 01:09:36,670
is it puts additional
pressure on the Census Bureau.

1741
01:09:36,670 --> 01:09:39,110
The longer these lawsuits
play out in court,

1742
01:09:39,110 --> 01:09:41,120
the less time the Census Bureau has

1743
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:42,880
to get these forms printed.

1744
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:46,810
And this letter does say despite
all of this back and forth,

1745
01:09:46,810 --> 01:09:49,400
no census forms are being printed now

1746
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:52,393
that have the citizenship
question on them.

1747
01:09:52,393 --> 01:09:54,900
They say they are currently enjoined

1748
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:56,380
by all these court rulings

1749
01:09:56,380 --> 01:09:59,640
from putting the census questionnaire,

1750
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:01,710
printing, rather, the census questionnaire

1751
01:10:01,710 --> 01:10:03,870
that includes the citizenship question.

1752
01:10:03,870 --> 01:10:06,520
So they're still trying
to find some way to do it,

1753
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:08,310
but just about anything they try to do

1754
01:10:08,310 --> 01:10:11,170
is undoubtedly gonna
produce another lawsuit,

1755
01:10:11,170 --> 01:10:12,890
more litigation and more delay.

1756
01:10:12,890 --> 01:10:15,610
- For time and logistics
purposes, under what constraints

1757
01:10:15,610 --> 01:10:17,310
is the Census Bureau operating?

1758
01:10:17,310 --> 01:10:18,143
In other words,

1759
01:10:18,143 --> 01:10:21,030
the President talked
about delaying the census.

1760
01:10:21,030 --> 01:10:22,270
Is that another court case?

1761
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:24,310
Or can the President actually do that?

1762
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:25,550
- Ah, well, two things.

1763
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:27,700
When he talked about delaying the census,

1764
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:31,190
my sense is that he didn't
really mean putting off

1765
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:33,140
when the doors get knocked on

1766
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:35,880
and when people fill out the form.

1767
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:39,630
Traditionally, the census has
been a snapshot of who's where

1768
01:10:39,630 --> 01:10:44,630
on April 1st of every
year that ends in a zero.

1769
01:10:46,370 --> 01:10:49,430
And I can't imagine that
that will be delayed.

1770
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:52,360
What I suspect he was talking about

1771
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:54,230
is getting the forms printed.

1772
01:10:54,230 --> 01:10:56,170
But the government has
said we have to start

1773
01:10:56,170 --> 01:10:59,280
printing these things July
1st, and indeed, they did,

1774
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,588
to get them all done in time.

1775
01:11:01,588 --> 01:11:05,019
It raises the question though,
if they hae to start over,

1776
01:11:05,019 --> 01:11:08,800
if they somehow prevail and
are able to add this question,

1777
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,300
could they trash all the stuff

1778
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:11,860
they printed so far and start over?

1779
01:11:11,860 --> 01:11:13,310
Will they have enough time?

1780
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:15,940
And I guess the answer is if
they had enough money, yes.

1781
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:17,440
They just get more printers involved

1782
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:19,590
and could probably get it done.

1783
01:11:19,590 --> 01:11:21,830
I'm just not sure where
that money comes from,

1784
01:11:21,830 --> 01:11:23,420
whether they would have
to go back to Congress,

1785
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:26,060
and that would add
another bit of delay here.

1786
01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:27,330
- Pete Williams, never been stumped

1787
01:11:27,330 --> 01:11:28,670
by a complicated question.

1788
01:11:28,670 --> 01:11:30,880
We appreciate it, my friend.
- Or pretend not to be.

1789
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:32,350
- NBC News justice correspondent,

1790
01:11:32,350 --> 01:11:33,360
our good friend, Pete Williams.

1791
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:35,920
With me now, Washington Post
opinion writer, Jennifer Rubin.

1792
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:38,330
She's also an MSNBC political contributor,

1793
01:11:38,330 --> 01:11:39,710
and she's a Conservative.

1794
01:11:39,710 --> 01:11:43,640
And she writes in a new
headline, Census: A flat-out win

1795
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:46,930
for progressives, the courts and America.

1796
01:11:46,930 --> 01:11:48,290
Tell me about that, Jennifer.

1797
01:11:48,290 --> 01:11:50,220
Why do you add progressives in that title?

1798
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:52,500
Why do you think it's
a win for progressives?

1799
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,200
- I think it's a win for everyone.

1800
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:57,220
I think the progressive groups
that were litigating this,

1801
01:11:57,220 --> 01:12:01,350
groups like the ACLU, were
making the very cogent argument

1802
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:03,830
that the President was
including this question

1803
01:12:03,830 --> 01:12:07,570
as a way of deterring
people who might be afraid

1804
01:12:07,570 --> 01:12:10,940
to give out their information
or the information

1805
01:12:10,940 --> 01:12:14,490
of people living with them
regarding their immigrant status

1806
01:12:14,490 --> 01:12:17,967
and that this is actually contrary to law.

1807
01:12:17,967 --> 01:12:19,890
It's been decided a while back

1808
01:12:19,890 --> 01:12:22,410
that the census is supposed
to be capturing everybody.

1809
01:12:22,410 --> 01:12:24,950
And by including this question,

1810
01:12:24,950 --> 01:12:27,560
you're purposefully diminishing the count

1811
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:29,850
in areas that there probably are gonna be

1812
01:12:29,850 --> 01:12:34,540
some blue representatives,
urban areas, for example.

1813
01:12:34,540 --> 01:12:37,470
So I think for them,
this was a legal victory

1814
01:12:37,470 --> 01:12:38,730
at the Supreme Court.

1815
01:12:38,730 --> 01:12:41,950
And now, the President is
kind of playing with words,

1816
01:12:41,950 --> 01:12:44,450
and the poor Justice Department
lawyers are having to go

1817
01:12:44,450 --> 01:12:47,529
into court to make themselves
look awfully foolish.

1818
01:12:47,529 --> 01:12:49,230
Understand what they've said.

1819
01:12:49,230 --> 01:12:52,107
They've said, "Well, we
don't have the real reason.

1820
01:12:52,107 --> 01:12:55,447
"We don't have the real
non (mumbles) reason yet,

1821
01:12:55,447 --> 01:12:56,417
"but give us a few weeks

1822
01:12:56,417 --> 01:12:58,350
"and we'll come up with a real reason."

1823
01:12:58,350 --> 01:12:59,790
This is absurd.

1824
01:12:59,790 --> 01:13:02,190
They're obviously just
looking for another lie.

1825
01:13:02,190 --> 01:13:05,400
And to make matters worse,
the Maryland case is the case

1826
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:07,670
in which some new evidence
has come to light,

1827
01:13:07,670 --> 01:13:10,110
and this is damning
for the administration.

1828
01:13:10,110 --> 01:13:13,650
Apparently, a computer file was discovered

1829
01:13:13,650 --> 01:13:16,780
by the daughter of a gentleman
who is designing this

1830
01:13:16,780 --> 01:13:19,240
in order to benefit the Republican party,

1831
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:22,810
by over counting, or if you
will, tipping the scales

1832
01:13:22,810 --> 01:13:24,940
toward the white population.

1833
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:26,530
This is completely illegal.

1834
01:13:26,530 --> 01:13:29,970
This is exactly what the
plaintiffs have been fearing.

1835
01:13:29,970 --> 01:13:32,867
And if they wanna go forward,
the plaintiffs are saying,

1836
01:13:32,867 --> 01:13:34,157
"Well, yes, let's go forward.

1837
01:13:34,157 --> 01:13:37,210
"Let's cover all this new information."

1838
01:13:37,210 --> 01:13:39,887
The government filing
today unbelievably said,

1839
01:13:39,887 --> 01:13:42,317
"Give us some more time
to think of a reason

1840
01:13:42,317 --> 01:13:44,880
"but don't let them look at the
discovery in front of them."

1841
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:47,440
- When you look at the
concept of a census,

1842
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:48,700
it's in the Old Testament, right?

1843
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:49,850
- Right.

1844
01:13:49,850 --> 01:13:51,610
- I mean, it has been
historically understood

1845
01:13:51,610 --> 01:13:54,240
that if you don't count
properly, you mess up

1846
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:57,432
on the provision of
services to your country.

1847
01:13:57,432 --> 01:13:59,630
Should this even be partisan?

1848
01:13:59,630 --> 01:14:01,160
Should this be a progressive win?

1849
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:02,310
Shouldn't we just all agree?

1850
01:14:02,310 --> 01:14:04,200
And you know, sometimes it's
gonna benefit Conservatives,

1851
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:06,560
and sometimes it's gonna
benefit progressives,

1852
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:08,590
but shouldn't we just
all be counting properly

1853
01:14:08,590 --> 01:14:10,280
and not be debating this?

1854
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:11,680
- We should, but unfortunately,

1855
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:12,990
the President has made it partisan.

1856
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:14,960
He is determined not to count everybody

1857
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:17,870
or to set up a question that is designed

1858
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:21,930
to make a count really inaccurate.

1859
01:14:21,930 --> 01:14:24,100
He's the only President
that has done this.

1860
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:26,660
He's the only President who has taken

1861
01:14:26,660 --> 01:14:30,140
objectively neutral
things that shouldn't be

1862
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:32,020
a matter of non-partisanship--

1863
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:33,043
- [Ali] Right, counting how many people

1864
01:14:33,043 --> 01:14:33,876
are in your country--

1865
01:14:33,876 --> 01:14:34,780
- Whether it's the Fourth
of July or accounting.

1866
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:35,613
- Counting how many people we are

1867
01:14:35,613 --> 01:14:37,060
should be objectively neutral.

1868
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:39,400
- It should be, but not
under this president.

1869
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:41,880
And he was the one who
came up with the idea.

1870
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:43,730
The Secretary of Commerce was the one

1871
01:14:43,730 --> 01:14:46,377
who came up with a false reason.

1872
01:14:46,377 --> 01:14:49,710
The Chief Justice was very
nice not calling him a liar,

1873
01:14:49,710 --> 01:14:53,490
but he essentially said the
reason doesn't match the facts.

1874
01:14:53,490 --> 01:14:55,516
That's lying in my book.

1875
01:14:55,516 --> 01:14:58,430
But he sent them back to
figure this whole thing out,

1876
01:14:58,430 --> 01:15:00,320
I think hoping that it wouldn't come back.

1877
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:03,030
I suspect if it ever comes
back to the Supreme Court,

1878
01:15:03,030 --> 01:15:06,100
the Supreme Court will have
used up their patience on this

1879
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:08,890
and will swat it away again.

1880
01:15:08,890 --> 01:15:09,750
- What a remarkable,

1881
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:11,290
I mean, of all the things I didn't think

1882
01:15:11,290 --> 01:15:13,242
I'd actually be disgusting
as a journalist,

1883
01:15:13,242 --> 01:15:16,030
this is just one more
to pile on to the top.

1884
01:15:16,030 --> 01:15:17,160
Jennifer, good to see you as always.

1885
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:18,170
Thank you for joining us.
- You too.

1886
01:15:18,170 --> 01:15:20,460
- MSNBC political contributor, Jen Rubin.

1887
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:21,600
Up next, you hear it a lot

1888
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:24,580
from the 2020 Democratic
presidential candidates.

1889
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:26,570
They want to invest in education.

1890
01:15:26,570 --> 01:15:29,240
Most of them don't have
a very detailed plan

1891
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:30,073
on how they'd do it,

1892
01:15:30,073 --> 01:15:32,740
but Senator Amy Klobuchar
just unveiled hers.

1893
01:15:32,740 --> 01:15:34,690
I'm gonna talk to her about it
in just a couple of minutes.

1894
01:15:34,690 --> 01:15:36,480
And later, the President said he'd start

1895
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:39,250
a big deportation push
after the Fourth of July.

1896
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:40,710
I'll talk to a former ICE chief

1897
01:15:40,710 --> 01:15:44,340
about what goes into nationwide
immigration raids next.

1898

anything remotely like this before?

1981
01:18:53,470 --> 01:18:55,330
- We're prepared to do it in a novel way,

1982
01:18:55,330 --> 01:18:56,620
in an original way.

1983
01:18:56,620 --> 01:18:58,930
And we wanna make sure that
we're writing our own playbook.

1984

- I do not, and I believe

1986

though in a responsible way.

- Where do you see your party right now?

01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:28,260
have returned to serious
policy discussions.

1993
01:19:28,260 --> 01:19:31,110
Today, a number of them are
talking about education.

1994
01:19:31,110 --> 01:19:33,610
10 Democratic contenders are taking part

1995
01:19:33,610 --> 01:19:36,250
in the National Education Association's

1996
01:19:36,250 --> 01:19:38,830
Strong Public Schools Presidential Forum

1997

taking place right now in Houston.

1998
01:19:41,010 --> 01:19:43,950
Bernie Sanders, you can
see up there on the stage.

1999
01:19:43,950 --> 01:19:46,340
One of the candidates
participating in today's event

2000
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:48,510
is Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar

2001
01:19:48,510 --> 01:19:51,820
whose mother was a second grade teacher.

2002
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:54,020
A short time ago, she
unveiled a new proposal

2003
01:19:54,020 --> 01:19:56,200
called progress partnerships,

2004
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:58,070
a federal state effort to provide

2005
01:19:58,070 --> 01:20:01,480
additional resources and
funding for public schools.

2006
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:03,960
In order to take part,
states will need to do

2007
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:06,600
or have already done the following things.

2008
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:07,840
With regard to teacher pay,

2009
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:10,170
states will agree to a
state federal partnership

2010
01:20:10,170 --> 01:20:12,630
that includes generous federal matches

2011
01:20:12,630 --> 01:20:15,070
to increase salaries for all teachers.

2012
01:20:15,070 --> 01:20:16,920
States will also have
to work with educators

2013
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:19,140
to develop and submit recommendations

2014
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:22,330
on how schools can meet the
needs of working families

2015
01:20:22,330 --> 01:20:25,040
like after-school programs,
alternative programs

2016
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:26,380
and community schools.

2017
01:20:26,380 --> 01:20:28,580
The plan also calls for
generous federal funding

2018
01:20:28,580 --> 01:20:30,520
to improve school infrastructure.

2019
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:32,470
States will also have
to create a mechanism

2020
01:20:32,470 --> 01:20:34,730
for distributing those
funds that make sure

2021
01:20:34,730 --> 01:20:38,150
to address disparities in
conditions and resources

2022
01:20:38,150 --> 01:20:41,310
and provide equal funding for
districts across the state.

2023
01:20:41,310 --> 01:20:44,710
And states will also need
to convene a commission

2024
01:20:44,710 --> 01:20:47,700
to review their existing
education funding formula

2025
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:48,970
to ensure that all students,

2026
01:20:48,970 --> 01:20:51,200
particularly those with
the greatest needs,

2027
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:54,120
have access to adequate
educational resources.

2028
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:56,170
Senator Klobuchar joins me now

2029
01:20:56,170 --> 01:20:58,270
from the NEA conference in Houston.

2030
01:20:58,270 --> 01:21:01,630
She is a contender for
the presidency in 2020.

2031
01:21:01,630 --> 01:21:02,760
Senator, good to see you again.

2032
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:04,730
Thank you for being with us.

2033
01:21:04,730 --> 01:21:06,300
- Well, thanks, Ali.

2034
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:07,830
Thanks for mentioning my mom.

2035
01:21:07,830 --> 01:21:09,590
She would have loved to be here today.

2036
01:21:09,590 --> 01:21:13,960
She taught second grade
until she was 70 years old.

2037
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:14,793
- [Ali] Wow.

2038
01:21:14,793 --> 01:21:16,070
- And I still have people come up to me

2039
01:21:16,070 --> 01:21:18,180
and say she was their favorite teacher.

2040
01:21:18,180 --> 01:21:21,160
Her favorite unit she taught
was the monarch butterfly one

2041
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:24,680
where she would dress up as
a butterfly with antennas,

2042
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:28,489
tights, and carry a sign
that said to Mexico or bust.

2043
01:21:28,489 --> 01:21:29,322
- [Ali] That is amazing.

2044
01:21:29,322 --> 01:21:31,730
- [Amy] Because that's where
the monarch butterflies flew.

2045
01:21:31,730 --> 01:21:32,563
- [Ali] We've got a picture of
her on the screen, actually.

2046
01:21:32,563 --> 01:21:33,396
- She was an incredible teacher.

2047
01:21:33,396 --> 01:21:35,830
And there she is, yes.

2048
01:21:35,830 --> 01:21:37,830
And she actually, she was
the teacher of the year

2049
01:21:37,830 --> 01:21:39,870
for her district a number of times.

2050
01:21:39,870 --> 01:21:42,620
And one of the things that she
thought very strongly about

2051
01:21:42,620 --> 01:21:46,000
was that all kids, which
I have now inherited,

2052
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:49,530
all kids deserve a right
to a good education.

2053
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:52,050
And that's why I went to public school.

2054
01:21:52,050 --> 01:21:53,530
My daughter went to public schools,

2055
01:21:53,530 --> 01:21:55,590
including a number of years in a school

2056
01:21:55,590 --> 01:21:58,460
that was nearly 90%
free and reduced lunch.

2057
01:21:58,460 --> 01:22:01,390
So I have a sense of
what's going on there,

2058
01:22:01,390 --> 01:22:03,160
and I can tell you right
now, there should be

2059
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:06,530
more federal investment and
more focus on education.

2060
01:22:06,530 --> 01:22:09,460
If we wanna participate
in this global economy,

2061
01:22:09,460 --> 01:22:12,270
our kids have to be able to do a good job.

2062
01:22:12,270 --> 01:22:14,730
And to do a good job,
you need good teachers.

2063
01:22:14,730 --> 01:22:18,690
And to recruit good teachers,
you need to have good pay,

2064
01:22:18,690 --> 01:22:21,410
and you need to make sure that
the kids are getting prepared

2065
01:22:21,410 --> 01:22:23,070
for the jobs we have available today.

2066
01:22:23,070 --> 01:22:26,500
- So we have 330 million in
the United States, roughly.

2067
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:30,320
We have 50 million public
school students in 2017.

2068
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:32,220
And fundamentally, the responsibility

2069
01:22:32,220 --> 01:22:34,945
for educating those students
falls to the states.

2070
01:22:34,945 --> 01:22:37,330
So while I'm deeply appreciative

2071
01:22:37,330 --> 01:22:39,600
of the thought that goes
into plans like yours

2072
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:42,500
and the other candidates,
states, in general,

2073
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:44,550
have been underfunding, very deliberately

2074
01:22:46,197 --> 01:22:47,340
underfunding public
education for decades now.

2075
01:22:47,340 --> 01:22:50,450
We have created a world in
which people like your mother

2076
01:22:50,450 --> 01:22:52,660
are not treated the way they should be

2077
01:22:52,660 --> 01:22:55,160
in terms of the respect and
the pay they should be given.

2078
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:58,680
Teachers now, public school
teachers who may earn

2079
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:00,430
whatever they earn are often taking money

2080
01:23:00,430 --> 01:23:03,300
out of their own pockets to
buy supplies for their schools.

2081
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:04,210
How do you

2082
01:23:04,210 --> 01:23:05,590
shift that conversation?
- Exactly, my mom did that.

2083
01:23:05,590 --> 01:23:07,100
- Because the federal
government can't take

2084
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:07,933
all that responsibility.
- My mom did that.

2085
01:23:07,933 --> 01:23:10,940
Okay, so the federal
government is spending

2086
01:23:10,940 --> 01:23:14,810
like 3% of education costs,
and you should move that up.

2087
01:23:14,810 --> 01:23:17,000
And let me tell you, exactly what you said

2088
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,920
is why I put these progress
partnerships forward.

2089
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:23,580
I think you need to incentivize
the states to do more,

2090
01:23:23,580 --> 01:23:25,420
especially when it comes to teacher pay

2091
01:23:25,420 --> 01:23:26,660
and infrastructure, those things.

2092
01:23:26,660 --> 01:23:29,450
And you do it with
generous matching grants

2093
01:23:29,450 --> 01:23:31,810
and to make sure they're
headed in the right direction.

2094
01:23:31,810 --> 01:23:33,960
The second thing, and this is a plan

2095
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:36,890
a number of us have put
forward, Kamala Harris, others,

2096
01:23:36,890 --> 01:23:39,030
about increasing teacher pay.

2097
01:23:39,030 --> 01:23:42,020
And one of the ways you can
do this is by paying for it

2098
01:23:42,020 --> 01:23:46,430
with going back to the numbers
on the estate tax that we had

2099
01:23:46,430 --> 01:23:49,890
during the Obama administration
or somewhere around that.

2100
01:23:49,890 --> 01:23:53,840
And that would literally
raise enough money

2101
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:55,950
to substantially increase teacher pay.

2102
01:23:55,950 --> 01:23:59,690
We're talking here about
that estate tax exemption.

2103
01:23:59,690 --> 01:24:01,640
That would be something
that would be really helpful

2104
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:03,950
to recruiting, and that's
federal money, right?

2105
01:24:03,950 --> 01:24:05,368
Then you have ideas like mine
which is to incentivize states

2106
01:24:05,368 --> 01:24:08,351
to be focusing more on
teachers and our schools

2107
01:24:08,351 --> 01:24:13,160
and making sure that we have
more quality in our schools.

2108
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:15,440
That's the way you do it.

2109
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:16,617
- So we have two different
issues that we're dealing with.

2110
01:24:16,617 --> 01:24:17,905
One is teacher pay.

2111
01:24:17,905 --> 01:24:18,933
And I just wanna show our views.

2112
01:24:18,933 --> 01:24:21,720
According to the National
Education Association

2113
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:25,250
hosting the event you're at,
the highest teacher salaries

2114
01:24:25,250 --> 01:24:27,090
are in New York, California
and Massachusetts,

2115
01:24:27,090 --> 01:24:29,330
upward of $80,000 a year.

2116
01:24:29,330 --> 01:24:32,650
The lowest, in Mississippi,
West Virginia and Oklahoma,

2117
01:24:32,650 --> 01:24:35,220
in the 40s.

2118
01:24:35,220 --> 01:24:37,740
So we've got that problem
that you and I discussed,

2119
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:38,837
and then we've got this other issue,

2120
01:24:38,837 --> 01:24:41,040
and that is states with
the highest and lowest

2121
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:42,900
average spending per capital on students.

2122
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:45,540
Again, New York, Washington
state and New Jersey

2123
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:48,610
spent upward of $20,000 per pupil.

2124
01:24:48,610 --> 01:24:49,526
Idaho, Utah and Arizona are spending

2125
01:24:49,526 --> 01:24:54,526
six, seven and $8,000 per pupil.

2126
01:24:54,630 --> 01:24:56,420
We're not even, we're nowhere close

2127
01:24:56,420 --> 01:24:59,710
to having a standardized
level of education

2128
01:24:59,710 --> 01:25:00,793
if you Look at it through
funding in this country.

2129
01:25:00,793 --> 01:25:03,560
- Right, and so that is why,

2130
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:06,000
right, and so that is why
upping the federal role,

2131
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:10,016
putting in an Education
Secretary who is not Betsy DeVos,

2132
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:13,950
making sure that we have
policymakers in place

2133
01:25:13,950 --> 01:25:18,460
that understand what education
means and how important it is

2134
01:25:18,460 --> 01:25:19,520
for individual families

2135
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:21,360
but also for the future of our country

2136
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:24,260
when we're trying to
compete in a global economy.

2137
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:26,800
And then I think one
really interesting issue

2138
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:30,160
was apprenticeships and doing
more with community colleges

2139
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:31,810
at the high school level.

2140
01:25:31,810 --> 01:25:32,720
So that's a lot about

2141
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:35,070
what we are gonna be talking about today.

2142
01:25:35,070 --> 01:25:38,140
And I can tell you, school,
college, those are things

2143
01:25:38,140 --> 01:25:40,860
that people brought to bring
in the parades and things

2144
01:25:40,860 --> 01:25:41,750
that I did the last few days.

2145
01:25:41,750 --> 01:25:44,690
I think I'm the only candidate that went,

2146
01:25:44,690 --> 01:25:46,090
the last three days,

2147
01:25:46,090 --> 01:25:48,990
I've been in Iowa, New
Hampshire and Houston.

2148
01:25:48,990 --> 01:25:50,470
People bring up school a lot.

2149
01:25:50,470 --> 01:25:52,490
That is core to their families.

2150
01:25:52,490 --> 01:25:54,900
And as someone that
didn't come from money,

2151
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:57,300
that stands here today as
a candidate for president

2152
01:25:57,300 --> 01:25:59,630
after being the granddaughter
of an iron ore miner

2153
01:25:59,630 --> 01:26:01,400
who couldn't finish high school

2154
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:04,050
so he could raise his family,
and the daughter of a teacher

2155
01:26:04,050 --> 01:26:07,260
and a newspaper man, I
can speak, walk the walk

2156
01:26:07,260 --> 01:26:08,933
when it comes to the
importance of education,

2157
01:26:08,933 --> 01:26:10,710
and that's what I'm going to be

2158
01:26:10,710 --> 01:26:12,640
talking about today on that stage.

2159
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:13,960
- Senator, one of the other topics

2160
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:16,070
that we cover very closely on this show

2161
01:26:16,070 --> 01:26:19,470
is the issue of data privacy
and management with Facebook.

2162
01:26:19,470 --> 01:26:21,100
Roger McNamee, who's a
great friend of our show,

2163
01:26:21,100 --> 01:26:24,240
talks very fondly of the fact that you,

2164
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:25,480
you don't get a lot of press for this,

2165
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:27,950
but you put a lot of thinking

2166
01:26:27,950 --> 01:26:31,230
into how to deal with
Silicon Valley and tech.

2167
01:26:31,230 --> 01:26:33,180
Give us a bit of your
idea about how you deal

2168
01:26:33,180 --> 01:26:35,410
with the very pressing
and almost daily concerns

2169
01:26:35,410 --> 01:26:38,500
that we're hearing about
how these companies operate

2170
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:40,213
and manage our information.

2171
01:26:42,229 --> 01:26:44,240
- I think they thought they
could just run the tables

2172
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:46,840
and no one would care because
they're successful companies.

2173
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:48,750
I don't like to take
success away from them.

2174
01:26:48,750 --> 01:26:49,640
That's great.

2175
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:52,090
But the point is we need
a counterbalance here.

2176
01:26:52,090 --> 01:26:54,920
And the first thing we need
is privacy rules in place.

2177
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:57,690
And they've been able to say,
"Hey, we're just a forum."

2178
01:26:57,690 --> 01:26:58,523
No, they're not.

2179
01:26:58,523 --> 01:26:59,940
They are media companies.

2180
01:26:59,940 --> 01:27:03,330
They've made tons of money off
of individuals' information.

2181
01:27:03,330 --> 01:27:06,470
So that's why this idea of
putting privacy rules in place

2182
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:09,170
at one of the few bipartisan
bills out there to do it,

2183
01:27:09,170 --> 01:27:11,160
with getting notice of data breaches

2184
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:13,480
and making sure that
there are rules in place

2185
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:16,830
so people can protect their
private data is first.

2186
01:27:16,830 --> 01:27:20,020
You also have to make sure
that when they're sharing data,

2187
01:27:20,020 --> 01:27:21,390
that there's rules about that.

2188
01:27:21,390 --> 01:27:24,640
And I would suggest that
they have to pay a fee, a tax

2189
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:25,850
so that money can go back

2190
01:27:25,850 --> 01:27:28,970
into our nation's
cybersecurity to protect us.

2191
01:27:28,970 --> 01:27:31,586
And the third thing is
all about democracy.

2192
01:27:31,586 --> 01:27:33,720
If we don't do something about this

2193
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:36,350
before the next election,
when we have a president

2194
01:27:36,350 --> 01:27:40,070
sending out doctored
videos of Speaker Pelosi,

2195
01:27:40,070 --> 01:27:42,750
she's strong, she's gonna
be able to protect herself,

2196
01:27:42,750 --> 01:27:44,970
but if this is what our
campaigns are gonna come to,

2197
01:27:44,970 --> 01:27:48,360
videos where you can't even
tell if it's the person or not,

2198
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:49,690
we have a major problem.

2199
01:27:49,690 --> 01:27:52,630
So making those companies
put some rules of the road

2200
01:27:52,630 --> 01:27:55,420
in place when it comes
to who's buying ads,

2201
01:27:55,420 --> 01:27:58,330
who is paying for those
ads, what those ads are

2202
01:27:58,330 --> 01:28:00,730
so other campaigns and
the media can see them

2203
01:28:00,730 --> 01:28:01,940
is gonna be critical.

2204
01:28:01,940 --> 01:28:04,620
Why should your network
have to follow those rules

2205
01:28:04,620 --> 01:28:07,140
and then these other
billion-dollar companies don't?

2206
01:28:07,140 --> 01:28:08,930
It makes no sense at all.

2207
01:28:08,930 --> 01:28:12,330
And as we know from 2016,
it played a major role

2208
01:28:12,330 --> 01:28:17,063
in spreading fake news and
also allowing, basically,

2209
01:28:18,140 --> 01:28:21,320
for foreign countries to have
influence on our election.

2210
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:23,950
And when I heard the President
make a joke about meddling

2211
01:28:23,950 --> 01:28:25,570
when he was at the G20,

2212
01:28:25,570 --> 01:28:27,500
that's just what we're
dealing with right now.

2213
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:28,770
We're in July 4th week.

2214
01:28:28,770 --> 01:28:32,950
We know that millions
of people sacrificed,

2215
01:28:32,950 --> 01:28:34,680
serving our country.

2216
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:37,260
Hundreds and thousands of them are dying

2217
01:28:37,260 --> 01:28:39,220
serving our country.

2218
01:28:39,220 --> 01:28:42,110
That's what's happened, and
yet, he makes a joke about it.

2219
01:28:42,110 --> 01:28:44,600
It's not a joke, not to
those who have served

2220
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:45,660
to protect our freedom.

2221
01:28:45,660 --> 01:28:47,390
- Senator, I wanna ask
you one last question.

2222
01:28:47,390 --> 01:28:48,260
You're from Minnesota,

2223
01:28:48,260 --> 01:28:50,310
and you are on the Agriculture Committee.

2224
01:28:51,590 --> 01:28:53,880
Just in the last hour, I spoke
to a Conservative economist

2225
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:56,080
who said that while farmers are suffering,

2226
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:57,860
particularly for the price
of their corn or soybeans

2227
01:28:57,860 --> 01:29:01,230
because of the trade war,
the amount of subsidy

2228
01:29:01,230 --> 01:29:03,600
they get from the federal
government allows them

2229
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:06,510
to justify continuing
to support the President

2230
01:29:06,510 --> 01:29:07,460
in these trade wars.

2231
01:29:07,460 --> 01:29:08,710
What's your take on that?

2232
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:12,760
- My take is that the farmers I know,

2233
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:14,090
they just wanna make a living.

2234
01:29:14,090 --> 01:29:15,550
And they know very well,

2235
01:29:15,550 --> 01:29:19,390
the more their soybeans sit at their farms

2236
01:29:19,390 --> 01:29:21,911
or they are unable to
sell goods to market,

2237
01:29:21,911 --> 01:29:24,400
the more those contracts
are going to farmers

2238
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:26,440
in other countries and foreign lands,

2239
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:28,300
and it's gonna be harder and harder.

2240
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:30,800
They can't just get those
contracts back in a month

2241
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:32,910
so their long-term viability,

2242
01:29:32,910 --> 01:29:36,380
we have had more and
more farm bankruptcies,

2243
01:29:36,380 --> 01:29:37,820
especially for the small farmers.

2244
01:29:37,820 --> 01:29:40,500
So my focus as a senior member
of the Agriculture Committee

2245
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:43,265
and my focus as president
will be to make sure

2246
01:29:43,265 --> 01:29:45,960
that we keep our food supply in America.

2247
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:49,240
We do that with a special
focus on our small farmers.

2248
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:51,818
I have a very strong track
record of making sure

2249
01:29:51,818 --> 01:29:53,480
these payments aren't going

2250
01:29:53,480 --> 01:29:56,260
to the Beverly Hills 90210 area code,

2251
01:29:56,260 --> 01:29:59,410
that they're going instead
to our small farmers,

2252
01:29:59,410 --> 01:30:03,130
and then making sure that if
we're gonna push on trade,

2253
01:30:03,130 --> 01:30:06,260
which we should do, that
we're not using a meat cleaver

2254
01:30:06,260 --> 01:30:07,490
like this president has done,

2255
01:30:07,490 --> 01:30:09,630
or we can call it a tweet cleaver,

2256
01:30:09,630 --> 01:30:13,210
but instead, we're focused
on targeted tariffs

2257
01:30:13,210 --> 01:30:15,390
and targeted trade policies

2258
01:30:15,390 --> 01:30:16,840
that are really gonna make a difference.

2259
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:18,130
And that's what I'm concerned about

2260
01:30:18,130 --> 01:30:19,520
that's going on in the Midwest.

2261
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:21,990
I'm someone that's won in
those red districts, Ali.

2262
01:30:21,990 --> 01:30:26,570
I have won in 42 of the counties
that Trump won in my state.

2263
01:30:26,570 --> 01:30:28,790
I think that farmers wanna
make a decent living,

2264
01:30:28,790 --> 01:30:30,440
and they want someone that
can look them in the eye

2265
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:31,640
and tell them the truth.

2266
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:34,210
They don't always agree with
it, but tell them the truth.

2267
01:30:34,210 --> 01:30:36,900
That's something that this
president really does.

2268
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:37,900
- Senator Amy Klobuchar,

2269
01:30:37,900 --> 01:30:40,133
thank you for taking
time to talk to us today.

2270
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,440
- It was great to be on.

2271
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:43,660
Thank you.
- Amy Klobuchar,

2272
01:30:43,660 --> 01:30:44,670
candidate for president,

2273
01:30:44,670 --> 01:30:46,810
and she's a senator from Minnesota.

2274
01:30:46,810 --> 01:30:48,620
Still ahead, the President
promised to crack down

2275
01:30:48,620 --> 01:30:51,410
on illegal immigration
after the Fourth of July.

2276
01:30:51,410 --> 01:30:52,530
The holiday's come and gone,

2277
01:30:52,530 --> 01:30:54,450
and Trump says the raids will start soon.

2278
01:30:54,450 --> 01:30:56,483
I'll talk to a former head of ICE next.

2279
01:31:00,485 --> 01:31:02,359
- A major story broke late last night.

2280
01:31:02,359 --> 01:31:03,880
- Well, let's start with
the morning's top stories.

2281
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:05,670
- We begin with new data this morning.

2282
01:31:05,670 --> 01:31:07,050
- [Announcer] Wake up
with the news you need

2283
01:31:07,050 --> 01:31:08,050
to start your day.

2284
01:31:08,050 --> 01:31:10,320
Join Amin Mohadin and Yasmin Vossoughian.

2285
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:11,860
- This is your morning rundown.

2286
01:31:11,860 --> 01:31:12,693
- [Announcer] First Look,

2287
01:31:12,693 --> 01:31:15,113
weekday mornings at five on MSNBC.

2288
01:31:19,830 --> 01:31:20,670
- Budget meeting.

2289
01:31:20,670 --> 01:31:21,560
- Sweet.

2290
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:23,805
- If you compare last
quarter to this quarter--

2291
01:31:23,805 --> 01:31:24,638
- [Group] Mmm.

2292
01:31:24,638 --> 01:31:25,621
- [Announcer] It's no
wonder everything seems

2293
01:31:25,621 --> 01:31:26,830
a little better with the
creamy taste of Philly.

2294
01:31:26,830 --> 01:31:28,810
Made with fresh milk and real cream.

2295
01:31:28,810 --> 01:31:30,230
It must be the Philly.

2296
01:31:30,230 --> 01:31:32,300
- Shaving has been difficult for me.

2297
01:31:32,300 --> 01:31:33,460
I have very sensitive skin.

2298
01:31:33,460 --> 01:31:34,753
I get ingrown hairs.

2299
01:31:38,028 --> 01:31:41,037
It just stopped that irritation,
that burn that I get.

2300
01:31:41,965 --> 01:31:43,523
- I wouldn't use anything else.

2301
01:31:45,330 --> 01:31:48,180
- Going to the Shawn
Mendes Verizon Up concert

2302
01:31:48,180 --> 01:31:49,690
was like an out-of-body experience.

2303
01:31:49,690 --> 01:31:52,350
- [Announcer] Why the Yousafzai
sisters chose Verizon.

2304
01:31:52,350 --> 01:31:53,183
- We were right in front of him.

2305
01:31:53,183 --> 01:31:54,750
- Dead center, front row.

2306
01:31:54,750 --> 01:31:56,192
Actually, Zamila, you
touched Shawn Mendes.

2307
01:31:56,192 --> 01:31:57,025
- She touched Shawn Mendes.
- Yeah, I touched him.

2308
01:31:57,025 --> 01:31:58,770
He like held my hand for a while,

2309
01:31:58,770 --> 01:32:00,660
and then we got to meet
him after, which was like--

2310
01:32:00,660 --> 01:32:01,537
- Another surprise.

2311
01:32:01,537 --> 01:32:02,370
- Yeah.

2312
01:32:02,370 --> 01:32:03,203
We love Verizon even more now.

2313
01:32:03,203 --> 01:32:05,340
I'll never forget that day ever.

2314
01:32:05,340 --> 01:32:06,860
- [Announcer] The network
more people rely on

2315
01:32:06,860 --> 01:32:08,680
gives you more, like thousands of tickets

2316
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:11,060
to concerts, festivals and private shows,

2317
01:32:11,060 --> 01:32:13,690
and big savings on our best
phones when you switch.

2318
01:32:13,690 --> 01:32:15,210
That's Verizon.

2319
01:32:15,210 --> 01:32:17,020
- It's so easy to sell on Poshmark.

2320
01:32:17,020 --> 01:32:19,500
You just pick out your item,
snap a couple of photos,

2321
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:20,820
and boom, it's up for sale.

2322
01:32:20,820 --> 01:32:23,300
When I look at my old clothes
now, I see dollar signs

2323
01:32:23,300 --> 01:32:25,180
just this month, I made a
couple of hundred dollars

2324
01:32:25,180 --> 01:32:27,650
on Poshmark just selling
items out of my closet.

2325
01:32:27,650 --> 01:32:30,457
- [Announcer] Download
the free Poshmark app now.

2326
01:32:30,457 --> 01:32:32,663
- Pain thinks it makes the rules,

2327
01:32:33,563 --> 01:32:35,160
but the rules just changed.

2328
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:37,440
New IcyHot lidocaine dry

2333
01:32:46,340 --> 01:32:48,100
settle for a restless night's sleep.

2334
01:32:48,100 --> 01:32:49,310

2335
01:32:49,310 --> 01:32:52,300
Aleve PM, the only one to
combine a safe sleep aid

2336
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:54,640
and the 12-hour pain-relieving
strength of Aleve

2337
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:57,920

morning so you feel refreshed.

2338
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:00,460
Aleve PM, there's a better choice.

2339
01:33:00,460 --> 01:33:04,470
- Hi, Phil Swift here for the
Flex Seal family of products.

could do with Flex Minis.

2348
01:33:31,292 --> 01:33:34,292

2349
01:33:43,380 --> 01:33:45,230
- I'm Alex Trebek here to tell you

2350
01:33:45,230 --> 01:33:47,380
about the Colonial Penn program.

2351
01:33:47,380 --> 01:33:51,090
If you're aged 50 to 85 and
looking to buy life insurance

2352
01:33:51,090 --> 01:33:54,330
on a fixed budget, remember the three Ps.

2353
01:33:54,330 --> 01:33:55,370
- The three Ps?

2354
01:33:55,370 --> 01:33:57,000
- What are the three Ps?

2355
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,580
- The three Ps of life
insurance on a fixed budget

2356
01:33:59,580 --> 01:34:03,000
are price, price and price,

2357
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:07,070
a price you can afford, a
price that can't increase

2358
01:34:07,070 --> 01:34:08,800
and a price that fits your budget.

2359
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:10,960
- I'm 65 and take medications.

2360
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:12,070
What's my price?

2361
01:34:12,070 --> 01:34:15,270
- You an get coverage for $9.95 a month.

2362
01:34:15,270 --> 01:34:16,790
- I just turned 80.

2363
01:34:16,790 --> 01:34:18,230
What's my price.

2364
01:34:18,230 --> 01:34:20,710
- 9.95 a month for you too.

That's 1-800-480-5533.

2375
01:34:41,950 --> 01:34:42,980
Call now.

2376
01:34:42,980 --> 01:34:44,830
- [Announcer] Stop the killing today.

2377
01:34:47,930 --> 01:34:49,080
- I don't call 'em raids.

2378
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:51,170
I say they came in illegally,

2379
01:34:51,170 --> 01:34:52,830
and we are bringing 'em out legally.

2380
01:34:52,830 --> 01:34:54,800
These are people where we have the papers.

2381
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:56,600
We've gone through the court system.

2382
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:58,470
They'll be starting fairly soon.

2383
01:34:58,470 --> 01:34:59,820
But I don't call 'em raids.

2384
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:01,930
- That was President Trump earlier

2385
01:35:01,930 --> 01:35:04,510
talking about the ICE raids
that he's been promising.

2386
01:35:04,510 --> 01:35:07,507
The President initially
delayed the raids on June 22nd,

2387
01:35:07,507 --> 01:35:09,360
the day before they were set to begin,

2388
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:12,580
saying he'd give Congress two
weeks to work on asylum laws

2389
01:35:12,580 --> 01:35:15,100
and help the flow of migrants
at the southern US border.

2390
01:35:15,100 --> 01:35:15,960
But since then,

2391
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:19,160
no comprehensive immigration
reform deal has been reached.

2392
01:35:19,160 --> 01:35:20,730
With me now is the former Acting Director

2393
01:35:20,730 --> 01:35:23,380
of US Immigrations and Custom
Enforcement, John Sanders.

2394
01:35:23,380 --> 01:35:25,480
John, good to see you again.

2395
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:26,340
This is tricky.

2396
01:35:26,340 --> 01:35:28,330
Whether the President wants
to call them raids or not,

2397
01:35:28,330 --> 01:35:31,970
they are some sort of
enforcement action that require

2398
01:35:31,970 --> 01:35:33,620
some degree of planning,
and there were some people,

2399
01:35:33,620 --> 01:35:34,950
you and I talked about this last time.

2400
01:35:34,950 --> 01:35:36,580
There were some people
who said the President,

2401
01:35:36,580 --> 01:35:38,310
by continuing to announce these things

2402
01:35:38,310 --> 01:35:40,950
and talk about them in the
media, actually compromises

2403
01:35:40,950 --> 01:35:43,710
the work that he might
be trying to achieve.

2404
01:35:43,710 --> 01:35:44,780
- Yeah, that's absolutely right.

2405
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:47,180
Listen, having been involved
in a number of these operations

2406
01:35:47,180 --> 01:35:49,570
and whether you call them raids
or whatever you call them,

2407
01:35:49,570 --> 01:35:52,280
these enforcement actions,
the number one rule

2408
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:54,670
is you don't tip the target in advance

2409
01:35:54,670 --> 01:35:56,610
because then, when you go
to the house or the location

2410
01:35:56,610 --> 01:35:59,150
where you think that target
is, they're simply not there.

2411
01:35:59,150 --> 01:36:00,300
When we began these operations,

2412
01:36:00,300 --> 01:36:01,870
the beginning of the
operation, we'd get something

2413
01:36:01,870 --> 01:36:04,100
like 90% of the people we're going after,

2414
01:36:04,100 --> 01:36:05,360
but over time, they would dissipate

2415
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:07,630
simply because word got
out that we were conducting

2416
01:36:07,630 --> 01:36:10,083
this type of operation,
and people fled and hid.

2417
01:36:11,390 --> 01:36:15,020
- President Trump has said that
public safety is the reason

2418
01:36:15,020 --> 01:36:17,740
for these raids, or he's
not now calling them raids.

2419
01:36:17,740 --> 01:36:20,250
But new documents actually
show that ICE is building

2420
01:36:20,250 --> 01:36:24,388
target lists for these
mass roundups of people

2421
01:36:24,388 --> 01:36:27,966
based on target numbers
that they have to meet.

2422
01:36:27,966 --> 01:36:31,400
So the question is do these
public documents, you know,

2423
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:33,610
these things sort of hurt the argument

2424
01:36:33,610 --> 01:36:36,423
that there's a public
safety need for these raids?

2425
01:36:36,423 --> 01:36:37,520
- Ali, it's not gonna be public safety.

2426
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:39,627
Listen, ICE, you know,
the problem here is this.

2427
01:36:39,627 --> 01:36:41,420
The President wants big numbers.

2428
01:36:41,420 --> 01:36:42,253
- [Ali] Yeah.

2429
01:36:42,253 --> 01:36:43,670
- To get big numbers, what
that requires, typically,

2430
01:36:43,670 --> 01:36:45,520
is you go after the most
vulnerable population.

2431
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:46,353
They're the easiest to find.

2432
01:36:46,353 --> 01:36:47,790
They're the easiest to get.

2433
01:36:47,790 --> 01:36:49,670
The criminal alien population

2434
01:36:49,670 --> 01:36:51,120
is actually the most difficult to find.

2435
01:36:51,120 --> 01:36:52,320
They're adept at hiding.

2436
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:53,670
They're adept at using aliases.

2437
01:36:53,670 --> 01:36:56,220
It takes a lot more than leg
work to get those individuals

2438
01:36:56,220 --> 01:36:57,920
than it does a family member with children

2439
01:36:57,920 --> 01:36:59,940
who are sitting in a static location.

2440
01:36:59,940 --> 01:37:02,280
So look, I don't think
this operation, at all,

2441
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:04,330
is gonna promote public safety.

2442
01:37:04,330 --> 01:37:06,060
You could argue that ut
helps promote the integrity

2443
01:37:06,060 --> 01:37:08,360
of our immigration court
system or the board of security

2444
01:37:08,360 --> 01:37:09,872
but certainly not public safety.

2445
01:37:09,872 --> 01:37:12,350
- This other story is
the Trump administration

2446
01:37:12,350 --> 01:37:14,551
is threatening to impose huge fines

2447
01:37:14,551 --> 01:37:18,200
on people who disobey deportation orders,

2448
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:20,210
some of them upwards of $300,000.

2449
01:37:20,210 --> 01:37:22,430
Talk to me about that.

2450
01:37:22,430 --> 01:37:24,510
- Well, I mean, there are
certain situations of the law

2451
01:37:24,510 --> 01:37:26,450
in which you can impose
a fine on an individual.

2452
01:37:26,450 --> 01:37:29,048
I tell you, collecting it is
a different story entirely.

2453
01:37:29,048 --> 01:37:31,530
You know, I'm not sure exactly
how they intend to collect it

2454
01:37:31,530 --> 01:37:33,070
against the majority of these individuals.

2455
01:37:33,070 --> 01:37:35,152
It's a bigger problem if some individual

2456
01:37:35,152 --> 01:37:37,440
later is able to legally
enter the United States,

2457
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:39,820
but the reality, Ali, is
that the overwhelming,

2458
01:37:39,820 --> 01:37:40,827
the vast, vast majority of people

2459
01:37:40,827 --> 01:37:43,100
who are deported from this
country are never able

2460
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:45,180
to legally return to the
United States, period.

2461
01:37:45,180 --> 01:37:48,160
- There is wide agreement on
certain immigration issues

2462
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:50,250
in this country, for
instance, on the Dreamers,

2463
01:37:50,250 --> 01:37:53,050
the DACA kids, overwhelming
support for having them

2464
01:37:53,050 --> 01:37:54,576
stay here because they
have to follow rules,

2465
01:37:54,576 --> 01:37:57,130
they've grown up here,
they are either getting

2466
01:37:57,130 --> 01:38:00,740
an education or working, they
can't commit serious crimes.

2467
01:38:00,740 --> 01:38:03,600
But there are other disagreements
about other basic things,

2468
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:05,830
and some Democratic
candidates have actually

2469
01:38:05,830 --> 01:38:07,410
talked about decriminalizing

2470
01:38:07,410 --> 01:38:10,000
the act of illegally
entering the United States.

2471
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,329
Joe Biden has said today
that illegal border crossings

2472
01:38:12,329 --> 01:38:14,796
should not be decriminalized.

2473
01:38:14,796 --> 01:38:16,880
This is a very interesting place

2474
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:19,300
that Democrats are in
because a lot of Americans

2475
01:38:19,300 --> 01:38:22,670
who are sympathetic to
immigrants and asylum seekers

2476
01:38:22,670 --> 01:38:25,130
may not believe that decriminalizing

2477
01:38:25,130 --> 01:38:27,780
the act of coming into the
United States illegally

2478
01:38:27,780 --> 01:38:29,593
should be part of the equation.

2479
01:38:30,760 --> 01:38:32,460
- Yeah, I agree with the
Vice President on this one.

2480
01:38:32,460 --> 01:38:34,680
Listen, if you come across
the border without inspecting,

2481
01:38:34,680 --> 01:38:36,190
that is a crime.

2482
01:38:36,190 --> 01:38:38,430
It's a misdemeanor offense
for your first offense,

2483
01:38:38,430 --> 01:38:39,620
so it's not that serious a crime,

2484
01:38:39,620 --> 01:38:41,490
but it should remain a crime.

2485
01:38:41,490 --> 01:38:42,323
Look, there is a role

2486
01:38:42,323 --> 01:38:44,150
for border security, border enforcement.

2487
01:38:44,150 --> 01:38:46,190
There's a role for immigration
enforcement in this country.

2488
01:38:46,190 --> 01:38:47,780
I take a lot of issue
with the manner in which

2489
01:38:47,780 --> 01:38:49,320
this administration is conducting that.

2490
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:51,360
I think it's detrimental to public safety.

2491
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:52,870
I think they're spreading
out their targets.

2492
01:38:52,870 --> 01:38:55,410
They're focused on vulnerable populations

2493
01:38:55,410 --> 01:38:57,550
instead of folks who pose
a public safety threat,

2494
01:38:57,550 --> 01:39:00,300
but I also worry that because
of the President's policies

2495
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:01,990
that we're now looking at
immigration enforcement

2496
01:39:01,990 --> 01:39:05,500
writ large, and ICE and CBP in
particular, as rogue agencies

2497
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:07,480
rather than questioning
the specific tactics

2498
01:39:07,480 --> 01:39:10,350
this administration is doing
when there is an important role

2499
01:39:10,350 --> 01:39:11,940
for all of our public safety

2500
01:39:11,940 --> 01:39:14,300
in the functions that
ICE and CBD do everyday.

2501
01:39:14,300 --> 01:39:17,236
- John, does what the President,

2502
01:39:17,236 --> 01:39:19,550
is what the President is
doing, is that playing

2503
01:39:19,550 --> 01:39:21,280
into the hands of the President himself

2504
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:24,580
because he provokes a reaction
that causes some Democrats

2505
01:39:24,580 --> 01:39:26,700
to say let's decriminalize the operation,

2506
01:39:26,700 --> 01:39:28,560
and then the President can go out and say

2507
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:30,880
that sounds like open
borders, which he's been

2508
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:34,570
accusing Democrats of
embracing the whole time?

2509
01:39:34,570 --> 01:39:35,770
- I think that's right, Ali.

2510
01:39:35,770 --> 01:39:37,040
I think that, you know, look.

2511
01:39:37,040 --> 01:39:39,150
A lot of the President's chatter

2512
01:39:39,150 --> 01:39:40,810
really is idle threat, so to speak.

2513
01:39:40,810 --> 01:39:41,850
For example, on this raid,

2514
01:39:41,850 --> 01:39:44,100
he's talking about a
million people apprehended.

2515
01:39:44,100 --> 01:39:45,670
ICE has no capacity to arrest

2516
01:39:45,670 --> 01:39:46,730
anywhere near a million people.

2517
01:39:46,730 --> 01:39:48,810
At most, an operation like
this in a two-week period

2518
01:39:48,810 --> 01:39:52,080
is gonna get 5,000, and
that's probably optimistic.

2519
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:53,910
But it does trigger this
kind of reaction of this

2520
01:39:53,910 --> 01:39:56,563
abolish ICE and this other
kind of things where people,

2521
01:39:56,563 --> 01:39:59,140
I think the majority of
the public recognizes

2522
01:39:59,140 --> 01:40:01,150
that ICE plays a critical
role in our public safety,

2523
01:40:01,150 --> 01:40:03,260
and I do think a lot
of people, not enough,

2524
01:40:03,260 --> 01:40:05,240
recognize too that ICE
is probably, you know,

2525
01:40:05,240 --> 01:40:07,560
is a critical player in the
counter-terrorism effort.

2526
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:09,300
They save more children from exploitation

2527
01:40:09,300 --> 01:40:10,810
than any other federal agency.

2528
01:40:10,810 --> 01:40:12,452
They're the leading agency
when it comes to stopping,

2529
01:40:12,452 --> 01:40:15,290
you know, export control,
stopping North Korea and Iran

2530
01:40:15,290 --> 01:40:17,010
from getting sensitive technologies.

2531
01:40:17,010 --> 01:40:18,850
But you're right, it plays into the hands

2532
01:40:18,850 --> 01:40:20,610
when you start taking this
kind of, I hate to say it,

2533
01:40:20,610 --> 01:40:22,558
but extremist positions that
we need to abolish ICE entirely

2534
01:40:22,558 --> 01:40:24,400
or get rid of the border patrol

2535
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:27,220
simply because of the
administration's policies,

2536
01:40:27,220 --> 01:40:29,000
not necessarily the agencies themselves.

2537
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:30,380
- John, always a pleasure to talk to you.

2538
01:40:30,380 --> 01:40:32,930
John Sandweg, former
Acting Director of ICE.

2539
01:40:32,930 --> 01:40:34,090
Coming up next, we're gonna take a look

2540
01:40:34,090 --> 01:40:35,610
at America's energy revolution.

2541
01:40:35,610 --> 01:40:37,900
For the first time, the
United States is producing

2542
01:40:37,900 --> 01:40:41,020
more energy from renewables
than it is from coal.

2543
01:40:41,020 --> 01:40:41,995
I'm gonna talk to an author whose new book

2544
01:40:41,995 --> 01:40:44,930
profiles the man who
built one of the largest

2545
01:40:44,930 --> 01:40:47,270
wind energy empires in the country.

2546
01:40:47,270 --> 01:40:48,653
You are watching MSNBC.

2547
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,420
- My team spent a lot of
time and money posting jobs.

2548
01:40:56,420 --> 01:40:58,180
We would get a flood of resumes,

2549
01:40:58,180 --> 01:41:01,170
but finding the right person
was nearly impossible.

2550
01:41:01,170 --> 01:41:03,870
My budget has to stretch,
but my time can't.

2551
01:41:03,870 --> 01:41:05,800
I was tired of using 12 vendors.

2552
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:08,220
Then I learned that
CareerBuilder has everything,

2553
01:41:08,220 --> 01:41:11,580
data to help us plan, a single
source to find candidates,

2554
01:41:11,580 --> 01:41:13,380
marketing tools to engage them,

2555
01:41:13,380 --> 01:41:15,890
and the fastest background
screening on the market.

2556
01:41:15,890 --> 01:41:17,100
So we made the switch.

2557
01:41:17,100 --> 01:41:19,170
Now, we get the right person faster.

2558
01:41:19,170 --> 01:41:20,890
It's not just efficient.

2559
01:41:20,890 --> 01:41:21,950

- If you use Trivago, Trivago
will compare hotel prices

2640
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:14,400
from hundreds of websites
worldwide so you can often find

2641
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:17,620
a better deal for your hotel
room and also free Wi-Fi.

2642
01:44:17,620 --> 01:44:19,570
Maybe you should try Trivago next time.

2643
01:44:21,750 --> 01:44:22,620
- [Announcer] Hotel?

2644
01:44:22,620 --> 01:44:23,453
Trivago.

2645
01:44:26,333 --> 01:44:27,320
- All right, we're taking a closer look

2646
01:44:27,320 --> 01:44:29,060
into a big economic opportunity

2647
01:44:29,060 --> 01:44:31,310
in the fight against climate
change, clean energy.

2648
01:44:31,310 --> 01:44:33,150
Here's something you may have missed.

2649
01:44:33,150 --> 01:44:36,400
For the first time, our capacity
for creating electricity

2650
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:40,120
from renewable energy sources
surpassed that for coal.

2651
01:44:40,120 --> 01:44:43,180
And as the LA Times points
out, domestic coal production

2652
01:44:43,180 --> 01:44:47,220
and use have dropped to their
lowest levels in four decades

2653
01:44:47,220 --> 01:44:49,610
even though the economy is more than twice

2654
01:44:49,610 --> 01:44:51,880
the size it was 40 years ago.

2655
01:44:51,880 --> 01:44:54,990
Additionally, more coal-fired
power plants have shut down

2656
01:44:54,990 --> 01:44:56,900
so far during the Trump presidency

2657
01:44:56,900 --> 01:45:00,570
than through all eight years
of the Obama administration.

2658
01:45:00,570 --> 01:45:02,802
And it may have something
to do with the cost.

2659
01:45:02,802 --> 01:45:06,110
Let me show you a map of the
least expensive technologies

2660
01:45:06,110 --> 01:45:07,720
for generating electricity

2661
01:45:07,720 --> 01:45:09,870
across the United States by county.

2662
01:45:09,870 --> 01:45:11,290
Here, you can see how,

2663
01:45:11,290 --> 01:45:12,740
let me just show you the colors here.

2664
01:45:12,740 --> 01:45:14,570
The blue is wind.

2665
01:45:14,570 --> 01:45:15,983
Green is natural gas.

2666
01:45:17,140 --> 01:45:19,160
The gold is solar.

2667
01:45:19,160 --> 01:45:20,870
The yellow is also solar.

2668
01:45:20,870 --> 01:45:24,060
One of them is for utilities
that generate electricity.

2669
01:45:24,060 --> 01:45:26,300
The lighter yellow is for residential use.

2670
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:27,970
And the gray, of course, is coal.

2671
01:45:27,970 --> 01:45:28,950
Take a look at that.

2672
01:45:28,950 --> 01:45:31,410
Coal represents the smallest proportion.

2673
01:45:31,410 --> 01:45:33,000
Joining me now is Russell Gold.

2674
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,500
He's a senior energy reporter
for the Wall Street Journal

2675
01:45:35,500 --> 01:45:37,010
and author of a new book,

2676
01:45:37,010 --> 01:45:41,430
Superpower: One Man's Quest
to Transform American Energy.

2677
01:45:41,430 --> 01:45:44,330
It's a book that profiles
a man named Michael Skelly

2678
01:45:44,330 --> 01:45:47,790
who began developing wind
energy infrastructure

2679
01:45:47,790 --> 01:45:50,310
in the early 2000s and went on to build

2680
01:45:50,310 --> 01:45:53,700
the second largest wind power
company in the United States.

2681
01:45:53,700 --> 01:45:54,640
Russell, good to see you again.

2682
01:45:54,640 --> 01:45:55,730
Thank you for joining us.

2683
01:45:55,730 --> 01:45:56,790
- Thanks for having me.

2684
01:45:56,790 --> 01:45:58,890
- I wanna just read from your book.

2685
01:45:58,890 --> 01:46:00,700
You were talking about
Michael Skelly, and you said

2686
01:46:00,700 --> 01:46:03,200
he was a departure from
an earlier generation

2687
01:46:03,200 --> 01:46:06,259
of wind farm builders and
solar panel enthusiasts

2688
01:46:06,259 --> 01:46:10,250
who were more interested in
creating sustainable energy

2689
01:46:10,250 --> 01:46:11,750
than sustainable businesses.

2690
01:46:11,750 --> 01:46:14,410
Kelly wanted to make a profit
because profits would attract

2691
01:46:14,410 --> 01:46:17,660
new investors and money
into renewable energy.

2692
01:46:17,660 --> 01:46:19,810
This has long been the holy grail.

2693
01:46:19,810 --> 01:46:23,615
If you can make sustainable
and renewable profitable,

2694
01:46:23,615 --> 01:46:27,920
it can replace sort of older
fashioned, dirtier energy.

2695
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:29,700
- Right, and we're seeing
that happen right now.

2696
01:46:29,700 --> 01:46:30,890
I mean, with the map you just brought up,

2697
01:46:30,890 --> 01:46:33,160
there is a big part of
the middle of the country

2698
01:46:33,160 --> 01:46:36,680
where you can generate
wind at a really low cost.

2699
01:46:36,680 --> 01:46:37,700
The question right now

2700
01:46:37,700 --> 01:46:40,660
is how fast can that transition happen.

2701
01:46:40,660 --> 01:46:41,880
How fast can you bring in

2702
01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:43,798
more renewables at this lower price?

2703
01:46:43,798 --> 01:46:47,630
- And what are the headwinds
and what are the tailwinds

2704
01:46:47,630 --> 01:46:49,390
for people who are trying to bring

2705
01:46:49,390 --> 01:46:52,030
renewable energy to market faster?

2706
01:46:52,030 --> 01:46:53,500
- Well, tailwinds right now,

2707
01:46:53,500 --> 01:46:55,210
as we've been talking about, are costs.

2708
01:46:55,210 --> 01:46:57,950
Renewable energy, wind,
and increasingly, solar

2709
01:46:57,950 --> 01:47:00,670
is the low-cost way to
generate electricity.

2710
01:47:00,670 --> 01:47:01,720
It beats coal.

2711
01:47:01,720 --> 01:47:05,150
Increasingly, it beats natural
gas, and it beats nuclear.

2712
01:47:05,150 --> 01:47:08,790
The headwinds are, right
now, where you can generate

2713
01:47:08,790 --> 01:47:11,580
renewable energy inexpensively,

2714
01:47:11,580 --> 01:47:12,990
is the middle of the country,

2715
01:47:12,990 --> 01:47:16,110
and that's not exactly
where the factories are,

2716
01:47:16,110 --> 01:47:16,980
the people are.

2717
01:47:16,980 --> 01:47:19,360
So the question is how do
you get that electricity

2718
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:21,670
from the middle of the
country to the coast,

2719
01:47:21,670 --> 01:47:24,850
and that's one of the challenges
that Michael Skelli tackled

2720
01:47:24,850 --> 01:47:26,670
and I wrote about in my
new book, Superpower.

2721
01:47:26,670 --> 01:47:28,910
There are other headwinds
right now, and I would say

2722
01:47:28,910 --> 01:47:31,619
one of the major headwinds
are some of the political

2723
01:47:31,619 --> 01:47:35,370
and incumbents, electric
utilities and electric generators,

2724
01:47:35,370 --> 01:47:38,080
who don't want this change,
because quite frankly,

2725
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:40,996
they're very good at
generating electricity

2726
01:47:40,996 --> 01:47:43,940
from coal and from some
of the older resources,

2727
01:47:43,940 --> 01:47:45,960
and they don't wanna make this change

2728
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:47,850
because that would mean
less opportunity for them.

2729
01:47:47,850 --> 01:47:50,800
Most people switch on a light
and hope that it goes on.

2730
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:52,640
They don't think much about the backbone

2731
01:47:52,640 --> 01:47:55,560
and the infrastructure of
where their power comes from.

2732
01:47:55,560 --> 01:47:56,746
What is required?

2733
01:47:56,746 --> 01:47:58,770
What are the infrastructure requirements

2734
01:47:58,770 --> 01:47:59,880
to make a wholesale shift

2735
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:02,740
or as much of a shift as we
can make into renewables?

2736
01:48:02,740 --> 01:48:04,940
- Well, firs of all, yeah,
it's a great question.

2737
01:48:04,940 --> 01:48:06,610
And first of all, I'm not talking about

2738
01:48:06,610 --> 01:48:10,150
100% renewable electricity
because once you get

2739
01:48:10,150 --> 01:48:13,000
above about 80%, it gets really expensive.

2740
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:16,030
But we can get up to 70,
80% of our electricity

2741
01:48:16,030 --> 01:48:19,160
coming from renewable
resources at the same prices

2742
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:21,793
or perhaps even lower
than we are right now.

2743
01:48:22,924 --> 01:48:25,300
What's required, the big
piece of infrastructure

2744
01:48:25,300 --> 01:48:27,130
that's required is transmission.

2745
01:48:27,130 --> 01:48:29,310
These are big electricity lines

2746
01:48:29,310 --> 01:48:31,754
that can move gigawatts
of electricity around.

2747
01:48:31,754 --> 01:48:34,070
Think about it like your
interstate highways.

2748
01:48:34,070 --> 01:48:36,520
What we have right now are
a lot of two-lane roads

2749
01:48:36,520 --> 01:48:37,860
going all over the place.

2750
01:48:37,860 --> 01:48:39,847
And much like the 1950s, we said,

2751
01:48:39,847 --> 01:48:41,687
"Hey, let's build these
interstate highways

2752
01:48:41,687 --> 01:48:43,637
"so we can move people
quickly and efficiently

2753
01:48:43,637 --> 01:48:45,170
"from one city to another."

2754
01:48:45,170 --> 01:48:46,990
That's really what we need to do right now

2755
01:48:46,990 --> 01:48:48,020
with our transmission.

2756
01:48:48,020 --> 01:48:49,170
- Russell, I appreciate the book,

2757

2760
01:48:56,670 --> 01:49:00,040
Still ahead, a judge gave
leniency to a teenage rape suspect

2761
01:49:00,040 --> 01:49:03,410
because the judge said the
teen came from a good family.

2762
01:49:03,410 --> 01:49:05,240
Coming up next, I'm gonna
talk about how this case

2763
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:07,620
fits into broader
conversations about teens

latest from Bell & Howell.

2777
01:49:31,090 --> 01:49:32,570
We call it Tac Visor.

Tac Visor can do things no
ordinary visor can do things

no ordinary visor can do

like block blinding glare
without blocking your view

2781

so invisible dangers
suddenly become visible,

2782
01:49:41,390 --> 01:49:43,500
and enhance colors to give you vision

2783
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:45,240

01:49:50,917 --> 01:49:52,010
- Just a blank screen.

2789
01:49:52,010 --> 01:49:54,293
- Put down that Tac Visor
and take a look again.

These steps are covered

2857
01:52:46,370 --> 01:52:47,950
- He came from a good family.

2858
01:52:47,950 --> 01:52:50,410
A judge used that excuse to show leniency

2859
01:52:50,410 --> 01:52:53,380
to a suspect accused of sexual
assault and is prompting

2860
01:52:53,380 --> 01:52:56,350
renewed debate about rape
culture in the United States.

2861
01:52:56,350 --> 01:52:58,310
The case comes from New
Jersey, where that judge

2862
01:52:58,310 --> 01:53:02,080
denied a request to try a
16-year-old teen as an adult.

2863
01:53:02,080 --> 01:53:05,370
The suspect is accused of
raping an intoxicated girl,

2864
01:53:05,370 --> 01:53:08,050
recording the assault and
sending the video to friends

2865
01:53:08,050 --> 01:53:12,415
with the text "when your first
time having sex was rape."

2866
01:53:12,415 --> 01:53:14,980
In New York and New Jersey,
prosecutors can request

2867
01:53:14,980 --> 01:53:18,490
to send a juvenile case to
adult court for serious crimes

2868
01:53:18,490 --> 01:53:20,940
if the accused is 15 years old or older,

2869
01:53:20,940 --> 01:53:24,060
but the family court judge
denied prosecutor's motion,

2870
01:53:24,060 --> 01:53:26,387
saying the assault
wasn't rape and writing,

2871
01:53:26,387 --> 01:53:28,607
"This young man comes from a good family

2872
01:53:28,607 --> 01:53:30,737
"who put him into an excellent school

2873
01:53:30,737 --> 01:53:33,020
"where he was doing extremely well."

2874
01:53:33,020 --> 01:53:35,347
He also added, "He is clearly a candidate

2875
01:53:35,347 --> 01:53:38,297
"for not just college but
probably for a good college.

2876
01:53:38,297 --> 01:53:41,640
"His scores for college
entry were very high."

2877
01:53:41,640 --> 01:53:42,510
The state appeals court

2878
01:53:42,510 --> 01:53:44,470
has already overturned
the judge's decision,

2879
01:53:44,470 --> 01:53:46,810
but the case underscores
a fundamental issue

2880
01:53:46,810 --> 01:53:50,670
in the way this country views
rape and sexual assault.

2881
01:53:50,670 --> 01:53:52,970
To talk about those issues,
I turn to Tarana Burke.

2882
01:53:52,970 --> 01:53:55,230
She is the founder of the Me Too movement.

2883
01:53:55,230 --> 01:53:57,240
And you have, during the
time, this has become

2884
01:53:57,240 --> 01:54:00,570
such a big and public movement,
really approached this

2885
01:54:00,570 --> 01:54:04,040
with a degree of sophistication
that says we are working

2886
01:54:04,040 --> 01:54:07,400
from a low base of understanding
about these things.

2887
01:54:07,400 --> 01:54:09,800
And what is the best way
to get us to understand

2888
01:54:09,800 --> 01:54:12,020
what sexual violence is all about?

2889
01:54:12,020 --> 01:54:13,750
- Well, this is why the
conversation has to shift

2890
01:54:13,750 --> 01:54:17,640
about what Me Too is because
the thing that's glaring to me

2891
01:54:17,640 --> 01:54:19,940
in this whole case is that
there's no conversation

2892
01:54:19,940 --> 01:54:21,900
about the survivor,
there's no conversation

2893
01:54:21,900 --> 01:54:23,860
about her grades, how
her life was changed,

2894
01:54:23,860 --> 01:54:25,530
what happened to her, how it affected her,

2895
01:54:25,530 --> 01:54:28,520
and it's focused totally
on this perpetrator.

2896
01:54:28,520 --> 01:54:30,540
And that's what happens
a lot because people,

2897
01:54:30,540 --> 01:54:32,900
what I've realized more
so in the last two years

2898
01:54:32,900 --> 01:54:35,400
is people don't understand
the lifecycle of a survivor.

2899
01:54:35,400 --> 01:54:37,080
They don't understand
what sexual violence is

2900
01:54:37,080 --> 01:54:40,880
or what it does to the
people who experience it.

2901
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:42,990
And so you have cases like this happen

2902
01:54:42,990 --> 01:54:46,690
where you have larger
narratives that are patriarchal

2903
01:54:46,690 --> 01:54:50,340
and misogynistic and veer
towards what men and boys need

2904
01:54:50,340 --> 01:54:52,990
and what their lives and
livelihoods, how that's affected

2905
01:54:52,990 --> 01:54:54,601
more so than the people
who they victimized.

2906
01:54:54,601 --> 01:54:56,570
- There was the same conversation
on college campuses--

2907
01:54:56,570 --> 01:54:57,403
- Absolutely.
- Where we talked about

2908
01:54:57,403 --> 01:55:00,820
whether boys were being,
having their futures ruined

2909
01:55:00,820 --> 01:55:04,036
because of the way their
assaults were being treated.

2910
01:55:04,036 --> 01:55:07,210
What does success look like
for you on these fronts?

2911
01:55:07,210 --> 01:55:09,070
Because I don't think your view

2912
01:55:09,070 --> 01:55:11,680
is that everybody who's a perpetrator

2913
01:55:11,680 --> 01:55:13,965
needs to have all of the
books thrown at them--

2914
01:55:13,965 --> 01:55:14,798
- No.

2915
01:55:14,798 --> 01:55:15,980
- But we're not listening
to the other side.

2916
01:55:15,980 --> 01:55:18,635
We're not balancing out victim's rights

2917
01:55:18,635 --> 01:55:20,120
with perpetrator's rights.
- This is the thing.

2918
01:55:20,120 --> 01:55:22,880
When Me Too went viral,
you had millions of people

2919
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:24,057
literally come together and say,

2920
01:55:24,057 --> 01:55:26,710
"My life has been affected by this thing."

2921
01:55:26,710 --> 01:55:28,590
We've yet to talk about that thing.

2922
01:55:28,590 --> 01:55:30,080
We've yet to unpack
what sexual violence is

2923
01:55:30,080 --> 01:55:32,600
and what it really looks
like in this country.

2924
01:55:32,600 --> 01:55:34,460
It's not about these high profile cases

2925
01:55:34,460 --> 01:55:36,820
as much as it is about
these kinds of cases.

2926
01:55:36,820 --> 01:55:39,020
And so what it's gonna take
is a shift in the narrative

2927
01:55:39,020 --> 01:55:40,870
about how we talk about sexual violence

2928
01:55:40,870 --> 01:55:42,970
and then also how we
talk about this movement.

2929
01:55:42,970 --> 01:55:45,510
This is a movement that's
about healing and action.

2930
01:55:45,510 --> 01:55:47,840
And the healing and
action part, a lot of that

2931
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:51,360
is based on how we educate
people around sexual violence,

2932
01:55:51,360 --> 01:55:54,520
how we educate people around
what survival looks like.

2933
01:55:54,520 --> 01:55:56,840
When we shift the narrative, we have,

2934
01:55:56,840 --> 01:55:58,650
when people are more educated about this,

2935
01:55:58,650 --> 01:55:59,970
these are people who vote,

2936
01:55:59,970 --> 01:56:02,610
people who make the legislative decisions,

2937
01:56:02,610 --> 01:56:04,330
they have to understand this differently.

2938
01:56:04,330 --> 01:56:06,770
It can't come from this
sort of pop culture,

2939
01:56:06,770 --> 01:56:08,455
salacious headline place.

2940
01:56:08,455 --> 01:56:10,310
It has to come to a place
where you really have

2941
01:56:10,310 --> 01:56:12,270
empathy and understanding
for what survival looks like.

2942
01:56:12,270 --> 01:56:13,103
- How do we get there?

2943
01:56:13,103 --> 01:56:14,423
Because you and I have
talked about this before.

2944
01:56:14,423 --> 01:56:17,760
When the people accused of
sexual harassment or assault

2945
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:20,470
are not media or not politicians

2946
01:56:20,470 --> 01:56:25,470
or not CEOs of major companies,
has this trickled down

2947
01:56:25,690 --> 01:56:29,160
to help victims of sexual
violence who don't have a name,

2948
01:56:29,160 --> 01:56:31,380
who are homeless, who are immigrants,

2949
01:56:31,380 --> 01:56:32,820
who are single mothers,

2950
01:56:32,820 --> 01:56:34,970
who work on a factory floor?
- That's our work.

2951
01:56:34,970 --> 01:56:35,803
That's our work.

2952
01:56:35,803 --> 01:56:37,360
That's what the Me Too movement is about.

2953
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:38,450
We have an organization,

2954
01:56:38,450 --> 01:56:40,490
and we are part of a
large spectrum of people

2955
01:56:40,490 --> 01:56:42,090
who are doing this work on the ground.

2956
01:56:42,090 --> 01:56:44,500
I'm appreciative of coming
into spaces like this

2957
01:56:44,500 --> 01:56:46,870
and being able to talk
about it on a national front

2958
01:56:46,870 --> 01:56:48,120
because this is how we change it.

2959
01:56:48,120 --> 01:56:50,630
People need to understand
that this work is happening.

2960
01:56:50,630 --> 01:56:52,320
It was happening before Me Too went viral

2961
01:56:52,320 --> 01:56:53,556
and it's continuing to happen.

2962
01:56:53,556 --> 01:56:57,320
Part of what we do is educate
people about what this is.

2963
01:56:57,320 --> 01:56:59,180
Part of the work that
other organizations do,

2964
01:56:59,180 --> 01:57:02,060
other national organizations,
National Women's Law Center

2965
01:57:02,060 --> 01:57:04,910
and other organizations like
that are educating people

2966
01:57:04,910 --> 01:57:07,270
but we're also galvanizing people.

2967
01:57:07,270 --> 01:57:08,897
People keep asking, "What
is the Me Too movement

2968
01:57:08,897 --> 01:57:10,910
"gonna do about X," and I'm trying to say

2969
01:57:10,910 --> 01:57:12,640
we're all the Me Too movement.

2970
01:57:12,640 --> 01:57:13,760
You don't put it on one person.

2971
01:57:13,760 --> 01:57:14,593
- [Ali] It's all of our behavior.

2972
01:57:14,593 --> 01:57:15,426
- It's all of us.

2973
01:57:15,426 --> 01:57:16,900
We all have to be responsive.

2974
01:57:16,900 --> 01:57:18,760
We all have to be responsible.

2975
01:57:18,760 --> 01:57:20,150
When something like this happens,

2976
01:57:20,150 --> 01:57:22,530
we all have to be outraged and push back.

2977
01:57:22,530 --> 01:57:26,260
Historically, judicial
systems and political systems

2978
01:57:26,260 --> 01:57:28,130
have to catch up to where the people are.

2979
01:57:28,130 --> 01:57:30,640
The people realize that
stuff like this is awful,

2980
01:57:30,640 --> 01:57:33,240
but we have to push back
and raise our voices

2981
01:57:33,240 --> 01:57:34,800
so that the court systems know

2982
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:37,693
and so that the politicians
know that we won't stand for it.

2983
01:57:37,693 --> 01:57:40,164
- [Ali] Tarana, we appreciate
you coming and helping us

2984
01:57:40,164 --> 01:57:42,520
get smarter about this
and helping our audience.

2985
01:57:42,520 --> 01:57:45,197
Tarana Burke is the founder
of the Me Too movement.

2986
01:57:45,197 --> 01:57:46,030
- Thank you.

2987
01:57:46,030 --> 01:57:46,863
- That wraps up this hour for me.

2988
01:57:46,863 --> 01:57:49,440
I'm back Monday, one p.m.
Eastern, for Velshi & Ruhle.

2989
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:50,590
Have yourselves a great weekend,

2990
01:57:50,590 --> 01:57:51,940
and thank you for watching.

2991
01:57:54,520 --> 01:57:57,510
- My experience with
USAA has been excellent.

2992
01:57:57,510 --> 01:58:00,500
They really appreciate military
family, and it really shows.

2993
01:58:00,500 --> 01:58:03,300
- With all that USAA offers,
why go with anybody else?

2994
01:58:03,300 --> 01:58:04,430
And we know their rates are good.

2995
01:58:04,430 --> 01:58:06,500
We know that they're always
gonna take care of us.

2996
01:58:06,500 --> 01:58:07,590
- It was instant savings,

2997
01:58:07,590 --> 01:58:09,090
and I should have changed a long time ago.

2998
01:58:09,090 --> 01:58:10,820
- It was funny because when we would call

2999
01:58:10,820 --> 01:58:12,797
another insurance company, they would say,

3000
01:58:12,797 --> 01:58:14,380
"Oh, we can't beat USAA."

3001
01:58:14,380 --> 01:58:15,330
- We're the Webber family.

3002
01:58:15,330 --> 01:58:16,163
- We're the Tennys.

3003
01:58:16,163 --> 01:58:19,043
- We're the Hales, and
we're USAA members for life.

3004
01:58:20,100 --> 01:58:23,253
- [Announcer] Get your USAA
auto insurance quote today.

3005
01:58:25,620 --> 01:58:28,480
- [Announcer] Parents have a
way of imagining the worst,

3006
01:58:28,480 --> 01:58:31,743
especially when your easily
distracted teenager has the car.

3007
01:58:36,190 --> 01:58:39,130
At Subaru, we're taking
on distracted driving

3008
01:58:39,130 --> 01:58:42,130
with sensors that alert you
when your eyes are off the road.

3009
01:58:45,450 --> 01:58:50,373
The all new Subaru Forester,
the safest Forester ever.

3010
01:58:54,320 --> 01:58:57,170
- Going to the Shawn
Mendes Verizon Up concert

3011
01:58:57,170 --> 01:58:59,005
was like an out-of-body experience.

3012
01:58:59,005 --> 01:59:01,340
- [Announcer] Why the Yousafzai
sisters chose Verizon.

3013
01:59:01,340 --> 01:59:02,219
- We were right in front of him.

3014
01:59:02,219 --> 01:59:03,052
- Dead center, front row.

3015
01:59:03,052 --> 01:59:05,242
Actually, Zamila, you
touched Shawn Mendes.

3016
01:59:05,242 --> 01:59:06,075
- She touched Shawn Mendes.
- Yeah, I touched him.

3017
01:59:06,075 --> 01:59:07,700
He like held my hand for a while,

3018
01:59:07,700 --> 01:59:09,660
and then we got to meet
him after, which was like--

3019
01:59:09,660 --> 01:59:10,543
- Another surprise.

3020
01:59:10,543 --> 01:59:11,376
- Yeah.

3021
01:59:11,376 --> 01:59:12,209
We love Verizon even more now.

3022
01:59:12,209 --> 01:59:14,300
I'll never forget that day ever.

3023
01:59:14,300 --> 01:59:15,880
- [Announcer] The network
more people rely on

3024
01:59:15,880 --> 01:59:17,660
gives you more, like thousands of tickets

3025
01:59:17,660 --> 01:59:20,070
to concerts, festivals and private shows,

3026
01:59:20,070 --> 01:59:22,050
and big savings on our best phones.

3027
01:59:22,050 --> 01:59:23,020
- Oh, my gosh.

3028
01:59:23,020 --> 01:59:24,080
Wow!

3029
01:59:24,080 --> 01:59:25,540
Who am I?

3030
01:59:25,540 --> 01:59:28,610
- Wow, is that really me? (laughs)

3031
01:59:28,610 --> 01:59:29,920
- [Jonathan] Hi, I'm Jonathan Greenhut,

3032
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:31,640
the CEO of Plexaderm.

3033
01:59:31,640 --> 01:59:33,810
We've created the best offer yet

3034
01:59:33,810 --> 01:59:36,260
with our Plexaderm 10-minute challenge.

3035
01:59:36,260 --> 01:59:38,690
All it takes is 10 minutes
to reduce the appearance

3036
01:59:38,690 --> 01:59:41,250
of under eye bags,
wrinkles and crow's feet.

3037
01:59:41,250 --> 01:59:43,684
Plexaderm works so well, makeup artists

3038
01:59:43,684 --> 01:59:45,723
and even people across the country

3039
01:59:45,723 --> 01:59:48,200
look and feel years younger in minutes.

3040
01:59:48,200 --> 01:59:49,033
- Hi, guys.

3041
01:59:49,033 --> 01:59:50,030
My name is Sandy Maranesi.

3042
01:59:50,030 --> 01:59:52,010
I'm a professional hair and makeup artist.

3043
01:59:52,010 --> 01:59:55,380
And one of the number one
question that I always get

3044
01:59:55,380 --> 01:59:57,790
in my chair is, "Can you
make me look younger?"

3045
01:59:57,790 --> 01:59:59,577
Now I can really say to people,

3046
01:59:59,577 --> 02:00:01,330
"Yes, I can make you look younger."

3047
02:00:01,330 --> 02:00:05,500
- My name is Robin, and this
is what Plexaderm does for me.

3048
02:00:05,500 --> 02:00:06,560
- [Jonathan] The instant results

3049
02:00:06,560 --> 02:00:09,240
are from naturally based
silicates found in shell rock.

3050
02:00:09,240 --> 02:00:11,650
Once applied, your skin
tightens and firms.

3051
02:00:11,650 --> 02:00:14,450
Take action with the
Plexaderm 10-minute challenge.
