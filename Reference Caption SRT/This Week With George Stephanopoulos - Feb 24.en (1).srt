1
00:00:00,316 --> 00:00:02,480
- We've got large hail--
- Rise and shine!

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,150
- [Both] Good morning,
Washington, from Crystal City!

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:07,860
- [Announcer] With ABC 7's Good
Morning Washington weekdays,

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,763
on your side, no matter where you are.

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,460
- [Announcer] The deadly blind
spot right under your nose,

6
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:14,893
tonight after the Oscars.

7
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,820
- [Announcer] This Week
with George Stephanopoulos

8
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,890
starts right now.

9
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,070
- [George] Countdown to Cohen.

10
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,060
- [Reporter] Do you have any concerns

11
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,600
about Michael Cohen's testimony?

12
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,470
- No, no.

13
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,980
- President Trump's former fixer

14
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,230
set to pull back the curtain
on his time with Trump

15
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,220
before three committees in Congress,

16
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,130
Cohen says he'll tell
the truth about Trump

17
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,580
after years of lies.

18
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,750
He's cooperating again with
prosecutors in New York.

19
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,800
Will this new testimony pose
a threat to President Trump,

20
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,740
even after Robert Mueller
completes his investigation?

21
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,030
That and more with House
Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff,

22
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,550
our legal experts, Dan
Abrams and Alan Dershowitz,

23
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,530
and Andrew McCabe, the FBI veteran

24
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,050
whose new tell-all is
drawing fire from Trump.

25
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,232
And--

26
00:00:54,232 --> 00:00:55,065
- There's been no nuclear testing,

27
00:00:55,065 --> 00:00:56,380
no missiles, no rockets.

28
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,980
- A second summit with
North Korea just days away,

29
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,720
but no signs yet that North Korea's

30
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,780
ready to give up its nuclear arsenal.

31
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,660
Will a second meeting with Kim Jong-un

32
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,280
bring real progress?

33
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,680
Insight and analysis from
our panel of experts,

34
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,190
including the ambassador who
negotiated with North Korea,

35
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,250
Bill Richardson.

36
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,100
Plus, Bernie is back.

37
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:19,070
- And our 2016 campaign began
the political revolution.

38
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,940
Now, it is time to
complete that revolution.

39
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,460
- His staying power shocked
the political world in 2016.

40
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,310
His national movement is
a fundraising juggernaut.

41
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:30,940
But can he stand out in
this cycle's wide-open race

42
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:31,970
for the White House?

43
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:33,470
Our powerhouse roundtable weighs in

44
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,100
on what's at stake in
2020, the issues in play,

45
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,470
and who's making headway
in these early rounds.

46
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:41,364
We'll break down the
politics, smoke out the spin.

47
00:01:41,364 --> 00:01:42,953
The facts that matter this week.

48
00:01:44,108 --> 00:01:47,020
- [Announcer] From ABC
News, it's This Week.

49
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:50,343
Here now, chief anchor
George Stephanopoulos.

50
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,550
- Good morning and welcome to This Week.

51
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,290
It is a big week ahead for the president

52
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,630
on two very different fronts.

53
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,930
Tomorrow he boards Air
Force One for Vietnam,

54
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,060
the site of the second
summit with North Korea's

55
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,040
Kim Jong-un, who's already
on his way to Hanoi.

56
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,160
You see him there in
his armored train that's

57
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,120
arriving in China yesterday.

58
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,620
But just as Trump tries to strike

59
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,570
a nuclear deal with Kim Jong-un,

60
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:14,560
Michael Cohen will take
the Washington spotlight.

61
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,490
Three days of hearings on Capitol Hill,

62
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,670
including blockbuster public testimony

63
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,360
in the House on Wednesday.

64
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,360
Cohen's lawyer says
he's prepared to reveal

65
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,910
damning details of his years
as Trump's attorney and fixer,

66
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,630
promising a chilling
portrait of the president.

67
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:31,410
It comes as Cohen continues
to cooperate with prosecutors,

68
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,430
offering leads into possible corruption

69
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,500
of the Trump inaugural,

70
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,870
and insurance irregularities
at the Trump organization.

71
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,280
And that investigation in
New York's Southern District

72
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,280
is just one of several probes poised

73
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,380
to challenge the president well beyond

74
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,380
the end of Robert Mueller's work.

75
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,450
We start with the man leading
one of those investigations,

76
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,350
the Chair of the House Intelligence
Committee, Adam Schiff.

77
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:53,016
Congressman Schiff, thank you
for joining us this morning.

78
00:02:53,016 --> 00:02:53,849
- Thank you, George.

79
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:55,210
- Michael Cohen is going to
appear before your committee

80
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,098
behind closed doors on Thursday.

81
00:02:57,098 --> 00:02:58,810
What do you hope to learn from him

82
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,700
that you don't already know?

83
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,340
- Well a great deal,
starting with why the false

84
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,510
statements before our committee
when he first appeared.

85
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,410
Did they go beyond what he told us

86
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:12,230
about Moscow Trump Tower
into other areas as well?

87
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,430
Who would have been aware
of the false testimony

88
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,720
that he was giving?

89
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,760
What other light can he shed
now that he's cooperating

90
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,080
on issues of obstruction
of justice or collusion?

91
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,630
What more can he tell us about the

92
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,570
Trump Tower New York meeting?

93
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,380
Or any other issues relevant
to our investigation.

94
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,310
We think he has a lot to offer.

95
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,450
- How about on the finances
of the Trump organization?

96
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,487
You've suggested that's the new front

97
00:03:34,487 --> 00:03:37,263
in your committee's investigation.

98
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,000
- Well this is something,
George as you know,

99
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,080
I've been concerned
about for two years now.

100
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,216
We weren't really permitted
to explore it in great detail

101
00:03:45,216 --> 00:03:47,780
when the Republicans were
running the committee,

102
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,030
but we know already, and Michael
Cohen is pivotal to this,

103
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,320
the peril of ignoring or
observing this red line

104
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,620
of the president's and
ignoring the financial issues,

105
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,630
what we have learned to date

106
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:02,370
about Moscow Trump Tower is chilling.

107
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:05,850
That is, as Donald Trump was
campaigning for president,

108
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,930
even when he became
the presumptive nominee

109
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,490
of the Republican Party,
and was telling the country

110
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,410
he had no business dealings with Russia,

111
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,650
he was privately,
through his organization,

112
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,720
seeking the Kremlin's help to make what

113
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,490
may have been the most
lucrative deal of his life,

114
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:22,080
even reportedly offering
an inducement to Putin

115
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,490
to make it happen, and at the same time,

116
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,420
talking about removing
sanctions on Russia,

117
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,160
something very important to Russians.

118
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,590
That is deeply compromising,
whether it's criminal or not,

119
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:35,260
it is deeply compromising
of our national security.

120
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,040
So those issues have to be probed,

121
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,940
and they include money laundering as well.

122
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,790
- That gets to a question about
the Mueller investigation.

123
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:43,040
If it turns out, as the
president has said so many times,

124
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,920
he did not collude with the Russians

125
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,590
to interfere in the election,

126
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,470
but in fact he was pursuing this

127
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,560
Trump Tower at the same time.

128
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,240
If that's not criminal, does Mueller have

129
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,935
a responsibility to report it or no?

130
00:04:54,935 --> 00:04:58,200
- He does have a
responsibility to report it,

131
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,520
and in fact, if you take the position,

132
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,760
and I think it's a flawed one,

133
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,870
but if you take the position that

134
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,510
the president cannot be indicted,

135
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:08,740
and the only remedy for improper, illegal,

136
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,530
or other conduct is impeachment,

137
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:14,140
then you cannot withhold that
information from Congress

138
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,990
or essentially the president has immunity.

139
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:20,030
So that cannot be allowed to be the case.

140
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:23,890
Bob, or Bill Barr has
committed in his testimony

141
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:27,770
to making as much of the
report public as he can,

142
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:30,270
and the regulations allow
him to make it all public.

143
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,650
We're going to insist
on it becoming public,

144
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,610
and more than that, George,
we're going to insist

145
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:37,930
on the underlying
evidence because there is

146
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,460
certain evidence that
is only in the hands of

147
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,870
The Department of Justice that
we can't get any other way.

148
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,770
There were searches
conducted, for example,

149
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,985
of Roger Stone and Paul Manafort.

150
00:05:46,985 --> 00:05:49,570
There's no other way
to get the information

151
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,160
that was seized except
through the Department.

152
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,450
We can't tell the country
fully what happened without it.

153
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,470
- As you know, William Barr
may have quite a different view

154
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,160
of what those regulation
require than you do.

155
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,440
They could allow him to
release the entire report,

156
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,361
but under Justice Department regulations,

157
00:06:03,361 --> 00:06:05,870
officials have said that if you decline

158
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,850
to prosecute someone, then
the underlying evidence

159
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,418
should not be released.

160
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:13,964
- But George, the Department
has violated that policy

161
00:06:13,964 --> 00:06:18,200
repeatedly and extendedly
to a great extent

162
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,700
over the last two years, and in fact,

163
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,890
I've had this conversation
with Rod Rosenstein

164
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:24,640
and others on down at
the Justice Department

165
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,990
as they turned over
thousands and thousands

166
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:30,700
of pages of discovery in the
Clinton email investigation

167
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:34,040
and there was no indictment
in that investigation.

168
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,990
This was a new precedent
they were setting,

169
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,490
and they were gonna have
to live by this precedent,

170
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,660
whether it was a Congress
controlled by the Democrats

171
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:45,900
or Republicans, so they're
gonna have to abide by that,

172
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,830
and I think also,

173
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,820
quite separate and apart from
the precedent already set,

174
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:53,320
is the intense public need to know here,

175
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,750
which I think overrides
any other considerations.

176
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,070
- You say the Justice
Department is gonna have to live

177
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,660
by that precedent, but what if they don't?

178
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,440
What if they simply
say no, we're not gonna

179
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,520
release the underlying evidence.

180
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,480
What options do you have?

181
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,100
- Well, we will obviously
subpoena the report,

182
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,870
we will bring Bob Mueller in
to testify before Congress,

183
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,170
we will take it to court if necessary.

184
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,788
And in the end, I think
the Department understands,

185
00:07:14,788 --> 00:07:17,130
they're going to have to make this public.

186
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:20,150
I think Barr will ultimately
understand that as well.

187
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:23,050
Barr comes into this job
with two strikes against him.

188
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,710
He applied for the job by demonstrating

189
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,780
a bias against the Mueller investigation.

190
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,530
Indeed that's part of
the reason he was hired.

191
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,410
He's also not been willing to commit to

192
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,970
following the advice of ethics lawyers.

193
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,720
Indeed that was part of
the reason he was hired.

194
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,470
If he were to try to
withhold, to try to bury

195
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:42,900
any part of this report,
that will be his legacy,

196
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,550
and it will be a tarnished legacy.

197
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,510
So I think there will be immense pressure,

198
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:49,230
not only on the Department
but on the Attorney General

199
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,180
to be forthcoming.

200
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,227
- You're talking about public pressure?

201
00:07:51,227 --> 00:07:53,820
Are you prepared to take
the Administration to court?

202
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,170
- Absolutely.

203
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,440
We are gonna get to the bottom of this.

204
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,570
We are gonna share this
information with the public,

205
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:02,960
and if the president is
serious about all of his

206
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,330
claims of exoneration, then he should

207
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,550
welcome the publication of this report.

208
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,940
- The president has said no
collusion many times as I said.

209
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,760
You said many months
ago that you've already

210
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,790
developed evidence of collusion.

211
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:16,230
We haven't seen that from Robert Mueller.

212
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:19,233
Do you have any evidence at all
that the president colluded?

213
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,470
- George, there's ample
evidence of collusion

214
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,787
of the campaign and it's very
much in the public record.

215
00:08:25,787 --> 00:08:28,880
And it's everything from
what we have seen recently

216
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,120
about Paul Manafort
meeting with someone linked

217
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,010
to Russian intelligence
and sharing polling data.

218
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,960
And not top line data, not
this is why we think Trump

219
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,920
is gonna win data, but raw
data, complicated data.

220
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,340
We've seen evidence of Roger Stone

221
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,430
in communication with WikiLeaks.

222
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:48,170
We've seen the president's
son having a secret meeting

223
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:51,240
at Trump Tower that was
presented to him as part of

224
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,860
the Russian government's effort
to help the Trump campaign.

225
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:58,020
His acceptance of that help
is interesting, getting that.

226
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,890
All of this is evidence of collusion,

227
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,950
and there's much, much more.

228
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:06,160
Whether that will amount
to a criminal conspiracy

229
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,260
that can be proved beyond
a reasonable doubt,

230
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,090
we will have to wait for
Bob Mueller to tell us,

231
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:15,660
but to not see what is
plainly in front of us,

232
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,206
means you basically don't
wanna see the evidence

233
00:09:18,206 --> 00:09:20,760
of collusion because it is quite abundant.

234
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,900
- Congressman Schiff, thank
you for your time this morning.

235
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,880
- [Schiff] Thanks George.

236
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,941
- Let's bring in our legal panel,

237
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:25,774
our Chief Legal Analyst, Dan Abrams,

238
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:28,440
also Harvard Law School
Professor Emeritus,

239
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,773
Alan Dershowitz, author of

240
00:09:29,773 --> 00:09:31,270
The Case Against the Democratic
House Impeaching Trump,

241
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,400
and Dan, let me begin with you.

242
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,240
Let's pick up with what
I was talking about

243
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,720
with Congressman Schiff right there.

244
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,770
He says that Bill Barr is gonna be

245
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,100
under tremendous pressure to release

246
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,650
whatever Mueller has reported publicly.

247
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,500
It's not clear that Barr agrees with that.

248
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,333
- That's right.

249
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:50,540
Barr has made it very
clear that he's going to

250
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:55,540
release as much as he can, but
he has put caveats on that.

251
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,880
The question's gonna be, for example,

252
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,620
how much information in there potentially

253
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,450
could be a national security threat?

254
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,040
And I think you need to separate out

255
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,230
the difference between the report itself

256
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,580
and the underlying information.

257
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,210
'Cause you heard Congressman Schiff there

258
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,360
talk about some of the
underlying information.

259
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,100
That's gonna be harder to get.

260
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,010
- Even though it was all released in

261
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,010
the Clinton investigation?

262
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:16,843
- Correct.

263
00:10:16,843 --> 00:10:18,290
Well look, you have to
remember that the current

264
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:21,590
Special Counsel law was a response

265
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:24,270
to the Clinton investigation,
meaning there were concerns

266
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,103
about how much-

267
00:10:25,103 --> 00:10:25,936
- [George] The Bill Clinton investigation,

268
00:10:25,936 --> 00:10:27,316
you're talking about the
Hillary investigation.

269
00:10:27,316 --> 00:10:28,263
- Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

270
00:10:28,263 --> 00:10:29,322
I was talking about
the Bill, you're right.

271
00:10:29,322 --> 00:10:31,070
In response to the Bill
Clinton investigation,

272
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,900
this was a response to that law.

273
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,360
On the Hillary Clinton investigation,

274
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,880
look, I don't think
there's a direct comparison

275
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,920
between the Hillary Clinton investigation

276
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,600
and the Special Counsel investigation.

277
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,710
I do think that there is a much stronger

278
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:47,930
argument to say that a
Special Counsel investigation

279
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:51,230
ought to be made public, even
if there is no prosecution.

280
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:54,810
That the decision making process for them,

281
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:57,560
that the report should be made public,

282
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,830
even if, and typically in
the Department of Justice,

283
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,705
you wouldn't release
information related to

284
00:11:02,705 --> 00:11:04,840
an investigation that was not prosecuted.

285
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,360
- What's your response to that Alan?

286
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,380
- Well I think that's exactly the issue.

287
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,500
Democrats were appropriately furious,

288
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,560
I was among them, when Comey,

289
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,670
after saying that he was not gonna indict

290
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:20,470
Hillary Clinton then went
on to give his own opinion

291
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,930
as to her wrong-doing.

292
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:26,760
And the question is, is there
a difference between Comey,

293
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,970
who did wrong, everybody
now acknowledges that,

294
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:32,790
and a Special Counsel who has

295
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:35,230
had a broader mandate to investigate.

296
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,300
Look, let's be realistic.

297
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,810
In the end, everything's gonna come out.

298
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:38,950
There are no secrets.

299
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:41,570
In the end, it's all gonna come out.

300
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,930
And in the end, as I've said from day one,

301
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,050
it would have been so much better

302
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:50,340
if we had a non-partisan,
independent commission

303
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,170
like they have in England and in Israel,

304
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,300
like we had after 9/11,
getting to the whole truth

305
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,600
in a non-partisan way.

306
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,493
The American public's not gonna trust

307
00:11:58,493 --> 00:11:59,813
a Democratic controlled House
- Let me stop you on that.

308
00:11:59,813 --> 00:12:01,450
- They're not going to trust

309
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,070
the Republican controlled Senate.

310
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,650
- I'll take your point on the Congress,

311
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,343
but Robert Mueller was
about as non-partisan

312
00:12:06,343 --> 00:12:08,850
a figure as you could
have found, isn't he?

313
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,880
- That's the point, no
that's the point now I think.

314
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,120
My point is that if his
information is not released

315
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,850
to the public, and it
then goes to Congress

316
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:19,320
to conduct the investigation,
I think there'll be

317
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,350
a question of credibility.

318
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,390
Look I think, and I've said from day one,

319
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,810
that President Trump's
greatest vulnerability

320
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,950
lies not with the Mueller report,

321
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,690
but with the Southern
District of New York,

322
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:32,250
and with the New York
Attorney General's office,

323
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,840
and with other prosecutorial arms that

324
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,310
can look into conduct unrelated
to collusion to Russia,

325
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:42,140
but conduct that preceded his presidency,

326
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,250
and I think that's where the problems

327
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,910
can come up in the future.

328
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,600
This may be just the beginning.

329
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,654
The Mueller report may be just a road map

330
00:12:49,654 --> 00:12:52,660
given to Congress and
given to other prosecutors

331
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,840
that will continue these investigations

332
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,400
until the end of President
Trump's first term.

333
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,080
- I wanna pick up on that with Dan.

334
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,170
It does appear that we might be having

335
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:01,480
something of a Mueller
strategy in plain sight.

336
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,920
Every indictment he has
lays out in great detail

337
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,130
what he thought happened.

338
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,130
Meantime, things that
he thinks may be a bit

339
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:11,710
beyond his scope, he siphons
off to other prosecutors.

340
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,430
- Right, and I think
Alan's right that that

341
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:15,720
poses an enormous danger
to him as these other

342
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,490
offices because you can't just say

343
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:20,036
oh, well the Southern District
of New York is out to get me,

344
00:13:20,036 --> 00:13:22,430
the Eastern District of
New York is out to get me,

345
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,210
and Virginia's out to get me, et cetera.

346
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,950
That's a tough argument to make.

347
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:28,380
But when you look at some
of the documents that have

348
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,637
been filed, for example
in the Manafort case,

349
00:13:30,637 --> 00:13:32,790
and you talk about the
road map, you have to

350
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,710
ask the question in the big picture,

351
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:37,200
why so much still redacted, right?

352
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,180
Why are they still not allowing the public

353
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:43,070
to see so much related to
the Russia investigation?

354
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:45,000
Why isn't Michael Cohen being allowed to

355
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,190
testify in public about
the Russia investigation?

356
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,750
- He's only going to be talking
about other investigations.

357
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,190
- Right, about ten other
topics not related to Russians.

358
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,900
You have to ask yourself,
if there's nothing else

359
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,330
that's gonna come out, why
are they redacting so much?

360
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:58,610
- Alan, that was something curious.

361
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:01,120
800 pages from Robert Mueller yesterday

362
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,281
in the Manafort sentencing memo,

363
00:14:03,281 --> 00:14:04,490
yet nothing about the underlying things

364
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:05,670
that he may have been lying about.

365
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,160
His meetings with various Russians,

366
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,510
and they say the redactions
were for ongoing investigations

367
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,360
and uncharged individuals.

368
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,910
That does suggest more to come.

369
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,330
- Oh absolutely, I have
no doubt about that.

370
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,950
I think these redactions are a clue

371
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:23,490
to what may be hinted at.

372
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:26,240
Look also, I think we
are seeing now an effort

373
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,330
to tamp down expectations from
the Mueller report itself.

374
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:34,440
I think we're being told
don't expect smoking guns,

375
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,950
don't expect dynamite in the report.

376
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:40,800
The report is gonna be the beginning of

377
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,780
some other investigations
coming down the line.

378
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,350
So I think there's a combination.

379
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:48,090
Don't expect too much from
the Mueller report itself,

380
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:52,040
but the Mueller report may
lead to greater investigations

381
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,670
by a variety of other institutions.

382
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,960
So this, the Mueller
report is not gonna mark

383
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,270
the end of the investigation.

384
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:00,070
I think that's the message we're hearing.

385
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,840
- Dan, so much of the report
and the Mueller report

386
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,840
is unfounded because Robert
Mueller isn't talking.

387
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,200
But there has been some rather aggressive

388
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,240
backgrounding going on suggesting
that the Mueller report

389
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,370
will be an anti-climax.

390
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:15,350
- Yeah, I mean, look, and the
expectation game is critical

391
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,550
when it comes to public perception.

392
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,400
But whether it's a summary, whether it's

393
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,400
a detailed accounting, don't forget,

394
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,430
we already have a lot of information.

395
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,220
I'm not talking just about
what Congressman Schiff

396
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,080
was talking about.

397
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,150
I'm talking about the
indictments that currently exist.

398
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:33,009
When people wanna know what happened

399
00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:35,770
leading up to the 2016 election,

400
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:38,180
you have to start by
reading the indictments.

401
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,850
You have to start by
reading the indictments

402
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:40,780
of the Russians.

403
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:44,430
And then ask yourself,
okay, was anyone else

404
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:45,290
connected to them?

405
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,270
And that's what they're trying
to piece together still.

406
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:51,320
That's why when you
have Papadopoulos lying,

407
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,790
Flynn lying about Russia,

408
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:55,580
you've got Manafort lying, et cetera,

409
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,850
you have to ask yourself why are all these

410
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,440
people not telling the
truth about, and the answer

411
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,690
may simply be look, I wanted to

412
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:03,760
distance myself from it.

413
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,720
I didn't wanna get in trouble

414
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,110
in connection with this thing.

415
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:09,430
But there are still critical
questions that are unanswered.

416
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,630
There's a ton of redacted material,

417
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:14,340
and I think we're gonna
to see some answers.

418
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,630
- [George] And we're still
waiting for Robert Mueller--

419
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,480
- Let's remember, though--

420
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,313
- [George] Go ahead.

421
00:16:18,313 --> 00:16:19,420
- Let's remember that indictments are

422
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,450
different than convictions.

423
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:23,510
A lot of this is indictments.

424
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,500
Remember, too, we're gonna see

425
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,090
a rebuttal report from the Trump team.

426
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,900
So I think the American
public should withhold

427
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,760
final judgment until
they see both reports,

428
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,890
the Mueller report and the
response by the Trump team.

429
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,740
- Well this will be the first
time in the history of America

430
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,530
where a defendant or someone
who's accused of something

431
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:42,120
gets to write a response report
to what an indictment is.

432
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,150
Every criminal defendant in America

433
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:46,510
would love to be able to
write their own report

434
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,640
about what they say happened,

435
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,617
but that's not the way the system works.

436
00:16:49,617 --> 00:16:51,456
- But you're contradicting yourself.

437
00:16:51,456 --> 00:16:52,289
- How?

438
00:16:52,289 --> 00:16:54,150
- Because this is not just a yes or no.

439
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,890
You're saying that the Special Counsel

440
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,700
have special obligations
to release everything,

441
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,130
and if they have a special
obligation to release everything,

442
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:04,016
then there's an obligation
to allow a response.

443
00:17:04,016 --> 00:17:05,345
- You can allow, that's fine.
- That's precisely the point.

444
00:17:05,345 --> 00:17:07,181
- Let them respond.
- If it was just yes or no,

445
00:17:07,181 --> 00:17:09,110
then you wouldn't need a response,

446
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:11,510
but if you get a long, long narrative,

447
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:14,068
then fairness requires a response.

448
00:17:14,068 --> 00:17:14,901
- That's fine, let 'em respond.

449
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:16,170
- And simultaneous release of both.

450
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,210
- Whoa, simultaneous release of both, too?

451
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,857
So now basically--
- Right.

452
00:17:19,857 --> 00:17:20,950
- Right, look.

453
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,620
That's just, that's ridiculous.

454
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:25,370
The idea that you have
to allow the other side

455
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:27,440
in something like this,
the opportunity to file

456
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,630
a long report in response to a prosecutor.

457
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:31,930
- You don't have to do that if

458
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:34,570
you just limit yourself to
indictment or not indictment.

459
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:37,450
If you go beyond it and
you start telling a story,

460
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:40,360
the other side of the narrative
has to be produced as well.

461
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,539
That's required by
fairness and due process.

462
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:43,372
- Bill Clinton would have loved that.

463
00:17:43,372 --> 00:17:44,490
- Not in the regulations.

464
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:45,610
Okay, thank you both very much.

465
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:47,220
- [Alan] Well he should have gotten it.

466
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,360
- When we come back, his new book

467
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,730
is drawing fire from President Trump,

468
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:52,670
former FBI Deputy Director
Andrew McCabe up next.

469
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,770
And later the powerhouse
round table takes on 2020.

470
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:55,770
We'll be right back.

471
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,790
- [Announcer] This Week
with George Stephanopoulos

472

sponsored by Pacific Life

477
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,400
will you act or feel different?

478
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,040
Or will you just be you,

of a full time job?

you can plan for, but
surprise pizza at the office

490
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,140
means heartburn you didn't expect.

not living up to the hype?

One jar shatters the competition.

502
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:17,660
Olay Regenerist hydrates
skin better than creams

503
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:21,150
costing over 100, 200, and even $400.

- For singing, definitely dry mouth

507
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,620
has been a problem for me.

508
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,180
I'm also on a lot of
medications that dry my mouth.

509
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,520
I just drank tons of water all the time,

510
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,510
it was never enough.

511
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,080
I wasn't sure I was going to be able

512
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,130
to continue singing.

513
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:42,010
I saw my dentist, he suggested Biotene.

514
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:45,360
It feels refreshing, my
mouth felt more lubricated.

515
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,800
I use Biotene rinse twice a day,

516
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,970
then I use the spray throughout the day.

517
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:52,696
It actually saved my career in a way.

518
00:19:52,696 --> 00:19:54,546
Biotene really did make a difference.

534
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,540

551
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,050
does your house still smell stuffy?

552
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:26,470
That's because your home is
filled with soft surfaces

553
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:29,890
that trap odors and release
them back into the room.

554
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:32,060
Try Febreze Fabric Refresher.

And this is Charlie still
not coughing while trying

his hardest not to wake Zeus.

567

perform together live on
the Oscars, ABC tonight.

571
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:13,670
- [Narrator] There are
parents, neighbors, loved ones

572
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:16,720
living with diseases
like cancer, epilepsy,

573
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,340
mental health conditions, and HIV.

574
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,930
Maybe you're one of them.

575
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:23,750
But new Medicare rules could
deny access to the latest

576
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:28,720
most effective therapies,
therapies that keep them healthy.

577
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,813
Are Medicare cuts that save less than 1%

578
00:22:31,813 --> 00:22:34,550
worth the risk to millions of patients?

579
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:37,690
President Trump promised
to protect Medicare.

580
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,110
We need him to keep his word.

581

- Why now may be the best
time to book a cruise.

Tuesday on Good Morning Washington.

583
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,280
- I think Andrew McCabe has
made a fool out of himself

584
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,630
over the last couple of days,

585
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:53,150
and he really looks to me
like sort of a poor man's

586
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,790
J. Edgar Hoover.

587
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,670
He's a, I think he's a disaster,

588
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:59,780
and what he was trying to do was terrible,

589
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,270
and he was caught.

590
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:03,500
I'm very proud to say we caught him,

591
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,750
so we'll see what happens.

592
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,833
But he is a disgraced man.

593
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:11,120
- President Trump taking on
our next guest, Andrew McCabe.

594
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,310
His new book The Threat:
How the FBI Protects

595
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,730
America in the Age of Terror and Trump

596
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:18,240
takes us behind the scenes at the launch

597
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,200
of the Mueller investigation.

598
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,740
Welcome to This Week.

599
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,143
Poor man's J. Edgar Hoover?

600
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,682
- I don't even know what that means.

601
00:23:24,682 --> 00:23:27,040
It's not the first time
that I've had to listen

602
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,380
to the president say bizarre
and untrue things about me.

603
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:32,370
So it's unfortunate that this is getting

604
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:35,540
a little bit routine, but I will say,

605
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:38,305
I don't think there's
anything sad or unfortunate

606
00:23:38,305 --> 00:23:42,070
about speaking truth to
power and telling the story

607
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:44,530
that you lived and the
things you saw and heard

608
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:46,500
and the reasons behind
the decisions you made,

609
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,650
and that's what I'm trying
to do with the book.

610
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,250
- Another man who's got
a reputation for speaking

611
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,410
truth to power, Robert
Mueller, you worked for him

612
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:53,330
- [Andrew] I did.

613
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:54,163
- At the FBI.

614
00:23:54,163 --> 00:23:55,340
Based on what you know,

615
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,490
and you heard our previous discussion,

616
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:59,086
what should we expect from Robert Mueller?

617
00:23:59,086 --> 00:24:02,372
Kind of a narrow by the
book prosecutor reporting,

618
00:24:02,372 --> 00:24:04,460
or someone who senses he has a broader

619
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,430
responsibility to the public?

620
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:08,070
- That's a great question, George.

621
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,030
I think first and foremost, what you can

622
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:13,130
expect from Robert Mueller
is an honest, independent

623
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:15,170
assessment of the work that they've done.

624
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:17,315
How much detail he chooses to go into

625
00:24:17,315 --> 00:24:19,530
to convey to the Department of Justice

626
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:20,390
is a great question.

627
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:23,000
I hope they lean on the detailed side.

628
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,960
This is not a normal
investigation by any evaluation.

629
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,630
It's one that I think
the Department, Congress,

630
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:31,920
and the public have an enormous interest

631
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,167
in finding out just
exactly what they learned.

632
00:24:33,167 --> 00:24:35,070
- And it's complicated in so many ways,

633
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,030
including the precedent

634
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:39,260
of the Hillary Clinton investigation.

635
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:43,140
The FBI released all that
information about her

636
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,220
as you heard Alan Dershowitz say,

637
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,750
James Comey criticized for that.

638
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,020
Was that the wrong
decision by James Comey?

639
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:52,320
- I absolutely agreed
with Director Comey's

640
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,572
approach at the time, and
since have had the benefit

641
00:24:55,572 --> 00:24:59,620
of some reconsideration of
those things that we did.

642
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,150
I think I'm pretty clear
about it in the book,

643
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:04,534
I think that decision
was not well thought.

644
00:25:04,534 --> 00:25:08,000
I think we underestimated
the kind of political

645
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,790
toxicity of the environment that we were

646
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,290
launching our conclusions into,

647
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:13,570
and I think we overestimated our ability

648
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:15,780
and Jim's ability to convince people

649
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,280
of the great work that we had done.

650
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,300
- It is now a precedent, and in releasing

651
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,670
the entire underlying case file
is now a precedent as well.

652
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:25,810
Is it one the FBI should
follow in this investigation?

653
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:29,540
- I'm not sure that Jim's
decision to announce it in July

654
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,910
is a precedent.

655
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:33,840
However, I think that
it is a very concerning

656
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,440
and now recent precedent,
the volume of information

657
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,130
that the FBI turned over
to Congress in the wake of,

658
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:42,520
after the investigation was concluded.

659
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,410
That is something that
concerned me greatly

660
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:48,300
at that time, and I thought,
you know this is a practice

661
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,930
that will be hard to step away from.

662
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:52,460
- You made the decision to
investigate the president,

663
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,500
the opening investigation
into to the president

664
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,790
has come under some criticism this week

665
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:58,080
including from Congressman
Mark Meadows who says

666
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:58,913
you made a stunning admission.

667
00:25:58,913 --> 00:26:01,012
You wanna put up his tweet.

668
00:26:01,012 --> 00:26:03,140
Right there where you said it was

669
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,930
because of suspicious behavior

670
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,900
by the president on
intercept source reporting

671
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,550
or other secret evidence.

672
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:11,173
Congressman Meadows says
that is an abuse of power.

673
00:26:12,229 --> 00:26:15,690
- I'm not sure what
he's referring to there,

674
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:17,700
but I can tell you that the information

675
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,080
that was in our hands at the time,

676
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,610
much of which was publicly known,

677
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:22,982
caused us great concern.

678
00:26:22,982 --> 00:26:25,360
- You say us, but this was
your decision, correct?

679
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,740
- This was the recommendation
from the investigative team

680
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,870
and it was ultimately
my decision to authorize

681
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:32,210
the opening of the case,
and I did that because,

682
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:34,690
at the time, the facts clearly indicated

683
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:37,350
that we had an articulable
basis to believe

684
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:39,570
that a crime may have been committed

685
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:42,520
and that a threat to national
security might exist.

686
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,571
We hadn't concluded that
either of those two things

687
00:26:44,571 --> 00:26:47,050
had happened, but we were
certainly in the place

688
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:48,940
that we needed to investigate both sides.

689
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,110
- You'd make the same decision today?

690
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,070
- [Andrew] Absolutely.

691
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:54,390
- You're also planning
on filing a civil lawsuit

692
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,460
against President Trump.

693
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,730
What grounds do you have to sue,

694
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:58,000
and what do you hope to get from it?

695
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,610
- Well, I can't talk in great
detail about the lawsuit,

696
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,860
I'll certainly let the
pleadings speak for themselves.

697
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,100
It'll be an action against
the Department of Justice

698
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:10,100
primarily, and challenging the
circumstances of my firing.

699
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,210
It of course derives from
the Inspector General Report,

700
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:15,290
a report that I deeply disagree with,

701
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:17,290
a report that was the result of a process

702
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:19,530
that I don't think anyone
has ever seen before,

703
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,067
I certainly hadn't.

704
00:27:21,067 --> 00:27:22,600
(clears throat) Excuse me.

705
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,350
- Do you think the president
inspired that process?

706
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,740
- There's no doubt in my
mind that the president's

707
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:31,040
clear desire impacted that process.

708
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,850
The president was
talking about removing me

709
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:35,120
from months before I ever interacted with

710
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,380
the Inspector General.

711
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:40,680
He made his desires perfectly
clear on his own Twitter feed.

712
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,100
The Inspector General
delivered that result.

713
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,270
- Andrew McCabe, thanks very much.

714
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,103
- [Andrew] Thank you, George.

715
00:27:45,103 --> 00:27:47,133
- Roundtable's up next,
we'll be right back.

716
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,850
- [Narrator] All money
managers might seem the same,

717
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:54,730
but some give their clients
cookie cutter portfolios.

718
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:56,720
Fisher Investments tailors portfolios

719
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,300
to your goals and needs.

720
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,760
Some only call when they
have something to sell.

721
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,730
Fisher calls regularly,
so you stay informed.

722
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:06,100
And while some advisors are
happy to earn commissions

723
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,810
whether you do well or not,

724
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,450
Fisher Investments' fees are structured

725
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:11,930
so we do better when you do better.

726
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:14,000
Maybe that's why most of our clients

727
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,010
come from other money managers.

728
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:19,180
Fisher Investments, clearly
better money management.

729
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,410
- How's your cough?

730
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:22,500
- I'm good, I took this 12 Hour Mucinex

731
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,320
and sent it far away.

732
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,670
- Hey buddy, have you seen
a nice woman with a cough?

733
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:28,790
Whoa!

734
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,200
- [Narrator] Mucinex DM release fast

735
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,940
and lasts 12 hours, not four.

736
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,330
Send coughs far away, all day.

737
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:37,210
- [Narrator] Think only
specialty stores have what's new?

738
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:39,770
Olay has the hottest debut.

739
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:43,393
New Olay clay stick masks,
hydrating facial mists,

740
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,893
and brightening eye cream.

741
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,513
Only by Olay.

Vitamin C than Emergen-C.

00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,350
- [Narrator] Okay, so
when the New York Times

750
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:09,160
calls you one of the eight news podcasts

751

worth listening to, well,
you just say thank you.

(sighs)
it's Thursday.

758
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:33,110
Good thing they discovered Gain Flings,

759
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:35,710
the only detergent with concentrated Gain,

760
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:38,343
Oxi boost, and Febreze odor remover.

761
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,650
Mm-hmm, smelling is believing,

762
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:44,433
and Gain Flings can
hi-yah karate stink, too.

763

that whitens my teeth

00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,470
or one that's good for my teeth?

can be there for anybody.

875
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:44,140
- I'm in this fight
because I truly do believe

876
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,460
this is our moment.

877
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:49,860

- First vote's a year away,

885

Heidi Heitkamp, former Democratic

Rachael Bade, the new

for the Washington Post, welcome to you.

893
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:20,900
Patrick Gaspard, president of

894
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,230
Political Affairs Director
in the Obama White House,

And Alex Castellanos,

also an ABC News contributor.

898
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,213
Patrick, let me begin with you

899
00:35:30,213 --> 00:35:31,770
and the case of Bernie Sanders.

900
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:33,680
He says he's going to
win this time around,

901
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,600
lot of questions, 77 years
old, already targeted

902
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,470
by the president as a
Democratic Socialist,

903
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,797
but 24 hours into his announcement,

904
00:35:40,797 --> 00:35:43,627
$6 million in contributions
from that fundraising base.

905
00:35:43,627 --> 00:35:45,500
- $6 million in right away

906
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,770
and another $600,000 from people

907
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,210
who have pledged to give
him every single month.

908
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:52,520
It's like the Netflix model of fundraising

909
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,800
for a presidential campaign.

910
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,030
But he's going to have
an interesting challenge

911
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,070
this time around.

912
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:59,080
I worked on Howard
Dean's campaign in 2004.

913
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,710
- Against John Kerry.
- Against John Kerry

914
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:01,810
and everybody else in the world,

915
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:04,200
and early on in that
contest, there was a sense

916
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,730
that it was a battle
for the hearts and minds

917
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,930
of the Democratic party,
but at some point,

918
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:10,240
in Iowa and New Hampshire,
South Carolina early on,

919
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,040
Democrats decided we
don't want a revolution,

920
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,610
we just wanna beat George Bush,

921
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:15,430
and we've got to find
somebody the most electable.

922
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:17,380
I think that Bernie Sanders
is going to find this time,

923
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,740
people don't want a revolution,

924
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:19,790
they wanna beat Donald Trump.

925
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:22,340
- Heidi Heitkamp, it brings
up an interesting point.

926
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,730
Bernie Sanders, his
ideas have been adopted

927
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:28,040
by many other candidates,
many other Democrats,

928
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,890
but there is that concern that he's gonna

929
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:31,340
pull the party too far to the left.

930
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,400
- Well I think that a couple
things are gonna happen.

931
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,990
You're gonna see people get in

932
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:37,610
who are gonna broaden the
scope of Democratic ideas,

933
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:39,420
that are gonna be put on the forefront,

934
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,420
but to the point of the money.

935
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:44,030
Money doesn't matter as
much as what it used to,

936
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:46,170
in my opinion, and when you step back,

937
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:49,290
and you take a look at
kind of the record crowds

938
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,920
that everybody's enjoying in Iowa,

939
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,010
I mean people are coming out
because they wanna examine

940
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:58,520
each candidate and pick the candidate who,

941
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,670
in their mind, the highest priority

942
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:02,200
is who can beat this president.

943
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,320
- Money may not matter, but
the sign that you've got

944
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,200
this movement behind you could.

945
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,940
- It could, but I
disagree with the senator,

946
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:11,190
having gone through it a couple
years ago, money matters.

947
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,610
Because, what's going to happen is,

948
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:15,790
whoever emerges out of this will wind up

949
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:17,490
having a huge target on their back

950
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:18,600
when they start to do well,

951
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,190
and they have to have the money to answer.

952
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:23,810
If you don't have the money
to answer, you're gonna lose.

953
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:25,950
Because, I love all the characterization

954
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:28,440
of Iowa and New Hampshire
voters, especially early,

955
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,410
as being so discerning and they wanna come

956
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:31,560
and meet you in person.

957
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,200
They wanna meet everybody in person,

958
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,940
but they also watch what
comes in their mailbox

959
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:37,300
or what comes over the
TV, and guys like Alex

960
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,170
wouldn't have made the fortune he's made

961
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:41,540
over time if that didn't matter.

962
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,270
It does matter, the money will matter,

963
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:45,030
and Sanders will matter.

964
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:47,380
But it's a Republican dream that Sanders

965
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,801
could actually be the nominee.

966
00:37:48,801 --> 00:37:49,980
- Can I just jump in real quick and say

967
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,790
it is increasingly, the difference between

968
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:55,210
Democrats on Capitol
Hill and these Democrats

969
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:57,960
jumping in to 2020 are
becoming increasingly glaring.

970
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,720
When you see all these
candidates supporting

971
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:03,400
Medicare for all, the Green
New Deal, free college,

972
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,010
all these ideas, getting
corporate money out of politics.

973
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:08,910
On Capitol Hill, Nancy
Pelosi is keeping her arms--

974
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,330
- But she's holding the line against some

975
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,870
of her new members as well there.

976
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:13,200
- Well they're introducing ideas,

977
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,350
but they're not gonna be
voted on on the floor.

978
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:16,350
And there's a reason for that,

979
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:18,580
and that's because most
Democrats on the Hill

980
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,200
are afraid of these ideas, and they think

981
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,310
they go too far and they're gonna--

982
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:24,900
- In a presidential campaign,
politics will just swamp

983
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:28,120
public policy over the course
of the next 18 months or so.

984
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,000
- [Rachael] They're going
to have to be careful--

985
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,880
- Capitol Hill will be taking a back seat

986
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,713
to what's happening in--

987
00:38:31,713 --> 00:38:33,430
- It shows in the divide
in the party, though.

988
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:35,780
- President Trump loves
the idea of Bernie Sanders

989
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,613
front and center.

990
00:38:36,613 --> 00:38:38,849
- Oh, he couldn't be that
lucky again could he?

991
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:41,290
Look, the president has
seen a Democratic party

992
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:44,510
going as crazy far left as Republicans

993
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:48,180
did far right under
Obama, and it's a gift.

994
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,546
Socialism didn't work for the Pilgrims.

995
00:38:50,546 --> 00:38:53,350
The first two years, half of them died,

996
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:55,762
and now that's the
Democratic party agenda.

997
00:38:55,762 --> 00:38:58,790
There are three Democratic
primaries to take on Trump,

998
00:38:58,790 --> 00:38:59,870
and all of them are gonna,

999
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:02,670
there's the Establishment
primary with Biden

1000
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:04,150
and Klobuchar--

1001
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,273
- [Patrick] Can't get more Socialist

1002
00:39:05,273 --> 00:39:06,443
than the Quakers, right?

1003
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,080
That was their model.

1004
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,340
- You're going to have
the Progressive primary

1005
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,890
which Sanders has the money and the lead.

1006
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:17,130
Then you've got Kamala
Harris and Cory Booker

1007
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:19,530
for the Obama Black primary.

1008
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:22,650
Which one, I think Kamala
Harris is gonna succeed

1009
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:24,420
in that one, you're
gonna see Bernie Sanders,

1010
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,550
maybe Klobuchar--
- Alex.

1011
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:28,847
- I would bet you right
now that Kamala Harris

1012
00:39:28,847 --> 00:39:30,806
can grow beyond, I think she's being,

1013
00:39:30,806 --> 00:39:32,537
she's a big enough candidate--

1014
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:34,610
- I'd be careful there,
there's no such thing

1015
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:36,370
as the Obama Black primary.

1016
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:38,540
- Yes, I think there is.
- I think Kamala Harris

1017
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:42,010
and Cory Booker are both
extraordinary candidates

1018
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:44,154
who can appeal to a broad cross section.

1019
00:39:44,154 --> 00:39:45,787
- That's my point about Kamala Harris.

1020
00:39:45,787 --> 00:39:48,567
I agree with that, and I
think that's right now--

1021
00:39:50,633 --> 00:39:54,080
- You're all judging the
Democratic party ideas

1022
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,760
by the people who are in now.

1023
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,470
What happens when Michael Bennett gets in?

1024
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:59,940
What happens when Sherrod Brown gets in?

1025
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:04,150
What happens when you
see Bloomberg get in?

1026
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,370
- What happens is they--

1027
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:06,203
- You mention Joe Biden,
you think he's getting in?

1028
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:07,036
- I do.

1029
00:40:07,036 --> 00:40:08,060
I think Joe will get in.

1030
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:10,740
I think the Vice president
will feel a calling

1031
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:13,600
will feel a necessity
to bring that gravitas

1032
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,300
and I think that the minute he gets in,

1033
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,530
he's going to be the
recognized front runner.

1034
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:18,868
- [Rachael] And there's an
opening for that right now.

1035
00:40:18,868 --> 00:40:20,750
- Joe Biden is hot, he has name ID,

1036
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,850
a lot of Democratic
voters are sitting there

1037
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:24,070
because they don't know the alternative

1038
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:26,420
but the soul of the
Democratic party is rabidly

1039
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:29,070
anti-Trump and it has gone crazy left.

1040
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:31,904
It belongs to Ocasio-Cortez,
not Joe Biden.

1041
00:40:31,904 --> 00:40:33,419
- The soul of the Democratic Party

1042
00:40:33,419 --> 00:40:37,012
- That is wishful Republican thinking.

1043
00:40:37,012 --> 00:40:40,698
- The soul of the Democratic
party, respectfully Alex,

1044
00:40:40,698 --> 00:40:43,310
there are folks who are sitting in Iowa,

1045
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:45,440
New Hampshire, South Carolina,

1046
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,060
California which is an
early state on Super Tuesday

1047
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,770
this time who are worried
about the education

1048
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:53,590
of their children, they're
concerned about health care.

1049
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:55,253
- Which is why Elizabeth Warren--

1050
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:57,183
- They're terribly concerned
about some of the corruption

1051
00:40:57,183 --> 00:40:58,629
we have in Washington, DC.

1052
00:40:58,629 --> 00:40:59,811
- Is for reparations.

1053
00:40:59,811 --> 00:41:00,865
- At the end of the day, here's the issue.

1054
00:41:00,865 --> 00:41:01,698
We're gonna dominate,

1055
00:41:01,698 --> 00:41:04,871
we're gonna move away
from politics of ideas

1056
00:41:04,871 --> 00:41:06,550
- Let's get to what's practical here.

1057
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:08,400
Let's get to what's practical here.

1058
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,600
And what campaigns come
down to are candidates.

1059
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,390
Forget about all the
ideology and everything else,

1060
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:14,570
it comes down to candidates.
- Who's gonna perform?

1061
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:15,640
- Who's gonna perform?

1062
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,070
You've seen this, I've seen this,

1063
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:17,903
I've lived it.

1064
00:41:17,903 --> 00:41:19,460
Who's going to get up there and perform?

1065
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:22,720
Kamala Harria, you know
learned this in her first week,

1066
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,430
when she's talking smoking
pot listening to Tupac,

1067
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:27,000
when Tupac's albums hadn't come out

1068
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,430
until six years after she
said she was in college.

1069
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:31,560
You're shaking your head,
Patrick, but let me tell you.

1070
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,480
She's probably told that
BS story in California

1071
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,180
a thousand times and no
one ever called her on it.

1072
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,760
When you run for president--
- But Governor--

1073
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,440
- They call you on everything.

1074
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,420
Who's going to perform
when the, there's only

1075
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,839
two alternatives, George.

1076
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:45,154
- We're going to judge them by whether

1077
00:41:45,154 --> 00:41:46,246
they tell the truth now?

1078
00:41:46,246 --> 00:41:47,777
(laughs)

1079
00:41:47,777 --> 00:41:49,935
that's a new standard for president!

1080
00:41:49,935 --> 00:41:52,140
- The Governor is saying
something terribly important.

1081
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:56,120
- When the lights go on,
there's only two alternatives.

1082
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,180
You either shine or you melt.

1083
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,410
Those are the only two alternatives

1084
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:01,540
for presidential candidates
and we're gonna see

1085
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,540
who does what, and I
think it's way too early

1086
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,160
to try to figure it out with these folks.

1087
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,990
And when Joe Biden is
seen as the front runner,

1088
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:10,141
which I think he is if he gets in,

1089
00:42:10,141 --> 00:42:13,660
this is a guy who's run twice
and hasn't exactly shined

1090
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:14,970
both times he ran.

1091
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:16,350
- Governor, you know a thing or two about

1092
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:18,270
fanciful tales and that type of thing.

1093
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:20,670
- [Chris] Aw, Patrick.

1094
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:22,250
- At the end of the day,
the Governor is right

1095
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:25,110
that this really is about performance.

1096
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:27,680
When you showed that clip at
the very beginning, George,

1097
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,500
every candidate with the
exception of Amy Klobuchar

1098
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,300
started each sentence with I.

1099
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:35,060
I believe, I feel, they understand

1100
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,560
that at the end of the
day, it's whether or not

1101
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,680
people can trust them and
their values and their story.

1102
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,430
- Rachael, one of the things
we've been seeing is that,

1103
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:43,586
since the government shut
down, the president's

1104
00:42:43,586 --> 00:42:45,770
actually had something of a
come back in recent weeks.

1105
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:48,550
Approval ratings back up,
heading towards the mid-40,

1106
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:50,550
not quite there yet, but this whole idea

1107
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:51,670
of the emergency going to back

1108
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:53,690
front and center on
Capitol Hill this week.

1109
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:55,340
- No, exactly, I mean
the president thinks that

1110
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:58,370
this is a good re-election,
something he can run on.

1111
00:42:58,370 --> 00:42:59,950
That it's gonna help him.

1112
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:01,910
And, you know it shows that he's obviously

1113
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:04,570
catering to his base,
and he's showing that he

1114
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:05,690
is putting them front and center,

1115
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:07,780
but it's interesting
because, in doing that,

1116
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:10,760
he has sort of upended the
re-elections potentially

1117
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,160
of other Senate Republicans.

1118
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,977
There are 22 Senate Republicans.

1119
00:43:13,977 --> 00:43:14,810
- They don't want this vote.
- They don't!

1120
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:16,470
and a lot of them were privately

1121
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:18,130
telling the president
please don't do this.

1122
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:20,060
Don't do this, this is
gonna create a terrible

1123
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:23,013
precedent if we have a President
Bernie Sanders some day,

1124
00:43:23,013 --> 00:43:26,150
if he's gonna try to do
something with the Green New Deal

1125
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:28,680
on his own, call it an
emergency, this a big problem.

1126
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:29,530
And we can't have that.

1127
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:31,340
But we're already seeing a lot of

1128
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:33,990
those same Republicans who privately

1129
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:36,820
were telling him don't do
this, come out and say that

1130
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:38,930
basically they're not going
to push back against him.

1131
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:41,040
- Still his Republican
party, and by the way,

1132
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,110
if the election were held today

1133
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:45,160
against the Democratic
party he's running against,

1134
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:49,452
I think Donald Trump will win
by more than he won last time.

1135
00:43:49,452 --> 00:43:52,190
The Democratic Party is going crazy left.

1136
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:53,540
The only thing that has changed,

1137
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,000
neither party has changed by the way,

1138
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,320
Republicans or Democrats
since Trump was elected,

1139
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:00,240
except Trump is now not theory, he's fact.

1140
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,766
And it's an impressive record--

1141
00:44:01,766 --> 00:44:03,069
- [Patrick} It's a fact
that the mid-term Elections

1142
00:44:03,069 --> 00:44:04,600
- Growth and security, excuse me--

1143
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,647
- Were a creation of that fact.

1144
00:44:06,647 --> 00:44:07,850
- But see, that's the thing--

1145
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:08,930
- You can't forget that happened.

1146
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:10,319
- No, that's important, but actually--

1147
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:12,936
- Where suburban white men in particular

1148
00:44:12,936 --> 00:44:14,787
have been fleeing from this president

1149
00:44:14,787 --> 00:44:15,740
- What you have to
understan, mid-terms are

1150
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:17,610
a referendum on the incumbent.

1151
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:20,440
Presidential years are
choices, and the Democrats

1152
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,670
are offering a choice of going left,

1153
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:23,630
Trump is saying--

1154
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:25,090
- The Democratic choice is not yet--

1155
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:27,008
- The economy is growing, I'm locking--

1156
00:44:27,008 --> 00:44:28,130
- The Democratic choice is not clarified,

1157
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:30,070
that's why you have the
primary contests, Alex.

1158
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:33,040
- Let me just say Trump's choice is clear.

1159
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,750
Growth and locking the
doors at night and security.

1160
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:38,470
The Democrat's response has
not been about either of those.

1161
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:40,700
It's only been about the mommy bear party,

1162
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,530
caregiving and nourishing.

1163
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:45,840
It's like a 1950s sitcom and in that case,

1164
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:48,864
the teddy bear party usually
beats the mommy bear party.

1165
00:44:48,864 --> 00:44:50,656
- So health care, child care-

1166
00:44:50,656 --> 00:44:52,555
- I'm not advocating,
I'm just telling you,

1167
00:44:52,555 --> 00:44:54,457
Trump has got a very strong hand going.

1168
00:44:54,457 --> 00:44:58,470
- If you think the economy in a year

1169
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:01,170
is gonna look like the
economy today, you're wrong.

1170
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:05,310
And the tax refund issue
is real, I know this.

1171
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:07,059
You can say well their taxes were reduced.

1172
00:45:07,059 --> 00:45:09,160
People count on that refund,

1173
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,120
and now they feel they got shortchanged.

1174
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,870
They look at economic
and business investment

1175
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:15,563
that never materialized.

1176
00:45:16,865 --> 00:45:18,800
They look at a package,
the signature piece,

1177
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,260
economic piece for this president--

1178
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:22,164
- Hoping for bad news is not
a great political strategy.

1179
00:45:22,164 --> 00:45:23,050
- No, no, and I'm not hoping for bad news.

1180
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:26,375
But I think bad news is
predictable in this cycle.

1181
00:45:26,375 --> 00:45:28,820
I mean I'm not the only
person saying this.

1182
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:30,513
I think look at one of the leading--

1183
00:45:30,513 --> 00:45:31,346
- [Alex] It is if you're a socialist.

1184
00:45:31,346 --> 00:45:34,090
- Indicators in the
economy is agriculture.

1185
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:36,223
We have record bankruptcies
in the farming industry.

1186
00:45:36,223 --> 00:45:40,170
- Alex is counting on that
socialism label sticking,

1187
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:42,040
but Chris, I wanna bring
up a different point

1188
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,170
inside the Republican party.

1189
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:45,160
It does seem to be
Trump's Republican party.

1190
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,950
Right now, we have Bill Weld say that

1191
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:48,237
he's going to run against him.

1192
00:45:48,237 --> 00:45:49,070
Larry Hogan, Governor of Maryland,

1193
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:50,230
had this to say this week.

1194
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:55,090
- I was just sworn in a
month ago for my second term.

1195
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:56,960
I've got a lot of work
to do here in Maryland.

1196
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,760
I would say I'm being
approached from a lot of

1197
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:02,200
different people, and I guess
the best way to put it is,

1198
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:05,070
I haven't thrown them out of my office.

1199
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:06,600
- How real is this idea of a significant

1200
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:07,520
challenge to the president?

1201
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,060
- Not, not real.

1202
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,470
Listen, there's probably
nobody in American politics

1203
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:13,330
who knows Larry Hogan better than I do

1204
00:46:13,330 --> 00:46:14,707
because I was the guy who I in 2014

1205
00:46:14,707 --> 00:46:17,160
went in there when no one
thought Maryland was winnable

1206
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,410
and I invested $2 million in Larry Hogan,

1207
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:20,930
and we got him over the finish line.

1208
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:23,300
Larry Hogan won both times,

1209
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:25,570
only the second Republican
ever to be re-elected

1210
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:27,820
Governor of Maryland in
the history of the state

1211
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:29,240
because he's a smart politician.

1212
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:32,590
And a smart politician is not,
based on this set of facts,

1213
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:34,720
gonna challenge Donald Trump in a primary.

1214
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,410
Because the guy's got 80%

1215
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:38,160
approval ratings among Republicans.

1216
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,160
And so I think what Larry's
doing is he's got some issues

1217
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,350
he cares about, he's gonna
use this as a platform

1218
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:45,170
to speak out about those issues, to try to

1219
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:47,690
bring the party a little bit
back towards where he is,

1220
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:50,420
but the idea that Larry Hogan,
and Bill Weld's not serious,

1221
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:51,594
no one takes Bill Weld seriously,

1222
00:46:51,594 --> 00:46:53,910
Larry Hogan would be
serious, but he's not.

1223
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:55,810
My view is, he's not gonna do it.

1224
00:46:55,810 --> 00:46:58,450
- It seems like it would
be, it's political suicide

1225
00:46:58,450 --> 00:46:59,283
to do that right now.

1226
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:02,110
I mean this is Donald Trump's
party still, two years later.

1227
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:04,521
Look no further again to the
National Emergency Declaration.

1228
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:05,530
- [Patrick] Provided
there isn't a revelation

1229
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:06,420
that comes out of these investigatons--

1230
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:08,760
- Then by the way, Larry
Hogan would be with

1231
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,602
a whole group of people who
were running if that happened.

1232
00:47:10,602 --> 00:47:11,780
- Republicans were out
speaking against this

1233
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:13,970
Emergency Declaration for weeks.

1234
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:16,400
He totally ignored them and
now they're backing off.

1235
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,876
This is Trump's party and
running against him is foolish.

1236
00:47:18,876 --> 00:47:19,940
- The question is what
does happen with these

1237
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:21,660
farther on investigations
throughout Mueller?

1238
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:24,440
We still haven't Robert
Mueller's report either, Senator.

1239
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,650
Do you sense any concern among your former

1240
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:28,970
colleagues on Capitol Hill
that if Robert Mueller

1241
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:32,293
finishes his job and hands it off to them

1242
00:47:32,293 --> 00:47:35,340
that they're going to be
wary of going too far?

1243
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:37,130
- I hope so, I think they are.

1244
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:39,930
I think they realize that
one of the worst things

1245
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:42,330
that can happen, in my
opinion, is impeachment.

1246
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:44,720
I think that you have
to win at the ballot box

1247
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:49,720
in order to have a real
future for this country.

1248
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:51,140
- [George] Does that
mean no investigating?

1249
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:52,720
- No, it doesn't mean no investigating,

1250
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,200
but it does mean that what do you do

1251
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,660
with that investigation?

1252
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:58,280
All of that information is
critical, it's important.

1253
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,965
The public needs to know.

1254
00:47:59,965 --> 00:48:02,960
I said 20% of the public, guess what?

1255
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,800
They believe whatever the president says.

1256
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,110
The next 20% will look at this and say

1257
00:48:07,110 --> 00:48:09,637
yeah, he doesn't always
tell the truth but so what?

1258
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:13,180
I mean so you've got 40% who
aren't really gonna ever care.

1259
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:16,150
You're looking at the 20% that
you hope you could persuade.

1260
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:17,080
- That's what the polls say now.

1261
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,600
The past is prologue, senator.

1262
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:21,460
I remember the polling a year before

1263
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:24,446
President Nixon resigned
said that 50% of Americans

1264
00:48:24,446 --> 00:48:25,710
thought that too much media attention was

1265
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:27,190
being paid to Watergate.

1266
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:28,900
The polling on the day that he resigned

1267
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:31,500
said a quarter of Americans
still supported Richard Nixon.

1268
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,190
So I just, I think that you--

1269
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:34,660
- [George] You're full speed ahead?

1270
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:37,230
- I think Democrats in
Congress are absolutely

1271
00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:39,059
going to continue these investigations.

1272
00:48:39,059 --> 00:48:41,600
There's more than enough
fodder when you consider

1273
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:44,530
that every institution that
Donald Trump has touched

1274
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:47,230
has come into being questioned from

1275
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:49,523
his cabinet picks like his
current Labor Secretary

1276
00:48:49,523 --> 00:48:51,980
to his foundation that he had to shutter.

1277
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:54,283
- Here's the thing, though, it that

1278
00:48:54,283 --> 00:48:57,270
there better be some there there.

1279
00:48:57,270 --> 00:48:59,328
If they're going to decide
to go down that road,

1280
00:48:59,328 --> 00:49:01,436
- Mountains of there.

1281
00:49:01,436 --> 00:49:03,579
- Patrick, this is a
different context now.

1282
00:49:03,579 --> 00:49:05,460
Because when you're
getting into a presidential

1283
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:08,020
election cycle, people
are going to see it as not

1284
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:10,960
being necessarily legitimate,
but being political.

1285
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,640
Even more political when you're gonna have

1286
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,319
all these candidates
that they're not going

1287
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:15,322
to be able to control themselves.

1288
00:49:15,322 --> 00:49:16,420
- How does that affect
your former colleagues

1289
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:18,190
in the Southern District
right now who seem to have

1290
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:19,700
the most serious investigation
in the Trump investigation?

1291
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:21,950
- Not a lick, not a bit.

1292
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:22,783
They don't care.

1293
00:49:22,783 --> 00:49:25,390
That's why we were, when I
was US Attorney of New Jersey,

1294
00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:27,090
every other U.S. Attorney
used to refer to them

1295
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:28,940
as the Sovereign District of New York.

1296
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:31,280
They believe they are a
sovereign power unto themselves

1297
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,360
in the Southern District.

1298
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:33,953
They'll listen to no one.

1299
00:49:33,953 --> 00:49:35,160
They barely listen to
the Attorney General.

1300
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:37,591
So they're going to do whatever
they think they need to do,

1301
00:49:37,591 --> 00:49:39,120
and that's what I've
been saying as you know,

1302
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:42,180
for 10 months here, the
Southern District of New York

1303
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:46,880
investigation is monumentally
more perilous to the president

1304
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,400
that Bob Mueller ever was or ever will be.

1305
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,280
They have two tour guides, George,

1306
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,330
and no restriction on where they can go.

1307
00:49:53,330 --> 00:49:54,370
- That is the last word today.

1308
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:55,260
Thank you all very much.

1309
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:56,980
Up next, our experts
break down what to expect

1310
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:59,190
from President Trump's
second nuclear summit

1311
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:00,660
with North Korea's Kim Jong-un.

1312
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:01,660
We'll be right back.

1313
00:50:03,988 --> 00:50:06,988
(suspenseful music)

1314
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:11,320
- As of today, we are all
officially working together.

1315
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,490
- As a team.

1316
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:13,520
- [Both] Led by me.

1317
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,377

♪ Warrior ♪

1319
00:50:16,867 --> 00:50:18,710
- How about a warning next time?

1320
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:19,863
- Okay, we're here.

1321
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:22,040
- I am going to win you over.

1322
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:23,120
My charm is like a virus.

1323
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,390
Before you know it, boom, you're infected.

1324
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:27,640
- So you're going to give me a virus?

1325
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:30,030
- [Narrator] Whiskey Cavalier,

1327
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:37,240
- [Narrator] Hey Mercedes,

1328

Mercedes Benz, the best or nothing.

1332
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:51,220
- [Narrator] This is what she sees.

1333
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:53,260
This is what's really there.

1334
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:56,888
Is it possible to avoid hitting
something you can't see?

1335
00:50:56,888 --> 00:50:58,500
Seven on your side
investigates the dangers

1336
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:01,260
of front over crashes
tonight after the Oscars

1337

and Monday on ABC 7 News at six.

1338
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:09,670
- They have to get rid of
all their nuclear weapons.

1339
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:11,830
- They've got to get rid
of, yeah, I think they will.

1340
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:13,330
I really believe that he will.

1341
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:15,083
I've gotten to know him over--

1342
00:51:15,083 --> 00:51:16,240
- Did he tell you that?
- A short period of time,

1343
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,300
yeah sure it's de-nuking.

1344
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:20,690
I mean, he's de-nuking the whole place,

1345
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:21,950
and he's gonna start very quickly.

1346
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:23,260
I think he's gonna start now.

1347
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:26,755
I'd just like to see
ultimately denuclearization

1348
00:51:26,755 --> 00:51:29,372
of North Korea, and I think
we will see that ultimately.

1349
00:51:29,372 --> 00:51:32,383
I have no pressing time schedule.

1350
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:35,220
- President Trump resetting
expectations there

1351
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:37,100
for his second nuclear
summit with North Korea,

1352
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:38,900
that's set for Thursday in Vietnam.

1353
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:40,700
Let's talk about the risk
and the possible rewards

1354
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:42,380
of that meeting with our panel of experts,

1355
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:44,850
Tom Bossert, former Trump
Homeland Security Adviser,

1356
00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:46,160
ABC News contributor.

1357
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,670
Jung Pak, Brookings Institution
Korea Studies Chair,

1358
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:50,090
former CIA Analyst.

1359
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:52,150
And Bill Richardson, former
U.S. Ambassador to the U.N.

1360
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:53,570
Who has negotiated with North Korea.

1361
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:55,267
Ambassador Richardson,
let me begin with you.

1362
00:51:55,267 --> 00:51:57,310
You saw the president resetting
the expectations there.

1363
00:51:57,310 --> 00:51:59,110
He also has a tweet out
this morning that ends

1364
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:01,060
with denuclearization
with a question mark,

1365
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:03,060
questioning whether that's gonna happen.

1366
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:07,100
Can you have a successful
summit without a clear

1367
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:09,370
commitment by the North Koreans and actual

1368
00:52:09,370 --> 00:52:11,945
concrete action to denuclearize?

1369
00:52:11,945 --> 00:52:14,820
- I don't believe it would
be a successful summit

1370
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:18,210
unless you had some kind of
commitment on North Korea's

1371
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:22,380
part on denuclearization,
dismantling, inspections,

1372
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:25,410
missiles, nuclear detonations.

1373
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:29,670
It seems a president
deflating expectations,

1374
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:31,270
and that's a concern.

1375
00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:33,420
The concern 'cause I
think what should come out

1376
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:36,310
of this summit is a
framework for negotiations.

1377
00:52:36,310 --> 00:52:39,140
My worry, George, is
that this negotiation,

1378
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:44,140
this summit may be a dud, that
instead of concrete progress

1379
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:47,600
on what is important,
denuclearization, it's now shifting

1380
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:52,460
from denuclearization,
arms control, to peace,

1381
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:57,420
to important steps, return of
our servicemen, the remains.

1382
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:02,420
Maybe a liaison office,
maybe some kind of continued

1383
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:06,460
North South cooperation, which is good.

1384
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:10,370
I think the president deserves
credit for lowering tensions

1385
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:14,030
in the region, but in terms
of concrete accomplishments,

1386
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:16,460
I don't think this summit's
gonna produce that.

1387
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:17,730
- Dud is, I guess, one possibility.

1388
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:19,740
There's also been some concern
expressed by the president's

1389
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:21,260
advisors that he gives away something that

1390
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:23,080
he shouldn't give away too soon,

1391
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:26,020
say a formal peace declaration,
a formal declaration

1392
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:28,260
end to the Korean War.

1393
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:29,410
- I think Bill is right.

1394
00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:33,160
I think there's been a profound
shift in talking about peace

1395
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,970
and normalization with North Korea

1396
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:36,330
rather than the nuclear issues.

1397
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:37,660
And I think that's really problematic

1398
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:40,830
because the whole point of a
summit between the two leaders,

1399
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:45,350
is to get dismantlement
and to get North Korea

1400
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:47,910
to completely abandon
it's nuclear weapons.

1401
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:50,320
I think having a peace
declaration and normalization

1402
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,187
is fine for tension reduction,

1403
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:54,448
but we really have to wonder about how

1404
00:53:54,448 --> 00:53:57,172
that affects North Korea's
actions down the line.

1405
00:53:57,172 --> 00:53:58,452
- Should there be, Tom Bossert,

1406
00:53:58,452 --> 00:54:00,110
should there be a summit
now given the fact that

1407
00:54:00,110 --> 00:54:02,380
the president's own
National Security Advisor,

1408
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:05,820
John Bolton says that North
Korea hasn't followed through

1409
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:07,240
on the commitments they
made at the first summit.

1410
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:09,510
- There's been
back-pedaling and dishonesty

1411
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:11,860
from the last summit
which was a significant

1412
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:13,780
watershed moment 'til today.

1413
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:15,910
At this point, the only
reason to have that summit

1414
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:17,660
is for President Trump to go in

1415
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:19,210
and give a clear-eyed reminder.

1416
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:21,500
It will be a dud if he comes out and tries

1417
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,486
to varnish this as a success without

1418
00:54:23,486 --> 00:54:26,290
any real actionable activity.

1419
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:29,260
Any kind of freeze or reversible gesture,

1420
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:31,629
superficial gesture on the
part of the North Koreans,

1421
00:54:31,629 --> 00:54:34,040
is gonna be a little bit
of a slap in the face,

1422
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:36,100
but if the president then
comes out and buys it,

1423
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:38,210
whether it's because of
domestic political pressure

1424
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:40,680
or some other instinct to post a win,

1425
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:43,960
he's going to lose the
international coalition

1426
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,557
that he's put together and
the strength he goes in with.

1427
00:54:45,557 --> 00:54:47,230
- The president had
another tweet this morning,

1428
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:49,055
Jung Pak, that the president put out,

1429
00:54:49,055 --> 00:54:51,360
he says that North Korea can
be an economic powerhouse

1430
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:53,510
under Kim Jong-un if they just give up

1431
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:54,343
their nuclear weapons.

1432
00:54:54,343 --> 00:54:57,620
Almost trying to incentivize
him to come further along.

1433
00:54:57,620 --> 00:54:59,930
At this point, he does seem to be banking

1434
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:02,360
on the idea that his personal relationship

1435
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:04,930
with Kim Jong-un is somehow
gonna yield benefits.

1436
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:08,730
- Yeah, I think President
Trump is making the mistake

1437
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:12,670
of mirror imaging, so the
president is from New York City.

1438
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:15,340
He's a business man and
a real estate mogul,

1439
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:18,320
and he's speaking in terms
of as if Kim is another

1440
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,440
business man, but Kim is a dictator

1441
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:24,520
of a highly authoritarian regime,

1442
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:26,990
who needs his nuclear
weapons for legitimacy

1443
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,260
and his own survival.

1444
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:30,900
And so yes, North Korea is in the middle

1445
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,530
of a very strategic environment

1446
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:35,360
among the second, third, and 11th largest

1447
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:36,720
economies in the world.

1448
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:39,770
But North Korea also sees its location

1449
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:42,100
and its economic deprivation

1450
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:44,920
relative to the other
countries as a threat

1451
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:45,753
to it's survival.

1452
00:55:45,753 --> 00:55:48,293
- So how do we make progress short of

1453
00:55:48,293 --> 00:55:51,100
North Korea getting rid
of it's nuclear weapons?

1454
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:52,360
The testing moratorium, we've seen

1455
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:54,170
testing moratoriums in the past.

1456
00:55:54,170 --> 00:55:58,160
What kind of concrete action
could we see from North Korea

1457
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,590
that would really signify

1458
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:01,540
real progress that can be built on?

1459
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:04,170
- I think Jung is right and so is Tom.

1460
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:06,680
My view is that, what
is concrete progress?

1461
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:09,400
One, I've called this a potential dud,

1462
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:12,579
but we've got to continue
talking the relationship--

1463
00:56:12,579 --> 00:56:14,200
- There's no harm.
- No.

1464
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:18,030
The relationship of the
two leaders, that's good.

1465
00:56:18,030 --> 00:56:21,160
However, the president should
listen to his advisors,

1466
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:26,160
and his advisors have been,
I think, very specific.

1467
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:28,900
What I fear we're gonna lose, one,

1468
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:31,880
a detailing of all the weapons inventory

1469
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,480
that North Korea has.

1470
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,690
I think we've kind of given up on that.

1471
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:39,340
Secondly, that we simply say okay,

1472
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:43,420
you dismantle the Yongbyon
reactor, another missile site,

1473
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:46,450
that they've already done several times.

1474
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:49,840
That's a danger, and if
that's the only arms control

1475
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,780
initiative that they push.

1476
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:55,140
I think lastly, my worry,
George, is that we're gonna trade

1477
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:56,560
something what the North Koreans

1478
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:59,800
really want which is a peace treaty

1479
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:03,620
in exchange for some limited
arms control measures.

1480
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:06,960
I think what needs to happen
is dismantle some weapons.

1481
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,950
They're not going to
dismantle all of them.

1482
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:11,230
Freeze intercontinental ballistic missiles

1483
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:13,690
that affect Japan and South Korea.

1484
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:17,705
Find ways that these are concrete steps.

1485
00:57:17,705 --> 00:57:22,705
Timelines, verification, a
framework for negotiations.

1486
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:25,230
If it's just a bunch of hand shakes,

1487
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:28,160
and you're a good guy, we'll meet again,

1488
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,510
it's gonna be a dud.

1489
00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:30,950
- Is there a win win here?

1490
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:33,080
- Yeah, but it's not going to
happen out of this meeting.

1491
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:35,400
So what happened in the
last meeting took us back

1492
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,620
from the brink of war, but the president,

1493
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:38,720
two presidents agreed

1494
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:42,520
to two mutually inconsistent
future objectives.

1495
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:44,660
One was normalization
between the North and South,

1496
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:47,390
and the other was
denuclearization of the North.

1497
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:49,700
Right now, president Moon in the South

1498
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:52,370
is suggesting that he give some incentives

1499
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:54,310
in terms of money or
reductions in sanctions

1500
00:57:54,310 --> 00:57:57,040
or opening up industrial
complexes to the North

1501
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,150
to induce them into further talks,

1502
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:00,840
to re-normalize their relationships.

1503
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:03,100
That would fundamentally
undermine everything

1504
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:04,740
that President Trump is trying to do

1505
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:06,460
with respect to denuclearizing.

1506
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:09,130
If you don't force him, to Jung's point,

1507
00:58:09,130 --> 00:58:11,030
the North will not get
rid of their weapons.

1508
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:13,250
So the win win here has
to be for the president

1509
00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:16,420
to carry the international
good will to this meeting

1510
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:18,370
because he's not representing
the United States

1511
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:19,840
and come out of this with some serious,

1512
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,760
if not threatening additional sanctions.

1513
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,770
- That is the last word for
today, thank you all very much.

1514
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:24,820
