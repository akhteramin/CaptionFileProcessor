(triumphant music)

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,170
- Good evening, I'm Judy Woodruff.

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:20,210
On the NewsHour tonight, A House Divided.

7
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,130
President Trump delivers his
State of the Union address

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,989
after the longest government shutdown

9
00:00:24,989 --> 00:00:27,210
and no deal yet in sight for a

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,340
barrier at the southern border.

11
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,010
We talk with lawmakers.

12
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:34,229
Historian Michael Beschloss
puts the address in context,

13
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:37,840
and our panel previews what
is at stake for the President.

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,430
Plus, Mr. Trump's plan
to keep forces in Iraq

15
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:45,200
to monitor Iran sparked
condemnation in Baghdad

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,670
and calls for the U.S. to leave.

17
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,073
All that and more on
tonight's PBS NewsHour.

(uplifting music)

51
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,860
- This is State of the Union night,

52
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,940
when the President makes an annual report

53
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,490
to the American people,
but it comes at a time

54
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,440
of division here in Washington.

55
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,540
The White House says President
Trump will appeal for unity

56
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,980
even as he holds to his
demand for a border wall.

57
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,750
Newly resurgent Democrats say

58
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,110
the President himself is the problem.

59
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,620
The split was clear at the Capitol today

60
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,352
as Mr. Trump's supporters
and opponents sounded off.

61
00:02:53,352 --> 00:02:55,057
- I think he's doing a good job,

62
00:02:55,057 --> 00:02:56,880
and I think he really is making an effort.

63
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,330
He'll make some statements tonight

64
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:01,860
that'll surprise a lot of
people on the other side.

65
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,820
I'm talking about conciliatory things

66
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,670
and I think this comes from the heart.

67
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:09,370
This guy is, he has a background that has

68
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,980
shown him in different lights

69
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,320
but it's always been successful.

70
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,910
- Well, the President
hasn't been acting on unity

71
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,450
for two years up and down the line.

72
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,520
He's always criticizing, dividing,

73
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:27,520
and so if he calls for unity
tonight, we'll have to say,

74
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,070
let's see what happens tomorrow

75
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,400
and the day after and the day after,

76
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,450
because in the past he's called for unity

77
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,190
and he's forgotten about
it by the next morning.

78
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,330
- The formal Democratic response tonight

79
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,960
will come from Stacey Abrams of Georgia.

80
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,100
She narrowly lost her bid last year

81
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,700
to become that state's
first Black governor

82
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,789
and she's now a rising star
in the Democratic Party.

83
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:51,940
Let's turn now to our Lisa
Desjardins at the Capitol

84
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,380
and Yamiche Alcindor at the White House

85
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,080
watching all of this.

86
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,470
Yamiche, to you first.

87
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,880
I've been talking to
folks at the White House,

88
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,780
much of it off the record.

89
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,410
You've been talking to them too.

90
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,618
What do we know for certain,

91
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:07,180
or what do we think the
President's gonna focus on tonight?

92
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,180
- The President's gonna
focus on unifying our nation

93
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,940
and unifying both political parties,

94
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,290
but some of course say that there's some

95
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,030
credibility issues there because of

96
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,510
his political track record of really

97
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:21,700
offending and giving insults
to his political opponents.

98
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,280
The President is expected to talk about

99
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,808
a number of topics including
illegal immigration,

100
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:28,480
health care costs, including trade,

101
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,700
wars and foreign policy,
as well as infrastructure.

102
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,000
He's supposed to be, at some point,

103
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,200
pitching and asking Congress to come up

104
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,800
with some sort of infrastructure plan.

105
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,360
The President's also
supposed to be talking about

106
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,730
HIV and trying to end the transmission of

107
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:43,400
that deadly disease by 2030,

108
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,930
and the President is also
supposed to be talking about

109
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,560
his ideas for a way forward,

110
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,640
and it's really important
though to remind people

111
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,850
that the President has been tweeting today

112
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,700
and he's been saying
that Chuck Schumer's mad

113
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,910
that he didn't win the Senate.

114
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,090
He's also said in the past that

115
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,230
Democrats don't believe
in border security,

116
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,740
so while the President puts
forward this unifying message,

117
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,790
there are people who are saying,

118
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,560
well, just look at what you tweeted today.

119
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,050
That's gonna be hurting
that unifying message.

120
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,440
- And Lisa, we know that the other party

121
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,840
always prepares for what
the President's gonna say.

122
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,130
What are Democrats saying
about how they plan to handle,

123
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,540
what they expect the President to say

124
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,230
and how they're gonna respond to it?

125
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,210
- I have to tell you, Judy,

126
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,420
Democrats are more excited
about this response

127
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,290
than I've heard them in some time.

128
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,400
Stacey Abrams, to them, represents a

129
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,510
shift away from playing it safe.

130
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,540
In fact, there's one long-time

131
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,008
progressive who told me tonight,

132
00:05:29,008 --> 00:05:31,310
we've been playing it
too safe as Democrats.

133
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:35,320
We want someone who has a
clear, aggressive agenda

134
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,010
like Stacey Abrams, who
talks about voter rights.

135
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,230
She also represents some other

136
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,820
important themes for Democrats tonight.

137
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,220
Diversity, in two ways.

138
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,660
One, she will be the first
African-American woman

139
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,630
to give a major party response.

140
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,830
Also, though, she will be the
first non-elected official.

141
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,240
She no longer holds office,

142
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,540
having lost the
gubernatorial race last fall.

143
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,160
She'll be the first non-elected official

144
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,970
to give this kind of response,
so a sort of outsider

145
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:01,410
and also a core part
of the Democratic base.

146
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,140
This also speaks to a theme

147
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,660
that we'll see visually
on the floor, Judy.

148
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,370
Democratic women in the House
will be wearing all white.

149
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,250
They say that is to show kind of a sign,

150
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,760
reference to the suffragettes,

151
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,880
but it also, one of them told
me, is a smart visual cue.

152
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,520
They want to highlight the difference

153
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,260
between Democrats and
their increased diversity

154
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,190
in this Congress, and Republicans who have

155
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,810
less diversity this Congress.

156
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,071
- And Lisa, staying with you,

157
00:06:24,071 --> 00:06:26,480
Yamiche mentioned the
President is supposed

158
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,990
to talk tonight about border security.

159
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,550
What do we know at this point about

160
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,770
where the conference committee

161
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:35,230
working on that issue for
the last several days.

162
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,580
They have a deadline facing them.

163
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,880
I talked today to Speaker Pelosi

164
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,570
and Minority Leader Schumer,

165
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:43,540
they said they think
progress is being made.

166
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,560
What are you hearing?

167
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,310
- My reporting is the same.

168
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,220
Talking to other leaders
and people who are

169
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,580
on the conference committee,
there is real progress.

170
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,490
On the staff level, they think they could

171
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:53,711
come up with a deal if it is just left

172
00:06:53,711 --> 00:06:55,962
to the members of the
Appropriations Committee alone.

173
00:06:55,962 --> 00:06:58,120
Judy, the conference committee will have

174
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,332
an unusual meeting tomorrow morning,

175
00:07:00,332 --> 00:07:04,450
closed doors, with career
Border Patrol officials.

176
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,660
Now, it's not clear why
that's to be closed doors,

177
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,400
but one staffer told me
they think it's because

178
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,060
they want the questions and answers to be

179
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,424
as forthright as possible.

180
00:07:13,424 --> 00:07:16,900
They are looking at trying
to get a conference report

181
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,064
by the end of this week or
this weekend at the latest.

182
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:22,330
They think it's doable, but
there are many X-factors,

183
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:23,980
one of the biggest being the President

184
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,770
and what he says tonight
about border security.

185
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:29,500
- And finally, Yamiche,
what do we know about

186
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,700
how the President is planning for tonight,

187
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,334
and also traditionally the President

188
00:07:34,334 --> 00:07:36,383
has guests come to the Capitol.

189
00:07:36,383 --> 00:07:38,980
Who do we know those to be?

190
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,280
- Well, the President is going to be using

191
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,310
this national stage to make the case

192
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,370
that the state of the union is great,

193
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,387
but that it would be better
if there were concerns met

194
00:07:46,387 --> 00:07:48,540
and concerns, and people paid attention

195
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,940
to the concerns that he had.

196
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,060
Right behind me at the White House,

197
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,700
the President has been preparing

198
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,427
and really using this speech as a way to

199
00:07:55,427 --> 00:07:57,955
prepare himself to talk on a teleprompter.

200
00:07:57,955 --> 00:08:00,660
He had a teleprompter
actually brought into

201
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,060
the White House so he's gonna be trying to

202
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,570
make sure that he's reading properly.

203
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:04,860
The other thing that he's gonna be doing

204
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,999
is bringing in guests here.

205
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:07,479
The guests that he's bringing in are

206
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:09,960
one, a family that was,
whose family member

207
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,380
was murdered or killed by
an undocumented immigrant.

208
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,050
The President's also going to be bringing

209
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,720
a little boy named Joshua Trump

210
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,220
who was bullied because of his last name

211
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,130
who, of course, he shares
with the President,

212
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,260
and the President's also
going to be bringing

213
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:25,688
someone who was freed by the
Criminal Justice Reform Act

214
00:08:25,688 --> 00:08:28,040
that was passed by both
parties, of course,

215
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,190
supporting that bill, so the
President's gonna be saying,

216
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,120
we want bipartisanship
and look at this person

217
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,270
who came out of prison, he is embodying

218
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,551
what we could be doing in the future.

219
00:08:36,551 --> 00:08:38,690
- Yamiche Alcindor at the White House,

220
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,040
Lisa Desjardins at the Capitol,

221
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,270
and we'll certainly be
coming back to the two of you

222
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,649
as the State of the Union gets underway

223
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:46,450
later tonight when we
have our special coverage.

224
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:47,283
Thanks,

225
00:08:47,283 --> 00:08:49,780
and we wanna hear from lawmakers now.

226
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,300
Representative James
Clyburn of South Carolina

227
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,990
is the third highest ranking
Democrat in the U.S. House,

228
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,959
and he joins us from Capitol Hill.

229
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:01,560
Representative Clyburn, thank
you very much for joining us.

230
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,393
- Thank you.

231
00:09:02,393 --> 00:09:03,260
- Thank you.

232
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,919
What are you looking for
President Trump to say tonight?

233
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:09,871
- Well, the President is
asking us to choose greatness,

234
00:09:09,871 --> 00:09:14,850
and I would hope that we
hear some greatness from him,

235
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:18,359
but you know, I have been
reading a lot of Joyce,

236
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:22,320
of Alexis de Tocqueville of late,

237
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,560
and Alexis de Tocqueville,
in one of his writings,

238
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,050
Democracy in America, told us that

239
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:31,230
America's greatness is not because

240
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,770
we are more enlightened
than any other country,

241
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:39,190
but because we've always been
able to repair our faults.

242
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:42,060
I would hope that the President tonight

243
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,140
will demonstrate that kind of greatness,

244
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:50,140
propose some things that we
can do to repair our faults.

245
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,730
They have been highlighted quite a bit

246
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,620
in the last several
months, and I am hopeful

247
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,940
that whatever he says tonight
will bring us together

248
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:03,800
as a people, move us forward as a country,

249
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,050
and make us really the
genius of greatness.

250
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:10,080
- Well, where do you
see, Congressman Clyburn,

251
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,280
there could be common ground,

252
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,821
because what the White House says is,

253
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:15,160
we've tried to make overtures

254
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,749
to Democrats on border security.

255
00:10:17,749 --> 00:10:20,500
We haven't, they haven't
met eye to eye with us,

256
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,870
and they tick off a number of other issues

257
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,930
where they say Democrats haven't

258
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:26,340
been able to meet them halfway.

259
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:30,090
What do you, where do you
see potential common ground?

260
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,330
- Well, I think there's common ground

261
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:36,290
to be had on border security.

262
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,330
The President seems to have backed away

263
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:42,421
from his concrete 30-foot high wall

264
00:10:42,421 --> 00:10:47,410
and is now talking about
more border security,

265
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:49,270
he's talking about barriers,

266
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:54,270
and we too have backed
away from our positions

267
00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:00,170
of no money for any kind of wall.

268
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:02,850
We are advocating a smart wall,

269
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:07,850
using 21st century
technology to make this wall

270
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:12,760
as smart as we've made our
telephones and our televisions,

271
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:17,180
so we can have a smart wall,
one that would use drones

272
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:20,440
to keep anybody from flying over it,

273
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,170
use X-ray equipment to keep
anybody from getting around it,

274
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:26,190
use scanners to keep anybody

275
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,910
from burrowing under it undetected.

276
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:31,453
So we can do this in a smart way.

277
00:11:31,453 --> 00:11:35,040
I just came back from Brownsville, Texas.

278
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,350
We were at a port of entry,

279
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:42,350
and I saw a port in dire
need of retrofitting.

280
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:48,381
I saw the fencing that's already there

281
00:11:48,381 --> 00:11:51,130
in dire need of repairing.

282
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:54,540
I do believe that we can do

283
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,320
what is necessary to secure our border.

284
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,230
Just do it in a smart way,

285
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,140
not to build a monument to anybody.

286
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,860
- So to be clear, you're saying Democrats,

287
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,840
and obviously as we said,
you're third in line

288
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,240
in the leadership in the House,

289
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,410
the Democrats are prepared to support

290
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:14,735
the money for some sort
of physical barrier?

291
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:17,506
- I said so long as it's done smartly.

292
00:12:17,506 --> 00:12:19,730
I believe that we will vote for

293
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:22,430
whatever that committee comes out.

294
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:25,900
If they come out with
a bipartisan approach

295
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:30,470
to get this done, irrespective
of how they put it together,

296
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:34,060
I do believe you'll get extensive support

297
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,750
among Democrats for it.

298
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:39,420
It may not be unanimous,
but it'll be a lot of unity.

299
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,380
- Are Democrats prepared to show

300
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,010
respect to the President tonight?

301
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:47,330
I ask that because we remember
under President Obama,

302
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:49,241
there were State of the Union addresses

303
00:12:49,241 --> 00:12:52,330
when members called out to him,

304
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,191
once one of them calling him a liar.

305
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:57,280
How do you see tonight going?

306
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,360
- I think you'll see us
being very respectful.

307
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,360
You know, my dad used
to teach us all the time

308
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,080
that the first sign of a good education

309
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,670
is good manners and so I try to put

310
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:11,430
my education on display every time I walk

311
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:14,010
into the halls of the Congress,

312
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,780
or the House of Representatives.

313
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:19,680
You may remember, when that yell was made,

314
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,780
I'm the one that led the charge

315
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:25,060
to get a resolution of disapproval

316
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,898
for what my colleague said that night

317
00:13:27,898 --> 00:13:30,940
and it passed the House of Representatives

318
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,270
and I think that we showed then

319
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,340
that we disapprove of such actions

320
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,132
and we certainly are
not going to do anything

321
00:13:39,132 --> 00:13:42,750
to violate what we did last year.

322
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,859
- Congressman Clyburn, finally,

323
00:13:43,859 --> 00:13:48,073
what other areas do you see
Democrats and Republicans

324
00:13:48,073 --> 00:13:51,830
and the White House working
together on this year?

325
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,040
- Oh, I think that we can do

326
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,130
a comprehensive infrastructure deal.

327
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:59,140
I think we know that it's necessary

328
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,970
for us to develop our rural communities.

329
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:04,380
We need to be putting in water and sewage.

330
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,690
We need to be repairing roads and bridges.

331
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:10,470
We need to be building
schools in our rural areas.

332
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:15,470
We can do a comprehensive
bill that would have

333
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:19,320
broadband deployment going
into these rural communities.

334
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,430
Too many of them are being left behind.

335
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:23,300
We need to make this investment.

336
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,290
It will pay off handsomely if we do,

337
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:30,910
and I really believe it can
be done in a bipartisan way.

338
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:33,920
- Congressman James
Clyburn, who is the whip

339
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,900
for the Democrats in the
House of Representatives.

340
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,900
Thank you very much.

341
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,321
- Thank you.

342
00:14:38,321 --> 00:14:41,460
- And as we heard,
President Trump is expected

343
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,460
to double down in his speech tonight,

344
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,760
calling on Congress to fund a wall,

345
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,860
a barrier along the southern border.

346
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,802
One option he has not ruled out,

347
00:14:49,802 --> 00:14:53,280
declaring a national
emergency to build the wall.

348
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,280
That is causing a split
among Senate Republicans.

349
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,270
Senator Lindsey Graham warned yesterday

350
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:01,350
that there could be a war
within the GOP over the wall.

351
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,650
We turn now to one of the President's

352
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,520
most loyal allies in Congress.

353
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,550
He is Senator David Perdue of Georgia.

354
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:10,560
Senator, thank you very
much for joining us,

355
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,970
and I think you are there.

356
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:12,803
There you are.

357
00:15:12,803 --> 00:15:17,640
Senator, how much of a
divide is there still,

358
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,202
do you think, between
Republicans and Democrats,

359
00:15:20,202 --> 00:15:22,309
between Democrats and the White House

360
00:15:22,309 --> 00:15:24,830
over what is going to happen with regard

361
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:27,503
to a barrier, a wall
at the southern border?

362
00:15:27,503 --> 00:15:30,030
- Well, I hope that it's narrowing, Judy.

363
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:32,010
I mean, this is a situation
where we're dealing

364
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,961
with a topic that both sides
are making the same argument.

365
00:15:34,961 --> 00:15:37,060
This is the fifth President in a row

366
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:41,030
that's asked Congress for
border funding to build a wall.

367
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,890
H.W. Bush built the first miles,

368
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:45,650
even Barack Obama built 135 miles of wall.

369
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:49,200
Both parties agree that this
is a national security issue,

370
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,740
and we need to do it now.

371
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,900
The problem is the hypocrisy of politics

372
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,520
have brought us to this point.

373
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,970
I'm hopeful that this conference committee

374
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:59,800
is going to get to a
bipartisan solution here

375
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,760
that we can all support,

376
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,210
and I'm hopeful they will, Judy.

377
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,290
- Well, as you know Senator,

378
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:05,240
during the campaign over two years ago,

379
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,700
the President was talking about a wall.

380
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,210
At times he spoke about a concrete wall,

381
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:12,943
at times he spoke about
sea to shining sea.

382
00:16:12,943 --> 00:16:17,572
The President has changed
what he's asking for,

383
00:16:17,572 --> 00:16:19,530
isn't that fair to say?

384
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,610
- Well, this is a man who's, number one,

385
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:24,000
trying to protect the American people.

386
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,647
He's fighting for our national security.

387
00:16:25,647 --> 00:16:28,480
There's 2,000 miles of
that southern border.

388
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,340
650 miles, Judy, already have
some sort of barrier on it,

389
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,630
and he's asking for a
little more than 200 miles,

390
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,440
so I think that puts it in perspective,

391
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,070
but he wants it to be put in positions

392
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,480
where drug trafficking, human trafficking,

393
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,520
and illegal immigration is happening

394
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,030
in the most severe manner right now.

395
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,159
- Do you see the Democrat,
from what you know,

396
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:51,200
we just heard Congressman Clyburn say

397
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,700
he believes there can be success

398
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,120
in that conference committee,

399
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,500
that left to their own devices

400
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,050
they can come up with an agreement?

401
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,520
Do you, are you optimistic
that's gonna happen as well?

402
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,353
- Well, I'm hopeful.

403
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,780
I'm not sure I'm optimistic yet,

404
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,710
but I'm very hopeful.

405
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:06,500
We'll know tomorrow, because
some experts from the border,

406
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,280
these are non-political bent people

407
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,150
who are coming up to give
some advice to the committee,

408
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:14,130
I'm hopeful tomorrow
we'll hear some statements

409
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,470
coming out of that conference committee

410
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,210
that'll give us some optimism

411
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,980
about getting past this impasse.

412
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,270
Look, the other thing, Judy,
is that this is ridiculous.

413
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:24,120
This is a appropriation
issue that should have

414
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,330
been dealt with before
September 30th of last year.

415
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:28,970
We're in the fifth month
of our new fiscal year,

416
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:31,640
so I'm hopeful that
everybody will sober up here

417
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,030
in Congress and get this done this week.

418
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,076
- I think you know,
Senator, the President is

419
00:17:35,076 --> 00:17:37,580
still not ruling out the idea of

420
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,670
declaring a national emergency in order to

421
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:40,726
go ahead and build the wall,

422
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,580
put money aside to build the wall

423
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,120
if there's no agreement in Congress,

424
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,670
but he's been told by
Senate Majority Leader,

425
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:52,080
your colleague, Senator
McConnell, Mitch McConnell,

426
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,686
that that's not a good idea.

427
00:17:53,686 --> 00:17:56,217
Do you think the President still

428
00:17:56,217 --> 00:17:59,116
would seriously consider doing that?

429
00:17:59,116 --> 00:18:01,560
- Well, he has said he
would and I take him

430
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,720
at his word, but, again, this is a man.

431
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,370
I think tonight in the State of the Union,

432
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:07,580
you'll hear President Trump offer a little

433
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,190
more conciliatory tone
because he's a dealmaker

434
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,150
first and last, we all know that.

435
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,310
He just wants to get border security

436
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,690
moving in the right direction

437
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,330
and both parties actually want that,

438
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,060
so I'm hopeful that tonight,

439
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,200
we'll see a little more of that

440
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,150
and then over the next week or so,

441
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:24,349
we'll see something come out
of this conference committee

442
00:18:24,349 --> 00:18:27,060
that will preclude the
need for the President

443
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,420
to do something extreme like that.

444
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,850
He certainly has the right to do it,

445
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:32,650
but I'm hopeful Congress will
step in here and do its job.

446
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:35,810
- Senator, how much, how does it change

447
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:39,660
what the President can do because

448
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,700
Democrats have now won the majority

449
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,100
in the House of Representatives,

450
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,711
that he's dealing with
a different Congress

451
00:18:44,711 --> 00:18:46,250
than he was last year?

452
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,230
- Well, we have a historic opportunity.

453
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:51,000
If you think about Tip O'Neill and Reagan,

454
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,223
you think about Newt
Gingrich and Bill Clinton,

455
00:18:53,223 --> 00:18:55,020
when you had split government is when

456
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,620
really big things did happen here,

457
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:00,980
so the answer is, Nancy Pelosi
has a choice as the Speaker.

458
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,430
Either she's gonna work
with this President,

459
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:04,180
who's been proven that
he will make a deal.

460
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,620
I mean, we did a historic
bipartisan Dodd-Frank bill

461
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,590
just this past year, Judy,
that really helped small banks.

462
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,100
I'm looking for more of that,

463
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,940
so I think the Speaker
has to make a decision.

464
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,680
Is she gonna legislate
with this President,

465
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,230
who's more than willing to do that,

466
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,670
or is she just gonna investigate

467
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:21,137
going into the Presidential
election in 2020?

468
00:19:21,137 --> 00:19:23,160
- But my question is how does it change

469
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,810
what the President is able to do?

470
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:27,930
- Well, if they don't operate with us,

471
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:29,741
then it moves back in the Senate,

472
00:19:29,741 --> 00:19:32,091
and all we're gonna be
focused on are confirmations

473
00:19:32,091 --> 00:19:34,642
and Leader McConnell has talked about

474
00:19:34,642 --> 00:19:36,990
being more aggressive about getting

475
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,870
the confirmations done this year and next,

476
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,170
so we know we can do that.

477
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,760
That's in the hands of the Senate.

478
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,230
I just implore the Senate,
or the House members,

479
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,710
to put pressure on leadership there to,

480
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,660
let's get together and legislate,

481
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,650
which is why the people in
America sent us up here.

482
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:54,950
- There's a report out in
the last few days, Senator,

483
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:58,080
about the Trump administration still not

484
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,830
having submitted names for hundreds of

485
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:04,111
empty positions inside the administration.

486
00:20:04,111 --> 00:20:07,150
Do you have an explanation
for why that is?

487
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:07,983
- Well, yeah.

488
00:20:07,983 --> 00:20:10,511
We've had a historic level
of obstruction, first of all.

489
00:20:10,511 --> 00:20:11,344
Let's put it.

490
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:12,177
- [Judy] No, I'm talk.

491
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:13,010
- No, I understand.

492
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:14,700
The good news is is
that we have done over,

493
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,580
we've confirmed over 85 judges,

494
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:19,660
30 Courts of Appeal judges,
and two Supreme Court Justices

495
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,360
because the party was set there,

496
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,040
but this is a historic situation, Judy,

497
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,810
where this is the first
time in U.S. history

498
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,280
the minority party has not waived

499
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,570
the 30-hour rule in the Senate.

500
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:31,216
Now, having said that, there are over

501
00:20:31,216 --> 00:20:33,860
300 nominations at the end of last year

502
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,710
waiting to be confirmed.

503
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,160
We just need to get down to business

504
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,829
and get past this and stop
playing partisan politics.

505
00:20:39,829 --> 00:20:42,910
This President is, if we
don't change the rule,

506
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,090
and we don't move past this,

507
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,190
this President won't even be able to

508
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,950
put his full complement of government

509
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:49,080
together in the first term of his office.

510
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,240
- Yeah, I'm asking about those positions

511
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,650
for which names have not
even put forward yet.

512
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,710
- Well, first of all, Judy,
there are plenty of names

513
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,490
that have been put
forward that have not been

514
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,670
brought forward because
we can't get to them

515
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:02,260
because of the obstruction of
the Democrats in the Senate,

516
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,269
and when that happens I can promise you

517
00:21:03,269 --> 00:21:05,555
this President will
line 'em up in terms of

518
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:08,460
the nominees waiting to be confirmed.

519
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,760
- Senator David Perdue of
Georgia, thank you very much.

520
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,290
- Thanks, Judy.

521
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:15,580
- So, let's take a step back now

522
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,210
and put this moment in tonight's address

523
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:19,340
in context with Presidential historian

524
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,430
and NewsHour regular Michael Beschloss.

525
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:23,060
Michael Beschloss, wonderful to see you.

526
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:23,893
- Wonderful to see you always.

527
00:21:23,893 --> 00:21:24,991
- Thank you for being here.

528
00:21:24,991 --> 00:21:25,824
- Thank you, Judy.

529
00:21:25,824 --> 00:21:28,248
- So, you've looked at how
Presidents have handled

530
00:21:28,248 --> 00:21:31,805
times of stress, times when
they are facing opposition,

531
00:21:31,805 --> 00:21:33,661
whether new or long-standing.

532
00:21:33,661 --> 00:21:35,810
That seems to be, certainly,

533
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:37,830
what President Trump is facing tonight.

534
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,870
How have other Presidents handled it?

535
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:42,000
- Well, oftentimes they've made a pivot.

536
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,530
I mean, Bill Clinton, for instance,

537
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:47,340
in 1996 was about to run for reelection

538
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,010
and two years earlier,
he had lost Congress

539
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:52,800
to the Republicans,
first time in 40 years.

540
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,620
That was a very big event, so he said,

541
00:21:55,620 --> 00:22:00,020
we remember it now, the era
of big government is over.

542
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,020
That worked for him because people knew

543
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,040
that for the year since the election,

544
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,180
he had been moving steadily to the right

545
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,540
or at least to the center,

546
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:10,341
so when he said those
words it had some meaning,

547
00:22:10,341 --> 00:22:14,240
helped to position him to run
successfully for reelection

548
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,430
and also, I was so interested
that Senator Perdue

549
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:19,400
was talking about Newt
Gingrich and Bill Clinton.

550
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,480
That State of the Union set that up

551
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,960
for Clinton and Gingrich,
by the summer of 1996,

552
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,360
to do welfare reform together,
to balance the budget.

553
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,350
It really changed the
political atmosphere.

554
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:33,490
- So is there a precedent,
Michael Beschloss,

555
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:35,900
for Presidents who've been at loggerheads

556
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,470
with a Congress turning the corner

557
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:41,611
and setting the stage
for there to be real,

558
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:44,020
an ability to work together?

559
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,099
- Yeah, absolutely.

560
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:49,300
1947, Harry Truman went to
give the State of the Union

561
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,850
after he lost Congress to the Republicans

562
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:54,320
for the first time in 16 years.

563
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,970
He knew that there was
a big necessity for him

564
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:59,190
to make deals with the Republicans

565
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:01,891
to prepare the nation
to fight the Cold War

566
00:23:01,891 --> 00:23:05,290
and to try to get some of the
domestic laws that he wanted.

567
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,919
He failed at the latter.

568
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:10,020
- Do you sense, again
from you studied history,

569
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:13,640
studied so many Presidents,
that there is a willingness,

570
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,690
a will, on the part of these two parties

571
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:19,760
that have been fighting each
other for week after week,

572
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,840
day after day, to come together?

573
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,510
- I think they know that an awful lot

574
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:26,810
of Americans would like to see that.

575
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:28,658
That surely shows up in the polls,

576
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:30,760
but there hasn't been much sign of it

577
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,390
during the last month and we will see if

578
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:35,530
this speech changes the atmosphere.

579
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:37,839
I think rarely in
history does that happen.

580
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:39,220
- And that's what I want
to ask you about, too.

581
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,840
How much difference can one speech, one,

582
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,930
granted this is a big deal,

583
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,131
it's the State of the Union.

584
00:23:45,131 --> 00:23:49,459
There's a whole lot of
tradition wrapped around this.

585
00:23:49,459 --> 00:23:50,292
- Sure.

586
00:23:50,292 --> 00:23:52,410
- Can one address make a difference?

587
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:54,810
- If people have the feeling that lurking

588
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:57,650
within Donald Trump has
been this deep desire

589
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:59,780
to make deals with the other side

590
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,440
that hasn't expressed itself,

591
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,670
and he talked about it a
lot during the campaign.

592
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:06,810
2016, a lot of people
voted for Trump did so

593
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:09,130
because he said, I know Chuck Schumer,

594
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:10,520
I can make deals with him,

595
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,760
and they feel in many cases
that it hasn't been expressed,

596
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,640
if we begin to see signs
of that Donald Trump

597
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,120
in the wake of this speech,

598
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,610
things could begin to change.

599
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:20,980
I'm not predicting that.

600
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,177
- Are you, why not?

601
00:24:22,177 --> 00:24:26,710
- Because this speech was preceded by an

602
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:29,350
enormous confrontation, one of the biggest

603
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,488
in legislative White
House relations history

604
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:34,848
that led to a shutdown, may yet again.

605
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:38,180
- And just very quickly, you've looked at

606
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,200
the language this President uses,

607
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,016
the way he communicates
with the American people.

608
00:24:43,016 --> 00:24:48,016
Do you, how much do you expect
him to stay in that lane,

609
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,930
and how much might he?

610
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:50,860
- Not for long.

611
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:53,950
He doesn't enjoy it, we haven't
seen many instances of it.

612
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,250
If we did, the time we would have seen it

613
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,630
would have been in the inauguration

614
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,389
when even the most partisan Presidents

615
00:24:59,389 --> 00:25:01,760
usually give a really unifying speech.

616
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,640
He'd be the first to say he did not.

617
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,600
- Michael Beschloss, thank you.

618
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,779
- My pleasure.

619
00:25:07,779 --> 00:25:08,612
- Nice to have you.

620
00:25:08,612 --> 00:25:09,445
Appreciate it.

621
00:25:09,445 --> 00:25:11,360
And now, some perspective
on the run-up to tonight's

622
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,130
big address from opposite sides

623
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:14,660
of the American political spectrum.

624
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:18,540
Karine Jean-Pierre is a
senior advisor for MoveOn.org

625
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,450
and Chris Buskirk is the editor of the

626
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:23,130
conservative journal and
web site American Greatness.

627
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:23,997
Hello to both of you.

628
00:25:23,997 --> 00:25:24,899
- Hi.
- Hi, Judy.

629
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:25,959
- Great to have you back on the program.

630
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:27,629
Chris, to you first, Chris Buskirk.

631
00:25:27,629 --> 00:25:30,780
What do you expect the
President to do tonight?

632
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,620
- I think what the
President's gonna do tonight

633
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:35,250
is he is going to do what he's done,

634
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:37,260
I think pretty well in
some speeches before,

635
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:41,070
which he's going to go back to
promises made, promises kept.

636
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,610
Here's what I talked about in my campaign,

637
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,090
here's what I've accomplished so far,

638
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:45,398
here's what I still need to do,

639
00:25:45,398 --> 00:25:46,909
and I think that, here we are halfway

640
00:25:46,909 --> 00:25:48,810
through the first term, right.

641
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:51,690
This has got to be the
pivot to reelection,

642
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:53,480
so try to start to set the tone

643
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,298
and set the trajectory for a message

644
00:25:55,298 --> 00:25:58,020
that's going to carry him
through November of 2020,

645
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:02,120
and I think that needs to
be one big unifying theme

646
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,270
that says, on immigration,
on trade, on foreign policy,

647
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,770
how are all these things linked together?

648
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,270
What's that unifying theme?

649
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,210
And I think that that theme has to be

650
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:11,859
how do you rebuild the middle
class, that's number one,

651
00:26:11,859 --> 00:26:14,010
and I think that that's
what he's gonna try and do.

652
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:17,980
- And if that's what he
does, Karine Jean-Pierre,

653
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,040
how is that received by Democrats?

654
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,830
- So, I know that it's been reported that,

655
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,233
from the administration,
from the White House,

656
00:26:24,233 --> 00:26:27,310
that the President is going
to give a speech on unity,

657
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:29,750
on greatness, on bipartisanship,

658
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:32,640
and that would be great
if he was able to do that,

659
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,520
but we haven't seen
that from this President

660
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,669
in the past, now going on three years,

661
00:26:36,669 --> 00:26:39,540
and I just don't see the speech,

662
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:42,210
only because of his
history, of his record,

663
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:44,637
being that impactful, so
maybe, maybe he gets there

664
00:26:44,637 --> 00:26:46,059
and he makes a unity speech,

665
00:26:46,059 --> 00:26:49,410
but hours later, the
moment he gets on Twitter,

666
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,230
it all, he steps on it.

667
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:53,230
So, I just, it's hard to believe

668
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:55,370
and let's not forget, a couple weeks ago,

669
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:58,140
he gave, he addressed the country

670
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,950
in a diplomatic reception room

671
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,600
where he talked about immigration,

672
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,370
and that was filled with division,

673
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:06,510
and then he did it weeks prior to that

674
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:09,100
in the Oval Office
behind the Resolute desk

675
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,670
and that was filled
with division and hate,

676
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:13,589
so I just don't see how that's possible

677
00:27:13,589 --> 00:27:14,930
coming from this President.

678
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:16,120
- And in fact, Chris Buskirk,

679
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,370
I had a chance today
to spend a little bit,

680
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:19,920
a few minutes with Speaker Pelosi

681
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,130
and the Senate Minority
Leader, Chuck Schumer,

682
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:23,410
and Mr. Schumer made a point,

683
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,310
Senator Schumer made a point of saying,

684
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,450
we hope the President's
going to appeal to unity,

685
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:31,240
but in the past, when
he's spoken at a moment

686
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,537
whether it's the State
of the Union address

687
00:27:33,537 --> 00:27:35,330
or another speech, he's made promises

688
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:36,800
or made declarations that he then

689
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,020
turned around and didn't fulfill,

690
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,899
so what makes you convinced

691
00:27:40,899 --> 00:27:43,170
that tonight is gonna be different?

692
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,117
- Well, I think part of that's

693
00:27:44,117 --> 00:27:46,040
in the eye of the beholder, right.

694
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,873
What is unity?

695
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:47,937
I mean, there's part of it that is

696
00:27:47,937 --> 00:27:50,387
the art of persuasion,
which is to talk about it

697
00:27:50,387 --> 00:27:52,130
and to use the rhetoric of unity

698
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:54,139
and to talk about how do we,

699
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:56,120
how are we Americans together,

700
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,230
what does that mean and how
do we build things together,

701
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,908
make this a better society.

702
00:27:59,908 --> 00:28:02,740
How that translates
into practice, I think,

703
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,880
is where the President
needs to be very concrete.

704
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,790
He needs to use that
rhetoric, but then say,

705
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,520
look, these are the
policies we're gonna pursue

706
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,060
in my administration to try
and make this a reality,

707
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,150
and that's what everybody's
really looking for.

708
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,276
It's nice to hear the good speech,

709
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:15,749
but then what are you gonna do about it?

710
00:28:15,749 --> 00:28:19,300
- But you have a sense
that now, Chris Buskirk,

711
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,060
the President's prepared to do that?

712
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,340
- I think he has to, and I think that's

713
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,657
what he's gonna try and do.

714
00:28:24,657 --> 00:28:25,517
- But, Karine,

715
00:28:25,517 --> 00:28:26,650
(laughing)

716
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:28,760
you're expressing doubt.

717
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,910
- I, he just doesn't have
a record of it, Judy.

718
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,037
We have not seen that.

719
00:28:32,037 --> 00:28:34,160
A year ago, he talked about unity.

720
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,330
What did we get months later?

721
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:39,840
We got the zero policy situation

722
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,450
where children were being
ripped away from their parents,

723
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:44,170
children of undocumented immigrants

724
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:45,740
coming through the southern border,

725
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:47,350
and that was devastating to see

726
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,860
and now we're hearing many of them

727
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,210
will never be reunited,

728
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:52,350
and the year before that, in 2017,

729
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:54,660
in the joint address, the same thing,

730
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,509
and what did we see?

731
00:28:56,509 --> 00:28:57,342
We heard about Charlottesville

732
00:28:57,342 --> 00:28:58,175
and what did he do there?

733
00:28:58,175 --> 00:29:01,010
He said, very fine people on both sides.

734
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:02,570
I just don't see it.

735
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:04,610
- When you hear this, Chris Buskirk,

736
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:05,530
what do you think?

737
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:09,200
- I think that unity does not
mean agreement on everything

738
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,597
and that's okay, that's
what politics is for.

739
00:29:11,597 --> 00:29:16,200
I think what unity means is
not that Donald Trump says,

740
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,130
well, to Speaker Pelosi,

741
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,469
okay whatever you want, that's fine.

742
00:29:19,469 --> 00:29:21,540
I think what it means is how do we

743
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,437
identify the problems
that the country faces

744
00:29:23,437 --> 00:29:25,970
and then how do we work together

745
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,389
where there's agreement
and then we can disagree

746
00:29:27,389 --> 00:29:30,030
on other things too, but
let's do that in a way

747
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:32,836
where we at least try and set
the table on common goals.

748
00:29:32,836 --> 00:29:36,273
- And I guess the flip
side of the question,

749
00:29:36,273 --> 00:29:38,468
Karine Jean-Pierre, is are Democrats

750
00:29:38,468 --> 00:29:42,878
or people like you who work
hard with organizations.

751
00:29:42,878 --> 00:29:43,711
- Yeah.

752
00:29:43,711 --> 00:29:44,788
- Who oppose so much of
the President's policies,

753
00:29:44,788 --> 00:29:46,340
are you willing to give the President

754
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,173
the benefit of the doubt?

755
00:29:47,173 --> 00:29:48,370
- There are things that we can work on

756
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,690
that's bipartisanship, which is DACA,

757
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:52,250
infrastructure, improving.

758
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,083
- [Judy] Which is immigration.

759
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:57,530
- Immigration, right, for
young undocumented folks

760
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:00,937
who came here with their parents
when they were really young

761
00:30:00,937 --> 00:30:03,990
and there's also the
criminal justice, right?

762
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,590
That was done in a bipartisan way.

763
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,857
It was a first step, and
there's more to be done.

764
00:30:07,857 --> 00:30:10,300
The problem is, and what we said earlier,

765
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,420
he declares things in his speech

766
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,430
but then he doesn't stick to them

767
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:16,090
and I think Democrats are ready

768
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,270
to work on those things I just mentioned,

769
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,828
but he doesn't stick to it.

770
00:30:19,828 --> 00:30:23,140
- I want to look at this,
step back a little bit,

771
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,200
Chris Buskirk, because part
of what's going on here

772
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,297
is that many of the people
who support the President

773
00:30:27,297 --> 00:30:30,350
don't seem to want him to cooperate

774
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,440
with the other side and Karine,

775
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,930
I think you could say that about

776
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:34,640
a number of progressive liberal Democrats

777
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,160
who don't want to see
their party cooperate.

778
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,160
What about that, Chris?

779
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,360
- Well, the best way for me,
at least, to think about it

780
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,240
is to use a concrete illustration.

781
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,440
So you think about the immigration issue.

782
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,140
I mean, this is a place where people like

783
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,580
Speaker Pelosi and
Minority Leader Schumer,

784
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,090
you know, 10 years ago, 12 years ago,

785
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:52,180
they were talking, yes we need a wall,

786
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,126
we need border security.

787
00:30:53,126 --> 00:30:54,880
I think what the President needs to do

788
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,940
is explain why that's important

789
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,320
and how that is something that protects,

790
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,810
how border security
protects working families,

791
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:03,909
American working families.

792
00:31:03,909 --> 00:31:07,340
Why, because it protects
their most valuable asset,

793
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:09,400
which is their asymmetric access

794
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,160
to the American labor market.

795
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,963
Make that argument, maybe in a more.

796
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:16,110
- [Judy] In other words,
immigrants take jobs away from you?

797
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,088
Is that, I mean?

798
00:31:17,088 --> 00:31:19,530
- Take jobs away, lower wages.

799
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:23,100
I mean, more supply equals,
more supply lowers prices.

800
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:23,933
That's basic.

801
00:31:23,933 --> 00:31:26,080
You explain that to people and say,

802
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,230
look, this is why
immigration's important to me,

803
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:31,320
or this is why trade
policy's important to me,

804
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,210
'cause I want middle income families

805
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:34,925
to be secure economically

806
00:31:34,925 --> 00:31:36,440
and they to be able to prosper.

807
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,500
- And Karine, the flip side of that.

808
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,896
Liberal Democrats don't
want their party leaders

809
00:31:40,896 --> 00:31:42,780
to work together with the President.

810
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:46,860
- Well, they want Democrats,
in particular in the House

811
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,900
now that it's the majority,

812
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,530
to hold this President accountable,

813
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:52,880
and that's one of the reasons
that we took back the House,

814
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,940
and so that's really important,

815
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,904
and that looks in very
different ways, right?

816
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:57,976
That's looking at this Mueller report.

817
00:31:57,976 --> 00:32:01,420
That's also looking at, as I mentioned,

818
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,180
the children being
separated at the border,

819
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,160
Puerto Rico, 3,000 people died,

820
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,350
but they also want to see Democrats

821
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:09,100
moving the country forward, right,

822
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,090
and they've done that with voting rights

823
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:13,370
and dealing with corruption and so

824
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:16,263
those are things that
they actually want to see,

825
00:32:18,635 --> 00:32:19,468
but we need Republicans
on the other side to do,

826
00:32:19,468 --> 00:32:21,166
to also in there with us, too.

827
00:32:21,166 --> 00:32:22,680
- All right, we're gonna have a chance

828
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,560
to talk about all this again later tonight

829
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,870
when we've heard what
the President has to say.

830
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:29,250
Thank you so much, Karine
Jean-Pierre, Chris Buskirk.

831
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,083
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

832
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:32,470
(upbeat music)

833
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:42,190
- And now for a roundup of
today's other main headlines.

834
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:43,090
Here's Amna Nawaz.

835
00:32:44,115 --> 00:32:47,020
- In the non-State of
the Union news today,

836
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:49,340
the White House played
down a federal subpoena

837
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,715
seeking a host of documents

838
00:32:50,715 --> 00:32:53,370
from President Trump's
inaugural committee.

839
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:55,520
Federal prosecutors in
New York are investigating

840
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,110
who gave the money and what they

841
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,840
might have received in return.

842
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,886
White House spokeswoman
Sarah Sanders called it

843
00:33:00,886 --> 00:33:05,130
"hysteria over the fact
that Mr. Trump was elected."

844
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:06,865
- This doesn't have anything
to do with the White House,

845
00:33:06,865 --> 00:33:09,690
and I think the biggest focus

846
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:11,254
and the thing that most
Americans care about

847
00:33:11,254 --> 00:33:13,060
has nothing to do with the inaugural

848
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,275
and it has everything to do

849
00:33:14,275 --> 00:33:16,753
with what the path forward looks like.

850
00:33:16,753 --> 00:33:19,240
- Investigators are also
looking into whether

851
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,730
any foreign donors illegally contributed

852
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:23,620
to the inaugural committee.

853
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,760
One of President Trump's judicial nominees

854
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,806
voiced regrets today
for her past statements

855
00:33:27,806 --> 00:33:30,830
on rape, race, and equal rights.

856
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:33,840
Neomi Rao appeared before the
Senate Judiciary Committee.

857
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,010
Senators on both sides criticized her

858
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:38,785
for writing in college
that women bear some blame

859
00:33:38,785 --> 00:33:42,700
if they're sexually
assaulted while intoxicated.

860
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,990
- To be honest, looking back
at some of those writings

861
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,730
and rereading them, I cringe at some

862
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:47,870
of the language that I used.

863
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:51,600
Now, I've had a lot of
experience since that time

864
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,023
writing in college, and
I don't think I would

865
00:33:55,023 --> 00:33:56,350
express myself in the same way.

866
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,590
These are horrible crimes,

867
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:59,935
and I wouldn't write
anything that might be

868
00:33:59,935 --> 00:34:01,775
implied to blame a victim or make it

869
00:34:01,775 --> 00:34:04,730
less likely for a victim to come forward.

870
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:06,810
- Rao currently leads
the White House office

871
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:08,550
overseeing deregulation.

872
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:11,020
If confirmed, she'd take the
federal Appeals Court seat

873
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:14,940
held by Brett Kavanaugh before
he joined the Supreme Court.

874
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,125
Overseas, in Afghanistan,
Taliban attacks killed

875
00:34:17,125 --> 00:34:21,130
nearly 50 people in
two northern provinces.

876
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:23,815
A pre-dawn raid killed
26 soldiers and police

877
00:34:23,815 --> 00:34:25,990
at an army base in Kunduz province,

878
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:27,850
on the outskirts of Kunduz City.

879
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:31,010
Attacks in neighboring
provinces killed 21 others.

880
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:33,873
The Taliban have kept up their offensive,

881
00:34:33,873 --> 00:34:37,000
even amid early stages of
peace talks with the U.S.

882
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,090
The top U.S. commander
in the Middle East says

883
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:40,833
President Trump did not talk to him

884
00:34:40,833 --> 00:34:44,990
before announcing American
forces will withdraw from Syria.

885
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:47,460
Army General Joseph Votel testified

886
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,770
at a Senate hearing
today and was questioned

887
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:52,030
by Maine Senator Angus King.

888
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:54,320
- General, were you aware
of the President's intention

889
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,590
to order the withdrawal
of our troops from Syria

890
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:59,600
before that was publicly announced?

891
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:04,290
- I was not aware of the
specific announcement.

892
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:09,090
Certainly we are aware that
he had expressed a desire

893
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:12,300
and intent in the past to
depart Iraq, er, I meant Syria.

894
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,147
- So you weren't consulted

895
00:35:14,147 --> 00:35:15,770
before that decision was announced?

896
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:17,980
- [Votel] We were not,
I was not consulted.

897
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,920
- Votel's remarks came a day after

898
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,280
the Defense Department warned that

899
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,590
Islamic State fighters could resurge

900
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,681
in Syria after the U.S. withdraws,

901
00:35:25,681 --> 00:35:27,670
and this afternoon the Senate approved

902
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:29,420
a Middle East security bill that warns

903
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:32,473
against any sudden pullout
from Syria or Afghanistan.

904
00:35:32,473 --> 00:35:35,663
It also calls for new sanctions on Syria.

905
00:35:35,663 --> 00:35:38,740
Pope Francis has celebrated the first ever

906
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,903
Papal mass on the Arabian peninsula.

907
00:35:40,903 --> 00:35:44,030
Some 180,000 people gathered today

908
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,940
at a sports stadium in Abu Dhabi,

909
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,090
capital of the United Arab Emirates.

910
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:49,612
Francis preached humility

911
00:35:49,612 --> 00:35:51,921
in one of the world's richest nations.

912
00:35:51,921 --> 00:35:56,343
(speaking foreign language)

913
00:35:56,343 --> 00:35:57,921
- [Papal Translator] For
Jesus on the other hand,

914
00:35:57,921 --> 00:36:00,142
blessed are the poor, the meek,

915
00:36:00,142 --> 00:36:02,623
those who remain just, even at the cost

916
00:36:02,623 --> 00:36:06,430
of appearing in a bad light,
those who are persecuted.

917
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:09,193
He taught us that greatness
is not found in having

918
00:36:09,193 --> 00:36:11,320
but rather in giving.

919
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,651
- Later, the Pope acknowledged,
for the first time,

920
00:36:13,651 --> 00:36:17,140
the scandal of priests
sexually abusing nuns.

921
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:19,760
He said he's committed
to fighting the problem.

922
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,790
Millions of people, meanwhile,
in Asia and around the world

923
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:24,810
marked the Lunar New Year today.

924
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:28,250
In Taiwan, thousands gathered
to pray at a Buddhist temple.

925
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:30,640
In the Philippines,
people bought roasted pig,

926
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,460
a delicacy, to usher
in the Year of the Pig,

927
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:36,220
and all across China,
crowds visited temples

928
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:38,193
and took part in festivals.

929
00:36:38,193 --> 00:36:40,660
Back in this country, Texas lawmakers

930
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:43,530
complained today the state
still has not received

931
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:45,800
Hurricane Harvey recovery funds.

932
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,460
The storm did major damage
in 2017 and last February,

933
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:53,230
Congress earmarked some
$4.4 billion for Texas,

934
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:55,260
but no grants have actually been made.

935
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:58,090
The state's Republican
senators plus 10 House members

936
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:01,220
from both parties say
federal budget bureaucracy

937
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,460
is what's standing in the way.

938
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:06,710
An outspoken critic of the
World Bank, David Malpass,

939
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,430
looks like he'll be President Trump's

940
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,500
choice to lead the agency.

941
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,970
It was widely reported today that

942
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:14,040
the President will nominate him this week.

943
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,670
The World Bank provides loans
and projects around the world,

944
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,390
but Malpass has complained it's

945
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:20,810
piling up debt without results.

946
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:22,780
Also today, Andrew Wheeler won

947
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:25,760
a Senate Committee's approval
to be head of the EPA.

948
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,223
His nomination now goes
to the full Senate,

949
00:37:28,223 --> 00:37:32,390
and on Wall Street, a series
of strong earnings reports

950
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:33,833
gave stocks another boost.

951
00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:37,300
The Dow Jones industrial
average gained 172 points

952
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:40,030
to close at 25,411.

953
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,993
The NASDAQ rose 54 points,

954
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:45,660
and the S&P 500 added 12.

955
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,073
Still to come on the NewsHour,

956
00:37:47,073 --> 00:37:49,550
reaction to the President's comments

957
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,410
that the U.S. will use a base in Iraq

958
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:53,091
to keep eyes on Iran.

959
00:37:53,091 --> 00:37:57,300
A rigorous program prepares
Black undergraduates

960
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,212
to go on to medical school.

961
00:37:59,212 --> 00:38:02,870
Plus, SAS Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah gives her

962
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:05,703
brief but spectacular
take on fearlessness.

963
00:38:05,703 --> 00:38:08,286
(upbeat music)

964
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:19,050
- As we reported, the top
U.S. military commander

965
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:21,530
for the Middle East was
on Capitol Hill today.

966
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:23,302
In addition to the fight against ISIS,

967
00:38:23,302 --> 00:38:26,660
he was asked about recent
comments by President Trump

968
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:29,070
suggesting American troops in Iraq

969
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:30,900
could shift their mission,

970
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,220
and as Nick Schifrin reports,

971
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:35,470
those comments about
U.S. troops watching Iran

972
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:37,690
have sparked deep concern in Iraq.

973
00:38:39,268 --> 00:38:41,982
- [Schifrin] Near the Iraqi-Syrian border,

974
00:38:41,982 --> 00:38:44,810
(yelling in foreign language)

975
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:47,690
an Iraqi soldier and his American advisor

976
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:49,990
line up artillery to strike ISIS.

977
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:50,823
(mortar firing)

978
00:38:50,823 --> 00:38:53,300
Outside Baghdad, U.S.
Special Operations forces

979
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,510
train Iraq's elite
counterterrorism service,

980
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:57,080
(gun rapidly firing)

981
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,840
and Iraqi soldiers learn
to fire American rifles

982
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,290
from anti-ISIS coalition troops.

983
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:03,750
These scenes of partnership,

984
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:06,250
filmed by the U.S. military
over the past year,

985
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:08,710
show what Iraq has invited the U.S. to do.

986
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:09,543
- [Soldier] Fire!

987
00:39:09,543 --> 00:39:10,853
(gun booming)

988
00:39:10,853 --> 00:39:14,490
- [Schifren] 5,200 troops
train Iraqi security forces

989
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:16,810
and target ISIS fighters
who lost territory

990
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:18,760
but resumed insurgent tactics,

991
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,810
but this weekend, President Trump

992
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:23,680
told CBS's Margaret Brennan
the mission should expand.

993
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,060
- And one of the reasons I want to keep it

994
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:28,460
is because I want to be
looking a little bit at Iran,

995
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,440
because Iran is a real problem.

996
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,740
- Whoa, that's news.

997
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,160
You're keeping troops in Iraq

998
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,310
because you want to be
able to strike in Iran?

999
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:37,550
- No, because I want to
be able to watch Iran.

1000
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:39,270
All I want to do is be able to watch.

1001
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:41,150
- [Schifren] But even watching Iran

1002
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:43,800
exceeds the tasks Iraq has approved.

1003
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,260
Today Iraqi Prime
Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi,

1004
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,029
who has been working
with the United States,

1005
00:39:48,029 --> 00:39:50,022
criticized President Trump.

1006
00:39:50,022 --> 00:39:51,779
(speaking foreign language)

1007
00:39:51,779 --> 00:39:52,612
- [Iraqi Translator] I don't think

1008
00:39:52,612 --> 00:39:53,445
that such statements are useful.

1009
00:39:53,445 --> 00:39:54,720
In fact, they won't help much

1010
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,887
and I hope that he would
back down from them.

1011
00:39:56,887 --> 00:39:59,430
- [Schifren] In a statement,
First Deputy Speaker

1012
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,190
Hassan al-Kaabi repeated a vow

1013
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,847
that Parliament would pass a law

1014
00:40:02,847 --> 00:40:05,387
"terminating the security
agreement with America,

1015
00:40:05,387 --> 00:40:07,057
"in addition to ending the presence

1016
00:40:07,057 --> 00:40:09,387
"of American military
trainers and advisors

1017
00:40:09,387 --> 00:40:11,622
"and foreigners on Iraqi soil,"

1018
00:40:11,622 --> 00:40:12,455
(speaking foreign language)

1019
00:40:12,455 --> 00:40:14,340
and on a Lebanon-based
TV network on Sunday,

1020
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:17,460
Iranian-backed militia
spokesman Jaafar al-Husseini

1021
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:20,020
hinted militias had the
capacity to evict the U.S.

1022
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,070
(speaking foreign language)

1023
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:22,580
- [Iranian Translator] All of our options

1024
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,970
are open in front of us.

1025
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:26,850
We have the ability and
resources to execute them.

1026
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:28,890
- What the President's remarks have done

1027
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:30,671
is to make it more difficult for

1028
00:40:30,671 --> 00:40:34,670
even America's closest allies
and the Iraqi political class

1029
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:38,920
to continue to advocate for
the American presence in Iraq.

1030
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,803
- [Schifren] Feisal Istrabadi
is a former Iraqi diplomat

1031
00:40:40,803 --> 00:40:43,580
and directs Indiana University's Center

1032
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,240
for the Study of the Middle East.

1033
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,460
The Iraqi Parliament was
already debating a bill

1034
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,000
that would evict the U.S.

1035
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,360
That momentum will
increase and put pressure

1036
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,390
on Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi,

1037
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:55,654
who leads a government
considered technically capable

1038
00:40:55,654 --> 00:40:58,170
but has no natural constituency.

1039
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:01,574
- He was turned to by the
political parties in Parliament

1040
00:41:01,574 --> 00:41:04,139
and asked to form a government.

1041
00:41:04,139 --> 00:41:06,662
He is in that sense a
relatively weak Prime Minister

1042
00:41:06,662 --> 00:41:09,030
and you don't want the Prime Minister

1043
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:10,970
in a political battle with Parliament

1044
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:13,540
because in the Iraqi system,

1045
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:16,083
the Prime Minister will always lose.

1046
00:41:16,083 --> 00:41:18,140
- [Schifren] Today the top
commander in the Middle East,

1047
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:21,040
General Joseph Votel, tried
to reassure that the U.S.

1048
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,150
Respected Iraqi wishes.

1049
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:24,590
- Our military mission on the ground

1050
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:27,710
remains very focused on the reason

1051
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:29,847
that the government of Iraq
asked us to come there.

1052
00:41:29,847 --> 00:41:31,820
- [Schiffren] And he suggested
the President's comments

1053
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,860
had not become a military order.

1054
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:36,300
Virginia Democrat Senator Tim Kaine.

1055
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,240
- And as far as you know,

1056
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:40,070
there is not a change in the
definition of the mission,

1057
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,850
at least as far as the
Pentagon is concerned?

1058
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:43,752
- I have no additional tasks that have

1059
00:41:43,752 --> 00:41:46,380
been given to me with regard to that.

1060
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,580
- If the U.S. were to
change its definition

1061
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,630
of the mission in Iraq to be a mission

1062
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:53,370
about watching Iran, wouldn't
it be pretty important

1063
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:56,120
to have Iraq agree that that would be

1064
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,460
the focus of the mission if we were

1065
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:59,720
to be having troops in their country

1066
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,050
to carry out such a mission?

1067
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:02,760
- Senator, we are in
Iraq at the invitation

1068
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,950
of the government, so yes I agree.

1069
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:07,860
- I think that this
statement is not enough.

1070
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,090
- [Schiffren] Abbas Kadhim
leads the Atlantic Council's

1071
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:12,643
Iraq Initiative and recently
met with President Salih.

1072
00:42:12,643 --> 00:42:15,551
Kadhim says thanks to
President Trump's statement,

1073
00:42:15,551 --> 00:42:19,870
Iran's powerful allies can
now use the Iraqi constitution

1074
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:22,040
to argue against U.S. presence,

1075
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,337
because it requires Iraq to

1076
00:42:23,337 --> 00:42:25,737
"adhere to the principle
of noninterference

1077
00:42:25,737 --> 00:42:28,240
"in the internal affairs of other states."

1078
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:32,874
- Iran has more friends
inside Iraqi Parliament,

1079
00:42:32,874 --> 00:42:37,874
and also inside the government
and inside even the public

1080
00:42:38,227 --> 00:42:42,700
and these friends are
willing to indulge Iran.

1081
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:45,970
Before Sunday, they
did not have the votes.

1082
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:49,270
Now I am told by some Parliament members

1083
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:50,960
that they have the votes at least

1084
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,840
to have it pass through the first reading.

1085
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,563
That is a major shift.

1086
00:42:55,563 --> 00:42:56,396
(rotors whirring)

1087
00:42:56,396 --> 00:42:57,240
- [Schiffren] Iraqi leaders admit

1088
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,923
they knew all along U.S. troops in Iraq

1089
00:42:58,923 --> 00:43:01,120
were likely conducting extra missions,

1090
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,610
even watching Iran, but until Sunday

1091
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:05,170
that was never made public.

1092
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:07,810
- That veil of plausible deniability

1093
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:10,120
or willful ignorance,
whatever you want to call it,

1094
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,270
that's been lifted.

1095
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:12,770
The President of the United States

1096
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:14,100
has blatantly announced

1097
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:16,197
what his agenda actually is.

1098
00:43:16,197 --> 00:43:17,240
- [Schiffren] And that means,

1099
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,550
for the U.S. and Iraqi
officials whose agenda

1100
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:22,859
is to improve Iraq, their
mission became much harder.

1101
00:43:22,859 --> 00:43:23,692
(gun firing)

1102
00:43:23,692 --> 00:43:25,558
For the PBS NewsHour, I'm Nick Schiffren.

1103
00:43:25,558 --> 00:43:28,141
(upbeat music)

1104
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:37,180
While Virginia's governor Ralph Northam

1105
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:38,677
weighs whether to resign,

1106
00:43:38,677 --> 00:43:41,140
reaction and anger keeps building

1107
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:44,450
over the racist photo in
his medical school yearbook.

1108
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:47,040
One important part of
that is how it serves

1109
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,330
as a reminder of racism
in medicine historically.

1110
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:52,460
We reported on the importance of training

1111
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:54,980
more African-Americans to become doctors,

1112
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,860
and tonight we have a second look

1113
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:59,267
at a story on Xavier University.

1114
00:43:59,267 --> 00:44:01,650
It's a small, historically Black college

1115
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:04,250
in New Orleans that's
helping lead the way.

1116
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:07,208
Hari Sreenivasan reports on
what sets the school apart

1117
00:44:07,208 --> 00:44:10,033
for our education
series, Making the Grade.

1118
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,050
- Can any of y'all come up to the board

1119
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:16,000
and describe the glycolysis
cycle, like write it out?

1120
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,810
- [Sreenivasan] On the
campus of Xavier University,

1121
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:20,650
18-year old Chris Webb
leads a biology review

1122
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:22,830
the night before a major test.

1123
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:23,787
- All you really need to know.

1124
00:44:23,787 --> 00:44:25,970
- [Sreenivasan] Webb is
helping fellow freshmen who,

1125
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:29,019
like him, are enrolled in a
rigorous pre-medical program.

1126
00:44:29,019 --> 00:44:32,100
- I want them to do as best as they can.

1127
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,550
- [Sreenivasan] The
scene is a familiar one

1128
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:36,470
on the campus of Xavier, a
historically Black college

1129
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:37,303
in the heart of New Orleans.

1130
00:44:37,303 --> 00:44:40,650
- So what's the second stage
in aerobic respiration?

1131
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:44,118
- The second stage is
formation of acetyl coenzyme A.

1132
00:44:44,118 --> 00:44:44,951
- Okay.

1133
00:44:44,951 --> 00:44:46,240
- [Sreenivasan] Students
quiz each other on material

1134
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,359
from tough science classes,
the kind of courses

1135
00:44:48,359 --> 00:44:50,980
that often weed out pre-medical students.

1136
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,880
- I don't want them to do better than me,

1137
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,020
but when they do, that
just makes me realize,

1138
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:57,540
okay this competition is really serious.

1139
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:01,180
While we're having fun,
it's also very real.

1140
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:04,870
- There are just over 3,000
students at Xavier University,

1141
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:08,340
but the school manages to
graduate more African-Americans

1142
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:11,670
who go on to become doctors
than any other school.

1143
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:13,860
That includes elite public universities

1144
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:15,730
and the Ivy Leagues.

1145
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:17,790
That number is even more striking

1146
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:21,060
given a drop in Black males
applying to medical schools.

1147
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:22,910
According to a recent report from the

1148
00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:25,150
Association of American Medical Colleges,

1149
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:26,850
fewer Black males are applying to

1150
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:30,300
medical schools now than in 1978.

1151
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:33,000
Reynold Verret, Xavier's president.

1152
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,100
- We do not compete to say who's better.

1153
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,890
It's almost like a relay race.

1154
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:39,990
The goal is to finish together,

1155
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:41,640
so our students actually embrace

1156
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,050
and encourage each other to achieve.

1157
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:47,050
- That turns on its head
traditional pre-med programs.

1158
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:48,180
- Oh yes, it does.

1159
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:51,470
- Which is look to the
left, look to the right.

1160
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:52,470
- One of you's gone.

1161
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:53,303
- [Sreenivasan] Right?

1162
00:45:53,303 --> 00:45:54,136
- Yes.

1163
00:45:54,136 --> 00:45:56,250
We want to get through
because the competition

1164
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:58,557
is actually after we
leave Xavier, not here.

1165
00:45:58,557 --> 00:46:00,333
The point is to get out there together.

1166
00:46:00,333 --> 00:46:01,390
- [Student] Glucose make two.

1167
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:03,720
- [Sreenivasan] Call it
competitive collaboration.

1168
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:06,110
Head of student advising
Quo Vadis Webster.

1169
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:07,160
- At some schools, you say

1170
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,210
look to your left, look to your right,

1171
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:09,370
this person may not be here.

1172
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:11,750
Here, we say look to your
left, look to your right,

1173
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:12,883
you better help the person next to you

1174
00:46:12,883 --> 00:46:15,380
so that we can all make it.

1175
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:18,150
- [Sreenivasan] The intense
student advising starts early.

1176
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,320
- How are you, my dear?

1177
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,153
- [Student] I'm great, how are you?

1178
00:46:20,153 --> 00:46:22,350
- Good, everything is filled out?

1179
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:23,650
- [Sreenivasan] Incoming freshmen begin

1180
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:25,210
crafting medical school applications,

1181
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:28,760
even before their first
day as an undergraduate.

1182
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,720
- Before classes start, we
go over a different aspect

1183
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,820
of the process of preparing a competitive

1184
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:35,010
application to medical school.

1185
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:38,280
- And you're starting before
they actually walk in the door?

1186
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:39,113
- Have to.

1187
00:46:39,113 --> 00:46:41,250
You need six semesters at least,

1188
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:43,490
'cause that's six
semesters before you apply.

1189
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:46,830
You need every last one of
those semesters and summers

1190
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:49,700
to put into making yourself
a competitive applicant.

1191
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:52,070
- One of the phosphates is broken off.

1192
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:53,840
- [Sreenivasan] The
pre-med program also relies

1193
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,191
heavily on tutoring by upperclassmen.

1194
00:46:56,191 --> 00:46:58,870
Bradley Dunn says he
could not have made it

1195
00:46:58,870 --> 00:47:01,599
through his first semester
without the free tutoring center.

1196
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:03,850
Dunn's student tutor, Chinyere Jones.

1197
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:05,330
- Basically, whenever he had a break,

1198
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:07,100
he was in the tutoring center.

1199
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:09,031
I was like, geez.

1200
00:47:09,031 --> 00:47:11,710
- [Sreenivasan] Dunn believes
students helping students

1201
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:14,870
comes in part from shared
experiences about race.

1202
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:16,431
- They're able to understand

1203
00:47:16,431 --> 00:47:19,250
the plight of African-Americans.

1204
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:21,101
It's more relatable
and it's more intimate,

1205
00:47:21,101 --> 00:47:26,101
and we all know the pitfalls
that we may face as people,

1206
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,170
and together we're a unit,

1207
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:30,920
and I'm actually taking
pride in that blackness.

1208
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:31,962
- The second part of that question,

1209
00:47:31,962 --> 00:47:36,810
that's the one I didn't
necessarily understand.

1210
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:38,310
- [Sreenivasan] Race is
also an important factor

1211
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:41,600
for Chris Webb, who chose
Xavier over full scholarships

1212
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,450
to other universities including
Vanderbilt and Tulane.

1213
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:45,750
- Seeing people that looked like me

1214
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:47,981
and getting to med school
and through med school,

1215
00:47:47,981 --> 00:47:51,191
it motivates me more competing
with people that are like me.

1216
00:47:51,191 --> 00:47:52,690
- [Sreenivasan] One of those role models

1217
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:53,930
is Dr. Ryan Jupiter.

1218
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:55,550
- All right, if you don't mind,

1219
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:57,000
I'm gonna take a listen to you right now.

1220
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,240
- [Sreenivasan] Jupiter
is a resident doctor

1221
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,410
in the emergency department of

1222
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:01,101
New Orleans University Medical Center.

1223
00:48:01,101 --> 00:48:04,470
A Xavier alumni, he
visits campus regularly

1224
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:05,949
to tell students his own story

1225
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:08,750
as the first in his
family to go to college.

1226
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:11,930
- I wanted to make sure
that I could look like I do

1227
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:15,450
and still be able to
become what I want to be.

1228
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:16,580
- [Sreenivasan] How important is that?

1229
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:19,252
I mean, do you think that young black men

1230
00:48:19,252 --> 00:48:22,210
don't see that enough?

1231
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:24,722
- Definitely, I don't
think they do at all.

1232
00:48:24,722 --> 00:48:27,990
It's a long journey, and
when you see other people

1233
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:29,847
who put in the time and the work

1234
00:48:29,847 --> 00:48:31,730
and see the results of it,

1235
00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:36,620
then it kinda helps with the
long struggle that it takes.

1236
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:37,970
- [Sreenivasan] When we met Dr. Jupiter,

1237
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:39,640
he had his monogrammed jacket on,

1238
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,490
which he took off for our interview,

1239
00:48:41,490 --> 00:48:43,050
but he explained how he normally wears

1240
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:44,810
the jacket in the hospital because

1241
00:48:44,810 --> 00:48:47,220
it is one more visual cue to patients

1242
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:49,030
that he is a physician,

1243
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:51,010
something he says people
don't always expect

1244
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:52,520
from a young black male.

1245
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:53,400
- [Sreenivasan] Have you been mistaken

1246
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,520
for something other than a doctor?

1247
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:55,502
- All the time.

1248
00:48:55,502 --> 00:48:56,480
(laughing)

1249
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,313
It happens.

1250
00:48:57,313 --> 00:48:58,540
I don't think it's intentional.

1251
00:48:58,540 --> 00:48:59,960
I would like to think
it's not intentional,

1252
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,820
but it's very rare that
you can walk into a room

1253
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:04,570
as a patient and when you see

1254
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:08,533
a Black, African-American
male with dreads in his hair,

1255
00:49:08,533 --> 00:49:11,440
that this is my doctor until you

1256
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,421
formally introduce yourself,

1257
00:49:12,421 --> 00:49:14,231
or you will get the comments.

1258
00:49:14,231 --> 00:49:17,790
Nurse, or can you get this for me,

1259
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:20,431
or are you here to clean
the room, so to speak,

1260
00:49:20,431 --> 00:49:23,640
those things have all happened.

1261
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:24,710
- [Sreenivasan] Students at Xavier hope

1262
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:26,250
to change those stereotypes.

1263
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:29,810
- We all recognize that
people don't truly see us

1264
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:31,640
for who we are, and we use that

1265
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,810
to motivate ourselves and
to try to show people,

1266
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:36,710
we're a lot more than
what you take us for.

1267
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:39,480
- As African-Americans, we're
known to be great at sports,

1268
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:42,280
but we can be so much
greater in other areas,

1269
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,581
and I just feel like we
need to be more represented.

1270
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:47,290
(jazzy music)

1271
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:48,123
- [Sreenivasan] There's a bright spot

1272
00:49:48,123 --> 00:49:49,970
for minority trends in the field.

1273
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:51,470
The number of Black women applying

1274
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:53,530
to medical school is on the rise.

1275
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:55,730
- Black women have something to prove.

1276
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:57,180
- [Sreenivasan] Xavier
sophomore Rachel Hitchens

1277
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:58,540
has already been accepted into the

1278
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:00,490
University of Rochester medical school.

1279
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:03,021
- We've been objectified
for so many years.

1280
00:50:03,021 --> 00:50:08,021
We have to prove that we can
be more than video dancers.

1281
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:11,700
We can actually use our brain,

1282
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:15,000
and I think that is,
that's the motivating force

1283
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,373
that's deep down within so
many Black women like myself.

1284
00:50:18,373 --> 00:50:20,770
- [Sreenivasan] And like
Hitchens, the students we spoke to

1285
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:23,750
at this small New Orleans
college had big plans.

1286
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:25,530
- I want to be an orthopedic surgeon.

1287
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:27,670
- I want to be a pediatric cardiologist.

1288
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:31,402
- I want to be a rural
family practice physician.

1289
00:50:31,402 --> 00:50:33,720
- [Sreenivasan] Paving the
way for another generation

1290
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,510
of African-American doctors.

1291
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:37,130
In New Orleans, for the PBS NewsHour,

1292
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:38,901
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

1293
00:50:38,901 --> 00:50:41,484
(upbeat music)

1294
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:50,380
- Finally tonight, a
generous journalism prize

1295
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:53,840
was awarded by the
Heising Simons Foundation.

1296
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,850
The American Mosaic Prize is given

1297
00:50:55,850 --> 00:50:59,230
to two freelance journalists
for long-form reporting

1298
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:01,210
that highlights underrepresented groups

1299
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:02,750
in the American landscape.

1300
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:05,230
The two recipients this
year are Abe Streep

1301
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:07,830
and Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah, whose work

1302
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:10,510
also received the
Pulitzer Prize last year.

1303
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:13,980
Ghansah was featured in our
Brief but Spectacular series

1304
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:17,820
in 2016, and so we
bring that to you again,

1305
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:19,870
and we congratulate her and
Abe Streep for this honor

1306
00:51:19,870 --> 00:51:23,973
with encouragement to continue
doing meaningful journalism.

1307
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:26,440
- I like writing about
people who look like me

1308
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:29,210
and the people I know who don't

1309
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:31,200
have good pieces written about them,

1310
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,781
because we deserve it.

1311
00:51:32,781 --> 00:51:34,391
(clapping)

1312
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:37,058
(serious music)

1313
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:42,430
I've written about Jimi
Hendrix, Electric Lady Studios,

1314
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:43,430
Toni Morrison,

1315
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:44,350
Kendrick Lamar,

1316
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:45,410
the Watts riots,

1317
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:46,340
Trayvon Martin,

1318
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:47,370
Rachel Jeantel,

1319
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:48,610
Dave Chappelle.

1320
00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:50,653
We don't always hear about the people

1321
00:51:50,653 --> 00:51:53,630
who we know as legends, the ways that

1322
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:55,000
they were very true to themselves.

1323
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,520
I'm more interested in the moments

1324
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,100
when they were uncompromising

1325
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:00,250
and they were fearless because what I hope

1326
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:02,580
is that that fearlessness tells us

1327
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:04,950
a little bit about how we can be fearless.

1328
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:06,640
What was interesting to
me about Dave Chappelle

1329
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,340
was that here's a moment where

1330
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:10,682
typically walking away
from Comedy Central,

1331
00:52:10,682 --> 00:52:14,180
walking away from your career
would be a bad decision,

1332
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:16,190
and anyone would tell you don't do that.

1333
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:19,940
The common understanding
of it is is that he felt

1334
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:21,800
that the show had
started to cross the line

1335
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:25,020
and that it was actually becoming
a source of embarrassment,

1336
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:28,090
and so walking away from $50 million

1337
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:31,890
was pretty heroic and pretty
decent and full of integrity.

1338
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:33,933
Well, you know, I couldn't
read until I was 12.

1339
00:52:33,933 --> 00:52:36,660
Maybe I wasn't 12, but I was older.

1340
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:38,570
I think people start reading
when they're five or something,

1341
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:42,790
and so books were kind of
this phantasmagorical space

1342
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:45,630
that I couldn't enter
because my mom could read,

1343
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:48,080
my dad was an academic,
everyone was so intelligent,

1344
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:51,000
and I couldn't go there,
and the moment I could,

1345
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,870
I just started to read ravenously.

1346
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:54,741
One of the books that I remember

1347
00:52:54,741 --> 00:52:59,010
changing everyone's lives was Beloved.

1348
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:02,021
That was the first time
people who had been silenced,

1349
00:53:02,021 --> 00:53:07,021
enslaved people became
human, and at that moment

1350
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:10,293
I said, this is what a
writer can do and so for me,

1351
00:53:10,293 --> 00:53:13,570
Toni Morrison doesn't
exist on a human plane.

1352
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:17,890
She almost exists in this
odd, spiritual other world

1353
00:53:17,890 --> 00:53:22,690
in terms of her work, and
when she won that Nobel Prize,

1354
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:23,842
what was interesting is that

1355
00:53:23,842 --> 00:53:27,830
a lot of prominent newspapers asked,

1356
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:28,922
does this woman deserve it?

1357
00:53:28,922 --> 00:53:30,773
So when I had the moment to take

1358
00:53:30,773 --> 00:53:33,589
the New York Times Magazine cover,

1359
00:53:33,589 --> 00:53:35,670
I decided I'm gonna take that cover

1360
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:37,640
to lay flowers at the feet of this woman

1361
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:41,338
and say not only did you
deserve it, but thank you.

1362
00:53:41,338 --> 00:53:43,640
My name is Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah,

1363
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:46,122
and this is my brief but spectacular take

1364
00:53:46,122 --> 00:53:48,413
on fearlessness and black art.

1365
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:51,040
