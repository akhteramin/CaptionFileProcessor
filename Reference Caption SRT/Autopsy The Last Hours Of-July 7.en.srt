1
00:00:00,074 --> 00:00:03,543
- [Narrator] And did they have
an impact on people's lives?

2
00:00:04,591 --> 00:00:08,350
- One of the most important
bands to ever walk the Earth.

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:11,230
Their influence will never, ever go away.

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:14,960
- They had the perfect
combination with a classic lineup.

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,060
They had the personalities
that could create friction,

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,220
but created great music.

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,740
And they don't come along very often.

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,120
- It was just a giant firework display,

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,930
that was just the best you've ever seen.

10
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:30,630
But it wasn't built to last.

11
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,621
It exploded into the sky and we all went,

12
00:00:32,621 --> 00:00:36,538
"Aah!", and it was gone, fabulous.

13
00:00:40,027 --> 00:00:45,027
(foreboding ambient music)
(siren wails)

14
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,680
- We have a death.

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,240
We need to confirm identification,

16
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,750
and then we need to perform an autopsy.

17
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,860
- The lead singer of the rock
band, Nirvana, Kurt Cobain,

18
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,153
has died of a gunshot wound in Seattle.

19
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,730
- [Narrator] The world was
stunned when Kurt Cobain,

20
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:05,860
the 27-year old musician and
self-styled prince of grunge,

21
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:06,953
was found dead.

22
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,690
- Kurt Cobain was a genius,

23
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:13,630
he was the powerful voice of a generation.

24
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,230
- He was the true artist,

25
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,333
even in his pain he was genuine.

26
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,570
- [Narrator] But with
success came pressures,

27
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,940
that Kurt found hard to handle.

28
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:26,650
- He worked so hard to become
the millionaire rockstar,

29
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,939
and then once he did, he
didn't like it very much.

30
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:30,772
(glass smashes)

31
00:01:30,772 --> 00:01:33,340
- [Narrator] And on April 8th, 1994,

32
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,910
when Kurt Cobain was found
dead at his Seattle mansion,

33
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:40,500
it appeared to be a
clear-cut case of suicide.

34
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,640
- Kurt was the poster boy for suicide.

35
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,623
I said he's going to kill himself.

36
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,310
- [Narrator] But despite
leaving a suicide note,

37
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,010
many people refused to
believe that Kurt Cobain

38
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:53,733
had taken his own life.

39
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,573
- I knew from the beginning
that Kurt had been murdered.

40
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,320
- Kurt Cobain's death
certificate says that he died

41
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,517
from a single shotgun wound to the head.

42
00:02:06,517 --> 00:02:08,930
But why would a man who's just achieved

43
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,690
his lifelong goal of becoming a rockstar,

44
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,220
and starting a family, kill himself?

45
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,633
And could foul play have been involved?

46
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:22,273
(dramatic symphonic music)

47
00:02:26,497 --> 00:02:28,250
(suspenseful music)

48
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,440
- [Narrator] Dr. Michael Hunter is

49
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,050
a world-renowned forensic pathologist,

50
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,660
and the chief medical examiner

51
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,623
in one of America's biggest cities.

52
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:40,300
He's performed over 4000 autopsies,

53
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,013
to investigate and reveal
the cause of death.

54
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,860
- Kurt Cobain's investigative
records show that he died

55
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,603
from a shotgun wound to the
head, fired through the mouth.

56
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,570
But why would a man who has
struggled to make it a musician,

57
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,883
and who'd just started
a family kill himself?

58
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,110
I'm gonna use all the available
evidence to investigate

59
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:07,110
what happened to Kurt both
mentally and physically,

60
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,913
and discover more about why he died.

61
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:18,330
(suspenseful music)

62
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:22,203
- [Narrator] April 1st, 1994, 2:30pm.

63
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,023
Four days before Kurt Cobain's death.

64
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,373
Kurt is at the Exodus Recovery
Center in Marina Del Rey.

65
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,500
He's trying to kick the heroin addiction

66
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,813
he's developed since becoming a rockstar.

67
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,860
- One of the people he smoked
a cigarette with outside,

68
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,250
said that Kurt just seemed
like a happy-go-lucky guy,

69
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,475
he didn't seem like he had
a problem in the world.

70
00:03:46,475 --> 00:03:48,613
He seemed very excited about life.

71
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,690
- [Narrator] Kurt had only
recently become a millionaire,

72
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,530
after a lifetime of financial hardship,

73
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,560
and had just bought himself a mansion

74
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,900
in an exclusive area of Seattle,

75
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,680
where he lived with his
wife, Courtney Love,

76
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,293
and his 19-month old baby, Frances Bean.

77
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,950
In a recently discovered interview,

78
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,400
recorded a few months before his death,

79
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,763
Kurt claimed he'd never been happier.

80
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,690
- [Kurt's Voice] Ever
since I've been married

81
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,690
and I've had a child,
within the last year,

82
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,840
everything, my whole mental
state and my physical state

83
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:27,120
has been, it's just almost improved 100%.

84
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,323
I've never been more optimistic.

85
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,820
- But within five days of appearing

86
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,230
optimistic about the future,
Kurt Cobain was dead.

87
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:39,640
He was 27, and he joins
a long list of stars

88
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,060
who died at this age.

89
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:46,060
Including Jim Morrison, Jimi
Hendrix, and Amy Winehouse.

90
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,653
It's an exclusive club,

91
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:53,253
and I want to find out
what led Kurt to doing it.

92
00:04:56,242 --> 00:04:58,370
(bright ambient music)

93
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,170
- [Narrator] Kurt Donald Cobain,

94
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:04,780
was born on February
20th, 1967, in Aberdeen,

95
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:08,393
a small industrial town located
two hours south of Seattle.

96
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,020
- Aberdeen was a logging town
where everybody was macho.

97
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,970
He certainly wasn't the
type who was gonna go out

98
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:19,793
and cut down trees.

99
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,830
- [Narrator] Kurt's dad was a mechanic,

100
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,840
and his mother was a waitress,

101
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,690
but his upbringing was far from easy.

102
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,510
- The whole Cobain
family was dysfunctional.

103
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,407
I'm talking all of us.

104
00:05:32,407 --> 00:05:34,840
- Where you going tonight?
- Oh, working late.

105
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,030
- The dysfunctional part I think
was that he was living with

106
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:43,401
parents who were using
more alcohol than normal.

107
00:05:43,401 --> 00:05:45,310
(parents arguing)
(rising symphonic music)

108
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:48,880
And it's hard for you to
be a happy little kid,

109
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,960
if you're growing up in
a family that's fighting

110
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,083
and don't really know
how to raise children.

111
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,960
- [Kurt's Voice] I was
ashamed of my parents.

112
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,873
I couldn't face some of
my friends at school,

113
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,537
because I desperately wanted to have

114
00:06:04,537 --> 00:06:08,660
the classic typical
family, mother, father,

115
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,993
I wanted that security.

116
00:06:10,931 --> 00:06:12,440
(young Kurt playing guitar)

117
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,550
- [Narrator] Kurt's parents
separated when he was nine.

118
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,490
He found solace in music,

119
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:20,280
which he showed promise
at from an early age.

120
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,790
- He was a child prodigy
who possessed this rare,

121
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,020
unique artistic talent.

122
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,910
- Music saved Kurt,

123
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:32,760
I think it was the only way he
knew to express his feelings.

124
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,210
And I really do think it
was therapeutic for him.

125
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,560
- [Narrator] Kurt started
by playing the drums

126
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,240
before moving on to guitar.
(deep music)

127
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,430
But it wasn't until he was 18,

128
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,220
that he met Krist Novoselic,

129
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,893
and formed the band, Nirvana.

130
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,500
It was Kurt's approach that
would be at the forefront

131
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,233
of a new style of music.

132
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,960
- How he was able to take punk music,

133
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,100
old rock and roll,
minimalist melodic music,

134
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,280
stick it all in a soup,

135
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,770
and come out with what he came out with,

136
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:08,100
I think that was pretty revolutionary.

137
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,630
- [Narrator] This fusion of rock and punk,

138
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,603
became known as grunge.

139
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,917
It is epitomized in their iconic track,

140
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:18,727
"Smells Like Teen Spirit".

141

146
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:42,490
Nirvana's album, Nevermind,
released in 1991,

147
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,230
went to the top of the
charts around the world,

148
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,850
and established Kurt Cobain

149
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:49,323
as the biggest rockstar of his generation.

150
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,130
In February 1992, Kurt
married the former stripper

151
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:58,483
and lead singer of the
band, Hole, Courtney Love.

152
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,260
- As soon as she married him,

153
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,480
I listened to a lot of his poetry,

154
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,890
and a lot of his music and I thought,

155
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,490
well this guy's pretty profound.

156
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:11,510
- I think he was popular
because he was wounded,

157
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,840
he looked like a person who

158
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,550
was down on his luck and rebellious.

159
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,543
Yeah so I think the kids
could really relate to that.

160
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,480
- He spoke to this lost generation,

161
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,406
and became the voice of the generation.

162
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:27,820
(light ambient music)

163
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,470
- This is a photograph of Nirvana,

164
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:33,120
taken six months prior
to Kurt Cobain's death,

165
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,110
and I'm surprised at how small Kurt is.

166
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:38,590
Bass guitarist, Krist Novoselic,

167
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:42,410
is incredibly tall, at
six foot six inches.

168
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:45,323
And drummer David Grohl, is six feet tall.

169
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,900
According to his records,
Kurt was five nine,

170
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,243
but looked considerably smaller.

171
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:56,780
This could be due to a disorder
that he was suffering from,

172
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:01,600
called scoliosis, and in this
recently discovered interview,

173
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,450
Kurt sheds new light on what

174
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,323
he thought caused this condition.

175
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,580
- [Kurt's Voice] I had scoliosis
when I was in junior high,

176
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,250
and I've been playing guitar ever since,

177
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,170
and the weight of the guitar has made

178
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:16,960
my back grow in this curvature,

179
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,843
so when I stand, you know,
everything's sideways.

180
00:09:21,418 --> 00:09:23,540
(suspenseful music)

181
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,240
- [Dr. Hunter] Scoliosis,
or curvature of the spine,

182
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,090
occurs in about 3% of people,

183
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:32,940
and most commonly arises
in the teenage years.

184
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,520
The curve is usually either
S-shaped with two bends,

185
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,993
or C-shaped with one.

186
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,750
- His music felt like
he was always in pain,

187
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,510
that he was angst-ridden,

188
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:48,720
and that's a typical
reflection of the scoliosis

189
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,013
that he battled with.

190
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,450
- It's a common misconception
that scoliosis causes pain,

191
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:58,210
but that is not always the case,

192
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:01,593
and the cause is oftentimes unknown.

193
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,140
This is an x-ray of Kurt Cobain's spine,

194
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,873
and it shows that he
has C-shaped scoliosis.

195
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:13,420
This wouldn't be caused by
the weight of his guitar,

196
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,194
but it could be exacerbated by it.

197
00:10:16,194 --> 00:10:17,620
(dramatic symphonic music)

198
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,230
As there is no mention of any pain,

199
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:24,100
or psychological distress
associated with this condition,

200
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,203
I don't believe that this is
responsible for his death.

201
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,800
However, Kurt did suffer from another

202
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,180
long-standing medical condition,

203
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:37,020
that had a huge impact on him.

204
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,760
So I want to investigate whether

205
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,523
it led him to take his own life.

206
00:10:44,136 --> 00:10:45,230
(light piano music)

207
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,770
- I remember putting on a brave face

208
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,260
to hide my symptoms of depression.

209
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,090
I was on an anti-depressant,

210
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,233
but I still had depression symptoms.

211
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:56,240
It was tough getting through the day,

212
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,633
hiding how I really felt.

213
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:01,030
Something had to change.

214
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,650
So I talked to my doctor for real,

215
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:06,200
no more saying, "Oh, I'm fine".

216
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,030
This time, I spoke up about
living behind the mask,

217
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,050
and he told me about Rexulti.

218
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,950
He said that Rexulti, when
added to an anti-depressant,

219
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:18,080
has been proven to help
reduce symptoms of depression,

220
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,010
without giving up the
progress I may have made

221
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,760
on my anti-depressant.

222
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,780
- [Narrator] Rexulti is not for everyone.

223
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:26,430
Call your doctor about
unusual changes in behavior,

224
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:29,510
worsening depression,
or thoughts of suicide.

225
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:32,540
Anti-depressants can increase
these in those 24 and younger.

226
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,710
Elderly dementia patients taking Rexulti

227
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,930
have an increased risk of death or stroke.

228
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,860
Call your doctor if you have high fever,

229
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,380
stiff muscles and confusion,

230
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,760
to address a possible
life-threatening condition,

231
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,590
or if you have uncontrollable
muscle movements,

232
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,170
as these may be permanent.

233
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,900
Rexulti has been shown to increase

234
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,420
blood sugar in some people.

235
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:52,250
Other risks are increased
cholesterol, weight gain,

236
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,490
unusual urges or compulsive behaviors,

237
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,270
decreased white blood
cells, which can be serious,

238
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:00,330
dizziness on standing,
seizures, trouble swallowing,

239
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,430
and impaired judgment or motor skills.

240
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,930
- It was time to make a change.

241
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,683
That's why I asked my
doctor about adding Rexulti.

319
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,050
is examining all the
medical evidence available,

320
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,250
to try and work out if and why

321
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,560
Kurt Cobain took his own life.

322
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,090
- Suicides are rarely
down to just one factor.

323
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,150
They're oftentimes a mixture of both

324
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:25,400
physical and psychological conditions.

325
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,050
So I want to dig deeper to find out

326
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:30,747
what precipitated his death.

327
00:15:30,747 --> 00:15:32,800
(light symphonic music)

328
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,340
- [Narrator] March 3rd, 1994, 11:30pm.

329
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,223
The Excelsior Hotel, Rome.

330
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,613
One month before Kurt Cobain's death.

331
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:49,493
Kurt has arrived in Rome to
meet his wife, Courtney Love.

332
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,010
He's just pulled out of
Nirvana's European tour,

333
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:55,773
blaming it on bronchitis.

334
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,450
Kurt's relationship with
Courtney is also suffering,

335
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:03,550
with rumors of divorce.

336
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,290
But despite their problems,

337
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:08,840
they leave their daughter
Frances Bean with their nanny,

338
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,973
and spend the evening
drinking champagne together.

339
00:16:12,956 --> 00:16:13,789
- [Courtney] You need to
do what you need to do.

340
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:16,620
- Champagne's a very un-Kurtlike drink.

341
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,280
He wasn't really a big
drinker at the best of times.

342
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,570
Champagne is more of a rockstar drink,

343
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,430
and he wasn't into that.

344
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,590
- Excuse me?
- The couple drink

345
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:29,273
into the early hours
before they fall asleep.

346
00:16:30,518 --> 00:16:33,800
(soft rock music)
(skies thundering)

347
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,420
At 6:25am, Courtney wakes to find Kurt

348
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,708
is no longer beside her.

349
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:44,010
(clock ticks)
(foreboding music)

350
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:44,843
- Kurt?

351
00:16:46,838 --> 00:16:48,183
Kurt, come on wake up.

352
00:16:49,696 --> 00:16:51,730
I said wake up!
- When she fails to wake him,

353
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:52,783
she calls for help.

354
00:16:55,334 --> 00:16:57,296
(Courtney dialing phone)

355
00:16:57,296 --> 00:16:58,160
- Hello?
(dramatic music)

356
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,598
Yeah, I need an ambulance.

357
00:16:59,598 --> 00:17:02,293
(paramedic knocks on door)

358
00:17:02,293 --> 00:17:05,453
- [Narrator] At 6:40am,
a paramedic arrives.

359
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:10,080
When he also fails to revive Kurt,

360
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,050
he's taken to the Umberto I hospital,

361
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:15,280
less than two miles away.

362
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,880
- I listened to the news,

363
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,930
and they said that Courtney
had found Kurt unconscious,

364
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:24,150
and blue, which to me means,

365
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:27,730
that's like the color of death.

366
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:31,163
I just thought this guy is
a poster boy for suicide.

367
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,660
I went to his grandfather, Leland,

368
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:38,550
and I told him I was really,
really worried about Kurt.

369
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:40,320
I said you've got to talk to him,

370
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,873
he's going to kill himself.

371
00:17:43,456 --> 00:17:44,720
(nervy music)

372
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,140
- [Narrator] It was later revealed that

373
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,430
Kurt had left a suicide note.

374
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:51,700
He had admitted in many
interviews to using heroin,

375
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,573
but had in fact overdosed on Rohypnol.

376
00:17:56,765 --> 00:17:58,370
- Rohypnol is a tranquilizer,

377
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:01,140
also known as the "Date-Rape Drug",

378
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,113
but it's also prescribed
to treat heroin withdrawal.

379
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,530
A month later, Kurt was dead,

380
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:12,280
leaving little clue if and
why he took his own life.

381
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,600
But in a note found at
the scene, Kurt mentions,

382
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,690
and I quote, his burning nauseous stomach,

383
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:22,490
and this is a reference to
the chronic stomach pain,

384
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:27,260
that was so debilitating that
he said it blighted his life.

385
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,420
So could this be the reason

386
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,860
that he attempted suicide in Rome,

387
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,583
and finally took his life a month later?

388
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:38,914
(ambient piano music)

389
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,270
- [Narrator] Kurt's parents' marriage,

390
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,483
started to collapse when Kurt was seven.

391
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,840
By the time he was
nine, and they divorced,

392
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,803
their breakup was having a
devastating effect on him.

393
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,040
- When his parents split,
he started to change.

394
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,943
Because for any kid, it's not easy.

395
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,533
And that's sort of when the
stomach pain first surfaced.

396
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,170
- He had stomach problems
from an early age,

397
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,833
and it wasn't diagnosed.

398
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,330
- If you look at any of the sort of

399
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,710
the seminal moments in his life,

400
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,763
that stomach pain was there.

401
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:26,470
It may very well have been that

402
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:29,100
part of his condition was psychosomatic,

403
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,970
we know that being in emotional turmoil,

404
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:34,690
makes physical pain feel worse.

405
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,130
So it wouldn't be shocking to assume that

406
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:40,123
his mental state did
affect his physical state.

407
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:45,050
- It haunted him because he
couldn't function properly,

408
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,270
in everyday life.
(rising string music)

409
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:52,270
He really felt that unless he
got rid of the stomach pain,

410
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,893
basically life was over.

411
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,540
- I can see from Kurt's records,

412
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:00,690
that he was treated for
his stomach condition,

413
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:03,780
and he also had three
endoscopic procedures,

414
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:07,343
to try to determine precisely
the cause of his pain.

415
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,740
An endoscopy is where a
small camera is inserted

416
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,600
through the mouth and then
moved down the throat,

417
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,190
into the esophagus, stomach,

418
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,910
and upper-gastrointestinal tract.

419
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:23,260
The camera relays the
images back to the screen,

420
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:27,693
where the doctor can see inside
the body in great detail.

421
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:30,590
- [Narrator] But despite having

422
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:33,260
three endoscopic examinations,

423
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,540
the doctors could find no explanation

424
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,700
for Kurt's chronic stomach pain,

425
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,063
leading him to speculate on its causes.

426
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,520
- [Kurt's Voice] The reason
I've gotta endoscope,

427
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,073
they find a red irritation in my stomach,

428
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:50,570
it's just psychosomatic, that's all,

429
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:52,840
from anger and screaming,

430
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,827
I mean my mom had it when
she was in her early 20's,

431
00:20:55,827 --> 00:20:58,400
for a few years and it
just eventually went away.

432
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,750
She was in the hospital
all the time because of it.

433
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,440
(fast-paced music)

434
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,330
- Stomach pain obviously
ran in the Cobain family.

435
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:11,800
But in Kurt's case it's
because of his scoliosis.

436
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,270
This condition can pinch abdominal nerves,

437
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,803
causing severe stomach pain.

438
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,450
In 1993, when it was discovered that this

439
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:25,140
was the reason for his abdominal pain,

440
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,980
a simple prescription appears to have

441
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,430
brought the condition under control.

442
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:33,773
So, I don't believe that this
is responsible for his death.

443
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:38,640
Kurt was a frequent heroin user,

444
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,720
and claimed that he took it
to treat his abdominal pain.

445
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,290
So I wanna investigate what role

446
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:47,233
this drug played in his death.

447
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,680
- [Narrator] Smashing Pumpkins.

448
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,570
- D'arcy and Billy were shouting
at each other all the time.

449
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:55,230
- In a lot of ways I mean this is like,

450
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:58,283
the completion of everything,
what was started is over.

and forensic pathologist,

534
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:46,480
Dr. Michael Hunter, is
examining all the available

535
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,260
medical evidence about the
death of the musical icon

536
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:52,610
and prince of grunge, Kurt Cobain.

537
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:55,100
He was found dead in his Seattle mansion,

538
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,983
with a gunshot wound to his head.

539
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,490
For over 20 years, controversy
has surrounded his death,

540
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:04,193
with many refusing to
believe it was suicide.

541
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:08,020
Now Dr. Hunter plans to
finally get to the bottom

542
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,633
of what really killed Kurt Cobain.

543
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:19,423
- When Kurt returned from
Rome, his heroin use increased.

544
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:25,160
He was using about $400
worth of heroin every day,

545
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,670
and that's $700 in today's prices.

546
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,780
This is an enormous amount of heroin

547
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,800
to take on a daily basis,

548
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,130
and those who were close to him realized,

549
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:37,440
that if they didn't do something,

550
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,573
Kurt was going to die.

551
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:41,730
(light piano music)

552
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:44,390
- [Narrator] March 25th, 1994,

553
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:47,550
11:15am, Seattle, Washington,

554
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:50,053
10 days before Kurt Cobain's death.

555
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,660
Kurt walks into his living room,

556
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,868
having just injected heroin.

557
00:26:55,868 --> 00:26:57,840
- What's this?
- And gets a surprise.

558
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,200
- We need a change.

559
00:27:00,127 --> 00:27:01,060
- Change?

560
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,170
- An intervention was organized

561
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:06,640
by his entertainment
attorney, Rosemary Carroll,

562
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,630
and her husband, Danny Goldberg,

563
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:11,020
several of his closest people were there,

564
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:14,350
including his best friends.
- We care about you, dude.

565
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:16,860
- They thought Kurt was in a dark zone,

566
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,240
they thought he was doing too much heroin.

567
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,356
(rising music)
(Kurt argues)

568
00:27:20,356 --> 00:27:22,460
- [Narrator] But the
intervention backfires.

569
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:25,610
With Kurt accusing his
friends of being hypocrites,

570
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:29,170
for also using drugs while
telling him to stop taking them.

571
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:31,080
- Yeah it is, no we do drugs,

572
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,123
we play guitar, we play--
- I'm not talking about a bit

573
00:27:33,123 --> 00:27:34,790
of party coke I'm talking about
life and death, all right?

574
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,860
I'm taking about a baby, yes.

575
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,730
- Tell me I'm wrong.
- It's pretty hard,

576
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:41,530
for somebody to tell a drug-user,

577
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:43,310
that they shouldn't be using it.

578
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:45,823
Because that's where
they find their peace.

579
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:48,990
And I'm sure he did
not want to stop using,

580
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:51,890
and that's one of the reasons
he got angry about it.

581
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:53,829
You know, "Don't tell me what to do".

582
00:27:53,829 --> 00:27:55,912
- This isn't fun anymore.

583
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:58,810
- [Narrator] By now Kurt's
excessive drug taking

584
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:01,760
has not only alienated all of his friends,

585
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,280
but his marriage to Courtney
is also on the rocks.

586
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,330
- Hypocrites, hypocrites, hypocrites!

587
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:10,040
Every single one of you, damn it!

588
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,110
(Kurt slams door)

589
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:14,410
- I believe that Kurt's adverse
reaction to the intervention

590
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:17,583
is because he didn't see
himself as a drug addict.

591
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:22,640
He claims he was using
heroin not for enjoyment,

592
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,283
but for medicinal reasons.

593
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:28,217
- [Kurt's Voice] I've had this
stomach condition for years,

594
00:28:28,217 --> 00:28:30,740
and there were times
especially during touring,

595
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:34,810
and while off the tour where I
just felt like a drug addict,

596
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:36,180
because I was starving,

597
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,220
and I went to all these different doctors,

598
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,860
and they couldn't find out
what was wrong with me,

599
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,770
and I tried everything.

600
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:43,600
Nothing worked and I just decided that

601
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,290
if I'm going to feel like
a junkie every morning,

602
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:49,930
and be vomiting every day
then I may as well, you know,

603
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:52,583
take a substance that kills that pain.

604
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:56,200
- Kurt initially got into heroin,

605
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,553
because it seemed to
him to be a painkiller.

606
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,880
His whole teenage years he was looking

607
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,820
for various pills and prescriptions,

608
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:10,243
to help get over his bad
back, his bad stomach.

609
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:14,690
- I think the idea of
taking a drug to escape pain

610
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:16,970
is something that one hears very often.

611
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:19,090
And while that is kind of,

612
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,750
I guess understandable in the short term,

613
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:24,653
it doesn't negate the fact
that it's still a choice.

614
00:29:25,922 --> 00:29:26,755
And the excuse of,

615
00:29:26,755 --> 00:29:29,110
well I had no choice
because I was in pain,

616
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:32,063
is one that again, you hear
a lot of addicts using.

617
00:29:33,262 --> 00:29:34,710
(foreboding music)

618
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:37,300
- Kurt's explanation that he used heroin

619
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:40,280
for pain relief may be true.

620
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,480
But the damage that that drug caused

621
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,573
far outweighed any conceived benefit.

622
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,990
But I found something
else in Kurt's background,

623
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:52,963
that might also explain his
reliance on chemical stimulants.

624
00:29:53,928 --> 00:29:55,040
(ambient piano music)
(young Kurt drumming)

625
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:58,070
- [Narrator] In 1974, aged seven,

626
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:02,140
Kurt's manic behavior worried
his parents to such an extent,

627
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:05,100
that he is taken to the
doctor's where he's diagnosed

628
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:10,100
with attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD,

629
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,623
and prescribed the drug, Ritalin.

630
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:16,720
- Here you had an artistic kid,

631
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,370
who's a little bit
different to begin with,

632
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:20,530
and wants to rather draw than do his math,

633
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:21,733
and that sort of thing.

634
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:26,400
He may be acting out a bit
because of his home life,

635
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,723
so they did put him on Ritalin.

636
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,760
- Ritalin is the common name
for the drug, methylphenidate.

637
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,940
And it's classified by the Drug
Enforcement Administration,

638
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:42,280
as a schedule two drug, in the
same classification as say,

639
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:46,470
cocaine, morphine, and amphetamines.

640
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,860
Ritalin works by increasing the activity

641
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:51,910
of the chemicals dopamine,
and noradrenaline,

642
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:53,990
in areas of the brain that play a part

643
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:56,663
in controlling attention and behavior.

644
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,620
- He was first prescribed Ritalin,

645
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:03,180
and you can see that
that might have started

646
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:06,730
a lifetime habit of
relying on various drugs

647
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:08,563
to balance his mood out.

648
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:12,720
Along with the Ritalin
there came sleeping pills,

649
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,920
because he couldn't
sometimes go to bed at night,

650
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:19,300
even as a youngster, so
already you can begin to see,

651
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:22,390
where there's a certain
amount of chemical assistance

652
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:24,960
going on just to get him through the day.

653
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,940
- [Narrator] After his parents' divorce,

654
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,710
Kurt stayed with each of them,

655
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:33,020
but following continual arguments
both asked him to leave.

656
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:36,330
At 15 years old, Kurt Cobain was homeless,

657
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:39,173
and his ADHD was going untreated.

658
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:43,820
Over the next four years
Kurt had 10 different homes,

659
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,880
he would stay at friends'
houses and sleep in hallways,

660
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,693
abandoned properties, or under a bridge.

661
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:53,080
As Kurt increasingly
dropped out of society,

662
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,640
he had run-ins with the law,

663
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,393
and was arrested for vandalism.

664
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:00,870
For a decade, his ADHD went untreated,

665
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:03,923
and his addiction to heroin
reached dangerous levels.

666
00:32:05,135 --> 00:32:07,300
(dramatic percussive music)

667
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,080
- There is no evidence to suggest that

668
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:12,230
Ritalin itself leads to addiction.

669
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:16,570
But, children with ADHD
are two to three times

670
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:20,583
more likely to have substance
abuse issues later in life.

671
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:25,630
But after a lifetime of
relying on drugs to treat pain,

672
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:27,690
and to alter his moods,

673
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:30,210
Kurt finally agrees to seek treatment

674
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:31,610
for his addiction to heroin.

675
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:34,640
(suspenseful music)

676
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,750
- [Narrator] April 1st, 1994, 4:30pm.

677
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,023
Four days before Kurt Cobain's death.

678
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:46,833
Kurt has been at the Exodus
Recovery Center for 24 hours.

679
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,500
But despite his promise to
seek help for his addiction,

680
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,573
he decides he doesn't want to
continue with the treatment.

681
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,570
- The problem with the Exodus Center

682
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:01,770
is there's no physical constraint
to keep the person there

683
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:04,210
if he doesn't want to be there.

684
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:07,710
- Kurt climbed over a wall
because he missed his daughter,

685
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,470
several of his close friends,

686
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:12,710
he felt it was the time to restart life.

687
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:14,800
- [Narrator] But Kurt's cousin, Beverly,

688
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:18,630
thinks he fled rehab for
very different reasons.

689
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:21,920
There was a chance that he
could have been really helped

690
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,810
in that facility but he
apparently did not want

691
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:27,924
to stop using heroin.

692
00:33:27,924 --> 00:33:30,236
(suspenseful music)

693
00:33:30,236 --> 00:33:32,280
- It may very well have
been that the prospect

694
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,437
of coming off heroin was scary for Kurt.

695
00:33:34,437 --> 00:33:37,890
You know, this was one
of his coping mechanisms.

696
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,170
This was one of the tools that

697
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:41,130
helped get him through the day,

698
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:43,240
in his mind this was one of the tools,

699
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,650
that kept the pain away,
that helped the creativity,

700
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:49,890
that kept him stable in some ways.

701
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:52,140
So I think one of the biggest barriers

702
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,640
to him actually seeking
the help that he did,

703
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,010
may have been this fear
of what it was like

704
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:58,513
to live without the heroin.

705
00:34:00,855 --> 00:34:02,240
(fast-paced music)

706
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,960
- I can see from the report
that drug paraphernalia

707
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,120
was found at the scene of Kurt's death.

708
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,420
He also had a blood morphine level

709
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:13,940
of 1.52 milligrams per liter,

710
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,873
and that is a tremendous amount.

711
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,070
So the question I have
is what happened to Kurt,

712
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:22,210
from the time that he left rehab,

713
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:24,965
and when he died four days later?

714
00:34:24,965 --> 00:34:26,090
(nervy percussive music)

715
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:30,250
- [Narrator] April 3rd, 1994, 2:21pm,

716
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:33,240
the Peninsula Hotel, Beverly Hills.

717
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,533
Two days before Kurt Cobain's death.

718
00:34:37,125 --> 00:34:38,862
- Would you like to slow down?

719
00:34:38,862 --> 00:34:40,410
- Well, my husband's gone missing.

720
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:43,450
- [Narrator] Private detective,
Tom Grant and his assistant,

721
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:45,573
are summoned by Kurt's wife, Courtney.

722
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:51,320
She tells him Kurt has fled
rehab and bought a shotgun,

723
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,042
and could be suicidal.

724
00:34:53,042 --> 00:34:54,707
- Really, really strange recently and--

725
00:34:54,707 --> 00:34:58,070
- Tom Grant was briefed to check around

726
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,220
for Kurt's whereabouts.

727
00:35:00,561 --> 00:35:03,523
He was meant to go to the house
in Seattle, and find Kurt.

728
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:10,307
- [Narrator] April 7th, 1994, 2:45am.

729
00:35:10,307 --> 00:35:11,770
- Kurt?
- Six days after

730
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:13,100
Kurt went missing--
- Hello?

731
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,170
- [Narrator] Private
investigator, Tom Grant,

732
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:19,400
searches his Seattle mansion,
but doesn't find him.

733
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,233
- Kurt?

734
00:35:21,556 --> 00:35:22,920
(percussive music)

735
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,100
- [Narrator] April 8th, 8:40am,

736
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:29,610
seven days after Kurt's
disappearance from rehab,

737
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:32,020
an electrician is
installing security lights

738
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:34,453
on the building above Kurt's garage.

739
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:40,660
- The private eye and the
others, the Seattle police,

740
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:44,510
had not thought to check
that particular building,

741
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:48,518
but Gary Smith, the
electrician went up there,

742
00:35:48,518 --> 00:35:51,980
and he saw Kurt's body lying on the floor.

743
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:54,260
(fast-paced music)

744
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,890
- [Narrator] The electrician
calls the police.

745
00:35:56,890 --> 00:36:00,483
At 9:00am, paramedic John
Fisk arrives at the property.

746
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,780
- When we arrived at the scene,

747
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:07,380
we did not know whose house it was.

748
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:11,333
We were directed by the police
officer up around the garage.

749
00:36:12,428 --> 00:36:14,770
I was probably the first
one to arrive at the door,

750
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:16,720
we could see a body laying inside,

751
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,243
with a gun evident in his lap.

752
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,360
I don't believe we could tell
whether it had just happened,

753
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,893
if he could still be alive.

754
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:27,110
I told the police officer we needed

755
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,580
to get in there right away,

756
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,610
indicating to him that I hoped

757
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:33,090
he would perform some forcible entry.

758
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:36,130
He felt that they needed
to wait for a supervisor,

759
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:37,729
we felt we didn't have the time.

760
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:40,396
(glass smashes)

761
00:36:42,807 --> 00:36:43,770
(door closes)

762
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:45,820
As we entered the room
and approached the body,

763
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,027
it was evident that he was dead,

764
00:36:47,027 --> 00:36:49,127
and there was nothing we could do for him.

765
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:52,230
It would appear that he had
been sitting on the floor

766
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:55,130
with his legs out and a
shotgun in between his legs,

767
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,730
and activated the trigger perhaps

768
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:57,960
with his thumb or something.

769
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,300
The wound was in his mouth,

770
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,570
and an exit wound to the
back-left side of his head.

771
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:05,280
His face wasn't badly
distorted or misshapen

772
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,933
like we often see with a
gunshot wound to the head.

773
00:37:09,912 --> 00:37:12,550
(light ambient music)

774
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:14,720
- We are working on a
presumptive identification,

775
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,330
but until we confirm
and notify the family,

776
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:18,887
we will not release the name.

777
00:37:18,887 --> 00:37:22,020
- The phone rang and it
was a newspaper reporter,

778
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,800
and he told me that
somebody had killed themself

779
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,620
in Kurt's garage.

780
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:30,487
And I said,

781
00:37:30,487 --> 00:37:33,560
"Well, it can't be Kurt
because he's in treatment."

782
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,347
And he said, "No, no, he
left there a few days ago."

783
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,370
I sort of put two and two together,

784
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:46,183
and I went to my knees and sobbed.

785
00:37:46,183 --> 00:37:48,480
(melancholy piano music)

786
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,660
- [Reporter] Kurt Cobain's
body was found inside

787
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:53,720
a garage apartment adjacent
to his Seattle home,

788
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,850
dead of an apparently
self-inflicted shotgun wound.

789
00:37:56,850 --> 00:38:01,550
- It came on the radio,
and I was really depressed.

790
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:04,260
You know, it immediately makes
you remember that person,

791
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,777
that tugged my arm at the show and said,

792
00:38:06,777 --> 00:38:08,150
"Hey, how you doing?",

793
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:10,670
just this cute little guy, you know?

794
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:15,100
Plus I was really enjoying
his music and imagining

795
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,513
how far he could take it.

796
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:23,300
- A post-mortem confirmed that Kurt Cobain

797
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,670
died from a single shot to the head,

798
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:28,300
by a 20-gauge Remington shotgun,

799
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:32,099
that he purchased only
eight days before he died.

800
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:32,970
(upbeat music)

801
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:34,230
- [Narrator] Kurt's body was found

802
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:36,440
to the left of the
greenhouse, on it's back,

803
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:39,030
with a shotgun laying on his chest.

804
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:41,280
The barrel had been placed in his mouth,

805
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,740
and the trigger pulled,

806
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:45,410
discharging hundreds of
small lead shot through

807
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:48,560
the roof of his mouth, and into his brain.

808
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,353
The damage was catastrophic.

809
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,980
- The single shot fired
in Kurt Cobain's mouth,

810
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:58,120
would have killed him instantly.

811
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,870
And given the fact that
there's a suicide note,

812
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:04,463
this appears to be an open and shut case.

813
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:07,330
- [Narrator] But since the death,

814
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:10,890
many have refused to
accept it was a suicide,

815
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,310
and believe Kurt was murdered.

816
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:15,630
They claim to have irrefutable evidence

817
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:17,143
that this is the case.

818
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,930
So could Kurt Cobain have
really been murdered?

819
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:23,793
And if so, by whom?

820
00:39:28,096 --> 00:39:31,179

The official verdict was that
he died as a result of suicide

from a gunshot wound to the head.

death was a suicide.

00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:02,214
to reveal the true cause of his death.

950
00:45:02,214 --> 00:45:03,900
(suspenseful music)

951
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,250
- Kurt Cobain's body lay undiscovered

952
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:08,850
for three days following his death.

953
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:11,550
And the autopsy revealed presence of

954
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:15,823
1.52 milligrams per liter
of morphine in the blood.

955
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:20,417
In the body, heroin
breaks down into morphine,

956
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:23,800
and this is an incredibly high level.

957
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:27,200
So some have argued that it is so high,

958
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,760
it would have been impossible
for Kurt to have the time

959
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,560
to shoot himself before passing out,

960
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,053
therefore foul play
must have been involved.

961
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:38,960
- [Narrator] One person who
believed that Kurt was murdered,

962
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,730
was the family member he was closest to,

963
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:43,283
his grandfather, Leland.

964
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,720
- He had so much dope in him that

965
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:51,213
he couldn't have possibly
brought that shotgun up.

966
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:55,253
And that's why I think he was murdered.

967
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:59,040
- [Narrator] Courtney
Love's estranged father

968
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,973
also believes Kurt was killed.

969
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:05,823
- I knew from the beginning,
maybe six months into it,

970
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:09,044
that Kurt had been murdered.

971
00:46:09,044 --> 00:46:12,377
(deep electronic music)

972
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:18,940
The little box that he had
had Mexican tar heroin in it.

973
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:22,040
You can't shoot up enough
Mexican tar heroin,

974
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,393
to get that much heroin
in your bloodstream.

975
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:27,237
All the junkies I've talked to said,

976
00:46:27,237 --> 00:46:30,057
"Oh no, that's absolutely impossible."

977
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:34,190
- [Narrator] More surprisingly,
Hank Harrison believes

978
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:37,340
his daughter could be
implicated in the murder.

979
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:39,730
He's had a tumultuous
relationship with Courtney

980
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:41,920
since his divorce from her mother,

981
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,850
and believes she had a
motive to want Kurt dead.

982
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:46,683
- There was a prenup,

983
00:46:46,683 --> 00:46:48,850
and she was only gonna get
a small amount of money,

984
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:51,060
and Kurt had already asked for a divorce,

985
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:53,090
and a change in the will.

986
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:55,620
- [Narrator] Investigative
journalist, Ian Halperin,

987
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:59,210
has been following the story
for more than 20 years.

988
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:03,110
- If Kurt died, she would
inherit the whole Cobain estate,

989
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:05,160
to the tune of a hundred million dollars.

990
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:07,590
And if they would have divorced,

991
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:09,150
she would have walked away with nothing

992
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:10,974
because of the prenup.

993
00:47:10,974 --> 00:47:12,090
(sparse ambient music)

994
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:14,470
- [Narrator] He also believes
that it would be impossible

995
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:16,240
for Kurt to shoot himself,

996
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,270
with such a high level
of heroin in his system,

997
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:21,070
and argues that there are other

998
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:23,520
highly suspicious inconsistencies,

999
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,453
surrounding Kurt Cobain's death.

1000
00:47:26,758 --> 00:47:27,950
(fast-paced music)

1001
00:47:27,950 --> 00:47:32,350
- Kurt's body was found
lying with the shotgun,

1002
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:35,223
whomever killed him had gloves on.

1003
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:39,313
There were no latent
fingerprints found on the gun.

1004
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:42,100
Dead men don't wipe their own prints.

1005
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:46,450
- [Narrator] It's also argued
there are inconsistencies

1006
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:48,573
in the handwriting on the suicide note.

1007
00:47:49,841 --> 00:47:52,960
- I hired the two top
handwriting experts in the world,

1008
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:57,250
to study the suicide
note and to dissect it,

1009
00:47:57,250 --> 00:48:00,380
and they said it was written
in two different handwritings.

1010
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:03,360
The top of the note was
written in Kurt's handwriting,

1011
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,710
and the bottom of the
note, the last five lines,

1012
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:07,400
which dealt with the suicide,

1013
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:10,191
was written in the
handwriting of somebody else.

1014
00:48:10,191 --> 00:48:11,460
(brooding electronic music)

1015
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:14,260
- [Narrator] And those that
believe Kurt was killed,

1016
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:16,500
think this is how it happened.

1017
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:20,220
- Kurt was assassinated but
he didn't die all at once.

1018
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:22,313
Whoever killed him did it in stages.

1019
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:26,813
First thing you do is
incapacitate the person,

1020
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:30,793
after he was knocked out with Rohypnol,

1021
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:36,540
he got shot up with what we think to be

1022
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:39,463
a massive dose of fentanyl.

1023
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:44,720
He died, they had to give him a shotgun,

1024
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:47,170
and shoot him to make it look like it was

1025
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:50,263
an absolute prima facie case of suicide.

1026
00:48:52,924 --> 00:48:55,591
(shotgun fires)

1027
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:05,420
- Fentanyl is a powerful
synthetic painkiller,

1028
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:09,770
similar to morphine, but
100 times more potent.

1029
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:12,200
And the autopsy also revealed the presence

1030
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,850
of a diazepam like substance,

1031
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:17,113
and this could possibly be Rohypnol.

1032
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:21,153
- The smoking gun is the heroin level.

1033
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:26,040
70 times the lethal dose
for the average person,

1034
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,640
three times for the most severe junkie,

1035
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,450
forensic pathological experts
say there's never been

1036
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:34,650
one case documented in
the history of humankind,

1037
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:37,083
with so much heroin in somebody's system.

1038
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:41,630
- Kurt did have an exceptionally
high level of heroin

1039
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:43,690
in his system when he died.

1040
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:46,353
But I believe there's
an explanation for this,

1041
00:49:46,353 --> 00:49:50,623
and the other factors people
point to as proof of foul play.

1042
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,540
After shotgun deaths, there
is a lot of blood loss,

1043
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:58,910
and the medical examiner
may only be able to

1044
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:01,660
get blood from the heart to sample.

1045
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:04,890
As Kurt shot himself soon
after injecting the heroin,

1046
00:50:04,890 --> 00:50:08,143
it hadn't had a chance to
distribute throughout his body.

1047
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:12,240
The veins drain directly into the heart,

1048
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:15,100
so the drug is concentrated there,

1049
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:17,633
giving a much higher reading than normal.

1050
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,990
The lack of fingerprints
can also be explained.

1051
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:26,320
The police report says that
they took four latent prints,

1052
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:29,840
but they were of poor quality
and couldn't be identified.

1053
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:31,270
Now keep in mind,

1054
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:34,560
the gun had lain for three
days in a damp environment,

1055
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:37,220
and this is not good for fingerprints,

1056
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:40,640
and I believe this explains
why the police were unable

1057
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,113
to find usable prints on that weapon.

1058
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:46,500
Finally, the differences
in the handwriting

1059
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,310
on the suicide note are notable.

1060
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:51,600
But I think you can look at this,

1061
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:54,230
and see that in the
latter part of the note,

1062
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:57,690
Kurt wrote this while under
the influence of drugs,

1063
00:50:57,690 --> 00:51:00,680
and a police expert looked at this,

1064
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,210
and confirmed that this indeed

1065
00:51:02,210 --> 00:51:04,453
was the handwriting of Kurt Cobain.

1066
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:07,270
For these reasons,

1067
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:11,820
I believe that Kurt Cobain
did indeed kill himself,

1068
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:14,313
and I think I've
discovered the reason why.

(fast-paced electronic music)

1138
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:05,890
- [Narrator] Kurt Cobain died from

1139
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:08,160
a single shotgun wound to the head,

1140
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,243
in what police said was a suicide.

1141
00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:14,660
Many people have disputed this conclusion,

1142
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:17,800
using the level of morphine
found in Kurt's body,

1143
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:20,130
to argue it would have
been impossible for him

1144
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:23,591
to have time to load a
gun and shoot himself.

1145
00:54:23,591 --> 00:54:24,510
(shotgun fires)

1146
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:26,350
- I have shown how the length of time

1147
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:28,820
that Kurt Cobain went undiscovered,

1148
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:31,220
and the location where the
blood sample was taken,

1149
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:34,480
could have had an effect
on the toxicology analysis.

1150
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,960
So I am ruling out foul play as being

1151
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:40,033
involved in some way with his death.

1152
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:44,730
I believe that Kurt Cobain
did indeed kill himself,

1153
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:48,957
and the evidence for this
rests in his family history.

1154
00:54:48,957 --> 00:54:51,330
(young Kurt drumming)
(ambient Music)

1155
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:55,760
We know that Kurt was diagnosed
at age nine with ADHD,

1156
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:59,240
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

1157
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,980
What wasn't known is that he was also

1158
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:05,280
likely suffering from bipolar disorder,

1159
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,673
and that used to be known
as manic depression.

1160
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:13,310
- Kurt's mother told me he
suffered from bipolar disorder,

1161
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:16,410
and it made sense when you saw how

1162
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:19,760
he was doing kind of wild, crazy things,

1163
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,417
because that typifies bipolar disorder.

1164
00:55:23,417 --> 00:55:25,350
(light percussive music)

1165
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:27,970
- It's a mood disorder
that's punctuated by

1166
00:55:27,970 --> 00:55:30,380
this very polarized way of behaving.

1167
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:33,080
This kind of addicted
workaholic that you know,

1168
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,760
wouldn't stop wanting to
get things to perfection,

1169
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,430
that you know, wanted to
find the best drummers,

1170
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:38,660
wanted to find the best riffs,

1171
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:40,560
wanted to make the most amazing music.

1172
00:55:42,490 --> 00:55:45,330
And then this other side,
which was a depressive,

1173
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:48,384
that just felt never quite good enough.

1174
00:55:48,384 --> 00:55:51,330
(moody music)

1175
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:53,420
It's a very difficult
condition to live with,

1176
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:55,770
and one that needs both proper medication,

1177
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:57,420
and proper psychological support.

1178
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:01,483
- I've not been able to find any evidence

1179
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:05,900
that Kurt Cobain was ever
treated for bipolar disorder,

1180
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:09,950
but I have discovered that
depression and suicide

1181
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:12,226
ran in the Cobain family.

1182
00:56:12,226 --> 00:56:13,370
(brooding electronic music)

1183
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:16,563
- I have lost two uncles and then Kurt.

1184
00:56:17,530 --> 00:56:20,400
They were the same age when
they killed themselves,

1185
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,597
because I remember Uncle Leland saying,

1186
00:56:23,597 --> 00:56:26,500
"Oh my gosh, you know in a
few years I'll be that age."

1187
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:29,143
And he was worried that he
would kill himself then.

1188
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,600
- I've also discovered that
the chronic stomach pain

1189
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,950
that Kurt thought he had been cured of,

1190
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:39,327
had returned in the
weeks prior to his death.

1191
00:56:39,327 --> 00:56:41,930
(light symphonic music)

1192
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:44,400
- I think the reason
that Kurt killed himself

1193
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,503
can be summed up in one word, pain.

1194
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:53,350
He was in such pain, both emotional,

1195
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:55,930
psychological and physical,

1196
00:56:55,930 --> 00:56:58,393
that he just could not stand it anymore.

1197
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:01,703
He'd rather be dead than alive.

1198
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:06,330
- It's one of those terrible
ironies of his life,

1199
00:57:06,330 --> 00:57:09,710
that he worked so hard
to become something,

1200
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:13,053
and then once he did, he
didn't like it very much.

1201
00:57:14,850 --> 00:57:19,850
- I sincerely believe that
Kurt committed suicide,

1202
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:23,230
he clearly was not happy, running away,

1203
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:27,663
hiding, upping his usage,
not trusting anyone.

1204
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:32,163
- Kurt did appear happy in
the months before he died.

1205
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,381
- [Kurt's Voice] Ever
since I've been married

1206
00:57:34,381 --> 00:57:37,453
and I've had a child, I've
never been more optimistic.

1207
00:57:39,050 --> 00:57:41,373
- [Dr. Hunter] But I
think this was a facade.

1208
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:47,180
- When you see that kind
of happiness in somebody

1209
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:50,603
that you know has been
suicidal, watch out,

1210
00:57:51,730 --> 00:57:53,930
because that usually means that they have

1211
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:56,620
made the decision to kill themselves,

1212
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:58,663
and now they're feeling relief.

1213
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:03,660
- Having considered all
of the medical evidence,

1214
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:06,690
I believe suicide is the best explanation

1215
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:08,890
for Kurt Cobain's death,

1216
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:11,724
and this I think is how it happened.

1217
00:58:11,724 --> 00:58:14,000
(skies thundering)
(slow piano music)

1218
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,470
- [Narrator] April 5th, 1994, 6:00am,

1219
00:58:17,470 --> 00:58:19,263
the day of Kurt Cobain's death.

1220
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:24,060
Kurt removes the 20-gauge shotgun

1221
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:26,630
from its hiding place in his closet,

1222
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:29,093
and heads to the room above his garage.

1223
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:38,960
Once there, he finishes his suicide note,

1224
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:41,720
which he leaves in a planting tray,

1225
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:45,483
and spears with the red
ballpoint pen it's written in.

1226
00:58:46,438 --> 00:58:48,863
He unzips the bag holding his shotgun,

1227
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:54,163
he takes three cartridges out
of a box, and loads the gun.

1228
00:58:56,990 --> 00:59:00,120
He smokes five cigarettes
as he sits on the floor,

1229
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,643
before preparing his final hit of heroin.

1230
00:59:04,890 --> 00:59:08,820
It contains so much of the
drug that once injected,

1231
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:10,593
it would kill him within a minute.

1232
00:59:11,869 --> 00:59:14,940
(fast-paced nervy music)

1233
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:16,780
After injecting the heroin,

1234
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:19,610
Kurt places the gun barrel in his mouth,

1235
00:59:19,610 --> 00:59:22,060
and pulls the trigger.
(shotgun fires)

1236
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:23,263
He dies instantly.

1237
00:59:28,210 --> 00:59:31,010
- I believe that Kurt
Cobain killed himself,

1238
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:33,290
whilst suffering from
the untreated effects

1239
00:59:33,290 --> 00:59:36,820
of his mental illness, bipolar disorder.

1240
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:39,630
His depressed mental state
was further exacerbated

1241
00:59:39,630 --> 00:59:42,490
by the physical pain of
his stomach condition,

1242
00:59:42,490 --> 00:59:45,860
and the decline in his
mental and physical state,

1243
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:47,743
from his excessive use of heroin.

1244
00:59:48,627 --> 00:59:52,810
(stirring symphonic music)

1245
00:59:52,810 --> 00:59:55,610
- [Narrator] Kurt's death
left a generation in mourning,

1246
00:59:56,950 --> 01:00:01,053
but his image untarnished by age and time.

1247
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:04,090
- He'd be turning 50,

1248
01:00:04,090 --> 01:00:07,360
and you can speculate on
what it was he'd be doing,

1249
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:12,360
had he lived, but doing the
nostalgia tour with Nirvana,

1250
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,450
slightly fatter and balder
playing all their old hits,

1251
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:19,550
I don't think he would have gone for that.
