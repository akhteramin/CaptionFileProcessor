MANEUVER INTO SOME SORT OF TALKS THAT WOULD BE THE BEST POSITION FOR THEM. OKAY.
 KIM BER LE THANK YOU FOR THE EXPERTISE.
 APPRECIATE IT.
 ALL RIGHT. IT IS THE TOP OF THE HOUR.
 GOOD MONDAY MORNING.
 IM IN NEW YORK. HES ACCUSED OF SEEKING OUT MINERS AND PAYING CASH TO GIRLS AS YOUNG AS 14 YEARS OLD AND THEN PAYING THEM TO RECRUIT OTHER GIRLS FOR HIM TO ABU ANUND IN PUBLIC.CHARGES WILL BE A PRESS CONFERENCE WILL BE HELD WITH PROSECUTORS AND THE FBI AND LATER THIS MORNING EPSTEIN WILL APPEAR IN COURT. OUR ANCHOR AND NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT ERICA HILL IS ME COURTHOUSE.
 WE BEGIN WITH THIS HOUR FEDERAL PROSECUTORS HAVE JUST UNSEALED AN INDICTMENT AGAINST JEFFREY EP TEEN. STILL UNKNOWN WHAT THIS CASE COULD REVEAL ABOUT HIS POLITICAL CONNTIS AND THEY INCLUDE A BRITISH ROYAL A PRESIDENT AND THE CURRENT ONE EPSTEIN QUOTE A TERRIFIC GUY. WE HAVE TEAM COVERAGE THIS MORNING.
 INSIDE IT THE ALARMING DETAILS OF HOW THE POLITICALLY CONNECTED BILLIONAIRE ALLEGEDLY RAN A SEX TRAFFICKING RING. SHIMON Y HELDRE ND ADEY ENCOUNT ESCALATED.
 AND SOME OF THE GIRLS SAYING  IN SOME OF JULIE BROWNS REPORTING WE SHOULD POINT OUT. THE ALLEGED VICTIMS TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY DIDNT KNOW IT WAS GOING TO MAYBE GO THAT WAY.
 OR THEY KNEW IT WASNT RIGHT BUT AGAIN THEY WERE YOUNG AND DIDNT GET IT.
 AND IT ALSO POINTS OUT IN THE INDICTMENT THAT THEY BELIEVE PROSECUTORS BELIEVE HE DID KNOW THEIR AGES AND WHAT WAS GOING ON BECAUSE SOME OF THESE VICTIMS WHO WERE IN HERE WERE ASKED SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THEIR AGE AND THEY SAID THEY DIDNT LIE.
 LETS TALK ABOUT THE POWERFUL PEOPLE IN POLITICS THAT WERE FRIENDS INCLUDING PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON WHICH I THINK RECORDS SHOW FLEW ON HIS JET SEVERAL TIMES.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP IS QUOTED WITH GLOWING WORDS ABOUT HIM BACK IN NAIN FACT.
 IN 2002 HE TALKED ABOUT HIM TO NEW YORK MAGAZINE HE SAID HES A TERRIFIC GUY HES A LOT OF FUN TO BE WITH.
 ITS EVEN SAID THAT HE LIKES BEAUTIFUL WOMEN AS MUCH AS I DO AND MANY OF THEM ARE ON THE YOUNGER SIDE.
 NO DOUBT ABOUT IT JEFFREY ENJOYS HIS SOCIAL LIGHT.
 OBVIOUSLY THATS SEEN IN A FAR DIFFERENT LIGHT TODAY.
 BUT THERE IS A CONNECTION HERE.
 YOU MENTIONED FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON FLYING ON HIS PLANE BEING ON HIS PRIVATE ISLAND.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP REPORTEDLY ON HIS PLANE.
 AND AT ONE POINT EP TEEN WAS A MEMBER OF MARALAGO AND HAD BEEN THERE BUT WAS BARRED AT ONE POINT.
 HE WAS ACCUSED OF SEXUALLY ASSAULTING AN UNDERAGE GIRL THERE.
 I WOULD BE REMISS NOT TO BRING UP WITH YOU THE CURRENT LABOR SECRETARY ALEXANDER ACOSTA WHO IS VERY TIED TO THIS BECAUSE HE WAS A PART OF SECURING THE SWEET PLEA DEAL FOR EPSTEIN BACK IN 2008 THAT GOT HIM VERY LITTLE JAIL TIME CHARGED WITH PROSTITUTION NOT SEX TRAFFICKING AND BY THE WAY THAT NONE OF THE VICTIMS KNEW ABOUT. NO.
 THEY DIDNT. SO A COUPLE OF POINTS THERE.
 NUMBER ONE YOURE RIGHT.
 ALEXANDER ACOSTA AT THE TIME WAS THE U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT SO HE HAD TO OVERSEE THIS DEAL.
 HE TO SAY OKAY WITH TEAM OF ATTORNEYS.
 AT THE TIME HE SAID THEY LACKED THE EVIDENCE TO PROVE THAT HE HAD VIOLATED FEDERAL LIEU.
 THERES BEEN A LOT OF PUSHBACK ON THAT SINCE.
 WELL THE DOJ IS INVESTIGATING HOW THE CASE WAS HANDLE.
 WE SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT IN FEBRUARY A FEDERAL JUDGE SAID THIS DEAL BROKE THE LAW BECAUSE THE VICTIMS DIDNT KNOW ABOUT IT.
 THE TERMS OF THIS DEAL WHICH ITS BEEN SAID MULTIPLE TIMES WERE BASICALLY DICTATED BY EPSTEINS ATTORNEYS POWERFUL ATTORNEYS THEY DIDNT KNOW ABOUT IT.
 THE DEAL WAS KEPT QUIET AND KEPT APART FROM THE VICTIMS UNTIL A JUDGE SIGNED OFF ON IT.
 YOU CANT DO THAT. THAT BROKE THE LAW.
 GREAT REPORTING.
 OBVIOUSLY WELL BE ON THIS ALL DAY BECAUSE HES GOING TO BE IN COURTHIS MORNING.
 LETS TALK ABOUT WHERE THIS GORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR IS HERE.ARE A G VOICE THIS BECAUSE YOUE ACTUALLY PROSECUTED SEX TRAFFICKING CASES BEFORE.
 ONE THING THAT SHIMON SAID OUTSIDHEOURTENTS AGO THAT STRUCK ME IS THAT WHAT MAY BE DIFFERENT THIS TIME THAN THE PLEA DEAL IN 2008 IF THIS GOES TO TRIAL IS THAT THEY HAE THREE COOPERATORS AND THOSEORE APPARENTLY SOME OF THE EMPLOYEES THAT ARRANGED THE TRAVEL OF THE UNDERAGE GIRLS TO BE WITH EPSTEIN.
