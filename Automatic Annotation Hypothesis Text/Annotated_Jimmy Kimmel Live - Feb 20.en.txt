 AND NOW IN ALL SINCERITY JIMMY KIMMEL!
 VERY NICE. IM JIMMY. IM THE HOST OF THE SHOW. THANK YOU FOR COMING. WELCOME.
 HI EVERYBODY HOW YOU DOING?
 WELCOME TO HOLLYWOOD.
 APPRECIATE THAT.
 HEY I HAVE A STORY. SO LAST NIGHT LAST NIGHT AFTER THE SHOW I HOSTED A CONCERT. IT WAS A BIG CONCERT AT THE FORUM.
 IT WAS A TRIBUTE TO THE LATE GREAT CHRIS CORNELL. WERE YOU THERE?
 IS THAT WHY YOURE YELLING? THE LINEUP WAS INCREDIBLE.
 IT WAS CHRIS STAPLETON.
 ADAM LEVINE METALLICA FOO FIGHTERS. AMAZING.
 YOU HAD FUN GUILLERMO? A LOT OF FUN.
 Jimmy GUILLERMOS LIKE HEY ARE YOU GOING LIKE COME WITH  AT ONE POINT IN THE NIGHT IT WAS TWOTHIRDS THROUGH THE SHOW AT ONE POINT IN THE NIGHT IT WAS TWOTHIRDS THROUGH THE SHOW AND SOMEBODY YELLED WHERES GUILLERMO. SO I GAVE GUILLERMO A SHOUT OUT I SAID GUILLERMOS HERE. IN ALL FAIRNESS HE HAS TO GO TO BED EARLY BECAUSE HES GOT TO BE AT WORK AT 200 P.M. TODAY IS DAY 27 OF THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN.
 AND THE WHOLE FORUM ERUPTED IN CHEERS. ITS LIKE THE SAME REACTION THEY GAVE BRAD PITT. SO I GO BACK STAGE AND TEXT GUILLERMO. I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT HE THOUGHT. AND WHERE WERE YOU WHEN YOU GOT THE TEXT I SENT YOU? I WAS AT HOME. REMEMBER WHEN TRUMP SAID HED RUN THE COUNTRY LIKE A BUSINESS? TURNS OUT THE BUSINESS IS RADIO SHACK.
 Jimmy HE WAS AT HOME. AFTER METALLICA HE DITCHED US GOT IN A UBER AND WENT HOME.
  APPLAUSE  HE IS DESPERATELY TRYING TO PIN BLAME ON THE SHUTDOWN ON THE DEMOCRATS. HE WROTE TOTALLY UNHINGED. MOST OF HIS IRE IS DIRECTED AT NANCY PELOSI THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE. SHE WAS GOING ON MILITARY AIRCRAFT.
 THEY NO LONGER CARE FOR MA IS RIGHT FOR THE COUNTRY. YESTERDAY SHE SENT HIM A LETTER SUGGESTING HE POSTPONE THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS UNTIL THE SHUTDOWN IS OVER. SHE WILL NOT PERMIT HIM TO GIVE IT FROM THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. SO TODAY TRUMP RETALIATED IN A LETTER OF HIS OWN TELLING HER THAT HE WAS CANCELING HER FLIGHT TO AFGHANISTAN.
 HES JUST AS GOOD AT SPELLING COUNTRY AS HE IS RUNNING IN IT.
 AND HE SAID IF SHE WANTED TO GO SHE COULD FLY COMMERCIAL TO A WAR ZONE. AND HE SENT THE LETTER LESS THAN AN HOUR BEFORE SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO LEAVE. HE MAY BE THE ONLY ONE PLEASED BECAUSE EVEN SOME OF HIS FELLOW REPUBLICANS SAID THIS WAS A PETTY THING TO DO.
 IT WAS THE EQUIVALENT OF YOU BREAK UP WITH ME? I BREAK UP WITH YOU. I BET HE WAS SO DELIGHTED WITH HIMSELF WHEN HE CAME UP WITH THE IDEA. AN OFFICIAL FROM THE WHITE HOUSE SAID HE SPENT THE DAY WATCHING COVERAGE OF IT AND WAS VERY PLEASED THIS AFTERNOON. AND ALL THE DEMOCRATS ARE MAD.
 THIS IS FROM CNN TODAY. PHIL MATTINGLY STOPPED STENY HOYER LIKE THIS.
 HOLD ON ONE SECOND. HERES HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER STENY HOYER TALKING ABOUT WHATS GOING ON. THAT IS THE MOST THREATENING MICROPHONE IVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE.  APPLAUSE  GIVE ME YOUR MONEY OLD MAN!
 Jimmy HOLD ON A SECOND.
 DESPERATE TIMES I GUESS. YOU KNOW IF THE DEMOCRATS CANT CONVINCE TRUMP TO END THIS SILLY SHUTDOWN I THINK I KNOW SOMEBODY WHO CAN.
 A LOT OF PEOPLE TRY TO MAKE SENSE OUT OF THIS.
 THE CLEAREST VOICE IVE HEARD ON THE SUBJECT SO FAR BELIEVE IT OR NOT CAME FROM CARDI B. HEY YALL I JUST WANT TO REMIND YALL. TRUMP IS NOW ORDERING FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WORKERS TO GO BACK TO WORK WITHOUT GETTING PAID. NOW I DONT WANT TO HERE YOUR BLEEP TALKING ABOUT OH BUT OBAMA SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT FOR 17 DAYS YEAH BITCH BUT HEALTH CARE SO YOUR GRANDMA CAN CHECK HER BLOOD PRESSURE AND YOU WHAT TO  BLEEP   BLEEP .  APPLAUSE  Jimmy CARDI B IS RIGHT.
 ITS BEEN A LITTLE OVER THREE WEEKS.
 ITS BEEN A LITTLE BIT OVER THREE WEEKS.
 ALMOST 800000 FEDERAL EMPLOYEES ARE NOT GETTING PAID.
 AND EVERY NIGHT UNTIL THIS IS OVER WERE HIRING A FURLOUGHED WORKER PER NIGHT.
 LAST NIGHT WE BROUGHT IN A NASA ENGINEER WHOS OUT OF WORK. LETS SAY HELLO TO OUR NEW EMPLOYEE TONIGHT.
