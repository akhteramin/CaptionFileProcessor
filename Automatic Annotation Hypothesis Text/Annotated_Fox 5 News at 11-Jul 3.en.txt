 FOX5 JOSH ROSENTHAL IS LIVE NEAR LINCOLN MEMORIAL WITH THE LATEST HEY JOSH.
 HEY SHAWRNGS YOU KNOW WERE LESS THAN 24 HOURS AWAY. AS YOU CAN SEE THIS YEARS FOUVRJ JULY WILL BE DIFFERENT THAN YEARS PAST.
 IN MY MIND THIS IT GREAT.
 CONGRESS DONT GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER AND WANT TO WASTE ON THEIR PET PROJECTS WHY NOT HAVE SOMETHING TO CELEBRATE US.
 EVERYONE IS NOT QUITE SO PLEASED.
 HERES THE DEAL WASHINGTON POSTS REPORTED NATIONAL PARK SERVICES DIVERTING 2.59 MILLION TO DIVERT COSTS. THERES A 1 IS 2 BILLION BACKLOG.
 IT COULD HAVE BEEN SPENT ON PARKS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND POTHOLES ON CERTAIN ROAD RICK GW PARKWAY.
 MAINTENANCE NEEDS THE PARK SERVICE IS ALREADY STRUGGLING TO PATLE.
 THEY WANT TO PROTECT NATIONAL PARKS AND PROVIDE MONEY NECESSARY TO ADDRESS BACKLOG OF PARK SERVICE AND THEN THEY USE VALUABLE DOLLARS FROM PARK VISITORS TO PAY FOR THIS SPECTACLE.
 AND I REACHED OUT TO THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE WITH A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND THEY DEPOSIT ANSWER ANY.
 THEY SENT A STATEMENT DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR IS COMMITTED TO PROVIDING AMERICAN PEOPLE FANTASTIC CELEBRATION OF NATIONS BIRTHDAY AND DOING SO CONSISTENT WITH THE DEPARTMENTS MISSION AND HISTORICAL PRACTICES.
 I WANT TO MENTION WE DONT HAVE A FINAL TOTAL PRICE FAING TAG FOR THE EVENT. HOWEVER SOME OF THE STUFF YOU SEE FOR INSTANCE EXTRA FOYER WORKS HAVE BEEN DONATESED BACK TO YOU.
 AND PRESIDENT SALUTE TO AMERICA TOMORROW IS EXPECTED TO ATTRACT PROTESTERS.
 MEMBERS OF CODE PINK PLAN TO DEM SCAIT.
