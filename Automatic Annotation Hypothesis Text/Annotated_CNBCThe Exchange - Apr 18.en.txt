 BOB PA SANI THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW TO WASHINGTON BECAUSE THE OTHER BIG THING TO HIT THE TAPE TODAY WAS THE MUELLER REPORT ITS PERHAPS MORE HEAVILY REDACTED THAN MANY HAD THOUGHT OR HOPED BUT AT 400 OR SO PAGES LONG OUR TEAM IS STILL POURING THROUGH IT MANY EAMON JAVERS STILL TRYING TO DIGEST THAT THE HEADLINE IS OUT THERE THE PRESIDENTS BEEN SAYING THAT THROUGHOUT THE DAY NO COLLUSION NO OBSTRUCTION THATS GOOD NEWS FOR THIS WHITE HOUSE.
 INSIDE THE DOCUMENT WERE FINDING SOME OF THE AREAS OF CONCERN FOR ROBERT MUELLER PARTICULARLY AROUND THE AREA OF POTENTIAL OBSTRUCTION OF THE JUSTICE AND THE PRESIDENTS PUBLIC STATEMENTS HIS TWEETS EVEN ABOUT SOME OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THIS WHOLE SITUATION THOSE WERE RED FLAGS FOR ROBERT MUELLER IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.
 PARTICULARLY ON THIS IDEA OF  ALL RIGHT SO WHEN WE GET EAMON BACK UP SOMEONE PULLED THE PLUG LITERALLY ON EAMON.
 LETS TALK ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE MARKETS AND POLICY GOINGFORWARD.
 LETS BRING IN LIBBY CANTRELL HEAD OF PIMCO.
 THE DEMOCRATS ARE GOING DO COMPLAIN ITS TOO HEAVILY REDACTED WE NEED TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER.
 WHAT DO YOU SEE GOINGFORWARD?
 THIS IS HITTING THROUGH A PARTISAN LENS.
 THE REPUBLICANS ARE SORT 6 CLAIMING VINDICATION HERE THAT THERES NO COLLUSION DEMOCRATS MAY WALKTHROUGH THE DOOR THAT THE MUELLER REPORT OPENED IN TERMS OF INVESTIGATING FURTHER WHETHER THERE IS OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.
 I THINK YOULL HEAR LOUDER CALLS FOR IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS FROM THE LEFT SPEAKER PELOSI WILL DO EVERYTHING SHE CAN TO NOT HEED THOSE CALLS.
 WASHINGTON IS WEATHER POLARIZED ALREADY PARTISAN THERE WAS NOT LEEWAY ANYWAY.
 THE BIG THINGS THAT PRESIDENT INTERRUPT WANTS TO MOVE LEGISLATIVELY IS NAFTA 2.0 THAT MIGHT BE HARDER TO MOVE NOW WITH A MORE FRACTURED RELATIONSHIP DO YOU BELIEVE THAT RON TO LIBBYS POINT THAT IN SOME WAYS WILL AFFECT WHAT SHOULD BE BIPARTISAN OR NONPARTISAN.
 PURELY ECONOMIC NEGOTIATIONS YEAH I DONT THINK THERES ANY ESCAPING MAYBE THE OVERHANG THAT LIBBY ALLUDED TO. WITHIN THE OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE COMPONENT OF THIS REPORT BOB MUELLER EFFECTIVELY PUNTED TO CON AND SUGGESTED IN THE ABSENCE OF HIS BEING ABLE TO DO ANYTHING WHICH SAYS YOU CANNOT INDICT A SITTING PRESIDENT HE REALLY SUGGESTED THAT CONGRESS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT TAKE THIS UP TO THE EXTENT THEYRE DISTRACTED OR OBSESSED BY THIS IT WILL SLOW DOWN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND CREATE EVEN MORE FRACTURES BETWEEN THE DEMOCRATS AND THE HOUSE AND THE WHITE HOUSE ITSELF YOU KNOW JOHN WHEN BARRS LETTER CAME OUT PEOPLE SAID OKAY THIS IS OVER IT APPEARS THAT RON IS SUGGESTING MAYBE WE ARE JUST GETTING STARTED ON A SECOND PHASE OF THIS.
 WELL I THINK THATS BECAUSE BARRS LETTER WAS SUCH A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THIS AND THE REPORT TODAY GIVES US A LOT MORE DETAIL AS EAMON WAS SAYING BEFORE SOMEBODY PULLED THE PLUG THAT A LOT OF DETAIL ABOUT THE POTENTIAL OBSTRUCTION THAT THE PRESIDENT HAD ENGAGED IN ORDERS TO DON McGANN THEN THE WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL TO DIRECT ROD ROSENSTEIN TO FIRE ROBERT MUELLER THE SPECIAL COUNSEL McGANN REFUSING OFFERING HIS RESIGNATION AND ULTIMATELY STAYING ON A WHILE LONGER AND TELLING AIDS THAT TRUMP HAD ASKED HIM TO DO CRAZY STUFF.
 I THINK ALL OF THAT AND TO LIBBYS POINT EARLIER I THINK IT WAS THE RIGHT ONE I BELIEVE THAT THE WAY THE ADMINISTRATION THROUGH BILL BARR IN THE LETTER AND TODAYS PRESS CONFERENCE IN WHICH HE SEEMED TO BE SPINNING FOR THE PRESIDENT TO BLUNT THE IMPACT OF THE REPORT I THINK THATS GOING TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR SPEAKER PELOSI TO RESIST THOSE IN HER CAUCUS WHO INSIST ON AN IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDING TO WEIGH THIS IN A WAY THAT THEY THINK IS SEARCHING AND FAIR.
 YEAH AND EAMON JAVERS IS ALIVE AND WELL HE IS BACK WITH US SOMEONE PULLED THE PLUG BUT NOT ON HIM LITERALLY.
 NO CENSORSHIP HERE.
 HES NOT REDACTED YOUVE BEEN THERE DAY IN AND DAY OUT FOR US YOUVE SEEN THE BACK AND FORTH INSIDE THE SPEAKERS CHAMBER AND TALKING ABOUT THIS WITH SARAH SANDERS ONE WONDERS HOW MUCH MORE OF ANY DIALOGUE THAT WE HAVE IS SIMPLY GOING TO BE ABOUT THE REPORT FROM NOW ON THE ADMINISTRATION CAN TALK ABOUT DEFENSE SPENDING OR INFRASTRUCTURE OR IMMIGRATION WHATEVER IT IS AND EVERY QUESTION IS GOING TO GO BACK TO THIS REPORT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MAYBE YOURS WELL YOU KNOW THATS RIGHT I MEAN FIRST OF ALL THIS IS A WHITE HOUSE THAT DOESNT BRIEF THE PRESS ANY MORE THEYRE NOT GOING TO FACE THIS TELEADVISED SPECTACLE OF THE WHITE HOUSE TRYING TO GET OUT THE LINE OF THE DAY.
 YOURE GOING TO SEE THE PRESIDENT LEAVING HERE SHORTLY THIS AFTERNOON IN A COUPLE HOURS AND REPORTERS WILL ASK HIM QUESTIONS.
 I EXPECT HE WILL TALK HES BEEN TWEETING VIGOROUSLY TODAY HE HAS A LOT TO SAY ABOUT THIS.
 I EXPECT WERE GOING TO GET LENGTHY COMMENTS FROM THE PRESIDENT HERE I DONT GET THE SENSE THEYRE GOING TO REBUT MUCH OF THIS AT ALL.
 THEYRE GOING TO LET THIS SIT AND RETREAT TO THE HEADLINE OF NO OBSTRUCTION NO COLLUSION AND ON THE SMALLER THINGS LET ALL THAT GO.
 THERES SOME STUFF IN HERE ABOUT SARAH SANDERS AND HOW SHE RESPONDED TO THE COMEY FIRING BY SUGGESTING FBI AGENTS INSIDE THE BUREAU HAD LOST CONFIDENCE IN COMEY AND THEY HAD HEARD FROM COUNTLESS MEMBERS OF THE FBI WHO SAID THEY DIDNT LIKE COMEY IN HER INTERVIEW WITH THE SPECIAL COUNSELS TEAM SHE ADMITTED THAT DIDNT HAVE ANY BASIS IN FACT AND IT WAS A SLIP OF THE TONGUE OR SHE JUST KIND OF SAID IT AT THE TIME AND DIDNT REALLY BASE IT ON ANY FACTUAL BASIS.
 YOU KNOW THOSE SMALLER THINGS DOESNT SEEM LIKE THE WHITE HOUSE IS GOING TO ADDRESS AT ALL THEY MAY JUST LET THEM ALL GO THEYRE CONTENT WITH THE WIN HERE AND THEY FEEL LIKE THEYVE HAD A BIG POSITIVE POLITICAL DAY.
 IM NOT SURE HOW MUCH OF A WIN THERE IS I GOT THROUGH THE FIRST 50 PAGES OF THE REPORT THERES SOME MATERIALALITY WHEN IT COMES TO WHETHER OR NOT THE CAMPAIGN EXPECTED TO BENEFIT FROM RUSSIAS ACTIONS AND INTERFERING.
 NOT RISING TO THE LEVEL OF CRIMINALITY.
 BUT FROM A MARKET PERSPECTIVE THIS MAY IN MANY WAYS TURN NEUTRAL IN SO FAR AS WERE SEEING A RESYNCHRONIZATION OF CHINESE AND AMERICAN ECONOMIC GROWTH EUROPES THE OUTLIER AT THE MOMENT WERE SEEING THE FED BACK OFF AND CENTRAL BANKS START TO STIMULATE IF TODAYS RETAIL SALES NUMBER WERE ANY INDICATION OF WHERE WERE GOING FROM HERE THE MARKET MAY RETURN THE ATTENTION TO FUNDAMENTALS AND MAYBE IGNORE DAMAGE YOU FOR BRING IF RIGHT BACK DOWN THE CNBC LANE.
 ITS AMAZING THE RETAIL SALES NUMBER BETTER THAN EXPECTED.
 JOBLESS CLAIMS UNDER 200000 GDP REVISIONS ARE GOING UP AT GOLDMAN SACHS AND OTHERS ITS AMAZING THAT THIS IS GETTING ALL THE HEADLINES AND IF YOU JUST FOCUSED ON THIS YOU WOULD THINK THIS IS THE ONLY THING HAPPENING OUTSIDE OF THIS AMERICA ROLLS ON AND THE ECONOMY ROLLS ON AND THE PRESIDENT WILL HAVE A STRONG ECONOMY MOST LIKELY BEHIND HIM IN THAT REELECTION BID.
 MOST LIKELY AND OUR VIEW OF PIMCO IS THAT WELL SEE 2 2 12 GROWTH HERE IN THE UNITED STATES YOU HAVE THE EFFECT OF FADING FISCAL STIMULUS AND YOU HAVE A BIG IMPULSE FROM THE TAX BILL THAT WAS PASSED IN LATE 2017 AND A BIG SPENDING BILL THAT WAS PASSED IN 2018 ANOTHER AREA OF THIS MUELLER REPORT THAT COULD INFORM RELATIONS WITH CORNING THAT COULD BE RELEVANT IS THIS IDEA OF THE FISCAL CLIFF OF THE MARKETS ARE NOT FOCUSED ON THIS RIGHT NOW THATS BECAUSE IF COULDNT DOESNT STEP IN AND KEEP SPENDING LEVELS AT THE RATE THEY ARE NOW COME JANUARY 1st OF 2020 WE COULD SEE A HALF A PERCENT HEAD WIND OF ECONOMIC GROWTH BECAUSE OF THIS BIG DRIVEDOWN IN SPENDING.
 I THINK WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT CONGRESS IS EXPEDIENT.
