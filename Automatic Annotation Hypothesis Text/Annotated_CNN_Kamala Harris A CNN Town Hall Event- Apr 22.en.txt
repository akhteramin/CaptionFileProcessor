 FOR HOSTING THIS EVENT.
 ITS BEEN AN AMAZING NIGHT. RIGHT NOW ITS TIME TO WELCOME TO THIS STAGE SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS OF CALIFORNIA.
 FIVE OF THE TOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES HAVE SHARING THE SAME STAGE TONIGHT WITH YOUNG ADULTS FOR STUDENTS WHO PLAN TO VOTE IN THEIR STATE AND PRIMARY CAUCUSES.
 WEVE ALREADY HEARD FROM SENATORS AMY KLOBUCHAR ELIZABETH WARREN AND BERNIE SANDERS.
 HI HI.
 GOOD TO SEE YOU.
 HAVE A SEAT.
 THANK YOU.
 WOW THEYRE HAPPY TO SEE YOU.
 GOOD TO SEE YOU GUYS.
 LETS GET TO IT. WE WANT YOU TO GET AS MUCH OUT OF THE NEXT HOUR AS POSSIBLE.
 LETS START WITH WHATS DOMINATING THE NEWS THE FALLOUT FROM THE MUELLER REPORT.
 YES.
 WE HAVE A QUESTION FROM C CARCARLA ALVARADO A SENIOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS.
 GOOD EVENING SENATOR HARRIS IN LIGHT OF MUELLERS REPORT DO YOU BELIEVE THE DEMOCRATS A CONGRESS SHOULD RECONSIDER THEIR POSITION ON IMPEACHMENT?
 IT DEPENDS ON WHO YOURE TALKING TO ON WHAT THEIR POSITION IS HERES WHAT I FEEL ABOUT IT AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CARLA.
 LOOK FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THE INVESTIGATION AND HAVE SEEN ANY PART OF THAT REPORT IT IS VERY CLEAR THAT THERE IS A LOT OF GOOD EVIDENCE POINTING TO OBSTRUCTION AND OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.
 AND I BELIEVE VERY STRONGLY FIRST OF ALL LET ME JUST BE VERY CLEAR THE TABLE SET.
 I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO GET RID OF THIS PRESIDENT. THATS WHY IM RUNNING TO BECOME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
 THAT IS PART OF THE PREMISE OBVIOUSLY OF MY PLAN.
 BUT I THINK WE ARE VERY GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS AN INVESTIGATION THAT HAS BEEN CONDUCTED WHICH HAS PRODUCED EVIDENCE THAT TELLS US THAT THIS PRESIDENT AND HIS ADMINISTRATION ENGAGED IN OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.
 I BELIEVE CONGRESS SHOULD TAKE THE STEPS TOWARDS IMPEACHMENT.
 BUT I WANT TO SAY THIS BECAUSE IT DOESNT END THERE. I ALSO WANT TO SAY THIS.
 IM ALSO A REALIST.
 AND WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING OVER THE TWO YEARS AND SOME MONTHS IVE BEEN IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE I HAVE ALSO WITNESSED FOLKS IN THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS AND IN PARTICULAR IN THE GOP WHO HAVE BEEN PRESENTED WITH MANY REASONS TO PUSH BACK AGAINST THIS PRESIDENT AND THEY HAVE NOT.
 AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THE IMPEACHMENT PROCESS THERE WILL BE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE HOUSE AND AN INVESTIGATION THAT TAKES PLACE.
 I THINK WE CAN BE PRETTY SURE IT LOOKS LIKE THAT IS VERY LIKELY TO HAPPEN AND THEN ITS GOING TO GO OVER TO THE SENATE.
 AND THE HOUSE NEEDS TO BE A VOTE BY A MAJORITY A SIMPLE MAJORITY AND THEN ITS GOING TO COME OVER TO THE SENATE AND IVE NOT SEEN ANY EVIDENCE SINCE IVE BEEN IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE THAT SENATE AND THE REPUBLICANS HOLD THE MAJORITY IVE NOT SEEN ANY EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT THEY WILL WEIGH ON THE FACTS INSTEAD OF ON PARTISAN ADHERENCE TO BEING PROTECTIVE OF THIS PRESIDENT AND THATS WHAT CONCERNS ME AND WHAT WILL BE THE EVENTUAL OUTCOME.
 WE HAVE TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT THE END RESULT BUT THAT DOESNT MEAN THE PROCESS SHOULD NOT TAKE HOLD.
 THANK YOU SENATOR.
 A LOT OF STUDENTS HERE AT THE HARVARD INSTITUTE OF POLITICS THEYRE CONCERNED ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE AND HOW THAT AFFECTS THEM AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS.
 BEN.
 THANK YOU SENATOR AS A FUTURE EDUCATOR I AM REALLY BOTHERED THAT PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE BEING TARGETS FOR MASS SHOOTINGS.
 TWO DAYS AGO WAS THE 20th ANNIVERSARY OF THE COLUMBINE MASSACRE BUT TWO DECADES LATER NO MAJOR GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION HAS BEEN PASSED.
 AS PRESIDENT WHO WILL YOU GO ABOUT KEEPING OUR SCHOOLS SAFE AND KEEPING GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO SHOULD NOT HAVE THEM?
 IM SURE THERE ARE PLENTY OF STUDENTS HERE WHILE YOU WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL EVEN MIDDLE SCHOOL THAT YOU HAD TO PARTICIPATE IN A DRILL RIGHT WHERE YOU WERE CONVENED AND YOUR TEACHERS TAUGHT YOU ABOUT HOW YOU NEED TO GO AND RUN IN A CLOSET BECAUSE THERE MAY BE A MASS SHOOTER ROAMING THE HALLWAYS OF YOUR SCHOOL.
 AND IN OUR AMERICA THAT SHOULD NEVER HAVE TO HAPPEN.
 CONVERSATIONS TAKE PLACE EVERY NIGHT CONVERSATIONS TAKE PLACE EVERY NIGHT BETWEEN STATUTES AND THEIR PARENTS WHY DO THESE THINGS HAVE TO HAPPEN WHY DO WE HAVE A DRILL LIKE THAT AND THE RESPONSE IS THERE ARE PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON D.C. SUPPOSED LEADERS WHO HAVE FAILED TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO REJECT A FALSE CHOICE WHICH YOURE EITHER IN FAVOR OF SECOND AMENDMENT OR YOU WANT TO TAKE PEOPLES GUNS AWAY.
 SUPPOSED LEADERS IN WASHINGTON D.C. TO HAVE FAILED THE COURAGE TO RECOGNIZE YOU WANT TO GO HUNTING THATS FINE BUT WE NEED REASONABLE GUN SAFETY LAWS IN THIS COUNTRY STARTING WITH UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS AND A RENEWAL OF THE ASSAULT WEAPON BAN BUT THEY HAVE FAILED TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO ACT.
 BEN HERE IS MY RESPONSE TO YOU.
 UPON BEING ELECTED I WILL GIVE THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS 100 DAYS TO GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER AND HAVE THE COURAGE TO PASS REASONABLE GUN SAFETY LAWS.
 AND IF THEY FAIL TO DO IT THEN I WILL TAKE EXECUTIVE ACTION. AND SPECIFICALLY WHAT I WILL DO IS PUT IN PLACE A REQUIREMENT THAT FOR ANYONE WHO SELLS MORE THAN FIVE GUNS A YEAR THEY ARE REQUIRED TO DO BACKGROUND CHECKS WHEN THEY SELL THOSE GUNS.
 I WILL REQUIRE THAT FOR ANY GUN DEALER THAT BREAKS THE LAW THE ATF TAKE THEIR LICENSE.
 AND BY THE WAY ATF ALCOHOL TOBACCO AND FIREARMS THEYVE BEEN DOING A LOT OF A ANDTIF WE NEED TO FIX THAT.
