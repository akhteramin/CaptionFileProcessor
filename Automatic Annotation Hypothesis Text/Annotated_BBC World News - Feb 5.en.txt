 APPLAUSE AND NOW BBC WORLD NEWS.
 LS AMERICA.
 REPORTING FROM WASHINGTON I AM LAURA TREVELYAN.
 COUNTDOWN TO THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL CALL FOR UNITY IN FRONT OF A DEEPLY DIVIDED CONGRESS.
 MR. NEESON ARE YOU SORRY FOR WHAT YOU SAID?
 LAURA ACTOR LIAM NEESON SAYS HE IS NO RACIST AFTER HIS DESIRE FOR REVENGE CAUSES AN UPROAR.
 VERY FIRST PICTURE I TOOK.
 LAURA PLUS DON MCCULLINS CAMERA CAPTURED THE HUMAN COST OF BATTLE.
 WE HEAR HOW HE TURNED HIS LENS ON THE HOME FRONT TOO.
 LAURA WELCOME TO OUR VIEWERS ON PUBLIC TELEVISION IN THE U.S. AND AROUND THE GLOBE.
 WASHINGTON IS POISED FOR TONIGHTS STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS BY PRESIDENT TRUMP.
 AIDES SAY HE WILL CALL FOR BIPARTISAN COOPERATION AND UNITY.
 BUT MR. TRUMP WILL DELIVER HIS PRIMETIME ADDRESS TO A DIVIDED CONGRESS WHILE STILL SMARTING AFTER THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN OVER THE PRESIDENTS CALL FOR A BORDER WALL WITH MEXICO.
 KATTY KAY JOINED ME EARLIER.
 WHITE HOUSE AIDES HAVE SAID THIS IS GOING TO BE ABOUT COMITY BUT GIVEN HOW DIVIDED THE TWO SIDES ARE CAN ANYTHING BE ACHIEVED?
 KATTY LOOK I THINK WHAT THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO DO TONIGHT IS REACH OUT TO VOTERS IN THE MIDDLE WITH SOME SORT OF UNITY AND BIPARTISANSHIP.
 WE WILL HEAR THAT TOWNE  TONE.
 IT IS BEING WRITTEN INTO HIS SPEECH AT THE MOMENT. AND ALSO APPEAL TO HIS BASE WITH A TOUGHER LINE ON IMMIGRATION AND THE BORDER WALL.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP KNOWS HE WILL NOT GET A TELEVISION AUDIENCE THIS BIG AGAIN UNTIL THE 2020 REELECTION CAMPAIGN IS WELL UNDERWAY. AND SO HE HAS GOT THAT POLITICAL TIMETABLE IN MIND.
 JUGGLING THOSE TWO THINGS IS GOING TO BE TRICKY IN TERMS OF TONE AND WE KNOW WHAT IS SAID IN A SPEECH TONIGHT ON CAPITOL HILL COULD VERY QUICKLY BE OVERTURNED WITH ONE TWEET TOMORROW MORNING.
 LAURA IT CAN INDEED.
 IS THIS LAYING OUT THE BATTLE LINES FOR THE 2020 ELECTION?
 KATTY I THINK IT IS.
 THERE ARE AREAS WHERE THE PRESIDENT AND THE REPUBLICANS DEMOCRATS DO AGREE.
 THEY COULD DO A BIG DEAL ON INFRASTRUCTURE. I SUSPECT WE WILL HEAR THE PRESIDENT REACH OUT TO DEMOCRATS ON AN ISSUE LIKE THAT.
 THE TROUBLE IS THERE IS SO LITTLE TRUST ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE OF THIS PRESIDENT THAT ARE THEY WILLING TO GIVE HIM SOME KIND OF DEAL THAT HE CAN TAKE HOME AND SAY LOOK IVE MANAGED TO ACHIEVE SOMETHING?
 THE 2020 REELECTION CAMPAIGN IN A SENSE IS STARTING RIGHT NOW.
 WE HAVE ALREADY HAD THOSE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES WHO HAVE LAUNCHED THEIR BIDS.
 THEY WILL BE SITTING RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE PRESIDENT.
 TONIGHT IS HIS BIG AUDIENCE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HE HAS ACHIEVED AND WHAT HE CAN STILL ACHIEVE AND THE SPECTACLE OF THIS CROWD CROWNED BY NANCY PELOSI SITTING RIGHT BEHIND HIM THE DEMOCRAT WHO HAS JUST GIVEN HIM A TOUGH TIME TOUGH RUN FOR HIS MONEY OVER THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN.
 YOU ARE RIGHT THE 2020 REELECTION CAMPAIGN IS ALL OVER THIS STATE OF THE NOON ADDRESS.
 LAURA WHAT WILL YOU BE WATCHING FOR WHEN YOU SEE NANCY PELOSI THERE THE SYMBOL OF DIVIDED GOVERNMENT WATCHING OVER THE PRESIDENT?
 KATTY IT IS ALMOST A VISUAL REMINDER IN EVERY SHOT BECAUSE IN THESE STATES OF THE UNIONS YOU HAVE THE PRESIDENT AND THEN THE TWO PEOPLE MIKE PENCE AND NANCY PELOSI BEHIND HIM. THEY ARE IN ALMOST EVERY SHOT.
 IT IS ALMOST A VISUAL REMINDER OF THIS NEW TOUGHER POLITICAL LANDSCAPE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP FACES.
 I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF SHE GIVES HIM A MUCH MORE THAN A CURSORY ROUND OF APPLAUSE IN THE BEGINNING.
 THE REST OF THE TIME I EXPECT HER TO SIT STONEFACED WHILE VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE ITS THEIR CHEERING.
 THAT IS THE KIND OF PROSPECT THAT ALWAYS COMES UP IN STATES OF THE UNION.
 REMEMBER IT IS NOT JUST NANCY PELOSI SITTING BEHIND HIM.
 IT IS ALL THOSE NEWLY ELECTED MEMBERS OF THE DEMOCRATIC HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES SITTING IN FRONT OF HIM.
