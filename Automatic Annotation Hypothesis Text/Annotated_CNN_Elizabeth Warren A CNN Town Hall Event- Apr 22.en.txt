 WELCOME TO THE STAGE PLEASE SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN.
 HI. HI.
 ITS GOOD TO SEE YOU.
 HAVE A SEAT?
 ARE WE GOING TO DO STUDENTS?
 LETS GO RIGHT TO IT.
 IN THAT CASE I WANT CLOSER.
 HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE ONES IN THE BACK.
 I WANT TO START WITH YOUR BIG ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY ABOUT COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY.
 IT COULD IMPACT A LOT OF STUDENTS HERE.
 I WANT TO BRING IN DENA MILLER FROM MASSACHUSETTS.
 SHYS A JUNIOR STUDYING HISTORY. DENA.
 HI SENATOR.
 I LIKE SO MANY OTHER STUDENTS HAD TO TAKE OUT LOANS TO PAY FOR MY EDUCATION THAT I WILL BE PAYING FOR YEARS.
 WHAT IS YOUR PLAN FOR STUDENT DEBT?
 THANKS FOR THE QUESTION DENA.
 THIS IS THE AMERICA WE LIVE IN NOW.
 BASICALLY TO GET A SHOT AT A MIDDLE CLASS LIFE YOUVE GOT TO HAVE SOME POST HIGH SCHOOL TECHNICAL TRAINING TWOYEAR COLLEGE FOURYEAR COLLEGE MAYBE GRADUATE SCHOOL DEPENDING ON WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOURE ENDING UP DOING.
 THE POSITION OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN GOOD LUCK TO YOU YOURE ON YOUR OWN.
 THE ONE THING THEYVE DONE THETHEY H HAVE DONE IS LENT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO STUDENTS.
 IT IS CRUSHING THEM.
 MY PROPOSAL IS TO SAY THIS ISNT RIGHT.
 WHAT WE HAVE TO DO AS A COUNTRY IS ROLL BACK THAT DEBT.
 SO I HAVE TWO PARTS TO THE PROPOSAL.
 PART ONE IS THAT WE SAY THAT WERE GOING TO ROLL BACK STUDENT LOAN DEBT FOR ABOUT 95 OF STUDENTS WHO HAVE DEBT.
