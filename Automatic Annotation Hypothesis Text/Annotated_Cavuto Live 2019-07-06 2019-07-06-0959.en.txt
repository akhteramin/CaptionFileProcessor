THIS WAS A RESTAURANT RIGHT HERE IN RIDGECREST AND T WAS A SLIGHT AFTERSHOCK BEFORE THIS AND EVERY ONE THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH A FEW IN THE LAST DAY BUT THE 7.1 THE WHOLE BUILDING WAS SHAKING DISHES CRASHING ON THE GROUND AND YOU COULD SEE PEOPLE IN DISBELIEF SOME HITTING THE GROUND IN TEARS AND SHORTLY AFTER WALKING OUT OF THIS RESTAURANT WE LOOKED INTO THE DISTANCE AND WE SEE A HUGE PLUME OF SMOKE WE GET CLOSER AND REALIZE THIS HOUSE IS ON FIRE AND THIS IS AT LEAST ONE HOUSE THAT WAS SET ON FIRE A LOT OF THESE FRTED BECAUSE OF RUPTURED GAS LINES.
WE ARE ONLY HEARING OF SOME MINOR INJURIES AND THINGS FALLING ON PEOPLE REPORTS OF ANY DEPTH BUT THE GOVERNOR HAS DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY HAS REQUESTED A PRESIDENTIAL DECLARATION HELP FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
WE HAVE SERIOUS INJURIES THERE ARE SOME BUT HOW MUCH HOW SERIOUS THE INJURIES THEY ARE HOSPITALS HAVE BEEN EVACUATED IN SOME OF THE POWER LINES AND GAS LINES HAVE BEEN BROKEN SO WE NEED TO GET IN AND FIND OUT WHAT WE ARE DEALING WITH.
WE JUST HAD SUNRISE IN CALIFORNIA IN THE LAST HOUR SO IT IS CRUCIAL FOR US GETTING INTO RIDGECREST AND AFFECTED AREAS TO SEE WHAT DAMAGE WE ARE TALKING ABD THERE ARE SOME INJURIES BUT WE DONT KNOW HOW MUCH ANARD INSIDE THEIR HOMES.NT TO GO WE NEE WHAT NEEDS THEY CAVUTO WE HAVE NOT HEARD REPORTS OF SIGNIFICANT INJURIES.
THE SECOND EARTHQUAKE HAPPENED RIGHT BEFORE SUNSET DARKNESS PREVENTED US FROM DOING A LOT.
NEIL WE GET ANECDOTAL REPORTS A PEOPLE AFRAID TO SLEEP IN THEIR HOME SO THEY ARE IN THEIR DRIVEWAY OR SLEEPING OUTSIDE THEY ARE THAT ANXIOUS.
IT HAPPENED YESTERDAY EVENING THAT WAS THE MAIN EARTHQUAKE AND THE ONE ON THE FOURTH OF JULY IS BEING CALLED A 4 SHOCK.
IT HAS BEEN 48 HOURS IN THE SHAKING HAS BEEN VERY VIOLENT AT TIMES AND PEOPLE WANT TO BE OUTSIDE TO FEEL A LITTLE SAFER AND THE PROBLEM IS WHAT WE HAVE EARTHQUAKES IS CANT PREDICT WHEN THE NEXT ONE WILL HAPPEN.
I HAVENT BEEN IN RIDGECREST BUT I DONT BLAME THEM.
