So much of the area under active flash flood warnings and these are the worst, most dangerous type of flooding we can have, because flash flooding happens very quickly.
It could catch you by surprise and it only takes a foot, two feet of water, to push your car off the road.
So that's why you hear turn around, don't drown.
The good news is that up in Frederick at least, the heaviest rains are done, but even Howard County now under a flash flood warning 'til 11:45.
