Now moving down toward Alexandria here, just about to Franconia.
So our friends down in Mount Vernon and Lowertown and areas of Prince George's County outside the Beltway there.
Just generally South of Joint Base Andrews over toward Clinton and Melwood and Upper Marlboro, get ready as this whole mass of water is moving down towards you with that flash flood warning until 11:15, and Prince George's County, and we are gonna see better weather.
Once we get rid of this stuff this morning, we'll see the activity shift off to the South and West as we get into the afternoon.
