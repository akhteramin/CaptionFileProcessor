Jumia, PagerDuty, Tufin, Levi Strauss, which is one of the few profitable companies, all doing great.
Lyft is one of the few companies still to the downside.
No companies next week Brian but the week after we'll probably get another slew, maybe iHeartMedia, maybe next Friday a week from tomorrow, maybe we'll get Uber giving us some terms.
We'll see, not quite sure yet about that.
