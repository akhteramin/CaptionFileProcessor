If you take a look at the markets overall, nixed only because the NASDAQ is lagging off by about 1/10th of 1%.
Still though, the S&P up by about three points and the DOW Industrials just about 100 points to the upside.
That's pretty decent overall, we'll see if that sticks.
One particular industry group to focus on, the transportation stocks.
