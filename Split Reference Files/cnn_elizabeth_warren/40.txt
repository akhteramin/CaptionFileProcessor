As a young Massachusetts voter and aspiring police officer who's lived through countless tragedies, including the recent murders of Sergeant Gannon of Yarmouth and Officer Michael Chesna of Weymouth, how can you assure me that you will support legislation that keeps law enforcement safe?
So that's a very good question.
I appreciate your asking it.
You know, I talk with a lot of people in different parts of the criminal justice system, people who are in law enforcement, people who are in the judicial system, people when they are incarcerated, various parts of it, and what all of them tell me is we've got a problem.
