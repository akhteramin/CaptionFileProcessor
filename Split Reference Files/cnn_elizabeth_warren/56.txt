You're going to lose.
All I can say is, Democrats, get a better message.
But people said to me, you're going to lose because Massachusetts in 2011, according to conventional wisdom, was not ready to have a woman senator or governor.
We never had and people said it's just not going to happen, not at least for another generation.
