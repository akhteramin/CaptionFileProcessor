And there was an incumbent Republican, a very popular Republican incumbent who had the Senate seat and he was coming up for reelection.
Understand, he had high approval ratings, he had a bucket of money in the bank from Wall Street, and he had just beaten a woman who was really good and everybody thought was going to win.
So, I start getting these phone calls from people and they say, Elizabeth, you should run against him for the Senate seat.
You should do it.
