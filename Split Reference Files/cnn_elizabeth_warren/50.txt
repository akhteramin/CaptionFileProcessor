Hi, Senator.
So, this isn't as much of a policy-based question.
But some have voiced concerns about you getting Hillaried in the election, meaning that you get held to a higher standard than your opponent for potentially arbitrary or may be even sexist reasons.
So what lessons have you learned from 2016 that will help you to kind of navigate these situations when you might be criticized for something that's partially motivated by sexist?
