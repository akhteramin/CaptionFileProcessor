You built that great business or your ancestors did using workers that all of us helped pay to educate.
You got your goods to market using roads and bridges that all of us helped pay to build.
You are protected in your factories with firefighters and police officers that all of us helped to pay.
And we say, good for you, that you have now gotten this great fortune, but 2 cents.
