It is the president coming to the people's house at the invitation of the people's house, which underscores that our democracy is about checks and balances, and that the president, whether he likes it or not, needs the Congress to pass his agenda.
Although we hear from the president, especially this one, in a variety of ways, on Twitter, we have impromptu press conferences, but as an occasion, do you feel that the State of the Union retains its power?
I think it retains its power in a general sense because it is the president speaking to all of the government assembled, as well as the American people beyond and the world, who are listening to what he has to say.
In this particular case, I think it does him a disservice.
