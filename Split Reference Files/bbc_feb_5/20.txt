I think the State of the Union Address is perhaps President Trump's most unnatural venue.
It is, at its best, an opportunity to call for unity, which President Trump does not do, he speaks to his base, he is divisive, is an opportunity to speak the truth, which we know President Trump doesn't do.
It's an opportunity for careful rhetoric, and we know that President Trump is careless at best with his rhetoric.
We'll see how he does tonight, but President Ronald Reagan started this tradition of mentioning in his speech people that he had brought as guests.
