Lady Gaga served up multiple looks for her grand entrance to the event, all created by Brandon Maxwell.
It started off with a huge pink dress, that took an army of men with umbrellas to wrangle, she then stripped down to a black dress, followed by a skin tight pink dress, and then it all ended up with her posing in her underwear, here it comes.
Yes girl, with huge platform shoes.
Serena Williams wore this stunning neon yellow Versace gown, with pink feathery leaf accents, and she paired her look with neon Nikes.
