Cardi B won the award for the biggest train, with this red feathered, Tom Brown gown.
The 10 foot long train, nearly took over the pink carpet, and Cierra might have won best hair of the night, I think she won, let's be honest, with this very extra, gorgeous afro.
She also wore a custom Peter Dundas emerald green crown, because she is a queen, and Zendaya had a fairy tale moment at the gala, transforming into Cinderella, in this Tommy Hilfiger ball gown, with white poofy sleeves, and a skirt that lit up, yes, yes, yes.
Sam, you drink some water, we'll talk.
