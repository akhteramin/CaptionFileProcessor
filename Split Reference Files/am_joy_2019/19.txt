So it's a huge and I'm able to be there for the parade and there's just this kind of complete procession of military vehicles.
There are missiles, there are tanks, there are armored vehicles, there are Jeeps and it looks like an army amassing for an invasion.
And so someone turns to me and says, do you do the same thing in the United States on the 4th of July.
I said no, this would never happen in the United States because they in the United States believe, we believe that there should be a really clear distinction between civilian authority and military might and that our authority is supposed to, at least in theory stem from our laws and our moral beliefs.
