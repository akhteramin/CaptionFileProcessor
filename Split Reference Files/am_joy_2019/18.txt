That is a different position, fundamentally different position than a state in which the personality or the authoritarian leader is the head of all interests and ideas within the state.
And so what Donald Trump did, was essentially hijack this idea and turn it into something that was supposed to glorify himself.
This kinda interesting paradox here which is that several years ago, I did a Fulbright Fellowship and I spent an entire semester in Moscow teaching at Moscow State University and at the end of the semester, there was the May 9th Celebration.
Anybody who has been to Russia or knows about their history post World War II, May 9th is a gigantic celebration that happens each year, somewhere between the 4th of July and New Year's and it is a recognition of the Soviet defeat of the Nazi threat, an existential threat that confronted them during World War II.
