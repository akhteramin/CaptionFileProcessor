We just saw two natural disasters in the state of California.
So this is a time when the federal government actually has priorities that are important, that we should be spending money on.
Things like making sure, that states are ready for natural disasters like you just saw in your state.
So when you see the President of the United States diverting money so that he can have planes fly over him rather than spending the money on important things like that or maybe uncaging children, which he's also doing in the state of California and Arizona and other places.
