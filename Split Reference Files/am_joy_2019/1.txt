This week on America's birthday, known as Independence Day or simply July 4th, Donald Trump threw himself a party.
Ever since he saw that the French president has a parade, it's called Bastille Day and the dictator of North Korea has a parade, it's called Authoritarianism, and that they get to have tanks and people marching in front of them and saluting them and all that stuff, he's wanted to have one too.
He tried to co-opt other holidays to get his parade like Veterans Day or Memorial Day but the adults in the military kept pushing him back.
Well no more.
