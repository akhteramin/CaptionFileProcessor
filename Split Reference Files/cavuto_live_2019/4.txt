Yeah, you could really hear the panic on people's voices.
This again, was a restaurant right here in Ridgecrest and there was a slight aftershock before this and everyone sort of, they'd been through a few of 'em in the last day.
But then this next one, the 7.1, the whole building was shaking, dishes were crashing on the ground and you could see some of the people out there, just walking out in disbelief, some people hitting the ground, coming to tears.
And shortly after walking out of this restaurant and collecting ourselves, we look off into the distance and we see a huge plume of smoke.
