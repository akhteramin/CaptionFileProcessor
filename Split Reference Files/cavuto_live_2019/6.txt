Neil. All right, Jeff, thank you very, very much and as Jeff pointed out, the California Governor Gavin Newsome has already declared a state of emergency in at least San Bernardino County as officials assess the damage, brace for more.
And that's what has everyone on tenterhooks, what kind of more does that mean?
How much more, how significant? On the phone with us is Public Information Officer from California Governor's Office of Emergency Services, Bryan May.
Bryan, thank you for taking the time.
