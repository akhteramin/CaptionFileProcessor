Yeah, Neil, I would say there's a general feeling of uneasiness.
Two days, two big, massive earthquakes, right here, near this town in California and this latest one, a magnitude 7.1.
It is followed by several aftershocks, within just the last few minutes or so while we were waiting to speak with you, we felt several of them out here at city hall.
And that uneasiness is leading towards many people just not wanting to sleep inside their house last night.
