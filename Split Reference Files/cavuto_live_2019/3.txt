In fact, we caught up with one sheriff's deputy who told us, while they were out patrolling, going street-by-street to make sure people were okay 
and accounted for, he saw a lot of people either sleeping outside or coming here to city hall, where there is a shelter set up.
Now I want to go to a moment here, maybe we can pull up the actual sound on this, this was the moment we were at a restaurant.
We started to feel the rumbling, the violent shaking and this is what happened right after that, take a listen.
