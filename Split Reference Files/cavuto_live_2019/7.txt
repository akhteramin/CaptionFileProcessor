How are things looking there now?
[Bryan] Well, we've been working overnight since this second earthquake happened yesterday evening.
Unfortunately for us, that second earthquake happened right before sunset, darkness prevented us from being able to do a lot of assessment overnight.
We've just had sunrise here in California in the last hour or so, so right now is crucial for us, as we're getting into Ridgecrest and into the affected areas, to see what kind of damage we're talking about.
