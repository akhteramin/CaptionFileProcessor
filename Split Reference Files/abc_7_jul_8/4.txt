 Here's our FutureCast. This is the high resolution model. We're gonna stop it for you at two o'clock and look at how quickly this model has those storms popping up.
 They don't move very fast. Could bring heavy rains to the District, Arlington and Alexandria four pm and continue as we move into the all important six o'clock, seven o'clock hour.
 If there's any good news here, by eight o'clock tonight, showers become more limited and then the fireworks display is set to begin at 21:07 should go on at least according to this model here although the cloud deck may be a little bit on the low side.
 Worth watching and we're going to keep you updated.
