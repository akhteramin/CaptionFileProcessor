 The National Independence Day Parade is just kicking off.
 That happened just a short time ago and for now, it looks like the weather is cooperating but we are bracing for some storms and our Steve Rudin, he's got the timing and he is tracking all of this for us.
 Steve, happy 4th to you.
 Same to you Lindsey and we are looking at the greatest threat for those stronger storms or heavier downpours later on this afternoon into the early evening hours.
