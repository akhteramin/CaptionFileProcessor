So here's what I'd do specifically I do support debt-free college.
I also believe that what we need to do is we need to allow students to refinance your student loan debt.
And in particular I am supporting an initiative that would allow you to refinance your student loan debt such that it would be on par with the federal lending amounts.
So for example if you, probably none of you here, but any of your older brothers and sisters.
