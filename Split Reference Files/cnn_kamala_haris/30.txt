I've been spending a lot of time.
I think a lot about education in terms of every aspect of it from student loans, to what we need to do to pay our teachers their value.
And the number of teachers who have left the profession of teaching, 'cause they can't afford to pay off their student loans.
Right now we're looking at actually a deficit of teachers based on the number of students that we need to actually teach and the few teachers we have especially rural areas.
