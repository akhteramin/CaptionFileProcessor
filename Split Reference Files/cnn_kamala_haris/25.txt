I know so many students who have graduated who are making decisions about whether or not to have a family.
Based on the burden of their student loan debt and being concerned about whether they're gonna actually be able to get through the month.
We cannot afford to have a system like this especially for young people who have made an investment of their time and their resources.
Because they actually want an education to live a productive life and contribute to our society and be leaders.
