If you took out student loans between the years of about 2006 through 2013 the interest rate was about 7%.
What I am proposing is regardless of the interest rate at the time that you took out your student loans, that upon repayment it would have to be at 3.5%.
The other thing is this, part of the issue is in terms of repayment.
There is no connection between what you owe and your income.
