Two days ago was the 20th anniversary of the Columbine Massacre.
But still two decades later no major gun control legislation has been passed.
So my question is as president, how will you go about keeping our schools safe and keeping guns out of the hands of those who should not have them?
Thank you Ben and I'm sure that there are plenty of students here who while you were in high school, even middle school, that you had to participate in a drill, right.
