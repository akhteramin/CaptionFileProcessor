For whatever is not covered but let's be clear about it.
Medicare for all under the plan that I am supporting will extend coverage.
So whereas right now it does not cover dental, vision, hearing aids.
Under the plan, Medicare for all it will cover those needs will be covered, there will an extension of it.
