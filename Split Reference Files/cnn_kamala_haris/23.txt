Angela Garrazzo is here and she is a freshman at Saint Anselm College studying International Relations.
She is from New Hampshire, Angela.
Good evening Senator my question is as a college student with over $25,000 of debt in my first year alone.
What will you do to alleviate the financial burdens of the student debt crisis?
