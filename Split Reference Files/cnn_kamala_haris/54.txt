Why do you support it?
I support it because I to my core know that the climate crisis is representing an existential threat to who we are as human beings.
We have had supposed leaders who are buying science and pushing science fiction instead of science fact.
And this is to our collective peril if we don't take this matter seriously with a sense of urgency.
