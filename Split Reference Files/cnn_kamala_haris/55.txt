Why I support the Green New Deal is because it does that.
It puts timelines in effect, it appreciates that we need to take this seriously and the clock is ticking every day on this issue.And every day we fail to act, will be to our collective consequence.
The UN has already said over the next 12 years if we don't get this straight there will be severe consequence.
And this is within our ability to do something about it.
