How do you respond to the 74% of Americans who wish to have the option to keep their private insurers?
Well I support Medicare for all and I support it for a number of reasons.
That include the fact that there are a lot of people in our country who simply do not have access to healthcare 'cause they cannot afford it.
And that's unconscionable and I actually believe it's a moral issue.
