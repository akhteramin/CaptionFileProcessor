I'm Cecilia Vega in for David and we begin with that bombshell verdict in the war crimes trial of a former Navy SEAL.
A military jury finding Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher not guilty of murdering a captured ISIS fighter.
Gallagher was convicted of a single crime, taking a photo with the body of a dead captive.
Gallagher was deployed to Iraq in 2017 when the incident took place, his own platoon turning him in.
