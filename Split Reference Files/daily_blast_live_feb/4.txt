I'm here with Tory, Jeff, Al, and I'm Sam.
And if you haven't noticed, we have a very special guest co-host.
You all know him as Dr. Drew Pinsky, but you're so much more to me.
I know you've heard this a gazillion times by now but you're not only a friend, you're my mentor, and I really do owe sitting in this chair to you.
