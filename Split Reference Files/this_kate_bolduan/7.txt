What is a little bit unclear to us at this moment is we were under the understanding that earlier this week an investigation had already been under way.
The posts were said to have been turned over to the Internal Affairs at CBP, DHS.
Inspector General has also said to have gotten their hands on these social media posts.
A broader question though Kate, we're also wondering if he's calling for an investigation into these social media posts?
