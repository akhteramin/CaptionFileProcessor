We're hearing from acting DHS secretary, Kevin McAleenan about those social media posts.
Remember earlier this week Kate we reported, ProPublica, the investigative team first reported about this closed Facebook group that featured current and former they say, Border Patrol agents making lewd comments, derogatory comments, racially inflammatory comments, joking about dead migrants.
Well, now Kevin McAleenan the acting DHS secretary tweeting this this morning.
I have directed an immediate investigation, and as the U.S. Border Patrol Cheif has made clear, any employee found to have compromised the public's trust in our law enforcement mission will be held accountable.
