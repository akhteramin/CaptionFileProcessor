In February 1992, Kurt married the former stripper and lead singer of the band, Hole, Courtney Love.
As soon as she married him, I listened to a lot of his poetry, and a lot of his music and I thought, well this guy's pretty profound.
I think he was popular because he was wounded,
he looked like a person who was down on his luck and rebellious.
