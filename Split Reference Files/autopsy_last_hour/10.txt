Kurt is at the Exodus Recovery Center in Marina Del Rey.
He's trying to kick the heroin addiction he's developed since becoming a rockstar.
One of the people he smoked a cigarette with outside, said that Kurt just seemed like a happy-go-lucky guy, he didn't seem like he had a problem in the world.
He seemed very excited about life.
