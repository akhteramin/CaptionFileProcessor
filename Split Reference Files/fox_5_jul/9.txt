No problem, temperatures start out very mild, around 80 degrees.
Near 90 by the lunch hour, and then we'll be watching for those showers and thunderstorms in the fireworks time.
I think most of the heavy-hitting action will be over with, you know, the severe weather, by nine o'clock.
But there could be some lingering rain.
