Instead, they sent a statement simply saying, The Department of the Interior is committed to providing the American people a fantastic celebration of our nation's birthday.
We are doing so consistent with the Department's mission and historical practices.
I do wanna mention, we still don't have a final total price tag for this event tomorrow,
