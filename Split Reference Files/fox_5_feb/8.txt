It could be closer to the three inches though with snow because the changeover now appears as though it'll be sometime in the late morning.
Out here, the changeover's a little later.
We could get a rate of snow one inch per hour for a few hours in the morning and that's where you'll get your pile up, but unfortunately for all of our area, this may end, especially in the northern and western suburbs.
Everybody west of 95 has to watch for the potential for significant icing as the temperature begins to, the temperature a lot begins to rise and changes that snow over to that combination of sleet and freezing rain.
