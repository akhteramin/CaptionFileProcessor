What I'm concerned about is how much snow we're gonna get.
I have three boys, so they're gonna be working.
So, between snow, freezing rain, or at least freezing precipitation, and then possibly some ice, this is expected to impact the next three rush hours.
Vedot told me tonight that because this is starting with snow and it's expecting to accumulate, they will be in the sub-divisions as well, and they and all of the area officials are asking that, in your neighborhood, try to park in a driveway or all on one side of the road, that way the plows have an easier time getting by.
