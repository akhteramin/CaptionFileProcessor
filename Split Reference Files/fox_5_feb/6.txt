As we start with snow that we now see showing up, especially south of Interstate 64, that will continue to spread from southwest to northeast over our area and by the time you wake up tomorrow morning, by sunrise, I think you will see snow outside.
This is all starting to push up.
Now, we do not expect much accumulation for southern Virginia.
They'll start with a little bit.
