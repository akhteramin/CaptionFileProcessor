Metro Bus will operate under severe snow service plans.
So, that means buses will provide limited service on major roadways only, and Metro access will only provide return trips home for customers between four a.m.
and seven p.m. All other trips will be canceled.
And remember, you can track the weather 24/7 on the FOX 5 Weather app.
