The shooting happened this afternoon near the Fort Dupont Ice Arena in the Southeast.
The gunman shot two men and a child, one man is critical, the other two are expected to be okay.
Tonight, police are looking for a silver Hyundai that might be connected to the shooting.
Good news for Southeast DC families who rely on the Fort Dupont Ice Arena, the city's only full-size, public, indoor ice rink, will get a much needed facelift thanks to a deal reached between Mayor Bowser and the friends of Fort Dupont ice arena, the non-profit that runs that rink.
