Back to you in the studio.
Several area schools are already out of snow days, in fact, tomorrow's storm will send more schools over their days budgeted for weather cancellations.
Montgomery Country used its two make up days already.
Howard County used its four make up days, if they have to miss any more, the school district will have to appeal to the State Board of Education and ask for forgiveness, or make adjustments to the school calendar.
