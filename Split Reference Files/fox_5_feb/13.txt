Sarah, it's incredible to watch these guys do their work, filling up truck after truck with salt and sand.
They are heading out to the interstates from this saltdom in Fairfax, and they are asking for help from the public tomorrow, when all of this wet stuff starts coming down.
If everybody stays home, hang out, watch the Channel Five, it would be great for us.
Stay home, stay home, stay home.
