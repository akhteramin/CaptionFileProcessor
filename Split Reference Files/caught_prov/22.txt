You've a parking ticket on Thayer Street, sir?
Yes.
That day I wasn't driving the car, I was just getting out the hospital, 'cause I had brain surgery and my son literally parked at the corner of CVS and I got in the car and the lady said, You can't park there, it's a fire hydrant, and I said, oh, alright, I understand, I've had brain surgery, I had my helmet on and then she says, Yeah, sure, she didn't really believe me.
I got in the car and then we left and then I got in the mail, the ticket, she didn't even give us a ticket on the way she was or anything.
