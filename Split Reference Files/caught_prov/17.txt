Alright, here's what we're gonna do, Mr. Giacobi, I'm gonna watch it.
Now there are two lines on Allens Avenue, there are two stop lines, if you are passed the first stop line, when the light turns red, I'll dismiss it, if you're not passed it, it's gonna cost you 85 bucks, we're gonna take a look at it, look up here.
[Ziggy] It's already red, judge, show the time link, it was red for 16.2 seconds, judge.
If I look at this, I look at this every day and I'm supposed to know that when the light clicks three times, that it's red, I'm supposed to know that, I think we're all supposed to know that.
