But I want Mr. Holder to know that this doesn't give you a license in the future to say it's okay, I'll bring my counselor down, I can get away with it, okay, I'm doing this based on his representation.
Do you understand that?
You explain it to him, when he gets out, 'cause he's homeless, okay, alright.
It's our intention to avoid it, if at all possible, thank you, Your Honor.
