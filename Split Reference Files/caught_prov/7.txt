Is he homeless now?
Currently speaking he lives with his father at an assisted living residence in East providence, but actually we have an appointment next week with the Gateway group to hopefully line up housing, affordable housing in North Providence.
Tell me about the program, I don't know what the program is about.
We're a social services agency, we're under the Horizon Group, we have two locations, one in Providence, one in Warren, Rhode Island, you know, in the East Bay area.
