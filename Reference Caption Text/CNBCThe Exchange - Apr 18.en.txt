- Darden Restaurants, I think that that one is a good one right now. I think they're going to continue to raise and beat in the restaurant sector per my Analyst Lin Collier at Luke Capital, we're going with it. 
- [Scott] All right Kate Moore, always good to have you here. 
- Yeah, consumers what I'm watching the most next week during earnings. I think we're going to get a lot of different reads about the staples and the discretionary side with unemployment at multi-decade lows, wages growing. I think this is the big thing that can change sentiment. 
- [Scott] Okay, Weis, quick, what do you got? 
- [Weis] Illumina. 
- [Scott] Josh Brown? 
- [Josh] I'm going with Twitter. 
- Motorola Solutions MSI. 
- All right, good stuff. Thanks everybody. Good weekend, good holiday as well. The Exchange starts now. 
- And thank you Scott. Hi everybody, I am Brian Sullivan in for Kelly Evans today and here's what's ahead: D.C. and Your Money. Politicians in America will debate the meaning of the Mueller Report, but we ask could it lead to even more gridlock and standstill in D.C.? We're going to review the impact on your money ahead. Pinning and conferencing, Zoom and Pinterest hitting the market to a lot of investor fanfare, but could they suffer ultimately the same fate as Lyft shareholders? Plus, a fold fail, a cannabis consolidation, a recyclable shoe, you heard that right, and a new legal smoking age. That's what's ahead in Rapid Fire. It's a big league show with lots to do, but as we always do let's start with Your Money. Dom Chu is here now with a DOW that is up, what? 
- Almost 100 points and stable right now for the most part Sulli. If you take a look at the markets overall, nixed only because the NASDAQ is lagging off by about 1/10th of 1%. Still though, the S&P up by about three points and the DOW Industrials just about 100 points to the upside. That's pretty decent overall, we'll see if that sticks. One particular industry group to focus on, the transportation stocks. The iShares Dow Jones Transportation ETF, which tracks the Dow Transports, right now the highest levels that we've seen going all the way back to December third, so Transport's a big part of that story. Union Pacific earnings better than expected, that's driving the trade there and if you're looking for one of the stocks of the day that's not Zoom, that's not Pinterest, check out Blackstone. Look at this, 8.5% gains. A publicly traded partnership for private equity that's going to become a publicly traded corporation, that new structure giving a boost to those shares. A lot more investors could come in the mix and they raised a lot of money, Brian, for their funds last year, back over to you. 
- Yeah, Schwartz been on Squawk Box talking that up this morning. Dom Chiu will see you in it a bit, thank you very much. All right so and the markets that Dom just walked you through have two new members to welcome into the fold today. Of course you've heard the names, Pinterest and Zoom both are now public, both rising. Just adding to the list of names, including some very under-the-radar ones. that have done very well when they hit the tape. Bob Pisani is at the New York Stock Exchange with more and Bob, Zoom, what a day. 
- Both of them. I mean not only, the floodgates have really opened Brian, not only did they raise the terms going into it but they popped at the open as well. Let's just take a look here. Pinterest, very simple. Price talk was 15 to 17, they priced it at 19 but wait a minute, it opened at $23.75 and take a look at it in intraday trading here, on very heavy volume here, they're gonna trade the whole float today. It's holding up very well, up $24.35. Zoom though, 28 to 32. Just four or five days ago we were talking about 28 to 32 for Zoom. It priced at 36, that's not a typo. It opened at $65. This is very rare to see something that essentially opens twice as high as anybody thought it would a week ago and you see a trading right here at $63, just off that number. Of course it's profitable, A lot of people like that. It's got 100% growth and those are the two magic words that we've got. Recent IPOs that joins the parade, they've done really well. Jumia, PagerDuty, Tufin, Levi Strauss, which is one of the few profitable companies, all doing great. Lyft is one of the few companies still to the downside. No companies next week Brian but the week after we'll probably get another slew, maybe iHeartMedia, maybe next Friday a week from tomorrow, maybe we'll get Uber giving us some terms. We'll see, not quite sure yet about that. 
- Big stuff there Bob Pisani, thank you very much. All right now to Washington because the other big thing to hit the tape today was the Mueller Report. It is perhaps more heavily redacted than many had thought or hoped, but at 400 or so pages long our team is still pouring through it. Eamon Javers live at the White House with what we have learned so far. Eamon, your key takeaways. 
- Yeah, Brian that's right. We are still trying to digest this 400 page report and going through it for all of the details here. The headline is out there and the President's been saying that throughout the day, no collusion, no obstruction. That's good news for this White House. Inside the document we're finding some of the areas of concern for Robert Mueller particularly around the area of potential obstruction of justice and the President's public statements, his tweets even about some of the people involved in this whole situation, those were red flags from Robert Mueller in certain circumstances. Particularly on this idea. 
- All right so when we get Eamon back up, we're gonna come back and talk more about that certainly here. Somebody pulled the plug literally on Eamon there as well, but luck we've got a couple smart folks surrounding us right now to dig more into this. Let's talk more about what this all means for Washington, the markets, and policy going forward. We're gonna CNBC this story. Let's bring in Libby Cantrell Head of Public Policy at PIMCO. CNBC's own Ron Insana and John Harwood as well. Libby, I'll begin with you. The Democrats are gonna complain, it's too heavily redacted. We need to investigate further. Republicans will say this is all over. What we're probably going to end up with is a bunch of this. Where do you see policy making, infrastructure, anything else, going forward? 
- Yeah, I mean I think this is hitting through a partisan lens. I mean to your point Republicans are sort of claiming vindication here, that there is no collusion, and Democrats may walk through the door that the Mueller report opened in terms of investigating further, whether there is actually obstruction of justice. I think you'll hear louder calls for even then maybe the beginnings of impeachment hearings for the President among the progressive left. Now I think Speaker Pelosi will do everything that she can to try to not heed those calls, but the point is that look, I mean Washington has already been, is already polarized. It is already partisan. There was not much moving legislatively anyway, but the big things that President Trump does want to move legislatively, one is is the NAFTA replacement, the USMCA, NAFTA 2.0. And that might be harder to move now with a more kind of fractured relationship-
- 
- Do you believe that Ron, to Libby's point that this report will in some ways infect what should be bipartisan or nonpartisan purely economic negotiations? 
- Yeah, I don't think there's any escaping maybe the overhang that Libby alluded to, which is that within the obstruction of justice component of this report Bob Mueller effectively punted to Congress and suggested in the absence of his being able to do anything under the Office of Legal Counsel, which says you cannot indict a sitting President. He really suggested that Congress, to a certain extent, take this up. So to the extent that they're not only one, maybe distracted or even obsessed by this, it will slow down the legislative process and create even more I think fractures between the Democrats in the House and the White House itself. 
- You know John when Barr's letter came out, the four pager, people said okay this is over. It appears to what Ron is maybe suggesting that maybe we are just getting started on a second phase of this. 
- Well I think that's because Barr's letter was such a brief summary of this and the report today gives us a lot more detail as Eamon was saying before somebody pulled the plug, that a lot of detail about the potential obstruction that the President had engaged in orders to Don McGahn then the White House Counsel to direct Rod Rosenstein to fire Robert Mueller. The special counsel began refusing offering his resignation then ultimately staying on a while longer and telling aides that Trump had asked him to do crazy stuff. I think all of that and to Libby's point earlier, I think it was the right one. I believe that the way the administration through Bill Barr in the initial release of the letter and then today's press conference in which he seemed to be spinning for the President trying to blunt the impact of the report, I think that's going to make it more difficult for Speaker Pelosi to resist those in her caucus who insist on an impeachment proceeding to weigh this in a way that they think is searching and fair. 
- Yeah, and Eamon Javers by the way is alive and well. I just want to point that out he is back. Somebody pulled the plug, but not on him literally. So Eamon-
- 
- There's no censorship here. 
- No censorship here, he is back with us as well. 
- He's not redacted. 
- You know you've been there day in and day out for us Eamon. You've seen the sort of the back and the forth inside. You know the Speaker's chamber and talking about this with Sarah Sanders and and one wonders how much more of any dialogue that we have is simply going to be about the report from now on? The administration can want to talk about defense spending or infrastructure or immigration or whatever it is and every question is going to go back to this report with the exception of maybe yours. 
- Well, you know that's right. I mean first of all this is a White House that doesn't brief the press any more, right? So they're not going to face this public televised spectacle of the White House trying to get out its line of the day and reporters just asking them on camera about the report. You're gonna see the President leaving here shortly this afternoon a couple of hours and reporters will ask him questions. I expect he will talk. He's been tweeting vigorously today. He has a lot he wants to say about this, so I expect we're gonna get lengthy comments from the President today. But in talking to some of the officials here, I don't get the sense that they're gonna rebut much of this at all. It's possible that they're just gonna let this sit and retreat to the headline conclusion of no collusion, no obstruction and on some of the smaller things just let all those go. For example, there's some stuff in here about Sarah Sanders and exactly how she responded to the Comey firing by suggesting that FBI agents inside the bureau had lost confidence in Comey and that they'd heard from countless members of the FBI who said that they didn't like Comey. Apparently in her interview with the special counsels team, she admitted that you know that didn't have any basis in fact and it was either a slip of the tongue or she just kind of said it at the time and didn't really base it on any actual factual basis. Those smaller things it doesn't seem like the White House is going to address at all. They might just let them all go. They're content with the win here and they feel like they've had a big positive political day. 
- Yeah and Brian I'm not sure how much of a win there is. I mean I got through about the first 50 pages of the report and there's some even materiality when it comes to the question of whether or not the administration or I should say the campaign expected to benefit from Russia's actions in interfering. Not rising to the level of criminality, which Robert Mueller suggested, but from a market perspective this may as Amy just alluded, in many ways turn neutral insofar as we're seeing a resynchronization of let's say Chinese and American economic growth. Europe's the outlier at the moment. We're seeing the Fed back off, we're seeing central banks around the world start to stimulate. So if indeed today's retail sales number were any indication of where we're going from here then the market may just return it's attention to fundamentals and maybe ignore some-
- 
- Ron, dang you for bringing right back down the CNBC lane because that was perfect and I want to talk about that. It's amazing, the retail sales number better than expected. Jobless claims under 200000. GDP revisions, they are going up at Goldman Sachs and others today Libby. It's amazing that this is getting all the headlines and if you just focused on this you'd think this is the only thing happening but outside of this America rolls on and the economy rolls on and the President will have a strong economy most likely behind him in that reelection. 
- Yeah, most likely and our view of him, is that we likely will see sort of two, 2.5% growth here in the United States for 2019. You do have the effect of fading fiscal stimulus and you got a big fiscal impulse growth from the tax bill that was passed in at late 2017 and then also a big government spending bill that was passed in 2018. From a policy perspective and from kind of tying this back to markets, another area though of this kind of Mueller report that could inform relations with Congress, that could be relevant, is this idea of the fiscal cliff of 2020. And the markets are not focused on this right now, this is something we're talking about with per clients and talking at PIMCO go about and that's because if Congress doesn't step it and keep spending levels at the rate that they are now, come January 1st of 2020 we could see a half a percent headwind to economic growth because of this big drive down in spending now. I think we all, Washington folks are you know, understand that Congress is expedient. They're going to want not want to do that going into it-
- 
- Well they may want to do that. 
- John Harwood, John Harwood. 
- Brian, I just wanted to make one point, which is that in terms of the effect on the legislative agenda, there really isn't much of a legislative agenda. In theory the administration wants an infrastructure plan, but Republican leaders in Congress don't and the kind of plan the administration wants is not what Democrats want so other than the USMCA, which is significant, there isn't much that congress might do in the absence of this Mueller report so I think that's important and-
- 
- John, let me ask you, let me ask you Libby's point if I can because we're running out of time. Do you, to the fiscal cliff discussions, do you believe it's not only because the report but maybe the report layers on, that the US Congress, Democrats and Republicans both, will play economic chicken with the fiscal cliff and the US economy? 
- I doubt it. I don't think Democrats approach these issues differently from Republicans and while they'll fight for their policy priorities, I don't think that a Nancy Pelosi led House would engage in the degree of brinkmanship that we've seen in the recent past. 
- Let's hope. 535 men and women fighting while 310 million others may suffer. John Thank You, Eamon thank you, I'm glad to see you're alive and well. Ron Insana, Libby Cantrill, thank you all very much. All right we are just getting started here on The Exchange. Here's what else is coming up.

- Hi, welcome back. With so much talk about the possibility of an economic slowdown it's important to look beyond just the government data. Jim Cramer told you as much on Mad Money the other night. So let's do more of that by diving into BB&T's latest quarter. Joining us exclusively on The Exchange is Kelly King, the Chairman and CEO of BB&T. Kelly it's great to have you on the program. So much discussion about a possibility of a slowdown. How is BB&T seeing loan demand? 
- Well glad to be back. Long demand is actually very good. Actually production is very high. Our pipeline where we kind of measure all of the applications in process are at an all-time high and so we're seeing a broad-based level of confidence, a broad-based level of willingness to borrow money, to invest in plant and capital equipment. So overall it's very good. You know on the street doesn't match up with a lot of the kind of national rhetoric that you hear. 
- And in your experience, your long history Kelly running a bank, do people borrow money, do businesses borrow money when they sense a slowdown is imminent? 
- They do. Brian, it's interesting. 
- They do?! 
- Yeah, they do. I travel around and I talked to lots of business people one on one and so when I talked to them they talk about their business. They're interested in chatting about the national issues but when you get right down to what they're going to do, they focus on their business. So if their actual market, if their actual business is slowing down then of course they'll reduce their investment. But if it's just a lot of general conversation, you know they'll talk about it, it might cause them some uneasiness, but when they go right back to the office they'll focus on running their business. 
- From all the numbers though in the quarter and the year so far Kelly that you have seen do you believe we will be in a recession in 12 to 18 months? 
- You know, I actually do not. I'd be honest six or eight nine months ago I was a lot more concerned about the possibility of that. There was just so much rhetoric about it's been 10 years and after a while everybody begins to you know, have that effect you a bit. But as I've gotten out and traveled around and talked to business people and I've seen the strength. I mean just what you've been reporting just in the last hour so. Strong retail sales, low unemployment, low jobless claims, underlying strong GDP, no major geopolitical risk, it seemed to be eminently problematic. I don't see, in certainly the next 12 to 18 months I do not see and eminent slowdown. I think that you could have some existential factors that could cause that but I don't think it's predictable at this time. 
- One thing that stood out to me that was a little bit shocking I guess Kelly, is that your net interest margin, NIM, rose only two bits. (laughs) Literally a tiny percent. 
- We take what we can get. 
- I know but it rose even as interest rates collapsed in the first quarter, how did that happen? 
- Well we have a very, very strong what we call core deposit funding structure. We're like a really big community bank. We operate a regional bank structure. We're in a lot of rural areas. We're in metro urban areas as well, but we have a lot of stable deposits. They're not as price sensitive, they're more focused on relationships. A lot of small business clients and so our NIM pressure is more a function of what's happening in our local markets than it is in the national markets. So when you hear a lot of national discussion about changes in NIM, it doesn't inherently affect us. Now sometimes if we do some external large and negotiable instrument funding that'll move our NIM around a little bit. But in this particular quarter what we really saw was that our funding was increasing but our rate of return on assets was increasing at a faster rate. 
- You know one quick last question. You're paying an advertising agency a lot of money to come up with a new brand between SunTrust and BB&T when you merge. Can you give us some kind of a of a hint as to what that's shaping up to be? Because SunTrust and BB&T could mosh together like some kind of kids drink if you're not careful. 
- Yeah. Well you know Brian, the reason we decided to pick a new name versus using either one of the others or some combination is because our merger is about improving profitability, which it does enormously. But it's much more importantly about leaning forward about major investments and innovation and technology. It's about really getting excited about meeting the needs of the clients in terms of technology and trust, kind of that blended relationship between technology and the branches. And so we want a name that kind of a points forward that excites our clients, excites our associates, and excites the market in general to say this is an institution that is moving forward, is energized and trying to take care of the community at large and the clients in particular, and we think we can find such a name. 
- Good luck. You're a bank, Kelley King we do wish you luck. Appreciate that, have a good Easter, thank you. 
- Thank you, you too. 
- All right, on deck, the trade war comes home. How China and Wisconsin are now in a fight and it's over with some say our Foxconn's broken promises. But first, to the moon Zoom.

- All right, welcome back. Pinterest and Zoom may be getting all the headline love today but they are not the only names that you need to know about. Here are some of the other movers at the hour. Sketchers, a shoemakers sinking after missing earnings and sales estimates. Second quarter profit guidance was also below forecast. That stock is down. On the flip side Honeywell, it's up. They posted strong results and they also raised their full year forecast. Companies saying it saw strong demand for its aerospace products. And Travelers is taking a journey higher today, leading the DOW. The insurance company beating EPS estimates but it did miss a bit on revenues. Travelers though also did raise its dividend and that stock is higher. All right now let's get to Contessa brewer with a CNBC news update, Contessa. 
- Hi there Brian. Here's what's happening right now. Democrats vying for the party's 2020 Presidential nomination including New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand are condemning Attorney General William Barr for acting like a defender of President Trump. She had some harsh words about Barrs' news conference this morning. 
- The Attorney General of the United States is supposed to represent the people of the United States. He's not supposed to represent President Trump. And by having this press conference today that is misleading the American people was not appropriate. 
- A French judicial police official says investigators think an electrical short-circuit most likely caused Notre Dame's Cathedral fire. He says the investigators still don't have the green light to work in the cathedral because of safety concerns. Rescue services use two cranes to pull out a bus, which crashed on Portugal's Madeira Island. Killed 29 German tourists and injured 28 people. The bus was lying on its side was part of its roof torn off. That's your CNBC news update this hour. Brian, send it back to you. 
- All right Contessa, thank you very much. Well a pair of Technology unicorns, billion dollars of the public market are surging after their public debuts today. Pinterest pricing above the high end of the range at $19 a share and opened up 25%. That sounds good until you hear this. Zoom video communications, the ticker ZM, priced at $36 a share but only opened up 80%. Lets those talk about both and start with Pinterest. CEO Ben Silbermann telling Squawk Alley the company is more about utility for people to get things done and less of a place to talk or for friends or to follow celebrities. In other words, we are not a social media company. For more let's bring in Doug Clinton Managing Director at Loop Ventures as well as our own Leslie Picker. Amazing response to Pinterest. Are you surprised? A 25% pop. Either the bankers screwed up in pricing it or people really liked Pinterest. 
- People do like it and to your point, it's a discovery platform. It's really not a social network although we think it will be comped like a social network. So I think the good thing about Pinterest is it's a great business. They have this unique data asset where people tell Pinterest how they see the world in pictures, how they categorize the world. The problem is companies like Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, the companies that will be comped on Pinterest are trading six to eight times next year's revenue. Pinterest at this valuation is closer to 11 times. So it feels like the market is already pricing in a lot of that great business. 
- I mean first off, I think the term social media is outdated and dumb. I mean let's just be honest. It's just media at this point. That said, do you think there was a strategic reason why the CEO of Pinterest kept saying we're not social media, because he didn't kind of want that stain. 
- Yeah, I think social media is a bad word right now. I mean you look at what's happening with Facebook and Twitter. 
- It's two words John. 
- Two bad words combined into one. I think you look at Facebook and Twitter and sort of what's happened with them and public sentiment around, especially privacy on Facebook, but also the the conversation just politically. The discourse is very difficult on both platforms. Pinterest talks a lot in there S1 about empowering their users. I think that's a very different message than what we're seeing Facebook and Twitter do with their users where you have FOMO and depression. 
- You know what's amazing Leslie Picker? Besides you by the way, is that if a stock falls 25% everyone screams Wall Street really screwed that up. If a stock rises 25%, nobody's saying anything. It's still obviously 25% mispriced. You see where I'm going with this? 
- Yeah, it's tough to price an IPO perfectly and if it closed flat today people would complain about that too. But in terms of Pinterest, this company sold primary shares only which means that all of the money raised from the IPO went back into the coffers of the company. There were no selling shareholders that were raising money to fund their own pockets. So what that means essentially is if you do see a 25% pop, that is a loss of capital, that is money left on the table that Pinterest could have otherwise used to reinvest in their business. Now that said, it is important to keep investors happy with these IPOs. You want investors who are kind of gonna stick around for the long run through that six month lock-up period, which expires in about 180 days. You want people that can stick around and the best way to make them happy is to make the money Brian. 
- Yeah, it certainly is. All right let's move on now to Zoom Video because if you thought Pinterest was doing well and by the way it is. Nobody's taking anything away from 25% gains. Zoom, new ticker ZM, soaring. Up more than 75%. Let's bring in Deirdre Bosa from San Francisco. Deirdre, okay Zoom getting a lot of love, but it also faces a lot of competition. 
- That's right Brian and I think Zoom's performance says as much about the company as it does about all the other big enterprise tech names out there who haven't been able to capitalize on this video conferencing software. You've got a very crowded field here. You've got Microsoft, which has been pushing Skype for Business. Cisco's WebEx, which Eric Yuan actually works for and then Zoom seemingly comes out of nowhere and sort of takes this field and is the leader and known to be easier to use and part of the reason for that is because it started in the cloud. Some of the other competitors and big names in this space started on antiquated conference call or chat software so that's been one of its big successes and I think that also speaks to the argument and some of its risk factors. How could it continue to compete against these very well capitalized big tech name competitors. Eric Yuan has built a company that was just more simple and easier to use. That's when it strengthened. You can understand how it may be continuing to use these strengths to expand into different verticals like telehealth and education. 
- All right Deirdre Bosa in San Francisco, Leslie Picker in New York, Doug Clinton here in Englewood Cliffs. Guys, great discussion, thank you very much. Here's what's ahead on The Exchange. 
- [Announcer] Coming up cannabis consolidation heats up. Could big changes be coming to the tobacco world? Plus a recyclable sneaker and a fold fail. It's all ahead in Rapid Fire.

- This is a legal alert for users of Roundup Weed Killer. Roundup Weed Killer has been designated as a probable human carcinogen by the World Health Organization and in July 2018 a judge determined that all federal law suits could move forward against Monsanto, the maker of Roundup Weed Killer, over concerns that those exposed to Roundup are at risk for developing non-hodgkin's lymphoma. And in a landmark 289 million dollar verdict in August 2018 a jury concluded that Monsanto's Roundup Weed Killer and Ranger Pro Herbicides contributed to a school grounds keeper's non-hodgkin's lymphoma. Roundup Weed Killer is the most commonly used weed killer in American agriculture. If you or someone you love has been diagnosed with non-hodgkin's lymphoma after being exposed to Roundup or glyphosate herbicide, you may be entitled to compensation. How do you fight for the compensation you deserve? You choose the right legal team that has the experience, support staff, and resources to seek the most compensation for your injuries. Call now.

- I'm going to incorporate your key into your mobile phone. 
- [Announcer] The Shark Tank 'Life Made Easy' Marathon. Starts tonight seven eastern. CNBC, get yours. Brought to you by Xfinity. 
- All right, welcome back. Let's catch you up on a few stories that should be on your radar right now. They call it rapid-fire and here with their takes we have Bill Griffith, Kate Rodgers, Frank Holland. Only one of you will emerge alive. 
- Yes, I know. Are we gonna get a word in edgewise here, my friend? 
- No, that's why it's gonna be good. First off-
- 
- Shots fired. 
- We haven't even started. 
- I want to survive. 
- You're in, you win. 
- Yes. 
- All right, first up Senator Mitch McConnell announcing a bill that will bump the national minimum age to buy tobacco from 18 to 21. It's just a bill, not of law yet. It would also apply to vaping products and we should note, some states in America already have a minimum age of 21 so this would be kind of a symbolic move to four states to do it. Frank Holland, it's kind of your beat here. What's the reaction, what do you think? 
- Well listen, there's also a similar House bill called the Scott Act named after outgoing FDA Chief Scott Gottlieb. Here's the thing, a lot of stats we can throw out here. Here's just another one, 90% of current smokers tried a cigarette by the time they were 18. This is really a public health initiative and I think it makes perfect sense. There's 16 million Americans with a smoking related disease in America right now and it's a problem. 
- Let me play the cynic here. This is the tobacco industry trying to get out in front of any regulations that are going to come their way. Why now after Scott Gottlieb had already gone after the vaping companies because there was a 75% increase in the use of those by teens. Now all of a sudden we have legislation and surprise, surprise, the tobacco companies are supporting said legislation to raise the minimum age to 21. 
- It's amazing Bill, right? After they have these pods for vaping that are basically candy flavored. 
- Exactly, yes. 
- And JUUL the maker of many of those is actually in support of 21 years to buy tobacco, but I mean the McConnell release did have some disturbing things in it including that middle schoolers we're starting to vape as well. We hear so much about teens and kids in high school doing this and I totally agree with the marketing. It does seem like candy and you don't necessarily realize there's nicotine in it. It is not good for you. 
- By the way, there's more nicotine in it in many of these cases than in regular cigarettes. 
- All right, so it's bout time they go to 21 anyway. They should have done that years ago. The drinking age is 21, why not the smoking age? 
- Well I understand you but a lot of states, a lot of towns, they've already raised it, so I just think it makes a lot of sense and two things can be right at the same time. It might be good for tobacco's business somehow, some way, but it's also good for public health. 
- [Bill] Of course. 
- Look I'm gonna ask you this Kate because you are the youngest one on this fine panel, which is do you believe that raising the, and I'm not asking you to reveal any personal details about high school but do you believe that raising the age of something does prevent people from doing it? 
- I think if there's a will there's a way. I was an angel in high school and I am still today, but I'm just saying. 
- [Bill] You still are. 
- But I think if kids want to get their hands on something, you know we can prevent it by putting laws like this in place but again, like I said, when there's a will there's a way. 
- Probably a kid named Will selling JUUL pods at the high school. All right, topic number two. Kind of related. Cannabis consolidation. Canadian weed giant Canopy Growth striking a 4.3 billion dollar deal to buy Acreage Holding. That deal however will take effect after cannabis has been legalized in the US. While legal cannabis sales have been climbing this year so far the black markets also been rising. What's the future Bill of this industry? 
- You know what I find interesting about this deal, this is almost like a futures contract for Canopy. What they're doing is locking in a price for Acreage. 
- [Brian] It's an option. 
- But at the same time I wonder why Acreage would do this deal if they're locking themselves into, it's a 43% premium over the company's valuation right now, but what's to say that they couldn't see an even higher valuation after we do inevitably see-
- 
- So Bill Griffith you're saying that this could be actually a sign of lack of optimism by Acreage Holdings. 
- By Acreage Holdings, yes, but Canopy I think is making a very smart plan. 
- Oh, that's what I was just gonna say. Acreage is a multi-state operator. It's in about 20 states already. Obviously this is contingent on federal nationwide legalization, but really smart move for Canopy and also Constellation, which I know you have your eye on but-
- 
- Yeah absolutely, great move for Constellation. Yeah, they have some warrants where they can, similar option, they can decide to buy more stake in Canopy but a lot of people are talking about the cannabis play. Me, I'm looking more at the Acreage business and the people they have on it's board. They have Bill Weld a guy who's running for President, former Governor of Massachusetts. They also have a former Prime Minister of Canada. So I really feel like Canopy maybe buying that influence, because that's this is get down to business. Weed's a commodity. Everybody's gonna be able to grow it. 
- By the way, it's not the weed of yesteryear. 
- So I've heard. 
- I'm told. All right up next, let's talk more about recyclable shoes. 
- [Bill] She told me by the way. 
- [Kate] He told me, I think he heard it from you. 
- [Brian] You might have. Adidas just released a new running shoe, get this, made from 100% recyclable material. Once your shoes have fallen apart, I assume they will fall apart, you can return them to Adidas where they recycle for the components to make a new pair of kicks. Zion Williamson-
- 
- [Bill] I was just gonna say. 
- Should be there spokesperson. I think he's probably already signed with Nike. What do you think, gimmick Kate Rodgers, or real deal? 
- It sounds like Adidas wants to get this right. I think it says they're giving it to about 200 runners to test them out, they're not releasing the mass market yet because they want to make sure that they really--
- 
- [Brian] How long do they last? 
- That they really get this right. Well whenever you're done, you can hand them back over to Adidas and I think more broadly consumers do care more and more about this. We see more companies paying attention to being eco friendly, marketing things in this way. 
- [Brian] Do they care? 
- I think they do care. 
- You know what they care about more? Not rolling their ankle or having their knees hurt while they jog. 
- Yeah of course, but now recycling is becoming a big business right now. That's pointing to that and as we all know actor Jason Momoa just shaved his beard for the obvious reason that he's promoting aluminum as a recycling thing. 
- Stop the presses, we gotta end this show. Khal Drogo has shaved, here's the thing. Frank, don't come at this as a business journalist. You're a six foot five inch dude. I don't know if you run, I'm not quite your height. Listen, we run, it hurts. 
- [Frank] Absolutely. 
- The shoes got to work first and foremost. 
- Zion Williamson was perfect, a perfect example that if the shoe can't hold up it's a problem, but I'm gonna be the cynic this time. This is really differentiation. Adidas has been trying to increase it's market share. A couple years ago they signed a Kanye to a sneaker deal. He's not really running anywhere, but those sneakers sold like hot cakes. 
- But those sneakers are so cool, yeah, he doesn't need to run anywhere. 
- Hey, you ran that marathon? What's your shoe? It's a gimmick, it's the new Adidas gimmick. 
- So like you said, recycle it. 
- Finally, we're moving on. remember how much hype Samsung's foldable phone generated? It's got a $2000 price tag, but here's the problem some reviewer guys who got this phone early reported that it broke. In fact our own Todd Haselton CNBC found the screen was flickering after just two days. There's the video from our own Todd Haselton. Samsung, a real problem or they just haven't figured it out yet? Bill? 
- I think it's a bigger problem right now. Novelty is a big sales item for technology. This was novel to have the folding phone but I think they're getting ahead of themselves now. They're rushing products to market before they're ready and they cost too much now by the way. $1980 for a foldable phone. It's becoming too complicated and too expensive. 
- Well call me old-fashioned, but I don't need my phone to fold in half. I need it to have a nice camera, good reception, and kind of look cool but I don't care that much. I wouldn't buy this. I'm not who they're marketing to. 
- I'm gonna tell you though, this is the battle of the sexes though. I will say this women and men phone differently, we keep our phone, we tend to keep it here or in our like jeans pocket. 
- Back pocket. 
- Yeah, having a phone that can flex a little bit when you're a guy helps out Frank, does it not? 
- But the phone doesn't flex it, it folds. 
- Yeah, but you could put it here. The point is you could put it maybe in this pocket a little bit easier. 
- I don't know about that part, but here's the thing I actually talked to Todd about this a little bit deeper. He says that the resolution on the screen isn't as good and the colors aren't as good so if your whole selling point is that it's a bigger screen and the screen's not as good as your other phone, you might be missing the mark. 
- Todd's the smart guy, I don't know if he did this, but I do know Samsung claimed that some of the reviewers accidentally, there's a protective screen, they took it off thinking it was removable. 
- He didn't do that. He did not do that. 
- Okay, but apparently some people did but it's not a removable thing. They peeled the screen off. 
- He actually tweeted up close photos that he did not do that and his screen still was flickering. 
- Bottom line Kate Rogers, yes or no, $2000 dollar phone? 
- No, not for me. But you you need to get it right. We talked about apples wireless charging mat that they pulled from the market because they said it wasn't ready. This is a great example of why it needs to be ready. 
- I have a question. Where's the button? Kelly's got these, I press a button and you and you fall into the alligator pits. Where are those buttons? 
- And then I survive? 
- You survived. 
- All I can say is I'm exhausted now. 
- Come on WEX one morning. Trending stories of Bill Griffith.

- All right, welcome back to The Exchange. Foxconn back in focus today with it's Wisconsin jobs pledge now being called into question. Governor Tony Evers telling reporters that he wants to renegotiate the deal saying the company will not be creating the 13000 jobs that it pledged. For more on this big story let's bring in one of the reporters that has followed that story from the beginning. Rick Rimmel business reporter for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. All right Rick thank you very much for joining us. I mean CNBC was there, we were in Kenosha as well. A lot of promise, what appears to be falling through the cracks here? 
- Well you know we're all sort of waiting to see whether the Foxconn will come through on what it has said it would do and I think it's fair to say that the progress toward those goals has been slow. 
- How slow as in slow we're getting there eventually or slow as in the car is not actually moving down the highway? 
- The car is moving, it might be moving at I don't know, 25 miles an hour or something. They've made multiple changes to their plans for plant. Initially they said it was going to be what they call a generation 10.5 flat screen plant, which is the largest most expensive type of plant in this industry. Finally, middle of last year they acknowledged no, we're not going to build a generation 10 plant. It's going to be a generation six plant, smaller less costly and then a month or two ago it looked like they were thinking about backing away from building a factory at all in Wisconsin. Then the President, Donald Trump, gets on the phone to Terry Gou, Chairman of Foxconn. All of a sudden within hours Foxconn comes out with a statement saying yes we will build this smaller type of factory. Foxconn continues to maintain it'll create 13000 jobs. A lot of people in Wisconsin just don't, they're not buying it. 
- I was gonna say listen Rick, do you believe and the sources you talk to? Heck, do your neighbors believe that this plant will ever get built? 
- Personally yeah, I think there's a good chance that something is going to be built there. I mean they already are, they have construction underway so they've prepared a very large like, I don't know. It might be 60 acre site that has gravel compressed down tight to be the bed for the foundation of the plant. They let contracts about two three weeks ago for like 34 million dollars worth of preparatory work for the actual building construction and that part is under way as far as I can tell and they say that this summer they will start building actual physical vertical construction itself. 
- When they do that you, let us know, you take pictures, we'll get you back on CNBC. Rick Romell, thank you very much. 
- You bet, thank you Brian.

- All right, welcome back. A new op-ed ad on CNBC highlights America's growing need for financial education programs, especially for economically disadvantaged children. It is part of our financial education initiative called Invest in You: Ready, Set, Grow. And it's in partnership with micro investing app Acorns and joining us now is the author of that piece, Nan Morrison the President and CEO the Council For Economic Education. Also a member of our CNBC Financial Wellness Council. It's amazing Nan, you can be in high school and take classes on the Peloponnesian War and not understand how to balance a checkbook. Why? 
- That is quite amazing. 
- No offense to the Peloponnesian War. 
- Exactly, exactly. But we don't do a good job of getting financial education into our nation's K through 12 schools and that's the mission of our organization to do that, to teach those K through 12 kids about personal finance and economics so they can make better decisions, so they know how to manage their money, to balance the checkbook, to make decisions about a credit card or a loan, to make good decisions about those. 
- Now without getting into the politics of school districts and unions but it's hard to get classes, new classes created. What's the best way to do that and what's been the holdup for just saying hey, maybe you don't need that 14th history class. Let's talk about how not to go bankrupt. 
- One of the great things about what we do is we teachers and we help them with the content, we give them lessons and we also teach them how to integrate it into the everyday life of their classroom. So think of creating a mini economy for little kids in a K through five classroom. Think about integrating it into math instead of those crazy problems about the Amtrak trains. How many times have you thought about how fast that other train is coming at you? No, but you think about what your investments are doing. So we should be teaching those examples in math or another business oriented classes. 
- And the weird thing about this area in particular is you've got Wall Street, literally Wall Street, I mean the physical street with the New York Stock Exchange on. 
- It's right there. 
- Blocks away. Our kids with nothing and no education. How do we bring those... They're physically this close, how do we make them work for each other? Right? It benefits everybody when everybody benefits. 
- It does. Well, there are a couple of things that we're doing. We're running Family Financial Literacy nights at schools where volunteers can come with parents and teachers and kids to learn about money and we also have a new program, Invest In Girls, which not only helps girls to get introduced to the language and grammar of finance but also takes them to places. So it introduces them to the world of finance, to people like you and me and some of the women here at CNBC, the great ones. So that they can see there's a possibility of a really interesting career working in finance. 
- And you point out that families of professionals, their kids have 30 million more words than kids on welfare. A lot of those words are financial related. Financial words can be scary sometimes even to adults. Right? How do we de-intimidize, is that a word? 
- How about demystify? 
- Thank you very much. 
- Any time. How do we demystify or make finance less scary, how about that? 
- Yeah, I think we just need to talk about it more. It's just like any language. Once you start speaking it, learning the words, it's less scary and you don't need to know all the complicated stuff. You just need to know like hello, please, thank you, and where's the bathroom, and if we can teach the kids the basic language and grammar of finance when they're little, same as when we teach them everything else, then it's easy. Then they're not afraid to ask the question. 
- [Brian] Or make up words during segments on vocabulary. 
- [Nan] They can do that too. 
- Nan Morrison, great stuff. Important topic, thank you very much for joining us. 
- Thanks so much for having me here. 
- Of course, I don't want to de-intimidize you. For more you could visit cnbc.com/
