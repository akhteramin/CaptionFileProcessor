- [Carrie Ann] It's Thursday, February 14th, Valentine's Day, and The Talk is live. Empire star, Jussie Smollett, speaks out for the first time since his attack last month. He tells Robin Roberts he's not just angry at the men who beat him, he's also outraged at the skeptics who doubt his story. Desperate for fame and likes, a wannabe Instagram influencer posts herself throwing a chair off a building's 45th floor balcony. Is your sex drive in sync with your partner's?

Find out how his wife, Hailey, is helping him and what they are putting on hold. Then our neighborhood is about to get a whole lot funnier thanks to the stars of the hit CBS show The Neighborhood. Cedric The Entertainer and Tichina Arnold are here. So let's start talking. [Music] We can talk it, we can talk it out [Music] [Music] So what you got what you got [Music] [Music] What you got now [Music] [Music] We got now [Music] [Music] So let's talk it out [Music] 
- Hello and welcome to The Talk. Happy Valentine's Day, everybody. Let's get started with Empire. 
- [Audience Member] Happy Valentine's Day! 
- Happy Valentine's Day. 
- Happy Valentine's Day. 
- All right, let's get started with Empire star Jussie Smollett, speaking out for the first time after his attack. It's been two and a half weeks since Jussie said he was attacked in Chicago by two men who yelled racial and homophobic slurs, punched him, wrapped a rope around his neck, and then doused him with bleach. Because police said Jussie initially refused to turn over his phone records and that the ones he did eventually give them were heavily edited and redacted, some people have accused the Empire star of lying. Today Jussie sat down with GMA's Robin Roberts to set the record straight. 
- I'm pissed off. 
- What is it that has you so angry? Is it the attackers? 
- It's the attackers, but it's also the attacks. Wanting me to give my phone to the tech for three to four hours. I'm sorry but I'm not going to do that. 
- Why? 
- Because I have private pictures and videos and numbers. My partner's number, my family's number, my castmates' number, my friends' numbers, my private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos. I don't know what that's gonna be to hand over my phone. 
- While Chicago Police have screened lots of footage from neighborhood security cameras, they still have not found video of the actual attack. Jussie shared his frustration. 
- I want that video found so badly because for probably four reasons. Number one, I want them to find the people that did it. Number two, I want them to stop being able to say alleged attack. Number three, I want them to see that I fought back, and I want a little gay boy who might watch this to see that I fought the (beeping) back. It does not take anything away from people that are not able to do that, but I fought back. They ran off, I didn't. 
- And we have this new update from Chicago Police who announced they are questioning two persons of interest in connection with Jussie's attack. Police stress neither person has been charged with a crime, and as of now, there is no evidence they were involved. So do you think speaking out is the best way to shut down skeptics? 
- [Audience] Yes! 
- Oh absolutely, and I've got to side with Jussie on the thing that I don't want my phone to be looked at. All my nude shots and things. 
- More specific-
- 
- Yes! Hours and hours. Hours and hours of sexual footage of myself. I wouldn't want my phone to be taken away and analyzed. I just wouldn't want it. Not for anything other than it's my personal life on there, and I just wouldn't want it, so I totally get that with him. And I totally get that he might have deleted some things. It's hard, he's been through a really tough time. 
- Yeah, and the media has really cast so much doubt on his story, which I find so personally offensive. That a gay black man is targeted, and then suddenly he becomes the victim of people's disbelief. It's so outrageous to me. There have been things like well why would he be getting a Subway sandwich at two a.m. He said himself, well they're open at that time because people go; otherwise, they wouldn't be open. 
- We go. 
- I go. 
- Or people say in that neighborhood you couldn't get a taxi. Says who? It's just like these sort of ridiculous things where I feel like why don't we believe this person, why? 
- It really is sad, and with all that he has been through, the fact that he has to come out. But at the same time, because of social media, there are so many opinions, it's better to hear it from his own mouth and hear it from him and feel his energy, and I'm glad with everything that has happened, I am happy that he's being brave enough to sit with Robin Roberts and share his story. 
- And if the naysayers know so much about what they think happened, why you don't know who did it? 
- Exactly. Since you know so much, since you know so much, just tell us what you know. I hate the fact that we are in a social media. Even the common person. Usually it's the celebrity and their fans and their followers. Now it's even the common person who may have something happen to them that they're going to their supporters or whatever for acknowledgement. That's why people don't want to talk. That's why people don't want to come forward. Because they're gonna be judged. And that doesn't help the situation. 
- Well what I hope that the police are on to something with these two persons of interest. I hope they get them, and that people have to look at how as a media and as culture we twist things and cast doubt on things that we should not cast doubt on. 
- And hear them apologize, will people apologize. When the truth come out, will you apologize? As hard as you judged him, will you apologize? 
- Hope so, but I doubt it. 
- In other news, a 19-year-old wannabe Instagram influencer with less than 4,000 followers threw two chairs off a 45th-story balcony in Toronto over the weekend, presumably to get more likes. Now she's been arrested. The CBC has details. 
- [News Anchor] The video of a woman tossing a patio chair off the balcony of a Toronto high rise takes your breath away. People are stunned as they see it for the first time. 
- It's ridiculous, why risk peoples' lives for a moment of just Internet fame essentially? 
- [News Anchor] Below that balcony, the Gardiner Expressway and lots of foot traffic. Police think it was two chairs, found crumpled in a heap at the base of the building. 
- She has been charged with endangering life and has now been released on $1,500 bail and ordered to live with her mother. So do you think all social media platforms should ban her for life? 
- [Audience] Yes! 
- Oh yeah, I mean here is a perfect example of a young person who wants instant fame, the recognition, everything that comes with it, for nothing except being stupid, ignorant, no talent. Why would you, 45, I can't even believe that the window opened on the 45th floor, but, however, it did, and her chucking. Can you imagine if that had hit a car and that car would have crashed into another car and another and another? I mean, the thought of it just makes you shiver. It's just ridiculous that these wannabe kids out there think overnight they're going to get fame and fortune for being pathetic. You are a pathetic young girl. She wants to be an influencer. Well why don't you work on your writing. You want to influence people, work on something. You don't get something worth having overnight by being ridiculously ignorant as you are. 
- It's sad. 
- Yeah, and it's over likes. That's not even a real thing, people. Priyanka Chopra Jonas costars in the new rom-com, Isn't It Romantic. She tells Extra that her new husband, Nick Jonas, is super romantic, take a look. 
- You haven't been married for too long, but what is the most romantic thing in the theme of Isn't It Romantic that he's done for you? 
- Oh my god, the night before we were getting married, I was doing a bridesmaid's hangout in my room. When we opened my room to come in, there was a lane of flowers all the way with about 18 or 19 gifts with little notes on each one, like I will protect you, I will always keep you safe. It was just like, everyone was crying. 
- He wins, that's amazing. 
- He does. He wins life. 
- What's the most romantic thing anyone's ever done for you? 
- For me, my husband is the king at romantic gestures. He's on his way to come see me right now. This morning I woke up, and he posted this before his flight. And I'm like it just melts my heart because honestly he's amazing. He is just great. 
- Aw, romance. I like romance. 
- Audience, tell me, how can I get this kind of romance? I wanna ask the audience, what do you think guys? How am I going to get that kind of romance in my life? Anyone, nobody has any suggestions? Any suggestions? 
- You're out of luck. 
- Any advice please? Yes, yes, yes, ma'am? 
- I'm so nervous, I'm so excited. 
- Come on down. 
- So excited. 
- My name is Vanessa, and I wanted to sing a song to my fiance. Oh my god, I'm so scared. 
- I don't know who that is. [Music] Hi Dolly, I love you [Music] [Music] I'm making bad right now [Music] 
- You look gorgeous. 
- So surprised. 
- When we walked out, I was like looking at the ceiling, what's going to drop, which person is she gonna to be. 
- Look what I did. 
- Oh my god. 
- Look what I did for her, I covered my tattoos. I tried to get rid of my gap for her. 
- Before we came out, again, I looked at the schedule like no, she's got a meeting from 10:30 to 12, she can't torture me on the air. 
- Happy Valentine's Day.

- [Announcer] Melissa McCarthy and the secret life of George Washington, this Sunday morning. 
- Are you ever in the mood but aren't sure your partner is? An Ohio couple has come up with a unique solution. They call it LoveSync. And they're raising money for it on Kick Starter. Take a look. Love Sync is a device that lets you know when both of you are in the mood for some hippity-dippity. 
- It's super simple. All you have to do is place a button at each of your bedsides. And when you're feeling a little randy, you just anonymously push the button. There is no risk of rejection. If only one of you pushes the button, nothing happens, and your partner is none the wiser. But, if your partner's also ready for a pants off dance off, they'll press their button. The Love Sync technology combines these anonymous inputs and recognizes that there is consensus. It lets you both know by emitting a swirling glow from the buttons. 
- Serious question, do you feel like you and your mate's sex drives are in sync? 
- Well first, the button is unnecessary. Why don't you just poke me in the back or tap me on the shoulder like most people do? I got enough gadgets in my nightstand. I don't need this button. 
- I was just saying to the girls, I think it's gonna be like a joke gift to give out for birthday gifts or when someone's getting married. A silly little novelty gift. I think it's gonna be like the pet rock. Useless, but everybody got one. 
- I think it's kind of cute for some reason. I think it's kind of cute, but I can also see a fight between people like I pushed my button! 
- There is no way for rejection, but there is rejection. 
- There is rejection. 
- If the person doesn't push the button back, you feel some type of way, it's weird. 
- Since Linda was just out here, are you and Linda's sex drives in sync? Would you tap your buttons at the same time? 
- I'm not going to answer those kinds of questions. 
- Here's the bigger story part. So what if you're pressing the button, but I'm asleep and I don't see you pressing the button? Or what if the button gets jammed? 
- Well, they're not that far away that they can't unjam at you. 
- I'd rather use my batteries for other things child. 
- There are people who are more forthcoming than I am. Have you guys ever had relationships where you're in sync or not in sync? 
- I've had both, I've had both. Me and Max are pretty good. 
- These are things on your mind for later today. The one that got away that I think about that was like my first love when I was about 23, our sex drives were absolutely in sync. And I had a really good girlfriend in Hawaii once tell me, and her relationship has been going on, I put all my energy towards my career, but her, she's put all her energy towards her like marriage and her love life, and she says that the sex drive is the most important thing because it's how you sort of keep coming back together, that divine attraction on all levels, right? 
- I had a guy who was so out of sync that I would stay up all night just so I didn't have to do nothing. And then I would sleep all day. I'd drink coffee. 
- How long was this relationship? 
- Every time this guy calls me, and he normally calls around Valentine's Day, you know I'm busy I can't. I never thought I would be out of sync with this guy. 
- He's going to take his button and just hit you over the head with it. 
- We'll be right back. 
- [Announcer] You know that look, that life of the party look? Walk it off look. One more mile look. Reply all look. Own your look with fewer lines. There's only one Botox Cosmetic. It's the only one FDA approved to temporarily make frown lines, crows feet, and forehead lines look better. The effects of Botox Cosmetic may spread hours to weeks after injection, causing serious symptoms. Alert your doctor right away, as difficulty swallowing, speaking, breathing, eye problems, or muscle weakness may be a sign of a life-threatening condition. Do not receive Botox Cosmetic if you have a skin infection. Side effects may include allergic reactions, injection site pain, headache, eyebrow eyelid drooping, and eyelid swelling. Tell your doctor about your medical history, muscle or nerve conditions, and medications, including botulinum toxins, as these may increase the risk of serious side effects. So give that just saw a puppy look and whatever that look is. Look like you with fewer lines. Own your look with the one and only Botox Cosmetic.

- [Announcer] I was thrilled to be able to go with my friends to our annual get-together, especially after being diagnosed last year with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. 
- [Announcer] Another true story with Keytruda. 
- I started Katie on Keytruda and chemotherapy, and she's getting results we rarely saw five years ago. 
- [Announcer] In a clinical trial, significantly more patients lived longer and saw their tumors shrink than on chemotherapy alone. 
- It has changed my approach to treating patients. 
- [Announcer] Keytruda may be used with certain chemotherapies as your first treatment if you have advanced non squamous non-small cell lung cancer and you do not have an abnormal EGFR or ALK gene. Keytruda helps your immune system fight cancer but can also cause your immune system to attack healthy parts of your body. This can happen during or after treatment and may be severe and lead to death. See your doctor right away if you have new or worse cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, diarrhea, severe stomach pain or tenderness, nausea or vomiting, rapid heartbeat, increased hunger or thirst, constipation, dizziness or fainting, changes in urine or eyesight, muscle pain or weakness, joint pain, confusion or memory problems, fever, rash, itching, or flushing. These are not all the possible side effects. Tell your doctor about all your medical conditions, including immune system problems, if you've had an organ transplant, had or plan to have a stem cell transplant, or have lung, breathing, or liver problems. 
- Where I am now, compared to a year ago, it's a story worth sharing. 
- [Announcer] Living longer is possible. It's true, Keytruda from Merck, with more FDA-approved uses for advanced lung cancer than any other immunotherapy. 
- Justin Bieber is reportedly putting his wedding plans on hold because of his mental health. Justin and his wife Hailey were married in a secret civil ceremony last year and had planned to say I Do again in a religious service, but those plans were delayed while Justin seeks counseling for his depression. A source tells People Magazine that the 24-year-old has felt overwhelmed by fame. The source says being followed, having his every move stalked by fans, cameras in his face, it all sets him off, and he often feels like everyone is out to get him. Have you ever had to put something on hold to focus on your mental health? 
- [All] Yeah. 
- I think that most of us have. When life becomes, you lose control of what's going on, and you just think I can't do it, I can't. I need to take a breath. I feel badly for him because I know that a lot of people are probably saying, well what's he depressed about? He's got everything, he's got this, that, and the other, and it just doesn't work that way with severe depression, it really doesn't, and I feel really bad for him right now. I am happy that he's getting himself together, his head together, his priorities, he's got right. And I'm glad he's taking a break for himself. 
- There was a time once when I felt like, my father died right before a season of Dancing with the Stars, like four days before. As much as I felt myself going into depression, but I had to put it off. Have you ever done this as well? Where there's like a time where I had to put like a steel wall between me and my emotions so I could get through the season of Dancing with the Stars and everything that was coming. I had just broken up with my fiance, my dad died, I moved, I was diagnosed with chronic illness. It was one of those times that I knew I didn't have time. What was important is you shouldn't push off your emotions unless you know you can have a time to deal with it. That's the part that was key. I knew after the season was over, I could spend like three months just sort of taking care of myself, and I was very fortunate to have that. I've had it almost the opposite. 
- Did you feel during that time that you were acting out at all or having weird emotions kind of sneak out? 
- Yeah, they do sneak out, because emotions are emotions. They have their own template, their own desires that come out, and they will find a way out. You can put them off for like. Dancing with the Stars is like 10 weeks out of the year. So for 10 weeks I could kind of put them on hold, but they would sneak out. I would watch Dance. Andy Dick was on our show that year. He danced something, I like lost it. It was really simple, it was my own emotions with my own life coming up. 
- But then what did you do once you had that time? 
- I actually sought counseling. I love to read. There are so many great books that you can read. I bought every book I could possibly find on depression. I just went and sought my friends, my support system, I was very lucky. We'll be right back.

- I'm Darren Haynes, catch my take on sports right here, on WSA9. 
- With harsh winter storms affecting nearly every part of the country this week, snowball fights are a common occurrence, but one Seattle woman got arrested after she nearly ran over a group of people who allegedly threw snowballs at her car. The local CBS station has details. 
- [News Anchor] Joey Wiser shot this cellphone video that's now gone viral. 
- He told me he couldn't believe the woman behind the wheel of this blue Jeep would swerve past him before running straight into a group of people across the street, narrowly missing them. 
- It seems like her intention was to run them over. 
- It was a neighborhood snowball fight that went wrong. 
- [News Anchor] Rocky Moran was the person seen in the video trying to hold the woman down. He said that she got upset because her car was hit by one of the snowballs. The woman's car ended up getting stuck in the snow. Neighbors called police, and her arrest was also caught on camera. Authorities said the woman now identified is facing charges of DUI and reckless driving. 
- Oh my gosh, what is wrong with people? What is wrong with her? People need to calm down. You don't go after somebody with your car, a vehicle that could kill people, when you were hit by a snowball, it's just ridiculous. 
- And the thing is, she could have lost control of that car, in the snow, so it's so ridiculous. 
- I'm glad nobody got hurt, but I'm also glad that she was caught because she was drinking and driving. So at least she got arrested. So I'm glad she did do what she did. 
- It's a good reminder about these kind of videos everywhere, right? Even if you're not drunk. When I was at the Grammys the other day I was trying to see Linda perform her section with Dolly, and I was backstage with her, and then I went to go get seated during it. And they kept saying, oh it's a commercial, you can't go in, okay now you can't sit in your seat, and I was like, you know those moments where you're like, I have to. I was like cool it Sara, because there's videos everywhere. It's like you learn. Not that I would anyway, but you just can't take your life out on other people, which is what I always think these things are. Something else is bothering this person. 
- It's a little neighborhood snowball fight. Why didn't you get involved in the fight? She could have jumped out the car, balled a snowball up, and said I got you and then hit them. Then it would have been fun in the neighborhood. We're just not neighbors anymore. 
- Maybe it would have sobered her up too. 
- To be out in the cold in that snow. 
- We think of everything. 
- Sober up and don't run people over. We'll be right back. 
- [Announcer] Coming up next, from The Neighborhood to our table, Cedric The Entertainer and Tichina Arnold. 
- Are you ready for this?

- MBC doesn't take a day off, and neither will I. 
- I treat my MBC with every-day Verzenio, the only one of its kind that can be taken every day. Verzenio is the only CDK four and six inhibitor, approved with hormonal therapy that can be taken every day for postmenopausal women with HR-positive HER2-negative MBC.

- Please welcome our good friends, Tichina Arnold and Cedric The Entertainer. 
- Congratulations are in order because, Cedric, you were just nominated for a NAACP Image Award. 
- Yes he was! And congratulations to both of you because The Neighborhood has already been renewed for its second season and we have the moment that it happened. We have the moment that you guys found out. So Tichina, what was going through your mind? 
- My daughter's tuition. We're regular people, we're just working actors. We're blessed to be working. Beth loves twerking, she twerks at every possibility. 
- On the show itself, Max Greenfield and Beth Behrs play your white neighbors, the only white couple in The Neighborhood, but Cedric, I heard when you moved to L.A., you sort of had a similar fish-out-of-water experience. 
- Yeah, I moved into an all-Latino neighborhood when I first moved to L.A., so I had to learn there's a lot of food going come over. It's a lot of cooking going on. Corn with sauce and mayonnaise and all that. I didn't know what was going on. But it was cool though. 
- Then you actually, your Walk of Fame. 
- My star on the Walk of Fame. 
- Yes. 
- I used to walk around there of course and see all these stars. You just come to Hollywood from St. Louis. And so now, when I got my star, I was literally a block over from where I first moved to L.A. That was just kind of like so cool. 
- Hi Sharon. 
- Hi Tichina. You and Cedric have been playing husband and wife for a year now. 
- Yes. Does any of that like go on off when you're not working? Do you take care of him? 
- Oh most definitely, I don't play with his wife. Lorna does not play, and I fill her shoes as best as I can when he's on that set. So I make sure that he rests. You know he takes moments. I didn't tell you I took a video of you snoring the other day. People don't realize this man runs a whole show but he's also on the road. So he's doing comedy on weekends. I gotta take care of my Boo, my Set Boo, I make sure he's all right. Cedric is just such an amazing human being. Like literally this man I've known for 20-something years. This is the first time he and I have worked together. I have seen this man treat everybody with respect. From the person that moves the cables. To the first person there in the morning on our set. He treats everybody the same. So I'm happy to have him as my friend. 
- The great Marla Gibbs, who we all know from 227, was guest on the show this week. So Cedric, what was it like working with her? 
- I mean, of course, Marla Gibbs, is an icon. I was always a fan of 227, but when she was on The Jeffersons. I wanted to get into a little riff with her. She was funny though. She is so great, so gracious. It was just awesome to have her on the set. This iconic personality. She loved it, she loved being at work. And to have been doing it for so long that it was just really awesome for us to be able to provide that opportunity. She had a great time. 
- And she was off book. Marla has done a lot for the black community. She has done amazing work for the black community. 
- Pretty incredible, but last week on the episode, there featured a girls' trip to a Magic Mike show in Las Vegas. Did you crash the party a little there? 
- Saying hello to the gentlemen.

It airs on April 21st, and you co-hosted with Mr. Smokey Robinson and so many other incredible performers. Did you get to hang out with anybody or see anybody that you never met before? 
- The only person I really was stalking was Diana Ross, and I guess it got pretty obvious that I was stalking her 'cause her security wouldn't let me get close enough, you know. But I did the whole, went to Berry Gordy first and then, Hey Diana, how you doing? Tried it but they wouldn't let me get close to her. 
- But why? 
- I don't know. 
- I would have called Tracy, we should have called Tracy. Tell your Mama we looking for her! 
- Tichina let me ask you something that everybody's been looking for is the Martin reboot. 
- Everybody's waiting for that What can you tell us, what can you share? 
- I will share that Martin called me about a month ago, and he got some good news about a huge network wanting to take it on, so we'll see, fingers crossed. But it will never be the same without Tommy. Martin's show will never be the same without Tommy, so it's not a reboot, I call it a rebirth.
