- [News Anchor] Good Morning Washington, tomorrow! 
- [TV Announcer] From Hollywood, it's Jimmy Kimmel Live! Tonight! (audience applauding) Regina King! From The Punisher, Jon Bernthal! This week in Unnecessary Censorship, and music from Juanes! And now, in all sincerity, Jimmy Kimmel! 
- Hi everybody, how're you doing? I'm Jimmy, I'm the host of the show, thank you very much! Thanks for coming! Thank you! Welcome! Welcome to Hollywood! I appreciate that! Hey I have a story, so last night after the show I hosted a concert, there was a big concert at the Forum. It was a tribute to the late, great Chris Cornell, were you there, is that why you're yelling, okay! The lineup was incredible, it was Chris Stapleton, Adam Levine, Metallica, Miley Cyrus, Foo Fighters, Audioslave, Soundgarden, amazing! And you had fun, right Guillermo? 
- A lot of fun! 
- Guillermo had a lot of fun. 
- Guillermo was like, hey, are you going to that, it's like, yeah, yeah come with me to the show and Cleto went, and Dicky went, Jeff our keyboard player went, a few guys. At one point in the night, I think it was two-thirds of the way through the show, I was on stage and somebody yelled, where's Guillermo? So I gave Guillermo a shout-out, I said Guillermo is here, and the whole Forum erupted in tears. It was crazy, it was like, it was about the same reaction they gave Brad Pitt and so then, (audience laughing) I go backstage, I text Guillermo 'cause I wanna, kind of know what he thought, and where were you when you got the text I sent you? 
- I was at home! 
- He was at home, yeah. After Metallica he ditched us and got in an Uber and went home. (laughs) In fairness Guillermo has to go bed early because he's gotta be at work at 2:00 p.m. Today is day 27 of the government shutdown which is nuts. Remember when Trump said he'd run the government like a business? Turns out the business was Radio Shack! Trump is-
- Desperately-
- Trying to pin blame for this shutdown on Democrats, he lashed out this morning. He wrote, The left has become totally unhinged. They no care what right for our country! That's right, and you see how he spelled, he's just as good at spelling country as he is in running it, it's-
- Most of Trump's hire is directed at Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House. Yesterday Nancy Pelosi sent the president a letter suggesting he postpone his scheduled State of the Union Address, until the shutdown is over. She will not permit him to give it from the House of Representatives. So today, Trump retaliated with a letter of his own informing Nancy Pelosi that he was canceling her flight to Afghanistan. She's going there on a military aircraft, and he told her, if she wants to go she can fly commercial! Into a war zone! And, he sent the letter less an hour before she was supposed to leave. It was the presidential equivalent of, you break up with me, I break up with you! And I bet he was so delighted with himself when he came up with this idea. In fact an official from the White House said, he spent the day watching coverage of it and was very pleased this afternoon. But he may the only one who's pleased, because even some of his fellow Republicans said this was a petty thing to do, and all the Democrats are mad. This is from CNN today, reporter Phil Mattingly stopped the House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, like this: 
- We're really seeing-
- 
- Hold on one second, I'm sorry to interrupt, here's the House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, talking about what's going on-
- 
- Okay, hold on a second, because that is the most threatening microphone I think I've ever seen in my life! Gimme your money old man! Desperate times I guess! You know, if the Democrats can't convince Trump to end this silly shutdown I think I know somebody who can. Lot of people would try to make sense out of this but the clearest voice I've heard on the subject so far, believe it or not, came from Cardi B. 
- Hey y'all, I just wanna remind ya because it's been a little bit over three weeks okay? It's been a little bit over three weeks. Trump, is now ordering as his summonse, federal government workers to go back to work, without getting paid. Now, I don't wanna hear ya (bleep) talkin' about, oh, but Obama shut down the government for 17 days, yeah bitch! For healthcare! So your grandma could check her blood pressure, and you bitches could go check your (bleep) at the gynecologist with no mother (bleep) problem! 
- Cardi B is right! Almost 800,000 federal employees are not getting paid, and every night until it's over we're hiring a furloughed worker per night. Last night we brought in a NASA engineer who was out of work and now let's say hello to our new employee tonight, please welcome Andrew Rigopoulos! Andrew, come on in here! Welcome! Thank you for coming! 
- I'm here! 
- So I see this! Tell us what you do, specifically. 
- I'm an engine station ranger at Cabrillo National Monument in San Diego-
- 
- You are a ranger! And so you work in, we still have national parks correct? 
- We do-
- 
- That's a good sign, yeah? 
- Well, if people over visit 'em and damage 'em then we won't have them anymore. 
- And right now, there's nobody working at the park you work at-
- 
- No, we have a crew of rangers that actually watch it to make sure that our resources aren't damaged while we're there-
- 
- You are considered to be a non-essential government employee? 
- Yeah, I stay home and watch a lot of Netflix-
- 
- Yeah, okay. (audience laughing) Well you actually came up, usually we come up with the job, but you came up with an idea for a job, that I like. 
- Yeah, I pitched it to my brother first and he said-
- 
- What're you gonna do for us tonight? 
- Since parks are important and nature's important-
- 
- Yes? 
- I'm gonna take care of our urban landscape and water your plants. 
- You're gonna water the plants here-
- 
- Yeah-
- 
- Now we don't have that many plants. 
- No. 
- But if you see any, water 'em. 
- Okay. 
- Okay, thank you very much. 
- Thank you. 
- I appreciate it. 
- So Andrew, oh, Andrew! I forgot, we got you this! So in case you don't you have one of your own. 
- Thank you-
- 
- And by the way, if you see any funny lookin' plants, just ignore them okay? 
- Okay. 
- Thank you very much, that's Andrew, Rigopoulos! The president appears to be on a collision course with the law right now, his alleged lawyer Rudy Giuliani was back on CNN last night, and rudier than ever. He made a crazy appearance, on Chris Cuomo's show. This one, if we didn't have this on video it would almost be too much to believe. 
- The amount of false reporting about this case, is despicable! 
- Mr. Mayor, false reporting-
- 
- It's despicable-
- 
- Is saying that nobody in the campaign had any contacts with Russia. False reporting, is saying that there has been no suggestion of any kind of collusion between the campaign and any Russians. Because now you have Paul Manafort, giving poll data-
- 
- I never said-
- 
- That winds up leading to this coincidence-
- 
- Well you just misstated my position. I never said there was no collusion between the campaign, or between people in the campaign-
- 
- Yes you have-
- 
- I have no idea, I have not! I said the president of the United States. There is not a single bit of evidence the president of the United States, committed the only crime you could commit here, conspired with the Russians to hack to DNC. 
- (laughs) Wow, really! Of course he never said it. Nobody in the Trump administration ever said any of the things they say all the time but-
- (audience laughing) But there must be another Rudy Giuliani out there who's been going around saying there was no collusion, between Russia and the campaign. 
- Is it still the position of you and your client, that there was no collusion with the Russians whatsoever on behalf of the Trump campaign? 
- Correct. 
- Correct. So he did say it. The surest sign of how deeply screwed up this administration is, is that Rudy Giuliani is still allowed to go on TV, to speak on their behalf. (audience laughing) Go on, Rudy! 
- The president did not-
- 
- We said nobody had-
- 
- With the Russians-
- 
- Any contact, tons-
- 
- Whatever collusion is-
- 
- Of people are contacted. Nobody colluded, the guy running his campaign-
- 
- He didn't say nobody-
- 
- Was working on an issue-
- 
- He said he didn't-
- 
- At the same time as the convention. 
- He said he didn't, he didn't say, nobody. How would you know, that nobody in your campaign-
- 
- He actually did say that, Rudy. He said nobody-
- 
- Well I never that-
- 
- And then he said as far as I know-
- 
- If he said that he said it in, well as far as he knows that's true! 
- Rudy Giuliani is like a Choose Your Own Adventure! It just changes! (audience laughing) But the truth is it doesn't matter what Rudy Giuliani says, he's not the one being investigated yet! But what matters is, did the president say there was no collusion between the Russians and his campaign? 
- There was no collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian people. 
- Yeah, and at some point, Rudy's gonna have to deny that Trump is even the president. But the important thing, in Giuliani's mind is that Robert Mueller put this thing to rest. 
- He puts out the report, and then we get it and we see what it has-
- 
- Well let's-
- 
- I've always seen this-
- 
- Let's get it now-
- 
- I've always seen this as a false argument, the idea of he's now showing us what he has-
- 
- Well let's do it-
- 
- It's not over. 
- Well let's do it. 
- But he's gotta finish-
- 
- It's over enough! We've answered all those-
- 
- What does that mean-
- 
- Questions on collusion-
- 
- Over enough? 
- How much longer are you gonna let him do this-
- 
- He just put out that your campaign chairman was playing with the Russians! 
- But we don't, that isn't what, we don't need a special council to investigate a campaign chairman. 
- Oh boy, poor Rudy! Someday he's gonna be in a mental facility telling the nurses that he used to be the mayor or New York and they'll be like, uh-huh! (audience laughing) In the mean time, (audience applauding) while that's goin' on there, we have new details about Trump's former lawyer/friend Micheal Cohen. According to the Wall Street Journal, and according to Cohen himself in a lead up to Trump's run for president, Cohen hired a company to rig online polls in his favor. You know these polls that you go on and click which thing you want? But Cohen says, the president directed him to juice two polls, a CNBC poll of America's top business leaders, and a Drudge Report poll of Republican candidates for president. Even those didn't work out. Not only did he not win either of the polls, I think he didn't even crack the top 100 in the CNBC one. The guy Cohen hired to do this, according to The Journal showed up at Trump Tower, looking for $50,000 he was owed and when he did, the report says Cohen gave him a Walmart bag with 12 to $13,000 in cash and a boxing glove he claimed had been worn by a Brazilian MMA fighter as payment. It's like a scene out of the world's dumbest heist movie, it's Ocean's Chapter 11. And so, the goon Cohen hired is an IT guy, he's got a company, his name is John Gauger. There's not much about him online, but this audition tape he made trying to get on Survivor in 2005 kind of tells you all you need to know. 
- In my line of business I deal with people from around the globe on a daily basis. This has given the uncanny ability to make anybody like me. This will allow me to be the most loved Survivor contestant of all times, and maybe the most hated too. 
- Only the best people, you know? Literally everyone around Trump is a character from a reality show, and that is not even the best part of the story. So Cohen also asked the guy, while he was doin' this to set up a Twitter account called Women for Cohen. This is a real account, was created back in 2016, it's for quote, Women who love and support Michael Cohen. Strong, pit bull, sex symbol, no nonsense. Basically Cohen asked this guy, help me rig the election. Hey, while you're at it, could you make people think girls like me too? (audience laughing) Because I loved this I clicked to see who was following this account, and some of the women for Cohen are named John, Ted, Elvis, Theodore, Kevin and Sonny. We also have Steve, Douglas, Aaron, Casillas, Chris and Bill. And these are some of the things they tweeted. Put that up on the screen. Snazzy looking & ready to #MAGA. (audience laughing) Best looking men award goes to, heart and emoji, we love you guys! This has gotta be the saddest thing I ever heard of in my whole life. We're like a wee away from finding out Michael Cohen had a burner phone he used to send dirty texts to himself! (audience laughing) I may have underestimated Michael, 'cause he might be a lot more hilarious than I ever imagined! Hey by the way, I don't know if you heard about this but YouTube is, you familiar with YouTube? Yeah, okay, YouTube is cracking down on fun. YouTube announced that they're banning dangerous pranks and challenges from their platform. They posted this. Dangerous Challenges and Pranks Enforcement Update. Hi everybody, YouTube is home to many beloved viral challenges and pranks, like Jimmy Kimmel's Terrible Christmas Presents prank thank you, or the water bottle flip challenge. That said, we've always had policies to make sure what's funny doesn't cross the line into being harmful or dangerous. Our community guidelines prohibit content blah, blah, blah, dangerous activities all this kind of stuff. Basically YouTube has just banned YouTube videos. And (audience laughing) I have to say someone that loves a good prank and likes to do them, I think it's sad that a few bad apples had to ruin the fun of eating poisonous detergent packets for everyone but, (audience laughing) the bigger question is how do you know before you do something what qualifies as dangerous and what doesn't? I mean we've done some stuff that could potentially go in a dangerous direction. So anyway, YouTube happens to have an office right next door to us so we called over there and I went over to their office, to run some ideas by their content standards executive. Hi there-
- 
- Hi! 
- How are ya? 
- Good, how are you? 
- Thanks for having me. 
- Of course-
- 
- Appreciate it. So I was reading about these new rules that you guys have-
- 
- Yes. 
- With the YouTube challenges. And I'm a little bit concerned about it because we do a lot of that kind of stuff on the show. 
- Well I mean we trust what you do, that's a different situation-
- 
- Well that's great news. So I can do anything? 
- Well I wouldn't say anything, but I think-
- 
- Okay, well let me-
- 
- I think usually-
- 
- Let me run some things by you and you can just tell me, because there are things we're working on and I don't wanna get into it, and you know. Okay, the I bet you can't eat all the knives challenge. 
- (audience laughing) Well, no I would say not that one. 
- Really, that's a no? 
- Not that one. 
- The setting my brother on fire challenge. 
- (audience laughing) That sounds dangerous, no. 
- Dad, I boiled the toaster challenge.

- Definitely no. 
- Let's make friends on Craigslist challenge. (audience laughing) That one's okay? All right, can I borrow your pencil for a second? Thank you very much-
- 
- Well, we would need to, it couldn't just be-
- 
- Okay, there you go! Seat belts are for snowflakes challenge. 
- Uh, no! (audience laughing) 
- Drunk unicycle challenge. 
- No. 
- I believe I can actually fly challenge, is where somebody would go out on a building or out a window, whatever and R. Kelly style, but not that R. Kelly style, the other R. Kelly style. 
- No, on every level, no-
- 
- The boiling water bucket challenge, this would be for charity. Like the ice bucket challenge but hotter. 
- No. 
- Borrow cop's gun challenge? 
- Nope. 
- Grandma's been missing for eight weeks challenge. 
- No. 
- What if we wanna find her? We're helping to find her? 
- Hey, I feel like we're starting up-
- 
- What if she's in the trunk of a car? 
- That's a pretty dark place-
- 
- One more, I framed my mom for drug trafficking challenge. 
- (audience laughing) You know what, I'm gonna take this. 
- This is bull (bleep) 
- We like the other stuff! Oh, cap. (audience laughing)

- Indiana, Iowa, Las Vegas, Oklahoma, The Online Film Critics Society. (audience cheering) Every city you can imagine, the Satellite Awards, do you even know about some of these? 
- No! 
- No. 
- No, I mean I know about them when they happen but this whole award season thing, it's been quite, it's been an education, I have-
- 
- In what way has it been an education? 
- Because, well first of all I didn't realize there were so many different film critics circle association reviews and all of that. 
- Right. 
- Had no idea, kind of just thought, the film critics, they're the critics, they're the crew, they're all together-
- 
- They're one mass. 
- Yeah! 
- Yes. 
- But, I mean-
- 
- No. 
- So I'm like, the Rancho Cucamonga film critics, review is gonna happen. Every so often I get a call from my team and I'm just tickled and amazed because I don't know about some of them but I'm like, thank you! 
- I know at this point you probably have to give some of them away to neighbors or something right? 
- Nooooo! 
- Because you're-
- 
- They're mine! (audience laughing) My name-
- 
- You're gonna keep all of them-
- 
- And I'm gonna keep them all! 
- Even the Oklahoma Film Critics Circle? 
- Even, because that one is, Oklahoma? 
- That's the one, yeah! (laughs) 
- Never would've saw that one coming! 
- Are there enough film critics in Oklahoma, to form a circle? (audience applauding) 
- I'm sure there are about eight. 
- They're are probably-
- 
- Yeah, at least. 
- Well congratulations either way. 
- Thank you. 
- Do you run out of speeches? Do you run out of things to say? 
- I hope not, because I hope to be able to continue to do work that receives accolades, but I just say a prayer, and just make, please, just don't let me slub, or say something silly-
- 
- Do you plan it out beforehand, do you write something down before you go-
- 
- I don't, I feel like that's jinxin' the whole thing. 
- Interesting, I think that's true, yes. 
- Yeah, because-
- 
- 'Cause there's nothin' more embarrassing then gettin' home that night-
- 
- And look at that paper, and you're go like, yeah-
- 
- And you go like, oh. 
- Yeah, it's preparing for failure. 
- Yeah, and the only thing about that is there's always someone that you forget. 
- Yes, right, you have to remember everyone's name or else-
- 
- Or you get names wrong. 
- Oh, have you done that? 
- I did. 
- Do you think you need to thank anyone who's name you don't know how to pronounce? 
- I say call them by their first name. 
- I say that-
- 
- Just 'cause usually the last names are the doozies. But I say just the first name. 
- That's very, but most people don't have this problem. 
- They call them champaign problems, right? 
- Yeah, that's right. 
- Okay. 
- By the way happy birthday, I know it was your birthday on Tuesday, I saw-
- 
- Thank you! 
- Did they give you awards for that too, or did you get gifts, or what did you do for your birthday-
- 
- I did, I did! I got a lotta liquor! 
- You did? Yeah, I don't know what that says about me, but-
- 
- People give you bottles? 
- Yes. 
- Yeah, interesting. 
- Nice bottles. 
- And then when they give to you do you open it up right away, and enjoy? 
- No, I take my time-
- 
- You take your time. 
- I like to open them up with people. 
- Did you have a party or anything? 
- I did not have a party, I had a party of one at the spa, for about four hours. It was so sweet because my masseuse, she was walking me and she goes, I know I'm not supposed to say this, but I'm just so happy for you! 
- Oh really? 
- And it was just so, the amount of love that I'm getting from people-
- 
- Well you thank your masseuse at the Oscars! Do you remember her first name? 
- No! (Jimmy laughs) 
- I wanna thank Miranda for the deep tissue. 
- Yes, yes! (audience laughing) You really got up in those shoulders! 
- You might run out of people to thank with all these awards, it's crazy! 
- I don't think I'll run out of people to thank-
- 
- Who were you excited to meet at the Golden Globes? Is there anyone you had not met or are these the same people every single time? 
- Okay, here's the thing. This whole award season thing, you're seeing a lot of the same people and then you also see people that you're a huge fan of, and I normally don't up to people and ask to take pictures, just because I feel like if they're not very nice people then they've just destroyed what's in my head-
- 
- They'll ruin it for you-
- 
- So, I decided to go against everything that I know when I saw Sam Elliott. 
- Sam Elliott, yeah! Oh, you love Sam Elliott! 
- Can you tell? 
- Yeah, Sam Elliott's a real sex symbol, kind of an under the radar sex symbol. 
- Oh my God, I love that man! 
- Did you tell him that? 
- I did! 
- Was he delighted? 
- I did, he was just so charming and so wonderful, and even better than I had hoped that he would be in the moment, and the mustache is real! 
- Oh yeah! 
- It's just like, it's perfect! And I just said, I love Roadhouse! 
- That's the one huh?

- 
- There are many-
- 
- Ways you could go with that. 
- There's a lot of ways to go. I do and it's so interesting, because there's a whole story and I hope I can get it all in. I wanted like an Afro-
- 
- That's what I would have too. 
- And Barry's like, Yeah, no. 
- Oh, really? 
- Yeah, yeah! 
- Why no? 
- And was like, but you know I'm no longer doing anything like pressing my hair out. I've got an Afro Barry, that the world wants to see. But he was like, I appreciate that, but no. 
- No Afro-
- 
- And so, he really started sending pictures of women that he felt visually, Sharon is the role that I play, would be, and I got it. It made sense, and him sharing that just turned into, it made me understand the character-
- 
- It started with the hair, and then-
-

- Yeah, that's something else. 
- Worked our way on down.

- Yes-
-

- Well-
- 
- Yeah! 
- Yes. 
- What can you tell us about what you're up to on that show? Anything? Can you tell us which character you play? 
- I can tell you, that I'm a woman. 
- Okay? 
- And that I am maybe somewhat of a badass? 
- Okay. 
- And I may have some scenes with some really awesome actors. 
- That's it huh? Can you tell us anything about the story and in what era it will take place? Sorry, this is real nerd stuff and I need to get to the bottom of it. 
- No, 'cause the fans are real. If I just say the wrong bit of anything-
- 
- That's what I'm hoping-
- 
- They will crack-
- 
- You're gonna do-
- 
- The code and yeah-

- How're you doin'? Everything all right? 
- I'm good man. 
- Family is good? 
- Aah, the family is so good! 
- I know you live here in L.A. Did you bring the whole family to New York when you were shooting The Punisher? 
- No I bring, I guess I bring my dog family. I don't bring, the humans stay home. 
- I see-
- 
- Yeah, the dogs-
- 
- The humans stay home-
- 
- The babies stay home man, but the dogs definitely come. We hightail it across the country. We can't put 'em on planes so we drive. 
- Oh you do? 
- We do-
- 
- Is that fun? 
- You know, it's a mixed bag. I drive with my old man-
- 
- Oh, really? 
- I do, I do, which is, look. My old man is the greatest dad on earth. I love my dad with all my heart. And what, right on! And you know, for a 70-year old guy to just pick up and drive cross-country with three pit-bulls, that's somethin' man. But I'll tell you there are specific rules and regulations for driving cross-country with my old man. 
- Oh he has rules! 
- Oh, yeah! Well first of all you're not gonna do any driving, which is great, right? 
- He drives the whole time-
- 
- He drives the whole time. You ain't touchin' the wheel right? Which is cool, because it's like havin' a personal driver, right? But I'm gonna tell you right now. Jimmy, if you even think about turning on that radio, I know it doesn't matter whether it's music, it doesn't matter whether it's news, you will get smacked, with this man hand! My old man's got those thick, hairy, just one, you touch that dial, bam! You know what I mean? And that's just a day ruiner right there. 
- Well why doesn't he-
- 
- He's just, he's got-
- 
- He wants silence in the car? 
- He's just very specific. Look, when you stop for gas, that is your time to go to the bathroom, it's time for the dogs to go to the bathroom, that's where you're gettin' your food and your coffee. If you think about, like a Starbucks, not gonna happen. All of a sudden, you're Hollywood man! Like oh, mister self-serve Hollywood needs a Starbucks! (Jimmy laughs) You just get ripped apart, and it's not like I'm gettin' a Caramel Macchiato man, I want a black coffee, and he's just like, he's not happening-
- 
- Are you allowed to talk to to him in the car? 
- Yes, you are I guess, and that's the thing. Like I always think we're gonna have these deep kind of father-son bonding moments, and we start to sometime, the thing is that he is constantly screaming at every one else on the road. Like he's in a huge rut, and we say things I definitely can't say here, but like he's just driving with hatred! The entire way across the country, and it's like-
- It just kinda interrupts the moment! 
- Yeah sure, yeah! Does your dad think he's a good road trip partner? 
- I think he would probably consider himself the best in the business. (Jimmy laughing) I think like, and look the truth is look, he drives fast as hell, he knows how to go-
- 
- How many days from L.A. to New York? 
- He goes straight man, that man does not stop. 
- Really-
- 
- You do not stop that man-
- 
- So you do it in like two and a half days? 
- My man, my man, that's it. 
- Wow, wow, maybe you should get him a job with Uber or something, you know? 
- Oh boy, oh boy-
- 
- It seems like he would be the ideal driver-
- 
- Yeah, just don't touch the radio. 
- So, The Punisher is a rare, for those who don't follow, I know all this stuff and it's all worthless information, but the rare Marvel character who doesn't really have powers necessarily, do you feel cheated in any way about that? 
- Look, I love Frank Castle. He's a character that has resonated deeply with the military community and the law enforcement community, and it's been an honor to play him. I wouldn't have it any other way. 
- Do you love those days that you get to beat people up on set? Is that fun? 
- You know man, two things that I've sworn to myself that I will never do-
- 
- What are they? 
- Come on a show like this, and talk about, not, I'm here, but talk about-
- 
- Not that part-
- 
- No, not that part! 
- Come on a show like this, that one-
- 
- Come on a show like this and talk about how I do my own stunts, or how I get injured doing stunts. But, I'm gonna do both of those things-
- 
- Okay yeah, go ahead-
- 
- Here's the thing. I like to do all my own stunts, I like to do the fighting myself, I think it's important for the audience to see Frank Castle in those moments, and I did, I broke my hand pretty bad in the first fight scene of the season this year-
- 
- Oh, great. 
- Yeah, and I knew exactly when it happened, it was a three-day fight scene, and it was the first day, and I hit somebody and I knew, I'm a boxer, I knew immediately it was broken. But me being the orangutan I am I didn't say anything to anyone 'cause I didn't wanna get pulled. I wanted to stay in the fight. And so the very next thing I had to do with a broken hand was, my name Jordan Scott, a stunt performer, he had to take my hand, and I had a knife and he had to bash my broken hand into a table, and I'm The Punisher man, it can't just be two hits, he's gotta like bash the hell out of my hand on the table. And so I go to the stunt coordinator, Eric Linden. I said, hey man is there anyway we can switch it to the left hand? He goes, What're you doin' man? Stay on script, no the camera's over there, like do it, man up! All right, ma-bam, ma-bam, ma-bam! Now I got torn ligaments in my hand right? So the next thing I gotta do is I gotta kick this guy's leg out and he falls down and I gotta catch him right in my poor hand, and I say to him again, hey man, is there just any chance we could just move this to the left hand? And a perfect opportunity to just say, hey man, my hand's injured-
- 
- Right-
- 
- I didn't say it, and so I said all right, this is gonna suck, here we go! And like my hand, and then now I've dislocated my hand! And the very last thing that we had to do in the scene, on day three, is these guys are shooting at me with automatic weapons and I throw a bar stool at them. I don't know, I didn't write it but that what we got right? And so I go, I gotta-
- 
- Sit on this now! 
- I go to grab this bar stool, and I just freeze, 'cause I know with this mangled mess of a hand I'm not gonna be able to throw the stool. Stunt coordinator comes over again, Come on man, man up and throw the damn stool, what is the matter with you? Oh God, all right, here we go-
- 
- You're not being treated well on the set-
- 
- No, no, no, he's the best, I should've said something. And the thing is, the directors and the producers, they're all watching the scene in Video Village looking this way, and they don't see when I grab it with my left hand I'm supposed to throw that thing at a mat, but instead I just chucked that thing and all of a sudden you hear this (exclaiming loudly) and it hit that stunt coordinator right in the leg! (audience laughing) And that's somethink you go to the hospital with! Again! 
- He's gotta man up! Went to the hospital! One non Punisher related question for you-
- 
- What do you got-
- 
- I read on Monday, and this is very exciting. David Chase is going to do a movie, a prequel to The Sopranos, and I read that you are going to be in it. Will you be in this film? (audience laughing) You do know what I'm talking about? You've seen the article? You're nodding yes, does that mean yes, I am gonna be in this film? It does mean yes right there! Well if you break anything on that set, please tell David Chase, or something like that. 
- I give you my word. 
- I think your father, made you silent about things that you shouldn't be.
