- Well thanks so much to you for joining us today, I'm Jim Sciutto. You can follow me on Twitter @JimSciutto. At This Hour With Kate Bolduan starts right now. 
- Hello everyone, I'm Kate Boldaun. Thanks so much for joining me. A ticking time bomb, that is what federal investigators warn in a new report about the dangerous overcrowding occurring in government border facilities. A government report, not an advocacy group, not Democratic members of Congress, not attorneys representing migrants, this is a 16 page report compiled by the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security. Look at these images that we're showing right here. What they found is shocking. Mass overcrowding of children and adults, some with no access to showers or clean clothes. No laundry facilities. It's all detailed in the report. Some children with no access to warm meals for days. Adults forced into standing room only conditions for a week, the report says. Officials describe the migrants even as banging on cell windows and holding up signs for help. And then there are these images. These are images drawn by children who recently were released from border facilities. The drawings appear to show children, you know exactly what your eyes tell you. In cages, in jail. The American Academy of Pediatrics released these pictures, saying that these facilities, in their words, are no place for children. It's a painful reminder of what these children are going through and are going through right now. Let's get straight over to CNN's Nick Valencia. He's at a border facility in El Paso, Texas. Nick, what's the very latest? 
- Well, it's a bit of breaking news this morning. We're hearing from acting DHS secretary, Kevin McAleenan about those social media posts. Remember earlier this week Kate we reported, ProPublica, the investigative team first reported about this closed Facebook group that featured current and former they say, Border Patrol agents making lewd comments, derogatory comments, racially inflammatory comments, joking about dead migrants. Well, now Kevin McAleenan the acting DHS secretary tweeting this this morning. I have directed an immediate investigation, and as the U.S. Border Patrol Cheif has made clear, any employee found to have compromised the public's trust in our law enforcement mission will be held accountable. What is a little bit unclear to us at this moment is we were under the understanding that earlier this week an investigation had already been under way. The posts were said to have been turned over to the Internal Affairs at CBP, DHS. Inspector General has also said to have gotten their hands on these social media posts. A broader question though Kate, we're also wondering if he's calling for an investigation into these social media posts? When will he call for an investigation into the conditions in these Border Patrol facilities? And speaking on that, it was yesterday that I spoke to a long time veteran El Paso Border Patrol agent who said that they are just tired of seeing the conditions that migrants are being held in and decided to speak out. So long as we concealed their identity. You're taking a big risk by doing this. 
- [Agent] Yes, but America needs to know. They need to know the truth. 
- [Nick] A Border Patrol agent who's had enough. In a CNN exclusive interview, the veteran agent who agreed to go on camera only if their identity was concealed, expressed disgust at a closed Facebook group reportedly comprised of thousands of current and former agents. ProPublica the first to expose the group, I'm 10-15, where members shared lewd and sexist content about Latina members of congress including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The agent telling CNN being derogatory is part of the Border Patrol culture, even hearing a supervisor joke about dead migrants. 
- [Agent] He was making fun of them. 
- Saying what? 
- [Agent] That, what difference does it make, it's just another life. He made a comment also regarding running over illegals and I'm like, you cannot run over people. 
- [Nick] In describing the conditions inside the El Paso detention facilities, the agent compared them to a zoo. 
- [Agent] The holding facility, the cells, they are, what I would say, filthy. We have a maintenance and cleaning crew that clean the general area, like the hallways, but I have never seen them cleaning pampers, or cleaning toilets in the cells or cleaning sinks in the cell. Sometimes you go in a cell and there is trash everywhere. 
- There are those in leadership in Customs and Border Protection, 
- [Agent] Yes. 
- [Nick] They say, that migrants are getting basic human rights. What do you say to leaders who are saying, migrants are getting basic human rights? 
- [Agent] What is basic human rights? Toilet paper? Water from the sink? Wearing the same clothing for days? I remember when there used to be a processing center, where we used to have, especially in winter, we used to have these blankets, and 10 different aliens would use the same blanket. We would recycle them. We'd put them in a bag and they wouldn't get wash. 
- I feel like, you know, multiple times during our interview you've sort of stared off in the distance and you've thought about some things that you've seen. It seems as though there are things that you might take home with you. 
- [Agent] Everyday. 
- Like what? 
- [Agent] The kids. 
- [Nick] What about the kids? 
- [Agent] You know, they just want hope. They want to believe in something. They want to feel sure. 
- Do you support President Trump's immigration policies? 
- [Agent] President Trump is our Commander-in-chief, and unless he's unethical, illegal, or immoral we should obey. 
- [Nick] The question is, at what cost? Customs and Border Protection did not directly respond to those allegations, Kate, but they did say that they're handing them over to the Office of the Inspector General. 
- Nick, thanks so much. Really great reporting down there, really appreciate it. Joining me right now, to discuss this further, is Congressman Marc Veasey of Texas. He was among the Democratic lawmakers who visited some of the border detention facilities in his state this week. Congressman, I was just seeing you shaking your head. 
- Yeah, I mean, just hearing that, I mean, how can you hear that and it not just break your heart? I mean, it's awful. And based on what I saw, on my trip, day before yesterday, I 100% believe him. They did everything they could to give us the there's nothing here to see tour, but when you talked to migrants that were in custody, they told us first hand that they were being told to drink out of toilets when they were thirsty, that there were kids that were walking around in clothing where there was mucus just from days and days worth of mucus and other debris on their clothing. Showers being denied for days. They told us that they could shower anytime, at least once a day, but what we were told was that they were being denied showers for days by migrants, and you know, based on this Facebook post, how can you not believe that the migrants were telling us the truth, and now based on what this Border Patrol agent was just telling us and the IG report, I mean, something has to change. 
- Well, let's talk about that, but before we get there, on top of those two things, there's something else that has come out, these images, these drawings from the American Academy of Pediatrics. They released these pictures of drawings that young children made once they were released, but made of their time in custody. I mean, you can see with your own eyes, what it clearly looked like to them and more importantly, what it felt like to them to be in there. What do you say to that when you see this? 
- Yeah, well, I can't see the images, but I can tell you that we saw young children that appeared to me to be three or four years old that were in holding cells. Holding cells similar to what you would see at a county lock-up. And again, just based on the IG's report and the interviews that we just heard, there's no question in my mind that these children are being treated very poorly and I think that it also illustrates that President Trump will do anything that he can to try to appease his base when it comes to immigration and that he is using this migrants, as pawns in a political game and that is just absolutely sick and it has to stop now. And I will tell you that one of the things that has to change today is that members of Congress need to be able to go and visit these facilities without 48 hour notice. Right now, we have to give 48 hour notice. We need to be able to go into these facilities whenever we want to and we can fly down there on our own dime, we can fly down there at the spur of the moment-
- 
- I actually have been wondering about this, Congressman. 
- When we hear about this allegations. 
- It's really interesting actually that you bring this up because I've been wondering this. Coming from the IG report, where they did surprise visits at five facilities and that's what they found. And even with the amount of notice that you were given, that you had to give to go into this facility, and the stories that you were told, I'm starting to wonder if you just, because journalists can't go in there with cameras, that's the thing I continue to have to say to our viewers. Why don't you just make a tour of it, why don't you just give that 48 hours notice and make a tour of it and keep visiting these facilities over and over again because maybe that is what would bring about, maybe that is what would bring about change? 
- Yeah, I think that again, obviously more tours would be helpful, but not having to give the notice. I mean, if I wanted to go down there right now and visit that facility at Clint, or any of them along the border, I need to be able to, as a member of Congress, we have oversight of these committees, and the game that they're playing. And I personally feel like the reason why they're playing games is that they feel empowered by this president and Stephen Miller, who's his so-called immigration tzar. 
- But you do have someone appointed by the President as well, the new Acting Chief of the Department of Homeland Security, who he says he's acting, in talking about the Facebook postings, that secret Facebook page. He's directed an investigation and he says that anyone who's done wrong should be and will be held accountable. We learned that today. Do you applaud him? 
- Yeah, no absolutely. He is certainly saying the right thing when it comes to that. We need to see it followed up with action. Of course, you probably saw that Elijah Cummings, who's the Chair of the Oversight Committee, that he's going to conduct investigations, that the acting secretary said that he is going to conduct investigations. And not only do people need to be disciplined, people need to be fired. I mean, I can't tell you, Kate, just the fact, knowing that some of the people that were supposed to be our security for that day, when we were at the press conference, and all of the people that were wearing the MAGA hats were screaming obscenities at us, that those were supposed to be our security personnel and those are the people that are supposed to be in charge of making sure these migrants are being treated humanely, and they're a part of that Facebook page. That's just absolutely unacceptable. So, when investigations are conducted, and I hope that they will be conducted very swiftly, people need to be terminated and, again, depending on what is found out, there may need to be some people that need to be prosecuted. 
- Well, one thing that we do know, is there's something like 9500 members of that Facebook page, but we don't know exactly who those Facebook pages, who those postings are from, who those people are in real life, that is part of the investigation and that is what Kevin McAleenan says they're gonna get to the bottom of. There's so much more to this, especially from this IG report. I just cannot turn away from it and no one else should. Congressman, thank you comin' on. Let us know when you go on your next tour. 
- Absolutely. 
- We have another story, though, that we're following this morning. CNN has learned that military chiefs have concerns over what President Trump's Fourth of July event is turning into. A source with direct knowledge says that while planning the event, Pentagon leaders expressed reservations about putting military hardware, like tanks and other armored vehicles, on display. Those concerns, I mean, they don't appear to have had much of an impact as we know, tanks are already on the National Mall as of this morning. So, what's this all going to cost? That is also unclear. CNN's Tom Foreman, he's in Washington, at the National Mall for us. 
- Hey Kate, preparations are underway all up and down the National Mall here where things like this big pieces of military hardware are being brought in as the President has requested to have a great show of American power and influence. But his critics are saying what this really is all about is a great show of his ego. The iconic fireworks over the National Mall will be moved to a new spot. All flights will be grounded at Washington's Reagan National Airport for more than two hours and three times the usual number of National Guard troops will be deployed for security. All so President Donald Trump can be the centerpiece for DC's Fourth of July celebration, giving an unprecedented speech at the Lincoln Memorial. 
- We're gonna have a great Fourth of July in Washington DC. It'll be like no other. 
- [Tom] For all the costly changes, it's still not precisely what he wanted early on, a grand military parade, as seen in other some countries, such as France, Russia, and North Korea, but cost estimates for that plan quickly ran into tens of millions of dollars. The DC City Council, mindful of expensive street damage howled, No tanks. The Park Service has remained quiet about how much it will cost to take on the additional requirements. And the Pentagon is not discussing the price tag for a flyover by the Blue Angels, a plane that serves as Air Force One, some other aircraft, and a couple of tanks and troop carriers that will also be there, but simply parked near the Mall. 
- We wanna bring millions of people into the city and we want people to come who love our country! Those are the people we want. 
- [Tom] The President tweeting, The Pentagon and our great Military Leaders are thrilled, after asking the chiefs of every branch to stand with him during the celebration. The Pentagon, not saying which, if any, are going. And adding to the frustration of those who claim the traditionally non-partisan event is being hijacked by Team Trump, the White House, and the Republican National Committee, are reportedly giving VIP access to favored friends and colleagues. Democrats say on this scorching week, they are largely being frozen out. The White House response. 
- This is a public event, it's open to the public. 
- One part of the public I don't think they're going to like too much, Kate, is protestors have received a permit to fly that baby Trump balloon over everything. So that will also be up in the air here, no doubt to the displeasure of the White House. Kate. 
- Tom, thank you so much. So, it is of course the Fourth of July as we're discussing, and we are of course in the middle of an election season so you know what that means. All roads lead to Iowa! At least for almost everyone. Most of the top Democratic presidential contenders converging on the state right now, what does that look like on the ground? And what are Iowa caucus goers, what are they talkin' about right now? 
- My experience with USAA has been excellent. They really appreciate military families and it really shows. 
- With all that USAA offers, why go with anybody else? We know their rates are good. We know that they're always gonna take care of us. 
- It was instant savings and I should have changed a long time ago. 
- It was funny because when we would call, another insurance company they would say, Oh we can't beat USAA.

- If you're running for president, there are some general rules of the road, and this is in no way a complete list. You need get used to shakin' hands, lots of 'em, you need to get used to kissing really cute babies, and you better get yourself to Iowa if it is the Fourth of July. Seven candidates are campaigning across the state today, including four of the five top tier in the latest polling out of Iowa. All crisscrossing the state to make their pitch, capitalize on their debate bounce, or make up ground for their recent drop-off if you will. So, let's go there. Joining me right now is Chief Politics Reporter for the Des Moines Register, Brianne Pfannenstiel Brianne, thanks for being here. 
- Thanks for having me. 
- So the latest polling numbers we have out of Iowa really show that the race has reset. We've got Kamala Harris seeing a big bounce, launching into second place, Biden in the front still but seeing a real slide in support. What are you hearing on the ground. Is Kamala's rise for real? 
- Well I think you're hearing a lot of voters who are really interested in Kamala. You know, even in Iowa a lot of people are really tuning into this whole process for the first time during the national debates. They're seeing this candidates lined up side by side, and so they're getting their first sense of how they interact, how they appeal to voters, and so people are really interested in Kamala right now, they're interested to see what she's gonna be talking about during her campaign swing here. She's got several events across the state so we'll be following her but Joe Biden is also in town and so people also are curious to see how he's going to respond to this new pressure. 
- That's a great question. The candidate who seems to be also facing some real trouble in Iowa right now is Bernie Sanders. In a pre-debate, Sanders was holding out, holding on in second place at 16% support. Post-debate the USA Today Suffolk University poll out of Iowa, he dropped to fourth place, and for the first time hitting into the single digits there. You were just at a Sanders event. What about his message isn't connecting with folks there? What are you hearing? 
- Well, I think there's a little bit of a disconnect because the people who like Bernie Sanders really like Bernie Sanders. You go to some events and the people who are there are very much for him. They're committed to him in a way that they're not committed to a lot of these other candidates on the ground here. You go to these events and people say, you know I'm shopping around, I wanna hear from more people, I'm trying to see what they have to say but you go to a Bernie Sanders event and they say, I'm here for Bernie I'm planning to caucus for him. So while he certainly slipped in the polls I wouldn't necessarily underestimate how much support he has here in Iowa from his core base. These polls are showing him slipping and so he may need to adjust his message a little bit but I also think we're gonna be seeing a lot of movement between now and caucus day in those polls. 
- And also one thing we know about Bernie Sanders is adjusting his message is not something that he does. He's had the same message for a long time and that's what his supporters love about him. So watching the debate of course there were a million issues in the two hour or four hours over the two nights that the candidates cared about, talked about and were asked about. Is there one or two issues that you are hearing most about from Democrats in Iowa as they're facing this big field of Democrats right now to choose from? 
- Yeah, and we try to track this a lot. You know, what questions are Iowans asking at these events? What's top of mind for them and we try to do a lot of polling of the crowds just one on one as reporters and so what we hear every single time is healthcare is a huge issue and so where they fall on healthcare, where they want these candidates to stand on say Medicare for all is vast. There's a lot of differences in what they want but healthcare is, I would say, the top issue that we're hearing about and I think that's followed really closely by climate change right now. 
- Oh, that's really interesting to see, to hear that from Democrats and can be really telling on maybe what the messaging will be that we hear from all the Democrats that are there right now. Trump won Iowa in the general in 2016, before that Obama won twice in Iowa. The president was back recently holding rallies in Iowa. How is his level of support in Iowa right now? What are you hearing about President Trump? 
- Well, among Republicans his support has stayed very strong in Iowa. You know, all of our polling from the time he was elected to where he's at right now he gets in the 80s, 80% support among Republicans who really approve of the job he's doing. So to the degree that Iowa Republicans supported him in 2016 we haven't seen that wavering. I think there are some republicans who are skeptical, certainly some independents who are shopping around but among his core base we've really seen those numbers steady. 
- Brianne, much more to come. Thank you so much. Good luck tracking all these candidates for the next couple days, thank you. Programming note for all of you. A CNN exclusive. Former Vice President Joe Biden and his wife Dr. Jill Biden will be sitting down with Chris Cuomo. That interview airs Friday morning at six and 8:00 a.m. Eastern only on CNN. Still to come for us the Supreme Court blocked a question about citizenship from the U.S. Census. We've talked a lot about that since that decision happened. The administration then conceded defeat and said that it was going ahead and printing the Census forms without having the question or without fighting it anymore, but President Trump just now says that the fight isn't over. What is going on here? We'll be back. 
- [Announcer] This is Rick Blonquest. His life is pretty comfortable. Then he laid on a Serta and realized his life was only just sort of comfortable. 
- I've been living a lie. 
- [Announcer] The Serta iComfort Hybrid Mattress. Not just sort of comfortable, Serta comfortable.

So now I use Heavy Duty Swiffer Sweeper and Dusters. For hard to reach places Duster makes it easy to clean. It captures dust in one swipe. Ha, gotcha!

Stop cleaning, start Swiffering.

- President Trump is refusing to accept defeat. Denying that his administration is backing down just a day after it announced a huge about face that it is going to be moving forward with printing the Census without including the citizenship question that Trump officials had fought so hard to include. Moments ago President Trump spoke out denying the position of his own administration. Tweeting this in part. We are absolutely moving forward as we must because of the importance of this answer to this question. Aside from the fac that that seems a little bit confusing this is like the second tweet that he had about this today and he is saying that they're gonna fight on. So, he's not giving up now? But what can he do? The forms are being printed according to the Commerce Department, and the Supreme Court told the administration that they had to go back to the drawing board if they even wanted to consider this question again. Joining me right now to hopefully get some answers here CNN Supreme Court reporter, Ariane de Vogue. Ariane, what can the president do at this point? 
- Well, those tweets certainly seem to leave open the possibility but he might be having to pull a rabbit out of a hat here, Kate because yesterday Secretary Ross's statement was definitive and the Department of Justice told the court that the decision was final according to plaintiff's lawyers and one of the reasons is, is they have big hurdles here. They have a Census official who testified that waiting until October to print those questionnaires could jeopardize the administration of the Census and he also said that it would take a lot of resources to do so, and on top of that there's two collateral legal proceedings happening in the lower courts. In New York one judge is considering sanctions against the government for new evidence that had been recently disclosed that suggested that the decision might have been politically motivated. And another judge in Maryland he was considering at least reopening the case, more deposition, more testimony. A government official told me today that the decision was final, that they just looked at these deadlines and the possibility of more injunctions and they thought it wasn't realistic. But maybe what the president is talking about is what the Census officials have argued all along. Keep in mind Census officials had said, there's other ways to get this information. It doesn't have to be on the question. For instance they can get it through other data with the government, and there's a survey that goes out to some households and asks the questions. So maybe that's what the president is talking about but it's a little unclear right now, Kate. 
- A little unclear? It's a lot unclear if you will, Ariane and I think this goes into the category of I don't know if it's dream world versus reality but in the very least because the Commerce Secretary says the Census papers are being printed without the question it's at least maybe don't listen to what the president says just look at what he actually does and let's see if he actually tries to fight this change just to do anything about it or he just wants to tweet about it. Thanks, Ariane. 
- Thanks, Kate.

- South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg is rolling out a plan today to promote the call to service. A plan that would greatly expand voluntary public service programs in the country with a goal, according to the campaign, of attracting a quarter of a million Americans to serve in the near term and potentially more down the road. We're talking about programs like AmeriCorps and the Peace Corps. But while he's promoting the call to service the mayor is also dealing with continued questions about his leadership back home. Racial tension flaring up in South Bend last month after a white police officer shot and killed a black man who approached the officer with a knife raised, that's according to the police. The case has fueled anger from the community and activists and police. Just yesterday the Fraternal Order of Police in South Bend called for Buttigieg to remove himself from any involvement in that investigation. Buttigieg addressed the controversy again yesterday. 
- Events compel me to acknowledge that whatever we've done has not been nearly enough. As long as a traffic stop is a completely different experience for a black driver than it is for a white driver we know we have not done nearly enough. We know that as long as police departments, and this is true of my own, do not reflect the community they serve in their makeup then we have not done enough. I accept responsibility for the work that is left to be done. 
- Joining me right now is the president of the South Bend Fraternal Order of Police. Police Sergeant Harvey Mills. Sergeant, thank you for being here. 
- Thank you, Kate. 
- In your statement yesterday in calling for the mayor to pull himself off of the investigation you said that the mayor is quote, More concerned about boosting his own presidential political campaign than insuring a fair investigation. why do you think that? 
- Ma'am, several of the comments he's made, he's already called for the, or he's already stated that this officer will be held accountable, well the investigation's not even complete. This officer was justified in defending himself against a man with an eight inch hunting knife. It's just absurd that he would make statements like that as well as calling all officers racist. 
- I wanted to get to that because I heard you say that. I've heard you say that you think that the mayor has called all officers racist and I looked back at what he said during the debate and I also looked at what he said on Monday and he was talking about systemic racism and here's how he explained it on Monday. He said that, Every mayor works in the shadows of systemic racism. Every resident lives in the shadow of systemic racism, people of color and people who are not. So this is not an attack on our police department is specifically what the mayor said. He says he's not calling out the South Bend Police. He says he's calling, he's saying that every city in America, every mayor in America has to deal with the issue of systemic racism that does exist. I mean, surely you would agree that every city, mayor, police department in America should stand up to that. 
- No ma'am I really don't believe that's the issue. The issue is not race at all especially with this incident color has absolutely nothing to do with. Systemic is including everyone and-
- 
- Systemic means common though. And systemic racism is an issue in the country. 
- Well, the definition actually of systemic actually says the system, so that's what he's called for and many of the comments he's made, even the ones he just made on Monday were backpedaling from what he had mentioned before. 
- Let me play for you, the mayor was asked to respond to your criticism yesterday and to recuse himself from the investigation. Let me play for you his response. 
- Well, first of all I don't make disciplinary decisions so I would expect them to understand that this is a matter for our Board of Safety which is a board of civilians that I appoint to take up and I've been careful not to weigh in on the incident while the investigation is going on. But one of the things I really need to continue conveying to our police officers is that it is not anti-police to be pro-racial justice. On the contrary we absolutely can and absolutely must be both. 
- They mayor says the investigation's being handled by the Board of Safety. What would removing himself from the investigation actually do? 
- If he continues to talk about it, especially on a presidential campaign it influences all of those members on the Board of Safety and those are handpicked by him, members of the Board of Safety so they would be greatly influenced by any of his words so he should not mention this investigation at all on his presidential campaign. 
- Have you reached out to the mayor to discuss this? 
- Mayor Buttigieg has called me, we have not had a dialogue but we are willing to have a dialogue. It is needed. He had ignored previous requests before the shooting to speak with the FOP on other issues. 
- Well, I look forward to hearing what comes of that conversation, Sergeant. We'll check back in with you. Thank you for being here. 
- Thank you.

- This Sunday the all new CNN original series, The Movies takes you inside some of the iconic American films through the decades. The movies that have stirred our imagination, influenced our culture, shaped our lives. One of my favorites the 1980s hit, The Princess Bride. 
- He didn't fall! Inconceivable! 
- You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means. 
- The Princess Bride is a blend between romance, satire, adventure, swashbuckling. I mean it's all mixed in and it's a very strange mixture hard to capture. 
- Westley, what about the ROUS's? 
- Rodents of unusual size? I don't think they exist. 
- You have to walk a balance, you know? It's a fine line between stupid and clever. 
- Beat it or I'll call the brut squad. 
- I'm on the brute squad. 
- You are the brute squad. 
- Joining me right now is actor, author, screenwriter of course the man who played the part of Westley in the iconic movie, The Princess Bride Cary Elwes. Cary thank you so much for being here. 
- It's my joy, Kate. Thank you for having me. 
- I can't even tell you how much fun, how excited I was when I found out I was able to finally speak with the one and only Westley of, The Princess Bride. It really shows how iconic this movie is. 
- Thank you so much, I know I'm very blessed. I call it the gift that keeps on giving. 
- It sure does. So, in taking the role, the meaning, the legend, the legacy of, The Princess Bride in the context of this CNN look into the movies in this episode that we're looking at I wanna read you how director Rob Reiner describes, The Princess Bride. He describes it as A blend between romance, satire, adventure, swashbuckling. And he says, I mean it's all mixed into a strange mixture that's hard to capture. It got me thinking when this first came out in 1987 the studio didn't even know how to market it. Is it because it was such a strange mixture that made it such a classic do you think? 
- I think that's part of it, Kate. It was a hard film for them to market because they couldn't figure out which genre they should focus on. Was it a romance film, was it an adventure, was it a fantasy, was it a comedy? And they'd never seen a film like that before. In fact I don't think anyone had so I mean Rob describes it perfectly when he says that he wanted us to just make sure that we didn't play the lines for laughs. 
- When did you first know that the film had found its audience? That it was so much, it was so, it had such following. 
- Well, you know it's interesting Kate. It didn't have a big following when it came out. It came out the same time as, Fatal Attraction which just cleared out every other movie that was competing with it. 
- Slightly different from, Fatal Attraction. 
- Slightly different genre but again the poster that Fox came up with was very unusual. It didn't really sell the movie very well and it was a very beautiful poster but nobody knew what the film was. Was it a kids movie, was it a girls movie with the title and it's only through word of mouth it was really the college campuses that students that really picked up on the film. And it wasn't until 10 years later when the film came out on VHS that it had this, it literally went from being mostly dead to having a whole new life and I'll never forget, I was in New York and I was ordering a hamburger or something in a restaurant and the waitress said, How do you want that cooked? And I said, Medium rare and she goes, As you wish. And that was the first time I'd heard it being said by anyone. And my life changed after that. I forever people asking me on the street to say that line. 
- You wrote about the experience. You wrote a memoir in 2014 about the making of the film. Was it as much fun to make as it was to watch. 
- Well that's why I wrote the book, Kate. 'Cause fans always come up to me and say, Was it as much fun making it as it looks? And I said it was more fun. And I realized that that wasn't sufficient to make them feel satisfied and so I thought well I should write a book about it and share it with everyone just how much fun it really was and I think you can see it translates onto the screen. I can't remember a single day without laughter. 
- That's so good to hear as someone who's such a fan of the film. There are so many one liners. I was just kind of banting them about with my producer before we came to you. Other than, As you wish what are some of the other ones that always stick in your head? What would you say your favorites are? 
- Oh my gosh, I love, Anybody want a peanut? which is just silly. Never get involved in a land war in Asia is pretty great. 
- Do not forget, My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father, prepare to die. 
- I mean, you know Paul Mandy says he gets asked that literally every five minutes. It's incredible. Wally Shawn said he can't walk down the street in New York without somebody saying, Inconceivable to him. If he drops his keys or misses a cab or is late for an airplane, you know somebody says it to him. 
- I still try to drop Princess Bride lines on TV whenever humanly possible probably much to the eye rolls of my entire audience. 
- That's hilarious, that's hilarious, that's great to know. 
- Thank you so much for being here and sharing with us. 
- My pleasure. Thank you, Kate.
