- Honoring the very best of us. And that does it for this edition of Andrea Mitchell Reports. Here's Ali Velshi from Stephanie Ruhle. 
- Andrea, have yourself a great afternoon, thank you. And hello everyone, it's Wednesday, July 3rd. Coming up this hour on Velshi and Ruhle the crisis at the border. We've got new gut-wrenching details about how children are being are being treated in US custody. It would be considered abuse if it happened in a home. So should immigration officials be held to account? Plus, President Trump says he's cutting prescription drug prices. For facts sake, thousands of drug prices are skyrocketing. We're gonna dig into the numbers for you. And military tanks have arrived on the national mall for President Trump's July 4th celebration. We'll look at the cost, plus concerns from the Pentagon. Today President Trump is insisting that his fight for adding a citizenship question to the census isn't over yet, saying in a tweet quote, The news reports about the Department of Commerce dropping it's quest to put the citizenship question on the census is incorrect or, to state it differently, fake! We are absolutely moving forward, as we must, because of the importance of the answer to this question. Now the statement, refuting his very own commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross who said, just 24 hours ago, this in part quote, The Census Bureau has started the process of printing the decennial questionnaires without the question. My focus, and that of the Bureau and the entire Department is to conduct a complete and accurate census. All of this of course, follows the Supreme Court recent decision to block the question from the 2020 Census. Joining me now NBC's White House correspondent, Kelly O'Donnell. Kelly, this one's a tricky one, because while the president often tweets things that are at odds wit his administration or his own government. The Commerce Department actually has to print the census and the census actually has to go out. This one seems to be easy to identify, what the story actually is. Why are the president and the Commerce Department not on the same page about this, literally? 
- Well, you could argue there are two different tracks. There's the practical piece of having to print the census with, in this case, no question about citizenship for those who participate, because 2020 is knocking on our door, in terms of the volume of what it takes to do a census. And in Wilbur Ross, the secretary's own name, you read the statement. This is very clearly coming from the Department of Commerce. We also heard from Justice Department officials, who told us that it was going forward with the printing. So, where is the second level? You could continue the legal challenge and make it an issue that could be resolved at some later date or, arguably, you could say you could reprint portions of the census or it could be for the next census. It's unclear, the president doesn't lay that out. So, it appears to be more political messaging that the president, who has taken a very strong position on this. Just Monday, he was asked about this question in the Oval Office. Would he attempt to delay the census, which is required by the Constitution. Not an everyday law, the Constitution that it be done every 10 years. He said he was strongly looking at that. So, the president wanting to stick with that position, but leaving, as he explained in the Oval on Monday, that this is a question he believes is appropriate and that it is the country's right to know who, among those participating, is a citizen, who is not. He didn't leave open the possibility for non-citizens who have permanent legal status in the United States, or those under protected status, like asylum seekers, he just had the either/or. So, it would appear that the government is doing what the government needs to do to begin that process of the every 10 year check on who and how many are among us. And the president is still saying he wants to fight this fight. It may be part of his political argument. It ties into so much else of the president's rhetoric. But there's a way for both to be true. But what we have not yet heard from the White House, and we've inquired, is does the president have a difference on the actual printing part of this. It would appear that ship is about to sail from one of his closest advisors, Wilbur Ross, saying, it's gonna happen. Ali. 
- Kelly, good to see you as always. Thank you Kelly O'Donnell for us at the White House. President Trump is celebrating the acquittal of a Navy Seal accused of murdering an ISIS fighter. Just a short time ago the president tweeted, Congratulations to Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher, his wonderful wife Andrea, and his entire family. You have been through much together. Glad I could help! It's an interesting last line, Glad I could help. This was a trial, how did the president help? Gallagher was accused of stabbing to death a young, wounded ISIS fighter in 2017. Then posing for a picture with the corpse. While Gallagher was found not guilty on six criminal charges, he was found guilt of posing for a photo with a casualty. It was a trial with a stunning twist. Another Navy Seal testified that he was the one who killed the boy by blocking his breathing tube in an act of mercy. Joining me now from San Diego, NBC's Steve Patterson's been covering the trial from the beginning. Steve, what help is the president talking about in that tweet? 
- So, the president isn't necessarily referring to the trial itself. He's referring to an act that occurred in the past. There was about a nine-month period after Gallagher was arrested on these very, extremely serious charges for war crimes over in a 2017 tour of duty, as you mentioned, in Mosul, in Iraq, where he was taken to a military brig. Again, arrested in the fall, I believe at his residence. Taken to the brig and confined there for a period of nearly a year, about nine months. The president takes credit for moving him out of the brig and back home, saying that the brig is only for people that were flight risks or that have significant risk of harming someone or themselves or, obviously, leaving the country. His argument was that Gallagher was at risk of doing none of that. He, of course, referenced this, as he does with most everything, in a tweet. Saying quote, In honor of his past service to our country, Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher will soon be moved to a less restrictive confinement while he awaits his day in court. Process should move quickly. It did move quickly. That was March, he was back home shortly after that. We spoke to members of Gallagher's defense team on their way into court this morning. They were praising, thanking President Trump for doing this saying that it allowed them to prepare a significant case, that they were obviously able to be successful in so many of the charges here. Saying that it was thanks to the president that he allowed all this press to usher in because of his exposure to the case. So they're very happy with the attention that the president has given this case. And, obviously, for whatever he did to move Gallagher from confinement to home so they could prepare for the trial that we just experienced, Ali. 
- All right Steve. Thanks very much, Steve Patterson for us in Los Angeles. All right, now to the race for the White House. Today, several Democratic candidates are campaigning in the key voter state of Iowa. Former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign just announced it raised 21-1/2 million dollars during it's second quarter alone. This as Senator Kamala Harris appears to be closing the gap on Biden's lead days after she challenged him on his record with race issues during the Democratic debate. A new Quinnipiac University poll shows Harris is up 13 points in the last three weeks, while front-runner Biden is down eight points. Harris stands at 20%, Biden at 22, which is a virtual tie when you consider the margin of error. Senator Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders follow. But according to the poll, when voters were asked who has the best chance of winning against President Trump, Biden maintains a strong 42%, Harris is at 14%. In another poll from The Washington Post and ABC News, the biggest jump again belongs to Senator Harris. In that poll though, Senator Bernie Sanders holds on to second place. Joining me now from Iowas, our road warriors: Vaughn Hillyard, Shaquille Brewster and Mike Memoli. Mike, you're following Joe Biden in Iowa today, let's talk about the second quarter for him in terms of fundraising compared to the other candidates we know so far. 
- Yeah Ali, well we saw last week the downsides of being the front runner. In that debate, Joe Biden put on the defensive by some of his opponents. And so, as he arrives today in Iowa for his first real campaign rally since the debate, a little bit of a show of force from the Biden campaign, announcing that second-quarter fundraising number: $21.5 million dollars since he entered the race in late April. I should mention, it's not as much as Mayor Pete Buttigeig, who reported raising more than 25 million. Bernie Sanders also with a number of 18 million. But that's more on a per-day basis, the Biden campaign points out, noting that he didn't get in until three weeks into, after the fundraising quarter began. I'll read a few of the statistics highlighted by the Biden campaign. Of course, NBC News has been keeping a close track of those high-dollar fundraisers. 27 that he's done since announcing. That brings in big numbers in a hurry. But the Biden campaign saying that 97% of all the donations they've received are from grass-roots donors. Those are in amounts of less than $200 or less. They also have more than 256,000 donors who gave a total of 436,000 donations. So obviously Ali, as Biden's a little bit on the defensive, having to deal with that tense debate exchange with Kamala Harris. A little bit of a reminder of the fact that he's not going anywhere. And a reminder from the Biden campaign, as well, that his dollars potentially go a lot longer than a Mayor Pete's, for instance, because he's got nearly universal name ID. He doesn't need to spend that money on TV ads establishing who he is to voters. He can invest that all in their grass roots and their infrastructure for their campaign going forward. 
- Mike, thank you. Vaughn Hillyard, Senator Harris is closing the gap on Biden nationally. You're covering a Kamala Harris event in Iowa today. A new USAToday/Suffolk University poll shows Biden continues to lead with 24%, Harris in second place at 16%. What's her plan to close the gap and keep the momentum? It's an important question, because Kamala Harris tends to have moments and she's got to fill up the space between those moments to keep that momentum going. 
- Yeah, you fill in the space by campaigning. She's here in Des Moines. She'll be appearing over here in West Des Moines at this park behind us here in just about an hour, before she heads over to the western part of the state. She'll hit the TV market in Council Bluffs, the Omaha area there. On Friday, she'll then hit the Sioux City television market. The Kamala Harris campaign said that they plan to hit the ground running and not let up. She was over in California holding fundraisers. In those first three days after the debate, they raised three-and-a half million dollars, the campaign said. The have not released their quarter totals, but it should be noted, she jumped in before anybody else in this campaign, raising $12,000,000 in that first quarter, giving her a leg up here compared to Mayor Pete Buttigeig and Joe Biden, who jumped into this race later on. But for this campaign, this is about painting contrasts at this point. Kamala Harris showed that she was willing to draw contrasts between herself and other Democratic candidates, particularly taking on Joe Biden on the issue of race, busing, on the Obama Administration's deportation policy at the debate. And now the question is going forward, to what extent will she continue to press the case, essentially prosecute the case against her fellow Democrats. And that starts here on the campaign trail. She's got two events today before heading on across Iowa the next two days. She'll be in New Orleans then on Saturday before going to South Carolina on Sunday and Monday. Ali. 
- All right. And Shaquille, according to the Quinnipiac University poll, Sanders is now in fourth place. You spoke with the campaign's senior advisor earlier. What is the Sanders' campaign doing to boost momentum and what's going on in Iowa? 
- Well, the say it's not affecting their strategy and that's why we have Senator Sanders about to open up this field office here in Iowa City. It's just an example of how the campaign wants to focus on what they call ground game, rather than that recent polling. And I spoke with Senator Sanders' chief of staff about that recent polling. A flood of polls since our debate last weekend. As we point out these polls, he's able to point out several more that show Sanders closing the gap with Vice President Biden, but also polls that show him ticking up a little bit. And that's why you have Senator Sanders, on this trip, going and participating in these retail politics events. So, instead of those big rallies that we normally see, he's doing ice cream socials. He's gonna be marching in Fourth of July parades. Really trying to have those interactions with voters. And this is a campaign in Iowa that has scaled up recently. So right now they have about 43 staffers, but the campaign notes that is lower than some of the other campaigns out there. They highlight their 25,000 volunteers, who these staffers are gonna be able to mobilize. Folks who are gonna knock on doors, make calls. That's why events like these are happening. He's gonna be opening up three offices throughout the state, and these are recruiting events, essentially. Hoping that they can pull in volunteers. Pull in people to support him come that caucus in February. 
- Shaquille Brewster, Mike Memoli, Vaughn Hillyard, thanks to the three of you, our road warriors on the campaign trail.

- Your entire business is profiting off of other people's information, then your job is to keep that information safe. This week we are getting a better understanding of the conditions inside detention centers run by Customs and Border Protection. And the descriptions give a stark look at how many desperate people fleeing violence and economic uncertainty at home are treated. The Department of Homeland Security's Office of the Inspector General touted five border facilities and two ports of entry in the Rio Grande Valley and released blunt findings. According to the report, about 3,400 detainees were held longer than 72 hours. That's the CBP guidelines for maximum holding time. In fact, 1,500 of them were held for more than 10 days. And it found 826 children were held longer than that 72 hour limit. That represents about 31% of the children who are held in Customs and Border Patrol custody. Despite Customs and Border Control requirements, that reasonable efforts to allow detainees to shower within 72 hours be made, the report found that some adults were unable to shower for up to a month. Detainees were given wet-wipes for personal hygiene and many only got bologna sandwiches, leading to cases of constipation. Requirements that children receive hot meals were also not being met. It found that detainees were held in overcrowded cells for up to a month. One senior manager described the situation as a ticking time bomb. Democratic lawmakers visited the detention facilities this week and many, including New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, took to Twitter and interviews to report on conditions. They described being told things like women were told that they could drink out of the toilets. They reported migrants being woken at odd hours for no reason and being subjected to disparaging language. They described it as psychological warfare. And a temporary restraining order filed by a human rights group quoted several children interviewed as saying things like, we're in a metal cage, it's very cold, lights are on all the time, I'm so hungry, we got sick, I've never been offered a shower. NBC's Gabe Gutierrez talked to a pediatrician who treated some of the children previously held in CBP detention. Here's what she had to say. 
- Children should not be in a place where they don't have access to their basic human needs. Where they don't have access to, if they are sick, a medical provider. It is detrimental, not only to their acute state, to what's happening right now, but to their future development and their mental health. 
- All right, joining me now MSNBC correspondent Jacob Soboroff. Jacob, the acting Secretary of Homeland Security is calling for an investigation. However, it's not into the conditions that I just laid out, that were in the Office of the Inspector General's report, it was something else. 
- Yeah, that's right. He's calling on the Office of Professional Responsibility, Ali, within DHS to investigate what they normally investigate, which is misconduct, a lack of standards inside the department being upheld. And the results of that investigation, as you said, will be specifically about these Facebook messages that have been uncovered by Propublica and what really was extraordinarily shocking and dehumanizing language that was being used by the folks that were inside this group. And it's a group of, a large amount of people. I think 9,500 people. But ultimately, it might come down to the acts and the language used by these specific agents, if indeed they were acting, current border patrol agents at the time they used those messages. 
- All right. The ACLU, Jacob, has just won a legal battle over asylum seekers. Can you tell us more about that and what it means for the people at the border and in these detention facilities? 
- Yeah, It's extraordinarily important, as a matter of fact, because Attorney General Barr wanted to hold asylum seekers in custody without any ability to bond themselves out. To get out by paying a bail or a bond. And, frankly, just hold them in detention for the pendancy of their asylum hearings and their immigration court hearings. It's another attempt to deter migration to this country by saying if you come here, try to declare asylum, we're gonna lock you up, basically. But at the end of the day, we're talking about asylum, we're not talking about criminals. And the judge seems to have sided, the judge clearly sided against Attorney General Barr here in that case, and the administration will not be able to lock people up who are here only because they want to seek asylum. 
- All right. The Washington Post, Jacob, is reporting about a child who died in May after spending time in Customs and Border Patrol custody. What do we know about this from the autopsy? 
- Again, it's a familiar refrain, Ali. Ultimately this child died of, the autopsy says, several diseases, parasites, influenza, and what the lawyer for the family is alleging, now that this autopsy is out, is that this child should have gotten treatment far before he and his mother were sent to a hospital once they were detained by Customs and Border Protection. I want to remind everybody that CBP was touting, for quite some time, that no child had died in their custody for 10 years. And since the Trump Administration began, six children have died in CBP custody over that period of time. This is just more details about one of those cases, specifically, and it raises a lot of red flags about why these children aren't getting treatment sooner. We now see all of these overcrowding conditions. All the conditions that a child like this would have been held in. But again, the question remains: Why aren't they getting help sooner? 
- All right. The Daily Beast is reporting that ICE agents told, said Happy Hunting as they prepared for a nationwide immigration raid coming after July 4th. Tell me about that. 
- Well, I wanna be clear about this report in particular. Happy hunting referred to immigration raids that were supposed to happen back in 2017, and this is not an isolated use of this dehumanizing phrase, happy hunting. Adiel Kaplan, a colleague of ours at NBC News, has also reported that the phrase happy hunting was also used by Border Patrol agents who were going to be doing random spot checks on Greyhound buses and other modes of transportation in the northeast of the United States within what's called that 100-mile zone that the Border Patrol is allowed to do searches on public transportation. The idea that we've seen these Facebook reports now of dehumanizing language towards members of Congress and towards immigrants in the custody of the US Government. That ICE agents are saying happy hunting when it comes to tracking down and conducting what are called interior removals inside this country. And Border Patrol agents have said the exact same thing about migrants that are potentially on buses in the northeast of the United States, far from the border, certainly suggest that there is a culture of using this type of language within CBP and we have not yet seen a response from CBP about this most recent report from The Daily Beast, Ali. 
- All right, Jacob, thank you for your reporting, as always. Jacob Soboroff for us in Los Angeles. Coming up next, the tanks have arrived!

- Welcome back to Velshi & Ruhle. Tomorrow we celebrate the United States 243rd birthday and President Trump is preparing for his Salute to America event. It's a very different kind of celebration than what Washington DC is used to as tanks and armored personnel carriers arrived in the Capital on flatbed trucks over the past few days. The president is touting the present of M4 Sherman tanks, which are World War II-era vehicles he describes as brand new, along with the more modern M1 Abrams tanks. APCs, represented by the Bradley Fighting vehicle, will also flank the ceremony. The president's event is gonna take place at the Lincoln Memorial, where a source tells NBC News he'll give remarks described as uplifting and patriotic, but not political. Joining me now, NBC Pentagon correspondent Courtney Kube. Courtney, let's talk about the logistics of the military display. This isn't typical. What's been the reaction from the Petagon? It's been very complicated to get some of these big tanks into DC. 
- Yeah, absolutely. Well, you have to remember, that when you have something like an Abrams tank that weighs tons and tons, you can't just can't drive it down a normal street. It's actually not uncommon for large military vehicles to be moved via rail. You know, if you go to some of these bases, we were down in Camp Lejeune a couple months ago, they have railway tracks where they move some of their larger vehicles. So that's what they did here. They brought these Abrams tanks up from Fort Stewart in Georgia, via rail, and then they stuck on flatbeds and drove them into the city, because they were so concerned about the weight, but also the treads. You know, these are tracked vehicles and the treads can tear up the street. You know, there's been a lot of question about how is the Pentagon? How are military leaders reacting to this? There's been widespread concern from military leaders and officials who we've spoken to over the past several months. Since the idea of this parade even came up and making it dedicated to the military and having a large military involvement. But at the end of the day, the Pentagon lawyers reviewed the plan and they approved it, and they said this is an appropriate thing for the US military to participate in and to be apart of Ali. 
- Is there any, I just want to be clear on this, if the military had a problem with it, would they be compelled to send people? 
- Uh, no. I mean, if they had a problem with it and it was considered to be an illegal activity, they of course would not be involved in it. If the attorneys found out that there was some way be a conflict of interest for them. But you know as I said, it's not. And so the military is participating. There's also been some questions sbout why is it that some of the more senior members of the Joint Chiefs aren't attending? Like Army Chief of Staff Mark Milley. The Commandant of the Marine Corps, General Neller. Well, we've been told by numerous military officials, of course we've been asking all week who's gonna be attending? And the reality is, this came up kind of at the last minute, this parade, and a lot of these people already had plans. Some of them plan to be out of town. Some of them plan to be on leave. You know, Fourth of July isn't a traditional military holiday, in that the military participate in a lot of events, so a lot of these guys planned to take time off, Ali. 
- Yeah. Courtney, thank you for your reporting on this. We'll keep a close eye on it. Courtney Kube joining us from the Pentagon. Joining us now, California Democratic Congressman Gil Cisneros. He's a member of the Armed Services and Veterans' Affairs Committee. He is a veteran himself. Congressman, good to see you. Thank you for joining us. 
- Well, thank you for having me. 
- We have been discussing, as you've heard, concern that the president's Fourth of July celebration is heavy on military pageantry and could feel more like a taxpayer-funded campaign rally. What's your take on this? I mean, do you have a view about the military participation? There is always a parade. This one just seems to have a bit more of a military component, and a bit more of a political component. 
- Well, the Fourth of July should be about celebrating our independence, celebrating democracy. You know, for celebrating our military, we have Veterans' Day. I think what he's doing right now is turning this event into a spectacle. That's not that something that we need and, like your last guest just said, a lot of the generals aren't gonna be there because they already made plans. Unfortunately for these service members, they're gonna have to be there with the tanks. They're gonna have to be there with this aircraft for the flyovers. The plans that they had made had to be canceled and now they're gonna have to spend it here on the parade instead of spending it with their families and friends. 
- All right, we're hearing that the DNC didn't get any tickets to the president's event. We heard Kellyanne Conway saying it's a public event. What do you know about this? 
- Well, I know I wasn't offered any tickets, to offer anything to my constituents. You know, this is what this president is doing. He's turning it into, basically, a campaign rally for himself. This is not what the Fourth of July is supposed to be about. This is supposed to be a non-partisan event. It's supposed to be celebrating the birth of our nation, the birth of our democracy. And, really, he's turning into an event completely for himself. Somewhere that he can highlight himself. In which I'm sure he will use. We'll see some of these highlights in campaign footage later on. 
- Let's talk about immigration. You are in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. A group that has been very, very upset about the way things are going in these detention centers, and at the border generally. What's your sense of Congress' plan to take action? We saw this Inspector General's report from the Department of Homeland Security. Which is scathing and flies right in the face of what DHS officials and leaders of these very departments and the administration has been saying about these detention centers. The DHS report is right in line what our reporters, and what you members of Congress have been reporting about these centers, and in complete contrast to what the administration is saying. 
- Well, the DHS report is just confirming what we've been hearing all along. That the situation down there in these facilities is atrocious. You know, we're treating these individuals who are coming here to this country just trying to seek a better life for themselves, for their families. We're treating them worse than we treat prisoners in our penitentiaries. It's something that needs to change and that why I couldn't support the Appropriations, the Border Appropriation Supplemental Bill that passed through the House, passed through the Senate last week that the president's gonna sign. It wasn't gonna change any of the policies were going. It's gonna be business as usual for CBP. Business as usual for Homeland Security, for ICE. And we need real action that's gonna really change the conditions that's going on in these facilities. 
- But 4.3 billion dollars, that can't be business as usual, right? That can't possibly be. 
- Well, I think a lot of it is gonna go. We know what they were doing. There's nothing in that bill that's gonna change what was going on. There's nothing that's gonna change the standards. There's nothing that's gonna make it mandatory that they see a physician. I mean, we're hearing about these children are dying because nobody's looked at them. They have the flu. They have things that could be treated simply, that we have the medication, the medicine to do, and they're not getting that treatment, and there's nothing that was in this bill that's gonna change that policy at all. 
- Okay, I understand what you're saying. It doesn't change policy. But it does fund things that we understand had problems with funding. I guess I worry about what you think of as a very good humanitarian bill, that may not be achievable and voting against one that was achievable. 
- Well, this is the thing that we need to keep pushing for, right, in the House. And it's something that I'm gonna be vocal about, is we need to kind of keep pushing for the humanitarian treatment of these individuals that are in these facilities. We need to make sure they can see a physician. We need to make sure that they're gonna get hot meals. That it's not a bologna sandwich. And again, it's good that they're gonna be able to get more bologna sandwiches, but that's not what they need. We need something, we need policy, we need to change a bill that's gonna actually change policy to make sure that these children see a doctor. To make sure that the families are getting a hot meal. That they're gonna have a toothbrush. That they're gonna be able to get a shower there. 
- Congressman, thanks for the time you've taken. I appreciate it. Congreessman Gil Cisneros is a member of the Armed Services and Veterans' Committee. All right.

- President Trump has been promising to lower prescription drug prices, but it appears that some are actually spiking. For facts sake, the government's own data shows prices increased by 1.2% in May compared to the same month last year. New analysis by RX Savings Solutions, it's a consultant for employers and for health plans, shows that the price of more than 3,400 drugs increased on an average of 17% compared to the same time last year. What else in your life is up 17%? The average hike was about 10.5%, or about five times the rate of inflation, or about five times the rate by which your paycheck may have gone up over the same period. At least 41 drugs increased by more than 100%. It includes one version of fluoxetine, which is the generic antidepressant Prozac, up 879%! This is a generic. Mometasone, which is a topical steroid cream, increased by 381%, Promethazine/Codeine, a pain reliever and cough medication, went up 326%. In fact, just this past Monday, 20 companies raised the list prices of more than 104 prescription drugs an average of 13%. One of them is a drug called isolyte. It's a saline solution that's been used to hydrate patients in hospitals for years, essentially salt water, it was up 100%. With me now NBC Medical Corespondent Dr. John Torres to explain some of this stuff. John, good to see you. 
- Good to see you as well. 
- I dwell in economics, you dwell in medicine. I can never figure out how to make sense of drugs and the costs and the increases. 
- And I don't think you're alone, and you're very well informed. Yet, you go to the pharmacy, you get your drug, you try to pay for it and you find out, the same drug you used a year ago, all of a sudden has doubled in price, and you don't really know why. And I think the word you're gonna hear a lot coming up in the next few months and next few years is transparency. And I think that's the biggest problem we have here is those drug prices aren't transparent and nobody really has any idea how those prices are even set. How the insurance companies decide what to charge. And then we have these things called PBMs. They're kind of the middleman. 
- Pharmacy Benefit Managers. 
- Exactly. They take their cut as well, and so there's a lot of hands in that pie trying to find out how to get money, and I think that's part of the issue. 
- The PBMs are negotiating with drug makers. They're negotiating with your health plan, your insurance company and the pharmacies, and that's sort of the black box. We don't know what happens in there. 
- Exactly, and it is a black box, because magic goes on in there and all of a sudden a drug price pops out. And that drug price can change from month to month and people see that all the time. 
- And different for you and me and someone paying cash and someone with a coupon. 
- It completely depends on your insurance or whether you have insurance or not. What it is. You can even have the same insurance, but have different contracts in that insurance and getting charged different amounts of money. You just don't know. 
- As a journalist in 2019, we are able to and have to be critical of the president and the administration a lot. But there have been a lot of people who understand this world who say that President Trump has been trying to make progress on this. It felt important to him to do so and he is frustrated by his Health and Human Services secretary, Alex Azar, who, by the way, is a former drug executive, for not getting more done. What do we know about what's going on? What efforts there are to bring these prices down when what we're seeing is the prices go up? 
- So, they're trying to bring these prices down, but they're trying to do it piecemeal. So, they go into the pharmacy companies and saying, Hey, can you help lower your prices a little bit? They're going to the PBMs and saying, maybe we should make some regulations where they're not able to get that piece of the pie that they wanna get, and that's gonna lower prices. They're going to pharmacies and saying, don't distribute them for such a big price. They problem is, there's so many different entities involved with this. Last month, I was in Germany looking at their healthcare system and they have a system set up where it's all very transparent. Everybody comes together at the beginning to decide one, if it's a drug worth actually selling in the country, using does it help anything, and two, what's the price we're gonna set on this drug. Everybody there has a co-pay of 10 euros a month, so no matter what drug you get it's 10 euros a month. And it's just the way their system is set up. And that's only been for the last decade or so. It's a new system. 
- Well, we need something in this country. This is a great drug system for people who make money off of it, but if you actually have to pay for drugs in this country it's very frustrating. Wanna hear what you think. John, thanks very much for being with us. And please send me an e-mail or tweet me your thoughts on what you think can be done about drug prices in this country. All right, another piece of news for you. The legendary automobile visionary, Lee Iacoca, passed away Tuesday at his California home of complications with Parkinson's. Now, many of you will remember Lee Iacocca. He entered the automobile industry as an engineering trainee for Ford Motors when he was 22-years old. Through a series of successes, including with the invention of the Mustang, Iacocca became the president of Ford at just 46-years old. Now because of tensions between Iacocca and Henry Ford II, he left for a position with Chrysler just eight years later and that is a move that saved the company. Chrysler was debt-ridden and losing millions of dollars. Iacocca saved the company from bankruptcy by introducing the fuel-efficient K-car line, allowing the company to make several different models of cars on one chassis at a time. He introduced the Chrysler Minivan, which led the auto industry for years. Bringing Chrysler back into competition. Safe to say, Lee Iacocca remade the automobile industry before retiring in 1992. He made his name known by appearing in commercials. He was listed as one of the world's most respected men in a mid-1980s Gallup poll, only behind President Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II. His name even came up as a potential presidential contender in 1988. Lee Iacocca was 94-year old. We'll be right back.

- Welcome back to Velshi & Ruhle. A new NBC exclusive report suggests the tension between Silicon Valley and Capital Hill is intensifying. The report details how tech advocacy groups are now pushing back on legislation aimed at regulating major tech giants, which was introduced by a Republican senator, Josh Hawley, last month. AdNow, tech-focused non-profits in DC are fearing a quote partisan blood match between big companies and top regulators. Joining me now, NBC political reporter, the one who wrote the story, Allan Smith. Allan, what's this about? Why is Hawley, a conservative, the guy putting forward legislation to regulate tech companies and what's the larger concern? 
- So first off, Senator Hawley, a first-term senator from Missouri. He's come in and he's wanting to be the Republican who's really at the forefront of some of these tech regulations battles, right? He's splitting with Republican orthodoxy and he wants to have a much more activist government in this regard. Now this bill that he's proposed is super controversial, and there's a lot of pushback from groups that aren't directly aligned with Google and Facebook. What the bill would do simply is remove some of the protections that major tech companies enjoy under what's known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. 
- [Ali] Which was written in the 90s. 
- Yes. 
- And a lot of people feel that it's a little antiquated, a little out of date. 
- A little bit. So, this law provides freedom from liability for these tech companies for stuff that third-party users post on their platform. 
- [Ali] Backpage would be the best example, right? 
- Yes. 
- Backpage made the argument that we're just a site that people put stuff on. You can't hold us liable for the content. 
- Absolutely. So, what Hawley's bill does is it changes that immunity, so that these companies would have to apply for it every two years from the FTC, and the FTC would vote. You would need a super majority, four out of five commissioners would vote if the company's practices are quote politically neutral. So Hawley's side says, look with a super majority of the FTC commissioners having to get on board, you would have a bi-partisan response. But we both know, very well, that Republicans and Democrats don't really agree on a definition of politically neutral right now. And some of these companies could just get stuck in this purgatory where they're not receiving immunity, and then you could have a situation where, you know, if every single piece of content these companies could be liable for, they'll end up with much wider-spread censorship. They're gonna have to review every piece of content that goes up on their website. 
- All right. This is definitely one that we are going to continue to follow with you. Thank you Allan Smith, NBC News reporter. We are seeing record closings on all three major indices right now. Might be a little early for us to tell you about this, but, in fact, markets closed early today because tomorrow is the July 4th holiday. You are looking at three new records. The Dow is at 29,966. Standard and Poor's just half-a-point shy of 3,000 points and the NASDAQ closing at yet at yet another record, 8,170 points. I want to talk about Nike's latest controversy. It's all about an historical flag put on a shoe. To some that flag's a symbol of hate, to others America's revolution. We're gonna look at all sides of the debate and how Nike handled the situation.

- [Announcer] Corey is living with metastatic breast cancer. Which is breast cancer that has spread to other parts of her body. She's also taking Ibrance with an aromatase inhibitor, which is for post-menopausal women or for men with HR-positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer as the first hormonal-based therapy. Ibrance plus letrozole was significantly more effective at delaying disease progression versus letrozole. Patients taking Ibrance can develop low white blood cell counts, which may cause serious infections that can lead to death. Before taking Ibrance, tell your doctor if you have fever, chills, or other signs of infections, liver or kidney problems, or pregnant, breast-feeding, or plan to become pregnant. Common side-effects include low red blood cell and low platelet counts, infections, tireness, nausea, sore mouth, abnormalities in liver-blood tests, diarrhea, hair thinning or loss, vomiting, rash, and loss of appetite. Corey calls it her new normal, because a lot has changed. But a lot hasn't. Ask your doctor about Ibrance, the number one prescribed, FDA-approved oral combination treatment for HR-positive/HER2-negative NBC.

- Today Nike and Colin Kaepernick are back in the center of controversy and this time it's over sneakers. Nike is pulling these shoes from its inventory, which feature the so-called Betsy Ross-version of the American flag. Now to some people, that is a flag representing hate and slavery because it was in place at a time when slavery was enshrined in the United States. To others, it's a patriotic symbol of the Revolutionary War. NBC's Stephanie Gosk has more. 
- [Stephanie] Nike's decision to pull these red, white and blue shoes emblazoned with a colonial-era flag is whipping even more controversy. The Governor of Arizona threatening to pull incentives for a Nike manufacturing plant in his state, calling Nike's recall a shameful retreat. Adding, words cannot express my disappointment at this terrible decision. The future of the facility, which would employ about 500 people, is unclear. According to The Wall Street Journal, former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick spearheaded the call to get Nike to pull the shoe. Citing people familiar with the matter, the report says he was offended by the use of the flag, as were others. In a statement Nike says its decision to recall the design was based on concerns that it could unitentionally offend and detract from the nation's patriotic holiday. When the iconic brand revealed the shoe late last month, critics spoke out, one writing, Nike you should be ashamed of this shoe. Another wrote, Can't wait for the Confederate Air Max 90s. The so-called Betsy Ross flag, named after the 18th-century woman mythologized for designing it, has been flown at some nationalist and American Nazi rallies. Some say it celebrates the time of slavery. While others, including Texas senator, Ted Cruz, are renewing calls for a Nike boycott. Cruz tweeting in part, Their shoes represent snide disdain for the American flag. Similar calls were made when Nike partnered with Caepernick last year in an ad campaign. 
- [Colin] Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything. The former quarterback was the first in the NFL to kneel during the national anthem, protesting police brutality and racial injustice. Some burned their shoes and boycotted Nike. While the company saw its sales rise and it's stock price surge. 
- Joining me now is NBC's Stephanie Gosk. Stephanie, I was just saying to you, I think that in 25 years, when we study the culture wars of this era, this will be a case study. 
- That's right. The moment a sneaker is at the center of the culture wars. 
- And everybody's very dug in on their position on this one. 
- Yeah, they certainly are. You know, you could make the argument there's a conversation we need to have. There are clearly people who are on both sides of this who are very agitated and upset for, quite honestly, understandable reasons. Where do we come together to talk about it is really the crucial question. 
- I was surprised in your piece, and when I looked at the story, to find that people associate this so-called Betsy Ross flag. It's not clear Betsy Ross designed it, she may have just changed the star design, with the same feelings that people have for the Confederate flag. 
- Right. It's certainly not an overwhelming feeling and something that's been in the public. But there have been these limited examples. For instance, there was a chapter of the Ku Klux Klan that had some flyers in upstate New York that used the flag to try to recruit people. 
- [Ali] Right. 
- To their chapter. That's obviously pretty limited. There were a couple of high school students at a high school football game a couple of years ago that were waving the flag and then later the superintendent came out and apologized for that saying that this flag had become what he called, a symbol of hate. But those were limited examples and this controversy, clearly the most widespread that we've seen when it comes to this flag. 
- This hasn't really hurt Nike stock price, and Nike has been through controversies. But Nike understands branding, possibly more than most other companies in the world. Is it interesting that it got to this point without Nike having figured out that there might be some controversy around this. 
- It is, and I also think it's a statement on just how controversial this flag really is. Because like you say, branding, for Nike, is second nature. They have almost defined branding for us in the modern world. 
- None of us knew what that swoosh was until they invented it. 
- Of marketing, yeah. And signing Kaepernick, you know, in those moments when there was a lot of criticism, which they knew they were going to get. The burning of the shoes and the rest of it. In those immediate moments after that, they did actually see their stock price go up and their shoe--
