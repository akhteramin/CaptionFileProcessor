- [Announcer] Calm today. 
- All right, that wraps us this hour of MSNBC Live. My friend Ali Velshi is here to pick up our coverage. 
- Nice to see you again 24 hours later. It was fun working with you yesterday when we were covering a difficult story. But thank you for you coverage this afternoon. Are you done? 
- Happy to be here. I am done. 
- [Ali] All right, have yourself a great rest of the day. 
- You too. 
- See you. All right, good afternoon. I'm Ali Velshi. It's Friday, July 5th, two o'clock in the East where a deadline has just passed for the White House to announce whether it will keep fighting to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. A federal judge in overseeing one of three separate lawsuits over the question ruled that the Trump administration must explain how it's going to proceed by two p.m. today. President Trump addressed the controversy with reporters earlier. 
- [Reporter] Are you going to issue an executive order on the census? 
- We're thinking about doing that. It's one of the ways. We have four or five ways we can do it. It's one of the ways that we're thinking about doing it very seriously. We're doing well on the census. No, he made a statement. He wrote something up. The judge didn't like it. I have a lot of respect for Justice Roberts, but he didn't like it. But he did say come back. Essentially, he said come back. That's what he was saying. So we'll see what happens. 
- [Ali] The case seemed all but settled just a few days ago. The Supreme Court ruled last week that the Commerce Department's current justification for putting the question on the census was not legally sound, calling it contrived and the government has even begun printing copies of the census without the question included. But earlier this week, the President, reportedly spurred on by Conservative allies, announced on Twitter that his administration will once again take up the fight, sending White House lawyers scrambling over the holiday to come up with a new argument. Joining me now, NBC News justice correspondent Pete Williams. Pete you had a lot of specific guidance that you've been giving us through the day about-
- 
- Pardon me for, I'm just gonna look away. This is going to panic everyone that's speaking to me in my ear. I'm listening, but I'm looking at something that's just been filed, so go ahead. 
- That's what we were waiting for. There was a two p.m. deadline for a filing in which the government either had to say, We're gonna continue on with this fight, or it could say, We're not continuing. The two p.m. deadline, the most important thing that would happen is if we heard the government say we're giving it up. 
- Can you bring that to me? 
- So that's essentially what we're waiting for. If the government doesn't choose to withdraw its fight to add a citizenship question, then things continue as they are. The census will be printed. The government will have to figure out a new way to get it on there, and that may not happen. 
- So this is what's, just a second ago, been filed by the government. And no surprise here, they say, We're gonna keep fighting. They filed what they call their proposed discovery plan and what they say is they lay out a schedule for how to continue in this Maryland lawsuit, the separate lawsuit from the Supreme Court case on the census form. So no surprise here, the government says it wants to continue fighting. 
- So while you read that, here's what I wanna lay out. The government says it's gonna continue fighting. For the moment, the government continues to print the census forms, because that was the argument they used, that they needed a judgment or at least some kind of guidance from the Supreme Court before June 30th in order to print these forms. So those forms continue to be printed. The government's not giving up its fight. Logistically, Pete, what happens next? 
- Okay. 
- What can happen? 
- All right, so here are the options based on what I've just been able to read from what the government has filed and what the other side in this case has filed. So first, we have the Supreme Court case. That was started from a lawsuit filed by 18 states, led by New York, went to the US Supreme Court. Last week, the Supreme Court said this explanation that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross gave for why he wanted the question in the form, clearly, it doesn't wash. It's a pretext. You can't print the census if that's the basis for wanting it on the form. So the Supreme Court has ordered the government not to print the census with that question on it. And in fact, it's now printing it without that question. So what are the alternatives? One is Wilbur Ross could come up with a new justification for it that would start a whole new round of litigation. The government clearly thinks that's not a very productive way because they thought earlier this week, it was all over, and then the President said, You gotta keep trying. Another possibility that the President himself raised today is the President simply signs an executive order directing the Commerce Department to tell the Census Bureau to put this question on the form. That, again, would start a whole new round of litigation. Anything the government does from hereon is-
- 
- Let's just stop at that one for a second, an executive order. The President, this president certainly believes it, and by the way, he's not the first president to think so, that certain things can be done by executive order. But is the President clear that an executive order to put the question on the census doesn't mean that the census gets printed with the citizenship question on it? 
- Correct. It's not gonna do it by itself because that will immediately produce another court challenge. Anything the government does from hereon is gonna produce a court challenge. That's a certainty. So back to your question, using the word logistics, how long would that take? How long does the government have before it really can't? It has to just keep printing the forms without the question. I don't think anybody has a good clear answer to when the final drop dead date is for not tinkering around with this thing any further. It's gonna cost a lot of money if they throw away all the forms they've already printed and start over again. Another option though would be to either include this citizenship question on the longer form, the household survey that goes to just a small percentage of US households, or an additional form, an additional question that goes with the short form that goes to all households, just a simple piece of paper that says, Are you a US citizen, yes or no, what they wanted to put on the form in the first place. Now that too, I think, will lead to litigation because the groups opposed to this say it would have the same kind of chilling effect. But, you know, as we think through all this, remember, no matter what you may think of this as a policy matter, whether it's a wise thing to put this on the form, whether it will lead to an under count, or whether it will give us more information, that's a balancing test, just recall that throughout most censuses in American history, there has been a citizenship question. So the government has some weight on its side if it can come up with a rationale that satisfies these challenges. Now one other point. The President said today, when he was asked, Why do you want this question on the form, said, Well, you need it to figure out how many seats a state gets in the House. That is demonstrably not true. No apportionment throughout our history, and we've just celebrated another birthday, has ever been based on just counting citizens. It's always been total inhabitants. And that was clear from the constitutional convention and clear from when Congress enacted the 14th Amendment which gave further guidance on how to conduce a census. So in that sense, you don't need citizenship data to apportion a membership in the house. 
- Pete, I'm gonna give you the option. You can hang out with me while I bring Barbara McQuade in. I do know that you have some reading to do. So you're welcome to sit in front of that camera and do the reading. And if you hear something you want, chime in. 
- Okay. 
- Let's bring former US Attorney from the Eastern District of Michigan, Barbara McQuade in. Barbara, there's a lot to get through here. This seemed like a simple question at one time. Can you put the citizenship question on the census or not? Now it's gotten complicated because the Supreme Court said that the Commerce Department's reasoning was not appropriate for doing so. But they didn't say that means, to Pete's earlier point, that a citizenship question can't be on the census. Basically, the Supreme Court said to the government, You can come back with a better reason and try again. 
- Well, they can, but it has to be a genuine reason. And what the court found was that the reason that they gave, that the purpose was so that they could better comply with the Voting Rights Act, was a lie, was a pretext. The word they used was contrivance. And they said, If you wanna try again and tell us the real reason, we'll consider that. But it's hard to imagine that they could come back and say, Oh, when we told you it was about the Voting Rights Act, we just made a mistake. The real reason was the following. It's hard to imagine that any new reason they came up with, you know, my dog ate it, is something that could be believed. And so it's hard to imagine, going forward, that there's going to be a path to victory here for President Trump. 
- Now, there's another issue, and that is that the government's lawyers went to the Supreme Court and said, We kinda need this done in a hurry because we gotta print these forms by June 30th in order to get them printed and distributed on time. Now, when you go back to the Supreme Court and you say, Yeah, you know that deadline we told you we really needed it done by. Because we have different reasons, we can push that deadline. Does that affect the credibility of the government's lawyers in front of the Supreme Court? Or is that not important? 
- No, it absolutely does. And every lawyer who works for the Department of Justice knows that not only like every lawyer do they have a duty of candor to the tribunal, but the Justice Department has an even higher duty, as lawyers on behalf of the United States, to tell the truth. And in fact, here, it wasn't just a passing statement that they made that could be characterized as a slip of the tongue. They actually affirmatively said, We don't have time to go through the normal route of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals because time is of the essence and this is of such public importance that we need to skip that ordinary step and go directly to the Supreme Court because June 30th is our absolute deadline for getting these things printed. To now go back and say, We made that up, I think would harm the Justice Department not only in this case, but the Justice Department every other case it litigates everyday around the country. 
- [Ali] Pete? 
- Well, just this is a very short thing that the government filed here, and I don't think it really changes a lot of what we've said, but just to amplify one thing. They say, Right, Judge. We're currently enjoined in printing a census questionnaire that includes the citizenship question. We're not doing it. But any new decision by the Commerce Department on providing another rationale for why it wants to do this would constitute a new final agency action, and plaintiffs will be fully entitled to challenge the decision at that time. So that goes back to what we were saying earlier, Ali, that if the Commerce Secretary says, Oh, now, here's why I wanna do it, that will lead to another round of litigation. So all they say is in the event the Commerce Department adopts a new rationale, the government will immediately notify this court, that's the judge in Maryland, so it can determine whether there's any need for further proceedings or relief. So that's the separate Maryland case that did not go to the Supreme Court that's still simmering. 
- All right. Thank you for your great reporting on this, Pete Williams and Barbara McQuade. Thank you for your excellent analysis, as always. Barbara McQuade is a former US Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan. Pete Williams, our justice reporter who'll continue to report on this as he gets through the documents. All right, if it's the first Friday of the month, it must be jobs day, and June's job numbers appear to be a correction from May's dismal showing. 224,000 net new jobs were added last month. That's a good number. Don't let anybody tell you otherwise. Unemployment ticked up slightly from 3.6 to 3.7%. Hourly earnings are up 3.1%, year over year. Now, that looks pretty good. Remember that you always have to subtract inflation from that. All eyes are now on the Federal Reserve where Chairman Jerome Powell is going to have to decide whether or not these numbers warrant slashing interest rates. Joining me now, CNBC's John Harwood. I mean, this is a tough one for the President to spin because on one hand, he really, he likes the job numbers almost as much as he likes the stock market numbers. But touting strong job numbers means that the Fed now has to reconsider whether or not to cut interest rates, which the President really wants the Fed to do. 
- That's right, Ali. It won't constraint the President. He's gonna continue to want that interest rate cut because growth in the economy is slowing from 2018, and he wants it to rev up again going into the 2020 election year. But the Fed, which weighs data, has got to figure out whether or not this indicates that it would be too early to make a rate cut in light of these jobs numbers. We did have a downward revision on April and June, or excuse me, April and May, so that is a negative in that picture. But nevertheless, these are good numbers. And Jay Powell, in his last press conference, said that they removed the word patience from their guidance and they indicated that they were going to be inclined, if the data suggested, to cut rates one or more times in the rest of the year, but this makes that decision more difficult. 
- You know, the one thing that the President wants is he wants to goose those growth numbers. They are a little slower. We do not appear to be in recession territory or even close to it at this point, but they're smaller than they were, and they're smaller than the President had promised when he ran in his election. If you recall, he said, My economists think it will be 3%. I think it could be 4, 5 and 6%. That is the one lever that the government has, in theory. If you lower interest rates, it's like hitting the gas pedal on the economy, right? That's the thing that can cause growth to increase, because it becomes cheaper to borrow money. Money is more available. People invest. They build plants. They buy houses, things like that. That's right. And it's all the more important for him to hit the gas pedal since his other foot's hitting the brake with the trade war. The uncertainty and the friction with China, the disruption of supply chains, the higher consumer prices as a result pose some risk to the economy. It's not clear whether or not if you cut rates, that that would work on the same timeframe that the trade war is doing to the economy, but the fact that he's pulled back a little bit in recent days from conflict with China, that in itself is good news for the economy. And this is one way he can make it go faster if Jay Powell decides to go along. But of course, Jay Powell is independent, and I think he values his reputation for independence, so he'll make his own decision. 
- John, you had a chance to sit down with Beto O'Rourke and talk about some of his economic policies. 
- Let me ask you about your experience as a small businessman, both the web services company, the alt weekly. Do you look upon that as a success? And what do you take from it as you think about the economic challenges of the country? 
- Yeah. So I do look at it as a success, to be able, with good friends, far more talented, smarter than I was, to come together and create opportunity and jobs in the third poorest urban county in the United States, high-value, high-skill, high-tech jobs in El Paso, Texas. That felt really good. It was really hard to do, but I'll tell you, I had some advantages that other Americans don't. And I'll give you an example. I could not get a loan in 1998 to start a technology company in El Paso. I just didn't have the assets that the bank would lend against. But my dad, who had a home that was fully paid for, could take out a loan on his home and then lend that money back to me, 20,000 bucks. That was the seed capital that allowed us to start a business, that ultimately hired dozens of our fellow El Pasoans and served clients all over this country. 
- You know, John, I often think that people who have small business experience could be very useful to our country. You don't have to have macroeconomic experience. What was your takeaway? Because you talk to people about business and economics and their understanding of it all the time. 
- Well, that's a selling point for Beto O'Rourke in this race. He started a business. It's still going 20 years later. It was a profitable business. The publishing, the alt weekly that he founded went out of business, but the tech services company that he's no longer an owner of it is continuing to operate. The point he went on to make in that discussion was that he is mindful that very few Americans have families that can stake them to $20,000 to start a small business. A lot of his small business proposals are designed to extend more credit, more tax incentives to communities of color where wealth inequality has suppressed the formation of small business, and that's a big talking point for him in the race. 
- I skipped lunch, which is a bad idea, and I kept watching you while you were eating and trying to figure out what you ate. What were you eating? 
- I was eating the enchilada platter, half red sauce, half green sauce. It was delicious. He had tacos, though as you can see, he was talking most of the time and not inclined to pick 'em up. 
- [Ali] I enjoy interview like that, where someone else is talking and I'm eating. 
- [John] Right. (chuckles) 
- And good to see you, my friend. Thank you, John Harwood-
- 
- You bet, thank you. 
- Editor-at-large at CNBC. All right, still to come, the President once again blames the border crisis on Democrats, saying they're treating border agents unfairly. He even accused some lawmakers of lying. I'll get the reaction from Texas Democrat Congressman Marc Veasey who toured border facilities this week. But first, Joe Biden admits he was blindsided by Kamala Harris's confrontation at the first debate, and why Biden says despite sliding polls, he's still the best pick to take on Donald Trump. 
- Hi. 
- [Woman] Look at how great you look. 
- Thank you. (chuckles)

- I cannot wait to keep talking about 2020. I gotta tell you, I think it's fascinating. 
- Your entire business is profiting off of other people's information, then your job is to keep that information safe. All right, as the Democratic presidential candidates race to qualify for the next debate, we've got new fundraising numbers to report. Moments ago, Senator Kamala Harris's campaign announced it raised nearly $12 million in the second quarter. Still in the lend, South Bend, Indiana mayor, Pete Buttigieg's campaign announced Monday it raised $24.8 million. Front runner Biden trails him with $21.5 million in the quarter. Montana governor Steve Bullock, only entered the race in mid-May and mid-quarter, has raised a surprising $2 million. Former Vice President Joe Biden is addressing those fiery debate comments from 2020 opponent Senator Kamala Harris criticizing his decades-old senate fight against desegregation of busing and his comments on working with segregationist senators. In a new CNN interview, Biden said Harris's comments were unexpected. 
- I mean, it's so easy to go back and go back 30, 40, 50 years and take a context and take it completely out of context. And I mean, you know, I get all this information about other people's past and what they've done and not done and you know, I'm just not gonna go there. 
- Biden also expresses confidence in defeating President Trump. A new Quinnipiac University national poll shows his 42% lead in that category. 
- The idea that I'd be intimidated by Donald Trump, he's the bully that I knew my whole life. He's the bully that I've always stood up to. He's the bully who used to make fun when I was a kid and stuttered and I'd smack them in the mouth. 
- All right, joining me now is NBC political reporter, Ali Velshi, just in time for this afternoon's Ali V segment, Ali Vitali. I guess that would be your name. I'd be Ali Velshi. It gets confusing. 
- It's okay. 
- Ali V, talk to me about Harris's campaign talking about what Joe Biden said, saying this wasn't an attack. 
- Well, it clearly was an attack. And I think that they were definitely prepared for it. You and I have talked about this before. And Lily Adams was on CNN today basically saying the fact that he wasn't prepared for it, she's not quite sure why that happened, but the Kamala Harris campaign came in, and this is what debates are, to kind of separate the field and show the differences. I do think that there's a reticence on Joe Biden's part to be apologetic for his past record. And it's difficult to run on this argument of electability and experience when you're not really ready to defend the experience portion of it, specifically when you look at 30 years of policymaking decisions. Things look different over the course of time. And I covered a candidate who was reticent to apologize in the past. Joe Biden is not Donald Trump. And so I think that this is a strategy that I'm not sure how effective it's going to be going down the line in this campaign as there are gonna be a lot more policies that come up about Joe Biden's past that the other candidates are gonna want to litigate. 
- Harris, the polling that we were showing, seems to be closing the gap. That new Quinnipiac University poll shows her numbers have surged 13 points. Joe Biden's have surged eight points. But in a different question, when people are asked who can beat Donald Trump, Joe Biden's still way ahead. I guess to some degree, Kamala Harris taking on Joe Biden in that debate was about showing I can beat a front runner. 
- Maybe. I think that for a lot of the candidates on that stage with Joe Biden, the reason why the conventional thinking was that it's a good thing to share the debate stage with him is because obviously, a lot of eyes are looking at him. When you're coming into this race as Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders, you have a high name recognition. So that's why I think in a lot of these early polls, you're seeing them so far out ahead. They have leads now to defend. For the other candidates, it's a matter of introducing themselves to an electorate that may not be aware of all these other candidates that are in the race now. And so when you see these polls tightening, I actually don't know that it's rising levels of support and not support. I actually think it's just the electorate tuning in and showing that they're becoming aware of different people. I think that as we get further down the line, we're gonna see a debate in July, a debate in September, that's when we're gonna start to see a lot more of the awareness coming into the polls. After that, I'd feel comfortable looking at polls and saying, all right, these are trends that are sticking. 
- Yeah, this is for us right now, people who watch this all the time as opposed to the public. 
- Exactly. 
- Okay, my executive producer informs me you're Ali Vitali. I'm Ali Velshi. 
- I've heard that, yeah. 
- This was the Ali V segment. Good to see you, my friend. 
- You too. 
- Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will pause their fight, by the way, over past education policy to talk about the current state of America's public schools. They're scheduled to join eight other Democratic presidential candidates at the National Education Association's Strong Public Schools Presidential Forum in Houston. The contenders will answer questions from classroom teachers and other educational professionals. MSNBC's Mariana Atencio joins us now from Houston. The forum is going to begin at the top of the hour. Mariana, some of the candidates have outlined plans to improve the education system, and you've had a chance to talk with educators who are at the event. What are they looking for? What are the attendees looking for from the presidential candidates? 
- Ali, educators want to know from the candidates how they plan to increase teacher pay, first of all. We've seen teachers, for the most part, rally and strike across the country for increased teacher pay, but also how the candidates are going to increase funding for education, how they're gonna make educators stay in the classroom. Many teachers here tell me they have to work two, three jobs just to be an educator, and they're having to put their own money toward buying textbooks and school supplies. So how these candidates are gonna improve conditions in classrooms. But it also goes beyond education. I spoke to one teacher named Christina from Denver, Colorado who tells me she has a classroom of mixed status kids, a lot of Latino families. So she's also interested to know about the candidates' immigration proposals, because whatever they do on immigration will inevitably affect the kids in her classroom. And then finally, what you were talking about with Ali V. A lot of chatter here about that contested exchange over race between Biden and Harris. A lot of educators also wanna see what both of them will talk about regarding that at the forum today. Ali? 
- I appreciate that. Thank you, my friend, Mariana Atencio. We're gonna check in with you a little bit later. And a quick programming note. In the next hour, I'm gonna be talking live to Senator Amy Klobuchar. She's one of the 2020 contenders who is attending today's forum in Houston. We are going to talk about her public education policies. That is three p.m. Eastern right here on MSNBC. All right, the President says ICE agents will soon begin a nationwide roundup of undocumented immigrants and claim border facilities are clean, fine and only overcrowded because of Democrats. Texas Democratic Congressman Marc Veasey, who toured border facilities, detention facilities this week, joins me next. You're watching MSNBC.

- [Announcer] With a mattress at Casper.com. 
- Well, don't call them raids. I say they came in illegally, and we're bringing them out legally. These are people where we have the papers, we've gone through the court system. They'll be starting fairly soon, but I don't call 'em raids. Thousands and thousands of people will be legally removed from the country, and that process has started. And we've actually been doing that for a long time. 
- President Trump announced he'd be carrying out his initiative to round up and mass deport thousands of undocumented migrants back to their home countries fairly soon. This comes almost two weeks after he called of threatened raids to, see if the Democrats and Republicans can get together and work out a solution to the asylum and loophole problems at the southern border. But a week later at the G20 summit, he said immigration raids would likely take place sometime after the July 4th holiday. It comes just as more reports reveal that the administration has been sending heft fines of up to nearly $500,000 to migrants who seek refuge in places of warship. Joining me now is Democratic representative from Texas, Marc Veasey, who traveled to El Paso to visit several detention facilities in the area. Congressman, good to see you. Thank you for being with us. 
- Ali. 
- The President has implied that what congressmen are seeing, either they're being dishonest about it or they're not actually seeing. What have you seen? And how does that compare to what other congressmen have told us, other members of Congress have told us, and our own reporters have seen about overcrowding, and the shortage of food and blankest and things like that? 
- Right, exactly. Well, I was on the trip to El Paso several days ago, and we visited one of the detention centers there that was under a lot of scrutiny. And what we saw was at least one holding cell that was crowded. And they had Cuban migrants that were placed in this particular cell, and they told us the reason why they were in such an overcrowded cell was because the Cubans didn't mix well with the other people from Latin American countries. So they wanted to keep them together in that cell. They were crying. They were sad. One grandmother told a story of her mentally impaired grandson being separated from her. And they did tell members of the delegation that when they asked for water, that they were told to drink out of the toilet. Now, you know, I have to tell you, based on this Facebook page that came out, and that story actually broke while we were on our trip to El Paso, I believe that the Border Patrol agents did tell them that. I absolutely believe that they've been mean to this people-
- 
- Tell me the connection between the two, because you know that there are almost 10,000 people on this Facebook page in which it has Customs and Border Protection employees and officers saying disparaging, sexist, racist, misogynistic things about both members of Congress, and migrants, asylum seekers, even people crossing the river. 
- Right, yes. I think it's a broader part of the culture there. Now, it's actually broken that they have actually known about this page perhaps for up to three years, and they were not surprised about this. When we got there and we talked with the Customs and Border Patrol people that were in charge of our tour, they told us, Oh, my god, we've never heard of this. But come on, three years? If that's true, then that means that we were lied to, that members of Congress where lied to on the trip about this page. And again, the fact that they would be mean to people and that there were kids that were in overcrowded conditions that were walking around with mucus-filled shirts, stories that were told to us, stories that, in my opinion, were backed up the the IG's report, and even the acting Homeland Secretary said that the conditions there are not good, I mean, everything that I've heard from the migrants while I was there on my trip, I 100% believe. 
- Congressman, the President talked about it this morning. He says members of Congress are attacking Border Patrol. Let's listen. 
- I've seen some of those places, and they are run beautifully. They're clean. They're good. They do a great job. They do a great job. They're crowded because the Democrats will not give us any relief from these loopholes. We have loopholes that are so bad, we have asylum that's so bad. I think that the Border Patrol has been treated very, very badly by certain members of Congress, very, very badly. For the most part, they're very respected by Congress, but certain members of Congress say very bad things and lie and exaggerate. 
- So what do you have to say about that, Congressman? He's saying that certain members of Congress lie and exaggerate. But in fact, this Border Patrol stuff wasn't actually reported by members of Congress. It was reported by somebody in that group who linked it to ProPublica. 
- Yeah, that is absolutely right. And you know, the President has never seen a lie that he didn't like. And right now, he's just spinning. He's playing politics like he's been playing politics with these migrants. And absolutely, Ali, everything that I've heard about and everything that the President has, you know, he's trying to almost like pit the Border Patrol agents and try to make this a political issue. But I will tell you that there was another Border Patrol agent, you may have saw the interview, and he even backed up the deplorable conditions in which the migrants were living in. And so I don't see this as an issue of Democrats versus Border Patrol agents. I think that there are some agents there that feel like, that they are empowered to do anything that they wanna do because of the direction that they get from the executive branch, from the statements that come out of the President's mouth, from the actions that come out of the President's immigration policy people like Stephen Miller. I think that that sort of culture has been allowed to exist there. But I, by no means, think that every Border Patrol agent is a bad person. We even heard from lawyers and other people, before we began our tour in El Paso, that wanted to let us know that some of these Border Patrol agents are members of the community in good standing. We work with them, that they were part of their families, and that they certainly did not paint them with a broad brush. And I'm not trying to do that right now. I'm saying that they have a problem there and it needs to be rooted out. And I'm very happy that Elijah Cummings is going to hold a hearing on oversight and investigation so we can look into some of these allegations. Not just with the Facebook page, with the overcrowding conditions. Congressman, good to talk to you. Thank you for taking time to discuss with us, Representative Marc Veasey of Texas.

- Iran has threatened to seize a British oil tanker after authorities in Gibraltar detained an Iranian oil tanker on Thursday. The British say the ship breached European Union sanctions by carrying a shipment of crude oil to Syria. Iranian authorities believe the British were acting on intelligence from the United States when they seized the ship. The latest incident comes as Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said that his country will begin enriching Uranium as early as Sunday to a level that would exceed the limits specified under the 2015 Nuclear Accord. Let's bring in NBC's Tehran Bureau Chief, Ali Arouzi live from Tehran. Ali, this is a tricky one because much of the Syrian regime despised around the world and even in the region is supported by the Iranians, so it would be logical, to some people, to think that Iran is supplying oil to Syria. What do we know about what happened here? 
- Well, Ali, what we know is that this was the (mumbles) that Iran says that they earned. And it was taking crude oil to Syria, but it was taking a very curious route to Syria. Instead of going through the Suez Canal, which would be a massive shortcut for this supertanker to take, it went around the tip of Africa, all the way up towards the Mediterranean coast of Syria, where it was seized in Gibraltar by British Marines. Now, it's very odd that it would take this route. Now some people are saying that this may have been a smokescreen by the Iranians to disguise its route because it's not allowed to take oil to Syria because of EU sanctions. And the British were tipped off by the United States that this cargo was heading to Syria, and some 30 British Marines then boarded the ship. They boarded it by ropes coming down on helicopters, while others came on speedboats. And now, the ship is being held in Gibraltar waters. The crew of the ship are being questioned. It's not clear whether they're being questioned on land or on the sea. And incidentally, most of the crew are Pakistanis and Indians, not Iranians. They're not being treated as criminals but rather as witnesses. Now, the authorities in Gibraltar have said that they are gonna keep the ship for another two weeks until the investigation comes to an end, but Iran is obviously up in arms. They are saying that this is an act of piracy by the British, and an Iranian commander, revolutionary guard commander is saying that a British oil tanker should be seized in retaliation. 
- All right, Ali Arouzi, thank you so much, NBC News Tehran Bureau Chief Ali Arouzi. The situation with Iran is just one of several foreign policy crises that President Trump is dealing with. The President is also trying to reach an agreement with China to end his trade war and a deal with North Korea to curb its nuclear program. While Democrats and some Republicans have criticized the President's handling of foreign policy issues, his core supporters still appear to be onboard with his efforts. Joining us to take a closer look at this is Henry Olsen. Henry is a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center. He's also an opinion columnist for The Washington Post, and he wrote a column on this issue that was published last week. Henry, good to see you. Thank you for being with us. 
- Thanks for having me on. 
- Henry, I wanna read a little bit from this column that you published in which you say about Donald Trump, His fans, not surprisingly, take a different view. Most don't subscribe to the Trump as Superman fantasy. Instead, they recognize that experts have been in charge of US foreign policy for decades and, they argue, we have little to show for it. North Korea has nuclear weapons. China has emerged as a dangerous geopolitical foe. In their view, Trump's dramatic breaks with the past could be the only chance the United States has to avert dangerous conflicts with one or both nations. Better to take a chance on him, they reason, than hope more of the same will yield different results. I think that's a remarkably sophisticated view of what might be happening. Do you think that Donald Trump's base holds that view of how he handles foreign affairs? 
- I think the President's base is very supportive of him. They think he has America's best interests at heart. They think that he's not going to be somebody who sends American boys and girls to die for an ally's interest, that's not immediately in America's interest. And I think they are willing to take some pain or take some risks in order to confront Chian and North Korea. The polls have shown for years that being critical towards China is a winner, particularly in the Midwest and particularly with eh people who moved from Democratic to Republican to support President Trump. So I think they're supportive of him, and I think they're willing to give him a lot of rope and give them a lot of opportunities to show that he's doing the right thing. 
- So in both of these cases, a lot of rope has been been ceded, in fact. In China, we've been reporting on farmers who are suffering because their crop prices are low. They've been getting some reimbursements from the government. But every last farmer we talked to says, I'd rather have money from my crops. Yet, you're right. When we talked to them, they say, We're still sticking by the President. When does that run out, that goodwill? 
- Well, I think it may not run out very quickly. I think you've got people who recognize that this has been a long time coming. China ceded to the WTO almost 20 years ago. Millions of people have lost their jobs, according to MIT and University of San Diego economists, because of Chinese import competition. And the fact that some farmers are losing money, they can look around and see that their neighbors lost a lot more than they did. So I think that as long as the President is firm and as long as the President is consistent, that the rope they give him may be extended for quite a while longer. 
- I mean, these farmers live on a razor's edge of margins. Are you saying that it might be another year or two that they'll stick by the President? 
- I think it depends. It depends on what the President does. But the thing to remember is that the farmers receive a lot of government support. They receive revenue support, the soybean farmers in particular and corn farmers are able to buy into a government-financed insurance program that guarantees their revenues. Plus they have a price support program. Plus they have a disaster program. This is a group that may prefer to sell to steady markets but they have a lot of support from the government, plus the temporary support that the President has been adding to see them through over the next couple of years. 
- Henry, good to talk to you. We'll continue this conversation another time. We appreciate it. 
- Thank you. 
- Henry Olsen is Vice President and Director at the National Research Initiative. All right, today, good news from the monthly jobs report. 200,000 jobs were added, further proof our economy is strong. But why doesn't it seem to be working for everyone? That is the big question.

- The United States is in its longest period of economic expansion on record, but there is a widening gap between the richest Americans and everyone else. Now much of that has to do with wealth and the ability for the middle class of America to attain it. Let's just discuss what this is. Wealth are your assets. I think everybody knows this, your home, your durable goods like your TVs, your refrigerators, any stocks you own, pension plans, if you own a business. All that minus your liabilities, things like your mortgage, credit card debt, car payments, things like that, that's your wealth, your assets minus your liabilities, your balance sheet. More than a third of gains in household wealth went to the wealthiest 1% over the past decade. This actually goes all the way to 1989. And you can see the top 1% here and the bottom 50% here were in unison until the mid '90s. Remember, that's when China joined the World Trade Organization. We started buying more stuff from them. Globalization and technology took hold. And you start to see what that did. The top 1% ended up with these gains. The chart shows the fourth quarter total net worth of the top 1% of wealth holders and the bottom 50%. These figures, by the way, are in millions of dollars. As you can see, the bottom 50% barely, barely making any gains at all. In fact, for a little while here in the 2000s, they were making negative gains. They were losing wealth. Okay, what's causing this dramatic disparity? The Associated Press analyzed that few middle class owners or fewer middle class Americans are owning homes. The price gains if you own a home has made home ownership less feasible for new buyers. So if you had a home, you've done well. If you didn't have a home, the prices have made it hard to get in. But then the recession occurred and nearly eight million Americans lost their homes. Since then, prices have again risen dramatically in places like wealthy metro areas, especially along the coast. In 2004, middle class home ownership rates stood at about 70%. In 2016, we're now at about 60%. So that's one area of wealth. There's also the issue of low participation in the stock market. We talk a lot about the stock market. The President talks a lot about the stock market. But the proportion of middle income household that own shares has actually declined. In 2007, 56% of middle class Americans owned shares. And by the way, in 2016, that dropped to 50%. This decline is attributed to more middle income workers taking jobs that don't have retirement savings plans, as well as expenses like healthcare and student loan debt which are taking those bills, that money that would have gone to investment. Now compare that investment rate to the top 10%. Almost everybody in the top 10% owns stock. In 2007, the number was 93%. It is up to 95% in 2016. So this is wealth disparity. Joining me now is Washington Post economics correspondent Heather Long. Her recent op ed speaks directly to this issue. And Heather, the simple question here is that in shorthand, if Martians came down to Earth and said, How is your economy doing, the short answer would have to be good. And only if they ask a second question would you be able to say, But it is really not evenly distributed. 
- I think you're right. As I traveled the country, that's exactly what I hear. Americans will tell you that this is definitely a better economy than it was in 2008, in '09 during the great recession, but the next but out of their mouths is they still feel a lot of anxiety. And in our story today, we call it 40% of Americans are still struggling to pay their bills which seems like a very unusually high statistic in a moment when we have such a low employment rate, and the President keeps talking about a blue collar jobs boom. So why do we still have this bottom 40% that's still hurting so much. And there's really two parts to it. You just walkED through the wealth so well people don't have as much of a cushion as they did before. We have half the population that has still not recovered the level of wealth that they had just before the great recession. So they still don't have as much of a cushion as what they would like to have in a normal time, let alone heading into any potential downturn. 
- And we know that statistically, but in your piece, you actually wrote about that very specifically. I'm reading from your piece. It says, In discussions with 30 Americans unable to pay all of their bills, a clear pattern emerged. Most were able to eke by until they faced an unexpected crisis, such as a job loss, cancer, car trouble, or storm damage. Or in the case of this year, we saw with government employees who were furloughed or when the government shut down. These are middle income workers. These are not poor Americans. But some setback will set them off, and that means they are constantly living with a level of anxiety which will cause them to say, I'm not sure whose great economy you're talking about because I'm scared every month. 
- Yeah, that's exactly right. I think what we've really learned in the last decade about people who are in the working class is how volatile their situations are. There's a lot less certainty around the hours you're going to work and how much you're going to make during those hours. Retail workers have talked a lot about how frustrated they are about not knowing their schedule week to week. And on the flip side is that people not having that cushion anymore, they haven't been able to save. They haven't been able, after losing homes, to get back on that housing or stock market, to build back up their savings and their assets to weather a rainy day situation. It's pretty stunning. I think the Kaiser Foundation group that studies healthcare had a pretty incredible statistic. It's something like one in six Americans, even if they have health insurance, will face an unexpectedly large bill that they hadn't planned for every year. 
- Heather, good to talk to you. Thank you for the story that you've written. We'll continue to have this conversation, because I think it's the most important economic conversation of our time. Heather Long is a Washington Post economics correspondent.

- All right, it looks like the longest economic expansion in US history is going to continue at least for the time being. The Labor Department reported today that hiring rebounded in June with employers adding 224,000 new jobs last month. That's up from just 72,000 in May, which was a not very good number. The unemployment rate ticked up to 3.7%. That's a sign that more people are returning to the workforce. And average hourly earnings were up just over 3% year over year. President Trump hailed the news as he left the White House to spend the weekend at his New Jersey golf club. 
- We had great numbers this morning. I think it was 224,000 jobs. Those were really unexpectedly good. And our country continues to do really well, really, really well, so we're very happy about it. 
- President Trump may be happy about the news. The markets don't seem to care as much. Taking a look at the big board, we have now at least moved to the point where we're kind of flat. The problem here, of course, is that a strong jobs number means that the Fed may not lower interest rates, which is something the Fed doesn't really seem to wanna do, but the President really, really wants the Fed to do. And that's why that's troubling investors a little bit. But again, it's a holiday trading day. I wouldn't put too much stock into anything you see in the market. We've got mixed performance. We've got the NASDAQ up, and the Dow and the S&P down. Let's take a closer look at this with Michael Strain. He's the director of economic policy studies and a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. We would call him a conservative economist. Michael, good to see you, my friend. This is a tricky situation for the President because he loves a strong stock market and he loves low job numbers, and he's got both at the moment but he wants the Fed to lower interest rates. Is that something that that just gives the Fed pause? 
- Yeah, I think it does give the Fed pause. I think that there's generally been a lot of hype about the path of interest rates among commentators and on Wall Street. Before today's job numbers, you know, talk of a 50-basis-point cut or something like that. I think the Fed, well, a lot of the concern about the slowness of the economy was based on what we saw in last month's job number, when it was reported that the economy added 75,000 jobs. People were concerned that that was a market turning point, that the economy was slowing, and perhaps slowing rapidly, and the Fed needed to get out ahead of the economy and kind of cushion the blow. Today, we see a totally different story. And I think people overreacted to last month's news. It's important not to overreact to this month's news. What I think we're seeing is an economy adding about 150 to 180,000 jobs a month, slower than in 2018 but still solid and still steady. 
- You wrote an oped for The Guardian newspaper in which you talked about how with the economy being in as good a shape as the data suggests, it's a strange time to debate whether capitalism is broken. And I think you and I have had this conversation before. It's a conversation I just had with Heather Long. The remarkable wealth inequality in the United States and basically around the world is what's making people say, Hey, I see the stock market going up all the time. I see home prices going up all the time. I see the strong economy, but my wages, particularly for some. Maybe it's about a third of Americans, they feel left out of this whole thing. About a similar percentage of people in the United Kingdom feel left out of it, people in France, people in Germany. The Arab Spring started with something very similar where people said, I'm doing what society said I was supposed to do, and I'm not partaking of the fruits of this remarkable economic growth. 
- Yeah, you know, as I look into the numbers more and more, I'm less and less convinced that inequality is actually the story here. If you look from say 1980 until the great recession, you see a significant increase in inequality. If you look over the last 10 years, inequality growth has actually flattened, and it may have even declined depending on which income measure you're interested in. At the same time as inequality was soaring during the 1990s, people weren't concerned about inequality. So I think people actually care about how they're doing and-
- 
- Right, right, right. So in the '90s, so one of the differences was if everybody's sort of going up at a level, in hindsight, when we see those numbers, I don't know if my control room has the same numbers that I put up with Heather Long. If you see over, since the '80s and the '90s, when you've got relative, a flatness and sometimes even decline amongst the bottom 50%, that doesn't feel like you're doing better. 
- Yeah, that's right. And when we had this massive crisis, this serious recession, and then we had a recovery that was slow, that's typical following recessions as severe as this one. But for years and years and years, we had slow and non-accelerating wage growth. 
- [Ali] Right. 
- And over the last few years, that's changed, thank goodness. And my sense is that if we have a long enough period where wages for typical workers are growing at a decent clip, that some of this concern that we're seeing will die down. 
- I hear your argument. Are you worried that given how long we're into this expansion that just by natural causes, it will slow down and we won't get that continued wage growth? Because it's only really since about 2015 that we've seen a nice bump. We've seen some of that extra capacity in the labor market go away and people are actually getting raises. 
- Yeah, I am worried about that, and that actually ties in nicely with what we learned this morning. You know, again, a solid month. But it seems clear that 2019 is going to be a slower year for the labor market than 2018. You know, one of the reasons is because we're just running out of workers to bring in off the sidelines. We saw the labor force participation rate tick up this month, that's fantastic, but there's really only so high that it can go. There are only so many workers we can bring back in. And at some point, we are gonna have another recession. And so I think, you know, the question is a good one. How long can we keep solid wage gains going? And if the answer is not that much longer, then what does that do to kind of politics, and what does that do to popular sentiment? I think that's an important question we're facing. 
- Michael, I always enjoy talking to you. Thank you for taking time for us today. Michael Strain is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. And once again, it remains unclear if the 2020 census will include a citizenship question. Just the last hour, Justice Department lawyers told a federal court in Maryland that they will continue to look for ways to get the question on the census despite an unfavorable ruling from the Supreme Court. And the President reaffirmed his commitment to including the question on the census earlier today maybe by using an executive order. 
- I just spoke with the Attorney General. We have a number of different avenues. We can use all of them or one. We're doing very well on that issue. We're spending $15 to $20 billion on a census. We're doing everything. We're finding out everything about everybody. Think of it. $15 to $20 billion and you're not allowed to ask 'em, Are you a citizen? And by the way, if you look at the history of our country, it's almost always been asked. We're fighting very hard against a system that's a very difficult system, but we'll make a decision. 
- Joining me now is NBC News justice correspondent, Pete Williams. Well, that was a moment of self-awareness for the President and he say we're fighting in a system, and it's a very difficult system. It is complex, and it is difficult. The President can't actually just say, Put the question on now. 
- Well, he can, but whether that will make a difference remains to be seen. I think at this point, anything the administration does from hereon is going to invite litigation, and the Justice Department admitted as such or conceded the point today in its filing. This is in Maryland. This is a separate case. This is not the one that went to the Supreme Court. It's one that is still going on and which challengers say adding this question would be unfair discrimination and violating the equal protection clause of the Constitution. And what the government says in the filing before that judge is that they've been asked to reevaluate all available options that would allow for putting this question back on the census form. No great surprise there given what the President had said this morning. But they do say that if, for example, Commerce Secretary Ross comes up with a new explanation for wanting to put this question on the form, then the plaintiffs, the people who have challenged that, would be fully entitled to challenge the decision at that time. So they can see that almost anything they do at this point will be producing a new lawsuit. And of course, the issue there is it puts additional pressure on the Census Bureau. The longer these lawsuits play out in court, the less time the Census Bureau has to get these forms printed. And this letter does say despite all of this back and forth, no census forms are being printed now that have the citizenship question on them. They say they are currently enjoined by all these court rulings from putting the census questionnaire, printing, rather, the census questionnaire that includes the citizenship question. So they're still trying to find some way to do it, but just about anything they try to do is undoubtedly gonna produce another lawsuit, more litigation and more delay. 
- For time and logistics purposes, under what constraints is the Census Bureau operating? In other words, the President talked about delaying the census. Is that another court case? Or can the President actually do that? 
- Ah, well, two things. When he talked about delaying the census, my sense is that he didn't really mean putting off when the doors get knocked on and when people fill out the form. Traditionally, the census has been a snapshot of who's where on April 1st of every year that ends in a zero. And I can't imagine that that will be delayed. What I suspect he was talking about is getting the forms printed. But the government has said we have to start printing these things July 1st, and indeed, they did, to get them all done in time. It raises the question though, if they hae to start over, if they somehow prevail and are able to add this question, could they trash all the stuff they printed so far and start over? Will they have enough time? And I guess the answer is if they had enough money, yes. They just get more printers involved and could probably get it done. I'm just not sure where that money comes from, whether they would have to go back to Congress, and that would add another bit of delay here. 
- Pete Williams, never been stumped by a complicated question. We appreciate it, my friend. 
- Or pretend not to be. 
- NBC News justice correspondent, our good friend, Pete Williams. With me now, Washington Post opinion writer, Jennifer Rubin. She's also an MSNBC political contributor, and she's a Conservative. And she writes in a new headline, Census: A flat-out win for progressives, the courts and America. Tell me about that, Jennifer. Why do you add progressives in that title? Why do you think it's a win for progressives? 
- I think it's a win for everyone. I think the progressive groups that were litigating this, groups like the ACLU, were making the very cogent argument that the President was including this question as a way of deterring people who might be afraid to give out their information or the information of people living with them regarding their immigrant status and that this is actually contrary to law. It's been decided a while back that the census is supposed to be capturing everybody. And by including this question, you're purposefully diminishing the count in areas that there probably are gonna be some blue representatives, urban areas, for example. So I think for them, this was a legal victory at the Supreme Court. And now, the President is kind of playing with words, and the poor Justice Department lawyers are having to go into court to make themselves look awfully foolish. Understand what they've said. They've said, Well, we don't have the real reason. We don't have the real non (mumbles) reason yet, but give us a few weeks and we'll come up with a real reason. This is absurd. They're obviously just looking for another lie. And to make matters worse, the Maryland case is the case in which some new evidence has come to light, and this is damning for the administration. Apparently, a computer file was discovered by the daughter of a gentleman who is designing this in order to benefit the Republican party, by over counting, or if you will, tipping the scales toward the white population. This is completely illegal. This is exactly what the plaintiffs have been fearing. And if they wanna go forward, the plaintiffs are saying, Well, yes, let's go forward. Let's cover all this new information. The government filing today unbelievably said, Give us some more time to think of a reason but don't let them look at the discovery in front of them. 
- When you look at the concept of a census, it's in the Old Testament, right? 
- Right. 
- I mean, it has been historically understood that if you don't count properly, you mess up on the provision of services to your country. Should this even be partisan? Should this be a progressive win? Shouldn't we just all agree? And you know, sometimes it's gonna benefit Conservatives, and sometimes it's gonna benefit progressives, but shouldn't we just all be counting properly and not be debating this? 
- We should, but unfortunately, the President has made it partisan. He is determined not to count everybody or to set up a question that is designed to make a count really inaccurate. He's the only President that has done this. He's the only President who has taken objectively neutral things that shouldn't be a matter of non-partisanship-
- 
- [Ali] Right, counting how many people are in your country-
- 
- Whether it's the Fourth of July or accounting. 
- Counting how many people we are should be objectively neutral. 
- It should be, but not under this president. And he was the one who came up with the idea. The Secretary of Commerce was the one who came up with a false reason. The Chief Justice was very nice not calling him a liar, but he essentially said the reason doesn't match the facts. That's lying in my book. But he sent them back to figure this whole thing out, I think hoping that it wouldn't come back. I suspect if it ever comes back to the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court will have used up their patience on this and will swat it away again. 
- What a remarkable, I mean, of all the things I didn't think I'd actually be disgusting as a journalist, this is just one more to pile on to the top. Jennifer, good to see you as always. Thank you for joining us. 
- You too.

- The parades, picnics and other July 4th events are over, and the Democratic presidential candidates have returned to serious policy discussions. Today, a number of them are talking about education. 10 Democratic contenders are taking part in the National Education Association's Strong Public Schools Presidential Forum taking place right now in Houston. Bernie Sanders, you can see up there on the stage. One of the candidates participating in today's event is Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar whose mother was a second grade teacher. A short time ago, she unveiled a new proposal called progress partnerships, a federal state effort to provide additional resources and funding for public schools. In order to take part, states will need to do or have already done the following things. With regard to teacher pay, states will agree to a state federal partnership that includes generous federal matches to increase salaries for all teachers. States will also have to work with educators to develop and submit recommendations on how schools can meet the needs of working families like after-school programs, alternative programs and community schools. The plan also calls for generous federal funding to improve school infrastructure. States will also have to create a mechanism for distributing those funds that make sure to address disparities in conditions and resources and provide equal funding for districts across the state. And states will also need to convene a commission to review their existing education funding formula to ensure that all students, particularly those with the greatest needs, have access to adequate educational resources. Senator Klobuchar joins me now from the NEA conference in Houston. She is a contender for the presidency in 2020. Senator, good to see you again. Thank you for being with us. 
- Well, thanks, Ali. Thanks for mentioning my mom. She would have loved to be here today. She taught second grade until she was 70 years old. 
- [Ali] Wow. 
- And I still have people come up to me and say she was their favorite teacher. Her favorite unit she taught was the monarch butterfly one where she would dress up as a butterfly with antennas, tights, and carry a sign that said to Mexico or bust. 
- [Ali] That is amazing. 
- [Amy] Because that's where the monarch butterflies flew. 
- [Ali] We've got a picture of her on the screen, actually. 
- She was an incredible teacher. And there she is, yes. And she actually, she was the teacher of the year for her district a number of times. And one of the things that she thought very strongly about was that all kids, which I have now inherited, all kids deserve a right to a good education. And that's why I went to public school. My daughter went to public schools, including a number of years in a school that was nearly 90% free and reduced lunch. So I have a sense of what's going on there, and I can tell you right now, there should be more federal investment and more focus on education. If we wanna participate in this global economy, our kids have to be able to do a good job. And to do a good job, you need good teachers. And to recruit good teachers, you need to have good pay, and you need to make sure that the kids are getting prepared for the jobs we have available today. 
- So we have 330 million in the United States, roughly. We have 50 million public school students in 2017. And fundamentally, the responsibility for educating those students falls to the states. So while I'm deeply appreciative of the thought that goes into plans like yours and the other candidates, states, in general, have been underfunding, very deliberately underfunding public education for decades now. We have created a world in which people like your mother are not treated the way they should be in terms of the respect and the pay they should be given. Teachers now, public school teachers who may earn whatever they earn are often taking money out of their own pockets to buy supplies for their schools. How do you shift that conversation? 
- Exactly, my mom did that. 
- Because the federal government can't take all that responsibility. 
- My mom did that. Okay, so the federal government is spending like 3% of education costs, and you should move that up. And let me tell you, exactly what you said is why I put these progress partnerships forward. I think you need to incentivize the states to do more, especially when it comes to teacher pay and infrastructure, those things. And you do it with generous matching grants and to make sure they're headed in the right direction. The second thing, and this is a plan a number of us have put forward, Kamala Harris, others, about increasing teacher pay. And one of the ways you can do this is by paying for it with going back to the numbers on the estate tax that we had during the Obama administration or somewhere around that. And that would literally raise enough money to substantially increase teacher pay. We're talking here about that estate tax exemption. That would be something that would be really helpful to recruiting, and that's federal money, right? Then you have ideas like mine which is to incentivize states to be focusing more on teachers and our schools and making sure that we have more quality in our schools. That's the way you do it. 
- So we have two different issues that we're dealing with. One is teacher pay. And I just wanna show our views. According to the National Education Association hosting the event you're at, the highest teacher salaries are in New York, California and Massachusetts, upward of $80,000 a year. The lowest, in Mississippi, West Virginia and Oklahoma, in the 40s. So we've got that problem that you and I discussed, and then we've got this other issue, and that is states with the highest and lowest average spending per capital on students. Again, New York, Washington state and New Jersey spent upward of $20,000 per pupil. Idaho, Utah and Arizona are spending six, seven and $8,000 per pupil. We're not even, we're nowhere close to having a standardized level of education if you Look at it through funding in this country. 
- Right, and so that is why, right, and so that is why upping the federal role, putting in an Education Secretary who is not Betsy DeVos, making sure that we have policymakers in place that understand what education means and how important it is for individual families but also for the future of our country when we're trying to compete in a global economy. And then I think one really interesting issue was apprenticeships and doing more with community colleges at the high school level. So that's a lot about what we are gonna be talking about today. And I can tell you, school, college, those are things that people brought to bring in the parades and things that I did the last few days. I think I'm the only candidate that went, the last three days, I've been in Iowa, New Hampshire and Houston. People bring up school a lot. That is core to their families. And as someone that didn't come from money, that stands here today as a candidate for president after being the granddaughter of an iron ore miner who couldn't finish high school so he could raise his family, and the daughter of a teacher and a newspaper man, I can speak, walk the walk when it comes to the importance of education, and that's what I'm going to be talking about today on that stage. 
- Senator, one of the other topics that we cover very closely on this show is the issue of data privacy and management with Facebook. Roger McNamee, who's a great friend of our show, talks very fondly of the fact that you, you don't get a lot of press for this, but you put a lot of thinking into how to deal with Silicon Valley and tech. Give us a bit of your idea about how you deal with the very pressing and almost daily concerns that we're hearing about how these companies operate and manage our information. 
- I think they thought they could just run the tables and no one would care because they're successful companies. I don't like to take success away from them. That's great. But the point is we need a counterbalance here. And the first thing we need is privacy rules in place. And they've been able to say, Hey, we're just a forum. No, they're not. They are media companies. They've made tons of money off of individuals' information. So that's why this idea of putting privacy rules in place at one of the few bipartisan bills out there to do it, with getting notice of data breaches and making sure that there are rules in place so people can protect their private data is first. You also have to make sure that when they're sharing data, that there's rules about that. And I would suggest that they have to pay a fee, a tax so that money can go back into our nation's cybersecurity to protect us. And the third thing is all about democracy. If we don't do something about this before the next election, when we have a president sending out doctored videos of Speaker Pelosi, she's strong, she's gonna be able to protect herself, but if this is what our campaigns are gonna come to, videos where you can't even tell if it's the person or not, we have a major problem. So making those companies put some rules of the road in place when it comes to who's buying ads, who is paying for those ads, what those ads are so other campaigns and the media can see them is gonna be critical. Why should your network have to follow those rules and then these other billion-dollar companies don't? It makes no sense at all. And as we know from 2016, it played a major role in spreading fake news and also allowing, basically, for foreign countries to have influence on our election. And when I heard the President make a joke about meddling when he was at the G20, that's just what we're dealing with right now. We're in July 4th week. We know that millions of people sacrificed, serving our country. Hundreds and thousands of them are dying serving our country. That's what's happened, and yet, he makes a joke about it. It's not a joke, not to those who have served to protect our freedom. 
- Senator, I wanna ask you one last question. You're from Minnesota, and you are on the Agriculture Committee. Just in the last hour, I spoke to a Conservative economist who said that while farmers are suffering, particularly for the price of their corn or soybeans because of the trade war, the amount of subsidy they get from the federal government allows them to justify continuing to support the President in these trade wars. What's your take on that? 
- My take is that the farmers I know, they just wanna make a living. And they know very well, the more their soybeans sit at their farms or they are unable to sell goods to market, the more those contracts are going to farmers in other countries and foreign lands, and it's gonna be harder and harder. They can't just get those contracts back in a month so their long-term viability, we have had more and more farm bankruptcies, especially for the small farmers. So my focus as a senior member of the Agriculture Committee and my focus as president will be to make sure that we keep our food supply in America. We do that with a special focus on our small farmers. I have a very strong track record of making sure these payments aren't going to the Beverly Hills 90210 area code, that they're going instead to our small farmers, and then making sure that if we're gonna push on trade, which we should do, that we're not using a meat cleaver like this president has done, or we can call it a tweet cleaver, but instead, we're focused on targeted tariffs and targeted trade policies that are really gonna make a difference. And that's what I'm concerned about that's going on in the Midwest. I'm someone that's won in those red districts, Ali. I have won in 42 of the counties that Trump won in my state. I think that farmers wanna make a decent living, and they want someone that can look them in the eye and tell them the truth. They don't always agree with it, but tell them the truth. That's something that this president really does. 
- Senator Amy Klobuchar, thank you for taking time to talk to us today. 
- It was great to be on. Thank you. 
- Amy Klobuchar, candidate for president, and she's a senator from Minnesota. Still ahead, the President promised to crack down on illegal immigration after the Fourth of July. The holiday's come and gone, and Trump says the raids will start soon. I'll talk to a former head of ICE next.

- I don't call 'em raids. I say they came in illegally, and we are bringing 'em out legally. These are people where we have the papers. We've gone through the court system. They'll be starting fairly soon. But I don't call 'em raids. 
- That was President Trump earlier talking about the ICE raids that he's been promising. The President initially delayed the raids on June 22nd, the day before they were set to begin, saying he'd give Congress two weeks to work on asylum laws and help the flow of migrants at the southern US border. But since then, no comprehensive immigration reform deal has been reached. With me now is the former Acting Director of US Immigrations and Custom Enforcement, John Sanders. John, good to see you again. This is tricky. Whether the President wants to call them raids or not, they are some sort of enforcement action that require some degree of planning, and there were some people, you and I talked about this last time. There were some people who said the President, by continuing to announce these things and talk about them in the media, actually compromises the work that he might be trying to achieve. 
- Yeah, that's absolutely right. Listen, having been involved in a number of these operations and whether you call them raids or whatever you call them, these enforcement actions, the number one rule is you don't tip the target in advance because then, when you go to the house or the location where you think that target is, they're simply not there. When we began these operations, the beginning of the operation, we'd get something like 90% of the people we're going after, but over time, they would dissipate simply because word got out that we were conducting this type of operation, and people fled and hid. 
- President Trump has said that public safety is the reason for these raids, or he's not now calling them raids. But new documents actually show that ICE is building target lists for these mass roundups of people based on target numbers that they have to meet. So the question is do these public documents, you know, these things sort of hurt the argument that there's a public safety need for these raids? 
- Ali, it's not gonna be public safety. Listen, ICE, you know, the problem here is this. The President wants big numbers. 
- [Ali] Yeah. 
- To get big numbers, what that requires, typically, is you go after the most vulnerable population. They're the easiest to find. They're the easiest to get. The criminal alien population is actually the most difficult to find. They're adept at hiding. They're adept at using aliases. It takes a lot more than leg work to get those individuals than it does a family member with children who are sitting in a static location. So look, I don't think this operation, at all, is gonna promote public safety. You could argue that ut helps promote the integrity of our immigration court system or the board of security but certainly not public safety. 
- This other story is the Trump administration is threatening to impose huge fines on people who disobey deportation orders, some of them upwards of $300,000. Talk to me about that. 
- Well, I mean, there are certain situations of the law in which you can impose a fine on an individual. I tell you, collecting it is a different story entirely. You know, I'm not sure exactly how they intend to collect it against the majority of these individuals. It's a bigger problem if some individual later is able to legally enter the United States, but the reality, Ali, is that the overwhelming, the vast, vast majority of people who are deported from this country are never able to legally return to the United States, period. 
- There is wide agreement on certain immigration issues in this country, for instance, on the Dreamers, the DACA kids, overwhelming support for having them stay here because they have to follow rules, they've grown up here, they are either getting an education or working, they can't commit serious crimes. But there are other disagreements about other basic things, and some Democratic candidates have actually talked about decriminalizing the act of illegally entering the United States. Joe Biden has said today that illegal border crossings should not be decriminalized. This is a very interesting place that Democrats are in because a lot of Americans who are sympathetic to immigrants and asylum seekers may not believe that decriminalizing the act of coming into the United States illegally should be part of the equation. 
- Yeah, I agree with the Vice President on this one. Listen, if you come across the border without inspecting, that is a crime. It's a misdemeanor offense for your first offense, so it's not that serious a crime, but it should remain a crime. Look, there is a role for border security, border enforcement. There's a role for immigration enforcement in this country. I take a lot of issue with the manner in which this administration is conducting that. I think it's detrimental to public safety. I think they're spreading out their targets. They're focused on vulnerable populations instead of folks who pose a public safety threat, but I also worry that because of the President's policies that we're now looking at immigration enforcement writ large, and ICE and CBP in particular, as rogue agencies rather than questioning the specific tactics this administration is doing when there is an important role for all of our public safety in the functions that ICE and CBD do everyday. 
- John, does what the President, is what the President is doing, is that playing into the hands of the President himself because he provokes a reaction that causes some Democrats to say let's decriminalize the operation, and then the President can go out and say that sounds like open borders, which he's been accusing Democrats of embracing the whole time? 
- I think that's right, Ali. I think that, you know, look. A lot of the President's chatter really is idle threat, so to speak. For example, on this raid, he's talking about a million people apprehended. ICE has no capacity to arrest anywhere near a million people. At most, an operation like this in a two-week period is gonna get 5,000, and that's probably optimistic. But it does trigger this kind of reaction of this abolish ICE and this other kind of things where people, I think the majority of the public recognizes that ICE plays a critical role in our public safety, and I do think a lot of people, not enough, recognize too that ICE is probably, you know, is a critical player in the counter-terrorism effort. They save more children from exploitation than any other federal agency. They're the leading agency when it comes to stopping, you know, export control, stopping North Korea and Iran from getting sensitive technologies. But you're right, it plays into the hands when you start taking this kind of, I hate to say it, but extremist positions that we need to abolish ICE entirely or get rid of the border patrol simply because of the administration's policies, not necessarily the agencies themselves. 
- John, always a pleasure to talk to you. John Sandweg, former Acting Director of ICE. Coming up next, we're gonna take a look at America's energy revolution.

- All right, we're taking a closer look into a big economic opportunity in the fight against climate change, clean energy. Here's something you may have missed. For the first time, our capacity for creating electricity from renewable energy sources surpassed that for coal. And as the LA Times points out, domestic coal production and use have dropped to their lowest levels in four decades even though the economy is more than twice the size it was 40 years ago. Additionally, more coal-fired power plants have shut down so far during the Trump presidency than through all eight years of the Obama administration. And it may have something to do with the cost. Let me show you a map of the least expensive technologies for generating electricity across the United States by county. Here, you can see how, let me just show you the colors here. The blue is wind. Green is natural gas. The gold is solar. The yellow is also solar. One of them is for utilities that generate electricity. The lighter yellow is for residential use. And the gray, of course, is coal. Take a look at that. Coal represents the smallest proportion. Joining me now is Russell Gold. He's a senior energy reporter for the Wall Street Journal and author of a new book, Superpower: One Man's Quest to Transform American Energy. It's a book that profiles a man named Michael Skelly who began developing wind energy infrastructure in the early 2000s and went on to build the second largest wind power company in the United States. Russell, good to see you again. Thank you for joining us. 
- Thanks for having me. 
- I wanna just read from your book. You were talking about Michael Skelly, and you said he was a departure from an earlier generation of wind farm builders and solar panel enthusiasts who were more interested in creating sustainable energy than sustainable businesses. Kelly wanted to make a profit because profits would attract new investors and money into renewable energy. This has long been the holy grail. If you can make sustainable and renewable profitable, it can replace sort of older fashioned, dirtier energy. 
- Right, and we're seeing that happen right now. I mean, with the map you just brought up, there is a big part of the middle of the country where you can generate wind at a really low cost. The question right now is how fast can that transition happen. How fast can you bring in more renewables at this lower price? 
- And what are the headwinds and what are the tailwinds for people who are trying to bring renewable energy to market faster? 
- Well, tailwinds right now, as we've been talking about, are costs. Renewable energy, wind, and increasingly, solar is the low-cost way to generate electricity. It beats coal. Increasingly, it beats natural gas, and it beats nuclear. The headwinds are, right now, where you can generate renewable energy inexpensively, is the middle of the country, and that's not exactly where the factories are, the people are. So the question is how do you get that electricity from the middle of the country to the coast, and that's one of the challenges that Michael Skelli tackled and I wrote about in my new book, Superpower. There are other headwinds right now, and I would say one of the major headwinds are some of the political and incumbents, electric utilities and electric generators, who don't want this change, because quite frankly, they're very good at generating electricity from coal and from some of the older resources, and they don't wanna make this change because that would mean less opportunity for them. Most people switch on a light and hope that it goes on. They don't think much about the backbone and the infrastructure of where their power comes from. What is required? What are the infrastructure requirements to make a wholesale shift or as much of a shift as we can make into renewables? 
- Well, firs of all, yeah, it's a great question. And first of all, I'm not talking about 100% renewable electricity because once you get above about 80%, it gets really expensive. But we can get up to 70, 80% of our electricity coming from renewable resources at the same prices or perhaps even lower than we are right now. What's required, the big piece of infrastructure that's required is transmission. These are big electricity lines that can move gigawatts of electricity around. Think about it like your interstate highways. What we have right now are a lot of two-lane roads going all over the place. And much like the 1950s, we said, Hey, let's build these interstate highways so we can move people quickly and efficiently from one city to another. That's really what we need to do right now with our transmission.

- He came from a good family. A judge used that excuse to show leniency to a suspect accused of sexual assault and is prompting renewed debate about rape culture in the United States. The case comes from New Jersey, where that judge denied a request to try a 16-year-old teen as an adult. The suspect is accused of raping an intoxicated girl, recording the assault and sending the video to friends with the text when your first time having sex was rape. In New York and New Jersey, prosecutors can request to send a juvenile case to adult court for serious crimes if the accused is 15 years old or older, but the family court judge denied prosecutor's motion, saying the assault wasn't rape and writing, This young man comes from a good family who put him into an excellent school where he was doing extremely well. He also added, He is clearly a candidate for not just college but probably for a good college. His scores for college entry were very high. The state appeals court has already overturned the judge's decision, but the case underscores a fundamental issue in the way this country views rape and sexual assault. To talk about those issues, I turn to Tarana Burke. She is the founder of the Me Too movement. And you have, during the time, this has become such a big and public movement, really approached this with a degree of sophistication that says we are working from a low base of understanding about these things. And what is the best way to get us to understand what sexual violence is all about? 
- Well, this is why the conversation has to shift about what Me Too is because the thing that's glaring to me in this whole case is that there's no conversation about the survivor, there's no conversation about her grades, how her life was changed, what happened to her, how it affected her, and it's focused totally on this perpetrator. And that's what happens a lot because people, what I've realized more so in the last two years is people don't understand the lifecycle of a survivor. They don't understand what sexual violence is or what it does to the people who experience it. And so you have cases like this happen where you have larger narratives that are patriarchal and misogynistic and veer towards what men and boys need and what their lives and livelihoods, how that's affected more so than the people who they victimized. 
- There was the same conversation on college campuses-
- 
- Absolutely. 
- Where we talked about whether boys were being, having their futures ruined because of the way their assaults were being treated. What does success look like for you on these fronts? Because I don't think your view is that everybody who's a perpetrator needs to have all of the books thrown at them-
- 
- No. 
- But we're not listening to the other side. We're not balancing out victim's rights with perpetrator's rights. 
- This is the thing. When Me Too went viral, you had millions of people literally come together and say, My life has been affected by this thing. We've yet to talk about that thing. We've yet to unpack what sexual violence is and what it really looks like in this country. It's not about these high profile cases as much as it is about these kinds of cases. And so what it's gonna take is a shift in the narrative about how we talk about sexual violence and then also how we talk about this movement. This is a movement that's about healing and action. And the healing and action part, a lot of that is based on how we educate people around sexual violence, how we educate people around what survival looks like. When we shift the narrative, we have, when people are more educated about this, these are people who vote, people who make the legislative decisions, they have to understand this differently. It can't come from this sort of pop culture, salacious headline place. It has to come to a place where you really have empathy and understanding for what survival looks like. 
- How do we get there? Because you and I have talked about this before. When the people accused of sexual harassment or assault are not media or not politicians or not CEOs of major companies, has this trickled down to help victims of sexual violence who don't have a name, who are homeless, who are immigrants, who are single mothers, who work on a factory floor? 
- That's our work. That's our work. That's what the Me Too movement is about. We have an organization, and we are part of a large spectrum of people who are doing this work on the ground. I'm appreciative of coming into spaces like this and being able to talk about it on a national front because this is how we change it. People need to understand that this work is happening. It was happening before Me Too went viral and it's continuing to happen. Part of what we do is educate people about what this is. Part of the work that other organizations do, other national organizations, National Women's Law Center and other organizations like that are educating people but we're also galvanizing people. People keep asking, What is the Me Too movement gonna do about X, and I'm trying to say we're all the Me Too movement. You don't put it on one person. 
- [Ali] It's all of our behavior. 
- It's all of us. We all have to be responsive. We all have to be responsible. When something like this happens, we all have to be outraged and push back. Historically, judicial systems and political systems have to catch up to where the people are. The people realize that stuff like this is awful, but we have to push back and raise our voices so that the court systems know and so that the politicians know that we won't stand for it. 
- [Ali] Tarana, we appreciate you coming and helping us get smarter about this and helping our audience. Tarana Burke is the founder of the Me Too movement.
