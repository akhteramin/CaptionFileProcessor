- Let's see, I've got all my Super Bowl snacks. I've got pigs in a blanket, pigs out of blankets, and just blankets. Hey, it's my mutual Instagram friend, Sir Patrick Stewart. Hey thanks for being here. I had no idea you were such a Super Bowl fan. 
- Oh, of course! I love American football. They get to use their hands. Oh, let's get this mother started, yeehaw! Yeah buddy! Give me a beer! 
- Gritty! 
- Gritwold G. Grittington. I hope you don't mind, but I brought a friend. He was just outside now, parking the van. 
- Oh, sorry for the confusion earlier. Shake? 
- Gritty and I go way back. We used to be in the Royal Shakespeare Company together. 
- Oh, sure, Hamlet. 
- No, Gritty played Juliet. I have no idea where the skull came from. 
- Okiedoke. [Music] We'd better get a buzz going [Music] Who would like to shotgun a brewski? 
- [Announcer] Ball in the air, and it's intercepted! 
- One, two-
- Oh, doorbell. Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer? 
- Please Stephen, we're friends. 
- Just call us Chuck and Speaker of the House Nancy. 
- Okay, so what are you guys doing here? 
- We figured your little get together needed us. 
- Why is that? 
- [Both] 'Cause we're the party leaders. 
- Gritty! Well I'm glad you're here. Why don't you come on in? 
- Oh no, there's more trouble in Washington. 
- We gotta go. 
- Oh, okay. 
- Juice it, Nancy! 
- Thanks, thanks for stopping by. Gritty, if that's out of tune. 
- Come on, get in there! Knock his head off! 
- Patrick, this is the halftime show. [Music] I got the moves [Music] 
- I'm aware of that. Snap his femur! 
- What do you wanna do now? 
- Well, I hear there's an all new Late Show. 
- On Sunday? 
- Mhmm. 
- Let's check that out. Huh, that's weird. Where's the host? Oh god! I'm supposed to be there. Captain, beam me up! 
- Stephen, that's not a real thing. 
- It is to me. Gritwold. 
- Gritwold! You have violated the prime directive. Give that back to me. 
- [Announcer] It's The Late Show with Stephen Colbert Super Bowl Edition. Tonight, are you ready for some Late Show? Plus, Stephen welcomes Conan O'Brien. Musical guest James Taylor, and a special appearance by Steve Carell, featuring Jon Batiste and Stay Human. And now, live on tape from the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York City, it's Stephen Colbert! 
- Woo! Hello! Beautiful, please have a seat everybody. Thanks so much. Welcome one and all, ladies and gentlemen to The Late Show. I'm your host, Stephen Colbert. Happy, happy Super Bowl Sunday. It's always an exciting night. It's a great day, it's a great day. It's a great day. It's our one true national holiday. This is the one day, when despite our divisions, Americans come together around their TVs, and for just one beautiful moment don't fast forward through the commercials. 
- On this great Sunday. 
- We all wanna see which talking animal wants to sell us beer. Which celebrity really wanted the money. I've been there, my brothers and sisters. You enjoy that. 
- On this great Sunday. 
- Another annual tradition is the pre-game presidential interview. Goes back to the very first Super Bowl, when Lyndon Johnson made the surprise announcement that he was sending both teams to Vietnam. Yeah. 
- Oh wow. 
- Fun fact, that's how the NFL draft started. 
- Oh my! 
- Last year, last, is this last year? Last year, Trump skipped the interview, but Friday he sat down with Margaret Brennan of CBS's Face the Nation, and he brought the nation a whole lot of face. He started by describing how he believes he's in a good position to declare a national emergency to get his border wall when negotiations with Congress end on February 15th. 
- When you have people dying all over the country because of people like Nancy Pelosi, who don't want to give proper border security for political reasons. She's doing a terrible disservice to our country, and on the 15th we have now set the table beautifully. 
- Not a hopeful sign, 'cause we all know what it looks like when Trump sets the table beautifully. And so, look how, look. Look how beautiful. Look how. The subject turned to sports when Brennan asked if Trump would let a child of his play football. 
- It's very, it's a very tough question and it's a very good question. If he wanted to, yes. Would I steer him that way? No I wouldn't. 
- Why? 
- And he actually plays a lot of soccer. He's liking soccer, and a lot of people including me thought soccer would probably never make it in this country, but it really is moving forward rapidly. 
- Yes, we, we tried to keep soccer out for a long time, but, but it's hard, it's moving so rapidly. That's how the caravan does it. They just dribble their kids up to the border, and then just a little bit of that, little bit of this, little bit of that. Little dip dip, dah, dah, dah. Little dah, and then they bicycle kick him into El Paso. Yelling goal! That's really why we need the wall. But it's so hard to build when you can't use your hands. Soccer, soccer. Soccer Jon. 
- Soccer. Is that soccer, is it? 
- And he explained his concerns about football. 
- I just don't like the reports that I see coming out having to do with football. 
- [Margaret] Concussions? 
- Yeah, concussions and other things. Knees and hips and shoulders and elbows, and everything else. 
- Heads, shoulders, knees, and toes. Knees and toes. Eyes and ears and mouth and many people say, and I'm hearing this a lot, and nose. But, here's the deal. Trump's not gonna be president forever. Who knows? 
- You get clapping for that. 
- Who knows? I don't know, I don't know. 
- [Jon] They clapping for that. 
- We're barely a month into 2019 and we've already got at least 10 different candidates hoping to secure the Democratic Party's nomination, 'cause on Friday another Democrat entered the race. New Jersey senator and man trying to pass universal healthcare with his mind, Cory Booker. Here's a little taste of Cory Booker's video announcement. 
- When I was a baby, my parents tried to move us into a neighborhood with great public schools, but realtors wouldn't sell us a home because of the color of our skin. So over 20 years ago, I moved into the central ward of Newark to fight slumlords, and help families stay in their homes. I still live there today. 
- That is inspiring, and I gotta say daring. I've never seen anyone so proud to be from Newark. Newark, home of the airport you didn't realize you were landing at. Come, because you're lost. Stay, because you're lost. Remember when all those parked cars caught on fire? That was this week. This week, in Newark. And, there was a lot of not so subtle anti-Trump messaging in this ad. Booker tells the story of a racist landlord turning away his parents. Imagery of kids in cages, and of course a scene of him in a barbershop, which is an obvious dig at Trump since it implies Booker could grow hair, but chooses not to. But, but. [Music] I don't believe it's fair [Music] 
- But Booker's taken a real risk with the name of his campaign, Cory 2020. Bold move, going with the first name. If you'll recall, that did not work out too well for Jeb! 2016. Also, I don't know how I feel about having a President Cory. Sounds like a Disney show. Probably because it was a Disney show. We got a great show for you tonight. Conan O'Brien is here! But when we return, I become a player in Madden NFL 19. Stick around. I'm passed the midway.

- Yeah? 
- Boom. 
- Yeah. 
- Jon, I'm pretty excited. We have our old friend, Conan O'Brien coming out here in just a minute, Conan O'Brien? 
- Funny guy, he's a great guy. Love Conan. 
- James Taylor, James Taylor's gonna perform here tonight at the Ed Sullivan Theater, and we have a special little game we're going to be playing with our good friend Steve Carell is gonna be here tonight too. 
- Oh yeah, y'all go way back! 
- That's the best show. This is the Super Bowl-
- 
- Yeah you gotta do it. 
- Tonight is the Super Bowl of late night shows, I gotta say, right now. Also tomorrow, Taraji P. Henson is gonna be here. That's gonna be fantastic. Never interviewed her before, right first time? Think so. 
- Yeah. 
- Of course, as I said this is our Super Bowl special, and I love football. I've always wanted to play the game professionally, but my doctor says I can't because I have a medical condition known as mortality. But there is some football I am healthy enough to participate in, the video game kind, and luckily the good folks over at EA Sports agreed to make me a player in the new Madden NFL 19. 
- Yeah baby! 
- Here's the deal. I was excited, obviously, but in order to make the most life-like and accurate digital version of me, they first needed hard data on my athletic abilities. So I headed out to the Atlantic Health New York Jets Training Center, and put my skills to the test. Stephen Colbert, Northwestern University, theater major. I've always been told I don't have what it takes to play professional football. And that is true. Luckily, the fine people at Madden NFL 19 agreed to put me in their game. So I met with league player ratings adjuster, Dustin Smith, so he could rank my footbally-ness. Dustin, can I call you Dusty? 
- Uh. 
- Dusty? What's considered a good score? What's the scale here? 
- 99's the best. 
- Okay. What type of things are you gonna be judging me in today, Dusty? 
- Strength, speed, throw power, kick power, kick accuracy, catching, jumping. 
- Is, there's no blood test today is there? Because I am high as a kite right now. Anytime I know I need to use my knees, I get an epidural. What do you think my rating's gonna be? 
- Conservative, 20. 
- To help me figure out just where I stand, we brought in six foot four New York Jets quarterback Sam Darnold. Sam. 
- Sir. 
- Thanks so much for talking to me today. 
- Absolutely. 
- How old are you? 
- I am 21 years old. Yeah. 
- And the fact that you are younger than my oldest child is in no way depressing to me. 
- No, it's not a concern is it? 
- Nope, no it's not. But since you're on the Jets, do you ever feel like breaking out into singing songs from West Side Story? 
- Um-
- [Music] When you're a Jet you're a Jet all the way [Music] [Music] From your first cigarette to your [Music] 
- Oh gosh. [Music] I like to live in America [Music] Come on! 
- Come on you got it. 
- You gotta. 
- Where's Dusty? Bring in Dusty. 
- Do this Sam. 
- I can't dance. 
- [Stephen] It was time for my first official test, catching. 
- Ready, set hut! Oh, you gotta jump up and grab it. 
- What the hell is that? What the hell is that? 
- You gotta jump up and get the ball. 
- How tall do you think I am? 
- Set hut. Are you serious? 
- You throw that really hard. 
- Set hut. That was sweet. 
- Okay. 
- [Sam] That was really cool. And the spin. 
- [Stephen] Next up, throw under pressure. 
- [Dustin] Throw under pressure. 
- Throw under pressure, see that? You could cut a diamond, all right? Bring it. 
- All right, guys. 
- Hi, Stephen. Stephen, hi. Stephen, hi. Nice to meet ya. This is a comedy show. Obviously you guys were told that this is a comedy show? Good, good. Set hut! 
- [Dustin] That's gotta be like, the worst. 
- 18, what the (bleep)? I don't think Dustin's giving me a fair shake. I mean... I'm a 54 year old man. The doctor said I'd never be able to comb my hair again. It's like he doesn't even see how I'm trying. Please don't use this. Promise me. Back on the field, 'cause it's time for speed. Just when you're ready to go, just yell juice it! 
- [Dustin] Juice it, you got it. 
- I'm just trying to determine which knee I want to pop first. 
- Juice it! 
- Look at that. 
- Woo! Then my juke move. I gonna juke ya, watch out! Watch out, woo, woo! Here we go, woo wah! And finally, trucking. 
- [Dustin] I'm gonna need you to knock over one of these big fellas, and you stay on your feet and keep going. 
- Hut! Time for my final rating. What is my player rating, and the important thing is that I need to really know. This is important, this is on television. You have to tell me the truth, and don't worry about my feelings. I have a successful career, I have a beautiful wife, I have wonderful children. Just be honest, it's important that I, I know what the truth is, and you're not gonna hurt my feelings. 
- Okay, so officially, 19 overall. 
- Stemming from my unfair rating, I switched to an activity I excel at. Sitting in a chair. To create my digital player, certified EA nerd Ben Haumiller entered my test results. Speed, strength, agility. What has he got me for elusiveness? 
- [Ben] 47. 
- I could be way more elusive than that. You wanna, I'll show you how elusive I can be. 
- Okay. 
- Tell me you love me. 
- I love you. 
- God I don't deserve you. See, you have no idea whether I love you or not. 
- I don't. 
- Yet, I haven't said anything bad, okay? That's elusive. Okay let's take a look at me, here we go! Okay that looks like me. Let's do-ee. Oh good, I'm wearing glasses. So few football players do. Is there any way to take this uniform off? 'Cause I've never seen me with anything approaching a male physique. 
- We are an E for everyone game. 
- Okay. 
- So. Actually would you like to run a play? 
- Sure. There I am, as a quarterback, and I already have a penalty. What the hell just happened? What did I do? 
- [Ben] You're not happy as the coach, either. 
- [Stephen] Yep, how old do you, wait a second. How old did you make me as the coach? 
- [Ben] Oh come on, you're smoothed out right there. You're looking all right. 
- [Stephen] You look like you carved my head out of an apple core and let it dry in the sun. Good god, man. 
- [Man] Here we go now! 
- All right, in the pocket, bullet! And, I suck. I suck in real life. Why would I want to suck in a game? Look, even I'm mad at me. I agree with that guy. Now Ben. 
- Yes? 
- This is all just zeroes and ones, right? 
- [Ben] Mhmm. 
- Well what if I gave you a one with two zeroes behind it, would that help change my profile? 
- I like this. 
- Thank you. With that and just a few clicks, Ben pumped up all of my stats and gave me a tight end. Oh yeah. Badonk-a-donk. Back it up like a Tonka truck. God I'm magnificent. And, go. Here we go, drills it! Here comes the pain train! All aboard, unh! 
- Touchdown! 
- [Stephen] Woo! How do you like me now? Boom. 
- Right there. 
- Woo, woo! Oh come on, woo! Thank you EA Sports, thank you New York Jets! We'll be right back with Conan O'Brien.

- Thank you very much! 
- Conan O'Brien. Nice to see ya. 
- Thank you very much, it's a lovely crowd. 
- They're lovely, they're lovely people. 
- Thank you. 
- It's very exciting to see Conan O'Brien. 
- What a day-
- 
- Back on the East Coast. 
- What a day. 
- It's always a treat for us. 
- Yep, back in town. 
- Yeah. 
- Big day. 
- For the Super Bowl. 
- The Super Bowl. 
- The Super Bowl obviously. 
- That was a crazy game. 
- It was. You have exciting news. The new Conan. 
- It's really not. It's the same Conan. It's the same Conan-
- 
- You're the same Conan, but it's a new format. 
- It's a new format. 
- New set. 
- Doing it for so long, I said that let's do half an hour because we noticed that our crowd after a half an hour, they were like, we're good. 
- Really? 
- Anyway. 
- I think in show business we call that leave 'em wanting some. 
- Yeah. No even at half an hour they're like, you know you could go to 15, so. 
- Now, there's tonight obviously you're dressed beautifully, but suede, a suede jacket. 
- Yeah. 
- I'm seeing a lot more leather jackets. 
- Yeah, yeah. 
- Denim, a lot more denim for you. No more suits. 
- Yes, I like to look like a prosperous farmer, you know? A farmer who's invested well in high tech. That's the look I'm going for. Yeah, no it's important to me. I got tired of wearing the suit, and I think the suit's great, but I did it for so many years I thought-
- 
- You said that like you were afraid to hurt the suit's feelings. Suit's great, suit's fantastic. 
- I'm sorry, suit, there's a suit right here going come on, give me a chance. No, it looks great, it looks terrific, but I feel like you're interviewing me for a bank loan. I wanted to just sort of, I'm a real hard worker. I wanted to kind of just wear the kind of clothes that I do in real life. The only thing that's important to me is that I wear a jacket. I have to wear a jacket. 
- Why is this? 
- Thank you for asking. It's going just as we rehearsed. I wear, I have to wear a jacket 'cause I have to break up where the middle of my body is because I have a, and this is a confession. I have a very disproportionate body. When I was 14 years old, I had a massive growth spurt, massive. I am six feet four. I became, I went from being a kid to six feet four overnight, literally overnight. What happened is my legs grew and grew and grew, and my torso never did. I have the legs, the legs of an NBA center and I have the torso of a little girl. And you know what? She's not even a healthy little girl. She was born in the 1840s, her name's Molly, and she has rickets. 
- We actually have, we have an image of your torso. 
- Oh that's great, thank you very much. That's my torso right there. That was from a long time ago, yeah thanks. 
- Right there. 
- Thanks for showing that! 
- You look fine. 
- Thank you. 
- You look fine. 
- That's funny. No one mentioned you'd be showing that photo. 
- Keep up the B-12. 
- Yeah. But it is, I have and so I have very very long legs and then this tiny little torso that sits atop the, and people think I'm exaggerating, but I can prove to you that I am not, no. Look at this. This. This is my natural. And look, Stephen. 
- Yes? 
- I look like a shorebird avoiding an oil spill, don't I? It's just a freak show, and then I have this little R2-D2 body on top. It's a freak show, it's a freak show and it's caused me-
- 
- It is. 
- And I have-
- 
- No photographs, no papier-mache. He is alive. 
- He's alive, he's alive! And my pants, I'm always pushing them down. They're pushed down now. They are artificially pushed down. My penis is here. When I use a urinal, I have to flip the tie back. Unbutton two buttons, ladies, not one. Lean down, take care of business. 
- Sure, sure, sure. 
- It's a bad scene, man. A real bad scene. 
- So no more suits, so no more suits. 
- You break it up a little bit. I realized I just undid all the good I'm trying to do by displaying my body, but yeah. It's been a source of great shame for me, and I want other kids out there-
- 
- I'm glad, I'm glad, I'm glad. 
- You're glad that I feel shame? 
- Yes, a little shame is a good thing. 
- It's a very good thing. 
- After, 25 years on the air. The show has changed. What else have you learned about yourself over the years? Because certainly you, when you do one of these shows you learn what you're capable of, but then you find out things about yourself that you never knew. 
- Yes, I found out, and this isn't even through the show. This is just life as you go on in life, when I started my show I had just turned 30. I didn't know who I was yet. I've grown up and become sort of a man. On television over this last 25 years, but I'm finding out new things all the time. I found out, I went to go see my doctor a couple of months ago, and just for a physical. He was doing the physical, and he said By the way Conan, I don't know if you're into this, but I do DNA testing, I'm very good at it. We could find out about your heritage. I think some people have done that 23andMe. I said, sure, let's do it. So he took a DNA sample, and I left. Two weeks later, he called me up and he said, I've never, ever, ever, had a DNA result like this before, and I've been doing this for 10 years. And I said what is it? And he said you are, this is true, You are 100% Irish. Now listen, there's more, hold it. He said you are 100%. He said, I've never seen a 100% anything. He said I've been doing this a lot. I've done it with lots of people. I've seen 93.5, I've seen 96.1, I've seen 96, there's no such, no one is 100% Irish.

It'll all go well, you know? So Irish-looking, and so I, I, I stopped the madness. I stopped the madness. Let me tell you about my wife. Been married 17 years, I love her to death.
