- [Announcer] This is Daily Blast Live. We are talking about what you're talking about. 
- 'Cause everyone's talking about this. 
- [Announcer] Always live, always real, always unpredictable. 
- You are totally off-base here! 
- [Announcer] Log on and join our live conversation. 
- I can't believe I'm saying this, I do agree with you. 
- [Announcer] DBL starts right now. 
- [Director] Three, two. 
- Welcome to DBL. It's Wednesday, February 13th. We are live and we are talking about what you're talking about. I'm here with Tory, Jeff, Al, and I'm Sam. And if you haven't noticed, we have a very special guest co-host. You all know him as Dr. Drew Pinsky, but you're so much more to me. I know you've heard this a gazillion times by now but you're not only a friend, you're my mentor, and I really do owe sitting in this chair to you. So, thank you. 
- There's a reason we worked with you. You're good. 
- Aww, Drew! 
- So that's that. 
- That means so much to me. 
- [Al] Emergency fallout. 
- Wow, Al. Geez! 
- I love some Sammy. 
- Okay, it's harsh. 
- Well, thank you for being here, Dr. Drew. We begin with an update to a story we've been tracking. Empire star Jussie Smollett is hitting back at reports that he has changed his story, or has not been fully cooperative with police who are investigating his alleged attack. Jussie's reps released a statement that says in part, Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us that they find Jussie's account of what happened that night consistent and credible. Superintendent Johnson has been clear from day one that Jussie is a victim. This comes a day after a spokesperson for the Chicago Police Department said that the phone records that Jussie turned over, Do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation as they were limited and heavily redacted. Now, Jussie's reps contend that information was redacted to protect the privacy of personal contacts and other high-profile people who had nothing to do with the attack, and tomorrow, Jussie is sitting down with GMA's Robin Roberts in what looks to be a highly emotional interview. Check out this teaser. 
- At any point during the attack, did you fear for your life? 
- [Jeff] I'm good. 
- So, very emotional interview. Dr. Drew, I know on your radio show, you've been following this case in and out. What would you say to the narrative out there that's pushing that he may be making this up? 
- Yeah, I just think everyone needs to calm down and not grab onto any narrative. It's not our job to create a narrative, it's the Chicago PD's to figure out the facts and put that narrative together and then tell us what the deal is. Something happened to him. If he has overstated it for some reason, I'm also still worried about him and what happened that made him distort this thing. So, all of us sit back and just let this thing play out. It's not our business! This mob action that we always get into drives me insane. 
- And Tory, you've had a pretty strong take on this. 
- Yeah, I mean, but you have to understand, innocent until proven guilty is because we believe in America, that we believe our victims at first. And if it's not true, Dr. Drew's right, there might be something else wrong. But at this point, imagine had he let us see his phone. We're already this way and we haven't seen anything. I mean, Tom Brady didn't give up his phone when it was Deflategate and yet, we're jumping on this guy. I agree with Dr. Drew. Let's just put a pause on everything for a second. 
- Yeah, fair enough, I agree. 
- I think anything that we get from this story will help push your narrative. There's money to be made from Division. 
- Oh, boy. 
- So, if-
- 
- [Drew] You're breaking my heart. 
- Yes, unfortunately it's the world we live in. If this is proven to be a hoax, now all the conspiracy theorists now go, and you know what else was a hoax? 
- Right. 
- Sandy Hook. 
- Parkland. 
- The Moon! 
- Sandy Hooks, the Pizzagate, and so if it's not, then there's other places will be like, see, we're under attack. So, it's like, everybody has, unfortunately, a financial interest in how this story turns out. I guarantee you a lot of people commenting on this are not fans of his, and don't care about his physical wellbeing. They just see him, or the kid at the National Museum with the Native American, as just a way to further-
- 
- Their agenda. 
- Further their agenda. 
- I just encourage people, if there are holes in your story, you think there's holes in his story, which I don't, watch the interview and make up your own opinion. Don't listen to what people are writing online. 
- So wait for tomorrow. We will definitely be covering the interview tomorrow. 
- Absolutely. 
- I agree. 
- But I don't wanna emphasize Al's point. The media out there creates narrative. We're having a conversation about it but you with those headlines that take a specific position, one way or the other, that is for the good of the network that is giving you the narrative and nothing else. 
- They wanna capture your eyes so they can make money. 
- Right. 
- As you said. 
- They figure out what you wanna hear and they keep feeding it to ya. 
- Be an independent thinker, please, and chime in, DBL Nation, we wanna hear from you as well. Well, we finally have some good news coming out of Washington, D.C. right now. Let's get to Kelly Schuberth with the latest. 
- Sam, we're just two days away from another partial government shutdown, but it looks like the president may now stop that from happening. We told you about a tentative deal that congressional negotiators came up with Monday night. Trump said he wasn't happy with the deal, but Today's sources say that he is expected to sign it. In the meantime, Senator Ted Cruz is backing a different plan to get the President the money he wants for his wall. Cruz sent this Tweet saying we should use the money U.S. prosecutors are seeking from now-convicted El Chapo. They're seeking 14 billion in drug profits and other assets, and Cruz says that money should go towards securing the border. Sam, I'll keep you updated. 
- Thank you so much, Kelly. Well, we have a new top dog. Meet King, the Fox Terrier. Look at his beard! (laughing) Took home the Best in Show Award last night at the Westminster Dog Show in New York City. Competition was rough, but once again, the Fox Terrier won the top prize. This marks the 15th time that breed has come out on top, much more than any other. Bono the Havanese took second. 
- They were robbed! 
- [Sam] But many were upset that the fan-favorite, a Longhaired Dachshund named Burns, Tory's favorite, did not win. And in a socking turn of events, the Schipperke named Colton, who won the Non-Sporting Group, was disqualified-
- 
- Scandal! 
- Scandal! 
- [Sam] The moment before the judging due to a conflict of interest. Other top dogs include Baby Lars, who won the Herding Group. He's a Bouvier des Flandres. 
- [Drew] Bouvier des Flandres. And great pronunciation on that. I thought I was back in France. 
- And this Sussex Spaniel named Bean, who won the Sporting Group, and finally meet Wilma, the Boxer, who took home the Gold for the Working Group. But it wasn't just us humans who enjoyed watching the dog competition. Check out all these dogs who really got into the action. Tory, I know, now first of all, scandal really, Tory? 
- Big scandal. 
- What? 
- Big Scandal. 
- No! 
- The Schipperke was in it, and guess what? They shook hands with the judge and said, I need you to leave. That is huge in the dog world, am I right? 
- I don't know. 
- He does know. 
- I had to do the shaking hands, like they're gonna kiss, and then you're gonna go-
- 
- And then it was. 
- Wait, do we know why? 
- Yes, because the judge was a co-owner of said dog. 
- Ugh. Oh, no! 
- It was an owner eligibility issue. 
- Shouldn't that be illegal? 
- Well, it was. He did a nice lap and then he walked. 
- Oh. 
- I just have to say this, the Wire, I know you're a dog-person. 
- I am a dog-person. 
- The Wire Fox Terrier has won 15 times, okay? The bearded guy that looks like Sherlock? 
- He's Beerlock. 
- He looks like a guy. 
- He looks like a guy, right? 
- I wouldn't want him in my bedroom when I'm dressing. 
- And I'm not saying this 'cause I own a Dachshund. At some point, that Dachshund was on that night, and he stood like this, and he and the crowd-
- 
- Okay. 
- Okay, sorry. 
- Can I get a one-shot on Tory while she does that? Do it, Tory. 
- [Tory] Okay, so. 
- This is the Dachshund, one-shot on Tory. 
- [Al] Please don't put me in it, there you go. 
- Thank you. (clapping) 
- And he shoulda won! 
- Well done, well done. 
- And win that, but it was Madison Square Garden! Thank you everyone, thank you. 
- Wow, look at Jeff. 
- It's crazy! 
- Hey, could we move past this? 
- Yeah, so angry! 
- We covered this story more than the Super Bowl. 
- He's so angry. 
- This is insane. 
- Can somebody explain to me why I watch it religiously every year after the Macy's Parade on Thanksgiving? Is this a recorded version? 
- It's such a tradition! 
- No, this is Westminster. The other one is another one. 
- That's the National Dog Show. 
- Yes, exactly, correct. 
- This is the Westminster. But this is the more prestigious one, right? 
- A bit, yes. 
- I think it's a little antiquated. 
- Oh! 
- It is, completely. 
- They should have rescue dogs only. 
- And they do. They have a whole separate one for rescue but I-
- 
- Yes, they call it The One People Don't Watch. 
- Yeah, I like the beautiful dogs, come on now. 
- Okay, wow! 
- 'Cause you wouldn't have to buy one, it's just. 
- Oh, how fun was it. 
- I'm with you.

- [Narrator] New Dr. Phil. 
- [Announcer] Today at four, followed by WUSA9 News at five. 
- Welcome back to DBL. As you know, we have a very special guest in studio today. He's a board certified physician and addiction medicine specialist. You know him from Loveline, Dr. Drew On Call, and Celebrity Rehab. He's my dear friend. Welcome Dr. Drew Pinsky. 
- Yeah, yeah, yeah! 
- Yes! 
- Pleasure to be here, guys. 
- [Sam] And this is exciting because-
- 
- Only, you traumatized me with those pictures, but thanks. 
- Well, we, this is important because a lot of our viewers at home, you guys love Dr. Drew, his advice on addiction and relationships, but today we're focusing on relationships. 
- Okay. 
- We've asked our viewers to send in their love-related questions for a segment we're calling Dear DBL, with Dr. Drew. So let's get started. Al, let's take the first one. 
- [Al] All right! It says, Wanting More in Saint Louis: My bedroom life with my girlfriend sucks! 
- Uh-oh. 
- Okay! 
- [Al] And we're only in the first year of our relationship. Three times a week if I'm lucky. Am I the bad guy for wanting to break up with her over this? 
- Okay, well mismatched sexual desire is a very common thing. Three times a week, above average by the way, not bad. 
- She doing good! 
- I'd say Tory and Sam do a little bit like oh, what the hell here. 
- What? 
- What? 
- How much this guy want but that is mismatched sexual desire 
- That's above average? 
- Yeah. 
- [Sam] Well, what about it being the first year? 
- Above average. Average in long-term relationship is about 1 1/2, two times a week, average. 
- But what about a new relationship like this? 
- We just learned something about Al, too. Just make that known. 
- [Al] If not twice a day, it wasn't a day. 
- Oh, Lord, Al! 
- Right and some people are at that rate, that's for sure. 
- Yeah. 
- And people have to reach a compromise. 
- What? 
- See, we just learned something about Jeff, too. 
- If twice a day is not a day, how do you get anything done? 
- There's this thing called morning and night, Jeff. 
- Yeah, I love sleep. 
- A lot is revealed just in answering these questions, but it's about compromising and you have to be able to tell her that this is not your rate and you have to step it up. There may be things contributing to that. We don't think about this, and one of the things that I see most commonly in young couples, when a female sexual desire is not matching a man, she may be on a high progesterone birth control pill and that suppresses their libido and doctors don't tell 'em about that. So take a look at your birth control. The progesterones can really be working against you. 
- Good to know. 
- That's amazing. 
- Wow. 
- This guy! 
- I know! He's like a fountain of knowledge. Ellie Mae writes, I'm in a marriage where my husband gambles compulsively and frequents gentleman's clubs. 
- Uh-oh. 
- After 34 years of marriage, we are drowning in debt. 
- Oh! 
- Oh, boy. 
- Should I walk out? This is Ellie Mae. 
- So, Ellie Mae, this is for real. Ellie Mae? 
- Yeah. 
- Like from the Beverly Hillbillies? 
- Yeah. 
- It's amazing. 
- Burt, that was for you. So, yeah, this is really, this is a tragedy. And this is a great example of how real gambling addiction, when you really see it, it destroys lives. There may be some sexual addiction in here, too. He's going to gentleman clubs. You have to decide if you're gonna leave or not. I'd for sure go to a program called Al-Anon, which is support for those and loved one's with addictions of various types. There's specific ones for gambling and sex addicts, but Al-Anon's easier to find and then think about what you wanna do with this. But absolutely, he gets treatment or you leave is a very reasonable position to be in. 
- Wow. 
- Wow, that's good to hear. 
- Sad. 
- Ruth in Louisvile writes, I'm dating someone going through a divorce. We both feel strongly about each other, but she's not ready for a relationship right now. Yet, we both can't stop seeing each other, and it feels more like a rebound. Is our timing setting us up to fail? 
- And, but I gotta answer, finish up on that last question, too. He goes to gamblers, like GA, Gambler's Anonymous. Or SLA, Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous, Sex Addicts Anonymous, back to this one. This is Trevor, right? 
- Mm-hmm. 
- Is that him? No, it's not. 
- Yup. 
- No, yes, Trevor? 
- This is Ruth. 
- Oh, Ruth. 
- Ruth. 
- Ruth. 
- Ruth, I'm... When somebody's going through a divorce, you don't wanna get hooked into a long-term relationship. You wanna wait 'til that's all over with and behind them. You're more of a life-preserver when somebody is going through that kind of a horrible crisis in their life. We need a lot more information to kinda tease it out for you, but I-
- 
- [Sam] Could it work out? 
- It could, but I got bad feelings about this. 
- Whoa, okay. 
- Yeah. 
- Interesting. 
- Mm. 
- That's you, Jeff, it's your turn. 
- I just read Ruth. 
- I'll read Trevor in Tampa. 
- Oh, geez! 
- Boom! 
- Trevor in Tampa said, My girlfriend gets mad at me-
- 
- [Jeff] That'll teach you how to handle my business up there. 
- [Drew] I love it! For not posting pictures of us together on social media. I like to post about my hobbies, not relationships, but she thinks I'm hiding her. Who is in the wrong here? 
- [Sam] That's a relatable one. 
- It is a relatable one, and, ugh. You, sir. You, sir, need to step up because she's letting you know something very simple that could make her very happy, and why wouldn't you do that if you know it's something that really would help somebody or make her feel good and she's somebody you say you love, why wouldn't you wanna do that? 
- Amen. 
- Wow! 
- Amen! 
- Drew, quickly, what's wrong with our dysfunctional family? 
- Yeah, what's wrong here? 
- Yes! 
- I'm mostly worried about you and Sam, Jeff. That's where I see the trouble. 
- I'm off the hook! 
- Yeah. 
- Tory? 
- They're all doin' pretty good. 
- Al? I don't know about that. 
- Well, I'm normal. 
- All right. 
- Everybody says I'm the normal one. 
- Sure, okay. 
- We heard a little (stammering) you're above normal in certain areas, Al, just saying. 
- [Hosts] Oh! 
- I get that a lot. 
- We found that out 10 minutes ago, five minutes ago. 
- Coming up on DBL, a lot of people are saying Esquire magazine missed the mark with this cover story. We'll tell you what all the commotion is about. And talk about a throw back. Actor Anson Williams from Happy Days settles the score once and for all. So, who's cooler, Potsie or the Fonz? Come on now, the Fonz. He tells our own Tory Schulmen next. 
- [Tory] It was Potsie. 
- Shh, that's it. Sleep tight, little one. 
- Thanks, mom. You take such good care of him. 
- That's what grandmas do. 
- I don't know what we'd do without you. 
- Well, I made sure you'll have help even after I'm gone. 
- After you're gone? Mom, are you okay? 
- Everything is fine. Just so you know, I got a life insurance policy, so when the time comes, I won't leave you a financial mess. Let's face it. There will be a funeral, and maybe medical bills. It's not an inheritance or anything, but it will help cover my expensenses. 
- I don't wanna think about that. 
- Well, you don't have to. I already took care of it. And with this policy, I can earn discounts, get rewards, and even get tips on how to live healthy. That could help me be around even longer for that little guy.

- [Announcer] Today's Watch and Win word is sunglasses. 
- Welcome back to DBL. All month long, I am talking with TV legends from the past to find out where they are now. So, I headed to The Hollywood Museum in the heart of Los Angeles, California and sat down with Anson Williams, better known as Potsie from [Music] Monday, Tuesday, Happy Days [Music] Check it out. [Music] Monday, Tuesday, I'm in heaven [Music] (laughing) It was very, very good opening. I am here with someone that I've always had a secret crush on and now it's not so secret. It's Anson Williams of Happy Days. Hello, how are you? 
- I am good. Those are original lyrics. 
- [Tory] I was gonna say. 
- I haven't heard those lyrics before. 
- Never heard that before, it's amazing. You play one of the most iconic characters ever on TV. Do you have a favorite memory? 
- Actually the best memories aren't on the show, they're off the show. We had a softball team and we went all over the world. 
- [Tory] Get outta here! What was your team name? 
- Let me guess! Happy Days! 
- Happy Days! That was very clever. 
- I like how original that was. 
- Yeah, it was, do ya like that? 
- [Tory] So, you were best friends with Richie Cunningham, Ron Howard. We also have Fonzie, Henry Winkler. We wanna know straight up, which one made you laugh harder? 
- Oh, Henry, yeah. He's a genius. There's no words for it. Just universal hysterics. Look at the character he created, Fonzie. That was not written. 
- [Tory] Do you still keep in touch with these guys? 
- We do! 
- Yes? 
- We do. 
- That makes me happy. 
- [Anson] We've been friends forever. 
- Now, a lot of people actually told me they had crushes on you, but Fonzie was sort of the cool guy. Did Potsie ever wanna be Fonzie? 
- Who would not wanna be Fonzie? Are you kidding? Let's be truthful! 
- Let's be honest, here. 
- All right? Come on! Oh, no, I like Potsie better. What? Shoot me now. 
- I heard that maybe one of The Beatles came by? 
- A couple of The Beatles. 
- Tell me about that, 'cause I think I'm all (screams) about this. 
- I was (screams) about that. You're on a set, Happy Days. There's a guy standing by the coffee machine that looks just like Jonh Lennon in sunglasses and some kid, and Donny goes, Oh, yeah. John Lennon came here to hang out with us (laughs). It was John Lennon who came here to hang out with us. You bet. The nicest, kindest, shyest guy. He's doing doodles for, like literally, original John Lennon doodles for the crew-
- 
- You know how much those are worth? 
- Yeah, for the crew. Not us, oh no, we're professionals. We don't ask for anything. The crew bought houses with the freakin' picture. I haven't told anyone. On this show will be the first. 
- Exclusive! 
- And this just happened. It's exclusive, four, five, six months ago? There's this very nice looking man. So I'm sitting there and all of a sudden I hear, Excuse me, I don't mean to interrupt. It was Julian Lennon. 
- [Tory] I'm sorry, I don't mean to-
- 
- 40 years later. 
- Oh my god! 
- [Anson] Can we take a selfie? 40 years later, it all came around. 
- [Tory] That's a great story. 
- True story. 
- That's a crazy story. I think all the millennials know Buy One Get One which is my favorite thing in the whole wide world. You found a way to curate it all in one area. 
- You bet.

We certainly would recommend it to any of our friends.
