- No, this is just who has the most, remember they wanted to do a smaller deal. 
- But they probably, we heard Adrian talk about it, there's no interest. When there's no interest guess what kind of deals are available to you? The minimum exception, so we might as well put all 30 teams there. 
- Right, no, that's very interesting. Well, we're gonna have to see. We might know more by tonight, right? Could know about Kawhi by tonight, could know about Boogie by tonight. Come hang out with us, 7:00 Eastern on ESPN. Until then watch your phones 'cause it's free agency. Lots going on. 
- Come on U.S. team, let's do it. 
- Coming up on this Tuesday edition of NFL Live, Juju Smith-Schuster joins us. He'll talk about taking over the Steeler's top receiver and what his relationship with Antonio Brown looks like now. We highlights some of the NFL stars that are nominated for ESPYS, including a look back at Drew Brees' record-breaking Monday night football performance. Plus, we hand out our own award for the player with the best highlights, Patrick Mahomes, Sequon, or Kyler in the running, who will be crowned your highlight king? Happy to have you with us on this Tuesday afternoon, holiday week. Wendy Nix, Dianna Russini, Victor Cruz and Mike Tannenbaum. We will start with news regarding Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliot. Zeke is once again headed to the commissioners office. The Dallas Cowboys running back expected to meet with the commissioner Roger Goodell today in New York City regarding a May incident in Las Vegas. The meeting comes after an incident at a Las Vegas music festival in May in which Elliot had a confrontation of sorts with a security guard. He was briefly detained but never arrested or charged in the incident. Nevertheless the Commissioner wants to here him out, hear what happened, Diana, what more can you tell us? 
- At this point right now we don't know what exactly is going on in that meeting but they are meeting in Manhattan to discuss Zeke's behavior in that Las Vegas incident. Jerry Jones, of course, has stood by his running back, saying that he doesn't see anything wrong with what he saw on video tape. Again, Zeke was in those handcuffs and then those handcuffs were removed. He was not charged, he could still face punishment if Goodell decides that he violated the league's personal conduct policy and that's what this meeting is to discuss but as of now we are not sure what the future holds but those that I've spoken to with the Cowboys organization, strongly feel confident that Zeke will not face a suspension in this because of this incident. 
- Mike as a DM I know you had players who had face-to-face meetings with the commissioner, who had hearings or due diligence, if you will. What's your take on the process? 
- Yeah, despite how the Cowboys are feeling, a suspension certainly is in play. We have to remember under the personal conduct policy, a player can be suspended even though there may not be criminal charges and the fact that Ezekiel Elliot is meeting in person with the Commissioner signals to me that a suspension, albeit one game, two games, could be in play here and he was sent to New York for a reason. So, we'll see how it plays out in the coming days but his prior behavior will certainly be a factor in their assessment. 
- Well let's shift gears to between the lines. Victor, how important is the running game to this current Dallas Cowboys team? 
- It's huge, especially Ezekiel Elliot, right? He's been the focal point of that offense, especially from the running back perspective, year in and year out. Things he can do with the ball in his hands whether out in space or just handing him the football behind that fantastic offensive line. I mean, he is in my opinion the heartbeat of that offense. Obviously Dak is the leader but Ezekiel's the one that makes them go. As he does well, then you got the play-action pass and everything compliments the attributes of Ezekiel Elliot, so, obviously if he's there to miss any significant amount of time, you know, the Cowboys would be looking to replace that, those statistics and those numbers that he puts up week in and week out in a different way. 
- Yeah, and Vic you just hit the nail on the head. When you look Dak Prescott, his pass rating goes from 97 to 122 play-action compared to traditional drop-back. So you can see the importance of the running game. Ezekiel Elliot, obviously opposing defenses are focusing in on stopping Ezekiel Elliot and that's a very impactful, in terms of his impact on Prescott's production to go from 97 to 122. That's a huge jump in terms of his play-action productivity. 
- Huge jump and we'll talk about Dak's deal and when it may get done but I'd be interested to see how all of you feel like this Dallas Cowboys team stacks up in the division. 
- I think they're right there at the top. I think they're competing, obviously them and Philadelphia are right there neck and neck and gonna be battling it out throughout the season but I think that they got all the tools. When you look at them defensively from the defensive line all the way back to the secondary, they're loaded at each position. And then offensively like we just talked about, Dak Prescott, Ezekiel Elliot, Martin Cooper, Randall Cobb, Jason, I could go on for days with this but they have all of the talent. 
- [Mike] Receivers. 
- [Victor] Exactly. We got all of the talent, and not to mention 
- [Wendy] They have a new offense coordinator 
- [Victor] In Clamor obviously. Which obviously comes from college and doing those different things. So, he'll provide some creativity that we probably haven't seen and some different type of plays that we haven't seen necessarily from the Dallas Cowboys. 
- You're not going with the Eagles, you're going with the Dallas Cowboys to win that division? 
- Yes, unfortunately, nobody in New York kill me please but I'm going with the Cowboys 
- Right, that was Victor. When does Dak's deal get done? Do we see that done before the start of the season? 
- I think that deal will get before the start of the season. In fact, even just talking to people in the Cowboys organization about the timing of it. It's funny 'cause just a few months ago the way it was being explained to me it was gonna be a while. It wasn't gonna get done. And now it seems that I'm not sure where the pressure is coming from. I don't know why why they're feeling the pressure. But in terms of trying to get that done it seems that that's gonna be a priority for Dallas. 
- You know the pressure really comes from what Dak Prescott's draft day disappoint was is now becoming the reality of a free agent opportunity because he was not a first round pick. Which was a disappointment. But he's now in the final year of his rookie contract. So, unlike guys like Jared Goff and Carson Wentz who had the additional fifth year, he could get to the market. And he may not be a perfect player, I'm a believer in Dak Prescott. Not 'cause only what you do from a passing standpoint but the plays he makes with his legs. If he made it to the open market the way Kirk Hudson did a couple years ago. Hard to say what he could get and I know people could say, well, he could certainly get franchised. But I could tell you from an organization standpoint, when you use the franchise tag, the last position you wanna use it on is the quarterback. Because when you have a franchise tag that means that the player doesn't have to be there for the off season program, doesn't have to be there for training camp. He could come in the Tuesday before opening day, sign the tag, get paid for the whole season and it really puts the whole offense and all those reps that you don't have together Vic. So, it's really a situation where the sense of urgency Diana in my mind it's coming from the fact that this player is 16 games away from becoming a free agent. 
- And then that quarterback also feels that pressure. I mean, and they don't ever really feel like they belong. Do you remember with the Kirk Cousins situation in Washington? He was always out there proving and proving and proving. And I remember talking to him about it and you could tell 
- [Victor] It weighs on him it was wearing on him because he was like the Washington Redskins organization they were just looking to date, and date, and date. And he was looking for a ring. He wanted to get married and he wanted to feel that love, and he never did. For the Cowboys to put that on Dak, that may not work out for them you know, if they wanna make that work. 
- You know what he's married to? Money, a lot of money. I am not crying for Kirk Cousins but it is a point well made. Alright, anyway. Circling back to where we started, and that is the Gillette. The Cowboys certainly hoping that he will not miss any time. A video shows Browns running back. Kareem Hunt being questioned by police after an apparent incident Saturday night. This was at a Cleveland bar. The video published by TMZ Sports. It shows Hunt speaking with a number of officers. He was not arrested, they did not make a police report regarding the incident. This is according to a spokesperson to Cleveland.com. Still to come on NFL Live, Steeler star wide-receiver Smith-Schuster, he of Juju, joins us from across the pond in London.

- [Wendy] Press coverage now from our own Dan Graziano. Sources, according to Dan, CBA talks collective bargaining agreement talks between the NFL and players association are expected to intensify this summer in an effort to get a new deal done by the start of the 2019 season. Three to four negotiating sessions possible in the month of July alone. Former Packers wide receiver Randall Cobb, signed by the Cowboys and free agency, teamed up with Aaron Rodgers for over 5000 receiving yards. After being drafted by the pack in 2011, he will face his former team in week five in Dallas. And he had to say this about moving on from Green Bay It's like the ex-girlfriend that broke up with you. When you see her five years later, you hope you're in a better situation than you were before married, with kids, and you're able to say, yeah I did better without you. You know what, he's right. Nobody says that but that's how everybody feels. 
- But I don't think a breakup has to be contentious. 
- It doesn't matter, you know I don't care if it's the best breakup ever, you don't wanna be like, oh life wasn't so great, you're winning, I'm not. No, you wanna win sorry. It just is what it is. Okay, anyway, that got us thinking five years from now who's better off. Okay, we've seen a number of NFL breakups, if you will. So, again, five year mark, Randall Cobb or the Green Bay Packers, who's better off? 
- I'm going with Randall Cobb, I think he's joining a team in the Cowboys that's a younger team. I think they're an overall better team right now than the Green Bay Packers. But I think in five years he'll be in the playoffs a couple times, he's obviously in the mix of that wide receiving core, he's gonna be a focal point in that slot position. That's an important position nowadays in the NFL and I think overall he'll just be better. Dak Prescott's got a younger quarterback, I think that'll serve him better obviously giving that longevity and be there for a couple years. He can build that comradery and that continuity with Dak which will serve him better five years from now. 
- He's not gonna miss Aaron Rodgers at all. 
- They're a better overall team. 
- (crosstalk drowns out speaker) 
- All right listen, there were no, in my opinion, no more notable breakup than that one between Odell Beckham Jr and the New York Giants. This one's easy if you talk about it now but we're talking about five years from now. Diana who's better off? 
- I'm gonna go with Odell Beckham Jr is gonna be in a much better position. Well first of all he got paid, he got tons of money and he has opportunity to make more money. Price of living in Cleveland is lower, taxes are lower. So, from a personal financial standpoint Odell Beckham Jr is winning big time. But when it comes to football, there is no quarterback that I believe has more potential to be one of the greatest than I believe in what Baker Mayfield could do in terms of the continuity and the team that they're building in Cleveland compared to what they're doing in New York. We're not sure what's gonna happen to Pat Shurmur, if he's gonna be there, you have to feel like he could be on the hot seat this year if it doesn't work. It seems that Cleveland is a much better off space for Odell Beckham Jr. So I think he's gonna look back and go, you know what, that was good. 
- That was good. What's interesting is, the Giants had a couple of breakups also Landon Collins who's better off in five years. 
- I'm gonna go the other way here Diana, I'm gonna go with the New York Giants, Dave Gettleman and that front office. When we look at what they've already done to replace Landon Collins, they acquired Antoine Bethea in free agency and Jabrill Peppers that was part of the trade that sent Odell Beckham Jr to Cleveland. And although Collins is a good player, I thought he was more productive closer to the line of scrummage. When you look at the way Peppers plays he could replace him, he's younger, more athletic, and less expensive. So, Wendy it's not five years. We know right now we're better off without Landin. 
- Wow alright, fair enough, noted. You know I said there was no bigger breakup but as soon as I said that I thought about AB and the Steelers. I'm gonna retract that. But anyway, Antonio Brown and the Steelers. This one I think is tricky cause again, you're talking about five seasons out who's better off. 
- I'm going with the Steelers here. I really feel like the Steelers organization as a whole, they're gonna be turned the page fully from the Antonio Brown drama, they're gonna be lookin' at Juju. He's gonna be tenured, he's gonna be a true veteran leader on that team. Understand who he is. Big Ben, who knows how many years he has left? But with that body frame and if he takes care of himself he can still be there five years from now playing at a high level. But these guys are ready to play. I think as a team, as a perspective, once they get rid of the drama and get rid of the negativity that's around that was surrounding the team with Le'Veon Bell and all of these things. I think five years from now, this team will be better and Roethlisberger will be relaxed and the team will be good to go. 
- Alright, perfect segue, how about Le'Veon Bell and the Pittsburgh Steelers? 
- Well I think we saw a little bit of a sneak preview the last year right? You know, Bell was a Steeler 
- Not really. 
- But he really wasn't, so, we're gonna go with the Pittsburgh Steelers and obviously we're talking about James Conner, who filled in last year for Le'Veon Bell. We have another year with him now in the off season program and I think really where we're gonna miss Bell guys isn't as a rusher but as a receiver. But James Conner is a really good running back, he's productive between the tackles, he's a good pass protector. And again, another year of growing into the job I think Pittsburgh year in and year out does a great job of letting guys move on. I think the replacing Bell, I agree with Victor and I think they're gonna replace AB, and I think they're gonna replace Bell very well with James Conner. 
- Alright, I do think that team has sort of rallied around these departures. That's now, we'll see where they are in a few seasons. This last one, I don't even think you can count it as a breakup. I'm not sure they even really dated. I don't know, they went out. 
- It was a hookup. 
- It was a hookup, Josh Rosen and the Cardinals. 
- I think Josh Rosen is gonna be better off. Look, this kid had the weight of the world on his shoulders. He was a top draft pick, he was supposed to be the savior, the answer to the Arizona Cardinals organization. Of course, that didn't work out so here he is in Miami now. The pressure is really off. He's got a new head coach here, they're gonna be running a new England system. By the way, if you run the new England offensive system you've gotta be a smart guy. That's what Josh Rosen is. He's a smart guy and I think he's gonna fit in well there and it's gonna be a place. And by the way, he also had Fitzpatrick behind him who doesn't really seems to have the attitude of a starter that doesn't want to help. So, you have two smart guys in a quarterback room, it seems like that's a much better place for Josh Rosen to flourish. 
- But Diana, what about Kyler Murray, you don't think Arizona with Kyler Murray has a chance to be a dynamic play maker five years from now? 
- That's really what this question is right. Is an assessment of Kyler Murray in a lot of ways. 
- No it definitely is. Again, the big question mark of course is is it gonna work with Kliff Kingsbury. But to me, my biggest issue with Arizona, is last year and this year is their offensive line. So, as much as we can say Kyler Murray can-
- 
- I've got five years to fix it (laughter) 
- Try'na get rid of me? We got five years I'm just-
- 
- Breaking up is hard to do. 
- You gave us five years right? 
- I gave you five years I did 
- That's a lot of drafts. 
- Fair enough. Alright, when we come back Juju Smith-Schuster isn't thinking five years, he's thinking right now. And we'll talk roll models and Steeler's culture coming up. 
- Hi I'm Juju Smith-Schuster, and I'm gonna tell you how much fun I'm having this off-season.

- [Commentator] Leap and grab by the man called Juju. 
- [Commentator] Juju at the back of the end zone, wow! 
- We're joined this afternoon by Juju Smith-Schuster who's making his way all the way across the atlantic. He is in London this afternoon for the NFL Academy where he's an ambassador. Juju tell us exactly what that is and what it means there in London. 
- So here in London we're working with the NFL Academy. Which is an amazing thing because the opportunities to players. Young players from the age 15 and up. You know, who learnt the new game, American football. This is new to them. Which is awesome. But it's awesome because it just gives them the opportunity that they have another career, another goal that they can set to play in the states and to play NFL. 
- Juju we talked to James Conner yesterday, he talked about turning the page about the changes that had gone on in Pittsburgh during the off season. What's the temperature of this team as you get ready for training camp? 
- We're out in the 70, we're not too cold or we're not too hot, so, the weather is really nice right now. In our locker room everyone is on the same page you know. Focusing on the same goal. Which is amazing, because that's what we're all about. Is we're all about the team, there's no individuals and we're here to win games and win championships. 
- Juju talk to me about some of the talent you're seeing out there in London behind. Are there an Ballers out there, any future Steelers out there or what? 
- Oh man, there's some talent out here, some potential. I mean, you gotta understand, this game is new to them. You know, we started lifting weights at 14, these guys are barely starting at 16, 17. So if we were to get them on the right page on to the academy, that would be amazing to start a team. Eventually start their middle school, high school, and that would be their academy. 
- Alright Juju it's been well documented that Antonio Brown is no longer with the Steelers, now you're the number one guy. How does it feel? Do you feel a difference in the locker room? Are people treating you differently? Are dudes getting your lunch trays for you, like is it a different feeling being the number one guy? How does it feel? 
- Nah man there's no difference. I mean all the people used to say, you're the number one guy this year but more for myself man I just see it more opportunity for not just myself but for other guys to step up. You're talking about AB having a hundred catches over a thousand yards. Those yards, those catches are gonna be spread out you know obviously between James Conner, Vance McDonald, and James Washington, Donte Moncrief, a lot of guys, James Samuels. There are so many guys who are gonna get more touches, more catches, more yards, more yak. You know, just to help them individually. But at the end of the day I'm still the same dude, same Juju, same person, I'm just last year I was 21, this year I'm 22, same thing. 
- [Victor] That's what's up. 
- [Wendy] The 22 year old version of Juju Smith-Schuster, Juju you reference the football being spread around, that makes the communication with Ben Roethlisberger all that more important. What's your relationship like with your quarterback? 
- It's amazing man, you know what I mean, Ben he's a great leader, great dude, he's taken the whole offensive group down to his lake house in Georgia. Amazing, we spent time together bonding, we worked hard, we threw but at the end of the day it's more so like building that bond and that connection and what he did for us was amazing. I think it's so crazy that a guy who's been in the league for like 15, 16 years he sees so many guys come and go and you know for me I'm only 22 years old, when I met him I was 20 years old and our bond is just gonna keep growing. 
- I know as a athlete, as a super star athlete that you are you're always working on something new. You're always working on something new to perfect your game. Give me one thing you've been working on this off season to just either get better at or something you wanna add to your game, or whatever the case may be. 
- Man I've been really really focusing in playing more inside and outside and learning the whole package. Learning the whole offense, that's what separates being on the field the whole game than being on the field certain plays during packages. I think it's great that I'm able to play outside, inside, right side, left side, inside in. That's gonna help out a lot, that's something I've really been focused on, it's just studying that playbook till the next level and understanding what everybody has on the field. 
- Juju we also get to see everything else you do via social media. Does anybody in the NFL have more fun than you do? 
- Not necessarily, I mean I do lots of YouTube stuff there's a lot of stuff I do on that end. I really love to show my personal side. You know, my fun side, what I do in my free time, you know playing Fortnite. I do a lot of video-game streaming, Twitch, and making YouTube videos. I think a lot of guys in the NFL they just post a lot of working out videos, which is nothing wrong with that but what do they like to do on their free time? Do they like to travel the world? Do they like to just stay home watch movies? I think a lot of their fans would love to see that on a more personal base. 
- Well, and some like to go to prom you know. Which apparently you did recently. Tell us about the prom. 
- So the prom was awesome, you know. A kid, he's from PA Pittsburgh. Ideally he wanted to take this girl that he liked a lot and his best friend ends up taking her. He told his best friend too but his best friend kind of went behind his back, took his girl. So he asked me and I was just like, man let's just one-up this kid. We buy a suit, we get a party bus, we basically stole the night away from him and his girl but at the end of the day we all had a good time. I met the guy, he seems like a good kid, so he's great. My friend is great 'cause he got like 20k followers, Anthony. So he's super excited about his college career coming. 
- Anthony one, friend and girlfriend nothing, he wins. 
- Juju we saw you getting busy on the dance floor. We saw you getting busy on the dance floor right there. Talk to me about what celebrations you got in store. I know you're always being creative, you always bring some new stuff to the table. What you got in store for us this year from the celebration standpoint? Man so look, I'm super excited. Yes, I'm a young dude in a room but I'm very vocal, it's my time to step up, to be a leader and what I mean by leader, I'm getting everybody on the page to do major celebration Marlon McCree, he's older than me but he's gonna do these celebrations. James Washington. All these guys, major celebration. James Washington's on the same page because we're in the same class. And then I'm still working on Big Ben and Alejandro. They're a lot older than me so they've been there before so we'll see how it all figures out. But major celebrations coming soon. 
- All right, we can't wait. Last question, we asked James Conner this yesterday to close things out, why should Steeler fans be optimistic as we look toward 2019? 
- Man Steeler fans they're always here supporting since day one whether we're doing good or bad, I don't doubt those supporters to the end. I'm kind of happy where we're at right now, we're not the headline, the Browns, the team that everyone is watching what kind of noise they're gonna make. I'm super excited to watch them play too. Seeing OBJ comment on my post and I'm commenting on his post like, yo we can't wait who's gonna have the best dance moves but like I said this year the fans just support until the end because we're gonna finish strong. You always notice we always pull through. 
- [Wendy] Alright Juju, best of luck. We appreciate you being with us. 
- [Victor] Thanks for being with us Ju. 
- Thank you, I appreciate it. 
- [Wendy] With Antonio Brown now departed to Oakland, Juju will become Big Ben's number one option and he should receive tighter coverage. Over the last two seasons been facing press covers. Juju actually though had a better catch rate and yards for target than Antonio Brown. Clearly Victor perspective changes a little bit I would think. You know he's the number one guy, he can say whatever. What kind of pressure? How is it different for Juju starting this season than say last year? 
- I think the only thing different is like you said, the mindset, the perspective, obviously you're coming into that locker room and Antonio Brown is not there, it's just you and now you become kind of that leader. People are looking to you. You've been there, you understand who you are. I know you're just 22 years old but now you become the guy that the younger teammates are looking up to you wanting to know what you're doing, wanting to hang out with you in the off season. Wanting to just steal a little bit of knowledge from you. Your relationship with Ben. They wanna get a headstart on what they need to do to get better and he becomes the guy that leads the charge in that regard and it's pretty big shoes to fill. And I think the Steelers have done a great job. I think they were preparing for this for a number of years. And there is that whole notion of we have to win for today and develop for tomorrow. And you look at that position in that organization going back to Mike Wallace, Santonio Holmes, obviously Antonio Brown, Smith-Schuster. They do a great job of getting guys in the pipeline, getting them developed. And now Antonio Brown moves on, Smith-Schuster steps up to be the number one guy. I think they've done a remarkably great job for a number of years. Especially at this position. 
- I Think that's a great point, and I would argue that outside of New England, they probably do it as well as anybody in terms of continuity. I know Antonio Brown ended in a way they probably didn't anticipate but they did anticipate that it would end at some point. And to that end, and Mike to you your point, they seemed to be sort of in lockstep for planning for the future. 
- I think there's three things that Juju Smith-Schuster has to probably focus on this season. It's going from being a great receiver to an elite receiver. He needs to play at that level. Victor touched on the leadership aspect. It's obvious just from that interview you can hear he has stepped up to already be the leader. He's talkin' 'bout trying to get Big Ben in the offensive line to participate in his celebration drills. And they obviously have good chemistry there. And then that third layer is being a mentor to those younger guys. So he's gonna be asked a lot more of him as a football player out on the field and of course in the locker room, but if there's one thing I think we've learned about Juju over the years is he attacks everything with open arms. He is an open book himself, he embraces that role and he wants to be that character guy. He wants to be that good guy. And when you talk to players on the Steelers about Juju Smith and what his personality is like because obviously on social media he's so much fun and he can be loud, apparently he does a lot of his work silently. He's not the loudest guy in the room, he's not the one joking around during drills. He likes to have fun but he is locked in and focused and I think if he can take his game to that elite level the Antonio Brown conversations that we're gonna be having are gonna feel so long ago. 
- You know what else he said that was really impressive in the interview, he touched on at the end about the Steelers are always there in the end. And it's not where you start in football, it's where you end. And you look at Pittsburgh and New England, those teams always improve during the course of the season. So, James Conner, Smith-Schuster in a new role. It's not what they look like August or September. Are they ascending and getting better and Mike Tomlin deserves so much credit. The player development, the way they couch their players. They get better and I thought his point was a good one which is, hey, we'll be there in the end because that's where they've been year in and year out. 
- It almost feels like they transform and they kinda morph into whatever they need to be to win towards the second half of the season and that's what keeps them in the hunt year in and year out. 
- Well, and I understand for all kinda reasons why everybody's looking to Cleveland. But I think you'd unwise to sleep on Pittsburgh in any way, shape, or form. Mike Tomlin as the head coach, a veteran squad. This is a good team. I think that you could argue underachieved last season. We'll see. What do Patrick Mahomes, Sequon Barkley and Kyler Murray all have in common? They make head turning, highlight real worthy plays. We'll crown the highlight king next.

- [Diana] Great news. 
- [Wendy] Let's take a look at a few NFL players nominated for the ESPYS shall we? 
- After an impressive sophomore running through for over 5000 yards and 50 touch downs and won an MVP. Patrick Mahomes nominated for best male athlete. Sequon Barkley nominated for the best breakthrough athlete. Last season Barkley burst out of the scene rushing for 1307 yards. Broke a giant record. Kyler Murray nominated for best college athlete. He became the seventh to win the highest man in OU's history. None of those are too shabby alright? Today we give out the Highlight King award. Is that in ESPY or it's not? 
- It is not but-
- 
- Could be 
- It should be. 
- It should be. 
- It definitely should be but it's funny because my choice is Kansas city quarterback Patrick Mahomes. He is up for male athlete of the year 
- But you're crowning him the Highlight King. 
- He's getting my vote, and here's why. Against the Ravens, facing fourth and nine from the chiefs forward, Mahomes just did what we had seen him do countless times. Which was buy time with his feet. 
- [Mike] Get outta bounds. Relies on his right hand there, finds Tyreek Hill down field and the best part is after the game Andy Reid said, oh yeah that's exact how you decided. Yeah, sure Andy. How about against the Broncos? We knew his right hand was magical. Did you just say lucky? 
- [Narrator] Leftie. 
- Oh I thought you said lucky, I was like, I don't think that was luck right? We knew his right hand was pretty magical but his left hand here. Spots Von Miller comin right at him. 
- [Mike] Semi-spiral on that. 
- [Diana] Even when you're defense is doing everything they should be doing. There are situations where you cannot beat Pat Mahomes because he comes up with some unthinkable moments here. His athleticism, his vision of the field, and his ability to stay in the pocket plays and of course outside the pocket is where his perhaps probably most dangerous. 
- Alright I'm going with Sequon Barkley here. 
- [Wendy] Oh wait, he's your Highlight King just to be clear 
- He is my Highlight King Sequon Barkley because he is a highlight machine as you can see he's broken at least 47 tackles on that one to get to the end zone. In this one I mean, he's just putting his foot in the ground he will not be denied against Philadelphia obviously a rivalry in that division. And he's taken off on that one. In this one, this one's pretty good. Okay we know this guy is good. First of all tremendous block by 73 right there but this run is just indicative of the type of athlete that Sequon Barkley is. He can shake guys behind him, in front of him, and he's got the speed to outrun anybody in this league. And that's what we see here. And it's always on display. And then I get a bonus Diana, I get a bonus here like this one. That's a little hurdle, how many runner backs are doing that? Not only a handful of guys I can probably count 'em all on one hand who can hurdle guys in traffic like that and keep it moving. 
- (crosstalk drowns out speaker) 
- Protection two he was able to, not to pile on your Giants. But the fact that he was able to do that with that old Lion is incredible. 
- [Wendy] Mike Tannenbaum. 
- I got Kyler Murray, I was at this game, his resiliency was unbelievable, they got outplayed badly in the first half. He comes down in the second half, he steps up with the Pak he keeps his eyes down on the field, that puts so much pressure on a defense. Throws a really accurate pass. This was a great play. Got Oklahoma back in the game. This was another game I was at, West Virginia's defense was horrific in this game. If they were playing flag football, Tyler Murray still would've gone untouched. 
- [Victor] Looks like flag football. 
- And this is what Arizona was hoping for. Look at how many guys he can make miss in space and then have the speed to take it all the way. The amount of pressure he'll put on defenses will be formidable in the fall because it'll be his arm and his feet. Speaking of his arm, look at this one. Oklahoma state big rivalry game. Again, 50 yards out in the field Brown in stride. This guy's gonna be a dynamic play maker. He is a highlight machine, he is the Highlight King maker and Arizona Cardinals fans, that's what they're looking forward to in the fall. 
- They're hoping, fingers crossed. Listen, we told you we'd like to vote. We narrowed the field. It's one of these three Highlight King okay. So go to out Twitter handle @ESPNNFL, you can vote one of these three and we'll let you know what you think. Also, by the way, while you're at it don't forget you can also vote on the ESPYS right now, that is at ESPY.com Diana you already voted.

High school football coach Rob Mendez, who will be the recipient of the Jimmy V Award for perseverance. Born with an extremely rare condition that affects less than 100 people in the world. Mendez found his calling coaching a sport that he was never able to play himself. 
- Essy( featured chronicles, Mendez's first season as a head football coach. Capturing the inspiring and unlikely story of a coach who transformed a group of young athletes from skeptics into believers. 
- [Coach] At this time I just wanna introduce to you somebody that I think can really help turn this program around. A coach that I hired cause I was impressed with his knowledge of the game. His passion as a coach blew me away. Everything else that's on top of that, in terms of who he is and what he does on a day to day basis, inspires me. Your new coach, Rob Mendez. 
- It was awful, it was really really awful. I didn't have a choice to have an abortion so, I had to keep Robert. 
- In the back of mind I'm asking, why my son? You know, less than 100 born like him in the world. What am I gonna do with this boy. 
- It was hard to see him. I really didn't wanna see Robert. So I didn't see little Robert for about two weeks because I didn't know what to do. 
- I just remember staring, you know there was a lot of staring. It would piss me off really bad. Like he was not a human or something. 
- But he is different, he sees people staring as an opportunity. 
- Things that you an I get to do in ten minutes might take him an hour but he never complained about it. 
- Robert was just a really easy child and he just was really really happy. 
- What's your favorite team? San Francisco 49ers. 
- He's got a gift that doesn't require him to be physical. Making him aware of that, I think he just took the ball and ran. 
- I think the most difficult part about having no arms and no legs is simply not being able to play sports. I don't show it, I'm good at not showing it but I get mad. I get mad at God, I get mad at the Lord. Like why? 
- His freshman year, he was standing behind the fence at a distance watching the practice. That was the beginning. 
- We wanted to get him involved in the program so we invited him to be our manager. 
- They didn't know what I could do, they obviously knew I couldn't play but just to include me, it made me feel a part of it. You know, it made me feel, I guess you could say normal. 
- He paid attention to us as coaches but he learned the game playing Madden football. He created game plans on Madden and then he'd come to practice and try to create the same game plans and execute them the same way. 
- I started giving Robert a little bit more responsibility with my quarterbacks. And the next thing you know he was there running the drills for us. His ability to study the game and his ability to translate those things to the kids is unmatched by most of the coaches that I know. 
- I've been overlooked, the last three or four years I've been ready for it. When I go to a job interview sometimes I feel like I'm gonna scaring is not the right word, surprise them. And I don't know how they're gonna take the surprise. 
- As he rolls out, to be brutally honest, when I saw that I'm like how can this guy coach? And as he comes close he goes, give me a fist pump, give me a fist pump. I just gave him a little fist pump right there on his shoulder and all that nerves that I had just melted away. We had other applicants but I knew in my heart that it would be a great fit for these young athletes. 
- I remember when coach Kibble hired me, cruising off the campus I just felt really accomplished 'cause it took me so long I knew I've been ready for it and I've been overlooked. And finally somebody gave me the opportunity so I really appreciated that. 
- At this time I just wanna introduce to you your new JBL coach Rob Mendez. 
- Appreciate that coach Kibble Thank you coach. You know football is my passion, this is gonna be my 13th year coaching and I can't wait to get to know every single one of you. Believe in yourself, believe in your teammates, and believe in what you're doing. Are we clear gentlemen? I'm excited guys. 
- Obviously it was a little shocking and there was jokes coming around. Typical teenagers you know a guy with no arms or legs, not a lot of people have seen that. If you're taken aback that's just natural and that's human. But after the first two seconds, it's just a normal guy. 
- I don't care how good you are, I don't care how experienced you are, you guys are gonna do everything as a team. 
- Though he may not look like a coach, he definitely acts like one. 
- 9, 157, so what we're gonna teach right now is called 31 zone. 
- His knowledge of the game for somebody who actually hasn't gone through it is impressive. On his phone he can diagram a play faster than I can do it with pen and paper. 
- There's definitely doubters out there like parents. Look at him, my son is getting coached at quarterback by a guy who has no arms and no legs. That lights a fire under my butt and probably gets me excited to really just try to prove people wrong about it. Perfect! Good job! 
- When they see him and witness him, and hear him, I'd like to believe that they take a moment to evaluate themselves and anything that they've gone through in life can't be more difficult than what he endures on a daily basis. 
- One thing I care about more than anything is being a family, that is one thing I take pride on, I love people. I love you, I love you, I love you, I love everyone. So if you guys can't show love on this football field, then you better get off of it. Towards you Aden, who am I gonna go to? It was a fractured orbital bone and my cheekbone is fractured as well, I couldn't sleep, I couldn't chew. 
- I just felt bad for him. You know he's got a hard life and I try to make it as easy as I can. Things that you and I take for granted like brushing your teeth or washing your face or taking a shower or going to the restroom Robert needs someone to help him. But he's tough, two days later he was at his practice. And his thing is now I gotta be there for the kids. He's been waiting to be a head coach for a long time. 
- I didn't wanna let them down, I didn't wanna let the kids down. I just can't stay away I guess. Me being challenged has been my motivation. All I gotta say is, who says I can't!? 
- [Team] Nobody! 
- Who says I can't!? 
- [Team] Nobody! 
- Who says I can't!? 
- [Team] Nobody! 
- Who says I can't, originally came from me just having a drive to accomplish whatever people doubted me for. Who says I can't!? 
- [Team] Nobody! 
- Who says I can't!? 
- [Team] Nobody! 
- Who says I can't!? 
- [Team] Nobody! 
- Who says I can't!? 
- [Team] Nobody! 
- If he's willing to do all of that then what are we willing to do? 
- It's go time, we've been working hard all summer long. Prospect on three, one two three. 
- [Team] Prospect! Go kick ass, let's go. Those kids fought every single game, I mean I can't remember one game that we were bigger than the other team, but dammit we got the job done. That's what I'm talking about! We got the momentum keep it up, lets go! JBT in the last ten years has had mostly losing seasons. He just really has done a job that I haven't been able to see other coaches do at that level before. 
- I'm tryna send my Y over the middle because it's gonna be right here over the middle. Give me a hug both of you guys, appreciate guys, alright lets go. 
- [Announcer] Good morning and hello Prospect and Soprano High, winner today wins the league. 
- Remember this, I'm proud of every single one of you, but dammit we're not done yet, so let's go finish the job off right now. 
- [Commentator] Might take a miracle plan to score the only points in this contest. Passes off to his right, intercepted. 4-37 play in the fourth quarter. Soprano looking for the first points. Kick on the way, has the distance, and it's good and Soprano takes a 3-0 lead. 
- Let's just execute guys, this is four league right here, 180 smash okay lets do it. 
- [Commentator] Fourteen for the panthers, fourth down played Jackson off to his left and it's incomplete. Soprano gets the win and cakes the division title. What a win this afternoon over Prospect. 
- Don't worry about it, family is the most important thing remember that okay. That's what we built this team off of was family okay. You got good days and bad days man. Today as a team it's okay, I'm very proud of you, the whole team. It's gonna hurt today and that's okay if it hurts because we cared a lot. Because we love this game of football. I really sincerely want you guys to understand how much I appreciate this. You guys have given me a lifetime of memories. 
- Our opponents they'd always doubt him cause they see a man in a wheelchair, to us we see our coach who's perfect. 
- When we were pushing him off the field after the game, makes me feel proud to have him as my coach. 
- These kids would follow him no matter where he go. 
- You can actually see the changes in the kid. 
- Can I give you a hug? 
- You want the best for your children. I told him one time, there's not a lot of money in this Robert and he told me it's not everybody who does what they do for money. He's right. 
- They give me the feeling of importance and I don't think they know that and understand that. Maybe they will one day but I love those kids and I'm always gonna remember them. I think we make a perfect team, can we agree on that? 
- [Team] Yes coach. 
- Can we agree on that? 
- [Team] Yes coach. 
- Who says I can't!? 
- [Team] Nobody! 
- Who says I can't!? 
- [Team] Nobody! 
- Who says I can't!? 
- [Team] Nobody!

- [Commentator] Another golden moment from Wimbledon. 
- [Wendy] UFC 239 Saturday in Las Vegas, two of the greatest champions defending their titles. Jon Bones battles Thiago Santos and Amanda Nunes takes on Holly Holm in the co-main events on Pay-Per-View. That's starting at 10:00 Eastern. Go to espnplus.com/payperview. Juju Smith-Schuster will enter training camp as the Pittsburgh Steelers number one wide-receiver for the first time in his career. Here is Smith-Schuster from earlier today on what it's like on the expectations of stepping into that role. I mean all the people used to say, you're the number one guy this year but more for myself man I just see it more opportunity for not just myself but for other guys to step up. You're talking about AB having a hundred catches over a thousand yards. Those yards, those catches are gonna be spread out you know. Obviously between James Conner, Vance Donald, and James Washington, Donte Moncrief, a lot of guys, James Samuels. There are so many guys who are gonna get more touches, more catches, more yards, more yak. You know, just to help them individually. But at the end of the day I'm still the same dude, same Juju, same person, I'm just last year I was 21, this year I'm 22 same thing. 
- Yes, the older, wiser, more mature 22 year old Juju Smith-Schuster, with a good yak reference, always a good day. 
- Alright listen, this got us thinking obviously big shoes to fill with Antonio Brown deported. He's now an Oakland Raider. So, let's go one by one. Receptions, more or less, Antonio or Juju Mike? 
- Juju just made all my points for me. They're gonna spread the ball around in Pittsburgh, plus you have a head coach Jon Gruden who's the play caller, they gave up a lot of money and picks to get EB. EB will have more receptions. 
- I do think Jon Gruden motivated to get Antonio Brown the football. How about touch downs Diana? 
- Touch downs I'm gonna go with AB as well. You know you actually teamed me up perfectly there Wendy because I think if there is anyone that wants to make Antonio Brown work in Oakland, cause they have to figure out why the paid him all that money, it's gonna be Jon Gruden. So, he's obviously callin' all the shots on offense here and in terms of wide-receivers in the game, we can debate all long who is the best but we all know how special AB can be. And as soon as he can figure out that chemistry with Derek Carr I think he's gonna have more touchdowns than Juju does. 
- All right, there's receptions, there's touchdowns and how about all purpose yards Victor Cruz. 
- I'm gonna give Juju some love here because clearly Mike and Diana did not give him any love so far. But I'm going with Yards, he's the bona fide number one guy now which means in those pressure situations Ben will be looking to him to be that number one receiver and get him the ball in space either on drag routes, deep routes, he could run any route in the book, and it's gonna be interesting to see just how they use him as the number one guy. 
- All right look, it's a team game and all of those things are what they are. But what really matters of course, you hope anyway, are the number of wins from each of these teams. We've got the Steelers, we've got the Raiders. Who gets the head cheer?. 
- Yeah it's gonna be Pittsburgh. I think we're gonna see an improvement with Oakland, especially in offense. Josh Jacobs, Terrel Williams, obviously AB, another year with Derek Carr and Jon Gruden. Really worry about defense and rushing the pass but obviously they lost Cleo Mack a year ago, while they drafted Clelin Ferrell from the first round. It's gonna take a while for him to get going. I think they're gonna be a working progress in terms of how they are on defense. I'm going with Mike Tomlin and a very mature Pittsburgh Steeler organization. 
- I think that's a pretty good bet. How about celebrations? Is this even a question? Well I guess maybe. 
- It's not a question at all, I'm going with Juju mainly because it doesn't even have to be him that has to score to do the celebrations. He's made that clear, everybody is in on this thing, so whether it's him or whether it's Vance McDonald or any other person on that team. They're gonna be celebrating and Juju will be leading the way. 
- And let me tell you, if you did not see it, Juju was with us about an hour ago and he said that he is working on Ben Roethlisberger to get him on. He has not committed but he's trying. 
- We'll see him in there. 
- We'll see about that. 
- I like that you've become the resident celebration expert for us, it's like anything celebration that we have to go to Victor. 
- I am taking a bow for you. 
- We have one more category, one more category. How about the drama. 
- Oh the drama. 
- Is it on there or no? 
- Let's see here. 
- I guess not, alright pretend. Speaking of drama. 
- I'm gonna go with what history says and I think it's gonna be Antonio Brown on this and I'm gonna stick with that thought. I like the way Juju Smith-Schuster is maturing into not just a mentor to those younger players but an actual leader on the Steelers team. And for Antonio Brown there are a lot of personalities on this roster now. Obviously, we know Jon Bruden is the focal point of this team no matter who's on it. But I think there's going to be points during the season where the AB of Pittsburgh will show its face in Oakland. 
- You cannot tell, we will not get through this season without him getting irked with Derek Carr, there's no way. 
- It takes one sailed ball and he's gonna come at like, really, really? 
- Put some money on it. 
- The ESPYS are right around the corner, who is getting your vote for the best record-breaking performance. Come on, you know Drew Brees wants your vote.

- [Commentator] Drew Brees finds himself only 35 yards away. 
- It's about us, it's about our strength! 
- [Commentator] Just Peyton Manning left to pass, he starts in shotgun, drops back, looks to the far sideline. Wide open and Smith what a way to do it! 
- [Commentator] Drew Brees is the NFL's all time leading passer. 
- I won, how about that!? 
- [Commentator] There's only one word that comes to mind, greatness. 
- [Wendy] Well we continue to highlight some of the stars around the NFL that earned ESPY nominations this year. The amazing moment from Drew Brees is up for the ESPY for best record breaking performance. Brees broke the NFL passing record when he passed Peyton Manning's mark of 71,940 yards. And Victor you made this point yesterday and it's true. I think last year was his best bet at winning the MVP you just had this pesky little Patrick Mahomes who did things that just didn't seem possible to keep Brees from winning that award. 
- Exactly, and then how do you amass such a monumental record like this on an illustrious career that he's had and not win the league MVP one time. I mean obviously, probably Peyton Manning won a couple of those, Tom Brady, all of those tremendous players. But he's gotta get it one time, I mean he's put numbers up each and every year. I think there's years that he kinda just goes under the radar out there in New Orleans with those play makers and everybody he's got. I think this is the year where he's like, you know what I'm gonna put a nice pretty little red bow on this career and put a NFL league MVP under my belt and get back to the big dance hopefully and keep things going. 
- So, in fairness he has been a Superbowl MVP, two time offensive player 
- Ten years. 
- But the hall of fame quality quarterback Drew Brees' you would like to see him go. Although I know he'd take another Lombardi Trophy any day of the week. 
- Now that you can't dispute. But at least give him one League MVP, he's earned it. 
- We'll show you why how about this? How about the best of the best of Drew Brees. 
- [Victor] This is vintage right here. 
- [Wendy] Yeah vintage '04 he was a (speaks in foreign language). Play action, deep to Erick Parker, breaks a tackle for a 79 yard touchdown. 
- [Victor] I like it, showing that arm off. 
- [Wendy] In black and white there. 
- [Victor] Real early, real pixelated, grainy, I love it. 
- [Mike] Pixelated or something like that. 
- [Wendy] 2004 against the Packers. Three steps up, just glazed this one perfectly into the arms of Brandin Cooks, a 50 yard touchdown strike. 
- [Mike] You know what else is crazy? 
- [Wendy] That is a dime. 
- [Mike] He's stepping up in the pocket. A lot of times you see younger quarterbacks step up in the pocket and just check it out. He's stepping up in the pocket and keeping his eyes down the field put so much pressure on a defense. 
- [Wendy] '06 against the Bengals. The handoff here it's a flee flicker and then Joe Horn there between two defenders, a 72 yard touchdown and it's that kind of arm that we see on occasion. And that's Victor Cruz ass right there. On moving now to the modern day against the Panthers, Brees here to Ted Ginn in the end zone 49 yards. 
- [Victor] The consistency that we're seeing here is he's not even being touched, there are barely even people around him while he's making these throws. Like that's indicative to the type of team he's been around that offensive line taking good care of him. 
- [Wendy] '06 NFC Championship, Saints and Bears. Brees here to Reggie Bush. 
- [Mike] You know that's a great example of a really effective quarterback play. Sometimes you have to throw as hard as you can. That was a great touch throw. It led the running back who takes it all the way by what touch he has. And that's an underrated aspect of playing quarterback. 
- [Wendy] Then 2016 against the Raiders. The longest career pass, a 90... Is this a 98? Well he's got the... Little yards out to catch 
- [Victor] One yard back. 
- [Wendy] To Brandin Cooks. An incredible career, certainly should be featured on the hall of fame. Perhaps a future NFL MVP, you can vote in the ESPYS right now at ESPYS.com. Again, Brees up for record breaking performance along with three other moments including Klay Thompson's record for three pointers in a game with 14. Alright, we gave you our opinion but who are you crowning the NFL Highlight King? Is it Mahomes, Sequon, Kyler, Dennis Green? Let us know what's happening next. 
- Now, if you wanna crown 'em, then crown their (beep), but they are who we thought they were.
