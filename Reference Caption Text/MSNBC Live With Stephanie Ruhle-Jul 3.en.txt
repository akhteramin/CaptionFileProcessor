- Right back at y'all. 
- All right, we've got 30 seconds. Final thoughts, Walt. 
- You know, Fourth of July. Think about it, look at the pictures. Read the Declaration of Independence. Remember what the Fourth of July is about and the values that we hope to uphold. 
- Kareen? 
- I was thinking the same thing. We should not be politicizing tomorrow, Fourth of July. It's a day of independence, it's a day of really knowing who we are and remembering who we are. 
- We celebrate Fourth of July in the midst of a serious moral crisis which speaks to the character of the country. What will we do; who will we be? 
- Meanwhile, the president just on Twitter said tomorrow will be, The show of a lifetime in Washington. That does it for us this morning. Have a great Fourth. Chris Jansing picks up our coverage right now. 
- Quite a note to end on, Willie Geist, thank you so much. I am Chris Jansing, in for Stephanie Ruhle, and we begin with literal cries for help from migrants detained at the southern border, fresh documentation directly contradicting what the Trump Administration has said that in fact show squalid conditions at migrant centers and that it's even more widespread than we knew. These disturbing and dangerous situations detailed in a new report from Homeland Security's own inspector general after surprise visits to multiple facilities in the Rio Grande Valley. Those visits in June revealed children without hot meals, not allowed to shower, detainees wearing the same clothes for up to a month, adults given only bologna sandwiches to eat, causing health problems. Inspectors said that when detainees saw them, they banged on cell windows and held up signs, desperate for release. One of those signs said, Help, 40 days here. That would violate a federal court order that migrants be held no more than 72 hours. A senior manager at one of the facilities described the entire situation as a ticking time bomb. Our award-winning immigration reporter Jacob Soboroff has seen some of these border facilities with his own eyes, but, wow, this report was, even though we knew so much, shocking to see it all there in one place. Your reaction to this new report, which cites immediate health and safety concerns, not at one or two, but seven different sites. 
- Yeah, Chris, you just read, I think, what I believe to be the key phrase, that this thing was a ticking time bomb. And this is not just a phrase that can be used to describe the conditions in those seven facilities in the Rio Grande Valley. The facility that I've been inside is that central processing station there in the Rio Grande Valley where they separated more kids than anywhere else along the southern border. They called it the epicenter. A ticking time bomb can be used to describe the entire way that the Border Patrol has been detaining migrants for decades. These are prisons, jails, and they treat migrants as if they were prisoners, as if they were criminals coming into this country. They've always been set up as a system of intake, jail processing-type stations, where nobody's supposed to be there for longer than 72 hours. And it was only a matter of time before they were going to see another surge like they did and like they are seeing along the southern border today. And what happens when you have tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people coming into the country and are being placed into tiny little jail-like facilities that are designed for single adult males to be there for an abbreviated period of time, it's exactly what we're seeing in this DHS OIG report about the RGV sector, and it's exactly what Julia Ainsley and I reported about what has been going on in El Paso just a couple days ago. 
- Yeah, so, a couple of weeks ago was when this report was done, this inspection was done. And at the time, the DHS said that it required immediate attention and action, so it sounds like, at least in some instances, there are no major changes in the last couple of weeks. Is that your read? 
- The conditions are not gonna get better quickly in these facilities when it comes to the facilities themselves and the infrastructure that's down there. I mean, that's the conversation that's going on right now, particularly amongst the Democrats: What do you do about the ways that this country is holding migrants when they come into this country? But I will say, if there is any bright spot in all of this, just a couple months ago, there were over 2,300, Julia Ainsley reported this yesterday, 2,300 migrant children in the custody of Customs and Border Protection in facilities just like this. As of yesterday, there were only a couple of hundred and they've been moved to facilities that are operated by HHS in other areas, not just of the southwest border but across the country. It doesn't mean that the facilities are getting any better. It means that the children, for now, have been moved out, in large part, at least according to what Julia has learned from CBP. 
- Yeah, I saw one report that a baby was being held in one of the places that was really cold and actually their hands and feet had turned blue, so obviously there are some serious problems here. Jacob, you're gonna stay with me. I wanna also bring in Washington Post White House bureau chief Phil Rucker, Rick Tyler, a Republican strategist and co-founder of Foundry Strategies, Doug Thornell is a former DNC senior advisor and principal at the political consulting firm SKDKnickerbocker. So, Phil, we've now seen multiple reports from Trump's own administration citing these terrible conditions. Is it changing the conversation in the West Wing at all? 
- Not much, Chris. What we've not seen from the administration and from the president himself is real moral leadership on this or a focus on the humanitarian crisis. Rather, there's a focus on the numbers, how many people are crossing the border, how many people are being detained. We're hearing from officials in the administration that those numbers have been declining in recent weeks from a high in May. But we've not seen the president really forcefully take control of this issue and talk about the humanitarian crisis that we see playing out that's so well-documented in that IG report and in the reporting from people like Jacob. 
- And it's a humanitarian crisis, Rick, that is unfolding in the middle of an election season. But even DHS responded to this new report by saying Congress's failure to act is incentivizing illegal migration. But do you believe anything will change between now and the election or has this issue just become too politicized? 
- Well, Chris, I'd like to step back and put it in context. This is a massive political failure that has occurred over decades of time, and both parties are to blame. And I realize a Republican administration is in charge now, but, look, I agree with Chairman Nadler that someone needs to be held accountable, but I wanna be very careful. Yes, we need to weed out the bad apples, but I wanna be very careful about demonizing the Border Patrol, 'cause the problem is these facilities that the Border Patrol is working with are not designed to hold families and a number of people and especially children for the time they're doing it. And so, I have to say the bottom line is if we are ill-equipped to treat immigrants humanely, then I would be for letting-
- 
- Well, it's not 'if', is it? It's not if. You can look at these pictures, Rick, and say they're not being treated humanely. They're being told to drink outta toilets. Kids are freezing. 
- Here's what I would say. And if I were a member of Congress, I would be saying, We need to release the majority of these people today. Maybe people who are known to be dangerous would stay in detention, but the majority of these people need to be released today because we cannot tolerate a country that we are treating people so inhumanely. 
- Well, I mean, we have 11, 11, Doug, of the candidates for president are members of Congress, but that ignores the fact that ultimately the buck stops with the president, and it is the president who put policies in place that led us to where we are right now. 
- Yeah, this report is alarming, it's shocking. A lotta the images we've seen are alarming and shocking. And I think it just highlights how big of a failure this White House's immigration policy is. From top to bottom, it's not keeping us safer and it's inhumane. And I think what we're gonna see from Democrats over the next few weeks, I think there's gonna be a hearing next week in the Oversight Committee where the CPB head will come and testify. Democrats have also requested hundreds if not thousands and thousands of documents from this administration on their immigration policies, and they've been met with no, and the administration has refused to turn over a lotta this paperwork. So, when the administration blames Congress, they're not cooperating with Congress so that Congress can help solve this issue with this administration. So, the buck definitely stops with Trump, and they're definitely doing everything they can to stonewall here. 
- Yeah, in the meantime, we just got, on Twitter, from the acting DHS secretary, Jacob, he just posted that he's launching an investigation into those Facebook postings of the group of former and current border agents. What do you know about that? 
- Well, what's gonna happen here is another Office of Inspector General investigation, the same types of investigations that have revealed the horrid conditions in these Border Patrol stations. And to hear that from Kevin McAleenan is certainly reassuring. But don't forget: Kevin McAleenan also called conditions inside these facilities unsubstantiated as recently as last Friday. So, I think it's important that the department's gonna look into this. When you hear a culture of 9,500 Border Patrol agents in a secret Facebook group, this was some extraordinary reporting from ProPublica, talking in the way that they were, it's hard not to give credence to the allegations that we hear coming out of these facilities. We've heard the reports from the Democratic lawmakers who were down there earlier this week. I've seen certain conditions down there with my own eyes. And again, it's a positive step, I suppose, but it's certainly not gonna alleviate what is happening, as Rick said, right now down there. 
- Yeah, and we just got a report, I guess in the last 24 hours or so, Jacob, that a young girl, I guess, or a two-year-old apparently drowned in the Rio Grande after we saw that heartbreaking picture of a father and his child. 
- Yeah. Again, this is another horrific story of a family who just wanted to escape their lives where they were to come for a better life. This reportedly was a Haitian national with a child who was a Brazilian national crossing the Rio Grande. They were separated in the river and a search is ongoing right now by the Border Patrol. If it turns out that this child did not survive, I want everybody to remember that 7,000 people have died trying to come into this country since 1998. The failures of our border policy as Americans have been systemic literally for decades in Democratic and Republican administrations. No one has treated migrants more inhumanely, and take it from me who's seen it myself, than the Trump Administration, but this is a problem that has been festering literally for decades. And now, finally, as far as I'm concerned, it's refreshing, it's reassuring to hear all of us debating how we fix it so that this does not continue to happen. 
- Yeah, well, depends on who the 'we' is, because the president's actually doubling down. So you have-
- 
- There's no doubt about that, Chris. 
- Children who are dying, right, you have these pictures of people being held in, reports that there are adults who are literally in cells that are so tightly packed that they can't sit down, they are standing-room-only for a week at a time. And yet, he's signaling more detentions after tomorrow, imposing fines on undocumented migrants who don't show up for court. Phil, I was thinking back to when the First Lady went down at the time of the family separation and some people thought, Well, maybe the First Lady and Ivanka will impress upon him the inhumanity of what's happening down there. But is there any scenario that you see, having covered this president, that suggests to you that he will shy away from this as a campaign issue? 
- Not at all, Chris. I mean, this is an issue that the president believes is a winning issue for him politically. He believes that his tough stance on illegal immigration is what got him the presidency in the first place, it's what helped him defeat all those other Republican challengers in the 2016 primaries, and he believes it's what's gonna win him reelection. It's why you hear him talk about it at every single rally. And his advisors say that they hope this issue stays in the headlines for every day between now until Election Day. And so, the First Lady can try to put a spotlight on the humanitarian issue, although we've not seen or heard anything from her in the last few weeks here, and Ivanka Trump can talk about what she wants to talk about, but the president believes that this is how he wins reelection. 
- Jacob Soboroff, thank you so much for your continuing reporting. Everyone else, you're coming back, so I'll see you soon. 
- Thanks, Chris.

- We are now exactly seven months away from the Iowa Caucus, as Democratic candidates are well aware. Seven of the contenders are barnstorming the state today, while the latest Iowa poll is released, mimicking what we've seen in national polls since the debates. Kamala Harris is surging in Iowa, jumping into second and closing in on frontrunner Joe Biden. Elizabeth Warren also got a post-debate bump, while Bernie Sanders dropped to single digits. Our road warriors are out across the state: Shaquille Brewster in Iowa City, Vaughn Hilliard in Des Moines, Garrett Haake in Sioux City. So, Shaq, on one hand, Bernie Sanders had a strong fundraising quarter. I read that more than 800 people turned out for his rally yesterday in Iowa City, yet he is dropping, not just in Iowa but nationally. Is there any indication his campaign is switching strategy? 
- Well, his team is saying that they are focusing on the strategy of slowing building this campaign from the ground up. And, of course, his team is pointing to an ABC poll that came out this morning that shows his support actually increasing, ticking up just a few points. His campaign manager had a video briefing with supporters or for supporters last night, and in that briefing, he said there'll be peaks and valleys, but that they're going to stay the course. But if you look at this trip to Iowa that Senator Sanders is doing, you notice a couple of subtle shifts in his strategy. Number one, his focus on retail politics. So, there's not gonna be as many rallies or traditional rallies that he has. He's having ice cream socials, though, as you probably saw last night, he still gives long speeches at those ice cream socials, but he's also gonna be marching in Fourth of July parades, trying to meet with Iowans and shake their hands and enjoy this holiday with them. But number two, he's also gonna be focusing on his ground game. The campaign is opening three new offices in the state of Iowa. They're also going to be highlighting their volunteer force. They're trying to show that they have this grassroots support that can deliver him to victory come February 3rd and come that caucus time. So, they're focusing not only on those rallies, but also activating their supporters and getting them out there, as many candidates are here and focused on getting those Iowa voters. 
- Vaughn, the debate has catapulted Kamala Harris, who you're with, into serious contention, but we also know, history tells us that debate bounces can be short-lived. Have you seen any adjustments to her campaign to capitalize on this? And then, I also wanna know about her fundraising, 'cause we know she made $2 million in 24 hours, but we haven't seen her quarterly numbers. 
- Yeah, we haven't seen the quarterly numbers yet. The campaign tells us that they expect to release those in the next couple days. But in those first three days after her debate performance, the campaign raised more than $3 million in just online donations. She had multiple fundraising events over in California where she raised an additional $600,000, the campaign tells us. And you asked the question, What is the position of this campaign right now coming outta the debate. And, well, the reality here in Iowa is they now have 65 staffers, paid staffers here on the ground in Iowa. They looked at that debate as an opportunity, as being more than a debate bump, but as an introduction of Kamala Harris to the country. They believe that this summer was that moment when people would start paying attention. We are now, as of today, seven months away from that Iowa Caucus. And I asked Kamala Harris, I was with her over in California over the weekend, I asked her on Sunday how she looked at approaching this campaign going forward and whether she was going to take a measured approach in continuing, as she would suggest, prosecuting the case against her Democratic opponents. And she wavered in her answer there, not answering directly. And I followed up saying, Will you continue to draw contrasts from your Democratic opponents? And she was not eager to respond to that question. But when it comes to the operation they have on the ground, they're in place and she's gonna be here over the next three days. 
- All right, Garrett, a number of other candidates are there today. Money and polls, two big things. And I do always find it interesting when the deadline comes that some candidates, usually the ones who have a great quarter, get out there ahead of everything and then the rest lag behind. Any suggestion on when we'll see some of these other numbers, and what are they waiting for? Beto O'Rourke seemed to suggest yesterday he had no idea how much money he had raised in this last quarter. 
- Yeah, I don't buy that for one second, Chris. I'm sure that he may not know the exact total, but these campaigns watch their fundraising numbers probably closer than they watch their polling numbers. The candidate would know whether or not they're on track to hit their quarterly goals or not at the very least. A lotta this is news cycle management. You'll remember even, with O'Rourke as an example, in the first quarter, his campaign waited and held their numbers over a weekend. I don't remember the news event, I think it was a terrorist attack that had happened on a Thursday or a Friday or something of that nature. They decided not to release 'em 'cause they didn't want it to get caught up in the wash or look like they were bragging. So, let's look at the calendar for the next few days. If you're somebody who might wanna brag about your fundraising numbers, today's probably your last chance to do it for a while. So, perhaps somebody like a Joe Biden could be potentially releasing their numbers early, but you get caught up in this holiday weekend. And for somebody who'd like to bury those numbers if they were disappointing, not what you wanted 'em to be, Fourth of July, 5 p.m., great time to release your fundraising numbers. Now, as to Iowa itself, we do have a ton of candidates here today. O'Rourke is here, Biden is here, Klobuchar is here. I'll be covering a Mayor Pete Buttigieg event later on tonight. The bottom line with Iowa is it is still the place to go where you can move your poll numbers with retail events, where being on the ground is thought of to be the best way to make a difference. And part of this is 'cause of these folks that I've been calling super-voters, the folks who come to every event. And you see them in all the early states, but particularly in Iowa, you meet these folks who take their roles so seriously. Listen. Simply naming them all can be a feat. 
- Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar. 
- Kamala Harris was there, Bernie Sanders, Julian Castro, and Jay Inslee. 
- Tim Ryan, John Delaney. 
- Eric Swalwell, the Williamson lady, O'Rourke. 
- The list goes on. But for the super-voters of the early states, meeting and questioning the Democratic candidates is a duty and a privilege. How many of the Democratic candidates have you gone to see so far? 
- I think Biden will be 12. 
- Yes. 
- Voters in Iowa see the most of the candidates, with more than 150 total events held in the state in the month of May alone. That gave Carol McGuire time to meet nine candidates. 
- I would love to see all 25. I'll travel wherever we have to go. 
- [Garrett] Some super-voters have a cause. 
- When I started in 2016, I was so angry. 
- [Garrett] Brenda Bouchard lost her husband to Alzheimer's. She's asked 30 candidates about their plans to fight the disease over the last two campaigns. 
- Ultimately, my ideal outcome would be that a candidate would put out a policy around Alzheimer's. 
- [Garrett] Some super-voters are semi-professionals. Anthony Geron in Nevada is an activist with a group called Make the Road. 
- I wanna be as educated as possible. I don't wanna be caught off-guard. 
- The ACLU trained Kevin Leuters, who comes to events with a list of questions. What's your method to getting a candidate to answer your question? 
- Well, to corner them. Usually, if there's a Q&A session, my arm goes up quicker than anybody else's. 
- (laughing) The fastest draw in the West? 
- The fastest draw in the West. I've been trained well. 
- [Garrett] Marc Korver has no trouble catching a candidate's eye for a chance to get a signed baseball and to get close to history in the making. 
- To me, that's more important, you personalize yourself, 'cause sometimes people think presidents being larger than life. This makes them, I say it brings out a more human side. 
- [Garrett] For all of these super-voters, picking presidents is a participatory sport. Watching a debate isn't enough; they want to shape it. 
- I'm one of many voices. But if I have a voice here in New Hampshire, I'm going to use it to the best of my ability to try to make a change. 
- Chris, technology has changed the game here too. The ease of shooting a video of your interaction with a candidate, posting it on social media, has given these super-voters even more power to shape the narrative, shape the discussion in these races. 
- Garrett Haake, who's braving the rain for us this morning in Sioux City, Vaughn in the sunshine, and Shaq's near a coffee pot, so you tell me who's got it going on. Thank you, gentlemen, appreciate it. And up next, the legal battle over President Trump's tax returns escalates to a whole new level, with Democrats following through on a potentially game-changing threat.

- This is a legal alert for users of Roundup weedkiller. Roundup has been designated as a probable human carcinogen by the World Health Organization. In July 2018, a judge determined that all federal lawsuits could move forward against Monsanto, the maker of Roundup weedkiller, over concerns that those exposed are at risk for developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Landscapers, those who work in the landscaping industry, farmers, and heavy exposure residential users where Roundup weedkiller is used are at risk for developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Roundup weedkiller is the most commonly used weed killer in American agriculture, with an estimated 85 to 90 million pounds used each year. If you or someone you love has been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma after being exposed to Roundup or a glyphosate herbicide, you may be entitled to compensation. How do you fight for the compensation you deserve? You choose the right legal team that has the experience and resources to seek the most compensation for your injuries. Call now. 
- [Announcer] You save. 
- Now to that big escalation in the Congressional Democrats' fight to see President Trump's taxes. The House is suing the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service over his returns after their requests and then subpoenas of the returns was ignored by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig. So, the federal courts now get the case, which could ultimately be fought in the Supreme Court. I'm joined now by Charlie Savage, a New York Times reporter who has been covering this for months and is also an MSNBC contributor, David K. Johnston, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who has written multiple books on the president and his administration. He is an expert on tax issues and has been looking into the president's returns for years. 
- So, Charlie, in the lawsuit, the committee claims that the White House's refusal to comply with their subpoena is, and I'm quoting here, An extraordinary attack on the authority of Congress to obtain information needed to conduct oversight of Treasury, the IRS, and the tax laws. So, what are the questions here for the judge, who could obviously order the defendants to comply? 
- That's right. Well, the question here is whether the broader Trump strategy of stonewalling Congress, which is to say that all of its requests for oversight information are illegitimate, will withstand judicial scrutiny. The Trump Administration has been fighting all subpoenas and requests for information ever since the House was taken over by Democrats six months ago by saying that Congress only has authority to request information if it's thinking about how to write a new law and it doesn't have authority to request information to uncover wrongdoing, and that even when it says it's trying to write a new law, like in this case, the Executive Branch can second-guess that and say, That's just a pretext; this is really about exposing information for political purposes. That's outside your authority and you can't do that. Two courts have already rejected that argument at the District Court level for subpoenas by Congress to financial firms for Trump Organization records. Now, a third judge will get a crack at it, and this is the first one coming from Congress itself. 
- So, here's part of the White House statement. Chairman Neal's willingness to use his powerful committee to go after his political opponents is a danger to democracy. The committee has no legitimate legislative purpose for which is can demand the president's tax returns, and it is evident that they are only interested in partisan games. So, Charlie, is this partisan? What could be in those returns that would be of interest to Congress? 
- Well, is it partisan? I mean, you'd have to be utterly naive to think this is not political. Of course it's political. The question is just whether it's within Congress's authority to do it regardless of its motive. On the face of it, the law says Congress, this committee, can request any individual's tax returns, period. It doesn't set a limit. And so the executive branch is kind of inventing one, and we'll see whether a judge goes along with that. But why would they want it? They've said in other occasions that they want to see these returns because every president until now has released his returns and they wanna enforce that tradition. They wanna see what kind of financial dealings Trump has that may have run afoul of the Constitution's bar on receiving emoluments from foreign governments. They wanna see what his business entanglements with China and with Russia and with other governments that he might have foreign policy decisions about are. And they wanna see what the president's financial health is and whether it lines up with what he claims it is on the scale. So, there's all kinds of reasons that they want to see these and they clearly also wanna make them public. 
- But, David, what they wanna put out there is that the reason they don't think they should turn them over is kind of protecting the office, not protecting something that might be in there that would lead to problems for the president. Tell us, in that context, what you know about the president's returns and what might be in there. 
- Well, all of the arguments that are being made by the administration are simply cover for hiding Trump's tax returns. And the argument that the court's going to hear is that Trump himself has made the case that there is a legitimate legislative purpose. He has complained that he's being excessively audited by the IRS. He claimed recently he's being audited because he's a Christian. He claims that he's being treated differently than other presidents. So, he, with his own words, has made the case here that Congress should be looking at this as part of its oversight of the Internal Revenue Service. And in the history of this law, which was enacted in 1924, there has not been until now a single case that there's any record of of the IRS not turning over information when requested. In fact, the Joint Committee on Taxation has three staff members who work in the IRS building because they review tax returns every day of the week. 
- So, Mick Mulvaney, Trump's acting chief of staff, has said that the Democrats will never see Trump's returns. David, it sounds like you wouldn't place a bet on that. 
- They will see Trump's tax returns. Now, if this isn't settled by the end of this Congress, the clock will have to restart with new litigation, but we will eventually see Trump's tax returns, no question about it. And in addition, the New York State Legislature and the governor have signed legislation that provides to the Ways and Means Committee and other congressional tax-writing committees the New York State information from Trump's tax returns. People watching this shouldn't forget, Trump won't even release the audit letter, an absolutely anodyne document that would say if he's under audit. He claims he's audited ever year. The only individuals who get audited every year are people the IRS has strong reason to believe are tax cheats, but they haven't managed to nail the case yet. 
- So, to David's point really quickly, Charlie, when might we get us something on this? When might this all be settled? Could it indeed go past 2020? 
- Oh, easily. So, a district court judge has to look at it. Assuming Trump loses, he'll appeal. An appeals court will have to look at it. Then whoever loses that will appeal to the full appeals court. And then whoever loses that will appeal to the Supreme Court. It's very easy to see this dragging on for a long time. On the other hand, those two cases I mentioned earlier involving subpoenas to private financial and banking firms holding Trump Organization records, the first-line judges who looked at both of those cases moved them very quickly. In a matter of weeks they said, No, Trump is wrong, and ordered the firms to comply, and then Trump appealed. So, it's possible that judges can choose to move this along and not let it be dragged out. But for now, it's clearly the strategy of the Trump legal team to just buy time and stall. 
- Charlie Savage, David K. Johnston, great to see both of you, thank you. And up next, as tanks roll into the nation's capital ahead of tomorrow's festivities, why some former military officials are expressing concern about President Trump's controversial Fourth of July celebration.

- So, here's the promise that President Trump is tweeting this morning. He'll give the US, The show of a lifetime, at tomorrow's expanded July 4th celebrations in Washington. Well, here's one look at how that's coming along. Politico's Heather Caygle tweeted that a crane had to be used to move a tank after the flatbed truck transporting it was unable to clear an overpass. We have new images as well of the tanks stationed around the Mall, including the Lincoln Memorial, where President Trump will give his address. There are also reports that the cost of the extravaganza, an event the president has wanted for two years now, will balloon far beyond the usual $2 million for a DC Fourth of July, and the higher cost will mean less money for national parks. The Washington Post reports the National Park Service has diverted $2.5 million in fees to cover some of the costs. NBC's Monica Alba joins us now from the National Mall with more. Hey, Monica, we're just a day away. We know that the Pentagon has been scrambling to get together on short notice what the White House is asking for. What are you seeing on the ground? 
- Exactly, Chris. As you can see right here next to me, these are actually two Bradley Fighting Vehicles. This is just some of the military might that is expected to be on full display tomorrow night here, of course, on the National Mall right behind me. And this is just some of an example. You mentioned, of course, they were moved overnight on trains and then flatbed trucks because these tanks are exactly so heavy. And of course, this is the president, he fell in love with this two years ago in Paris on Bastille Day and wanted to recreate it. But a lot of critics are questioning whether he's gonna be able to kind of keep this event that is typically nonpartisan partisan, whether he's going to go into more of a campaign mode. Asked to kind of preview what speech he's gonna give and whether it's gonna be able to unify all Americans, he said, I think so, but in the same answer he also talked about the healthcare plan that the Democrats have put forward destroying the country, so that's a little bit of a fine line. Now, everything here is still open. You can see, of course, this other Bradley Vehicle and the Lincoln Memorial. So, tourists are here, it's just another hot summer day. Tomorrow, this will look a little different though, with many people expected on the Mall. Chris? 
- Monica Alba, thank you for that. Phil Rucker is back with me, as well as highly-decorated retired Army Colonel Jack Jacobs, a Medal of Honor recipient and MSNBC military contributor. So, Phil, your paper reports, This year's gathering on the Mall marks a departure because presidents have not traditionally participated in the nation's Independence Day celebration. So, why Independence Day if you're gonna do a military parade? What are you hearing about how this all came about, 'cause it was all pretty fast? 
- Yeah, Chris, well the president wanted to do a military parade and those plans actually were thwarted, in part by the DC government over concerns about cost and just infrastructure problems with rolling tanks through the streets of a city. And so, the parade was not to be. The president seized on this July 4th moment as a chance to put his own mark on what has historically been a decidedly nonpartisan celebration in the nation's capital. He's wanted to have bigger fireworks than normal. He's wanted to put himself at center stage. He's given out VIP tickets to his political donors. And meanwhile, it's being funded by the government, not by his campaign. And, in fact, my colleagues at the Post have reported last night that $2.5 million in national park entrance fees, these are the fees that you pay when you go to visit Yosemite or Yellowstone or any of these national parks, that that money has been diverted away from the parks to help fund tomorrow's celebration. 
- There are, Colonel Jack, as you know, military parades around the world, which, again, as Phil pointed out, was originally what the president wanted. Russia has Victory Day, Iran, National Army Day, we mentioned that he was at Bastille Day, which is kind of where he got the idea that he wanted this. But do you share the concerns that we've heard from some former military officers who say, Look, you've got to keep this stuff apolitical, and it clearly is not? 
- Yeah, I do, and people I talk to do as well. We've had a long history and tradition of having an apolitical Fourth of July celebration. We're celebrating the founding of the country, not celebrating our military might. The thing that concerns me the most is the fact that we don't have to show our military might. There are tank countries and there are non-tank countries. We are a non-tank country. Iran is a tank country, North Korea is, Russia, China. Those are all tank countries. We don't have to demonstrate. Matter of fact, it's part of our strength that we don't have to demonstrate our strength in this way. And the conclusion that one draws is that this is merely a, it's not even a thinly-veiled campaign event. It looks exactly like a campaign event. And it panders to the least savory of all of our political notions, Chris. 
- Well, the other thing, I think, that we're seeing here a little bit, Phil, is that this is, in some ways, not unlike the president tweeting he'd like to meet Kim Jong-un at the DMZ and then there's this big scramble, right? The new press secretary gets caught in the middle of it and all these things have to be done at the last minute. Sounds like that's the same thing that happened to the Pentagon in this case. 
- Yeah, Chris, part of what's going on here, I think, is that the president himself is trying to produce this event. Remember, his background is in putting on reality television shows. He cares intensely about the staging of his political rallies, about what goes where, about what equipment would be involved. And he's been very hands-on in the last few weeks in putting together the plans for the Fourth of July on the Mall. 
- Wait just a second. Colonel Jack, does it bother you, with everything that is going on in the world, multiple nuclear threats among them, that this is how the president is spending his time? 
- Well, of course it's bothersome. Look, he's not alone. All presidents are always campaigning, always have been. But this is really in-your-face and it's clear that his focus is less on the kinds of things that keep us free than things that look like they keep us free. The decision-making, you just have to go back a couple of weeks and take a look at the paucity of intelligent and strategic decision-making that has taken place just in the last few weeks, with Iran being aggressive in the Gulf, the attacks on the ships there, what's taken place in Iran now, plussing up its nuclear capability. No response from the United States to speak of. Same thing in North Korea. China is spreading out across the South China Sea, and so on. There are lots and lots of things we need to do with our military; this isn't one of 'em. 
- Colonel Jack Jacobs, always good to see you. Happy Fourth. And to you, Phil Rucker, as well. Thanks, guys. 
- Thank you. 
- Up next, it might not come as a surprise that polls show Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris getting a bump after their debate performances, but a new analysis shows exactly where their gains are coming from.

- This morning, a new Washington Post/ABC poll shows that while Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren both did get a boost from strong debate performances, Joe Biden still leads. And that lead has diminished, though he remains at the top of every single national poll we've seen since the debates. And this morning, we may know why. It goes beyond Iowa and beyond the nomination. 45% of voters think that he is the candidate who can beat Trump in the general election. Joining me to weigh in, Liz Alarcon, founder of Pulso, a social media organization dedicated to top issues affecting Latino-Americans. Rick Tyler and Doug Thornell are back with me. Doug, do you think it's that simple? Biden is still in the lead because he's viewed as more moderate and Democrats think he can win in the general? 
- Well, I think it's also because he's got a broad coalition of support. African-Americans have been a base of his support since he started. He's doing well with older voters. He's doing well with moderate voters. So, he's got a broader coalition. I think, depending upon what polls you look at, they're saying different things, so I would just be cautious about interpreting them too much until maybe a couple weeks after the debates have passed. But clearly-
- 
- Well, let me show you something though, 'cause this is interesting, because FiveThirtyEight did something really smart. They took a group of voters before the debates and polled them, and then they did one after the debate. So, you actually see how the debates really moved things. Look at this. The big winner, clearly, Kamala Harris, up 9.4%. Julian Castro, Elizabeth Warren also gaining. But look at Joe Biden, down 6.8%, Beto O'Rourke, Pete Buttigieg also losing ground there. What do you make of that, Liz? 
- I would say that there are several polls that we should be looking at. The Univision poll that came out yesterday that surveyed Latinx voters showed that Kamala Harris went up from sixth place up to first and Julian Castro also had a big jump. He's now in second place among those Latinx voters that were surveyed. And we know that the Latinx community is going to be the largest minority voting bloc in 2020. 
- [Chris] How do we know that? How do we know that? 
- Well, many studies from Pew have shown that our community is increasing, not only in voting age but in numbers overall. So, the number of folks in the Latinx community that are turning 18 is, I think, around 800,000 every single day, and so we know that the candidate that is elected in 2020 in the Democratic primaries will not win the general election without the Latinx vote. 
- So, there is a lotta talk about who won, who lost. And, Rick, I think, obviously, these polls aren't just being watched closely by these campaigns, they're also being watched by the Trump campaign. What do they take away from what we've seen so far? 
- Well, I think the imprimatur of invincibility on Joe Biden has been removed. And I think Kamala Harris is right, Kamala, I'm gonna learn how to pronounce that name, Harris is right where she wants to be, because you do not wanna be the frontrunner this early out. Being in second place is a terrific place to be. 
- [Chris] Would Trump rather run against her than Biden or vice versa, or any of the other candidates, for that matter? 
- I don't know, I think it's too early to say. I don't think anything's set in stone. I think the leaders are gonna shift a little bit and there's gonna be a lotta people that drop off. But what's significant is Joe Biden just lost ground in every single demographic, among all the ideological spectrum, and Kamala Harris gained in every single one, particularly black voters, which probably came out of Joe Biden. But Elizabeth Warren was kinda flat, actually. She has lost significant support among black voters. But Joe Biden still remains the top of the heap and the person that people believe will beat Donald Trump. But Kamala Harris has improved significantly her believability that she can beat Donald Trump, and that's a huge factor with Democratic voters this time around. 
- Yeah, I mean, obviously, Doug, you gotta build a winning coalition. There's a new piece by NBC News reporter Alex Seitz-Wald, who writes, Harris stunned Biden. But can she meld a winning Obama coalition? How do you build that? And who, from your perspective at this point, is doing the right things to move in that direction? 
- Well, you start building it by putting organizers on the ground, and I think Kamala Harris's campaign is doing that more and more, both in Iowa and South Carolina. Elizabeth Warren has a huge field staff that she's invested in in a number of key early states. And so, having that direct person-to-person communication is really important in terms of building out your coalition. Moments like the debate are really important. When these candidates start to advertise and get their message out across mass communication mediums, that's gonna be really important. But, look, I would take issue with one thing that Rick said. Look, I think that with Kamala Harris, there is a lotta room to grow. And a lotta people didn't know her or Elizabeth Warren, so they took advantage of that and both of them did really well. Elizabeth Warren did very well, I think, as well. 
- Seize the day, right? Liz, Rick, Doug, thanks to all of you. Happy Fourth. 
- Thanks, Chris, Happy Fourth.
