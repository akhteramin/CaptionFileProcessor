[Music] In seven days [Music] 
- Welcome back in to Wake Up Washington. The record-breaking film, Black Panther, is the first superhero movie ever to be nominated for best picture. It features a predominately Black cast, and gives Black boys and girls a chance to imagine themselves as superheroes. Well, Black Panther is also an example of Afrofuturism. The cultural movement has long been part of African-American arts. Alex Wagner explains its history and revival as we celebrate Black History Month. 
- I see these tweets at times where people are like, I just wanna see Black mermaids and Black people in space. I wanna see Black stories that aren't about Black pain because the pain is constant. 
- [Alex] At just 25 years old, Nigerian-American writer, Tomi Adeyemi, is among the artists at the forefront of the resurgence of Afrofuturism. 
- It's just kind of like a utopia to imagine what if. Like, what if this story wasn't a story of having everything taken away and having so much, like, oppression, and brutality and senseless murder, and slavery, like, what if it could be something completely different? 
- That's the foundation of the best seller Children of Blood and Bone, a West-African fantasy novel featuring a young Black female protagonist. When did it occur to you that women of color men of color, children of color could be fantasy characters? 
- I didn't realize until my senior year of high school that no characters look like me, so all of my protagonists were White or they were biracial. Then I realized it's not just me who needs this, it's like, it's other people who look like me, but it's also people who don't look like me because the reason I didn't think I could be in a story was 'cause I didn't see it. 
- [Alex] Through her writing, she also directly tackles racism and inequality. 
- [Tomi] I wanted to write a story that commented on the Black experience. 
- In some ways, Afrofuturism is inherently kind of a revolutionary act. 
- Yeah. 
- Do you think of yourself as a revolutionary? 
- At this point I can think of myself as a part of the revolution. 
- [Alex] And so does Grammy Nominee, Janelle Monae. [Music] Oh me, oh me, oh me, oh my [Music] On her new album, Dirty Computer, Monae explores Afrofuturism through music. 
- Afrofuturism is about Black people, us seeing ourselves in the future. Knowing that we are not the stereotypes that have been perpetuated on us. [Music] I am not America's nightmare [Music] 
- [Alex] Monae believes this is the time for Afrocentric art. 
- It's a way for Black women like myself to tell our stories through our own lens because I think it's important that we're telling our stories, because if we allow other people who are not us to tell our stories, they may not be told properly. 
- [Black Panther] The revolution. 
- [Alex] Enter Black Panther. With a Black superhero and a nearly all Black cast set in an African-inspired utopia sometime in the future-
- 
- We are home. 
- [Alex] Panther popularized the idea of Afrofuturism, but its roots run deep. 
- All the early abolitionists that we celebrate, the Frederick Douglass's, the Sojourner Truth's, were all Afrofuturists, Harriet Tubman, Sun Ra, George Clinton. 
- [Alex] Cultural critic, Greg Tate, is considered one the leading scholars of this movement. 
- Anybody who had a vision of the Black people's story and presence and imaging, can be told and elevated. 
- On one hand we have a movie like Black Panther, which is a lot of people's entry point for Afrofuturism, but you also have Black Lives Matter movement, right? 
- Right. 
- [Alex] Do you see a connection between those two things? 
- Oh, definitely, I mean, I don't think that Black Panther would have happened without the precedent of Black Lives Matter 'cause I think that anytime there's outrage and protest in the streets, the cultural elites in America tend to open up resources and opportunity and space for, you know, for Black creatives. 
- [Alex] And the response suggests audiences will start to see even more Afrofuturist art. 
- Black Panther! Yes! 
- [Alex] Black Panther snagged the top prize at the SAG Awards, is nominated for seven Oscars-
- 
- You get to decide. 
- And a sequel is underway. Tomi Adeyemi's book is being made into a major motion picture, with two more books in the works. Do you think arts and entertainment are changing? 
- I definitely think they're changing. We're finally getting people who want to share it with people, and people who don't think that, oh, people aren't gonna relate to this because it's Black, or they're not gonna relate to this because it's African, it's too different. They're like, no this is a great story with great characters, so let's make it visible, and when people find it, they'll fall in love with it. 
- Gotta say, I'm pretty happy to see the direction that arts and entertainment is headed into now. It just seems more inclusive, and yes, films like that, you have little boys and little girls, you know, who say, hey, you know, I see myself there. 
- And I can be anything I want, I can be a superhero. I can conquer whatever I want. I'm excited to see how Black Panther does at the Oscars. 
- Oh yeah, tonight, oh yeah, I know it's gonna sweep up a lot of the awards there. 
- It's gonna be the talk of the town tomorrow morning. 
- Yeah, for sure. 
- Yeah. 
- All right, talk of the town around here is your forecast, it's gonna be nice. 
- A little bumpy ride, we got the showers moving out. It's turning warmer today, but it is windy. So those gusty winds could bring down trees and power lines between today, tonight and tomorrow morning. That's when we'll see winds gusting in the metro as high as 50 miles per hour, higher than that out in the mountains. We'll see a pretty quiet week overall, more showers at the end of the week, but today it's all about the wind and the warmth. 
- That's right, so take it easy out there. Enjoy your Sunday. That does it for Wake Up Washington. CBS Sunday Morning is coming up next. 
- Have a great day!
