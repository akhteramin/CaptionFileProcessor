- [Reporter] July 4th, this is not out of the realm that has happened before. 
- Yeah, it is not that unusual. We've just seen such an acceleration, right, and the way free agency works overall. We've never seen this much money committed in the first 24 hours. 
- No, it's over almost four billion. 
- Right, and there you go. So we're on day four, calm down, be zen, do what you need to do. We will get you through the Kawhilight Zone because we're back later tonight, at 7:00 eastern. Come right back, we'll be here waiting for you. 
- Straight ahead on Daily Wager, the dog days of summer are here. How a holiday heat wave could affect baseball totals across the next few days and could that sunshine also affect hotdogs? The voice of the Nathan's Hotdog Eating Contest, joins us to tell you how to bet the contest, tomorrow. Plus, we head to Indianapolis for more football prop bets. Can Andrew Luck and T.Y. Hilton take Indy back to the playoffs? Happy hump day, welcome into Daily Wager. I am Doug Kezirian, and we'd also like to welcome those watching on ESPN2, today. In case you have never seen the show, over the next hour, we hope to make you a more informed sports bettor. We have a packed show coming up and who knows, Kawhi could maybe make a decision at any second and that would obviously, turn the NBA future odds upside down. Until then, let's get rolling with the rest of the show, which includes the Subway Series. First pitch, about an hour away. Mets beat the Yanks last night, just New York Yankees second loss in their last 15 games. Also, the home run record's been snapped. Tonight, Domingo German makes his first start since June 7th. He had an ERA over 8 1/2 in his last three starts, before a hip injury. Jason Vargas, Vargas, he's 2.36 ERA in his last seven starts. Despite those trends, the Bombers are favored for the game in the first five and the run total is 10, 10! Joe Fortenbaugh joins me from the Bay Area, here. Joe, what's your play in this one? 
- Doug, it may sound crazy but I like the Mets at plus 130, in this matchup. The Yanks scored just two runs in that game, last night, against the Mets. That was just the third time in their last 39 games that they scored two or fewer runs. Now, a lot of that is due credit to Zack Wheeler, in the Met bullpen, which showed up last night but I gotta wonder, after that series across the pond against the Red Sox, maybe there's a little jet lag and fatigue at play here, for the Yankees, so I'm gonna keep that in mind. As you mentioned, it's the lefty, Jason Vargas, pitching for the Mets tonight. Two or fewer earned runs in 10 of 13 starts this year. The Mets are six and two in his last eight home starts and not only that, the Yanks are just 24th in OPS against left-handed pitching and will be without Edwin Encarnacion tonight. So you add it all up, I like the Mets here at plus 130. 
- All right, sounds good and just to give you a little push back, Joe, I've heard the whole jet lag thing but the Boston Red Sox did put up 10 runs last night or maybe the Blue Jays were just that bad yesterday, we shall see. So, you're on the Mets. I know I talked you into the first five yesterday, my apologies. Yanks, Mets, though just one of five games tonight with a total of at least 10 runs. Astros, Rockies, leading the way with a total of 14 1/2. They combine for 17 last night, at Coors Field. Let's go out to Las Vegas. Preston Johnson joins me from Planet Hollywood, overlooking Caesers. Preston, what do your numbers have an edge on, in terms of all those high over/unders? 
- It's the Astros, Rockies under 14 1/2. My projection is 13.1 runs and that accounts for nine mile per hour winds to dead center. It accounts for the fact, they're obviously playing at Coors Field, and we even talked about yesterday, it's crazy having these Astros bats, which are so much better than the Rockies, hitting in Coors Field, and I still, looking at this number, think this is way too drastic, and you look at the pitching match of Wade Miley. I mean this guy's been just stellar for two years and if you say, oh, someone from the American League pitching in Coors for the first time, he was with the Diamondbacks, he's accustomed to pitching in Coors. He even pitched there last year, when he was at the Brewers. So he has some reps there at Coors Field. I don't think that's gonna mess him up. He's 75th percentile, league wide and hard hit percentage. Waited on base against, expected batting average against, all of these metrics and on the other side, Lambert, I mean he's a rookie. He hasn't been pitching too well but he's the number one prospect for the Rockies. That is the concern some, is that the Astros just go nuts. But 14, that's way to drastic. I have it right at 13 almost, I gotta go under. 
- All right, and on those lists of double digit totals, if I had to pick one, I'd go over 11 1/2 with the Phillies and Braves. Both pitchers have really struggled. Bryse Wilson, ERA over eight, Nick Pivetta, at ERA over seven in his last three starts. I know it's an umpire that would favor pitchers instead of batters here, but I'm not gonna overthink it. I'll take the over, in that one. Preston, sit tight for that. And Joe, what about you on that list of over/unders, the double digits, which one jumps out to you? 
- The second half of the White Sox, Tigers, doubleheader. I'm going under 10 1/2 runs, due largely to the unknown variety of pitchers that we're seeing tonight. For the Tigers, it's going to be Tyler Alexander, the rookie southpaw. Opponents hit just 234 against him in the month of June. There's virtually no tape on the kid, no experience that the White Sox will have against him. So perhaps, the second half of the doubleheader, they're tired, they've been out on the diamond all day. This kid will be able to take advantage of them a little bit and not only that, Chicago's about middle of the pack in OPS, against left-handed pitching. Now, on the other side of the equation, it's gonna be Ross Detwiler, who just earned his first Major League Baseball victory in nearly three years. His first time out, just a week ago, went up against Minnesota, looked really sharp, gave up just two earned runs in five innings pitched. He'll go up against the Tiger lineup tonight. That's 25th in OPS, against left-handed pitching. So, I think the pitchers have a little bit of success. We play the under, in 10 1/2 runs, White Sox, Tigers. 
- All right, sounds good. Sit tight, Joe, much more from both you and Preston throughout the show. And we've talked college football in recent shows, Big Ten yesterday, also covered the SEC. Let's do a little ACC. Here's a look at your highest, six highest win totals, courtesy of Caesars, for the coming season. No surprise, Clemson with a sizeable gap over the rest of the conference, 11 1/2 minus 110, either side. Obviously, Trevor Lawrence returns for the defending national champions. Miami at 8 1/2, Virginia Tech at eight, and a trio of NC State, Syracuse, and Virginia, all at 7 1/2, with varying juices on that. Let's welcome in The Bear, Chris Fallica and Stanford Steve. I knew you guys were close if I mentioned college football. 
- Absolutely, let's get it going. 
- You ready to fire away? I'm gonna start with the defending champs, Clemson, 11 1/2. 
- Under. 
- Over, look this is FPI, our Football Power Index projects them to win all their games by at least 20, except for two, home to A&M, and that's 15 and then at South Carolina, 18. So, all of them by at least two touchdowns. Their only questionable games are at home or just not, it should be wire to wire. I think Alabama being in the race. They're gonna hear a lot about that. We'll keep them on point and we tend to think, oh, Clemson always will drop one. Well, they didn't last year so we can't assume that, and I think over 11 1/2. 
- Last four years of regular season, they've lost twice. Both of them have been, is 19, 20 point favorites. 
- And this is offense. 
- The whole Clemsoning thing, oh, I gotta, that's long gone. Their offense is great. The only thing that I, I would play the over on that, as well. The only thing I think that could trip them up is an injury, which nobody wants to see, but they're just so much better than everybody on the schedule. 
- The schedule's been they get A&M at home, that's key, obviously. 
- Yep. 
- The schedule's really favorable for them to run the table. 
- I think what makes it favorable, we're gonna get to it with our teams, also though, but I think the conference is terrible. 
- Brutal. 
- It is awful. 
- Fire away. 
- All right, I'll start, but on the other side, I look at Florida State, okay. Now, they were a disaster last year, okay. 
- Yes. 
- They won five games. They started nine different combinations on the offensive line, okay. Quarterbacks were coming in and out of there. Defensively, they were awful. They didn't rank in the top 100 in any defensive categories. 
- They were on the field, short fields every, off from the ball point. 
- On offense, I think they averaged 260 yards a game, 21 points. Those weren't good in any top 100 categories, but I look at the experience, I look at the value of the recruits that they still had. Those guys were all playing out of position because of injuries and what have you, and guys just having to have to play to fill the rosters. 
- There was disarray through the coaching team. 
- They're so, yeah, absolutely. 
- There's a lot of reasons. 
- But with the combination of the roster, okay, and then the schedule, okay, I think it's doable. The number is seven, they have the talent to do it. When you look at the schedule, five of the teams won nine games last year but that's a big drop off. Those teams lost a lot of games and I think it's pretty favorable when you look at everything. I take three games that aren't winnable, at Clemson, at Florida, at Virginia. 
- We talked last week, about those week one lies, when they came out and Boise State, Florida State, was one of the games that Doug and I talked about. I think what you're mentioning, I like Florida State in that game. You can not go to Virginia with the chance to potentially be wanting to, right off the bat, offer the year that you had last year, but you're right. You think Kendal Briles, maybe biggest coordinator hire, going into the 2008, maybe him, or maybe Alex Grinch at Oklahoma. 
- Yeah, I mean, what he has to play with, Blackman-
- 
- Terry. 
- Experienced two years ago. Terry's a A1 receiver. 
- Willie Taggart can recruit. He's demonstrated that-
- 
- Absolutely. 
- In the state of Florida and he finally gets another year under his belt to implement all those guys. 
- And I will ask the question, who do you think is gonna come in? Not who's gonna play Clemson in an ACC title game. Who's the second best team, when you look at it? Three months ago, you asked the question when we did a Kentucky Derby podcast and I'm like, I don't know, Syracuse, they looked great last year. 
- FPI says 8.1 win, so they side with you. Bear, what-
- 
- Early lean. 
- Early lean, okay. What about you, Bear? 
- Last year, Steve and I were, Bullet Shawn B, see we love Addazio's dudes. 
- Love them. 
- We went over the six and they cashed. Problem this year at BC, Addazio's dudes are gone. The offensive line is gone. Ray, Strahan, all those guys in defense, gone. I'm on the under this year with BC. I just look, I think as AJ Dillon went, and then the injury to quarterback, the Eagles offense went. I just don't know if you can line up an offensive line and just run Dillon 35 times like they want to. They got a coordinator change on both sides of the ball so we'll see how that goes. But Addazio, they've been a six or a seven win every year, under him. You'll have the Virginia Tech game to start the year, will be tough. They should win the next three. I'm high on Wake Forest, I think the Deacs are gonna be really good but look at the way they finish. I mean, those final five games, if they haven't gotten to seven by the time they go to Clemson, I don't think they're gonna get it. 
- Goodnight, yeah, exactly. I mean, look at the difference. That's a Florida State team and a Boston College team. Look at the difference in the schedules. That's why I like Florida State, it's over, and you're like, BC's under. 
- And why a team like Florida State, you can be so high on and then exceeding the number. They recruit so well, they reload. It's not like BC has been recruiting these great, great. 
- No, limited. 
- They develop players, they find guys who they can get into their system and they're a young offensive line and a lot of turnover. I'm thinking get into a bowl this year with six wins would be a good job. 
- Of all the ACC teams-
- 
- Really good. 
- Between Vegas and what they project, biggest delta, biggest difference is BC to the under, 5.1. 
- And I think it's like a-
- 
- You got a calculator over there? 
- A spreadsheet here. My computer-
- 
- It's a map, Steve. He probably did take it at Stanford. 
- I still will say, Virginia and I have a thing, they look good. 
- Yeah, all right, well fortunately, 
- We've broke up like that. 
- We have plenty of time. We got game one lines, or week one lines we can dissect, as well, throughout the rest of the summer. Bear and Stanford Steve here, in the house. We all like a little tennis action, especially in the morning, right, not a lot on, fire away on. 
- Give me that money! 
- Brad Gilbert as we think about Wimbledon underdogs, galore. We'll have Patrick McEnroe next, with some picks. Also, props for Colts players, courtesy of Caesars. Where do you stand on Andrew Luck passing touchdowns this year, 32 1/2. We'll break it down as Daily Wager rolls on.

- [Doug] Back with you on Daily Wager. Today at Wimbledon, recapping just some of the action. But hey, the biggest story probably is Coco Gauff, the 15 year old American, what a story. She won today as a plus 155 underdog, a pick that Brad Gilbert gave out yesterday on this show. So, she moves on to the third round, she'll face Polona Hercog. So we gave that one out yesterday, as a winner. What about what else is going on? Lots of upsets so far but the big names do remain and are in action tomorrow in the second round. Roger Federer, minus 20,000 favorite against Britain's Jay Clarke. Fed was minus 15,000 in the first round. Rafael Nadal, looking for a second straight Grand Slam win, not nearly as big of a favorite, minus 360 against Australia, Nick Kyrgios. Those players have split six career meetings. Kyrgios did win the last, and on the women's side, 11th seed, Serena Williams is going to face a qualifier. She's a perfect 18 and O in second round matches in the All England Club and is a minus 750 favorite. So let's take a look at some of the other notable matchups as we, that catch our eye, Angelique Kerber, minus 950. Hey, you don't like the big juice, you don't wanna lay the lumber, you could always do a money line parlay, and Sam Querrey with the upset, is now minus 460 in his second match. As for the couple of potential upsets in other picks, let's turn it over to our Patrick McEnroe. 
- Expecting more beautiful weather on day four at Wimbledon and the match we've all been waiting for on the men's side in round two will be between the two-time champ, Rafael Nadal and the wacky one from Australia, Nick Kyrgios, who can also play some serious tennis, particularly on grass. Remember a couple of years ago, Kyrgios upset Nadal, right here at Wimbledon on center court. I'm not expecting that to happen tomorrow. I think Nadal's ready for this, having won his 12th French Open, he's got some confidence. Of course, this is his least favorite surface. The favorite surface for Kyrgios, but he does not look like the player he was a couple of years ago. I expected Nadal to maybe drop a set, but probably win this one in four sets. On the ladies side, Sloane Stephens, she's a number nine seed here. She'll try to celebrate the Fourth of July with a second round win, taking on Wang Yafan from China, who's a solid player, ranked in the high 50s in the world. But I think Stephens, despite playing on a surface which hasn't been her best over the years, she looked good in round number one. I expect her to win comfortably in straight sets. Back to you, Doug. 
- All right, Patrick, thanks so much and look, it's Independence Day and fire away in the morning, throughout the afternoon, and you got some baseball on July 4th, but that is the best part about Wimbledon. The women's soccer we've talked about, action throughout the day. You can fire away on more than 10 1/2 hours of second round play, ESPN, ESPN+, and always streaming live on the ESPN app. And we've been talking a lot of pro football props, doing tours of each division. We're doing the South Divisions this week. AFC South, here with the Colts player props, courtesy of Caesars. Andrew Luck's passing touchdown total, 32 1/2. He's gone over just twice in his five full seasons. Marlon Mack needs a 1,000 yard rushing season to go over his total. The Colts have had one, 1,000 yard rush in the last decade, that was Frank Gore in 2016. Let's bring in now, our male modelers, Preston Johnson and Mike Clay, who have spreadsheets and laptops in hand, as we break this down. Andrew Luck, 32 TD passes. We'll start with you, Mike. What do your numbers say here? 
- Definitely going over on this one. This guy is 39 passing touchdowns last season. That was second most in the NFL, behind only, some guy named Patrick Mahomes, you may have heard of him. The last time we saw Andrew Luck for a full 16 game season, he had 40 passing touchdowns and really, the key here is opportunity. You have a stat, OTD, which looks at essentially, expected passing touchdowns based on your opportunity, where you are on the field, your volume of throws. Luck, last year, topped in the NFL at 34.0. The key, throws them to the end zone. The Colts had 50 last season. That was most in the league. This offense sets up for him to throw a ton of touchdowns. 
- All right, sounds good. Preston, what do your projections have? 
- You guys know, we do this every day and I'm generally, pretty married to my projections and I had Andrew Luck come in at 28 touchdowns and I couldn't believe it, and there's no way I'm betting under on this, though. You look at it and I agree with Mike. There's so much value here with Andrew Luck, assuming he plays a full season. I'm not sure how he doesn't go over 32 1/2. So I actually, am staying off of this, despite my projections pointing to an edge, on the under, but because I am lower on Andrew Luck's projections, there are some correlated bets which we'll get to here in a bit, which I think are safer and better, as far as some of these receivers go. 
- I like that gut check and especially with the offensive line improving over the last couple of seasons. His health is more likely, obviously, to stay intact. T.Y. Hilton, receiving yards, 1,210 1/2. Mike, we'll start with you, what do you got? 
- Well, I'm going over on this one, for sure. I mean, you look back at the last three seasons that T.Y. Hilton and Andrew Luck have played together in full. Hilton has blown this nuffer away all three seasons and there's a few things in play here. One of them is durability. He's missed four games in seven seasons, in the league. He's finished top 17 in receiving yards each of the past six seasons and guys, he's been in the 80th percentile or better in yards per reception, each of the past five seasons. It's Andrew Luck's go-to guy. This is a high volume, pass heavy offense. Hilton, I think, gets to this number easily. 
- All right, Preston, and you? 
- This is one where we disagree. So I'm correlated here with not really loving Andrew Luck's numbers but Hilton, I have at 1,140 yards. So for me, there is a slight edge to the under. Then you actually just look at the scope of who Luck will be throwing to. They went out of their way to bring in Devin Funchess. They drafted Parris Campbell in the second round, out of Ohio State, who I think's gonna be stellar. Then you have Eric Ebron, who played a bunch last year in tight end. Well, they have a second tight end named Jack Doyle, who missed a lot of last season. He'll be an option, as well. I have those two tight ends combined, projected for over 140 targets. So for me, I think T.Y. Hilton's total target share is going down. I have him under 1,200 yards. So I like it at 1,210 1/2, it's a bet under for me. 
- All right, so you guys disagree there. I like that, I like that you would disagree. Mike, let's go to you, Marlon Mack, will he be a 1,000 yard rusher again? Not combined, just rushing yards. 
- Yes, he will and he sort of was last year, if you look at his 14 games including the playoffs. He had a little over 1,100 yards and again, that was with playing a situational roll, for a lot of the early part of the season. The guy has been terrific since he's entered the league, and 4.8 yards per carry, last season. You don't wanna get too wrapped up in yards per carry but he's been above averaging yards after contact per attempt in both of his NFL seasons. He's got a lot of help before contact, last season, from Quenton Nelson, as well. And here's the big one, we know volume is king for running backs. In his last five games, last season, he handled at least 75% of the Colts designed runs in each of those games. The guy is working his way into becoming a two-down workhorse for this Colt's offense. I like the over, a lot here. 
- All right, so Mike, you're certainly bullish on the Colts offense. Preston, you mentioned Eric Ebron just a moment ago, 6 1/2 touchdowns for his prop. Where are you headed with this? 
- This is another gut check but I'm going with it. I have projected 5.2 touchdowns. I mentioned that Jack Doyle is back. He should be healthier and I project him to have a good portion as a second tight end, of his potential target share. I think Devin Funchess, I mean, this guy is 6'4, 240, as far as red zone opportunities go and goal line opportunities, Funchess, Doyle, and Ebron. Ebron, outside of last year, where he scored 13 touchdowns, this is why it's a gut check, under 6 1/2, he never got more than five touchdowns in a season. That was in Detroit, and Matthew Stafford's not inept. So for me, I just think there's so much going around here now, for Luck, he has so many weapons. I gotta go under Ebron. I don't think we'll see what we did last year. 
- And again, a little technicality, it's total touchdowns. So it includes a, maybe an inside handoff, a recovered fumble in the goal line, something like that, so it's total touchdown. 
- There you go. That changes everything. 
- Yeah, I know. Yeah, you wanna go back to your spreadsheet and reevaluate it. Mike, thank you very much. More to come from Preston, straight ahead. And from player props to team props, Indy's win total is 10, which is what they won last year. The over, plus 110 and the yes, no, to make the playoffs. Yes, is minus $1.75, which they sure in fact did in Frank Reich's first season with the Colts. Let's go out to New York and bring in our Anita Marks. Anita, over/under 10, now, I am passing 'cause I think it's gonna be right there. They have to face the NFC South, really tough schedule, supposed to be competitive division, so I think it's gonna be right around there. So I'm gonna pass, what about you? 
- I'm on the over, a little bit. I'm not banking the mortgage on the over but I am putting a little money on the over for a number of reasons. Let's talk about the schedule. Let's take a look at the schedule, actually. I have them winning their division, the AFC South. I think they split with Houston. I think they go two and O against Tennessee. They could possibly go two and O against the Jaguars. So I'm looking at five and one, four and three in their division, easy games, with all due respect to Oakland, Denver, and Miami. Here's where it gets tough. Look at their road games, and the quarterbacks they're gonna be facing, you ready? The Chargers, the Chiefs, the Steelers, the Texans, the Saints, it's a tough road game. I have them going three and two on the road. So it's gonna be close but I think this team is just so good, Doug, that I have them at 10, 11 win. So I'm putting a little money on the over. 
- All right, sounds good, that's fair. I was definitely leaning that way but I'm gonna pass. Now, as for the yes, no, I like the yes, to make the playoffs at minus $1.75. A little different here than the division because you could get to the playoffs and not get over 10 wins, nine or 10 wins in this division could win it. So I'm gonna say, I like the yes, to make the playoffs at minus $1.75. Obviously, you have the bonus of the wild card but that's why I'm differentiating between that and over 10 wins, what about you? 
- Again, I have them winning this division. I love this team, out of all the 22 starters of course, on offense and defense, they only have one guy not coming back, that's amazing. That just doesn't happen in this day and age in free agency. On top of that, they are one of the most balanced teams in the NFL, first and third down conversions in 2018. Andrew Luck, when he's healthy, he's a top five quarterback. He's got the best offensive line coming in, wide receivers, you've gotta love T.Y. Hilton. They add Devin Funchess, he's gonna be a stud in the red zone. They draft Parris Campbell, he's a speedy wide receiver. I love their one-two punch with their tight ends. Eric Ebron took a big step with them this year as opposed to what we saw in Detroit. Jack Doyle, he's gonna be healthy and then they add Justin Houston on the defensive side of the ball, so, I just, I love this team. I think they're gonna make the playoffs. I think they win the division, Doug. 
- Sounds like we're all very positive on the Colts. That's Anita Marks and she'll join us later in the show to discuss the weekends PGA tournament. That's coming up later. 
- There you go. 
- [Doug] And we're approaching the bottom of the hour and in these parts, that means one thing, Best Bets, just around the corner, stay tuned.

- I'm Tom from Kane 11 and I have one question for you. What size socks do you wear? If you're like everyone else we've asked, just simply don't know, how could you.

- This is our moment, let's get it. Three, two, one, here we go Peloton. [Music] Ain't my fault [Music] [Music] That I'm out here getting loose [Music] [Music] Gotta blame it on [Music]

- All right, back with you, recapping, Best Bets. Strong night for us on the diamond. Astros got four runs in the seventh, turned a three run deficit into a one run victory. Plus 117 for Preston, there on the Stros, A's hit for Joe. My Rays, Dodgers parlay got there, thanks to five consecutive walks. Hey, better lucky than good. All right, so five and two for the week, we are, and let's keep the momentum going. Here at the desk, Stanford Steve here, standing by for your best bet. We'll get that in a moment but let's go back out to Las Vegas. Preston, what do you have for your best bet? You're on the T-box first. 
- I'm going to the Summer League. In the NBA, the Grizzlies minus 2 1/2 against the Cavaliers, who we fitted on Monday against the Spurs. We talked about their inexperience, the only guy getting run that has any pro experience is Nas Mutulong, who played a total of 85 minutes for the Jazz the last two years. On the other side, this Memphis team, there's a roster filled with a bunch of guys who played fairly regular minutes the last two seasons when Memphis was tanking. Ivan Rabb, Washburn, Watanabe, Jevon Carter, these guys took total, 63 points, I think, on Monday when they played. They all rested yesterday. Now, Carter, worth noting, actually just got traded to the Suns, probably won't play because they can't afford him to get injured but these other three guys combined, with 34 points, they have so much experience compared to the Cavs, who are playing a bunch of rookies. It doesn't impact the projection too much. It should be more like minus five. We're getting two, 2 1/2 out there on the market. So I'm going with the Grizzlies. 
- [Steve] You believe in rest days in Vegas, come on, or was that in Salt Lake? 
- This one's in Salt Lake. 
- [Steve] All right, a little different, right. 
- The altitude. 
- [Doug] Yeah, a little different extracurricular activity, fewer distractions, I would say. 
- [Steve] You would think, you would think, never know. 
- You never know. All right, so Preston's playing to his home court advantage out there in Las Vegas. Joe, what do you got for your best bet? 
- The San Francisco Giants at plus 120 over the San Diego Padres, as they look for the sweep tonight. The Giant bats have come alive, as of late. Three straight wins, all of which featured 10 or more runs. Now tonight, the Padres, who ranked 19th in OPS are gonna face Giant right-hander, Shaun Anderson. Anderson has been the most consistent pitcher for the Giants this season. A lot of people may think that's Madison Bumgarner but Bumgarner's been up and down through the months. Anderson's made nine starts, giving up two or fewer runs in six of those starts. Go back to June 12th, he faces Padre lineup, four hits, two were in runs in six innings pitched. He's gonna take the mound for the Giants, which is the big edge here. I think he's extremely undervalued at this point in the season. For the Padres, it's gonna be the youngster, Cal Quantrill, the righty pitching against San Francisco. He's coming out of the bullpen to make his first start in a few weeks, six starts this season. He's got an ERA north of five, 18 earned runs in just 31 innings pitched. So, I like the Giants to get the sweep tonight and then they're off tomorrow, first time off on July 4th since 1941. Giants plus 120, you can book it. 
- All right, and the Giants bats have been hot a little bit, in San Diego. So, we got Preston in Vegas, picking a Summer League game. 
- Yeah, Grizzlies, Giants, parlay. 
- So Joe, in the Bay Area, taking the Giants. Are you going the tri-state area for yours? 
- Absolutely. 
- All right, staying true to form here. 
- The Mets aren't gonna win the season series from the almighty Yankees. 
- Yes. 
- First time since 2013, that's not gonna happen. 
- No sir. 
- Lemans back on the mound for the Yankees, take the Yankees. 
- Vargas throwing well, lately, no. 
- Really. 
- All right, so you're sticking to the home team, so to speak, Preston. I'm going with my team and where I'm gonna be this holiday weekend, I'm going with the Dodgers. Look, I got lucky last night, first one to admit it. 
- Lucky! 
- Beyond lucky. 
- I don't wanna hear about you with bad beats anymore, ever again. 
- Walker Buehler, think about this, an eight start stretch, an ERA of 1.64, eight starts, then got touched up the last one. That was at Coors Field, let's throw that out. Throw out Coors Field. 
- Throw it out. 
- And the Dodgers are hot, amazing health record. 
- Yeah, thanks to five straight walks with two outs. 
- Well, we're gonna need to cover a run and a half. 
- Which has never been done before. 
- We're gonna hope to not to get to the bottom of the ninth. We need a little breathing room. 
- You need a homer then. 
- But I don't think that Buehler's gonna give up much. I think this one gets away from the D-backs and who knows. Locker room demoralized after that? 
- All right. 
- I'm hoping certainly shaky. I'll lay the 1 1/2 minus 120. I couldn't find any obscene money lines to parlay with the Dodgers, straight up, so. All right, we'll just lay the run and a half and try to stay hot this week. Steve's laying the $1.38, as well. All of us are playing to our home teams, I love it. Joe's plus money with the Giants, and the Grizzlies for Preston, out there laying tuna. A lot of scouting for Preston, I love it. 
- [Steve] I know, see him Monday. 
- Gold Cup Semi-finals tonight, men's soccer for the Americans as they face Jamaica. Remember they met last Gold Cup Final in 2017, two, one victory for the Americans. Three way betting, U.S. is 190, minus $1.90 to win in regulation, in the draw, plus 275 and Jamaica obviously, a huge underdog with the over/under at 2 1/2 and the under is minus $1.90. For more, let's go out to Nashville, ahead of tonight's game and bring in ESPN FC reporter, Jeff Carlisle. Jeff, appreciate the taking the time. U.S. favorite, as you very well know, but let's go back about a month ago where they lost a friendly to Jamaica, one-nil. How does the team tonight compare to the one that lost that game? 
- Well, it's gonna be a very different team that takes the field for the Unites States tonight. I count at least seven different players, will be in the starting lineup, possibly eight, and those are key players, as well, key attacking players when you're talking about Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie. The Ford is either gonna be Gyasi Zardes or Jozy Altidore. None of those players play in that game. Then you've got the guy providing the shield in front of the defense, Michael Bradley. He's gonna be a key player for the U.S. tonight. He's gonna have to play very well, be very mobile, and so obviously, it's gonna be a very different team for the U.S. that takes the field. Contrast that with Jamaica, I counted seven players that took the field in the quarter final against Panama, that were also on the field that night in Washington, D.C. when they played that friendly against the U.S. So, Jamaica's gonna have a few new faces, the U.S. is gonna have a lot of new faces. 
- All right, and the over/under's 2 1/2? How much scoring do you expect? 
- I don't expect a whole lot of scoring tonight. Jamaica has only conceded two goals in the entire tournament. The United States has kept a clean sheet in every one of their Gold Cup games. Their defense has been very stout, that the back line has been very consistent. They've been tested, I mean, Curacao, in the quarter finals was definitely a team that tested the U.S. with possession. They had some good chances, as well, and Zack Steffen in goal has been very, very good. So, on the other hand, you've got Andre Blake, who's a goal keeper that MLS fans are very familiar with. He plays for the Philadelphia Union. He's also been very good and came up big a couple of times in the quarter final win over Panama. So, I don't expect a whole lot of scoring tonight. I expect it to be a very tight semifinal like we saw last night with Mexico and Haiti. So again, 2 1/2 goals seems like a lot to me, so I expect it to be a one-nil affair, for sure. 
- In favor of who? 
- The United States, I would agree that the United States are slight favorites, but again, Jamaica's played them very tough and Jamaica's gone deep in this tournament, the last two additions. They've made the final two times, so when it comes to the Gold Cup, Jamaica's a very difficult team to break down, so. But I look at the, I see the U.S. getting through tonight. 
- All right, sounds good. That's ESPN FC reporter, Jeff Carlisle, joining us from Nashville, ahead of tonight's Gold Cup semifinal, thank you, Jeff. 
- You're welcome. 
- [Doug] And we're continuing to cover a wide range of sports.

- Time now, for Daily Diamond Dogs and the best part is the dog we get to feature. This is Baxter, who is a service dog here at ESPN, works with our audio engineer, Tyler. Baxter, as you can see, certainly in charge and he's now responsible for hitting the bleep button whenever I lose a bet on set. So Baxter is profiled as we take a look at the biggest underdogs of the night and the biggest one is actually a home team. The Blue Jays, in Toronto, facing Chris Sale and the Red Sox. D-backs above 200 on the comeback face, and the Dodgers and Walker Buehler, as I noted earlier, and the Marlins did close around plus 240 against the Mets, but first pitch already underway at 6:05. Joe Fortenbaugh, back with me. What's your Diamond Dog tonight, Joe? 
- All right, Doug, limited options tonight and there is no way I wanna get in front of the Walker Buehler train. So we're gonna fade Chris Sale and the Red Sox. Give me Toronto plus 240. Chris Sale broke from the gate in sluggish fashion this season. A lot of people wondering what went wrong, settled down and was outstanding. Now, as of late, a bit iffy, not terrible, but a bit iffy. Last restarts, he's given up 10 earned runs over 17 innings pitched. Again, not terrible, but maybe there's something there we can take advantage of, in this situation. One of those starts was at Fenway against Toronto, gave up a few runs, didn't exactly work that deep into the game. So this may be a spot where you can take advantage of Chris Sale, who by the way, this is the worst hard hit percentage of his entire career and his fastball's down about a full mile an hour, over his results from last season, so not the guy we saw last season, still a very good pitcher. Boston has lost five of eight, so this could be a nice little opportunity here to back the dog at plus 240. 
- Yeah, I can't fault you there, given the price there on the dog. I'm gonna go with The Royals plus 145, a little bit of a force, we usually, has to go higher. In two starts since returning from injury, Mike Clevinger has allowed 12 runs. It sure looks like he returned too quickly from that back injury. Something just doesn't seem right, so I'll take the Royals at home, plus the juice there. And by the way, if you wanna send in pics of your dog, we will profile them every time we do this segment, which isn't necessarily every day, just tweet me @DougESPN. Joe will be back momentarily, but one final look at Baxter, in charge, how awesome! PGA Tour, heading to Minnesota for the inaugural 3M Open at TPC Twin Cities. No surprise, Brooks Koepka, your favorite at eight to one. The only player with single digit odds. That's followed by Jason Day and Hideki Matsuyama, 11 to one a piece, Bryson DeChambeau, at 15 to one. Not posted here is lefty, Phil Mickelson at 40 to one. Let's welcome back Anita Marks here, to talk a little golf, given it is a Wednesday. She appears here on the show every Wednesday. Of the favorites, Anita, which one grabs your attention? 
- I'm going with Hideki, quick note here, 27 water hazards, 74 bunkers, that's what these guys are gonna be facing. And Hideki has been coming in red hot this season. This is a guy who has not missed a cut, Doug, not one all season long. He's in great form, he's red hot with his irons and each and every week, we talk about the analytics that's going to play well on this course. Birdie average, he ranks 10th on tour, par five scoring, he ranks 25th and also, strokes gained, tee-to-green, he ranks fourth on tour, so he's up there, top 25 in this category. He's gonna do exceptionally well. I like him, I'm putting some hard earned money on him. 
- Yeah, you liked him last week, did well, T-13, finished up there. What's another golfer that you think kinda grabs your attention, in terms of value? 
- Let's go to Patrick Reed, and he's coming in tied for fifth last week, so he's coming in hot and he's coming in with a lot of confidence, and when you look at what he's been able to do, the history in Minnesota. Let's go back to the 2016 Ryder Cup where he got that name, Captain America, because he took worry to the limit. His putting is a lot better and each and every week, we like to talk about the grass. It's bent grass this week, so the greens aren't gonna be as difficult as some of these guys have seen in previous weeks, so I like Patrick Reed. 
- All right, sounds good, can't let you get out of here without a DFS lineup, advice, fire away here. 
- You got it, as always, the two guys that I first talk about, my long, my short odds. I like to play them in DFS, as well. So, I'm going with Hideki and Patrick. Who am I gonna round it out with, DeChambeau, fifth in birdie average and par five scoring. His putting is finally coming back and he does extremely well with generous fairways and that's what he's gonna see, starting tomorrow. Niemann, back to back top fives, why? He has a new putting practice that he's been practicing with and it's really been helping him. Also, 31st strokes gained tee-to-green. Homa, this is another guy who just makes every cut 48th, par five scoring and here's the thing, three par fives, 593 yards, 596 yards, there's some long par fives. And Redman is coming in red hot as well, second last week with 19 under, on the tournament. This is his third PGA start and this very well could be, if he wins, this very well could be the fourth straight week on the PGA Tour that we have these really surprising great winners, so I'm always about that. I love the underdog, I love the unexpected, so I'm really, really, really cheering for Redman. 
- All right, sounds good. Anita, thanks for the insight, enjoy your holiday, and you'll be back obviously, on the show, on Friday. 
- Yes, I'll be in for you, Doug, so hopefully, you have a great weekend. 
- [Doug] Oh, I will, hit the road. And straight ahead on this show though, the greatest emcee in sports, George Shea, will break down tomorrow's Hot Dog Eating Contest. 
- And to me, that's the greatest honor of this sport, is to be able to introduce Joey Chestnut because to me, he is America itself, to me, he is freedom, he is the essence of who we are.

- [Doug] The championship is set for the Women's World Cup. Obviously, the Americans advanced today. Netherlands gets a go in the 99th minute, one-nil. So that is your showdown, and Caesars, just posting these odds, the Americans minus 475 to hoist the trophy. Now, three way betting will be out later, but just to win, no matter when it occurs. U.S., nearly a five to one favorite over Netherlands, so, that is Sunday. Let's get ready for tomorrow. It is a staple on our Independence Day, the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest. 
- And here is George Shea. 
- Through meditation, he learned that his spirit animal is a bologna sandwich. He has the body of Adonis, but the eating habits of Homer Simpson. 
- Doh! 
- He is not, as they say, book smart. In fact, if you ask him to name a country in Central America, he will say, Kansas? The difficulty in his marriage began after he named his children Mild, Medium, and Hot. His good cholesterol is low, his bad cholesterol is high, and his BMI is borderline presidential. When we are young, we drink our coffee with milk and sugar and as we age, we drink it with milk only. Then we drink it black, then we drink it decaf, then we die. Our next eatery is at decaf. It is an honor to all those now living, to behold this man. He is the fortress at the center of our nation. Of one nation, under God! Indivisible, he is champion, Joey Chestnut! 
- We're now pleased to welcome in the voice and the biggest personality of the July 4th Hot Dog Eating Contest, George Shea. George, thanks so much for taking the time. 
- Oh, thank you for having me. 
- All right, let's talk about it. Look, you've been with this event for three decades. You are an expert of all experts, so let's get into it. Joey Chestnut, he is synonymous here, a record 11 Mustard Belts. Is there any chance he does not win this event? 
- Oh, I think there's absolutely a chance he doesn't win, but I think the odds would be extremely low. Not only is he dominant in the sport, 74 hot dogs and buns last year, in 10 minutes, but on top of that, I saw him today. He looks absolutely in top form, he's very trim, very fit. He seems very healthy, and rested, and confident, so I think he's gonna be coming in strong. But at any time, he could be beaten and there are a couple guys, Geoff Esper and Matt Stonie, who could take him down. 
- Talk more about those two contenders, if you will. What makes them, what's the path to their success and beating Joey Chestnut? 
- Well, both of them have enormous capacity and Geoffrey Esper actually, has beaten Joey Chestnut, if I'm correct, two times in the last three weeks. He got him in Hostess Donettes and he got him in chicken wings, he's a monster. He's a relative rookie, second, third year on the circuit. I think he gets a little bit of the jitters going into the big contest on the Fourth of July. He ate 51 hot dogs to qualify. Keep in mind, the qualifying hot dogs are harder to eat, so you really have to think of him, up at a 60 mark or so. Then there's also Matt Stonie, he's really an internet star now, a YouTube star, eight million followers on YouTube. He does a bunch of challenges, enormous capacity, enormous capacity, but often people have said, he doesn't prepare for the contest and get ready. There's a rumor our there, and I can't vouch for it, but he's really gunning for Joey this year and he could bring some heat. 
- Okay, a couple of things to digest, forgive the pun. Qualifying hot dogs are harder to eat, why is that? 
- Well, if you think of it, you're at Nathan's, you're at the, sort of the mecca of hot dogs and they're cooked, perfectly cooked on the griddle. And they're cooked to come off of the griddle about 10 or 15 minutes prior to the contest. So they're the perfect temperature, they're warm, they're not cold, they're not hot. When you're out on the circuit, you might be at a festival, you might be at a ballpark, but bringing the hot dogs in, in warmers. They've been cooked a half an hour, an hour before. Sometimes they're not fully griddled. They're just cooked or they're steamed but they're not grilled as they would be at Coney Island, and as a result, they're more difficult to eat or it takes longer to eat those dogs. 
- All right, fascinating stuff on that fact. As you mentioned earlier, Chestnut ate 74 hot dogs last year. Do you see him hitting that mark or going past it this year, as well? 
- Well you know, I absolutely think he'll be around there. There have been times when things drop off, it could be the temperature of the day, it could be literally, the humidity. Actually, when you have a very, very dry day, it can dry out the buns. So even if they're only out there for five or 10 minutes, they have a different consistency. The hot dogs can tighten up more in the sun. So the temperature could play a role. 
- So, let's talk about the women's side. Micki Sudo going for a sixth straight Mustard Belt. What are the chances in your eyes, she does not make it six straight? 
- I think they're low, the chances that she does not win, but there could be more variability in her performance on that. So I do think it's possible that Juliet Lee or Michelle Lesco could make a real run at her. 
- The whole spectacle is awesome. I'm looking forward to watching it on July 4th. And George, it was an honor to have you here and I'm looking forward to watching your performance, as well. Thank you for taking the time. 
- Thank you, thank you for having me. 
- And on that note, we go to Prop Culture to wrap up the show. Joe Fortenbaugh joins me now and Joe, look, total of hot dogs on the men's division, 73 1/2 and this is interesting, I love what emcee George Shea just said about Matt Stonie, who he's hearing grumblings, that he's going to really bring it this year in his, of course, enormous capacity. I've been tracking this stuff for a long time, when I worked in Las Vegas. I got to do a live shot, downtown with the one and only, Joey Chestnut, and the one and only, Kobayashi. They were talking trash to one another, a lot of fun. I'm no expert but I'm saying under 73 1/2, if I had to, Joe. 
- Doug, let me start by congratulating you on a tremendous interview, Shades of David Frost and Richard Nixon, no doubt. Now, I'm going over 73 1/2 hot dogs and I got Joey Chestnut winning this thing. Doug, Joey Chestnut lives here in the Bay Area, where I live. The land of kale, the land of avocado toast, soda taxes. If you even think about having a cheeseburger, they wanna cast you out into the Pacific Ocean. Beautiful area, no doubt, but they are not too fond of noshing 73 1/2 hot dogs in 10 minutes. That's not how people do things here and yet, Joey Chestnut rises every day in the face of that adversity and he takes on his detractors. Let's go back to 2015, when he lost to Matt Stonie, 62 to 60. Came back the next year to set a record with 70 hot dogs, came back the following year to set a record with 72 hot dogs, and then came back last year to set another record with 74 hot dogs. This guy is not worried about his competition. He's worried about history and he has stated that his goal is to knock down 80 hot dogs in a single sitting. Doug, I say to you, God bless Joey Chestnut, God bless America. 
- (chuckles) And weather on your side, Joe, because it's gonna be a humid day and George Shea was just saying that, that lends itself to the over, because the buns won't dry out, but then I didn't think of asking him, a lot of the competitors dip the buns in the water, so I'm a little confused. I have certain thresholds for expertise on the Hot Dog Eating Contest but I do know this, I will be watching and this isn't like those other sports, like football and basketball, where you only have to watch the last few minutes. You have to watch the beginning because of George Shea and all the introductions and the pomp and circumstance, as well. So, Joe, we appreciate it. I know who you're rooting for here, your home town guy, and more importantly, happy Fourth of July and enjoy your holiday, my friend. And recapping our Best Bets, Preston in Vegas, Summer League, Grizzlies, minus 2 1/2. Joe's on the underdog Giants, plus $1.20. Stanford Steve laying the $1.38 with the Yanks, trying to bounce back in the Subway Series and I'll lay the run and a half with the red hot Dodgers.
