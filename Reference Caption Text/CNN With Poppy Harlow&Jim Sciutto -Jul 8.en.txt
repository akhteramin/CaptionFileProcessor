- Position for them. 
- Okay, Kimberly Dozier, thank you for the expertise. Appreciate it. 
- Thank you. 
- All right, it is the top of the hour. Good Monday morning everyone, I'm Poppy Harlow in New York. Jim Sciutto has a well-deserved day off. The breaking news we begin with this hour, federal prosecutors have just unsealed an indictment against Jeffrey Epstein. Inside it, the alarming details of how the politically connected billionaire allegedly ran a sex-trafficking ring. Epstein is accused of seeking out minors, paying cash to girls as young as 14 years old to have sex with him, and then paying them to recruit other girls for him to abuse. Next hour, these charges will be announced in public, a press conference will be held with prosecutors and the FBI. And then later this morning, Epstein will appear in court. Still unknown, what this case could reveal about his political connections, and they include a British royal, a former president, and the current one. Trump, who once called Epstein, quote. (audio dropping) We have team coverage this morning. Our anchor and national correspondent, Erica Hill, is here with me in New York. CNN crime and justice reporter, Shimon Prokupecz, is live outside of the courthouse. And Shimon. (audio dropping) Happening on Saturday. It was planned for today. 
- Pointed out. (audio dropping) These accounts also escalated. Also saying. (audio dropping) In some of Julie Brown's reporting we should point out the girls who, the victims who she spoke with, the alleged victims, talking about how they didn't know it going to, maybe, go that way. Or they maybe knew it wasn't right but they just, again, they were young. They didn't get it. And it also points out in the indictment that they believe, prosecutors believe, he did know their age and what was going on because some of these victims who are in here were asked specifically about their age and they said they didn't lie. 
- Let's talk about the powerful people in politics that were friends, are/were friends of Jeffrey Epstein. Including former president Bill Clinton, who, I think, records show, flew on his jet several times. President Trump is quoted with glowing words about him back in 2002. 
- He is, in fact, we have that from 2002, he talked about him to New York Magazine saying that he's a fun guy. I've known Jeff for 15 years, he said in 2002. Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It's even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it, Jeffrey enjoys his social life. Obviously, that's seen in a far different light today. But you're right, there is a connection here. You mentioned former president Clinton flying on his plane multiple times, being on his private island. President Trump reportedly at least once on his plane. The two reportedly dine together. At one point Epstein was actually a member at Mar-a-Lago and had been to Mar-a-Lago, but then was barred, at one point, after, according to court records, which Julie Brown also wrote about. He was accused of sexually assaulting an underaged girl there. 
- I would be remiss not to bring up with you the current Labor Secretary, Alexander Acosta, who is very tied to this. Because he was a big part of securing this sweet plea deal for Epstein back in 2008. That got him very little jail time. Charged with prostitution, not sex trafficking. And, by the way, that none of the victims knew about. 
- No, they didn't, so a couple of points there. Number one, you're right. So Alexander Acosta, at the time, was the US Attorney for the Southern District. So, he had to oversee this deal. He had to, basically, say, okay with a team of attorneys. At the time, he said well, you know, they lack the evidence to prove (audio dropping) violated federal law. There's been a lot of push back on that since. But he, essentially, had to sign off on it. Well, the DOJ is investigating how the case was handled. We should also point out that in February a federal judge said this deal broke the law because, to your point, victims didn't know about it. The terms of this deal, which it's been said multiple times are, basically, dictated by Epstein's attorneys, powerful attorneys. They didn't know about it. The deal was kept quiet, kept apart from the victims, until a judge had signed off for it. You can't do that, that broke the law. 
- Erica Hill, thank you, great reporting. Obviously, you'll be on this all day because he's going to be in court later this morning. Let's talk about legally where this goes. CNN Legal Analyst Renato Mariotti is here, former federal prosecutor. You're such a good voice for this because you have actually prosecuted sex trafficking cases before. One thing that Shimon said, outside the courthouse moments ago, that struck me is that what may be different this time, than the plea deal in 2008, if this goes to trial, is that they have three cooperators. And those are, apparently, some of the employees that arranged this travel of these underage girls to be with Epstein, et cetera. How significant is that? 
- Well, it's important. Frankly, I think the case is gonna rise and fall for the Southern District of New York on the testimony of those cooperators. These cases are very difficult to investigate they're very difficult to prosecute. Often, minors who are abused have difficulty coming forward and testifying. They have difficulty, essentially, going through and doing what they would need to do to be a witness in a case. Really, here, the testimony of the cooperators has to be strong in order for the Southern District to make it's case in court. What I think this indictment tell us is the the Southern District believes that they have testimony that can back these charges up. 
- When you look at the deal that was struck that raised so many questions, that the victims didn't know about. What do you think the questions are going to be now? Not only for Alexander Acosta, the current Labor Secretary who was a big part of this, but the judge who signed off on it. 
- I have to say, there are very significant questions about Mr. Acosta's actions there. Really, there has to be something very significant behind the scenes that caused that series of events. There's clearly misconduct by not informing victims. It appears, at some point, there was misrepresentations that were made to the court. Very serious misconduct by Justice Department attorneys. Victims need to know, particularly in cases like this. When I did investigate human trafficking cases and sexual abuse cases of minors, those victims are counting on you, as a prosecutor. They have a right to have access to you, they have a right to be heard. They are counting on you to prosecute and act fairly. 
- And it is interesting that the federal prosecutors working on this, that are going to hold this press conference in a little under an hour, are from the Southern District of New York's Public Corruption Unit. What does that tell you? 
- It could be a coincidence, it could be they just have time on their plates. But it also could mean that there is some tie to this case, either from the angle you just talked about or another, there's an obstruction, potential obstruction provision. Perhaps there is a public official that could, that is at least tangentially involved in this case and could become part of it later on. 
- Interesting, all really important questions to be answered. Renata Mariotti, thank you so much. Also this morning, as more images and reports come out of inhumane conditions at these migrant detention facilities along the southern border, the president says he now wants the media to go inside and see for themselves. With me now is our Kaitlan Collins she joins us from the White House and Natasha Chen in El Paso, Texas. good morning to you both. Kaitlan, the president says he wants this but there is a big difference between saying that and then the facilities actually letting in journalists with cameras unannounced. 
- Yeah, and so far they've been pretty hesitant, even not wanting lawmakers to bring their phones into those facilities. Of course, there are children there. So, whether or not that invitation is actually going to go forward is still an open question. But so far, the president and his aides have been downplaying the reports about these conditions at the border. Here's what the president said when he was on his way back to the White House, yesterday. 
- I'm gonna start showing some of these detention centers to the press. We're gonna have of the press go in and see it because they're crowded, and we're the ones who were complaining about they're crowded. 
- So, the president there going after, not only some of those Democratic lawmakers who have been reporting what they saw when they've toured these facilities. But Poppy, we should note, it's not just any one, singular report detailing these conditions that they say are widespread at these facilities. Conditions like overcrowding, some standing-room-only areas. People going without hot meals. But not only just from Democrats it's coming from a report from the president's own government. And a highly detailed and very specific report in The New York Times that came out yesterday and that people should read if they haven't seen it yet. 
- They absolutely should. And Natasha, you're there and you spoke to a Texas State Rep who says Border Patrol agents have been trying for some time to bring light to the conditions in Clint. Which is probably why a number of them were willing to speak to The Times. 
- Well, that's right Poppy. We were talking to Representative Mary E. Gonzales, she represents the Clint area where that facility is. She says that local leaders like herself in the community did not even know that children, unaccompanied children, were being processed through that facility, until news reports came out in the last month or so about the conditions inside. She said, some of these Border Patrol agents who live in this community, who have known her for a long time, they have been telling her about how demoralizing and depressing it is to work right now in those conditions, because of what they are seeing day to day with the migrants. They've also told her about how hundreds of children at one point, were being processed through that facility in a space that's really not designed for that many kids. And being held there for longer than they should be there with limited shower and shower facilities to wash up, limited microwaves to heat food to feed them. Here's what she had to say about her conversations with these agents. 
- A lot of the people I talked to who worked there were saying, we have been telling higher-ups there's a problem. And basically, those pleas have been ignored. A lot of the people who I talked to have been in the Border Patrol for decades, 23 years 24 years, this is something very new to them. They were never charged with being caretakers of children. At the end of the day, we have to realize that my community is struggling with a administration-made problem. 
- And Gonzales did say that she got to visit inside the Clint facility last week when there were far fewer children. Many of them have now been processed out. We did also hear from the Sector Chief of this El Paso region today, who said, now in this region they have only 26 children in custody. He disputes the reports of the inhumane conditions inside. But he does acknowledge it's very possible agents have been complaining about conditions and overcrowding in the past. He says, they've all been complaining that there are just too many children and not enough resources to process them through. 
- Thank you so much for the reporting, for talking to her. Natasha Chen, we appreciate and Caitlin Collins at the White House. All right, still to come. The Department of Justice is taking a new strategy as it pushes again to try to get a citizenship question on the upcoming census. We'll talk about that.

- All right, new team, new argument. After the Supreme Court ruled against the Trump administration's attempt to add a citizenship question to the census. This morning, the Justice Department says a different team of lawyers will now take up this battle. For more on why, Jessica Schneider, our Justice Correspondent, is here in DC. So, this is even after the Supreme Court ruled against them in this. The administration sees it as that important that they're putting a new team of attorneys on this. What does it mean and why does it matter? 
- That's right Poppy. So, this will be a new team that will now have to push a completely different set of arguments to try to get this citizenship question on the 2020 census. And we've learned that the political appointee who led the initial team of lawyers did in fact, think that it made sense to get a new team of lawyers on board because they are really doing an about-face here. It's a flip-flop that seems to have been forced by the president. Because, remember, it was less than a week ago that this fight seemed to be over. Lawyers from the DOJ's Federal Programs branch, told the challengers to the citizenship question that the census was going to print without the controversial question. And then, those lawyers told a judge that the decision was final. But then, of course, we saw that flurry of Tweets from the president and he insisted that he would push his administration to find a way to add this question. Now, DOJ lawyers admitted, just last week, to a Maryland judge in a hearing on Wednesday that they were really blindsided by the president's tweets, here. Especially since the DOJ has been insisting all along that a July 1st deadline to print this census was the absolute drop-dead deadline. And now, all indications are that the DOJ is continuing to press forward to find a rationale to add this question. Poppy, it is possible, I mean, the Supreme Court said, when they made that ruling, that if the Justice Department and the Census Bureau went back and provided some sort of rationale, possibly, this question could be added. But really, it seems the administration is running out of time here. They've already gone past their own July 1st deadline. Now, they could continue to push it forward but who knows if they would even have time to add it. Poppy. 
- You know, just your point, not to mention, you know, if they come up with a completely new rationale and reasoning, what will mean for Wilbur Ross's, the Commerce Secretary's testimony. When he talked about the rationale, et cetera. I guess if they win on this, what are they going to put? Like an insert in the census for everyone? I mean, actually, how would this play out? 
- Right, so logistically, that's sort of the big question here. The census, we know from DOJ officials, it has gone to print without that question. But could the administration somehow add on a citizenship question, by maybe, adding supplemental pages, supplemental questionnaires? You know, the president has floated the idea, even of an executive order to mandate that this question be added. But all of these options, Poppy, they're sure to face these continued legal fights. We're already seeing it on two fronts in federal courts in New York and Maryland here. And of course, we're running out of time because we're less than six months away from 2020 and the census needs to get out. Poppy.

- All right, this morning, Democratic, Freshman Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is hitting back at Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Pelosi criticized her and three other far-left Democrats for voting against that measure for border funding that eventually passed for those facilities, those detention facilities. Pelosi told the New York Times in an interview quote, All of these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world. But they didn't have any following. They're four people and that's how many votes they got. So, Ocasio-Cortez taking to, what else, Twitter, to fire back, calling Pelosi's decision to quote, Blindly trust the White House. Quote, A big mistake. Molly ball, is with me, National Political Correspondent for Time. And Tiffany Cross, Co-Founder and Managing Editor of The Beat DC. Good morning to you both. Tiffany, let me just begin with you. I mean, ideologically, these two, they're in the same party, but ideologically on this they could not be more divided. I do think it's interesting, though, that Nancy Pelosi has also said in the midst of all of this, criticizing the media. Saying, you know, you're focusing too much on division in the party, than on the issue at the southern border. We're focusing a lot on the issue at the southern border. But, how significant is this divide? 
- Well, I take the Pelosi's point, that I do think there is this, you know, continual drive that Democrats are out of step. But, listen, this is a healthy, generational shift happening within the party. And, quite frankly, I do, I'm not here to beat up on Nancy Pelosi, I think that she's, you know, achieved some congressional feats in her tenure, of course. But I do think, in this instance, that she did look a bit out of step with her party. If you remember, Poppy, at the time when she was going through campaigning and trying to be House Speaker again and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, one of the people who didn't vote for the border funding bill said, I'm going to vote for you but I did not come here to ask for your permission to lead. And this is what she is reckoning with now. These four women are not diversity hall decoration for Congress, but they are lawmakers intending to legislate and vote their conscience, rather, and reflect the views of their constituency. This is a major defeat for her because she's used to being able to whip her caucus and keep people in step. But, as this generational shift happens you're going to see this kind of discord on these occasions. And I don't think that's a bad thing for the party. 
- So Molly, it's interesting the line that really struck us in the Dowd piece in the Times. From Pelosi quote, If the left doesn't think I'm left enough, so be it. Will that work for her? Is that fine or will she have to answer more and more calls from the left? 
- Well, we'll see. I think that she's going to be increasingly tested by these divisions within the caucus. We're going to see this week as the debate heats up over Pentagon funding, whether she can keep those Liberal members in the tent. Her tactic has always been to, sort of, use the left to triangulate. Because she identifies as a Liberal. Because she's from one of the most Liberal districts in the country. Even though she is not nearly, I think, as Liberal as her district in San Francisco. She has always, sort of, especially since Republicans have spent hundreds of millions of dollars portraying her as the epitome of San Francisco Liberalism. She then takes that and says, well, they call me a Liberal, I guess I am, that means that I'm on your side. But, this is the most we can get done practically. I don't think this is really an ideological division so much as a tactical one. And what Speaker Pelosi is saying is, I understand that you have these ideas but are you working within the system? Are you working with in the process? So she's saying, you may have support out there on Twitter or in the real world, do you have support in the conference? And that's what we're going to see is are these Liberals willing to play hardball with the leadership? Are they going to make Nancy Pelosi's life more difficult? Because although there was a lot of complaining about that border bill, Nancy Pelosi did get her version through the House. And then she did get the Senate bill through the House. 
- [Poppy] That's true. 
- Can I just push back really quickly, Poppy? 
- Of course, yep. 
- I hear you Molly, I completely agree. But, I do think this actually is an ideological and a tactical division within these women. They're, all four, women of color who voted against this bill. The reality that, I think, there's trouble reconciling within this country is, if these were white babies being treated this way in these detention facilities. If these were white women being held in overcrowded facilities being told to drink from toilets. There certainly would be more of a national outcry. I think that's so important and resonating with these four women who said, we cannot trust this administration. And there's been continual evidence of Donald Trump misusing funds. I mean, we just saw in July 4th. But as a candidate and as a president he has misused funds. So, I think there is something about these women saying, why would we blindly trust this man? Why would we allow ICE to have more funding. We just found out today that ICE is using facial recognition technology. Well, states haven't passed laws to allow that. Undocumented immigrants, when they signed up they didn't know that they were turning their information over to ICE. I think these are relevant issues. 
- You're referencing the Washington Post reporting that says that ICE has been using facial recognition technology to scan photos at the DMV of driver's licenses, even of people not accused of committing crimes. And that raises a whole host of other questions, certainly. Molly, I found this attack, actually, on Nancy Pelosi from former Republican, now independent, Congressman Justin Amash of Michigan.

- All right, this just in to CNN. New York Governor, Andrew Cuomo, has just signed a law that would allow Congress to get a hold of President Trump's state tax returns. Of course, this comes amid the escalating fight with top administration officials and Congress, trying to get the president's federal tax returns. We'll see how this develops. 
- Equal pay. 
- Equal pay. 
- Equal pay. 
- Equal pay. 
- Equal pay. 
- Equal pay. 
- Well fans chanted equal pay as the Women's National Team received their World Cup medals after their second straight win on Sunday. The team is suing the US Soccer Federation over their pay and their star is speaking out about that suit this morning. Andy Scholes joins us with more. So much to celebrate there Andy, such a big win. But I would argue the bigger fight now, for them, is at home. 
- Yeah, that could be true, Poppy. But I'll tell you what, if there was ever a team that symbolized talking the talk and then walking the walk it is certainly this US Women's National Team. What we just witnessed from them was just an incredible performance. They had so much going on off the field. The fight for equal pay, Megan Rapinoe's back and forth with President Trump. But this team's still able to put it all aside and go out there and prove, once again, that they are the best team in the world. Team USA beating the Netherlands, two to nothing, yesterday in the final. They're on their way back to the US, right now, after leaving France earlier this morning. Here's a pretty cool pic they took together before boarding their plane. They're gonna arrive at Newark Airport at about 4:15 Eastern. They're gonna have a parade Wednesday morning in New York. Before leaving France, Rapinoe was asked, how their dominant performance will affect the US Federation's argument against them in their Equal Pay lawsuit. 
- It's not good for them, is it. (laughing) I mean, I think obviously, it's huge. I think we've been a little shy to say that, you know, putting so much pressure on ourselves because I think we have a case no matter what. Obviously, we brought the lawsuit. But this just, you know, sort of blows it out of the water. It's like, is it even about that anymore? Or is it just, kind of about doing the right thing. I think the Federation is in a unique position to, you know, kind of ride this wave of good fortune and get on board, and hopefully, set things right for the future. 
- Yeah, the players and the US Soccer Federation will head to mediation sometime soon, over pay. Over the past three years, the women's team has made more revenue than the men, despite being paid less. That being said, the men didn't make the World Cup last year and the money difference in the World Cup is staggering. The Men's World Cup in Russia last year made $6,000,000,000 in revenue and paid out 400 million to the teams. The Women's World Cup, meanwhile, is expected to generate only about 130 million in revenue, total. Paying out 30 million to the teams. There's no question, the women's team is more successful than the men here in the US. We all know their names, they sell more jerseys. But, right now, there's still just so much more money in men's soccer. We're gonna have to wait and see, Poppy, if the US Soccer Federation decides to give the women a pay raise. They certainly deserve it, after a fourth World Cup title. But in the past, the Federation has argued that the women's and men's teams are separate organizations that perform services for US Soccer. They have separate collective bargaining agreements and they have separate budgets that take into account different revenue that the team's generate. 
- Yeah well, you also have to be able to see the women's games in more places, Andy. I mean, there have been networks that have pulled their games, et cetera. So, come on. All right, before you go, let's talk about the 15 year old tennis phenom Coco Gauff, back in action. Right now, playing in Wimbledon this morning. How is she doing and just big picture, I mean, for so many of us, that aren't big tennis fans, she came out of the blue, superstar. 
- She certainly did and she is definitely a superstar in the making, Poppy. But right now, this morning, not looking good for her Wimbledon future. She lost the first set to world number one, Simona Halep, 6-3, down 5-2 in the second set. But she was actually in a similar situation when she made that big comeback on Friday. But Coco has just really become a crowd favorite at Wimbledon, after becoming the youngest to make it to the round of 16 in 28 years. She doesn't turn 16 till March. Just an incredible, incredible run. I mean, Poppy, when you were 15, could imagine doing something like this? I know I sure couldn't. 
- I don't know what I was doing at 15, nothing close to that, she is remarkable. Rooting for her. Andy Scholes, thank you. 
- All right.

- All right, so in just a few hours, president Trump will give a speech. As the White House puts it, quote, To recognize his administration's environmental leadership and America's leading role in the world. But his speech would follow major steps in his administration, to reverse over 80 environmental regulations put in place under the Obama administration. Let's talk about the facts here. Bill Weir, our Chief Climate Correspondent is with me. Also Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican, former EPA Administrator under the George W. Bush administration and former governor of New Jersey. Good morning to you both. All right, so we're going to hear from the administration on this today. And we'll get to, sort of, why they're doing this now, in a moment. But let me just outline for everyone what this administration's own EPA said in a report that came out in April. Here are the things that are happening because of the climate crisis and emergency. Hurricane storm intensity, frequency and duration will increase. More intense droughts, warmer temperatures, causing larger wildfires and longer fire seasons. And, they warned, this is the president's own EPA, to anticipate a combination of impacts, floods and fires which may be intensified because of the changing climate. From what you've seen, the evidence, not the rhetoric, is the Trump administration taking this seriously enough, at all? 
- No, not at all. And they're rolling back regulations in a whole lot of other areas that are making people lives less healthy. They're a threat to us in so many different ways. The climate crisis is just one of them and that's of course the huge, 800 pound gorilla. Pretending it doesn't exist doesn't stop it, that doesn't make it go away. 
- Even, no matter what you say in a speech. 
- Absolutely. 
- Here, in a few hours some of what's been rolled back, Bill, include, obviously, pulling out of the Paris climate agreement, that's a huge deal. Lowering the car emission standards that had been increased, right, to stop so much pollution. Weakening the Clean Power Plan from the Obama administration. Eliminating the EPA panel on air pollution and opening up Anwar, which you've done a lot of reporting on, in the Arctic. 
- Yeah, you know the president is old enough to remember when you could taste the air in Los Angeles. And when the Cuyahoga River in Ohio was on fire it was so polluted. And today, you can swim the Cuyahoga, it's beautiful. And you can go to LA and see the San Gabriel Mountains. But that that didn't happen on accident. 
- Right. 
- By accident. It didn't happen on its own. It happened when Nixon signed the Clear Air and Water Act. And then 40 years of deliberate lawmaking to grind this thing out, to get us where you can stand and say, hey, isn't the air really clear. New Zealand blows us away. Sweden has more beautiful cities. But what's lost in this clean air, clean water today messaging, is that he should be saying, step to the microphone and say, when Barron is my age, America is gonna be a completely, life as we know it will be completely different. 
- [Poppy] Because it is about our children. 
- It is. 
- It's about the future and he has a young child as you bring up. So listen to, obviously, the president has touted this and talked about America's air and water as being at a record clean, his words. And then the Vice President, Mike Pence, on with Jake Tapper just a few weeks ago made this argument, listen. 
- America has the cleanest air and water in the world. We'll continue to 
- That's not true 
- use market forces. 
- We don't have the cleanest air and water in the world. 
- I, I. 
- We don't. (chuckling) Well, you get back to me with some statistics that show it. 
- We're making progress on reducing carbon emissions. 
- I mean, Jake laughed because it is laughable. Because it's just not true. What are your concerns ahead of the speech when the administration is putting out, just blatant untruths about the environment. 
- My concern is that people seem to take what he says and say, okay, he may be lying. He may not be telling the whole truth but we don't really care. We've got to care. This is the moment when we really need to care about this and it is about our children and our grandchildren. It's about the future and about making our lives healthier. Making our our economy greater, which we can do and we've done it over time, as you pointed out, when we started the EPA with the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water, Safe Drinking Water. We saw the population grow exponentially. We saw the real GDP more than double. We saw our energy use climb and yet we were able to grow our economy at extraordinary rates. So it's not an either/or thing and we have got to get over this idea that it is and somehow doing away with regulation is gonna make everything happy. 
- I think that's a good point and Bill, you've done so much reporting on this. I mean, it doesn't have to be the case that protecting the environment hurts business. It means you transform business. 
- Absolutely. As the governor points out, we didn't go into a 40-year recession when we started worrying about breathable air, those sort of things. But the other thing that, you know, the big picture story that we're just not wired as human beings to worry about. We don't think in long earth-long time frames. We think of if, that noise behind that (audio dropping) is going to eat me, right. So, you don't think that. But if you take a step back and realize that every 2.7 seconds, a piece of the Arctic ice, about the size of a football field, turns to water. It's been that way for 40 years. So, again, Barron Trump will not get a 30-year mortgage in Miami, because it will change the actual, physical topography of our land. 
- The administration we hear, Bill, a lot, talk about natural gas and the push for natural gas and replacing coal, parts of coal with that and how that, you know, essentially, solves things. It helps, right, but it doesn't at all address the big issue, does it? 
- Well, everything's cleaner than coal. (chuckling) We could burn whales again and it's be cleaner, it'd be an improvement over coal. But it's still exacerbating the problem. And the governor can back me up on, just the numbers. As solar and wind has actually increased and gotten cheaper, it hasn't replaced fossil fuels. We just have a more voracious appetite, so we're burning everything. Solar, wind and. 
- Nuclear. 
- Nuclear should be part of this conversation. 
- I think the transition, is nuclear, is what we've gotta look at. Because we've got these nuclear reactors that produce no regulated pollutants or greenhouse gases while they're producing power. And we seem to be closing them down which is what, I think, is the problem. We're not gonna build any more new ones, big ones. But small, modular reactors, the rest of the world's going this way. We could create an enormous number of jobs. They'd be really good for the economy. That's the new wave, along with the renewables. And until the renewables, as Bill said, get to be base power, not just peak shaving, so they're on 24/7, then great, then we can go with that. 
- Governor Whitman, thank you. Bill Weir, thank you so much. We'll be watching. Again, the president's gonna give this address in just a few hours. You should watch it or read the entire thing. This just in, American tennis phenom, Coco Gauff's, magical run at Wimbledon has ended. She just lost in straight sets to former number one ranked player Simona Halep.
