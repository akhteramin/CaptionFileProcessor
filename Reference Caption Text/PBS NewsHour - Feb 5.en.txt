- This is State of the Union night, when the President makes an annual report to the American people, but it comes at a time of division here in Washington. The White House says President Trump will appeal for unity even as he holds to his demand for a border wall. Newly resurgent Democrats say the President himself is the problem. The split was clear at the Capitol today as Mr. Trump's supporters and opponents sounded off. 
- I think he's doing a good job, and I think he really is making an effort. He'll make some statements tonight that'll surprise a lot of people on the other side. I'm talking about conciliatory things and I think this comes from the heart. This guy is, he has a background that has shown him in different lights but it's always been successful. 
- Well, the President hasn't been acting on unity for two years up and down the line. He's always criticizing, dividing, and so if he calls for unity tonight, we'll have to say, let's see what happens tomorrow and the day after and the day after, because in the past he's called for unity and he's forgotten about it by the next morning. 
- The formal Democratic response tonight will come from Stacey Abrams of Georgia. She narrowly lost her bid last year to become that state's first Black governor and she's now a rising star in the Democratic Party. Let's turn now to our Lisa Desjardins at the Capitol and Yamiche Alcindor at the White House watching all of this. Yamiche, to you first. I've been talking to folks at the White House, much of it off the record. You've been talking to them too. What do we know for certain, or what do we think the President's gonna focus on tonight? 
- The President's gonna focus on unifying our nation and unifying both political parties, but some of course say that there's some credibility issues there because of his political track record of really offending and giving insults to his political opponents. The President is expected to talk about a number of topics including illegal immigration, health care costs, including trade, wars and foreign policy, as well as infrastructure. He's supposed to be, at some point, pitching and asking Congress to come up with some sort of infrastructure plan. The President's also supposed to be talking about HIV and trying to end the transmission of that deadly disease by 2030, and the President is also supposed to be talking about his ideas for a way forward, and it's really important though to remind people that the President has been tweeting today and he's been saying that Chuck Schumer's mad that he didn't win the Senate. He's also said in the past that Democrats don't believe in border security, so while the President puts forward this unifying message, there are people who are saying, well, just look at what you tweeted today. That's gonna be hurting that unifying message. 
- And Lisa, we know that the other party always prepares for what the President's gonna say. What are Democrats saying about how they plan to handle, what they expect the President to say and how they're gonna respond to it? 
- I have to tell you, Judy, Democrats are more excited about this response than I've heard them in some time. Stacey Abrams, to them, represents a shift away from playing it safe. In fact, there's one long-time progressive who told me tonight, we've been playing it too safe as Democrats. We want someone who has a clear, aggressive agenda like Stacey Abrams, who talks about voter rights. She also represents some other important themes for Democrats tonight. Diversity, in two ways. One, she will be the first African-American woman to give a major party response. Also, though, she will be the first non-elected official. She no longer holds office, having lost the gubernatorial race last fall. She'll be the first non-elected official to give this kind of response, so a sort of outsider and also a core part of the Democratic base. This also speaks to a theme that we'll see visually on the floor, Judy. Democratic women in the House will be wearing all white. They say that is to show kind of a sign, reference to the suffragettes, but it also, one of them told me, is a smart visual cue. They want to highlight the difference between Democrats and their increased diversity in this Congress, and Republicans who have less diversity this Congress. 
- And Lisa, staying with you, Yamiche mentioned the President is supposed to talk tonight about border security. What do we know at this point about where the conference committee working on that issue for the last several days. They have a deadline facing them. I talked today to Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader Schumer, they said they think progress is being made. What are you hearing? 
- My reporting is the same. Talking to other leaders and people who are on the conference committee, there is real progress. On the staff level, they think they could come up with a deal if it is just left to the members of the Appropriations Committee alone. Judy, the conference committee will have an unusual meeting tomorrow morning, closed doors, with career Border Patrol officials. Now, it's not clear why that's to be closed doors, but one staffer told me they think it's because they want the questions and answers to be as forthright as possible. They are looking at trying to get a conference report by the end of this week or this weekend at the latest. They think it's doable, but there are many X-factors, one of the biggest being the President and what he says tonight about border security. 
- And finally, Yamiche, what do we know about how the President is planning for tonight, and also traditionally the President has guests come to the Capitol. Who do we know those to be? 
- Well, the President is going to be using this national stage to make the case that the state of the union is great, but that it would be better if there were concerns met and concerns, and people paid attention to the concerns that he had. Right behind me at the White House, the President has been preparing and really using this speech as a way to prepare himself to talk on a teleprompter. He had a teleprompter actually brought into the White House so he's gonna be trying to make sure that he's reading properly. The other thing that he's gonna be doing is bringing in guests here. The guests that he's bringing in are one, a family that was, whose family member was murdered or killed by an undocumented immigrant. The President's also going to be bringing a little boy named Joshua Trump who was bullied because of his last name who, of course, he shares with the President, and the President's also going to be bringing someone who was freed by the Criminal Justice Reform Act that was passed by both parties, of course, supporting that bill, so the President's gonna be saying, we want bipartisanship and look at this person who came out of prison, he is embodying what we could be doing in the future. 
- Yamiche Alcindor at the White House, Lisa Desjardins at the Capitol, and we'll certainly be coming back to the two of you as the State of the Union gets underway later tonight when we have our special coverage. Thanks, and we wanna hear from lawmakers now. Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina is the third highest ranking Democrat in the U.S. House, and he joins us from Capitol Hill. Representative Clyburn, thank you very much for joining us. 
- Thank you. 
- Thank you. What are you looking for President Trump to say tonight? 
- Well, the President is asking us to choose greatness, and I would hope that we hear some greatness from him, but you know, I have been reading a lot of Joyce, of Alexis de Tocqueville of late, and Alexis de Tocqueville, in one of his writings, Democracy in America, told us that America's greatness is not because we are more enlightened than any other country, but because we've always been able to repair our faults. I would hope that the President tonight will demonstrate that kind of greatness, propose some things that we can do to repair our faults. They have been highlighted quite a bit in the last several months, and I am hopeful that whatever he says tonight will bring us together as a people, move us forward as a country, and make us really the genius of greatness. 
- Well, where do you see, Congressman Clyburn, there could be common ground, because what the White House says is, we've tried to make overtures to Democrats on border security. We haven't, they haven't met eye to eye with us, and they tick off a number of other issues where they say Democrats haven't been able to meet them halfway. What do you, where do you see potential common ground? 
- Well, I think there's common ground to be had on border security. The President seems to have backed away from his concrete 30-foot high wall and is now talking about more border security, he's talking about barriers, and we too have backed away from our positions of no money for any kind of wall. We are advocating a smart wall, using 21st century technology to make this wall as smart as we've made our telephones and our televisions, so we can have a smart wall, one that would use drones to keep anybody from flying over it, use X-ray equipment to keep anybody from getting around it, use scanners to keep anybody from burrowing under it undetected. So we can do this in a smart way. I just came back from Brownsville, Texas. We were at a port of entry, and I saw a port in dire need of retrofitting. I saw the fencing that's already there in dire need of repairing. I do believe that we can do what is necessary to secure our border. Just do it in a smart way, not to build a monument to anybody. 
- So to be clear, you're saying Democrats, and obviously as we said, you're third in line in the leadership in the House, the Democrats are prepared to support the money for some sort of physical barrier? 
- I said so long as it's done smartly. I believe that we will vote for whatever that committee comes out. If they come out with a bipartisan approach to get this done, irrespective of how they put it together, I do believe you'll get extensive support among Democrats for it. It may not be unanimous, but it'll be a lot of unity. 
- Are Democrats prepared to show respect to the President tonight? I ask that because we remember under President Obama, there were State of the Union addresses when members called out to him, once one of them calling him a liar. How do you see tonight going? 
- I think you'll see us being very respectful. You know, my dad used to teach us all the time that the first sign of a good education is good manners and so I try to put my education on display every time I walk into the halls of the Congress, or the House of Representatives. You may remember, when that yell was made, I'm the one that led the charge to get a resolution of disapproval for what my colleague said that night and it passed the House of Representatives and I think that we showed then that we disapprove of such actions and we certainly are not going to do anything to violate what we did last year. 
- Congressman Clyburn, finally, what other areas do you see Democrats and Republicans and the White House working together on this year? 
- Oh, I think that we can do a comprehensive infrastructure deal. I think we know that it's necessary for us to develop our rural communities. We need to be putting in water and sewage. We need to be repairing roads and bridges. We need to be building schools in our rural areas. We can do a comprehensive bill that would have broadband deployment going into these rural communities. Too many of them are being left behind. We need to make this investment. It will pay off handsomely if we do, and I really believe it can be done in a bipartisan way. 
- Congressman James Clyburn, who is the whip for the Democrats in the House of Representatives. Thank you very much. 
- Thank you. 
- And as we heard, President Trump is expected to double down in his speech tonight, calling on Congress to fund a wall, a barrier along the southern border. One option he has not ruled out, declaring a national emergency to build the wall. That is causing a split among Senate Republicans. Senator Lindsey Graham warned yesterday that there could be a war within the GOP over the wall. We turn now to one of the President's most loyal allies in Congress. He is Senator David Perdue of Georgia. Senator, thank you very much for joining us, and I think you are there. There you are. Senator, how much of a divide is there still, do you think, between Republicans and Democrats, between Democrats and the White House over what is going to happen with regard to a barrier, a wall at the southern border? 
- Well, I hope that it's narrowing, Judy. I mean, this is a situation where we're dealing with a topic that both sides are making the same argument. This is the fifth President in a row that's asked Congress for border funding to build a wall. H.W. Bush built the first miles, even Barack Obama built 135 miles of wall. Both parties agree that this is a national security issue, and we need to do it now. The problem is the hypocrisy of politics have brought us to this point. I'm hopeful that this conference committee is going to get to a bipartisan solution here that we can all support, and I'm hopeful they will, Judy. 
- Well, as you know Senator, during the campaign over two years ago, the President was talking about a wall. At times he spoke about a concrete wall, at times he spoke about sea to shining sea. The President has changed what he's asking for, isn't that fair to say? 
- Well, this is a man who's, number one, trying to protect the American people. He's fighting for our national security. There's 2,000 miles of that southern border. 650 miles, Judy, already have some sort of barrier on it, and he's asking for a little more than 200 miles, so I think that puts it in perspective, but he wants it to be put in positions where drug trafficking, human trafficking, and illegal immigration is happening in the most severe manner right now. 
- Do you see the Democrat, from what you know, we just heard Congressman Clyburn say he believes there can be success in that conference committee, that left to their own devices they can come up with an agreement? Do you, are you optimistic that's gonna happen as well? 
- Well, I'm hopeful. I'm not sure I'm optimistic yet, but I'm very hopeful. We'll know tomorrow, because some experts from the border, these are non-political bent people who are coming up to give some advice to the committee, I'm hopeful tomorrow we'll hear some statements coming out of that conference committee that'll give us some optimism about getting past this impasse. Look, the other thing, Judy, is that this is ridiculous. This is a appropriation issue that should have been dealt with before September 30th of last year. We're in the fifth month of our new fiscal year, so I'm hopeful that everybody will sober up here in Congress and get this done this week. 
- I think you know, Senator, the President is still not ruling out the idea of declaring a national emergency in order to go ahead and build the wall, put money aside to build the wall if there's no agreement in Congress, but he's been told by Senate Majority Leader, your colleague, Senator McConnell, Mitch McConnell, that that's not a good idea. Do you think the President still would seriously consider doing that? 
- Well, he has said he would and I take him at his word, but, again, this is a man. I think tonight in the State of the Union, you'll hear President Trump offer a little more conciliatory tone because he's a dealmaker first and last, we all know that. He just wants to get border security moving in the right direction and both parties actually want that, so I'm hopeful that tonight, we'll see a little more of that and then over the next week or so, we'll see something come out of this conference committee that will preclude the need for the President to do something extreme like that. He certainly has the right to do it, but I'm hopeful Congress will step in here and do its job. 
- Senator, how much, how does it change what the President can do because Democrats have now won the majority in the House of Representatives, that he's dealing with a different Congress than he was last year? 
- Well, we have a historic opportunity. If you think about Tip O'Neill and Reagan, you think about Newt Gingrich and Bill Clinton, when you had split government is when really big things did happen here, so the answer is, Nancy Pelosi has a choice as the Speaker. Either she's gonna work with this President, who's been proven that he will make a deal. I mean, we did a historic bipartisan Dodd-Frank bill just this past year, Judy, that really helped small banks. I'm looking for more of that, so I think the Speaker has to make a decision. Is she gonna legislate with this President, who's more than willing to do that, or is she just gonna investigate going into the Presidential election in 2020? 
- But my question is how does it change what the President is able to do? 
- Well, if they don't operate with us, then it moves back in the Senate, and all we're gonna be focused on are confirmations and Leader McConnell has talked about being more aggressive about getting the confirmations done this year and next, so we know we can do that. That's in the hands of the Senate. I just implore the Senate, or the House members, to put pressure on leadership there to, let's get together and legislate, which is why the people in America sent us up here. 
- There's a report out in the last few days, Senator, about the Trump administration still not having submitted names for hundreds of empty positions inside the administration. Do you have an explanation for why that is? 
- Well, yeah. We've had a historic level of obstruction, first of all. Let's put it. 
- [Judy] No, I'm talk. 
- No, I understand. The good news is is that we have done over, we've confirmed over 85 judges, 30 Courts of Appeal judges, and two Supreme Court Justices because the party was set there, but this is a historic situation, Judy, where this is the first time in U.S. history the minority party has not waived the 30-hour rule in the Senate. Now, having said that, there are over 300 nominations at the end of last year waiting to be confirmed. We just need to get down to business and get past this and stop playing partisan politics. This President is, if we don't change the rule, and we don't move past this, this President won't even be able to put his full complement of government together in the first term of his office. 
- Yeah, I'm asking about those positions for which names have not even put forward yet. 
- Well, first of all, Judy, there are plenty of names that have been put forward that have not been brought forward because we can't get to them because of the obstruction of the Democrats in the Senate, and when that happens I can promise you this President will line 'em up in terms of the nominees waiting to be confirmed. 
- Senator David Perdue of Georgia, thank you very much. 
- Thanks, Judy. 
- So, let's take a step back now and put this moment in tonight's address in context with Presidential historian and NewsHour regular Michael Beschloss. Michael Beschloss, wonderful to see you. 
- Wonderful to see you always. 
- Thank you for being here. 
- Thank you, Judy. 
- So, you've looked at how Presidents have handled times of stress, times when they are facing opposition, whether new or long-standing. That seems to be, certainly, what President Trump is facing tonight. How have other Presidents handled it? 
- Well, oftentimes they've made a pivot. I mean, Bill Clinton, for instance, in 1996 was about to run for reelection and two years earlier, he had lost Congress to the Republicans, first time in 40 years. That was a very big event, so he said, we remember it now, the era of big government is over. That worked for him because people knew that for the year since the election, he had been moving steadily to the right or at least to the center, so when he said those words it had some meaning, helped to position him to run successfully for reelection and also, I was so interested that Senator Perdue was talking about Newt Gingrich and Bill Clinton. That State of the Union set that up for Clinton and Gingrich, by the summer of 1996, to do welfare reform together, to balance the budget. It really changed the political atmosphere. 
- So is there a precedent, Michael Beschloss, for Presidents who've been at loggerheads with a Congress turning the corner and setting the stage for there to be real, an ability to work together? 
- Yeah, absolutely. 1947, Harry Truman went to give the State of the Union after he lost Congress to the Republicans for the first time in 16 years. He knew that there was a big necessity for him to make deals with the Republicans to prepare the nation to fight the Cold War and to try to get some of the domestic laws that he wanted. He failed at the latter. 
- Do you sense, again from you studied history, studied so many Presidents, that there is a willingness, a will, on the part of these two parties that have been fighting each other for week after week, day after day, to come together? 
- I think they know that an awful lot of Americans would like to see that. That surely shows up in the polls, but there hasn't been much sign of it during the last month and we will see if this speech changes the atmosphere. I think rarely in history does that happen. 
- And that's what I want to ask you about, too. How much difference can one speech, one, granted this is a big deal, it's the State of the Union. There's a whole lot of tradition wrapped around this. 
- Sure. 
- Can one address make a difference? 
- If people have the feeling that lurking within Donald Trump has been this deep desire to make deals with the other side that hasn't expressed itself, and he talked about it a lot during the campaign. 2016, a lot of people voted for Trump did so because he said, I know Chuck Schumer, I can make deals with him, and they feel in many cases that it hasn't been expressed, if we begin to see signs of that Donald Trump in the wake of this speech, things could begin to change. I'm not predicting that. 
- Are you, why not? 
- Because this speech was preceded by an enormous confrontation, one of the biggest in legislative White House relations history that led to a shutdown, may yet again. 
- And just very quickly, you've looked at the language this President uses, the way he communicates with the American people. Do you, how much do you expect him to stay in that lane, and how much might he? 
- Not for long. He doesn't enjoy it, we haven't seen many instances of it. If we did, the time we would have seen it would have been in the inauguration when even the most partisan Presidents usually give a really unifying speech. He'd be the first to say he did not. 
- Michael Beschloss, thank you. 
- My pleasure. 
- Nice to have you. Appreciate it. And now, some perspective on the run-up to tonight's big address from opposite sides of the American political spectrum. Karine Jean-Pierre is a senior advisor for MoveOn.org and Chris Buskirk is the editor of the conservative journal and web site American Greatness. Hello to both of you. 
- Hi. 
- Hi, Judy. 
- Great to have you back on the program. Chris, to you first, Chris Buskirk. What do you expect the President to do tonight? 
- I think what the President's gonna do tonight is he is going to do what he's done, I think pretty well in some speeches before, which he's going to go back to promises made, promises kept. Here's what I talked about in my campaign, here's what I've accomplished so far, here's what I still need to do, and I think that, here we are halfway through the first term, right. This has got to be the pivot to reelection, so try to start to set the tone and set the trajectory for a message that's going to carry him through November of 2020, and I think that needs to be one big unifying theme that says, on immigration, on trade, on foreign policy, how are all these things linked together? What's that unifying theme? And I think that that theme has to be how do you rebuild the middle class, that's number one, and I think that that's what he's gonna try and do. 
- And if that's what he does, Karine Jean-Pierre, how is that received by Democrats? 
- So, I know that it's been reported that, from the administration, from the White House, that the President is going to give a speech on unity, on greatness, on bipartisanship, and that would be great if he was able to do that, but we haven't seen that from this President in the past, now going on three years, and I just don't see the speech, only because of his history, of his record, being that impactful, so maybe, maybe he gets there and he makes a unity speech, but hours later, the moment he gets on Twitter, it all, he steps on it. So, I just, it's hard to believe and let's not forget, a couple weeks ago, he gave, he addressed the country in a diplomatic reception room where he talked about immigration, and that was filled with division, and then he did it weeks prior to that in the Oval Office behind the Resolute desk and that was filled with division and hate, so I just don't see how that's possible coming from this President. 
- And in fact, Chris Buskirk, I had a chance today to spend a little bit, a few minutes with Speaker Pelosi and the Senate Minority Leader, Chuck Schumer, and Mr. Schumer made a point, Senator Schumer made a point of saying, we hope the President's going to appeal to unity, but in the past, when he's spoken at a moment whether it's the State of the Union address or another speech, he's made promises or made declarations that he then turned around and didn't fulfill, so what makes you convinced that tonight is gonna be different? 
- Well, I think part of that's in the eye of the beholder, right. What is unity? I mean, there's part of it that is the art of persuasion, which is to talk about it and to use the rhetoric of unity and to talk about how do we, how are we Americans together, what does that mean and how do we build things together, make this a better society. How that translates into practice, I think, is where the President needs to be very concrete. He needs to use that rhetoric, but then say, look, these are the policies we're gonna pursue in my administration to try and make this a reality, and that's what everybody's really looking for. It's nice to hear the good speech, but then what are you gonna do about it? 
- But you have a sense that now, Chris Buskirk, the President's prepared to do that? 
- I think he has to, and I think that's what he's gonna try and do. 
- But, Karine, you're expressing doubt. 
- I, he just doesn't have a record of it, Judy. We have not seen that. A year ago, he talked about unity. What did we get months later? We got the zero policy situation where children were being ripped away from their parents, children of undocumented immigrants coming through the southern border, and that was devastating to see and now we're hearing many of them will never be reunited, and the year before that, in 2017, in the joint address, the same thing, and what did we see? We heard about Charlottesville and what did he do there? He said, very fine people on both sides. I just don't see it. 
- When you hear this, Chris Buskirk, what do you think? 
- I think that unity does not mean agreement on everything and that's okay, that's what politics is for. I think what unity means is not that Donald Trump says, well, to Speaker Pelosi, okay whatever you want, that's fine. I think what it means is how do we identify the problems that the country faces and then how do we work together where there's agreement and then we can disagree on other things too, but let's do that in a way where we at least try and set the table on common goals. 
- And I guess the flip side of the question, Karine Jean-Pierre, is are Democrats or people like you who work hard with organizations. 
- Yeah. 
- Who oppose so much of the President's policies, are you willing to give the President the benefit of the doubt? 
- There are things that we can work on that's bipartisanship, which is DACA, infrastructure, improving. 
- [Judy] Which is immigration. 
- Immigration, right, for young undocumented folks who came here with their parents when they were really young and there's also the criminal justice, right? That was done in a bipartisan way. It was a first step, and there's more to be done. The problem is, and what we said earlier, he declares things in his speech but then he doesn't stick to them and I think Democrats are ready to work on those things I just mentioned, but he doesn't stick to it. 
- I want to look at this, step back a little bit, Chris Buskirk, because part of what's going on here is that many of the people who support the President don't seem to want him to cooperate with the other side and Karine, I think you could say that about a number of progressive liberal Democrats who don't want to see their party cooperate. What about that, Chris? 
- Well, the best way for me, at least, to think about it is to use a concrete illustration. So you think about the immigration issue. I mean, this is a place where people like Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader Schumer, you know, 10 years ago, 12 years ago, they were talking, yes we need a wall, we need border security. I think what the President needs to do is explain why that's important and how that is something that protects, how border security protects working families, American working families. Why, because it protects their most valuable asset, which is their asymmetric access to the American labor market. Make that argument, maybe in a more. 
- [Judy] In other words, immigrants take jobs away from you? Is that, I mean? 
- Take jobs away, lower wages. I mean, more supply equals, more supply lowers prices. That's basic. You explain that to people and say, look, this is why immigration's important to me, or this is why trade policy's important to me, 'cause I want middle income families to be secure economically and they to be able to prosper. 
- And Karine, the flip side of that. Liberal Democrats don't want their party leaders to work together with the President. 
- Well, they want Democrats, in particular in the House now that it's the majority, to hold this President accountable, and that's one of the reasons that we took back the House, and so that's really important, and that looks in very different ways, right? That's looking at this Mueller report. That's also looking at, as I mentioned, the children being separated at the border, Puerto Rico, 3,000 people died, but they also want to see Democrats moving the country forward, right, and they've done that with voting rights and dealing with corruption and so those are things that they actually want to see, but we need Republicans on the other side to do, to also in there with us, too. 
- All right, we're gonna have a chance to talk about all this again later tonight when we've heard what the President has to say. Thank you so much, Karine Jean-Pierre, Chris Buskirk. 
- Thank you. 
- Thank you. 
- And now for a roundup of today's other main headlines. Here's Amna Nawaz. 
- In the non-State of the Union news today, the White House played down a federal subpoena seeking a host of documents from President Trump's inaugural committee. Federal prosecutors in New York are investigating who gave the money and what they might have received in return. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders called it hysteria over the fact that Mr. Trump was elected. 
- This doesn't have anything to do with the White House, and I think the biggest focus and the thing that most Americans care about has nothing to do with the inaugural and it has everything to do with what the path forward looks like. 
- Investigators are also looking into whether any foreign donors illegally contributed to the inaugural committee. One of President Trump's judicial nominees voiced regrets today for her past statements on rape, race, and equal rights. Neomi Rao appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Senators on both sides criticized her for writing in college that women bear some blame if they're sexually assaulted while intoxicated. 
- To be honest, looking back at some of those writings and rereading them, I cringe at some of the language that I used. Now, I've had a lot of experience since that time writing in college, and I don't think I would express myself in the same way. These are horrible crimes, and I wouldn't write anything that might be implied to blame a victim or make it less likely for a victim to come forward. 
- Rao currently leads the White House office overseeing deregulation. If confirmed, she'd take the federal Appeals Court seat held by Brett Kavanaugh before he joined the Supreme Court. Overseas, in Afghanistan, Taliban attacks killed nearly 50 people in two northern provinces. A pre-dawn raid killed 26 soldiers and police at an army base in Kunduz province, on the outskirts of Kunduz City. Attacks in neighboring provinces killed 21 others. The Taliban have kept up their offensive, even amid early stages of peace talks with the U.S. The top U.S. commander in the Middle East says President Trump did not talk to him before announcing American forces will withdraw from Syria. Army General Joseph Votel testified at a Senate hearing today and was questioned by Maine Senator Angus King. 
- General, were you aware of the President's intention to order the withdrawal of our troops from Syria before that was publicly announced? 
- I was not aware of the specific announcement. Certainly we are aware that he had expressed a desire and intent in the past to depart Iraq, er, I meant Syria. 
- So you weren't consulted before that decision was announced? 
- [Votel] We were not, I was not consulted. 
- Votel's remarks came a day after the Defense Department warned that Islamic State fighters could resurge in Syria after the U.S. withdraws, and this afternoon the Senate approved a Middle East security bill that warns against any sudden pullout from Syria or Afghanistan. It also calls for new sanctions on Syria. Pope Francis has celebrated the first ever Papal mass on the Arabian peninsula. Some 180,000 people gathered today at a sports stadium in Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates. Francis preached humility in one of the world's richest nations. 
- [Papal Translator] For Jesus on the other hand, blessed are the poor, the meek, those who remain just, even at the cost of appearing in a bad light, those who are persecuted. He taught us that greatness is not found in having but rather in giving. 
- Later, the Pope acknowledged, for the first time, the scandal of priests sexually abusing nuns. He said he's committed to fighting the problem. Millions of people, meanwhile, in Asia and around the world marked the Lunar New Year today. In Taiwan, thousands gathered to pray at a Buddhist temple. In the Philippines, people bought roasted pig, a delicacy, to usher in the Year of the Pig, and all across China, crowds visited temples and took part in festivals. Back in this country, Texas lawmakers complained today the state still has not received Hurricane Harvey recovery funds. The storm did major damage in 2017 and last February, Congress earmarked some $4.4 billion for Texas, but no grants have actually been made. The state's Republican senators plus 10 House members from both parties say federal budget bureaucracy is what's standing in the way. An outspoken critic of the World Bank, David Malpass, looks like he'll be President Trump's choice to lead the agency. It was widely reported today that the President will nominate him this week. The World Bank provides loans and projects around the world, but Malpass has complained it's piling up debt without results. Also today, Andrew Wheeler won a Senate Committee's approval to be head of the EPA. His nomination now goes to the full Senate, and on Wall Street, a series of strong earnings reports gave stocks another boost. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 172 points to close at 25,411. The NASDAQ rose 54 points, and the S&P 500 added 12. Still to come on the NewsHour, reaction to the President's comments that the U.S. will use a base in Iraq to keep eyes on Iran. A rigorous program prepares Black undergraduates to go on to medical school. Plus, SAS Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah gives her brief but spectacular take on fearlessness. 
- As we reported, the top U.S. military commander for the Middle East was on Capitol Hill today. In addition to the fight against ISIS, he was asked about recent comments by President Trump suggesting American troops in Iraq could shift their mission, and as Nick Schifrin reports, those comments about U.S. troops watching Iran have sparked deep concern in Iraq. 
- [Schifrin] Near the Iraqi-Syrian border, an Iraqi soldier and his American advisor line up artillery to strike ISIS. Outside Baghdad, U.S. Special Operations forces train Iraq's elite counterterrorism service, and Iraqi soldiers learn to fire American rifles from anti-ISIS coalition troops. These scenes of partnership, filmed by the U.S. military over the past year, show what Iraq has invited the U.S. to do. 
- [Soldier] Fire! 
- [Schifren] 5,200 troops train Iraqi security forces and target ISIS fighters who lost territory but resumed insurgent tactics, but this weekend, President Trump told CBS's Margaret Brennan the mission should expand. 
- And one of the reasons I want to keep it is because I want to be looking a little bit at Iran, because Iran is a real problem. 
- Whoa, that's news. You're keeping troops in Iraq because you want to be able to strike in Iran? 
- No, because I want to be able to watch Iran. All I want to do is be able to watch. 
- [Schifren] But even watching Iran exceeds the tasks Iraq has approved. Today Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi, who has been working with the United States, criticized President Trump. 
- [Iraqi Translator] I don't think that such statements are useful. In fact, they won't help much and I hope that he would back down from them. 
- [Schifren] In a statement, First Deputy Speaker Hassan al-Kaabi repeated a vow that Parliament would pass a law terminating the security agreement with America, in addition to ending the presence of American military trainers and advisors and foreigners on Iraqi soil, and on a Lebanon-based TV network on Sunday, Iranian-backed militia spokesman Jaafar al-Husseini hinted militias had the capacity to evict the U.S. 
- [Iranian Translator] All of our options are open in front of us. We have the ability and resources to execute them. 
- What the President's remarks have done is to make it more difficult for even America's closest allies and the Iraqi political class to continue to advocate for the American presence in Iraq. 
- [Schifren] Feisal Istrabadi is a former Iraqi diplomat and directs Indiana University's Center for the Study of the Middle East. The Iraqi Parliament was already debating a bill that would evict the U.S. That momentum will increase and put pressure on Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi, who leads a government considered technically capable but has no natural constituency. 
- He was turned to by the political parties in Parliament and asked to form a government. He is in that sense a relatively weak Prime Minister and you don't want the Prime Minister in a political battle with Parliament because in the Iraqi system, the Prime Minister will always lose. 
- [Schifren] Today the top commander in the Middle East, General Joseph Votel, tried to reassure that the U.S. Respected Iraqi wishes. 
- Our military mission on the ground remains very focused on the reason that the government of Iraq asked us to come there. 
- [Schiffren] And he suggested the President's comments had not become a military order. Virginia Democrat Senator Tim Kaine. 
- And as far as you know, there is not a change in the definition of the mission, at least as far as the Pentagon is concerned? 
- I have no additional tasks that have been given to me with regard to that. 
- If the U.S. were to change its definition of the mission in Iraq to be a mission about watching Iran, wouldn't it be pretty important to have Iraq agree that that would be the focus of the mission if we were to be having troops in their country to carry out such a mission? 
- Senator, we are in Iraq at the invitation of the government, so yes I agree. 
- I think that this statement is not enough. 
- [Schiffren] Abbas Kadhim leads the Atlantic Council's Iraq Initiative and recently met with President Salih. Kadhim says thanks to President Trump's statement, Iran's powerful allies can now use the Iraqi constitution to argue against U.S. presence, because it requires Iraq to adhere to the principle of noninterference in the internal affairs of other states. 
- Iran has more friends inside Iraqi Parliament, and also inside the government and inside even the public and these friends are willing to indulge Iran. Before Sunday, they did not have the votes. Now I am told by some Parliament members that they have the votes at least to have it pass through the first reading. That is a major shift. 
- [Schiffren] Iraqi leaders admit they knew all along U.S. troops in Iraq were likely conducting extra missions, even watching Iran, but until Sunday that was never made public. 
- That veil of plausible deniability or willful ignorance, whatever you want to call it, that's been lifted. The President of the United States has blatantly announced what his agenda actually is. 
- [Schiffren] And that means, for the U.S. and Iraqi officials whose agenda is to improve Iraq, their mission became much harder. For the PBS NewsHour, I'm Nick Schiffren. While Virginia's governor Ralph Northam weighs whether to resign, reaction and anger keeps building over the racist photo in his medical school yearbook. One important part of that is how it serves as a reminder of racism in medicine historically. We reported on the importance of training more African-Americans to become doctors, and tonight we have a second look at a story on Xavier University. It's a small, historically Black college in New Orleans that's helping lead the way. Hari Sreenivasan reports on what sets the school apart for our education series, Making the Grade. 
- Can any of y'all come up to the board and describe the glycolysis cycle, like write it out? 
- [Sreenivasan] On the campus of Xavier University, 18-year old Chris Webb leads a biology review the night before a major test. 
- All you really need to know. 
- [Sreenivasan] Webb is helping fellow freshmen who, like him, are enrolled in a rigorous pre-medical program. 
- I want them to do as best as they can. 
- [Sreenivasan] The scene is a familiar one on the campus of Xavier, a historically Black college in the heart of New Orleans. 
- So what's the second stage in aerobic respiration? 
- The second stage is formation of acetyl coenzyme A. 
- Okay. 
- [Sreenivasan] Students quiz each other on material from tough science classes, the kind of courses that often weed out pre-medical students. 
- I don't want them to do better than me, but when they do, that just makes me realize, okay this competition is really serious. While we're having fun, it's also very real. 
- There are just over 3,000 students at Xavier University, but the school manages to graduate more African-Americans who go on to become doctors than any other school. That includes elite public universities and the Ivy Leagues. That number is even more striking given a drop in Black males applying to medical schools. According to a recent report from the Association of American Medical Colleges, fewer Black males are applying to medical schools now than in 1978. Reynold Verret, Xavier's president. 
- We do not compete to say who's better. It's almost like a relay race. The goal is to finish together, so our students actually embrace and encourage each other to achieve. 
- That turns on its head traditional pre-med programs. 
- Oh yes, it does. 
- Which is look to the left, look to the right. 
- One of you's gone. 
- [Sreenivasan] Right? 
- Yes. We want to get through because the competition is actually after we leave Xavier, not here. The point is to get out there together. 
- [Student] Glucose make two. 
- [Sreenivasan] Call it competitive collaboration. Head of student advising Quo Vadis Webster. 
- At some schools, you say look to your left, look to your right, this person may not be here. Here, we say look to your left, look to your right, you better help the person next to you so that we can all make it. 
- [Sreenivasan] The intense student advising starts early. 
- How are you, my dear? 
- [Student] I'm great, how are you? 
- Good, everything is filled out? 
- [Sreenivasan] Incoming freshmen begin crafting medical school applications, even before their first day as an undergraduate. 
- Before classes start, we go over a different aspect of the process of preparing a competitive application to medical school. 
- And you're starting before they actually walk in the door? 
- Have to. You need six semesters at least, 'cause that's six semesters before you apply. You need every last one of those semesters and summers to put into making yourself a competitive applicant. 
- One of the phosphates is broken off. 
- [Sreenivasan] The pre-med program also relies heavily on tutoring by upperclassmen. Bradley Dunn says he could not have made it through his first semester without the free tutoring center. Dunn's student tutor, Chinyere Jones. 
- Basically, whenever he had a break, he was in the tutoring center. I was like, geez. 
- [Sreenivasan] Dunn believes students helping students comes in part from shared experiences about race. 
- They're able to understand the plight of African-Americans. It's more relatable and it's more intimate, and we all know the pitfalls that we may face as people, and together we're a unit, and I'm actually taking pride in that blackness. 
- The second part of that question, that's the one I didn't necessarily understand. 
- [Sreenivasan] Race is also an important factor for Chris Webb, who chose Xavier over full scholarships to other universities including Vanderbilt and Tulane. 
- Seeing people that looked like me and getting to med school and through med school, it motivates me more competing with people that are like me. 
- [Sreenivasan] One of those role models is Dr. Ryan Jupiter. 
- All right, if you don't mind, I'm gonna take a listen to you right now. 
- [Sreenivasan] Jupiter is a resident doctor in the emergency department of New Orleans University Medical Center. A Xavier alumni, he visits campus regularly to tell students his own story as the first in his family to go to college. 
- I wanted to make sure that I could look like I do and still be able to become what I want to be. 
- [Sreenivasan] How important is that? I mean, do you think that young black men don't see that enough? 
- Definitely, I don't think they do at all. It's a long journey, and when you see other people who put in the time and the work and see the results of it, then it kinda helps with the long struggle that it takes. 
- [Sreenivasan] When we met Dr. Jupiter, he had his monogrammed jacket on, which he took off for our interview, but he explained how he normally wears the jacket in the hospital because it is one more visual cue to patients that he is a physician, something he says people don't always expect from a young black male. 
- [Sreenivasan] Have you been mistaken for something other than a doctor? 
- All the time. It happens. I don't think it's intentional. I would like to think it's not intentional, but it's very rare that you can walk into a room as a patient and when you see a Black, African-American male with dreads in his hair, that this is my doctor until you formally introduce yourself, or you will get the comments. Nurse, or can you get this for me, or are you here to clean the room, so to speak, those things have all happened. 
- [Sreenivasan] Students at Xavier hope to change those stereotypes. 
- We all recognize that people don't truly see us for who we are, and we use that to motivate ourselves and to try to show people, we're a lot more than what you take us for. 
- As African-Americans, we're known to be great at sports, but we can be so much greater in other areas, and I just feel like we need to be more represented. 
- [Sreenivasan] There's a bright spot for minority trends in the field. The number of Black women applying to medical school is on the rise. 
- Black women have something to prove. 
- [Sreenivasan] Xavier sophomore Rachel Hitchens has already been accepted into the University of Rochester medical school. 
- We've been objectified for so many years. We have to prove that we can be more than video dancers. We can actually use our brain, and I think that is, that's the motivating force that's deep down within so many Black women like myself. 
- [Sreenivasan] And like Hitchens, the students we spoke to at this small New Orleans college had big plans. 
- I want to be an orthopedic surgeon. 
- I want to be a pediatric cardiologist. 
- I want to be a rural family practice physician. 
- [Sreenivasan] Paving the way for another generation of African-American doctors. In New Orleans, for the PBS NewsHour, I'm Hari Sreenivasan. 
- Finally tonight, a generous journalism prize was awarded by the Heising Simons Foundation. The American Mosaic Prize is given to two freelance journalists for long-form reporting that highlights underrepresented groups in the American landscape. The two recipients this year are Abe Streep and Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah, whose work also received the Pulitzer Prize last year. Ghansah was featured in our Brief but Spectacular series in 2016, and so we bring that to you again, and we congratulate her and Abe Streep for this honor with encouragement to continue doing meaningful journalism. 
- I like writing about people who look like me and the people I know who don't have good pieces written about them, because we deserve it. I've written about Jimi Hendrix, Electric Lady Studios, Toni Morrison, Kendrick Lamar, the Watts riots, Trayvon Martin, Rachel Jeantel, Dave Chappelle. We don't always hear about the people who we know as legends, the ways that they were very true to themselves. I'm more interested in the moments when they were uncompromising and they were fearless because what I hope is that that fearlessness tells us a little bit about how we can be fearless. What was interesting to me about Dave Chappelle was that here's a moment where typically walking away from Comedy Central, walking away from your career would be a bad decision, and anyone would tell you don't do that. The common understanding of it is is that he felt that the show had started to cross the line and that it was actually becoming a source of embarrassment, and so walking away from $50 million was pretty heroic and pretty decent and full of integrity. Well, you know, I couldn't read until I was 12. Maybe I wasn't 12, but I was older. I think people start reading when they're five or something, and so books were kind of this phantasmagorical space that I couldn't enter because my mom could read, my dad was an academic, everyone was so intelligent, and I couldn't go there, and the moment I could, I just started to read ravenously. One of the books that I remember changing everyone's lives was Beloved. That was the first time people who had been silenced, enslaved people became human, and at that moment I said, this is what a writer can do and so for me, Toni Morrison doesn't exist on a human plane. She almost exists in this odd, spiritual other world in terms of her work, and when she won that Nobel Prize, what was interesting is that a lot of prominent newspapers asked, does this woman deserve it? So when I had the moment to take the New York Times Magazine cover, I decided I'm gonna take that cover to lay flowers at the feet of this woman and say not only did you deserve it, but thank you. My name is Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah, and this is my brief but spectacular take on fearlessness and black art.
