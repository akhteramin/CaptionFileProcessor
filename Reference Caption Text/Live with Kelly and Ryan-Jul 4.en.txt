- [Narrator] Stay ahead of the storms with the StormWatch7 app. 
- [Announcer] It's the Fourth of July. And, Kelly and Ryan are having a party. A pool party. Today, here to splash in the pretend water, the guys from Stranger Things. And, you can't have a celebration without music. So, O.A.R is here, as our holiday house band. And, the co-hosts are tossing bags with the American Cornhole Champions. Plus, members of our studio audience could win some holiday prizes when they compete in our Fourth of July Games. All next, on Live. And now, here are your All-American co-hosts, Kelly Ripa and Ryan Seacrest. 
- Hey! Woo! Looking good! Hi! 
- Hi. 
- Happy Fourth of July. Good morning, everybody. Welcome to our party! 
- Hey, guess what? O.A.R is our house band today, baby. 
- Yeah, yeah. 
- They're going to be performing for us throughout the show, thank you. 
- Kelly, please. 
- Look at this. 
- Let's talk about the Fourth of July, Kelly. 
- Ryan, I was hoping you would bring it up. 
- The most important part of the Fourth, obviously, is not necessarily the history, but posting photographs of your celebration on this day, right? 
- Correct. 
- So many great opportunities. 
- Correct. 
- Now-
- 
- Sophia, you are so cute. Sorry, go ahead. 
- These are the best captions for Fourth of July, for your pictures. So, you're welcome. Put these to good use later. Drinkin', #DrinkinLikeLincoln. Now I'm not making these up. These are actually online. Um... Red, White, and Brew. #RedWhiteAndBrew. The Star Spangled Hammered. Sippin' On LiberTea. 
- Yeah, I like that. 
- Well, that's... If you want. 
- Mhm. You know what? 
- Tell me, Kel. 
- It's funny, 
- Is it? We're talking about, where can we keep this gigantic flamingo? Because, we can all agree, this is probably the greatest pool float in the universe. 
- [Audience Member] Oh, yeah! 
- I think so. 
- Seaworthy. This is like the yacht of sea, of pool floats, Would you not say? 
- This is it. 
- This is what you (stammers) strive for. 
- You guys are rock stars. You have this all day long. This is like, in your tub. But, would you like to see the world's largest pool? It's at a resort in Chile. 
- [Ryan] Look at that, oh my God. 
- [Kelly] It's the San Alfonso Del Mar. World's largest man-made lagoon. It's the exact same crystal-clear, turquoise hue of the sea. 
- Sea Water. 
- So, they made the pool look just like the sea, and they filled it with sea water. I mean, why not just go in the sea, right? I mean, am I right? 
- Well, listen, 
- [Kelly] Am I just... 
- But, listen-
- 
- Am I just being a killjoy? 
- [Ryan] A lot of people are afraid of, I don't know. What they have in the sea. They could have jellyfish. They could have other animals, creatures... 
- Well listen, somebody goes over there, 
- This is safe. 
- Grabs something over there, and pulls a prank, and throws it in the pool. It's gonna live, because it's sea water. 
- It's gonna live 'cause it's sea water. 
- Right? 
- Honey, I'll be right back. I'm going to do some laps. 
- Yeah. How long do you think that would take, days? 
- I guess. I mean, they've got sailboats in there. But, we could definitely get a whole flock of these flamingos. 
- Yeah. We could jet ski in there. 
- Yeah. 
- If that's legal. 
- I see all kinds of things in there. 
- Sometimes, by the way, you know, there are some people who are afraid to swim in the ocean, and so that's a good alternative. On the Fourth of July, we should tell you, I mean, you know this, obviously from history. United States observes a federal holiday, in honor of the Declaration of Independence. Commemorates the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, July 4th, 1776. By delegates from the 13 colonies. Now, now the important stuff. If the Fourth of July falls on a Sunday, we observe the holiday on the following Monday. If it falls on a Saturday, we observe it on a Friday. 
- If it falls on a Thursday-
- 
- If it falls on a Tuesday, we take the whole rest of the week off. 
- Exactly. If it falls in between... 
- Hey, did you hear about this? 
- No, but I'm about to. 
- Do you guys know, how many-
- Let's see, I see a lot of young people here today. Millennials, and Gen Z'ers, 
- Hey guys. 
- Where are you? Yes. Lots. 
- My people. 
- Your people are here. 
- My people. 
- Your people are representing. 
- That's right, I see you. 
- So, the flamingo pose is the latest Instagram friendly stance. Do you know about the flamingo pose, everybody? 
- Oh. 
- Here's, I believe, is that Kendall Jenner? Yep, Kendall Jenner is... Well, are they calling it the flamingo pose because she's wearing that dress? Or, because her legs, the one leg? 
- Well, the dress helps. 
- Gelman, we are, you know, we are in our thong shorts, 
- Yes. 
- So, maybe you can do the flamingo for us? 
- Maybe. 
- Somehow that looks different. That doesn't look like... 
- [Ryan] That was tree, from yoga. 
- (laughs) Well that's all I-
- 
- Yeah. 
- You stand on one leg, and you get bonus points, if you can slightly cross your knees. Which helps to create a slimming effect for your legs. 
- [Ryan] Let's see your bonus points. 
- Gelman, you've got-
- 
- What about my knee? 
- Well, I wouldn't want-
- 
- Come on. What do you want from me? 
- You're actually-
- 
- He actually looks-
- 
- Alright. The other thing that's a trend this summer... (stammers) This is not good for your skin. Can't highly recommend it. But, they're saying sunburn tattoos. You know when you fall asleep in the sun, you leave your hand like this? 
- Yes. 
- Anybody? 
- Yeah. 
- So, sunburn tattoos are big for the Summer of 2019. People are placing stencils on exposed skin. Soaking up the sun. And then, they've got, you know, the Batman logo, or other different things 
- Oh, geeze. 
- That look like a tattoo. 
- [Kelly] Oh, that seems dangerous though. 
- It's, well that's not-
- I mean, and you know it's not, here's the thing kids, and I'm going to tell you this... Oh, gosh. Here's what I'm going to tell you, because nobody told us, in my day, this. Because, there was still like, a lot of conflicting data about sunscreen 
- Mmm, mhm. 
- At least in our household. 
- Right. 
- It's not the sunburn that day, right? It's what the sunburn turns into, 30 years from now. 
- Ah. 
- Right, moms? Yeah. 
- So put it on early so-
- 
- And, I know that it is in your instinct, Sophia, to tune out the moms. Do you understand? I get it. We get it. It's everybody's instinct to tune out the moms, 
- To tune out the moms. Right. 
- But, we actually, (stammers) we actually, when it comes to this thing, know exactly what we're talking about. 
- You carry wisdom with this. 
- Yes, you don't need, you don't need a Batman shaped melanoma, 30 years from now. 
- One other quick public service for the barbecuers today, for July 4th. 
- Yes? 
- If you are someone that-
- When I'm out, and I'm with other people, usually they get the mosquito bites. 
- Am I crowding you? I just noticed you leaned away from me. I feel like... I feel like I just brushed my teeth. So, I don't think it's a-
- 
- No, no, no. You smell like a lozenge. 
- I do. Well, that's because I ate the lozenge. 
- No, but you're not crowding me at all. 
- Right. 
- I just wanted to make eye contact. 
- Oh, okay. So, your vision is going? 
- My vision's bad. Kelly? 
- Kay. 
- Kelly? 
- You're the first millennial I've ever seen do that. 
- Can I borrow my millennial glasses to read this? 
- Sure, go for it. 
- Oh, look at this! No, it's a public service. So, usually I'm not the one gets eaten by mosquitoes. It's the person I'm with. Which is a great going out benefit, but... 
- Oh my gosh. 
- If you're the one that always gets the mosquito bites, researches say, music by Skrillex will prevent the mosquitoes from biting you. Researchers examined the effects of electronic music on mosquitoes, and it made 'em less likely to bite. 
- Yay Skrillex. 
- So, Skrillex is the soundtrack to your barbecue. Today on the show, the cast of Stranger Things, they are here. Gaten, Finn, Caleb, Noah, they're all here, backstage. A whole bunch of 'em. 
- And, nothing says Fourth of July like cornhole. So, we're gonna play cornhole with the top competitors from the American Cornhole League. By the way... I was like, I thought we called it, on our show, live-hole. And, they were like, no, it's only live-hole when we throw the beanbags into our mouths. 
- Into your-
- Exactly. 
- Yes. 
- We've special game that we developed. 
- Unbelievable. 
- This is the real game. 
- This is the real-
- 
- This is the real-
- 
- This is the league? 
- Cornhole. 
- We have the league champions, alright. And, throughout today's show, members of our studio audience will play Live's Fourth of July games. The first game is our annual Fourth of July trivia dancer-off. The dancers dressed themselves up. They're ready to try and dance their way to victory. So, let's dance.

- Okay. 
- So, by the way, happy Fourth of July. 
- Thank you, so much. 
- You look great! 
- Thank you, thank you. 
- Yeah, you look adorable. 
- [Ryan] What is your first statement? 
- My first statement is that every summer, my family and I, we have a friend who's in marketing, and we get a billboard, a vinyl billboard, rip the whole thing down, put it down the hill, in their backyard, and we water-slide down the billboard. 
- Ooh! 
- Oh, that sounds like fun. 
- You steal the billboard from-
- 
- No, he's in marketing. So, they're old billboards. 
- They're old, so it's fine. Okay, and what's your second 
- Yeah. 
- Statement? 
- My second statement is that every Fourth of July, my husband and I are in the town parade, and we're a husband and wife real-estate team. So, I dressed up as the Statue of Liberty, and we have a big American flag, and we throw out candy in the parade. 
- [Ryan] But, he's in marketing, I thought? 
- No, a friend is in marketing. 
- Oh. Well, let's see what the audience thinks on this. 
- I don't know. You've got an honest face. 
- I am honest. 
- You do. Sliding down the vinyl billboard. 
- Huh. 
- So, you put water on it? 
- Yeah, we get a hose and put it at the top-
- 
- Do you use soap? Like a liquid soap? 
- Yep, we get dish soap at the top, and the kids all squirt it down the top. 
- That sounds dangerous. Like, you could really hurt yourselves. 
- That sounds fun. 
- Even on the Slip N Slide. Right? Don't they say adults 
- It's a grass hill. Over the age of 12, and if you weigh more than blah, blah, blah. 
- [Holly] It's a grass hill. 
- It's a grass hill? I like that story. 
- Okay. 
- What do you think? 
- I think that that's... Okay, I'm gonna... I don't wanna... It's the Fourth of July. So, for the sake of harmony, 
- Yeah? 
- I'm gonna go with you. But, in the back of my mind, I want it noted, that I actually believe that is B.S.. Okay? 
- In the name of harmony, is it true that you slide down the billboard? 
- Am I supposed to tell you right now? 
- Yes, right now. 
- Yes, it's true. 
- Yay! 
- Happy holiday. 
- Wow. 
- Thank you, audience. Thank you.

- You can't get under her skin, but I know what can wind Kelly up. 
- Like what? What's one thing that can wind me up? 
- Serving you garlic. 
- Oh, that is true. 
- Oh, yeah.

- Very sensitive to garlic. 
- Oh.

- Caleb's always blowing his nose. All the time. 
- Oh, really? 
- Yeah. 
- Yes. 
- Every day of his life. 
- You know why? I have PTSD as a child. 
- Okay. 
- I look at old pictures of my young self, and there's a lot of boogers. So, I... I also... 
- Yeah. 
- I suffer from that, and I'm like, I make sure there is no boogers in my nose. 
- Wait, do you-
- 
- So... 
- Caleb, do you have like, boogers-
- 
- So, every time I feel something, I'm like-
- 
- Older siblings? 
- Yeah, I do. But, they won't tell me. 
- They didn't tell you. 
- Nah. 
- That's right, yeah. 
- You should have people on the set that tell you whether you have boogers-
- 
- Oh, they do. 
- They do. 
- But, I just, when I feel something, I'm like, can I get a tissue? 
- Yeah, it's not there. 
- There is also-
- 
- Kelly loves a snot rocket. She just (whistles), fires it right out. 
- Well, it comes to the point where it's like, we're doing a really serious scene, and Caleb's off camera, 
- Oh, yeah. 
- And I'm like doing, and I'm doing the scene, I look at Caleb, and he's like-
- As quietly as he can. 
- Every picture of myself as a three-year-old child, it's just shiny boogers. 
- Oh, that's with every kid. 
- Delicious. 
- We've been doing scenes... 
- Delicious. 
- We've been doing scenes, and like, the camera will be on one of us, and like, he'll be behind the camera, reading for us, and he'll just be blowing his nose during the middle of the shot. I'm like dude, really? 
- Yeah. 
- And then, it makes me laugh so much. Like, when the cameras-
- 
- It makes me laugh so much. 
- Well, what does Gaten do? Finn, what does Gaten do? 
- Uh... 
- He's perfect. He's from New Jersey. 
- A lot. 
- Gaten... 
- Gaten does like-
- 
- Yeah, Gaten does a lot. 
- Gaten just dances (mumbles). 
- He dances, and sings a lot. 
- He's always (mumbles). 
- Well, 'cause he's happy. He's from New Jersey. 
- I'm happy. 
- That's great. 
- Jersey's not happy. 
- Jersey-
- 
- Yes, yes. 
- [Noah] Are all people from New Jersey happy? 
- Yes, we're all happy. 
- No (laughs). 
- We are, listen, we are happy. And, if you question us, 
- We're happier, 
- We will fight you about it. 
- And we're nicer. 
- That's how happy we are. 
- Yeah, that's right. That's right. 
- We are intense. 
- We will beat you up, 
- We will fight you about it. 
- Over how happy we are. 
- Now, who has their driver's license among you? 
- Oh. 
- I have my permit. 
- No on has it. 
- Good question. 
- I have my permit. 
- You're permitted? 
- Yeah, I get my license in September. 
- Oh, you do? 
- Are you excited? 
- Yeah, I am excited. 
- And, I get my license when I turn 18. 
- When you turn 18? 
- Yeah, this year, this year. 
- Yeah, okay. 
- I'm 14 years (mumbles). 
- You're 14! 
- But, I can get my (mumbles). 
- Go-karts. I got a... I went in for the first learners-permit test, really excited, and I got (stammers), I didn't get every question wrong, but... (stammers) It's why I chose acting over academics, and... And, I got one question wrong. It was like the passing thing, (stammers) I like, just like, held my head low, and like, I got up, and my mom was like, Did you pass? And, I was just like, Let's go. 
- You know what? 
- Listen-
- 
- We'll be fine. 
- Get chauffeurs. You're on a hit show 
- Yeah. 
- For God sakes. 
- I wanna drive. 
- Is everyone a chauffeur, in the audience? We got a chauffeur's audience. 
- Yeah. Well, we-
- 
- Now that I'm finally driving, I don't like being a passenger. At all. 
- Oh. 
- 'Cause, you wanna be in control? 
- I do. 
- Backseat driver. 
- It's weird. I'm not a backseat driver. I try not to be. It was funny, my uncle, my mom's twin brother, told her, when she first started driving, 'cause he got his license first, that if there was a white line around a stop sign, it was optional. 
- What? 
- That's really funny. 
- And, for those of you who don't know, I'm sure most of you do, 
- That's very funny. 
- Most stop signs have a white line around them. And, it took her like, three months to realize that was not true. 
- So, how many stop signs did she run? 
- No one was hurt. No one was hurt. Everyone was fine. 
- Nobody was hurt. I love that. 
- So, you guys are on this massively popular show, Stranger Things. 
- I'm like, falling. 
- That's alright, there's a hole there. 
- I know. There's a hole we designed. 
- We created. 
- Yeah. Just lean back, and relax. Yeah, come on. 
- Is it difficult to keep the secrets of the show? 
- Is it difficult to keep-
- 
- Because, people are always wanting to know what's coming up, what's happening, right? 
- I feel like, nowadays, because we're in season three, in the beginning it wasn't so hard, because nothing was out. But now, I forget which season I'm talking about. 
- Yeah, same. 
- And then, I might spoil something. 
- Right. 
- Or, say something about the season that's coming out. But, no one catches it. 
- In season one, we told everybody like, the entire plot line. 
- Yeah. 
- Was spoiling everything. 
- Well, we were like, okay, so like, 
- Yeah (laughs). 
- (stammers) There's this girl named Eleven, and then at the end, she disappears.

- My body is truly powerful. 
- I have the power to lower my blood-sugar and A1C. 
- I guess I can still make my own insulin, and Trulicity activates my body, to release it like it's supposed to. 
- [Narrator] Trulicity is for people with type 2 diabetes. It's not insulin. 
- [Man] I take it once a week. It starts acting in my body from the first dose. 
- [Narrator] Trulicity isn't for people with type 1 diabetes, or diabetic ketoacidosis. Don't take Trulicity if you're allergic to it, you or your family have medullary thyroid cancer, or have multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2. Stop Trulicity and call your doctor right away if you have an allergic reaction, a lump or swelling in your neck, or severe stomach pain. Serious side effects may include pancreatitis. Taking Trulicity with a sulfonylurea, or insulin, increases low-blood-sugar risk. Side effects include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, belly pain, and decreased appetite, which lead to dehydration, and may worsen kidney problems. 
- I have it within me to lower my A1C. 
- [Narrator] Ask your doctor about Trulicity. 
- How would I describe overpaying on a used car? It's humiliating! And, It's expensive! I just trusted the wrong used car sites.

- But, I guess life goes on. So, aright, come on, boy. Here we go. Let's go, buddy.

- [Narrator] Do you have trouble falling asleep? Do you toss or turn all night, or wake up with a sore neck, or a headache? Then it's time you discovered MyPillow. 
- Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, inventor of MyPillow. Just like you, I had problems sleeping. I tried every pillow out there, and nothing worked. 15 years ago, I invented MyPillow. It took me two years to develop, because I wanted to have everything you would ever want in a pillow. I made sure that you could adjust my patented fill, so you could have the exact support you need as an individual. Regardless of your sleep position. I also wanted a pillow that would last. So, I made MyPillow machine washable, and dryable. I back MyPillow with a 10 year warranty, and a 60 day money-back guarantee. Not only that, I do all my own manufacturing, in my home state of Minnesota. Take advantage of my 2-pack special. Use the promo code, and get two MyPillow's for $69.98. That's only $34.99 a pillow. Call, or go online now. 
- [Narrator] Other pillows go flat. Causing you to fold them over, or use your arm for support. Which can cause pain. Hard foam pillows can raise your head too high, and heat up during the night. Making you very uncomfortable. But, the revolutionary MyPillow has patented fill that won't go flat, and helps keep your neck supported, and aligned, to your exact individual need. MyPillow helps you get, and stay in deep sleep, all night long. 
- Before MyPillow, sleeping was a nightmare. First night I got it, slept like a baby. Just was out, completely out. 
- I sleep better. I wake up, I feel refreshed, I feel healthy. 
- MyPillow helps me get a good nights sleep, so I can do my job in the morning. 
- I personally guarantee that MyPillow will be the most comfortable pillow you'll ever own. And, I wanna thank each and every one of you, for your support. 
- [Narrator] Call, or go to mypillow.com, to take advantage of Mike's 2-pack special. Use the promo code, and Mike will send you two MyPillow premiums, for just $69.98. That's only $34.99 a pillow. This offer is not available in stores. So, don't delay. Call, or go online now. [Music] For the best night's sleep [Music] [Music] In the whole-wide world [Music] [Music] Visit MyPillow.com [Music]
