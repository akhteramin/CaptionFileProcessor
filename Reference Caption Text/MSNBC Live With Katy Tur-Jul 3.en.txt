- None of us knew what that swoosh was until they invented it. 
- Of marketing, yeah! And signing Kaepernick you know, in those moments where there was a lot criticism which they knew they were going to get, the burning of the shoes and the rest of it. In those immediate moments after that, they did actually see their stock price go up 
- [Man] Yeah. and their shoes sales go up. 
- It'll be interesting to see what happens now and whether their reaction to this controversy was the right step.

Kasie Hunt picks up our coverage right now. Hello, friend! 
- Hello to you as well, Ali. And we will see you of course in just an hour. Good afternoon, I am Kasie Hunt in for Katy Tur. It's 11:00 a.m. out west and 2:00 p.m. here in Washington, where the President's own Department of Homeland Security has issued a scathing report on the squalid conditions found in a number of migrant detention centers along the border. The report from the DHS's Office of the Inspector General describes dangerous levels of overcrowding for long periods of time. In one facility, some adults were kept in standing room only conditions for a week. While at another, many migrants spent more than a month in small cells packed dangerously over capacity. Most of the adults have not had a shower, despite some of them being held for as long as a month. Some facilities provided wet wipes to maintain hygiene. One man, locked in a crowded cells, held up a crudely-made sign for inspectors, begging for help. Meanwhile, many children were held without care for basic standards of living, including access to showers and clean clothes. At two of the five facilities visited by the Inspector General, children were not given hot meals until the inspectors arrived. But according to the President and his allies, there's nothing to see here. Just ask acting DHS head Kevin McAleenan, who defended the conditions at one notorious Texas detention center late last week. 
- Unsubstantiated allegations last week regarding a single border control facility in Clint Station in Texas created a sensation, that's balanced somewhat since several media outlets toured the Clint Station and saw the actual conditions there. A clean and well-managed facility and well-equipped process, but frankly much of the coverage is simply too late and is missing the story. 
- So, our big question today is: will the White House accept accountability for its immigration policies? Joining me now NBC News correspondent Jacob Soboroff, former Republican Congressman and MSNBC political analyst Carlos Curbelo, and former California Senator Barbara Boxer, she now hosts the Boxer podcast. Jacob, let me start with you. This report from the OIG, I'm just gonna read a little bit more from it. Senior managers at several facilities raised security concerns for their agents and the detainees. For example, one called the situation a ticking time bomb. It really underscores the fact that they seem to have understood just how bad things had gotten and just how much of a problem this was gonna be and yet, nothing seems to be done. 
- Yeah, you hit the nail on the head, Kasie. And I think the ticking time bomb very clearly references and is an accurate description of these seven facilities in the Rio Gran valley, but not only there. It can be applied to the facilities that Julia Ainsley and I reported on earlier this week in the Al Paso sector. And frankly, that phrase, a ticking time bomb can be ascribed to the border patrol detention system that has existed in this country for decades. It has never been worse than it is right now during the Trump Administration, seeing more families come here than ever before, particularly because of the aggressive metering policies and the remain in Mexico policies that are forcing people to cross illegally because they don't want to wait in one of the most dangerous countries in the world, Mexico. But for years we have known that those detention facilities are designed for single adult men and as you have people that are coming to claim asylum, unaccompanied minors, we saw this during the Obama Administration in 2014, and now families during the Trump Administration, those facilities are not suitable for the people that we are seeing cross our border, largely asylum seekers. So you could call them a ticking time bomb over the course of the last year, but frankly they've been a ticking time bomb for decades, Kasie. 
- Jacob, the White House must have had advanced notice of this report, no? 
- You know, I don't know that the White House specifically, I have no reporting that the White House had knowledge of what was going on in these facilities and what the Office of Inspector General in the Department of Homeland Security was finding. But they certainly have had access to conversations with members of the Department of Homeland Security. They've known about, and I'm sure the President is getting reports on who is crossing the border, where these folks are being detained, ultimately where they want to go and why they come to this country. So the idea that maybe this is a surprise to the White House doesn't square with the information that's available to them from their own Department of Homeland Security. I know that they are very, very plugged in to what's going on on a daily basis down there on the border. 
- Yeah, Congressman Curbelo, you had visited and been, or tried to visit, I should say, visit a detention facility and were denied access when you were a member of Congress. And you are Republican, albeit one who has advocated at times for an immigration policy that is different than what this administration has obviously pushed. What is your view on what the administration needs to be doing right now to help the people who are in these detention centers? 
- Well Kasie, first let me say that this would be a difficult situation for any administration. On any given day, three, four, five thousand people are coming across the border. This is a new kind of immigration, not the kind that we used to see 10, 15 years ago. A lot of families, a lot of young children. This is a difficult challenge and I think we have to be fair and have to recognize that. The other thing I'll say is that there's a major difference between the detention facilities near the border and those in other parts of the country. Down here in South Florida there are a few of them dedicated specifically to minors and the conditions there are a lot better than what we see out of those images coming from the border. But the fact remains that the administration has to do better and that they would just brush off this report from the IG at the Department of Homeland Security is unacceptable. Congress has to do more to dedicate more funding to update these facilities to make sure that they're compatible with the kind of immigration we're seeing coming into our country. And of course, the laws do have to be changed because unfortunately the way our laws are designed, they do invite people to come over with children specifically because the Coyotes advertise that as a more advantageous strategy for trying to come to the United States. So this is a complex, complicated problem and unfortunately I don't think this White House is taking it as seriously as they should. 
- Senator Boxer, there is though, I mean I take the Congressman's point, but there are still a lot of decisions that any administration can make about how they are going to prioritize the enforcements of our laws based on the records of the people that are crossing our borders. What could the Trump Administration be doing differently today to try to make this better? 
- Listen, I'm gonna talk in very stark terms here. What we see is not a ticking time bomb. The bomb has gone off for seven children who died, for these little babies that have blue fingers because they're freezing, these parents who were told, reportedly, drink out of the toilet because there's no fresh water. This is not you have to do better time, this is we're not going to have this done in our name time. And we have to fix it. It's a stain on America, it's being done in our name. So, what do we do? The first thing is we bring back the model project that Barack Obama had in place that worked very well as an alternative to detention where 98% of the people showed up for their court date. Secondly, we need a surge of case workers. Beto O'rourke has suggested this. Case workers for these various cases they can be followed so they follow the rules, and they are taken care of. And we know that this deterance is a strategy of Trump and how does he think he's gonna deter people? By making them go through agony. This is not America! It needs to stop. Period. 
- Jacob Soboroff, jump in. 
- Yeah, so respectively to both the Senator and the Congressman, both of you served when these facilities were already in place. In 2014, President Obama had a surge of unaccompanied migrant children in facilities just like this and we saw pictures just like this. And so these conditions are not new, so I do agree with you, Senator Boxer, that President Trump has made this worse than ever before, and Congressman Curbelo, I have been to that homestead facility in South Florida, I was just there last week during the debates where 2,300 migrant children are currently living in the custody of HHS, and yes, certainly, the facilities there are better, and there are licensed social care workers to take care of the children. But the idea that we didn't have any warning of this, that the ticking time bomb is just limited to this time period now, I don't think it's fair. I mean I think that the idea that the immigration detention system has largely been based on deterrence since the Clinton Administration, there was an official document that the border patrol put out called, Prevention through Deterrence, they've known that deterrence-based model from the Clinton Administration into the Bush Administration, into the Obama Administration, and now with the Trump Administration worse than ever before, was always forcing people to take more dangerous and deadly routes into this country. And that the conditions that they were housed in once they were in detention were never meant to be for people to stay over 72 hours, and we have seen stuff like this before, it's just not as bad as it is today. 
- Could I respond to that 
- [Kasie] Senator Boxer, yeah please, I mean, 
- since I was mentioned? 
- The reality here is that the Obama Administration's record on immigration has in fact been criticized, partly for the reasons that Jacob outlines. Your response. 
- It's all fine, it's all fine. The bottom line is, we can look back to that days where there were these issues, but I would argue there was nothing, nothing to this extent. This is now deterrence by agony. That's what we have. It's just unreal, and I voted for comprehensive immigration reform, had Paul Ryan allowed that to go to a vote, we wouldn't have any of this now. So we can argue about what happened in 2014, I'm up for that. I'm not absolving anybody. What I'm saying is, this is happening now. Let's fix it now. 
- [Kasie] Right. 
- Let's search the judges, let's search the case workers, let's go back to Obama's plan which was an alternative to detention that Jake didn't mention that was working really well. Let's try it, I don't care, I'm not saying everyone has been wonderful on this, I'm not saying I've been wonderful on this, it's happening now. And I'll tell you something. I wouldn't be surprised if there's some kind of complaint to the World Court about this, that there are crimes 
- Kasie. 
- against humanity going on in our name, in our name. 
- [Kasie] Congressman jump in. 
- Let me just say briefly, the administration deserves a lot of the criticism it receives and certainly on immigration. I was an outspoken critic when I was at Congress of this administration, but I will say, we need a little sobriety here. We need to take note of the fact that this is an extraordinary set of circumstances. I remember in 1994 when over 30,000 Cubans attempted to come across the Florida straits, the Clinton Administration set up tent cities in Guantanamo Bay, at Gitmo. We are seeing a flood of immigrants, of migrants coming across the border that is extraordinary and that doesn't mean it's acceptable for the conditions that have been reported out of these facilities to be present, that all has to change. But again, this is not a regular time when it comes to illegal immigration into our country and we just simply have to take that into account in evaluating what's happening at the border. 
- But don't you think, Congressman, I mean I do take your point that this is an extraordinary circumstance but I mean these people are suffering as the Senator said, in our name right now. 
- And that's totally unacceptable and what we need is for Congress to fund new facilities that are compatible, the type of immigration we're getting into our country. It's not men crossing the border looking for work anymore, it's families, it's children, and these facilities aren't designed to hold them. And we need facilities that can hold these families while their cases are adjudicated, while they're being processed. Clearly, we don't have that in place today and that has to change. 
- Sorry, Kasie, can I just quickly jump in? 
- Very quickly, Jacob, last word we gotta go to break. 
- Sure, just what the Congressman is suggesting here, and correct me if I'm wrong, Congressman, is what the Trump Administration is suggesting and what the Obama Administration also wanted to do, which was to turn around unaccompanied, undocumented migrant children from Central America and deport them immediately when they get here, and or detain families indefinitely, indefinite detention of migrant families, instead of releasing them into the interior. I think it's a very controversial policy, and when you say we need to change the laws, I think we need to go a little deeper on what changing those laws actually means and what that means for the migrants 
- Well, Jacob. that we're saying right now that we want to help. 
- Real quick, it doesn't have to be that way. We can prioritize cases where minors are involved so that they can be processed immediately, not so that they're held for months and months but maybe two, three weeks until those cases are adjudicated. 
- This is obviously 
- And can I just say. an incredibly, I'm sorry Senator we're gonna have to, 
- Can I just jump in here too. This is clearly 
- Well, why don't we 
- very emotional. 
- help those countries? 
- This is a very emotional 
- No, it is. debate and that is absolutely a policy that we also have discussed on this program and will in the future. Jacob Soboroff, Carlos Curbelo and Barbara Boxer, thank you all very much.

- The Trump Administration is reportedly sweating bullets over what some are describing as a meltdown at the National Rifle Association. Politico reporting today quote: The turmoil is fueling fears that the organization will be profoundly diminished heading into the election, leaving the Republic Party with a gaping hole in its political machinery. The President called the NRA a quote, victim of harassment in a tweet this week saying that the gun rights group that helped get him to the White House might move to Texas, where they are loved. He suggested the NRA can get better protection there from the New York state investigation into the group's tax exempt status. But the attention from the President comes amid multiple other reports around the fracture at the NRA including an ugly dispute over leadership of the organization. Joining me now, Politico political reporter Alex Isenstadt and Daily Beast politics reporter and MSNBC contributor Betsy Woodruff. Thank you both for being here. Alex, this was your story in Politico about just how concerned the President's campaign is about, frankly it seems like a total collapse at the NRA or at least an inability to look outward at this point. What does it mean potentially for the President's reelect? 
- It's hard to overstate just how important the NRA is to the Republican Party turn-out apparatus in elections. The NRA has over 5 million members and the dues-paying members they do have, for them the NRA is a very important, it's a very important organization and so they can really turn out voters and they can turn out voters for the Republican side. And so without them on the field, that could have big implications for the GOP come 2020. 
- Betsy, you've done a lot of reporting on kind of how the bottom has fallen out of the NRA and kind of how they've all turned on each other. What is your assessment rooted in that reporting, of how effective the NRA is going to be capable of being in 2020? 
- The biggest question is just money. Is the NRA going to be able to replicate the massive expenditures that it made on Trump's race in 2016. Remember, in 2016 it was fairly controversial within the NRA as to whether to spend as much money as they did on Trump. There were some voices according to my sources who said this Trump guy doesn't look like he's gonna go very far, maybe we should focus on Congress, making sure the potential President Clinton wouldn't have majorities in the House and Senate. But several important leadership figures in the NRA including, according to people I've spoken to, Chris Cox argued no, we need to go all in and we need to spend big on Trump. Chris Cox, who used to be the top lobbyist at the NRA just officially left the association within the last few days. How that leadership void is going to be filled is really important. And of course the huge question is just, are the NRA's financial problems gonna limit how big of a war chest they have to spend on Trump? Oliver North, who was formerly president of the NRA deposed and what some described as a coo, wrote in a document that I obtained that the NRA's outside counsel had billed at upwards of 24 million dollars over about a year just for legal services. Now that number is disputed by some, but if they're spending on legal bills at that scale, that's a lot of money for a non-profit and it's money they can't spend in 2020. 
- And Betsy is this, how much of this has trickled down to the NRA's members that Alex was talking about? I mean are people starting who normally give money, show up, do what the NRA asks them to do, are they starting to get nervous? 
- Look, it's hard to say exactly how far it's trickled out. And remember among the NRA's core membership there's a lot of skepticism of the mainstream media. They view a lot of the reporters who cover these issues as fundamentally hostile to the things that they care about. So as far as an audience, in terms of the way they relate to news reports, it's more skeptical. That said, at the same time, of course it is affecting the membership, it's frustrating board members, Allen West who's sort of a conservative fan favorite is a member of the NRA board and has called for Wayne LaPierre to be deposed. And frankly, if you just look at the debates that are going on, on NRA board member's Facebook pages and in the YouTube comments of gun YouTube pages, you'll see a ton of friction and a ton of criticism particularly of NRA's CEO Wayne LaPierre. 
- And Alex, you also write in your story that this goes, the concern about this goes beyond the President, that some Republicans are calling on the NRA to address its 2020 plans and that within the past week, senators have privately expressed concerns about the group to NRSC Chairman Todd Young. I mean this could really affect the Senate playing field, too. 
- Absolutely, Senate, the Republicans are trying to protect their Senate majority in 2020 and a lot of these Senators who were elected first in 2014, they won with the help of the National Rifle Association. And so you can be that it's not just going to be the Trump campaign that's gonna be counting on the NRA to turn out voters in critical states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, those really important Rust Belt. It's also gonna be Senators who are up for reelection in 2020 and so you're likely to hear a lot more from them in the weeks to come on this. 
- [Kasie] Alright, a lot at stake here. Alex Isenstadt, Betsy Woodruff, thank you guys both very much, it's great to see you. With her polling on the rise, can Kamala Harris create a winning coalition like former President Obama's?

- After a stand-out debate performance, Senator Kamala Harris will campaign in Iowa today. It's a place where support for the California candidate appears to be surging, according to several post-debate polls. A new USA Today Suffolk University poll puts Harris in second place with 16% in the early caucus state. The Senator's rise has some wondering whether she can follow in President Obama's footsteps. As NBC's Alex Seitz-Wald puts it, quote, The question turns to the notion of electability
- an obsession for many Democratic primary voters
- on its head, and would have been inconceivable just a week ago. Like Obama, Harris hails from her party's establishment, but is a relatively fresh face with only two years under her belt in the Senate. And she has some progressive positions that could also make her appealing to younger, more liberal voters. Joining me now from Iowa, NBC News political reporter Vaughn Hillyard, reporter for NBCnews.com Alex Seitz-Wald, and PBS News Hour Washington correspondent and an MSNBC political contributor, Yamiche Alcindor. Vaughn, let me start with you on the ground. Obviously these polls have been good for Senator Harris, but I'm curious what you're picking up behind the scenes with the campaign. I mean clearly many of her staffers have been pretty giddy about that performance and it is starting to show up in the numbers, but at the same time, they've made a risky strategy bet here, and there are also questions if she is gonna go all in in Iowa, this poll would suggest perhaps she can. What are you picking up on? 
- Exactly, this is a campaign that looked at their polling sitting at about 6, 7, 8%. Ever since her launch back in January, and the campaign always looked at this as the debate being the opportunity to introduce herself, as Alex pointed out in his piece there, she's just in her third year in the United States Senate out of California. The debate was an opportunity to speak before 20 million people and essentially introduce herself. And what this campaign has felt compelled to make the case on, from going from the likes of Michigan, down into Louisiana, through this primary process, is that Kamala Harris is a general election candidate. Well, Barack Obama won, we should know, back in 2008, won the Iowa caucus over the likes of John Edwards and Hillary Clinton. He also won the state of Iowa over not only John McCain in 2008 but also Mitt Romney in 2012. That was the state of Iowa. And they make the case, if Kamala Harris can go into places like here in Iowa but also up in Michigan and drive higher turn-out in places like the Detroit area, or around the parts of Milwaukee, essentially when you're talking about electability, Kamala Harris is your candidate and that's the case that now she's trying to make here over the course of these next three days in Iowans, into Iowans. 
- Yamiche Alcindor what have you seen on this question of Iowa and, it's true that Barack Obama was an African American who appealed to a largely white electorate in Iowa and it's what set him on the path to the Presidency, and the coalition that we're starting to see behind some of this polling is white liberals and increasingly African Americans. Is this a trajectory that can hold? 
- It's a trajectory that can hold for now if she can weather the storm of what will now be an intense look at her background, an intense vetting of her stances on all sorts of things as a prosecutor. I think, I've talked to some Democratic consultants who say there's gonna be a number of front runners going forward so right now Joe Biden was seen as the person that was really leading the pack, now after this debate, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren I should also say, are on the rise. But I think what we're really gonna have to look at is whether or not after people learn more about Senator Harris' background including all her criminal justice issues, but also her stances on all sorts of things including immigration and health care, where she differs in some ways from other candidates. Thinking about the fact that she said that she would not leave private insurance or eliminate private insurance for government-run insurance. So I think once people really start digging into her, we'll really have to see whether or not she can hold that coalition together. But of course, people are very excited about her. I think her debate performance really made a lot of people think she could go after Donald Trump, be on stage with him, look him in the eye and really go toe-to-toe with him. 
- So Alex, one critical piece here obviously is African American voters. And that has been the most important, if I would say piece to Joe Biden's support so far. And you write, Support for Biden among blacks, a critical Democratic voting bloc, was cut in half. You're talking about one of these, oh, excuse me this is a Reuter's poll, not your story, my apologies. But they're writing with two out of 10 saying they backed Obama's former vice president, compared with four out of 10 in the June poll for Biden. So I mean Harris does seem to be making real in-roads here. What's going to cement this coalition, if anything? 
- Right, well this is the promise of the Kamala Harris candidacy from the very beginning that a candidate with her background could unite white liberals, Whole Foods liberals in one hand, and of course African Americans. 
- [Kasie] Whole Foods liberals, yes. 
- Given her background, those two groups together, the Whole Foods liberals and African Americans, that's a pretty unstoppable coalition in a Democratic primary. Of course that didn't happen until the debate. But there's now been about four or five polls that have come after the debate including the Reuter's poll, there's a Quinnipiac poll yesterday that showed her climbing among African Americans and Biden falling. And as you said, that has been his biggest source of strength, it was Hillary Clinton's biggest source of strength in 2016. I think the field is probably too big for any one candidate to consolidate African Americans. Cory Booker is obviously still in this race. But if she can solidify a big chunk of them, that can create a base for her in the long run. And she has a huge amount of room to grow. She can appeal to African Americans, she can appeal to white liberals, she's also Indian American and she's a woman. Women did very well in 2018. Democrats are very excited about the idea of voting for women right now. The question is, is she too little to everyone and kinda fall in the middle, which is I think where she has been heading into the debate, or can she now use the strength of the debate stage to press forward and solidify that count. 
- Let me flip that last point you made about women voter's on its head because I'm curious how much you're picking up on this. Lisa Lara over at the New York Times wrote today about the thinking that a woman is not the right nominee in 2016 because a woman, or in 2020, because a woman lost to Donald Trump in 2016. And there was a South Carolina voter quoted in her story, who supports Harris, but this woman who says she is an African American woman says quote, I don't think she can win. And I'm sorry to have to say that. She is a woman and she is black. As a black woman myself, I think that as much as we would like to believe there's been this huge shift in this country, we have seen the reality that people will fight back against change. How much has this sentiment under the radar that it often is, contributed to Harris' struggle to rise? Clearly she's broken out since, but she was kinda floating back there for a while. Is this why? 
- I think this is a huge problem for her and Elizabeth Warren. Electability is the number one thing that Democrats say they care about this year. The very first voter that I talked to in Iowa of this entire year, January 6th at an Elizabeth Warren event, said, I love Elizabeth Warren, but I don't think the country is ready for a woman. It was a middle-aged woman who told me that. So this is a very real phenomenon. The data, on the other hand, show that this absolutely not true, that women when they're on the ballot win just as often as men do, that there is no punishment for electability, and that the under representation of women in politics is more about barriers entry for candidates getting on the ballots more than voters discriminating against them when they're voting. So I think the electorate is starting to realize that, but it's going to take some time to combat the perception that they're not electable. 
- Of course the question 
- [Yamiche] I also think Barack Obama. 
- is what is the difference between, the difference of course between the data that you're talking about and what actually is playing out on the ground is something that we've never had it tested at the Presidential level. 
- [Alex] True. 
- And I'm sorry Yamiche, go ahead. 
- Well I'll also just say that when Barack Obama was running there were so many African Americans that told me personally, I'm not sure that this country's ready for it, but then when he won Iowa, and he started really showing off in the debates and people really started listening to his message and became really inspired by his campaign, people put all that aside and said We're gonna go behind this African American man. So I think same thing with Senator Harris, I think her debate performance made people think she might be capable of doing this and start really helping people understand that there can be an African American woman. So I think, and when we saw progress last time it was an African American man pushing the boundaries and we can say that again. I think if we see that, it will be Elizabeth Warren or Tulsi Gabbard, or other women possibly pushing the cards to say, look we can do this and we can inspire a nation, if they are to be successful. 
- Alright, Yamiche Alcindor, Alex Sietz-Wald, Vaugh Hillyard, thank you guys all very much. So with Biden in the lead and Harris surging in these polls, what about the rest of the field? We're gonna check in with NBC's road warriors who are with Senators Sanders and Warren, coming up next.

- Vice President Joe Biden is still atop every poll out there, and yes, caveat, it is early. But according to three major polls out since the debates, a field of four: Biden, Harris, Warren and Sanders seem to be separating from the pack. And when Quinnipiac asked specifically about which candidate had the best policy ideas, two of those contenders came out as clear-cut favorites: Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Covering their campaigns and joining me now, NBC News political reporters Shaquille Brewster and Ali Vitali and here with me in Washington, Reuter's political correspondent, Ginger Gibson. Shaq, let me start with you because Sander's support has been slipping in these recent national polls and I've seen some flashes of frustration from Sanders in that he feels and will tell anyone, well, told me in a recent interview, he's the person, he's the reason why we're talking about so many of these policy issues, Medicare for all, et cetera, how is the campaign trying to get their footing back underneath them? 
- You hit that point, Kasie, there are so many more options for voters in this election with so many candidates there. And that's why you have Senator Sanders trying to really focus on contacting as many voters as they can. He's in the middle of this three day swing through the state of Iowa. And what's different about this swing is what he's highlighting in this trip. And I can tell you he's not highlighting those recent polls and I spoke to his chief of staff just about an hour ago and for every poll I was able to mention where Sanders was apparently losing support or losing ground or ticking down in the polls, he was able to throw back polls that showed him either gaining support or stagnant. So that's why Sanders is here, he's focused on retail politics. He's having ice cream socials, he's gonna be marching in several, I believe it's five Independence Day parades over the course of this trip. He's trying to connect with as many voters as he can and then he's also focused on his ground game. He just opened up an office here in Iowa City, he's gonna be opening up two more on this trip, trying to galvanize his supporters and bring in as many volunteers as he can. He wants to show that he still has that momentum that he had in 2016 through his supporters. 
- Well that organization I will absolutely buy but I do not recognize the ice cream social candidate Bernie Sanders compared to the large rally version of him in 2016. Ali Vitali. 
- And selfies. 
- Right? Unbelievable. Ali, you have been covering Elizabeth Warren. She also seems to be having something of a moment. What's the sense in her campaign about where her support is coming from, is it coming from Bernie's supporters, is it coming from elsewhere, and how do they make sure that they continue that slow, steady build that they've been working on? 
- Well you say slow and steady and that really has been the mantra over here. When you talk to folks on the campaign, they've really long-held this theory that the polls will rise and fall, but that to them the ultimate thing that you can't get back in a campaign is time. That's why Elizabeth Warren was one of the earliest people in this race to launch her campaign. She's been getting folks out on the ground. I know we haven't seen her quarter two numbers yet, but last quarter we saw that her burn rate was so high because they're investing so heavily in ground game. And in a place like Nevada where we were last night and where she's gonna be in Reno tonight, she's really seeing some of that pay off, potentially at the expense of Bernie Sanders because as Shaq and I have seeing over the course of the past several months, voters who like her on policy recognize that there might be a policy twin in Bernie Sanders, but they're not buying him as the messenger necessarily. Listen to what one voter told me last night. 
- Bernie is not on my list this time around, I think we all heard his plans last time and it didn't get him the nomination. I think we're ready for someone new. And when I watch the debates, Bernie to me personally he came across as kind of angry and in your face and that's not what we need right now. I'm done with in your face. 
- This is the reality of the new landscape for Bernie Sanders. Last time around, it was him versus Hillary Clinton. This time around, it's him and his ideas as the central focus, but maybe a lot of other messengers who can pick up where Bernie Sanders left off, Kasie. 
- Yeah, that's a good point. Interesting, interesting comments from that voter that you found there, Ali. Ginger Gibson, the Sanders campaign insists that they're gonna try to, they're gonna keep their base, they're gonna try to reach out to disillusioned voters, perhaps even people who voted for Trump to try to get ahead in this primary, but the reality is, he seems to be basically, if not falling, then right where he was and in a crowded field like this, that's a tough spot to be. 
- I think the biggest debate inside Washington when it comes to Bernie Sanders right now is where is his floor. People have suggested that he might already be there, that this is his strident supporters backing him and he hasn't grown beyond that, that he's really sort of capped out at that bottom level but he hasn't appeared to evolve or to grow his base in a way that would bring more people in, particularly when there are more people on the stage with him of which to choose from. The party has changed a lot in the last four years. The voters have changed a lot in the last four years, and largely Bernie Sanders has stayed the same. And they will tell you, oh he's got new proposals, he's evolved, he's changed so much, but really, the Bernie Sanders we saw on that 2016 stage is the same Bernie Sanders we saw last week. 
- [Kasie] Right, and he was hesitant then to talk about, he'll talk about economic justice but he won't necessarily talk about social justice through a racial lens, which of course is what a lot of these voters are looking for this time around. Ginger Gibson, Shaq Brewster, Ali Vitali, thank you guys very much. The stage is set and the tanks have taken to the mall. But concern over the President's Fourth of July salute to America is only growing across D.C. The reasons why, coming up next.

- Tomorrow's the big day. President Trump's controversial salute to America. Some Bradley fighting vehicles which were spotted heading towards the mall, but they are not the only things on the move. According to The Washington Post, the National Park Service is diverting nearly $2.5 million in entrance and recreation fees that were primarily intended to improve parks across the country. Just a fraction of the extra costs the government faces as a result of this event. President promising a show of a lifetime, defended his production on Twitter saying quote, The cost of our great Salute to America tomorrow will be very little compared to what it is worth. We own the planes, we have the pilots, the airport is right next door, all we need is the fuel. We own the tanks and all. Fireworks are donated by two of the greats. Nice! Joining me now from the national mall in Washington, NBC's Monica Alba and NBC's Courtney Kube joins me also from the Pentagon. Monica, let me start with you. You are watching all of this unfold. We've seen some reports of tourists not able to get into the Lincoln Memorial, and I think clearly one of the big differences here from years past is that suddenly there is a VIP section for the best seats in the house that, it used to be whoever, the egalitarian ruled the day, first come first served. 
- That's right, Kasie, exactly. And as you can see over my shoulder those preps continue. And we're actually gonna be able to show you exactly where President Trump is gonna be speaking from tomorrow evening. And as you can see, the customary bullet-proof glass that surrounds the President at such a large-scale public event. But to your point about the tickets, this is open and free to the public, but certainly those who have access to tickets from the Republican National Committee, and even the Trump Campaign are actually gonna have some of the best seats in the house. Those folks are gonna be kind of in a primary section in the front and they'll actually have a very good view it seems, of some of those military vehicles that you mentioned. So, right now we can actually see there is a Bradley fighting vehicle which was parked over on 23rd and Independence, and moved here just a short time ago. Just a small fraction of the military might that will be on full display tomorrow. And of course that's what the President wants. He wants these optics and he wants to show this to the world and he was inspired actually first two summers ago when he was in Paris with President Emmanuel Macron at that military parade and said, Hey I would really like to do this in Washington. So, originally, the idea was gonna be to do that over a Veteran's Day holiday, but of course that got scrapped because the price tag was so high. So that's one of the big questions here too, we don't know how much it's gonna cost, there are a lot of elements here, there are gonna be military fly overs, there will be all the military branches represented. And then of course the big question, will this turn more campaign rally than a typically non-partisan event? That all remains to be seen, but we can see as the preps get under way, and they're doing some sound checks here, they are getting ready and yes security has been tight. There aren't tourists allowed inside the Lincoln Memorial anymore and they probably won't be allowed until this event is all over tomorrow. This taking center stage here on the National Mall, Kasie. 
- Courtney Kube, to pick up on that point Monica was making about the risk of it turning it into a campaign rally, I mean first of all, how unusual is this for the United States military to be involved in a production like this? How much historically is this something that they are used to doing and second of all, what is the level of concern around the possibility of politics to play into an event that, I mean obviously we know our military leaders are typically supposed to steer clear of that. 
- So, of course the military is not allowed to be involved officially in any kind of political event. There are very specific rules and candidly in the last year or two, we've seen more and more guidelines and memos just in the past several weeks than acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan put out a memo with guidelines reminding people that the military is apolitical. Fourth of July is typically not a military holiday. It's not like Veteran's Day where you see military leaders and bands and whatnot spread throughout the country and involved in these kinds of activities. Since this parade, the first of the planning, when we first heard mention of this parade, there has been concern from U.S. military leaders here in the Pentagon and around, that this could turn into some sort of a political rally that would become awkward for both the military leaders who are there and the military who are involved. Defense officials who we have spoken with this week say that they are assured that President Trump, his speech will be less than 20 minutes, he will speak for about four minutes about each service. There's some belief that he wants the joint chiefs, for the most part it will be the vice chairman, I'm sorry, the vice chiefs who will be there, that he wants each individual representative at some point to come up and stand with him, when they're reviewing their aircraft, when he's talking about them or whatever, but there is some concern that in fact that could look like some sort of a political statement or a political rally. But what's important to note here is that the Pentagon lawyers they went through this event as they do when there's any military participation in an event, and they found that in fact it is legal and they are allowed to both participate and attend this event, Kasie. 
- And so has the Pentagon reviewed the President's remarks, do they know what he's gonna say, to make sure that they are comfortable having their guys stand up next to him? 
- At this point, not that they are aware of that they've reviewed him. All they've been given is this guidance that he wills speak about the various services here. So, at this point assuming the weather holds out and they have these fly overs, each of the military services will be represented with this air show. You mentioned there's gonna be the F-22's, F-35's, the Blue Angels, they will all culminate with the Navy's Blue Angels, who of course, they participate in any number of recruiting events all over the country, all over the world. So that won't be uncommon. But what we don't quite know yet is exactly, will the President stick to the script here, or will he go off on a political tangent, Kasie? 
- Always the question, Monica Abla, Courtney Kube, thank you guys both, very much. Today, the country said farewell to a hero. One more thing, up next.

- One more thing before we go. Today, in New York, the city and world said goodbye to 9/11 first responder Luis Alvarez. Chances are, you know the NYPD detective from his final days spent on Capitol Hill fighting for law makers to continue funding for the 9/11 compensation fund. But Alvarez became an American hero long before then. Atop the rubble of ground zero, spending months combing for survivors and remains. Many of them his fellow fallen comrades, despite having trouble breathing, Detective Alvarez kept going, like many others did, after the EPA told them the air at ground zero was just fine. But it wasn't. Three years ago, Alvarez began his fight against colon cancer. Despite growing weak from round after round of chemo, he never stopped fighting. 
- You made me come down here the day before my 69th round of chemo. And I'm gonna make sure that you never forget to take care of the 9/11 responders. If I can help just one more first responder, then it makes it all worthwhile for me. Really, it sounds like a cliche, but it's the truth. 
- [Kasie] Sadly, Alvarez never made it to that 69th round of chemo, instead going into hospice shortly after he returned from Capitol Hill. He passed away this weekend, joining more than 2,000 first responders to pass away from illnesses related to their work at ground zero. At today's ceremony, in the same church he grew up attending after moving from Cuba at just one year old, his priest relayed the single request that Luis had for his funeral: that we all remember the brave men and women who went before him and those who continue to fight now that he's gone. Today, as the 53 year old was remembered, the last words he's known to have said were recited quote, At the end, the only thing that matters is how much we loved. May he rest in peace. That wraps things up for this hour. I'm Kasie Hunt in Washington. Please do follow me on Twitter and catch me every Sunday night on Kasie DC. Ali Velshi picks things up from New York right now. 
- Kasie thank you, have yourself a great rest of the afternoon and a happy Fourth of July.
