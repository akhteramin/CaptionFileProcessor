- It's only fitting to say God bless Texas, thanks guys. 
- Amen. 
- Appreciate it. 
- Evening everyone, and welcome to The Next Revolution. I'm Steve Hilton and this is the home of the positive populism, pro-worker, pro-family, pro-community, and of course always, but especially on this July the Fourth holiday weekend, pro-America. And that's where we start tonight. There was a time when being pro-America was a given for politicians in both main parties. Of course President Reagan put it beautifully when he talked of a shining city on a hill. But I also love Bill Clinton's great line, There's nothing wrong with America that can't be fixed by what's right with America. But this week, this July the fourth, we saw that those days are gone. Yes, we still have a Republican president who, like Ronald Reagan is obviously proud of America and happy to say it, to celebrate it, but today's Democrats, no, they're embarrassed by America. Far from celebrating America, they want to tear it down and turn it into something else. That's the background to President Trump's Salute to America on Independence Day, the Democrats couldn't wait to attack it. 
- Donald Trump, I believe, is incapable of celebrating what makes America great because I don't think he gets it. 
- He doesn't get it, okay look. Here's some of what the president actually said. 
- Together we are part of one of the greatest stories ever told, the story of America. It is the spirit, daring, and defiance, excellence, and adventure, courage, and confidence, loyalty, and love that built this country into the most exceptional nation in the history of the world. And our nation is stronger today than it ever was before. 
- I think you'll find Joe China that President Trump gets what makes America great than a knackered old swamp creature who took billions of dollars in bribes in the form of payments to his family businesses from America's number one enemy. You are the last person to lecture anyone on patriotism, hashtag JoeChina. But it wasn't just him, it was all of them. How dare you celebrate America, cried the left, it's not who we are. 
- It's just not who we are as Americans. We don't thump our chest, put tanks in the streets, fly jets over the Mall to prove our strength. 
- I think reducing our nation to tanks and shows of muscle just makes us look like the kinda loud-mouth guy at the bar. 
- I think it's a waste of money. He's having a parade for himself, putting tanks out there for himself, and if he really cares about the men and women who are serving our nation, he'd be investing in higher pay, better housing, better healthcare. 
- By the way, that is exactly what President Trump has done, unlike President Obama, you total charlatan Kirsten Gillibrand. But the big point is captured in that smug platitude trotted out there by the ridiculous Eric Swalwell, and the rest of the left these days, It's not who we are. For once that told phrase told us something useful about the Democrats this week, just not the way they intended. The proud Americans who stood in the pouring rain in front of the Lincoln Memorial to celebrate their country on July the Fourth know that's not who the Democrats are. The millions more who watched at home and thought finally we have a president who loves America as much as we do and isn't embarrassed to say so, no that is not who the Democrats are. The Democrats won't celebrate America because their new ideology demands that they denigrate America, not least with their reckless, divisive lies about concentration camps at the border, collusion with Russia, and Hitler in the White House. Today's Democrats are engaged in a concerted effort to smear this country at home and in the eyes of the world. When they tell you they don't want to celebrate America because it's not who we are, believe them. President Trump, by contrast, laid out exactly why we should celebrate. The American spirit he talked about on Independence Day has driven some of the most profound human achievements in history, from medical breakthroughs to artistic glories, to engineering and technological marvels. American ingenuity has continually confounded what the world thinks is possible. But why, how? It's not just chance or luck. There are other countries with other people just as talented and ingenious. Here's my perspective as a recent arrival. It is America's greatest achievement that has made all the others possible, and that is the genius framework constructed by the founders and expressed in the founding documents, all in service of that simple but revolutionary idea, liberty under the law. It's the guarantee of individual liberty that gave the pioneers the confidence to set out into the unknown, that gave the entrepreneurs the belief they could build something better, that convinced communities they could govern themselves. Power to the people, decentralized and limited government, the rule of law, these are the foundation of the American spirit, and they have paved the way, not only for America's long-lasting democracy, but also our world-beating economic system in which investment, innovation, and above all, success, are rewarded not punished. And look at the difference it makes when we have an administration that believes in those American economic values, another incredible jobs report last week, incomes rising fastest for those who are left behind under the Democrats, record low unemployment, and a fairer economy. For example the gap between white and African American unemployment has shrunk by nearly a half since 2016. The Obama years gave us lower growth and higher inequality. With President Trump's pro-America economics we have the exact opposite, higher growth and lower inequality. But those facts don't matter to the Democrats. They've been captured by an extremist ideology that is fundamentally anti-American. You saw it at their debates the other week, and it connects everything, their economic policies, environmental policies, healthcare policies, and yes their hysterical reaction to President Trump's Salute to America. Not celebrating America, but denigrating America. Now power to the people, but power for themselves and the bureaucratic elite. Not decentralized government, but everything controlled from Washington, D.C. The Democrats don't want limited government, they want endless, relentless, extravagant intervention by an all-knowing, all-seeing, all-powerful state. And here's perhaps the biggest change from the Democrats of the past. Today's Democrats don't even want the most vital element of the American inheritance, the rule of law. At their first presidential debate, almost all of the 2020 candidates backed the decriminalization of illegal immigration. On Wednesday one of them, Cory Booker, escorted migrants towards the US border himself. Even President Obama's former Homeland Security Secretary now says the Democrats are effectively for open borders. The Democrats point to the Statue of Liberty and say that immigration control is un-American. But they forget one vital thing, it's not just liberty, it's liberty under the law, and it is their blatant, thuggish assault on the rule of law that is truly un-American. Let me end on a personal note about America. I'm an immigrant here, just as my parents were in England after they fled Communism in Hungary. I've always been pro-immigration, how could I be anything else? But it's especially those of us who believe in the virtues and benefits of immigration who should want to see it properly controlled. Because public consent for immigration depends on government control of immigration. That's why immigration has to be done the right way, according to the rules. That's certainly how I've done it since I moved here with my family seven years ago, and I thought this July the Fourth weekend was a good moment to let you know that I've now begun the process of applying for U.S. citizenship. I can't tell you how much I appreciate the opportunities this country has given me, and the welcome you've all shown me. And now I'm looking forward one day to celebrating Independence Day as an American, if you'll have me, that is. Let me know, @SteveHiltonX, and @NextRevFNC. Here now, our guests for the night, Trump 2020 Campaign Senior Advisor, Katrina Pierson, and Fox News Contributor, former Utah Congressman, and author of the new book Power Grab Jason Chaffetz. All right, lots of topics in there, immigration, the Democrats going nuts. Where do you wanna start? 
- Well I think I'll start by saying of course we welcome you. 
- That's a relief, thank you. 
- I applaud you on your efforts there. We need more Americans that fight like you for this country. But you know I think you have it exactly right. They're not even hiding it anymore, Steve. The Democrats are anti-American. And we see it, and we've seen it for the last few years. They didn't even have a flag, during the debate that you mentioned that they had last week, on stage. They've been fighting the flag for the last few years. They're anti-American, period. 50% of Americans are deplorables, and the other 50% are just as expendable because their main focus and priority are on the families and children of illegal aliens and foreign nationals on the way. So I think you're absolutely right. I think most Americans see that. And there were Democrats at that event in Washington, D.C., who watched this president and who were excited to be there because there are some Democrats left in this country who love it, and who support it, because it is the United States of America. It is the best country in the world. It is exactly why everyone is trying to come here. 
- [Steve] Yes that's right, and I'm one of them, exactly. 
- And it's so upsetting when you show clips that you showed, what these Democrats were saying. Frankly in my opinion, any presidential candidate that is criticizing saluting America on Independence Day should be disqualified. 
- I think, well said, I mean look, Jason, the Democrats would say that's outrageous, we're not anti-American, we just have a different set of ideas about how to bring about change and everything. But when you actually look at the way they're running around deliberately distorting and making stuff up to make America look bad, and then when you look at the fundamentals of their shift to the left, it contradicts something very important about the kind of spirit and soul of this country. 
- The president believes in American exceptionalism. I believe in it, and yet Democrats are almost embarrassed about the country, they're embarrassed about the flag, they're embarrassed that this president has wrapped himself in the flag, I mean literally. Remember that scene where he came out and he hugged the flag? But I think that's why the overwhelming majority of Americans love this president, because it's the one thing that's supposed to draw us together, is the flag of the United States of America. It shouldn't be a partisan issue, but the Democrats are choosing to make it a partisan issue, and I think they do so at their own political peril. And I really like the sum of what you're saying in your opening statement, which I absolutely loved, which is this idea that the rule of law does give us the liberty, and we do believe in limited government, and there is a fundamental difference between what the Democrats believe in, which is more, bigger government, and what President Trump is fighting for which is to increase our liberties by giving the American people more chances, more opportunities, and a better economy in which to thrive economically. 
- Yeah, because in the past, I think, you could say that political debate over policy areas was within a framework that was recognizably American, and different from anywhere else in the world. It was really interesting to me when President Trump had that great line in his speech to Congress, This will never be a socialist country. Anywhere else in the world, that would have been a really weird thing to say. People would have said well maybe it will, maybe it won't, we'll see what happens in the election, but actually, everyone just thought that makes sense here because there's something about the way socialism demands this total centralized government that just is fundamentally anti-American. 
- Well it is, and the people in this country won't allow it, regardless of how things proceed down the line. But to Jason's point, they were all about big government, but it's not about big government. It is about power, they just don't say that. In order to have all of the power, they have to have the government as big as possible so that they can control everyone, they'll exempt themselves, just like they've always done in the past. But it is about power and this erratic derangement that we see among the Democrats and in the media, although I repeat myself, is really coming from this trauma of the November 2016 election. And they grasp onto this toxicity, and that's why you see them constantly attacking innocent people as deplorable, and you see them attacking inanimate objects because now they're unhinged because, and we know this to be true, because you saw this debate. You had this plethora of Democrat candidates out there who were saying outrageous things with ridiculously stupid policies, and then what do we have today? President Trump's approval is now the highest it's ever been and that gives you a clue on where Americans stand on these issues today. 
- Well we're gonna look, I'm sorry, out of time Jason, but we're gonna look at the policy shift to the left a bit later in the show. And I just want to add as well as the deb-roar-ah's thing was so deeply revealing of where they are, and even though they're gonna say oh we mustn't make that mistake again, and they say oh we must understand the heartland, and so on, you know they way they talk and act they really look down their nose from a cultural perspective 
- Yep. 
- Absolutely. 
- at America, even the food they eat, and that's why they can't stand Donald Trump because he kinda connects with that and represents that and gives voice to that. All right, before we take a break I have to mention the U.S. women's soccer team winning the World Cup earlier today. What a great way to close out July the Fourth weekend, many, many congratulations to the whole squad for a fantastic and inspiring achievement. After the break, the people versus Chief Justice John Roberts. Yes, it's gonna be a controversial one, don't go away.

- This week the Trump administration announced that it still intends to put a citizenship question on the 2020 census, despite an unfavorable ruling in the Supreme Court the previous week which temporarily blocked the plan. But whatever the arguments about the census question, there was an aspect of the ruling, and especially the majority opinion from the Chief Justice, that will have long-lasting and disastrous consequences for the country way beyond the census. And so tonight, it's the people versus Chief Justice John Roberts. The argument used by the Chief Justice to block the citizenship question was that the rationale for the change given by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is that he was responding to a request from the Justice Department wasn't the real reason. Documents showed that he was planning to put the citizenship question on the census before the Justice Department request came in. But so what, under the Constitution, it's an executive branch decision that has long been a legal precedent in this country that the courts can't object to executive branch actions just because there are other reasons for the decision than those stated. John Roberts has just overturned that precedent, and this will have massive and deeply damaging implications for the way things work, or rather don't work, in America. In the dissent of the case, written by Justice Clarence Thomas, and joined by Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, he wrote, The court has opened a Pandora's Box of pretext-based challenges in administrative law. All right, so what does all this mean in plain English, and what does it mean for you? How many times have you been frustrated that something this administration wants to do has been overruled, overturned, struck down, slowed down, or watered down by the courts? You voted to build the wall, but the courts said no. You voted to defund sanctuary cities, but the courts said no. On DACA, on asylum, on healthcare, on rolling back some regulations, even on blocking immigration from failed states with high levels of terrorism, the courts said no to policies that you voted for. All in all, unelected judges have ruled against the Trump administration more than 70 times in the last three years, way more than the rate for previous administrations. This is what happens when you vote for a populist revolution. The establishment tries to overturn it through undemocratic means. And now this ruling from Chief Justice Roberts will make it all 10 times worse. From now on, any partisan pressure group will be able to take legal action against the administration on all sorts of spurious grounds, helping, as Justice Thomas says, quote, partisans to use the courts to harangue executive officers through depositions, discovery, delay, and distraction. Great, that's just what we need, an even more politicized judiciary, even more roadblocks in the way of actually getting things done that help your life. The worst of it all is John Roberts own rationale for this, his own motive, for him it is all about the image of the Court. Now that he's the swing vote, he doesn't want to make his court look partisan. So the other week he balanced his ruling on gerrymandering with this damaging one on judicial review of executive decisions. But he's supposed to be the Chief Justice, not the chief PR. He's supposed to interpret the Constitution, not what the media will say about his court. This ruling will hurt America for years to come. It should haunt Chief Justice Roberts for the rest of his time on the bench. But above all, it shows the importance of taking his power away by reelecting Donald Trump so he can put Roberts in the minority where he belongs. Okay, tell me what you think of that, @SteveHiltonX and @NextRevFNC. Jason Chaffetz. 
- No, well said. I think this is one of the worst decisions and put on a list of bad decisions from Justice Roberts. I think Clarence Thomas had it right. You don't want these judges making subjective rulings from the bench based on whatever political whims that they want. Inherently the legislative branch is political, and it will change from time to time, but that's okay. You shouldn't have to state the reason and try to get into the mind and try to be the mind reader of what they were really looking for, especially in this case of the census where they have precedent in order to do it. So I know we're gonna talk more about that, but really this is a bad decision. They can't let the courts just try to be mind readers, and then subject their own will upon the court. That's not what they're supposed to do. 
- Yeah, I mean the thing is Katrina, some people have made the comparison with his decision on Obamacare back in 2012, wasn't it, where he basically voted to let most of it stand. And the real reason people speculated was that he didn't want to look as if he was killing off something that was just a political priority for the then-president. But now, for the same kind of reason, to sort of oh it's all about image, he's done something that actually wasn't just a one off thing like Obamacare, this will hurt so many different areas of policy, and stop, people are so frustrated, government, nothing ever happens, this is all just talk and nothing gets done, this is why. 
- Well it is why, and it seems like Chief Justice Roberts wants his legacy to be generational destruction. It was far worse back with Obamacare because it was unconstitutional and at that point in time you had Justice Roberts literally bent over backwards, trying to reform the individual mandate into a tax, therefore it would be good to go, something that our Congress, the people who actually represent the people, didn't even vote on. There was no tax that was voted on with Obamacare, but oh this is fine, let's just push this right on through. And that has been destructive for generations, as we've seen, and now here we are with something that, to Jason's point, it's not unprecedented. This was a question that was on the census before in history so it's not brand new, it's not like the president seizing power of anything, and the intent by someone who recommended it, now all of the sudden is directing the Supreme Court of the United States? This is insanity? 
- That's what drives me crazy. I've worked inside of a government, you've obviously been in Con, there's so many factors, and conversations, and meetings, and discussions, and memos, all of that, now can be got hold of by any kind of legal challenge of any kind of political decision, it's a total nightmare. 
- And there are those of us that are worried that when it goes to the courts, they can make that sorta subjective analysis and say well this one's right and this one's not right. That's not what they're supposed to do. The court is supposed to rule whether or not they can add a question or not, it should be that simple. But they've opened up this box because, I think you're exactly right Steve, it's not just this case. It is going to live on in perpetuity, and it will create all kinds of problems. It will empower the court more to make subjective decisions. 
- And court all the way down, this is not just, 
- Yes. 
- You have the state level, it just opens up this possibility that you try and get anything done, I mean we already know how bad it is, it's just gonna get worse. And people are gonna get more disillusioned with politics and government because it's gonna get even more impossible to do anything. 
- Well we've always said that it's President Trump against the world, and every day we see that to be true, more and more over time. But hopefully the president will be able to move forward on this either through executive action or some other manner, to again force this through the court system. It is common sense, a country has a right to know who's in it. This is not some weird twisted thing that they're trying to make it out to be. This is a power grab, this is what it is. The Democrats want as many people in this country as possible because the numbers, aside from whether or not they're citizens, gives them the electoral advantage when it comes to distribution of Congressman, and they want more of that. It is all about a power grab, that's what it's always been. They don't care about people, they don't care about race, they don't care about gender, they just want the people on their side. 
- Well there you are, so that, as you mentioned, we're gonna be talking more about that aspect of it, that was the sort of central ruling. I wanted to make sure everyone understood the wider implications of the ruling, but specific on the census question, we're gonna be talking about that on tomorrow's Deep Dive on Fox Nation, go to foxnation.com and sign up if you haven't done that already, gonna be a great discussion.

- Welcome back everyone. Last week I had the chance to talk to Missouri Senator Josh Hawley about his positive and practical plan to protect the U.S. from the China threat, take a look. One of the members of Congress who has been toughest on the threat from China is Senator Josh Hawley from Missouri, he joins us now. Senator, I've been watching what you've been doing and saying on China with great approval, I'm very excited to talk to you about it. First of all, big picture, how would you set out for us the threat from China? 
- The threat from China is the most significant threat of the 21st century in many ways. I mean they've already taken our jobs, Steve. They're trying to steal our technology. They're trying to build their military on the back of our middle class. And it's time that we got tough with China, I mean we can't continue to allow them to run roughshod over us. That means getting tough with them on trade. It means getting tough with them on stealing our technology and stealing our jobs. 
- One specific aspect I think that you've rightly focused on is the connection between our technology companies and the Chinese military, and you've got a specific proposal on that, tell us about that. 
- My proposal is this, that Chinese researchers who want to come over to the United States should have to, and work on sensitive technologies in our labs, should have to go through background screening to make sure that they're not actually agents of the Chinese government or the Chinese military. It's just an additional layer of security to make sure that, again, China is not using their researchers to be spies. And unfortunately we know that China has tried to do this, and by the way so has Russia, and so has Iran. So my bill would put a stop to that. It would say that you've gotta go through this extra background check if you wanna work on sensitive technology in American labs. 
- What about the way in which China over the years has really kind of burrowed into our establishment, not just academia and the scientific world, as you've just described, the technology world, but honestly when you look at Washington and the Chinese influence through think tanks, and lobbying, and so on, there's one particularly egregious example that we've highlighted on this show, which is President Obama's former Head of Cybersecurity, now working for Jones Day, a law firm in Washington, D.C., as a declared lobbyist for Huawei, which our government has designated a national security threat. Don't you think that whole practice of lobbying for a foreign government that is basically a strategic threat to this country should not just be declared, as it has been in this case, but actually outlawed? 
- I would say that that's very, very concerning, Steve, and you are absolutely right that the Chinese government, the Chinese military has worked to gain access to our universities, to think tanks. They have worked to weaponize in many ways our free system, whether it's our open trade system, which they have cheated at systematically for years, or whether it's trying to conduct espionage on our own college campuses, or whether it's forcing American companies who want to do business in China to sign these technology transfer agreements whereby they take all of our tech and then ultimately don't give us access to the market anyway. So it is time that we realized the threat that China poses to our middle class, to our safety and security, and got serious about it. 
- Would you go so far as to say that there's a comparison here with the Cold War and the Soviet Union? A lot of people are talking in those terms. And that actually we should really be looking at some kind of systematic disengagement, or at least reducing our dependence on China, because we would never have made ourselves so economically, and technologically, and in other ways dependent on the Soviet Union, would we? 
- I think we absolutely need to make sure we are not dependent on China. And we need to recognize them for what they are, which is at best a strategic competitor, probably an adversary. I mean just look right now Steve at how they're trying to hold hostage farmers, for instance, farmers in my state, making them the focus of retaliation on these tariffs. That's the kind of game China plays, they cheat, and then when you try to hold them accountable, they strike back, they try to inflict pain. We've got to put ourselves in a position to compete with them, to win, and to protect our people. 
- All right, last question. So we've been really focusing on one particular individual and his connections to China, that's former vice president Joe Biden. We've been telling our audience week after week how he is compromised by China, while he was vice president, billions of dollars from the Chinese state to Biden family businesses. It seems to me extraordinary that there's no real interest in following this up, other than here and a few other places on this channel. What do you think we should, don't you think that this should be properly investigated? Joe China as I like to call him should be investigated. 
- Absolutely, I think we need to follow the evidence to where it leads, and you can see in Joe Biden's comments about China saying that they're not really a threat, saying that they really aren't a competitor, that we don't have anything to worry about. I mean, Steve, the best thing you can say about that is is that it's just totally ignorant, I mean it is willful ignorance. China is a huge threat to us, and they have been for years. Look at the jobs that they have taken from American workers, from workers in my home state of Missouri, and that's the tip of the iceberg. They wanna be a global superpower at our expense. We cannot let them. 
- All right, well I'm really pleased to see that you recognize this threat for what it is and you're there fighting on behalf of our national interest. Great to see you this evening, thank you Senator. 
- Thank you.

If your current treatment isn't working, ask your doctor about Entyvio. Entyvio acts specifically in the GI tract to prevent an excess of white blood cells from entering and causing damaging inflammation. Entyvio has helped many patients achieve long-term relief and remission. Infusion and serious allergic reactions can happen during or after treatment. Entyvio may increase risk of infection, which can be serious. PML, a rare, serious, potentially fatal brain infection caused by a virus may be possible. Tell your doctor if you have an infection, experience frequent infections, or have flu-like symptoms or sores. Liver problems can occur with Entyvio. Ask your doctor about the only GI-focused biologic, just for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's. Entyvio, relief and remission within reach.

- Remember Jeffrey Epstein, the hedge fund billionaire who ran a repulsive under-age sex pyramid scheme and was handed a cushy plea deal by Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta who was then Florida U.S. Attorney, amounting to 13 months in county jail with work release? In a Swamp Watch last December, I called for Acosta's resignation for his role in this horrific abuse of justice. You helped cover up a billionaire's pedophile sex crimes on an epic scale. Now you're in President Trump's cabinet, and I think you owe all of us an explanation and an apology. And if you can't do that, it's time for you to go. Well the skeleton in Acosta's closet is back in the public eye following Epstein's arrest this weekend on charges of sex trafficking. So will we finally see some accountability from Alex Acosta? In my view, it really is time for him to go. Look, I think what drives people crazy, in this case and in so many others, Katrina, is this sense that people just do things in their past, life moves on, it's the swamp, there's no accountability, no one's actually held responsible for things that they did. 
- Well look, I think, specifically for this case, you literally have to go back to 2002 to really grasp the bizarre circumstances that have surrounded this case and the people around it. And it is quite disturbing when you look at all of the allegations, dozens of women, young girls, which I have a zero tolerance policy for, and I think at this point, if you are the story, that's a problem. And I think that's where we are today, given the new arrest, and we'll know tomorrow when we see what the actual charges are, if these indeed are new. There are reports that these are new charges, new allegations from recent people. And if that turns out to be true, then we probably should look at making some significant changes, if this turns out to be what it's said to be. 
- [Steve] What do you make of it? 
- I think the Chief of Staff, the acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, has probably had some serious discussions with the Labor Secretary. Serving in the president's cabinet is a privilege, it is not a right. Every time I've seen Donald Trump in action, when there has been a flare up, and there has been something where somebody has gone over the line, the president has taken care of this. I would be surprised in this case if the president allowed it to continue and fester. He's taking some op eds and some serious concern from people that are big fans of the president. I don't see why this person, or how this person can continue on. And I think you were ahead of your time by calling it out in December, and it's exacerbated by what's going on now. 
- We should be clear, it's not anything he's done since President Trump appointed him, this is, as you said, long time ago. But there's something about it, it's so egregious, it's so revolting, you just think come on. 
- Well there, you have to deal with it. And when you continue to make yourself the issue and distract from the president's agenda, you no longer need to be serving there. And this is not going to go away, this case is gonna continue on. And the coziness and the relationship, I think the more people look at how this guy, the Labor Secretary, dealt with it back then is really bad stuff. 
- Well you know the argument they're making is that even through his confirmation hearing, there were U.S. Attorney Generals who, U.S. Attorneys who looked at this over three different administrations, so there was something maybe we don't know that was going on at that point in time, and the government does what the government does, and we don't always know why. But I do think that now, if true, that these allegations are new and recent, then all of those things are gonna be opened. And at that point, either he should say something, or step aside so this can play out. 
- And remember, the Labor Secretary is the one that's supposed to oversee human trafficking. So it just gets even worse because of the fact that that's his job, is supposed to be overseeing human trafficking, and his record on human trafficking, just based on this one case alone, is horrific. 
- Just to sort of wrap that up, this guy Epstein, you know the real villain of the peace, for years it seems he's gotten away with it, and looks like finally now in this administration he might be getting the justice he deserves. All right, coming up, after this past week, it's clear the loonies have taken over the Democrat party, Loony Left is next.

- After 40, a guy loses free testosterone, even me. I couldn't stay in shape like I used to. 
- Frank!

- So does Nugenix really work? 
- Yes, it's the number one selling free testosterone booster at GNC. 
- Okay great, but does it work for you? 
- Oh yeah, my workouts are incredible now. I'm feeling stronger, more energetic, with a lot more drive. 
- So say I knew someone who should try Nugenix. How does he do that? 
- It's easy, just send a text to get a complimentary bottle. 
- [Announcer] Frank's right, now you can claim a complimentary bottle of award-winning Nugenix by texting NEW to 321321. Its unique man-boosting formula is powered by Testofen, a patented key ingredient clinically researched to help a man feel stronger, leaner, more energetic, and more passionate.

- This is not 2016, this is 2020, and people are woke. 
- You can say that again. The entire Democratic party is this week's Loony Left. When Kamala Harris says, People are woke, she seems to be talking about her fellow candidates. The mainstream Democrat positions now look like they are open borders, free healthcare for illegal immigrants, abolition of private healthcare for American citizens, His-pandering, trans-pandering, woke-pandering. Yes, it's official, the Loony Left is no longer the fringe, it has taken over the Democratic Party. 
- I mean look, I mean this is just laughable. I mean when you see someone like Kamala Harris pandering to black people, you know there's a problem. And look, there is actually a nickname for her with my black friends and online, you see actual African Americans that call her Chameleon Harris because she is pandering. And the only people that are woke now because of her candidacy are the black people who are actually descendants from slaves because there's been this whole uproar because she's presenting herself, and the media's presenting herself as African American. She's an Islander American and she should be proud of that. But that's not what's happening. She's given in to what you just discussed, all of the His-pandering, the trans-pandering, and now she's trying to really beef up her African American credential by using, I guess, I don't know, woke. 
- I mean it's just ridiculous. I know he misspoke and has cleaned it up, but for example Julian Castro going on about abortions for trans women, it's just one example, just the endless pandering. 
- Reproductive justice. 
- And then you've got the policy shifts, where they all put their hand up for these positions that are so extreme, compared to just a couple of years ago. 
- Well and just recently the Democrats have just shown that they have a distaste and they don't like the flag, they don't like the Fourth of July celebration, they're embarrassed by anybody who wants to stand up and wrap themselves in the flag, and they put themselves in a terrible position. But I think that's when your focus is on pandering and just winning, as opposed to having a principle, and staking that principle in the ground. When you're rudder-less, this is what happens, you start meandering wherever the news of the day goes, and the next thing you know you're left with appeasing a very, very small percentage of Americans, and you're leaving 80% of the country, who loves the country, behind. 
- And what are they think this is, I mean do they think they can just kind of change all this when it comes to the general election, once they've finished with their pandering, and whoever the nominee is gets elected, they can just sort of ditch all this, or what? 
- Well I mean that's the plan, the plan is to win the primary. And you have the furthest of the left, the ones that are actually falling of the cliff, these are the people that the Democrats are pandering to with all of the isms that are out there. As ridiculous as it sounds, they do believe this is some sort of strategy because what we've seen is I don't think they have any intention on moving to the center, even after the general election because they're not going to move. 
- That's the interesting question is this is, as you might say it's worse than that, they really mean it. 
- They mean it. 
- Exactly, and this Trump derangement syndrome, I think is very real. 
- It's very real. 
- Because if Donald Trump likes the flag, they don't like it. If he is wanting to protect the border, then they want open borders. It doesn't mean, doesn't seem to matter. 
- It's interesting though, I wanna focus on the open borders thing because that one really interests me particularly, because they hate that label. They always say, We're not for open borders, but it's fascinating to see, over the last couple of weeks, since that debate, you've had so many commentators, actually a lot of them real Trump-hating columnists and so on, and today, I think yesterday, Jay Johnson Obama's Homeland Security Secretary, all saying some version of they are effectively open borders, they are functionally open borders. You know, critics of Donald Trump basically saying this really is the official position now of the Democratic Party, open borders. 
- Well it is, I mean to the point to where they don't even wanna fund ICE. They don't even want to protect the interior from the open borders that they want. They are definitely supportive of open borders, mainly because, again they need the votes, but when you have people like AOC and all of the new Democrats out there that are pushing these kinds of policies, it really makes them look even more loony than they really are, but they do believe it. And I mean, and the thing about it is when you're going into 2020, I think that the position is very clear, the voters are gonna have a choice. You're either gonna vote for America, or you're gonna vote for a Democrat, and you can't get any more clear than that at this point. 
- Remember, AOC and the whole lot of the Democrats were saying there's no crisis at the border, there's no crisis, it's just fiction. And now they're yelling and screaming because there isn't enough money to take care of these people, well you voted against it, and you wouldn't support the idea that they need money at HHS and Border Patrol 
- Oh it's so ridiculous. 
- to take care of 'em. 
- It's so hypocritical. Anyway, whatever, there's more fun to be had because coming up Joe China is back doing what he does best, sticking his foot in his mouth. We've got the tape and you're gonna really enjoy it. That is next.

- All right welcome back everyone. Now Joe Biden, he's done an interview, always good for a laugh, we've picked some highlights for you. Here is the former vice president talking about world leaders and how he'd handled them. 
- I took on Putin in terms of Iraq, I mean excuse me in terms of what was going on in Ukraine. I've taken on these leaders around the world. I'm the guy that's gone in and meant it. I've taken on all these lead. 
- Okay, I'm the guy, he went in there and took on Putin over Iraq, whatever it was. So if you could make out anything from that sort of rambling incoherence it was that he stood up to, but of course he didn't. They basically did nothing when Putin walked into Crimea and Ukraine, and it's President Trump that has gotten tough with Russia. And as for standing up to other countries, China, I mean my goodness. Joe Biden when he was vice president went soft on China, as we keep telling you, because the government put billions of dollars into his son's businesses. Anyway, if you thought that was funny, just watch this. 
- Come on man, come on man, come on. Come here man, come on, come on man. Hey man, no deal mean. I'd smack them in the mouth. 
- Okay, and then, honestly almost straight after that he said this. 
- I think the American people want a president who has some dignity. 
- Dignity. Come on man, I'm gonna smack you in the mouth. And he says we need a president with dignity. I mean it's just, I don't know where to start. 
- I don't know, I think Uncle Joe might have taken a nap. I think he was kinda sleepy during the debate, so now he's trying to find his way back. I mean it was really interesting when he said that there wouldn't be Russia meddling on my watch, it kinda was your watch guy. 
- Right! 
- It was funny, you know I kinda feel sorry for him at this point, I really do. He actually bragged about Obama entrusting him with the power and authority for Ukraine. And you've covered extensively how that went down. And so I do, I think I just feel sorry for Uncle Joe at this point. 
- The facts are elusive to Joe Biden. This is what happens when you're elected in 1972. He has literally been in that, in an elected office that long. I think he is, I think the Democrats smell blood in the water, I don't think he'll be the nominee. I think they're circling hard, and I think they just need to let Joe keep talking because he's gonna talk himself right out of it. There's a reason why he failed multiple times before to become the president. 
- It's just brilliant. 
- There's a reason why his staffer had to step in to end the interview when your staffer 
- Is that right? 
- has to step in, 
- How about during the debate? 
- come on. 
- How about during the debate when you say, well I gotta catch an Uber, or whatever it is that he was saying? 
- Oh my time is up. 
- It's so bad. 
- It's pretty bad. 
- You know the thing is it's just, it makes me laugh, so President Trump has said, he doesn't give much away, but he said, Actually I'd like to face Biden, 'cause he's so terrible. And a lot oh he's playing some double game or whatever. I don't think he is, I think he really means it because he's so terrible. 
- Yeah, he is, I think it would be great to see President Trump debate Joe Biden on stage. 
- Oh yes. People would love. 
- We could actually charge admission for that one incident. I think it would be quite a scene for America. But in all seriousness, Joe Biden really should reconsider what he's doing just for his own legacy, mainly because of all of the issues that he has. To Jason's point, he's been in politics for four decades, so it's gonna be extremely hard to constantly defend his position when every other week he's gonna have to apologize for that position, just because all of the 30 other contenders are gonna call him out on it. 
- That's right, he should be, like we were talking about with Loony Left, he's just being pushed to the left the whole time. Last word, Jason. 
- No, Democrats are gonna select somebody, but the path to get there is gonna be a hard one. But if Donald Trump keeps playing his A game, he will be reelected I have no doubt. I think he's stronger politically today than he's ever been. 
- When you see these candidates, and not just their performance as with Biden there, but the policy, in the end, President Trump won not just because he was so strong as a campaigner, but it was policy, it was the issues and the arguments he made. And when you see the arguments that are coming from the other side, well. All right, that's all for tonight. My thanks to Katrina and Jason and to you for watching.
