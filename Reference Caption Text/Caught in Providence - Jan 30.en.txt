- It got infected, so they had to remove the bone, like the skull. 
- Francesca? 
- Yes. 
- If I follow normal protocol on this, you'll end up with no car. 
- [Announcer] This is the courtroom of Judge Frank Caprio, where people and cases are met with compassion, a different kind of judge, a courtroom like no other, this is Caught in Providence. 
- Who's Mr. Holder? 
- This is Mr. Holder, Your Honor. 
- And are you here with him? 
- Yes, I'm his counselor at the Riverwood program. 
- Okay, who's gonna do the speaking? 
- I am at Mr. Holder's request. 
- [Frank] Alright, what do you wanna tell me about this? 
- Basically he received the ticket on Sunday morning, it started all his first park-
- 
- Saturday. 
- I'm sorry? 
- Saturday. 
- Saturday morning, I'm sorry, it's not at all his first ticket. 
- He's had 31 tickets. 
- Obviously I'm his counselor for significant reasons, at the same time it's something that we're working on engagingly with Mr. Holder and truthfully speaking, the tickets are becoming further and further apart. He happened to have been parked across from Parenside Park in front of the old Bank of America building on this particular morning, he was attending a church service. Sometimes he goes there also to meet up with his daughter, who's currently in a homeless situation. So we are hoping that Your Honor could find a reason hopefully to waive this and know that we're working actively in terms of keeping this from happening. 
- Is he homeless now? 
- Currently speaking he lives with his father at an assisted living residence in East providence, but actually we have an appointment next week with the Gateway group to hopefully line up housing, affordable housing in North Providence. 
- Tell me about the program, I don't know what the program is about. 
- We're a social services agency, we're under the Horizon Group, we have two locations, one in Providence, one in Warren, Rhode Island, you know, in the East Bay area. From there on out, Mr. Holder's been a longtime client of ours and I've been working as his counselor throughout the last nine months. 
- What's the name of the program? 
- Riverwood, one word. 
- Are you familiar with that? 
- [Ziggy] No, but I am familiar with Horizon, I have heard of that. 
- It's basically human services and social work, primarily the role of the Providence program is to provide affordable housing for low income individuals. 
- Based on your representations, I'm gonna dismiss it. 
- Thank you. 
- But I want Mr. Holder to know that this doesn't give you a license in the future to say it's okay, I'll bring my counselor down, I can get away with it, okay, I'm doing this based on his representation. Do you understand that? You explain it to him, when he gets out, 'cause he's homeless, okay, alright. 
- It's our intention to avoid it, if at all possible, thank you, Your Honor. 
- Okay. I'm just trying to see if he gives me attitude. 
- Despite what you may be thinking, I believe this motorist actually made two wise choices in court today, the first, having his social worker speak for him. Can you imagine what would have happened, if he had opened his mouth? I think he'd still be enjoying the hospitality of one of our local correctional institutions. The second is that he waited until he passed Inspector Kerrigan, before he disrespected the judge. Trust me, that may have been the wisest move of his life. 
- [Frank] Anthony Michael Giacobi, good morning, Mr. Giacobi. 
- Morning, sir. 
- What do your friends call you, they call you Tony, they call you AM, what do they call you? 
- I can't say what they call me. 
- I expected that kind of an answer. Where are you from, Nevada? 
- Yes, sir. 
- Yeah? What are you doing in Rhode Island? 
- What am I doing? I moved back here stupidly. 
- Are you calling me stupid? 
- I was thinking about it, but I-
- 
- Listen, I'm gonna tell you something, that's not nice. Mr. Giacobi, you're charged with going through a red light on Allens Avenue and Terminal Street, are we watching these today? We should watch it. 
- Yes, we need to see it, judge. 
- Alright, here's what we're gonna do, Mr. Giacobi, I'm gonna watch it. Now there are two lines on Allens Avenue, there are two stop lines, if you are passed the first stop line, when the light turns red, I'll dismiss it, if you're not passed it, it's gonna cost you 85 bucks, we're gonna take a look at it, look up here. 
- [Ziggy] It's already red, judge, show the time link, it was red for 16.2 seconds, judge. 
- If I look at this, I look at this every day and I'm supposed to know that when the light clicks three times, that it's red, I'm supposed to know that, I think we're all supposed to know that. So they send me this kind of a video, in a court of law, I can't tell what color the light is, I know it changed three times, Inspector Quinn, but it went from white to white to white. 
- No, it didn't change at all, judge. It stayed red according to the notice, but according to the video, I agree with you, judge, I couldn't determine as to whether-
- 
- No, I am not convinced by clear and convincing evidence, they didn't present clear and convincing evidence to me, that the light was red, I never saw red on the screen, I saw it all white. I know it changed three times, but I don't know if when it changed three times, what color it was. That's a very long story, but the result is that I'm gonna dismiss the case, because the city has failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that you went through a red light. Now is there anything you wanna say? 
- Thank you. 
- Oh. He's never told me what your friends call you. What do your friends call you, they call you Tony, they call you Anthony, what do they call you? 
- His middle name. 
- Thank you, sir. 
- Well, I guess we had it coming, the judge did ask him three times what his friends called him, based on his response, we know he wasn't lying, he really is an (bleep). 
- [Frank] Josev Parentos. 
- Good morning, Your Honor. 
- You've a parking ticket on Thayer Street, sir? 
- Yes. That day I wasn't driving the car, I was just getting out the hospital, 'cause I had brain surgery and my son literally parked at the corner of CVS and I got in the car and the lady said, You can't park there, it's a fire hydrant, and I said, oh, alright, I understand, I've had brain surgery, I had my helmet on and then she says, Yeah, sure, she didn't really believe me. I got in the car and then we left and then I got in the mail, the ticket, she didn't even give us a ticket on the way she was or anything. 
- Alright, case is dismissed. 
- I appreciate it, Your Honor, thank you. 
- Good luck. 
- Thanks. 
- How are you feeling? 
- Good. 
- I can't hear you, speak into the mic. 
- Alright. I had brain cancer surgery and then it got infected, so they had to remove the bone, like the skull of my head. 
- The skull? 
- Yeah. 
- So that's why you're wearing a helmet? 
- It's why I'm wearing a helmet, yes. 
- Yeah. 
- So hopefully in October I'm good. 
- Okay, we're rooting for you, good luck. 
- [Josev] I appreciate it, thank you. 
- I got divorced from him maybe about six or seven years ago, 
- [Frank] Yeah. 
- right before he went to federal prison for 15 years. 
- You're telling me all these bad things about him, but when he comes in, you let him use the car?

- [Frank] Kathy Acosta. Kathy, you have two red light violations. 
- Yeah, it wasn't me driving. 
- Who drives? 
- It was my ex-husband, he lives in Puerto Rico and the first one that he got, he said he paid it, now I get a second one in the mail and I'm furious. 
- Are you divorced from this guy? 
- Yes, I am. 
- [Frank] When did you get divorced? 
- Well, well. 
- A year ago, two years ago, six months ago, when? 
- Oh, I got divorced from him maybe about six or seven years ago. 
- [Frank] Yeah. 
- right before he went to federal prison for 15 years, just to explain what a good citizen he is. 
- Well, the fact of the matter is that the ticket was just issued last month. 
- Yeah, he just left last month. 
- Oh, he's your ex-husband, but he keeps, he's your ex-husband, but you still let him use your car? 
- Well, I try to be fair. 
- You're telling me all these bad things about him, but when he comes in, you let him use the car? 
- True, true, that's against me for being foolish. 
- No, no, it's not against you, I'm just trying to figure something out. 
- It's because we have a child together. She's grown now, but. 
- Let's take a look at it. There he goes right through the light, he don't care. Let's look at the other one. Yeah, that was a close one, alright, lights please. Kathy, I think you suffer from having a big heart, I think you're just too kind. 
- Suffered for a long time. 
- Yeah. 
- I've paid my dues. 
- Yeah, I'm gonna dismiss one of these, because you're paying. 
- Yeah, but what I wanted to do was to have him pay both of them, but on his license in Puerto Rico. 
- Kathy, when you receive these summons, on the back of the summons, if you had told us who was driving the car, then he would be held responsible, you didn't do that and the time for that has passed. So it's too late to do that. I would love to help you, if I could do it, I would do it, but it has no effect, if you had done it originally, then we would have notified the authorities there and he would have had a problem. Okay. 
- Lesson learned. 
- Good luck to you. Jennifer Cruz. Jennifer, get close to the mic. 
- Good morning, Your Honor. 
- [Frank] What is your daughter's name? 
- Marlenny. 
- What is it? 
- Marlenny. 
- She's very well behaved. 
- Thank you. 
- How old are you, honey? 
- I'm five years old. 
- Five? You wanna come up here? 
- Do you wanna go up there? 
- [Inspector Kerrigan] Come on. 
- Okay, you have three tickets. 
- Yes, I don't wish to contend, I was just hoping that you could, the late fees, I was hoping that you could take those off and I'd pay the tickets. 
- Okay. Do you have an excuse for any of these tickets? 
- I know that the one on South Main Street, I had put just one quarter in, because I was just going to get my BCI and there was 20 people in there waiting, so they were backed up. 
- I wanna show you something, so don't leave yet, okay? 
- Okay. 
- Okay, hold that. Okay, you're gonna help me out with these, okay? 
- Okay. 
- Alright, now I've got three choices and these are the three choices, I can charge your Mom number one is $50, right, and number two is $100 and number three is $150. So should I charge her number one, number two or number three? 
- Number one, Lenny. 
- Oh, no, no. You can't help her, I've gotta change it around now. Okay? 
- Okay. 
- So what do you think? 
- Number one. 
- Number one? Is that because your Mom helped you out? It is, huh? I think she cheated a little bit, what do you think? 
- Yes. 
- Oh, she thinks you cheated. Okay, well, I asked you to help me, so I'm gonna take your recommendation, it's gonna be $50, okay? 
- Okay. 
- [Frank] Alright, thanks for helping me out. 
- Thank you, Your Honor. 
- Alright.
