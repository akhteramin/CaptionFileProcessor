- Taste like? 
- It's actually really good! 
- Is it good? 
- I mean-
- 
- Does it taste like meat? (laughs) 
- Not really, more bourbon. 
- You know what-
- 
- Tastes like bourbon! 
- You really taste the bourbon-
- 
- So it's got bits of steak-
- 
- It's dominant. And bourbon is good. 
- Bits of steak. Swirled bourbon caramel-
- 
- Me likey! 
- Char seasoning in there, so if you like meat and if you like ice cream-
- 
- They have a little bacon on top as well. 
- It's a stupid thing, man! 
- And Ed, thank you for his marvelous t-shirt-
- 
- I love it! 
- Such a great gift. World war, win, repeat, America. 
- America. Come on, join us tomorrow-
- 
- Happy weekend! See you tomorrow! 
- We're gonna have a lot of fun. 
- See ya tomorrow! 
- [Woman] Get under the table, get under the table! 
- Oh (bleep)! 
- Oh, my God! 
- Oh, my God! 
- Oh, my God! 
- [Woman] Oh, my God! 
- It's happened again, California bracing with a second earthquake striking foundations and roads cracking, fires erupting and now the fear another one could be coming as California Governor Gavin Newsome declares a state of emergency in San Bernardino County. Welcome, everybody, happy weekend, I'm Neil Cavuto and you're looking live at Los Angeles International Airport, where all is calm right now after a second quake in as many days strikes north of the major city, near Ridgecrest, California where the first one epicentered. That's where you'll find our Jeff Paul, in the middle of it all. Jeff, how are things there now? 
- Yeah, Neil, I would say there's a general feeling of uneasiness. Two days, two big, massive earthquakes, right here, near this town in California and this latest one, a magnitude 7.1. It is followed by several aftershocks, within just the last few minutes or so while we were waiting to speak with you, we felt several of them out here at city hall. And that uneasiness is leading towards many people just not wanting to sleep inside their house last night. In fact, we caught up with one sheriff's deputy who told us, while they were out patrolling, going street-by-street to make sure people were okay and accounted for, he saw a lot of people either sleeping outside or coming here to city hall, where there is a shelter set up. Now I want to go to a moment here, maybe we can pull up the actual sound on this, this was the moment we were at a restaurant. We started to feel the rumbling, the violent shaking and this is what happened right after that, take a listen. 
- [Man] Go, go! 
- Get out! 
- Keep walkin', keep walkin'! 
- Everybody out. 
- Go, go! 
- Go, go! 
- Keep walkin'! 
- [Man] Come one, come on, go! 
- Yeah, you could really hear the panic on people's voices. This again, was a restaurant right here in Ridgecrest and there was a slight aftershock before this and everyone sort of, they'd been through a few of 'em in the last day. But then this next one, the 7.1, the whole building was shaking, dishes were crashing on the ground and you could see some of the people out there, just walking out in disbelief, some people hitting the ground, coming to tears. And shortly after walking out of this restaurant and collecting ourselves, we look off into the distance and we see a huge plume of smoke. We get closer and realize that this house is on fire and we do know that this is at least one house that was set on fire. A lot of these fires start because of ruptured gas lines. Incredibly, we're only hearing of some minor injuries due to broken glass or things falling on people, no reports of any deaths, but the governor here has declared a state of emergency and has requested a presidential declaration for some help out here from the Federal Government. So far, the President hasn't Tweeted about what's happened here lately in California. Neil. 
- All right, Jeff, thank you very, very much and as Jeff pointed out, the California Governor Gavin Newsome has already declared a state of emergency in at least San Bernardino County as officials assess the damage, brace for more. And that's what has everyone on tenterhooks, what kind of more does that mean? How much more, how significant? On the phone with us is Public Information Officer from California Governor's Office of Emergency Services, Bryan May. Bryan, thank you for taking the time. How are things looking there now? 
- [Bryan] Well, we've been working overnight since this second earthquake happened yesterday evening. Unfortunately for us, that second earthquake happened right before sunset, darkness prevented us from being able to do a lot of assessment overnight. We've just had sunrise here in California in the last hour or so, so right now is crucial for us, as we're getting into Ridgecrest and into the affected areas, to see what kind of damage we're talking about. Injuries, we've heard there are some, but we're not quite sure how much. And of course you heard of people who don't want to go inside their homes right now. We need to get in and see what the needs are so that we can meet those needs. 
- [Neil] Now blessedly, we've not heard any reports of significant injuries or worse, is that still the case? 
- [Bryan] Yeah, as of this morning, and we've been having briefings all night, we've had crews around the clock here in the emergency operations center just outside Sacramento, we haven't heard of any serious injuries. We do know that there are some, but not so much how serious the injuries are, so that's again, what we've gotta do this morning. We know there've been hospitals that were evacuated and as you saw, some of the power lines and gas lines that are been broken, so we've gotta get in there today and find out what we're dealing with. 
- [Neil] You know these aftershocks are more significant than the main event by a factor of up to 10 times and I'm wondering how unusual is that for Californians who are always braced for the possibility of this kind of stuff but not the follow up kind of stuff they've been seeing? 
- [Bryan] Yeah, and I'm gonna defer to the geologist that we've been working with, but in talking with them a lot over the last 48 hours, it's not that uncommon. And now what we're seeing is that the initial earthquake that we saw wasn't now considered the main earthquake, that was now called a foreshock because the bigger the earthquake, that becomes the main one. So now this 7.1, that happened yesterday evening, is the main earthquake and the one that we felt on the Fourth of July is now being called a foreshock. Again, not that uncommon if you talk to the geologists that cover these things. 
- [Neil] You know, Bryan, I'm just curious, we get these anecdotal reports, I don't know how rampant they are, a lot of folks afraid to sleep in their homes so they're sleeping out on their driveway or they're sleeping outside, they're that anxious. How widespread is that? 
- [Bryan] Well, and I haven't been (sighs) in Ridgecrest yet today, but I don't blame them. This has been goin' on for 48 hours now and the shaking has been very violent at times, so people wanna be outside where they feel at least a little bit safer. And the problem is, what we have learned is that we can't predict earthquakes, we can't predict when the next one's going to happen. We can try and give an advance warning, but in that case, even seconds is a good warning. If there's a train running through the area, we can slow the train down, maybe stop elevators, but we don't have a system that can predict, from minutes away, when an earthquake is going to happen. 
- Bryan, thank you for taking the time. I know you've probably had little, if any, sleep, so we appreciate your calling in and updating us. Bryan May with the Governor's Office of Emergency Services. Well, the President, by the way, was briefed on all of this, especially this morning with the updates on that 7.1 magnitude earthquake. Ellison Barber is right now with the President at Berkeley Heights, where the Commander in Chief is spending the weekend. Ellison. 
- Hey, Neil, yeah, the White House says that President Trump was briefed on the latest earthquake in California overnight. Around 1:00 a.m., the White House said that they had teams closely monitoring the situation there in California and said that they would be providing updates to the President throughout the night. President Trump is in New Jersey for the weekend, staying at his golf club in Bedminster and as of this morning, Tweeting about immigration, former Vice President Joe Biden and the economy. The Department of Labor says the U.S. economy added 224,000 jobs in June, that is up from 72,000 in May. 
- Our country continues to do really well, really, really well. So we're very happy about it, I think we're gonna be breaking records. If we had a Fed that would lower our interests rates, we'd be like a rocket ship. 
- President Trump continued those critiques of the Federal Reserve on Twitter late last night, writing, Other countries around the world are doing anything possible to take advantage of the United States, knowing that our Federal Reserve does not have a clue! He went on to Tweet that, The U.S.' most difficult problem is not our competitors, but the Federal Reserve. The President has come under fire for his attacks on the Federal Reserve and the chairman, Jerome Powell, for the last year. The President has pretty aggressively criticized and repeatedly gone after the Fed and the chairman. He's criticized the Fed for raising interest rates and in the President's view, not doing enough to help the U.S. economy. Jay Powell has emphasized that the Fed is independent and earlier this year, when asked about President Trump's frequent criticisms, Powell told reporters the Fed would never take political considerations into account or discuss them as part of their work. He said that their priority is working for the American people. Neil. 
- Ellison, thank you very, very much. Ellison Barber with the President in New Jersey. Meanwhile, with a strong jobs report like that, it is kinda tough to make the case that the economy is just tanking. So what do Democratic candidates do in light of this report? After this. [Music] I want it that way [Music] 
- I can't believe it. 
- That Carl brought his karaoke machine? [Music] Ain't nothin' but a heartache [Music] 
- No. [Music] Tell me why [Music] 
- I can't believe how easy it was to save hundreds of dollars on my car insurance with Geico. [Music] Tell me why [Music] [Music] I never wanna hear you say [Music] 
- [Scientist] No, Kevin! No, Kevin! No! 
- No, no! [Music] I want [Music] 
- [Announcer] Believe it, Geico could save you 15% or more on car insurance.

- Every time I smiled, I had to cover my mouth because I was so ashamed. When the denture slipped, I would have to excuse myself and go to the restroom, virtually in tears. It kept me from being able to speak properly. I could not eat corn, apples, baby back ribs. I did not want dentures to be part of my life. I pretty much decided dental implants were the route I was gonna take. 
- Let's do a head-to-head comparison of dental implants versus dentures. With dentures, the ability to taste food, to bite and chew is altered. The worst thing about dentures, bone loss. When you put an implant inside the bone, which is like the root of a tooth, now you've preserved the bone, it's a game changer. With implants, you walk into a restaurant, you order anything you want. You eat just like you have real teeth.

- And our economy is much better than it's ever been. From election day, we're over 50% increase and we've made trillions and trillions of dollars, with a T, trillions. 
- All right, that 50% increase to which the President was referring is the Dow Jones Industrial surging about that since he was first elected. The President saying he's a big reason for that and optimism ahead of his inauguration and what he's done since the inauguration have made the changes in a booming jobs report that few people saw coming. So for 2020 Democrats who are portraying an economy that isn't nearly as robust as the numbers seem to indicate, what do they do? All In Together CEO Lauren Leader is with us. We got Republican strategist Joseph Pinion and the host of Sincerely Kat on Fox Nation, Kat Timpf. Kat, end it with you, begin with you on what the President is saying, No denying the numbers, give me credit for those numbers. 
- Right, I think that's the second part that a lot of people have a problem with, right. The economy is doing very well, that's objectively true and this was a huge report in particular because it shows that this U.S.-China trade war hasn't really affected employment in this country negatively whatsoever. But at the same time-
- 
- Yet. But they all say yet. 
- Yet, yet. As we always say on this show, though, President Trump's approval rating should be much better, given how well the economy is doing. So I think with any other president it would be and it has been. We don't know how much it's going to affect things and then also at the same time, polls haven't always accurately represented just how much support the President has if you look back to 2016. So it's really, really hard to say, but it's gonna be hard for the Democrats because they can't say that the economy is a disaster, it's hard to argue against something that's doing so well. 
- Lauren, you couldn't say the economy is a disaster, right, let's say? 
- I just looked at this Gallup Poll that was taken a couple a couple of weeks ago and compared it to a year ago, which was independent of asking political questions, just asked Americans, How do you view the economy, great, good, poor? et cetera. 46% of Americans still think the economy is poor or very bad and that's basically the same number that it was a year ago. And that tells you-
- 
- How was it under Barack Obama? 
- Well, (sighs) I didn't look at every single year. I mean, I think, look, the confidence and it was a different time, obviously, because we were still coming out of a recession, out of the crisis, through most of the Obama presidency. The point is that I think Kat's right, it should look like a better picture than it feels and I think the impact of the tariffs on farmers in the Midwest, I think the ongoing wage growth is just now beginning to change, it's starting to rise slightly. But, you know, vast majorities of Americans couldn't manage a $200 unexpected medical or emergency. 
- But that's been the case through Democrat and Republican presidencies. 
- Well, I know, but the point is I think what the Democrats are gonna do is make a lot of hay out of that and say, Look, if the economy is so good, why aren't we investing back in the working class Americans? Why are we not working to reduce the debt? talk about the trillions with a T-
- 
- Democrats like-
- 
- I was gonna say-
- 
- Well-
- 
- Democrats lecturing on debt? 
- What Democrats have been-
- 
- Many have-
- 
- Talking about the debt? 
- Well, where is-
- 
- That's like me giving dietary advice. 
- It did-
- 
- But having said that-
- 
- Look at what they have-
- 
- It's a valid point. 
- To deal with! 
- All right, but-
- 
- The debt has exploded under this administration. 
- Well, it exploded-
- 
- I think they're gonna take it on. 
- Under the prior one. So any party lecturing the other on debt I think is a fool's game, but, Joseph, one of the things I do note is that the President hasn't really been able to take advantage of this, at least in polling to some of the points that were raised, is that there are one million more African-Americans employed than when Barack Obama left office, more than two million Hispanics than when Barack Obama left office. Yet with those groups, he's still under water, why is that? 
- I think that realistically, they've just done a bad job of messaging across the board. I think they're actually better served not makin' it about African-American employment or Hispanic employment, but just sayin' that, Look, we've got a problem with poverty in this country, but that problem pre-existed my administration. Having said that, if Democrats are tellin' ya that people are working two and three jobs, they've been working two or three jobs this whole time. The difference is, those two and three jobs are paying more money under my administration. 
- All right, well-
- 
- But, well-
- 
- It's one in 15 who are working two or more jobs. That's a high number nevertheless, but it is in this idea that everybody's working that. But I-
- 
- And wage growth, the wage growth is ticking up as the job growth is ticking up. Wage growth for African-Americans and Hispanics has not kept pace-
- 
- Well, for lower-
- 
- With the wage growth for the white Americans. 
- And middle income workers you're actually wrong on that. It's been running at close to a 3.3 to 3 1/2%-
- 
- [Lauren] And it's double that though for white Americans. 
- Well, no, no-
- 
- It is! 
- I mean. 
- I just looked at the numbers-
- 
- Before I walked on. 
- The fact of the matter is, I mean, for upper income, which tends to be a target of Democrats, it's been averaging closer to 3%. No, that's not narrowing the gap, but it is beginning to. So what I'm looking at with this is whether the arguments that Democrats are raising on the stump camp is gonna come back to bite them because most people look at this recovery would say, I can deal with this. 
- Right, absolutely and I think it's gonna be tough. I think that's why we've seen them focus on other things such as healthcare, that's a good thing, I think, for them to focus on because obviously Republicans had a chance to fix that and that got all messed up. That's didn't happen, they didn't have an answer-
- 
- How much of a role does-
- 
- to the problem. 
- The President himself play in this? I think he stomps on his own-
- 
- I absolutely-
- 
- otherwise good message? 
- I absolutely think-
- 
- Tweeting silly stuff, and he gets away. 
- He distracts from the message of the economy doing so well. Yes, he talks about it but then he'll Tweet something that's all the way out there or he'll go after somebody, call someone a loser and people tend to focus on those things more than-
- 
- Oh, I can see the Tweets-
- 
- They focus on the economy. 
- Coming on you right now. 
- I'm a loser, I already know I'm a loser, so what are ya gonna do? 
- All right, one other thing, Lauren, I look at when I look at all the data that comes in and you're right, we get a lot of it from a lot of angles, is that in the manufacturing states, some of the big ones like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Indiana, we are talking about wages growing at a faster clip than the rest of the nation. Yet, to your point, he is trailing, that is the President, by double digits in some of these, not quite that same amount in Indiana, but that doesn't jive with these numbers. 
- Well, because you have to look at the whole picture. Look, at the same time that we've had this sort of incremental growth in wages, which I don't deny, it's real and obviously the growth in jobs, you also have this explosion of student debt. So the access to the American dream has gotten more and more expensive, it's weighing down more families, not just the kids who are going to school, but their parents and their grandparents who are saddled with debt. You look at the rising cost of healthcare, the rising cost of housing, which the Democrats have just started talking about. The cost of living in almost every metropolitan area around the-
- 
- Would the government waving a wand to eradicate that debt, or to deal with Health Care For All, or to offer benefits to illegals-
- 
- Look, I-
- 
- Do you think that is enough to turn the tide for now or do other Americans look at that and say, Whoa, whoa, whoa, cool it. 
- Look, I think that the risk the President runs is this sense that he's tone deaf to the challenges that working-class and middle-class Americans are actually facing. He keeps talkin' about how amazing the stock market is, well, the vast majority of working-class folks aren't invested or benefiting from the stock market, except maybe for a 401k and those-
- 
- Well, 54% are you're right-
- 
- Okay, so then-
- there's another 46%-
- 
- It's down from 60%. 
- I mean, we could do the math. The point is, is that you continue to only-
- 
- But what about all these numbers I showed you on minority gains all of that? 
- You have to, all of the polls that ask Americans, or working-class Americans, how they feel, do they feel the sense that they are benefiting from this economy, the answer is no they do not-
- 
- So when the give-
- 
- Because of the-
- whole picture. 
- The President high marks on the economy, but overall, not for him, himself, what does that tell you, Joseph? 
- Right, and the Democrats have an opportunity there to say, And I have a solution for that. But, I mean, that's-
- 
- But it hasn't changed-
- 
- Part of why-
- 
- The view that the economy's doing well. 
- I think the reality is that the overwhelming majority of Americans do feel that the economy is going well. I think that if you look, again, not everyone is invested in the stock market, but it's gonna be very difficult for Democrats to say-
- 
- By the way, that masks the number who benefit from a higher market, or who see things in their pension funds that are directly, or indirectly invested. 
- Yeah, market confidence is very much an indicator on how the actual commercial impact and so I think if you just take a step back and say the realistic-
- 
- But that's dangerous, right? 
- [Lauren] It's huge, yes. 
- Constantly quoting the stock market. Ronald Reagan, of all people for whom the market boomed, was very leery. 
- It's extremely dangerous. 
- Look, I recognize the fact that, again, there are going to be people who says, I am not included in this growth, but I think it's going to be difficult for Democrats to stand up there and say, Your 401k goin' up is a figment of your imagination. The extra money-
- 
- But maybe her point-
- 
- You got back-
- 
- About those who will capitalize on the fact-
- 
- It's a small piece of it. 
- That they don't, maybe on these wedge issues and what you're doing on illegal immigrants and Health Care For All, will register, what do you think? 
- Well, I-
- 
- No, I'm saying it's a bigger picture than just the stock market. What their day-to-day lives are-
- 
- But you mention these examples as something that will eek out support where there isn't, maybe on the general economy. 
- Yeah, and look, the Democrats are gonna have a big stage for the next six months, to be dominating endless conversations about policy solutions for making American's lives better. They're gonna own that and the President is gonna eventually have to address-
- 
- But they're at a step-
- 
- What is he gonna do with-
- 
- With even Democratic voters who don't support giving health benefits to illegals. 
- I just think in a binary-
- 
- It's not presented-
- 
- Choice between somebody who didn't have a job yesterday and somebody who has a job tomorrow, they're not going to be able to convince them that somehow their life is worse off. I think that people, again, in polls early on are gonna be talkin' about the emotions, the visceral impact that Donald Trump's words has on their everyday life. But I think when you show up in November, when you start doing that polling, the actual only polling that matter, which is the exit polling, I think there's gonna be much different story. 
- So we're just wasting our time with the polls. 
- What are we gonna do-
- 
- I don't know? 
- For the next year? 
- I don't know. Guys, I'm gonna see ya soon again here. The President, he mentioned something, We've never seen this kind of strength before, then why, Mr. President, are you urging the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates? You don't need to if we're firing on all the cylinders. Or is there something I'm missing? Apparently there is, right after this. 
- Hey, who are you? 
- Oh, hey, Jeb, I'm a car thief. 
- What! 
- I'm here to steal your car because, well, that's my job. 
- What! 
- What? 
- What! 
- (laughs) What! 
- What! 
- What? 
- What!

- All right, getting our first images from California now. Shake, rattle and rolled, they're getting earthquake-related images from around Ridgecrest, California as the sun begins to rise there. This coming in, these images from KTTV. As you might have heard, a 7.1 magnitude earthquake in the region, higher by a factor 10 times than the one that hit just 24 hours earlier. We're watching this, no reports of any serious injuries or worse so far, so there is that. We'll keep ya posted on aftershocks and obviously a lot of Californians worried that they could see a lot more of those. In the meantime, the job market is stronger than all get out right now, in fact so strong, it has a lot of folks saying, Do we really even need to see the Federal Reserve cut interests rates to keep it going? And that lands the conundrum for stock traders because they sold off a little bit yesterday from record highs, we reached before July 4th, the holiday, on the notion that maybe there is no need to at least immediately cut rates. Let's get the view from Gibbs Wealth Management, Chief Investment Officer, Erin Gibbs, we've got FOX News Contributor Jonas Max Ferris and our very own FOX Business Network Deirdre Bolton. Deirdre, that was sort of the battle back and forth yesterday, wasn't it? Well, you know, it's strong and we like that, good news is good news, but it's bad news when it means the Federal Reserve might have to push off-
- 
- Yeah and if we look at-
- 
- A rate cut. 
- Fed funds futures, so what traders are anticipating, so it seems as if everyone, or most people, are still anticipating this cut in July, but the idea of a 50 basis point cut seems to be-
- 
- That's off the table now-
- 
- Really diminishing. Yeah, it's seems to be not even really a real possibility, but the 25 basis point is a possibility. But to your point, do we need at all and if so, do we need it now, those are the two outstanding questions. So the market clearly pricing it in, as far as what's coming, I'm gonna bet on the 25 basis point cut-
- 
- So we'll still see a cut? 
- I believe so. 
- [Neil] You think that, we're gonna still see a cut? 
- Yeah, because of really the last big piece of data that the Fed was getting was last Friday and because there were a few things that you weren't completely thrilled with-
- 
- Like what? 
- Well, for one, some of the wage growth started to drop and even though they-
- 
- Was it 3.1%? 
- Yeah, so just not quite as strong, so I think those kind of indicators. There's still a concern about trade war out there, I mean, we haven't gotten rid of it, we're just slowly moving forward. And also Europe, still, the last time they talked, the big issue was concerns about a global economic slowdown and we still have that out there, so though the U.S. is good. So I think a quarter point is still very much on the table for the end of July. 
- You know, I always wondered, Jonas, on this whether you go ahead and cut rates now, and in our environment, we have a strong economy, albeit maybe not as strong as we had, but you don't have a lot of arrows in the quiver so do you waste your time cutting 'em an environment as good as this when you might really need 'em down the road? 
- Yeah, it's like in that movie, The Fast and the Furious when he hit the nitrous too early and he's like, You ran outta nitrous! The reality-
- 
- I thought the exact same thing! Touche. 
- I think that's psychological Wizard of Oz kind of thing that the Fed does, it's very important in this. On just pure inflation terms, they could have lower interest rates, it would be good to have the interest rate curve be upward-slanting, so people aren't concerned we're gonna have a recession. That said, if they do that now and go to 1% or 1.5, and then we do get a recession-
- 
- [Neil] What are we now, around 2.5, is that it? 
- Yeah, a little under with the actual, anyway. 
- Yes. 
- If they do that, then people are gonna be like, wait a second, we're already recycling the QE money, we stopped doing that. We're already now down to 1%. We've already done tax cuts, we're not gonna get those again. We're already running a stimulus program, essentially increase spending. What are we gonna do now, a little panic, and the Fed wants to show off that they've got some tools. They really don't have that many tools left at this point, so they don't wanna-
- 
- It's quantitative easing and buying all the Treasury notes and bonds out there. That was kind of unprecedented when Bernanke was doing that, right. 
- Right, and they can't get out of it. I mean, they're trying to slowly, so slowly, let's let the interest payments be basically burned, that money. Instead they have to now go buy more longterm debt, which is one of the reasons longer term interest rates fell so much, besides these fears that are kinda irrational, that the economy's slowing, which kinda gets to the whole thing, What's going on is, you know, the market long term is earnings, economy, all that, but in the short run, there was a big bet going on that the economy's weakening enough to get the Fed to lower rates, but actually is not that weak, so we're gonna get a big boost in the stock market. That's what investors were hoping for and that story changed when this jobs numbers stood. 
- Well, when they say you can't lose, that a good report will be greeted favorably as a good report, a bad report would be greeted favorably as a reason for the Fed to ease, that sets you up for a disappointment. 
- That's the idea where you were saying that good news is bad news, bad news is good news. But I'm seeing more and more, I mean, when you talk about the tools, I think the Fed has also decided that by cutting rates or not cutting rates, that everyone understands in the market, whereas the QE was very difficult and there was a bit of hocus pocus. I mean, I'm sure there was a method-
- 
- Well, the President-
- 
- To the madness. 
- Was a critic of it. 
- Yes. 
- What was goin' on under Barack Obama-
- 
- But to me-
- 
- Now he says, Do that for me-
- 
- Right, do that. 
- And we'd be really off to the races. 
- Put that special sauce back in there, please. 
- Do think so, that that's the case? 
- Yeah, it's definitely something that could be added back in. But it's-
- 
- [Neil] Do you think we should add it back? 
- No, I think the tightening has been, because they just let it get so out of hand for so long and I think just small quarter-point rate cuts. I think the idea of when we were thinking about a 50-bip cut for the July meeting was a little aggressive. So I think the expectations now seem-
- 
- Yeah, and you more-
- 
- Much more rational. 
- And more general press talking even about deflationary worries, right. To your point, there were a lot of people saying, okay, maybe we don't need this now, but there were definite arguments being made in Washington Post, editorials in The Journal, The Economist, Bloomberg Business Week, you know, nobody's saying this is happening, but saying, okay, should this be, actually now what we're worried about? 
- I just wonder-
- 
- And you could slow down-
- 
- The trade thing, though. The trade thing holds everything in it. I always think we haven't gotten the impact of tariffs yet because a lot of them haven't reached consumers yet, because they were in transit and all that. So obviously, eventually that will happen, we don't know when, but if they get a trade deal, all bets are off, right? 
- You know the funny thing is that we do lower interest rates, or they keep going down, our weakening dollar would have the effect of more than the tariff, actually. So it would make all imports from all countries seem more than five, or 10, or 15% expense. In fact, I believe the President was talking about that by having rates too high, our dollar's too strong. So he wants to-
- 
- So you cut them. Weaken them, obviously it would improve-
- It would improve-
- 
- Right, 'cause-
- 
- Exporters getting-
- 
- Other countries-
- 
- Their goods out-
- 
- Yeah, people in Germany are very happy with our 2% 10-year bond because they have a zero or negative 10-year bond, so-
- 
- Yeah, in Germany, you're actually paying for the privilege to lend your money to the government. I mean, they have negative rates. 
- That's incredible, are we going there? 
- I don't see us going anywhere near negative rates. We're in a much healthier environment versus Europe. They're really struggling-
- 
- So are you bullish-
- 
- Just to get any growth. 
- At this stage? 
- Yeah, I think-
- 
- We are? 
- Yeah, we are, I'm bullish. But I'm cautious, let's say I'm-
- 
- Cautiously bullish. 
- Cautiously optimistic. 
- [Neil] Jonas? 
- We would probably be at about 1% if we did and there's two reasons. We have a stronger economy with stronger inflation than Europe, but we also borrow much more. We're in a huge, actual budget deficits that they don't run anymore. They're running a very strict, austere program, they're not borrowing as much as we are. 
- Yeah, it can boomerang on you. All right, guys, I know you'll be back. In the meantime, the battle between New York Democratic Congresswoman, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the border patrol, erupting over new allegations that this Facebook postings, that were pretty obnoxious, there might have been more of them than we thought and more involved in saying what they said.

- All right, President Trump just Tweeted this morning that, Democrats must change the loophole in asylum laws but they probably won't. They want open borders, which means massive crime and drugs! This as the border patrol is telling FOX News that it is looking into these recent allegations of agents, former agents, making controversial comments and more about lawmakers and illegal immigrants themselves in a second private Facebook group, and one that was taken down later than the first one. Anyway, it's a bit confusing. Let's get the read from the National Border Patrol Council President, back with us, Brandon Judd. Brandon, good to have you. 
- Thank you, I appreciate bein' on with you. 
- Do you know, Brandon, the latest wave of these Facebook postings that apparently involve more agents, and former agents, than the original roundup that was critical of illegals who are being held at these detention centers, and even those visiting detention centers? 
- I do, there's a couple Facebook pages that are out there. You've got the I'm 10-15, you've got the I'm 10-15x2, you've got The Real CBP Nation. All of these Facebook pages have been critical of illegal aliens, they've been critical of certain lawmakers. Now there's some things that have been posted on those Facebook pages that are perfectly fine, they're political talk and you can actually do that. But there's other things that are absolutely reprehensible and I'm aware that there's been about 13 letters that have been sent out to current employees that are cease and desist letters, telling them that they need to stop their Facebook posts and that's just the initial. Now the investigation has to go into, were these posts of the nature that violates policy? And if they were, those individuals will be held accountable and they need to be held accountable. 
- When you say, held accountable, fired? 
- It could be, it strictly depends on what the nature of the posts were. I mean, if they're bad enough, if they're releasing information about law enforcement, sensitive information, they're gonna be very, very strict sanctions-
- 
- What if they were-
- 
- And yes, they could be. 
- Just disparaging, or sometimes deemed, racist, comments? Would you-
- 
- Oh, there-
- 
- Would you fire them for that? 
- Yes, if they're racist comments, absolutely. We cannot, as uniformed law enforcement, we cannot show that we have a bias. If we have a bias, then you cannot properly enforce the laws. There is no place in law enforcement for individuals that are racist. There's no place in law enforcement for people that hate other groups of people because you obviously cannot enforce the laws properly if you're already bringing that bias into the workplace. 
- You know, Brandon, the reason why I asked that is Senator Chuck Schumer had called for the firing of Mark Morgan on all this, the acting commissioner of the Customs and Border Protection-
- 
- That's wrong. 
- Ultimately picked to lead the agency because of what was happening under him, what do you think? 
- No, that's absolutely wrong. In fact, Commissioner Morgan, I can tell ya that when he was the chief of the Border Patrol, he was made aware of just one post and he immediately took action and he took the most severe action that he possibly could have taken under labor laws at that time. So Commissioner Morgan, currently Commissioner Morgan, he did what he needed to do. What's funny is Senator Schumer called for his termination before he was even the commissioner. I mean, he's over at ICE, he was the director of ICE and Senator Schumer is calling for his termination when he's not even the commissioner. Senator Schumer has it completely and totally wrong. He needs to look deeper and he needs to look at the people that have been here for an awful-long time that should have been aware of this and should have been taking proper action. 
- You know, I don't know where the truth starts or the exaggerations begin on these Facebook postings, but one of the things that Politico and others have reported, Brandon, is that higher ups were aware of this, they weren't proud of it, but they were aware. Do you know anything about any of this? 
- They absolutely were aware of this. CBP is required to monitor what agents are doing, whether it's on duty, off duty. These Facebook pages, they were aware of these pages, I mean, you had a great-
- 
- And did they tell them to take them down? Or did they take it down? 
- No, no they didn't. In fact, if you look at these Facebook pages, there were a great many high-level managers that were on these pages. So yes, they were absolutely aware of it, they did have a responsibility to do something about it and they didn't. Again, I'm gonna point back to 2017, almost two years to the date, the National Border Patrol Council sent out an advisory to agents telling them, You need to be careful about what you're posting on Facebook. There are certain things that you can post, but there are certain things that are absolutely inappropriate and could potentially affect your job status. And CBP didn't follow up. I mean, if you look at the Facebook posts, the National Border Patrol Council, we were the first ones to come out and condemn those posts when the ProPublica article broke. The agency came in later after us and this is what happens on a very regular basis and frankly, it's very frustrating to us. We want the most honorable organization that we can have. This agency is a very important agency, the work that we do is extremely important for the American public. We are charged with securing the border and we have to do it properly and have to have the right agents to do it. 
- Brandon, we'll watch closely, thank you for taking the time. Brandon Judd, the National Border Patrol Council President, joining us out of Salt Lake City. Thank you, sir. 
- Thank you. 
- Meanwhile, I want to show you what's happening in California right now. This is Ridgecrest. Thankfully, no reports of significant injuries, but as you can see, there were structure fires as a result of gas leaks throughout the city. The state's emergency services director leaving the door open for the possibility that still more serious damage as daylight emerges and they're able to reassess all of this in the wake of a 7.1 magnitude follow up earthquake, after a 6.4 magnitude earthquake just the day before. That is technically 10 times more serious. More after this.

- All right, we try to be very fair and balanced here. We just heard from the border patrol unity, Brandon Judd, now to a border state Democrat who isn't impressed with what he's been hearing out of border officials. Texas Democratic Congressman Al Green. Congressman, very good to have you. 
- Good to be with you, Mr. Cavuto. 
- Neil, please, you're the congressman, the big cheese here, not me. 
- (laughs) You're kind. You're kind. 
- So let me get your take on what Brandon Judd was just saying, sir, that if he finds that people have made, in fact, these obnoxious comments, border agents have been charged with making on these Facebook posts, since taken down, he would advocate firing them. Is that good enough for you? 
- Yes, it is good enough. I'm sure there are other things that can be done, as well, but if a person exhibits racial views that are abhorrent, racism as it was called by the agent, by the way, I commend him, I think that it is appropriate to consider terminating the relationship. 
- This measure that was overwhelmingly approved in Congress, the $4.6 billion funding to deal with the crisis at the border, did you vote for that? 
- I did. 
- And you did so to ease the congestion and the problems with the kids and everyone else, right? 
- Well, I did so for a multiplicity of reasons and I understand why those who did not do so. I did so because, quite frankly, I've been talkin' for some time about the conditions at the border. I went there, I saw the conditions and I wanted to do what I could, in my own way, to be helpful. But I understand that those who chose not too, to, in a sense, highlight the fact that there needs to be more transparency, there needs to be more accountability. I respect what they did. For me, seeing that baby with her father on the shores of the river, that touched my heart in a way such that it was impossible for me to vote otherwise. 
- You know, as you've pointed out, Congressman, these children popping up in these migrant centers is quintuple what it was under Barack Obama, under whom these facilities were built in the first place, but not prepared for the crowds that fill these facilities today. So is this really the agent's fault, or for that matter even Homeland Security? 
- Mr. Cavuto, I thank you for asking the question because it's a question that really merits an answer. The question is this, are we there to facilitate the law, or are we there to deter people from coming into the country? In the early part of the 19th century, we were processing five to 10,000 people per day. We never separated children from their parents. Persons were fleeing Scandinavia and Eastern Europe and they came by the millions and we processed them. The question is, do we really want to process people, if we do, we can, or do we want to find the means by which we can deter them from coming? 
- But you would have to admit to the-
- 
- I believe-
- 
- You would have to admit that these numbers are staggering, even dwarfing what Barack Obama was dealing with when he, too, would look into briefly separating kids from families just to make sure that those with whom they were traveling were in fact, that they're related. 
- Well, compared to those who were comin' through Ellis Island, they are not dwarfing numbers, especially given-
- 
- But this isn't Ellis Island. 
- They didn't have-
- 
- This is right at our border. 
- The computer equipment that we have currently. 
- This is a very different case, right here, right there, right now. So do you think-
- 
- Well, Ellis Island-
- 
- That the $4.6 billion that's been allocated to deal with this, would you be happy if it's still the same folks in charge of this, or do you want someone else running it? 
- Well, let me continue, I have to say this and I'll answer your question. But those who were coming through Ellis Island were right there, right then and we respected them and we welcomed them. There seems to be a removal of the welcome mat for those who are coming from-
- 
- No, no, no, no-
- 
- South of the border. 
- We welcomed them because they had assurances that there were family or friends who take them in, who could take care of them and not the United States government, very different environment. 
- Well, a good many of them did not, Mr. Cavuto, and by the way, a good many of the people who were coming from south of the border, they have family, friends and persons who can assist them, as well, but we are turning them away without even giving them an interview to a certain extent now, by pushing the interview process to Mexico. And now, to your question about whether or not the persons who are in charge are the persons who should remain in charge, it's my opinion that persons who are in charge, some of them are victims themselves because they are forced to enforce policies that, quite frankly, are abhorrent. A policy of separating children from their parents, no country should have such a policy and we should-
- 
- Well, you can understand-
- 
- Not be proud of this. 
- Why it happens, though. I mean, in the cases where-
- 
- No, I cannot. 
- All right, so-
- 
- I cannot. 
- When Barack Obama was entertaining that because he simply didn't know where a lot of these kids were coming from, now he didn't formally separate them for extended periods of time, but he recognized that some of them were being used as leverage to get into this country. 
- Among any group of folk, you'll have some things that are not appropriate, but the overwhelming majority of these people are coming here to escape persecution, escape crime. I just returned from El Salvador. I went there to bring back a constituent who had been deported and we brought him home. He had a 10-year bar on him, a Mr. Escobar, he was married to an American woman, he had two American-born children, he reported to ICE and he was deported with the money in his pocket and the clothes on his back. We brought him home. So I think it's the attitude that we have to deal with, Mr. Cavuto. I really do and listen, let me thank you for giving me the opportunity to say that because quite frankly, we are finding that it's difficult to get that message out and I appreciate it. 
- Well, no, I appreciate you're coming on, Congressman. That commercial, unfortunately, won't stop for love or money but I want to thank you. Al Green of Texas. 
- Thank you, sir. Much more after this. [Music] Can I put in a request [Music] [Music] Don't have no sense about this [Music] [Music] Can't take no cuss about this [Music] [Music] Like this [Music]

- Yeah, Neil, and this earthquake was felt far and wide. I mean, we're right here, the closest city near the epicenter of this magnitude 7.1 earthquake, but there are reports of people as far north as Sacramento, as far east as Phoenix, Arizona and as far south as Mexico, feeling some sort of rumbling due to this particular earthquake that happened just after eight o'clock local time. Now as you take a look at some of this video here, this is some video that my producer shot as we were out grabbin' a bite to eat, or at least trying to. There was first a smaller aftershock that was just minor, but then a few minutes later, that's when that 7.1 magnitude earthquake rumbled through. Yeah, you can hear the things crashing in the restaurant, you could hear people screaming as they tried to take cover, or find some safety. And then shortly after that, if you sorta got your wits about you, we started hearing the sirens, police going in every direction, ambulances trying to respond to the flurry of calls that they got after this huge earthquake. And then we saw fire off into the distance and we know of at least one structure that was destroyed, we've heard about a few other fires caused likely due to gas lines ruptures. And a big part of that, because of those fires and because of the uneasiness from residents, some are choosing to sleep outside and they slept outside last night. We just caught up with one resident, we asked her how she's gonna be, sort of, living her life moving forward, take a listen. 
- If it happens, it happens. But I'm not gonna sit around and wait for it and not do anything, I can't do that. I've sat on the bench in our picnic area for two nights now, I'm not gonna do that. I'm just gonna get on with life and if it hits, it hits. There's nothin' I can do to stop it, there's nothin' I can do to forewarn me, so I just gotta keep busy so I don't think about it. 
- And, Neil, experts warn there will be more aftershocks and there is a chance there could be an even bigger earthquake on the way. Neil. 
- Jeff Paul, thank you, my friend, be safe yourself. Jeff Paul in the middle of all of that. By the way, we're keeping an eye on Iran, it's already threatened to retaliate over one of its tankers seized by the British. It's warning that it's prepared to seize a British tanker. Then what?

- All right, fast-moving developments on Iran right now. It is demanding the United Kingdom release the oil tanker it seized from Iran, it's right now, I believe in Gibraltar. This, as Iran says, it will not negotiate with the U.S. until sanctions are lifted. With us is a former USS Cole Commander Kirk Lippold and, Commander, when it rains, it pours. We understand that the President just got off the phone with Theresa May of Britain, the soon-to-be outgoing prime minister of Britain, saying that, The two countries are closely coordinating responses to whatever Iran is planning and pushing for the full denuclearization, separately, of North Korea, but obviously, in contact as to judge what happens next. You know this region very, very well and you know what the Iranians might be considering, they're not adverse to seizing personnel in the region, as they did back in 2007, when they stormed a British frigate and, I believe, held about a dozen men and women captive for a while before releasing them. So they're up to that and they're apparently itching to do that, or the same kinda thing. What do you think? 
- Well, I think, Neil, it's a significant development in the fact that the British decided to seize this tanker. Clearly, it was in violation, not just of U.S. sanctions, but more importantly, EU sanctions, with that oil headed towards Syria. That oil tanker carries two million barrels of oil, which equates to about 84 million gallons, that was huge for the Syrian regime to be able to support itself, and the fact that that's been cut off is good. What Iran does next? I think they should choose very wisely because they do not want to accidentally start something that they may not be able to stop or control. 
- All right, we understand, I might have misspoke, Commander, that this conversation between the President and Theresa May was actually yesterday, the details about it are only coming to light today. But they did talk about shared interests in enforcing sanctions on Syria to ensure Iran doesn't obtain a nuclear weapon. But with the Iranians ready to exceed the uranium production that would make such a thing more likely. They're not payin' attention. 
- Well, when you look at it, Iran is getting squeezed much quicker and much harsher than they anticipated when President Trump put these sanctions back into place. If they in fact break the cap that they claim that they have with respect to the amount they're allowed to have for enriched uranium, they're in violation of the agreement. That now moves things into a whole different category and as a letter written yesterday by Senators Cruz and Rubio, and I believe one other, they're looking and saying, now that they violate that agreement, we're now into the UN category where the snapback sanctions can in fact come into place. This is now engaging the whole world because Iran is not just against the U.S. at this point, now they're against the world. And when Iran is doing that, they're gonna find themselves increasingly isolated, not just from the U.S., but also our European allies are going to begin to realize that they need to not only support the U.S., but more importantly support the UN in what we're doing to ensure that Iran never develops that nuclear weapons capability. 
- In the meantime, everyone's waiting to see what they do in response to this UK vessel move. I was mentioning in 2007, seizing a vessel that the Iranians claim was not in international waters but their waters, but when it comes to the Strait of Hormuz, or almost anything wet nearby Iran, (laughs) they declare that as their land or their waters. So how do you, even argue for what are internationally-recognized standards, 12 miles from a country's shore is everybody's water. 
- Well, it's a international waterway, it's recognized under international law. While the Iranians may make that claim, it has absolutely no weight when it comes to that international standard. So people are going to be able to continue to transit that waterway and if Iran does interfere with it, then the international community at that point, has an obligation to do whatever it takes, diplomatically, economically and if necessarily, militarily to ensure that the waterway stays open for the pre-transit of oil out of the Middle East to keep the world's economies going. 
- Commander, thank you very, very much, good chatting with you again. 
- As always, Neil, thank you. 
- All right, in the meantime, we have not forgotten about the 2020 presidential race, a lot of Democrats are already knee-deep in fundraising and a lot of them knee-deep in cash. Who has the most? It's a little early in the process, but never too early to start picking through the numbers and what they might mean. To do that, Gillian Turner in Washington with the latest. Hey, Gillian. 
- Hey, good morning, Neil. So the competition for funds, as you said, is stiff this election cycle and it got even tighter among the top-tier Democrats during the second quarter of this year, according to the new numbers. Candidates are on deadline to report Q2 to the FEC by July 15th, but most made it in under the gun. Let's take a look. So far, Pete Buttigieg comes in tops at $24.8 million in haul. Joe Biden up next with $21.5 million. Then Bernie Sanders with $18 million, followed by Kamala Harris with $12 million. After Harris, though, the drop-off's pretty steep. Michael Bennet comes in next with a $2.8 million haul and says, He's feelin' the heat. 
- I haven't been running for president for a long time, I just got in the race. So what I'm concerned about is making sure that we continue to raise the resources we need to be able to be competitive in the early states of Iowa and New Hampshire. 
- So these numbers matter, Neil, because the candidates will all need every dollar they can get in order to make it to round two, the next Democratic debate's comin' up soon. The other thing, the number that matters a lot here, popularity, Biden's still 10 points out ahead of his Democratic colleagues, even after falling a little bit in the polls after the last debate last week. Neil. 
- Gillian, thank you very, very much. We are keeping track-
- 
- You bet. 
- Of where the candidates are going to be today. For example, Joe Biden, we understand, is going to be spending a good chunk of time in South Carolina, consider a must-win for him to stabilize a campaign that's been buffeted lately. Republican South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, joining us right now. Senator, good to have you. 
- Good morning, Neil, good to be back with you. 
- Joe Biden's going to be in your beautiful state today. He has talked to the press since of course that debate where he's been sort of universally panned, that he can right the ship, he's looking forward, not looking backward, how does he look in your state on the Democratic side? 
- You know, from my friends on the left, they tell me that he's still their preferred choice because their goal is to find the candidate that they think will be the most competitive against our President Trump. The fact is that I think their goal of keeping Biden as a front runner is an important one for them, but Kamala Harris is creeping up. African-American voters are the majority in the Democrat primary and therefore her performance against Joe Biden, especially on a racial issue like busing, has prompted more folks to start taking a second look at her and she is now gaining within the state. She has been behind in the African-American community, which has been quite unusual and interesting. Joe Biden's legacy as the first vice president of the first African-American president has served him well. But those numbers are startin' to show a lot of cracks. 
- You know, as you've reminded in the past, Senator, I just thought you were talking book about South Carolina in your pride of being the senator there, but it has really turned a lot of races in the past, hasn't it? It was there that George Bush put John McCain's surge to bed and he went on, ultimately, to win the Republican nomination in 2000, putting him aside in South Carolina. We saw something very, very similar with Barack Obama, an African-American who had to win in that state and did, handily over Hilary Clinton on his route for the nomination at the time. I'm wondering if it will play a similar role this go round? 
- I think so, I call it the miracle of the mo. Momentum is a huge factor in politics and the first in the South primary state, South Carolina, has proven to be the springboard to presidential success on the right as well as the left. I think since 1980, South Carolinians have chosen the right president on the Republican side all times except for one time. On the Democrat side, they've had a lot of success, as well. I think South Carolina is poised to make the decision for the Democrats this cycle. It'll be interesting to see who they choose. I still think we're a long way, of course, away from 2020, but it'll be very interesting to see who will stand toe-to-toe with President Trump. I like our odds right now, by the way. I think we're in a very good position, the economy's strong, our international relationships are getting stronger, our president was very presidential on Fourth of July. There's no doubt that when you look at the 2020 election, it's gonna be a strong, powerful matchup, but right now, I'm pretty excited about where we are. 
- You know, Senator, it's very early and you remind me it's very early so don't get fixated on polls, but are you surprised, given the strength of the economy, given the unexpected 224,000 job surge in the latest month and all the good things that go with that including markets in and out of all-time highs, that the President isn't benefiting more from that? What do you think is happening? 
- Well, we're in a very polarized place from a political perspective, called America. It has been challenging for a very long time, it's been getting worse, incrementally. There's no doubt that we've had a lot of distractions from what should be, as the old saying goes, The economy, stupid. If we focus our attention on the economic progress that we've made, especially in the most fragile, economic Americans, we would be celebrating. Six million jobs created since the tax reform, half of those jobs have been occupied by African-Americans and Hispanics. We have a lot to celebrate, but there have been so many distractions durin' this cycle that if we start focusing on the reality of what matters to the average American, how much more money am I taking home, what is my likelihood for success in this economy, can my kids expect a better America than I? The answer is consistently yes. The numbers bear that out, but the narrative that we hear consistently has nothing to do with the reality, it has to do with the rhetoric of Washington. That is, unfortunately, distracting a lot of Americans from what is, in fact, the greatest economy we've seen in more than three decades. We've seen more progress in race relations, even right now I make this statement, more progress in race relations, more firsts than we've ever seen. We should be excited to be Americans and we should be excited to be Americans right now in 2019. There's so many distractions trying to divide us because if we stand united, we win, if are divided, we are in jeopardy. I think we're gonna get our act together and I think the left has been selling a rhetoric as if it were reality. We're gonna be able to discern the difference and create the contrast so that the average American, whether they vote for Republicans or not, that's not the question, is America better off under the conservative principles and policies put in place? The answer is resoundingly, yes. 
- But do you think the President risked torpedoing that, Senator, by this ongoing trade riff with China? Now tariffs have really not had a chance to kick in since so many goods were already on store shelves. I believe they were going to kick in when stuff, mid-shipment, would get to the United States. So the real impact of that hasn't been felt and the President argues that he likes tariffs anyway, that a lot of money is coming in. But average Americans pay those tariffs and I'm wondering if you feel he's out of step with that, or out of sync with that, and it's gonna cost him? 
- Well, I like to break the tariff conversation down into multiple categories. When you think about China, China's goal is to steal the future, which would imperil American progress. President Trump's approach with China is a necessary altercation so that we can restore confidence in our workforce and create the best future going forward from a technological standpoint. The goal for their IP theft is simply to steal the future of work. We're not gonna let that happen. 
- So tariffs are worth it-
- 
- I applaud-
- 
- In that regard to you? 
- The President's approach. 
- You agree with the President's tariffs are worth it to send that message, but do you think tariffs are a good thing, period, that if-
- 
- No, no-
- 
- If this isn't settled, it's gonna boomerang on Republicans? 
- No question, there's no doubt that today, if you look at the six or seven states that you were talking about earlier in the show, the wage gains in those states that tariffs get put in jeopardy, their wage growths have outstripped the wage growths that we're celebrating at 3.1%. Some states have had four, five, 6% wage growth, that's exciting news, especially in those sectors, but the truth is that the overall tariff conversation is not in the best interest of Americans, without any question. I put the asterisk out there for China, because it's a very different conversation we're having. We're using tariffs in trade as a means of resetting tectonic shift in the plates on our relationships. But when you think about the USMCA, when you think about Europe, we have to make sure that we don't go too far. The 232 auto tariffs is a classic example, where I have pushed back, because I think they create headwinds throughout the South. 
- Senator, it's always a pleasure catching up with you, be well. 
- Thank you, sir. 
- All right, Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, joining us out of Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. We mentioned the President, he says he's looking into using an executive order to get that citizenship question back on the 2020 Census. Now forget about your politics, is that even legal? After this.

- [Announcer] Thankfully, Wounded Warrior Project was there for support. 
- One of the first events with Wounded Warrior Project that I was involved with, I met my future wife. The first time she was over at the house, she saw my walker and she said, Hey, do you use that? I said, If we ever get to the point where we're gonna get married, I'll be on my feet, I promise you that. 
- When he told me he was gonna walk down the aisle, it made me feel special and flattered. I just knew I was gonna marry him. 
- I had to work as hard as I could for as long as I had to in order to make that happen. I'm so thankful for Wounded Warrior Project for getting me where I could meet my future wife and walk down the aisle for her. Gave me a life worth living. 
- Being detected was not an option. If I was recognized, the whole operation was blown. The element of surprise was imperative.

- [Soldier] Woo, Maui! 
- Boom! 
- [Announcer] Navy Federal Credit Union, our members are the mission. 
- [Reporter] Are you going to issue an executive order on the census? 
- We're thinking about doing that, it's one of the ways. We have four or five ways we can do it. We can also add an addition on so we can start the printing now and maybe do an addendum after we get a positive decision. So we're working on a lot of things, including an executive order. 
- All right, the President says he's looking into ways of adding that citizenship question after all to the census, including, as he said there, an executive order. Would that hold up in court? It's not quite that black and white, but who better to pick it apart than attorney extraordinaire, Mercedes Colwin. 
- Hi, Neil. 
- So as I understand, Mercedes, the Supreme Court didn't reject the argument as much as say the administration, through the Commerce Department, didn't give it a compelling enough case, right? 
- And didn't really give the explanation. So I'm going to step back to 2013 because they had a similar case regarding the Voting Rights Act. It had nothing to do with the census or the citizenship issue, but it had to do with that law. Chief Justice Roberts, who was the Chief Judge then, said we're gonna step away. The federal government's gonna step away and let the states deal with the electoral process, they can do the legislation at the local level. So basically, the governance on the Federal's part, step back. Now 2019, now the federal government steps in and says, hey, we want to help with respect to the Voting Rights Act, which what it did was, made sure that the individuals could vote, regardless of discrimination. If you go back decades ago, that's where it germinated. It started with allowing individuals to vote, regardless of their race. Well now, so the Chief Judge Roberts says, why are you going back to the Voting Rights Act, which we already ruled in 2013, let the states deal with it, why is the Federal government stepping in now in 2019 and say, well, we're going to assist in the promulgation of the Voting Rights Act, make sure that it's enforced properly, make sure that there's no discrimination, make sure that the districts that have a high number of individuals that are of color or have the appropriate numbers of representation in Congress, when we've already ruled that the states can deal with this? 
- So what kind-
- 
- So that's-
- 
- Of compelling argument-
- 
- The difference on this. 
- Do they need to make to win over this particular judge, who has to be won over? 
- Sure, frankly, just step forward and say, look, we wanna look at the districting. Just come straight out and say, It's not so much discrimination because we know, Chief Judge, that your ruled on letting the local government deal with this in 2013, we're looking to make sure that there's appropriate levels of representation. So if their districts, and this is what a lot of the DOJ members have been writing about in these op-eds, have said, Why don't you just come forward and say hey, we might need this. We might need greater numbers of representation, but in order for there to be greater numbers of representation in Congress or less, we need to know how many U.S. citizens are in particular jurisdictions around the country. 
- So why wasn't there a tenth the fuss when the question was taken out? 'Cause it used to be a staple in the census then it was taken out under the Obama administration. I don't remember anyone saying boo then, so why is it a big deal putting it back in? 
- Well, I think what Chief Judge wanted, someone to come forward and say, hey, it was about districting and yes, we're gonna talk not only about the districting issue and how much, it's also the infrastructure. You've got $980 billion that-
- 
- So they're thinking-
- 
- You're going to give-
- 
- There might be something-
- 
- Around the country. 
- Sinister afoot here and they wanna prove or disprove that. 
- Exactly, especially in the history of the Voting Rights Act back in 2013. I think-
- 
- That's interesting. 
- If you've got the same Chief Judge, so he's looking and saying-
- 
- I didn't know that. 
- Just come forward. Can I say a quick hi to my mom? She's watching, hi, Roslyn! Love ya, Mom! 
- That's nice. Was it, Roslyn, she's a very smart woman. 
- Roslyn Stern, she's amazing! 
- She is, indeed. All right, Mercedes, thank you very, very much. Tom Homan, the former acting ICE Director, his read on all of this and what this means if the President can't get that question in. After this.

- All right, we've Tom Homan here, the former acting ICE director, he's gonna talk about this push the administration has to go through with these deportations, more on that in a sec. But I did wanna give Tom a chance to respond to what Mercedes Colwin was talking about regarding of this question in the census that the administration wants to push by executive order to make sure you can still ask are you a legal citizen of the United States. Where do you think this is going, Tom? 
- Well, I hope the administration succeeds in it for a couple of reasons. Number one, don't we wanna know how many illegal aliens are in the United States? I mean, if they're talking about immigration reform, free medical care, pathways to citizenship for people here illegally for a while, don't we wanna know what that population is? I think that'd be the basis of makin' some of these decisions. And second of all, I don't think representation in the House of Representatives, or the Electoral College that elects our president, should be based on people who are here illegally. So I think it's good for a couple of reasons. 
- So, let me switch gears a little bit here. Regardless of how that works, the administration still says it's going to pursue these deportations, legal deportations, the kind that went under Barack Obama in cases already adjudicated and judged, All right, you have to go back to Mexico, or Honduras, or Guatemala, wherever, and it's going to start soon, the President didn't indicate how soon. How do you think that's going to go? 
- Look, it's going to be controversial, but I think it needs to be done. It's not a question should it be done, it has to be done. And as you said, Neil, I did this when I was the executive associate director at ICE. I ran a national operation called Operation Border Guarding back in 2015, when we went and sought out those who had final orders, specifically family units, and we arrested some family units, had final orders by an immigration judge, we put 'em on airplanes and sent 'em home and the borders numbers went down because we showed there's a consequence to deterrence. If a final order by an immigration judge, after due process, doesn't mean anything, then there's no integrity in the system, just open the border up and let everybody in because there's no consequence anymore, there's no law, there's no rule governing who can come in, who can come into the United States legally. 
- Tom, what do you do for the illegals here and protected in sanctuary cities, towns, or states? They're gonna do everything in their power, these cities, towns, or states to makes sure that the Feds can't get in there. 
- Well, they're not gonna stops the Feds from doin' their job. Look, they can not assist, which they've done, or they do what the Oakland mayor did and give 'em a heads up, ICE is in town, but the men and women-
- 
- But that's illegal-
- 
- Who are in ICE are gonna do their job. 
- The head's up is an illegal act, right? 
- Not only that, but you know you had a congressman the other day, Ocasio-Cortez talkin' about how people should take 'em into their homes. Look, aiding and abetting, harboring an illegal alien's a felony, so you know, ICE is goin' to take this seriously. These people've had their due process at great tax payer expense. They've been ordered by a judge to go home and if you and I can ignore a judge's order, what would happen to us, Neil? This has to be done. As controversial as it is, if we don't do it, then we might as well just blow the whole system up and open the border up, because we have no security, we have no sovereignty, we have no rule over all the country anymore. If people wanna step in the way of ICE, then look for further action from ICE. It's a crime to impede federal law enforcement officers. 
- The law's on your side in this case, Tom, there's no doubt about that, but of course, images can play havoc in the middle of this. The reason why I'm thinkin', I'm old enough to remember the Elian Gonzalez case when he was seized from a home and ultimately sent back to Cuba. And was those images, legal as they were to retrieve him, that stuck in American's heads during the Clinton administration. That's going to be inevitable, the images of ICE agents, rammin' on doors to try to get people, say, All right, you're arrested, you have to go back, how is that all gonna go down? 
- Well, look, to those people who are gonna push that message, I think you need to ask 'em a question, What is your option? What do you wanna do? Because if there's no integrity in the system, if people can come here to the Unites States, they can enter illegally and get to stay forever 'cause we're not brave enough to enforce the law, that's gonna send a bad message to the rest of the world, come here, violate our laws, the facilities will still be overcrowded. If the message we wanna send to the rest of the world is, come here with a child, you can even have due process at great tax payer expense, billions of dollars, and when the Federal judge orders you removed, you don't have to leave because it's uncomfortable to arrest you and make you leave, then we're never gonna solve the border crisis. And this isn't just about enforcin' the law, Neil, this is about saving lives. Children are dying entering this country, 31% of women are being raped. We gotta send the message, it's not okay, and we're bankrollin' criminal organizations that are smuggling these people. It's just not about enforcin' laws, it's about saving lives and takin' money out of criminal organizations' hands. It's the right thing to do, as sad, as unfortunate, sometimes enforcin' law is, it doesn't mean we ignore it. 
- I'd be remiss if I didn't mention these Facebook postings of a present, maybe former, CBP workers who had disparaging comments they made about those who they were protecting at these facilities, towards those who visited them. Do you believe, it's proven, that many of them said the things they were alleged to have said, that they should be terminated? 
- I wanna wait and see what the investigation shows, but I've been told that, from my sources, there's only several people that posted things to that extreme. And of course, they need to be dealt with, that's not the border patrol I know and I think it distracts from the fine work the border patrols are doin'. But I'll say this, at what point, when you go to work every day, you're being called a Nazi, a racist, that you're makin' women drink outta toilets, which is total crap, and when you go to work and you hear these things, you get beaten down every day, you get pushed in the corner every day, at what point does your spirit get broken, you may do some things that you probably shouldn't have done? I'm not makin' excuses for anybody, but these men and women of the border patrol, they're doin' a great job in a very difficult circumstances and the vast, vast majority of 'em are doin' the right thing for their nation, and if a few people step outta line, they should be dealt with absolutely.

- [Chris] They're gonna come after you. 
- [Joe] Sure they're gonna come after me. 
- We're you prepared for them you to come after you? 
- I was prepared for them to come after me but I wasn't prepared for the person coming at me the way she came at. 
- All right, Joe Biden trying to explain his awful performance in that debate and Kamala Harris going too far too quickly, especially raising a busing issue that goes back to the 1970s. Now his supporters are questioning, if he wasn't prepared for that, is he prepared for the job of President of the United States at all? All In Together CEO Lauren Leader back with us, Republican strategist Joseph Pinon and the host of Sincerely Kat on FOX Nation, Kat Timf. So, Lauren, let me ask you, it just seems like a lot of excuse making here. 
- (sighs) You know, you ask two questions, Is he prepared to be president? and I think he certainly is incredibly qualified, but that's not how you get to be president. I mean the fact is that there are 25 candidates that are gonna come after him. Sitting at the top of the polls is actually not a great place to be this early on because it opens up a million doors to scrutinize every piece of his record. And look, younger voters are paying very close attention to this, younger voters and women, particularly, are really watching to ask-
- 
- [Neil] Has he lost them since this debate? 
- No, I don't think he's lost them, but I think he's gonna have a serious enthusiasm problem if he can't turn some of this around. And I think that's what candidates like Harris and others saw as an opening, this sort of tone deafness on some issues that are very powerful and real for younger voters, for minority voters, for women voters. He has a very strong support in the African-American community, he's polling super well in places like South Carolina, but I think she wants to chip away at that and that's exactly why she went after him on that particular issue. 
- Joseph, the President has not said much about Kamala Harris and normally that could be a sign he's worried, or it could be that he hopes that Joe Biden rights the ship because he's got all these monikers, like Sleepy Joe-
- 
- Sleepy Joe. 
- And all this other stuff. But what is goin' there? 
- Look, I think that the President recognizes, as most of us do, that if you're talkin' about strictly demographics, Joe Biden causes the greatest threat to his pathway to reelection. I think what a lot of people-
- 
- [Neil] What did he keep stumbling like this? All of a sudden he's not such a threat. 
- Well, I think, look, he has to come out swingin', I think that in order to hold on to his support, particularly in communities of color, he actually must be prepared to lose it. I think that that means that he has to protect his record and not that I'm givin' them advice, but say to look, for the record, busing didn't work, we've got schools today that they're more segregated than they were during Jim Crow South. You know, he has to be prepared to say that this woman, who is a senator, who I have respect for, came out with an attack on an issue which she basically agrees with me on, for the purpose of selling t-shirts. 
- [Kat] Just needs to be prepared period. I just don't-
- 
- And he wasn't. 
- I don't understand-
- 
- He was prepared for questions about whether you pal around with segregationists, but apparently not for busing. 
- What was he doing then? Because if you think about it, back then, he's been out there a little bit more lately, but right before the debates, he wasn't making public appearances, he was doing, I don't know, because he didn't look prepared for the debate either. I don't know if he was watchin' cat videos on the internet or playin' Candy Crush, takin' naps, I don't know, but I don't understand why you wouldn't be prepared-
- 
- [Neil] Wouldn't that be cool if he was-
- 
- He was-
- 
- Like up there and actually playing Candy Crush. 
- Maybe he's addicted to Candy Crush. Maybe I just figured it out and that's why he did so poorly. I don't know, but I would think that if you were gonna be in front of millions of people watching you, you'd wanna do your homework. Just to not embarrass yourself. 
- In fairness, look, he's has a lifetime of experience and I'm sure he counted-
- 
- He admitted he wasn't prepared, though. 
- On that. And he admitted he wasn't-
- 
- He admitted that. 
- Look, he clearly had a bad night. The reality is, is it is incredibly difficult to sit at the top of the polls when you've got 24 people behind you chasing you and who are gonna dig into every piece of his record-
- 
- 'Cause look at Jeb Bush, he was at the top-
- 
- Yeah, I mean-
- 
- Of the polls and it evaporated. 
- It not a good place-
- 
- Please clap. 
- To be this early. Yeah, I mean, please clap. I mean he sorta had that moment. It's not a place to be and I've said from the beginning, I think his numbers are gonna continue to fall before they come back up. Look, Democrats have an enormous field of choices, an enormous set of issues to explore. There is a whole new generation of voters who don't have the history with him, that don't feel a set of connections with him-
- 
- Yeah, they don't know it and like a passing ship in the night. One of the things he said-
- 
- They don't. Listen, the key to this election, it's not just about the primary vote, right, what's gonna turn 2020 for the Democrats is going to be enthusiasm and energy of new voters, Gen Z, Gen Y-
- 
- And they don't have it for him. 
- Women and people of color, they have no history with him. 
- Let me ask you about where the path of the party lies and Joe Biden was saying of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, I'll ask you about this Joe, She's bright and brilliant, but too far left. In other words saying, our gains have come from more moderate victories, and he's right. Of the 40, I guess, who were elected to the House, I think 32 fit the moderate label, that might be over-generalizing it and not the Ocasio-Cortez label. But did in so saying that, did he kinda bury himself? 
- No, I think that he's speakin' the truth. Now having said that, that give him some trepidations and difficulties getting through this primary process, but the fact remains is that only people who are talkin' about this Democratic party expanding left, faster than the universe expands, are people who live in districts that they couldn't lose even if they are runnin' against a guy who-
- 
- [Neil] So you are arguing that he, when he says he's worried about the party moving too, too far left and promises Medicare-for-all, college education, college debt, rights for illegals and all that, that that isn't even in sync with his Democratic base? 
- I would say that it's 100% the fact that he's basically on the post of the party, more so than what AOC's talkin' about. That's why he's the front-runner, in spite of his performance. 
- I don't know if that's true. 
- I don't know, I don't know about that because look at after the debates, he lost so much support and Elizabeth Warren gained a lot of support and she is very, very progressive. Plus, we also know that primary voters tend to be more progressive than people votin' in general elections, so we might wind up with the-
- 
- Well, Republican primary voters tend to be more conservative in that, right? 
- Absolutely, yes. 
- He's tryin' to run a general election during a primary and that's-
- 
- And he hasn't won it yet. 
- And he hasn't won it yet. He tried to equivocate on that in the CNN interview, that he doesn't want to be presumptuous, et cetera, which he clearly-
- 
- Well, you want the Democrat to win, whoever it is, right? So do you get concerned that they could be spoiling it for themselves, offering things and promises and proposals that even the Democratic voter in this country doesn't support? 
- You know, I really don't, I don't and I don't because I think, look, what is the point of a primary in an environment like this? It's a battle of ideas. Ultimately, there's gonna be ideas far to the left, somewhere in the middle and then they're gonna land somewhere that's more in line with the American people, but I think it's a valuable process. That's why I actually, I don't agree with a lot of the people on the left who say we need to cull the field so quickly. There is a benefit to the whole country when you've got a lot of really qualified, experienced people debating a whole set of ideas about the future of the country. So I think it will swing back towards the center as we get closer to the nomination, but I think he's wrong to sort of hold this. Kat's right, he's gonna alienate a lot of the people that he really needs to turn out for him in the primaries if he's gonna win. 
- I disagree. I think that, again, Joe Biden is playin' a game right now where he believes that's he's goin' to depend on reliable voters. Reliable voters are older voters, they're older, black voters, those are the people that he's talkin' to, his performance, notwithstandin'. I think that he fell because he didn't do a very good job. 
- He had a bad night. 
- He kinda stunk. 
- [Kat] An understatement that he didn't do a very good job. 
- [Neil] Maybe he's just a lousy candidate. 
- But I think if you look at it, if look at Elizabeth Warren rising, I think that she's rising, not on the strength of Joe Biden, but on the strengths of the fact that people remember remember it now that she is the original person when it comes to those trillion dollar giveaways, she is the one with the plans towards Bernie's rhetoric and I think that you see Kamala Harris going after Biden because she realizes that her path to getting more money and her path to actually rise in the polls goes directly through Joe Biden. 
- Well that's the danger of bein' on top, right. 
- Yep. 
- The danger of bein' on top. Guys, I wanna thank you, thank you for coming in on a very hot Saturday, we appreciate that.

Flights, hotels, cars, activities, vacation rentals, Expedia, everything you need to go. 
- All right, I don't think the President is still a fan of the Federal Reserve, blasting in a two-part Tweet saying in part, Strong jobs report, low inflation and other countries around the world doing anything possible to take advantage of the United States, knowing that our Federal Reserve doesn't have clue! They raised rates too soon, too often and tightened while others did just the opposite. Then, to rub a little more salt in the wound, saying that, Our most difficult problem is not our competitors, it is the Federal Reserve! Joining me now, the former Fed nominee and Heritage Foundation Chief Economist Steve Moore. He will not let go of this, is that hurting him? What do you think? 
- Well, let me start by saying this, when I was driving in this morning, Neil, I was thinking that, I think you and I are about the same age, this may be the best economy we've seen in our lifetime. And when you've got the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years, you've got no inflation, you got rising wages, you got 7 1/2 million more jobs than people to fill them, the stock market is now officially up 50% since Donald Trump was elected-
- 
- So he's blaming the Fed that it could be a lot higher and by the way, I had no idea you were 39, touche. But what do you make of that-
- 
- You're a little younger than I am! (laughs) 
- He just won't let go. 
- But no, look, the reason I say that, Neil, as prefaced your question, isn't it about time we started giving this guy the benefit of the doubt. I mean, I remember during the campaign, workin' for Trump, and people said if Donald Trump is elected, we're gonna get us a second Great Depression, now we got the best economy in 50 years. And so, I think Trump, I've talked to him so many times about this, Neil, he is frustrated by the Fed. That's one of the reasons he nominated me, I think the Fed is too tight, as well. I think that the Fed-
- 
- [Neil] Well now he's naming two people-
- 
- I know, Judy Shel-
- 
- The interpretation is that they'll do his bidding and that they agree with him, what do you think of that? 
- They share his vision of the economy. Here's the problem with the Fed and this has been a problem not just recently, but for 30 years. The Fed believes that if you get too many people working, too much growth, wages rising, somehow they have to snuff that out. And Donald Trump, from the first time I met him, he said, We're gonna get this economy moving at three to 4% per year, way up from what we had under Obama, and his frustration is, Neil, every time we get a good jobs report, or every time the growth comes up where wages rise, the Fed wants to pull it back. I think that's wrong-headed, we can grow this economy without inflation faster and Trump is right about this-
- 
- Do you worry, though, and I get where you're coming and I get where the President's coming, he was proven right on that demands to the Fed when he did because they did go too far-
- 
- That's exactly right! 
- But having said that, does he recognize how weird it sounds to love a robust economy and a strong jobs report and still advocate for lower rates? It's like an oxymoron. 
- No, it isn't. We think the economy can grow even faster. I mean the economy, probably in the second quarter, we're only gonna get about 2% growth. The economy should be growing at three to four, by the way, if he gets that trade deal done with China and he gets the rate cut from the Fed that we want in July, if you think the economy's strong now, wait until that happens. So we just have a different model in mind. We think the capacity of the U.S. economy to grow faster, for more jobs to be created, more people in the workforce is a lot faster. I mean, remember, Larry Summers who was Bill Clinton and Barack Obama's economist, before the election said, The top-most growth we can get in this country is 2%. remember that second year stagnation-
- 
- [Neil] No, you're absolutely right, you're absolutely right. 
- And we're saying, no, we're throwin' that model out! We gonna grow this economy faster, it's gonna have a very positive effect. By the way, low inflation, low unemployment and how 'bout that, 50% increase in the stock market, that's $10 trillion of new wealth! 
- Since he was elected, that's very true. 
- There ya go. 
- All right, Steve Moore, great wisdom for a 39-year-old man, I appreciate that. Have a great weekend, my friend. 
- Have a great weekend. You, too. 
- Steve Moore. All right, a lot more coming up after this and then ask this question, millennials leaving cities so financially tight that they can't make it in the big city. What is that saying? After this.

- They're young and restless and now fleeing the big cities. In a new report of the Wall Street Journal, it shows millennials are getting out of the big cities to escape the rising cost of living. So is cheaper housing worth the switch to the subs, or suburbs? Back with us now is Erin Gibbs, Jonas Max Ferris, Deirdre Bolton, city residents all. (laughs) I don't even know if that's the case. Erin, what do ya think of this? 
- Well, I think this'll be good for logistic companies because they're gonna order everything from Amazon still, so I think that'll be my stock market play. It's gonna be great for FedEx-
-

- Is that where the parents' basements are? Is that why they're-
- 
- They've moved up to the attic. 
- I mean, look, I feel bad for millennials because these cities, their wealth is increasing faster than their salaries. They're entry-level workers in many cases and they don't make enough to keep up with the rising rents because all the tech workers and finance workers can pay higher rents. So it's a tough situation, but I don't think they're being creative enough. I do hear some stories about $1,200 pods they're moving into and like more unique things, living in vans and boats and they need to get creative. You can't just run from the city, that's where the income and the jobs are and they're gonna try to save money and be commuting three hours a day, which isn't a good solution either. 
- In fairness, the income inequality really is growing. I mean, we're sort of at a period in time that I think hasn't been the same since the late 1920s, so I actually feel bad for this group of kids, too. Most of them do have student debt and we know, outside of mortgage debt, this is actually the biggest chunk that Americans are carrying. So there are a lot of factors and I think you're right, it's still expensive to live in cities, which is why sometimes-
- 
- I wonder whether they take that frustration out at the polls, if it's palpable to the degree you say it is, right? 
- Well, I think that is part of Senator Sanders appeal or other leftist candidates, especially that student debt forgiveness. I mean if you ignore how (laughs) we're gonna pay for it, or any of the logistics behind that-
- 
- [Neil] Tax Jonas. 
- I think that message resonates for a reason. 
- I think it's a matter of whether they show up to the polls, though, 'cause we do see consistently low rates in actually voting. So they may have a very large voice, but whether that actually carries forward to the votes is a whole 'nother story. 
- Do you think their frustrations are justifiable, though, that they're really going through something here that we, as a nation, have to pay attention to? If they're leaving the city to this degree. 
- I'm not clear, I haven't decided yet. I haven't seen a big enough economic shift, at least in the markets, where we don't see them not spending. They're still buying the iPhones, they're still-
- 
- And I see a lot of young people here in the city-
- 
- Yes, so I'm still saying we're still seeing the consumer spending, so maybe I think it maybe it's more of a value shift. I don't see that consumer spending is suddenly dropping off from millennials, they still contribute an enormous amount to the economy. So I think it's a matter of value where they don't-
- 
- Well they buy all, the streaming services, right? 
- Wanna pay for rent, but they'll pay the streaming services. So, from a Wall Street perspective, I don't see them doing as poorly. They're spending money. 
- You know, it's funny, the people that vote are the people in the rent-controlled apartments that aren't even working anymore or they're retired. These are apartments they moved in the '60s in New York, they're paying $200 a month rent, hogging up space that people-
- 
- Makes me cry, yeah. 
- Who work have to commute two hours. So it's actually a failed liberal policy that has driven millennials out-
- 
- But that's kind of a New York phenomenon, not exclusively, right? 
- San Francisco, you would think it's an old '60s relic, but I believe in Portland, Oregon they just added rent control, like that's a solution to this. That only increases the problem later, but it takes a while and it seems like a thing people vote for. 
- But in those hot cities, especially for tech, I saw something online and it was a shack you would not leave a dog in, and it was on a 1/4 of an acre and it was $1.5 million, but because it was in San Francisco. So I do think it's hard for millennials to come up with $200,000 to put down as a down payment in a house, or an apartment in New York City, San Francisco, obviously there are cheaper cities-
- 
- But isn't this rising-
- 
- Austin, Texas. 
- Economic tide lifting all boats, or no? 
- For the most part, it is. In fact, we see that when it comes to wage growth, when it comes to unemployment, particularly with minorities. We've seen just a massive rise and more so with some of the hardest hit demographics, minority women, minorities in general, have had some of the greatest rises. So I think overall, we're doing really well and millennials are just, I think they're really just shifting their values. They don't wanna pay as much money for the cities, they don't wanna pay as much rent-
- 
- [Neil] Yeah, they've been burnt-
- 
- But they still buy $100,000 iPhones. 
- But they've been burnt by the meltdown, they remember what their parents went through and may be very cautious.
