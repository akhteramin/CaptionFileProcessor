- Welcome to TMZ Live, Harvey Levin here. 
- Charles here. 
- Bill Cosby is giving lectures behind bars on parenting, on drug abuse, and on getting a job. And he's drawing huge crowds. 
- He is essentially, and extremely popular motivational speaker in the prison where he is serving his term. 
- Now, this may sound crazy to you, because Bill Cosby, at the end of this trial where he was convicted, you know of drugging Andrea Constand and assaulting her, You would think that people aren't listening to Bill Cosby anymore, they are. They are behind bars. 
- And it's happening multiple times a week. This is three, four times a week, and up to 100 prisoners will elect to come to these things, it's not a required or mandatory thing. These guys are coming to listen to him talk. 
- And you know, Brandon and I were talking about this, that you think about, what is it that's different between them and people on the outside? And you know, people in prison, especially if they've been there a long time, they are locked into the Cosby show. 
- Right. 
- And didn't necessarily connect to-
- 
- But they know why he's there. 
- They do indeed, but it doesn't seem to matter the way it matters on the outside. 
- Brad, do we know if, is he like acknowledging: Look I've made mistakes, is that part of his-
- 
- He has maintained his innocence through this whole thing, and actually to the Cosby show part, his rep told us whenever he's there to visit Bill, a lot of the prisoners still refer to him as their dad or their father figure, and that's I think, also part of why they're listening to him here. 
- And you know there are people, you know, who commit certain crimes in prison, or commit certain crimes in the outside, and when they come in they're looked on with disfavor. It is the opposite with Bill Cosby. 
- [Commentator] Yeah, I mean, it's dicey. I mean-
- 
- Yeah. 
- In this particular case, it's dicey for a lot of reasons, number one: The crimes of Bill Cosby, a big deal I've heard, heinous and deplorable, right? At the same time, there are still people that look at him with a certain affinity, and up until those crimes were made public, he was an insanely successful person. So if you're going to, in a vacuum, if you're gonna listen to somebody on how to become successful, or things that you need to do to reclaim success, or start some of your own, he wouldn't be a bad guy to listen to besides all of the other stuff you don't wanna hear that's coming out of his mouth. So, if you're inside, you might look at it differently. 
- So Brad, in terms of the substance of what he's talking about with parenting, I think he's talking about re-bonding. 
- Yeah, because a lot of the guys that he speaks to are going to be out on parole soon. So they've lost time with their kids so it's about re-bonding with your family and your children when you get out. And it's also about how to interview for jobs, and go find work right away so that you're provided opportunities that don't land you back behind bars. 
- [Harvey] It's interesting that-
- 
- It's not that what he's saying, what he's saying, I'm sure there's, clearly there's value in it. 
- Yeah. 
- There's value in it, and a lot of these men he's speaking to in there can learn something from it and from him. It's just weird that it's coming from him after what he was convicted of-
- 
- But I guess the question-
- 
- I guess the question, when you're on the inside everybody has made-
- 
- If not, a rue. Everyone's made a mistake. 
- Everyone there has made a mistake, clearly. 
- Right. 
- At the same time, you know, listen, if you're incarcerated, whatever it is that you're incarcerated for, you would hope that someone would spend their time inside, incarcerated, to try to do something positive. Like anything, you know, toothpaste you can squeeze out of the tube. I guess it's just a weird thing coming from Bill Cosby at this point with the ideas that we have in our head about him right now. 
- I just think it would be less distasteful if he were acknowledging some wrongdoing while teaching these lessons. And because he isn't, it's like if he's not contrite, then for people on the outside, it's just difficult to hear him being a leader. That's how I feel, that's what I think. That's why this story seems weird to people I think. 
- Hi, my name is Markeish Johnson, and I am from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. And speaking about Bill Cosby, I think it is very rare for us on the outside to hear of what Bill Cosby is doing, however I think it is very beneficial to the inmates that are coming out on parole, due to the fact that you know, they're gonna come back on the outside, they're going to re-bond with their families and rebuild and try to fit into that life again. So, I think it is a good idea for Bill to be doing something of that, while he's incarcerated, but he also needs to admit to his wrongdoings as well. 
- Mayor Pete Buttigieg is an incredibly, we know he's very accomplished-
- 
- [Harvey] Smart. 
- [Charles] Incredibly smart guy, Road Scholar. 
- [Harvey] He speaks multiple languages by the way. 
- Speaks multiple languages, which was on display in New York City. 
- So he's walking down the street, and this dude comes up to him, and the guy is from Malta. And he is actually, he is the president. What's funny enough it's a president-hopeful meets a president. He's the president of a Maltese club in a store in New York. So, (laughs) the guy starts talking to Buttigieg, and we're not gonna tell you the whole thing-
- 
- Here's a little bit. 
- In Maltese, watch this. 
- All right, my people, Maltese. 
- [Charles] So you want to be President. It's not the weather. 
- [Harvey] No, I don't know. 
- [Charles] No, they're having a talk. 
- [Harvey] I know, but what are they talking about? 
- [Charles] We know, because we have Maltese spies. 
- All right, so here's what I know, that what the guy from Astoria is saying is he's inviting Buttigieg-
- 
- [Charles] This is a rough translation. 
- Well yeah, I talked to somebody. So he invited Buttigieg to come speak at the club that he runs in Astoria, and then decided to sweeten the pot by saying that if you show up, we're gonna give you, help me out with the name of this thing, the can, it's a dessert. What's the name of it again? 
- It is called, I don't know. Oh here it is, pastizzi. 
- Pastizzi. 
- Pastizzi. 
- Which is a, it's kind of like a cannoli with a soft crust on it. I believe it's ricotta cheese inside. But they ended up talking 
- That doesn't sound like a dessert. 
- And it turns out that Buttigieg was asking this guy, where he was from. 
- Where his family was from in Malta. 
- And then Buttigieg said that his grandparents were in a nearby town, and they live next door to a guy named Anton Buttigieg, not related to him. 
- Not related, but they're the same-
- 
- Became president of Malta. So, Buttigieg is like Smith in Malta. 
- In Malta. 
- Because there are a lot of people named Buttigieg, which I didn't know either, so it's kind of interesting. 
- Another thing that we learned here, first of all we should say in addition to Maltese, Mayor Pete also speaks Italian, French, Norwegian, Spanish. 
- Spanish. 
- [Commentator] He's read books in those foreign languages too, like he doesn't just speak though, like he really knows them. 
- [Charles] And he also speaks some Arabic, anyway. 
- [Harvey] So, I was just interested-
- 
- The other thing we learned is, and we should say this 'cause I don't wanna make the assumption that everyone knows where Malta is, Malta is a small island in the Mediterranean, and it's basically between Africa and the end of the Italian boot. 
- Thank you for that. 
- Some people think that it's near Greece for some reason. 
- It is near Greece. 
- It's not near Greece. 
- Well it is near Greece. 
- It's near to Africa. 
- It is near Greece. 
- It's very near to Africa. 
- I didn't say nearer, I said near Greece. 
- Tunisia, Tunisia, that's where it is. 
- It is near Greece. 
- Look on a map, folks. 
- Look on a map and you'll see. 
- And you'll understand that-
- 
- You will see that it's near Greece. 
- And we're done. 
- Hi, this is Glorashtee, I'm calling from Chesapeake, Virginia. Mayor Pete is going to sneak up on us all. He has the unique ability to bond and blend, and connect genuinely with just about everyone. And he's only like what, 19 (laughs). 
- You got some millennial shade? 
- It might a bit. (laughs) It might a bit. 
- Look, I think what's really fascinating about him, we gotta move on, is that he is a true intellectual. And, it's interesting that, you know, how America receives that 
- Receives that-
- 
- I think they're gonna receive it well. 
- Right, instead of-
- 
- Because you also can relate to people. 
- Right, what you're saying is that there's always the chance that some people feel alienated from that, that like you're-
- 
- You know who'd change that? 
- Who? 
- James Holzhauer. 
- Oh, there you go. Let's get some dancing in. Very real dancing. Beyonce and Jay Z's little girl's all grown up. 
- Well she's seven. 
- She's seven, but that's old enough to be the star of a dance recital. Blue Ivy attends Debbie Allen's Dance Academy, here in the LA area. I think it's in Inglewood, actually. And she had a recital and was doing her thing. She actually also-
- 
- [Harvey] She's good. 
- [Charles] Yeah, she looks good. Now she did this, but there was another time when she's performing to one of Beyonce's songs, Before I Let Go, and-
- 
- She's really good. 
- Which has gotta be, I don't know, is that weird for her? Well I guess, my mom. 
- No, it's not weird for her because they probably play the song all the time in the house. She probably listens to the radio, it's always on the radio. And kids love that song, everybody loves that song right now. Like, there's a huge viral Before I Let Go challenge that I'm sure she does at home in her mirror with her mom, so it feels like at home, and she's killing it, so. 
- [Harvey] Do the other kids think it's weird, then? 
- [Commentator] No, they're kids. They're like six years old. 
- Why don't we just let these babies dance. 
- My niece loves this song. 
- Let these babies dance. 
- But Beyonce redid this song and brought it back for 
- Hey, hey. Uncle Van, Uncle Van. 
- a whole other generation. 
- Easy Uncle Van, okay. 
- What you saying, man, it's a bunch of kids. Is it weird for 'em? Let these babies dance, man. 
- Let these babies dance. 
- [Charles] Fine, okay. Dance babies, go ahead. 
- God, can we take a break? Oh my god. 
- Yes please, let's do this.

- [Narrator] If you come at the Queen, you best not mess. 
- Welcome back to TMZ Live. If you're Halle Berry, and you come home to your fabulous house, only to discover-
- 
- [Harvey] It ain't your house no more. 
- [Charles] It's not your house. It's just-
- 
- [Harvey] This is mind-boggling. 
- [Charles] That's a good word, mind boggling-
- 
- So she literally, there's a guy who tried to steal Halle Berry's house. Steal her whole damn house. 
- Yup, how in the world do you pull off something like that? 
- Well he figure out a way. 
- Yes, police say this is how a guy named Ronald Eugene Griffin (laughs) tried to do it. 
- [Commentator] This is such a crazy story. 
- [Charles] It's so, it's actually simple. 
- [Harvey] It starts with a locksmith. 
- So this guy firstly comes back to the house in January and tries to fiddle with the locks, and the gardener comes, he goes, What are you doing here? And he takes off. He comes back later, like a month later. He comes back with a locksmith and they start working on the outside locks, and they get one of the locks changed. And someone from the house who works there goes, Hey, what are you doing? He goes, Oh, I'm the new owner of the house, I have the deed here. The person from the house says, Well I'm gonna call the cops. Well this guy goes, Well I'm gonna call the cops too. 
- [Harvey] Because I have the deed. 
- Yeah, I mean this is so crazy. 
- So the person who's lived, this is one of Halle's homes in the L.A. area, it's not, apparently not her main home. 
- [Harvey] But, but-
- 
- [Charles] If there's a staff, again, at that point right there, then to me that's where an alarm should have gone off that the staff, or whoever was there at the house might make a call to Halle Berry or somebody-
- 
- I think they did call her, they called the police, and then eventually this guy, they investigated, this guy ended up being arrested. 
- So they started looking at this guy. But the guy actually forged the deed. 
- [Commentator] Right, forged the deed, and this is more common than you believe now. There's a whole division that deals just with this. People are doing this. They'll steal a whole house, they'll go and change the deed. 
- And one of the problems with this is if you think about it, and this has been a big thing in California and in a lot of other states, where elderly people especially, they get taken advantage of, and it's done in various ways where they, you know, a roofer will come and say, Hey, you know what, sign this contract, and we'll put a new roof on, and they end up foreclosing. But this is way more bold but-
- 
- Yeah, this is, I mean it's shocking having to steal a whole house. 
- But if somebody doesn't have the staff to fight back, like Get out, it's my house now. 
- Yeah, I mean if it's a rental house or something, you go there and they're like, No. And then you gotta go through the process of evicting them, and getting them out legally and they could be there for a while. 
- So remember, Halle Berry has had issues with, you know, intruders in her home. I don't know if you remember but four or five years ago, she literally came back to her house, got in the kitchen, looked out the glass window in the kitchen and there's a guy facing her on her property staring at her who's trying to get inside the house. And it was somebody who apparently had been persistent. So she's had these problems before. 
- Correct. 
- But apparently the guy didn't know it was Halle Berry's house. 
- No, I mean this house was under a trust, so he had no idea, it's just random luck that it was Halle's, or unlucky for Halle. 
- Bad luck, bad luck for him also. 
- He got arrested. 
- He got arrested. 
- Hey, I'm Ariel Jones from Atlanta, Georgia. I think that it's just so weird that you find another person in your home, especially Halle Berry, and it's like how he'd think that he would get away with that. 
- [Harvey] That's actually a really good question. 
- [Charles] Well that's what I was gonna say, like I can't imagine how he did, but the fact that he did this makes you think that he probably did actually pull this off at some point. 
- This is such an important point. My dad owned a liquor store, and I don't remember what happened, but we always used to say that bank robbers don't start robbing banks, they start stealing candy at liquor stores. 
- Correct. 
- And then they graduate up. So to go to a really nice house where you know there are employees there. 
- He probably pulled it off with a smaller house. 
- That's right. 
- They're worth less. And you're just wondering how many times has this happened, and are they getting, you know, people who are struggling out of their house and saying, Go, go, you're gone, it's my house now. And they do it. I mean it's crazy. Okay, we're gonna move on. 
- We got some video now of a huge brawl that broke out, I guess it's not a huge brawl, it's only two people. 
- It's a brawl. 
- But man it was vicious. On a New York City street corner, this is in SoHo, two women for various reasons, according to witnesses, just started going at it until a Hollywood actor named Peter Greene, you know him from Pulp Fiction, you know him from The Mask. He plays-
- 
- He's a pretty good actor. 
- Yeah, he's played the villain in a lot of things. He played Zed in Pulp Fiction. But he happened to walk by while everyone else was watching what was going on-
- 
- Jumped into action. 
- He jumped in. 
- Stop fighting! Just calm down, just calm down. Hey, hey, no, stop fighting! Stop hurting her! Stop hurting her with the rag! 
- Yo, stop hurting-
- 
- Stop it, stop it! Stop it! Why can't you two stop it, what's the matter with you? You let 'em fight? You're a grown man, what the (beeps). No, tell you! Stop the fighting between two women. What's the matter with you? 
- [Pedestrian] How come he didn't stop it. 
- (beeps) Stop it. 
- [Charles] You could see at the end there Peter was ticked off. 
- Grief with Peter Greene. 
- The people he was yelling at are New York City traffic agents who were standing on the corner. 
- And just watching it. 
- And watching it happen, so he was chastising them. 
- Good for him. 
- You can understand why he'd be mad. I mean, isn't that their job to keep the peace? Why are they just standing there watching two girls beat the hell out of each other? 
- Well, yeah, I mean, look, they do work for NYPD, they're not actual officers, they're traffic agents, but they do work for NYPD. 
- [Harvey] There's a problem, and you know it's interesting 'cause Peter, you know, these bikes are not cheap. And Peter just kind of throw down his bike. 
- Well no. 
- [Harvey] Well yeah, I mean it's pretty valiant when he did it. 
- [Commentator] All the human trauma happening and Harvey's not listening. 
- Harvey's looking at how expensive that bike is. 
- I'm concerned about that bike. 
- [Harvey] No, I'm just saying it's a marker of how he's stepped in, he was such a good Samaritan. I think it just adds to-
- 
- [Commentator] Stop right there, Pete, you don't wanna pick up a charge yourself. 
- [Charles] Right. (laughing) Good for him. 
- It is good to step in. But I don't know, Tim, 
- Well you wanna see the side of her face-
- 
- The traffic people, I don't know if they're like, if that's part of their job description, they give out tickets, right? 
- It's probably not. Yeah I know, but you know. 
- I think if the fight had spilled over into the crosswalk, then it affects traffic, then they would get involved. I'm guessing, but I-
- 
- [Commentator] Or they could just be decent human beings. 
- [Harvey] Well, yes. 
- [Commentator] Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on, stop, stop, stop. So a decent human being puts themselves-
- 
- [Harvey] Yeah, at risk. 
- [Commentator] At risk to get in the middle of somebody fighting? 
- [Harvey] And someone's spitting, also. I don't know about that man. 
- [Commentator] Obviously, y'all never really been around that bit fighting. You let them go 'til they tired. 
- Yeah, there's a difference between being a good Samaritan and not being decent. I mean, look, people don't wanna get involved, it happens. But, I mean, good for Peter Greene. 
- Good for Peter Greene is what we should be sayin'. Don't shame everybody else, Peter Greene did something heroic. 
- I'm Victoria Brownlee from Greensboro, North Carolina. And I must say that video was pretty amazing, he did it just so effortlessly, and then put everybody else in his place. His status just went up 10 notches in my opinion. 
- All right. 
- Okay, and we're moving on. 
- Okay, wanna hear about a cool cat? 
- (laughs) A real cool cat is gonna make a lot of money, at least that is the plan. You guys know Benjamin Button, right? Not the movie character, but more importantly Taylor Swift's feline. 
- Yes, her third cat, her newest cat added to the family earlier this year, is now officially part of the gang, because she has added Benjamin to her trademark. Now, last year she had, how do you get Benjamin Button as a trademark? 
- She got a-
- 
- Well it's Meredith, Olivia and Benjamin Swift. So that's the difference, and now she's gonna-
- 
- It's almost like Benjamin Button is a nickname, but his trademark name 
- Oh, his government name 
- is Swift. 
- is Benjamin Swift. 
- Yes. 
- I got it. 
- Yeah, so Taylor added Benjamin to the trademark she had-
- 
- [Harvey] Has she done anything with the other cats in terms of marketing anything? 
- Yes she has, Meredith and then the other one, Olivia, have been like all over T-Shirts and everything like that. So she has already been selling all that merch, and now with him, I mean it's just gonna be even more cuter. And she wants to do like cellphone cases, luggage, I mean there's so much opportunity for this guy, and you guys, with grumpy cat passing away, the cat community is heartbroken. 
- There's a hole in the market, yeah. 
- There is absolutely a spot for a new cat to come in and take over. 
- You know that Benjamin's not actually gonna make any money, right? Like the money all goes to Taylor. 
- No, you're kidding me! 
- Well, I've just seen, we wanted to let Charlie know, because she sounded pretty excited about opportunities for Benjamin. 
- You guys, maybe it's not about the money for him, maybe he just wants the fame. 
- See, that's why I needed Florida. 
- Yeah, he's a clot chaser, he's a cat chaser. Taking a break.

- [Narrator] It's TMZ. 
- Welcome back to TMZ Live. Most of the faces are the same, but man have their lives changed dramatically. Talking about the cast of The Hills. The reboot The Hills: New Beginnings on MTV. And yes, you will see a lot of faces that you know, A couple of faces that are new. 
- [Harvey] They've had a decade to grow. 
- Yeah. 
- And change. And what's interesting is, everybody thought Heidi and Spencer was only for the cameras back then. Remember, it was 2006 to 2010. And there was a come on, Heidi and Spencer, they're together. 
- Still together. 
- They're married. 
- Married, and yeah, there's that little guy who is on the show, which is interesting because we know that having kids on reality shows-
- 
- Problematic. 
- Can be problematic. So joining us right now to talk about all of that is Spencer Pratt. 
- [Harvey] Hey Spencer, sir. 
- [Charles] Welcome back to TMZ Live, how you doin', man? 
- Oh my god, whoa. Can I see your guys' faces, I can't see my big head like that. 
- Where are you? 
- Where are you? That's beautiful. 
- That looks awesome. 
- That is Crested Butte mountains. 
- Ah, Colorado! 
- This is where I grew up. We're visiting her family, oh my god. 
- [Charles] Montana? 
- [Harvey] No, Colorado. 
- Colorado. 
- Crested Butte, Colorado. I didn't know if it was Colorado. God it's beautiful there. 
- Isn't it though, yeah. 
- [Harvey] Holy smokes. 
- It's unreal I was wondering if you wanted to enjoy the view. 
- Well we appreciate that. So listen man, because it's been a decade, and there were no, when you guys were partying in Hollywood back then, nobody was bringing baby strollers. 
- Yeah! 
- [Charles] Or car seats, so how's this gonna work out? 
- That was a big drama thing for my wife, because she is an attachment parent. So the first part of The Hill, she doesn't really go out, and she's having serious, I would say emotional breakdowns just leaving our son. 'Cause for the first year she never left Gunner for longer than a minute, which is amazing, but is was also very challenging, so thankfully for The Hills, she gets to a point where she can go out and be a regular mom, that is fun, and has a drink. But, that was very challenging initially. 
- Okay, I got a question because that, I didn't know this. So, this sounds like a, was she preventing you from parenting because she was doing it all the time? That's what I'm hearing. 
- No, no I was there, I could leave the house, she was way more like extreme. Obviously, Gunner didn't come out of my body, so I imagine that connection's a little bit more intense than, you know, my connection. 
- That's a fair assessment probably, yeah (laughing). 
- So what about, you've heard about Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna arguing over whether their kid can go on a reality show, and whatnot. Do you have any like trepidations about Gunner-
- 
- Yeah, did you guys talk about it? 
- Sometimes it doesn't end well. 
- What was the conversation like before you made the decision about having him on? 
- All due respect to Rob and Blac Chyna, but we've been together 12 years, so our relationship's a little stronger than those two, which you know I hope I-
- 
- That's not shade, those are facts. 
- Yeah, yeah, so I think that's the difference. We're very aware of what reality TV does, and if Gunner initially had not enjoyed the process, and you know, didn't like people, we wouldn't have done it. But he would cry when they would leave. He would be trying to hold the boom mics, and it was like fun, almost like an adventure for him, so. You know, he's more like an Asahd, he's like DJ Khaled's son, they were born for it. 
- Okay Spencer, we're gonna play a game. This is total fantasy land. Pretend I'm 19 years old, and I'm trying to figure out 
- Okay, what is going on here? 
- what I'm gonna watch tonight, and I'm thinking, wait a minute, these folks are married now, they got a kid. I wanna see people partying and doing whatnot, what they did in the OG, so-
- 
- Wooh, I got you Mister 19-year-old Harvey Levin. Okay, let me tell you about Brandon Thomas Lee, the son of Tommy Lee, the son of Pamela Anderson. He just turned 22. He is the King of Hollywood. The guy has more dates than anybody I've ever seen in my life. He's got breaking hearts, he's a freaking supermodel, walking runways. Real talk, he's cooler than any of us ever were when we were on The Hills, he's the next level. So he's bringing that 19-year-old interest. And then if you're one of these older people-
- 
- More seasoned, more seasoned. 
- Yeah, or better, but I will say that one thing about being a parent is when you do get to go out, like I was allowed out two nights a week. I party harder than any 21-year-old could ever party, 'cause I'm like, I'm out of the house, ha! So I would say I drank and partied harder than ever before on this season. I was actually, like my goal was to out-party any of these other reality shows. And I think I did it, I was going to every scene with two bottles of Don Julio, so. 
- Oh gosh! 
- Excellent answers, Spencer. 
- All right. 
- Excellent answer, yeah. 
- Thank you, thank you. 
- I think 19-year-old Harvey is in. 
- By the way, there was once a 19-year-old. 
- I know. 
- Brandon is a superstar. He cut out his own show on MTV, just called Brandon, so he's our ringer. 
- [Harvey] He is-
- 
- You gotta send in the ringer. 
- Okay, Spencer congratulations, it's amazing. You guys endured the show, endured, it's amazing. 
- Thank you Harvey, I will tell this now finally feels real to talk to you again, I feel like I'm in a time machine. 
- I know, this is crazy. 
- It's like old times, like old times. 
- Spencer, congrats and send the same regards to Heidi.

- Welcome back to TMZ Live. It may have been the, well actually I'm gonna say was the most menacing news: O. J. Simpson saying that he's got some people to get even with, therefore he's gonna join Twitter. He made this big announcement and then he now has a Twitter account, and the first, I don't know if this is someone he feels he needs to get even with, but the first thing he chose to address was, who is Khloe Kardashian's father. This has been a long held rumor that O. J.-
- 
- Unsubstantiated. 
- Yes, that O. J. is Khloe's dad, and I think, Kris has addressed this 
- The family just poo-pooed it 
- I think Khloe's addressed it, right. 
- They just said come on. 
- But O. J. wanted to give his two cents on it. Here's what he said and pay close attention-
- 
- The way he says it. 
- It's not so much even Khloe, it's what he's saying about Kris. 
- Kris. 
- Bob Kardashian, he's like a brother to me, he's a great guy. He met and married Kris, they really had a terrific time together when they were together. Unfortunately that ended. But never, and I wanna stress never, in any way shape or form had I ever had any interest in Kris romantically or sexually. And I never got any indication that she had any interest in me, so all of these stories are just bogus, bad, you know tasteless. Khloe, like all the girls, I'm very proud of, just like I know Bob would be if he was here. But to simplify to the matter, is she's not mine. 
- This guy, he's so pathetic. I mean he's just doing this because the attention was running low, and here we are again talking about something that we already knew the answer to, but of course, he just has to try and lend his voice to it. 
- [Both] Yeah. 
- I was actually, as I was listening to what he was saying what was the thing about Kris, where he says, Look I had no interest in her whatsoever. He knows that she didn't have any interest in him. 
- Well no, but that's kind of incidental, I mean the beginning is I had no interest in her. 
- Well I disagree that it's incidental, he said it both ways, he said It didn't happen, I wasn't in to her. 
- [Harvey] And as far as I know. 
- And she never told me she was into me, so. 
- [Charles] It sounds odd, but it seems honest from O. J. 
- [Harvey] But why not just say Hey it just didn't happen? 
- [Charles] I don't know. 
- [Commentator] Not only did it not happen-
- 
- [Harvey] Give me more proof! 
- But what he's saying is, Not only did it not happen that I'm not, it's just there was nothing between us like that. It's not that there was some kind of flame that we never acted on, this was not a thing. 
- [Charles] Right. 
- That would be enough. 
- The reason it just feels weird is because, honestly it's O. J. just being honest. And that just feels weird. 
- It feels weird 'cause, why are you on Twitter, dog? 
- As you were speaking I was just going, Wait, what is this end game here? 
- It seems like-
- 
- And you know what the end game has to be somehow, right? 
- What? 
- For him, he thinks it's money. 
- Money. 
- And somehow he's gonna get a certain number of followers and that somehow he's gonna be able to translate that into money. 
- If anybody should be willing to like, you know, cut their losses and just go ahead and live out the rest of their life and just virtual obscurity, it should be O. J. 
- It should be O. J. Don't be trying to get like a professional deal. 
- You could have made that argument after the murder trial. 
- Yes. 
- And it just, you know-
- 
- But he refused to, and you know where it got him. 
- Hi, my name is Erica Chestane, I'm from Georgia. When these O. J. tweets started popping up on my timeline, I didn't know what to think. And then he said that the Khloe rumors are bad, bogus and tasteless. But you can't take something seriously from a guy who wrote a book called If I Did It. 
- [Harvey] Yeah, (laughs) right. 
- Honestly to me, Khloe pre-op looks just like O. J. And if you put a picture of Sydney Simpson up against Khloe Kardashian pre-op, it's undeniable. It's like they're twins. 
- So, Melissa, sorry, Erica. 
- It's deniable. 
- So Erica, you just came on here and you're just gonna completely start this up again? Like everybody involved has shot it down. 
- People look like other people, and also Sydney Simpson, I mean, that would be a different mother, so none of them, it just doesn't make sense. 
- And how many times are you gonna say pre-op? That's like the game, man. That's all I heard, that's shady, dog. 
- A lot of shade, a lot of shade. We're gonna move on. 
- Mafia rules do not apply for George Lopez when dealing with President Trump. You know Mafia rules, you leave women and children out. 
- [Harvey] That's true. 
- Right, because George is going after the first family, and specifically on the immigration policies of the administration, and says that he has no issues dragging children into it. I get that the President has older adult children, but even Barron. This is the post that George Lopez put up, and made the point of including Barron in there. Barron who is 13 years old, and making it clear that he's from an immigrant mother. 
- [Harvey] Right. 
- [Charles] (laughs) And that actually all of his children also, his first wife, also an immigrant so-
- 
- [Harvey] Not all maples, not Tiffany. 
- No, you're right, Tiffany is not included there. So yes, calling them all anchor babies. So we got George out 'cause a lot of people feel like, look, obviously people are very critical of the immigration policy, that's one thing. But when you start bringing, you know, minor children into it. 
- Kids, yeah. 
- [Charles] Does it cross the line? 
- So we got him out. 
- Yeah. 
- [Interviewer] Do you think it's fair to put Barron in that post? 
- Why? 
- [Interviewer] He's a kid, you know. 
- Is it fair to put kids in cages? They're kids. Let's go Ancestry.com and 23andMe, so everybody's swabbing the insides of their mouth to find out where they came from, and you know what we can all agree on? Is that nobody is from here. Immigration has always been a problem and it will continue to be a problem, but only targeting Latinos is not good. 
- [Harvey] So you know who would disagree with him? 
- Who's that? 
- The Obamas. They made it very clear. 
- Children-
- 
- During the presidency that unless, you know, Sasha and Malia were part of an event where, you know, 
- Right. 
- they were there. 
- They did not want them to be 
- They really were against them even being photographed, because they said they didn't sign up for this. I think they would disagree with that. 
- I think a lot of presidential families actually would disagree with it. I think the Clintons would disagree with it because they also fought for privacy for Chelsea because she was in the limelight as well during their presidency and faced a lot of, you know, undue attention and a lot of criticism, meanness, and this was before the era of social media. But of course I think what George is referring to, you know here by targeting Donald Trump's children, is again sort of all of the actions that have been taken by the administration against children at the border. Putting them in cages. So, I mean, I think the point that he's trying to make, you know, might be a valid one, but it's using people that is unfair, in unfair way. 
- Here's the thing. He could make the point just with Donald Jr. and Eric and Ivanka. He doesn't have to go to Barron. 
- [Charles] You don't have to go to Barron. 
- And that's why it's a little problematic. 
- Hey guys, how you doin', my name's Dominic. This issue is a little pressing. I would say instead of targeting Barron Trump, he includes him. In a way yes, he's wrong for you to include the family, but to compare the Obamas and the Clintons to the Trumps is literally comparing apples to oranges. 
- I don't think it is, I gotta stop you there. 
- Could you erase politics-
- 
- Yeah. 
- And just say it's about-
- 
- It's about a family with minor kids. 
- Right. 
- And the issue is do you, because once you, look, here's the thing. This country is divided almost down the middle, so whatever you allow on this side, this side's gonna do. So, at a point you have to have a policy. If the policy is minor kids are not fair game, then they're not fair game on either side. But if they're fair game on one side, they're gonna be fair game on the other side. 
- Right. 
- I mean, it's just the way it works. 
- 'Cause you gotta look at it without the politics. 
- Right, okay, taking a break.

- Welcome back to TMZ Live, Harvey and Van here. 
- What up. 
- I'm really excited about this show today, I mean this is great. I love John Ratzenberger. 
- Ah man. 
- I just love John Ratzenberger. 
- I know one reason why you love him, and I'm gonna say this because you like people who are talented, but you also like people who have two different distinct acts. 
- Yes, that's exactly right. 
- John Ratzenberger was on Cheers, huge show. 
- Huge star. 
- Biggest show on television. And now, to be in every single Pixar movie, and has a fantastic second career doing that. 
- I love that, I love that. Well speaking of, Toy Story 4 sounds amazing, I mean the cast is amazing. And there is kind of a posthumous character on this. 
- [Van] Right. 
- So, I can't wait to bring him in. John, welcome to TMZ Live. 
- Thank you, thanks for that nice intro. 
- Well, it's well deserved. So, a lot of people were shocked because everybody thought maybe Toy Story 3 was the end, So this is a huge surprise. 
- [John] Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if they did a fifth one, to tell you the truth. 
- [Van] Really? 
- It might not be done in my lifetime, but somewhere down the line. 
- How long did it take to do? 
- What, Toy Story 4? I think it took 'em about three to four years somewhere. 
- Gosh that it a big investment. You know, I love the cast, I mean in addition to you, you got Tom Hanks, you've got Tim Allen. I love that Tony Hale is in the show. He's so funny, he was so amazing on Veep. 
- Yeah, the way they see him on this, I think he's the funniest character in the movie. (mumbles) The character he plays is hysterical. 
- John, I gotta ask you something, I saw Toy Story 3, and of course it was a phenomenal movie, made huge money, broke all kinds of records. But at the end, it was sad, it was a very, very sad tough watch. There were people in the theater crying and stuff like that. There are people out there, parents who are concerned about bringing their kids to the movie if it's gonna be that sad. Does this one have kind of the same tenor as Toy Story 3, or is it a little bit different? 
- Well, so the kids don't have to wait 'till their grandfather dies, you know. It'll give 'em a chance to work through the sadness at an early age. It's not that sad, it's sad but it's not that sad. 
- So, that's hilarious. Don Rickles, you know, he played Mr. Potato Head. He passed in 2017. You guys brought him back. 
- Well yeah, yeah Josh did, the director. He searched for hours and hours over old tape that they had for Don in the other Toy Stories and of some promos he did. So he cobbled together Don's part from those tapes. 
- [Van] That is actually amazing. 
- It's amazing. John, I just gotta ask you 'cause what Van said at the beginning is so right. I mean, you've just had the most incredible career. I'm just curious about when you finished with Cheers, 'cause there's so many people who think it'll never get bigger than this-
- 
- [Van] How could you go out of Cheers? 
- Yeah. And it's like just personally, did you think that? Was it shocking to you? Did you kind of expect it all along? I'm just dying to know what was in your head, you know, at the end of that run. 
- Well, every day was a gift from God, I mean you had to pinch yourself 'cause your job description was, you sit at a bar, crack jokes, and get paid for it. I mean that's, talk about the luckiest people on earth, and then I get a call from John Lasseter 25 years ago saying, Do you wanna play a pig in a cartoon movie? That's it, 25 years now I've been working with Pixar. 
- So, Pixar is the most successful film studio of all time, you are in every Pixar movie. John, are you the most successful actor of all time? 
- Why would you laugh at that? 
- Why you laughin'? 
- [Harvey] I wouldn't laugh at that, John. 
- [Van] I think you've got a solid case my G! 
- I'm just thinking of images of Spencer Tracy and John Malkovich popped up in my head. 
- [Harvey] I mean. 
- Box office-wise I think I'm number three though. 
- Really? 
- Yeah. 
- [Van] Who's one and two? 
- I don't know. 
- Oh I know, Samuel L. Jackson I think is one. 
- Sam's got to be up there, certainly, yeah. 
- Wow, we got a top five star. 
- I know, I'm so excited. 
- Of all time on our show, man. 
- I'm so excited. Hey John, listen, we're thrilled for you. It really is an honor to have you on, and congratulations, it's enormous. So just congratulations on all your success over many, many years.

- Welcome back to TMZ Live, if you showed up for something called Skankfest. 
- That is the name. 
- It's a comedy festival, Skankfest Comedy Mayhem. It's a festival in Brooklyn, you got a big surprise because there was a performer that no one knew was gonna be there, in fact we're told really the organizer. 
- Yeah, that was it. 
- It was the only person who pulled this off, and then announced that, Surprise, Louis C.K. is here. 
- So what kind of reaction do you think he got? I would have anticipated a really strong reaction because in the comedy circuit, he's always gotten that. 
- This is a festival that was just about comedians for three days, so-
- 
- And you know that he-
- 
- If you're there, you're a diehard comedy fan. 
- There were issues that came up with him. 
- When he made a surprise appearance a few months ago. 
- No, no I'm just saying that the backstory of this whole thing. 
- That's the back story of course. 
- Which you probably heard. 
- Louis, you know, masturbating in front of people, and you know he lost-
- 
- He lost a lot of gigs. 
- A lot of gigs, he lost a movie. So, he's been trying he's been doing these appearances every now and then to mixed reactions. So here's what happened. 
- [Announcer] Skankfest is a cool event, right? You never know what can happen. Crazy things can happen. Here's one of those crazy things. Ladies and gentlemen, Louis C.K.! 
- [Crowd] Louis, Louis, Louis, Louis! 
- [Harvey] This went on for a long time. 
- [Charles] Long ovation, and so you can't even say that's mixed, I mean, that is-
- 
- [Harvey] It was not mixed. 
- That is as, it's as full throated an ovation he's gonna get. 
- Yeah, it's a pretty shocking response. I mean it almost sounds like, you know, the audience's favorite team just won a game (laughs) or something like that. 
- [Charles] Well I would say for a lot of people in that crowd, Louis before anything happened, remember, was on top of the comedy world. 
- Right. 
- So this was, you know, for diehard comedy fans, they would've probably been jonesing to see Louis C.K. perform again. That's, I think, why you got that reaction, and I don't know if going forward this will help him, but we're told the people who were there that he actually did open with a joke, or I don't know if it's a joke, but he referred to his-
- 
- Yeah, he opened the set by saying if you ever masturbate in front of someone, ask them first, and if they say yes, 
- Don't do it. 
- don't do it. 
- By the way, I don't know if you saw this, but Roseanne is performing in Atlantic City. 
- Yep, with-
- 
- And the same name. Yeah, that this is again what we talked about with snapshots and whatnot. 
- That you cannot-
- 
- So we'll see. I mean, who was that again? 
- Andrew Dice Clay, yeah. 
- Andrew Dice Clay, that's right. 
- That's an interesting double builder. 
- Hi, this is Sarah Butler from Des Moines, Iowa. 
- Hi Sarah. (laughs) 
- Hey, I think he's doing what he does best, comedy. I mean he may have made a mistake, and done some things some people don't like but gettin' right back into, you know, the business, what he loves to do and what he's good at, and he's good at making people laugh. So, I mean I think he should've gone right back. 
- [Harvey] Yeah, and the audience received him well. 
- It was when they were gonna forgive, and it sounds like it's there. 
- [Harvey] We're gonna take a break. 
- Start the car! Start the car!
