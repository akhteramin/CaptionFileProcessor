- Good morning and welcome to Great Day Washington. I'm Markette Sheppard. Kristen is out today but if you're at home and you're looking for a mate, we've got some great digital dating tips for you this morning. Plus we're sharing how a group of local scientists are working hard to combat the pollution in the Potomac which is so important as we get that storm runoff this morning. But first, let's get over to WUSA9 meteorologist, Howard Bernstein, for an update on this flash flood warning we're currently experiencing, Howard? 
- Yeah, Markette, we've been tracking some very heavy rainfall over the last few hours. It came out of Frederick then moved right down to 70. These are flood warnings from Frederick in towards Southern Prince George's County. So much of the area under active flash flood warnings and these are the worst, most dangerous type of flooding we can have, because flash flooding happens very quickly. It could catch you by surprise and it only takes a foot, two feet of water, to push your car off the road. So that's why you hear turn around, don't drown. The good news is that up in Frederick at least, the heaviest rains are done, but even Howard County now under a flash flood warning 'til 11:45. Montgomery County on the East Side, seeing some heavier rains, but the heaviest rains, and Mary and I were looking at this, some of the precip intensities, the rainfall intensities are in the five plus inches per hour in the heaviest parts, so these are tropical downpours causing some flash flooding. Not everywhere, but there've been a number of water rescues already in Frederick and Montgomery Counties. You see along I-66 and South seems to be the heaviest. Silver Spring, you're starting to see, not quite as heavy rain move in but everywhere you see orange and red, very, very heavy rainfall for Fedex Field right across the heart of D.C. Now moving down toward Alexandria here, just about to Franconia. So our friends down in Mount Vernon and Lowertown and areas of Prince George's County outside the Beltway there. Just generally South of Joint Base Andrews over toward Clinton and Melwood and Upper Marlboro, get ready as this whole mass of water is moving down towards you with that flash flood warning until 11:15, and Prince George's County, and we are gonna see better weather. Once we get rid of this stuff this morning, we'll see the activity shift off to the South and West as we get into the afternoon. So the next one to two hours could be particularly bad with flooding but it will get better this afternoon, Ellen. 
- I hope so 'cause the roads are not looking good right now. This is a live look at the Beltway. We had a closure here. They've just opened a second left lane on the inner loop of the the Beltway by the American Legion Bridge. Let me show you some of the backups because this has been going on for a while. It sounds like there was a tree that fell onto a vehicle, caused some sort of accident. They're trying to move it over to the right hand side as quickly as possible but you can see from that camera, that's what traffic looks like, trying to head around the inner loop of the Beltway. You're jammed coming from the Springfield interchange. This is my maps to show you some of the delays. I-270 southbound, not looking good. The Beltway is not looking good, and I'm also now seeing reports in North Arlington of several flooded streets that we're having some water rescues with. We've had many rescues up in Frederick as well, following Frederick County, their police department's Twitter page. They've been just tweeting out closures like crazy. These are just the main streets, not even the side streets. Definitely impacting you as you head out the door. 
- We got the gold! All right, now to your top headlines this morning. The U.S. Women's Soccer Team, they got quite the welcome last night when they returned to their hotel in France. The U.S. captured its fourth Women's World Cup title in a two to nothing win over the Netherlands. Captain Megan Rapinoe scored the first goal of the match and was named the tournament's outstanding player. New York City Mayor, Bill de Blasio, he invited the players to a ticker tape parade in Manhattan's Canyon of Heroes on Wednesday. Developing this morning, there was panic inside Union Station after loud bangs were mistaken for gunshots. Police are now telling us it appears that this was all just fireworks. The incident happened shortly before five last night, and many people took to social media to document the chaos. One guys said he looked for exit signs and walked out the back of a store with some other customers. Other people said they hid in the storage closets and restrooms until they were given the all clear. 
- It's crazy and we live in a society, not only in America but all across the world, when we hear unexpected sounds, it draws our attention to what could possibly be, and fortunately, unfortunately, it's just the type of times that we live in. It scares people. It scares people because you never know, especially after 9/11. You really never know what's gonna happen. 
- Now the panic caused a stampede. Three people were treated at the scene for minor injuries. When it comes to the person who set off the fireworks, police tell us they are investigating but would not say if someone was arrested. However, with all of those cameras inside and outside, it is likely at this point, they know how this was carried out and who is responsible. Meanwhile, mistaking fireworks for gunshots, this isn't new. Just last week, fireworks sparked a stampede at Navy Pier in Chicago. Police there say a private security officer mistook the sounds of gunfire, as gunfire, and shouted for everyone to take cover. At least 13 people were taken to the hospital after being trampled. Well, in a sweet story this morning, some pictures of a little boy helping out an Honor Guard member in Arlington, Texas, they're going viral. The police department posted the pictures of 11 year old, Josh Brown, tying Officer Wilson's shoe at the 4th of July parade that was held in the city. Wilson noticed his shoe was untied and his fellow officers asked Josh to tie the shoe. Josh said he was a little bit nervous, but he got the job done. The next day, Officer Wilson thanked him for helping out. Josh says he hopes to be a police officer when he grows up. Maryland voters will soon have a new gender option on voter registration forms. Last week, the Board of Elections agreed to list X as a gender option along with M for male and F for female. The change mirrors a new Maryland law for drivers' licenses and state issued ID cards. That law goes into effect on October 1st. We also want to say a big congratulations to the Real Housewives of Potomac star, Ashley Darby. She and her husband, Michael, they welcomed a baby boy into the world yesterday. Ashley Darby posted on Instagram, It was the most sensational day of our shared life. She's yet to reveal the baby boy's name and we are all waiting for that. Congratulations to them. I was her Miss America roommate. I never thought I'd get to announce her first child on air. That's great. Congratulations, Ashley. Now we're gonna send things out to Andi Hauser who is braving the rain this morning out in Alexandria. How are you doing? 
- Hey, good morning to you. I'm doing well. I mean, I'm soaking wet. Originally this morning, we were gonna be out there. We were talking about the Province which is that old tall ship that's now, it has the permanent home here at Founder's Park, but in light of things, since there's so many warnings and watches for flooding in the area, we wanted to go ahead and show you what things are like right here in Alexandria and as you can see, rain is certainly coming down. It's coming down in buckets and of course, there are many streets in this area that are prone to flooding, especially when we were in that flash flood situation. So, already, you know, you can tell there's nobody out here and for good reason. People have gone ahead and either found some shelter. But again guys, it is certainly coming down. We could just see it before it got here. Just that dark line, and it just continued to move closer and closer over the last 30 minutes, which is where we are right now. It seems like we are right in the thick of it here at Founder's Park in Old Town Alexandria. So, I'm gonna step in for a second, dry off a little bit, try and get the drops off my hat. In the meantime, let's send it back to the ladies in the nice dry studio. Back to you.

- Well, welcome back to Great Day Washington. Now we're gonna talk about digital dating in the social age with an author of a book who tried it out for herself, and she wants to save you from some digital disasters. Andi Lew, welcome to Great Day Washington. 
- Thank you, Markette. When I was researching when dating apps first came about. Four years, it took me to research and write this book and I found that from this swipe left culture, people really want meaningful connections and so this is the ultimate dating wellness book because I'm a certified wellness and lifestyle coach. I want you to be able to find love. 
- And people are happier and healthier the research says, when they do have a mate, but how do you do it nowadays when it seems like everything starts out in a digital relationship? You're not meeting people face to face anymore. 
- Well Markette, you know what? It's just so handy. I mean, given on a day like today you want to be indoors or you're a single mom and you just can't get out. We like to do everything from our phone, so why not? However, we need to be careful, as to how we put ourselves on the market in this singles market, because there are some things that you can do, which I explain, to help you have a meaningful connection and something that is safe. 
- Okay, and so to do the research, you actually went undercover for this book. What does that mean? 
- Well most of the time, I didn't tell them who I was, and I wanted to experience dating life as a newly divorced sort of woman in her 40s and how it's so hard to navigate through this world of digital dating. It's hard to keep up, and I wanted to be able to help others. But other times, I did say, Listen, I'm just an author and I'm researching. And a lot of the people would reply back and say, Oh, that's a really good line. I'm gonna use that line. I said, No, I really am. 
- [Markette] And so they still wanted to go out with you? So when you say them, you mean you were dating men and interacting with men for the book? 
- [Andi] Yes. 
- But sometimes you told them you were doing research and sometimes you just, and what was the barometer? If you were interested maybe you didn't tell them? 
- Well, what I did was I kinda said, Look, this really is research. Tell me about your experience because I would love to write about it and help other people. And they said, Well, can we go on a date first? And then can I be in the book? And I said, Honey, you already are. I've been screenshotting everything. 
- Wow, okay. 
- So there's some great stories in there but I did cover up their identity with a bit of a cowboy emoji or something like that. 
- Okay, so it's anonymous. Now, nowadays, everybody if they're interested, they wanna like slide someone a DM. 
- Yeah. 
- And you say those days are done. Can you explain? 
- Well look, people are going into direct messages on Instagram as well as dating apps. You don't need to court via a dating app. It can be actually through any sort of social media and I wanted to explain the correct netiquette, if you like, on how to do that. 
- Okay, internet etiquette? 
- Yeah, that's right. 
- Okay, so you're saying you don't need to sign up on a proper dating app to date anymore. You can use any social media platform, but you have some rules of engagement. 
- Well, that's right. First of all, people are getting others' attention by going on, what I call, a liking spree. So on Instagram, for example, they'll like a couple of the photos at the top and then maybe scroll down to sort of a month prior, and then a bit of a follow. And that kinda gets your attention, I guess, when it comes up in the notifications in your newsfeed. And if you like the look of the person, then you might slide into their DMs, and then a conversation begins. 
- Okay, so go on a, so you, do you recommend this? Go on a liking spree, do a nice comment and follow, and then it comes up, like, this person's name like 10 times and you're-
- 
- Well, not 10 times Markette, 'cause then you're gonna look like a crazy person. 
- Right? That's why I'm asking if you would recommend it. 
- That's right. 
- Okay. 
- So I'd probably recommend about two to three times and a follow. And then-
- 
- You said spree. So a spree is two to three likes. 
- Yeah, a liking spree is two to three. That's a healthy way, and you know what? It's healthy to flirt, and to do it safely and with the right netiquette, if you like, is the best way. 
- Okay, that's good. So not all attempts at digital dating go according to plan as we know in real life face to face dating. So, how do you avoid the disasters? Or you do, maybe you're not a weirdo or a crazy, but you come across as one because you liked too many photos. 
- That's why you need my book. 
- Right, right. 
- Because there is a chapter called, How to Weed Out the Weirdos. Are they weird or are they just socially awkward? I mean, this didn't come with a book of rules, so I wrote one, and it's important to know sort of how you are coming across as you say, and there are ways to come across, you know, really authentic and kind, and things like that, and you can have a very, you know, people are getting married out of these sorts of dating apps. So it's important to know that if you present well, then you'll attract well. 
- Okay, you said a good tip before. We have to go to break, but I just wanna share. You said if you see someone on Instagram and you like them, try to do, like, a Facetime or a Skype right away. 
- Good, yeah. 
- To make sure, and then you have a book launch event in town. Can you tell folks about it? 
- Yeah, that's right. So basically I'd love you to follow me on Instagram, and you can see all the details. Also, you do need to bring it to a video call because then you can see if they're a fake person or a real person, but learn how to block their number as well when you do do a video call. 
- All right. Thank you so much, Andi Lew. The book is called, #InstaLovers: Digital Dating, DM Disasters and Love Stories. 
- And it's on Amazon. 
- And it's on Amazon! We'll be back with more Great Day after this. Thank you.

- Hey, welcome back to Great Day Washington. This morning, we are coming to you live from Old Town Harbor, where the rain is coming down, but I wanted to tell you, earlier this week, we had a chance to catch up with the folks from the River, Potomac Riverkeepers Foundation, and when it comes to water quality after a major weather event like this, things are gonna be compromised, so here's what you need to know. Check it out. 
- We have our annual report. 
- Thank you. 
- [Woman] If you'd like to grab one. 
- [Andi] One by one, volunteers signed up here at the National Harbor. 
- We just felt that it was really important that the public had an opportunity to know when the water was safe to go in. 
- [Andi] To learn how they can help heal the waters of the Potomac River. 
- We are launching our Virginia and Maryland Citizen Science Volunteer Water Quality Monitoring Program, Educating them about where sources of bacteria are coming from, how they get into the river, and the public health risks where people go in the river and don't know when it's safe to go in the water or not. 
- [Andi] Dean Naujoks from the Potomac River Keeper Network helped launch this program because there was little to no data recorded on the bacteria found in the Potomac. 
- [Dean] Rule of thumb is one to three days after a rain event, usually you will have high levels of bacteria. 
- That bacteria comes from backed up sewage and storm drains that spill into the river. Is there a specific type of bacteria that we're looking for? 
- That's right. It's E. coli. That's the main test we're using. The reason we use E. Coli is it's somewhat correlated with human health issues. From what I understand, that's why there is a swimming ban in the D.C. waters. 
- [Andi] Patrick Fletcher is a volunteer scientist with the Potomac Riverkeeper Network and donates his time to help collect data. He showed us the process. 
- [Patrick] I'm gonna just scoop this in like that, fill it up. Now we have a clean sample of the Potomac right here. 
- [Andi] They also test the turbidity or clarity of the water and the pH levels. We don't have to go far to process the data. The Sea Dog, a boat donated to the Potomac Riverkeepers serves as a live working science lab right on the water. 
- [Patrick] So if it's fluorescent, it means that there, it's positive for E. coli. 
- [Andi] The Riverkeepers then compare the numbers to a chart to determine if the sample is a pass or a fail. 
- [Patrick] In the D.C. region, we're using a conservative cut off of 126, so this would be a fail. 
- All the data collected by the volunteers can be downloaded to your phone by using the Swim Guide app. The goal is to let us know if the water is safe for a variety of activities. 
- We're gonna be uploading it here every single week on Fridays, so that when people are going out on the weekends during warm weather months, September through October, they know based on that data that we took that day, whether the water is safe or not to swim. A swimmable Potomac River is the goal. 
- [Andi] Currently, there are 10 test sites along the river, but Dean is optimistic there will be more as the program grows. His hope is that this program pushes out the pollution problem in the Potomac. 
- We're seeing important things happening, like upgrades to sewage treatment plants. 
- [Andi] After all, it's about keeping the water clean for generations to come. 
- [Dean] I can honestly say that this river is gonna be cleaner probably in 10 years from now than it is now. 
- All right, guys. If you want more information, you can log on to WUSA9.com but again, I'm out here in Alexandria this morning. We're actually at Old Town Harbor. You can really feel the dock moving. It seems like the wind's even picking up a little bit but the rain, definitely coming down. So as you heard there in the story, you're gonna wanna allow three or four days for the bacteria levels and E. coli levels to possibly drop in the river before going into it, or utilizing it in any way. Let's send it back to the ladies in the studio. 
- [Announcer] We're going gaga for gazpacho in the Great Day Kitchen. Coming up, find out where you can get the summer dish all month long. 
- Flooding rains continue across Washington and Point South now. New flash flood warnings for D.C. until 11:15, that also goes with south toward Prince George's County. Some of the rainfall rates here, three, four, five inches per hour. We'll take a closer look at radar and let you know what you can expect for the rest of your Monday and the week, in just a couple of minutes.

- [Announcer] Get live TV, great apps and on demand from Cox starting at $79.99 a month. 
- Hi friends. Do you know what I don't like? Liars. Insurance company liars. Insurance company adjusters who avoid your calls, rarely call you back, who stall, delay and do everything they can to frustrate you in connection with your accident claim. And then, they offer you a ridiculously insulting amount of money while telling you the bills were too high, that you didn't need all of that treatment, and that you really weren't hurt that badly. So what can you do? The system is not set up, unfortunately, in a way that allows you to do much. You can't file a lawsuit and push them, but a lawyer can. I'm attorney Paul Samakow, and the antics of the insurance industry really piss me off. So when I represent you, if I don't get what I want for you, lawsuit. Call one of my five million numbers if you've been injured. An attorney will answer. That's right, an attorney will answer your call. 
- Into the afternoon. If you see high water and you don't know if the road is there, assume it is not. It's just very dangerous. Now, the future cast. I do wanna point out, I think this is about 20 or 30 miles too far North because it's got the rain still in Montgomery County, but we've seen the heaviest down here so, assume this is just a little bit too far North but even at 11:30, we still have some heavier rains, potentially coming in to the South Side of DC. The nice thing is, the trend shows the rain moving south and then southwest as we get into the afternoon. So through the morning, we still have a threat for some heavy tropical downpours but then in the afternoon, we'll see some sun as we dry out with highs staying in the 70s to low 80s. Much more comfortable out there, but a dangerous situation at the moment. Scattered showers and storms this morning. Some of them heavy, heavy rain, so please watch out for the high water. Mostly in the-
- 
- Then it must be good. 
- Yeah, yeah. Totally, yeah. 
- Right. 
- So it's about, like raw vegetables, so basically it's like a vegetable smoothie. Gazpacho, the base of it, is tomato usually, traditionally in Spain, but we're gonna play with that to base on what's in season. So right now, we're gonna do green chickpea and cucumber gazpacho is what we're gonna make. 
- Oh, this is nice. This is really-
- 
- Yes, it's super healthy. Green chickpea? 
- It's not dairy free though so. 
- Right. It's not dairy free but yogurt is one of those foods where they're on the health food list as something that-
- 
- Exactly. That you can eat. 
- It's good for you. 
- It's full fat Greek yogurt. It's not low fat which is the best. 
- Full fat? 
- Full fat. 
- [Markette] Okay, there you go. 
- Don't go for the low cal stuff. 
- These green chickpeas look amazing. 
- Yeah, so they're fresh green chickpeas. 
- They're one of my favorite foods, but this is the type of summer soup that they eat along the Mediterranean, so that's Spain and-
- 
- Yeah, that, so it's the southern part of the inner Lucia region, is like where gazpacho kinda started. 
- Okay. 
- So obviously, tomato is a base but, I mean, we have the grilled local peach, piquillo pepper. 
- So this is another. 
- Gazpacho. So you have four different, so it's a different gazpacho each week, and this one is made from Virginia peaches. 
- So local Virginia peaches, grilled and then we puree it with piquillo peppers. 
- [Markette] That's beautiful, what's this? 
- [Matt] And then yellow tomato, and yellow watermelon gazpacho. 
- [Markette] Yellow, I've never seen a yellow watermelon. Our camera is slowly panning there. 
- [Matt] This is the hybridized watermelon. It's super sweet, it's delicious. 
- [Markette] Any different tastes or? 
- [Matt] It's a little more sweeter, I feel like it is. 
- [Markette] Oh really? Oh. 
- [Matt] Yeah, and they kind of, there's tomato in that, so it kind of balances out. 
- Okay, beautiful. 
- There's acid. There's sweetness so it's nice. 
- Okay. Let's get back to this one. 
- So let's dig in. So you got, we got the red, we got the yellow, now we're making the green. 
- And the green, exactly. 
- Gazpacho, okay. I wanna go every week, just to say I had a healthy meal at least once a week, Chef Matt. 
- All right, so high protein. You got the avocados. 
- Okay. 
- All right. Lemon juice, lemon zest. 
- Nice little twang there. 
- Little bit of sherry vinegar for a little more acid, which is so good. All right, so what binds it is the avocado, the cheese, and the yogurt. So you don't have to put any bread into it. 
- That's nice. 
- So it will not, it will not separate. And there's no crazy food chemicals in it as well. 
- [Markette] Oh, that's so great. And then the bread helps you stay slim and trim and light in summer as well. 
- Exactly. 
- [Markette] But full because of the chickpeas. 
- [Matt] Exactly. So jalapenos, because everybody likes spicy food in the summertime. Fresh mint, and obviously a lot of green herbs to make it green, and then basil. And then water to thin it out, to get whatever consistency you want. You can add more or less water. So fresh still water 'cause it won't effect the flavor. It's nice and neutral. There's no chlorine or any chemicals or whatever in it. 
- [Markette] Ah, okay. So that's why you use that. 
- [Matt] Yes, it won't affect the flavor at all. 
- [Markette] So we're stirring this up on TV, but at home if you were to attempt this, what would you use? 
- [Matt] So at home, you would use a blender, obviously to puree it, and then if you want it chunky or smooth, you can pass it through a china cap or a chinois to get it whatever texture you want, but it's open ended. You can eat it like this if you want. (laughs) 
- [Markette] Uh, okay no thank you. I'll just keep stirring this and as you continue. Okay, so imagine. 
- It's like yogurt soup. 
- [Markette] Imagine you have a blender and all of these ingredients, get nice and smooth with no lumps, like you chefs do so well. How would it look when you finally plate it? 
- [Matt] So, we're gonna plate it. This is how we do at the restaurant. A little bit of tzatziki, so dill, cucumber, Greek yogurt, and if you want, you can do the rest gluten-free. I like a little breadcrumbs for texture. 
- Just a little. 
- Just a little bit. 
- [Markette] And it's also very beautiful on the plate. 
- [Matt] All right, a lot of olive oil, 'cause they're Mediterranean, they love olive oil and olives, and then pour tableside. Nice and smooth, see that little texture to it. 
- [Markette] Oh, so that's nice. So the waiter comes out and pours it? 
- [Matt] Yeah, we pour it tableside. 
- [Markette] At your seat, I love when they do that. 
- [Matt] And I'll put some more olive oil on, 'cause olive oil is really good. And that's it. 
- [Markette] All right, that's beautiful. Now, I would probably do this. I love breadcrumbs, could you do that? 
- [Matt] Yeah, you can do whatever you want. 
- Just like a little. 
- Yeah. 
- And then like a little? 
- Little bit of microgreens. 
- [Markette] Yeah exactly, 'cause then I can say that I ate my vegetables, and no one knows it's a tablespoon full. Now what's great about Olivia, is you have this torta de gazpacho or gazpacho de torta, depending on which order you eat it. So if the soup is just not enough, you have something more. 
- Yeah, so it's similar to a combo plate. For 16 bucks you can come in, and get whatever weekly gazpacho we have, little village salad, and a little burrata sandwich. 
- That looks so amazing. 
- Little bit of pan-cooked tomate on the bottom. 
- Wow, so the burrata's like nice and soft, and then you squeeze it and then. 
- Yeah, it just oozes out. 
- It just oozes out all over. Can y'all see that at home? Okay, I'm gonna leave it here, but look at that burrata. And then you squeeze it when you bite into it, and you're like, it's the best meal I ever had in my life! Okay, so four different gazpachos. One each week, where do we find you for more? 
- So 800 F Street Northwest. 
- 800 F Street. 
- So Penn Quarter and not Chinatown, where Penn Quarter is.

- [Woman] Who's that? He is wobbling and weaving, wobbling around. That would not be the morning to be out sightseeing. 
- Systems when you can get the ease and, all right, sorry about that. We'll get back to Howard in just a minute, but for now we're talking Michael and Son. When it comes to keeping systems up in your home, you can get the ease and convenience of leasing with Michael and Son. Here to tell us more about their leasing programs is proud son and, sorry about that I'm blanking here. Sorry, proud son and owner of Michael and Son. Welcome back, Basim Mansour. 
- Are we live? 
- We are live on TV right now. 
- Oh, wonderful. 
- I know. You didn't know, we came quickly. There was no teleprompter for me to read, but we are here to talk about home ownership, and how leasing an HVAC system is so convenient and easy. Tell me more. 
- Well, traditionally everybody normally has HVAC systems in their home and they buy them when they go bad. We have a new product, and it's called a Lease Hassle-Free Lease Program, and with that it means that you don't own your HVAC system. Why own an asset that's gonna fail and it's gonna die over a period time? Why own a problem? Why own a maintenance issue? Lease it. 
- And a lot of people don't know that they can lease their system. This is like you said, hassle-free. Tell me more about what makes it hassle-free. 
- What makes it hassle-free is the fact that you don't have to think about it. We take care of all the maintenance. We take care of the filter changes. We take care of tuning it up before the seasons. We take care of any repairs. Listen, the truth is, everything's gonna fail. These systems are gonna fail. Everything in life fails, and when they do fail, we'll take care of it. I mean, that's the thing, and it's not gonna hurt you. You're not gonna feel the pain of thinking, oh my god, what's this gonna cost? It's covered, it's taken care of. 
- That's true, because no one wants to spend their money, although you need it, no one wants to spend their money buying a new HVAC system. How much can people really save by leasing, especially when you think about your five to seven years on a system, it's working hard in the summer. 
- Oh yeah, well you know what? Actually I'll tell you a very quick story. I was talking to an elderly lady, and I was thinking about her, and I was thinking she was on the fence whether to lease or to buy, and I said, Listen. I said, I want you to lease and I'll tell you why, because if I lease it to you, I know that you're gonna be covered for the rest of your life, that no one's gonna take advantage of you, that we're always gonna take care of your system, that no person's gonna come in and not do you right with the repairs. And when you lease it, you know you're covered, and that's what you're gonna get. You're gonna get security, you're gonna get the knowing that you don't have to think about it. You're gonna get the fact that you don't have to schedule maintenances, we do that, you know? 
- When you talk about someone on a fixed income, like a senior citizen, who maybe doesn't have the wherewithal to go out and actually shop for an HVAC system, you also offer a convenient monthly price, so people know what to expect, and know you're gonna be there for them, but then they also know what to expect from month to month. 
- Absolutely. The thing is, when you buy a system, and if you were to buy that, right? You think about, you're gonna buy it, but what you don't think about is all the repairs and the maintenance over the life of the unit. If you were to take the repairs and the maintenances, plus the cost of equipment, that's a monthly cost, because those systems are only gonna last 10 or 15 years. So, we're just taking that, and just combining into one fixed payment where you're guaranteed you're not gonna have surprises. 
- I love this, especially for new homeowners. You think about the elderly people, but then first time homebuyers, they can be overwhelmed with everything they have to do for a new home. So it makes sense, now but what happens when you sell your home, and you're thinking, oh my goodness, I leased this HVAC. How can I transfer it? Can I transfer it at all? 
- Great question and the answer is yes, you can transfer it, and I think honestly, any new homeowner that buys your home is gonna be thankful that they're just gonna go into a system that they don't have to worry about, because lots of people who buy homes, sometimes it's their first home, and they're not sure what to do. With this, they don't have to do nothing. 
- I love it, I love it. I know that was definitely me when I bought my first home. All I wanted to do was turn the lights on, have it be cool in the summer, and hot in the winter, or at least warm. Okay, so we got that covered. Now do you have any type of specials for our Great Day viewers? Maybe you're interested and you need a little push at home, so we got the owner of Michael and Son here, and I'm saying, what do you have for our homeowners watching? 
- Well, I'll tell you this. I don't want to sound too infomercially, but I will say that I want you guys to really get into this. I want you to enjoy your summer, and if you guys honestly, call us and call us now, we're gonna give you three, the first three months of payments are on me. 
- I love that, I love it. So the first three, you don't even have to talk to Basim himself, just call, get the first person who answers and says, I saw Basim on Great Day and you get the first three months. 
- Yes. 
- I'm repeating this now, so people will call me, you get the first three months on you. 
- Absolutely, and if you want, you can call me. This is my personal cellphone number right here. No, it's not here. I'm just joking. 
- Okay, 866. Okay, okay, but that's your number, and I just so appreciate you making it easy, because no one really knows an HVAC system unless you're an HVAC expert, and that's you. So I appreciate you coming here today. 
- I appreciate you having me. 
- And you did great for live unexpected TV. You did great. 
- Thank you. 
- Yeah okay, so remember for the deal, you have to call, so remember call about Michael and Son's leasing options and they're standing by to take your calls right now. That number is 866-214-8608, or you can visit them online at MichaelandSon.com, now let's send it over to Howard for an update on the weather. 
- Yeah, you know Markette, these batteries only last so long. They're been on since 4:15 this morning, but we're continuing to track the storms. Heaviest stuff now is pushing from D.C. south, although we're not done with the rain, but I think the heaviest rains if you are north of D.C. you probably have the worst you're gonna see, and there's plenty of flooding going on right now. Ellen's got some incredible pictures she's gonna share in just a moment, but on the doppler you'll notice D.C. south we're seeing the heaviest stuff. Flood warnings now go into Prince George's County 'til one o'clock in advance of this mass of water that is coming out of the Alexandria, Clinton, Upper Marlboro, the Southern part of the District, over toward even Northern Anne Arundel, Northern Calvert and Southern Anne Arundel Counties. You see D.C. now, we're out of the heaviest, heaviest stuff, at least in the heart of downtown. Alexandria down toward Mount Vernon, Accokeek still getting pounded there with just lighter, more regular rains if you will, back toward Georgetown, Northwest D.C., Bethesda, Potomac. West Springfield to Mount Vernon as we said to Piscataway in Prince George's County. And the heavy rains have made it to Brandywine, it's gonna get a little bit heavier. Waldorf, it'll be there in the next 10 or 15 minutes, and we'll give it another 10 or 15 minutes after that. As this whole area's moving southeast at about 25 miles a hour or so. Charles County, eventually into Calvert and St. Mary's as well, and let's not forget west of the river. Our friends in Prince William not seeing it nearly as badly, and I think that'll be the same case in Stafford. Some of these rain totals by the way, that's close to five inches in the last 12 hours. These are 12 hour rain totals in Frederick, I saw a picture out of Baker Park underwater. We saw some areas north of Martinsburg, five and a half inches of rain since last night. Adamstown had about four and a half, four and three quarters since last night. So we've had widespread flooding, please be careful, take all of these closed roads very seriously. What are we looking at for the next 12 hours? Well, still a chance for some rain and showers I think through early afternoon, slip south and west, we dry out. We see a little sun, but a cooler day than we've seen in awhile with highs in the lower 80s. Ellen Brian, unbelievable. 
- Howard. 
- [Howard] You showed me that map of the Beltway, it's almost completely red. 
- [Ellen] Oh yes, yeah. I can go to that first here, let's show you that. The I-270 Southbound, the Beltway, inner and outer loops, especially over by the American Legion Bridge, because that is where we're seeing that first traffic lane camera that I'm showing you now. We had a closure here. No longer a closure, but take a look at traffic that is following that. We had a tree that fell down on a car, caused an accident, so we're seeing these significant delays. Plus the rain's delaying people. Flooding on so many roads. This is right here, Lee Highway at North Kirkwood Street. If you can look closely through, I know the raindrops on that camera lens, there are cars that have been trapped in high water there. We've also been getting people on social media sending us so many things, including some flooding in Metro as well, and the entrance that has been blocked to the C&O Canal, so we'll see. Oh, we have Adam Longo first. Okay, so Adam Longo, he was up by Newcut Road and 355, or Frederick Road. Take a look at the flooding there. There's that car. 
- Clarksburg, Clarksburg area. 
- [Ellen] It's in Clarksburg area, Montgomery County. That car that's over by the guardrail as you're seeing that, and Howard and I were talking about this. You typically see this area have that kind of high water. 
- [Howard] Yeah, just south of the middle school. I live a mile or so north of there, so this is a very low area on 355. 
- [Ellen] Yeah, Adam's saying the road's completely washed out. Then we have trouble at the Metro, take a look at this. This is the Virginia Square Metro, do you see the water that's rushing right into the tracks from above? It's just coming down. This is from a viewer, Nina Farah sent this in. She said, I think I'm gonna be late to work, is what she said with this, I think so, and she has many other tweets that she's been sending out, but water rushing in there, and then also the C&O Canal tweeted out this. They said their Great Falls entrance, the road there is completely closed. They have trees that are down. I've seen pictures of high water there as well, so we're seeing this all over. You gotta be careful out there. So many swift water rescues happening. Be careful out there this morning. We're gonna take a quick break, then we'll come right back here and continue our coverage.

- Well, welcome back to Great Day Washington. It's what everyone is talking about this morning, besides the storm, it's the Women's World Cup. The U.S. Women's Team is back on top after beating the Netherlands two to nothing yesterday in France. It's the fourth World Cup title for the U.S. and the second in a row. Let's go to the highlights. Now the game went into half scoreless, but in the second half, who else but Megan Rapinoe got the U.S. on board, scoring easily on a penalty kick, then about six minutes later, Rose Lavelle scored a beautiful goal to give the U.S. the two to nothing lead. Lavelle plays for the Washington Spirit in the National Women's Soccer League. It was her third goal of the World Cup. The goal also helped the U.S. break a record for most goals by one team in a Women's World Cup, with 26 goals. And from there, the party was on. Megan Rapinoe won the Golden Boot for most goals in the World Cup. She's just the second American to ever win the award. Her teammate Alex Morgan won the Silver Boot for the second most goals. And you'll remember during the tournament, Megan Rapinoe sparked some controversy saying she and the team would not visit the White House if they won. Right now it's unclear if they'll even be invited, but President Trump did tweet, Congratulations to the U.S. Women's Soccer Team on winning the World Cup. Great and exciting play, America is proud of you all. But he stopped short of saying if they'd be invited to the White House. Well either way, we know the team will be honored with a ticker tape parade in New York City on Wednesday. One out of two isn't bad ether. Earlier, we told you about the U.S. Women's Team winning the World Cup, but the Men's Team wasn't so lucky last night. They lost one to nothing in the Gold Cup Final in Chicago. The Gold Cup features teams from North America, Central America, and the Caribbean. The game was scoreless until the 73rd minute when Mexico's Jonathan Dos Santos scored to give Mexico the lead. This is Mexico's eighth Gold Cup Championship. Great Day Washington will be right back after this.

- Welcome back, we want to update you on what's going on with the weather here this morning, because we've had lots of flooding across the region from Frederick to Howard, to Montgomery Counties, now into D.C. And the heaviest rains are moving south into Southern Prince George's, Charles County, eventually Calvert and St. Mary's. I think Virginia, west of the Potomac, not looking nearly as bad, but we still have some rainfall rates in Alexandria and Clinton, over to Waldorf here, into Northern Charles County. Some of these rainfall rates are three, four, five inches per hour. That'd be the instantaneous rate, but you're able to pick up a quick one to two, three inches of rain, and that's why we've got the flash flooding and all of these flash flood warnings. You'll notice once we get to Alexandria, north of there, it's not as bad. Still some moderate showers across the eastern half of D.C. with the heaviest stuff south of Morningside. We're gonna take awhile before the water actually recedes. So the heaviest rains now in Vernon, Piscataway, Brandywine, now down toward Waldorf into Charles County. Continuing to move to the southeast, so our friends in Calvert, Charles County, get ready. The Charles and Prince George's warning, the southern Prince George's, that one goes until one o'clock this afternoon. The good news is, well, we've had some rainfall rates, or rainfall actually observed over five inches in the last 12 hours, the afternoon looks better. We will dry out with highs in the low 80s. Have a great Monday.
