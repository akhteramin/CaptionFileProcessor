- [Zo] Right now at 11:00 heavy rain and strong winds across the Washington area tonight knocking down trees and knocking out power. These storms were intense so let's find out if we're in the clear. Meteorologist, Melissa Nord, is here with me now and, Melissa, I have a feeling the answer is no. 
- Well, you're guessing right. Mother Nature's storm game is still going strong at 11 o'clock tonight. You can see the progression of the storms over the last five hours and just in the last hour tracking another intense thunderstorm that's over Southern Maryland, stretching through Charles County and now moving into St. Mary's County, Mechanicsville, with a lot of heavy rain and about 20 lightening strikes in the last 10 minutes alone. So this is our one last storm of the night. Moving towards Lexington Park, 11:36 and if it holds together, Ridge, Maryland by about midnight tonight. Now tomorrow we have another round of storms so let's talk about storm threats. Now tomorrow I think the greater overall threat is gonna end up being just some very heavy rain falling on saturated ground that could lead to flooding. We're gonna see lightening and I think we could also see an isolated storm become strong or severe, maybe not as many as we saw today, but the storms tomorrow will still be intense. We'll start the morning with patchy fog. Let' take Futurecast out to noon. You're still noticing we're mostly dry on Futurecast, but starting in the afternoon that next round of storms starts firing up and, Zo, once it starts going it's gonna get only more intense from there. We'll take you through the rest of the Futurecast. We're gonna look ahead into when we'll see our next streak of dry days next. 
- [Zo] That's what I wanna hear. All right, thank you Melissa. And this should come as no surprise, the storms left behind a lot of damage in our area tonight. Check out this huge tree that may have brushed against this house along Reservoir Road in Northwest D.C. right before falling over. There's no word of any injuries tonight. And in Glover Park more damage. This tree snapped and fell right onto that parked SUV. Some of those other cars nearby may have been damaged as well. And check this out, also in the district yet another tree crashes onto a car. You can't even really see the car because that tree is so big there. This happened along Upshur Street and New Hampshire Avenue. And here's a look at more weather pictures coming in tonight from our WUSA9 team throughout the region. These are just spectacular. Look at this, because of the intensity of this storm again which you can gauge from these images alone, many people are without power tonight especially in Prince George's County, hundreds of people there without power. Well, if you have pictures or video you'd like to send our way you can tag us, WUSA9 on Facebook or Twitter and we'll share them here. Well, before the storms rolled in tonight police responded to a deadly motorcycle crash in Montgomery County. This happened in Gaithersburg just off of 270 at the intersection of 370 and Route 200. Police tell us a 45-year-old man crashed there tonight. Well, it has certainly been a tense day and night in Washington. Right and left wing protestors, they faced off near the White House today. One side demanding free speech, the other, speech free of hate. Here's Jess Arnold. 
- [Protestors] Build that wall. 
- [Protestors] Black Lives Matter. 
- [Jess] Right wing ralliers, and counter protestors in downtown D.C. Saturday. 
- My biggest issue is the fact that Trump is trying to divide people. 
- I respect your conviction. 
- [Man] Yes. 
- [Jess] From MAGA-hat wearers to the Neo-fascist group, Proud Boys, the right rally to defend free speech after they say sites like Twitter and Facebook censored some of them. 
- [Woman] Will they take away our right to Tweet, take away our right to share photos, take away our right to share our peace of mind. They take away our right to do rallies like this, so. 
- [Jess] Across the street groups like, Black Lives Matter, Sanctuary DMV, and other activists joined under the banner, AllOUTDC, to protest hate in Pershing Park. 
- We're over here showing that, you know, even in the face of white supremacy and hate that we still are working towards liberation. 
- [Jess] Some clashes were inevitable. 
- Do not touch me. 
- Abraham Lincoln (mic not picking up voice). 
- It's not the party of Abraham Lincoln anymore. 
- Yes it is. It is the party of (mumbles). 
- These big tech companies they lie and they call us Nazi's, they call us terrible people, they say all conservatives are evil and racist. To these Antifa people over there have the complete wrong idea. These Antifa people should be on our side. If they're against fascism they should be against censoring voices. 
- [Jess] Those for and against the President had no problem raising their voices Saturday. 
- I support Donald Trump because of the urban revitalization, tax cuts, prison reform, second-chance hiring, that helps a black community a lot. 
- I'm really ashamed of a lot of the things that are going on in the country and I think it's really important for everybody to speak out. 
- [Man] Our street. 
- [Together] Our street. 
- [Jess] Jess Arnold, WUSA9. 
- [Zo] Also tonight, still can't get over these pictures right here. Crews, they finally removed that red minivan that was swallowed up by this massive sink hole in Northern Virginia earlier this week. This took place along Princedale Drive in Woodbridge on the Fourth of July. Thankfully that was just parked and no one was inside at the time. The Virginia Department of Transportation is blaming a stormwater pipe that burst because of all the rain we've been getting lately. While the van is now out VDOT says it will take weeks to repair this section of Princedale Drive so it will remain closed. And new details tonight on a single-car crash that shut down parts of I-95 in Spotsylvania County yesterday. Some of you may have been caught up in this at the end of the workday. We're now told a 2004 Ford Explorer was traveling north on I-95 when the driver ran off the right shoulder and overturned several times before coming to a rest on the left shoulder. The driver, 24-year-old, Jahvante Winnagle, from West Virginia, was taken to a nearby hospital with life-threatening injuries, but the news is more grim for some of his passengers. A passenger in that Ford, 47-year-old, Frederick Thomas, was ejected and died at the scene. Thomas was not wearing a seatbelt. Another passenger, Robert Rutherford, was also killed. Now two other passengers in that car with them were transported to Mary Washington Hospital with minor injuries. Both of those passengers were wearing seat belts. A suspected gas explosion in Florida today reduced parts of a shopping mall to rubble. That blast was massive. At least 21 people were hurt. This happened in Plantation, Florida west of Fort Lauderdale. Here's, Peter King. 
- [Peter] The blast originated inside a vacant pizza restaurant destroying it and sending debris flying across this shopping center in Plantation, Florida. Falling debris crushed several cars in the parking lot. 
- I heard a loud, boom, and really thought it was fireworks. 
- [Peter] The force of the blast shattered windows and damaged businesses in the same section of the plaza including an L.A. Fitness Center. People inside the gym said the entire building shook. It's roof collapsed, patrons were sent scrambling to get out. 
- My first initial instinct was, was this an earthquake, but I was like, I'm in Florida so obviously it's not an earthquake. I was just terrified honestly. 
- [Peter] The explosion was powerful enough to be felt for miles around. 
- When we arrived we found patients scattered all about the debris area. 
- [Peter] First responders set up a triage area and firefighters with specially trained dogs searched the area to make sure no one was trapped or killed. Fire officials say everyone has been accounted for. 
- We're very much relieved, that considering the debris field, and considering how we found the patients and where we found 'em, that the injuries are not as severe as we would have thought they would be. So we're very thankful for that. 
- [Peter] Peter King, CBS News, Orlando. 
- [Zo] President Trump doubling down on his fight to add a controversial question about citizenship to the 2020 census. Nicole Killian is traveling with the President tonight and she's in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey. 
- [Nicole] President Trump flew to New Jersey for his first summer visit to his country club. While back in Washington aides scrambled to find a way to get a citizenship question included in the 2020 census despite pushback from the Supreme Court. 
- We have four or five ways we could do it so we're working on a lot of things including an executive order. 
- [Nicole] A source familiar with the deliberations tells CBS News attorneys are reviewing all the options and are trying to resolve the legal issues as quickly as possible. Critics charge the citizenship question discriminates against immigrants and communities of color. 
- We're gonna lose a lot of support for the, our communities in our regions. Experts say the President can't override the Supreme Courts decision to block the question, but he can come up with a new rationale for why it's warranted. 
- The Commerce Secretary can add some questions to the census if there are valid reasons to do so. 
- [Nicole] The President also wants action on immigration. After postponing mass deportation roundups last month he's threatening they'll start fairly soon. 
- I don't call 'em raids, I say they came in illegally and we're bringing 'em out legally. 
- [Nicole] The administration continues to come under fire for poor conditions at migrant detention centers along the Southern border. 
- President Trump claims the facilities are clean and run beautifully, but a government watch dog report described the crisis as a ticking time bomb. House Democrats plan a hearing next week. Nicole Killian, CBS News, Berkeley Heights, New Jersey. 
- [Zo] Still ahead here tonight if you like burgers you're gonna wanna hear about some of the tastiest burgers in the nation and find out why they're being cooked up for a good cause.

- Aw man, this is what people are dealing with out West tonight. We are learning about a strong earthquake that jolted the Los Angeles area last night just a day after a slightly weaker one rattled Southern California. The magnitude 7.1 earthquake's epicenter is near Ridgecrest where a rock slide has shut down a road. It also triggered a number of fires. Here's, Joy Benedict, in Pasadena. 
- [Joy] The magnitude 7.1 earthquake hit just one day after Thursdays 6.4 jolt. 
- There were a number of structure fires, there were gas leaks, there was road damage, rock slides. 
- [Joy] This was the scene inside a market in Ridgecrest, the city near the epicenter of the quakes. Food and other items flew off the shelves. 
- This is a very strong earthquake. 
- [Joy] About 150 miles to the Southwest our CBS colleagues in Los Angeles felt the earthquake Friday night while they were broadcasting. 
- We'll be right back. 
- Wow. 
- [Joy] And at the Dodgers home game. 
- Suddenly like something started shaking and we're like looking around and all of a sudden everyone's like, whoa. 
- [Joy] But the baseball game continued. The earthquake even rattled Los Vegas with enough force to stop this NBA game. Thousands of earthquakes have struck Southern California here in the last couple of days so scientists here at Cal Tech are crunching the numbers trying to figure out the probability of more. 
- We're concerned about future aftershocks and where they're gonna be. 
- [Joy] Seismologists say the likelihood of another magnitude six quake over the next week is more than 25%. Joy Benedict, CBS News, Pasadena, California. 
- And Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for a section of Southern California that saw significant damage after Friday night's earthquake. All right I wanna bring in meteorologist, Melissa Nord, again with us tonight because it's been a busy night storm wise-
- 
- Yep. 
- And it's still not over. 
- It's not over quite yet. 
- Okay. 
- We've got one storm that is left out there, but we get-
- 
- Just one. 
- To do it all again tomorrow. 
- Rinse and repeat, right? 
- As if you were not done with it already. Here we go, look at the tower cam, nice and dry over D.C. right now. I don't remember if I mentioned this a couple minutes ago, our wind gusts at Reagan National, as the storms were coming through, was just about 40 miles an hour, but at the Capitol it gusted to 66. That's why there's dozens, I'm not kidding, 66 at the U.S. Capitol. It's not, but in terms of a, it can happen, we'll just leave it there. There were dozens of trees down all over D.C. At one point we had about 5,000 people without power in Bladen County, 4,000 people without power in Prince George's County, hopefully all of your power is restored at this point. But let me show you the last remaining storm with still a lot of lightening over Southern Charles County and now really into St. Mary's County. I put a lightening tracker on this and for 11 o'clock at night this storm is holding together pretty well with heavy rain right over Mechanicsville moving into Leonardtown. About 45 lightening strikes in the last 10 minutes alone. Here's the setup though. We've got this front that is trying to move through, but it is gonna stall out over the area tomorrow. That front is the dividing line between this disgustingly humid air mass we've been in and, well, not exactly Canadian pleasantry, but it'll be a little drop in the humidity a little more manageable levels outside by Tuesday. But we're in that transition period for Sunday and Monday with still some storm chances. So I pulled up here a different weather model showing you over the next 48 hours alone, look at this. I mean, we've got our in-house RPM model showing we could get another 3 1/2 inches in some isolated spots. So what this is showing me is we have a heavy rainfall threat setting up for tomorrow. Tomorrow's storms could bring some locally heavy rain. That is my biggest concern out of all of our storm threats. Yes, I think we could see an isolated strong severe storm tomorrow, like we saw today, but not quite as many strong storms with some damaging winds. But I think the overall greater threat for tomorrow is gonna be some downpours falling on saturated ground and that could lead to flooding. We're also gonna see lightening. So if you're gonna be boating, at the pool, just hiking outside tomorrow, or enjoying brunch, heads up, there will be some storms. You don't wanna be caught outside with them. Okay, Futurecast hour-by-hour. Now after today's storms I do think we're going to see some fog forming overnight, some of that fog could be locally dense. So we'll start the morning with cloud cover with some patchy fog, temps in the 70s. By lunchtime still a bit of cloud cover, but we're starting to see that cloud cover breaking up a bit, temps in the 80s. We head into 3:00 in the afternoon and here's where we start to see those scattered storms developing and I think our storm timeframe tomorrow is a little bit later than it was today. Storms will start around mid afternoon, they'll really ramp up as we head past dinnertime in the evening. Lots of my computer models are trying to keep storms in the forecast throughout Sunday night and even in to Monday morning, but with a lot of heavy storms that keep bringing rounds of heavy rain over the area, that's why I think tomorrow's gonna be flooding a bigger threat locally, especially street flooding and creek and stream levels rising. So tomorrow we start with that patchy fog, a mostly dry start to the day, but it's later in the day we start to bring those storm chances in. I've got highs that are running in the mid 80s. All right, Nats forecast for tomorrow. They're playing Kansas City Royals, 1:35 first pitch. You know I think we're gonna get pretty lucky at the beginning of things, but by the end of the game we'll track some of those wildly scattered storms so by the finish of the game, yeah, it's possible, there could be a rain delay. But I think a, cross your fingers, 1:35 looks like a better start time tomorrow than having something middle of the afternoon. All right, so tomorrow, here's our showers and thunderstorms. We'll go into Monday and that front is still close enough to us to where it leaves us with some storm chances, but as we get into Tuesday and Wednesday that high pressure completely dries us out, it brings in a slightly lower humidity. So overall our forecast becomes a lot more manageable outside in terms of humidity and storm chances Tuesday and Wednesday into this week. By the way, Tracking the Tropics, this week. 20% chance we could have a system develop. It's actually an upper level trough which is over Western Tennessee, but it's gonna move out to the Gulf and this is the area we're gonna watch for some heavy rainfall set up shop into this week. So if you're taking a vacation out towards PCB, Panama City Beach, Pensacola, even over to New Orleans, that's what I'm tracking this week in the tropics. All right I lowered the high temp tomorrow to 88. I think a bit of cloud cover, fog, in the morning is gonna limit how high we get, but it's humid with some thunderstorms late in the day and into tomorrow night. A few more storms Monday, dry Tuesday, dry Wednesday. We'll bring back some storm chances Thursday and lower humidity returns on Friday, Zo. 
- All right, thank you Melissa. Well, if you have an appetite for burgers the place to be this holiday weekend is Wisconsin. I know you're not gonna like me after this, going to bed, not thinking about food, and then I show you this juiciness. The chef's at Riverfest are offering up some of of the tastiest burgers anywhere, so they say. It's the fourth annual Burger Bash, and get this, for 10 bucks people can sample burgers from competing chefs in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Iowa, and then vote for who should win the People's Choice Award and a $300 reward. Member's of local organizations, and chefs, they made up a panel of judges that decided the best burger.. 
- This is definitely a competition. Our chefs take this seriously, our judges take this seriously. When the community comes in and they give their input the chefs really like to know what people think of their, of their recipes. 
- [Zo] I love seeing the people behind her they look so happy. Proceeds from the event will go to the, Beer By Bike Brigade's fundraiser to pay down school lunch debt for kids.

- [Announcer] And now, WUSA9 Sports brought to you by XFINITY. 
- All right, take a close look at this right here. All the Nationals the uniforms they wore today, there was a powder-blue kind of jersey there, and the pants that the Montreal Expos wore through their inaugural season 50 years ago. It's the first time the Nats wore these Expos, throw-back uniforms, if you will. As for the game. 
- [Announcer] Kurt Suzuki, deep to left, see, you, later. Above the bullpen. What a great combination to a long at-bat, three-nothing, Nats. 
- See, you, later, no, no. Melissa was supposed to join in with me on that one, left me hanging. All right that two-run blast was more than enough. Support from Max Scherzer who picked up his ninth win of the season. The Nats shut out Kansas City six to nothing. And Nationals' third baseman, Anthony Rendon, will not play in the All-Star game. He says he's dealing with some minor ailments and he needs a little time to rest and heal. We wish him well. All right, the Orioles are in Canada this weekend to wrap up the first half of the season. 
- [Announcer] And delivered, boy did he get that one, way back left field and it is, gone. Goodbye home run it stayed. So the Orioles slide to that foul pole. And Nunez cranks one. A couple of RBI's and a two-nothing lead for the Orioles. 
- Yeah, and that two-run blast was part of a five-run, fourth, that helped Baltimore beat the Blue Jays, eight to one. The Birds have now won three in a row, keep going. All right and we are just hearing tonight that the Washington Wizards have acquired forward, Davis Bertans, from San Antonio, in a three-team deal with the Spurs and the Nets. The Wizards sent the draft rights of forward, Aaron White, to Brooklyn and the Spurs acquired, DeMarre Carroll from Brooklyn. All right, well dramatic changes to the landscape of the NBA. The Los Angeles Clippers reportedly made two big moves. They're signing free agent, Kawhi Leonard, to a four-year, 142 million dollar contract. While completing a trade with the Oklahoma City Thunder for Paul George. Leonard becomes the first player ever to switch teams right after winning the finals MVP. Getting paid nicely too. And, you know, maybe they just needed some time to cool off a bit, but they probably didn't wanna be blasted with sprinklers like this. A mixed-doubles match at Wimbledon was interrupted when a sprinkler just went off, blasting those players who were sitting on the bench during the change-over. Yeah, not fun at all, right? Of course they're quick too. All right, and they're off in this case. A blast of a traditional firework kicked off, Pamplona, Spain, Running of the Bulls Festival opening nine days of uninterrupted partying. How 'bout that? A member of the Northern city's official brass band was chosen this year for Saturday's launch of the rocket, known as the Chupinazo, to mark 100 years since the local ensemble's foundation. You can see revelers there, they're dressed in their white attire, flaunting those traditional red scarves, who just spray each other with wine. They'd have a good time too. American novelist, Ernest Hemingway, immortalized the fiesta that each year draws around 100, or one million visitors for eight consecutive mornings starting Sunday. These dare devils they race with the bulls along a 930 yard street course to the city's bullring. Uh, never. All right, now another kind of race here. A Lithuanian man and his wife they've won the world's Wife-Carrying title, okay, leaping over timber, wading through waist-high water to beat dozens of other couples for a second year running. The couple cleared a grueling 278-yard obstacle course in one minute 6.72 seconds. That was just a tenth of a second ahead of the former six-time world champion and his partner. Couples from over a dozen countries, they take part in this annual race in Finland and prizes were issued to the first three couples to cross the finish line, as well as the most entertaining couple, best costume, and the strongest carrier. Can you get over this video, this is wild, wild stuff right here. Well, despite the event's name couples do not have to be married. Relationship-building exercise right here. All right, still ahead, heavy rain tonight. What can we expect Sunday and heading into your work week. Well, Melissa is back with the latest, next.
