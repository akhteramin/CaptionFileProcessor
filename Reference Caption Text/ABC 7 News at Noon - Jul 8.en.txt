- [Announcer] Now, ABC7 News At Noon on your side. 
- And we are wishing you a happy 4th of July as we come on the air at noon. Millions all across the nation are celebrating America. So many events happening in our area, they're happening right now. The National Independence Day Parade is just kicking off. That happened just a short time ago and for now, it looks like the weather is cooperating but we are bracing for some storms and our Steve Rudin, he's got the timing and he is tracking all of this for us. Steve, happy 4th to you. 
- Same to you Lindsey and we are looking at the greatest threat for those stronger storms or heavier downpours later on this afternoon into the early evening hours. Looking downstream on the Potomac from our camera atop The Watergate Hotel, we are dry right now but that is going to change over the next several hours. Do have a Flash Flood Watch for the D.C Metro including Montgomery County, Fairfax, Arlington, Alexandria, the District and Prince George's and also parts of Loudoun County until eight o'clock tonight. Here's StormWatch7's Satellite and Radar. A few showers beginning to bubble up just across North East D.C over toward Brookland moving off toward the North and East. Nothing heavy right now but as mentioned that will change as we head through the next several hours. Here's our FutureCast. This is the high resolution model. We're gonna stop it for you at two o'clock and look at how quickly this model has those storms popping up. They don't move very fast. Could bring heavy rains to the District, Arlington and Alexandria four pm and continue as we move into the all important six o'clock, seven o'clock hour. If there's any good news here, by eight o'clock tonight, showers become more limited and then the fireworks display is set to begin at 21:07 should go on at least according to this model here although the cloud deck may be a little bit on the low side. Worth watching and we're going to keep you updated. Look at these temperatures. 88 degrees already at Reagan National Airport. That is just part of the story with feels like temperatures now in the middle 90s. We have a heat emergency posted for the District that is done by the District government. Cooling centers are open for those who need them. Coming up in a few minutes, an updated look at our FutureCast plus we're looking ahead to the rest of the long holiday weekend. Lindsey? 
- All right Steve and we do want to talk about that just the weather is holding up so far for that National Independence Day Parade and our Nathan Baca is there. So Nathan, happy 4th of July to you. Just how crowded is it right now? 
- Well it's getting more crowded. I'm gonna show you the situation right here. I'm gonna do some crowd surfing over here. So right now, I'm on seventh approaching Constitution Avenue. They are telling everybody to move back from the street. People wanna crowd onto the street. In fact, I'm happening to kind of move around some folks. Hey, how's it going, happy 4th of July everyone. So, this is what's going on right now. Just to give you context, here's the National Archives over here and you see some people here celebrating 4th of July. Where you guys visiting from? Anybody? 
- Atlanta. 
- Washington D.C. 
- Oh good you guys are local, excellent. Well we, just to give you some context again, police are telling people to stay on back. That right there is the Parade and I'm gonna show you some of the floats on down the way. We've been noticing some bands. People have been coming here to hear those bands. In fact, this is what some people that were visiting, not only from Alexandria for the first time but also from Georgia had to say. 
- The reason why we're out here is to celebrate the independence from Great Britain. Also our nation over the last 243 years really and then, to be amongst patriots. 
- I don't see any controversy. Like I see everybody really coming together and I'm just like, it makes me happy cause we're not seeing anything so vulgar, anything ugly, it just makes me happy that everybody's here together to celebrate such a great day. 
- All right now I talked about one of those bands. You see one of those bands right there. That is what she was coming to hear and there are plenty more bands and plenty more floats coming on by. So again, the situation here, we do have a lot more, I'll say, a lot more political signs, a lot more political hats and advertisements that typically you would see on a 4th of July parade but a lot of folks are here, just coming in from all around the country hoping to just get a good party and a good old D.C parade. Reporting live from Constitution and Seventh, Nathan Baca, ABC7 News. 
- All right Nathan, enjoy it down there and that is just one of many parades going on in our area. The streets of Arlington, it was packed there for the annual Barcroft Parade. and this evening President Trump, he is going to do his Salute to America with an independence extravaganza featuring tanks, military flyovers and a speech at The Lincoln Memorial but some say the President is politicizing a national holiday. Mona Kosar Abdi has the very latest. 
- [Mona] It will be the show of a lifetime, President Trump has promised on Twitter ahead of his extravagant 4th of July celebration. A costly production, Trump has also promised will be worth the expense. An array of military hardware on display at The Lincoln Memorial including tanks that have already been ushered in. The Salute to America spectacle will also include multiple military flyovers and an extended fireworks show topped off with a speech from the Commander and Chief himself. 
- We're gonna have planes going overhead. The best fighter jets in the world and other planes too. 
- [Mona] But the event is setting off more than pyrotechnic devices. It's also sparking backlash from critics who accused the President of staging a glorified campaign rally and turning the celebration into a partisan event. The event is free but The White House has given VIP tickets to Republican National Committee and top donors. Congressman and 2020 Democratic Presidential candidate Seth Moulton, calling Trump's celebration quote Unamerican. 
- It reminds me of the Soviet Union. It's unpatriotic because that's, militarism is not what American patriotism is about. 
- As for the price tag, neither the Administration nor the Pentagon has disclosed what the cost will be to taxpayers but ABC News has learned the National Park Service is reportedly diverting 2.5 million dollars from improvement projects. President Trump adding overnight, the fireworks have been donated and the cost will quote be very little compared to what it is worth and the $750000 worth of fireworks were donated by an Ohio company that lobbied the President last month to hold off on new tariffs on China. The President announced he would do so the same day he announced the donation. Mona Kosar Abdi, ABC News, Washington. 
- Security will be tight downtown today and tonight for Independence Day celebrations and for President Trump's Salute to America. Each event has strict guidelines on what you can bring and what you cannot. The priority is safety. No weapons, no alcohol, not even drones or balloons are allowed and for the Salute to America, no backpacks, no large purses, coolers or Tablets. For a complete list, you can head over to our website, WJLA.com and you can find everything that you need to know for today all in one list whether you're heading to events, wanting to avoid the city or watching fireworks in your neighborhood, it is all on our free ABC7 News app. we have a reminder this Independence Day that fireworks are not toys and they need to be used properly. The Consumer Products Safety Commission, they always do these demonstrations on the National Mall. This is what they did last week. They like to do these demonstrations to show just how quickly things can go wrong when fireworks are not handled properly. New data reveals that emergency rooms across the US treated more than nine thousand fireworks related injuries last year. More than half of those injuries involving young children were caused by Sparklers. Happening right now, the 103th Annual Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest is going on in Coney Island, New York and 11 time champ Joey Chestnut looks like he might make history again. He set a world record last year, he ate 74 hot dogs in 10 minutes. We are monitoring that and of course, we will have some video for you later. Coming up next at noon, it's probably the largest display of stars and stripes that you'll see this holiday.

- The Justice Department is hitting reverse on its course over the Census' citizenship question. President Trump tweeted that the Department of Commerce and DoJ are working hard on this holiday to keep that question. As Trevor Ault reports, our judges ordered the Administration to resolve the conflict by tomorrow. 
- [Trevor] A week removed from a Supreme Court decision blocking the Administration from adding a citizenship question to the 2020 Census, President Trump still defiant tweeting that the Department of Commerce and the Department of Justice are working very hard on this even on the 4th of July. That message contradicting the Justice Department's announcement that Census forms were being printed without the question Are you a US citizen?. 
- I think it's very important to find out if somebody's a citizen as opposed to an illegal. 
- [Trevor] While the President is insistent, the fight for the citizenship question is ongoing, his comments have sparked confusion. A Maryland Federal Judge convened a conference call Wednesday after she saw the President's tweet saying reports the question had been dropped were fake. On the call, Department of Justice lawyers couldn't explain the President's rederick. One lawyer saying quote the tweet this morning was the first I had heard of the President's position on this issue. I do not have a deeper understanding of what that means at this juncture other than what the President has tweeted. The Justice Department did admit the President contradicted them but said they have now been instructed to explore whether there's a path forward consistent with the Supreme Court to allow the citizenship question. The Trump administration had previously argued they needed the Census question to better enforce the Voting Rights Act but Chief Justice John Roberts shot down that line of thinking calling it contrived. 
- The Court ruled that the citizenship question was not about whatever cockamamie reason Donal Trump gave for it. 
- While the Department of Justice is following the President's instructions, they are running low on time. They only have until tomorrow to explain to the courts how they plan to comply with the Supreme Court's ruling. Trevor Ault, ABC News, Washington. 
- We have an update following Monday's violent protests in Hong Kong. Hundreds of protestors wreaked havoc inside the city's legislative building and four of them are now talking about why they did it. They tell the associated press that the refusal of city leaders to listen to their demands drove them to desperation and they say that they concluded peaceful demonstrations were pointless after the failure of Hong Kong's pro-democracy umbrella movement in 2014. Pretty sure a lot of you might have been freaking out a little bit after realizing your Instagram, your Facebook, WhatsApp accounts were not working the way there supposed to yesterday. Well those issues have been resolved. Users on the social media platforms say that they were having trouble uploading or sending images. There's no word yet on what may have caused that issue. Team USA now knows who they will be facing in the World Cup final on Sunday. It will be the Netherlands. They were able to knock out Sweden with a goal in the 99th minute to punch their ticket to the final. The good news for team USA, co-captain Megan Rapinoe says that she will be ready to go on Sunday after missing the semi-finals against England. It's the largest flying display of the stars and stripes in the nation. The PNC American Flag balloon was inflated this morning in Ridgefield, New Jersey all in celebration of Independence Day. That hot air balloon is five stories tall. A pilot from Pennsylvania created it after the attacks on 9/11. The balloon is flown in the New York City area every year since then. That's ginormous. 
- Yeah, really big. 
- Yeah 
- All right-
- 
- and you have to have perfect weather for that too. 
- For them, yes. 
- Yeah. 
- For today, not gonna want to fly a hot air balloon. So a lot to talk about moving through the afternoon hours. Crowds are beginning to build. Heat emergency for the District so stay hydrated and the best news of all, not everyone has AC so cooling centers are now open in the District. So, good news there. Do want to show you this time lapse and this is our Skylapse7 for you showing Northwest D.C and you can see, actually the clouds beginning to move on in. These clouds will eventually produce some heavier amounts of rain as we move through the afternoon hours and that's why we have a Flash Flood Watch for parts of the area. Live view right now, there are the clouds. We are going to keep clouds in place. Tidal Basin, looking quiet for right now but we know those crowds are definitely going to build and then our camera atop the Watergate, looking good right now although it is on the hot and humid side. 88 degrees at Reagan National this hour. 88 in Leesberg. 85 degrees in Warrenton. 85 in Fredericksburg. Do want to show you these feels like temperatures. Well into the middle to upper 90s inside and around the Beltway. Already feels like 104 degrees over Annapolis. StormWatch7 Satellite and Radar does show a few showers developing North of Montgomery County with some heavier downpours inside the Capital Beltway. Head off to the Cheltenham area, over toward Laurel and Bowie, that's where you're looking at a few showers right now but the showers and heavier downpours are going to become more prolific moving through the afternoon hours. Here's the latest for you on the Flash Flood Watch for the District, Arlington, Alexandria, also Fairfax and Prince William, parts of Loudoun, Montgomery and Prince George's County. As until eight o'clock tonight, the all important FutureCast, this is our high resolution model, look at the heavy rain forecast at two o'clock this afternoon. Montgomery County and at Prince George's over toward Andrews and as we head through the three o'clock hour, once again the potential for torrential downpours at the District over toward North East and upper North West D.C and then we'll do it all over again for the five o'clock and six o'clock hour before things start to settle down just a little bit but some of these slow moving storms capable of producing upwards of two inches of rain over a relatively short period of time and by eleven o'clock tonight, a little bit of patchy fog but most of the storms are out of here. Here's your 4th of July outlook as we move through this afternoon. Stay weather alert, temperatures will be in the lower 90s. Feels like temperatures even hotter than that with feels like temperatures upper 90s to near 100 degrees. Now waking up tomorrow morning, it's hot and it's soupy once again. Temperatures that will be in the 70s. Highs tomorrow will eventually make it into the upper 80s to around 90 degrees. Unsettled again tomorrow so grab the umbrella as you head outdoors. Always download your StormWatch7 Weather app or at least have it ready to go. It's gonna come in great use later on this afternoon especially if you're going to find that perfect place to watch the fireworks, not only at the National Mall but throughout the area. Here's your seven day outlook Lindsey and we have temperatures at or above 90 degrees tomorrow and Saturday and then a little bit of a cool down but to pinpoint exactly who's going to see the heaviest of the rain, our models do a pretty good job in showing that over the District and Arlington and Alexandria, moving through early to mid afternoon into the early evening hours, fingers crossed 21:07 tonight we'll get all this out of here but my other concern is a low cloud deck. 
- Okay. 
- Two years ago, we had the fireworks. 
- Right. 
- Would of been beautiful but when they shot up, they disappeared and all you saw were flashes. So, 
- Right. 
- Could happen again this year. 
- All right, so hopefully, I'm gonna be an optimist here 
- Yes. 
- And say, fingers crossed, hopefully all will go according 
- I hope so. 
- To our plan. 
- We'll have a new update coming in.

- We are back now with a health alert. As families head to the beach this Independence Day, we have got another reminder of how important sunscreen is. So parents, if you don't remind your kids, odds are they may not be putting it on at all and when they do, are they applying enough? Becky Worley has the eye-opening sunscreen experiment. 
- [Becky] You know how kids feel about sunscreen? They hate it. 
- I don't want sunscreen on. I don't need it. 
- I get annoyed. 
- Sunscreen's icky. 
- It's quite annoying. 
- [Becky] But parents know it's a must. The American Academy of Dermatology says even one blistering childhood sunburn is a contributor to later life skin cancer. So while the CDC says children of all skin tones should wear sunscreen regularly, past research shows nearly four in 10 kids don't. Why? Well I submit this reenactment from my daughter. 
- Put on sunscreen Emmy. No I don't wanna put on sunscreen. 
- It's a battle. That's what I get. Mom, stop. But Holly Thaggard, a former elementary school teacher and founder of her own sunscreen company, Supergoop! says there is an alternative. 
- If you're old enough to brush your teeth and wash your hands, you're old enough to do your own sunscreen. 
- Really? Okay, let's try. We're using a special camera fitted with a UV Sensor. When sunscreen goes on, it shows up as black and highlights any missed spots. We start with seven to nine year olds to see if their application is thorough. The kids put it on then we review what they missed. 
- As each of these children apply, none of them hit the ears and the ears are actually very vulnerable to sun damage. 
- [Becky] Another frequent miss. 
- [Holly] Children forget to apply it right on into the hairline. 
- [Becky] And something all the younger kids struggled with, not using enough sunscreen. 
- Aw oh. 
- When I come over here, what do you see? 
- Uh, I missed a lot of spots. 
- [Becky] Holly says the younger kids are afraid of getting sunscreen in their mouth or eyes. 
- We're missing a few critical spots right around the eye area which is often where sun damage is first detected from an aging and a skin cancer perspective. 
- [Becky] And a study showed kids using just one quarter of the amount of sunscreen needed to get the protection listed on the bottle. Moving up to the older group, the 11 to 12 year olds were much more consistent. Devin used a lot of sunscreen and so did Gus, also an 11 year old who seemed to get the why. 
- I feel like I try to avoid it but I shouldn't cause I know that having a grandpa who had skin cancer, so I shouldn't get it, try to prevent that. That's a lot isn't it? 
- [Becky] But Holly says he's doing it right. 
- Use enough to where you're applying it so that you can see it on your skin and then rub it in until you can't see it. 
- [Becky] All the kids said they learned a lot and the takeaway, start them young but kids 10 and under need a lot of coaching to get adequate protection. 
- I always like the spray stuff. Adults don't like it that much either. All right now in our area, our weather, we are on alert here, not rain just yet but we are expecting some showers at some point this afternoon. Steve's gonna be back timing it all for you after the break.

- All right welcome back. We're talking about the weather and it's the rain that we're really keeping our eye on. 
- Yeah and slow moving clusters of wet weather that could bring some very heavy downpours. That's why we have a Flash Flood Watch for the areas that are shaded in green and more important, the District, Arlington, Alexandria, so many people trying to find that perfect place to find the fireworks this week or this week, this evening. This is what we expect in terms of this evening. We're going to call for temperatures that are going to be on the hot side and then by two o'clock this afternoon, look how the areas of yellows and oranges of red really begin to pop up on the screen. Three o'clock and I'm gonna stop this at four o'clock, five o'clock, a little bit of a lull but keep in mind, this is just a computer simulation. So these may be off, four, five miles. In the big picture, that's not a lot but it could make a huge difference whether it's over the District or whether it's in Fauquier County or whether it's in Northern Montgomery County. So everyone has a very good chance of heavy rain moving through the afternoon into the evening hour. 
- So, is everyone going to be affected or possibly just some people we don't exactly know where just yet. 
- We don't know exactly where. 
- Okay. 
- But pretty much everyone. 
- All right. 
- At this point. 
- Thanks Steve. 
- I wish I had better news. 
- We're gonna keep tracking it for you though and of course we have the app as well so you can watch the radar along with Steve and we'll be back right after this.

- [Narrator] Now, ABC7 News At Noon, on your side. 
- Americans are ready to celebrate the Independence Day holiday in variety of ways. From barbecues to fireworks and meanwhile officials in cities all across the nation are taking precautions to keep their large gatherings safe and secure. Karin Caper is on Coney Island Boardwalk in Brooklyn, New York. That's where they're gearing up for a very big day which is already underway. Karin? 
- On the national level, federal agencies say no specific credible threats against the holiday but law enforcement will remain vigilant whether it's at the major celebrations like here in New York or down in D.C or one of the smaller celebrations taking place across the country today. Independence Day celebrations set across the country and AAA forecasts nearly 49 million Americans making a getaway to celebrate. 
- We see unemployment is low. Americans have additional disposal income. So, they're taking that additional money and putting it towards a trip with friends and family this year. 
- [Karin] In Washington, President Trump will deliver a speech at The Lincoln Memorial in addition to the traditional fireworks over the National Mall and for the massive fireworks display here in New York, prime viewing spots will be under the eye of the NYPD with patrols in the air and on the waterways. Crowd safety measures will include bag checks and thousands of officers on duty. 
- This is what the NYPD does. We have so many large events during the year. We'll be ready, everybody come on down, it's gonna be a great show. 
- The National Retail Federation estimates Americans will spend $6.7 billion on 4th of July barbecues. Here at Coney Island, they'll take things a few steps further. At the corner of Surf and Stillwell Avenues, crowds will gather for the Annual Nathans Hot Dog Eating Contest watching competitors like Gideon OG and Juliet Lee who qualified at Washington's Capital Barbecue Battle. Contestants have 10 minutes to down as many hot dogs and buns as they can and reigning men's champion Joey Chestnut has won the competition here 11 of the last 12 years and last year, he set a record with 74 hot dogs. That might seem like a lot but it is just a small fraction of the 150 million hot dogs Americans are expected to consume today. At Brooklyn's Coney Island, I'm Karin Caifa. 
- And now to our weather. Steve, it's looking pretty calm out there right now but there are storms a brewing. We can only hope that it won't rain on anyone's parade and we're listening to that live music there which is oh so nice and of course we want them to be dry when they're preforming. 
- Yeah absolutely. Unfortunately as we move through the mid afternoon hours into early evening, it's gonna get wet around here. To pinpoint exactly who's going to see the heaviest rain, best chances will be inside and around the Capital Beltway. That's where we already have a Flash Flood Watch that's been posted starting at one o'clock this afternoon and extending until eight o'clock tonight. StormWatch7 Satellite and Radar, what's going on right now, a few showers beginning to erupt North and East of town, nothing that is terribly heavy. That heads to the Montgomery County, Frederick County border over toward Urbana, North of Gaithersburg, even a bit of thunder and lightning right now. Here's the latest for you on our FutureCast and this just updated for us. Notice the showers, thunderstorms begin to pop up as we head through the two o'clock hour becoming more numerous and heavy as we head through the four o'clock hour and then by six pm, could be looking at a heavier cell over Manassas, over into Fairfax and whether or not that moves over the District or just pours itself out is still yet to be determined. Let's talk about temperatures right now. 88 degrees at Reagan National but that's just part of the story. We feel like the middle to upper 90s to close to 100 degrees. Coming up in a few minutes, we'll show you FutureCast one more time plus we're looking ahead through the fireworks tonight and then the upcoming weekend. All that and much more coming up, Lindsey? 
- Steve, thank you. This 4th of July, ABC wants to honor a true American hero. A pilot who flew more than 400 missions in three different wars. It's a story that is very close to Robin Roberts' heart because of her own family legacy. 
- On this July 4th, we are giving the opportunity to reflect on our rich history and those who have served our country, who protected and fought for our freedom, the freedom that we enjoy to this day. No one better exemplifies this sentiment than a true American patriot. Bronze star, World War II veteran, Colonel Charles McGee. 
- Thank you. Thank you so much. 
- Thank you for serving. 
- [Robin] 30 years in the Air Force, 409 missions and 99 years young, Colonel Charles McGee is an American hero. Wherever he goes in his iconic Tuskegee Airmen red blazer, all eyes are on him. 
- Thank you. 
- Thank you. 
- Thank you for your service sir. 
- Appreciate that. 
- [Robin] The Colonel, one of the first black Fighter pilots who battled the enemy abroad and segregation back home. 
- The black American second class citizens who digged dirt, built roads, drive trucks, cook food but do anything technical, impossible. 
- [Robin] But the Tuskegee Airmen made the seemingly impossible, possible completing over 1200 combat missions during World War II. 
- You might say the Air Force really led our country in providing equal access and equal opportunity for all. 
- [Robin] On this day of Independence, Colonel McGee reminds us to set aside our differences and stand united as a country. 
- We are all American now. Why they want to, for me say oh you're African American. What are you, German American? And realize that it's one of the big challenges of today to recognize all for who they are, what they do and how they carry themselves in supporting our country. How's school? 
- Oh good, good. 
- Good? 
- We're doing good. 
- Keep it good. You know why? You're the future of the country. And I love that and that's what I try to pass on young folks as they develop their talents and find them. Hopefully they put their finger on something they enjoy doing. You realize that you have to reach out and share those experiences. When folks ask how are things? I just have to say life is a blessing. 
- The Tuskegee Airmen also known as the Red Tails and I am an honorary member, that's why I have my red blazer. I'm also honored that I am the daughter of a Tuskegee Airman, Colonel Lawrence E. Roberts and like Colonel McGee, he shared his secret to success with his children and Colonel McGee's are the four Ps he calls them. Perceive, prepare, perform and persevere. Sounds a lot like my daddy. Many thanks to the friends of the National World War II Monument and the daughters of the American Revolution for letting us use their beautiful spaces. We really did appreciate it. Happy 4th of July.

- We are back now with a 15 year old phenom who continues to dominate opponents twice her age Ian Pannell is in Wimbledon and has, or is at Wimbledon and has more on Coco Gauff's latest win. 
- [Ian] Overnight, this fairytale got another incredible chapter. With poise and power beyond her years, 15 year old Cori Coco Gauff sailed into the third round of Wimbledon after dominating an opponent twice her age. 
- [Commentator] The newest star shines a little brighter. 
- [Ian] Coco's latest victory coming just two days after the American teen sensation rocked the tennis world with a first round victory over her idol Venus Williams. 
- [Commentator] It's a dream debut for the 15 year old. 
- [Ian] That win making her an instant star bringing the praise and approval of some of the greats. 
- Hey there she is. How's everything? 
- Good. 
- Congratulations, great job. 
- Thank you. 
- When are you playing? 
- Last on court two. 
- Oh okay, play well. 
- Thank you. 
- Cheers, bye. 
- You got that on camera? I can lie and say it wasn't hard but it was definitely hard to reset all this buzz going on and I was just telling myself if you want more moments like that, you got to continue to work hard and continue to stay focused. 
- [Ian] But reset she did, on Wednesday defeating Slovakia's Magdalena Rybarikova. The packed house and her proud parents on their feet in a rare ovation. 
- [Commentator] And she did it with such style. 
- Everything has come together. I am so proud of my daughter. Watching her, the maturity that she has developed in this last week and a half, two weeks. 
- Obviously she wants to win the tournament but regardless of the outcome, for me we've already had a success cause we've come here and we've seen growth in her. 
- [Ian] Coco now the youngest woman to advance to Wimbledon's third round since 1991 and she's not intimidated. 
- I think I can beat anyone who's across the court and if I don't think I can win the match then I won't even step on the court. 
- She's on the top of her game and you are on the top of yours today. You are looking at the forecast with a fine tooth comb. 
- Absolutely and a lot to talk about, hour by hour as we move through the afternoon. This right here is Skylapse7 and look at the boat traffic on the Potomac. Up and down, everyone's trying to get from point A to point B. This is what it looks like, a live view for you right now showing our skies are hazy and cloudy, at least it's dry inside the Capital Beltway. Over toward Friendship Heights and Chevy Chase, clouds continue to build and our next stop, the Tidal Basin, traffic look at that, doesn't look that bad but a lot of roadways are closed so be sure to check with ABC7, WJLA.com for the latest traffic maps. 88 degrees right now at Reagan National, 87 Manassas, feels like temperatures already at 100 in Leesburg, feels like 96 degrees at Reagan National Airport. A heat emergency for the District. That means cooling centers are now open throughout the District. So if you don't have AC or you need a place to take a break, that's where you need to go. Heat index values throughout the afternoon well into the 90s. Some of these heavier downpours will cool us down but it's still gonna stay really sticky out there moving through this afternoon into this evening. StormWatch7 Satellite and Radar, look at the showers, the heavier rain already beginning to blossom North of Gaithersburg, up toward Urbana, Barnesville, Damascus, all looking at wet weather right now. The same for Lanham, nothing that is severe but slow moving storms capable of producing very heavy rain over a short period of time and also the potential for localized flash flooding. Flash Flood Watch goes into effect at one o'clock this afternoon until eight o'clock tonight. All the areas that are shaded in green. Here's our FutureCast. I'm gonna stop this for you hour by hour moving through this afternoon and evening. Notice the wet weather, develops two o'clock, three o'clock, North and East of D.C. The Eastern edge of the Capital Beltway. Moving into the four o'clock hour, a little bit of a lull at least for the District but then by five pm, we could be looking at heavier rains just off toward the South at West of us. The big question mark, where will these storms set up exactly? Will it be over the District? Will it be over Fairfax? It's anyone's guess at this point. What I can recommend, if you're going out to the National Mall, take extreme caution, make sure that you have a secure place to go should you find some of these heavier downpours overhead. If there's any good news with this forecast, moving into the nine o'clock hour, heaviest of the rain begins to diminish and the chances for the heavier rain will begin to ease. By 11 o'clock tonight, a lot of folks going home, things should begin to improve just a little bit although we may see a little bit of patchy fog. For this afternoon and into the evening for the fireworks, temperatures will be in the 80s. Waking up early tomorrow morning, temperatures are in the 70s once again, very warm, very humid. Highs tomorrow will make it into the mid to upper 80s to close to 90 degrees and we are looking at yet another round of wet weather through the afternoon hours. Seven day outlook from StormWatch7, 91 on Saturday, 87 degrees on Sunday, we drop back down to the 80s come early next week. Lindsey? 
- All right Steve, thank you and Seven is on your side with a Summer holiday warning. According to the CDC, drowning is the leading cause of unintentional deaths in children ages one to four. So before you head to the pool or the beach to celebrate the 4th, Gio Benitez is taking a look at how to keep your family safe. 
- [Gio] It looks like any other Summer pool party. Young people splashing in the water, parents enjoying the barbecue but somewhere in this pool, five different swimmers are about to simulate that they're drowning and we're wondering if these moms and dads can spot them. Drowning can happen in just seconds and it's often difficult to spot. It's happening to someone in this public pool right now. Can you spot it? There she is. Fortunately a lifeguard spots her and makes the rescue. But it's in residential pools where lifeguards usually aren't present that the majority of drownings take place. Safety experts say part of the reason, distracted parents. Talking on their phones, grilling, socializing and supervising other children with no water watcher, a person with eyes on the water at all times. So we've invited this group of parents to a pool party, assigning them tasks like running that grill and of course, tending to their own young kids. We've also added swimmers splashing in the pool but those swimmers are actually trained lifeguards and swim instructors from Swim Jim's swim school skilled in mimicking a drowning. The parents know they're here to learn about water safety with some sort of demonstration beginning in about an hour but since drowning often happens when you least expect it, we begin right now. With cameras rolling, I watch from a garage just next to the pool observing some parents checking the water but mostly they're focused on their assignments and the party and after 30 minutes, there we go, she went under, our swim instructor Kelly begins simulating a drowning, struggling to keep her head above water, arms clawing for the surface and just like the real thing, she barely makes a sound. Meanwhile, our guests seem not to notice. More than a minute goes by. She's still struggling and nobody's looking. We're now looking at more than two and a half minutes and still nobody notices a thing. After more than four minutes, she simulates a worst case scenario and stops moving. Remember, she's a trained professional and is just acting. Josh from the American Red Cross has been watching with us. Four and a half minutes, still no parent noticed anything. 
- Right. 
- Does that surprise you? 
- It does not. 
- [Gio] Kelly goes back to swimming and we cue another swimmer and another and another, all mimicking a drowning but nobody steps in. 
- We don't realize how quickly these kind of things can go from just a fun pool party to an incident where someone needs help. 
- So now, the kids are gonna get out of the water. They're gonna go get some snacks and they're gonna leave someone behind and that person is gonna start drowning. After 30 seconds of purposeful struggling, this dad spots her. 
- You all right? Huh? 
- Within 36 seconds, he noticed. 
- It's great that he noticed. We hope that they would notice faster. 
- He says in some cases, swimmers can submerge in just seconds making them even more difficult to spot. It's time to reveal our experiment. Someone was drowning. There were four drownings that nobody spotted. What's that make you think? 
- My kids are on the deck so I turned my back. Doesn't mean there weren't other kids in the pool though. 
- I got thrown off by the age. So I think we took for granted that they all knew how to swim. 
- For the man who spotted our victim, it's too close to reality. You were visibly shaking. 
- Yeah. 
- [Gio] Why were you so nervous? 
- It's, it did happen to my child. 
- [Gio] His daughter Valentina survived but he says when she was just three, she began drowning in a hot tub, he was on the phone. 
- I got a phone call and I got distracted and she was in trouble. So, that brought memories. 
- Water safety experts say one of the solutions is a water watcher, somebody standing next to the pool free from distractions, constantly scanning the water for any signs of distress, rotating every 15 minutes to avoid losing focus. We showed the parents what they missed. This is that moment when she's motionless in the water and this seems to be very emotional for you. 
- They're all our kids. What else do you say?

Areas that are shaded in green. Here's our FutureCast, two o'clock. Notice East of D.C, heaviest the downpours are on the way and as we move through the three o'clock hour, the four o'clock hour, this is our high resolution model. It does keep the heaviest of the rain at least according to this model outside of the Beltway however this could shift a few miles and around here, three, four, five, six miles makes a big difference. As we move into the seven o'clock hour, eight o'clock hour, things begin to improve for the fireworks. So your 4th of July afternoon and evening forecast looks like this. It is hot, it is humid. Temperatures well into the upper 80s to near 90 to start. Heavier downpours could bring upwards of two inches of rain. Localized flooding, even some thunderstorms with gusty winds. We're gonna keep you updated all afternoon right here on ABC7 and on WJLA.com. Bill will be in here, I'll join him later on this afternoon.
