- [Max] All right we're back. 
- [Nev] So yesterday we did some research. 
- We don't know what to make of this. 
- We're a little befuddled. Okay so here's where we started. So the first thing we found, we searched his number, bingo. 
- Look what we got. Number for five years, comes back to a Matt 
- This never happens. He's in Florida where he says he lives. So this was kind of a-
- 
- Good. 
- Surprise. And he also has a Twitter. Then there's some pictures back from 2012 that look like they're of him. This would have been the Matt that you sort of started talking to. 
- Then we looked up his URL. 
- We actually got a bunch of hits. The first one was this. A PlentyOfFish account that's up, I don't know how or when it was last active. For a guy who lives in Kissimmee. 
- 21 years old. 
- This is. 
- Six foot two. There's also this photo. It could be him. 
- I'm not sure if I should even make a comment. I'm not sure what to say. 
- What's, are you upset? I can't tell. 
- Do you mind if I take a second? 
- Sure. Yeah. Take as much time as you need. 
- [Nev] You all right? 
- Mmmhmm. 
- [Nev] What was uh? 
- I just got really warm and just overwhelmed. 
- [Nev] But like, good excited warm overwhelmed? 
- Um yeah. 
- [Nev] Well that's good. 
- Like this turned out to go better than I thought. So I'm completely speechless. I hope that it's him. 
- [Nev] Take as much time as you need. I mean. 
- That's okay. 
- [Nev] But yeah I mean it is exciting. It's cool. I mean the guy seems legit. 
- [Max] Good? 
- Mmhmm. 
- [Max] Regroup? 
- Yeah. She's got like a little overwhelmed because I think she figured that this was gonna end up being like a huge embarrassing disaster. Anyway. Looks like this guy is in Florida. He's the right age. Just to be sure we went through his Facebook posts and we saw that there was one girl who seemed to be like a good friend of his. So we reached out this girl Crystal. Crystal does know him. She confirmed everything that we assumed we knew about him. 
- She also said she thought he had a girlfriend right now. 
- As far as you know is he currently dating someone? 
- She wasn't sure. But she did say she thought he had a girlfriend right now. But we talked to Nick, his brother. Nick said that Matt is not in a relationship right now. 
- [Nev] I mean at this point we don't know what to believe. [Music] Who am I [Music] [Music] Who am I to me [Music] [Music] If all I see [Music] [Music] All see is you [Music] [Music] What am I [Music] [Music] What am I to do [Music]

- [Nev] Here's what we know. Matt is a good-looking, young guy from Florida who did live in California. The only concern we have now is why haven't you video-chatted. Why hasn't he sent you Snapchats of his face? If he is real what's he not telling you? What're we missing? 
- Just kinda wanna get off the floor (laughs). 
- [Max] Sure. 
- So here was are. We've got some questions that we're trying to answer. If you definitely wanna meet him then we have to decide that right now and figure out what that means and how we wanna make that happen. 
- I definitely wanna meet him but I'm terrified of heights and I'm terrified of planes so unless there's a different way to get there I can't. 
- [Max] We can work with that. 
- Why don't we see if he'll come here. I'm gonna call this guy. Okay. Ooh I gotta show her this photo I forgot. I forgot after we hung up with Crystal she texted us a picture of them together. Like a recent photo. So that, there he is. 
- [Max] What do you think of him? 
- Um well he's not ugly. 
- I think he's stunning to be honest. Just very handsome. 
- (laughs) Oh my god! 
- All right I'm gonna go call him. 
- How do you feel? 
- Nervous. 
- [Matt] Hello? 
- Yo is this Matt? 
- [Matt] Yes. 
- Hey how you doing? My name is Nev from that show Catfish. I actually spoke to your brother earlier. We're out here in Sacramento with Kim and we were wondering if you wanted to meet up with her. 
- [Matt] But why would she call the show? 
- She didn't actually write in to us her friend Joe wrote in and was concerned that maybe you weren't who you said you were. I think after five years it'd be great for both of you just to meet up and see what happens and kind of move forward. 
- [Matt] But it's not that easy. I just got a lot going on. My brother got out of surgery. I just started a new job. You know there's a lot, there's a lot of factors in life. 
- Yeah I just don't get it. Why isn't he sending pictures? Why is he chickening out from meeting you? Or lying about it? Something is up. 
- We could come to you but I don't know if you know this but Kim is sort of very afraid of flying. If it was possible would you come to her? 
- [Matt] I'll meet her. I do wanna see her. 
- Okay great this is good we're making progress. 
- [Matt] All right. 
- I'll see you soon. 
- [Matt] Okay. 
- All right, later. 
- [Matt] Bye. 
- All right so I talked to him. He does wanna meet you. I think we're gonna try and get him on a plane tonight so that you can meet up wit him first thing in the morning. 
- Wow. Are you gonna be okay tonight? 
- Yeah. 
- [Max] You're gonna meet him tomorrow. 
- [Nev] Hopefully we'll get you some answers. 
- Okay. 
- All right. He's flying all the way out here so just make sure you're ready to talk to him. 
- Thank you. 
- She is a nervous nelly. 
- I mean now I'm beginning to wonder if it was him avoiding meeting her 
- [Max] Right! or if she's just avoiding him and he probably picked up on that like. 
- [Max] Yeah she could've been the one that bailed every time.

- She's having quinoa and vegetables and beans. 
- [Nev] Wow I love it. We got up here, we met this girl Kim. She's been talkin to this guy Matt. We did the investigation and from everything we found it looks like he's him, that he's actually the guy in the pictures. 
- Great. 
- Something's not adding up. Maybe they're both sort of awkward and that's why they haven't figured it out and met up yet but it feels like we're still not getting the full story. 
- I hope it's a happy ending, I always hope for happy endings. 
- It would be nice to get one. 
- [Laura] Yeah. 
- Oh no. I think Cleo's done with her dinner.

- [Kim] All right bye guys. 
- [Both] Bye. 
- [Max] Who's that? 
- [Joe] Hey. 
- [Both] Joe! 
- How're you guys doing? 
- [Nev] We were hoping we'd get a chance to meet you. 
- [Joe] Kim actually called me last night and she was like kind of panicked. And she just like let me know that there were some things that she didn't tell you guys. 
- Do you know what it is? 
- Um yeah but it's like it needs to come from her cause it's not really my place to say. 
- Hey. 
- Hey. 
- [Kim] Hey. 
- [Nev] Who's this? 
- It's uh, our kid. 
- What? 
- Yeah. 
- [Max] Wait you guys have a kid? 
- Yeah. I wasn't sure if Kim wanted to bring her into the situation. She didn't want to make Norma known at any point. 
- [Max] Norma? 
- Yes this is Norma. 
- Okay. 
- [Max] Pieces of the puzzle are coming together. 
- [Nev] Hi! 
- After we moved in she got pregnant and then we just didn't work out. She hasn't actually-
- 
- He doesn't know that, Matt doesn't know you have a kid. 
- [Max] He doesn't know that. 
- Okay. 
- She did not let Matt know because he told her some things that like made her not want to bring her up. 
- [Nev] What? Like he doesn't like kids or? Doesn't wanna have kids? 
- Yes exactly that. 
- [Nev] Right. 
- Doesn't like kids, doesn't wanna have kids. 
- Mmmhmm. 
- What do you then think of this guy who you know could be a potential step father to your kid who doesn't like kids and, 
- [Nev] Lives in Florida. 
- [Max] And doesn't send her pictures. 
- You don't want her movin' to Florida. 
- Oh no. No no no no. 
- [Max] Right. But you know that that's what they've been talking about right? 
- Just add that to the list. This guy won't send you a picture, doesn't like kids, doesn't wanna have kids. This is turning into more and more of a bad idea Kim. 
- Daddy's gotta get you baby. I'm just here to pick her up. Y'all doing your thing. 
- I love you. 
- Give kisses. Give knuckles to, give 'em knuckles. 
- Hey, boo boo boo boo boo boo boo. 
- [Joe] It was great to meet you guys. 
- Yeah you too man. 
- Later Joe. 
- [Max] Oh wow okay. You're in trouble Kim. 
- [Nev] So Matt doesn't obviously know you had a kid. 
- When I was pregnant and talking to him I didn't get big until the very end and at one point I was actually supposed to come out to see him but I went into labor so I bailed. 
- Of course you bailed. 
- [Nev] Cause he was here when you were pregnant. 
- Yeah. 
- You know he doesn't care for kids. Do you think he could be a good father to Norma? 
- I hope so. I mean I've never met him so I don't know exactly how he is in person. 
- You really love this guy? You really think Matt is like a good fit for you? 
- Um I believe so. 
- All right so it's all out there. Matt's plane should have landed. Let's meet at Discovery Park. We've got a date! 
- I'm ready. 
- Are you? 
- I think so. 
- Okay Mr. Matt. 
- Guys how am I supposed to tell him about my child? 
- You just gotta do it. 
- Let's let him tell you first. 
- He's gotta few things to answer. We wanna know why he never sent a picture of himself. 
- [Kim] Mhm. Why he didn't make more of an effort to see you when he was in Sacramento. Right? 
- [Kim] Mhm. We wanna know how he really feels about you. 
- I mean if he's the person he says he is why not just tell me who you are? 
- [Max] Maybe he's not the guy in the pictures. 
- The whole thing to me just doesn't make any sense. All right Discovery Park here it is. Right here. What I expected. 
- [Max] All right fingers crossed. 
- Oh. 
- [Max] Uh oh yeah. I see someone. That could be him. 
- I'm ready.

- Yep. 
- Oh my goodness. 
- Oh (beep) 
- Max. 
- [Nev] What's up? Nev. Thanks for coming out. 
- So I do have a few questions. Just out of curiosity, you got a girlfriend? 
- No. 
- Why no pictures of you? Why won't you send me any? 
- I don't like being in front of the camera. 
- Okay but for five years you've been talkin to this girl, how do you not send her a little video? Just so she knows it's you or something. 
- You are who said you were, you weren't lying about any of that. So then what's the holdup? 
- I'm a secretive person for the most part. 
- I think the bigger question is do you care about her? 
- I do. 
- In what way? 
- Like it would suck if something happened to her. Like that's how I would feel. 
- That's one way to answer the question. 
- I mean I care about you. I mean I was there when your mom died. You were there when my grandfather died. I mean that's kind of hard to like brush off. 
- Do you guys mind if I take a second? 
- No come back here. 
- Yeah stay here. 
- [Kim] Can't. 
- Yeah you can do it. 
- The hysterics are nice. 
- [Max] Kim! 
- [Matt] This is. 
- [Max] Kim. 
- [Matt] Interesting. 
- It's him. 
- I know it's. 
- [Max] He's good looking. 
- I know. 
- He's skinny though. 
- I know. I can fatten him up. 
- [Max] That was quick. Is it weird seeing her? 
- It's awkward under these circumstances. 
- Sure. 
- But like have you been? 
- Just let them be weird with each other. Here it is, we made it happen, now you guys let's see what happens. 
- [Matt] Anything else you gotta ask? 
- So do you still not like children? 
- I mean it's iffy. Why? 
- Well I haven't really been exactly honest. I actually have an almost two-year-old daughter. 
- Huh? 
- [Kim] I have a child. 
- And you decided now to tell me? 
- Yes. I mean like I get that I was lying but can you really blame me? Like you told me to begin with you don't like children. Which leads me to my next question. Would you like to be her godfather? 
- Hold up. I've never even met her. I'm just now finding out about her. A child. Okay now my anxiety's through the roof. 
- She didn't meet you when you came to visit because? 
- I bailed because I went into labor. 
- Kim why don't you tell Matt how you feel about him. 
- Do I have to do it with all of you guys? 
- [Matt] There's a bench over there if you wanna sit. 
- Yeah you guys go sit go talk. 
- Okay. The past five years I can't say I didn't fall in love with you because I did. I guess I just have huge feelings for you. Can you like not just stare at me? 
- I'm at a complete loss for words. 
- Okay so like this is really like pointless. I'm walkin back that way. 
- Okay. 
- Here come over here. 
- I just wanna see the water. 
- Can we just talk? 
- Sure yeah. 
- Let's take. 
- Give us a minute. 
- Get out here. 
- Give us a minute. 
- Can I go for a run? 
- Yeah do it. 
- Thanks. 
- Don't fall in the river. 
- Okay so do you want kind of a romantic thing with Kim or not? 
- That I can't really decide right now because I'm still trying to process everything that's going on. I would have to sleep on the whole thing and maybe get a clear head out of it. 
- That's fine. We can meet up tomorrow but I think by the time you leave she deserves some sort of clear answer from you on where you stand. Kim. I think maybe that's enough for today. All right so we'll take Kim back to the car.
