- As far as the squad itself, after the game, they posted a video of most of the team dancing to the 2007 banger Rock Yo Hips. If you don't know it, that sucks for you. But the fact that this song is what brings this team together is amazing. Oh, and the name of the group who made it, probably describes both country's histories of money making quite well, Crime Mob. God bless them, and God bless America. NFL Live's next. We're back on July 11th. I'm Clinton Yates, kiddos. Got it! 
- NFL Live packed with special guest stars today. Jaguar's quarterback Jalen Ramsey joins the show live to talk about how the Jags bounced back this year. We'll also talk to Browns tight end David Njoku about all the excitement in Cleveland and what's ahead for the Browns. And since tomorrow is Independence Day, we will show you some of the best independent plays in NFL history. You'll wanna stick around, if only to find out what we mean by that. Oh yes, if you just can't get your holiday weekend started without hearing 90 more minutes of NFL off-season content, you have come to the right place. Dan Graziano here with Damien Woody and Mike Tannenbaum. Lots to get to on the eve of your long holiday weekend, but we will start with the situation regarding Ezekiel Elliott. The Cowboys superstar running back met Tuesday with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell to discuss a recent incident involving Elliott and a security guard in Las Vegas. Elliott was briefly detained but not arrested in the incident. Given his history with the league's personal conduct policy, the commissioner called him in for a discussion. Following that discussion, Elliott posted the following statement on Twitter. Earlier today I met with the commissioner to share with him what occurred in Las Vegas and what I have learned from that incident. I've worked hard to make better decisions and to live up to the high standards that are expected of me. I have failed to do that here, and I made a poor decision. I apologized to Kyle Johnson, that's the security guard in question, at the time and I meant it. I need to work harder to ensure I do not put myself in compromised situations in the future. I am rededicating myself to use all of the resources that the league has made available. But in the end, it is up to me and I am determined not to be in this position again. Why is this a big deal? Well, partially because of the warning commissioner Roger Goodell issued to Elliott when he suspended him in 2017. In his suspension letter at that time Goodell wrote to Elliott, You must have no further adverse involvement with law enforcement, and must not commit any additional violations of league policies. You should understand that another violation of this nature may result in your suspension or potential banishment from the NFL. So look, we are not here to make equations or comparisons between things that Ezekiel Elliott did in the past and what this incident was, but here he is sort of making the wrong kinds of headlines again. And being called into the commissioner's office, no small thing for a player in his situation. So Mike, if you're in the front office of this team, and you have a player in this situation. He's got a contract situation coming up over the next couple years. What kind of conversation do you need to have with him at this time? 
- Yeah you need to have a direct, honest, and very difficult conversation. You have to let him know that this behavior is unacceptable and this is more than one instance. And as you said, Dan, maybe it's not as significant as the one that happened in the past. But from the Cowboys organization what I would tell him is, Look, we're gonna hit pause on your contract negotiations. There's four other players right now that the Cowboys have. Dak Prescott their starting quarterback, Amari Cooper, who they traded for from the Oakland Raiders. And two good defensive players in Jalen Smith and Byron Jones. All four of those players are going into the last year of their respective contracts. They have played well and acted flawlessly off the field. I would have that conversation with Ezekiel Elliott to say, While we appreciate what you've done on the field, right now you're under contract for this year. We have the option for 2020, and we can franchise you the year after. So basically, for the next three years, we can control your rights. And because of the way you've acted, we're hitting pause and it may not be what you wanna hear. But that's the conversation you need to have with the player. 
- Damien, from the standpoint of a teammate of a guy like this in this situation, what conversation are you having with him? 
- Well listen, I think it's just important that you're available. Because for a veteran, at the end of the day, if the guy who basically stirs the drink isn't available, you're affecting my money. You're affecting everybody in the organization. I mean, think about it. Jason Garrett is, this is like his contract year. This is his year, do or die year, and you're putting yourself, you're Ezekiel Elliott, you're putting yourself in a compromising situation where you could be potentially suspended and not available to the team. There's so much riding on the Dallas Cowboys this year that it's all hands on deck. And if I'm a veteran in the locker room I'm like, Dude, okay, let's chill out, calm down. You can't keep putting yourself out there, because you're hurting everybody, not just yourself. 
- And Damien, to your point about how Ezekiel Elliott stirs the drink, look at Dak Prescott, he has some passer rating of 122 from when it's play action. And the reason that's so effective is, the opposing defense is worrying about Ezekiel Elliott. So, that is not by coincidence that he has such a high passer rating from when they're in play action, because everything's gonna be keyed on Ezekiel Elliott. So, if he's not available, it does disrupt. Now look, Amari Cooper was a very valuable acquisition, but without Ezekiel Elliott, that offense is a lot easier to defend. 
- So, no question obviously about the importance of Ezekiel Elliott to the Cowboys' offense. They struggled without him in 2017 when he was suspended. We await word from the commissioner's office on whether he will face discipline for this latest incident and if that word comes in the next hour and a half, we will of course bring it to you. In the meantime though, we're gonna move on to the sillier portion of our show. Tomorrow is the 243rd anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. We didn't have access to Thomas Jefferson, we have Damien Woody and we have Mike Tannenbaum, but even though they might not have been the first choice on declarations, Jefferson couldn't make it. We've decided to ask them of some declarations of their own. So, basically what this is going to be is something you feel strongly about, something you feel like declaring about the upcoming NFL season. It doesn't have to be about life, liberty, or the pursuit of happiness. It has to be about football. Damien, start with you. What's your first declaration of the day? 
- So, my declaration is that Kirk Cousins will be the best quarterback in the NFC North this year. 
- Whoa, whoa. 
- Yes. I'm going out there on Kirk Cousins and the Minnesota Vikings. I love what the Vikings did in the draft, adding a couple pieces up front on the offensive line. They have arguably the best wide receiver tandem in Thielen, and in Diggs on the outside. They drafted Irv Smith, you know, tight end from Alabama to go along with Kyle Rudolph. And obviously Dalvin Cook in the backfield. So everything right now is ready-made. Mike T. is trying to jump in on this, but I'm not gonna let him jump in. I am adamant right now that Kirk Cousins is gonna get it done in the NFC North this year. Don't make me look like a fool, Kirk Cousins. 
- Yeah, we're gonna have an NFL constitutional crisis because, let me tell ya. I got the words Aaron Rodgers. 
- Listen, I understand Aaron Rodgers is in the NFC North and I got much love and respect for Aaron Rodgers, but I also look at this. What did the Green Bay Packers, how much addition did the Green Bay Packers add to Aaron Rodgers, you know that offense, to help Aaron Rodgers this upcoming year? Not much. I didn't see much of anything this year. 
- Guys to develop. 
- Like I said, with Kirk Cousins this is the year. He's getting paid a boatload of money. The Minnesota Vikings drafted guys up front to help on their offensive line, and I think this is the year that Kirk Cousins makes a statement in the National Football League. 
- So if he does, what does that mean for the Vikings? How far can they take it? 
- They can go to the Super Bowl. 
- Oh, boy. Vikings. 
- If you have-
- 
- This is how we do declarations. 
- If you haven't figured it out by now, I'm pretty bullish on the Minnesota Vikings. 
- But Damien, we know the sign of great players when they make everybody else around them better. Isn't that one of Aaron Rodgers's greatest strengths, is that he could elevate the play of his teammates? And I agree, Minnesota's had a good offseason, Dalvin Cook's coming back. But at the end of the day, isn't Aaron Rodgers the better player than Kirk Cousins? 
- Yeah, Cousins had the highest completion percentage of any NFC North quarterback last year and the most touchdown passes. But as he would tell you, he was only 1-6-1 against teams with winning records. Obviously you gotta do better than that. Mike, what do you got to compete with that Damien Woody declaration? 
- Well, I will stay with the same position. And I'm going to declare that Kyler Murray will not play in 16 games And my concern for Kyler Murray is his play style is very similar to someone like Marcus Mariota. Marcus Mariota, throughout his career has never played in 16 games. And while Kyler Murray is a dynamic athlete, because of his build, I think at some point it's gonna be hard for him to answer the bell at some Sunday this season. And I could see him missing at least one game. So my declaration is, Kyler Murray, based on his size, based on the way he plays, he will not play in 16 games. 
- Very interesting, because a lot of excitement about Kyler Murray and that Kliff Kingsbury offense there in Arizona the first year. But he is a scrambler. He scrambled 41 times last year, ninth most of any FBS quarterback. That's certainly going to be part of his game. They say that that helps when they are questions on the offensive line. Do you buy it, or do they need to be better up front? 
- No, they need to be better up front. I'm a big believer, listen. Football isn't very complicated, you gotta block, you gotta tackle, catch and all those type of things. And what we saw from the Arizona Cardinals last year, they couldn't block their way out of a wet paper bag. So, this is gonna be a situation that bears watching as far as Kyler Murray and protecting him moving forward. 
- [Mike] By the way, we heard the same spiel a couple years ago when I was the general manager of the Jets, we were trying to sign Damien Woody the offensive lineman, he reminded us then about how important the offensive line is. 
- [Damien] Yeah, and listen, the tape don't lie. The tape doesn't lie. 
- It was a softball, I knew I was setting him up. I like to take care of Damien on the summer show. 
- That's right, that's right. 
- To get through together. We got more to do, though. Coming up on NFL Live, as we mentioned earlier, Independence Day is tomorrow. We're not on the air tomorrow, we're gonna celebrate it a day early with the NFL's most independent plays. Looking at the guys who can do it all by themselves. Speaking of doing it all, Cam Newton may be rehabbing his throwing arm but that doesn't mean he can't catch. Which quarterback has the best hands? Damien Woody's gonna take a shot at ranking those. Plus, Jalen Ramsey, one of the top trash-talkers in the game, but has he changed his ways? We'll bring him in live and he will tell us. 
- I go out there with a little swag. Sometimes, I just go out there, and just, I just let the receiver know every play. Hey, this gonna be a long game for you. You're trash compared to me. 
- I got a very, very small loan from my father. 
- You gotta start somewhere.

- It's something that my mom always warns me about, you only get one set of teeth. 
- From ear to ear, he's always smiling. 
- I'm happy to be a part of that. 
- He's always kidding around and keeping it light. 
- If I'm feeling good, I know that it's gonna be contagious enough around others. 
- [Dan] Why is Cam Newton smiling, because he's awesome. He can run, he can throw, and apparently he can catch. Recently, in an Under Armour camp showing off his hands running a go route, catching a one-hander behind his back. Odell Beckham has got nothing on Cam. So, got us to thinking as we do in the offseason, and I know Damien always says we don't give quarterbacks enough attention around here. One of the most best quarterback catches of all-time. This Mohammed Sanu pass had trouble written all over it until Andy Dalton made a leaping catch to bail out his receiver. Took it rest of the way to the endzone, finishing with a sweet dive to the pylon. Look at Andy laying out. 
- [Damien] He could've gotten smoked right there. 
- [Dan] What about Andrew Luck in college. He had a couple of targets last season, maybe it's because Frank Reich took a look at this one-handed catch he made when he was at Stanford. The catch is impressive enough, but he also gets that foot in-bounds. 
- [Damien] Wow. 
- [Dan] Not a catch in the NFL though, right? 
- [Damien] Not a catch in the NFL. 
- [Dan] Gotta work on that toe tap. 
- [Damien] Gotta drag it. 
- Great athlete though. 
- Yeah, no kidding. 
- That's pretty clear there. But I don't think they're gonna have him doing too much of that. Of course, the Philly special. How do we forget the Philly special? First catch by a quarterback in Super Bowl history. Nick Foles's acting job before the snap might've been even more impressive than the catch itself. But what a moment, all-time moment in NFL, and certainly Eagles history. So obviously, quarterbacks are all-around athletes too. In some cases. 
- Yeah. 
- I know, I know, it hurts you. 
- It hurts. 
- To give this much praise to quarterbacks, but here we are. It's July 3rd, man, we're gonna do it. We're gonna grind out this content. Damien, I want your list of the most versatile quarterbacks currently playing in the NFL. The guys who can do remarkable things. 
- Yeah, so number five, we're gonna start with this big guy right here in Josh Allen. The thing I love about, Josh, everyone talks about the huge cannon arm, right? He can throw it all over the place. But look it here, I didn't know he was an Olympic hurdler as well. I mean, just jumping over the Minnesota Viking defender right there. I mean, that was a huge play in that Buffalo Bills win up in Minnesota last year. So, this dude is a tremendous athlete. Look for him to have a big year this year. 
- He led the Bills rushing last year. 
- That's right, that's right. 
- You guys were looking at quarterbacks a little bit, you know, with the Dolphins two years ago. What'd you think him coming out? 
- Yeah, everything that Damien said. He's big, strong, can make all the throws. He's gonna have to learn how to kind of corral that in, so he can play a full season. He's gonna be taking a lot of hits. 
- You mean play quarterback? 
- Yeah. 
- Number four, what you got? 
- Number four right here, we're gonna go right here with Mitchell Trubisky. I mean, listen, I almost wanna call Mitchell, Mitchell Vick. You look at this run right here, he started at the 15, goes all the way back to the 30. This play here against the New England Patriots. Just watch this guy run. He's a really good athlete. He can really run with the football in his hand. Dangerous both throwing and running the football. So again, guy just takes off in the pocket. He's pulling away from people here. Listen, when a defense gotta defend both of those aspects of a quarterback, makes it awfully tough. 
- I think he's done a great job of designing an offense to play to his strength. Brought a lot of those Andy Reid concepts from Kansas City. That's a hard offense to defend. 
- Number three? 
- So, number three, get you a quarterback that can do both. We got Big Ben here. Listen, we all know Big Ben is a future Hall of Famer, but how about this? How about with the pooch punt right here. Playing situational football, at that Mike T. Situational football, downed the ball inside the one yard line, huge play. Again, Big Ben showing off his prowess with another pooch punt. Setting it up right here, setting it up for the special teams, so. When you got a quarterback that can not only go out there and throw for 300 yards, but can set your field position up, guy deserves to get paid. 
- You know, he must enjoy that. They call that pooch punt, he must be loving it. 
- Oh, absolutely, absolutely. 
- Must be hard to keep a poker face. Number two? 
- So, number two, we got Killa Cam, Cam Newton right here. 
- Number two, huh? 
- Listen, Cam Newton is obviously a physical freak of nature, you're going to see why right here. That little trick play, boom! Dropped the hammer down on the defensive lineman. How many quarterbacks are willing to throw their shoulder in on a defensive lineman right here. Just knocking him down to the ground. Cam's not a small, Cam's a big boy at quarterback. So, it really doesn't surprise me that he knocked that defensive lineman on his butt, but again, an offensive lineman can appreciate a quarterback that's willing to throw his body in there for the play. 
- He is physically imposing. When you see him come out for warm-ups. You think wow, this guy could be a lot. He is a physically imposing player that happens to be a quarterback. 
- That's right, that's right. 
- Couldn't even do a quarterback segment without you talking about blocking, unbelievable. 
- And then obviously. 
- This guy. 
- This right here, Hall of Famer right here, Patrick Mahomes. And listen, we always talk about, as a father, you always talk about having your kids involved in more than one sport. Well here's why, you see a guy in Patrick Mahomes. Great football player, also great baseball player. You see him throwing from all different arm angles. Being able to make plays, throwing with his left hand. I mean, he did this time after after time again during the season, and that's what made him special. No-look passes, and to me that's the product of playing multiple sports. They kind of intertwine with each other. And the big reason why he was the NFL MVP last year. 
- Mike, when you're evaluating quarterbacks, and you look at all-around play. How much does it factor in, how athletic they are, or whether they can do other stuff like this? 
- It's really important. Look, it starts with accuracy. But being able to buy a second chance. You know, we touched on it earlier in the show about Kyler Murray playing behind that Arizona offensive line. The fact that he'll be able to avoid, move up in the pocket, sometimes it's not about just gaining yards, but it's about avoiding the big hit, extending the play, keeping your eyes down the field. It's really important, and that's a skill that transfers from college to pros. And, as you mentioned, Damien, what Patrick Mahomes did at Texas Tech in that offense we're seeing with the Kansas City Chiefs. 
- Do you guys know, trivia time here. Do you guys know which active NFL quarterback has the most career catches? They don't know. 
- No. 
- Drew Brees, he has eight. 
- Wow. 
- How about that? 
- Eight? 
- Really? 
- Yeah, we'll run them back, we'll run them back. Maybe another show, later in the summer, we'll do Drew Brees highlight catches. And maybe have you rank them. 
- For the content, we need the content. When we come back, Jalen Ramsey's not been shy about sharing his opinion on things like quarterback rankings. Now, he's got a Super Bowl MVP leading his offense. Does Jalen think Nick Foles can lead this team to a championship? He will join us live.

- [Announcer] Intercepted by Jalen Ramsey. 
- [Jalen] You're trash compared to me. 
- Very pleased to welcome in to NFL Live, Jaguars cornerback, Jalen Ramsey, who joins us today from London, England. Jalen, I gotta start here, I was dismayed when you recently told our Adam Scheffter that you were going to get out of the business of evaluating quarterbacks. You were so good at it, why have you decided to stop? 
- Really, I went through most of them last year, I think. To be honest, I didn't think I needed to do it again. My opinions were my opinions, and they didn't really change too much. So yeah, I just didn't feel the need to do it again. I wanted to pump up Nick a little bit at mini-camp, and I was excited to see Nick out there. So I wanted to pump Nick up a little bit. But yeah, just got away from it for a little bit. 
- I'm gonna ask you about Nick in a little bit, but I'm wondering as you went around the league last year, did you hear a lot about that interview that you gave where you talked about all the quarterbacks? People give you a hard time, or tell you you were right? 
- Yeah, I mean, it was opinion-based. Exactly how it went, we were just talking a little bit, and we started off naming, like, who I thought were the top five quarterbacks. And then we started going down the whole list, and I was kind of saying, kind of still keeping that mindframe, like yeah he's not top five, or he's overrated, his this, that, he's sorry, he's good. Whatever, he gets the job done. Whatever I was saying about each every quarterback. Yeah, just giving some opinions. Some people, of course, they're gonna agree, and some people are not gonna agree. Everybody's entitled to their own opinion. 
- Absolutely, we enjoy it. But you mentioned, your new quarterback, Nick Foles, joining the Jaguars as a free agent this year. What's the one thing about him that jumps out at your so far that you may not have known before he was your teammate? 
- I mean, just how well he practices, I guess. Because, I've of course never practiced with him. And those three days in mini-camp, I got to see how he comes out there and he works hard. And he pushes the guys and he leads the offense. It was truly impressive. I had already known and heard about how good of a teammate he was, and how good of a person he was in general. Just seeing him in the locker room, being in his presence, and, you know, communicating with him in our few interactions, it was super nice. 
- So, starting quarterback is obviously a major change on any NFL team. What's the biggest difference in the Jaguars this year versus last year having made that change? 
- Yeah, I do feel like it's an upgrade. Of course, I was a fan of Blake. Blake was a really good teammate to everybody. But, you know, having Nick, a former Super Bowl champion, and Super Bowl MVP, we have supreme confidence in him. And we think that he's going to do a good job of leading our offense. Of course, on the defensive side of the ball, we are overflowing with confidence over there, and talent, and guys who we think can get the job done over there on that side. So now, we've got somebody outside. To roll with Leonard, and DD, and all the other guys over there. So we're super excited. 
- So yeah, the defense obviously completely dominant. Two seasons ago, you guys came agonizingly close to the Super Bowl. And then last year, obviously, a disappointment for the team all the way around. So what gives you the confidence that this can be closer to 2017 than 2018? 
- We're just gonna embrace the journey, to be honest. People say, like, trust the process and stuff like that. I really don't even believe in that, because we can make how ever many plans we want to in our head, and whatever we feel like the process is. But it's truly gonna be a journey. It's gonna be ups and down, and highs and lows, and we have to roll with all of them. We have to roll with the highs, we have to roll with the lows, and we have to push through it to make sure that we are in position to win the division, win the conference and go to the Super Bowl and compete for Super Bowls. 
- You've quickly established yourself as one of the better players in your position in the league. But the NFL being what it is, you're still a ways away from free agency. The Jaguars picked up your contract option for 2020. 
- Yeah. 
- Any extension talks yet, or is that still on the backburner? 
- It's on the back burner right now, but that's completely fine with how first-round contracts are structured right now in this current CBA, teams have a lot of leverage. They can pick up the fifth year option, so unlike other guys, who outplay their rookie contract and can re-up right now and get basically what they're worth. First rounders don't have that luxury. We have the fifth year option, then after that, they can either franchise tag, and you know, do any and every which thing that they want to do. They have a little bit of leverage, but I'm gonna let my agent handle a lot of that. I'm gonna just focus on what I can focus on, and play ball and help the team win while I'm here in Jacksonville. Hopefully, I'm here for a long time, and when it's time to open up contract negotiations, we'll see how things go. Of course, we wanted to get it done this year, but it won't get done this year. And hey, it is what it is. I'm moving forward from that. We've talked with the Jaguars and everybody who's in charge of that, so they know what's up. They know how it's gonna roll. 
- So you're coming to us from London today. And obviously, the big story over here in the States is the US women's soccer team beating England in the World Cup yesterday. And what's caught the attention of a lot of people is Alex Morgan, right, the tea sipping celebration of the goal. This has become a big, huge thing over here and probably there as well. What are your thoughts on it as a known trash-talker? 
- I loved it, of course. Just like you said, I've been known to trash-talk, myself, and do a little bit of it here and there. So I loved it. I thought it was very fitting, of course, because of who they played, obviously. And sealing it up, why not have some fun? I mean, we're professional athletes of course, but we're also entertainers in a sense. We want to keep everything interesting. So now, she gave people everything to talk about, a lot to talk about. I think it's cool, I think it's good. 
- Jalen Ramsey, thank you so much for joining us on NFL Live, and sharing your insights. Best of luck to you this coming season. 
- Appreciate it, thank you for having me. 
- All right, so back to our declarations if you weren't here earlier. Tomorrow's the Fourth of July and the anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. So we're making some NFL declarations today, here on NFL Live. Earlier, Damien made a declaration about Kirk Cousins. He was very vociferous. Mike, you got one on the Jaguars? 
- I absolutely do. I declare that Nick Foles will lead the Jacksonville Jaguars to the Super Bowl representing the AFC. And I know that you know this because you're a student of the game, but last year, in division games, the Jacksonville Jaguars averaged less than 10 points a game. You take what is already a championship-level defense, led by Jalen Ramsey, and this year's first round pick, Josh Allen with a quarterback who won a Super Bowl two years ago, and but for a drop in the last year's NFC playoffs, may have brought the Eagles to two consecutive Super Bowls, so that's my declaration. 
- This is interesting because Jalen Ramsey has, in fact, stayed on the line and heard your declaration, Mike Tannebaum. So Jalen, I'm curious what your thoughts are on Mike's declaration about the Jaguars. 
- Yeah. Yeah, I love that declaration right there. Speak it into existence for us, I love it. I'm super excited to have Nick on the team, and we're gonna put all that confidence behind him, and we're gonna let him lead the offense. And like you said, this defense we have, we think some big things could be in store for the 2019 season. 
- So Jalen, when everybody else is getting on that Jaguar bandwagon come the regular season, just remember we had this conversation on July 3rd, and that was my declaration. So I'm with you guys, the bandwagon starts today. Let's not let anybody else on. 
- Thanks, Jalen. 
- I got you. 
- [Dan] We appreciate you sticking around. 
- Appreciate y'all. 
- Love it. That declaration, we should have Jalen in, and he could do his declaration. 
- So you just go all in on my head about Kirk Cousins, but you all in on Jacksonville. Listen, Nick Foles was great with Doug Peterson. It seems like they had a chemistry. So you think they can recreate that in Jacksonville with this whole different cast of characters? 
- No doubt about it, and as you know, it starts with the offensive line. They have a very good offensive line. They added Jawaan Taylor at right tackle, who's gonna start. Doug Marrone was an offensive lineman, played, coached it, and now he's their head coach. And it allows them to travel, play well on the road. And with that defense, they're loaded up front. They have a lot of depth at pass rusher, when you look at last year's first round pick, Tavon Bryant, (stammering). 
- Ngakoue? 
- Ngakoue, yes, at defensive end. And Calais Campbell, and again Josh Allen this year. I think they have depth up front. They have two cover corners in AJ Bouye, and Jalen Ramsey, you saw. I think they're really built well. And now you have below-average quarterback play in Blake Bortles, and we're being generous with that. And Nick Foles is a good quarterback, so that's my declaration. 
- I'll tell you one big difference, and that might be the reason they sign him. Foles only threw 23 interceptions in 40 games in Philadelphia, Bortles had 58 interceptions in 60 games with the Jaguars. So they should be better there. We're gonna have more declarations later in the show. We're also gonna talk some soccer. Alex Morgan shook up the Twitterverse with her tea sipping goal celebration that Jalen Ramsey enjoyed. Which celebrations from NFL history compare to this surprisingly controversial one? Stay tuned to NFL Live, we'll talk about it.

- With the first pick, the New Orleans Pelicans select Zion Williamson. The New York Knicks select RJ Barrett. 
- I love the biggest stage, I love the challenge. 
- My dreams came true, I'm just ready to work. 
- [Dan] NBA Summer League action, Friday. We've got a triple-header starting at 7:30 Eastern on ESPN, and you won't want to miss that special matchup at 9:30 Eastern Time featuring former Duke teammates, Zion Williamson and RJ Barrett facing off for the first time as pros. Speaking of the NBA, Lakers fan Damien Woody insists that we talk about the Kawhi Leonard free agency situation. Still waiting for word from Kawhi on where he'll end up. But if it is the Lakers, Damien's excited to see that picture right there. 
- That's right, that's right. 
- Would form an imposing big three with LeBron James and Anthony Davis. So, I feel like I've said this about 20 times today. That got us thinking. 
- Got us thinking. 
- About NFL big threes, and we're looking at some pretty good ones right here. Mike Tannenbaum, why don't you rank them for us. Count them down starting five to one. 
- All right, number five, I'm gonna go with the LA Rams, staying in LA, with come on over. 
- There you go. 
- There we go. 
- Jared Goff, Brendan Cooks, and Todd Gurley. The reason why they're only five is while I like Cooks, I don't see him as an elite receiver. He's straight-line, he's fast, but not great at changing direction, so that's why they're five for me. 
- Okay. 
- Yeah. Got them to the Super Bowl. 
- Number four, the Atlanta Falcons. You look at Matt Ryan, Super Bowl quarterback, Julio Jones, arguably the best receiver in the NFL. And then, obviously, Freeman coming off the injury, but he's a good running back. So, I think that's a really solid three guys right there. 
- Both of those running backs coming off of injury. Their seasons could really rest on those two guys to some extent, right? 
- [Damien] Absolutely, and you know, the Falcons, they drafted a couple of linemen up front, so it should be good news for Matt Ryan and Devonta Freeman. 
- Always the linemen, huh? 
- Yeah, that's right. 
- We should have done big three offensive linemen. 
- Yeah, exactly. 
- Cowboy and whatever else. 
- Number three, the Dallas Cowboys. 
- Hey. 
- A lot of people don't realize this, but Dak Prescott, 32-16 as a starting NFL quarterback. Ezekiel Elliott, arguably as good a running back as there is in the league. And Amari Cooper, all they did last year was go 7-2 after the trade. And they were number one over the last nine games on third down. 
- [Dan] Number two, what have you got? 
- Okay, the New Orleans Saints, led by future Hall of Famer, Drew Brees at quarterback. 
- [Dan] Heard of him. 
- Michael Thomas, who is. 
- He's not bad. 
- Who is not bad, right maybe a tick below Julio Jones, and not far behind him, Alvin Kumara. And what I love about Kumara is not only is he a great running back, but he's great out of the backfield as a receiver. And he puts so much pressure on other teams' defense. 
- [Dan] Who could be better than that? I'm a little surprised that's not number one. 
- Yeah let's see, Mike. 
- Who you got at number one? 
- One of your former teams. 
- Oh, okay. 
- The New England Patriots. As someone that's been in the AFC East for 20 years, trying to compete with these guys. Tom Brady, best quarterback of all-time. Julian Edelman, I have so much respect and admiration for him, college quarterback, he has rolled himself into a great player. And look, Sony Michel is the player that Zeke Elliott or Alvin Kumara is, but he was a first round pick, he got better as the year went on. If he can overcome a knee injury, he's gonna turn into being a good NFL running back. But, Tom Brady, it starts with him. 
- You know, Mike, I'm so disappointed in you right now. 
- You know why, you left off my Minnesota Vikings right here. I don't know why you don't believe in Kirk Cousins. Obviously, this might be the best duo in the league in Adam Thielen, and Stefon Diggs. What is up with the hate against the Minnesota Vikings? You need to explain yourself to all the purple people-eaters out there. 
- I watched the tape, that's why. 
- Whoa! 
- All right, all right. 
- That is a good group. I'm not saying it's not likewise with Pittsburgh, and obviously Kansas City. These are all good, but you're talking about a Hall of Fame quarterback in Tom Brady, Hall of Fame quarterback in Drew Brees. You look at Dallas, look, Matt Ryan, certainly has a Hall of Fame credentials, possibly. And I think that five is a really high-level. Nothing to be ashamed of over here, but not in the top five. 
- Do you think that if Dalvin Cook is a healthy running back this year, he could be good enough to put them in this kind of category? 
- Boy, that's a really good question. I think Dalvin Cook is a game-changer. Kirk Cousins is at best with a good running game, good offensive line, play action. And Dalvin Cook could hopefully not only help the running game, but their passing game. 
- Those are our big threes. Still nothing on Kawhi, sorry, we'll let you know if we hear anything, but in the meantime, we're gonna talk to Browns tight end, David Njoku, about all the good stuff coming up this year in Cleveland. 
- What's up DK? I know you're asking yourself, am I worth the hype?

- Breaking news into NFL Live. Cowboys running back, Ezekiel Elliott has been informed he will not be suspended for his role in that recent altercation in Las Vegas with the security guard that we discussed at the top of the show. Elliott met with Commissioner Roger Goodell yesterday, and issued a statement last night about his involvement there, apologizing. And we are now being informed that he will not face another suspension. So obviously a relief for Ezekiel Elliott, and for the Cowboys there. 
- Yeah, absolutely, listen as a veteran in the locker room, this is exactly the outcome that you wanted. You want all your guys, all hands on deck to be available. This is an important year for everyone within the Dallas Cowboys organization from the head coach on down. And obviously, maybe the most important player for their team is going to be available at the start of the season. 
- [Dan] You surprised, Mike? 
- I was mildly surprised, because again, the personal conduct policy's standard is lower than criminal conduct. So, the commissioner could have suspended the player, especially because he's a repeat offender. And the fact that he brought him to New York City shows that it was significant enough for a face to face meeting. And look, at the end of the day, hopefully, Ezekiel Elliott has learned, and all these sort of bumps in the road he's had from off the field are in his past, because he is a great player, and by all accounts, he's a good teammate as well. So hopefully, he's learned from this and he's moved on. 
- [Dan] We talked earlier in the show about the kind of conversation you have with a player in this situation if you're the front office. Does the fact that he isn't being suspended change any part of that message or make it even more difficult to deliver? 
- No, you have to have a stern, direct, and a very hard conversation that your behavior is not acceptable. And even though it didn't rise to level of suspension, it's still not conduct becoming of a Dallas Cowboy. And again, if I was in the front office, making the decision I would hit pause on the contract extension. And I would put my efforts and energy into the good players and the players that have handled themselves the right way off the field, starting with the quarterback, Dak Prescott, and their receiver Amari Cooper. So, hopefully, it's a lesson learned for Ezekiel Elliott, it doesn't happen again. But if I'm the Dallas Cowboys, I have to have that conversation with him and tell him what we're thinking, and why we're thinking it. 
- Damien? 
- Again, as a player in the locker room, you just, this is what you wanted to hear. That he's gonna be available, and we can go out here and win some football games. 
- But I mean, is there anything to the idea, like he's not being suspended, so you still have to sort of make sure that something is learned from this, right, as a player? 
- Well, I mean that's something for the Dallas Cowboys, maybe internally as an organization they want to do, but for a veteran, don't mess with my money. That's my biggest thing is when you're not there, you affect my play, so let's stay on the straight and narrow so we can go out here and win some football games. 
- Not that this necessarily ever happened to you, but do you think being called into the commissioner's office even if it doesn't result in punishment is enough to get the message across? 
- Yeah, it should be like a Scared Straight, you know. Like, you gotta fly all the way to New York to go talk to big bad Roger Goodell. You would think like, okay, all right, let me make sure I'm on the straight and narrow here. So hopefully, Zeke Elliott has learned from this, and the Dallas Cowboys as an organization can move forward now. 
- I think that's the part that there's a lot of people in the NFL community that are surprised about it, because that's what happened the last time two years ago. Got suspended, had to go to the league office, and you would think, especially with the contract on the horizon, that he would really try to be impeccable off the field. But again, hopefully he's learned from it, he can move on, and put this behind him. 
- Lot of expectations for the Cowboys this year. Obviously, this clears the decks in terms of one major concern. They have some contract situations to work through as they head into camp, but you see this as a team that's primed for a real serious run this time? 
- I think the Dallas Cowboys can represent the NFC in the Super Bowl. I think this team, the way that Dak Prescott played after the trade of Amari Cooper from Oakland, the numbers speak for themselves. Across the board, completion percentage, yards per attempt, third down. All those numbers were significantly better with Amari Cooper. Doing a trade during the season, so imagine now in the offseason, obviously you've got a new offensive coordinator in Kellen Moore. We don't know how that's going to all work out, but you think that he's gonna accentuate all the different aspects of Dak's game. This offense, this team in general to me, is one of the better teams in the National Football League. 
- [Dan] Only three teams in the league have won more games than the Cowboys have over the last three years. That's the Chiefs, the Patriots, and the Steelers. That's pretty good company. 
- Yeah, and again, I don't think Dak Prescott gets enough credit, he's 32-16 as a starter. The ultimate measure of a quarterback is win-loss record. And you go back to last year, he had a pass rating of 122 on play action plays. So, it shows you the importance of Ezekiel Elliott's availability, as you mentioned, Damien. So, depending on the health of Carson Wentz, I think Dallas has a really reasonable chance of winning this division. Over the last couple of years, Philadelphia has done such a good job of having depth behind Wentz with Nick Foles. Foles isn't there anymore, Nate Sudfeld is going to be their presumptive backup quarterback. So, Wentz has to overcome that issue. Can he stay healthy for 16 games? And you look at the way Dallas has built this team on both sides of the ball that I think they'll be right there with Philly going down the stretch here. 
- So the NFL has released a statement on this issue regarding Ezekiel Elliott, announcing that he won't be suspended and it reads like this. Immediately following reports of an incident in Las Vegas in May involving Ezekiel Elliott of the Dallas Cowboys, the NFL conducted a comprehensive investigation that included interviews with multiple witnesses, including security personnel and others with direct involvement, as well as a review of documentary and other information. On Tuesday, as part of the review, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell met with Mr. Elliott to reinforce the standards of conduct expected of him, and the consequences for failing to meet those standards. Mr. Elliott acknowledged that he demonstrated poor judgment and committed to make better choices in the future. He volunteered to take advantage of the resources available to him to help him continue to grow personally. Commissioner Goodell determined there was no violation of the personal conduct policy, and no further action is warranted. So the statement confirming what we were told, any quick reactions there? 
- He got lucky. 
- He got lucky. I mean, he could have easily, he could've easily been suspended again. You know, Mike, you had touched upon it prior, but usually in these situations, this is your second time going to New York to talk to the commissioner, you've already been suspended before and you get off with no punishment. He's very fortunate to be in this situation. 
- Something else that they touched on the letter there is that the league and the union both deserve a lot of credit for is the resources that are available to players, to coaches, to staff in terms of if you feel like you need help. And there are a lot of resources behind the scenes, and hopefully if he needs that, that he takes advantage of it and I know they mentioned that in the letter, and that's an important aspect of the collective bargaining agreement. And that's an example of the partnership between the league and the union where they are trying to help players. 
- So once again, the news on Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott, no punishment, no suspension as a result of his most recent incident. When we return on NFL Live, Alex Morgan woke up social media after casually sipping her tea Tuesday. We'll show you some NFL celebrations that Alex reminded us of.

The league has announced that he will not face a punishment for his role in a recent incident in Las Vegas involving a security guard. The commissioner found he did not violate the personal conduct policy, so no suspension for Elliott. Much more on that throughout the day here on ESPN. Big news yesterday in the other kind of football was the US Women's soccer team beating England in the semifinals of the World Cup. Since that team can't seem to do anything without people finding a reason to criticize it. Part of the story has become Alex Morgan's tea-sipping celebration following what turned out to be the game-winning goal. The criticism seems to center on the idea that the celebration was directed at the opponent, which was England. But however you feel about it, it got us thinking about situations in the NFL where people celebrate, and kind of tailor their celebrations a little bit to the opponent. Week four, the year is 2000, 49ers and Cowboys. Terrell Owens celebrates a touchdown by posing on the Dallas star. Was that aimed at the Cowboys, I couldn't tell. 
- [Damien] I love it, man, I love it.

Did his research before the game, I like that. Week 10, 2012, Panthers-Broncos, Von Miller sacks Cam Newton and does Newton's signature Superman celebration. Von, a little takeoff after that. He practiced that. 
- [Damien] That's right, you go into these games, you have them dialed up ready to go. 
- [Mike] Oh, yeah got a little strut there. 
- [Damien] That's right, that's right. 
- How about TO again? Week 8, 2004, Eagles-Ravens, Terrell Owens catches a touchdown pass, then celebrates with Ray Lewis's signature pregame dance. 
- [Mike] Oh he got it, oh that's good. 
- [Damien] I love TO, man. 
- [Dan] Impersonated it before, but that's as good as it gets. 
- [Damien] If you don't wanna see him do it, then you better stop him, I always say. 
- You know he practiced that. 
- Of course. Listen, that stuff, while you front office guys are up in your office or whatever, these guys are sitting in the locker room, they're thinking of all types of things to do on gameday, so I love it, man. 
- [Dan] Did you know that's what they were doing down there while you were in your office? 
- They were studying film? 
- Come on, man, don't be a lame. Look, we're trying to have fun out here. This is a sport, we're trying to have fun. 
- Look, the NFL has allowed some celebrations recently, but they still don't like the direct taunting of opponents. Where's the line? 
- (sighs) Listen, for me it's competition. It's competition for me. I know everyone's gonna talk about sportsmanship. Obviously, I'm a proponent of sportsmanship, but I've always been under the impression that if you don't want people to celebrate, if you don't want people to talk trash, stop them. Stop them, plain and simple. 
- Oh man. 
- And for me, you know when they celebrate as a team, it's great, and the last couple of years, there have been some very creative celebrations. Last year, going back to the Steelers they're bench pressing so to me when it's the team, I'm all for it. 
- Spoken like a true general manager. 
- Up in his office while you guys are all practicing your celebrations in the locker room. Coming up on NFL Live, we're gonna have much more on the Ezekiel Elliott situation. Cowboys running back not suspended by the league after his recent meeting with Commissioner Roger Goodell. We'll come back and talk about it some more, next on NFL Live.

- Recapping our breaking news today on NFL Live. Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott will not face punishment for his role in a recent incident with a security guard in Las Vegas. Elliott met with Commissioner Roger Goodell for a couple of hours Tuesday of this week and was informed he would not be suspended. The NFL released a statement explaining it basically says that they found he did not violate the personal conduct policy, but they hope that he continues to stay out of these situations in the future, Damien what are your thoughts? 
- Well I mean, my biggest thing is does Zeke grow from here? This is the second time going to New York. First time was, I believe it was a six-game suspension. This time, obviously, he got off with no suspension, but you would think that at this point now, it's time for you to grow and mature, and not put yourself in compromising situations, because again, as a veteran, I'm depending on you. Guys in the locker room need all hands on deck, so I just want to see more growth and maturity out of Zeke Elliott. 
- I totally agree, and you take that a step further with the contract situation. If he's behaving like this without that big deal that Todd Gurley deal with $45 million guarantee. You know from an organization standpoint, what is he gonna be like once he has that money? So, not only do I have pause for concern to doing a deal, but if and when we get to that point, now I really gonna make sure that the structure is appropriate where we'll guarantee money, certainly if he gets hurt playing football, but beyond that, we're gonna want to have the ability to move on from the player if there's a third bump in the road in terms of something happening off the field, so he's put himself in that position. And again, he's had some teammates that have played very well, like the starting quarterback Dak Prescott and have handled their business off the field. So, he's done this to himself, so not only would I consider pausing and not doing a long-term deal if and when we got to that point. The structure of the contract would be, I want the player to take the risk, because as an organization, if something else happens I want to be able to cut the player and not have to pay him any more money. 
- That's a key point, if something else happens. He was warned the last time when he was suspended in 2017. And he seems to, as Damien said earlier, maybe he got lucky this time, because they certainly could have suspended him again under the personal conduct policy, given that warning. But this is a transcendent player who has led the league in rushing two of his three years. Led the league in rushing yards per game the year he was suspended. To get to the point where you release him, that has to be a pretty extreme situation, doesn't it? 
- Well listen, we all know how the league works. The more talented you are as a player, the more opportunities you're gonna get. And you said it perfectly, he's a transcendent talent. One of the best players that we have in our league. But again, if you're not available, what good are you to the team? So again, you would like to see Zeke Elliott mature and get past these incidences that we've seen from him. The three years plus or whatever he's been in the National Football League, so he can help his team get to where they wanna go which is to the Super Bowl. 
- That's right, the old saying in pro football, production equals tolerance. And because he's produced such a high level, there's been a high level of tolerance. But at some point, that's gonna equal out, and hopefully he can learn from this, grow, and put all this behind him and help the Cowboys try to win a Super Bowl. 
- Ezekiel Elliott represents the big NFL news of the day. On ESPN though, we don't limit ourselves to NFL. Our next Canadian Football League matchup on ESPN Plus is tomorrow night, it's a week four matchup between the 3-0 Hamilton Tiger-Cats, and the Montreal Alouettes. Looking for their first win of the season. That'll be at 7:30 Eastern. 
- Everybody's gonna say that we could be and should be Super Bowl contenders. 
- Who wouldn't aspire to be the Patriots? Who wouldn't want to be 11-5, 12-4 team? 
- I want to get there, so we can print that. I want to get to be what the Patriots are. 
- [Damien] The Cleveland Browns are going from the hunter to the hunted now. 
- [Announcer] Oh, what a catch by Njoku, touchdown. 
- I said I woke up feeling dangerous, son. 
- I'm almost giddy. I feel like a little kid, the excitement that I have. 
- [Mike] They have no excuse for not being a contender in the AFC to go to the Super Bowl. They have no excuse. 
- Cleveland Browns tight end, David Njoku joins us now. Getting ready for a highly-anticipated season in Cleveland. David, we've seen some of what you guys can do, certainly individually, but what we haven't seen is Freddie Kitchens as a head coach. So tell us, what's Freddie like now that he's the head coach? 
- Freddie's a great head coach, I believe, you know. He's a player's coach if that makes any sense. You know, he knows what it takes for us to do what we have to do, and we know as well. We put everything together, and hopefully good things will happen, you know, so we'll see. 
- Bringing some stability to that situation this year, and obviously last year there wasn't. What was it like going through that last year with all the turmoil and the firings and all that stuff that happened midseason with the coaching staff changes, how tough was that? 
- Yes, you know it was a bunch of turmoil, you know. Obviously, having your head coach fired, and your OC also fired. It brought a lot of questions and the curiosity. But, I feel like as a team and the players, we took it upon ourselves to come together and focus on how we have to finish this year, or this past year, strong. And I believe we did just that, you know. I believe this upcoming year is gonna be real special, so. 
- A lot of times players say that stuff, the front office stuff, coaching stuff doesn't have an effect in the locker room, but were there hard feelings? It seemed like when you guys ran into Cincinnati, Baker Mayfield, your quarterback had some things to say about the situation. Was that a widespread feeling? 
- There's no hard feelings at the end of the day. Everyone must understand that this is a business, and you have to treat it as such. So, there is no hard feelings, you know. Whatever happened happened, it is what it is. And now we're focused on what we have to do to reach our goal this year. 
- Obviously, you guys did not lack for talent on the offensive side of the ball to begin with, but Odell Beckham established as really one of the top receiving options in the entire league. What have you seen from him in terms of what he's shown you on the field, and what kind of teammate he is? 
- Yeah, so Odell is an elite athlete. We were actually all together yesterday. Jarvis, Hollywood Higgins, me, Baker, and a bunch of other guys, Seth DeValve, Demetrius Harris, Pharaoh Brown, together working on timing and everything. So when it comes to us as a unit, we're very dangerous is the word to say. 
- Yeah, how about personal goals for you? Obviously, you know, you're a young player who's still growing in this league. What do you look at and say, here's what I want to accomplish this year and going forward? 
- As long as I feel that I gave it my all, I work to my highest ability, then I'm content with this year. I don't really have any numbers. I was messing around saying 20 touchdowns, but honestly speaking, I just want to have a great year. We want to win as many games as possible, and we want to, obviously, go to the Super Bowl and win it. So that's the big term goal. 
- When you're looking to improve your game, is there something you're specifically working on this offseason that you're trying to get better at? 
- Oh yeah, of course, I mean honestly speaking, I'm working on all aspects. I don't believe I've mastered anything regarding the tight end position just yet, so it's really just everything I want to work on to better myself as an overall tight end and player. 
- I wanted to ask you a personal question, if that's all right. You have eight siblings, is that correct? You're one of nine brothers and sisters? 
- Correct. 
- Your older brother, Innocent, studying to be a neurologist. What kinds of conversations-
- 
- Neurosurgeon. 
- Oh, neurosurgeon, excuse me. Even more impressive. What kind of conversations do you guys have about football and the sort of dangers of your chosen profession? 
- Well obviously, he understand as well as I do that football is a dangerous sport. I have two younger brothers, Evidence Njoku, he plays at Miami right now, University of Miami. And my youngest one, Charles Njoku, he just arrived at UCLA to start his summer program as a receiver. They both play receivers. So, we all understand that football is obviously a dangerous sport, but at the same time, it is our passion. And we work extremely hard to be the best we can be. So my oldest brother, Innocent, he understands that. He loves our passion for it, but obviously, he's the one saying be careful, make sure you're safe and everything so yeah that's pretty much it. 
- I guess it can be handy to have somebody like that in the family. 
- Yeah, I always tell him that once the three of us are done playing football, he has to take care of us in all shapes and forms, so yeah it's all love at the end of the day. 
- Well hopefully, he doesn't have much to do in that regard. 
- David, thanks so much for joining us and best of luck. 
- My pleasure, thank you very much. 
- So if you're Baker Mayfield, the Browns quarterback, you have Njoku, you have Odell Beckham Jr., you have Jarvis Landry at receiver, along with Nick Chubb and Kareem Hunt in the backfield when Hunt's suspension is over. Those five combined for 41 touchdowns last year, and they also had 641 touches. So I guess the big question, a good problem to have, is there enough to go around in that Cleveland Browns offense? 
- A lot of pieces. You know, there's a great collection of talent, but are they a team? And that's what's gonna fall on Freddie Kitchens, because the Cleveland Browns are in a position they haven't been in in a long time where they are the hunted. And it's a totally different position to be in going forward in the season. They're gonna be on primetime a lot this year. 
- [Dan] They are. 
- [Damien] Let's see what they can do with it. 
- [Mike] The one thing we didn't see on that graphic was the lack of experience with their head coach Freddie Kitchens, and I believe one day Freddie Kitchens will be a head coach. But one year ago, guys, he was a position coach. It's like learning how to drive a car going 90 miles an hour in the left-hand lane. And in the division, you have John Harbaugh and Mike Tomlin. Since 2007, Mike Tomlin has the second most wins in the NFL, John Harbaugh has the sixth most wins. So, from a coaching standpoint, Cleveland is a distant third behind those two rivals. And how Freddie Kitchens can meld that group will be interesting to watch. 
- Interesting to watch, what we have coming still on NFL Live today. We're going to have more on the Ezekiel Elliott situation. Cowboys running back not suspended by the NFL for his recent incident. And because tomorrow is Independence Day, we're going to talk about the great independent NFL plays of all-time. Stick around to see what that's all about.

Ezekiel Elliott, the Cowboys running back will not be punished. The league found that he did not violate the personal conduct policy in an incident involving a security guard in Las Vegas recently. The NFL interviewed Ezekiel Elliott on Tuesday. They also spoke with his girlfriend who was there at the time of the incident. And have determined that he will not face punishment. Guys, we've had a lot of conversation about this, but one real quick sort of wrap up on the upshot of Ezekiel Elliott today. 
- You flirted with fire again, you know, you've been fortunate. Now it's just focus on the upcoming season. 
- And for the Dallas Cowboys, this is a really important day, let's get it wrapped up. We put it behind us, it's before July 4th, now we can get to training camp. It's one less distraction to worry about. And now they can focus on the Philadelphia Eagles and trying to win the NFC East this year. 
- Mike, thanks for the help with the segue. Tomorrow is, in fact, July 4th, and it's called Independence Day. So before you fire up your grills, or dig your feet too far into that sand, we wanted to take you through some of our favorite independent plays in NFL history. These are plays where one guy did it all on his own or independently. How about Pat McAfee and the Colts 2014 against the Texans. The kickoff, there's no coverage at midfield, so he recovers it himself. 
- [Damien] That's a smart play right there by Pat McAfee. 
- [Dan] 2009, Bills-Titans in the Hall of Fame Game, Titans Punter AJ Trapasso takes the snap, but it's a fake punt and Trapasso's just gonna take it all the way. 
- Got some wheels. 
- [Mike] There is no tackling in preseason. 
- [Damien] No. 
- [Dan] How much fun did he have there? Number eight, 1997 Vikings-Panthers. Vikings quarterback Brad Johnson throws the pass but it's batted back to him and sure I'll take it. He's gonna run it right in for a touchdown on his own. Denny Green liked it. 
- [Mike] Brad Johnson very underrated career at quarterback. 
- Absolutely. 
- No question. Number seven, Marcus Mariota, this is the 2017 Wild Card Game, Titans-Chiefs, I was there for that one too. Mariota scrambles, throws, but gets knocked right back to him by Darrell Revis, and he'll go ahead and score it himself. Big comeback that day for Tennessee. Number six, 2017 49ers against the Bears, the punt and Tarik Cohen corrals it, takes it from the 40 and he's not just gonna let himself get tackled here, right? 
- [Damien] I mean, he's outrunning the coverage. 
- [Dan] He had a plan and he stuck to it, and look at this, it's gonna pay off for him. 
- [Mike] I'll tell you, him and Jakeem Grant are two of the most dynamic players in the open field. They're fast, they're quick, and they're hard to tackle. 
- [Dan] Speaking of fast. How about Mike Vick, 2002 Falcons-Vikings, tied at 24 in overtime. Vick, play action, gets outside, and no one's gonna catch him, come on are you kidding me? 
- [Damien] This is like a walk-off home run right here. This was it, this was the signature play. 
- [Dan] The overtime game. This is my personal favorite guy. Number four, 1991 Cowboys-Lions. The one and only Barry Sanders rushing up the side and somehow gets out of this mess. Oh, they're just not gonna catch him. 
- [Mike] Boy, you're talking about stopping on a dime. 
- [Dan] That's ridiculous. 
- [Damien] I take it those pictures are not in HD. 
- [Dan] No, definitely not. Barry deserved it but it was too soon. Deion Sanders, 1989 Falcons versus Rams. He drops the punt but he recovers, and he's gonna take it back. This is his first punt return touchdown. I do not know if he also played baseball for the Atlanta Braves that night, but I know he did at some point. So, very versatile, independent kind of player. Deion Sanders, he's going all the way. 
- [Damien] Oh, he's gonna high-step it into the endzone. Speed kills. 
- On the independent plays. Number two is a Super Bowl play. Super Bowl XLIII, you remember if you were a Steelers fan. James Harrison against the Cardinals. It's first and goal for the Cards. Kurt Warner is intercepted by James Harrison. Yes, he's gonna, he's gonna run it all the way back. 
- [Mike] When he catches the ball, you're like there's no way he can score on this, there's no way. There's too many guys that should be able to track him down. 
- [Dan] Those Instagram workouts. 
- [Damien] How do you let him tightrope the sideline like that? Man, that's awful. 
- Just push him out. 
- [Dan] Big guy, though, kind of hard to push him out. Plus you've got like offensive linemen trying to run him down. 
- Oh. 
- Oh! 
- [Damien] Dan, what was all that about? 
- [Dan] 2011 NFC Wild Card Game, Saints-Seahawks. Good offensive line work here, but Marshawn Lynch did a lot of this on his own. Runs up the middle breaks tackles left and right, stiff arm. Beastquake, Beast Mode. That was what a 7-9 Seahawks team beating a defending Super Bowl Champion Saints team. 
- Yep. 
- His balance for his size was remarkable, he has incredible feet. 
- Crazy, so those are the independent plays.
