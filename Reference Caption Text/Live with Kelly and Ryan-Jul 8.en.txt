[Music] Blame it on my juice, baby [Music] [Music] Ain't my fault that I'm out here making news [Music] [Music] I'm the pudding in the proof [Music] [Music] Gotta blame it on my juice [Music] 
- Hi there, how you doin' today? [Music] Blame it on my juice [Music] [Music] Blame it on my juice [Music] [Music] Blame it on my juice baby [Music] [Music] 
- Hey. [Music] 
- Happy Birthday, congratulations. 
- Thank you all very much. 
- Stop. 
- [Both] We haven't done anything yet. 
- Great minds think. We've been waiting two weeks to say that. 
- Together at the same time. Monday, July 8, 2019, good morning. 
- Hi, good morning. 
- You look... 
- I'm still jet-lagged. I've been up 
- You look great. 
- Since three o'clock this morning. How about you? 
- Oh, well, we're almost done. 
- Yeah, I know, I know, I know. 
- In just than, less than an hour. 
- Very, very jet-lagged. It's funny, the older you get the harder it is to flip over, I feel like. You know what I mean? 
- Yeah, like when I go back and forth, east to west. When I do that every week, when I was younger, it was easier. Now, it's painful. 
- Painful. 
- But you were on a European jet lag, right? 
- Yes, yes, I'm on European jet lag. 
- So it's dinner time. 
- I'm starving. I wanna eat pasta right now. 
- Oh my gosh, how was it? 
- It was great. Let me, can I show you, can I bore you with some photos? You know how I love to show you my-
- Yeah, you're welcome. Let me just say that we went home to the house where my husband grew up as a small child, okay? So we went to the house. This was not his birthplace house. This is where they moved when he was a small kid. I don't know how old he is in this photo. I'm gonna say like four or five years old. This is where they moved. This tiny little beach town in southern Italy. This one over here is my adorable husband, right there. That's his brother, Mike and that's my sister-in-law, Adriana. There's my mother-in-law right there. Sorry about my fingernails. They look ridiculous, but these were vacation fingernails. And that's my grandfather-in-law, who has passed away, may he rest in peace. 
- What a beautiful picture. 
- So we recreated it with our group, so there we are in front of the house. They were on the inside of the fence here. We're on the outside of the fence. 
- We rang the bell and nobody was home. Nobody was home but there we are. It was just very emotional to go back and to have these photos and to picture my-
- 
- What was Mark's reaction when he got back? 
- He was very emotional. He goes, It's exactly the same, except the trees have gotten bigger. It's exactly as he remembered it. We pulled up in a minivan, as we (video blips) and we... everything is like a tiny little car, so we looked like we were in a truck. And when we pulled into the street, he goes, Everybody's going to come out of the front door or hang over the terraces. And like clockwork, it was like.. 
- Oh, look at the tourists. 
- Hmm, hmm. And it was just, we started playing a game, count the nonnas on the terrace. I'm like, how many nonnas do you think we're gonna see on the terrace? The kids were like, We'll see 12 nonnas on the terraces. So anyway, I took some pictures of my husband because I love to photograph him on vacation-
- 
- He's shirtless. 
- He is shirtless, yes. There he is here. Yep, mmm hmmm. You're welcome America and Canada, you're welcome, yes. 
- It's depressing. 
- Plus, my kids, he's by the way, I just want to point out in this photo, he's surrounded by my children, who will no longer let me post photos of them, so there he is. Here we are, we got a little lost, he refused to ask for directions, but he thought he could just find it himself. 
- It looks like an ad, doesn't it? It looks like an ad for sun 
- Isn't that great? 
- It's like a Ray-Ban ad. 
- Yeah, it's great. 
- I had no idea my picture's being taken. 
- Here he is with his, there we are. 
- See? 
- Yep. 
- There he is with my doppleganger son of his, like the two twins. 
- They look like boys. 
- There they are the boys. 
- Yeah. Here they are at a wall of bougainvillea. Finally, I said to him, Hey, will you do me a favor, because I'm gonna show some of these pictures on the air, will you take a picture of me, because I just want to be able to prove that I was on this trip. And so he did, he took a picture of me. I don't know if you can see it. That's me. If you look past the flowers, that's me floating on a pool float. It's like a giant pillow. They called it a ravioli. I'm not kidding, they call it the floating ravioli. But that's the one picture he took of me. There it is. Then I just wanted to show you snakes. There were also snakes on this trip. They were free. You didn't even have to pay extra for the snakes. 
- You sent me a text, you said one word, snakes and I said oh okay. 
- He was like, what does that mean, snakes? There are snakes. 
- What does that mean, 
- everywhere? 
- I don't know why they keep finding me. People were like, no, there are no snakes here. I go, I am photographing snakes. 
- There's actually a second photo of you here. If you take a closer look, I think that's you in the shadow there, isn't it? 
- Oh yeah that's me. 
- That's me. 
- Thank you. 
- Good shot. 
- Thanks though. 
- [Man] Very muscular. 
- Yeah, you look very fit in that silhouette. 
- My shadows are very muscular. 
- Your shadows look great. 
- My shadows have a lot of curves. 
- Mark didn't capture you, but he captured your shadow. 
- He did that, I captured my own shadow. Mark took a picture of plants. 
- Plants with someone on a floating ravioli. 
- I accidentally drifted by on a pool float. How was your vacation? 
- It was great. 
- 'Cause you were gone a long time. 
- I was gone a long time as well. I had to go overseas for a little convention for the radio show, which was in Cannes. Then I went back to L.A. for a day. Then I went to Greece to get some sun afterwards. 
- Greece is the word. 
- It's just beautiful, the people are great, the food is great, but during all of this, something, you know, because I've got this niece now, every first is a big deal in the family so my sister, she was so nervous about traveling with baby Flora for the first time on the plane. So here they are. I just wanna show you, this is Jimmy and Meredith and Flora on their first flight. 
- Adorable. 
- And she was so concerned about how Flora was gonna do, was she gonna manage, was she gonna be a mess, was she gonna be screaming and crying. Well looks like she enjoyed herself. 
- I can't believe she is my size. 
- She's our size. 
- She is our size. That is the outfit I wore on the show last week. 
- I was gonna say. (laughs) One of the things I discovered, because you know, I love to eat and snack, especially when I'm on vacation. I took the clocks out of my room so I didn't know what time it was in the middle of the night or what time it was in the morning, so I slept 'til I woke up. It's the greatest thing ever. 
- You slept until I texted you. 
- Snakes. 
- Pictures of snakes. 
- Leave me alone. But you know, you and Mark have PB and Js all the time. I had every day, every day on vacation, a PBJB. Have you had that? 
- What's a PBJB? 
- Peanut butter, jelly and bacon. You're welcome as well, America and Canada. I leave you with this treat today. Make yourself a PBJB, peanut butter jelly ba. You're shaking, are you cited? 
- I'm so cited about that. 
- This is what you guys should be making every night. 'Cause Mark loves to eat these in bed, right? 
- Oh my God, it's his favorite thing. But you know what's so funny is? We were in Corsica first and then we went to Italy and we did not have access. I mean, I'm sure we could have conjured up access to peanut butter and jelly, but we like to eat local. We like to eat what local people eat, so we were having lots of 
- Olive butter. 
- Fresh food. Fresh fish and fresh, we had pasta every day and it was homemade and we went to a farm where they make the burrata and it was incredible. We did the whole thing. And he, of course, because he was without peanut butter and jelly for two weeks, lost five pounds. 
- 'Cause he needed to. 
- He lost five pounds. 
- Yeah, you saw him in that shot. 
- Just skipping peanut butter and jelly. It's so irritating. 
- We'll start sneaking in, no kidding, I know. I mean, start sneaking the bacon in there. He'll regain it. 
- Just slide it right in. 
- Just slide it right in. He'll never notice. 
- See if he notices. 
- He'll never notice. Lots of news over the last couple days. These two earthquakes in southern California, big deal. Real serious. There was two back-to-back, basically and the last one, 7.1, which is eight times stronger than the first one. 
- Eleven times. 
- Eleven times, stronger than the first one, right? 
- That's so interesting, 'cause I was watching that on CNN. They were explaining it. 
- The decimal, right? 
- So you go, okay, so first one was 6.4, 
- The Richter. 
- And then the 7.1, you go, oh, it's not that much. It doesn't seem like that much big of a shift and apparently-
- 
- It's exponential. 
- It's exponential. It's that times. 
- Yeah, every decimal is that full amount times. 
- Times whatever. 
- So it is significant. Have you been? I've been in them before. I was not there for the Northridge one, I had not moved to L.A. yet. 
- Oh, you're kidding. 
- But I have been there for smaller ones, threes and fours and even those scare ya. 
- My son was out in California, my oldest son, and he was in L.A. proper, but he said they could feel the earthquakes. They felt them. 
- You kinda, after you feel one, you stop sleeping naked because you just never know when you're gonna have to run into the door jamb, right? 
- [Man] Shoes by the side of the bed. 
- Shoes by the side of the bed. But here, it's safe to sleep naked. 
- Well, it depends on whose house you're in. 
- Well generally, I like to sleep in my own. 
- I mean, don't sleep naked in my house, 'cause the kids will walk in at any second. They'll be, Don't you ever put clothes on? And I'm like, Don't you knock? Anyway, it's so interesting. There's so much to talk about in sports. I mean, the Women's Soccer 
- Incredible, so great. 
- I, who don't watch, watched and I said, I cannot believe I've been missing this sport for so many years. 
- It's incredible, right? 
- Yeah. You know, my husband and my kids always watch soccer and I just drifted in and out. God, they are so, so good. 
- So good. 
- So good. 
- I was so just unabashedly happy for them. 
- Well, they're gonna be celebrated. I think Wednesday there's a big parade here in the city. 
- Yes, that would be downtown. 
- Downtown, yeah. Then, Alex, Alex Morgan, she's nominated for Best Female Athlete at the ESPYs, which also airs on Wednesday, right? 
- [Man] Yeah. 
- Incredible. 
- On ABC, yeah. 
- Fabulous. 
- So congratulations to that team. If you haven't been watching, you've been missing. Did you watch any of the tennis? Did you see Coco? 
- I know, so I don't follow tennis, but Mark keeps saying, oh my God, you've gotta follow tennis because there's this young girl named Coco, is it Gauff? Who is 15 years old and is really on this winning streak at Wimbledon. So I have a 16-year-old son and my daughter, who just turned 18, and-
- 
- You just picturing it, thinking about it. 
- You picture them at 15. Any 15-year-olds here, 15? Hi, hi there. So 15, give me the rundown. What are you into? 
- [Girl] Backstreet Boys. 
- Backstreet Boys? 
- You're into the Backstreet boys. 
- It's so funny, we were too as teenagers. 
- Somebody down here was yelling, what are you into? 
- [Girl] Dance. 
- You're into dance? 
- Dance? 
- Are you a competitive dancer? 
- No. 
- Don't clam up now. This is your big moment. 
- [Girl] We love to dance. We also love musical theater and acting and singing. 
- [Ryan] Musical theater, acting and singing. 
- Okay, all right. So, I want you to picture that you're-
- 
- You're at the Oscars. 
- You're at the Oscars and you're on stage. 
- And you've just accepted. 
- And this is for all the marbles. You're about to win the Academy Award and you're 15. How do you feel? Are you freaking out? 
- [Girls] Yes. 
- This girl has no freak-out, apparently. She does not freak out. 
- She's so poised. 
- It's amazing to see, as you were saying, a 15-year-old with that kind of poise and the talent and the skill, but I too, I mean, I don't have kids, but I too was thinking about just like how-
- 
- I can't get them to hang up their towel on a hook. 
- Yeah, how disciplined, how disciplined one must be as a young child. 
- Hang up your towel on a hook so it doesn't get mildewed. You can use a towel more than once. Right? 
- Just 'cause my mom used to say that, I now leave them on the floor, just to spite. 
- You just deliberately leave them on the floor. 
- Yeah, then I have to pick them up. 
- Atta boy. 
- I can't remember in years past, I was watching some of the Wimbledon and they split screen action. They're very, they assume-
- 
- [Man] They do have more of that that we have a lot of capacity as viewers, 'cause they're watching two matches at the same time. 
- What do you mean? You mean they play two matches? I thought they split screen so you don't have to do this the whole time. 
- No, they split screen two action shots. They did, I was like. They're very ambitious and they think that I have a lot of capacity to understand what's going on but you can watch two matches at once. I had not seen that before. I've seen the split where they're volleying but this was a split of live action, two different courts. Really challenging. I was exhausted-
- 
- Right. 
- after watching. 
- It sounds exhausting. And the whole scoring system is always challenging for me. Because it goes in, what is it, 15. It goes by 15. 
- [Man] Oh yeah, 15, 30. 
- Until you get to 40. 
- Yeah, and I'm like, I don't know what comes next. 
- Add in, add out, your love, my love, our love, we love. Today, we love the show. Today on the show, Kumail Nanjiani is with us. He's got a great new movie. It's very funny, Stuber. We'll see him again. 
- And Bernadette Peters is back. She's brought some pups who are up for adoption. 
- There is a lab mix. 
- Are you looking? 
- I'm not looking, but there's a lab mix and I'm a sucker for a lab. And we're gonna see if we know the facts about our dogs when we play a game of Truth or Tail. 
- Get it? 
- I got it. 
- Get it? 
- But now it's time for Stump the Hosts travel trivia. Let's do it. 
- [Audience] Stump the Hosts. [Music] Yeah, yeah, yeah [Music] [Music] (foreign language) [Music] [Music] Don't stop the party [Music] [Music] Yeah, yeah, yeah [Music] 
- Oh yeah. Christine Mills from Bohemia, is that right? Bohemia, Long Island. 
- Yay, woo hoo. 
- [Ryan] Long Island. 
- Bohemia, that sounds like where I wanna live. 
- [Christine] It's very exotic. 
- Yeah. 
- Yeah, you're very bohemian. 
- All right, today, both our studio audience and you watching at home can weigh in on which statement you think is true. Go to KELLYANDRYANNOW.COM to vote and just for voting, you could have a chance to win your own Kelly & Ryan mug. 
- Oh, look at it. 
- There she is. 
- Look at her. 
- Just look at it's majesty. 
- So we've got Mitzi Hovre from Dripping Springs, Texas on the phone, who watches us on KVUE. Good morning, Mitzi, how are you? 
- [Mitzi] Hi, I'm good. How are y'all? 
- We're great. 
- We're good, thanks. 
- What are you up to this morning? 
- [Mitzi] Good. Oh, I was just fixing to go running with my daughter and y'all called, so I get to take the day off. 
- Were you gonna go running? 
- [Mitzi] Yeah, I was gonna go running, but now I don't have to. = No, you can still run. This won't take long. 
- I just want you to know, this phone call is gonna take about two minutes. 
- You shouldn't blow off your run for this. As a matter of fact, we'll speed it up right now so you can get to it. 
- [Mitzi] Okay. 
- We've got 
- two statements from Mitzi. We're trying to guess which one is true. If you stump us, you win the mug, okay? 
- [Mitzi] Okay. 
- First of her statements, when I was younger, I could stick my entire fist in my mouth. 
- Oh, I know somebody that can do that. 
- [Mitzi] You do? 
- Yeah, I do, I do. 
- You can call me by my name. 
- [Mitzi] Oh yeah. 
- Can you do that too? I've never tried it. If anything, now is not the time. Or, I made it to the semi-finals of the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader tryouts. 
- Oh my gosh, I so wanna believe that. 
- [Mitzi] Oh. (laughs) 
- Okay, so I'm looking at you. I'm trying to figure out, I wish your hand was in this photo So I could see your mouth to fist ratio. 
- So she could scale it. 
- [Mitzi] Really we can, yeah. 
- Okay, so what was the key to making it to the semi-finals in the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleader tryouts? 
- [Mitzi] Well, you had to have your own vignette and you had to do it for 90 seconds and my aunt was a, she was a dancer, so she taught me a dance ahead of time and then you had to go and perform and you did it as a group and everybody just, they played music and you just kind of dance around. I knew what I was gonna do, so I did that. 
- Hmmm. 
- Suspect. 
- Okay. 
- [Man] Discover her. 
- Yeah, how did you discover your talent? 
- Yeah, how'd you discover your fist-
- 
- Oh shoot. 
- Talent. 
- How'd you discover your fist talent? 
- [Mitzi] You know, I don't know. I just used to do that and a boy in my junior high, he did it too and so we got put, our pictures got put in the yearbook puttin' our fists in our mouths. Then I had to quit in high school. I guess my fists got a little bit big, 'cause I started ripping the sides of my mouth. 
- [Man] Ow. 
- That sounds dangerous. 
- This is taking a dark turn. 
- Let's see, what does the audience think? What do you guys think? Wow. See, okay, so okay. I used to watch that show, you know, about the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleader tryouts, they had a show on, y'all-
- 
- Y'all remember? 
- Y'all wanna say y'all, y'all remember that show? 
- Y'all remember that? 
- And I remember them having a very choreographed routine that they had to memorize in like one second. I don't remember that being able to freestyle. 
- I agree, and I thought-
- 
- [Mitzi] You know, the freestyle is the very beginning one. That's the pre-round, and then the semi-finals is when they teach you a dance 
- Now we're in trouble. 
- [Mitzi] and then you do a kick routine 
- [Man] All right, lock it in guys. Lock it in. 
- and you're 
- [Mitzi] Performing in front of the judges. 
- But that's not what you said when I questioned you under intensive questioning, Mitzi. 
- [Man] Lock it in. 
- Remember, I said. 
- I was right here. 
- Right, you were here for it. 
- I was here, I was right here. 
- We were all right here, the witnesses. 
- All right, what are we going with? 
- I don't know. 
- Originally I thought-
- 
- I wanna say fist in mouth. 
- That's what I thought too. 
- And because I'm looking at her great, beautiful, wide smile, 
- Which also could work to the cheerleading thing, but I think it's fist in mouth, guys. 
- We're going against the audience. 
- What do you thinK? 
- Is it fist in mouth? 
- [Mitzi] That's true. 
- Got it. Go with the gut always, right? You haven't lost it, you got it. 
- I still got it. 
- Well, even though you didn't win the mug, we're gonna spin the wheel and see what you're playing for here. Still got it. 
- Be nice though if you could do that, yeah. 
- All right, what do we have? 
- Ooh, this is a great prize. The JW Marriott Cancun Resort and Spa in Mexico. Seven days, six nights in a premium ocean-view room. It includes $1400 food and beverage credit, a spa treatment per person. It's a prize valued at $7500. You have 20 seconds and only one guess, Mitzi. Good luck. 
- [Mitzi] Okay, thanks. 
- Okay, Mitzi, on Friday's show, we talked with Ricky Gervais. In what town outside London did Ricky say he lives? 
- [Mitzi] Okay, what town? Oh, it was Hampstead. 
- You got it. 
- Yes.

- Hi, hi, good to see you. 
- Good to see you. 
- Good to see you again. Welcome back. 
- Thank you. Guys, why is it so smoky in here? What is going on? 
- Thank you for noticing. Apparently, they are special effects for our trivia game. 
- You can injure a lot of people with this fist in mouth chat. 
- Do you know it? 
- Can I do that? 
- Yeah, I'm asking. 
- No. 
- I'm not gonna try it, nice try. No. 
- Now you, as I shook your hand, I notice that you've got-
- ...don't believe that it's a flying saucer. I believe that it's an unidentified flying object, which could be-
- 
- Well, you think like a saucer and a teacup. 
- Yeah, no. 
- It's not that. 
- No, I don't believe that they-
- 
- We are arguing about the shape of it? 
- I believe that there, I don't even, and the military says that they don't know but I think they have to know, right? 
- I like that you're air-quoting everything. They don't know but they have to know. 
- But they have to know. 
- But they, yeah, whisper. Whisper, they won't hear us. Did you recently throw the first pitch at the baseball game? 
- I threw the first pitch, yeah. 
- [Ryan] Did it go over the plate? 
- [Kelly] Okay, wait, wait, wait. 
- [Kumail] It went over the plate. 
- Okay, can we show that picture one more time? That looks like a staged photo, like they almost superimposed your head onto an action shot. 
- Yeah, I'm in front of a green screen. I threw out the first pitch. 
- That's a great shot. 
- That photographer was amazing. Every picture from there, I look like Robert Redford or something. 
- It's terrifying, isn't it? I've done a night. 
- How did it go for you? 
- It didn't go over the plate. 
- Mmmm. 
- What about you? 
- It went over the plate. Well, it didn't-
- 
- Good for you. 
- Thank you Daddy. Thank you Daddy. 
- Daddy, we're gonna talk to Daddy. More with Kumail about what it's like to attend his first WWE wrestling match, right after the plug. Stay with us. 
- [Announcer] Still ahead on Live, Bernadette Peters. 
- From WGLA 24-7 News, this is Good Morning Washington. On your side. We begin with a breaking news alert. 
- And we are following breaking news right now. Just an immense amount of rain hitting the DMV right now. Let's get right out to John Gonzalez, who's in Arlington, and last time we checked in with him, just some incredible images. That red car behind you, John, submerged and it looks like personal belongings coming out of the doors and into the water. Good morning. 
- Just a good morning and a scary situation. Many scary situations this morning throughout the entire D.C. area. You know, we started off reporting this morning in Boyds, Maryland, doing something completely unrelated on the Women's World Cup and the storm came through there first and it continued down the I-270 corridor and now it is coming through Arlington and the D.C. city with this unbelievable amount of rain and take a look. This is Kennebec Street and 11th here in Arlington and you can see that car, that Hundai, is almost completely submerged. There was a call. We were hearing the scanners, the emergency scanners, and there was a call reported for a woman on top of a stranded vehicle. We believe that's the case here, so the woman is no longer in the vehicle, no longer on the roof of the vehicle, so we are hoping that she's been able to get some help. That's the hope, and now that car is just submerged, but you can see just all of the standing water here and this happened in a matter of minutes. I mean, we're talking torrential rain, just too much rain in a short period of time overwhelmed the area and you can see that car is now reversing. You hear it all the time, I know it sounds cliche, folks, turn around, don't drown. Well here's a perfect situation, a perfect example of what we talk about when we say that on the air. Here's a small vehicle, another sedan similar to the one that's stuck just to the right of us, trying to get through that standing water here right next to Westover Park and they are having to now reverse, a very good idea, but they're gonna have to do that carefully because you've got just as much standing water now behind them. Back to this vehicle here, red Hundai, you see the bag on top of the roof, Steve Rudin. We're hoping for the best. We're hoping that the news is good, that this woman was able to get out without any injuries. We don't see any paramedics or first responders right here directly where this vehicle is. They are up the hill a bit, but just a scary situation, Steve. Just too much rain. The manhole is just completely overwhelmed. The sewer system just can't take this much rain. 
- All right John. If we could just stay on this picture here for a moment, and this is exactly what flash flooding is. If you look at the topography, you'll notice that it's sort of in a low-lying area here and when we looked over toward the right earlier, you could see there was a bit of a hill, so all this water is cascading downward and it's all pooling in this one location and this is exactly what flash flooding is all about. It doesn't take very long, it happens in a flash and it could happen in a minute, it could happen in two minutes and this is why you don't go across the roads. You just don't know how deep the water is. You might say to yourself or think, hey I've traveled this route over and over again. There's no problems at all. It looks like it's two or three inches. Before you know it, it's six inches, it's ten inches, it's two feet of water, and once you get that much water, your car is going to be shot and it's not gonna be working and it's not a good thing. Johnny G, we'll let him talk to that person but this is what it looks like right now over toward Tenleytown and upper northwest D.C., National Harbor. Heavy rain continues to fall. This has now been going on for what 20, 25 minutes with those torrential downpours. 395 heading into the city, at least traffic is getting in but I do think that because of the timing of this storm, the heavy rainmaker, that a lot of folks have put off leaving to go to work and a lot of people, thank goodness, are still on vacation because they're enjoying the long holiday weekend. The Whitehurst looking good, at least in terms of movement. Both directions headed over toward Georgetown and this right here is over toward K Street and the Kennedy Center. Flash flood warning does continue. All areas inside and close to the Capital Beltway, whether you are in Silver Spring or Wheaton or if you are in Anacostia, Oxen Hill, National Harbor, Capitol Hill, you get the point. Lots of wet weather on the way. All this slowly drifts on off toward the south. Alexandria about another half hour to 45 minutes and then you are going to start to dry out. Along with the heavy rain, you may hear a few rumbles of thunder, so if you're going to be driving about, definitely use extreme caution. Let's over to Veronica. 
- A good portion of our area under a flash flood emergency right now and this could last as late as two to 3 p.m. today with the storms that have been moving through with the pockets of moderate and some very heavy rain. Flooding really is the main issue over the next couple of hours. I wanna go back to this graphic, 'cause it really shows the amount of rain that we have received in some portions of our area, not over a 12-hour period but over in just an hour to an hour and a half. You're looking at some of the roadways there, Bradley River there, where the water has at times been high. We've seen that high water in many locations throughout Montgomery County, upwards two three, four, close to five inches of rain. There's a look at McLean, close to five inches of rain, which is why we've seen those water rescues occurring. If it hasn't been high water covering the roads near you, it's been about the low visibility, not just from the rainfall rates, which have been high, about one to two inches per hour, but also the fog, that fog deck really thickening up now. Okay, so here's the latest on radar. This is the area that we've been tracking over the last two, three hours and you can see it right here, now moving just south and east of the district, that southeast side of the beltway right now, through Prince George's County, through Anne Arundel County but also now Charles County seeing some of that heavy rain and eventually, this is going to be passing off to the northeast, so we may see improving conditions, but keep in mind the roads in many instances have been covered with water, ponding with a lot of road spray, but also the rivers and streams. They're gonna continue to rise. What's an interesting feature right here with this weather boundary across the area, you see this right here, you've got this heavy rain coming south and east and then this area throughout Prince George's County, throughout Calvert and Saint Mary's, coming north. That's convergent. That's right along the front and that means that all that moisture in the atmosphere is pooling right along this weather boundary near us. So for Fairfax, for the district right now, just south of Bowie down 301, down to 95 and areas east of Manassas, that's where the heaviest rain is right now. These are the rainfall rates at upwards two inches per hour. Look at the visibility out there right now. This is just one of the cameras, as we have one out just a little bit showing you the Capitol in the distance where the visibilities have dropped under a half mile. Alexandria, you're seeing that heavy rain right now. Mount Vernon and areas toward Clinton, soon heading into Brandywine, soon heading into Indian Head and soon also Waldorf, right down 301. So if you live in this area here throughout Charles County throughout Saint Mary's and Calvert County, I'd say, don't get on the road right now. If you can, wait about another hour and a half to two hours. Maybe you've got a doctor's appointment somewhere. Maybe your kids have summer camp. I tell you what folks, they're better off inside and so are you. You're seeing these dark, shaded counties. That's western Howard County under a flash flood warning. That is until 11:45 p.m. Look at Montgomery County, Gaithersburg, Germantown, Damascus area over toward Potomac Falls, as well as Laurel. This also, your county under a flash flood warning. That continues too up until 11:15, so many of these going as late as noon and as mentioned, right down south throughout Charles County and areas soon to be Saint Mary's and Calvert County that are gonna go a little longer. Hard to see there. I wanna go back to that shot because really the bridge, the Woodrow Wilson Bridge, obscured in the distance. This is our National Harbor camera and you can see even the top of the wheel there really obscured by the low cloud deck, the visibility and the rain that has just been pouring across the area. Here's a look at the Capitol and another look at the radar. Right now in the District, you folks, if you're in Westin, if you're in Adelphi, if you're in Bowie, you may see some improvement right now with that rain that has just been pouring, but for again, any of you, if you live near some creeks, streams, rivers, know that the water still could be rising quite high. All this kind of flowing from north to south. Heavy rain continues across the area. There's our I-270 camera around Clarksburg Road, but sitting not too far from me is Adriana Hopkins and Mel, who's been with us all morning long as well, keeping an eye on what's been happening on social media with this heavy rain that of course we told you about early this morning on Good Morning Washington. 
- Absolutely, Veronica and this is where we really want to encourage everyone to follow our team on social media because we do have people all over the place. As they were driving into work, they got caught in this rain and storm We have people, our crews, that we've sent out to look for these areas where the roads are flooded and where there might be some water rescues happening right now. So really, 
- We were actually on the air earlier and nothing was happening. We were talking about we're expecting rain and then all of the sudden, sometime in the eight o'clock hour, the rain started falling very heavily and as Sam Sweeney, our live reporter, showed us, he was out in Potomac and Montgomery County, and the flash flooding just came up so suddenly on some of these back roads. They're totally washed out. 
- [Adriana] Absolutely, and looking here at the pictures in the video that we have from earlier this morning, this is the GW Parkway that you're looking at right here and you can see just how much water there is on the roads and how this, as you said, Melanie, happened immediately. We knew that this was happening. We knew it was coming, but it all of a sudden just came in torrential waves of water. This is in North Potomac right here. When I say follow our team on social media, if you follow John Gonzalez right now, you can see that he is tweeting his view from Arlington right now. He says, There's a lot of lightening. There is torrential rain. He said that manholes there are overwhelmed and they've experienced a number of road closures. There are people tweeting on social media about our Metro. Virginia Square Metro Station has a major water leak right now. Here's a video right now of Arlington. You can see the visibility there is extremely poor. The FAA has tweeted out this morning that there are several major airports affected by this weather, from Miami and Fort Lauderdale all the way up north to LaGuardia and those airports that could experience delays, they do include Reagan and Dulles as well. Montgomery County dealing with a lot of creeks and streams that are overflowing with water. This right here is right outside of our studios here in Ross and you can see people trying to make their way with these umbrellas, but again, this rain is heavy and it is swift, and just people trying to run through it and get to some dry space. 
- It doesn't seem like with this system, Veronica hasn't mentioned anything about thunderstorms or lightening or any high winds. It simply has been a lot of water coming down and causing flooding problems. Our John Gonzalez is out live for us right now. John, where are you and it looks like we've got a water rescue behind you going on. 
- Yeah, well here's the situation. The first responders were here, Melanie, the Arlington County Fire Department, but they've moved on. They've got so many calls, they made sure that everyone here in this neighborhood is safe and they've moved on but you can see what was left behind. You have neighbors helping the driver of this vehicle, trying to get her belongings out of the vehicle. A couple of minutes ago, a couple of guys were gonna try to push the car back. Not so sure that's a good idea, but this is the young lady here, the driver, with the pink jacket. She tells me that the car was actually parked and she came out to try to move it because she saw the rain coming in strong and the waters starting to pick up and she couldn't move it in time. So, that's the situation here on Kennebec Street and 11th. You have a tremendous amount of standing water. Just flash flooding at it's best here and take a look at here. This is next to the apartment building. You have the kiddos looking out, witnessing something pretty dramatic and you can see the walkway here. The stairwell is completely flooded that leads to their apartments and just so much rain. That's what we've been talking about this morning. Just so much rain in a short period of time and a tremendous amount of flooding and you've also got lightening. This is right next to the Westover Park, just to give you a lay of the land. In fact, John, if you pan over to the ball field, you can see the outfield of the baseball field completely under water and you have now several cars that were parked here on Kennebec that are now under water. Some of the water is receding. This vehicle not as submerged as it was when we first arrived about 20 minutes ago. That's the good news with some of these storms. You get the water comes in, the flash flooding, and then the waters recede pretty quickly, but it's very, very dangerous. We saw a man trying to go down the road here. He quickly realized not a good idea and he reversed. We were able to talk to him on camera. He says he had an appointment he had to get to but he realized it was just way too dangerous, not worth it, and you can see some of these vehicles are literally turning around as they see the standing water here at 11th and Kennebec in Arlington. All of this started in the Boyds, Maryland area, Frederick County, and it moved down the I-270 corridor. We were actually live up there, doing a story on the women winning the World Cup, and the storm was almost following us as we came back down into Arlington and here you have it now, coming through Arlington and D.C. Just a tremendous amount of rain. A very scary situation here but the good news is the driver is okay. 
- Johnny, you mentioned that you've been caught in the rain ever since this morning when you were in Boyds, Maryland and suddenly the rain just poured down on you during one of our live shots. Explain what you have seen so far from that moment, then you moved down to Arlington and then where you are now, how did you see that weather progress and change? 
- You know, we had a live report coming up at around seven o'clock this morning and we saw those clouds moving in and I told my photographer, John, something's about to drop here, we better take some cover and within minutes, the rain just came down, lightening. It's interesting to watch, almost like watching a radar, as we were driving down 270 onto the beltway, we can see the storm behind us, literally following us, and now we are here in Arlington and it caught up to us and this is what it's creating. This is the same kind of situation we were witnessing up north in upper Montgomery County, Gaithersburg, Germantown, a number of road closures because of this very thing, flash flooding, and now it has hit D.C. and Arlington and this is the situation. You've got, not necessarily cars that were on the road driving, but cars that were parked and are now in the middle of the road. That's how powerful this water can be. When you have a tremendous amount of water, the power is just enormous. You have now a gentleman who's pulled up in a pickup truck here. It looks like he's getting ready to help this young lady try to get this car out of here. But just a dramatic scene. When we first got here, we were concerned that there were people inside, maybe children, because you have little stuffed animals that came out of the car, personal belongings that literally floated away. But the good news again, we've been able to talk to the driver, she didn't want to talk on camera, but just a startling morning for her. She says, again, she saw the standing water. She saw the road quickly submerged and she tried to move her car and it was just too late. She did not have enough time. 
- All right, John, you know, we were watching the situation unfold behind you with that car and it's really a little difficult for us to assess just how heavily the rain is coming down looking at the TV screen. What would you say right now? Is it a moderate rainfall? Is is tapering off any? 
- I don't wanna use the word tapering off. It's lighter than it was about 20 minutes ago here in Arlington, but it's still raining a good amount. I don't know if you can see it off the umbrella here. It's still coming down at a good clip. Not torrential, the way we saw it in Boyds this morning and as we came down the I-270 corridor into the beltway, but again, still a tremendous amount of rain. You can probably see it on top of the standing water. The drops falling on the standing water, so that gives you an idea of just how much rain we're still getting, Veronica, in this area. Again, these gentlemen here trying to help this lady, Veronica, were gonna try to move the car on their own and good thing they didn't, because that's never a good idea. 
- Yeah, Johnny, that is actually just an amazing shot. Of course, we've seen some other water rescues going on across the area similar to that. Wanna go ahead and, if we can split the screen again and put the video back up, because one thing I want you to know. I was in Ellicott City, Maryland, for both flash flood events, flash flood emergency events. That's why it's called flash flooding, because it can occur in a flash, where you have that much water that accumulates so quickly. That shot not as dramatic as the shot that we were just seeing there with Johnny Gonzalez, but again, that's the reason that we call it flash flooding; where the water comes up in a hurry has nowhere to go. Especially if you're in an area, if you're traveling through an area or if you live in an area with a lot of concrete, the ground cannot pick up that water. It cannot take in that water and you know, we've had six back-to-back days with heavy rain during the afternoon with some of these summer storms. Well, there's a look at the capital wheel. Again, you're saying what capital wheel? Where is it? It's on the far, left-hand portion of your screen, really hard to see as heavy rain continues through the nation's capital, here in the Capital Metro area and there's a look, in fact, of the Capitol dome. You're seeing just a little bit of it in the distance there in that bright white. What typically is morning for us where by this time we can see a little better, over the last hour and a half to two hours, we've seen that heavy rain make its way through the area. Here's a look at Clarksburg Road. This is I-270, where some of the heaviest has already come through, but I betcha if you're in northern, western Montgomery County, you're probably still seeing the creeks, streams all still continue to come up across the area. Here's a look at the radar loop. You heard Johnny Gonzalez say where he was this morning up in Frederick County, Maryland. This is where he was earlier. He's really traveled with that line down to the south into the metro area, now just south and east about ready to pull into portions of northern Charles County. Look at Dunkirk, still some lightening with that near 301 and south of Bowie, so we may see improvement conditions to the north here around Damascus, around Gaithersburg, Laurel, Ellicott City, but still down to the south, where those flash flood warnings continue and flash flood emergency all the way south now into Charles County just past noon today until 1 p.m., we'll continue to have that threat of flash flooding. Let's go back to Johnny Gonzalez, who has more on that water rescue. 
- And Veronica, we're seeing some progress. Just in the last few minutes, an update. You can see the Hundai Elantra here is now out of the water but well, you can see it's got some drying out to do. This car was almost completely submerged when we arrived, the driver telling us that the car was parked here on Kennebec Street and 11th. She saw the water starting to pick up and she tried to move it but she didn't have enough time and this gentleman here, Mike, came by in his Ford F-150. You didn't get called, you just happened to come across this. 
- No, I was running an errand this morning and I got caught in it and I was stuck in traffic everywhere and then I figured I'd be close to home and then I saw them locked up and I always say it's not bad weather, it's bad preparation, so you always got the gear with you, got the frog togs and just decided to cruise around and see if there is anything I can do in my neighborhood. 
- You made pretty quick work of this. How dangerous is something like this, when you have folks that may be driving. We saw a guy try to get through something like this. You seem like you're maybe more experienced than others in a situation like this. How dangerous can this be? 
- Well, you know, there's always a risk when you're trying to ford a river or any sort of standing water and it's, around here, I figured I know the landscape pretty well, I know how deep the roads are. You can see some certain points, like halfway up a fire hydrant might only be a couple feet deep, so you can use some sort of inferences to know how deep it is, but it's always a risk. Unless you have a larger vehicle, I wouldn't recommend it, especially with some of the smaller, low-profile sedans and whatnot. 
- Mike, thanks so much and again, thanks for helping this young lady get out of the water. John, if you pan the camera, you can see her now trying to collect some of her personal belongings that literally floated out of the vehicle and even in the last couple of minutes since we last talked, Veronica, you can see what I said earlier. These...been talking about the flash flooding and as quickly as it comes through, the water recedes. In about 10 minutes, there's not gonna be any problem here. You're gonna see, not a dry road, but no standing water and that's what's amazing about a situation like this. That quickly, in just a matter of minutes, you can find yourself in a big problem and again, you have vehicles at the top of the hill here on Kennebec trying to, well, they're attempting, but that vehicle there, the black SUV doing the smart thing, turning around, and that white vehicle, there you go. You don't wanna try to cross something like this because it just takes a matter of seconds to get yourself in a lot of trouble. Veronica, back to you inside. 
- That's right and that's why on days when we talk about the possibility of flash flooding, when we say that the area is under a flash flood watch, that's when you need to prepare early in the day and that's why it's a good idea to stay with Storm Watch 7, always have that Storm Watch 7 weather app ready to go. Make sure the notifications are turned on because should there be a flash flood emergency, you bet my phone went off this morning several times with all the warnings and emergencies that we already had. So how much longer, again, until two, 3 p.m. today, big story today is that heavy rain, that very heavy rain that will continue to move through our area. I've put on a couple of amounts here in terms of rainfall of what we've seen already. Look at Addison Height, 2.4 inches of rain. 2.8 inches of rain just south of Hall's Hill area and just north of McLean, close to 5 inches of rain. Again, this not in a 12
- or 24-hour period a lot of times when we show those amounts, but this in an hour to an hour and a half. So all that rain comes up very quickly, comes out of the storm drains where the storm drains can't take the water, so it just sits on the road and increases very quickly. Just in a foot of road, can start to carry your car away in two feet of water very easily. So that much water, don't ever attempt to drive across a flooded road. Look at western portions of Montgomery County there around Rockville. This is just west of 270, 3.4 inches of rain. These are some of the totals throughout and this loop over the last three hours, we're doing a little better here in Loudoun County. In Montgomery County, you heard Johnny Gonzalez just mention how things are starting to improve. The water starting to recede, but it'll take some time perhaps for the creeks, the rivers, the streams, if you live anywhere there. I know your kids out of school today. Maybe they're not at summer camp. Make sure they're not in the backyard playing near those if you live in some of these areas, 'cause again, we've already had a number of water rescues. Your heaviest rain now with some lightening right here, coming through Prince George's County, right around 301, crossing over, making its way very slowly to the east and southeast, so soon Waldorf, soon Dunkirk and eventually Prince Frederick, making its way south from Bowie and south of Annapolis, you folks doing a bit better. So we're gonna see improving conditions on area roads, but that too is going to take awhile. Heavy rain now, Alexandria south to Mount Vernon. That's right down Route One. Some heavy rain too around areas of 301. This is south of Silver Hill and down toward the Clinton area and Franconia, so if you live in these areas, stay put. Treat it just as you would a severe thunderstorm warning or for that matter, any elevated, severe warning that we get on the air and issue for you. This is kind of a life and death situation with so much rain that is falling across the area. For Howard County, you stay under that flash flood warning until 11:45. That's western portions of Howard County but even around Ellicott City and east toward Catonsville or up toward Baltimore. Probably still some ponding on area roads. Then right down the south through the District. That's Bowie, that's down toward Charles County. That is where all this is going. Again, very slowly. This whole again started three hours ago and we're still dealing with a heavy rain across the area. So lets talk about what's next for us. That is maybe some improving visibility by the time we get to noon. Right now it's at a mile and a half in D.C. Just a couple minutes ago, I was on the air showing you a half mile and it's improved to Joint Base Andrews, right now down at a half mile visibility. So throughout the day today, we're gonna stay on a weather alert at least until noon, maybe one, two o'clock before improving conditions. That rain isn't probably gonna end until about three, four o'clock. The rain easing and then eventually clearing. So again, the very latest is several flash flood emergencies continue across the area. I know, Steve Rudin, you're standing by with more on some of the rainfall totals and what's happening on social media right now. 
- Yeah and VJ, before we get to see, we wanna show you, everybody's been talking about this rain and they've been tweeting out some amazing pictures, so let's take a look at some of the flooding that we're seeing around our region, and over on the right side of your screen, it looks like we got a picture of an interstate there and it's just a wet mess. Here, you can see a closer up picture with some ponding and where is this exactly? 
- [Adriana] This is Sam Sweeney's pictures that he's tweeting out on social media. You can follow him at sweeneyabc. Basically, this is right outside of Dulles and the FAA has already sent out a tweet to everyone, letting people know that if you're flying out, check your flight times because they could be delayed. Several areas right now dealing with some bad weather, from Miami and Fort Lauderdale all the way up north to LaGuardia. Reagan and Dulles, the FAA says, could have some delays because of this weather. But this is what you're seeing around Dulles. Just the flash flooding and the flooding there and Steve, you were talking just a minute ago while Veronica was updating everyone in terms of the radar. How much rain have we seen and in how much time? 
- There have been jackpot zones and Veronica and I have been showing you all morning long those jackpot zones in Arlington, over toward McLean, over toward Potomac. Then you head over into eastern Montgomery County, where not as much rain has fallen, but upwards of two to four inches, that is the safe bet right now, but I would not be surprised...
