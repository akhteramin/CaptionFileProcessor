- You are totally off base here. 
- [Announcer] Log on and join our live conversation. 
- I can't believe I'm saying this, I do agree with you. 
- [Announcer] DBL starts right now. 
- [Producer] Three, two. 
- Welcome to Daily Blast Live. It is Tuesday, May 7th, we are live and we're talking about what you're talking about right now. I'm here with Tory, Jeff, Al and I am Sam. Let's get started. We have our brand new interview with pop sensation's Pentatonix, joining us from their first ever world tour. Plus we have wedding guest fashion secrets. We're telling you how you can look your best, without, of course, upstaging the bride, c'mon on now. All that in minutes, the stars brought their craziest, most over-the-top looks ever to this year's Met Gala. The theme was camp, notes of fashion, and everyone was expected to pull out all the stops, but hold up, what is camp? Well, it is defined as the love of the un-natural, of artifice and exaggeration, basically everything that is fabulous, ironic, or extra. So let's get to the fashion, and the title this year for the most lit, definitely goes to Katy Perry, whether ya hate it, or ya like it, she definitely is having people talking. She wore this illuminated chandelier look, it was created for her by Jeremy Scott of Moschino. Kim Kardashian showed off her figure, in this skin tight latex corseted dress, 
- [Jeff] Looks like a bottle of perfume. 
- [Sam] by Thierry Mugler, who came out of retirement to create the look, which took, you guys, eight months to complete, by the way. It appeared to be dripping wet, thanks in part to the crystals and shimmery material. Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx made their public debut as a couple last night. While they didn't hit the pink carpet together, the couple did pose for photos with one another inside, and Kendall and Kylie Jenner broke out the feathers for their camp looks. Kendall wore bright orange feathered Versace gown, while Kylie opted for a lilac look, with a fur stohl I'm hoping faux, and a matching wig. Actress Janelle Monae embraced wearable art, with this custom Christian Siriano look, and the eye even winked as she walked down the pink carpet. Come on now. Lady Gaga served up multiple looks for her grand entrance to the event, all created by Brandon Maxwell. It started off with a huge pink dress, that took an army of men with umbrellas to wrangle, she then stripped down to a black dress, followed by a skin tight pink dress, and then it all ended up with her posing in her underwear, here it comes. Yes girl, with huge platform shoes. Serena Williams wore this stunning neon yellow Versace gown, with pink feathery leaf accents, and she paired her look with neon Nikes. Jennifer Lopez sparkled in this beaded Versace dress, with a plunging neckline and fringe detailing. She wore a matching headpiece, and of course A-rod, I mean, Tory, makes a good accessory, am I right? 
- [Tory] Mmm bah! 
- [Sam] Okay Lupita Nyong'o embraced the rainbow, with this Versace gown, with pink star pattern and rainbow ruffles, and check out the gold afro picks in her hair, with raised fist logos, yes. Jared Leto, my favorite, had the best accessory of the night. A custom replica of his head. He brought it along while rocking this red Gucci dress. Kacey Musgraves looked like a barbie doll, in this hot pink Moschino leather dress, pairing it with a blow dryer bag and cat eye shades. Cardi B won the award for the biggest train, with this red feathered, Tom Brown gown. The 10 foot long train, nearly took over the pink carpet, and Cierra might have won best hair of the night, I think she won, let's be honest, with this very extra, gorgeous afro. She also wore a custom Peter Dundas emerald green crown, because she is a queen, and Zendaya had a fairy tale moment at the gala, transforming into Cinderella, in this Tommy Hilfiger ball gown, with white poofy sleeves, and a skirt that lit up, yes, yes, yes. 
- Sam, you drink some water, we'll talk. 
- Are you, I actually looked at Al, or Al, I looked at Jeff midway, and your eyes were closed. 
- Dude, I was out. I was thinking about cheese and crackers, and what I'm gonna do tonight. 
- You know what I was thinking? I'm like this coffee's bitter, I should think about a different kind of coffee. (laughs) 
- I guess I'm the only one, 
- I was kinda into it Sam. 
- really appreciated the looks as art. Say what you want. 
- It took, all those people got together to entertain us, 
- I agree. 
- like that's all, I mean it's just like somebody's gotta shake it up a little bit, we all can't wear khakis and polo shirts, somebody's gotta shake it up and push the envelope a little bit, that's what art does. 
- I'm for universal uniforms everyday. 
- Like Star Trek? 
- Yes! 
- Boring! 
- Boring, I wear the same thing to work everyday, that's fine with me. 
- Yeah, that's a man of a certain age, I'd do the same thing, I got those green sweat pants, they could walk to work themselves. 
- I've noticed that too. 
- Now, Tory, do you have a favorite, even though I guess you were bored by it? 
- No, no, I did have a favorite, Ezra Miller, I though absolutely nailed camp. And this is a guy that is gender fluid, and he used prosthetics as the eyes, 
- Wow! 
- And you really get that kid, 
- Wait, wait, wait, those weren't real eyes? 
- I know, I don't know what I said it like that. Those were real eyes. But it's about the artifice and the exaggeration, and I like the gender fluidity, that was all over the red carpet, 
- [Sam] It was. 
- the pink carpet, excuse me. 
- Yeah, I loved that too, I'm with you, Al? 
- I'mma nod my head and pretend like I know what artifice means. 
- [Sam] (laughs) 
- The artificialness, like it's fake, like camp is very kitschy and fake and over done. 
- [Sam] Right, now. 
- Now, what does kitschy mean? 
- [Sam] Same thing. 
- Campy, yeah. 
- [Al] Okay, thank you. 
- Now Al, we do call you Al Fashion Jackson, 
- Yes ma'am. 
- so you had to have a favorite. 
- Oh, my boy Nick Jonas. I mean that is like 
- [Sam] Your boy, huh? 
- Yeah, we go way back, but I just like, he looks like, 
- He looks like little finger. 
- He looks like a waiter at The Cheesecake Factory, doesn't he? 
- [Tory] Yeah. (laughs) 
- [Jeff] Like Dubai. 
- [Al] Yeah, like, 
- [Sam] In Dubai. 
- [Al] makes me hungry. 
- [Tory] A lot of people, yes. 
- The Dubai Cheesecake Factory. 
- That's it, that's it, 
- That's a good one. 
- that's their uniforms. 
- You nailed it, you nailed it, Jeff, do you have a favorite? 
- Well, listen, I know everyone hates Kylie and Kendall, the Kardashians, or Jenners I should say, check them out, they look terrific, but I don't like that they didn't walk with their dates down the red or the pink carpet. 
- That's a good one, that's a good one. Hey, I'm gonna, listen, I think all the work that these fashion designers put into these outfits, I really wanna give them some credit, I know 
- [Al] Sam, who was your favorite? 
- [Sam] Janelle Monae, that is a work of art. That dress is art, you guys, and then again, with the gender fluidity, I think that Jared Leto with that gorgeous red Gucci gown, and then who doesn't love a severed head as a purse. 
- I really didn't even notice he was wearing a gown, and I think that's the way, if you don't want people to notice, just carry another head. I really did not notice he was wearing a gown, till you said something. 
- [Jeff] Wait, that's a purse? 
- I believe it was a purse. 
- I think it was, or an accessory, but he held it like a purse. 
- [Sam] He held it like a purse. 
- [Tory] He sure did. 
- [Sam] I, hey, I'm all for it. 
- [Al] So we don't know. 
- [Tory] Lookin' good Jared. I don't know. 
- [Al] Now what if Mark showed up with that purse of your head? 
- [Jeff] Fashion. 
- [Sam] Yeah, exactly, fashion. All right, let's get this next story, an update to the college admission scandal. Lori Loughlin's defense might have just gotten a boost, thanks to the University of Southern California's crew team. Teams that reports this ad for the team is posted all over campus. You can see it says no experience, no problem. Some say the poster could help Lori's defense, that her daughters lack of experience doesn't matter, the team doesn't require experience to join. Lori of course, is accused of paying bribes to pass her daughters off as athletic recruits, in order to get them into USC. Now Tory, I know you are our legal eagle, this makes my blood boil. 
- [Tory] Yeah. 
- Because if Lori Loughlin is going to use this as her defense, she's suggesting that all of us are stupid. 
- [Tory] Yep. 
- She's suggesting that everybody out there that has worked hard to get into a university, whether you are an athlete, whether you are as a scholar, again is stupid, so could this work for her? 
- Yeah, it could go both ways, right? It could backfire completely, because it's so obvious. We have her on tape, being like, Take a picture of them on rowing machines, and send it in. We know the real thing. She insulted so many people when she plead not guilty. That's really where she made her mistake as we talked before. Now it only takes one person, to be like, Maybe she didn't know though. So they are using the loophole defense, it's a long shot, it's a Hail Mary, but it's worked before, and all she wants to do is avoid prison time. 
- [Jeff] And I think she is gonna do that. 
- [Tory] You do? 
- And I don't think so. 
- I think she's gonna, listen. She's not calling us stupid, our judicial system is calling us stupid, the lawyers that defend her are calling us stupid, because if she gets off, it's just proof that our system does not work. 
- [Sam] You're right. 
- And that's what's gonna happ, she's gonna walk, 
- But our. 
- because you could buy your way out of jail if you have enough money. 
- And many would argue our system works, in the opposite way, because you do have women of color that are locked up for, oh I'm sorry, sending their kid to a public school in a different zip code. So Al, does the judicial system work, or does it not work, depending on how you look at it, inside what lens? 
- I think it's working perfectly. 
- [Sam] Unfortunately. 
- It caters to the rich, I mean, if you are rich, you don't see jail as a deterrent. Like, anybody that's got some money, you can get a good attorney, Tory you know this, the reason lawyers cost different amounts of money and some are free, is a free lawyer is gonna be like, Sam, take the deal., where as a great lawyer is gonna go through everything. Did they say the, or thee when they Mirandized you? They're gonna figure out 
- Wow. 
- and all they need is one thing, and that's why you pay that money, and if you have money, you're gonna get that lawyer, and they're gonna get you off, so that's why Jeff feels like that, 'cause it's true. 
- Yeah, it's disappointing, shame on her, and shame on the judicial system, 
- Yeah. 
- We need reform, and we need reform now. DBL's live, we will bring you breaking news as soon as it happens. Coming up, Acapella never sounded so good.

- Today at four, followed by WUSA 9 news at five. 
- Welcome back to DBL, it is time for fifth host, when we talk about what you're talkin' about. A Texas bartender has been arrested, and charged for over serving a man, the night he shot and killed eight people. Lindsay Glass is accused of violating a state law by selling alcohol to an intoxicated or insane person. Police say she should have known to stop serving the man, because he appeared drunk, and armed. Turned out his blood alcohol level was more than four times the legal limit. After leaving the bar, the man killed his estranged wife, and seven others, before dying in a police shootout. The bartender now faces up to a year in prison, a fine of $500 or both. Should she be charged with a crime? Now, she wouldn't be charged for murder, this would be a misdemeanor, so to speak, I just wanna clarify that. 
- Sad story, Bobby from Facebook says, I think the bartender is responsible for keeping patrons from becoming unreasonably intoxicated, but only the shooter is responsible for murder. Bobby, great take, you used the perfect word there, unreasonably intoxicated, and with your BAC at four times the legal limit, that means that you probably can't stand up. The fact that this man was armed, at least to the point where she was aware of it, I think that she should be implicated in some way. I don't know, my whole thing, I'm not about throwing people in jail. I mean, this could be used to teach other people. I mean, you shouldn't have to teach people not to serve drunk people with guns, but some people gotta learn that lesson, I guess. 
- Yeah. 
- Yeah, Patty from Facebook says, Bars are just out to make money. They don't care about the dangers of alcohol. This needs to change. I know, Sam, you were a bartender, and you can speak. 
- [Sam] Jeff too. 
- And Jeff too, and there are very strict laws about serving people that you can reasonably see are over served. 
- Oh they make an example of that. 
- Yeah. 
- [Jeff] Oh yeah. 
- In Los Angeles, it's a corporation called the ABC, they train you, they make sure to let you know about those red flags, and God forbid you over serve someone, both Jeff and I have cut many people off, but we both seen people, 
- [Jeff] Oh yeah. 
- our colleagues, dragged out of that bar in handcuffs, to make a point, 
- [Tory] For serving. 
- because of a DUI, you could kill someone, you could kill yourself. 
- Right, they don't bring them out the back door, they make sure all the servers see it, they bring him out the front door, they make an example, like they handcuff 'em, so it is a big deal. 
- You're serving a drug, 
- And I think it should and I, Yeah 
- Tory, alcohol's a drug. 
- And I think you should be liable, if you're a gun maker and you sell to an underage person by mistake, you're liable, and they shoot people, you're also liable, so I think she broke the law. 
- And I do wanna set this up though. We've talked about this story, we set it up for a minute. We don't know if this guy was coming up to the bar, we don't know the whole, what was going on, obviously I've seen someone fall out of a chair, I know to cut them off. If they're all over the place, and they're coming to get drinks, I don't know. I'm not responsible. 
- [Sam] Yeah, are they drinking in the bathroom, 
- Right, we don't, 
- are they properly trained, 
- Did they drink before they came, so there's a lot that goes in this, we can't just speculate on what the bartender did or did not see. But Marcus from Facebook says, How would the bartender have known what this guy was going to do after he left the bar? Hold people accountable for their own actions. Marcus, I love you for saying that. Accountability, I think a word that has been erased from the dictionary. Be accountable for your own actions, not because you're fifth grade teacher gave you an F and called you a name, that's why you went and shot up everybody, not because the bartender over served you, that's why you went and shot up everybody? Hold this man accountable. Does this lady need to do her job depending on the circumstances? Maybe. This man's accountable. Not anybody else. He's the one who killed eight people, let's not forget that. 
- Got it, all right. 
- Sorry. 
- Oh, great takes everybody, thanks for writing in. Coming up on DBL, eat better, sleep better. Uh-oh, I'm already sold.

- What you just heard involved no instruments, only five voices, that's acapella band Pentatonix, and they just kicked off their first world tour. I caught up with three of the bands five members in today's chatting with the stars. Scott, Mitch, and Kevin, welcome to Daily Blast Live. Pentatonix are about to kick off a world tour, but I'd like to talk to you about your early days. You guys made your mark covering popular songs on YouTube. Is there a song or artist you have not covered yet, but you've got your sights set on? 
- We haven't really done a Taylor Swift song. We tried. 
- Yeah, we could do the new one. 
- Yeah. 
- Exactly, yeah, that'd be really, really fun. 
- You guys have kicked off your world tour, yet there are still some critics who still say you guys are just a cover band. So how do you respond to that kind of criticism? 
- I don't think it really bothers us, at the end of the day, like we take songs that we love and do them in a way that only we can do them, which is a very special ability that we've kind of created over the past years, and it's been really, really fun getting into original music, it's a journey, and we're just so thankful that we get to (mumbles) 
- I want to play a rapid fire question game with you all, I've decided I'm callin' it, the Aca-Answers with Pentatonix, so are you ready?

- Bob Hearts Abishola, CBS this fall. 
- Welcome back to DBL, making the right food choices can be tough, in today's so nutritious, sponsored by SoClean, Tory Shulman meets up with a nutritionist to learn about foods that'll help you sleep better. Take a look. 
- Hey guys, we are here with Sara Peternell, she is a holistic nutritionist, at Family Nutrition Services, and she is here to tell us, how food can affect your sleep. I know, mind blown. Talk to me about how sleep and eating go together, 'cause I never thought about that. 
- Absolutely, who hasn't had trouble sleeping, 
- Yes! 
- at one point or another, I know I have. 
- What are some specific foods, so I know to stock? 
- There are foods that are rich in an amino acid called tryptophan. The first one is-
- 
- Turkey, yeah, yeah. 
- you said it. Exactly, that's why everybody's so sleepy on Thanksgiving. 
- Right. 
- But nuts are a really good accessible source of tryptophan. Almonds, brazil nuts, walnuts, just eating a quarter cup of these per day, can really help to boost your tryptophan levels, which converts in the body to serotonin. 
- Wow, so you'd be nuts not to do it. 
- You would be totally nuts not to do (laughs). 
- Sorry. All right, so what else other than nuts? 
- So my favorite one of all is actually cherries. Cherries, when they contain melatonin, they actually just help to contribute to your bodies own production of melatonin. This sleep hormone is one of the hormones that regulates like our circadian rhythm. 
- So cherries, nuts, what else? 
- Fish, is actually a sleep remedy, 
- Really? 
- and it's not thought of, but it should be because it has a very high level of vitamin B6. 
- And B6 helps you sleep? 
- Vitamin B6 is actually important for that conversion of tryptophan to serotonin. 
- Oh, I see. 
- So when we're talking about nuts, you know, we use the amino acid in our bodies to convert to serotonin, but if you're low in B6, that conversion doesn't take place quite as naturally. 
- I want to thank Sarah Peternell for dealing with me first off, and for teaching us some accessible things you can do right now, at the grocery store, to help your own body naturally get to some Z's. 
- I guess I need to stock up on cherries, 'cause momma hasn't been sleepin'. 
- You've been having some trouble, and she also mentioned to me yogurt. So if you make a smoothie and include all of this, yogurt, cherries, walnuts, you can sort of make a sleepy time smoothie.
