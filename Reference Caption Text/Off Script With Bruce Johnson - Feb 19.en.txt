- Track the winter weather with me and search for the WUSA9 app in your app store. 
- We're gonna time out hour by hour when the snow moves in and we'll time out hour by hour when it turns to sleet and freezing rain. 
- This is just a terrible tragedy. I mean, children are so scarred by this crime. 
- Do you think Bryce Harper's coming back? 
- You know, part of me says no and a part of me says yes. 
- Hello, I'm Bruce Johnson, thanks for joining us. Welcome to OffScript. Got lots to talk about. I sat down with noted scholar and Jesuit priest, Father Thomas Reese earlier today for an important conversation about sexual abuse in the Catholic Church. That interview coming up but first we need to bring you up to date on the weather. A red weather alert, here's Topper Shutt. 
- Yeah and I want to emphasize, we have trimmed the snowfall totals a little bit. That doesn't diminish the impact of the storm. It's sort of like focusing of the hurricane, just on winds, it has other elements that are dangerous and this certainly does to with sleet and freezing rain. Three to five inches, plus. Gattersburg, Frederick, Leesburg, Martinsburg, up towards Hagerstown, into the mountains. One to three in the immediate metro area, including D.C. Chevy Chase, Buoy, Bethesda, down to the south, southern Maryland, not as much. You were never gonna have that much anyway. A trace to an inch, your cold air is just simply lacking a little bit. So what does that mean? Well, it still means that the roads are gonna be a disaster as we get into Wednesday morning. RPM up to it's old tricks again, going seven inches. Everybody else has a grasp on reality around two inches to three inches. Which is where we settled on in the metro area. So what do we know? Well we know that snowfall will be moderate to heavy six a.m. to noon, and the roads will become very treacherous. And when it starts it's gonna pick up in intensity quickly and it's going to accumulate very quickly. The snow will go to a mix north and west in the afternoon. And it will go to rain D.C., south and east in the afternoon. And if we can get through the day it'll turn to all rain tomorrow night. After some morning showers on Thursday we pop back in the 50's. Look how much moisture is headed our way. If this system were about 300 miles off to the east we'd be looking at another, a little blizzard. But we're not so, five o'clock in the morning. Little bit of snow breaking out in part of the metro area. Temps, upper 20's, low 30's becomes pretty much heavy to moderate across the entire metro area. This is by seven o'clock on Wednesday. The temps are still 29, 30 degrees. By the time we get to ten o'clock we still have heavy snow across the metro area. And then it begins to mix and change right around the lunch hour. We will come back. We will talk about how much ice could accumulate behind the snow and who we think are most likely for power outages. 
- Okay, let's talk some baseball here. Manny Machado is getting 300 million. What will Bryce Harper get? Reports tonight say Machado has agreed to sign with San Diego Padres. Contract reportedly worth $300 million over ten years. The deal is reported to be pending the results of a physical. The former Baltimore Oriole's and LA Dodgers infielder is slated to play third base for the Padre's. Now, the attention turns to Bryce Harper. Speculation about where he'll end up is all over social media tonight. Will he resign with the Nationals? Most of us don't think so. The latest rumors have him going to Philadelphia. The Nats player's already in spring training camp down in Florida. Darrin Haynes sat down with Nats manager Dave Martinez to talk about Bryce. 
- How much do you want Bryce on your team? 
- You know what, Bryce and I have a special relationship. I mean, everybody knows that. Who wouldn't want Bryce Harper on their team? Honestly, I mean, he's one of the best young players in the game, you know. And you know for me it's all about what he wants now. You know, for his family and his career, it really is. So, I mean, he's got big decisions to make. You know, but I'd be be wrong to say that, of course you know, anybody would want him on his team. He makes a big difference. 
- If Bryce decided hey, you know what, I'm coming back to the Nationals. What would be your reaction when he walks in the door? 
- Hey, I'd be like hey, welcome back, you know. 
- That's it, that's it huh. 
- Time to work, you know. Let's go to work, you know . 
- Do you think Bryce Harper's coming back? 
- You know part of me says no and a part of me says yes. You know, you just, the way this game is you just don't, you really don't know. 
- Which way are you leaning towards? 
- I you know what, I honestly I, like I said, I can't, I can't lean either way. It's so weird because of, you know. You know like I said, you know, and I try to, you know I try like say hey, you know what, this is what I gotta do today you know. I gotta lead 59 guys tomorrow morning. Get up at six o'clock, get to that ballpark and get the day going you know. My focus is on the day at hand and the here and now and that's kind of what I worry about. 
- Eat your food man. 
- Thanks Darrin. Is Martinez playing us? How does he not know? Joining me to discuss all this column is Mike Wise. How does he not know what Bryce is gonna do? 
- I think, I don't know if he does because I think there's this big question mark here. Manny Machado just signed for the largest free agent deal in the history of American sports, not just baseball. And there's a big pressure on Scott Boras, who is Bryce's agent to go at least one dollar over that. The Nationals have already offered 300 million. I don't know if that offer is even there any more for ten years. So this is, I think what Dave Martinez is thinking is, has Ted Lerner broke his dependency with Scott Boras whom he's got all this, he had a bunch of his clients before. Can he say no to Scott Boras this time. And I think that's gonna be the question. Personally, I kind of want Bryce to stay. I really do, I think he's Q-Rating in town. He's star power. 
- We like stars. I mean he puts people in the seats-
- 
- We do like stars. 
- He puts jerseys on the kids' backs. That sort of thing. But what do you think? Whatcha got? 
- My gut is that the Phillies are gonna offer something so enormous. One person said nine years, 367 million. I don't know if that's gonna happen or not. I do know that the Nationals will be given a chance to counter. I can't see them going over 350 million, I just can't. You know, just based on their payroll, just based on what they've got committed already. But I don't know, you know, I don't know. That could be a wild card. 
- What you haven't mentioned, the Nats already have a team. They have somebody in Bryce's position right now. Does that matter? 
- They have Robles, they got Juan Soto, those are guys that are gonna definitely take his spot at the plate. They're not gonna be Bryce Harper. Bryce Harper was a live wire. He was like a hand grenade. He was a, you didn't know when he was gonna explode. 
- And we don't need to see him. 
- And he was the most exciting thing in sports in Washington for a while. 
- And we don't nee to see him in a Phillies uniform. They already bring thousands of fans down here every time they play the Nats. 
- Philly fans are the worst. 
- Ha! 
- And I love you Selika. I know you, I work with you, Philly fans are the worst. 
- All right, okay, she works here. All right, Mike Wise, thanks a lot man, appreciate it. 
- All right. 
- Okay, flip the page. Sexual abuse scandals have shaken the Catholic Church at its core. For us it starts here in Washington D.C. where former cardinal and Archbishop Theodore McCarrick has been defrocked by the Pope. He is now only Mr. McCarrick and living in a remote monastery somewhere out there in the Midwest. To Argentina, where the New York Times is reporting, deaf children were sexually abused for years by the priests who should have been caring for them. You probably now that Pope Francis this week will begin a summit of bishops and cardinals who have been called to Rome to fix this. But can they, will they? Today I talk with Father Thomas Reese. He's a noted Jesuit priest and scholar who is on his way to Rome. Father Reese first off tell me why you're going to Rome right now. 
- I'm going to Rome because the Pope has called a meeting of the top bishops from around the world to come and talk to him about the sex abuse crisis. He wants to emphasis to them how important it is to protect children and their responsibility to do that. And I think he's gonna make the point that if they don't, if they're not responsible he's going to hold them accountable. So this is gonna be an important meeting for the Catholic Church because it's the first meeting like this that's ever happened. 
- Yeah, let's talk about some of the headlines. I mean, just today, the Washington Post is reporting that deaf children were sexually abused by priests in Argentina. What do you make of this? Is this gonna come up in Rome? 
- This is, I mean this is just a terrible tragedy. I mean, children are so scarred by this crime. This abuse that they suffer under. And that's why the church has to have a policy to deal with it. You know, in the United States we've had a zero policy on abuse of children. And in fact in the church we've had this policy of zero tolerance. So that anybody, any priest involved in abuse is removed from the priesthood and could never act as a priest again. Now the second part is to make sure that all the bishops implement this policy. Make it happen and that's gonna be an important message at this meeting. 
- Father Reese talk to me about the apparent hypocrisy in all of this. It's come out today in a New York Times article that the Vatican has a book, has rules on what to do with children who are fathered by priests. Who knew? 
- Well I think that the, actually when you look at the document from the reports that I've seen, the emphasis in the document is on the priests responsibility for his child. Pope Francis has said this in the past. He said that even before he became Pope. And that is that if a priest fathers a child then he has a responsibility as a father. Not, you know, financial responsibility and also just as a father. As a paternal responsibility and that that responsibility supersedes his responsibility to be a priest. And he needs to leave the priesthood and raise that child.

- Welcome back to OffScript. The Pope has summoned church leaders from around the world to meet at the Vatican as the church is now in crisis. Will they address the issue of gay priests? Let's continue the conversation with noted Jesuit priest and scholar Father Thomas Reese. It's a Skype interview and this part of the connection wasn't as clear but we think it's that important. What about the whole issue of gay priests? I was in the seminary a hundred years ago, there were 13 guys in my class. Only one went the entire 13 years and became a priest and I know that John was gay, okay. We've known all along that there are gay priests. If it were up to a lot of Catholics there would be openly gay priests. There would be women priests. There would be married priests who could then have children. When is the Church gonna come to this or is this just wishful thinking? 
- The first important thing to say is that there are a lot of wonderful gay priests in the priesthood. Priests who, gay priests who observe their vow of celibacy and are very good pastoral priests. We don't wanna mix up the issue of gay priests with the issue of sexual abuse of minors. And I, you know, that needs to, that point needs to be made. But I agree with you. I think we need more honesty in the church. For example, the US bishops have never allowed anybody to survey priests to find out, you know, what percentage of them are gay. We've got estimated from I mean, all over the place. And nobody's got any real data. The one fact we do know is that there are gay priests there and most of them, you know, are good priests who observe their promise of celibacy and are good for the church. 
- Do you expect anything to come of this meeting or is this just gonna be more window dressing? 
- [Thomas] I think that most Americans are gonna be disappointed with this meeting. Because we would like to see policies and procedures set up and structures to hold bishops accountable. I think the truth of the matter is that this meeting is primarily for other countries where bishops are in total denial. They don't think they have this problem. They think this is an American problem. And basically the message we want to take to these bishops is, don't make the same mistakes that the American bishops made. You know, get your act together now. Remove these bad crazies and reach out and help the victims in healing. 
- But Father Reese it's not just the priests, we're seeing Theodore McCarrick, right here in Washington. Who has become the poster child for this kind of abuse. So it's not just the priests, the bishops are being asked to police themselves. Are they not? 
- No, I think that you know, this is very important and needs to be dealt with. McCarrick because he was a retired bishop, you know, they brought the information to the Vatican and the Vatican said, okay treat him just like you would a priest of the archdiocese of New York. So his case was investigated. They hired a forensic research team. The information was presented to the lay review board and they said the accusations were credible and substantiated and he was removed from, you know, he was removed. And he had to resign his being a cardinal and now he's been removed from the priesthood. He's not, now he can no longer be Father McCarrick or Bishop McCarrick, he is Mr McCarrick. 
- [Bruce] Yeah. 
- He can never act as a priest again. 
- [Bruce] Yeah. 
- This is exactly what should happen. 
- Father Reese good luck on your trip. Look forward to your reporting. 
- Thank you, good to be with you. 
- And Washington's current Archbishop Donald is obviously leaving. We don't have any word tonight on who will succeed him.

- Track the winter weather with me and search the WUSA9 app in your app store. Alright, we're looking at a red weather alert for the snow, for the sleet and also for the freezing rain. All right here is a look at our snowfall maps. Three to five Leesburg, Gaithersburg, Frederick, points north and west. In the metro, one to three. These are a little lower than yesterday. Yes, because we're thinking more sleet and less snow and then to Southern Maryland, y'all never had that much coming anyway, trace to an inch there. Notice there's a plus sign out here. Some of you folks in that band could get conceivably over five inches of snow, which is gonna be a problem as it kicks to rain. So we're kinda worried about that. We'll get back to this in a second. Look, but we look forward to 66 on Sunday. We gotta get through some things to get there. So here we some. All right, GFS, European model. Pretty much in agreement with us around three inches downtown. That seems reasonable, look at the moisture. This is crazy. I mean for Wichita, Kansas, all the way to Cape Hatteras, it was snow extending up into Iowa and also South Dakota and Nebraska. That's a big storm. So on the broad-o-meter I do kind of reserve these for pure snows but because this is gonna be a legitimate snow with some sleet and freezing rain and enough snow on the front end too. That'd be plowable and sledable. In terms of the impact, well, we know it's coming so hopefully folks will just stay off the road but nonetheless still we're gonna give it a 3.5 in the impact-o-meter as well. So it's certainly a legitimate storm. Now I have updated this, this is on our website. I just tweeted this out. In terms of power outages and here's why I did this. Isolated along I-95 and points west, unlikely east and then scattered out in Cumberland, Romney and Hagerstown where we think significant icing will occur. But here's the deal, either where icing won't occur if we get three inches of snow in DC, plain old fashioned rain will add to the weight of that snow and could bring down limbs as well. So we may see power outages, not just confined to those areas that pick up ice. Alright, this is one model, most of the ice far to the west and not that bad, Petersburg three tenths and about two tenths in Romney. We can probably handle that. This is gonna be tough. This is now almost an inch of ice outdoor Cumberland, three tenths Leesburg, three tenths Gaithersburg that would cause some power outages no doubt. Why is it not a pure snow? Well we start out with the pure snow 'cause this column of air is all below freezing. But then we get warm air as it moves into the middle layers of the atmosphere either becomes sleet which is the bouncy pieces of ice but freezing rain is what we're most concerned about, falls liquid and then just freezes on contact. So this hasn't changed too much from yesterday. We adjusted the time a bit. Heavier snows 6 a.m. to noon. Roads will become dangerous. It will start quickly, become intense quickly and accumulate quickly. It will go to a mixed north and west in the afternoon. It will go to rain DC, south and east in the afternoon. And heavy rain possible overnight and then showers then we're in the 50's on Thursday. How about that? So 6 a.m. tomorrow, there's a snow across most of the metro area. Notice the shades of blue, the darker the blue, heavier snow. Pretty much thumping at nine o'clock, no doubt but that begins to turn as we get toward the lunch hour, especially down to the south and then just plain old rain DC, south and east by about three o'clock. Some lingering freezing rain north and west until the evening, so here we go. Red alert on Wednesday, 56, morning showers Thursday and then nice on Friday, 54. In terms of the snow once again, we're looking again three to five north and west and one to three in the metro and about trace to an inch south and east. Bruce will be back after this.
