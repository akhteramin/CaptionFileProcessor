- (sighs) um, to be standing here representing um, one of the greatest artists of our time, James Baldwin, is-
- It's a little surreal. James Baldwin birthed this baby and Barry (crying) you nurtured her, you surrounded her with so much love and support so it's appropriate for me to be standing here cause I'm an example of what it looks like when support and love is poured into someone. (sighs) Mom, I love you so much. Thank you for teaching me that god is always leaning, always has been leaning in my direction. Gamosis, they'll ask me about that later. (laughing) So many people to thank, Chelsea Barnard, who brought this project to Anna Perna, Megan Ellinson, Anna Perna, plan B, this amazing cast. My sisters in art, Marina, Amy, Emma, Rachel, it has been an honor to have my name be just said with yours this whole step of the way has been pretty amazing. The Rivers family, Kiki, Coleman, Tiana, Stephan. (sighs) God is good all the time. 
- [Announcer] Please welcome Jason Mamoa and Academy Award winning actress, Helen Miran. 
- Well you know, honestly, I swear to god that Jason and I didn't coordinate our outfits tonight. This was purely accidental, but you know, it just goes to show, doesn't it, that these days, a Hawaiian god and a very mature English woman can actually wear the same color. We can both wear pink. (laughing) 
- Finally, times are changing. 
- [Helen] Yeah. 
- Boom.

- [Man] Your film will speak to many with a singular voice. Ask yourself what you have to say and then say it in ways that are unique to you. 
- [Woman] Use your gifts to reach beyond your wildest imagination. Say what you believe. Your voice matters. 
- [Man] Pick up a camera and get going.

- [Man] Whiskey Cavalier, special sneak preview after the Oscars. Series premiere, Wednesday 10/9 central on ABC. 
- [Announcer] The Oscars on ABC brought to you by, Google. From Rage Against the Machine, here's Tom Morello. 
- Movies, like music, can do more than entertain. A great movie can become a part of the conversation of history and like our next movie, and the kind of songs I like to make, it can do it with feedback, noise and yes, anger. Adam McKay's, Vice, is such a film. Shredding the traditional biopic structure with passion and humor, Vice seeks to put a spotlight on a man who avoided it his whole career, Dick Chaney. Brilliantly acted, the film is a lesson about the past that serves as a warning about the present and the future. War, greed, truth, lies, fatherhood, love, torture and betrayal all swirl around in Vice with a hard backbeat and a killer baseline. Some will dig it, some will cover their ears, but everyone will do the one thing the movie begs us to do, react. This is Vice. 
- [Man] So what's the plan? 
- The plan is to take over the damn place. 
- George, you're a kinetic leader. You make decisions based on instinct. 
- People always said that. 
- I know what I'm gonna show the world, true raw power, of the American presidency. 
- That's not something the vice president really does. 
- Oh, it is now. 
- You need to remember that if you have power, people will always try to take it from you. 
- [Announcer] Please welcome Elsie Fisher and Stephan James. 
- It doesn't take a magic wand to transform an actor into a character whose look is memorable and meaningful to the story. 
- All it takes are this year's nominees for achievement in makeup and hair styling. Border, Goran Lundstrom and Pamela Goldammer. Mary Queen of Scots, Jenny Shircore, Marc Pilcher, and Jessica Brooks. Vice, Greg Cannom, Kate Biscoe and Patricia Dehaney. 
- And the Oscar goes to Greg Cannom, Kate Biscoe and Patricia Dehaney for Vice. 
- [Announcer] This is the first Oscar and nomination for Kate Biscoe and Patricia Dehaney, the forth Oscar and 10th nomination for Greg Cannom. Oscars in this category have been awarded since 1981. 
- Thank you Adam Herna, our great director, Adam McKay, Christian Bale, what a, oh you're here. (laughing) Go ahead.

- [Announcer] Please welcome Brian Tyree Henry and a nominee tonight for actress in a leading role, Melissa McCarthy. 
- A rakish tilt to a hat, the drape of fabric just so, nuance and sophistication are just two qualities-
- of the most effective costume design. 
- These artists create a pettish of textiles with authenticity, yet never distract from the story. Costume designers construct the looks that ground a character to a particular time and place in the subtlest, subtlest of ways. 
- [Brian] So true. So true. 
- So true. So true. 
- Here are the nominees for achievement in costume design. The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, costume design by Mary Zophres. Black Panther, costume design by Ruth Carter. The Favorite, costume design by Sandy Powell. Mary Poppins Returns, costume design by Sandy Powell. Mary Queen of Scots, costume design by Alexandra Byrne. 
- And the Oscar goes to, can't get it. 
- Here, yeah, okay. 
- Get it, okay. Black Panther, Ruth Carter. 
- [Announcer] This is the first Oscar and third nomination for Ruth Carter. She was previously nominated in this category for Malcolm X and Amistaad. 
- Wow, wow, I got it. Wow, this has been a long time coming. Spike Lee, thank you for my start. I hope this makes you proud. Woo. Marvel may have created the first black superhero, but through costume design, we turned him into an African king. It's been my life's honor to create costumes. Thank you to the Academy. Thank you for honoring African royalty and the empowered way women can look and lead on screen. Thank you to my crews around the world who helped bring Waconda to life, our genius director, Ryan Cugler. You are a guiding force. Thank you for your trust and understanding my role in telling the African American story. Adding vibranium to costumes is very expensive so thank you, Victoria, Alonzo, Kevin Fahee, Luis Esparzido, Jeffrey Chernov, Bob Eiger and Nate Moore. My career is built with passion to tell stories that allow us to know ourselves better. This is for my 97 year old mother watching in Massachusets.

- I know, crispy bacon is the best thing to ever happen to the fries. 
- (laughs) What? It's a fry show, McDonald's world famous fries, featuring bacon. 
- Or it is the crispy bacon giving the fries some street cred with a whole new audience. 
- I'm gonna let bacon think that. 
- What was that? I couldn't hear you over the bacon ovation. [Music] Bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon [Music] 
- [Man] McDonald's classics with bacon, only for a limited time. Is it the best thing to happen to our classics? Order bacon, try for yourself and decide. 
- [Man] To you, a filmmaker of a future generation, you and I, we're already speaking to each other from across time and I thought I'd share this thought with you, if you're burning to tell this story, if you're seeing images and passages in your mind's eye, you have to make your movie. You keep up your end of the conversation and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you soon. Yours, Marty Scorsese.

- [Man] Have you heard the legend of old McClenden who battled the bulls on the bank single handed? Rose like the tides to defile Poseidon, evading the waves as they raged from his trident. McClenden braved roadways where most men won't wander to rescue the runaways from the headmasters monster. I sure would have loved to see her that fine hour, perhaps catch a glimpse of the source of her power. Make every day legendary.

So an honor to be a part of that. I want to thank the Academy, thank you so much, Ryan Kugler. I stand here stronger than I was yesterday. I stand here with agency and self-worth because of Ryan Kugler who not only made me a better designer, a better story teller, a better person.

- Community, we often use that word to describe who we are and what connects all of us involved in the different elements that bring a film from an idea in the writer's mind to it's premier on the big screen. Each person, each craft, each discipline is essential to that process. Deep down, we know that. We always have and in the end, this truly collaborative community comes together on a night like this to celebrate this past year and to look forward to the next.

Khalisi has nothing on her. Justice Ginsberg, if you'd ever like to borrow the dragons, ring me. Although the song's subject is soft spoken, its singer is a vocal powerhouse, presenting its message with the passion it deserves, and now performing I'll Fight by song writer, Diane Warren, please welcome Academy Award winner, Jennifer Hudson.

- When was the first time you hit Jessica? 
- I didn't hit her, man. Listen, I came in here to help you guys out-
- 
- Just hiding the beatings til you knew she was leaving, what? 
- You got a hearing problem? I told you I didn't hit her. Listen, where is all this coming from? I came in here of my own volition. 
- Was she cheating on you? 
- Piss off. 
- Dammit. 
- Are you back there? Are you? You'll never not get me, Maya. I'm an innocent man. 
- [Announcer] Please welcome Oscar nominated actress, Queen Latifa. 
- It is an honor to be here to introduce one of tonight's nominees for best picture, The Favorite. The film takes us to 18th century Britain with a monarch lacking the interest and maybe the ability to lead. Decision making is taken over by an inner circle that's infighting for the ruler's affection. As the stakes get higher, we see corruption lead to the downfall of one underling after another. It's not easy being queen. This is The Favorite. 
- I hope you haven't found your time with the queen too tedious. 
- She seems quite lovely. 
- [Woman] The queen is an extraordinary person. 
- [Woman] You're so beautiful. If I were a man, I would ravish you. 
- And stand up the other way. 
- You're jealous. 
- [Woman] She is a viper. 
- I am on my side, always. 
- Stop it. Stop! 
- [Woman] Oh it is fun to be queen sometimes. 
- [Woman] Do you actually think you have won? 
- Why would I? 
- Take your shot. 
- [Announcer] Please welcome Academy Award nominated actress, Angela Basset and Academy Award winning actor, Javier Bardem. 
- Members of the movie academy come from across the globe so it is truly fitting that this year, foreign language films are not just recognized in this category, but in almost every category. 
- Exactly. 
- Here are the nominees for best foreign language film. From Lebanon, Capernaum, directed by Nadine Labaki. From Poland, Cold War, directed by Pawel Pawlikowski. From Germany, Never Look Away, directed by Forian Henckel von Donnersmarch. From Mexico, Roma, directed by Alfonso Cuaron. From Japan, Shoplifters, directed by Hirokazu Kore-Eda. 
- And the Oscar goes to, 
- [Together] Roma. 
- [Announcer] This is the ninth movie from Mexico to be nominated and the first to win the Oscar for foreign language film. 
- Thank you. Am I going to get some (inaudible) as well? Well, thank you, Yaliza. Thank you Marina. Thank you Gabriela, Nico, all the cast and crew. I grew up watching foreign language films and learning so much from them and being inspired, films like Citizen Kane, Jaws, Rashamon, The Godfather and Breathless. When asked about the new wave, Claude Sharolt said, there are no waves, there's only the ocean and I think that the nominees tonight have proven that we are part of the same ocean. I want to thank my family, Mexico, for being the beach where this film comes from and also to Ormo, Boo and Hernanz to be the current that pushes my drift. Thank you so much. 
- [Announcer] And now, dropping into the Oscars from above, please welcome Keegan Michael Keene. 
- Thank you. This thing. This evening's next nominee for best original song was written by Mark Shaman and Scott Whitman for the film Mary Poppins Returns. In addition to lifting the Bank's children's spirits through a series of magical adventures, Mary Poppins offers comfort and compassion with this tender lullaby, underscoring the notion that a loved one who is lost can still be very much present. Performing the Place Where Lost Things Go with Mark Shaman on piano, please welcome the divine, Miss. M. [Music] Do you ever lie awake at night [Music] [Music] Just between the dark and the morning light [Music] [Music] Searching for the things you used to know [Music] [Music] Looking for the place where the lost things go [Music] [Music] Do you ever dream or reminisce.

- [Man] To a future filmmaker, your film will speak to many with a singular voice. Ask yourself what you have to say, and then say it in ways that are unique to you. Recognize when lightening strikes even if it's not what you planned. Always stay humble before the craft. And the most important thing, pick up a camera and get going. Now you're a filmmaker. Jim Cameron. 
- [Man] Hey, we need the copper two in now. 
- Allen, is that you? 
- [Allen] You know who it is. 
- Oh, 
- [Allen] What? 
- Allen, 
- [Allen] Yeah. 
- Reception's (hissing) 
- [Allen] That's a noise you're making with your mouth. 
- You need to enunciate, I can't hear you. 
- [Allen] I know you can hear me. You owe me. 
- [Woman] With XT4 technology, make your escape, whatever it takes. Rise above with XT4 and the uncompromising Cadillac SUV's. 
- [Radio] Hey, we need an assist.

This is beyond Wi-Fi, this is X-Fi, simple, easy, awesome. Xfinity, the future of awesome. 
- [Man] It's a deadly blind spot right under your nose, tonight after the Oscars. 
- [Announcer] Please welcome Trevor Noah. 
- Black Panther may be an African hero, but his story and his appeal are universal. I know this personally because of all the people who constantly come up to me and say, Waconda forever. Everywhere in the world, my African friends are like, Waconda forever. In France, I've had people say, Hello Trevor Noah, you say Waconda forever, no? Even backstage, Mel Gibson came up to me like, Waconda forever. He said another word after that, but the Waconda part was nice. Growing up as a young boy in Waconda, I would see King Techalla flying over our village and he would remind me of a great Cossa phrase, which means, in times like these, we are stronger when we fight together than when we try to fight apart. This is best picture nominee, Black Panther. 
- [Man] I know that we have the right king, (inaudible). 
- You're a good man with a good heart and it's hard for a good man to be king. 
- The black panther lives. 
- [Woman] You get to decide what kind of king you are going to be. 
- Waconda forever! 
- [Group] Waconda forever! 
- [Announcer] Please welcome Oscar nominated actor, Michael Keaton. 
- If you think of shooting a movie and making a movie as the same thing, you've overlooked one of the most important elements of film making, the editing. Editors infuse a film with rhythm, they build suspense and they create moments that otherwise would not have existed and as an actor, they can make things like your performance a whole lot better, trust me. And here are the nominees for achievement in film editing. Black Klansman, Barry Alexander Brown. Bohemian Rhapsody, John Ottman. The Favorite, Yorgos Mavropsaridis. Green Book, Patrick J. Don Vito. Vice, Hank Corwin. And the Oscar goes to, Bohemian Rhapsody, John Ottman. 
- [Announcer] This is the first Oscar and nomination for John Ottman. 
- He just asked if I would like this and I said, sure, my mom would like it, who is here. Over there, she's 85 years old. Wow, you get up here and you completely blank. This film, I always like to say, the entire cast and crew like to always say, was a labor of love and I think Freddie Mercury, in a way, kind of brought us all together from wherever he is and, just like he did his audience and I just am so thankful for everyone bonding together and supporting each other and trusting me and I want to, there's too many people to thank of course. I'm looking at Rami (mumbles) right looking at me, better thank me. (laughs) Got the band over here, thank you so much, Brian May and Roger Taylor and not to mention, of course, Graham King and Dennis O'Sullivan, two of the hardest working and committed producers I've ever worked with my life and lastly, this goes to my parents on their fireplace mantle because they encouraged me to do whatever I wanted to do when I was a kid whether it was writing music, which was a mystery to them or making films in their garage on Nominator Way in San Jose, California. So as Freddie's father would say, good thoughts, good words, good deeds, thank you. 
- [Announcer] Please welcome, Daniel Craig and Academy Award winner, Charlise Theron. 
- As actors, we show up, we work hard and hopefully we take our job seriously without taking ourselves too seriously. (clears throat) And seriously, Charlise Theron can kick my ass. We aspire to transform ourselves into the characters we play and to transport the movie goer in the process. 
- Among a sea of brilliant performances each year, certain of them stand out for their artistry, their honesty, and the masterful choices made in interpreting their role. We honor those individuals tonight. 
- Here are the nominees for performance by an actor in a supporting role. Mahershala Ali, Green Book. 
- I just put the Attorney General of the United States in an incredibly awkward position. 
- So what, that's what the guy gets paid for. What else does he got to do? 
- That man and his brother are trying to change this country. That's what else he got to do. Now he thinks I'm some kind of, calling from some backwoods swamp jail asking to attenuate assault charges, who does that? Garbage, that's who. 
- [Daniel] Adam Driver, Black Klansman. 
- I'm Jewish, yes, but I wasn't raised to be. It wasn't part of my life, I never thought much about being Jewish, nobody around me was Jewish. You know, I wasn't going to a bunch of bar mitzvahs. I didn't have a bar mitzvah. I was just another white kid and now I'm in some basement, denying out loud. 
- [Daniel] Sam Elliott, A Star Is Born. 
- It ain't your fault. It just isn't. You know whose fault it was? Jack. That's it. No one else. 
- [Daniel] Richard E. Grant, Can You Ever Forgive Me? 
- She not here anymore, she died. 
- She did? That's young. 
- Maybe she didn't die, maybe she just moved back to the suburbs. I always confuse those two. That's right, she got married and had twins. 
- Better to have died. 
- Indeed. 
- [Daniel] Sam Rockwell, Vice. 
- You're one of the most experience guys around, you and I. Jump on board and be my vice? 
- I'm honored. 
- Don't be honored, say yes, Mr. Brass Tacks. 
- I'll have to say uh, no. 
- Dick, come on, we'll have a lot of fun. What are you doing right now? You in the private sector? 
- [Dick] Yeah. 
- Come on, I know you love politics. 
- No George. 
- Let's go. 
- [Dick] Not gonna happen. 
- Come on now. (chuckling) 
- And the Oscar goes to, Mahershala Ali. 
- [Announcer] This is the second Oscar and second nomination for Mahershala Ali. He took home his first Oscar in this category for Moonlight. 
- Academy, thank you. I want to thank Dr. Shirley for just trying to capture his essence. Trying to capture Dr. Shirley's essence pushed me to my, my ends and um, which is a reflection of the person he was and the life that he lived and I thank him. I thank my partner, Vigo, extraordinary working with you. Peter Fairly, I thank you for your leadership and your guidance and for also giving us space, like really giving us space to work it out and coming in and tweaking and really appreciate it, love you. Octavia Spencer. Chris Bowers, my double. I want to dedicate this to my grandmother who has been in my ear my entire life, telling me that, if at first I don't succeed, try, try again, that I could do anything I put my mind to, always, always pushing me to think positively and I know that I would not be here without her, that she has got me over the hump every step of the way. I thank my wife and my daughter, Barrie. I thank Universal, Participant, Amblin, everyone who contributed and helped with our movie. Again, thank you so much, appreciate it. 
- [Announcer] Coming up next, the award for animated feature. Then later, a look at Bohemian Rhapsody and Roma and a performance of Shallow from A Star Is Born. Last year, movies took us across the globe from the magic of Singapore to the mysteries of Africa, enchanting us with the joy of travel.

- Growing up in Los Angeles, can you believe it was only a dream that there would ever be a place where people could go to immerse themselves in the passion and magic of movies? Even as a child of actors, there was nothing, trust me, but guess what? The dream is happening. When we enter the new Academy Museum of Motion Pictures, we will open a door and walk into the technicolor land of Oz. We will travel through the animated world of Miazaki, perhaps encounter the shark from Jaws, and see the ruby red slippers. The dream is a reality, not just for the child in me, but for all of us from all around the world, coming soon. 
- [Announcer] Please welcome, Michelle Yo and Oscar nominated composer and producer, Ferrell Williams. 
- The Bible says, when I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child and when I became a man, I put away childish things. 
- When we move through adulthood, we look back fondly on those simpler times, the creativity we exhibited, our fearlessness, how we approached new things with wonder.

- The Ballad of Buster Scrugs brought new life into westerns with its mix of satire, sentiment, realism and romance. All of these qualities are on display in this haunting song. It's fresh, but yet you feel like you've heard it your whole life. It could have been an absurd and comical moment in the film, but the song elevates it into something authentic and beautiful. Here are the wonderful Gillian Welch and David Rollings with their Oscar nominated song, When a Cowboy Trades His Spurs For Wings.

- That's what you said? 
- Yeah, I was, no, I was like, hey Spike. (chuckles) 
- That's great. Do you know who I saw, do you know who I saw and I legit freaked out?

I share this award with the Feminist Majority Foundation, with Helen, Claire, Avery, Ruby, Sophie, Charlotte, Carly, the entire Pad Project team, with the Oakwood School, I share this.

- [Woman] In November, the Academy held the Governors Awards where honorary Oscars were presented to actress Sisily Tyson, composer, Lalo Chifren and publicist, Marvin Levee. The Thalberg Award went to producers, Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall. Kennedy is the first woman to receive the Thalberg. And on February 9th, David Oyelo hosted the Academy's annual Sci Tech Awards. Nine scientific and technical achievements represented by 27 individual award recipients were honored that night. And now, please welcome two time Academy Award winner, Barbara Streisand. 
- Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. When I first saw Black Klansman, I was stunned. I was very excited and I was very moved. It had everything a great film should have. It was so real, so funny and yet so horrifying because it was based on the truth and truth is especially precious these days. I had to-
- Thank you, thank you. So I had to tweet about it, you know, about how good it was and then I got a lovely thank you from Spike, himself and the conversation after that, was very easy because we were both raised in Brooklyn. 
- Oh oh! 
- And Spike, we both love hats. So, after a lifetime of bold game changing work, here is Spike Lee's masterpiece, the story of the first African American detective in the Colorado Springs Police Department who joins forces with his Jewish colleague to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan. Now that is funny already. But, it's an unflinching look at race relations in America. Back in the 1970's, that was then, but it is just as relevant today. 
- This is Ron Stalworth, I'm anxious to meet you. 
- [Man] I'm just happy to be talking with a true white American. 
- They want you to join the Klan? 
- They want to meet me first.

- [Man] White power!

- [Man] White power! 
- [Group] White power!

- It's our business. [Music] I believe, I believe I'm falling in love [Music]

- Yeah, I was stationed in Germany in the Army. I can pick up a little bit of what you're saying there. Watch out for them crabs. They're all snakes. Kenny should have bombed them when he had the chance. 
- And the Oscar goes to-
- 
- [Together] Rami Malek. 
- [Announcer] This is the first Oscar and nomination for Rami Malek. 
- Oh, I, I, oh my god. My mom is in here somewhere. Oh, I love you. I love you, lady. My family, thank you for all of this. You know, my dad didn't get to see me do any of this. But I think he's looking down on me right now. So uh, this is, this is a monumental moment, one I'm so appreciative to all of you, to everyone who has had a hand in getting me here. To the Academy, to people who took a chance on me, every step of the way. Graham King, Dennis O'Sullivan, everyone at Fox and New Regency, thank you guys so much. I may not have been the obvious choice, but I guess it worked out. Thank you, Queen, thank you guys for being, for allowing me to be the tiniest part of your phenomenal, extraordinary legacy. I am forever in your debt. My crew and my cast, I love you. You are my equals, you are my betters. I could have never been here without you. I think about what it would have been like to tell little bubba Rami that one day this might happen to him and I think his curly haired little mind would be blown. That kid, he was struggling with his identity, trying to figure himself out and I think to anyone struggling with theirs and trying to discover their voice, listen, we made a film about a gay man, an immigrant who lived his life just unapologetically himself and the fact that I'm celebrating him and this story with you tonight is proof that we're longing for stories like this. I am the son of immigrants from Egypt. I'm a first generation American and-
- part of my story is being written right now and I could not be more grateful to each and every one of you and everyone who believed in me for this moment. It is something I will treasure for the rest of my life. Lucy Boyenton, you're the heart of this film. You are beyond immensely talented. You have captured my heart. Thank you so much. 
- [Announcer] Coming up next, a look at best picture nominee, Green Book and the award for best actress. Will the Oscar go to Yalitza Aparicio, Glenn Close, Olivia Colman, Lady Gaga, or Melissa McCarthy? Keep watching to find out. 
- [Woman] If we show emotion, we're called dramatic. If we want to play against men, we're nuts. And if we dream of equal opportunity, delusional. When we stand for something, we're unhinged. 
- [Man] Sue Bird's gonna need to calm down. 
- [Woman] When we're too good, there's something wrong with us and if we get angry, we're hysterical or irrational or just being crazy, but a woman running a marathon was crazy. 
- [Man] Officials tried to pull her off the course. 
- [Woman] A woman boxing was crazy. A woman dunking, crazy. Coaching an NBA team, crazy. A woman competing in a hijab, changing her story, landing a double cork 1080, or winning 23 grand slams, having a baby and then coming back for more, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy and crazy. So if they wanna call you crazy, fine, show them what crazy can do. 
- Today faster than ever the world is changing because opportunity is raging, this reality changing the world we see, intelligence to build it like we always hoped it would be, but it's not really about what technology can do, it's about how it's used by you. In the end it's just a tool so bring it. What's a hammer without a person to swing it? Your possibility is endless. Your limits are few, so here's the real question, what will you do? 
- [Announcer] The Oscars will continue in a moment here on ABC. 
- [Man] It's time to go, Toyota, go connected with a sporty Camry, with the latest tech, compatible with your favorite apps and wi-fi. Now lease a Camry for $219 a month or buy with $1500 cash back or go with a stylish Corolla and lease for just $199 a month or buy with $1500 cash back and two years of no cost maintenance included. Go, see your Toyota dealer today. Toyota, let's go places. 
- [Man] What is character? Is is a quality that forms naturally over time? Or is it a tree that grows out of hard work? Or hardship? The thing about character, is that while it can be hard to define, it's always easy to recognize. Santa Margherita, for who you are. 
- [Man] Do, do your thing. Flee that nest. Seize that moment. Find your inspiration. Be extraordinary. Spread your wings and experience the Mazda CX5 with new signature track and turbo. Mazda, feel alive. 
- [Man] It's a deadly blind spot right under your nose, tonight after the Oscars. 
- [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Amanda Stenberg and congressman, John Lewis. 
- Our final nominee for best picture is a film about bigotry, friendship and growth, based on the story of a white man and an African American man on a journey through the segregated south. 
- I can bear witness that the portrait of that time and place in our history is very real. It is seared in my memory. Black men and women, our brothers and sisters treated as second class citizens, threatened for raising their family or earning a living, beaten and sometimes killed for the crime of trying to live a life with dignity. Our nation battles scars of that time as do I. 
- The characters in Green Book gradually tore down the walls between them, transforming each other in the process. As this film demonstrates, any journey that opens someone's eyes and softens their heart, is one that is worth taking. 
- Young or old, I encourage you to be an active participant in a journey. This is Green Book. 
- [Man] Have you ever driven professionally before? 
- I can drive anything. 
- What other experience do you have? 
- Public relations. 
- I'm about to embark on a concert tour in the deep south. 
- You and the deep south, there's gonna be problems. Get your hands off him now! 
- What are you doing? 
- A letter. 
- Put this down. Dear Dolores, the distance between us is breaking my spirit. Falling in love with you was the easiest thing I have ever done. 
- Either I eat in this room or I'm not performing tonight. 
- It takes courage to change people's hearts. 
- [Announcer] Please welcome Academy Award winners, Francis McDormant and Sam Rockwell. 
- It's an honor for us to be back on stage. Francis do you have anything to add? 
- No, nope. Nope, thank you very much. 
- Here are the nominees for performance by an actress in a leading role. Yalitza Aparicio, Roma. 
- [Francis] Glenn Close, The Wife. 
- What we were talking about the other day. 
- Yes. 
- I want to say that what you implied isn't true and if you malign Joe's talent in any way, I'll take you to court. Good luck, Nathaniel, I'm sure you'll write a fine book. 
- [Francis] Olivia Colman, The Favorite. 
- They are the ones who've give you some for quite some time now. Seemed like the perfect opportunity with Mulbor winning. 
- It is a monstrous extravagance. Mrs. Morely, we are at war. 
- We won. 
- Oh, it is not over, we must continue. 
- Oh, oh I did not know that. 
- [Sam] Lady Gaga, A Star Is Born. 
- I want to do this again. I won't come and find you. Next time you can clean up your own mess. 
- [Sam] Melissa McCarthy, Can You Ever Forgive Me? 
- It wasn't my work, was it, I mean, if I had put in my work, and I would have been opening myself up to criticism and I'm too much of a coward to do that. 
- And the Oscar goes to, Olivia Coleman. 
- [Announcer] This is the first Oscar and nomination for Olivia Colman. 
- (crying) Oh, it's genuinely quite stressful. This is hilarious. Okay, um, I have to thank lots of pe--
