- We have a fairly widespread winter weather advisory. 
- [Announcer] Today on TMZ... 
- This is clearly the roll-up to the Grammys, and Beyonce is skating there. 
- [Katie] Janelle Mon√°e had a roller skating party and her guest of honor was Beyonce. 
- I'm just thinking people actually go out during the weekdays? 
- Celebrities don't go out on the weekend. They go out during the week. 
- If you don't have a real job, it's better to party on those days. 
- I can't go out, like, on a Tuesday, a Monday night, with everybody else. I have to be at work everyday. 
- You also have two young children at home! 
- You have children, Raquel. 
- Ariana Grande is calling the producer of the Grammys a liar. The producer, Ken Ehrlich, said that Ariana pulled out because she was too frazzled and couldn't get a decent performance together in time. Ariana is pissed. She even tweeted: I can pull together a performance overnight and you know that, Ken. 
- When you say the name Ken, you're really mad. Dammit, Ken, you know that about me. 
- We got Matt Gaetz. He is Republican, a representative from Florida. And when we say people are calling you the conservative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez... 
- [Reporter] You think you guys could be a power couple together? 
- I don't know. That might be a little presumptuous of me, but I would certainly swipe right on the opportunity. 
- He's incredibly charming in this video. 
- He represents Pensacola, Florida, which is very conservative. 
- Fun fact, Pensacola, Florida has the most whitest sandest beaches in the United States. 
- Pensacola, even the beaches are white. 
- Jen Selter hit up the beaches of Cabo in this really cute bikini. She looks incredible. 
- Hey, you know what? She's been a little bit thirsty because today the weather is 22 degrees. 
- That's Celsius. 
- Oh. [Music] TMZ kidz [Music] [Music] TMZ kidz [Music] [Music] Let's have fun with-
- [Music] 
- [Announcer] TMZ daddies! Oh, yeah. Goo-goo, ga-ga, Conor McGregor. 
- Conor McGregor just looks so good. 
- He's got a great body and his swagger. 
- [Announcer] He's got so much swagger, even the waves can't knock him down. Now, who's the party pooper? 
- No, the swim diaper keeps all the boo-boo inside. 
- [Announcer] Good to know. So, who's the kid? 
- He's with Conor, Junior, his firstborn sun. It was a warm, winter day in Miami. 
- Aw. 
- [Announcer] Yep, Conor spent an idyllic day by the sea with his one-year-old son, a little too idyllic if you ask this guy. 
- Is this, um, orchestrated? 
- Naw, Conor takes his son everywhere. He took his son to the Superbowl. 
- [Announcer] Yeah, he likes... Being seen with his adorable child. Wait a minute! 
- It's interesting, because it is a way of softening his image after the dolly. 
- [Announcer] As in the dolly Conor hurled at a bus causing painful injuries to a fellow UFC fighter's face? And speaking of faces, it's like Conor's looking into a mirror. Oh! 
- Right now, it's very chilly out here. If you can afford it, why not go to Miami where it's in the high 70s? 
- He's from Ireland. 
- That's even worse than L.A. That's negative, probably, like who knows? 
- I want to open my phone day and have it say negative who knows. 
- Oh my God, that's I need a jacket, it's negative probably who knows. 
- And then you open it up, it says hot as fish grease. 
- [Announcer] Happy dadding! Daddy. 
- Kim Kardashian was on Jimmy Fallon's show and was talking all about her fourth kid, but you really couldn't concentrate because she was so freaking gorgeous in this like skintight snakeskin dress. I know we say this all the time, but it really is the best she's ever looked. 
- She looks amazing every day. It's ridiculous. 
- How long does it take Kim Kardashian to get ready? 
- Hours. Hours. 
- Oh God, to sit there. 
- Why do you care about sitting there? Someone's pampering and you're drinking. Who cares? 
- The worst. It would just drive me crazy. 
- How long does it take you to get ready? 
- 11 minutes. 
- You time yourself? 
- Uh-huh, I know exact, because I have to time myself in the morning. 
- What do you do at the 11th minute? What's the last, like, ugh! 
- Do you wink at yourself? 
- The last one is you got this, Levin. 
- [Announcer] It's one of the biggest feuds in Hollywood. Ariana Grande versus this guy! Who the hell is that, Richard Dreyfus? 
- Ariana Grande is calling the producer of the Grammys a liar. 
- Oh, it's Ken Ehrlich who did an interview saying Ariana Grande, whose face has been used everywhere to promote the Grammys this year, won't be performing after all because he claims she felt it was, quote, too late for her to pull something together, unquote. And now Ariana is clapping back Pelosi-style, calling Ehrlich a liar, liar McLiarson. 
- She said, I've kept my mouth shut, but now you're lying about me. I can pull together a performance overnight, and you know that, Ken. 
- [Announcer] According to Ariana, she wanted to sing her hit song Japanese barbecue, AKA 7 rings, but Ken didn't think the audience would relate, to which Ariana said, thank you, next. So, who do we believe? 
- I am 100% Team Ariana. 
- Nah. 
- They are putting her everywhere, her face everywhere, because they want her audience to come to the Grammys. 
- 7 rings is the number one song in the country right now. That doesn't make any sense to me. 
- Who do we know all this from? 
- I know it. 
- Do we have Ken's comment? 
- What Ken says is that she was too frazzled to pull it together. 
- Right, and it's not true. Did you see the statement? 
- From whom? 
- Ken! 
- [Announcer] Guys, guys! Calm down. Perhaps we need some estrogen to clear this all up. 
- They only let you perform songs that are nominated. That song is not nominated. 
- [Announcer] You tell 'em, girl. Except for one thing. 
- Last year at the Grammys, Childish Gambino performed a song that was not nominated and so did Sam Smith. 
- [Announcer] Women, right? Hey, at least they tried. We'll miss you at the Grammys this year, Ariana. Well, maybe Ken won't, but you know. Everyone else will. 
- I love you, beard. 
- [Producer] Julian Edelman's playoff beard is no more. 
- [Harvey] Oh, you're kidding. He finally shaved it off. 
- And it's because of Ellen DeGeneres. So, Julian Edelman had this epic beard. He's been growing it nine months, so it's around training camp time. He went on Ellen DeGeneres, and she said I'll donate $10,000 to the Boys and Girls Club. 
- But you need to let me shave that beard first. 
- Let's do it. Let's do it. 
- Yay! 
- So, how does he look after it? 
- [Blond Man] So, he's actually a very beautiful man. 
- [Female Staff Member] He's so hot. Oh my God, he's so hot. 
- [Male Crew Member] Is he hotter with the beard or without? 
- [Female Staff Member] Without. He's so hot. 
- [Harvey] Yeah, he's great-looking. 
- Everybody's hotter with a beard. 
- I agree. 
- That's not true. 
- Not true at all. 
- Everybody's better with a beard. 
- No. 
- Yes, girls love, like, a George Michael overgrow. 
- That's not true! Stop saying what we like. 
- Julian Edelman looks a million times better without a beard. 
- No, not at all. No, beards. Beards, man. 
- No, that's not true. 
- Believe me, man. Girls like beards. 
- I don't. 
- No. 
- Not true. 
- Girls like beards because a baby face means-
- 
- Stop telling us what girls like. 
- Girls like beards. 
- [Reporter] Congressman Gaetz, how you doing, man? 
- Good. 
- [Announcer] Fellow Americans, say hello to Republican congressman Matt Gaetz from the great state of Florida. 
- Super conservative, I believe. 
- Very conservative, very much about the wall. 
- [Announcer] In fact, many are calling him the conservative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. 
- Well, that is totally unfair. AOC is way more interesting and attractive and capable than I am. 
- He said capable? 
- Capable. 
- Did he just sandwich that attractive in? 
- Literally right in between the two. 
- [Announcer] Ooh, well, maybe you can get Rashida to pass her a note during session. But you two are so different! For instance, she likes dancing, and you try to get parents of Parkland victims kicked out of a congressional hearing. Listen, the biggest difference in this town isn't whether people are Republicans or Democrats. It's whether they want to shake the place up or not. She does, and I admire her for it. 
- [Announcer] Wow, I don't remember any congressperson ever saying that about another congressperson that way. 
- Republicans, like, usually their line is she's young and stupid. Like, that's what's always their criticism of her. 
- Sometimes, haters just gotta hate, man, and that's not what I'm about. 
- [Announcer] So, what is Matt Gaetz about? Well, he's extremely pro-gun, but is also pro-marijuana, which means you can be prepared for the zombie apocalypse but won't care when it happens. Say, you know who else is pro-marijuana? AOC. 
- I would certainly swipe right on the opportunity to write a cannabis bill with her. 
- [Announcer] Dude. 
- [All] No. 
- Are you kidding me? 
- I think would it help America if those guys, like, started dating. They seem like Romeo and Juliet a little bit, don't they? 
- [Announcer] And that turned out great. 
- If he does take a chance on pissing off his electorate, he represents Pensacola, Florida, which is very conservative. 
- Wait, fun fact. Pensacola, Florida has the most whitest sandest beaches in the United States. 
- Pensacola, even the beaches are white. 
- [Reporter] Thanks, Congressman. 
- [Announcer] Politics! 
- Jen Selter, super popular Instagram model, hit up the beaches of Cabo in this really cute bikini. She looks incredible. 
- She was like the OG butt girl, and now I, I don't even know what the hell happened to her. 
- Jen Selter is still big. 
- I disagree. 
- We haven't heard from her in a while. 
- She has 13 million Instagram followers. She just launched a whole, like, fitness diet plan and everything. She's doing great. 
- [Patrick] If you have 13 million Instagram followers, you can make hundreds of thousands of dollars advertising products on Instagram. She's doing really, really well. Much better than most of the other Instagram models. 
- Hey, you know what? She's being a little bit thirsty, because today the weather is 22 degrees. 
- That's Celsius. 
- Oh. 
- [Announcer] Coming up... 
- Janelle Mon√°e threw the best pre-Grammy party. She did a retro rollerskating party. Her guest of honor was Beyonce, so we have video of Beyonce roller-skating.

- Who introduced Jeff Bezos to his wife Lauren. 
- [Charles] We got him out last night. Nice guy, and he was with-
- 
- [Harvey] Hot model. 
- But that's a subtle message. He's that nice guy. 
- How's that a subtle message? 
- He's the nice guy in the situation. 
- Oh my God. 
- You are an idiot.

- I'm just naturally hyper. (laughs) 
- [Judge Judy Narrator] Judge Judy. Monday at four and 4:30 on Fox 5. 
- [Reporter] What's going on, Janelle? 
- [Announcer] That's singer-songwriter Janelle Mon√°e attending a pre-grammy awards party in L.A. Repping her potential album of the year-
- 
- Dirty Computer. 
- [Announcer] Right. But it was Janelle's pre-grammy party of the same name that really had people spinning. 
- She did a retro rollerskating party, and her guest of honor was Beyonce. 
- [Announcer] Oh, yeah! There's Queen Bey getting her swerves on all over the rink. 
- Beyonce. So, we have video of Beyonce rollerskating. 
- You're like out of breath. 
- I'm so excited, because Janelle Mon√°e and Beyonce rollerskating? It's so cool. 
- [Announcer] Damn right. Beyonce's rocking lucky number seven. Janelle's rocking you're-gonna-get-lucky skintight pants. Model Shaun Ross, Transparent actress Trace Lysette. 
- We have video of her rollerskating? 
- [Announcer] Uh, we kinda just showed it. 
- Beyonce just thought it was like an average Thursday night happening to be like Janelle Mon√°e's party. 
- Celebrities don't go out on the weekend. They go out during the week. That's why I'm pretty much wack now because I can't go out, like, on a Tuesday and Monday nights, like Ace of Diamonds and things like that. I have to be at work every day. 
- You also have two young children at home. 
- You have children, Raquel. 
- [Announcer] Oh, that's it. Alexa, watch children. Gotta roll! 
- I went from sleeping on the floor in a trailer to having a gold record in six months. 
- Danielle Bregoli is breaking records, so she had her own show come out on Snapchat this week, and it's called Bringing up Bhabie. This thing killed it. On the very first day, it got over 10 million views. Snapchat even said if you compare this to Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Keeping Up with the Kardashians gets about 1.5 million views. 
- She's a hit. 
- She's supposed to make 10 million dollars this year. 
- If I had to put my money on a 15-year-old becoming rich and famous, she's gonna be in the top five. 
- Well, she's already rich and famous. 
- So, that's a pretty good win. 
- You really went out on a limb. 
- But you also helped her out a lot. We picture her every other day. Every time that we talk about a lot of people, though, a nobody, we help them out so much, it's insane. 
- And guess what they do after they get famous? 
- Don't talk to us. 
- Exactly. 
- You know what happens when they stop being famous, though? 
- We stop talking to them. So. 
- Ha! 
- So, we'll talk to anybody. 
- That's the party line. 
- [Announcer] And now, As the Bezos Turns. Money, wiener pics, Amazon, dating, Bezos. Yes, it's been a crazy week for the richest man in the world, but now, new drama. His new girlfriend's estranged husband is dating this chick. Wait, we've got a better photo. Oh, right. 
- Patrick Whitesell, the super agent from William Morris Endeavor-
- 
- Also known as Lauren Sanchez's estranged husband. 
- [Announcer] Right, because he was married to her and friends with him and introduced her to him and now they're together. 
- But Patrick is okay because we got him out last night and he was with hot model named Keira Alexa, but they did the thing where they walk out separately. 
- And then get in the same car in the backseat. 
- [Announcer] Slick move, guys. Now tell us about this hot lady! 
- Her name is Keira Alexa. She's a model, and that's all I know about her. 
- [Announcer] Thanks for that detailed report. We'll take it from here. She loves to sell cookies, wear bras, and also not wear bras. Oh, and she looks a lot like Patrick's ex Lauren. 
- She's roughly 25 years younger than Lauren. 
- [Announcer] That explains the cookies. 
- Does it bother Lauren? Probably a little bit. 
- No, Lauren is with Jeff Bezos. 
- [Announcer] Speaking of, he's got some drama of his own with that whole-
- 
- Your semi-erect manhood pressing against your zipper. 
- [Announcer] We were gonna say extortion claims, but thanks for getting specific. 
- So, the interesting thing now is American Media's now saying oops, we're gonna investigate ourselves in this thing, because Jeff Bezos says they tried blackmailing him. 
- The emails were crazy. 
- Why would National Enquirer go get the richest man. Like, that's just dumb. 
- [Announcer] Well, let's break it down in detail. 
- There's a whole bunch of stuff. 
- [Announcer] Right, so. Good luck, Jeff. And Patrick? You already got lucky. 
- Good news, everybody. My new movie came out today. I don't know if you guys noticed, but I'm starring in a new movie. 
- What the hell is this? 
- Yeah, it's true story. It's called High Flying Bird. It's directed by Steven Soderbergh. Zazie Beetz is my costar along with Zachary Quinto. The movie's about the basketball lockout, and during the best scene of the movie-
- 
- Oh, man, this is getting crazy. Jamil Umber and Erick Scott seem to be going at it in public, calling each other out on Twitter. 
- Never want to make these things public, but these guys have. 
- Yeah. That's right. 
- Did you make it? 
- Oh, that's hot. 
- I'm done, I'm canceling my Netflix. 
- You mean you're gonna delete your mom's password. 
- I don't know anyone who has their own account. 
- Oh, you use somebody else's? 
- Are you serious? 
- I use my mom's. 
- Oh my. 
- It's Netflix. 
- How do we get that code? 
- If your parents seen what you might also like and Raquel's got the-

- [Announcer] TMZ online and on your phone, 24/7. And now, TMZ Piracy presents X Marks the Spot, to where disgraced Fyre Festival Founder Billy McFarland hopefully has something valuable buried 'cause he's on the hook for a crap-load of cash. Yarg! 
- So, Billy McFarland is in trouble again. He just got sued for three million dollars and lost. So, this investment company, EHL, funded him three million dollars three weeks before the Fyre Festival, and they never got paid back. So, they now have sued him for the three million dollars plus interest plus legal fees, and they won. 
- [Announcer] Festival co-founder Ja Rule was mentioned in the suit, but isn't on the hook for the three mil, which means they got to get it all from Billy. One question, though. 
- How do you get it from Billy if he's in prison? 
- Well, somebody in prison can still have money. 
- You know that they don't take your money to prison with you, right? 
- Well, yeah. 
- [Announcer] Yes, but hopefully Billy's money is protected via the method any solid financial planner would recommend. 
- Dig a hole in his backyard and put in a bag. 
- It's a pretty good idea. 
- It's a terrible idea. 
- What about under the sea like a lobster trap and then you like bring it up when you're out of prison. 
- [Announcer] Yeah, unless some lobster swipes it and is living large on your cheddar, yo. But here's a better idea for Billy's money. 
- He put it in commissary. You invest it in commissary. 
- Pretty made-up. I've got 14 billion dollars in the commissary. 
- Yeah, that's a lot of instant noodles, huh? 
- [Announcer] Well, the point is, hopefully Billy's got that three mil buried someplace. 
- I know a lot of people who have money buried. 
- You've actually seen people bury money in their back yard. 
- A thousand percent. 
- [Announcer] Wow, that's a lot of percent, so she must be telling the truth. Lying conman goodbye, everybody! Coming up. 
- Sheila E. She sends a little message to her number-one fan.
