- We heard Adrian talk about it, there's no interest. When there's no interest, guess what kind of deal's available to you, the minimum exception. So we might as well put all 30 teams in. 
- Right, no, that's very interesting. Well, we're gonna have to see. We might know more by tonight, right? Could know about Kawhi by tonight. Could know about Boogie by tonight. Come hang out with us, 7:00 eastern on ESPN. Until then, watch your phones cause it's free agency. Lot's going on. 
- Come on US team, let's do it! 
- [Wendi] Coming up on this Tuesday edition of NFL Live, JuJu Smith-Schuster joins us. He'll talk about taking over as Steelers top receiver and what his relationship with Antonio Brown looks like now. We highlight some of the NFL stars that are nominated for ESPYS, including a look back at Drew Brees's record-breaking Monday Night Football performance. Plus, we hand out our own award for the player with the best highlights, Patrick Mahomes, Saquon, or Kyler in the running. Who will be crowned your Highlight King? Happy to have you with us on this Tuesday afternoon, holiday week. Wendi Nix, Dianna Russini, Victor Cruz, and Mike Tannenbaum. We will start with news regarding Cowboys running back, Ezekiel Elliott. Zeke is once again headed to the Commissioner's office. The Dallas Cowboys running back expected to meet with the Commissioner, Roger Goodell, today in New York City regarding a May incident in Las Vegas. The meeting comes after an incident at a Las Vegas music festival in May, in which Elliott had a confrontation of sorts with a security guard. He was briefly detained, but never arrested or charged in the incident. Nevertheless, the commissioner wants to hear him out. Hear what happened. Dianna, what more can you tell us? 
- Oh, at this point right now, we don't know what exactly is going on in that meeting. But they are meeting in Manhattan to discuss Zeke's behavior in that Las Vegas incident. Jerry Jones, of course, has stood by his running back saying that he doesn't see anything wrong with what he saw on video tape. Again, Zeke was in those handcuffs and then those handcuffs were removed, he was not charged. He could still face punishment if Goodell decides that he violated the League's personal conduct policy. That's what this meeting is to discuss. But as of now, we are not sure what the future holds but those that I've spoken to with the Cowboys organization strongly feel confident that Zeke will not face a suspension because of this incident. 
- Mike, as a GM, I know you have players who have had face to face meetings with the Commissioner, who had hearings or due diligence, if you will. What's your take on the process? 
- Despite how the Cowboys are feeling, a suspension certainly is in play. We have to remember under the personal conduct policy, a player can be suspended even though there may not be criminal charges. And the fact that Ezekiel Elliott is meeting in person with the Commissioner signals to me that a suspension, albeit one game, two games, could be in play here, and he was sent to New York for a reason. So we'll see how it plays out in the coming days. But his prior behavior will certainly be a factor in their assessment. 
- Well let's shift gears to between the lines. Victor, how important is the run game to this current Dallas Cowboys team? 
- It's huge, especially Ezekiel Elliott, right? He's been the focal point of that offense, especially from the running back perspective, year in and year out. Things he can do with the ball in his hands, whether out in space or just handing him the football behind that fantastic offensive line. I mean, he is, in my opinion, the heartbeat of that offense. Obviously, Dak is the leader, but Ezekiel is the one that makes them go. As he does well, then you've got the play action pass and everything complements the attributes of Ezekiel Elliott. So obviously, if he's there to miss any significant amount of time, the Cowboys will be looking to replace those statistics and those numbers that he puts up week in and week out in a different way. 
- [Mike] Yeah, and Vic, you just hit the nail on the head. When you look at Dak Prescott, his pass rating goes from 97 to 122, play action compared to traditional drop back. So you could see the importance of the running game. Ezekiel Elliott and obviously opposing defenses are focusing in on stopping Ezekiel Elliott. That's a very impactful, in terms of his impact on Prescott's production to go from 97 to 122, that's a huge jump in terms of his play action productivity. 
- A huge jump, and we'll talk about Dak's deal and when it may get done, but I'd be interested to see how all of you feel like this Dallas Cowboys team stacks up in the division. 
- I think they're right there at the top. I think they're competing, obviously them and Philadelphia, right there neck and neck. Gonna be battling it out throughout the season. But I think they've got all the tools. When you look at them defensively, from the defensive line all the way back to the secondary, they're loaded at each position. And then offensively, like we just talked about, Dak Prescott, Ezekiel Elliott, Amari Cooper, Randall Cobb, Jason, I could go on for days with this. But they have all the talent. 
- [Mike] All the receivers. 
- [Victor] Exactly, they got all of the talent, and not to mention-
- 
- [Wendi] They have a new offensive coordinator which-
- 
- [Victor] Kellen Moore, obviously. Which obviously comes from college and doing those different things. So he'll provide some creativity that we probably haven't seen. Some different type of plays that we haven't seen, necessarily, from the Dallas Cowboys. 
- You're not going with the Eagles, you're going with the Dallas Cowboys to win that division? 
- Yes, unfortunately, nobody in New York kill me, please. But I'm going with the Cowboys. 
- That's right, don't, that was Victor. When does Dak's deal get done? Do we see that done before the start of the season? 
- I think that deal will get done before the start of the season. In fact, even just talking to people in the Cowboys organization about the timing of it, it's funny cause just a few months ago, the way it was being explained to me was, it was gonna be a while, it wasn't gonna get done. And now it seems that, I'm not sure where the pressure's coming from. I don't know why they're feeling the pressure, but in terms of trying to get that done, it seems that that's gonna be a priority for Dallas. 
- You know, the pressure really comes from what Dak Prescott's draft day disappointment was, is now becoming the reality of a free agent opportunity. Because he was not a first round pick, which was a disappointment. But he's now in the final year of his rookie contract. So unlike guys like Jared Goff and Carson Wentz, who had the additional fifth year, he could get to the market and he may not be a perfect player, I'm a believer in Dak Prescott. Not cause only, what he can do from a passing standpoint, but the plays he makes with his legs. If he made it to the open market the way Kirk Cousins did a couple years ago, hard to say what he could get. And, I know people could say well, he could certainly get franchised, but I could tell you from an organization standpoint, when you use the franchise tag, the last position you wanna use it on is the quarterback. Because when you have a franchise tag, that means that the player doesn't have to be there for the off-season program, doesn't have to be there for training camp. He could come in the Tuesday before opening day, sign the tag, get paid for the whole season, and it really puts the whole offense and all those reps that you don't have together, Vic. So it's really a situation where the sense of urgency, Dianna, in my mind, it's coming from the fact that this player is 16 games away from becoming a free agent. 
- And then that quarterback also feels that pressure. And they don't ever really feel like they belong. Do you remember with the Kirk Cousins situation in Washington? He was always out there proving and proving and proving. I remember talking to him about it. You could tell it was wearing on him, because it was like, the Washington Redskins organization, they were just looking to date and date and date, and he was looking for a ring. He wanted to get married and he wanted to feel that love. And he never did. For the Cowboys to put that on Dak, that may not work out for them if they wanna make that work. 
- You know what he's married to, money. A lot of money, I am not crying for Kirk Cousins. But it is a point well made. All right, anyway, circling back to where we started. That is Zeke Elliott, the Cowboys certainly hoping that he will not miss any time. A video shows Browns running back Kareem Hunt being questioned by police after an apparent incident Saturday night. This was at a Cleveland bar. The video published by TMZ Sports. It shows Hunt speaking with a number of officers. He was not arrested, they did not make a police report regard the incident. This, according to a spokesperson to Cleveland.com. Still to come on NFL Live, Steelers star wide receiver, Smith-Schuster, he of JuJu, joins us from across the pond in London. Find out what he's been up to during the off-season. And the story of high school football coach born with one of the rarest conditions in the world. 
- [Rob Mendez] There's definitely doubters out there, like parents, yeah, my son is getting coached at quarterback from a guy that has no legs. That lights a fire under my butt, and probably gets me excited to really just try to prove people wrong about it.

- [Wendi] Press coverage now, from our own Dan Graziano. Sources according to Dan, CBA, that's collective bargaining agreement, talks between the NFL and the player's association are expected to intensify this summer in an effort to get a new deal done by the start of the 2019 season. Three to four negotiating sessions possible in the month of July alone. Former Packers wide receiver, Randall Cobb, signed by the Cowboys in free agency, teamed up with Aaron Rodgers for over 5,000 receiving yards after being drafted by the Pack in 2011. He will face his former team week five in Dallas. He had to say this about moving on from Green Bay. It's like the ex-girlfriend that broke up with you. When you see her five years later, you hope you're in a better situation than you were before. Married, with kids, and you're able to say, Yeah, I did better without you. You know what, he's right. No body says that, but that's how everybody feels. 
- Yeah, but not every breakup has to be contentious. 
- It doesn't matter. I don't care if it's the best breakup ever, you don't wanna be like, oh life wasn't so great. 
- You're winning, I'm not. 
- You wanna win, sorry, it just is what it is. OK, anyway, that got us thinking five years from now, who's better off? OK, we saw a number of NFL breakups, if you will. So again, five year mark. Randall Cobb or the Green Bay Packers, who's better off? 
- I'm going with Randall Cobb. I think he's joining a team in the Cowboys that's a younger team. I think they're an overall better team right now than the Green Bay Packers. But I think in five years, he'll be in the playoffs a couple times. He's obviously in the mix of that wide receiving core. He's gonna be a focal point in that slot position. That's an important position now a days in the NFL. And I think overall, he'll just be better. Dak Prescott, he's got a younger quarterback. I think that'll serve him better. Obviously giving that longevity and be there for a couple years. He can built that comradery and that continuity with Dak, which will serve him better five years from now. 
- All right, he's not gonna miss Aaron Rodgers at all, no. 
- They're a better overall team. 
- Again, five years, we don't know, a lot can happen. 
- They're younger. 
- All right, listen, in my opinion, no more notable breakup than that one between Odell Beckham Jr and the New York Giants. This one's easy if you talk about now, but we're talking about five years from now. Dianna, who's better off? 
- I'm gonna go Odell Beckham Jr is gonna be in a much better position. Well first of all, he got paid. He got tons of money and he has opportunity to make more money. Price of living in Cleveland is lower, taxes are lower. So from a personal financial standpoint, Odell Beckham Jr is winning big time. But when it comes to football, there's no quarterback that I believe has more potential to be one of the greatest, than I believe, in what Baker Mayfield could do. In terms of the continuity and the team that they're building in Cleveland, compared to what they're doing in New York. We're not sure what's gonna happen to Pat Shurmur, if he's gonna be there. You have to feel like he could be on the hot seat this year if it doesn't work. It seems that Cleveland is a much better off space for Odell Beckham Jr, so I think he's gonna look back and go you know what, that was good. 
- That was good. What's interesting is the Giants had a couple of breakups. Also Landon Collins, who's better off in five years? 
- Yeah, I'm gonna go the other way here, Dianna. I'm gonna go with the New York Giants. Dave Gettleman and that front office. When we look at what they've already done to replace Landon Collins. They acquired Antoine Bethea in free agency and Jabrill Peppers, that was part of the trade that send Odell Beckham Jr-
- 
- [Wendi] First rounder, yep. 
- [Mike] To Cleveland. And although Collins is a good player, I thought he was more productive closer to the line of scrimmage. I think when you look at the way Peppers plays, he can replace him. He's younger, more athletic, and less expensive. So Wendi, it's not five years, we know right now. We're better off without Landon. 
- Wow, all right, fair enough, noted. You know, I said there was no bigger breakup. As soon as I said that I thought about AB and the Steelers. I'm gonna retract that. But anyway, Antonio Brown and the Steelers. This one, I think, is tricky. 'Cause again, we're five seasons out, who's better off? 
- I'm going with the Steelers here. I really feel like the Steelers organization as a whole, they're gonna turn the page fully from the Antonio Brown drama. They're gonna be looking to JuJu, he's gonna be tenured. He's gonna be a true veteran leader on that team. Understand who he is. Big Ben, who knows how many years he has left, but with that body frame, and if he takes care of himself, he can still be there five years from now playing at a high level. But these guys are ready to play. I think as a team, as a perspective, once they get rid of the drama and get rid of the negativity that was surrounding the team with Le'Veon Bell and all of these things, I think five years from now, this team will be better, Ben Roethlisberger will be relaxed, and the team will be good to go. 
- All right, perfect segue. How about Le'Veon Bell and the Pittsburgh Steelers? 
- Well, I think we saw a little bit of a sneak preview last year, right? Bell was a Steeler, but he really wasn't. 
- Not really. 
- So we're gonna go with the Pittsburgh Steelers, and obviously we're talking about James Conner, who filled in last year for Le'Veon Bell. We have another year with him now in the off-season program, and I think really where we're gonna miss Bell, guys, isn't as a rusher, but as a receiver. But James Conner is a really good running back. He's productive between the tackles, he's a good pass protector, and again, another year of growing into the job, I think Pittsburgh year in and year out does a great job of letting guys move on. I think that replacing Bell, I agree with Victor, and I think, replace AB, I think they're gonna replace Bell very well with James Conner. 
- I do think that team has sort of rallied around these departures, that's now. We'll see where they are in a few seasons. This last one, I don't even think you can count it as a breakup, I'm not sure they even really dated. I don't know, they went out. 
- It was a hook-up. 
- It was a hook-up, Josh Rosen and the Cardinals. 
- I think Josh Rosen is gonna be better off. Look, this kid had the weight of the world on his shoulders. He was a top draft pick, he was supposed to be the savior. The answer to the Arizona Cardinals organization. Of course, that didn't work out, so here he is in Miami now. The pressure's really off. He's got a new head coach here. They're gonna be running a New England system. By the way, if you run the New England offensive system, you gotta be a smart guy. That's what Josh Rosen is. He's a smart guy, and I think he's gonna fit in well there and it's gonna be a place, by the way, he also will have Fitzpatrick behind him, who doesn't really seem to have the attitude of a starter that doesn't wanna help. So you have two smart guys in a quarterback room, it seems like that's a much better place for Josh Rosen to flourish. 
- Dianna, what about Kyler Murray? You don't think Arizona with Kyler Murray has a chance to be a dynamic play maker and five years from now, we're probably-
- 
- That's really what this question is right? It's an assessment of Kyler Murray in a lot of ways. 
- No, it definitely is, again, the big question mark, of course, is is it gonna work with Kliff Kingsbury. But to me, my biggest issue with Arizona, is last year and this year, is their offensive line. So as much as we can say Kyler Murray can-
- 
- I got five years to fix it, in five years. 
- That's right, he's looking for a GM job right here. 
- No, I'm not! You trying to get rid of me? We've got five years, I'm just-
- 
- Breaking up is hard to do. 
- You gave us five years, right? 
- I gave you five years, I did. 
- That's a lot of drafts. 
- Fair enough. All right when we come back, JuJu smith-Schuster isn't thinking five years, he's thinking right now. We'll talk role models and Steelers culture coming up. 
- Hi I'm JuJu Smith-Schuster, and I'm gonna tell you how much fun I'm having this off-season. [Music] Break break chains that hold me down [Music] [Music] I make make waves all around [Music] [Music] Still unstoppable [Music] [Music] I'm still unstoppable [Music]

- [Commentator] That is JuJu Smith-Schuster. Smith-Schuster past mid-field. A leaping grab by the man called JuJu. JuJu, JuJu Smith-Schuster in the back of the end zone. Wow! 
- We're joined this afternoon by JuJu Smith-Schuster, who's making his way all the way across the Atlantic. He is in London this afternoon for the NFL academy where he's an ambassador. JuJu, tell us exactly what that is and what it means there in London. 
- So here in London, we're working with the NFL academy, which is an amazing thing because they give the opportunity to some players, young players, from the age 15 and up, who learn the new game, American football. This is new to them, which is awesome. But it's awesome because it just gives them the opportunity that they have another career, another goal that they can set to play in the states, to play in the NFL. 
- JuJu, we talked to James Conner yesterday. He talked about turning the page, about the changes that had gone on in Pittsburgh during the off-season. What's the temperature of this team as you get ready for training camp? 
- We're at a 70, we're not too cold or we're not too hot. So the weather's really nice right now. In our locker room, everyone's on the same page. Focused on the same goal. Which is amazing because that's what we're all about. We're all about the team, there's no individuals. And we're here to win games and win championships. 
- [Victor] JuJu, talk to me about some of the talent you're seeing out there in London behind you. Any ballers out there? Any future Steelers out there or what? 
- Oh man, there's some talent out here, some potential. You gotta understand, this game is new to them. We started lifting weights at 14, these guys are barely starting at 16 or 17. So if we were to get them on the right page, onto the academy, it would be amazing to start a Pop Warner team, eventually start through middle school, high school, and that would be their academy. 
- All right, JuJu, it's been well documented that Antonio Brown's no longer with the Steelers. Now you're the number one guy. How's it feel, do you feel a difference in the locker room? Are people treating you differently? Are dudes getting your trays of lunch for you? Is it a different feeling being the number one guy? How's it feel? 
- Nah, man, there's no difference. Obviously people say, yo, you're the number one guy this year, but more for myself, I just see more opportunity, not just for myself but for other guys to step up. You talk about AB having 100 catches, over 1000 yards. Those yards, those catches are gonna be spread out between our offense, between James Conner, Vance McDonald, James Washington, Dante Moncrief, a lot of guys. James Samuels, there's so many guys who are getting more touches, more catches, more yards, more YAC, just to help them individually. But at the end of the day, I'm still the same dude in the locker room, same JuJu, the same person. I'm just, last year I was 21 and this year I'm 22, same thing. 
- [Victor] That's what's up. 
- [Wendi] 22 year old version of JuJu Smith-Schuster. JuJu, you referenced the football being spread around, that makes the communication with Ben Roethlisberger all that more important. What's your relationship like with your quarterback? 
- It's amazing, man. Ben is a great leader, a great dude. He took the whole offensive group down to his lake house in Georgia. Amazing, we spent time together bonding, we worked hard, we threw, but at the end of the day, it's more so building that bonding and that connection. What he did for us was amazing. I think it's so crazy that a guy who's been in the league for 15, 16 years, he sees so many guys come and go and for me, I'm only 22 years old. When I met him I was 20 years old and our bond is just gonna keep growing. 
- I know as a superstar athlete that you are, you're always working on something new, you're always working on something new to perfect your game. Gimme one thing you've been working on this off-season to just either get better at, or something you wanna add to your game or whatever the case may be. 
- Man, I been really, really focusing on playing more inside and outside, learning the whole package. Learning the whole offense. That's what separates being on the field the whole game and being on the field for certain plays, certain packages. I think it's great that I'm able to play outside, inside, right side, left side. Move me into slot, playing tight end. That's gonna help out a lot. That's something I've really been focusing on. It's studying that playbook to the next level, and understanding what everybody has on the field. 
- [Wendi] JuJu, we also get to see everything else you do, via social media. Does anybody in the NFL have more fun than you do? 
- Uh, not necessarily, I do a lot of stuff for YouTube, there's a lot of stuff I do on that end. I really love to show my personal side, my fun side, what I do in my free time. Playing Fortnite, do a lot of video games, streaming, Twitch, and making YouTube videos. I think a lot of guys in the NFL, they just post a lot of working out videos. Which, there's nothing wrong with that, you know. But what do they like to do on their free time? Do they like to travel the world? Do they like to just stay at home and watch movies? I think a lot of their fans would love to see that and just get on a more personal base. 
- Well, and some like to go to prom, you know? Which apparently you did recently. Tell us about the prom. 
- So the prom was awesome, a kid, he's from PA, Pittsburgh. Ideally he wanted to take this girl, the girl that he liked a lot, and his best friend ends up taking her. He told his best friend, too, but his best friend kinda went behind his back, took his girl. So he asked me and I'm just like man, let's just one up this kid. We buy a suit, we get a party bus. We basically stole the night away from him and his girl. At the end of the day, we all had a good time. I met the guy, he seems like a good kid. He's great, my friend's great cause he got like 20K followers, Anthony. So he's super excited about his college career coming soon. 
- Yeah, Anthony, one, friends and girl friend, nothing. He wins. 
- Exactly. JuJu, we saw you getting busy on the dance floor, we saw you getting busy on the dance floor right there, talk to me about what celebrations you got in store. I know you're always being creative, you always bring some new stuff to the table. What you got in store for us this year from the celebration standpoint? 
- Man, look, I'm super excited. Yes, I'm the young dude in the room, but I'm very vocal. It's my time to step up, to be a leader. And what I mean by leader, I'm getting everybody on the page to do major celebration. Like, Dante Moncrief, he's older than me but he's gonna do these celebrations. James Washington, all these guys, all my receivers, we're gonna do major celebrations. James Washington's on the same page because we're in the same class. And then you know, I'm still working on Big Ben and the old lineman, they're a lot older than me, so they're vets, they've been there before. We'll see how it all figures out, but major celebrations coming soon. 
- We can't wait, last question. We asked James Conner this yesterday to close things out, why should Steeler fans be optimistic as we look toward 2019? 
- Man, Steeler fans are always there supporting since day one, whether we're doing good or bad. I don't doubt that they'll support us till the end. I'm kinda happy with where we're at right now, we're not the headline. The Browns, they're the team that everyone's watching, what kinda noise they're gonna make. I'm super excited to watch them play, too. See OBJ comment on my post, and I'm commenting on his post. Like yo, can't wait, who's gonna have the best dance moves. But like I said, this year, the fans just support until the end, because we're gonna finish strong. You can always know the Steelers pull through. 
- [Wendi] All right, JuJu, best of luck. We appreciate you being with us. 
- [Victor] Thanks for being with us, Ju. 
- Thank you, I appreciate it. 
- With Antonio Brown now departed to Oakland, JuJu will become Big Ben's number one option, and with that he should receive tighter coverage. Over the last two seasons when facing pressed coverage, JuJu actually though had a better catch rate and yards per target than Antonio Brown. Clearly, Victor, perspective changes a little bit I would think. He's the number one guy, he could say whatever. What kinda pressure, how is it different for JuJu starting this season, than say, last year? 
- I think the only thing different is, like you said, the mindset, the perspective. Obviously you're coming into that locker room and Antonio Brown's not there, it's just you. And now, you become that leader. People are looking to you, you've been there. You understand who you are. I know you're just, what'd he say, 22 years old, but now you become the guy that the younger teammates are looking up to you wanting to know what you're doing, wanting to hang out with you in the off-season. Wanting to just steal a little bit of knowledge from you, your relationship with Ben. They wanna get a head start on what they need to do to get better. And he becomes the guy that leads the charge in that regard. It's pretty big shoes to fill. 
- I think the Steelers have done a great job. I think they were preparing for this for a number of years. There is that whole notion of, we have to win for today and develop for tomorrow. You look at that position in that organization, going back to Mike Wallace, Santonio Holmes, obviously Antonio Brown, Smith-Schuster. They do a great job of getting guys in the pipeline, getting them developed. And now Antonio Brown moves on, Smith-Schuster steps up to be the number one guy. I think they've done a remarkably great job for a number of years, especially at this position. 
- I think that's a great point, and I would argue that outside of New England, they probably do it as well as anybody, in terms of continuity. I know Antonio Brown ended in a way they probably didn't anticipate, but they did anticipate that it would end at some point. And to that end, Mike, and to your point, they seem to be in lockstep with planning for the future. 
- I think there's three things that JuJu Smith-Schuster has to probably focus on this season. It's going from being a great receiver to an elite receiver. He needs to play at that level. Victor touched on the leadership aspect. It's obvious Just from that interview, you can hear he has stepped up to already be that leader. He's talking about trying to get Big Ben and the offensive line to participate in the celebration drills. They obviously have good chemistry there. And then that third layer is being a mentor to those younger guys. So he's gonna be asked a lot more of him as a football player out on the field, and then of course, in the locker room. But if there's one thing, I think, we've learned about JuJu over the years is he attacks everything with open arms, he is an open book himself. He embraces that role, and he wants to be that character guy, he wants to be that good guy. And when you talk to players on the Steelers about JuJu Smith and what his personality is like, because obviously on social media he's so much fun and he can be loud, apparently he does a lot of his work silently. He's not the loudest guy in the room. He's not the one joking around during drills. He likes to have fun, but he's locked in and focused. I think if he can take his game to that elite level, the Antonio Brown conversations that we're gonna be having are gonna feel so long ago. 
- You know what else he said that was really impressive in the interview, he touched on at the end about the Steelers are always there in the end. And it's not where you start in football, it's where you end. And you look at Pittsburgh and New England, those teams always improve during the course of the season. So James Conner, Smith-Schuster in a new role, it's not what they look like in August and September, are they ascending and getting better. And Mike Tomlin deserves so much credit. The player development, the way they coach their players, they get better. And I thought his point was a good one which is hey, we'll be there in the end because that's where they've been year in and year out. 
- It almost feels like they transform and they kinda morph into whatever they need to be to win towards the second half of the season, and that's what keeps them in the hunt year in and year out. 
- Well, and I understand, for all kinds of reasons why everybody's looking to Cleveland. But I think you'd be unwise to sleep on Pittsburgh in any way, shape, or form. Mike Tomlin as the head coach, a veteran squad, this is a good team. I think that you could argue, underachieved last season, we'll see. What do Patrick Mahomes, Saquon Barkley, and Kyler Murray all have in common? They make head turning, highlight reel worthy plays. We'll crown the Highlight King next.

- [Wendi] NBA Summer League action on Friday. Triple header starting at 7:30 eastern on ESPN. You don't wanna miss a special matchup at 9:30 featuring former Duke teammates Zion and RJ Barrett, facing off for the first time in the Association. Press Coverage now from our own Josina Anderson. An update, the NFL and NFL PA have already scheduled CBA negotiating sessions for July 17th through the 19th. It will be the first time both sides engage in talks for three consecutive days, specifically on this pending league deal. Dan Graziano also reporting there is hope of getting a new CBA by the start of the 2019 season. 
- [Dianna] That's great news. 
- [Wendi] Let's take a look at a few NFL players nominated for the ESPYS, shall we? After an impressive sophomore season, where he threw for over 5000 yards and 50 touchdowns and won an MVP for just that. Patrick Mahomes nominated for best male athlete. Saquon Barkley nominated for the best breakthrough athlete. Last season, Barkley burst onto the scene, rushing for 1307 yards. Broke a Giants rookie record. Kyler Murray nominated for best college athlete. He became the seventh player to win the Heisman in OU's history. None of those are too shabby, right? But today we give out the Highlight King award. Is that an ESPY, it's not. 
- It is not. 
- It should be. 
- But it should be. 
- It should be. 
- It definitely should be, but it's funny because my choice here is Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes. He is up for male athlete of the year. 
- But you're crowning him the highlight king. 
- He gets my vote, and here's why. Against the Ravens, facing fourth and nine from the Chiefs 40, Mahomes just did what we had seen him do countless times, which was buy time with his feet. 
- [Mike] Get out of bounds. 
- [Dianna] Relies on his right hand there, finds Tyreek Hill down field. And the best part is after the game, Andy Reed said, Oh yeah, that's exactly how we designed it, yeah, sure Andy. How about against the Broncos? We knew his right hand was magical. Did you just say lucky? 
- [Mike] Lefty. 
- Oh, I thought you said lucky, I was like, I don't think that was luck, Mike! We knew his right hand was pretty magical but his left hand here, spots Von Miller coming right at him. 
- [Mike] Semi-spiral on that. 
- Even when your defense is doing everything they should be doing, there are situations where you cannot beat Pat Mahomes because he comes up with some unthinkable moments here. His athleticism, his vision of the field, and his ability to stay in the pocket and make plays. And of course, outside the pocket is where he's perhaps probably the most dangerous. Victor is here. 
- I'm going with Saquon Barkley, here. 
- [Dianne] Oh wait, he's your Highlight King. Just to be clear. 
- He is my highlight king, Saquon Barkley, because he is a highlight machine. As you can see, he's broken at least 47 tackles on that one to get to the end zone. And this one, I mean, he's just putting his foot in the ground, he will not be denied against Philadelphia. Obviously a rivalry in that division, and he's taking off on that one. In this one, this one's pretty good. OK, we know this guy's good. First of all, tremendous block by 73 right there, but this run is just indicative of the type of athlete that Saquon Barkley is. He can shake guys behind him, in front of him, he's got the speed to outrun anybody in this league. And that's what we see here and it's always on display. And then I get a bonus, Dianna, I get a bonus one here. Mike you'll like this one, a nice little hurdle. 
- [Dianna] Whoa! 
- Plenty of running backs are doing that, only a handful of guys, I could probably count them all on one hand, who can hurdle guys in traffic like that and keep it moving. 
- Can you talk about that mediocre protection, too? He was able to jump. Not to pile on your Giants, but the fact that he was able to do that with that O-line is incredible. 
- Got to do a lot on his own. 
- All right, guys. 
- [Wendi] Mike Tannenbaum. 
- I got Kyler Murray, I was at this game. His resiliency was unbelievable. They got outplayed badly in the first half. He comes out in the second half. He steps up in the pocket, keeps his eyes down the field. That puts so much pressure on a defense. Throws a really accurate pass, this was a great play. Got Oklahoma back in the game. This was another game I was at, West Virginia's defense was horrific in this game. If they were playing flag football, Kyler Murray still would've gone untouched. 
- [Victor] Looks like flag football. 
- Yeah, I tell you what. And this is what Arizona's hoping for. Look at how many guys he can make miss in space and have the speed to take it all the way. The amount of pressure he'll put on defenses will be formidable in the fall because it'll be his arm, and it'll be his feet. Speaking of his arm, look at this one. 
- [Victor] That was a dime. 
- Oklahoma State, big rivalry game. Again, 50 yards down the field, hits Hollywood Brown in stride. This guy is gonna be a dynamic play maker. He is a highlight machine, he is the highlight king maker, and Arizona Cardinal fans, that's what they're looking forward to in the fall. 
- They're hoping, fingers crossed. Listen, we told you we'd let you vote. We narrowed the field, it's one of these three. Highlight King, OK? So go to our Twitter handle @espnnfl. You can vote for one of these three and we'll let you know what you think. Also, by the way, while you're at it don't forget you can also vote on the ESPYS right now. That is at ESPYS.com.

High school football coach Rob Mendez, who will be the recipient of the Jimmy V Award for Perseverance. Born with an extremely rare condition that affects less than 100 people in the world, Mendez found his calling coaching a sport that he was never able to play himself. SC Featured chronicles Mendez's first season as a head football coach, capturing the inspiring and unlikely story of a coach who transformed a group of young athletes from skeptics into believers. 
- [Cable] At this time, I just want to introduce to you somebody that I think can really help turn this program around. A coach that I hired because I was impressed with his knowledge of the game. His passion as a coach blew me away. Everything else that's on top of that, in terms of who he is and what he does on a day to day basis inspires me. Your new coach Rob Mendez. 
- It was awful, it was really, really awful. I didn't have a choice to have an abortion so I had to keep Robert. 
- In the back of my mind, I'm asking him why, why my son. Less than 100 born like him in the world. What am I gonna do with this boy? 
- It was hard to see him, I really didn't wanna see Robert. So I didn't see little Robert for about two weeks because I just didn't know what to do. 
- I just remember staring, there was a lot of staring. It would piss me off, really bad. Like he was not a human or something. 
- [Robert Sr.] But he was different. 
- I'm under arrest, yeah! 
- [Robert Sr.] He sees people staring as an opportunity. 
- Hey everyone out there, you know it's me, Robert Mendez. 
- Things that you and I get to do in 10 minutes might take him an hour. But he never complained about it. 
- [Josie] Robert was just a really easy child. 
- Again. 
- And he just was really, really happy. 
- [Jackie] What's your favorite team? 
- San Francisco 49ers. 
- [Robert Sr.] He's got a gift that doesn't require him to be physical. Making him aware of that, I think he just took the ball and ran. 
- I think the most difficult part of having no arms and no legs is simply not being able to play sports. I don't show it, I'm good at not showing it. But yeah, I get mad. I get mad at God, I get mad at the Lord, like why? 
- His freshman year, he was standing behind the fence at a distance watching them practice. That was the beginning. 
- We wanted to get him involved in the program, so we invited him to be our manager. 
- They didn't know what I could do, they obviously knew I couldn't play, but just to include me, it made me feel a part of it. It made me feel, I guess you can say, normal. 
- He paid attention to us, as coaches, but he learned the game playing Madden football. He created game plans on Madden, and then he'd come to practice and try to create the same game plans and execute them the same way. 
- I started giving Robert a little bit more responsibility with my quarterbacks. 
- [Robert] Eyes on the quarterback, guys. Eyes on the quarterback, eyes on the quarterback, 
- And the next thing you know, he was there running the drills for us. 
- Go, go, go, go, go. Saddleball, when you roll out, big eyes, big eyes, OK? 
- His ability to study the game and his ability to translate those things to the kids is unmatched by most of the coaches that I know. 
- Right in front of the line, right in front of the line. Ram over, W orbit, 46 power. 
- Let's go! 
- Good job, good job! Look it up, be ourselves. I've been overlooked the last three or four years I've been ready for it. When I go to a job interview, sometimes I feel like I'm gonna, scaring is not the right word, surprise them. And I don't know how they're gonna take the surprise. 
- As he rolls out, to be brutally honest, when I first saw that, I'm like, how can this guy coach? And as he comes close, he goes, gimme a fist pump, gimme a fist pump! I just gave him a little fist pump right there on his shoulder. And all that nerves that I had was just melted away. We had other applicants, but I knew in my heart that it would be a great fit for these young athletes. 
- I remember when Coach Cable hired me. Cruising off the campus I was like, yes! I just felt really accomplished. Because it took me so long, I knew I'd been ready for it and I'd been overlooked, and finally somebody gave me the opportunity so I really appreciated that. 
- At this time, I just wanna introduce to you your new JV head coach, Rob Mendez. 
- Appreciate it, thanks Coach Cable. Thank you, Coach. You know, football is my passion. This is gonna be my 13th year coaching. I can't wait to get to know every single one of you. Believe in yourself, believe in your teammates, and believe in what you're doing. Are we clear gentleman? 
- Yes, sir. 
- All right, I'm excited guys. 
- Obviously, it was a little shocking. And there was jokes going around. Typical teenagers, you know, a guy with no arms or legs, not a lot of people have seen that. 
- If you're taken back, that's just natural and that's human. But after the first two seconds, it's just a normal guy. 
- I don't care how good you are! I don't care how experienced you are! You guys are gonna do everything as a team! 
- Though he may not look like a coach, he definitely acts like one. 
- Lax nine, 157! So what we're gonna teach right now is called 31 zone. 
- His knowledge of the game for somebody who hasn't actually gone through it is impressive. On his phone, he could diagram a play faster than I can do with pen and paper. 
- There's definitely doubters out there, like parents. My God, my son is getting coached at quarterback from a guy that has no arms and no legs. One, two, plant, good. That lights a fire under my butt and probably gets me excited to really just try to prove people wrong about it. Perfect, perfect, good job! 
- When they see him and witness him and hear him, I'd like to believe that they take a moment to evaluate themselves, and anything that they've gone through in life can't be more difficult than what he endures on a daily basis. 
- One thing that I care about more than anything is being a family! That is one thing I take pride on, I love people! I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love everyone! So if you guys can't show love on this football field, then you better get off of it! Towards you, Aiden, who am I gonna go to? Whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle. If this was a game-
- It was a fractured orbital bone, and my cheek bone is fractured as well. Couldn't sleep, I couldn't chew. 
- I just felt bad for him. You know, he's got a hard life and I try to make it as easy as I can. Things that you and I take for granted, like brushing your teeth or washing your face or taking a shower or going to the restroom. Robert needs someone to help him. But he's tough. Two days later he was at his practice. 
- Hey Chuck, widen out, widen out, widen out, both of you! 
- And his thing is, now, I gotta be there for the kids. 
- Go to the flat, go to the flat, go to the flat. 
- [Michael] He's been waiting to be a head coach for a long time. 
- I didn't want to let them down. I didn't want to let the kids down. I just can't stay away, I guess. Me being challenged has been my motivation. All I gotta say is who says I can't? 
- [Team] Nobody! 
- Who says I can't? 
- Nobody! 
- [Rob] Who says I can't? 
- Nobody! 
- Who says I can't originally came from me, just having a drive to accomplish whatever people doubted me for. 
- Who says I can't? 
- [Team] Nobody! 
- Who says I can't? 
- [Team] Nobody! 
- Who says I can't? 
- [Team] Nobody! 
- Who says I can't? 
- [Team] Nobody! 
- Who says I can't? 
- [Team] Nobody! 
- Yeah! 
- If he's willing to do all of that, then what are we willing to do? 
- It's go time, we've been working hard all summer long. Prospect on three, one, two, three. 
- Prospect! 
- Prospect! 
- Go kick ass, let's go. Let's go, run 638 stretch. 
- [Announcer] Touchdown! 
- That's how we do that, that's how you do it. Devon, let's go! Those kids fought every single game. I can't remember one game that we were bigger than the other team, but dammit, we got the job done. Oh, yeah, that's what I'm talking about! That's what I'm talking about! We got the momentum, keep it up, let's go! 
- The JV team in the last 10 years has had mostly losing seasons. He just really has done a job that I haven't been able to see other coaches do at that level before. 
- I'm trying to send my Y under, wherever it is, over the middle, because it's gonna be right here. Over the middle. Let's go! Yeah! Give me a hug, both of you guys, good job you guys. Appreciate it, all right, let's go. 
- [Team] Who says I can't? 
- [Rob] What? 
- [Team] Who says I can't? 
- [Rob] What? 
- [Team] Who says I can't? 
- [Radio Announcer] Good morning and hello, Prospect. Ann Sobrato High. Winner today wins the league. 
- [Team] Seven, eight, nine. 
- Remember this, I'm proud of every single one of you! But damn it, we're not done yet! So let's go finish the job off right now! 
- [Commentator] It might take a miracle play to score the only points in this contest. Passes off to his right, intercepted. 4:37 to play in the fourth quarter. Sobrato looking for the first points. Kick on the way, has the distance, and it's good! And Sobrato takes a three nothing lead. 
- Let's just execute guys, right now. OK, this is for the league right here, OK you guys? Rex Nine left, 180 smash, OK, let's do it. 
- [Commentator] Fourth and 14 for the Panthers. Fourth down play, Jackson off to his left and it's incomplete. Sobrato gets the win and takes the division title with a win this afternoon over Prospect. 
- OK, don't worry about it, man. Come on, man. Family is the most important thing, remember that, OK? That's what we built this team off of, was family, OK? We've got good days and bad days, man. And today as a team, that's OK. I'm very proud of the whole team. It's gonna hurt today. And that's OK if it hurts because we cared a lot. Because we love this game of football. I really sincerely want you guys to understand how much I appreciate this. You guys have given me a lifetime of memories. 
- Our opponents, they'd always doubt him cause they see a man in a wheel chair. To us, we see our coach, who's perfect. 
- When we're pushing him off the field after games, it makes me feel proud to have him as my coach. 
- [Rob] Let's go with that flood play. 
- These kids would follow him no matter where he go. You can actually see the changes in the kids. 
- Great game, can I give you a hug? Can I get a hug, good game, brother. 
- You want the best for your children, and I told him one time, you know, there's not a lot of money in this, Robert. And he told me, not everybody does what they do for money. He's right. 
- It gave me the feeling of importance. And I don't think they know that and understand that. Maybe they will one day but, I love those kids and I'm always gonna remember them. Yeah. I think we make a perfect team. Can we agree on that? 
- [Team] Yes, Coach! 
- Can we agree on that? 
- [Team] Yes, Coach! 
- Who says I can't? 
- [Team] Nobody! 
- Who says I can't? 
- [Team] Nobody! 
- Who says I can't? 
- [Team] Nobody! 
- Yeah! 
- [Player] Way to go, Coach! All right, guys.

- [Announcer] Stuber, in theaters July 12th. 
- [Wendi] UFC 239, Saturday in Las Vegas. Two of the greatest UFC champions defending their titles. Jon Bones battles Thiago Santos and Amanda Nunez takes on Holly Holm in the co-main events on pay-per-view. That's starting at 10 eastern. Go to ESPNplus.com/PPV. JuJu Smith-Schuster will enter training camp as the Pittsburgh Steelers number one wide receiver for the first time in his career. Here is Smith-Schuster from earlier today on what it's like, and the expectations of stepping into that role. 
- I mean, obviously people say, Yo, you're the number one guy this year. But more for myself, man, I just see it more opportunity, not just for myself but for other guys to step up. You talk about AB having 100 catches, over 1000 yards. Those yards, those catches are gonna be spread out between our offense. Between James Conner, Vance McDonald, James Washington, Dante Moncrief, a lot of guys, James Samuels. There's so many guys who are getting more touches, more catches, more yards, more YAC, just to help them individually. At the end of the day, I'm still the same dude in the locker room, the same JuJu, the same person. I'm just, last year I was 21, this year I'm 22, same thing. 
- Yes, the older, wiser, more mature, 22 year old JuJu Smith-Schuster. With a good YAC reference, always a good day. 
- Always. 
- All right listen, this got us thinking, obviously big shoes to fill with Antonio Brown departed. He's now an Oakland Raider. So let's go one by one, receptions, more or less. Antonio or JuJu, Mike? 
- Yeah, JuJu just made all my points for me. They're gonna spread the ball around in Pittsburgh, plus you have a head coach in Jon Gruden who's the play caller. They gave up a lot of money and picks to get AB. AB will have more receptions. 
- I do think Jon Gruden motivated to get Antonio Brown the football. How about touchdowns, Dianna? 
- Touchdowns, I'm gonna go with AB as well. You know, you actually teed me up perfectly there, Wendi, because I think if there is anyone that wants to make Antonio Brown work in Oakland, cause they have to figure out why they pay him all that money, it's gonna be Jon Gruden. So he's obviously calling all the shots on offense here, and in terms of wide receivers in the game, we can debate all day long who is the best, but we all know how special AB can be. As soon as he can figure out that chemistry with Derek Carr, I think he's gonna have more touchdowns than JuJu. 
- All right, there's receptions, there's touchdowns, and how about all purpose yards, Victor Cruz? 
- I'm gonna give JuJu some love here, because clearly Mike and Dianna have not given him any love so far, but I'm going with yards. He's the bonafide number one guy now, which means in those pressure situations, Ben will be looking to him to be that number one receiver and get him the ball in space, either on drag routes, deep routes, he can run any route in the book. And it's gonna be interesting to see just how they use him as the number one guy. 
- Look, it's a team game and all of those things are what they are, but what really matters, of course, you hope anyway, are the number of wins from each of these teams. We've got the Steelers, we've got the Raiders. Who gets the edge here? 
- Yeah, it's gonna be Pittsburgh. I think we're gonna see an improvement with Oakland, especially on offense. Josh Jacobs, Terrell Williams, obviously AB, another year with Derek Carr and Jon Gruden, really worry about defense and rushing the passer. Obviously they lost Khalil Mack a year ago. While they drafted Clenin Ferrell from Clemson in the first round, it's gonna take a while for him to get going but I think they're gonna be a work in progress in terms of how they are on defense. I'm going with Mike Tomlin and a very mature Pittsburgh Steeler organization. 
- I think that's a pretty good bet. How about celebrations, is this even a question? Well I guess, maybe. 
- It's not a question at all. I'm going with JuJu, mainly because it doesn't even have to be him that has to score to do the celebrations. 
- [Wendi] He's made that clear! 
- He's made that clear, everybody's in on this thing. So whether it's him or whether it's Vance McDonald or whether it's any other person on that team. They're gonna be celebrating and JuJu will be leading the way. 
- [Wendi] And let me tell you, if you did not see it, JuJu was with us about an hour ago and he said that he is working on Ben Roethlisberger to get involved. He has not committed, but he's trying. 
- [Victor] We'll see him in there. 
- We'll see about that. 
- I like that you've become the resident celebration expert for us. It's like anything celebration, we have to go to Victor. 
- Here I am, taking a bow for you. 
- We have one more category, one more category. How about we do the drama. 
- Uh oh. 
- Ah, the drama. 
- Is it on there or no? 
- Let's see here. 
- I guess not. 
- All right, pretend. 
- We'll just show the drama. Speaking of drama, I'm gonna go with what history says and I think it's gonna be Antonio Brown on this one. Stick with that thought. I like the way JuJu Smith-Schuster is maturing into not just a mentor to these younger players, but an actual leader on the Steelers team. And for Antonio Brown, there are a lot of personalities on this roster now. Obviously we know Jon Gruden is the focal point of this team no matter who's on it, but I think there's going to be points during the season where the AB of Pittsburgh will show it's face in Oakland. 
- You cannot tell, we will not get through this season without him getting irked with Derek Carr. There's no way. 
- It takes one sailed ball and he's gonna come back like, really, really? 
- Put some money on it. The ESPYS are right around the corner. Who is getting your vote for the best record breaking performance? Come on here, you know Drew Brees wants your vote.

- Are you OK? 
- [Narrator] Even when I was there, I never knew when my symptoms would keep us apart. So I talked to my doctor about Humira. I learned Humira can help get, and keep UC under control when other medications haven't worked well enough. And it helps people achieve control that lasts, so you could experience few or no symptoms. 
- [Ad Announcer] Humira can lower your ability to fight infections, including tuberculosis. Serious, sometimes fatal, infections and cancers, including lymphoma, have happened. As have blood, liver, and nervous system problems. Serious allergic reactions and new or worsening heart failure. Before treatment, get tested for TB. Tell your doctor if you've been to areas where certain fungal infections are common, and if you've had TB, Hepatitis B, are prone to infections, or have flu-like symptoms or sores, don't start Humira if you have an infection. 
- [Narrator] Be there for you and them. Ask your gastroenterologist about Humira. With Humira, control is possible.

- You go first. 
- [Announcer] A message from The Foundation for a Better Life. 
- [Wendi] Next. 
- [Commentator] Drew Brees finds himself only 35 yards away. 
- [Drew] It's about us, it's about our strength, on one! 
- [Commentator] Just Peyton Manning left to pass. 
- Blue 80, set. 
- [Commentator] He starts in shotgun, drops back. Looks to the far side, wide open! and Smith, what a way to do it. 
- I love you, bro, I love you, bro. 
- [Commentator] Drew Brees is the NFL's all time leading passer. 
- Hey boys, how about that, huh? 
- [Commentator] There's only one word that comes to mind. Greatness. 
- Well, we continue to highlight some of the stars around the NFL that earned ESPY nominations this year. The amazing moment from Drew Brees is up for the ESPY for best record breaking performance. Brees broke the NFL passing record when he passed Peyton Manning's mark of 71,940 yards. Victor, you made this point yesterday, and it's true. I think last year was his best bet at winning the MVP. He just had this pesky little Patrick Mahomes who did things that just didn't seem possible to keep Brees from winning that award. 
- Exactly, and then how do you amass such a monumental record like this on an illustrious career that he's had and not win the league MVP one time? I mean, obviously Peyton Manning won a couple of those, Tom Brady, all those tremendous players. But he's gotta get it one time. He's putting numbers up each and every year. I think there's years that he kinda just goes under the radar out there in New Orleans with those play makers and everybody he's got. I think this is the year where he's like, you know, we'll put a nice pretty little red bow on this career and put an NFL league MVP under my belt and get back to the big dance, hopefully and keep things going. 
- So in fairness, he has been a Superbowl MVP. Two time offensive player of the year. But the Hall of Fame quality quarterback that Drew Brees is, you would like to see him go. Although, I know he'd take another Lombardi trophy any day of the week. 
- Now that, you can't dispute. But at least give him one league MVP. He's earned it. 
- We'll show you why, how about this. How about the best of the best of Drew Brees. 
- [Victor] This is vintage, right here. 
- [Wendi] Yeah, vintage, '04, he was at Georgia. Play action, deep to Eric Parker, breaks a tackle for a 79 yard touch down. 
- [Victor] I like it, showing that arm off real early. 
- [Wendi] Black and white there. 
- [Victor] Real pixelated, grainy, I love it. 
- [Mike] Pixelated? 
- [Wendi] There you go, 2014 against the Packers. Brees steps up, just lays this one perfectly into the arms of Brandon Cooks. A 50 yard touchdown strike. 
- [Victor] What a dime. 
- [Mike] You know what else is great? 
- [Wendi] That is a dime. 
- [Mike] He's stepping up in the pocket. A lot of times you see younger quarterbacks step up in the pocket and just check it down. He's stepping up in the pocket and keeping his eyes down the field, puts so much pressure on a defense. 
- [Victor] Teach tape. 
- [Wendi] '06 against the Bengals. The handoff here, it's a flea flicker. 
- [Victor] Love it. 
- [Wendi] And then Joe Horn there, between two defenders, a 72 yard touchdown. And it's that kinda arm that we see. And that's Victor Cruz-esque right there. 
- [Victor] I like it, Joey. 
- [Wendi] Moving now to the modern day-
- 
- [Victor] I miss the cellphone Joey. 
- [Wendi] Against the Panthers. Brees here to Ted Ginn in the end zone. 49 yards right there. 
- [Victor] The consistency that we're seeing here is with, he's not even being touched. There's barely even people around him while he's making these throws. That's indicative to the type of team he's been around, that offensive line taking good care of him. 
- [Wendi] '06 NFC championship, Saints and Bears. Brees here to Reggie Bush. 
- [Mike] That's a great example of a really effective quarterback play. Sometimes you have to throw it as hard as you can. That was a great touch throw. He led the running back, who takes it all the way, but what touch he has. And that's such an underrated aspect of playing quarterback. 
- [Wendi] Then 2016 against the Raiders. The longest career pass, is this a 98? 
- [Victor] Yep. 
- [Wendi] Oh, he's got the-
- I'm sure he wishes he was one yard back. 
- [Wendi] Well he's got a little yards after catch here. To Brandin Cooks, an incredible career. Certainly I think the Hall of Fame. 
- [Victor] Gotta miss him on that one. 
- And perhaps a future NFL MVP. You can vote on the ESPYS right now at ESPYS.com. Again, Brees up for record breaking performance along with three other moments including Klay Thompson's record for three pointers in a game with 14. All right, we gave you our opinion, but who are you crowning the NFL Highlight King? Is it Mahomes, Saquon, Kyler? Dennis Green let's us know what's happening next.

- So you were saying you were handicapped from the get go? 
- It was tough. 
- OK, no crying in the big leagues, Mike. 
- So put the pressure on you, then. So are you going with team Victor with Saquon Barkley, or team Dianna Russini with Patrick Mahomes? 
- I'm a free agent, I'm going with the highest bidder.
