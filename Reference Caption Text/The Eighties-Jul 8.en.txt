- It seems that television has become a kind of electronic confessional. 
- It is juicy, newsy, exciting stuff. 
- What are we doing here? Why did we start this business? 
- Any tool for human expression will bring out both the best and the worst of us and television has been there. 
- [Announcer] Here's Michael at the foul line. A shot on Ehlo, good! 
- They don't pay me enough to deal with animals like this. 
- Why don't you just get off my back, okay? 
- People are no longer embarrassed to admit they watch television. 
- Hello. 
- People used to say, I was there. Now they say they watch it on television. 
- [Dick] Slowly but surely, the 1970s are disappearing. The 1980s will be upon us. What a decade it is coming up. Happy New Year! 
- As you begin the 80s, in the television world, the landscape was, on any given evening, nine out of 10 people were watching only one of three networks. 
- More than 30 million people are addicted toit. Social critics are mystified by its success. What is it? It's television's prime time prairie pot boiler, Dallas. 
- A move like that'll destroy all of Ewing Oil and it'll ruin our family name. 
- I assure you, a thought like that never crossed my mind. 
- Brother or no brother, whatever it takes, I'll stop you from destroying Ewing Oil. 
- Dallas really did establish new ground in terms of a weekly, one hour show that literally captivated America for 13 years. 
- Dallas is a television show which, in some ways, is rooted in the 1970s, and one of the crazy things that emerges is this character, JR Ewing, as a pop phenomenon. 
- Tell me, JR, which slut are you going to stay with tonight? 
- What difference does it make? Whoever it is has got be more interesting than the slut I'm looking at right now. 
- He was such a delicious villain. Everyone was completely enamored by this character. 
- At this point, so many people were watching television that you could do something so unexpected that it would become news overnight. 
- Who's there? 
- The national obsession in 1980 around who shot JR, it's hard to imagine how obsessed we all were with that question. But we were. 
- Who shot JR is about as ideal a cliffhanger as you possibly could get. 
- Who did shoot JR? We may never get that question. The people who produce that program are gonna keep us in suspense for as long as they possibly can. 
- We shot JR and then we broke for the summer. Then, coincidentally, the actors went on strike and it delayed the resolution and it just started to percolate through the world. 
- I remember going on vacation to England that summer and that's all that people were talking about there. 
- [Jessica] We know you don't die. You couldn't die. 
- Well, we don't know that. 
- [Jessica] Well, how could you die? You couldn't come back next season. 
- That's what I mean. I couldn't come back, but the show could still go. 
- [Jessica] Oh, but you wouldn't. What is that show without JR? 
- Well, that's what I figure! 
- Well, I guess if you don't know by now who shot JR, you probably do not care. But last night, some 82 million Americans did and they watched the much touted Dallas episode. It could become the most watched television show ever. 
- Who shot JR is a reflection of old fashioned television. It's a moment that gathers everybody around the electronic fireplace which is now the television set. 
- Now, about one special American television program, a critic said, It transcends in popularity every other American statement about war. And something special happened today to mobile Army Surgical Hospital 4077 that will touch millions of Americans. 
- It was the kind of event that would draw the world's breath. Stage nine, 20th Century Fox Studios, the end of the Korean War, the television version, MASH. 
- It's been an honor and a privilege to have worked with you and I'm very, very proud to have known you. 
- There were those landmark times when shows that had been watched through the '70s and into the '80s, like MASH, had its final episode and we were all sad to see them go. 
- I'll miss you. 
- I'll miss you, a lot. 
- [Reporter] All over the country, armies of fans crowded around television sets to watch the final episode and to bid MASH farewell. 
- The finale of MASH was unprecedented. 123 million people watched one television program at the same time. 
- You know, I really should be allowed to go home. There's nothing wrong with me. 
- When we ended the show, we got telegrams of congratulations from Henry Kissinger and Ronald Reagan. The size of the response and the emotional nature of the response that we were getting was difficult for us to understand. 
- Who shot JR and the last episode of MASH are the last call for the pre-cable world of television. It's like they are the last time that that huge audience will all turn up for one event. 
- TV is growing up with cable. TV is growing up with content. TV is growing up with different genres. 
- The fundamental thing that cable did, the VCR did, or the remote control did is it gave consumers more choice and everything was about to change. 
- Dear Lexus. 
- Dear Lexus.

- Thomas Magnum? 
- Marion Hammond? 
- The private investigator? 
- You're probably wondering about the goat? Just let me drop off my friend and then we'll talk. 
- When we entered the 80s, a lot of one hour dramas that were light hearted like Magnum PI were very popular. 
- After MASH went off the air, the next season, there wasn't a single sitcom in the top 10. First time that had ever happened in TV history. 
- The prevailing feeling was that the sitcom was dead. 
- [Jeff] Brandon Tartikoff, NBC programming chief says, reports of the sitcom's death were greatly exaggerated. 
- Time and time again, if you study television history, just when someone is counting a form out, that is exactly the form of programming that leads to the next big hit. 
- So 1984, The Cosby Show comes on. Now, Bill Cosby's not new to TV. He's had other TV shows, but The Cosby Show is very different. It stands apart from everything else he's done. 
- Mom, I wanted my eggs scrambled. 
- Coming right up. 
- They talked about parenting. Previous to that, on television, the kids were cool and the parents were idiots. And then Cosby says the parents are in charge and that was something new. 
- Instead of acting disappointed, because I'm not like you, maybe you can just accept who I am and love me anyway, because I'm your son. 
- That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life. 
- It helps the casting of anything helps a lot in television and the kids were just great. 
- If you were the last person on this earth, I still wouldn't tell you. 
- You don't have to tell me what you did, just tell me what they're gonna do to you. 
- Unlike every other show on TV, it's showing an upper middle class black family. And this wasn't All In The Family. They weren't tackling deep issues, but that was okay. The mere fact that they existed was a deep issue. 
- The decade was waiting for something real, in other words, unless it's real, it doesn't seem like it moves anybody. If someone's feeling something, you get to the heart, you get to the mind. And if you can hit the hearts and minds, you've got yourself a hit. 
- How was school? 
- School, dear, I brought home two children that may or may not be ours. 
- Cosby Show brought this tremendous audience to NBC and that was a bridge to us. Our ratings went way up. [Music] Sometimes you wanna go [Music] [Music] Where everybody knows your name [Music] 
- Even the theme song to Cheers put you in a good mood. 
- Evenin' everybody. 
- [All] Norm! 
- Norman. 
- What's shaking, Norm? 
- All four cheeks and a couple of chins, Coach. 
- By the end of the Cheers pilot, not only did you know who everybody was, but you wanted to come back and see what was gonna happen. It's like all you have to do is watch it once, you're gonna love these people. These are universal characters and the humor worked on so many levels. 
- Last night, I was up 'til two in the morning finishing off Kierkegaard. 
- I hope he thanked you for it. 
- You have to create a community that people are identifying with and Cheers gives you that community. 
- Boy I tell ya, I've always wanted to sky dive, I've just never had the guts. What'd it feel like? 
- Well, I imagine it's a lot like sex, ay. Well, not that I have to imagine what sex is like. But I have plenty of sex. I have plenty of this, too. Why don't you just get off my back, okay. 
- In the first episode, there was a rather passionate annoyance. I was saying, uh, something's going on here. A really intelligent woman would see your line of BS a mile away. 
- I've never met an intelligent woman that I'd wanna date. 
- On behalf of the intelligent women around the world, may I just say, phew. 
- When we saw what Ted and Shelley had together, we said, oh no, you gotta do this relationship. 
- Ted and I understood what they were writing right away. 
- If you'll admit that you are carrying a little torch for me, (audience laughing) I'll admit that I'm carrying a little one for you. 
- Well, I am carrying a little torch for you. 
- Well, I'm not carrying one for you. Diane knew how to tease Sam, Sam knew how to tease Diane, and I guess we knew how to tease the audience. 
- This incredible chemistry between the two of them ignited the show and that's what drove the show for the first five years. 
- What the matter? 
- Oh, I'm devastated. I need something expeditious and brutal to numb my sensibilities. Blast me into sweet oblivion. 
- How about a boilermaker? 
- Make it a mimosa. 
- We had the luck to be able to rotate the cast and every time we put somebody in, there were explosions. 
- Bwoah. 
- There was something very special about that setting, those characters, that I never got tired of writing that show. 
- Sophisticated surveys, telephonic samplings, test audiences; all of those things help to separate winners from losers and make mid-course corrections. But you can't cut all comedies from the same cookie cutters. All you can hope is that every night turns out like Thursday. 
- Yo, Angela! 
- Larry, Larry. 
- Next. (gavel banging) 
- How rude! 
- He's quick, I'll give him that. 
- All of television said, oh, well, maybe the sitcoms are alive again. And that's all that it took, it took one success. 
- A few years from now, something new may tempt the people who pick what we see, but it's a very safe guess that whatever gets hot for a season or two, the men and women who create good television comedy will be laughing all the way to the bank.

- [Announcer] CNN Special Report, The Hidden Workforce, Undocumented in America, Friday at 10. 
- All right, that's it, let's roll. Hey, let's be careful out there. 
- [Female] Dispatch, we have a 911, armed robbery in progress. 
- [David] When quality does emerge on television, the phrase too good for TV is often heard. One recent network offering that seems to deserve that phrase is Hill Street Blues. 
- Hill Street is one of the changing points of the entire industry in the history of TV. 
- We had all watched a documentary about cops and it had this real hand-held, in the moment quality that we were very enamored of. 
- The minute you looked at it, it looked different. It had a mood to it. You could almost smell the stale coffee. 
- We didn't wanna do a standard cop show where, you know, you got a crime and you got your two cops and you go out and you catch the bad guy and you sweat him and he confesses and that's it. Cops have personal lives that impact their behavior in profound ways. 
- Well, what about it? Is he here or is he out there? 
- Just don't get excited, Counselor, we're working on it. 
- How's this for logic, Furillo? If he's not here and if he's not elsewhere, he's lost. 
- We didn't say that, Counselor. 
- You've lost my client. Never in my entire life have I listened to so much incompetence covered up by so much unmitigated crap. Find my client, Furillo, or I swear, I'll have you up on charges. 
- There'd be these ongoing arcs for these characters that would play out over five, six episodes, sometimes an entire season and in a way, for certain stories, over the entire series. And no on had really done that in an hour long dramatic show. 
- These past four months, I've missed you. I had to find that out. Come home, pizza man. 
- I think in the past, people had watched television passively. And, the one thing I think we did set out to be were provocateurs. 
- The Eli Jackson report, you fill it out. 
- What the hell's the matter with you, man? 
- I'll tell ya something, they don't pay me enough to deal with animals like this. The first thing they see is a white face and all they wanna do is dog ya. 
- Listen to me, Renko, it was a white face that pulled the trigger, not a black one. It was a white one. 
- It set a trend. The idea that the audience can accept its characters being deeply flawed, even though they were in this uniform. I thought that that was important to finally get across. 
- Don't do that! No biting! 
- We wanted to make a show that made you participate, made you pay attention, and I think that worked pretty well. 
- And the winner is... 
- Hill Street Blues! 
- We got 21 nominations and we went on to win eight Emmys and it put us on the map, literally, and that's when people finally checked us out. 
- Programing chief of one of the networks, he used to say to me about shows like Hill Street and St. Elsewhere, what the American public wants is a cheeseburger and what you're tryin' to give 'em is a French delicacy. And he said, your job is to keep shoving it down their throat until after a while, they'll say, that doesn't taste bad and maybe they'll even order it themselves when they go to the restaurant. 
- Nice of you to join us, Dr. Morrison. 
- The success of Hill Street Blues as a critical phenomenon influenced everything that came after. And then, of course, you saw shows like St. Elsewhere. 
- Do you know what people cal this place? Not St. Eligius, St. Elsewhere, a place you wouldn't wanna send your mother-in-law. 
- When it first came on, it was actually promoted as Hill Street Hospital. 
- You give your patients the wrong antibiotics, you don't know what medications they're on, you write the worst progress notes, you're pathetic. Pathetic! 
- Phil! 
- What? 
- Dr. Morey needs you right away. 
- I'm sorry. 
- St. Elsewhere broke every rule there was and then built some new rules. 
- Bobby, the bloodbank called a little while ago. They ran a routine panel on that pint of blood. The T cell count was off. 
- They would have tragic things happen to these characters. There was real heartache in these people's lives and you really felt for them. 
- I've got AIDS? 
- Television at its best is a mirror of society in the moment. 
- St. Elsewhere challenged people and it challenged you as an actor, much less the audience, to think. The stuff they gave you was extreme and what they did, whether they were dealing with AIDS or having one of their main doctor characters raped in a prison, they tackled lots of difficult subjects. 
- St Elsewhere was run by people who were trying to stretch the medium and in the 80s, television producers were encouraged to stretch the medium. 
- Okay, clear. 
- As the 80s got serious, there was more drama, they were getting a little bit more adventurous with the types of shows that were getting a shot. 
- What are you doing? 
- I'm doing what I-
- 
- Should've done all along. 
- What I wanted-
- 
- To do originally. 
- What I should've done-
- 
- Last night. Stop that, David! 
- I'm calling-
- 
- The police, David! Hello, police. 
- [Maria] The networks realized there was an audience looking for something less predictable than traditional prime time fare. 
- Moonlighting was another of those shows that said, okay, I see the formulas that we've had up to here. Let's do different things. 
- Hello. 
- Hello. We're looking a little pale today, aren't we? And who have we here? 
- I don't know. 
- Moonlighting was a really experimental show. They had a Shakespeare episode. They had a black and white episode. They did a musical episode. They tried a lot of different stuff. 
- I don't give a flying fig about the lines in my face, the crow's feet by my eyes, or the altitude of my caboose. 
- Well, I'm at a loss. I don't know what a flying fig is. 
- That's okay, they do. 
- There's no trouble on the set. There is no trouble on set. 
- Well, we have a very volatile relationship. There is a hate-love element to it. 
- The flirtations were great, Bruce and Cybil were great. Glen Caron kept them apart for a long time and bravo to him. 
- What they did was they took the Sam and Diane dynamic from Cheers and escalated it. Cheers was will they or won't they. Moonlighting was do they even want to? 
- Stay away from me. 
- Here I come. 
- But I don't want you. I never wanted you. 
- Yeah, right. 
- Does entertaining mean, at some point, stopping the tease of Dave and Maddie? I mean, do they get together-
- 
- I hope so. 
- At some point. 
- Well, that's gonna be resolved this year. We like to think of it as two and 1/2 years of foreplay. 
- People who've been watching Moonlighting for years were waiting for this moment. And your emotions are already there, built on to the emotions that you're seeing on the screen. So when Be My Baby by The Ronettes starts playing, it's like a perfect storm of romance. [Music] The night we met I knew I needed you so [Music]

- Ode to Esurance. 
- Or delicious. Or fun. [Music] Splash under the sun [Music] But since you need both car and home insurance, why not bundle them with Esurance and save up to 10%, which you can spend on things you really wanna buy like well, I don't know what you'd wanna buy because I'm just a guy on your TV. Esurance, it's surprisingly painless. [Music] Take me to your best friend's house [Music] [Music] Stroll around this roundabout [Music] [Music] Oh yeah [Music]

- Lavender, yes it is. It's for men. 
- But I like the smell of it. 
- This is something big. 
- This is something bigger. 
- That is big. [Music] I'm moving on up-
- [Music] 
- [Child Voiceover] Not as big as that. 
- [Group Voiceover] Big! 
- [Child Voiceover] Bigger! 
- [Group Voiceover] Big! Bigger! 
- [Child Voiceover] This is big. And that's bigger. 
- [Ron Voiceover] Apollo 13 was a real turning point for me. 
- Houston, we have a problem. 
- I learned the power of a true story, how an audience begin to lean in when they know you're dealing with the truth. 
- Coach, it's kind of hard to see the ball. 
- I've been there. I had a TV service with hardly any sports in 4K. Couldn't see any of the quality details. I switched to DirecTV. Now I get the most live sports in 4K. 
- So, how does that help me? 
- It really doesn't. I don't know why I told ya that. Go get 'em sport. 
- Live sports that aren't in 4K are just kinda TV. Don't just kinda TV, DirecTV. Don't have 4K, call 1-855-Watch4K and ask for it today. 
- Mr. Goodson. 
- Not enough shelter for us people on the street. 
- Who is us? 
- [Female Voiceover] So now is probably not a great time to get my library card? [Music] We are [Music] 
- I am not prepared to be in a standoff with a cop. 
- [Stuart Voiceover] Why do all this, for what? 
- Let 'em know that we still matter. 
- Sir, you're gonna have to put your clothes back on. 
- [Announcer] The Public, buy or rent today and watch any time, any where on your favorite screens with DirectTV Cinema. Movies start at channel 125. 
- [Announcer] New Day, tomorrow morning, starting at six Eastern on CNN. 
- There are a lot of people who used to say, I was there. Now people say they watched it on television. 
- There's just a lot of excitement connected to sports in the 80s. You used to have to depend on the five minutes at the end of your local newcast. There just hadn't been enough, you know. Give us a whole network of sports. 
- [Announcer] There's just one place you need to go for all the names and games making sports news, ESPN Sports Center. 
- What happens in the 1980s is sports becomes a TV show and what are TV shows built around? They're built around characters. 
- You can't be serious, man? You cannot be serious. You guys are the absolutely pits of the world, you know that. 
- McEnroe, the perfect villain, the New Yorker that people loved to hate, or the cool Swede, never giving any emotion away. 
- What tennis really wants is to get its two best players playing over and over again in the final, whether they're John McEnroe and Bjorn Borg or Chris Evert and Martin Navratilova, that's what we wanna tune into over and over and over. 
- [Announcer] Oh goodness me, midcourt, and three match points to Martina Navratilova. 
- Know that this man has a smile that lights up a television screen from here to Bangor Maine. 
- And then there's Magic Johnson, this urban kid from Michigan and Larry Bird, this guy who worked carrying trash, one plays for the Los Angeles Lakers, the other plays for the Boston Celtics. It's a great story. 
- [Announcer] Lakers have several chances and here's Larry Bird, chugging down the court. 
- [Announcer] Magic Johnson leads the attack. Look at that pass, oh ho, what a show. 
- What a great play! 
- When those championship games are in primetime and people are paying attention to that, television feeds into those rivalries and makes them bigger than they've ever been before. 
- I dare them to challenge me with their somewhat primitive skills. THey're just as good as dead. 
- Every Mike Tyson fight was an event because every fight was like an ax murder. When he fought Michael Spinks, the electricity you could just feel watching it on TV. 
- [Announcer] Here comes Mike's hit, he leads with the right hand, there he goes! 
- Tyson was made for TV because there was drama. 
- [Announcer] It's all over. Mike Tyson has won it. 
- [Roy] Not a lot of junior high school kids can dunk, especially at five feet. 
- But everybody tries, man. 
- (laughing) I bet, now. 
- Everybody tries. 
- I think that he is starting to transcend just his sport, that he's becoming something of a public figure. 
- Michael Jordan becomes the model that every other athlete wants to shoot for. They wanna be a brand and that's what television does for these athletes, turns them into worldwide, iconic brands. 
- [Announcer] The in bounce pass comes in to Jordan. Here's Michael on the foul line. A shot on Ehlo, good! The Bulls win it! 
- Athletes, in the 80s, became part of an ongoing group of people that we cared about. We just had an enormous, pent-up demand for sports, and the 80s began to provide, thank goodness. 
- Cable television is continuing to grow. It's estimated that it will go into one million more US households this year. 
- With cable television suddenly offering an array of different channel choices, the audience bifurcated. That's an earthquake. 
- [All] I want my MTV. 
- I want my MTV. 
- I want my MTV. 
- A new concept is born, the best of TV combined with the best of radio. This is it, welcome to MTV, Music Television, the world's first 24 hour stereo video music channel. 
- Music television, what a concept. MTV was pow, in your face. You were not gonna turn us off. 
- MTV did nothing but play current music videos all day long. So let me get this strait. You turn on the TV and it's like the radio? 
- I'm Martha Quinn. The music will continue non-stop on MTV Music Television, the newest component of your stereo system. When MTV launched, a generation was launched. 18 to 24 year olds were saying, I want my MTV, I want my MTV videos, I want my MTV fashion. 
- Yo. 
- MTV was the first network really focused on the youth market and becomes hugely influential because they understand each other, the audience and the network. 
- MTV had a giant impact, visually and musically on every part of the TV culture that came next. 
- Freeze! 
- Freeze, Miami Vice! 
- Friday nights on NBC are different this season, thanks to Miami Vice. It's a show with an old theme, but a lot of new twists. Described by one critic as containing flashes of brilliance, nonetheless, shot entirely on location in South Miami, the story centers around two undercover vice cops. 
- I don't know how this is gonna work, Tubbs. I mean, you're not exactly up my alley, style and persona wise. Heaven knows I'm no box of candy. 
- Television very much was the small screen. What was interesting about Tony Yerkovich's pilot screenplay for Miami Vice is that it was exactly not that. Very much the approach was, okay, they call this a television series, but we're gonna make one-hour movies every single week. 
- [Male Voiceover] Okay, here we go. Stand by. 
- And action. 
- Police, police! 
- [Jane] They were just describing the show was sort of a new wave cop show. 
- Yeah, it's a cop show for the 80s. We use a lot of MTV images and rock music to help describe the mood and feeling of our show. 
- In a lot of ways, you don't get Miami Vice without MTV, because in a lot of ways, Miami Vice was a long video. The music was such a big part of that show. 
- There was an allure to using great music that everybody was listening to as opposed to the routine kind of TV scoring of that period. [Music] I can feel it coming in the air tonight [Music] 
- Not only was it not afraid to let long scenes play out, it would drag; a car going from point A to point B could be a four-minute Phil Collins song. And it was. [Music] Oh Lord [Music] 
- Being able to take a television series like Miami Vice and let's really kind of rock and roll with this until somebody says, stop, are you guys crazy, you can't do that, and nobody ever did. 
- Freeze, police!

- [Announcer] If you have moderate to severe psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis, little things can be a big deal. That's why there's Otezla. Otezla is not an injection or a cream. It's a pill that treats differently. For psoriasis, 75% clearer skin is achievable with reduced redness, thickness, and scaliness of plaques. For psoriatic arthritis, Otezla is proven to reduce joint swelling, tenderness and pain. And the Otezla prescribing information has no requirement for routine lab monitoring. Don't use if you're allergic to Otezla. It may cause severe diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting. Otezla is associated with an increased risk of depression. Tell your doctor if you have a history of depression or suicidal thoughts or if these feelings develop. Some people taking Otezla reported weight loss. Your doctor should monitor your weight and may stop treatment. Upper respiratory tract infection and headache may occur. Tell your doctor about your medicines and if you're pregnant or planning to be. Ready to treat differently with a pill? Otezla, show more of you.

- In recent years, it seems that television has become a kind of electronic confessional where guests are willing to expose painful and sometimes embarrassing aspects of their lives, quite readily, to millions of viewers. 
- At the beginning of the decade, we get the dominance of Phil Donahue and that sort of a maturation of women's issues and he seemed to talk to them in the audience, he seemed to talk to them through the TV screen. 
- I'm glad you called; kiss the kids. We'll be back in just a moment. 
- If you look at the body of work we've had, you're gonna see the 80s there. 
- I'm not here to say you're wrong, but let's understand this. When you bring a moral judgment without knowing them, against them, for the way that they look, they feel that confirms the reason for their rebellion, if that's what you wanna call it. 
- He really believed that daytime television needed to talk about the ideas we were thinking about, the issues we were concerned about. 
- I don't wanna characterize his question, but why don't you get this fixed instead of doing this screwy stuff? 
- There's not a single recorded case in history of any trans-sexual that ever, through psychological treatment, changed. It has never happened yet. 
- And we were putting very important people on the program, all kinds of people, gay people, people going to jail, people running for office, sometimes the same people. It was a magic carpet ride. You really do paint a very, very grim picture of the sitting president of the United States. 
- Let me just say this, I think he's probably the laziest president that I've ever seen. 
- The audience for Phil Donahue built and built and built and built and led the way to Oprah. 
- Wooh! Hello everybody! Hello! 
- Oprah has a particularly magical combination of her own background, her own experience, her own incisive mind, an empathetic spirit. 
- Thank you, I'm Oprah Winfrey and welcome to the very first national Oprah Winfrey show. 
- I was surprised at the rocket pace that Oprah took off, because it took us a lot longer. The Donahue Show rearranged the furniture, but Oprah remodeled the whole house. 
- There are a lot of other people out there who are watching who really don't understand what you mean when you say, well, we're in love, because I remember questioning my gay friends, saying, You mean like, you feel about him, the way I feel about-
- 
- It's kind of a strange concept for a lot of people to accept. 
- Oprah was connecting with people in a way that no one had on TV before. And it was really special to see. 
- Did you know that for the longest time I wanted to be a fourth grade teacher because of you? 
- I was not aware of inspiring anyone. 
- I think you did exactly what teachers are supposed to do. They create a spark for learning and that's the reason I have a talk show today. 
- Oprah Winfrey now dominates the talk show circuit both in the ratings and popularity. 
- I want to use my life as a source of lifting people up, that's what I wanna do. That's what I do every day on my show. We get accused of being tabloid television and sensational and so forth, but what I really think we do, more than anything else, is we serve as a voice to a lot of people who felt up until, perhaps, my show or some of the others, they were alone. This is what 67 pounds of fat looks like. I can't lift it. It is amazing to me that I can't lift it but I used to carry it around every day. 
- There's nothing more endearing to an audience than to have that kind of honesty and humility and courage on the part of a host. And that, I think, has a lot to do with her power. 
- Feels like I can do some good here and I really do think that the show does a lot of good. 
- American television is drowning in talk shows, but it's never seen anything like Morton Downey, Jr. 
- I wanna tell you this-
- 
- Sit down and shut up! 
- Other competitors come and take the television talk show into two different directions. So you start seeing the phenomenon of daytime television shows becoming less tame and more wild. 
- The 80s brought a lot of belligerence to television, whether it was Morton Downey, Jr. being the offensive characturish person that he was or Geraldo. He did his own outlandish things. 
- Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen. We're gonna get into the mind of another all-American boy who came under the influence of Satanism and took part in a crime without passion or motive. 
- Geraldo Rivera takes the power of the talk show to a whole other level, trying to put people on stage who hate each other, who are gonna fight. 
- In the case of the temple of Satan and the church of Satan, we have not had any problems with criminal behavior. 
- Yet, when you hear story after story after story of people committing these wretched crimes, these violent crimes in the devil's name-
- 
- The more tension there is, the more conflict there is, the more violence there is, the more the ratings go up. And the American people love to complain about it, but they also love to watch. 
- Geraldo Rivera is back in a controversy tonight. Rivera drew sharp criticism with his recent television special on devil worship, but today, he found himself in a real free for all. 
- I get sick and tired of seeing Uncle Tom here, trying to be a white man-
- 
- Go ahead, Troy, go ahead. 
- Now-
- 
- Sit down, guy. 
- Hey, hold it, hold it. 
- Sit down, sit down. 
- [Tom] Rivera suffered a broken nose, but he said the show will be broadcast later this month in its entirety. 
- That's not something I would have done, but there was a lot of hypocrisy. And one of the major magazines put the picture of Geraldo getting hit with a chair on the cover and the article said, isn't this awful, look what's happened to television. And yet, they couldn't wait to use it to sell their own magazine. 
- Let's go to the audience, all right? I want to stick to you guys, you guys-
- 
- Over the years, broadcasting has deteriorated and now, in this era of deregulation, it's deteriorating further. 
- Give people light and they will find their own way. Relax; America will survive the talk shows.

- Nah, man, that was my choice. This thing's got reclining seats, DVD player, it's got a built-in vacuum cleaner. You ever seen my kid eat crackers? 
- Yeah.

- Can't go wrong. 
- Can't get eaten.

- I was so anxious to do one line from the script, You complete me, there were times that I thought, is this too cheesy and I told Tom that. And he said, Just give me a shot at it. 
- You complete me. 
- I look around, everybody's crying. Grissled guys holding cable are like (sniffing), I was like, I think it's gonna work. (laughing)

- [Announcer] CNN Special Report, The Hidden Workforce, Undocumented In America, Friday at 10. 
- [Kevin Voiceover] 1968, the summer before junior high school, and I don't mind saying I was a pretty fair, little athlete. 
- The Wonder Years was a guy, in modern times, looking back on his childhood. That, in itself, is not new, but The Wonder Years did it with a wit and with the music. It was a brilliantly written show and a great performance by that entire young cast. 
- Hey, Steve. It looks like my baby brother and his girlfriend have found each other. 
- She's not my girlfriend. 
- Kevin Arnold has to cope with all the timeless problems of growing up during one of the most turbulent times that we have known. 
- Kevin Arnold is just like a regular kid, except in the 1960s and he's not really aware of many of the events. In one of the episodes, the whole family's watching the Apollo 8 take off, but I'm just sitting there trying to call a girl. 
- The first episode of The Wonder Years, anybody who saw it, remembers the ending where, you know, the first kiss with Winnie and Kevin Arnold. The song that they play is When A Man Loves A Woman. That moment seemed so pure and so real. [Music] When a man loves a woman [Music] [Music] Can't keep his mind on nothin' else [Music] 
- The tone of the baby boomers of the 1960s is about rebellion, about being students. By the 1980s, it's time to grow up, and so, they shave their beards, give up their dashikis, and they put on power suits, a whole new notion. 
- Aw, the yuppies. Last year, the politicians were all talking about winning their votes. Now those young, urban professionals and the rest of their baby boom generation are being wooed by advertisers and their agencies. 
- By the 80s, it was pretty clear that the generation after the generation of the 60s may be embodied by Alex Keaton on Family Ties, seemed to be a lot more interested in the corner office than the new Jerusalem. 
- You're a young man. You shouldn't be worried about success. You should be thinking about hopping on a tramp steamer and going around the world. 
- The 60s are over, Dad. 
- Thanks for the tip. 
- You weren't laughing at Michael J. Fox's character for being too conservative. You were actually laughing at the parents for being too hopelessly liberal. 
- What is this? I found it in the shower. 
- That's generic brand shampoo. 
- Ah! 
- This is him, this is the guy I've been telling ya about. This is everything you'd want in a president. 
- The genius of Family Ties is it allows a kind of youthful Regeanite to emerge that's focused more on the future, that's focused more on a critique of the 60s. 
- Michael J. Fox as Alex Keaton really became the center of the show and the writers were smart enough to see that they had something special and they wrote to that. 
- It's not fair, Alex. 
- Yeah, there's nothin' you can do about it, Jen. My advice to you is that you just enjoy being a child for as long as you can. I know I did. It was the best two weeks of my life. 
- Alex is a little Bill Buckley. The Wall Street Journal is his Bible. He has a tie to go with his pajamas. He's very conservative and very intense 17-year old. The first thing your teacher's gonna ask is what you did over the summer. Now, a lot of kids are gonna say, I went to the zoo, or I went to the beach, or I went to a baseball game. What are you gonna say? 
- I watched the Iran Contra hearings. 
- [Barry] If mom and dad thought his generation was going to the dogs, think again. This is the generation that has discovered hard work and success. 
- American culture is changing in the 80s and in terms of television, there's a whole notion of Demographic segmentation. 
- Networks were beginning to not be afraid to appeal to a very specific demographic. 
- Hey handsome. Look at that shirt. Is that a power shirt, or what? 
- Nice suit, Ellyn, good shoulder pads. You look like you're drafted by the Eagles. 
- Ooh, hoo. 
- Thirtysomethign said, we're not gonna have cops, lawyers or doctors. We're just gonna be about people. 
- What are we doing here? Why did we start this business? 
- To do our thing, but right now, we got two wives, three kids, four cars, two mortgages, a payroll, and that's life, pal. You be the breadwinner now. 
- Is that what I am? 
- Thirtysomething is a very important show as you're going into this era of television being more introspective and more emotional and some people weren't buying it. But for other people, when they were talking about things like having kids and who was gonna go back to work and some of these issues that hadn't been talked about a whole lot, it was important to people. 
- I was so looking forward, I was so looking forward to doing this, to being a grown-up for just an hour. 
- In the beginning, there was talk of this being the yuppie show and you mentioned it tonight. You said that if there were a category for the most annoying show, this might win as well. 
- No, what some people perceive as annoying, it has nothing to do with yuppie. I think yuppie is a word made up by demographers and advertisers to sell soap. I don't think it has anything to do with what the show is. 
- Thirtysomething was not a giant hit, but it was a niche hit. It attracted an enormously upscale group of advertisers. 
- The network cared who was watching, not how many were watching, and that was more and more catching on in the 80s. 
- The prosecution will ask you that you look to the law and this you must do, but I ask of you that you look to your hearts as well. Thank you. 
- LA Law was partly a classic lawyer show. But it was intertwined with their personal lives and different lawyers who were sleeping together and trying to get ahead. 
- The reality level on that show was like a foot or two off the ground. And you were willing to go with that because it was a whole new spin on a law show. 
- Uh-uh, tell the truth. If you had to do it all over again, and she walked into your office and she said, Take my case, would you? 
- Well-
- 
- Of course you would because it is juicy, newsy, exciting stuff. 
- It was really fun to take the Hill Street Blues format and use it to frame an entirely different social and cultural strata with vastly different results. 
- I wonder if I might engage with my client privately? 
- Certainly. 
- What are you doing for dinner tonight? 
- I was planning on having you. 
- Okay, skip lunch. 
- The formula had gotten established of how you can do a dramatic show and yet, still have an awful lot of fun. We didn't used to be able to accept that very easily in a TV hour and even before the 80s are out, it's like, oh, okay, I get it. So it's like, all right, what are the rules now? 
- You say you're part of a change that's going on. Where is it coming from and where's it going? 
- I think it has to do with networks being more willing to put creative control in the hands of producers, who have strong view points and letting them do what they wanna do. 
- I think what Hill Street Blues was and what Moonlighting was is what the best television is, is it distinguishes itself by its voice. 
- What we're supposed to be here is the one thing people can trust. If you go out there like a bunch of night riders, what the hell are you but just another vicious street gang? 
- There was great writing in the 80s. That was a core group of brilliant people. 
- The audience's demands were changing. 
- It's obvious television has changed a lot since the first Emmy was awarded 35 years ago. 
- It's as though the contemporary audience was yearning for more stories about themselves. 
- Bye everybody out there on TV, bye. 
- As the 80s came to an end, everything changed. 
- I think one of the, when we look back at the 1980s, 10 and 20 years from now, we're gonna be disgusted at some of the TV that you've just mentioned, the super violent programs, the terrible comedy shows, but one of the great things that's happening now and will continue to happen increasingly, throughout this decade, is the replacement of rotten entertainment programming by news and talk and information programming on all three networks, very slowly. 
- But will it be rotten news and uh-
- 
- Well, I don't think, so far, most of the news oriented programs, magazines, information, talk shows, and the networks, have been surprisingly, at least to me, surprisingly good.
