- [Announcer] A UK Channel, a new season of Midsomer Murders, then it was North America's first school for secret agents, Camp X, followed by an all new Bletchley Circle. British Television at its best. 
- [Narrator] The '80s. A time of differing memories. 
- The '80s were the time of my life. 
- You're just survivin' in this state, like complete nothingness. 
- [Narrator] Divergent music. 
- We just did anything and everything. We were just crazy. 
- All right! 
- If you can't move to go-go, you weren't meant to move. 
- Come on! 
- [Narrator] Development. 
- Washington was emerging as the great cosmopolitan world capital. 
- [Narrator] Defending championships. 
- From Riggins, good hold! 
- I went from being pretty smart to the next day a buffoon. 
- [Narrator] And death. 
- We'd have shootings, but you'd have overdose deaths. 
- I personally had a huge number of friends that I lost. 
- [Narrator] And a mayor who defined the city. 
- That little white powder is so powerful. 
- He was the sun around which we all orbited. 
- [Narrator] Join us as we travel back in time to Washington in the '80s. 
- [Narrator] Washington at the beginning of the '80s, still rebuilding after the '68 riots. 
- I think the residents were feeling hopeful. We had a new mayor. I think there was a good feeling. We were all just coming off of the Civil Rights era, and so the community was building and coexisting. 
- We'd just had home rule for a few years, and it just sounded like everything was gonna be great. Of course, it wasn't. 
- [Narrator] Washington, D.C. was still a city divided. 
- One black city and one white city. One city in poverty, and one city doing well. 
- [Narrator] Middle class white flight meant the 172,000 white residents who remained tended to be above average income, and live in the city's leafier Northwest suburbs. 
- And where the white wards, that were quote-unquote, received anything they want, and there was the other wards, the forgotten wards, that were out there hanging out. 
- [Narrator] African-Americans, who made up 70% of the city's residents, tended to live and work in the poorer eastern quadrants of the city, and close to downtown. [Music] This town [Music] [Music] It's coming like a ghost town [Music] 
- When you drove downtown with your parents, who made sure the doors were locked. You know, everything was boarded up, downtown was a lot of crime, it was a scary place. 
- There was some hope that that would change, but there was nothing yet that gave an indication that change was really coming. 
- [Narrator] The Federal City's most prominent resident found himself in a similar state of stagnation. 
- It is a crisis of confidence. 
- Four hostages had been taken in Iran, we had 21% interest rates, 13% inflation. 
- Washington was, as it is now, a predominantly Democratic town, so Washington wanted this President to succeed. 
- [Narrator] The rest of America did not feel the same. 
- NBC News now makes its projection, Reagan is our projected winner. [Music] Another one bites the dust [Music] [Music] Another one bites the dust [Music] [Music] And another one down [Music] [Music] And another one down [Music] 
- I, Ronald Reagan, do solemnly swear, that I will faithfully execute the office of Presi-
- 
- [Narrator] Two months later, just as Republican Ronald Reagan took the Oath of Office, Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran released all 52 hostages. 
- I am convinced they suspected that Ronald Reagan would give them 48 hours, and if the hostages weren't on the way home, there would be military action. 
- [Narrator] Though Washingtonians were excited to welcome the hostages, most didn't the feel the same about the new President. 
- Depressed would be a good way of describing the fact that Ronald Reagan was bringing with him a whole new political culture. 
- [Man] There were fur coats all over the place. There was a perception that the California conservatives who came were a pretty rich crowd, and not very much in touch with the average folks. 
- I think that the gay community at that time had an understandable amount of trepidation. You know, what was this President gonna be like? 
- I gave Reagan all the attention he deserved. He was not the friend of the city. 
- [Narrator] Others were more welcoming. 
- From the election, there were one-word difference between president and resident, and he wanted to bridge the gap between resident and president, and I believe that, and I appreciate that, because I'm the mayor of the city, and he's gonna be one of my constituents. 
- I think he knew more about how Washington functioned than a lot of other presidents. He was the only president that I've known who actually invited the local media to meet with him. 
- When Reagan came to town, that arts beat and entertainment beat just exploded, because Reagan brought all of his showbiz connections to town. They had his first inauguration, they had this huge event. And Reagan set the tone for movies and show business in Washington. 
- Washington was emerging as the great cosmopolitan world capital it is today. It was a great time in America and it was a great time for the Reaganauts. 
- [Narrator] Until March 30th, 1981. As Reagan was leaving the Washington Hilton, John Hinckley, Jr. fired six times. 
- Get up! One shot hit press secretary James Brady critically wounding him. Another ricocheted off the presidential limousine lodging in Reagan's lung. 
- [Reporter] What are you gonna do when you get home? 
- Sit down. (laughing) 
- [Narrator] Within a month, Reagan was back at work. And the Washington Hilton had a nickname. 
- Meet me over there by the Hilton. Oh, the Hinckley Hilton. 
- The Hinckley Hilton. I don't think I've ever driven by that hotel without thinking about it. 
- [Narrator] Back at his desk, the president worked with his administration to fulfill his campaign promise to cut spending. Growing discontent with existing treatments prompted cuts in mental health services. 
- You began to see large numbers of panhandlers appearing on the streets of Washington. 
- Bein' D.C. where the president reside, he was thinkin' we shouldn't have some places like this. 
- I walk the streets, and I sleep on the goddamn streets. 
- [Narrator] Many district homeless were veterans damaged by their experiences in Vietnam, fighting an unpopular war. [Music] I want to know what love is [Music] [Music] I want you to show me [Music] 
- Didn't even have to go. I wanted to go. Everything I put my heart into, you come back and you got dumped now. [Music] Now you can show me [Music] 
- [Narrator] In 1980, Congress authorized construction of a Vietnam memorial on the Mall. Following a nationwide competition, the design for a sunken reflective black granite wall by Maya Lin, a 21-year-old college student, was selected. 
- It was so simple and so direct that it was incredible. 
- [Narrator] But not everyone was happy with the design. 
- I said this doesn't look like something honoring these people's service and there was a tremendous cultural artistic debate that went on in this town and a lot of people felt are they dishonoring the vets by doing this? 
- [Narrator] Eventually the design for the memorial was amended and three soldiers were added, but on its opening in 1982, the strength of the original design became evident. 
- I'm here to pay eulogy and homage to all of my comrades didn't make it back with me. 
- I think they wanted something more heroic but I think they got something that was even more profound. 
- I think what turned it around was not the black walls, it's the names on the walls. And I will say it turned out from the way that thing's been received that I was wrong on that one. Wrong, big time. 
- And I love the American people for being here and just saying thank you, because that's all we want, is to hear that. 
- [Narrator] For more than a century, the city had supported two nationally recognized daily newspapers, the more progressive Washington Post and more conservative Washington Star. But the recession and shrinking demand for evening dailies forced the Star into bankruptcy in 1981. 
- TV killed 'em. People who watch the TV news go home, they don't sit there and read their paper. Click. (background chattering) 
- For about a year and a half, we were a one-paper town, and that was, I felt, a little dangerous. 
- [Narrator] But in a sign of the growing clout of conservative voices, an upstart daily with an unwavering point of view hit the newsstands in 1982. 
- [Reporter] It's called The Washington Times and it's owned by the publishing arm of the Reverend Moon's Unification church. 
- I wasn't excited to see the moonie paper come around, no. Reverend Moon was a great Christian evangelist from Korea. He obviously felt that it would be nice to have a good mouthpiece in Washington. 
- My column used to appear in The Washington Times on a regular, you know, twice a week, and every conservative read it. I mean, it was something we had that we'd never had before. 
- [Narrator] No one who worked the newsrooms of Washington of the '80s can forget January 13th, 1982. 
- I had just come across the bridge in a blinding snowstorm and when I got 10 feet off the bridge we heard a crunch. 
- [Narrator] At 4:01 p.m., Air Florida Flight 90 crashed into the 14th Street bridge. 
- We get down there and we don't really have a method for dealing with that kind of mass casualty. The radio systems didn't function like they should, we didn't have any place to deal with the bodies. 
- [Narrator] Passerby Lenny Skutnik dove into the water to help save a drowning woman. 
- [Reporter] We have just learned that that woman fighting to survive in the icy Potomac was one of the stewardesses on board the plane, her name Kelly Dunman. 
- He really symbolized I think for a lot of people here that people wanted to help and were willing to help each other. 
- [Narrator] 74 people on the plane and four on the bridge were killed. 
- One of my dearest friends was on that plane. She was the mother of three young children. I miss her to this day. 
- [Narrator] As word of the crash spread and the Washington Press corps descended on the scene, it became clear that another tragedy had struck the region. 
- Reporters couldn't get there because the Metro train also had derailed. 
- [Narrator] 30 minutes after the plane crash an Orange Line train jumped the tracks in a tunnel, near Federal Triangle. 
- [Reporter] Two women and a man whose names have not been released were killed. 
- That forced the region to think oh my goodness, what do we do if? 
- So for some many of our-
- 
- [Narrator] By 1982, Barry's first term as mayor was coming to a close. For the first time since his election in 1978, voters were given the chance to judge his record. 
- He was elected by whites. As he won essentially with the votes of people in wards one, three, two, and six. 
- And this is just the beginning of what we're going to do here. 
- [Narrator] But once in power, Barry knew that tying his political future to the city's white residents was unsustainable. 
- He made an incredibly prudent political decision to switch his base to black, through minority contracting programs and bringing black folks into key positions in the government. 
- I can remember him saying, Listen. You're gonna be able to advance, you got to get prepared for leadership, and for somebody like me, I got to be chief because of Barry. 
- [Narrator] Barry used the power of his position to encourage the creation and development of African American owned businesses. [Music] We found the proper place [Music] 
- And if you're gonna do business in D.C., one of the first questions they'd ask you, do you have minority participation in this deal? What came about was a philosophy that white business should partner up with qualified African American business people and once you get a black city council all of a sudden the white law firms start saying we're gonna have black partners, and some of the white businesses start saying we have to have black lobbyists. 
- [Narrator] The increased flow of money moving through the city's economy swelled the district's coffers, giving Barry the income to spend on projects that benefited the city's poorer youth and build a base for the rest of his political career. 
- My most memorable program is the summer job program. Over a hundred thousand young people went through our summer job program. 
- I was just at some event and the guy who was in charge of the people parking the cars came up to me, he says, I got my first job in the Marion Barry summer job program. He said, Now I help to run this company. 
- That was the bomb. You go down 500 C Street and there's a long line of kids waitin' in line to get their checks, you know. You would see them all downtown at The Go-Go at night. (laughing) So, that was awesome, yes indeed. 
- [Narrator] Recognizing that the district's aging were underserved, Barry also invested heavily in services for the elderly. 
- And the flip side of that for Barry was in addition to that being a good thing, was that he would take buses, recreation buses, and take them all down to vote. 
- [Narrator] In 1982, Barry was elected to a second term as mayor, with 81% of the vote. 
- I want to thank all of you for reaffirming your faith in me. 
- It was clear that his success in the election had been largely through black folks and not from the white community. He said get over it. 
- [Narrator] During his first term, Barry had honored promises made to the gay community, a core constituency that helped to elect him. 
- [Man] He understood that we were a political power. 
- Just his willingness to say I will have openly gay people in my administration. Nobody did that at that time, so that was huge. 
- [Narrator] Barry's actions helped to establish D.C. as one of the country's most gay-friendly cities. 
- It affected most gay people's social lives in that they became more open. 
- [Woman] It gave the community this enormous number of healthy, happy ways of meeting people and so it made it a lot easier for people to come out. 
- [Narrator] By 1984, expansion of D.C.'s annual gay pride day to a week-long festival was complete, cementing Washington's status as home to one of the country's largest and most vibrant gay communities. Improvement in the city's fortunes also spread to the football field. In 1981, team owner Jack Kent Cooke fired coach Jack Pardee and replaced him with San Diego offensive coordinator, Joe Gibbs. 
- At first I said if I'm not successful hey, that's part of life, but when I got there what I realized is just how many people depend on you. 
- [Narrator] The team began the season 0-5. 
- I thought I was gonna be first guy to ever coach in the NFL and never win a game, tell Pat please sell the dog, I'd hate to come home and see that fella draped over the steps. (laughing) 
- [Narrator] But a third of the way through the '81 season, wins replaced losses, and the team finished 8-8. 
- They had a really unique squad. Theismann was just really slick. 
- Hit. 
- Joe T. was probably one of the most passionate football players, I mean that guy wanted to be successful. 
- [Man] Riggins was a bull. I mean you had Joe Washington who was just this small, speedy guy. Art Monk, anything you threw up, he caught. 
- Their hearts were big and fat, and they put a lot of meat against that line. 
- [Crowd] We want Grant! We want Grant! We want Grant! 
- [Narrator] After going 8-1 and first in the NFC East in the strike-shortened 1982 season, they hosted the NFC championship game against their fiercest rival. 
- The excitement at RFK you heard outside the stadium, just up in the neighborhood you'd just hear that roaring crowd. 
- [Narrator] The home team was leading 24-17 with less than seven minutes remaining. 
- [Announcer] Play action fake to Dorsett, screen path, batted in the air by Lanley. Darryl Grant's there picks it off. Touchdown, Washington Redskins. Unbelievable! 
- [Man] The stadium was rocked. It was thunderous. 
- [Announcer] I do not believe it! 
- [Narrator] With that win, the team headed to Pasadena to play the Miami Dolphins in Superbowl XVII. The game was close throughout. 
- It came down to the 4th quarter, I think we were on the plus 41 yard line, and it was 4th and one, and I made a call to go for it. 
- [Announcer] There goes (drowned out by music). Their touchdown surprised them. Hand to Riggins. He's got a good hold, he's got the first down for 40. He's gone! The 35, the 30, the 20, he's gone! He's gone! Touchdown, Washington Redskins. Holy cow, was that a play or what! 
- [Narrator] The final score, 27-17, Washington. 
- Redskins are number one! 
- Everybody poured into the streets of M Street in Georgetown. It was euphoric. The city's team finally brought home the bacon. [Music] Pump pump pump pump me up [Music] 
- [Narrator] Football wasn't the only thing making fans at RFK cheer. 
- The Back To School Boogie, the battle of the bands, you'd get an opportunity to see all these go-go bands perform inside of a huge stadium. [Music] Come out here with family [Music] 
- And I used to always say if you can't move to go-go, you weren't meant to move. 
- I remember first time hearing Trouble Funk, there's a song, Pump Me Up. [Music] Pump pump pump pump me up [Music] [Music] Like the man with the super S [Music] And Henry Rollins, he was my best friend, we heard it on the radio and we just pulled the car over to listen to the song. [Music] From the East to West [Music] 
- [Narrator] In addition to Chuck Brown and Trouble Funk, bands such as Rare Essence and E.U. created a music and culture proud of its D.C. roots. 
- Look what I brought to y'all, all right? 
- Go-go was a product of a time when D.C. public schools had more music programs. 
- Kids couldn't afford to buy instruments and so the kids would check out their instruments and they'd go home to practice all right, but with the local go-go band. 
- [Narrator] Live recordings, better known as PA tapes, became a form of currency for go-go fans. 
- We used to go to the go-gos with our big boom boxes and stand in front of the speakers. 
- It was and still is a big thing to get your name called out, especially if your name is always heard on the PA tapes, you know. 
- Woo, that was a big feeling and so you wanted that PA tape from this date. 
- [Narrator] The City's insatiable appetite for live go-go led to performances springing up all over town. 
- Everybody represented where they came from. Junk Yard from Barry Farm, Pat Worth named himself after the area. 
- My first ever experience playing live with a go-go band was in my friend's backyard and people would crowd around and listen to us. 
- [Narrator] A compulsion to play live music that lead to an unlikely sharing of stages. 
- A lot of the regular clubs like The Bayou and Desperados only booked big rock bands or big-named people, so we would play anywhere and it would end up that we would play together. (Should I Stay or Should I Go by The Clash) 
- [Narrator] One of these crossover venues was at 930 F Street, Northwest. 
- Their slogan was a place and a time. 
- [Narrator] When original owners Dody DiSanto and Jon Bowers opened The 930 Club in 1980, their choice of location in the heart of downtown was unconventional. 
- [Man] When the 930 was there, there were peep shows and you know, liquor stores and strip joints. People couldn't afford to buy expensive real estate so they had to do it in the bad parts of town. 
- [Narrator] The tiny odd-shaped space was an acquired taste. 
- There was really not much room for the audience. It was like you were in a lobby. We would have bands show up who were appalled and ask-
- [Music] Should I stay or should I go [Music] So where's the club? And some bands walked out. DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, Will Smith, walked out, two sold-out shows. Course when the band did go on, you were right in front of them. There was no closer experience to see a show than the old 930 club. 
- [Narrator] A unique venue that became a favorite of the local hardcore punk scene, defined by its inclusion of anyone who didn't feel they belonged. 
- If you grew up in this town I think you feel really marginalized from one reason or another. 
- [Narrator] D.C. punk gave birth to bands like Government Issue, State of Alert, and Minor Threat with Ian MacKaye on lead vocals. 
- We identify as Washington D.C. It was a chip on our shoulder. 
- [Narrator] The region also produced the groundbreaking Bad Brains. 
- Bad Brains were four guys from Anacostia in PG County and they were just an incredible band. 
- Yeah! [Music] They're playing basketball [Music] [Music] We love that basket [Music] [Narrator] The early '80s saw an explosion of the popularity of Georgetown University basketball. [Music] Playing basketball [Music] 
- I can remember when Georgetown was just a type of ivy league Jesuit school but then John Thompson came and turned it around and everyone was Hoyas, Hoyas, Hoyas. [Music] Playing basketball [Music] 
- [Narrator] The team's tough defense-minded style helped to attract a strong, loyal following. 
- A predominantly black basketball team at a really good university, that inspired a lot of us. We hung out in Georgetown, we wore Georgetown University sweatshirts. 
- It was like a party to me. It was the place to be, I mean. (laughing) The energy was all over the place. 
- [Narrator] In March of 1982, the Hoyas led by center Patrick Ewing advanced to the NCAA championship game. With less than 10 seconds left they had a chance to take the winning shot. 
- [Announcer] Fred Brown with the ball, oh, throws it to the wrong guy. 
- [Man] I had to turn the TV off. I couldn't stand to watch anymore. 
- [Narrator] Two seasons later, the team went 34-3, winning the big east championship. [Music] They're playing basketball [Music] 
- [Narrator] They advanced through the NCAA regional, the final four, to the championship game against Houston. [Music] Basketball [Music] 
- Michael Graham just goes up and tomahawk dunks it, and he looks at Pat and he just points at him just to let him know okay, we got this. 
- [Announcer] Georgetown wins the title, and Fred Brown gets the hug. [Music] To the, to the hoop [Music] 
- [Narrator] The Hoyas were welcomed back to Washington as champions, and Coach Thompson as a hero. 
- And I think all of us feel a great pride in what you've accomplished. 
- [Narrator] As President Reagan campaigned for reelection in 1984, Mitch Snyder, the leader of homeless advocacy group, Community For Creative Non-Violence, or CCNV, staged a hunger strike to demand the administration renovate a shelter in an abandoned federal building. 
- The administration's saying in everybody's name, including ours, that it has no responsibility to people who are the poorest of the poor. 
- My sister-in-law, for a very brief time, was in HUD dealing with the homeless and she wanted to go and interview Mitch Snyder and essentially the administration said don't do it, and don't do anything. [Music] Needs to be loved, just like everybody else does [Music] 
- [Narrator] 51 days into his protest, Snyder got his wish. 
- I think we capitulated to some degree. Truth be told, Reagan's a sensitive, I mean something like that would affect him. 
- [Narrator] Two days later, President Ronald Reagan was reelected. 
- You ain't seen nothin' yet. 
- I had several friends that seemed to have this continual flu bug, and then it became pneumonia and then they just died. 
- [Narrator] As Reagan began his second term, a lack of action towards those suffering and dying from HIV infection persisted. 
- [Reporter] White House officials confirm that the president has never talked with his surgeon general about AIDS. 
- [Narrator] Those in the district turned to The Washington Blade for information. 
- The community desperately needed information about the disease. 
- [Narrator] On April 4th, 1983, the Whitman-Walker Clinic held D.C.'s first public forum on the epidemic. 
- Whitman Walker was one of the founding fathers of AIDS information. But they also helped house people, they helped to feed people. They had to actually step in and become involved in the link between the doctors and the hospitals and the patients because a lot of people were being turned away from hospitals. [Music] Can you tell me why [Music] [Music] Can you tell me why [Music] 
- [Narrator] But the deaths of two public figures with ties to Washington forced the country, and the president, to act. 
- Rock Hudson was familiar with the president himself and an individual who had one, particular, very influential friend in Washington. Elizabeth Taylor. Not only was she an icon of the movies, she was also married to a US senator from Virginia, John Warner. And so minds were changed and the perception began to shift. 
- That science will continue to find the critical answers. 
- Jerry Smith, my favorite tight end for the Washington Redskins, then he was stricken with AIDS, it became apparent that this He-Man was gay. 
- [Darian] Ronald Reagan's opinion definitely changed because these were your friends dying. Same thing happened to me. 
- [Crowd] Gay rights now! Gay rights now! 
- [Narrator] A year after Jerry Smith's passing, an estimated half million people descended on Washington with a second march for gay and lesbian rights. [Music] Every bond you break [Music] [Music] Every step you take I'll be watching you [Music] 
- [Narrator] The highlight, a massive memorial quilt covering the Mall with the names of the thousands of Americans who had died of AIDS. [Music] I'll be watching you [Music] 
- America is a quilt, made up of many patches, many pieces, many textures where everybody fits. 
- Everyone who was there just looked at each other and either cried or smiled or a combination of the two. [Music] I'll be watching you [Music] [Music] Every move you make [Music] [Music] Every vow you break [Music] [Music] Every smile you fake [Music] 
- [Narrator] By 1987, the decade's early promise was beginning to fade. [Music] We're on a road to nowhere [Music] [Music] Come on inside [Music] 
- [Narrator] Attempts to give the district congressional representation and statehood had gone nowhere. Many started to ask if Barry's management of the city was part of the problem. 
- Marion Barry was already starting to have some budget problems, running some deficits, but he didn't cut his crony contracts, he didn't cut waste fraud and abuse, what he cut was 1,500 police officers. 
- [Narrator] Mayor Barry's lifestyle also raised questions. 
- [Reporter] Karen Johnson just told authorities that she sold the mayor cocaine, 20 to 30 times, from late 1980 to 1982. 
- [Man] He was notorious for staying out late with women who were not his wife. This is when he would use the security detail to procure women for him. 
- Marion Barry tonight angrily denied that he has been hospitalized after overdosing on cocaine. 
- Marion Barry became too comfortable with power. After winning over the overwhelming majority of the African American population, he felt he could no longer be removed. 
- He was powerful, he could make a lot of things happen in your ward. Hey, do you want that new fire station? Do you want the library? 
- [Narrator] Growing discontent that led Barry to have real competition in the '86 mayoral election. 
- In Washington D.C., where the voter registration was 10 to one, Democrats to Republicans, I got a third of the vote. 
- [Narrator] Though Schwartz's tally exceeded everyone's expectations, Barry's base delivered him a third term, with 61% of the vote. 
- Washington Post endorsed him three straight times, I think with growing reluctance or something like that the third time. 
- [Narrator] But the electorate and opinion pages cooling on Barry did nothing to slow his larger than life persona. 
- When people elected me, they didn't elect me pope. They elected me mayor. I'd go out at night at nine o'clock or ten o'clock, what did that have to do with anything? [Music] And the beat goes on [Music] 
- Because of his short attention span and he could compartmentalize, he would go out at night with the famous, I'm a night owl, as if that would wash things away. 
- [Narrator] The city paper dubbed him Mayor For Life. 
- When you're for the people, the people know it. He's the only one I seen that stood there for us. 
- [Narrator] If he hadn't been mayor, Barry's nightlife would not have been surprising as D.C.'s bar and club scene reached a peak in the mid-80s. 
- There was this club called The Foxtrappe and it was the place to go for the buppies. 
- That was the quintessential place where high-income sophisticated people go. 
- You dress up to go there, you dressed up your behavior too and your manners, (chuckling) in most cases. 
- [Narrator] Because the Foxtrappe wasn't just a nightclub, it was a D.C. institution where members of the black congressional caucus rubbed shoulders with African American business leaders and celebrities. [Music] Tam bo li de say de moi ya [Music] [Music] Yeah, Jambo Jambo [Music] [Music] Way to party oh we goin' [Music] [Music] Oh, jambali [Music] 
- There was always an interesting event going on. A lot of them were fundraisers. A lot of them were what we would call networking events, and it was very important for young, black professionals to feel a sense of solidarity and to share their experiences. It was a great way to socialize and also to meet new people. 
- It was nice but, you know, it was an important step in the process. 
- [Narrator] D.C. super discos were also experiencing unparalleled popularity. 
- The Pier, the Lost and Found, the Other Side, it was a blast, a freakin' hoot. Insane. Redskins came in their Redskins jerseys. You'd run into extremely famous people and they all merged together. [Music] Oh, jamabli [Music] 
- [Narrator] A vibrant party scene that became synonymous with the '80s recreational drug of choice. 
- Everyone did cocaine. It was everywhere, and it was considered to be like a cocktail. You had a glass of gin, you had a line of coke. 
- [Narrator] But as participation was reliant on a certain lifestyle it was something many average Americans never experienced. 
- It was a subculture that I knew absolutely nothing about and it was brought to the forefront. 
- [Narrator] In 1984, sophomore Len Bias from Prince George's County led the University of Maryland to the Atlantic Coast Conference title bringing national attention to the team. Len Bias's senior season was highlighted by a win over the top-ranked Tar Heels. 
- [Announcer] Maryland has knocked off North Carolina in one of the biggest upsets this year and there is one happy Len Bias. 
- You couldn't stop him. He had the athleticism, he had the defense, he can rebound. 
- [Narrator] Skills that made him the second, overall pick in the 1986 NBA draft. 
- We were just so happy and it was just a wonderful, wonderful time. He comes back to Maryland and I'm not at home, and I never see him again. [Music] Tell all your friends they can go my way [Music] [Music] Pay your toll, sell your soul [Music] 
- Investigators this morning are trying to determine exactly what caused the death Thursday of former University of Maryland basketball star, Len Bias. 
- [Narrator] The autopsy showed that Bias had died from a cocaine overdose. 
- Like I said, there was a subculture that I knew nothing about until my son died and then boom, you find out this is real life. 
- I love you Leonard and I'll miss you. I'll see you in heaven one day. 
- [Narrator] As cocaine use was peaking in the Washington region, a new, more potent, smuggleable form of the drug began to appear. 
- The first time that we made a seizure of crack was up in Northwest and from then on it was on. [Music] Ah yeah [Music] 
- It seemed like suddenly, one day, we woke up and we were in the middle of a crack cocaine epidemic and this time it was the crews of kids who had grown up with my own kids who were on the corner selling crack cocaine battling over turf. [Music] France a skinny man died of a [Music] 
- One minute it felt like we were putting quarters into the Space Invaders machine to being a drug dealer. You had to survive so you join a gang just to avoid being suppressed by a gang. 
- [Narrator] While young African American men both profited and died during the crack epidemic, some of its most tragic victims were young women. 
- And I was much younger which I fancied myself a photographer and I had taken photos of young women in my neighborhood when they were seven, eight years old, the light in their eyes, the smiles of their faces, and to see those same young women prostituting herself on a corner in her own neighborhood where everybody knew her to buy crack cocaine. 
- [Narrator] Through it all, the city and police departments seemed powerless. 
- The Clean Sweep operation was designed to attack the crowds that were gathering to buy and sell drugs, and we just arrested people in the hundreds. [Music] Rocket ship explodes [Music] [Music] And everybody still wants to fly [Music] 
- I was one of the ones that they grabbed and threw down and they didn't take me straight to the precinct. They had to take me to D.C. General Hospital first because I was beaten up pretty badly. 
- There wasn't any study to say does this make sense? Is there any longterm impact? The courts were saying we can't process 700 people. We'd come in, make the arrest, in two weeks they're back, and they're doing the same thing. 
- [Officer] I got his chin. 
- It ain't mine. [Music] Time [Music] 
- [Narrator] While the headlines were dominated by bad news, the popularity and profitability of local TV and radio made it an exciting time for the business. 
- [Announcer] With Paul Berry. 
- It was the grand age of competition between local television stations and local radio stations. You could experiment, people were a little less safe. 
- [Narrator] Earlier in the decade, iconic radio station, D.C. 101 pushed the experimental envelope to its limits, hiring a young DJ named Howard Stern to host its morning show. 
- Everybody would come in that day and say did you hear what Howard Stern did or said this morning? 
- Does she douche with-
- 
- One time when his wife had a miscarriage, he did an entire show on it. 
- If somebody doesn't want to listen to my radio program they should turn the dial and listen to some other jerk. 
- [Narrator] While Howard Stern was the most shocking DJ in town, Donnie Simpson was undisputed favorite. 
- Every radio station wanted to figure out a way to attract young whites and young blacks and Donnie started mixing those two kinds of music that Donnie would say, I'm playing a fudge ripple. [Music] We all know [Music] [Music] That people are the same wherever you go [Music] 
- Donnie had the smile, he had the laugh, he had the bubbly eyes. 
- [Man] Great man, thanks. 
- [Narrator] Good looks and a personality made for a new national TV network. 
- Today, on video soul. 
- When we put Donnie on BET as the host of Video Soul-
- 
- I'm Donnie Simpson, can you join me tonight for Video Soul? That's tonight, Video Soul, 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time, right here on BET. 
- He became instantly, overnight, a celebrity and BET began to be defined by Donnie Simpson and Video Soul. 
- We'll be back, we got a second hour-
- 
- It was national and it so it allowed us to broaden our scope on who we were as a culture. 
- [Narrator] While cable TV was in its infancy, Washington's local affiliates were at their height. 
- Hey, you want depth? Watch channel 26. (laughing) This is channel 4, we have fun here. [Music] So good to turn to [Music] 
- [Announcer] Channel 5, Washington's most watched station. 
- [Broadcaster] From WJLA TV, Washington's-
- 
- [Narrator] As ratings for local news created advertising dollars, battle between sports departments became particularly fierce. 
- It turned into a golden time of competition between channel 9 and channel 4. George Michael had an open checkbook, George could cover anything he wanted. Glenn Brenner on the other hand, was probably the most talented, creative, hilarious character who ever worked in television news. 
- How are you doing, I mean, what's the chalk? 
- You got an over large-
- 
- Weenie? 
- Weenie on the street, sir. 
- My weenie's too big? 
- George and Glenn hated each other. They would go to the Superbowl, get the room number that the other guy was in and then walk into the bar and say hey, drinks on the house! 
- [Narrator] Most residents also remember a favorite news station. 
- My favorite was Channel 4. Jim Vance was just cool. He's just a smooth cat. He had a way of telling his stories without giving up the cool. 
- Channel 9 was held in a high regard as the number one news station to a lot of people because they covered the news stories without opinions raised in them. 
- Starting with his third term, there seemed to be a deterioration in the attention that Marion Barry paid to the city. 
- [Narrator] In January 1987, the city was shut down by a massive snowstorm. 
- [Darian] Everything stopped. I had actually hosted a large party the night before and we came stumbling out the door into six feet of snow. 
- [Narrator] The day before, Barry left town to attend the Superbowl in California. 
- It's no good, the guy, he don't clean the street. 
- [Narrator] While the mayor was in California, the region was hit with a bigger blizzard but Barry stuck to his plans, reportedly partying so hard he was taken to the hospital. Barry returned to D.C. the next day. 
- It's unfortunate that so much snow fell, which we certainly aren't responsible for. 
- [Narrator] Barry's lack of attention was especially problematic, as crack-related violence threatened to overrun the city. 
- The strange thing about it, he never would tell you to do anything except lock up the drug dealers. 
- Outside of the killings, one of the lowest crime rates in the country. 
- [Narrator] At the same time the district's youth were dragged into the epidemic, the city cut funding for recreational services, leaving go-gos one of the few places to meet and gather. 
- One element of go-go is call and response. It's very easy for a lead talker to ask a crowd is Southeast better than Northeast, and so there's this automatic tribalism. A few go-go bands would sort of advertise PCP. Tell me now, what y'all smoke? And the people would respond Love Boat. 
- And you get a whole bunch of kids together just to dance and all that and somebody pulls out a gun. 
- [Narrator] Go-go's rise to national prominence stalled as the music became identified with violence. 
- It was part of society. Unfortunately, knuckleheads like music too. [Music] I'm feeling like a bum now [Music] 
- [Narrator] Under the name The Go Go Posse, a number of local bands recorded a single promoting an end to the violence, called D.C. Don't Stand for Dodge City. [Music] Like the wild wild west and its calamity [Music] [Music] But D.C. don't mean Dodge City [Music] [Music] D.C. don't mean Dodge City [Music] 
- Didn't change my life because go-go music oftentimes, it would glorify all of the things that this particular song was speaking against. 
- [Narrator] As the death toll mounted, the city gained a dubious title. 
- Washington is now called the murder capital of the country. 
- My kids were in high school at the time and they had on their wall a list of the people who they knew, either from their neighborhood or their school who had died. Before they graduated from Dunbar High School, that list had grown to 25 people. 
- [Narrator] While crack created squalor in previously vibrant residential neighborhoods, the city's commercial areas were enjoying a relative boom. 
- Downtown was dead. And Barry said we gotta do something about this. Developers went to him and said we want this, we want that, and gave them the land virtually free and these projects were built. 
- And we persuaded the banks and others to lend money to these developers. 
- [Narrator] After some politicking, the Georgetown Waterfront was one of the first vistas to see results. 
- Marion Barry recognized that Washington Harbor could be an enormous boom to the city and so he was very instrumental. 
- [Narrator] The success of projects in Georgetown and downtown gave Barry the confidence to try to redevelop less likely locations including ground zero of the '68 riots. 
- If you told someone you were going to 14 they knew you were going to buy drugs, period. 
- [Narrator] The Frank D. Reeves Municipal Center, named after the lawyer and local civil rights leader, opened in 1986. 
- People who were going to work in those offices every day would need services, and even though at the time it seemed fairly farfetched there was a certain sense that it would restore an element of validity to a once flourishing neighborhood. 
- [Narrator] Several long-closed icons of the past were also resurrected. The Old Post Office, a Romanesque Revival structure dating to 1899, had been on the verge of the wrecking ball for years. 
- [Arthur] Sir David Wills, who was heir to the tobacco fortune in England, cast a replica of the Westminster bells as a bicentennial gift to the United States. He had this idea that they should hang in the dome of the Capitol. 
- [Narrator] But the Capitol wasn't built for that purpose. 
- One bong of these great bells and the Capitol dome would be sitting down over the Mall. The congress was so concerned about it that they appropriated a new amount of money and that was what finally saved the entire building. 
- All this was done with partnerships and I think the results have been amazing. 
- [Narrator] Saving Union Station, a neglected Beaux-Art's masterpiece that had become the city's unofficial homeless shelter became the responsibility of a public private partnership. 
- I thought it was very successful. They were very careful in preserving great spaces. 
- [Narrator] D.C.'s downtown areas received an additional boost as a slew of local theaters opened their doors. 
- These little companies started springing up because downtown was so empty that they could get space cheap. The Wooly Mammoth and the Studio theaters opened on 14th Street, 14th Street sort of became the center of alternative theater. 
- [Narrator] But at first, residents weren't convinced. 
- I would go over there to watch some of their shows. 10, 15, 20 people in the audience plus the actors. 
- [Narrator] But in time, people's reluctance to come downtown eased, and Washington began its rise to America's second city of theater. 
- Washington was like that. I mean, it had certain kinds of cultural niches if you will. 
- I'm a Washingtonian and the first theater I ever saw was from the top balcony of the National. 
- [Narrator] As Washington's theater scene gained countrywide attention, it established an award named in honor of one of the city's most acclaimed daughters to recognize local theatrical excellence. 
- The great Washington Post critic, Richard Coe called on his friendship with Helen Hayes and together they created the Helen Hayes Awards and once the Helen Hayes Awards started, more companies started popping up. By the end of the decade, Washington was on the same playing field as Chicago. 
- [Narrator] The region's growing interest in the arts was exploited by Washington's TV affiliates, still hungry for novel programming. 
- The critics really-
- (drowned out by orchestral music) 
- The king of the critics in Washington D.C. was Davey Marlin-Jones. Davey was one of the most interesting people I had ever met. 
- There may be something there. 
- Davey wore hats. He also pushed the envelope with his clothes, he pushed his envelope in every way. 
- Tight. Taut. Tense. 
- Davey owned this town. 
- Inside the theater called life. 
- [Narrator] A popular format that encouraged imitation. 
- Every station in town had a critic and it was because we were all trying to compete with Davey. It was one of the great gags of local television. When he finished his report, you didn't know if he liked the movie or not. (chuckling) 
- Hope you find one cinematic sparkler among them. Davey Marlin-Jones. 
- I tried to make myself different from Davey so I used a ratings system. On my scale of one to four stars, Raiders of the Lost Ark gets a five. So at least when I was finished you would know what I thought of the movie or not. 
- [Narrator] In 1986, Washington's football team picked up journeyman quarterback Doug Williams to back up its young phenom, Jay Schroeder. During the following season, William shared quarterback duties with the oft-injured Schroeder. But once the team made it to the playoffs, Williams' performance put an end to any controversy. 
- We had to go to Chicago playing 13 below temperatures. We won. The championship game against the Minnesota Vikings, I came off the bench and we won the game and at coach's press conference, he mentioned that I was gonna be the starting quarterback, me being the first African American to play in the Superbowl. I really cherished that time, and for two weeks leading up to that game it was pretty much crazy. 
- [Narrator] The game started out badly. 
- [Announcer] Touchdown, Denver, 56-
- 
- The score was 10 to nothing against the Redskins in the first quarter. 
- [Narrator] And then, it got worse. 
- I hyper-extended my knee, didn't know it at that particular time whether or not I was gonna be able to finish the football game. 
- I was gonna substitute for him, he said hey, get back out, I want this, it's is my team. 
- Touchdown! 
- [Narrator] In a historic reversal of fortune, the team scored five touchdowns in the second quarter. 
- [Announcer] Touchdown! Washington takes the lead! 
- Everything we called worked. 
- [Announcer] He's got Sanders in the clear at the ten. Touchdown! Touchdown, Washington Redskins. And a new Superbowl record. 
- I remember him holding that helmet up, (laughing) when he scored 35 points in the second quarter. One of the greatest quarter of a game in Superbowl history. 
- [Announcer] Doug Williams, the MVP of Superbowl XXII. 
- [Narrator] Williams was the first black quarterback to start or win a Superbowl and was crowned the game's most valuable player. 
- It was one of those times that I raised my hat and thinking to myself, you know, I'd really like to tell some people where to go but it wasn't in my nature to do it. 
- [Narrator] As the '80s drew to a close, Barry's lifestyle continued to make headlines. 
- At no time did I see any drugs, use any drugs, or have any knowledge of any drugs. That little white powder is so powerful it causes you to do things you never thought you would do. 
- [Narrator] The FBI uncovered more allegations of drug use and rampant corruption among Barry's staff, and that included deputy mayor Ivanhoe Donaldson. 
- I have been tried, convicted, sentenced and doing time by some members of the media. 
- [Woman] I think Marion was very good about playing the victim. 
- Somebody set him up, (laughs) somebody was picking on him. 
- He didn't have the discipline to stick to virtually anything. I've heard more from Barry about how he's gonna behave better than I have from my own son. 
- [Narrator] Despite it all, Barry retained a grip on power, kept afloat by his populist appeal. 
- I think that some black folks in the city really thought that people were going after Marion because he was black, and I don't think that was necessarily the case. 
- I'm a very controversial person because I speak out. But on the other hand, I'm loved by a lot of people. In fact people say dang Barry, you're the best mayor we ever had. They're telling the truth, too. (laughing) 
- [Narrator] Marion Barry dominated Washington in the '80s. 
- He was the sun around which we all orbited. The good things, the bad things. 
- [Narrator] But even though the city and the mayor's early promise were now lost among dysfunction and decay, residents departed the '80s with good memories and optimism for the future. 
- You could do 60 miles an hour up Mass Avenue and nobody would blink an eye over it. 
- My kids who grew up in the middle of that look back fondly on their younger days. I'll never forget when they graduated they said we know the best part of our lives are probably behind us right now. [Music] Ooh shake it [Music]
