- This week on America's birthday, known as Independence Day or simply July 4th, Donald Trump threw himself a party. Ever since he saw that the French president has a parade, it's called Bastille Day and the dictator of North Korea has a parade, it's called Authoritarianism, and that they get to have tanks and people marching in front of them and saluting them and all that stuff, he's wanted to have one too. He tried to co-opt other holidays to get his parade like Veterans Day or Memorial Day but the adults in the military kept pushing him back. Well no more. Donald Trump finally got his special Donald Trump parade. Rolling tanks down the streets of your capital, flying Air Force planes over his head while he gave an odd speech about the airports, the Continental Congress took control of during the Revolutionary War. 
- In June of 1775, the Continental Congress created a unified army out of the revolutionary forces encamped around Boston and New York and named after the great George Washington, Commander-in-Chief. The Continental Army suffered a bitter winter at Valley Forge, found glory across the waters of the Delaware and seized victory from Cornwallis of Yorktown. Our army manned the airports, it rend the ramparts, it took over the airports, it did everything it had to do and it fought McHenry under the rocket's red glare, it had nothing but victory. 
- Okay! I'm sure that you know this already because you paid attention in school, but just so that it's said, the Continental Army was not named after George Washington. There was no air travel during the Revolutionary War. Airplanes weren't even invented until 1903. And the Battle at Fort McHenry happened during The War of 1812! Details! In the end, for millions of your tax dollars, this what you, well actually what Donald Trump got. 
- On this day, 243 years ago, our founding fathers pledged their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honor to declare Independence and defend our God-given rights. 
- Throwing not an American president but what looks like an authoritarian leader. Festooned by his military and making a show of force to, well it's not really clear who. Because Donald Trump actually really likes dictators. Joining me now is Maria Teresa Kumar, president and CEO of Voto Latino. Jelani Cobb, professor at Columbia Journalism School, Craig Unger, Vanity Fair contributor and author of House of Trump, House of Putin and Representative Ted Lieu, Democrat from California and a member of the Foreign Affairs and Judiciary committees. I wanna go to you first Congressman. What did you make of it? Watching an American president do this thing that Tom Nichols who's an expert on the history of the Soviet Union and of that region, described as looking like an old Soviet kind of parade. 
- Thank you Joy for your question. Let me just first say that natural disasters like earthquakes can strike at any time and I urge everyone to be prepared with supplies and a safety plan. Now to answer your question, one of the big problems with Trump's July 4th event, is that it was a campaign event paid for by the American taxpayer. Not only did he divert millions of dollars to this event, he also had the Republican National Committee give out passes, VIP passes to major donors. That was outrageous. That was really a violation of our ethics and he made a mockery of our Independence Day. 
- And thank you for mentioning what's going on in your state. We just saw two natural disasters in the state of California. So this is a time when the federal government actually has priorities that are important, that we should be spending money on. Things like making sure, that states are ready for natural disasters like you just saw in your state. So when you see the President of the United States diverting money so that he can have planes fly over him rather than spending the money on important things like that or maybe uncaging children, which he's also doing in the state of California and Arizona and other places. As a member of Congress, is there something that you guys plan to do about that? Because this does seem like a tremendous waste of money. 
- Members of Congress can't even use official resources to participate in a parade. In this case, Trump diverted $2.5 million of National Park fees to pay for his party. And I've asked the Federal Election Commission to look into this because how can you have all this taxpayer money do this event and then have the Republican National Committee be involved in such a major way handing out VIP passes to their major donors. 
- Yeah, and besides that, I wanna go to you Craig Unger. You've written a lot about Donald Trump his Mafia sort of relationships that he's had throughout his career, particularly when it comes to Russia. This is what Michael McFaul, who is the former US Ambassador to Russia tweeted after Donald Trump's weird parade. He said, I knew this was coming. Tweet from Julia Davis News, Russia's state TV is obsessively bashing Trump's low energy, weak parade with rusty tanks. The host's LOL at Trump's claim about Revolutionary War airports, and other historical flubs. There's your city upon a hill. There's your world leader, and Martians have been defeated. The fact is that Donald Trump not only wasted America's money, to make himself a campaign commercial, but he also has subjected the United States to mockery because real dictatorships know what a dictator parade is supposed to look like Craig. 
- Right, well at least sometimes they get their facts straight. It's interesting that if the Russian State TV is going after Trump, that doesn't happen without Vladimir Putin's say-so. It's also interesting that clip you showed, the number of historical errors and it is just extraordinary and the White House has an office of speech writing with lots of researchers and interns and they fact-check things. And there are only three possibilities for that level of transcendental stupidity to take place. One is, that that office is completely filled with people with room temperature IQ. The other is that all the procedures have fallen apart and they don't exist anymore. And the third possibility is it sprung from the brain of Donald Trump and that is deeply, deeply disturbing. 
- There's a lot about it that's disturbing Jelani. I wanna go to you on this, I'm glad that you're here just to have an historical context to all of this. Donald Trump really admires dictatorships around the world. He seems to really admire Kim Jong Un. All of the media has been saying that this is supposed to be sort of his version of the Bastille Day ceremony. But I pointed out earlier this week on MSNBC the whole Bastille Day thing is about sending a message to dictators. That's what the whole Bastille Day parade is about. This is clearly not that, because Donald Trump likes dictators. That's not what you're trying to send a message doing. So in your mind, what is this, what was the message of what you saw, I don't know if you watched it but what was the message that you think came out of what Donald Trump did this week? 
- Oh it was pure and grandiosity and self-inflation. And so one of the things I think that's significant here is that the United States at least in theory is supposed to operate on the doctrine that we are a nation of laws, that no one is above the law and that the constitution is the fundamental authority. That is a different position, fundamentally different position than a state in which the personality or the authoritarian leader is the head of all interests and ideas within the state. And so what Donald Trump did, was essentially hijack this idea and turn it into something that was supposed to glorify himself. This kinda interesting paradox here which is that several years ago, I did a Fulbright Fellowship and I spent an entire semester in Moscow teaching at Moscow State University and at the end of the semester, there was the May 9th Celebration. Anybody who has been to Russia or knows about their history post World War II, May 9th is a gigantic celebration that happens each year, somewhere between the 4th of July and New Year's and it is a recognition of the Soviet defeat of the Nazi threat, an existential threat that confronted them during World War II. So it's a huge and I'm able to be there for the parade and there's just this kind of complete procession of military vehicles. There are missiles, there are tanks, there are armored vehicles, there are Jeeps and it looks like an army amassing for an invasion. And so someone turns to me and says, do you do the same thing in the United States on the 4th of July. I said no, this would never happen in the United States because they in the United States believe, we believe that there should be a really clear distinction between civilian authority and military might and that our authority is supposed to, at least in theory stem from our laws and our moral beliefs. And what Donald Trump did, was essentially invert that to create it as a kind of satirical almost emulation of something that he sees in Vladimir Putin. We should recognize this as the anti-democratic movement that it actually was. 
- Yeah, Maria Teresa, there's an example. I mean Eugene Robinson made a similar point when he talked about the fact that Trump tried to make himself look big by doing this piece. A little bit of what Eugene, what he wrote, it was clear from the beginning that Independence Day meant nothing more to Trump than an opportunity to choreograph a made for television re-election event and give himself an obscenely expensive ego message. It invoked mockery. There's a cartoon, we're gonna show here that's drawn on what airplanes would look like during the Revolutionary War. It's a picture of Ben Franklin attached to two kites, there it is and this is by somebody I know. This is by the great Natalie Johnson who drew that. Here's the reality, Donald Trump it seems wants to be seen as this big man. He wants to be seen as this grand leader of this great military but what he actually can accomplish through his own, the quality of the staff that he has around him, is he can't do that. He can't do what Jelani just talked about, right? The reality was right, even in the case of Russia which now is an adversary of the United States, during World War II they were fighting the Nazis. So if they're doing a big celebration and talking about defeating the Nazi Empire, they're sort of sending a message again to dictators. There are only two kinds of these parades. There's that, and there's the one like in North Korea. Trump is tying to do it because I think he thinks he's emulating it, he doesn't even know how. 
- Or really why! 
- This is to Maria. 
- We're the largest military operators in the world. We don't have to show that type of display of force because the world already knows it. And what I found so disappointing when it came to the July 4th is July 4th is to commemorate our roots as Americans. Where we come from, the fact that we may have fled different countries or we came here because we recognize that. Our Americanism, our DNA is this idea that we're a nation of immigrants and we have strength and we don't have to show military might because the world already knows it. And what Donald Trump did was such a sad display because he didn't have the courage to actually join the military when his card was up. He instead deferred on bone spurs. And so he basically, not only deteriorates the flag but also the meaning of what it means to be an American and what it means to be July 4th, what it means to come together as a nation. The reason that presidents don't show up on July 4th and don't make it about them, is because it's one country under one flag and one unity. It's not supposed to be partisan and what instead he did is he created a campaign rally, trying to differentiate and divide us and what I espouse and what I think was really beautiful is that you still saw families on that lawn saying, I'm apolitical, I'm here to share it with my families. And that's what we should remind people of what July 4th is. We don't have to show military might, we don't have to scare the world, we know what we are, we know who we are and we know that we do it with justice. The fact that he can do this in the backdrop of caging children, that is not who we are and the more that we can actually make sure that we are standing strong to those values, despite about what I call this aberration in our history, we have to make sure that we are very clear minded of what it means to be American and what it means to be democratic and what it means to be fair and just. 
- Yeah, very quickly just let everybody go through one last chance. Jelani, do you think that what you saw, what Donald Trump made us look stronger or weaker as a country? 
- Oh absolutely weaker. The worst part of it is that, had this actually not been an inept display of pseudo-authoritarianism, we still would have looked weaker. If he had done this correctly, in air quotes, correctly, we would have looked weaker. But now we look doubly weak, because it is a poor imitation of something that was never meant to be imitated in the first place. 
- Yeah, very quickly and to go to you Craig. When the Russians look at us, they're already laughing at us. Donald Trump thinks they're his best friends. Are they his friends or is he now a subject of even mockery to them? 
- Well, I think he is subject to mockery and I think Jelani is absolutely right. The images that come away from it today, are that we have concentration camps on the border, we have tanks by the Lincoln Memorial. The mall is, there was an interesting piece in the Washington Post. The architecture is about reconciliation. It's by the Lincoln Memorial, our original sin was slavery, we had a Civil War and this is where we were supposed to have reconciliation and instead, today we have images of tanks and the whole crisis at the border. 
- I'm gonna give you the last word Congressman because you are a member of the Air Force I believe. You've served in the military. As a person who actually did serve, unlike Donald Trump, when you saw tanks rolling down the nation's capital, your thoughts were what? 
- Having served in active duty in the military, we've been trained to not participate in partisan campaign events. There was a Department of Defense directive that prohibits military members from showing up in uniform at a campaign rally. This was a massive taxpayer-funded campaign rally with the Republican National Committee handing out VIP passes. It really eroded what should be a non-partisan military and that was sad and disappointing. 
- Thank you all for being here and sending out really good thoughts to your state Congressman Lieu. Thank you very much all of you. Maria Teresa is gonna be back. Jelani Cobb, Craig Unger and Congressman Ted Lieu, thank you guys very much and coming up, as Donald Trump celebrated himself on the 4th of July, people looking for a better future were locked in cages on our southern border. Great, more on that next.

- In fact one of the women said, that she was told by an agent to drink water out of the toilet. 
- This week Democratic lawmakers once again saw for themselves the shameful conditions that migrant children and adults have been forced to live in. Specifically at a detention facility in Clint, Texas. Conditions that the Department of Homeland Security's Inspector General confirmed in a report this week. Now let me read to you some of the findings. Quote, children at three of the five border patrol facilities that we visited had no access to showers. At these facilities children had limited access to a change of clothes. Border patrol had few spare clothes and no laundry facilities. While all facilities had infant formula, diapers, baby wipes and juice and snacks for children, we observed that two facilities had not provided children access to hot meals. But Customs and Border Patrol, were so desperate to dispel these firsthand accounts from lawmakers and from activists that one of its chiefs filmed a video showing a supply room filled with an abundance of clothing and hygienic supplies, as well as clean drinking areas at a detention facility, wait for it, three hundred miles away in Arizona. There it is. Back with me, Maria Teresa Kumar and also joining me, Andrea Pitzer who's a journalist and author of One Long Night: A Global History of Concentration Camps and Elora Mukherjee who's a director of the Immigrants Rights Clinic at Columbia Law School and Elora is also a lawyer who has visited detention centers at the southern border for the last 12 years. And Elora, thank you for being here. I'm gonna start with you. I wanna play for you a little bit of a video that was obtained of a 12-year old girl, a 12 year-old migrant. This was her account for being detained for two weeks. It's in Spanish, for those of you who are watching, so you'll have to just read the subtitles if you don't speak Spanish but hear you go. Elora, we've heard stories of little kids being forced to take care of other little kids. Children sleeping on the ground in nothing but a diaper, children saying that they only got one meal a day. We heard this little girl's horrifying story of being detained, is this legal? 
- No, this is absolutely not legal. Federal law provides for protections for children in Federal Immigration custody. The 1997 Flores Settlement Agreement requires that the Federal government provide safe and sanitary conditions for children in its custody. A law from 2008 which was passed with unanimous bipartisan support and passed by President George W. Bush says that children must not be detained by Customs and Border Patrol for any longer than 72 hours. The conditions that we're learning about, what we hear, what I smelled when I was at these facilities, it is unlawful and illegal. 
- And then Elora, how can they, this is what I have not understood and I'm gonna go to you first and then I'm gonna go to Maria Teresa Kumar because we've talked for a long time about why they might be doing it. They're holding kids for 50 days, 40 days, 30 days. They're holding them as if almost like, it's like they're ransom, they can't leave. How can they get away with it, if it is illegal? 
- It is illegal and what's important to know is that most of these children have family members in the United States who are desperate to have their children back. More than 80% of children released from the federal government are housed and cared for and loved for by their own family members. We need immediate congressional oversight and pressure on this administration to release children from detention as quickly as possible. And while children are detained, they must be treated humanely. 
- Yeah, and you know Maria Teresa Kumar, I have to go to you on this because, we have been down there, you have been there much more than I have, obviously Elora has been there. I'm not a lawyer, it strikes me as completely illegal to hold children in this manner when as Elora just said they have family to go to. Donald Trump calls that catch-and-release and says he's not doing it. Why in your view are they holding these children? Is it the money that they're making? I mean it's 750 bucks a day to hold kids in these camps. Is it straight money? Why are they not letting them go? 
- I think there's a couple of things. I think one is political fodder. It shows that he is the strong-fisted person that is basically making sure that, they're trying to use this as a deterrent. He didn't come up with this. This is Steve Miller, his senior advisor with his fingerprints all over it. But it allows, it's good for political fodder for his base, that he is being tough and that it's really the parents' fault that they came here. But two, there's a lot of money to be made. The moment that Donald Trump was elected into office, all of a sudden the private detention facilities, the for-profit detention facilities, their stock prices went, literally went on the rise. The former Chief of Staff John Kelly who advised President Trump and before was head of the DHS, he was also one of the architects of this. Guess where John Kelly is now. He is now on the board of advisors to one of the largest detention for-profit facilities. He has actually gone down to Homestead down in Florida which is one of the largest facilities that houses close to 3200 minors. And they keep them for a long time. Unlike President Obama who did have the moniker of deporter in chief, President Obama processed individuals and deported them. This president has little intention of deporting them. These children who are minors are not supposed to be in custody for more than 20 days. In some cases, they languish in there for months. In some cases, almost a year. And it's clear that the only way that you do it is that you ensure that someone is making a lot of profit and you do it away from the cameras, you do it away from the American public and you do it almost in secret. The fact that this is basically, you have some ICE agents actually coming out and anonymously showing pictures of what is happening in the facilities. They're trying to also ring the red light of this is not normal, this is illegal and we need the American people to stand up for it. The fact that the United Nations have declared that the United States is in violation of children's human rights should be screaming at the top of the lungs of every single American saying this is not who we are. And we have to make this a political campaign issue because this is what we actually stand for. 
- Andrea, we've had a whole bunch of people getting upset and debating over what you call these camps. I don't know what else you would call it other than concentration camps. If these children are being deliberately held longer than they're legally allowed to be held, they won't let them go. They seem to be displaying their misery really to sort of entertain, I don't know what it is that they're trying to show the American people but they seem to want us to know that they're doing this to these kids. We even had a young man, who was allegedly shamed. They hung a sign on him, saying I like men, in Spanish and put a sign on him to try to humiliate him. This reminds me almost of the way that we behaved at Abu Ghraib, where we were just trying to display the mockery of these people. I don't understand what's going on here. I don't understand how it can possibly be going on and that no one's stopping it, your thoughts Andrea. 
- So, look it's no surprise that there are echos of prior camp systems from Abu Ghraib and going back more than 100 years even, in what we're seeing on the border today. The turn of the 20th century, Emily Hobhouse went down to southern Africa and was shocked that the British weren't providing soap to children and women in detention so that they could prevent contagious diseases. Tens of thousands of people would die in those camps while parliament argued over whether it was fair to call them concentration camps. In Germany, in 1933 a man named Hans Beimler was arrested and taken to Dachau where the Nazis put a sign around his neck to humiliate him. So we've seen this all before. We've seen the humiliating signs, no soap, arguments over what to call it, overcrowding, deaths from contagious diseases. What we have is not a death camp system like Auschwitz but it is a concentration camp system. It's a malevolent system that has deep roots in a polarized society that is willing to do harm to vulnerable people. And the thing is that, if the authorities don't intervene, we know what's going to happen. We're gonna move to the next stage of concentration camp abuses, which are gonna show up not as negligence but as atrocities. 
- I'm gonna ask all of you to please come back-
- 
- Can I just add something-
- 
- Very quickly. 
- Okay! 
- Yeah, very quickly. 
- So Joy I think the bigger issue too is that we know that a lot of these folks that are getting these government contracts actually served as security guards for Afghanistan and for Iraq. They have no business being surrounded by children. 
- Yeah, absolutely. I wanna have you guys come back. Because we wanna try to think about what these children can do. I don't know if there's some lawsuit. We need to figure out what to do next. Thank you very much Maria Teresa Kumar, I'm sorry I'm out of time. Andrea Pitzer, Elora Mukherjee, thank you all three very much and later on this hour we are gonna talk about this disturbing new information that we're learning about the culture at the Border Protection Agency. So please stay tuned for that. And coming up next, even after he was slapped down by the Supreme Court, Donald Trump is still not giving up on his attempts to rig the census. It's just getting better and better and better. We'll be right back.

- Okay! Officials in Southern California are assessing the damage after the second powerful earthquake in the region in just the last two days. Friday's quake had a magnitude of 7.1 and was centered in the desert city of Ridgecrest. It was felt more than 100 miles away in Los Angeles and in Las Vegas. It rattled homes and businesses and sparked fires and power outages. At a baseball game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Diego Padres, Dodgers Stadium seemed to shake and roll for nearly a minute, but the players played on. Friday's quake comes one day after a 6.4 magnitude earthquake in the same region. And officials say there will likely be more. Stay with MSNBC throughout the day for the latest on this story. And up next in AM Joy, Trump and his far-right allies want to rig the census to beat back a changing America. But since he's Donald Trump, he may have already tanked his own case.

- The census, is a constitutionally mandated operation that we are required to implement every 10 years. It is one of the most vital and sensitive things that we do in our government. I want to know why this question was magically added after we have seen that a political operative knew and detailed an intent to intimidate racial and immigrant communities for a partisan purpose. 
- A recent Supreme Court decision last month in which Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the liberals on the court, made it clear, the majority on the court saw right through the Trump administration's attempts to rig the constitutionally required United States census to try and take money and resources away from non-white people and immigrants. The Trump administration's attempts to pretend that they really wanted to add a citizenship question to the census to help them enforce the Voting Rights Act, were easily seen right through. And while the career lawyers at the Justice Department seemed content to listen to the court, apparently Donald Trump was not. After going on a Twitter tirade apparently after canoodling with his far-right allies Donald Trump has ordered the DOJ to try again. Now, a federal judge in Maryland has ordered a new version of the case to be heard. On Friday Trump invented a new power that he thinks he has as president. Saying that he's considering an executive order to force the citizenship question on to the census. 
- [Reporter] Are you going to issue an executive order on the census? 
- We're thinking about doing that. It's one of the ways, we have four or five ways we can do it. It's one of the ways that we're thinking about doing it very seriously. We're doing well on the census. We can also add an addition on, so we can sort the printing now and maybe do an addendum after we get a positive decision. So we're working on a lot of things including an executive order. 
- Well it should go without saying that you cannot overrule a Supreme Court decision with an executive order. Should go without saying but I guess we still have to say it. Joining me now is MSNBC legal analyst Maya Wiley. @AdamSerwer of The Atlantic and Latosha Brown, co-founder of Black Voters Matter. Maya, can one overrule a Supreme Court decision, I'll just have you answer it, by having an executive order? 
- No! 
- Excellent! So let's move on to the next question. 
- No I mean but seriously-
- 
- I think it's important just to make it clear. 
- Well I think what's really important here is even Justice Roberts in his opinion, said that judicial review is not just an empty vehicle. That it has to have meaning. He was explicit in the opinion. Think about this, a Chief Justice of the Supreme Court felt the need to say that in an opinion. That is astounding and Donald Trump has proven why it was necessary to say. Department of Justice lawyers right now are trying to figure out how to do what they have an oath to do, which is uphold the laws of the United States. And there is no higher legal vehicle in the land in terms of how to understand our constitution or interpret our statutes, than the Supreme Court. 
- And you know Adam, there's the story that's sort of enveloping here is that Donald Trump gets slapped down by the Supreme Court. He then is canoodling with his friends on the far-right and maybe the alt-right, maybe the people from his former folks like Steve Bannon, whoever he was talking to. Then he gets mad, he does this tweet storm, where he says that it's fake, that they're not gonna fight to get this question onto the census. So he puts up that as true, which is just a straight out lie. And now you have the Department of Justice twisting itself into knots to try to figure out a way to do what they've been told to do, which is to still find a way to get this issue onto the census. And we know from the reporting that's out there that the original reason for it was that they wanted to defund areas that had a lot of immigrants in it, especially non-white immigrants. They wanna give white voters an advantage by only counting citizens knowing that, something like 6.5 million people probably wouldn't even answer the census if it was on there. The fact that they're making it this blatant, your thoughts. 
- Well, I just wanna say one thing. This is not a question of far-right, this is the Republican establishment that hatched this scheme for weakening the voting influence of voters of color to increase white voting power. This is an absolutely establishment Republican scheme that Donald Trump recognizes is important if the Republican Party wants to keep winning in elections in a diversifying country. They need to figure out a way to make white votes count more. And when they went to the Supreme Court, they gave them a fictional reason and of all the conservative justices on the Supreme Court, only Roberts was willing to say it was fictional. The other Supreme Court justices said that the plaintiffs were acting like conspiracy theorists in suggesting that the Commerce Secretary was lying. Well now the president has confirmed it. This is about districting, this is about diluting the minority vote. This is not about enforcing the Voting Rights Act. And everyone knew that was a pretext. But what they tried to do was not simply lie to the court. Not simply lie to the American people but tell them the thing that they were seeing in front of their eyes was false. 
- Yeah, and just to show you all the, and thank you for making that point because this has been a long term thing trying to game and game and game the system because they know demographics are changing and they don't want it to change their power, lemme just play the Donald Trump soundbite that goes with what Adam was just saying which is where Donald Trump admits that it's about districting. It's about using the census to increase the power of his side, take a listen. 
- Well you need it for many reasons. Number one you need it for Congress, you need it for Congress, for districting. You need it for appropriations, where are the funds going, how many people are there? Are they citizens, are they not citizens? You need it for many reasons. 
- Maya, normally when somebody is that blatant about admitting that their whole reason that they're saying they're going in front of the court for is a lie, that would be the end of it. But Donald Trump has gotten away with this before. He said that the Muslim ban was a Muslim ban and then he said, no, no, I didn't mean it and the court pretended he never said it. So, do we have a risk here, that the partisans on the court and maybe that includes Roberts. He's not been a huge fan of voting rights. Could they just change their reason and then slide this right past the Supreme Court? 
- It's a little bit complicated but procedurally. But let's say this, one of the things that Chief Justice Roberts did, was spent about 22 pages saying why the administration could put this question on the census despite the fact that the careerists, the people who behave in a non-partisan way in the Census Bureau said no, we don't think this question should go on in order to do what we need to do as a census. That's really important and what the minority on the court said, what the liberals on the court said was, we actually don't think the whole first part of that opinion is right. We think that this arbitrary and capricious which is the legal language for, aint no reason for this, no good reason. That the fact that the careerists said, no this is bad, means it shouldn't happen. And just one more thing I just wanna add. 2010, Republicans underfunded this census even before Trump was elected. 
- Yeah absolutely and they sort of made war on it. Let me go to you quickly Natasha, because well how will this look on the ground? If people are afraid to answer the census, then what? 
- I think part of the problem if people are afraid to answer the census, what you're gonna see is you're gonna see a gross under-count. You're gonna particularly see an under-count in communities of color and the challenge with that is there over $800 million of aid that is actually, goes by census data. So you'll see a gross under-count because of this. But I think that there's another issue that I just wanna raise around the president. That we really have a rogue president that in this process in particular, here is executive that's saying that immediately after the Supreme Court ruling, he's actually saying that I'm considering these options. One, I'm considering this option around executive order and then the second thing he's saying he's considering the option of having an addendum. This is a president that does not even respect the law of the land. I really think that we're in a constitutional crisis and we don't need to act like this is normal. This is not normal, this is not acceptable. This is beyond, he took a oath and swore that he would actually uphold the law of the land. Yet we're seeing this play out very differently. I think we need to make the distinction that here it is, that immediately after the Supreme Court made a decision, he says that he's going to do whatever he wants to do anyway and we've gotta take that seriously. 
- Yeah absolutely! Well hopefully there's a plan. We're gonna have you guys come back and talk about this more. Maya and Adam will be back, and Latosha Brown we'll have you back to talk about what the plan is gonna be if he's somehow able to thwart the law. All right, and coming up, the secret Facebook group of Border Patrol agents that is raising new questions about the treatment of migrants and the culture of the CBP, that's next.

- This is political insanity. When you need a passionate start to the morning. 
- Name one of the Democratic contenders, name one that you are positive can beat Trump. You need your Morning Joe. Weekdays at six, on MSNBC. 
- 52% of the force is Latino. And a lot of people ask me, how do they get Latino people then to behave this way against people who are their own heritage and their own culture? And it's because in the academy, they mandate and they teach the agents to use racist terms for migrants so that they see these people as other and that they're not like them. It does have an effect. It's condoned, and when it happens and if somebody complains, everybody groups together, specifically more the male side and they protect each other. 
- A second formerly secret Facebook group frequented by current and former Customs and Border Patrol agents has been unearthed. CNN obtained screenshots from two sources familiar with the Facebook pages that contain vulgar and sexually explicit posts mocking migrants and demeaning lawmakers like Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. It comes on the heels of a separate, secret Facebook group that was exposed earlier this week. NBC News has not independently verified these Facebook groups or posts and back with me Maya Wiley and Adam Serwer. Adam, you have posts like feeling kinda cute, might separate some families today, IDK, for I don't know. You have another group member that was apparently on these posts, who posted a photo of the father and his 23-month old daughter, they both died lying face down the Rio Grande. Asked if the photo could have been faked because the bodies were so quote, clean. It goes on and on and on and as you just heard in that soundbite, some of these are actually Latino. It's not all only white members of the CBP. What the heck is going on in your view? 
- Well anytime you give one group of people authority over another group of people you run the risk that the people with authority are gonna see themselves as above or better than the people who they have authority over. And the way you mitigate that in a democracy is you say, well these people are public servants. They are actually employed by the public, they don't lord over the public. And the problem with that is that if you create a culture of impunity where public servants who have that kind of authority particularly the authority over life and death are never held accountable when they abuse that authority, then they begin to rationalize those abuses as somehow justified or necessary. And I think that that's what we're seeing here particularly with the Trump administration imposing policies that are cruel beyond what we've seen in previous administrations even when those administrations have been strict on immigration enforcement. And the people who carry out those policies have to be able to figure out a way to justify what they're doing and one way that they do that is by denying the humanity of the people that they have authority over. 
- Yeah you know, the dehumanization of these folks, it did remind me, Chris Hayes put up a post and it brings back the memories of the way people treated others during the invasion of Iraq. The sense of, these aren't even people. Or in our own past, the way that people were able to treat others, whether it's from enslavement on but they're just not people so we don't have to think of them as human beings. You have this Customs and Border protection spokesperson saying this does not reflect the values of CBP. How can that even be true? They're two different groups, where people are making this kinds of mockeries, Maya. 
- Yeah, it's clearly not true. I think assuming all these posts are accurate but we have no reason to believe they aren't because there was a 2018 exposure, the Facebook groups existed in 2018 and I think part of the problem here exactly what Adam said is the leadership has to say, not only is this not who we are as an institution, it is not what we will tolerate as managers. And that's critically important. If you don't take action where you have the authority to take action against employees. In this case there is an ability to take disciplinary action, if there's inappropriate social media activity. You have to balance that with First Amendment Rights of course, but here the question is, people who have the ability, who are armed, who can actually violate the human rights of other people must be held to account, when they're essentially dehumanizing in a way, that really undermines the effectiveness of the agency which is supposed to be impartial. Remember that people coming to the border have a lawful right based in international law as well as US law to seek asylum and the dehumanization is both offensive but it also fundamentally undermines the role that they are to play at the border and we should be very concerned about that. 
- I think I quote you every week Adam. The cruelty is the point. Like that's why they're doing it. His base wants to see this. And so he's showing them that he can dehumanize them. Isn't that message coming from the White House? That essentially you don't have to treat these people like human beings, who cares? 
- I do think the message is coming from the White House that these people are not real human beings and you don't have to treat them properly. I will say though, that when it comes to children that the administration is very aware that its policies are at their political weakest point when people see these images of children being abused or being held in dehumanizing conditions. With the adults it's a little different. The president likes to brag about how he's gonna deport a million people and they're gonna do a crackdown and all that stuff. But when it comes to the children, I actually think they recognize that this is damaging for them among everyone but the most hardcore Trump supporters who would defend anything the president did no matter how horrendous. 
- Yeah, but they're not doing anything about it Maya. That doesn't mean that they're changing it. They won't let these kids go. That is the thing that keeps striking me Maya, they wot let them go. They're holding them for almost 60 days in some point, they just won't let them go. 
- They won't let them go. 
- If they see that it's wrong, why don't they let 'em go? 
- They won't let them go and they're actually, remember we have that astounding appearance in court where they were in violation of the settlement agreement and said, oh well, we don't even have to provide soap. 
- Yeah, and they moved them to another facility because they knew that the cameras were coming, mocked the members of Congress in front of the supervisors who did nothing and then moved the kids right back in. If they really believe that, if they say they're gonna deport they're not even doing that, anyway it's insane. Anyway, Maya will be right back. Adam Serwer thank you very much. I really appreciate and I'll keep on quoting you. More AM Joy after the break.

- I know predators and we have a predator living in the White House. And the thing about predators you should know is that they prey on the vulnerable. They prey on those who they do not believe are strong. 
- Welcome back to AM Joy. We're almost three years after Hillary Clinton became the first woman presidential nominee of a major US political party. We now have six women running for president in 2020. Among the, Senator Kamala Harris, who along with calling Donald Trump a predator, shared exactly why she says that she has the credibility to take him down. 
- I've had a lot of fights, most which I've won. I know how to fight and let me tell you, we're gonna also need somebody who can successfully prosecute the case against another four years of that administration. I know how to do that. 
- Senator Harris, along with Senator Elizabeth Warren saw their stocks soar in new national polls, after the first presidential debates. A Quinnipiac poll that was released just Tuesday showed Harris surging 13 points since last month into second place, only two points behind front runner Joe Biden. That after Harris challenged Biden over his comments about working with segregationist senators and his opposition to federally mandated busing in the 1970s. When asked which candidate did the best job at the debate 47% said Harris, and she was followed by Senator Elizabeth Warren with 17%. Only 6% said that former vice president Biden had the best performance. And when asked which candidate has the best policy ideas, Warren took the lead with 31% compared to 19% in April. Sanders came in at 18% while Biden received 11% a drop from 23 in April. Now despite these numbers Biden remains the nominal front runner, even if barely and the changes in the standings in the race are re-upping the question of whether America is finally, finally ready to elect a woman president. There are now six options, most of them more politically experienced and savvy than Trump. So if not now then when. Maya Wiley of The New School is back with me. Also joining new is Rashad Robinson of Color of Change. Tiffany Cross of The Beat DC and Dean Obeidallah, host of the Dean Obeidallah Show on SiriusXM. I'm gonna go to you first Rashad, glad I just ran into you last night, watching Missy Elliott here (laughs) at the Essence Festival 25th Anniversary, hey! And so I'm wondering if you had a chance. I don't know when you got here but I don't know if you've had a chance to walk around and have conversations with people that you're running into down here at Essence. Tell me what you're hearing. Is the Kamala boom resonating in the real world or is this just us people who are obsessed with polls? 
- I think it's a mix of both. I think it's one, it is people that are obsessed with polls and those of us in the political class who follow these things, are sort of deeply invested in looking at the upticks and the downticks but people are coming to understand who Kamala Harris is, and understanding her track record. And paying closer attention to us and that's the power of these debates. I also am hearing Elizabeth warren's name a lot. From a number of people as I walk around and particularly the way that she's rolled out a set of plans and exactly how she's talking about how she's going to close some of the gaps that have plagued communities for so long. I do think it's just incredibly early and even the sort of ticks and hits that Biden has taken to his polls is a recognition that, many of his early numbers, were just that people knew who he was. It's like going into a store, a supermarket and you pick the product off the shelf that you've seen the most commercials for, that you know you have the most attention to but over time you might change that as you learn more things. And so I do think that it's just really early but I do think that these debates are shifting the landscape and giving people more on opportunity to see candidates in a different way. 
- Yeah, and that's a very good point Tiffany because there is a certain huge advantage that Biden had just because people knew who he is. And people didn't know who a lot of these candidates were until like 23 million people watched that second debate and said, oh she's interesting. I wonder if you think that there's also a potential though that's it's a little deeper and that it might be more like 2008. Where people didn't really know who Barack Obama was either but when they saw him in comparison and realized that he was plausible. I mean, look at these numbers, Biden is now only two points ahead in this latest polls. Right, in Quinnipiac. She's only tow points down from him. Warren is right up there. She's passed Bernie Sanders, is now at 14, statistically tied but one point ahead of him. She's gone up 13, Harris. Biden's gone down eight. It looks like she's taking that lead from him and I wonder if he's maybe a bit too comfortable assuming I'm the guy black voters like. But if you even look among African-Americans, here's that next poll, she's only you know, four points down among African-Americans. It's a huge change. It feels a little bit like Barack Obama versus Hillary Clinton in that '08 primary or am I reading too much into it, Tiffany? 
- Oh well, first let me say I have serious FOMO that all you guys are at the Essence Festival and I'm missing out. I don't wanna hear about Missy Elliott, I'm not there, I have FOMO, I don't like it. But, back to the issue at hand, back to the point. I think a lot of the, so many people put how they feel about these candidates through the lens of cable news networks. And so when you have people offering analysis and how they feel even after debate, a lot of times that conversation is driven by a media lacking in diversity. Ethnic diversity, diversity of thoughts, socioeconomic diversity and so people tend to look through this very myopic lens about debate performances. Even the conversations that follow the debates, it became again all about Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Joe Biden. We forget that Julian Castro had an amazing performance. He's a very overlooked candidate I think. So I think we have to look at this full scope to Rashad's point, it is still very early in the process. You and I talk about this a lot Joy. You know how I feel about the polls. You have to consider, polls are mostly older Americans, people who answer landlines. People who answer landlines from an unidentified caller. You're not gonna have a lot of people doing that and we have to disaggregate the data. Look, I think Kamala Harris is a very electable candidate. There are other members in this very crowded slate who are electable and the American people will ultimately say yeah. Ultimately you can't put all your credence into what polls are saying and what media analysts even say. And so we have to, there's another debate coming up at the end of July. We have to look at this in a more, I think wider lens than what sometimes offered in some of these mainstream outlets. 
- I agree with you 'cause we talk about this all the time but I have to say and I'm gonna go to Dean on this because here's the challenge. Everything that Tiffany just said is true. But, most people don't have time to follow all this stuff. They don't have time to follow all the polls so they look at the polls, they listen to us talk about it. You talk about the great debate that Julian Castro had, he didn't move in the polls and so then it feeds on itself. And so that next debate comes around and he had a great debate but he didn't move. And so the thing is people are trying to think I gotta narrow these 800 people down to like four. Right, they gotta stop thinking about it as four or five, instead of 40. The next debate, do you think maybe the Democratic Party ought to narrow it down a little bit? It would eliminate somebody who's not polling very high like Julian Castro who had a contribution to make but do you think it's bad, for us to now do another 23 people in the debate. 
- I think let this July debates, it's basically set right now, go forward. The next debate, September, already the field is smaller. But look, this is going to be a battle. Donald Trump talked about it on the 4th of July. Like when the Revolutionary Army took the airports, this that kind of battle we're talking about. The battle of LaGuardia, en route to JFK. This is the kind of fight we're talking about that's gonna happen between now and November 2020. But internally in Democratic Party, things are gonna change, they're gonna move. People want someone to win. My listeners who call my show, there are three factors they want in a Democratic nominee. Who can beat Trump, who can beat Trump and who can beat Trump. That is the key and they say every time, vote blue no matter who. So they'll say whoever I'm supporting is fine. I'm gonna fight for that person but we're gonna unite and win against Donald Trump. But the more polls you see where Senator Harris can beat Trump, the more polls you see where Senator Warren can beat Trump, and not just Biden can beat Trump. It makes them more electable, and I think undercuts the idea that Joe Biden is the only one electable. And the more that happens, I think the more Joe Biden potentially slides. He could still be the nominee, but potentially slides. 
- Putting aside the fact that Dean Obeidallah brought up the battle in which George Washington used his fighter planes to bomb the British front line during that first battle to take over the airports during the Revolutionary War, we're gonna put that aside for a moment. We're gonna come back to politics for a minute Maya Wiley, because the other issue here too is that because as Dean said, it's been seen as Biden's the only one who can beat Trump. Because there has been this idea even among African-Americans that it's gotta be a white guy. It's the only guy who can beat Trump. But when you see her beat him in a debate, doesn't that make people kinda wonder well wait a minute, if he can't beat her maybe this woman actually is the one who can take Donald Trump down. 
- Yeah, I think that's right. I think one of the things that's happening here is, this is sort of a national trauma around Donald Trump having won the 2016 election. Remember that Hillary Clinton did win by almost three million votes. Then what she lost was the electoral college and she lost that by basically three states in the Midwest. It was Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan and so that's where the, oh we-need-a-white-man fear comes from, but I also think the fact that voters voted for Donald Trump despite his overt sexism is part of why we are starting to hear what I think is a very dangerous debate about is a woman electable? And what we don't talk, as much about is, is a black woman electable? Because I think part of what's happening is this notion that the only way we win the office is by actually sacrificing who we are when all of the fundamentals show that absolutely women and women of all races are electable. That's what 2018 taught us and back to your earlier point Joy about Barack Obama, once he won the Iowa caucuses, he was way behind Hillary Clinton in the polls, way behind. When he beat her by what, about eight points in the Iowa caucus in '08, suddenly he was electable. So I think, it is early, I agree with everything everyone else has said, I think we have to address the fact that our fear could be our worst enemy. In terms of getting the kind of leader we need for the country. 
- Can I tap into that and just say Joy, just really quickly to Maya's point. I think she's right, that some people voted for Donald Trump despite these things but we also have to reconcile with the fact that a lot of people voted for this president because of these things and we still see a lot of ugly rhetoric coming out of the right and we have to remember, these guys are not running against Donald Trump right now. They're running against each other and so we have to get through a primary. So I take Dean's point, that yeah, obviously Kamala Harris is electable and it is something that voters should pay attention to. She handled Joe Biden on that stage and whether you're a supporter of hers or not, I think there is this underbelly of people who are just really dying to see her body Donald Trump on a debate stage and dying to see her slap him around on the debate stage which she could probably handle very well, probably better than some of the other candidates. But, who's doing the asking? Who's saying, is a woman electable? Who's saying is a black woman electable? And when you look at the people who are questioning that they frequently don't look like some of us on the panel. So I think, and sometimes they do. Sometimes there are people out of South Carolina who really do think that black people can be, we can question ourselves in a way that sometimes not even white people question. 
- Yeah, I mean to Tiffany's-
- 
- And to add to that point, go on, go on, go on! 
- Yeah I mean to Tiffany's point which I think is excellent, that's why this has to be about expanding the base. Expanding the electorate. Not about how many Trump voters can be peeled off. But where are the '08 and 2012 Obama voters? And that means this conversation that oftentimes the political class talks about with low-propensity voters but we like to talk about as high-potential voters. The black folks and the people of color and young people who oftentimes never get talked to. Who is gonna inspire those voters to turn out? Because if actually we can expand the base of voters and turn out people that have otherwise not turned out in the last election and don't turn out oftentimes in elections, we not only win elections, but we win with the type of base that allows us govern in progressive ways. To pass the type of legislation and the type of policy and practice change that these candidates are actually talking about. And so to the point of both the conversation about who's having this conversation in the media and how the media is covering this but also who these candidates are talking to. This has to be a story about not just appealing to the lowest common denominator but appealing to the aspirations and expanding the base of voters and that's why new voices and voices that are unafraid, women people of color are gonna be so important to usher in the Democratic Party into the next phase. 
- Yeah absolutely, Democratic Party has to decide that they have to sort of, do a sort of kind of a nostalgia version of themselves in order to mollify a certain kind of voter or do they go forward, I don't know. The women seem to be leading that conversation at the moment, Maya Wiley, Rashad Robinson, thank you very much. Tiffany and Dean, we'll be right back. And coming up, we're gonna talk Biden and whether this past week was a glitch or was it the first hole that the iceberg ripped into the side of the Titanic, that's next.

- I was prepared for them to come after me but I wasn't prepared for the person coming at me the way she came at, she knew Beau, she knows me. 
- It was the most dramatic breakout moment of the first Democratic debate. Senator Kamala Harris, the only black candidate on the Democratic debate stage, confronting former vice president Joe Biden for boasting about working with notoriously racist segregationist senators in past decades and for his stance on busing, as a means of integrating the public school system. On Friday, Biden did an interview on CNN trying to clean up on aisle six. 
- I think if you take a look, our positions aren't any different as we're finding out. 
- You were not in favor of busing. It was a different time, there were different applications. Why not just own it and say-
- 
- Oh by the way, here's the thing-
- 
- I was against it, but now I've changed. 
- I was in favor of busing that was de jure busing. Look, the question is how do you equalize education in every area? And I put forward the most aggressive plan to do that and I've been pushing it for a long time. 
- Tiffany Cross and Dean Obeidallah are back with me. And now joining is Will Bunch of the Philadelphia Inquirer and Will I want to talk to you about this because Biden is now being compared to Jeb Bush. Gail Collins wrote a piece in which she said that Biden, she worried that he would prove to be the Jeb Bush of the 2020 cycle. On Thursday he seemed uncertain, unprepared, and I think this was a bit cold, she said feeble, it undermines the core promise of his candidacy which is that he's the guy who can beat Trump. Another performance like this one and he's done but I think more importantly, what you're seeing from Biden is that he does seem to be a candidate geared toward the past. He's saying I'm gonna bring the past you liked which is the Obama era. He doesn't feel like a candidate of the future. Is that a problem for him in this race? 
- I think so, absolutely. I was at his announcement in Philadelphia and I thought people were partying like it was 2015. He wants to go back to the near past, to the Obama years. And I think after everything that's happened the last three or four years, I think people are looking for a new direction forward. I have to say in that soundbite you played where he said he wasn't expecting the Kamala Harris moment. That's really surprising to me. He's really had 40 years to prepare for it. He could tell a good story about his evolution on Civil Rights up to the point where he became the vice president to the first black president in this country and he really fumbled the answer to where he was mumbling something about states rights which, it reminded me of the launch of Ronald Reagan's 1980 campaign in Mississippi. And I think the broader problem though is, Joe Biden has been on the defensive since the day he entered this race. And I think Democratic voters are really looking for affirmative reasons to support a candidate. And I think that's why you were seeing Elizabeth Warren rise so much in the polls because she's put out plan after plan and become a hashtag, I have a plan for that. And Biden really hasn't countered that with any plans or policies that, I know he has some but they haven't really captured the public imagination. And, last night there was a new video of him that was making the rounds where a voter in Iowa confronted him about what he was gonna do about Brett Kavanaugh in the Supreme Court. And he basically spent 90 seconds telling her he didn't have a plan for that either. And that's a tough issue. A lot of the candidates don't have a good answer for that, I think. But I think, again and again, if you're going to see Joe Biden either trying to defend his past record or trying to justify his candidacy beyond just he thinks he can beat Donald Trump, you're gonna see him continue to erode in the polls if that's his style and that's the way he campaigns. 
- Yeah, I mean Tiffany there's something about even that. The thing that Will just mentioned, about him saying that, he also said he'd nominate Merrick Garland, which is also going backwards and saying I'm gonna go get that guy who's like a sort of moderate, that even when President Obama nominated him, people sort of shrugged until Mitch McConnell said no to him. Does Biden, and listen, the reality is, Democrats love Joe Biden. Let's just be honest, Democrats love Uncle Joe, but is that enough of a reason to nominate him to be president? Does he need a forward looking strategy that isn't just you love me, I'm Uncle Joe. 
- And if voters are concerned, we wanna vote for the person, who can beat Donald Trump, if Joe Biden was not prepared for this moment on busing, what will he not be prepared for when he's on the debate stage with Donald Trump? And this is a legitimate question that people have to ask themselves. And listen, it is not enough in today's society in a post-Trump America for you to say, no, no, no but wait, my best friend was black, I served the first black president and let me go through this clumsy explanation on how I came to some of these policy positions. That is not going to resonate with voters particularly, we saw in the midterms this surge in younger voters who were younger people during the Obama administration who are paying more attention in this legislative environment now. Some people's political positions. So, I think he has a lot of work to do to resonate with voters and you have to also look like, we know some of the people who work on Joe Biden's staff. It's like nobody, did you all not have during debate prep did you not think that question would come up? And why this topic is even being discussed in the first place, is because he started out by saying listen guys, I can work with segregationists. I can work with white supremacists because I've done it before. And I don't think a lot of people are looking for you to work with these people. People are looking for you to get these people out root and stem and redefine what this government should be and could be for all people including people of color who've been disenfranchised for decades. 
- Yeah, and let me play you what Biden said. Dean I wanna play this for you. This is Joe Biden talking on CNN when he did this interview with Chris Cuomo about that moment with Kamala Harris. 
- I think it'd be great to have a female VP. And if I don't win it'd be great to have a female president. 
- Do you think a Democrat ticket can win without a woman in one of the two slots? 
- Yeah well, the answer is yes, but I think it helps having a woman on the ticket. And there's a lot of really qualified women out there. 
- So that makes the point a little bit because it does talk about him saying, yeah, it'd be great to have a female VP. Again saying maybe in the future, it'd be great to have a woman VP and eventually but here's now, this cut one from my producers. This is him actually speaking about how he felt about being confronted by Kamala Harris. This is cut one. 
- It was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country. And it was not only that but you also worked with them to oppose busing. 
- Sorry about that, okay I didn't have the cut that I was looking for. The one I wanted to play for you, and I'll just describe it to you Dean. Is that he says to Chris Cuomo, that it was hurtful to him to be confronted that way by Kamala Harris. He said, She knows my son, she knows my family. Something about that, I think as a person of color maybe hearing it, it feels like he feels like he's done so much. I don't know, it felt as if he felt that he shouldn't be questioned in a sense because he's been Barack Obama's VP, that he shouldn't be questioned. 
- Well on some level to me, and that could be part of it, it hearkens back to what we were talking about. Joe Biden is a throwback to a different time where you like someone in politics, they won't attack you. They're my friend. And to remind people, 2016, in the California primary for Senate, President Obama and Joe Biden supported Kamala Harris in that primary and he campaigned for her. And so he knows his son as well, so he was stunned that someone who is my friend on the stage, in front of everyone would mock me. And that goes back, criticize me based on policy and I think that goes back to an older view of politics frankly where, hey we're all friends. We're only slightly different from each on policy. We can all get along and that's not gonna work any more today in 2020. I think Joe Biden time and time again reminds us of why in 2008, he got less than 1% of the vote in Iowa before he dropped out of the race. He was not a great candidate. He may have been a great vice president, I think he was. He might know the policies inside and out. As a candidate he's not proving himself and we need someone truly that's gonna inspire people to go in the rain and knock on doors, to drive their friends to the polls, to make phone calls, to donate money. And Joe Biden is gonna pick up his game to be that person. It's just not gonna work, I was the vice president, I'm inevitable, give me this position. Not gonna happen in 2020, I can assure you that he still could be the nominee but it's not inevitable. That's changed the game from the first debate. 
- Will very quickly, last word to you on this. Is Biden running too much on saying essentially that he wants to be the president, does he need to make a clear reason why he wants to be a president other than what he's done in the past? Because it does feel like his candidacy really is rooted in a thing where he's like I've done all this for you in the past, now it's time for me to be president. 'cause it doesn't sound like a real strong, I don't know, what do you think? 
- Are you asking me Joy? 
- Well people are-
- 
- The reality, I'm sorry. 
- People know, yeah people know-
- 
- [Joy] For will, for Will sorry. 
- Yeah that's okay. If people wanna know what he's going to do, also in his announcement, he says you wanna do something about climate change, beat Donald Trump, that's how you do something about climate change. And on one level of course that's right, but I think people wanna hear much more. You have other candidates like Jay Inslee with much more detailed plans and when he talks about Merrick Garland, Merrick Garland is a perfect reminder of why the congenial approach from the 1970s, that he wants to bring back, just isn't gonna work in the 21st century. How could somebody who was there for Merrick Garland and what Mitch McConnell did to him, think that he can get along with Republicans anyway. They had a policy of eight years of trying to not get anything for Obama, to deny him a second term and then to deny him a Supreme Court seat. And why that would suddenly change with the installation of Joe Biden as president, I just don't see that at all. 
- Yeah, I'm not sure that you can beat massive resistance with committee, it's hard. It's a hard argument to make. Dean and Tiffany will be back later in the show. Will Bunch, welcome to this show, we'll have you back on again, thank you very much. And coming up, after multiple indictments, over 10000 lies and bowing to dictators across the globe Donald Trump has seen exactly one elected Republican quit their party.

- Why is this potentially such a big deal? 
- We have more breaking news, why wouldn't we? Its Tuesday in Washington. 
- The wall is a sticking point, not border security. 
- Although the promise was a wall paid for by Mexico. 
- I cannot wait to keep talking about 2020. I gotta tell you, I think it's fascinating. 
- Your entire business is profiting off of other's people's information. Then your job, is to keep that information safe. 
- I was hoping to set an example for people. I've been involved in party politics for a while and I believe very strongly that it's hurting our country at this point. And I think people need to stand up for what's right. Stand up for what they believe in. Be independent of these party loyalties that really divide is. 
- That is former and that is right, former Republican Congressman Justin Amash on why he decided to leave the party. Choosing, you guessed it, the 4th of July to celebrate his independence. Amash was the only sitting Republican Member of Congress to support impeaching Donald Trump. He explained his decision to quit the party entirely in a Washington Post op-ed. Saying quote, true to George Washington's fears, Americans have allowed government officials under assertions of expediency and party unity to ignore the most basic tenets of our constitutional order. Separation of powers, federalism and the rule of law. The result has been the consolidation of political power and the near-disintegration of representative democracy and back with me, Daily Beast columnist Dean Obeidallah. Also joining Noelle Nikpour, Republican strategist and Jason Johnson, the Republican Jason Johnson, not the journalist Jason Johnson who is the consultant and former senior advisor to Senator Ted Cruz, so people don't think that we introduced the wrong person 'cause there are two of you guys. All right, so let me go to you first Dean. The reason I wanted to keep you here is you actually know this guy. Tell us a little bit about him, because he is an interesting character. Interesting person. 
- Well I met him once. 
- I shouldn't say character, interesting Guy. 
- We have a lot of mutual friends. What I do admire a great deal that it took the son of a Palestinian refugee to be the first one to stand for impeachment and I said that as the son of a Palestinian refugee myself, and when I met him, I was the MC out of an Arab-American event in DC where he was being honored years ago and it wasn't partisan. But let's be clear about one thing. Donald Trump called him a disloyal Republican. This is a guy, Justin, who is a founder of the Freedom Caucus. This is a guy who's got a higher rating from the American Conservative Union, higher than Lindsey Graham. But to Donald Trump it's not about loyalty to the Republican Party, or conservative principles, it's loyalty to one person, Donald J. Trump. So, this congressman refused to be loyal to him. It's not loyalty to the party. And Justin's put the constitution above his party before and now he's put his party to the side, said I stand up for the United States of America and I'm against partisan politics that's become toxic, so I applaud for him that. 
- Very quickly, he's Syrian and Palestinian. One parent is Syrian-
- 
- I'm only half Arab, he's 100% Arab. I'm a 1/2 Arab guy, he's a pure out there. So I think it's probably shocked a lot of Republicans. 
- And you know Noelle Nikpour, it used to be, back you know, I'm old enough to remember when a plurality if not a majority of people who are Arab-American in particular were Republicans. Were sort of geared toward the Republican Party. There's been a huge exit of the party by people of that record. And he's not for that reason, his piece in the Washington Post I thought was brilliant. He really explained where we are in terms of hyper partisanship just eroding our politics and that's really on one side more than the other to be honest with you. The Republican Party said that Barack Obama essentially doesn't exist as president. We will make him not exist. The fact that he's left, what does it mean and why is he the only one Noelle? 
- Well, you know in my opinion I think it was a wrong move that he left the Republican Party because although he doesn't like President Donald Trump, he does respect the platform of the Republican Party. In my opinion, you really can't make change and you really can't make a difference if you just quit. You just quit the party because you don't like who's representing the party. You've got an opportunity while you're in the party to get other people to convince them of making change with policy. Really the way you make change is in policy not by quitting because I know he's not gonna go on the other side and join the Democrat party. So it just leaves him to be an Independent and the likelihood of him getting reelected is probably not good. So therefore, I wish that he would have stayed and made his case and really fought for what he believed in and tried to change the direction of the course versus just quitting it. 
- First of all, it's Democratic Party, we have to do that, that is one rule on the show. We don't use sort of the fake names the Democratic Party, we're gonna go with Democratic Party. I'm gonna go to you Jason, because the thing that he is, okay let's say he loves the tax cuts for the rich, okay. That he likes the Republican thing. I don't know he could like the kids in cages but maybe let's say he likes that too. What he specifically has a problem with is breaking the law. This guy has been very clear. He actually read the Mueller report. He's one of the few in Congress that's actually read it. He read it and said oh, this guy violated 10 times, the law that if he was a civilian he'd be in prison for obstructing justice. If you can't be for the president of the United States, having to actually uphold the law he swears to uphold I'm not sure what your purpose is as a politician. So doesn't he get credit for actually believing enough in the rule of law to say this guy violated, I'm outta here. 
- So Joy, two things. Number one I'm not going to sit here and try to argue that Justin Amash's exit from the Republican Party and declaring himself an Independent is detached and has nothing to do with his calling for impeachment of the president. Clearly there's a direct correlation. At the same time, I think it's very important and I know it's tempting to only get wrapped up in the Donald Trump portion. If you read that editorial, I too thought it was brilliant. I agreed with almost every word within that editorial because the reality is long before Donald Trump came along, this hyper partisanship, I mean, think about what was just said a moment ago by Noelle. Why should Justin Amash, a member today elected by his district of the House of Representatives be any less effective in arguing for his brand of constitutional conservatism simply because he doesn't have an R next to his name? Now I'm not saying that he won't be less effective, in fact he will, but that in of itself, sort of makes the point with the problem that we have today. You either are on team red or team blue and I think we all know that unfortunately we listen or we're open-minded to the arguments presented based upon the color of the other person's jersey and that's unfortunate, it shouldn't be that way. 
- Yeah, and then to that point Noelle, answer that. Because it's true, if you're saying he still believes in the principles of conservatism then you mean if he takes off team red, suddenly he is not a person who should legitimately be reelected. If people agree with what he's for why shouldn't he get reelected as an Independent? 
- Well I mean, I feel like that we have turned politics into a bloodsport. 
- [Joy] But aren't you doing that, by saying that if he takes off the red jersey, suddenly he can't get reelected, why shouldn't he? 
- Because it's going to be hard to raise money. That's number one and if you have turned your back on the GOP, he said he was quitting the GOP, he didn't say he was quitting Donald Trump. He could've said maybe I'm quitting team Trump. I don't agree with that. He said he's quitting the GOP! 
- But how do you quit team Trump? Wait hold on, hold on one second. Wait a second, Donald Trump is the GOP. Donald Trump is the head of the Republican Party. All of the policies, that Donald Trump is putting in place, your party 100% is standing behind him on. Whether it's the children in cages, which violates all kinds of laws and maybe the Geneva Convention. They're behind him on tariffs, which are destroying people's farms and ranches. Destroying their lives. They're behind him on everything he does, even if he's saying I'm going to ignore the Supreme Court. If no one has quit over that, Charlottesville, nothing else, does the guy get credit for saying he has some principle. At some point he says enough. 
- He totally gets credit for being his own man and standing up for things that he doesn't believe in or agree with, but to quit the party. The Republican Party platform is not Donald Trump. It's a platform-
- 
- But it is! But it is, no yes it is. It is Donald Trump, it is. It's 100% Donald Trump. It's whatever he wants he does it. Whatever Donald Trump wants that's the platform. 
- But he ran under the GOP label. But the GOP didn't run on his label or his brand. So in effect-
- 
- So then the kids in cages are the Republican platform? 
- Well, I just feel like, back to the original point, I just feel like for him to try to do a reelection campaign, raising money, trying to depend on major GOP donors to help get his message out, I think that it's gonna be really hard. I just don't see him getting reelected when he quits the Republican Party, trying to, what are you gonna run, I guess you're gonna run as an Independent and where are you gonna get the funding sources for that? There's not a lot of-
- 
- It's all about money. Let me give Jason the last word. Jason will there be more, will there be other Justin Amash's in your view. 
- Well I would assume go forward. Again, because this started long before Donald Trump. We will see more members. It's amazing, out of 435 elected representatives in the people's house there now is only one Independent. We hear all the time, about how at least 1/3 of the country is in fact Independent, yet there's one out of 435. Go forward and this surprised both parties. Unless the political parties which are coalitions of policy demanders, start to respond to their bases and then work with one another, beyond just the brand on the actual issues, I do believe we will see more individuals declaring their Independent candidacy go forward. 
- Last word to you Dean Obeidallah. If he ran as an Independent, would Democrats support him? 
- They might 'cause they came out to his town hall-
- 
- Despite his policy differences? 
- He got a standing ovation. But let's be, it's about, the GOP is about loyalty to Donald Trump only. It stands for nothing. The GOP is Trump and Trump is the GOP. It's a party, not team red, it's team Trump. And not one Republican stood up for Justin when Trump said he's disloyal. He's not disloyal to Republican values, he's disloyal to Donald Trump. And that dictator-in-chief demanded he be gone. 
- I recommend everybody read, not Jason Johnson actually, read Justin Amash's piece in the Washington Post, it's quite good. Dean Obeidallah, Noelle Nikpour, Jason Johnson, thank you all very much. Coming up, the freak out, the freak out over a teenage mermaid and what it tells us about America's culture war, is next.

- Voice of Disney's newest Ariel, Halle Bailey who is set to star in the live action Little Mermaid remake. Well now, here's where you may wanna have any kids under 12 leave the room. I'm gonna give you a moment, take a moment, take 'em out of the room. Okay, so mermaids aren't real. I know, they're not real. So in theory, anyone could play a mermaid, right? Wrong! The announcement of Ariel's casting has caused a multi-day freak out amongst some Disney fans who are upset that the actress cast to play Ariel is not white. Back with me is Tiffany Cross of The Beat DC and joining me now, entertainment journalist Chris Witherspoon. Okay Chris, I gotta go to you first. Because like, this seemed like a perfectly adorable wonderful thing, she is adorable, the young lady who's going to play Ariel. She tweets out dream come true, animated picture of an African-American there. People are excited that you're gonna have this cute little African-American girl being Ariel, but the freak out was real. Not my Ariel trended, I think it trended for a couple of days after this happened and people were screaming she's supposed to be white with red hair, what the H. What is going on? 
- You know, I'm giving you eye rolls right now because I was shocked by the freak out myself and a lot of the folks that were freaking out were white adults who grew up with Little Mermaid that came on at like maybe nine. They had this white depiction of a princess that we have seen for decades. And I think that the freak out is unwarranted. The reality is that there have been 11 Disney princesses. Guess how many of them have been black, just one. So 91% of the sort of depiction and the narrative of what it is to be a princess has been through this white lens. So it's past due. And the last time that we had a black princess was 10 years ago. So calm down, have several seats and let's embrace Halle and all of her talent. That clip just showcased, she is fierce. And she deserves this role, hands down. 
- It's interesting... Let me just read one tweet and thank you to my team for putting this up there, 'cause I think this sort of made the point very well. This is a woman named Stephanie Renee. Who says my children were raised with Ariel. She's an icon in the eyes of many children and adults of today, okay. To change her race is absurd. That would be like someone making a movie about Oprah Winfrey and hiring a white girl to play Oprah, Oprah is an icon. We wouldn't want to change her. Okay, first of all Oprah Winfrey is a real person so if you made a movie about her, you'd want her to look kinda like Oprah. This isn't a documentary. There is no such person as Ariel, it's not a person-
- 
- And there is no time-
- 
- She's just a fictional character. 
- There is no time under the sea where Sebastian says Ariel and your whiteness and your Caucasian experience, it doesn't happen. So we could easily recreate and retell this story however we see fit. And I think Disney is doing a great job at being inclusive and finding ways to tell diverse narratives and do colorblind casting. 
- It's really interesting. Tiffany, I'm gonna come to you on this because when Malcolm X was made and I thought the movie was brilliant and this was the Spike Lee film, I had a slight problem, with just the casting of Malcolm X, brilliant, Denzel Washington is a genius, he can play anything but he's darker skin and having light skin was like part of Malcolm X's character. Like you know what I mean? So if you look at something like that, you're saying okay maybe the casting was odd because his whole personality had to partly do with his complexion. But this isn't a documentary. It's about a fictional pretend creature that's actually a fish. 
- And even to the crazy lady who's tweeting out the tweet you just read, how many white people have actually played real black people? You have white actors play Michael Jackson and other people. How often do our stories get whitewashed in mainstream Hollywood, so this is so ridiculous. Honestly Joy, I have a theory. I think that not my Ariel thing trended briefly because of those fringe internet section comments crazy people who tweet out this ridiculous things but I think the overwhelming majority of people who made this trend, were people who disagreed, who were saying how ridiculous you all sound saying this is not my Ariel and this goes back to the Megyn Kelly comments that Santa is white. And we could even look at the Disney princesses and they all look the same even among the white princesses, they all look the same. There's never been a disabled princess. There's never been an overweight princess, so there are so many areas where we can grow and learn in these spaces and to your point, it is a cartoon character you idiots, like what are you upset about? You sound so ridiculous. 
- I never disagree with anything that Tiffany says but Santa is real, his name is Larry, we've had him on the show twice. So I'm just saying, Santa's real. Don't play with me with Santa, 'cause I met him. 
- Can I say about Halle Bailey, this girl is so talented. Her and her sister they write music, the understand music, they're part of the Beyonce family which you know I'm the honorary president of the Beyonce fan club-
- 
- Come through, can I be the vice president? 
- So anything she touches is, well Chris you're my honorary co-chair of the Beyonce fan club. 
- Thank you. 
- She's so talented and if there's one sad thing to be taken away of this, it's that her joy was taken away because of these fringe, crazy people tweeting these things. 
- And I think that the finger pointing, if there is any in this scenario it should really go towards Hollywood and the fact that over the past, since 1937 and Disney films, we've seen Snow White and Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and they've all kind of looked the same as you said Tiffany. So I think it's high time that Hollywood begins to embrace and open doors and allow creatives that have these stories to tell, they can create new stories. Maybe it's not gonna be Ariel, maybe it's gonna be an actual black princess who lives in Harlem or Brooklyn. 
- Yep, there you go! 
- We need to see more and new stories, or more new stories. 
- And by the way the people sort of overall, this comes to the overall trauma that people are feeling about the changes in the culture and that the culture doesn't look like them anymore that they're not in the center. This is all a bigger picture, so we wanna talk about this today. 
- Well we aint going back. We aint going back. 
- 'cause there is a bigger picture, yes absolutely. Thank you guys, Tiffany Cross, Chris Witherspoon, you guys go have your meeting about Beyonce, I'll call into it later? 
- We'll Skype you in.
