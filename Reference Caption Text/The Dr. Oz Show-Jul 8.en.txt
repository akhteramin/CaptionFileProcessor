- [Narrator] Microwave breakfasts. 
- [Dr. Oz] Omelet cups, burritos, and egg muffins. 
- [Narrator] Fast, easy. 
- When it comes to frozen food, breakfast foods are queen. 
- [Narrator] But are they really good for you? 
- Or are they just junk food in disguise? 
- [Narrator] Plus, fat shamers. 
- [Woman] I can't sit here because they're both so big. 
- [Narrator] Caught on tape. 
- [Man] She's eating too much chocolate. 
- [Woman] Why are you insulting me about my weight? 
- [Narrator] Coming up next. 
- Y'all ready for season 10? 
- [Crowd] Yeah! 
- I love you, Dr. Oz. 
- Today, an investigation into a giant shift happening in your frozen food aisle. The food industry is offering an unprecedented number of microwavable frozen breakfast food options, including your favorites, breakfast sandwiches, delicious looking omelet cups, burritos and egg muffins, all hot and ready in minutes. Many even claim to be healthier, but are they, or are they just junk food in disguise? Investigator and mom of two, Mara Schiavocampo, put many of these options to the test in the best food lab there is, her own busy kitchen. 
- Okay so, I'm shopping for breakfast sandwiches. I can't remember the last time I bought a breakfast sandwich. So this should be interesting. Hey quesadilla. Do you wanna try these for breakfast? 
- Um, what are they? 
- [Mara] It's a breakfast sandwich made on a waffle. It's bacon, egg, and cheese. 
- I don't really like eggs or cheese, but I could try with something else. Maybe just bacon? 
- [Mara] So, this is what I ended up getting. We have two different English muffins. They are different. This one is like on a waffle and this is a breadless egg cup which I am very excited about. 
- Mara, be honest, was that the best assignment you have ever been given? 
- You know, any assignment that involves tasting food, I'm in, sign me up for it. 
- [Dr. Oz] And your daughter's already an investigative reporter. 
- She's very discerning, yeah. You know, breakfast is a really hard meal for me. I was really happy to get this assignment because this is tough for me. I'm a low carb eater. So I'm always looking for portable, low carb options, and with my kids, I'm looking for alternatives to the staples that are high sugar, high carb, like cereal and pancakes. So this could change things in my house. 
- And how big have these products become now, these microwavable breakfasts? 
- When it comes to frozen food, breakfast foods are doing so well. Really it's for two reasons. One is millennials. So, 82% of millennials say that this is a good option for their kids and case in point, I agree with that completely. The other one is the keto crowd. Keto is huge right now. They're looking for low carb options. Those two things are driving this industry. 
- Yeah, they use, the bun is actually egg. 
- And it looks so delicious. 
- It does look good. All right, that's a start. So we asked food scientist, Taylor, and he's a fanatic, by the way, about breakfast foods. Taylor Wallace to be here to break down exactly how microwavable breakfasts are made. Let's start with the prime ingredient of all, the egg. Is there a real egg in these microwavable breakfasts? Crack the egg for me. 
- So actually, yes. Many of these products, the main ingredient is a whole egg. Now, also in these products, you're gonna see some of your other normal culprits, different food additives. Now, they might look scary but they're all in there for a functional purpose, right? So for instance, it looks scary. Xanthan gum, that's just a dietary fiber that we add to food. We add it to eggs because we don't want the egg to crumble when you bite into it and fall into your lap. Modified corn starch, that just provides a little bit of texture to the product. And then you have all these different flavors and you might ask, well why not just add butter? Because butter oxidizes and makes the product go stale. So, instead, we add these flavors that won't oxidize and produce a bad taste. 
- Well you just expressed a bias. I love that it's a real egg. I sorta wish I didn't have to add all these things in there but I know you guys have other technologies. We have a way of making the frozen, microwavable breakfast flavorful and locking in that flavor and it has to do with this, and you're a flavor scientist, so what does this have to do with flavor? 
- So, there's two main things that you have to worry about in products like egg sandwiches. One is water because we know water makes things go bad, and two is oxygen because oxygen oxidizes things. So what do we do? We freeze the water because frozen water can't do much and then we add nitrogen to the bag or to the package. So, very similar to what you see in potato chips. If you buy a bag of potato chips with all the air inside, that's nitrogen. When you open then bag, then the oxygen comes in. You leave it out for a day and it goes stale. The same thing happens with egg sandwiches. 
- All right, so let's take a look at different types of frozen breakfasts that we find at the grocery store. I took that list that you just got Mara, that treasure trove and I split it out, and I know that there's a big keto move. So explain how people have hacked that system. 
- Yeah, so just as a reminder, it's very, very high fat, very low carb. So when you take a look at these traditional breakfast sandwiches here, these are not gonna be an option for keto followers because of the bread. But when you look over here, this is really a game changer if you're keto devotee. They have made the bread out of eggs. So this is breadless. It's essentially, two egg patties-
- 
- I saw that, I wasn't sure if that was real. 
- It's real, it's eggs, it is high protein. It is extremely low carb. 
- So egg bun. 
- Yeah, so this is the industry responding to that demand. They have heard loud and clear what low carb dieters want. 
- All right, so seven grams of carbs. How do the rest of your options compare? 
- Yeah so you can see it's a big difference. So the English muffin option, 28 grams of carbs, so I've never been good at math but I think that's four times the amount, right, roughly. 
- You're better than you say. It's exactly four times it. 
- And here we have the croissant, 27 grams, pretty much the same. The biscuit, which to me looks like the most delectable, delicious one. 
- [Dr. Oz] I think that's a pretty good deal. 
- Oh my goodness, I'm working hard not to take a bite. 
- But this is intriguing to me. Flatbread's a good idea. 
- Flatbread is a great idea. You see that it is the lowest carb of all of them but still much higher than the breadless one. 
- Now you tasted these and you had that discerning of you taste as well. How did this breadless version do? 
- It was absolutely delicious. I did not miss the bread at all. But I did have to wonder, is that too much protein? Am I overdoing it? 
- I looked into it, I think the protein's okay. The bigger concern for me is salt. Sometimes in order to make it flavorful, because when you freeze things it doesn't taste the same always. They can have more salt than you want. So just take a look at that. But overall I was impressed that you had this many options. But I wanna go to our audience member here, 'cause the next microwavable frozen breakfast investigation had to do with the crustless quiches. There's no carbs in a crustless quiche. Do I have this right? 
- [Lisa] Yes. 
- Well I wanna do a thing. Compare these two and see if you taste the difference. Mara, you can go do it as well, here. 
- Oh thank you, I thought you'd never ask. 
- Exactly. I figured you eat them all at home before you got here. I'm gonna reveal something to you in a second, but these are not quite made the same way. So, which do you like more of these? 
- This one's much better. 
- Much better? 
- Mhmm. All right, so I'm just gonna reveal something to you. One of these is actually homemade, by yours truly. And the other one was made in a store. This was made by us. 
- [Lisa] Nice job, Dr. Oz. 
- [Mara] Oh wow. 
- This is the store bought one. I only point it out because this didn't take a ton of time. I think most people prefer it, but I get why you don't do it. It's a lack of time. Does this taste good enough that if you didn't have time to make that on your own you'd still be okay with it? 
- Yeah I'd be okay with it. 
- All right, so it works. 
- Yeah, it's a great option. 
- You pick and choose what you want, I don't think it's quite the same as making it yourself but it's probably good enough for most, especially busy moms out there. How do they compare nutritionally? 
- So it's actually, there's a lot of good news here. These have, the store bought ones, are real egg or egg base, which is just basically liquid egg. Now they do have other things added in because they do have to live on a shelf, they do have to be frozen. But for the most part it is very close to the real thing. You can feel good about eating them and giving them to your kids. 
- Show off at home, Lisa. All right, me, one last stop. We invested frozen microwave breakfast burritos. Taylor these have been getting a lot of criticism over the years, but they seem to be making a comeback. 
- Right, you know, when I was a kid, it was like these things are terrible, right? I mean they're mushy and gooey and not great. Food scientists have this down to an art and now, just like over there, they taste fantastic. And not only that, there's vegetarian options, there's farm to table options. We've got something for everybody. 
- So you still wanna watch the sodium on these, especially if you got pressure issues. We always say make bacon a special food, so you don't want to have that every day either. Maybe twice a week kinda thing. When we come back we show you a brand new microwavable breakfast that allows you to use your own fresh egg. Is it the best of both worlds? We'll find out when we come back.

- If you have ever tried to make an omelet and this happens, right, you're not alone. Guess what, restaurants, the best places in the world, using making an omelet as the ultimate test of a chef's true skill. So I didn't pass this time, but I'm getting better. I can cover it up. I can stitch this back together again. I got the stick knowledge. Anyway, today we're investigating a brand new shortcut turning omelets into a weekday quickie meal using your own microwave. These are called omelets in a cup. Now food scientist Taylor Wallace is here to help us figure out what's really in these. There's too many kinds of omelets in a cup. Break them up for us. 
- Okay, so your first kind, go ahead and open that package, and what you'll see, it's got everything inside. So you've got your little vegetables and meat. And then you have a liquid egg, so go on and check it out. And a liquid egg is basically the same thing that you buy in the grocery store in those milk carton-like jugs. It's just been pasteurized a little bit more than the old way to prevent bacteria from growing. 
- So pour it in here? 
- Yep, so pour it right in. You can pop it in the microwave and you're ready to go basically. 
- [Dr. Oz] Put my fixings in there, I'm good to go. 
- [Taylor] Absolutely. 
- It's so easy, so simple. So how is yours different? 
- So the second one, this is for consumers that prefer their products a little less processed. So we charge 'em the same price but don't add the egg, you have to add your own. 
- You're kidding me, it's the same price? 
- Right, and instead of the egg you have to add your own and it's not a liquid egg. So if you see, you've got the cheese, the vegetables, the meat in there, same thing as in your other product. 
- Break the egg. You have to break it on plastic. Oh my goodness. Here, break it over here, and put it in the pan, there. All right. That's it. And you add the goodies in there. 
- [Taylor] Then you add the stuff, mix it up, and there you go. 
- I gotta say I'm impressed. This is actually so close to what I would normally wanna do, I'd probably think about this. 
- Right, and like Mara said, they're very close to the normal food product that you would cook in your kitchen. Got a little bit of additives in there to help prevent mold growth or bacteria growth, but overall it's the same thing. 
- A food scientist is happy, I'm happy. All right, and the price you mentioned is the same. 
- Yeah the price, I mentioned, is about $3 a pack. So great for someone like a college student or somebody like you and I that are on the go. Might not wanna feed the whole family with it 'cause that gets kind of expensive. But great on the go. 
- I gotta say, as I look at these... 
- [Announcer] This is a statement from the National Weather Service. For the following country, District of Columbia, and the following counties in Maryland, Montgomery, and Prince George's. The National Weather Service in Sterling, Virginia, has issued a flood warning for the District of Columbia, Montgomery County in Central Maryland, Prince George's County in Central Maryland, until 6 p.m at 12:40 p.m. Reporting gages and reports from emergency managers indicate flooding is ongoing across portions of Montgomery, Prince George's County, and the District of Columbia. With heavy rain now over, a flood warning has been issued to replace the flash flood warning that has been in effect.

- I know, did you start to salivate at that sound? You start to think about food when the beep starts with your microwave. Millions of you rely on quick microwave meals because it's a quick lunch or ready in minutes hot dinner. But can you get addicted to these fast food frozen foods? How does your freezer look? Does it look like this? Someone in our audience is the owner of this stocked freezer full of those microwave meals and is being turned in for their obsession with microwave meals. Please welcome Angela, who's turning in her best friend Suella. 
- Hi Dr. Oz. 
- Suella, you didn't know this was happening did you? 
- No, no. I think I'm fine. 
- [Dr. Oz] You think you're fine. What is the issue here? 
- She has a problem. She has a very big problem. 
- And that's a real photo of her freezer. 
- Yes. 
- [Dr. Oz] And how often is she eating microwave frozen food? 
- All the time. Breakfasts, lunch, snack. 
- I'm busy. 
- No, it's no. 
- I really love it. 
- No. 
- [Dr. Oz] Well what do you love about it so much? 
- Well they have healthy ones, I eat Lean Cuisine, I like hot pockets sometimes when I'm really in a rush. So you know, easy is convenient. 
- What do you think about your friend's concern over your perceived addiction towards microwave fast food? 
- I don't know what her concern is. 
- You don't know my concern? 
- No. 
- You send me coupons, you wanna buy things off Ebay. It's microwavable food. No, you go to the dollar store, you go to all of the stores. No, no, no, it's too much. 
- Pot pies, really good. 
- Let's just talk about, come on up here a little bit Suella. We got a little discussion. I understand the allure of frozen meals, but in reality, there's something that's really addictive in these foods that makes them so desirous for us. 
- And they taste good. 
- So Mark Schatzker, food journalist extraordinaire, and a real expert in the area, he's made a taste test for us that you and I are gonna be participants in. But you gotta tell the truth though. 
- All right. 
- So take us, what are we gonna taste and what kind of an organization do you have here? 
- Okay we got three lasagnas. The first one is fresh lasagna, we made this, this is like what you'd make at home. This is also lasagna we made but not fresh. We froze it, and then we reheated it. 
- Mm. That fresh is good. Keep going, I'm moving along here. 
- And then we got, this is the microwavable lasagna like you'd buy at the supermarket. 
- [Dr. Oz] This is the microwave here. 
- [Mark] There'll be something interesting here. 
- That is good. That is really good. 
- Tell me what you like about it. 
- You should have this. You'd like it. 
- Yeah it tastes real good. 
- Okay so there's something really interesting. 
- This is actually better than the fresh. 
- Better than fresh. Something really interesting happening here. So this is another tale of taste bud trickery. This is where it's in the flavor. It's in how they created this experience of lasagna in a frozen food where we're gonna find something interesting. 
- Let's uncover the anatomy of a microwave meal. How do they actually pull that off? 'Cause I do think, like you, that definitely tastes better than the frozen stuff that you made yourself. What do they do differently? So the first issue is preservatives. Mark, what kind are we talking about? 
- Okay so yeah, one thing they do to get that flavor, they use synthetic flavorings. We've talked about that before, but that's how they jack up that flavor. We also see a lot of the same guilty suspects that we see in other processed foods. There's polysorbate 80, that's a bulking agent, that makes the sauce taste nice and smooth. There's something called potassium bromate, that's a dough additive. It's actually illegal in some countries. And then we have sodium nitrite. Now we've talked about that-
- 
- [Dr. Oz] It's illegal in some countries? 
- It's illegal. And it's in our frozen foods. 
- So these are theoretical concerns, but next issue is a real concern, which is sugar. And how much sugar... Actually why would you even add sugar to lasagna? There's already pasta in there. 
- Well because, as we saw, the flavor takes a beating. So what's an easy way to jack that flavor back up? Just dump in some sugar. And you're gonna be shocked at how much. We found one frozen entree that had 29 grams of sugar in a serving. 
- Suella, do you hear that? 29 grams. 
- Okay, it gets worse, 'cause guess how big the serving is. This big. It's only half. Most people think, they pull it out of their microwave and they think I get to eat the whole thing. 
- Yes. 
- Well then you're getting 58 grams of sugar. That's the sugar that's in two candy bars. So who would ever thinking I'm nuking my dinner, there's two candy bars worth of sugar in there? It's crazy. 
- So a lot of sugar, and there's another hidden source of carbs. Modified starch. Which I don't even know what... What do you modify starch to do? 
- Yeah modified starch, what is it? Well it's there to get rid of some of the problems that you get when you reheat frozen foods, so you don't get those puddles of water, so that it holds its shape. But it's essentially carbohydrates that have no flavor. So you're getting carbs in your tummy that you don't taste on the way down, and I think that's where the worry is. 
- So stay with Mark for a sec, I'm gonna explain to everybody what happens to your brain while you're having all these empty carbs that are hidden from you. You got the brain here, you got you there. Take a bite out of one of these meals, and what ends up happening is you begin to fall in love with it, begin to crave it. Then what happens, your blood sugar starts to spike up. When the blood sugar goes up, dopamine is released from your brain which makes you really happy, smiley. We all know that, right, our comfort food. But then, over time, your blood sugar falls back down again, and you crave that high you just had. So your low blood sugar levels cause an increased appetite, right, you eat more food because the time seems like it's the right to do. And the next thing you know you eat more of those frozen meals that you've been craving and feeling okay about doing it. So Mark, you say in addition to this, which is sort of like a chemical addiction, there's a psychological addiction these microwave meals can cause. 
- Yeah, so we've seen this interaction before. You got things like foods with a lot of sugar and flavoring makes it compulsive, makes it really delicious in the moment, hard to stop eating. So I think there's a lot of ways these get us eating too much. 
- So don't be a killjoy here. If we're gonna eat our microwave, 'cause I think Suella, who's nervously laughing now, is probably gonna still eat some of the microwaves that are in her freezer. Give us some tact and some hacks. 
- Okay so one thing is to look at the ingredient list, 'cause they're not all the same. The ingredients that come at the beginning of the list, there's more of them. So look for the good things. If it's a broccoli pasta, look for broccoli at the beginning of the ingredient list. If it's at the very end, that means there's not much, and if you don't see it at all, be worried about that. 
- So Suella, I need your verdict here. Your friend, me, Professor Shasker next to us, seems to think you're probably better served to eat your microwave meals a little differently. What do you think? 
- I don't think I'll do it every day now. I think I'll do it like maybe twice, maybe three times a week. Slowly process on my addiction on it. But thank you for the advice.

- We're back with our investigation into public fat shaming. Would you know what to do if it happened to you? What about if it came from the one person you trust the most, your own doctor? According to one study, about half of women, half, say they've been shamed by a physician, with weight being one of the top reasons. Latoya says she was fat shamed by her doctor, who ignored her pain symptoms. After feeling ill, Rebecca says her doctor told her to lose weight, but turns out her health issues were not a result of her size. It was actually cancer. So Rebecca, let's talk about your case, it's pretty serious. So you go to the doctor, you're not feeling well, how did the physicians respond to the observations you were making about your own body? 
- Yeah so a lot of times it was very much a dismissal. It was kind of a dismissal of symptoms, over and over and over again. Just a well basically if you just lost a little bit of weight you'd be fine. If you just lost a bit of weight you could breathe better. We don't really know what's going on but if you just lot a bit of weight everything will be okay. 
- So after three years, three years everybody, of looking around, you finally got a diagnosis. What was really happening inside your body? 
- I had a tumor in my left main stem bronchus in my lung, and it had kind of killed the bottom half of my lung and they had to take the whole left lung out. 
- In part 'cause it took three years I think to figure out what was going on. 
- Yeah. 
- What was it like when you finally realized you actually had a life threatening problem that was causing this and not an issue with your weight, which you never thought was the problem to begin with? 
- It was the first time that like I had finally gotten a diagnosis and I had spent so much time trying to figure out what was wrong with me, and then somebody finally told me that something was wrong, and it was just so freeing to realize that there was something that was actually there, that like no I'm not just fat, something is wrong in this body. 
- So I wish you were the only person who felt the way you have stated you felt, 'cause it turns out that obese patients are 65% more likely than others to have significant undiagnosed medical conditions. We write it off, say it's something else. And sometimes it is the weight that's the problem, but oftentimes it's not. Are you feeling okay now? 
- Yeah I've been cancer free since 2012. 
- [Dr. Oz] Good for you. Good for you. 
- Thanks. Thank you. 
- Latoya, let's talk about your story. Also an example of doctors overlooking a real diagnosis. What happened? 
- Well in my case I've been in pain for the past two decades, since I started my menstruation when I was about 10 or 11. All I can remember is feeling this crippling paralyzing pain every time my menzies would come about. When I went to the doctor initially it was well how about we give you some birth control? When I started gaining, like I wanna say I started gaining weight, particularly after I had my son, it was automatically shifted to it has to be your weight. 
- So your doctors actually finally found the real diagnosis right? What was going on? 
- My real diagnosis was that I was diagnosed with endometriosis. And that wasn't found until I miscarried several times, like over, I stopped counting after four times. 
- Oh I'm sorry. 
- And it's something that so many people brush off as it's nothing. I find that's the issue in a lot of things in reproductive health. 
- Well the reason I'm passionate about this topic of fat shaming is because it can embarrass people and people can do bad things to themselves because they're shamed by. But we also miss the real diagnosis, which is a much more obvious way that we hurt people. Now I should share, Latoya's about to run her 17th marathon in three weeks. So you didn't get held back, neither of you did. What is your message to doctors who are too easily writing off symptoms to their patients being overweight? 
- Actually listen to your patients. Be patient with your patients. Essentially, don't just brush it off or just look at them and then try to give them a diagnosis. Actually do the work, look into it, do blood tests, which I've had, which proved that I didn't have some of these things that they thought that I had. Actually listen to us, because when you don't listen to us then we have a distrust, we have a worry, and a real fear that nobody is going to take us serious. It makes people not want to actually come to you and we essentially go to you to trust you, so just listen to us and know that this is not all in our heads. We know our bodies more than anybody else.

- [Female] Oh my goodness, I don't know I'm gonna do this for the next four hours. This is just impossible because they're squishing me. Like friggin', it's just unbelievable. At least they'll keep me warm. Find me a window, get me out of here. I can't breathe, I'm so squished. Well I eat salad, okay. I can't sit here because they're both so big. 
- It's pretty awkward, huh? That was a small taste of what got that passenger kicked off a recent flight. She called her seat mates big pigs among other things. Today we're exposing fat shaming caught on tape. Strangers bullying and verbally abusing others because of their weight. It's a malicious and disturbing online trend. 
- She's eating too much chocolate. 
- [Dr. Oz] Fat shaming videos. 
- Why are you insulting me about my weight? A car full of men stopped in the middle of a busy road just so they can roll down their window and say eat that ice cream you fat (bleep). 
- [Female] Oh my goodness, I don't know how I'm gonna do this for the next four hours. This is just impossible because they're squishing me. 
- [Dr. Oz] Unrestrained and hurtful comments shared in posts. 
- [Female] Well I eat salad, okay. 
- [Dr. Oz] Are leaving people outraged and shocked. 
- [Female] Can you find her another seat? 'Cause I will not be verbally abused. 
- What if I had been in such a place that you saying that to me had made me go home and kill myself? 
- [Dr. Oz] Hurt feelings, some show no mercy. 
- When you wanna dance around in your skin tight leotards with your fat rolls hanging out, and saying you should love me for my personality not my body, and you're promoting laziness and eating unhealthy, all of a sudden everyone in this world has got a (bleep) excuse why they can't be healthy. 
- [Dr. Oz] Here, former Playboy play mate Dani Mathers seems to have taken fat shaming to the extreme, posting this picture of a naked woman with the comment if I can't unsee this then you can't either. 
- [Female] You're abusing women. 
- [Female] I can't sit here because they're both so big on left and right. I can't even sit here. 
- [Male] You should be ashamed of yourself, madam. What you're dong is so terrible, you should be ashamed of yourself. 
- [Female] Why don't you sit in between those two pigs? 
- [Female] Kiss my fat (bleep) okay. 
- Looking at these videos, you have to ask yourself what drives people to such hatred? Norma, the woman who recorded that viral video of her seat mate publicly fat shaming her, joins me now. First off, thank you for coming to the show. 
- Oh thank you for having me, Dr. Oz. 
- Let's go back to what happened when you first got to your seat. 
- Getting comfortable, seated at the window seat, realizing that this woman that was coming into the middle seat was having a bad day. She wasn't a happy person. Verbally saying negative things and making it a little uncomfortable. 
- And how did it make you feel when you appreciated what she was really getting at? 
- Uncomfortable, angry, angrier, and madder. That's why I started doing the, you know, with her outbursts, I decided to go ahead and do the video. 
- And she kept going even with you recording. 
- Yes. And she knew I was recording. 
- So what prompted you to wanna post it? Because it does put you at risk too. The whole thing is so embarrassing. Of course for her, because she's doing all this stuff. 
- I guess because as a nurse and I have a platform, that I thought that bullying and body shaming is an unacceptable behavior for children and even more so for adults. So I felt the need to actually show this happening to me. 
- Good for you. A lot of people would have just pretended it never happened and then it gets tolerated. You travel a lot, have you ever been publicly, an attempt made to publicly shame you like this? 
- 15 years on the road and this was truly a first. I'm on the road almost every week and this was a first. 
- And you probably, you must have at some point been disbelieving this was even happening. 
- I did, there was a delay. But when somebody attacks you in you're in public, you can get up and walk away. You're in a plane, there's no place to walk to. You're a confined space. 
- In fact, maybe that's the reason, but the airline ultimately kicked her off. What was the reason they gave for doing that? 
- Well they were saying that there were so many people that were complaining, besides myself. When I got off the plane there were people behind me, when we got off the plane in Newark, that told me that her behavior after I stopped video taping was she was still ranting back there. So the airline had to take her off the plane for the safety of all of the passengers. 
- So we reached out to the airline, it was United Airlines, and here's what they had to say about the incident. United flight attendants care about the safety and wellbeing of all of our customers, which is why they acted quickly to find a different seat for the disruptive customer. When it became clear that this passenger's behavior was likely to be problematic on this flight, she was provided alternative travel arrangements first thing the next morning. So, she spent the night wherever you were coming from. Looking back on that tape, why do you think that woman was so angry? 
- I don't think I'll ever know why she behaved that way, and why she thought that was acceptable behavior. 
- Well, your brave desire to share that experience resulted in a video that attracted 600,000 views within a few weeks. If you could talk to that woman, and there's a pretty good chance she might be watching this broadcast, what would you tell her? 
- Um, she needs to be healed. She needs to look inside and determine why she behaved that way. What is hurting inside herself that makes her think it's okay to hurt other people? Hurt people hurt people. 
- [Dr. Oz] Yes, hurt people hurt people. 
- Hurt people. And she needs to understand why she did what she did. I am on the path of forgiving her, because as a woman of god that is my job, to forgive, and move forward. This is a teachable moment, which is why I agreed to come on, because this is a teachable moment. I would like to take a quick moment just to apologize to the United flight attendants, because they did an amazing job, but for my language that I used in the video, to tell them I'm sorry for using that language at them when I was referring to the other woman. 
- I don't think you have to apologize for that. God bless you. Coming up, where's the line between fat shaming and concern? What should you do if you feel like your doctor is fat shaming you?

Tell your doctor about dental problems, as severe jaw bone problems may happen, or new or unusual pain in your hip, groin or thigh, as unusual thigh bone fractures have occurred. Speak to your doctor before stopping Prolia, as spine and other bone fractures have occurred. Prolia can cause serious side effects, like low blood calcium, serious infections, which could need hospitalization. Skin problems and severe bone, joint or muscle pain.

- Unfortunately I was fat shamed a few years ago. I went to the doctor after a car accident and he was supposed to do some work on my back. And while I was there he told me that I, at the time, I was 100 pound, almost 100 pounds heavier than I am now. And he told me I should just go ahead and have bariatric surgery done because I was never gonna be able to lose the weight naturally and I was just gonna be back in a few years asking for his help. 
- I was gaining weight like crazy, and I would go to my doctors for help and all they ever said was to work out harder, eat better. They said that I had fat genes, they said I would always have a weight problem, they disregarded all of my other symptoms and said I was crazy. And this went on for about eight years, and I finally did my own research and discovered I had a brain tumor, and that was causing all of my weight gain. And a year ago I had brain surgery, I had the tumor removed, since then I've lost 40 pounds. 
- We're back with our investigation into fat shaming. Could you be fat shamed by your own doctor? Where's the line between concern about weight and fat shaming? Dr. Jennifer Corton joins us now, we are hearing more and more stories of patients they were fat shamed by their doctor. Why is their an increase? 
- Well first of all, this, it breaks my heart. This absolutely breaks my heart as a family doctor to think of, to hear, and I'll be honest with you, you know, we're doctors, I'm not entirely surprised, and I don't actually think this is new. I think we're hearing about it more now because people are willing to talk about it, we're willing to record it, we're willing to have conversations. And things like social media has really opened up the platform to really share our stories and compare experiences. 
- So give us some advice, give the average person watching some advice as a physician. How do you know if you're doctors just, you know, doing his best, or crossing the line-
- 
- Yeah, into the shaming. 
- Into the shaming area. 
- Yeah you know this is what I always say, I say trust your gut. If it doesn't feel right, if you don't feel right, if you feel shamed or humiliated or criticized or embarrassed, you know what, believe yourself, believe exactly how you feel. And a doctor wanting to do the right thing does not excuse making a patient feel any of those ways. That's never okay. And I say as a doctor, and we're both doctors, but I'll say, if you have a doctor that makes you feel that way or you're not comfortable, I'm giving you permission right now to find a new one. 
- Let's give you some numbers on this. Studies have found, hallelujah, that overweight woman are less likely than average to get preventative care like pelvic exams and breast exams and mammograms. There's no excuse for this. But people treat overweight people differently. What is the right way for a physician to address a patient's weight do you think? 
- Well I think there are a few things, and first of all, as physicians, we've gotta be talking about this. These are discriminatory practices, it's wrong, we have to talk about it and be very cognizant of it. But as physicians, we need to talk with our patients. That's not talk at but talk to. We need to ask our patients questions. What's your journey? How do you feel about your weight? Tell me what you've bee doing, what you've tried, what your story is. Asking questions is key. And something that we've also talked about is this idea of never dismissing a patient's symptoms just because of their weight. We shouldn't dismiss patient's symptoms because of anything, anything. We should always be doing our due diligence. So this idea of saying oh it's your weight, just offhand, never okay in my opinion. And the last thing is, and this is something a little bit different, you know, I think in the doctor's office, I'm a family doctor, and do I take someone's blood pressure out in a public space? Or do I take their pulse or their temperature? No, never. But sometimes in doctors offices people are weighed in public places, either in the hallway or in waiting rooms or things like that. And my thing is all of this should be private. This is our personal, protected information. It's no one else's business. So there are things as doctors that we can do better to make this a more comfortable and appropriate situation. 
- Yeah you gotta feel comfortable insisting that, for example, you're weighed in private, 'cause I don't want you not going to a doctor 'cause you're worried about it. Weight's uncomfortable, I know. That's true for a lot of us. But it's a necessary topic. So make sure you're talking about the doctor, not at but with, folks as you care about it. I wanna bring in Norma, the nurse who we met earlier, who was on the plane and being bullied for... Come on up, Norma. Norma, what's the best way, do you think, a patient should be able to address their doctor, if they're worried about weight issues? 
- Letting the doctor know this is new to me, this is an unusual feeling. I've been feeling like this for two weeks or two months, putting a timeframe to it. And if the doctor's still not listening to you, change doctors. Always get a second opinion. Always get a second opinion.

- It's a big day! I'm excited to announce the launch of my all new Oz Guide. They're new quarterly single topic mini zines, little magazines, cute little things, that will tackle some of your biggest health problems. Our very first issue will be on the news stands and at supermarket checkout counters later this month. It's an Oz approved plan featuring the healthiest fats around, which are MUFAs. 'Cause you know, MUFAs are monounsaturated fatty acids. They're plant based fats so the easiest way to remember them is to look for healthy fats that aren't from animal sources, such as avocados. Come bouncing down. Or, you know what also counts, nuts and seeds. They can really fill you up. And one of my favorites, olives. Black and green. So there was a study done through the American Diabetic Association, that found that a diet rich in MUFAs works to actually reduce belly fat. It's a big deal. But you don't wanna want... We don't really want these foods getting boring. All right, that's the problem. I know, I know, you're thinking that. So I've been hearing reports of nuts and seeds fatigue. Shy away from this problem. And then there's avocado apathy. Nobody wants that. Making headlines. And then of course olive monotony. One of the worst problems to run into. So I have challenged three Bite Club members to come up with new MUFA-licious recipes, in my first ever MUFA awards. This is a very serious competition. We have spared no expense as you can tell. I hope you're impressed by that. The MUFA awards, the inaugural launch here, the dishes were judged by a team of tasters who are harsh people, tend to be sour and dour in nature. So I'll present their reports to you. Prior to the show they tasted all these foods. The winner will take home our coveted golden avocado. So I'm excited to hear what they have made. Jenny came up with a new way to use nuts and seeds. What did you make? 
- So I made a burger. I combined macadamia nuts, almonds, cashews and pecans with a lot of seeds. Pumpkin seeds, hemp seeds, sesame seeds, and quinoa, mushrooms, olives. And there you go. 
- You know it could have been dry but it's not. Very fulfilling. Tastes meaty without the meat. And rich in MUFAs as you described. Nicely done. 
- [Jenny] Thank you. 
- All right, next up. Roberta came up with a next level way to use avocados. What did you do? You have a sweet tooth don't you? 
- I do. Secret agent chocolate pudding. 
- Very clever, diabolical. 
- You know why? 
- [Dr. Oz] Why? 
- [Roberta] 'Cause our avocado is the secret agent. 
- It's a good name. 
- Now this goes great with wine. Sorry, I just had to throw the wine in there. 
- If you'd brought the wine it could have influenced the judges. 
- Right, probably. So decadent, so delicious. You wouldn't even know there's avocados in there. 
- It's very thick, and it does fill your mouth, and it's very chocolatey. Nice combo. And this is a very strong competitor tonight. But yours was too. But, before we judge, thank you very much, Roberta. 
- You're welcome. 
- We have Paula. Paula what do you have here? You have an olive looking item here. 
- So we have tahini filled hummus, and these are actually gluten free crackers that are made from all those seeds that just feel from the sky over there. You love green olives. 
- I do. 
- Delicious. And a lot of people eat... Who eats hummus? Everyone eats hummus, right? 
- I love hummus. 
- So I lightened the hummus up a little bit by adding some cauliflowers so it lowers-
- 
- You did? 
- Yeah, it lowers the calorie count. You can't tell the difference. 
- No. 
- And then also this is a daikon radish. This is a carrot, 46 calories. 10 calories. If you need a vehicle to get the hummus in your mouth, try a daikon. 
- Gimme that daikon. I like this idea. You put a lot of garlic in this, I'm very proud of you. 
- I did. It's delicious isn't it? So flat belly hummus. 
- Speaks to my heart. 
- All of these you will lose weight with if you eat them the right way. But, I have the unfortunate and difficult task of revealing the winner. Are we ready for this? No hard feelings. All right. So I have deliberated with the judges, and the first ever MUFA award, and the person taking home the golden avocado today is, Paula! 
- Oh my god. 
- Oh my goodness. Paula wins! Paula wins! 
- You like me, you really like me. 
- I like all three of you actually. Although you won this and that was fantastic, I gotta say, don't worry, because we're gonna be publishing both of your recipes in the book, the mini book zine. So I'm very proud of you. The OZ Guide to a flat belly, it's available on news stands and at supermarket checkout counters later this month. Check it out, share it with your friends, and remember everybody, today the change is happening, our journey is just beginning. I'll see you next time. It's really good.
