- It was July 2017, when Donald Trump, just months into his presidency visited France on Bastille Day. He attended a military parade at Emmanuel Macron's side. He was impressed. The military might, the soldiers, the tanks, he wanted his own parade. Two years later it looks like he is getting his wish. Here in Washington, the Lincoln Memorial is being prepped for a Trump-branded July 4th spectacular, including: a speech, a possible Air Force One flyover, and you guessed it, tanks. There's not only concern about the potential partisan nature of the President's event but those tanks have also proven a bit tricky for the Commander in Chief. Here he was yesterday. 
- We're gonna have some tanks stationed outside. You gotta be pretty careful with the tanks because the roads have a tendency not to like to carry heavy tanks, so we have to put 'em in certain areas. But we have the brand new Sherman tanks and we have the brand new Abram tanks, and we have some incredible equipment, military equipment on display, brand-new and we're very proud of it. 
- So a couple issues here for the President. One, Sherman tanks have not been in active service since the 1950s. Problem two, the tanks that are coming weigh about 60 tons each and there is very real concern that they could do major damage to the capital city's streets, bridges, and of course our country's famed National Mall. Joining me now, Washington Post Senior Affairs correspondent Juliet Eilperin, and former Senior Advisor to Ash Carter and Professor at Amherst College, Mark Jacobson. 
- Juliet, we're gonna talk with Mark here in a second about the tanks, but first the concerns potentially here about partisanship on what is typically a patriotic holiday celebrated by all Americans, Kellyanne Conway this morning insisted that it would be apolitical. Take a look. 
- This is a public event, it's open to the public. The public is welcome to come and celebrate our great country, the greatest democracy, the Constitution, all the amendments, not just the 1st Amendment that seems to interest you only, the 2nd Amendment, all the other, but really just the birth of this country, the greatest democracy that ever lived. I'm not gonna allow you to politicize it. 
- Fair to say that it is open to the public however there is the VIP section right up front where typically anyone would be able to be in that area of the Mall to watch the fireworks if you got there early enough. But now the RNC has gotten tickets and the DNC tells our Peter Alexander that they haven't received an allotment of tickets for that area at all. It kind of undermines this argument. 
- Sure, the fact that there's limited VIP seating, which we reported on last week, shows you that really that there are some political elements. Now the RNC, we checked with them today, they're arguing that in the same way that if a Democrat was in the White House they would give tickets to their party. That these things happen for White House holiday tours, for things like that, that's accurate although again those are where you have limits on who can be here. This traditionally has been an entirely open event and its now being modified to have limited access in part of the Mall. 
- [Kasie] And we are of course gonna get a speech from the President, I mean it's hard to argue that any speech in this kind of a forum would be an apolitical one. 
- Well one of the things is it really will matter what he says, whether he refers to for example any of the Democrats who are currently running for president in 2020, whether he talks about polling, those are all comments that could trigger this provision where under federal appropriations law you can't use public resources for political purposes and if they deem that part of this is a political speech, the campaign, Trump's presidential re-election campaign might have to reimburse the U.S. Treasury for some of the expenses of this event. 
- So speaking of those expenses, Mark Jacobson, these tanks are logistically difficult to get here. This is also gonna cost the US military not an insignificant amount of money. We're not exactly sure how much, but does the military community kind of agree here with the President that this is a good idea? 
- I suspect the military community and going based on conversations I've had with those on active duty and veterans, there's a a mixed view on this. One, if you look at this entire week, this should just be blip compared to all the mistakes Trump seems to have made on the national security front, but at the same time you a National Park Service that's in debt already, well there's a cost that they can't bear. You have a bunch of troops who thought they we're gonna spend July 4th with their families who are no longer going to spend July 4th with their families and as suggested before this is exactly the opposite of what the founding fathers meant in terms of symbolism. I mean the United States was born of a fear of a standing army, the 4th of July has never been a military celebration; it's a celebration of political independence and the ideals of the enlightenment in this traditionally American way. It's not supposed to look like North Korea or the Soviet Union and that's what Trump's set up here. 
- That's a great point about our founding fathers and the way they envisioned this holiday and what freedom at the time from England actually meant-
- 
- If I could, there's a great Erma Baumbach quote, where the late humorist she talks about 4th of July is about potato salad and hot dogs and isn't it great that we live in a country where we don't have to have a parade with guns, and troops, and tanks, and that that the true patriotism on this day is feeling like you've eaten too much. And that's freedom. 
- John McCain, there's a non-profit organization that's gonna print out shirts that feature the USS John McCain. What's your take on the symbolism of that? Is seems as though the White House certainly wants to make sure that the people right in front of the President are supporting him. 
- As you will recall there was this mission accomplished moment during the visit to Japan, where the USS John McCain was supposedly gonna have its name hidden and its sailors weren't invited to the presidential address. I think that's again is a way of poking back at the President. Again, it's a day where we celebrate our freedoms including freedom of speech, freedom of expression. I think again the White House should just have Trump go golfing. That's what presidents actually do on July 4th. They go golf. This would be a great day to do it, not to get involved, sit in the White House which used to have a great view of the fireworks, and leave this a celebration of the American people by the American people. 
- All right Juliet Eilperin, Mark Jacobson, thank you guys both very much for your perspectives and reporting today. Coming up next, Hispanic Caucus Chair Joaquin Castro joins me to talk about what he witnessed during a tour yesterday of a Texas border facility. Here's what he said just moments after that tour. 
- One of the women said that she was told by an agent to drink water out of the toilet. These are the conditions that have been created by the Trump administration. These are the inhumane conditions that folks are facing.

- At this hour, nationwide demonstrations are underway with protestors demanding the closures of detention facilities holding migrant children and families. Advocacy groups organized more than 150 demonstrations. Some outside of congressional district offices. While others gathered outside of detention facilities. The protests follow reports of poor conditions inside some migrant detention facilities in Texas. And visits to those facilities by Democratic members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus just yesterday. This, as customs and border protection has launched an investigation following a ProPublica report exposing a secret Facebook group of current and former border patrol; in it members reportedly mocked the death of migrants and posted sexist memes. We should note that NBC News has not verified the Facebook group or seen the posts. Joining me now, MSNBC correspondent Gabe Gutierrez. Gabe, you're in El Paso I understand speaking with pediatricians that have treated migrant children released from custody; what are they telling you about how these kids are doing? 
- Hi there Kasie, well we're outside of Annunciation House and we've been coming to this shelter for the past year or so since the family separation crisis of last year and they deal with a lot of migrants. They take in a lot of migrants that have been processed by CBP and by ICE and they end up at this shelter before they're sent away all across the country as they await their asylum proceedings and what we're hearing now is over the last couple of weeks they've gone from taking about 1000 migrants a day, now it's about 100, 150. But we're also speaking with some of the pediatricians that are treating some of these children including Dr. Lisa Ayoub-Rodriquez. YOu're a local pediatrician at a local hospital and you are treating some of these children, very young children, while they're in CBP custody if they're hospitalized and then after, correct? So tell me what are you seeing? 
- That's right, for the last several months we've had the privilege to be able to take care of children who while are in CBP custody if they need to be hospitalized, they go to the hospital and we care for them, or if after they are discharged from CPB custody and they're in Annunciation House, if they need to be admitted to the hospital we take care of them there as well. We see a lot of common childhood illnesses in this population, a lot of influenza, stomach bugs, those kinds of things. The population is really unique in that they get a little bit sicker because they already are a little compromised in that they're dehydrated, their nutrition isn't as expected, so they have the potential to be sicker, faster. 
- When we toured the Clint, Texas border patrol station last week we weren't allowed to talk to these children. Members of Congress have now been there and they are telling stories of their communication with these children. What have you heard some of these parents, some of these children, have you heard anything that troubles you? 
- Yeah, I often talk to the families who have been in CPB custody and ask them a little bit about what their time there has been like. Most recently a met a young mom who had a newborn baby and who was talking about the challenges of keeping her little newborn warm; so they had given her a plastic blanket and the baby was in a onesie, but really she was snuggling with the baby and she was like, I just couldn't keep the baby warm, just despite whatever I did I just couldn't keep my baby warm, she talked about the little hands and the feet being blue which was troubling to me and that's just a simple, basic human need that concerned me. 
- Thank you Dr. Ayoub-Rodriguez and one last question: based on your experience and your opinion should children this young be kept in these types of holding facilities? 
- No children should be in a holding facility. They need access to their basic needs. If their child is sick they need access to medical care by a trained pediatric professional. Really it's not a place for any kid to be. 
- Dr. thank you for speaking with us. So Kasie, this, the ongoing situation down here on the border, earlier we were at that border patrol station in Clint, Texas, of course as you mentioned that controversy following the ProPublica report. This appears to be a debate with no end in sight. Kasie. 
- Absolutely heartbreaking to hear about an infant so cold that their hands and feet turn blue. Gabe Gutierrez, thank you very much as always for your reporting on this. When the delegation of Democratic lawmakers toured those migrant detention centers along the border they were told to surrender their devices before they would be allowed to enter the facilities. But Congressman Joaquin Castro of Texas was able to sneak a phone, in with the consent of the women in custody Castro filmed their small cell which included a toilet but no running water. He posted the images on Twitter saying quote: many said they had not bathed for 15 days. Some had been separated from children. Some had been held for more than 50 days. Several complained that they had not received their medication. Joining me now, Texas Democratic Congressman Joaquin Castro. Congressman Castro is the Chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Congressman thank you for being here today. 
- Yeah, thanks for having me. 
- So I wanna start with the basics here. I think it's hard for a lot of Americans to wrap their heads around the idea that you as members of Congress, regardless of what party you may belong to aren't able to go into facilities that our government is paying for and actually document what you see. What did it take for you to get your phone into this facility so that those images could get out there? 
- I just kept in my pocket when they told us to put it on the table. We asked them repeatedly, we challenged them and asked them what law allows them to force us to keep our phones and cameras away from the facility and the border patrol chief there couldn't give us an answer, in fact there was a lawyer there and she couldn't give us an answer, and so at that point as far as I'm concerned they have no right to try to keep legislators who are entrusted with oversight of their agency from documenting what they see. Particularly, given what's at stake and given what's going on right now. 
- So what in your view could possibly be the explanation? I think it strikes a lot of people that they simply don't want anyone to find out what is actually going on. 
- And I think that that's right. I think that they're scared. I think that the reason things don't change the way they should is because these things are kept secret. For example, there was a point at which we were in one of tents that was empty. They had already moved everybody out and these are dark tents with chain-link fences and when the search happened they had maybe 100, 200 people in there and they had said you can't take pictures because you can't violate the privacy of these children. And so we said okay well this tent is empty. There's nobody in here. Can we take a photo of the tent? And they said no, you can't take a photo of the tent. It doesn't make any sense. They're trying to keep everything secret. 
- So they are of course pushing back on some of the claims that you've heard from these women that you show in your video and from others that you spoke to. Do you have any reason not to believe what these migrant detainees told you? 
- I don't, they spoke sincerely. In fact, there was a point where one of the women who was Cuban, she spoke some English and in front of all of us, many of the legislators and also several CBP officers, she challenged them very directly and said that they were not telling the truth about the standard of care and the treatment, and she said that some of the agents had used derogatory words, language, against the women. Now, I'm not saying that she said that all of the agents did that, but she said that, it sounded to me like a few of them had. So she very directly challenged them in front of all us and that's one of the reasons that these women were scared of retribution. But, if there's a dispute about what the truth is in those facilities then I think there's a very easy way to solve that. They have cameras up in all of those rooms. They can simply put out the video from all those cameras and they can let the press do their jobs and go inside there, and the press can be the tiebreaker about what's going on. 
- So the government has footage of what's gone on in these facilities? They've been videotaping, all of this is on camera and yet we as the American public just can't see it? 
- Yeah look, they knew that I was taking a picture of those folks. They knew that I pulled my camera out. I'm sure somebody was watching me in that room. I saw the overhead camera right there. There were probably five agents that we're watching that. So they have footage of all of that. 
- So to pick up on another point that you were making. You said in this facility there were border patrol agents or personnel that have been accused of behaving frankly in way that's not becoming of people who wear a uniform of the United States. There's also been ProPublica reporting on a secret Facebook group that many border patrol agents and former agents are a member of where they have said some pretty despicable things allegedly and that there is now an investigation going on. What should happen to the people who are found to be making these kinds of comments and be treating people this way? 
- Well the people that made those very direct comments about some of the members of Congress, about some of the people that were entrusted in their care, they are desensitized to the point of being dangerous to the migrants and also to their coworkers and they need to be relieved of duty. They really should not be wearing any uniform that represents the United States of America. And also the agents that were on there that did not turn those people in need to be dealt with and held accountable in some way also. 
- Do you take any issue with how your Democratic leaders in Congress handled the recent funding bill to try and help alleviate this crisis? I mean the money that ultimately is gonna be spent as part of that bill doesn't have some of the restrictions that Democrats wanted, many progressives were very angry about how that all played out. Do you feel as though your leadership acted in bad faith and did Congress give too much to the Trump administration as they claim that they're trying to deal with this? 
- Well I think they mostly ran up against a buzzsaw, Mitch McConnell and President Trump who don't care very much for the people that are in those detention centers. There's no question that we needed stronger safeguards or guardrails around that money so that it can't be transferred out and away from humanitarian aid, and also, we also needed not just to pump a bunch more cash into these facilities, for example, when we passed through some of the walkways we saw stacks of granola bars. I looked in another cell and there was a family that was eating ramen, they were huddled on the floor eating ramen noodles. So it's not just about more cash for them to buy ramen noodles and granola bars. You have to change the medical standards and also the standards of care and treatment, and unfortunately in that Senate bill that finally passed there isn't enough of that; we need to do a better job. 
- All right, Texas congressman Joaquin Castro thank you very much for your time today, sir. I appreciate it. 
- Thank you.

- If there's one thing that President Trump does consistently it's provide compliments usually, to himself. As he was in a recent interview with Fox News' Tucker Carlson. 
- A lot of people gave me a lot of credit for that. 
- The public was on your side for sure. 
- A lot of people said that was a great presidential moment. I won, they were totally against me, I won. I have millions and millions of people on Twitter. A poll just came out today, I'm at 54 or 55 and they do say you can add to whatever poll I have. And yet I won and I'll win again. 
- They do? That interview was taped during Trump's trip to Asia, a trip that made history when he became the first sitting president to step into North Korea. Whether that moment will result in meaningful diplomacy is still unclear but the President already thinks that it did. He told reporters that his presidency was quote, the hottest show in town. The New York Times Peter Baker wrote about the President's quest for superlatives, saying whatever he is doing must be the first, the most, the biggest and it shapes his policy choices even as he frames his own narrative with the branding skills of a career in business and entertainment. And joining me now is New York Times Chief White House correspondent and MSNBC political analyst, Peter Baker. Peter, I just saw your tweet a couple minutes before we came on the air that in the course of one news conference the President used best nine times, incredible 16 times, tremendous 28 times, and great or greatest 50 times. Kudos to whoever actually went through and actually counted up all of those words. But the reality here is sometimes he'll make statements that are simply not true in in the interest of presenting himself in the way that you write about. 
- Yeah look, this is a salesman. This is what his history is, he's an entertainer and I think he understands that repetition and upselling in effect works, and if facts are inconvenient or get in the way you just either ignore them or rewrite them, and in this case he has the best economy ever, he's the strongest president ever, the best negotiation ever, the best deal ever, and this has an impact, it does in fact create a narrative out there that a lot of people appreciate, and understand, and agree with even if others are spitting mad because he's playing fast and loose with the facts. He clearly wants to be in the history books. This is one of the reasons why he goes to the DMZ and he walks across that line into North Korea because he was told no other president had done it before. It's a first. He likes to be somebody who's done the first. He likes to be someone who's broken a barrier and done something that no one else has done. The question, you just put it correctly, is does this mean something more enduring? And that's the unanswered question. 
- In that interview with Tucker Carlson, Peter, first of all I people thought it was interesting shall we say that Carlson was on the trip acting as a de facto foreign policy advisor while his own National Security Advisor was off in Mongolia. But setting that aside there were some interesting, interesting shall we say answers to some of the question that Carlson posed. I wanna show you his answer on homelessness specifically and then we'll talk about it, let's take a look. 
- In New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles they've got a major problem with-
- 
- It's very sad. 
- [Carlson] With filth. 
- Very sad. 
- Why is that? 
- It's a phenomemon that started two years ago. It's disgraceful. I'm gonna maybe and I'm looking at it very seriously. I had a situation when I first became president where we had certain areas of Washington D.C. where that was starting to happen and I ended it very quickly. I said you can't do that. When we have leaders of the world coming into to see the President of the United States and they're riding down a highway they can't be looking at that, I really believe that it hurts our country. 
- So Peter, not only is he saying in another example of this phenomenon where he solves all the problems and does all of the things, he says he removed homeless people so that other leaders wouldn't see them, but he also says this is a phenomenon that only started two years ago. Where did that come from? 
- Yeah, we've been trying to figure that out today as a matter of fact, we've been scouring Fox and some of the other places he gets his information from to see if he's reacting to something specific and it hard to understand exactly, obviously homelessness did not just start two years ago. There's no question that there's been an uptick in some places and in fact California has been dealing with this. I think it's been a big issue in the last few weeks in Los Angeles in particular. But he sees not as a humanitarian issue, the way he frames it in that interview as well, it's a public relations issue. It's an issue you don't world leaders to see and therefore you wanna to get these people out of the way, not to make sure that they're getting care or get them into homes but to make sure that they're not visible for visiting leaders; that's a pretty striking framework on his part. But I don't know what he's talking about. He says two years ago there was an issue and he snaps his fingers and suddenly it's gone. I live in Washington, lived here my whole life. It's hard to know what he's talking about because obviously homelessness has been an issue here for a long time, hasn't changed specifically in the last two years in a meaningful way. 
- If anything it's gotten to be one of more visible problems. Peter Baker, thank you very much. Also I would be remiss if I didn't thank you for that Western liberalism question during the news conference; we were all a little taken aback by the President's interpretation of your question but thank you for asking it sir and thank you for being here today. 
- Okay, thanks very much. 
- As the field of Democratic presidential candidates prepare for the next debate, climate change remains a top issue among primary voters. But how does a country balance concerns over the environment with the need for jobs and revenue from industries like coal? NBC's Cal Perry traveled to Montana to find out. Cal this is really the central question as we try to grapple with this as a country, and as we frankly fail to grapple with this as a country, is there are a lot of people who depend on these old industries for their livelihoods and making that transition is incredibly difficult. You talked to one candidate who didn't make the debate stage about all of this, right? 
- Yeah, exactly right and you're nailing the issue. It's a difficult balance especially in a place like Montana. We went out there, we spent time with governor, Governor Bullock, he's trying to do that, walk that fine line in an industry and in a state that still relies on fossil fuels. Take a look. 
- I'm just absolutely amazed at the big open skies. 
- Everything that we're seeing around us is just absolutely beautifully carved. 
- One of the reasons I wanted to come here was just enjoy the park, but then tell people that this place matters. 
- These places are set aside to be, because they're special. These places are changing and they're changing fast. 
- It's gorgeous and you're worried about the receding glaciers. 
- While temperatures are on the rise across America Montana is warming twice as fast. That according to the government's own climate assessment. The state is home to tiny coal towns which historically have provided the Western United States with its energy needs, small towns that are now fighting for survival, fighting in a state that also has the nation's most treasured natural wonders. Anytime you're talking about climate and politics in America and Glacier National Park has to be apart of that conversation. According to the National Park Services there were estimated 150 glaciers here in 1850. Today, there's only 25. Fewer days below freezing and more days above 90 degrees is changing the state. Less snowfall and earlier melt each year means more fires, they're bigger and burning longer. Professor Diana Six studies the impact of forest fires. 
- This is naturally a fire landscape. So it should be burning. It's just that we're seeing a lot of fires now. 
- Dan Fagre measures the disappearing glaciers for the U.S. Geological Survey. Because of climate change his field of study is naturally widening. 
- When you have changes like this they tend to cascade through the whole system and so the same things that are melting the glaciers are also causing changes in forest fire frequency and severity. 
- [Bullock] The current administration says hell they don't lose sleep about this. I certainly do. 
- [Cal] Montana governor Steve Bullock is trying to find a way to balance the realities of climate change in a state with an energy industry that depends on coal. All the while doing it while running for president inside the Democratic Party. 
- As we make transitions we can't be leaving communities behind. There are folks, they've worked their whole life powering this country, and at times Democrats and others try to make them into the villains. 
- For small towns like Colstrip, Montana any discussion of climate change is really gonna be a discussion about revenue and jobs. The plant behind me is within city limits. Between that and the coal mine officials here say it accounts for 90% of the town's revenue. Two buildings at Colstrip Power Plant in operation since the mid-70s will shut down just a week after Christmas. 
- They're gonna see a drop in revenue locally. 
- [Cal] Lori Shaw is a former city council member. She's also the founder of Colstrip United, a pro-coal advocacy group. 
- When a town, a state, a community is wholly reliant on only one or two industries that makes us vulnerable and I think we should always be looking for ways to diversify and become more resilient. 
- Even while faced with certain economic collapse many here want people outside Montana to know they understand the difficult balance. 
- We're not just like a bunch of nature hating monsters. We have our lives here and we have families. 
- I believe that we need to have a beautiful environment but what people don't get is coal got us where we are. 
- Climate change is real. We might not be leaving anything for our children or grandchildren if we're not careful. So we have to address it. 
- We gotta address climate change and we gotta do it now and we actually are at the point now as a country where maybe it was lip service 30 years ago, but if were not taking immediate and durable action now the America that we're gonna give and the world that we're gonna give to our kids and grandkids isn't gonna be the America we live in. 
- Kasie, the Trump administration not only doesn't wanna have this conversation, they're actively trying to prevent people from having the conversation including people that work for the U.S. government. For the Democrat's part, the DNC has said they're not gonna have a stand alone debate on climate change. However, as Rachel Maddow would say, watch this space because we understand they're now re-discussing that and there could be a vote in August. So we may have some kind of a climate change forum on the horizon Kasie. 
- It'll be interesting to see if they do decide that this something that deserves, they received a lot of criticism I think for saying, hey we can't spend an entire evening talking about this when of course it's something that is just gonna so dramatically affect all of us.

- One More Thing before we go. Meet Cori Coco Gauff. She's 15 years old. Born in Atlanta she started playing tennis at the age of seven, inspired by who else, Venus and Serena Williams. After noticing that she had a knack for it on the court her family moved to Florida to give her better opportunities to train. By the time she was 11 she had the chance to train with Serena Williams' coach in France and by 14 she had won her first match as a professional. Just a few months later she was signed by New Balance. Despite achieving so much in her 15 short years nothing could've prepared her for what was to come. First, came Friday when Coco became the youngest person to qualify for the main draw at Wimbledon. She said right afterward that she hoped that maybe she could play against one of her idols. So then came yesterday. She took the court at Wimbledon and on the other side of the net, seven time Grand Slam champion Venus Williams. Coco's dream come true taking on one of the few very women who inspired her to pick up a racket in the first place. There they were, the youngest at Wimbledon, Coco, versus the eldest at Wimbledon, Venus Williams, 39 years old, no one and I mean no one could've predicted what this 15 year old would do next. 
- [Announcer] A standing ovation. Coco Gauff conquers Venus Williams. 
- Just unbelievable. Coco becoming the youngest player since 1991 to win in the first round of the women's tournament, a rising star taking down a titan in straight sets. Coco, overcome with emotion as you would expect, her parents beaming with pride from the stands. So what does a teen star tell her idol after besting her in front of the whole world? 
- After the match I told her just thank you for everything she did, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for her. 
- Indeed, a fun fact for you you. In 2004, the year that Coco--
