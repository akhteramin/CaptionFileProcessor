- [Narrator] Right now at 11, tracking the storm. From the FOX 5 Weather App to Facebook. 
- We are tracking another system. 
- [Narrator] We're taking you step by step through this winter storm, approaching in just hours. 
- Our team coverage continues with preparations for the storm. Why some road crews are actually encouraged by Sue's forecast. 
- [Narrator] Plus, a bathroom debate and a fight for student rights goes viral. How Virginia ended up back in the national spotlight. Your news starts now. 
- We're gonna begin tonight with a winter weather watch for much of the DC region. Snow, sleet and freezing rain are all on the menu and this winter mix could be nasty, especially during the morning commute. 
- It's prompted just about every school district here to cancel class tomorrow along with the federal government. All of those closures are listed, of course, at the bottom of your screen. For now though, let's get right to Sue Palka for a breakdown of when the first flakes will start falling. Sue? 
- Hi there, Sarah. I think it's gonna be anytime between about four and six in the morning here around the Beltway and yeah, it's morning snow and a messy, icy mix tomorrow afternoon. Unfortunately, this does not stay all snow which would be the better scenario. It's easier to get rid of. Ice causes so many problems. But it does look like we are going to see that changeover. As we start with snow that we now see showing up, especially south of Interstate 64, that will continue to spread from southwest to northeast over our area and by the time you wake up tomorrow morning, by sunrise, I think you will see snow outside. This is all starting to push up. Now, we do not expect much accumulation for southern Virginia. They'll start with a little bit. It will quickly changeover down there. But quite a sprawling system all the way up to the plains, across St. Louis to Cincinnati and now here into the mid-Atlantic and we will be dealing with it for many hours tomorrow. We did have to take our snow totals down a little bit today based on the model output and the faster changeover to sleet and freezing rain. We're still gonna go with the three to five inches. It could be closer to the three inches though with snow because the changeover now appears as though it'll be sometime in the late morning. Out here, the changeover's a little later. We could get a rate of snow one inch per hour for a few hours in the morning and that's where you'll get your pile up, but unfortunately for all of our area, this may end, especially in the northern and western suburbs. Everybody west of 95 has to watch for the potential for significant icing as the temperature begins to, the temperature a lot begins to rise and changes that snow over to that combination of sleet and freezing rain. Could a quarter inch of ice be possible in some of these areas? We think that is. And that may occur early in the afternoon and continue until about the time of the evening rush hour. So, we wrap it up with a quick look at your planner. 8 am, 30 degrees, it's snowing. By the noon hour, we're at 32. We're mixing across much of the area. Maybe northern Maryland not quite yet, or western Maryland. By four o'clock, it should be raining here at DC, but possibly, still freezing rain in our far Northern and Western suburbs. Much more to come, including our hour by hour feature cast just ahead. Sarah. 
- [Sarah] Well, crews have already hit the roads, laying sand, salt and brine. Now, they are literally standing by waiting for the wallop so they can get to work on thousands of miles of roadway. Our team coverage of this approaching winter storm continues. FOX 5's Lauren DeMarco joins us from Fairfax now with the very latest out there. Lauren. 
- Sarah, it's incredible to watch these guys do their work, filling up truck after truck with salt and sand. They are heading out to the interstates from this saltdom in Fairfax, and they are asking for help from the public tomorrow, when all of this wet stuff starts coming down. 
- If everybody stays home, hang out, watch the Channel Five, it would be great for us. 
- Stay home, stay home, stay home. 
- As it's gonna be pretty nasty throughout the day tomorrow and into tomorrow night's rush so we're really asking the folks to stay off the roads if at all possible. 
- [Sarah] A unified message from transportation and highway officials in Virginia, Maryland and the district. 
- For folks who do venture out, I don't know why they would do that, we want them to obviously fall behind our snow plows. 
- [Sarah] Thousands of plows and salt trucks are being deployed across the region, loading up and getting in place over night. Preparations actually began over the last few days, with crews pre-treating highways, local roads and known trouble spots with liquid brine, and officials are encouraged by the forecast. 
- It's gonna be coming in as snow from what we're hearing, which is beautiful in terms of interacting with the brine, and we're gonna have 3,000 trucks out, starting overnight to be able to push the snow out of the way, as you see, they're starting to roll through here. 
- [Sarah] Anyone who has to be out, is urged to prepare with an emergency supply kit, charged cell phone and full tank of gas. Plenty of people heading that advice at Costco's popular gas station on Westox Road in Fairfax. 
- It's crazy, it's always busy here, but today's extremely busy. People think that the sky is gonna fall. 
- I think people don't wanna get stuck. 
- [Sarah] Over at Home Depot, people stocking up on ice melt, shovels and other usual necessities. 
- What I'm concerned about is how much snow we're gonna get. 
- I have three boys, so they're gonna be working. 
- So, between snow, freezing rain, or at least freezing precipitation, and then possibly some ice, this is expected to impact the next three rush hours. Vedot told me tonight that because this is starting with snow and it's expecting to accumulate, they will be in the sub-divisions as well, and they and all of the area officials are asking that, in your neighborhood, try to park in a driveway or all on one side of the road, that way the plows have an easier time getting by. Back to you in the studio. 
- Several area schools are already out of snow days, in fact, tomorrow's storm will send more schools over their days budgeted for weather cancellations. Montgomery Country used its two make up days already. Howard County used its four make up days, if they have to miss any more, the school district will have to appeal to the State Board of Education and ask for forgiveness, or make adjustments to the school calendar. Fairfax, Prince William, Loudoun and Anne Arundel County Schools all have days to spare. 
- [Sarah] The storm is forcing Metro to adjust bus and rail service. Trains will run every 12 minutes in the morning to allow workers to de-ice the tracks. The schedule could change as the weather unfolds during the day. Metro Bus will operate under severe snow service plans. So, that means buses will provide limited service on major roadways only, and Metro access will only provide return trips home for customers between four a.m. and seven p.m. All other trips will be canceled. And remember, you can track the weather 24/7 on the FOX 5 Weather app. You can also get the latest on FOX 5 Morning, beginning at 4 a.m. 
- Another life lost on what is being called the highway of death. Juan Castillo was killed last night on Indian Head Highway route 210 in Acookeek, Maryland. Now, the circumstances around the crash that killed Kim, are similar to a crash that killed three children on that same road back in December. FOX 5's Lindsay Watts spoke with Castillo's heartbroken family. Lindsay. 
- Shunning that crash last night and the one in December, drivers were stopped at a red light here on Indian Head Highway when another vehicle came barreling up from behind and crashed into their car. We have told you about all of the efforts to make Indian Head Highway safer, but police say it also falls on drivers to pay attention when they're behind the wheel. I feel he's my daddy. I love him so much and I'm gonna miss him. 
- [Lindsay] One minute as Castillo was a father and grandfather. He was driving with a family member Monday night about six miles from his home in Waldorph. 
- My brother-in-law is driving the car. 
- [Sarah] This is what happened to that vehicle, a Ford Escape. According to police, it was stopped at a red light on Indian Head Highway on Barry Road in Accokeek. Investigators say a female driver didn't stop, plowing in to the Escape. Menedez Castillo died at the hospital. Although his family had only recently moved here from Virginia, they were all well aware of 210's notoriety. Menedez Castillo saw news coverage of the horrifying crash that claimed the life of three children. 
- When I saw that accident pass on December, he say, oh my God, everybody has to be careful, that street is danger. 
- [Lindsay] Prince George's County Police have ramped up enforcement on the highway, issuing 3,700 citations in just the last months and a half. There was a DUY checkpoint earlier this month. The county is working to get state funding to improve the road, and a bill advancing in Indianapolis would add up to seven roving speed cameras. Right now, there is only one permanent speed camera on 210. 
- I think they're doing everything I can think of. 
- [Lindsay] The road is such a hazard, there's a community group devoted to making it safer. Ron Weiss is part of that. 
- When we think of 210 as our main street, and it's just not a good feeling when you go out on your main street and worry about being killed. 
- [Lindsay] He says these recent fatal crashes have been preventable, and it's up to drivers to take back control. Back here live now, the crash last night is still under investigation. Police are trying to find out why that female driver didn't stop. Back to you. 
- [Sarah] New at 11 now, Virginia House Democrats today said they are treating the sexual assault allegations against Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax seriously. In a statement they said, we respect all survivors and believe they should be fully heard. In response, the attorney for accuser, Meredith Watson said, apparently, the Virginia House Democratic Caucus believes that courageous victims of rape need to be heard, just not by them. Miss Watson is counting on the General Assembly to do the right thing and hold hearings now. 
- [Sarah] The gunman who shot up a car outside a popular ice arena in the district is still on the run tonight. The shooting happened this afternoon near the Fort Dupont Ice Arena in the Southeast. The gunman shot two men and a child, one man is critical, the other two are expected to be okay. Tonight, police are looking for a silver Hyundai that might be connected to the shooting. 
- Good news for Southeast DC families who rely on the Fort Dupont Ice Arena, the city's only full-size, public, indoor ice rink, will get a much needed facelift thanks to a deal reached between Mayor Bowser and the friends of Fort Dupont ice arena, the non-profit that runs that rink. If the group raises three million of the $30 million expansion budget by next February, the city will sign the contract to start the project. The expansion will create a new two-rink arena. 
- [Announcer] Well, from the ice to the ball field, the Washington Nationals had their first squad spring training workout today. The Nets play their first practice game in four days in West Palm Beach, Florida. Looks like the weather's a lot nicer there. By the way, Net superstar Bryce Harper is not on the field, he's a free agent right now and still has not signed with the team. 
- Some Montgomery County High School students have been encouraging other students to use a racial slur and, of course, it's stirring some controversy.

- Students at a Montgomery County High School have been encouraging other students to use a racial slur. Some students have actually been sharing a card that gives other students a pass to use the N word. Tonight, administrators and parents met to talk about solutions. FOX's Evan Lambert is here now with the latest. Evan. Sian, school officials found the passes on February 8th at Winston Church Hill High School in Patomac, Maryland. Tonight, concerned parents and students wanted to hear what the schools plan was to discourage racist language and acts. This is what the passes looked like. They're based on a meme of a Willy Wonka Golden Ticket. The holder, according to the ticket, gets permission to use the N word. Tonight, school officials said they have come up with a plan to be rolled out in phases to turn the episode into a teachable moment. Students would be educated about racism and equality. A group of about 40 student leaders have already met about how they can talk to other students. Many parents thought using the students own voices to educate each other would be most effective. 
- I mean, we all came here thinking that there was a plan in play, and there is a lot of brain-storming going on, which is good, but at the end of the day, I think that it's gonna take way more than that. Peer pressure is huge in high school, and if we can use that for good, and have them influence their peers and say, just because you hear it in a song, that doesn't mean it's okay. 
- It starts with the kids, it starts with the parents, it starts with the school, the teachers, everybody collectively play a role and making a change. 
- Back when the passes were discovered, principal Brandis Hecor called the incident, quote, a racist, hateful act that does not reflect the values of Churchill students. The students involved have been disciplined in accordance with the code of conduct. Sarah. 
- Jussie Smolletts lawyers insist The Empire actor did not orchestrate assault, despite speculation that he paid two men to attack him on a Chicago street. The two brothers, who were initially questioned and released, reportedly told police Smollett paid them to rehearse and carry out the assault. They also said Smollett was upset there was not enough attention being paid to a threatening letter he had received. The FBI has joined a separate investigation in to that letter, and investigators believe Smollett may have sent that letter to himself. 
- A Virginia school district is now considering a new proposal to allow transgender students to use the restroom of their choice. Dozens of people turned out for a school board hearing in Gloucester County tonight to discuss the plan. It would allow transgender students to use the restroom of choice, as long as they assert their new gender identity for at least six months. The proposal would reverse the county's current policy that's been a subject of a lawsuit since it was adopted back in 2014. That proposal said students could only use the restroom that corresponded with their sex at birth. 
- [Sarah] It almost looks like the real deal, but it's not. Fake money, mainly one hundred dollar bills, is making its way around Northern Virginia. But there are some easy ways to spot the counterfeit bills and avoid becoming a victim or to avoid passing it along. 
- [Narrator] You can see on this counterfeit bill it says for motion picture use only. A lot of the security features aren't there. When we compare to this legitimate $100 bill, you can see the difference in color, there's a different feel on the texture. 
- [Sarah] The Stafford County Sheriff's Office there saying they have no idea right now how many fake bills are in circulation in the area. 
- All right, well we will have some snow, and maybe some sleet, rain, ice, and circulation in our area tomorrow. 
- There's our forecast. 
- Thank you, Sian. 
- Good night, everyone. It's been a long day. 
- You wish, stay. 
- Well, I've gotta show you how close it's getting, and fortunately for us, we get to get home before this starts, but if you have a morning commute tomorrow, and I know a lot of schools have canceled, the government has canceled, I'm glad about it because the snow could be falling very intensely, so visibility is a problem. And, while the roads have been brined and treated, if we do get a burst of some moderate to heavy snow that falls at a rate of an inch per hour, even for three or four hours, that could be a real problem. And, temperatures are going to continue to drop, we're at 38 degrees, so there will be stickage tomorrow morning. It's not the coldest night, so that means this will be, somewhat, slushy, wet snow as it falls, heavy wet snow, and we'll see this primarily in the morning hours, and then the changeover late morning to noon. That timing of the changeover is going to be crucial, but overnight temperatures near 30 to about 32 degrees. Here's our storm tracker radar, and you can see that we do see snow trying to expand, certainly aloft, north of 64 now. Is it hitting the ground down there? Probably not just yet, we've got some dry air to overcome briefly, but you can see that is all making steady progress south west to north east. And we still expect it in here between about six to seven in the morning, crossing the beltway. Big storm, as you know, it has had an impact for Nebraska, for Kansas, for Oklahoma, for St Louis, it's pushing in to Cincinnati now and the leading edge of that has all turned over to snow, and that's what we expect to see in all our area as early as six o'clock. Again, south west to north east. You can see the blue showing all the snow that's around our area, and this will continue for a few hours. Watch this, the pink, and our model brings that in right about 11 o'clock. Now, this did update just a little while ago, and it holds the snow in just a little bit longer so, maybe that changeover is closer to the noon hour. But this is where we start to see the sleet coming in, the little ice pellets that tick on your window. At two o'clock, DC looks like it will be able to rain, we still have a bit of snow in north eastern Maryland. but all of this may be icing and sleet and freezing rain may begin to accumulate. A quarter inch of ice could be a problem for many areas as we work our way through the early part of the afternoon. Eventually, it's all rain. Especially by the time of the evening rush hour, but there will be pockets where there is still lingering, freezing rain, there always is, and that's where we worry about accumulation on trees and limbs that could present some power outages and certainly some tricky travel in those areas. Here's our 10 o'clock future cast. It's mostly rain, and by the time we get to Thursday morning at 7 a.m. it is out of here. If you haven't seen this before, generally we're going for a three to five inch snow fall amount, especially through the Metro area. Could be closer to the three inch amount if the changeover happens sooner. Five inch amount if that changeover happens later. We think the heavier snow, five to eight inches out here, where there will also be a problem with ice in the afternoon, maybe you'll get a quarter inch out there. One to three inches south and east for southern Maryland. Comparing models, that's what we're putting out there. Yesterday, this model was very aggressive with snow, it did come down today, but this is still a pretty significant snow, the American model, and last thing I'll show you here is the European model. It's been sticking with a less impactful snow part of the storm, but still can see the ice in the afternoon and this is two and a half to six inches around the area. So, we feel pretty good that those numbers are going to be what we end up getting. But we know it's going to be a messy day regardless, and Thursday we start to melt it off, 49 degrees. Friday we continue the melting. We do have rain on Saturday, with a temperature of 44. We could see the rain linger in to the first part of Sunday, but I think most of the day Sunday is going to be milder and eventually pretty dry at 64 degrees. Monday it's sunny. Tuesday we have another chance of a rain-snow mix that we have to keep an eye on. With a temperature of 47 on Tuesday. We'll be watching that one closely and you can continue to monitor that, as well as other developments as we work our way, hour by hour, through a tricky Wednesday around here that could really be problematic on the roads by downloading the FOX 5 Weather App. Sian, back to you. 
- Space, that's the next step, and we have to be prepared. 
- [Sian] President Trump's goal to add a sixth branch to the military is a step closer to becoming reality. Today, we signed a directive to establish the space force. If approved by congress, the branch would be allowed, excuse me would allow the department of defense to handle all space operations. 
- [Sarah] Former president Barack Obama turning up at an event at Oakland, California. He was joined by basketball star, Steph Curry, singer John Legend and others to empower young men of color. It's a first of its kind summit, called MBK Rising. If you remember, the former president started My Brother's Keeper several years back. He says so much can be accomplished through mentorship. 
- I did not grow up and become the person I am until I was less focused on me, and I was more focused on, how could I be useful? Who could I help? 
- [Sarah] Mr Obama says being a positive influence on someone can be beneficial to you because it also gives you the confidence when they succeed. so it's kind of a pay it forward thing going on there. 
- I like it.
