- [Announcer] And now, BBC World News. 
- This is BBC World News America. Reporting from Washington, I'm Laura Trevelyan. Count down to the State of the Union Address. President Trump will call for unity in front of a deeply divided Congress. 
- [Nick] Mr. Neeson, are you sorry for what you said? 
- [Laura] Actor Liam Neeson says he's no racist after his desire for revenge causes an uproar. 
- Racist. 
- Photograph was the very first picture I ever took in war. 
- Plus Sir Don McCullin's camera captured the human cost of battle. We'll hear how he turned his lens on the home front too. Welcome to our viewers on public television here in the US and around the globe. Washington is poised for tonight's State of the Union Address by President Trump. Aides say he'll call for bipartisan cooperation and unity. Mr. Trump will deliver his primetime address to a divided Congress, one that's still smarting after a 35-day partial government shutdown over the president's call for a border wall with Mexico. For more on what we can expect tonight, the BBC's Katty Kay joined me earlier. White House aides say that this address is going to be all about committee, but given just how divided the two sides are, can anything really be achieved, do you think? 
- Look, I think what the president wants to do tonight is to reach out to voters in the middle with some sense of unity and bipartisanship. We'll hear that tone. It's being written into his speech at the moment, and then also appeal to his base with a tougher line on immigration and that border wall. President Trump knows that he's not going to get a television audience this big again until the 2020 reelection campaign is well under way, so he's got that political timetable in mind. Juggling those two things is going to be tricky in terms of tone, and we all know, Laura, that what is said in a speech tonight on Capitol Hill can very quickly be overturned with just one Tweet tomorrow morning. 
- It can indeed. Katty, is this really laying out the battle lines for the 2020 election? 
- Yeah, I think it is. There are areas where the president, and the Republicans, and the Democrats do agree. They could do a big deal on infrastructure, and I suspect we'll hear the president reach out to Democrats on an issue like that. The trouble is, there is so little trust on the Democratic side of this president that, are they willing to give him some kind of a deal that he can then take home and say, you see, look, I've managed to achieve something? The 2020 reelection campaign, in a sense, is starting right now. We've already had those Democratic candidates who have launched their bids. They're going to be sitting right in front of the president. Tonight is his big audience, also, to talk about what he's achieved, and what he can still achieve, and of course, the spectacle of all of this crowned by Nancy Pelosi, Laura, sitting right behind him, the Democrat who has just given him a very tough time, a tough run for his money, over that government shutdown. You're right, the 2020 reelection campaign is all over this State of the Union Address. 
- Katty, what will you be watching for when you see Nancy Pelosi there, the symbol of divided government, watching over the president? 
- Yeah, I mean, it's almost a kind of visual reminder in every shot because, in these States of the Unions, you have the president, and then you have the two people, Mike Pence and Nancy Pelosi, sitting behind him, and they're in almost every shot. It's almost a visual reminder for people of this new tougher political landscape that President Trump now faces. I'd be surprised if she gives him much more than a cursory round of applause at the beginning. The rest of the time, expect her to sit pretty stone-faced while Vice President Mike Pence sits there cheering. That's the kind of prospect that always comes up in States of the Unions. Remember, it's not just Nancy Pelosi sitting behind him. It's all those newly-elected members of the Democratic House of Representatives sitting in front of him. This is a very different State of the Union audience in that chamber than it was for him a year ago. 
- Katty Kay, thank you. Well, the State of the Union Address is a marquee event, a speech which is rewritten multiple times. The White House says the president has been going through tonight's pages with his Sharpie, reworking the material. It's all about striking the right tone while leaving an impression for the ages. Here are some examples from the past. 
- Don't let anyone tell you that America's best days are behind her, that the American spirit has been vanquished. 
- The era of big government is over. 
- Terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil arming to threaten the peace of the world. 
- Well, for more on the significance of these major addresses and the work that goes into them, I spoke earlier with Stephen Krupin, a former speechwriter for President Obama. State of the Union Address is a highly choreographed one. Just how high are the expectations of this speech tonight? 
- The White House would like to set out an expectation that this is going to be, as you and Katty mentioned, a speech about unity, which I think is just about as credible as much else coming out of the Trump White House. The State of the Union Address happens in the House chamber. It doesn't happen in a vacuum, and we can't listen to what he says tonight without regard for what he said yesterday and what he'll say tomorrow. If the president continues to stigmatize immigrants, continues to spurn allies, how is that unity? If the White House has to go to such extremes to make that case that this is a speech about unity, if he does that one day a year using sentences that we know don't sound the way that President Trump, as we all know, sounds, it kind of gives lie to the whole charade. 
- But as a former speechwriter, just how much work would go into a speech like this? 
- An enormous amount of work. It starts months before the speech itself. It is a speech where not only the White House is focused on it, the communications, the policy, the research parts of the White House, but also all the cabinet agencies. Everyone wants their line in that precious real estate because, when the president of the United States says it to the country and the world, it elevates their issue. 
- [Laura] Also, typically, these speeches have a big, historical sweep, don't they? Because the tradition began with George Washington himself. 
- [Stephen] It is, it is historical, and the history of it is all about accountability. It is not the president speaking to the country and the world from the Oval Office. It is the president coming to the people's house at the invitation of the people's house, which underscores that our democracy is about checks and balances, and that the president, whether he likes it or not, needs the Congress to pass his agenda. 
- Although we hear from the president, especially this one, in a variety of ways, on Twitter, we have impromptu press conferences, but as an occasion, do you feel that the State of the Union retains its power? 
- I think it retains its power in a general sense because it is the president speaking to all of the government assembled, as well as the American people beyond and the world, who are listening to what he has to say. In this particular case, I think it does him a disservice. I think the State of the Union Address is perhaps President Trump's most unnatural venue. It is, at its best, an opportunity to call for unity, which President Trump does not do, he speaks to his base, he is divisive, is an opportunity to speak the truth, which we know President Trump doesn't do. It's an opportunity for careful rhetoric, and we know that President Trump is careless at best with his rhetoric. 
- We'll see how he does tonight, but President Ronald Reagan started this tradition of mentioning in his speech people that he had brought as guests. That's really become quite a bit of stagecraft, hasn't it? 
- It's absolutely stagecraft. It's an important way to show that the policy that is spoken about in the State of the Union Address actually affects real people, real Americans, that it's not just abstract political theory. What President Obama tried to do, for example, was talk about people who represented the struggles, or the challenges, or the aspirations that the American people were going through. In 2015, there was a family named the Erlers from Minnesota whose story of perseverance was a nice metaphor for the way the country was coming out of the Great Recession. What was different about the way President Obama used these guests is, it spoke to the country's hopes. President Trump, as we'll see tonight, just like last year, often uses guests in an exploitative way to speak to our basest fears. 
- [Laura] Stephen Krupin, we'll see what the speech has in store for us tonight. Thank you for joining us. 
- Thank you, good to be here. 
- Now, the actor Liam Neeson says he's no racist after admitting he once walked the streets looking for a black man to kill. The Hollywood star describes a primal urge for revenge after a friend was raped by someone she said was black. Neeson insists that race had nothing to do with his actions. The BBC's Nick Bryant has more from New York. 
- [Nick] After his explosive comments about rape, revenge, and race-
- Mr. Neeson, are you sorry for what you said? Liam Neeson arrived at this Manhattan television studio not to make an apology, but to offer an explanation. 
- I'm not racist. 
- [Nick] He admitted to setting out to kill an innocent black man nearly 40 years ago after someone close to him was allegedly raped by a black man. 
- Would you have had the same reaction if your friend had said it was a white man? Would you have wanted to go out and kill him? 
- If she'd have said an Irish, or a Scot, or a Brit, or a Lithuanian, I know I would've had the same effect. I was trying to show honor to, stand up for my dear friend in this terrible medieval fashion. I'm a fairly intelligent guy, and that's why it kinda shocked me when I came down to earth after having these horrible feelings. Luckily, no violence occurred ever, thanks be to God. 
- What makes you think you can kill a man? 
- I read it in a crime novel. Carl's dead. Tell me what happened. 
- [Nick] Promoting his new movie, the theme of which is murderous revenge, the actor had given an interview, telling how he sought retribution after hearing about the rape. There's been outrage at those remarks, but some have commended his honesty, and viewers saw his own personal torment written across his face. 
- Wow, I'm just shocked. I couldn't believe he would say something like that. I thought he was a good guy. 
- It makes you have a little bit of fear, but we have to push through that and find the love. 
- He was on a public platform. 
- [Nick] At this black theater company in London, young actors gave us their reaction. 
- Him using that language in the interview in light of his influence is naive. 
- I agree with you, I don't think we should vilify him, but the statement that he made is problematic. 
- For Liam Neeson, today was supposed to be about promoting his new movie, but instead, he's trying to salvage his reputation. The 66-year-old has been one of Hollywood's more bankable stars. Will he face a backlash at the box office? Nick Bryant, BBC News, New York. 
- In other news now, high level talks between Afghan officials and the Taliban are taking place in Russia. This comes off the back of the US and the Taliban announcing they made progress in peace talks last month. Afghan government officials who are not taking part in the talks criticize the meeting as counterproductive. Former Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho has been sentenced to a year in prison in Spain for tax fraud, but will not serve any time behind bars. He accepted the sentence as part of a deal with prosecutors in a wider investigation into alleged tax evasion by some of Spain's top footballers. Instead, he'll pay a fine of 1.75 million pounds. Pope Francis, who's just returned from a tour of the Middle East, has, for the first time, publicly admitted that clerics have sexually abused nuns. Speaking during a midair news conference, he said the church was aware that priests and bishops had abused nuns, and was working on the issue. Pope Francis added that his predecessor, Pope Benedict, was forced to shut down an entire congregation of nuns who were being abused by priests. Police in Paris say the fire that engulfed a residential building during the night, killing 10 people, was possibly started on purpose. They've arrested a woman who lived there. At least 30 other people have been injured in the blaze. Lucy Williamson reports now from Paris. 
- [Lucy] The fire brigade described it as apocalyptic, an eight-story apartment block hollowed out by flames, its living rooms, bedrooms, hallways fuel for the inferno. Tiny ladders hung from windows, a lifeline, allowing firefighters to get in. It was a scene of chaos, their captain said, the search for residents through the smoke-filled floors accompanied by the sound of screaming, many survivors found clinging to windowsills or roofs. 
- The alarm went off after midnight. It was already black with smoke. I live on the top floor. I had to climb across several balconies to get out. We hid in a corner with several people to escape the flames. 
- By dawn, the fire was under control, but the search for victims continued. When firemen arrived here in the early hours this morning, they found a building hidden behind a courtyard. With no way of accessing it from the street, their normal ladders were useless. They had to use specialist equipment to rescue people from windows and nearby roofs. Police are treating it as arson, and are questioning a resident. 
- A woman who lives in the building has been questioned. She is 40 years old and has a previous history of psychiatric disorders. 
- [Lucy] Firefighters are working to stabilize the building and find the source of the blaze, this sedate corner of Paris now a crime scene, a barren shell burnt bare of family life. Lucy Williamson, BBC News, Paris. 
- So many questions after that devastating fire in Paris. You're watching BBC World New America. Still to come on tonight's program, in Brazil, tales of survival and devastating loss following a major dam collapse. The search for the missing continues. The UK music chain HMV, which collapsed in December, has been saved by a Canadian record company. Sunrise Records says HMV has a bright future, but it will close the flagship store in central London. The new owners say they'll be listening to what their customers want, including a greater selection of vinyl records. Here's Lee Zomazimba. 
- [Narrator] Lunchtime, a quick stampede to the record shops. 
- [Lee] For decades, HMV stores have been a huge part of life for music fans, and for some of music's biggest artists. 
- [Woman] Hello, Davy. [Music] We will remember [Music] 
- [Lee] Now, while 100 stores have been saved, 27 are being shut down, including the one where it all started almost 100 years ago on London's Oxford Street, a perhaps inevitable consequence of a music-loving public who still enjoy shopping in person, but who also embrace consuming music online. 
- People are ordering online, they're streaming, and really, there's still a crowd of people who want to come and browse. 
- We rely on so many other things now, streaming music, we stream TV, we stream films, and they've gotta find a business model so they can survive. 
- We get amazing support. 
- [Lee] Enter Doug Putman, owner of Canadian retailer Sunrise Records, HMV's new owners. 
- We took over 80-some odd stores in Canada almost two and a half years ago, and they're doing strong, doing well, profitable. We see HMV continuing on in the UK for a long time. 
- The challenges are significant. HMV once made its money from huge sales of CDs and games, all of which have been plummeting year on year, but even though many stores, including, perhaps, this one, their flagship, are closing, they are still confident that HMV can exist up and down the country through to its centenary in 2021 and beyond. Lee Zomazimba, BBC News. 
- In Brazil, the search continues for those still missing after the collapse of a major dam. The death toll stands at 134, with nearly 200 others unaccounted for after an avalanche of liquid mining waste swept through the countryside. Our South America correspondent Katy Watson has been to the site of the disaster to speak to a woman who lost six members of her family and to a survivor who had the narrowest of escapes. 
- When the dam broke, there was little hope for those in the path of the deluge that followed. Panic as drivers struggle to save themselves. Elias was driving one of the trucks that day. It sounded like an explosion, he tells me, but he soon realized what had happened. 
- We saw the mud coming, and I told my friend Sebastian, run, the dam has burst. You can see it on video, my truck moving from one side to the other. There was no way out. We asked God to protect us. Death was staring us in the face. 
- They survived. This was the aftermath. His pickup, says Elias, was like a grain of sand tossed about in the chaos. I meet Vanderlei searching for the bodies of his brother and cousin in the sludge. This is their overturned truck. 
- My world's ended. I know I wouldn't find them alive here, but if we are not on top of the search, the authorities will stop looking. 
- But in this sludge, the recovery effort is slow. There's been lots of rain here in the past 24 hours, and these firefighters are returning to areas, hoping that, with the extra water, it might've displaced the mud, and they can recover more bodies. Every so often, they find something. A body bag is flown back to waiting families. The events of this past week are still hard to process for Helena. She was to become a grandmother. When the dam collapsed, that dream ended. Her daughter, son, and pregnant daughter-in-law were killed when a wall of sludge slammed into the hotel they were staying in. Her ex-husband and his wife died with them. 
- [Helena] Camilla, Luis. 
- Helena spells out the initials of Camilla, Luis, his partner Fernanda, and unborn baby Lorenzo. 
- They were thrown I don't know where. They died from cranial trauma and asphyxia. That was the coroner's verdict. I don't even know if it was a slow or a quick death. 
- [Katy] The family's mourning is made all the harder because they haven't found all the bodies yet. In the distance, the search goes on. Katy Watson, BBC News in Brumadinho. 
- So much loss and grief there in Brazil. Now, Sir Don McCullin has trained his camera lens on the horrors of war around the world. His images from Vietnam won him awards and respect in equal measure, and even though he's now in his 80s, the photographer has been to Syria and to Yemen. He's also photographed inequality in his native Britain. Now his classic images are on display in London. The BBC's Tim Muffett went to meet him. 
- [Tim] Life and death as captured by Don McCullin. 
- Everything about me has been very instinctive, this knowing that I should be in this place and that place. 
- This exhibition brings together more than 250 photographs by one of the world's greatest photographers. 
- This photograph is, you could say, the beginning of my whole life's work, really. I started photographing the local boys who I used to hang out with. None of us were going anywhere in life. This photograph was the very first picture I ever took in war. 
- This was the Cypriot Civil War, 1964. 
- With the raincoat and the hat, it looks like a still from some mafioso film. 
- [Tim] Were you scared? 
- No, I was too excited to be scared. I was scared of not getting pictures. 
- [Tim] His reputation growing rapidly, Don McCullin's assignments took him to war zones across the world. 
- That's the camera that got the bullet on this. Right, see it? 
- [Tim] My goodness. 
- [Don] That was in Cambodia. 
- What makes a great photograph, as far as you're concerned? 
- [Don] First of all, it has impact. I do not want you to walk past my pictures without getting some message from it. 
- [Tim] As well as war zones far away, Don McCullin's also focused on conflict and depravation closer to home. These pictures are all black and white. Why is that? 
- [Don] Because I think black and white has a much stronger way of voicing itself to you. It's a silent voice, but I want it to be a shouting silent voice so you don't miss it. 
- Some photographers bemoan the ubiquity of camera phones. It's so easy to take a digital photograph. What do you think? 
- People are now realizing that they want to record their lives. In a way, it's kind of enhancing the love of photography. Went to Vietnam two or three times, but it wasn't until 1968 did I come up against a real opportunity to stay in a battle for nearly two weeks. This picture here, I call it my crucifixion. I put my cameras down. I said to one of the soldiers, Look after these. I had him on my shoulders, and I ran away. I was 31 years old, and I was strong as a lion, you know. I could do it. 
- [Tim] This image captured post-traumatic stress disorder long before the condition was officially acknowledged. 
- He was shell shocked. They had no time. The Marines don't respect people who don't fight, so they were treating him very shabbily, really. What we call the 1,000-yard stare. Everything I've done in this room is not gonna change the world. It's just an attempt to show people that it's wrong, that's all. 
- Don McCullin's images of war. Before we go, we want to wish everyone a healthy and prosperous year of the pig. After all, it's Chinese New Year. The country's state broadcaster put on its annual extravaganza. An estimated 700 million people tune in to this event every single year. The holiday is marked by fireworks, and by dancing, and by the exchange of red packets filled with money. Hundreds of millions of people hit the road to visit loved ones, making it the largest annual migration in the world. Happy year of the pig. I'm Laura Trevelyan.
