- [Narrator] This is ABC World News Tonight with David Muir. 
- Good evening, and it's great to have you with us on this busy Tuesday night. I'm Cecilia Vega in for David and we begin with that bombshell verdict in the war crimes trial of a former Navy SEAL. A military jury finding Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher not guilty of murdering a captured ISIS fighter. Gallagher was convicted of a single crime, taking a photo with the body of a dead captive. Gallagher was deployed to Iraq in 2017 when the incident took place, his own platoon turning him in. But then that stunning turn during the trial. A prosecution witness testifying that he, not Gallagher, actually killed the captive. ABC's Clayton Sandell starts us off. 
- [Clayton] Edward Gallagher's attorneys celebrating tonight on the steps of the courthouse after a military jury found the decorated Navy SEAL not guilty of premeditated murder. 
- Huge victory, huge weight off the Gallaghers. Huge victory for justice. 
- [Clayton] The 19 year combat veteran was accused of war crimes during a 2017 tour in Iraq including murdering this teenage ISIS prisoner seen wounded in this Iraqi TV video. Fellow SEAL Corey Scott, granted immunity, testified that he saw Gallagher, a medic, stab that teen in the neck. But in a shocking twist, Scott testified that he, not Gallagher, killed the teen by plugging his airway to prevent him from being tortured by Iraqi forces, saying I knew he was going to die anyway. Gallagher's defense team argued during the two week trial that the case was built on false accusations from disgruntled sailors. 
- This is not a murder, this is a mutiny. This is a group of young, disgruntled sailors that didn't like being told that they were cowards. And so they decided to conspire to take down the chief. 
- And Clayton Sandell joins us now live. Clayton, we know that Edward Gallagher was convicted of that one charge, posing for a picture with the captive's dead body. So, could he still face prison time? 
- That's right, Cecilia. Prosecutors showed those pictures during the trial. Defense attorneys argue that the sentence for that crime would be less than the time he's already served. So they believe Gallagher will be going home tonight. Cecilia? 
- Clayton Sandell leading us off this evening, thank you. To our other top story tonight, that massive explosion rocking an entire neighborhood in North Carolina. This stunning image from above. A hole where a home used to be. First responders combing through the rubble, one man trapped underneath using his cell phone to call for help. He was rescued along with at least two other people, but the urgent search for other victims goes on. Here's ABC's Steve Osunsami. 
- [Witness] It is just jaw dropping to see this scene. 
- [Steve] Families across this neighborhood in an expensive suburb of Charlotte say it felt like an earthquake. 
- [First Responder] The house exploded and is now on fire, also reporting insulation in the trees. Unknown if anyone's inside. 
- [Steve] From the sky you could see the desperate search for survivors. Firefighters trying to saw through large piles of wood. 
- [Witness] A natural gas sort of issue or if it's something else, but it is still burning. 
- This is what's left of this large home in Valentine. For reasons that aren't clear at this hour, it exploded. 
- [First Responder] We do have contact with one trapped on the phone right now. We're trying to find the location of where they're at in the rubble. 
- [Steve] A man who was inside the home was buried under all of this. He had a phone nearby, was able to call 911, and lead firefighters directly to him. Here he's being airlifted to the hospital. 
- They were on the phone talking to alarm at the time and did provide their location which assisted greatly in locating and removing the patient. 
- Authorities continue to search for at least one other possible victim tonight. The blast also tore into this home next door. Two neighbors were treated by medics at the scene. This is difficult weather for the firefighters to work in with temperatures in the 90s, pushing 100 degrees, more than 80 firefighters were called into help. Cecilia? 
- Urgent search there, okay Steve, thank you. And from France tonight, that nail biter victory for team USA. The women celebrating a close game against England in the World Cup semifinal. They now head to the finals. But today's win happened without their star player, so will she be there for the clincher? ABC's Adrienne Bankert is outside the stadium. 
- [Sports Announcer] That was it, US wins. 
- [Adrienne] Tonight, victory, team USA now charging straight for that World Cup final after a two to one win over England. Tens of thousands of Americans cheering in the stands here in Lyon. The epic matchup getting off to a stunning start with star Megan Rapinoe on the sidelines, no warmup with the team. It sparks worry about a possible injury. At game time Christen Press takes her place, not missing a beat. 
- [Sports Announcer] Right side cross. Done, go! 
- [Adrienne] Even a goal from England powerhouse Ellen White couldn't stop USA momentum for long. 
- [Sports Announcer] Me, drives it from white, goal! England have tied it. 
- [Adrienne] Then there was Alex Morgan with this move on her 30th birthday. 
- [Sports Announcer] Grand, setting it in there, hey there, goal! 
- [Adrienne] At home, fans glued to their screens from Brooklyn to Chicago to Los Angeles. 
- [Sports Announcer] (mumbles) goal! 
- [Adrienne] And just when England thought it tied the game, this call from the ref offsite, no goal. 
- [Sports Announcer] Calling the shot, safe by a minute. 
- [Adrienne] True American grit captured in this moment. USA goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher diving to block this penalty kick. 
- To see them win and go to the World Cup finals, whoo, I am so energized. 
- It was quite a game, and Adrienne Bankert was right there for it all, she joins us from outside the stadium there in Lyon now. Adrienne, all eyes on Megan Rapinoe. Is she expected to play on Sunday? 
- Yes, she is. The team confirms it was a minor strain in her hamstring but she will be on the field on Sunday for the final. And again, even in her absence, you can tell from tonight's performance, team USA has quite the rich roster. Cecilia? 
- They sure do, okay, Adrienne, thank you. Back here at home now a new report is fueling fresh outrage about conditions inside those migrant detention centers. The department of Homeland Security's own inspector general found families held in overcrowded rooms in one Texas center and standing room only for men at another. One facility manager calling the situation there a ticking time bomb. ABC's Will Carr reporting again from the border tonight. 
- [Will] Tonight we have new images from inside jam packed migrant holding centers showing what the government calls dangerous overcrowding. One facility manager says the situation is so dire it's a ticking time bomb. The images are part of a Homeland Security Inspector General report just released today. They found some adults wedged into standing room only cells for up to a week. Others were held for up to a month in these conditions. You can see their hands pressed against the windows. They saw children with no access to showers and limited clothing. In response, DHS says it treats those in custody with the utmost dignity and respect, adding, the current migration flow and the resulting humanitarian crisis are rapidly overwhelming the ability of the federal government to respond. Today, hundreds took to the streets in cities across the country calling for the centers to close. From Austin-
- 
- [Protestor] Don't be silent, ICE is violent. 
- [Crowd] Don't be silent, ICE is violent. 
- [Will] To Miami. 
- [Crowd] Close the camps now. Close the camps now. 
- [Will] And here, next to the border in San Diego. 
- [Protestor] No human being will ever be illegal. 
- [Will] The protests come on the heels of that Congressional delegation visit to other Texas facilities where no cameras are allowed, but Representative Joaquin Castro snuck in a cellphone and captured this video. 
- [Translator] She doesn't have that (mumbles). 
- [Will] Showing women wrapped in blue sleeping bags on the ground. The representatives spoke with some of the women against Border Patrol orders. 
- They were separated from their children, they've been there over 50 days. 
- These women were being told by CBP officers to drink out of the toilet. This is CBP on their best behavior. 
- And Will Carr joins us now live from the US Mexico border, Will, this new report has already caught the attention of Congress. Democrats are now calling on immigration officials to testify? 
- That's right, Cecilia, they're moving fast. They're planning on a hearing next week where they'll have some tough questions about the conditions we're seeing inside of those centers. They're also planning on looking at that secret Facebook group that's been linked to Border Patrol that had some disgusting comments about both migrants and about politicians. Cecilia? 
- Will on this story again for us tonight, thank you. Now, to a major development late today involving the 2020 census. The Department of Justice confirming the survey will be printed without that controversial question about US citizenship. Just yesterday President Trump said he was looking into delaying the census so his administration could include the citizen question, no word on the reason for this sudden reversal. We'll turn now to that growing backlash over President Trump's 4th of July plans. A parade, a concert and a show of military force taking place in the nation's capitol. These tanks are on their way from Fort Stewart, Georgia by rail. The president says it's to honor the military, but there are questions about just how much it will cost and whether his speech from the Lincoln Memorial will turn the holiday into a partisan event. Here's ABC's chief global affairs correspondent, Martha Raddatz. 
- [Martha] At the Lincoln Memorial today, workers hanging bunting and setting up the presidential podium for President Trump's unusual 4th of July address to the nation. 
- It's gonna be about this country and it's a salute to America. 
- [Martha] A salute where the military will play a big part. The president has been fixated on a grand military display since he saw the Bastille Day celebration in France. Thursday's event on the National Mall will include military units and flyovers by Air Force One and the Blue Angels. 
- The best fighter jets in the world and other planes, too. And we're gonna have some tanks stationed outside. 
- [Martha] Those tanks spotted today in Washington to the dismay of the city council, which tweeted, Tanks, but no tanks. They worry all the military hardware, even though the 60 ton tanks will be stationary, will damage the National Mall. 
- He is not respecting the traditions of this city and region and it is much resented. 
- [Martha] The administration won't say how much this will cost, the White House insists the extravaganza is about patriotism, not politics. And it is open to the public, although some VIP tickets have been given to the Republican National Committee to hand out. So far, nothing for Democrats. 
- Okay, Martha Raddatz joins us now from Washington. And Martha, the president tweeting today that the Pentagon and top military leaders are thrilled to be doing this. Is that what you're hearing from your sources? 
- Well, Cecilia, this is a time when there are concerns about the military being politicized, and some I have talked to say there is a whiff of politics in this. The head of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America saying this has the potential to divide and polarize and is the very opposite of what this holiday should exemplify. Cecilia? 
- Martha Raddatz, thank you. Overseas now, Russia's defense ministry is reporting a deadly fire onboard a secret Russian submarine. 14 crew members killed including seven decorated captains. The fire taking place on one of the Navy's nuclear powered deep sea subs in the Pacific. The submarine has been towed back to a Russian port. And back here now, where Nike is facing a major backlash after canceling the release of a new sneaker that features the so called Betsy Ross flag over its perceived link to an era of slavery. And tonight, Nike could be facing some unexpected costs. Here's ABC's Gio Benitez. 
- [Gio] Tonight, Nike yanking this Betsy Ross flag shoe following public criticism and a direct appeal from Colin Kaepernick. The sneakers were supposed to launch Monday, but Kaepernick, one of the brand's most recognizable and controversial faces intervened, reportedly telling execs that the design, featuring the 13 stars and stripes version of the American flag was considered offensive to some, because of its connection to an era of slavery. Conservatives immediately taking on Nike and Kaepernick. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell critical of the decision. 
- If we're in a political environment where the American flag has become controversial to Americans, I think we got a problem. 
- And Arizona governor Doug Ducey tweeting that he's pulling roughly $2 million worth of financial incentives that were meant for Nike's new manufacturing plant there. And Cecilia, in a statement, Nike tells ABC News it made the decision to halt distribution of its 4th of July shoes based on concerns that it could unintentionally offend or detract from the nation's patriotic holiday. Cecilia? 
- Gio Benitez, thank you. Now, to new developments in the mystery surrounding the death of Angels' pitcher Tyler Skaggs. The 27 year old found dead in his hotel room in Texas. Authorities now ruling out suicide and foul play. So many paying tribute today, some leaving flowers outside the stadium there in Anaheim. The Angels and the Rangers taking the field tonight. ABC's Marcus Moore is there. 
- [Marcus] Tonight the Texas Rangers say they will hold a moment of silence before tonight's game against the Los Angeles Angels in honor of pitcher Tyler Skaggs. 
- These guys will be there fighting for each other with Tyler weighing heavy on their hearts tonight. 
- [Sports Announcer] Tyler Skaggs taking the mound for the Angels. 
- The seemingly healthy 27 year old who wore number 45 seen here pitching against the Oakland As over the weekend. Skaggs, who was supposed to play in Thursday's 4th of July game was found dead inside the team hotel. His death still a mystery, police telling ABC News an autopsy has been completed and so far there is no evidence to suggest foul play or suicide. Just outside the hotel where he died, flowers and a cap in his memory, and a growing memorial outside the Angels' home stadium. Teammates, family and fans stunned. 
- Today's one of the hardest days, and I know it gets easier but it's difficult. 
- Skaggs leaves behind his wife Carli Miles whom he married this past New Year's Eve just seven months ago. And Cecilia, authorities say it could take up to 90 days to get the results back of that autopsy, so until then it's a mystery as to how this young man died in the prime of his career. Cecilia? 
- Okay, Marcus, thank you. There is still much more ahead on World News Tonight this Tuesday, the shark scare off the Florida coast. The family in the water, they have no idea what's lurking just a few feet away. And news tonight about an airline mix up, the child traveling alone overseas, the parents claiming the airline put him on the wrong connecting flight. And the total eclipse turning the skies dark, thousands of Americans flocking to see it.

- Next tonight, a parents' nightmare. Their son traveling alone to Sweden, escorted by United Airlines, but when he changed planes in New Jersey the boy was instead put on a flight to Germany. Here's ABC's David Kerley. 
- [David] This is the picture delayed, when this 14 year old from Raleigh, North Carolina was put on the wrong plane in Newark. Tonight, United Airlines is apologizing to his family. A United employee apparently did not realize the boy's flight to Sweden had been moved to another gate. But still a mystery tonight, how was Anton Berg able to get onto a Eurowings jet headed to Germany? 
- They simply failed to double and cross reference his documents with who they perceived he was. The wrong kid at the wrong gate with the wrong airline. 
- It was the 14 year old who realized the mistake, because a lot of passengers were speaking German. He texted his parents, his mom started tweeting, begging United to stop the flight. It was the 14 year old who told the flight crew about the mistake before takeoff, and the Eurowings jet returned to the gate. Anton had to wait for another flight to get to Sweden where he was finally met by his grandmother. United said in a statement that it has been in touch with the family to ensure the safety of the 14 year old and apologizes for the event. Cecilia? 
- David Kerley, thank you. When we come back, the scare off the coast, a family in the water, the danger right there, just a few feet away. And NASA takes a big step towards returning to the moon. 
- [DVT Patient] After my DVT blood clot, I wondered, is another one around the corner, or could it be different than I thought? I wanted to help protect myself. My doctor recommended Eliquis. Eliquis is proven to treat and help prevent another DVT or PE blood clot. Almost 98% of patients on Eliquis didn't experience another, and Eliquis has significantly less major bleeding than the standard treatment. Eliquis is FDA approved and has both. 
- [Announcer] Don't stop Eliquis unless your doctor tells you to. Eliquis can cause serious and in rare cases fatal bleeding. Don't take Eliquis if you have an artificial heart valve or abnormal bleeding. If you had a spinal injection while on Eliquis, call your doctor right away if you have tingling, numbness or muscle weakness. While taking Eliquis, you may bruise more easily and it may take longer than usual for bleeding to stop. Seek immediate medical care for sudden signs of bleeding like unusual bruising. Eliquis may increase your bleeding risk if you take certain medicines. Tell your doctor about all planned medical or dental procedures. 
- [DVT Patient] What's around the corner could be surprising. Ask your doctor about Eliquis. 
- Let's be honest. You only talk about your insurance when you complain about it. 
- [Patient] Ah ha, ah ha. 
- Good point. That's why Esurance is making the whole experience surprisingly painless, so you never have to talk about it unless you're the spokesperson. Esurance, it's surprisingly painless. 
- [Announcer] Always there in crunch time.

- To The Index, now. Starting with the shark attack off New Smyrna Beach, Florida. Police say an 18 year old surfer was bitten on the leg. The injury was not serious. And in that same area, just a week earlier, a shark lurking near this family. The father flying a drone spotted it. He immediately yelled for his wife and three children to get back to the beach. You will hear from the father on tonight's Nightline and tomorrow on GMA. Next, the deadly fireworks accident in Toledo. Police say a man was killed by lighting large fireworks in his front yard with neighborhood children there watching. He accidentally set off a mortar facing in the wrong direction and was struck in the chest. And from the earth to the moon. NASA clearing a major hurdle with the successful launch of it's Orion capsule today. The unmanned capsule blasting off from Cape Canaveral on top of a peacekeeper missile, safely splashing down in the Atlantic. Orion is designed to take astronauts back to the moon by 2024. When we come back, the rare event in the sky visible only from two countries and an uninhabited island.

- metastatic breast cancer as the first hormonal based therapy. Ibrance plus letrozole was significantly more effective at delaying disease progression versus letrozole. Patients taking Ibrance can develop low white blood cell counts which may cause serious infections that can lead to death. Before taking Ibrance, tell your doctor if you have fever, chills or other signs of infection, liver or kidney problems, are pregnant, breastfeeding, or plan to become pregnant. Common side effects include low red blood cell and low platelet counts, infections, tiredness, nausea, sore mouth, abnormalities in liver blood tests, diarrhea, hair thinning or loss, vomiting, rash, and loss of appetite. Corey calls it her new normal, because a lot has changed, but a lot hasn't. Ask your doctor about Ibrance, the number one prescribed FDA approved oral combination treatment for HR+ HER2

- Finally, tonight a stunning show in the sky that only a small part of the world could see, including our Rob Marciano. 
- This is the moment day became night in South America. There it is, we have totality. The moon passing perfectly between the Earth and the sun, a bullseye blocking out all but the glowing edge of the sun's corona, the hills and valley around us going dark. It's gotten so dark you can see stars, and it's cold. Temperatures have dropped a good 10 degrees in the last 20 minutes. The moon's shadow sweeping along a nearly 7000 mile path across the Pacific, hitting the coast of Chile at 4:38 PM. Nightfall for two and a half minutes. You hear the birds? The birds are confused. It's the first one since the coast to coast US eclipse of 2017, and many Americans traveled here to see another. 
- Totality's very spiritual for a lot of people, and once you see one, you wanna see the next one. 
- [Rob] Why the allure? 
- It's a multisensory experience unlike anything else nature has to offer. 
- The next total solar eclipse in the US? April 2024. Cecilia?
