- More, you save more. Up to $1,000 on furniture that's already marked down. With more styles and custom fabrics to choose from. Celebrate your independence with furniture that fits you. Havertys, life looks good. 
- Right now at 11, numerous showers and thunderstorms expected on the 4th of July. I'll have your hour-by-hour forecast coming up. 
- It is going to be a very festive fourth here in D.C. but I will tell you why some say it is costing taxpayers too much money. 
- [Narrator] And, if you need even more of a reason to stay sober behind the wheel this holiday, you have to see what a suspected drunk driver did to a police officer. Your news starts now. 
- [Sarah] We begin tonight with a live look at the National Mall. Tomorrow, people will fill the Mall to celebrate the 4th of July. 
- [Shawn] It is all clear tonight, but we are watching for popup storms that could put a damper on your holiday plans tomorrow. 
- All right, let's get right over to Caitlin now. She is tracking when and where the showers and storms could hit. And you know, we're kinda used to this on the 4th of July, aren't we? 
- I know. Yeah, we do this every year it feels like. I mean, what's a holiday without a weather challenge around here? Especially in the summer. We're gonna do that tomorrow. Probably several rounds of popup showers and storms. Depending on where you are, you might not see much. In other spots, might see a lot. So we're just gonna call it a stormy day tomorrow, because the potential is there for lots of showers and thunderstorms to fire up. Some of which may be severe, some of which may bring some heavy rains. So that's a lot to keep track of as you're trying to get from your pool parties to your barbecues, to your firework festivities. Storm Tracker Radar quiet tonight. We got the day off, that felt great. Showers and thunderstorms last night were relentless. So it was wonderful to not see much around the Metro. We're gonna stay quiet overnight tonight. Just a few clouds, muggy and mild, with that low of 76. Looking ahead to tomorrow. The heatwave rolls on. It began on Tuesday, we're gonna continue to see temperatures into the 90s. And that heat index in the upper 90s. But as early as the lunch hour, showers and thunderstorms are expected to fire up. And we could be in for one of those days where you're just dodging them. So you might wanna have a backup plan if you're gonna be outdoors, you know, run inside as skies start to darken. And there could a few postponements out there tomorrow afternoon. Here's your planning forecast warning. No problem, temperatures start out very mild, around 80 degrees. Near 90 by the lunch hour, and then we'll be watching for those showers and thunderstorms in the fireworks time. I think most of the heavy-hitting action will be over with, you know, the severe weather, by nine o'clock. But there could be some lingering rain. We'll talk more about that and I'll show you future casts coming up in your full seven-day forecast. Sarah and Shawn? 
- All right, now that you know the forecast, let's get ya caught up on everything else you need to know about some of the big events in the District tomorrow. Events in D.C. start just before noon with the National Independence Day Parade on Constitution Avenue Northwest. Gates open at 3:30 p.m. for President Trump's Salute to America. That's at the Lincoln Memorial which starts at 6:30. And the annual Capitol Fourth gets underway on the West Lawn of the U.S. Capitol at eight tomorrow night. The big fireworks display expected to begin after nine p.m. Now, in addition to the massive fireworks display and the concert, new this year, President Trump's Salute to America, which include tanks, a military flyover, and a hefty price tag that some say is outrageous, but others say is money well spent. FOX 5's Josh Rosenthal is live near the Lincoln Memorial tonight with the latest. Hey, Josh. 
- Hey, Shawn, you know we are less than 24 hours away and as you can see, this year's 4th of July's gonna be a little different than years past. It'll be more expensive, too; however a whole lot of people that I talked to out here today said they think it's money well spent. 
- I think we spend a lot of money on a lot of things that we don't really know where it's going, so this is a great for, in my mind, a great use of funds. 
- If Congress doesn't get their act together anyway and wants to waste it on their own pet projects, why not have something to celebrate us? 
- [Josh] But everyone isn't quite so pleased. Here's the deal: The Washington Post reported that the National Park Service is diverting about two and a half million bucks in park entrance fees to cover additional costs associated with the President's event. That money could have been spent on improving parks across the country and even fixing potholes on certain roads like the G.W. Parkway. And remember, there's about a 12 billion dollar backlog of maintenance needs that the Park Service is already struggling to handle. 
- They claim that they want to help protect our national parks and they want to provide the money necessary and to address the backlog of the Park Service. And then they turn around and they used these very valuable dollars from park visitors to pay for this spectacle. 
- Now, I did reach out to the National Park Service with a whole lot of questions about this, but they didn't answer any of 'em. Instead, they sent a statement simply saying, The Department of the Interior is committed to providing the American people a fantastic celebration of our nation's birthday. We are doing so consistent with the Department's mission and historical practices. I do wanna mention, we still don't have a final total price tag for this event tomorrow, however, some of the stuff that you're gonna see, for instance, the extra fireworks, have been donated. Guys, back to you. 
- And the President's Salute to America tomorrow is also expected to attract protestors. Members of CODEPINK plan to demonstrate. The group's organizers said the event is turning into a military style show of force and does not represent the true meaning of Independence Day. They wanted to fly the Baby Trump balloon we've seen flying in London and other parts of Europe as protest, but the National Park Service denied their request. CODEPINK says, Even if the balloon cannot fly, the group will take a stand. 
- We do think it's important to oppose what the President is doing. I'm a D.C. resident, and we know that the last time President Trump wanted to have a military parade, the D.C. residents spoke out so forcefully and our representatives in the City Council said, No way. 
- [Shawn] CODEPINK, again, wanted to fly that Baby Trump balloon about two feet off the ground, but the Park Service grounded that idea. 
- [Sarah] All right, here is a live look at Reagan National Airport, where this year's 4th of July plans on the National Mall will force the airport to close down temporarily. Flights will be suspended from 6:15 to 7:45 p.m., for the military flyovers that are part of the President's event. And again from 9:00 to 9:45 p.m., for the fireworks. Of course, you're encouraged to check with your airline, see whether or not your flight may be affected by this. TSA says, Between today and Sunday, about 12 million people will fly for the holiday. 
- [Shawn] Virginia's Department of Transportation is sending drivers a serious message on this holiday. In a fun way, though. This sign was spotted on I-95 today. It reads, You're not a firework. Don't drive lit. In a nutshell, they're warning you not to get behind the wheel if you're under the influence. 
- Rehearsals are wrapping up for the 39th Annual A Capitol Fourth celebration hosted by John Stamos. People will also get the chance to see performances by Sesame Street, Vanessa Williams, the O'Jays, and many others tomorrow. The show starts at 8:00 p.m. on the West Lawn of the Capitol Building. 
- [Shawn] A little pre-Independence Day celebration this evening at FedExField. SKYFOX gave us a bird's eye view of tonight's Rolling Stones concert. Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, and the rest of the band played in front of a packed house for their No Filter Tour. The legendary band delayed the tour earlier this year while Mick Jagger recovered from heart surgery. All right, well, there was also an early fireworks show just up the road at Six Flags in Largo. It was part of the theme park's July 4th Fest. If you missed tonight's show, don't worry, you'll have a chance to see it several more times this week. In fact, the next three nights at Six Flags, tonight's, or I should say tomorrow night's display, begins at 9:15. There will also be holiday celebrations all over the region tomorrow, and FOX 5 has you covered from the easiest ways to get around to where you can find the local events in your neighborhood. It is all on the FOX 5 app. 
- All right, a Maryland mother is warning other parents after she said her son contracted a flesh-eating bacteria in Ocean City, Maryland. 
- The images of her son's legs and arms are difficult to look at. FOX 5's Lindsay Watts is here now with the story. Lindsay, I understand this isn't the only case on the eastern seaboard. 
- Shawn and Sarah, there have been several of these lately. In the case of a Florida woman, it was deadly. Now, fortunately, the boy in Ocean City is recovering despite these painful looking injuries. This bacteria is rare, but something to certainly be aware of when you're swimming. We wanna warn you, some of the graphics here are hard to watch. These images have been shared thousands of times on social media, along with a mother's message. She says her son was in West Ocean City swimming in the bay near Route 50. She says a day later, she noticed little spots on his body. The next day, they were open wounds, and then doctors informed her, her son contracted Vibrio, a flesh-eating bacteria. Her latest update is good news. Her son is healing. But what happened comes just days after a Florida woman died near Tampa. Lynn Fleming's injuries are devastating. And family says it all started when the 77 year old scraped her leg in the water. 
- Told my mom multiple times, I just wanna be normal again. 
- [Lindsay] Elsewhere in Florida, 12 year old Kylei Parker had to have a chunk of her leg removed. It was after she went in the ocean with a skateboard injury on her foot. 
- [Michelle] Scuff on her toe, and-
- 
- [Kylei] Which was almost healed. 
- I mean, it almost cost her her life. It's just so hard seeing friends and family and, you know, on the beach having fun, 'cause we were there doing the same thing. 
- [Lindsay] The Centers for Disease Control says The bacteria typically enters the body through cuts, burns, or insect bites. It is rare and the CDC says, Most who contract it have other health problems. Early symptoms include wet or swollen skin, pain and fever. Doctors say, It's crucial to get treatment immediately. 
- A very small wound, and the thing that terrifies you as a doctor, is right in front of you, you're seeing this get worse. 
- Necrotizing fasciitis is the medical term for this condition. The CDC says, As many as one in three people with the infection do end up dying from it. Sarah. 
- [Sarah] In case you missed it, there were fireworks on Wall Street ahead of the 4th, literally. The Dow, the NASDAQ, and the S&P 500 all closing at record highs. The trading day ended with sparklers. You see right there, celebrating Macy's 4th of July Fireworks Spectacular. Markets will be closed tomorrow for the holiday. 
- All right, well, if you had a little trouble posting to social media today, you weren't alone. We're gonna tell you what caused the world wide problems. 
- Plus, caught on camera, a man is accused of throwing a lit firecracker at a local police officer sitting in a cruiser. 
- [Shawn] And the blue crab population is on the rise in the Chesapeake Bay. What it means for your plate and also your wallet. 
- [Sarah] And coming up on The Final 5, the issue of adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census seemed like it was settled, but then, the President tweeted and now even members of his administration are confused about what's going on. Catch The Final 5 tonight at 11:30. [Music] You wanna make a fuss [Music] [Music] Better listen up and listen good [Music] [Music] You don't mess with America [Music] [Music] You only get [Music] [Music] You won't stop us [Music]

- In the end, the U.S. prevailing two to one over England. 
- [Weatherman] 91 for your 4th of July. 
- [Reporter] A total solar eclipse seen across South America today. It's the world's first in two years. 
- [Sarah] All right, here's a look at some of the top stories we're following tonight. Another legal setback for President Trump's effort to build his border wall. Today, a Federal Appeals Court ruled the Federal Government cannot tap into Defense Department money to build sections of the wall in Arizona and New Mexico. The Appeals Court ruling upheld a lower court decision. It is unclear, though, if the Trump Administration will appeal. Frightening moments for a Prince George's County police officer. A man is accused of throwing a lit firework at an officer inside a marked cruiser Saturday in Forestville. Investigators determined the incident was preplanned because someone recorded it on their phone. Fortunately, the officer was not hurt. Police have identified a person of interest. The driver of a car died on the scene of a crash with a truck in Montgomery County. Happened around three p.m. in Poolesville at River Road, at Old River Road. The crash caused a utility pole to snap in half. Also took down some power lines. There is no word tonight what caused that crash. 
- Funeral services were held today for the retired NYPD detective who fought to make sure that 9/11 first responders are never forgotten. 53 year old Luis Alvarez died last Saturday after a battle with colorectal cancer. He attributed his illness to months of digging through rubble at Ground Zero following the September 11 terrorist attacks. Today he was remembered as a brave and faithful man. 
- At the end of the day, and all throughout his remarkable life, Lu just wanted to do what's right. And he desperately wanted others, particularly those in positions of great power, to follow suit. 
- [Shawn] In June, Alvarez and TV host John Stewart got very emotional when they testified before Congress, hoping to convince lawmakers to pass a bill that would continue funding the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund. 
- The Maryland Department of Health is reporting its first heat related death of the year in the state. The victim was an elderly woman in Anne Arundel County. The Department, of course, has some tips to stay cool out there. Drink lots of fluids. Wear loose-fitting and light-colored clothing. Also, avoid the direct sunlight, and take it easy with the outdoor activity. Just a reminder for you. 
- [Shawn] All right, got a little good news now for crab lovers. A new report revealed the Chesapeake Bay blue crab population is up 60% from last year. That's the highest since 2012. But the people who run the Bethesda Crab House told us, The growing crab population won't likely translate to lower prices for you crab lovers. 
- Population increase isn't that much of a population increase when it comes to price becoming less, you know. There are more of 'em, but not more of a lot. More of a little. 
- [Shawn] Experts say, It takes several years of population increases before there is a change in price. 
- Now from the Bay to a story from under the sea. There's a new little mermaid in town. Halle Bailey, half of the sister duo Chloe and Halle, will be starring as Ariel in Disney's live-action remake of The Little Mermaid. The film's director released a statement saying that Halle possesses a rare combination of spirit, heart, youth, innocence, and substance. Production for the live-action Little Mermaid begins in 2020. 
- [Shawn] That's awesome. 
- [Sarah] Yeah, all right, all right. 
- [Shawn] Halle Berry for a minute. 
- No, no, Bailey. 
- Bailey. 
- She's a singer. 
- A little different. 
- All right. What a beautiful Wednesday. Time-lapse video from the Friendship Heights neighborhood in northwest D.C. this evening. 
- [Shawn] Yeah, our photojournalist, Van Applegate, shot this, but there's a chance we will not have this picturesque scene tomorrow, right, Caitlin? 
- [Caitlin] Yeah, I'm hoping we could least clear things out by fireworks time. It's gonna be a, kind of a busy afternoon with showers and thunderstorms, so you're dodging around that. Peak time probably about 10 to, or 12 to six. 
- So a little bit earlier means let's try to get this wrapped up. 
- All right, yes. 
- [Caitlin] At least in my mind. (laughs) There's some red, white, and blue for ya. 
- [Sarah] All right, look at that. The Capitol Wheel all lit up tonight. 
- [Shawn] Beautiful! 
- That wheel puts on a show night after night and we love to display it for ya. Beautiful evening out there. It's warm, but it's clear. Storms stayed away from the Metro today. In fact, we barely even got anything anywhere close by. It was nice to have a night off from that despite the fact that it was another hot and humid day. So, it's all red, white, and blue as you go into tomorrow. Can't let the weather stop you. Just gotta be inside. Maybe if, you know, you're out by the pool, out doing some barbecuing and those skies start to darken and the rain comes down. So, today, like we said, was gorgeous. Fourth of July eve, so hopefully everyone is in full festivity mode. Beautiful sunset captured by our friend Will here on Twitter. This is in Olney, you see the last of that sun slipping below the horizon. A lot of beautiful yellow and orange color. That looks like a hot summer sunset to me. And, in fact, it was a hot summer day. 93 was the magic number for Reagan, Dulles, and BWI. It was hot out there. It was above normal. It was also humid. And those heat index values were getting close to, and in some places surpassing, the century mark earlier this afternoon. 83 degrees in the District right now. Winds are still out of the northwest. That's what saved us today. That wind from the north prevented any storms from really initiating, and so we were quiet and we'll be quiet again into the overnight. 83 outside right now here in the District, still warm. 84 in Annapolis. We've fallen back into the upper 70s north and west. 77 in Frederick, 78 in Dulles. So, national radar shows that there were some showers and storms over the past three hours across the mountains. Just really didn't get anything local. Tomorrow's a different story. We actually have a bit of a system coming through. So that will really tap into the heat and humidity and initiate some storms. 9:00 nothing, but it will be a quick change to the noon hour, getting started early on these storms where we do expect some showers and thunderstorms to bubble up. Look at this; that's a lotta coverage. While they are widely scattered, it looks like a safe bet everyone's gonna see some rain, at least at some point. And areas towards our west really look favored. Here's 5:00 across the I-81 down to the I-64 Corridor. We are talking about some heavy rain potential there. Notice by 9:00, most of this has faded away. So, while you might have some wet grounds out there as you're setting up your lawn chairs to watch the fireworks, we might be okay if we get this all over with early, hopefully. Into Friday we go, and it's gonna be the same type of thing. Starting out hazy, late day showers and thunderstorms fire. We are still just in that pattern. Nothing's changing. Marginal risk of severe weather, which means a severe threat isn't too high. Nothing widespread, maybe some damaging winds here and there, but I do think we have to keep an eye on the heavy rain threat and the potential for maybe some flooding if we keep getting these storms one after another tomorrow. So 92 degrees for that high temperature, scattered showers and storms on the 4th, sorry. Just the way it is this year, and you know what? It's just the way it's gonna stay through the rest of the holiday weekend. So, we're not shaking this pattern yet. Hot, humid, and stormy. Until next week, but I will tell you, when we get to next week, the weather looks much improved. Warmer or dryer, still nice and warm, but seasonably so with less humidity. It looks good Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. And that's your seven day, have a great 4th. Shawn, over to you. 
- President Trump put his feud with the U.S. Women's Soccer team on hold, sort of. The White House said today, it will send members of the Trump Administration to France for the final game on Sunday. Of course, the U.S. facing off against the Netherlands. Last week, the President ranted on Twitter about midfielder Megan Rapinoe. Months ago, she said she wouldn't go to the White House even if the team won. She also refused to sing along with the National Anthem during the World Cup to show her opposition to the Trump Administration. Just a reminder, Sunday is the World Cup Final. Defending champs, Team USA, will take on the Netherlands. You can watch it live on FOX 5 right here Sunday at 11 a.m. 
- Well, it was all about the burgers at Z-Burger in Tenleytown today. The restaurant holding its 10th Annual Independence Day Burger Eating Championship. 15 contestants had 10 minutes to eat as many burgers as possible. The winner, Molly Skyler, ate 32 and walked away with the $1500 prize. This is the 5th time she's won that event. 
- [Shawn] And we held our very own FOX 5 Z-Burger Eating Contest tonight at 10 p.m. David Brunelli, one of the top ranked competitive eaters in the world, that's him, right there, scarfing 'em down. 
- Wow. 
- [Shawn] He dominated tonight here too. He beat out our FOX 5 staffers who gave it their all. A big shout out tonight to Justin, Lindsay, Brandon, and Coop. They gave it their best. 
- I love how Lindsay was so dainty. 
- She was something. 
- [Sarah] She was chewing and covering her mouth, something you would not see in the burger eating championship. 
- [Shawn] No, everybody else was just chuggin' 'em down. She got about a fourth of a burger in. I think the champ got two and a half. I think Justin got like-
- 
- It's hard. 
- Almost all of it 
- It's tough, like, there's a lot of bread involved with that. I don't know how they do it. 
- It's just a lot of-
- 
- I really don't. 
- It's a lot, I was-
- 
- Look at you. 
- Cheering her on. We called her the silent assassin. 
- You were cheering her on? 
- I was trying to cheer. Yeah, I was like, You've got this, girl. Let's go, let's go, let's go. 
- [Sarah] Okay, was that what you were saying? 
- Yeah. 
- Or was it, Eat more, eat more. Like a drill sergeant, there, Shawn, my gosh. 
- I was trying, you know-
- 
- Poor Lindsay. (laughs) 
- Coach. You gotta, I was rootin' for her. I wanted her to win. Girl power. 
- Take one for the team, guys. Thanks for doin' that. 
- All right. And, comin' up, seems like a no-brainer. People should know to practice safety behind the wheel.

- Okay, so ahead of holiday festivities, here is a reminder not to drink and drive. A police officer in Ohio was driving down a road when another vehicle appeared, but it was going the wrong way. Police say the driver of that vehicle was under the influence. The officer turned on emergency lights, but that did not stop the driver from slamming into the officer's patrol car. Thankfully, no one was injured, but the driver was, of course, arrested and faces several charges. 
- All right, you might wanna be careful with your cell phone as you celebrate this holiday. Tech company Asurion says the 4th of July is the most dangerous time for your phone. It found phone damage incidents jumped by about 60% around Independence Day. Cracked screens increased by 40%. Misplaced phones jumped more than 75%. The worst culprit, water damage. That goes up nearly 250% during the holiday weekend. 
- Keep them away from your pool. All right, if you've been having trouble with some of your social media accounts today, you're not alone. People around the world began reporting issues today with some of the apps on their phones, specifically Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Whatsapp. Users reported bugs, such as images not loading on Instagram, and problems with Twitter Direct messages, including the app showing notifications for unread Direct messages that were not there when users checked their inbox. It was so frustrating all day today. How did we live without it? (laughs) 
- I don't know, I'm sorry. I had to, you know, talk to somebody about it.

- A groom's first look at his bride before their wedding turned out to be a big prank. Take a look. All right, so the groom actually turned to see his veiled bride, was actually his little brother. His brother's a U.S. Army Sergeant. Took leave from his post in Germany to fulfill his duties as the best man. The groom was stunned to see his younger brother standing there in their mother's wedding gown. 
- That's really cute. 
- Yeah, it was. 
- [Caitlin] You know, what a surprise but also hilarious. 
- [Sarah] I love how he couldn't even really fit into the wedding gown either, by the way. 
- Nice of mom to let him put it on. I would have been like, No, dude, you're not wearing my wedding dress. Yeah, you can forget that. 
- All right. 
- Not my son. 
- That's pretty good. 
- Right. 
- Jim Lokay's up next with The Final 5.
