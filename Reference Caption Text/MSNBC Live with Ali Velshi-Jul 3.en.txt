- Thing that matters is how much we loved. May he rest in peace. That wraps things up for us this hour, I'm Kasie Hunt in Washington. Please do follow me on Twitter and catch me every Sunday night on Kasie DC. Ali Velshi picks things up from New York right now, Hi Ali. 
- Kacie, thank you, have yourself a great rest of the afternoon and a happy fourth of July. President Trump has launched a new attack on China and Europe, accusing them of playing a big currency manipulation game. He tweeted this morning that the United States should match the effort or continue being the dummies who sit back and politely watch as other countries continue to play their games, as they have for many years. Such a move, by the way, would directly contradict U.S. policy not to manipulate the dollar's value to gain trade advantages. And the Treasury Department said earlier this year that no country meets it's criteria of being labeled a currency manipulator, although it put China and eight other countries on a watch list. Donald Trump has been pushing this issue for years. As a candidate in 2016 he repeatedly accused China of manipulating its currency and vowed to fight back. 
- We can't let these other countries manipulate their currencies, they're devaluing their currencies, they're making it impossible for our country's, our companies cannot compete. So we're gonna have our jobs and we're gonna make our own product and we're gonna sell that product also, and we're not not gonna let China and all these countries continue to devalue their currency. 
- Now the markets definitely seem to shrug off the President's tweet. In the very short pre-holiday trading day that we had today, markets are already closed, The Dowgate 179 points to close at a record high of 26,966, the S and P 500 closed at a record as well for the third day in a row, the Nasdaq also closing at a new all time record, but let's talk about this. What is currency manipulation? Well it's a policy in which a government or a central bank sells its own currency into the world market and buys a foreign currency, such as U.S. dollars, thereby reducing demand for its own currency. When you reduce demand for something, you drive the value of it down. Now when a currency drives down the value of its currency makes its exports cheaper and it makes importing more expensive and when a country boosts its exports, that helps lower its trade deficit, something President Trump has said he wants to do. But manipulating the U.S. dollar could have a mixed effect. Lowering the value of the U.S. dollar would likely boost exports and while that's good news, manipulating the dollar could also cause foreign investors to move their investments elsewhere because a lower dollar means lower returns on your investments, in addition, it would effect the price of oil, gold and other commodities which are priced in U.S. dollars. So bottom line is, it's a complicated and difficult business to manipulate the value of your currency on global markets. I wanna have a closer look at this with Jared Bernstein, he was a chief economist and economic policy advisor to former Vice President Joe Biden, he's now a senior fellow at the center on budget and policy priorities, Jared good to see you and I guess I wanna start by saying you're a progressive economist, but this is not really a partisan issue, generally speaking. There are schools of thought about lowering currencies and raising them, but it doesn't tend to be a Republican/Democrat issue. 
- No, and in fact, Presidents of all political stripes have long said, we support a strong dollar, and in that sense, Trump is unusual. Let me tell you something else that's unusual. At least half of that Trump tweet was kind of accurate. It is true that many of our trading partners, China not right now by the way, but certainly in the past, have managed or misaligned their currency values precisely in the way you just described, to make their exports to us cheaper, and ours to them more expensive, and the result is a significant trade imbalance, which you've had in this country for many decades. The ironic thing is that Trump's actions have actually made this problem worse. They've strengthened the dollar. 
- First of all, is this an achievable? When Donald Trump says we should play that game, can you play that game with the U.S. dollar, given that the entire world collects U.S. dollars, not just to buy goods, but to buy oil, to buy gold, to buy, most commodities in the world are priced in U.S. dollars. So can the U.S., unlike Zimbabwe or Thailand, or a place like that, can it actually manipulate its currency deliberately? 
- The answer is yes, it could, but you raise a really important fundamental point. The U.S. dollar is the primary reserve currency of the world. That's the currency that, as you just said, other countries often trade in. Also, what's the safest asset if you want to park your money somewhere safe? It's here in the U.S., and so that means folks need dollars to buy our treasury securities. By the way, when I said Trump is partly at the core of this problem, by running these very very large budget deficits, especially at a period of lull unemployment, not only is our country growing faster, and that tends to make our dollar stronger than other currencies, but it's pulling in more capital from across the globe, seeking these safe assets. But, bottom line, yes there are things we could do, and frankly, things we should do. The least we should do is identify those who manipulate their currencies, and amazingly, the Trump administration has essentially refused to do. 
- Let's talk about being the primary reserve currency of the world. One of the reasons the U.S. is that thing is because it's relatively stable. If you put your money in to U.S. dollars to buy treasuries, or to buy property in Miami or whatever it is you do with your money, the value of the currency doesn't tend to fluctuate all that much. If we send out a signal that we're looking to reduce the value of the U.S. dollar, what's the effect on all those people, companies, sovereign well funds that invest in dollars because it's a safe, steady currency? 
- You know, it's really hard to say because we just don't do that. I will say, though, that the dollar fluctuates pretty significantly. In fact, one of the ways you can tell when China and other were pegging their currency, is that they didn't fluctuate relative to the dollar. They kept it at a very stable level, a straight line. But, the U.S. dollar goes up and down, it's up maybe seven to 10% over the last few months, and we don't see dramatic changes in any of the kind of trades you just mentioned. So I actually think that it would be worth our while to at least examine ways in which we can push back against those who misalign their currencies, because it does lead to significant trade imbalances. I just wanna make it clear that most of what Donald Trump does has made the problem worse. 
- Jared, good to see you as always. Thanks for tackling a complicated topic for our viewers. Jared Bernstein, 
- Thank you. 
- is a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. While the President creates this latest issue over currency manipulation, the administration is getting legal pushback for how it's handling the immense backlog of immigration cases in the U.S. court system. A federal judge reversed a directive from Attorney General William Barr that ordered immigration judges to hold asylum seeking migrants without bail. It kept migrants detained while their cases are processed instead releasing them while their cases move through the courts. Critics said this administration's directive would have kept up to 40,000 migrants in custody for six months or more without the government having to justify the detentions. Now as of April, there's a backlog of nearly 900,000 cases pending, cases overseen by 424 judges across the country. The U.S. District Judge ruled that the policy was unconstitutional and maintained that those entering the United States are entitled due process under the Fifth Amendment. The court concluded among those protections is a longstanding prohibition against indefinite civil detention with no opportunity to test its necessity. The Ninth Circuit has expressed, grave doubts that any statute that allows for arbitrary prolonged detention without any process is constitutional. Let's remind ourselves what the problem is that the government is solving here. Before this change was made, the Department of Homeland Security says only 7.89% of asylum seekers from the northern triangle countries, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, were granted asylum in the fiscal year of 2017. So when people tell you that there's this crazy system where people are applying for asylum and getting it, 7.89% of people from those countries get it. Figures from the Justice Department show 89% of asylum seekers do in fact show up for their court dates, so we're talking about 11% whose cases are decided in absentia. Typically, those cases are decided against those people, so it's just important to keep track of what this serious problem, or so called serious problem, is that we're solving. I wanna get into the significance of all this with MSNBC's legal analyst Danny Cevallos. Danny, this is another reminder that the constitution of the United States, in most cases, makes no distinction between citizens and noncitizens in its prescriptions, so, in this case, the Fifth Amendment clause that calls for a speedy trial is for everybody. 
- Yes, but the government actually argued against what you just said, by arguing to the court that these migrants are excludable persons. They don't really fit within the group of people protected by the constitution. And the court said that is not the case in this situation. As a criminal defense attorney, I have to tell you that when your client is held in custody, there's such a difference between a client that is held in custody and not in custody that's out that you can contact, you can call, you can meet with them. Any lawyer always provides better legal services, and that client is better served, when they can fight their case on the outside, and not the inside. What's different here is that these are non criminals. These are non criminals being detained, and I should add, a decision that has had such a ripple effect that you just talked about. Statistically, this is causing an immense backlog in the courts, and that's another thing I can tell, from experience, is a very dangerous thing for those with constitutional rights, which is everyone, which is a backlog in the criminal courts. 
- That would be a problem in any country, but it's actually something in the United States that is in our constitution. 
- Massively so. 
- It's obviously open to interpretation what a speedy trial is, but when you have 400 some odd immigration judges dealing with 900,000 cases, that is going to be, at our current pace, that's decades. 
- I saw it with my own eyes, covering this issue at the border. Slightly different but the Trump administration made a summary decision to start prosecuting more and more of these entry cases, and the backlog that created was almost overwhelming. The courts are very sensitive to backlog, and even the federal courts, which may have more resources, can be crippled. So too can this entire immigration process by a decision that causes a backlog by holding people longer than necessary. Keep in mind, the government argued that, look there are other cases that say you can hold people up to six months. What's with this seven days? That's such a fast timeline. But the court here said, no, that's not the issue. The fundamental issue here is whether or not these people can be held without any bail hearing at all whatsoever. 
- All right, thank you Danny for clearing this up for us. Danny Cevallos is our legal analyst. To really underscore this administration's policy on immigration, I turned to this quote, a ticking time bomb. That's how senior managers at several border patrol facilities at the Rio Grande Valley describe the situation. The Homeland Security Department's Office of Inspector General detailed the dire situation inside these detention facilities, giving the public its first actual look at the situation inside, and despite the outright denials from the administration, the situation is dire. In June, the Office, be reminded this is the Inspector General for the Department of Homeland Security, this isn't reporters, this isn't Democratic members of Congress. The Office visited five border patrol facilities, and two ports of entry, observing, serious overcrowding and prolonged detention. They found the border patrol was holding about 8,000 detainees in custody at the time of their visit, with 3,400 held longer than the 72 hours generally permitted under the Customs and Border Protection standards. 1,500 of those detained were held for more than 10 days. 826 children were held at those facilities for longer than 72 hours. On top of that, the Inspector General found, that the conditions under which these children were being detained were below Customs and Border Patrol standards. At three of these five border patrol facilities that were visited, children had no access to showers despite CBP requirements that reasonable efforts be made to provide showers to children who've been in detention for 48 hours. Children had limited access to a change of clothes, and two facilities had not provided any of them access to hot meals, as is also required. For adults, the CBP requires that reasonable efforts be made to allow detainees to shower within 72 hours. According to the report, most single adults had not had a shower in CBP custody despite several being held for as long as a month. No shower, for a month. Border patrol was giving detainees wet wipes to maintain personal hygiene. Most single adults detainees were wearing the clothes they arrived in days, weeks, and even a month prior. Joining me now is someone who's been inside several detention facilities, and is very familiar with their conditions, MSNBC's Jacob Soboroff. Jacob, you have been reporting this for a long time, as have your colleagues here at MSNBC. Members of Congress have gone in. The government's response has been these are inaccurate reports, it's not the case, but now we've got this Inspector General's report from the Department of Homeland Security, which directly contradicts what the administration has been saying. 
- Not only does this Inspector General report, Ali, directly contradict what Kevin McAleenan has been saying, and what the administration has been saying, the reporting Julia Ainsley and I did on Monday, also directly contradicts, not in the Rio Grande Valley sector, but in the El Paso sector. We're seeing this in a systemic way across different border patrol sectors across the southwest border, and that phrase ticking time bomb is one that's getting everybody's attention. But I want people to realize that this system has been a ticking time bomb for decades. You are housing migrants who are coming here for humanitarian relief, in jail cells, and that is something that Kevin McAleenan, frankly, has said, but it should not come as a surprise that anybody in this administration, whether it's law enforcement or in the political branch of the administration, that things are as bad as they are today. This administration has made things worse than ever before by exacerbating crises on the border by making people wait in Mexico, by telling people that they're going to be mired at ports of entry, by only allowing a limited amount of people through every single day, so you have people that are crossing illegally in order to come in to this country, and they're being detained as if they are criminals when all they want is relief, like the relief you were just talking about, Danny Cevallos' asylum protection, which is an international right. 
- Kevin McAleenan has called for an investigation, but it's not actually about this. It's about a different and related case in which there was a secret Facebook page that was discovered, because somebody in it leaked it to ProPublica, indicating the culture that at least some of these employees at CBP have, because there are about 10,000 people on this page. 
- The culture that you are seeing emerge there, Ali, is one that matches directly the conditions that you are seeing inside these detention facilities, and while we can't ascribe the dehumanization and the language that was used in those Facebook posts, to all the agents in the border patrol. In fact I've met many excellent men and women who work for the border patrol. You have to be alarmed by what you are seeing here. The combination of people being held in conditions like the ones we're looking at on the screen, right now, and the types of conversations you are hearing from the, remember these are law enforcement agents, allegedly, that are talking this way about people they are supposed to be in charge of, and supervising, is incredibly concerning. So, the acting Secretary of Homeland Security, Kevin McAleenan has launched this investigation from the Office of Personal Responsibility, and they'll look into whether or not these agents are meeting the standards of the Department. I think it's pretty clear to see, just by reading some of what was on Facebook and came out through ProPublica, that they certainly were not. 
- Jacob, thanks for your continued great reporting on this. Jacob Soboroff for us in Los Angeles. Joining me now is the Congresswoman who led her fellow lawmakers during yesterday's tour of the largest child detention facility in Homestead Florida, Democratic representative Frederica Wilson of Florida. Congresswoman, thank you for joining us. What'd you see when you were there? 
- Thank you, Ali. Well, I've been on this mission for two years now, trying to locate the girls and do oversight over adolescent girls, so I went to Brownsville, Texas, visited two facilities there, I've been to Homestead, and then I decided to invite my follow colleagues to go with me to Homestead, just to keep up with adolescent girls who should not be in jail, and that's specifically what they're in. And they're just crowded, thousands of young people crowded, and noisy, in this jail. That's what I call it, this is a jail. They are in classes, but I believe they should be in public schools, and the bathrooms, the only toilets they can use are outside. Their dormitory is about the size of a high school gymnasium with just bunk beds two feet apart, where these children have to sleep, and when they have to go to the bathroom at night? They have to get up and go outside in the dark in the night to go to the bathroom, which is portable toilets. 
- Congresswoman, this is a privately run facility, in which we as tax payers are paying them a day rate to accommodate these students. A rate that, in some of these cases, has been surprisingly high, in excess of $700 a night, and they're sleeping in this way. They're living in this way. 
- It is unbelievable. Some of them are sick, influenza is all over the place. They're suffering, crying, they want to see their parents, and the sad part about it, the girls that I finally got to see after demanding and staying over two hours, after everyone had left, to see the girls. I saw this room full of 17 year olds, and these young people are actually waiting for the day that they turn 18. And when they turn 18, they're gonna shackle their wrists, shackle their ankles, and take them to jail. And that is the saddest thing. 
- What does success in this situation look like to you? 
- It's dire, because what they're trying to do, and what they're going to do, is expand this facility, instead of releasing these children out of this facility, giving them a home to wait on their cases, and some of them have phone numbers tattooed to their wrists, some of them have little notes that they could show me of aunties and people who are waiting for them. They're expanding this facility and trying to take 1000 more. They already have in excess of 2000 children. It is unbelievable, unbelievable, and there's no way to know whether these children are getting the appropriate hygiene. These little girls are going from girlhood to womanhood, and I just didn't like what I see. I do not like what I see. I'm gonna go back, and I'm gonna keep watching these girls, because if they can do anything else for me, is begin to release these girls by the hundreds, into the community. 
- Congresswoman, good to talk to you. Thank you for joining us, Congresswoman Frederica Wilson of Florida. All right

- The 2020 Democratic candidates are hitting the road this week, taking no break for the 4th of July holiday. Today they're spread across key primary states of Iowa, Nevada, and New Hampshire. Now we have new polling, all showing former Vice President, Joe Biden in the lead, second place alternating between Senator Kamala Harris and Senator Bernie Sanders. Looking at the Quinnipiac University poll, Harris is closing the gap, up 13 points in the last three weeks, while front runner Biden is down eight points. Harris stands at 20%, Biden at 22. That's a virtual tie when you consider the margin of error. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders follow. Senator Harris and former Vice President Biden are among the Democratic candidates campaigning in Iowa today, where a new U.S.A Today Suffolk University poll shows Biden continues to lead, with 24%. Harris is in second place with 16%. Joining me now, MSNBC's Vaughn Hillyard who's on the trail with Harris in West Des Moines. Vaughn, what's it looking like out there? 
- Yeah, this what the scenes around Iowa in the summer time begin to look like. Right over here, you'll see the Senator from California, Kamala Harris behind us here in the white. We are here in West Des Moines. This is the West Des Moines Democrats picnic, and actually right before you tossed to me, I saw Senator Amy Klobuchar walking behind our camera. They're the two candidates in this part of the main Des Moines area here today. They're gonna both address several hundred of the folks here in West Des Moines here this afternoon. Then she has a town hall, here later today, and that conversation is, what do you take as the candidate from that debate stage, where Kamala Harris really, for the first time, drew those contrasts with Vice President Joe Biden, and what does that message look like out here on the campaign trail? Well, you could say this is the beginning of the second inning, and we'll continue to pay attention to that as we go forward, and what her messaging is here to this Iowa crowd. This is just the first stop over the course of three days. She'll then head to New Orleans, and then she'll head to South Carolina on Sunday and Monday, Ali. 
- Vaughn, earlier when I talked to you and I asked you what Kamala Harris is going to do to fill the space between those moments that she tends to have, including the one on the debate stage the other day, that caused this increase in her polling, you mentioned campaigning. Does she have some sort of a strategy as far as you know of to maintain this momentum, because part of it is that so many more eyes are on her. 
- Exactly and look at this. A lot of this in places like Iowa, it comes down to television markets. For example, right here today we're in the Des Moines television market, tomorrow, she's gonna be over in Council Bluff, the Omaha television market, on Friday, she's gonna be up in Sioux City. So, it's hitting those areas, getting your message out. Essentially bringing in local television channels here, engaging, we expect to talk with her again today, and being engaging in that conversation through it. She raised three and a half million dollars over the course of the three days after the debate. That is, the campaign, looks at that as help. She now has 65 staffers as of today, here on the ground in Iowa, and so while she may make her stop here in places like this, it's the staffers. You can see the staffers with clipboards, essentially getting the names, phone numbers of people here and trying to get them to commit to caucus, commit to volunteer, because Kamala Harris as one human being, can only do so much. She's human, and then it's a matter of putting that operation in which, the Kamala Harris campaign believes they have a real shot to win here. As the polling suggests, she's got a play to make. Barack Obama won this place back in 2008. She believes she can make that pitch here and last point, you just heard the name. A lot of times at these events, Ali, it comes down to local politics. The senate candidate on the Democratic side who will likely take on Republican Joni Ernst, she's here at this event. A lot of it's local, bringing in those folks, the state legislatures, building those connections, and being out there to support them at the same time, which Amy Klobuchar and Senator Kamala Harris are here doing today. 
- Vaughn, good to see you as always. Thanks, friend. Vaughn Hillyard in Des Moines, Iowa for us. Former Vice President Joe Biden also spending the day in Iowa after his campaign announced it raised 21.5 million dollars in the second quarter. Just to compare that to Pete Buttigieg, he brought in 24.8 million dollars, Bernie Sanders, 18 million dollars. NBC News corespondent Mike Memoli is on trail with the former Vice President. Joins me now from Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Mike, it's a good fund raising haul, but by all accounts, last week as these post debate polls have come out, has not been great for Joe Biden. 
- Yeah, you're right, Ali, and this is something that we've seen from the Biden campaign, since really the start of this campaign in April. Anytime they've gone through a little bit of a rough patch, been dealing with some sort of controversy, they often try to pivot the storyline back to a position of strength. Sometimes, that's been by returning the discussion to a debate between Joe Biden and President Trump. That's of course the big electability argument that really is a cornerstone of Biden's support in a lot of these polls. Today, as everyone's getting ready to head off to their holiday weekend, and they are still dealing with the fallout of that shaky debate performance, we saw the Biden campaign take the opportunity to put out that big fundraising number. Yes, 21.5 million dollars. It's not as high as what we saw from Mayor Pete Buttigieg, but the Biden campaign pointing out that they haven't been in the race for the full 90 day period of that second quarter, and so if you average it out, per day, he did, in fact, raise more money than any of the other contenders, at least those from who we heard so far. 90% of that donations have come from small donors, from grassroots supporters in less than $200 increments, and we also know that they've been doing a lot of high dollar fundraising as well. He has done some 27 big dollar fundraisers so far. What's important to know and what Biden campaign also wants to point out is that a dollar for Joe Biden goes a lot longer than it goes for, a dollar for even a Kamala Harris, who we talk about a lot on our air, but maybe the average voter doesn't have as much recognition of. Biden is putting a lot of that money early into investments in the ground game. They say they have 50 paid staff here in Iowa. They just doubled their senior staff in New Hampshire. So, yes he'll spend a lot of that on TV ads down the road, but they're using a lot more of that money in investment and infrastructure than some of the other campaigns who are gonna be saving a lot of that for TV ads, just so that voters get to know them. 
- That's a good point, interesting. Mike, thanks very much. Mike Memoli in Waterloo, Iowa for us. The German government fined Facebook over 2 million dollars for under reporting the amount of illegal content like hate speech on its platform. German authorities say there were more complaints about antisemitic content than Facebook led on in a recent transparency report. The fine itself is small, given the company's size. It draws attention, however, to the embattled social media giant's clashes with other world powers. As the growing threat of hate speech emerges, this is a topic of debate within governments across the world. We reached out to Facebook for comment, but we have not heard back. Joining me now is Rashad Robinson, the President of Color of Change, which is the nation's largest online racial justice organization. He's met with Facebook's Chief Operating Officer, Sheryl Sandberg over a dozen times, to discuss the issues facing the company. Rashad, good to see you. Thank you for being here. 
- Good to be here. 
- There's a context, particularly in Germany, where, as a result of the Holocaust, they are hyper sensitive toward hate speech, and the degree to which it can catch on. It does seem that the Europeans are further ahead than Americans are on dealing with this issue. 
- Absolutely, I mean, they are. The fine, as you said, is small, but the symbol of the fine, the symbol of holding an institution like Facebook accountable, is serious, and unfortunately, we have not had that level of oversight from the FTC here, from congress, from the authorities that are supposed to be stepping in when institutions' communications platforms, others, do not live up to our standards. 
- Why do you think that is? Is it a will thing, is it an understanding? 
- It's a couple of things. First of all, it is certainly a will thing. It's a will thing when it comes to congress. It's become politicized on both sides, and I don't wanna create false equivalencies, because the Republicans have controlled the levers of power and could have stepped in after the 2016 election and done a lot more. The FTC lacks the type of teeth that it needs, and so what we've seen is them sort of win settlements, or get fines, and then not be able to implement, or hold accountable, once Facebook then goes back and violates some of the things that they were called out on in the first place. 
- All right, so you have had conversations with Sheryl Sandberg. In fact, she's had something to say about the census coming up. Facebook wants to play a role in ensuring that the census is completed properly, and one wouldn't have thought that's a problem, except that in our world of misinformation, you can imagine people putting false news out about the census and that, somehow messing up the count. 
- Yes, you cannot fill out your census on Facebook. But to that point, and this was part of a long term work we've been doing at Color of Change. For the last several years, we've been pushing the organization to get really clear about their civil rights work. Back in November, we got them to commit to publicly releasing their civil rights audit, and they did the first phase in December, which was really weak. It didn't actually list the structural things. This last phase, that they released on Sunday, showed some more progress. Since Sheryl Sandberg has taken over the audit, and put it under her office, we have seen a marked change in their commitment to actually trying to solve these problems. For us, though, the metric of success is a different type of experience. But as part of that, we wanted them to really dig in, not just into how they were going to deal with this upcoming election, but how do they treat the census like an election, as well. As a big event, where all sorts of forces are going to try to come in, because there's a lot at stake, and influence it, use racial appeals, use other things to try to suppress turnout, to try to suppress participation, and so part of this is that Facebook makes a lot of money. It's the largest communications platform in the world, and they have a responsibility to make sure that the technology that moves us into the future doesn't drag us into the past. 
- All right, so lets talk about this investigation that's been ordered by the head of the Department of Homeland Security, into the secret Facebook post that had almost 10,000 people on it in which they were saying remarkably sexist, misogynist, racist things about members of congress, about migrants. It's 10,000 people. We do not mean that to taint the good work of those people in Customs and Border Patrol who are not involved in it, but talk to me about how you think about this. This is a secret group, who we only found about it, because somebody in it leaked this information, because they thought it had gone too far. Does Facebook have a role in that? 
- Yeah, Facebook does have a role in it 'cause Facebook, these private groups, they mine the data, and then they mine the data, and then they work to make money off of that data. So they've created these private groups, and then they have community standards about hate, about what you can say and what you can do on their platform. 
- [Ali] And that applies even if your group is private? 
- It should, it does apply even it does, and it needs to apply no matter how powerful the people who are doing it are. The trick here is, it's okay to have traffic rules, but the traffic rules only matter if they apply to all of us, and the fact of the matter is that these private groups can exist on their platform, and then allow for the type of sowing and creation of hate, and then nothing happens. Facebook has a role in this. I also think that the government has a role. The fact that people felt so comfortable, in a space, 
- [Ali] Law enforcement Law enforcement figures that get a gun and a badge, and are supposed to uphold the laws of this country felt so comfortable as to say some of the most hateful and derogatory things about people in peril, and elected officials of color, and women, and felt like they didn't, 'cause they're 10,000 people in the group. 
- Would they say it if they didn't have a Facebook group? In other words, did Facebook make them say these things, because these people had racist, sexist, misogynist things to say, so do we win if we get it off of Facebook? 
- No, but I think that we have to recognize the way that technology and new tools allows for this thing to be, for this information, to move quicker. Lighting a match is one thing. Lighting a match next to lighter fluid is a different thing. And in many ways, whether it's YouTube or Facebook or Twitter, these platforms can be the lighter fluid, so that means we have to keep an eye on it, and we have to pay special attention to how this information can spread in different ways. Yes, someone can say hateful things out on the street, and that's freedom of speech, and they, not without consequences for their job or the workplace, whatever, but it's freedom of speech. It's different when you go into a group. You are a law enforcement figure. You don't know the other 10,000 people on that group, and you feel so comfortable saying these things and doing these things. Yes there has to be accountability. There's accountability for all of us, in the workplace. 
- [Ali] Sure, if spoke out on a group like that, I'd probably get fired. 
- You'd probably get fired, and so the fact of the matter is why should we expect less from our law enforcement figures? Why should we let them off the hook when it comes to this, and especially as we see the images, the horrific images, that are coming from the border right now. We wanna make sure the very best people are engaged in this effort, and that's not what's happening. And the fact of the matter is, is once again, the technology that has so much potential to bring us together should not drag us in back.

- The 20 Democratic presidential candidates who were on the debate stage in Miami last week touched on a number of major issues, among them the economy, immigration, healthcare, and climate change. Do they matter to the voters who are gonna decide who's gonna get a chance to take on President Trump next year? A new Washington Post ABC news poll of Democratic leaning voters, finds that 89% of those surveyed said healthcare is their top issue in the 2020 election, just as it was in the 2018 election. Gun violence was next, followed by women's issues. If there's anybody in the audience who can read what those things say at the bottom, please let me, 'cause I can't tell. There we go! All right, immigration. There we go. Women's issues, immigration, then 80% at global warming, then the economy, foreign policy, abortion, and taxes was of the least concern to Democratic leaning voters. Joining me now to take a closer look at this is Dan Balz, Washington Post Chief Correspondent. Dan, good to see you. Thank you for joining us. 
- My pleasure, Ali. 
- Dan, the issue here is healthcare, and how big a deal it is to Democratic leaning voters, and how many of them actually support a Medicare for all proposal or some sort of it proposal. Morning Consult poll for support of Medicare for all shows that of all voters, a small majority support a Medicare for all system, 53%. 77% of Democrats do. Half of Independents do. And only 27% of Republicans do. So, it does seem that support for Medicare for all, or something like it, is a winning strategy for Democratic candidates. 
- Well, I think there's three questions. One is where do people stand on Medicare for all, or a government run single payer system, versus the current system. That's the first question that people are asked. The second is if you are in favor of Medicare for all or a government run system, would you be in favor of that if you knew that private insurance was gonna go away? What we found in our poll is that there is overwhelming support within the Democratic party among self identified Democrats and Democratic leaning independents for Medicare for all kind of program, and that 2/3 of Democrats say they would be in support of that even if it meant the end of private insurance. Among the hardcore of the Democratic party at this point, or among a broad scale of the Democratic party, there's quite a lot of support for it. We know that among the candidates, there are divisions on that. Vice President, former Vice President Biden is in one place. He is resistant to go that far. Senator Sanders, Senator Warren, and others, Senator Harris have come down strongly in favor of Medicare for all, even if that does mean the end of private insurance, although Harris has kind of equivocated on whether she's really in favor of that or would be in favor of maintaining some private insurance. That's gonna be the debate that we're gonna see play out. I think that the question for those who are opposed to Medicare for all, and an end to private insurance, how strongly do they make that case? One of the things we saw in the debate, Ali, was that Senator Bennet from Colorado, who opposes Medicare for all, made the argument that he is in favor of reaching universal care, but he thinks there's a more effective way to do it. That's the debate we're gonna see. 
- And Dan, most developed countries have some form of universal care, universal insurance coverage, and there are many ways to get at this. My sense is that by coming up for Medicare for all, which I happen to like as a Canadian, 'cause it's very similar to a single payer system in Canada, but it does sort of confuse the issue, because there are people who say they're in favor of Medicare for all, and then as you said, when you add in, as your poll did, add in the question of whether is that okay if you eliminate your private insurance, I think it's a lack of understanding that people have about the various competing systems that are not the one we have now. 
- Well, there's always going to be misunderstanding when you are talking about totally revamping the healthcare system. We saw that in the debate over the affordable care act during the Obama administration. We saw that during the debate over universal healthcare during the Clinton administration. Every time the federal government and congress have begun to tinker, or radically change the healthcare system, there is a lot of misunderstanding. There are a lot of concerns on the part of people who already have insurance. One of the realities is, as you know, under our Medicare system, there is private insurance. Most, if not all, Medicare recipients have or need some kind of additional insurance to pay for the costs that are not covered by Medicare. There are all these aspects of it, so part of it is a broad debate. What's the best way? I think one of the things I think the candidates have heard on the campaign trail is, beyond the question of what kind of system to do we have, the question is what does it cost? How much does it cost, and peoples' concern about rising cost. That's another issue that has to be dealt with. 
- So again, it's a little bit like the climate change debate. There's a question about what things cost, but there isn't a really good actuarial or mathematical calculation of the cost of inaction, or the cost of the current system. Would it be easier for people to digest if this were well priced out, the proposals were well priced out, and compared to, and this is what happens if you don't. 
- Well, that would be great, but as we've seen in past debates, getting those cost estimates, or getting people to agree on those cost estimates, is a very very difficult proposition. You get them coming from people with different ideological viewpoints and different political viewpoints, and different political interests. So, the debate over what the actual cost is, is as difficult sometimes as what is the structure of a new system versus the current system. 
- Dan, great to talk to you, as always. Thank you for your thorough coverage of this. Dan Balz, Washington Post Chief Correspondent. 
- Thank you.

- Hundreds gathered in New York City this morning to mourn the loss of a September 11th hero. 53 year old NYPD Detective, Luis Alvarez was laid to rest in Queens, New York this morning. He died Saturday in hospice care, following a three year battle with cancer, and more than 60 rounds of chemotherapy. Alvarez attributed his cancer to the three months he spent at Ground Zero, following September 11th attacks, digging through the rubble. He spent some of his final days on Capital Hill, pleading for extended benefits for his fellow 9/11 first responders. 
- I should not be here with you, but you made me come. You made me come because I will not stand by and watch as my friends with cancer from 9/11, like me, are valued less than anyone else, because of when they get sick, they die. 
- [Ali] Among the many who attended Alvarez's funeral, were comedian turned activist, John Stewart, who joined Alvarez and his fellow first responders on Capital Hill in the fight for extended health benefits. You see Stewart here, saluting Detective Alvarez in the final goodbye. Next to him, you see New York Congresswoman Carolyn Muloney, who was at Luis Alvarez's funeral this morning to pay her respects to the fallen hero. Congresswoman, thank you for being with us. 
- Well thank you for remembering, and thank you for remembering Detective Alvarez. 
- [Ali] What was it like at the funeral? What was the mood, given that he was a warrior, really. 
- There was a tremendous amount of support. The police department was there. Hundreds and hundreds of police. Not only from New York, but from other areas. His extended family. He was at the parish that he was raised in, and many many friends were there. It was a huge community gathering. 
- [Ali] He was born in Cuba, and came to American after that. 
- About six years old, but raised in Astoria, and this was his parish. So, he's the American dream. He came and as an immigrant, joined the marines, joined the police force, was a decorated officer, and a detective in narcotics, and then later in bombs. I'd say he's a hero, a true American hero, in working to pass the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund. 
- You remember back to those days. What did we get wrong about this when it came to the first responders. No one'll ever forget that day, when people were running as far as they could to get from those buildings, and some were lucky enough to get away, and first responders ran the other way. They ran into it. 
- They ran into it. 
- And they stayed. 
- And we lost 3,000 people, most of them responders on that day, and we will lose many more, thousands more, because of those that worked at the pile. And it's a double outrage, in a sense, because not only are they the victims of the war against terror, but our government said come back, it's safe. It's safe, come back and work. Well, of course, it's not. 
- The EPA had said it would be safe. And many of these people, we remember that plume that went on. It was much more than month that that
- 
- It went on six months. 
- And you could see it. You could smell it. 
- You could smell it, it was horrible. 
- They worried about that, they were going to do their jobs and they were going to continue to do their jobs. They worried that they were in danger at the time, and they were told by the government that it was safe. The federal government. So for those who say this was a New York problem, they were relying on information from the federal government to say, you're good, keep on working. 
- You've got it right, and so not only do we have the responsibility as they're the veterans against terror, but we also, they're the veterans of misinformation from the government that they served, and we can never repay what they gave. Their life, their health. This is one way we can make their lives better, and those of their families that many of them are leaving behind, and they aren't there to protect them. We need to give them some support. 
- [Ali] Do you believe this is going to get done? 
- I believe it's gonna get done, and I'm hoping we can get it on the floor for a vote next week, and send it over to the senate where Mitch McConnell says he hopes to pass it, and will pass it before the August recess. Let's keep him at his word. Let's get our work done in the house, and send the bill over to him.

- This is a legal alert for users of Roundup weed killer. In July 2018, a judge determined that all federal law suits could move forward, against Monsanto, the maker of Roundup weed killer, over concerns that those exposed are at risk for developing Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. And in three landmark verdicts, the most recent in May of 2019, for two billion dollars, one in March 2019 for 80 million, and another in August 2018 for 289 million, it was concluded that Roundup was responsible for the plaintiffs' Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Roundup weed killer is the most commonly used weed killer in American agriculture, with an estimated 85 to 90 million pounds used each year. If you or someone you love has been diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma after being exposed to Roundup or a Glyphosate herbicide, you may be entitled to compensation. How do you fight for the compensation you deserve? You choose the right legal team, that has the experience and resources to seek the most compensation for your injuries.

- We, in this hour, are remembering a man who revolutionized the American auto industry. Lee Iacocca has died of complications from Parkinson's disease. Iococca became Ford's president at 46 years old after a series of successes, including the creation of the Ford Mustang. He made his mark, though, as chairman of rival automaker, Chrysler. He saved the company from bankruptcy by introducing the fuel efficient K Car line, which changed how the auto industry operated, by allowing Chrysler to make different models of cars, using one-
