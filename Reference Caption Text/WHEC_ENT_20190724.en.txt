- Instances removed, and they don't have that privilege anymore, they're extremely upset. They have to rely on friends and neighbors and family. Families for rides. But I would say, as sheriff, my number one priority is keeping the road safe. 
- [Berkeley] I wanted to know how many reports are filed every year? How many drivers lose their license, and why does one person get a road test, like Rosalee, and another driver doesn't? The State DMV would not answer those specific questions, but wrote in an email, quote, The thorough review process allows a driver to demonstrate their fitness to drive and helps the DMV ensure safety on New York's roadways for all who use them, which is our top priority. How has this impacted your life? 
- I need to be independent. And I've always been independent. What can I say?

- [Reporter] Now, your First Alert forecast with meteorologist Robert Speta, featuring Rochester's only live local radar, First Alert Doppler 10, powered by AP Plumbing. 
- A rather nice evening out here in Rochester. This is overlooking the Genesee River there in Charlotte. We're still looking at nice weather through the rest of the week. It will start to warm up by the end of the week, and even become a little bit more muggy, with rain returning by Sunday night, into Monday. But here's the key thing, over the next few days, there is nothing severe in the forecast, and even into the weekend as well. I got green across the board here on that News 10 NBC threat tracker. But right now, any rain we had earlier on today, it's been pushed towards the south, thanks to the lake breeze, keeping things pretty clear through tonight. 60 degrees for our low, it's gonna be a pleasant night in the forecast. Heading through tomorrow, we're gonna be looking at those temperatures warming up to about 78 to 82 degrees, with mostly sunny skies by 5:00 p.m. By the way, that is Remo, or Rehmo, I hope I'm saying it right, I'm gonna say both of 'em. He a nice dog, he's ready to go for a ride there, on the dog walking forecast. Always do remember these images are sent in by that WHEC weather app. All right, let's take a look at those temperatures across the board for the high tomorrow. A little bit cooler near the lake shore, we got 79 in Irondequoit, 74 only in Sodus. Meanwhile, in the Canandaigua could be upwards of about 80 degrees for your high. You got the Ontario County Fair going on there. 80 in Geneva, and Dansville about 77 for your high. You have that chance of an isolated shower by the afternoon, down into the Finger Lakes as well. Be very, very local, because this high area of high pressure is finally gonna drift towards the East, and really just dominate, starting on Thursday and Friday, and also into Saturday. And the more it dominates, the less likely we have of scattered showers out there. So Thursday, there is a small chance. But then eventually by Friday into Saturday, this just comes on overhead. I know this is picking up on rain, but I don't have it on the forecast. I think this is gonna be suppressing it too much, but eventually this front is gonna work its way in by Sunday night into Monday. The high is gonna move out of the way, and that influence from it is gonna be going to the wayside, and of course, that means increase in rainfall, as we go ahead into the early part of next week. Especially Tuesday. Tuesday is looking like a messy one. 83, maybe even with a chance for thunderstorm with that. And Wednesday we're also looking at some rainfall, as well. But before that happens, boy oh boy, this week, this week's looking brilliant. I mean Thursday, Friday and Saturday, all of the sunshine. I think the only thing I could say that you need to worry about is the UV index. You definitely wanna be aware of that, get that sunblock ready to go as the sun just comes out. 
- Always 
- Yeah, yeah, especially this time of year. 
- Yeah, right. All right, Robert, thank you. Well, it's a sign that football season is almost here. What you need to know about the Buffalo Bills training camp, if you plan on going.
