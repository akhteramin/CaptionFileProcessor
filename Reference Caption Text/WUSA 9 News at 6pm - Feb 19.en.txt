- [Lesli] It's nearly at our doorstep. Topper what's the latest? 
- We're just hours from snow breaking out across the metro area, in fact, we're about 12 hours from snow in the metro. So let's go over the snow fall totals again, these are little bit lower than we showed you yesterday, doesn't mean the roads will be any better. Three to five inches Leesburg, Gaithersburg, Frederick, Martinsburg, and points north and west. And yes, you could exceed that three to five inch mark. One to three in the immediate metro area, DC, Rockville, Bethesda, Fairfax, Bowie, and even down into Waldorf. And in extreme southern Maryland, we're just talkin' about a trace to one. That hasn't changed that much, you just don't have the cold air in place long enough to sustain that much snow. Or that much sleet for that matter. So, what about the models? Have they come into my way of thinking? For the most part they have, still four and a half for the RPM. All the rest of the models are under three inches, so I think they've finally got a handle on just how much sleet is gonna fall with the snow. So once again, moderate to heavy snow, 6:00 am to noon. Roads will be dangerous, period. It will accumulate very quickly and once it starts it will pick up intensity very quickly. Snow will turn to a mix, north and west in the afternoon. It will turn to rain DC south and east in the afternoon. Some of that rain can be heavy overnight, everybody goes to rain overnight and then morning showers on Thursday and then we are in the 50s. No shortage of moisture. This is a tremendous storm, stretching already from Cape Hatteras back to Kansas city. Even all the way back to Iowa. So, here's the timing. 5:00 am, snow on our doorstep, but snowed already a couple hours in Culpeper, snowing already in Manassas. By 7:00, snowin' across the metro area, even in Prince George's county up into Baltimore. By 10:00 we still have snow beginning to mix down into the south. I think this mile's little slow in eroding the cold air. Still has snow by 1:00, I think we're gonna go probably to a mix in DC by noon, with the snow hanging on north up toward Frederick and I-70. Then by 4:00, just rain in the DC area, but still hanging onto some ice north and west. We'll come back, we'll talk about the potential for an ice storm north or west of town when the snow transitions from snow to freezing rain. 
- Thanks Topper. Preparations underway all across the DMV for the winter storm. Late tonight, salt and plow trucks will be standing by at the ready. Peggy Fox, she joins us from VDOT's massive operation. 
- [Peggy] Don't let these blooming pansies or daffodils pushing up fool you. Late February snow storms can pack a punch, with huge snowfalls. Are you ready for the snow? 
- No. 
- [Peggy] Ready or not, it's coming. Hardware stores have stocked up on shovels and sleds. 
- Whole new bunch, ready to rock and roll. 
- And in Virginia, VDOT has already started treating roads. You see those streaks on the road? They're from brine, put down overnight. This was one of VDOT's 18 facilities across northern Virginia. It looks empty now, but come midnight, it's gonna be rockin'. A continuous line of plow trucks will fill up from the salt dome to treat major roads. Sand will then be used in neighborhoods. VDOT's Ellen Kamilakis says they'll have 3,000 trucks covering 14,000 miles of roads. 
- Most of our fleet is a contract fleet. So these trucks are either landscaping trucks, they're construction trucks by day. When they go from Clark Kent to being Superman and they become our plow trucks at night. 
- [Peggy] Each truck needs a spreader. 
- The spreader goes in and is attached in there and then they get a load of salt and they drive off and as they drive and the unit spins in the back, it spreads salt evenly on the road. 
- Now, of course the trucks don't plow right away. They wait for a signal. As soon as snow gets two inches high, VDOT puts out the call, plows down, and then things get exciting. 
- What we're asking for this is for people to stay off the roads on Wednesday. With the amount of snow that we're gonna be getting and with the rate in which it's gonna be falling, we're concerned with that, especially during rush hour. 
- [Peggy] Stay home if you can. In Fairfax County, Peggy Fox, WUSA9. 
- [Bruce] And a reminder, because of the wintery weather we're expecting, the Wake Up Washington team will be on early, 4:00 in the morning we're talking, with the latest on conditions and closings because of the storm. 
- I'm Bernie Sanders. I'm running for President. 
- [Lesli] Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders made it official today. He's joining a crowded field competing for the democratic nomination for President. Sanders is the 10th candidate who wants to challenge President Trump in the 2020 election. In an interview with CBS This Morning's John Dickerson, the 77 year old progressive says, he's okay if people call him a radical. 
- I believe that people are inherently entitled to healthcare. I believe people are entitled to get the best education they can. 
- [Lesli] The Trump administration reacted to the announcement by Sanders saying, The American people will reject an agenda of sky high taxes, government run health care, and coddling dictators like those in Venezuela. Sanders says he does not want the US to become Venezuela and hopes Americans do not believe too much of what the President has to say. 
- Legal challenges are now mounting to President Trump and his declaration of a national emergency to fully fund that border wall. Natalie Brand breaks down the legal arguments against the President's move. 
- [Natalie] President Trump is defending his national emergency declaration to build a southern border wall. 
- I have an absolute right to call national security, we need strong borders. We have to stop drugs and crime and criminals. 
- [Natalie] But Professor Louis Michael Seidman of Georgetown University says the statistics may not be in the President's favor, as his declaration faces multiple legal challenges. 
- Border crossings are way down from where they were several years ago. Most of the drugs that the President worries about come through ports of entry. 
- 16 states, including California, are suing President Trump. Arguing that he does not have the constitutional authority to declare the emergency. A separate lawsuit from some members of Congress could also be coming on those same grounds. 
- Congress has pretty much expressly decided not to spend this money. 
- [Natalie] Much of that money will come from the Defense Department budget. Officials say DHS is already looking at construction locations. 
- We know there'll be a large portion of it being built in the Rio Grande Valley. 
- [Natalie] Which sets up another legal battle with Texas landowners, three of whom have already filed suit over possible land seizures. 
- Those people, more clearly maybe than anyone else, have standing to object to what the President has done. 
- [Natalie] Like the President and most legal experts, Professor Seidman expects the Supreme Court will ultimately decide the issue. Natalie Brand, CBS News, the White House. 
- A new NPR PBS news hour poll shows that, overall, a majority of Americans disapprove of the President's use of a national emergency to build the wall. 
- [Lesli] We're following some breaking news out of south east DC, it's been a violent afternoon there. A teenager has been shot. It happened along the 2600 block of Stanton Road. DC police tell us that boy was conscious and breathing when first responders rushed him to the hospital. We don't know what led up to the shooting. Police say they're looking for a suspect wearing a blue hoodie and tan khaki pants, last seen headed toward Douglas Road. About 20 minutes from there, earlier today, a crime alert about another crime. Three people, including a child, were shot in that instance. Eli Place, near the Fort Dupont ice arena. Bullet casings could be seen littering the street, along with a Lexus sedan that had it's windows shot out. Police say all but one of the victims was conscious and breathing when they were taken to the hospital. We don't know anything about a motive or suspects in that attack. 
- [Bruce] There's an important meeting at Winston Churchill Senior High School in Potomac tonight. Parents of the Montgomery County school are invited to discuss an event where students handed out passes granting others permission to use the N word. And there's more.

Coming up, Frederick County mom detained by immigration officers talks about her nightmare and her long awaited reunion with her family.

- A Jewish cemetery was found desecrated today in eastern France. Swastika's and inscriptions were found on some 80 graves in a village located close to Strasbourg. This comes two months after another Jewish cemetery was vandalized and on the day that France held a large gathering in Paris to protest antisemitism. French President, Emmanuel Macron, also visited the Holocaust Memorial today in the city. 
- [Bruce] CBS news has confirmed the Vatican has kept secret guidelines for priests who father children. For nearly nine centuries the catholic church has forbidden it's priests from having sex or getting married. Sarah Thomas says she's proof that priests sometimes break those vows. She says her mother was told by the church to keep her birth a secret. Thomas first met her father, a priest, in England when she was 14 years old. 
- It soon became apparent that he couldn't, or wouldn't, and wasn't allowed to be any sort of father to me. 
- What was the hardest part about all of this growing up? 
- Feeling very isolated. I literally thought I was the only priest child in the world. 
- [Bruce] The Catholic church in Ireland published ground breaking guidelines for priests who fathered children. Church officials in America are now looking at a similar model. This week, Pope Francis meeting in Rome with Bishops to discuss this issue and the sexual abuse scandals that have plagued the church on several continents. Coming up at 7:00 Off Script tonight, I've got an exclusive interview with a priest and church scholar who is heading to that meeting in Rome. 
- [Lesli] Coming up, Manny Machado has a new team now. How will that impact Bryce Harper? Darren Haynes has more from Nat's Spring Training camp in Florida.

- A Frederick County mom and local civil rights leader at the center of an immigration battle is reunited with her kids. Roxana Santos broke down today as she talked about the terror of being detained by ICE for nearly a month despite a federal judge's order blocking her deportation. Here's Scott Broom. 
- [Scott] Roxana Santos, speaking in Spanish, said she's now living in terror that she could be taken from her four kids again at any moment. The three youngest, including six year old twins, are U.S. citizens. 
- [Roxana's Son] I'm happy to be with my mom. 
- [Translator] I'm really scared that they could separate me from my children again. 
- [Scott] Santos was taken by ICE, locked up in a rural county jail, and threatened with deportation in January, sparking protest. 
- [Scott] She just won a civil rights suit against the Frederick County sheriff's department for illegally profiling her, leading to an unjustified arrest in 2007. The final stage of that case is still in court, the reason a judge blocked her deportation for now. Nick Katzs is Santos' lawyer. 
- Immigration has no priorities anymore. They're going after mothers, they're going after young people. We need to protect them and make sure that they're comfortable interacting with the local police and that that's not a pipeline to deportation. 
- Santos may have U.S. citizen kids, but the fact is she did illegally immigrate 14 years ago to flee violence in El Salvador. Which means ICE is within its rights to attempt to separate the family again. In Hyattsville, Scott Broom, WUSA9. 
- All right, so a lot of schools, are already calling it now. 
- And for good reason. I mean, the roads are going to be a mess tomorrow. Between 6:00 am and noon that's gonna be the big shot of snow, and the heaviest snow, and it's gonna accumulate quickly. We talked about this yesterday. When it starts to snow it will become moderate to heavy very soon, and it will accumulate very quickly as well. So here we go. Three to five. Leesburg, Gaithersburg, just north of Rockville, and just kinda touching parts of Fairfax County and northern Prince William County. And notice the plus sign. Yeah, there are spots that could get more than five inches in that. In the metro area, one to three inches. We may end up with two inches of snow and an inch of sleet inside the belt way. So that includes Bethesda, Chevy Chase, DC, Bowie, down to Waldorf, and even Fredericksburg. Down to the south of Fredericksburg, across into the southern Maryland area, we have a trace to just an inch. Not a huge problem there. But if you're traveling, you're gonna try to come up through southern Maryland, up five or 301, once you get into Charles County, if you're doing it in the morning, it will be bad. Snow fall. Here we go. I think the computers have kinda come into our way of thinking, which is good. Makes me feels a little bit more confident. All right, so here we go. Tremendous amount of moisture. Most of this is rain, little bit of snow popping up here in northwestern North Carolina, in the mountains. And this is on schedule for us to be here either side of 6:00 tomorrow. So, on the Bread-O-Meter. Well, I like doin' a pure snow on the Bread-O-Meter, but because it's gonna be a impactful storm, and disruptive, we're gonna make it a five. So we're gonna call it a legitimate storm. Between the snow and the ice. And I think it will be plowable and sledable. Now, as it goes to ice, power outages, I think unlikely in the metro, but out toward I-81, isolated power outages, okay? And then further west, Hagerstown into Cumberland, kinda where you had the ice about a week ago, we could see power outages there. We're a little bit more concerned about power outages there. And here's why. This model has very little ice around the metro, and it has okay amounts, it could probably handle 2/10 of Petersburg and 2/10 of Romney. But this model's way aggressive and it has almost an inch in Cumberland to Oakland. And even more in our burgs. 0.3 in Leesburg and Gaitersburg. That would lead to some blims coming down and some power outages. So, let's talk about types of precip. So it's snow if everything is cold, and we start out that way, but it doesn't stay that way. It ends up we get this little warm wedge and that turns things to sleet. That's what bounces. And worst of all, if we it turn to freezing rain that falls liquid and freezes on contact. That's the worse case scenario. So, roads worse 6:00 am to noon. It will kick to a mix and then rain overnight. And then morning showers, we're in the 50s by Thursday. So, 33 snow at 6:00 am, moderate to heavy snow at 9:00, and then things begin to change a little bit into a mix. So, red weather alert tomorrow 32, 56 on Thursday. Look at Friday, what a way to finish the week! Sunshine and-
- Little bit of a blip of Saturday, chilly with rain. And then 66 on Sunday. Upper 40s Monday and Tuesday. Lesli. 
- [Lesli] All right, four wedding anniversaries, birthdays and countless holidays have passed since Ken Gemmell and his little girl, Arabelle, lost their family. It was two weeks before Christmas in 2014, a plane crashed into their Gaitersburg house. And inside was Marie. She was home on maternity leave. She was found cradling her sons, seven week old Devon, and three year old Cole, in an upstairs bathroom. But instead of letting this tragedy destroy them, Ken and Arabelle are fulfilling a dream to honor Marie, Devon, and Cole. They wanna rebuild this playground, and you can help. To learn how, go to WUSA9, our mobile app or our website, and then tonight at 11:00 hear about the design plans little Arabelle has to honor her mother and little brothers. We'll be right back.

- [Announcer] And now, WUSA9 Sports brought to you by Xfinity. 
- WUSA9 Sports Director Darren Haynes, he's at spring training with the Nats, and three things you just need to know about. 
- I'm Darren Haynes at Nationals' spring training and here are three things you need to know. Bryce Harper is not in West Palm Beach. The free agent has yet to sign with a Major League team. The Nationals reportedly already offered him a 300 million dollar deal over ten years, the same as the Phillies, who offered him a ten year contract for 310 million. How much do you want him on this team? 
- Oh, I want him on this team, and the guys in the clubhouse want him on this team. He's one of the best players in the game right now. And people in and around this organization have had a front row seat to really see how good of a player he is. But at the end of the day we can't be sitting around waiting for him to walk through those doors. 
- Here's the second thing you need to know. There's another big free agent out there, people. Or should I say, use to be free agent? Former Oriole, Manny Machado, signed a ten year, 300 million dollar contract with the Padres. So what does this all mean? This could accelerate things for Bryce Harper to sign with a team. I spoke to Nationals manager, Davey Martinez, and he says Bryce Harper needs to focus on what's best for his family. But at the same time he's gonna focus on the players that are here at spring training. Speaking of Davey Martinez, here's something you didn't know about him for number three. Hidden talent. 
- I can play the bongos. 
- Now, these are not bongos, but... 
- You tap a little bit? 
- [Darren] Can you? 
- Can you tap? 
- Who taught you that? 
- My dad. 
- Great. 
- Yeah. 
- Good stuff, good stuff. See, we learned something new today. Now coming up at 11:00 tonight, why was today almost like a family reunion for manager Davey Martinez? Reporting from West Palm Beach, I'm Darren Haynes, WUSA9 Sports. 
- [Bruce] Darren's gonna be with Nats spring training in Florida all week long. He's gonna bring you live exclusive access to the players in our WUSA9 Facebook page. 
- Oh, Darren, he's missing all this tomorrow. For shame. 
- Picked a good week. And speaking of Facebook Live, Howard's on there now if you wanna ask him questions about the snow and the sleet and the freezing rain. 
- Okay. 
- So we'll show you the snow fall map again. We have tailored it down a bit. Three to five north and west with a plus sign. One to three in the metro. A trace to an inch down into the northern neck and also southern Maryland. But I do want to emphasize, if you're driving up from southern Maryland, from Saint Mary's County through Charles County tomorrow around 9:00, 10:00, it's gonna be bad. It's gonna start to snow quickly, it will accumulate quickly, and it will become heavy also rather quickly. But, once we get through that we're okay. We're 56 on Thursday, 50s on Friday, and let's just jump ahead to 66 on Sunday. 
- If some of you can stay off the road for one day, I would do it. That's News at 6:00. Back at 7:00 with Off Script.
