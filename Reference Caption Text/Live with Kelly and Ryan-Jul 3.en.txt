He was gonna be my union member.

- You're making me more of a sound than... (laughs) 
- (laughs) Well, happy Fourth of July, Keripa. 
- Thank you. 
- I was reading this about, you know, thank you for tuning in in the morning. I don't know what your morning routines are, your morning habits are, but there's a whole article on surprising morning habits that can give you more anxiety. And, just by reading it, I got more anxiety. 
- Right, of course. You saying the word anxiety 
- Gives you-
- 
- Gave me anxiety. 
- Cortisols releasing right now, isn't it? Right now, yeah. 
- Is cortisol releasing into your system? 
- Yeah. 
- Well let it out. 
- That's why I stopped wearing pants with a zipper. Yeah, can't do it. 
- That's the reason? 
- That's the reason. 
- Oh! 
- I can't do it. I can't work in live TV, and have a waistband. No waist anymore. I'm like, forget it. The cortisol spikes, it's not gonna affect me 
- Well, listen-
- 
- 'Cause my dress is just gonna widen. 
- Do you jump-
- They say it's bad for you to jump right outta bed. Like to get right outta bed is bad. It causes a spike in all of that. 
- Well. 
- Do you jump right out? Or do you lay there for, I lay there and moan for a minute. 
- I usually set snooze. I do one snooze, but-
- 
- I find it to be painful. 
- The snooze? 
- Yeah. 'Cause I know it's coming and I can't, you know, it's like that anxiety? 
- Yeah, but I like that. It's like (stammers) I hit snooze, but the whole time, I'm quasi-awake, and knowing that-
- 
- It's coming? But see, that gives me anxiety, knowing it's coming. 
- I just burped, and that gave me anxiety. 
- By the way... Can I say, that garlic smells great. 
- Oh, no, it's not. It's not garlic. 
- No, I know. (laughs) I know it's not garlic. Doing household chores... Gives you anxiety, so quit. 
- Wait, that gives you anxiety? Household chores? 
- Yeah. 
- Knowing you have-
- 
- At the start of your day, at the start of, this is all at the beginning of the day. 
- Oh, they're saying don't do it at the start of the day. 
- Yeah, don't do it at the beginning of the day. Don't look at your work email the second you get outta bed. Don't look at your to-do list. Don't skip breakfast. 
- I mean, I do all of that. 
- I know, right? 
- I do every-
- 
- But, you get to wear a dress, and it's all fine. 
- Well, I mean, they make it look fine 
- There's no waist band. 
- I liken myself to a Westminster show dog. Yeah, it looks very fluffy on the outside. But, on the inside, it's like, is this done yet? Can we just... Can you please put me back in my cage? I just wanna... I don't wanna stand before the judges right now. 
- I do find looking at the phone, I try not to do it first thing. Which is hard sometimes, because you're turning off your alarm, and then all this stuff is there. 
- I have to look at it, because usually he's either texted me, or you've texted me over some thing that's happened in the middle of the night. 
- Some inane thing. 
- Yeah, some thing that has happened. 
- That's true. 
- So I have to check it first thing in the morning. You know, it's not just my dad's birthday today, okay? I want you to know it's also another national holiday. 
- What is that? 
- A special day. 
- And, I believe it could become an international holiday, if we get it trending here. It is National Compliment Your Mirror Day. 
- [Gelman] Oh, my goodness! 
- Yes. Yes. Lady in the front row's like, no, it is not. Oh, yes, it is. You wanna know how it works? Watch this. 
- Okay. 
- Kay, you hold this. 
- I'm not complimenting a picture of me. 
- You hold it. 
- Here. 
- Gelman, you wanna do it too? And, I'll read? 
- Sure, I can do it, yeah. 
- Yes. You stand next to Ryan. I wanna see who does-
- 
- Gelman celebrates this every day. 
- Oh, I know! Trust me, I know. 
- Yeah, yeah. 
- Here's what you do, everybody. Stand in front of your mirror 
- Oh God. 
- With your eyes closed. That's the key. 
- That's the key. Close your eyes. 
- Turns the lights off. 
- Yeah. Put a big smile on your face. Eyes closed, big smile. Now, open your eyes. 
- No! I don't wanna see it, no. 
- Wow, isn't the picture of the person in the mirror absolutely stunning? 
- Oh, yes! 
- Who's making love to themself over here? What is going on? 
- Don't let this special holiday be overshadowed by the 4th of July. 
- No! I'm feeling very positive. 
- I have to tell you, I actually-
- 
- Make sure you compliment your mirror for displaying the beautiful person... 
- Oh, God. 
- Thank you, mirror! What a great mirror you are! 
- Gag, gag, gag. 
- You're my favorite mirror. You're a good mirror. 
- Okay, Gelman. 
- All right, goodbye. 
- Thank you, Gelman. 
- I was reading this article about smartphones at the gym. I guess, if you go to the gym and work out, the gyms want you to post that you're working out at the gym. Because, they get good free publicity, and marketing. 
- Well, especially your gym where all the models go. 
- Woo! 
- (laughs) Yeah. 
- That's why-
- 
- It looks like a Victoria Secret shoot every time. I'm like, oh, there's Ryan at his gym again. 
- Hey, look, it's the only gym that has enough weight for me. 
- [Gelman] Oh, woo! Three pounders? 
- Yeah, I have the little pink ones you hold. 
- Do they make sounds? 
- Yeah, they make shaker sounds. 
- They make sounds. 
- To some Daddy Yankee music. 
- Ooh wee 
- But this article is about gym etiquette. They say, don't Face-time or Skype in front of other people. No photos in the locker room. 
- Oh, yeah, naw. 
- No. Wait until after a class to ask the instructor for the selfie. Now, what I find... People do in the gym, is they take their phone, 
- Yeah. 
- And they set it up over here, you know? 
- Yeah. And, they record. 
- Then, they go over here to do curls, 
- Right. 
- And then, you walk through their shot and (scoffs). 
- Yeah, well, guess what? 
- I mean, what? 
- Guess what? That's exactly their problem, not your problem. 
- Yeah, exactly. 
- Because that is a, (stammers) the floor, this is gonna sound like a shock to all the millennials, the floor is for a walking. 
- Well, the good-
- 
- It's not an imaginary tripod for you to lean your cellphone, so you can have a selfie, so you can remember, so you can be nostalgic in real time. Right? 
- Listen, these are the people that are celebrating the mirror day all day today. So, they won't be at the gym. 
- That's right. That's right, they're taking a day off today. 
- They're taking the day off to just celebrate themselves, again. 
- Yes, that is true. 
- Shall we, are we? 
- Sure, we could do that. I mean, I do have my study on insomnia. 
- [Gelman] Oh! 
- Do it. 
- You wanna know why we're so, why we're such insomniacs? 
- Why are we such insomniacs? 
- Embarrassing thoughts keep us awake at night. 
- I think just thoughts. Like a sum of all thoughts keep me awake. 
- Well, that's what I said. 
- Like everything happens. 
- I was like thoughts keep me awake at night. Not necessarily embarrassing thoughts because-
- 
- Just like a flow. 
- I am a human experiment, that you cannot die from embarrassment. 
- You are, that's correct. 
- I'm still here, right. 
- You are good on that. 
- But... They are saying that like, daily blunders can creep into the margins of our brain. And so, we fall asleep, but suddenly, the thought of something mortifying that happened during the day creeps in. 
- It does. 
- Right. 
- It does but there's 40 other thoughts happening at the same time. 
- Right. 
- So one by one, shh, I try and quiet them. 
- Right. 
- Shh, then the alarm goes off. It's morning (murmurs). I'm still trying to quiet them. 
- You're trying to quiet that? 
- I'm trying to quiet. 
- Yeah. 
- You know, I mean, I try to quiet the thought. It's hard to do sometimes. 
- I always worry that I've hurt somebody's feelings and that creeps back to me, you know? You know my sense of humor. Sometimes I'll... 
- Yeah. 
- I'll use some of my best stuff on people I don't know that well, and they're like. 
- And they don't, right. 
- And I go, no, I'm kidding. See, that's my... 
- That's my personality. 
- And then, that creeps in at night. And I go, oh, I don't think so and so got my humor at the funeral tonight. Right? 
- No, I've never had that happen. Today, on the show? 
- Yeah, we have a great show. 
- Kate Hudson is here. 
- Yeah. 
- Woo! 
- You ready for Kate Hudson? 
- Pitbull is also here! 
- Winston Duke is here.

- Yeah, that's good. 
- So, you should win bonus points. 
- We hope so. 
- Yes! 
- Just for that. 
- Bonus points, yes! 
- So, you're gonna give us two statements. 
- Okay. 
- Alright? 
- Alright. 
- And we're gonna try and guess which is true. If you stump us, you win. 
- Okay. Alright, this is gonna be hard. 
- Okay. 
- Okay, all right, here we go. The first lie or, no, the first truth or lie is, growing up, we had a houseboat. On Norris Lake, in Knoxville, Tennessee. My family had a boat, and we would all ski. We would all do it. There would four of us, sometimes five. We would all line up, and we would do pyramids. 
- Behind the houseboat? 
- Behind the house, well, not the houseboat, 'cause we had a boat, but we kinda just-
- 
- So you had a houseboat, and a ski boat. 
- Right, so we would go out, and we would ski out, and sometimes we would compete. We were the McMichaels. We would travel, and do local competitions. 
- [Ryan] All right, what's the second one? Then, we'll start asking questions. 
- The second one is I was Miss Tiny Tot of Tennessee. And, on 4th of July, I would do the 4th of July parade, and sit on the convertible, and wave to the crowd. 
- Oh, wave. 
- Yeah, yeah. 
- Okay. Let me see your parade wave. 
- Well, it was bad, 
- Okay. 
- Because, my mom told me I would wave like this to everybody and they're like, no, no, no, you got to give it. You got to give it good. 
- You really have to use the whole arm. 
- And, how old were you when you were Miss Tiny Tot? 
- I was seven. 
- Seven. 
- Is Miss Tiny Tot-
- 
- I don't care. 
- A real thing? 
- I want her to be Miss Tiny Tot because... I think you're Miss Tiny Tot on this show! 
- Is there a Miss Tiny Tot circuit out there? 
- Miss Tiny Tot! 
- It is very rare that I am bigger than somebody. 
- I am tiny, yes, yes! So, you are our Miss Tiny Tot. 
- What does the audience have to say about this? 
- Oh! 
- Oh, wow! 
- Oh, wow! 
- I mean, they really believe you have all those boats. 
- But, I want her to be Miss-
- Oh, what is going on right now? 
- It's staying 80/20. 
- I wanna believe that she. 
- Do you wanna go with it, Kel? 
- [Woman] Go with what you-
- 
- You know, it's your father's birthday. 
- Alright, lock it in. 
- You go with what you want. 
- Uh-uh. I'm not gonna say a word. 
- Alright, let's just say that, I'll go with the audience, and say that she was part of a water skiing troop. 
- Is that true? 
- No, I was Miss Tiny of Tennessee. You wanted me to be Miss Tiny Tot, and I was! I was Miss Leprechaun, too. 
- You were? 
- Oh, yeah. I had multiple titles. 
- Oh, my gosh!

- Three. 
- Three, yeah. Or, five-
- I say 500. It's like, 
- It feels like I have 500 kids. That's what it feels like. 
- Well, you go from man-to-man defense, to zone-defense. 
- Yeah. 
- Woo. 
- And, I don't know what that means. It just seems like it (mumbles) up a lot. 
- Oh my God. Everyone's like, how are you? And I'm like, exhausted. I'm so tired. 
- How old, is this six months? The latest addition? 
- Ope, she's six months. Yesterday. 
- Oh, so cute! 
- Oh my gosh 
- Look at her little thighs. 
- That's-
- 
- [Kate] Oh my God, you guys. I'm out of my mind. 
- Do you ever, do you chew on her legs? Do you chew on her? 
- I chew on everything. 
- Mhm. 
- (stammers) I mean, we're all out of our minds with Rani. 
- Yeah. 
- She's so cute. 
- I love your copper pans though, those are nice. 
- Oh yeah? 
- Yeah. 
- Copper pans? You noticed pans? 
- I have copper pans. 
- Yeah, she has beautiful copper pans. 
- I actually collect copper. 
- Oh, you do? 
- Yeah. 
- Oh well, see. 
- And, I engrave them, and everything. 
- Look at that. 
- [Kate] Yeah. 
- That is so cute. 
- It's so funny, I was so busy looking at the, I was like, copper pans? 
- Oh, yeah. 
- Ryan's like, nice copper pans. 
- Yeah. I'm installing a kitchen right now. 
- Are her big brother's involved? Or, are they at the place where they're like, oh that's, you know, that's a diaper? 
- Ryder's 15. 
- Yeah. 
- Which is crazy. 
- I mean it's like, 
- That's insane. 
- I mean, he's almost (stammers), getting up to six-feet. And, he's such a great boy. 
- He's a man. 
- Young man. 
- Yeah. 
- (laughs) It's okay. 
- But, the other day we were-
- 
- I do it all the time. 
- I know, I'm like, what is it? He's so old. But no, the other day, we went to breakfast, and I was juggling a million things. And, I think it's like, you know, really wise to go alone, with three kids. You know, it's like hey, let's go to breakfast, kids. And, the next thing you know, I'm not eating, I'm juggling everything, and I go to Ryder, Ryder, just take Rani. And, I went to go get my food at the buffet, and I looked over, and here's this young man holding his sis-
- It was the craziest image to me. 
- Yeah. 
- And, I just thought, life is really weird. 
- And, it goes fast. 
- It's so fa-
- Yeah, but I was like 12 when I-
- I mean-
- 
- You were 12 when-
- 
- Yeah, in terms of like, a Hollywood actress. 
- Right. 
- Yeah. 
- I say, in terms of a Hollywood actress, I was like a teen-mom. I mean, that's, you know. 
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
- Yeah, me and Reese were like teen-moms. 
- Yeah, that's true. 
- You know, it's like, we had kids really, super young. 
- But you... I mean, just from your posts, you don't let being a busy mom not have you have fun. Like, you still like really-
- 
- Hold on... 
- Yeah. You know what I mean? 
- Yeah. 
- Like, you still are you. 
- But, don't you think you learn that from your family? Like, your family... 
- Is-
- 
- When I look at your family, it's with admiration and envy, 'cause you all seem like you're having fun all the time. 
- All the time. 
- Yeah, my parents left us to have fun all the time. It was like, where are you going? They're like, we're going to Tahiti! Okay. 
- See you in two weeks! 
- Yeah, exactly. Yeah, we do. We have fun. I mean, I make sure that 
- You embrace it. 
- You know, kids are good, and that I take time to you know, let out some steam. 
- To enjoy. 
- Yeah. 
- Although, lately it's been hard, 'cause I'm still breast feeding. I gotta be honest. 
- Yeah. 
- It's like, my 40th is coming up, and I keep saying, (stammers) I deserve a really good hangover. 
- Yes. 
- And, it's gonna happen. 
- Listen, I wanna give you a birthday present. I will watch your children so you can go tie one on. I will do the whole-
- 
- And, I'll go... I'll go tie one on with you. 
- That's good, perfect! 
- I will take care, I will take care of your babies. I'm very responsible. So now, there's (stammers). 
- Break it down. 
- Musicians in your family. You're very musical. 
- I love to sing. 
- Yeah. 
- And, I play piano. 
- I didn't know that. 
- Yeah, but it's like, I keep forgetting I can't swear on these shows. I almost went there. I'm not very good at it. I can write on the piano, but I can't like sit down, and read music, 
- Wow. 
- And be like, you know. 
- Yeah. 
- Why don't you release a single? 
- I have a movie coming out. I think it's gonna be in the Fall, that's a musical that Sia directed. 
- Oh. 
- Oh, wow. 
- Yeah, it's the first time I've actually sang contemporary music. That's really exciting. And, I think after that, I'll probably even just (stammers). I feel like it's one of those things I have to do at some point. I just have to put something out there. 
- Listen-
- 
- I don't care what it does-
- 
- You know people that work on the radio. 
- Oh yeah, that's right. 
- Yeah. 
- Oh, that guy. 
- I tell ya' how to make it a hit. 
- Yeah? 
- Collaborate with DJ Khalid. 
- Right. 
- That's right. 
- That's all you gotta do. Just get DJ Khalid, Kate Hudson-
- 
- Or, Mr. WorldWide. 
- Or, Mr. WorldWide! 
- Mr. WorldWide. 
- Mr. WorldWide. 
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
- I got it. You know what though? I have to say, I miss bands. I really do. Like, my son's really musical. Bing is insane-
- (stammers) Almost... He drums. I can't get him out of his drumming room. 
- That's great. 
- He's now started playing keyboard, and he's never had a piano-
- Oh yeah, he's not even eight years old. 
- He's got it in the genes. 
- It's kind of crazy. And, I just thought... Oh, he's gonna get in a band, and like, ugh, it's gonna be tough (laughs). 
- Yeah, yeah. He's gonna tour the world. 
- It's gonna be a hard life. 
- No, but it's an exciting life. Don't you think? 
- Being (stammers) a touring musician? 
- Well, she was-
- 
- Yeah, but I mean-
- 
- You have some experience with that. 
- I mean, it's a lot of work. You know? 
- Yeah. 
- And, it's amazing when you love it. But, it's a whole different like-
- Jazz Cats. 
- Oh. 
- Like, all the people that I'm really close to, and touring musicians who still spend 200 days of the year on the road. 
- On the road. 
- But, I'm thinking about your parents, right. They were probably like, oh gosh, not acting. It's such a, like an unstable career, right? If you have a calling for it. 
- Yeah, do it. 
- Imagine if your mom said to you, Kate listen, anything but acting. 
- Yeah. 
- Right? 
- That would have been very, yeah. It would have been hard-
- 
- But, you're entrepreneuring. I mean, you've got all of these fashion brands-
- 
- I just can't stop working. 
- Great! 
- I love to work, and-
- 
- [Kelly] Well, you're good at it. 
- I've always wanted to design clothes. 
- What's Happy By Nature? 
- So, Happy By Nature is my first like, ready-to-wear fashion line. 
- It's fantastic. I'm so happy for you. 
- Thank you, I'm really excited. I'm excited. It's one of those things I've been working really hard on it. I feel like every time I put my name to anything, whether I'm endorsing it, or banking it, like this. 
- Right. 
- I have to believe in it. It has to be something that I feel is important. And so, this is a very eco-friendly line, and the fashion industry is like the worst, number two worst carbon footprint of all industries. And, I really feel like the fashion industry needs to look at how they're making things, and start changing the way that they do stuff. And, I feel like we-
- Yeah. 
- Well-
- 
- And, I feel like we're gonna really, hopefully make an impact there. 
- Well, you're a nature girl. So, you grew up... 
- Yeah. 
- In nature, really. 
- Yeah. 
- I mean-
- 
- In Brentwood. 
- In Brent-
- 
- No, but she also, Colorado. 
- No. 
- She's a Colorado girl. 
- Colorado. 
- Oh, Colorado, okay. 
- And then, Brentwood. 
- Then Brentwood. 
- [Kelly] Yeah. 
- There's a median of grass. 
- Yeah, yeah. 
- This is beautiful. 
- Thank you. 
- So, you can go to our website for more information about Kate's fashion line, Happy By Nature. Great to see you. 
- [Announcer] Still ahead, on Live, we'll talk with Pitbull. [Music] Excuse me, excuse me [Music] 
- I remember putting on a brave face to hide my symptoms of depression. I was on an anti-depressant, but I still had depression symptoms. It was tough getting through the day, hiding how I really felt. Something had to change. So, I talked to my doctor, for real. No more saying oh, I'm fine. This time, I spoke up about living behind the mask. And, he told me about Rexulti. He said that Rexulti, when added to an anti-depressant, has been proven to help reduce symptoms of depression. Without giving up the progress I may have made on my anti-depressant. 
- [Narrator] Rexulti is not for everyone. Call your doctor about unusual changes in behavior, worsening depression, or thoughts of suicide. Anti-depressants can increase these in those 24, and younger. Elderly dementia patients taking Rexulti have an increased risk of death or stroke. Call your doctor if you have high-fever, stiff muscles, and confusion, to address a possible life-threatening condition. Or, if you have uncontrollable muscle movements, as these may be permanent. Rexulti has been shown to increase blood-sugar in some people. Other risks are increased cholesterol, weight gain, unusual urges or compulsive behaviors, decreased white blood-cells, which can be serious, dizziness on standing, seizures, trouble swallowing, and impaired judgment or motor skills. 
- It was time to make a change. That's why I asked my doctor about adding Rexulti. 
- [Narrator] Feel better about facing the world. Pay $0 for your first Rexulti prescription. Details at rexulti.com.

- Right? 
- He is a Grammy winning, international super-star. Mr. 305, Mr. WorldWide. Please welcome Pitbull. 
- Got 'em. Got 'em, got 'em, got 'em, got 'em. 
- Hi! How are you? 
- Yes, sir. 
- Good to see you, baby. 
- Yes, sir. 
- Love it. I mean, the fans. The fans go nuts. 
- Yeah. 
- Armando fans are here. 
- (mumbles) Yee-ooh! I think I got the wrong glasses on. 
- Oh yeah, yeah. 
- Are these your glasses? 
- Oh my gosh. I know, I'm sorry. You look-
- 
- Studious. 
- But, I can see everybody really close right now. 
- Sorry about that. Sorry (laughs). 
- So listen... 
- Boom, there we go. 
- To go back for people who don't know your story. 
- Yeah. 
- It is an incredible story. 
- Been very blessed, thank God. Thanks for the fans. I wouldn't be here without y'all. 
- I wanna talk about-
- The challenges at the beginning for you, and what you did to overcome, to get to be who you are now. 
- Well, I mean... Oof.. A lot of different obstacles, but I think that, that's what makes the journey fun. You know, from nothing to something. A whole lot of no's. 
- Yeah. 
- That's for sure. And, a whole lot of you can't, you won't, you never will, don't, you're crazy, how dare you, impossible. And then, I flipped every word, by the way. 
- Yeah. 
- So, my daughter taught me, in the word impossible, is possible. 
- Yeah. 
- Right? And, I took the word can't, is can. 
- Yeah. 
- Won't, is won. 
- Yes. 
- Don't, is do. 
- Yes. 
- And, that's exactly what we doin' with our career. 
- It's really-
- 
- 20 years in the game, baby. 
- 20 years too. 
- Yeah. 
- Isn't that great? 
- Amazing. 
- You got your first record deal from a rap battle. 
- Yeah, it was a rap battle against, back in the day, was a crew called The Ruff Ryders. A guy named DMX 
- Yes, of course. 
- Was a part of it. 
- Yeah. 
- I was very, I was invited to his video shoot, and I battled this guy named Drag-on, at the video shoot, Swizz Beatz was there. 
- Mhm. 
- And, Swizz Beatz told me I'll give you three rounds with the Drag-
- 'Cause, he's a dragon, you know. He's gonna burn you. I said man, I'm just happy to be here. 
- [Kelly] Right. 
- I had home-court advantage. It was in Miami. 
- Yeah. 
- Yeah. 
- Okay. And, I flipped a couple words in Spanish here and there. Called out a couple neighborhoods. It worked out, you know? And, we won (laughs). 
- Oh my gosh, that's great. 
- Yeah. 
- And, that's where it all started? 
- Yup. You know what's crazy, is that's on video. And the footage, you can't find it anywhere. 
- Really? 
- Crazy enough, yeah. There's a guy out there, Jamie, if you're looking at this, I know you still got that footage (mumbles). 
- [Kelly] Jamie! 
- Let's go, cough it up. 
- You need to show the world that, Jamie. 
- I would love to see that. 
- Oh, you will. You will. 
- Yeah. 
- Now that I said that, you'll see it. It'll get out, one way or another. 
- And also, when you were growing up, 
- Yeah. 
- Your mom would put on tapes of Tony Robbins 
- Yup. 
- In the car, right? 
- So, I lived in a neighborhood called Carol City, in Miami. 
- Yeah. 
- And... I was not trying to listen to Tony Robbins. And, whenever my mom could take me to school, it was an '82 Pinto that she would take me to school in, and she said, she put Tony on. I wanted to hear like, 2 Live Crew, and Poison Clan. So, one day I go to change the radio to, you know, to my music, and she's like, (smack), bam. She said, do you pay for this car? I said, no. She said, well then don't touch my radio. 
- And so, you were listening to Tony Robbins? 
- So, subliminally, I started listening to Tony, and all it took was one story. Which was a story about Colonel Sander's, and how it took him 1,007 no's before he could sell his recipe. And, I thought about it like, man it's hard to get one no out of my mom. I go, man, imagine 1,007 of 'em. So, the word no became yes. You know, I welcome failure. I welcome the slip. I welcome the fall. I welcome the no. I mean, you guys know. 
- Yeah, of course. 
- You know, and failure's the mother of all success. And, I've learned that through out the game. Every record that has been huge for us around the world, thanks to you guys, every record exec said, mmm not gonna work. So, the minute that they don't say that's a hit, I'm like, ope, throw that out the window. 
- We get it. 
- Yes. It's true. 
- Yeah, yeah. 
- It's true. I mean, you've had... It's like... I had the fortunate opportunity to play Pitbull's music every single day. 
- Right, I put you on one of the records. 
- He put me in a lyric. 
- Yeah. 
- I was so excited. 
- Wait, wait, wait, what lyric? 
- It says... It was... Give me everything... 
- Which was a huge (mumbles) 
- Where I said my family's from Cuba, but I'm an American idol, getting money like Seacrest. 
- [Kelly] Oh, yes! 
- More with Pitbull. How he became an ugly dog, after this. Stay with us. 
- Yee-ooh!

- That's a scene from Ugly Dolls, starring Pitbull. 
- Yeah. 
- You play a character named Ugly Dog. 
- Yeah, you know, the people at the studio really thought this out thoroughly. And, they was like, you know, your name's Pitbull, we want you to play this dog. 
- [Kelly] Right. 
- I was like man, you guys are geniuses. 
- With an alter-ego though. 
- Yeah, but it's great. Well you know, that's why I brought the glasses out today. 'Cause, I'm also Slick Dog. 
- Right. 
- Right. 
- I'm Ugly dog, and Slick Dog, in the movie. What I love about this movie, really, you know, why I signed up for it, it's a perfect time, for the perfect message, to let everybody know, that believe it or not, perfection doesn't exist! 
- Yeah. 
- You know? And... And also, flip the word ugly, which the word ugly is U-Gotta-Love-Yourself. Okay? 
- Aw. 
- Learning a little bit today, huh? 
- Yeah. 
- And, especially in a society where you got all the kids right now on social media, and it's all about followers and likes. When it really should be about leaders and unique. That's what it-
- 
- Yeah. 
- You know, who cares? Forget about following. You know, be yourself. Love yourself. 
- Yeah. 
- And, that's what this movie's all about. You got Uglyville, and Perfectville. And, guess what? Everybody in Uglyville, man, they love each other, they have fun with each other, make fun of each other, they enjoy each other. Everybody in Perfectville, they just, you know, 
- Mhm. 
- Everybody does the same thing, and they all look the same. So, Uglyville... I can't spoil the movie for y'all. You know? 
- I do like the way you, I like the way you were acting it out though. 
- I get loose, I have fun. You know, we get a chance to enjoy, and so it was a lot of fun. Obviously, you see I'm very excited about it. And, they gave me a chance to actually be me in a cartoon character.

- But-
-

- This July 4th... 
- Things are getting strange around here. 
- [Announcer] Next Live, the boys of Stranger Things, house-band O.A.R, and 4th of July games. It's gonna be big. 
- [Kelly] Like, inflatable flamingo big. 
- My body is truly powerful. 
- I have the power to lower my blood-sugar, and A1C. 
- Because, I can still make my own insulin, and Trulicity activates my body to release it. Like, it's supposed to. 
- [Narrator] Trulicity is for people with type 2 diabetes. It's not insulin. 
- [Man] I take it once a week. It starts acting in my body from the first dose. 
- [Narrator] Trulicity isn't for people with type 1 diabetes, or diabetic ketoacidosis. Don't take Trulicity if you're allergic to it, you or your family have medullary thyroid cancer, or have multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2. Stop Trulicity, and call your doctor right away, if you have an allergic reaction, a lump or swelling in your neck, or severe stomach pain. Serious side effects may include pancreatitis. Taking Trulicity with a sulfonylureas, or insulin, increases low blood-sugar risk. Side effects include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, belly pain, and decreased apetite. Which lead to dehydration, and may worsen kidney problems. 
- I have it within me to lower my A1C. 
- [Narrator] Ask your doctor about Trulicity. 
- [Narrator] Ger ready for clearance. It's the Honda 4th of July sales event. Accords on clearance. Civics on clearance. CR-Vs and HR-Vs on clearance. Even the third-row Pilot is on clearance.

- Well, you guys did. You won some Oscar's. 
- Yeah, we got three Oscar's for Black Panther. 
- What a thrill. 
- Yes. 
- I mean, really incredible. And, is the sequel... Are you working on the sequel? Can we talk about that yet? 
- Is that like your smooth pitch to find out 
- No, just trying-
- what's going on? 
- Just trying to figure out if there's a sequel in the works. 
- Yeah, there's a definitely a Black Panther 2. 
- Good. 
- Yeah. 
- In the works. Everything's very hush-hush with Marvel, and Disney. 
- Right. 
- Around it. 
- Yes. 
- You know, if you're eager for a M'Baku fix, I'll be in the... The Avengers Infinity War Part 2. 
- Okay, great. 
- So, that's coming. 
- That's coming as well. 
- That is great. 
- And, we understand as well, you're celebrating all the success, you bought a house? 
- I did, I did. 
- Congratulations, happy home owner. 
- Thank you, so much. Thank you, so much. 
- You know, that's what it is. I thought you looked more burdened than the last time I saw you. 
- I think it's with all the home renovations. That's what it is. You know, finding furniture that fits. 
- Exactly. 
- Yes, yes. Especially 'cause I'm a big guy. So, I'm always trying to make the things work, but you know, 
- Yeah. 
- It's all about size and scale. 
- You want a sumptuous sofa. 
- I like that word. 
- Yes. 
- Sumptuous. 
- Yeah. 
- So, you have to, you actually are shopping for larger than normal couches? 
- I'm not larger than normal, it's just... Things that fit me, but also are in proportion to the home. 
- You know, these chairs seem to fit you well. Maybe you'd like to-
- 
- These work great. 
- These could be great for the dining room. 
- Is this a gift? 
- Yes, absolutely. This is gift. Gelman, we need new chairs. 
- Are you moving anything from your current place, into the new place? 
- Couple things. But, really it's mainly our first family home in the states, you know? 
- So great. 
- So, it's been just a pleasure to be able to do that. Be the first one to purchase-
- 
- Oh, but you have... He has citrus. (stammers) It's her dream to have citrus. 
- My dream is to have a citrus plant of some kind. 
- Yeah. 
- I live in New York City, so that dream is probably never going to happen. Ryan, unbeknownst to me, in all of the years 
- I was keeping it on 
- We've known each other, 
- The DL, like the sequel. 
- Has an orang grove. 
- Oh my God. 
- Okay? He has a secret orange grove. What do you have? 
- In my secret garden. 
- I have kumquats. 
- Oh, no kidding! 
- Kumquats, and I actually-
- 
- The baby orange! 
- You can eat them whole. 
- Yes, I actually, 'cause the skin is sweet, and the inside is sour. 
- Yes. 
- So, they're this like, awesome little fruit. 
- You can make a chutney out of it. 
- Ooh. 
- I will make you some kumquat chutney! 
- Ooh, she said chutney. 
- I will make you a chutney. Can you say it again? Can you say it again? 
- Yeah, chutney. You can make chutney out of your kumquats. Did you know that? 
- Yes, yes. And, I have a little present for you. I brought you some-
- 
- Chutney. 
- My kumquats. 
- No, you didn't! 
- Yeah I did, I did. 
- Are these your kumquats? 
- Yes, these are my kumquats. 
- I am going to chutney this. Oh my gosh. Really? You just popped one right in? 
- Yeah. 
- Really? 
- They're like, satisfying in a poppy way. 
- Yeah, yeah. They're intense. They're very intense. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
- These are fresh. 
- Yeah, they're very fresh. They're from my tree. They're from my tree, 
- I can't believe 
- Winston Zone. 
- You brought-
- We're gonna make you, we're gonna make, manufacture your chutney. M'Baku's chutney. 
- M'Baku's vegetarian chutney. 
- Tell me that... 
- I think that's a glorious idea. 
- That is a trillion dollar idea. 
- Do you... Do you cook? I'm gonna grab my (mumbles). 
- I cook a little bit, but because my size is always going up and down for each role-
- 
- Yeah, I know the feeling. 
- Do you have to do that a lot? 
- A lot, a lot. So, for M'Baku, I had gained about 40 pounds. 
- Right. 
- And then, for upcoming movie Us, 
- Right. 
- Jordan Peele didn't want me to feel like a super hero. So he was like, if you could just eat some burgers, or something. So you could look just like a dad who has responsibilities other than going to the gym. 
- Isn't that amazing? Like, (stammers). And, I think that this is a uniquely male thing, that men in their roles, can go up and down the scale with relative ease. Like, just have a couple of burgers. 
- Yeah, (stammers). That was fun, but then losing the weight is not. 
- Oh, okay. Well, I'm glad to hear you say that. 
- Let's take a break. This is your treat. Just plant those, and have your very own citrus tree. 
- Until the first frost. 
- We'll be right back, and talk about Us, right after this.
