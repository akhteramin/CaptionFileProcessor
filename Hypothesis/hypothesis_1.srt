1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,973
- [Nancy] The hill,

2
00:00:00,973 --> 00:00:04,060
breaking down the
president's message of unity.

3
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:06,500
The picture problem of Governor
Ralph Northam's alma mater.

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,300
- Some are shockingly
racist, some are repugnant.

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,400
- [Nancy] It goes beyond
his infamous photo.

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,320
Tonight, the school's plan to make up

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,240
for it following the apology.

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,640
And cruise ship drug smuggling busted.

9
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,660
- It's when there's
three, 4,000 on a boat,

10
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:20,950
there's a lot of things going on.

11
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,300
- [Nancy] A DC drag queen's plan hatched

12
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,517
on his government computer.

13
00:00:25,517 --> 00:00:28,540
(upbeat, riveting music)

14
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:33,540
- [Announcer] Now, ABC 7
News at 6 On Your Side.

15
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,380
- And right now it's six
o'clock as we come on the air.

16
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,560
We're just three hours away now

17
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,560
from the delayed State
of the Union Address.

18
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,120
- The president uninvited
from delivering it a week ago

19
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,230
after that partial government shutdown.

20
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,000
Chief political correspondent Scott Thuman

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,300
joins us live on the Hill.

22
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,650
And, Scott, what can we
expect to hear tonight?

23
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:53,620
- Well, look, the president's going to try

24
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,440
and sell a message of unity,
of some sort of bipartisanship,

25
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,820
trying to get both sides of the
aisle to agree on something.

26
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,690
He knows that, with Democrats
in power here in the House,

27
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,830
that he has to get some of them on board

28
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,840
if he's going to pass any legislation.

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,230
He also knows the idea

30
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,720
of selling optimism can be very tough,

31
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,703
especially considering
the environment here.

32
00:01:14,703 --> 00:01:16,230
(House applauds)

33
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,100
When President Trump takes
center stage Tuesday night,

34
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,940
he'll call for unity and bipartisanship.

35
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,420
The latest immigration fight
is proof there's been little

36
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,640
to go around lately but no
shortage of finger pointing.

37
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,020
So what can he do?

38
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,270
- He's calling for
bipartisanship and unity,

39
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:35,320
and we're compromising
cooperation and less divisiveness,

40
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,590
retribution politics, as he calls it.

41
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,300
- [Scott] Common ground could be found

42
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,380
over lowering prescription drug costs

43
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,530
or approving shovel-ready projects

44
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,230
for an aging infrastructure.

45
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,673
- Frankly, he made almost
identical statements last year,

46
00:01:47,673 --> 00:01:50,120
and the progress has been painfully small.

47
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,990
- [Scott] He'll have his
work cut out for him.

48
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,640
Skeptical Democrats now
hold power in the House,

49
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,700
and, after enduring a
35-day government shutdown,

50
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,570
the third of his presidency,
he has just 10 days

51
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,370
from a possible fourth.

52
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,900
- He's shown that he's
pretty good at dividing.

53
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,420
I think it's time to demonstrate
he's good at uniting.

54
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,140
- [Scott] From trade to troop movements

55
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,130
to the ultimate controversy, the wall,

56
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,410
healing wounds and
coalescing with Congress

57
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:18,880
could be his greatest challenge
or greatest victory so far.

58
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,830
- I see that in my polling,

59
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,480
I see it as I travel the country.

60
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,960
The do wanna see both
parties work together,

61
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,220
and the president is
extending that olive branch.

62
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,603
We'll see if the Democrats will accept it.

63
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:35,310
- Now I just spoke with a
longtime Democratic congressman,

64
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:38,910
and I asked him is there
anywhere on the left,

65
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,560
are there any members on the left,

66
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,920
that the president can win over tonight?

67
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,000
He said flat out no, that
that is not an option,

68
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,650
that they have written
him off, essentially.

69
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,000
Now, that doesn't mean he couched it,

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,290
that they won't agree on legislation.

71
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,070
If they believe it benefits both of them,

72
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,610
if they believe they're
getting a fair shake,

73
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,670
they said they will work
with the White House.

74
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:00,830
But as far as getting anyone
to really cross the aisle,

75
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,930
that is going to be
very difficult tonight.

76
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,272
Reporting live in Statuary
Hall, I'm Scott Thuman.

77
00:03:05,272 --> 00:03:06,105
Back to you.

78
00:03:06,105 --> 00:03:07,340
- All right, Scott, thank you.

79
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,370
Now keep in mind, some
roads around the Capitol

80
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,660
already closed to pedestrians
at this hour; take a look.

81
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,180
Those are the ones you see
highlighted in red right there.

82
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,820
The ones in purple will close to drivers

83
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,470
in about an hour from now at seven.

84
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,720
Of course, most of the people
attending tonight's speech

85
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,180
will already be at the Capitol
once those roads close,

86
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,010
and that includes the first
person released from prison

87
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,310
as a result of the First
Step Prison Reform bill.

88
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:36,480
Matthew Charles served 35
years for selling crack.

89
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,790
- It's a remarkable experience.

90
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,450
I'm very humbled and grateful.

91
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:43,230
It's something I never could've
fathomed in a million years,

92
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,560
and it's happening, and I'm just thankful.

93
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,920
- [Nancy] The president's
guests also include the father

94
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,450
of one of the sailors killed
in the attack on the USS Cole.

95
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,590
- Now we will bring you the
complete State of the Union

96
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,170
and the Democratic response tonight,

97
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,380
starting at nine o'clock
right here on ABC 7

98
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,700
and our sister station, WJLA 24/7 News.

99
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,870
Then the coverage continues
on ABC 7 News at 11 o'clock.

100
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,130
In other news now, today, an
apology from the president

101
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,390
of the medical school the
Virginia's governor attended

102
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,050
after racist photos surfaced from one

103
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,150
of the school's yearbooks.

104
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,540
- But tonight, despite
intense political pressure,

105
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,360
there is no indication Ralph
Northam plans to step down.

106
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,260
Michelle Marsh begins our team
coverage now from Richmond.

107
00:04:24,938 --> 00:04:27,990
- Nancy and John, in fact,
the protests have died down.

108
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:30,950
On the surface, it appeared
to be business as usual

109
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,160
inside the State House.

110
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,670
We saw lawmakers urgently working to push

111
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:38,140
through legislation on this
all-important crossover day.

112
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,160
We saw the lieutenant
governor, Justin Fairfax,

113
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,300
presiding over the Senate
as he normally does,

114
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,550
this just days after a 2004 allegation

115
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,400
of sexual assault resurfaced against him.

116
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,280
While he admits to a consensual encounter,

117
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,540
he denies he sexually assaulted anyone.

118
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:59,370
Governor Northam, meantime,
still under pressure to resign

119
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,670
after the discovery of
this racist yearbook photo

120
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,223
on his page from 1984.

121
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,220
- I cannot tell you
why he hasn't resigned,

122
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,960
but I am so praying that he would do that

123
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,030
and get it behind us.

124
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:11,970
- [Reporter] So you're still able

125
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,910
to get ahead with the legislative agenda

126
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,560
without any of these controversies
surrounding the governor

127
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,690
nor the lieutenant governor
affecting business?

128
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:19,810
- We have worked on the floor,

129
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,530
we've had debates on legislation,

130
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,667
we've talked about the things that matter,

131
00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:26,003
and we'll continue to move forward.

132
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,410
- Now when it comes to that racist image

133
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,630
that appeared on Northam's yearbook page,

134
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:37,450
the university, Eastern
Virginia Medical School,

135
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,390
takes full responsibility for that.

136
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,240
They came out with that statement today.

137
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,980
Our Tim Barber was there

138
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,073
when the school addressed the issue.

139
00:05:45,073 --> 00:05:47,490
(bright, chiming music)

140
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,680
- We are serious about finding
the facts of what happened.

141
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,090
- [Tim] 40 years after this photo

142
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:55,740
of Governor Northam's 1984
yearboook page resurfaced,

143
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,010
the provost of the governor's alma mater,

144
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,490
Eastern Virginia Medical School,

145
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,290
is launching an investigation in

146
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,200
why photos like this were ever allowed.

147
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,670
- Some are repugnant,
some are unprofessional,

148
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,890
some are shockingly
abhorrent, like I mentioned.

149
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,280
- [Tim] The investigation will be run

150
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,910
by former Virginia Attorney
General Richard Cullen,

151
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,180
who is also representing
the vice president

152
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,940
in Mueller's Russia probe.

153
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,470
Cullen will also look at
other controversial pictures,

154
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:22,120
such as these students in
Confederate uniforms from 2013,

155
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,900
pictures which prompted the provost

156
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,913
to put an end to yearbook production.

157
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,270
Governor Northam first
said he was in the photo

158
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,290
then denied it, then also

demands time to prove his past,

the medical school that
gave the governor his start

163
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,640
is examining its own.

164
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,680
- There are many circumstances
we need to clarify.

165
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,740
That's why we hired the independent
law firm to investigate.

166
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,330
- [Tim] Reporting in Norfolk, Virginia,

Tim Barber, ABC 7 News.

168
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,710
- Now while the governor may be trying

169
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,160
to win over those who
want him out of office

170
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,350
through time and regaining their trust,

171

we spoke to one lawmaker
today, Senator Lucas,

172
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,250
who says he needs to resign now.

173
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,730

that we've been following
for over the last few hours.

186
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,399
It was a possible
transformer that exploded

187
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,370
and rattled a lot of nerves
in downtown Arlington.

188
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,940
It happened at North
Lynn and 19th Streets,

189
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,940
right in the heart of
Rosslyn leading right

up to Key Bridge, which is a major artery,

191

especially this time of day.

192
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,570
Now nobody was hurt,
but the fire department

193
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,520
did rescue people that were
trapped in some elevators

194
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,870
while the power was out.

195

and it may not be the only one this week.

210

Thursday at 11.

222
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:55,870
- I didn't realize how bad my smile was

223
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,400
with fillings and root canals.

224
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,720
I had to do something.

225
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,470
I looked at partial bridges,
I looked at dentures.

226
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,840
Out of all the options,

227
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,680
Clear Choice was the only choice for me.

228

He wasn't putting bad foods in his body.

He's like, man, if you want longevity,

255
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,760

- [Nancy] Tonight, 10 people dead

277
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,810
after this massive fire tore

278
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:14,080
through an apartment complex in Paris.

279
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,410
Some residents there
are climbing to the roof

280
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:20,130
of this nine-story building
just to try and escape.

281
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,060
A 40-year-old woman who
lived in that building

282
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,230
under arrest tonight.

283
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:26,840
Police say she has a
history of mental problems.

284
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,280
- [John] We're also getting
new information tonight

285
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,620
after that deadly plane
crash in California.

286
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,730
Police say the pilot may not have been

287
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,150
who he claimed to be.

288
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:36,130
Initial reports were that the 75 year old

289
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:39,380
was a retired police officer
from Chicago living in Nevada.

290
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,090
Today, though, the Chicago
Police Department came out

291
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,700
and said there's no record that he

292
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,710
was ever with their force.

293
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,100
Police are still trying to figure out

294
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,980
why that twin engine plane broke apart

295
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,920
over a Southern California neighborhood,

296
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,740
killing the pilot and four people

297
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,324
in a home celebrating the Super Bowl.

298
00:11:53,324 --> 00:11:54,630
(bright, chiming music)

299
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,450
And only on 7, two men accused

300
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,980
of stealing half a million dollars

301
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,460
in copper from a Montgomery
County construction site.

302
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,870
The pipes and wiring
were taken in White Oak,

303
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:06,470
where the new Washington
Adventist Hospital will be built.

304
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:09,010
Police say that the men broke
into a fenced-off work area

305
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:12,070
10 times over a nine-month period.

306
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:14,100
They were caught after
police connected them

307
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,810
to the crime scene using
the GPS information

308
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,410
from their cell phones.

309
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:22,080
- Coming up at six...

- [John] And less than 24 hours
