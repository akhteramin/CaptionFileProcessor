WE DON'T HAVE TO SHOW THAT TYPE OF DISPLAY OF FORCE BECAUSE THE WORLD ALREADY KNOWS IT
AND WHAT I FOUND SO DISAPPOINTING WHEN IT CAME TO JULY 4th IS JULY 4th IS TO COMMEMORATE OUR ROOTS AS AMERICANS,
THE FACT THAT WE FLED DIFFERENT COUNTRIES HERE, AND RECOGNIZE THAT,
OUR DNA IS WE'RE A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS AND WE HAVE STRENGTH AND DON'T HAVE TO SHOW MILITARY MIGHT BECAUSE THE WORLD KNOWS IT,
