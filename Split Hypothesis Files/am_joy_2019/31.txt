THERE WAS AN PIECE TO THE "WASHINGTON POST,"
THE ARCHITECTURE IS ABOUT RECONCILIATION,
IT'S ABOUT THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL, OUR ORIGINAL SIN WAS SLAVERY. THE CIVIL WAR, AND THIS IS WHERE WE WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE RECONCILIATION, AND INSTEAD TODAY WE HAVE IMAGES OF TANKS AND THE WHOLE CRISIS AT THE BORDER.
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU THE LAST WORD, CONGRESSMAN.
