DONALD TRUMP FINALLY GOT HIS SPECIAL DONALD TRUMP PARADE,
ROLLING TANKS DOWN THE STREETS OF YOUR CAPITAL, FLYING AIR FORCE PLANES OVER HIS HEAD WHILE HE GAVE AN ODD SPEECH ABOUT THE AIRPORTS, THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS TOOK CONTROL OF DURING THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR?
IN JUNE OF 1775, THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS CREATED A UNIFIED ARMY OUT OF THE REVOLUTIONARY FORCES ENCAMPED AROUND BOSTON AND NEW YORK. AND NAMED AFTER THE GREAT GEORGE WASHINGTON COMMANDER IN CHIEF.
THE CONTINENTAL ARMY SUFFERED A BITTER WINTER OF VALLEY FORGE, FOUND GLORY ACROSS THE WATERS OF THE DELAWARE, AND SEIZED VICTORY FROM CORN WALLACE OF YORK TOWN.
