IT'S AN INTERESTING PARADOX HERE, WHICH IS THAT SEVERAL YEARS AGO, I DID A FULL BRIGHT FELLOWSHIP AND SPENT AN ENTIRE SEMESTER IN MOSCOW, TEACHING AT MOSCOW STATE UNIVERSITY AND AT THE END OF THE SEMESTER, THERE WAS THE MAY 9th CELEBRATION.
ANYBODY WHO HAS BEEN TO RUSSIA OR KNOWS, YOU KNOW, ABOUT THEIR HISTORY POST WORLD WAR II, MAY 9th IS A GIGANTIC CELEBRATION THAT HAPPENS EACH YEAR SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE FOURTH OF JULY AND NEW YEAR'S AND IT IS A RECOGNITION OF THE SOVIET DEFEAT NAZI THREAT, AN THREAT IN WORLD WAR II.
