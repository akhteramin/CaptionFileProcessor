IT'S HUGE. I WAS THERE FOR THE PARADE AND THERE'S THIS COMPLETE PROCESSION OF MILITARY VEHICLES.
THEIR MISSILES, TANKS, ARMORED VEHICLES, THEIR JEEPS AND IT LOOKS LIKE AN ARMY AMASSING FOR AN INVASION.
SOMEONE TURNS TO ME AND SAYS DO YOU DO THE SAME THING IN THE UNITED STATES ON THE FOURTH OF JULY.
I SAID, NO, THIS WOULD NEVER HAPPEN IN THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE THEY, IN THE UNITED STATES BELIEVER THERE SHOULD BE A REALLY CLEAR DISTINCTION BETWEEN CIVILIAN AUTHORITY AND MILITARY MIGHT AND THAT OUR AUTHORITY IS SUPPOSED TO, AT LEAST IN THEORY, STEM FROM OUR LAWS AND OUR MORAL BELIEVES.
