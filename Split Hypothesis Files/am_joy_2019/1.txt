"A.M. JOY", LIVE FROM NEW ORLEANS. WELL, THIS WEEK ON AMERICA'S BIRTHDAY, KNOWN AS INDEPENDENCE DAY OR SIMPLY JULY 4, DONALD TRUMP THREW HIMSELF A PARTY.
EVER SINCE HE SAW THAT THE FRENCH PRESIDENT HAS A PARADE, IT'S CALLED BASTILLE DAY AND THE DICTATOR OF NORTH KOREA HAS A PARADE, IT'S CALLED AUTHORITARIANISM, AND THAT THEY GET TO HAVE TANKS AND PEOPLE MARCHING IN FRONT OF THEM AND SALUTING THEM, AND ALL OF THAT STUFF, HE'S WANTED TO HAVE ONE TOO.
HE TRIED TO CO-OP OTHER HOLIDAYS LIKE VETERANS DAY AND MEMORIAL DAY, BUT THE ADULTS IN THE MILITARY KEPT PUSHING HIM BACK.
NO MORE.
