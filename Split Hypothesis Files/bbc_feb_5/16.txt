IT DOESN'T HAPPEN IN A VACUUM. WE CANNOT LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAYS TONIGHT WITHOUT REGARD TO WHAT HE SAID YESTERDAY AND WHAT HE WILL SAY TOMORROW.
IF THE PRESIDENT CONTINUES TO STIGMATIZE IMMIGRANTS AND SPURN ALLIES, HOW IS THAT UNITY?
IF THE WHITE HOUSE GOES TO SUCH EXTREMES TO MAKE THAT CASE THAT THIS IS A CASE ABOUT UNITY, IF HE DOES THAT ONE DAY A YEAR USING SENTENCES THAT WE KNOW DON'T SOUND THE WAY PRESIDENT TRUMP AS WE ALL KNOW SOUNDS, IT GIVES LIE TO THE WHOLE CHARADE.
LAURA: BUT AS A FORMER SPEECHWRITER, HOW MUCH WORK WOULD GO INTO A SPEECH LIKE THIS?
