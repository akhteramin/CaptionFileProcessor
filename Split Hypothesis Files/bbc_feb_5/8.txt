KATTY: I THINK IT IS.
THERE ARE AREAS WHERE THE PRESIDENT AND THE REPUBLICANS DEMOCRATS DO AGREE.
THEY COULD DO A BIG DEAL ON INFRASTRUCTURE. I SUSPECT WE WILL HEAR THE PRESIDENT REACH OUT TO DEMOCRATS ON AN ISSUE LIKE THAT.
THE TROUBLE IS THERE IS SO LITTLE TRUST ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE OF THIS PRESIDENT THAT ARE THEY WILLING TO GIVE HIM SOME KIND OF DEAL THAT HE CAN TAKE HOME AND SAY, LOOK, I'VE MANAGED TO ACHIEVE SOMETHING?
