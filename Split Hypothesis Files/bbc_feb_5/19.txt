IT IS THE PRESIDENT COMING TO THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE AT THE INVITATION OF THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE, WHICH UNDERSCORES THAT OUR DEMOCRACY IS ABOUT CHECKS AND BALANCES, AND THE PRESIDENT WHETHER HE LIKES IT OR NOT NEEDS CONGRESS TO PASS HIS AGENDA.
LAURA: ALTHOUGH WE HEAR FROM THE PRESIDENT, ESPECIALLY THIS ONE, IN A VARIETY OF WAYS ON TWITTER AND IMPROMPTU PRESS CONFERENCES, AS AN OCCASION DO YOU THINK THE STATE OF THE UNION RETAINS ITS POWER?
STEPHEN: I THINK IT RETAINS ITS POWER IN A GENERAL SENSE BECAUSE OF THE PRESIDENT SPEAKING TO ALL GOVERNMENT ASSEMBLED, AS WELL AS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BEYOND AND AROUND THE WORLD.
IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE, I THINK IT DOES HIM A DISSERVICE.
