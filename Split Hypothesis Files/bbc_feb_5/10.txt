YOU ARE RIGHT, THE 2020 REELECTION CAMPAIGN IS ALL OVER THIS STATE OF THE NOON ADDRESS.
LAURA: WHAT WILL YOU BE WATCHING FOR WHEN YOU SEE NANCY PELOSI THERE, THE SYMBOL OF DIVIDED GOVERNMENT WATCHING OVER THE PRESIDENT?
KATTY: IT IS ALMOST A VISUAL REMINDER IN EVERY SHOT, BECAUSE IN THESE STATES OF THE UNIONS, YOU HAVE THE PRESIDENT AND THEN THE TWO PEOPLE, MIKE PENCE AND NANCY PELOSI BEHIND HIM. THEY ARE IN ALMOST EVERY SHOT.
IT IS ALMOST A VISUAL REMINDER OF THIS NEW, TOUGHER POLITICAL LANDSCAPE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP FACES.
