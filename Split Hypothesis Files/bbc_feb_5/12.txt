IT IS ALL THOSE NEWLY ELECTED MEMBERS OF THE DEMOCRATIC HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES SITTING IN FRONT OF HIM.
THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT STATE OF THE UNION AUDIENCE IN THAT CHAMBER THAN IT WAS FOR HIM A YEAR AGO.
LAURA: KATTY KAY, THANK YOU.
THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS IS A MARQUEE EVENT, A SPEECH WHICH IS REWRITTEN MULTIPLE TIMES.
