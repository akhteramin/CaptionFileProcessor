PRESIDENT TRUMP KNOWS HE WILL NOT GET A TELEVISION AUDIENCE THIS BIG AGAIN UNTIL THE 2020 REELECTION CAMPAIGN IS WELL UNDERWAY. AND SO HE HAS GOT THAT POLITICAL TIMETABLE IN MIND.
JUGGLING THOSE TWO THINGS IS GOING TO BE TRICKY IN TERMS OF TONE, AND WE KNOW WHAT IS SAID IN A SPEECH TONIGHT ON CAPITOL HILL COULD VERY QUICKLY BE OVERTURNED WITH ONE TWEET TOMORROW MORNING.
LAURA: IT CAN INDEED.
IS THIS LAYING OUT THE BATTLE LINES FOR THE 2020 ELECTION?
