BUT PRESIDENT TRUMP ADDING OVERNIGHT, THE FIREWORKS HAVE BEEN DONATED AND THE COST WILL BE VERY LITTLE COMPARED TO WHAT IT IS WORTH. THE $750,000 OF TARIFFS WERE DONATED BY AN OHIO COMPANY THAT LOBBIED THE PRESIDENT LAST MONTH TO HOLD OFF ON THE TARIFFS FOR CHINA.
 THE PRESIDENT KNOWS HE WOULD DO SO THE SAME DAY HE ANNOUNCED THE DONATION.
