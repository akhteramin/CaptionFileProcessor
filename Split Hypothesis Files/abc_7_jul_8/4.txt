 HERE IS OUR FUTURECAST HERE IS THE HIGH-RESOLUTION MODEL AND WILL STOP AT 2:00. LOOK AT HOW QUICKLY THE MODEL HAS THOSE STORMS POPPING UP.
 THEY DO NOT MOVE VERY FAST AND THEY COULD BRING HEAVY RAIN TO THE DISTRICT IN ARLINGTON AND ALEXANDRIA AT 4:00 P.M. AND CONTINUE AS WE MOVE INTO THE ALL IMPORTANT 6:00 AND 7:00 HOUR.
 IF THERE IS ANY GOOD NEWS. BY 8:00 TONIGHT SHOWERS BECOME MORE LIMITED AND THE FIREWORKS DISPLAY SET TO BEGIN AT 7:00 P.M. IT SHOULD GON. AT LEAST, ACCORDING TO THIS MODEL HERE. ALTHOUGH THE CLOUD DECK MAYBE A LITTLE ON THE LOW SIDE 
 WORTH WATCHING AND WE WILL KEEP YOU UPDATED
