THE BEST FIGHTER JETS IN THE WORLD AND OTHER PLANES,
THE EVENT IS SETTING OF MORE THAN PYROTECHNIC DEVICES
BUT IT IS ALSO SPARKING BACKLASH FROM CRITICS WHO ACCUSE THE PRESIDENT OF STAGING GLORIFIED CAMPAIGN RALLY AND TURNING THE CELEBRATION INTO A PARTISAN EVENT.
 THE EVENT IS FREE BUT THE WHITE HOUSE HAS GIVEN VIP TICKETS TO THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE AND TOP DONORS
