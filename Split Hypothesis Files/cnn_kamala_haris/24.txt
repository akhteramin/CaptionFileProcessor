DO YOU SUPPORT INITIATIVES SUCH AS FREE COLLEGE, LOAN PROTECTIVE LEGISLATION, OR STUDENT REPAYMENT PLANS?
YEAH, ANGELA. KNOW, LISTEN, THE STUDENTS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE ARE AMONG THE TOP FIVE IN THE COUNTRY WITH STUDENT LOAN DEBT.
AND IT IS ABSOLUTELY UNCONSCIONABLE THAT WE HAVE STUDENTS IN AMERICA WHO ARE IN ABSOLUTE FEAR ABOUT THE DEBT THAT THEY WILL OWE UPON GRADUATION.
AND I HAVE MET AND KNOW SO MANY STUDENTS WHO ARE MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR CAREER BASED ON THEIR FEAR THAT THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PAY THEIR BILLS.
