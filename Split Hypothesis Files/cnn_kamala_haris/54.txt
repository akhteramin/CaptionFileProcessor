WHY DO YOU SUPPORT IT?
I SUPPORT IT BECAUSE I, TO MY CORE, KNOW THAT THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS REPRESENTING AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO WHO WE ARE AS HUMAN BEINGS,
WE HAVE SUPPOSED LEADERS PUSHING SCIENCE FICTION INSTEAD OF SCIENCE FACT
AND THIS IS TO OUR COLLECTIVE PERIL IF WE DON'T TAKE THIS MATTER SERIOUSLY WITH A SENSE OF YOU ARE URGENCY.
