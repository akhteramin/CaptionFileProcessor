AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THE IMPEACHMENT PROCESS
THERE WILL BE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE HOUSE AND AN INVESTIGATION THAT TAKES PLACE.
I THINK WE CAN BE PRETTY SURE IT LOOKS LIKE THAT IS VERY LIKELY TO HAPPEN
AND THEN IT'S GOING TO GO OVER TO THE SENATE. AND THE HOUSE NEEDS TO BE A VOTE BY A MAJORITY, A SIMPLE MAJORITY
