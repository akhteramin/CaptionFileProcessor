IF YOU TOOK OUT STUDENT LOANS BETWEEN 2006 AND 2013, THE INTEREST RATE WAS ABOUT 7%.
WHAT I AM PROPOSING IS REGARDLESS OF THE INTEREST RATE AT THE TIME THAT YOU TOOK OUT OUR STUDENT LOANS, THAT UPON REPAYMENT IT WOULD HAVE TO BE AT
THE OTHER THING IS THIS. PART OF THE ISSUE IS THAT TERMS OF REPAYMENT
THERE IS NO CONNECTION BETWEEN WHAT YOU OWE AND YOUR INCOME.
