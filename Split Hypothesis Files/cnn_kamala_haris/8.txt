I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO GET RID OF THIS PRESIDENT. THAT'S WHY I'M RUNNING TO BECOME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
THAT IS PART OF THE PREMISE, OBVIOUSLY, OF MY PLAN.
BUT I THINK WE ARE VERY GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS AN INVESTIGATION THAT HAS BEEN CONDUCTED WHICH HAS PRODUCED EVIDENCE THAT TELLS US THAT THIS PRESIDENT AND HIS ADMINISTRATION ENGAGED IN OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.
I BELIEVE CONGRESS SHOULD TAKE THE STEPS TOWARDS IMPEACHMENT.
