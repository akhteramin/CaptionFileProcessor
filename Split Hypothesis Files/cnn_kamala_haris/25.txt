I KNOW SO MANY STUDENTS WHO HAVE GRADUATED WHO ARE MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TO HAVE A FAMILY
BASED ON THE BURDEN OF THEIR STUDENT LOAN DEBT AND BEING CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH THE MONTH.
WE CANNOT AFFORD TO HAVE A SYSTEM LIKE THIS, ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE MADE AN INVESTMENT OF THEIR TIME AND THEIR RESOURCES
BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY WANT AN EDUCATION TO LIVE A PRODUCTIVE LIFE AND CONTRIBUTE TO OUR SOCIETY AND BE LEADERS.
