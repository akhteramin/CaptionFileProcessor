BUT WE NEED REASONABLE GUN SAFETY LAWS IN THIS COUNTRY, STARTING WITH UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS AND A RENEWAL OF THE ASSAULT WEAPON BAN
BUT THEY HAVE FAILED TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO ACT. BEN HERE IS MY RESPONSE TO YOU.
UPON BEING ELECTED I WILL GIVE THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS 100 DAYS TO GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER AND HAVE THE COURAGE TO PASS REASONABLE GUN SAFETY LAWS.
AND IF THEY FAIL TO DO IT, THEN I WILL TAKE EXECUTIVE ACTION. AND SPECIFICALLY WHAT I WILL DO IS PUT IN PLACE A REQUIREMENT THAT FOR ANYONE WHO SELLS MORE THAN FIVE GUNS A YEAR THEY ARE REQUIRED TO DO BACKGROUND CHECKS WHEN THEY SELL THOSE GUNS.
