SIR REMARKS IT'S INCREDIBLE TO WATCH THESE GUYS DO THEIR WORK, FILLING UP TRUCK AFTER TRUCK WITH SALT AND SAND.
THEY ARE READING OUT TO INTERSTATES FROM SALT DOME IN FAIRFAX AND ASKING FOR HELP FROM THE PUBLIC TOMORROW WHEN ALL THIS WET STUFF STARTS COMING DOWN.
IF EVERYBODY STAYS HOME, HANGOUT, WATCH CHANNEL FIVE, IT WOULD BE GREAT FOR US.
STAY HOME. STAY HOME. IT'S GONNA BE PRETTY NASTY STAY HOME.
