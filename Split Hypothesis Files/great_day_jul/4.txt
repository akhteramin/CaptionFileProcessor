AND MONTGOMERY SEEING SOME HEAVY RAIN. MERI AND I WERE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE PRESIP INTENSITY IN THE FIVE PLUS INCHES PER HOUR SO THESE ARE TROPICAL DOWNPOURS CAUSING SOME FLASH FLOODING,
BUT A NUMBER OF WATER RESCUES IN FREDERICK AND MONTGOMERY COUNTY.
I-66 SOUTH SEEMS TO BE THE HEAVIEST.
YOU'RE STARTING TO SEE HEAVY RAIN MOVE IN AND EVERYWHERE ORANGE AND RED, VERY, VERY HEAVY RAINFALL FROM FedEx FIELD ACROSS THE HEART OF D.C.
