MOVING TOWARDS THE HEART OF ALEXANDRIA.
OUR FRIENDS IN MT. VERNON, AND PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY,
GENERALLY SOUTH OF JOINT BASE ANDREWS, GET READY AS THIS WHOLE MASS OF WATER IS MOVING TOWARDS YOU WITH THE FLASH FLOOD WARNING UNTIL 11:15, AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE BETTER WEATHER.
ONCE WE GET RID OF THE STUFF THIS MORNING WE'LL SEE THE ACTIVITY SHIFT OFF TO THE SOUTH AND WEST AS WE GET INTO THE AFTERNOON.
