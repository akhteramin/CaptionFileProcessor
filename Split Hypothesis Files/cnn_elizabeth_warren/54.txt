THERE WAS A VERY POPULAR REPUBLICAN INCUMBENT.
HE HAD HIGH APPROVAL RATINGS, HE HAD A BUCKET OF MONEY IN THE BANK FROM WALL STREET AND HE HAD JUST BEATEN A WOMAN WHO WAS REALLY GOOD AND EVERYBODY THOUGHT WAS GOING TO WIN.
SO I START GETTING THESE PHONE CALLS FROM PEOPLE AND THEY SAY, ELIZABETH, YOU SHOULD RUN AGAINST HIM FOR THE SENATE SEAT.
YOU SHOULD DO IT.
