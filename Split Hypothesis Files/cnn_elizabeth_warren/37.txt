IT MAKES NO DARN SENSE THAT RIGHT NOW IN AMERICA WE TREAT MARIJUANA AS A SCHEDULE 1 DRUG, WHICH MEANS IN EFFECT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS DETERMINED IN ADVANCE THAT IT HAS NO MEDICINAL USE, THAT IT CAN'T HAVE ANY GOOD EFFECTS, NO RESEARCH IS SUPPOSED TO BE DONE.
IT MAKES IT VERY HARD TO DO RESEARCH ON IT
AND THAT'S JUST -WE SHOULD BE DOING THIS, RIGHT?
WE SHOULD BE LOOKING INTO IT.
