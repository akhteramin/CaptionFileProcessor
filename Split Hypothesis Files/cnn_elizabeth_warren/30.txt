LOOK, HERE'S HOW I SEE IT.
YOU CAN RUN THE PLATFORM, THAT IS, YOU CAN BE THE UMPIRE IN THE BASEBALL GAME AND YOU CAN RUN AN HONEST PLATFORM, OR YOU CAN BE A PLAYER, THAT IS, YOU CAN HAVE A BUSINESS OR YOU CAN HAVE A TEAM IN THE GAME, BUT YOU DON'T GET TO BE THE UMPIRE AND HAVE A TEAM IN THE GAME.
IF WE BREAK OFF THE PLATFORM FROM THE PARTS THAT ARE COMPETING, WHAT YOU'LL SEE IN AMERICA IS A PLATFORM THAT WORKS REALLY WELL.
IT'S A VERY PROFITABLE BUSINESS BUT YOU'LL SEE A LOT MORE COMPETITION WHERE LITTLE BUSINESSES HAVE A CHANCE TO GET GOING WHERE WHEN YOU'VE GOT A GOOD IDEA YOU CAN BUILD THAT INTO SOMETHING, WHERE THERE'S REALLY A CHANCE FOR EVERYBODY TO GET IN AND COMPETE.
