IF WE ASK THE GREAT FORTUNES IN THIS COUNTRY, UNDERSTAND, THIS ISN'T ABOUT TRYING TO BE NASTY OR SAY YOU'VE DONE ANYTHING WRONG, WHAT IT'S ABOUT IS SAYING, LOOK, YOU HAD A GREAT IDEA.
YOU GOT OUT THERE.
YOU WORKED HARD OR YOU INHERITED WELL. WHICHEVER ONE IT WAS.
[ APPLAUSE ] BUT NOW THAT YOU'VE GOT THAT GREAT FORTUNE, SPEND JUST A MINUTE TO REMEMBER HOW YOU GOT IT.
