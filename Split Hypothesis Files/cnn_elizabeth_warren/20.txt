YOU'VE GOT TO PAY SOMETHING BACK SO EVERYBODY ELSE GETS A CHANCE.
AND HERE'S HOW THE MONEY WORKS OUT.
IF WE PUT THAT TWO CENT WEALTH TAX IN PLACE ON THE 75,000 LARGEST FORTUNES IN THIS COUNTRY, TWO CENTS, WE CAN DO UNIVERSAL CHILD CARE FOR EVERY BABY ZERO TO 5, UNIVERSAL PRE-K, UNIVERSAL COLLEGE AND KNOCK BACK THE STUDENT LOAN DEBT BURDEN FOR 95% OF OUR STUDENTS AND STILL HAVE NEARLY A TRILLION DOLLARS LEFT OVER.
[ APPLAUSE ] YEAH.
