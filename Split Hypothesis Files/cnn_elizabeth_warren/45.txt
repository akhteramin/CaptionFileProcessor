[ APPLAUSE ] SFFOURTH IS THAT WHEN PEOPLE LEAVE THE PRISON SYSTEM, THEY NEED TO BE REINTEGRATED.
THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO FIND A JOB, FIND DECENT HOUSING,, AND THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS.
AND THAT MEANS THEY NEED THE RIGHT TO VOTE TO BE REINSTATED.
THEY ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS.
