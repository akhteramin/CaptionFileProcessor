STUDY AFTER STUDY AFTER STUDY SHOWS US THAT AFRICAN-AMERICANS COMPARED WITH WHITES ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE FOR EXACTLY THE SAME CRIMES, THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO BE ARRESTED, THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO BE ARRAIGNED, THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE TAKEN TO TRIAL.
THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE WRONGFULLY CONVICTED AND THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO RECEIVE HARSHER SENTENCES.
THIS IS A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT IS NOT ONLY LOCKING UP TOO MANY PEOPLE, IT IS A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT HAS A PROBLEM OF RACE RIGHT AT THE HEART OF IT, AND WE NEED TO CALL IT OUT FOR WHAT IT IS.
[ APPLAUSE ] NO ONE IS SAFER IN A WORLD WHERE WE HAVE A BROKEN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,
