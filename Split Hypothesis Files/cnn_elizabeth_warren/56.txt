YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE.
ALL I CAN SAY IS DEMOCRATS, GET A BETTER MESSAGE.
BUT PEOPLE SAID TO ME, YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE BECAUSE MASSACHUSETTS IN 2011, ACCORDING TO CONVENTIONAL WISDOM, WAS NOT READY TO HAVE A WOMAN SENATOR OR GOVERNOR.
WE NEVER HAD AND PEOPLE SAID IT'S JUST NOT GOING TO HAPPEN, GENERATION.
