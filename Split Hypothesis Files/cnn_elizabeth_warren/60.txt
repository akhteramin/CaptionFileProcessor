AND SO EVERY NIGHT WHEN I WENT HOME, NO MATTER WHAT THE DAY HAD BEEN LIKE, I WOULD COUNT UP HOW MANY PINKY SWEARS WE HAD DONE DURING THE DAY.
AND I KEPT GETTING OUT THERE AND HAMMERING MY MESSAGE.
I KEPT GETTING OUT THERE TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH WORKING FAMILIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY, TALKING ABOUT HOW WASHINGTON WORKS GREAT FOR THE RICH AND THE POWERFUL, JUST NOT WORKING FOR ANYONE ELSE, AND HOW WE'VE GOT TO FIGHT BACK AGAINST THAT.
SO I TALKED ABOUT IT EVERY SINGLE DAY AND ULTIMATELY I WENT FROM 17 POINTS BEHIND THAT GUY TO BEATING HIM BY 7 1/2.
