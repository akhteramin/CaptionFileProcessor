BUT THE SECOND REASON IS BECAUSE OF THE RACIAL IMPACT OF THE ENFORCEMENT OF MARIJUANA LAWS.
YOU KNOW, RIGHT NOW IN THIS COUNTRY THE BEST EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND WHITES USE MARIJUANA AT ABOUT THE SAME RATES AND YET AFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO BE ARRESTED FOR MARIJUANA USE THAN WHITES ARE.
SO EVERY TIME WE START TO TALK ABOUT CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM, FOR EXAMPLE, I THINK A GOOD PLACE TO START IS WITH THE THINGS WE MAKE ILLEGAL, AND ONE OF THE BEST PLACES WE COULD START IS BY LEGALIZING MARIJUANA.
I WANT YOU TO MEET JACKSON DWYER, HE'S FROM MASSACHUSETTS.
