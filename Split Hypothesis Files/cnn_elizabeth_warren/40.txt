HOW CAN YOU ASSURE ME THAT YOU WILL SUPPORT LEGISLATION THAT KEEPS LAW ENFORCEMENT SAFE?
SO THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION.
I APPRECIATE YOUR ASKING IT.
YOU KNOW, I TALK WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, PEOPLE WHO ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT, PEOPLE IN THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM, PEOPLE WHO ARE IN -PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED, VARIOUS PARTS OF IT, AND WHAT ALL OF THEM TELL ME IS WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM.
