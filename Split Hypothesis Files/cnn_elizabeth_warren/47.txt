I WROTE AN OP ED WITH HIS PARENTS ABOUT ASKING FOR OUR LEADERS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY TO STEP UP AND PASS SOME SENSIBLE GUN SAFETY LAWS.
WE NEED UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS,
WE NEED TO TAKE WEAPONS OF WAR OFF OUR CITY STREETS.
RIGHT NOW WE LIVE IN AMERICA WHERE 7 CHILDREN AND TEENAGERS WILL DIE EVERY SINGLE DAY, WHERE THE LIVES OF OFFICERS ARE PUT AT RISK.
