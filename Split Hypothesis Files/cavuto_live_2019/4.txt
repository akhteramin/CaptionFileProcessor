YOU COULD REALLC IN PEOPLE'S VOICES.
THIS WAS A RESTAURANT RIGHT HERE IN RIDGECREST AND T WAS A SLIGHT AFTERSHOCK BEFORE THIS AND EVERY ONE, THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH A FEW IN THE LAST DAY 
BUT THE 7.1 THE WHOLE BUILDING WAS SHAKING, DISHES CRASHING ON THE GROUND AND YOU COULD SEE PEOPLE IN DISBELIEF, SOME HITTING THE GROUND IN TEARS 
AND SHORTLY AFTER WALKING OUT OF THIS RESTAURANT WE LOOKED INTO THE DISTANCE AND WE SEE A HUGE PLUME OF SMOKE,
