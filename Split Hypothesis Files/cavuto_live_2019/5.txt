WE GET CLOSER AND REALIZE THIS HOUSE IS ON FIRE AND THIS IS AT LEAST ONE HOUSE THAT WAS SET ON FIRE, 
A LOT OF THESE FRTED BECAUSE OF RUPTURED GAS LINES.
WE ARE ONLY HEARING OF SOME MINOR INJURIES, AND THINGS FALLING ON PEOPLE, REPORTS OF ANY DEPTH BUT THE GOVERNOR HAS DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY, HAS REQUESTED A PRESIDENTIAL DECLARATION, HELP FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
SO FAR THE PRESIDENT HASN'T TWEETED ABOUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN CALIFORNIA.
