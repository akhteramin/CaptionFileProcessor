WE CAUGHT UP WITH THE SHERIFF'S DEPUTY GOING STREET TO STREET TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE WERE OKAY.
HE SAW A LOT OF PEOPLE LIVING OUTSIDE OR COMING HERE TO CITY HALL WHERE THERE IS A SHELTER SET UP.
MAYBE WE COULD PULL UP THE ACTUAL SOUND ON THIS. THIS IS THE MOMENT WE WERE AT A RESTAURANT, 
STARTED TO FEEL THE RUMBLING, THE VIOLENT SHAKING AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT. TAKE A LISTEN.
