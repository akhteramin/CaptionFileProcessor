BUT IN A SHOCKING TWIST, SCOTT TESTIFIED THAT HE, NOT GALLAGHER, KILLED THE BETTEEN BY PLUGGING HIS AIRWAY TO PREVENT HIM FROM BEING TORTURED BY IRAQI FORCES, SAYING, "I KNEW HE WAS GOING TO DIE ANYWAY."
GALLAGHER'S DEFENSE TEAM ARGUED DURING THE TWO-WEEK TRIAL THAT THE CASE WAS BUILT ON FALSE ACCUSATIONS FROM DISGRUNTLED SAILORS.
THIS IS NOT A MURDER, THIS IS A MUTINY.
THIS IS A GROUP OF YOUNG DISGRUNTLED SAILORS THAT DIDN'T LIKE BEING TOLD THAT THEY WERE COWARDS.
