In February 1992, Kurt married the former stripper and lead singer of the band Hole, Courtney Love.'
As soon as she married him, I listened to a lot of his poetry and a lot of his music and I thought, "This guy's pretty profound."
(BEV) I think he was popular because he was wounded.
He looked like a person who was down on his luck and rebellious.
