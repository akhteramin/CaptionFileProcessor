KATIE HOLMES AND JAMIE FOXX MADE A PUBLIC DEBUT AS A COUPLE LAST NIGHT 
WHILE THEY DIDN'T HIT THE PINK CARPET TOGETHER, THE COUPLE DID POSE FOR PHOTOS WITH ONE ANOTHER INSIDE AND KENDALL AND KYLIE JENNER BROKE OUT THE FEATHERS, 
TETHER WORE A BRIGHT ORANGE FOR SUCH A DOWN, WHILE KYLIE WENT FOR A MATCHING WIG.
JANEL MONET EMBRACED WEARABLE ART WITH THIS CUSTOM LOOK, AND EVEN WINKED AS SHE CUT DOWN THE CARPET.
