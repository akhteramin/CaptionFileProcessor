CARDY B WON THE AWARD FOR THIS GOWN, 
THE 10 FOOT LONG TRAIN IT NEARLY TOOK OVER THE PINK CARPET. SIERRA MIGHT HAVE ONE BEST TEAR OF THE NIGHT, I THINK SHE ONE LET'S BE HONEST WITH THIS VERY EXTRA GORGEOUS AFRO, 
SHE ALSO WORE A CUSTOM EMERALD GREEN CROWN BECAUSE SHE IS A QUEEN AND SUNDAY I HAD A FAIRLY -- FAIRYTALE MOMENT TRANSFORMING INTO CINDERELLA IN THIS TOMMY HILFIGER BALLGOWN WITH A SKIRT THAT LIT UP. YES YES YES.
