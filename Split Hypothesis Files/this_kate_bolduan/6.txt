WE'RE HEARING FROM ACTING DHS SECRETARY ABOUT THOSE SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS.
REMEMBER EARLIER THIS WEEK, KATE, WE REPORTED ABOUT THIS CLOSED FACEBOOK GROUP THAT FEATURED CURRENT AND FORMER, THEY SAY, BORDER PATROL AGENTS MAKING LEWD COMMENTS, DEROGATORY COMMENTS, RACIALLY INFLAMMATORY COMMENTS, JOKING ABOUT DEAD MIGRANTS.
NOW THE ACTING DHS SECRETARY TWEETING THIS, THIS MORNING.
I HAVE DIRECTED AN IMMEDIATE INVESTIGATION AND AS THE U.S. BORDER PATROL CHIEF HAS MADE CLEAR, ANY EMPLOYEE FOUND TO HAVE COMPROMISED THE PUBLIC'S TRUST WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.
