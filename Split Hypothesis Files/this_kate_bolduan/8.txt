WHEN WILL HE CALL FOR AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CONDITIONS IN THESE BORDER PATROL FACILITIES?
SPEAKING ON THAT, IT WAS YESTERDAY THAT I SPOKE TO A LONGTIME VETERAN EL PASO BORDER PATROL AGENT WHO SAID THEY'RE TIRED OF SEEING THE CONDITIONS MIGRANTS ARE BEING HELD IN AND DECIDED TO SPEAK OUT,
SO LONG AS WE CONCEALED THEIR IDENTITY.
YOU'RE TAKING A BIG RISK BY DOING THIS.
