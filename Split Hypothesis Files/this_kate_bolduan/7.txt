WHAT'S UNCLEAR AT THIS MOMENT, WE WERE UNDER THE UNDERSTANDING THAT EARLIER THIS WEEK AN INVESTIGATION HAD ALREADY BEEN UNDER WAY.
THE POSTS WERE SAID TO HAVE BEEN TURNED OVER TO INTERNAL AFFAIRS AT CBP.
THE DHS INSPECTOR GENERAL IS ALSO SAID TO HAVE GOTTEN THEIR HANDS ON THESE SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS.
A BROADER QUESTION, WE'RE ALSO WONDERING IF HE'S CALLING FOR AN INVESTIGATION INTO THESE SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS.
