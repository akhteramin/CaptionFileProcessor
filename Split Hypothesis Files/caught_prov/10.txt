But I want Mr. Holder to know that... this doesn't give you a license in the future to say, "It's okay, I'll bring my counselor down and I can get out and get way with it", okay? I'm doing this based on his representation.
Do you understand that?
You explain it to him when he gets out 'cause he's homeless, okay? All right.
It's our intention to avoid it if at all possible. Thank you, Your Honor.
