All right. Here's what we're gonna do, Mr. Giacobbi. I'm gonna watch it.
Now there are two lines on Allens Avenue. There are two stop lines. If you are past the first stop line when the light turns red, I'll dismiss it. If you're not past it, it's gonna cost you 85 bucks. We're gonna take a look at it. Look up here.
It's already red, Judge. Show the time light. It was r red for 16.2 seconds, Judge.
If I look at this... this every day and... I'm supposed to know that when the light clicks three times that it's red. Supposed to know that. I think we're all supposed to know that.
