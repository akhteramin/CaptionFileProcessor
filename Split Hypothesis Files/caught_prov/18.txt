So, they send me this kind of a video in a court of law. I can't tell what color the light is. I know it changed three times, Inspector Quinn, but it went from white to white to white.
No, it didn't change at all, Judge.
It stayed... red according to the notice. But according to the video, I agree with you, Judge. I couldn't determine... No.
The answer is I am not convinced by clear and convincing evidence. They didn't present clear and convincing evidence to me that the light was red. I never saw red on the screen. I saw it all white.
