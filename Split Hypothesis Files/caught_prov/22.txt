You had a parking ticket on Thayer Street, sir.
Yes, um...
That day I wasn't driving the car. I was just getting out of the hospital 'cause I had brain surgery. And my son literally parked at the corner of CVS and I got in the car. And the lady said, "You know, you can't park. There's a fire hydrant." And I said, "All right, I understand, I had brain surgery, I had my helmet on." And then she says, "Yeah, sure." She didn't really believe me.
I got in the car, and then, you know, we left. And then I got the mail and the ticket. She didn't even give us a ticket on the windshield or anything.
