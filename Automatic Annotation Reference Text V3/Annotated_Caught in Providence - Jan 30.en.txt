 It got infected so they had to remove the bone like the skull.
 Francesca?
 Yes. Yes.
 If I follow normal protocol on this youll end up with no car.
 Announcer This is the courtroom of Judge Frank Caprio where people and cases are met with compassion a different kind of judge a courtroom like no other this is Caught in Providence. This is Mr.Holder Your Honor.
 Whos Mr.Holder?
 And are you here with him?
 Yes Im his counselor at the Riverwood program. That day I wasnt driving the car I was just getting out the hospital cause I had brain surgery and my son literally parked at the corner of CVS and I got in the car and the lady said You cant park there its a fire hydrant and I said oh alright I understand Ive had brain surgery I had my helmet on and then she says Yeah sure she didnt really believe me.
 Okay whos gonna do the speaking?
 I am at Mr.Holders request.
 Frank Alright what do you wanna tell me about this?
 Basically he received the ticket on Sunday morning it started all his first parkSaturday. I got in the car and then we left and then I got in the mail the ticket she didnt even give us a ticket on the way she was or anything.
 Im sorry?
 Saturday.
 Saturday morning Im sorry its not at all his first ticket.
 Hes had 31 tickets.
 Obviously Im his counselor for significant reasons at the same time its something that were working on engagingly with Mr.Holder and truthfully speaking the tickets are becoming further and further apart.
 He happened to have been parked across from Parenside Park in front of the old Bank of America building on this particular morning he was attending a church service.
 Sometimes he goes there also to meet up with his daughter whos currently in a homeless situation.
 So we are hoping that Your Honor could find a reason hopefully to waive this and know that were working actively in terms of keeping this from happening. I appreciate it Your Honor thank you.
 Is he homeless now? Alright case is dismissed.
 Currently speaking he lives with his father at an assisted living residence in East providence but actually we have an appointment next week with the Gateway group to hopefully line up housing affordable housing in North Providence.
 Tell me about the program I dont know what the program is about.
 Were a social services agency were under the Horizon Group we have two locations one in Providence one in Warren Rhode Island you know in the East Bay area.
 From there on out Mr.Holders been a longtime client of ours and Ive been working as his counselor throughout the last nine months.
 Whats the name of the program?
 Riverwood one word.
 Are you familiar with that?
 Ziggy No but I am familiar with Horizon I have heard of that.
 Its basically human services and social work primarily the role of the Providence program is to provide affordable housing for low income individuals.
 Based on your representations Im gonna dismiss it.
 Thank you. Thank you.
 But I want Mr.Holder to know that this doesnt give you a license in the future to say its okay Ill bring my counselor down I can get away with it okay Im doing this based on his representation.
 Do you understand that?
 You explain it to him when he gets out cause hes homeless okay alright.
 Its our intention to avoid it if at all possible thank you Your Honor.
 Okay. Okay. Okay.
 Im just trying to see if he gives me attitude. Yes we need to see it judge. Alright heres what were gonna do Mr.Giacobi Im gonna watch it. Now this is a beautiful car how much do I have to put down? To you three grand.
 Despite what you may be thinking I believe this motorist actually made two wise choices in court today the first having his social worker speak for him.
 Can you imagine what would have happened if he had opened his mouth?
 I think hed still be enjoying the hospitality of one of our local correctional institutions. If I look at this I look at this every day and Im supposed to know that when the light clicks three times that its red Im supposed to know that I think were all supposed to know that.
 The second is that he waited until he passed Inspector Kerrigan before he disrespected the judge.
 Trust me that may have been the wisest move of his life.
 Frank Anthony Michael Giacobi good morning Mr.Giacobi.
 Morning sir.
 What do your friends call you they call you Tony they call you AM what do they call you? I know it changed three times but I dont know if when it changed three times what color it was.
 I cant say what they call me. So they send me this kind of a video in a court of law I cant tell what color the light is I know it changed three times Inspector Quinn but it went from white to white to white. No it didnt change at all judge. I had brain cancer surgery and then it got infected so they had to remove the bone like the skull of my head.
 I expected that kind of an answer. I cant hear you speak into the mic. Alright.
 Where are you from Nevada? How are you feeling? Good.
 Yes sir.
 Yeah?
 What are you doing in Rhode Island?
 What am I doing?
 I moved back here stupidly.
 Are you calling me stupid?
 I was thinking about it but IListen Im gonna tell you something thats not nice.
 Mr.Giacobi youre charged with going through a red light on Allens Avenue and Terminal Street are we watching these today?
 We should watch it.
 Now there are two lines on Allens Avenue there are two stop lines if you are passed the first stop line when the light turns red Ill dismiss it if youre not passed it its gonna cost you 85 bucks were gonna take a look at it look up here. Ziggy Its already red judge show the time link it was red for 16.2 seconds judge.
 It stayed red according to the notice but according to the video I agree with you judge I couldnt determine as to whetherNo I am not convinced by clear and convincing evidence they didnt present clear and convincing evidence to me that the light was red I never saw red on the screen I saw it all white. Thats a very long story but the result is that Im gonna dismiss the case because the city has failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that you went through a red light. Now is there anything you wanna say?
 Oh.
 Hes never told me what your friends call you.
 What do your friends call you they call you Tony they call you Anthony what do they call you?
 His middle name.
 Thank you sir.
 Well I guess we had it coming the judge did ask him three times what his friends called him based on his response we know he wasnt lying he really is an bleep. Frank Josev Parentos.
