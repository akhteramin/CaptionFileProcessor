Kim Kardashian showed off her figure in this skin tight latex corseted dress Jeff Looks like a bottle of perfume. Sam by Thierry Mugler who came out of retirement to create the look which took you guys eight months to complete by the way. It appeared to be dripping wet thanks in part to the crystals and shimmery material.
 Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx made their public debut as a couple last night. While they didnt hit the pink carpet together the couple did pose for photos with one another inside and Kendall and Kylie Jenner broke out the feathers for their camp looks. Kendall wore bright orange feathered Versace gown while Kylie opted for a lilac look with a fur stohl Im hoping faux and a matching wig.
 Actress Janelle Monae embraced wearable art with this custom Christian Siriano look and the eye even winked as she walked down the pink carpet. Come on now.
 Lady Gaga served up multiple looks for her grand entrance to the event all created by Brandon Maxwell. It started off with a huge pink dress that took an army of men with umbrellas to wrangle she then stripped down to a black dress followed by a skin tight pink dress and then it all ended up with her posing in her underwear here it comes.

 Serena Williams wore this stunning neon yellow Versace gown with pink feathery leaf accents and she paired her look with neon Nikes.

 Kacey Musgraves looked like a barbie doll in this hot pink Moschino leather dress pairing it with a blow dryer bag and cat eye shades.
 Cardi B won the award for the biggest train with this red feathered Tom Brown gown.
 The 10 foot long train nearly took over the pink carpet and Cierra might have won best hair of the night I think she won lets be honest with this very extra gorgeous afro. She also wore a custom Peter Dundas emerald green crown because she is a queen and Zendaya had a fairy tale moment at the gala transforming into Cinderella in this Tommy Hilfiger ball gown with white poofy sleeves and a skirt that lit up yes yes yes.

 It took all those people got together to entertain us I agree.
 like thats all I mean its just like somebodys gotta shake it up a little bit we all cant wear khakis and polo shirts somebodys gotta shake it up and push the envelope a little bit thats what art does.
 Im for universal uniforms everyday.

 And this is a guy that is gender fluid and he used prosthetics as the eyes Wow! And you really get that kid Wait wait wait those werent real eyes? Those were real eyes.
 I know I dont know what I said it like that. But its about the artifice and the exaggeration and I like the gender fluidity that was all over the red carpet Sam It was. Yeah I loved that too Im with you Al?
 the pink carpet excuse me.
 Imma nod my head and pretend like I know what artifice means.
 Sam laughs The artificialness like its fake like camp is very kitschy and fake and over done. Sam Right now.

 You nailed it you nailed it Jeff do you have a favorite?
 Hey Im gonna listen I think all the work that these fashion designers put into these outfits I really wanna give them some credit I know Al Sam who was your favorite?
 Sam Janelle Monae that is a work of art.
 That dress is art you guys and then again with the gender fluidity I think that Jared Leto with that gorgeous red Gucci gown and then who doesnt love a severed head as a purse.
 I really didnt even notice he was wearing a gown and I think thats the way if you dont want people to notice just carry another head. I think it was or an accessory but he held it like a purse.
 I really did not notice he was wearing a gown till you said something. Jeff Wait thats a purse? I believe it was a purse.
