 7WELCOME SPECIAL NIGHT AT ST. ANSELM COLLEGE IN MANCHESTER NEW HAMPSHIRE.
 IM ANDERSON COOPER.
 WE ARE JUST GETTING STARTED WITH OUR CNN PRESIDENTIAL TOWN HALL EVENT.
 IN THE LAST HOUR YOU HEARD FROM SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR.
 LATER TONIGHT YOULL SEE CORY SANDERS KAMALA HARRIS AND PETE BUTTIGIEG.
 TO PULL THIS EVENT OFF CNN HAS PARTNERED WITH HARVARD UNIVERSITYS COLLEGE OF POLITICS.
 ALSO WITH THE NEW HAMPSHIRE INSTITUTE OF POLITICS RIGHT HERE AT ST. ANSELM COLLEGE.
 THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT THE CANDIDATES WILL TAKE QUESTIONS FROM THESE YOUNG COLLEGE STUDENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS WHO ARE IN THE AUDITORIUM WHO SAY THEY PLAN TO VOTE IN THEIR STATES DEMOCRATIC PRIMARIES AND CAUCUSES.
 WELCOME TO THE STAGE PLEASE SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN.
 HI. HI.
 ITS GOOD TO SEE YOU.
 HAVE A SEAT?
 ARE WE GOING TO DO STUDENTS?
 LETS GO RIGHT TO IT.
 IN THAT CASE I WANT CLOSER.
 HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE ONES IN THE BACK.
 I WANT TO START WITH YOUR BIG ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY ABOUT COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY.
 IT COULD IMPACT A LOT OF STUDENTS HERE.
 I WANT TO BRING IN DENA MILLER FROM MASSACHUSETTS.
 SHYS A JUNIOR STUDYING HISTORY. DENA.
 HI SENATOR.
 I LIKE SO MANY OTHER STUDENTS HAD TO TAKE OUT LOANS TO PAY FOR MY EDUCATION THAT I WILL BE PAYING FOR YEARS.
 WHAT IS YOUR PLAN FOR STUDENT DEBT?
 THANKS FOR THE QUESTION DENA.
 THIS IS THE AMERICA WE LIVE IN NOW.
 BASICALLY TO GET A SHOT AT A MIDDLE CLASS LIFE YOUVE GOT TO HAVE SOME POST HIGH SCHOOL TECHNICAL TRAINING TWOYEAR COLLEGE FOURYEAR COLLEGE MAYBE GRADUATE SCHOOL DEPENDING ON WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOURE ENDING UP DOING.
 THE POSITION OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN GOOD LUCK TO YOU YOURE ON YOUR OWN.
 THE ONE THING THEYVE DONE THETHEY H HAVE DONE IS LENT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO STUDENTS.
 IT IS CRUSHING THEM.
 MY PROPOSAL IS TO SAY THIS ISNT RIGHT.
 WHAT WE HAVE TO DO AS A COUNTRY IS ROLL BACK THAT DEBT.
 SO I HAVE TWO PARTS TO THE PROPOSAL.
 PART ONE IS THAT WE SAY THAT WERE GOING TO ROLL BACK STUDENT LOAN DEBT FOR ABOUT 95 OF STUDENTS WHO HAVE DEBT.
 THATS PART ONE.
 AND PART TWO IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE NEVER GET IN THIS MESS AGAIN ON STUDENT LOAN DEBT AND THAT IS TO MAKE COLLEGE UNIVERSALLY AVAILABLE WITH FREE TUITION AND FEES AND TO PUT MORE MONEY INTO PELL GRANTS SO THAT STUDENTS OF COLOR SO THAT OUR POOREST STUDENTS HAVE REAL ACCESS TO COLLEGE AND THAT WE PUT REAL MONEY INTO OUR UNIVERSITIES.BLACK COLLEGES AND THIS IS ABOUT OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERYONE.
 AND CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW TO PAY FOR IT? THAT IS THE CRITICISM FOR REPUBLICANS HOW TO PAY FOR IT.
 I WAS JUST ABOUT TO ASK FOR IT.
 CENTRIST DEMOCRATS SAY DOESNT THIS FEED THE NARRATIVE THAT DEMOCRATS WANT TO GIVE EVERYTHING AWAY FOR FREE.
 LETS REMEMBER WHERE THIS ALL STARTED.
 I STARTED SEVERAL MONTHS AGO ABOUT A WEALTH TAX.
 ITS 2 CENTS ON EVERY DOLLAR ABOVE THE GREAT FORTUNES ABOVE 50 MILLION DOLLARS.
 SO YOUR 50 MILLIONTH AND FIRST DOLLAR YOU HAVE TO PAY TWO CENTS ON ALL OF THE DOLLARS AFTER THAT.
 HERES THE STUNNING PART.
 IF WE ASK THE GREAT FORTUNES IN THIS COUNTRY UNDERSTAND THIS ISNT ABOUT TRYING TO BE NASTY OR SAY YOUVE DONE ANYTHING WRONG WHAT ITS ABOUT IS SAYING LOOK YOU HAD A GREAT IDEA.
 YOU GOT OUT THERE.
 YOU WORKED HARD OR YOU INHERITED WELL. WHICHEVER ONE IT WAS.
  APPLAUSE  BUT NOW THAT YOUVE GOT THAT GREAT FORTUNE SPEND JUST A MINUTE TO REMEMBER HOW YOU GOT IT.
 YOU BUILT THAT GREAT BUSINESS OR YOUR ANCESTORS DID USING WORKERS THAT ALL OF US HELPED PAY TO EDUCATE.
 YOU GOT YOUR GOODS TO MARKET USING ROADS AND BRIDGES THAT ALL OF US HELPED PAY TO BUILD.
 YOU ARE PROTECTED IN YOUR FACTORIES WITH FIREFIGHTERS AND POLICE OFFICERS THAT ALL OF US HELPED TO PAY.
 AND WE SAY GOOD FOR YOU THAT YOU HAVE NOW GOTTEN THIS GREAT FORTUNE BUT TWO CENTS.
 YOUVE GOT TO PAY SOMETHING BACK SO EVERYBODY ELSE GETS A CHANCE.
 AND HERES HOW THE MONEY WORKS OUT.
 IF WE PUT THAT TWO CENT WEALTH TAX IN PLACE ON THE 75000 LARGEST FORTUNES IN THIS COUNTRY TWO CENTS WE CAN DO UNIVERSAL CHILD CARE FOR EVERY BABY ZERO TO 5 UNIVERSAL PREK UNIVERSAL COLLEGE AND KNOCK BACK THE STUDENT LOAN DEBT BURDEN FOR 95 OF OUR STUDENTS AND STILL HAVE NEARLY A TRILLION DOLLARS LEFT OVER.
  APPLAUSE  YEAH.
 I WANT YOU TO THI1  M MICK FROM PENNSYLVANIA.
 HI MEGHAN.
 SHES A GRADUATE STUDENT AT HARVARD AND M.I.T.
 SHES A CONTRIBUTOR AT FORBES.
 YOU MAKE ME FEEL LIKE A SCHLUB.
 I MEAN  WHAT DO YOU DO IN YOUR SPARE TIME MEGHAN?
 ITS GOOD TO SEE YOU.
 THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
 SO AMAZONS MONOPOLY MEANS I CAN BUY GENERIC GOODS AND BRANDS FROM MY PHONE AND RECEIVE THEM ON MY DOORSTEP WITHOUT A DELIVERY FEE WITHIN 24 HOURS.
 HOW IS BREAKING UP BIG TECH GOOD FOR ME? OKAY.
 GOOD QUESTION MEGHAN.
 HERES WHAT WE WANT TO REMEMBER ABOUT AMAZON ABOUT GOOGLE ABOUT APPLE ABOUT A LOT OF THESE GIANT TECH COMPANIES.
 THEY ACTUALLY RUN TWO BUSINESSES.
 SO ONE IS THE PLATFORM.
 THATS THE PLACE WHERE PEOPLE COME TO BUY AND SELL GOODS.
 THATS WHERE YOU GO TO GET WHATEVER IT IS YOU KNOW YOU CAN COMPARE 48 PRINTERS AND GET IT ALL DELIVERED IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS.
 GOT IT.
 COOL.
 THATS THE PLATFORM.
 JUST SO YOU GET AN IDEA OF THE SCALE HERE FOR AMAZON WALMART DOES ABOUT 9 OF ALL RETAIL SALES IN AMERICA.
 IF YOU WANT TO SELL ONLINE AMAZON IS DOING ABOUT 49 OF ALL RETAIL SALES THAT ARE HAPPENING IN AMERICA.
 SO THAT IS THE MARKETPLACE.
 SO AMAZON RUNS THE MARKETPLACE.
 IM COOL WITH THAT.
 IM ALL FOR A MARKETPLACE BUT AMAZON DOES A SECOND THING AND THAT IS THEY COLLECT INFORMATION ON EVERY BUYER AND SELLER WHO COMES THROUGH.
