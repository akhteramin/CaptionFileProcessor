 IT COULD HAVE BEEN SPENT ON PARKS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND POTHOLES ON CERTAIN ROAD RICK GW PARKWAY.
 MAINTENANCE NEEDS THE PARK SERVICE IS ALREADY STRUGGLING TO PATLE.
 THEY WANT TO PROTECT NATIONAL PARKS AND PROVIDE MONEY NECESSARY TO ADDRESS BACKLOG OF PARK SERVICE AND THEN THEY USE VALUABLE DOLLARS FROM PARK VISITORS TO PAY FOR THIS SPECTACLE.
 AND I REACHED OUT TO THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE WITH A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND THEY DEPOSIT ANSWER ANY.
 THEY SENT A STATEMENT DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR IS COMMITTED TO PROVIDING AMERICAN PEOPLE FANTASTIC CELEBRATION OF NATIONS BIRTHDAY AND DOING SO CONSISTENT WITH THE DEPARTMENTS MISSION AND HISTORICAL PRACTICES.

 AND PRESIDENT SALUTE TO AMERICA TOMORROW IS EXPECTED TO ATTRACT PROTESTERS.
 MEMBERS OF CODE PINK PLAN TO DEM SCAIT.
 THE EVENT IS TURN INTO MILITARY STIFLE FORCE AND DOES NOT REPRESENT TRUE MEANING OF INDEPENDENCE DAY.
 THEY WANTED TO FLY BADE TRUMP BALLOON WE HAVE SEEN IN LONDON AND OTHER PARTS OF EUROPE. THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE DEP EYED THE REQUEST.
 EVEN FT. BALLOON CANNOT NATURE GROUP WILL TAKE A STAND.
 WE DO THINK ITS IMPORTANT TO OPPOSE WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS DOINGIM D.C. RESIDENT AND WE KNOW THAT LAST TIME PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTED TO HAVE A MILITARY PARADE D.C.
 RESIDENTS SPOKE OUT SO FORCEFULLY AND REPRESENTATIVES IN CITY COUNCIL SAID NO WAY.
 CODE PINK AGAIN WANTED TO FLY THAT BABY TRUMP BALLOON TWO FEET OVER THE GROUND AND THE PARK SERVICE GROUNDED THAT IDEA.
