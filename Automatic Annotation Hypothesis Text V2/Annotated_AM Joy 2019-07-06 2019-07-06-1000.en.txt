WELL THIS WEEK ON AMERICAS BIRTHDAY KNOWN AS INDEPENDENCE DAY OR SIMPLY JULY 4 DONALD TRUMP THREW HIMSELF A PARTY.
EVER SINCE HE SAW THAT THE FRENCH PRESIDENT HAS A PARADE ITS CALLED BASTILLE DAY AND THE DICTATOR OF NORTH KOREA HAS A PARADE ITS CALLED AUTHORITARIANISM AND THAT THEY GET TO HAVE TANKS AND PEOPLE MARCHING IN FRONT OF THEM AND SALUTING THEM AND ALL OF THAT STUFF HES WANTED TO HAVE ONE TOO.
HE TRIED TO COOP OTHER HOLIDAYS LIKE VETERANS DAY AND MEMORIAL DAY BUT THE ADULTS IN THE MILITARY KEPT PUSHING HIM BACK.
NO MORE.
DONALD TRUMP FINALLY GOT HIS SPECIAL DONALD TRUMP PARADE ROLLING TANKS DOWN THE STREETS OF YOUR CAPITAL FLYING AIR FORCE PLANES OVER HIS HEAD WHILE HE GAVE AN ODD SPEECH ABOUT THE AIRPORTS THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS TOOK CONTROL OF DURING THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR?
IN JUNE OF 1775 THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS CREATED A UNIFIED ARMY OUT OF THE REVOLUTIONARY FORCES ENCAMPED AROUND BOSTON AND NEW YORK.
THE CONTINENTAL ARMY SUFFERED A BITTER WINTER OF VALLEY FORGE FOUND GLORY ACROSS THE WATERS OF THE DELAWARE AND SEIZED VICTORY FROM CORN WALLACE OF YORK TOWN.
IT RAN THE RAMPARTS IT TOOK OVER THE AIRPORTS IT DID EVERYTHING IT HAD TO DO AND AT FORT McHENDRY UNDER THE ROCKETS RED GLARE IT HAD NOTHING BUT VICTORY.
IM SURE YOU KNOW THIS ALREADY BECAUSE YOU PAID ATTENTION IN SCHOOL BUT JUST SO THAT ITS SAID THE CONTINENTAL ARMY WAS NOT NAMED AFTER GEORGE WASHINGTON.
THERE WAS NO AIR TRAVEL DURING THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR.
AIRPLANES WERENT EVEN INVENTED UNTIL 1903 AND THE BATTLE AT FORT McHENDRY HAPPENED DURING THE WAR OF 1812.
IN THE END FOR MILLIONS OF YOUR TAX DOLLARS THIS IS ACTUALLY WHAT DONALD TRUMP GOT.
ON THIS DAY 243 YEARS AGO OUR FOUNDING FATHERS PLEDGED THEIR LIVES THEIR FORTUNES AND THEIR SACRED HONOR TO DECLARE INDEPENDENCE AND DEFEND OUR GOD GIVEN RIGHTS.
NOT AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT BUT WHAT LOOKS LIKE AN AUTHORITARIAN LEADER FESTOONED BY HIS MILITARY AND MAKING A SHOW OF FORCE TO WELL ITS NOT REALLY CLEAR WHO BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP ACTUALLY REALLY LIKES DICTATORS.
JOINING ME NOW IS PRESIDENT O AND CEO OF LATINO.
CRAIG UNGER VANITY FAIR CONTRIBUTOR AND AUTHOR OF HOUSE OF TRUMP HOUSE OF PUTIN AND REPRESENTATIVE TED LOU DEMOCRAT FROM CALIFORNIA AND A MEMBER OF THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND JUDICIARY COMMITTEES.
I WANT TO GO TO YOU FIRST CONGRESSMAN WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF IT WATCHING AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT DO THIS THING THAT TOM NICHOLS WHO IS A SOVIET EXPERT ON THE HISTORY OF THE SOVIET UNION AND OF THAT REGION DESCRIBED AS LOOKING LIKE AN OLD SOVIET KIND OF YOU KNOW PARADE.
THANK YOU JOY FOR YOUR QUESTION.
LET ME JUST FIRST SAY THAT NATURAL DISASTER LIKE EARTHQUAKES CAN STRIKE AT ANY TIME AND I URGE TO BE PREPARED WITH SUPPLIES AND A SAFETY PLAN.
TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS WITH TRUMPS JULY 4th EVENT IS IT WAS A CAMPAIGN EVENT PAID FOR BY THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER.
NOT ONLY DID HE DIVERT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO THIS EVENT HE HAD THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE GIVE OUT PASSES VIP PASSES TO MAJOR DONORS.
THAT WAS OUTRAGEOUS.
A VIOLATION OF OUR ETHICS AND HE MADE A MOCKERY OF OUR INDEPENDENCE DAY.
THANK YOU FOR MENTIONING WHATS GOING ON IN YOUR STATE.
WE JUST SAW TWO NATURAL DISASTER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO THIS IS A TIME WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY HAS PRIORITIES THAT ARE IMPORTANT THAT WE SHOULD BE SPENDING MONEY ON THINGS LIKE MAKING SURE THAT STATES ARE READY FOR NATURAL DISASTER LIKE YOU JUST SAW IN YOUR STATE.
WHEN YOU SEE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES DIVERTING MONEY SO HE CAN HAVE PLANES FLY OVER HIM RATHER THAN SPENDING THE MONEY ON IMPORTANT THINGS LIKE THAT OR MAYBE UNCAGING CHILDREN WHICH HES ALSO DOING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ARIZONA AND OTHER PLACES AS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS IS THERE SOMETHING THAT YOU PLAN TO DO ABOUT THAT.
THIS DOES SEEM LIKE A TREMENDOUS WASTE OF MONEY.
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS CANT USE OFFICIAL RESOURCES TO PARTICIPATE IN A PARADE.
IN THIS CASE TRUMP DIVERTS 2.5 MILLION OF NATIONAL PARK FEES TO PAY FOR HIS PARTY AND IVE ASKED THE FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION TO LOOK INTO THIS BECAUSE HOW CAN YOU HAVE ALL OF THIS TAXPAYER MONEY DO THIS EVENT AND HAVE THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE BE INVOLVED HANDING OUT VIP PASSES TO THE MAJOR DONORS.
YEAH AND BESIDES THAT I WANT TO GO TO YOU CRAIG UNGER YOU HAVE WRITTEN A LOT ABOUT DONALD TRUMP HIS MAFIA SORT OF RELATIONSHIPS THAT HE HAS HAD THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO RUSSIA.
AMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA TWEETED AFTER DONALD TRUMPS WEIRD PARADE.
HE SAID I KNEW THIS WAS COMING TWEET FROM JULIA DAVIS NEWS RUSSIA STATE TV IS OBSESSIVELY BASHING TRUMPS LOW ENERGY WEAK PARADE WITH RUSTY TANKS THE HOSTS LOL AT TRUMPS CLAIMS THERES YOUR CITY UPON A HILL A WORLD LEADER AND MARTIANS HAVE BEEN DEFEATED.
DONALD TRUMP NOT ONLY WASTED AMERICAS MONEY TO MAKE HIMSELF A CAMPAIGN COMMERCIAL BUT ALSO HAS SUBJECTED THE UNITED STATES TO MOCKERY BECAUSE REAL DICTATORSHIPS KNOW WHAT A DICTATOR PARADE IS SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE CRAIG.
AT LEAST SOMETIMES THEY GET THEIR FACTS STRAIGHT AND I MEAN ITS INTERESTING THAT IF THE RUSSIAN STATE TV IS GOING AFTER TRUMP THAT DOESNT HAPPEN WITHOUT VLADIMIR PUTINS SAY SO.
ITS ALSO INTERESTING THE CLIP YOU SHOWED THE NUMBER OF HISTORICAL ERRORS IN IT IS JUST EXTRAORDINARY AND THE WHITE HOUSE HAS AN OFFICE OF SPEECH WRITING WITH LOTS OF RESEARCHERS AND INTERNS AND THEY FACT CHECK THINGS AND THERE ARE ONLY THREE POSSIBILITIES FOR THAT LEVEL OF STUPIDITY TO TAKE PLACE.
ONE IS THAT THAT OFFICE IS COMPLETELY FILLED WITH PEOPLE WITH ROOM TEMPERATURE IQ THE OTHER IS THAT ALL THE PROCEDURES HAVE FALLEN APART AND THEY DONT EXIST ANYMORE AND THE THIRD POSSIBILITY IS ITS SPRAYING FROM THE BRAIN OF DONALD TRUMP AND THAT IS DEEPLY DEEPLY DISTURBING.
YEAH THERES A LOT ABOUT IT THATS DISTURBING LONNIE IM GOING TO GO TO YOU ON THIS IM GLAD YOURE HERE TO HAVE A HISTORICAL CONTEXT.
DONALD TRUMP ADMIRES DICTATOR SHIPS AROUND THE WORLD.
ALL OF THE MEDIA IS HIS VERSION BASTILLE DAY CEREMONY.
I POINTED OUT EARLIER THIS WEEK THE WHOLE BASTILLE DAY THING IS ABOUT SENDING A MESSAGE TO DICTATORS.
THATS WHAT THE WHOLE BASTILLE DAY IS ABOUT.
DONALD TRUMP LIKES DICTATORS.
THATS CLEARLY NOT WHAT THIS IS.
WHAT WAS THE MESSAGE THAT YOU THINK CAME OUT OF WHAT DONALD TRUMP DID THIS WEEK?
IT WAS GRANDIOSITY AND SELFINFLATION AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK THATS SIGNIFICANT HERE IS THAT THE UNITED STATES AT LEAST IN THEORY IS SUPPOSED TO OPERATE ON THE DOCTRINE THAT WE ARE A NATION OF LAWS THAT NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW AND THAT THE CONSTITUTION IS THE FUNDAMENTAL AUTHORITY.
THAT IS A DIFFERENT POSITION FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT POSITION THAN A STATE IN WHICH THE PERSONALITY OR THE AUTHORITARIAN LEADER IS THE HEAD OF ALL INTEREST AND IDEAS WITHIN THE STATE AND SO WHAT DONALD TRUMP DID WAS ESSENTIALLY HIJACK THIS IDEA AND TURN IT INTO SOMETHING THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO GLORIFY ITSELF.
ITS AN INTERESTING PARADOX HERE WHICH IS THAT SEVERAL YEARS AGO I DID A FULL BRIGHT FELLOWSHIP AND SPENT AN ENTIRE SEMESTER IN MOSCOW TEACHING AT MOSCOW STATE UNIVERSITY AND AT THE END OF THE SEMESTER THERE WAS THE MAY 9th CELEBRATION.
ANYBODY WHO HAS BEEN TO RUSSIA OR KNOWS YOU KNOW ABOUT THEIR HISTORY POST WORLD WAR II MAY 9th IS A GIGANTIC CELEBRATION THAT HAPPENS EACH YEAR SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE FOURTH OF JULY AND NEW YEARS AND IT IS A RECOGNITION OF THE SOVIET DEFEAT NAZI THREAT AN THREAT IN WORLD WAR II.
I WAS THERE FOR THE PARADE AND THERES THIS COMPLETE PROCESSION OF MILITARY VEHICLES.
THEIR MISSILES TANKS ARMORED VEHICLES THEIR JEEPS AND IT LOOKS LIKE AN ARMY AMASSING FOR AN INVASION.
SOMEONE TURNS TO ME AND SAYS DO YOU DO THE SAME THING IN THE UNITED STATES ON THE FOURTH OF JULY.
I SAID NO THIS WOULD NEVER HAPPEN IN THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE THEY IN THE UNITED STATES BELIEVER THERE SHOULD BE A REALLY CLEAR DISTINCTION BETWEEN CIVILIAN AUTHORITY AND MILITARY MIGHT AND THAT OUR AUTHORITY IS SUPPOSED TO AT LEAST IN THEORY STEM FROM OUR LAWS AND OUR MORAL BELIEVES.
AND WHAT DONALD TRUMP DID WAS ESSENTIALLY INVERT THAT TO CREATE IT AS THE KIND OF SATIRICAL ALMOST EMULATION OF SOMETHING THAT HE SEES IN VLADIMIR PUTIN WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE THIS AS THE ANTIDEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT THAT IT ACTUALLY WAS.
YEAH I MEAN THAT IS AN EXCELLENT POINT.
HE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT TRUMP TRIED TO MAKE HIMSELF LOOK BIG FROM THIS PIECE.
IT WAS CLEAR FROM THE BEGINNING THAT INDEPENDENCE MEANT NOTHING MORE THAN A MADE FOR TELEVISION EVENT AND AN EGO MESSAGE.
IT INVOKED MOCKERY.
THERES A CARTOON THATS DRAWN ON WHAT AIRPLANES WOULD LOOK LIKE DURING THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR.
ITS BEN FRANKLIN ATTACHED TO TWO KITES AND THIS IS BY SOMEBODY I KNOW THE GREAT NATALIE JOHNSON WHO DREW THAT.
HERES THE REALITY DONALD TRUMP IT SEEMS WANTS TO BE SEEN AS THIS BIG MAN RIGHT HE WANTS TO BE SEEN AS THIS GRAND LEADER OF THIS GREAT MILITARY BUT WHAT HE ACTUALLY CAN ACCOMPLISH THROUGH HIS OWN YOU KNOW THE QUALITY OF THE STAFF THAT HE HAS AROUND HIM IS HE CANT DO THAT.
THE REALITY IS EVEN IN THE CASE OF RUSSIA WHICH NOW IS AN ADVERSARY OF THE UNITED STATES DURING WORLD WAR II THEY WERE FIGHTING THE NAZIS.
IF THEYRE DOING A BIG CELEBRATION TALKING ABOUT DEFEATING THE NAZI EMPIRE THEYRE SENDING A MESSAGE AGAIN TO DICTATORS.
THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF PARADES THAT AND ONE IN NORTH KOREA.
HE DOESNT EVEN KNOW HOW.
OR REALLY WHY.
WE DONT HAVE TO SHOW THAT TYPE OF DISPLAY OF FORCE BECAUSE THE WORLD ALREADY KNOWS IT AND WHAT I FOUND SO DISAPPOINTING WHEN IT CAME TO JULY 4th IS JULY 4th IS TO COMMEMORATE OUR ROOTS AS AMERICANS THE FACT THAT WE FLED DIFFERENT COUNTRIES HERE AND RECOGNIZE THAT OUR DNA IS WERE A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS AND WE HAVE STRENGTH AND DONT HAVE TO SHOW MILITARY MIGHT BECAUSE THE WORLD KNOWS IT AND WHAT DONALD TRUMP DID WAS A SAD DISPLAY.
WE ARE THE LARGEST MILITARY OPERATION IN THE WORLD.
