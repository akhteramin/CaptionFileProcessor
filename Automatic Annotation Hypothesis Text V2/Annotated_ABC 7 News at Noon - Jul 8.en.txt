 LATEST.Reporter IT WILL BE THE SHOW OF A LIFETIME PRESIDENT TRUMP Reporter IT WILL BE THE SHOW OF A LIFETIME PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS PROMISED ON TWITTER AHEAD OF HRAVAGANT FOURTH OF JULY CELEBRATION.

 WE WILL HAVE PLANES GONG OVERHEAD THE BEST FIGHTER JETS IN THE WORLD AND OTHER PLANES THE EVENT IS SETTING OF MORE THAN PYROTECHNIC DEVICES BUT IT IS ALSO SPARKING BACKLASH FROM CRITICS WHO ACCUSE THE PRESIDENT OF STAGING GLORIFIED CAMPAIGN RALLY AND TURNING THE CELEBRATION INTO A PARTISAN EVENT.
 THE EVENT IS FREE BUT THE WHITE HOUSE HAS GIVEN VIP TICKETS TO THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE AND TOP DONORS BUT CARSON AND 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES SETH MOULTON CALLING THE TRUMP CELEBRATION UNAMERICAN.
 IT REMINDS ME OF THE SOVIET UNION.
 IT IS UNPATRIOTIC BECAUSE MILITARISM IS NOT WHAT AMERICAN PATRIOTISM IS ABOUT.
 ABOUT.Reporter AS FOR THE PRICE TAG BUT RATHER THE MINISTRATION Reporter AS FOR THE PRICE TAG BUT RATHER THE MINISTRATION NOR THE PENTAGON HAS SCHOOLS WITH THE COST WILL BE TO TAXPAYERS.

 COMING UP NEXT AT NOON. IT IS PROBABLY THE LARGE DISPLAY OF STARS AND STRIPES YOU SEE THIS HOLIDAY WITH FIND OUT WHERE THIS IS. PLUS. WEEK REMOVED SUPREME COURT DECISION BLOCKING DEMONSTRATION FROM ADDING A CITIZENSHIP QUESTION TO THE 2020 CENSUS.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP IS NOTIFIED JOINING THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ARE WORKING VERY HARD ON THIS EVEN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY. THAT MESSAGE CONTRADICTING THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS ANNOUNCEMENT THAT CENSUS FORMS ARE BEING PRINTED WITHOUT THE QUESTION ARE YOU A U.S. CITIZEN.
 I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO FIND OUT IF SOMEBODY IS A CITIZEN AS OPPOSED TO AN ILLEGAL.
 WHAT A PERSON IS INSISTENT THAT THE FIGHT FOR THE CITIZENSHIP QUESTION IS ONGOING HIS COMMENTS HAVE SPARKED CONFUSION. MARYLAND FEDERAL JUDGE CONVENED A CONFERENCE CALL ON WAS AFTER SHE SAW THE PRESENCE TO SAYING THAT REPORTS THAT THE QUESTION HAD BEEN DROPPED OR FAKE. ON THE CALL THEY CANNOT EXPLAIN THE PRESIDENTS RHETORIC BUT WHENWE ARE SICK THE TWEET THIS ONE WAS THE FIRST I HAD HEARD OF THE PRESIDENTS POSITION ON THIS ISSUE.
