FOR HOSTING THIS EVENT.
 ITS BEEN AN AMAZING NIGHT. RIGHT NOW ITS TIME TO WELCOME TO THIS STAGE SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS OF CALIFORNIA.
 FIVE OF THE TOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES HAVE SHARING THE SAME STAGE TONIGHT WITH YOUNG ADULTS FOR STUDENTS WHO PLAN TO VOTE IN THEIR STATE AND PRIMARY CAUCUSES.
 WEVE ALREADY HEARD FROM SENATORS AMY KLOBUCHAR ELIZABETH WARREN AND BERNIE SANDERS.
 HI HI.
 GOOD TO SEE YOU.
 HAVE A SEAT.
 THANK YOU.
 WOW THEYRE HAPPY TO SEE YOU.
 GOOD TO SEE YOU GUYS.
 LETS GET TO IT. WE WANT YOU TO GET AS MUCH OUT OF THE NEXT HOUR AS POSSIBLE.
 LETS START WITH WHATS DOMINATING THE NEWS THE FALLOUT FROM THE MUELLER REPORT.
 YES.
 WE HAVE A QUESTION FROM C CARCARLA ALVARADO A SENIOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS.
 GOOD EVENING SENATOR HARRIS IN LIGHT OF MUELLERS REPORT DO YOU BELIEVE THE DEMOCRATS A CONGRESS SHOULD RECONSIDER THEIR POSITION ON IMPEACHMENT?
 IT DEPENDS ON WHO YOURE TALKING TO ON WHAT THEIR POSITION IS HERES WHAT I FEEL ABOUT IT AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CARLA.
 LOOK FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THE INVESTIGATION AND HAVE SEEN ANY PART OF THAT REPORT IT IS VERY CLEAR THAT THERE IS A LOT OF GOOD EVIDENCE POINTING TO OBSTRUCTION AND OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.
 AND I BELIEVE VERY STRONGLY FIRST OF ALL LET ME JUST BE VERY CLEAR THE TABLE SET.
 I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO GET RID OF THIS PRESIDENT. THATS WHY IM RUNNING TO BECOME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
 THAT IS PART OF THE PREMISE OBVIOUSLY OF MY PLAN.
 BUT I THINK WE ARE VERY GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS AN INVESTIGATION THAT HAS BEEN CONDUCTED WHICH HAS PRODUCED EVIDENCE THAT TELLS US THAT THIS PRESIDENT AND HIS ADMINISTRATION ENGAGED IN OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.
 I BELIEVE CONGRESS SHOULD TAKE THE STEPS TOWARDS IMPEACHMENT.
 BUT I WANT TO SAY THIS BECAUSE IT DOESNT END THERE. I ALSO WANT TO SAY THIS.
 IM ALSO A REALIST.
 AND WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING OVER THE TWO YEARS AND SOME MONTHS IVE BEEN IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE I HAVE ALSO WITNESSED FOLKS IN THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS AND IN PARTICULAR IN THE GOP WHO HAVE BEEN PRESENTED WITH MANY REASONS TO PUSH BACK AGAINST THIS PRESIDENT AND THEY HAVE NOT.
 AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THE IMPEACHMENT PROCESS THERE WILL BE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE HOUSE AND AN INVESTIGATION THAT TAKES PLACE.
 I THINK WE CAN BE PRETTY SURE IT LOOKS LIKE THAT IS VERY LIKELY TO HAPPEN AND THEN ITS GOING TO GO OVER TO THE SENATE.
 AND THE HOUSE NEEDS TO BE A VOTE BY A MAJORITY A SIMPLE MAJORITY AND THEN ITS GOING TO COME OVER TO THE SENATE AND IVE NOT SEEN ANY EVIDENCE SINCE IVE BEEN IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE THAT SENATE AND THE REPUBLICANS HOLD THE MAJORITY IVE NOT SEEN ANY EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT THEY WILL WEIGH ON THE FACTS INSTEAD OF ON PARTISAN ADHERENCE TO BEING PROTECTIVE OF THIS PRESIDENT AND THATS WHAT CONCERNS ME AND WHAT WILL BE THE EVENTUAL OUTCOME.
 WE HAVE TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT THE END RESULT BUT THAT DOESNT MEAN THE PROCESS SHOULD NOT TAKE HOLD.
 THANK YOU SENATOR.
 A LOT OF STUDENTS HERE AT THE HARVARD INSTITUTE OF POLITICS THEYRE CONCERNED ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE AND HOW THAT AFFECTS THEM AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS.
 BEN.
 THANK YOU SENATOR AS A FUTURE EDUCATOR I AM REALLY BOTHERED THAT PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE BEING TARGETS FOR MASS SHOOTINGS.
 TWO DAYS AGO WAS THE 20th ANNIVERSARY OF THE COLUMBINE MASSACRE BUT TWO DECADES LATER NO MAJOR GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION HAS BEEN PASSED.
 AS PRESIDENT WHO WILL YOU GO ABOUT KEEPING OUR SCHOOLS SAFE AND KEEPING GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO SHOULD NOT HAVE THEM?
 IM SURE THERE ARE PLENTY OF STUDENTS HERE WHILE YOU WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL EVEN MIDDLE SCHOOL THAT YOU HAD TO PARTICIPATE IN A DRILL RIGHT WHERE YOU WERE CONVENED AND YOUR TEACHERS TAUGHT YOU ABOUT HOW YOU NEED TO GO AND RUN IN A CLOSET BECAUSE THERE MAY BE A MASS SHOOTER ROAMING THE HALLWAYS OF YOUR SCHOOL.
 AND IN OUR AMERICA THAT SHOULD NEVER HAVE TO HAPPEN.
 CONVERSATIONS TAKE PLACE EVERY NIGHT CONVERSATIONS TAKE PLACE EVERY NIGHT BETWEEN STATUTES AND THEIR PARENTS WHY DO THESE THINGS HAVE TO HAPPEN WHY DO WE HAVE A DRILL LIKE THAT AND THE RESPONSE IS THERE ARE PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON D.C. SUPPOSED LEADERS WHO HAVE FAILED TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO REJECT A FALSE CHOICE WHICH YOURE EITHER IN FAVOR OF SECOND AMENDMENT OR YOU WANT TO TAKE PEOPLES GUNS AWAY.
 SUPPOSED LEADERS IN WASHINGTON D.C. TO HAVE FAILED THE COURAGE TO RECOGNIZE YOU WANT TO GO HUNTING THATS FINE BUT WE NEED REASONABLE GUN SAFETY LAWS IN THIS COUNTRY STARTING WITH UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS AND A RENEWAL OF THE ASSAULT WEAPON BAN BUT THEY HAVE FAILED TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO ACT.
 BEN HERE IS MY RESPONSE TO YOU.
 UPON BEING ELECTED I WILL GIVE THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS 100 DAYS TO GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER AND HAVE THE COURAGE TO PASS REASONABLE GUN SAFETY LAWS.
 AND IF THEY FAIL TO DO IT THEN I WILL TAKE EXECUTIVE ACTION. AND SPECIFICALLY WHAT I WILL DO IS PUT IN PLACE A REQUIREMENT THAT FOR ANYONE WHO SELLS MORE THAN FIVE GUNS A YEAR THEY ARE REQUIRED TO DO BACKGROUND CHECKS WHEN THEY SELL THOSE GUNS.
 I WILL REQUIRE THAT FOR ANY GUN DEALER THAT BREAKS THE LAW THE ATF TAKE THEIR LICENSE.
 AND BY THE WAY ATF ALCOHOL TOBACCO AND FIREARMS THEYVE BEEN DOING A LOT OF A ANDTIF WE NEED TO FIX THAT.
 AND THEN ON THE THIRD PIECE BECAUSE NONE OF US HAVE BEEN SLEEPING THE LAST TWO YEARS PART OF WHATS HAPPENED UNDER THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION IS THEY TYKE FUGITIVES OFF THE LIST OF PROHIBITED PEOPLE.
 I PUT THEM BACK ON THE LIST MEANING THAT FUGITIVES FROM JUSTICE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PURCHASE A HANDGUN OR ANY KIND OF WEAPON.
 SO THATS WHAT ID DO.
 WOULD THIS BE YOUR FIRST EXECUTIVE ACTION AS PRESIDENT?
 WELL IT DEPENDS ON WHAT ELSE HAPPENS. AFTER 100 DAYS.
 LETS SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS.
 ALL RIGHT FAIR ENOUGH.
 ANGELA IS A FRESHMAN STUDYING INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS.
 SHE IS FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE. ANGELA?
 GOOD EVENING SENATOR MY QUESTION IS AS A COLLEGE STUDENT WITH OVER 25000 OF DEBT IN MY FIRST YEAR ALONE WHAT WILL YOU DO TO ALLEVIATE THE FINANCIAL BURDENS OF THE STUDENT DEBT CRISIS.
 DO YOU SUPPORT INITIATIVES SUCH AS FREE COLLEGE LOAN PROTECTIVE LEGISLATION OR STUDENT REPAYMENT PLANS?
 YEAH ANGELA. KNOW LISTEN THE STUDENTS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE ARE AMONG THE TOP FIVE IN THE COUNTRY WITH STUDENT LOAN DEBT.
 AND IT IS ABSOLUTELY UNCONSCIONABLE THAT WE HAVE STUDENTS IN AMERICA WHO ARE IN ABSOLUTE FEAR ABOUT THE DEBT THAT THEY WILL OWE UPON GRADUATION.
 AND I HAVE MET AND KNOW SO MANY STUDENTS WHO ARE MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR CAREER BASED ON THEIR FEAR THAT THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PAY THEIR BILLS.
 I KNOW SO MANY STUDENTS WHO HAVE GRADUATED WHO ARE MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TO HAVE A FAMILY BASED ON THE BURDEN OF THEIR STUDENT LOAN DEBT AND BEING CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER THEYRE GOING TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH THE MONTH.
 WE CANNOT AFFORD TO HAVE A SYSTEM LIKE THIS ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE MADE AN INVESTMENT OF THEIR TIME AND THEIR RESOURCES BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY WANT AN EDUCATION TO LIVE A PRODUCTIVE LIFE AND CONTRIBUTE TO OUR SOCIETY AND BE LEADERS.
 HERES WHAT I WOULD DO SPECIFICALLY. I DO SUPPORT DEBT FREE COLLEGE.
 I ALSO BELIEVE THAT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS WE NEED TO ALLOW STUDENTS TO REFINANCE YOUR STUDENT LOAN DEBT AND IN PARTICULAR IM SUPPORTING AN INITIATIVE THAT WOULD ALLOW YOU TO REFINANCE YOUR STUDENT LOAN DEBTING TO BE ON PAR WITH FEDERAL LENDING AMOUNTS.
 FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU PROBABLY NONE OF YOU HERE BUT ANY OF YOUR OLDER BROTHERS AND SISTERS IF YOU TOOK OUT STUDENT LOANS BETWEEN 2006 AND 2013 THE INTEREST RATE WAS ABOUT 7.
 WHAT I AM PROPOSING IS REGARDLESS OF THE INTEREST RATE AT THE TIME THAT YOU TOOK OUT OUR STUDENT LOANS THAT UPON REPAYMENT IT WOULD HAVE TO BE AT THE OTHER THING IS THIS.
 PART OF THE ISSUE IS THAT TERMS OF REPAYMENT THERE IS NO CONNECTION BETWEEN WHAT YOU OWE AND YOUR INCOME.
 WHAT I WOULD BE REQUIRING IS THAT THERE BE A ROBUST PROCESS BY WHICH INCOMEBASED REPAYMENT WOULD BE THE NORM.
 AND FINALLY LETS LOOK AT THE FACT THAT FOR ALL OF YOU AND ALL OF ANYBODY WHO HAS APPLIED FOR FINANCIAL AID THAT IS AN AWFUL PROCESS.
 YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT. ALL THOSE PAGES. YOU CANT BARELY GET THROUGH THAT FORM.
 AND SO PART OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS SIMPLIFY THAT PROCESS.
 BUT WE HAVE GOT TO DO A BETTER JOB IN THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE YOU KNOW I LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE FOR EXAMPLE TEACHERS.
 YOU KNOW IVE BEEN SPENDING A LOT OF TIME I THINK A LOT ABOUT EDUCATION IN TERMS OF EVERY ASPECT OF IT FROM STUDENT LOANS TO WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO PAY OUR TEACHERS THEIR VALUE.
 AND NUMBER OF TEACHERS WHO HAVE LEFT THE PROFESSION OF TEACHING BECAUSE THEY CANT AFFORD TO PAY OFF THEIR STUDENT LOANS RIGHT NOW WERE LOOKING AT ACTUALLY A DEFICIT OF TEACHERS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WE NEED TO ACTUALLY TEACH AND THE FEW TEACHERS WE HAVE ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS ITS A BIG ISSUE AND CROSSES A LOT OF SUBJECTS.
 TEACHERS CANT PAY THEIR LOANS.
 ELIZABETH WARREN IS HERE AS YOU KNOW SHE SAID THAT SHE SUPPORTS STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS FOR 42 MILLION AMERICANS.
 WOULD YOU GO THAT FAR? DO YOU SUPPORT THAT?
 WELL I SUPPORT ANYTHING THAT IS ABOUT REDUCING THE DEBT OF STUDENT LOANS. THATS AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TO HAVE.
 FAIR ENOUGH.
 LETS MOVE ON NOW. RYAN WILSON IS HERE A SOPHOMORE AT HARVARD STUDYING NEUROSCIENCE IN CALIFORNIA AND A SUPPORTER OF JULIAN CASTRO. RYAN.
 HI GOOD EVENING SENATOR HARRIS IM A CONSTITUENT OF YOURS FROM ORANGE COUNTY CALIFORNIA.
 AT JANUARY TOWN HALL WHEN ASKED ABOUT YOUR APPROACH TO UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE YOU ACKNOWLEDGED YOU WOULD SUPPORT HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THE 74 OF AMERICANS WHO WISH TO HAVE THE OPTION TO KEEP THEIR PRIVATE INSURERS?
 WELL I SUPPORT MEDICARE FOR ALL. AND I SUPPORT IT FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS.
 THAT INCLUDE THE FACT THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY WHO SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE BECAUSE THEY CANNOT AFFORD IT AND THATS UNCONSCIONABLE AND I BELIEVE ITS A MORAL ISSUE AND IT IS A SIGN OF WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE GOING TO BE A CIVIL SOCIETY.
 TO DETERMINE ARE PEOPLE GOING TO HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY CAN AFFORD IT WHEN IN FACT THAT SHOULD BE A RIGHT AND NOT A PRIVILEGE OF THE FEW WHO CAN AFFORD IT.
