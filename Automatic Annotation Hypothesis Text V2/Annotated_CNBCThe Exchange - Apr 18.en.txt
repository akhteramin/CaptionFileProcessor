 D.C. AND YOUR MONEY POLITICIANS IN AMERICA WILL DEBATE THE MEANING OF THE MUELLER REPORT WE ASK COULD IT LEAD TO EVEN MORE GRIDLOCK AND STANDSTILL IN D.C. PING AND CONFERENCING ZOOM AND PINTEREST HITTING THE MARKET TO A LOT OF INVESTOR FANFARE.
 COULD THEY SUFFER THE SAME NATURE AS LYFT SHAREHOLDERS A FOLD FAIR A RECYCLEABLE SHOE AND A NEW LEGAL SMOKING AGE.
 THATS WHATS AHEAD ON RAPID FIRE ITS A BIG LEAGUE SHOW LETS START WITH DON CHIAO THE DOW IS UP ALMOST 100 POINT THE.
 AND STABLE RIGHT NOW FOR THE MOST PART.
 IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE MARKETS OVERALL MIXED ONLY BECAUSE THE NASDAQ IS LAGGING.
 THE SP 500 UP BY ABOUT 3 POINTS AND THE DOW INDUSTRIALS JUST ABOUT 100 POINTS TO THE UPSIDE THATS PRETTY DECENT OVERALL WELL SEE IF THAT STICKS ONE PARTICULAR INDUSTRY GROUP TO FOCUS ON THE I SHARES TRACKS THE DOW TRANSPORTS RIGHT NOW AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS WEVE SEEN GOING ALL THE WAY BACK TO DECEMBER THIRD.
 SO TRANSPORT IS A BIG PART OF THAT STORY UNION PACIFIC EARNINGS BETTER THAN EXPECTED.
 THATS DRIVING THE TRADE THERE IF YOURE LOOKING FOR ONE OF THE STOCKS OF THE DAY THATS NOT ZOOM THATS NOT PINTEREST CHECK OUT BLACKSTONE LOOK AT THIS 8 12 GAINS A PRIVATELY TRADED PARTNERSHIP THATS GOING TO BE A PUBLICLY TRADED CORPORATION.
 A LOT MORE INVESTORS COULD COME IN THE MIX AND THEY RAISED A LOT OF MONEY FOR THEIR FUNDS LAST YEAR BACK OVER TO YOU MUCH.
 SIDEWALK BOX TALKING THAT UP THIS MORNING SO AND THE MARKETS THAT DOM JUST WALKED YOU THROUGH HAVE TWO NEW MEMBERS TO WELCOME INTO THE FOLD TODAY YOUVE HEARD THE NAMES PINTEREST AND ZOOM ARE BOTH PUBLIC BOTH RISING.
 JUST ADDING TO THE LIST OF NAMES INCLUDING SOME VERY UNDER THE RADAR ONES THAT HAVE DONE VERY WELL WHEN THEY HIT THE TAPE BOB PA SANI IS AT THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE WITH MORE WHAT A DAY BOTH OF THEM NOT ONLY THE FLOOD GATES HAVE REALLY OPENED NOT OWN BE DO THEY RAISE THE TERMS GOING INTO IT THEY POPPED AT THE OPEN AS WELL LETS TAKE A LOOK HERE PINTEREST PRICE TALK WAS 15 TO 17.
 THEY PRICED IT AT 19 IT OPENED AT 23.75 AND TAKE A LOOK AT IT ON INTRADAY TRADING HERE THEYRE GOING TO TRADE THE WHOLE FLOW TODAY ITS HOLDING UP VERY WELL UP 24.35 ZOOM THOUGH 28 TO 32 JUST FOUR OR FIVE DAYS AGO WE WERE TALKING ABOUT 28 TO 32 FOR ZOOM.
 PRICED AT 36 THATS NOT A TYPO IT OPENED AT 65 THIS IS VERY RARE TO SEE SOMETHING THAT OPENS TWICE AS HIGH AS ANYBODY THOUGHT IT WOULD A WEEK AGO YOU SEE IT TRADING RIGHT HERE AT 63.
 JUST OFF THAT NUMBER ITS PROFITABLE A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE THAT ITS GOT 100 GROWTH AND THOSE ARE THE TWO MAGIC WORDS WE GOT RECENT IPOS THAT JOINS A PARADE THEYVE DONE REALLY WELL LEVI STRAUSS ALL DOING GREAT LYFT IS IT ONE OF THE FEW COMPANIES STILL TO THE DOWN SIDE NO COMPANIES NEXT WEEK BRIAN BUT THE WEEK AFTER WELL GET ANOTHER SLEW MAYBE I HEART MEDIA MAYBE NEXT FRIDAY WELL GET UBER GIVING US SOME TERMS WELL SEE NOT SURE ABOUT THAT YET.
 BOB PA SANI THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW TO WASHINGTON BECAUSE THE OTHER BIG THING TO HIT THE TAPE TODAY WAS THE MUELLER REPORT ITS PERHAPS MORE HEAVILY REDACTED THAN MANY HAD THOUGHT OR HOPED BUT AT 400 OR SO PAGES LONG OUR TEAM IS STILL POURING THROUGH IT MANY EAMON JAVERS STILL TRYING TO DIGEST THAT THE HEADLINE IS OUT THERE THE PRESIDENTS BEEN SAYING THAT THROUGHOUT THE DAY NO COLLUSION NO OBSTRUCTION THATS GOOD NEWS FOR THIS WHITE HOUSE.
 INSIDE THE DOCUMENT WERE FINDING SOME OF THE AREAS OF CONCERN FOR ROBERT MUELLER PARTICULARLY AROUND THE AREA OF POTENTIAL OBSTRUCTION OF THE JUSTICE AND THE PRESIDENTS PUBLIC STATEMENTS HIS TWEETS EVEN ABOUT SOME OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THIS WHOLE SITUATION THOSE WERE RED FLAGS FOR ROBERT MUELLER IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.
 PARTICULARLY ON THIS IDEA OF  ALL RIGHT SO WHEN WE GET EAMON BACK UP SOMEONE PULLED THE PLUG LITERALLY ON EAMON.
 LETS TALK ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE MARKETS AND POLICY GOINGFORWARD.
 LETS BRING IN LIBBY CANTRELL HEAD OF PIMCO.
 THE DEMOCRATS ARE GOING DO COMPLAIN ITS TOO HEAVILY REDACTED WE NEED TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER.
 WHAT DO YOU SEE GOINGFORWARD?
 THIS IS HITTING THROUGH A PARTISAN LENS.
 THE REPUBLICANS ARE SORT 6 CLAIMING VINDICATION HERE THAT THERES NO COLLUSION DEMOCRATS MAY WALKTHROUGH THE DOOR THAT THE MUELLER REPORT OPENED IN TERMS OF INVESTIGATING FURTHER WHETHER THERE IS OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.
 I THINK YOULL HEAR LOUDER CALLS FOR IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS FROM THE LEFT SPEAKER PELOSI WILL DO EVERYTHING SHE CAN TO NOT HEED THOSE CALLS.
 WASHINGTON IS WEATHER POLARIZED ALREADY PARTISAN THERE WAS NOT LEEWAY ANYWAY.
 THE BIG THINGS THAT PRESIDENT INTERRUPT WANTS TO MOVE LEGISLATIVELY IS NAFTA 2.0 THAT MIGHT BE HARDER TO MOVE NOW WITH A MORE FRACTURED RELATIONSHIP DO YOU BELIEVE THAT RON TO LIBBYS POINT THAT IN SOME WAYS WILL AFFECT WHAT SHOULD BE BIPARTISAN OR NONPARTISAN.
 PURELY ECONOMIC NEGOTIATIONS YEAH I DONT THINK THERES ANY ESCAPING MAYBE THE OVERHANG THAT LIBBY ALLUDED TO. WITHIN THE OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE COMPONENT OF THIS REPORT BOB MUELLER EFFECTIVELY PUNTED TO CON AND SUGGESTED IN THE ABSENCE OF HIS BEING ABLE TO DO ANYTHING WHICH SAYS YOU CANNOT INDICT A SITTING PRESIDENT HE REALLY SUGGESTED THAT CONGRESS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT TAKE THIS UP TO THE EXTENT THEYRE DISTRACTED OR OBSESSED BY THIS IT WILL SLOW DOWN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND CREATE EVEN MORE FRACTURES BETWEEN THE DEMOCRATS AND THE HOUSE AND THE WHITE HOUSE ITSELF YOU KNOW JOHN WHEN BARRS LETTER CAME OUT PEOPLE SAID OKAY THIS IS OVER IT APPEARS THAT RON IS SUGGESTING MAYBE WE ARE JUST GETTING STARTED ON A SECOND PHASE OF THIS.
 WELL I THINK THATS BECAUSE BARRS LETTER WAS SUCH A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THIS AND THE REPORT TODAY GIVES US A LOT MORE DETAIL AS EAMON WAS SAYING BEFORE SOMEBODY PULLED THE PLUG THAT A LOT OF DETAIL ABOUT THE POTENTIAL OBSTRUCTION THAT THE PRESIDENT HAD ENGAGED IN ORDERS TO DON McGANN THEN THE WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL TO DIRECT ROD ROSENSTEIN TO FIRE ROBERT MUELLER THE SPECIAL COUNSEL McGANN REFUSING OFFERING HIS RESIGNATION AND ULTIMATELY STAYING ON A WHILE LONGER AND TELLING AIDS THAT TRUMP HAD ASKED HIM TO DO CRAZY STUFF.
 I THINK ALL OF THAT AND TO LIBBYS POINT EARLIER I THINK IT WAS THE RIGHT ONE I BELIEVE THAT THE WAY THE ADMINISTRATION THROUGH BILL BARR IN THE LETTER AND TODAYS PRESS CONFERENCE IN WHICH HE SEEMED TO BE SPINNING FOR THE PRESIDENT TO BLUNT THE IMPACT OF THE REPORT I THINK THATS GOING TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR SPEAKER PELOSI TO RESIST THOSE IN HER CAUCUS WHO INSIST ON AN IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDING TO WEIGH THIS IN A WAY THAT THEY THINK IS SEARCHING AND FAIR.
 YEAH AND EAMON JAVERS IS ALIVE AND WELL HE IS BACK WITH US SOMEONE PULLED THE PLUG BUT NOT ON HIM LITERALLY.
 NO CENSORSHIP HERE.
 HES NOT REDACTED YOUVE BEEN THERE DAY IN AND DAY OUT FOR US YOUVE SEEN THE BACK AND FORTH INSIDE THE SPEAKERS CHAMBER AND TALKING ABOUT THIS WITH SARAH SANDERS ONE WONDERS HOW MUCH MORE OF ANY DIALOGUE THAT WE HAVE IS SIMPLY GOING TO BE ABOUT THE REPORT FROM NOW ON THE ADMINISTRATION CAN TALK ABOUT DEFENSE SPENDING OR INFRASTRUCTURE OR IMMIGRATION WHATEVER IT IS AND EVERY QUESTION IS GOING TO GO BACK TO THIS REPORT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MAYBE YOURS WELL YOU KNOW THATS RIGHT I MEAN FIRST OF ALL THIS IS A WHITE HOUSE THAT DOESNT BRIEF THE PRESS ANY MORE THEYRE NOT GOING TO FACE THIS TELEADVISED SPECTACLE OF THE WHITE HOUSE TRYING TO GET OUT THE LINE OF THE DAY.
 YOURE GOING TO SEE THE PRESIDENT LEAVING HERE SHORTLY THIS AFTERNOON IN A COUPLE HOURS AND REPORTERS WILL ASK HIM QUESTIONS.
 I EXPECT HE WILL TALK HES BEEN TWEETING VIGOROUSLY TODAY HE HAS A LOT TO SAY ABOUT THIS.
 I EXPECT WERE GOING TO GET LENGTHY COMMENTS FROM THE PRESIDENT HERE I DONT GET THE SENSE THEYRE GOING TO REBUT MUCH OF THIS AT ALL.
 THEYRE GOING TO LET THIS SIT AND RETREAT TO THE HEADLINE OF NO OBSTRUCTION NO COLLUSION AND ON THE SMALLER THINGS LET ALL THAT GO.
 THERES SOME STUFF IN HERE ABOUT SARAH SANDERS AND HOW SHE RESPONDED TO THE COMEY FIRING BY SUGGESTING FBI AGENTS INSIDE THE BUREAU HAD LOST CONFIDENCE IN COMEY AND THEY HAD HEARD FROM COUNTLESS MEMBERS OF THE FBI WHO SAID THEY DIDNT LIKE COMEY IN HER INTERVIEW WITH THE SPECIAL COUNSELS TEAM SHE ADMITTED THAT DIDNT HAVE ANY BASIS IN FACT AND IT WAS A SLIP OF THE TONGUE OR SHE JUST KIND OF SAID IT AT THE TIME AND DIDNT REALLY BASE IT ON ANY FACTUAL BASIS.
 YOU KNOW THOSE SMALLER THINGS DOESNT SEEM LIKE THE WHITE HOUSE IS GOING TO ADDRESS AT ALL THEY MAY JUST LET THEM ALL GO THEYRE CONTENT WITH THE WIN HERE AND THEY FEEL LIKE THEYVE HAD A BIG POSITIVE POLITICAL DAY.
 IM NOT SURE HOW MUCH OF A WIN THERE IS I GOT THROUGH THE FIRST 50 PAGES OF THE REPORT THERES SOME MATERIALALITY WHEN IT COMES TO WHETHER OR NOT THE CAMPAIGN EXPECTED TO BENEFIT FROM RUSSIAS ACTIONS AND INTERFERING.
 NOT RISING TO THE LEVEL OF CRIMINALITY.
 BUT FROM A MARKET PERSPECTIVE THIS MAY IN MANY WAYS TURN NEUTRAL IN SO FAR AS WERE SEEING A RESYNCHRONIZATION OF CHINESE AND AMERICAN ECONOMIC GROWTH EUROPES THE OUTLIER AT THE MOMENT WERE SEEING THE FED BACK OFF AND CENTRAL BANKS START TO STIMULATE IF TODAYS RETAIL SALES NUMBER WERE ANY INDICATION OF WHERE WERE GOING FROM HERE THE MARKET MAY RETURN THE ATTENTION TO FUNDAMENTALS AND MAYBE IGNORE DAMAGE YOU FOR BRING IF RIGHT BACK DOWN THE CNBC LANE.
 ITS AMAZING THE RETAIL SALES NUMBER BETTER THAN EXPECTED.
 JOBLESS CLAIMS UNDER 200000 GDP REVISIONS ARE GOING UP AT GOLDMAN SACHS AND OTHERS ITS AMAZING THAT THIS IS GETTING ALL THE HEADLINES AND IF YOU JUST FOCUSED ON THIS YOU WOULD THINK THIS IS THE ONLY THING HAPPENING OUTSIDE OF THIS AMERICA ROLLS ON AND THE ECONOMY ROLLS ON AND THE PRESIDENT WILL HAVE A STRONG ECONOMY MOST LIKELY BEHIND HIM IN THAT REELECTION BID.
 MOST LIKELY AND OUR VIEW OF PIMCO IS THAT WELL SEE 2 2 12 GROWTH HERE IN THE UNITED STATES YOU HAVE THE EFFECT OF FADING FISCAL STIMULUS AND YOU HAVE A BIG IMPULSE FROM THE TAX BILL THAT WAS PASSED IN LATE 2017 AND A BIG SPENDING BILL THAT WAS PASSED IN 2018 ANOTHER AREA OF THIS MUELLER REPORT THAT COULD INFORM RELATIONS WITH CORNING THAT COULD BE RELEVANT IS THIS IDEA OF THE FISCAL CLIFF OF THE MARKETS ARE NOT FOCUSED ON THIS RIGHT NOW THATS BECAUSE IF COULDNT DOESNT STEP IN AND KEEP SPENDING LEVELS AT THE RATE THEY ARE NOW COME JANUARY 1st OF 2020 WE COULD SEE A HALF A PERCENT HEAD WIND OF ECONOMIC GROWTH BECAUSE OF THIS BIG DRIVEDOWN IN SPENDING.
 I THINK WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT CONGRESS IS EXPEDIENT.
 THEYRE NOT GOING TO WANT TO DO THAT GOING INTO  THEY MAY WANT TO DO THAT.
 JOHN HARWOOD.
 I WANTED TO MAKE ONE POINT WHICH IS THAT IN TERMS OF THE EFFECT ON THE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA THERE REALLY ISNT MUCH OF A LEGISLATIVE AGENDA IN THEORY THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS AN INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN BUT REPUBLICAN LEADERS IN CONGRESS DONT AND THE KIND OF PLAN THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS IS NOT WHAT DEMOCRATS WANT SO OTHER THAN THE USMCA WHICH IS SIGNIFICANT THERE ISNT MUCH THAT CONGRESS MIGHT DO IN THE ABSENCE OF THIS MUELLER REPORT I THINK THATS IMPORTANT AND ALSO  LET ME ASK YOU LIBBYS POINT IF I CAN WERE RUNNING OUT OF TIME DO YOU BELIEVE ITS NOT ONLY BECAUSE THE REPORT BUT MAYBE THE REPORT LAYERS ON THAT THE U.S. CONGRESS DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS BOTH WILL PLAY ECONOMIC CHICKEN WITH THE FISCAL CLIFF AND THE U.S. ECONOMY I DOUBT IT.
 I DONT THINK DEMOCRATS APPROACH THESE ISSUES DIFFERENTLY FROM REPUBLICANS AND WHILE THEYLL FIGHT FOR THEIR POLICY PRIORITIES I DONT THINK THAT A NANCY PELOSI LED HOUSE WOULD ENGAGE IN THE DEGREE OF BRINKS MANSHIP WEVE SEEN IN THE PAST LETS HOPE.
 535 MEN AND WOMEN FIGHTING WHILE OTHERS MAY SUFFER.
 EAMON JAVERS GOOD TO SEE YOU ARE WELL WERE JUST GETTING STARTED ON THE EXCHANGE HERES WHAT ELSE IS COMING UP.

 Better Life.i HNCHS SO MUCH TALK ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN ITS IMPORTANT TO LOOK YOJD THE GOVERNMENT DATA LETS DO MORE OF THAT BY DIVING INTO BB  TS LATEST QUARTER KELLY ITS GREAT TO HAVE YOU ON THE PROGRAM SO MUCH DISCUSSION ABOUT A POSSIBILITY OF A SLOWDOWN HOW IS BB  T SEEING LOAN DEMAND GLAD TO BE BACK LOAN DEMAND IS ACTUALLY VERY GOOD ACTUALLY PRODUCTION IS VERY HIGH. OUR PIPELINE WHERE WE MEASURE ALL THE APPLICATIONS AND PROCESS ARE AT AN ALL TIME HIGH. AND SO WERE SEEING A BROAD BASE LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE A BROAD BASED LEVEL OF WILLINGNESS TO BORROW MONEY TO INVEST AND PLANTING CAPITAL AND EQUIPMENT OVERALL ITS VERY GOOD ON THE STREET DOESNT MATCH UP WITH THE NATIONAL RHETORIC YOU HEAR IN YOUR EXPERIENCE YOUR LONG HISTORY OF RUNNING A BANK TO PEOPLE BORROW MONEY DO BUSINESSES BORROW MONEY WHEN THEY SENSE A SLOWDOWN IS IMMINENT THEY DO BRIAN. ITS INTERESTING THEY DO YEAH THEY DO I TRAVEL AROUND AND TALK TO LOTS OF BUSINESS PEOPLE ONE ON ONE AND SO WHEN I TALK TO THEM THEY TALK ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS.
 THEYRE CHATTING ABOUT THE NATIONAL ISSUES.
 WHEN YOU GET RIGHT DOWN TO WHAT THEYRE GOING TO DO THEY FOCUS ON THEIR BUSINESS.
 SO IF THEIR ACTUAL MARKET IS SLOWING DOWN THEY WILL REDUCE THEIR INVESTMENT BUT IF ITS JUST A LOT OF A GENERAL CONVERSATION THEYLL TALK ABOUT IT.
 MIGHT CAUSE THEM EASINESS.
 THEYLL FOCUS ON RUNNING THEIR BUSINESS FORRAL THE NUMBERS THE QUARTER AND THE YEAR SO FAR DO YOU BELIEVE WE WILL BE IN A RECESSION IN 12 TO 18 MONTHS YOU KNOW I ACTUALLY DO NOT ILL BE HONEST 6 OR 8 9 MONTHS AGO I WAS A LITTLE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF THAT.
 THERE WAS SO MUCH RHETORIC ABOUT TEN YEARS AFTER A WHILE EVERYBODY BEGINS TO HAVE THAT EFFECT BUT AS IVE GOTTEN AROUND AND TALKED TO BUSINESS PEOPLE AS I SEE THE STRENGTH JUST WHAT YOUVE BEEN REPORTING IN THE LAST HOUR OR SO.
 STRONG RETAIL SALES LOW UNEMPLOYMENT LOW JOBLESS CLAIMS NO MAJOR GEO POLITICAL RISK THAT SEEMS TO BE EMINENTLY PROBLEMATIC I DONT SEE AND CERTAINLY IN THOSE 12 TO 18 MONTHS I DO NOT SEE AN IMMINENT SLOWDOWN I THINK THAT YOU COULD HAVE SOME EXISTENTIAL FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE THAT I DONT THINK ITS PREDICTABLE AT THIS HAD TIME ONE THING THAT STOOD OUT TO ME IT WAS A LITTLE SHOCKING I GUESS YOUR NET INTEREST MARGIN ROSE ONLY TWO BIPS LITERALLY. A TINY PERCENT WELL TAKE WHAT WE CAN GET. IT ROSE EVEN AS INTEREST RATE S LOWERED.
 HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?
 REAR A REALLY BIG COMMUNITY BANK WE OPERATE OUR REGIONAL BANK STRUCTURE WERE IN A LOT OF RURAL AREAS METRO URBAN AREAS AS WELL. WE HAVE A LOT OF STABLE DEPOSITS THEYRE MORE FOCUSED ON RELATIONSHIPS A LOT OF SMALL BUSINESS CLIENTS AND SO IT OUR NIM PRESSURE IS MORE A FUNCTION OF WHATS HAPPENING IN OUR LOCAL MARKETS THAN IT IS IN THE NATIONAL MARKETS. WHEN YOU HEAR A LOT OF NATIONAL DISCUSSION ABOUT CHANGES IN NIM IT DOESNT INHERENTLY AFFECT US. IF WE DO SOME EXTERNAL LARGE FUNDING THAT WILL MOVE OUR NIM AROUND A LITTLE BIT BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR QUARTER WHAT WE REALLY SAW WAS THAT OUR FUNDING WAS INCREASING BUT OUR RATE OF RETURN ON ASSETS WAS INCREASING AT A FASTER RATE YOU KNOW ONE QUICK LAST QUESTION YOURE PAYING AN ADVERTISING AGENCY A LOT OF MONEY TO COME UP WITH A NEW BRAND BETWEEN SUN TRUST AND BB  T WHEN YOU MERGE. CAN YOU GIVE US A HINT AS TO WHAT THATS SHAPING UP TO BE SUN TRUST AND BB  T COULD MORE TOGETHER LIKE A KIDS DRINK IF YOURE NOT CAREFUL THE REASON WE DECIDED TO PICK A NEW NAME VERSUS USING EITHER ONE OF THE OTHERS OUR MERGER IS ABOUT IMPROVING PROFITABILITY WHICH IT DOES ENORMOUSLY ITS ABOUT LINING FORWARD MAJOR INVESTMENTS AND INNOVATION TECHNOLOGY ITS ABOUT GETTING EXCITING ABOUT MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE CLIENTS IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY AND TRUST KIND OF THAT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TECHNOLOGY AND BRANCHS AND SO WE WANT TO NAME THE POINTS FORWARD THAT EXCITES OUR CLIENTS OUR ASSOCIATES AND THE MARKET IN GENERAL TO SAY THIS IS AN INSTITUTION THAT IS MOVING FORWARD IS ENERGIZED AND TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE AND CLIENTS IN PARTICULAR WE THINK WE CAN FIND SUCH A NAME GOOD LUCK WE DO WISH YOU LUCK APPRECIATE THAT HAVE A GOOD EASTER THANK YOU.
