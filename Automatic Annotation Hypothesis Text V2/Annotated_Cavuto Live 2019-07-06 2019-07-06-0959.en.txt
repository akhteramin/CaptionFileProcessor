CALIFORNIA BRACING WITH A SECOND EARTHQUAKE STRIKING FOUNDATIONS OF ROADS CRACKING AND NOW THE FEAR ANOTHER ONE COULD BE COMING AS CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM DECLARES A STATE OF EMERGENCY IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY. WELCOME HAPPY WEEKEND I AM NEO AND YOU ARE LOOKING AT LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT WHERE ALL IS CALM AFTER RIDGECREST CALIFORNIA WHERE THE FIRST EPICENTER THAT IS WHERE YOULL FIND JEFF IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL. HOW ARE THINGS THERE NOW? Reporter THERES A GENERAL FEELING OF UNEASINESS TWO DAYS TWO BIG MASSIVE EARTHQUAKES NEAR THIS TOWN IN CALIFORNIA AND THIS LATEST ONE SEVERAL AFTERSHOCKS IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES OR SO WHEN WE WERE WAITING TO SPEAK WITH YOU WE FELT SEVERAL OF THEM AT CITY HALL AND THAT UNEASINESS IS LEADING MANY PEOPLE NOT WANTING TO LEAP SLEEP INSIDE THEIR HOUSE LASTLY.
 WE CAUGHT UP WITH THE SHERIFFS DEPUTY GOING STREET TO STREET TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE WERE OKAY. HE SAW A LOT OF PEOPLE LIVING OUTSIDE OR COMING HERE TO CITY HALL WHERE THERE IS A SHELTER SET UP.
 MAYBE WE COULD PULL UP THE ACTUAL SOUND ON THIS. THIS IS THE MOMENT WE WERE AT A RESTAURANT STARTED TO FEEL THE RUMBLING THE VIOLENT SHAKING AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT.
 TAKE A LISTEN. YOU COULD REALLC IN PEOPLES VOICES.
 THIS WAS A RESTAURANT RIGHT HERE IN RIDGECREST AND T WAS A SLIGHT AFTERSHOCK BEFORE THIS AND EVERY ONE THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH A FEW IN THE LAST DAY BUT THE 7.1 THE WHOLE BUILDING WAS SHAKING DISHES CRASHING ON THE GROUND AND YOU COULD SEE PEOPLE IN DISBELIEF SOME HITTING THE GROUND IN TEARS AND SHORTLY AFTER WALKING OUT OF THIS RESTAURANT WE LOOKED INTO THE DISTANCE AND WE SEE A HUGE PLUME OF SMOKE WE GET CLOSER AND REALIZE THIS HOUSE IS ON FIRE AND THIS IS AT LEAST ONE HOUSE THAT WAS SET ON FIRE A LOT OF THESE FRTED BECAUSE OF RUPTURED GAS LINES. WE ARE HAVING BRIEFINGS ALL NIGHT CREWS AROUND THE OPERATIONS CENTER. NOT THAT UNCOMMON IF YOU TALK TO THE GEOLOGISTS.
 WE ARE ONLY HEARING OF SOME MINOR INJURIES AND THINGS FALLING ON PEOPLE REPORTS OF ANY DEPTH BUT THE GOVERNOR HAS DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY HAS REQUESTED A PRESIDENTIAL DECLARATION HELP FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THAT HAS EVERYONE ON TENTERHOOKS. WE HAVE SERIOUS INJURIES THERE ARE SOME BUT HOW MUCH HOW SERIOUS THE INJURIES THEY ARE HOSPITALS HAVE BEEN EVACUATED IN SOME OF THE POWER LINES AND GAS LINES HAVE BEEN BROKEN SO WE NEED TO GET IN AND FIND OUT WHAT WE ARE DEALING WITH.
 SO FAR THE PRESIDENT HASNT TWEETED ABOUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN CALIFORNIA. WHAT KIND OF MORE DOES THAT MEAN? HOW MUCH MORE? WE HAVE BEEN WORKING OVERNIGHT SINCE THE SECOND EARTHQUAKE HAPPENED YESTERDAY EVENING. THESE AFTERSHOCKS ARE MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN THE MENT BY A FACTOR OF 10 TIMES AND IM WONDERING HOW UNUSUAL IS THAT FOR IANS WHO ARE ALWAYSACED FO THIS KIND OF STUFF?  WILL DEFER TO THE GEOLOGISTS WE HAVE BEEN TALKING TO FOR THE PAST 48 HOURS. NOW IS 7.1.
 CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM HAS DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY FOR AT LEAST SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY AND BRACING FOR MORE. ON THE PHONE WITH US IS PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER FROM THE GOVERNORS OFFICE AND EMERGENCY SERVICE THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME. HOW ARE THINGS LOOKING? NOT THAT UNCOMMON AND WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS THE INITIAL EARTHQUAKE WE SAW WAS NOT CONSIDERED A MAIN EARTHQUAKE THE BIGGER THE EARTHQUAKE THAT BECOMES THE MAIN ONE.
 THE SECOND EARTHQUAKE HAPPENED RIGHT BEFORE SUNSET DARKNESS PREVENTED US FROM DOING A LOT. HOW WIDESPREAD IS THAT?
 WE JUST HAD SUNRISE IN CALIFORNIA IN THE LAST HOUR SO IT IS CRUCIAL FOR US GETTING INTO RIDGECREST AND AFFECTED AREAS TO SEE WHAT DAMAGE WE ARE TALKING ABD THERE ARE SOME INJURIES BUT WE DONT KNOW HOW MUCH ANARD INSIDE THEIR HOMES.NT TO GO WE NEE WHAT NEEDS THEY CAVUTO WE HAVE NOT HEARD REPORTS OF SIGNIFICANT INJURIES. IT HAPPENED YESTERDAY EVENING THAT WAS THE MAIN EARTHQUAKE AND THE ONE ON THE FOURTH OF JULY IS BEING CALLED A 4 SHOCK. NEIL WE GET ANECDOTAL REPORTS A PEOPLE AFRAID TO SLEEP IN THEIR HOME SO THEY ARE IN THEIR DRIVEWAY OR SLEEPING OUTSIDE THEY ARE THAT ANXIOUS.
 I HAVENT BEEN IN RIDGECREST BUT I DONT BLAME THEM. IT HAS BEEN 48 HOURS IN THE SHAKING HAS BEEN VERY VIOLENT AT TIMES AND PEOPLE WANT TO BE OUTSIDE TO FEEL A LITTLE SAFER AND THE PROBLEM IS WHAT WE HAVE EARTHQUAKES IS CANT PREDICT WHEN THE NEXT ONE WILL HAPPEN.
 YOU CAN TRY TO GIVE ADVANCED WARNING BUT EVEN SECONDS IS A GOOD MORNING. IF THERES A TRAIN RUNNING THROUGH THE AREA WE STOP ELEVATORS BUTT HAVE A SYSTEM THAT CAN PREDICT FROM MINUTES AWAY WHEN SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN. NEIL YOUVE HAD LITTLE IF ANY SLEEP SO WE APPRECIATE YOU UPDATING US.
 THE GOVERNORS OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES THE PRESIDENT WAS BRIEFED ON THIS. THIS MORNING UPDATES ON THAT 7.1 MAGNITUDE EARTHQUAKE. THE PERMIT OF LABOR SAYS US ECONOMY ADDED 20000 JOBS IN JUNE THAT IS UP FROM 72000 IN MAY. OUR COUNTRY CONTINUES TO DO REALLY WELL REALLY REALLY WELL. GOING TO BE BREAKING RECORDS. Reporter DONALD TRUMP CONTINUES CRITIQUES OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE ON TWITTER WRITING OTHER COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD ARE DOING ANYTHING POSSIBLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES KNOWING OUR FEDERAL RESERVE DOES NOT HAVE A CLUE.
 ALLISON BARBER IS WITH THE PRESIDENT WHERE THE COMMANDERINCHIEF IS SPENDING THE WEEKEND. THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS DONALD TRUMP WAS BRIEFED ON THE LATEST EARTHQUAKE IN CALIFORNIA OVERNIGHT AROUND 100 AM THE WHITE HOUSE SAID THEY HAD TEAMS CLOSELY MONITORING THE SITUATION IN CALIFORNIA SO THEY WOULD BE PROVIDING UPDATES TO THE PRESIDENT THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT DONALD TRUMP IS IN NEW JERSEY STAYING AT A GOLF CLUB IN THAT MINSTER AND AS OF THIS MORNING TWEETING ABOUT IMMIGRATION JOE BIDEN AND THE ECONOMY. WE ARE VERY HAPPY ABOUT IT. AGGRESSIVELY CRITICIZED D REPEATEDLY GONE AFTER THE FED AND THE CHAIRMAN.
 TO LOWER INTEREST RATES IT WOULD BE LIKE A ROCKETSHIP.
 HE CRITICIZED THE FED FOR RAISING RATES NOT DOING ENOUGH TO HELP THE US ECONOMY JAY POWELL HAS EMPHASIZED THE FED IS INDEPENDENT AND WHEN ASKED ABOUT DONALD TRUMP REPORTED THE FED WOULD NEVER TAKE POLITICAL CONSIDERATION INTO ACCOUNT OR DISCUSS THEM AS PART OF THEIR WORK. HE SAID THEIR PRIORITY WAS WORKING FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
 WITH THE PRESIDENT IN NEW JERSEY. WITH A STRONG JOBS REPORT IT IS TOUGH TO MAKE THE CASE THAT THE ECONOMY IS JUST TANKING.
 WHAT DO DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES DO? That Karl brought his karaoke machine?  Aint nothing but a heartache...  No I cant believe how easy it was to save hundreds of dollars on my car insurance with GEICO.
  I never wanna hear you say...  No Kevin... no Kevin! Believe it! GEICO could save you fifteen percent or more on car insurance.
 GEICO could save you fifteen percent My mom washes the dishes... ...before she puts them in the dishwasher.
 So what does the dishwasher do? i Cascade Platinum.i When I book at Hilton.com I get to select my room from the floor plan... Free WiFi... ...and the Price MSo with Hilton. tho catch.
 i Cascade Platinum does the worki i for youi iprewashing and removingi istuckon foodsi i the first time.i Wow thats clean!
 Yeah the only catch is Im never leaving.
 No Im serious I live here now. i Book at Hilton.comi and get the Hilton i Price Match Guarantee.i OUR ECONOMY MUCH BETTER THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN.
 FROM ELECTION DAY 50 INCREASE AND WE PAID TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
 NEIL A 50 INCREASE THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL SURGING SINCE HE WAS FIRST ELECTED THE PRESIDENT SAYING HE IS A BIG REASON FOR THAT AND OPTIMISM AHEAD OF HIS INAUGURATION AND WHAT HE HAS DONE SINCE HAVE MADE THE CHANGES AND BOOMING JOBS REPORT FEW PEOPLE SAW COMING.
 2020 DEMOCRATS PORTRAYING AN ECONOMY NOT NEARLY AS ROBUST AS THE NUMBERS INDICATE LAUREN LEADER IT IS WITH US JOSEPH PINION AND HOST OF FOX NATION BEGIN WITH WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS SAYING DENYING THE NUMBERS CREDIT FOR THOSE NUMBERS.
 THAT IS THE SECOND PART A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH. THE ECONOMY IS DOING VERY WELL THAT IS OBJECTIVELY TRUE AND WELL THE ECONOMY IS DOING SO IF ANY OTHER PRESIDENT IT WOULD BE AND IT HAS BEEN.
 WE DONT KNOW HOW MUCH IT WILL AFFECT COMMAND AT THE SAME TIME POLLS HAVENT ALWAYS ACCURATELY REPRESENTED HOW MUCH SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT HAS IF YOU LOOK AT 2016.
 IT IS HARD TO SAY BUT IT WILL BE HARD FOR THE DEMOCRATS BECAUSE THEY CANT SAY THE ECONOMY IS A DISASTER HARD TO ARGUE AGAINST SOMETHING THAT IS DOING SO WELL. NEIL YOU CANT SAY THE ECONOMY GALLUP POLL TAKEN A COUPLE WEEKS AGO COMPARED TO A YEAR AGO WHICH IS INDEPENDENT OF POLITICAL QUESTIONS BUT HOW DO YOU VIEW THE ECONOMY. 46 OF AMERICANS THINK THE ECONOMY IS POOR OR VERY BAD AND THAT IS THE SAME NUMBER IT WAS A YEAR AGO.
 NEIL HOW WAS UNDER BARACK OBAMA? I DIDNT LOOK AT EVERY SINGLE YEAR. IT WAS A DIFFERENT TIME BECAUSE WE WERE STILL COMING OUT OF RECESSION. THE IMPACT OF THE TARIFFS ON FARMERS IN THE MIDWEST ONGOING TRADE GROWTH IS BEGINNING TO CHANGE STARTING TO RISE SLIGHTLY. DEMOCRATS WILL SAY OF THE ECONOMY SO GOOD WHY ARENT WE INVESTING IN THE WORKING CLASS TO RDEBT TALK ABOUT TRILLIONS  NEIL LIKE ME GIVING DIETARY ADVICE. THE DEBT HAS EXPLODED UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION. NEIL UNDER THE PRIOR ONE. ONE OF THE THINGS THE PRESIDENT HASNT BEEN ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE POINTS THAT WERE RAISED THERE WERE 1 MILLION MORE AFRICANAMERICANS EMPLOYED THAN WHEN BARACK OBAM LEFT OFFICE. WITH THOSE GROUPS HE IS STILL UNDERWATER. WHY IS THAT? THE DIFFERENCES THOSE TWO OR THREE JOBS ARE PAYING MORE UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION.
 THE POINT IS THE PRESIDENT IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE A BETTER PICTURE. VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICANS COULDNT MANAGE A 200 UNEXPECTED MEDICAL  NEIL THAT HAS BEEN THE CASE ARE DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTS. MESSAGING ACROSS THE BOARD THEY ARE BETTER SERVED NOT TALKING ABOUT HISPANIC IMPLEMENT A BLACK UNEMPLOYMENT BUT WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH POVERTY.
 HAVING SAID THAT IF DEMOCRATS TELL YOU PEOPLE ING TWO WITH THREE JOBS THEY HAVE BEEN THIS WHOLE TIME.
 NEIL PEOPLE WORKING TWO OR MORE JOBS A HARD NUMBER NEVERTHELESS BUT EVERYBODY IS WORKING.
 WAGE GROWTH IS TAKING UP AS JOB GROWTH IS TICKING UP.
 WAGE GROWTH FOR AFRICANAMERICANS AND HISPANICS HAS NO NEIL IT HAS BEENAEEEEEEE TO 3.
