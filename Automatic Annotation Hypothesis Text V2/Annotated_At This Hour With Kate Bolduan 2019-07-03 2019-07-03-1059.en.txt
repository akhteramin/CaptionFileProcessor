 NICK WHATS THE LATEST?
 Reporter WELL ITS A BIT OF BREAKING NEWS THIS MORNING.
 WERE HEARING FROM ACTING DHS SECRETARY ABOUT THOSE SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS.
 REMEMBER EARLIER THIS WEEK KATE WE REPORTED ABOUT THIS CLOSED FACEBOOK GROUP THAT FEATURED CURRENT AND FORMER THEY SAY BORDER PATROL AGENTS MAKING LEWD COMMENTS DEROGATORY COMMENTS RACIALLY INFLAMMATORY COMMENTS JOKING ABOUT DEAD MIGRANTS.
 NOW THE ACTING DHS SECRETARY TWEETING THIS THIS MORNING.
 I HAVE DIRECTED AN IMMEDIATE INVESTIGATION AND AS THE U.S. BORDER PATROL CHIEF HAS MADE CLEAR ANY EMPLOYEE FOUND TO HAVE COMPROMISED THE PUBLICS TRUST WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.
 WHATS UNCLEAR AT THIS MOMENT WE WERE UNDER THE UNDERSTANDING THAT EARLIER THIS WEEK AN INVESTIGATION HAD ALREADY BEEN UNDER WAY.
 THE POSTS WERE SAID TO HAVE BEEN TURNED OVER TO INTERNAL AFFAIRS AT CBP.
 THE DHS INSPECTOR GENERAL IS ALSO SAID TO HAVE GOTTEN THEIR HANDS ON THESE SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS.
 A BROADER QUESTION WERE ALSO WONDERING IF HES CALLING FOR AN INVESTIGATION INTO THESE SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS.
 WHEN WILL HE CALL FOR AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CONDITIONS IN THESE BORDER PATROL FACILITIES?
 SPEAKING ON THAT IT WAS YESTERDAY THAT I SPOKE TO A LONGTIME VETERAN EL PASO BORDER PATROL AGENT WHO SAID THEYRE TIRED OF SEEING THE CONDITIONS MIGRANTS ARE BEING HELD IN AND DECIDED TO SPEAK OUT SO LONG AS WE CONCEALED THEIR IDENTITY.
 YOURE TAKING A BIG RISK BY DOING THIS.
 YES BUT AMERICA NEEDS TO KNOW.
 THEY NEED TO KNOW THE TRUTH.
 Reporter A BORDER PATROL AGENT WHOS HAD ENOUGH.
 IN A CNN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW THE VETERAN AGENT WHO AGREED TO GO ON CAMERA ONLY IF THEIR IDENTITY WAS CONCEALED GROUP REPORTEDLY ATB CLOSED COMPRISED OF THOUSANDS OF CURRENT AND FORMER AGENTS.
 PRO PUBLICA THE FIRST TO EXPOSE THE GROUP WHERE MEMBERS SHARED LEWD AND SEXIST CONTENT ABOUT LATINA MEMBERS OF CONGRESS INCLUDING ALEXANDRIA OCASIOCORTEZ.
 THE AGENT TELLING CNN BEING DEROGATORY IS PART OF THE BORDER PATROL CULTURE EVEN HEARING A SUPERVISOR JOKE ABOUT DEAD MIGRANTS.
 HE WAS MAKING FUN OF THEM.
 SAYING WHAT?
 THAT WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE M MAKE ITS JUST ANOTHER LIFE?
 HE MADE A COMMENT ALSO REGARDING RUNNING OVER ILLEGALS. IM LIKE YOU CANNOT RUN OVER PEOPLE.
 Reporter IN DESCRIBING THE CONDITIONS INSIDE THE EL PASO DETENTION FACILITIES THE AGENT COMPARED THEM TO A ZOO.
 THE HOLDING FACILITY THE CELLS THEY ARE WHAT I WILL SAY FILTHY.
 WE HAVE A MAINTENANCE AND CLEANING CREW THAT CLEAN THE GENERAL AREA LIKE THE HALLWAYS BUT I HAVE NEVER SEEN THEM CLEANING COUNTERS OR CLEANING TOILETS IN THE CELLS OR CLEANING SINKS IN THE CELL.
 SOMETIMES YOU GO IN A CELL AND THERES TRASH EVERYWHERE.
 THERE AREHOSE IN LEADERSHIP OF CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION THEY SAY THAT MIGRANTS ARE GETTING BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS.
 WHAT DO YOU SAY TO LEADERS WHO SAY THAT?
 Reporter WHAT IS BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS TOILET PAPER?
 WATER FROM THE SINK?
 OR IN THE SAME CLOTHING FOR DAYS.
 I REMEMBER WHEN THERE USED T AhCESSING CENTER. ESPECIALLY IN WINTER WE USED TO HAVE THESE BLANKETS. TEN DIFFERENT ALIENS WOULD USE THE SAME BLANKET.
 WE WOULD RECYCLE THEM.
 WELL PUT THEM IN A BAG AND THEY WOULDNT GET WASHED.
 I FEEL LIKE YOU KNOW MULTIPLE TIMES DURING OUR INTERVIEW YOUVE SORT OF STARED OFF IN THE DISTANCE AND THOUGHT ABOUT SOME THINGS YOUVE SEEN.
 IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THERE ARE THINGS THAT YOU MIGHT TAKE HOME WITH YOU. EVERY DAY.
 LIKE WHAT?
 THE KIDS.
 WHAT ABOUT THE KIDS?
