 MANEUVER INTO SOME SORT OF TALKS THAT WOULD BE THE BEST POSITION FOR THEM. OKAY.
 KIM BER LE THANK YOU FOR THE EXPERTISE.
 APPRECIATE IT.
 ALL RIGHT. IT IS THE TOP OF THE HOUR.
 GOOD MONDAY MORNING.
 IM IN NEW YORK. HES ACCUSED OF SEEKING OUT MINERS AND PAYING CASH TO GIRLS AS YOUNG AS 14 YEARS OLD AND THEN PAYING THEM TO RECRUIT OTHER GIRLS FOR HIM TO ABU ANUND IN PUBLIC.CHARGES WILL BE A PRESS CONFERENCE WILL BE HELD WITH PROSECUTORS AND THE FBI AND LATER THIS MORNING EPSTEIN WILL APPEAR IN COURT. OUR ANCHOR AND NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT ERICA HILL IS ME COURTHOUSE.
 WE BEGIN WITH THIS HOUR FEDERAL PROSECUTORS HAVE JUST UNSEALED AN INDICTMENT AGAINST JEFFREY EP TEEN. STILL UNKNOWN WHAT THIS CASE COULD REVEAL ABOUT HIS POLITICAL CONNTIS AND THEY INCLUDE A BRITISH ROYAL A PRESIDENT AND THE CURRENT ONE EPSTEIN QUOTE A TERRIFIC GUY. WE HAVE TEAM COVERAGE THIS MORNING.
 INSIDE IT THE ALARMING DETAILS OF HOW THE POLITICALLY CONNECTED BILLIONAIRE ALLEGEDLY RAN A SEX TRAFFICKING RING. SHIMON Y HELDRE ND ADEY ENCOUNT ESCALATED.
 AND SOME OF THE GIRLS SAYING  IN SOME OF JULIE BROWNS REPORTING WE SHOULD POINT OUT. THE ALLEGED VICTIMS TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY DIDNT KNOW IT WAS GOING TO MAYBE GO THAT WAY.
 OR THEY KNEW IT WASNT RIGHT BUT AGAIN THEY WERE YOUNG AND DIDNT GET IT.
 AND IT ALSO POINTS OUT IN THE INDICTMENT THAT THEY BELIEVE PROSECUTORS BELIEVE HE DID KNOW THEIR AGES AND WHAT WAS GOING ON BECAUSE SOME OF THESE VICTIMS WHO WERE IN HERE WERE ASKED SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THEIR AGE AND THEY SAID THEY DIDNT LIE.
 LETS TALK ABOUT THE POWERFUL PEOPLE IN POLITICS THAT WERE FRIENDS INCLUDING PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON WHICH I THINK RECORDS SHOW FLEW ON HIS JET SEVERAL TIMES.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP IS QUOTED WITH GLOWING WORDS ABOUT HIM BACK IN NAIN FACT.
 IN 2002 HE TALKED ABOUT HIM TO NEW YORK MAGAZINE HE SAID HES A TERRIFIC GUY HES A LOT OF FUN TO BE WITH.
 ITS EVEN SAID THAT HE LIKES BEAUTIFUL WOMEN AS MUCH AS I DO AND MANY OF THEM ARE ON THE YOUNGER SIDE.
 NO DOUBT ABOUT IT JEFFREY ENJOYS HIS SOCIAL LIGHT.
 OBVIOUSLY THATS SEEN IN A FAR DIFFERENT LIGHT TODAY.
 BUT THERE IS A CONNECTION HERE.
 YOU MENTIONED FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON FLYING ON HIS PLANE BEING ON HIS PRIVATE ISLAND.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP REPORTEDLY ON HIS PLANE.
 AND AT ONE POINT EP TEEN WAS A MEMBER OF MARALAGO AND HAD BEEN THERE BUT WAS BARRED AT ONE POINT.
 HE WAS ACCUSED OF SEXUALLY ASSAULTING AN UNDERAGE GIRL THERE.
 I WOULD BE REMISS NOT TO BRING UP WITH YOU THE CURRENT LABOR SECRETARY ALEXANDER ACOSTA WHO IS VERY TIED TO THIS BECAUSE HE WAS A PART OF SECURING THE SWEET PLEA DEAL FOR EPSTEIN BACK IN 2008 THAT GOT HIM VERY LITTLE JAIL TIME CHARGED WITH PROSTITUTION NOT SEX TRAFFICKING AND BY THE WAY THAT NONE OF THE VICTIMS KNEW ABOUT. NO.
 THEY DIDNT. SO A COUPLE OF POINTS THERE.
 NUMBER ONE YOURE RIGHT.
 ALEXANDER ACOSTA AT THE TIME WAS THE U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT SO HE HAD TO OVERSEE THIS DEAL.
 HE TO SAY OKAY WITH TEAM OF ATTORNEYS.
 AT THE TIME HE SAID THEY LACKED THE EVIDENCE TO PROVE THAT HE HAD VIOLATED FEDERAL LIEU.
 THERES BEEN A LOT OF PUSHBACK ON THAT SINCE.
 WELL THE DOJ IS INVESTIGATING HOW THE CASE WAS HANDLE.
 WE SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT IN FEBRUARY A FEDERAL JUDGE SAID THIS DEAL BROKE THE LAW BECAUSE THE VICTIMS DIDNT KNOW ABOUT IT.
 THE TERMS OF THIS DEAL WHICH ITS BEEN SAID MULTIPLE TIMES WERE BASICALLY DICTATED BY EPSTEINS ATTORNEYS POWERFUL ATTORNEYS THEY DIDNT KNOW ABOUT IT.
 THE DEAL WAS KEPT QUIET AND KEPT APART FROM THE VICTIMS UNTIL A JUDGE SIGNED OFF ON IT.
 YOU CANT DO THAT. THAT BROKE THE LAW.
 GREAT REPORTING.
 OBVIOUSLY WELL BE ON THIS ALL DAY BECAUSE HES GOING TO BE IN COURTHIS MORNING.
 LETS TALK ABOUT WHERE THIS GORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR IS HERE.ARE A G VOICE THIS BECAUSE YOUE ACTUALLY PROSECUTED SEX TRAFFICKING CASES BEFORE.
 ONE THING THAT SHIMON SAID OUTSIDHEOURTENTS AGO THAT STRUCK ME IS THAT WHAT MAY BE DIFFERENT THIS TIME THAN THE PLEA DEAL IN 2008 IF THIS GOES TO TRIAL IS THAT THEY HAE THREE COOPERATORS AND THOSEORE APPARENTLY SOME OF THE EMPLOYEES THAT ARRANGED THE TRAVEL OF THE UNDERAGE GIRLS TO BE WITH EPSTEIN.
 HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THAT?
 WELL ITS IMPORTANT.
 I MEAN FRANKLY I THINK THE CASE IS GOING TO RISE AND FALL FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ON THE TESTIMONY OF THOSE COOPERATORS.
 THESE CASES ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO INVESTIGATE. THEYRE VERY DIFFICULT TO PROSECUTE.
 OFTEN MINORS WHO ARE ABUSED HAVE DIFFICULTY COMING FORWARD AND TESTIFYING.
 THEY HAVE DIFFICULTY YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY GOING THROUGH AND DOING WHAT THEY WOULD NEED TO DO TO BE A I A CASE.
 SO REALLY HERE THE TESTIMONY OF THOSE HAS TO BE STRONG IN ORDER FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT TO MAKE ITS CASE IN COURT.
 AND WHAT I THINK THIS INDICTMENT TELLS US IS THAT THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT BELIEVES THAT THEY HAVE TESTIMONY THAT CAN BACK THESE CHARGES UP.
 WHEN YOU DEAL THAT WAS STRUCK THAT RAISED SO MANY QUESTIONS THAT THE VICTIMS DIDNT KNOW ABOUT WHAT DO YOU THINK THE QUESTIONS ARE GOING TO BE NOW NOT ONLY FOR ALEXANDER ACOSTA THE LABOR SECRETARY WHO WAS A BIG PART OF THIS BUT THE JUDGE WHO SIGNED OFF ON IT?
 YEAH I HAVE TO SAY THERE ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT QUESTIONS ABOUT MR. ACOSTAS ACTS THERE.
 REALLY THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING VERY SIGNIFICANT BEHINDTHESCENES THAT CAUSED THAT SERIES OF EVENTS.
 THERES CLEARLY MISCONDUCT BY NOT INFORMING VICTIMS.
 IT APPEARS AT SOME POINT THERE WERE MISREPRESENTATIONS THAT WERE MADE TO THE COURT.
 VERY SERIOUS MISCONDUCT BY JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ATTORNEYS.
 PARTICULARLY IN CASES LIKE THIS WHEN I DID INVESTIGATE SEX TRAFFICKING CASES THOSE VICTIMS ARE COUNTING ON YOU AS A PROSECUTOR.
 THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO HAVE ACCESS TO YOU AND THEY ARE COUNTING ON YOU TO PROSECUTE AND ACT FAIRLY.
 ANDT IS INTERESTING THAT THE FEDERAL PROSECUTORS WORKING ON THIS THAT ARE GOING TO HOLD THIS PRESS CONFERENCE IN A LITTLE UNDER AN HOUR ARE FROM THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORKS PUBLIC CORRUPTION UNIT.
 WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?
 COULD BE THEYUST HAVE TIME E THEIR PLATES.
 BUT IT ALSO COULD MEAN THAT THERES SOME TIE TOHIS CASE EITHER FROM THE ANGLE YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT OR ANOTHER THERES ON POTENTIAL OBSTRUCTION PROVISION.
 PERHAPS THERE IS A PUBLIC OFFICIAL THAT COULD THAT IS AT LEAST INVOLVED IN T CASE OUE ALL REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED.
 THANK YOU SO MUCH.
 ALSO THIS MORNING AS MORE IMAGES AND REPORTS OFHUMANE COE MIGRANT FIEM BORDER THE PR SAYS HE NOW WANTS THE MEDIA TO GO INSIDE AND SEE FOR THEMSELVES.
 KAITLYN US FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.
 GOOD MORNING TO YOU.
 KAITLYN THE PRESIDENT SAYS HE WANTS THIS BUT THERES A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SAYING THAT AND THE FACILITIES ACTUALLY LETTING IN JOURNALISTS WITH CAMERASUNANNOUNCED.
 SO FAR THEYVE BEEN HESITANT NOT WANTAWMAKERS TO BRING THEIR PHONES INTO THE FACILITIES.
 SO WHETHER OR NOT THAT INVITATION ISNG TO GO FORWARD IS STILL AN OPEN QUESTION.
 BUT SO FAR THE PRESIDENT AND HI REPORTS ABOUT THESE CONDITIONS AT THE BORDER.
 HERES WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID WHEN HE WAS ON HIS WAY BACK TO THE WHITE HOUSE YESTERDAY.
 IM GOING TO START SHOWING SOME OF THESE DETENTION CENTERS TO THE PRESS.
 THEYRE CROWDED AND WERE THE ONES WHO ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT THEYRE CROWDED.
 SO THE PRESIDENT THERE GOING AFTER NOT ONLY SOME OF THOSE DEMOCRATIC LAWMAKERS WHO HAVE BEEN REPORTING WHAT THEY SAW WHEN THEYVE TOURED THESE FACILITIES.
 WE SHOULD NOTE ITS NOT JUST ONE SINGULAR REPORT DETAILING THESE CONDITIONS THAT THEY SAY ARE WIDESPREAD AT THESE FACILITIES.
 OVERCROWDING AND STANDING ROOM ONLY.
 PEOPLE GOING WITHOUT HOT MEALS.
 ITS COMING FROM A REPORT FROM THE PRESIDENTS OWN GOVERNMENT AND A VERY SPECIFIC IN THE NEW YORK TIMES THAT CAME OUT YESTERDAY AND PEOPLE SHOULD READ.
 AND NATASHA YOURE THERE AND YOU SPOKE TO A REP WHO SAYS BORDER PATROL AGENTS HAVE BEEN TRYING FOR SOME TIME TO BRING THESE CONDITIONS TO LIGHT.
 THATS RIGHT POPPY.
 WE WERE TALKING TO REPRESENTATIVE MARY GONE SQUALL ES. SHE REPRESENTS THE AREA WHERE THE FACILITY IS.
 SHE SAYS THAT LOCAL LEADERS LIKE HERSELF AND THE COMMUNITY DID NOT EVEN KNOW THAT UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN WERE BEING PROCESSED THROUGH THAT FACILITY UNTIL NEWS REPOS CAME OUT IN THE LAST MONTH OR SO ABOUT THE CONDITIONS INSIDE.
 SHE SAID THAT SOME OF THESE ATROL AGENTS WHOA LIVE IN THIS COMMUNITY WAVE KNOWN HER FOR A LONG TIME THEY HAVE BEEN TELLING HER ABOUT HOW DEMORALIZING AND SDPRESING IT IS TO WORK IN THE CONDITIONS BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY ARE SEEING DAY TO DAY WITH THE MIGRANTS.
 THEYVE ALSO TOLD HER ABOUT HOW HUNDREDS OF CHILDREN AT ONE POINT WERE BEING PROCESSED THROUGH THAT FACILITY IN A SPACE THATS REALLY NOT DESIGNED FOR THAT MANY KIDS AND BEING HELD THERE FOR LONGER THAN THEY SHOULD BE THERE WITH LIMITED SHOWER AND SHOWER FACILITIES TO WASH UP LIMITED MICROWAVES TO HEAT FOOD TO FEED THEM.
 HERES WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY ABOUT HER CONVERSATIONS WITH THESE AGENTS.
 A LOT OF THE PEOPLE I TALKED TO WHO WORKED THERE WERE SAYING WE HAVE BEEN TELLING HIGHERUPS THERES A PROBLEM.
 AND BASICALLY THOSE PLEAS HAVE BEEN IGNORED.
 A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WHO I TALKED TO HAVE BEEN IN THE BORDER PATROL FOR DECADES 23 YEARS 24 YEARS. THIS IS SOMETHING VERY NEW TO THEM.
