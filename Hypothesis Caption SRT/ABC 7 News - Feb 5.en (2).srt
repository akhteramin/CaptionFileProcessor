   When it comes to managing    
   your type 2 diabetes,        

2772
06:27:24,841 --> 06:27:24,845
      what matters to you?      

2773
06:27:24,846 --> 06:27:24,850
           Let's see.           
   Most of you say lower A1C.   

2774
06:27:24,851 --> 06:27:24,855
     But only a few of you      

2775
06:27:24,856 --> 06:27:24,860
 are thinking about your heart. 

2776
06:27:24,861 --> 06:27:24,865
    Fact is, even though        
    it helps to manage A1C,     

2777
06:27:24,866 --> 06:27:24,870
     type 2 diabetes still      
     increases your risk        

2778
06:27:24,871 --> 06:27:24,875
       of a fatal heart         
       attack or stroke.        

2779
06:27:24,876 --> 06:27:24,880
     JARDIANCE is the first     
     type 2 diabetes pill       

2780
06:27:24,881 --> 06:27:24,885
       with a lifesaving        
     cardiovascular benefit     

2781
06:27:24,886 --> 06:27:24,890
  for adults who have type 2    
  diabetes and heart disease,   

2782
06:27:24,891 --> 06:27:24,895
   JARDIANCE significantly      
   reduces the risk of dying    

2783
06:27:24,896 --> 06:27:24,900
  from a cardiovascular event   

2784
06:27:24,901 --> 06:27:24,905
        and lowers A1C,         
    with diet and exercise.     

2785
06:27:24,906 --> 06:27:24,910

 Isn't it time to rethink your  
 type 2 diabetes medication?    

2811
06:27:25,036 --> 06:27:25,040
Ask your doctor about JARDIANCE 

2812
06:27:25,041 --> 06:27:25,045
      and get to the heart      
      of what matters.

If you were choosing a network, 
would you want the one

RootMetrics say                 

2929
06:27:25,626 --> 06:27:25,630
is number one                   
in the nation?                  

2930
06:27:25,631 --> 06:27:25,635
Sure, they probably know        
what they're talking about.

           who use it every day?

2934
06:27:25,651 --> 06:27:25,655
This is a tough one.            
               Well, not really,

2935
06:27:25,656 --> 06:27:25,660
       because Verizon won both.

2936
06:27:25,661 --> 06:27:25,665
               So you don't even
               have to choose.  

2937
06:27:25,666 --> 06:27:25,670
  Why didn't you just

3025
06:27:26,106 --> 06:27:26,110
  to help reduce your risk of   
  fracture with Prolia®.

with 1 shot every 6 months.     

3028

Do not take Prolia® if you have 
low blood calcium, are pregnant,

3034
06:27:26,151 --> 06:27:26,155
 Tell your doctor about dental  
 problems                       

3035
06:27:26,156 --> 06:27:26,160

3038
06:27:26,171 --> 06:27:26,175
  Speak to your doctor before   
  stopping Prolia®              

3039
06:27:26,176 --> 06:27:26,180

    fractures have occurred.    

3040
06:27:26,181 --> 06:27:26,185
 Prolia® can cause serious side 
 effects,                       

3041
06:27:26,186 --> 06:27:26,190

3042
06:27:26,191 --> 06:27:26,195
which could need                
hospitalization, skin problems, 

3043
06:27:26,196 --> 06:27:26,200

         Are you ready?         

3045
06:27:26,206 --> 06:27:26,210
Ask your doctor how Prolia® can 
help strengthen your bones.     

3046
06:27:26,211 --> 06:27:26,215
    Gentle means everything,

3062
06:27:26,291 --> 06:27:26,295
         Because that's         
        how it should be.

     about screening options    

3092

         and her doctor

NOW THERE IS A MOVEMENT I THINK 

4723
07:16:41,163 --> 07:16:43,263
TELEPHONE, EITHER ONE.          
NOW THERE IS A MOVEMENT I THINK 
FOR CORRECTLY TO REQUIRE A      

4724
07:16:43,265 --> 07:16:45,365
NOW THERE IS A MOVEMENT I THINK 
FOR CORRECTLY TO REQUIRE A      
WARRANT, EVEN FOR OLDER, NOT    

4725
07:16:45,367 --> 07:16:47,301

07:16:47,303 --> 07:16:48,535
WARRANT, EVEN FOR OLDER, NOT    
JUST CURRENT E-MAILS, TO USE THE
INFORMATION, YOU HAVE TO GO     

4727
07:16:48,537 --> 07:16:51,371
JUST CURRENT E-MAILS, TO USE THE

07:16:51,841 --> 07:16:53,040
THROUGH VARIOUS KIND OF HOOPS TO
GET PERMISSION.                 
SO I DO THINK THAT THE          

4730
07:16:53,042 --> 07:16:54,241
GET PERMISSION.                 
SO I DO THINK THAT THE          
GOVERNMENT, ALTHOUGH YOU CAN    

4731
07:16:54,243 --> 07:16:56,143
