00:40:55,482 --> 00:40:56,748
Jimmy's gotten used to his whole
room smelling like sweaty odors.

1070
00:40:56,784 --> 00:40:59,618
   Yup, he's gone Noseblind.    

1071
00:40:59,653 --> 00:41:03,338
 He thinks it smells fine, but  
 his mom smells this...         

1072
00:41:03,374 --> 00:41:05,490
    Luckily for all your        
    hard-to-wash fabrics...     

1073
00:41:05,509 --> 00:41:07,542
       ...there's Febreze       
       Fabric Refresher.        

1074
00:41:07,594 --> 00:41:10,429
 Febreze doesn't just mask, it  
 eliminates odors you've...     

1075
00:41:10,464 --> 00:41:12,347
     ...gone noseblind to.      

1076
00:41:12,383 --> 00:41:14,349
    And try Febreze             
    Unstopables for fabric.     

1077
00:41:14,385 --> 00:41:16,968
With up to twice the fresh scent
power, you'll want to try it... 

1078
00:41:17,003 --> 00:41:19,638
  ...again and again and maybe  
  just one more time.           

1079
00:41:19,673 --> 00:41:21,673
         Indulge in irresistible
         freshness.

 (Announcer)                    
 Do you push through migraine?  

1089
00:41:56,643 --> 00:41:58,143
    (Daughter)                  
    Mom, are you OK to play?    

1090
00:41:58,445 --> 00:42:00,712
(Mom)                           
Yeah honey, how about we play...

1091
00:42:00,981 --> 00:42:02,814
     princess and pirates?      

1092
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:06,151
  (Announcer)                   
  Imagine what you can do with  
  more migraine-free days.      

1093
00:42:10,991 --> 00:42:12,157
            (Pirate)            
            Arr!                

1094
00:42:12,726 --> 00:42:13,925
           (Mom)                
           En garde!            

1095
00:42:15,496 --> 00:42:17,062
    (Announcer)                 
    When you're not fighting    
    through migraine            

1096
00:42:17,164 --> 00:42:18,997
   imagine the possibilities.   

1097
00:42:19,099 --> 00:42:22,067
 Once-monthly Emgality is used  
 for the prevention             

1098
00:42:22,169 --> 00:42:23,335
     of migraine in adults.     

1099
00:42:23,437 --> 00:42:25,470
 It's specifically developed to 
 help give you                  

1100
00:42:25,572 --> 00:42:27,105
    more migraine-free days.    

1101
00:42:27,341 --> 00:42:30,575
 With Emgality about 60% of     
 people had their migraine days 

1102
00:42:30,677 --> 00:42:31,843
      cut in half or more.      

1103
00:42:31,945 --> 00:42:34,779
Do not use if you are allergic  
to Emgality or its ingredients. 

1104
00:42:36,016 --> 00:42:38,049
  Emgality may cause allergic   
  reactions, such as            

1105
00:42:38,151 --> 00:42:40,151
    itching, rash, hives and    
    trouble breathing,          

1106
00:42:40,254 --> 00:42:41,686
which can happen days after use.

1107
00:42:41,989 --> 00:42:43,722
Call your doctor or get medical 
help right away                 

1108
00:42:43,824 --> 00:42:45,690
   if you have symptoms of an   
   allergic reaction.           

1109
00:42:45,792 --> 00:42:47,058
      The most common side      
      effects include           

1110
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,493
   injection site reactions.    

1111
00:42:48,595 --> 00:42:49,761
  (Mom)                         
  What should we do tomorrow?   

1112
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:51,630
(Announcer)                     
Ask your doctor about Emgality. 

1113
00:42:51,732 --> 00:43:07,846
     Learn about savings at     
     Emgality.com               

1114
00:43:24,163 --> 00:43:25,230
 When I received the diagnosis, 

1115
00:43:25,265 --> 00:43:26,915
   I knew, whatever it takes,   

1116
00:43:26,967 --> 00:43:29,584
  wherever I have to go... I'm  
         beating this.          

1117
00:43:29,636 --> 00:43:31,886
   Breast cancer treatment is   
     continuing to evolve.      

1118
00:43:31,922 --> 00:43:35,540
 CTCA is definitely on the cusp 
       of those changes.        

1119
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:37,475
 We really focus on taking the  
             time               

1120
00:43:37,511 --> 00:43:38,927
 with each individual patient   

1121
00:43:38,979 --> 00:43:41,813
so they can choose the treatment
     appropriate for them.      

1122
00:43:41,848 --> 00:43:43,565
 I empower women with choices.  

1123
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:45,150
    It's not just picking a     
           surgeon.             

1124
00:43:45,185 --> 00:43:49,854
It's picking the care team, and 
 feeling secure where you are.
