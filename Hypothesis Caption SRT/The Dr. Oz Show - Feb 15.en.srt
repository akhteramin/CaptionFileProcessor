    trouble breathing,

760
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:27,464
BUT HERE'S THE CATCH.           
WHEN YOU DON'T WASH YOUR JEANS, 

761
00:31:27,466 --> 00:31:29,866
WHEN YOU DON'T WASH YOUR JEANS, 
THIS FABRIC STARTS TO STRETCH.

00:31:29,868 --> 00:31:31,935
THIS FABRIC STARTS TO STRETCH.  
THEY BECOME VERY COMFORTABLE.

A LITTLE LOOSE?                 

765
00:31:35,441 --> 00:31:38,041
A LITTLE LOOSE?                 
DON'T YOU FEEL GOOD ABOUT LIFE?

DON'T YOU FEEL GOOD ABOUT LIFE? 
YOU ARE LOSING WEIGHT, RIGHT?   

767
00:31:39,945 --> 00:31:42,579
YOU ARE LOSING WEIGHT, RIGHT?   
YOU COULD EAT A LITTLE EXTRA    

768
00:31:42,581 --> 00:31:44,715
YOU COULD EAT A LITTLE EXTRA    
BECAUSE THE JEANS ARE LOOSE ON  

769
00:31:44,717 --> 00:31:44,982
BECAUSE THE JEANS ARE LOOSE ON  
YOU.                            

770
00:31:44,984 --> 00:31:47,918
YOU.                            
WHO CARES ABOUT THE SCALE?      

771
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,020
WHO CARES ABOUT THE SCALE?      
THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TO WASH OUR 

772
00:31:50,022 --> 00:31:52,990
THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TO WASH OUR 
JEANS EVERY THREE OR FOUR TIMES,

773
00:31:52,992 --> 00:31:55,793
JEANS EVERY THREE OR FOUR TIMES,
BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEY STRETCH  

774
00:31:55,795 --> 00:31:56,360
BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEY STRETCH  
FURTHER OUT AND WE ARE          

775
00:31:56,362 --> 00:31:56,927
FURTHER OUT AND WE ARE          
SABOTAGING OUR DIETS.

985
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:31,718
THAT IS NOT WATER.              
THEN IT GOES THROUGH A CLEANING 

986
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,320
THEN IT GOES THROUGH A CLEANING 
PROCESS WITH A DETERGENT, AND IT

987
00:40:34,322 --> 00:40:34,921
PROCESS WITH A DETERGENT, AND IT
