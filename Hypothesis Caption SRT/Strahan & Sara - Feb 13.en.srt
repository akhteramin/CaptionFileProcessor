 Once-monthly Emgality is used  
 for the prevention             

1442
00:48:08,284 --> 00:48:09,517

 help give you                  

1444

    more migraine-free days.    

1445
00:48:13,523 --> 00:48:16,757
 With Emgality about 60% of     
 people had their migraine days 

1446
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:18,025
      cut in half or more.      

1447
00:48:18,127 --> 00:48:20,962
Do not use if you are allergic  
to Emgality or its ingredients. 

1448
00:48:22,198 --> 00:48:24,231
  Emgality may cause allergic   
  reactions, such as            

1449
00:48:24,267 --> 00:48:26,334
    itching, rash, hives and    
    trouble breathing,          

1450
00:48:26,369 --> 00:48:27,868
which can happen days after use.

      The most common side
