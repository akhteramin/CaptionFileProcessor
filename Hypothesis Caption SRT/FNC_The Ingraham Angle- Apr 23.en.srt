       in just a few days.      

1366
00:56:54,361 --> 00:56:57,429

    desperate need.             

1367
00:56:58,865 --> 00:57:02,934
These are very difficult times  
for Israel and the Jewish       
people.                         

1368
00:57:02,969 --> 00:57:04,769
    As the government spends

00:57:04,805 --> 00:57:08,673
more and more of it's resources 
for battling terrorism.

00:57:09,543 --> 00:57:12,110
  The situation has become a    
  crisis.

00:57:13,046 --> 00:57:16,114

1372
00:57:16,149 --> 00:57:19,818
There are more people who come  
than they expect                

1373
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:22,020
   because the numbers keep     
   growing.

  Many of these people are ill

00:59:22,276 --> 00:59:23,675
       has been excellent.
