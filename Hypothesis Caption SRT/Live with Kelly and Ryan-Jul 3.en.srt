we went to breakfast, and I was 

939
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,170
we went to breakfast, and I was 
juggling a million things, and  

940
00:20:23,172 --> 00:20:24,237
juggling a million things, and  
I think it's like, you know,    

941
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:26,073
I think it's like, you know,    
really wise to go alone         

942
00:20:26,075 --> 00:20:26,740
really wise to go alone         
with three kids.                

943
00:20:26,742 --> 00:20:27,407
with three kids.

And then next thing you know,   

946
00:20:30,245 --> 00:20:32,612
And then next thing you know,   
I'm not eating, I'm juggling    

947
00:20:32,614 --> 00:20:34,648
I'm not eating, I'm juggling    
everything, and I go to Ryder,  

948
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,650
everything, and I go to Ryder,  
"Ryder, just take Rani," and I  

949
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:37,984
"Ryder, just take Rani," and I  
went to go get my food at the   

950
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:40,620
went to go get my food at the   
buffet, and I looked over, and  

951
00:20:40,622 --> 00:20:42,723
buffet, and I looked over, and  
here's this young man holding   

952
00:20:42,725 --> 00:20:44,124
here's this young man holding   
his sis--I--it was the          

953
00:20:44,126 --> 00:20:46,426
his sis--I--it was the          
craziest image to me.           

954
00:20:46,428 --> 00:20:48,495
craziest image to me.           
and I just thought, life is     

955
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,596
and I just thought, life is     
really weird.

It's one of those things.       
I've been working               

1168
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,670
I've been working               
really hard on it.              

1169
00:24:50,672 --> 00:24:52,906
really hard on it.              
I feel like every time I put my 

1170
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,107
I feel like every time I put my 
name to anything, whether I'm   

1171
00:24:54,109 --> 00:24:55,442
name to anything, whether I'm   
endorsing it or making it like  

1172
00:24:55,444 --> 00:24:58,244
endorsing it or making it like  
this, I have to believe in it   

1173
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,112
this, I have to believe in it   
and it has to be something that 

1174
00:24:59,114 --> 00:25:00,079
and it has to be something that 
I feel is important.            

1175
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,881
I feel is important.            
And so this is a very           

1176
00:25:01,883 --> 00:25:03,349
And so this is a very           
eco-friendly line, and the      

1177
00:25:03,351 --> 00:25:05,285
eco-friendly line, and the      
fashion industry is like the    

1178
00:25:05,287 --> 00:25:07,654
fashion industry is like the    
worst--number two worst carbon  

1179
00:25:07,656 --> 00:25:10,423

footprint of all industries.    

1180
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:11,791

And I really feel like the      

1181
00:25:11,793 --> 00:25:13,226
And I really feel like the      
fashion industry needs to look  

1182
00:25:13,228 --> 00:25:14,327
fashion industry needs to look  
at how they're making things and

1183
00:25:14,329 --> 00:25:16,429
at how they're making things and
start changing the way that they

1184
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:18,031
start changing the way that they
do stuff, and it's--            

1185
00:25:18,033 --> 00:25:18,965
do stuff, and it's--

The challenges at the beginning 

1277
00:29:53,675 --> 00:29:54,540
The challenges at the beginning 
for you                         

1278
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:55,508

and what you did to overcome,   
to get to be who you are now.   

1280
00:29:56,644 --> 00:29:59,478
to get to be who you are now.

A lot of different obstacles,   

1282
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,148
A lot of different obstacles,   
but I think that that's what    

1283
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:04,784
makes the journey fun.s what    
You know, from nothing          

1284
00:30:04,786 --> 00:30:05,785
You know, from nothing          
to something.                   

1285
00:30:05,787 --> 00:30:06,452
to something.                   
A whole lot of "no"s,           

1286
00:30:06,454 --> 00:30:07,353
A whole lot of "no"s,           
that's for sure.                

1287
00:30:07,355 --> 00:30:08,321
that's for sure.                
And a whole lot of "you can't," 

1288
00:30:08,323 --> 00:30:09,822
And a whole lot of "you can't," 
"you won't," "you never will,"  

1289
00:30:09,824 --> 00:30:10,890
"you won't," "you never will,"  
"don't," "you're crazy,"        

1290
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,024
"don't," "you're crazy,"        
"how dare you?"                 

1291
00:30:12,026 --> 00:30:12,758
"how dare you?"                 
"Impossible."                   

1292
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,759
"Impossible."                   
And then I flipped every word,  

1293
00:30:13,761 --> 00:30:14,493
And then I flipped every word,  
by the way.                     

1294
00:30:14,495 --> 00:30:15,695
by the way.                     
So my daughter taught me in the 

1295
00:30:15,697 --> 00:30:17,463
So my daughter taught me in the 
word "impossible" is "possible."

1296
00:30:17,465 --> 00:30:18,130
word "impossible" is "possible."
>> Both: Yeah.                  

1297
00:30:18,132 --> 00:30:18,798
>> Both: Yeah.                  
>> Right?                       

1298
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,765
>> Right?                       
And I took the word "can't"     

1299
00:30:19,767 --> 00:30:21,334
And I took the word "can't"     
is "can."                       

1300
00:30:21,336 --> 00:30:22,835
is "can."                       
"Won't" is "won."               

1301
00:30:22,837 --> 00:30:24,770
"Won't" is "won."               
"Don't" is "do."                

1302
00:30:24,772 --> 00:30:25,504
"Don't" is "do."                
And that's exactly what we doing

1303
00:30:25,506 --> 00:30:26,305
And that's exactly what we doing
with our career.

A guy named DMX

A guy named DMX                 
was a part of it.

00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:44,457
was a part of it.               
I was very--I was invited to

It'll be out--                  

1365
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:27,867
It'll be out--                  
>> Ryan: And also when you were 

1366
00:31:27,869 --> 00:31:29,769
>> Ryan: And also when you were 
growing up and your mom would   

1367
00:31:29,771 --> 00:31:31,504
growing up and your mom would   
put on tapes of Tony Robbins    

1368
00:31:31,506 --> 00:31:32,371
put on tapes of Tony Robbins    
in the car, right?              

1369
00:31:32,373 --> 00:31:33,272
in the car, right?              
>> So I lived in a neighborhood 

1370
00:31:33,274 --> 00:31:35,074
>> So I lived in a neighborhood 
called Carol City in Miami.     

1371
00:31:35,076 --> 00:31:37,877
called Carol City in Miami.     
And I was not trying to listen  

1372
00:31:37,879 --> 00:31:38,544
And I was not trying to listen  
to Tony Robbins.                

1373
00:31:38,546 --> 00:31:39,845
to Tony Robbins.                
And whenever my mom could take  

1374
00:31:39,847 --> 00:31:41,747
And whenever my mom could take  
me to school, it was a '82 Pinto

1375
00:31:41,749 --> 00:31:42,615
me to school, it was a '82 Pinto

So for M'Baku, I gained         

1818
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,340
So for M'Baku, I gained         
about 40 pounds.                

1819
00:45:29,342 --> 00:45:31,909
about 40 pounds.                
And then for upcoming movie,    

1820
00:45:31,911 --> 00:45:34,111
And then for upcoming movie,    
"Us," Jordan Peele didn't want  

1821
00:45:34,113 --> 00:45:36,080
"Us," Jordan Peele didn't want  
me to feel like a superhero, so 

1822
00:45:36,082 --> 00:45:36,981
me to feel like a superhero, so 
he was like, "If you could just 

1823
00:45:36,983 --> 00:45:39,183
he was like, "If you could just 
eat some burgers or something." 

1824
00:45:39,185 --> 00:45:40,952
eat some burgers or something." 
So you can look just like a dad

00:45:40,954 --> 00:45:42,487
So you can look just like a dad 
who has responsibilities        

1826
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:43,821
who has responsibilities

this is a uniquely male thing   

1830
00:45:48,728 --> 00:45:51,128
this is a uniquely male thing   
that men in their roles can go  

1831
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:52,330
that men in their roles can go  
up and down the scale with

00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:53,798
up and down the scale with

1833
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,765

fun, but then losing the weight 

1838
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,005

is not.

you know, being in that space,

you know, being in that space,  
being in that headspace and that

00:51:15,154 --> 00:51:17,688
being in that headspace and that
body was really tough to stay   

1936

body was really tough to stay   
in, because you had to go a--

in, because you had to go a--   
I have to go to a really        

1938
00:51:20,726 --> 00:51:22,259
I have to go to a really        
interesting place.              

1939
00:51:22,261 --> 00:51:22,926
interesting place.              
But we're--we were              

1940
00:51:22,928 --> 00:51:23,594
But we're--we were              
well supported.                 

1941
00:51:23,596 --> 00:51:25,095
well supported.

1942
00:51:25,097 --> 00:51:28,031
>> Kelly: Was it a heavy place? 
>> Um, heavy emotionally,       

1943
00:51:28,033 --> 00:51:30,100
>> Um, heavy emotionally,       
because--I can't tell you       

1944
00:51:30,102 --> 00:51:31,201
because--I can't tell you       
anything without giving         

1945
00:51:31,203 --> 00:51:33,103
anything without giving         
a big spoiler.                  

1946
00:51:33,105 --> 00:51:35,205
a big spoiler.                  
But it's a dark place for these 

1947
00:51:35,207 --> 00:51:36,840
But it's a dark place for these 
characters, and I never         

1948
00:51:36,842 --> 00:51:37,508
characters, and I never         
judge them.                     

1949
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:38,375
judge them.                     
I never looked at them          

1950
00:51:38,377 --> 00:51:40,711
I never looked at them          
as any kind of a villain.       

1951
00:51:40,713 --> 00:51:41,945
as any kind of a villain.

1952
00:51:41,947 --> 00:51:42,780

>> At all.                      

1953
00:51:42,782 --> 00:51:44,114
>> At all.                      
So that was a really big        

1954
00:51:44,116 --> 00:51:46,316
So that was a really big        
important part of doing the work

1955
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:47,918
important part of doing the work
is not judging those characters,

1956
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,887
is not judging those characters,
especially these ones.          

1957
00:51:49,889 --> 00:51:50,721
especially these ones.          
And you'll find out             

1958
00:51:50,723 --> 00:51:51,388
And you'll find out             
really soon why.

00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:52,289
