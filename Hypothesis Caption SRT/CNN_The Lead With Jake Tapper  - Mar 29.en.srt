      I was there, jt not

00:11:24,504 --> 00:11:26,371
    So I talked to my doctor    
          about HUMIRA.         

254
00:11:26,473 --> 00:11:28,673
 I learned HUMIRA is for people 
     who still have symptoms    

255
00:11:28,742 --> 00:11:31,075
       of Crohn's disease

256
00:11:31,178 --> 00:11:32,610
        And the majority        
       of people on HUMIRA      

257
00:11:32,712 --> 00:11:35,647
 saw significant symptom relief 
   and many achieved remission  

258
00:11:35,715 --> 00:11:37,248
    in as little as 4 weeks.

     So, JARDIANCE asks...      

310
00:13:56,623 --> 00:13:58,390
        When it comes to        
        type 2 diabetes,        

311
00:13:58,392 --> 00:13:59,992
     are you thinking about     
          your heart?           

312
00:13:59,994 --> 00:14:01,460
   Well, I'm managing my A1C,   

313
00:14:01,462 --> 00:14:03,195
    so I should be all set.     

314
00:14:03,197 --> 00:14:03,862
             Right.             

315
00:14:03,897 --> 00:14:05,130
 Actually, you're still at risk 

316
00:14:05,165 --> 00:14:06,698
    for a fatal heart attack    
           or stroke.           

317
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,600
       Even if I'm taking       
        heart medicine,         

318
00:14:08,602 --> 00:14:09,835
like statins or blood thinners? 

319
00:14:10,271 --> 00:14:11,003
              Yep!              

320
00:14:11,372 --> 00:14:13,605
  That's why I asked my doctor  
    what else I could do...     

321
00:14:13,607 --> 00:14:15,340
  she told me about JARDIANCE.  

322
00:14:15,342 --> 00:14:16,074
         That's right.          

323
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,510
JARDIANCE significantly reduces 
       the risk of dying        

324
00:14:18,512 --> 00:14:19,778

    and known heart disease.    

327
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:25,651
That's why the American Diabetes
     Association recommends     

328
00:14:25,653 --> 00:14:27,352
     the active ingredient      
         in JARDIANCE.          

329
00:14:27,354 --> 00:14:28,587
       And it lowers A1C?       

330
00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:31,056
 Yeah- with diet and exercise.

I thought I married an Italian. 

1087
00:53:10,252 --> 00:53:14,154
My lineage was the Vecchios and 
  Zuccolis. Through Ancestry,   

1088
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:18,091
 through DNA I found out that I 
     was only 16% Italian.      

1089
00:53:18,127 --> 00:53:21,595
 He was 34% Eastern European.   

1090
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:23,764
   So I went onto Ancestry,     

1091
00:53:23,799 --> 00:53:26,900
  soon learned that one of our  
ancestors we thought was Italian

1092
00:53:26,969 --> 00:53:28,435
  was Eastern European.         

1093
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:30,771
   This is my ancestor who I    
      didn't know about.        

1094
00:53:30,806 --> 00:53:32,806
     He looks a little bit
