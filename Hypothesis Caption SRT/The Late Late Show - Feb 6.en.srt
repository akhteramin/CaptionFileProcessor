    I was on the fence about    
    changing                    

1644
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:45,947
  from a manual to an electric  
  toothbrush.                   

1645
00:59:45,982 --> 00:59:47,699
  But my hygienist said going   
  electric                      

1646
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:49,317
could lead to way cleaner teeth.

1647
00:59:49,336 --> 00:59:51,703
 She said, get the one inspired 
 by dentists,

00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:53,004

1662
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:18,079
Nope.                           
          Gaming with less lag?

01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:19,647
Nope.                           
          Watching movies in 4K?
