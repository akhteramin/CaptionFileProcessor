  more migraine-free days.

           En garde!            

431
00:16:08,866 --> 00:16:10,432
    (Announcer)                 
    When you're not fighting    
    through migraine            

432
00:16:10,534 --> 00:16:12,367
   imagine the possibilities.   

433
00:16:12,469 --> 00:16:15,437
 Once-monthly Emgality is used  
 for the prevention             

434
00:16:15,472 --> 00:16:16,705
     of migraine in adults.     

435
00:16:16,807 --> 00:16:18,840
 It's specifically developed to 
 help give you                  

436
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,475
    more migraine-free days.    

437
00:16:20,711 --> 00:16:23,945
 With Emgality about 60% of     
 people had their migraine days 

438
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,213
      cut in half or more.      

439
00:16:25,315 --> 00:16:28,149
Do not use if you are allergic  
to Emgality or its ingredients. 

440
00:16:29,386 --> 00:16:31,419
  Emgality may cause allergic   
  reactions, such as            

441
00:16:31,455 --> 00:16:33,521
    itching, rash, hives and    
    trouble breathing,          

442
00:16:33,557 --> 00:16:35,056
which can happen days after use.

443
00:16:35,358 --> 00:16:37,091
Call your doctor or get medical 
help right away                 

444
00:16:37,127 --> 00:16:39,060
   if you have symptoms of an   
   allergic reaction.           

445
00:16:39,095 --> 00:16:40,428
      The most common side      
      effects include           

446
00:16:40,463 --> 00:16:41,863
   injection site reactions.    

447
00:16:41,965 --> 00:16:43,131
