1
00:00:01,352 --> 00:00:03,986
     so they had to remove      
   the bone, like, the skull.   

2
00:00:05,423 --> 00:00:08,057
          - Francesca?          
             - Yes.             

3
00:00:08,059 --> 00:00:12,461
     - If I followed normal     
       protocol on this,        

4
00:00:12,463 --> 00:00:14,930
 you would end up with no car.  

5
00:00:16,734 --> 00:00:19,735
          (announcer)           
    - This is the courtroom     
     of Judge Frank Caprio      

6
00:00:19,737 --> 00:00:22,571
     where people and cases     
    are met with compassion.    

7
00:00:22,573 --> 00:00:24,907
   A different kind of judge.   

8
00:00:24,909 --> 00:00:26,609
          A courtroom           
         like no other.         

9
00:00:26,611 --> 00:00:28,411
            This is             
    "Caught in Providence."     

10
00:00:30,748 --> 00:00:32,014
      - Who's Mr. Holder?       

11
00:00:32,016 --> 00:00:34,617
   - Uh, this is Mr. Holder,    
          Your Honor.           

12
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:36,252
       - And, and are you       
         here with him?         

13
00:00:36,254 --> 00:00:39,755
  - Uh, yes, I'm his counselor  
   at the Riverwood program.    

14
00:00:39,757 --> 00:00:41,758
    - Okay, and who's gonna     
        do the speaking?        

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,292
           - Uh, I am           
    at Mr. Holder's request.    

16
00:00:43,294 --> 00:00:45,361
 - All right, what do you wanna 
      tell me about this?       

17
00:00:45,363 --> 00:00:48,464
  - Uh, basically, he received  
 the ticket on Sunday morning.  

18
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:49,732
      Uh, it's not at all       
      his first parking--       

19
00:00:49,734 --> 00:00:51,301
          - Saturday.           
          - I'm sorry?          

20
00:00:51,303 --> 00:00:54,137
  Saturday morning, I'm sorry.  
        It's not at all         
       his first ticket.        

21
00:00:54,139 --> 00:00:56,339
- He's had, he's had 31 tickets.

22
00:00:56,341 --> 00:00:59,008
        - Uh, obviously,        
       I'm his counselor        
    for significant reasons.    

23
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,844
At the same time, it's something
     that we're working on      

24
00:01:00,846 --> 00:01:02,979
  engagingly with Mr. Holder.   

25
00:01:02,981 --> 00:01:04,981
 And, uh, truthfully, speaking, 
    the tickets are becoming    

26
00:01:04,983 --> 00:01:07,083
   further and further apart.   

27
00:01:07,085 --> 00:01:10,086
    Uh, he happened to have     
    been parked across from     
         Burnside Park          

28
00:01:10,088 --> 00:01:12,022
      in front of the old       
   Bank of America building.    

29
00:01:12,024 --> 00:01:13,123
  On this particular morning,   

30
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:14,524
      uh, he was attending      
       a church service.        

31
00:01:14,526 --> 00:01:17,327
  Sometimes he goes there also  
  to meet up with his daughter  

32
00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:19,262
        who's currently         
    in a homeless situation.    

33
00:01:19,264 --> 00:01:22,799
 Uh, so we are hoping that, uh, 
Your Honor could find the reason

34
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:25,168
hopefully to waive this and know
  that we're working actively   

35
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,803
      in terms of keeping       
      this from happening.      

36
00:01:26,805 --> 00:01:28,605
     - Is he homeless now?      

37
00:01:28,607 --> 00:01:30,140
   - Uh, currently speaking,    
    he lives with his father    

38
00:01:30,142 --> 00:01:32,376
at an assisted living residence 
      in East Providence.       

39
00:01:32,378 --> 00:01:34,811
   But, uh, actually, we have   
    an appointment next week    

40
00:01:34,813 --> 00:01:37,280
   with the Gateway group to    
  hopefully line up housing--   

41
00:01:37,282 --> 00:01:39,917
       affordable housing       
      in North Providence.      

42
00:01:39,919 --> 00:01:41,785
  - Tell me about the program.  

43
00:01:41,787 --> 00:01:44,454
       I don't know what        
     the program is about.      

44
00:01:44,456 --> 00:01:46,356
          - Um, we're           
   a social services agency.    

45
00:01:46,358 --> 00:01:48,725
 We're under the Horizon Group. 
     We have two locations.     

46
00:01:48,727 --> 00:01:50,360
       One in Providence,       
  one in Warren, Rhode Island,  

47
00:01:50,362 --> 00:01:52,563
         uh, you know,          
     in the East Bay area.      

48
00:01:52,565 --> 00:01:55,466
Uh, Mr. Holder's been a longtime
  client of ours and whatnot.   

49
00:01:55,468 --> 00:01:58,435
       I've been working        
   as his counselor for about   
     the last nine months.      

50
00:01:58,437 --> 00:02:00,871
       - What's the name        
        of the program?         
     - Riverwood, one word.     

51
00:02:00,873 --> 00:02:02,506
            (Judge)             
 - Are you familiar with that?  

52
00:02:02,508 --> 00:02:03,874
       (Inspector Quinn)        
    - No, but I am familiar     
         with Horizon,          

53
00:02:03,876 --> 00:02:05,876
   uh, I have heard of that.    

54
00:02:05,878 --> 00:02:07,845
- It's basically human services 
        and social work,        

55
00:02:07,847 --> 00:02:09,647
       primarily the role       
   of the Providence program    

56
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:11,849
      is to provide, uh...      

57
00:02:11,851 --> 00:02:13,884
       affordable housing       
  for low-income individuals.   

58
00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:19,457
- Based on your representation, 
     I'm gonna dismiss it.      

59
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:21,225
          - Thank you.          

60
00:02:21,227 --> 00:02:25,596
    - But I want Mr. Holder     
        to know that...         

61
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:27,765
this doesn't give you a license 
     in the future to say,      

62
00:02:27,767 --> 00:02:29,367
     "It's okay, I'll bring     
       my counselor down        

63
00:02:29,369 --> 00:02:31,502
       and I can get out        
  and get way with it", okay?   

64
00:02:31,504 --> 00:02:33,671
      I'm doing this based      
     on his representation.     

65
00:02:33,673 --> 00:02:36,474
    Do you understand that?     

66
00:02:36,476 --> 00:02:38,443
     You explain it to him      
        when he gets out        

67
00:02:38,445 --> 00:02:40,745
  'cause he's homeless, okay?   
           All right.           

68
00:02:40,747 --> 00:02:42,213
- It's our intention to avoid it
      if at all possible.       

69
00:02:42,215 --> 00:02:44,582
     Thank you, Your Honor.     
            - Okay.             

70
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,793
    - I'm just trying to see    
    if he gives me attitude.    

71
00:03:04,471 --> 00:03:06,004
         - Despite what         
      you may be thinking,      

72
00:03:06,006 --> 00:03:07,439
    I believe this motorist     
         actually made          

73
00:03:07,441 --> 00:03:09,574
two wise choices in court today.

74
00:03:09,576 --> 00:03:12,377
  The first having his social   
     worker speak for him.      

75
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:15,280
      Can you imagine what      
  would've happened if he had   
       opened his mouth?        

76
00:03:15,282 --> 00:03:17,482
 I think he'd still be enjoying 
        the hospitality         

77
00:03:17,484 --> 00:03:20,418
      of one of our local       
   correctional institutions.   

78
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,521
       The second is that       
   he waited until he passed    

79
00:03:22,523 --> 00:03:25,857
   Inspector Carignan before    
   he disrespected the Judge.   

80
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:27,492
  Trust me, that may have been  

81
00:03:27,494 --> 00:03:30,896
  the wisest move of his life.  

82
00:03:30,898 --> 00:03:32,998
  - Anthony Michael Giacobbi.   

83
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,633
  Good morning, Mr. Giacobbi.   
      - Good morning, sir.      

84
00:03:34,635 --> 00:03:36,435
- What do your friends call you?
      They call you Tony?       

85
00:03:36,437 --> 00:03:37,970
      They call you A.M.?       
     What do they call you?     

86
00:03:37,972 --> 00:03:40,873
- I can't say what they call me.

87
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:44,777
         (all laughing)         

88
00:03:44,779 --> 00:03:48,113
          - I expected          
    that kind of an answer.     

89
00:03:48,115 --> 00:03:49,381
       You're from, uh...       

90
00:03:49,383 --> 00:03:51,216
  Where are you from, Nevada?   

91
00:03:51,218 --> 00:03:53,352
          - Yes, sir.           
            - Yeah?             

92
00:03:53,354 --> 00:03:54,620
       What are you doing       
        in Rhode Island?        

93
00:03:54,622 --> 00:03:57,423
       - What am I doing?       
  I moved back here, stupidly.  

94
00:03:57,425 --> 00:03:58,991
       (courtroom laughs)       

95
00:03:58,993 --> 00:03:59,992
  - Are you calling me stupid?  

96
00:03:59,994 --> 00:04:02,428
   - I was thinking about it,   
            but I...            

97
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:06,065
         (all laughing)         

98
00:04:06,067 --> 00:04:07,933
       Listen, I'm gonna        
      tell you something.       

99
00:04:07,935 --> 00:04:09,535
        That's not nice.        

100
00:04:09,537 --> 00:04:12,505
      Mr. Giacobbi, uh...       

101
00:04:12,507 --> 00:04:14,907
   You're charged with going    
  through red light on Allens   
  Avenue and Terminal Street.   

102
00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:16,409
    We watching these today?    
      We should watch it.       

103
00:04:16,411 --> 00:04:17,743
             - Yes.             
          - All right.          

104
00:04:17,745 --> 00:04:19,111
  Here's what we're gonna do,   
         Mr. Giacobbi.          

105
00:04:19,113 --> 00:04:20,212
      I'm gonna watch it.       

106
00:04:20,214 --> 00:04:23,482
    Now there are two lines     
       on Allens Avenue.        

107
00:04:23,484 --> 00:04:24,850
   There are two stop lines.    

108
00:04:24,852 --> 00:04:27,954
        If you are past         
      the first stop line       

109
00:04:27,956 --> 00:04:29,989
   when the light turns red,    
        I'll dismiss it.        

110
00:04:29,991 --> 00:04:32,592
     If you're not past it,     
 it's gonna cost you 85 bucks.  

111
00:04:32,594 --> 00:04:35,661
 We're gonna take a look at it. 
         Look up here.          

112
00:04:35,663 --> 00:04:38,664
       (Inspector Quinn)        
   - It's already red, Judge.   
      Show the time light.      

113
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:41,501
           It was r red         
    for 16.2 seconds, Judge.    

114
00:04:41,503 --> 00:04:44,404
     - If I look at this...     

115
00:04:44,406 --> 00:04:47,807
I look at this every day and... 

116
00:04:47,809 --> 00:04:48,975
 I'm supposed to know that when 

117
00:04:48,977 --> 00:04:52,078
  the light clicks three times  
         that it's red.         

118
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,448
     Supposed to know that.     
   I think we're all supposed   
         to know that.          

119
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:58,284
   So, they send me this kind   
 of a video in a court of law.  

120
00:04:58,286 --> 00:05:00,019
    I can't tell what color     
         the light is.          

121
00:05:00,021 --> 00:05:01,554
 I know it changed three times, 
        Inspector Quinn,        

122
00:05:01,556 --> 00:05:03,556
     but it went from white     
       to white to white.       

123
00:05:03,558 --> 00:05:05,458
 - No, it didn't change at all, 
             Judge.             

124
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,995
   It stayed... red according   
         to the notice.         

125
00:05:08,997 --> 00:05:11,932
  But according to the video,   
    I agree with you, Judge.    

126
00:05:11,934 --> 00:05:13,266
    I couldn't determine...     
             - No.              

127
00:05:13,268 --> 00:05:14,601
         The answer is          
       I am not convinced       

128
00:05:14,603 --> 00:05:16,469
    by clear and convincing     
           evidence.            

129
00:05:16,471 --> 00:05:19,372
   They didn't present clear    
 and convincing evidence to me  
    that the light was red.     

130
00:05:19,374 --> 00:05:20,640
 I never saw red on the screen. 

131
00:05:20,642 --> 00:05:22,676
      I saw it all white.       

132
00:05:22,678 --> 00:05:24,411
 I know it changed three times, 
        but I don't know        

133
00:05:24,413 --> 00:05:26,780
  when it changed three times   
       what color it was.       

134
00:05:26,782 --> 00:05:29,983
   That's a very long story.    

135
00:05:29,985 --> 00:05:31,918
     But the result is that     
   I'm gonna dismiss the case   

136
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,888
 because the city has failed to 
 prove by clear and convincing  

137
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,024
     evidence that you went     
      through a red light.      

138
00:05:37,026 --> 00:05:38,292
     Now is there anything      
         you wanna say?         

139
00:05:38,294 --> 00:05:41,128
          - Thank you.          
             - Oh.              

140
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,896
           (laughter)           

141
00:05:42,898 --> 00:05:46,567
       He's never told me       
  what your friends call you.   

142
00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:47,801
 What do you friends call you?  
      They call you Tony?       

143
00:05:47,803 --> 00:05:49,703
     They all you Anthony?      
     What do they call you?     

144

   I guess we had it coming.    

150
00:06:02,218 --> 00:06:03,951
     The Judge did ask him      
          three times           

151
00:06:03,953 --> 00:06:05,586
  what his friends called him.  

152

     Based on his response,     
    we know he wasn't lying.    

153
00:06:08,658 --> 00:06:11,826
 He really is an (bleep) hole.

        - Jose Horentos.        

155
00:06:16,799 --> 00:06:18,599
  - Good morning, Your Honor.   
   - You had a parking ticket   
     on Thayer Street, sir.     

156
00:06:18,601 --> 00:06:20,368
          - Yes, um...          

157
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,703
       That day I wasn't        
        driving the car.        

158
00:06:22,705 --> 00:06:25,139
       I was just getting       
      out of the hospital       

159
00:06:25,141 --> 00:06:26,474
  'cause I had brain surgery.   

160
00:06:26,476 --> 00:06:30,444
  And my son literally parked   
      at the corner of CVS      

161
00:06:30,446 --> 00:06:31,646
     and I got in the car.      

162
00:06:31,648 --> 00:06:33,147
       And the lady said,       
   "You know, you can't park.   

163
00:06:33,149 --> 00:06:35,016
    There's a fire hydrant."    

164
00:06:35,018 --> 00:06:37,952
    And I said, "All right,     
   I understand, I had brain    
 surgery, I had my helmet on."  

165
00:06:37,954 --> 00:06:41,356
And then she says, "Yeah, sure."
 She didn't really believe me.  

166
00:06:41,358 --> 00:06:44,258
  I got in the car, and then,   
       you know, we left.       

167
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,094
    And then I got the mail     
        and the ticket.         

168
00:06:46,096 --> 00:06:48,763
      She didn't even give      
 us a ticket on the windshield  
          or anything.          

169
00:06:48,765 --> 00:06:50,265
- All right, case is dismissed. 

170

      Speak into the mic.       

173
00:06:56,573 --> 00:07:00,508
  - I had brain cancer surgery  
   and then it got infected.    

174
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,177
So they had to remove the bone, 
          like, the...          

175

          - The skull?          

176
00:07:04,648 --> 00:07:05,714
     So, that's why you're      
       wearing a helmet?        

177
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:06,881
         - Helmet, yes.         
            - Yeah?             

178
00:07:06,883 --> 00:07:09,384

           I'm good.

       - The first one...       

234
00:10:33,092 --> 00:10:35,293

  still let him use your car.   

235
00:10:35,295 --> 00:10:36,627
   - Well, I try to be fair.

236
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:37,929
      all these bad things

237
00:10:37,931 --> 00:10:39,464

    you let him use the car.

242
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,908
         - It's because         
   we have a child together.    

243
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,576
    She's grown now, but...

256
00:11:21,008 --> 00:11:23,642
        was to have him         
       pay both of them.        

257
00:11:23,644 --> 00:11:26,545

    who was driving the car     

261
00:11:35,956 --> 00:11:39,458
         then he would

00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,761

        Secret Clinical.        

350
00:15:17,147 --> 00:15:18,580
      Not Secret Clinical.      

351
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:19,915
A single use of Secret Clinical 

352
00:15:19,983 --> 00:15:21,249
    is the same as two uses     

353
00:15:21,318 --> 00:15:22,918
of the leading invisible solid. 

354
00:15:22,986 --> 00:15:24,419
  Twice the sweat protection,   

355
00:15:24,488 --> 00:16:10,666
        Secret Clinical.        

356
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:14,236
    I had been diagnosed with   
    Stage 4 prostate cancer.    

357
00:16:14,305 --> 00:16:16,105
     I serve in the general     
      assembly and we work      

358
00:16:16,174 --> 00:16:18,741
    together across the aisle   
       to get things done.      

359
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,509
       And that's the way       
         it is at CTCA.         

360
00:16:20,578 --> 00:16:22,511
      What Fred needed was      
       a management team.       

361
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,081
       Not just to have a       
     long-term strategy for     

362
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:27,550
      quantity of life, but     
     also an active strategy    

363
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:28,985
      for quality of life.      

364
00:16:29,053 --> 00:16:31,287
    My PSA is under control.    

365
00:16:31,356 --> 00:16:34,424
         CTCA gave me an        
    opportunity to accomplish   

366
00:16:34,492 --> 00:16:36,159
     my goals and my dreams.

370
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:42,865
          - Francesca?          

371
00:16:44,402 --> 00:16:45,768
            - Hello.            

372
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:50,173
      - Your motor vehicle      

373
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,274
        has been booted.        

374
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:53,443
             - Yes.             

375
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:55,178
 - And you came to court on...  

376
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,346
     - Last year sometime.      

377
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:59,015
    - November of last year.    
             - Yes.             

378
00:16:59,017 --> 00:17:02,452
       - Your fine was...       
        (clears throat)         

379
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:05,655
             $980.              

380
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:08,558
             - Yes.             

381
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,727
      I missed my-- okay.       
          - I told you          

382
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:14,631
         at that point          

383
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:17,267
 that I would release the boot  

384
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:19,269
   if you paid $20 a week...    

385
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:21,304
        - Yeah, that was        
        on my mom's car.        

386
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:23,039
        - For 30 weeks.         
             - Yes.             

387
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,909
        - Which is $300.        
           - Mm-hmm.            

388
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:28,278
     - So, I... said to you     

389
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,916
         that you could         

390
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:36,720
pay the $20 a week for 15 weeks 
    and that if you did that    

391
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,655
      that I would dismiss      

392
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:43,527
  the entire balance of $660.   
             - Yes.             

393
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,896
    - You solemnly promised     
    that you would do that.     

394
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,065
          Absolutely,           
       thank you, Judge.        

395
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:51,068
   I will do that every week,   
  and I told you at that point  

396
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,504
    that we have not changed    
     our phone number here.     

397
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:56,006
  That if there was any reason  
     why you couldn't pay,      

398
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:57,307
     that you should call.      

399
00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:00,044
  So, you made three payments   

400
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:02,479
and never made another payment. 

401
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:03,847
    - I made more than three    
           payments.            

402
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:05,215
   - You made three payments.   

403
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:06,784
             So...              
  - Some of them were for 40.   

404
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:10,588
        And a few, like,        
        I think, for 60.        
   - You made three payments.   

405
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,924
- In January, I got evicted from
 my apartment, so after that... 

406
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,426
      - We haven't changed      
       our phone number.        

407
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:18,395
      - Okay... I'm sorry.      

408
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:21,365
     - So, all I'm telling      
          you is that           

409
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:25,503
      any representations       
  you made to the court today   

410
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:27,805
       I will be suspect        

411
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:30,307
    whether or not you will     
     keep your word because     

412
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:33,611
 you broke your word last time  
  after I bent over backwards   

413
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:34,812
    to give you a big break.    

414
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:40,318
  - So, what do you wanna say?  

415
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,154
     - First, I'm terribly      
          sorry and...          

416
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:44,422
 - No, I don't wanna hear that. 

417
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:47,091
   - Okay, well, in January,    
     I was-- I got evicted      

418
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:50,027
 from my place, and I was going 
through a lot with my two kids. 

419
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:52,029
 - Listen, the fact that-- that 
   fact of the matter is that   

420
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,499
   if the car wasn't booted,    
  you wouldn't come down here.  

421
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:55,833
  You know the car was booted.  

422
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:58,803
 You know you were saving $620. 

423
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,772
     All you had to do was      
      pay the $20 a week.       

424
00:19:00,774 --> 00:19:02,206
        You didn't do it.       

425
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,676
       You didn't do it,        
        you didn't call.        

426
00:19:04,678 --> 00:19:05,943
         We understand.         
    People call all the time    

427
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:08,279
  and say, "Listen, something   
    happened, I can't pay."     

428
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:09,814
        We say, "Okay."         

429
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:12,951
    But we... we, at least--    
   They at least contact us.    

430
00:19:12,953 --> 00:19:16,154
But you just didn't contact us. 

431
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:17,522
 I don't know what you thought. 

432
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:19,424
- After speaking with the Judge,

433
00:19:19,426 --> 00:19:21,960
     I wanted 400 in order      
      to release the boot.      

434
00:19:21,962 --> 00:19:24,229
        There's a little        
        issue with that.        

435
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:27,899
  So, the Judge has said we're  
gonna release the boot on $200. 

436
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:30,068
     And we'll put you back     
    on the $20 payment plan.    

437
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,669
   But I can assure you this.   

438
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,939
 If you don't adhere to the $20 
      payment plan a week,      

439
00:19:34,941 --> 00:19:36,875
      next time you're not      
     gonna get the car back     

440
00:19:36,877 --> 00:19:38,977
unless it's a substantial amount
  of money back for the city.   

441
00:19:38,979 --> 00:19:42,914
   So the Judge, once again,    
  is bending completely over.   

442
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,215
           Last time,           
    he bent over backwards.     

443
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:46,518
      Right now he's head       
       over heels, so...        

444
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,854
         You gotta help         
    the court a little bit.     

445
00:19:48,856 --> 00:19:51,122
          - Francesca?          
             - Yes.             

446
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:54,926
     - If I followed normal     
        protocol on this        

447
00:19:54,928 --> 00:19:57,229
        you would end up        
          with no car.          

448
00:19:57,231 --> 00:19:59,898
       Because if I don't       
       release the boot,        

449
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,267
    the car will get towed.     

450
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:05,837
     If the car gets towed,     
       you will then owe        

451
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:08,407
all this money which is $1,080. 

452
00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:10,642
       And then you will        
      owe the tow company       

453
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:13,111
approximately $100 for the tow. 

454
00:20:13,113 --> 00:20:14,680
      And then they charge      
       storage every day.       

455
00:20:14,682 --> 00:20:16,748
             - Yes.             
       - So, effectively,       

456
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,951
    what I would be doing is    

457
00:20:18,953 --> 00:20:20,752
       I would be taking        
    your car away from you.     

458
00:20:20,754 --> 00:20:23,989
   I know you have children.    
     I don't wanna do that.     

459
00:20:23,991 --> 00:20:26,225
         But I want you         
    to show some good faith.    

460
00:20:26,227 --> 00:20:29,695
             - Yes.             
     - Okay, so I'm trying      
          to help you.          

461
00:20:29,697 --> 00:20:31,764
       Now all I'm asking       
   is that you help yourself.   

462
00:20:31,766 --> 00:20:33,399
          - Thank you.          

463
00:20:33,401 --> 00:20:35,801
       - Inspector Quinn        
        explained to you        

464
00:20:35,803 --> 00:20:39,638
      I'm gonna hold back       
    on having the car towed.    

465
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,007
    I'm gonna leave the boot    
       on until tomorrow.       

466
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:44,043
    I will be here tomorrow.    
            - Okay.             

467
00:20:44,045 --> 00:20:48,213
    - Come in and hopefully     
   we can get this resolved.    

468
00:20:48,215 --> 00:20:49,615
    Do you understand that?     
             - Yes.             

469
00:20:49,617 --> 00:20:51,050
 - All right, good luck to you. 

470
00:20:52,954 --> 00:20:53,886
          - Thank you.          

471
00:23:59,442 --> 00:24:01,508
       - Gregory Gautier.       

472
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,611
       Good morning, sir.       
  - Good morning, Your Honor.   

473
00:24:05,348 --> 00:24:06,780
 - You have four tickets, sir.  

474
00:24:06,782 --> 00:24:08,516
        Uh... let's see.        

475
00:24:08,518 --> 00:24:12,086
     Two on Westminster...      
  Exchange and Atwells Avenue.  

476
00:24:12,088 --> 00:24:14,288
        - The three most        
       current ones, um,        

477
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:17,324
  is parked around the streets  

478
00:24:17,326 --> 00:24:21,562
  that surround One Financial   
  Plaza which is where I work.  

479
00:24:21,564 --> 00:24:24,331
          I'm guilty.           
   I had to run in, run out.    

480
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:27,168
Sometimes I got delayed, so I'm 
  guilty at that, Your Honor.   

481
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:29,403
          - All right.          
       - I was wondering        
       if I could, uh...        

482
00:24:29,405 --> 00:24:30,871
     - Waive the penalties?     
  - Yes, sir, yes, Your Honor.  

483
00:24:30,873 --> 00:24:32,173
   - I think we can do that.    

484
00:24:32,175 --> 00:24:35,109
  - The one on Atwells Avenue   
     goes back a few years.     

485
00:24:35,111 --> 00:24:37,211
  And it was, uh, in December.  

486
00:24:37,213 --> 00:24:41,482
    And the, um, it was, uh,    
     around Christmastime.      

487
00:24:41,484 --> 00:24:43,250
    I was up there for lunch    
    and I didn't see the...     

488
00:24:43,252 --> 00:24:45,886
   - Where did we have lunch?   
     - I-- what did I have?     

489
00:24:45,888 --> 00:24:48,389
          - No, where?          
- Oh, Venda Ravioli, Your Honor.

490
00:24:48,391 --> 00:24:50,424
- Do you remember what you had? 

491
00:24:50,426 --> 00:24:52,159
            - Uh...             

492
00:24:52,161 --> 00:24:54,061
         No, I do not.          

493
00:24:54,063 --> 00:24:57,031
- Judge, if he said corned beef,
I was gonna think he was lying. 

494
00:24:57,033 --> 00:24:59,667
         (all laughing)         

495
00:25:03,239 --> 00:25:05,206
  - Yeah, that got some pretty  
     good dishes up there.      

496
00:25:05,208 --> 00:25:06,440
            - Uh...             
 - You know, I mean, they make  

497
00:25:06,442 --> 00:25:09,143
         the ravioli--          
       They're homemade.        

498
00:25:09,145 --> 00:25:11,112
     I was born and raised      
         in that area.          

499
00:25:11,114 --> 00:25:13,047
         And many times         
     people will say to me,     

500
00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:15,283
    "What's the best Italian    
     restaurant up there?"      

501
00:25:15,285 --> 00:25:17,418
    And the answer is there     
    were several good ones.     

502
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:19,320
       I have a personal        
      preference which I,       

503
00:25:19,322 --> 00:25:23,691
    I don't feel at liberty     
       to, uh, disclose.        

504
00:25:23,693 --> 00:25:27,795
      But Italians really       
    gauge a restaurant on...    

505
00:25:27,797 --> 00:25:31,065
     on their pasta and...      

506
00:25:31,067 --> 00:25:32,266
   And they really-- and then   
   it goes further than that.   

507
00:25:32,268 --> 00:25:34,268
 They gauge it on their gravy.  

508
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:38,206
  Now Italians call red sauce,  
         gravy, right?          

509
00:25:38,208 --> 00:25:39,641
         Everyone else,         
    when I talk about gravy,    

510
00:25:39,643 --> 00:25:41,309
     they think I'm talking     
    about something you put     

511
00:25:41,311 --> 00:25:43,778
    on chicken or something     
     over mashed potatoes.      

512
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,914
    Right, Inspector Quinn?     
       - No, Your Honor.        

513
00:25:45,916 --> 00:25:48,016
       I'm familiar with        
      the red gravy also.       

514
00:25:48,018 --> 00:25:49,884
        - It's obvious.         

515
00:25:49,886 --> 00:25:53,755
           (laughter)           

516
00:25:53,757 --> 00:25:55,023
          (chuckling)           
          - All right.          

517
00:25:55,025 --> 00:25:58,126
I'm aware of the decorations up 
    there at Christmastime.     

518
00:25:58,128 --> 00:26:00,295
     As a matter of fact...     

519
00:26:00,297 --> 00:26:02,831
  I've often wondered why more  
   tickets don't go out there   

520
00:26:02,833 --> 00:26:04,499
   on the Christmas vacation    
      'cause they do have       

521
00:26:04,501 --> 00:26:06,434
decorations all over the place. 

522
00:26:06,436 --> 00:26:08,703
    All right, so I'm gonna     
 dismiss that ticket, it's $90. 

523
00:26:08,705 --> 00:26:10,305
    - Thank you, Your Honor.    
    - All right, good luck.     

524
00:26:15,912 --> 00:26:16,377
    All right, so I'm gonna     
 dismiss that ticket, it's $90. 

525
00:26:16,446 --> 00:26:17,445
                         Got it?

526
00:26:17,514 --> 00:26:18,646
            Got it.             

527
00:26:18,715 --> 00:26:20,415
           Nooooo...            

528
00:26:20,484 --> 00:26:22,517
           Nooooo...            

529
00:26:22,586 --> 00:26:24,519
<i>Quick, the Quicker Picker Upper!</i>

530
00:26:24,588 --> 00:26:27,956
 <i> Bounty picks up messes quicker</i>
 <i> and is 2x more absorbent.</i>     

531
00:26:28,024 --> 00:26:29,958
   <i> Bounty, the Quicker Picker</i>  
   <i> Upper.</i>                      

532
00:27:15,905 --> 00:27:20,208
If only there was a place nearby
  you could get one of these.   

533
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,109
            Or these.           

534
00:27:22,112 --> 00:27:23,845
       Good thing they're       
         sold literally         

535
00:27:23,847 --> 00:27:25,981
  everywhere business is done.  

536
00:27:25,983 --> 00:27:28,483
    I'm pretty sure you could   
       buy them at a bank.      

537
00:27:28,485 --> 00:27:29,551
           Not Sorry.           

538
00:27:29,553 --> 00:27:30,385
            Reese's.            

539
00:27:47,237 --> 00:27:49,938
So, when you leave, you tell him

540
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,406
   that I was gonna fine him    

541
00:27:51,408 --> 00:27:52,708
    the full amount and that    

542
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:55,544
       your argument was        
     so compelling, right,      

543
00:27:55,546 --> 00:27:58,480
     that you beat me down,     
   and I dismissed the case.    

544
00:27:58,482 --> 00:27:59,915
So, that he will owe you, right?

545
00:27:59,917 --> 00:28:02,351
  Should buy you a nice gift.   

546
00:28:02,353 --> 00:28:04,119
You can tell him when you leave.
            - Okay.             

547
00:28:04,121 --> 00:28:05,887
       - That way you can       
       exaggerate, okay?        

548
00:28:05,889 --> 00:28:07,789
