 on its own...                  

1141
00:40:24,254 --> 00:40:26,821
     Or I can talk to

   You didn't choose to have    
   endometriosis...             

1143
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:29,858
   but you can choose to ask    

1144
00:40:29,893 --> 00:40:31,593
 if ORILISSA is right for you.  

1145
00:40:31,628 --> 00:40:33,528
    ORILISSA is specifically    
    developed for women         

1146
00:40:33,563 --> 00:40:36,164
    with moderate to severe     
    endometriosis pain.         

1147
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:37,198
      In clinical trials,       

1148
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:39,668
ORILISSA was proven to reduce 3 
common types of                 

1149
00:40:39,703 --> 00:40:40,936
      endometriosis pain,       

1150
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:41,836
        painful periods,        

1151
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:43,238
     pelvic pain in between     
     periods,                   

1152
00:40:43,273 --> 00:40:44,739
       and pain with sex.       

1153
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,908
Don't use ORILISSA if you are or
may be pregnant,                

1154
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:47,976
       have osteoporosis,       

1155
00:40:48,011 --> 00:40:50,378
  severe liver disease, or are  
  taking drugs like             

1156
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:52,380
  cyclosporine or gemfibrozil.  

1157
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:54,282
     It may cause abnormal      
     liver tests.               

1158
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:56,551
    ORILISSA may change your    
    periods, making it hard     

1159
00:40:56,586 --> 00:40:58,119
  to know if you are pregnant.  

1160
00:40:58,155 --> 00:40:59,554
 It does not prevent pregnancy. 

1161
00:40:59,589 --> 00:41:02,123
Use birth control that does not 
contain hormones.               

1162
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:04,726
  ORILISSA may cause suicidal   
  thoughts or actions.          

1163
00:41:04,761 --> 00:41:07,595
  It may also cause bone loss.  

1164
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:10,532
   Ask your gynecologist if     
   ORILISSA is right for you.

00:41:10,567 --> 00:41:12,334
