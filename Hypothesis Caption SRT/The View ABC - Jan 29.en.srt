  MEDICINE TO TREAT DIABETES,   

466
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,499
 OR IF YOU HAVE TYPE 1 DIABETES 

467
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:30,434
   OR DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS.    

468
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:32,503
     DON'T TAKE TRULICITY       
     IF YOU OR YOUR FAMILY      

469
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:34,438
 HAVE MEDULLARY THYROID CANCER, 

470
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:35,773
 YOU'RE ALLERGIC TO TRULICITY,  

471
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:38,676
   OR HAVE MULTIPLE ENDOCRINE   
   NEOPLASIA SYNDROME TYPE 2.   

472
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:41,278
    STOP TRULICITY AND CALL     
    YOUR DOCTOR RIGHT AWAY      

473
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:43,814
   IF YOU HAVE SYMPTOMS OF A    
   SERIOUS ALLERGIC REACTION,   

474
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,349
A LUMP OR SWELLING IN YOUR NECK,

475
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:46,851
    OR SEVERE STOMACH PAIN.     

476
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,553
    SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS MAY    
    INCLUDE PANCREATITIS.       

477
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:52,356
    TAKING TRULICITY WITH A     
    SULFONYLUREA OR INSULIN     

478
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:54,291
       INCREASES YOUR LOW       
       BLOOD SUGAR RISK.        

479
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,328
  COMMON SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE   
  NAUSEA, DIARRHEA, VOMITING,   

480
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,463
      ABDOMINAL PAIN, AND       
      DECREASED APPETITE.       

481
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:01,098
 THESE CAN LEAD TO DEHYDRATION, 

482
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:02,633
        WHICH MAY WORSEN        
        KIDNEY PROBLEMS.

00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:11,242
     ASK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT      
     ONCE-WEEKLY TRULICITY.     

486
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,678
       60% of women wear        
       the wrong size pad       

487
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:16,514

    coverage day or night.      

492
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:24,188
    Because better coverage     

493
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:25,689
    means better protection.
