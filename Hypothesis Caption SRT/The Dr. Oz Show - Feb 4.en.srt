REASON FOR THAT, I BELIEVE, IS  

543
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,432
REASON FOR THAT, I BELIEVE, IS  
BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THAT, YOU    

544
00:16:06,434 --> 00:16:08,501
BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THAT, YOU

I WAS ALREADY INVOLVED WITH HIM

AND I SAW HIS BEHAVIOR WITH ME, 

909
00:30:21,742 --> 00:30:22,841
AND I SAW HIS BEHAVIOR WITH ME, 
HOW CONTROLLING IT WAS.         

910
00:30:22,843 --> 00:30:24,776

AND HE WAS TRYING TO MAKE IT    

921
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:43,094
AND HE WAS TRYING TO MAKE IT    
NORMAL TO ME.                   

922
00:30:43,096 --> 00:30:43,528
NORMAL TO ME.                   
THAT'S SCARY.                   

923
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:46,164
THAT'S SCARY.                   
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY WHY --  

924
00:30:46,166 --> 00:30:47,298
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY WHY --  
WHY YOU DIDN'T TRY TO HELP      

925
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:47,599
WHY YOU DIDN'T TRY TO HELP      
THEM?                           

926
00:30:47,601 --> 00:30:49,434
THEM?                           
YOU KNOW AND I'M -- I COULDN'T

00:30:49,436 --> 00:30:51,436
YOU KNOW AND I'M -- I COULDN'T  
HELP THEM IF I CAN HELP MYSELF. 

928
00:30:51,438 --> 00:30:53,404
HELP THEM IF I CAN HELP MYSELF. 
SO I HAVE TO COME TO TERMS AND  

929
00:30:53,406 --> 00:30:53,738
SO I HAVE TO COME TO TERMS AND  
ACCEPT.                         

930
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:56,508
ACCEPT.                         
AND I DON'T COME FROM A FAMILY  

931
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:58,376
AND I DON'T COME FROM A FAMILY  
OF ABUSE.                       

932
00:30:58,378 --> 00:31:00,378
OF ABUSE.                       
I DON'T -- I'VE NEVER HAD TO GO 

933
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,512
I DON'T -- I'VE NEVER HAD TO GO 
THROUGH ANYTHING LIKE THIS.     

934
00:31:01,514 --> 00:31:02,580
THROUGH ANYTHING LIKE THIS.     
SO WHEN IT'S IN FRONT OF YOU    

935
00:31:02,582 --> 00:31:03,648
SO WHEN IT'S IN FRONT OF YOU

00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:05,650
AND NEVER HAPPENED TO YOU, YOU

00:31:05,652 --> 00:31:06,784
HAVE TO REALLY PROCESS AND      
UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT WHAT'S

939
00:31:08,688 --> 00:31:11,589
GOING ON IN FRONT OF YOU.       
SO WAS THERE CULT BEHAVIOR?     

940
00:31:11,591 --> 00:31:11,989
SO WAS THERE CULT BEHAVIOR?     
ABSOLUTELY.                     

941
00:31:11,991 --> 00:31:12,824

HAVING TO USE THE BATHROOM,     

942
00:31:12,826 --> 00:31:14,659
HAVING TO USE THE BATHROOM,     
HAVING TO ASK PERMISSION TO

HAVING TO ASK PERMISSION TO     
EAT, I CAN REMEMBER I WALKED    

944
00:31:16,796 --> 00:31:17,795

INTO A HOTEL.                   

945
00:31:17,797 --> 00:31:18,930
INTO A HOTEL.                   
AND THEY DIDN'T EVEN ASK FOR MY

AND THEY DIDN'T EVEN ASK FOR MY 
NAME.                           

947
00:31:19,232 --> 00:31:20,031
NAME.                           
THEY KNEW WHO I WAS.            

948
00:31:20,033 --> 00:31:21,866
THEY KNEW WHO I WAS.            
AND THEY WALKED ME UP TO MY     

949
00:31:21,868 --> 00:31:22,833

950
00:31:22,835 --> 00:31:23,901
ROOM.                           
NO HOTEL THAT I'VE EVER BEEN TO 

951
00:31:23,903 --> 00:31:25,102
NO HOTEL THAT I'VE EVER BEEN TO 
HAS DONE THAT.                  

952
00:31:25,104 --> 00:31:27,204
HAS DONE THAT.

SO THINGS LIKE THAT DEFINITELY  
WERE RED FLAGS.

WAS ACCEPTING WHAT I HAD GONE   

970
00:31:56,602 --> 00:31:57,701
WAS ACCEPTING WHAT I HAD GONE   
THROUGH, ACKNOWLEDGING IT'S

WRONG.                          

972
00:31:58,004 --> 00:31:59,670
WRONG.                          
BUT WHERE I WENT WRONG IS I

00:31:59,672 --> 00:32:00,738
BUT WHERE I WENT WRONG IS I

00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,005
THOUGHT THAT I COULD TALK TO    
HIM.

00:32:02,174 --> 00:32:03,841
HIM.                            
I THOUGHT THAT I COULD MAYBE    

978
00:32:03,843 --> 00:32:04,942
I THOUGHT THAT I COULD MAYBE    
MAKE HIM DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT 

979
00:32:04,944 --> 00:32:05,876
MAKE HIM DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT 
IN ME.                          

980
00:32:05,878 --> 00:32:06,844
IN ME.                          
AND YOU'RE NO DIFFERENT.        

981
00:32:06,846 --> 00:32:07,945
AND YOU'RE NO DIFFERENT.        
HE'S NOT GOING TO LOOK AT YOU   

982
00:32:07,947 --> 00:32:09,046
HE'S NOT GOING TO LOOK AT YOU   
ANY DIFFERENT BECAUSE THIS IS   

983
00:32:09,048 --> 00:32:10,047
ANY DIFFERENT BECAUSE THIS IS   
WHAT HE'S DONE FOR YEARS.       

984
00:32:10,049 --> 00:32:12,149
WHAT HE'S DONE FOR YEARS.       
SO WHAT MAKES YOU SO SPECIAL?   

985
00:32:12,151 --> 00:32:15,052
SO WHAT MAKES YOU SO SPECIAL?   
SO FOR ME, I REALLY HAD TO LOOK

00:32:15,054 --> 00:32:17,254
SO FOR ME, I REALLY HAD TO LOOK 
INSIDE OF MYSELF AND THINK BACK 

987
00:32:17,256 --> 00:32:20,157
INSIDE OF MYSELF AND THINK BACK 
TO THE WAY MY PARENTS HAVE      

988
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:20,524
TO THE WAY MY PARENTS HAVE      
RAISED ME.

I HAVE NO BUSINESS DEALING WITH 
SOMEBODY THREE TIMES MY AGE.    

991
00:32:23,262 --> 00:32:24,561
SOMEBODY THREE TIMES MY AGE.    
THAT'S SOMETHING I SHOULDN'T    

992
00:32:24,563 --> 00:32:27,230
THAT'S SOMETHING I SHOULDN'T    
HAVE DID.

EVEN BEING INVOLVED WITH HIM.

1354
00:45:08,322 --> 00:45:10,388

00:45:11,391 --> 00:45:11,790
I DON'T NEED PERSONAL           
ENRICHMENT.                     

1357
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,558
ENRICHMENT.                     
I COME FROM A FAMILY OF HARD    

1358
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:14,626
I COME FROM A FAMILY OF HARD    
WORKING PARENTS WHO HAVE BEEN

00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:16,494
WORKING PARENTS WHO HAVE BEEN

BE CLEAR, WHEN HE WAS SEEING    

1363
00:45:20,734 --> 00:45:22,600
BE CLEAR, WHEN HE WAS SEEING    
ME, HE WOULD ASK ME WHO'S

SO I NEVER NEEDED YOU FOR       
ANYTHING.

1369
00:45:29,042 --> 00:45:31,710
DENIED HE SENT THAT LETTER.     
BUT ANYWAY, IT WAS SENT AFTER

THE LAWSUIT WAS FILED.

1372
00:45:34,715 --> 00:45:36,981
BUT THE POINT IS THIS.          
WE DO FEEL THAT THERE HAS BEEN

00:45:36,983 --> 00:45:37,382
WE DO FEEL THAT THERE HAS BEEN  
RETALIATION.                    

1374

FAITH FROM PROCEEDING.          

1376
00:45:42,122 --> 00:45:44,989
FAITH FROM PROCEEDING.          
AND SHE'S NOT GOING TO BE       

1377
00:45:44,991 --> 00:45:45,390
AND SHE'S NOT GOING TO BE       
INTIMIDATED.                    

1378
00:45:45,392 --> 00:45:48,059
INTIMIDATED.                    
SHE IS -- SPEAKING THE TRUTH IN 

1379
00:45:48,061 --> 00:45:49,260
SHE IS -- SPEAKING THE TRUTH IN 
THIS CASE, THE POWER OF MR.     

1380
00:45:49,262 --> 00:45:51,262
THIS CASE, THE POWER OF MR.     
KELLY AND SHE HAS STRONG        

1381
00:45:51,264 --> 00:45:53,098
KELLY AND SHE HAS STRONG        
SUPPORT FOR HER PARENTS, STRONG 

1382
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:54,299
SUPPORT FOR HER PARENTS, STRONG 
SUPPORT FROM HER LAWYERS.       

1383
00:45:54,301 --> 00:45:55,500
SUPPORT FROM HER LAWYERS.       
AND WE'RE GOING FORWARD.        

1384
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:57,335
AND WE'RE GOING FORWARD.        
AND THE FACT THAT HE'S A        

1385
00:45:57,337 --> 00:45:58,603
AND THE FACT THAT HE'S A        
CELEBRITY DOESN'T MEAN THAT HE  

1386
00:45:58,605 --> 00:46:00,305
CELEBRITY DOESN'T MEAN THAT HE  
IS ABOVE THE LAW.               

1387
00:46:00,307 --> 00:46:01,473
IS ABOVE THE LAW.               
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT HE HAS A   

1388
00:46:01,475 --> 00:46:03,508
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT HE HAS A   
LICENSE TO GO AND HURT PEOPLE.  

1389
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:05,610
LICENSE TO GO AND HURT PEOPLE.  
ANY MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE DOES. 

1390
00:46:05,612 --> 00:46:06,644
ANY MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE DOES. 
SO THAT'S WHY SHE IS            

1391
00:46:06,646 --> 00:46:07,479
SO THAT'S WHY SHE IS            
PROCEEDING.                     

1392
00:46:07,481 --> 00:46:09,481

PAINFUL IT IS FOR HER, YOU      

1394
00:46:10,784 --> 00:46:11,816
PAINFUL IT IS FOR HER, YOU      
KNOW, TO HAVE TO EVEN TALK      

1395
00:46:11,818 --> 00:46:12,684
KNOW, TO HAVE TO EVEN TALK      
ABOUT THIS.                     

1396
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:14,652
ABOUT THIS.                     
BUT SHE IS ONE COURAGEOUS YOUNG 

1397
00:46:14,654 --> 00:46:14,953
BUT SHE IS ONE COURAGEOUS YOUNG 
WOMAN.                          

1398
00:46:14,955 --> 00:46:16,821
WOMAN.                          
AND I APPLAUD HER FOR IT.

1401

DR. OZ: UP NEXT, CAN MORE WOMEN 
BE AT RISK AND WHAT CAN PARENTS 

1402
00:46:21,228 --> 00:46:22,994
BE AT RISK AND WHAT CAN PARENTS 
DO TO PREBT THEIR DAUGHTERS?    

1403
00:46:22,996 --> 00:46:23,895
DO TO PREBT THEIR DAUGHTERS?    
A PLEA YOU HAVE TO HEAR.        

1404
00:46:23,897 --> 00:46:25,830
A PLEA YOU HAVE TO HEAR.        
THAT IS NEXT.                   

1405
00:46:25,832 --> 00:46:42,080
THAT IS NEXT.                   
[APPLAUSE]                      

1406
00:47:05,638 --> 00:47:07,305
     When you feed yourself     
           some oats,           

1407
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:09,174
 the oats feed your body fiber. 

1408
00:47:09,209 --> 00:47:11,810
    Fiber helps keep things     
  moving through your system.   

1409
00:47:11,845 --> 00:47:12,711
        Which is great.         

1410
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:14,713
    Because when you're good    
        to your system,         

1411
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:16,748
     it'll be good to you.      

1412
00:47:20,553 --> 00:47:22,120
         Ok I'll admit.         

1413
00:47:22,155 --> 00:47:23,121
    I didn't keep my place      
    as clean as I would like    

1414
00:47:23,156 --> 00:47:24,756
     'cuz I'm way too busy.     

1415
00:47:24,791 --> 00:47:27,459
Who's got the time to chase     
around down dirt, dust and hair?

1416
00:47:27,494 --> 00:47:28,393
            So now,             

1417
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:30,929
    I use Heavy Duty Swiffer    
    Sweeper and Dusters.        

1418
00:47:30,964 --> 00:47:32,263
   For hard-to-reach places,    

1419
00:47:32,299 --> 00:47:34,265
 Duster makes it easy to clean. 

1420
00:47:34,301 --> 00:47:36,434
It captures dust in one swipe.  

1421
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:37,969
          Ha! Gotcha!           

1422
00:47:38,638 --> 00:47:40,438
               And (New) Sweeper
               Heavy Duty cloths

1423
00:47:40,474 --> 00:47:42,607
            lock away a twice as
            much dirt and dust. 

1424
00:47:42,642 --> 00:47:45,343
 It gets stuff deep in the      
 grooves other tools can miss.  

1425
00:47:45,379 --> 00:47:46,311
         You know what?         

1426
00:47:46,346 --> 00:47:48,279
My place is a lot cleaner now.  

1427
00:47:48,315 --> 00:47:49,114
         Stop cleaning.         

1428
00:47:49,149 --> 00:47:49,981
       Start Swiffering.
