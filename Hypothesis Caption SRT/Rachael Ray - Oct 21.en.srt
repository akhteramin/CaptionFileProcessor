951
00:43:19,896 --> 00:43:22,697
  But, really I'm struggling to 
   keep up this brave face...   

952
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:25,767
       to hide my symptoms      
         of depression.         

953
00:43:26,736 --> 00:43:29,671
  I'm taking my antidepressant

954
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:31,506
     But, I'm still feeling

       antidepressant,...       

960
00:43:42,218 --> 00:43:45,853
 REXULTI has been proven to help
 reduce symptoms of depression. 

961
00:43:46,222 --> 00:43:48,456
   So I can stay on my current

962
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:50,224

 Now, I'm glad I talked with my

986
00:44:46,649 --> 00:44:47,548
    I was on the fence about    
    changing                    

987
00:44:47,584 --> 00:44:49,751

988
00:44:49,786 --> 00:44:51,519
  But my hygienist said going   
  electric                      

989
00:44:51,554 --> 00:44:53,121
could lead to way cleaner teeth.

990
00:44:53,156 --> 00:44:55,523
 She said, get the one inspired

00:44:55,558 --> 00:44:56,824
