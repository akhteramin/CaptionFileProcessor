  Guys do whatever it takes to  
  deal with shave irritation.   

1210
00:53:11,973 --> 00:53:15,357
So, we re-imagined the razor    
with the new Gillette SkinGuard.

1211
00:53:16,811 --> 00:53:19,344
     It has a unique guard      
     between the blades.        

1212

  That's designed to reduce     
  irritation during the shave.  

1213
00:53:23,985 --> 00:53:27,987
 Because we believe all men     
 deserve a razor just for them.
