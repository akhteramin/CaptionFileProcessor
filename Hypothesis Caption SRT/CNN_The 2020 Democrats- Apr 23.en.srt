00:29:06,938 --> 00:29:08,304
      Is it that obvious?       

827
00:29:08,339 --> 00:29:09,572
           Yes it is.           

828
00:29:09,607 --> 00:29:12,008
You know, maybe you'd worry less
 if you got GEICO to help with  

829
00:29:12,043 --> 00:29:13,576
   your homeowners insurance.   

830

I didn't know GEICO could helps 
   with homeowners insurance.

WHICH MADE IT EASY FOR HIM.     

1430
00:52:31,415 --> 00:52:33,549

THE OTHER WAY THERE'S NO DOUBT  

1431
00:52:33,551 --> 00:52:35,184
THE OTHER WAY THERE'S NO DOUBT  
THAT THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE IN

HARRIS IS SAYING THAT'S THE     

1444
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:02,010
HARRIS IS SAYING THAT'S THE     
WRONG WAY TO GO.                

1445
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:06,382
WRONG WAY TO GO.                
>> THIS STOOD OUT TO YOU.       

1446
00:53:06,384 --> 00:53:08,217

SO SENATOR WARREN WAS ASKED WHY 

1447
00:53:08,219 --> 00:53:09,985
SO SENATOR WARREN WAS ASKED WHY 
SHE SHIFTED FROM BEING          

1448
00:53:09,987 --> 00:53:10,819
SHE SHIFTED FROM BEING          
REPUBLICAN TO DEMOCRAT.         

1449
00:53:10,821 --> 00:53:12,821
REPUBLICAN TO DEMOCRAT.         
SHE TALKED ABOUT HER EXPERIENCE 

1450
00:53:12,823 --> 00:53:14,323
SHE TALKED ABOUT HER EXPERIENCE 
WORKING ON BANKRUPTCY AND HERE'S

1451
00:53:14,325 --> 00:53:16,358
WORKING ON BANKRUPTCY AND HERE'S
HOW SHE LAID IT OUT.            

1452
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:19,795
HOW SHE LAID IT OUT.            
>> BY THE END OF THAT FIGHT I   

1453
00:53:19,797 --> 00:53:21,764
>> BY THE END OF THAT FIGHT I   
PULLY UNDERSTOOD THAT EVERY     

1454
00:53:21,766 --> 00:53:23,098
PULLY UNDERSTOOD THAT EVERY     
SINGLE REPUBLICAN STOOD THERE   

1455
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:25,301
SINGLE REPUBLICAN STOOD THERE   
FROM THE BANK AND HALF OF THE   

1456
00:53:25,303 --> 00:53:26,602
FROM THE BANK AND HALF OF THE   
DEMOCRATS DID.                  

1457
00:53:26,604 --> 00:53:28,837
DEMOCRATS DID.                  
SO MY PARTY WAS THE PARTY THAT  

1458
00:53:28,839 --> 00:53:31,240
SO MY PARTY WAS THE PARTY THAT  
HAT LEAST WE GOT HALF OF THEM TO

1459
00:53:31,242 --> 00:53:32,775
HAT LEAST WE GOT HALF OF THEM TO
STAND UP FOR WORKING PEOPLE.    

1460
00:53:32,777 --> 00:53:39,815
STAND UP FOR WORKING PEOPLE.    
THAT WAS A BIG CHANGE FOR ME.   

1461
00:53:39,817 --> 00:53:41,817
THAT WAS A BIG CHANGE FOR ME.
