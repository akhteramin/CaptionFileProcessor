THAT'S WHERE IT MAKES BRIDGES

475
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:30,681

FOR TRAVELING ON, AND THAT'S    

476
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:31,682
FOR TRAVELING ON, AND THAT'S    
WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT FOR

THIS IS ICE POTENTIAL, THIS IS  
SHOWING WE COULD BE DEALING     

481
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:42,059
SHOWING WE COULD BE DEALING     
WITH A QUARTER INCH OF ICE.     

482
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,261
WITH A QUARTER INCH OF ICE.     
WE COULD BE LOOKING AT POWER    

483
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:44,362
WE COULD BE LOOKING AT POWER    
OUTAGES OUT IN THAT DIRECTION,  

484
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:45,463
OUTAGES OUT IN THAT DIRECTION,  
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH    

485
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:46,531
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH    
FOR POWER OUTAGES INSIDE THE    

486
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:55,139
FOR POWER OUTAGES INSIDE THE    
METRO AREA BUT A GLAZING OF     

487
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:56,474
METRO AREA BUT A GLAZING OF     
ICE, IT'LL MAKE ENOUGH TO CAUSE 

488
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:57,275
ICE, IT'LL MAKE ENOUGH TO CAUSE 
REALLY DIFFICULT TRAVEL AND

00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:57,775
REALLY DIFFICULT TRAVEL AND

       <i> grow up stronger.</i>       

573
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:59,090
    Patients that I see that    
    complain about dry mouth,   

574
00:20:59,192 --> 00:21:01,258
    they feel like they have    
    to drink a lot of water.    

575
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,662
   Medications seem to be the   
 number one cause for dry mouth.

576
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:07,798
       Dry mouth can cause      
       increased cavities,      

577
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:09,934
  bad breath, oral irritation.  

578
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:12,002
  I like to recommend Biotene.  

579
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:16,107
    Biotene has a full array    
  of products that replenishes  

580
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:18,309
   the moisture in your mouth.  

581
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:19,910
    Biotene definitely works.   

582
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:22,613
        It makes patients       
        so much happier.        

583
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:58,449
     I'm a concrete mason.      

584
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:01,101
 I had severe fatigue, went to  
           a doctor.            

585
00:22:01,137 --> 00:22:03,721
     Became diagnosed with      
      Hodgkin's lymphoma.       

586
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:06,056
    I had to put my trust in    
           somebody.            

587
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:09,593
  We recommended chemotherapy,  
and then a stem cell transplant.

588
00:22:09,612 --> 00:22:10,561
 When his disease progressed,   

589
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:13,397
  I thought that he would be a  
         good candidate         

590
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:14,448
       for immunotherapy        

591
00:22:14,484 --> 00:22:18,202
  to unleash his immune system  
      against the cancer.       

592
00:22:18,237 --> 00:22:19,787
   I'm back to working hard.    

593
