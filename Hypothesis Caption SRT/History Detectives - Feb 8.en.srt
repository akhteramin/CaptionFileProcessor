342
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:56,527

       JACKSON DID NOT WRITE IT.

622

IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE         
JACKSON'S HANDWRITING, NO.      

623
00:27:01,352 --> 00:27:03,252
      HAS THERE BEEN AN ANALYSIS

              IN THIS LETTER?   

625
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,623
AS FAR AS I KNOW, NO ONE HAS    
EVER TAKEN IT TO THAT STEP      

626
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:09,859
BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT            
IT WAS UNNECESSARY.             

627

HEATHER, NICE TO MEET YOU.      

634
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:32,481
SO THIS IS THE ORIGINAL LETTER. 

635
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:36,285
I PICKED TWO OF OUR             
JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH LETTERS     

636
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:37,987
FOR A HANDWRITING ANALYSIS.     

637
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:39,622
I PICKED THESE TWO LETTERS      

638
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:42,491
BECAUSE THEY WERE CLOSEST       
IN DATE AND FORMAT              

639
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,394

643
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:54,470
HE SIGNS THE LETTER TO JACKSON  
WITH HIS FULL NAME,             

644
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:56,205
JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH.            

645
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:59,442
ALL OF THE LETTERS AT THE FOLGER
ARE SIGNED J.B. BOOTH,          

646
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:01,877
AND THAT WAS HIS TYPICAL        
SIGNATURE.                      

647
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:03,713
    <i> THE REST OF THE LETTER</i>     
         <i> LOOKS AS IF</i>           

648
00:28:03,781 --> 00:28:05,881

      <i> FROM THE SAME PEN.</i>

TO YOU REPEATED CAUTIONS,"      

650
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:11,387
AND SEE THE BOTTOM OF THAT C,   

651
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:13,422
HOW IT LOOPS AROUND             
DRAMATICALLY?                   

652
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:16,025
WELL, IN THIS LETTER HERE,      
WE SEE THE WORD "CAMP"          

653
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:20,296
WITH THAT SAME VERY DISTINCTIVE 
MAJUSCULE C,                    

654
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:24,333
WHICH IS VERY UNIQUE            
TO JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH.         

655
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:27,036
ONE OF THE MOST DISTINCTIVE     
ATTRIBUTES HE HAS               

656
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:30,072
IS THE CROSSBAR                 
ON THE MINISCULE T's.           

657
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:33,376
SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE WORD "THE"
IN THIS LETTER,                 

658
00:28:33,444 --> 00:28:36,946
THE CROSSBAR GOES FULLY ACROSS  
NOT JUST THE T                  

659
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:38,881
BUT ALSO THE H AND THE E.

   <i> SHE SAYS THE FORGER WAS</i>     
   <i> AT THE TOP OF HIS CLASS.</i>

        <i> HEATHER'S MADE</i>         
      <i> ANOTHER DISCOVERY.</i>       

663
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,193
THIS LETTER FROM 1834           

664
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:54,897
MENTIONS THAT HE NEEDED         
TO ESCAPE THE FARM              

665
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:57,299
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS            
AND GO TO PHILADELPHIA,         

666
00:28:57,368 --> 00:29:00,069
AND IT SAYS, "THEREFORE         
I STROLLED TO PHILADELPHIA.     

667
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:03,806
BROWER'S HOTEL IS NOW           
ABOUT THE BEST IN THAT CITY."   

668
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,841
             SO HE HAS A HISTORY
             OF FREQUENTING     

669
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,544
              THE BROWER'S HOTEL
              IN PHILADELPHIA.  

670
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:09,979
           SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

671
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:12,815
         DID JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH
         WRITE THIS LETTER?     

672
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:15,384
BASED ON HANDWRITING ANALYSIS   
ALONE,                          

673
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:18,587
YES, IT IS A JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH
LETTER.                         

674
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:20,222
BUT I'M NOT A BOOTH EXPERT,     

675
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:23,192
SO I THINK THAT'S A QUESTION    
FOR BOOTH SCHOLARS.             

676
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,995
WE'D NEED TO FIND OUT MORE      
ABOUT THE CONTEXT OF THE LETTER.

00:29:26,063 --> 00:29:28,531
       <i> WHY DID A FAMOUS</i>

919

   IT HITS AN EXPLOSIVE CAP,    

922

00:49:54,356 --> 00:49:57,591
HOW COULD YOU PUT THIS          
INTO A GRAVE,                   

1123
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:01,595
SET THE TRIGGERS,               
AND FILL THE GRAVE UP           

1124
00:50:01,664 --> 00:50:03,630
WITHOUT BLOWING                 
YOUR HEAD OFF?

    YOU GOT ME IN SUSPENSE HERE!

1126

THOMAS HOWELL WAS SO SUCCESSFUL 
WITH HIS FIRST GRAVE TORPEDO    

1127
00:50:10,372 --> 00:50:12,606
THAT HE DESIGNED                
ANOTHER ONE,                    

1128
00:50:12,675 --> 00:50:14,608
AND I HAVE A PATENT             
FOR THAT ONE HERE.              

1129
00:50:14,677 --> 00:50:16,376
                     NO, REALLY?

1130
00:50:16,445 --> 00:50:20,414
             "GRAVE TORPEDO,

1135
00:50:32,194 --> 00:50:35,262
          IS A THIN METAL SHIELD
          THAT FIT OVER THIS    

1136
00:50:35,331 --> 00:50:37,331

                IN THE MIDDLE...

1137
00:50:37,399 --> 00:50:38,799
RIGHT.                          

1138
00:50:38,867 --> 00:50:41,201
 THAT ACCORDING TO THE PATENT   
 PAPERS, YOU'D TAKE A LONG TUBE,

1139
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:43,971
     LIKE A STANDPIPE, YOU'D    
     PUT A FUNNEL UP AT THE TOP,

1140

CORRECT.                        

1142
00:50:47,309 --> 00:50:49,810
  AND YOU'D FILL THIS CHAMBER UP
  WITH GUNPOWDER.               

1143
00:50:49,878 --> 00:50:52,079
         THEN ONCE THE CHAMBER'S
         FILLED UP,             

1144
00:50:52,147 --> 00:50:55,215
 YOU'D DROP A CORK DOWN         
 THE STANDPIPE, OR SOME STOPPER.

ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S ASSASSINATION,

1190
