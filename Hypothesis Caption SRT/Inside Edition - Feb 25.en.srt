490
00:15:59,242 --> 00:16:02,610

492
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:08,916
  helping me find a way to go   
    through the treatments.     

493
00:16:08,918 --> 00:16:11,919
    The reality of cancer is    
    not everybody survives.     

494
00:16:11,921 --> 00:16:13,704
            At CTCA,

        That was amazing        
     because the whole day      

497
00:16:17,961 --> 00:16:19,794
