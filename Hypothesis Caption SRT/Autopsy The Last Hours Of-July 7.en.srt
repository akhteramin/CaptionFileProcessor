     and we all went, "Ahh,"

    unique artistic talent.     

118
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:29,755
    (BEV) Music saved Kurt.     

119
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:33,158
  I think it was the only way   
    he knew to express his      
           feelings.            

120
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:35,594
   I really do think it was     
     therapeutic for him.       

121
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:39,297
         'Kurt started          
     by playing the drums       

122
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,299
  before moving on to guitar.   

123
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:45,504
 But it wasn't until he was 18  
  that he met Chris Novoselic   

124
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,506
 and formed the band Nirvana.   

125
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:51,176
  It was Kurt's approach that   
   would be at the forefront    

126
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:53,178
   of a new style of music.     

127

130
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:05,424
  stick it all in a soup and    
  come out with what he did,    

131
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:07,759
       I think that was         
     pretty revolutionary.

 'This fusion of rock and punk  
    became known as grunge.

 the charts around the world,

   as the biggest rock star     
      of his generation.        

145

  As soon as she married him,   

148
00:08:02,216 --> 00:08:05,083
  I listened to a lot of his    
 poetry and a lot of his music  

149
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:07,252
  and I thought, "This guy's    
       pretty profound."        

150
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:11,122
 (BEV) I think he was popular   
    because he was wounded.     

151
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:14,593
    He looked like a person     
   who was down on his luck     

152
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:16,595
        and rebellious.         

153
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:19,865
   So I think the kids could    
    really relate to that.

    to Kurt Cobain's death.     

158
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:36,014
       And I'm surprised        
     at how small Kurt is.      

159
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:40,619
     Bass guitarist Chris       
 Novoselic is incredibly tall.

   He's six foot six inches.    

161
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:45,924
    And drummer David Grohl     
       is six feet tall.        

162
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:49,861
   According to his records,    
      Kurt was five-nine,       

163
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:52,564
    but looked considerably     
           smaller.             

164
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:59,538
    This could be due to a      
   disorder he was suffering    
    from, called scoliosis.     

165
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:02,173
     And in this recently       
     discovered interview,      

166
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:06,044
     Kurt sheds new light       
      on what he thought        
    caused this condition.      

167
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:10,849
        I had scoliosis         
  when I was in junior high.    

168
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,018
   I've been playing guitar     
          ever since.           

169
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,053
   The weight of the guitar     
       has made my back         

170
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:17,756
    grow in this curvature.     

171
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,158
       So when I stand,         
    everything's sideways.      

172
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:27,299
    (DR. HUNTER) Scoliosis,     
  or curvature of the spine,    

173
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:29,568
        occurs in about         
   three per cent of people.    

174
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:32,671
    It most commonly arises     
     in the teenage years.      

175
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:36,775
  The curve is usually either   
   S-shaped, with two bends,    

176
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,777
     or C-shaped with one.      

177
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:43,048
      His music felt like       
    he was always in pain,      

178
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,016
   that he was angst-ridden.    

179
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:49,187
  That's a typical reflection   
       of the scoliosis         

180
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:51,189
     that he battled with.      

181
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:55,694
  It's a common misconception   
  that scoliosis causes pain.   

182
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:57,963
          But that is           
     not always the case.       

183
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:01,967
       And the cause is         
      oftentimes unknown.       

184
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:06,504
       This is an X-ray         
    of Kurt Cobain's spine.     

185
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,207
     It shows that he had       
      C-shaped scoliosis.       

186
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:13,812
  This wouldn't be caused by    
   the weight of his guitar     

187
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:16,281
        but it could be         
      exacerbated by it.        

188
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,385
    As there is no mention      
          of any pain           

189
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,387
   or psychological distress    

190
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:24,372
        associated with         
        this condition,         

191
00:10:24,408 --> 00:10:27,709
 I don't believe that this was  
  responsible for his death.    

192
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:34,482
   However, Kurt did suffer     
  from another long-standing    
       medical condition        

193
00:10:34,518 --> 00:10:36,985
           that had             
     a huge impact on him.      

194
00:10:37,988 --> 00:10:40,588
   So I want to investigate     
      whether it led him        

195
00:10:40,624 --> 00:10:42,590
     to take his own life.      

196
00:10:45,594 --> 00:10:47,362
       I remember putting       
        on a brave face         

197
00:10:47,364 --> 00:10:49,230
       to hide my symptoms      
         of depression.         

198
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,616
   I was on an antidepressant.  

199
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:53,768
   But I still had depression   
          symptoms...           

200
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,588
      It was tough getting      
       through the day...       

201
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,073
    hiding how I really felt.   

202
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,742
    Something had to change.    

203
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:04,229
        So I talked to my       
        doctor for real.        

204
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:06,748
         No more saying,        
         “Oh, I'm fine.”        

205
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,535
   This time, I spoke up about  
     living behind the mask.    

206
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:12,604
  And he told me about REXULTI. 

207
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:15,473
   He said that REXULTI, when   
 added to an antidepressant, ...

208
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:18,543
 has been proven to help reduce 
    symptoms of depression.     

209
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:19,928
 Without giving up the progress 

210
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,713
       I may have made on       
       my antidepressant.       

211
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:24,315
   <i> REXULTI is not for everyone.</i>

00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:54,792
   basically, life was over.    

359
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:58,029
 I can see from Kurt's records  

360
00:19:58,064 --> 00:20:00,765
      that he was treated       
  for his stomach condition.    

361
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:03,868
     And he also had three      
     endoscopic procedures      

362
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:07,738
 to try to determine precisely  
    the cause of his pain.      

363
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:11,576
     An endoscopy is where      
  a small camera is inserted    

364
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:14,946
  through the mouth and then    
     moved down the throat      

365
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:17,048
  into the esophagus, stomach   

366
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,550
  and upper gastro-intestinal   
            tract.              

367
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:23,287
 The camera relays the images   
      back to the screen,       

368
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:26,490
       where the doctor         
    can see inside the body     

369
00:20:26,526 --> 00:20:28,492
       in great detail.         

370
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:33,264
   'But despite having three    
   endoscopic examinations,     

371
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,433
    the doctors could find      
        no explanation          

372
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:37,435
      for Kurt's chronic        
         stomach pain,          

373
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:40,638
   leading him to speculate     
        on its causes.'         

374
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:43,374
       (KURT) Every time        
    I've had an endoscope,      

375
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,876
  they find a red irritation    
        in my stomach.          

376
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,845
      But it's just um...       

377
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,847
      It's psychosomatic.       

378
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:53,384
           It's all             
   from anger and screaming.    

379
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:56,020
  I mean, my mom had it when    
   she was in her early 20s     

380
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:58,723
  for a few years and it just   
     eventually went away.      

381
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:01,592
    She was in the hospital     
  all the time because of it.   

382
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:07,265
    Stomach pain obviously      
   ran in the Cobain family.    

383
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:11,435
   But in Kurt's case, it's     
   because of his scoliosis.    

384
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:15,973
   This condition can pinch     
       abdominal nerves,        

385
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:18,109
 causing severe stomach pain.   

386
00:21:20,013 --> 00:21:22,413
           In 1993,             
    when it was discovered      

387
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:25,483
   that this was the reason     
    for his abdominal pain,     

388
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:27,652
     a simple prescription      
        appears to have         

389
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:29,887
     brought the condition      
        under control.          

390
00:21:29,922 --> 00:21:34,091
  So I don't believe this is    
  responsible for his death.    

391
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,562
      Kurt was a frequent       
          heroin user           

392
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:42,533
  and claimed that he took it   
 to treat his abdominal pain.   

393
00:21:43,503 --> 00:21:47,772
   So I want to investigate     
  what role this drug played    
         in his death.

 When Kurt returned from Rome,  
   his heroin use increased.    

458
00:26:21,147 --> 00:26:25,449

       too much heroin.         

477
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:23,340
     'But the intervention      
          backfires,            

478
00:27:23,376 --> 00:27:26,276
    with Kurt accusing his      
 friends of being hypocrites,   

479
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:27,711
     for also using drugs       

480
00:27:27,747 --> 00:27:30,014
       while telling him        
     to stop taking them.'      

481
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:32,016
      No, we take drugs,        
       we play guitar...        

482
00:27:32,051 --> 00:27:35,786
   We're not talking about a    
  bit of party coke but about   
        life and death.         

483
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,154
 Talking about our baby, yes.   

484
00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:38,455
      Tell me I'm wrong.        

485
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:42,459
     It's pretty hard for       
 somebody to tell a drug user   

486
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:44,261
      that they shouldn't       
         be using it.           

487
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:46,263
    That's where they find      
         their peace.           

488
00:27:47,133 --> 00:27:49,133
   I'm sure he did not want     
         to stop using          

489
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:52,236
 and that's one of the reasons  
    he got angry about it.      

490
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:54,004
           You know,            
  "Don't tell me what to do!"   

491
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,406
   This isn't funny anymore.    

492
00:27:57,309 --> 00:27:59,777
   'By now, Kurt's excessive    
   drug-taking has not only     

493
00:27:59,812 --> 00:28:01,745
 alienated all of his friends   

494
00:28:01,781 --> 00:28:04,982
 but his marriage to Courtney   
    is also on the rocks.'      

495
00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:07,751
    Hypocrites, hypocrites,     
          hypocrites!           

496
00:28:07,787 --> 00:28:09,820
   Every single one of you,     
            dammit!             

497
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:14,692
   I believe Kurt's adverse     
 reaction to the intervention   

498
00:28:14,727 --> 00:28:18,028
   is because he didn't see     
   himself as a drug addict.    

499
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:23,033
    He claims he was using      
   heroin not for enjoyment     

500
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:24,635
  but for medicinal reasons.    

501
00:28:26,572 --> 00:28:28,939
     I've had this stomach      
     condition for years.       

502
00:28:28,974 --> 00:28:31,442
       There were times,        
   especially during touring    

503
00:28:31,477 --> 00:28:33,110
     and while off a tour,      

504
00:28:33,145 --> 00:28:35,079
       where I just felt        
      like a drug addict        

505
00:28:35,114 --> 00:28:36,847
    because I was starving      

506
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:38,782
    and I went to all these     
       different doctors        

507
00:28:38,818 --> 00:28:41,051
  and they couldn't find out    
    what was wrong with me.     

508
00:28:41,087 --> 00:28:43,220
      I tried everything.       
        Nothing worked.         

509
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:46,590
    And I just decided that     
    if I'm gonna feel like      
    a junkie every morning,     

510
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:48,659
      vomiting every day,       

511
00:28:48,694 --> 00:28:50,627
 then I may as well, you know,  

512
00:28:50,663 --> 00:28:52,896
       take a substance         
     that kills that pain.      

513
00:28:53,933 --> 00:28:56,500
 (CHRISTOPHER) Kurt initially   
        got into heroin         

514
00:28:56,535 --> 00:28:59,036
   because it seemed to him     
      to be a painkiller.       

515
00:29:00,506 --> 00:29:02,406
   His whole teenage years,     

516
00:29:02,441 --> 00:29:06,944
  he was looking for various    
    pills and prescriptions     

517
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:10,748
   to help get over his bad     
    back, his bad stomach.      

518
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:15,285
  I think the idea of taking    
     a drug to escape pain      

519
00:29:15,321 --> 00:29:17,588
       is something that        
     one hears very often.      

520
00:29:17,623 --> 00:29:19,389
      And while that is,        

521
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:21,391
    I guess, understandable     
      in the short term,        

522
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:24,695
  it doesn't negate the fact    
   that it's still a choice.    

523
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:29,099
   The excuse of, "I had no     
 choice because I was in pain"  

524
00:29:29,135 --> 00:29:32,436
 is one that again you hear -   
    a lot of that excusing.     

525
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:38,776
  Kurt's explanation that he    
  used heroin for pain relief   

526
00:29:38,811 --> 00:29:40,344
         may be true.           

527
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:42,780
      But the damage that       
       that drug caused         

528
00:29:42,815 --> 00:29:45,883
        far outweighed          
    any conceived benefit.      

529
00:29:46,719 --> 00:29:49,553
   But I've found something     
   else in Kurt's background    

530
00:29:49,588 --> 00:29:53,157
    that might also explain     
   his reliance on chemical     
          stimulants.           

531
00:29:55,728 --> 00:29:58,762
     'In 1974, aged seven,      

532
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:01,265
     Kurt's manic behavior      
      worried his parents       

533
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,401
    to such an extent that      
 he is taken to the doctor's,   

534
00:30:04,436 --> 00:30:08,438
   where he's diagnosed with    
       attention deficit        
   hyperactivity disorder -     

535
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:10,140
           or ADHD -            

536
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:13,510
        and prescribed          
      the drug Ritalin.'        

537
00:30:15,181 --> 00:30:17,181
         Here you had           
       an artistic kid,         

538
00:30:17,216 --> 00:30:21,018
 who's a little bit different   
  to begin with, and wants to   
 rather draw than do his math   

539
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:23,520
    and that sort of thing.     

540
00:30:23,556 --> 00:30:26,957
  He may be acting out a bit    
   because of his home life,    

541
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:29,793
      so they did put him       
          on Ritalin.           

542
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:35,232
  Ritalin is the common name    
 for the drug Methylphenidate   

543
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:38,435
    and it's classified by      
     the Drug Enforcement       
        Administration          

544
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,537
    as a Schedule II drug,      

545
00:30:40,573 --> 00:30:44,007
  in the same classification    
       as, say, cocaine,        

546
00:30:44,043 --> 00:30:46,443
  morphine and amphetamines.    

547
00:30:46,478 --> 00:30:49,246
         Ritalin works          
  by increasing the activity    

548
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:52,282
       of the chemicals         
  dopamine and/or adrenaline    

549
00:30:52,318 --> 00:30:54,418
     in areas of the brain      
       that play a part         

550
00:30:54,453 --> 00:30:57,321
   in controlling attention     
         and behavior.          

551
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:01,425
  (CHRISTOPHER) He was first    
      prescribed Ritalin        

552
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,827
     and you can see that       
    that might have started     

553
00:31:03,863 --> 00:31:07,231
       a life-time habit        
  of relying on various drugs   

554
00:31:07,266 --> 00:31:09,399
   to balance his mood out.     

555
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:13,270
    Along with the Ritalin      
   there came sleeping pills    

556
00:31:13,305 --> 00:31:17,040
 because he couldn't sometimes  
     go to bed at night -       
     even as a youngster.       

557
00:31:17,076 --> 00:31:21,245
   So already you can begin     
     to see where there's       
       a certain amount         

558
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:25,315
    of chemical assistance      
   going on, just to get him    
       through the day.         

559
00:31:25,351 --> 00:31:27,451
 'After his parents' divorce,   

560
00:31:27,486 --> 00:31:29,386
       Kurt stayed with         
         each of them,          

561
00:31:29,421 --> 00:31:31,355
         but following          
     continual arguments,       

562
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,490
   both asked him to leave.     

563
00:31:33,525 --> 00:31:36,894
       At 15 years old,         
   Kurt Cobain was homeless     

564
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:40,564
         and his ADHD           
     was going untreated.       

565
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:44,401
   Over the next four years,    
 Kurt had ten different homes.  

566
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:47,437
   He would stay at friends'    
 houses and sleep in hallways,  

567
00:31:47,473 --> 00:31:49,873
     abandoned properties       
      or under a bridge.        

568
00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:53,610
     As Kurt increasingly       
    dropped out of society,     

569
00:31:53,646 --> 00:31:55,178
  he had run-ins with the law   

570
00:31:55,214 --> 00:31:58,015
       and was arrested         
        for vandalism.          

571
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:01,551
         For a decade,          
    his ADHD went untreated     

572
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:05,022
  and his addiction to heroin   
  reached dangerous levels.'    

573
00:32:07,793 --> 00:32:11,028
    There is no evidence to     
  suggest that Ritalin itself   

574
00:32:11,063 --> 00:32:12,763
      leads to addiction.       

575
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:15,432
    But children with ADHD      

576
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:18,135
    are two to three times      
          more likely           

577
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:21,405
    to have substance abuse     
     issues later in life.

    and to alter his moods,

     thinks he fled rehab       
 for very different reasons.'   

593
00:33:19,298 --> 00:33:22,566
  There was a chance that he    
 could have been really helped  

594
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:24,067
       in that facility,        

595
00:33:24,103 --> 00:33:27,504
   but he apparently did not    
  want to stop using heroin.    

596
00:33:30,776 --> 00:33:33,944
  It may very well have been    
       that the prospect        
     of coming off heroin       

597
00:33:33,979 --> 00:33:35,645
      was scary for Kurt.       

598
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:38,281
      This was one of his       
      coping mechanisms.        

599
00:33:38,317 --> 00:33:41,651
   This was one of the tools    
      that helped get him       
       through the day.         

600
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:43,854
         In his mind,           
   this was one of the tools    

601
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:45,589
   that kept the pain away,     

602
00:33:45,624 --> 00:33:47,224
  that helped the creativity,   

603
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:49,926
     that kept him stable       
         in some ways.          

604
00:33:50,429 --> 00:33:52,829
          So, one of            
     the biggest barriers       

605
00:33:52,865 --> 00:33:55,032
    to him actually seeking     
     the help that he did       

606
00:33:55,067 --> 00:33:58,902
    may have been this fear     
      of what it was like       
  to live without the heroin.   

607
00:34:02,775 --> 00:34:05,609
   I can see from the report    
    that drug paraphernalia     

608
00:34:05,644 --> 00:34:08,078
    was found at the scene      
       of Kurt's death.         

609
00:34:08,113 --> 00:34:10,981
          He also had           
    a blood morphine level      

610
00:34:11,016 --> 00:34:14,117
      of 1.52 milligrams        
          per liter -           

611
00:34:14,153 --> 00:34:16,486
          and that is           
     a tremendous amount.       

612
00:34:18,023 --> 00:34:19,389
  So the question I have is:    

613
00:34:19,425 --> 00:34:22,692
  what happened to Kurt from    
  the time that he left rehab   

614
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:25,162
       and when he died         
       four days later?

     some forcible entry.

        it was evident

653

     we could do for him.

    perhaps with his thumb      
         or something.

    distorted or misshapen,

    and notify the family,

   was a newspaper reporter

  because he's in treatment."

   incapacitate the person.

       with Rohypnol...         

862

      what we think to be       

863
00:48:37,181 --> 00:48:39,916
  a massive dose of fentanyl.   

864
00:48:41,152 --> 00:48:43,085
           He died.             

865
00:48:43,121 --> 00:48:44,987
     They had to give him       
           a shotgun            

866
00:48:45,423 --> 00:48:49,091
   and shoot him to make it     
 look like it was an absolute   

867
00:48:49,127 --> 00:48:51,093
 prima facie case of suicide.

     synthetic painkiller,      

870
00:49:06,077 --> 00:49:07,610
     similar to morphine,       

871
00:49:07,645 --> 00:49:10,079
      but a hundred times       
         more potent.           

872
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:12,315
 And the autopsy also revealed  

873
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:15,117
       the presence of a        
   diazepam-like substance.     

874
00:49:15,153 --> 00:49:17,486
        And this could          
     possibly be Rohypnol.

     is the heroin level.       

876
00:49:23,227 --> 00:49:26,562
   70 times the lethal dose     
    for the average person.     

877
00:49:26,597 --> 00:49:29,165
          Three times           
  for the most severe junkie.   

878

     Forensic pathological      
          experts say           

879
00:49:31,202 --> 00:49:33,469
      there's never been        
      one case documented       

880
00:49:33,504 --> 00:49:35,371
  in the history of humankind   

881
00:49:35,406 --> 00:49:37,840
      with so much heroin       
     in somebody's system.      

882
00:49:39,377 --> 00:49:41,510
       Kurt did have an         
   exceptionally high level     

883
00:49:41,546 --> 00:49:43,779
    of heroin in his system     
         when he died.          

884
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:46,916
    But, I believe there's      
    an explanation for this     

885
00:49:46,951 --> 00:49:49,652
     and the other factors      
        people point to         

886
00:49:49,687 --> 00:49:51,387
    as proof of foul play.      

887
00:49:53,257 --> 00:49:57,126
     After shotgun deaths       
 there is a lot of blood loss.  

888
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:59,962
   And the medical examiner     
 may only be able to get blood  

889
00:49:59,998 --> 00:50:02,164
    from the heart sample.      

890
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:05,234
   As Kurt shot himself soon    
  after injecting the heroin,   

891
00:50:05,269 --> 00:50:06,869
    it hadn't had a chance      

892
00:50:06,904 --> 00:50:08,938
         to distribute          
     throughout his body.       

893
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,708
  The veins drained directly    
        into the heart,         

894
00:50:12,744 --> 00:50:15,211
          so the drug           
    is concentrated there.      

895
00:50:15,246 --> 00:50:18,214
 Giving a much higher reading   
         than normal.           

896
00:50:20,418 --> 00:50:23,452
   The lack of fingerprints     
    can also be explained.      

897
00:50:23,488 --> 00:50:26,722
  The police report says that   
 they took four latent prints   

898
00:50:26,758 --> 00:50:29,992
 but they were of poor quality  
  and couldn't be identified.   

899
00:50:30,461 --> 00:50:33,763
   Now keep in mind, the gun    
    had lain for three days     

900
00:50:33,798 --> 00:50:35,331
    in a damp environment.      

901
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:37,700
     And this is not good       
       for fingerprints.        

902
00:50:37,735 --> 00:50:39,969
         And I believe          
 this explains why the police   

903
00:50:40,004 --> 00:50:43,706
  were unable to find usable    
    prints on that weapon.      

904
00:50:44,976 --> 00:50:47,109
   Finally, the differences     
      in the handwriting        

905
00:50:47,145 --> 00:50:49,945
      on the suicide note       
         are notable.           

906
00:50:49,981 --> 00:50:51,981
          But I think           
     you can look at this       

907
00:50:52,016 --> 00:50:54,650
  and see that in the latter    
       part of the note         

908
00:50:54,685 --> 00:50:57,586
     Kurt wrote this while      
 under the influence of drugs.  

909
00:50:58,456 --> 00:51:00,923
      And a police expert       
        looked at this          

910
00:51:00,958 --> 00:51:02,825
         and confirmed          
       that this indeed         

911
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:05,061
      was the handwriting       
        of Kurt Cobain.         

912
00:51:06,264 --> 00:51:07,763
       For these reasons        

913
00:51:07,799 --> 00:51:12,435
  I believe that Kurt Cobain    
   did indeed kill himself.     

914
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:14,737
  And I think I've discovered   
        the reason why.

     have been impossible       

962
00:54:20,324 --> 00:54:23,525
 for him to have time to load   
   a gun and shoot himself.'

964
00:54:25,129 --> 00:54:26,895
       I have shown how         
      the length of time        

965
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:28,897
       that Kurt Cobain         
      went undiscovered,        

966
00:54:28,933 --> 00:54:31,834
    and the location where      
  the blood sample was taken,   

967
00:54:31,869 --> 00:54:34,903
   could have had an effect     
  on the toxicology analysis.   

968
00:54:34,939 --> 00:54:37,873
 So I am ruling out foul play   

969
00:54:37,908 --> 00:54:40,643
       as being involved        
  in some way with his death.   

970
00:54:41,479 --> 00:54:45,314
  I believe that Kurt Cobain    
   did indeed kill himself.     

971
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:49,084
   And the evidence for this    
 rests in his family history.   

972
00:54:51,989 --> 00:54:54,723
       We know that Kurt        
   was diagnosed at age nine    

973
00:54:54,759 --> 00:54:58,894
 with ADHD - attention deficit  
    hyperactivity disorder.     

974
00:54:59,864 --> 00:55:05,200
   What wasn't known is that    
 he was also likely suffering   
    from bipolar disorder.      

975
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:08,103
   And that used to be known    
     as manic depression.       

976
00:55:09,407 --> 00:55:13,375
     Kurt's mother told me      
       he suffered from         
       bipolar disorder         

977
00:55:13,411 --> 00:55:16,645
       and it made sense        
         when you saw           

978
00:55:16,681 --> 00:55:20,416
   how he was doing kind of     
      wild, crazy things.       

979
00:55:20,451 --> 00:55:23,686
         Because that           
  typifies bipolar disorder.    

980
00:55:25,923 --> 00:55:30,426
  It's a mood disorder that's   
    punctuated by this very     
  polarized way of behaving.    

981
00:55:31,028 --> 00:55:33,696
     This kind of addicted      
  workaholic that, you know,    

982
00:55:33,731 --> 00:55:36,498
     wouldn't stop, wanted      
 to get things to perfection.

00:55:36,534 --> 00:55:38,100
        Wanted to find          
      the best drummers,        

984
00:55:38,135 --> 00:55:41,570
      wanted to find the        
  best riffs, wanted to make    
    the most amazing music.     

985
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:45,941
   And then this other side,    
    which was a depressive,     

986
00:55:45,976 --> 00:55:48,544
        that just felt          
   never quite good enough.     

987
00:55:51,816 --> 00:55:54,116
     It's a very difficult      
    condition to live with.     

988
00:55:54,151 --> 00:55:56,418
    And one that needs both     
       proper medication        

989
00:55:56,454 --> 00:55:58,554
          and proper            
    psychological support.      

990
00:56:00,391 --> 00:56:03,258
  I've not been able to find    
 any evidence that Kurt Cobain  

991
00:56:03,294 --> 00:56:06,395
       was ever treated         
     for bipolar disorder.      

992
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:10,566
    But...I have discovered     
  that depression and suicide   

993
00:56:10,601 --> 00:56:12,301
   ran in the Cobain family.    

994
00:56:14,105 --> 00:56:17,439
    I have lost two uncles      
        and then Kurt.          

995
00:56:17,942 --> 00:56:20,976
    They were the same age      
 when they killed themselves,   

996
00:56:21,011 --> 00:56:24,380
      because I remember        
     Uncle Leland saying,       

997
00:56:24,415 --> 00:56:27,249
 "Oh, my gosh, in a few years   
      I'll be that age."        

998
00:56:27,284 --> 00:56:30,185
    And he was worried that     
  he would kill himself then.   

999
00:56:31,589 --> 00:56:34,289
   I've also discovered that    
   the chronic stomach pain     

1000
00:56:34,325 --> 00:56:36,558
       that Kurt thought        
     he had been cured of       

1001
00:56:36,594 --> 00:56:39,561
   had returned in the weeks    
      prior to his death.       

1002
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:45,067
      I think the reason        
   that Kurt killed himself     

1003
00:56:45,102 --> 00:56:48,604
            can be              
 summed up in one word: pain.   

1004
00:56:50,541 --> 00:56:52,207
     He was in such pain -      

1005
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:56,512
        both emotional,         
 psychological, and physical -  

1006
00:56:56,547 --> 00:56:58,981
    that he just could not      
      stand it any more.        

1007
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:02,384
      He'd rather be dead       
          than alive.           

1008
00:57:03,888 --> 00:57:06,355
  It's one of those terrible    
     ironies of his life.       

1009
00:57:06,957 --> 00:57:10,459
    That he worked so hard      
     to become something.       

1010
00:57:10,494 --> 00:57:13,495
     And then once he did       
 he didn't like it very much.   

1011
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:20,302
      I sincerely believe       
 that Kurt committed suicide.   

1012
00:57:20,971 --> 00:57:24,873
   He clearly was not happy,    
     running away, hiding.      

1013
00:57:24,909 --> 00:57:28,177
       Upping his usage,        
     not trusting anyone.       

1014
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,581
     Kurt did appear happy      
 in the months before he died.  

1015
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:36,185
 'Ever since I've been married  
     and I've had a child,      

1016
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:38,253
        I've never been         
       more optimistic.'        

1017
00:57:39,557 --> 00:57:41,957
          But I think           
      this was a facade.        

1018
00:57:45,095 --> 00:57:47,729
    When you see that kind      
   of happiness in somebody     

1019
00:57:47,765 --> 00:57:51,300
       that you know has        
  been suicidal - watch out!    

1020
00:57:52,436 --> 00:57:55,637
  Because that usually means    
  they have made the decision   

1021
00:57:55,673 --> 00:57:59,374
  to kill themselves, and now   
    they're feeling relief.     

1022
00:58:01,445 --> 00:58:04,279
   Having considered all of     
     the medical evidence,      

1023
00:58:04,315 --> 00:58:07,282
       I believe suicide        
    is the best explanation     

1024
00:58:07,318 --> 00:58:09,251
   for Kurt Cobain's death.     

1025
00:58:09,286 --> 00:58:11,987
      And this, I think,        
      is how it happened.       

1026
00:58:18,062 --> 00:58:19,928
           'The day             
    of Kurt Cobain's death.     

1027
00:58:22,566 --> 00:58:24,600
         Kurt removes           
     the 20-gauge shotgun       

1028
00:58:24,635 --> 00:58:26,468
     from its hiding place      
         in his closet          

1029
00:58:27,271 --> 00:58:29,671
     and heads to the room      
       above his garage.        

1030
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:38,847
    Once there he finishes      
       his suicide note.        

1031
00:58:39,783 --> 00:58:42,084
        Which he leaves         
      in a planting tray        

1032
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:44,987
        and spears with         
     the red ballpoint pen      

1033
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:47,022
       it's written in.         

1034
00:58:47,057 --> 00:58:49,291
       He unzips the bag        
     holding his shotgun.       

1035
00:58:50,594 --> 00:58:54,196
 He takes three cartridges out  
  of a box and loads the gun.   

1036
00:58:57,635 --> 00:59:00,369
   He smokes five cigarettes    
    as he sits on the floor     

1037
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:03,205
       before preparing         
   his final hit of heroin.     

1038
00:59:05,609 --> 00:59:07,509
          It contains           
      so much of the drug       

1039
00:59:07,545 --> 00:59:11,146
 that, once injected, it would  
   kill him within a minute.    

1040
00:59:15,653 --> 00:59:17,319
  After injecting the heroin,   

1041
00:59:17,354 --> 00:59:20,188
  Kurt places the gun barrel    
         in his mouth           

1042
00:59:20,224 --> 00:59:22,558
   - and pulls the trigger.     
          - (Gunshot)           

1043
00:59:22,593 --> 00:59:24,293
      He dies instantly.'       

1044
00:59:28,766 --> 00:59:31,500
        I believe that          
  Kurt Cobain killed himself    

1045
00:59:31,535 --> 00:59:33,835

     the untreated effects      

1046

       bipolar disorder.        

1047
00:59:37,508 --> 00:59:40,409
  His depressed mental state    
    was further exacerbated     

1048
00:59:40,444 --> 00:59:42,711
     by the physical pain       
   of his stomach condition     

1049
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:46,214
 and the decline in his mental  
      and physical state        

1050
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:48,617
    from his excessive use      
          of heroin.            

1051
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:56,291

00:59:57,494 --> 01:00:01,463
       But his image...         
 untarnished by age and time.'  

1053
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:04,733
      He'd be turning 50        

1054
01:00:04,768 --> 01:00:06,668
     and you can speculate      
        on what it was          

1055
01:00:06,704 --> 01:00:08,937
         he'd be doing          
        had he lived...         

1056
01:00:08,973 --> 01:00:13,442
 But doing the nostalgia tour   
         with Nirvana,          

1057
01:00:13,477 --> 01:00:15,777
  slightly fatter and balder,   

1058
01:00:15,813 --> 01:00:17,980
  playing all their old hits,   

1059
01:00:18,015 --> 01:00:20,015
  I don't think he would have   
        gone for that.
