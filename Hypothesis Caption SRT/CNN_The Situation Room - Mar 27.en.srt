00:52:46,011 --> 00:52:50,881
THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED IF HE   
THOUGHT HE WAS AN HONORABLE MAN

HE HANDLED THIS INVESTIGATION.  

1286
00:52:56,322 --> 00:53:00,190
HE HANDLED THIS INVESTIGATION.  
AND ALSO I THOUGHT IT WAS       

1287
00:53:00,192 --> 00:53:01,091

STRIKING THAT HE SAID THAT      

1288
00:53:01,093 --> 00:53:02,125
STRIKING THAT HE SAID THAT

WHY IN HIS WORDS HE PUNTED.

IN THE PRESIDENT'S CRAW AND RUDY
GIULIANI IS IS THE LINE THAT    

1321
00:54:05,324 --> 00:54:07,424

SAYS THAT WE CAN'T CONCLUDE THE

COUNSEL SHOULD NOT SAY BECAUSE

INTENDED AT ALL UNTIL WE SEE    
THAT UNDERLYING REPORT.

THAT UNDERLYING REPORT.         
ROBERT MUELLER SAID, THIS DOES

ROBERT MUELLER SAID, THIS DOES  
NOT EXONERATE HIM.              

1344
00:54:45,298 --> 00:54:47,998
NOT EXONERATE HIM.              
THAT SOUNDS LIKE HE'S PRESENT   

1345
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,733
THAT SOUNDS LIKE HE'S PRESENT   
ING THE LEGAL ARGUMENTS ON BOTH 

1346
00:54:49,735 --> 00:54:49,934
ING THE LEGAL ARGUMENTS ON BOTH 
SIDES.

SIDES.                          
AND HE'S GOING TO LEAVE THAT FOR

1348

AND HE'S GOING TO LEAVE THAT FOR
CONGRESS TO DECIDE.             

1349
00:54:51,804 --> 00:54:54,205
CONGRESS TO DECIDE.             
I THINK WHEN WE'RE SEEING IS THE

1350
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:56,507
I THINK WHEN WE'RE SEEING IS THE
WHITE HOUSE STRATEGY THAT       

1351
00:54:56,509 --> 00:55:00,311
WHITE HOUSE STRATEGY THAT       
BETWEEN THE BARR SUMMARY AND

MUELLER REPORT TO CAPITALIZE ON 
THE CHAOS AND CONFUSION IS AND  

1354
00:55:01,981 --> 00:55:04,115
THE CHAOS AND CONFUSION IS AND  
THROW AS MUCH SAND AS POSSIBLE

00:55:04,117 --> 00:55:07,618
THROW AS MUCH SAND AS POSSIBLE  
IN HOPING A TO GET A NARRATIVE  

1356
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:07,985
IN HOPING A TO GET A NARRATIVE  
THAT WILL STICK.                

1357
00:55:07,987 --> 00:55:11,322
THAT WILL STICK.                
>> IT'S POSSIBLE ALSO THAT THERE

00:55:11,324 --> 00:55:12,056
>> IT'S POSSIBLE ALSO THAT THERE
WAS SOME DISAGREEMENT AMONG THE

LAWYERS WORKING FOR MUELLER.    

1360
