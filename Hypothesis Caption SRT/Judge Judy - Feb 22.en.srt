To be honest with you, man, I do

To be honest with you, man, I do
not have the slightest idea.

not have the slightest idea.    
But I'm gonna let you know right

857
00:27:25,228 --> 00:27:26,461
But I'm gonna let you know right
now that she's really like --

now that she's really like --   
she's vindictive, you know what 

859
00:27:27,764 --> 00:27:28,330
she's vindictive, you know what 
I'm saying?                     

860
00:27:28,332 --> 00:27:29,631
I'm saying?

00:27:30,901 --> 00:27:32,000
I decided I'm leaving, and I'm  
not about to just give you      

863
00:27:32,002 --> 00:27:33,301
not about to just give you      
everything that I've worked for 

864
00:27:33,303 --> 00:27:34,469
everything that I've worked for 
and walk away with nothing.     

865
00:27:34,471 --> 00:27:35,603
and walk away with nothing.     
You can do that to her, but     

866
00:27:35,605 --> 00:27:36,905
You can do that to her, but     
you're not gonna do that to me. 

867
00:27:36,907 --> 00:27:38,106
you're not gonna do that to me.

It's, you know -- I don't know  

870
00:27:40,677 --> 00:27:42,377
It's, you know -- I don't know  
what made her do it, but I guess

871
00:27:42,379 --> 00:27:43,945
what made her do it, but I guess
that would probably have saved  

872
00:27:43,947 --> 00:27:45,613
that would probably have saved  
my truck if I wouldn't have made

873
00:27:45,615 --> 00:27:46,981
my truck if I wouldn't have made
a funny joke or whatever.

laughed as I was walking off    

876
00:27:50,087 --> 00:27:51,152
laughed as I was walking off    
with all my books.              

877
00:27:51,154 --> 00:27:52,487
with all my books.

>> I didn't make no joke.       
The girl just walked off acting 

879
00:27:54,124 --> 00:27:55,490
The girl just walked off acting 
some type of way for some       

880
00:27:55,492 --> 00:27:56,024
some type of way for some

>> Stay away from her.          
She's real vindictive.          

892
00:28:07,704 --> 00:28:08,570
She's real vindictive.          
I'm for real, man.              

893
00:28:08,572 --> 00:28:09,804
I'm for real, man.              
Whoever come across her, man,

beginning, but you'll see the   

898
00:28:14,311 --> 00:28:15,677
beginning, but you'll see the   
faultiness as you deal with him,

899
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:16,778
faultiness as you deal with him,
and he left her for eight       

900
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,212
and he left her for eight       
months.                         

901
00:28:17,214 --> 00:28:18,480

The car was trashed to me

The car was trashed to me

I'd already had fun in the car.
