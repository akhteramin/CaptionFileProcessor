So, we re-imagined the razor    
with the new Gillette SkinGuard.

898
00:23:35,031 --> 00:23:37,564
     It has a unique guard      
     between the blades.        

899
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:41,035
  That's designed to reduce     
  irritation during the shave.  

900
00:23:42,205 --> 00:23:46,207
 Because we believe all men     
 deserve a razor just for them.

BUT I THINK THE CONSTRAINT THAT 

1374
00:40:23,488 --> 00:40:24,788
BUT I THINK THE CONSTRAINT THAT 
BOB MUELLER IS OPERATING UNDER, 

1375
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:25,955
BOB MUELLER IS OPERATING UNDER, 
HE HAD AN ACTING ATTORNEY       

1376
00:40:25,957 --> 00:40:26,923
HE HAD AN ACTING ATTORNEY       
GENERAL WHO WAS APPOINTED       

1377
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,057
GENERAL WHO WAS APPOINTED       
BECAUSE HE WOULD BE HOSTILE TO A

1378
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:30,393
BECAUSE HE WOULD BE HOSTILE TO A
SUBPOENA ON THE PRESIDENT.      

1379
00:40:30,395 --> 00:40:35,532
SUBPOENA ON THE PRESIDENT.      
AND NOW, HE HAS A PERMANENT     

1380
00:40:35,534 --> 00:40:38,134
AND NOW, HE HAS A PERMANENT     
ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO WAS CHOSEN 

1381
00:40:38,136 --> 00:40:38,835
ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO WAS CHOSEN 
FOR THE SAME HOSTILITY TO HIS   

1382
00:40:38,837 --> 00:40:39,569
FOR THE SAME HOSTILITY TO HIS   
INVESTIGATION, WHO WOULD LIKELY 

1383
00:40:39,571 --> 00:40:40,703
INVESTIGATION, WHO WOULD LIKELY 
OPPOSE THAT STEP.               

1384
00:40:40,705 --> 00:40:42,405
OPPOSE THAT STEP.               
I ALSO THINK THE SPECIAL COUNSEL

1385
00:40:42,407 --> 00:40:44,274
I ALSO THINK THE SPECIAL COUNSEL
FEELS SOME TIME PRESSURE TO     

1386
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:44,974
FEELS SOME TIME PRESSURE TO     
CONCLUDE HIS WORK AND KNOWING   

1387
00:40:44,976 --> 00:40:45,708
CONCLUDE HIS WORK AND KNOWING   
THE WHITE HOUSE WOULD DRAG OUT A

1388
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:46,876
THE WHITE HOUSE WOULD DRAG OUT A
FIGHT OVER THE SUBPOENA.        

1389
00:40:46,878 --> 00:40:48,978
FIGHT OVER THE SUBPOENA.        
THAT MAY BE AN ISSUE, AS WELL.  

1390
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,480
THAT MAY BE AN ISSUE, AS WELL.  
I THINK ULTIMATELY IT'S A       

1391
00:40:50,482 --> 00:40:51,614
I THINK ULTIMATELY IT'S A       
MISTAKE BECAUSE PROBABLY THE    

1392
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:52,782
MISTAKE BECAUSE PROBABLY THE    
BEST WAY TO GET THE TRUTH WOULD 

1393
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:54,083
BEST WAY TO GET THE TRUTH WOULD 
BE TO PUT THE PRESIDENT UNDER   

1394
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:55,185
BE TO PUT THE PRESIDENT UNDER   
OATH.

AS HE'S MADE PLAIN IN THE PAST, 
HE FEELS IT'S FINE TO LIE TO THE

1397
00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:01,858
HE FEELS IT'S FINE TO LIE TO THE
PUBLIC AFTER ALL HE HAS SAID,   

1398
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,592
PUBLIC AFTER ALL HE HAS SAID,   
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M TALKING BEFORE

1399
00:41:02,594 --> 00:41:03,993
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M TALKING BEFORE
A MAGISTRATE.                   

1400
00:41:03,995 --> 00:41:06,196
A MAGISTRATE.                   
MAYBE HE SHOULD TALK BEFORE     

1401
00:41:06,198 --> 00:41:08,932
MAYBE HE SHOULD TALK BEFORE     
A IMAGE STRAIGHT.               

1402
00:41:08,934 --> 00:41:09,666
A IMAGE STRAIGHT.               
>> I WANT TO MOVE TO SOMETHING  

1403
00:41:09,668 --> 00:41:10,600

THAT WAS A BIT CONFUSING.       

1404
00:41:10,602 --> 00:41:12,435
THAT WAS A BIT CONFUSING.

HOUR, IT'S "MEET THE PRESS."    

1892
00:58:37,196 --> 00:58:39,030
     I've always been amazed    
         by what's next.        

1893
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:40,716
  And still going for my best,  

1894
00:58:41,085 --> 00:58:42,251
     even though I live with    
     a higher risk of stroke    

1895
00:58:42,636 --> 00:58:45,370
    due to Afib not caused by   
     a heart valve problem.     

1896
00:58:45,723 --> 00:58:47,506
So if there's a better treatment
        than warfarin...        

1897
00:58:47,725 --> 00:58:48,873
        I want that too.

00:58:49,059 --> 00:58:50,142
            ELIQUIS.            

1899
00:58:50,344 --> 00:58:51,260
        ELIQUIS is proven       

1900
00:58:51,645 --> 00:58:53,512
      to reduce stroke risk     
      better than warfarin.     

1901
00:58:53,764 --> 00:58:55,264
   Plus has significantly less  

1902
00:58:55,566 --> 00:58:56,881
  major bleeding than warfarin. 

1903
00:58:57,184 --> 00:58:59,718
     ELIQUIS is FDA-approved    
          and has both.         

1904
00:58:59,904 --> 00:59:00,885
          What's next?          

1905
00:59:01,105 --> 00:59:02,321
     Reeling in a nice one.

   <i> Don't stop taking ELIQUIS</i>   
<i>unless your doctor tells you to,</i>

1907
00:59:05,192 --> 00:59:07,242
<i>as stopping increases your risk</i> 
      <i> of having a stroke.</i>      

1908
00:59:07,695 --> 00:59:10,362
 <i> ELIQUIS can cause serious and</i> 
 <i> in rare cases fatal bleeding.</i> 

1909

   <i> an artificial heart valve</i>

00:59:12,917 --> 00:59:14,283
     <i> or abnormal bleeding.</i>     

1911
00:59:14,668 --> 00:59:16,702
     <i> While taking ELIQUIS,</i>     
   <i> you may bruise more easily</i>  

1912
00:59:17,121 --> 00:59:19,538
  <i> and it may take longer than</i>  
<i>usual for any bleeding to stop.</i> 

1913
00:59:19,957 --> 00:59:21,924
  <i> Seek immediate medical care</i>  
  <i> for sudden sign of bleeding,</i>

 <i> if you take certain medicines.</i>

1917

        <i> Tell your doctor</i>

1919
00:59:29,717 --> 00:59:31,183
     ELIQUIS, the number one    

1920
00:59:31,518 --> 00:59:33,218
     cardiologist-prescribed    
         blood thinner.         

1921
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:34,720
   Ask your doctor if ELIQUIS   

1922
00:59:34,972 --> 00:59:36,405
     is what's next for you.    

1923
00:59:39,026 --> 00:59:42,160
  Guys do whatever it takes to  
  deal with shave irritation.   

1924
00:59:42,196 --> 00:59:45,581
So, we re-imagined the razor    
with the new Gillette SkinGuard.

1925
00:59:47,017 --> 00:59:49,567
     It has a unique guard      
     between the blades.        

1926
00:59:49,587 --> 00:59:53,038
  That's designed to reduce     
  irritation during the shave.  

1927
00:59:54,208 --> 00:59:58,210
 Because we believe all men     
 deserve a razor just for them. 

1928
01:00:00,598 --> 01:00:02,598
    The best a man can get.

01:00:03,417 --> 01:00:05,384
           Gillette.            

1930
01:00:06,419 --> 01:00:07,652
          I don't keep          
        track of regrets.       

1931
01:00:07,755 --> 01:00:08,987
         And I don't add        
          up the years.         

1932
01:00:09,089 --> 01:00:10,205
    But what I do count on...   

1933
01:00:10,291 --> 01:00:11,290
            is BOOST®
