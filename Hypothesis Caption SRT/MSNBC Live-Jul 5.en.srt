YOU CAN'T PRINT THE CENSUS IF

160
00:05:02,453 --> 00:05:04,419

BAD.                            
I THINK THAT THE BORDER PATROL  

1101
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:02,168
I THINK THAT THE BORDER PATROL  
HAS BEEN TREATED VERY, VERY     

1102
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:03,770
HAS BEEN TREATED VERY, VERY     
BADLY BY CERTAIN MEMBERS OF

FOR THE MOST PART THEY'RE VERY  

1106
00:37:07,709 --> 00:37:08,608
FOR THE MOST PART THEY'RE VERY  
RESPECTED BY CONGRESS BUT       

1107
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:12,646
RESPECTED BY CONGRESS BUT       
CERTAIN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS SAY 

1108
00:37:12,648 --> 00:37:14,080
CERTAIN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS SAY 
VERY BAD THINGS AND LIE AND     

1109
00:37:14,082 --> 00:37:14,481
VERY BAD THINGS AND LIE AND     
EXAGGERATE.                     

1110
00:37:14,483 --> 00:37:15,582
EXAGGERATE.                     
>> WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT

THAT, CONGRESSMAN?              
HE'S SAYING THAT CERTAIN MEMBERS

HE'S SAYING THAT CERTAIN MEMBERS
OF CONGRESS LIE AND EXAGGERATE  

1114
00:37:19,855 --> 00:37:21,788
OF CONGRESS LIE AND EXAGGERATE  
BUT THIS WASN'T -- THIS BORDER  

1115
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:22,756
BUT THIS WASN'T -- THIS BORDER  
PATROL STUFF WASN'T ACTUALLY    

1116
00:37:22,758 --> 00:37:24,324
PATROL STUFF WASN'T ACTUALLY    
REPORTED BY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS,

1117
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:25,659
REPORTED BY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS,
IT WAS REPORTED BY SOMEBODY IN  

1118
00:37:25,661 --> 00:37:28,995
IT WAS REPORTED BY SOMEBODY IN  
THAT GROUP WHO LEAKED IT TO     

1119
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:29,396
THAT GROUP WHO LEAKED IT TO     
PROPUBLICA.                     

1120
00:37:29,398 --> 00:37:30,196
PROPUBLICA.                     
>> THAT IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.    

1121
00:37:30,198 --> 00:37:32,165
>> THAT IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.    
AND YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT HAS 

1122
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:34,467
AND YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT HAS 
NEVER SEEN A LIE THAT HE DIDN'T 

1123
00:37:34,469 --> 00:37:34,768
NEVER SEEN A LIE THAT HE DIDN'T 
LIKE.                           

1124
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:36,736
LIKE.                           
AND RIGHT NOW HE'S JUST         

1125
00:37:36,738 --> 00:37:38,104
AND RIGHT NOW HE'S JUST         
SPINNING, HE'S PLAYING POLITICS 

1126
00:37:38,106 --> 00:37:39,739
SPINNING, HE'S PLAYING POLITICS 
LIKE HE'S BEEN PLAYING POLITICS 

1127
00:37:39,741 --> 00:37:42,175
LIKE HE'S BEEN PLAYING POLITICS 
WITH THESE MIGRANTS AND         

1128
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:46,613
WITH THESE MIGRANTS AND         
ABSOLUTELY, ALI, EVERYTHING THAT

1129

ABSOLUTELY, ALI, EVERYTHING THAT
I'VE HEARD ABOUT AND EVERYTHING 

1130
00:37:50,619 --> 00:37:52,852
I'VE HEARD ABOUT AND EVERYTHING 
THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS, YOU     

1131
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:54,154
THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS, YOU     
KNOW -- ALMOST LIKE TRYING TO   

1132
00:37:54,156 --> 00:37:55,956
KNOW -- ALMOST LIKE TRYING TO   
PIT THE BORDER PATROL AGENTS AND

1133
00:37:55,958 --> 00:37:58,591
PIT THE BORDER PATROL AGENTS AND
TRYING TO MAKE THIS A POLITICAL 

1134
00:37:58,593 --> 00:37:58,892
TRYING TO MAKE THIS A POLITICAL 
ISSUE.                          

1135
00:37:58,894 --> 00:38:01,061
ISSUE.                          
I WILL TELL YOU THAT THERE WAS  

1136
00:38:01,063 --> 00:38:01,828
I WILL TELL YOU THAT THERE WAS  
ANOTHER BORDER PATROL AGENT, YOU

1137
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:03,630
ANOTHER BORDER PATROL AGENT, YOU
MAY HAVE SAW THE INTERVIEW, AND 

1138
00:38:03,632 --> 00:38:05,899
MAY HAVE SAW THE INTERVIEW, AND 
HE EVEN BACKED UP THE DEPLORABLE

1139
00:38:05,901 --> 00:38:07,434
HE EVEN BACKED UP THE DEPLORABLE
CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE MIGRANTS

1140
00:38:07,436 --> 00:38:09,502
CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE MIGRANTS
WERE LIVING IN.                 

1141
00:38:09,504 --> 00:38:12,339
WERE LIVING IN.                 
SO I DON'T SEE THIS AS AN ISSUE 

1142
00:38:12,341 --> 00:38:14,274
SO I DON'T SEE THIS AS AN ISSUE 
OF DEMOCRAT VERSUS BORDER PATROL

1143
00:38:14,276 --> 00:38:14,607
OF DEMOCRAT VERSUS BORDER PATROL
AGENTS.                         

1144
00:38:14,609 --> 00:38:16,109
AGENTS.                         
I THINK THERE ARE SOME AGENTS   

1145
00:38:16,111 --> 00:38:17,944
I THINK THERE ARE SOME AGENTS   
THERE THAT FEEL LIKE THEY ARE   

1146
00:38:17,946 --> 00:38:19,179
THERE THAT FEEL LIKE THEY ARE   
EMPOWERED TO DO ANYTHING THEY   

1147
00:38:19,181 --> 00:38:20,347
EMPOWERED TO DO ANYTHING THEY   
WANT TO DO BECAUSE OF THE       

1148
00:38:20,349 --> 00:38:21,915
WANT TO DO BECAUSE OF THE       
DIRECTION THAT THEY GET FROM THE

1149
00:38:21,917 --> 00:38:23,183
DIRECTION THAT THEY GET FROM THE
EXECUTIVE BRANCH, FROM THE      

1150
00:38:23,185 --> 00:38:24,017
EXECUTIVE BRANCH, FROM THE      
STATEMENTS THAT COME OUT OF THE 

1151
00:38:24,019 --> 00:38:25,986
STATEMENTS THAT COME OUT OF THE 
PRESIDENT'S MOUTH, FROM THE     

1152
00:38:25,988 --> 00:38:29,222
PRESIDENT'S MOUTH, FROM THE     
ACTIONS THAT COME OUT OF THE    

1153
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:31,424
ACTIONS THAT COME OUT OF THE    
PRESIDENT'S IMMIGRATION POLICY  

1154
00:38:31,426 --> 00:38:31,758
PRESIDENT'S IMMIGRATION POLICY  
PEOPLE.

I THINK THAT SORT OF CULTURE HAS

BEEN ALLOWED TO EXIST THERE.

BORDER PATROL AGENT IS A BAD    

1160
00:38:41,937 --> 00:38:42,268
BORDER PATROL AGENT IS A BAD

THAT SOME FARMERS ARE LOSING

THAT IS THE BIG QUESTION.       

1480
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:10,289
THAT IS THE BIG QUESTION.       
YOU'RE WATCHING MSNBC.          

1481
00:50:26,374 --> 00:50:27,306
 I have one kid in each branch  
        of the military,        

1482
00:50:27,341 --> 00:50:28,541
    but I'm command central.    

1483
00:50:30,344 --> 00:50:32,178
    It's so important to us     
          that Verizon          

1484
00:50:32,213 --> 00:50:33,846
is supporting military families.

1485
00:50:33,881 --> 00:50:35,247
 When I have a child deployed,  

1486
00:50:35,283 --> 00:50:37,349
   having a reliable network    
       means everything.        

1487
00:50:37,385 --> 00:50:38,484
  So, when I get a video chat,  

1488
00:50:38,519 --> 00:50:40,286
  and I get to see their face,  

1489
00:50:40,321 --> 00:50:41,520
      it's the best thing       
         in the world.          

1490
00:50:41,556 --> 00:50:43,255
   And I've earned every one    
      of these gray hairs.      

1491
00:50:43,291 --> 00:50:45,491
  Military moms, we serve too.  

1492
00:50:45,526 --> 00:50:47,626
              (VO)              
The network more people rely on,
        gives you more.         

1493
00:50:47,662 --> 00:50:50,129
    Like military plans with    
 a special price on Unlimited,  

1494
00:50:50,164 --> 00:50:52,231
 $100 per line, and big savings 

1495
00:50:52,266 --> 00:50:53,966
       on our best phones       
        when you switch.        

1496
00:50:54,001 --> 00:50:55,101
        That's Verizon.         

1497
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:56,585
    When I book at Hilton.com   

1498
00:50:57,105 --> 00:50:58,437
     I get to select my room    
     from the floor plan...     

1499
00:50:58,639 --> 00:50:59,588
          Free Wi-Fi...

1501
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:02,441
         So with Hilton         
       there is no catch.       

1502
00:51:02,777 --> 00:51:04,977
       Yeah the only catch      
      is I'm never leaving.     

1503
00:51:05,279 --> 00:51:06,645
         No I'm serious,

BUT THERE IS A WIDENING GAP     

1508
00:51:51,826 --> 00:51:55,261
BUT THERE IS A WIDENING GAP     
BETWEEN THE RICHEST AMERICANS   

1509
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:55,761
BETWEEN THE RICHEST AMERICANS

1510
00:51:55,763 --> 00:51:57,263

MUCH OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH     

1511
00:51:57,265 --> 00:51:59,965
MUCH OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH     
WEALTH AND THE ABILITY FOR THE

IN FACT FOR A LITTLE WHILE HERE

00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:08,100
IN FACT FOR A LITTLE WHILE HERE 
IN THE 2000s, THEY WERE MAKING

00:53:08,102 --> 00:53:10,603
IN THE 2000s, THEY WERE MAKING  
NEGATIVE GAINS, THEY WERE LOSING

00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:14,373
WEALTH.                         
SO WHAT'S CAUSING THIS DRAMATIC 

1559
00:53:14,375 --> 00:53:14,740
SO WHAT'S CAUSING THIS DRAMATIC 
DISPARITY?                      

1560
00:53:14,742 --> 00:53:16,408
DISPARITY?                      
THE "ASSOCIATED PRESS" ANALYZED 

1561
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:18,177
THE "ASSOCIATED PRESS" ANALYZED 
THAT FEWER MIDDLE CLASS         

1562
00:53:18,179 --> 00:53:20,312
THAT FEWER MIDDLE CLASS         
AMERICANS ARE OWNING HOMES.     

1563
00:53:20,314 --> 00:53:22,514
AMERICANS ARE OWNING HOMES.     
THE PRICE GAINS IF YOU OWN A    

1564
00:53:22,516 --> 00:53:25,017
THE PRICE GAINS IF YOU OWN A    
HOME HAS MADE HOME OWNERSHIP    

1565
00:53:25,019 --> 00:53:26,418
HOME HAS MADE HOME OWNERSHIP    
LESS FEASIBLE FOR NEW BUYERS.   

1566
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:27,720
LESS FEASIBLE FOR NEW BUYERS.   
SO IF YOU HAD A HOME, YOU'VE    

1567
00:53:27,722 --> 00:53:28,287
SO IF YOU HAD A HOME, YOU'VE    
DONE WELL.                      

1568
00:53:28,289 --> 00:53:30,856
DONE WELL.                      
IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE A HOME, THE  

1569
00:53:30,858 --> 00:53:31,991
IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE A HOME, THE  
PRICES HAVE MADE IT HARD TO GET 

1570
00:53:31,993 --> 00:53:32,258
PRICES HAVE MADE IT HARD TO GET 
IN.                             

1571
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:33,926
IN.                             
BUT THEN THE RECESSION OCCURRED 

1572
00:53:33,928 --> 00:53:36,028
BUT THEN THE RECESSION OCCURRED 
AND NEARLY 8 MILLION AMERICANS  

1573
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:36,829
AND NEARLY 8 MILLION AMERICANS  
LOST THEIR HOMES.               

1574
00:53:36,831 --> 00:53:38,831
LOST THEIR HOMES.               
SINCE THEN PRICES HAVE AGAIN    

1575
00:53:38,833 --> 00:53:40,232
SINCE THEN PRICES HAVE AGAIN    
RISEN DRAMATICALLY IN PLACES    

1576
00:53:40,234 --> 00:53:42,368
RISEN DRAMATICALLY IN PLACES    
LIKE WEALTHY METRO AREAS,       

1577
00:53:42,370 --> 00:53:46,472
LIKE WEALTHY METRO AREAS,       
ESPECIALLY ALONG THE COASTS.    

1578
00:53:46,474 --> 00:53:47,206
ESPECIALLY ALONG THE COASTS.    
IN 2004, MIDDLE-CLASS HOME      

1579
00:53:47,208 --> 00:53:49,108
IN 2004, MIDDLE-CLASS HOME      
OWNERSHIP RATES STOOD AT ABOUT  

1580
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:50,376
OWNERSHIP RATES STOOD AT ABOUT  
70%.                            

1581
00:53:50,378 --> 00:53:52,678
70%.                            
IN 2016, WE ARE NOW AT ABOUT    

1582
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:53,012
IN 2016, WE ARE NOW AT ABOUT    
60%.

00:53:53,014 --> 00:53:54,613
60%.                            
SO THAT'S ONE AREA OF WEALTH.   

1584
00:53:54,615 --> 00:53:55,915
SO THAT'S ONE AREA OF WEALTH.   
THERE IS ALSO THE ISSUE OF LOW  

1585
00:53:55,917 --> 00:53:56,782
THERE IS ALSO THE ISSUE OF LOW  
PARTICIPATION IN THE STOCK      

1586
00:53:56,784 --> 00:53:57,116
PARTICIPATION IN THE STOCK      
MARKET.

WE TALK A LOT ABOUT THE STOCK

THE PRESIDENT TALKS A LOT ABOUT 

1590
00:54:00,855 --> 00:54:02,888
THE PRESIDENT TALKS A LOT ABOUT 
THE STOCK MARKET, BUT THE       

1591
00:54:02,890 --> 00:54:04,356
THE STOCK MARKET, BUT THE       
PROPORTION OF MIDDLE-INCOME     

1592
00:54:04,358 --> 00:54:05,991
PROPORTION OF MIDDLE-INCOME     
HOUSEHOLDS THAT OWNS SHARES HAS 

1593
00:54:05,993 --> 00:54:08,360
HOUSEHOLDS THAT OWNS SHARES HAS 
ACTUALLY DECLINED.              

1594
00:54:08,362 --> 00:54:09,795
ACTUALLY DECLINED.              
IN 200756% OF MIDDLE CLASS      

1595
00:54:09,797 --> 00:54:11,463
IN 200756% OF MIDDLE CLASS      
AMERICANS OWNED SHARES.         

1596
00:54:11,465 --> 00:54:14,033
AMERICANS OWNED SHARES.         
AND BY THE WAY IN 2016, THAT    

1597
00:54:14,035 --> 00:54:16,468
AND BY THE WAY IN 2016, THAT    
DROPPED TO 50%.                 

1598
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:17,803
DROPPED TO 50%.                 
THIS DECLINE IS ATTRIBUTED TO   

1599
00:54:17,805 --> 00:54:19,138
THIS DECLINE IS ATTRIBUTED TO   
MORE MIDDLE-INCOME WORKERS      

1600
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:20,539
MORE MIDDLE-INCOME WORKERS      
TAKING JOBS THAT DON'T HAVE     

1601
00:54:20,541 --> 00:54:22,408
TAKING JOBS THAT DON'T HAVE     
RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLANS AS WELL

1602
00:54:22,410 --> 00:54:24,376
RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLANS AS WELL
AS EXPENSES LIKE HEALTH CARE AND

1603
00:54:24,378 --> 00:54:26,946
AS EXPENSES LIKE HEALTH CARE AND
STUDENT LOAN DEBT WHICH ARE     

1604
00:54:26,948 --> 00:54:28,514
STUDENT LOAN DEBT WHICH ARE     
TAKING THOSE BILLS, THAT MONEY, 

1605
00:54:28,516 --> 00:54:29,949
TAKING THOSE BILLS, THAT MONEY, 
THAT WOULD HAVE GONE TO         

1606
00:54:29,951 --> 00:54:30,950
THAT WOULD HAVE GONE TO         
INVESTMENT.                     

1607
00:54:30,952 --> 00:54:32,017
INVESTMENT.                     
NOW COMPARE THAT INVESTMENT RATE

1608
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:33,786
NOW COMPARE THAT INVESTMENT RATE
TO THE TOP 10%.                 

1609
00:54:33,788 --> 00:54:36,188
TO THE TOP 10%.                 
ALMOST EVERYBODY IN THE TOP 10% 

1610
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:37,923
ALMOST EVERYBODY IN THE TOP 10% 
OWNS STOCK.                     

1611
00:54:37,925 --> 00:54:40,326
OWNS STOCK.                     
IN 2007 THE NUMBER WAS 93%.     

1612
00:54:40,328 --> 00:54:44,897
IN 2007 THE NUMBER WAS 93%.     
IT IS UP TO THE 95% IN 2016.    

1613
00:54:44,899 --> 00:54:46,098
IT IS UP TO THE 95% IN 2016.    
SO THIS IS WEALTH DISPARITY.    

1614
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:48,367
SO THIS IS WEALTH DISPARITY.

UNTIL SAY THE GREAT RECESSION,  
YOU SEE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE  

1890
01:04:40,861 --> 01:04:41,927
YOU SEE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE  
IN INEQUALITY.

YEARS INEQUALITY GROWTH HAS     

1893
01:04:45,766 --> 01:04:47,232
YEARS INEQUALITY GROWTH HAS     
ACTUALLY FLATTENED AND IT MAY

AT THE SAME TIME AS INEQUALITY  
WAS SOARING DURING THE 1990s,   

1899
01:04:56,209 --> 01:04:58,476
WAS SOARING DURING THE 1990s,   
PEOPLE WEREN'T CONCERNED ABOUT

ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT HOW THEY ARE

SO IN THE '90s.                 

1906
01:05:03,884 --> 01:05:06,117
SO IN THE '90s.                 
SO ONE OF THE DIFFERENCES WAS IF

1907
01:05:06,119 --> 01:05:08,553
SO ONE OF THE DIFFERENCES WAS IF
EVERYBODY'S SORT OF GOING UP AT

CONTROL ROOM HAS THE SAME       

1910
01:05:11,825 --> 01:05:14,426
CONTROL ROOM HAS THE SAME       
NUMBERS THAT I PUT UP WITH      

1911
01:05:14,428 --> 01:05:16,027
NUMBERS THAT I PUT UP WITH      
HEATHER LONG SINCE THE '80s AND 

1912
01:05:16,029 --> 01:05:16,995
HEATHER LONG SINCE THE '80s AND 
THE '90s.                       

1913
01:05:16,997 --> 01:05:18,830
THE '90s.                       
WHEN YOU'VE GOT RELATIVE        

1914
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:20,031
WHEN YOU'VE GOT RELATIVE        
FLATNESS AND EVEN DECLINE       

1915
01:05:20,033 --> 01:05:21,166
FLATNESS AND EVEN DECLINE       
AMONGST THE BOTTOM 50% THAT,    

1916
01:05:21,168 --> 01:05:23,868
AMONGST THE BOTTOM 50% THAT,    
DOESN'T FEEL LIKE YOU'RE DOING  

1917
01:05:23,870 --> 01:05:24,202
DOESN'T FEEL LIKE YOU'RE DOING  
BETTER.                         

1918
01:05:24,204 --> 01:05:25,103
BETTER.                         
>> YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.          

1919
01:05:25,105 --> 01:05:28,139
>> YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.          
AND WHEN WE HAD THIS MASSIVE    

1920
01:05:28,141 --> 01:05:31,176
AND WHEN WE HAD THIS MASSIVE    
FINANCIAL CRISIS, THIS SERIOUS  

1921
01:05:31,178 --> 01:05:33,845
FINANCIAL CRISIS, THIS SERIOUS  
RECESSION, AND THEN WE HAD A    

1922
01:05:33,847 --> 01:05:35,413
RECESSION, AND THEN WE HAD A    
RECOVERY THAT WAS SLOW.         

1923
01:05:35,415 --> 01:05:36,681
RECOVERY THAT WAS SLOW.         
THAT'S TYPICAL FOLLOWING        

1924
01:05:36,683 --> 01:05:38,083
THAT'S TYPICAL FOLLOWING        
RECESSIONS AS SEVERE AS THIS    

1925
01:05:38,085 --> 01:05:38,350
RECESSIONS AS SEVERE AS THIS    
ONE.                            

1926
01:05:38,352 --> 01:05:40,552
ONE.                            
BUT FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND     

1927
01:05:40,554 --> 01:05:43,588
BUT FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND     
YEARS, WE HAD SLOW AND          

1928
01:05:43,590 --> 01:05:44,522
YEARS, WE HAD SLOW AND          
NONACCELERATING WAGE GROWTH.    

1929
01:05:44,524 --> 01:05:47,692
NONACCELERATING WAGE GROWTH.    
AND OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS,    

1930
01:05:47,694 --> 01:05:49,761
AND OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS,    
THAT'S CHANGED THANK GOODNESS.  

1931
01:05:49,763 --> 01:05:52,430
THAT'S CHANGED THANK GOODNESS.  
AND MY SENSE IS THAT IF WE HAVE 

1932
01:05:52,432 --> 01:05:54,866
AND MY SENSE IS THAT IF WE HAVE 
A LONG ENOUGH PERIOD WHERE WAGES

1933
01:05:54,868 --> 01:05:56,868
A LONG ENOUGH PERIOD WHERE WAGES
FOR TYPICAL WORKERS ARE GROWING 

1934
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:59,904
FOR TYPICAL WORKERS ARE GROWING 
AT A DECENT CLIP, THAT SOME OF  

1935
01:05:59,906 --> 01:06:01,506
AT A DECENT CLIP, THAT SOME OF  
THIS CONCERN THAT WE'RE SEEING  

1936
01:06:01,508 --> 01:06:02,641
THIS CONCERN THAT WE'RE SEEING  
WILL DIE DOWN.                  

1937
01:06:02,643 --> 01:06:04,042
WILL DIE DOWN.                  
>> I HEAR YOUR ARGUMENT.        

1938
01:06:04,044 --> 01:06:05,377
>> I HEAR YOUR ARGUMENT.        
ARE YOU WORRIED THAT GIVEN HOW  

1939
01:06:05,379 --> 01:06:06,945
ARE YOU WORRIED THAT GIVEN HOW  
LONG WE'RE INTO THIS EXPANSION  

1940
01:06:06,947 --> 01:06:09,114
LONG WE'RE INTO THIS EXPANSION  
THAT JUST BY NATURAL CAUSES IT  

1941
01:06:09,116 --> 01:06:10,815
THAT JUST BY NATURAL CAUSES IT  
WILL SLOW DOWN AND WE WON'T GET 

1942
01:06:10,817 --> 01:06:12,417
WILL SLOW DOWN AND WE WON'T GET 
THAT CONTINUED WAGE GROWTH?     

1943
01:06:12,419 --> 01:06:13,885
THAT CONTINUED WAGE GROWTH?     
BECAUSE IT'S ONLY REALLY SINCE  

1944
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:15,520
BECAUSE IT'S ONLY REALLY SINCE  
ABOUT 2015 THAT WE'VE SEEN A    

1945
01:06:15,522 --> 01:06:16,154
ABOUT 2015 THAT WE'VE SEEN A    
NICE BUMP.                      

1946
01:06:16,156 --> 01:06:17,856
NICE BUMP.                      
WE'VE SEEN SOME OF THAT EXTRA   

1947
01:06:17,858 --> 01:06:19,357
WE'VE SEEN SOME OF THAT EXTRA   
CAPACITY IN THE LABOR MARKET GO 

1948
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:20,725
CAPACITY IN THE LABOR MARKET GO 
AWAY, AND PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY   

1949
01:06:20,727 --> 01:06:22,027
AWAY, AND PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY   
GETTING RAISES.                 

1950
01:06:22,029 --> 01:06:22,627
GETTING RAISES.                 
>> YEAH.                        

1951
01:06:22,629 --> 01:06:24,829
>> YEAH.                        
I AM WORRIED ABOUT THAT.        

1952
01:06:24,831 --> 01:06:26,665
I AM WORRIED ABOUT THAT.        
AND THAT ACTUALLY TIES IN NICELY

1953
01:06:26,667 --> 01:06:27,932
AND THAT ACTUALLY TIES IN NICELY
WITH WHAT WE LEARNED THIS       

1954
01:06:27,934 --> 01:06:28,266
WITH WHAT WE LEARNED THIS       
MORNING.                        

1955
01:06:28,268 --> 01:06:30,669
MORNING.                        
YOU KNOW, AGAIN, A SOLID MONTH, 

1956
01:06:30,671 --> 01:06:34,773
YOU KNOW, AGAIN, A SOLID MONTH, 
BUT IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT 2019 IS 

1957
01:06:34,775 --> 01:06:36,307
BUT IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT 2019 IS 
GOING TO BE A SLOWER YEAR FOR   

1958
01:06:36,309 --> 01:06:38,309
GOING TO BE A SLOWER YEAR FOR   
THE LABOR MARKET THAN 2018.     

1959
01:06:38,311 --> 01:06:40,545
THE LABOR MARKET THAN 2018.     
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE REASONS IS 

1960
01:06:40,547 --> 01:06:41,613
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE REASONS IS 
BECAUSE WE'RE JUST RUNNING OUT  

1961
01:06:41,615 --> 01:06:44,115
BECAUSE WE'RE JUST RUNNING OUT  
OF WORKERS TO BRING IN OFF THE  

1962
01:06:44,117 --> 01:06:44,482
OF WORKERS TO BRING IN OFF THE  
SIDELINES.                      

1963
01:06:44,484 --> 01:06:46,685
SIDELINES.                      
WE SAW THE LABOR FORCE          

1964
01:06:46,687 --> 01:06:48,219
WE SAW THE LABOR FORCE          
PARTICIPATION RATE TICK UP THIS 

1965
01:06:48,221 --> 01:06:48,520
PARTICIPATION RATE TICK UP THIS 
MONTH.                          

1966
01:06:48,522 --> 01:06:49,688
MONTH.                          
THAT'S FANTASTIC.               

1967
01:06:49,690 --> 01:06:51,756
THAT'S FANTASTIC.               
BUT THERE'S REALLY ONLY SO HIGH 

1968
01:06:51,758 --> 01:06:52,657
BUT THERE'S REALLY ONLY SO HIGH 
THAT CAN GO.                    

1969
01:06:52,659 --> 01:06:53,758
THAT CAN GO.                    
THERE ARE ONLY SO MANY WORKERS  

1970
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:54,626
THERE ARE ONLY SO MANY WORKERS  
WE CAN BRING BACK IN.           

1971
01:06:54,628 --> 01:06:56,428
WE CAN BRING BACK IN.           
AND AT SOME POINT WE ARE GOING  

1972
01:06:56,430 --> 01:06:58,563
AND AT SOME POINT WE ARE GOING  
TO HAVE ANOTHER RECESSION.      

1973
01:06:58,565 --> 01:06:59,497
TO HAVE ANOTHER RECESSION.      
AND SO I THINK YOUR QUESTION IS 

1974
01:06:59,499 --> 01:07:01,533
AND SO I THINK YOUR QUESTION IS 
A GOOD ONE.                     

1975
01:07:01,535 --> 01:07:04,869
A GOOD ONE.                     
HOW LONG CAN WE KEEP SOLID WAGE 

1976
01:07:04,871 --> 01:07:06,538
HOW LONG CAN WE KEEP SOLID WAGE 
GAINS GOING, AND IF THE ANSWER  

1977
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:08,540
GAINS GOING, AND IF THE ANSWER  
IS NOT THAT MUCH LONGER, THEN   

1978
01:07:08,542 --> 01:07:10,642
IS NOT THAT MUCH LONGER, THEN   
WHAT DOES THAT DO TO KIND OF    

1979
01:07:10,644 --> 01:07:12,310
WHAT DOES THAT DO TO KIND OF    
POLITICS AND WHAT DOES THAT DO  

1980
01:07:12,312 --> 01:07:13,545
POLITICS AND WHAT DOES THAT DO  
TO POPULAR SENTIMENT?           

1981
01:07:13,547 --> 01:07:14,546
TO POPULAR SENTIMENT?           
I THINK THAT'S A RATHER         

1982
01:07:14,548 --> 01:07:15,513
I THINK THAT'S A RATHER         
IMPORTANT QUESTION WE ARE       

1983
01:07:15,515 --> 01:07:15,847
IMPORTANT QUESTION WE ARE

IT RAISES A QUESTION THOUGH.    

2139
01:11:09,516 --> 01:11:12,350
IT RAISES A QUESTION THOUGH.    
IF THEY HAVE TO START OVER, IF  

2140
01:11:12,352 --> 01:11:13,551
IF THEY HAVE TO START OVER, IF  
THEY SOMEHOW PREVAIL AND ARE

THEY SOMEHOW PREVAIL AND ARE    
ABLE TO ADD THIS QUESTION, COULD

01:11:15,388 --> 01:11:16,754
ABLE TO ADD THIS QUESTION, COULD
THEY TRASH ALL THE STUFF THEY

THEY TRASH ALL THE STUFF THEY   
HAVE PRINTED SO FAR AND START   

2144
01:11:18,224 --> 01:11:18,523
HAVE PRINTED SO FAR AND START

OVER?                           
WOULD THEY HAVE ENOUGH TIME?    

2146
01:11:19,359 --> 01:11:21,359
WOULD THEY HAVE ENOUGH TIME?    
AND I GUESS THE ANSWER IS IF    

2147
01:11:21,361 --> 01:11:26,531
AND I GUESS THE ANSWER IS IF    
THEY HAD ENOUGH MONEY, YES,     

2148
01:11:26,533 --> 01:11:27,231
THEY HAD ENOUGH MONEY, YES,     
THEY'D JUST GET MORE PRINTERS   

2149
01:11:27,233 --> 01:11:27,966
THEY'D JUST GET MORE PRINTERS   
INVOLVED AND COULD PROBABLY GET

I'M JUST NOT SURE WHERE THAT    
MONEY COMES FROM, WHETHER THEY'D

ENOUGH MONEY TO SUBSTANTIALLY

THEY ARE MEDIA COMPANIES.       
THEY HAVE MADE TONS OF MONEY OFF

2643
01:27:13,612 --> 01:27:14,177
THEY HAVE MADE TONS OF MONEY OFF
INDIVIDUALS.

01:27:14,179 --> 01:27:16,480

ONE OF THE FEW BIPARTISAN BILLS 

2645
01:27:16,482 --> 01:27:18,482
ONE OF THE FEW BIPARTISAN BILLS 
OUT THERE TO DO IT WITH MAKING  

2646
01:27:18,484 --> 01:27:19,583
OUT THERE TO DO IT WITH MAKING  
SURE THAT THERE ARE RULES IN    

2647
01:27:19,585 --> 01:27:21,618
SURE THAT THERE ARE RULES IN    
PLACE SO PEOPLE CAN PROTECT     

2648
01:27:21,620 --> 01:27:22,886
PLACE SO PEOPLE CAN PROTECT     
THEIR PRIVATE DATA IS FIRST.    

2649
01:27:22,888 --> 01:27:24,855
THEIR PRIVATE DATA IS FIRST.    
YOU ALSO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT 

2650
01:27:24,857 --> 01:27:26,256
YOU ALSO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT 
WHEN THEY'RE SHARING DATA THAT  

2651
01:27:26,258 --> 01:27:27,925
WHEN THEY'RE SHARING DATA THAT  
THERE'S RULES ABOUT THAT.       

2652
01:27:27,927 --> 01:27:28,892
THERE'S RULES ABOUT THAT.       
AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THEY   

2653
01:27:28,894 --> 01:27:31,261
AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THEY   
HAVE TO PAY A FEE, A TAX, SO    

2654
01:27:31,263 --> 01:27:33,230
HAVE TO PAY A FEE, A TAX, SO    
THAT MONEY CAN GO BACK INTO OUR 

2655
01:27:33,232 --> 01:27:34,564
THAT MONEY CAN GO BACK INTO OUR 
NATION'S CYBERSECURITY TO       

2656
01:27:34,566 --> 01:27:35,032
NATION'S CYBERSECURITY TO       
PROTECT US.

01:27:35,034 --> 01:27:37,801
PROTECT US.                     
AND THE THIRD THING IS ALL ABOUT

2658
01:27:37,803 --> 01:27:38,168
AND THE THIRD THING IS ALL ABOUT
DEMOCRACY.                      

2659
01:27:38,170 --> 01:27:39,703
DEMOCRACY.                      
IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING ABOUT

2661
01:27:41,206 --> 01:27:43,740
THIS BEFORE THE NEXT ELECTION,  
WHEN WE HAVE A PRESIDENT SENDING

SO MAKING THOSE COMPANIES PUT

01:27:58,357 --> 01:27:59,990
SO MAKING THOSE COMPANIES PUT   
SOME RULES OF THE ROAD IN PLACE

SOME RULES OF THE ROAD IN PLACE 
WHEN IT COMES TO WHO'S BUYING

SAFETY NEED FOR THESE RAIDS?    

2923
01:36:42,180 --> 01:36:44,447
SAFETY NEED FOR THESE RAIDS?

THE PROBLEM HERE IS THIS.       

2926
01:36:46,284 --> 01:36:48,051
THE PROBLEM HERE IS THIS.       
THE PRESIDENT WANTS BIG NUMBERS.

2927
01:36:48,053 --> 01:36:49,452
THE PRESIDENT WANTS BIG NUMBERS.
BUT TO GET BIG NUMBERS WHAT,    

2928
01:36:49,454 --> 01:36:51,387
BUT TO GET BIG NUMBERS WHAT,    
THAT REQUIRES TYPICALLY IS YOU

2936
01:37:02,767 --> 01:37:04,701
USING ALIASES.                  
IT TAKES MUCH MORE LEG WORK THAN

IT TAKES MUCH MORE LEG WORK THAN
IT DOES A FAMILY WITH CHILDREN

01:47:24,689 --> 01:47:26,422
SO THE QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU   
GET THAT ELECTRICITY FROM THE

I WOULD SAY ONE OF THE MAJOR    

3237
01:47:41,272 --> 01:47:42,271
I WOULD SAY ONE OF THE MAJOR    
HEADWINDS ARE ELECTRIC UTILITIES

3238
01:47:42,273 --> 01:47:43,639
HEADWINDS ARE ELECTRIC UTILITIES
AND GENERATORS WHO DON'T WANT   

3239

TO MAKE THIS CHANGE BECAUSE THAT
WOULD MEAN LESS OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:47:54,485 --> 01:47:54,783
WOULD MEAN LESS OPPORTUNITY FOR 
THEM.

3505
01:59:09,860 --> 01:59:11,960
              And then we got   
              to meet him after,
              which was like... 

3506
01:59:11,995 --> 01:59:12,961

   Like thousands of tickets    
          to concerts,          

3511
01:59:20,537 --> 01:59:22,304
  festivals and private shows.
