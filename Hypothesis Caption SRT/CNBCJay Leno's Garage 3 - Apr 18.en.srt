         - There we go.         
     Jay, your new Ford GT.     

125
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:54,793
  - Well, thank you very much.  
     - Congratulations, sir.    

126
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:57,095
   - I'll get you a check as--  
      in a couple of weeks.     

127
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:58,597
      Don't worry about it.     

128
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:01,166
   Yeah, it's pretty amazing.   
   Yeah, it just looks great.   

129
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:03,468
 - This was designed, you know, 
    to celebrate our heritage   

130
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,137
        and to celebrate        
    what's all behind the GT,   

131
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:07,306
   and at the same time we had  
   to make sure that this car   

132
00:05:07,408 --> 00:05:08,807
       was everything that      
         it needed to be        

133
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:10,742
     to win a historic race     
          like Le Mans.         

134
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:12,010
     - You know what's great    
          about it is,          

135
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:14,012
     it's an actual racecar     
         for the street.        

136
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:15,647
     I mean, a lot of people    
         use that term,         

137
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:18,016
    but this was designed for   
   track first, street second,  

138
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:19,217
   and it's all aerodynamics.   

139
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,552
      That's really the key     
          to this car.          

140
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,187
     - Oh, this whole car's     
       about aerodynamics.      

141
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:23,755
 - I mean, you can literally see
  how the air goes through it,  

142
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:27,492
through up here, it cuts through
     here, this is amazing.     

143
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:29,528
   - Well, you know what a lot  
   of people don't know, Jay?   

144
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:33,165
This is not just beautiful, this
 wing, but it's also functional.

145
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:34,733
           - Like me.           
           - [laughs]           

146
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,368
    So the air is coming in.    
            - Right.            

147
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,236
  - And it's going through the  
 turbo, and it's getting cooled,

148
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:40,205
    but then that charged air   
   is coming up through here,   

149
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:42,074
  actually through this piece,  
     and feeding the motor.     

150
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:43,208
             - Okay.            
    - And it's all been made    

151
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,476
     to increase downforce,     

152
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:46,178
          reduce drag,          
      and make this quick.      

153
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,880
    She achieves a top speed,   
   Jay, of 216 miles an hour.   

154
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:51,983
    - Wow, that's faster than   
      many, many supercars.     

155
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:53,385
       - It is, actually.       

156
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:54,886
      The McLaren does 205,     
     is what they've stated.    

157
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:56,321
         - Right, right.        
        - The Ferrari 458       

158
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:57,923
        does 205 as well.       

159
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:01,526
- So if I'm on the 405 with this
  and the McLaren is going 205, 

160
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:02,961
     I can easily pass them.    

161
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:04,129
   - You can easily pass them.  
       - Yeah, yeah, yeah.      

162
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:05,630
       So it's practical.       

163
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:06,932
  - You've been known to get up 
    to that speed on the 405.   

164
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:08,300
        - It's practical.       

165
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:11,737
    Honey, we can get to your   
    mom's house much quicker.   

166
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,772
   <i> Let me tell you something,</i>  
    <i> it's really a privilege</i>    

167
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,173
      <i> to have one of these</i>     

168
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:17,275
       <i> 'cause this is not</i>      
      <i> an easy car to get.</i>      

169
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:18,577
 This is probably the first time
         in the history         

170
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:19,811
      of the motor company      

171
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:21,546
        that it had to be       
    preapproved to get a car.   

172
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:25,250
     - We had roughly 6,800     
    applicants for 500 cars,    

173
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:26,651
     so the demand was high,    

174
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:28,387
   but we wanted to make sure   
       that this ended up       

175
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:29,788
     in the hands of people     

176
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,956
        who were gonna do       
  the right thing with the car. 

177
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,224
            - Right.            
     - We don't want people     

178
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:33,625
     to buy it and flip it.     
         - Right, right.        

179
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,227
- You know, we don't want people
        just to put them        

180
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:36,695
   in--in a museum somewhere.   
 We want them out on the street.

181
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:37,696
            - Right.            
  - We want people to take them 

182
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:39,097
     to car shows, so yeah,     

183
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,565
     the application process    
     was--was very lengthy.     

184
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:41,900
      - Oh, and the number      
 of celebrities that called me, 

185
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:43,301
   "Leno, can you get--get me   
          on that list!         

186
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:44,569
    Why aren't I on that l--"   

187
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:45,871
        just furious that       
    they weren't on the list,   

188
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:47,172
           and I said,          
   "Well, you know, your Lambo  

189
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:48,473
       and your Ferrari's       
    not gonna help you here."   

190
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,108
        - Yeah, exactly.        
  We want to reward the people  

191
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,377
      that have been loyal      
     to Ford, and that's...     

192
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,712
          - Thank you.          
         - There you go.        

193
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:55,480
      - Since the first day     
    I rolled my mom's Falcon,   

194
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,649
       I have been there,       
    you know what I'm saying?   

195
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,184
           Very cool.           

196
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:01,253
   <i> All right, enough talking.</i>  
    <i> Let's drive this thing.</i>    

197
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:03,255
       [engine turns over]

00:07:03,357 --> 00:07:05,323
        [engine revving]        

199
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:07,159
       - Rotate that dial       
         to track mode.         

200
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:08,260
          - Track mode?         

201
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:12,063
 You get right there, don't you?

202
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,532
     - You're hunkered down,    
   and you're ready to go out   

203
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:14,833
      and attack the track.     

204
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:32,117
    The grip is unbelievable.   

205
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:34,453
 You keep thinking you're gonna 
   slide, but you don't slide.  

206
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:35,654
        - No, you do not.       

207
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:41,626
   This thing just pulls like   
  a freight train, doesn't it?  

208
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:43,995
        - It really does.       
  - This feels like a racecar.  

209
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:46,431
   - I was gonna say, it's as   
   comfortable as a road car.   

210
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:47,632
             - Yes.             

211
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:48,834
          - I feel like         
    we're doing one of those    

212
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:50,435
          Doublemint--          
     it's two mints in one!     

213
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:51,536
           - [laughs]           

214
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:56,208
       - This is so smooth      
          and seamless.         

215
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,442
      - As soon as you hit      
          the throttle,         

216
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:59,244
   it's instantaneous torque.   

217
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:01,313
     It's not some big event    
          that happens,         

218
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:02,681
    but you're rocketing off.

00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:50,188
   Is that--that seems like it  
 would be the highlight. Is it? 

257
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,756
         - It is, yeah.         
        That's a big one.       

258
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:53,291
     I mean, Le Mans really     
      is a different race.      

259
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:55,527
     It's a very fast track.    
       It's wet and dark.       

260
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:57,228
 I mean, there's so many things 
    that can go against you.    

261
00:09:57,331 --> 00:10:00,065
In the GTLM class we were racing
   each other the whole time.   

262
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:01,299
             - Yeah.            
 - I mean, I passed the Ferrari 

263
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:02,867
  at the beginning of the race, 

264
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,470
and I passed the Ferrari for the
last time with four hours to go,

265
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:07,272
         and everything         
     in between was a race.     

266
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:10,275
   It was--it was no cruising,  
      so I mean, that race,     

267
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:11,843
  it just--it's one that makes  
 your eyes pop out of your head.

268
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,445
        It's like driving

307
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:27,185

      really good wheelman.     

311
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:33,558

    the French are gonna say,

     "Bourdais is the winner    
          of the race,"

317

     This is the very first     
         generation car.        

713
00:30:30,229 --> 00:30:32,663
      Pretty clean design.      

714
00:30:32,765 --> 00:30:35,599
    - This is a gorgeous car.   
    - Well, you ready to try    

715
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:36,967
  and relive some old memories? 

716
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:38,735
      - Yeah, do I have to      
    take you along or can I--   

717
00:30:38,838 --> 00:30:40,838
       - Yeah, I'm sorry,       
     that's quite--legally,     

718
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,806
      you have to take me.      
 I was thinking the same thing, 

719
00:30:42,908 --> 00:30:44,541
            but hey,            
   this is what we got to do.   

720

       [engine turns over]      

722
00:30:48,214 --> 00:30:50,314
    - Oh, yeah, that's nice.    

723
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:01,692
 - Bring back some memories when
  you step on that accelerator? 

724
00:31:01,794 --> 00:31:02,993
      - Oh, that's lovely.      

725
00:31:03,095 --> 00:31:05,262
  This is a nice-handling car.  
          It still is.          

726
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:06,563
  - Now, when you got your NSX, 

727
00:31:06,665 --> 00:31:08,465
         did you realize        
      the importance of it?     

728
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:12,135
     - I hate to admit that     
  in front of this many cameras 

729
00:31:12,238 --> 00:31:13,370
      next to my old friend     

730
00:31:13,472 --> 00:31:16,206
 Jay Leno, but no, not at first.

731
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:17,374
        I was a body man.       

732
00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:20,043
          I just loved          
      the look of the car.

736
00:31:25,918 --> 00:31:28,018
         I remember once        
      you rode a motorcycle     

737
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,486
     on "The Tonight Show."     

738
00:31:29,588 --> 00:31:32,055
       - That's very true.      
  I rode the bike onto the set, 

739
00:31:32,157 --> 00:31:34,925
   thereby enhancing my image   
           as a rebel.          

740
00:31:35,027 --> 00:31:36,126
             - Yeah.            
             - Yeah.            

741
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:38,295
        In the early days       
    I was up against Johnny.    

742
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:40,831
     It didn't change much,     
     frankly, you or Johnny.    

743
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:42,699
           Both of you          
    beat the crap out of us.    

744
00:31:42,801 --> 00:31:45,135
      - Yeah, but you were      
     doing important stuff.     

745
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:47,137
         - In many ways         
    I feel like Forrest Gump    

746
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:50,274
   because I was with Mandela   
   when he came out of prison.  

747
00:31:50,376 --> 00:31:52,676
      I was in the Kremlin      
         with Gorbachev         

748
00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:55,479
 the day the Soviet Union ended.

749
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:58,215
   - Wow, actually, Gorbachev   
   told me a very funny story,  

750
00:31:58,317 --> 00:32:01,418
       which is, there was      
   a line of people in Russia,  

751
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,087
         and they'd been        
    waiting hours for bread,    

752
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:06,456
      and one Russian said,     
       "I hate this line.       

753
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:08,392
   You know what I want to do?  
   I want to kill Gorbachev."   

754
00:32:08,494 --> 00:32:10,360
              Hey,              
  and everybody in the line...  

755
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:11,795
       Three hours later,       
       the guy comes back.      

756
00:32:11,897 --> 00:32:13,363
   They said, "What happened?   
      You kill Gorbachev?"      

757
00:32:13,465 --> 00:32:15,098
     He said, "No, that line    
   was longer than this one."   

758
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,466
         [both laughing]        

759
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:18,368
       I thought that was       
       a pretty good joke.      

760
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,403
        - That's not bad.       

761
00:32:19,505 --> 00:32:20,437
    - Well, for a communist,    
            come on.            

762
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:21,705
        - Yeah, not bad.        

763
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:23,340
         Do you remember        
    the old John Wayne story?   

764
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:25,309
        He had this agent       
      by the name of Manny,     

765
00:32:25,411 --> 00:32:28,412
 and periodically they'd go out,
 they'd have four or five beers.

766
00:32:28,514 --> 00:32:29,579
            - Right.            
      - John Wayne would go     

767
00:32:29,682 --> 00:32:30,981
        to the bathroom,        
       and he'd come back,      

768
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:32,249
       and there'd always       
       be the same thing,       

769
00:32:32,351 --> 00:32:34,017
      his white trouser leg     
          soaking wet.          

770
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,486
  After about 20 years of this, 

771
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:38,088
     Manny's never asked him    
        about it before,        

772
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,289
  and he's--he can't stand it.  

773
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:41,992
            He says,            
 "Duke, what happens in there?" 

774
00:32:42,094 --> 00:32:43,794
            He says,            
  "Well, I'll tell you, Manny.  

775
00:32:43,896 --> 00:32:45,862
          "It's always          
      the same damn thing.      

776
00:32:45,965 --> 00:32:49,599
 "I'll go in there, some dude'll
 stand at the urinal next to me,

777
00:32:49,702 --> 00:32:51,034
  "all of a sudden he looks up, 

778
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:53,203
   and he says, 'Jesus Christ,  
       you're John Wayne.'      

779
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,405
 - Oh, and he pees all over him?

780
00:32:55,507 --> 00:32:58,809
- I was hired to do an interview

781
00:32:58,911 --> 00:33:00,243
       with Bill Clinton,       

782
00:33:00,346 --> 00:33:02,512
     and I tell that story,     
   and then I turn to Clinton   

783
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:05,082
   and say, "That must happen   
      to you all the time,"     

784
00:33:05,184 --> 00:33:09,186
  and he says, "Yeah, except in 
 my case they do it on purpose."

785
00:33:09,288 --> 00:33:12,356
          - [laughing]          
        Oh, that's funny.       

786
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:13,824
      That's a funny story.     

787
00:33:13,926 --> 00:33:17,160
Now, would you rather drive this
    or your Porsche Boxster?    

788
00:33:17,262 --> 00:33:19,329
             - Hmm.             
  I love that Porsche Boxster,  

789
00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:22,099
       but this--this car       
        is very special.        

790
00:33:22,201 --> 00:33:24,568
   - This one does it for you.  
- This one does it for me, yeah.

791
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:27,971
 And it makes me kind of wonder 
 whether I did the right thing. 

792
00:33:28,073 --> 00:33:30,173
    - Well, it's not too late   
to go back and find another one.

793
00:33:30,275 --> 00:33:31,441
      - That's true, yeah.

 This episode, we want to learn 
 about appraising a modern car. 

1201
00:51:38,396 --> 00:51:39,528
      What goes into that?      

1202
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:42,731
 This is a 2008 Dodge Viper ACR,
            correct?            

1203
00:51:42,834 --> 00:51:45,301
      - Yes, this is a car      
    that is practically new,    

1204
00:51:45,403 --> 00:51:47,203
   so what I'm looking for is,  

1205
00:51:47,305 --> 00:51:49,472
    what exactly is the story   
      that it's telling us?     

1206
00:51:49,574 --> 00:51:51,974
         ACR stands for         
      American Club Racer.      

1207
00:51:52,076 --> 00:51:54,343
 This is a Viper for the track. 

1208
00:51:54,445 --> 00:51:55,644
 - Right, and this was, I think,

1209
00:51:55,746 --> 00:51:57,580
         the first year         
   of the ACR, correct, 2008?   

1210
00:51:57,682 --> 00:51:59,715
     - It was the first year    
of the ACR, limited edition car,

1211
00:51:59,817 --> 00:52:01,383
       and cars like this,      
        high-performance,       

1212
00:52:01,486 --> 00:52:04,453
 late-model cars are frequently 
      valued in the market      

1213
00:52:04,555 --> 00:52:06,188
        by their mileage        
        or lack thereof.        

1214
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:07,890
       - All right, well,       
    let's bring the owner in.   

1215
00:52:07,992 --> 00:52:09,758
    His name is Jeff Dunham,    
     a very funny comedian.     

1216
00:52:09,861 --> 00:52:12,628
  Jeff plays clubs and theaters 
     all across the country.    

1217
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:13,996
       - How are you, Jay?      
        Good to see you.        

1218
00:52:14,098 --> 00:52:15,264
    Donald, good to see you.    
     - Hey, good to see you.    

1219
00:52:15,366 --> 00:52:17,533
       - Did you buy this       
       as a collector car?      

1220
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:19,602
       Did you buy it just      
   as a fun car for the road?   

1221
00:52:19,704 --> 00:52:21,437
 Did you buy it as a track car? 
      What was your reason?     

1222
00:52:21,539 --> 00:52:22,771
   - It was all of the above,   
            actually,           

1223
00:52:22,874 --> 00:52:24,140
    and you don't know this,    
           but working          

1224
00:52:24,242 --> 00:52:25,975
      the Comedy Magic Club     
     down in Hermosa Beach,     

1225
00:52:26,077 --> 00:52:27,676
   you brought your '93 Viper   
             there,             

1226
00:52:27,778 --> 00:52:29,578
         and that's when        
   I fell in love with Vipers.  

1227
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,247
       - Oh, that's right.      
  You were just four years old, 

1228
00:52:31,349 --> 00:52:32,548
         as I remember.         

1229
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:33,749
         - That's right.        
     - I remember picking up    

1230
00:52:33,851 --> 00:52:35,584
           a young buy          
    and the policeman saying,   

1231
00:52:35,686 --> 00:52:36,886
         "Put him down."        
          That was you.         

1232
00:52:36,988 --> 00:52:38,220
         - That was me.         
          - Yeah, yeah.         

1233
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:40,656
     - So, the Dodge Viper,     
      the '94 was actually      

1234
00:52:40,758 --> 00:52:43,292
    the first really nice car   
         that I bought,         

1235
00:52:43,394 --> 00:52:46,162
and this thing came up for sale,
    and I'd never had an ACR    

1236
00:52:46,264 --> 00:52:48,264
    and thought this sounded    
       like a lot of fun.       

1237
00:52:48,366 --> 00:52:50,900
    This car's sticker price    
          was 102,000,          

1238
00:52:51,002 --> 00:52:52,201
    and I paid 85,000 for it.   

1239
00:52:52,303 --> 00:52:53,636
       - You had the '94,       

1240
00:52:53,738 --> 00:52:56,338
    and then you buy sort of    
   a race version of your '94.  

1241
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,339
            - Right.            
         - Do you notice        

1242
00:52:57,441 --> 00:52:58,607
a huge difference on the street?

1243
00:52:58,709 --> 00:53:00,676
 - This is completely different.
            - Really?           

1244
00:53:00,778 --> 00:53:02,178
    - Because this isn't just   
             an ACR.            

1245
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,812
    This is the hardcore ACR,   

1246
00:53:03,915 --> 00:53:06,048
    so this 80 pounds lighter   
         than the coupe.        

1247
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:08,217
     This thing is a monster    
          all the time.         

1248
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:10,920
     - Well, the first thing    
      I noticed, of course,     

1249
00:53:11,022 --> 00:53:12,955
         as we discussed        
     about low-mileage cars,    

1250
00:53:13,057 --> 00:53:16,325
    this car has 454 miles on   
the odometer when I examined it.

1251
00:53:16,427 --> 00:53:17,860
          - 454 miles?          

1252
00:53:17,962 --> 00:53:19,195
  Is your wife still a virgin?  

1253
00:53:19,297 --> 00:53:20,563
           - [laughs]           

1254
00:53:20,665 --> 00:53:22,231
              - So,             
  this is how I look at any car 

1255
00:53:22,333 --> 00:53:24,233
        that I appraise.        
    You look at basic things.   

1256
00:53:24,335 --> 00:53:26,669
   For instance, you obviously  
      start with the body.      

1257
00:53:26,771 --> 00:53:28,470
          The panel fit         
     is actually very good.     

1258
00:53:28,573 --> 00:53:29,905
       The panel condition      
          is excellent,         

1259
00:53:30,007 --> 00:53:31,340
         and considering        
       the way it's built,      

1260
00:53:31,442 --> 00:53:33,008
     I'm very surprised that    
    there's not more damage,    

1261
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:34,877
   but there is a little chip   

1262
00:53:34,979 --> 00:53:36,478
        out of the bottom       
      of the spoiler here,      

1263
00:53:36,581 --> 00:53:37,947
      which I'm sure, Jeff,     
         at some point,         

1264
00:53:38,049 --> 00:53:39,381
         caught the edge        
    of a driveway somewhere.    

1265
00:53:39,483 --> 00:53:40,883
           - You know,          
   this is why many appraisers  

1266
00:53:40,985 --> 00:53:42,851
   are often beaten to death.   

1267
00:53:42,954 --> 00:53:44,153
     - And those are called     
           rub strips.          

1268
00:53:44,255 --> 00:53:45,621
  You're supposed to rub them.  

1269
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:47,256
 - Absolutely, they're actually 
       designed to bolt in      

1270
00:53:47,358 --> 00:53:48,958
    and bolt out very easily    
    so you can replace those.   

1271
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:50,392
  - Now, if this was your car,  

1272
00:53:50,494 --> 00:53:52,294
      would you replace it      
  because of that little chip?  

1273
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:54,029
        - Absolutely not.       
   In fact, if it were my car,  

1274
00:53:54,131 --> 00:53:56,131
       it'd have more than      
        454 miles on it.        

1275
00:53:56,234 --> 00:53:58,067
   But the car has been used.   

1276
00:53:58,169 --> 00:54:00,636
     There's a small scratch    
        here on the sill.       

1277
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:03,172
Someone getting in scraped their
  heel, and there's a slight--  

1278
00:54:03,274 --> 00:54:04,273
     - Excuse me, excuse me.    
          - Yeah, sir?          

1279
00:54:04,375 --> 00:54:05,374
       - Hold on a second.      

1280
00:54:09,046 --> 00:54:11,347
      - Let the record show     
        that that did not       

1281
00:54:11,449 --> 00:54:13,249
   actually cover the scratch,  

1282
00:54:13,351 --> 00:54:15,484
       and--but I noticed       
         on the chassis         

1283
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:16,685
  there's some light road dust, 

1284
00:54:16,787 --> 00:54:19,054
     as well as a dead moth     
        on the radiator.        

1285
00:54:19,156 --> 00:54:20,556
          - I thought--         
 - You know, you are so screwed.

1286
00:54:20,658 --> 00:54:23,459
    - I thought I liked him.    
  I don't like Donald anymore.  

1287
00:54:23,561 --> 00:54:26,829
   - But things like this are   
  the challenges of appraising  

1288
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:30,499
a basically new car because I am
  picking the tiniest of nits.  

1289
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:33,802
  - Right, couldn't you do this 
      to the moth, really,      

1290
00:54:33,904 --> 00:54:35,437
  and that would be pretty much 
     the end of the problem?    

1291
00:54:35,539 --> 00:54:37,740
 - I'm not allowed to intervene.
           I observe.           

1292
00:54:37,842 --> 00:54:38,941
  - So if the car was on fire,  

1293
00:54:39,043 --> 00:54:40,209
      you wouldn't pick up      
        an extinguisher?        

1294
00:54:40,311 --> 00:54:41,944
     - I would make a note.     
         - That's just--
