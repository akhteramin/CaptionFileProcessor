    Let's get you caught up.

   and are on the up and up.

in their ass that won't go away.

 Chad and Nicole's relationship

         Wow, you (bleep) it up.
         I had it.              
No, here.                       
I got it.                       

16
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:45,945
I'm gonna measure it for you,   
you (bleep) ding-a-ling.        

17
00:00:46,013 --> 00:00:48,981

  Janelle's still running hot   
    after attacking Diandra     

18
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,083
   for kissing her ex Darian.   

19
00:00:51,152 --> 00:00:53,786
  And Farrah's discovering her  
       ripped-up posters,       

20
00:00:53,855 --> 00:00:57,323
   which was payback by Nurys   
for being kicked in the cooter. 

21
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:01,160
Oh, my God.                     
Someone came up here            
and (bleep) up my signs.        

22
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:03,729
All right, so that's            
the (bleep) you started!        

23
00:01:03,798 --> 00:01:05,331
Did she (bleep) do this?        

24
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,867
                 She might have 
                 did it, Farrah.
Okay.                           

25
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:10,803
     Well, this is the best one.

All right.                      

27
00:01:15,243 --> 00:01:20,980
Don't attack all of my amazing, 
        amazing signs...        

28
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:24,650
    that my housemates spent    
  their time on making for me.  

29
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,187
Did someone have an idea        
to (bleep) bend all my signs?   

30
00:01:28,256 --> 00:01:31,757
■    I (bleep) did! I did!

32
00:01:34,662 --> 00:01:37,630
         She kicked me.         
       She decided to put       
        her hands on me,        

33
00:01:37,699 --> 00:01:41,267
        so I grabbed her        
     "free Farrah" posters      
   and I ripped them in half.   

34
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:42,968

  You think I give a (bleep)?   

35

You think I give a (bleep)?     
                 No, no, no, no!
                 Nurys, no!

39
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,745

47
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:12,131

she ripped it all up.           

61
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:45,731
   If you argue with Farrah,    
she will kick you in the vagina 

62
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,768
and put your shoes in the toilet

203
00:08:47,663 --> 00:08:49,163
      Yeah, G  because I'm alreG

204
00:08:49,231 --> 00:08:52,099
             with two exes,     
You real flusand now you'reGg i.
right now, like--               

205
00:08:52,168 --> 00:08:54,735
But this connection             
seem genuine right here.        

206
00:08:54,804 --> 00:08:57,471
Even from the other ones,       
I'm feeling something.          

207
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,741
           I think there is     
           a genuine connection,
           but it's difficult   

208
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,644
       because I got some issues
       back at the house.       

209
00:09:03,713 --> 00:09:05,646
Don't play with Jay's feelings. 

210
00:09:05,715 --> 00:09:07,581
 I think that this is something 

211
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,184
     between Jay and Morgan     
that can potentially ruin them. 

212
00:09:10,286 --> 00:09:11,652
We got some things              
to figure out.                  

213
00:09:15,992 --> 00:09:18,926
I'm done.

      a camel on Wednesday.

257
00:12:18,975 --> 00:12:21,776

    Um, I'll go ahead

    told me I need to be honest.

00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,820
 It's like I'm the only person  
        with three exes.        

262
00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:36,491
Some people don't even have one 
 ex and I'm dealing with three. 

263
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:40,194
 Like, I need to get Corey out  
of this house, and he's honestly
         pretty boring.         

264
00:12:40,263 --> 00:12:43,364
Jay came in the house.          
I kind of rekindled things      
with him.                       

265
00:12:43,433 --> 00:12:46,134
Then Corey came in,             
so it was kind of like...       
                  Double whammy.

266
00:12:46,202 --> 00:12:48,236
...a weird messy                
love triangle.                  

267
00:12:48,305 --> 00:12:52,240
But I thought I had it          
figured out till you            
walked up on the beach.         

268
00:12:52,309 --> 00:12:54,309
    Me and Monte had a great    
   relationship before this.    

269
00:12:54,377 --> 00:12:57,078
      It didn't end badly.      
      My family loves him.      

270
00:12:57,147 --> 00:13:00,515
  He's unfortunately the exact  
    kind of guy that my dad     

271
00:13:00,584 --> 00:13:02,617
    would want me to marry,     
      which is terrifying.      

272
00:13:02,686 --> 00:13:05,220
              You're my girl.   
              Everything happens
              for a reason.

00:13:05,288 --> 00:13:07,789
              So I really think,
              you know,         
              Jay might be cool,

274
00:13:07,858 --> 00:13:10,725
         but, you know,         
         you gotta remember back
         to what we had too.    

275
00:13:10,794 --> 00:13:12,527
          We could rekindle that

277
00:13:15,098 --> 00:13:18,266
     he's gonna have to run

      uh, Monte's coming.       

278
00:13:18,335 --> 00:13:20,268

            That's all I ask.

Okay.

  actually, like, I was thinking
  about, like, last night, was, 

285
00:13:42,359 --> 00:13:46,628
 like, no one ever pulled her   
 to the side and was like,      
 "Yo, I understand you're upset,

286
00:13:46,696 --> 00:13:49,664

   comes back from the hotel,   

288
00:13:53,103 --> 00:13:56,971
     I'm hoping to see, uh,     
     a new-- a new person.      

289
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,441
      Uh, the girl that I       
         used to know.          

290
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:01,343
          Here we go.           

291
00:14:01,411 --> 00:14:05,580
              Oh, (bleep)!

Chad, you're safe!              

292
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:08,249
     So Nicole is back now      
  and she doesn't have an ex,   
       and I'm just like,       

293
00:14:08,318 --> 00:14:10,385
"Thank God I don't have to deal 
     with that situation."      

294
00:14:10,454 --> 00:14:11,953
        So how did the guy look?
        Tell me.                

295
00:14:12,022 --> 00:14:13,188
               Does he look cute
               or whatever?     

296
00:14:13,256 --> 00:14:15,490

for Jay.

to get her back,                

299
00:14:18,295 --> 00:14:20,595

302
00:14:25,102 --> 00:14:27,702

310
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,122
This Monte character?           
(grunts) Damn!                  
                            Ugh!

311
00:14:47,191 --> 00:14:49,324
Um, I will say this.            

312
00:14:49,426 --> 00:14:52,227
All the boys you                
brought into the house          
are fine as (bleep).            

313
00:14:52,296 --> 00:14:54,496
And-- yes.                      
              So at least       
              I have good taste.

314
00:14:54,565 --> 00:14:56,765
          What are you here for?
       What are your intentions?

315
00:14:56,834 --> 00:14:58,500
What are my intentions?         
    Are you here to be with her?

316
00:14:58,569 --> 00:15:00,569
■÷  Are ■;  to rekindle that fi?
Hell yeah, man.                 

317
00:15:00,637 --> 00:15:03,205
I'm gonna rekindle the fire.    
What are you talking about?     
              Okay, there we go.

318
00:15:03,273 --> 00:15:05,974
"Oh, I'm gonna be just Mr. Tough
  Guy here to steal your girl.  

319
00:15:06,043 --> 00:15:09,077
 "I'ma flirt with her in front  
  of you and I'm gonna pretend  
         like I'm not.          

320
00:15:09,146 --> 00:15:13,582
      Ha ha! I'm so cool!"      
             Clown.             

321
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,250
    If things don't work out    
           with Jay,            

322
00:15:15,319 --> 00:15:17,486
   are we allowed to take him   
     into our relationship?     

323
00:15:17,554 --> 00:15:18,954
8                               
           (laughter)           

324
00:15:19,022 --> 00:15:21,757
You're allowed to take him      
right now if you want.          
We can share.                   

325
00:15:21,825 --> 00:15:24,993
          (announcer)           
     Oh, God, it's so sweet     
      it's making me sick.      

326
00:15:25,062 --> 00:15:27,062
   Let's see if everyone else   
     can be so levelheaded      

327
00:15:27,131 --> 00:15:31,700
 as Janelle, Farrah, and Nurys  
     return from their stay     
         at the hotel.          

328
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:33,735
Baby, baby, baby!               
Hey!                            

329
00:15:33,804 --> 00:15:35,737
ç■■7■7's Janelle.               
                   Hey!         

330
00:15:35,806 --> 00:15:37,305
Whoo!                           
           What's up?           

331
00:15:37,374 --> 00:15:42,544
      So I've had a night       
      to cool down, relax.      

332
00:15:42,613 --> 00:15:45,881
  Going in the house, for me,   
        it is stressful         

333
00:15:45,949 --> 00:15:47,582
      because I'm dealing       
         with the fact          

334
00:15:47,651 --> 00:15:51,219
    that I really am, like,     
     heartbroken for real.      

335
00:15:51,288 --> 00:15:53,955
  Diandra, can I talk to you?   
Yes.                            

336
00:15:54,024 --> 00:15:56,491
         My main point          
     to pull Diandra aside      

337
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,328
    was to apologize to her     
  and let her know that, hey,   

338
00:15:59,396 --> 00:16:01,163
   I know we've had our beefs   
          in the past.          

339
00:16:01,231 --> 00:16:03,632
   Like, I know we personally   
   don't care for each other,   

340
00:16:03,701 --> 00:16:07,436
  but the attack I made on her  
    was not personal at all.    

341
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:15,544
So basically I just wanted      
to genuinely apologize          
for putting my hands on you.    

342
00:16:15,613 --> 00:16:21,650
Like, my issues are with him.   
Like, I should conduct myself   
better just as a human being.   

343
00:16:21,719 --> 00:16:24,753
You (bleep) kiss her?!          
You're gonna kiss her?!         

344
00:16:24,822 --> 00:16:26,188
                 That is her ex.

345
00:16:26,257 --> 00:16:28,156
          Oh, (bleep).          
  Oh, you ain't tell me that.   

346
00:16:28,225 --> 00:16:29,491
(bleep) you laughing,           
bitch?!                         

347
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,094
   Janelle! Janelle! Janelle!   
You (bleep)hole!                

348
00:16:32,162 --> 00:16:34,796
So I apologize.                 
          I accept your apology.

349
00:16:34,865 --> 00:16:36,732
                Um, I wasn't    
                laughing at you.

350
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,301
       Like, I'm sorry.         
       Like, when I get nervous,
       I'm like...              

351
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:41,570
               (nervous chuckle)
               But I literally--

352
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,972
      all I said, I looked back,
      like, this is crazy.      

353
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:47,376
      And thankful that you came
      to apologize for putting  
      your hands on me.         

354
00:16:47,444 --> 00:16:49,778
No problem.                     
Like, I meant it, but I         
shouldn't be hitting people.    

355
00:16:49,847 --> 00:16:54,650
I saw Janelle go up to Diandra, 
 apologize for the whole thing, 

356
00:16:54,718 --> 00:16:57,286
       argument they had,       
 and just literally broke down. 

357
00:16:57,354 --> 00:17:01,156
       And you know what?       
    It takes a grown person     
to apologize and to admit that. 

358
00:17:01,225 --> 00:17:02,791
          I accept your apology.

359
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:07,930
 With me, if someone says sorry 
  and they genuinely mean it,   

360
00:17:07,932 --> 00:17:09,064
■     I will forgi              

361
00:17:09,133 --> 00:17:11,967
 With me,Will I forget?ys sorry 
  and No. I'm not stupid. it,   

362
00:17:12,036 --> 00:17:13,535
     I will definitely keep     
        my eyes up open,        

363
00:17:13,604 --> 00:17:16,739
 but the minute you say sorry,  
    all right, clean slate.     

364
00:17:18,042 --> 00:17:19,475
I'ma do a handshake.            
                           Okay.

365
00:17:19,543 --> 00:17:20,609
             We'll take it slow.
Yes.                            

366
00:17:20,678 --> 00:17:22,778
Okay. Okay, thank you.          
           All right.           

367
00:17:22,847 --> 00:17:25,581
          (announcer)           
Now that Janelle and Diandra are
       on the same page,        

368
00:17:25,649 --> 00:17:28,550
   the house vibes seem to be   
        in a good place.        

369
00:17:28,619 --> 00:17:32,121
     Maybe Farrah and Nurys     
   can squash their beef too?   

370
00:17:33,691 --> 00:17:35,924
         Hello, house.          

371
00:17:35,993 --> 00:17:36,992
          Hey, Farrah.          

372
00:17:37,061 --> 00:17:38,293
             Hello.             

373
00:17:38,362 --> 00:17:39,662
      There's another one.      

374
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,563
       So I'm back today        
   and I'm going in the house   

375
00:17:41,632 --> 00:17:44,533
   and I'm just staying away    
   from literally everything,   

376
00:17:44,602 --> 00:17:46,969
  everyone, and (bleep) them.   

377
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:48,370
              Aww.              
Have a drink.                   

378
00:17:51,409 --> 00:17:54,543
           I'm back.            
           I'm back.            

379
00:17:54,612 --> 00:17:57,846
          (screaming)           

380
00:17:57,915 --> 00:17:59,915
           (laughter)           

381
00:17:59,984 --> 00:18:02,985
      I'm extremely happy       
   that Nurys came back here.   

382
00:18:03,054 --> 00:18:06,555
     She did nothing wrong,     
   but I understand as to why   
       she had to leave.        

383
00:18:06,624 --> 00:18:09,992
    But I am genuinely upset    
   that Farrah is still here.   

384
00:18:10,061 --> 00:18:13,562
I'm gonna go ahead and leave it 
    in the fate of the Lord     

385
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,865
 and He will take care of that. 
        Karma's a bitch.        

386
00:18:15,933 --> 00:18:18,367
      (indistinct chatter)      

387
00:18:18,436 --> 00:18:21,370
         Good.                  
         So if I started talking
         to another girl,       

388
00:18:21,439 --> 00:18:22,438
        she'd probably find out.
Hey, can we talk?               

389
00:18:22,506 --> 00:18:24,039
        Hi, how are you?        
             Sure.              

390
00:18:24,108 --> 00:18:25,674
In private?                     
             Okay.              

391
00:18:25,743 --> 00:18:27,543
          I don't have          
      to (bleep) apologize      

392
00:18:27,612 --> 00:18:30,145
     because I reacted like     
     a normal human being,      

393
00:18:30,214 --> 00:18:32,114
    but better than a normal    
          human being,          

394
00:18:32,183 --> 00:18:35,117
  'cause a normal human being   
     wouldn't have stopped      
      (bleep) hitting her.      

395
00:18:35,186 --> 00:18:37,353
          (announcer)           
 Actually, a normal human being 

396
00:18:37,421 --> 00:18:39,989
 probably wouldn't kick someone 
         in the vagina.         

397
00:18:40,057 --> 00:18:43,125
          I guess I just wanted 
          to ask where your head
          was at yesterday.     

398
00:18:43,194 --> 00:18:47,263
            'Cause I'm confused 
            as to where all that
            animosity came from.

399
00:18:47,331 --> 00:18:48,831
                All that, like--
Okay, so I'm                    
not confused.                   

400
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,435
I'm very aware about            
what happened yesterday.        

401
00:18:52,503 --> 00:18:54,503
When I come in                  
to just hear what               

402
00:18:54,572 --> 00:18:56,739
my friend's ex-boyfriend        
is saying,                      

403
00:18:56,808 --> 00:19:00,443
all I'm hearing is insults,     
um, from you about me,          

404
00:19:00,511 --> 00:19:02,478
acting like you know me.        
I think--                       

405
00:19:02,547 --> 00:19:05,014
       That all was brought up  
       afterwards, so that's not
       what we're talking about.

406
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:07,983
And continuation of that        
and that was--                  
          No, see, now you're   
          trying to play victim.

407
00:19:08,052 --> 00:19:09,885
            That's not what     
            we're gonna do.     
So I'm not a victim.            

408
00:19:09,954 --> 00:19:12,521
So I know you                   
were just drinking.             
I'm not drinking.               

409
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,957
                     Okay. Okay.
I'm wide awake.                 
I have no patience for that.

       is like Nazarian.        

849
00:40:44,219 --> 00:40:46,119
 It's like my plastic surgeon.  

850
00:40:46,188 --> 00:40:49,055
    I really-- I'd rather be    
      thinking about that       

851
00:40:49,124 --> 00:40:51,257
   than whatever she's about,   
             so...              

852
00:40:52,928 --> 00:40:56,329
             What's up, gangsta?
             What's going on?   
             Talk to me.        

853
00:40:56,398 --> 00:40:58,932
I'm just, like,                 
drained emotionally.            

854
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,935
I just didn't wanna get         
to that point yesterday         
and I did,                      

855
00:41:02,003 --> 00:41:05,638
and now I feel like             
I, like, can't be myself.       

856
00:41:05,707 --> 00:41:07,540
                What do you want
                with us?        

857
00:41:07,609 --> 00:41:09,943
I don't know.                   
You don't trust me anymore.     
It's like--                     

858
00:41:10,011 --> 00:41:12,612
          You honestly believe  
          that I don't trust you
          at all?               

859
00:41:12,681 --> 00:41:15,248
I don't know.                   
                         (sighs)

860
00:41:15,317 --> 00:41:16,683
            I just wish you were
            more honest with me.

861
00:41:16,752 --> 00:41:21,921
       I would prefer the truth.
       Not 10%, 50%, 90%.       

862
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:23,923
               Give me the whole
               damn thing.      

863
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:25,358
Just wanna say sorry.           

864
00:41:25,427 --> 00:41:27,460
I didn't wanna put you          
through all this.               

865
00:41:34,102 --> 00:41:37,570
   Do I still want affection    
   and touch her all the time   

866
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:39,906
      and hug and (bleep)?      
           Hell yeah.           

867
00:41:39,975 --> 00:41:43,176
    So I'll give her a shot.    
 I'll give her a chance again.  

868
00:41:43,245 --> 00:41:47,781
But...                          
I still care about you.         

869
00:41:47,849 --> 00:41:50,450
   It's like, are you happier   
         with me here?          

870
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:52,986
Yeah, what are they gonna do?   
Send me a new blond?            

871
00:41:55,224 --> 00:41:57,357
          (announcer)           
   We know where Jay stands,    

872
00:41:57,426 --> 00:42:00,627
    but the rest of the exes    
are still making up their minds.

873
00:42:00,696 --> 00:42:03,296
       I just wanna know where--
       what-- like, where your  
       heads are at             

874
00:42:03,365 --> 00:42:05,332
             and why you would--
             you know, like,    

875
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,400
     who you guys wanna vote out
     and, like, why?            

876
00:42:07,469 --> 00:42:10,303
           (Diandra)            
The only singles on the chopping
  block are Corey and Farrah.   

877
00:42:10,372 --> 00:42:12,706
      Corey because Morgan      
         wants him out.         

878
00:42:12,774 --> 00:42:17,310
 She doesn't feel that she can  
   continue her relationship    
   ay while he's here.          

879
00:42:17,379 --> 00:42:19,279
         And Farrah is          
     on the chopping block.     

880
00:42:19,348 --> 00:42:23,350
 It's 'cause she kicked my girl 
  in the vagina and she needs   
        to (bleep) off.         

881
00:42:23,418 --> 00:42:25,185
         Morgan's like,         
   "Someone help me, please."   

882
00:42:25,254 --> 00:42:27,320
    But she's not actually      
    physically getting attacked,
    and it's bull(bleep).       

883
00:42:27,389 --> 00:42:29,289
    You know I get your side,   
    and I feel so bad for Morgan

884
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:32,292
   that she's gotten bull(bleep)
   after bull(bleep)            
   after bull(bleep).           

885
00:42:32,361 --> 00:42:34,895
       But to be honest,        
       she did not get          
       this physically attacked.

886
00:42:34,963 --> 00:42:37,431
   That's so (bleep) up that any
   of you guys are even deciding

887
00:42:37,499 --> 00:42:40,333
          for even the slightest
          (bleep) bit.          
          Seriously?            

888
00:42:40,402 --> 00:42:42,202
 I don't understand why people  
      wanna get Corey out.      

889
00:42:42,271 --> 00:42:45,439
  Corey hasn't done anything.   
       Faa crazy,               
       delusional bitch.        

890
00:42:45,507 --> 00:42:47,307
■#■#     She's the one          
      that's the problem.       

891
00:42:47,376 --> 00:42:50,010
         It's the craziest thing
          you guy               

892
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:52,646
     We're supposed to be exes  
     and we're supposed         
     to stick together, correct?

893
00:42:52,715 --> 00:42:54,614
        Correct, and none       
        of you guys had my back.

894
00:42:54,683 --> 00:42:56,249
               It's the biggest 
               bull(bleep) ever.

895
00:42:56,318 --> 00:42:57,417
Even though I know              
she hurt you,                   

896
00:42:57,486 --> 00:42:59,553
and, like, Farrah did           
do things wrong,                

897
00:42:59,621 --> 00:43:01,321
everyone's done                 
a couple things wrong,          
and at this point, like,        

898
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:02,889
it's like we're not all         
gonna come to one.              

899
00:43:02,958 --> 00:43:05,826
I think we should all just vote 
what we think at this point.    

900
00:43:05,894 --> 00:43:08,228
   So I'm just gonna go ahead   
 and crush Farrah just because  

901
00:43:08,297 --> 00:43:11,098
      I feel like Farrah,       
  if you're gonna respect her,  
 she'll respectight back.       

902
00:43:11,166 --> 00:43:15,302
She treats all of us pretty good
     other than the people      
     that she doesn't like,     

903
00:43:15,371 --> 00:43:17,104
       which is everyone        
       for the most part.       

904
00:43:17,172 --> 00:43:18,605
   I shouldn't have to (bleep)--
   this should be easy.         

905
00:43:18,674 --> 00:43:20,340
             It shouldn't       
             even be a question.

906
00:43:20,409 --> 00:43:22,376
I totally understand why        
you want her out.               

907
00:43:22,444 --> 00:43:23,710
I wish y'all would just         
talk it out.                    

908
00:43:23,779 --> 00:43:26,179
But you don't even              
wanna talk to me, so...         

909
00:43:26,248 --> 00:43:27,914
     I thought she did try      
        to talk to her.         

910
00:43:27,983 --> 00:43:29,816
     She did try                
     to talk to Farrah,         
     and Farrah just blew--     

911
00:43:29,885 --> 00:43:31,685
          I already know        
          I'm the bigger person.
          I don't need to.      

912
00:43:31,754 --> 00:43:33,387
             I'm not going up   
             to the bitch again.

913
00:43:33,455 --> 00:43:35,255
           And yes, I will      
           call her a bitch     
           'cause she's a bitch.

914
00:43:35,324 --> 00:43:37,991
      Like, I really don't care.

915
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:41,028
            (Nurys)             
  It sucks to see that people   
      don't have my back.       

916
00:43:41,096 --> 00:43:43,864
    I haven't done anything     
        to deserve that.
