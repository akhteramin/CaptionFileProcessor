              Five!             
         - That's Lani.         

347
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:55,687
         Open the case.         
           - Low, low.          

348
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:58,022
            Oh, low.            
            - Oh, no.           

349
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:01,492
   - Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!   
    - She fooled you. Oh, my.   

350
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:03,494
        - One more case.        

351
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:06,397
       - Okay, number ten!      

352
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:08,466
     - Number ten is Vaeda.     

353
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:09,968
         Open your case.        

354
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,136
    - Please, please, please,   
             please.            

355
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:13,237
              Yay!              

356
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,174
         Yay, yay, yay!         

357
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:19,777
             - Whoa!            
             - Whoo!            

358
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:21,346
     - Was that a cartwheel?    
     - That was a cartwheel.    

359
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:22,447
             - Wow!             

360
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:24,048
        - I'm so excited        
      I'm doing cartwheels.     

361
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,951
         - Oh, my. Wow.         

362
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:29,821
         You got a penny        
     and stuck the landing.     

363
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:31,589
    I think that's wonderful.   

364
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:34,892
           All right,           
    here's your arch nemesis.   

365
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:36,127
         [crowd jeering]        

366
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:37,795
            - Oh, no.           

367
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,566
       - She says one word      
          comes to mind         

368
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,935
     when she looks at you,     
       and that is spunky.      

369
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:46,137
           [laughter]           

370
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:48,172
         - Spunky, baby.        

371
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:50,541
           [applause]           

372
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:52,010
            - Oh, oh.           

373
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:55,713
          She's saying          
    she does not like spunky.   

374
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:57,882
        [crowd murmuring]       

375
00:16:57,984 --> 00:17:00,251
        - Well, she needs       
         to lighten up.         

376
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,453
           [laughter]           

377
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:04,022
             - Okay.            

378
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:06,624
  You knocked out the million,  

379
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:11,829
  so she's dropping this offer  
           to $10,000.          

380
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:15,099
          Listen to me.         
   $10,000 is a lot of money.   

381
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,934
        You've been here        
    for a couple of minutes,    

382
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:18,803
    you know, boom, $10,000.    

383
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:20,738
 Nobody gets that kind of money.

384
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,541
  You also have an opportunity  
        to counter-offer.       

385
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:26,077
      If it's a reasonable      
 counteroffer, she may take it, 

386
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:28,279
       you sell your case,      
        and you go home,        

387
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:31,716
     or you can continue on     
 and open up another four cases.

388
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:33,017
    These are big decisions,    

389
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,353
 but you brought people you know
            with you.           

390
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:37,121
   Let's meet your supporters.  

391
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,991
             - Okay.            

392
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:42,260
              - Hi.             
              - Hi.             

393
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:44,028
         - Who are you?         
           - I'm Jill.          

394
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,531
     I've been best friends     
   with Missy my entire life.   

395
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:48,066
  We went to elementary school  
            together.           

396
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:50,001
    We went to middle school    
     together, high school,     

397
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:51,969
    college, we got married.    

398
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:54,072
      Not together, but...      
            [laughs]            

399
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:55,406
     - She's my best friend.    

400
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:57,642
   - She was the first person   
    there when my water broke   

401
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,677
    when I was having a baby,   

402
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:02,480
        and she is lucky,       
      and she is gonna win.     

403
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,315
             - Wow.             

404
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:05,750
            You are?            
            - Renee.            

405
00:18:05,852 --> 00:18:07,085
          - Hi, Renee.          
              - Hi.             

406
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:09,287
  Missy and I have been friends 
        forever as well.        

407
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:12,690
       I love her energy.       
       She is a caregiver.      

408
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:14,759
   Her father lost his sight,   

409
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:16,994
    and she is there for him    
           every day.           

410
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:20,765
  There's no one more deserving 
    than her family and her.    

411
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:22,266
        - That's so nice.       
          And you are?          

412
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:24,569
      - Hi, I'm Jill also.      

413
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:25,570
     I've been best friends     
          with Marissa          

414
00:18:25,672 --> 00:18:27,205
   since I was five years old,  

415
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:30,408
  and one thing Marissa didn't  
 tell you, she is an only child.

416
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:33,244
       She has taken care       
 of her parents her entire life.

417
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:35,246
         She is giving.         
          She is kind.          

418
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:37,381
         No one deserves        
        this opportunity        

419
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:39,083
    more than my best friend,   
             no one.            

420
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:40,184
      [cheers and applause]     

421
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,987
         - I love them.         
      - And they love you.      

422
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:44,989
 Is this your family right here?
             - Yes.             

423
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:46,157
  - Are you proud of your mom?  
             - Yeah.            

424
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:48,693
       - Yeah, extremely.       
        - Yeah, they are.       

425
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:49,694
  So everybody's proud of you.  

426
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,562
 Everybody speaks highly of you,

427
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:54,899
  but they've got an important  
   decision to make right now.  

428
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:56,901
    Talk amongst yourselves.    
     What do you want to do?    

429
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:59,537
   - Okay. What should we do?   
      - Look at the board.      

430
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:00,638
     You're not ready to go.    

431
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,806
           - Yeah, no.          
    Some really big numbers.    

432
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:03,374
  - We're gonna play the game.  
           - No deal.           

433
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,309
       - No deal, no deal.      

434
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:07,612
       - It's still a lot       
        of money, Howie.        

435
00:19:07,714 --> 00:19:10,181
   - It is a lot of money, but  
 I'm gonna ask you the question.

436
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:12,850
        Missy Silverman,        
        deal or no deal?        

437
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:14,452
          - Oh, Howie.          

438
00:19:14,554 --> 00:19:16,554
        [crowd shouting]        

439
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:17,955
         - Just play it.        

440
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:20,124
             - Okay.            

441
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:21,926
            No deal!            

442
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:25,129
        No deal, no deal!       

443
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:26,464
  - You got four cases to open. 

444
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:29,333
      You could still find      
  that special prize in there.  

445
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:32,570
        Let's keep going.       
              - 16!             

446
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,739
               16.              
      - 16 is Jessica Lee.      

447
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,274
  - I hope it's low, low, low.  

448
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:38,509
 - Jessica Lee, open your case. 

449
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:42,980
             - Ooh.             
              - Oh!             

450
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:45,416
   - That was the worst case.   
         - Oh, my Lord.         

451
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:51,956
  - But you still got a block,  
     $300,000 and $400,000.     

452
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:55,193
       Either one of those      
      is the dream, right?      

453
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:56,761
           - Oh, yeah.          
             - Okay.            

454
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,329
        Three more cases.       

455
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:01,766
          - Number one!         

456
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,601
           Number one.          
            - Soraya.           

457
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:08,072
      Soraya, she's asking      
 for a low amount or a vacation.

458
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:10,141
 - Low amount. She's not asking 
      me to do a cartwheel,     

459
00:20:10,243 --> 00:20:12,510
    because I can't do that,    
  but a low amount I could do.

            $32,000.            

578
00:26:35,695 --> 00:26:36,961
     - Huge amount of money.    

579
00:26:37,063 --> 00:26:40,064
   - Years ago, we had a fire   
     at our family car wash.    

580
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:42,232
  Our business had burned down. 
              - Aw.             

581
00:26:42,335 --> 00:26:44,201
    - To the ground. My gosh.   

582
00:26:44,303 --> 00:26:49,974
 And that money really can help,

583
00:26:50,076 --> 00:26:53,444
   but there's still $400,000   
          on the board          

584
00:26:53,546 --> 00:26:57,081
   and $300,000 on the board,   
       and I'm a fighter.       

585
00:26:57,183 --> 00:27:01,819
         I am a fighter.        
 I think I might keep fighting. 

586
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:04,121
          - Absolutely!         

587
00:27:04,223 --> 00:27:05,122
           Absolutely!          

588
00:27:05,224 --> 00:27:06,156
          - Keep going.         

589
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:07,191
    - Your daughter's talking   
             to you.            

590
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:08,258
      What are you saying?      

591
00:27:08,361 --> 00:27:09,360
      - I think she should      
           keep going.          

592
00:27:09,462 --> 00:27:10,394
     - You think she should     
           keep going.          

593
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:11,729
   You don't think she should   
            counter,            

594
00:27:11,831 --> 00:27:13,130
        you don't think--       
       - No, I don't--no.       

595
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:14,298
    - Is your mom a fighter?    

596
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,733
  Do you think she's a fighter? 
             - Yeah.            

597
00:27:15,835 --> 00:27:18,102
    - A fighter and a winner.   
   - "A fighter and a winner,"  

598
00:27:18,204 --> 00:27:19,903
       your husband said.       

599
00:27:20,006 --> 00:27:22,706
    - Keep going, keep going.   
          - Keep going.         

600
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,642
       - You have a goal,       
        you have a goal.        

601
00:27:24,744 --> 00:27:26,810
        - She has a goal?       
  - And it's not your business. 

602
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:28,646
   - Oh, it's not my business.  

603
00:27:28,748 --> 00:27:30,447
         Oh, so you have        
       an amount in mind?       

604
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:34,051
        - No, no, no, no,       
     not an amount, a goal.     

605
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:35,586
        - I have a goal.        
         We have a goal.        

606
00:27:35,688 --> 00:27:38,922
 - Can we know what the goal is?
  - Yeah, to get the $400,000.  

607
00:27:39,025 --> 00:27:41,325
            Yes! Yes!           

608
00:27:41,427 --> 00:27:43,060
             - Okay.            
       - That's the goal.       

609
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:45,429
             - Yes!             

610
00:27:45,531 --> 00:27:48,666
       - Missy Silverman,       

611
00:27:48,768 --> 00:27:50,934
        deal or no deal?        

612
00:27:51,037 --> 00:27:52,403
        [crowd shouting]        

613
00:27:52,505 --> 00:27:54,438
            - No way!           
              - No.             

614
00:27:58,244 --> 00:28:00,744
        - No deal, Howie!       

615
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:04,548
            No deal.            
             - Wow.             

616
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:08,352
            Stay away           
      from those two cases.     

617
00:28:08,454 --> 00:28:12,556
       - Okay, number 26!       

618
00:28:12,658 --> 00:28:14,558
   - Michelle, open the case.   

619
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,827
       - Low, low, please,      
         please, please.        

620
00:28:18,597 --> 00:28:21,832
      - You got the prize,      
       you got the prize!       

621
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:23,701
          - [cheering]          

622
00:28:23,803 --> 00:28:25,769
        We're going away!       
        We're going away!       

623
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,306
      - By opening the case     

624
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:32,242
         that's holding         
   the Princess Cruises logo,   

625
00:28:32,344 --> 00:28:34,344
      you have won a cruise     

626
00:28:34,447 --> 00:28:39,349
   to one of Princess Cruises'  
        380 destinations        

627
00:28:39,452 --> 00:28:41,952
            that span           
     over seven continents.     

628
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:44,521
  They are known to be the best 
   global premium cruise line.  

629
00:28:44,623 --> 00:28:48,358
    Missy, discover the world   
        and relax at sea.       

630
00:28:48,461 --> 00:28:49,860
        Congratulations.        

631
00:28:49,962 --> 00:28:51,395
       You can go anywhere      
         with the girls.        

632
00:28:51,497 --> 00:28:52,696
    You got the girls' trip.    

633
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:54,331
   - We're going on a cruise!   

634
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:58,135
      [cheers and applause]     

635
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:01,105
   Oh, my gosh. I'm so happy!   

636
00:29:01,207 --> 00:29:02,439
        - Two more cases.       

637
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:05,442
          - Okay, two.          

638
00:29:05,544 --> 00:29:07,044
            - Taylor.           
       - A little amount.       

639
00:29:07,146 --> 00:29:09,646
    - Taylor, open your case.   
          - Oh, please.         

640
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:13,117
   - Small amount, left side.   
 - Little, left side, left side.

641
00:29:13,219 --> 00:29:15,552
        Yay! That's good.       

642
00:29:15,654 --> 00:29:17,187
        Oh, that's good.        

643
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:18,589
         - That's great.        
          - Thank you.          

644
00:29:18,691 --> 00:29:20,257
    - That's great, one more.   
          - Thank you.          

645
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:23,894
               15!              
       - 15, that's Madi.       

646
00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:25,963
      Madi, open your case.     

647
00:29:26,065 --> 00:29:27,364
       - Oh, I can't look.      

648
00:29:27,466 --> 00:29:29,333
          I'm nervous.          
           - So am I.           

649
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:32,336
      - Low, low, low, low.     

650
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:36,206
       Yes, yes, yes, yes!      

651
00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:37,307
        I'm freaking out.       

652
00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:38,642
     - That's a great board.    
           - Oh, yay.           

653
00:29:38,744 --> 00:29:39,643
       - You think you're       
          freaking out?         

654
00:29:39,745 --> 00:29:40,978
   I think she's freaking out.  

655
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,714
     That's because the game    
     is going great for you,    

656
00:29:43,816 --> 00:29:45,149
      not so great for her.     

657
00:29:47,153 --> 00:29:48,619
            - Hello?            

658
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,389
             Hello?             

659
00:29:52,491 --> 00:29:54,258
          - [whistles]          
        Wake up, banker!        

660
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,526
          - Whoa, whoa.         

661
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:56,760
     - Did she just do that?    

662
00:29:56,862 --> 00:29:58,862
      - That was--hang on.      
        - Let's go, girl!       

663
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:00,831
        - What was that?        
         You scared me.         

664
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:02,332
         You scared me.         

665
00:30:02,434 --> 00:30:04,201
    I didn't know what that--   

666
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:05,803
    did that come out of you?   

667
00:30:05,905 --> 00:30:08,138
           [laughter]           

668
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,507
       How do you do that?      
           - Oh, boy.           

669
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:16,180
          Oh, my gosh.          
          Oh, my gosh.          

670
00:30:16,282 --> 00:30:18,849
            - Right.            

671
00:30:18,951 --> 00:30:20,984
        Okay. All right.        

672
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:25,722
 Okay, there's eight cases left 
   that have not been opened.   

673
00:30:25,825 --> 00:30:27,224
 Two of them have huge amounts, 

674
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:30,460
      which means you have      
          a 25% chance          

675
00:30:30,563 --> 00:30:34,364
     of walking out of here     
     with at least $300,000.    

676
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:37,367
      [cheers and applause]     

677
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:39,303
             You do,            
   if you continue to play on,  

678
00:30:39,405 --> 00:30:41,071
   have to open up two cases,   

679
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:43,440
  so it's a little precarious,  
    but you're in good shape.   

680
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:46,844
         She understands        
   that you're in good shape.   

681
00:30:46,946 --> 00:30:49,713
    She knows the board, and    
  that's why this next offer--  

682
00:30:49,815 --> 00:30:50,814
            - Uh-huh.           

683
00:30:50,916 --> 00:30:52,883
           - "Uh-huh."          
        - In good shape.        

684
00:30:52,985 --> 00:30:57,087
           - $53,000,           

685
00:30:57,189 --> 00:31:01,291
       and you still have       
 an opportunity to counteroffer.

686
00:31:01,393 --> 00:31:03,493
            - No, no.           
   - There's so much going on.  

687
00:31:03,596 --> 00:31:05,229
        - No. No, no, no,       
    look at the board, okay?    

688
00:31:05,331 --> 00:31:06,296
         You had a goal.        

689
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:08,265
       You're in a really       
         good position,         

690
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:11,134
         and that number        
       is not high enough.      

691
00:31:11,237 --> 00:31:13,237
  - It's a high number, though. 
        - Don't take it.        

692

00:37:59,378 --> 00:38:03,513

       what she has to do.      

807
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:05,382

809
00:38:07,252 --> 00:38:09,452

      when you think back,      

810
00:38:09,554 --> 00:38:12,289
      to turn down $53,000?     

811
00:38:12,391 --> 00:38:15,692
    - It was very, very hard    
      to turn down $53,000.     

812
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:16,926
       - It was very hard.

813
00:38:17,029 --> 00:38:20,330
     - So if that was hard,     
    what are you gonna do...    

814
00:38:20,432 --> 00:38:23,300
            - Oh, no.           

815
00:38:23,402 --> 00:38:26,670
         - With $77,000?        

816
00:38:26,772 --> 00:38:28,171
              - Oh!             

817
00:38:28,273 --> 00:38:29,906
              - No.             

818
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:31,341
      - Look at her board.      
             - Yeah.            

819
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:32,776
      - Look at that board.     
    - That's a pretty board.    

820
00:38:32,878 --> 00:38:34,778
  - And now, she only does one  
           at a time.           

821
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,112
            - Right.            
        - One at a time!        

822
00:38:36,214 --> 00:38:37,414
      - It's not even time      
      for the counteroffer.     

823
00:38:37,516 --> 00:38:38,615
     - Mom, then you can do     
    a counteroffer for the--    

824
00:38:38,717 --> 00:38:40,183
       - What do you say?       

825
00:38:40,285 --> 00:38:43,186
  - I'm saying she should wait  
  to counter-offer until, like, 

826
00:38:43,288 --> 00:38:44,721
          if she knocks         
     one of the bigger ones.    

827
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:46,289
             - Yeah.            
    - She still can lose one.   

828
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:47,957
    She can still lose one of   
  the $300,000 or the $400,000. 

829
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,225
    - He doesn't always agree   
     with her, so he agreed.    

830
00:38:49,328 --> 00:38:50,960
    - This is the first time    
        they have agreed?       

831
00:38:51,063 --> 00:38:52,362
         - It might be.         

832
00:38:52,464 --> 00:38:54,331
     The force is with you.     
         I'd keep going.        

833
00:38:54,433 --> 00:38:56,466
       - But you realize,       
        if she knocks out       

834
00:38:56,568 --> 00:38:57,901
 and loses one of those amounts,

835
00:38:58,003 --> 00:39:00,170
       either the $300,000      
        or the $400,000,        

836
00:39:00,272 --> 00:39:01,271
     there's no safety net.

       the counter until--

1073
00:49:45,917 --> 00:49:47,116

  I'm not really good at math.  

1076
00:49:55,093 --> 00:49:57,760

        deal or no deal?        

1077
00:49:57,862 --> 00:50:00,696

   make a counteroffer, Howie.  

1078
00:50:00,798 --> 00:50:03,733
       - Okay, counter up.      
       And the offer is...      

1079

1083
00:50:16,781 --> 00:50:21,984

   going to take the $95,000,   

1084
00:50:22,086 --> 00:50:25,287
 or are you going to have to go 
   on and open one more case,   

1085
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:27,923
      and if that happens,      
         is the $400,000

    because if she takes it,    

1154
00:54:26,797 --> 00:54:31,100
      you walk out of here      
          with $95,000          

1155
00:54:31,202 --> 00:54:33,269
  and a beautiful girls' trip.  

1156
00:54:33,371 --> 00:54:35,537
       You have the cruise      
     with Princess Cruises,     

1157
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:38,240
    so you already have that,   
       so it's a win-win.       

1158
00:54:38,342 --> 00:54:42,011
       But if she says no       
  and doesn't take your offer,  

1159
00:54:42,113 --> 00:54:44,280
 the $95,000 comes off the table

1160
00:54:44,382 --> 00:54:46,348
      and you have to open      
          another case.         

1161
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:50,586
 If that one more case you open 
        is the $400,000,        

1162
00:54:50,688 --> 00:54:53,422
   the most you can leave with  
           is $50,000,          

1163
00:54:53,524 --> 00:54:56,392
        so it's a really        
        precarious time.        

1164
00:54:56,494 --> 00:54:58,761
         [phone ringing]        
         This is scary.         

1165
00:54:58,863 --> 00:55:00,729
          - I'm scared.         
      - I'm scared for you.     

1166
00:55:00,831 --> 00:55:01,997
          - Thank you.          
        - You're welcome.       

1167
00:55:02,099 --> 00:55:04,400
           [laughter]           

1168
00:55:04,502 --> 00:55:06,969
            - [sighs]           

1169
00:55:07,071 --> 00:55:08,070
     That's a lot of money.     

1170
00:55:11,609 --> 00:55:15,244
         - Right. Okay.         

1171
00:55:15,346 --> 00:55:17,746
           All right.           

1172
00:55:17,848 --> 00:55:19,882
      - Oh, what'd she say?     

1173
00:55:19,984 --> 00:55:21,984
           - She said           
    she's giving you a gift.    

1174
00:55:23,421 --> 00:55:25,387
       - Oh, that's nice.       

1175
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:28,691
    She said that you've been   
        saying all game,        

1176
00:55:28,793 --> 00:55:29,992
      how lucky you are...      

1177
00:55:30,094 --> 00:55:31,927
           - Oh, God.           

1178
00:55:32,029 --> 00:55:34,830
    - And her gift to you...    

1179
00:55:34,932 --> 00:55:37,032
 is the opportunity to prove it.

1180
00:55:37,134 --> 00:55:38,467
         It is no deal.         

1181
00:55:38,569 --> 00:55:41,070
          - Oh, my God!         

1182
00:55:41,172 --> 00:55:42,338
              - No!             

1183
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,673
              - Oh!             
           - Play on.           

1184
00:55:44,775 --> 00:55:46,275
      - I'm good with that.     

1185
00:55:46,377 --> 00:55:49,011
   - You got this, you got it.  
 75% chance you're gonna win it.

1186
00:55:49,113 --> 00:55:51,613
       - All right, Miss.       
       - Oh, I don't know.      

1187
00:55:51,716 --> 00:55:52,815
       - We were even just      
       second-guessing it,      

1188
00:55:52,917 --> 00:55:53,816
         so that's good.        

1189
00:55:53,918 --> 00:55:56,018
   - What case should I open?   

1190
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:58,253
        [crowd shouting]        

1191
00:55:58,356 --> 00:56:00,823
        - I can tell you        
     what case not to open.     

1192
00:56:00,925 --> 00:56:02,825
 Do not open the $400,000 case. 

1193
00:56:02,927 --> 00:56:04,159
          - Oh, I hope          
      that doesn't happen.      

1194
00:56:04,261 --> 00:56:06,095
     - That is the landmine.    

1195
00:56:06,197 --> 00:56:09,431
  - Oh, gosh, all these numbers 
        mean stuff to me.       

1196
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:11,700
        Oh, it's so hard.       

1197
00:56:11,802 --> 00:56:14,069
        8 is my birthday.       

1198
00:56:14,171 --> 00:56:15,437
            - Right.            

1199
00:56:18,442 --> 00:56:22,578
   - 13 is my son's birthday.   

1200
00:56:24,281 --> 00:56:27,516
           And then 7           
      is my dad's birthday.     

1201
00:56:27,618 --> 00:56:29,685
          Oh, my gosh,          
    I don't know what to do.    

1202
00:56:29,787 --> 00:56:30,886
  Okay, I'm gonna just say it.  

1203
00:56:30,988 --> 00:56:32,588
            - Say it.           
      - It's coming to me.      

1204
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:35,491
 I'm praying it's a low number. 

1205
00:56:35,593 --> 00:56:39,661
          Number 7! Oh!         

1206
00:56:39,764 --> 00:56:41,463
          - Oh, my God.         
   - That's what I would pick.  

1207
00:56:41,565 --> 00:56:43,065
    I would have picked that.   

1208
00:56:43,167 --> 00:56:45,834
       - We're gonna pray,      
 we're gonna pray. I'm praying. 

1209
00:56:45,936 --> 00:56:49,505
         - This one case        
   can make you or break you.   

1210
00:56:49,607 --> 00:56:51,473
     - I hope it's make me.

     anything but $400,000.     

1213
00:56:58,315 --> 00:57:00,649
           - So scary.          
        - Open the case.        

1214
00:57:01,852 --> 00:57:04,119
       - I'm not looking.       

1215
00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:08,490
          Please, low.

1218
00:57:12,997 --> 00:57:14,029
          That's good.          

1219
00:57:14,131 --> 00:57:15,264
         - That's great.        
         - That's good.

00:57:22,406 --> 00:57:24,606
          That's good.          
       That's pretty good.

  So you got three cases left.

           One of them          
      is holding $400,000.      

1227
00:57:32,883 --> 00:57:34,082
   You believe it's this one?   

1228
00:57:34,185 --> 00:57:37,085
         - I don't know.        
          It could be.

         Hello, models.

00:57:59,777 --> 00:58:01,910
        Please, shaking.        

1239
00:58:02,012 --> 00:58:03,946

           your luck.           

1240
00:58:04,048 --> 00:58:05,848

1243
00:58:13,023 --> 00:58:14,389
     - You say it paid off.     
             - Yeah.            

1244
00:58:14,492 --> 00:58:16,124
  - They're saying it paid off. 
    Do you think it paid off?   

1245
00:58:16,227 --> 00:58:18,160
           - I don't--          
      I hope so, I hope so.     

1246
00:58:18,262 --> 00:58:21,663
         Oh, I hope so.         
       I hope it paid off.      

1247

1248
00:58:23,634 --> 00:58:26,301
   - You would have walked out  
  of here with $95,000, right?  

1249
00:58:26,403 --> 00:58:28,170
          - If she took         
       that counter, yes.       

1250
00:58:28,272 --> 00:58:30,606
             - Yeah.            
          - She didn't.         

1251
00:58:30,708 --> 00:58:36,245
    - Would you walk out now    
          for $165,000?

1280
00:59:49,587 --> 00:59:51,019

1281
00:59:51,121 --> 00:59:52,888
   and you went one more time,  

1282
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:55,290
     the next case you would    
 have opened would have been... 

1283
00:59:55,392 --> 00:59:58,293
            - Eight.            
  - Okay, Neka, open your case.

       at the right time.
