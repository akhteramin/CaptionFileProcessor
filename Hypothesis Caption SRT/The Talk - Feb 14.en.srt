So there you are with           
your depression                 

780
00:27:57,239 --> 00:28:01,041
and your dirty laundry that you 
just don't want to deal with.   

781
00:28:01,077 --> 00:28:04,778
Because depression is           
multiple symptoms.              

782
00:28:04,797 --> 00:28:07,798
Yeah, time for a change.        

783
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:10,250
And your doctor tells you       
about TRINTELLIX,

      or just to sleep in.      

1281
00:47:11,807 --> 00:47:14,791
  Strong chemo can put you at   
   risk of serious infection.   

1282
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:17,127
    In a key study Neulasta     
 reduced the risk of infection  

1283
00:47:17,146 --> 00:47:19,730
        from 17% to 1%,

      the day after chemo       

1287
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:26,854
  and is used by most patients  
             today.             

1288
00:47:26,906 --> 00:47:28,572

        cancer patients         

1289

 receiving strong chemotherapy. 

1290
00:47:30,609 --> 00:47:32,576
 Do not take Neulasta if you're 
         allergic to it         

1291
00:47:32,611 --> 00:47:34,027
   or Neupogen (filgrastim).    

1292
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,530
    An incomplete dose could    
    increase infection risk.
