DESTROYED THE VALUE ALSO.

780
00:32:33,347 --> 00:32:35,614

AND SO I ASKED HOW MANY EHOUSES 

781
00:32:35,616 --> 00:32:38,083
AND SO I ASKED HOW MANY EHOUSES 
DO WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH AND

THE MORE I REALIZED LIFTING THE 
VEIL OF MISTRUST BETWEEN

INCLUDING MORE MINORITY RECRUITS

   Oh I love it. It's a great   
   razor.                       

1103
00:44:44,315 --> 00:44:46,482

   middle.
