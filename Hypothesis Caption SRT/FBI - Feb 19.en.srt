00:06:11,655 --> 00:06:13,021
         - Not when you         
       threaten his life.       

121
00:06:13,107 --> 00:06:14,689
   - What about my life, huh?   

122
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:17,159
     Look what he did to me     
    with that article of his.   

123
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:19,277
     I lost my job, my wife,    

124
00:06:19,329 --> 00:06:21,913
   my reputation, my freedom.   

125
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:24,616
       <i> I lost everything,</i>      
        <i> because of him.</i>        

126
00:06:24,668 --> 00:06:25,951
            <i> - Yeah.</i>            

127
00:06:26,036 --> 00:06:27,669
        <i> Did he make you</i>        
     <i> take those bribes too?</i>    

128
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:29,754
        <i> - It's not like</i>        
      <i> I was the only one.</i>      

129
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,707
            <i> - Right.</i>           
     <i> This is all his fault</i>     

130
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:35,794
   which is why you drove down  
     to the New York Ledger.    

131
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:37,796
        Give him a piece        
      of your mind, right?      

132
00:06:37,848 --> 00:06:40,799
   But when that didn't work,   

133
00:06:40,851 --> 00:06:42,434
 you took it to the next level. 

134
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:44,136
    - Not sure what you mean.   

135
00:06:44,221 --> 00:06:47,305
        - Rob McCann was        
      murdered last night.      

136
00:06:49,226 --> 00:06:51,526
          - He's dead?          

137
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:52,978
  - You have his home address.  

138
00:06:53,063 --> 00:06:54,696
     You were stalking him.     

139
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,231
  - No. I mean I wouldn't say-- 
    - And then you caught up    

140
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:57,566
      with him in the park,     
        and you shot him.       

141
00:06:57,651 --> 00:07:00,035
           - What? No.          
        No, it wasn't me.       

142
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,070
         I swear to you         
       I did not kill him.      

143
00:07:02,156 --> 00:07:04,489
   - He was a great reporter.   

144
00:07:04,575 --> 00:07:06,541
        <i> Happily married.</i>       

145
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:08,160
      He had his whole life     
          ahead of him,         

146
00:07:08,212 --> 00:07:12,130
            and then            
        just like that...       

147
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:15,083
         snatched away.         

148
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:17,669
     - What has she told you    
          about Jason?          

149
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:21,506
    - That he was a reporter    
    who died in a car crash.    

150
00:07:21,558 --> 00:07:24,676
 - That's why this case strikes 
      such a chord in her.      

151
00:07:24,761 --> 00:07:27,729
 Why she identifies so strongly 
        with the victim.        

152
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:30,682
      - It won't affect her     
 objectivity as an investigator.

153
00:07:30,767 --> 00:07:32,234
 - Well, I trust you'll keep me 
          in the loop,          

154
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,320
    if you see that changing.   

155
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:43,745
   - This puts you in the area  
      when Rob McCann died,     

156
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,330
        so explain that.        

157
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:46,865
             - Okay.            

158
00:07:46,917 --> 00:07:49,868
    I saw McCann catch a cab,   
       and I followed him,      

159
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,037
      but I ran a red light     
       trying to keep up.       

160
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:54,172
  That's how I got the ticket.  

161
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,957
   After that, I drove around   
        looking for him.        

162
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:57,959
   I was about to give up when  
  I saw him walk into the park. 

163
00:07:58,045 --> 00:07:59,511
        - And you walked        
       in right after him.      

164
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:00,712
              - No.             

165
00:08:00,797 --> 00:08:02,380
         I drove around         
      to Central Park West      

166
00:08:02,432 --> 00:08:04,432
       and waited for him       
   to come out the other side.  

167
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:07,219
  I just wanted to talk to him, 
           all right?           

168
00:08:07,271 --> 00:08:09,104
      But he never showed.      
             - Okay.            

169
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:10,639
     Then give me a witness     
      that saw you sitting      

170
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:12,274
          in your car,          
      in Central Park West.     

171
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:15,944
           - I can't.           
      There was no witness.     

172
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,063
     - First degree murder.     
         Lying in wait.         

173
00:08:18,148 --> 00:08:20,699
      Do you have any idea      
 what's about to happen to you? 

174
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:21,900
             - Wait.            
              Wait.             

175
00:08:21,952 --> 00:08:24,769
       There was somebody.      
             - Who?             

176
00:08:24,821 --> 00:08:27,906
           - A jogger.          
    He came out of the park,    

177
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:30,792
          off the path          
  that I figured McCann was on. 

178
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:34,462
        - When was that?        
  - A little after 10:30 maybe. 

179
00:08:34,548 --> 00:08:35,830
    - What did he look like?    
        - Like a jogger.        

180
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,216
          I don't know.         
    He was wearing a hoodie.    

181
00:08:38,252 --> 00:08:40,835
          - What color?         

182
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:43,088
          - Dark blue.          

183
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,092
     - There's your jogger.     

184
00:08:47,177 --> 00:08:48,810
        No CCTV footage,        
        but I did manage        

185
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,645
      to find a restaurant      
      with security cameras     

186
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:53,265
    pointed towards the right   
  stretch of Central Park West. 

187
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,767
    The blue fiber came back    
     as a cotton-poly blend     

188
00:08:55,819 --> 00:08:58,770
    which is consistent with    
  the sweatshirt he's wearing,  

189
00:08:58,822 --> 00:09:02,574
       and there's Santos,      
      from 10:25 to 10:42.      

190
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:04,442
     He never left his car.     

191
00:09:04,494 --> 00:09:05,860
     - Which alibis him out.    

192
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:07,495
    - I'm starting to wonder.   

193
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:09,864
     I mean you would expect    
       a murder like this       

194
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,616
     to be more rage-filled.    

195
00:09:11,702 --> 00:09:12,951
      You know, with signs      
          of a beating          

196
00:09:13,003 --> 00:09:14,786
 or gunshot wounds to the face. 

197
00:09:14,871 --> 00:09:16,288
      We have none of that.     

198
00:09:16,373 --> 00:09:18,173
       - Maybe the killer       
        saw Santos' post        

199
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:20,792
      and left that message     
        to throw us off?        

200
00:09:20,844 --> 00:09:22,294
        - I was thinking        
         the same thing.        

201
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:24,346
    In fact, aspects of this    
       remind me of a case      

202
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:26,047
 I was consulting on last year. 

203
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:27,632
          - What case?          

204
00:09:27,684 --> 00:09:30,268
 - The death of a Michigan state
      senator, in Lansing.      

205
00:09:30,304 --> 00:09:32,270
         - I read that.         
      A mugging gone wrong?     

206
00:09:32,306 --> 00:09:34,189
       - Well, those were       
     the official findings,     

207
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:36,808
        but this guy had        
   some really shady dealings,  

208
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,312
    and I always thought that   
  the murder was more planned.  

209
00:09:40,364 --> 00:09:42,197
  - Do you think we're dealing  
      with the same killer?     

210
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:43,815
         - I don't know,        
      but the senator died      

211
00:09:43,867 --> 00:09:45,533
       from a single shot       
          to the heart,         

212
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:48,653
     and a jogger was caught    
   on video fleeing the scene.  

213
00:09:48,739 --> 00:09:51,706
       - Here's the jogger      
     from the Michigan case.    

214
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:56,378
      - I mean it could be      
          the same guy.         

215
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:58,296
    - Yeah, but he's wearing    
          a hoodie too.         

216
00:09:58,331 --> 00:09:59,831
         You can't tell.        

217
00:09:59,883 --> 00:10:03,668
 - Unless we compare the gaits. 

218
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,970
   We have a software that can  
             analyze            

219
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:07,889
        the biomechanics        
        of how he moves.        

220
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:10,725
   Your gait can be as unique   
      as your fingerprint.      

221
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:26,274
           91% match.           

222
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:29,194
     The Michigan jogger and    
 the Central Park West jogger-- 

223
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,829
    they're the same person.    

224
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:34,833
- Looks to me like Rob McCann's 
murder was a professional hit.  

225
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:45,693
  <i> For mild-to-moderate eczema,</i> 
       <i> EUCRISA can be...</i>

00:11:08,185 --> 00:11:10,935
  <i> The most common side effect</i>  
   <i> is application site pain.</i>   

237
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:13,104
 <i> Ask your doctor about EUCRISA.</i>

238
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:15,774
       How did we test our      
       Dixie Ultra plates?      

239
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:19,494
    With two pounds of steak.   

240
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:21,112
          In each hand.         

241
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,082
          Dixie Ultra.          

242
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:26,785
    Stress tested so you can    
     stress less at dinner.     

243
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,654
        Booking a flight        
       at the last minute       

244
00:11:29,673 --> 00:11:31,005
 doesn't have to be expensive.  

245
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:32,290
     Just go to priceline.      

246
00:11:32,342 --> 00:11:33,792
      It's the best place       
        to book a flight        

247
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:35,159
   a few days before my trip    

248
00:11:35,178 --> 00:11:37,128
   and still save up to 40%.    

249
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,664
       Just tap and go...       

250
00:11:39,683 --> 00:11:40,932
For the best savings on flights,

251
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:42,300
        go to priceline.        

252
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:44,686
      In terms of treating      
          sensitivity,          

253
00:11:44,721 --> 00:11:46,437
     3 days is really fast.     

254
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:48,039
          The dentist           
 is going to be able to provide 

255
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:49,207
     that to their patients.    

256
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:52,277
  Sensodyne Rapid Relief in my  
   opinion is a game changer.   

257
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:54,813
  It's going to let the dentist 
       offer their patient      

258
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:57,215
  sensitivity relief in 3 days. 

259
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,017
      It has a formulation      

260
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,052
  that lays down a barrier of   

261
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,454
protection against sensitivity. 

262
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,391
  Within 3 days, say over the   
      course of a weekend       

263
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:08,693
 you're going to start feeling  
      significant results.      

264
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,828
To say that it works in         

265
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:12,630
3 days really is                
a big deal.                     

266
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:18,930
      - People, please turn     
          your hymnals          

267
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,431
         to section 1958        
       of the federal code      

268
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,550
      with the snappy title     
       "Murder for Hire."       

269
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,302
 We now believe McCann's killer 
            is a pro            

270
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:27,355
    who also took out a state   
  senator in Lansing last year. 

271
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,891
   - Quantico's video analysis  
   indicates that the suspect   

272
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,477
        is a white male,        
      30 to 40's, 6" tall.      

273
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:34,112
          - Let's call          
      Lansing area hotels.      

274
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,563
   Get the names of the guests  
        that checked out        

275
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,315
           right after          
      the senator's murder.     

276
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,200
  Our guy may be on that list.  

277
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:41,653
   - I was doing my residency   
          at St. Luke's         

278
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:45,873
      when Rob was embedded     
  with the Marines in Fallujah. 

279
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:49,544
   That's when I was terrified  
          I'd lose him.         

280
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:53,665
            Not now.            
            Not here.           

281
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,416
 I don't know what I'm gonna do.

282
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:59,837
       - We're very sorry       
         for your loss.         

283
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:08,062
- So someone hired              
this man to...                  

284
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:09,731
Why?                            
Over something Rob wrote?       

285
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:11,182
      - We're not sure yet.     

286
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,017
     Did he have any issues     
      with drugs? Gambling?     

287
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:14,519
- No. Nothing like that.        

288
00:14:14,571 --> 00:14:18,156
    - Has he been worried lately
                   or concerned?

289
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,441
- If anything, he was excited   

290
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,410
about a new story               
he was working on.              

291
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:23,828
          - What story?         

292
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,831
    - He wasn't ready to talk   
          about it yet.         

293
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,032
         He said it was         
        the sort of thing       

294
00:14:28,084 --> 00:14:30,034
   that could win a Pulitzer.   

295
00:14:30,086 --> 00:14:33,037
        - Most reporters        
         keep notebooks.        

296
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:34,422
   Did your husband have one?   

297
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:36,958
             - Yes.             
          - Is it here?         

298
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:40,128
    - He carried it with him.   
 - It wasn't found on his body. 

299
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,596
         - Are you sure?        

300
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:44,098
     Rob never went anywhere    
      without his notebook.     

301
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,721
  That's significant, isn't it? 

302
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,023
         - It might be.         

303
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,308
 Do you have any idea why he was
     in the park last night?    

304
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,644
     - I don't know exactly.    

305
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,229
  When we talked on the phone,  
           he did say           

306
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,565
         he was planning        
     to meet with a source.     

307
00:15:00,617 --> 00:15:02,734
 - A source on this news story? 

308
00:15:02,786 --> 00:15:05,703
       - Yes, I think so.       

309
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:10,141
- I talked to Rob's editor      
and his colleagues.             

310
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,826
He didn't tell them             
about the story either.         

311
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,911
     - Well, whatever it is,    
  I think it's the key to this. 

312
00:15:13,963 --> 00:15:15,663
      What does his browser     
          history show?         

313
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:18,082
     - Mostly stuff for articles
         he had in the pipeline,

314
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:21,219
        except for some searches
          on pediatric oncology.

315
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,971
- Does Rob have a kid           
in his circle who has cancer?   

316
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:25,256
         - Not that we can find.

317
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,974
            <i> - Okay.</i>            
    <i> What about this source?</i>    

318
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,394
   <i> Any phone calls that point</i>  
     <i> to who that might be?</i>     

319
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,429
    - Rob did get some calls    
      from a burner phone,      

320
00:15:31,481 --> 00:15:33,314
 but we're still trying to trace
       who it belongs to.       

321
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,349
   - And Rob McCann's autopsy   
      report just dropped.      

322
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,902
        Looks like he had       
   a 0.07 blood alcohol level.  

323
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,904
        - Okay, so he met       
     his source for drinks.     

324
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,489
     <i> - That is my takeaway.</i>    

325
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:43,691
       - Could you put any      
   of those drinks on a card?   

326
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,410
              - No.             
   It looks like he paid cash.  

327
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:49,363
  He withdrew $100 from an ATM  
      on 67th and Columbus.     

328
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,865
 - Can you shoot us over a list 

329
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,417
         of all the bars        
  and restaurants in the area?  

330
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:53,951
 - Hold on. I might not need to.

331
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:55,787
      Checking past credit      
          card charges.         

332
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,007
    I see two visits to a bar   
   a block away from that ATM.  

333
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:04,345
     - Yeah, I remember him.    
    He sat right over there.    

334
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:06,347
  Ordered two glasses of pinot. 

335
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:10,518
    Hey, my shift just ended.   
    Is this gonna take long?    

336
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:12,303
  - It will with that attitude. 

337
00:16:12,355 --> 00:16:14,722
        Who was he with?        
         - He was alone.        

338
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:17,358
  It seemed like he was waiting 
 for someone, but nobody showed,

339
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:18,943
    so he paid up and split.    

340
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,528
     - Anybody come in after    
            he left?            

341
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:23,364
     Maybe looking for him?     
             - Nope.            

342
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,816
There was a guy.                

343
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:26,567
           - What guy?          
      - He was at the bar.      

344
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:29,036
        When pinot left,        
    he left right after him.    

345
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:30,988
 - Do you have security cameras?

346
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,876
     - Just the one pointed     
 at the till to keep us honest. 

347
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:36,244
      - The guy at the bar.     

348
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,713
    Have you seen him before?   
        Maybe a regular?        

349
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:40,882
   - Definitely not a regular.  

350
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:43,167
     - Why are you so sure?     

351
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:45,837
    - He tried to play a song   
         on the jukebox.        

352
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,306
        The regulars know       
   it hasn't worked in months.  

353
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:52,009
   <i> - The bad news is there's</i>   
  <i> no cameras outside the bar,</i>  

354
00:16:52,061 --> 00:16:54,011
     so we couldn't get eyes    
   on whoever followed McCann,  

355
00:16:54,063 --> 00:16:56,597
    but here's the good news:   
    ERT lifted a primo print

703

    - Agent Bell. We searched   
      the Patterson house.      

704
00:35:00,232 --> 00:35:02,732
     Nothing much stood out,    
        except for this.

 The First Central Savings Bank.
      That was a week ago.      

708
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:13,993

         he put in there        

709
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,996

          - All right.          

710
00:35:17,082 --> 00:35:19,916
     Let's go check it out.     

711
00:35:21,753 --> 00:35:24,754
 - Maggie, may I have a moment? 

712
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,144
         I'm a profiler.        
         I read people.         

713

         I need to know?        

714
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:35,815
          - No, ma'am.          

715
00:35:35,901 --> 00:35:39,102
 - I ask because a personal bias
   can affect one's instincts.

     or move away too late.     

718
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:46,442

          on this one.

          Frank Cutler          

720
00:35:47,996 --> 00:35:49,612
       is a fake identity,      

721
00:35:49,664 --> 00:35:51,915
     but the trail of bodies    
     he's left is very real.    

722
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:54,117
   - He's killed other people?  
      - So far we've found      

723
00:35:54,169 --> 00:35:56,485
         nine suspected         
 contract killings in six states

724
00:35:56,538 --> 00:35:58,872
   where Cutler just happened   
       to be in the area.       

725
00:35:58,957 --> 00:36:00,456
    We're taking a fresh look   
       at all those cases,      

726
00:36:00,542 --> 00:36:03,009
      including the killing     
     of that state senator.     

727
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:04,627
     I know you want to take    
     this man down, Maggie,     

728
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:07,013
  but he is lethally dangerous. 

729
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:10,633
  If you find out where he is,  
   I need you to call in SWAT.  

730
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:14,103
             - Okay.            

731
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:28,985
          - Thank you.          

732
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:35,491
      - All that's missing      
         is a drum roll.

00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:45,835
I don't know what I was         
expecting, but it wasn't that.  

734
00:36:45,921 --> 00:36:48,922
   - There's no imprint on them,
          so not pharmaceutical.

735
00:36:49,007 --> 00:36:52,809
- Street drugs?                 
Why rent a box to stash those?  

736
00:36:52,844 --> 00:36:56,012
   - Well, maybe it'll make more
    sense once the lab IDs them.

737
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:58,982
          - I'm sorry,          
     but I have a situation.    

738
00:36:59,017 --> 00:37:01,017

00:37:01,102 --> 00:37:03,987

  - He wants access to his box. 

740
00:37:04,022 --> 00:37:05,588

        my grandparents.        

1050
00:58:18,527 --> 00:58:19,559
         I was getting          
        all these leaves        

1051
00:58:19,578 --> 00:58:21,228
      and I was going back      
  generation after generation.  

1052
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:22,729
        You start to see        
     documents and you see      

1053
00:58:22,748 --> 00:58:25,032
         signatures of          
 people that you've never met.  

1054
00:58:25,067 --> 00:58:26,417
       I mean, you don't        
       know these people,       

1055
00:58:26,452 --> 00:58:28,585
          but you feel          
          like you do.          

1056
00:58:28,621 --> 00:58:29,569
       You get connected        
            to them.            

1057
00:58:29,588 --> 00:58:30,904
      I wish that I could       
    get into a time machine     

1058
00:58:30,923 --> 00:58:32,406
          and go back           
      100 years, 200 years      

1059
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:33,841
         and just meet          
         these people.          

1060
00:58:33,876 --> 00:58:35,959
       Being on Ancestry        
       just made me feel        

1061
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:37,577
        like I belonged         
           somewhere.

1066
00:58:46,839 --> 00:58:50,391
   I'm here for an important    
reason. Colon cancer screening. 

1067
00:58:50,426 --> 00:58:53,560
There's a bunch of places where 
  screening wouldn't be easy.   

1068
00:58:53,596 --> 00:58:55,429
           Like here.

1070
00:58:56,899 --> 00:58:58,398
             Nope!              

1071
00:58:58,434 --> 00:59:01,602
   But here's a place you can   
screen for colon cancer anytime.

1072
00:59:01,637 --> 00:59:02,686
        With Cologuard.

   Without any special prep.    

1074
00:59:05,324 --> 00:59:08,075
  There really is no place...   
           like home.           

1075
00:59:08,110 --> 00:59:09,476
        <i> Cologuard is not</i>       
      <i> right for everyone,</i>      

1076

     <i> if it's right for you.</i>    

1077
00:59:13,332 --> 00:59:14,331
      Why shop Marshalls?       

1078
00:59:14,333 --> 00:59:15,582
           Because...           

1079
00:59:15,584 --> 00:59:16,867
 Their prices will thrill you.  

1080
00:59:16,869 --> 00:59:18,035
                       Whoo-hoo!
