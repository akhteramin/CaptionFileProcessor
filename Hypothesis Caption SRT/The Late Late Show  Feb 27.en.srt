1478
00:49:46,161 --> 00:49:47,294
     No matter who you are,     

1479
00:49:47,413 --> 00:49:49,162
   it's important to go for an  
        annual check-up,        

1480
00:49:49,248 --> 00:49:51,131
 and when you do remember to be 
         open and honest        

1481
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:52,966
   with your doctor about how   
         you're feeling.        

1482
00:49:53,085 --> 00:49:54,751

  fill out the medical history.

1488
00:50:06,482 --> 00:50:07,630
 Go in for your annual check-up,

1489
00:50:07,733 --> 00:50:10,300
   and check in physically and
