249
00:07:38,793 --> 00:07:40,760
SLOW THE GAME DOWN.             
TEXAS TECH CAN DO THAT, BUT WE

 EPCLUSA treats all main types  
       of chronic Hep C.        

475
00:16:04,533 --> 00:16:06,299
      Whatever your type,       
        ask your doctor         

476
00:16:06,335 --> 00:16:09,269
if EPCLUSA is your kind of cure.

477

       EPCLUSA has a 98%        
       overall cure rate.       

480
00:16:16,745 --> 00:16:19,646
        I just found out

484
00:16:26,355 --> 00:16:28,288
    Before starting EPCLUSA,    
        your doctor will        

485
00:16:28,323 --> 00:16:30,991
      test if you have had      
hepatitis B, which may flare up 

486
00:16:31,026 --> 00:16:33,026
        and could cause         
     serious liver problems

    cause a serious slowing
