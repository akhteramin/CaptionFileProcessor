  There was a moment, my son I  
    believe was about four,     

704
00:23:49,018 --> 00:23:50,951
   where he actually asked me   
      "Mommy what's wrong       
       with your teeth?"        

705
00:23:50,987 --> 00:23:53,854
 If I would've known that I was 
  gonna be 50 tiier...          

706
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,257

"ONE MORE THING" IS UP NEXT.    

1426
00:52:16,782 --> 00:52:18,916
Introducing... Smartdogs.       

1427
00:52:18,984 --> 00:52:21,819
The first dogs trained to train 
humans.                         

1428
00:52:21,854 --> 00:52:23,921
Stopping drivers from: Liking.  

1429
00:52:23,956 --> 00:52:25,589
Selfie-ing.                     

1430
00:52:25,658 --> 00:52:28,625
And whatever this is.           

1431
00:52:28,661 --> 00:52:31,795
Available to the public...      
never.                          

1432
00:52:31,831 --> 00:52:33,597
Smartdogs are not the answer.   

1433
00:52:33,666 --> 00:52:35,265
But GEICO has a simple tip.     

1434
00:52:35,301 --> 00:52:38,902
Turn on "Do Not Disturb While   
Driving" mode.                  

1435
00:52:38,938 --> 00:52:40,871
Brought to you by GEICO.        

1436
00:52:41,706 --> 00:52:43,007
     Excuse me a minute...      

1437
00:52:43,809 --> 00:52:47,544
          Hi Dad. No.           
      Don't try to get up.      

1438
00:52:48,114 --> 00:52:51,215
       Hi, I'm Julie, a         
    Right at Home caregiver.    

1439
00:52:51,317 --> 00:52:52,883
    And if I'd been caring      
         for Tom's dad,         

1440
00:52:52,952 --> 00:52:54,351
      I would have noticed      
      some dizziness that       

1441
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:56,086
 could lead to balance issues.  

1442
00:52:56,155 --> 00:52:58,756
 That's because I'm trained to  
report any changes in behavior, 

1443
00:52:58,824 --> 00:53:02,226
  no matter how small, so Tom   
   could have peace of mind.    

1444
00:53:02,295 --> 00:53:03,427
     We'll be right there.      

1445
00:53:04,397 --> 00:53:05,563
         We have to go.         

1446
00:53:05,631 --> 00:53:07,698
           Hey, Tom.            
 You should try Right at Home.  

1447
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:08,899
     They're great for us.      

1448
00:53:08,968 --> 00:53:10,968
The Right Care. Right at Home.  

1449
00:53:26,384 --> 00:53:28,586
       It's tough to quit       
      smoking cold turkey.      

1450
00:53:28,588 --> 00:53:31,422
       So CHANTIX can help      
     you quit “slow turkey.”    

1451
00:53:31,424 --> 00:53:32,256
       Along with support,      

1452
00:53:32,258 --> 00:53:34,425
       CHANTIX is proven        
       to help you quit.        

1453
00:53:34,427 --> 00:53:36,761
      With CHANTIX you can      
      keep smoking at first     

1454
00:53:36,763 --> 00:53:37,962
     and ease into quitting     

1455
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:38,929
    so when the day arrives,    

1456
00:53:38,931 --> 00:53:42,133
    you'll be more ready to     
    kiss cigarettes goodbye.    

1457
00:53:42,368 --> 00:53:43,834
          When you try          
        to quit smoking,        

1458
00:53:43,836 --> 00:53:44,769
            with or             
        without CHANTIX,        

1459
00:53:44,771 --> 00:53:46,737
      you may have nicotine     
      withdrawal symptoms.      

1460
00:53:46,739 --> 00:53:48,239
        Stop CHANTIX and        
       get help right away      

1461
00:53:48,241 --> 00:53:50,107
     if you have changes in     
     behavior or thinking,      

1462
00:53:50,109 --> 00:53:52,543
     aggression, hostility,     
        depressed mood,         

1463
00:53:52,545 --> 00:53:54,979
        suicidal thoughts       
      or actions, seizures,     

1464
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:56,781
     new or worse heart or      
     blood vessel problems,     

1465
00:53:56,783 --> 00:53:58,783
        sleepwalking, or        
    life-threatening allergic   

1466
00:53:58,785 --> 00:53:59,784
       and skin reactions.      

1467
00:53:59,786 --> 00:54:01,052
      Decrease alcohol use.     

1468
00:54:01,054 --> 00:54:03,321
     Use caution driving or     
      operating machinery.      

1469
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:05,589
   Tell your doctor if you've   
   had mental health problems.  

1470
00:54:05,591 --> 00:54:08,025
        The most common         
     side effect is nausea.     

1471
00:54:08,027 --> 00:54:10,428
       Talk to your doctor      
         about CHANTIX.         

1472
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:11,355
        The most common         
     side effect is nausea.     

1473
00:55:11,523 --> 00:55:13,591
  Since you're heading off to   
 school, I got you this Brita.  

1474
00:55:13,626 --> 00:55:15,093
 Dad... I just got a ZeroWater. 

1475
00:55:15,161 --> 00:55:16,360
  But we've always used Brita.  

1476
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:17,762
    it's two stage-filter...    

1477
00:55:17,831 --> 00:55:20,164
 doesn't compare to ZeroWater's 
            5-stage.            

1478
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:21,766
   This meter shows how much    
            stuff,              

1479
00:55:21,835 --> 00:55:23,768
 or dissolved solids, gets left 
            behind.             

1480
00:55:23,837 --> 00:55:28,673
     Our tap water is 220.      

1481
00:55:28,708 --> 00:55:30,375
         Brita? 110...          

1482
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:31,342
           Seriously?           

1483
00:55:31,378 --> 00:55:32,176
         but ZeroWater-         

1484
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:33,711
      Let me guess. Zero?       

1485
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:38,016
  Yup, that's how I know it is  
   the purest-tasting water.    

1486
00:55:38,051 --> 00:55:39,651
