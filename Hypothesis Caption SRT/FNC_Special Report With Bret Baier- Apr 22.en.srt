  than anywhere with migraine.  

938
00:35:46,438 --> 00:35:48,171
          "I am here."          

939
00:35:48,207 --> 00:35:50,540
  And I aim to say that more.   

940
00:35:50,576 --> 00:35:51,608
           Aimovig...           

941
00:35:51,643 --> 00:35:53,510
   a preventive treatment for   
     migraine in adults...      

942
00:35:53,545 --> 00:35:56,012
 reduces the number of monthly  
         migraine days.         

943
00:35:56,048 --> 00:35:58,749
For some, that number can be cut
        in half or more.        

944
00:35:58,784 --> 00:36:00,584
  The most common side effects  
           are pain,            

945
00:36:00,619 --> 00:36:04,054
   redness or swelling at the   
injection site and constipation.

946
00:36:04,089 --> 00:36:05,889
     Aim to be there more.      

947
00:36:05,924 --> 00:36:07,491
      Talk to your doctor       
         about Aimovig.         

948
00:36:10,495 --> 00:36:11,361
  (Mom VO) It's easy to shrink  

949
00:36:12,031 --> 00:36:12,529
  into your own little world.   

950
00:36:15,034 --> 00:36:16,366
     Especially these days.     

951
00:36:17,036 --> 00:36:18,035
    (Dad) I think it's here.    

952
00:36:19,038 --> 00:36:20,037
(Mom VO) Especially at this age.

953
00:36:20,372 --> 00:36:21,338
(Big sister) Where are we going?

954
00:36:23,876 --> 00:36:25,876
 (Mom VO) It's a big, beautiful 
 world out there.               

955
00:36:25,978 --> 00:36:26,910
    (Little sister) Woah...     

956
00:36:27,012 --> 00:36:28,045
  (Big sister) Wow. See that?   

957
00:36:29,181 --> 00:36:30,847
(Mom VO) Sometimes you just need
a little help seeing it.        

958
00:36:31,717 --> 00:36:34,051
  (VO) Presenting the all-new   
  three-row Subaru Ascent.      

959
00:36:34,553 --> 00:36:37,788
 Love is now bigger than ever.  

960
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,154
       My reputation was        
        trashed online,         

961
00:37:10,189 --> 00:37:12,289
  I felt completely helpless.   

962
00:37:12,324 --> 00:37:14,792
 My entire career and business  
       were in jeopardy.        

963
00:37:14,827 --> 00:37:17,094
 I called Reputation Defender.  

964
00:37:17,129 --> 00:37:19,296
   They were able to restore    
         my good name.          

965
00:37:19,331 --> 00:37:20,130
    If you're under attack,     

966
00:37:20,166 --> 00:37:21,098
      I recommend calling       

967
00:37:21,133 --> 00:37:22,666
      Reputation Defender.      

968
00:37:22,702 --> 00:37:24,802
   And consider joining their   
    groundbreaking campaign     

969
00:37:24,837 --> 00:37:27,471
   to give every American the   
      right to remove old,

going to righttobeforgotten.org.

972
00:37:31,177 --> 00:37:33,143
If you have search results that 
      are wrong or unfair,      

973
00:37:33,179 --> 00:37:34,278
    call Reputation Defender
