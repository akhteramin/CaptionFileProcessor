I THINK AS TIME IS GOING ON,

00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:38,663
FOLKS AROUND THE PRESIDENT ARE  
BECOMING MORE AWARE OF THE FACT

IT WOULD BE THE WHITE HOUSE WHO 
WOULD HAVE TO TECHNICALLY ASSERT

WHAT WILLIAM BARR COULD DO HERE?
COULD HE IDENTIFY AREAS AND KEEP

COULD HE IDENTIFY AREAS AND KEEP
THEM REDACTED BECAUSE OF THE    

461
00:11:55,635 --> 00:11:57,202
THEM REDACTED BECAUSE OF THE

HE DOESN'T CARE SPLITTING WITH  
HIS OWN ADMINISTRATION IF HE

I THINK HE VALUES SENDING A     

1803
00:59:02,689 --> 00:59:04,289
I THINK HE VALUES SENDING A     
MESSAGE TO HIS BASE THAT HE'S   

1804
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:06,358
MESSAGE TO HIS BASE THAT HE'S   
HIS OWN INDEPENDENT GUY.

00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:07,359
HIS OWN INDEPENDENT GUY.        
HE'S NOT ONLY NOT BEHOLDEN TO

PARTY, IN HIS OWN WHITE HOUSE.  

1809
00:59:12,633 --> 00:59:13,632
PARTY, IN HIS OWN WHITE HOUSE.  
AND THAT'S THE REASON HE'S GOT  

1810
00:59:13,634 --> 00:59:16,268
AND THAT'S THE REASON HE'S GOT  
THIS HUGE AMOUNT OF TURNOVER.   

1811
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:17,335
THIS HUGE AMOUNT OF TURNOVER.   
I THINK IF YOU TAKE ALL FOUR

00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:21,506
COMBINED, I DON'T THINK THERE   
WAS AS MUCH TURNOVER AS THERE

WAS AS MUCH TURNOVER AS THERE

SOMETHING DISINGENUOUS ABOUT IT.

1819
00:59:28,816 --> 00:59:30,916
SOMETHING DISINGENUOUS ABOUT IT.
