"There's a lot of fish out there
    to catch, go catch 'em."    

123
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:59,201
   Narrator: And while Rafael   
   may enjoy fishing for fun,   

124
00:06:59,203 --> 00:07:04,172
   for business, he sends his   
 captains out to catch the fish.

125
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:07,008
     He stays on the shore.     

126
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,045
  Kendall: No, no, he was never 
        a true fisherman.       

127
00:07:10,047 --> 00:07:11,546
   Carlos was a lot of things,  

128
00:07:11,548 --> 00:07:13,465
      but that's one thing      
         he can't claim.        

129
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:18,386
 Narrator: And for many, that is
   a significant distinction,   

130
00:07:18,388 --> 00:07:19,971
 because professional fishermen 

131
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:23,191
    are people who routinely    
head out into treacherous waters

132
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:26,311
     in what is still one of    
 the most dangerous professions 

133
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:28,814
         in the country.        

134
00:07:28,816 --> 00:07:32,851
People who have been out at sea,
      they learn humility.      

135
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:36,521
     You look at a big wave     
         or a big storm,        

136
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:39,074
    you understand humility.    

137
00:07:39,076 --> 00:07:46,998
   And every fisherman I know   
       has that humility.       

138
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,170
There's not an ounce of humility
        in Carlos Rafael.       

139
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:56,725
    Narrator: Almost everyone   
   who meets him learns that.   

140
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:59,561
           As he tells          
   the IRS undercover agents,   

141
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:03,482
  he is among the smartest guys 
          on the docks.         

142
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:17,195
       And one of the most      
  important things Rafael knows 

143
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:21,082
      is that, to succeed,      
     he needs lots of boats.    

144
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:24,019
    Bigger is always better.    

145
00:08:42,873 --> 00:08:44,539
          [ Laughter ]          

146
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:45,907
      Lelling: He's really      
      kind of a character.      

147
00:08:45,909 --> 00:08:48,593
      He's sort of a loud,      
         boisterous guy.        

148
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:52,113
        He's very funny.        
      He's really profane.      

149
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,983
        He is memorable.        

150
00:08:54,985 --> 00:08:58,153
  Narrator: As Carlos Rafael's  
         business grows,        

151
00:08:58,155 --> 00:09:01,105
    it appears that his story   
        is a classic tale       

152
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:05,410
    of an immigrant achieving   
       the American Dream.      

153
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:09,280
     Here's a young man who     
  moved here from his homeland  

154
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,466
      at a very young age,      
  with little formal education, 

155
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:14,252
 and worked some very hard jobs 
          on the docks          

156
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:16,905
   and eventually saved money   
     to build up a business.    

157
00:09:16,907 --> 00:09:20,175
     And that's laudable in     
    the most fundamental ways   

158
00:09:20,177 --> 00:09:23,261
    that we Americans value.    

159
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:27,933
  Narrator: But Rafael's story  
      is more complicated.      

160
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:32,821
Early on, people who do business
  with him learn to be careful. 

161
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:35,190
Well, if I shook hands with him,
  I guess I'd count my fingers  

162
00:09:35,192 --> 00:09:37,192
       after I got through      
     shaking hands with him,    

163
00:09:37,194 --> 00:09:39,978
    based on his reputation.    

164
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,948
 Narrator: It is no secret that 
Rafael will agree to pay a price

165
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:46,317
       for a load of fish       
     at the morning auction,    

166
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:50,038
       but it is often not      
         a final price.         

167
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,508
   Kendall: The one time that   
     Carlos bought my trip,     

168
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,012
       I actually ended up      
      not selling to Carlos     

169
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:58,964
        because he tried        
        to cut the price        

170
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:00,665
   that he had agreed to pay,   

171
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:05,720
 and I refused to let him do so.

172
00:10:05,722 --> 00:10:10,141
Narrator: Rafael says he is just
    protecting his business.    

173
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:23,354
       But it's one thing       
       to gouge fishermen,      

174
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:26,975
      and another to cheat      
      the U.S. government.      

175
00:10:26,977 --> 00:10:29,961
    For years, Rafael thinks    
        the U.S. can wait       

176
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,030
      for his tax payments.     

177
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:34,749
     But the IRS disagrees.     

178
00:10:34,751 --> 00:10:40,088
He's prosecuted for tax evasion,
     by my office, in 1986.     

179
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:42,891
      And he was convicted      
          in that case.         

180
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:47,012
     Narrator: Rafael serves    
     four months in prison.     

181
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:49,347
            Mitchell:           
    Most people would respond   
   to an experience like that   

182
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:50,732
    and say, "You know what,    

183
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:53,217
    I'm never gonna let that    
      happen to me again."      

184
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:56,688
         But that wasn't        
        Carlos' reaction.       

185
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,523
     Narrator: No, it's not.    

186
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:00,558
Rafael's reaction is to continue

187
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,512
      to draw the attention     
       of law enforcement.      

188
00:11:04,514 --> 00:11:08,399
    And it's not long before    
 a second indictment comes down.

189
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:12,203
    This time, he is charged    
       with price fixing.       

190
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:14,372
   Lelling: The allegation was  
        he was colluding        

191
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:17,092
 with other commercial fishermen
         in New Bedford         

192
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:19,461
          to set prices         
    on certain kinds of fish.   

193
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:30,271
            Narrator:           
   But he pulls out his charm   

194
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:34,275
        and, as he says,        
       "played the jury."       

195
00:11:43,053 --> 00:11:45,053
       His strategy works.      

196
00:11:45,055 --> 00:11:49,224
    The jury takes his side,    
      and he is acquitted.      

197
00:11:49,226 --> 00:11:50,925
         As he walks out        
        of the courtroom,       

198
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:53,762
        he has a message        
      for the prosecutors.      

199
00:12:05,342 --> 00:12:11,179
  That pretty well encapsulates 
  his feelings about authority. 

200
00:12:11,181 --> 00:12:13,598
     He is not gonna be told    
           what to do           

201
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,767
     by anybody at any time.    

202
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:21,322
  He's his own person, and the  
rules just weren't made for him.

203
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:26,828

217
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:47,358
 Actually, you're still at risk 

218

    for a fatal heart attack    
           or stroke.

222
00:13:53,316 --> 00:13:55,600
  That's why I asked my doctor  
    what else I could do...     

223
00:13:55,619 --> 00:13:57,318
  she told me about JARDIANCE.  

224

         That's right.

289

      a chance to rebound,      

290
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:52,126

291
00:16:52,128 --> 00:16:56,781

295
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:09,093
   And the rules are complex,   
        to say the least.       

296
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:11,979
 I mean, our rules are literally
           that thick.

298
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,433
            Narrator:           
   The fishermen are furious.   

299
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:17,185
        They see not only       
        their livelihood,       

300
00:17:17,187 --> 00:17:21,105
    but an entire way of life   
   on the brink of extinction.  

301
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:23,691
    The new regulations means   
     you're out of business.    

302
00:17:23,693 --> 00:17:25,142
  I'm gonna lose everything --  

303
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:26,494

          for 35 years.         

304
00:17:26,496 --> 00:17:28,579
   It's only a matter of time.  

305
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:30,815
  We're trying to survive here. 

306
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:33,317
      Bullard: Think about      
      what kind of a person     

307
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:36,654
         wants to go out        
     and brave the elements.    

308
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:39,674
        They're fiercely        
       independent people.      

309
00:17:39,676 --> 00:17:41,626
      They're not the kind      
       of person who says,      

310
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:43,828
     "Oh, hey, regulate me."    

311
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,346
   I got no money!              

312
00:17:45,348 --> 00:17:47,515
  You and everybody             
  talking, talking!

314
00:17:49,185 --> 00:17:51,302
  Narrator: And while fishermen 
      with small operations     

315
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:53,054
         are yelling...

316
00:17:53,056 --> 00:17:57,692
     ...Carlos Rafael knows     
        he will survive.        

317
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,485
  In Rafael's mind, "the weak"  
  are the hundreds of fishermen 

318
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:13,241
 who operate one or two boats --
    people like Rodman Sykes.   

319
00:18:13,243 --> 00:18:15,877
            Sykes is            
  a third-generation fisherman  

320
00:18:15,879 --> 00:18:20,164
   operating near New Bedford,  
 in Point Judith, Rhode Island. 

321
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,216
      The only other thing      
       I ever wanted to do      

322
00:18:22,218 --> 00:18:23,835
      was play second base      
        for the Red Sox,        

323
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:25,419
 and that didn't work out, so...

324
00:18:25,421 --> 00:18:28,372
           [ Laughs ]           
    So I became a fisherman.    

325
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:31,559
     Narrator: Sykes begins     
       his fishing career       

326
00:18:31,561 --> 00:18:34,645
        at the same time        
  Rafael enters the industry -- 

327
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:36,564
      in the good ol' days.     

328
00:18:36,566 --> 00:18:38,766
 Sykes: Back then, you could do 
   whatever you wanted to do.   

329
00:18:38,768 --> 00:18:40,101
 I mean, you throw the lines off

330
00:18:40,103 --> 00:18:41,736
         and go fishing         
      whenever you wanted,      

331
00:18:41,738 --> 00:18:43,905
   catch whatever you wanted.   

332
00:18:43,907 --> 00:18:46,357
 Narrator: But then he is faced 
        with regulations        

333
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:49,076
    that limit the horsepower   
           on his boat          

334
00:18:49,078 --> 00:18:52,062
  and dictate that he use nets  
         with wider mesh        

335
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:55,065
     to decrease his catch.     

336
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:59,871
    It was just going from no   
 restrictions to that was scary.

337
00:18:59,873 --> 00:19:01,238
  You know, you're hauling net, 

338
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,790
           and you see          
   these great, big flounders   

339
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:04,125
        swimming on right       
        through the mesh,       

340
00:19:04,127 --> 00:19:05,743
     just go, swimming away.    

341
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:08,045
             I said,            
  "We can't possibly do this."  

342
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:12,700
  Narrator: But the most severe 
 restriction for some fishermen 

343
00:19:12,702 --> 00:19:17,889
  is a limitation on the number 
  of days a boat can be at sea. 

344
00:19:17,891 --> 00:19:21,091
     Over time, as the fish     
         don't rebound,         

345
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:26,063
       the number of days       
    gets smaller and smaller.   

346
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:28,316
    Bullard: If someone says,   

347
00:19:28,318 --> 00:19:32,787
 "I'm going to reduce the number
     of days you can fish,"     

348
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:34,739
  that hits the family budget.  

349
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:36,157
     That has consequences.     

350
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:40,077
          That may mean         
     that the captain says,     

351
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:42,463
          "Sorry, guys,         
     we're not gonna be able    

352
00:19:42,465 --> 00:19:44,415
  to provide health insurance," 

353
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:50,338
         in the nation's        
       most dangerous job.      

354
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,007
  Narrator: And that means that 
     thousands of fishermen     

355
00:19:53,009 --> 00:19:55,476
 are forced out of the business.

356
00:19:57,647 --> 00:20:00,748
 But Carlos Rafael is thriving. 

357
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,100
   He has added scallop boats   
          to his fleet,         

358
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:07,137
   and they more than make up   
  for the losses in groundfish. 

359
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:10,474
     He was doing quite fine    
     running his scallopers,    

360
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:11,859
       no doubt about it,       

361
00:20:11,861 --> 00:20:15,696
       and making millions      
    and millions of dollars.    

362
00:20:15,698 --> 00:20:18,115
 Narrator: And, as for all those
      rules and regulations     

363
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:20,451
     to protect groundfish?     

364
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:21,786
              Easy.             

365
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:24,705
      It appears he simply      
          ignores them.         

366
00:20:24,707 --> 00:20:27,124
 I don't think that he actively 
      sought to break them.     

367
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:29,377
         They just were         
       meaningless to him.      

368
00:20:29,379 --> 00:20:31,545
       "I'm just gonna do       
       what I want to do,       

369
00:20:31,547 --> 00:20:35,332
    because I want to do it."   

370
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:39,787
    Narrator: And, over time,   
     violations stack up --     

371
00:20:39,789 --> 00:20:44,642
     exceeded haddock limit,    
     fished in closed area,     

372
00:20:44,644 --> 00:20:47,344
   exceeded days at sea limit,  

373
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:50,698
         submitted false        
      daily-catch reports.      

374
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,000
    But, as he tells the IRS,   

375
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:56,537
      he is not intimidated     
    by government inspectors.   

376
00:21:07,717 --> 00:21:09,533
            Bullard:            
       He's incorrigible.       

377
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:14,722
    This is his way of life,    
   to break the law repeatedly  

378
00:21:14,724 --> 00:21:17,041
          and challenge         
     the federal government     

379
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:18,559
          to catch him          

380
00:21:18,561 --> 00:21:23,681
    and then catch him again    
    and then catch him again.   

381
00:21:23,683 --> 00:21:26,267
    Narrator: And the feds<i> do</i>   
     continue to catch him.     

382
00:21:26,269 --> 00:21:31,522
        In 1999, there is       
 a third indictment for Rafael. 

383
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:34,025
     This time, he is caught    
     lying on an application    

384
00:21:34,027 --> 00:21:36,444
  for a permit to catch squid,  

385
00:21:36,446 --> 00:21:39,747
     saying he has a history    
        in the business.        

386
00:21:39,749 --> 00:21:42,199
     Mullett: The government    
 followed up on that paperwork, 

387
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:44,401
and they found that these people

388
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,871
    had never purchased squid   
          from Carlos.          

389
00:21:46,873 --> 00:21:48,422
   One of the businesses said,  

390
00:21:48,424 --> 00:21:50,291
   "I wasn't even in business   

391
00:21:50,293 --> 00:21:55,262
  at the time that he allegedly 
       sold me the squid."      

392
00:21:55,264 --> 00:21:58,632
      Narrator: Rafael has      
      no defense this time.     

393
00:21:58,634 --> 00:22:02,252
 He pleads guilty to five counts
      of false statements,      

394
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:05,923
  and is sentenced to probation 
  and six months' house arrest. 

395
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:10,227
  And when the punishment ends, 
 it's back to business as usual.

396
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:16,400
     And his fines mount --     
  $25,000 here, $30,000 there.  

397
00:22:16,402 --> 00:22:18,268
    Those monetary penalties    
        probably would've       

398
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:21,605
    put the average fisherman   
        out of business.        

399
00:22:21,607 --> 00:22:24,909
    Narrator: But Rafael can    
        afford the fines.       

400
00:22:24,911 --> 00:22:29,463
At the time, he says he is worth
      at least $10 million.     

401
00:22:29,465 --> 00:22:34,418
        And that is when        
     The Codfather is born.     

402
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:39,473
   Bullard: He called himself   
        "The Codfather."        

403
00:22:39,475 --> 00:22:46,347
     So, he modeled himself     
      over a crime family.      

404
00:22:46,349 --> 00:22:50,634
        He wasn't ashamed       
     of being a lawbreaker.     

405
00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:54,739
      He bragged about it.      

406
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:57,808
   Narrator: And while Rafael   
   continually thumbs his nose  

407
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,443
       at law enforcement,      

408
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:03,781
    most other fishermen make   
  a different, painful choice.  

409
00:23:03,783 --> 00:23:06,150
        Sykes: None of us       
      like the regulations,     

410
00:23:06,152 --> 00:23:08,485
      but they're not just      
         for some people        

411
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:10,171
    and not others, you know,   

412
00:23:10,173 --> 00:23:16,460
     and I try to go by them    
     as well as I know them.    

413
00:23:17,847 --> 00:23:21,632
  Narrator: Next, Carlos Rafael 
       gets his big chance      

414
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:24,118
   to destroy his competition.

      This is Wells Fargo.      

429
00:26:45,288 --> 00:26:48,322
       Narrator: By 2009,       
    Carlos Rafael is running    

430
00:26:48,324 --> 00:26:51,241
       one of the largest       
commercial groundfish businesses

431
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:52,910
      in the United States.     

432
00:26:52,912 --> 00:26:57,047
      He proudly attributes     
  his success to his hard work. 

433
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:09,510
 At this point, he is a fixture 
 on the New Bedford Waterfront, 

434
00:27:09,512 --> 00:27:12,963
   often entertaining visitors  
    at a Waterfront festival    

435
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:16,266
    with his tips on cutting    
     and buying fresh fish.     

436
00:27:26,529 --> 00:27:29,947
     It appears that Rafael     
   is doing exceedingly well,   

437
00:27:29,949 --> 00:27:32,366
   but many of his competitors  
         are struggling         

438
00:27:32,368 --> 00:27:36,486
       to eke out a living      
  as the fish fail to rebound.  

439
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,372
        And a lolot of guys     
     didn't get through it.     

440
00:27:38,374 --> 00:27:42,859
  I have a lot of friends that  
  have gone, lost their boats.  

441
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:45,746
 Narrator: And, as more and more
    fishermen call it quits,    

442
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:50,000
     Rafael is there to take    
   their boat off their hands.  

443
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:52,836
    And that makes him a kind   
     of hero in New Bedford,    

444
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:56,890
      credited with keeping     
    a dying industry afloat.    

445
00:27:56,892 --> 00:27:58,892
            Kendall:            
     He kept vessels fishing    

446
00:27:58,894 --> 00:28:02,396
   which employed four or five  
       fishermen per boat,      

447
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:05,349
  several people on the shore.  

448
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:07,718
  There was a big upside to it. 

449
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,772
      Narrator: But Rafael      
    repeatedly makes it clear   

450
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:16,276
      that he doesn't care      
     about other fishermen.     

451
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:19,613
At a meeting where a proposal to
 provide emergency-relief money 

452
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:22,249
     to suffering fishermen     
          is discussed,         

453
00:28:22,251 --> 00:28:24,451
        Rafael speaks up.       

454
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:25,753
      Kendall: Carlos said,     
      "To hell with them."      

455
00:28:25,755 --> 00:28:27,371
        He says, "They're       
       just gonna spend it      

456
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:29,540
   on booze or drugs anyways."  

457
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:32,543
        I mean, that was        
        Carlos' opinion.        

458
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:35,596
 There was a young man who said 
    that he wanted to be able   

459
00:28:35,598 --> 00:28:39,016
      to get into fishing,      
   and Carlos said, you know,   

460
00:28:39,018 --> 00:28:41,435
       "This guy is never       
     gonna get into fishing.    

461
00:28:41,437 --> 00:28:43,754
      I am gonna squash him     
          like a bug."          

462
00:28:43,756 --> 00:28:45,606
     Quintessential Carlos.     

463
00:28:45,608 --> 00:28:48,642
  "I'll squash him like a bug." 

464
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:51,712
    Shelley: He would get up    
       at the mic and say,      

465
00:28:51,714 --> 00:28:56,216
      "I don't give a damn      
   about you small fishermen.   

466
00:28:56,218 --> 00:28:58,118
     I'm gonna get it all."     

467
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:04,742
       I mean, it was not       
     a veiled state of mind.    

468
00:29:04,744 --> 00:29:07,294
  Narrator: And then, in 2010,  

469
00:29:07,296 --> 00:29:10,781
       a new set of rules       
 is put in place for groundfish 

470
00:29:10,783 --> 00:29:13,917
     that gives him the edge    
       he is looking for.       

471
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:18,622
    For many, the days-at-sea   
       regulation is gone.      

472
00:29:18,624 --> 00:29:20,758
    Now government scientists   
         will determine         

473
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:24,595
  how many fish of each species 
    can be caught in a year,    

474
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:27,931
and each fisherman will be given
 a percentage of that number -- 

475
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:32,469
  a quota for how many they can 
   catch of each kind of fish.  

476
00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:36,740
   And then the boat can pick   
  and choose when it goes out,  

477
00:29:36,742 --> 00:29:38,475
    how many days it goes out   

478
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:42,696
     to catch its allotment     
          for the year.         

479
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:44,648
  Narrator: It's made to order  
       for Carlos Rafael,       

480
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:47,651
     because the percentage     
 a fisherman gets of a species, 

481
00:29:47,653 --> 00:29:51,455
     like cod, for example,     
    is based on how many cod    

482
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:54,708
       a fisherman caught       
        in recent years.        

483
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,878
   Shelley: So the people who   
       fished the hardest       

484
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,298
    on the most-stressed fish   
           were given           

485
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:07,971
    the biggest percentage of   
 the future quota on that fish. 

486
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:11,859
Narrator: And so, Rafael is able
   to obtain around 50 permits  

487
00:30:11,861 --> 00:30:15,512
        to catch millions       
       of pounds of fish.       

488
00:30:15,514 --> 00:30:18,115
            Lelling:            
  These quotas, these permits,  

489
00:30:18,117 --> 00:30:21,735
      were the lifeblood of     
 commercial fishing after 2010. 

490
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:24,371
  If you had a lot of permits,  
 you could do a lot of fishing, 

491
00:30:24,373 --> 00:30:25,656
 you could make a lot of money. 

492
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:27,407
       If you didn't have       
        a lot of permits,       

493
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:30,744
  then you couldn't do a lot of 
fishing and make a lot of money.

494
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:32,212
   Narrator: It sounds simple,  

495
00:30:32,214 --> 00:30:35,699
       but it is not when       
     it comes to groundfish,    

496
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:39,002
       and that is because      
    groundfish swim together.   

497
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:40,754
   And when the nets go down,   

498
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:44,391
        different species       
      get caught together.      

499
00:30:44,393 --> 00:30:48,345
   Lelling: So, whatever fish   
      is the lowest quota,      

500
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:50,714
   once you caught your quota   
          of that fish,         

501
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:52,516
    you had to stop fishing.    

502
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:56,052
So, if you caught all the yellow
 tail you were allowed to catch,

503
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:58,238
        you couldn't cast       
        your nets anymore       

504
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,440
     because you were gonna     
    pull in more yellow tail    

505
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:02,159
      among everything else     
        that you caught.        

506
00:31:02,161 --> 00:31:04,695
     And so you had to stop     
          right there.          

507
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:07,197
   Narrator: And, inevitably,   
         some fishermen         

508
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:10,033
   do not have enough permits   
      to stay in business.      

509
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:14,371
 And, once again, Carlos Rafael 
   is there to buy their boats  

510
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:18,208
       and their permits,       
  ostensibly bailing them out,  

511
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:21,762
        but also serving        
     his personal ambition.     

512
00:31:39,932 --> 00:31:44,151
   This may be Rafael's moment  
      to get total control.     

513
00:31:44,153 --> 00:31:48,922
    But that does not mean he   
 will stop also trying to steal.

514
00:31:48,924 --> 00:31:50,724
        In October 2013,        

515
00:31:50,726 --> 00:31:56,496
one of his boats reports a catch
  of 1,850 pounds of scallops.  

516
00:31:56,498 --> 00:32:00,667
 But a check by NOAA of what is 
     really on board reveals    

517
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:05,288
        that the boat has       
        12,794 pounds --        

518
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:08,225
 over six times what he reports.

519
00:32:08,227 --> 00:32:15,182
     He gets caught, again,     
   and NOAA fines him $70,000.  

520
00:32:15,184 --> 00:32:17,601
  Rafael can afford that fine,  

521
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:19,486
      and so he is willing      
          to take risks         

522
00:32:19,488 --> 00:32:22,856
      that other fishermen      
      would not dare take.      

523
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:25,809
  Sykes: I'd be scared to death 
         that they'd...         

524
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:27,611
    He had a lot of permits,    

525
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:29,613
    so maybe he could afford    
       to lose one or two.      

526
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:31,198
          I've got one.         

527
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,533
         If I lose that,        
    a boat without permits --   

528
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:36,820
     not totally worthless,     
       but not worth much.      

529
00:32:36,822 --> 00:32:39,289
     Lelling: They're trying    
      to follow the rules.      

530
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:44,127
    They're trying to eke out   
a living with maybe three boats.

531
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:47,381
   Here you have Carlos Rafael  
         with 40 boats.         

532
00:32:47,383 --> 00:32:50,550
         He's cheating.         
     You know he's cheating.    

533
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:52,168
      And he's prospering.      

534
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:56,690
      You're not cheating,      
   and you're not prospering.   

535
00:32:56,692 --> 00:33:00,494
 Narrator: And there seems to be
      just one conclusion.      

536
00:33:00,496 --> 00:33:03,230
        He's untouchable.       
       He's The Codfather.      

537
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:10,821
 Narrator: Next, Rafael lures in
        co-conspirators.        

538

577
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:09,276
            Narrator:           
    For years, Carlos Rafael    

578
00:37:09,278 --> 00:37:12,095
     is a thorn in the side     
       of law enforcement.      

579
00:37:12,097 --> 00:37:14,314
     He has been prosecuted     
          three times,          

580
00:37:14,316 --> 00:37:16,149
      with two convictions.     

581
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:18,318
    And he has paid hundreds    
     of thousands of dollars    

582
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,321
 in fines for civil violations. 

583
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:23,773
        You can cite him        
    for doing this and that,    

584
00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:26,660
           and for him          
   it's like a parking ticket.  

585
00:37:26,662 --> 00:37:29,496
   Something more was needed.   

586
00:37:29,498 --> 00:37:33,283
    Narrator: And the chance    
     to do "something more"     

587
00:37:33,285 --> 00:37:35,985
     comes in January 2015,     

588
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:38,821
 when IRS agents see an article 
    in the New Bedford paper    

589
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:43,009
       saying that Rafael       
   wants to sell his business.  

590
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:48,848
     He tells the reporter,     
 "I'm gonna cash in and screw." 

591
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:52,218
     So, I saw that article     
          and thought,          

592
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:54,287
      "If he wants to sell      
          his business,         

593
00:37:54,289 --> 00:37:57,123
     maybe we're interested     
         in buying it."         

594
00:37:57,125 --> 00:38:03,863
Narrator: And so, IRS undercover
 agents place a call to Rafael. 

595
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:06,566
  They just picked up the phone 
    and called him and said,    

596
00:38:06,568 --> 00:38:08,034
     "We're a bunch of guys     
         from New York.         

597
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:09,736
      We're thinking about      
      buying your business.     

598
00:38:09,738 --> 00:38:11,571
  Would you sit down with us?"  

599
00:38:11,573 --> 00:38:17,494
 Narrator: Rafael takes the bait
and agrees to a meeting in June.

600
00:38:17,496 --> 00:38:21,381
   There are three undercover   
  agents working the operation. 

601
00:38:21,383 --> 00:38:24,551
     One is playing the part    
     of a financial broker.     

602
00:38:24,553 --> 00:38:27,053
 The other two are his clients, 

603
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:30,006
         who claim to be        
       Russian investors.       

604
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:33,259
 They meet Rafael at his office.

605
00:38:33,261 --> 00:38:36,696
     He wasn't anybody like     
       I ever met before.       

606
00:38:36,698 --> 00:38:39,165
  Narrator: Because the agents  
        work undercover,        

607
00:38:39,167 --> 00:38:42,669
         they asked that        
    their faces be concealed.   

608
00:38:42,671 --> 00:38:43,937
      Alex: If you give him     
         an opportunity,        

609
00:38:43,939 --> 00:38:46,172
    he'll talk about himself    
           constantly.          

610
00:38:46,174 --> 00:38:50,110
     Gary: Larger than life.    
       Very in your face.       

611
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:54,397
  Lots of vulgarity, swearing,  
       yelling, screaming.      

612
00:38:54,399 --> 00:38:57,951
      I didn't realize that     
   the "F" word could be used   

613
00:38:57,953 --> 00:39:02,389
 in so many ways in a sentence, 
       to be quite frank.       

614
00:39:02,391 --> 00:39:05,358
     Narrator: The Russians'    
   first question to Rafael --  

615
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,327
        What does he want       
        for his business?       

616
00:39:07,329 --> 00:39:12,432
   His answer -- $175 million.  

617
00:39:12,434 --> 00:39:15,918
            Lelling:            
  And they said to him, "Well,  
  we'd have to see your books." 

618
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,389
   So, when Carlos showed them  
      his legitimate books,     

619
00:39:19,391 --> 00:39:22,392
 it did not support that price. 

620
00:39:22,394 --> 00:39:24,644
      So they said to him,      

621
00:39:24,646 --> 00:39:30,066
      "Why would we pay you     
$175 million for this business?"

622
00:39:30,068 --> 00:39:32,435
            Narrator:           
  And to answer that question,  

623
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:34,738
he needs to reveal his scheme --

624
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:38,742
   how he gets around the law,  
   and keeps his profits high.  

625
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:57,627
     So that is his secret.     
       It's called lying.       

626
00:39:57,629 --> 00:39:59,629
      This is what he does.     

627
00:39:59,631 --> 00:40:02,515
      If a captain catches      
      3,000 pounds of cod,      

628
00:40:02,517 --> 00:40:05,769
    which is a fish for which   
   Rafael has a low allotment,  

629
00:40:05,771 --> 00:40:09,472
he calls the cod something else,
          like haddock,         

630
00:40:09,474 --> 00:40:12,609
        a fish for which        
    he has a huge allotment.    

631
00:40:20,485 --> 00:40:22,151
    It's just a simple matter   

632
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:26,489
 of falsifying official reports 
     that are sent to NOAA.     

633
00:40:26,491 --> 00:40:28,208
 Rafael tells the boat captains 

634
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:31,010
        how to lie about        
        what they catch.        

635
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:33,963
   He lies about what he buys.  

636
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:36,766
   Lelling: So, back at NOAA,   
   when they compare the two,   

637
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:40,804
  they don't detect any fraud,  
       because they match.      

638
00:40:40,806 --> 00:40:43,973
    Narrator: And so, Rafael    
   can catch whatever he wants  

639
00:40:43,975 --> 00:40:46,392
and not be limited by his quota,

640
00:40:46,394 --> 00:40:49,178
       what the government      
      allows him to catch.      

641
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,815
   When law-abiding fishermen   
          reach the end         

642
00:40:51,817 --> 00:40:54,317
    of their allowable share    
          of the catch,         

643
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,653
they are forced to stop fishing,

644
00:40:56,655 --> 00:41:01,491
     or they have the option    
       to buy more quota.       

645
00:41:01,493 --> 00:41:05,879
     They gave me, I think,     
 6,000 pounds of winter flounder

646
00:41:05,881 --> 00:41:10,884
       for the whole year,      
      which starts May 1st.     

647
00:41:10,886 --> 00:41:12,702
 So, I've already used that up. 

648
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:15,338
          So, in order          
      to stay in business,      

649
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:21,043
   I have to lease the rights   
     to catch more flounder     

650
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:24,714
     from another fisherman.    

651
00:41:24,716 --> 00:41:26,850
   Narrator: Honest fishermen,  
       like Rodman Sykes,       

652
00:41:26,852 --> 00:41:31,187
 are forced to pay for the right
       to catch more fish.      

653
00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:33,356
       Because he is lying      
       to the government,       

654
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:37,327
     Carlos Rafael does not     
       have that expense.       

655
00:41:51,126 --> 00:41:56,746
 And Rafael claims his captains 
profit from the scheme, as well,

656
00:41:56,748 --> 00:41:59,799
    because he requires them    
     to chip in on any quota    

657
00:41:59,801 --> 00:42:02,735
    that he is forced to buy.   

658
00:42:15,317 --> 00:42:19,402
   And later, when the scheme   
         is discovered,         

659
00:42:19,404 --> 00:42:24,157
  some people on the waterfront 
 understand a captain's choice. 

660
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:26,910
            Kendall:            
   I can tell you one thing --  

661
00:42:26,912 --> 00:42:31,998
       If you're a captain      
     of a fairly good vessel    

662
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,283
 that's making fairly good money

663
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:37,453
         at a time where        
    some of your compatriots    

664
00:42:37,455 --> 00:42:39,672
      are starving to death     
    or going out of business    

665
00:42:39,674 --> 00:42:41,624
     or losing their homes,     

666
00:42:41,626 --> 00:42:44,310
      you'll pretty much do     
   what the hell you're told.   

667
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:46,813
     And I don't want people    
    to think that, you know,    

668
00:42:46,815 --> 00:42:53,302
        I approved of it,       
  but I think I understand it.  

669
00:42:53,304 --> 00:42:55,488
   Narrator: By January 2016,   

670
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:58,658
  the IRS agents know they need 
        to get more proof       

671
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,827
       of Rafael's scheme.      

672
00:43:00,829 --> 00:43:05,281
   And at their last meeting,   
       he provides it all.      

673
00:43:05,283 --> 00:43:06,950
            Mullett:            
   He pulled out trip reports.  

674
00:43:06,952 --> 00:43:10,370
  He pulled out bills of lading 
      and dealer reports --     

675
00:43:10,372 --> 00:43:14,290
 all the documents that identify
     what was being caught,     

676
00:43:14,292 --> 00:43:19,996
   which boat was landing it,   
 and to whom it was being sold. 

677
00:43:19,998 --> 00:43:22,966
   Narrator: It's as if he is   
showing off a great achievement.

678
00:43:22,968 --> 00:43:25,301
   He is proud of his scheme.   

679
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:40,817
    Next on "American Greed,"   
 Rafael tries tax evasion again.

680
00:43:40,819 --> 00:43:42,518
     Gary: The bags of cash     
         were so heavy,         

681
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:45,905
  sometimes they would struggle 
     to actually carry them.

696
00:45:40,288 --> 00:45:41,871
     are you thinking about

697
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:43,372
   Well, I'm managing my A1C,

             Right.             

700
00:45:46,144 --> 00:45:47,310
 Actually, you're still at risk 

701
00:45:47,345 --> 00:45:48,728
    for a fatal heart attack    
           or stroke.

704

              Yep!              

705
00:45:53,268 --> 00:45:55,551
  That's why I asked my doctor  
    what else I could do...     

706
00:45:55,570 --> 00:45:57,270
  she told me about JARDIANCE.  

707

750
00:47:43,862 --> 00:47:47,179
            Narrator:           
   Anyone seeing Carlos Rafael  
  on the New Bedford Waterfront 

751
00:47:47,181 --> 00:47:52,118
 would not suspect that the man 
  is worth millions of dollars. 

752
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:55,204
 He drives an old pickup truck. 

753
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:58,257
   His house is a modest home   
       in nearby Dartmouth      

754
00:47:58,259 --> 00:48:01,460
     that he bought in 1980.    

755
00:48:01,462 --> 00:48:04,430
  And while he typically keeps  
   the details of his finances  

756
00:48:04,432 --> 00:48:06,098
       close to his chest,      

757
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:09,936
      in 2016, he is forced     
        to open his books       

758
00:48:09,938 --> 00:48:14,807
     to two Russians who say    
 they want to buy his business. 

759
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:16,609
      Alex: He was sitting      
         behind a desk,         

760
00:48:16,611 --> 00:48:19,228
         and, you know,         
  he reaches down in his drawer 

761
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:23,399
 and pulls out a piece of paper 
     with the cash payments.    

762
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:29,271
           Man: Okay.           

763
00:48:29,273 --> 00:48:33,743
    Narrator: It is a receipt   
    of sorts for $600,000 --    

764
00:48:33,745 --> 00:48:35,428
 money that he says he receives 

765
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:40,433
  from a wholesale fish dealer  
        in New York City.       

766
00:48:40,435 --> 00:48:43,903
      The dealer is not in      
       on Rafael's fraud.       

767
00:48:43,905 --> 00:48:47,106
     He simply buys his fish    
    from Rafael at a discount   

768
00:48:47,108 --> 00:48:51,677
   because he pays with cash,   
    hand delivered to Rafael.   

769
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:55,982
  He would meet Carlos halfway  
   between New York and Boston  

770
00:48:55,984 --> 00:48:59,301
    and give him a duffel bag   
  with cash in it for the fish. 

771
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:00,937
 The bags of cash were so heavy 

772
00:49:00,939 --> 00:49:03,823
    that sometimes they would   
struggle to actually carry them.

773
00:49:03,825 --> 00:49:05,858
            Narrator:           
      And the bags of cash      

774
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:09,028
        are deliberately        
       kept out of sight.       

775
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:10,963
         So, for Carlos,        

776
00:49:10,965 --> 00:49:14,667
       those cash payments      
   never made it on his books.  

777
00:49:14,669 --> 00:49:18,537
         So that became         
       unreported income.       

778
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:20,172
      Narrator: And that's      
      something of interest     

779
00:49:20,174 --> 00:49:22,775
        to the IRS agents       
        he is talking to.       

780
00:49:22,777 --> 00:49:26,545
     They ask, "What happens    
          to the cash?"         

781
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:28,848
      Mullett: Carlos said,     
      "I got it overseas."      

782
00:49:28,850 --> 00:49:30,800
        Well, wait, wait.       
    If you have it overseas,    

783
00:49:30,802 --> 00:49:32,802
 you have to fill out paperwork 
        and stuff, right?       

784
00:49:32,804 --> 00:49:36,338
    There's currency reports    
 that you fill out at an airport

785
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:38,391
      anytime you take more     
          than $10,000.         

786
00:49:38,393 --> 00:49:40,977
       What do you mean,        
       you're bringing it       
       out of the country?      

787
00:49:40,979 --> 00:49:46,649
 Narrator: Rafael says he has a 
friend with special credentials.

788
00:50:05,386 --> 00:50:07,319
That "agent" he is talking about

789
00:50:07,321 --> 00:50:09,188
           is a local           
     law-enforcement officer    

790
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:13,159
        breaking the law        
 and getting cash past security 

791
00:50:13,161 --> 00:50:15,544
   at Boston's Logan Airport.   

792
00:50:15,546 --> 00:50:17,513
          Gary: It was          
    a very big moment for us.   

793
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:20,516
     You have to understand,    
   that's where 9/11 started.   

794
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:22,685
   And now we're hearing about  
    a law-enforcement officer   

795
00:50:22,687 --> 00:50:26,939
   circumventing controls and   
 security at that same airport. 

796
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:32,528
    So, we, right away, were    
   very alarmed, very worried.  

797
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,030
    Narrator: The officer is    

798
00:50:34,032 --> 00:50:38,918
 Bristol County Sheriff's Deputy
        Antonio Freitas.        

799
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:42,088
  Rafael says Freitas owes him. 

800
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:52,048
          Shortly after         
    Rafael makes that claim,    

801
00:50:52,050 --> 00:51:00,039
Freitas is caught smuggling cash
 for his "friend" Carlos Rafael.

802
00:51:00,041 --> 00:51:02,775
    Mullett: So, Freitas was    
       ultimately indicted      

803
00:51:02,777 --> 00:51:06,746
         for conspiracy         
    and bulk-cash smuggling.    

804
00:51:06,748 --> 00:51:11,567
 So he was tried and convicted. 

805
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:16,122
    Narrator: He is sentenced   
      to a year in prison.      

806
00:51:16,124 --> 00:51:21,927
  The IRS undercover operation  
      ends in January 2016.     

807
00:51:21,929 --> 00:51:27,066
   The government feels it has  
 what it needs to move forward. 

808
00:51:27,068 --> 00:51:30,002
    As the agents say goodbye   
           to Rafael,           

809
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:31,971
        he thinks he has        
        sold his business       

810
00:51:31,973 --> 00:51:33,973
to a couple of Russian mobsters.

811
00:51:33,975 --> 00:51:37,777
  After all, he is untouchable. 

812
00:51:37,779 --> 00:51:40,346
    Gary: He would brag to us   
       over and over again      

813
00:51:40,348 --> 00:51:42,681
       how no one was ever      
        gonna catch him,        

814
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:45,417
    and how everyone had been   
       trying to catch him      

815
00:51:45,419 --> 00:51:47,353
 for years and years and years. 

816
00:51:47,355 --> 00:51:50,289
   And, you know, he knew that  
   he was tricking everybody.   

817
00:51:50,291 --> 00:51:55,161
  And, meanwhile, at that time, 
 he was the one getting tricked.

818
00:51:55,163 --> 00:52:00,699
            Narrator:           
   Next, the danger of goading  
     the federal government.    

819
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:03,936
    Carlos Rafael was quoted    
     in the press as saying,    

820
00:52:03,938 --> 00:52:08,340
         "I'm a pirate.

848
00:55:57,071 --> 00:55:58,937
      Narrator: For years,      

849
00:55:58,939 --> 00:56:01,573
       Carlos Rafael runs       
      a criminal operation,     

850
00:56:01,575 --> 00:56:04,143
        believing he will       
        never be caught.        

851
00:56:04,145 --> 00:56:07,780
      He confidently tells      
    the undercover agents...    

852
00:56:15,106 --> 00:56:16,472
           Man: Yeah.           

853
00:56:22,763 --> 00:56:26,098
            Narrator:           
    But on February 26, 2016,   

854
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:28,734
        more than a dozen       
federal law-enforcement officers

855
00:56:28,736 --> 00:56:31,203
     surround Carlos Seafood    

856
00:56:31,205 --> 00:56:35,357
         and move inside        
        to arrest Rafael.       

857
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:39,111
   Lelling: Carlos Rafael was   
 quoted in the press as saying, 

858
00:56:39,113 --> 00:56:42,881
         "I'm a pirate.         
   It's your job to catch me."  

859
00:56:42,883 --> 00:56:46,251
          I love that,          
     because that's perfect.    

860
00:56:46,253 --> 00:56:49,455
         We caught him.         

861
00:56:49,457 --> 00:56:51,290
    Narrator: After the raid    
      on Rafael's business,     

862
00:56:51,292 --> 00:56:53,709
          with hundreds         
     of his records seized,     

863
00:56:53,711 --> 00:56:55,911
      federal investigators     
         begin the work         

864
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:58,881
    of sorting out his lies.    

865
00:56:58,883 --> 00:57:01,717
   Fish by fish, boat by boat,  

866
00:57:01,719 --> 00:57:05,387
          sale by sale,         
   thousands of transactions.   

867
00:57:05,389 --> 00:57:07,389
      Narrator: In the end,     

868
00:57:07,391 --> 00:57:09,808
     the government comes up    
         with a figure.         

869
00:57:09,810 --> 00:57:12,761
         In four years,         
     Rafael illegally caught    

870
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:17,766
at least 782,000 pounds of fish.

871
00:57:17,768 --> 00:57:21,770
 Lelling: My first question was,
    "Is that a lot of fish?"    

872
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:25,073
 So we asked an analyst at NOAA.

873
00:57:25,075 --> 00:57:28,744
      And the analyst said,     
  "If forests were your thing,  

874
00:57:28,746 --> 00:57:32,548
       this would be like       
     burning down Vermont."     

875
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:36,168
         We said, "Okay,        
     that's a lot of fish."     

876
00:57:36,170 --> 00:57:40,973
 Narrator: And it's important to
 remember whose fish those are. 

877
00:57:40,975 --> 00:57:43,792
            Shelley:            
    You know, this is really    
   a crime against all of us,   

878
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:48,013
       because these fish       
    didn't belong to Carlos.    

879
00:57:48,015 --> 00:57:50,315
     He didn't spend a dime     
          raising them.         

880
00:57:50,317 --> 00:57:54,269
      He didn't feed them.      
 He just went out and took them.

881
00:57:54,271 --> 00:57:56,522
   And he took them illegally.  

882
00:57:56,524 --> 00:58:00,275
   And he took them, not just   
   from his fellow fishermen,   

883
00:58:00,277 --> 00:58:03,979
      he took them from us.     

884
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:06,365
    Narrator: In March 2017,    

885
00:58:06,367 --> 00:58:08,784
       faced with 15 hours      
    of undercover recordings    

886
00:58:08,786 --> 00:58:10,819
     made by the IRS agents,    

887
00:58:10,821 --> 00:58:13,622
      Rafael pleads guilty      
         to conspiracy,         

888
00:58:13,624 --> 00:58:15,457
   falsifying federal records,  

889
00:58:15,459 --> 00:58:20,012
      bulk-cash smuggling,      
        and tax evasion.        

890
00:58:20,014 --> 00:58:21,380
      Through his attorney,     

891
00:58:21,382 --> 00:58:23,448
           he declines          
   "American Greed's" request   

892
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:26,718
 to participate in this report. 

893
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,888
   At his sentencing hearing,   
       Rafael argues that,      

894
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:32,124
   in perpetrating his scheme,  

895
00:58:32,126 --> 00:58:35,894
 he was actually trying to help 
   fishermen in New Bedford --  

896
00:58:35,896 --> 00:58:38,197
 He wanted to keep them working.

897
00:58:38,199 --> 00:58:42,134
      He asks for 24 months     
   of "community confinement,"  

898
00:58:42,136 --> 00:58:45,904
     claiming that his crime    
     was stupid, not greedy.    

899
00:58:45,906 --> 00:58:49,341
  The judge disagrees, saying,  
      "This was not stupid.     

900
00:58:49,343 --> 00:58:51,176
       This was corrupt."       

901
00:58:51,178 --> 00:58:56,031
       He sentences Rafael      
     to 46 months in prison.    

902
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:59,718
I think he was convinced to give
  Carlos Rafael a high sentence 

903
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:04,923
       by the sheer extent      
 of the misconduct in this case 

904
00:59:04,925 --> 00:59:07,059
        and the fact that       
     he had been prosecuted     

905
00:59:07,061 --> 00:59:08,677
     three times in the past    

906
00:59:08,679 --> 00:59:12,931
       for crimes related       
    to his fishing business.    

907
00:59:12,933 --> 00:59:16,051
     So I think we were able    
   to convince the court that,  

908
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:19,938
 unless federal law-enforcement 
  was gonna be a complete joke, 

909
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:23,358
   it had to be the last time.  

910
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:26,028
                     ♪♪         

911
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:28,396
        Narrator: Rafael        
      is in federal prison,     

912
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,699
      but there is a worry      
   on New England waterfronts   

913
00:59:30,701 --> 00:59:33,118
      that his crimes have      
       hurt the reputation      

914
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:35,070
     of all fishermen here,     

915
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:39,174
     who essentially operate    
       in an honor system.      

916
00:59:39,176 --> 00:59:41,960
   Shelley: Carlos didn't care  
     about the honor system.    

917
00:59:41,962 --> 00:59:47,799
       In fact, he used it      
        to his advantage,       

918
00:59:47,801 --> 00:59:49,801
  and, really, in the process,  

919
00:59:49,803 --> 00:59:52,971
     dishonored every other     
      law-abiding fisherman     

920
00:59:52,973 --> 00:59:55,307
        out on the water.       

921
00:59:55,309 --> 00:59:58,043
       Narrator: And those      
      law-abiding fishermen     

922
00:59:58,045 --> 01:00:00,646
     believe that is unfair.    

923
01:00:00,648 --> 01:00:02,064
 They have a message for anyone 

924
01:00:02,066 --> 01:00:05,600
       who hears the story      
        of Carlos Rafael.       

925
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:09,488
 Sykes: I want them to know that
 the vast majority of fishermen 

926
01:00:09,490 --> 01:00:12,574
   in this port, New Bedford,   
 all up and down the East Coast,

927
01:00:12,576 --> 01:00:14,793
 are honest, hard-working guys. 

928
01:00:14,795 --> 01:00:17,729
     Very hard-working guys.    

929
01:00:17,731 --> 01:00:19,831
  Narrator: And while some want 
   to blame the system itself
