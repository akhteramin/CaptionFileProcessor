1
00:00:00,601 --> 00:00:01,600
 of it.                         

2
00:00:03,037 --> 00:00:04,403
           - She got            
      the parking tickets.      

3
00:00:04,472 --> 00:00:06,472
    She had a slight stroke.    

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,574
    We didn't know that she     
     was gonna be admitted.     

5
00:00:08,642 --> 00:00:09,975
        She's a fighter.        

6
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:12,611
        - I have a note,        
        Inspector Quinn,        

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,346
       from Ms. Yuridia.        

8
00:00:14,415 --> 00:00:16,148
        "I'm not guilty,        
    and I don't have money."    

9
00:00:16,217 --> 00:00:17,916
      - That gentleman had      
         the same note.         

10
00:00:17,985 --> 00:00:19,818
         That gentleman         
       had the same note.       

11
00:00:19,887 --> 00:00:21,720
     She had the same note.     

12
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:24,490
          (announcer)           
    - This is the courtroom     
     of Judge Frank Caprio,     

13
00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:27,092
     where people and cases     
    are met with compassion.    

14
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:29,127
   A different kind of judge.   

15
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:30,963
          A courtroom           
         like no other.         

16
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,465
This is "Caught in Providence." 

17
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:34,266
         (Judge Caprio)         
       - Yuridia Mesure.        

18
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:36,902
      - Good morning, sir.      

19
00:00:36,971 --> 00:00:38,036
         (Judge Caprio)         
        - Good morning.         

20
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:40,339
   Oh, you're charged with...   

21
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:41,640
        failing to yield        
        the right of way        

22
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:43,242
        in a crosswalk.         

23
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,277
        - Yeah, I think         
          I not guilty          

24
00:00:45,346 --> 00:00:48,981
         because I see          
      the-- the old woman       

25
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,951
     and I see her when she     
       wanna try to pass        

26
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,320
      but she is stopping,      
        she is stopping.        

27
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,089
            I think             
        she wanna pass.         

28
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:59,491
     That's why I'm going.      

29
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,394
         Not pulling--          
         and I'm sorry.         

30
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:03,895
   - I think you should plead   
          not guilty,           

31
00:01:03,964 --> 00:01:06,031
           come back            
       and have a trial.        

32
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,399
        Can you do that?        

33
00:01:07,468 --> 00:01:09,301
          - I-- when--          
          I come back?          

34
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,802
            - Yeah.             

35
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:12,437
          - I'm sorry,          
       I can't come back        

36
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:15,974
    because I-- I lose hour     
           in my job            

37
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:18,477
           for I had            
         to come here.          

38
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:20,345
          I lose hour           
           in my job.           

39
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:21,446
       - What do you do?        

40
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:23,582
         - I am a CNA.          

41
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,119
           C-A-- CNA.           

42
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:29,621
           CNA, yeah.           

43
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:32,424
 I take care to the old people  
       at home, you know,       

44
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:34,059
     and I had to go later.     

45
00:01:34,128 --> 00:01:36,294
    The people, they need me    
        in the morning.         

46
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:37,295
  - Do you have any children?   

47
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:38,363
           - Oh yes.            

48
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:40,465
         I have three--         
          three kids.           

49
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:42,534
       One is in college,       

50
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,736
           and I help           
        to the college,         

51
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:46,838
      and I pay the taxes,      
        I pay the house.        

52
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:47,839
          Everything.           

53
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:48,874
         It's not easy.         

54
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:54,312
       But I'm gonna try        
 doing the life the best I can. 

55
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:56,047
        - I have a note,        
        Inspector Quinn,        

56
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,782
       from Ms. Yuridia.        

57
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,088
           She, uh...           

58
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:04,623
           she failed           
        to come to court        

59
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:05,457
         and she got...         

60
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,261
      ... she was violated      

61
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:10,862
       and as her excuse        
        to come back in         

62
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:12,931
       she says, "Please.       

63
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,399
        I'm not guilty,         
    and I don't have money."    

64
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,104
  - Your Honor, that gentleman  
       had the same note.       

65
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:20,972
         That gentleman         
       had the same note.       

66
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,240
     She had the same note.     

67
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:26,978
   - You have the same note?    

68
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:29,347
        - Oh, every day         
     when I wake up, Judge,     

69
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:30,615
   I put it on top of my wall   

70
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:33,084
        so my daughters         
   and my wife can read that.   

71
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,686
        (all chuckling)         

72
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,223
       - That's everybody       
         in this time.          

73
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,290
           - Exactly.           

74
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:40,558
           (Yuridia)            
          - It's hard.          

75
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:43,294
  The food is very expensive,   
           the tax--            

76
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:46,164
    everything is expensive.    

77
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:48,166
         And the kids,          
       when they grow up,       

78
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:50,402
      they eat more food.       

79
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,370
         - Oh, the kids         
     are sending you broke.     

80
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:53,772
        They've got big         
        appetites, huh?         

81
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,206
        - Yeah, exactly.        

82
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:56,741
      And they not give me      
          food stamp,           

83
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,409
            they not            
        give me nothing.        

84
00:02:58,478 --> 00:02:59,544
      And I take nothing.       

85
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:00,612
           - Who does           
       the cooking, you?        

86
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,713
         - Yes, I cook.         

87
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:03,515
      I am a good cooking.      

88
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,150
       - What's the best        
        thing you make?         

89
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:08,119
 - Rice and beans and chicken.  

90
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,053
         - Rice, beans          
          and chicken.          

91
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,688
      - Yes, they like it.      

92
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:11,923
   - Inspector Quinn's mouth    
         is salivating.         

93
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:12,924
          Look at him.          

94
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:14,692
  (Inspector Quinn chuckling)   

95
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:16,227
      You like rice, beans      
 and chicken, Inspector Quinn?  

96
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,163
        - I have yet to         
        have it, Judge.         

97
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:19,097
         (Judge Caprio)         
          - I'm sure.           

98
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,298
  - Chicken I'm familiar with.  

99
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,366
         (Judge Caprio)         
          - I'm sure.           

100
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:22,734
         - And I start          
      to cook it when I--       

101
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:26,671
      I had nine years old      
    and I start to cook it.     

102
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,739
     - You started cooking      
            at nine?            

103
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:29,140
      - At nine years old.      

104
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,341
        - So you've been        
    cooking for five years?     

105
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,442
           - No, I...           

106
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,912
      (attendees laughing)      

107
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:37,248
        And a little kid        
     in my-- in my country.     

108
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,716
    (Judge Caprio chuckling)    

109
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:44,022
      - All right, you're       
   gonna pay $35 court cost.    

110
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,723
       - I pay right now,       
          no problem.           

111
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,858
       Thank you so much.       

112
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:49,961
         - Be careful.          

113
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,195
           (Yuridia)            
             - Yes.             

114
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:52,263
- When you get to intersections,
       if there's anybody       

115
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,732

  - Good morning, Your Honor.   

131
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:22,794
 - Mr. Lewis has been observed  
   speeding in a school zone    

132
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:24,662
          at 1:55 p.m.

  - Yes, if I may, Your Honor?  

135
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:33,104
       So I met Mr. Lewis       
    at Operation Stand Down     

136
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:35,106
      roughly a month ago,      

137
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:38,443
        and he explained        
      the situation to me.      

138
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:41,879
   Mr. Lewis served six years   
        in the Marines.         

139
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,047
    Directly following that,    

140
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,549
       he served one year       
          in the Army           

141
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,752
  and Operation Desert Storm,   

142
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:51,289
         and on the day         
            at hand,            

143
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:53,624
         Mr. Lewis was          
     actually heading to--      

144
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:56,260
    I'm sorry-- coming from     
        the VA hospital.        

145
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:57,695
         He had severe          
         pain his back          

146
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,330
     and was suffering from     
            a hernia            

147
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,566
       and they treat him       
     as well as they could      

148
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,836
        and they had put        
     a follow-up-date offer     

149
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:06,037
       for the treatment,       

150
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:07,171
      and on the way home       
           Mr. Lewis            

151
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,740
         passed through         
        the school zone         

152
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,642
     and that's where this      
       incident occurred.       

153
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:14,545
     In terms of the prior      
   court date that he missed,   

154
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:17,315
Mr. Lewis confused the follow-up
 appointment at the VA hospital 

155
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:18,549
      with the court date       

156
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:20,017
     given that, you know,      
         the incidences         

157
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:21,519
    were from the same day.     

158
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:23,154
        So, Your Honor,         
     with that being said,      

159
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:25,490
    you know, Mr. Lewis has     
      served our country,       

160
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:27,825
      and we ask you that,      

161
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:30,661
    with all that he's done,    
  that you dismiss this fine.   

162
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,564
    - All right, not with--     
     not withstanding that,     

163
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:37,401
          the motorist          
     is charged with doing      

164
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:41,606
  one mile over what the city   
        prosecutes for.         

165
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,508
       The city does not        
   prosecute if you're doing    

166
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:45,243
         11 miles over.         

167
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:47,979
   But there's-- the statute    
     provides that the city     

168
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:50,314
       has the discretion       

169
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:54,285
         to charge plus         
  or minus one mile per hour.   

170
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,686
            - I see.            

171
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:58,189
     - So I have routinely      
        dismissed cases         

172
00:05:58,258 --> 00:06:01,225
       where the motorist       
    was doing 11 miles over.    

173
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:02,560
  He was doing 12 miles over,   

174
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:05,563
       so the issue that        
  I have to resolve in my mind  

175
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:08,232
      is does his service       
         to the country         

176
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:12,403
           and his...           
      position currently,       

177
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,372
      does that justify me      
       giving him a break       

178
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,973
       for one mile over?       

179
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,276
  And based on your argument,   
      I find that it does,      

180
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:20,244
         so the matter          
       will be dismissed.       

181
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:21,846
      - Great, thank you,

       prepare for this?        

184
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:26,951
            - Uh...

198

   the vehicle occasionally?    

199

        - Good morning.         

233
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,389
      - This your lawyer?       
         - My husband.          

234
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,657
         (Judge Caprio)         
      - Oh, your husband.       

235
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:20,958
             Okay.              

236
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,528
     Uh, why don't you guys     
  get two separate mics, okay?  

237
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,096
     I know-- I know you're     
      a very close family       

238
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:26,764
         and you wanna          
  stay close together, right.   

239
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,901
    (Judge Caprio laughing)     

240
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:33,137
        All right, now,         
    I'm gonna take a guess.     

241
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:35,073
        You were driving        
          the vehicle.          

242
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:37,108
           - She was.           

243
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:38,943
       - Inspector Quinn,       
      I started off wrong.      

244
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:41,045
      (Kimberly laughing)       

245
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:43,982
   You-- you allow her to use   
   the vehicle occasionally?    

246
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,683
          - Sometimes.          

247
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:46,684
       - It's a pretty--        

248
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,152
       - When she's good.       

249
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:49,854
           - And I'm            
          always good.          

250
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,323
      - Pretty fancy SUV.       

251
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,293
           Let's see.           

252
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:57,428
      You're charged with       
  parking in a prohibited area  

253
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:58,763
        on Fifth Street.        

254
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,999
             - Yes.             

255
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:02,233
        My grandmother--        

256
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:04,102
      - I mean, I know why      
   you're here, incidentally.   

257
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,236
   - I don't know why either.   

258
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:06,371
         (Judge Caprio)         
   - I know why you're here.    

259
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,305
      You're here to pay,       
      you're here to pay.       

260
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:08,339
        - To pay, yeah.         

261
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:10,308
   - That's why you're here.    

262
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:12,477
        Who's gonna pay,        
          you or him?           

263
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:13,645
            - He is.            

264
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:14,746
         (Judge Caprio)         
            - He is.            

265
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:16,080
      - She does the crime      
       and I pay for it.        

266
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:17,849
      (Kimberly laughing)       

267
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:19,150
  - I swear, she's completely   
    relaxed, she don't care.    

268
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:21,586
        - Hey, that was         
        the arrangement.        

269
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:22,754
         (Judge Caprio)         
  - All right, what happened?   

270
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:25,223
     - That's the benefits      
       of being married.        

271
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,025
      - How many children       
          do you have?          

272
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:28,159
       - We have two now.       

273
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:29,527
            - Yeah.             

274
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:31,629
   Well, you're charged with    
  parking in a prohibited area  

275
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:32,831
        on Fifth Street.        

276
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:34,833
         That's up near         
        Miriam Hospital.        

277
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:36,167
       What do you wanna        
       tell me about it?        

278
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:39,204
   - Well, it was a-- it was    
   a very busy day that day.    

279
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:41,372
         I was actually         
      following my mother,      

280
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:43,374
because I didn't know how to get
       to the hospital--        

281
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:44,709
   - Oh, now you're throwing    
   your mother under the bus.   

282
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:45,977
           - I know.            

283
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:47,712
       I have to because        
         it's part of--         

284
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:49,748
       I don't understand       
      why I got the ticket      

285
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:50,749
      and nobody else did.      

286
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,016
          - All right.          

287
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:54,386
    - But my grandmother had    
been admitted the night before, 

288
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:56,554
     so I was going to help     
         my mother out.         

289
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:59,324
       So I followed her        
     into two parking lots.     

290
00:10:59,393 --> 00:11:00,725
  There was no place to park.   

291
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:02,727
         Valet was out          
         in the street.         

292
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:07,265
   So we parked on the street   
       I followed her to.       

293
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:08,767
        We parked there,        

294
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,069
   there was a delivery truck   
        in front of us,         

295
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:12,671
          we went in,           
      she asked the valet       

296
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:14,439
      if it was okay to be      
         parked there.          

297
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:15,874
      He said it was okay       

298
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:18,343
       as long as it was        
      less than two hours.      

299
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:21,212
     So I made sure it was      
      less than two hours,      

300
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:23,248
      but when I came out,      
        I had a ticket.         

301
00:11:23,317 --> 00:11:26,084
    Her car was still there,    
   she did not have a ticket.   

302
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,987
  - Well, I have a photograph   
          of the area           

303
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:30,922
 and a photograph of your car,  

304
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:34,359
    and there is a delivery     
  truck in front of you and--   

305
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:35,794
  - Yeah, I think it was only   
       within ten minutes       

306
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,429
       I got that ticket,       

307
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:39,264
     according to the stamp     
        that was on it,         

308
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:40,665
        the time stamp.         

309
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:43,735
- And next to the delivery truck
  is a pole with signs on it,   

310
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:46,771
         which are not          
   visible in the photograph.   

311
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,572
     So what do you think,      
        Inspector Quinn?        

312
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:51,309
    - Your Honor, the signs     
        on the pole say,        

313
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:52,677
      "No parking anytime.      

314
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:56,681
           Deliveries           
    between 8:00 and 4:00."     

315
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:01,286
       - Does it really?        

316
00:12:01,355 --> 00:12:03,355
  - Your Honor, there's no way  
   I could've read that sign.   

317
00:12:03,423 --> 00:12:06,124
      (Kimberly laughing)       

318
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:07,592
       The photo the city       
     provided, Your Honor,      

319
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:10,629
 does not allow me the ability  
 to read the times on the sign. 

320
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:11,763
            - Okay.             

321
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:16,001
   Okay, so you're following    
  your mother to the hospital   

322
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,970
  because your grandmother was  
    in the hospital, right?     

323
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:21,006
      You asked the valet,      
      "Where can I park?"       

324
00:12:21,075 --> 00:12:22,474
  He says, "Park over there."   

325
00:12:22,543 --> 00:12:24,276
        You said to him,        
        "Are you sure?"         

326
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:25,844
   He says, "Sure I'm sure"--   
         he don't care.         

327
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:26,912
            - Right.            

328
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,113
         (Judge Caprio)         
        - He don't care.        

329
00:12:28,182 --> 00:12:30,148
     He figures, I'm gonna      
     get rid of her, right?     

330
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:31,616
            I've got            
       other stuff to do.       

331
00:12:31,685 --> 00:12:32,484
    Park anywhere you want.     

332
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,487
       And then you drag        
    your husband into court.    

333
00:12:35,556 --> 00:12:36,521
            - Yeah.             

334
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,123
       He wanted to come.       

335
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:39,191
      - You guys get along      
          pretty good.          

336
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,425
    You're recently married?    

337
00:12:40,494 --> 00:12:41,426
             - No.              

338
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:42,494
           37 years.            

339
00:12:42,563 --> 00:12:43,662
          - How many?           
             - 37.              

340
00:12:43,731 --> 00:12:45,597
          - 37 years?           

341
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,199
      - I feel your pain.       

342
00:12:47,268 --> 00:12:48,233
          Same thing.           

343
00:12:48,302 --> 00:12:50,035
        - It's been good        
            so far.             

344
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:51,403
         (Judge Caprio)         
- I'm gonna ask you a question. 

345
00:12:51,472 --> 00:12:53,171
            - Okay.             

346
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,406
    - This is a family joke     

347
00:12:54,475 --> 00:12:56,842

          two choices.          

462
00:18:18,668 --> 00:18:20,101
        You can pay a...        

463
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:22,970
         you can plead          
          guilty today          

464
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,206
    and I'll impose a fine,     

465
00:18:25,275 --> 00:18:26,841
      or you can come back      
       and have a trial.        

466
00:18:29,713 --> 00:18:32,180
       Is there anything        
  you wanna tell me about it?   

467
00:18:32,248 --> 00:18:34,382
    - It was just a simple--    

468
00:18:34,451 --> 00:18:36,551
        we was drinking,        
          I got drunk,          

469
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,953
     and... I blacked out.      

470
00:18:39,022 --> 00:18:40,488
         Don't remember         
          much of it.           

471
00:18:40,557 --> 00:18:41,756
       - You blacked out?       

472
00:18:41,825 --> 00:18:44,192
    - Yeah, I don't remember    
the cops coming and stuff, so-- 

473
00:18:44,261 --> 00:18:45,159
         (Judge Caprio)         
        - But did you--         

474
00:18:45,228 --> 00:18:46,427
     - I was really drunk.      

475
00:18:46,496 --> 00:18:47,462
 - Did you speak to the police  
       when they came in?       

476
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:50,532
          - If I did,           
       I don't remember.        

477
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,133
    - Oh, you don't remember    
         what you said.         

478
00:18:52,202 --> 00:18:55,236
         'Cause there's         
    a police report on this     

479
00:18:55,305 --> 00:18:56,604
             and...             

480
00:18:56,673 --> 00:18:57,906
    (Judge Caprio laughing)     

481
00:18:57,974 --> 00:18:59,874
       I'm not gonna read       
       the police report.       

482
00:18:59,943 --> 00:19:01,543
             Okay.              

483
00:19:01,611 --> 00:19:04,779
  I'm sure you probably said,   
    "Listen, sir, I'm sorry.    

484
00:19:04,848 --> 00:19:07,215
  "You know, we're just having  
 some friends getting together, 

485
00:19:07,284 --> 00:19:09,918
    "and I realize, Officer,    
      you have a tough job      

486
00:19:09,987 --> 00:19:11,786
           and please           
      show us some mercy."      

487
00:19:11,855 --> 00:19:12,954
    I think-- I think that's    
         what you said          

488
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,623
 to the police officer, right?  

489
00:19:14,691 --> 00:19:15,891
          - I hope so.          

490
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:17,759
     - Something like that.     

491
00:19:17,828 --> 00:19:18,727
       What do you think,       
        Inspector Quinn?        

492
00:19:18,795 --> 00:19:19,961
     Is that what she said?     

493
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,530
   - If you had to read that    
    report, it sounds like--    

494
00:19:21,598 --> 00:19:22,831
         (Judge Caprio)         
- We're not reading the report. 

495
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,366
  We're not gonna-- we're not   
     gonna do that to her.      

496
00:19:24,434 --> 00:19:26,501
     - Your version of that     
report, I have yet to read that.

497
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:28,103
      - She comes across,       
       she's very honest,       

498
00:19:28,172 --> 00:19:29,771
       she said, "Listen,       
    I had too much to drink.    

499
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,840
      "I had some friends,      
         the cops came.         

500
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:33,742
       "Maybe I said some       
  stuff that was inappropriate  

501
00:19:33,811 --> 00:19:34,976
   but that's not really me."   

502
00:19:35,045 --> 00:19:36,378
            - Right.            

503
00:19:36,447 --> 00:19:37,546
         - Is that what         
       you wanted to say?       

504
00:19:37,614 --> 00:19:38,714
   - Perfect, it's on point.    

505
00:19:38,782 --> 00:19:39,715
          - All right.          

506
00:19:39,783 --> 00:19:40,749
 Now, that's what you wanted--  

507
00:19:40,818 --> 00:19:41,650
    now, what are you really    
           thinking?            

508
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,820
       - I was wondering        
      what I really said.       

509
00:19:44,888 --> 00:19:45,721
     (Bernadette laughing)      

510
00:19:47,491 --> 00:19:49,691
     - Well, there's a $500     
           fine here,           

511
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,927
      so how do you plead:      
     guilty or not guilty?      

512
00:19:55,099 --> 00:19:56,598
   - I would say guilty with    
        an explanation,         

513
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:57,833
    which I just gave, so--     

514
00:19:57,902 --> 00:19:59,601
            - Yeah.             

515
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:00,869
         I don't know,          
        Inspector Quinn.        

516
00:20:00,938 --> 00:20:02,071
  I think we have to fine her.  

517
00:20:04,442 --> 00:20:06,842
       But I just dropped       
       one of the zeros,        

518
00:20:06,911 --> 00:20:09,144
         so it's gonna          
         cost you $50.          

519
00:20:09,213 --> 00:20:10,412
          - Thank you.          

520
00:20:10,481 --> 00:20:11,680
            - And--             

521
00:20:11,749 --> 00:20:13,782
- I thought you dropped the zero
    after the decimal point.    

522
00:20:13,851 --> 00:20:15,284
      (attendees laughing)      

523
00:20:18,055 --> 00:20:20,022
       - Now, there were        
 13 people at the party, right? 

524
00:20:20,091 --> 00:20:21,056
            - Yeah.             

525
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,692
        We-- we was all         
        just having fun.        

526
00:20:23,761 --> 00:20:25,594
      It got out of hand,       
            I guess,            

527
00:20:25,663 --> 00:20:26,896
  'cause after a few drinks--   

528
00:20:26,964 --> 00:20:28,230
 - I think you better-- I think 
    you better call them up     

529
00:20:28,299 --> 00:20:29,398
        and tell them--         

530
00:20:29,467 --> 00:20:30,433
   - I'm gonna start charging   

531
00:20:30,501 --> 00:20:33,302
           $25 a head           
    or something from them.     

532
00:20:33,371 --> 00:20:34,637
   - It's a $50 fine, right,    

533
00:20:34,706 --> 00:20:37,373
        so call them up         
and tell them they owe $4 each. 

534
00:20:37,442 --> 00:20:39,175
  They all have to participate  
      in the fine, right?       

535
00:20:39,243 --> 00:20:40,176
             - Yes.             

536
00:20:40,244 --> 00:20:41,177
   - Okay, good luck to you.    

537
00:20:41,245 --> 00:20:42,078
          - Thank you.          

538
00:20:43,681 --> 00:20:45,081
   - When you come to court,    

539
00:20:45,149 --> 00:20:47,149
        you are required        
       to tell the truth,       

540
00:20:47,218 --> 00:20:48,651
  the whole truth, and nothing  
         but the truth.         

541
00:20:50,488 --> 00:20:53,456
       But nowhere do we        
    ask that you over share.    

542
00:20:53,525 --> 00:20:56,192
 - I was eight months pregnant  
       and I had to pee.        

543
00:20:56,261 --> 00:20:57,627
       - Yeah, I was over       
     my girlfriend's house.     

544
00:20:59,397 --> 00:21:01,864
     - And I just had my--      
         some surgery,          

545
00:21:01,933 --> 00:21:03,733
     my fingers amputated.      

546
00:21:03,802 --> 00:21:05,968
     - While we appreciated     
      Ms. Ortiz's honesty       

547
00:21:06,037 --> 00:21:09,138
     when she admitted that     
    she got blackout drunk,     

548
00:21:09,207 --> 00:21:12,842
   she could have simply said   
    that she was overserved;    

549
00:21:12,911 --> 00:21:16,179
 a phrase that I'm occasionally 
      required to employ.       

550
00:21:16,248 --> 00:21:18,314
        Hey, it happens.        

551
00:21:18,383 --> 00:21:20,016
        Happy birthday,         
          Bernadette,           

552
00:21:20,085 --> 00:21:21,484
         and next year          
       might I recommend        

553
00:21:21,553 --> 00:21:24,821
   water, wine, water, wine,    
      and you'll be fine.       

554
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,122
            Pro tip.            

555
00:21:26,191 --> 00:21:27,424
           No charge.           

556
00:22:08,766 --> 00:22:10,500

601
00:24:39,487 --> 00:24:41,687
     - Okay, you have five      
    different registrations.    

602
00:24:43,324 --> 00:24:45,290
   - Yeah, I got three cars.    

603
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:47,192

607
00:24:51,899 --> 00:24:53,032

608

609
00:24:54,135 --> 00:24:56,302
    - So they all registered

610
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,303

    the culprits were, so--     

612
00:24:59,574 --> 00:25:01,707

     drives the Chevrolet?

614
00:25:03,244 --> 00:25:04,744
     - How old is your son?     

615
00:25:04,812 --> 00:25:06,045
        - My son is 20.         

616
00:25:06,114 --> 00:25:07,913
   He's in college right now

617
00:25:07,982 --> 00:25:09,081

   - Yeah, he plays football.   

619
00:25:10,318 --> 00:25:11,617
    - Well, I can see where     
           he got his           

620
00:25:11,686 --> 00:25:13,619
        athletic ability

         - His mother.          

623
00:25:15,924 --> 00:25:17,857
            - Yeah.             

624
00:25:17,926 --> 00:25:19,859
          Yeah, I went          
       to Mount Pleasant.       

625
00:25:19,928 --> 00:25:21,727
        I graduated from

627
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:23,863
            - Yeah.             

628
00:25:23,932 --> 00:25:25,164
       - And did you play       
       sports after that?       

629
00:25:25,233 --> 00:25:26,866
      - Of course, at URI.      

630
00:25:26,935 --> 00:25:30,470
            That was            
        back in... '90.         

631
00:25:30,538 --> 00:25:31,637
    - I think you should've     
         stuck it out.          

632
00:25:31,706 --> 00:25:33,172
     You probably could've      
    played for the Patriots.    

633
00:25:33,241 --> 00:25:34,207
    Look at the size of you.    

634
00:25:34,275 --> 00:25:36,075
    - Ah, prob-- most like--    
        I think my son--        

635
00:25:36,144 --> 00:25:37,910
      my son, most likely.      

636
00:25:37,979 --> 00:25:40,480
- Okay, on the red-light ticket 
 we're gonna take a look at it. 

637
00:25:40,548 --> 00:25:41,781
            - Okay.             

638
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:43,149
      - This was at 10:41       
        in the evening.         

639
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,959
       - Now, did I have        
        a car like that?        

640
00:25:53,028 --> 00:25:54,194

641
00:25:54,262 --> 00:25:55,328
      - I came here to ask      
         the questions,         

642
00:25:55,397 --> 00:25:56,563
      not to answer them.       

643
00:25:56,631 --> 00:25:57,931
       - All right, yeah,       
Your Honor, yeah, just curious. 

644
00:26:00,035 --> 00:26:02,002
      - I'm gonna dismiss       
 the parking ticket overnight.  

645
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,637
    It's gonna cost you $85     
       for the red light.       

646
00:26:03,705 --> 00:26:05,272
            - Shh...

649
00:26:08,877 --> 00:26:09,843
             - Yes.             

650
00:26:09,912 --> 00:26:11,111
    Can I get a little time     
          to come back          

651
00:26:11,179 --> 00:26:12,779
      and bring the money       
    if I gotta pay, though?

        eight years ago         

664
00:27:55,085 --> 00:27:56,684
          when he was           
     running for governor.      

665
00:27:56,753 --> 00:27:58,887
       - See, what you're       
       supposed to do is,       

666
00:27:58,955 --> 00:28:00,488
   before I make a decision,    

667
00:28:00,557 --> 00:28:02,190
   you're supposed to really    
         butter me up.          

668
00:28:02,259 --> 00:28:03,925
        So before I made        
    a decision on that case,    

669
00:28:03,994 --> 00:28:05,427
    you're supposed to say,     
       "I met your son,"        

670
00:28:05,495 --> 00:28:07,929
         and then you--         
  whatever you wanna tell me.   

671
00:28:07,998 --> 00:28:09,431
 You know, "I can't stand him," 
     or "he's a good guy."      

672
00:28:09,499 --> 00:28:10,432
      Something like that.      

673
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,566
   - It was just a pleasure.    

674
00:28:11,635 --> 00:28:13,068
        - Thank you for         
       those compliments.       

675
00:28:13,136 --> 00:28:14,302
       Very nice of you.

             (man)              
       - Are you kidding?       

677
00:29:53,838 --> 00:29:55,805
    - After the cops came...    
     - (Judge Caprio) Yeah?     

678
00:29:55,807 --> 00:29:57,307
 - ...my brother got in a fight 
     with one of the cops.      

679
00:29:57,309 --> 00:29:59,959
             - Ohh!             
      - Hence the ticket.
