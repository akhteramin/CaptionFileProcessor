725
00:19:26,139 --> 00:19:28,340
       I'm mildly obsessed      
         with numbers.          

726
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:31,309
       So, I started with       
     the stats regarding my     

727
00:19:31,311 --> 00:19:33,645
       moderate to severe       
       plaque psoriasis.        

728
00:19:33,647 --> 00:19:35,047
         Like how HUMIRA        
       has been prescribed      

729
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:37,549
    to over 300,000 patients.   

730
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:40,118
   And how many patients saw    
   clear or almost clear skin   

731
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,620
       in just 4 months -       

732
00:19:41,622 --> 00:19:43,789
      the kind of clearance     
         that can last.         

733
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,824
       HUMIRA targets and       
   blocks a specific source of  

734
00:19:45,826 --> 00:19:48,393
       inflammation that        
    contributes to symptoms.    

735
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:49,862
       Numbers are great.       

736
00:19:49,864 --> 00:19:51,563
     And seeing clearer skin    

737
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,265
     is pretty awesome, too.
