00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,612
      what matters to you?      

641
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:10,251
           Let's see.           
   Most of you say lower A1C.   

642
00:16:10,253 --> 00:16:11,719
     But only a few of you      

643
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,787
 are thinking about your heart. 

644
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:16,757
    Fact is, even though        
    it helps to manage A1C,     

645
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:19,693
     type 2 diabetes still      
     increases your risk        

646
00:16:19,695 --> 00:16:21,362
       of a fatal heart         
       attack or stroke.        

647
00:16:21,364 --> 00:16:24,365

00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,136

  diabetes and heart disease,   

650
00:16:29,138 --> 00:16:31,538
   JARDIANCE significantly      
   reduces the risk of dying    

651
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,140
  from a cardiovascular event   

652
00:16:33,142 --> 00:16:35,442
        and lowers A1C,         
    with diet and exercise.

 Isn't it time to rethink your

679
00:17:25,828 --> 00:17:27,428
Ask your doctor about JARDIANCE 

680

      and get to the heart      
      of what matters.          

681

     I work hard to protect

00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:24,170
       starts with looking

923
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:25,538

      or no sugar at all.       

1051
00:29:26,214 --> 00:29:28,481
     Smaller portion sizes,

00:29:29,584 --> 00:29:34,220
    clear calorie labels and    
  reminders to think balance.   

1053
00:29:34,255 --> 00:29:36,355
Because we know mom wants what's
             best.              

1054
