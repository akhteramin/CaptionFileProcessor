  Imagine what you can do with  
  more migraine-free days.      

450
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,746
            (Pirate)

00:17:37,085 --> 00:17:38,651
    (Announcer)                 
    When you're not fighting    
    through migraine            

453
00:17:38,753 --> 00:17:40,586
   imagine the possibilities.   

454
00:17:40,688 --> 00:17:43,656
 Once-monthly Emgality is used  
 for the prevention             

455
00:17:43,691 --> 00:17:44,924
     of migraine in adults.     

456
00:17:45,026 --> 00:17:47,059
 It's specifically developed to 
 help give you                  

457
00:17:47,095 --> 00:17:48,694
    more migraine-free days.    

458
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:52,164
 With Emgality about 60% of     
 people had their migraine days 

459
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,432
      cut in half or more.      

460
00:17:53,534 --> 00:17:56,368
Do not use if you are allergic  
to Emgality or its ingredients. 

461
00:17:57,605 --> 00:17:59,638
  Emgality may cause allergic   
  reactions, such as            

462
00:17:59,674 --> 00:18:01,740
    itching, rash, hives and    
    trouble breathing,          

463
00:18:01,776 --> 00:18:03,275
which can happen days after use.

464
00:18:03,577 --> 00:18:05,310
Call your doctor or get medical 
help right away                 

465
00:18:05,346 --> 00:18:07,279
   if you have symptoms of an   
   allergic reaction.           

466
00:18:07,314 --> 00:18:08,647
      The most common side      
      effects include           

467
00:18:08,682 --> 00:18:10,082
   injection site reactions.    

468
00:18:10,184 --> 00:18:11,350

1543
00:55:02,025 --> 00:55:04,792

Yeah honey, how about we play...

1549

     princess and pirates?      

1550
00:55:16,906 --> 00:55:19,807
  (Announcer)                   
  Imagine what you can do with  
  more migraine-free days.      

1551
00:55:24,647 --> 00:55:25,813
            (Pirate)            
            Arr!                

1552

           (Mom)                
           En garde!            

1553
00:55:29,151 --> 00:55:30,718
    (Announcer)                 
    When you're not fighting    
    through migraine            

1554
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:32,653
   imagine the possibilities.   

1555
00:55:32,755 --> 00:55:35,722
 Once-monthly Emgality is used  
 for the prevention             

1556
00:55:35,758 --> 00:55:36,990
     of migraine in adults.     

1557
00:55:37,092 --> 00:55:39,126
 It's specifically developed to 
 help give you                  

1558
00:55:39,161 --> 00:55:40,761
    more migraine-free days.    

1559
00:55:40,996 --> 00:55:44,231
 With Emgality about 60% of     
 people had their migraine days 

1560
00:55:44,266 --> 00:55:45,499
      cut in half or more.      

1561
00:55:45,601 --> 00:55:48,435
Do not use if you are allergic  
to Emgality or its ingredients. 

1562
00:55:49,672 --> 00:55:51,705
  Emgality may cause allergic   
  reactions, such as            

1563
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:53,807
    itching, rash, hives and    
    trouble breathing,          

1564
00:55:53,842 --> 00:55:55,342
which can happen days after use.

1565
00:55:55,644 --> 00:55:57,377
Call your doctor or get medical 
help right away                 

1566
00:55:57,412 --> 00:55:59,346
   if you have symptoms of an   
   allergic reaction.           

1567
00:55:59,381 --> 00:56:00,714
      The most common side      
      effects include           

1568
00:56:00,749 --> 00:56:02,148
   injection site reactions.    

1569
00:56:02,251 --> 00:56:03,416

  What should we do tomorrow?   

1570
00:56:03,685 --> 00:56:05,285
(Announcer)
