1
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:13,111
        I'm Craig Melvin.       

2
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:13,845
    And I'm Natalie Morales.    

3
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,915
     And this is "Dateline."    

4
00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:21,620
ragedy on                       
     top of a tragedy now.      

5
00:00:21,622 --> 00:00:23,722
   CRAIG MELVIN (VOICEOVER):    
    It happened so quickly.     

6
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:25,891
        Their parents in        
       the backyard spa.        

7
00:00:25,893 --> 00:00:27,526
     Their mom in trouble.      

8
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:30,996
      My dad just panicked.     

9
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:33,632
  CRAIG MELVIN (VOICEOVER): A   
   sudden slip, a fatal fall.   

10
00:00:33,634 --> 00:00:35,000
     KEITH MORRISON: You're     
      losing your mother.       

11
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:36,501
             Right.             

12
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:37,569
KEITH MORRISON: You're watching 
 her go right in front of you.  

13
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:38,436
          CRAIG MELVIN          
      (VOICEOVER): Someone      

14
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:39,170
  else was watching her too--   

15
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:41,840
      a curious neighbor.       

16
00:00:41,842 --> 00:00:43,074
LINDSAY PATTERSON: It was scary.

17
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:47,212
    The look on his face was    
     almost undescribable.      

18
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,147
   CRAIG MELVIN (VOICEOVER):    
       What had she seen?       

19
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:51,282
       Was this drowning        
      really an accident?       

20
00:00:57,757 --> 00:00:59,290
   CRAIG MELVIN (VOICEOVER):    
      A husband and father      

21
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:00,792
 are suddenly under suspicion.  

22
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:03,394
        And he's crying,        
       and we're crying.        

23
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:06,297
He said, they think I hurt mom. 

24
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,466
CRAIG MELVIN (VOICEOVER): Three 
 daughters stand by their dad.  

25
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:11,502
And one prosecutor stands firm. 

26
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:14,138
      He's holding his wife     
    of almost three decades     

27
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,339
        under the water.        

28
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:18,109
      And my job is to get      
    justice for Cristi Hall.    

29
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:19,443
   CRAIG MELVIN (VOICEOVER):    
         Was it murder?         

30
00:01:19,445 --> 00:01:22,746
         [theme music]          

31
00:01:29,655 --> 00:01:31,922
       Hello, and welcome       
         to "Dateline."         

32
00:01:31,924 --> 00:01:34,558
      A young woman peers       
    into her neighbor's yard    

33
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,195
    and sees something for a    
    few mysterious seconds--    

34
00:01:38,197 --> 00:01:41,899
     a man, a woman, and a      
   moment that's unsettling.    

35
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:45,135
        What she saw and        
       what she did would       

36
00:01:45,137 --> 00:01:47,070
     set in motion a chain      
      of events that would      

37
00:01:47,072 --> 00:01:50,240
  divide a family and a jury.   

38
00:01:50,242 --> 00:01:53,210
     Here's Keith Morrison.     

39
00:01:53,212 --> 00:01:55,979
    We know the truth and we    
 know everything that happened. 

40
00:01:55,981 --> 00:01:57,848
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
  How do we know what we know?  

41
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:01,151
  It's emotionally unsatisfying 
    not to have that answer.    

42
00:02:01,153 --> 00:02:02,486
         KEITH MORRISON         
       (VOICEOVER): So it       

43
00:02:02,488 --> 00:02:08,224
is, even if we've seen something
    or if we think. we have.    

44
00:02:08,226 --> 00:02:12,128
   And that's the question at   
 the heart of the whole puzzle. 

45
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,531
      Is this woman right?      

46
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:15,865
       LINDSAY PATTERSON:       
       I know what I saw.       

47
00:02:15,867 --> 00:02:18,735
         And I know the         
    conclusion of my story.     

48
00:02:18,737 --> 00:02:20,303
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
      Of course she does.       

49
00:02:20,305 --> 00:02:21,838
      Of course she does.       

50
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,308
     So why does this other     
       woman think this?        

51
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,644
       She didn't know for      
       sure what she saw.       

52
00:02:27,646 --> 00:02:29,278
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
     The question, we say,      

53
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,049
on which all the rest will turn.

54
00:02:33,051 --> 00:02:34,951
    Why don't we begin here?    

55
00:02:34,953 --> 00:02:38,454
    Calla Mesa, California,     
       Riverside County.        

56
00:02:38,456 --> 00:02:42,091
  Historic missions, sprawling  
      suburbs creeping out      

57
00:02:42,093 --> 00:02:45,027
    to the rim of mountains     
    around the eastern flank    

58
00:02:45,029 --> 00:02:46,963
        of Los Angeles.         

59
00:02:46,965 --> 00:02:49,699
 Here is where Chris and Cristi 
   Hall had come to live out    

60
00:02:49,701 --> 00:02:53,202
   their golden years, though   
     they were far from old     

61
00:02:53,204 --> 00:02:54,437
       when it happened.        

62
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:57,840
     Just experienced with      
      life and each other.      

63
00:02:57,842 --> 00:02:59,241
        As far back as I        
       can remember, it's       

64
00:02:59,243 --> 00:03:01,076
 always been Chris and Cristi.  

65
00:03:01,078 --> 00:03:05,681
        They were never         
    thought of as separate.     

66
00:03:05,683 --> 00:03:07,182
   They're-- they're a unit.    

67
00:03:07,184 --> 00:03:08,917
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
 These are the three daughters, 

68
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:11,787
 Courtney, Briana, and Ashtin.  

69
00:03:11,789 --> 00:03:15,124
  And all of them, of course,   
   have heard scores of times   

70
00:03:15,126 --> 00:03:18,660
        the story of how        
       their parents met.       

71
00:03:18,662 --> 00:03:20,128
          It was 1978.          

72
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,197
    Cristi had gone to see a    
   relative at the Air Force    

73
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:24,466
       base in nearby San       
     Bernardino and, quite      

74
00:03:24,468 --> 00:03:26,868
      by chance, while she      
     was there, encountered     

75
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,670
     a security guard who--     

76
00:03:28,672 --> 00:03:30,105
       to her, at least--       

77
00:03:30,107 --> 00:03:31,873
    looked just like Elvis.     

78
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,176
It was Blair Christopher Hall-- 

79
00:03:34,178 --> 00:03:35,510
     Chris to his friends.      

80
00:03:35,512 --> 00:03:37,412
      Apparently, she was a     
   little flirty at the gate.   

81
00:03:37,414 --> 00:03:38,280
          [chuckling]           

82
00:03:39,483 --> 00:03:40,382
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
        In short order,         

83
00:03:40,384 --> 00:03:42,317
 Chris and Cristi got married.  

84
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,418
          She was 17.           

85
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,220
            He, 20.             

86
00:03:45,222 --> 00:03:47,088
        And as the girls        
       grew up, they said       

87
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,990
       they never doubted       
      for a single moment       

88
00:03:48,992 --> 00:03:51,092
  the powerful bond of love--   

89
00:03:51,094 --> 00:03:54,062
    their parents with them     
      and with each other.      

90
00:03:54,064 --> 00:03:56,030
      I'd venture to say we     
   were probably closer with    

91
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:59,300
our parents than most children. 

92
00:03:59,302 --> 00:04:03,204
   They were the parents that   
     I hoped to one day be.     

93
00:04:03,206 --> 00:04:05,039
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
   Cristi, the vivacious glue   

94
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:05,940
         of the family.         

95
00:04:05,942 --> 00:04:07,708
   Chris, her perfect mirror.   

96
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,876
        ASHTIN HALL: My         
      dad's a little more       

97
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:11,279
  kick back, relax, and quiet.  

98
00:04:11,281 --> 00:04:13,414
    But they were a perfect     
       balance, I think.        

99
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:14,782
              Yes.              

100
00:04:14,784 --> 00:04:16,350
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
     For years, Chris Hall      

101
00:04:16,352 --> 00:04:17,818
      was a police officer      
       in San Bernardino,       

102
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,721
       until he was shot        
      in the line of duty.      

103
00:04:20,723 --> 00:04:22,323
      And then he went off      
     to become police chief     

104
00:04:22,325 --> 00:04:24,859
  in two small towns in Idaho.  

105
00:04:24,861 --> 00:04:28,529
         Then, in 2005,         
   anticipating an empty nest   

106
00:04:28,531 --> 00:04:30,164
          and eventual          
     retirement, the Halls      

107
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:33,367
   bought this place back in    
  Calla Mesa, which they loved  

108
00:04:33,369 --> 00:04:35,970
 for its backyard pool and spa. 

109
00:04:35,972 --> 00:04:38,439
        And life in the         
     spring of 2007 seemed      

110
00:04:38,441 --> 00:04:41,608
  to have hit a sweet spot, as  
   Ashtin and Briana remember   

111
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,243
   their mother telling them.   

112
00:04:43,245 --> 00:04:45,813
  BRIANA HALL: We happened to   
 be laying on the bed with her. 

113
00:04:45,815 --> 00:04:48,282
   She just started talking.    

114
00:04:48,284 --> 00:04:50,417
   She was like, I am just--    

115
00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:53,086
      I'm so happy that I       
    have you girls and dad.     

116
00:04:53,088 --> 00:04:54,888
   It was kind of one of those  
    conversations that you--    

117
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:55,989
        BRIANA HALL: It         
       was kind of rare.        

118
00:04:55,991 --> 00:04:57,157
        --that you don't        
        have every day.         

119
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:58,291
         KEITH MORRISON         
      (VOICEOVER): Still,       

120
00:04:58,293 --> 00:04:59,593
   there was work to be done.   

121
00:04:59,595 --> 00:05:02,462
    It was not a new house;     
   could use some remodeling,   

122
00:05:02,464 --> 00:05:04,798
   particularly the bathroom.   

123
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,901
 Courtney was still living with 
 her parents as the work began. 

124
00:05:07,903 --> 00:05:09,736
        --that they were        
    going to be doing the--     

125
00:05:09,738 --> 00:05:10,537
     KEITH MORRISON: Right.     

126
00:05:10,539 --> 00:05:12,038
      --tilework and stuff.     

127
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,175
     So we wouldn't have a      
      shower for that day.      

128
00:05:15,177 --> 00:05:17,077
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
 So, shower out of commission,  

129
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:19,546
 they decided to wake up early, 
  put on their bathing suits,   

130
00:05:19,548 --> 00:05:22,649
  and rinse off in the outdoor  
   spa before the contractor    

131
00:05:22,651 --> 00:05:25,285
      arrived at 6:45 AM.       

132
00:05:25,287 --> 00:05:27,987
      It was June 7, 2007.      

133
00:05:27,989 --> 00:05:30,556
   Chris got up first, turned   
   on the spa to warm it up,    

134
00:05:30,558 --> 00:05:34,460
 and then called Briana at her  
   college dorm in San Diego.   

135
00:05:34,462 --> 00:05:36,629
           Here's your          
      wake-up call, babe.       

136
00:05:36,631 --> 00:05:38,264
  Get out and go on that run.   

137
00:05:38,266 --> 00:05:39,465
        KEITH MORRISON:         
       Back at the house,       

138
00:05:39,467 --> 00:05:41,968
     Courtney dozed through     
       her first wake-up,       

139
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:45,371
  while Chris and Cristi made   
 their way outside to the spa.  

140
00:05:45,373 --> 00:05:48,207
     Just after 6:30, Chris     
  looked in on Courtney again,  

141
00:05:48,209 --> 00:05:51,010
       second call, then        
    headed back to the spa.     

142
00:05:51,012 --> 00:05:53,279
  Life's last normal moments.   

143
00:05:53,281 --> 00:05:54,947
            6:37 AM.            

144
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:56,982
      I got up out of bed.      

145
00:05:56,984 --> 00:05:58,350
       And I was putting        
       on my robe, and I        

146
00:05:58,352 --> 00:06:02,922
   just heard this panicked--   

147
00:06:02,924 --> 00:06:05,557
   just panicked scream from    
     my dad yelling for me.     

148
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:08,427
    You know, I ran down the    
   hallway to the back porch.   

149
00:06:08,429 --> 00:06:10,396
        And I saw him--         

150
00:06:10,398 --> 00:06:11,630
            [sighs]             

151
00:06:11,632 --> 00:06:14,566
    --just trying to pull up    
     my mom out of the spa.     

152
00:06:14,568 --> 00:06:16,502
  FEMALE OPERATOR (ON PHONE):   
 Fire Department and Emergency. 

153
00:06:16,504 --> 00:06:18,203
   COURTNEY HALL (ON PHONE):    
   [inaudible] an ambulance.    

154
00:06:18,205 --> 00:06:20,239
 KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): It 
 was she who dialed 911 as she  

155
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:22,841
  and her father struggled to   
lift her mother out of the spot.

156
00:06:22,843 --> 00:06:26,411
   It was the first moments of  
  the worst day of our lives.   

157
00:06:26,413 --> 00:06:28,347
    Is it possible for people   
    to understand what it's     

158
00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:29,614
 like to be in that situation?  

159
00:06:29,616 --> 00:06:31,049
        I don't think so.       

160
00:06:31,051 --> 00:06:38,523
  It's-- to see just both your  
   parents in the worst times   

161
00:06:38,525 --> 00:06:40,225
  that you've ever seen them.   

162
00:06:40,227 --> 00:06:45,263
 Obviously, my mom unconscious, 
   and my dad just panicked.    

163
00:06:45,265 --> 00:06:50,769
  And for the first time in my  
life, seeing him just that way, 

164
00:06:50,771 --> 00:06:52,036
    not knowing what to do.     

165
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:54,205
      Because he was a cop,     
     he was used to dealing     

166
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,640
  with those kinds of things.   

167
00:06:55,642 --> 00:06:56,975
          He was a cop.         

168
00:06:56,977 --> 00:06:58,276
   He's used to dealing with    
     those kinds of things      

169
00:06:58,278 --> 00:07:00,745
        with people that        
       were not his wife.       

170
00:07:00,747 --> 00:07:02,981
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
    So Courtney took charge.    

171
00:07:02,983 --> 00:07:05,950
     After calling 911, she     
   started CPR on her mother    

172
00:07:05,952 --> 00:07:07,418
        with her father.        

173
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,855
EMT and firefighter Eric Norwood
   was the first to respond.    

174
00:07:10,857 --> 00:07:12,390
        He just started--       

175
00:07:12,392 --> 00:07:13,257
         help my wife.          

176
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:14,225
    Oh my god, help my wife.    

177
00:07:14,227 --> 00:07:15,660
         Help my wife.          

178
00:07:15,662 --> 00:07:17,161
         KEITH MORRISON         
    (VOICEOVER): Chris Hall     

179
00:07:17,163 --> 00:07:19,764
was kneeling at his wife's side,
 more in the way than anything, 

180
00:07:19,766 --> 00:07:22,400
    and so hysterical it was    
   hard for the EMTs to help.   

181
00:07:22,402 --> 00:07:24,035
   ERIC NORWOOD (VOICEOVER):    
    It took us a little bit     

182
00:07:24,037 --> 00:07:24,935
   to get him out of the way.   

183
00:07:24,937 --> 00:07:26,771
  He didn't want to leave her.  

184
00:07:26,773 --> 00:07:29,473
    He was just holding her     
    hand, yelling her name.     

185
00:07:29,475 --> 00:07:31,442
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
The paramedics worked on Cristi 

186
00:07:31,444 --> 00:07:32,910
   for more than 20 minutes.    

187
00:07:32,912 --> 00:07:34,478
        No vital signs.         

188
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,546
             None.              

189
00:07:35,548 --> 00:07:38,449
       And-- and no words       
        to describe just        

190
00:07:38,451 --> 00:07:39,883
the-- the fear and the anxiety. 

191
00:07:39,885 --> 00:07:41,585
   You're losing your mother.   

192
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:42,886
             Right.             

193
00:07:42,888 --> 00:07:44,288
     And you're watching her    
   go right in front of you.    

194
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:47,491
      We tried to save her      
 together and we just couldn't. 

195
00:07:47,493 --> 00:07:48,959
         KEITH MORRISON         
   (VOICEOVER): The ambulance   

196
00:07:48,961 --> 00:07:52,596
rushed her off to the hospital, 
  where she was declared dead.  

197
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:55,565
        She had drowned         
       in the family spa.       

198
00:07:55,567 --> 00:08:02,539
A private family tragedy, except
maybe not so private after all. 

199
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:06,243
     Someone was watching.      

200
00:08:06,245 --> 00:08:07,711
   CRAIG MELVIN (VOICEOVER):    
       "Dateline" returns       

201
00:08:07,713 --> 00:08:08,411
        after the break.        

202
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:19,599
 KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): On 
  the morning of June 7, 2007,  

203
00:11:19,601 --> 00:11:21,801
     Briana Hall was on the     
      road from San Diego,      

204
00:11:21,803 --> 00:11:23,303
   driving home from college.   

205
00:11:23,305 --> 00:11:26,039
   To what, she didn't know,    
     except that her elder      

206
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,875
     sister, Courtney, had      
   called and it sounded bad.   

207
00:11:28,877 --> 00:11:30,877
         She said there         
        was an accident.        

208
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:33,446
     You need to just, you      
  know, come home right away.   

209
00:11:33,448 --> 00:11:34,981
         KEITH MORRISON         
      (VOICEOVER): It was       

210
00:11:34,983 --> 00:11:38,317
 Courtney who eventually broke  
 the news to Ashtin and Briana. 

211
00:11:38,319 --> 00:11:41,454
  Their mother, their father's  
   wife of close to 30 years,   

212
00:11:41,456 --> 00:11:42,855
           was dead.            

213
00:11:42,857 --> 00:11:45,391
    But neither Courtney nor    
   Chris waited at the house    

214
00:11:45,393 --> 00:11:48,361
    to tell the sisters what    
  happened or to comfort them,  

215
00:11:48,363 --> 00:11:52,098
    nor did they linger over    
   the body at the hospital.    

216
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,801
 They couldn't, because father  
   and daughter were escorted   

217
00:11:55,803 --> 00:11:59,572
   to separate squad cars and   
  driven to the police station  

218
00:11:59,574 --> 00:12:01,173
  to talk about the accident.   

219
00:12:01,175 --> 00:12:03,209
    What was that ride like?    

220
00:12:03,211 --> 00:12:05,211
        Quiet, you know?        

221
00:12:05,213 --> 00:12:07,146
        I just remember         
     crying the whole time.     

222
00:12:07,148 --> 00:12:08,214
 I couldn't comfort my father.  

223
00:12:08,216 --> 00:12:09,281
    He couldn't comfort me.     

224
00:12:09,283 --> 00:12:11,350
        He was-- when we        
      got to the station--      

225
00:12:11,352 --> 00:12:14,086
and they said that my dad would 
  just be a few more minutes.   

226
00:12:14,088 --> 00:12:15,387
         KEITH MORRISON         
      (VOICEOVER): Chris,       

227
00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:18,590
   so frenzied at the scene,    
    had calmed down by then.    

228
00:12:18,592 --> 00:12:20,959
       He was a cop among       
        cops, after all.        

229
00:12:20,961 --> 00:12:24,129
  And he understood, he said,   
   what was necessary to help   

230
00:12:24,131 --> 00:12:25,330
  them sort out what happened.  

231
00:12:35,442 --> 00:12:37,142
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
    Happy to help, he said.     

232
00:12:37,144 --> 00:12:39,678
  Whatever would get him back   
 home to comfort his daughters  

233
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,378
    as quickly as possible.     

234
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:49,854
         KEITH MORRISON         
    (VOICEOVER): Chris told     

235
00:12:49,856 --> 00:12:51,423
  investigators what happened.  

236
00:12:51,425 --> 00:12:53,591
        How as Courtney         
      slept, he and Cristi      

237
00:12:53,593 --> 00:12:55,160
   were in the spa, bathing.    

238
00:13:07,107 --> 00:13:09,040
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
 As Cristi returned to the spa, 

239
00:13:09,042 --> 00:13:11,743
    said Chris, they passed     
    each other on the patio.    

240
00:13:11,745 --> 00:13:13,311
     He went in the house,      
     then, he said, stopped     

241
00:13:13,313 --> 00:13:15,580
     by Courtney's room to      
    make sure she was awake,    

242
00:13:15,582 --> 00:13:17,615
 then went right back outside-- 

243
00:13:17,617 --> 00:13:21,085
   and saw his wife floating    
     face down in the spa.      

244
00:13:21,087 --> 00:13:22,553
       He called Courtney       
         then, he said,         

245
00:13:22,555 --> 00:13:24,855
    and they began a frantic    
     effort to revive her.      

246
00:13:28,428 --> 00:13:29,694
         KEITH MORRISON         
    (VOICEOVER): From what?     

247
00:13:29,696 --> 00:13:30,594
            A fall?             

248
00:13:30,596 --> 00:13:31,295
         Must've been.          

249
00:13:40,206 --> 00:13:41,639
         KEITH MORRISON         
     (VOICEOVER): But Chris     

250
00:13:41,641 --> 00:13:44,975
   apparently hadn't noticed    
  the nasty 3-inch laceration   

251
00:13:44,977 --> 00:13:46,543
       on Cristi's head.        

252
00:13:46,545 --> 00:13:50,481
    And here, suddenly, the     
 point of the police interview  

253
00:13:50,483 --> 00:13:51,181
          is revealed.          

254
00:14:02,661 --> 00:14:04,061
         KEITH MORRISON         
  (VOICEOVER): Not consistent   

255
00:14:04,063 --> 00:14:06,196
    with just falling down?     

256
00:14:06,198 --> 00:14:07,397
Why would the police think that?

257
00:14:12,571 --> 00:14:13,937
         KEITH MORRISON         
   (VOICEOVER): Why, in fact,   

258
00:14:13,939 --> 00:14:17,741
    was this ex-police chief    
    being questioned at all     

259
00:14:17,743 --> 00:14:20,143
      about the apparently      
    disastrous accident that    

260
00:14:20,145 --> 00:14:22,345
  killed the love of his life?  

261
00:14:22,347 --> 00:14:25,649
       And the answer was       
        right next door.        

262
00:14:25,651 --> 00:14:28,451
When Chris and Cristi Hall took 
their outdoor bath that morning 

263
00:14:28,453 --> 00:14:30,854
in June, someone was watching-- 

264
00:14:30,856 --> 00:14:31,921
              her.              

265
00:14:31,923 --> 00:14:33,656
        I got up at 6:00,       
         got my coffee.         

266
00:14:33,658 --> 00:14:35,158
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
       Lindsay Patterson        

267
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:39,095
  was on leave from her IT job  
 in the Navy, visiting her mom, 

268
00:14:39,097 --> 00:14:44,167
who lives just over the backyard
   wall from the Hall house.    

269
00:14:44,169 --> 00:14:47,070
   Lindsay was inside, in the   
    bathroom that faced away    

270
00:14:47,072 --> 00:14:49,305
    from the Hall house and     
     out on to the street,      

271
00:14:49,307 --> 00:14:50,973
    when she heard a noise.     

272
00:14:50,975 --> 00:14:52,742
    It was a horrible scream.   

273
00:14:52,744 --> 00:14:56,078
It was just something-was-wrong 
        kind of scream.         

274
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,481
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
    A woman's, she thought.     

275
00:14:58,483 --> 00:15:00,483
        She went outside        
        to tell her mom.        

276
00:15:00,485 --> 00:15:03,052
         And I said, did        
     you hear that scream?      

277
00:15:03,054 --> 00:15:06,789
And she said, yeah, but I think 
it's just kids playing in the-- 

278
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:07,890
      playing in the pool.      

279
00:15:07,892 --> 00:15:08,991
         KEITH MORRISON         
       (VOICEOVER): Kids?       

280
00:15:08,993 --> 00:15:11,427
 At 6-something in the morning? 

281
00:15:11,429 --> 00:15:13,929
   Lindsey walked over to the   
   6-foot brick wall between    

282
00:15:13,931 --> 00:15:15,698
   their yard and the Halls'.   

283
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:19,134
She stepped on the planter, she 
said, and looked over the wall. 

284
00:15:19,136 --> 00:15:23,772
     At that point, I saw a     
    man with, um, his hand--    

285
00:15:23,774 --> 00:15:26,442
        one hand on top         
       of a woman's head,       

286
00:15:26,444 --> 00:15:28,811
 and then one hand on her back. 

287
00:15:28,813 --> 00:15:30,779
        And she was face        
       down in the water.       

288
00:15:30,781 --> 00:15:32,181
  Like something was going on?  

289
00:15:32,183 --> 00:15:34,783
        Yeah, it-- that's       
        what I assumed.         

290
00:15:34,785 --> 00:15:36,919
KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): That
is, she thought she was looking 

291
00:15:36,921 --> 00:15:38,887
   at a sex act in progress.    

292
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:41,390
        I don't know why        
     it didn't seem right,      

293
00:15:41,392 --> 00:15:43,291
     but something made me      
      want to look again.       

294
00:15:43,293 --> 00:15:45,193
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
 Perhaps 90 seconds, she said,  

295
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:47,529
       between her first        
       and second looks.        

296
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:51,099
  And this time, she said, she  
  only saw the man in the spa.  

297
00:15:51,101 --> 00:15:54,669
     He's leaning back, just    
    relaxed in the hot tub.     

298
00:15:54,671 --> 00:15:56,137
      But I don't see her.      

299
00:15:56,139 --> 00:15:58,440
   He's got his elbows back,    
 and he's just kind of looking  

300
00:15:58,442 --> 00:16:00,308
     around, like nothing.      

301
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:02,010
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
    Where did the woman go?     

302
00:16:02,012 --> 00:16:04,412
      Lindsay told her mom      
   something seemed strange.    

303
00:16:04,414 --> 00:16:06,981
       She again tells me,      
   Lindsay, stop being nosy.    

304
00:16:06,983 --> 00:16:08,249
     Don't worry about it.      

305
00:16:08,251 --> 00:16:14,155
        Um, but it just         
       didn't seem right.       

306
00:16:14,157 --> 00:16:16,024
     It wasn't enough time      
     for her to have gotten     

307
00:16:16,026 --> 00:16:18,292
 out and gone inside the house. 

308
00:16:18,294 --> 00:16:19,494
         KEITH MORRISON         
     (VOICEOVER): So, said      

309
00:16:19,496 --> 00:16:21,929
       Lindsay, she went        
       to the wall again,       

310
00:16:21,931 --> 00:16:24,265
   her third and final look.    

311
00:16:24,267 --> 00:16:26,501
      At that point, he was     
  getting out of the Jacuzzi.   

312
00:16:26,503 --> 00:16:29,704
       Case And he was in       
        a very big rush.        

313
00:16:29,706 --> 00:16:31,906
        And she's still         
      nowhere to be seen.       

314
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:37,511
    The look on his face was    
     almost undescribable.      

315
00:16:37,513 --> 00:16:41,115
   It was almost as if he had   
 just gone into another world.  

316
00:16:41,117 --> 00:16:42,783
         It was scary.          

317
00:16:42,785 --> 00:16:44,118
         KEITH MORRISON         
      (VOICEOVER): It was       

318
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,621
instinct that told her something
    was wrong, said Lindsay.    

319
00:16:47,623 --> 00:16:48,822
       So she called 911.       

320
00:16:48,824 --> 00:16:53,160
        [phone ringing]         

321
00:16:53,162 --> 00:16:55,729
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
 So now, hours and hours later, 

322
00:16:55,731 --> 00:16:58,832
   the detectives confronted    
  Chris with Lindsay's story.   

323
00:16:58,834 --> 00:17:02,603
    Why, they asked, didn't     
      her story match his?      

324
00:17:17,553 --> 00:17:18,852
         KEITH MORRISON         
    (VOICEOVER): So now that    

325
00:17:18,854 --> 00:17:20,720
question we posed as we began-- 

326
00:17:20,722 --> 00:17:25,492
     did Lindsay Patterson      
   really know what she saw?    

327
00:17:25,494 --> 00:17:26,960

354
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:43,686
       police asked Chris       
        Hall to explain         

355
00:20:43,688 --> 00:20:45,188
  what happened that morning.   

356
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:49,192
What Chris did not know was that
  his neighbor had also talked  

357
00:20:49,194 --> 00:20:52,628
    to police, and she told     
     a very different story     

358
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:54,597
than the one Chris was telling. 

359
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:56,032
 Here again is Keith Morrison.  

360
00:20:57,902 --> 00:20:59,802
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
 Chris and Cristi Hall's three  

361
00:20:59,804 --> 00:21:02,438
    daughters clung together    
       in grief and shock       

362
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,174
     all through the dismal     
  evening hours of that worst   

363
00:21:05,176 --> 00:21:08,844
       of all days, June        
        7, 2007, waiting        

364
00:21:08,846 --> 00:21:11,614
   for their father to return   
    from the police station.    

365
00:21:11,616 --> 00:21:15,184
     And they wondered why      
     was it taking so long.     

366
00:21:15,186 --> 00:21:18,087
    Then the phone rang, and    
     they had their answer.     

367
00:21:18,089 --> 00:21:19,555
         You know, it--         

368
00:21:19,557 --> 00:21:20,623
        broken-up words.        

369
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,958
        And he's crying,        
       and we're crying.        

370
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,928
        And that-- that         
       was when he said,        

371
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,963
 they-- they think I hurt mom.  

372
00:21:27,965 --> 00:21:30,766
   I mean, he was very upset.   

373
00:21:30,768 --> 00:21:32,868
  But he didn't sound surprised 
  when he said, they think I--  

374
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,269
         He was crying.         
         He was crying.         

375
00:21:34,271 --> 00:21:35,070
          He was upset.         

376
00:21:35,072 --> 00:21:36,972
           Very upset.          

377
00:21:36,974 --> 00:21:38,407
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
        But by the time         

378
00:21:38,409 --> 00:21:40,609
      police investigators      
    were questioning Chris,     

379
00:21:40,611 --> 00:21:43,578
    remember, they had heard    
    from Lindsay Patterson.     

380
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,581
  And at the station, Chris's   
  version of events in the spa  

381
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:49,785
 differed in one crucial detail 
  from what Lindsay described   

382
00:21:49,787 --> 00:21:52,287
     seeing that first time     
    she peered over the wall    

383
00:21:52,289 --> 00:21:53,688
 and into the Halls' backyard.  

384
00:22:11,808 --> 00:22:13,308
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
       But investigators        

385
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,343
      were getting a good       
     look at Cristi's body,     

386
00:22:15,345 --> 00:22:17,478
      and saw wounds that,      
       to them, suggested       

387
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,983
   a struggle, and more than    
  one nasty blow to the head.   

388
00:22:21,985 --> 00:22:25,186
  So the police had to choose   
  which version, Chris Hall's   

389
00:22:25,188 --> 00:22:28,422
  or Lindsay Patterson's, was   
   more likely the true story   

390
00:22:28,424 --> 00:22:30,024
       of what happened.        

391
00:22:30,026 --> 00:22:31,659
         Tom Dove is a          
      senior investigator       

392
00:22:31,661 --> 00:22:33,261
     for the Riverside DA.      

393
00:22:33,263 --> 00:22:35,796
     I think they felt there    
     was enough to say this     

394
00:22:35,798 --> 00:22:38,499
was not an accidental drowning. 

395
00:22:38,501 --> 00:22:41,135
    It was clearly much more    
     suspicious than that.      

396
00:22:41,137 --> 00:22:43,704
KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): And 
 so before the night was over,  

397
00:22:43,706 --> 00:22:46,407
         Chris Hall was         
      arrested and charged      

398
00:22:46,409 --> 00:22:48,809
  with the murder of his wife.  

399
00:22:48,811 --> 00:22:50,911
 The girls could stop waiting.  

400
00:22:50,913 --> 00:22:52,546
     He wasn't coming home.     

401
00:22:52,548 --> 00:22:56,083
   It was obviously a tragedy,  
  losing our mother that day.   

402
00:22:56,085 --> 00:22:58,619
     But this is a tragedy      
    on top of a tragedy now.    

403
00:22:58,621 --> 00:23:01,889
   Just because knowing our--   
    our parents, it's just--    

404
00:23:01,891 --> 00:23:04,191
         --the farthest         
     thing from the truth.      

405
00:23:04,193 --> 00:23:05,659
         KEITH MORRISON         
      (VOICEOVER): And one      

406
00:23:05,661 --> 00:23:08,462
that felt infected by some kind 
  of madness, said the girls.   

407
00:23:08,464 --> 00:23:11,031
     Cristi was the love of     
      their father's life,      

408
00:23:11,033 --> 00:23:14,001
     after all-- the center     
     of everything for him.     

409
00:23:14,003 --> 00:23:15,769
      How, they wondered,       
        could anyone so         

410
00:23:15,771 --> 00:23:20,140
 happy in his marriage and his  
life be accused of harming her? 

411
00:23:20,142 --> 00:23:22,576
       And she was happy        
        too, they said--        

412
00:23:22,578 --> 00:23:24,244
  as happy as she'd ever been.  

413
00:23:24,246 --> 00:23:27,080
 They knew it, they said, based 
  on that mother-daughter talk  

414
00:23:27,082 --> 00:23:29,749
       they had not long        
        before she died.        

415
00:23:29,751 --> 00:23:31,117
        ASHTIN HALL: She        
     just kept reiterating.     

416
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:32,385
   It was how happy she was.    

417
00:23:32,387 --> 00:23:34,154
          Kind of odd.          

418
00:23:34,156 --> 00:23:36,423
      And me and Brie will      
      always cherish that.      

419
00:23:36,425 --> 00:23:38,858
     Of course, didn't think    
    much of it at that time.    

420
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,260
              Yeah.             

421
00:23:40,262 --> 00:23:42,562
    That that being the last    
   time we actually saw her.    

422
00:23:42,564 --> 00:23:43,763
         Kind of burned         
      into your memories.       

423
00:23:43,765 --> 00:23:45,131
              Yeah.             
     KEITH MORRISON: Yeah.      

424
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:47,901
 But right or wrong, the legal  
    trigger had been pulled.    

425
00:23:47,903 --> 00:23:49,969
        Chris Hall spent        
       almost two months        

426
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:52,805
  in jail, until his daughters  
      received the payout       

427
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:54,941
       from Cristi's life       
        insurance policy        

428
00:23:54,943 --> 00:23:58,411
   and used the money to meet   
    his million-dollar bail.    

429
00:23:58,413 --> 00:24:01,314
    And then he went back to    
 what was to be his retirement  

430
00:24:01,316 --> 00:24:04,550
    retreat to prepare, with    
   the help of his daughters,   

431
00:24:04,552 --> 00:24:06,052
      for a murder trial.       

432
00:24:06,054 --> 00:24:08,654
   That's very surprising, to   
 have a client in a murder case 

433
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:09,755
          out on bail.          

434
00:24:09,757 --> 00:24:12,325
      But he was a special      
         man, and, uh,          

435
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:14,360
 this was a special situation.  

436
00:24:14,362 --> 00:24:15,461
         KEITH MORRISON         
       (VOICEOVER): These       

437
00:24:15,463 --> 00:24:17,096
       are attorneys who        
        would eventually        

438
00:24:17,098 --> 00:24:20,800
  defend him, though at first,  
they only heard about the case. 

439
00:24:20,802 --> 00:24:23,135
  Steve Harmon and Paul Grech.  

440
00:24:23,137 --> 00:24:26,205
 You've said two things there-- 
special man, special situation. 

441
00:24:26,207 --> 00:24:28,340
   I think both of us can say   
   that this is a man that--    

442
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:31,477
 that we like and that we know, 
   and we don't feel he could   

443
00:24:31,479 --> 00:24:32,978
 have done anything like this.  

444
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,647
 KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): So 
  Chris Hall and his daughters  

445
00:24:34,649 --> 00:24:36,482
      prepared for a trial      
        which they hoped        

446
00:24:36,484 --> 00:24:38,951
      would make clear to       
    everybody-- the police,     

447
00:24:38,953 --> 00:24:41,186
   the neighbor, the world--    

448
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,555
        that Chris would        
      not, could not, did       

449
00:24:43,557 --> 00:24:46,158
 not harm the love of his life. 

450
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,595
       There was never, in      
     30 years of marriage--     

451
00:24:49,597 --> 00:24:52,064
 never one moment of violence.  

452
00:24:52,066 --> 00:24:54,666
    There was no motive for     
   this man to kill his wife.   

453
00:24:54,668 --> 00:24:56,201
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
        Harmon and Grech        

454
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:59,071
 had a look at neighbor Lindsay 
 Patterson's eyewitness account 

455
00:24:59,073 --> 00:25:02,374
  and suggested it was really   
     not conclusive at all.     

456
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:05,076
 It was tragically incomplete.  

457
00:25:05,078 --> 00:25:06,978
    She saw three snapshots.    

458
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,581
       What is missed by        
      everyone is the wife      

459
00:25:09,583 --> 00:25:13,785
   getting into the Jacuzzi,    
       slipping, falling        

460
00:25:13,787 --> 00:25:16,354
       into the Jacuzzi,        
       hitting her head,        

461
00:25:16,356 --> 00:25:18,823
going unconscious, and drowning.

462
00:25:18,825 --> 00:25:20,458
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
     See this sharp corner      

463
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,293
   sticking out into the spa?   

464
00:25:22,295 --> 00:25:25,430
Hitting your head on this would 
  certainly have opened a gash  

465
00:25:25,432 --> 00:25:27,899
       and knocked Cristi       
    out, said the attorney.     

466
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:31,102
 She didn't see what was really 
   happening during the times   

467
00:25:31,104 --> 00:25:32,603
   when she was not looking.    

468
00:25:32,605 --> 00:25:34,272
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
 That scream that made Lindsay  

469
00:25:34,274 --> 00:25:36,307
 Patterson look over the wall?  

470
00:25:36,309 --> 00:25:38,409
     Lindsay, they pointed      
     out, was in a bathroom     

471
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:39,844
     that faced the street.     

472
00:25:39,846 --> 00:25:42,747
   She wasn't in the backyard   
  when she says she heard it.   

473
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,315
    Could have been anybody.    

474
00:25:44,317 --> 00:25:46,918
  And Courtney, who was inside  
  her own house near the spa,   

475
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,085
      didn't hear a thing.      

476
00:25:48,087 --> 00:25:50,955
       And we don't think       
       that she's lying.        

477
00:25:50,957 --> 00:25:52,957
       We just think she        
  misinterpreted what she saw.  

478
00:25:52,959 --> 00:25:54,558
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
      And anyway, Lindsay,      

479
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,427
          to a certain          
      degree, concedes she      

480
00:25:56,429 --> 00:26:00,498
didn't know what she was seeing 
 in her glimpses that morning.  

481
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,132
       LINDSAY PATTERSON:       
      Something was wrong.      

482
00:26:02,134 --> 00:26:03,667
       And yet, you hadn't      
     really seen any of it.     

483
00:26:03,669 --> 00:26:04,969
             I-- no.            

484
00:26:04,971 --> 00:26:07,238
But I knew something was wrong. 

485
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,708
  I don't know if in my brain,  
 I was putting things together. 

486
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:15,379
      But from between the      
  scream, the position that he  

487
00:26:15,381 --> 00:26:18,615
was holding her, and then not-- 

488
00:26:18,617 --> 00:26:21,718
just not having enough time for 
 her-- her to have gone inside. 

489
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,022
  So it's like you kind of got  
  three different snapshots--   

490
00:26:25,024 --> 00:26:26,056
             Right.             

491
00:26:26,058 --> 00:26:27,090
         --of something         
       going on in there.       

492
00:26:27,092 --> 00:26:27,991
             Right.             

493
00:26:27,993 --> 00:26:29,359
  And had to kind of work out-- 

494
00:26:29,361 --> 00:26:30,160
              Yeah.             

495
00:26:30,162 --> 00:26:31,361
        --what this was.        

496
00:26:31,363 --> 00:26:32,496
       You know, I wasn't       
    thinking at that point,     

497
00:26:32,498 --> 00:26:34,197
       oh, this man just        
       murdered his wife.       

498
00:26:34,199 --> 00:26:35,432
         KEITH MORRISON         
     (VOICEOVER): But now,      

499
00:26:35,434 --> 00:26:38,301
     based largely on that      
      account, Chris Hall       

500
00:26:38,303 --> 00:26:40,804
 would go on trial for murder.  

501
00:26:40,806 --> 00:26:43,039
       And it was a trial       
     for his daughters too.     

502
00:26:43,041 --> 00:26:45,041
   BRIANA HALL: He loved her.   

503
00:26:45,043 --> 00:26:46,509
         They were each         
     other's best friends.      

504
00:26:46,511 --> 00:26:49,879
    And-- and this is just--    
    this is not fair to him,    

505
00:26:49,881 --> 00:26:53,850
   because he truly loved her   
 more than-- more than anyone.  

506
00:26:53,852 --> 00:26:55,518
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
    And yet, the prosecutor     

507
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,088
 was going to try to prove that 
 this family man and former cop 

508
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:01,491
       murdered his wife.       

509
00:27:01,493 --> 00:27:03,293
       Could it be done?

hot to relax.                   

541
00:29:27,603 --> 00:30:43,143
Rise from Pain. Icy Hot.        

542
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:45,879
         Welcome back.          

543
00:30:45,881 --> 00:30:47,046
       I'm Craig Melvin.        

544
00:30:47,048 --> 00:30:48,882
     Chris Hall was charged     
        in the drowning         

545
00:30:48,884 --> 00:30:50,717
   death of his wife, Cristi.   

546
00:30:50,719 --> 00:30:53,786
 As prosecutors were preparing  
     to lay out their case,     

547
00:30:53,788 --> 00:30:57,590
 Hall's daughters stood by him, 
   proclaiming his innocence.   

548
00:30:57,592 --> 00:31:01,327
  Would anything change their   
     minds about their dad?     

549
00:31:01,329 --> 00:31:03,563
 Here again is Keith Morrison.  

550
00:31:03,565 --> 00:31:04,931
         KEITH MORRISON         
  (VOICEOVER): Burke Strunsky   

551
00:31:04,933 --> 00:31:06,833
    is a hard-charging man--    

552
00:31:06,835 --> 00:31:09,869
 ex-member in good standing of  
 the San Francisco DA's office, 

553
00:31:09,871 --> 00:31:12,972
       now senior deputy        
        DA in Riverside.        

554
00:31:12,974 --> 00:31:16,309
       That takes skill,        
       persuasive powers.       

555
00:31:16,311 --> 00:31:18,544
      Strunsky would need       
       them in the murder       

556
00:31:18,546 --> 00:31:20,246
        case against the        
      former police chief       

557
00:31:20,248 --> 00:31:22,548
  and family man, Chris Hall.   

558
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:26,786
     Mr. Hall on the surface    
looks like a loving family man. 

559
00:31:26,788 --> 00:31:28,621
  He looks like a good father.  

560
00:31:28,623 --> 00:31:32,958
    He was somebody that had    
   the support of his family.   

561
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,226
         KEITH MORRISON         
    (VOICEOVER): So he did.     

562
00:31:34,228 --> 00:31:35,995
      But Strunsky wasn't       
       buying the loving        

563
00:31:35,997 --> 00:31:37,663
   father and family man bit.   

564
00:31:37,665 --> 00:31:39,131
              No.               

565
00:31:39,133 --> 00:31:42,201
When he heard about Chris Hall's
very obvious grief, the wailing 

566
00:31:42,203 --> 00:31:44,904
     that went on after the     
      so-called accident,       

567
00:31:44,906 --> 00:31:48,507
    the phrase that crossed     
   his mind was, it's an act.   

568
00:31:48,509 --> 00:31:50,743
      And I think it was a      
     wonderful performance      

569
00:31:50,745 --> 00:31:54,179
   by the defendant of acting   
    like a bereaved husband.    

570
00:31:54,181 --> 00:31:58,050
    But when you look at his    
   actions, um, how little he   

571
00:31:58,052 --> 00:31:59,752
     did to help his wife--     

572
00:31:59,754 --> 00:32:02,287
KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): Who 
  tried harder to save Cristi?  

573
00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:06,191
      Not Chris, said the       
 prosecutor, but his daughter.  

574
00:32:06,193 --> 00:32:07,426
BURKE STRUNSKY: She called 911. 

575
00:32:07,428 --> 00:32:09,762
     She helped him get the     
      body out of the spa.      

576
00:32:09,764 --> 00:32:12,131
    She is the only one that    
    did chest compressions.     

577
00:32:12,133 --> 00:32:14,666
     He had no interest in      
    truly helping his wife.     

578
00:32:14,668 --> 00:32:17,469
 KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): A  
 matter of opinion, of course.  

579
00:32:17,471 --> 00:32:20,806
 But Prosecutor Strunsky poked  
  around in Chris Hall's past   

580
00:32:20,808 --> 00:32:21,974
        as a policeman.         

581
00:32:21,976 --> 00:32:24,009
     And what did he find?      

582
00:32:24,011 --> 00:32:28,480
     This man had an uncanny    
 ability to fabricate stories.  

583
00:32:28,482 --> 00:32:30,082
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
      Seven years earlier,      

584
00:32:30,084 --> 00:32:33,351
    while Hall was chief of     
   police in Cascade, Idaho,    

585
00:32:33,353 --> 00:32:35,087
         he was charged         
       with and convicted       

586
00:32:35,089 --> 00:32:37,456
   of misuse of public money.   

587
00:32:37,458 --> 00:32:41,793
    Embezzled $19,000, spent    
      10 months in jail--       

588
00:32:41,795 --> 00:32:44,396
         a white collar         
     crime, hardly murder.      

589
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:46,698
      But what struck the       
     prosecutor is that he      

590
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,267
says Hall tried to cover it up. 

591
00:32:49,269 --> 00:32:52,137
  To plan a fraud, to lie about 
  it-- not just lie about it,   

592
00:32:52,139 --> 00:32:53,672
 but lie about it effectively.  

593
00:32:53,674 --> 00:32:57,208
  I think that was very telling 
ababout who we were dealing wit.

594
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:59,010
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
   Suddenly, the prosecutor's   

595
00:32:59,012 --> 00:33:01,112
 prospects were looking better. 

596
00:33:01,114 --> 00:33:03,415
     At the trial, Strunsky     
     made Lindsay Patterson     

597
00:33:03,417 --> 00:33:04,616
  his star witness, of course.  

598
00:33:04,618 --> 00:33:06,418
       It was her story,        
        after all, that         

599
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,253
  got the whole thing started.  

600
00:33:08,255 --> 00:33:10,822
  But almost as important, he   
  called the Riverside County   

601
00:33:10,824 --> 00:33:14,492
medical examiner, who testified 
     that those lacerations     

602
00:33:14,494 --> 00:33:16,661
     in Cristi's head could     
      not, in his opinion,      

603
00:33:16,663 --> 00:33:19,797
    have been the result of     
   a single accidental fall.    

604
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:21,766
       And the ME argued        
      the particular type       

605
00:33:21,768 --> 00:33:23,901
         of bruising on         
     Cristi's face and body     

606
00:33:23,903 --> 00:33:25,770
  was a hallmark of homicide.   

607
00:33:25,772 --> 00:33:26,804
             Sure.              

608
00:33:26,806 --> 00:33:28,640
         The totality of        
       injuries were not        

609
00:33:28,642 --> 00:33:31,209
    consistent with somebody    
     slipping and falling,      

610
00:33:31,211 --> 00:33:32,977
   and then a rescue attempt.   

611
00:33:32,979 --> 00:33:34,879
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
 And there was a clump of hair  

612
00:33:34,881 --> 00:33:37,014
      in the bottom of the      
    spa, still entwined with    

613
00:33:37,016 --> 00:33:39,383
  a broken plastic hair clip.   

614
00:33:39,385 --> 00:33:41,753
   That, said the prosecutor,   
        could only have         

615
00:33:41,755 --> 00:33:43,688
 come from a violent struggle.  

616
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:45,256
          When you lose         
      that amount of hair,      

617
00:33:45,258 --> 00:33:48,192
 it's not reasonably explained  
      by any kind of fall.      

618
00:33:48,194 --> 00:33:49,460
         KEITH MORRISON         
    (VOICEOVER): There were     

619
00:33:49,462 --> 00:33:51,996
some minor hiccups in the case. 

620
00:33:51,998 --> 00:33:55,967
Lindsay Patterson, for example, 
   was a little inconsistent    

621
00:33:55,969 --> 00:33:58,569
   about how long she looked    
     over the backyard wall     

622
00:33:58,571 --> 00:34:01,539
      that first time she       
    saw something going on.     

623
00:34:01,541 --> 00:34:05,476
   Was it just a few seconds,   
    or as long as a minute?     

624
00:34:05,478 --> 00:34:07,878
        But either way,         
      said the prosecutor,      

625
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,781
      Lindsay was sure she      
     saw physical contact.      

626
00:34:10,783 --> 00:34:12,650
 That was the important thing.  

627
00:34:12,652 --> 00:34:16,187
  He was given the opportunity  
to explain any physical contact 

628
00:34:16,189 --> 00:34:19,089
     that could in any way      
       reasonably explain       

629
00:34:19,091 --> 00:34:20,791
 what Lindsay Patterson missaw. 

630
00:34:20,793 --> 00:34:22,760
      In other words, were      
    they washing each other?    

631
00:34:22,762 --> 00:34:24,528
Were they involved in a sex act?

632
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:28,332
  Was there anything that she   
   could have misinterpreted?   

633
00:34:28,334 --> 00:34:29,600
       And at the end of        
        the day, you're         

634
00:34:29,602 --> 00:34:31,835
      not just stuck with       
     the fact that Lindsay      

635
00:34:31,837 --> 00:34:33,771
   Patterson made a mistake.    

636
00:34:33,773 --> 00:34:35,439
      You have to actually      
      believe that Lindsay      

637
00:34:35,441 --> 00:34:38,709
 Patterson really hallucinated  
   about everything she saw.    

638
00:34:38,711 --> 00:34:40,611
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
 And what made Lindsay's story  

639
00:34:40,613 --> 00:34:43,047
    all the more convincing,    
   said Prosecutor Strunsky,    

640
00:34:43,049 --> 00:34:47,051
 was she told it before finding 
  out what happened to Cristi.  

641
00:34:47,053 --> 00:34:49,820
     She dialed 911 a full      
       minute and a half        

642
00:34:49,822 --> 00:34:51,855
       before anyone from       
         the Hall house         

643
00:34:51,857 --> 00:34:55,826
    did, before Lindsay had     
   any idea how it would end.   

644
00:34:55,828 --> 00:34:58,095
   Here's what the jury heard   
     her say in that call.      

645
00:35:02,535 --> 00:35:04,001
         KEITH MORRISON         
      (VOICEOVER): And she      

646
00:35:04,003 --> 00:35:07,271
was still on the phone with 911 
  when Chris Hall came outside  

647
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:09,706
      and found his wife's      
   body floating in the spa,    

648
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:13,210
    called out for Courtney.    

649
00:35:13,212 --> 00:35:15,812
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
  The investigator, Tom Dove.   

650
00:35:15,814 --> 00:35:18,248
         I heard it best        
   described during the trial   

651
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:24,588
 as a cosmic coincidence, that  
  someone could see something   

652
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:27,157
   that they perceived to be    
    more than just some kind    

653
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:30,594
     of kinky action in the     
    Jacuzzi in the morning,     

654
00:35:30,596 --> 00:35:32,529
     and then that actually     
     turned out to be true,     

655
00:35:32,531 --> 00:35:34,998
   that a woman was actually    
      drowned in that spa.      

656
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,067
   That is not a coincidence.   

657
00:35:37,069 --> 00:35:39,536
     That is what she saw.      

658
00:35:39,538 --> 00:35:41,471
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
   The prosecution's theory?    

659
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:44,107
      Somehow, sitting in       
     the spa that morning,      

660
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:47,277
     Chris was overcome by      
      some private fury--       

661
00:35:47,279 --> 00:35:48,778
        who knows what?         

662
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:52,015
     "A hidden violence" is     
   what Strunsky called it--    

663
00:35:52,017 --> 00:35:55,285
and then killed his spouse when 
 he thought nobody was looking. 

664
00:35:55,287 --> 00:35:58,822
     Chris Hall ambushed his    
 wife, grabbed her by the hair, 

665
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:03,126
     slammed her head twice     
    into the concrete edge.     

666
00:36:03,128 --> 00:36:07,897
He's holding his wife of almost 
 three decades under the water, 

667
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:10,700
     showing absolutely no      
     mercy and no remorse,      

668
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:16,439
   and an absolute desire to    
  end her life at that point.   

669
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:18,875
KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): And 
 then the piece de resistance.  

670
00:36:18,877 --> 00:36:20,777
    BURKE STRUNSKY: He then     
      gets out of the spa,      

671
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:23,479
     walks into the house,      
       where his plan is        

672
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:27,250
    to wake his 22-year-old     
       daughter, who he--       

673
00:36:27,252 --> 00:36:30,220
       who he can use as        
        a alibi witness.        

674
00:36:30,222 --> 00:36:31,821
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
      One little quibble--      

675
00:36:31,823 --> 00:36:33,122
              why?              

676
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:35,959
    In fact, as convinced as    
    he was of Hall's guilt,     

677
00:36:35,961 --> 00:36:40,063
     Strunsky conceded the      
       why was a problem.       

678
00:36:40,065 --> 00:36:44,634
  Didn't legally have to know,  
  he said, but he just didn't.  

679
00:36:44,636 --> 00:36:46,135
         There it was.          

680
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:50,039
  It's emotionally unsatisfying 
    not to have that answer,    

681
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:53,142
     not to know the entire     
  narrative of what happened.   

682
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:56,279
   But you'd want to know why   
this guy, married to this woman 

683
00:36:56,281 --> 00:36:58,314
      for almost 30 years,      
      apparently happily,       

684
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:02,485
   would suddenly turn on her   
   and drown her in the pool.   

685
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:03,686
             Right.             

686
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:05,454
     And I'm not sure we--      
       we got the answers       

687
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:06,956
   to that specific question.   

688
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:08,191
        Uh, [inaudible].        

689
00:37:08,193 --> 00:37:09,358
      Kind of an important      
      question, isn't it?       

690
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,826
        It's an important       
    question, and a question    

691
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:13,729
       that we ask in all       
       spousal homicides.       

692
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,731
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
       So, proof enough?        

693
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,267
      Or reasonable doubt?      

694
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:21,070
    Almost three years after    
      Cristi Hall's death,      

695
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:24,273
        a Riverside jury        
     would have to decide.      

696
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:25,741
   CRAIG MELVIN (VOICEOVER):    
       "Dateline" returns       

697
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:26,475

00:41:06,062 --> 00:41:07,729
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
     Chris Hall's daughters     

752
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:10,498
  sat through every miserable   
     minute of their dad's      

753
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,600
     trial for murder here      
       at the courthouse        

754
00:41:12,602 --> 00:41:14,569
   in Riverside, California.    

755
00:41:14,571 --> 00:41:17,872
Their review of the prosecutor's
   portrait of their father?    

756
00:41:17,874 --> 00:41:20,174
    It was a lie, they said.    

757
00:41:20,176 --> 00:41:23,378
   It's hurtful to us to hear   
 someone basically say that he  

758
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,880
       knows our parents        
       better than we do,       

759
00:41:25,882 --> 00:41:29,450
        and he knows our        
     father's a sociopath,      

760
00:41:29,452 --> 00:41:32,386
  and that we're blind to it,   
  and he knows that there was   

761
00:41:32,388 --> 00:41:34,155
       hidden violence in       
     our parents' marriage,     

762
00:41:34,157 --> 00:41:35,790
   and we just didn't see it.   

763
00:41:35,792 --> 00:41:37,291
        You're basically        
       telling us that we       

764
00:41:37,293 --> 00:41:39,560
      don't know that our       
    whole lives were a lie.     

765
00:41:39,562 --> 00:41:40,328
          And there's--         

766
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:41,596
         That is just--         

767
00:41:41,598 --> 00:41:42,697
        To top that off,        
   there's no proof of that.    

768
00:41:42,699 --> 00:41:43,931
         KEITH MORRISON         
    (VOICEOVER): Chris Hall     

769
00:41:43,933 --> 00:41:46,267
    had never been violent,     
      argued the defense;       

770
00:41:46,269 --> 00:41:49,837
  had no motive, no reason to   
   suddenly turn on his wife.   

771
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:52,573
 It had to be a freak accident. 

772
00:41:52,575 --> 00:41:55,610
 So, said the defense, Lindsay  
    Patterson didn't really     

773
00:41:55,612 --> 00:41:57,345
       know what she saw.       

774
00:41:57,347 --> 00:42:00,381
    In fact if she'd really     
 witnessed Chris Hall drowning  

775
00:42:00,383 --> 00:42:02,216
      his wife, why, then,      
        didn't she claim        

776
00:42:02,218 --> 00:42:06,120
  to see Cristi's body in the   
   spa when she looked again?   

777
00:42:06,122 --> 00:42:08,222
       Didn't make sense.       

778
00:42:08,224 --> 00:42:10,892
   But the highlight was the    
  Hall daughters' testimony--   

779
00:42:10,894 --> 00:42:13,861
   emotional, quite powerful.   

780
00:42:13,863 --> 00:42:16,530
 So it put Prosecutor Strunsky  
    in a strange position--     

781
00:42:16,532 --> 00:42:19,400
        at odds with the        
      victim's own family.      

782
00:42:19,402 --> 00:42:20,801
     Things were so clear.      

783
00:42:20,803 --> 00:42:25,172
    If we had any inkling he    
   had done this, believe me,   

784
00:42:25,174 --> 00:42:26,240
     we would have said so.     

785
00:42:26,242 --> 00:42:27,108
      BURKE STRUNSKY: And       
        I think that's--        

786
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:28,142
   And we would have seen it.   

787
00:42:28,144 --> 00:42:29,277
        I-- I think that        
        that's what they        

788
00:42:29,279 --> 00:42:31,312
 truly believe in their hearts. 

789
00:42:31,314 --> 00:42:33,214
       And, you know, it        
     weighs on me greatly.      

790
00:42:33,216 --> 00:42:36,384
      But my job is to get      
    justice for Cristi Hall.    

791
00:42:36,386 --> 00:42:39,120
KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): Now 
 it was up to a jury to decide. 

792
00:42:39,122 --> 00:42:41,255
       After six days of        
      testimony, two days       

793
00:42:41,257 --> 00:42:45,092
of deliberation, they couldn't. 

794
00:42:45,094 --> 00:42:47,094
       It was a deadlock.       

795
00:42:47,096 --> 00:42:48,996
 The judge declared a mistrial. 

796
00:42:48,998 --> 00:42:53,034
 Chris Hall walked out of court 
 with his family free, but not  

797
00:42:53,036 --> 00:42:56,670
    quite in the clear, and     
 nothing at all like a victory  

798
00:42:56,672 --> 00:42:58,572
    for the Hall daughters.     

799
00:42:58,574 --> 00:43:00,174
      What was it like to       
      get that hung jury?       

800
00:43:00,176 --> 00:43:00,975
    What did you think then?    

801
00:43:00,977 --> 00:43:01,742
           That was--           

802
00:43:01,744 --> 00:43:02,610
        That was tragic.        

803
00:43:02,612 --> 00:43:04,278
   That was devastating to us.  

804
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,613
         You expected a         
      not guilty verdict?       

805
00:43:05,615 --> 00:43:06,580
           - Oh, yes.           
            - Yeah.             

806
00:43:06,582 --> 00:43:07,915
          Not a doubt.          

807
00:43:07,917 --> 00:43:09,250
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
    Deputy DA Burke Strunsky    

808
00:43:09,252 --> 00:43:11,752
        was disappointed        
       too, and was also        

809
00:43:11,754 --> 00:43:14,488
 determined to retry the case.  

810
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:17,691
     But first, he set his      
  investigator on a mission--   

811
00:43:17,693 --> 00:43:21,595
    to explore the life and     
    marriage of Chris Hall.     

812
00:43:21,597 --> 00:43:23,631
     And what do you know?      

813
00:43:23,633 --> 00:43:26,801
 In Idaho, where Hall had been  
   a disgraced police chief,    

814
00:43:26,803 --> 00:43:30,471
   the investigator uncovered   
    a startling accusation.     

815
00:43:30,473 --> 00:43:34,308
           Chris was a          
      great, great conman.      

816
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:35,810
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
       Former Los Angeles       

817
00:43:35,812 --> 00:43:38,646
      police officer Jerry      
       Winkle, the county       

818
00:43:38,648 --> 00:43:40,815
   commissioner up in Idaho.    

819
00:43:40,817 --> 00:43:44,318
    But once upon a time, he    
   was Chris Hall's friend--    

820
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:47,421
   that is, before a night of   
poker and booze, when, he said, 

821
00:43:47,423 --> 00:43:49,757
          Hall made a           
     disturbing revelation      

822
00:43:49,759 --> 00:43:51,992
         that he'd shot         
       himself in the leg       

823
00:43:51,994 --> 00:43:54,094
       when he was a cop        
        in order to get         

824
00:43:54,096 --> 00:43:57,064
  medical retirement benefits.  

825
00:43:57,066 --> 00:43:59,900
  Chris had been drinking beer. 

826
00:43:59,902 --> 00:44:04,138
 And he came right out and told 
  me that he had shot himself.  

827
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:05,973
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
      But there was more.       

828
00:44:05,975 --> 00:44:10,077
    DA investigator Tom Dove    
   had discovered a secret--    

829
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:13,614
      not in Chris's past,      
        but in Cristi's.        

830
00:44:13,616 --> 00:44:15,749
        TOM DOVE: There         
      had been infidelity       

831
00:44:15,751 --> 00:44:17,685
      in the marriage for       
        six years prior,        

832
00:44:17,687 --> 00:44:20,921
      while Chris Hall was      
      in custody in Idaho.      

833
00:44:20,923 --> 00:44:22,823
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
 Cristi's affair was relatively 

834
00:44:22,825 --> 00:44:24,959
     brief, years earlier.      

835
00:44:24,961 --> 00:44:26,961
    But she'd been in phone     
      contact with the man      

836
00:44:26,963 --> 00:44:29,296
   just days before she died.   

837
00:44:29,298 --> 00:44:31,332
      Had Chris found out?      

838
00:44:31,334 --> 00:44:33,400
      Impossible to know.       

839
00:44:33,402 --> 00:44:36,170
   But when Investigator Dove   
  talked to Cristi's coworkers  

840
00:44:36,172 --> 00:44:38,472
    at the clinic where she     
    was an x-ray technician,    

841
00:44:38,474 --> 00:44:40,074
        several of them         
       said they noticed        

842
00:44:40,076 --> 00:44:43,944
     a sudden change in her     
  usually vibrant personality.  

843
00:44:43,946 --> 00:44:45,813
   One coworker offered more.   

844
00:44:45,815 --> 00:44:48,883
    She told us that she was    
    contemplating a divorce.    

845
00:44:48,885 --> 00:44:51,886
 KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): If 
 true-- and it was only an if-- 

846
00:44:51,888 --> 00:44:55,189
 it might well persuade a jury. 

847
00:44:55,191 --> 00:44:58,192
 But also, Prosecutor Strunsky  
 needed to explain what Lindsay 

848
00:44:58,194 --> 00:45:00,261
  Patterson saw or didn't see.  

849
00:45:00,263 --> 00:45:04,198
  Why didn't she see Cristi's   
  drowned body when she peaked  

850
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,967
  over the wall a second time?  

851
00:45:06,969 --> 00:45:09,637
       We were not able to      
      explain to the jury       

852
00:45:09,639 --> 00:45:13,174
       why she didn't see       
     Cristi at that point.      

853
00:45:13,176 --> 00:45:16,343
  And I think that allowed the  
  defense to make the argument  

854
00:45:16,345 --> 00:45:18,279
  that Cristi Hall was inside.  

855
00:45:18,281 --> 00:45:19,747
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
        The prosecution         

856
00:45:19,749 --> 00:45:24,552
  hired a water expert to do a  
  recreation of the Hall spa.   

857
00:45:24,554 --> 00:45:27,121
    Andrea Zaferes has been     
   assisting law enforcement    

858
00:45:27,123 --> 00:45:28,889
        nationwide with         
    drowning investigations     

859
00:45:28,891 --> 00:45:30,257
     for the past 20 years.     

860
00:45:30,259 --> 00:45:32,193
       Zaferes got in the       
       spa while Strunsky       

861
00:45:32,195 --> 00:45:34,862
    videotaped from the spot    
  where Lindsay was watching.   

862
00:45:34,864 --> 00:45:38,699
   From the center of the pool  
 and towards where Lindsay was  

863
00:45:38,701 --> 00:45:41,101
    standing, anywhere I was    
    laying, you could not be    

864
00:45:41,103 --> 00:45:42,436
 seen from Lindsay's viewpoint. 

865
00:45:42,438 --> 00:45:44,738
    So once I sank below the    
  surface and hit that bottom,  

866
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:48,008
    you cannot see me at all    
   from Lindsay's viewpoint.    

867
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:50,644
KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): And 
 now the prosecutor was ready.  

868
00:45:50,646 --> 00:45:54,782
  In May 2011, one year after   
   the first jury deadlocked,   

869
00:45:54,784 --> 00:45:56,450
         Burke Strunsky         
       went back to court       

870
00:45:56,452 --> 00:45:59,053
  armed with his new evidence   
     for a brand-new panel      

871
00:45:59,055 --> 00:46:00,688
        of Hall's peers.        

872
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:03,324
  Jurors heard medical experts  
   testify about the injuries   

873
00:46:03,326 --> 00:46:05,226
        to Cristi's head        
        and, once again,        

874
00:46:05,228 --> 00:46:06,827
   heard Lindsay's 911 call.    

875
00:46:10,533 --> 00:46:13,868
  Cristi's coworkers testified  
      for the prosecution.      

876
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:16,871
   And Jerry Winkle traveled    
   from Idaho to tell jurors    

877
00:46:16,873 --> 00:46:19,240
 what he thought of Chris Hall. 

878
00:46:19,242 --> 00:46:23,410
   I was ashamed to admit that  
 he was once a police officer.  

879
00:46:23,412 --> 00:46:25,379
KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): But 
  if the prosecution had upped  

880
00:46:25,381 --> 00:46:29,350
its game in the year between the
two trials, so had the defense. 

881
00:46:29,352 --> 00:46:31,151
     That's when well-known     
     attorneys Steve Harmon     

882
00:46:31,153 --> 00:46:33,120
         and Paul Grech         
       entered the scene,       

883
00:46:33,122 --> 00:46:35,256
  and they came out swinging.   

884
00:46:35,258 --> 00:46:38,259
   That story about Cristi's    
      affair, for example?      

885
00:46:38,261 --> 00:46:41,762
    There's a shadow hanging    
    over all of this stuff--    

886
00:46:41,764 --> 00:46:48,202
    um, a very human sort of    
 shadow-- which is that she was 

887
00:46:48,204 --> 00:46:50,171
 having a little affair, right? 

888
00:46:50,173 --> 00:46:51,272
        Had a boyfriend.        

889
00:46:51,274 --> 00:46:54,975
       Yes, if the husband      
         knew about it.         

890
00:46:54,977 --> 00:46:58,846
      But the wife never,       
        ever mentions it        

891
00:46:58,848 --> 00:47:00,080
     and tells the husband.     

892
00:47:00,082 --> 00:47:01,615
   No one tells the husband.    

893
00:47:01,617 --> 00:47:03,450
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
  Quite right, said the judge.  

894
00:47:03,452 --> 00:47:04,852
       And because there        
        was no evidence         

895
00:47:04,854 --> 00:47:06,754
     that Chris knew about      
       his wife's affair,       

896
00:47:06,756 --> 00:47:09,123
 he ruled it out of the trial.  

897
00:47:09,125 --> 00:47:10,724
      The story about Hall      
        shooting himself        

898
00:47:10,726 --> 00:47:12,326
    for retirement benefits?    

899
00:47:12,328 --> 00:47:14,595
          That was just         
       absolutely a lie.        

900
00:47:14,597 --> 00:47:15,763
         That's wrong.          

901
00:47:15,765 --> 00:47:18,666
        There was never,        
      never any evidence,       

902
00:47:18,668 --> 00:47:21,435
       or indication, or        
      not even a moment's       

903
00:47:21,437 --> 00:47:24,104
  breath that he shot himself.  

904
00:47:24,106 --> 00:47:25,272
         KEITH MORRISON         
      (VOICEOVER): Anyway,      

905
00:47:25,274 --> 00:47:27,241
   the story was prejudicial,   
        said the judge,         

906
00:47:27,243 --> 00:47:30,110
   so he threw that out too.    

907
00:47:30,112 --> 00:47:32,279
      As for what Lindsay       
    Patterson says she saw--    

908
00:47:32,281 --> 00:47:35,316
     Chris Hall holding his     
    wife's head underwater--    

909
00:47:35,318 --> 00:47:38,385
  the defense had prepared its  
   own visual demonstration,    

910
00:47:38,387 --> 00:47:41,388
    had taken pictures from     
     her angle at the wall,     

911
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:43,624
        to show that it         
      could look like two       

912
00:47:43,626 --> 00:47:47,895
  people were touching in the   
   spa even if they weren't.    

913
00:47:47,897 --> 00:47:49,997
   This is what she described   
    seeing in her testimony.    

914
00:47:49,999 --> 00:47:51,198
               OK.              

915
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,433
       But on the closeup,      
      what do you notice?       

916
00:47:52,435 --> 00:47:53,634
        KEITH MORRISON:         
      They're not touching      

917
00:47:53,636 --> 00:47:55,703
    but they're in position     
      where they could be.      

918
00:47:55,705 --> 00:47:57,371
      But that's different      
    than actually touching.     

919
00:47:57,373 --> 00:47:58,773
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
        Again, the Hall         

920
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:01,175
         daughters were         
      there every minute,       

921
00:48:01,177 --> 00:48:03,677
         their father's         
      enduring champions.       

922
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:06,280
   And this time, more family   
     members came to court.     

923
00:48:06,282 --> 00:48:10,684
  Two of Cristi's own siblings  
      testified for Chris.      

924
00:48:10,686 --> 00:48:12,520
    And said the same thing--   

925
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:15,623
     we have not a doubt in     
    our minds that this was,    

926
00:48:15,625 --> 00:48:16,590
 uh, not a moment of violence.  

927
00:48:16,592 --> 00:48:17,591
KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): Mm. 

928
00:48:17,593 --> 00:48:18,893
     This was not a murder.     

929
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:22,763
     The-- the victim's own     
    sister and own brother.     

930
00:48:22,765 --> 00:48:24,732
That's an amazing thing to see. 

931
00:48:24,734 --> 00:48:26,133
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
        Perhaps it was.         

932
00:48:26,135 --> 00:48:27,735
      But listen to this.       

933
00:48:27,737 --> 00:48:31,772
 The defense had one more very  
 significant witness, a witness 

934
00:48:31,774 --> 00:48:34,141
    who oozed credibility--     

935
00:48:34,143 --> 00:48:37,645
  the sitting medical examiner  
from neighboring San Bernardino 

936
00:48:37,647 --> 00:48:43,050
   County, who stuck his neck   
 way out to disagree publicly,  

937
00:48:43,052 --> 00:48:45,386
    in a court of law, with     
      the medical examiner      

938
00:48:45,388 --> 00:48:47,054
        from Riverside.         

939
00:48:47,056 --> 00:48:49,490
       He found this to be      
    an accidental death, not    

940
00:48:49,492 --> 00:48:51,058
          a homicide.           

941
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,259
         KEITH MORRISON         
     (VOICEOVER): This was      

942
00:48:52,261 --> 00:48:53,761
  not some ordinary hired gun.  

943
00:48:53,763 --> 00:48:56,564
 This was a public official who 
said straight out that Cristi's 

944
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:59,467
    head injuries could and     
  perhaps should be explained   

945
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:01,836
     by an accidental fall.     

946
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:03,571
       He didn't rule out       
       homicide, though?        

947
00:49:03,573 --> 00:49:05,172
  He didn't rule out homicide.  

948
00:49:05,174 --> 00:49:08,509
        But he said the         
 preponderance of the evidence  

949
00:49:08,511 --> 00:49:11,445
         was towards an         
      accidental drowning.      

950
00:49:11,447 --> 00:49:14,348
    What I've-- I've always     
    been astounded by this--    

951
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:17,385
   with this case is that the   
   Hall family lives so close   

952
00:49:17,387 --> 00:49:22,456
 to the San Bernardino border,  
 if Cristi had slipped and fell 

953
00:49:22,458 --> 00:49:25,893
      four or five blocks       
     over, the pathologist      

954
00:49:25,895 --> 00:49:29,397
   in that county would never   
  have filed criminal charges.  

955
00:49:29,399 --> 00:49:31,165
   An accident of geography.    

956
00:49:31,167 --> 00:49:32,733
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
      So now a second jury      

957
00:49:32,735 --> 00:49:35,469
   would have to sort through   
 these two sets of allegations, 

958
00:49:35,471 --> 00:49:39,173
 these two opposing realities,  
    and decide whether Chris    

959
00:49:39,175 --> 00:49:41,742
      Hall would turn and       
  embrace home and his loving   

960
00:49:41,744 --> 00:49:46,747
     daughters or a pair of     
handcuffs and a life in prison. 

961
00:49:46,749 --> 00:49:48,182
   CRAIG MELVIN (VOICEOVER):    
       "Dateline" returns       

962
00:49:48,184 --> 00:49:48,950
        after the break.        

963
00:51:40,095 --> 00:51:41,362
       It's just a cough.       

964
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,131
          Yeah right.           
     And the earth is flat.     

965
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,500
             Ahhh!!             

966
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:48,102
   Treat your cough seriously   
    with Robitussin CF Max.     

967
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:49,537
      Nothing lasts longer      

968
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,473
  and treats more symptoms for  
   your cough, cold and flu.    

969
00:51:51,541 --> 00:53:06,848
      Robitussin. Because       
    it's never just a cough.    

970
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:10,285
         Welcome back.          

971
00:53:10,287 --> 00:53:13,021
    Chris Hall's first trial    
  ended in a deadlocked jury.   

972
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,690
     But with new evidence      
    presented by both sides     

973
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:18,794
      during his retrial,       
      the jury was finally      

974
00:53:18,796 --> 00:53:20,862
    able to reach a verdict.    

975
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:25,367
Now, with the conclusion to our 
 story, here's Keith Morrison.  

976
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:27,636
         KEITH MORRISON         
     (VOICEOVER): May 2011.     

977
00:53:27,638 --> 00:53:30,939
  For the second time, 12 men   
 and women of Riverside County, 

978
00:53:30,941 --> 00:53:33,675
      California filed out      
       of the courtroom--       

979
00:53:33,677 --> 00:53:37,980
  a second jury to make a life  
   decision about Chris Hall.   

980
00:53:37,982 --> 00:53:40,048
    Did he murder his wife?     

981
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,751
      Which of the medical      
 examiners should they believe? 

982
00:53:42,753 --> 00:53:45,587
      Whose account of the      
     defendant's character?     

983
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:47,823
       And, perhaps most        
        important, what         

984
00:53:47,825 --> 00:53:51,293
   did Lindsay Patterson see    
  when she peeked three times   

985
00:53:51,295 --> 00:53:53,228
   into the Hall's backyard?    

986
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:57,633
 Do you ever have those sort of 
little dark moments of the soul 

987
00:53:57,635 --> 00:54:03,238
  where you think, I may have   
 misinterpreted, misremembered? 

988
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,275
     That is something I've     
    thought about every day,    

989
00:54:06,277 --> 00:54:08,844
   whether I misinterpreted,    
     whether I think I saw      

990
00:54:08,846 --> 00:54:10,479
  something that wasn't there.  

991
00:54:10,481 --> 00:54:12,481
    I didn't see everything.    

992
00:54:12,483 --> 00:54:13,649
              Yeah?             

993
00:54:13,651 --> 00:54:15,084
      But I saw what I saw.     

994
00:54:15,086 --> 00:54:18,988
         And I know the         
    conclusion of my story.     

995
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:19,788
           I know it.           

996
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:21,023
     I know it right here.      

997
00:54:21,025 --> 00:54:22,558
           I know it.           

998
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:23,859
 KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): Of 
 course, Chris Hall's daughters 

999
00:54:23,861 --> 00:54:25,261
 say they know the truth too--  

1000
00:54:25,263 --> 00:54:29,164
  real thing in their hearts.   

1001
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:32,001
    I think that we were the    
   three most critical jurors   

1002
00:54:32,003 --> 00:54:35,171
       in that courtroom.       

1003
00:54:35,173 --> 00:54:40,409
  Believe me, if we had heard   
  anything or had any inkling   

1004
00:54:40,411 --> 00:54:45,481
that our father could have done 
 this, as much as it would hurt 

1005
00:54:45,483 --> 00:54:47,550
       and as much as we        
        love our father,        

1006
00:54:47,552 --> 00:54:49,752
     we would want justice      
        for our mother.         

1007
00:54:49,754 --> 00:54:51,721
KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER): The 
  jurors deliberated two days,  

1008
00:54:51,723 --> 00:54:54,156
then broke for the long weekend.

1009
00:54:54,158 --> 00:54:56,559
      It was Memorial Day.      

1010
00:54:56,561 --> 00:54:58,861
  Hall's daughters felt good.   

1011
00:54:58,863 --> 00:55:01,931
       Things can only go       
      so wrong for so long      

1012
00:55:01,933 --> 00:55:04,900
        before something        
       has to actually--        

1013
00:55:04,902 --> 00:55:05,735
   KEITH MORRISON: Go right.    

1014
00:55:05,737 --> 00:55:07,203
       --go right for us.       

1015
00:55:07,205 --> 00:55:10,273
  We just did a lot of talking  
   about the future and this,   

1016
00:55:10,275 --> 00:55:14,010
     you know, being over,      
      this being finished.      

1017
00:55:14,012 --> 00:55:19,482
      And honestly, I was       
  concerned about dad and how   

1018
00:55:19,484 --> 00:55:21,651
      he was finally going      
      to be able to grieve      

1019
00:55:21,653 --> 00:55:22,852
   for the loss of his wife.    

1020
00:55:22,854 --> 00:55:24,053
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
        And then it was         

1021
00:55:24,055 --> 00:55:26,355
 Tuesday, 8:45 in the morning.  

1022
00:55:26,357 --> 00:55:28,424
       The jury gathered.       

1023
00:55:28,426 --> 00:55:32,061
      And minutes later, a      
    signal they were ready.     

1024
00:55:32,063 --> 00:55:34,497
       Chris Hall and his       
   daughters rushed to court.   

1025
00:55:34,499 --> 00:55:37,500
       And in the end, it       
        was very quick--        

1026
00:55:37,502 --> 00:55:40,603
 guilty of first-degree murder. 

1027
00:55:40,605 --> 00:55:45,108
   Their father would not be    
  coming home, probably ever.   

1028
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:49,779
      He's being cuffed and     
 potentially put away for life. 

1029
00:55:49,781 --> 00:55:54,117
      And yeah, it hurts.       

1030
00:55:54,119 --> 00:55:56,586
  And we are angry about that.  

1031
00:55:56,588 --> 00:55:59,355
       You can still hear       
       those daughters--        

1032
00:55:59,357 --> 00:56:00,690
             I can.             

1033
00:56:00,692 --> 00:56:03,393
   --accusing you of unfairly   
    convicting their father.    

1034
00:56:03,395 --> 00:56:04,461
           Absolutely.          

1035
00:56:04,463 --> 00:56:05,895
        It weighs on me.        

1036
00:56:05,897 --> 00:56:09,299
  But at the same time, I know  
   who I'm dealing with when    

1037
00:56:09,301 --> 00:56:10,800
    it comes to Chris Hall.     

1038
00:56:10,802 --> 00:56:14,404
  In fact, he's the one that's  
 stolen their mother from them. 

1039
00:56:14,406 --> 00:56:16,239
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
  It had been a peculiar fact   

1040
00:56:16,241 --> 00:56:18,775
 of this case that the victims' 
    and defendants' families    

1041
00:56:18,777 --> 00:56:22,512
   had stood solidly together   
    against the prosecution.    

1042
00:56:22,514 --> 00:56:26,716
  But what no one knew was the  
  truth was more complicated.   

1043
00:56:26,718 --> 00:56:28,585
     After the verdict, at      
    Chris Hall's sentencing,    

1044
00:56:28,587 --> 00:56:30,086
    a letter was introduced.    

1045
00:56:30,088 --> 00:56:33,523
     It was from another of     
 Cristi Hall's brothers, Billy  

1046
00:56:33,525 --> 00:56:36,860
      Carlton, who, until       
       now, had said not        

1047
00:56:36,862 --> 00:56:39,429
one public word about the case. 

1048
00:56:39,431 --> 00:56:42,165
"We would like to ask His Honor 
   for the maximum sentence,"   

1049
00:56:42,167 --> 00:56:43,667
          wrote Billy.          

1050
00:56:43,669 --> 00:56:46,002
  "The pain that my family has  
 suffered through this tragedy  

1051
00:56:46,004 --> 00:56:47,871
       is unforgivable."        

1052
00:56:47,873 --> 00:56:49,239
        And I didn't want       
       to hurt the girls.       

1053
00:56:49,241 --> 00:56:50,907
       I had to say what        
        was on my mind.         

1054
00:56:50,909 --> 00:56:52,609
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
    There was a deep divide     

1055
00:56:52,611 --> 00:56:54,878
in Cristi's family, said Billy. 

1056
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:58,015
     Some of her relatives      
  believed Chris was innocent.  

1057
00:56:58,017 --> 00:57:00,617
      But he and, he says,      
       others, including        

1058
00:57:00,619 --> 00:57:03,287
      Cristi's uncle Steve      
        Mundie, silently        

1059
00:57:03,289 --> 00:57:05,055
    urged on the prosecutor.    

1060
00:57:05,057 --> 00:57:07,224
         Half the family        
        was convinced he        

1061
00:57:07,226 --> 00:57:10,828
   was innocent and half the    
family was convinced he wasn't. 

1062
00:57:10,830 --> 00:57:12,729
     And that's hard to do      
   when you have a big family   

1063
00:57:12,731 --> 00:57:15,766
     and you all have to be     
together every once in a while. 

1064
00:57:15,768 --> 00:57:19,937
     And when it involves a     
 member as loved as Cristi was. 

1065
00:57:19,939 --> 00:57:21,438
            Exactly.            

1066
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:24,241
        Does that explain       
     why this kind of group     

1067
00:57:24,243 --> 00:57:26,176
        of people in the        
      family decided just       

1068
00:57:26,178 --> 00:57:29,747
to let justice take its course? 

1069
00:57:29,749 --> 00:57:30,981
          We had talked         
     about it quite a bit.      

1070
00:57:30,983 --> 00:57:32,483
           I think so.          

1071
00:57:32,485 --> 00:57:34,418
   And you've got to know when  
 to show up sometimes and when  

1072
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:38,455
  not to show up, just to keep  
   what's left of the family    

1073
00:57:38,457 --> 00:57:41,091
as together as you can have it. 

1074
00:57:41,093 --> 00:57:42,393
  Thank you so much for coming. 

1075
00:57:42,395 --> 00:57:43,661
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
       When it was over,        

1076
00:57:43,663 --> 00:57:46,630
       Hall convicted and       
     sentenced to 25 years      

1077
00:57:46,632 --> 00:57:48,899
        to life, some of        
       Cristi's relatives       

1078
00:57:48,901 --> 00:57:52,036
      met with Prosecutor       
   Strunsky and thanked him.    

1079
00:57:52,038 --> 00:57:56,741
     They wanted me to thank    
    you for putting that guy    

1080
00:57:56,743 --> 00:57:59,810
 away, because he's a murderer. 

1081
00:57:59,812 --> 00:58:01,846
  KEITH MORRISON (VOICEOVER):   
    And the Hall daughters?     

1082
00:58:01,848 --> 00:58:05,449
   Having lost their beloved    
mother, fought to save a father 

1083
00:58:05,451 --> 00:58:07,885
          they adored.          

1084
00:58:07,887 --> 00:58:09,453
     COURTNEY HALL: It's a      
      devastating reality.      

1085
00:58:09,455 --> 00:58:13,925
    It really is, especially    
         for our family         

1086
00:58:13,927 --> 00:58:17,261
that-- now, to say that we were 
  close is an understatement,   

1087
00:58:17,263 --> 00:58:18,462
           you know?            

1088
00:58:18,464 --> 00:58:21,866
    To go from that to being    
      not able to be there      

1089
00:58:21,868 --> 00:58:23,801
  with each other, it's, uh--   

1090
00:58:26,706 --> 00:58:28,339
       it's the greatest        
     heartbreak that anyone     

1091
00:58:28,341 --> 00:58:29,607
 can ever experience, I think.  

1092
