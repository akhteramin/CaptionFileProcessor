00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:26,271
YOU CAN SAY HE'S A GOOD-LOOKING 
GUY, BUT BEING A GOOD-LOOKING   

114
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:26,872
GUY, BUT BEING A GOOD-LOOKING   
GUY IS THE REASON HE GOT AWAY   

115
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:27,806
GUY IS THE REASON HE GOT AWAY   
WITH WHAT HE WAS DOING FOR SO   

116
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:31,877
WITH WHAT HE WAS DOING FOR SO   
LONG.

POSSIBLE.                       

121
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:46,391
POSSIBLE.                       
IT WAS MADE SO PEOPLE CAN BE    

122
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:46,992
IT WAS MADE SO PEOPLE CAN BE    
AWARE THAT THERE IS MORE THAN   

123
00:03:46,994 --> 00:03:51,596
AWARE THAT THERE IS MORE THAN   
ONE LOOK TO A SERIAL KILLER.    

124
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:52,230
ONE LOOK TO A SERIAL KILLER.    
>> YEAH, AND I THINK THAT'S WHY 

125
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,766
>> YEAH, AND I THINK THAT'S WHY 
ASIDE FROM HIM USING THAT AT THE

126
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:55,333
ASIDE FROM HIM USING THAT AT THE
TIME, WE HADN'T SEEN SERIAL     

127
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:55,901
TIME, WE HADN'T SEEN SERIAL     
KILLERS AT ALL, AND PEOPLE      

128
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:56,868
KILLERS AT ALL, AND PEOPLE      
AUTOMATICALLY ASSOCIATED A

CERTAIN LOOK WITH WHAT A        

130
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,471
CERTAIN LOOK WITH WHAT A        
CRIMINAL WAS.                   

131
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:01,006
CRIMINAL WAS.                   
SO WITHOUT THIS ELEMENT OF THE  

132
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:02,207
SO WITHOUT THIS ELEMENT OF THE  
STORY, YOU WOULD BE BETRAYING
