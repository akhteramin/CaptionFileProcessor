01:16:59,349 --> 01:17:03,150
      would keep us apart.      

2056
01:17:03,186 --> 01:17:05,319
    So I talked to my doctor    
         about HUMIRA.          

2057
01:17:05,355 --> 01:17:06,721
 I learned HUMIRA can help get,

      worked well enough.       

2060
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:12,994
  And it helps people achieve   
      control that lasts.       

2061
01:17:13,029 --> 01:17:14,228
