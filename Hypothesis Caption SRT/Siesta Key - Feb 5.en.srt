     that's involved in it.     

2
00:00:02,303 --> 00:00:04,670
   This is a rough business,    
     you know, in Mykonos,      

3
00:00:04,739 --> 00:00:06,271
 and it's only getting busier,  

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,041
  so I really don't have time   
   to take any weak links in.   

5
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,909
         I don't know.

9
00:00:22,156 --> 00:00:24,623
        We decided to send you  
        to see your grandmother.

14
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:33,299
I have a brand

15
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:34,867

have to let you go.             

16
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:38,370
           (Juliette)           
    Lately, my relationship     

17
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:40,172
     with Chloe has gotten      
        pretty tense...         

18
00:00:40,241 --> 00:00:41,740
Stop                            
           Don't push me, honey.

19
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:43,342
     Don't put your hands on me.

00:00:43,411 --> 00:00:46,946
           (Juliette)           
    ...and it's all because     
       of Alex's ex Cara.       

21
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:51,584
Cara's definitely               
his kryptonite.                 

22
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:53,586
he would come over              
if I asked him to.              

23
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:54,787

24
00:00:54,856 --> 00:00:56,555

            exchange numbers.   

25
00:00:56,624 --> 00:00:58,090
           (Juliette)           
      Garrett's so naive,       

26
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:00,326
   he actually thinks he has    
        a shot with her.        

27
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,294
             You look beautiful.
Thank you.

29
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:06,966

      her usual hot mess.       

30

the whole boyfriend?            

31
00:01:08,436 --> 00:01:10,069

           (Juliette)           
          But Kelsey's          
       commitment issues        

33
00:01:12,106 --> 00:01:14,407
      are nothing compared      
         to Madisson's.         

34
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:15,508
So what's the deal              
with you guys?                  

35
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,543
    We're both like, single.

       was so much better       
     than any of theirs...

00:04:18,393 --> 00:04:21,027
           (Juliette)           
     And now she's talking      
       to my ex Garrett.        

109
00:04:21,096 --> 00:04:22,162
I'm really not                  
posting that.                   

110
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,997
            It's a good picture,
            though, why not?    

111
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:25,799
              Second date?      
              It's far too soon.

112
00:04:25,867 --> 00:04:27,333
Story?                          
              No.               

113
00:04:27,402 --> 00:04:29,469
Maybe put like, you know,       
"Chillin' in paradise"          

114
00:04:29,538 --> 00:04:31,671
with a little                   
palm tree emoji.                

115
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,039
              Stories get people
              in trouble.       

116
00:04:33,108 --> 00:04:35,342
                Did you see, um,
                Kelsey and Jared

117
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,410
        hung out the other night
        on Jared's story?       

118
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:40,013
Oh, yeah, I did.                
                 They were like,
                 skinny-dipping.

119
00:04:40,082 --> 00:04:42,415
Isn't she worried               
her boyfriend might see that?   

120
00:04:42,484 --> 00:04:43,883
                 That's awkward.

121
00:04:43,952 --> 00:04:46,252
      Yeah, so I'm definitely   
      not gonna story this then.

122
00:04:46,321 --> 00:04:47,420
You know who that would         
probably piss off?              

123
00:04:47,489 --> 00:04:48,989
                          Who?  
 Juliette.                      

124
00:04:49,057 --> 00:04:52,959
     All these exes of yours    
     that I have to worry about.

125
00:04:53,028 --> 00:04:54,861
No, second date,                
it's already been               

126
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,196
better than any date            
I've been on with Juliette.     

127
00:04:56,265 --> 00:04:59,199
           Aww, that's so sweet,
           thank you.           

128
00:04:59,268 --> 00:05:01,034

129
00:05:01,103 --> 00:05:02,936
You got it.                     
                      All right,

130
00:05:03,005 --> 00:05:04,404
          why am I a better date
          than Juliette?        

131
00:05:04,473 --> 00:05:06,940
Um, you're                      
a lot more sweeter.             

132
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:08,642
                     Oh, really?
Yeah.                           

133
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:09,943
She's like, said                
a bunch of stuff                

134
00:05:10,012 --> 00:05:13,113
like you're still trying        
to get with Alex.               

135
00:05:13,182 --> 00:05:14,748
                            Eww.

136
00:05:14,816 --> 00:05:17,517
       She says anything she can
       to hate on me.           

137
00:05:17,586 --> 00:05:18,919
Well, is that like,             
not true?                       

138
00:05:18,987 --> 00:05:21,087
        I'm not impressed by him

139
00:05:21,156 --> 00:05:24,124
                like she is,    
                that's for sure.

140
00:05:24,193 --> 00:05:25,459
With the money and all that?    

141
00:05:25,527 --> 00:05:26,860
             Yeah, I mean, like,
             I've been around   

142
00:05:26,929 --> 00:05:28,261
            that kind of (bleep)
            my whole life.      

143
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,197
               Like, it's not   
               impressive to me.

144
00:05:30,265 --> 00:05:31,731
Like, for me,                   
I've always had                 

145
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,567
to work for everything          
that I've had.                  

146
00:05:33,635 --> 00:05:34,968
Like, growing up like,          

147
00:05:35,037 --> 00:05:37,204
my parents weren't like,        
wealthy or anything, but...     

148
00:05:37,272 --> 00:05:39,773
so I kinda grew up              
staying humble,                 

149
00:05:39,842 --> 00:05:42,008
but also having                 
somewhat success                

150
00:05:42,077 --> 00:05:44,778
just from hard work             
and all that.                   

151
00:05:44,847 --> 00:05:46,813
So what about you--             
                          Sorry.

152
00:05:46,882 --> 00:05:48,515
what're your plans              
for your future?                

153
00:05:48,584 --> 00:05:50,350
What do you wanna do?           
                          Plans?

154
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:52,853
Yeah, do you have any?          
       I applied to grad school.

155
00:05:52,921 --> 00:05:54,755
Oh, yeah?                       
             Yeah, for teaching.

156
00:05:54,823 --> 00:05:56,223
Like, what do you wanna teach?  

157
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,058
                   Kindergarten,
                   first grade, 
                   second grade?

158
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,360
Yeah?                           
             Yeah, I'm good with
             the little ones.

Bring the white pants.

178

Dude, I hate packing.

                You're not doing

          Oh, thanks!           

181
00:06:47,476 --> 00:06:52,045
Juliette specifically told me   
"Cara is not invited."          

182
00:06:52,114 --> 00:06:53,947
              Of course she did.
And I was like, I know.         

183
00:06:54,016 --> 00:06:56,049
And even though                 
I want you to come...           

184
00:06:56,118 --> 00:06:58,585
 Even though I want to come...  
         (all laughing)         

185
00:06:58,654 --> 00:07:01,221
            (Kelsey)            
      I wish I was going,       
        but I feel like         

186
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,556
  there's just gonna be drama   

187
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,057
     with all these rumors      
    going around and stuff.     

188
00:07:04,126 --> 00:07:07,094
        Like that Jared (bleep)?
Oh, my God.                     

189
00:07:07,163 --> 00:07:10,130
That Jared (bleep)              
is literally so stupid.         

190
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:12,166
                  What happened?
On the way home,                

191
00:07:12,234 --> 00:07:14,501
we decided to go                
to the beach                    
and that was it.                

192
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:15,669
Yes, we have chemistry,         

193
00:07:15,738 --> 00:07:17,905
but I have a boyfriend          
and I don't wanna ruin that.    

194
00:07:17,973 --> 00:07:19,339
             As long as you     
             and Jacob are good.

195
00:07:19,408 --> 00:07:20,574
        That's all that matters.
Yeah, we're great.              

196
00:07:20,643 --> 00:07:22,309
I'm very happy about it.        

197
00:07:23,312 --> 00:07:25,112
             (Alex)             
     We got white buffalo.      

198
00:07:25,181 --> 00:07:27,147
        Let's not do that again.
             Crazy.             

199
00:07:27,216 --> 00:07:28,849
        Let's not do that again?

200
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:30,818
    No, I don't wanna fight     
       with you anymore.        

201
00:07:30,886 --> 00:07:33,387
        No, I don't wanna fight,
        especially in public.   

202
00:07:33,456 --> 00:07:35,456
         Really?                
              Well, I don't like
              to do that.       

203
00:07:35,524 --> 00:07:37,057
          'Cause then everyone's
          like, "What's wrong?" 

204
00:07:37,126 --> 00:07:39,226
I don't wanna fight             
in general, that's...           

205
00:07:39,295 --> 00:07:41,762
  I mean, we're always gonna    
  get in like, little arguments.

206
00:07:41,831 --> 00:07:43,030
        (both giggling)         

207
00:07:45,034 --> 00:07:47,167
               Did you see Chloe
               apologized to me?

208
00:07:47,236 --> 00:07:49,270
          She seemed like she   
          really wanted to like,

209
00:07:49,338 --> 00:07:51,171
         rebuild our friendship,

210
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,740
              and she apologized
              about Cara        

211
00:07:52,808 --> 00:07:55,476
        and said that she was...
Yeah, she admitted to me...     

212
00:07:55,544 --> 00:07:57,077
          ...bringing her around
          to piss me off.       

213
00:07:57,146 --> 00:07:59,513
And I was like,                 
at least you admit it.          
                           Yeah.

214
00:07:59,582 --> 00:08:01,448
            (Chloe)             
I mean, Juliette and I obviously

215
00:08:01,517 --> 00:08:03,484
aren't like,                    
back to complete normal.        

216
00:08:03,553 --> 00:08:06,120
But hopefully in Miami,         
we can like,                    

217
00:08:06,189 --> 00:08:08,255
rekindle our friendship         
and like, remember why          

218
00:08:08,324 --> 00:08:09,823
we were all friends             
in the beginning.               

219
00:08:09,892 --> 00:08:12,760
      Yeah, I'm just sad,       
now I have to wait a whole week 

220
00:08:12,829 --> 00:08:14,562
   to see Garrett again.        

221
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,831
So what is going on             
with you and Garrett?           

222
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:18,566
            We've had two dates.

223
00:08:18,634 --> 00:08:20,234
Have you kissed?                
                        No.     

224
00:08:20,303 --> 00:08:22,036
                 We haven't done
                 anything yet.  

225
00:08:22,104 --> 00:08:24,872
Do you want to?                 
             I mean, eventually.

226
00:08:24,941 --> 00:08:26,740
        But not like, right now.

227
00:08:26,809 --> 00:08:29,643
I mean, half the fun            
of seeing Garrett               

228
00:08:29,712 --> 00:08:31,445
        is that he's always     
        around Alex and Juliette

229
00:08:31,514 --> 00:08:33,881
               and I know it    
               drives her crazy.

230
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,317
                  I'm kinda glad
                  I'm not going.

231
00:08:36,385 --> 00:08:38,219
          I wanna spend a little
          more time with Tawni. 

232
00:08:38,287 --> 00:08:40,421
What do you mean?               
             Yeah, what is...   

233
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,723
              So we definitely  
              have a connection.

234
00:08:42,792 --> 00:08:44,825
                We spend so much
                time together   

235
00:08:44,894 --> 00:08:46,360
  and we're very similar people.

236
00:08:46,429 --> 00:08:48,029
For sure.                       
        I've always liked Tawni,

237
00:08:48,097 --> 00:08:51,499
      so maybe I can inch my way
      into something else.      

238
00:08:51,567 --> 00:08:55,236
Really? Has she even            
ever been with a girl?          

239
00:08:55,304 --> 00:08:58,906
    No, but that's not something
    that I'm not familiar with. 

240
00:08:58,975 --> 00:09:00,241
(Chloe)                         
Yeah, I guess that's true.      

241
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:02,877
Well, I just don't want you     
falling for someone             

242
00:09:02,945 --> 00:09:04,945
that can't fall for you         
back the same way.              

243
00:09:05,014 --> 00:09:07,481
So just be careful.             

244
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,383
           (Madisson)           
     So guess who's coming?     

245
00:09:09,452 --> 00:09:12,320
Who?                            
               Ben decided to   
               meet us in Miami.

246
00:09:12,388 --> 00:09:13,454
Think you guys                  
are gonna talk about like,      

247
00:09:13,523 --> 00:09:14,922
where you stand                 
and all that, or...?            

248
00:09:14,991 --> 00:09:16,924
          I mean, it's something
          I'm dreading,         

249
00:09:16,993 --> 00:09:18,392
      but I know that I have to.
Mm-hmm.                         

250
00:09:18,461 --> 00:09:21,429
         Ben and I have been    
         doing this casual thing

251
00:09:21,497 --> 00:09:23,497
      for five or six years now.
Yeah.                           

252
00:09:23,566 --> 00:09:26,300
     Obviously like, I want that
     commitment from him...     

253
00:09:26,369 --> 00:09:27,668
Yeah.                           
        ...'cause it's just been

254
00:09:27,737 --> 00:09:29,337
                so surface level
                for so long.    

255
00:09:29,405 --> 00:09:30,838
I mean, it's up to you,         
but I really don't think        

256
00:09:30,907 --> 00:09:33,374
you should be with someone      
if they're not gonna be willing 

257
00:09:33,443 --> 00:09:35,042
to be with you                  
on a deeper level.              

258
00:09:38,248 --> 00:09:40,414
So Garrett                      
is five minutes out.            

259
00:09:40,483 --> 00:09:42,617
        Oh, perfect timing.     
        I thought I was rushing.

and I just let people in        

435
00:17:20,812 --> 00:17:23,179
because it's worth it           
to me to get hurt               

436
00:17:23,248 --> 00:17:25,615
to actually have a chance       
at something real.              

437
00:17:25,683 --> 00:17:27,984
              Yeah, see,        
              I think the reason

438
00:17:28,052 --> 00:17:29,952
           I'm so much like too 
           on top of everything,

439
00:17:30,021 --> 00:17:31,254
                 you know, like,
                 I don't have   

440
00:17:31,322 --> 00:17:32,555
       the greatest relationship
       with my dad.             

441
00:17:32,624 --> 00:17:33,923
      He completely abandoned me

442
00:17:33,992 --> 00:17:35,858
          and like,             
          refuses to talk to me.

443
00:17:35,927 --> 00:17:37,260
   I needed a mom at that point.

444
00:17:37,328 --> 00:17:39,262
             I needed someone to
             be able to talk to.

445
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:42,632
        And like, when I was 16,
        she moved to Australia. 

446
00:17:42,701 --> 00:17:46,135
I can't even imagine.           
                 I've needed her

447
00:17:46,204 --> 00:17:47,704
           in so many situations
           in my life,          

448
00:17:47,772 --> 00:17:49,205
             and phone calls    
             don't really do it.

449
00:17:49,274 --> 00:17:51,474
              I'll figure it out
              hopefully.        

450
00:17:51,543 --> 00:17:52,909
For sure.                       

451
00:17:54,379 --> 00:17:55,311
So I can maybe understand       

452
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,980
your jaded opinion              
on love a little bit.           

453
00:17:57,048 --> 00:17:59,382
               Yeah, you know...
What would be                   
your ideal girl?                

454
00:18:01,853 --> 00:18:03,853
            I need someone who  
            can keep up with me.

455
00:18:03,922 --> 00:18:05,488
          I need someone who can
          keep up with my mouth.

456
00:18:05,557 --> 00:18:07,190
            And like,           
            I like broken souls.

457
00:18:07,258 --> 00:18:08,658
         And just say (bleep) it
         right now,             

458
00:18:08,727 --> 00:18:11,327

00:18:31,483 --> 00:18:33,816
         and we're all

(Brandon)                       
Hey, why didn't Madisson come?  

471
00:18:37,155 --> 00:18:39,155
         She was like,          
     exhausted today, so...

Yeah, I know, it's Miami.       

475
00:18:43,795 --> 00:18:46,262
You came out here               
from Texas, (bleep).            

476
00:18:46,331 --> 00:18:47,363
Oh, well.                       

477
00:18:47,432 --> 00:18:49,199

479
00:18:50,669 --> 00:18:52,469
       then I'm staying with her
       in the same room.        

480
00:18:52,537 --> 00:18:53,703
               Like, I feel like
               you deserve that 

481
00:18:53,772 --> 00:18:55,338
        as a-- as a man, like...
Yeah.

483
00:18:57,509 --> 00:18:59,209
        But that's what         
      I'm saying, though,       

484
00:18:59,277 --> 00:19:01,177
   it's cool that she's like,   
   letting you out right now.

486
00:19:06,852 --> 00:19:08,852
So you took Cara out,           
she told me.                    

487
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,620
                    I did, yeah.
How'd it go?                    

488
00:19:10,689 --> 00:19:11,955
            It went really good,
            I thought.          

489
00:19:12,023 --> 00:19:14,391
      She's cool.               
      She's-- she's a cool girl.

490
00:19:14,459 --> 00:19:15,859
So you like her.                

491
00:19:15,927 --> 00:19:18,795
           I'm trying to get her
           to come here.        

492
00:19:18,864 --> 00:19:21,898
           I'm probably gonna...
I don't think                   
that's a good idea.             

493
00:19:21,967 --> 00:19:23,199
          ...maybe FaceTime her.

494
00:19:23,268 --> 00:19:24,934
               I still wanna get
               to know her more,

495
00:19:25,003 --> 00:19:27,203
        and I think like,       
        her coming to visit here

496
00:19:27,272 --> 00:19:29,172
      and stay in Miami would be
      a good opportunity for us 

497
00:19:29,241 --> 00:19:31,975
      to have like, a good time.

498
00:19:32,044 --> 00:19:33,510
That puts me in                 
a bad position.                 

499
00:19:33,578 --> 00:19:35,578
I just wanna be                 
a good friend                   
to Juliette.                    

500
00:19:35,647 --> 00:19:38,982
         I mean, you guys all   
         just sorted things out.

501
00:19:39,051 --> 00:19:40,984
         So you guys are good...
And one of the major rules      

502
00:19:41,053 --> 00:19:43,853
is "Chloe,                      
don't bring Cara around."

around Juliette,                

504
00:19:45,824 --> 00:19:48,358
just don't be around            
Cara at the same time.          

505
00:19:48,427 --> 00:19:49,960
        It's not gonna be       
        Chloe bringing her here,

506
00:19:50,028 --> 00:19:52,095
           it's gonna be Garrett
           bringing her here.   

507
00:19:52,164 --> 00:19:53,530
             Uh, so I think     
             it'll be all right.

508
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:55,899

00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:58,722
        Is Cara coming?         

542
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:00,724
           (Brandon)            
  He said Cara's coming, yeah.  

543
00:22:00,793 --> 00:22:02,359
           (Juliette)           
       The only question        
       was who to blame?        

544
00:22:02,428 --> 00:22:05,562
                 Don't be upset.
     I'm just like...           

545
00:22:05,631 --> 00:22:07,631
        No one knew it was      
        happening until tonight.

546
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,766
You probably did, Chloe.        

547
00:22:08,834 --> 00:22:10,167
                   I didn't, no.

548
00:22:10,236 --> 00:22:11,769
               Garrett just     
               asked me tonight,

549
00:22:11,837 --> 00:22:13,604
  it was so (bleep) annoying.   

550
00:22:13,672 --> 00:22:15,072
Why do you give a (bleep)?      

551
00:22:15,141 --> 00:22:16,540
Like, clearly                   
I didn't invite her.            

552
00:22:16,609 --> 00:22:18,075
         (Chloe)                
         No one's attacking you.

553
00:22:18,144 --> 00:22:20,344
    Yeah, stop attacking.       
      Don't attack her about it.

554
00:22:20,413 --> 00:22:22,579
               Whoa, whoa, whoa,
               whoa, whoa.      

555
00:22:22,648 --> 00:22:23,814
Why do you care?                

556
00:22:23,883 --> 00:22:26,784
            Why wouldn't I care?

557
00:22:26,852 --> 00:22:28,319
                It's just weird.

558
00:22:28,387 --> 00:22:29,620
             (Chloe)            
             No one invited her.

559
00:22:29,689 --> 00:22:31,255
         It's annoying.         

560
00:22:32,758 --> 00:22:34,425
          (Brandon)             
          Garrett's not thinking
          about Juliette,       

561
00:22:34,493 --> 00:22:35,826
   Garrett's thinking about him.
      This trip is for her.     

562
00:22:35,895 --> 00:22:37,094
It's up to Juliette.            

563
00:22:37,163 --> 00:22:38,062
I think Garrett shouldn't       
be (bleep) Cara.                

564
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:39,296
Garrett can do                  
a lot better.                   

565
00:22:39,365 --> 00:22:40,798
No offense, I know              
you're friends with her.        

566
00:22:40,866 --> 00:22:42,600
      But I didn't invite her,  
      so I have nothing to do...

567
00:22:42,668 --> 00:22:44,268
            (Amanda)            
      No, I'm just saying,      
        I don't mind her        

568
00:22:44,337 --> 00:22:46,770
it's just I know she pisses     
one of my best friends off.     

569
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:49,106
        What a desperate person.

570
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,443
          Hi, Garrett.          

571
00:22:52,511 --> 00:22:53,811
                      Yo, homie.

572
00:22:58,818 --> 00:23:02,419
Why would you invite            
Cara here?                      

573
00:23:02,488 --> 00:23:05,256
           Uh, I'm trying to get
           to know her better.  

574
00:23:05,324 --> 00:23:08,759
So you should go                
know her better in Sarasota.    

575
00:23:12,965 --> 00:23:14,298
                Where you going,
                Juliette?       

576
00:23:14,367 --> 00:23:16,333
It's just like,                 
you should just                 
use common sense                

577
00:23:16,402 --> 00:23:17,535
that it's like,                 
incredibly rude.                

578
00:23:17,603 --> 00:23:20,137
          I told him.           
          I told him.           

579
00:23:20,206 --> 00:23:22,673
If you wanna invite             
my boyfriend's ex               

580
00:23:22,742 --> 00:23:24,909
who's probably still trying     
to hook up with him,            

581
00:23:24,977 --> 00:23:27,478
don't come on my trip.          

582
00:23:27,547 --> 00:23:29,113
You can go,                     
you can leave.                  

583
00:23:29,182 --> 00:23:30,681
go to a different hotel.        

584
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,049
             (Alex)             
            Baby...             

585
00:23:32,118 --> 00:23:34,385
That's literally                
so (bleep) rude.                

586
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,157
           (Juliette)           
          Coming up...          

587
00:23:40,226 --> 00:23:41,559
             So you can sit here
             and tell me that   

588
00:23:41,627 --> 00:23:43,561
         you don't think we have
         any chemistry together?

589
00:23:43,629 --> 00:23:45,029

to come in town,                

590

616
00:27:18,412 --> 00:27:20,278

620
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:27,419
    what Kelsey's boyfriend     
   would say if he found out.

              So how are things?

622
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,690
Kelsey's meeting me here        
to talk.                        

623
00:27:31,758 --> 00:27:34,192
                          Ahem. 
Yikes.                          

624
00:27:34,261 --> 00:27:37,062
     You sound like you're about
     to have a fun conversation.

625
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:39,498
Probably.                       
It's okay.                      

626
00:27:39,566 --> 00:27:40,866
                 Well, you know,
                 I'm always here

627
00:27:40,934 --> 00:27:43,201
                to get you drunk
                afterwards.     

628
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,469
           Or get you drunk now.

629
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:46,538
Thank you.                      
                           Yeah.

630
00:27:46,607 --> 00:27:49,508
                    Speaking of,
                    I had a very

631
00:27:49,576 --> 00:27:51,443
               interesting night
               the other night. 

632
00:27:51,512 --> 00:27:54,679
With whom?                      
                     With Tawni.

633
00:27:54,748 --> 00:27:56,081
So that's a thing.              

634
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:58,717
        Um, I don't know if it's
        a thing exactly yet.    

635
00:27:58,786 --> 00:28:00,152
           Hopefully, we'll see.

636
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,254
I want the dirty deets.         
I want all of it.               

637
00:28:02,322 --> 00:28:05,390
Juicy details.                  
Fill me up.                     

638
00:28:05,459 --> 00:28:07,426
       You know me and Tawni,   
       so you know it gets wild.

639
00:28:07,494 --> 00:28:10,429
                Dirty dancing,  
                and other things

640
00:28:10,497 --> 00:28:12,898
                  happened after
                  dirty dancing.

641
00:28:12,966 --> 00:28:16,601
So if I played baseball,        
was it a home run, or...        

642
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:18,570
             I mean,            
             a lady never tells.

643
00:28:18,639 --> 00:28:21,440
Enjoy your secrets.             
I'll assume what I want.        

644
00:28:22,876 --> 00:28:24,509
So you think it's gonna         
go somewhere or is it...        

645
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,578
                     I think so.

            (Ben)               
            Last night I was out
            at a bar until 2:00,

859
00:36:38,374 --> 00:36:40,641
             and she went to bed
             at 9:00 pm.        

860
00:36:40,709 --> 00:36:43,410

            No way!

Let's do it.                    

1071
00:45:01,612 --> 00:45:03,278
                 So, how are you
                 feeling about  

1072
00:45:03,347 --> 00:45:05,447
     the whole, like, Cara thing
     and everything?            

1073
00:45:05,516 --> 00:45:07,249
        This situation,         

1074
00:45:07,318 --> 00:45:09,985
like, the fact that             
she came into this              

1075
00:45:10,054 --> 00:45:12,221
     on Juliette's weekend,     

1076
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:13,255
           and it...            

1077
00:45:13,324 --> 00:45:14,890
        it a little bit         
       worries me, like,        

1078
00:45:14,959 --> 00:45:16,558
    what her intentions are.    
             Well, now it's like

1079
00:45:16,627 --> 00:45:19,395
    she has to understand, like,
    if you're coming here,      

1080
00:45:19,463 --> 00:45:22,898
        like, I can't be, like, 
        BFFs with you and, like,

1081
00:45:22,967 --> 00:45:24,300
              of course I can   
              be nice and stuff,

1082
00:45:24,368 --> 00:45:26,201
             but, like, I'm here
             for Juliette.      

1083
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:28,938
           And, like-- so she   
           is my first priority.

1084
00:45:29,006 --> 00:45:31,840
When we were having dinner,     
like, on the rooftop,           

1085
00:45:31,909 --> 00:45:33,209
Juliette was, like,             
literally, like,                

1086
00:45:33,277 --> 00:45:35,744
        letting Cara see        
       all her emotions,        

1087
00:45:35,813 --> 00:45:36,812
and then Cara was just          
sitting there                   

1088
00:45:36,881 --> 00:45:38,047
so calm and relaxed...          
                           Yeah.

1089
00:45:38,115 --> 00:45:39,114
...and, like, smiling,          
and I was like,                 

1090
00:45:39,183 --> 00:45:41,650
"Oh, that must                  
kill Juliette."                 

1091
00:45:41,719 --> 00:45:42,885
Like, that sucks.               

1092
00:45:42,954 --> 00:45:45,020
It seemed like Cara             
was almost                      

1093
00:45:45,089 --> 00:45:47,022
too vindictive and,             
like, patronizing,              
and I hope I'm wrong.           

1094
00:45:47,091 --> 00:45:49,325
                 My hope is that
                 she really does
                 like Garrett,  

1095
00:45:49,393 --> 00:45:52,661
               and that's, like,
               why she's here.  
I would hope so.                

1096
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:55,197
            So, how are things? 
            You glad Ben's here?

1097
00:45:55,266 --> 00:45:56,365
I'm really glad.                

1098
00:45:57,869 --> 00:46:00,803
I'm still going to...           

1099
00:46:00,872 --> 00:46:03,339
figure out                      
where we really are.            

1100
00:46:03,408 --> 00:46:05,908
                           Yeah.
And, in this group,             
it's a little more intense.     

1101
00:46:05,977 --> 00:46:06,976
It's like, "What are            
you guys doing?                 

1102
00:46:07,044 --> 00:46:08,277

What's happening?"              

1104
00:46:09,714 --> 00:46:11,113
            Do you feel, like,  
            pressured, you mean,

1105

              you wanna give it

1109

to that level.
