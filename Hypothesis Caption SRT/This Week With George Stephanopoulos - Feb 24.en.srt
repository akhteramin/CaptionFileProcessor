      throughout the day.

00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:59,896
  WELCOME TO FOWLER, INDIANA.   

711
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:03,567
      ONE OF THE WINDIEST       
      PLACES IN AMERICA.        

712
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:06,069
       AND HOME TO THREE        
       BP WIND FARMS.           

713
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:10,440
   IN THE OFF-CHANCE THE WIND   
   EVER STOPS BLOWING HERE...   

714
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,376
THE LIGHTS CAN KEEP ON SHINING. 

715
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:14,244
   THANKS TO OUR NATURAL GAS.

       RENEWABLE ENERGY.

 IT'S ALWAYS READY WHEN NEEDED. 

718
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:20,751
           OR... NOT.           

719
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:23,920
   AT BP, WE SEE                
   POSSIBILITIES EVERYWHERE.    

720
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:26,089

       KEEP ADVANCING.          

721
00:20:35,533 --> 00:20:37,768
  For the 250K service members  

722
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:40,270
 who transition out of the U.S. 
     military every year...     

723
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:42,439
  ...one of the toughest parts  
    is the search for a job     

724
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:43,907
      that takes advantage      
         of the skills          

725
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:45,809
  you've gained while serving.  

726
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:48,712
  You can now search with the   
   phrase 'jobs for veterans'   

727
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:49,946
     directly on Google...      

728
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:53,684
...and then enter your Military 
   Occupational Specialty Code. 

729
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:56,753
   Google brings together job   
  openings from across the web  

730
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:59,923
   that match the skills you    
 gained in your military role.  

731
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,191
      Just click to apply       

732
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:04,227
    and use your experience     
     to guide your future.      

733
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,312
 No matter how much you clean,  

734
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:24,648
  does your house still smell   
  stuffy?                       

735
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:26,183
  That's because your home is   
  filled                        

736
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:28,085
  with soft surfaces that trap  
  odors                         

737
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,120
 and release them back into the 
 room.                          

738
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:32,756
     So, try Febreze Fabric     
     Refresher.                 

739
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,891
 Febreze finds odors trapped in 
 fabrics                        

740
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:36,993
   and cleans them away as it   
   dries.                       

741
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:39,496
Use Febreze every time you tidy 
up                              

742
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:42,165
   to keep your whole house     
   smelling fresh air clean.    

743
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:44,534
Fabric Refresher even works for 
clothes you want                

744
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:46,103
      to wear another day.      

745
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,472
Make Febreze part of your clean 
routine                         

746
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:49,840
   for whole home freshness.    

747
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:55,045
<i>This is Charlie not coughing</i>    
<i>because he took Delsym 12-hour.</i> 

748
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,214
  <i> And this is Charlie still not</i>
  <i> coughing</i>                     

749
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:00,617
<i>while trying his hardest not to</i> 
<i>wake Zeus.</i>                      

750
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:01,952
        <i> Delsym 12-hour.</i>        

751
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:05,188
            <i> Nothing lasts</i>      
            <i> longer for powerful</i>
            <i> cough relief.</i>      

752
00:22:10,411 --> 00:22:11,511
     They're our parents...     

753
00:22:11,547 --> 00:22:13,580
    neighbors... loved ones.    

754
00:22:13,615 --> 00:22:16,583
   Living with diseases like    
       cancer, epilepsy,        

755
00:22:16,618 --> 00:22:19,252
    mental health conditions    
            and HIV.            

756
00:22:19,288 --> 00:22:20,887
   Maybe you're one of them.    

757
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:23,590
But new Medicare rules could    
deny access to the latest,      

758
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:25,559
most effective therapies...     

759
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:28,628
      therapies that keep       
         them healthy.          

760
00:22:28,664 --> 00:22:31,298
Are Medicare cuts that save less
than one percent                

761
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:34,467
worth the risk to millions of   
patients?                       

762
00:22:34,503 --> 00:22:35,969
    President Trump promised    

763
00:22:36,004 --> 00:22:37,671
     to protect Medicare...     

764
00:22:37,706 --> 00:22:39,940
 We need him to keep his word.

WHAT HE WAS TRYING TO DO IS     

771
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:05,382
WHAT HE WAS TRYING TO DO IS     
TERRIBLE AND HE WAS CAUGHT.
