64

   right down the street here.  

65
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:13,084
     It was about 10 blocks     
   from here, McCartey School.  

66
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:14,886
    And then I remember years   
       ago when I used --       

67
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:17,722
 used to come home from school. 

68

        on a wood stove.        

69
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,663

      got from school, uh,      

70
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,998

71

 when I lived on Jourdan Avenue,

 in the street, Jourdan Avenue,

74
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:36,374
     The street was so bad,     
      the holes were so big     

75
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:39,444
     they used to get stuff     
   from the cotton bale and --  

76
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:42,080
   and and fill the street up   
 with nothin' but tin and iron. 

77
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:44,716
     That -- that's the way     
       Jourdan Avenue was.      

78
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,551
      And I used to sell it     
      to -- sell the scrap.     

79

      or 25 cents livin'...     

80
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,058

      things that he'd see.     

84
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,067
   And sometimes he'd sell 'em  
       to the junkman who,      

85
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,368

86
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:06,304
        would become part       
of the song "The Junker's Blues"

89

108
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:55,620

109

110

 on the piano on pieces of tape.

111
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:02,894
   And it was a beat-up piano.

130
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:45,503
     Fats started listening     
       more to jukeboxes.       

131
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:48,573
  That's basically the way that 
blacks heard music in those days

132
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:51,443
    because not a lot of 'em    
       had record players.      

133
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:55,313

played black music at that time.

  Fats' primary love for music  

136
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,457
    was in the boogie-woogie    
         piano players.         

137
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,328
      He always listened to     
         Meade Lux Lewis        

138
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:13,598

    the great piano players.    

139
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:17,268
   His cousins had a, uh, bar.  

140
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:19,337
    And he actually not only    
      had a jukebox there,      

141
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:21,139
 he also had a sounding machine,

142
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,842
     which was I guess kind     
   of a luxury in those days.

     I think it was a video     
      called Low Down Dog.      

145
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:31,116

175
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:37,108
    was Amos Milburn, who was   
  a great boogie-woogie player. 

176

577

580
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:26,181
   -COLEMAN: "Blueberry Hill"   
       was a pop standard       

581
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,884
    that had originally been    
        recorded in 1940        

582
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:32,521
          by Gene Autry         
   for a singin' cowboy movie.  

583
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,990
But the most significant version
            for Fats            

584
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:40,796
was the Louis Armstrong version.

585
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:43,499
    It was a phenomenal time    
            for him.            

586
00:31:43,567 --> 00:31:46,969
  The unfortunate thing is that 
  Lew Chudd of Imperial Records 

587
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:52,307
 actually tried too hard to sell
Fats Domino to a white audience.

588
00:31:52,376 --> 00:31:56,111
   He thought that if you made  
       it sound more pop,       

589
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,714
    it would sell more white.   

590
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:01,650
 But he kind of missed the point
         of Fats Domino.        

591
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:04,620
 And so he was having him record
      all these standards.      

592
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:06,555
    Some worked, some didn't.   

593
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:08,791
   As "Blueberry Hill" proved,  

594
00:32:08,859 --> 00:32:10,793
         when Fats redid        
           a standard,          

595
00:32:10,861 --> 00:32:12,761
    he changed it all around    
          so the people         

596
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,864
   that knew the old standard,  
   they barely recognized it.

00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,581
And then he had us as many times
       that we wanted to.

       Here is Fats Domino      
    singing "Blueberry Hill."

        behind a curtain.       

749
00:40:41,571 --> 00:40:44,806
  And he put Fats just playing  
      the piano by himself,     

750
00:40:44,874 --> 00:40:46,908
 which was a very strange thing 
            for Fats.           

751
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:50,445
   And then even stranger was   
 at the very end of the show -- 

752
00:40:50,513 --> 00:40:54,515
   of the song, I should say,   
         Fats stood up.         

753
00:40:54,584 --> 00:40:56,317
 It was kind of like Ed Sullivan

754
00:40:56,386 --> 00:40:58,686
      wanted people to see      
   how chubby he was so that,

 There was no other bigger star

     to get to Fats Domino.

        I'm not kiddin'.

        and picked me up,

          I'm helpless,         
     and put me on the bus.

   That was my life out there.

   A lot of times we was doin'  
       them one nighters,       

800

       on from the bottom       
        to the top floor.       

804
00:43:21,698 --> 00:43:24,498
      -NARRATOR: With Fats'     
      enormous popularity,      

805
00:43:24,567 --> 00:43:27,468
  promoters had little trouble  
      filling concert halls     

806
00:43:27,537 --> 00:43:30,137
   and ballrooms to capacity.   

807

      White and black fans      
   clamored to see Fats live,

00:43:34,344 --> 00:43:38,546
            sometimes           
     with explosive results.

811
00:43:42,785 --> 00:43:45,720
     He had four major riots    
          at his shows,         

812
00:43:45,788 --> 00:43:47,288
  partly because of integration 

813
00:43:47,357 --> 00:43:51,692
   but also the fact that they  
   had alcohol at these shows.  

814
00:43:51,761 --> 00:43:56,030
   So they were mixing alcohol  
          plus dancing          

815
00:43:56,099 --> 00:43:58,633
     plus the races together    
       for the first time       

816
00:43:58,701 --> 00:44:00,234
    in a lot of these places.   

817
00:44:00,303 --> 00:44:01,936
       And it was leading       
       to a little fights       

818
00:44:02,005 --> 00:44:04,071
       which soon bloomed       
        into huge fights.       

819
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:06,274
   And they called the police.  

820
00:44:06,342 --> 00:44:07,908
    -HARDESTY: We got caught    
          in two riots.         

821
00:44:07,977 --> 00:44:11,379
        And it wasn't --        
    it wasn't a racial thing.   

822
00:44:11,447 --> 00:44:13,414
       There was a fight.       

823
00:44:13,483 --> 00:44:15,549
  And with -- within the fight, 

824
00:44:15,618 --> 00:44:19,587
   the police decided to throw  
      tear gas in the hall.     

825
00:44:19,656 --> 00:44:21,856
      And everybody panic.      

826
00:44:21,924 --> 00:44:23,691
       Well, it turned out      
        not to be a riot,       

827
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,326
        but people tryin'       
          to escape --          

828
00:44:25,395 --> 00:44:28,663
     tryin' to get away from    
          the tear gas.         

829
00:44:28,731 --> 00:44:30,398
 When they started broadcastin' 
        that there was --       

830
00:44:30,466 --> 00:44:33,801
  where Fats Domino was playin' 
   and there was a race riot,   

831
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:36,303
      that was a $1 million     
      exposure right there.     

832
00:44:36,372 --> 00:44:38,539
All the news media picked it up.

833
00:44:38,608 --> 00:44:40,474
     So that was publicity.     

834
00:44:40,543 --> 00:44:43,177
          But there...          
   It wasn't a real race riot.

   under an awful heavy attack  

837
00:44:46,783 --> 00:44:48,416
   from all over the country.   
       There's been riots.      

838
00:44:48,484 --> 00:44:50,551
        It's been banned        
in certain parts of this country

839
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:51,652
           and abroad.          

840
00:44:51,721 --> 00:44:53,387
You know of any reason for that?

841
00:44:53,456 --> 00:44:55,189
    -Well, as far as I know,    

842

    music make people happy.    
    I know it make me happy.

        it was the music?

 the country's most popular one,

852
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:17,378
        was mired in the

853

   -DOMINO: Sometimes we used   
  to go up 100 mile out the way 

855
00:45:24,387 --> 00:45:26,454
    to get a place to sleep.    

856
00:45:26,522 --> 00:45:30,558
   -It was tough. We stayed in  
   little, small-like hotels.   

857

  We didn't have the privilege  
   and the -- the restaurants.

   I started drivin' the bus.   

859
00:45:39,335 --> 00:45:41,235
         And I would go

00:45:43,773 --> 00:45:46,841
 along to push things, you know?

862
00:45:46,909 --> 00:45:49,009
       And when the hotels      
  first integrated, that was -- 

863
00:45:49,078 --> 00:45:50,578
  I was the first ones in them. 

864
00:45:50,646 --> 00:45:54,248
  -Well, I think there is, uh,  
  no doubt about the fact that, 

865
00:45:54,317 --> 00:45:58,752
          uh, the Negro         
   is more determined now than  

866
00:45:58,821 --> 00:46:00,254
     ever before to be free.    

867
00:46:00,323 --> 00:46:04,158
      I think that there is     
          a discontent          

868
00:46:04,227 --> 00:46:07,761
     in the Negro community,    
a frustration and an impatience,

869
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:10,731
  if we can use that word, uh,  

870
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,500
  that we haven't seen before.  

871

     for the last few days,

          uh, speaking.         

873
00:46:17,273 --> 00:46:20,074
        And I don't think       
       I've ever seen, uh,      

874
00:46:20,142 --> 00:46:22,209
      the Negro population      
          of our nation         

875
00:46:22,278 --> 00:46:26,480
more aroused and more determined

876
00:46:26,549 --> 00:46:29,583
          as I've seen          
   on these particular trips.

 Martin Luther King got killed, 

878
00:46:31,787 --> 00:46:34,555
   Fats was in that same hotel  
       2 weeks before then      

879
00:46:34,624 --> 00:46:37,825
       playin' for the --       
   the garbage workers there.   

880
00:46:37,894 --> 00:46:40,694
        He'd bring the --       
  the workers together when --  

881
00:46:40,763 --> 00:46:43,364
       whenever he'd play,      
        white and black.        

882
00:46:43,432 --> 00:46:45,733
 It's somethin' about his person

883

         that draw a lot

        once it accepted,

  and once the -- the audience, 
           the people           

886
00:46:56,045 --> 00:46:57,578
   started wantin' this music,  

887
00:46:57,647 --> 00:46:59,446
        there was nothin'       
     that the radio stations    

888
00:46:59,515 --> 00:47:01,615
 or television can do about it. 

889

      this historic moment

       in American history

  were kind of coming together.

      credit rock 'n' roll

    with integrating America.
