      with Neulasta Onpro?      

932
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:41,758
  Strong chemo can put you at   
   risk of serious infection.   

933
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:44,544
    In a key study Neulasta     
 reduced the risk of infection  

934
00:37:44,563 --> 00:37:46,846
        from 17% to 1%,         

935
00:37:46,881 --> 00:37:48,682

   Neulasta Onpro is designed   
      to deliver Neulasta

00:37:51,052 --> 00:37:52,218
      the day after chemo       

938
00:37:52,237 --> 00:37:54,321
  and is used by most patients  
             today.             

939
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:55,939
    Neulasta is for certain     
        cancer patients         

940
00:37:55,991 --> 00:37:57,941
 receiving strong chemotherapy. 

941
00:37:57,993 --> 00:37:59,826
 Do not take Neulasta if you're 
         allergic to it         

942
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:01,661
   or Neupogen (filgrastim).    

943
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:03,863
    An incomplete dose could    
    increase infection risk.

     serious lung problems,     

946
00:38:07,336 --> 00:38:08,535
      allergic reactions,       

947
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:11,338
 kidney injuries and capillary  
  leak syndrome have occurred.  

948
00:38:11,373 --> 00:38:13,573
  Report abdominal or shoulder  
  tip pain, trouble breathing   

949
00:38:13,592 --> 00:38:15,875

    your doctor right away.

    In patients with sickle     
        cell disorders,         

951
00:38:17,713 --> 00:38:19,879
serious, sometimes fatal crises 
           can occur.           

952
00:38:19,914 --> 00:38:22,515
  The most common side effect   
    is bone and muscle ache.    

953
00:38:22,551 --> 00:38:24,017
    If you'd rather be home,    

954
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:26,686
     ask your doctor about      
        Neulasta Onpro.
