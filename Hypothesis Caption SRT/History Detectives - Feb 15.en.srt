468
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:20,550
AND HE HAD THIS WITH HIM.       

469
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,586
ONE OF HIS EMPLOYEES,           
A LAKOTA MAN,                   

470
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:24,821
HAD PUT IT IN HOCK              
AND SAID HE COULD HAVE IT       

471
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,923
IF HE WENT DOWN                 
AND TOOK IT OUT OF PAWN.        

472
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:29,626
SO HE BROUGHT IT DOWN           
TO MY NEWSPAPER.                

473
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:32,996

   ABOUT CRAZY HORSE?           

477

COULDN'T HIT HIM.               

480
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:53,483
ONE OF THE REASONS              
HE'S SO ADMIRED AND LOVED       

481
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:57,120
BY THE LAKOTA PEOPLE TODAY      
IS HE WOULD NEVER SIGN A TREATY.

OR ANY OF HIS PEOPLE,           

483

        COMPLEX ISSUES          

801
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:53,221
    ABOUT CULTURAL HERITAGE     
       AND WHO OWNS IT.         

802
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:56,758
   TODAY, LITERALLY MILLIONS    
 OF AMERICAN INDIAN ARTIFACTS   

803
00:34:56,827 --> 00:35:00,696
ARE HOUSED IN NON-NATIVE MUSEUMS
   AND PRIVATE COLLECTIONS.     

804
00:35:00,764 --> 00:35:04,499
  MANY OF THESE OBJECTS, LIKE   
 TOOLS, WEAPONS, AND CLOTHES,   

805
00:35:04,568 --> 00:35:07,336
     WERE ACQUIRED THROUGH      
    PERFECTLY LEGAL MEANS.      

806
00:35:07,404 --> 00:35:11,206
 OTHERS, HOWEVER, WERE BOUGHT   
    FOR PENNIES OR STOLEN.      

807
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,575
    THE U.S. GOVERNMENT SAW     
   NOTHING WRONG WITH THIS,     

808
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:16,111
  SINCE ITS OFFICIAL POSITION   
         ON THE TRIBES          

809
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:19,681
 WAS TO TRY TO ASSIMILATE THEM  
     INTO THE MAINSTREAM.       

810
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,751
      BUT NATIVE PEOPLES        
      ARE STILL WITH US,        

811
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:26,388
AND SOME HAVE BEGUN TO ASK FOR  
       -- EVEN DEMAND --        

812
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,957

        ARTIFACTS BACK.         

813
00:35:29,026 --> 00:35:32,360
SO IN 1990, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT 
        SIGNED INTO LAW         

814
00:35:32,429 --> 00:35:34,930
      THE NATIVE AMERICAN       
       GRAVE PROTECTION

00:35:34,998 --> 00:35:38,133
     AND REPATRIATION ACT,      
          OR NAGPRA.            

816
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:41,269
        NAGPRA REQUIRES         
FEDERALLY FUNDED ORGANIZATIONS  

817
00:35:41,338 --> 00:35:45,307
TO RETURN SKELETONS AND OBJECTS 
     OF CULTURAL PATRIMONY      

818
00:35:45,375 --> 00:35:46,942
   TO TRIBAL REPRESENTATIVES    

819
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:49,144
        IF THEY FOLLOW          
    THE CORRECT PROCEDURES.     

820
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:52,647
    NAGPRA ONLY APPLIES TO      
FEDERALLY FUNDED ORGANIZATIONS. 

821
00:35:52,716 --> 00:35:55,183
      PRIVATE COLLECTIONS       
       OR MUSEUMS ABROAD        

822
00:35:55,252 --> 00:35:57,619
       DON'T FALL UNDER         
       ITS JURISDICTION.        

823
00:35:57,688 --> 00:36:00,789
   DESPITE THESE CHALLENGES,    
  BOTH THE TRIBES AND MUSEUMS   

824
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:03,725

1218
00:53:23,198 --> 00:53:25,665
   IT WAS A REAL HOLOCAUST.     

1219
00:53:25,734 --> 00:53:27,734
  SOME OF THE GUYS CAME BACK,   
 THEY WERE ALMOST HYSTERICAL.   

1220
00:53:27,803 --> 00:53:29,302
       THEY COULD HARDLY        
      CONTAIN THEMSELVES.       

1221
00:53:29,371 --> 00:53:32,038
  THOUGH THE LOSS IS TRAGIC,    
       THE WAR GOES ON.         

1222
00:53:32,107 --> 00:53:34,841
  THE NEXT DAY, THE MILITARY    
  SENDS ANOTHER BOMBER GROUP    

1223
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:37,477
        BACK TO KASSEL          
      TO FINISH THE JOB.        

1224
00:53:37,546 --> 00:53:40,914
      ALL OF THOSE PLANES       
       RETURNED SAFELY.
