 I don't know what's going on.  

925
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:01,291
I've done all sorts of research,

926
00:41:01,326 --> 00:41:02,692
     read earnings reports,     

927
00:41:02,727 --> 00:41:04,127
   looked at chart patterns.    

928
00:41:04,162 --> 00:41:06,162
     I've even built my own     
    historic trading model.     

929
00:41:06,198 --> 00:41:07,730
And you're still not sure if you
    want to make the trade?     

930
00:41:07,766 --> 00:41:08,698
