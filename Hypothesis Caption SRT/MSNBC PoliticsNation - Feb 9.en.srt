PEOPLE INCLUDING YOUR BASE.     
THAT'S THE QUESTION.            

238
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,912
THAT'S THE QUESTION.

TOTAL OPPOSITE.                 

240
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:36,114
TOTAL OPPOSITE.                 
I MEAN, THE PRESIDENT'S BEEN IN 

241
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:38,049
I MEAN, THE PRESIDENT'S BEEN IN 
OFFICE FOR TWO YEARS NOW.       

242
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:39,317
OFFICE FOR TWO YEARS NOW.       
AND I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY    

243
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:41,820
AND I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY    
THAT TRADE DEFICITS, FOR        

244
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:43,722
THAT TRADE DEFICITS, FOR        
EXAMPLE, HAVE BEEN AN EXTREME

PRESIDENT THAT HAS PUT AMERICA  
FIRST WHEN IT COMES TO

FIRST WHEN IT COMES TO          
RENEGOTIATING TRADE AGREEMENTS. 

249
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:57,035
RENEGOTIATING TRADE AGREEMENTS. 
WHAT WE DO SEE HAPPENING IS     

250
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,770
WHAT WE DO SEE HAPPENING IS     
RECORD NUMBER OF JOBS COMING    

251
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,272
RECORD NUMBER OF JOBS COMING    
BACK INTO THE UNITED STATES.

WE SEE UNEMPLOYMENT AS AN       

253
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:03,742
WE SEE UNEMPLOYMENT AS AN       
ALL-TIME LOW.                   

254
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:04,709
ALL-TIME LOW.                   
WE SEE AFRICAN-AMERICAN

00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,912
WE SEE AFRICAN-AMERICAN         
UNEMPLOYMENT HISTORICALLY AT    

256
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:09,648
UNEMPLOYMENT HISTORICALLY AT    
LOWER LEVELS BECAUSE HE IS

LOWER LEVELS BECAUSE HE IS      
EMPOWERING THE ECONOMY BY BY

EMPOWERING THE ECONOMY BY BY    
TAKING ON --

00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:16,154
TAKING ON --                    
>> UNEMPLOYMENT WAS GOING DOWN  

260
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:18,356
>> UNEMPLOYMENT WAS GOING DOWN  
BEFORE HE CAME IN AND IT JUST

00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:19,524
CONTINUED.                      
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE   

263
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:23,228
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE   
FACT THAT HE PROMISED HE WAS    

264
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:23,929
FACT THAT HE PROMISED HE WAS    
GOING TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE

THE DEFICIT, DAVID, IS HIGHER   
THAN IT HAS BEEN, AND HE IS THE

00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:42,714
BUSINESSMAN.                    
HE SAID HE WOULD SOLVE THIS     

277
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:43,615
HE SAID HE WOULD SOLVE THIS     
PROBLEM OF THE DEFICIT.         

278
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:44,516
PROBLEM OF THE DEFICIT.         
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A          

279
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:46,017
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A          
BALLOONING DEFICIT WE'LL HAVE TO

280
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,320
BALLOONING DEFICIT WE'LL HAVE TO
PAY FOR, WE'RE GOING TO PAY THE

PAY FOR, WE'RE GOING TO PAY THE 
PRICE AT SOME POINT.            

282
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,389
PRICE AT SOME POINT.            
AND IT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF     

283
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:52,190
AND IT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF     
DONALD TRUMP BETRAYING          

284

WHAT I THINK.                   
WE HAVE NOT HAD THIS DISCUSSION 

304
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:32,497
WE HAVE NOT HAD THIS DISCUSSION 
AT THE CAMPAIGN.                

305
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:34,532
AT THE CAMPAIGN.                
THAT IS A WHITE HOUSE QUESTION. 

306
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:35,934
THAT IS A WHITE HOUSE QUESTION. 
BUT I WILL ALSO SAY THANK YOU

BUT I WILL ALSO SAY THANK YOU   
AND I'M VERY GLAD THAT DEMOCRATS

BUT WITH REGARDS TO NORTH KOREA,

311
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:45,076
BUT WITH REGARDS TO NORTH KOREA,
IT'S VERY TELLING THAT PRESIDENT

312
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:46,244
IT'S VERY TELLING THAT PRESIDENT
TRUMP DURING THE CAMPAIGN       

313
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:48,647
TRUMP DURING THE CAMPAIGN       
PROMISED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE    

314
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:50,982
PROMISED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE    
THAT HE WOULD DO WHATEVER IT

THAT HE WOULD DO WHATEVER IT    
TOOK TO TRY AND RESOLVE THESE

MAJOR ISSUES AROUND THE WORLD,  
NORTH KOREA BEING ONE OF THEM.  

318
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:57,188
NORTH KOREA BEING ONE OF THEM.  
OF COURSE WE EXPECT NORTH KOREA 

319
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,490
OF COURSE WE EXPECT NORTH KOREA 
TO GIVE THEIR OWN VERSION OF

00:10:58,492 --> 00:10:58,857
TO GIVE THEIR OWN VERSION OF

I DON'T THINK ANYONE IS         

322
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:01,660
I DON'T THINK ANYONE IS         
SURPRISED THAT THEY HAVE THEIR  

323
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:03,662
SURPRISED THAT THEY HAVE THEIR  
OWN PROPAGANDA THAT THEY PUSH   

324
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:04,029
OWN PROPAGANDA THAT THEY PUSH   
OUT.

00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:07,265
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, MANY      
AMERICANS ARE ACTUALLY PLEASED

THROWING INSULTS OUT THERE      

602
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:41,792
THROWING INSULTS OUT THERE

00:23:17,964 --> 00:23:20,297
JUST WHAT THIS PRESIDENT DOES,  
WHICH IS JUST FOCUS ON 37% THAT

BECAUSE, AS YOU KNOW, THIS IS A 

690

IN ORDER TO DO THAT, WE HAVE TO 

697

IN ORDER TO DO THAT, WE HAVE TO 
PAY AS MUCH ATTENTION NOT ONLY

PAY AS MUCH ATTENTION NOT ONLY  
TO THE END RESULT, BUT ALSO TO
