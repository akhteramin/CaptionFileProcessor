    When my grandmother died,   

126
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:23,641
         I still stayed         
       in the little house      

127
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:27,245
    that my grandmother and I   
  had lived in before she died. 

128
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:30,048
        I felt deserted.        

129
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:33,685
         Nobody but me.         

130
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,320
         And I remember         

131
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:38,122
  she owed something like $35,  
        $40 or something,       

132
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:39,958
 but we didn't make much money. 

133
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,893
 I was making $15 a month, so...

134
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,262
           But I paid           
     my grandmother's bill.     

135
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:46,564
      I paid it off myself.     

136
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:47,765
      After my daddy got me     

137
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:52,937
         and brought me         
   to Lexington, Mississippi,   

138
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:55,073
       and I started going      
        to school there,        

139
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,709
 which was the first big school 
        I'd ever gone to.       

140
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,978
  He had three girls and a boy, 

141
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:03,615
    and those was my sisters    
          and brother.          

142
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:06,184
     My daddy never told me     
          he loved me.          

143
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:07,519
           Never did.           

144
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:10,889
But anytime he was very pleased,
       I had that feeling.      

145
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:13,892
       He called me "Jack"      
   out of the clear blue sky.   

146
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,660
    "Jack, what do you think    
          about this?"          

147
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:17,295
      Or "What do you think     
          about that?"          

148
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:19,497
      And I'd feel so good      
      till I'd almost cry,      

149
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:21,099

163
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:03,541
   of really experiencing what  
  segregation was really like.  

164
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,944
     A mob had killed a boy.    
        They'd hung him.        

165

 I've never forgotten, I guess, 

170
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:24,829
   It's something like seeing   
    people killed in the war.

      You don't forget it.      

172
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,468
MATTHEWS: You were just a thing,
       not a human being,       

173
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:31,669
       just a work thing.       

174
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:32,904
       They had a slogan,

00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:35,807
         "If a mule die,

178
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,380
    MATTHEWS: And that meant    
        you were nobody.        

179
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:44,615
 You just about equal to a mule.

180
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:49,187
     It was badder than bad.

     and hatred and denial.

      that all of us faced.     

186
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:03,634
   There was racism, bigotry,

        back and I said,

496
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:56,799

     that she would say no,     

497
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:58,401
    and he didn't want that.    

498
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:01,671
 So he said, "We'll just have to
     wait until you get 18."    

499
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:05,975

00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:09,312

  Actually, I was 18 in March,  

502
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,785

   getting married until June

642

          at the time.

    I was living with my mom.   

644
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:55,684
   And when I saw B.B. receive  
     that kind of adulation,    

645
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:59,355
       that kind of honor,      

646
00:30:59,423 --> 00:31:01,824
 I said, "This is what I want."

   Nat King Cole broke through

     and they accepted him,     

653
