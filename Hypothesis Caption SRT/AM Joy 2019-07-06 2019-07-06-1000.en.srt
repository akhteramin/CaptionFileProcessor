1428
00:59:54,258 --> 00:59:55,357

      with these stories,       
    can be transformational.    

1441
01:00:18,899 --> 01:00:21,817
     It's my own thing that     
        I can do for me.

01:09:44,881 --> 01:09:46,347
THERE HAS BEEN THIS IDEA EVEN   
AMONG AFRICAN-AMERICANS, IT'S   

1750
01:09:46,349 --> 01:09:49,217
AMONG AFRICAN-AMERICANS, IT'S

REALLY THE WAY YOU MAKE CHANGE  

2456
01:40:09,204 --> 01:40:11,137
REALLY THE WAY YOU MAKE CHANGE  
IS IN POLICY, NOT BY QUITTING,  

2457
01:40:11,139 --> 01:40:12,605
IS IN POLICY, NOT BY QUITTING,  
BECAUSE I KNOW HE'S NOT GOING TO

01:40:19,147 --> 01:40:21,547
INDEPENDENT AND THE LIKELIHOOD  
OF HIM GETTING RE-ELECTED IS    

2463
01:40:21,549 --> 01:40:23,149

>> I THINK THE FINGER POINTING, 
IT SHOULD GO TOWARDS HOLLYWOOD  

2900
01:56:14,768 --> 01:56:16,501
IT SHOULD GO TOWARDS HOLLYWOOD  
AND THE FACT THAT OVERTHE PAST,

HOLLYWOOD BEGINS TO EMBRACE AND 
OPEN DOORS AND ALLOW CREATIVES

OPEN DOORS AND ALLOW CREATIVES

01:56:54,375 --> 01:56:55,540
THIS IS ALL A BIGGER PICTURE.   
WE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THIS    

2926
01:56:55,542 --> 01:57:00,145
WE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THIS    
BECAUSE THERE IS A BIGGER       

2927
01:57:00,147 --> 01:57:01,346
BECAUSE THERE IS A BIGGER       
PICTURE.                        

2928
01:57:01,348 --> 01:57:02,047
PICTURE.                        
                                

2929
01:57:02,049 --> 01:57:03,382
                                
THANK YOU, GUYS.                

2930
01:57:03,384 --> 01:57:04,850
THANK YOU, GUYS.                
COMING UP, MORE AM JOY AFTER THE

2931
01:57:04,852 --> 01:57:05,083
COMING UP, MORE AM JOY AFTER THE
BREAK.                          

2932
01:57:05,151 --> 01:57:05,784
       UP, MORE AM JOY AFTER THE
BREAK.                          

2933
01:57:05,818 --> 01:57:06,651
      ave moderate to           
  severe rheumatoid arthritis,  

2934
01:57:09,823 --> 01:57:10,872
       month after month,       

2935
01:57:10,908 --> 01:57:13,992
    the clock is ticking on     
   irreversible joint damage.   

2936
01:57:14,044 --> 01:57:15,627
   Ongoing pain and stiffness   

2937
01:57:15,662 --> 01:57:17,662
  are signs of joint erosion.   

2938
01:57:17,715 --> 01:57:19,965
HUMIRA can help stop the clock. 

2939
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,083
    Prescribed for 15 years,    

2940
01:57:21,118 --> 01:57:23,969
  HUMIRA targets and blocks a   
     source of inflammation     

2941
01:57:24,004 --> 01:57:27,672
 that contributes to joint pain 
    and irreversible damage.    

2942
01:57:27,725 --> 01:57:30,258
     HUMIRA can lower your      
  ability to fight infections.  

2943
01:57:30,293 --> 01:57:32,144
     Serious and sometimes      
        fatal infections        

2944
01:57:32,179 --> 01:57:34,146
    including tuberculosis,     
          and cancers,          

2945
01:57:34,181 --> 01:57:35,931
      including lymphoma,       
         have happened;         

2946
01:57:35,966 --> 01:57:38,600
     as have blood, liver,      
  and nervous system problems,  

2947
01:57:38,635 --> 01:57:39,901
  serious allergic reactions,   

2948
01:57:39,937 --> 01:57:42,104
      and new or worsening      
         heart failure.         

2949
01:57:42,139 --> 01:57:43,772
      Tell your doctor if       
      you've been to areas      

2950
01:57:43,807 --> 01:57:45,690
where certain fungal infections 
          are common,           

2951
01:57:45,726 --> 01:57:46,825
     and if you've had TB,      

2952
01:57:46,860 --> 01:57:47,909
          hepatitis B,          

2953
01:57:47,945 --> 01:57:49,077
    are prone to infections,    

2954
01:57:49,113 --> 01:57:51,446
        or have flu-like        
       symptoms or sores.       

2955
01:57:51,481 --> 01:57:54,082
       Don't start HUMIRA       
   if you have an infection.    

2956
01:57:54,985 --> 01:57:56,118
      Help stop the clock       

2957
01:57:56,153 --> 01:57:59,004
    on further irreversible     
         joint damage.          

2958
01:57:59,039 --> 01:58:01,590
  Talk to your rheumatologist.  

2959
01:58:01,625 --> 01:58:03,091
     Right here. Right now.     

2960
01:58:03,127 --> 01:59:59,791
            HUMIRA.
