1
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:23,289
               .                

2
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:24,123
        I'm Craig Melvin.       

3
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:24,823
    And I'm Natalie Morales.    

4
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:27,827
    nd this is "Dateline."      

5
00:00:30,498 --> 00:00:32,031
R: I just                       
    dropped off the children    

6
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:33,966
        and he wouldn't         
      let me in the door.       

7
00:00:33,968 --> 00:00:35,401
     MAN: It was horrible.      

8
00:00:35,403 --> 00:00:37,470
  We're normal people, and the  
   person you're dealing with   

9
00:00:37,472 --> 00:00:40,706
        is a psychopath.        

10
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:43,275
   NATALIE MORALES: It's the    
story that haunted the country, 

11
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:45,444
   the case of Susan Powell.    

12
00:00:45,446 --> 00:00:48,014
       WOMAN: I was like,       
      this can't be real.       

13
00:00:48,016 --> 00:00:51,951
 And he professed to love them. 

14
00:00:51,953 --> 00:00:54,153
     NATALIE MORALES: Could     
    it have been prevented?     

15
00:00:54,155 --> 00:00:55,921
       SOCIAL WORKER: He        
      exploded the house.       

16
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:57,890
    As you listen to it now,    
    what does it do to you?     

17
00:00:57,892 --> 00:00:59,125
       It's excruciating.       

18
00:00:59,127 --> 00:01:01,227
      NATALIE MORALES: The      
     911 dispatcher shares      

19
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:03,696
   his story about that day.    

20
00:01:03,698 --> 00:01:08,467
     I wish I had recognized    
 the urgency of the situation.  

21
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:10,269
     NATALIE MORALES: Also,     
     the startling details      

22
00:01:10,271 --> 00:01:12,772
      of a plot unfolding.      

23
00:01:12,774 --> 00:01:14,273
 Nobody knew what was going on. 

24
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:16,876
      NATALIE MORALES: And      
     a father's unraveling.     

25
00:01:16,878 --> 00:01:20,479
        He just saw there       
        was no way out.         

26
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:23,049
   NATALIE MORALES: Intimate    
   emails from Susan herself.   

27
00:01:23,051 --> 00:01:27,954
   The young mother's private   
    fears in her own words.     

28
00:01:27,956 --> 00:01:31,290
     It's the genuine belief    
     of a good many people      

29
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:33,059
      that you killed her.      

30
00:01:33,061 --> 00:01:36,896
  NATALIE MORALES: Her husband  
speaks a final eerie interview. 

31
00:01:36,898 --> 00:01:39,332
         I love my sons         
      more than anything.       

32
00:01:39,334 --> 00:01:40,733
       I put them first.        

33
00:01:40,735 --> 00:01:42,435
     I put my family first.     

34
00:01:42,437 --> 00:01:44,270
         [theme music]          

35
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,347
       Hello, and welcome       
         to "Dateline."         

36
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:56,749
 The details are heartbreaking. 

37
00:01:56,751 --> 00:01:58,918
      The disappearance of      
      a young mom and what      

38
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,287
  befell her two little boys.   

39
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:03,189
      You'll hear from her      
      loved ones searching      

40
00:02:03,191 --> 00:02:05,158
    for answers and justice.    

41
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,294
     You'll also hear from      
   her husband, Josh Powell,    

42
00:02:08,296 --> 00:02:10,663
in his last in-depth interview. 

43
00:02:10,665 --> 00:02:13,499
      Words that are even       
       more haunting now.       

44
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:15,935
     Here is Keith Morrison     
    with "A Family's Story."    

45
00:02:18,673 --> 00:02:20,907
       KEITH MORRISON: It       
       is so sad to look        

46
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:24,878
  at them now, this apparently  
    perfectly normal family.    

47
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,280
      Just a young father       
     and his two young sons     

48
00:02:27,282 --> 00:02:30,016
       walking a postcard       
        shore, skipping         

49
00:02:30,018 --> 00:02:31,885
   rocks across the surface.    

50
00:02:31,887 --> 00:02:35,054
     But under the surface      
    of the man's own skin--     

51
00:02:35,056 --> 00:02:38,491
         Well, what was         
      beneath the surface?      

52
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:43,830
   How in the name of heaven    
     did this come to this?     

53
00:02:43,832 --> 00:02:45,298
    911 OPERATOR: Hi, ma'am.    

54
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,766
   Were you calling about the   
 fire on the 8200 block, ma'am? 

55
00:02:46,768 --> 00:02:48,068
      FEMALE CALLER: Yeah.      
     He exploded the house.     

56
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,202
       911 OPERATOR: OK.        

57
00:02:49,204 --> 00:02:50,503
         Do you know if         
     anyone's in the house?     

58
00:02:50,505 --> 00:02:51,538
      FEMALE CALLER: Yes.       

59
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,440
        There was a man         
       and two children.        

60
00:02:53,442 --> 00:02:55,442
       I just dropped off       
      the children and he       

61
00:02:55,444 --> 00:02:57,911
  wouldn't let me in the door.  

62
00:02:57,913 --> 00:02:59,579
     KEITH MORRISON: You'll     
  hear an exclusive interview   

63
00:02:59,581 --> 00:03:02,115
     with the man who took      
       that call and who        

64
00:03:02,117 --> 00:03:05,418
  has been criticized for not   
   getting help, immediately.   

65
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,921
     And you find yourself      
        vilified really.        

66
00:03:07,923 --> 00:03:08,788
      What was that like?       

67
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,290
        Well, it's awful.       

68
00:03:10,292 --> 00:03:12,993
     Part of the problem is     
     that, like most people     

69
00:03:12,995 --> 00:03:17,197
      I think, I was aware      
    of Josh Powell's story,     

70
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,634
     but I didn't associate     
    his name with the story.    

71
00:03:20,636 --> 00:03:23,003
KEITH MORRISON: We will retrace 
   Josh Powell's last steps.    

72
00:03:23,005 --> 00:03:25,905
        Mysterious trips        
       to a gas station.        

73
00:03:25,907 --> 00:03:27,674
     A storage locker where     
      the police said they      

74
00:03:27,676 --> 00:03:30,043
found a quilt with blood on it. 

75
00:03:30,045 --> 00:03:32,545
     And the bank were, in      
    the surveillance photo,     

76
00:03:32,547 --> 00:03:35,882
        he has the look         
       of a man unglued.        

77
00:03:35,884 --> 00:03:37,551
         And nobody knew        
       what was going on.       

78
00:03:37,553 --> 00:03:40,554
    He took more than three     
   or four substantial steps    

79
00:03:40,556 --> 00:03:42,188
  to get ready for his death.   

80
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,523
     KEITH MORRISON: We'll      
       hear investigators       

81
00:03:43,525 --> 00:03:46,326
try to fathom the unfathomable. 

82
00:03:46,328 --> 00:03:48,862
      What's the motive for     
     him killing his kids?      

83
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:53,233
    Is it that they started     
   knowing a little too much?   

84
00:03:53,235 --> 00:03:55,402
      KEITH MORRISON: And       
     in his last interview,     

85
00:03:55,404 --> 00:03:57,571
        we'll hear from         
      Josh Powell himself       

86
00:03:57,573 --> 00:03:59,739
     who offered, like the      
      negative of a film,       

87
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:02,442
a bizarre reversal of the truth.

88
00:04:02,444 --> 00:04:04,778
         I love my sons         
      more than anything.       

89
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,213
       I put them first.        

90
00:04:06,215 --> 00:04:08,148
     I put my family first.     

91
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,050
       KEITH MORRISON: On       
      February 5th, 2012,       

92
00:04:10,052 --> 00:04:12,018
     while the rest of the      
   country was settling down    

93
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:15,055
    to watch the Super Bowl,    
    Josh Powell was setting     

94
00:04:15,057 --> 00:04:17,891
 a trap for his own young sons. 

95
00:04:17,893 --> 00:04:20,894
   What happened in there was   
  really only the last chapter  

96
00:04:20,896 --> 00:04:24,731
      of a very long, sad       
   story of fathers and sons    

97
00:04:24,733 --> 00:04:27,434
    and husbands and wives,     
       sexual delusions,        

98
00:04:27,436 --> 00:04:32,272
 murder, suicide, and secrets.  

99
00:04:32,274 --> 00:04:36,109
Some of those secrets, no doubt,
  were burned up in the fire.   

100
00:04:36,111 --> 00:04:41,014
But some things we do know, and 
they go to the darkest recesses 

101
00:04:41,016 --> 00:04:43,150
      of the human heart.       

102
00:04:43,152 --> 00:04:45,752
   Our story begins years ago   
  when a cheerful young woman   

103
00:04:45,754 --> 00:04:49,289
 named Susan Cox fell for Josh. 

104
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:51,758
       Chuck and Judy Cox       
      are Susan's parents.      

105
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,627
   As they spoke to us, they    
   confessed they were still    

106
00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:56,263
    in a kind of shock after    
   the disaster that claimed    

107
00:04:56,265 --> 00:04:58,265
   their two young grandsons.   

108
00:04:58,267 --> 00:05:01,168
      And they recalled so      
   clearly their early fears    

109
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,136
  about their daughter's beau.  

110
00:05:03,138 --> 00:05:08,742
    I had a very bad feeling    
     every time I saw him.      

111
00:05:08,744 --> 00:05:12,846
   I even asked my daughter,    
  "Why are you marrying him?"   

112
00:05:12,848 --> 00:05:14,781
     KEITH MORRISON: Josh's     
    sister, Jennifer Graves,    

113
00:05:14,783 --> 00:05:18,619
    told us that as a child,    
    she was wary of him too.    

114
00:05:18,621 --> 00:05:21,121
    When Josh was a boy, he     
   was troubled in some ways,   

115
00:05:21,123 --> 00:05:22,155
           wasn't he?           

116
00:05:22,157 --> 00:05:24,124
  There were some issues, yeah. 

117
00:05:24,126 --> 00:05:25,792
    KEITH MORRISON: Jennifer    
   says much of the problems    

118
00:05:25,794 --> 00:05:28,161
        stemmed from her        
     father, Josh's father.     

119
00:05:28,163 --> 00:05:30,330
She is estranged from him today.

120
00:05:30,332 --> 00:05:33,500
   Their mother divorced him    
 years ago and in court papers  

121
00:05:33,502 --> 00:05:35,636
    alleged he was abusive.     

122
00:05:35,638 --> 00:05:39,573
       I was about 14 when      
    I woke up and realized,     

123
00:05:39,575 --> 00:05:41,642
       my dad is a wacko.       

124
00:05:41,644 --> 00:05:46,713
    He's just on a different    
trajectory, and not a good one. 

125
00:05:46,715 --> 00:05:49,750
     KEITH MORRISON: She is     
  talking about Steven Powell.  

126
00:05:49,752 --> 00:05:52,786
   You're going to learn much   
     more about him, later.     

127
00:05:52,788 --> 00:05:54,421
       What was it about        
      his trajectory that       

128
00:05:54,423 --> 00:05:55,756
 bothered you or disturbed you? 

129
00:05:55,758 --> 00:06:00,394
      He just had a really      
   negative outlook on life.    

130
00:06:00,396 --> 00:06:03,664
He was down on just everything. 

131
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:04,998
       KEITH MORRISON: An       
       outlook he seemed        

132
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,335
   to have passed on to Josh    
     which, paradoxically,      

133
00:06:08,337 --> 00:06:10,270
    seemed to attract Susan.    

134
00:06:10,272 --> 00:06:13,440
        I think she felt        
         sorry for him.         

135
00:06:13,442 --> 00:06:15,843
  He didn't have many friends.  

136
00:06:15,845 --> 00:06:20,714
      And I think she felt      
    she could make him happy    

137
00:06:20,716 --> 00:06:22,416
   and that he would change.    

138
00:06:22,418 --> 00:06:24,051
      KEITH MORRISON: They      
  married in the Mormon church  

139
00:06:24,053 --> 00:06:27,421
   and certainly looked happy   
     in those early photos.     

140
00:06:27,423 --> 00:06:29,256
         But later, the         
     couple moved to Utah.      

141
00:06:29,258 --> 00:06:32,726
   Moved in temporarily with    
 Jennifer and her husband Kirk. 

142
00:06:32,728 --> 00:06:35,229
 What was the relationship like 
then, as far as you could tell? 

143
00:06:35,231 --> 00:06:36,730
     It was a little rough.     

144
00:06:36,732 --> 00:06:40,667
    She would kind of order     
    him around a little bit     

145
00:06:40,669 --> 00:06:44,938
    and he wanted to control    
      her and not let her       

146
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,508
 go to some activities with me. 

147
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:50,477
  KEITH MORRISON: Josh worked,  
   sometimes, in real estate    

148
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,212
     and as a web designer.     

149
00:06:52,214 --> 00:06:54,515
   When Susan went into labor   
    with their first child,     

150
00:06:54,517 --> 00:06:57,451
  says Susan's parents, Josh,   
  working right there at home,  

151
00:06:57,453 --> 00:07:00,487
    said he was too busy to     
   drive her to the hospital.   

152
00:07:00,489 --> 00:07:01,722
           They did.            

153
00:07:01,724 --> 00:07:03,624
 And when he finally arrived--  

154
00:07:03,626 --> 00:07:06,293
   He sits in the back of the   
 room working on his computer.  

155
00:07:06,295 --> 00:07:07,161
      While she's in labor.     

156
00:07:07,163 --> 00:07:08,028
              Yeah.             

157
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,230
It was a really odd experience. 

158
00:07:10,232 --> 00:07:12,232
      KEITH MORRISON: They      
    named the baby Charlie.     

159
00:07:12,234 --> 00:07:14,735
Braden followed two years later.

160
00:07:14,737 --> 00:07:17,237
  But having kids only seemed   
    to increase the friction    

161
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:19,339
    between Susan and Josh.     

162
00:07:19,341 --> 00:07:21,475
      She would be wanting      
      to put them to bed.       

163
00:07:21,477 --> 00:07:24,011
    She would even go so far    
     as to get them in bed,     

164
00:07:24,013 --> 00:07:26,847
 and then he would get mad and  
  tell them to get out of bed   

165
00:07:26,849 --> 00:07:29,550
      and not do what mom       
        told them to do.        

166
00:07:29,552 --> 00:07:31,218
       Where did Josh get       
     these parenting ideas?     

167
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,487
      I'm sure from my dad.     

168
00:07:33,489 --> 00:07:36,190
    KEITH MORRISON: More and    
    more influence from dad,    

169
00:07:36,192 --> 00:07:37,524
         said Jennifer.         

170
00:07:37,526 --> 00:07:41,261
     Josh started talking on    
  the phone with my dad a lot.  

171
00:07:41,263 --> 00:07:45,999
    He would spend multiple     
  hours, multiple times a week  

172
00:07:46,001 --> 00:07:47,501
     on the phone with him.     

173
00:07:47,503 --> 00:07:53,807
  And Susan would complain to   
  me about how Josh would just  

174
00:07:53,809 --> 00:07:58,312
become unbearable to live with. 

175
00:07:58,314 --> 00:08:00,581
    It was really obvious to    
   her that my dad was trying   

176
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:03,917
 to drive a wedge between them. 

177
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,385
       KEITH MORRISON: It       
     seemed to be working.      

178
00:08:05,387 --> 00:08:06,887
        Jennifer shared         
       something with us        

179
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:08,589
       she has never made       
         public before.         

180
00:08:08,591 --> 00:08:10,524
 Excerpts of emails from Susan. 

181
00:08:10,526 --> 00:08:13,360
     Did they contain hints     
      of what was coming?       

182
00:08:13,362 --> 00:08:14,995
      In one of them, she       
     describes her attempts     

183
00:08:14,997 --> 00:08:17,631
 to rekindle romance with Josh. 

184
00:08:17,633 --> 00:08:19,800
        "I've tried the         
      dates thing with him      

185
00:08:19,802 --> 00:08:22,703
    and it goes to negative     
      or no conversation,       

186
00:08:22,705 --> 00:08:26,039
    or it's an obligation to    
  him that he seems to hate."   

187
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:30,444
    I think it's easy to say    
 that Josh learned from his dad 

188
00:08:30,446 --> 00:08:31,712
      how to treat women.       

189
00:08:31,714 --> 00:08:33,313
    KEITH MORRISON: And then    
     there's another email      

190
00:08:33,315 --> 00:08:35,716
    that suggests Susan was     
    actually afraid of him.     

191
00:08:35,718 --> 00:08:37,184
        "Every moment I         
       step back and take       

192
00:08:37,186 --> 00:08:38,485
stock of what I'm dealing with. 

193
00:08:38,487 --> 00:08:41,355
  It feels like a never-ending  
       cycle, but I'm too       

194
00:08:41,357 --> 00:08:43,190
  afraid of the consequences--  

195
00:08:43,192 --> 00:08:46,994
      losing my kids, him       
      kidnapping, divorce,      

196
00:08:46,996 --> 00:08:49,563
 or actions worse on his part." 

197
00:08:49,565 --> 00:08:56,437
        Why wouldn't he         
      just get a divorce?       

198
00:08:56,439 --> 00:08:59,173
   Because she had an income.   

199
00:08:59,175 --> 00:09:00,974
        She was the mom.        

200
00:09:00,976 --> 00:09:02,743
    There was a very strong     
     argument that the boys     

201
00:09:02,745 --> 00:09:04,445
   would have gone with her.    

202
00:09:04,447 --> 00:09:06,480
       SOCIAL WORKER: And       
        so they believe         

203
00:09:06,482 --> 00:09:11,085
       Josh found another       
    solution to his problem.    

204
00:09:11,087 --> 00:09:12,252
  NATALIE MORALES: Coming up.   

205
00:09:12,254 --> 00:09:17,524
     I sat on this feeling,     
       this gut-sinking,        

206
00:09:17,526 --> 00:09:23,130
    terrible feeling that he    
   has done something to her.   

207
00:09:23,132 --> 00:09:24,665
     NATALIE MORALES: When      
     "Dateline" continues.      

208
00:09:27,035 --> 00:09:30,204
      <i> Let's see, ALEVE is</i>      
     <i> proven better on pain</i>     

209
00:09:30,272 --> 00:09:32,005
  <i> than Tylenol Extra Strength.</i> 

210
00:09:32,074 --> 00:09:34,775
        <i> And last longer</i>        
       <i> with fewer pills.</i>       

211
00:09:34,844 --> 00:09:36,910
       So why am I still        
      thinking about this?      

212
00:09:36,979 --> 00:09:38,679
        I'll take Aleve.        

213
00:09:38,747 --> 00:09:40,848
           <i> ALEVE.</i>              
   <i> Proven better on pain.</i>      

214
00:10:12,747 --> 00:10:13,881

225
00:12:31,186 --> 00:12:33,987
    KEITH MORRISON: December    
 7th, 2009, gone gray and cold  

226
00:12:33,989 --> 00:12:35,088
       in Salt Lake City.       

227
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,323
           A Monday.            

228
00:12:36,325 --> 00:12:38,792
      Josh and Susan were       
     both expected at work.     

229
00:12:38,794 --> 00:12:40,527
       And neither one of       
       them had shown up,       

230
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:42,762
       and neither one of       
        them had called.        

231
00:12:42,764 --> 00:12:46,533
   And they were supposed to    
  have dropped off their kids.  

232
00:12:46,535 --> 00:12:48,668
  KEITH MORRISON: Dropped them  
   off at daycare, she means.   

233
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,704
  So the daycare center people  
     called their emergency     

234
00:12:50,706 --> 00:12:52,505
       contact, Jennifer.       

235
00:12:52,507 --> 00:12:54,608
        She went to Josh        
       and Susan's house.       

236
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,042
         It was empty.          

237
00:12:56,044 --> 00:12:58,812
       The feeling hit me       
   really strongly that Josh    

238
00:12:58,814 --> 00:13:00,447
   had done something to her.   

239
00:13:00,449 --> 00:13:02,082
        KEITH MORRISON:         
      Hindsight, perhaps?       

240
00:13:02,084 --> 00:13:05,585
 Or the insight of someone who  
 had grown up with Josh Powell. 

241
00:13:05,587 --> 00:13:07,754
     I said, "You know, hon,    
    don't worry about this.     

242
00:13:07,756 --> 00:13:09,823
     This is just a couple      
        and their kids.         

243
00:13:09,825 --> 00:13:10,590
          They're off.          

244
00:13:10,592 --> 00:13:12,225
        They're adults.         

245
00:13:12,227 --> 00:13:13,460
       They'll be fine."        

246
00:13:13,462 --> 00:13:14,794
     KEITH MORRISON: Then,      
      the late afternoon,       

247
00:13:14,796 --> 00:13:19,399
  Josh suddenly showed up with  
    the boys, without Susan.    

248
00:13:19,401 --> 00:13:21,301
       And I remember the       
  feeling I had at that time.   

249
00:13:21,303 --> 00:13:22,369
         Which was what?        

250
00:13:22,371 --> 00:13:24,971
         Which was, Josh        
      has done something.       

251
00:13:24,973 --> 00:13:27,273
  KEITH MORRISON: Josh told a   
  story no one could believe.   

252
00:13:27,275 --> 00:13:29,676
    That the previous night,    
       Sunday, he decided       

253
00:13:29,678 --> 00:13:31,144
   to take the boys camping.    

254
00:13:31,146 --> 00:13:32,679
 Left around midnight, he said. 

255
00:13:32,681 --> 00:13:33,613
         Blew off work.         

256
00:13:33,615 --> 00:13:35,615
    Drove almost 100 miles.     

257
00:13:35,617 --> 00:13:37,417
      Slept in the family       
      van in temperatures       

258
00:13:37,419 --> 00:13:39,018
      well below freezing.      

259
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:42,555
      Then drove back home      
      to find Susan, gone.      

260
00:13:42,557 --> 00:13:46,259
     He said he had no idea     
     what happened to her.      

261
00:13:46,261 --> 00:13:48,695
    When he came up with that   
   story about going camping,   

262
00:13:48,697 --> 00:13:50,029
          I was just--          

263
00:13:50,031 --> 00:13:51,464
              no.               

264
00:13:51,466 --> 00:13:54,734
  I got a really sick feeling   
   that no, this is not good.   

265
00:13:54,736 --> 00:13:59,138
 CROWD: (SINGING) Silent Night. 

266
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,240
        KEITH MORRISON:         
       And yet, they did        

267
00:14:00,242 --> 00:14:02,275
 what they felt they should do. 

268
00:14:02,277 --> 00:14:03,776
   They rallied around Josh.    

269
00:14:03,778 --> 00:14:05,845
        They pleaded for        
      Susan's safe return.      

270
00:14:05,847 --> 00:14:07,380
         We want to find        
        her, return her         

271
00:14:07,382 --> 00:14:09,415
  to her husband and children.  

272
00:14:09,417 --> 00:14:10,750
        KEITH MORRISON:         
     Within 10 days, police     

273
00:14:10,752 --> 00:14:12,385
        declared Josh a         
       person of interest       

274
00:14:12,387 --> 00:14:13,786
   in Susan's disappearance.    

275
00:14:13,788 --> 00:14:17,991
     He stopped talking to      
   police and then left town.   

276
00:14:17,993 --> 00:14:20,493
   Packed up his possessions    
     and his precious sons.     

277
00:14:20,495 --> 00:14:22,929
        Left Utah to go         
       live in Washington       

278
00:14:22,931 --> 00:14:25,098
    with his father, Steven.    

279
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,900
        When we spoke to        
      him in 2011, he told      

280
00:14:27,902 --> 00:14:30,069
  us he interrogated his son.   

281
00:14:30,071 --> 00:14:31,804
         Josh, you know,        
        the most abusive        

282
00:14:31,806 --> 00:14:38,077
   thing that a father could    
  ever do is murder his wife.   

283
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,412
  You know, things like that.   
         I wanted to--          

284
00:14:39,414 --> 00:14:41,080
    - You were testing him.     
      - I was testing him.      

285
00:14:41,082 --> 00:14:43,549
  I wanted to see his reaction  
     to this kind of stuff.     

286
00:14:43,551 --> 00:14:44,584
              And?              

287
00:14:44,586 --> 00:14:45,518
          It was good.          

288
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,086
I was totally satisfied with it.

289
00:14:47,088 --> 00:14:50,590
    I mean, to me, he passed    
      with flying colors.       

290
00:14:50,592 --> 00:14:52,492
       KEITH MORRISON: As       
      for Susan, he said,       

291
00:14:52,494 --> 00:14:55,328
   she had just run off with    
   another man, most likely.    

292
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:59,932
     Susan was veropen and      
  I would say very aggressive   

293
00:14:59,934 --> 00:15:03,135
 in male-female relationships.  

294
00:15:03,137 --> 00:15:05,571
   And she called the shots.    

295
00:15:05,573 --> 00:15:07,373
      KEITH MORRISON: How       
       did he know that?        

296
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,041
         Steven claimed         
      Susan had developed       

297
00:15:09,043 --> 00:15:13,112
 a long-standing crush on him.  

298
00:15:13,114 --> 00:15:15,514
        Susan would come        
        in to my office         

299
00:15:15,516 --> 00:15:18,718
   afteshe waxed her legs,      
    and she would sit there     

300
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,320
       and she would say,       
         "Feel my legs.         

301
00:15:21,322 --> 00:15:22,154
    They're pretty smooth."     

302
00:15:22,156 --> 00:15:23,322
     And so, yeah, I know.      

303
00:15:23,324 --> 00:15:25,224
           Josh wasn't          
     concerned about this?      

304
00:15:25,226 --> 00:15:26,959
       You know, I didn't       
     talk to Josh about it.     

305
00:15:26,961 --> 00:15:30,262
      I mean, you know, I       
    just enjoyed the moment.    

306
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:32,865
 KEITH MORRISON: Steven enjoyed 
quite a few moments with Susan, 

307
00:15:32,867 --> 00:15:33,933
            he said.            

308
00:15:33,935 --> 00:15:35,768
         Like when he'd         
       hand her the baby.       

309
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:39,772
     She'd come up and press    
   herself against my hands,    

310
00:15:39,774 --> 00:15:45,177
  and then I'd have to pull my  
   hands out from between her   

311
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:48,480
        and Braden, just        
      slip away, you know.      

312
00:15:48,482 --> 00:15:49,915
     That kind of a thing.      

313
00:15:49,917 --> 00:15:51,984
  KEITH MORRISON: He said his   
   only regret was not going    

314
00:15:51,986 --> 00:15:54,086
   a little further with her.   

315
00:15:54,088 --> 00:15:55,854
        I mean, it's not        
      like I didn't enjoy       

316
00:15:55,856 --> 00:15:57,656
  that kind of a little thing.  

317
00:15:57,658 --> 00:16:00,392
   KEITH MORRISON: It was so    
 easy for him to tell stories.  

318
00:16:00,394 --> 00:16:02,795
Susan could not defend herself. 

319
00:16:02,797 --> 00:16:04,863
         What he says is        
     not based on reality.      

320
00:16:04,865 --> 00:16:06,699
     KEITH MORRISON: Josh's     
    sister, Jennifer Graves,    

321
00:16:06,701 --> 00:16:08,167
   was a confidante of Susan.   

322
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:10,803
       And, of course, as       
       his daughter, she        

323
00:16:10,805 --> 00:16:13,205
 already knew all about Steven. 

324
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:16,008
       He might have felt       
     these things for her.      

325
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:18,877
       He might have been       
   sexually attracted to her.   

326
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:21,313
  But she did not reciprocate.  

327
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:23,048
   KEITH MORRISON: For a very   
   few uncomfortable months,    

328
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,783
        she said, early         
       in their marriage,       

329
00:16:24,785 --> 00:16:27,085
         Susan and Josh         
       lived with Steven.       

330
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:28,854
        They were set up        
      in the dining room,       

331
00:16:28,856 --> 00:16:32,758
       so they had put up       
    sheets for the privacy.     

332
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,027
       And she had caught       
     my dad spying on her.      

333
00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:37,229
         Did she say how        
       it made her feel?        

334
00:16:37,231 --> 00:16:40,832
       Oh, she definitely       
     was creeped out by it.     

335
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,734
       He definitely made       
       her uncomfortable.       

336
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:46,238
     There was one incident     
   where they were in a car.    

337
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,341
      He said, "Would you       
      be willing to share?      

338
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:51,977
Josh and I can just share you." 

339
00:16:51,979 --> 00:16:54,046
      KEITH MORRISON: And       
    now, Susan was missing.     

340
00:16:54,048 --> 00:16:56,281
        Josh was still a        
      person of interest.       

341
00:16:56,283 --> 00:16:58,884
Steven was telling lewd stories.

342
00:16:58,886 --> 00:17:01,119
       And these men had        
       Susan's children,        

343
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:02,988
    the Cox's grandchildren.    

344
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,991
    They were being raised by   
 the same person who had raised 

345
00:17:05,993 --> 00:17:10,128
     Josh, and my daughter      
       was just a hundred       

346
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:13,431
percent against them ever having
   anything to do with Steve.   

347
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:14,766
          And here they         
       were in his house.       

348
00:17:14,768 --> 00:17:16,101
          And here they         
       were in his house        

349
00:17:16,103 --> 00:17:19,471
    because Josh went there,    
  you know, brings them there.  

350
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:20,872
        KEITH MORRISON:         
       But Josh's actions       

351
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:22,574
      brought other people      
        to his father's         

352
00:17:22,576 --> 00:17:24,609
   house, namely the police.    

353
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:27,913
 In August, 2011, they arrived  
     with a search warrant.     

354
00:17:27,915 --> 00:17:30,348
    We've got probable cause    
     to believe that there      

355
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,417
       are some items of        
       evidentiary value        

356
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:34,319
inside the home of the Powells. 

357
00:17:34,321 --> 00:17:36,688
        KEITH MORRISON:         
       They found plenty.       

358
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,024
      Evidence that might       
        eventually help         

359
00:17:39,026 --> 00:17:43,862
    turn the mystery into an    
   incomprehensible tragedy.    

360
00:17:43,864 --> 00:17:47,098
      But back then, there      
    was no way to know that.    

361
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,701
   Even as we sat down for an   
   extraordinary conversation   

362
00:17:49,703 --> 00:17:54,105
  with the person of interest,  
     Josh Powell, himself,      

363
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:57,509
      no way to know then       
     that this conversation     

364
00:17:57,511 --> 00:17:59,777
     would be the last one.     

365
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:00,979
  NATALIE MORALES: Coming up.   

366
00:18:00,981 --> 00:18:02,547
       They're just trying      
      to rattle your cage.      

367
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:03,414
         It would seem.         

368
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,749
        Are you rattled?        

369
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:06,217
     I'm pretty pissed off.     

370
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:09,520
NATALIE MORALES: Josh Powell in 
his final television interview. 

371
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:12,490
      Were there hints of       
       what was to come?        

372
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:14,125
   When "Dateline" continues.   

373
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:21,944
       KEITH MORRISON: It       
       was August, 2011.        

374
00:21:21,946 --> 00:21:23,112
          Still warm.           

375
00:21:23,114 --> 00:21:24,881
         The night Josh         
       Powell came to see       

376
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:26,816
 us to break his long silence.  

377
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:28,251
      They know everything.     

378
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:30,686
KEITH MORRISON: An extraordinary
   conversation at the time,    

379
00:21:30,688 --> 00:21:33,256
   even more so in hindsight.   

380
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:34,924
        As we spoke, the        
     police were searching      

381
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:39,095
  for evidence at his father's  
 house in Puyallup, Washington. 

382
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:42,598
  Josh seemed quite confident   
  they wouldn't find anything.  

383
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,400
         Well, according        
        to my attorney,         

384
00:21:44,402 --> 00:21:48,170
       the less they have       
     on a person, the more      

385
00:21:48,172 --> 00:21:50,706
they basically harass a person. 

386
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:52,374
    So what you're suggesting   
      is that they're just      

387
00:21:52,376 --> 00:21:53,676
  trying to rattle your cage.   

388
00:21:53,678 --> 00:21:54,643
         It would seem.         

389
00:21:54,645 --> 00:21:55,945
        Are you rattled?        

390
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:57,546
     I'm pretty pissed off.     

391
00:21:57,548 --> 00:21:59,081
        KEITH MORRISON:         
      Josh claimed he knew      

392
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:02,518
 things about Susan's childhood 
 that her parents were hiding.  

393
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,722
 Susan's adult behavior, or at  
least Steven's lewd suggestions 

394
00:22:06,724 --> 00:22:09,091
        of her behavior,        
       claimed Josh, were       

395
00:22:09,093 --> 00:22:11,794
 the result of childhood abuse. 

396
00:22:11,796 --> 00:22:15,798
    An allegation the Coxes     
dismiss as patently ridiculous. 

397
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,967
        I've known about        
   things that she's told me    

398
00:22:18,969 --> 00:22:21,737
about while she was growing up. 

399
00:22:21,739 --> 00:22:23,205
          And you think         
       that's the reason        

400
00:22:23,207 --> 00:22:27,976
why, according to your father at
least, she would come onto him. 

401
00:22:27,978 --> 00:22:30,012
    I don't think people are    
   characterizing that right.   

402
00:22:32,683 --> 00:22:34,449
  She's a flirtatious person.   

403
00:22:34,451 --> 00:22:36,919
     I hate to tell you Josh    
   that others who have seen    

404
00:22:36,921 --> 00:22:41,323
    that interview with your    
   father have sort of gone,    

405
00:22:41,325 --> 00:22:44,826
      "Ew, that's totally       
        inappropriate."         

406
00:22:44,828 --> 00:22:46,328
     A, to behave that way.     

407
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:48,263
        And then, B, to         
      even talk about it.       

408
00:22:48,265 --> 00:22:51,166
      Do you ever get that      
       sense from hearing       

409
00:22:51,168 --> 00:22:53,235
   him describe these things?   

410
00:22:53,237 --> 00:22:56,972
  Well, I haven't had any real  
  deep conversations with him   

411
00:22:56,974 --> 00:22:58,306
    about any of that stuff.    

412
00:22:58,308 --> 00:23:02,444
    He hasn't told you those    
     things, those stories?     

413
00:23:02,446 --> 00:23:06,615
     I mean, I was there to     
   see that Susan was always    

414
00:23:06,617 --> 00:23:13,855
proud of her legs being cleanly 
waxed and how smooth they were. 

415
00:23:13,857 --> 00:23:17,392
         She would ask          
      people to feel them.      

416
00:23:17,394 --> 00:23:20,361
    I told her I thought it     
   was pretty inappropriate.    

417
00:23:20,363 --> 00:23:23,064
    KEITH MORRISON: Josh was    
     siding with his father     

418
00:23:23,066 --> 00:23:25,433
       against just about       
         everyone else.         

419
00:23:25,435 --> 00:23:27,569
A fateful choice it turned out. 

420
00:23:27,571 --> 00:23:30,872
        And what you're         
      telling me is that,       

421
00:23:30,874 --> 00:23:35,043
  that story, or those stories  
  rather, as told by your dad,  

422
00:23:35,045 --> 00:23:36,811
         are accurate.          

423
00:23:36,813 --> 00:23:41,249
And the stories told by Jennifer
  Graves and Susan's friends,   

424
00:23:41,251 --> 00:23:43,618
    that Susan was horrified    
       by this and wanted       

425
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,621
   to get the heck away from    
    it as much as she could,    

426
00:23:46,623 --> 00:23:49,424
  that those stories are lies.  

427
00:23:49,426 --> 00:23:50,558
          That's right.         

428
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:55,530
        So, on that night       
       in December, 2009,       

429
00:23:55,532 --> 00:23:57,999
      when you went out to      
    the desert with the kids    

430
00:23:58,001 --> 00:24:04,071
      to go camping, what       
       happened to Susan?       

431
00:24:04,073 --> 00:24:08,409
          I think that          
       Susan simply left.       

432
00:24:08,411 --> 00:24:09,310
         "Simply left."         

433
00:24:12,348 --> 00:24:14,915
   I mean, just at midnight,    
    1 o'clock in the morning    

434
00:24:14,917 --> 00:24:16,884
    just, "I've had enough.     

435
00:24:16,886 --> 00:24:18,819
       I'm out of here."        

436
00:24:18,821 --> 00:24:21,455
   Was she angry those days?    

437
00:24:21,457 --> 00:24:22,256
              Nope.             

438
00:24:22,258 --> 00:24:23,557
       Was she distressed?      

439
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:24,858
              Nope.             

440
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,895
       Did she continue to      
   assert that she loved you?   

441
00:24:27,897 --> 00:24:29,396
              Yeah.             

442
00:24:29,398 --> 00:24:34,735
    And, God knows, she must    
   have loved your children.    

443
00:24:34,737 --> 00:24:35,936
              Yeah.             

444
00:24:35,938 --> 00:24:39,339
        And yet, she, at        
     midnight or 1 o'clock      

445
00:24:39,341 --> 00:24:42,643
  or 2 o'clock in the morning   
    that night in December,     

446
00:24:42,645 --> 00:24:46,680
     got up out of her bed      
      and went downstairs       

447
00:24:46,682 --> 00:24:49,683
      and got on a bicycle      
         or something,          

448
00:24:49,685 --> 00:24:51,485
  or walked, and simply left.   

449
00:24:55,190 --> 00:25:00,894
    And has never, you know,    
  hasn't even sent you a note   

450
00:25:00,896 --> 00:25:02,763
 to suggest she's still alive.  

451
00:25:02,765 --> 00:25:04,931
    Is that what's happened?    

452
00:25:04,933 --> 00:25:07,234
       I don't know what's      
        happened to her.        

453
00:25:07,236 --> 00:25:08,969
   I don't know where she is.   

454
00:25:08,971 --> 00:25:11,905
        It's the genuine        
       belief, obviously,       

455
00:25:11,907 --> 00:25:14,908
         of a good many         
      people who have been      

456
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:20,180
     following this strange     
   saga, that you killed her.   

457
00:25:20,182 --> 00:25:22,649
   That's the allegation that   
    a lot of people believe.    

458
00:25:22,651 --> 00:25:27,086
  What can you say to them to   
 make them change their minds?  

459
00:25:27,088 --> 00:25:29,556
    I've never hurt my wife.    

460
00:25:29,558 --> 00:25:34,527
  I've never, never hurt her.   

461
00:25:34,529 --> 00:25:36,062
      KEITH MORRISON: And       
        still he claimed        

462
00:25:36,064 --> 00:25:40,967
Susan's parents were out to get 
him, to take his children away. 

463
00:25:40,969 --> 00:25:44,237
       They started to try      
    to say that my sons are     

464
00:25:44,239 --> 00:25:45,538
      in an emotionally--       

465
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:56,816
 some kind of emotional danger  
   from being in my custody.    

466
00:25:56,818 --> 00:25:59,619
    And that's a completely     
       unfair statement.        

467
00:25:59,621 --> 00:26:02,121
 KEITH MORRISON: And that's why 
  he did what he did, he said,  

468
00:26:02,123 --> 00:26:05,958
when he and the boys encountered
 Chuck Cox at a hardware store  

469
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,694
       a few months after       
       Susan disappeared.       

470
00:26:08,696 --> 00:26:13,833
     He said that he wanted     
      to hug my children.       

471
00:26:13,835 --> 00:26:15,701
   I said, "No, you may not."   

472
00:26:15,703 --> 00:26:18,771
  Those are his grandchildren,  
 just as they're your children. 

473
00:26:18,773 --> 00:26:20,773
       I mean, shouldn't        
        a grandfather be        

474
00:26:20,775 --> 00:26:23,242
 able to hug his grandchildren? 

475
00:26:23,244 --> 00:26:26,879
     He should not be using     
  them as pawns in the media.   

476
00:26:26,881 --> 00:26:29,214
         I love my sons         
      more than anything.       

477
00:26:29,216 --> 00:26:30,716
       I put them first.        

478
00:26:30,718 --> 00:26:33,519
     I put my family first.     

479
00:26:33,521 --> 00:26:36,555
   KEITH MORRISON: Words that   
    now ring horribly false,    

480
00:26:36,557 --> 00:26:39,658
     of course, as do these     
       about his missing        

481
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:42,494
 wife and their two young sons. 

482
00:26:42,496 --> 00:26:44,596
What do you tell them about her?

483
00:26:44,598 --> 00:26:47,532
    I just tell them that we    
   don't know where she's at.   

484
00:26:47,534 --> 00:26:50,302
       Do they understand?      

485
00:26:50,304 --> 00:26:51,837
       How much of it do        
        they understand?        

486
00:26:55,075 --> 00:27:01,780
          I think they          
    understand quite a bit.     

487
00:27:01,782 --> 00:27:04,115
     KEITH MORRISON: Indeed     
     it now seems they did.     

488
00:27:04,117 --> 00:27:08,086
   And that too would play a    
    role in what was coming.    

489
00:27:08,088 --> 00:27:09,721
       Do you worry that        
      somebody will charge      

490
00:27:09,723 --> 00:27:11,723
        you with a crime        
       that will prevent        

491
00:27:11,725 --> 00:27:13,491
   you from being with them?    

492
00:27:13,493 --> 00:27:16,194
              Nope.             

493
00:27:16,196 --> 00:27:18,796
         You don't think        
    that's going to happen?     

494
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:19,597
              Nope.             

495
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:21,532
     What makes you so sure?    

496
00:27:21,534 --> 00:27:25,403
       Because I never did      
  anything that someone would   

497
00:27:25,405 --> 00:27:26,904
   be able to charge me with.   

498
00:27:26,906 --> 00:27:29,574
      I never hurt Susan.       

499
00:27:29,576 --> 00:27:32,710
    And I had nothing to do     
    with her disappearance.     

500
00:27:32,712 --> 00:27:35,279
     KEITH MORRISON: Did he     
   know how few believed him?   

501
00:27:35,281 --> 00:27:38,683
 In the end it hardly mattered  
  because when police entered   

502
00:27:38,685 --> 00:27:40,651
      the secret places in      
      his father's house,       

503
00:27:40,653 --> 00:27:43,921
      they found evidence       
     of crimes, all right.      

504
00:27:43,923 --> 00:27:46,757
      Not the crimes they       
       were looking for,        

505
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:51,262
    but enough to push Josh     
      Powell to the brink.      

506
00:27:51,264 --> 00:27:52,530
  NATALIE MORALES: Coming up.   

507
00:27:52,532 --> 00:27:55,099
      There are some videos     
     and pictures of Susan.     

508
00:27:55,101 --> 00:27:57,801
Somebody was hiding and shooting
  through curtains and doors.   

509
00:27:57,803 --> 00:27:59,637
        NATALIE MORALES:        
     Family secrets emerge      

510
00:27:59,639 --> 00:28:01,205
   when "Dateline" continues.   

511
00:28:19,257 --> 00:28:21,291
 That rocking chair would look  
    great in our new house.     

512
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,526
      Ahh, New house, eh?       

513
00:28:22,595 --> 00:28:24,161
Well, you should definitely see 
           how GEICO            

514
00:28:24,229 --> 00:28:26,163
     could help you save on     
     homeowners insurance.      

515
00:28:26,231 --> 00:28:28,799
  Nice tip. I'll give you two   
      bucks for the chair.      

516
00:28:28,867 --> 00:28:31,802
    Two?! That's a Victorian    
            antique!            

517
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:34,070
  All right, how much for the   
        recliner, then?         

518
00:28:34,139 --> 00:28:36,907
 Wait wait... how did that get  
           out here?            

519
00:28:36,975 --> 00:28:38,942
That is definitely not for sale!

520
00:28:39,011 --> 00:28:40,343
      Is this a yard sale?      

521
00:28:40,412 --> 00:28:43,179
If it's in the yard then it's...
           for sale.            

522
00:28:43,248 --> 00:28:44,447

        Charlie, there's        
       a cave over there.       

558
00:31:43,459 --> 00:31:45,358
  KEITH MORRISON: When we met   
    Josh Powell in Puyallup,    

559
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,360
         Washington, he         
       and his dad Steven       

560
00:31:47,362 --> 00:31:49,596
       invited us to join       
        them and Charlie        

561
00:31:49,598 --> 00:31:52,065
 and Braden on a family outing. 

562
00:31:52,067 --> 00:31:53,466
      It was summer, 2011.      

563
00:31:53,468 --> 00:31:54,834
JOSH POWELL: All right, come on.

564
00:31:54,836 --> 00:31:56,369
     KEITH MORRISON: And a      
  casual observer might never   

565
00:31:56,371 --> 00:31:58,071
        have guessed the        
       circumstances that       

566
00:31:58,073 --> 00:32:01,207
 brought these two strange men  
 and two little boys together.  

567
00:32:01,209 --> 00:32:03,877
The kids appeared normal, happy.

568
00:32:03,879 --> 00:32:07,180
  But of course, by then, for   
  more than a year and a half   

569
00:32:07,182 --> 00:32:09,182
      they'd been missing       
  someone very dear to them--   

570
00:32:09,184 --> 00:32:11,217
  their mother, Susan Powell.   

571
00:32:11,219 --> 00:32:13,753
      And Susan's parents       
      were sure Josh knew       

572
00:32:13,755 --> 00:32:15,822
 exactly what happened to her.  

573
00:32:15,824 --> 00:32:20,359
    When did you first think    
    that Josh killed Susan?     

574
00:32:20,361 --> 00:32:24,430
  Probably when he came up with 
 this "I went camping" routine. 

575
00:32:24,432 --> 00:32:25,665
      KEITH MORRISON: But       
       there was not yet        

576
00:32:25,667 --> 00:32:27,934
 enough evidence to charge him. 

577
00:32:27,936 --> 00:32:30,770
     And then, as Josh and      
     I talked that evening      

578
00:32:30,772 --> 00:32:33,806
   at the end of August, the    
police raided his father's house

579
00:32:33,808 --> 00:32:35,307
       looking for more.        

580
00:32:35,309 --> 00:32:39,545
And they did find evidence, but 
 not at all what they expected. 

581
00:32:39,547 --> 00:32:41,747
       Well, we discovered      
       a lot of computers       

582
00:32:41,749 --> 00:32:43,849
     and a lot of material.     

583
00:32:43,851 --> 00:32:45,918
  KEITH MORRISON: Ed Troyer of  
  the Pierce County Sheriff's   

584
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,886
     Department describing      
        what was seized         

585
00:32:47,888 --> 00:32:49,455
   from Steven Powell's home.   

586
00:32:49,457 --> 00:32:51,190
      There was some child      
     pornography in there,      

587
00:32:51,192 --> 00:32:54,393
and there were some voyeuristic 
      pictures and videos.      

588
00:32:54,395 --> 00:32:57,629
  KEITH MORRISON: And not just  
filth dug up from the internet, 

589
00:32:57,631 --> 00:33:02,367
  but rather material someone   
 had filmed himself, in secret. 

590
00:33:02,369 --> 00:33:04,903
       That someone, said       
   Troyer, was Steven Powell.   

591
00:33:04,905 --> 00:33:08,240
    Pictures and videos that    
   were taken from his house    

592
00:33:08,242 --> 00:33:10,142
      into the neighbor's       
     house of little girls      

593
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:15,247
 using bathroom, showers, shot  
   right from his own window.   

594
00:33:15,249 --> 00:33:17,349
   KEITH MORRISON: Steven was   
 arrested, hauled off to jail,  

595
00:33:17,351 --> 00:33:19,885
      and charged with 14       
      counts of voyeurism       

596
00:33:19,887 --> 00:33:23,788
  and one count of possessing   
  child pornography, a felony.  

597
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:26,558
  I've been asked to plead not  
 guilty related to all charges. 

598
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,227
  KEITH MORRISON: This was the  
 same Steven Powell, remember,  

599
00:33:29,229 --> 00:33:31,997
who claimed his daughter-in-law 
   Susan had a serious crush    

600
00:33:31,999 --> 00:33:34,165
 on him before she disappeared. 

601
00:33:34,167 --> 00:33:38,336
  When he said it, it sounded   
  like an old fool's fantasy.   

602
00:33:38,338 --> 00:33:40,505
    Now it turned out there     
    was evidence the fantasy    

603
00:33:40,507 --> 00:33:43,641
 had a very dark undercurrent.  

604
00:33:43,643 --> 00:33:47,045
   Because there was another    
face, a familiar one, in Steven 

605
00:33:47,047 --> 00:33:49,147
 Powell's homemade porn stash.  

606
00:33:49,149 --> 00:33:51,149
       Tell me about the        
    discovery of the videos     

607
00:33:51,151 --> 00:33:53,017
    involving Susan Powell.     

608
00:33:53,019 --> 00:33:55,987
      There are some videos     
     and pictures of Susan      

609
00:33:55,989 --> 00:33:58,990
      that were obviously       
   taken without her consent    

610
00:33:58,992 --> 00:34:00,258
       or her knowledge.        

611
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,626
      Somebody was hiding       
        and taking them,        

612
00:34:01,628 --> 00:34:02,960
        shooting through        
       curtains and doors       

613
00:34:02,962 --> 00:34:04,495
  and taking pictures of her.   

614
00:34:04,497 --> 00:34:06,097
 KEITH MORRISON: It had to have 
 happened early in the marriage 

615
00:34:06,099 --> 00:34:09,500
 when Susan and Josh, strapped  
 for cash, moved in with Steven 

616
00:34:09,502 --> 00:34:10,835
          for a while.          

617
00:34:10,837 --> 00:34:13,804
       And, you know, even      
  though he said that she was   

618
00:34:13,806 --> 00:34:17,241
 interested in him, we believe  
  that's all one big fantasy,   

619
00:34:17,243 --> 00:34:19,443
and she absolutely despised him.

620
00:34:19,445 --> 00:34:21,412
  KEITH MORRISON: The charges   
 brought against Steven Powell  

621
00:34:21,414 --> 00:34:23,747
   in 2011 were ugly enough.    

622
00:34:23,749 --> 00:34:27,851
  But before long, they set in  
 motion something much bigger-- 

623
00:34:27,853 --> 00:34:31,155
  a full-on battle for control  
     of Charlie and Braden.     

624
00:34:31,157 --> 00:34:33,357
    We were able to take the    
   kids out of the residence    

625
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:36,293
   until an investigation was   
    done, and the kids were     

626
00:34:36,295 --> 00:34:38,095
  placed with Susan's parents.  

627
00:34:38,097 --> 00:34:40,664
    KEITH MORRISON: Susan's     
  parents, Chuck and Judy Cox,  

628
00:34:40,666 --> 00:34:42,966
  in Josh and Steven's world--  

629
00:34:42,968 --> 00:34:44,268
           the enemy.           

630
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:45,769
    I had Braden in the back,   
    it was before preschool,    

631
00:34:45,771 --> 00:34:47,170
     and we're driving and      
       he says, "Grandpa,       

632
00:34:47,172 --> 00:34:48,605
 you need to change your name." 

633
00:34:48,607 --> 00:34:49,406
           Well, why?           

634
00:34:49,408 --> 00:34:51,308
     My name's Charles Cox.     

635
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:52,809
        He says, "Yeah.         

636
00:34:52,811 --> 00:34:55,178
      Charles Cox is a bad      
       person, and so you       

637
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,646
   need to change your name."   

638
00:34:56,648 --> 00:34:58,315
        Who says Charles        
      Cox is a bad person?      

639
00:34:58,317 --> 00:34:59,516
        "Oh, my daddy."         

640
00:34:59,518 --> 00:35:00,817
      KEITH MORRISON: Josh      
      had done everything       

641
00:35:00,819 --> 00:35:05,021
   he could to keep Chuck and   
    Judy away from his sons.    

642
00:35:05,023 --> 00:35:07,157
  Now they had the upper hand.  

643
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:11,494
    My clients believe it is    
very harmful for these children 

644
00:35:11,496 --> 00:35:16,065
  to have been in the home of   
  Steven Powell who was deeply  

645
00:35:16,067 --> 00:35:18,701
   involved with pornography.   

646
00:35:18,703 --> 00:35:20,303
    KEITH MORRISON: At this     
    hearing that September,     

647
00:35:20,305 --> 00:35:23,206
    Josh Powell represented     
    himself in family court.    

648
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:26,142
  Denied any knowledge of his   
    father's alleged crimes.    

649
00:35:26,144 --> 00:35:28,711
      Promised to keep the      
     boys away from Steven,     

650
00:35:28,713 --> 00:35:30,980
    should the elder Powell     
       somehow make bail.       

651
00:35:30,982 --> 00:35:34,250
   But here you could almost    
      see Josh unraveling.      

652
00:35:34,252 --> 00:35:37,286
         I am a fit and         
       qualified father.        

653
00:35:37,288 --> 00:35:39,055
    I am the natural father.    

654
00:35:39,057 --> 00:35:42,258
        I love my sons.         

655
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:45,895
 And the manner in which they-- 

656
00:35:49,901 --> 00:35:51,367
        [exhales loudly]        

657
00:35:51,369 --> 00:35:56,505
      The manner in which       
       they were behaving       

658
00:35:56,507 --> 00:35:59,408
    leads me to believe that    
   the irreparable harm that    

659
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:02,811
    is occurring to my sons     
    is having taken them out    

660
00:36:02,813 --> 00:36:05,047
 of the stable and happy home.  

661
00:36:05,049 --> 00:36:06,782
   KEITH MORRISON: But then a   
   prosecutor told the judge    

662
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:09,218
   that so far, only a small    
    portion of the evidence     

663
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,452
       had been examined.       

664
00:36:10,454 --> 00:36:12,588
     And while Josh Powell      
    hadn't been charged yet,    

665
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:14,289
       he still might be.       

666
00:36:14,291 --> 00:36:17,860
     Mr. Powell is a subject    
     of that investigation,     

667
00:36:17,862 --> 00:36:19,895
     and that's the concern     
    that the department has.    

668
00:36:19,897 --> 00:36:21,930
       KEITH MORRISON: So       
      Josh lost that round      

669
00:36:21,932 --> 00:36:25,867
and lost the ones that followed,
  including the very last one.  

670
00:36:25,869 --> 00:36:28,370
     The final defeat came      
     when the judge ordered     

671
00:36:28,372 --> 00:36:30,405
      that the boys could       
      stay with the Coxes       

672
00:36:30,407 --> 00:36:33,241
 for at least six more months.  

673
00:36:33,243 --> 00:36:35,877
         So you got that        
       favorable ruling.        

674
00:36:35,879 --> 00:36:36,778
        Favorable ruling.       

675
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,446
        A very good day.        

676
00:36:38,448 --> 00:36:40,682
         Except Josh is         
      still not arrested.       

677
00:36:40,684 --> 00:36:42,617
 Our daughter's still missing.  

678
00:36:42,619 --> 00:36:44,753
      KEITH MORRISON: But       
       those facts might        

679
00:36:44,755 --> 00:36:48,623
 have changed too with a second 
ruling from the judge that day. 

680
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:50,525
        She ordered Josh        
       Powell to undergo        

681
00:36:50,527 --> 00:36:52,961
   a psychosexual evaluation.   

682
00:36:52,963 --> 00:36:54,195
              Why?              

683
00:36:54,197 --> 00:36:56,197
     Because, according to      
      Utah investigators,       

684
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:59,200
   some images had been found   
   on a computer in his home    

685
00:36:59,202 --> 00:37:02,437
     back in 2009, the year     
       Susan disappeared.       

686
00:37:02,439 --> 00:37:03,938
        It was cartoons.        

687
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,606
        The cartoons and        
       the animation are        

688
00:37:05,608 --> 00:37:08,176
 of adults and kids having sex. 

689
00:37:08,178 --> 00:37:10,745
      KEITH MORRISON: And       
       Josh's evaluation        

690
00:37:10,747 --> 00:37:14,982
   was to include a polygraph   
     test, a lie detector.      

691
00:37:14,984 --> 00:37:17,818
         He had lost the        
      custody of the kids,      

692
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,887
       he had to undergo        
        a lie detector.         

693
00:37:19,889 --> 00:37:21,522
         And what's he          
      going to tell them?       

694
00:37:21,524 --> 00:37:26,327
  And if they ask about Susan,  
    with a lie detector on--    

695
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:27,795
     Which they would have.     

696
00:37:27,797 --> 00:37:30,498
   Which they would have, he's  
  not going to be able to lie.  

697
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:34,368
      I just saw that as,       
     this is going to be--      

698
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:36,103
    he has no way he's going    
      to get through this.      

699
00:37:36,105 --> 00:37:37,571
       The trap was really      
     closing in around him.     

700
00:37:37,573 --> 00:37:38,472
              Yeah.             

701
00:37:38,474 --> 00:37:40,007
 He's feeling really closed in. 

702
00:37:40,009 --> 00:37:42,676
    KEITH MORRISON: And, if     
  that wasn't pressure enough,  

703
00:37:42,678 --> 00:37:44,111
      there was this too.       

704
00:37:44,113 --> 00:37:46,246
      Rumors that Charlie       
        and Braden were         

705
00:37:46,248 --> 00:37:48,782
   getting pretty comfortable   
    with their grandparents.    

706
00:37:48,784 --> 00:37:52,386
  That they'd started talking   
  about that midnight camping   

707
00:37:52,388 --> 00:37:54,221
             trip.              

708
00:37:54,223 --> 00:37:55,522
        NATALIE MORALES:        
       Just how much did        

709
00:37:55,524 --> 00:37:58,292
   the boys know about their    
    mother's disappearance?     

710
00:37:58,294 --> 00:38:00,694
   A secret is soon revealed.   

711
00:38:00,696 --> 00:38:01,995
           Coming up.           

712
00:38:01,997 --> 00:38:04,297
    He was explained, "Well,    
    mother's in the trunk."     

713
00:38:04,299 --> 00:38:05,499
        NATALIE MORALES:        
      And new information       

714
00:38:05,501 --> 00:38:08,034
   emerges about Josh's past.   

715
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,170
       There was a warning      
        sign, way early.        

716
00:38:10,172 --> 00:38:11,605
     NATALIE MORALES: When      
     "Dateline" continues.      

717
00:38:47,674 --> 00:38:49,408
        I'M ALEX TREBEK         
        HERE TO TELL YOU        

718
00:38:49,477 --> 00:38:51,544
ABOUT THE COLONIAL PENN PROGRAM.

719
00:38:51,613 --> 00:38:53,613
      IF YOU'RE AGE 50-85       

720
00:38:53,681 --> 00:38:55,147
     AND LOOKING                
     TO BUY LIFE INSURANCE      

721
00:38:55,216 --> 00:38:58,417
    ON A FIXED BUDGET,          
    REMEMBER THE THREE P'S.     

722
00:38:58,486 --> 00:38:59,785
        THE THREE WHAT?         

723
00:38:59,854 --> 00:39:00,953
         THE THREE P'S?         

724
00:39:01,022 --> 00:39:02,555
    WHAT ARE THE THREE P'S?     

725
00:39:02,623 --> 00:39:05,090
THE THREE P'S OF LIFE INSURANCE 
ON A FIXED BUDGET               

726
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:08,527
  ARE PRICE, PRICE, AND PRICE.  

727
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:12,731
  A PRICE YOU CAN AFFORD,       
  A PRICE THAT CAN'T INCREASE,  

728
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,800
     AND A PRICE                
     THAT FITS YOUR BUDGET.     

729
00:39:14,869 --> 00:39:17,936
       I'M 54 AND I WAS         
       A SMOKER BUT QUIT.       

730
00:39:18,005 --> 00:39:19,705
     ALEX, WHAT'S MY PRICE?     

731
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:22,875
      YOU CAN GET COVERAGE      
      FOR $9.95 A MONTH.        

732
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:26,178
     I'M 65, RETIRED,           
     AND TAKE MEDICATIONS.      

733
00:39:26,247 --> 00:39:27,346
        WHAT'S MY PRICE?        

734
00:39:27,414 --> 00:39:29,648
      ALSO $9.95 A MONTH.       

735
00:39:29,717 --> 00:39:32,784
   I JUST TURNED 80             
   AND I'M ON A FIXED INCOME.   

736
00:39:32,853 --> 00:39:34,419
        WHAT'S MY PRICE?        

737
00:39:34,488 --> 00:39:37,155
  $9.95 A MONTH FOR YOU, TOO.   

738
00:39:37,224 --> 00:39:39,291
    IF YOU'RE AGE 50 TO 85,

     KEITH MORRISON: Steven     
 Powell was arrested for child  

768
00:41:52,991 --> 00:41:55,992
pornography in September, 2011. 

769
00:41:55,994 --> 00:41:58,394
Josh Powell was under suspicion.

770
00:41:58,396 --> 00:42:00,663
         And as autumn          
     deepened into winter,      

771
00:42:00,665 --> 00:42:03,399
       Chuck and Judy Cox       
     heard again and again,     

772
00:42:03,401 --> 00:42:05,167
      "The arrest of Josh       
        Powell was next.        

773
00:42:05,169 --> 00:42:07,570
   It could happen any day."    

774
00:42:07,572 --> 00:42:10,139
        So they waited,         
       held their breath,       

775
00:42:10,141 --> 00:42:13,809
     and took in the boys,      
      Charlie and Braden.       

776
00:42:13,811 --> 00:42:17,079
    How was it, living with     
   those boys for the months    

777
00:42:17,081 --> 00:42:18,280
         you had them?          

778
00:42:18,282 --> 00:42:19,815
      How about exhausting.     

779
00:42:19,817 --> 00:42:20,950
              Yeah.             

780
00:42:20,952 --> 00:42:23,252
         We went to bed         
     exhausted every night.     

781
00:42:23,254 --> 00:42:26,488
      But it felt good to       
      have the kids there.      

782
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:27,956
      KEITH MORRISON: The       
    Coxes were much stricter    

783
00:42:27,958 --> 00:42:29,458
   disciplinarians than Josh.   

784
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:31,894
      They enforced early       
  bedtimes and regular meals.   

785
00:42:31,896 --> 00:42:35,063
    And, according to Josh's    
   sister and brother-in-law,   

786
00:42:35,065 --> 00:42:36,865
       the kids thrived.        

787
00:42:36,867 --> 00:42:38,233
         Right after the        
        custody hearing,        

788
00:42:38,235 --> 00:42:39,835
    where they were finally     
       in the Cox's home,       

789
00:42:39,837 --> 00:42:42,571
        we saw them that        
       day and they were        

790
00:42:42,573 --> 00:42:45,941
 withdrawn and angry and quiet. 

791
00:42:45,943 --> 00:42:48,810
   And then two months later,   
   they were sitting on laps    

792
00:42:48,812 --> 00:42:50,912
    and hugging and playing     
   and listening while people   

793
00:42:50,914 --> 00:42:52,447
     read stories to them.      

794
00:42:52,449 --> 00:42:54,482
      And they were acting      
     more like little boys.     

795
00:42:54,484 --> 00:42:56,918
         We're also very        
   concerned for the welfare    

796
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,453
     of our grandchildren.      

797
00:42:58,455 --> 00:43:00,455
 KEITH MORRISON: Chuck and Judy 
 were determined to keep them.  

798
00:43:00,457 --> 00:43:03,391
      And as they battled       
     Josh in family court,      

799
00:43:03,393 --> 00:43:05,927
       they began to turn       
     up new and disturbing      

800
00:43:05,929 --> 00:43:08,930
   information about the man    
  who married their daughter.   

801
00:43:08,932 --> 00:43:12,767
  They found it in the divorce  
 papers of his father, Steven.  

802
00:43:12,769 --> 00:43:14,802
           Right after          
      Steve was arrested,       

803
00:43:14,804 --> 00:43:18,406
    we went over to Spokane     
   and pulled up the record.    

804
00:43:18,408 --> 00:43:20,742
   KEITH MORRISON: There were   
disturbing allegations in there 

805
00:43:20,744 --> 00:43:25,012
that Josh had attempted suicide 
   by hanging as a teenager.    

806
00:43:25,014 --> 00:43:27,648
     That he had threatened     
    his mother with a knife.    

807
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:31,419
    And there was this story    
     about Josh and Steven.     

808
00:43:31,421 --> 00:43:35,923
      There was an incident     
 where Josh killed his younger  

809
00:43:35,925 --> 00:43:38,125
         sister Alina's         
     hamster by smashing it     

810
00:43:38,127 --> 00:43:39,760
 against the side of the cage.  

811
00:43:39,762 --> 00:43:42,263
And Josh's mother was outraged. 

812
00:43:42,265 --> 00:43:48,035
And Steve's response, according 
    to the papers there was,    

813
00:43:48,037 --> 00:43:51,171
       "She just does not       
   understand teenage humor."   

814
00:43:51,173 --> 00:43:52,006
        "Teenage humor."        

815
00:43:52,008 --> 00:43:52,806
         Teenage humor.         

816
00:43:52,808 --> 00:43:56,143
      And I'm going, huh?       

817
00:43:56,145 --> 00:43:57,711
       What on earth are        
       you talking about?       

818
00:43:57,713 --> 00:44:01,015
  And one of the first things   
     I've heard for killers     

819
00:44:01,017 --> 00:44:04,151
       is that they abuse       
    animals or kill animals.    

820
00:44:04,153 --> 00:44:07,621
    And there was a warning     
       signs, way early.        

821
00:44:07,623 --> 00:44:09,523
   KEITH MORRISON: Of course,   
 they believed he was a killer, 

822
00:44:09,525 --> 00:44:12,826
had killed their daughter, even 
 though he hadn't been charged. 

823
00:44:12,828 --> 00:44:16,930
     And then they say the      
     kids began to open up.     

824
00:44:16,932 --> 00:44:20,534
     One of them told me one    
 time, I think it was Charlie,  

825
00:44:20,536 --> 00:44:23,503
    that he hoped Mommy knew    
    how to camp or something    

826
00:44:23,505 --> 00:44:27,641
 because she was out where she  
  needed to know how to camp.   

827
00:44:27,643 --> 00:44:29,209
    KEITH MORRISON: And they    
     heard about an earlier     

828
00:44:29,211 --> 00:44:31,678
       episode, where one       
        of the boys drew        

829
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,580
  a picture at his preschool.   

830
00:44:33,582 --> 00:44:36,216
       He drew a car, two       
        boys, and a dad.        

831
00:44:36,218 --> 00:44:37,150
            No mom.             

832
00:44:37,152 --> 00:44:39,019
The teacher asked where she was.

833
00:44:39,021 --> 00:44:41,454
        Well, mother's in       
      the trunk, you know.      

834
00:44:41,456 --> 00:44:44,224
   And they knew who he was.    

835
00:44:44,226 --> 00:44:46,059
 KEITH MORRISON: All the while, 
    even though the boys now    

836
00:44:46,061 --> 00:44:49,696
lived with the Coxes, they made 
  court-ordered visits to Josh  

837
00:44:49,698 --> 00:44:51,397
  at the house he was renting.  

838
00:44:51,399 --> 00:44:55,001
    A house, police now say,    
   he didn't really live in.    

839
00:44:55,003 --> 00:44:56,936
       We believe that the      
     house was staged just      

840
00:44:56,938 --> 00:44:59,539
        for the purpose         
       of the visitation        

841
00:44:59,541 --> 00:45:02,375
 and to make himself look like  
   a good dad with the photos   

842
00:45:02,377 --> 00:45:05,211
     on the wall, the kid's     
       stuff, the minivan       

843
00:45:05,213 --> 00:45:07,079
in the driveway and the garage. 

844
00:45:07,081 --> 00:45:11,250
     And, unfortunately, it     
    was everything but that.    

845
00:45:11,252 --> 00:45:13,552
     KEITH MORRISON: Where      
    did Josh actually live?     

846
00:45:13,554 --> 00:45:15,187
        Steven's house.         

847
00:45:15,189 --> 00:45:17,757
    And now that Josh seemed    
  in danger of losing custody   

848
00:45:17,759 --> 00:45:19,925
          of the kids           
    permanently, Chuck says     

849
00:45:19,927 --> 00:45:22,528
      he worried not about      
        the boys so much        

850
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:26,499
  but about the social worker   
   who took them to see Josh.   

851
00:45:26,501 --> 00:45:32,104
   I was concerned that if she  
  confronted Josh in any way,   

852
00:45:32,106 --> 00:45:35,474
    that he might hurt her.     

853
00:45:35,476 --> 00:45:38,677
  KEITH MORRISON: Which brings  
 us inexorably to that Sunday,  

854
00:45:38,679 --> 00:45:41,680
    the first time the kids     
 would visit Josh after he was  

855
00:45:41,682 --> 00:45:43,682
 ordered to take the polygraph. 

856
00:45:43,684 --> 00:45:45,717
           I got a bad          
      feeling about this.       

857
00:45:45,719 --> 00:45:48,153
 And I didn't really get a bad  
  feeling till like Saturday.   

858
00:45:48,155 --> 00:45:51,890
   I was thinking, you know,    
  maybe I should ask somebody   

859
00:45:51,892 --> 00:45:54,893
     to have a little more      
      security this time,       

860
00:45:54,895 --> 00:45:56,895
       or maybe we should       
        skip this visit.        

861
00:45:56,897 --> 00:45:58,730
    KEITH MORRISON: The kids    
    were having fun playing.    

862
00:45:58,732 --> 00:46:00,298
       Didn't want to go.       

863
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,300
     But, of course, there      
        wasn't a choice.        

864
00:46:02,302 --> 00:46:03,769
        They had to go.         

865
00:46:03,771 --> 00:46:09,674
 I thought, "I have to get them 
  to go or I'm breaking a law,  

866
00:46:09,676 --> 00:46:11,943
        and we'll get in        
        trouble for it."        

867
00:46:11,945 --> 00:46:14,679
     KEITH MORRISON: And so     
   she jollied them into it.    

868
00:46:14,681 --> 00:46:16,848
         I said, "You'll        
       do something fun.        

869
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:18,983
        You know, Daddy         
      will have a project.      

870
00:46:18,985 --> 00:46:20,552
 You'll get to eat with Daddy.  

871
00:46:20,554 --> 00:46:22,020
       You'll have fun."        

872
00:46:22,022 --> 00:46:25,557
  KEITH MORRISON: No idea, of   
course, about the careful plans 

873
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:28,393
      Josh had been making      
        for that visit.         

874
00:46:28,395 --> 00:46:29,694
  NATALIE MORALES: Coming up.   

875
00:46:29,696 --> 00:46:32,397
     When you listen to that    
   tape, it's almost painful.   

876
00:46:32,399 --> 00:46:33,932
       It's excruciating.       

877
00:46:33,934 --> 00:46:35,333
        NATALIE MORALES:        
      For the first time,       

878
00:46:35,335 --> 00:46:39,203
   the 911 dispatcher shares    
   his story about that day.    

879
00:46:39,205 --> 00:46:43,608
     I wish I had recognized    
 the urgency of the situation.  

880
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:44,408
     NATALIE MORALES: When      
     "Dateline" continues.      

881
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:48,513
    I thought I was managing    

882
00:46:48,581 --> 00:46:49,981
     my moderate to severe      
      ulcerative colitis.       

883
00:46:50,049 --> 00:46:52,817
    But I realized something    
         was missing...         

884
00:46:52,885 --> 00:46:53,985
              me.               

885
00:46:54,053 --> 00:46:55,586
       The thought of my        
       symptoms returning       

886
00:46:55,655 --> 00:46:57,054
was keeping me from being there 

887
00:46:57,123 --> 00:46:59,824
         for the people         
    and things I love most.     

888
00:46:59,892 --> 00:47:01,659
   So, I talked to my doctor    
          and learned           

889
00:47:01,727 --> 00:47:04,495
 HUMIRA can help get, and keep, 
        UC under control        

890
00:47:04,564 --> 00:47:06,330
 when other medications haven't 
      worked well enough.       

891
00:47:06,399 --> 00:47:09,166
  And it helps people achieve   
       control that lasts       

892
00:47:09,235 --> 00:47:11,502
 so you could experience few or 
          no symptoms.          

893
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:13,671
<i>HUMIRA can lower your ability to</i>
       <i> fight infections,</i>       

894
00:47:13,739 --> 00:47:15,005
    <i> including tuberculosis.</i>    

895
00:47:15,074 --> 00:47:17,341
    <i> Serious, sometimes fatal</i>

    <i> nervous system problems,</i>

00:47:21,414 --> 00:47:22,679
  <i> serious allergic reactions,</i>  

899

         <i> heart failure.</i>        

900

       <i> get tested for TB.</i>      

901
00:47:26,585 --> 00:47:28,018
<i>Tell your doctor if you've been</i> 
            <i> to areas</i>           

902
00:47:28,087 --> 00:47:29,853

          <i> are common,</i>          

903
00:47:29,922 --> 00:47:31,855
     <i> and if you've had TB,</i>     
          <i> hepatitis B,</i>

905
00:47:33,192 --> 00:47:34,858
   <i> or have flu-like symptoms</i>   
           <i> or sores.</i>           

906
00:47:34,927 --> 00:47:37,194
 <i> Don't start HUMIRA if you have</i>
         <i> an infection.</i>         

907
00:47:37,262 --> 00:47:39,362
  Be there for you, and them.   

908
00:47:39,431 --> 00:47:41,698
  Ask your gastroenterologist   
         about HUMIRA.          

909
00:47:41,767 --> 00:47:46,636
    With HUMIRA, control is     
           possible.            
         Bottom line is,        

910
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:48,672
  moms love that Land o' Frost  
      Premium sliced meats      

911
00:47:48,874 --> 00:47:50,540
      have no by-products.      

912

 [CONFERENCE PHONE] Baloney!    

913
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:53,643
      [CONFERENCE PHONE]        
      Has joined the call.      

914
00:47:53,645 --> 00:47:54,477
        Hey Baloney here.       

915
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:57,714
     I thought this was a       
     no by-products call?       

916
00:47:57,716 --> 00:49:58,065
    <i> Land O' Frost Premium.</i>     
       <i> A Slice Above.</i>          

917
00:49:58,067 --> 00:50:00,434
     I thought this was a       
     no by-products call?       

918
00:50:03,539 --> 00:50:04,772
   Welcome back to "Dateline."  

919
00:50:04,774 --> 00:50:06,140
      I'm Natalie Morales.      

920
00:50:06,142 --> 00:50:09,009
        Time was running        
      out for Josh Powell.      

921
00:50:09,011 --> 00:50:10,945
       Little Charlie and       
      Braden were starting      

922
00:50:10,947 --> 00:50:13,881
   to open up about the night   
   their mother disappeared.    

923
00:50:13,883 --> 00:50:17,785
 And meanwhile, a judge ordered 
   Josh to take a polygraph.    

924
00:50:17,787 --> 00:50:20,487
     But first, he planned      
        to see his boys,        

925
00:50:20,489 --> 00:50:22,723
       and who could have       
     predicted what a dark      

926
00:50:22,725 --> 00:50:24,925
  turn those plans would take.  

927
00:50:24,927 --> 00:50:28,095
  Now, to Keith Morrison, with  
 the conclusion of "A Family's  

928
00:50:28,097 --> 00:50:29,930
            Story."             

929
00:50:29,932 --> 00:50:31,832
    KEITH MORRISON: He was a    
  person of interest in Susan   

930
00:50:31,834 --> 00:50:33,767
    Powell's disappearance.     

931
00:50:33,769 --> 00:50:37,104
   The target of a relentless   
     police investigation.      

932
00:50:37,106 --> 00:50:39,873
 His contacts with his two sons 
had been reduced by court order 

933
00:50:39,875 --> 00:50:41,875
  to a few hours twice a week.  

934
00:50:41,877 --> 00:50:45,112
     Rumors of an imminent      
   arrest swirled around him.   

935
00:50:45,114 --> 00:50:48,148
      And Josh Powell was       
   preparing to strike back.    

936
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:51,785
  Hear what police have pieced  
  together of his final days.   

937
00:50:51,787 --> 00:50:55,088
        On February 4th,        
      2012, Josh deposited      

938
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:58,625
    his children's toys and     
 clothing in a charity drop box 

939
00:50:58,627 --> 00:51:00,393
        near his house.         

940
00:51:00,395 --> 00:51:03,496
         At 11:32 AM he         
       walked into a bank       

941
00:51:03,498 --> 00:51:07,534
where he withdrew $7,000 in cash
and transferred thousands more, 

942
00:51:07,536 --> 00:51:11,437
 police believe, to his sister  
  who was still close to him.   

943
00:51:11,439 --> 00:51:14,574
     At 1:30 PM he arrived      
     at this storage unit.      

944
00:51:14,576 --> 00:51:16,976
      Here, police say, he      
    spent an hour and a half    

945
00:51:16,978 --> 00:51:19,145
         going through          
      Susan's belongings.       

946
00:51:19,147 --> 00:51:21,714
       Then, back at his        
   minivan, he drove 10 miles   

947
00:51:21,716 --> 00:51:24,050
         out of town to         
      this landfill where       

948
00:51:24,052 --> 00:51:27,687
    he dumped the bundle of     
material from the storage unit. 

949
00:51:27,689 --> 00:51:30,590
     That evening he walked     
  into this department store,   

950
00:51:30,592 --> 00:51:34,560
 purchased two five-gallon gas  
  cans and a pack of Sterno--   

951
00:51:34,562 --> 00:51:36,796
       the stuff you use        
       to keep food hot.        

952
00:51:36,798 --> 00:51:40,666
     Then he went to a gas      
  station to fill those cans.   

953
00:51:40,668 --> 00:51:42,701
       The next morning,        
     Sunday, Josh composed      

954
00:51:42,703 --> 00:51:44,437
   emails to family members.    

955
00:51:44,439 --> 00:51:46,605
  Most just said, "I'm sorry.   

956
00:51:46,607 --> 00:51:48,207
           Goodbye."            

957
00:51:48,209 --> 00:51:50,476
     At 10:30 he called his     
   sister Alina's cell phone.   

958
00:51:50,478 --> 00:51:51,610
        JOSH POWELL (ON         
       RECORDING): Hello.       

959
00:51:51,612 --> 00:51:53,979
         This is Josh.          

960
00:51:53,981 --> 00:51:59,251
     And I'm-- I'm calling      
        to say goodbye.         

961
00:51:59,253 --> 00:52:05,224
        I am not able to        
     live without my sons.      

962
00:52:05,226 --> 00:52:10,562
        And I'm not able        
       to go on anymore.        

963
00:52:10,564 --> 00:52:12,898
I'm sorry to everyone I've hurt.

964
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,333
            Goodbye.            

965
00:52:14,335 --> 00:52:17,102
      KEITH MORRISON: His       
   alarmed sister called 911.   

966
00:52:17,104 --> 00:52:18,804
     ALINA POWELL: I think      
        my brother might        

967
00:52:18,806 --> 00:52:20,305
  be in trouble or something.   

968
00:52:20,307 --> 00:52:21,907
   911 OPERATOR: What's going   
     on with your brother?      

969
00:52:21,909 --> 00:52:22,741
     ALINA POWELL: He is--      

970
00:52:22,743 --> 00:52:23,575
         I don't know.          

971
00:52:23,577 --> 00:52:24,709
   He's sending weird emails.   

972
00:52:24,711 --> 00:52:27,145
 He's saying goodbye and stuff. 

973
00:52:27,147 --> 00:52:29,981
 KEITH MORRISON: And then, Josh 
doused the house with gasoline. 

974
00:52:29,983 --> 00:52:32,317
      Prepared the axe he       
     would use on the boys      

975
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:34,285
    before he lit the match.    

976
00:52:34,287 --> 00:52:36,821
 Around noon, the social worker 
 brought Charlie and Braden for 

977
00:52:36,823 --> 00:52:38,823
their court-ordered visitation. 

978
00:52:38,825 --> 00:52:42,427
 Josh grabbed the boys, pulled  
  them inside, locked her out.  

979
00:52:42,429 --> 00:52:45,330
     At 12:08 she made her      
       first call to 911.       

980
00:52:45,332 --> 00:52:46,798
      SOCIAL WORKER: Hey.       

981
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,968
 I'm on a supervised visitation 
   for a court-ordered visit,   

982
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:52,337
      and something really      
      weird has happened.       

983
00:52:52,339 --> 00:52:54,572
     The kids went into the     
     house and the parent--     

984
00:52:54,574 --> 00:52:57,141
     the biological parent,     
  whose name is Josh Powell--   

985
00:52:57,143 --> 00:52:59,243
  will not let me in the door.  

986
00:52:59,245 --> 00:53:00,411
       What should I do?        

987
00:53:00,413 --> 00:53:01,479
      KEITH MORRISON: And       
       the operator kept        

988
00:53:01,481 --> 00:53:03,481
        her on the line         
      answering questions       

989
00:53:03,483 --> 00:53:05,182
   for nearly seven minutes.    

990
00:53:05,184 --> 00:53:07,084
  911 OPERATOR: Date of birth?  

991
00:53:07,086 --> 00:53:08,019
  SOCIAL WORKER: I don't know.  

992
00:53:08,021 --> 00:53:09,453
         He's about 39.         

993
00:53:09,455 --> 00:53:11,422
    911 OPERATOR: How tall?     

994
00:53:11,424 --> 00:53:15,960
       SOCIAL WORKER: Um,       
      5' 10", 150 pounds.       

995
00:53:15,962 --> 00:53:17,928
   911 OPERATOR: Hair color?    

996
00:53:17,930 --> 00:53:19,930
     SOCIAL WORKER: Brown.      

997
00:53:19,932 --> 00:53:22,433
     911 OPERATOR: Did you      
  notice what he was wearing?   

998
00:53:22,435 --> 00:53:24,668
  SOCIAL WORKER: No, I didn't   
  notice what he was wearing.   

999
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:25,669
  KEITH MORRISON: And finally.  

1000
00:53:25,671 --> 00:53:26,870
    911 OPERATOR: All right.    

1001
00:53:26,872 --> 00:53:28,038
      We'll have somebody       
      look for you there.       

1002
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,206
       SOCIAL WORKER: OK.       
      How long will it be?      

1003
00:53:29,208 --> 00:53:30,507
        911 OPERATOR: I         
       don't know, ma'am.       

1004
00:53:30,509 --> 00:53:31,675
    They have to respond to     
   emergency life-threatening   

1005
00:53:31,677 --> 00:53:33,243
       situations first.        

1006
00:53:33,245 --> 00:53:34,311
  The first available deputy--  

1007
00:53:34,313 --> 00:53:35,279
         SOCIAL WORKER:         
       Well, this could--       

1008
00:53:35,281 --> 00:53:36,447
this could be life-threatening. 

1009
00:53:36,449 --> 00:53:38,782
      He went to court on       
       Wednesday and he--       

1010
00:53:38,784 --> 00:53:41,285
  he didn't get his kids back.  

1011
00:53:41,287 --> 00:53:42,719
      And this is really--      

1012
00:53:42,721 --> 00:53:45,489
        I'm-- I'm afraid        
        for their lives.        

1013
00:53:45,491 --> 00:53:46,723
        KEITH MORRISON:         
     Deputies were alerted      

1014
00:53:46,725 --> 00:53:49,126
    by dispatch at 12:16 PM.    

1015
00:53:49,128 --> 00:53:52,562
       It was flagged as        
        a routine call.         

1016
00:53:52,564 --> 00:53:55,899
  And at that moment, 911 lit   
    up with multiple reports    

1017
00:53:55,901 --> 00:53:57,100
   of an explosion and fire.    

1018
00:53:57,102 --> 00:53:58,802
        [phone ringing]         

1019
00:53:58,804 --> 00:53:59,603
       911 OPERATOR: 911.       

1020
00:53:59,605 --> 00:54:00,804
    What are you reporting?     

1021
00:54:00,806 --> 00:54:02,105
      MALE CALLER: I just       
      had a house explode.      

1022
00:54:02,107 --> 00:54:03,573
        [phone ringing]         

1023
00:54:03,575 --> 00:54:05,609
 FEMALE CALLER: The house just  
   blew up and it's on fire.    

1024
00:54:05,611 --> 00:54:06,743
        [phone ringing]         

1025
00:54:06,745 --> 00:54:07,610
       911 OPERATOR: What       
       are you reporting?       

1026
00:54:07,612 --> 00:54:08,611
FEMALE CALLER: I believe, fire. 

1027
00:54:08,613 --> 00:54:10,080
      911 OPERATOR: Where?      

1028
00:54:10,082 --> 00:54:11,448
   KEITH MORRISON: The social   
 worker who delivered the boys  

1029
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:12,849
 to Josh was back on the phone. 

1030
00:54:12,851 --> 00:54:14,851
       SOCIAL WORKER: He        
      exploded the house.       

1031
00:54:14,853 --> 00:54:16,786
   911 OPERATOR: Do you know    
   if anyone's in the house?    

1032
00:54:16,788 --> 00:54:17,821
      SOCIAL WORKER: Yes.       

1033
00:54:17,823 --> 00:54:19,689
        There was a man         
       and two children.        

1034
00:54:19,691 --> 00:54:21,457
       I just dropped off       
      the children and he       

1035
00:54:21,459 --> 00:54:23,026
  wouldn't let me in the door.  

1036
00:54:23,028 --> 00:54:24,827
   KEITH MORRISON: Chuck Cox    
  heard the news from a friend  

1037
00:54:24,829 --> 00:54:26,663
  who had seen it on Facebook.  

1038
00:54:26,665 --> 00:54:30,033
   And when I got there, there  
 were police cars, fire trucks. 

1039
00:54:30,035 --> 00:54:33,069
   And I went to the line and   
   the house was smoldering.    

1040
00:54:33,071 --> 00:54:34,670
 And I still didn't believe it. 

1041
00:54:34,672 --> 00:54:35,838
        KEITH MORRISON:         
      And with the horror       

1042
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:38,040
 and disbelief came questions.  

1043
00:54:38,042 --> 00:54:39,675
 Could this have been foreseen? 

1044
00:54:39,677 --> 00:54:43,145
     Could Josh's evil plan     
   somehow had been derailed?   

1045
00:54:43,147 --> 00:54:44,914
      I feel strongly that      
    the judge did everything    

1046
00:54:44,916 --> 00:54:46,549
 possible to protect the boys.  

1047
00:54:46,551 --> 00:54:48,050
          Josh did it.          

1048
00:54:48,052 --> 00:54:50,953
 And I truly believe that when  
  someone's committed to doing  

1049
00:54:50,955 --> 00:54:53,022
    something this horrific,    
        there is nothing        

1050
00:54:53,024 --> 00:54:54,857
  anybody can do to stop them.  

1051
00:54:54,859 --> 00:54:56,192
     He was going to do it.     

1052
00:54:56,194 --> 00:54:57,593
   KEITH MORRISON: But could    
     the children have been     

1053
00:54:57,595 --> 00:54:59,762
rescued in those final moments? 

1054
00:54:59,764 --> 00:55:01,430
      Is someone to blame?      

1055
00:55:01,432 --> 00:55:03,032
      Oh, it was horrible.      

1056
00:55:03,034 --> 00:55:05,467
        I mean, this has        
       been a nightmare.        

1057
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:08,003
  KEITH MORRISON: Fingers have  
   been pointed at this man--   

1058
00:55:08,005 --> 00:55:09,905
         Dave Loverack.         

1059
00:55:09,907 --> 00:55:11,740
          He's the 911          
     dispatcher who caught      

1060
00:55:11,742 --> 00:55:12,908
   the initial call that day.   

1061
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:14,042
         DAVE LOVERACK:         
      What's the address?       

1062
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:15,310
      KEITH MORRISON: Just      
        one of thousands        

1063
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:17,513
  in his 18 years on the job.   

1064
00:55:17,515 --> 00:55:21,516
       To hear how clumsy       
    and faltering I sounded.    

1065
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:23,251
    SOCIAL WORKER: The visit    
      is with Josh Powell.      

1066
00:55:23,253 --> 00:55:24,419
       DAVE LOVERACK: And       
        who supervises?         

1067
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:25,821
       SOCIAL WORKER: And       
    he's the husband that--     

1068
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:27,823
          I supervise.          

1069
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:29,958
DAVE LOVERACK: So you supervise 
  and you're doing the visit?   

1070
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,293
      SOCIAL WORKER: Yeah.      
         I supervise--          

1071
00:55:31,295 --> 00:55:32,761
       DAVE LOVERACK: You       
      supervise yourself?       

1072
00:55:32,763 --> 00:55:34,196
        SOCIAL WORKER: I        
       supervise myself.        

1073
00:55:34,198 --> 00:55:36,064
    I'm the supervisor here.    

1074
00:55:36,066 --> 00:55:37,566
 DAVE LOVERACK: Wait a minute.  

1075
00:55:37,568 --> 00:55:40,135
  If it's a supervised visit,   
 you can't supervise yourself.  

1076
00:55:40,137 --> 00:55:42,337
   It's almost painful because  
you know what's going to happen 

1077
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:43,838
  when you're listening to it.  

1078
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,507
  But at the time, you didn't   
 know what was going to happen. 

1079
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:46,841
  DAVE LOVERACK: That's right.  

1080
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,043
     But as you listen to it    
  now, what does it do to you?  

1081
00:55:48,045 --> 00:55:50,612
     Oh, it's excruciating.     

1082
00:55:50,614 --> 00:55:52,113
   It's painful to listen to.   

1083
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:54,015
       DAVE LOVERACK: And       
      the dad's last name?      

1084
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,083
     SOCIAL WORKER: Powell.     

1085
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:58,019
         I was aware of         
      Josh Powell's story,      

1086
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,754
but I didn't associate his name.

1087
00:55:59,756 --> 00:56:02,257
      And so, his name was      
    not resonating with me.     

1088
00:56:02,259 --> 00:56:04,292
     DAVE LOVERACK: Two Ls      
     at the end of Powell?      

1089
00:56:04,294 --> 00:56:05,226
      SOCIAL WORKER: Yes.       

1090
00:56:05,228 --> 00:56:06,794
         Realizing what         
        we all know now,        

1091
00:56:06,796 --> 00:56:09,897
  I wish I had recognized the   
   urgency of the situation.    

1092
00:56:09,899 --> 00:56:12,033
         You're all in a        
      position which was,       

1093
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:13,468
  nobody could have imagined.   

1094
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:14,836
             Right.             

1095
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:17,738
Because you don't automatically 
     default to the notion      

1096
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:20,508
     that the person you're     
 dealing with is a psychopath.  

1097
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:23,978
  It's difficult when one goes  
south on you like this one did. 

1098
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:27,615
      The Coxes don't blame     
   Dave Loverack, not at all.   

1099
00:56:27,617 --> 00:56:29,917
       And they've worked       
       hard to stay calm,       

1100
00:56:29,919 --> 00:56:32,453
      even after the loss       
      of their grandsons,       

1101
00:56:32,455 --> 00:56:36,290
  along with Josh and whatever  
 he may have known about Susan. 

1102
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:39,660
       I think he was very      
      selfish, and that's       

1103
00:56:39,662 --> 00:56:40,761
     why he took the kids.      

1104
00:56:40,763 --> 00:56:42,229
             [sighs]            

1105
00:56:42,231 --> 00:56:44,531
    If he couldn't have them,   
    no one could have them.     

1106
00:56:44,533 --> 00:56:46,300
          I would have          
      appreciated it if he      

1107
00:56:46,302 --> 00:56:51,105
   had left a note telling us   
 where Susan was or something,  

1108
00:56:51,107 --> 00:56:52,306
           you know.            

1109
00:56:52,308 --> 00:56:54,741
       Maybe the point was      
      not to tell anyone.       

1110
00:56:54,743 --> 00:56:55,542
              Yeah.             

1111
00:56:55,544 --> 00:56:56,877
              Yeah.             

1112
00:56:56,879 --> 00:57:01,048
     Oh, I'm sure he wants      
   for us to never find her.    

1113
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:03,250
         He's still mad         
        at us, you know.        

1114
00:57:03,252 --> 00:57:06,486
    And mad at us because we    
 won't give up on our daughter, 

1115
00:57:06,488 --> 00:57:07,954
     finding our daughter.      

1116
00:57:07,956 --> 00:57:10,090
 KEITH MORRISON: Investigators  
   have not given up either.    

1117
00:57:10,092 --> 00:57:13,326
   They searched that storage   
  unit of Josh's and recovered  

1118
00:57:13,328 --> 00:57:15,996
       a comforter among        
      Susan's belongings.       

1119
00:57:15,998 --> 00:57:19,966
  Preliminary tests indicated   
      blood stains on it.       

1120
00:57:19,968 --> 00:57:23,069
     And Chuck Cox believes     
   there is still one person    

1121
00:57:23,071 --> 00:57:25,472
 who can answer his questions.  

1122
00:57:25,474 --> 00:57:27,107
    His dad knows something.    

1123
00:57:27,109 --> 00:57:30,810
 His dad had some part in this. 

1124
00:57:30,812 --> 00:57:32,212
     KEITH MORRISON: Police     
       have named Steven        

1125
00:57:32,214 --> 00:57:34,180
  Powell a person of interest.  

1126
00:57:34,182 --> 00:57:36,182
     Though he was far away     
    when Susan disappeared,     

1127
00:57:36,184 --> 00:57:37,450
      they have questions.      

1128
00:57:37,452 --> 00:57:39,285
Did he goad Josh into something?

1129
00:57:39,287 --> 00:57:41,187
        Did he devise or        
       assist a cover up?       

1130
00:57:41,189 --> 00:57:44,457
 Did his words help cause this? 

1131
00:57:44,459 --> 00:57:48,694
    A police source say they    
  grilled Steven relentlessly.  

1132
00:57:48,696 --> 00:57:51,564
   His response was silence.    

1133
00:57:51,566 --> 00:57:53,666
       And the parents of       
       a sunny girl will        

1134
00:57:53,668 --> 00:57:55,968
 never stop searching for her.  

1135
00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:57,837
    Will never stop hurting.    

1136
00:57:57,839 --> 00:57:59,472
           And yet--            

1137
00:57:59,474 --> 00:58:02,475
     We could be mad at Josh    
 and we could be mad at Steve.  

1138
00:58:02,477 --> 00:58:05,144
 It's not anger, it's sadness.  

1139
00:58:05,146 --> 00:58:06,645
       But there's hope.        

1140
00:58:06,647 --> 00:58:09,815
We believe that they're safe in 
 another life with the Heavenly 

1141
00:58:09,817 --> 00:58:11,317
Father who knows what happened. 

1142
00:58:11,319 --> 00:58:14,520
   And it will all be better,   
     so we have that hope.      

1143
00:58:17,325 --> 00:58:20,225
         In 2012, Steven        
      Powell was convicted      

1144
00:58:20,227 --> 00:58:24,763
 on 14 counts of voyeurism and  
 sentenced to 2 and 1/2 years.  

1145
00:58:24,765 --> 00:58:28,534
 He returned to prison in 2016  
  for a five-year sentence on   

1146
00:58:28,536 --> 00:58:30,569
a child pornography conviction. 

1147
00:58:30,571 --> 00:58:32,237
  He has since been released.   

1148
00:58:32,239 --> 00:58:34,439
      Meanwhile, after an       
     investigation spanning     

1149
00:58:34,441 --> 00:58:38,076
   more than three years and    
   11 states, police in Utah    

1150
00:58:38,078 --> 00:58:41,213
       have halted their        
    search for Susan Powell.    

1151
00:58:41,215 --> 00:58:43,015
      That's all for this       
     edition of "Dateline."     

1152
