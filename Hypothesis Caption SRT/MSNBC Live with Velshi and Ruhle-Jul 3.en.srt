That's why there's Otezla.      

613
00:24:55,545 --> 00:24:57,178
Otezla is not a cream.          

614
00:24:57,213 --> 00:25:00,014
It's a pill that treats plaque  
psoriasis differently.          

615
00:25:00,049 --> 00:25:04,018
With Otezla, 75% clearer        
skin is achievable.

allergic to Otezla.             

617
00:25:06,055 --> 00:25:08,856
It may cause severe             
diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting.  

618
00:25:08,891 --> 00:25:12,026
Otezla is associated with an    
increased risk of depression.   

619
00:25:12,061 --> 00:25:14,028
Tell your doctor if you have a  
history of depression           

620
00:25:14,063 --> 00:25:16,697
or suicidal thoughts            
or if these feelings develop.

00:25:16,732 --> 00:25:19,033
Some people taking Otezla       
reported weight loss.           

622
00:25:19,068 --> 00:25:21,702
Your doctor should monitor your 
weight and may stop treatment.

631
