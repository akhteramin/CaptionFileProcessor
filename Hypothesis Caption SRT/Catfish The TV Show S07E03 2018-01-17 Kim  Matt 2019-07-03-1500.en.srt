- All right.                    

22
00:01:23,434 --> 00:01:24,867
So yesterday,                   
we did some research.           

23
00:01:24,936 --> 00:01:26,168
- We don't know what            
to make of this.                

24
00:01:26,237 --> 00:01:28,337
   - We're a little befuddled.  

25
00:01:28,406 --> 00:01:30,840
         Okay, so here's        
        where we started.       

26
00:01:30,942 --> 00:01:32,908
   So the first thing we found  
 when we searched his number... 

27
00:01:32,977 --> 00:01:34,443
             Bingo.             
       - Look what we got.      

28
00:01:34,512 --> 00:01:35,778
     Number for five years.     

29
00:01:35,847 --> 00:01:37,580
  Comes back to a Matt [bleep]. 

30
00:01:37,648 --> 00:01:39,148
      - This never happens.     

31
00:01:39,217 --> 00:01:40,750
     It's in Florida, which     
   is where he says he lives,   

32
00:01:40,818 --> 00:01:44,153
       so this was kind of      
        a good surprise,        

33
00:01:44,222 --> 00:01:46,022
   and he also has a Twitter.   

34
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,357
   Then there's some pictures   
         back from 2012         

35
00:01:48,426 --> 00:01:50,693
 that look like they're of him. 

36
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:52,795
  This would have been the Matt 

37
00:01:52,864 --> 00:01:56,032
        that you sort of        
       started talking to.      

38
00:01:57,302 --> 00:02:01,871

        It could be him.        

43
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,301
