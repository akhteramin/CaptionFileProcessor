      would keep us apart.      

1653
00:59:25,095 --> 00:59:27,229
    So I talked to my doctor    
         about HUMIRA.          

1654
00:59:27,264 --> 00:59:28,630
 I learned HUMIRA can help get,

   and keep UC under control    

1656

 when other medications haven't 
      worked well enough.       

1657
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:34,903
  And it helps people achieve   
      control that lasts.       

1658
00:59:34,939 --> 00:59:36,138
   So you can experience few

        or no symptoms.

00:59:37,341 --> 00:59:39,474
 <i> HUMIRA can lower your ability</i>
