113
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:36,601
        - Well, that's...       

114

   I know that. Something big.  

117

118
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,643

        it's the biggest,       

119
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:46,378

      is by opening those.      

120
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,747
      What's ever in those      
        is not in yours.        

121
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,283
 We're gonna start by opening up
        six cases, Tony.        

122
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:55,554
   - Okay. Howie, did you ever  
       play bingo before?       

123
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:56,555
          - Many times.         

124
00:05:56,657 --> 00:05:57,823
          - Many times?         
             - Yes.             

125
00:05:57,925 --> 00:06:00,392
 - I'm no good at it, but I'm...
           [laughing]           

126
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:02,327
      Our first number up--     
          if everybody          

127
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:04,996
     has their cards ready,     
              um...             

128
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:07,099
        We have number 5.       

129
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:11,503
       - Number 5 is Lani.      
         Open your case.        

130
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:13,805
   Small amount. That's okay.   

131
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:14,806
       - Yes! That's okay.      
         - That's good.         

132
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:15,807
         - That's good.         
         - That's good.         

133
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:16,975
         - That's good.         

134
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:18,477
 - That's good. Five more cases.
             - Yes.             

135
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:21,947
 We're going no higher than that
    the rest of these picks.    

136
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:25,183
   Here we go. The next number  
      we've picked was 17.      

137
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:29,187
      - 17. That's Ashley.      
         Open your case.        

138
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:31,223
        - Low, low, low,        
       low, low, low, low.      

139
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:33,191
        Yeah! [laughing]        

140
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:40,232
              Whoo!             
          - Four more.          

141
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:44,369
    This is my favorite game.   

142
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:49,107
           - Number 9.          
       - That's Patricia.       

143
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,677
         Open your case.        
       - Small, Patricia.       

144
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,745
          Small, small.         

145
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:57,949
   - That's okay. That's okay.  

146
00:06:58,051 --> 00:07:02,921
 It really is, because you still
       have six of the top      

147
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:06,958
  seven amounts still in play,  
      including $1 million.     

148
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,562
             - Yes!             
          - Three more.         

149
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:14,366
       - We have number 3.      

150
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:18,937
   - 3. Katie. Open the case.   

151
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:21,473
             - Yes!             

152
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:27,646
          - Oh, my God.         

153
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:29,781
  People who are just tuning in 
   are going, "What is this?"   

154
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:34,219
      - "What is going on?"     
         Number 1. Yes!         

155
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:36,555
    - Soraya. Open your case.   

156
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:39,858
             - Yeah!            

157
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:49,968
           Number 15.           
 - How about that? That's Madi. 

158
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,903
           - Hi, Madi.          

159
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,239
        - Open your case.       

160
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:55,774
         - Small. Small.        

161
00:07:58,712 --> 00:07:59,744
               Ah!              

162
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:07,519
 - That was a good first round. 

163
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:10,455
    Six out of the seven top    
   amounts are still in play.   

164
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:11,756
             - Whoo!            
          - And I want          

165
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:13,592
     to tell you something.     
     You know, you sense it.    

166
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:15,360
   When somebody comes up here  
      and you talk to them,     

167
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:17,929
 you can sense what kind of vibe
       they're giving out.      

168
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:19,865
    This audience loves you.    

169
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,434
    I would imagine, at home,   
     people are just going,     

170
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:25,170
    "Wow. This guy's amazing.   
   We want him to win money."   

171
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:28,473
 There's only one person--I will
  tell you--there is one person 

172
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:30,008
       that it's not about      
          winning over,         

173
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,610
      and that is that lady     
          right there.          

174
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:34,846
  That lady wants you to leave  
   with as little as possible.  

175
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:37,582
   She wants to buy that case   
       from you right now       

176
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,384
   for as little as possible.   

177
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:41,720
         [phone ringing]        

178
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:43,622
       She's about to make      
        your first offer.       

179
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,058
             Hello?             

180
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:51,129
 She said she's having a little 
 trouble reading you, you know? 

181
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:52,697
    She said she can't tell.    

182
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,333
       She wants to know,       
   are you having a good time?  

183
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:58,270
          - [laughing]          

184
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:00,539
     Guys, are we all having    
        a good time? Yes!       

185
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:11,116
       - Good first round.      
       Great first offer:       

186
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:13,919
            $30,000.            

187
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:19,024
           Now, Tony,           
   it's "Deal or No Deal" 2.0.  

188
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:20,525
      There is one option.      

189
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:23,194
        Once in the game,       
     you can counter-offer.     

190
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:26,865
       If she accepts it,       
   she'll give you the money,   

191
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:29,267
     you give her the case,     
        and you go home.        

192
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:32,404
     If she says "no deal,"     
        you must play on.       

193
00:09:32,506 --> 00:09:35,140
       Five cases to open.      
           So Tony...           

194
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:38,877
             - Yes.             
   - Oriente, deal or no deal?  

195
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:40,845
          all: No deal!         

196
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:45,350
  - Howie, $30,000 would get us 
       to our dream home,       

197
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:48,219
    which is our Golden Girls   
        house in Florida        

198
00:09:48,322 --> 00:09:49,955
  that we really, really want.  

199
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:53,592
       But we'd also like       
     to add the lanai to it.    

200
00:09:57,097 --> 00:10:01,299
     So for the first time,     
     I have to say: no deal.    

201
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:04,769
      - Close the box. Wow.

00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:08,006

203
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,375

      - That's the wedding!     

350
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:20,164

354
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:28,539
  - Okay, so we just celebrated 
     our fourth anniversary.    

355
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:31,542
        I always believed       
       we are one person,       

356
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:33,144
   and then we were separated,  

357
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:36,714
 and we've spent our whole lives
 looking for our heart and soul,

358
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:38,082
         and that's him.        

359
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:39,817
             - Aww.             
          - Wonderful.          

360
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:42,987
             Hello.             

361
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:44,422
          - Hi, Howie.          
         - Who are you?         

362
00:18:44,524 --> 00:18:47,592
   - I'm Rosemary, and I just   
     wanted to let you know     

363
00:18:47,694 --> 00:18:51,362
         from the get-go        
     that we are all criers.    

364
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,233
             And...             
         - So I've seen.        

365
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:59,770
  - To prepare for today, Tony  
  gave us each our own hankie.  

366
00:18:59,873 --> 00:19:03,207
     Our hearts are in this     
  no matter what happens today. 

367
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:04,876
             - Okay.            
    - Our hearts are in this.   

368
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:06,277
          - Wonderful.          
      You're here for Tony.     

369
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:09,514
        And who are you?        
    - Hi. My name is Nicole.    

370
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:13,951
  Tony has been my inspiration, 
         my best buddy.         

371
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:16,888
         He is so giving        
        and so selfless,        

372
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:20,791
   and I'm here to support you  
     as you win $1 million!     

373
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:24,762
          - All right.          
    So come over here, Tony.    

374
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:26,097
             - Yeah.            
             - Okay.            

375
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:27,698
        - Come over here.       
   So you could talk to them.   

376
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,068
  There's $52,000, guaranteed.  

377
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:33,538
             - Okay.            
      - There is an option      

378
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,406
       of a counteroffer,       

379
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,542
        which you can do,       
 or you could just say "no deal"

380
00:19:37,644 --> 00:19:39,110
      and go on and open up     
        four more cases,        

381
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:41,145
      so I'm gonna ask you,     
         Tony Oriente...        

382
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:43,514
             - Yes.             
       - Deal or no deal?       

383
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:45,349
          all: No deal!         

384
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:48,586
      - So I'm the Sophia of    
        the household--         

385
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,455

     I have to ask Dorothy.     

386
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:55,026
       - Well, Ma, I think      

387
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:58,729
 you should--I think you should 
   continue to play this game.  

388
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:01,599
         I say no deal.         

389
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:08,072
  - By popular demand, no deal. 

390
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:09,440
           - No deal.           

391
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:18,249
 You just said "no" to $52,000. 
    What does that feel like?   

392
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:20,384
 - That's more than I would make
           in a year.           

393
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,521
   That would help us so--that  
   would help us tremendously,  

394
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:25,623
       and I can't believe      
      I just put that back.     

395
