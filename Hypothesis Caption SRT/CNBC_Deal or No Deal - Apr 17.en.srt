00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,395
       was there a reason       
         you chose four?

     until the party starts.

  And the way the party starts  

115
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:42,714

          those cases.

00:08:56,904 --> 00:08:58,803
   That's what it's all about   
         for you, right?        

230
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:01,907
   - Well, my very best friend  
    and my parents are there.   

231
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:04,476
    Um...I was actually sick    
         through my 20s,        

232
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:08,246
    and I watched my parents    
      go to work every day      

233
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:10,282
          just to cover         
     the insurance premiums     

234
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:12,918
     for me to get treatment    
     to sleep on their couch    

235
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,587
         18 hours a day.        
     It took about six years    

236
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:17,188
      for me to get better.     

237
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,723
     I never thought I'd get    
     married, go to school,     

238
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:20,058
          have a baby,          

239
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,094
         and...look now!        

240
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:25,163
      [cheers and applause]     
     - Wow. That's amazing.     

241
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:27,399
 - I want a portion of whatever 
   I get to go to my parents.   

242
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:29,167
            - Right.            
    Oh, that's so wonderful.    

243
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:30,569
             - Yes.             
         - To give back.        

244
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:33,738
           [applause]           
     - So...fingers crossed!    

245
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,508
     - All right, five more     
         cases to open.         

246
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,411
        - Okay. How 'bout       
       lucky number seven?      

247
00:09:39,513 --> 00:09:41,446
         - Small amount.        
         Open the case.         

248
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:43,281
       - [mouthing words]       

249
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:46,251
         - That's okay.         
         - That's okay.         

250
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:47,686
       - That's less than       
      the big ones before.      

251
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:51,222
  - It's less than my million.  
   - You got four more cases.   

252
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:52,791
          - Number 14.          

253
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:54,593
      - Olga, small amount!     

254
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:56,227
          - The $1.00.          

255
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,596
              1.00!             
            - $1.00.            

256
00:09:57,698 --> 00:09:59,831
          <i> [bass notes]</i>         
        [audience groans]       

257
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,701
       That's a tough one       
        - Oh, that hurt.        

258
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:08,306
 - There's still a great safety 
   net of 200,000 to $400,000.  

259
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:09,941
  All right, three more cases.  

260
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:11,743
     - All right, number 26.    

261
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:14,479
   - Michelle, open your case.  

262
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:17,115
      - $1.00. You've gotta     
     have the dollar in it.     

263
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:18,283
             Please!            

264
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:22,621
               Oh!              

265
00:10:24,992 --> 00:10:26,791
          Sassy! Sassy.         
         - She is sassy.        

266
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:29,327
         Sassy Michelle.        
         Two more cases.        

267
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:32,497
      - Let's get sometimes     
    unlucky 13 off the board.   

268
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:35,300
     - That is Mahogany Lox.    
        - Come on, girl!        

269
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:37,469
        - Open your case!       

270
00:10:37,571 --> 00:10:39,204
        - Little, sister!       

271
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,106
             - Ooh.             
             - Eek!             

272
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,707
         It's all right.        
         It's all right.        

273
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,175
          - All right.          
       The million dollars      

274
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:45,877
        is still in play.       

275
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,779
      Okay? One more case.      
          - All right.          

276
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:48,880
      We'll go number one.      

277
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,416
    - Soraya, open your case.   

278
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:55,620
             - Yes!             

279
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:58,790
      [cheers and applause]     
          - All right.          

280
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:01,292
       Here is the offer.       

281
00:11:01,395 --> 00:11:03,895
             Hello?             
  - I'm ready for the weather!  

282
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,164
           [laughter]           

283
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:08,600
             - Okay.            

284
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:10,735
       You think the offer      
        went up or down?        

285
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:13,238
        You did knock out       
   a couple of big ones there.  

286
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,540
   - I do believe it went up.   
             - Why?             

287
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:18,109
  - Because I want it to be up! 

288
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:20,945
       [laughter, cheers]       

289
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:23,214
        - You are right,        
        and it's because        

290
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:27,385
       the million dollars      
  is still in play--that's why. 

291
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:30,955
   And it went up to $26,000.   

292
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:33,591
       The million dollars      
        is still in play.       

293
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:35,860
    I told you, you got a big   
  decision here, and it's real. 

294
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:38,863
   And you have an opportunity  
  to counter-offer if you want. 

295
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:40,699
        You don't have to       
         do this alone.         

296
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:42,167
  You brought some supporters.  
             - Yes!             

297
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:43,268
          - All right.          

298
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:47,539
               Hi!              
              - Hi.             

299
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:49,741
       - What's your name?      
       - My name is Acton.      

300
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:51,176
    I'm a fellow Marine wife.   
        - Oh, wonderful.        

301
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:53,078
 - We met through our husbands. 

302
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,180
  We've done every crazy thing  

303
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:57,382
  in life that the Marine Corps 
           can handle.          

304
00:11:57,484 --> 00:11:59,384
   We've been there together,   
       all through it all.      

305
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:01,519
          - Whoo! Yeah!         
             - Okay.            

306
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:03,922
          And you are?          
     - My name is Kristika.     

307
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:06,024
         I met Courtney         
        in the last year.       

308
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:07,659
       She is a great mom.      

309
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:10,161
   Like with Payton, she turns  
   everything into a positive.  

310
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:12,230
        It could be bad,        
   but she'll turn it around.   

311
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:14,199
         She is awesome.        
  - And who are you, young man? 

312
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:16,401
        - How you doing?        
       - I'm doing great.       

313
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:19,237
           - I'm John.          
 I married the love of my life. 

314
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,439
             - Yeah!            

315
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,742
         - First of all,        
   thank you for your service.  

316
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:25,410
         - Thank you for        
       the support, Howie.      

317
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:27,078
        She supported me        
     through thick and thin,    

318
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,047
    eight years of marriage,    
      multiple deployments.     

319
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:30,715
       And we're all here       
         to support you.        

320
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:33,184
  We're all here for your day.  
             - Yeah!            

321
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:34,853
          - I love you.         

322
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:37,222
 - She's dreamed about this day 
        for a long time.        

323
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:38,757
       Happy Courtney Day!      
             - Whoo!            

324
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:40,992
      - Happy Courtney Day!     
      - Happy Courtney Day!     

325
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:44,395
      - Happy Courtney Day!     

326
00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:46,531
   You got emotional when they  
     were talking about you.    

327
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:48,032
             - Yeah.            

328
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:52,036
   My husband has been in the   
 Marine Corps for 20 years now. 

329
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:53,605
      [cheers and applause]     

330
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:55,140
  And I couldn't be more proud. 

331
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:57,709
  I know I talk about Michigan, 

332
00:12:57,811 --> 00:12:59,577
     but he and my daughter     
          are my home,          

333
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,713
       and we're gonna go       
        wherever he does.       

334
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:04,149
    And we just hope to land    
          in Michigan.          

335
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:06,785
    - You support going back    
        to Michigan, sir?       

336
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:08,386
    - I do support going home   
           to Michigan          

337
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:11,122
        when I do retire,       
        whenever that is.       

338
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:13,691
 And this million dollars that's
    in that number four case    

339
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:15,794
        is gonna help us.       
             - Yeah!            

340
00:13:15,896 --> 00:13:17,796
 - All right, Courtney Schlaud,
