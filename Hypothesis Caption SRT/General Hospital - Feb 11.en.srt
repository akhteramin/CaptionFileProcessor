    before they even start.

      BOTOX® is for adults

 hours to weeks after injection 

686

   causing serious symptoms.

 Alert your doctor right away,  
   as difficulty swallowing,

        Side effects may

   there's a skin infection.    

694

  including botulinum toxins,   

697
00:32:17,218 --> 00:32:19,752

1200
00:53:48,307 --> 00:53:50,674
            So, if I can        
    just sum it all up by saying

1201
00:53:50,776 --> 00:53:55,712
           that my father was...
        distant, unapproachable,

1202
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:59,616
        and a controlling figure

1203
00:53:59,718 --> 00:54:03,987
          He was, um...ruthless,

1204
00:54:04,089 --> 00:54:07,591
