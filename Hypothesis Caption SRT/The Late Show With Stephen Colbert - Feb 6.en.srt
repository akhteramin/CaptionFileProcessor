        Psst. Hey, you!         

1571
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:23,144
 The one with the designer dog  
 collar.                        

1572
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:25,947
Wondering how I upgraded to this
sweet pad?                      

1573
01:01:25,982 --> 01:01:29,868
 A 1,200-square-foot bathroom,  
 and my very own spa.           

1574
01:01:29,903 --> 01:01:33,071
  All I had to do was give my   
  human “the look”.             

1575
01:01:33,123 --> 01:01:35,990
  With Wells Fargo's 3% down    
  payment on a fixed-rate loan  

1576
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:37,792
      and a simpler online      
      application,              

1577
01:01:37,827 --> 01:01:40,695
 getting into my dream home was 
 easier than ever.              

1578
01:01:40,714 --> 01:01:44,382
    Get your human to visit

01:01:44,417 --> 01:01:46,417
 What would she do without me?
