   You didn't choose to have    
   endometriosis...             

806
00:34:23,028 --> 00:34:24,027
   but you can choose to ask    

807
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,762
 if ORILISSA is right for you.  

808
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:27,697
    ORILISSA is specifically    
    developed for women         

809
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:30,333
    with moderate to severe     
    endometriosis pain.         

810
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:31,368
      In clinical trials,       

811
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:33,837
ORILISSA was proven to reduce 3 
common types of                 

812
00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:35,105
      endometriosis pain,       

813
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,006
        painful periods,        

814
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:37,407
     pelvic pain in between     
     periods,                   

815
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:38,908
       and pain with sex.       

816
00:34:38,944 --> 00:34:41,077
Don't use ORILISSA if you are or
may be pregnant,                

817
00:34:41,113 --> 00:34:42,145

  taking drugs like             

819
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:46,549
  cyclosporine or gemfibrozil.  

820
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:48,451
     It may cause abnormal      
     liver tests.               

821
00:34:48,487 --> 00:34:50,720
    ORILISSA may change your    
    periods, making it hard     

822
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:52,289
  to know if you are pregnant.  

823
00:34:52,324 --> 00:34:53,723
 It does not prevent pregnancy. 

824
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:56,293
Use birth control that does not 
contain hormones.               

825
00:34:56,328 --> 00:34:58,895
  ORILISSA may cause suicidal   
  thoughts or actions.          

826
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,765
  It may also cause bone loss.  

827
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,701
   Ask your gynecologist if     
   ORILISSA is right for you.

1010
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:00,850
 (Announcer)                    
 Do you push through migraine?  

1011
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:03,119
    (Daughter)                  
    Mom, are you OK to play?    

1012
00:42:03,421 --> 00:42:05,688
(Mom)                           
Yeah honey, how about we play...

     princess and pirates?      

1014
00:42:08,226 --> 00:42:11,127
  (Announcer)                   
  Imagine what you can do with  
  more migraine-free days.      

1015
00:42:15,967 --> 00:42:17,133
            (Pirate)            
            Arr!                

1016
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:18,901
           (Mom)                
           En garde!            

1017
00:42:20,472 --> 00:42:22,038
    (Announcer)                 
    When you're not fighting    
    through migraine            

1018
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,973
   imagine the possibilities.   

1019
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:27,043
 Once-monthly Emgality is used  
 for the prevention             

1020
00:42:27,145 --> 00:42:28,311
     of migraine in adults.     

1021
00:42:28,413 --> 00:42:30,446
 It's specifically developed to 
 help give you                  

1022
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,081
    more migraine-free days.    

1023
00:42:32,317 --> 00:42:35,551
 With Emgality about 60% of     
 people had their migraine days 

1024
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:36,819
      cut in half or more.      

1025
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:39,755
Do not use if you are allergic  
to Emgality or its ingredients. 

1026
00:42:40,992 --> 00:42:43,025
  Emgality may cause allergic   
  reactions, such as            

1027
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:45,127
    itching, rash, hives and    
    trouble breathing,          

1028
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,662
which can happen days after use.

1029
00:42:46,965 --> 00:42:48,698
Call your doctor or get medical 
help right away                 

1030
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,666
   if you have symptoms of an   
   allergic reaction.           

1031
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:52,034
      The most common side      
      effects include           

1032
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:53,469
   injection site reactions.    

1033
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:54,737
  (Mom)                         
  What should we do tomorrow?   

1034
00:42:55,006 --> 00:42:56,606
(Announcer)                     
Ask your doctor about Emgality.

Elaine Barber,                  

1048
00:44:30,735 --> 00:44:32,902
and I'm a                       
five-year cancer survivor.      

1049
00:44:32,904 --> 00:44:36,305
    Surviving for five years    
         is a big deal.         

1050
00:44:36,307 --> 00:44:39,358
  I had so many people at CTCA  

1051
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:42,578
  helping me find a way to go   
    through the treatments.     

1052
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:45,581
    The reality of cancer is    
    not everybody survives.     

1053
00:44:45,583 --> 00:44:47,366
            At CTCA,            

1054
00:44:47,368 --> 00:44:49,818
        they have a huge        
     celebrate life event.      

1055
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,621
        That was amazing        
     because the whole day      

1056
00:44:51,623 --> 00:44:53,456
was about all of the survivors. 

1057
00:44:53,458 --> 00:44:55,207
  I'm excited about my future.

00:49:11,965 --> 00:49:13,799
     I've always been amazed    
         by what's next.        

1177
00:49:14,085 --> 00:49:15,501
  And still going for my best,  

1178
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:17,052
     even though I live with    
     a higher risk of stroke    

1179
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:20,139
    due to Afib not caused by   
     a heart valve problem.     

1180
00:49:20,508 --> 00:49:22,291
So if there's a better treatment
        than warfarin...        

1181
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:23,642
        I want that too.

1183
00:49:25,096 --> 00:49:26,061
        ELIQUIS is proven       

1184
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:28,297
      to reduce stroke risk     
      better than warfarin.

00:49:31,936 --> 00:49:34,486
     ELIQUIS is FDA-approved    
          and has both.

<i>unless your doctor tells you to,</i>

1191
00:49:39,944 --> 00:49:42,027
<i>as stopping increases your risk</i> 
      <i> of having a stroke.</i>      

1192

     <i> While taking ELIQUIS,</i>     
   <i> you may bruise more easily</i>

  <i> and it may take longer than</i>
