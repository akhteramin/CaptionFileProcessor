00:03:45,376 --> 00:03:47,309
back from the security deposit. 
You say the management company  
notified you of the ceiling leak

95
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:49,144
You say the management company  
notified you of the ceiling leak
and you did some investigation, 

96
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:51,079
notified you of the ceiling leak
and you did some investigation, 
and after that you realized that

97
00:03:51,081 --> 00:03:52,914
and you did some investigation, 
and after that you realized that
they caused the problem causing 

98
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,516
and after that you realized that
they caused the problem causing 
the water to leak into the      

99
00:03:54,518 --> 00:03:56,385
they caused the problem causing 
the water to leak into the      
downstairs dining room, and all 

100
00:03:56,387 --> 00:03:58,320
the water to leak into the      
downstairs dining room, and all 
of this cost you $5,000 over and

101
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:00,122
downstairs dining room, and all 
of this cost you $5,000 over and
above the $7,050 that you kept  

102
00:04:00,124 --> 00:04:00,889
of this cost you $5,000 over and
above the $7,050 that you kept  
from them.                      

103
00:04:00,891 --> 00:04:02,557
above the $7,050 that you kept  
from them.                      
And so you have a counterclaim  

104
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:04,292
from them.                      
And so you have a counterclaim  
for that money, 'cause you also 

105
00:04:04,294 --> 00:04:05,894
And so you have a counterclaim  
for that money, 'cause you also 
needed to repair the damaged    

106
00:04:05,896 --> 00:04:07,429
for that money, 'cause you also 
needed to repair the damaged    
property and remove some of     

107
00:04:07,431 --> 00:04:08,397
needed to repair the damaged    
property and remove some of     
their property.

118
00:04:20,644 --> 00:04:22,110
them that they caused the       
damage?                         
Why wouldn't you have notified

them immediately?

00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,813
Why wouldn't you have notified  
them immediately?               
>> Because that's when the money

121

still have to put them on notice
that there was something that   
they did.                       

126
00:04:29,987 --> 00:04:31,586

it's for -- the money comes out 
of that, and it's very clear    
from the reports from the       

132
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:40,729

I believe that you all should   
know, so, Kareema and I were    

423
00:12:49,385 --> 00:12:50,551
I believe that you all should   
know, so, Kareema and I were    
previous tenants as well.       

424
00:12:50,553 --> 00:12:52,086
know, so, Kareema and I were    
previous tenants as well.       
And I understand that we should 

425
00:12:52,088 --> 00:12:53,521
previous tenants as well.       
And I understand that we should 
obviously give this context.    

426
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:55,189
And I understand that we should 
obviously give this context.    
So, essentially, Kareema and I  

427
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,724
obviously give this context.    
So, essentially, Kareema and I  
first moved in in August of     

428
00:12:56,726 --> 00:12:58,426
So, essentially, Kareema and I  
first moved in in August of     
2016 with five other roommates. 

429
00:12:58,428 --> 00:12:59,827
first moved in in August of     
2016 with five other roommates. 
They all graduated, and I will  

430
00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:01,295
2016 with five other roommates. 
They all graduated, and I will  
note that we signed an original 

431
00:13:01,297 --> 00:13:02,396
They all graduated, and I will  
note that we signed an original 
lease with a different          

432
00:13:02,398 --> 00:13:03,631
note that we signed an original 
lease with a different          
management company, LAPMG.      

433
00:13:03,633 --> 00:13:04,632
lease with a different          
management company, LAPMG.      
About three months in, we were  

434
00:13:04,634 --> 00:13:05,666
management company, LAPMG.      
About three months in, we were  
notified that there was a change

435
00:13:05,668 --> 00:13:07,368
About three months in, we were  
notified that there was a change
of management to Southland for  

436
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,003
notified that there was a change
of management to Southland for  
the duration of that one-year   

437
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:09,537
of management to Southland for  
the duration of that one-year   
lease.                          

438
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:10,838
the duration of that one-year   
lease.                          
Basically, there was the leak.  

439
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,206
lease.                          
Basically, there was the leak.  
The leak occurred while we were 

440
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:12,607
Basically, there was the leak.  
The leak occurred while we were 
there.                          

441
00:13:12,609 --> 00:13:13,407
The leak occurred while we were 
there.                          
I had called our property       

442
00:13:13,409 --> 00:13:13,774
there.                          
I had called our property       
manager.                        

443
00:13:13,776 --> 00:13:14,709
I had called our property       
manager.                        
I said, "Look, there's a leak.  

444
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:15,509
manager.                        
I said, "Look, there's a leak.  
I don't know what to do."       

445
00:13:15,511 --> 00:13:16,477
I said, "Look, there's a leak.  
I don't know what to do."       
That's the reason I don't have  

446
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:17,378
I don't know what to do."       
That's the reason I don't have  
e-mail documentation of this.   

447
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:17,912
That's the reason I don't have  
e-mail documentation of this.   
They came over.                 

448
00:13:17,914 --> 00:13:18,512
e-mail documentation of this.   
They came over.                 
They looked at it.              

449
00:13:18,514 --> 00:13:19,413
They came over.                 
They looked at it.              
They said, "Okay, we're gonna   

450
00:13:19,415 --> 00:13:20,081
They looked at it.              
They said, "Okay, we're gonna   
call out a plumber."            

451
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:20,881
They said, "Okay, we're gonna   
call out a plumber."            
That is why the August 3rd      

452
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:21,248
call out a plumber."            
That is why the August 3rd      
happened.                       

453
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,216
