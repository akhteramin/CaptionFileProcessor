21

22
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:07,833

             Hello?

00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:56,648

00:01:58,018 --> 00:01:59,151

47
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:01,253

00:02:03,324 --> 00:02:04,723

          Oh, my gosh.

00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:21,240

56
00:02:21,342 --> 00:02:23,375
        Okay. All right.        

57
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:28,113
 Okay, there's eight cases left 
   that have not been opened.   

58
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:29,615
 Two of them have huge amounts, 

59
00:02:29,717 --> 00:02:32,851
      which means you have      
          a 25% chance          

60
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:36,755
     of walking out of here     
     with at least $300,000.

66
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:52,104
    She knows the board, and    
  that's why this next offer--  

67
00:02:52,206 --> 00:02:53,205
            - Uh-huh.           

68
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:55,274

        - In good shape.        

69
00:02:55,376 --> 00:02:59,478
           - $53,000,           

70
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,682
       and you still have       
 an opportunity to counteroffer.

71
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:05,884
            - No, no.           
   - There's so much going on.  

72
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:07,619
        - No. No, no, no,       
    look at the board, okay?    

73
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:08,687
         You had a goal.

       is not high enough.      

76
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:15,627

        - Don't take it.        

77

00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,631

       your counteroffer.       

349
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:38,056
            - Right.            
      - You still have two      

350
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:39,590
  really big numbers up there.  

351
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:40,892
       - Yes, really big.       
           - Oh, yes.           

352
00:17:40,994 --> 00:17:42,593
      - We may have reached     
     her goal a little bit.     

353
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:43,861
           [laughter]           

354
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:45,797
 Forget the $117,000, whatever. 

355
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:46,798
    Think about those numbers   
            up there.           

356
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,099
     - Forget the $117,000?     

357
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:50,101
         - For a second!        
   We're having a discussion.   

358
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:53,571
     - I can't forget that.     
     That's a lot of money.     

359
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:55,540
          - Think about         
    what the next five years    

360
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:56,607
   you have in store for you.   

361
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:58,309
       - Oh, that's a lot.      

362
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,677
         - That's a lot.        
            - I know.           

363
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:02,113
    - What's in store for you   
  in the five years? I don't--  

364
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:04,015
 - My kids are going to college,

365
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:06,818
    and I don't want them to    
  come out with a lot of loans, 

366
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,219
   and that would really help.  

367
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:10,721
 - That would do more than help.
             - Yes.             

368
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:12,557
           - You guys.          
 - What are you guys discussing?

369
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:13,958
    - I say she keeps going.    

370
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,960
   - Keeps going. No counter.   
    You're saying no counter.   

371
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:17,862
  - Not yet. I think she saves  
       the counter until--      

372
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:19,564
   if she loses one of those.   

373
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:20,932
    - Keep going, keep going.   

374
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:22,600
  - It's exactly what he said.  
      - One more, one more.     

375
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:25,336
          - Oh, Howie.          
       - Here's the thing.      

376
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:30,308
  Right now, the only guarantee 
      you have is $117,000,     

377
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,844
     but you also have luck,    
         you have risk,         

378
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:34,178
      and you have $300,000     

379
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,913
          and $400,000          
     left in the game, so...    

380
00:18:36,015 --> 00:18:38,116
           - Oh, gosh.          

381
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:39,851
               Oh.              

382
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:41,519
      - I'm gonna ask you.      

383
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,721
        Missy Silverman,        

384
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:45,590
      the biggest decision      
      so far of the night.      

385
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:46,858
       - Oh, gosh, this is      
         a big decision.        

386
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,593
       - Missy Silverman,       

387
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:50,361
        deal or no deal?        

388
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:51,729
           - No deal.           

389
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:54,232
        [crowd shouting]        

390
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:56,701
        - I say, no deal!       

391
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,469
            No deal.            

392
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:02,173
             - Wow.             
   - Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.  

393
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:06,410
   I can't believe I did that.  
      That's so much money.     

394
00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:08,312
     - It's a lot of money.     

395
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:12,617
      The question now is,      
     will your luck hold on?    

396
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:14,218
         One more case.         

397
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,823
     - Okay, one more case,     
       and I want the $5.       

398
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:21,592
      I want to see the $5.     

399
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:26,497
           Oh, girls.           
     Oh, all these numbers.     

400
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,799
    - You know, it's possible   
           that the $5          

401
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:30,535
  could be in this case, right? 

402
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:33,171
    Just as much of a chance.   

403
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:35,072
            - Oh. Oh!           

404
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:38,176
           [laughter]           

405
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:42,847
     Okay, let's go with 25!    

406
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:45,383
            - Summer.           
      - I don't even know.      

407
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:47,652
           I'm scared.          
       - Summer, anything.      

408
00:19:47,754 --> 00:19:49,153
        She wants the $5,       

409
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:51,355
      but I would be happy      
          with anything         

410
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:55,459
        but the $300,000        
        or the $400,000.        

411
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:57,128
         One more time.         

412
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,663
      Hold onto that luck.      
         - Oh, my gosh.         

413
00:19:58,765 --> 00:20:02,099
    - Summer, open the case.    

414
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:04,769
   - I can't look. I'm scared.  

415
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:06,404
     Please, low, low, five,    

416
00:20:06,506 --> 00:20:08,973
    low, low, low, low, low,    

417
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:10,408
           I'm scared.          

418
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,576
     - Well, you're amazing.    

419
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:13,110
         I want my kids         
    to go to your preschool.    

420
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:15,179
             - Aww!             

421
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:18,616
       - Not just because       
   you're so kind and giving,   

422
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,551
        but also, I think       
     you're the only person     

423
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:22,720
            who could           
    run circles around them.    

424
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:25,690
        - Oh, thank you.        
  Give me a low number, please. 

425
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:27,625
            [laughs]            

426
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:28,726
             Please.            

427
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:33,464
         [all groaning]         

428
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:38,302
           [applause]           

429
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:42,006
    - Okay, before she calls,   
  I'm gonna tell you something. 

430
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:45,076
      You still have a one      
       out of four chance       

431
00:20:45,178 --> 00:20:48,045
     of walking out of here     
         with $400,000.         

432
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:50,214
  If you decide to go further,  

433
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:52,283
      or you make an offer,     
   and she doesn't accept it,   

434
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:53,918
        and you're forced       
         to go further,         

435
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,087
  you have a three out of four  
        chance of opening       

436
00:20:56,189 --> 00:20:59,323
   anything but the $400,000,   

437
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:02,159
    which will make the offer   
      after this one go up.     

438
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:03,628
             - Okay.            
   - So can you take the risk?  

439
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:04,895
       Do you feel lucky?       

440
00:21:04,998 --> 00:21:06,264
       Do you want to make      
         a counteroffer?        

441
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:08,032
   We're about to get a call.   
     Let's see what this is.    

442
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:09,700
      - Oh, I'm so nervous.     

443
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:11,502
        - Yes, of course,       
  she's going to go down. Yeah. 

444
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:15,206
        - I'm so nervous.       

445
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:16,741
            - Hello.            

446
00:21:18,344 --> 00:21:19,944
              Okay.             

447
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:25,082
              Okay.             

448
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:26,884
     She said the safety net    
            is gone.            

449
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:31,222
     She said you're lucky,     
       but not that lucky.      

450
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:35,926
   - That's okay, that's okay.  
    I'm still feeling lucky.    

451
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:37,762
      - The offer dropped.      

452
00:21:37,864 --> 00:21:38,763
       - I knew it would.       

453
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:42,700
   - The new offer is $84,000.  

454
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,568
     - Talk to your family.     
     - Talk to your family.     

455
00:21:44,671 --> 00:21:45,903
   - This is your counteroffer  
              time.             

456
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:47,038
    - Maybe now you counter.    

457
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,205
       - One case to open.      
           - How much?          

458
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:49,507
           - $95,000.           
       - I think $95,000.       

459
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:52,043
          - Okay, okay.         
 - You counter and you be happy.

460
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:57,381
             - Okay.            
  I'm not really good at math.  

461
00:21:57,483 --> 00:22:00,151
       - Missy Silverman,       
        deal or no deal?        

462
00:22:00,253 --> 00:22:03,087
     - Well, I think I might    
   make a counteroffer, Howie.  

463
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:06,123
       - Okay, counter up.      
       And the offer is...      

464
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:10,227
           - $95,000.

            - Right.            

584
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:24,968
   - 13 is my son's birthday.   

585
00:28:26,672 --> 00:28:29,907
           And then 7           
      is my dad's birthday.     

586
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:32,076
          Oh, my gosh,          
    I don't know what to do.    

587
00:28:32,178 --> 00:28:33,277
  Okay, I'm gonna just say it.  

588
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:34,978
            - Say it.           
      - It's coming to me.      

589
00:28:35,081 --> 00:28:37,881
 I'm praying it's a low number. 

590
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:42,052
          Number 7! Oh!         

591
00:28:42,154 --> 00:28:43,854
          - Oh, my God.         
   - That's what I would pick.  

592
00:28:43,956 --> 00:28:45,456
    I would have picked that.   

593
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:48,225
       - We're gonna pray,      
 we're gonna pray. I'm praying. 

594
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:51,895
         - This one case        
   can make you or break you.   

595
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:53,864
     - I hope it's make me.     

596

           [laughter]           

597
00:28:55,401 --> 00:29:00,604
      - Jordana, anything,      
     anything but $400,000.     

598
00:29:00,706 --> 00:29:03,040
           - So scary.          
        - Open the case.        

599
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:06,510
       - I'm not looking.       

600
00:29:08,781 --> 00:29:10,881
          Please, low.

            Yay, yay!           

603
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:16,420
          That's good.          

604
00:29:16,522 --> 00:29:17,654
         - That's great.        
         - That's good.         

605
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:19,890
        - That's awesome!       

606
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:20,991
      [cheers and applause]     

607
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:22,226
         - I'm so happy!        

608
00:29:24,797 --> 00:29:26,997
          That's good.          
       That's pretty good.      

609
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:29,233
          Oh, my gosh.          
        Oh, my gosh. Oh.        

610
00:29:29,335 --> 00:29:32,836
 - Wow, look at that board now. 
  So you got three cases left.  

611
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:35,172
           One of them          
      is holding $400,000.      

612
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:36,473
   You believe it's this one?   

613
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:39,476
         - I don't know.        
          It could be.          

614
00:29:39,578 --> 00:29:42,212
         [phone ringing]

00:29:42,314 --> 00:29:45,048
             Oh, no.            

616
00:29:45,151 --> 00:29:48,585
      Oh, I'm freaking out.     

617
00:29:48,687 --> 00:29:52,956
       Oh, Howie, banker,

00:29:56,896 --> 00:29:58,328
         Hello, models.

622
00:29:59,732 --> 00:30:02,065
          - All right.          
        - What'd she say?       

623
00:30:02,168 --> 00:30:04,301
        Please, shaking.        

624
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:06,336
      - She said you pushed     
           your luck.           

625
00:30:06,438 --> 00:30:08,238
         - Yes, you did.

627
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:15,312

628
00:30:15,414 --> 00:30:16,780
     - You say it paid off.     
             - Yeah.            

629
00:30:16,882 --> 00:30:18,515
  - They're saying it paid off. 
    Do you think it paid off?   

630
00:30:18,617 --> 00:30:20,551
           - I don't--          
      I hope so, I hope so.     

631
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:24,054
         Oh, I hope so.         
       I hope it paid off.      

632
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:25,923
        - It did, it did.       

633
00:30:26,025 --> 00:30:28,692
   - You would have walked out  
  of here with $95,000, right?  

634
00:30:28,794 --> 00:30:30,561
          - If she took         
       that counter, yes.       

635
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:32,996
             - Yeah.            
          - She didn't.         

636
00:30:33,098 --> 00:30:38,635
    - Would you walk out now    
          for $165,000?         

637
00:30:38,737 --> 00:30:41,438

651
00:31:13,973 --> 00:31:16,773
        deal or no deal?        

652
00:31:16,876 --> 00:31:20,577
      [cheers and applause]     

653
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:21,879

    Okay, so congratulations.   

662
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:47,037
        You got $165,000,       
 you got a dream vacation, okay,

663
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:50,874
        but we don't know       
    if you made a good deal.    

664
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:51,875
           - We don't.          

665
00:31:51,977 --> 00:31:53,410
     - Had you said no deal     

666
00:31:53,512 --> 00:31:55,279
   and you went one more time,  

667
00:31:55,381 --> 00:31:57,681
     the next case you would    
 have opened would have been... 

668
00:31:57,783 --> 00:32:00,684
            - Eight.            
  - Okay, Neka, open your case. 

669
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,888

670
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,657
        - Perfect timing.       

671
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:08,525
        You got out right       
       at the right time.       

672
00:32:08,627 --> 00:32:10,961
    You had the $50,000 case.   

673
00:32:11,063 --> 00:32:13,063
         Open your case.        

674
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:17,901
      Wow, Missy Silverman

00:32:18,003 --> 00:32:20,170
   Ran inf here
