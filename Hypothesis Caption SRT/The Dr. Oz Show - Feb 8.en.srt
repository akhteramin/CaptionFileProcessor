  Imagine what you can do with  
  more migraine-free days.

00:20:49,771 --> 00:20:50,937

00:20:54,275 --> 00:20:55,841
    (Announcer)                 
    When you're not fighting    
    through migraine            

562
00:20:55,943 --> 00:20:57,777
   imagine the possibilities.   

563
00:20:57,879 --> 00:21:00,846
 Once-monthly Emgality is used  
 for the prevention             

564
00:21:00,882 --> 00:21:02,114
     of migraine in adults.     

565
00:21:02,216 --> 00:21:04,250
 It's specifically developed to 
 help give you                  

566
00:21:04,285 --> 00:21:05,885
    more migraine-free days.    

567
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,355
 With Emgality about 60% of     
 people had their migraine days 

568
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:10,623
      cut in half or more.      

569
00:21:10,725 --> 00:21:13,559
Do not use if you are allergic  
to Emgality or its ingredients. 

570
00:21:14,795 --> 00:21:16,829
  Emgality may cause allergic   
  reactions, such as            

571
00:21:16,864 --> 00:21:18,931
    itching, rash, hives and    
    trouble breathing,          

572
00:21:18,966 --> 00:21:20,466
which can happen days after use.

573
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,501
Call your doctor or get medical 
help right away                 

574
00:21:22,536 --> 00:21:24,469
   if you have symptoms of an   
   allergic reaction.           

575
00:21:24,505 --> 00:21:25,837
      The most common side      
      effects include           

576
00:21:25,873 --> 00:21:27,272
   injection site reactions.

THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE CHANGES

THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE CHANGES  
ARE GOING TO BE THERE, BUT IF

YOU ARE NOT SURE, CALL YOUR

YOU ARE NOT SURE, CALL YOUR     
DERMATOLOGIST.                  

1155
00:47:33,343 --> 00:47:36,111
DERMATOLOGIST.                  
MAKE SURE YOU DON'T MAKE ANY

YOU ARE ALL GOING HOME WITH A   

1158
00:49:03,064 --> 00:49:04,731
     When you feed yourself     
           some oats,           

1159
00:49:04,766 --> 00:49:06,599
 the oats feed your body fiber. 

1160
00:49:06,635 --> 00:49:09,235
    Fiber helps keep things     
  moving through your system.   

1161
00:49:09,271 --> 00:49:10,136
        Which is great.         

1162
00:49:10,171 --> 00:49:12,138
    Because when you're good    
        to your system,         

1163
00:49:12,173 --> 00:49:14,173
     it'll be good to you.

 Do you push through migraine?  

1165
00:49:20,181 --> 00:49:21,681
    (Daughter)                  
    Mom, are you OK to play?    

1166
00:49:21,983 --> 00:49:24,250
(Mom)                           
Yeah honey, how about we play...

1167

     princess and pirates?      

1168
00:49:26,788 --> 00:49:29,689
  (Announcer)                   
  Imagine what you can do with  
  more migraine-free days.      

1169
00:49:34,529 --> 00:49:35,695
            (Pirate)            
            Arr!

           (Mom)                
           En garde!            

1171
00:49:39,033 --> 00:49:40,599
    (Announcer)                 
    When you're not fighting    
    through migraine            

1172
00:49:40,701 --> 00:49:42,535
   imagine the possibilities.   

1173
00:49:42,637 --> 00:49:45,604
 Once-monthly Emgality is used  
 for the prevention             

1174
00:49:45,706 --> 00:49:46,872
     of migraine in adults.     

1175
00:49:46,974 --> 00:49:49,008
 It's specifically developed to 
 help give you                  

1176
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:50,643
    more migraine-free days.    

1177
00:49:50,878 --> 00:49:54,113
 With Emgality about 60% of     
 people had their migraine days 

1178
00:49:54,215 --> 00:49:55,381
      cut in half or more.      

1179
00:49:55,483 --> 00:49:58,317
Do not use if you are allergic  
to Emgality or its ingredients. 

1180
00:49:59,553 --> 00:50:01,587
  Emgality may cause allergic   
  reactions, such as            

1181
00:50:01,689 --> 00:50:03,689
    itching, rash, hives and    
    trouble breathing,          

1182
00:50:03,791 --> 00:50:05,224
which can happen days after use.

1183
00:50:05,526 --> 00:50:07,259
Call your doctor or get medical 
help right away                 

1184
00:50:07,361 --> 00:50:09,227
   if you have symptoms of an   
   allergic reaction.           

1185
00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:10,595
      The most common side      
      effects include           

1186
00:50:10,698 --> 00:50:12,030
   injection site reactions.

  What should we do tomorrow?   

1188
00:50:13,567 --> 00:50:15,167
(Announcer)

Who said olive oil is the only  
heart-healthy cooking oil?      

1311
00:54:28,484 --> 00:54:30,418
Mazola corn oil has more        
cholesterol-blocking            

1312
00:54:30,453 --> 00:54:32,353
plant sterols than olive oil.   

1313
00:54:32,388 --> 00:54:33,988
And a clinical study showed     
it can help

    When you're not fighting    
    through migraine            

1325
00:55:17,967 --> 00:55:19,800
   imagine the possibilities.   

1326
00:55:19,902 --> 00:55:22,869
 Once-monthly Emgality is used  
 for the prevention             

1327
00:55:22,905 --> 00:55:24,137
     of migraine in adults.     

1328
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:26,273
 It's specifically developed to 
 help give you                  

1329
00:55:26,308 --> 00:55:27,908
    more migraine-free days.    

1330
00:55:28,143 --> 00:55:31,378
 With Emgality about 60% of     
 people had their migraine days 

1331
00:55:31,413 --> 00:55:32,646
      cut in half or more.      

1332
00:55:32,748 --> 00:55:35,582
Do not use if you are allergic  
to Emgality or its ingredients. 

1333
00:55:36,818 --> 00:55:38,852
  Emgality may cause allergic   
  reactions, such as            

1334
00:55:38,887 --> 00:55:40,954
    itching, rash, hives and    
    trouble breathing,          

1335
00:55:40,989 --> 00:55:42,489
which can happen days after use.

1336
00:55:42,791 --> 00:55:44,524
Call your doctor or get medical 
help right away                 

1337
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:46,493

   allergic reaction.           

1338
00:55:46,528 --> 00:55:47,861
      The most common side      
      effects include           

1339
00:55:47,896 --> 00:55:49,295
