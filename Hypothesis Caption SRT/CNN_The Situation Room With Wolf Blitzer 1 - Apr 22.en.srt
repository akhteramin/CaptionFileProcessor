INITIALLY, MR. MUELLER COULD NOT
EXONERATE THE PRESIDENT FROM    

584
00:16:05,236 --> 00:16:05,668
EXONERATE THE PRESIDENT FROM    
THAT CHARGE.                    

585
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:11,373
THAT CHARGE.                    
SO THAT IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT   

586
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:11,573
SO THAT IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT   
ISSUE.                          

587
00:16:11,575 --> 00:16:12,341
ISSUE.                          
WITH RESPECT TO THE CONSPIRAC

WITH RESPECT TO THE CONSPIRAC   
ISSUE, THE BARR LETTER SUGGESTED

589
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:13,642
ISSUE, THE BARR LETTER SUGGESTED
THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THERE.   

590
00:16:13,644 --> 00:16:18,280
THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THERE.   
BUT WHEN IT CAME DOWN TO THE    

591
00:16:18,282 --> 00:16:19,448
BUT WHEN IT CAME DOWN TO THE    
OBSTRUCTION CHARGE, HE WAS VERY,

592
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,050
OBSTRUCTION CHARGE, HE WAS VERY,
I THINK, SPECIFIC IN QUOTING    

593
00:16:21,052 --> 00:16:21,984
I THINK, SPECIFIC IN QUOTING    
DIRECTLY FROM ALL OF THE REPORT 

594
00:16:21,986 --> 00:16:23,252
DIRECTLY FROM ALL OF THE REPORT 
THAT HE COULD NOT BE EXONERATED.

595
00:16:23,254 --> 00:16:24,520
THAT HE COULD NOT BE EXONERATED.
THE PRESIDENT COULD NOT BE      

596
00:16:24,522 --> 00:16:24,820
THE PRESIDENT COULD NOT BE      
EXONERATED.                     

597
00:16:24,822 --> 00:16:25,888
EXONERATED.                     
SO I THINK YOU HAVE AN ISSUE    

598
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:26,121
SO I THINK YOU HAVE AN ISSUE    
THERE.                          

599
00:16:26,123 --> 00:16:28,224
THERE.                          
AND I THINK THE BEST WAY TO     

600
00:16:28,226 --> 00:16:31,460
AND I THINK THE BEST WAY TO     
PROCEED IS THROUGH FURTHER      

601
00:16:31,462 --> 00:16:32,795
PROCEED IS THROUGH FURTHER      
INVESTIGATION.                  

602
00:16:32,797 --> 00:16:35,564
INVESTIGATION.                  
CALLING FIRST DIRECTOR MUELLER, 

603
00:16:35,566 --> 00:16:36,365
CALLING FIRST DIRECTOR MUELLER, 
WHO CAN GIVE CONTEXT.           

604
00:16:36,367 --> 00:16:38,801
WHO CAN GIVE CONTEXT.           
I MEAN, IF HIS WHOLE REPORT WAS 

605
00:16:38,803 --> 00:16:40,436
I MEAN, IF HIS WHOLE REPORT WAS 
BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT HE    

606
00:16:40,438 --> 00:16:41,871
BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT HE    
THOUGHT WAS APPROPRIATE, THAT HE

607
00:16:41,873 --> 00:16:43,105
THOUGHT WAS APPROPRIATE, THAT HE
COULD NEVER CHARGE THE          

608
00:16:43,107 --> 00:16:45,808
COULD NEVER CHARGE THE

609
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:46,275
PRESIDENT, BECAUSE THAT WAS A   
POLICY OF THE JUSTICE           

610
00:16:46,277 --> 00:16:46,909
POLICY OF THE JUSTICE           
DEPARTMENT, THAT A PRESIDENT    

611
00:16:46,911 --> 00:16:49,411

CANNOT BE CHARGED, CAN ONLY BE  

612
00:16:49,413 --> 00:16:50,212

IMPEACHED, I THINK THAT PUTS    

613
00:16:50,214 --> 00:16:51,747
IMPEACHED, I THINK THAT PUTS    
THIS WHOLE REPORT INTO A        

614
00:16:51,749 --> 00:16:52,782
THIS WHOLE REPORT INTO A        
SPECIFIC CONTEXT THAT WILL BE   

615
00:16:52,784 --> 00:16:53,582

VERY USEFUL.                    

616
00:16:53,584 --> 00:16:55,050
VERY USEFUL.

EVEN THE REDACTED PORTIONS.     
IT COULD BE CONTROLLED IN TERMS 

620
00:16:59,524 --> 00:17:04,827
IT COULD BE CONTROLLED IN TERMS

683
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:43,626
     My experience with USAA    

684
00:18:43,628 --> 00:18:45,027
       has been excellent.      

685
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:46,796
     They really appreciate     
     the military family        

686
00:18:46,965 --> 00:18:47,830
      and it really shows.      

687
00:18:48,199 --> 00:18:49,699
    With all that USAA offers   

688
00:18:49,701 --> 00:18:50,967
    why go with anybody else?   

689
00:18:50,969 --> 00:18:52,301
      We know                   
      their rates are good,     

690
00:18:52,303 --> 00:18:52,902

  It was an instant savings and 

693
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,839
     I should have changed      
     a long time ago.           

694
00:18:56,841 --> 00:18:58,274

   another insurance company,   

696
00:19:00,211 --> 00:19:02,045
