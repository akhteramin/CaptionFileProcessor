Little bit more about yourself. 

96
00:02:54,576 --> 00:02:56,309
When did you get started        
into music?                     

97
00:02:56,377 --> 00:02:57,844
              - So, my dad being
            a basketball player,

98
00:02:57,912 --> 00:03:00,246
    we actually had a basketball
             court in our house.

99
00:03:00,315 --> 00:03:01,748
            - Indoor.           
         - And...indoor.        

100
00:03:01,816 --> 00:03:04,650
      Whenever he was practicing
        and I would be with him,

101
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:06,052
                    I was always
             more concerned with

102
00:03:06,121 --> 00:03:07,386
      what we were listening to.

103
00:03:07,455 --> 00:03:08,621
               So we'd be, like,
                 shooting hoops,

104
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:09,922
           and all of the sudden
                    I'd be like,

105
00:03:09,991 --> 00:03:11,557
          "Okay, we gotta change
                      the song."

106
00:03:11,626 --> 00:03:13,192
                 So from then on
                it was just like

107
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:14,560
             music was my dream.

108
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:16,262
  Worked my way up from there.  
             - Nice.            

109
00:03:16,331 --> 00:03:17,630
And when you travel             

110
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:19,532
and you speak

             - Okay.            
         - There we go.         

341
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:35,736
                - Spill the tea.

342
00:10:35,805 --> 00:10:36,871
         - It's a girl.         

343
00:10:36,939 --> 00:10:38,472
            both: Oh.           

344
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:40,775
    - Is that, like, kind of    
     a serious thing, or...     

345
00:10:40,843 --> 00:10:42,043
- Yeah, we've been dating       
for a year.                     

346
00:10:42,111 --> 00:10:43,678
            - Really?           

347
00:10:43,746 --> 00:10:45,680
     Does she know about...     
              - No.             

348
00:10:45,748 --> 00:10:46,647
           - Ray'Quan?          

349
00:10:46,716 --> 00:10:48,516
        - You do like the drama.

350
00:10:48,584 --> 00:10:50,284
      - The drama likes me.     

351
00:10:50,353 --> 00:10:52,286
I don't like drama.             
Drama likes me.                 

352
00:10:52,355 --> 00:10:54,355
      - Are you guys, like,     
      taking a break, or...     

353
00:10:54,424 --> 00:10:55,156
- No.                           

354
00:10:55,224 --> 00:10:57,558
But Cierra just went back home  

355
00:10:57,627 --> 00:10:59,694
for, like, six months,          
and then she's gonna come back. 

356
00:10:59,762 --> 00:11:00,861
I was like, well,               
might as well try to...         

357
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:01,996
see what's up with him 'cause   

358
00:11:02,065 --> 00:11:03,464
she's gonna be gone             
for a while.                    

359
00:11:03,533 --> 00:11:05,166
And I'm, like, bored--          
I don't want to be bored.       

360
00:11:05,235 --> 00:11:06,400
    - Does Ray'Quan know that   
     you have a girlfriend?     

361
00:11:06,469 --> 00:11:07,301
- No.                           

362
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,502
       - Does Cierra think      

363
00:11:08,571 --> 00:11:11,339
     you guys are exclusive     
         and monogamous?        

364
00:11:11,407 --> 00:11:12,607
- Yes.                          

365
00:11:12,675 --> 00:11:15,409
              - Does Cierra know
         that you also date men?

366
00:11:15,478 --> 00:11:16,477
              - No.             

367
00:11:16,546 --> 00:11:18,112
But I love both of them.        

368
00:11:18,181 --> 00:11:20,414
   We could all be a throuple.  
   I think we could be, like,   

369
00:11:20,483 --> 00:11:21,949
        I want to be with       
        the both of them.       

370
00:11:22,018 --> 00:11:23,117
             - Okay.            
  - Do you think she'd be down? 

371
00:11:23,186 --> 00:11:24,986
        - You never know.       
             - Wow.             

372
00:11:25,054 --> 00:11:26,387
       - Cierra makes you happy?

373
00:11:26,456 --> 00:11:27,822
      - Yeah, she's, like,      
          really good.          

374
00:11:27,891 --> 00:11:29,624
   Like, to talk to too, and--  

375
00:11:29,692 --> 00:11:32,660
                - So why--what's
            stopping commitment?

376
00:11:32,729 --> 00:11:34,095
- I'm only 23,                  

377
00:11:34,164 --> 00:11:35,730
and I'm not trying to be,       
like, married right now.        

378
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:37,165
             - Fair.            
             - Yeah.            

379
00:11:37,233 --> 00:11:39,400
 But I do think Cierra deserves 

380
00:11:39,469 --> 00:11:42,136
   the respect of being kinda   
   filled in on the situation.  

381
00:11:42,205 --> 00:11:44,138
   While we want to help you,   

382
00:11:44,207 --> 00:11:46,707
 we also don't wanna participate

383
00:11:46,776 --> 00:11:51,079
  in what Cierra would probably 
      think of as cheating.     

384
00:11:51,147 --> 00:11:54,749
     It'd be nice, I think,     
      to kinda fill her in.     

385
00:11:54,818 --> 00:11:56,851
   So think about how and when  
      you want to do that.      

386
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,119
- Okay.                         

387
00:11:58,188 --> 00:12:00,354
- Okay. Can we see a picture    
of Ray'Quan?                    

388
00:12:00,423 --> 00:12:01,422
- Okay.                         

389
00:12:01,524 --> 00:12:03,024
        - Show us your...       
         - Your profile.        

390
00:12:03,093 --> 00:12:04,292
  - Your conversation with him. 

391
00:12:04,361 --> 00:12:05,460
      - This is my.             
           That's me.

    She's very pretty.

402
00:12:20,777 --> 00:12:22,110
- You are very talented.        

403
00:12:22,178 --> 00:12:23,911
    - And show us, uh, Ray'Quan.

00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,680
        Is that him, or?        
             - Yeah.            

405
00:12:25,749 --> 00:12:27,849
                    - Okay. He's
             a good-looking guy.

406
00:12:27,951 --> 00:12:28,916
- Can we look at the messages?  

407
00:12:28,985 --> 00:12:30,218
             - Okay.            

408
00:12:30,287 --> 00:12:31,919
          We was, like,         
    sending different memes,    

409
00:12:31,988 --> 00:12:33,354
          and, like...          

410
00:12:33,423 --> 00:12:35,089
     We were texting earlier    
         and I was like,        

411
00:12:35,158 --> 00:12:36,090
        "Can you call me        
         on your break?"        

412
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:37,091
     He's been mean lately.     

413
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,259
         He gets so mad         

414
00:12:38,328 --> 00:12:39,994
  when I call him babe or bae.  

415
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,329
- That's interesting.           

416
00:12:41,398 --> 00:12:43,097
- I ow why he                   
be acting like that.            

417
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:44,732
He's just a private person.     

418
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:46,334
      - I mean, is it possible--
        have you ever considered

419
00:12:46,403 --> 00:12:48,736
             that maybe he's not
                  that into you?

420
00:12:48,805 --> 00:12:50,405
  - I think y'all are reaching. 
       - You guys ever say      

421
00:12:50,473 --> 00:12:52,440
          "I love you"?         
  - I say it, but he'd be like,

            "Yeah..."

423
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,543
             - Yeah.            
  He'd be like, "Uh-huh. Bye."  

424
00:12:55,612 --> 00:12:57,111
              - Oh.             
   - He's never said it back.   

425
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,881
         - No, not that

00:19:53,298 --> 00:19:54,564
See what we get.                

572
00:19:54,632 --> 00:19:57,500
            No name.            
 - Trenton, New Jersey, however.

573
00:19:57,569 --> 00:19:59,769
- Okay, New Jersey checks out.  

574
00:19:59,837 --> 00:20:02,004
All right, so here are          
pictures of Ray'Quan.           

575
00:20:02,073 --> 00:20:05,541
And let's see                   
if any of these come up.        

576
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:08,311
A                               
All right. First one.           

577
00:20:08,413 --> 00:20:09,512
            both: No.           

578
00:20:09,581 --> 00:20:11,881
Second pic.                     

579
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:12,982
Okay, nothing.                  

580
00:20:13,051 --> 00:20:16,085
Last picture.                   

581
00:20:16,187 --> 00:20:17,119
                       - Oh--no.

582
00:20:17,188 --> 00:20:18,554
- Nothing on the pictures.      

583
00:20:18,623 --> 00:20:20,189
So let's just look a little bit 
at his Instagram.               

584
00:20:20,258 --> 00:20:23,493
This is Ray'Quan's Instagram.   
Selfie.gawdd.                   

585
00:20:23,561 --> 00:20:24,760
                 - Six pictures.

586
00:20:24,829 --> 00:20:26,362
              How many followers
                   does he have?

587
00:20:26,431 --> 00:20:28,064
- 2,700.                        

588
00:20:28,133 --> 00:20:30,266
I mean, this feels like         
a fake account.                 

589
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,601
   - Let's look at the comments.

590
00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:33,669
        - Yeah, let's go        
       to the first post.       

591
00:20:33,738 --> 00:20:34,904
     All right. Here we go.     

592
00:20:34,973 --> 00:20:36,672
      This guy, hymnsofly,      

593
00:20:36,741 --> 00:20:38,274
     commented on Ray'Quan's    
         oldest picture.        

594
00:20:38,343 --> 00:20:39,575
           - The oldest picture.

595
00:20:39,644 --> 00:20:41,377
                Is he commenting
               on anything else?

596
00:20:41,446 --> 00:20:43,513
- Yes, the most recent photo.   

597
00:20:43,581 --> 00:20:45,882
Hymnsofly, "3 more weeks        
I can't wait."                  

598
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,017
Maybe they know each other      
in real life.                   

599
00:20:48,086 --> 00:20:49,552
       - Who's hymnsofly?       
             - Yeah.            

600
00:20:49,621 --> 00:20:52,188
      His name is Dedrick.      
       - Private account.       

601
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:54,290
- But we could message          
and just say, like,             

602
00:20:54,392 --> 00:20:56,125
"How do you know Ray'Quan?"     

603
00:20:56,194 --> 00:20:58,328
      Let's try hymnsofly.      
         - Hymnsofly...         

604
00:20:58,396 --> 00:20:59,629
- All right.                    
[chime]                         

605
00:20:59,698 --> 00:21:01,597
All right, so we sent           
a message to Dedrick.           

606
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,099
So let's just look              
to see if Ray'Quan              

607
00:21:03,168 --> 00:21:04,667
is tagged on Instagram.         

608
00:21:04,736 --> 00:21:06,069
Is he tagged in anything?       

609
00:21:06,137 --> 00:21:09,939
Okay, so this guy tagged        
Ray'Quan in a photo.            

610
00:21:10,008 --> 00:21:12,075
 commented                      
"I miss you."                   

611
00:21:12,143 --> 00:21:13,209
Who is this?                    

612
00:21:13,278 --> 00:21:15,044
                 - That's Kevon.
              That's the friend.

613
00:21:15,113 --> 00:21:16,079
- You're right!                 

614
00:21:16,147 --> 00:21:17,547
        So wait a second.       
         - That's Kevon.        

615
00:21:17,616 --> 00:21:18,748
        - So there it is.       
          - So Kevon...         

616
00:21:18,817 --> 00:21:20,316
         is in a picture        

617
00:21:20,385 --> 00:21:23,253
 and personally knows Ray'Quan. 

618
00:21:23,321 --> 00:21:24,554
- This is a big deal.           

619
00:21:24,623 --> 00:21:25,888
          's huge.              
         - That is huge.        

620
00:21:25,957 --> 00:21:27,423
- Okay. We need                 
to message Kevon.               

621
00:21:27,492 --> 00:21:31,327
If he can confirm that he       
does, in fact, know Ray'Quan,   

622
00:21:31,396 --> 00:21:32,462
that'd be huge.                 

623
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,330
So sending.                     
All right, great.               

624
00:21:34,399 --> 00:21:36,699
Okay, so now we've got          
messages out                    

625
00:21:36,768 --> 00:21:39,235
to Dedrick                      
and this other guy, Kevon,      

626
00:21:39,304 --> 00:21:40,403
             who...             
             - Yes.             

627
00:21:40,472 --> 00:21:41,638
         - Is the link.         
        - Who's the link.       

628
00:21:41,706 --> 00:21:43,873
- And in the photo              
with Ray'Quan.                  

629
00:21:43,942 --> 00:21:45,909
  - We've not searched for Kevon
                    on Facebook.

630
00:21:45,977 --> 00:21:47,810
000■■right,                     
let's do that.

Oh, yeah, there he is.          

632
00:21:51,082 --> 00:21:52,515
-employed...                    
- Let's just see                
what's on his page.             

633
00:21:52,584 --> 00:21:54,117
Wait, what's this?              

634
00:21:54,186 --> 00:21:57,053
      Kevon was in Trenton.     
  - Okay, Kevon was in Trenton. 

635
00:21:57,122 --> 00:21:58,922
     "Coming home tomorrow."    
        - Wait a second.        

636
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:01,791
Trenton.                        
Exactly the same as Ray'Quan.   

637
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,092
Huh.                            

638
00:22:03,161 --> 00:22:05,328
Oh. Whoa!                       

639
00:22:05,397 --> 00:22:06,763
Holy [bleep].                   

640
00:22:06,832 --> 00:22:10,300
Kevon's Facebook--

642
00:22:12,737 --> 00:22:16,372
- Kevon's Facebook URL          
is selfie.gawdd.                

643
00:22:16,441 --> 00:22:17,874
■■■/■■■s=                       
It's almost the exact           
same thing                      

644
00:22:17,943 --> 00:22:20,543
as Ray'Quan's Instagram.        

645
00:22:20,612 --> 00:22:22,746
That right there                
is almost enough                

646
00:22:22,814 --> 00:22:24,881
to sort of...close the case.    

647
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,950
               - Truth has never
            hung out with Kevon.

648
00:22:27,018 --> 00:22:28,351
- Right, so he hasn't really    
heard his voice.                

649
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,286
 - And has never talked to him. 
            - Right.            

650
00:22:30,355 --> 00:22:32,255
- I bet you Ray'Quan            
doesn't exist, right?           

651
00:22:32,324 --> 00:22:34,624
          - Truth's been talking
                     to Kevon...

00:22:38,397 --> 00:22:39,796

   - Truth was adamant about.   

655
00:22:39,865 --> 00:22:40,964
        - Is that, "Oh■tand Kev"

656
00:22:41,033 --> 00:22:43,066
- Right. Kevon's, like,         
he's a mess.

And now there's a good chance   

659
00:22:46,938 --> 00:22:48,038
Kevon and Ray'Quan              
are the same person.

  - Dedrick. Are you hymnsofly?

        - Hey, what's up?       

665
00:22:58,116 --> 00:23:00,417
 We're talking to someone who's 
    been texting and talking

00:23:00,485 --> 00:23:01,985
    to your friend Ray'Quan.

        You commented on

670
00:23:08,727 --> 00:23:11,628
 - Can you tell us a little bit 
           about him?

Did he just hang up?

00:23:17,169 --> 00:23:19,636
    Should we call him back?

Could this just be Kevon?       
One of his many characters?     

678
00:23:30,749 --> 00:23:32,249
This could get really ugly.     

679
00:23:32,317 --> 00:23:33,617
               - It's malicious.

We know that Kevon              
was the connection              

682
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:40,040
between Ray'Quan and Truth.     

683
00:23:40,108 --> 00:23:43,877
                     - Kevon has
            the same Facebook...

684
00:23:43,946 --> 00:23:45,445
             - URL.             
              - URL             

685
00:23:45,514 --> 00:23:47,881
        as Ray'Quan's Instagram.

686
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,616
- So there's a good chance      

687
00:23:49,718 --> 00:23:51,151
the Ray'Quan Instagram page     
is fake                         

688
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,954
and Ray'Quan                    
was created by Kevon.           

689
00:23:54,022 --> 00:23:57,591
But Ray'Quan is tagged          
in a photo with Kevon in it,    

690
00:23:57,659 --> 00:24:00,560
so the guy in the picture       
is just someone Kevon knows,    

691
00:24:00,629 --> 00:24:02,562
but that's not Ray'Quan.        

692
00:24:02,631 --> 00:24:04,765
    his profile.                
   - This is not his profile.   

693
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:06,700
              You know, you have
              a circle of people

694

       who all connect together.

695
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:11,505
  And maybe people are trying to

696
00:24:11,573 --> 00:24:14,608
           blow up Truth's life.

996
00:36:54,405 --> 00:36:56,238
    So we did a search to see   
         if that number

00:37:04,616 --> 00:37:06,048
    And then we just thought,   

1001
00:37:06,117 --> 00:37:08,351
    let's see if he's tagged    
         in any photos.         

1002
00:37:08,419 --> 00:37:11,087
  He's tagged in two pictures.  
             - Okay.            

1003
00:37:11,155 --> 00:37:13,389
      - And one of them...

00:37:16,294 --> 00:37:18,294
             - Okay.            
   - So we sent him a message.  

1006
00:37:18,363 --> 00:37:22,398
   And we searched just to see  
    if Kevon had a Facebook.    

1007
00:37:22,467 --> 00:37:24,066
   And we found that he does.   

1008
00:37:24,135 --> 00:37:27,236
    But, more interestx  he's o,

1009

  exactly the same as Ray'Quan. 

1010
00:37:29,707 --> 00:37:31,774
    And then, check this out,   

1011
00:37:31,843 --> 00:37:34,810
     we looked at his URL...

        His Facebook page

00:58:14,222 --> 00:58:16,890
■■■■?■O■O■■                     
and seat happens,               
so it's strange to me that      

1492
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:19,226
this would be an inconvenience  
when, in fact, it feels like    

1493
00:58:19,328 --> 00:58:20,460
something you guys              
might have wanted               

1494
00:58:20,529 --> 00:58:21,962
to have done.                   

1495
00:58:22,030 --> 00:58:23,496
  - I mean, if it was something 
    I would have wanted done    

1496
00:58:23,565 --> 00:58:25,065
    I would have had it done.   

1497
00:58:25,133 --> 00:58:27,067
       I flirted with him,      
  but as far as a relationship, 

1498
00:58:27,135 --> 00:58:29,603
      we never talked about     
        no relationship.        

1499
00:58:29,671 --> 00:58:31,271
- The last six months           
for you has been...             

1500
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:32,505
       - It's just been somebody
                     to talk to.

1501
00:58:32,574 --> 00:58:33,874
                       A friend.

1502
00:58:33,942 --> 00:58:35,809
- So you donS■at anything you sd

1503
00:58:35,878 --> 00:58:37,978
over the last six months        
gave him the impression         

1504
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,980
that you were interested in him 
in a meaningful way.            

1505
00:58:40,048 --> 00:58:41,481
     flirt you

1507
00:58:43,585 --> 00:58:44,918
- Have you had feelings         
for him?                        

1508
00:58:44,987 --> 00:58:46,286
  - Yeah, he was a cool person  
           to talk to.          

1509
00:58:46,355 --> 00:58:49,890
       He still is a cool person
                     to talk to.

1510
00:58:49,958 --> 00:58:50,924
- If I'm a cool person,         
■'t- Yeah, my phone, it works.  

1511
00:58:50,993 --> 00:58:52,192
- So if your phone working,     

1512
00:58:52,261 --> 00:58:53,860
why you never                   
couldn't answer FaceTime?       

1513
00:58:53,929 --> 00:58:55,195
          Answer that.          
   - Because I didn't want to.  

1514
00:58:55,264 --> 00:58:56,763
- Why did you waste six months  
of my life?                     

1515
00:58:56,832 --> 00:58:58,131
           - You wasted your own
                     six months.

1516
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,299
    Nobody said that we were    
       in a relationship.       

1517
00:58:59,368 --> 00:59:00,667
          You did that.         

1518
00:59:00,736 --> 00:59:02,169
         - Are you dumb?        
       - No, are you dumb?      

1519
00:59:02,237 --> 00:59:03,637
         - Are you dumb?        
         - No, are you?         

1520
00:59:03,705 --> 00:59:04,871

if you're gonna ac this?        

1523
00:59:07,342 --> 00:59:08,575
      - Because y're gonna      
                    keep calling

                   gonna be him.

1534
00:59:28,263 --> 00:59:29,796

is wrong with him?              

1535
00:59:29,865 --> 00:59:31,498
      - I never said we was     
       in a relationship.       

1536
00:59:31,567 --> 00:59:32,866
       I never said that.       

1537
00:59:32,935 --> 00:59:34,434
    And then you going around   
         asking people,         

1538
00:59:34,536 --> 00:59:36,003
  having people call my phone.  

1539
00:59:36,071 --> 00:59:37,738
      "Oh, it's "Catfish,"      
     you going on "Catfish"?    

1540
00:59:37,806 --> 00:59:38,872
    Then you're trying to get   
       in contact with me.      

1541
00:59:38,941 --> 00:59:40,173
  That's embarrassing as hell.  

1542
00:59:40,242 --> 00:59:41,808
- Well, I understand            
your frustration.

00:59:41,877 --> 00:59:43,276

1545
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:47,080
         That's why I never said
         anything sexual to him.

1546
00:59:47,149 --> 00:59:48,682
          I never said,         
    "Oh, you're my boyfriend,   

1547

         nobody in that.

               <i> the whole story.</i>

1551
00:59:55,157 --> 00:59:56,790
      Sounds to me like he might
               have a boyfriend.

1552
00:59:56,859 --> 00:59:58,525

to do with it.

       - Hold on a second.      
   Hold on, h■■n.               

1715
01:08:31,408 --> 01:08:32,641
      - Why are you here though?

1716
01:08:32,710 --> 01:08:33,842
      - He brought me here=p=p=t

1717
01:08:33,911 --> 01:08:35,243
    And I'm here for support.   

1718
01:08:35,312 --> 01:08:36,745
         But also I came        
     because I heard, like,     

1719
01:08:36,814 --> 01:08:38,547
   the first conversation was,  
      like, super hostile,      

1720
01:08:38,616 --> 01:08:40,782
        so if it go down,       
    I'ma protect my friends.    

1721
01:08:40,851 --> 01:08:43,719
            - All right, let's--
    let's just do one at a time.

1722
01:08:43,787 --> 01:08:45,887
              I'm suredy        
           has something to say.

1723
01:08:45,956 --> 01:08:47,923
   So first we now understand   

1724
01:08:47,992 --> 01:08:50,058
      that the relationship     
      that was taking place     

1725
01:08:50,127 --> 01:08:51,426
        between you guys        

1726
01:08:51,495 --> 01:08:52,728
     was different for you--    
          - Just, like,         

1727
01:08:52,796 --> 01:08:54,663
       a friendship to me.      
             - Fine.            

1728
01:08:54,732 --> 01:08:57,299
       Can you explain why      
      your Instagram page--     

1729
01:08:57,368 --> 01:08:59,735

1730
01:08:59,803 --> 01:09:01,336

    - And your Facebook page.   

1731
01:09:01,405 --> 01:09:02,738

                 friends though.

1734
01:09:05,643 --> 01:09:06,875
- That was something            
we did as a joke.               

1735
01:09:06,944 --> 01:09:08,343
   - You guys just came up...   
        - You're clowns.        

1736
01:09:08,412 --> 01:09:09,878
           - With that          
      when you were young.      

1737
01:09:09,947 --> 01:09:11,413
     - Speak when spoken to.    
       - What the [bleep].      

1738
01:09:11,482 --> 01:09:12,648
   - Let me just talk to them   
          for a second.         

1739
01:09:12,716 --> 01:09:13,882
          - Nobody's control    
                       outh.    

1740
01:09:13,951 --> 01:09:15,217
      I'ma speak when I want to.

1741
01:09:15,286 --> 01:09:16,351
        But, Kevon,             
    when we messaged with you   

1742
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:17,820
        and you asked us        
        to meet you here        

1743
01:09:17,888 --> 01:09:19,588
  and then you didn't show up,  
       what was going on?       

1744
01:09:19,657 --> 01:09:22,458
  - Because he asked me not to. 
         - He called me.        

1745
01:09:22,526 --> 01:09:24,593
  - And I'm not a clout chaser. 
      I have my own clout.      

1746
01:09:24,662 --> 01:09:26,462
   Like I don't--I don't need   
          anybody else.

01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:28,230
        - I don't even know you.

1748
01:09:28,299 --> 01:09:29,198
