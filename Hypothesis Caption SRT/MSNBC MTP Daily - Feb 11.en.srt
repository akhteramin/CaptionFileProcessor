00:00:03,988 --> 00:00:07,122
  Guys do whatever it takes to  
  deal with shave irritation.   

2
00:00:07,158 --> 00:00:10,542
So, we re-imagined the razor    
with the new Gillette SkinGuar  

3
00:00:11,996 --> 00:00:14,529
     It has a unique guard      
     between the blades.        

4
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:18,000
  That's designed to reduce     
  irritation during the shave.  

5
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,172
 Because we believe all men     
 deserve a razor just for them. 

6
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:27,559
    The best a man can get.

00:31:18,611 --> 00:31:20,894
That's why we redesigned HUMIRA.

755
00:31:20,929 --> 00:31:22,396
We wanted to make

     you have an infection.
