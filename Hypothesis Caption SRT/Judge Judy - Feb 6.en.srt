Her children met my children,

Her children met my children,

Brillo Pad.

I found it in her room.

>> [ Chuckles ]                 
I found it in her room.         
So, she told me that Saturday   

329
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:36,045
I found it in her room.         
So, she told me that Saturday   
night she was leaving to go to  

330
00:06:36,047 --> 00:06:36,513
So, she told me that Saturday   
night she was leaving to go to  
work.                           

331
00:06:36,515 --> 00:06:38,214
night she was leaving to go to  
work.                           
She left her daughters at home  

332
00:06:38,216 --> 00:06:39,849
work.                           
She left her daughters at home  
with me and my two children.    

333
00:06:39,851 --> 00:06:41,084
She left her daughters at home  
with me and my two children.    
She left to go, and             

334
00:06:41,086 --> 00:06:42,952
with me and my two children.    
She left to go, and             
approximately noon the following

335
00:06:42,954 --> 00:06:44,521
She left to go, and             
approximately noon the following
day, November 5th, we were      

336
00:06:44,523 --> 00:06:45,188
approximately noon the following
day, November 5th, we were      
worried.                        

337
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,456
day, November 5th, we were      
worried.                        
The children were worried.      

338
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:47,357
worried.                        
The children were worried.      
So I Google up the              

339
00:06:47,359 --> 00:06:48,825
The children were worried.      
So I Google up the              
Milwaukee County inmate search, 

340
00:06:48,827 --> 00:06:50,560
So I Google up the              
Milwaukee County inmate search, 
saw that Melissa was, in fact,  

341
00:06:50,562 --> 00:06:52,362
Milwaukee County inmate search, 
saw that Melissa was, in fact,  
in custody and had been taken in

342
00:06:52,364 --> 00:06:53,063
saw that Melissa was, in fact,  
in custody and had been taken in
on a DUI.                       

343
00:06:53,065 --> 00:06:54,798
in custody and had been taken in
on a DUI.                       
That's when I need to see what's

344
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,698
on a DUI.                       
That's when I need to see what's
going on here.                  

345
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,300
That's when I need to see what's
going on here.                  
Her behavior had changed from   

346
00:06:57,302 --> 00:06:58,735
going on here.                  
Her behavior had changed from   
when she moved in with me       

347
00:06:58,737 --> 00:07:00,370
Her behavior had changed from   
when she moved in with me       
October 17th until the arrest.  

348
00:07:00,372 --> 00:07:02,072
when she moved in with me       
October 17th until the arrest.  
And the arrest was for her      

349
00:07:02,074 --> 00:07:02,872
October 17th until the arrest.  
And the arrest was for her      
fifth DUI.                      

350
00:07:02,874 --> 00:07:04,707
And the arrest was for her      
fifth DUI.                      
So, she's had four priors.      

351
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:05,742
fifth DUI.                      
So, she's had four priors.      
I don't know what happened with 

352
00:07:05,744 --> 00:07:06,776
So, she's had four priors.      
I don't know what happened with 
the fifth, but that's what she  

353
00:07:06,778 --> 00:07:07,410
I don't know what happened with 
the fifth, but that's what she  
was arrested for.               

354
00:07:07,412 --> 00:07:08,545
the fifth, but that's what she  
was arrested for.               
>> Judge Judy: Did she have her

For their stability, I let them 
stay with their father.

For their stability, I let them 
stay with their father.

>> Judge Judy: What happened    
with the car?

go to the DMV.                  

369
00:07:24,162 --> 00:07:26,429
came to me and asked if I would 
go to the DMV.                  
She signed the title over, and I

370
00:07:26,431 --> 00:07:28,498
go to the DMV.                  
She signed the title over, and I
paid for registration, title,   

371
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,866
She signed the title over, and I
paid for registration, title,

00:07:29,868 --> 00:07:31,501

373
00:07:31,503 --> 00:07:33,336

So, we did that because she     
could not get it out of impound 

374
00:07:33,338 --> 00:07:34,104
So, we did that because she     
could not get it out of impound 
without...                      

375
00:07:34,106 --> 00:07:35,171

00:07:41,446 --> 00:07:42,312

of these prior DUIs.            
So I paid for that...           

384
00:07:42,314 --> 00:07:43,279
of these prior DUIs.

You want to tell me your version

dancing around and you're

dancing around.                 

873

dancing around and you're       
dancing around.                 
And instead of saying, "Somebody

874
00:22:26,592 --> 00:22:28,025
dancing around.                 
And instead of saying, "Somebody
made a nice gesture, somebody   

875
00:22:28,027 --> 00:22:29,292
And instead of saying, "Somebody

who is not related to me,       

876
00:22:29,294 --> 00:22:30,727
made a nice gesture, somebody   
who is not related to me,

somebody who probably doesn't   
even like me made a gesture" -- 
And it was made clear to you    

879
00:22:35,901 --> 00:22:38,568
even like me made a gesture" -- 
And it was made clear to you    
before you took the check by her

880
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:40,704
And it was made clear to you    
before you took the check by her
that you had to pay her father  

881
00:22:40,706 --> 00:22:41,304

back.

So, before you took the check,  

884
00:22:44,376 --> 00:22:45,875
That's what she said.           
So, before you took the check,  
you knew you had to do that.    

885
00:22:45,877 --> 00:22:46,576
So, before you took the check,  
you knew you had to do that.    
Very easy.                      

886
00:22:46,578 --> 00:22:47,978
you knew you had to do that.    
Very easy.                      
You knew it wasn't a gift.

Very easy.                      
You knew it wasn't a gift.      
So, now you're standing in front

888
00:22:49,848 --> 00:22:51,448
You knew it wasn't a gift.      
So, now you're standing in front
of him in his living room,      

889
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:52,048
So, now you're standing in front
of him in his living room,      
and...?                         

890
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:53,383

and...?                         
>> I told him, "Thank you," and 
then he asked about the trip

then he asked about the trip    
that I was supposed to make.    

893
00:22:55,787 --> 00:22:57,787
then he asked about the trip    
that I was supposed to make.    
And the conversation ended.     

894
00:22:57,789 --> 00:22:59,088
that I was supposed to make.    
And the conversation ended.
