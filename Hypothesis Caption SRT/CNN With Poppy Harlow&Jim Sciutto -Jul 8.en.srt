ALTHOUGH THERE WAS COMPLAINING,

ALTHOUGH THERE WAS COMPLAINING, 
NANCY DID GET HER VERSION

I DO THINK THIS IS AN           

771
00:31:30,751 --> 00:31:32,818
I DO THINK THIS IS AN           
IDEALOGICAL AND A TACTICAL      

772
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,186
IDEALOGICAL AND A TACTICAL      
DIVISION WITHIN THESE WOMEN.    

773
00:31:34,188 --> 00:31:36,088
DIVISION WITHIN THESE WOMEN.    
THEY'RE ALL FOUR WOMEN OF COLOR

THEY'RE ALL FOUR WOMEN OF COLOR 
WHO VOTED AGAINST THIS BILL.    

775
00:31:37,191 --> 00:31:39,225
WHO VOTED AGAINST THIS BILL.    
AND THE REALITY, I THINK THERE'S

776
00:31:39,227 --> 00:31:40,860
AND THE REALITY, I THINK THERE'S
TROUBLE RECONCILING WITHIN THIS 

777
00:31:40,862 --> 00:31:43,329
TROUBLE RECONCILING WITHIN THIS 
COUNTRY, IF THESE WERE WHITE

00:31:43,331 --> 00:31:44,463
COUNTRY, IF THESE WERE WHITE    
BABIES BEING TREATED THIS WAY IN

THESE DETENTION FACILITIES, IF  

780
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,966
THESE DETENTION FACILITIES, IF  
THESE WERE WHITE WOMEN BEING    

781
00:31:46,968 --> 00:31:48,801
THESE WERE WHITE WOMEN BEING    
HELD IN OVERCROWDED FACILITIES, 

782
00:31:48,803 --> 00:31:51,904
HELD IN OVERCROWDED FACILITIES, 
BEING TOLD TO DRINK FROM        

783
00:31:51,906 --> 00:31:52,538
BEING TOLD TO DRINK FROM        
TOILETS, THERE CERTAINLY WOULD  

784
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:55,675
TOILETS, THERE CERTAINLY WOULD  
BE MORE OF A NATIONAL OUTCRY.   

785
00:31:55,677 --> 00:31:57,109
BE MORE OF A NATIONAL OUTCRY.   
AND I THINK THAT'S SO IMPORTANT 

786
00:31:57,111 --> 00:32:00,246
AND I THINK THAT'S SO IMPORTANT 
AND RESONATING, THEY'RE SAYING  

787
00:32:00,248 --> 00:32:01,547
AND RESONATING, THEY'RE SAYING  
WE CANNOT TRUST THIS            

788
00:32:01,549 --> 00:32:01,914
WE CANNOT TRUST THIS            
ADMINISTRATION.                 

789
00:32:01,916 --> 00:32:02,982
ADMINISTRATION.                 
AND THERE'S BEEN CONTINUAL      

790
00:32:02,984 --> 00:32:04,750
AND THERE'S BEEN CONTINUAL      
EVIDENCE OF DONALD TRUMP        

791
00:32:04,752 --> 00:32:05,551
EVIDENCE OF DONALD TRUMP        
MISUSING FUNDS.                 

792
00:32:05,553 --> 00:32:08,587
MISUSING FUNDS.                 
WE JUST SAW ON JULY 4th, AS A   

793
00:32:08,589 --> 00:32:09,989
WE JUST SAW ON JULY 4th, AS A   
CANDIDATE AND PRESIDENT HE HAS  

794
00:32:09,991 --> 00:32:10,489

795
00:32:10,491 --> 00:32:12,892
MISUSED FUNDS.                  
SO I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING   

796
00:32:12,894 --> 00:32:14,527
SO I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING   
ABOUT THESE WOMEN SAYING WHY    

797
00:32:14,529 --> 00:32:16,462
ABOUT THESE WOMEN SAYING WHY
