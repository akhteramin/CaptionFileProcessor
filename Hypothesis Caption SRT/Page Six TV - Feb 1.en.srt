        A migraine hope         

532
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,666
         To be there...         

533
00:18:06,702 --> 00:18:08,034
         for the good.          

534
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,836
        And not so good.        

535
00:18:11,373 --> 00:18:13,440
        For the mundane.        

536
00:18:13,475 --> 00:18:16,209
       The awe-inspiring.       

537
00:18:16,245 --> 00:18:18,211
       The heart racing.        

538
00:18:18,247 --> 00:18:20,213
      The heart breaking.       

539
00:18:20,249 --> 00:18:22,215
That's what life is all about...

540
00:18:22,251 --> 00:18:23,417
          showing up.           

541
00:18:23,452 --> 00:18:29,223
  Unless migraine steals your   
  chance  to say "I am here."   

542
00:18:29,258 --> 00:18:31,792
That's why, we created Aimovig..

543
00:18:31,827 --> 00:18:34,094
   A preventive treatment for   
      migraine in adults.       

544
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,063
    One dose, once a month.     

545
00:18:36,098 --> 00:18:38,565
  Aimovig is proven to reduce   
        the number  of          

546
00:18:38,601 --> 00:18:40,000
     monthly migraine days.     

547
00:18:40,102 --> 00:18:42,603
For some, that number can       
be cut in half or more.         

548
00:18:42,638 --> 00:18:45,105
  The most common side effects  
       are pain, redness,       

549
00:18:45,141 --> 00:18:47,741
  or swelling at the injection  
     site and constipation.     

550
00:18:48,277 --> 00:18:50,377
      These are your days       

551
00:18:50,413 --> 00:18:52,379
   What will each one bring?    

552
00:18:52,415 --> 00:18:53,013
        Doesn't matter,         

553
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:54,815
   as long as you can say...    

554
00:18:54,851 --> 00:18:57,051
          "I am here."          

555
00:18:57,086 --> 00:18:59,153
   Talk to your doctor about    
      preventing migraine       

556
00:18:59,188 --> 00:19:01,422
         with Aimovig.          
       And be there more.       

557
00:19:17,172 --> 00:19:19,907
  I switched to stimulant-free  
  MiraLAX for my constipation.  

558
00:19:19,943 --> 00:19:21,909
            <i> Stimulant laxatives</i>
          <i> forcefully stimulate </i>

559
00:19:21,945 --> 00:19:22,944
                  <i> the nerves in</i>
                    <i> your colon.</i>

560
00:19:22,979 --> 00:19:23,945
                     <i> MiraLAX is</i>
                     <i> different.</i>

561
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,746
                  <i> It works with</i>
                      <i> the water</i>

562
00:19:24,781 --> 00:19:25,546
                  <i> in your body</i> 
                    <i> to unblock</i> 

563
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:26,481
                   <i> your system</i> 
                    <i> naturally.</i> 

564
00:19:26,516 --> 00:19:28,783
      And it doesn't cause      
      harsh side effects.       

565
00:19:28,818 --> 00:19:30,551
  That's why I choose MiraLAX.  

566
