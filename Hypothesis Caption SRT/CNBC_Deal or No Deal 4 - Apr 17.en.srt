   You're making me nervous--   

666

00:26:57,984 --> 00:27:00,651
            Oh, yes.

681
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:08,626
     - Yeah, I'll hang here.    

682
00:27:08,628 --> 00:27:11,061
   I mean, he's doing so well,  
   I just don't wanna jinx it.  

683
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:13,530
    - I'm a little choked up,   
            honestly.           

684
00:27:13,532 --> 00:27:14,865
      You're Emmitt Smith.      

685
00:27:14,867 --> 00:27:16,734
   You were my childhood idol.  

686
00:27:16,736 --> 00:27:19,703
    Cowboys have been my team   
     ever since I was a kid,    

687
00:27:19,705 --> 00:27:20,904
       and you're the man.      

688
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:22,606
          - Thank you.          
  - I'm so stoked you're here.  

689
00:27:22,608 --> 00:27:23,607
          - Thank you.          

690
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:24,742
    Now let me just say this    
             to you.            

691
00:27:24,744 --> 00:27:26,577
          Oftentimes--          
     oftentimes as athletes,    

692
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:29,546
     we get chosen as heroes    
        of other people.        

693
00:27:29,548 --> 00:27:31,348
 But the reality of the fact is,

694
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,217
  we are out there entertaining 
             people             

695
00:27:33,219 --> 00:27:35,152
     and inspiring people to    
    their level of greatness.

      In clinical trials,

 It does not prevent pregnancy.

contain hormones.               

1063
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:35,912
  ORILISSA may cause suicidal   
  thoughts or actions.          

1064
00:43:35,964 --> 00:43:38,798
  It may also cause bone loss.  

1065
