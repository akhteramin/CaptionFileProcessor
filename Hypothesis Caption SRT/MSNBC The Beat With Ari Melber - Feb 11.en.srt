1292

    Do your asthma symptoms     
      ever hold you back?       

1298
00:38:00,762 --> 00:38:03,146
    About 50% of people with    
         severe asthma          

1299
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:05,849
   have too many cells called   
  eosinophils in their lungs.   

1300
00:38:05,901 --> 00:38:08,601
     Eosinophils are a key      
    cause of severe asthma.     

1301
00:38:08,636 --> 00:38:12,489
 FASENRA is desned to tget      
    and remove these cells.     

1302
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:14,941
     FASENRA is an add-on       
    injection for people 12

00:38:14,976 --> 00:38:17,444

     driven by sinophils.       

1304
00:38:17,479 --> 00:38:18,995
    FASENRA is not a rescue

    eosinophilic conditions.    

1306
00:38:21,533 --> 00:38:24,817
   FASENRA is proven to help    
 prevent severe asthma attacks, 

1307
00:38:24,836 --> 00:38:27,837
   improve breathing, and can   
    lower oral steroid use.     

1308
00:38:27,873 --> 00:38:30,507
       FASENRA may cause

   Ask an asthma specialist     
         about FASENRA.         

1318

00:45:07,272 --> 00:45:09,822
