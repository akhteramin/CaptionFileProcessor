00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:43,940
 I switched to Verizon because  

347
00:13:43,976 --> 00:13:46,276
          I was tired           
  of having my calls dropped.   

348
00:13:46,311 --> 00:13:47,844
    I had friends that were     
           next to me           

349
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:49,746
    and they weren't having     
   these issues and they said   

350
00:13:49,781 --> 00:13:50,980
  like, "You need to switch!"   

351
00:13:51,016 --> 00:13:52,949
       And then I'd heard       
  that I could get Apple Music  

352
00:13:52,984 --> 00:13:55,385
       if I switched over       
      and I said, "BOOM!"       

353
