 if ORILISSA is right for you.  

597

    ORILISSA is specifically

      In clinical trials,       

600

ORILISSA was proven to reduce 3 
common types of

Don't use ORILISSA if you are or

  cyclosporine or gemfibrozil.  

609
00:23:36,203 --> 00:23:38,037
     It may cause abnormal      
     liver tests.               

610
00:23:38,105 --> 00:23:40,305
    ORILISSA may change your    
    periods, making it hard     

611
00:23:40,374 --> 00:23:41,874
  to know if you are pregnant.  

612
00:23:41,942 --> 00:23:43,309
 It does not prevent pregnancy. 

613
00:23:43,377 --> 00:23:45,878
Use birth control that does not 
contain hormones.               

614
00:23:45,947 --> 00:23:48,480
  ORILISSA may cause suicidal   
  thoughts or actions.          

615
00:23:48,549 --> 00:23:51,350
  It may also cause bone loss.  

616

   Ask your gynecologist if     
   ORILISSA is right for you.

    coverage day or night.      

624
00:24:07,602 --> 00:24:08,768
    Because better coverage     

625
00:24:08,836 --> 00:24:10,269
    means better protection.
