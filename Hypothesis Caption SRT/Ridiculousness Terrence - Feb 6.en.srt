      [cheers and applause]     

686
00:27:54,347 --> 00:27:56,747
         Okay, Terrence,        
    do you collect sneakers?    

687
00:27:56,816 --> 00:27:58,282
          - Yes, I do.          
          - Where does          

688
00:27:58,351 --> 00:28:00,885
 the sneaker passion come from, 
 and how many pairs do you own? 

689
00:28:00,953 --> 00:28:03,420
         - Oh, if I get,        
        like, a new pair,       

690
00:28:03,489 --> 00:28:04,555
      I'll try to give away     
          an old pair,          

691
00:28:04,624 --> 00:28:06,423
        so I don't really       
    keep up with the number.    

692
00:28:06,492 --> 00:28:07,992
 But I love, like, old sneakers.

693
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,994
          Like, this is         
      a pair of Yeezy 1's.      

694
00:28:10,062 --> 00:28:11,762
             - Damn.            
      - This pair, I've had     

695
00:28:11,831 --> 00:28:12,997
       for over ten years.      

696
00:28:13,065 --> 00:28:14,665
 Because I couldn't afford them 
           growing up.          

697
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:16,467
      So as soon as I got,      
          like, on TV,          

698
00:28:16,536 --> 00:28:18,736
  it was like, always something 
  really special for me to get. 

699
00:28:18,805 --> 00:28:20,671
         Like, you know?        
          - I feel you.         

700
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,940
    - All-all these sneakers    
      that I couldn't get.      

701
00:28:23,009 --> 00:28:25,009
            - Shoes are amazing,
                  but sometimes,

702
00:28:25,077 --> 00:28:27,011
      they're really funny      
      when you take a slam      

703
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:28,746
     and they go sailing off    
          into nowhere.         

704
00:28:28,815 --> 00:28:30,314
          - Yes, it is.         
      - Just like everybody
