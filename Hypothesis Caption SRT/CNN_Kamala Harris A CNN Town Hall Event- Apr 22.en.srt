LEADERS.                        
HERE'S WHAT I WOULD DO          

265
00:07:58,464 --> 00:07:58,962
HERE'S WHAT I WOULD DO          
SPECIFICALLY.

SPECIFICALLY.                   
I DO SUPPORT DEBT FREE COLLEGE. 

267
00:08:00,799 --> 00:08:02,399
I DO SUPPORT DEBT FREE COLLEGE. 
I ALSO BELIEVE THAT WHAT WE NEED

268
00:08:02,401 --> 00:08:03,867
I ALSO BELIEVE THAT WHAT WE NEED
TO DO IS WE NEED TO ALLOW       

269
00:08:03,869 --> 00:08:05,602
TO DO IS WE NEED TO ALLOW       
STUDENTS TO REFINANCE YOUR      

270
00:08:05,604 --> 00:08:07,004
STUDENTS TO REFINANCE YOUR      
STUDENT LOAN DEBT AND IN        

271
00:08:07,006 --> 00:08:10,541

PARTICULAR I'M SUPPORTING AN    

272
00:08:10,543 --> 00:08:11,441
PARTICULAR I'M SUPPORTING AN    
INITIATIVE THAT WOULD ALLOW YOU 

273
00:08:11,443 --> 00:08:14,244
INITIATIVE THAT WOULD ALLOW YOU 
TO REFINANCE YOUR STUDENT LOAN  

274
00:08:14,246 --> 00:08:15,312
TO REFINANCE YOUR STUDENT LOAN  
DEBTING TO BE ON PAR WITH       

275
00:08:15,314 --> 00:08:16,280
DEBTING TO BE ON PAR WITH       
FEDERAL LENDING AMOUNTS.        

276
00:08:16,282 --> 00:08:17,714
FEDERAL LENDING AMOUNTS.        
FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU -- PROBABLY 

277
00:08:17,716 --> 00:08:20,384
FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU -- PROBABLY 
NONE OF YOU HERE, BUT ANY OF    

278
00:08:20,386 --> 00:08:22,753
NONE OF YOU HERE, BUT ANY OF    
YOUR OLDER BROTHERS AND SISTERS 

279
00:08:22,755 --> 00:08:23,654
YOUR OLDER BROTHERS AND SISTERS 
IF YOU TOOK OUT STUDENT LOANS   

280
00:08:23,656 --> 00:08:24,888
IF YOU TOOK OUT STUDENT LOANS   
BETWEEN 2006 AND 2013, THE      

281
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:27,024
BETWEEN 2006 AND 2013, THE      
INTEREST RATE WAS ABOUT 7%.     

282
00:08:27,026 --> 00:08:28,559
INTEREST RATE WAS ABOUT 7%.     
WHAT I AM PROPOSING IS          

283
00:08:28,561 --> 00:08:29,426
WHAT I AM PROPOSING IS          
REGARDLESS OF THE INTEREST RATE 

284
00:08:29,428 --> 00:08:30,394
REGARDLESS OF THE INTEREST RATE 
AT THE TIME THAT YOU TOOK OUT   

285
00:08:30,396 --> 00:08:32,896
AT THE TIME THAT YOU TOOK OUT   
OUR STUDENT LOANS, THAT UPON    

286
00:08:32,898 --> 00:08:35,199
OUR STUDENT LOANS, THAT UPON    
REPAYMENT IT WOULD HAVE TO BE AT

287
00:08:35,201 --> 00:08:35,466
REPAYMENT IT WOULD HAVE TO BE AT
3.5%.                           

288
00:08:35,468 --> 00:08:37,601
3.5%.                           
THE OTHER THING IS THIS.        

289
00:08:37,603 --> 00:08:39,269
THE OTHER THING IS THIS.        
PART OF THE ISSUE IS THAT TERMS 

290
00:08:39,271 --> 00:08:41,672
PART OF THE ISSUE IS THAT TERMS 
OF REPAYMENT THERE IS NO        

291
00:08:41,674 --> 00:08:44,775
OF REPAYMENT THERE IS NO        
CONNECTION BETWEEN WHAT YOU OWE 

292
00:08:44,777 --> 00:08:45,142
CONNECTION BETWEEN WHAT YOU OWE 
AND YOUR INCOME.                

293
00:08:45,144 --> 00:08:46,243
AND YOUR INCOME.                
WHAT I WOULD BE REQUIRING IS    

294
00:08:46,245 --> 00:08:48,445
WHAT I WOULD BE REQUIRING IS    
THAT THERE BE A ROBUST PROCESS  

295
00:08:48,447 --> 00:08:50,948
THAT THERE BE A ROBUST PROCESS  
BY WHICH INCOME-BASED REPAYMENT 

296
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,583
BY WHICH INCOME-BASED REPAYMENT 
WOULD BE THE NORM.              

297
00:08:52,585 --> 00:08:53,951
WOULD BE THE NORM.              
AND FINALLY LET'S LOOK AT THE   

298
00:08:53,953 --> 00:08:56,320
AND FINALLY LET'S LOOK AT THE   
FACT THAT FOR ALL OF YOU AND ALL

299
00:08:56,322 --> 00:08:58,789
FACT THAT FOR ALL OF YOU AND ALL
OF ANYBODY WHO HAS APPLIED FOR  

300
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:01,158
OF ANYBODY WHO HAS APPLIED FOR  
FINANCIAL AID THAT IS AN AWFUL  

301
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:01,392
FINANCIAL AID THAT IS AN AWFUL  
PROCESS.                        

302
00:09:01,394 --> 00:09:02,893
PROCESS.                        
YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING  

303
00:09:02,895 --> 00:09:03,093
YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING  
ABOUT.                          

304
00:09:03,095 --> 00:09:03,827
ABOUT.                          
ALL THOSE PAGES.

YOU CAN'T BARELY GET THROUGH    
THAT FORM.                      

307
00:09:09,902 --> 00:09:12,136
THAT FORM.                      
AND SO PART OF WHAT WE NEED TO  

308
00:09:12,138 --> 00:09:13,404
AND SO PART OF WHAT WE NEED TO  
DO IS SIMPLIFY THAT PROCESS.    

309
00:09:13,406 --> 00:09:15,406
DO IS SIMPLIFY THAT PROCESS.    
BUT WE HAVE GOT TO DO A BETTER  

310
00:09:15,408 --> 00:09:16,307
BUT WE HAVE GOT TO DO A BETTER  
JOB IN THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE, YOU
