NOW THERE IS A MOVEMENT I THINK 
FOR CORRECTLY TO REQUIRE A

of the best musicians came from.

4751
07:02:04,818 --> 07:02:04,819
         When you talked

4752

      who lived down there

   on Jourdan Avenue down here  

4757

       in the Ninth Ward.

     at 1939 Jourdan Avenue.    

4759
07:02:04,834 --> 07:02:04,835

4761
07:02:04,838 --> 07:02:04,839
       I went to a school       
   right down the street here.  

4762
07:02:04,840 --> 07:02:04,841
     It was about 10 blocks     
   from here, McCartey School.  

4763
07:02:04,842 --> 07:02:04,843
    And then I remember years   
       ago when I used --       

4764
07:02:04,844 --> 07:02:04,845
 used to come home from school. 

4765
07:02:04,846 --> 07:02:04,847
 My mom used to be cooking, um, 
        on a wood stove.        

4766
07:02:04,848 --> 07:02:04,849
         And sometimes I        
      got from school, uh,      

4767
07:02:04,850 --> 07:02:04,851
      and I had to cut wood     
          that evening.         

4768
07:02:04,852 --> 07:02:04,853
    Another thing I remember    
 when I lived on Jourdan Avenue,

4769
07:02:04,854 --> 07:02:04,855
 I used to pick iron and copper 
 in the street, Jourdan Avenue, 

4770
07:02:04,856 --> 07:02:04,857
       I used to live on.       

4771
07:02:04,858 --> 07:02:04,859
     The street was so bad,     
      the holes were so big     

4772
07:02:04,860 --> 07:02:04,861
     they used to get stuff     
   from the cotton bale and --  

4773
07:02:04,862 --> 07:02:04,863
   and and fill the street up   
 with nothin' but tin and iron. 

4774
07:02:04,864 --> 07:02:04,865
     That -- that's the way     
       Jourdan Avenue was.      

4775
07:02:04,866 --> 07:02:04,867
      And I used to sell it     
      to -- sell the scrap.     

4776
07:02:04,868 --> 07:02:04,869
    If you made your 20 cents   
      or 25 cents livin'...     

4777
07:02:04,870 --> 07:02:04,871
    That was a lot of money,    
     25 cents, in that time.    

4778
07:02:04,872 --> 07:02:04,873
        -When he got out        
       and about, he was,       

4779
07:02:04,874 --> 07:02:04,875
     uh, roamin' the streets    
       of the Ninth Ward.       

4780
07:02:04,876 --> 07:02:04,877
  And he would love to pick up  
      things that he'd see.     

4781
07:02:04,878 --> 07:02:04,879
   And sometimes he'd sell 'em  
       to the junkman who,      

4782
07:02:04,880 --> 07:02:04,881
         uh, ironically,        

4783

blacks heard music in those days

    belonged to Fats Domino.    

5270
07:02:05,856 --> 07:02:05,857
    With nine records scoring   
          in the top-10         

5271
07:02:06,305 --> 07:02:10,541

   there was no stopping him.   

5272
07:02:10,609 --> 07:02:12,242
        And in that year,       

5273
07:02:12,311 --> 07:02:14,078
 he recorded the song for which 

5274
07:02:14,146 --> 07:02:16,246

5277

   -COLEMAN: "Blueberry Hill"   
       was a pop standard       

5278
07:02:28,027 --> 07:02:30,661
    that had originally been    
        recorded in 1940        

5279
07:02:30,730 --> 07:02:34,298
          by Gene Autry         
   for a singin' cowboy movie.  

5280
07:02:34,366 --> 07:02:36,767
But the most significant version
            for Fats            

5281
07:02:36,836 --> 07:02:42,573
was the Louis Armstrong version.

5282
07:02:42,641 --> 07:02:45,275
    It was a phenomenal time    
            for him.            

5283
07:02:45,344 --> 07:02:48,746
  The unfortunate thing is that 
  Lew Chudd of Imperial Records 

5284
07:02:48,814 --> 07:02:54,084
 actually tried too hard to sell
Fats Domino to a white audience.

5285
07:02:54,153 --> 07:02:57,888
   He thought that if you made  
       it sound more pop,       

5286
07:02:57,957 --> 07:03:00,491
    it would sell more white.   

5287
07:03:00,559 --> 07:03:03,427
 But he kind of missed the point
         of Fats Domino.        

5288
07:03:03,496 --> 07:03:06,396
 And so he was having him record
      all these standards.      

5289
07:03:06,465 --> 07:03:08,332
    Some worked, some didn't.   

5290
07:03:08,400 --> 07:03:10,567
   As "Blueberry Hill" proved,  

5291
07:03:10,636 --> 07:03:12,569
         when Fats redid        
           a standard,          

5292
07:03:12,638 --> 07:03:14,538
    he changed it all around    
          so the people         

5293
07:03:14,607 --> 07:03:17,641

          at his shows,         

5509
07:14:47,565 --> 07:14:49,065
  partly because of integration 

5510
07:14:49,133 --> 07:14:53,469
   but also the fact that they  
   had alcohol at these shows.  

5511
07:14:53,538 --> 07:14:57,807
   So they were mixing alcohol  
          plus dancing          

5512
07:14:57,875 --> 07:15:00,409
     plus the races together    
       for the first time       

5513
07:15:00,478 --> 07:15:02,011
    in a lot of these places.   

5514
07:15:02,080 --> 07:15:03,713
       And it was leading       
       to a little fights       

5515
07:15:03,781 --> 07:15:05,848
       which soon bloomed       
        into huge fights.       

5516
07:15:05,917 --> 07:15:08,050
   And they called the police.

    -HARDESTY: We got caught    
          in two riots.

07:15:09,754 --> 07:15:13,155

    it wasn't a racial thing.   

5519
07:15:13,224 --> 07:15:15,191
       There was a fight.       

5520
07:15:15,259 --> 07:15:17,326
  And with -- within the fight, 

5521
07:15:17,395 --> 07:15:21,363
   the police decided to throw  
      tear gas in the hall.     

5522
07:15:21,432 --> 07:15:23,632
      And everybody panic.      

5523
07:15:23,701 --> 07:15:25,468
       Well, it turned out      
        not to be a riot,       

5524
07:15:25,536 --> 07:15:27,103
        but people tryin'

07:15:27,171 --> 07:15:30,439

   and there was a race riot,

      exposure right there.

All the news media picked it up.

     So that was publicity.     

5531
07:15:42,320 --> 07:15:44,954
          But there...

  to go up 100 mile out the way 

5552
07:16:26,164 --> 07:16:28,230
    to get a place to sleep.    

5553
07:16:28,299 --> 07:16:32,334
   -It was tough. We stayed in  
   little, small-like hotels.   

5554
07:16:32,403 --> 07:16:37,439
  We didn't have the privilege  
   and the -- the restaurants.  

5555
07:16:37,508 --> 07:16:41,043
   I started drivin' the bus.   

5556
07:16:41,112 --> 07:16:43,012
         And I would go         
     into these restaurants

5559
07:16:48,686 --> 07:16:50,786
       And when the hotels      
  first integrated, that was -- 

5560
07:16:50,855 --> 07:16:52,354
  I was the first ones in them. 

5561

  no doubt about the fact that,

          uh, the Negro         
   is more determined now than

     ever before to be free.    

5564
07:17:02,099 --> 07:17:05,935
      I think that there is     
          a discontent          

5565
07:17:06,003 --> 07:17:09,538
     in the Negro community,    
a frustration and an impatience,

            Just slice it,      
            maybe pound it      
            a little for me.    

5746
07:28:34,991 --> 07:28:36,924
All right, terrific.            
All right, so let me            

5747
07:28:36,926 --> 07:28:39,026
get this sliced up              
and pounded.                    

5748
07:28:39,028 --> 07:28:41,963
    Jonas: There just aren't    
    places like this anymore,   

5749
07:28:41,965 --> 07:28:46,134
 where you have a local butcher,
       a local meat store.      

5750
07:28:46,136 --> 07:28:47,735
    This is like Paris.         

5751
07:28:47,737 --> 07:28:50,771
          This is like          
    the Italian countryside.    

5752
07:28:50,773 --> 07:28:53,374
There's a little bit of it      
 right here in Georgetown.      

5753
07:28:53,376 --> 07:28:56,043
    There's a nice feeling      
         to the place.          

5754
07:28:57,881 --> 07:28:59,881
Narrator: Stop by at lunch      
for one of the market's         

5755
07:28:59,883 --> 07:29:02,650
    signature sandwiches,       
    like the hot pastrami       

5756
07:29:02,652 --> 07:29:04,152
    or 4-meat grinder.          

5757
07:29:04,154 --> 07:29:07,155
    Just don't plan on          
finishing it anytime soon.      

5758
07:29:07,157 --> 07:29:09,824
 Man: Oh, no. You really can't  
 eat the grinder in one sitting.

5759
07:29:09,826 --> 07:29:13,828
    And if you can, make him    
 president of the United States.

5760
07:29:13,830 --> 07:29:15,830
    I was surprised             
    when I received it,         

5761
07:29:15,832 --> 07:29:19,600
     because I literally        
could eat this all week long.   

5762
07:29:19,602 --> 07:29:21,769
        So we had to            
        have it cut in 4s       

5763
07:29:21,771 --> 07:29:25,339
    just for me to be able      
    to take a bite.             

5764
07:29:25,341 --> 07:29:28,409
    Stachowski: You travel to   
     the Polish neighborhood    
         where I'm from,        

5765
07:29:28,411 --> 07:29:30,411
sandwiches were meals to us,    

5766
07:29:30,413 --> 07:29:33,447
    so they tended to be        
    on the big side.            

5767
07:29:33,449 --> 07:29:35,516
Look, we are in Georgetown,     

5768
07:29:35,518 --> 07:29:38,185
but we're tucked up away        
in the Rose Park neighborhood.  

5769
07:29:38,187 --> 07:29:40,221
    So we gotta stand out,      

5770
07:29:40,223 --> 07:29:41,989
    and our sandwiches          
    let us do that.             

5771
07:29:41,991 --> 07:29:44,592
        Now we've gotten        
    the reputation for that.    

5772
07:29:45,895 --> 07:29:47,995
     Narrator: And if your      
    appetite isn't so big,      

5773
07:29:47,997 --> 07:29:52,166
there are still a few items     
    on the menu that might be   
        just the ticket.        

5774
07:29:52,168 --> 07:29:54,101
Sometimes if you don't          
feel like you can handle        

5775
07:29:54,103 --> 07:29:58,339
3 days' worth of sandwich,      
might just need a salad!

       - You try to pull        
     the technical defense.     

6533
10:28:26,235 --> 10:28:27,334
    "I was at my apartment,     
      I don't live there."

            (woman)             
             - No.              

6535
10:28:28,704 --> 10:28:30,838
 - You could easily have said,  
    "I co-hosted the party,     

6536
10:28:30,906 --> 10:28:32,139
   and I told the police that   
   and that's why I'm here."    

6537
10:28:33,676 --> 10:28:35,476
So, baby, you had to bring your 
  mother to court today, huh?   

6538
10:28:35,544 --> 10:28:36,577
            - I did.            

6539
10:28:36,646 --> 10:28:37,778
        - Are you still         
   spoon-feeding him or not?    

6540
10:28:39,248 --> 10:28:41,215
Did you know that you could not 
   park there with a placard?   

6541
10:28:41,283 --> 10:28:42,983
        - I only parked         
       there 30 seconds.        

6542
10:28:43,052 --> 10:28:45,653
  - You were there 30 seconds?  
     - 30-45 seconds, ah...     

6543
10:28:45,721 --> 10:28:46,654
      - You keep talking,       
         they're gonna          

6544
10:28:46,722 --> 10:28:47,655
           take your            
     handicap placard away.     

6545
10:28:49,258 --> 10:28:51,859
          (announcer)           
    - This is the courtroom     
     of Judge Frank Caprio,     

6546
10:28:51,927 --> 10:28:54,595
     where people and cases     
    are met with compassion.    

6547
10:28:54,664 --> 10:28:56,597
   A different kind of judge.   

6548
10:28:56,666 --> 10:28:58,499
          A courtroom           
         like no other.         

6549
10:28:58,567 --> 10:29:00,167
This is "Caught in Providence." 

6550
10:29:01,671 --> 10:29:02,636
         (Judge Caprio)         
       - Nicholas Damon.        

6551
10:29:04,373 --> 10:29:06,006
  - Good morning, Your Honor.   

6552
10:29:06,075 --> 10:29:07,241
         (Judge Caprio)         
       - Okay, Mr. Damon,       

6553
10:29:07,309 --> 10:29:09,476
      you're charged with       
   going through a red light    

6554
10:29:09,545 --> 10:29:12,880
    on Roger Williams Avenue    
       and Elmwood Avenue       

6555
10:29:12,948 --> 10:29:15,316
    at 10:18 in the morning.    

6556
10:29:16,485 --> 10:29:17,818
          Is this your          
        lawyer with you?        

6557
10:29:17,887 --> 10:29:19,687
      - This is my mother.      
         - I'm his mom.         

6558
10:29:22,325 --> 10:29:24,258
   - When are you gonna stop    
   taking care of these kids?   

6559
10:29:24,327 --> 10:29:26,493
        - I don't know.         

6560
10:29:26,562 --> 10:29:28,729
    - How long does it take     
    before you cut the cord?    

6561
10:29:28,798 --> 10:29:29,730
            - Never.            

6562
10:29:29,799 --> 10:29:30,831
         (Judge Caprio)         
            - Never.            

6563
10:29:30,900 --> 10:29:32,566
            - Never.            
    - That's a good answer.     

6564
10:29:32,635 --> 10:29:34,401
            - Now...            

6565
10:29:34,470 --> 10:29:36,503
    this is a classic case,     
        Inspector Quinn,        

6566
10:29:36,572 --> 10:29:38,572
       of a mother coming       
  to court for her little boy.  

6567
10:29:38,641 --> 10:29:40,007
     - Yup, it's her baby.      

6568
10:29:40,076 --> 10:29:41,175
         She's here for         
           her baby.            

6569
10:29:41,243 --> 10:29:42,242
         (Judge Caprio)         
   - She's here for her baby.   

6570
10:29:42,311 --> 10:29:44,111
     "I have to go to court     
         for my baby."          

6571
10:29:44,180 --> 10:29:45,379
        Do you have any         
       younger than him?        

6572
10:29:45,448 --> 10:29:47,314
           - No, no.            
       - No, only child.        

6573
10:29:47,383 --> 10:29:48,482
         (Judge Caprio)         
      - So he's your baby.      

6574
10:29:48,551 --> 10:29:50,684
     - He's my baby, yeah,      
       he's my only one.        

6575
10:29:50,753 --> 10:29:53,020
  - So, baby, you had to bring  
your mother to court today, huh?

6576
10:29:53,089 --> 10:29:54,355
        - I did, I did.         

6577
10:29:54,423 --> 10:29:55,356
    (Judge Caprio chuckling)    

6578
10:29:55,424 --> 10:29:56,790
      Hopefully it helps.       

6579
10:29:56,859 --> 10:29:58,258
 - Are you still spoon-feeding  
          him or not?           

6580
10:29:58,327 --> 10:29:59,259
             - No.              

6581
10:29:59,328 --> 10:30:00,260
         (Judge Caprio)         
             - No?              

6582
10:30:01,330 --> 10:30:02,863
         Well, he's...          

6583
10:30:02,932 --> 10:30:04,198
       he's charged with        
   going through a red light.   

6584
10:30:04,266 --> 10:30:05,599
    We're gonna look at it.     

6585
10:30:05,668 --> 10:30:06,934
            - Good.             

6586
10:30:07,003 --> 10:30:08,769
      - What is your name?      
            - Kerri.            

6587
10:30:08,838 --> 10:30:10,070
            - Kerri.            
            - Damon.            

6588
10:30:10,139 --> 10:30:11,438
            - Damon.            

6589
10:30:11,507 --> 10:30:12,439
      Well, come up here.       

6590
10:30:14,410 --> 10:30:16,176
         Come up here,          
         come up here.          

6591
10:30:19,081 --> 10:30:20,381
      - You know, it's not      
    gonna end well for you,     

6592
10:30:20,449 --> 10:30:22,082
   so get rid of that smile.    

6593
10:30:22,151 --> 10:30:23,717
        - Get over here.        
            - Okay.             

6594
10:30:23,786 --> 10:30:25,085
        - We're gonna--         
  you've gotta give me a hand   

6595
10:30:25,154 --> 10:30:26,787
  on deciding this case, okay?  

6596
10:30:26,856 --> 10:30:28,188
       - Okay, all right.       
   - You've gotta be honest.    

6597
10:30:28,257 --> 10:30:30,124
   - I will be honest, yeah.    
          - All right.          

6598
10:30:30,192 --> 10:30:32,426
     - No special leniency.     
     - No special leniency.     

6599
10:30:32,495 --> 10:30:34,461
  - All right, so, okay, so--   
     - He hasn't had any...     

6600
10:30:34,530 --> 10:30:36,597
          - All right,          
  so I'm gonna get over here,   

6601
10:30:36,666 --> 10:30:37,865
        you're gonna get        
           over here,           

6602
10:30:37,933 --> 10:30:40,567
      and we're gonna look      
    at the video right here.    

6603
10:30:40,636 --> 10:30:42,469
     Okay, Lisa, let's go.      

6604
10:30:42,538 --> 10:30:43,637
       The light is red.        

6605
10:30:47,276 --> 10:30:48,876
             And...             

6606
10:30:48,945 --> 10:30:51,178
    - Uh... I thought it was    
        a right on red.         

6607
10:30:51,247 --> 10:30:52,479
         (Judge Caprio)         
    - Hold on for a minute.     

6608
10:30:52,548 --> 10:30:53,480
       The light is red.        

6609
10:30:55,051 --> 10:30:56,350
       He's coming down.        

6610
10:30:58,721 --> 10:31:00,187
          And he made           
       a right-hand turn.       

6611
10:31:00,256 --> 10:31:01,622
  Okay, now, what do you wanna  
      tell me about that?       

6612
10:31:01,691 --> 10:31:02,990
         - Well, he did         
      have his brakes on.       

6613
10:31:04,760 --> 10:31:05,859
      (attendees laughing)      

6614
10:31:05,928 --> 10:31:09,330
       And it was a slow,       
        it was a slow...        

6615
10:31:09,398 --> 10:31:12,600
     - You... you can take      
a right turn on red over there. 

6616
10:31:12,668 --> 10:31:13,901
      It does have a sign       
          that says--           

6617
10:31:13,970 --> 10:31:14,902
 - I'm talking to your mother.  

6618
10:31:14,971 --> 10:31:16,503
    - All right, all right,     
             sorry.             

6619
10:31:16,572 --> 10:31:18,005
         - Be careful.          

6620
10:31:18,074 --> 10:31:19,707
        - I guess it was        
        a rolling stop.         

6621
10:31:19,775 --> 10:31:22,409
    - It was a rolling stop.    

6622
10:31:22,478 --> 10:31:24,245
           You don't            
       think he stopped.        

6623
10:31:24,313 --> 10:31:25,713
            (Kerri)             
            - Um...             

6624
10:31:25,781 --> 10:31:27,514
         No, he didn't          
      stop completely, no.      

6625
10:31:29,518 --> 10:31:31,051
     - You agree with that,     
        Inspector Quinn?        

6626
10:31:31,120 --> 10:31:33,153
      - She took the words      
 right out of my mouth, Judge.  

6627
10:31:33,222 --> 10:31:34,655
         (Judge Caprio)         
            - Yeah?             

6628
10:31:34,724 --> 10:31:36,323
         So what do you         
  think we should do with him?  

6629
10:31:37,627 --> 10:31:38,726
            - Um...             

6630
10:31:38,794 --> 10:31:40,561
    I don't know, I've done     
      a lot to him already      

6631
10:31:40,630 --> 10:31:42,363
          and screamed          
        at him about it,        

6632
10:31:42,431 --> 10:31:43,797
       and I-- I don't--        

6633
10:31:43,866 --> 10:31:44,899
           - Did you            
          beat him up?          

6634
10:31:44,967 --> 10:31:45,900
        - I didn't beat         
            him up.             

6635
10:31:45,968 --> 10:31:47,034
       No, I couldn't...        

6636
10:31:47,103 --> 10:31:49,069
       - Wanna use this?        
      - I could use this.       

6637
10:31:49,138 --> 10:31:50,971
      (attendees laughing)      

6638
10:31:53,209 --> 10:31:54,375
          - All right.          

6639
10:31:54,443 --> 10:31:56,143
       Like every mother,       
   like every mother, right,    

6640
10:31:56,212 --> 10:31:58,646
       she sees the good        
       in her son, right?       

6641
10:31:58,714 --> 10:32:00,481
        You're still her        
          little baby.          

6642
10:32:00,550 --> 10:32:03,050
          You can make          
   a right-hand turn on red.    

6643
10:32:03,119 --> 10:32:04,752
        At this location        
        you had to stop.        

6644
10:32:04,821 --> 10:32:06,554
        Your mother says        
      your brakes were on       

6645
10:32:06,622 --> 10:32:08,155
       and that you came        
       to a rolling stop,       

6646
10:32:08,224 --> 10:32:09,857
      so the question is--      

6647
10:32:09,926 --> 10:32:12,293
          she's making          
      an impassioned plea       

6648
10:32:12,361 --> 10:32:15,229
    that you made an attempt    
            to stop             

6649
10:32:15,298 --> 10:32:16,831
            and that            
      it was a close call.      

6650
10:32:16,899 --> 10:32:17,865
        Is that what you        
          were saying?          

6651
10:32:17,934 --> 10:32:18,999
         - That's what          
       I was saying, yes.       

6652
10:32:19,068 --> 10:32:20,000
     - So how do you wanna      
           find him?            

6653
10:32:20,069 --> 10:32:21,068
     Guilty or not guilty?      

6654
10:32:21,137 --> 10:32:23,704
         - Uh, I would          
      find him not guilty.      

6655
10:32:23,773 --> 10:32:24,705
      (attendees laughing)

          I am trying           
       to learn English.        

6770
10:38:05,650 --> 10:38:08,617
   If I say something wrong,    
      I am sorry for this.      

6771
10:38:08,686 --> 10:38:09,852
        - You can't say         
      anything wrong here.      

6772
10:38:09,921 --> 10:38:10,853
           (Muammer)            
            - Okay.             

6773
10:38:10,922 --> 10:38:12,355
     - Where are you from?      
           - Turkey.            

6774
10:38:12,423 --> 10:38:13,489
           - How long           
      have you been here?       

6775
10:38:13,558 --> 10:38:15,424
     - Uh, ten months here.     

6776
10:38:15,493 --> 10:38:16,492
         - You're doing         
          pretty good.          

6777
10:38:16,561 --> 10:38:17,893
     - Thank you very much.     

6778
10:38:17,962 --> 10:38:19,462
    - Yeah, what do you do?     
       Are you a student?       

6779
10:38:19,530 --> 10:38:21,597
        - I am-- I am...        

6780
10:38:21,666 --> 10:38:25,501
   studying in-- I am student   
      in Brown University,      

6781
10:38:25,570 --> 10:38:27,904
   and I am working in labs.    

6782
10:38:27,972 --> 10:38:30,139
          And today...          

6783
10:38:30,208 --> 10:38:31,374
          first time,           

6784
10:38:31,442 --> 10:38:35,511
         I park my car          
            in 3:00             

6785
10:38:35,580 --> 10:38:39,082
           and after            
      one and half hour...      

6786
10:38:39,150 --> 10:38:40,716
           when I...            

6787
10:38:40,785 --> 10:38:42,752
          when I come           
        to near my car,         

6788
10:38:42,821 --> 10:38:45,555
      I found a violation       
         parking ticket         

6789
10:38:45,623 --> 10:38:49,492
      and there is no sign      
   about the no parking here    

6790
10:38:49,561 --> 10:38:51,394
    because this is not own.    

6791
10:38:51,463 --> 10:38:55,531
        I just-- I want         
 to just study in lab two hours 

6792
10:38:55,600 --> 10:38:56,833
             but...             

6793
10:38:56,901 --> 10:38:59,435
      and there is no sign      
        about no parking        

6794
10:38:59,504 --> 10:39:00,937
    or no overnight parking.    

6795
10:39:01,006 --> 10:39:02,071
            - Okay.             

6796
10:39:02,140 --> 10:39:05,208
       Have you ever been       
     in a court in Turkey?      

6797
10:39:05,277 --> 10:39:07,277
     - No, first time here.     

6798
10:39:07,345 --> 10:39:08,278
         (Judge Caprio)         
     - First time in court?     

6799
10:39:08,346 --> 10:39:09,813
          - First time          
          in my life,           

6800
10:39:09,881 --> 10:39:12,482
   and I am excited about it.   

6801
10:39:12,551 --> 10:39:15,018
  - Well, we hope we give you   
     a favorable impression     

6802
10:39:15,087 --> 10:39:17,487
      of the United States      
        judicial system.        

6803
10:39:17,556 --> 10:39:19,022
        All right, so...        

6804
10:39:19,091 --> 10:39:22,425
     let me explain to you      
  what the situation is, okay?  

6805
10:39:22,494 --> 10:39:25,595
      Everything you said       
          is accurate.          

6806
10:39:25,664 --> 10:39:27,163
      Everything you said.      

6807
10:39:27,232 --> 10:39:28,631
       There are no signs       
            that say            

6808
10:39:28,700 --> 10:39:31,434
           you cannot           
   park overnight, all right?   

6809
10:39:31,503 --> 10:39:34,604
    And, plus, to complicate    
         matters more,          

6810
10:39:34,673 --> 10:39:35,672
     there's a sign saying      

6811
10:39:35,741 --> 10:39:38,475
      you can park during       
         certain hours,         

6812
10:39:38,543 --> 10:39:41,378
    and you were not parked     
  during those certain hours,   

6813
10:39:41,446 --> 10:39:44,014
       so, in your mind,        
       "I can park here."       

6814
10:39:44,082 --> 10:39:45,749
    Which makes sense to me.    

6815
10:39:45,817 --> 10:39:48,785
      Except that the city      
            has a...            

6816
10:39:48,854 --> 10:39:50,153
      a set of ordinances.      

6817
10:39:55,761 --> 10:39:57,928
    These are the city laws.    

6818
10:39:57,996 --> 10:40:00,864
      And in here it says       
   you cannot park overnight    

6819
10:40:00,933 --> 10:40:02,466
         in Providence.         

6820
10:40:02,534 --> 10:40:04,568
      So, before you came       
          from Turkey,          

6821
10:40:04,636 --> 10:40:06,303
       you were supposed        
       to read this book.       

6822
10:40:06,372 --> 10:40:07,938
      - Read all of that?       

6823
10:40:08,007 --> 10:40:10,741
       I have just two--        
        two months here.        

6824
10:40:10,809 --> 10:40:12,576
    (Judge Caprio chuckling)    

6825
10:40:12,645 --> 10:40:14,611
            - So...             

6826
10:40:14,680 --> 10:40:16,546
          it's a very           
        confusing thing.        

6827
10:40:16,615 --> 10:40:18,549
      People in Providence      
        know they can't,        

6828
10:40:18,617 --> 10:40:20,651
       but I don't think        
        it's fair for us        

6829
10:40:20,719 --> 10:40:22,352
         to charge you          
     for parking overnight,     

6830
10:40:22,421 --> 10:40:23,620
       when, number one,        
        you didn't know,        

6831
10:40:23,689 --> 10:40:25,856
          number two,           
 the sign was very misleading.  

6832
10:40:25,925 --> 10:40:27,891
  So that's the short version   
           of saying            

6833
10:40:27,960 --> 10:40:30,194
    that you won your case.     

6834
10:40:30,262 --> 10:40:31,995
          So when you           
      get back to Turkey,       

6835
10:40:32,064 --> 10:40:34,198
     you can say, "I was in     
       the United States,       

6836
10:40:34,266 --> 10:40:36,300
        "and I received         
   a summons to go to court,    

6837
10:40:36,368 --> 10:40:39,002
    and I fought the system     
          and I won."           

6838
10:40:39,071 --> 10:40:40,738
        - Am I won now?         

6839
10:40:40,806 --> 10:40:41,739
         (Judge Caprio)         
           - You win.           

6840
10:40:41,807 --> 10:40:43,540
        - Oh, thank you         
           very much.           

6841
10:40:43,609 --> 10:40:45,609
    (Judge Caprio chuckling)    

6842
10:40:45,678 --> 10:40:46,944
           Thank you.           

6843
10:40:47,013 --> 10:40:48,512
      - Good luck to you,       
    the matter is dismissed.    

6844
10:40:48,581 --> 10:40:50,314
      You did a-- you did       
        a wonderful job.        

6845
10:40:50,383 --> 10:40:51,615
     - Thank you very much.     

6846
10:40:51,684 --> 10:40:52,716
        Thank you again.        

6847
10:40:54,353 --> 10:40:56,420
     - As many of you know,     
      videos of our cases       

6848
10:40:56,489 --> 10:40:58,489
       have been watched        
    nearly two billion times    

6849
10:40:58,558 --> 10:41:00,357
   on social media platforms    

6850
10:41:00,426 --> 10:41:02,560
        such as YouTube         
         and Facebook.          

6851
10:41:02,628 --> 10:41:05,830
    Over half of these views    
  come from foreign countries.  

6852
10:41:05,898 --> 10:41:07,798
       Almost universally       

6853
10:41:07,867 --> 10:41:09,433
      the viewers comment       
        that they wished        

6854
10:41:09,502 --> 10:41:11,602
     the court proceedings      
       in their countries       

6855
10:41:11,671 --> 10:41:14,739
          were as fair          
 as the ones in our courtroom.  

6856
10:41:14,807 --> 10:41:16,407
   While not always perfect,    

6857
10:41:16,476 --> 10:41:18,209
       the United States        
        judicial system         

6858
10:41:18,277 --> 10:41:19,944
    is based on the premise     

6859
10:41:20,013 --> 10:41:23,214
   that everyone is innocent    
      until proven guilty.      

6860
10:41:23,283 --> 10:41:25,149
           That's not           
      the case everywhere.      

6861
10:41:25,218 --> 10:41:27,685
    I'm pleased that we were    
      able to demonstrate       

6862
10:41:27,754 --> 10:41:30,688
     that concept in person     
          to Mr. Tukar          

6863
10:41:30,757 --> 10:41:32,490
          in the hope           
         that he enjoys         

6864
10:41:32,559 --> 10:41:34,625
      the rest of his stay      
     in our great country.      

6865
10:41:36,863 --> 10:41:37,895
        Juliana Roland.         

6866
10:41:39,399 --> 10:41:40,364
  - Good morning, Your Honor.   

6867
10:41:40,433 --> 10:41:41,432
         (Judge Caprio)         
    - Good morning, Juliana.    

6868
10:41:41,501 --> 10:41:42,600
       Juliana, you have        
       a speeding ticket        

6869
10:41:42,669 --> 10:41:44,969
     on Chalkstone Avenue,      
       in a school zone.        

6870
10:41:45,038 --> 10:41:46,471
             - Yes.             

6871
10:41:46,539 --> 10:41:47,505
         (Judge Caprio)         
      - Is there anything       
    you wanna tell me about?    

6872
10:41:47,574 --> 10:41:48,639
       - Yes, Your Honor.       

6873
10:41:48,708 --> 10:41:49,841
         I'm here from          
        South Carolina.         

6874
10:41:49,909 --> 10:41:51,509
  I reside in South Carolina.   

6875
10:41:51,578 --> 10:41:52,543
        - In Lexington.         

6876
10:41:52,612 --> 10:41:53,678
           (Juliana)            
       - And-- I'm sorry.       

6877
10:41:53,747 --> 10:41:54,912
- In Lexington, South Carolina. 

6878
10:41:54,981 --> 10:41:56,414
        - No, actually,         
       I'm in Blythewood.       

6879
10:41:56,483 --> 10:41:57,415
         (Judge Caprio)         
             - Oh--             

6880
10:41:57,484 --> 10:41:58,449
   - It was a rental vehicle.   

6881
10:41:58,518 --> 10:41:59,651
             - Oh.              

6882
10:41:59,719 --> 10:42:01,819
         - I have been          
out of the state of Rhode Island

6883
10:42:01,888 --> 10:42:03,821
          since 1994,           

6884
10:42:03,890 --> 10:42:05,623
         and I was back         
       visiting my dad--        

6885
10:42:05,692 --> 10:42:06,658
         88 years old.          

6886
10:42:06,726 --> 10:42:08,193
        He was entering         
     hospice that weekend.      

6887
10:42:08,261 --> 10:42:10,462
           And so...            

6888
10:42:10,530 --> 10:42:11,463
       I'm familiar with        
           the area.            

6889
10:42:11,531 --> 10:42:12,764
   I lived on Pembroke Avenue   

6890
10:42:12,833 --> 10:42:16,301
    just, you know, north of    
Nathanael Greene Middle School. 

6891
10:42:16,369 --> 10:42:17,569
  I'm familiar with the area.   

6892
10:42:17,637 --> 10:42:21,006
   I was staying at a rental    
     property in Providence     

6893
10:42:21,074 --> 10:42:23,642
    and just picked up speed    
     going down that hill.      

6894
10:42:23,710 --> 10:42:25,410
      Didn't see the sign       
      for the school zone.      

6895
10:42:25,479 --> 10:42:27,545
 I know Nathanael Greene School 
           is there.            

6896
10:42:27,614 --> 10:42:30,916
   I've had one speed ticket    
   in my driving life, 1991,    

6897
10:42:30,984 --> 10:42:32,717
 on the New York State Thruway. 

6898
10:42:32,786 --> 10:42:35,053
      I had that dismissed      
  because I was a safe driver.  

6899
10:42:35,122 --> 10:42:36,488
        I just taught my        
     16-year-old to drive.      

6900
10:42:36,557 --> 10:42:38,590
  She was licensed last week.   

6901
10:42:38,659 --> 10:42:41,960
  So, I'm asking forgiveness,   
        if not leniency         

6902
10:42:42,029 --> 10:42:43,395
        for this because        
      I am a safe driver,       

6903
10:42:43,464 --> 10:42:46,098
      and... I'm certainly      
     guilty of the charge,      

6904
10:42:46,166 --> 10:42:48,133
           but, um...           

6905
10:42:48,202 --> 10:42:51,436
  - Well, you're one mile over  
what I would charge ordinarily. 

6906
10:42:51,505 --> 10:42:53,538
           I have...            

6907
10:42:53,607 --> 10:42:55,007
        I have an issue,        
         not a problem.         

6908
10:42:55,075 --> 10:42:56,508
  I have an issue with that--   

6909
10:42:56,577 --> 10:43:00,279
          the location          
 of that particular mechanism,  

6910
10:43:00,347 --> 10:43:02,548
   because Chalkstone Avenue    
    is a hill going down...     

6911
10:43:02,616 --> 10:43:04,049
         - Yes, it is,          
          yes, it is.           

6912
10:43:04,118 --> 10:43:05,717
   - ... into Raymond Street,   

6913
10:43:05,786 --> 10:43:07,286
        and that's where        
    they've got the machine.    

6914
10:43:07,354 --> 10:43:08,520
     So you actually would      
           have to be           

6915
10:43:08,589 --> 10:43:11,290
       pumping the brakes       
      going down the hill       

6916
10:43:11,358 --> 10:43:12,958
         to be going...         

6917
10:43:13,027 --> 10:43:14,159
         to keep within         
        the speed limit,        

6918
10:43:14,228 --> 10:43:15,761
     and you were one over      
     what I usually charge,     

6919
10:43:15,830 --> 10:43:17,096
     so I'm gonna give you      
            a break.            

6920
10:43:17,164 --> 10:43:19,164
          - Thank you,          
     thank you, Your Honor.     

6921
10:43:19,233 --> 10:43:20,632
    - Is it your dad that's     
      going into hospice?       

6922
10:43:20,701 --> 10:43:22,267
   - He passed on June 12th,    

6923
10:43:22,336 --> 10:43:24,136
             so...              

6924
10:43:24,205 --> 10:43:26,105
      last time I saw him       
  but it was good to be here.   

6925
10:43:26,173 --> 10:43:27,573
         But nice gift.         

6926
10:43:27,642 --> 10:43:28,807
 But thank you for dismissing,  
          Your Honor.           

6927
10:43:28,876 --> 10:43:29,808
        I appreciate it.        

6928
10:43:29,877 --> 10:43:30,910
          - In memory           
          of your dad.          

6929
10:43:30,978 --> 10:43:32,645
    - Thank you, thank you--    
          thanks, Dad.          

6930
10:43:32,713 --> 10:43:33,913
          - Good luck.          

6931
10:43:35,216 --> 10:43:36,148
        You actually had        
     a pretty good morning.     

6932
10:43:36,217 --> 10:43:37,149
         You know that.         

6933
10:43:37,218 --> 10:43:38,250
  - Both tickets were not me,   

6934
10:43:38,319 --> 10:43:39,285
       and I have to pay        
    somebody else's mistake.    

6935
10:43:39,353 --> 10:43:40,886
      Yeah, it's a pretty       
         great morning.         

6936
10:43:40,955 --> 10:43:42,455
         (Judge Caprio)         
   - I think you better leave   
    before I change my mind.    

6937
10:44:01,009 --> 10:44:02,842
 Around here, nobody ever does  
 it.                            

6938
10:44:02,911 --> 10:44:03,843
        I Didn't do it.         

6939
10:44:03,912 --> 10:44:05,344
So when I heard they added Ultra
Oxi                             

6940
10:44:05,413 --> 10:44:07,647
 to the cleaning power of Tide, 
 it was just what we needed.    

6941
10:44:07,715 --> 10:44:08,648
              Dad?              

6942
10:44:08,716 --> 10:44:09,949
        I didn't do it.         

6943
10:44:10,018 --> 10:44:13,252
 <i> #1 stain and odor fighter, #1</i>

6945
10:45:02,003 --> 10:45:04,604
      Stand up to Chronic       
     Migraine with BOTOX®.      

6946
10:45:05,974 --> 10:45:08,675
What if you had fewer headaches 
     and migraines a month?     

6947
10:45:09,611 --> 10:45:11,745
        BOTOX® prevents         
    headaches and migraines     

6948
10:45:11,814 --> 10:45:13,013
    before they even start.     

6949
10:45:13,549 --> 10:45:15,682
      BOTOX® is for adults      
     with Chronic Migraine,     

6950
10:45:15,751 --> 10:45:17,417
      15 or more headache       
         days a month,          

6951
10:45:17,486 --> 10:45:19,186
 each lasting 4 hours or more.  

6952
10:45:19,989 --> 10:45:22,856
  BOTOX® injections take about  
15 mins. in your doctor's office

6953
10:45:22,925 --> 10:45:24,958
        and are covered         
       by most insurance.       

6954
10:45:25,294 --> 10:45:26,593
  Effects of BOTOX® may spread  

6955
10:45:26,662 --> 10:45:28,095
 hours to weeks after injection 

6956
10:45:28,164 --> 10:45:29,129
   causing serious symptoms.    

6957
10:45:30,599 --> 10:45:31,832
 Alert your doctor right away,  
   as difficulty swallowing,    

6958
10:45:31,901 --> 10:45:33,667
      speaking, breathing,      
         eye problems,          

6959
10:45:33,736 --> 10:45:34,968
       or muscle weakness       

6960
10:45:35,037 --> 10:45:36,203
       can be signs of a        
  life-threatening condition.   

6961
10:45:36,439 --> 10:45:38,405
        Side effects may        
  include allergic reactions,   

6962
10:45:38,474 --> 10:45:41,208
 neck and injection site pain,  
     fatigue, and headache.     

6963
10:45:41,277 --> 10:45:43,277
    Don't receive BOTOX® if     
   there's a skin infection.    

6964
10:45:43,479 --> 10:45:45,446
     Tell your doctor your      
   medical history, muscle or   

6965
10:45:45,515 --> 10:45:47,047
       nerve conditions,        
        and medications,        

6966
10:45:47,116 --> 10:45:48,516
  including botulinum toxins,   

6967
10:45:48,584 --> 10:45:50,985
   as these may increase the    
 risk of serious side effects.  

6968
10:45:51,053 --> 10:45:52,686
With the BOTOX® Savings Program,

6980
10:46:22,252 --> 10:46:24,852

       a noise violation        

6981
10:46:24,921 --> 10:46:27,889
   where there was loud music   
     coming from your house     

6982
10:46:27,958 --> 10:46:29,324
    at 2:30 in the morning.     

6983
10:46:29,392 --> 10:46:30,525
            - Yeah.             

6984
10:46:30,594 --> 10:46:31,626
         (Judge Caprio)         
  - Where you having a party?   

6985
10:46:31,695 --> 10:46:32,694
  - Yeah, but this actually--   

6986
10:46:32,762 --> 10:46:33,995
     - What kind of a party     
            was it?             

6987
10:46:34,064 --> 10:46:36,631
         - This wasn't          
       actually my house,       

6988
10:46:36,700 --> 10:46:39,501
      so they kind of gave      
     it to me by accident.      

6989
10:46:39,569 --> 10:46:40,735
   They thought I lived there   

6990
10:46:40,804 --> 10:46:42,670
         because it was         
       my friend's house,       

6991
10:46:42,739 --> 10:46:46,041
  and I was there at the party  
      with everybody else,      

6992
10:46:46,109 --> 10:46:47,742
        but they assumed        
         I lived there,         

6993
10:46:47,811 --> 10:46:49,744
   so they gave me the fine.    

6994
10:46:49,813 --> 10:46:51,713
        The officer had         
          told me that          

6995
10:46:51,782 --> 10:46:54,282
        I could possibly        
  fight it or get it dismissed  

6996
10:46:54,351 --> 10:46:56,451
   since I am not a resident    
         at the house.          

6997
10:46:56,520 --> 10:46:57,552
     - So you were a guest.     

6998
10:46:57,621 --> 10:46:59,154
            - Yeah.             

6999
10:46:59,223 --> 10:47:01,189
         - According to         
       the police report,       

7000
10:47:01,258 --> 10:47:02,324
    the police spoke to you     

7001
10:47:02,392 --> 10:47:04,393
       and you said that        
        you were hosting        

7002
10:47:04,461 --> 10:47:05,727
    the welcome-back party.     

7003
10:47:05,796 --> 10:47:06,728
         Is that right?         

7004
10:47:06,797 --> 10:47:07,729
             - No.              

7005
10:47:07,798 --> 10:47:09,965
        Actually, I was         
      co-hosting with him,      

7006
10:47:10,034 --> 10:47:11,800
     so, yes, I was helping     

7007
10:47:11,869 --> 10:47:14,002
        and I was, like,        
      a part of it, but--       

7008
10:47:14,071 --> 10:47:17,172
  - So you were the organizer?  
     - No-- well, it was--      

7009
10:47:17,241 --> 10:47:18,173
     - You were hosting it,     
    you were the organizer.     

7010
10:47:18,242 --> 10:47:19,341
            - Yeah.             

7011
10:47:19,410 --> 10:47:20,909
      But, I mean, I guess      
      I really was the one      

7012
10:47:20,978 --> 10:47:22,544
    who took a fall for it.     

7013
10:47:22,613 --> 10:47:23,812
            - Yeah.             

7014
10:47:23,881 --> 10:47:26,215
So, according to your admission,
       it was your party.       

7015
10:47:28,152 --> 10:47:29,318
      - I mean... I guess.      

7016
10:47:29,387 --> 10:47:30,953
      - You just told me,       
       you co-hosted it.        

7017
10:47:31,022 --> 10:47:33,656
     - Yeah, but it wasn't      
           just mine.           

7018
10:47:33,724 --> 10:47:35,591
          - Was, uh...          

7019
10:47:35,660 --> 10:47:37,493
   Martin-- was Martin Severs   
             also--             

7020
10:47:37,561 --> 10:47:39,261
  - Yeah, he also got fined...  

7021
10:47:39,330 --> 10:47:40,362
         (Judge Caprio)         
       - He got one too.        

7022
10:47:40,431 --> 10:47:41,931
       - ... but his was        
           dismissed.           

7023
10:47:41,999 --> 10:47:42,965
     - Well, I'm not sure.      

7024
10:47:43,034 --> 10:47:43,966
      I didn't dismiss it.      

7025
10:47:44,035 --> 10:47:45,968
        - Yeah, I know,         
        I'm just saying.        

7026
10:47:46,037 --> 10:47:47,403
  - Inspector Quinn, you wanna  
       be heard on this?        

7027
10:47:47,472 --> 10:47:49,739
         - Your Honor,          
      based on the, uh...       

7028
10:47:49,807 --> 10:47:52,274
 the statements in the report,  
             um...              

7029
10:47:52,343 --> 10:47:53,542
        - Well, she was         
     a little disingenuous      

7030
10:47:53,611 --> 10:47:55,645
   when she first-- when she    
        first came out.         

7031
10:47:55,713 --> 10:47:57,280
  If you had just been honest   

7032
10:47:57,348 --> 10:47:58,581
    when you first came out     
           and said--           

7033
10:47:58,650 --> 10:48:01,384
       you know, you try        
 to pull the technical defense. 

7034
10:48:01,452 --> 10:48:03,319
 "Well, I was at my apartment,  
      I don't live there."      

7035
10:48:03,388 --> 10:48:04,620
             (Aga)              
             - No.              

7036
10:48:04,689 --> 10:48:06,689
 - You could have easily said,  
    "I co-hosted the party,     

7037
10:48:06,758 --> 10:48:08,491
     and I told the police      
 that and that's why I'm here." 

7038
10:48:08,560 --> 10:48:10,026
     - I mean, I was just--     

7039
10:48:10,095 --> 10:48:11,627
     - I know what you were     
         trying to do.          

7040
10:48:11,696 --> 10:48:13,363
             (Aga)              
      - Trying to say what      
       they had told me,        

7041
10:48:13,431 --> 10:48:14,731
     'cause they said that.     

7042
10:48:14,799 --> 10:48:16,232
          - I get it.           

7043
10:48:16,301 --> 10:48:17,367
        Inspector Quinn?        

7044
10:48:17,435 --> 10:48:19,302
         - Your Honor,          
      based on the report,      

7045
10:48:19,371 --> 10:48:20,436
        it would be $100        

7046
10:48:20,505 --> 10:48:22,305
        or she can have         
            a trial.            

7047
10:48:22,374 --> 10:48:24,040
       - You would've got       
   a much better disposition    

7048
10:48:24,109 --> 10:48:25,575
     if you had been honest     
      from the beginning.       

7049
10:48:25,644 --> 10:48:27,577
        Inspector Quinn         
     made a recommendation.     

7050
10:48:27,646 --> 10:48:29,546
     $100 fine or come back     
       and have a trial.        

7051
10:48:32,317 --> 10:48:33,450
         - I mean, I...         

7052
10:48:33,518 --> 10:48:34,851
    - The matter's set down     
           for trial.           

7053
10:48:37,990 --> 10:48:38,922
           Good luck.           

7054
10:48:40,325 --> 10:48:43,493
    If you wanna be trusted,    
      you must be honest.       

7055
10:48:43,562 --> 10:48:45,662
         If Ms. Delgado         
  had simply told me the truth  

7056
10:48:45,731 --> 10:48:47,631
  about her role in the party,  

7057
10:48:47,699 --> 10:48:50,267
   I would have been inclined   
    to dismiss the charges.     

7058
10:48:50,335 --> 10:48:52,102
  Thomas Jefferson once said,   

7059
10:48:52,171 --> 10:48:55,238
 "Honesty is the first chapter  
    in the book of wisdom."     

7060
10:48:55,307 --> 10:48:57,007
   It's also the best policy    

7061
10:48:57,076 --> 10:48:59,009
      for every situation       
            in life.            

7062
10:48:59,078 --> 10:49:01,912
         Including how          
  you behave in the courtroom.  

7063
10:49:03,249 --> 10:49:05,349
               ♪♪               

7064
10:49:05,417 --> 10:49:06,383
         Tony Acevedo.          

7065
10:49:08,787 --> 10:49:11,655
         Tony, you have         
      three registrations.      

7066
10:49:11,724 --> 10:49:13,157
             - Hmm?             

7067
10:49:13,225 --> 10:49:14,792
         (Judge Caprio)         
      - Do you understand       
       what I just said?        

7068
10:49:14,860 --> 10:49:15,826
     - Three registrations?     

7069
10:49:15,895 --> 10:49:16,860
             - Yes.             

7070
10:49:16,929 --> 10:49:17,961
       Now, who's Maria--       

7071
10:49:18,030 --> 10:49:18,963
      - That's my mother,       
              sir.              

7072
10:49:19,031 --> 10:49:19,964
         (Judge Caprio)         
         - Valenzuela.          

7073
10:49:20,032 --> 10:49:20,965
     Are you here for her?      

7074
10:49:21,033 --> 10:49:22,232
          - Yes, sir.           

7075
10:49:22,301 --> 10:49:24,101
      - All right, she has      
  an overnight parking ticket   

7076
10:49:24,170 --> 10:49:26,003
          on Althea...          

7077
10:49:26,072 --> 10:49:28,105
          - Yes, sir.           

7078
10:49:28,174 --> 10:49:29,740
    - There's a $40 penalty.    

7079
10:49:29,809 --> 10:49:30,975
            I waived            
          the penalty.          

7080
10:49:31,043 --> 10:49:32,009
          - Thank you.          

7081
10:49:32,078 --> 10:49:33,144
         (Judge Caprio)         
    - So you just saved $40.    

7082
10:49:33,212 --> 10:49:34,278
    You got the first ticket    
           dismissed.           

7083
10:49:35,882 --> 10:49:36,881
    Now comes the bad news.     

7084
10:49:38,885 --> 10:49:40,318
          You have two          
     red-light violations.      

7085
10:49:43,189 --> 10:49:45,223
         One goes back          
          to last year          

7086
10:49:45,291 --> 10:49:47,458
         and one is...          

7087
10:49:47,527 --> 10:49:49,227
      just two weeks ago.       

7088
10:49:51,030 --> 10:49:53,398
        This is a ticket        
    on North Main and Branch    

7089
10:49:53,466 --> 10:49:54,899
    at 7:38 in the evening.     

7090
10:49:56,369 --> 10:49:57,568
    What's the time on that?    

7091
10:49:57,637 --> 10:49:58,836
             (man)              
       - .4, Your Honor.        

7092
10:49:58,905 --> 10:49:59,837
         (Judge Caprio)         
          - All right.          

7093
10:49:59,906 --> 10:50:01,506
       The next one is...       

7094
10:50:01,574 --> 10:50:03,274
       on Pleasant Valley       
       and Valley Street.       

7095
10:50:07,747 --> 10:50:08,813
       Is that him making       
       a right-hand turn?       

7096
10:50:08,882 --> 10:50:09,814
             (man)              
       - Yes, Your Honor.       

7097
10:50:09,883 --> 10:50:11,449
     That's no turn on red      
            at all.             

7098
10:50:11,518 --> 10:50:12,550
         (Judge Caprio)         
       - Was this during        

7099
10:50:12,619 --> 10:50:14,252
  the period of construction?   

7100
10:50:14,321 --> 10:50:15,520
             (man)              
       - Yes, Your Honor.       

7101
10:50:15,589 --> 10:50:18,556
  - I'm gonna find-- I'm gonna  
      dismiss that ticket       

7102
10:50:18,625 --> 10:50:20,425
where the signs were confusing, 

7103
10:50:20,494 --> 10:50:23,428
         and it will be         
       $85 on the other.        

7104
10:50:23,497 --> 10:50:25,664
     This is gonna cost you     
        a total of $105.        

7105
10:50:27,668 --> 10:50:28,667
        You actually had        
     a pretty good morning.     

7106
10:50:28,735 --> 10:50:30,335
         You know that.         

7107
10:50:30,404 --> 10:50:31,736
            - Yeah.             

7108
10:50:31,805 --> 10:50:34,873
 Yeah, compared to that both--  
   both tickets were not me,    

7109
10:50:34,942 --> 10:50:36,208
       and I have to pay        
    somebody else's mistake.

         -Ha. [ Sighs ]         

7229
10:56:16,956 --> 10:56:19,624
   -"Box, have a great summer.  
           Danielle."           

7230
10:56:19,626 --> 10:56:21,793
              Ooh.              
   Danielle, control yourself.  

7231
10:56:21,795 --> 10:56:23,061
  I'd like to slow it down here 

7232
10:56:23,063 --> 10:56:26,965
     with a special discount    
       for a special girl.      

7233
10:56:26,967 --> 10:56:28,600
  Danielle, this one's for you. 

7234
10:56:29,769 --> 10:56:31,302
e a photographecial discount    
       for a special girl.      
      that shows this car       

7235
10:56:31,371 --> 10:56:32,604
        was parked right        
       in front of a sign       

7236
10:56:32,672 --> 10:56:34,305
      that says "tow zone,      
          no parking."          

7237
10:56:34,374 --> 10:56:35,573
   - He didn't see the sign?    

7238
10:56:35,642 --> 10:56:37,041
         (Judge Caprio)         
   - He didn't see the sign?    

7239
10:56:37,177 --> 10:56:39,144
 I'm gonna send him-- I'm gonna 
      send him for an exam      

7240
10:56:39,212 --> 10:56:40,412
       to check his eyes.       

7241
10:56:40,480 --> 10:56:41,646
       The sign is right        
      in front of the car.      

7242
10:56:41,715 --> 10:56:43,314
  According to the photograph   
            I have,             

7243
10:56:43,383 --> 10:56:44,749
        he couldn't open        
      the door of his car       

7244
10:56:44,818 --> 10:56:45,817
         unless he saw          
           the sign.            

7245
10:56:45,886 --> 10:56:46,818
      (attendees laughing)      

7246
10:56:47,888 --> 10:56:48,820
             (man)              
       - Are you kidding?       

7247
10:58:25,721 --> 10:58:26,886
         (Judge Caprio)         
     - Here's your vehicle,     
      here's your vehicle,      

7248
10:58:26,955 --> 10:58:28,121
    here's vehicle and-- oh.    

7249
10:58:28,190 --> 10:58:29,356
     Do you still think you     
      stopped long enough?      

7250
10:58:29,424 --> 10:58:30,190
             - Yes.             

7251
10:58:31,426 --> 10:58:32,659
           Maybe not.           

7252
10:58:32,728 --> 10:58:33,760
         - Waive them.          

7253
10:58:33,829 --> 10:58:35,395
   - Why should I waive this    
        for your nephew         

7254
10:58:35,464 --> 10:58:36,430
          when you're           
       telling me that--        

7255
10:58:36,498 --> 10:58:37,998
     - Because he's nowhere     
          to be found.          

7256
10:58:38,067 --> 10:58:40,534
      - You're telling me       
  he's totally irresponsible.   

7257
10:58:40,602 --> 10:58:42,803
  On behalf of all the people   
         of Providence,         

7258
10:58:42,871 --> 10:58:54,623
         thank you for          
      paying your summons.      

7259
10:58:54,624 --> 10:59:06,376
   - Your record hasn't been    
      that good, you know?      

7260
10:59:06,377 --> 10:59:18,129
           - I know.            
       - But you changed.       

7261
10:59:18,130 --> 10:59:29,882
         - The warm-up,         
    you have this guy here.     

7262
10:59:29,883 --> 10:59:41,635
   - Hey, you trying to take    
       my brother's job?        
          - Nah, nah.           

7263
10:59:41,636 --> 10:59:53,388
       Why don't you get        
       a haircut though?        

7264
10:59:53,389 --> 11:00:05,141
           (laughter)           

7265
11:00:05,142 --> 11:00:16,894
   - I don't have the means.    
     I only have 75¢ on me.     

7266
11:00:16,895 --> 11:00:28,647
          (announcer)           
     This is the courtroom      
     of Judge Frank Caprio,     

7267
11:00:28,648 --> 11:00:40,400
     where people and cases     
    are met with compassion.    

7268
11:00:40,401 --> 11:00:52,153
   A different kind of judge.   

7269
11:00:52,154 --> 11:01:03,906
          A courtroom           
         like no other.         

7270
11:01:03,907 --> 11:01:15,659
This is "Caught in Providence." 

7271
11:01:15,660 --> 11:01:27,412
     - Bertrand Brousseau.      

7272
11:01:27,413 --> 11:01:39,165
     - Morning, Your Honor.     
        - Morning, sir.         

7273
11:01:39,166 --> 11:01:50,918
         Mr. Brousseau,         
        you have a, uh,         

7274
11:01:50,919 --> 11:02:02,671
      expired meter ticket      
        on Angel Street.        

7275
11:02:02,672 --> 11:02:14,424
   - I paid that three times.   
          - (laughing)          

7276
11:02:14,425 --> 11:02:26,177
  - Three times, and number--   

7277
11:02:26,178 --> 11:02:37,930
      Let me just give you      
    a little quick rundown.     

7278
11:02:37,931 --> 11:02:49,683
          - All right.          
      - My daughter works       

7279
11:02:49,684 --> 11:03:01,436
    on top of the bookstore     
       on Thayer Street.        

7280
11:03:01,437 --> 11:03:13,189
         - Yeah, okay.          
   - All right, third floor.    

7281
11:03:13,190 --> 11:03:24,942
    Her office is up there.     

7282
11:03:24,943 --> 11:03:36,695
     It was the day before      
         her birthday.          

7283
11:03:36,696 --> 11:03:48,448
         I went to drop         
     something off to her.      

7284
11:03:48,449 --> 11:04:00,201
       I-- She was busy.        
          I know that.          

7285
11:04:00,202 --> 11:04:11,954
   So I just dropped it off.    
      Took me 30 seconds.       

7286
11:04:11,955 --> 11:04:23,707
     30 seconds to get down     
   the stairs, up the stairs.   

7287
11:04:23,708 --> 11:04:35,460
       But anyways, um--        

7288
11:04:35,461 --> 11:04:47,213
      - You sure it wasn't      
          15 seconds?           

7289
11:04:47,214 --> 11:04:58,966
 - I-- It was closer than that. 
        I'm handicapped.        

7290
11:04:58,967 --> 11:05:10,719
       But, uh, anyways,        
           the, uh...           

7291
11:05:10,720 --> 11:05:22,472
     the meter had expired.     

7292
11:05:22,473 --> 11:05:34,225
  And I had put eight quarters  
      in the stupid thing       

7293
11:05:34,226 --> 11:05:45,978
          and it still          
      didn't go anywhere.       

7294
11:05:45,979 --> 11:05:57,731
     I put a sign on it...      
        "broken meter."         

7295
11:05:57,732 --> 11:06:09,484
  The lady tagged me anyways.   

7296
11:06:09,485 --> 11:06:21,237
     I went and found her.      

7297
11:06:21,238 --> 11:06:32,990
 I was probably in that office  
          15 minutes.           

7298
11:06:32,991 --> 11:06:44,743
  I said, you know, what is--   
          so, anyways.          

7299
11:06:44,744 --> 11:06:56,496
    But they were chasing me    
 and I kept paying 25, 25, 25.  

7300
11:06:56,497 --> 11:07:08,249
    It never got caught up.     
     I gave 'em 50 already.     

7301
11:07:08,250 --> 11:07:20,002
         - (chuckling)          
          - I think--           

7302
11:07:20,003 --> 11:07:31,755
   No, I think I gave 'em 75.   

7303
11:07:31,756 --> 11:07:43,508
     - Thought you gave 50.     

7304
11:07:43,509 --> 11:07:55,261
  - No, some-- well, somebody.  

7305
11:07:55,262 --> 11:08:07,014
       - No, don't fight        
         with a judge.          

7306
11:08:07,015 --> 11:08:18,767
 - All right, whatever you say. 
     Anyways, Your Honor--      

7307
11:08:18,768 --> 11:08:30,520
- All right, well, let me tell--
           (laughing)           

7308
11:08:30,521 --> 11:08:42,273
 Let me tell you what happened. 

7309
11:08:42,274 --> 11:08:54,026
   You got the ticket, right?   

7310
11:08:54,027 --> 11:09:05,779
            - Yeah.             

7311
11:09:05,780 --> 11:09:17,532
       - And you paid it.       

7312
11:09:17,533 --> 11:09:29,285
            - Yeah.             

7313
11:09:29,286 --> 11:09:41,038
    - But when you paid it,     

7314
11:09:41,039 --> 11:09:52,791
      14 days had expired.      

7315
11:09:52,792 --> 11:10:04,544
         Listen to me.          
            14 days.            

7316
11:10:04,545 --> 11:10:16,297
     They give you 14 days      
       to pay the ticket.       

7317
11:10:16,298 --> 11:10:28,050
            - Okay.             
     - If you don't pay it      
    in 14 days, it doubles.     

7318
11:10:28,051 --> 11:10:39,803
      So what happened was      
       the ticket doubled       

7319
11:10:39,804 --> 11:10:51,556
    'cause you didn't pay it    
          in 14 days,           

7320
11:10:51,557 --> 11:11:03,309
        so you paid $25.        

7321
11:11:03,310 --> 11:11:15,062
            - Right.            
            - Right?            

7322
11:11:15,063 --> 11:11:26,815
       Then they sent you       
        a notice saying,        

7323
11:11:26,816 --> 11:11:38,568
     "You owe us another 25     
'cause you paid that one late." 

7324
11:11:38,569 --> 11:11:50,321
      Then you didn't pay       
       that one for 14--        

7325
11:11:50,322 --> 11:12:02,074
    Then you waited 14 days     
     and you paid that one.     

7326
11:12:02,075 --> 11:12:13,827
      So they took that 25      
and they sent you another notice

7327
11:12:13,828 --> 11:12:25,580
       saying, "You paid        
         the second 25,         

7328
11:12:25,581 --> 11:12:37,333
      but you didn't do it      
        within 14 days."        

7329
11:12:37,334 --> 11:12:49,086
       - It's worse than        
        Bank of America,        

7330
11:12:49,087 --> 11:13:00,839
     you know what I mean?      

7331
11:13:00,840 --> 11:13:12,592
     - You're gonna pay 25      
   for the rest of your life    

7332
11:13:12,593 --> 11:13:24,345
        every two weeks.        
       - Right, exactly.        

7333
11:13:24,346 --> 11:13:36,098
  - All right, I'm gonna dis--  
 I'm gonna dismiss the balance. 

7334
11:13:36,099 --> 11:13:47,851
          - All right.          
        - Not only that,        
  I'm gonna give you a credit.  

7335
11:13:47,852 --> 11:13:59,604
  I'm gonna give you a credit   
for the extra 25 that you paid. 

7336
11:13:59,605 --> 11:14:11,357
          - All right.          
       - Because you have       
     a red light violation.     

7337
11:14:11,358 --> 11:14:23,110
        - There you go.         

7338
11:14:23,111 --> 11:14:34,863
 - This is on Smith and River.  
            - Right.            

7339
11:14:34,864 --> 11:14:46,616
     - Do you wanna tell me     
      anything about that?      

7340
11:14:46,617 --> 11:14:58,369
   - Yeah, I'm gonna tell you   
          about that.           

7341
11:14:58,370 --> 11:15:10,122
           (laughter)           

7342
11:15:10,123 --> 11:15:21,875
       I was on my way--        
  - It's your daughter again.   

7343
11:15:21,876 --> 11:15:33,628
          I can tell.           
         - No, listen.          

7344
11:15:33,629 --> 11:15:45,381
    I was on my way to, uh,     
      say a prayer for you      

7345
11:15:45,382 --> 11:15:57,134
       and for everybody,       
      to Saint Jude Novena      

7346
11:15:57,135 --> 11:16:08,887
            up on...            
    on, uh, Chatham Street.     

7347
11:16:08,888 --> 11:16:20,640
      - You prayed for me?      
       - Yeah, of course.       

7348
11:16:20,641 --> 11:16:32,393
      And, uh... anyways.       

7349
11:16:32,394 --> 11:16:44,146
    The, uh-- I had bad news    
        from my doctor.         

7350
11:16:44,147 --> 11:16:55,899
   - If he's praying for me,    
      he's gotta go back,       
       do a little more.        

7351
11:16:55,900 --> 11:17:07,652
      - Listen, I had bad,      
    bad news from my doctor.    

7352
11:17:07,653 --> 11:17:19,405
I was stopped at the red light, 
         first of all,          

7353
11:17:19,406 --> 11:17:31,158
     and I'm looking at it.     

7354
11:17:31,159 --> 11:17:42,911
       I wasn't texting.        

7355
11:17:42,912 --> 11:17:54,664
       I was just looking       
       to see what the--        

7356
11:17:54,665 --> 11:18:06,417
     what I had to pick up      
           and stuff.           

7357
11:18:06,418 --> 11:18:18,170
         And then I see         
       the light's green,       

7358
11:18:18,171 --> 11:18:29,923
      so-so I put it down,      

7359
11:18:29,924 --> 11:18:41,676
      then all the sudden       
      it turned red, boom.      

7360
11:18:41,677 --> 11:18:53,429
    52 years I wait my life     
          to see you.           

7361
11:18:53,430 --> 11:19:05,182
         - (chuckling)          
          - 52 years.           

7362
11:19:05,183 --> 11:19:16,935
      - You never had a--       
  - And I'm-- And I'm French.   

7363
11:19:16,936 --> 11:19:28,688
        - You never had         
      a moving violation?       

7364
11:19:28,689 --> 11:19:40,441
        - Never, never.         

7365
11:19:40,442 --> 11:19:52,194
     Except for that stupid     
   parking ticket over there.   

7366
11:19:52,195 --> 11:20:03,947
      I thought they were       
    gonna hang me for that.     

7367
11:20:03,948 --> 11:20:15,700
- We're gonna take a look at it,
      Mr. Brousseau, okay?      

7368
11:20:15,701 --> 11:20:27,453
       We're gonna take--       
    - Oh, no, I definitely--    

7369
11:20:27,454 --> 11:20:39,206
 I definitely went through it.  

7370
11:20:39,207 --> 11:20:50,959
      - Well, let me take       
         a look at it.          
      - Okay, if you want.      

7371
11:20:50,960 --> 11:21:02,712
         (Judge Caprio)         
      The light is yellow.      

7372
11:21:02,713 --> 11:21:14,465
           It's red.            

7373
11:21:14,466 --> 11:21:26,218
    Boy, you were speeding.     

7374
11:21:26,219 --> 11:21:37,971
        - No, I wasn't.         

7375
11:21:37,972 --> 11:21:49,724
             - Wow.             
     How fast was he going?     

7376
11:21:49,725 --> 11:22:01,477
          - (man) 34.           
             - 34?              

7377
11:22:01,478 --> 11:22:13,230
         You were doing         
       34 miles an hour.        

7378
11:22:13,231 --> 11:22:24,983
         Look at that.          

7379
11:22:24,984 --> 11:22:36,736
  - Maybe I did go through it.  

7380
11:22:36,737 --> 11:22:48,489
           (laughter)           

7381
11:22:48,490 --> 11:23:00,242
        I don't know why        
     I'm arguing with you.      

7382
11:23:00,243 --> 11:23:11,995
            Anyways.            
        - Wait a minute.        

7383
11:23:11,996 --> 11:23:23,748
      You just said to me       
     you were looking down.     

7384
11:23:23,749 --> 11:23:35,501
    - What I thought, yeah.     

7385
11:23:35,502 --> 11:23:47,254
    - You went right through    
           the light.           

7386
11:23:47,255 --> 11:23:59,007
      - Saint-- Saint Jude      
     wasn't driving, right?     

7387
11:23:59,008 --> 11:24:10,760
    - No, Saint Christopher,    
    he jumped out of the car    

7388
11:24:10,761 --> 11:24:22,513
        a long time ago.        
    - (Quinn) He jumped out?    

7389
11:24:22,514 --> 11:24:34,266
    He saw you were driving,    
         he jumped out.         

7390
11:24:34,267 --> 11:24:46,019
           (laughter)           

7391
11:24:46,020 --> 11:24:57,772
       - Inspector Quinn,       
         we have the--          

7392
11:24:57,773 --> 11:25:09,525
     we have the Saint Jude     
         defense today.         

7393
11:25:09,526 --> 11:25:21,278
      - (Bertrand) Anyway.      
      - You keep looking.       

7394
11:25:21,279 --> 11:25:33,031
        - I don't know.         

7395
11:25:33,032 --> 11:25:44,784
  Now I can't even see my car.  

7396
11:25:44,785 --> 11:25:56,537
        - Anything else         
       you wanna tell me?       

7397
11:25:56,538 --> 11:26:08,290
 - Nah, just tell me how much.  

7398
11:26:08,291 --> 11:26:20,043
           (laughter)           

7399
11:26:20,044 --> 11:26:31,796
 - All my friends are Italian.  

7400
11:26:31,797 --> 11:26:43,549
    They all grab my money.     
     You know what I mean?      

7401
11:26:43,550 --> 11:26:55,302
            - Ohh...            

7402
11:26:55,303 --> 11:27:07,055
         - (chuckling)          

7403
11:27:07,056 --> 11:27:18,808
         - Your Honor,          
    you're doing a good job.    

7404
11:27:18,809 --> 11:27:30,561
    And these-- the warm-up,    
    you have this guy here,     

7405
11:27:30,562 --> 11:27:42,314
     I don't know how come      
   he gets paid but to warm--   

7406
11:27:42,315 --> 11:27:54,067
          warm us up.           
         - (Quinn) Wow.         

7407
11:27:54,068 --> 11:28:05,820
           (Bertrand)           
       He's the warm-up.        

7408
11:28:05,821 --> 11:28:17,573
   - Now you're-- Now you're,   
      uh, buttering me up.      

7409
11:28:17,574 --> 11:28:29,326
     - Yeah, there you go.      
        I want his job.         

7410
11:28:29,327 --> 11:28:41,079
       Look at all the--        
- (Judge Caprio) Oh, yeah, now. 

7411
11:28:41,080 --> 11:28:52,832
   - Look at the electricity    
       we're paying for.        

7412
11:28:52,833 --> 11:29:04,585
           (laughter)           

7413
11:29:04,586 --> 11:29:16,338
         - Now you're--         
        It's my brother.        

7414
11:29:16,339 --> 11:29:28,091
       - Ahh, that's why.       

7415
11:29:28,092 --> 11:29:39,844
    - You're trying to take     
       my brother's job?        

7416
11:29:39,845 --> 11:29:51,597
          - Nah, nah.           
       Why don't you get        
       a haircut though?        

7417
11:29:51,598 --> 11:30:03,350
            (Quinn)             
              Ooh.              

7418
11:30:03,351 --> 11:30:15,103
           (laughter)           

7419
11:30:15,104 --> 11:30:26,856
      - You guys are tough      
   on all these other people.   

7420
11:30:26,857 --> 11:30:38,609
        Be tough on me.         
           Arrest me.           

7421
11:30:38,610 --> 11:30:50,362
- The parking ticket has been-- 
         has been paid.         

7422
11:30:50,363 --> 11:31:02,115
    I'm gonna dismiss that.     

7423
11:31:02,116 --> 11:31:13,868
            - Okay.             
          - All right.          

7424
11:31:13,869 --> 11:31:25,621
    The red light violation.    

7425
11:31:25,622 --> 11:31:37,374
      It's your first one       
          in 52 years.          

7426
11:31:37,375 --> 11:31:49,127
            - Yeah.             

7427
11:31:49,128 --> 11:32:00,880
      - You paid $25 extra      

7428
11:32:00,881 --> 11:32:12,633
         for the, uh...         
    for the parking ticket.     

7429
11:32:12,634 --> 11:32:24,386
  So here's what I'm gonna do.  

7430
11:32:24,387 --> 11:32:36,139
    I'm gonna charge you $35    
 court costs on the red light,  

7431
11:32:36,140 --> 11:32:47,892
     give you a $25 credit      
         that you paid          

7432
11:32:47,893 --> 11:32:59,645
    for the parking ticket.     

7433
11:32:59,646 --> 11:33:11,398
  So it's gonna cost you $10.   

7434
11:33:11,399 --> 11:33:23,151
     - For the whole thing?     

7435
11:33:23,152 --> 11:33:34,904
           (laughter)           

7436
11:33:34,905 --> 11:33:46,657
    And hey, give me the 10.    
     - (Quinn) Your Honor--     

7437
11:33:46,658 --> 11:33:58,410
        - Give me the 10        
      out of your pocket.       

7438
11:33:58,411 --> 11:34:10,163
     You said it'd be less      
           than that.           

7439
11:34:10,164 --> 11:34:21,916
           (laughter)           

7440
11:34:21,917 --> 11:34:33,669
          - Good luck.          
    - Thank you, Your Honor.    

7441
11:34:33,670 --> 11:34:45,422
          - (laughing)          

7442
11:34:45,423 --> 11:34:57,175
  - Even though Mr. Brousseau   
           is French            

7443
11:34:57,176 --> 11:35:08,928
      and Joe is Italian,       
 they have one thing in common. 

7444
11:35:08,929 --> 11:35:20,681
     They love to bust ba--     
    excuse me-- bust chops.     

7445
11:35:20,682 --> 11:35:32,434
      - Hey, there you go.      
        I want his job.         

7446
11:35:32,435 --> 11:35:44,187
- Now you're-- It's my brother. 
       - Ahh, that's why.       

7447
11:35:44,188 --> 11:35:55,940
      - You trying to take      
       my brother's job?        

7448
11:35:55,941 --> 11:36:07,693
          - Nah, nah.           
       Why don't you get        
       a haircut though?        

7449
11:36:07,694 --> 11:36:19,446
            (Quinn)             
              Ooh!              

7450
11:36:19,447 --> 11:36:31,199
     - When's the last time     
     you had a brain scan?      

7451
11:36:31,200 --> 11:36:42,952
 Kid looks like a movie star--  

7452
11:36:42,953 --> 11:36:54,705
      one that gets killed      
       in the first act.        

7453
11:36:54,706 --> 11:37:06,458
 - They are definitely brothers 
      from another mother.      

7454
11:37:06,459 --> 11:37:18,211
Mr. Brousseau, I have known Joe 
       for over 20 years,       

7455
11:37:18,212 --> 11:37:29,964
and trust me, it will take more 
  than a prayer to Saint Jude   

7456
11:37:29,965 --> 11:37:41,717
 to get the 10 bucks from him.  

7457
11:37:41,718 --> 11:37:53,470
    It will take a miracle.     

7458
11:37:53,471 --> 11:38:05,223
      See, I can bust ba--      

7459
11:38:05,224 --> 11:38:16,976
          excuse me--           
           chops too.           

7460
11:38:16,977 --> 11:38:28,729
   - I was fired from my job.   

7461
11:38:28,730 --> 11:38:40,482
    - You're in jeopardy now    
    of having the second car    

7462
11:38:40,483 --> 11:38:52,235
  forfeited to a tow company.   

7463
11:38:52,236 --> 11:39:03,988
        - They asked me         
  if they could take the car.   

7464
11:39:03,989 --> 11:39:15,741
        I told them no,         
          so I believe          

7465
11:39:15,742 --> 11:39:27,494
          they did it           
     without my permission.     

7466
11:39:27,495 --> 11:39:39,247

           What pain?

7484
11:42:59,049 --> 11:43:10,801
      Lisa, you're charged      
 with going through a red light 

7485
11:43:10,802 --> 11:43:22,554
       on Service Road 8        
        and Broadway...         

7486
11:43:22,555 --> 11:43:34,307
         on July 15th.          

7487
11:43:34,308 --> 11:43:46,060
   Let's take a look at this.   
        Light is yellow.        

7488
11:43:46,061 --> 11:43:57,813
           It's red.            
    And you almost made it.     

7489
11:43:57,814 --> 11:44:09,566
             (man)              
     Red, Your Honor, now.      
      Here's her vehicle.       

7490
11:44:09,567 --> 11:44:21,319
         (Judge Caprio)         
   See where your vehicle is?   
 And the light just turned red. 

7491
11:44:21,320 --> 11:44:33,072
        - First of all,         
    I'd like to let you know    

7492
11:44:33,073 --> 11:44:44,825
    that I'm on disability.     

7493
11:44:44,826 --> 11:44:56,578
         Second of all,         

7494
11:44:56,579 --> 11:45:08,331
         I had my niece         
      and my nephew over,       

7495
11:45:08,332 --> 11:45:20,084
 and I believe they took my car 

7496
11:45:20,085 --> 11:45:31,837
     because I haven't had      
  any violations on my license  

7497
11:45:31,838 --> 11:45:43,590
        in at least five        
        to seven years.         

7498
11:45:43,591 --> 11:45:55,343
        So they asked me        
  if they could take the car.   

7499
11:45:55,344 --> 11:46:07,096
        I told them no,         
    so I believe they did it    

7500
11:46:07,097 --> 11:46:18,849
     without my permission.     

7501
11:46:18,850 --> 11:46:30,602
         And I believe          
       that he's the one        

7502
11:46:30,603 --> 11:46:42,355
     'cause I don't recall      
  going through no red light.   

7503
11:46:42,356 --> 11:46:54,108
    - This was at, uh, like,    
      5:00 in the evening.      

7504
11:46:54,109 --> 11:47:05,861
       Would that be you?       
        - Yeah, I-- no.         

7505
11:47:05,862 --> 11:47:17,614
   I don't believe it was me.   
I believe the kids took the car.

7506
11:47:17,615 --> 11:47:29,367
        I call them kids        
'cause they're younger than me. 

7507
11:47:29,368 --> 11:47:41,120
            - Yeah.             
           (laughing)           

7508
11:47:41,121 --> 11:47:52,873
          - But, uh...          
           But, uh...           

7509
11:47:52,874 --> 11:48:04,626
    - You also have a ticket    
          for parking           

7510
11:48:04,627 --> 11:48:16,379
       in a loading zone        
        on Union Street.        

7511
11:48:16,380 --> 11:48:28,132
       I'm gonna dismiss        
    the loading zone ticket.    

7512
11:48:28,133 --> 11:48:39,885
    - Thank you, Your Honor.    

7513
11:48:39,886 --> 11:48:51,638
 - But when your name came up,  
they picked put his old ticket. 

7514
11:48:51,639 --> 11:49:03,391
     I'm gonna dismiss it.      
    - Oh, thank you so much.    

7515
11:49:03,392 --> 11:49:15,144
    - All right, now we have    
    to get back to the big--    

7516
11:49:15,145 --> 11:49:26,897
         big guns here.         

7517
11:49:26,898 --> 11:49:38,650
This red light violation, okay? 

7518
11:49:38,651 --> 11:49:50,403
   I believe you, all right?    

7519
11:49:50,404 --> 11:50:02,156
 But here's what I'm gonna do.  

7520
11:50:02,157 --> 11:50:13,909
    I'm gonna charge you $35    
          court costs,          

7521
11:50:13,910 --> 11:50:25,662
     and get it from them.      

7522
11:50:25,663 --> 11:50:37,415
          You hear me?          
             - Yes.             

7523
11:50:37,416 --> 11:50:49,168
  - 'Cause you are responsible  
if someone who drives your car--

7524
11:50:49,169 --> 11:51:00,921
         - Your Honor,          
    I can't afford it really    

7525
11:51:00,922 --> 11:51:12,674
   because I'm on disability.   

7526
11:51:12,675 --> 11:51:24,427
        And I only have,        
         uh, 75¢ on me          

7527
11:51:24,428 --> 11:51:36,180
 until my check comes the 1st.  

7528
11:51:36,181 --> 11:51:47,933
    I don't have any money.     

7529
11:51:47,934 --> 11:51:59,686
          And then I--          
        I bought my car,        

7530
11:51:59,687 --> 11:52:11,439
          and, uh, I--          

7531
11:52:11,440 --> 11:52:23,192
   - Lisa, Lisa, Lisa, Lisa.    

7532
11:52:23,193 --> 11:52:34,945
              I--               

7533
11:52:34,946 --> 11:52:46,698
       I'm dismissing it.       

7534
11:52:46,699 --> 11:52:58,451

7535

     Thank you, Your Honor.     

7536
11:53:10,205 --> 11:53:21,957
        - And good luck.        

7537
11:53:21,958 --> 11:53:33,710
 - I really, really appreciate  

7538
11:53:33,711 --> 11:53:45,463
       letting me be able       
  to not have to pay the fine   

7539
11:53:45,464 --> 11:53:57,216
          because I...          
    I don't have the means.     

7540
11:53:57,217 --> 11:54:08,969
    - All right, it's okay.     

7541
11:54:08,970 --> 11:54:20,722

        to tell me about        
      the parking tickets?      

7562
11:58:15,783 --> 11:58:27,535
  - Just that, you know, I-I--  

7563
11:58:27,536 --> 11:58:39,288
 It was right when they started 
 doing that thing where they--  

7564
11:58:39,289 --> 11:58:51,041
     you had a parking spot     
        and you had pay         

7565
11:58:51,042 --> 11:59:02,794
   down the street somewhere,   
       and I had no idea        
        how to do that.         

7566
11:59:02,795 --> 11:59:14,547
  - Oh, the multi-spacace meter.
            - Yeah.             

7567
11:59:14,548 --> 11:59:26,300
But I did do it, and I know that
        that was this--         

7568
11:59:26,301 --> 11:59:38,053
        it was back then        
  when they started doing that  

7569
11:59:38,054 --> 11:59:49,806
   and I didn't know anything   
        about all that.         

7570
11:59:49,807 --> 12:00:01,559
      - Well, they got 'em      
 at three different locations.  

7571
12:00:01,560 --> 12:00:13,312
     It's not one location.     
       - I know, I know.        

7572
12:00:13,313 --> 12:00:25,065
          No, I know.           
     I'm bad-- it's my bad.     

7573
12:00:25,066 --> 12:00:36,818
   I'm just really happy to--   
    I wanna clear my slate.     

7574
12:00:36,819 --> 12:00:48,571
  - Are you ready to confess?   
            - I am.             

7575
12:00:48,572 --> 12:01:00,324
I feel like this is confession. 

7576
12:01:00,325 --> 12:01:12,077
       - Inspector Quinn,       
     we have a confession.      

7577
12:01:12,078 --> 12:01:23,830
          - (laughing)          

7578
12:01:23,831 --> 12:01:35,583
 Your Honor, it's been a while  
 since I've been to confession, 

7579
12:01:35,584 --> 12:01:47,336
           so, uh...            
      - (Judge Caprio) Oh.      

7580
12:01:47,337 --> 12:01:59,089
            (Quinn)             
 ...I can't fault the motorist. 

7581
12:01:59,090 --> 12:02:10,842
- Well, while you're confessing,

7582
12:02:10,843 --> 12:02:22,595
        we have a number        
  of unsolved crimes upstairs.  

7583
12:02:22,596 --> 12:02:34,348
      Do you wanna confess      
        to any of those?        

7584
12:02:34,349 --> 12:02:46,101
  We could clear them all out.  
            - Okay.             

7585
12:02:46,102 --> 12:02:57,854
      - What do you think,      
        Inspector Quinn?        

7586
12:02:57,855 --> 12:03:09,607
     - That-- I will accept     
        that confession,        

7587
12:03:09,608 --> 12:03:21,360
   Your Honor, all day long,    
       to clear the desk.       

7588
12:03:21,361 --> 12:03:33,113
- All right, I'm gonna fine you 
 $85 for one of the red lights  

7589
12:03:33,114 --> 12:03:44,866
        and $30 for one         
    of the parking tickets.     

7590
12:03:44,867 --> 12:03:56,619
      - I appreciate that.      
 - So it's gonna cost you $115. 

7591
12:03:56,620 --> 12:04:08,372
       - Okay, thank you        
     very, very much, sir.      

7592
12:04:08,373 --> 12:04:20,125
      - Good luck to you.       
            - Okay.             

7593
12:04:20,126 --> 12:04:31,878
     - I know you can't be      
         his girlfriend         

7594
12:04:31,879 --> 12:04:43,631
       because basketball       
       is his girlfriend.       

7595
12:04:43,632 --> 12:04:55,384
 If I was standing next to you, 
 I wouldn't wear that T-shirt.  

7596
12:04:55,385 --> 12:05:07,137
          - Thank you.          

7597
12:05:07,138 --> 12:05:18,890
        - Donna Morales.        

7598
12:05:18,891 --> 12:05:30,643
      Good morning, Donna.      
        - Good morning.         

7599
12:05:30,644 --> 12:05:42,396
       - Donna, your car        
       was, uh... towed.        

7600
12:05:42,397 --> 12:05:54,149
      It was booted first.      
        It wasn't paid.         

7601
12:05:54,150 --> 12:06:05,902
   As a result, it got towed.   

7602
12:06:05,903 --> 12:06:17,655
           - Correct.           
     - The car got towed...     

7603
12:06:17,656 --> 12:06:29,408
          last month?           

7604
12:06:29,409 --> 12:06:41,161
             - Yes.             

7605
12:06:41,162 --> 12:06:52,914
 - Why did it take you a month  
    to come in here on this?    

7606
12:06:52,915 --> 12:07:04,667
      - Well, Your Honor,       
          I just, uh--          

7607
12:07:04,668 --> 12:07:16,420
    I was fired from my job.    
      I didn't have a job.      

7608
12:07:16,421 --> 12:07:28,173
              Um--              
             - No.              

7609
12:07:28,174 --> 12:07:39,926
 Well, let me go through this.  

7610
12:07:39,927 --> 12:07:51,679
     Your car was booted...     
        two months ago?         

7611
12:07:51,680 --> 12:08:03,432
 - No, that's, um, the Nissan.  

7612
12:08:03,433 --> 12:08:15,185
       I have my Infinity       
that was just booted last week. 

7613
12:08:15,186 --> 12:08:26,938
        - Wait a minute.        
         Wait a minute.         

7614
12:08:26,939 --> 12:08:38,691
  There are two vehicles here?  
   - Yes, two vehicles, but--   

7615
12:08:38,692 --> 12:08:50,444
- Let me go through this slowly.
           (chuckles)           

7616
12:08:50,445 --> 12:09:02,197
 The first vehicle is a Nissan. 

7617
12:09:02,198 --> 12:09:13,950
     I'm just-- I just know     
     what I have before me.     

7618
12:09:13,951 --> 12:09:25,703
           - Correct.           
   - It appears that that car   

7619
12:09:25,704 --> 12:09:37,456
      was blooted-- booted      
    a couple of months ago.     

7620
12:09:37,457 --> 12:09:49,209
           - Correct.           
       - And then towed.        

7621
12:09:49,210 --> 12:10:00,962
           - Correct.           
- It's still at the tow company?

7622
12:10:00,963 --> 12:10:12,715
           - Correct.           

7623
12:10:12,716 --> 12:10:24,468
         - Are you here         
       for that vehicle?        

7624
12:10:24,469 --> 12:10:36,221
         - No, I'm not.         
       Unfortunately, I--       

7625
12:10:36,222 --> 12:10:47,974
  The reason why it got towed   
     and I didn't come in--     

7626
12:10:47,975 --> 12:10:59,727
  I was not able to register.   

7627
12:10:59,728 --> 12:11:11,480
      I was in the process      
        of registering.         

7628
12:11:11,481 --> 12:11:23,233
   I bought it from a dealer    
      off of the Internet.      

7629
12:11:23,234 --> 12:11:34,986
    And something was wrong     
     with the title that--      

7630
12:11:34,987 --> 12:11:46,739
       so it looked like        
  three people were on there.   

7631
12:11:46,740 --> 12:11:58,492
I was dealing with Miss Mancini 
         from the DMV.          

7632
12:11:58,493 --> 12:12:10,245
    She said, unfortunately,    
 we couldn't get it registered. 

7633
12:12:10,246 --> 12:12:21,998
    - Oh, you bought a car.     
            To use--            

7634
12:12:21,999 --> 12:12:33,751
  To use the street language,   
  the car was a gaffe, right?   

7635
12:12:33,752 --> 12:12:45,504
       - Basically, yes.        
             And--              

7636
12:12:45,505 --> 12:12:57,257
        - So, all right.        
They had trouble with the title.

7637
12:12:57,258 --> 12:13:09,010
     You bought it online.      
  You couldn't get it cleared.  

7638
12:13:09,011 --> 12:13:20,763
           All right,           
     I understand all that.     

7639
12:13:20,764 --> 12:13:32,516
   So you forfeited that car.   
            - Right.            

7640
12:13:32,517 --> 12:13:44,269
 - The tow guys got it, right?  
- Right, so that's why I didn't.

7641
12:13:44,270 --> 12:13:56,022
    - So you said, "Keep it.    
    I don't care about it."     

7642
12:13:56,023 --> 12:14:07,775
  - 'Cause you can't-- the DMV  
   said I can't register it.    

7643
12:14:07,776 --> 12:14:19,528
   - And... on the Infinity,    

7644
12:14:19,529 --> 12:14:31,281
      you had 11 tickets.       

7645
12:14:31,282 --> 12:14:43,034
    None of which were paid.    

7646
12:14:43,035 --> 12:14:54,787
       Most of them were        
       overnight parking        
      outside your house.       

7647
12:14:54,788 --> 12:15:06,540
       - Yes, Your Honor.       
       My landlord, uh--        

7648
12:15:06,541 --> 12:15:18,293
 I tried to file for the, um--  
      to see if I can get       

7649
12:15:18,294 --> 12:15:30,046
 the overnight parking ticket,  
        but because we--        

7650
12:15:30,047 --> 12:15:41,799
     there's six apartments     
          in my house,          

7651
12:15:41,800 --> 12:15:53,552
  the landlord had to go down   
  and do something, they said.  

7652
12:15:53,553 --> 12:16:05,305
  He finally just did it now.   

7653
12:16:05,306 --> 12:16:17,058
       And I lost my job.       
  That's why I didn't come in.  

7654
12:16:17,059 --> 12:16:28,811
     I'm just back to work,     
     so now I can take care     

7655
12:16:28,812 --> 12:16:40,564
     of the parking tickets     
        and everything.         

7656
12:16:40,565 --> 12:16:52,317
    I'm not here to give you    
           an excuse.           

7657
12:16:52,318 --> 12:17:04,070
  I'm fully responsible for it  
      and willing to pay.       

7658
12:17:04,071 --> 12:17:15,823
      - All right, Donna,       
     you're in jeopardy now     

7659
12:17:15,824 --> 12:17:27,576
 of having the second car towed 
and forfeited to a tow company. 

7660
12:17:27,577 --> 12:17:39,329
           - Correct.           

7661
12:17:39,330 --> 12:17:51,082
 - So what do you wanna tell me 
          about these?          

7662
12:17:51,083 --> 12:18:02,835
          Did you come          
      prepared today to--       

7663
12:18:02,836 --> 12:18:14,588
    prepared to pay-- to pay    
  for the boot to be released?  

7664
12:18:14,589 --> 12:18:26,341
    - I have right now $300,    
  Your Honor, that I can give,  

7665
12:18:26,342 --> 12:18:38,094
   and then I could come back   
           every week           

7666
12:18:38,095 --> 12:18:49,847
       and make a payment       
     towards them tickets--     

7667
12:18:49,848 --> 12:19:01,600
   - Your record hasn't been    
           that good.           

7668
12:19:01,601 --> 12:19:13,353
         You know that?         
       - I know, I know.        

7669
12:19:13,354 --> 12:19:25,106
       - But you changed.       

7670
12:19:25,107 --> 12:19:36,859
     - I-I have a good job.     
         I lost my job.         

7671
12:19:36,860 --> 12:19:48,612
  I got a-- I'm back to work.   
       I am not losing--        

7672
12:19:48,613 --> 12:20:00,365
   I'm not gonna lose my job.   

7673
12:20:00,366 --> 12:20:12,118
    I have no other choice.     

7674
12:20:12,119 --> 12:20:23,871
             But...             
           (laughing)           

7675
12:20:23,872 --> 12:20:35,624
      But I will be making      
   the payments, Your Honor.    

7676

       In your defense...       

7678
12:20:59,131 --> 12:21:10,883
 'cause I really wanna be fair  
        with you, okay?         

7679
12:21:10,884 --> 12:21:22,636
  Almost all of these tickets   

7680
12:21:22,637 --> 12:21:34,389
      are parking in front      
    of your house overnight.    

7681
12:21:34,390 --> 12:21:46,142
And I have some sympathy for you
        because of that.        

7682
12:21:46,143 --> 12:21:57,895
  'Cause we have an ordinance   
         in Providence          

7683
12:21:57,896 --> 12:22:09,648
 that you cannot park overnight 
 on the streets in Providence.  

7684
12:22:09,649 --> 12:22:21,401
     And I know that many--     
         many landlords         

7685
12:22:21,402 --> 12:22:33,154
  don't have sufficient number  
       of parking spaces        

7686
12:22:33,155 --> 12:22:44,907
       for their tenants        
 and the tenants have no choice 

7687
12:22:44,908 --> 12:22:56,660
   but to park on the street.   

7688
12:22:56,661 --> 12:23:08,413
All right, the original tickets 
           are $835.            

7689
12:23:08,414 --> 12:23:20,166

7690
12:23:20,167 --> 12:23:31,919
  All right, I'm gonna dismiss  
    a number of the tickets     

7691
12:23:31,920 --> 12:23:43,672
     on Monticello Street.      

7692
12:23:43,673 --> 12:23:55,425
      It's gonna cost you       
        a $100 boot fee,        

7693
12:23:55,426 --> 12:24:07,178

 and I'm gonna release the boot 

7694
12:24:07,179 --> 12:24:18,931
  as soon as you pay the 300,   
   which will be today, okay?   

7695
12:24:18,932 --> 12:24:30,684
            - Okay.             
   - You have a $100 balance.   

7696
12:24:30,685 --> 12:24:42,437
       You're gonna have

7697
12:24:42,438 --> 12:24:54,190
            - Okay.             

7698
12:24:54,191 --> 12:25:05,943
       - Try to pay that        
      as quick as possible      

7699
12:25:05,944 --> 12:25:17,696
      so that you can buy       
         a parking pass         

7700
12:25:17,697 --> 12:25:29,449
so you can park the car in front
   of your house for a year.    

7701
12:25:29,450 --> 12:25:41,202
  Okay, so as soon as you pay   
         the other 100,         

7702
12:25:41,203 --> 12:25:52,955
       you'll be eligible       
     to buy a parking pass.     

7703
12:25:52,956 --> 12:26:04,708

    next Friday, Your Honor.    

7704
12:26:04,709 --> 12:26:16,461

     she was disillusioned,     

7736
12:32:20,805 --> 12:32:32,557
     thinking that she had      
     a chance here, right?      

7737
12:32:32,558 --> 12:32:44,310
         His girlfriend         
      is basketball, so--       

7738
12:32:44,311 --> 12:32:56,063

    Let's get you caught up.    

9036
25:52:02,843 --> 25:52:03,481
   Morgan and Jay have worked   
     through their issues,      
   and are on the up and up.    

9037
25:52:03,482 --> 25:52:04,120
What's my favorite

9039
25:52:04,760 --> 25:52:05,398
          (announcer)           
 But Corey seems to be the pain 
in their ass that won't go away.

9040
25:52:05,399 --> 25:52:06,037
 Chad and Nicole's relationship 
  is moving to the next level,  

9041
25:52:06,038 --> 25:52:06,676
      taking each other's       
         measurements.          

9042
25:52:06,677 --> 25:52:07,315
         Wow, you (bleep) it up.
         I had it.              
No, here.                       
I got it.                       

9043
25:52:07,316 --> 25:52:07,954
I'm gonna measure it for you,   
you (bleep) ding-a-ling.        

9044
25:52:07,955 --> 25:52:08,593
          (announcer)           
  Janelle's still running hot   
    after attacking Diandra     

9045
25:52:08,594 --> 25:52:09,232
   for kissing her ex Darian.   

9046
25:52:09,233 --> 25:52:09,871
  And Farrah's discovering her  
       ripped-up posters,       

9047
25:52:09,872 --> 25:52:10,510
   which was payback by Nurys   
for being kicked in the cooter. 

9048
25:52:10,511 --> 25:52:11,149
Oh, my God.                     
Someone came up here            
and (bleep) up my signs.        

9049
25:52:11,150 --> 25:52:11,788
All right, so that's            
the (bleep) you started!        

9050
25:52:11,789 --> 25:52:12,427
Did she (bleep) do this?        

9051
25:52:12,428 --> 25:52:13,066
                 She might have 
                 did it, Farrah.
Okay.                           

9052
25:52:13,067 --> 25:52:13,705
     Well, this is the best one.
Did someone                     
(bleep) up my-- okay.           

9053
25:52:13,706 --> 25:52:14,344
All right.                      

9054
25:52:14,345 --> 25:52:14,983
Don't attack all of my amazing, 
        amazing signs...        

9055
25:52:14,984 --> 25:52:15,622
    that my housemates spent    
  their time on making for me.  

9056
25:52:15,623 --> 25:52:16,261
Did someone have an idea        
to (bleep) bend all my signs?   

9057
25:52:16,262 --> 25:52:16,900
■    I (bleep) did! I did!      
     I happily (bleep) did!     

9058
25:52:16,901 --> 25:52:17,539
  I did, I did, I did, I did!   
           Nurys did!           

9059
25:52:17,540 --> 25:52:18,178
         She kicked me.         
       She decided to put       
        her hands on me,        

9060
25:52:18,179 --> 25:52:18,817
        so I grabbed her        
     "free Farrah" posters      
   and I ripped them in half.   

9061
25:52:18,818 --> 25:52:19,456
                       Stop! No!
  You think I give a (bleep)?   

9062
25:52:19,457 --> 25:52:20,095
You think I give a (bleep)?     
                 No, no, no, no!
                 Nurys, no!     

9063
25:52:20,096 --> 25:52:20,734
Diandra, Diandra!               
            I know!             

9064
25:52:20,735 --> 25:52:21,373
  If you wanna touch my stuff,  
       your (bleep) gets        

9065
25:52:21,374 --> 25:52:22,012

        down the toilet.        

9066
25:52:22,013 --> 25:52:22,651
 Okay, touch my (bleep), bitch. 
 Touch it, I dare you.          

9067
25:52:22,652 --> 25:52:23,290

            (bleep).            
                         (Nurys)
                         I did. 

9068
25:52:23,291 --> 25:52:23,929
      You ugly-ass bitch!       
Oh, I'm ugly, bitch?            

9069
25:52:23,930 --> 25:52:24,568

have you had to fix your face   
and your body?                  

9070
25:52:24,569 --> 25:52:25,207
I haven't done not one thing    
to my body or my face           

9071
25:52:25,208 --> 25:52:25,846

9180
25:53:34,859 --> 25:53:35,497
                 I don't need   
                 a third, Romeo.

9181
25:53:35,498 --> 25:53:36,136
          I think me and Jay are
          on good terms finally.

9182
25:53:36,137 --> 25:53:36,775
So Corey's not                  
confusing things for you?       

9183
25:53:36,776 --> 25:53:37,414
         Um, I just don't think 
         it's gonna work between
         me and him.            

9184
25:53:37,415 --> 25:53:38,053
Nicole, how are things          
with you and Chad?              

9185
25:53:38,054 --> 25:53:38,692
        We're good.             
        I feel like you're gonna
        (bleep) it up though,   

9186
25:53:38,693 --> 25:53:39,331
           so bring on the exes.

9187
25:53:39,332 --> 25:53:39,970
            (Romeo)             
       By the end of this       
       whole experience,        

9188
25:53:39,971 --> 25:53:40,609
 some of you may find new love, 

9189
25:53:40,610 --> 25:53:41,248
   rekindle with an old love,   
   or just say (bleep) love.    

9190
25:53:41,249 --> 25:53:41,887
     But the real question:     
Are you completely over your ex?

9191
25:53:41,888 --> 25:53:42,526
           It's time.           
                             No.

9192
25:53:42,527 --> 25:53:43,165
      Let's bring 'em out.      

9193
25:53:43,166 --> 25:53:43,804
            (bleep).

     Like, he doesn't need      
          to be here.           

9195
25:53:44,444 --> 25:53:45,082
      Just throw him back       
         in the water.          

9196
25:53:45,083 --> 25:53:45,721
    It's like, how much more    
          can I take?           

9197
25:53:45,722 --> 25:53:46,360
     I haven't cracked yet,     
    but I feel like if an ex    

9198
25:53:46,361 --> 25:53:46,999
    comes out of the water,     
I might reach my cracking point.

       My name is Monte,        
    from Memphis, Tennessee,    

9204
25:53:50,195 --> 25:53:50,833
    and you may know me from    
  "Big Brother: Over the Top."  

9205
25:53:50,834 --> 25:53:51,472
 Being a southern gentleman is  
  about treating a girl right.  

9206
25:53:51,473 --> 25:53:52,111
   Opening the door for her,    
   not cussing, acting a fool

9207

       Me and Morgan met        
   in the Big Brother house.    

9209
25:53:53,390 --> 25:53:54,028
    We dated for six months     
      and then she decided      

9210
25:53:54,029 --> 25:53:54,667
   she wants to move to L.A.,   
     so that kind of put a,

      I'm here to not only      
    rekindle me and Morgan,     

9213
25:53:55,946 --> 25:53:56,584
     but I know for a fact      
     that Morgan is the one     
   I wanna settle down with.    

9214
25:53:56,585 --> 25:53:57,223
And I'm at that point in my life
        where I'm ready.        

9215
25:53:57,224 --> 25:53:57,862
                 What's up, man?
                 Doing good.    
What's going on, Monte?         

9216
25:53:57,863 --> 25:53:58,501
How do you like                 
seeing Morgan over there?       
     She looks pretty good, man.

9217
25:53:58,502 --> 25:53:59,140
             Stop.

9222
25:54:01,697 --> 25:54:02,335
              Ugh!              

9223
25:54:02,336 --> 25:54:02,974
What happened between           
y'all two?                      

9224
25:54:02,975 --> 25:54:03,613
               I ended up moving
               to Los Angeles.  

9225
25:54:03,614 --> 25:54:04,252
            It was too much     
            of long distance    
            got in the way and--

9226
25:54:04,253 --> 25:54:04,891
So you left him hanging?        
        It was too hard being   
        so far apart.           

9227
25:54:04,892 --> 25:54:05,530
    Seeing Monte brings back    
    a lot of good memories.     

9228
25:54:05,531 --> 25:54:06,169
      We don't really have      
          any fights.           

9229
25:54:06,170 --> 25:54:06,808
You real flustered              
right now, like--               

9230
25:54:06,809 --> 25:54:07,447
      Yeah, G  because I'm alreG

9231
25:54:07,448 --> 25:54:08,086
             with two exes,     
You real flusand now you'reGg i.
right now, like--               

9232
25:54:08,087 --> 25:54:08,725
But this connection             
seem genuine right here.        

9233
25:54:08,726 --> 25:54:09,364
Even from the other ones,       
I'm feeling something.          

9234
25:54:09,365 --> 25:54:10,003
           I think there is     
           a genuine connection,
           but it's difficult   

9235
25:54:10,004 --> 25:54:10,642
       because I got some issues
       back at the house.       

9236
25:54:10,643 --> 25:54:11,281
Don't play with Jay's feelings. 

9237
25:54:11,282 --> 25:54:11,920
 I think that this is something 

9238
25:54:11,921 --> 25:54:12,559
     between Jay and Morgan     
that can potentially ruin them. 

9239
25:54:12,560 --> 25:54:13,198
We got some things              
to figure out.                  

9240
25:54:13,199 --> 25:54:13,837

9287
25:54:43,232 --> 25:54:43,870
        I feel like I'm         
an emotional wreck at all times 
         in this house.         

9288
25:54:43,871 --> 25:54:44,509
 It's like I'm the only person  
        with three exes.        

9289
25:54:44,510 --> 25:54:45,148
Some people don't even have one 
 ex and I'm dealing with three. 

9290
25:54:45,149 --> 25:54:45,787
 Like, I need to get Corey out  
of this house, and he's honestly
         pretty boring.         

9291
25:54:45,788 --> 25:54:46,426
Jay came in the house.          
I kind of rekindled things      
with him.                       

9292
25:54:46,427 --> 25:54:47,065
Then Corey came in,             
so it was kind of like...       
                  Double whammy.

9293
25:54:47,066 --> 25:54:47,704
...a weird messy                
love triangle.                  

9294
25:54:47,705 --> 25:54:48,343
But I thought I had it          
figured out till you            
walked up on the beach.         

9295
25:54:48,344 --> 25:54:48,982
    Me and Monte had a great    
   relationship before this.    

9296
25:54:48,983 --> 25:54:49,621
      It didn't end badly.      
      My family loves him.      

9297
25:54:49,622 --> 25:54:50,260
  He's unfortunately the exact  
    kind of guy that my dad     

9298
25:54:50,261 --> 25:54:50,899
    would want me to marry,     
      which is terrifying.      

9299
25:54:50,900 --> 25:54:51,538
              You're my girl.   
              Everything happens
              for a reason.     

9300
25:54:51,539 --> 25:54:52,177
              So I really think,
              you know,         
              Jay might be cool,

9301
25:54:52,178 --> 25:54:52,816
         but, you know,         
         you gotta remember back
         to what we had too.    

9302
25:54:52,817 --> 25:54:53,455
          We could rekindle that
          even better.          

9303
25:54:53,456 --> 25:54:54,094
     I don't know who this      
      Jay guy is, but, uh,      

9304
25:54:54,095 --> 25:54:54,733
     he's gonna have to run     
     for his money, 'cause,     
      uh, Monte's coming.       

9305
25:54:54,734 --> 25:54:55,372
            Give me a fair shot.
            That's all I ask.   

9306
25:54:55,373 --> 25:54:56,011
Okay.                           
              And I promise you,
              you'll reconsider.

9310
25:54:57,929 --> 25:54:58,567
     How you feeling though     
         this morning?          
                       I'm cool.

9311
25:54:58,568 --> 25:54:59,206
  Like, the only thing I was    
  actually, like, I was thinking
  about, like, last night, was, 

9312
25:54:59,207 --> 25:54:59,845
 like, no one ever pulled her   
 to the side and was like,      
 "Yo, I understand you're upset,

9313
25:54:59,846 --> 25:55:00,484
 but, like, how you're reacting,
 like, that's not okay."        

9314
25:55:00,485 --> 25:55:01,123
    Depending on how Janelle    
   comes back from the hotel,   

9315
25:55:01,124 --> 25:55:01,762
     I'm hoping to see, uh,     
     a new-- a new person.      

9316
25:55:01,763 --> 25:55:02,401
      Uh, the girl that I       
         used to know.          

9317
25:55:02,402 --> 25:55:03,040
          Here we go.           

9318
25:55:03,041 --> 25:55:03,679
              Oh, (bleep)!      
              Oh, Nicole! Sha!  
Chad, you're safe!              

9319
25:55:03,680 --> 25:55:04,318
     So Nicole is back now      
  and she doesn't have an ex,   
       and I'm just like,       

9320
25:55:04,319 --> 25:55:04,957
"Thank God I don't have to deal 
     with that situation."      

9321
25:55:04,958 --> 25:55:05,596
        So how did the guy look?
        Tell me.                

9322
25:55:05,597 --> 25:55:06,235
               Does he look cute
               or whatever?     

9323
25:55:06,236 --> 25:55:06,874
I'm kind of scared              
for Jay.                        

9324
25:55:06,875 --> 25:55:07,513
(Janelle)                       
Why?                            

9325
25:55:07,514 --> 25:55:08,152
He said he's here               
to get her back,                

9326
25:55:08,153 --> 25:55:08,791
and he's here for no other      
reason but to get her back.     

9327
25:55:08,792 --> 25:55:09,430
                    (Chad)      
                    Oh, (bleep).

9328
25:55:09,431 --> 25:55:10,069
 Honestly, it should be called  
  "Morgan's Ex on the Beach."   

9329
25:55:10,070 --> 25:55:10,708
      Like, how many exes       
       do you have, girl?       
        Like, just stop.        

9330
25:55:10,709 --> 25:55:11,347
           (cheering)           

9331
25:55:11,348 --> 25:55:11,986
        (all exclaiming)        

9332
25:55:11,987 --> 25:55:12,625
All right, pull the chair,      
pull the chair, pull the chair. 
Hold on.                        

9333
25:55:12,626 --> 25:55:13,264
          Hey, Morgan.          
          Take a seat.          

9334
25:55:13,265 --> 25:55:13,903
                 Let the man    
                 do the talking.

9335
25:55:13,904 --> 25:55:14,542
Gah damn.                       

9336
25:55:14,543 --> 25:55:15,181
           (laughter)           

9337
25:55:15,182 --> 25:55:15,820
This Monte character?           
(grunts) Damn!                  
                            Ugh!

9338
25:55:15,821 --> 25:55:16,459
Um, I will say this.            

9339
25:55:16,460 --> 25:55:17,098
All the boys you                
brought into the house          
are fine as (bleep).            

9340
25:55:17,099 --> 25:55:17,737
And-- yes.                      
              So at least       
              I have good taste.

9341
25:55:17,738 --> 25:55:18,376
          What are you here for?
       What are your intentions?

9342
25:55:18,377 --> 25:55:19,015
What are my intentions?         
    Are you here to be with her?

9343
25:55:19,016 --> 25:55:19,654
■÷  Are ■;  to rekindle that fi?
Hell yeah, man.                 

9344
25:55:19,655 --> 25:55:20,293
I'm gonna rekindle the fire.    
What are you talking about?     
              Okay, there we go.

9345
25:55:20,294 --> 25:55:20,932
"Oh, I'm gonna be just Mr. Tough
  Guy here to steal your girl.  

9346
25:55:20,933 --> 25:55:21,571
 "I'ma flirt with her in front  
  of you and I'm gonna pretend  
         like I'm not.          

9347
25:55:21,572 --> 25:55:22,210
      Ha ha! I'm so cool!"      
             Clown.             

9348
25:55:22,211 --> 25:55:22,849
    If things don't work out    
           with Jay,            

9349
25:55:22,850 --> 25:55:23,488
   are we allowed to take him   
     into our relationship?     

9350
25:55:23,489 --> 25:55:24,127
8                               
           (laughter)           

9351
25:55:24,128 --> 25:55:24,766
You're allowed to take him      
right now if you want.          
We can share.                   

9352
25:55:24,767 --> 25:55:25,405
          (announcer)           
     Oh, God, it's so sweet     
      it's making me sick.      

9353
25:55:25,406 --> 25:55:26,044
   Let's see if everyone else   
     can be so levelheaded      

9354
25:55:26,045 --> 25:55:26,683
 as Janelle, Farrah, and Nurys  
     return from their stay     
         at the hotel.          

9355
25:55:26,684 --> 25:55:27,322
Baby, baby, baby!               
Hey!                            

9356
25:55:27,323 --> 25:55:27,961
ç■■7■7's Janelle.               
                   Hey!         

9357
25:55:27,962 --> 25:55:28,600
Whoo!                           
           What's up?           

9358
25:55:28,601 --> 25:55:29,239
      So I've had a night       
      to cool down, relax.      

9359
25:55:29,240 --> 25:55:29,878
  Going in the house, for me,   
        it is stressful         

9360
25:55:29,879 --> 25:55:30,517
      because I'm dealing       
         with the fact          

9361
25:55:30,518 --> 25:55:31,156
    that I really am, like,     
     heartbroken for real.      

9362
25:55:31,157 --> 25:55:31,795
  Diandra, can I talk to you?   
Yes.                            

9363
25:55:31,796 --> 25:55:32,434
         My main point          
     to pull Diandra aside      

9364
25:55:32,435 --> 25:55:33,073
    was to apologize to her     
  and let her know that, hey,   

9365
25:55:33,074 --> 25:55:33,712
   I know we've had our beefs   
          in the past.          

9366
25:55:33,713 --> 25:55:34,351
   Like, I know we personally   
   don't care for each other,   

9367
25:55:34,352 --> 25:55:34,990
  but the attack I made on her  
    was not personal at all.    

9368
25:55:34,991 --> 25:55:35,629
So basically I just wanted      
to genuinely apologize          
for putting my hands on you.    

9369
25:55:35,630 --> 25:55:36,268
Like, my issues are with him.   
Like, I should conduct myself   
better just as a human being.   

9370
25:55:36,269 --> 25:55:36,907
You (bleep) kiss her?!          
You're gonna kiss her?!         

9371
25:55:36,908 --> 25:55:37,546
                 That is her ex.

9372
25:55:37,547 --> 25:55:38,185
          Oh, (bleep).          
  Oh, you ain't tell me that.   

9373
25:55:38,186 --> 25:55:38,824
(bleep) you laughing,           
bitch?!                         

9374
25:55:38,825 --> 25:55:39,463
   Janelle! Janelle! Janelle!   
You (bleep)hole!                

9375
25:55:39,464 --> 25:55:40,102
So I apologize.                 
          I accept your apology.

9376
25:55:40,103 --> 25:55:40,741
                Um, I wasn't    
                laughing at you.

9377
25:55:40,742 --> 25:55:41,380
       Like, I'm sorry.         
       Like, when I get nervous,
       I'm like...              

9378
25:55:41,381 --> 25:55:42,019
               (nervous chuckle)
               But I literally--

9379
25:55:42,020 --> 25:55:42,658
      all I said, I looked back,
      like, this is crazy.      

9380
25:55:42,659 --> 25:55:43,297
      And thankful that you came
      to apologize for putting  
      your hands on me.         

9381
25:55:43,298 --> 25:55:43,936
No problem.                     
Like, I meant it, but I         
shouldn't be hitting people.    

9382
25:55:43,937 --> 25:55:44,575
I saw Janelle go up to Diandra, 
 apologize for the whole thing, 

9383
25:55:44,576 --> 25:55:45,214
       argument they had,       
 and just literally broke down. 

9384
25:55:45,215 --> 25:55:45,853
       And you know what?       
    It takes a grown person     
to apologize and to admit that. 

9385
25:55:45,854 --> 25:55:46,492
          I accept your apology.

9386
25:55:46,493 --> 25:55:47,131
 With me, if someone says sorry 
  and they genuinely mean it,   

9387
25:55:47,132 --> 25:55:47,770
■     I will forgi              

9388
25:55:47,771 --> 25:55:48,409
 With me,Will I forget?ys sorry 
  and No. I'm not stupid. it,   

9389
25:55:48,410 --> 25:55:49,048
     I will definitely keep     
        my eyes up open,        

9390
25:55:49,049 --> 25:55:49,687
 but the minute you say sorry,  
    all right, clean slate.     

9391
25:55:49,688 --> 25:55:50,326
I'ma do a handshake.            
                           Okay.

9392
25:55:50,327 --> 25:55:50,965
             We'll take it slow.
Yes.                            

9393
25:55:50,966 --> 25:55:51,604
Okay. Okay, thank you.          
           All right.           

9394
25:55:51,605 --> 25:55:52,243
          (announcer)           
Now that Janelle and Diandra are
       on the same page,        

9395
25:55:52,244 --> 25:55:52,882
   the house vibes seem to be   
        in a good place.        

9396
25:55:52,883 --> 25:55:53,521
     Maybe Farrah and Nurys     
   can squash their beef too?   

9397
25:55:53,522 --> 25:55:54,160
         Hello, house.          

9398
25:55:54,161 --> 25:55:54,799
          Hey, Farrah.          

9399
25:55:54,800 --> 25:55:55,438
             Hello.             

9400
25:55:55,439 --> 25:55:56,077
      There's another one.      

9401
25:55:56,078 --> 25:55:56,716
       So I'm back today        
   and I'm going in the house   

9402
25:55:56,717 --> 25:55:57,355
   and I'm just staying away    
   from literally everything,   

9403
25:55:57,356 --> 25:55:57,994
  everyone, and (bleep) them.   

9404
25:55:57,995 --> 25:55:58,633
              Aww.              
Have a drink.                   

9405
25:55:58,634 --> 25:55:59,272
           I'm back.            
           I'm back.            

9406
25:55:59,273 --> 25:55:59,911
          (screaming)           

9407
25:55:59,912 --> 25:56:00,550
           (laughter)           

9408
25:56:00,551 --> 25:56:01,189
      I'm extremely happy       
   that Nurys came back here.   

9409
25:56:01,190 --> 25:56:01,828
     She did nothing wrong,     
   but I understand as to why   
       she had to leave.        

9410
25:56:01,829 --> 25:56:02,467
    But I am genuinely upset    
   that Farrah is still here.   

9411
25:56:02,468 --> 25:56:03,106
I'm gonna go ahead and leave it 
    in the fate of the Lord     

9412
25:56:03,107 --> 25:56:03,745
 and He will take care of that. 
        Karma's a bitch.        

9413
25:56:03,746 --> 25:56:04,384
      (indistinct chatter)      

9414
25:56:04,385 --> 25:56:05,023
         Good.                  
         So if I started talking
         to another girl,       

9415
25:56:05,024 --> 25:56:05,662
        she'd probably find out.
Hey, can we talk?               

9416
25:56:05,663 --> 25:56:06,301
        Hi, how are you?        
             Sure.              

9417
25:56:06,302 --> 25:56:06,940
In private?                     
             Okay.              

9418
25:56:06,941 --> 25:56:07,579
          I don't have          
      to (bleep) apologize      

9419
25:56:07,580 --> 25:56:08,218
     because I reacted like     
     a normal human being,      

9420
25:56:08,219 --> 25:56:08,857
    but better than a normal    
          human being,          

9421
25:56:08,858 --> 25:56:09,496
  'cause a normal human being   
     wouldn't have stopped      
      (bleep) hitting her.      

9422
25:56:09,497 --> 25:56:10,135
          (announcer)           
 Actually, a normal human being 

9423
25:56:10,136 --> 25:56:10,774
 probably wouldn't kick someone 
         in the vagina.         

9424
25:56:10,775 --> 25:56:11,413
          I guess I just wanted 
          to ask where your head
          was at yesterday.     

9425
25:56:11,414 --> 25:56:12,052
            'Cause I'm confused 
            as to where all that
            animosity came from.

9426
25:56:12,053 --> 25:56:12,691
                All that, like--
Okay, so I'm                    
not confused.                   

9427
25:56:12,692 --> 25:56:13,330
I'm very aware about            
what happened yesterday.        

9428
25:56:13,331 --> 25:56:13,969
When I come in                  
to just hear what               

9429
25:56:13,970 --> 25:56:14,608
my friend's ex-boyfriend        
is saying,                      

9430
25:56:14,609 --> 25:56:15,247
all I'm hearing is insults,     
um, from you about me,          

9431
25:56:15,248 --> 25:56:15,886
acting like you know me.        
I think--                       

9432
25:56:15,887 --> 25:56:16,525
       That all was brought up  
       afterwards, so that's not
       what we're talking about.

9433
25:56:16,526 --> 25:56:17,164
And continuation of that        
and that was--                  
          No, see, now you're   
          trying to play victim.

9434
25:56:17,165 --> 25:56:17,803
            That's not what     
            we're gonna do.     
So I'm not a victim.            

9435
25:56:17,804 --> 25:56:18,442
So I know you                   
were just drinking.             
I'm not drinking.               

9436
25:56:18,443 --> 25:56:19,081
                     Okay. Okay.
I'm wide awake.                 
I have no patience for that.    

9437
25:56:19,082 --> 25:56:19,720
I apologized for you            
insulting me, you touching me.  
                             No.

9438
25:56:19,721 --> 25:56:20,359
              See, that's that--
              no, no.           
And I'm the bigger woman.       

9439
25:56:20,360 --> 25:56:20,998
                 Okay. Ha, okay.
So I'm a real woman who knows   
what really happened.           

9440
25:56:20,999 --> 25:56:21,637
                     Okay, okay.
You're out of control.          

9441
25:56:21,638 --> 25:56:22,276
                 Oh, my God.    
                 She's literally
                 delusional.    

9442
25:56:22,277 --> 25:56:22,915
So stop.                        
Get in control.                 

9443
25:56:22,916 --> 25:56:23,554
   This bitch is delusional, yo.
Okay!                           

9444
25:56:23,555 --> 25:56:24,193
   Farrah does not care abo anye

9445
25:56:24,194 --> 25:56:24,832
except for herself and s■■@@@@@.

25:56:25,472 --> 25:56:26,110
(Nurys)                         
Bitch, you're the trash.        

9448
25:56:26,111 --> 25:56:26,749
You kicked me in the vagina     
because I was having            

9449
25:56:26,750 --> 25:56:27,388
a conversation                  
with someone.                   

9450
25:56:27,389 --> 25:56:28,027
Like, (bleep) psychotic.        

9451
25:56:28,028 --> 25:56:28,666
         Get ahold of yourself, 
         out-of-control groupie.

9452
25:56:28,667 --> 25:56:29,305
What's wrong?                   
           No, she's still lying
           and is a trash can.  

9453
25:56:29,306 --> 25:56:29,944
  I know I'm a bigger person.   

9454
25:56:29,945 --> 25:56:30,583
                  She's a whore.

9455
25:56:30,584 --> 25:56:31,222
     Do I need to apologize     
           to someone           

9456
25:56:31,223 --> 25:56:31,861
  who put that on themselves,   
who caused that for themselves, 

9457
25:56:31,862 --> 25:56:32,500
   who (bleep) deserves worse   
       than what she got?       

9458
25:56:32,501 --> 25:56:33,139
              No.

     Whoo!                      
     Dessert time, people!      

9625
25:58:19,214 --> 25:58:19,852
        So they bring up        
      this big pink cake,       

9626
25:58:19,853 --> 25:58:20,491
   and I'm like, "Thank you?"   

9627
25:58:20,492 --> 25:58:21,130
We just heard a lot of people   
like to have their cake...      

9628
25:58:21,131 --> 25:58:21,769
                 And eat it too.

                   (bleep) that.

9629
25:58:21,770 --> 25:58:22,408
The exes already have a face on,
    and y'all just came from    
      the Shack of Secrets      

9630
25:58:22,409 --> 25:58:23,047
  and y'all looking at us like  
 y'all just seen a dead ghost.  

9631
25:58:23,048 --> 25:58:23,686
       Downstairs we saw        
       every conversation       

9632
25:58:23,687 --> 25:58:24,325

    I've never seen before.     

9635
25:58:25,604 --> 25:58:26,242
Farrah, you said that you didn't
 know that they hired a hooker, 
      calling me a hooker.      

9636
25:58:26,243 --> 25:58:26,881
       Are you (bleep)--        
I haven't said anything

9637
25:58:26,882 --> 25:58:27,520
           No, honey,           
       I am not a hooker.       
But you're a porn star!         

9638

       I am not a hooker.       

9639
25:58:28,160 --> 25:58:28,798
The next person                 
that calls me--                 
    Do not call me a hooker,    

9640
25:58:28,799 --> 25:58:29,437

       It wasn't like a--       
    she said it was a snipe.    

9817
26:00:21,902 --> 26:00:22,540
       It wasn't a snipe.       
It wasn't a snipe at all.       

9818
26:00:22,541 --> 26:00:23,179
   When you're in this house,   
        you kind of know

      But honestly, like,       
   what's she gonna look at?    

9821
26:00:24,458 --> 26:00:25,096
   You know what I'm saying?    

9822
26:00:25,097 --> 26:00:25,735
It's hard for me                
to deal with the house          
and all this                    

9823
26:00:25,736 --> 26:00:26,374
and me and you haven't          
gotten anything,                
like, resolved.                 
                       Resolved.

9824
26:00:26,375 --> 26:00:27,013

'cause it's like                

9825
26:00:27,014 --> 26:00:27,652
I'm over here dying inside.     

9826
26:00:27,653 --> 26:00:28,291

  a man to not be accountable

   Like, I need you to repent   
     to me like I'm Jesus.      

9829
26:00:29,570 --> 26:00:30,208
When are you gonna fight        
for me here                     

9830
26:00:30,209 --> 26:00:30,847

in (bleep) that don't           
(bleep) matter?                 

9831

are you gonna fight for me?     

9832
26:00:31,487 --> 26:00:32,125
             You don't even know
             what you want.     

9833
26:00:32,126 --> 26:00:32,764
  When we originally broke up,  
    she left me, literally.     

9834
26:00:32,765 --> 26:00:33,403
But now I feel like she kind of 
 wants the best of both worlds. 

9835
26:00:33,404 --> 26:00:34,042
The onlymatters

9836
26:00:34,043 --> 26:00:34,681
 can't strictly talk            
about me and you right now,     

9837
26:00:34,682 --> 26:00:35,320
then I will just go to bed.     
                    That's fine.

9838
26:00:35,321 --> 26:00:35,959
        Okay. Good-bye.         

9839
26:00:35,960 --> 26:00:36,598

9842

    Of course not, Janelle.     

9843

     on the chopping block.     

9907
26:01:19,412 --> 26:01:20,050
 It's 'cause she kicked my girl 
  in the vagina and she needs   
        to (bleep) off.

9920

        Correct, and none

9921

9923
26:01:29,636 --> 26:01:30,274

9924
26:01:30,275 --> 26:01:30,913
everyone's done                 
a couple things wrong,          
and at this point, like,        

9925
26:01:30,914 --> 26:01:31,552
it's like we're not all         
gonna come to one.              

9926
26:01:31,553 --> 26:01:32,191
I think we should all just vote 
what we think at this point.    

9927
26:01:32,192 --> 26:01:32,830
   So I'm just gonna go ahead   
 and crush Farrah just because  

9928
26:01:32,831 --> 26:01:33,469
      I feel like Farrah,       
  if you're gonna respect her,  
 she'll respectight back.       

9929
26:01:33,470 --> 26:01:34,108

     other than the people

9930
26:01:34,109 --> 26:01:34,747

you want her out.

26:04:54,116 --> 26:04:54,754
    WERE DIFFICULT FOR THEM.    

10244
26:04:54,755 --> 26:04:55,393
  GATES: MARCO'S PARENTS        
  STRUGGLED MIGHTILY TO MAKE IT 

10245
26:04:55,394 --> 26:04:56,032
   IN AMERICA, MOVING FROM NEW  
   YORK TO MIAMI TO LAS VEGAS,  

10246
26:04:56,033 --> 26:04:56,671
 WORKING IN CASINOS AND HOTELS. 

10247
26:04:56,672 --> 26:04:57,310
    IT WAS AN IMMENSE EFFORT.   

10248
26:04:57,311 --> 26:04:57,949
  BUT EVEN SO, THE COUPLE TOOK  
  GREAT CARE TO MAKE SURE THAT  

10249
26:04:57,950 --> 26:04:58,588
      THEIR CHILDREN DIDN'T     
      SEE THEIR EXPERIENCE      

10250
26:04:58,589 --> 26:04:59,227
         AS A LIABILITY.        

10251
26:04:59,228 --> 26:04:59,866
     RUBIO: I NEVER REMEMBER    
     GROWING UP FEELING LIKE    

10252
26:04:59,867 --> 26:05:00,505
    I WAS LIMITED BECAUSE MY    
     DAD WAS A BARTENDER AND    

10253
26:05:00,506 --> 26:05:01,144
     MY MOM WORKED AS A MAID    
     AT THE IMPERIAL PALACE.    

10254
26:05:01,145 --> 26:05:01,783
  SOMEHOW THEY WERE ABLE TO     
  INSTILL IN US THE BELIEF THAT 

10255
26:05:01,784 --> 26:05:02,422
     THERE WAS NOBODY WE        
     SAW ON TELEVISION THAT     

10256
26:05:02,423 --> 26:05:03,061
     WE COULDN'T BE ONE DAY.    

10257
26:05:03,062 --> 26:05:03,700
  GATES: THAT'S FABULOUS.       
  MY PARENTS WERE THE SAME WAY. 

10258
26:05:03,701 --> 26:05:04,339
     THERE WAS NOTHING THAT     
     WE COULD ASPIRE TO THAT    

10259
26:05:04,340 --> 26:05:04,978
      WE COULD NOT ACHIEVE.

26:05:04,979 --> 26:05:05,617
          RUBIO: YEAH.

         GATES: NOTHING.        

10262
26:05:06,257 --> 26:05:06,895
   RUBIO: THAT'S A REAL GIFT.   

10263
26:05:06,896 --> 26:05:07,534
  GATES: BUT WHERE DO YOU THINK 
  IT CAME FROM IN YOUR CASE?    

10264
26:05:07,535 --> 26:05:08,173
    RUBIO: I DON'T KNOW, UM.

 GATES: I MEAN IT'S KINDA       
 CRAZY WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT. 

10266
26:05:08,813 --> 26:05:09,451
   RUBIO: WELL I THINK IT WAS   
    JUST KIND OF THE POINT OF   

10267
26:05:09,452 --> 26:05:10,090
        MY PARENTS' LIFE.       

10268
26:05:10,091 --> 26:05:10,729
       THEY TRIED A LOT OF      
       DIFFERENT THINGS,        

10269
26:05:10,730 --> 26:05:11,368
  AND I THINK THEIR FEELING WAS 
 WE WOULD HAVE THE CHANCE TO DO 

10270
26:05:11,369 --> 26:05:12,007
       THINGS THEY NEVER        
       HAD A CHANCE TO DO,      

10271
26:05:12,008 --> 26:05:12,646
    BUT INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH,   
    THEY NEVER HAD A SPECIFIC   

10272
26:05:12,647 --> 26:05:13,285
   DREAM FOR US, THEY JUST      
   WANTED US TO HAVE A DREAM,   

10273
26:05:13,286 --> 26:05:13,924
      WHATEVER THAT WAS,

10274
26:05:13,925 --> 26:05:14,563

     DID INDEED FIND HIS OWN    

10275
26:05:14,564 --> 26:05:15,202
        DREAMS TO PURSUE.

   LATINOS IN THE U.S. SENATE.  

10279
26:05:17,120 --> 26:05:17,758
    LOOKING BACK, HE REMAINS    
    INTENSELY GRATEFUL TO HIS   

10280
26:05:17,759 --> 26:05:18,397
  PARENTS, AND SEES HIS SUCCESS 
  AS A VALIDATION OF THE CHOICE 

10281
26:05:18,398 --> 26:05:19,036
    THEY MADE IN IMMIGRATING,   
    AND OF THE NATION THEY

  YOU LIVE SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY 

10285
26:05:20,954 --> 26:05:21,592
    WON'T LET YOU BE WHO YOU

26:05:21,593 --> 26:05:22,231
        YOUR FAMILY ISN'T

   WORK NOT ON WHAT YOUR LAST

26:05:23,510 --> 26:05:24,148
   NAME IS OR WHERE, WHAT

     ON THE NATIONAL STAGE.     

10294
26:05:26,705 --> 26:05:27,343
       TULSI COMES FROM A       
       MILITARY FAMILY,         

10295
26:05:27,344 --> 26:05:27,982
        AND FOLLOWED THAT       
       SAME PATH HERSELF.       

10296
26:05:27,983 --> 26:05:28,621
     SHE JOINED THE ARMY        
     NATIONAL GUARD IN 2003,    

10297
26:05:28,622 --> 26:05:29,260
   WHEN SHE WAS 22 YEARS OLD.   

10298
26:05:29,261 --> 26:05:29,899
   THE NEXT YEAR, THE MAJORITY  
  OF HER UNIT WAS SELECTED FOR  

10299
26:05:29,900 --> 26:05:30,538
        SERVICE IN IRAQ,        
        BUT TULSI WASN'T,       

10300
26:05:30,539 --> 26:05:31,177
  SO SHE MADE A BOLD DECISION.  

10301
26:05:31,178 --> 26:05:31,816
  GABBARD: I KNEW VERY QUICKLY  
  THAT THERE WAS NO WAY THAT I  

10302
26:05:31,817 --> 26:05:32,455
  COULD STAY BACK IN            
  BEAUTIFUL HAWAII AS YOU KNOW,

10305
26:05:33,734 --> 26:05:34,372
   GABBARD: SO I VOLUNTEERED.   

10306
26:05:34,373 --> 26:05:35,011
    I CALLED MY                 
    COMMANDER AND I TOLD HIM.   

10307
26:05:35,012 --> 26:05:35,650
   I HAVE TO GO WITH YOU GUYS.  

10308
26:05:35,651 --> 26:05:36,289
     AND, AND HE SAID,          
     NO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO.     

10309
26:05:36,290 --> 26:05:36,928
   AND IT TOOK A FEW            
   CONVERSATIONS FOR ME TO GET  

10310
26:05:36,929 --> 26:05:37,567
   HIM TO UNDERSTAND THAT I     
   WAS NOT GOING TO STAY HOME.  

10311
26:05:37,568 --> 26:05:38,206
    GATES: TULSI WAS SENT TO    
    A BASE IN IRAQ NICKNAMED

  THE REALITIES OF WAR.

  GABBARD: IT REALLY SHOWS YOU  
  WHAT'S IMPORTANT IN LIFE AND,

26:05:41,402 --> 26:05:42,040
        UM, THE SMALL           
        THINGS FALL AWAY.

    GATES WHERE THE

  EVER-PRESENT REMINDER OF HOW  

10325
26:05:46,514 --> 26:05:47,152
 FRAGILE LIFE IS AND THAT OUR   
 TIME COULD COME AT ANY MOMENT, 

10326
26:05:47,153 --> 26:05:47,791
        SO MAKE IT COUNT.       

10327
26:05:47,792 --> 26:05:48,430
      DON'T TAKE                
      ANYTHING FOR GRANTED.     

10328
26:05:48,431 --> 26:05:49,069
  GATES: TULSI TOLD ME THAT HER 
 SERVICE WAS A MAJOR MOTIVATION 

10329
26:05:49,070 --> 26:05:49,708
       IN HER DECISION TO       
        RUN FOR CONGRESS,       

10330
26:05:49,709 --> 26:05:50,347

      THE COST OF THIS BE,      

10333
26:05:51,626 --> 26:05:52,264
       DEVASTATION TO THE       
       AMERICAN PEOPLE,         

10334
26:05:52,265 --> 26:05:52,903

        WHAT, FOR WHAT?         

10335
26:05:52,904 --> 26:05:53,542
 GATES: A NOTION THAT TRULY HIT 
  HOME WHEN SHE RETURNED TO HER 

10336
26:05:53,543 --> 26:05:54,181
 FAMILY, AND SAW HOW POWERFULLY 
 HER ABSENCE HAD AFFECTED THEM. 

10337
26:05:54,182 --> 26:05:54,820
    GABBARD: WHEN I CAME HOME   
    FROM MY FIRST DEPLOYMENT.   

10338
26:05:54,821 --> 26:05:55,459
      WE PROBABLY LANDED AT     
     3 OR 4 IN THE MORNING.     

10339
26:05:55,460 --> 26:05:56,098
    WE SAW THE SUN RISING AS    
    WE WERE MARCHING INTO UM,

26:05:56,738 --> 26:05:57,376
       ALL OF OUR FAMILIES      
       WERE GATHERED.           

10342
26:05:57,377 --> 26:05:58,015
  AND AS SOON AS THE GENERAL    
  SAID THAT WE WERE DISMISSED,  

10343
26:05:58,016 --> 26:05:58,654
  UH I RAN TO MY FAMILY AND MY  
  DAD WAS THE FIRST ONE THAT I  

10344
26:05:58,655 --> 26:05:59,293
 HUGGED AND UM, HE WAS SOBBING. 

10345
26:05:59,294 --> 26:05:59,932
       I DIDN'T, I DIDN'T       
       KNOW HOW, YOU KNOW,      

10346
26:05:59,933 --> 26:06:00,571
  I WAS SO FOCUSED IN MY WORLD  
  AND WHAT I WAS DOING I DIDN'T 

10347
26:06:00,572 --> 26:06:01,210
    FULLY REALIZE UNTIL THAT    
    MOMENT HOW ANXIOUS AND      

10348
26:06:01,211 --> 26:06:01,849
       STRESSED AND             
       WORRIED THEY WERE.       

10349
26:06:01,850 --> 26:06:02,488
      GATES: AFTER SPENDING     
      TIME WITH MY GUESTS,      

10350
26:06:02,489 --> 26:06:03,127
      I WAS STRUCK THAT         
      EACH HAD BEEN MOLDED      

10351
26:06:03,128 --> 26:06:03,766
   AND MOTIVATED BY ADVERSITY.  

10352
26:06:03,767 --> 26:06:04,405
  AS I DUG INTO THEIR ROOTS, I  
  FOUND THAT THEIR FAMILY TREES 

10353
26:06:04,406 --> 26:06:05,044
     WERE FILLED WITH PEOPLE    
     WHO SHARED THAT TRAIT.     

10354
26:06:05,045 --> 26:06:05,683
     BUT THEIR STORIES HAD      
     LARGELY BEEN FORGOTTEN.    

10355
26:06:05,684 --> 26:06:06,322
  IT WAS TIME TO UNEARTH THEM.  

10356
26:06:06,323 --> 26:06:06,961
    I STARTED WITH PAUL RYAN.   

10357
26:06:06,962 --> 26:06:07,600
    AS HIS NAME SUGGESTS, HIS   
    FATHER'S FAMILY IS IRISH,   

10358
26:06:07,601 --> 26:06:08,239
     AND PAUL IS WELL-VERSED    
     IN THEIR EXPERIENCE.       

10359

  HIS MOTHER'S ROOTS, HOWEVER,

  OR ANYTHING AT ALL ABOUT      
  THE DETAILS OF THEIR JOURNEY. 

10386
26:06:25,493 --> 26:06:26,131
     WE FOUND THE

10392
26:06:29,327 --> 26:06:29,965
   IN 1854, WE CAME TO AMERICA

    ABOUT TO GET EVEN BETTER.   

10407
26:06:38,912 --> 26:06:39,550
  ACCORDING TO JOSEPH, THE      
  HUTTERS CAME TO WISCONSIN TO  

10408
26:06:39,551 --> 26:06:40,189
  SETTLE IN SAUK COUNTY, WHERE  
  THERE WAS A GROWING COMMUNITY 

10409
26:06:40,190 --> 26:06:40,828
      OF GERMAN IMMIGRANTS.     

10410
26:06:40,829 --> 26:06:41,467

      THEY REACHED MADISON,     

10411
26:06:41,468 --> 26:06:42,106
      THEY WERE

10412
26:06:42,107 --> 26:06:42,745

    OVER 50 MILES AWAY!         

10413
26:06:42,746 --> 26:06:43,384
    THEY HAD NOTHING LEFT TO    
     SELL, SO THEY CONTINUED    

10414
26:06:43,385 --> 26:06:44,023
     THEIR JOURNEY, ON FOOT.    

10415
26:06:44,024 --> 26:06:44,662
     JOSEPH WAS ONLY SIX

10420
26:06:47,219 --> 26:06:47,857
  GATES: AND IF WE DO THE MATH, 
  JOSEPH'S MOTHER WAS LIKELY    

10421
26:06:47,858 --> 26:06:48,496
 PREGNANT WHEN THE FAMILY       
 IMMIGRATED AND WHEN THE FAMILY 

10422
26:06:48,497 --> 26:06:49,135
    WAS MAKING THAT 50          
    MILE WALK TO SAUK COUNTY.

26:07:21,725 --> 26:07:22,363
   RYAN: IT'S NEAT TO SEE WHAT  
   PEOPLE DO TO MAKE A BETTER   

10475
26:07:22,364 --> 26:07:23,002
   LIFE FOR THEMSELVES AND HOW  
   HARD IT WAS TO GET GOING IN  

10476
26:07:23,003 --> 26:07:23,641
       THIS COUNTY, TO          
       GET THINGS STARTED.      

10477
26:07:23,642 --> 26:07:24,280
      GATES: YEAH AND THEY      
      RISKED EVERYTHING.        

10478
26:07:24,281 --> 26:07:24,919
  RYAN: EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING. 

10479
26:07:24,920 --> 26:07:25,558
      GATES: AND THEY WERE      
      JUST GLAD TO BE HERE.     

10480
26:07:25,559 --> 26:07:26,197
   RYAN: THEY WALKED 50 MILES.

26:07:26,198 --> 26:07:26,836
     GATES: AND THEY            
     WALKED 50 MILES, YEAH.     

10482
26:07:26,837 --> 26:07:27,475
   RYAN: WHAT ARE THEY DOING,   
   HOW DID THEY DO THAT?        

10483
26:07:27,476 --> 26:07:28,114
        YEAH. IT'S NEAT.        

10484
26:07:28,115 --> 26:07:28,753
     GATES: IT'S INCREDIBLE.

10486
26:07:29,393 --> 26:07:30,031
      GATES: UNLIKE PAUL,       
      MARCO RUBIO KNOWS THE     

10487
26:07:30,032 --> 26:07:30,670
 IMMIGRANTS IN HIS FAMILY TREE. 

10488
26:07:30,671 --> 26:07:31,309
    THEY'RE HIS PARENTS, WHO    
    CAME TO THE UNITED STATES   

10489
26:07:31,310 --> 26:07:31,948
       FROM CUBA IN 1956.       

10490
26:07:31,949 --> 26:07:32,587
 BUT MARCO'S DEEPER ROOTS       
 WERE LARGELY A MYSTERY TO HIM. 

10491
26:07:32,588 --> 26:07:33,226
  AND AS WE BEGAN OUR RESEARCH, 
  WE SOON UNDERSTOOD WHY.       

10492
26:07:33,227 --> 26:07:33,865
 HIS FATHER, MARIO RUBIO REINA, 
 LOST BOTH OF HIS PARENTS BY    

10493
26:07:33,866 --> 26:07:34,504
   THE TIME HE WAS A TEENAGER,  
   AND ENDED UP LIVING ON THE   

10494
26:07:34,505 --> 26:07:35,143
       STREETS OF HAVANA.       

10495
26:07:35,144 --> 26:07:35,782
      A TRAUMA SO DEEP, IT      
      WAS RARELY DISCUSSED.     

10496
26:07:35,783 --> 26:07:36,421
  RUBIO: I KNOW VERY            
  LITTLE ABOUT HIS UPBRINGING.  

10497
26:07:36,422 --> 26:07:37,060
    I KNOW HIS MOTHER DIED      
    WHEN HE WAS VERY YOUNG OF   

10498
26:07:37,061 --> 26:07:37,699
       TUBERCULOSIS OR          
       SOME LUNG DISEASE.       

10499
26:07:37,700 --> 26:07:38,338
     AND THEN UH, HIS FATHER    
    AT SOME POINT REMARRIED,    

10500
26:07:38,339 --> 26:07:38,977
        AND UM, AND THEN,       

10501
26:07:38,978 --> 26:07:39,616
        WHEN HE WAS STILL       
        VERY YOUNG,             

10502
26:07:39,617 --> 26:07:40,255
   CERTAINLY BEFORE HE WAS 18,  

10503
26:07:40,256 --> 26:07:40,894
      HE MOVED OUT WITH ONE     
      OF HIS BROTHERS AND       

10504
26:07:40,895 --> 26:07:41,533
      LIVED SOMEWHERE ELSE.     

10505
26:07:41,534 --> 26:07:42,172
   YOU KNOW, THIS IS A GUY 14,  
   15 YEARS OF AGE ON HIS OWN.  

10506
26:07:42,173 --> 26:07:42,811
    GATES: AS IT TURNS OUT,     
    MARCO'S FATHER WASN'T THE   

10507
26:07:42,812 --> 26:07:43,450
    ONLY ONE IN HIS FAMILY TO   
    SUFFER SUCH LOSSES.         

10508
26:07:43,451 --> 26:07:44,089
  WE DISCOVERED THAT BOTH OF    
  MARIO'S PARENTS WERE ORPHANED 

10509
26:07:44,090 --> 26:07:44,728
  AT AN EARLY AGE, MEANING THAT 
  AT LEAST TWO GENERATIONS OF   

10510
26:07:44,729 --> 26:07:45,367
  MARCO'S ANCESTORS HAD TO FEND 
  FOR THEMSELVES AS CHILDREN.   

10511
26:07:45,368 --> 26:07:46,006
 RUBIO: YOU CAN BEGIN TO SEE    
 WHY SOME OF THESE STORIES WERE 

10512
26:07:46,007 --> 26:07:46,645
    NOT TOLD, ESPECIALLY THEY   
    DIDN'T HAVE, IF THEIR,      

10513
26:07:46,646 --> 26:07:47,284
     IF THESE KIDS WERE VERY    
    YOUNG WHEN THEIR PARENTS    

10514
26:07:47,285 --> 26:07:47,923
    DIED THEY JUST PROBABLY     
    DIDN'T KNOW AS MUCH ABOUT   

10515
26:07:47,924 --> 26:07:48,562
     THEIR PARENTS AND          
     COULDN'T PASS IT DOWN.     

10516
26:07:48,563 --> 26:07:49,201
      AND IT CERTAINLY          
      EXPLAINS A LOT ABOUT,     

10517
26:07:49,202 --> 26:07:49,840
        MY, MY FATHER           
        CERTAINLY WASN'T,       

10518
26:07:49,841 --> 26:07:50,479
  I DON'T THINK HE WAS ASHAMED  
  OF HIS FAMILY'S HISTORY,      

10519
26:07:50,480 --> 26:07:51,118
       HE JUST WASN'T A         
       PROMINENT FEATURE.       

10520
26:07:51,119 --> 26:07:51,757
       YOU WOULD THINK HE       
       KIND OF, YOU KNOW,       

10521
26:07:51,758 --> 26:07:52,396
 JUST APPEARED ON THE EARTH ONE 
 DAY AND THERE WAS NOTHING THAT 

10522
26:07:52,397 --> 26:07:53,035
    CAME BEFORE IT OTHER        
    THAN VERY VAGUE NOTIONS.    

10523
26:07:53,036 --> 26:07:53,674
     GATES: AND WHO WANTS TO    
     REVISIT ALL THAT PAIN?     

10524
26:07:53,675 --> 26:07:54,313
    RUBIO: YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.    

10525
26:07:54,314 --> 26:07:54,952
       GATES: THAT'S SAD.       

10526
26:07:54,953 --> 26:07:55,591

10527
26:07:55,592 --> 26:07:56,230
 GATES: I WANTED TO RECOVER THE 
 STORIES THAT MARCO'S FAMILY    

10528
26:07:56,231 --> 26:07:56,869
        HAD LOST AMIDST         
        ALL THIS TRAGEDY.       

10529
26:07:56,870 --> 26:07:57,508
     ONE STOOD OUT AS           
     ESPECIALLY MEANINGFUL.     

10530
26:07:57,509 --> 26:07:58,147
    IT CONCERNS HIS             
    THIRD GREAT-GRANDFATHER,    

10531
26:07:58,148 --> 26:07:58,786

26:07:58,787 --> 26:07:59,425

     1760 IN SEVILLE, SPAIN.

26:07:59,426 --> 26:08:00,064
       JOSE'S BIRTHPLACE        
       WAS NOT UNEXPECTED,      

10534
26:08:00,065 --> 26:08:00,703
       AS MANY CUBANS HAVE      
       SPANISH ANCESTRY,        

10535
26:08:00,704 --> 26:08:01,342
     BUT HIS OCCUPATION TOOK    
     BOTH OF US BY SURPRISE.    

10536
26:08:01,343 --> 26:08:01,981
      RECORDS SHOW THAT HE      
      RECEIVED A LAW DEGREE     

10537

     WE WAITED LONG ENOUGH.     

10544
26:08:06,455 --> 26:08:07,093
    THAT'S UNREAL.

  HEIGHTS THAT HIS DESCENDENT   

10558
26:08:15,401 --> 26:08:16,039

   CAREER IN GOVERNMENT WAS     

10559
26:08:16,040 --> 26:08:16,678
   MARKED BY ONE

26:08:33,932 --> 26:08:34,570
       LIVING UNTIL HE WAS      
       ABOUT 70 YEARS OLD.      

10588
26:08:34,571 --> 26:08:35,209
    HIS SON, MARCO'S            
    GREAT-GREAT-GRANDFATHER,    

10589
26:08:35,210 --> 26:08:35,848
  ALSO TOOK UP GOVERNMENT WORK, 
  SERVING IN THE PAY CORPS OF   

10590
26:08:35,849 --> 26:08:36,487
        THE SPANISH ARMY.       

10591
26:08:36,488 --> 26:08:37,126
    SURVEYING THEIR LIVES,      
    MARCO WONDERED HOW THESE    

10592
26:08:37,127 --> 26:08:37,765
       ANCESTORS MAY HAVE       
       INFLUENCED HIM,          

10593
26:08:37,766 --> 26:08:38,404
     EVEN THOUGH THEIR          
     STORIES HAD BEEN LOST.     

10594
26:08:38,405 --> 26:08:39,043
  RUBIO: THOSE CAMPAIGNS        
  THAT I RAN MY DAD LOVED THEM, 

10595
26:08:39,044 --> 26:08:39,682
 I MEAN HE LOVED BEING INVOLVED 
 IN IT AND LOVED DOING IT.      

10596
26:08:39,683 --> 26:08:40,321
       I CAN'T IMAGINE HE       
        KNEW ANY OF THIS,       

10597
26:08:40,322 --> 26:08:40,960
      LIKE NO ONE'S EVER        
      TOLD US ANY OF THIS.      

10598
26:08:40,961 --> 26:08:41,599
    SO IT JUST KINDA            
    TELLS YOU THAT SOMEWHERE,   

10599
26:08:41,600 --> 26:08:42,238
  YOU KNOW, IN, IN THEIR BLOOD  
  BACK THEN IT WAS SOMEONE WHO  

10600
26:08:42,239 --> 26:08:42,877
  CARED ABOUT AND WAS INVOLVED  
  IN GOVERNMENT SERVICE AND,    

10601
26:08:42,878 --> 26:08:43,516
    AND THEN THERE WAS THESE    
    THINGS THAT MADE IT         

10602
26:08:43,517 --> 26:08:44,155
      IMPOSSIBLE FOR THREE      
      GENERATIONS TO DO IT,     

10603
26:08:44,156 --> 26:08:44,794
    AND THEN SUDDENLY YOU       
    PUT SOMEONE IN THE RIGHT    

10604
26:08:44,795 --> 26:08:45,433
      ENVIRONMENT AND THEY      
      WIND UP, YOU KNOW,        

10605
26:08:45,434 --> 26:08:46,072
        IN THE US SENATE.       

10606
26:08:46,073 --> 26:08:46,711
    THAT'S JUST UNBELIEVABLE.   

10607
26:08:46,712 --> 26:08:47,350
            GOD. WOW.

        A CALL TO SERVE.        

10611
26:08:49,268 --> 26:08:49,906
  INDEED, THE VERY REASON THAT  
   THE GABBARD FAMILY ENDED UP  

10612
26:08:49,907 --> 26:08:50,545
     IN THE PACIFIC AT ALL      
     LIES WITH THE MILITARY.

10614
26:08:51,185 --> 26:08:51,823
    CAME TO SAMOA AS A SAILOR   
    WITH THE U.S. NAVY.         

10615
26:08:51,824 --> 26:08:52,462
   AND WHILE ON LEAVE, HE       
   VISITED THE ISLAND OF APIA,  

10616
26:08:52,463 --> 26:08:53,101
 WHERE HE MET A LOCAL RESIDENT. 

10617

10632
26:09:02,687 --> 26:09:03,325
  THE NAVY WAS THE ONLY         
  REASON THAT HE WAS IN SAMOA,

  RIGHT BEFORE IT WAS DESTROYED

26:10:06,587 --> 26:10:07,225
       COMPLETELY IT HAS        
       CHANGED EVERYTHING.      

10733

   I MEAN HOUSES THAT I SAW,    
   FARMS THAT I SAW DURING THE  

10734

        FIRST WEEK OF THE       
        ERUPTION NOW ARE,       

10735
26:10:08,504 --> 26:10:09,142
  IT'S LIKE THEY NEVER EXISTED. 

10736
26:10:09,143 --> 26:10:09,781
 GATES: THE VOLCANO ON CHARLES' 
  ISLAND CONTINUED TO ERUPT FOR 

10737
26:10:09,782 --> 26:10:10,420
    SIX YEARS, AND DESTROYED    
    MUCH OF WHAT HE OWNED.      

10738
26:10:10,421 --> 26:10:11,059
   BUT TULSI'S

       GATES: STERN STUFF.      

10747
26:10:16,172 --> 26:10:16,810
   GABBARD: TRULY A TOUGH GUY.  

10748
26:10:16,811 --> 26:10:17,449
  GATES: YEAH. DOES THIS SOUND  
  LIKE ANYBODY IN YOUR FAMILY?  

10749
26:10:17,450 --> 26:10:18,088
        GABBARD: OH, YES.       

10750
26:10:18,089 --> 26:10:18,727
       GATES: PRETTY COOL.

26:10:18,728 --> 26:10:19,366
     GABBARD: YES.              
     THAT'S REALLY SPECIAL.     

10752
26:10:19,367 --> 26:10:20,005
   GATES: WE HAD ALREADY        
   TAKEN PAUL RYAN BACK TO HIS  

10753
26:10:20,006 --> 26:10:20,644
    GREAT-GREAT-GRANDFATHER,    
    JOSEPH HUTTER,              

10754
26:10:20,645 --> 26:10:21,283
       A GERMAN IMMIGRANT       
       WHO FOUNDED A            

10755
26:10:21,284 --> 26:10:21,922
      CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS     
      IN WISCONSIN.             

10756
26:10:21,923 --> 26:10:22,561
  NOW, WE WANTED TO GO FURTHER  
  ON THIS LINE, TO SEE WHERE    

10757
26:10:22,562 --> 26:10:23,200
       EXACTLY THE HUTTER       
       FAMILY ORIGINATED,       

10758
26:10:23,201 --> 26:10:23,839
 AND TRY TO LEARN WHY THEY      
 MADE THEIR JOURNEY TO AMERICA. 

10759
26:10:23,840 --> 26:10:24,478
    THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT    
    HAVE LONG ANIMATED PAUL.    

10760
26:10:24,479 --> 26:10:25,117
   AS, GROWING UP, HIS          
   GERMAN ROOTS WERE NEVER AS   

10761
26:10:25,118 --> 26:10:25,756
       MUCH-DISCUSSED AS        
       HIS IRISH HERITAGE.      

10762
26:10:25,757 --> 26:10:26,395
     RYAN: I ALWAYS WONDERED    
     WHY THEY IMMIGRATED.       

10763
26:10:26,396 --> 26:10:27,034
         I DIDN'T KNOW.         

10764
26:10:27,035 --> 26:10:27,673
        BECAUSE I KNOW          
        THE FAMINE IRISH.       

10765
26:10:27,674 --> 26:10:28,312
     I KNOW THE IRISH STORY.    

10766
26:10:28,313 --> 26:10:28,951
     THAT'S A PRETTY            
     SIMPLE STORY, YOU KNOW.    

10767
26:10:28,952 --> 26:10:29,590
       GATES: YEAH, SURE.       

10768
26:10:29,591 --> 26:10:30,229
    RYAN: BUT I NEVER REALLY    
    KNEW THE BAVARIAN STORY,    

10769
26:10:30,230 --> 26:10:30,868
      BUT I DON'T KNOW IF       
      YOU KNOW THAT OR NOT.     

10770
26:10:30,869 --> 26:10:31,507
     YOU'RE GONNA GET THERE.    

10771
26:10:31,508 --> 26:10:32,146
      GATES: WAIT AND SEE.      

10772
26:10:32,147 --> 26:10:32,785
      RYAN: I HAVE NO CLUE.     
      I DON'T WHY.              

10773
26:10:32,786 --> 26:10:33,424
  GATES: TRACING PAUL'S FAMILY  
  IN GERMANY WOULD PROVE TO     

10774
26:10:33,425 --> 26:10:34,063
     BE A SUBSTANTIAL TASK.     

10775
26:10:34,064 --> 26:10:34,702
  WE KNEW THAT JOSEPH HUTTER    
ARRIVED IN NEW YORK IN 1854,    

10776
26:10:34,703 --> 26:10:35,341
    BUT HIS ARRIVAL RECORD      
    DIDN'T NAME HIS HOMETOWN.   

10777
26:10:35,342 --> 26:10:35,980
  SO ALL WE HAD TO GO ON WAS A  
  FAMILY STORY THAT THE HUTTERS 

10778
26:10:35,981 --> 26:10:36,619
  ORIGINALLY CAME FROM BAVARIA. 

10779
26:10:36,620 --> 26:10:37,258
 FORTUNATELY, BAVARIAN CHURCHES 
 KEEP VERY GOOD RECORDS.

   RYAN: HOW DID YOU GET THAT?  

10790
26:10:43,649 --> 26:10:44,287
  YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.  

10791

10793
26:10:45,566 --> 26:10:46,204
   GATES: WE NOW KNEW THAT      
   PAUL'S ANCESTORS CAME FROM   

10794
26:10:46,205 --> 26:10:46,843
  HOCHABRUNN, A VILLAGE ON

10795
26:10:46,844 --> 26:10:47,482
 WALDMUCHEN IN EASTERN BAVARIA. 

10796
26:10:47,483 --> 26:10:48,121
 AND THIS ALLOWED US TO PROVIDE 
 SOME CONTEXT TO HIS FAMILY'S   

10797
26:10:48,122 --> 26:10:48,760
      DECISION TO EMIGRATE.

    HUTTERS LEFT, IN 1854,      

10799
26:10:49,400 --> 26:10:50,038
  MOST OF HOCHABRUNN'S          
  POPULATION WERE TRADESPEOPLE

10802
26:10:51,317 --> 26:10:51,955
    THEY LEFT LITTLE EVIDENCE   
    OF THEIR LIVES BEHIND,      

10803
26:10:51,956 --> 26:10:52,594

26:12:13,109 --> 26:12:13,747
     ABOUT YOU KNOW, THE        
     TACTICS AND THE BATTLES    

10931
26:12:13,748 --> 26:12:14,386
     THAT WERE FOUGHT THERE.    

10932
26:12:14,387 --> 26:12:15,025
  GATES: AND IT NEVER OCCURRED  
  TO YOU THAT ONE OF YOUR       

10933
26:12:15,026 --> 26:12:15,664
    ANCESTORS COULD BE THERE.   

10934
26:12:15,665 --> 26:12:16,303
       GABBARD: GOSH, NO.       

10935
26:12:16,304 --> 26:12:16,942
     GATES: THAT'S AMAZING.     

10936
26:12:16,943 --> 26:12:17,581
      THAT IS AMAZING THAT      
      YOU'VE BEEN THERE.        

10937
26:12:17,582 --> 26:12:18,220
    GABBARD: IT WAS COOL JUST   
    TO BE THERE AND KIND OF     

10938
26:12:18,221 --> 26:12:18,859
    WALK THROUGH THOSE          
    FOOTSTEPS THAT THEY TOOK,   

10939
26:12:18,860 --> 26:12:19,498
   BUT UM, NO, I, THE THOUGHT   
   NEVER CROSSED MY MIND.       

10940
26:12:19,499 --> 26:12:20,137
      GATES: THE ATLANTA        
      CAMPAIGN WOULD PROVE      

10941
26:12:20,138 --> 26:12:20,776
     A SPECTACULAR SUCCESS.     

10942
26:12:20,777 --> 26:12:21,415
  BUT IT CAME AT A HEAVY COST.  

10943
26:12:21,416 --> 26:12:22,054
    THE UNION WAS OPPOSED BY    
    ONE OF THE LARGEST ARMIES   

10944
26:12:22,055 --> 26:12:22,693
       IN THE CONFEDERACY.      

10945
26:12:22,694 --> 26:12:23,332
    AND THE TWO FORCES SOON     
    FACED OFF AT A SMALL TOWN   

10946
26:12:23,333 --> 26:12:23,971
       IN NORTHERN GEORGIA      
       KNOWN AS RESACA.         

10947
26:12:23,972 --> 26:12:24,610
     FOR TWO DAYS, THE UNION    
     STRUGGLED TO DRIVE THE     

10948
26:12:24,611 --> 26:12:25,249
  CONFEDERATES FROM THE FIELD,  
  FIGHTING ON TERRAIN THAT WAS  

10949
26:12:25,250 --> 26:12:25,888
    ILL-SUITED FOR AN ATTACK.   

10950
26:12:25,889 --> 26:12:26,527
      LEWIS'S REGIMENT WAS      
       ON THE FRONT LINES.      

10951
26:12:26,528 --> 26:12:27,166
  WE FOUND A NEWSPAPER ARTICLE, 

10952
26:12:27,167 --> 26:12:27,805
       WRITTEN JUST WEEKS       
        AFTER THE BATTLE,       

10953
26:12:27,806 --> 26:12:28,444
       THAT DESCRIBES           
       WHAT THEY ENDURED.

   IN ATTEMPTING TO             
   CHARGE THE REBELS IN FRONT,  

10956
26:12:29,723 --> 26:12:30,361
     WERE COMPELLED TO WADE     

10957
26:12:30,362 --> 26:12:31,000
  A CREEK WAIST DEEP, WHICH     
  RAN AT THE FOOT OF THE BLUFF; 

10958
26:12:31,001 --> 26:12:31,639
   AND THEN ACROSS A            
   VALLEY FILLED WITH DITCHES,  

10959
26:12:31,640 --> 26:12:32,278
     FULLY EXPOSED TO A FIRE

       NEVER DID MEN GO TO      
      WORK MORE GALLANTLY,      

10961
26:12:32,918 --> 26:12:33,556
   OR CONTEST MORE NOBLY; BUT   
    THEY COULD NOT ACCOMPLISH   

10962
26:12:33,557 --> 26:12:34,195
      IMPOSSIBILITIES, AND,     
      AFTER SEVERE LOSS,        

10963
26:12:34,196 --> 26:12:34,834
   WERE OBLIGED TO WITHDRAW."   

10964
26:12:34,835 --> 26:12:35,473
    GATES: COULD YOU IMAGINE?   

10965
26:12:35,474 --> 26:12:36,112
      GABBARD: IT'S TOUGH.      

10966
26:12:36,113 --> 26:12:36,751
 GATES: NOW, WE DON'T KNOW      
 EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO LEWIS 

10967
26:12:36,752 --> 26:12:37,390
   IN THAT BATTLE, BUT HIS      
   REGIMENT WAS ASSAULTING THE  

10968
26:12:37,391 --> 26:12:38,029
    VERY SAME CENTER STRETCH

10969
26:12:38,030 --> 26:12:38,668
   DESCRIBED IN THAT ARTICLE.   

10970
26:12:38,669 --> 26:12:39,307
   HE AND HIS COMRADES LIKELY   
   DESCENDED A STEEP RIDGE,     

10971
26:12:39,308 --> 26:12:39,946
  AND THEN CROSSED A CREEK      
  AND SCALED AN ALMOST VERTICAL 

10972
26:12:39,947 --> 26:12:40,585
  SLOPE WHERE THE CONFEDERATES  
  HAD DUG EARTHWORKS,           

10973
26:12:40,586 --> 26:12:41,224

10977
26:12:43,142 --> 26:12:43,780
       HE WAS ON THE LINE.      

10978

    FARTHER THAN I KNEW.

10986
26:12:48,893 --> 26:12:49,531
      BUT SOON FACED AN         
      EVEN GREATER ORDEAL.      

10987
26:12:49,532 --> 26:12:50,170
       JUST DAYS AFTER THE      
      BATTLE, HE TOOK ILL,      

10988
26:12:50,171 --> 26:12:50,809
        AND WAS SENT TO A       
        FIELD HOSPITAL.         

10989
26:12:50,810 --> 26:12:51,448
    HE NEVER FULLY RECOVERED.   

10990
26:12:51,449 --> 26:12:52,087
    OVER THE NEXT SIX MONTHS,   
    LOUIS WAS TREATED IN FOUR   

10991

 FROM STOMACH AILMENTS THAT     

10992
26:12:52,727 --> 26:12:53,365

        BUT OUR SEARCH          
        LED US ELSEWHERE.       

11045
26:13:26,594 --> 26:13:27,232
      WE STARTED WITH           
      MARCO'S GRANDFATHER,      

11046
26:13:27,233 --> 26:13:27,871
  PEDRO GARCIA, A MAN WHOSE     
  LIFE WAS MARKED BY HARDSHIP.  

11047
26:13:27,872 --> 26:13:28,510
    RUBIO: MY GRANDFATHER HAD   
    AN UP OR DOWN EXISTENCE.    

11048
26:13:28,511 --> 26:13:29,149
  YOU KNOW, HE AT ONE POINT HAD 
  A PRETTY GOOD JOB WORKING IN  

11049
26:13:29,150 --> 26:13:29,788
   A, FOR THE RAILROAD COMPANY  
   OR WHATEVER IT WAS AND       

11050
26:13:29,789 --> 26:13:30,427
     THEN HE LOST THAT JOB,     
     AND THEN HE STRUGGLED.     

11051
26:13:30,428 --> 26:13:31,066
   HE HAD BEEN UH, HANDICAPPED  
   AS A BOY WITH POLIO.         

11052
26:13:31,067 --> 26:13:31,705
  AND THERE WERE TIMES WHERE HE 
  REALLY STRUGGLED TO PROVIDE   

11053
26:13:31,706 --> 26:13:32,344
     FOR THEM BECAUSE           
     PHYSICALLY HE COULDN'T,    

11054
26:13:32,345 --> 26:13:32,983
  YOU KNOW, DO SOME OF THE WORK 
  THAT OTHER PEOPLE COULD DO.   

11055
26:13:32,984 --> 26:13:33,622
GATES: PEDRO IMMIGRATED TO      
AMERICA FROM CUBA IN THE 1950S. 

11056
26:13:33,623 --> 26:13:34,261
     MARCO KNEW HIM, AND        
     REMEMBERS HIM FONDLY AS    

11057
26:13:34,262 --> 26:13:34,900
     A MAN WHO LOVED HISTORY    
    AND LOVED STORY-TELLING.    

11058
26:13:34,901 --> 26:13:35,539
     BUT PEDRO RARELY SPOKE     
     ABOUT HIS CHILDHOOD,       

11059
26:13:35,540 --> 26:13:36,178
     AND MARCO KNOWS NEXT TO    
    NOTHING ABOUT HIS ROOTS.    

11060
26:13:36,179 --> 26:13:36,817
    RUBIO: I JUST KNOW HE WAS   
    ONE OF A LOT OF KIDS AND,   

11061
26:13:36,818 --> 26:13:37,456
     AND YOU KNOW, THE STORY    
     ALWAYS WAS HIS PARENTS,    

11062
26:13:37,457 --> 26:13:38,095
       I'M NOT SURE             
       WERE EVEN MARRIED.       

11063
26:13:38,096 --> 26:13:38,734
       GATES: MARCO, THEY       
       HAD 17 CHILDREN.         

11064
26:13:38,735 --> 26:13:39,373
      RUBIO: ALL FROM HER?      

11065
26:13:39,374 --> 26:13:40,012
      GATES: ALL FROM HER.      

11066
26:13:40,013 --> 26:13:40,651
  RUBIO: THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE. 

11067
26:13:40,652 --> 26:13:41,290
    GATES: THAT'S HARD WORK.    

11068
26:13:41,291 --> 26:13:41,929
          RUBIO: YEAH.          

11069
26:13:41,930 --> 26:13:42,568
     GATES: DO YOU HAVE ANY     
     IDEA WHERE THIS PART OF    

11070
26:13:42,569 --> 26:13:43,207
     YOUR FAMILY CAME FROM?     

11071
26:13:43,208 --> 26:13:43,846
         RUBIO: I DON'T.        

11072
26:13:43,847 --> 26:13:44,485
   WE ARE NOW AT THE LIMITS OF  
   MY KNOWLEDGE OF MY FAMILY'S  

11073
26:13:44,486 --> 26:13:45,124

   LIMITS OF MARCO'S KNOWLEDGE  

11075
26:13:45,764 --> 26:13:46,402
       REQUIRED SOME LUCK.      

11076
26:13:46,403 --> 26:13:47,041
   WE WERE ABLE TO LEARN VERY   
   LITTLE ABOUT PEDRO'S FATHER  

11077
26:13:47,042 --> 26:13:47,680
  CARLOS, AND WE COULD ONLY     
  TRACE HIS MOTHER RAMONA BACK  

11078
26:13:47,681 --> 26:13:48,319
  ONE GENERATION, TO THE 1850S. 

11079
26:13:48,320 --> 26:13:48,958
  BUT TURNING TO PEDRO'S WIFE,

      RODRÍGUEZ Y CHIROLDE,     

11081
26:13:49,598 --> 26:13:50,236
     WE WERE ABLE TO GO MUCH    
     FURTHER BACK IN TIME.      

11082
26:13:50,237 --> 26:13:50,875
     MANY OF HER ANCESTORS      
     LIVED IN PINAR DEL RÍO,    

11083
26:13:50,876 --> 26:13:51,514

     TAKING HER ROOTS           
     BACK ALMOST 300 YEARS.     

11086
26:13:52,793 --> 26:13:53,431
  MEANING MARCO RUBIO'S FAMILY  
  HAS LIVED IN CUBA FOR MUCH    

11087
26:13:53,432 --> 26:13:54,070
  LONGER THAN HE EVER DREAMED.

  YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE NAME OF

     AMAZING, IT REALLY IS.

  NO ONE CAN SAY I'M NOT CUBAN.

  SEE THAT HIS MATERNAL ROOTS   

11108
26:14:06,851 --> 26:14:07,489
     RAN SO DEEPLY IN CUBA,     
      HE'D EXPECTED THEM TO     

11109
26:14:07,490 --> 26:14:08,128

       HIS FATHER'S SIDE.       

11111
26:14:08,768 --> 26:14:09,406
 BUT HE WAS EVEN MORE SURPRISED 
 BY WHAT RECORDS REVEALED ABOUT 

11112
26:14:09,407 --> 26:14:10,045
 HIS THIRD GREAT-GRANDFATHER, A 
  MAN NAMED JUAN JOSÉ CHIROLES. 

11113
26:14:10,046 --> 26:14:10,684
    HE WAS A LANDOWNER.         
    HE OWNED A TOBACCO FARM.

 OWNED ROUGHLY 30 ACRES OF LAND

     TOBACCO, CORN AND RICE,    

11121
26:14:15,158 --> 26:14:15,796
  BUT THAT WASN'T ALL HE OWNED. 

11122
26:14:15,797 --> 26:14:16,435
  WE FOUND THE BAPTISMAL RECORD

11137
26:14:25,382 --> 26:14:26,020
     SO I DIDN'T THINK

26:14:27,299 --> 26:14:27,937
 I MEAN IF YOU BAPTIZED THEM    
 IT'S BECAUSE YOU BELIEVED THEY 

11141
26:14:27,938 --> 26:14:28,576
     HAD A SOUL AND WERE        
     CREATED IN GOD'S IMAGE.    

11142
26:14:28,577 --> 26:14:29,215
       HOW THEN COULD           
       YOU OWN THEM AS A,

11164

11169

11170
26:14:46,469 --> 26:14:47,107
      THIS JUST SHOWS HOW

26:14:47,747 --> 26:14:48,385
   GABBARD: THIS IS             
   FURTHER PROOF AND EVIDENCE.  

11173
26:14:48,386 --> 26:14:49,024
  WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR LIVES AND 
  THOSE WHO'VE COME BEFORE US   

11174
26:14:49,025 --> 26:14:49,663
      WE'RE ALL CONNECTED.

11176

 TURNING TO MARCO RUBIO, WE HAD 
 ONE FINAL REVELATION TO SHARE. 

11177
26:14:50,942 --> 26:14:51,580
      WHEN WE ANALYZED HIS      
      MITOCHONDRIAL DNA,        

11178
26:14:51,581 --> 26:14:52,219
  A GENETIC FINGERPRINT PASSED  
  DOWN UNCHANGED FROM MOTHER TO 

11179
26:14:52,220 --> 26:14:52,858
  CHILD FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS, 
  WE FOUND THAT HIS DIRECT

26:14:52,859 --> 26:14:53,497
        MATERNAL LINE WAS       
        NATIVE AMERICAN.        

11181

11184

 THE NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATION 

11185
26:14:56,054 --> 26:14:56,692
    IN PINAR DEL RÍO MIGRATED   
   FROM THE YUCATÁN PENINSULA   

11186
26:14:56,693 --> 26:14:57,331
         ABOUT 4000 BC.

11196
26:15:03,083 --> 26:15:03,721
     AMERICAN DESCENDS FROM     
     SOMEONE WHO WASN'T BORN    

11197
26:15:03,722 --> 26:15:04,360
     IN OUR COUNTRY, BUT HAS    
     EMBRACED, AND ENRICHED     

11198
26:15:04,361 --> 26:15:04,999
        IT JUST THE SAME.       

11199
26:15:05,000 --> 26:15:05,638
  WE'D SEEN THIS OVER AND OVER  
   IN MY GUESTS' FAMILY TREES,  

11200
26:15:05,639 --> 26:15:06,277
    AND ITS RELEVANCE WASN'T    
    LOST ON ANY OF THEM,        

11201
26:15:06,278 --> 26:15:06,916
  LEAST OF ALL ON MARCO RUBIO.  

11202
26:15:06,917 --> 26:15:07,555
    RUBIO: THIS REALLY BRINGS   
   IT TO LIGHT ABOUT AMERICA.   

11203
26:15:07,556 --> 26:15:08,194
    IN AMERICA WE DON'T         
    HAVE A COMMON ETHNICITY,    

11204
26:15:08,195 --> 26:15:08,833
       A COMMON LANGUAGE.       

11205
26:15:08,834 --> 26:15:09,472
  I MEAN THERE'S, THERE ARE     
  COUNTRIES IN THIS WORLD THAT  

11206
26:15:09,473 --> 26:15:10,111
     DOING THE DNA OF THE       
     POPULATION WOULD NOT BE    

11207
26:15:10,112 --> 26:15:10,750
  VERY COMPLICATED, EVERYONE AT 
  SOME POINT IS PRETTY SIMILAR. 

11208
26:15:10,751 --> 26:15:11,389
      GATES: LIKE ICELAND.      

11209
26:15:11,390 --> 26:15:12,028

    SO, I, AND OTHER PLACES.    

11210
26:15:12,029 --> 26:15:12,667
  AND, BUT IN AMERICA WE'RE,    
  IT'S NOT JUST A GENETIC MIX.  

11211
26:15:12,668 --> 26:15:13,306
    WE COME FROM DIFFERENT      
    CONTINENTS AND DIFFERENT    

11212

    WE COME FROM EVERYWHERE.    

11214
26:15:14,585 --> 26:15:15,223
  BUT I'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT THE 
  ONE THING WE HAVE IN COMMON   

11215
26:15:15,224 --> 26:15:15,862
      IN ALL OF OUR DNA AS      
       AMERICANS IS WE ALL      

11216
26:15:15,863 --> 26:15:16,501
    DESCEND FROM GO-GETTERS.    

11217
26:15:16,502 --> 26:15:17,140
     EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US     
     DESCENDS FROM SOMEONE      

11218
26:15:17,141 --> 26:15:17,779
   WHO OVERCAME INCREDIBLE      
   ADVERSITY, WHETHER IT WAS    

11219
26:15:17,780 --> 26:15:18,418
      UH, THE JOURNEY THAT      
      BROUGHT THEM INTO,        

11220
26:15:18,419 --> 26:15:19,057
 INTO SLAVERY AND THEN SURVIVED 
 IT IN BRUTAL CONDITIONS FOR    

11221
26:15:19,058 --> 26:15:19,696
   HUNDREDS OF YEARS, WHETHER   
   IT'S SOMEONE WHO CAME LAST   

11222
26:15:19,697 --> 26:15:20,335
  WEEK FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY     
  IN SEARCH OF A BETTER LIFE,   

11223
26:15:20,336 --> 26:15:20,974
      OR SOMEONE WHO CAME       
      200 YEARS AGO IN          

11224
26:15:20,975 --> 26:15:21,613

11225
26:15:21,614 --> 26:15:22,252
  OUR COMMON DNA IN AMERICA IS  
  WE ALMOST ALL DESCEND FROM A  

11226
26:15:22,253 --> 26:15:22,891
 GO-GETTER, SOMEONE WHO REFUSED 
  TO ACCEPT THE LIMITS PUT UPON 

11227
26:15:22,892 --> 26:15:23,530
  THEM IN THE OLD WORLD, AND    
  SO THEY REACHED FOR THIS ONE  

11228
26:15:23,531 --> 26:15:24,169
   PLACE WHERE THEY WERE GONNA  
   BE JUDGED BY WHO THEY WERE,  

11229

    NOT WHERE THEY CAME FROM.

that could backfire.            

12803
26:32:09,956 --> 26:32:10,594
    Shiloh could                
   tell Kristina.               

12804
26:32:10,595 --> 26:32:11,233
Kristina -- she could dig in    
       so much harder.          

12805
26:32:11,234 --> 26:32:11,872
  No way.                       
                All right.      
             Oh, I hate this.   

12806
26:32:11,873 --> 26:32:12,511
                 I hate this    
                for everyone.   

12807
26:32:12,512 --> 26:32:13,150
             You and Jason just 
             got back together. 

12808
26:32:13,151 --> 26:32:13,789
           I'd like to wring    
      Shiloh's enlightened neck.

12809
26:32:13,790 --> 26:32:14,428
     I've got to pretend        
to hang on to his every word.   

12810
26:32:14,429 --> 26:32:15,067
                    God.        

12811
26:32:15,068 --> 26:32:15,706
 Yeah.                          
           What if he catches on
        that you're playing him?

12812
26:32:15,707 --> 26:32:16,345
Well, I've -- I-I-I have        
   thought about this,          

12813
26:32:16,346 --> 26:32:16,984
and I've got a few things       
      going for me.             

12814
26:32:16,985 --> 26:32:17,623
      One: I am                 
 an experienced con.            

12815
26:32:17,624 --> 26:32:18,262
Two: Shiloh expects women       
    to fall for him,            

12816
26:32:18,263 --> 26:32:18,901
 including Kristina.            

12817
26:32:18,902 --> 26:32:19,540
      I mean, and               
all these other girls,          

12818
26:32:19,541 --> 26:32:20,179
 they're almost like            
    his groupies,               

12819
26:32:20,180 --> 26:32:20,818
   and he assumes               
 he can pull me in.             

12820
26:32:20,819 --> 26:32:21,457
  All I have to do              
   is play along.               

12821
26:32:21,458 --> 26:32:22,096
        Shiloh is naturally warm
             and inclusive,     

12822
26:32:22,097 --> 26:32:22,735
   and that can be misunderstood
          by some of our more...

12823
26:32:22,736 --> 26:32:23,374
          vulnerable volunteers.

12824
26:32:23,375 --> 26:32:24,013
So, what does Shiloh do         
      about that?               

12825
26:32:24,014 --> 26:32:24,652
               He handles it.

12828
26:32:25,931 --> 26:32:26,569
my friend's vulnerable          
   and -- and naive.            

12829
26:32:26,570 --> 26:32:27,208
I just -- I don't --            
I don't want her to get hurt,   

12830
26:32:27,209 --> 26:32:27,847
so, I mean, what d--            
how does he handle --

26:32:27,848 --> 26:32:28,486

12832
26:32:28,487 --> 26:32:29,125
           Yeah. Um...          

12833
26:32:29,126 --> 26:32:29,764

ONE OF HIS EMPLOYEES,           
A LAKOTA MAN,                   

15020
26:55:46,619 --> 26:55:47,257
HAD PUT IT IN HOCK

26:55:47,258 --> 26:55:47,896
IF HE WENT DOWN                 
AND TOOK IT OUT OF PAWN.        

15022
26:55:47,897 --> 26:55:48,535
SO HE BROUGHT IT DOWN

15030

15031
26:55:53,648 --> 26:55:54,286

15352
26:59:18,767 --> 26:59:19,405
   TODAY, LITERALLY MILLIONS

15353
26:59:19,406 --> 26:59:20,044
ARE HOUSED IN NON-NATIVE MUSEUMS
   AND PRIVATE COLLECTIONS.     

15354
26:59:20,045 --> 26:59:20,683
  MANY OF THESE OBJECTS, LIKE   
 TOOLS, WEAPONS, AND CLOTHES,   

15355
26:59:20,684 --> 26:59:21,322
     WERE ACQUIRED THROUGH      
    PERFECTLY LEGAL MEANS.

    FOR PENNIES OR STOLEN.      

15357
26:59:21,962 --> 26:59:22,600
    THE U.S. GOVERNMENT SAW     
   NOTHING WRONG WITH THIS,     

15358
26:59:22,601 --> 26:59:23,239
  SINCE ITS OFFICIAL POSITION   
         ON THE TRIBES          

15359
26:59:23,240 --> 26:59:23,878

15360

      BUT NATIVE PEOPLES        
      ARE STILL WITH US,        

15361
26:59:24,518 --> 26:59:25,156

15363
26:59:25,796 --> 26:59:26,434
SO IN 1990, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT

15366
26:59:27,713 --> 26:59:28,351
        NAGPRA REQUIRES

15367

15757
27:03:37,562 --> 27:03:38,200
SET OUT TO ATTACK A TANK FACTORY

15758

15759

         AND THE 445th          
        GETS SEPARATED          

15760
27:03:39,479 --> 27:03:40,117

15763

  IN LESS THAN FOUR MINUTES,    
 116 AMERICAN PILOTS ARE DEAD.

15765

 THEY WERE ALMOST HYSTERICAL.

15771

       THE WAR GOES ON.         

15772

27:06:52,748 --> 27:06:54,081
          HOW'D YOU GET THE GUN?

15858
27:06:54,150 --> 27:06:56,283
I HAD INHERITED IT FROM         
MY FATHER WHEN HE PASSED AWAY.  

15859
27:06:56,352 --> 27:06:58,085
     <i> MIKE SAYS HIS FATHER</i>

15863
27:07:07,663 --> 27:07:09,663
I THINK WHEN QUINN              
ACQUIRED IT,                    

15864
27:07:09,732 --> 27:07:12,333
IT HAD TO HAVE BEEN             
IN THE MID-'70s.

15866

TWO DAYS LATER, ONE OF          
HIS FRIENDS TALKED TO ME,       

15867
27:07:18,508 --> 27:07:22,409
AND HE WAS VERY UPSET           
ABOUT THE PLANE CRASH,          

15868
27:07:22,478 --> 27:07:26,914
BUT HE WAS ALSO VERY WORRIED    
THAT NOW I OWN THIS PIECE       

15869
27:07:26,983 --> 27:07:30,251
AND HE DIDN'T WANT ME           
TO BE SHOWING IT OFF            

15870
27:07:30,319 --> 27:07:34,989
OR TELLING ANYBODY ABOUT IT,    
AND I HAVEN'T.                  

15871
27:07:35,057 --> 27:07:39,193
THAT'S WHY I'VE HAD IT          
FOR 30 YEARS HIDDEN AWAY.       

15872
27:07:39,262 --> 27:07:41,528
  WHAT'D YOU THINK WHEN YOUR DAD
  TOLD YOU THAT THIS WAS USED   

15873
27:07:41,597 --> 27:07:43,330
      IN THE ST. VALENTINE'S DAY
      MASSACRE?                 

15874
27:07:43,399 --> 27:07:46,267
I THOUGHT, "COME ON,            
YOU'RE PULLING MY LEG."         

15875
27:07:46,335 --> 27:07:48,369
AND HE WAS DEAD SERIOUS.        

15876
27:07:48,437 --> 27:07:50,871
AND HE WAS A SERIOUS            
KIND OF GUY.                    

15877
27:07:50,940 --> 27:07:53,707
WHEN IT CAME TO WEAPONS         
LIKE THIS IN HIS COLLECTION,    

15878
27:07:53,776 --> 27:07:55,309
HE WAS NOT FOOLING.             

15879
27:07:55,378 --> 27:07:57,077
            MIKE, WHAT EXACTLY  
            DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?

15880
27:07:57,146 --> 27:08:00,514
IF IT TRULY IS THE SHOTGUN      
THAT WAS USED

15882
27:08:02,652 --> 27:08:03,984
           I WILL SEE WHAT I CAN
           FIND OUT.            

15883
27:08:04,053 --> 27:08:06,020
    DO YOU MIND IF I SIT HERE   
    FOR A WHILE AND EVALUATE IT?

15884
27:08:06,088 --> 27:08:07,988
ABSOLUTELY NOT.                 

15885
27:08:08,057 --> 27:08:10,190

   DEPARTMENT AT CHRISTIE'S,    

15886
27:08:10,259 --> 27:08:12,192

  <i> IN THE MURDER OF SEVEN MEN</i>

16184
27:20:42,076 --> 27:20:43,342
             SO IN YOUR OPINION,

16185
27:20:43,411 --> 27:20:44,844
   COULD THIS GUN HAVE BEEN USED
   IN THE MASSACRE?             

16186
27:20:44,913 --> 27:20:45,912
    YES.                        

16187
27:20:45,980 --> 27:20:47,380
IT IS THE RIGHT VINTAGE.        

16188
27:20:47,448 --> 27:20:49,582
IT HAS BOTH THE EXTRACTOR       
AND EJECTOR MARKINGS            

16189
27:20:49,651 --> 27:20:51,651
WHICH GODDARD IDENTIFIED.       

16190
27:20:51,719 --> 27:20:54,487
       WE CAN PROVE THAT THE GUN
       THAT WAS SHOT THAT DAY   

16191
27:20:54,555 --> 27:20:56,589
              WAS A 12-GAUGE    
              REPEATING SHOTGUN.

16192
27:20:56,658 --> 27:20:58,891
          YOUR GUN IS A 12-GAUGE
          REPEATING SHOTGUN.    

16193
27:20:58,960 --> 27:21:00,860
RIGHT, RIGHT.                   
THAT'S GREAT.

  <i> AND TIED TO THE KILLINGS.</i>    

16197
27:21:07,368 --> 27:21:10,469
WHILE WE CAN'T CONCLUSIVELY LINK
YOUR GUN TO THE MASSACRE,       

16198
27:21:10,538 --> 27:21:12,171
       NO EVIDENCE RULES IT OUT.

16199
27:21:12,240 --> 27:21:13,439
VERY INTERESTING.               

16200

16201
27:21:15,743 --> 27:21:17,910

16203
27:21:19,947 --> 27:21:21,380
         HOW DO YOU THINK       
         YOUR FATHER WOULD FEEL,

16204
27:21:21,449 --> 27:21:22,815

16205

16222
27:22:07,862 --> 27:22:10,296
  THE THOMPSON SUBMACHINE GUN

16223
27:22:10,364 --> 27:22:13,499
      BY RETIRED GENERAL

16224
27:22:13,568 --> 27:22:16,302
      EARLY MACHINE GUNS        
     WERE EXTREMELY HEAVY       

16225
27:22:16,370 --> 27:22:18,737
     AND TOOK SEVERAL MEN

16226
27:22:18,806 --> 27:22:22,108

27:22:24,679 --> 27:22:26,879

16229
27:22:26,948 --> 27:22:29,748
      TO SWEEP THE ENEMY

16230
27:22:29,817 --> 27:22:32,751

  UNTIL AFTER THE WAR ENDED,    

16231
27:22:32,820 --> 27:22:36,555
SO THE GENERAL TRIED SELLING IT

16237

      OF THE CHICAGO MOB        

16238
27:22:56,511 --> 27:22:59,678

  AS THE CHICAGO TYPEWRITER,

      THE CHICAGO PIANO,        

16240

16241

FOR CONCEALMENT, THE COMPACT GUN
     COULD BE TOTED AROUND

16403
27:30:25,826 --> 27:30:28,660
FROM SOMEONE CALLING HIMSELF    
JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH TO JACKSON, 

16404
27:30:28,729 --> 27:30:29,861
AND THIS IS IT.                 

16405
27:30:29,930 --> 27:30:31,096
                  AND THAT'S IT.

16406
27:30:31,164 --> 27:30:33,465
AND NOT ONLY NO LETTERS         
FROM BOOTH OR TO BOOTH,         

16407
27:30:33,533 --> 27:30:36,267
BUT NO MENTION OF BOOTH         
IN JACKSON'S CORRESPONDENCE.

16411
27:30:43,410 --> 27:30:44,976
EVERY JACKSON BIOGRAPHER,       

16412
27:30:45,045 --> 27:30:46,645
HAS ASSUMED THAT BOOTH          
DIDN'T WRITE IT.                

16413
27:30:46,713 --> 27:30:48,046
SOMEONE IN HIS OFFICE --        

16414
27:30:48,115 --> 27:30:49,714
AND HE HAD A NUMBER OF CLERKS   
WORKING FOR HIM --              

16415
27:30:49,783 --> 27:30:52,183
PROBABLY WROTE THIS WORD        
"ANONYMOUS."                    

16416
27:30:52,252 --> 27:30:53,451
       JACKSON DID NOT WRITE IT.

16417
27:30:53,520 --> 27:30:55,654
IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE         
JACKSON'S HANDWRITING, NO.      

16418
27:30:55,722 --> 27:30:57,622
      HAS THERE BEEN AN ANALYSIS

16419
27:30:57,691 --> 27:30:59,491
              OF THE HANDWRITING
              IN THIS LETTER?   

16420
27:30:59,559 --> 27:31:01,993
AS FAR AS I KNOW, NO ONE HAS    
EVER TAKEN IT TO THAT STEP      

16421
27:31:02,062 --> 27:31:04,229
BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT            
IT WAS UNNECESSARY.             

16422
27:31:04,297 --> 27:31:07,565
<i> THAT SEEMS A CURIOUS OMISSION.</i>

16428
27:31:22,382 --> 27:31:23,982
HEATHER, NICE TO MEET YOU.      

16429
27:31:24,051 --> 27:31:26,851
SO THIS IS THE ORIGINAL LETTER. 

16430
27:31:26,920 --> 27:31:30,655
I PICKED TWO OF OUR             
JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH LETTERS     

16431
27:31:30,724 --> 27:31:32,357
FOR A HANDWRITING ANALYSIS.     

16432
27:31:32,426 --> 27:31:33,992
I PICKED THESE TWO LETTERS      

16433
27:31:34,061 --> 27:31:36,861
BECAUSE THEY WERE CLOSEST       
IN DATE AND FORMAT              

16434
27:31:36,930 --> 27:31:39,764
TO THE 1835 LETTER              
TO GENERAL JACKSON.             

16435
27:31:39,833 --> 27:31:41,699
     <i> IT'S THE FIRST TIME</i>

     <i> THE ORIGINAL LETTER</i>

    <i> AND A COUPLE OF ITEMS</i>      
      <i> STRIKE HER AS ODD.</i>       

16438
27:31:45,939 --> 27:31:48,840
HE SIGNS THE LETTER TO JACKSON  
WITH HIS FULL NAME,             

16439
27:31:48,909 --> 27:31:50,575
JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH.            

16440
27:31:50,644 --> 27:31:53,812
ALL OF THE LETTERS AT THE FOLGER
ARE SIGNED J.B. BOOTH,          

16441
27:31:53,880 --> 27:31:56,247
AND THAT WAS HIS TYPICAL        
SIGNATURE.                      

16442
27:31:56,316 --> 27:31:58,083
    <i> THE REST OF THE LETTER</i>     
         <i> LOOKS AS IF</i>           

16443
27:31:58,151 --> 27:32:00,251
      <i> IT COULD'VE FLOWED</i>       
      <i> FROM THE SAME PEN.</i>       

16444
27:32:00,320 --> 27:32:03,922
AND YOU SEE HERE, "I WROTE      
TO YOU REPEATED CAUTIONS,"      

16445
27:32:03,990 --> 27:32:05,757
AND SEE THE BOTTOM OF THAT C,   

16446
27:32:05,826 --> 27:32:07,792
HOW IT LOOPS AROUND             
DRAMATICALLY?                   

16447
27:32:07,861 --> 27:32:10,395
WELL, IN THIS LETTER HERE,      
WE SEE THE WORD "CAMP"          

16448
27:32:10,464 --> 27:32:14,666
WITH THAT SAME VERY DISTINCTIVE 
MAJUSCULE C,                    

16449
27:32:14,734 --> 27:32:18,703
WHICH IS VERY UNIQUE            
TO JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH.         

16450
27:32:18,772 --> 27:32:21,406
ONE OF THE MOST DISTINCTIVE     
ATTRIBUTES HE HAS               

16451
27:32:21,475 --> 27:32:24,442
IS THE CROSSBAR                 
ON THE MINISCULE T's.           

16452
27:32:24,511 --> 27:32:27,745
SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE WORD "THE"
IN THIS LETTER,                 

16453
27:32:27,814 --> 27:32:31,316
THE CROSSBAR GOES FULLY ACROSS  
NOT JUST THE T                  

16454
27:32:31,384 --> 27:32:33,251
BUT ALSO THE H AND THE E.       

16455
27:32:33,320 --> 27:32:35,620
  <i> IF BOOTH DIDN'T WRITE THIS</i>   
           <i> HIMSELF,</i>            

16456
27:32:35,689 --> 27:32:40,725
   <i> SHE SAYS THE FORGER WAS</i>     
   <i> AT THE TOP OF HIS CLASS.</i>

27:32:40,794 --> 27:32:43,061
        <i> HEATHER'S MADE</i>         
      <i> ANOTHER DISCOVERY.</i>       

16458
27:32:43,129 --> 27:32:45,563
THIS LETTER FROM 1834           

16459
27:32:45,632 --> 27:32:49,267
MENTIONS THAT HE NEEDED         
TO ESCAPE THE FARM              

16460
27:32:49,336 --> 27:32:51,669
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS            
AND GO TO PHILADELPHIA,         

16461
27:32:51,738 --> 27:32:54,439
AND IT SAYS, "THEREFORE         
I STROLLED TO PHILADELPHIA.     

16462
27:32:54,507 --> 27:32:58,176
BROWER'S HOTEL IS NOW           
ABOUT THE BEST IN THAT CITY."   

16463
27:32:58,245 --> 27:33:00,211
             SO HE HAS A HISTORY
             OF FREQUENTING     

16464
27:33:00,280 --> 27:33:02,914
              THE BROWER'S HOTEL
              IN PHILADELPHIA.  

16465
27:33:02,983 --> 27:33:04,349
           SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

16466
27:33:04,417 --> 27:33:07,185
         DID JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH
         WRITE THIS LETTER?     

16467
27:33:07,254 --> 27:33:09,754
BASED ON HANDWRITING ANALYSIS   
ALONE,                          

16468
27:33:09,823 --> 27:33:12,957
YES, IT IS A JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH
LETTER.                         

16469
27:33:13,026 --> 27:33:14,592
BUT I'M NOT A BOOTH EXPERT,     

16470
27:33:14,661 --> 27:33:17,562
SO I THINK THAT'S A QUESTION    
FOR BOOTH SCHOLARS.             

16471
27:33:17,631 --> 27:33:20,365
WE'D NEED TO FIND OUT MORE      
ABOUT THE CONTEXT OF THE LETTER.

16482
27:33:47,160 --> 27:33:49,193
             THERE'S NO QUESTION
             HE WAS INSANE.

16486
27:33:59,606 --> 27:34:01,239
               HE WOULD RUN AWAY
               FROM THE THEATER 

16487
27:34:01,308 --> 27:34:04,709

               THEATER MANAGERS 
               WOULD LOCK HIM UP

16490
27:34:11,451 --> 27:34:14,285
             TO KEEP HIM        
             FROM GETTING DRUNK.

16491

LEAD HIM TO ACTS OF VIOLENCE?

              YES, BUT ONLY     
              VERY OCCASIONALLY.

16495
27:34:24,097 --> 27:34:27,665
     HE WAS CAPABLE IN

 IN KILLING DESDEMONA AS OTHELLO

16497
27:34:34,674 --> 27:34:36,307

WELL, THIS LETTER               
IS A THREAT                     

16501
27:34:45,719 --> 27:34:48,519

PRESIDENT ANDREW JACKSON.       

16502
27:34:48,588 --> 27:34:52,356
COULD THAT VIOLENT BEHAVIOR     
HAVE EXTENDED TO MURDER?        

16503
27:34:52,425 --> 27:34:54,459
                 IT IS POSSIBLE.

16504
27:34:54,527 --> 27:34:57,428
         HOWEVER, IT'S IMPORTANT

27:34:57,497 --> 27:35:00,798
        JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH

16506

         THAT WAS EXTRAORDINARY.

16508
27:35:07,006 --> 27:35:09,574
         HIS KIDS WERE FORBIDDEN

16509
27:35:09,642 --> 27:35:12,009
