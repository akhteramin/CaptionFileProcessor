CHARACTER RAIGS.                
THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED IF HE   

2718
01:04:38,590 --> 01:04:43,459
THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED IF HE   
THOUGHT HE WAS AN HONORABLE MAN

AND ALSO I THOUGHT IT WAS       

2725
01:04:52,771 --> 01:04:53,670

STRIKING THAT HE SAID THAT      

2726
01:04:53,672 --> 01:04:54,704

WHY IN HIS WORDS HE PUNTED.     

2731
01:05:02,714 --> 01:05:08,518
WHY IN HIS WORDS HE PUNTED.

IN THE PRESIDENT'S CRAW AND RUDY
GIULIANI IS IS THE LINE THAT    

2759

SAYS THAT WE CAN'T CONCLUDE THE
