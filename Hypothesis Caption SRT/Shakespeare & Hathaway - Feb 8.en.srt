00:00:16,751 --> 00:00:18,050
                    [door opens]

2
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:20,252
      See what dirt             
      you can find on her.      

3
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:23,021
              Joy.              

4
00:00:23,057 --> 00:00:25,391
       You have a visitor.      

5
00:00:25,426 --> 00:00:27,860
      A Mr. Martin Mariner.     

6
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:30,028
         Just your type.        

7
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:34,566
Are you Frank Hathaway?         

8
00:00:34,602 --> 00:00:36,702
       -Are you American?       
       -Yes, sir.               

9
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:38,404
From Nashville, Tennessee.      

10
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:41,273
So, are you Frank Hathaway?     

11
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:43,642
            Uh, yes.            

12
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:45,110
Oh. Oh, Frank!                  

13
00:00:45,146 --> 00:00:46,445
-[grunts]                       
-It's so great                  

14
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,247
to finally meet you.            

15
00:00:48,282 --> 00:00:50,115
Or should I call you            
Francis?                        

16
00:00:50,151 --> 00:00:52,651
Oh, let me take                 
a look at you.                  

17
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:55,454
            You have two seconds
            to let me go.       

18
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:59,725
Oh, no way. I've been dreaming  
about this moment for years.    

19
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,693
                   One... two...

20
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:04,163
          -Frank...             
          -Easy, tiger.         

21
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:06,298
        -I did warn him.        
        -Too much.              

22
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:09,168
                  Frank, please.
                  That hurts.   

23
00:01:09,203 --> 00:01:10,602
                          A lot.

24
00:01:10,638 --> 00:01:11,804
      Who the hell are you?     

25
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:13,405
                 I'm your uncle.

26
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,407
              What?             

27
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:18,343
            We're family, Frank.

28
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:20,746
Ain't it wonderful?             

29
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:45,337
 [Frank]                        
 What, you're my dad's brother? 

30
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:46,572
          [Martin]              
          That's right.         

31
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,507
               My mother is your
               grandmother.     

32
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:50,409
But don't you think my dad      
might have mentioned you?       

33
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,878
          He might not even know
          I exist.              

34
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:54,680
         I was adopted at birth.

35
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:57,015
     I was raised by a wonderful
     British couple             

36
00:01:57,051 --> 00:01:58,850
                   who moved out
                   to Tennessee.

37
00:01:58,886 --> 00:02:03,388
 But now they've both passed,   
 I'm tracing my blood relations.

38
00:02:03,424 --> 00:02:04,590
               And you, Frank...

39
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:05,691
                 [clicks tongue]

40
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:07,626
             ...you are my first
             discovery.         

41
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:09,027
Cobblers.                       

42
00:02:09,063 --> 00:02:10,896
            Well, I'll show you.

43
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:14,366
         Now, birth certificate.

44
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:15,467
           And that's my mother.

45
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:18,170
      [Lu]                      
      "Elizabeth Hathaway."     

46
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:19,705
       Is that your grandmother?

47
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,973
    Well, it's a common name.   

48
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:23,108
      [Lu]                      
      Maiden name: Foster.      

49
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,377
I haven't got a clue            
about maiden names.             

50
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:27,179
She died years                  
before I was born.              

51
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:28,880
      How come the father's     
      not listed?               

52
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:33,418
 Well, young man, it's very     
 possible that I'm a love child.

53
00:02:33,454 --> 00:02:34,786
Oh, great.                      

54
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:37,022
So now you're calling my nana   
a tramp as well as a liar.      

55
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:40,759
  Here's our family tree, Frank.

56
00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:44,029
    I only managed to go back   
    to the 17th century.        

57
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:46,264
           [Sebastian]          
           Incredible.          

58
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,700
So, 1953.                       

59
00:02:48,736 --> 00:02:50,369
Is that when                    
your nan died?                  

60
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:52,371
  Well, around that time, yes.  

61
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:55,674
        I can't find Elizabeth's
        death certificate       

62
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:57,943
                 to confirm     
                 the actual day.

63
00:02:57,978 --> 00:03:02,247
 But since I know that my mother
 died in childbirth,            

64
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:07,019
  got to be my birthday:        
  4th of July, Independence Day.

65
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:08,620
  That's great detective work,  
  Martin, yeah.                 

66
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,222
       -Thank you, ma'am.       
       -[Frank] Ah!             

67
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:13,191
     She died in childbirth,    
     did you say?               

68
00:03:13,227 --> 00:03:14,459
                   That's right.

69
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:16,862
Because my nana died            
in a car crash.                 

70
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:19,264
      Are you absolutely certain
      about that, Frank?        

71
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:22,501
   Because my adoptive parents  
   were told that my mother died

72
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:23,969
             giving birth to me.

73
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:26,405
   It's the only thing about    
   my nana that I am sure of.   

74
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,672
           Ow, Frank!           

75
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,341
    [Frank]                     
    Wrong Elizabeth Hathaway.   

76
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,510
 Oh, what a shame. There we are.
 Let me help you with these.    

77
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:34,279
            -Frank...           
            -Come on.           

78
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:36,081
  [Martin] We're related, Frank.
  I can feel it.                

79
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:37,382
         [Frank]                
         Apparently not.        

80
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:38,884
     At least let me buy you    
     a coffee.                  

81
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,519
Come on.                        

82
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:43,889
[in mock American accent]       
Thanks for stopping by!         

83
00:03:51,532 --> 00:03:52,898
              What?             

84
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,268
        He was obviously        
        a con man.              

85
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:59,070
          What's he after, then?
          Your fortune?         

86
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,207
             [sighs]            

87
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:08,079
          So, when did this Lola
          start work here?      

88
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:09,381
[Leon]                          
Three months ago.               

89
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,049
I gave her the job.             

90
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,451
I honestly thought              
I could trust her.              

91
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:13,985
That's what hurts               
the most.                       

92
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:16,388
  -Aye. When was this accident? 
  -[Leon] A month ago.          

93
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,423
  I found Lola out in the back, 
  screaming.                    

94
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:20,425
      She claimed a box         
      of Shakespeare busts      

95
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:22,194
    had fallen off a trolley    
    and landed on her foot.     

96
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:24,463
   -[chuckles]                  
   -[Diana] Next thing we know  

97
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:26,665
she's on crutches and suing us  
for compensation.               

98
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,966
          No witnesses,         
          I take it?            

99
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,134
[Leon]                          
Of course not.                  

100
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:31,102
    [Lu]                        
    Twisted ankle ligaments.    

101
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:33,638
    The only thing twisted      
    is that girl's morality.    

102
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:35,607
   So you want us to prove      
   she was faking the injury?   

103
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:39,044
Photos, videos.                 
You do whatever it takes.       

104
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,245
    Surveillance isn't cheap.   

105
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,613
           And neither are      
           compensation payouts.

106
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:43,849
       -Fair enough.            
       -The awful thing is      

107
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:45,250
the hearing's been              
brought forward.                

108
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,518
It's now next week.             

109
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:48,386
             We will get on this
             right away.        

110
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:49,754
                    Don't worry.

111
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:54,426
 [Frank]                        
 I think you put a few too many 
 noughts on there by mistake.   

112
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,027
            [laughs]            

113
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:57,963
Frank.                          

114
00:04:57,998 --> 00:04:59,764

00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:44,769
             Frank.             

230
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:47,038
          Didn't take you       
          as the gift shop type.

231
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:49,974
       Yeah, I ran out          
       of Waterlily soap.       

232
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:51,842
[chuckles and clears throat]    

233
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:54,378
Fraud claim involving           
an ex-member of staff.          

234
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:56,447
I came to see my client.        

235
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:59,216
      Going to have to talk     
      to the husband now.       

236
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:01,052
     And you can scratch her    
     off the list,              

237
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,621
             the girl we've been
             trailing.          

238
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:04,755
             Thanks.            

239
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,357
And given it's a robbery        
gone wrong...                   

240
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,591
                          Is it?

241
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:09,226
Back door forced.               

242
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:10,461
Signs of a struggle.            

243
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:13,597
      Blow to the head          
      with Arden's finest.      

244
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:15,967
    Till open and money gone.   

245
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:18,035
What does that look like        
to you?                         

246
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:20,671
              Yeah.             

247
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:22,840
        You see those           
        pieces of glass?        

248
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,608
             Mm-hm.             

249
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:26,744
     [Frank]                    
     How did they get there?    

250
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:29,046
            Embedded themselves 
            during the struggle.

251
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,182
 Yeah, but they're not embedded,
 are they?                      

252
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:33,284
They've just been placed there. 

253
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,052
When that glass fell            
on the victim,                  

254
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,521
she was lying still,            
almost certainly dead.          

255
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:42,059
 Now, why would the killer add  
 smashed glass after the murder?

256
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:44,428
             Answer:            

257
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:46,230
      to make it look like      
      a robbery.                

258
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,567
     You might want to talk     
     to someone called P.       

259
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,901
               P?               

260
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,771
Yeah, it's the person she texted
at 7 minutes past 3:00          

261
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:55,339
yesterday afternoon.            

262
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,274
        You tampered            
        with the victim's phone?

263
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:00,111
    I took a brief look,        
    and I'm wearing a glove.    

264
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:02,079
          [phone beeps]         

265
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,381
        [Marlowe]               
        "We need to talk.       

266
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,683

        after closing.

          Kiss, kiss."          

269
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,054
  The "cat" being the husband,  
  Leon.                         

270
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:12,757
   He's not back yet.           
   I'll call him if you like.   

271
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,492
     -Save you the trouble.     
     -Thanks.                   

272
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:17,061
   I've got it from here, Frank.

273
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:18,729
                 Well, just keep
                 an open mind.  

274
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:20,064
       Don't patronize me.      

275
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:21,732
           -I wasn't.           
           -Good.               

276
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:24,568
     You can get on with        
     your fraud claim, then.    

277
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:27,972
     Okay. Over here, guys.     

278
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:32,910
        It's like Luke Skywalker
        telling Yoda to sod off.

279
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:35,246
          Yoda? Really?         

280
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:38,582
   [knock on door, door opens]  

281
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:40,618
  So it looks like the profits  
  from the business             

282
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,819
all went to Diana,              

283
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:43,254
and Leon just got               
a monthly wage.                 

284
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:44,588
Not much of one, either.        

285
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:46,657
   [Frank] So she's skinning him
   for his cash                 

286
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,692
    and cuckolding him          
    with this "P" character.    

287
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:50,895
      Leon Tarsich must be      
      in the frame, right?      

288
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,564
   [Sebastian]                  
   Come through, Mr. Tarsich.   

289
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:02,306
We're very sorry

291
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:07,344
      I don't think I'll need...

292
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,547
   the Lola thing doesn't seem  
   like such a...               

293
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:14,518
     We understand entirely.    

294
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:16,020
        Don't we, Frank?        

295
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:18,122
                Of course. Yeah.

296
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:21,058
         -Thank you.            
         -[Frank] The...        

297
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:23,294
   the local police are really  
   stretched at the moment,     

298
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:26,197
   so they've asked us to help  
   track down Diana's killer.   

299
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:32,002
            I'm really sorry    
            to have to ask this,

300
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,872
              but where were you
              yesterday?        

301
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:37,575
I was in Manchester.            

302
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,476
At a gift shop                  
conference.                     

303
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:42,179
Came back this morning          
as soon as I heard the...       

304
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,549
  And everything was all right  
  at home, was it?              

305
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:47,418
       Yeah, it was good.

00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:50,487
     [Lu]                       
     Yeah? Diana was happy?     

307
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:51,689
           Perfectly.           

308
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,424
                 No suggestion  
                 of another man?

309
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:54,792
No.                             

310
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:57,561
Was there anything else?        

311
00:14:57,597 --> 00:15:00,030
                  No. Thank you.

                      Thank you.

313
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:07,538
   We'll do everything we can   
   to help.                     

314
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,412
Sebastian, find out if there was
a gift shop conference          

315

        in Manchester yesterday.

316
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,883
Fine. By the way,               
did you notice his nails?

Now you're a businessman

320
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,792
        -I respect that.        
        -Yeah, goodbye.

your grandma died,

       -[Sebastian] Mm-mm.      

328
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:47,778
  What? There's nothing anywhere
  about my nana's death online? 

329
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:48,879
Nope.                           

330
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:50,314
        -Was she buried?        
        -Yes.                   

331
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,182
     Well, then the date will be
     on the gravestone.         

332
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:53,851
       I'll have to find        
       the cemetery first.      

333
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,819
 Yeah, but you're               
 Mr. Family History, aren't you?

334
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:58,956
 All I know is it's in a village
 somewhere in the Cotswolds.    

335
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:00,557
                  The Cotswolds?

336
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:02,760
Yeah, my granddad travelled     
south with work.                

337
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:06,363
   I mean, I went there once,   
   but I was about 11.

00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:11,368
Gonna have to resort to using   
a Ouija board at this rate.     

340
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,706
I need another drink.           

341
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,546
                    What's that?

342
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,915
        [Frank]                 
        Looks like blood.       

343
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:27,184
             Hey...             

344
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:29,553
If we could get Forrest Gump Sr.
done for something,             

345
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:31,021
we could be off the hook.       

346
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:34,224
I'm going to send one of these  
to my mate Freddie at Forensics.

347
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,793
Ooh.                            

348
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,227
           What is it?          

349
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:40,431
Email from the Golden Horizons  
Gift Shop Conference            

350
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,099
in Manchester.                  

351
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:46,203
  Apparently, Leon Tarsich      
  registered yesterday morning, 

352
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:47,971
         and guess what?        

353
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:51,241
     Afternoon and evening,     
     never showed up.           

354
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:57,114
       Well, I was there.       

355
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:00,651
Did you talk to anyone?         

356
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,152
        Well, not really.       

357
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,521
 Look, I've already been through
 all this with the police.      

358
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:07,191
    Now, we appreciate that,    
    Mr., uh, Tarshah...         

359
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:08,392
            -Sich.              
            -...ich.            

360
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:10,794
[Lu] I notice from              
your bank statements            

361
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,596
that you've been making         
regular payments                

362
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:15,232
to "Bar MM" on the second Friday
of every month.                 

363
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:17,201
     The police let you see     
     my bank statements?        

364
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:19,369
     You wouldn't believe       
     how much they trust us.    

365
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,805
Well, that's the Mucky Mallard. 

366
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:23,507
     I go there                 
     with a couple of mates.    

367
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,409
   Hey, I go there every Friday.

368
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:28,946
        Yeah, I thought         
        I recognized you.       

369
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:31,782
Can I use your                  
bathroom?                       

370
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:35,219
  Yeah, it's just on the right  
  past the bedroom.             

371
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,392
So, then, Diana's money?        

372
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,895
Must be quite a whack of it.    
Does that come to you, is it?   

373
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,864
               I haven't even   
               thought about it.

374
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,366
Of course, sorry,               
I didn't mean to...             

375
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,274
    He's never been in the Mucky
    Mallard on a Friday night,  

376
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:58,609
    I can tell you that much.   

377
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:00,377
 [Lu]                           
 And they had separate bedrooms.

378
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,712
    [Frank]                     
    So, problems in the sack,   

379
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:02,980
       wife playing away,       

380
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:06,617
a clear financial motive,       
and an alibi that stinks.       

381
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,689
                        [laughs]

382
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:15,025
    Yeah, I'm with them now,    
    Mr. Tarsich.                

383
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,461
       I'll call you back.      

384
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:19,696
   Misrepresentation            
   is a criminal offense, Frank.

385
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:21,064
So's murder.                    

386
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,533
 -Stop harassing him.           
 -Only if you promise to start. 

387
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,602
    I don't know why            
    you're wasting your time.   

388
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:27,137
         He couldn't have killed
         his wife anyway.       

389
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:29,439
  -Why not?                     
  -He was on the phone to you.  

390
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:33,677
         Based on smashed clocks
         at the scene,          

391
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:35,746
           an aborted 999 call  
           on the victim's phone

392
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,481
       and the pathology report,

393
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:39,316
           we're sure that      
           the attack took place

394
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:41,618
at exactly 11 minutes           
past 7:00.                      

395
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,523
         -[Frank] Well?         
         -[Lu] Yeah.            

396
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:49,426
Leon was in the middle of one of
his five-minute rants with me.  

397
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:52,529
    Making a business call while
    committing a violent murder.

398
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,197
             That's some serious
             multitasking.      

399
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:58,435
              I got a phone call
              from Forensics.   

400
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,303
    You know the blood you found
    on those bank notes?        

401
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,739
      -Yeah?                    
      -It belongs to Diana.     

402
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:04,307
      -What?                    
      -So the question is,      

403
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:06,076
               where did you get
               the cash from?   

404
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:12,315
        [cell door opens]       

405
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:15,819
[Marlowe]                       
Mr. Mariner.                    

406
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:18,955
                          Frank!

407
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,957
Are you two                     
really related?                 

408
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,392
              -Yes.             
              -No.              

409
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:24,428
    -You've got five minutes.   
    -Thank you.                 

410
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,333
Frank, you got to help me.      

411
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,369
They're saying                  
I murdered some woman.          

412
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:34,137
  [sighs]                       
  I take it you didn't kill her?

413
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,672
No!                             

414
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:37,074
      Where'd you get the money?

415
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,275
[sighs]                         

416
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,376
From a guy.                     

417
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:41,778
I met him outside               
a pawnbroker's.                 

418
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:43,547
       What pawnbroker's?       

419
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:48,018
It was called Cash Changers,    
something like that.            

420
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:49,719
     What? Quid Converters?     

421
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:50,987
That's it.                      

422
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,489
   What were you doing there?   

423
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:56,960
I was selling                   
my parents' jewellery.          

424
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:58,228
                            Why?

425
00:19:58,263 --> 00:19:59,596
So I could hire you.            

426
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:01,998
This guy said                   
that he would pay double        

427
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,267
whatever I was offered inside.  

428
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:05,368
And he did.                     

429
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:07,170
      And that's the money      
      you gave us?              

430
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,672
              Mmm.              

431
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,141
          Right. Listen, Martin.

432
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:13,944
     I need you                 
     to describe this man to me.

433
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:18,515
        A lizard tattoo         
        on the side of his neck.

434
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,383
                   It's a start.

435
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:23,119
You seem pretty keen            
to get Martin off the charge.   

436
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:25,856
      Well, I just--            
      I don't think he's guilty.

437
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,858
Is that it?                     

438
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:28,992
                 Yes, that's it.

439
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:31,261
             It's got nothing   
             to do with the fact

440
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:32,696
        he's my long-lost uncle.

441
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:33,797
[laughs]                        

442
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:35,198
Methinks he doth protest        
too much.                       

443
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,666
    [Sebastian clears throat]   

444
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:38,401
    Mr. Tarsich.                
    He's brought your money.    

445
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,804
        You can count it.       

446
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:42,772
                Ah, don't worry.

447
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:44,875
My solicitor called.            

448
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,477
Lola's dropping                 
the compensation claim.         

449
00:20:47,513 --> 00:20:48,745
On compassionate grounds.       

450
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,113
     -That must be a relief.    
     -Yeah.                     

451
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:52,983
Oh, and I'm sorry for           
dropping you in it earlier.     

452
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:54,451
           Ah, no hard feelings.

453
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:56,620
You want to help,               
and I appreciate that.          

454
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,188
Are you getting                 
anywhere?                       

455
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:00,724
  You don't know of any         
  of your customers or suppliers

456
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,560
  who might have, like, a lizard
  tattoo on the neck, do you?

Lizard?                         

458
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:08,131
No, I don't.                    

459
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,667
Sorry.                          

460
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:11,868
Phil has got a tattoo.          

461
00:21:11,904 --> 00:21:13,203
I'm not sure                    
what it's of, though.           

462
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:14,638
              Phil?             

463
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:16,907
Yeah, Phil Layman.              
Lola's boyfriend.               

464
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,408
                         Thanks.

465
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:34,457
      I'm on my tea break, mate.

466
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:35,725
Turning down work, Phil?        

467
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:38,395
You must be doing               
all right.                      

468
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:41,231
Hey, nice tattoo.               

469
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:43,700
                        Unusual.

470
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:45,435
        You what? Do I know you?

471
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,703
[Frank]                         
No, but you know my uncle.      

472
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,071
        -[Phil] Oh, yeah?       
        -[Frank] Yeah.          

473
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:50,173
You bought some jewellery       
off him outside Quid Converters.

Big American fella.

475
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:55,445
No, don't know nothing about it.

476
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,280
It's all right, Phil.           
Don't worry about it.           

477
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,015
I'm here to buy it back.        

478
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:01,017
Family heirloom,                
you see.                        

479
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:02,652
Yeah, my uncle,

       short of a stand,        

481
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,388
    if you know what I mean.    

482
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:06,890
         [Frank laughs]         

483
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:08,792
Come on, how much               
do you want for it?             

484
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:13,029
  Hey, as I said,               
  I don't know nothing about it.

00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:15,398
[Frank]                         
I hear Lola's dropped the claim.

        -Do you work out?       
        -You...

       -Who are you?            
       -[Frank] Who am I?       

488
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:20,470
  That's a fundamental question.
  Who is anyone?                

489
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,738
                    Who are you?

      Tell me who sent you,     

492
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,009
  or I'll break your arm in two.

493
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:27,310
   [Frank]

         Oh, you brute.

00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:34,684
          I'm a copper.         

498
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,919
              Of course you are.

499
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:37,120
             Try me.

501
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,926
          Cheers, Phil.         

502
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,031
Don't point at me.

506
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:03,446
So, now you know                
how Martin felt.                

507
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:05,014
        Thanks for the sympathy.

508
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,449
                        [groans]
                        Well?   

509
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:10,420
Found this in the glove         
compartment.                    

510
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:12,622
             Ah. Classic burner.

511
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,263
            We've found our "P."

512
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:21,598
Yeah.                           

513
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:23,700
     [Marlowe] We located       
     a couple of bank notes     

514
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,902
       with blood on them       
       in his flat,             

515
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:27,737
      and we also found him     
      on CCTV                   

516
00:23:27,772 --> 00:23:30,106
in the vicinity of the gift shop
at the time of the murder.      

517
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:32,675
      And he's got previous     
      for robbery.              

518
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:33,943
How do you know that?           

519
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:35,812
     Because some people in here
     still rate me.             

520
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:39,048
Never knew you were             
so sensitive.                   

521
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:43,119
 So Diana gets Phil over to tell
 him she's ending the affair.   

522
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:45,755
 He takes it badly, whacks her  
 on the head with a big fossil. 

523
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,590
And then he staged              
a robbery.                      

524
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:51,194
Go on then, say it.             

525
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,298
        I'm not sure it was Phil
        who killed her.         

526
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,433
              What?             

527
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:58,935
                 Well, according
                 to the phone,  

528
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:02,305
       Diana wasn't his only bit
       on the side.             

529
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,207
Okay. So?                       

530
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:08,244
      So why would her ending it
      make him so angry?        

531
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,547
         Frank, I'm out.

He's a big fan of yours.        

534
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:17,053
He can't wait to get back       
to your search.                 

535
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:19,856
       Well, every silver lining
       has a cloud.             

536
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:21,157
[laughs]

539
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:30,233
     [Gloria] It was when Lu    
     gave me that look.         

540
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:31,701
[laughs]                        

541
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:33,303
           That was the moment  
           I realized I'd walked

542
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:35,104
           into a secret        
           undercover operation,

543
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,906
             and I nearly       
             had a heart attack.

544
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:40,076
Well, Lu says you covered it    
like Dame Judi herself.

00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:42,979
             I wasn't that good.

        No. The husband.        

549
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:51,654
         I didn't know          
         his real name.

did he use with you?

where Leon Tarsich

00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:25,021
really spent                    
those Friday nights.

                        Hang on.

She burned you?                 

607
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:18,127
    So, Diana was physically    
    abusing Leon                

608
00:28:18,162 --> 00:28:20,896
    because he wasn't the man   
    she thought she married.    

609
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:23,065
And he knew                     
about her affair.               

610
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:25,368
      I'd have been out of there
      like a shot.              

611
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:26,669
He had no money, though.        

612
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:28,971
      Yeah, he's got plenty now,

616
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,579
Except we know he didn't do it, 
because when Diana was killed,  

617
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:38,581
he was on the phone to me.

       I don't know,            
       but we've got to find it.

     did he?

at the parish burial records?

 Ah, well, the register         
 actually is held at Hardleton.
