120
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:45,710
            you still           
       lived in the flat.       

121
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:47,946
     Redhead? I've no idea.     
           [chuckles]           

122
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:49,347
         Well, you will         
          in a minute--         

123
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:51,182
          he's in here.         

124
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:53,351
        [exhaling deeply]       

125
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,989
           Or he was.           

126
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:00,425
          They must've          
      taken him somewhere.      

127
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,061
        Without his gown?       

128
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:05,130
      I'll get a locksmith      
       on that front door.      

129
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:07,332
    You can't have riff-raff    
  staggering in off the street. 

130
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,767
           No, the man          
        knew you, Edward.       

131
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:09,934
        I don't think so.       

132
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,102
      You can't just leave.     

133
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:13,471
        Why not? He did.        

134
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:19,711
        What's he hiding?       

135
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:22,414
     My question precisely.     

136
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:25,450
        [yawning deeply]        

137
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:26,885
      [bangs toolkit down]      

138
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,353
          Rough night?          

139
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,422
       We had this fellow       
         Ginsberg over.         

140
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:31,589
          He read from          
      this long poem of his     

141
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,024
      while the rest of us      
       played strip poker       

142
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,626
         till the heater        
          caught fire.          

143
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:35,960
      What a hoot! [laughs]     

144
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:38,296
        Hailey. You're in       
    a flea-infested rat-trap.   

145
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:39,831
      Sarge, it's my home.      

146
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,499
   And living with those men--  

147
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:43,134
       well, it's lowered       
         your standards         

148
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,569
    and raised some eyebrows.   

149
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:46,004
             You can            
           do better.           

150
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:48,373
 Yeah, and you were never young.

151
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,574
           All right.           
         So how's about         

152
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:51,009
         I fix whatever         
     you called me here for?    

153
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:52,310
           Closet door          
       giving you trouble?      

154
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:53,945
    I told Marcus he screwed    
        the hinges hinky,       

155
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,013
      but would he listen?      

156
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:57,482
        The closet door's       
          fine, Hailey.         

157
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:58,983
            Toaster!            

158
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:02,020
     That damn thing burned     
     my biscuits last week.     

159
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:04,322
  Good thing that guy of yours  
       is off to Vietnam.       

160
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,124
   I can finally fix things up  
          around here.          

161
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,593
            It's not            
          the toaster.          

162
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,099
            I'll say.           

163
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:16,000
          That your old         
       cryptogram machine?      

164
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:17,869
         It still work?         

165
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,737
          I was hoping          
       you could tell me.       

166
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:20,805
            I thought           
         the government         

167
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,307
        wouldn't let you        
      do anything with it.      

168
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:25,210
         They might now.        
      I did get the patent.     

169
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:26,911
          What are you          
            thinking?           

170
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,713
           Market it.           

171
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,949
      There's a demand for      
   simple encryption devices--  

172
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:33,685
     embassies, businesses,     
        newspaper cables.       

173
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,353
   Folks all looking for a way  

174
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:37,822
    to whisper their secrets    
         in plain sight.        

175
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:40,758
         I was thinking         
     we'd do a partnership.     

176
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:43,261
       Sarge, she's yours.      

177
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,830
  And she'll need a lot of work 
    to be a viable prototype.   

178
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:47,966
       But... if it sells?      

179
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:48,967
         [sighs deeply]         

180
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:50,134
       Could mean income.       

181
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,470
         For both of us.        

182
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:57,809
            [Hailey]:           
     Maybe I can do better.     

183
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:02,380
           Thank you.           

184
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,549
      His personal effects.     

185
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,818
      the nurse didn't know     
      what to do with them.     

186
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:09,387
   Cigarettes, wallet, socks.   

187
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,322
             He left            
       without his socks?       

188
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:12,991
          What on Earth         
      was he running from?      

189
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:14,692
       What I want to know      
    is what we do with them.    

190
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:16,194
       Well, sure as eggs,      

191
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:17,862
   my cousin knows how to get   
  this man's stuff back to him. 

192
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:19,297
      Maybe what's in there     

193
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,667
     can tell us why he came    
  and bloodied up our doorstep. 

194
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:28,006
        You sure you know       

195
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,741
       how to put this all      
      back together again?      

196
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:31,142
              Yup.              

197
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,277
              Good.             

198
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,582
         Sure are using         
       a lot of oil there.      

199
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:38,950
          That's 'cause         
      the parts are dirty.      

200
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:41,619
      Well, then shouldn't      
          you use soap?         

201
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:43,988
      I'll just charge you      
        parts and labour.       

202
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,323
           No. No, no,          
          you're right.         

203
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,058
       Just do your thing.      

204
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:48,626
         It's just that,        
       next to my babies,       

205
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:50,028
     this is the best thing     
        I ever dreamt up.       

206
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:51,562
          Yeah, and if          
      we're gonna succeed,      

207
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:54,465
the machine needs to be as solid
     as the ideas behind it.    

208
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:56,000
             [snap]             

209
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,740
             I think            
    it's kinda like sausage.    

210
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:04,175
            Sausage?            

211
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,576
           Yeah, like           
      we made on the farm.      

212
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:08,546
     We knew, if folks were     
 gonna enjoy the end-product... 

213
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:11,849
        Oh. They couldn't       
      see it getting made.      

214
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,284
             Bingo.             

215
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,954
So, how's about I take this baby
   of yours back to my place?   

216
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:20,591
              Sure.             

217
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:26,931
 [Jean]: I'll put the kettle on 
     and we can get started.    

218
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,967
          There must be         
        something in here       

219
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:31,502
          that's a way          
        to identify him.        

220
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:32,770
             Millie.            

221
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:34,172
-I say we start with the wallet.
         -Millie, look.         

222
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:38,309
      [Millie]: Oh, my God.     

223
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,211
        Whoever our man's       
         running from...        

224
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,513
       ...Is now after us.      

225
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,785
      [phone line ringing]      

226
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:51,622
            [sighing]           

227
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:52,790
          [Jean]: Sorry         
      to come by like this,     

228
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:54,792
       but we didn't know       
        who else to call.       

229
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:56,961
     [Iris]: No, of course.     
 You were smart to get out fast.

230
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:58,663
            [Hailey]:           
    They could've come back.    

231
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:00,064
    Heck, they still could've   
           been there.          

232
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,532
 [Jean]: From what I could see, 
       nothing was stolen,      

233
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:03,968
         which makes it         
       even more chilling.      

234
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,538
  Edward still isn't answering. 

235
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:09,741
       [Jean]: Well, what,      
     do we call the police?     

236
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,009
      That's the one thing      
the redhead begged us not to do.

237
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:13,444
           Either he's          
       into something bad,      

238
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,545
        or the cops are.        

239
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:16,080
          In this town,         
         it's a toss-up.        

240
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,949
     This is what the nurses    
            gave us,            

241
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,684
       everything we know       
           of the man.          

242
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:22,553
          See if we can         
      make sense of it all.     

243
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:27,391
        There was nothing       
         in his wallet--        

244
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:30,027
        just a couple of        
      dollars, and this...      

245
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:41,038
          Holy doodle.          

246
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:44,208
           Looks like           
     a marijuana cigarette.     

247
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:47,145
        Not that I'd know       
       anything about it.       

248
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,579
          I don't want          
          that in here.         

249
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:49,647
         Got it, Sarge.         

250
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:51,182
      Consider it unloaded.     

251
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:53,618
              Yes.              
        Into the garbage.       

252
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,355
          [muttering]:          
         Seems a waste.         

253
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:00,791
             [Jean]:            
   So he knew he was in danger  

254
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,460
           and decided          
     to make himself scarce.    

255
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,961
            [Millie]:           
      Whoever smashed us up     

256
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,162
        must've followed        

257
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:07,298
   this red-headed mystery man  
          to our flat.          

258
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,833
     [Iris]: And then waited    
      for you to clear out      

259
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:10,234
    and ransacked the place.    

260
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:14,839
              [♪♪♪]             

261
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,312
     [Jean]: He didn't want     
   anyone knowing who he was,   

262
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,847
      even if he got hurt.      

263
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,382
             [Iris]:            
   Especially if he got hurt.   

264
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,350
          Maybe because         
       that was no reefer.      

265
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,186
        [Millie gasping]        

266
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:31,222
             Oh, my!            

267
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:33,190
            It's like           
     miniature ticker-tape.     

268
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:35,593
    [Hailey]: Except just try   
       making sense of it.      

269
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:38,863
     It's some kind of code.    

270
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,531
            [Millie]:           
          And no drugs?         

271
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:42,733
     None that you'd smoke.     

272
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:46,804
         That's heroin.         

273
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:53,644
             [gasps]            
        I'd say that's...       

274
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,212
            more than           
        a hundred grams.        

275
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:56,380
            [Hailey]:           
            Hot damn.           

276
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,548
       What's that worth?       

277
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,583
         My guess is...         

278
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:01,953
    [sighs] ...maybe $4,000?    

279
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:04,789
           That's more          
     than I make in a year!     

280
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:08,826
      I've seen this stuff      
      hollow out a person,      

281
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:10,628
       whole communities.       

282
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,063
        I hate this stuff       
         with a passion.        

283
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,431
    I can flush it right now.   

284
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:17,902
          No, we won't.         

285
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:18,936
            We won't?           

286
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:20,471
              Oh...             
        Because we can't.       

287
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:23,741
       Someone is willing       
  to beat a man almost to death 

288
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:24,775
    in order to get it back.    

289
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:25,776
      If we get rid of it,      

290
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:26,911
           we could be          
        sealing his fate.       

291
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:28,379
        And ours as well.       

292
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,647
        So what do we do?       

293
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:31,949
        Well... work out        
       a way to return it.      

294
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:34,285
     Otherwise we're signing    
    the man's death warrant.    

295
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,287
         How do we know         
    he wasn't just a dealer,    

296
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:37,321
       and got in trouble?      

297
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:39,523
   Mommy, what are you doing?   

298
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,592
     Cadence. To your room.     

299
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:42,760
              Now.              

300
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:43,894
        I'll be in after        
       these ladies leave.

00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:48,632
         [troubled sigh]        

303
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:52,937
      [Jean]: Did you know,     
   when one has illicit drugs   

304
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,405
         burning a hole         
        in one's handbag,       

305
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,841
    it looks like everyone's    
    giving you the fish-eye?    

306
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,943
           The bottom           
     of your handbag, Jean,     

307
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:02,012
           is possibly          
   the safest place on Earth.

00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:03,280
       [knocking on door]       

309
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,384
     [Jean]: Well, let's not    
        test that theory        

310
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:07,518
   against a police detective.  

311

00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:13,791
        [Bryce]: Ladies!        

313
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:14,959
         There you are!         

314
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,662
         Just who I was         
          looking for.          

315
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:24,201
          I'm guessing          
  you've something to tell me.  

316
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:25,469
      You've been shopping?

        Oh! [laughs] Yes.

         Yes, we've been        
       buying up the town.

 I'll leave you two to chinwag.

         as a yes, then.

333
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,041
        but I fear you'd        
       get the wrong idea.      

334
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:05,342
     I've got a better one.

     How about I pick you up    
       when I finish work?      

336
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:09,880
        Very well, then.        

337
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,383
          But we've got         
          one problem.          

338
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,485
           A problem?           

339
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,222
       I noticed the lock       
     on that door is broken.    

340
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:21,392
          Oh, yes. Oh.          
      No, we're well aware.     

341
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,627
          My cousin is,         
     in fact, the landlord,     

342
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:25,496
         and he's going         
           to fix it.           

343
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,964
            Well, it            
         better be soon.        

344
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,165
     Because you never know

00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:29,733
       who might just walk      
       right on in there.       

346
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:31,068
           In fact...           

347

        but when the man        
        we were expecting       

580
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:40,090
         failed to show,        
             I left.            

581
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:41,891
        And... he stayed?       

582
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:43,226
      I guess, for a while.

584
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:47,730
       No! It had nothing       
        to do with that.        

585
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:49,032
           I told you           
      what I know, Camilla.     

586
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:50,600

      into something else.

       with drugs on him.

  Are you seriously telling me  
   that that's a coincidence?

   the night you were beaten,   

626
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:42,145
      and a meeting you had     

627

        with your friend,       
        Edward Harcourt.        

628

     I wouldn't call Edward     
           a "friend."          

629
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,783
     I barely know the guy.     

630
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,217
          Then why come         
     banging down his door?     

631
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:49,285
        I'd been mugged.        

632
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,287
       He was the closest       
        I could think of.       

633
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,689
         Yet no calling         
           the police.          

634
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:53,956
        What's the point?       

635
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,391
         Precisely what         
   we're trying to figure out.  

636
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:56,826
          Well, don't.

     I don't need your help!    
  Just walk out and forget me!  

638
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,730
         There are some         
   dangerous people after you,  

639
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:02,165

        after us as well.

 but this is crossing the line. 

641
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:07,403
             Do you             
        recognize these?        

642
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:09,505
           Haymakers.

   They were on you the night   
       you were attacked.       

645
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,410
      I met up with a man.      

646
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:16,079
        Friendly enough.        
       Offered 'em to me.       

647
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:18,981
         Started asking         
  about drop-offs and payments, 

648
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,983
           I told him           
  I had no clue what he meant,  

649
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,852
        so I walked away.       

650
00:25:22,887 --> 00:25:25,988
   Only he started following,   
 asking if I was the right guy. 

651
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:27,590
           I told him           
      it didn't seem I was,     

652
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:30,026

             and...             

655
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,867
    It took everything I had    
          to get away.          

656
00:25:38,903 --> 00:25:40,203

        what was in them?       

657
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:41,504
              What?

      is after these drugs,     

664
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:52,749
     and they'll do anything    
        to get them back.       

665
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:54,050
          Now, who did          
         you meet with?

668
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:58,821
        Then how did you        
      arrange the meeting?      

669
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:00,623

          someone else.

00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:48,538
         "Don't go near         
          the papers."          

694
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:49,972
       Ticker-tape paper?       

695
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:51,707
        Cigarette papers?       

696
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:52,708
       [Millie]: No idea.       

697
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:53,910
         For this code,         

698
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,711
          I'm inclined          
     to use<i> lex parsimoniae.</i>    

699
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,014
            Lex what?           

700
00:26:58,049 --> 00:26:59,015
       "Law of Parsimony."      

701
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,449
            According           
      to William of Ockham,     

702
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:02,919
    the hypothesis requiring    
     the fewest assumptions     

703
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,120
       should be selected.      

704
00:27:05,723 --> 00:27:09,091
     If this is street code,    
      it can't be complex.      

705
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,294
    Otherwise you wouldn't be   
  able to write it on one end,  

706
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:12,695
        and then read it        
          on the other.         

707
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:14,997
    [Hailey]: So think simple   
     instead of complicated.    

708
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:18,768
            Wrap it.            

709
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,870
          What are you          
         talking about?         

710
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:22,638
    A possible scytale code.    

711
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:24,206
            Try this.           

712
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,879
   [Iris]: Scytale is a simple  
      transposition cipher,     

713
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:32,748
   used by the ancient Greeks   
          and Spartans.         

714
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:34,684
  It's how military commanders  
        would communicate       

715
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:36,686
     with their front lines     
         during battle.         

716
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:38,054
         [Jean]: First,         
       a band of parchment      

717
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:40,189
   gets wrapped around a rod,   

718
00:27:40,224 --> 00:27:42,391
 then the message gets written. 

719
00:27:43,861 --> 00:27:45,728
        [Iris]: And when        
 the band of paper is unrolled, 

720
00:27:45,763 --> 00:27:47,063
     it becomes ciphertext.     

721
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:48,931
     [Jean]: The trick then     

722
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:50,766
       is to have a baton       
       in the battlefield       

723
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:52,034
   that matches the sender's.   

724
00:27:54,038 --> 00:27:55,137
             [Iris]:            
    Wrap the parchment right,   

725
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,940
            and boom,           
      there's your message.     

726
00:27:57,976 --> 00:27:59,141
             [Jean]:            
     This has the advantage     

727
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,309
      of being fast to make     

728
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,711
   and not prone to mistakes--  

729
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:05,781
         helpful things         
       when you're at war.      

730
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:07,149
             "H"...             

731
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,051
            A-N-D...            

732
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:11,620
            O-F-F...            

733
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:12,722
           "Hand-off."          

734
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:16,325
          C-E-D-A-R...          

735
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:20,830
           M-I-L-L...           

736
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,465
         "Cedar Mill..."        

737
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,400
             4-2...             

738
00:28:24,435 --> 00:28:27,336
           S... U-N...          

739
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:30,506
          7... P... M.          

740
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:33,709
           "Hand-off--          
         Cedar Mill 42,         

741
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:35,711
          Sun, 7 p.m."          

742
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:36,812
     Jean, you're a genius.     

743
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:38,414
         We've got it--         
       a time and a place.      

744
00:28:38,449 --> 00:28:39,382
         Brava, ladies.         

745
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:40,750
           What's 42?           

746
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:42,985
      I don't know, but...      
   but the meeting's tonight.   

747
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,286
        We really should        
        call the police.        

748
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:46,288
    [Iris]: There's too many    
       police on the take,      

749
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:48,090
     but if we can smoke out    
          these buyers,         

750
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:50,493
     we give them hard facts    
     that they can't deny--     

751
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:51,494
          their names,          

752
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:52,661
        their game plan.        

753
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:55,164
        Let's go hand off       
           some drugs.          

754
00:28:58,569 --> 00:29:00,536
             [Jean]:            
    You two find the dealer.    

755
00:29:00,571 --> 00:29:02,171
      We'll keep a lookout.     

756
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:14,216
             [Iris]:            
  Everyone off for the weekend. 

757
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,785
            Our gents           
       must've known that.      

758
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,186
            [Hailey]:           
     The sheds are numbered.    

759
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:21,323
         There's our 42.        

760
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:22,958
            That way.           

761
00:29:23,961 --> 00:29:25,094
           Good luck.           

762
00:29:25,129 --> 00:29:26,095
      Just keep an eye out.     

763
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:28,097
            Come on.            

764
00:29:28,132 --> 00:29:30,432
              [♪♪♪]             

765
00:29:37,241 --> 00:29:39,575
              [♪♪♪]             

766
00:29:52,523 --> 00:29:54,190
       [Hailey]: Hang on.       

767
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:55,958
           We're here.          

768
00:29:55,993 --> 00:29:58,227
    I don't think you ladies    
      got the right place.      

769
00:29:58,262 --> 00:30:00,863
          Oh, we do...          

770
00:30:00,898 --> 00:30:02,765
           and we come          
         bearing gifts.         

771
00:30:04,101 --> 00:30:07,336
          Not the kind          
     I usually pick up from.    

772
00:30:07,371 --> 00:30:08,938
         Takes all kinds        
         in this world.         

773
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,173
           And what's           
       on offer should be       

774
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:12,374
           of no less           
        interest to you.        

775
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,610
             [clang]            

776
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:18,013
     [man]: That's for sure.    

777
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:21,684
  I was staring down hot water  
       if you didn't show.      

778
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:24,587
            How long            
          has it been?          

779
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:25,888
          Oh, it's been         
         minutes, Iris.         

780
00:30:25,923 --> 00:30:26,956
        They'll be fine.        

781
00:30:30,761 --> 00:30:32,127
             Oh, no.            

782
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,330
     Oh, the guard's headed     
        toward the girls.       

783
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:36,165
         What happens if        
      he sees them dealing?     

784
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,700
          Oh, let's not         
            find out.           

785
00:30:37,735 --> 00:30:40,269
           Hey! Hello?          
       Yoo-hoo! Excuse me.      

786
00:30:41,806 --> 00:30:43,005
          Well, sir...          

787
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,440
      it's been a pleasure      
         doing business.        

788
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:45,841
        Tell your bosses        

789
00:30:45,876 --> 00:30:47,576
           to ease up           
      on the beatings now.      

790
00:30:50,414 --> 00:30:52,581
              Hey!              

791
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:54,483
        Someone tampered        
         with the goods.        

792
00:30:54,518 --> 00:30:56,185
           Just a bit           
       of quality control.      

793
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,487
         It's all there,        
           guaranteed.          

794
00:30:58,522 --> 00:30:59,822
              Back.             

795
00:30:59,857 --> 00:31:01,724
        [Jean]: Uh, sir!        
        Can you help us?        

796
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:02,658
            Our car.            

797
00:31:02,693 --> 00:31:04,693
         It broke down.         

798
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:06,328
             [Iris]:            
      Just over there, see?     

799
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,063
           We thought           
       we were out of gas,      

800
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:10,466
         but, um, we're         
         not out of gas.        

801
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:11,967
             [Iris]:            
    It could be the starter.    

802
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:13,002
         Or the battery.        

803
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,169
         Or the muffler.        

804
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,305
         Well, probably         
        not the muffler.        

805
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,806
           What're you          
       ladies doing here?

     that'll get you written    
       about in the news"?      

920
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:58,587
      Or "don't go putting      
  anything in there yourself."  

921
00:35:59,656 --> 00:36:01,456
       But what do I know?      

922
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:09,364
         Bottom to top?         

923
00:36:09,399 --> 00:36:10,765
           How do you           
         read that way?         

924
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:12,501
        I'm not reading.        

925
00:36:12,536 --> 00:36:15,537
     I'm detecting anomaly,     
    which the eye does faster   

926
00:36:15,572 --> 00:36:17,772
   when the mind isn't trying   
   to make sense of the words.  

927
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:19,941
          "Think less,          
         do more." Huh.         

928
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:21,610
             There.             

929
00:36:21,645 --> 00:36:22,677
              Look.             

930
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:24,379
            A cipher.           

931
00:36:24,414 --> 00:36:27,082
         This may get us        
    closer to those dealers.    

932
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:31,520
              [♪♪♪]             

933
00:36:45,235 --> 00:36:46,635
           Cracked it.          

934
00:36:47,771 --> 00:36:49,437
        Didn't take long.       

935
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:52,007
         Well, it's just        
    a simple Caesar cipher--    

936
00:36:52,042 --> 00:36:54,309
     every letter transposed    
      three letters ahead--     

937
00:36:54,344 --> 00:36:56,144
           "A" is "D,"          
           "B" is "E."          

938
00:36:56,179 --> 00:36:57,178
             Smart.             

939
00:36:57,214 --> 00:36:59,414
    Gaius Julius thought so.    

940
00:36:59,449 --> 00:37:01,383
     It's one of the oldest     
       ciphers in history,      

941
00:37:01,418 --> 00:37:03,285
        simple enough for       
   the average person to use.   

942
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,486
         What's it say?         

943
00:37:04,521 --> 00:37:05,987
         The tough part         
      is the abbreviations,     

944
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:07,856
        but essentially,        
        it's a warning--        

945
00:37:07,891 --> 00:37:09,491
             telling            
         "all able men"         

946
00:37:09,526 --> 00:37:11,126
            to beware           

947
00:37:11,161 --> 00:37:13,361
   of someone else's messages   
  in the "Help Wanted" section. 

948
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,931
          To "Stay out          
         of the papers,"        

949
00:37:15,966 --> 00:37:17,966
            or else.            

950
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:26,708
           Jean! Jean?          

951
00:37:26,743 --> 00:37:28,843
             Millie!            

952
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:33,481
            Oh, God.            

953
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:35,517
         What happened?         

954
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,054
    Who would do this to him?   

955
00:37:39,089 --> 00:37:40,121
           It doesn't           
           make sense.          

956
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:41,790
          We delivered          
           the package          

957
00:37:41,825 --> 00:37:43,358
           to the men           
         who wanted it.         

958
00:37:43,393 --> 00:37:46,428
          That was not          
      what they were after.     

959
00:37:46,463 --> 00:37:48,530
       We haven't stopped       
          the beatings.         

960
00:37:48,565 --> 00:37:51,299
     There's another reason     
       for these attacks.       

961
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:53,768
         [Jean]: And one        
      we've seen before...      

962
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,047
 [Edward takes a deeper breath] 

963
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,987
             Tell me            
     you're not Saint Peter.    

964
00:38:13,023 --> 00:38:14,589
            That'd be           
         your lucky day.        

965
00:38:14,624 --> 00:38:17,125
     I'd let anyone through     
       those pearly gates.      

966
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,761
         [weak chuckle]         

967
00:38:19,796 --> 00:38:22,497
          [sighs] Last          
        thing I remember,       

968
00:38:22,532 --> 00:38:23,732
          I was locking         
          my front door         

969
00:38:23,767 --> 00:38:25,500
           on the way           
          to the bank.          

970
00:38:25,535 --> 00:38:26,701
         You were found         

971
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:28,536
     beaten up in an alley.     

972
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:30,305
        Just like Rusty.        

973
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,207
        It was a mugging.       

974
00:38:32,242 --> 00:38:34,042
       Welcome to America.      

975
00:38:34,077 --> 00:38:35,777
          Oh, come on,          
             Edward.            

976
00:38:35,812 --> 00:38:38,213
          I don't care          
       what you're up to,       

977
00:38:38,248 --> 00:38:39,681
      but if we don't know      

978
00:38:39,716 --> 00:38:41,483
        why these attacks       
        are taking place,       

979
00:38:41,518 --> 00:38:42,984
       we can't stop them.      

980
00:38:44,254 --> 00:38:47,322
    If you won't talk to me,    

981
00:38:47,357 --> 00:38:49,457
           please talk          
         to the police.         

982
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,626
          Oh, Camilla,          
        for God's sake...       

983
00:38:51,661 --> 00:38:53,027
       There's a detective      
            outside,            

984
00:38:53,063 --> 00:38:54,095
        he's a good man.        

985
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:55,730
            Except in           
      the eyes of the law,      

986
00:38:55,765 --> 00:38:57,365
     I'm also breaking one.     

987
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,733
            And what            
         have you done?         

988
00:38:58,768 --> 00:39:01,803
            It's not            
         what I've done.        

989
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:03,872
         It's who I am.         

990
00:39:05,008 --> 00:39:07,175
         You've no idea         
        why I left home.        

991
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,347
         I believe I do.        

992
00:39:13,583 --> 00:39:15,683
           "The heart           
      is a lonely hunter,"      

993
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:17,619
      as the book puts it.      

994
00:39:17,654 --> 00:39:20,755
       You came here to be      
     the man you need to be.    

995
00:39:21,691 --> 00:39:22,724
          I understand.         

996
00:39:23,793 --> 00:39:26,561
       [sighs] You don't.       

997
00:39:26,596 --> 00:39:29,497
        You may have once       
      ran off with a man...     

998
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,733
         but at least...        

999
00:39:31,768 --> 00:39:33,234
          he was a man.         

1000
00:39:35,438 --> 00:39:38,907
      They weren't all men.     

1001
00:39:40,243 --> 00:39:41,709
        Really, the only        
          difference is         

1002
00:39:41,745 --> 00:39:43,411
          when it comes         
          to the hunt,          

1003
00:39:43,446 --> 00:39:45,680
           I enjoy it.          

1004
00:39:45,715 --> 00:39:48,483
    [both chuckling quietly]    

1005
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,520
         [Iris]: There's        
    a whole series of them--    

1006
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:55,657
 encrypted messages in the, uh, 
      "help wanted" section     

1007
00:39:55,692 --> 00:39:56,958
        of the newspaper.       

1008
00:39:56,993 --> 00:39:58,226
          Folks talking         
         to each other,         

1009
00:39:58,261 --> 00:39:59,894
     right under our noses.     

1010
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:01,229
    Sounds like a latter-day    
          agony column.         

1011
00:40:01,264 --> 00:40:03,464
     What's an agony column?    

1012
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,899
     Oh, they've been around    
     since Victorian times.     

1013
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:07,802
    Secret messages encrypted   
       in the classifieds,      

1014
00:40:07,837 --> 00:40:09,103
          so to arrange         
          a rendezvous.         

1015
00:40:09,139 --> 00:40:12,173
      For people too afraid     
      to pick up the phone      

1016
00:40:12,208 --> 00:40:13,908
       or write a letter.       

1017
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:15,310
          Yes. Only...          

1018
00:40:15,345 --> 00:40:17,745
       This time, I think       
    it's a for group of men,    

1019
00:40:17,781 --> 00:40:19,814
         to... connect.         

1020
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:23,017
    How would you know this?    

1021
00:40:23,053 --> 00:40:25,286
   [Jean]: I worked for a man   
         who kept me on         

1022
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:27,221
 for a few years after the war. 

1023
00:40:27,257 --> 00:40:29,557
   A brilliant cryptographer.   

1024
00:40:29,592 --> 00:40:31,926
  He'd cracked the Enigma code, 

1025
00:40:31,962 --> 00:40:35,763
  invented computing devices... 

1026
00:40:35,799 --> 00:40:38,299
             and...             

1027
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:40,268
        and he loved men.       

1028
00:40:41,771 --> 00:40:43,705
      Here, that's a crime.     

1029
00:40:44,741 --> 00:40:47,175
        Well, yes, it is        
      back in Britain, too.     

1030
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:50,611
   Like the codes he cracked,   
  he was hidden in plain sight, 

1031
00:40:50,647 --> 00:40:53,014
   until the police found out.  

1032
00:40:53,049 --> 00:40:54,816
        He'd called them        

1033
00:40:54,851 --> 00:40:57,218
    because he'd been robbed    
       by one of his, um,       

1034
00:40:57,253 --> 00:40:59,454
       visiting gentleman.      

1035
00:41:01,057 --> 00:41:03,691
     When the world saw him     
       for what he was...       

1036
00:41:06,463 --> 00:41:08,496
     ...they destroyed him.     

1037
00:41:15,972 --> 00:41:19,574
  So you think our men are like 
  this man that you worked for? 

1038
00:41:19,609 --> 00:41:22,110
               Mm.              

1039
00:41:22,145 --> 00:41:25,012
          And they feel         
    that they're in danger--    

1040
00:41:25,048 --> 00:41:27,615
 and clearly, with good reason.

1042

          I can see why         
         you chose him.         

1043
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:42,163
          Because he's          
      a fine investigator--     

1044
00:41:42,198 --> 00:41:44,232
          Mr. Harcourt.         

1045

1046
00:41:46,903 --> 00:41:49,036
         a thing or two         
           to tell me.          

1047
00:41:50,807 --> 00:41:53,374
       I'll take my leave.

           Gentlemen.           

1049
00:41:59,616 --> 00:42:01,549
       As I told Camilla,       
     I've no recollection--     

1050
00:42:01,584 --> 00:42:02,784
       I'm not interested       
            in today.           

1051
00:42:02,819 --> 00:42:04,852
      It's the weeks before     
       I wanna know about.      

1052
00:42:04,888 --> 00:42:06,220
          I understand          

1053
00:42:06,256 --> 00:42:08,956
    there are some bad people   
     you'd like to catch...     

1054
00:42:09,993 --> 00:42:11,325
        But if you don't,       

1055
00:42:11,361 --> 00:42:16,097
    and I've shared the truth   
         about myself...        

1056
00:42:16,132 --> 00:42:17,999
 I still have to pay the price. 

1057
00:42:18,034 --> 00:42:21,335
     In the eyes of the law,    
      I'm a criminal, too,      

1058
00:42:21,371 --> 00:42:22,937
 as bad as the man who beat me. 

1059
00:42:22,972 --> 00:42:26,440
  Well, I doubt he's as clever  
            and good.           

1060
00:42:26,476 --> 00:42:27,575
           Detective,           

1061
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:29,577

1062
00:42:29,612 --> 00:42:31,612
          And flirting.         

1063
00:42:31,648 --> 00:42:33,080
       That's not cricket.      

1064

      Whatever you tell me,     

1065
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:40,188
         I will take it         
      to the right people.      

1066
00:42:40,223 --> 00:42:42,523
   You will see justice done.   

1067

         I sure hope so.

      Good morning, Sarge.      

1070
00:42:53,002 --> 00:42:56,804
 Oh, it's a quiet morning here, 
            for once.           

1071
00:42:56,839 --> 00:42:59,740
   [Hailey]: The boys are off   
      to some coffee shop.      

1072

        I tell you, next        
  to hearing themselves squawk, 

1073
00:43:01,678 --> 00:43:04,712
       the next best thing      
  is listening to someone else. 

1074

       Don't worry, Sarge.      

1075

      I know how to put it      
      back together again.      

1076
00:43:15,091 --> 00:43:16,524
              Good.             

1077
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:20,061
   Oh, I went by the newspaper  
      offices this morning      

1078
00:43:20,096 --> 00:43:22,229
  and picked up what's come up  
   on your "for rent" listing.  

1079
00:43:22,265 --> 00:43:23,197
            Already?            

1080
00:43:23,232 --> 00:43:24,332
   Oh, I wrote you a good ad.   

1081
00:43:24,367 --> 00:43:27,969
           Oh, this is          
         gonna be good.         

1082
00:43:28,004 --> 00:43:29,837
          Just think...         

1083
00:43:29,872 --> 00:43:31,739
     one of these gals could    
       end up living here.      

1084
00:43:31,774 --> 00:43:33,341
          So be careful         
         who you let in.        

1085
00:43:33,376 --> 00:43:35,743
       Look at this one--       
      "loves to converse."      

1086
00:43:35,778 --> 00:43:38,646
         Uh, that means         
   "insufferably opinionated."  

1087
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:42,817
         Or this one...         
          "easy-going."         

1088
00:43:42,852 --> 00:43:45,252
           That means           
       "slovenly as hell."      

1089
00:43:46,823 --> 00:43:48,022
            I wonder            
        what I'd put down       

1090

            if I had            
       to describe myself.

      HE EMIGRATED TO

HEURICH BREWERY IN 1873.        

1182

   A GERMAN CASTLE.             

1189
00:51:09,865 --> 00:51:12,833

00:54:41,109 --> 00:54:44,611
    AND SO THAT'S KIND OF,      
    I THINK, A TRIBUTE TO HIM   

1256
00:54:44,613 --> 00:54:46,646
        AND MY MOM, TOO.        

1257
00:54:46,648 --> 00:54:48,948
    STREET ART, YOU KNOW,       
    WHEN I WAS YOUNGER,         

1258
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:50,383
    WASN'T CALLED THAT.         

1259
00:54:50,385 --> 00:54:52,619
    IT WAS JUST VANDALISM.      

1260
00:54:52,621 --> 00:54:55,288
A LOT OF ARTISTS WERE PUTTING   
  UP ARTWORK ON THE STREET      

1261
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:58,491
   AS A WAY TO GET IT SHOWN,    
   JUST TO SHOW TO EACH OTHER.  

1262
00:54:58,493 --> 00:55:04,130
   NOW THE BUILDING DEVELOPERS  
   HAVE BOUGHT ALL THOSE        
   BUILDINGS IN D.C.,           

1263
00:55:04,132 --> 00:55:08,067
AND THEY ACTUALLY HIRE US-TYPE  
        STREET ARTISTS          

1264
00:55:08,069 --> 00:55:10,236
      TO ACTUALLY COME IN       
AND DECORATE THE NEW PROPERTY,  

1265
00:55:10,238 --> 00:55:13,139
    WHICH IS REALLY AN          
    INTERESTING EVOLUTION.      

1266
00:55:13,141 --> 00:55:16,576
     I LIKE SEEING GRAFFITI.    
     IT'S A SIGN OF LIFE.       

1267
00:55:16,578 --> 00:55:20,446
IT'S A SIGN OF PEOPLE TAKING    
OWNERSHIP OF THEIR OWN SPACE.   

1268
00:55:20,448 --> 00:55:22,682
AND WHILE I'M A BUILDING OWNER  
        AND I'D BE MAD          

1269
00:55:22,684 --> 00:55:24,150
        IF SOMEONE TAGGED       
   THE FRONT OF MY BUILDING--   

1270
00:55:24,152 --> 00:55:25,718
    WHATEVER. I CAN JUST        
        PAINT OVER IT           

1271
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:28,054
    AND KNOW, ULTIMATELY,       
    IT'S NOT REALLY HARMFUL.    

1272
00:55:28,056 --> 00:55:33,159
ANNOUNCER: THE FRIDGE IS OPEN   
THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY         
AND IS FREE TO THE PUBLIC.      

1273
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:48,641
ANNOUNCER: CRUMBS & WHISKERS    
     OPENED IN JUNE 2015        

1274
00:55:48,643 --> 00:55:52,478
    AS WASHINGTON D.C.'S        
    FIRST CAT CAFE.             

1275
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,280
        IT'S A PLACE            
        WHERE YOU COME IN       

1276
00:55:54,282 --> 00:55:57,684
    AND YOU CAN HANG OUT WITH   
    ABOUT 20 ADOPTABLE CATS     

1277
00:55:57,686 --> 00:56:01,921
    AND ALSO GET COFFEE, TEA,   
    CAKES, THINGS LIKE THAT.    

1278
00:56:01,923 --> 00:56:04,724
I THINK GEORGETOWN IS A GREAT   
    PLACE FOR A CAT CAFE        

1279
00:56:04,726 --> 00:56:09,662
    BECAUSE IT KIND OF HAS      
    THE SAME PERSONALITY THAT   
    A CAT CAFE WOULD HAVE,      

1280
00:56:09,664 --> 00:56:13,700
WHICH IS QUIRKY AND ECLECTIC    
   AND ALSO A DESTINATION.      

1281
00:56:13,702 --> 00:56:16,569
MAN: WE DO HAVE SOME CUSTOMERS  
THAT COME FROM OUT OF STATE.    

1282
00:56:16,571 --> 00:56:18,871
WE'VE HAD PEOPLE FROM DALLAS,   
     FROM MASSACHUSETTS,        

1283
00:56:18,873 --> 00:56:21,441
        FROM KENTUCKY,          
         UM, ALL OVER.          

1284
00:56:21,443 --> 00:56:25,545
       ANNOUNCER: CRUMBS &      
     WHISKERS IS FOSTER HOME    
       FOR ADOPTABLE CATS       

1285
00:56:25,547 --> 00:56:28,748
    FROM THE LOST DOG AND CAT   
    RESCUE FOUNDATION.          

1286
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:31,684
CRUMPLER: OUR GOAL IS TO JUST   
OFFER A PLACE WHERE CATS CAN    

1287
00:56:31,686 --> 00:56:35,254
BE OUTSIDE OF CAGES AND LIVE    
   IN AN OPEN ENVIRONMENT.      

1288
00:56:35,256 --> 00:56:38,558
WE LIKE TO JOKE THAT WE HAVE    
ORGANIC, FREE-RANGE CATS.       

1289
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:42,362
SINGH: CATS THAT ARE SOCIALS    
  ARE THE ONLY KIND OF CATS     
        WE PUT HERE.            

1290
00:56:42,364 --> 00:56:45,832
AND IT'S GREAT BECAUSE THEY'RE  
THE ONES THAT STRUGGLE MOST     
IN A SHELTER ENVIRONMENT        

1291
00:56:45,834 --> 00:56:48,034
     BECAUSE THE ISOLATION      
    HITS THEM THE HARDEST.      

1292
00:56:48,036 --> 00:56:50,870
CRUMPLER: EACH CAT DEFINITELY   
  HAS ITS OWN PERSONALITY.      

1293
00:56:50,872 --> 00:56:52,305
ALL OF THEM ARE SO DIFFERENT.   

1294
00:56:52,307 --> 00:56:55,208
    SINGH: IS IT A SASSY CAT?   
       IS IT A CHILL CAT?       

1295
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:57,543
    IS IT A PLAYFUL CAT?        
     IS IT A SLEEPY CAT?        

1296
00:56:57,545 --> 00:56:59,212
        IS IT A DIVA CAT?       

1297
00:57:03,852 --> 00:57:09,088
     WE'VE HAD 42 ADOPTIONS,    
     AND RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE     
     ANOTHER 4 IN PROCESS.      

1298
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:13,526
    ANNOUNCER: DUE TO ITS       
    OVERWHELMING POPULARITY WITH
    LOCALS AND TOURISTS ALIKE,  

1299
00:57:13,528 --> 00:57:16,562
CRUMBS & WHISKERS STRONGLY      
SUGGESTS MAKING RESERVATIONS.   

1300
00:57:16,564 --> 00:57:19,365
    CRUMPLER: WE'VE BEEN        
    VERY BUSY SO FAR.           

1301
00:57:19,367 --> 00:57:22,201
     SINGH: OUR WEEKENDS        
    ARE ALWAYS SOLD OUT.        

1302
00:57:22,203 --> 00:57:25,905
ANNOUNCER: CUSTOMERS VISIT THE  
CAFE TO GET THEIR CAT FIX.      

1303
00:57:25,907 --> 00:57:27,407
            I USED TO HAVE A CAT
            FOR A LONG TIME,    

1304
00:57:27,409 --> 00:57:29,208
        AND THEN HE PASSED      
        AWAY A FEW YEARS AGO.   

1305
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:31,677
        SO I WAS KIND OF--      
        WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT   
        THEY HAD THEM,          

1306
00:57:31,679 --> 00:57:33,446
        HAD THIS HERE,          
        I HAD TO GO.            

1307
00:57:33,448 --> 00:57:36,315
YOU SEEM LIKE YOU COULD BE      
A GOOD MOUSER.                  

1308
00:57:36,317 --> 00:57:38,151
                HA HA HA HA!    

1309
00:57:38,153 --> 00:57:40,253
I THINK BEING ABLE TO, LIKE,    
   INTERACT WITH ANIMALS,       

1310
00:57:40,255 --> 00:57:41,721
        EVEN FOR A SHORT        
         AMOUNT OF TIME.        

1311
00:57:41,723 --> 00:57:43,222
HELPS BOTH ANIMALS AND HUMANS.  

1312
00:57:43,224 --> 00:57:45,758
IT'S BEEN PROVEN THAT, LIKE,    
SPENDING TIME WITH ANIMALS      

1313
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,660
    CAN, LIKE, IMPROVE MOODS    
    AND DECREASE STRESS.        

1314
00:57:47,662 --> 00:57:51,130
    WOMAN: IT'S VERY COZY       
AND VERY WARM AND WELCOMING.    

1315
00:57:51,132 --> 00:57:53,199
    IT'S JUST REALLY NICE TO    
    BE ABLE TO SPEND TIME       

1316
00:57:53,201 --> 00:57:55,802
    WITH THESE VERY--VERY       
    WELL-TRAINED CATS           

1317
00:57:55,804 --> 00:57:58,271
    WHO ARE VERY USED TO        
    PEOPLE--HA HA!              

1318
00:57:58,273 --> 00:58:02,775
SINGH: SOME PEOPLE COME HERE    
    BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY       
       WANT TO ADOPT.

 REALLY HOPE THAT THEY FIND,
