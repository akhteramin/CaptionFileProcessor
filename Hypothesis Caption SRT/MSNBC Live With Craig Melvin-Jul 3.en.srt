>> THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT 
ISSUES THAT ARE GOING ON HERE.  

1290
00:42:16,735 --> 00:42:18,334
ISSUES THAT ARE GOING ON HERE.  
FIRST, WE SEE AGAIN, THAT THE   

1291
00:42:18,336 --> 00:42:20,136
FIRST, WE SEE AGAIN, THAT THE   
PRESIDENT IS COMPLETELY AT ODDS 

1292
00:42:20,138 --> 00:42:21,671
PRESIDENT IS COMPLETELY AT ODDS 
WITH OTHER FACTIONS OR OTHER    

1293
00:42:21,673 --> 00:42:22,805
WITH OTHER FACTIONS OR OTHER    
AGENCIES OR DIVISIONS,          

1294
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:24,541
AGENCIES OR DIVISIONS,          
DEPARTMENTS WITHIN HIS OWN      

1295
00:42:24,543 --> 00:42:25,008
DEPARTMENTS WITHIN HIS OWN      
ADMINISTRATION.                 

1296
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:26,543
ADMINISTRATION.                 
SO IT RAISES THE QUESTION, YOU  

1297
00:42:26,545 --> 00:42:27,610
SO IT RAISES THE QUESTION, YOU  
KNOW, WHO'S IN CHARGE HERE?     

1298
00:42:27,612 --> 00:42:28,745
KNOW, WHO'S IN CHARGE HERE?     
WHO'S RUNNING THE SHOW?         

1299
00:42:28,747 --> 00:42:30,213
WHO'S RUNNING THE SHOW?         
THE OTHER THING TOO THAT I THINK

1300
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:32,081
THE OTHER THING TOO THAT I THINK
IS IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND IS 

1301
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:33,483
IS IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND IS 
THAT THE PRESIDENT IS           

1302
00:42:33,485 --> 00:42:34,784
THAT THE PRESIDENT IS           
ESSENTIALLY SAYING, AND THIS MAY

1303
00:42:34,786 --> 00:42:39,389
ESSENTIALLY SAYING, AND THIS MAY
BE SABER RAD RATTLING AND       

1304
00:42:39,391 --> 00:42:40,757
BE SABER RAD RATTLING AND       
SHOWING A HARD POLITICAL MESSAGE

1305
00:42:40,759 --> 00:42:42,926
SHOWING A HARD POLITICAL MESSAGE
THAT HE MEANS BUSINESS,TOR MAY  

1306
00:42:42,928 --> 00:42:43,560
THAT HE MEANS BUSINESS,TOR MAY  
BE SERIOUS.

00:42:43,562 --> 00:42:44,827
BE SERIOUS.                     
BUT HE'S SPECIALLY SAYING I'M   

1308
00:42:44,829 --> 00:42:46,062
BUT HE'S SPECIALLY SAYING I'M   
GOING TO GO AGAINST THIS AND GO 

1309
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:47,864
GOING TO GO AGAINST THIS AND GO 
AGAINST THE COURT'S RULING AND  

1310
00:42:47,866 --> 00:42:49,732
AGAINST THE COURT'S RULING AND  
MY OWN JUST DEPARTMENT AND I'M  

1311
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:51,267
MY OWN JUST DEPARTMENT AND I'M  
GOING TO ENSURE THAT THAT       

1312
00:42:51,269 --> 00:42:52,969
GOING TO ENSURE THAT THAT       
QUESTION FINDS ITS WAY ON THERE.

1313
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:54,571
QUESTION FINDS ITS WAY ON THERE.
SO HE'S PROMISING TO REALLY

NOW, CAN HE DO THAT?            

1318
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:02,545
NOW, CAN HE DO THAT?            
IT'S NOT EXACTLY CLEAR.         

1319
00:43:02,547 --> 00:43:03,780
IT'S NOT EXACTLY CLEAR.         
HOW WOULD HE DO THAT.           

1320
00:43:03,782 --> 00:43:05,014
HOW WOULD HE DO THAT.           
BUT HE'S ESSENTIALLY PROMISING  

1321
00:43:05,016 --> 00:43:05,381
BUT HE'S ESSENTIALLY PROMISING  
DO THAT.

DO THAT.                        
AND THAT IS CAUSE FOR CONCERN.  

1323
00:43:07,052 --> 00:43:08,851
AND THAT IS CAUSE FOR CONCERN.

MAYBE WE SHOULD REMIND THEM WHY 
IS IT THAT THIS PRESIDENT FINDS 

1331

IS IT THAT THIS PRESIDENT FINDS 
THE CITIZENSHIP QUESTION ITSELF,

1332
00:43:21,533 --> 00:43:24,033
THE CITIZENSHIP QUESTION ITSELF,
WHY DOES HE WANT THIS TO BE A

POLITICAL REASONS FOR THIS,     

1337
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:30,773
POLITICAL REASONS FOR THIS,     
CRAIG.                          

1338
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:33,042

IS RESEARCH THAT WOULD SAY THAT 

1341
00:43:36,615 --> 00:43:40,617
IS RESEARCH THAT WOULD SAY THAT 
IT WOULD ACTUALLY WORK TO       

1342
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:42,385
IT WOULD ACTUALLY WORK TO       
SUPPRESS PARTICIPATION IN THE   

1343
00:43:42,387 --> 00:43:44,253
SUPPRESS PARTICIPATION IN THE   
CENSUS AND GET AN UNDERCOUNT    

1344
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:46,422
CENSUS AND GET AN UNDERCOUNT    
PARTICULARLY NOT JUST OF PEOPLE 

1345
00:43:46,424 --> 00:43:49,325
PARTICULARLY NOT JUST OF PEOPLE 
WHO ARE IMMIGRANTS, BUT EVEN    

1346
00:43:49,327 --> 00:43:51,394
WHO ARE IMMIGRANTS, BUT EVEN    
CITIZENS WHO ARE RELATED TO

MIXED IMMIGRATION STATUS WITHIN 
THEIR HOUSEHOLD.                

1350
00:43:56,601 --> 00:44:01,738
THEIR HOUSEHOLD.                
THERE WILL BE A FEAR THAT       

1351
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,172
THERE WILL BE A FEAR THAT

PARTICIPATING IN THE CENSUS     

1353
00:44:03,908 --> 00:44:04,574
PARTICIPATING IN THE CENSUS     
COULD GET THEM IN TROUBLE.      

1354
00:44:04,576 --> 00:44:05,975
COULD GET THEM IN TROUBLE.      
WE HAVE SEEN THROUGHOUT

WE HAVE SEEN THROUGHOUT         
DOCUMENTATION AND THE LITIGATION

OVER THE CENSUS THERE ARE SOME  
FOLKS WHO KNOW THAT THAT WOULD  

1358
00:44:09,614 --> 00:44:11,114
FOLKS WHO KNOW THAT THAT WOULD  
HURT DEMOCRATS IN AN ELECTION.  

1359
00:44:11,116 --> 00:44:12,682
HURT DEMOCRATS IN AN ELECTION.  
I MEAN, THE CENSUS DECIDES A LOT

1360
00:44:12,684 --> 00:44:14,317
I MEAN, THE CENSUS DECIDES A LOT
OF THINGS FROM CONGRESSIONAL    

1361
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:15,518
OF THINGS FROM CONGRESSIONAL    
DISTRICTS TO FEDERAL FUNDING,   

1362
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,520
DISTRICTS TO FEDERAL FUNDING,   
BUT IT WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON   

1363
00:44:17,522 --> 00:44:21,224
BUT IT WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON   
THE ELECTION COULD A DEPRESSED  

1364
00:44:21,226 --> 00:44:23,259
THE ELECTION COULD A DEPRESSED  
TURNOUT AND DEPRESS THE STRENGTH

1365
00:44:23,261 --> 00:44:24,394
TURNOUT AND DEPRESS THE STRENGTH
OF THE DEMOCRATIC DISTRICTS.    

1366
00:44:24,396 --> 00:44:27,263
OF THE DEMOCRATIC DISTRICTS.    
SO THERE'S A POLITICAL INCENTIVE

1367
00:44:27,265 --> 00:44:27,563
SO THERE'S A POLITICAL INCENTIVE
HERE.

1547
00:51:37,628 --> 00:51:38,561
 I have one kid in each branch  
        of the military,        

1548
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:39,795
    but I'm command central.    

1549
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,432
    It's so important to us     
          that Verizon          

1550
00:51:43,468 --> 00:51:45,101
is supporting military families.

1551
00:51:45,136 --> 00:51:46,502
 When I have a child deployed,  

1552
00:51:46,537 --> 00:51:48,604
   having a reliable network    
       means everything.        

1553
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:49,738
  So, when I get a video chat,  

1554
00:51:49,774 --> 00:51:51,540
  and I get to see their face,  

1555
00:51:51,576 --> 00:51:52,775
      it's the best thing       
         in the world.          

1556
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:54,510
   And I've earned every one    
      of these gray hairs.      

1557
00:51:54,545 --> 00:51:56,745
  Military moms, we serve too.

00:51:56,781 --> 00:51:58,881
              (VO)              
The network more people rely on,
        gives you more.         

1559
00:51:58,916 --> 00:52:01,383
    Like military plans with    
 a special price on Unlimited,  

1560
00:52:01,419 --> 00:52:03,486
 $100 per line, and big savings 

1561
00:52:03,521 --> 00:52:05,221
       on our best phones       
        when you switch.        

1562
00:52:05,256 --> 00:52:06,105
        That's Verizon.         

1563
00:52:08,809 --> 00:52:10,559
    Think all premium fuels     
         are the same?          

1564
00:52:10,611 --> 00:52:13,646
New Shell V-Power NiTRO+ Premium
    Gasoline is engineered      

1565
00:52:13,681 --> 00:52:15,114
  with four levels of defense   
            against             

1566
00:52:15,149 --> 00:52:19,068
   gunk, wear, corrosion and    
           friction.            

1567
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,787
  That helps keep your engine   
       running like new.        

1568
00:52:23,124 --> 00:52:24,874
 So, maybe it's time to unthink 
        what you think          

1569
00:52:24,909 --> 00:52:27,293
