    When you're not fighting    
    through migraine            

436
00:20:27,385 --> 00:20:29,219
   imagine the possibilities.   

437
00:20:29,321 --> 00:20:32,288
 Once-monthly Emgality is used  
 for the prevention             

438
00:20:32,324 --> 00:20:33,556
     of migraine in adults.     

439
00:20:33,658 --> 00:20:35,692
 It's specifically developed to 
 help give you                  

440
00:20:35,727 --> 00:20:37,327
    more migraine-free days.    

441
00:20:37,562 --> 00:20:40,797
 With Emgality about 60% of     
 people had their migraine days 

442
00:20:40,832 --> 00:20:42,065
      cut in half or more.      

443
00:20:42,167 --> 00:20:45,001
Do not use if you are allergic  
to Emgality or its ingredients.

five-year cancer survivor.      

456
00:21:08,327 --> 00:21:11,695
    Surviving for five years    
         is a big deal.

458
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,001
  helping me find a way to go   
    through the treatments.     

459
00:21:18,003 --> 00:21:21,004
    The reality of cancer is    
    not everybody survives.     

460
00:21:21,006 --> 00:21:22,806
            At CTCA,

   imagine the possibilities.   

1431
00:59:32,562 --> 00:59:35,529
 Once-monthly Emgality is used  
 for the prevention             

1432
00:59:35,565 --> 00:59:36,797
     of migraine in adults.     

1433
00:59:36,899 --> 00:59:38,933
 It's specifically developed to 
 help give you                  

1434
00:59:38,968 --> 00:59:40,568
    more migraine-free days.    

1435
00:59:40,803 --> 00:59:44,038
 With Emgality about 60% of     
 people had their migraine days 

1436
00:59:44,073 --> 00:59:45,306
      cut in half or more.      

1437
00:59:45,408 --> 00:59:48,242
Do not use if you are allergic  
to Emgality or its ingredients. 

1438
00:59:49,479 --> 00:59:51,512
  Emgality may cause allergic   
  reactions, such as            

1439
00:59:51,547 --> 00:59:53,614
    itching, rash, hives and    
    trouble breathing,          

1440
00:59:53,649 --> 00:59:55,149
which can happen days after use.

1441
00:59:55,451 --> 00:59:57,184
Call your doctor or get medical 
help right away
