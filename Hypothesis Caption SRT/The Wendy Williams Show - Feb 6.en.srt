  Imagine what you can do with  
  more migraine-free days.

    When you're not fighting    
    through migraine            

1405
00:59:05,704 --> 00:59:07,537
   imagine the possibilities.   

1406
00:59:07,639 --> 00:59:10,607
 Once-monthly Emgality is used  
 for the prevention             

1407
00:59:10,642 --> 00:59:11,874

 help give you                  

1409
00:59:14,045 --> 00:59:15,645
    more migraine-free days.    

1410
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:19,115
 With Emgality about 60% of     
 people had their migraine days 

1411
00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:20,383
      cut in half or more.      

1412
00:59:20,485 --> 00:59:23,319
Do not use if you are allergic  
to Emgality or its ingredients. 

1413
00:59:24,556 --> 00:59:26,589
  Emgality may cause allergic   
  reactions, such as            

1414
00:59:26,625 --> 00:59:28,691
    itching, rash, hives and    
    trouble breathing,          

1415
00:59:28,727 --> 00:59:30,226
which can happen days after use.

1416
00:59:30,528 --> 00:59:32,262
Call your doctor or get medical 
help right away                 

1417
00:59:32,297 --> 00:59:34,230
   if you have symptoms of an   
   allergic reaction.           

1418
00:59:34,266 --> 00:59:35,598
      The most common side      
      effects include           

1419
00:59:35,634 --> 00:59:37,033
   injection site reactions.
