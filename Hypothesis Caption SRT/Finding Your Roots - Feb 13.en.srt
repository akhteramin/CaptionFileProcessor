       WEALTHY LANDOWNERS,

  THEY DIDN'T HAVE PROPERTIES   
  OR ANYTHING AT STAKE IN CUBA,

00:00:07,708 --> 00:00:10,442

 GO JUST AN HOUR NORTH AND THEN

00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:12,845
  GET A BETTER LIFE UH, FOR     
  THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILY,  

5
00:00:12,913 --> 00:00:15,714
    VERY TYPICAL THING THAT     
    DREW PEOPLE HERE FOREVER.

          RUBIO: IT IS.         

8
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:19,785
  IT'S A BIG JUMP AND I'M       
  SURE THOSE EARLY YEARS WERE,  

9
00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:21,720
    WERE DIFFICULT FOR THEM.

   YORK TO MIAMI TO LAS VEGAS,

 WORKING IN CASINOS AND HOTELS. 

13
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:35,701
    IT WAS AN IMMENSE EFFORT.   

14
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:39,104
  BUT EVEN SO, THE COUPLE TOOK  
  GREAT CARE TO MAKE SURE THAT  

15

      THEIR CHILDREN DIDN'T     
      SEE THEIR EXPERIENCE

     GROWING UP FEELING LIKE    

18

     DAD WAS A BARTENDER AND

00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:51,517
     MY MOM WORKED AS A MAID    
     AT THE IMPERIAL PALACE.    

20
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:54,686
  SOMEHOW THEY WERE ABLE TO     
  INSTILL IN US THE BELIEF THAT 

21
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:56,488
     THERE WAS NOBODY WE        
     SAW ON TELEVISION THAT

  GATES: THAT'S FABULOUS.       
  MY PARENTS WERE THE SAME WAY. 

24
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:02,628
     THERE WAS NOTHING THAT     
     WE COULD ASPIRE TO THAT    

25
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:03,729
      WE COULD NOT ACHIEVE.

  GATES: BUT WHERE DO YOU THINK 
  IT CAME FROM IN YOUR CASE?    

30
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:09,701
    RUBIO: I DON'T KNOW, UM.

 CRAZY WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT. 

32

    JUST KIND OF THE POINT OF   

33
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:13,238
        MY PARENTS' LIFE.       

34
00:01:13,307 --> 00:01:14,773
       THEY TRIED A LOT OF      
       DIFFERENT THINGS,        

35
00:01:14,842 --> 00:01:16,809

 WE WOULD HAVE THE CHANCE TO DO 

36
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:18,644
       THINGS THEY NEVER        
       HAD A CHANCE TO DO,      

37
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:20,679

    THEY NEVER HAD A SPECIFIC   

38
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:23,282
   DREAM FOR US, THEY JUST      
   WANTED US TO HAVE A DREAM,   

39
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,551
      WHATEVER THAT WAS,

    INTENSELY GRATEFUL TO HIS

  PARENTS, AND SEES HIS SUCCESS 
  AS A VALIDATION OF THE CHOICE 

47
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:54,680
    THEY MADE IN IMMIGRATING,

        YOUR FAMILY ISN'T

61
00:02:30,918 --> 00:02:33,585
        AND FOLLOWED THAT       
       SAME PATH HERSELF.

00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:37,623
     SHE JOINED THE ARMY        
     NATIONAL GUARD IN 2003,    

63
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:40,325
   WHEN SHE WAS 22 YEARS OLD.   

64
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:44,296
   THE NEXT YEAR, THE MAJORITY  
  OF HER UNIT WAS SELECTED FOR

00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:47,499
        SERVICE IN IRAQ,

  GABBARD: I KNEW VERY QUICKLY  
  THAT THERE WAS NO WAY THAT I  

68
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:58,844
  COULD STAY BACK IN

    COMMANDER AND I TOLD HIM.   

73
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:08,987
   I HAVE TO GO WITH YOU GUYS.  

74
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:11,189

     NO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO.     

75
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:14,126

   CONVERSATIONS FOR ME TO GET  

76
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,896
   HIM TO UNDERSTAND THAT I     
   WAS NOT GOING TO STAY HOME.

 FRAGILE LIFE IS AND THAT OUR   
 TIME COULD COME AT ANY MOMENT,

 HER ABSENCE HAD AFFECTED THEM.

    GABBARD: WHEN I CAME HOME   
    FROM MY FIRST DEPLOYMENT.   

104
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:49,287
      WE PROBABLY LANDED AT     
     3 OR 4 IN THE MORNING.     

105
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:55,093

00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:24,422
  I WAS SO FOCUSED IN MY WORLD  
  AND WHAT I WAS DOING I DIDN'T 

113
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:28,660
    FULLY REALIZE UNTIL THAT    
    MOMENT HOW ANXIOUS AND      

114
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:31,062
       STRESSED AND             
       WORRIED THEY WERE.

118
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:44,209
  AS I DUG INTO THEIR ROOTS, I  
  FOUND THAT THEIR FAMILY TREES 

119
00:05:44,278 --> 00:05:47,145
     WERE FILLED WITH PEOPLE    
     WHO SHARED THAT TRAIT.     

120
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:51,750

     LARGELY BEEN FORGOTTEN.    

121

  IT WAS TIME TO UNEARTH THEM.  

122
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:58,056
    I STARTED WITH PAUL RYAN.   

123
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:01,660
    AS HIS NAME SUGGESTS, HIS   
    FATHER'S FAMILY IS IRISH,   

124
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:05,997
     AND PAUL IS WELL-VERSED    
     IN THEIR EXPERIENCE.       

125
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,167
      HE'S EVEN VISITED THE     
     TOWNS IN IRELAND WHERE     

126
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:11,803
      THE RYANS ONCE LIVED.     

127
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:16,608
  HIS MOTHER'S ROOTS, HOWEVER,  
  ARE A DIFFERENT MATTER.       

128
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:19,811
   HE KNOWS THAT SOME OF        
   HER ANCESTORS WERE GERMAN,   

129
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,780
        BUT LITTLE MORE.        

130
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:24,382
      SO WE BEGAN WITH HIS      
      MATERNAL GRANDFATHER,     

131
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:28,486
  WHOM PAUL LOVED, AND WHOSE    
  NAME WAS PARTICULARLY GERMAN. 

132
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:32,357
    THAT'S DR. ADOLPH HUTTER.   

133
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:33,992
   RYAN: MHMM. CAN YOU IMAGINE  
   HIS NAME WAS ADOLPH HUTTER?  

134
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,360
         GATES: I KNOW.         
         WOW. THAT'S...         

135
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:36,795
     RYAN: HE WAS IN THE US     
      NAVY IN WORLD WAR II.     

136
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:37,929
      GATES: THAT'S TOUGH.      

137
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:39,097
           RYAN: YEAH.          

138
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,498
    GATES: AND YOU'VE WRITTEN   
    THAT GROWING UP YOUR        

139
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,434
   GREATEST ASPIRATION WAS TO   
   BE LIKE DR. ADOLPH HUTTER.   

140
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:43,501
           RYAN: YEAH.          

141
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,703
   GATES: TELL ME ABOUT THAT.   

142
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,104
     RYAN: I ADORED THE MAN.    

143
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:49,474
    UGH, HE, HE, LIKE MY MOM,   
    HE WAS A REALLY CHIPPER,    

144
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:53,778
      HAPPY, FUNNY GUY,         
      VERY SMART, UM, WARM.     

145
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:55,714
      PEOPLE LIKED              
      BEING AROUND HIM, UM,     

146
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,849
       I JUST ADORED HIM.       

147
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:02,287
      GATES: PAUL HAD BEEN      
      TOLD BY HIS RELATIVES     

148
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:05,423
    THAT THE HUTTER FAMILY      
    ORIGINALLY IMMIGRATED TO    

149
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:08,026
        THE UNITED STATES       
        FROM BAVARIA.           

150
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:11,062
      BUT HE DIDN'T             
      KNOW WHEN THEY CAME,      

151
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:14,065
  OR ANYTHING AT ALL ABOUT      
  THE DETAILS OF THEIR JOURNEY. 

152
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:18,470
     WE FOUND THE               
     ANSWERS IN A PAMPHLET,     

153
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:21,706
   WRITTEN BUT NEVER PUBLISHED  
   BY ADOLPH'S GRANDFATHER,     

154
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:24,909
   A MAN NAMED JOSEPH HUTTER.   

155
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:31,616
   RYAN: "I WAS BORN JUNE 17,   
   1848 IN GERMANY AND IN 1854  

156
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:33,384
       WE CAME TO AMERICA.      

157
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,919
       I HAD NO IDEA THEY       
       CAME THAT EARLY.         

158
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:38,223
   IN 1854, WE CAME TO AMERICA  
   STOPPING AT HAVERSTRAW,      

159
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,892
   NEW YORK STATE UNTIL 1855."  

160
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,494
     GATES: HAVERSTRAW IS       
     ABOUT 40 MILES NORTH OF    

161
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:43,828
   NEW YORK CITY, BY THE WAY.   

162
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:45,263
       RYAN: OH OKAY.           
       NEVER HEARD OF IT.       

163
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:46,931
       "WE TRAVELED BY          
       RAIL TO MILWAUKEE.       

164
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,433
    WE WERE PENNILESS, AND      
    IN ORDER TO CONTINUE OUR    

165
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:51,336
   TRAVEL TO MADISON BY RAIL,   
   WE HAD TO PLEDGE ALL OF      

166
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:54,606
   OUR PERSONAL BELONGINGS,     
   SUCH AS BEDDING, ETCETERA,   

167
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:57,876
   FOR WHICH WE RECEIVED $12,   

168
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:00,812
       AND THIS TOOK US TO      
    MADISON, WISCONSIN."        

169
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:05,550
  THAT'S AN IMMIGRANT           
  STORY IF THERE EVER WAS ONE.  

170
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:10,021
   MAN, THAT'S A GREAT STORY.   
   I LOVE THAT STORY.           

171
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:19,063
    GATES: HAPPILY FOR PAUL,    
    HIS ANCESTOR'S STORY WAS    

172
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:21,766
    ABOUT TO GET EVEN BETTER.   

173
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,103
  ACCORDING TO JOSEPH, THE      
  HUTTERS CAME TO WISCONSIN TO  

174
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:28,339
  SETTLE IN SAUK COUNTY, WHERE  
  THERE WAS A GROWING COMMUNITY 

175
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:30,541
      OF GERMAN IMMIGRANTS.     

176
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,044
      BUT BY THE TIME           
      THEY REACHED MADISON,     

177
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:35,346
      THEY WERE                 
      PENNILESS ONCE AGAIN,     

178
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:39,517
       AND SAUK COUNTY WAS      
    OVER 50 MILES AWAY!         

179
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,055
    THEY HAD NOTHING LEFT TO    
     SELL, SO THEY CONTINUED    

180
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:47,091
     THEIR JOURNEY, ON FOOT.    

181
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:51,896
     JOSEPH WAS ONLY SIX        
     YEARS OLD AT THE TIME.     

182
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,599
   RYAN: THEY WALKED 50 MILES.  

183
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:57,302
      GATES: YEAH 50 MILES.     
      THEY HAD NO MONEY.        

184
00:08:58,305 --> 00:08:59,704
        CAN YOU IMAGINE?        

185
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:01,172
            RYAN: NO.           

186
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:03,241
  GATES: AND IF WE DO THE MATH, 
  JOSEPH'S MOTHER WAS LIKELY    

187
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,644
 PREGNANT WHEN THE FAMILY       
 IMMIGRATED AND WHEN THE FAMILY 

188
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,881
    WAS MAKING THAT 50          
    MILE WALK TO SAUK COUNTY.   

189
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,950
      CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT?     
      TALK ABOUT TOUGH.         

190
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:14,085
    RYAN: WOW, WOW.             
    PREGNANT WALKING 50 MILES   

191
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:16,087
       TO PLAIN, WISCONSIN      
       FROM MADISON.            

192
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:19,123
  IT'S A PRETTY HILLY AREA TOO. 
  I KNOW THAT SPOT. WOW.        

193
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,661

     TURNED TO THE ARCHIVES,    

194
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,764
   TO COMPARE JOSEPH'S ACCOUNT  
   WITH THE HISTORICAL RECORD.  

195
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:32,370
  THE 1860 CENSUS SHOWED JOSEPH 
  AS AN 11-YEAR-OLD BOY LIVING  

196

  RYAN: DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT.  

200
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,216
  DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THEIR NAMES.

   PEOPLE DO TO MAKE A BETTER   

241
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:18,709
   LIFE FOR THEMSELVES AND HOW  
   HARD IT WAS TO GET GOING IN  

242
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,545
       THIS COUNTY, TO          
       GET THINGS STARTED.      

243
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,079
      GATES: YEAH AND THEY      
      RISKED EVERYTHING.        

244
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:23,681
  RYAN: EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING. 

245
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,916
      GATES: AND THEY WERE      
      JUST GLAD TO BE HERE.     

246
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,250
   RYAN: THEY WALKED 50 MILES.  

247
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:27,585
     GATES: AND THEY            
     WALKED 50 MILES, YEAH.     

248
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:29,053
   RYAN: WHAT ARE THEY DOING,   
   HOW DID THEY DO THAT?        

249
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:30,254
        YEAH. IT'S NEAT.        

250
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:31,489
     GATES: IT'S INCREDIBLE.

    RYAN: YEAH IT               
    REALLY IS, IT REALLY IS.    

252
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:39,196
      GATES: UNLIKE PAUL,       
      MARCO RUBIO KNOWS THE     

253
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,732
 IMMIGRANTS IN HIS FAMILY TREE. 

254
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:44,368
    THEY'RE HIS PARENTS, WHO    
    CAME TO THE UNITED STATES   

255
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:47,538
       FROM CUBA IN 1956.       

256
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:52,310
 BUT MARCO'S DEEPER ROOTS       
 WERE LARGELY A MYSTERY TO HIM. 

257
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,747
  AND AS WE BEGAN OUR RESEARCH, 
  WE SOON UNDERSTOOD WHY.       

258
00:11:58,618 --> 00:12:03,120
 HIS FATHER, MARIO RUBIO REINA, 
 LOST BOTH OF HIS PARENTS BY    

259
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:07,291
   THE TIME HE WAS A TEENAGER,  
   AND ENDED UP LIVING ON THE   

260
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,560
       STREETS OF HAVANA.       

261
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:12,630
      A TRAUMA SO DEEP, IT      
      WAS RARELY DISCUSSED.     

262
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:17,168
  RUBIO: I KNOW VERY            
  LITTLE ABOUT HIS UPBRINGING.  

263
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,737
    I KNOW HIS MOTHER DIED      
    WHEN HE WAS VERY YOUNG OF   

264
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:21,906
       TUBERCULOSIS OR          
       SOME LUNG DISEASE.       

265
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:24,675
     AND THEN UH, HIS FATHER    
    AT SOME POINT REMARRIED,    

266
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,545
        AND UM, AND THEN,       

267
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:28,746
        WHEN HE WAS STILL       
        VERY YOUNG,             

268
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:30,147
   CERTAINLY BEFORE HE WAS 18,  

269
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:31,615
      HE MOVED OUT WITH ONE     
      OF HIS BROTHERS AND       

270
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,084
      LIVED SOMEWHERE ELSE.     

271
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:35,720
   YOU KNOW, THIS IS A GUY 14,  
   15 YEARS OF AGE ON HIS OWN.  

272
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:40,057
    GATES: AS IT TURNS OUT,     
    MARCO'S FATHER WASN'T THE   

273
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:43,260
    ONLY ONE IN HIS FAMILY TO   
    SUFFER SUCH LOSSES.         

274
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,231
  WE DISCOVERED THAT BOTH OF    
  MARIO'S PARENTS WERE ORPHANED 

275
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:51,535
  AT AN EARLY AGE, MEANING THAT 
  AT LEAST TWO GENERATIONS OF   

276
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:56,040
  MARCO'S ANCESTORS HAD TO FEND 
  FOR THEMSELVES AS CHILDREN.   

277
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:59,877
 RUBIO: YOU CAN BEGIN TO SEE    
 WHY SOME OF THESE STORIES WERE 

278
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:03,314
    NOT TOLD, ESPECIALLY THEY   
    DIDN'T HAVE, IF THEIR,      

279
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:04,682
     IF THESE KIDS WERE VERY    
    YOUNG WHEN THEIR PARENTS    

280
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:06,650
    DIED THEY JUST PROBABLY     
    DIDN'T KNOW AS MUCH ABOUT   

281
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:08,586
     THEIR PARENTS AND          
     COULDN'T PASS IT DOWN.     

282
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:10,888
      AND IT CERTAINLY          
      EXPLAINS A LOT ABOUT,     

283
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,324
        MY, MY FATHER           
        CERTAINLY WASN'T,       

284
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:15,960
  I DON'T THINK HE WAS ASHAMED  
  OF HIS FAMILY'S HISTORY,      

285
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:17,595
       HE JUST WASN'T A         
       PROMINENT FEATURE.       

286
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:19,497
       YOU WOULD THINK HE       
       KIND OF, YOU KNOW,       

287
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,365
 JUST APPEARED ON THE EARTH ONE 
 DAY AND THERE WAS NOTHING THAT 

288
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:23,501
    CAME BEFORE IT OTHER        
    THAN VERY VAGUE NOTIONS.    

289
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:25,136
     GATES: AND WHO WANTS TO    
     REVISIT ALL THAT PAIN?     

290
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:26,704
    RUBIO: YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.    

291
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:28,506
       GATES: THAT'S SAD.       

292
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,508
          RUBIO: IT IS.         

293
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:35,212
 GATES: I WANTED TO RECOVER THE 
 STORIES THAT MARCO'S FAMILY    

294
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:38,649
        HAD LOST AMIDST         
        ALL THIS TRAGEDY.       

295
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:42,620
     ONE STOOD OUT AS           
     ESPECIALLY MEANINGFUL.     

296
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:45,823
    IT CONCERNS HIS             
    THIRD GREAT-GRANDFATHER,    

297
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:49,093

     1760 IN SEVILLE, SPAIN.    

299
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:57,635
       JOSE'S BIRTHPLACE        
       WAS NOT UNEXPECTED,      

300
00:13:57,703 --> 00:14:00,304
       AS MANY CUBANS HAVE      
       SPANISH ANCESTRY,        

301
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:03,808
     BUT HIS OCCUPATION TOOK    
     BOTH OF US BY SURPRISE.    

302
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:08,412
      RECORDS SHOW THAT HE      
      RECEIVED A LAW DEGREE

    THAT'S UNREAL.              
     THAT'S REALLY AMAZING.     

311

      A PUBLIC PROSECUTOR.

  WELL, IT'S THE FIRST TIME I

  WITH GOVERNMENT UP UNTIL ME.

  HEIGHTS THAT HIS DESCENDENT   

324
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:58,662
   MARCO HAS REACHED, BUT HIS   
   CAREER IN GOVERNMENT WAS     

325
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,865
   MARKED BY ONE                
   INCREDIBLE ACCOMPLISHMENT.

00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:22,112
    SURVEYING THEIR LIVES,      
    MARCO WONDERED HOW THESE    

358
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,782
       ANCESTORS MAY HAVE       
       INFLUENCED HIM,          

359
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,684
     EVEN THOUGH THEIR          
     STORIES HAD BEEN LOST.     

360
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:30,988
  RUBIO: THOSE CAMPAIGNS        
  THAT I RAN MY DAD LOVED THEM, 

361
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:33,624
 I MEAN HE LOVED BEING INVOLVED 
 IN IT AND LOVED DOING IT.      

362
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,759
       I CAN'T IMAGINE HE       
        KNEW ANY OF THIS,       

363
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,661
      LIKE NO ONE'S EVER        
      TOLD US ANY OF THIS.      

364
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,463
    SO IT JUST KINDA            
    TELLS YOU THAT SOMEWHERE,   

365
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:41,398
  YOU KNOW, IN, IN THEIR BLOOD  
  BACK THEN IT WAS SOMEONE WHO  

366
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:44,134
  CARED ABOUT AND WAS INVOLVED  
  IN GOVERNMENT SERVICE AND,    

367
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:46,070
    AND THEN THERE WAS THESE    
    THINGS THAT MADE IT         

368
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:48,205
      IMPOSSIBLE FOR THREE      
      GENERATIONS TO DO IT,     

369
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:50,007
    AND THEN SUDDENLY YOU       
    PUT SOMEONE IN THE RIGHT    

370
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:52,176
      ENVIRONMENT AND THEY      
      WIND UP, YOU KNOW,        

371
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:53,777
        IN THE US SENATE.       

372
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,179
    THAT'S JUST UNBELIEVABLE.   

373
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:58,315
            GOD. WOW.

377
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:10,327

    WITH THE U.S. NAVY.         

381
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:26,777

  REASON THAT HE WAS IN SAMOA,

  IN FACT, A PHOTO OF HIS HOUSE 
  RIGHT BEFORE IT WAS DESTROYED

       CHANGED EVERYTHING.      

499

     THAT'S REALLY SPECIAL.     

518
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:10,180
   GATES: WE HAD ALREADY        
   TAKEN PAUL RYAN BACK TO HIS  

519
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:12,682
    GREAT-GREAT-GRANDFATHER,    
    JOSEPH HUTTER,              

520
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:14,584
       A GERMAN IMMIGRANT       
       WHO FOUNDED A            

521
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:17,320
      CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS     
      IN WISCONSIN.             

522
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,857
  NOW, WE WANTED TO GO FURTHER  
  ON THIS LINE, TO SEE WHERE    

523
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:24,360
       EXACTLY THE HUTTER       
       FAMILY ORIGINATED,       

524
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:28,031
 AND TRY TO LEARN WHY THEY      
 MADE THEIR JOURNEY TO AMERICA. 

525
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,669
    THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT    
    HAVE LONG ANIMATED PAUL.    

526
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:35,572
   AS, GROWING UP, HIS          
   GERMAN ROOTS WERE NEVER AS   

527
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,541
       MUCH-DISCUSSED AS        
       HIS IRISH HERITAGE.      

528
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:41,344
     RYAN: I ALWAYS WONDERED    
     WHY THEY IMMIGRATED.       

529
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:42,412
         I DIDN'T KNOW.         

530
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,680
        BECAUSE I KNOW          
        THE FAMINE IRISH.       

531
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:44,948
     I KNOW THE IRISH STORY.    

532
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:46,182
     THAT'S A PRETTY            
     SIMPLE STORY, YOU KNOW.    

533
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:47,450
       GATES: YEAH, SURE.       

534
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,719
    RYAN: BUT I NEVER REALLY    
    KNEW THE BAVARIAN STORY,    

535
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,421
      BUT I DON'T KNOW IF       
      YOU KNOW THAT OR NOT.     

536
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:52,789
     YOU'RE GONNA GET THERE.    

537
00:24:52,857 --> 00:24:53,890
      GATES: WAIT AND SEE.      

538
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:55,925
      RYAN: I HAVE NO CLUE.     
      I DON'T WHY.              

539
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:58,728
  GATES: TRACING PAUL'S FAMILY  
  IN GERMANY WOULD PROVE TO     

540
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:01,397
     BE A SUBSTANTIAL TASK.     

541
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,868
  WE KNEW THAT JOSEPH HUTTER    
ARRIVED IN NEW YORK IN 1854,    

542
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:09,505
    BUT HIS ARRIVAL RECORD      
    DIDN'T NAME HIS HOMETOWN.   

543
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:14,010
  SO ALL WE HAD TO GO ON WAS A  
  FAMILY STORY THAT THE HUTTERS 

544
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:16,612
  ORIGINALLY CAME FROM BAVARIA. 

545
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:22,352
 FORTUNATELY, BAVARIAN CHURCHES 
 KEEP VERY GOOD RECORDS.

556
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:49,012
  YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.  

557
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,381
  GATES: AND JOHANNES OF        
  COURSE BECAME KNOWN AS JOHN.  

558
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:54,150
      RYAN: YEAH. MY GOSH.      

559
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:57,787
   GATES: WE NOW KNEW THAT      
   PAUL'S ANCESTORS CAME FROM   

560
00:25:57,856 --> 00:26:01,290
  HOCHABRUNN, A VILLAGE ON      
  THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE TOWN OF  

561

 WALDMUCHEN IN EASTERN BAVARIA. 

562
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:07,697
 AND THIS ALLOWED US TO PROVIDE 
 SOME CONTEXT TO HIS FAMILY'S   

563
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:09,799
      DECISION TO EMIGRATE.

    HUTTERS LEFT, IN 1854,      

565
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:17,173
  MOST OF HOCHABRUNN'S          
  POPULATION WERE TRADESPEOPLE  

566
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,910

   SIMPLY TO FEED THEMSELVES.   

568
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:27,917
    THEY LEFT LITTLE EVIDENCE   
    OF THEIR LIVES BEHIND,      

569
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:31,020
   BUT PAUL WAS THRILLED TO

       IN THE CONFEDERACY.      

711
00:32:35,352 --> 00:32:38,954
    AND THE TWO FORCES SOON     
    FACED OFF AT A SMALL TOWN   

712
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:42,591
       IN NORTHERN GEORGIA      
       KNOWN AS RESACA.         

713
00:32:44,428 --> 00:32:47,129
     FOR TWO DAYS, THE UNION    
     STRUGGLED TO DRIVE THE     

714
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:50,699
  CONFEDERATES FROM THE FIELD,  
  FIGHTING ON TERRAIN THAT WAS  

715
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:53,769
    ILL-SUITED FOR AN ATTACK.   

716
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:56,705
      LEWIS'S REGIMENT WAS      
       ON THE FRONT LINES.      

717
00:32:57,875 --> 00:32:59,775
  WE FOUND A NEWSPAPER ARTICLE,

       WRITTEN JUST WEEKS       
        AFTER THE BATTLE,       

719
00:33:02,346 --> 00:33:05,080

   CHARGE THE REBELS IN FRONT,  

722
00:33:10,654 --> 00:33:12,554
     WERE COMPELLED TO WADE     

723
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:16,325
  A CREEK WAIST DEEP, WHICH     
  RAN AT THE FOOT OF THE BLUFF; 

724
00:33:16,393 --> 00:33:19,294
   AND THEN ACROSS A            
   VALLEY FILLED WITH DITCHES,  

725

727
00:33:26,036 --> 00:33:29,204

    THEY COULD NOT ACCOMPLISH   

728
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:31,907
      IMPOSSIBILITIES, AND,     
      AFTER SEVERE LOSS,        

729
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:34,576

00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,846
      GABBARD: IT'S TOUGH.      

732
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:40,449
 GATES: NOW, WE DON'T KNOW      
 EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO LEWIS 

733
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,652
   IN THAT BATTLE, BUT HIS      
   REGIMENT WAS ASSAULTING THE  

734
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:46,154
    VERY SAME CENTER STRETCH    
     OF THE CONFEDERATE LINE    

735

   DESCRIBED IN THAT ARTICLE.   

736
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:50,626
   HE AND HIS COMRADES LIKELY   
   DESCENDED A STEEP RIDGE,     

737
00:33:50,694 --> 00:33:53,862
  AND THEN CROSSED A CREEK      
  AND SCALED AN ALMOST VERTICAL 

738
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:56,331
  SLOPE WHERE THE CONFEDERATES  
  HAD DUG EARTHWORKS,           

739
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,167

743
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:05,974
       HE WAS ON THE LINE.      

744

   EXISTS ON YOUR FAMILY TREE?  

747
00:34:11,815 --> 00:34:13,515

748
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:17,019
    IT SAYS A LOT ABOUT THIS    
    ETHIC OF SERVICE...

750

    GABBARD: GOING BACK MUCH    
    FARTHER THAN I KNEW.

752
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:28,397
      BUT SOON FACED AN         
      EVEN GREATER ORDEAL.      

753
00:34:28,899 --> 00:34:31,800
       JUST DAYS AFTER THE      
      BATTLE, HE TOOK ILL,      

754
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:34,503
        AND WAS SENT TO A       
        FIELD HOSPITAL.         

755
00:34:35,439 --> 00:34:37,940
    HE NEVER FULLY RECOVERED.   

756
00:34:38,008 --> 00:34:41,076
    OVER THE NEXT SIX MONTHS,   
    LOUIS WAS TREATED IN FOUR   

757

 FROM STOMACH AILMENTS THAT     

758
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:48,583

   DECADES FOLLOWING THE WAR.   

759
00:34:50,387 --> 00:34:53,322

  ABOUT THE DOLLARS AND CENTS,

 EXCITING TO HEAR AND IN MY OWN 

795
00:36:49,339 --> 00:36:53,175
  VERY SMALL WAY BE ABLE TO

810
00:37:31,214 --> 00:37:33,815

811
00:37:34,918 --> 00:37:36,952
      WE STARTED WITH

812
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:41,189
  PEDRO GARCIA, A MAN WHOSE     
  LIFE WAS MARKED BY HARDSHIP.  

813

    RUBIO: MY GRANDFATHER HAD   
    AN UP OR DOWN EXISTENCE.

  YOU KNOW, HE AT ONE POINT HAD 
  A PRETTY GOOD JOB WORKING IN

00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:50,999
   A, FOR THE RAILROAD COMPANY  
   OR WHATEVER IT WAS AND       

816
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:53,702
     THEN HE LOST THAT JOB,     
     AND THEN HE STRUGGLED.     

817
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:56,671
   HE HAD BEEN UH, HANDICAPPED  
   AS A BOY WITH POLIO.         

818
00:37:57,207 --> 00:37:58,940
  AND THERE WERE TIMES WHERE HE 
  REALLY STRUGGLED TO PROVIDE   

819
00:37:59,009 --> 00:38:01,176
     FOR THEM BECAUSE           
     PHYSICALLY HE COULDN'T,    

820
00:38:01,244 --> 00:38:03,678
  YOU KNOW, DO SOME OF THE WORK 
  THAT OTHER PEOPLE COULD DO.   

821
00:38:05,682 --> 00:38:09,284
GATES: PEDRO IMMIGRATED TO      
AMERICA FROM CUBA IN THE 1950S. 

822
00:38:10,487 --> 00:38:12,620
     MARCO KNEW HIM, AND        
     REMEMBERS HIM FONDLY AS    

823
00:38:12,689 --> 00:38:15,890
     A MAN WHO LOVED HISTORY    
    AND LOVED STORY-TELLING.    

824
00:38:17,494 --> 00:38:19,894
     BUT PEDRO RARELY SPOKE     
     ABOUT HIS CHILDHOOD,       

825
00:38:19,963 --> 00:38:23,365
     AND MARCO KNOWS NEXT TO    
    NOTHING ABOUT HIS ROOTS.    

826

    ONE OF A LOT OF KIDS AND,   

827
00:38:27,437 --> 00:38:29,571
     AND YOU KNOW, THE STORY    
     ALWAYS WAS HIS PARENTS,    

828
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:31,039
       I'M NOT SURE

   LIMITS OF MARCO'S KNOWLEDGE  

841
00:38:49,826 --> 00:38:51,726
       REQUIRED SOME LUCK.      

842
00:38:51,795 --> 00:38:54,095
   WE WERE ABLE TO LEARN VERY   
   LITTLE ABOUT PEDRO'S FATHER  

843
00:38:54,164 --> 00:38:57,232
  CARLOS, AND WE COULD ONLY     
  TRACE HIS MOTHER RAMONA BACK

  ONE GENERATION, TO THE 1850S.

     WE WERE ABLE TO GO MUCH    
     FURTHER BACK IN TIME.      

848
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:12,714
     MANY OF HER ANCESTORS      
     LIVED IN PINAR DEL RÍO,

    PROVINCE IN WESTERN CUBA,   

850
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:20,155

     TAKING HER ROOTS

  MEANING MARCO RUBIO'S FAMILY  
  HAS LIVED IN CUBA FOR MUCH    

853
00:39:29,666 --> 00:39:32,867
  LONGER THAN HE EVER DREAMED.

       NORTHERN EUROPE WHO      

866

  SEE THAT HIS MATERNAL ROOTS   

874
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:13,341
     RAN SO DEEPLY IN CUBA,     
      HE'D EXPECTED THEM TO

       TRACE IN THE NEAR

       HIS FATHER'S SIDE.       

877
00:40:19,549 --> 00:40:22,016
 BUT HE WAS EVEN MORE SURPRISED 
 BY WHAT RECORDS REVEALED ABOUT 

878
00:40:22,085 --> 00:40:26,020
 HIS THIRD GREAT-GRANDFATHER, A 
  MAN NAMED JUAN JOSÉ CHIROLES. 

879
00:40:27,424 --> 00:40:30,024
    HE WAS A LANDOWNER.         
    HE OWNED A TOBACCO FARM.    

880
00:40:30,093 --> 00:40:31,492
       DID YOU KNOW THAT?       

881
00:40:31,561 --> 00:40:33,561
        RUBIO: I DID NOT.       
        I HAD NO CLUE.          

882
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,430
  IT'S THE FIRST TIME EVER THAT 
  SOMEONE SAYS THAT ANYBODY IN

    MY LINEAGE OWNED ANYTHING   
    IN CUBA BEYOND THE

885
00:40:41,104 --> 00:40:45,073
 GATES: AS IT TURNS OUT, JUAN   
 OWNED ROUGHLY 30 ACRES OF LAND 

886
00:40:45,141 --> 00:40:48,710
     ON WHICH HE GREW           
     TOBACCO, CORN AND RICE,    

887
00:40:49,379 --> 00:40:52,013
  BUT THAT WASN'T ALL HE OWNED. 

888
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:55,850
  WE FOUND THE BAPTISMAL RECORD

       FOLLOW-UP QUESTION,      

898
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:20,975

      THEY OWNED ANY LAND,      

903
00:41:26,816 --> 00:41:28,449

 I MEAN IF YOU BAPTIZED THEM    
 IT'S BECAUSE YOU BELIEVED THEY 

907
00:41:34,324 --> 00:41:36,391
     HAD A SOUL AND WERE        
     CREATED IN GOD'S IMAGE.    

908
00:41:36,459 --> 00:41:38,559
       HOW THEN COULD           
       YOU OWN THEM AS A,

        NATIVE AMERICAN.        

947
00:43:25,268 --> 00:43:27,435
    ONE OF YOUR GREAT-GREAT-    
    GREAT-GRANDMOTHERS          

948
00:43:27,503 --> 00:43:29,403
   WAS A PURE NATIVE AMERICAN.  

949
00:43:29,472 --> 00:43:31,205
        RUBIO: YEAH, WOW,       
        LOOK AT THAT.           

950
00:43:31,274 --> 00:43:33,074
 GATES: SCHOLARS BELIEVE THAT   
 THE NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATION 

951
00:43:33,142 --> 00:43:36,477
    IN PINAR DEL RÍO MIGRATED   
   FROM THE YUCATÁN PENINSULA   

952
00:43:36,546 --> 00:43:39,180
         ABOUT 4000 BC.

        ABOUT, YOU KNOW,        

955
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:44,285
  ANCESTRAL ROOTS IN CUBA, YOUR 
 FAMILY ON YOUR NATIVE AMERICAN 

956
00:43:44,354 --> 00:43:46,554

     FOR A LONG, LONG TIME.     

957
00:43:46,623 --> 00:43:48,522

   THOSE RUINS IN THE YUCATÁN.  

958
00:43:48,591 --> 00:43:49,757
         GATES: OH YEAH?        

959
00:43:49,826 --> 00:43:51,592
     RUBIO: AT CHICHEN ITZA,    
     AND WHO KNEW I WAS         

960
00:43:51,661 --> 00:43:53,761
        GOING BACK HOME?        

961
00:43:55,465 --> 00:43:59,600
 GATES: MARCO'S DNA UNDERSCORES 
 A LARGER POINT: ALMOST EVERY   

962
00:43:59,669 --> 00:44:03,070
     AMERICAN DESCENDS FROM     
     SOMEONE WHO WASN'T BORN    

963
00:44:03,139 --> 00:44:06,674
     IN OUR COUNTRY, BUT HAS    
     EMBRACED, AND ENRICHED     

964
00:44:06,743 --> 00:44:08,809
        IT JUST THE SAME.       

965
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:13,948
  WE'D SEEN THIS OVER AND OVER  
   IN MY GUESTS' FAMILY TREES,  

966
00:44:14,017 --> 00:44:17,051
    AND ITS RELEVANCE WASN'T    
    LOST ON ANY OF THEM,        

967
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,121
  LEAST OF ALL ON MARCO RUBIO.  

968
00:44:21,457 --> 00:44:24,525
    RUBIO: THIS REALLY BRINGS   
   IT TO LIGHT ABOUT AMERICA.   

969
00:44:25,428 --> 00:44:27,328
    IN AMERICA WE DON'T         
    HAVE A COMMON ETHNICITY,    

970
00:44:27,397 --> 00:44:28,763
       A COMMON LANGUAGE.       

971
00:44:28,831 --> 00:44:30,498
  I MEAN THERE'S, THERE ARE     
  COUNTRIES IN THIS WORLD THAT  

972
00:44:30,566 --> 00:44:33,200
     DOING THE DNA OF THE       
     POPULATION WOULD NOT BE    

973
00:44:33,269 --> 00:44:36,237
  VERY COMPLICATED, EVERYONE AT 
  SOME POINT IS PRETTY SIMILAR. 

974
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:37,471
      GATES: LIKE ICELAND.      

975
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:39,674
    RUBIO: LIKE, YEAH, RIGHT.   
    SO, I, AND OTHER PLACES.    

976
00:44:39,742 --> 00:44:42,843
  AND, BUT IN AMERICA WE'RE,    
  IT'S NOT JUST A GENETIC MIX.  

977
00:44:42,912 --> 00:44:44,845
    WE COME FROM DIFFERENT      
    CONTINENTS AND DIFFERENT    

978
00:44:44,914 --> 00:44:46,047
       PARTS OF THE WORLD.      

979
00:44:46,115 --> 00:44:47,882
    IF YOU GO FAR ENOUGH,       
    WE COME FROM EVERYWHERE.    

980
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:49,850
  BUT I'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT THE 
  ONE THING WE HAVE IN COMMON   

981
00:44:49,919 --> 00:44:51,686
      IN ALL OF OUR DNA AS      
       AMERICANS IS WE ALL      

982
00:44:51,754 --> 00:44:53,521
    DESCEND FROM GO-GETTERS.    

983
00:44:53,589 --> 00:44:55,289
     EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US     
     DESCENDS FROM SOMEONE      

984
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:58,726
   WHO OVERCAME INCREDIBLE      
   ADVERSITY, WHETHER IT WAS    

985
00:44:58,795 --> 00:45:01,495
      UH, THE JOURNEY THAT      
      BROUGHT THEM INTO,        

986
00:45:01,564 --> 00:45:04,432
 INTO SLAVERY AND THEN SURVIVED 
 IT IN BRUTAL CONDITIONS FOR    

987
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,134
   HUNDREDS OF YEARS, WHETHER   
   IT'S SOMEONE WHO CAME LAST   

988
00:45:07,203 --> 00:45:09,670
  WEEK FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY     
  IN SEARCH OF A BETTER LIFE,   

989
00:45:09,739 --> 00:45:11,605
      OR SOMEONE WHO CAME       
      200 YEARS AGO IN          

990
00:45:11,674 --> 00:45:13,374
    SEARCH OF A BETTER LIFE.    

991
00:45:13,443 --> 00:45:16,143
  OUR COMMON DNA IN AMERICA IS  
  WE ALMOST ALL DESCEND FROM A  

992
00:45:16,212 --> 00:45:19,647
 GO-GETTER, SOMEONE WHO REFUSED 
  TO ACCEPT THE LIMITS PUT UPON 

993
00:45:19,716 --> 00:45:22,316
  THEM IN THE OLD WORLD, AND    
  SO THEY REACHED FOR THIS ONE  

994
00:45:22,385 --> 00:45:25,152
   PLACE WHERE THEY WERE GONNA  
   BE JUDGED BY WHO THEY WERE,  

995
00:45:25,221 --> 00:45:27,188
    NOT WHERE THEY CAME FROM.   

996
00:45:27,256 --> 00:45:29,290
