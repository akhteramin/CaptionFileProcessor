00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:03,966
AND LET'S START WITH APACHE.    
USED TO BE MUCH HIGHER AND EGYPT

1430
00:55:03,968 --> 00:55:05,200
USED TO BE MUCH HIGHER AND EGYPT
AND A GOOD PLACE AND IN THE

MOST IMPORTANTLY, THEY HAVE A   

1434
00:55:07,972 --> 00:55:10,673
MOST IMPORTANTLY, THEY HAVE A   
TON OF EXPOSURE TO THE PERMIAN  

1435
00:55:10,675 --> 00:55:12,608
TON OF EXPOSURE TO THE PERMIAN  
BASIN BUT THE COMPANY HAS BEEN  

1436
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:13,609
BASIN BUT THE COMPANY HAS BEEN  
INCONSISTENT PRODUCER.          

1437
00:55:13,611 --> 00:55:15,311
INCONSISTENT PRODUCER.          
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WE LEARNED

1438
00:55:15,313 --> 00:55:18,180
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WE LEARNED
OF A MAJOR NEW DISCOVERY, ALPINE

1439
00:55:18,182 --> 00:55:20,616
OF A MAJOR NEW DISCOVERY, ALPINE
HIGH BUT NOT LIVED UP TO THE

EXPECTATIONS                    

1441
00:55:20,918 --> 00:55:22,051
EXPECTATIONS                    
THE HYPE WAS TERRIBLE.          

1442
00:55:22,053 --> 00:55:23,152
THE HYPE WAS TERRIBLE.          
AND PROBABLY BECAUSE THE        

1443
00:55:23,154 --> 00:55:26,455
AND PROBABLY BECAUSE THE        
PROPERTY TURNED OUT TO BE LESS  

1444
00:55:26,457 --> 00:55:28,590
PROPERTY TURNED OUT TO BE LESS  
OILY AND MORE GASSY AND OIL IS  

1445
00:55:28,592 --> 00:55:29,825
OILY AND MORE GASSY AND OIL IS  
MORE VALUABLE THAN GAS          

1446
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:32,394
MORE VALUABLE THAN GAS          
THERE IS NO MARKET FOR THE DARK 

1447
00:55:32,396 --> 00:55:32,628
THERE IS NO MARKET FOR THE DARK 
STUFF.                          

1448
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:33,729
STUFF.                          
BUT STILL APACHE STOCK HAS COME 

1449
00:55:33,731 --> 00:55:35,664
BUT STILL APACHE STOCK HAS COME 
DOWN TO RIDICULOUSLY LOW LEVELS.

1450
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:37,800
DOWN TO RIDICULOUSLY LOW LEVELS.
THIS IS $101 STOCK FIVE YEARS   

1451
00:55:37,802 --> 00:55:40,703
THIS IS $101 STOCK FIVE YEARS   
AGO AND IT BOTTOMED AT $25 AT   

1452
00:55:40,705 --> 00:55:41,270

00:55:41,272 --> 00:55:43,005
CHRISTMAS.                      
I THINK IT HAS MORE UPSIDE      

1454
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:44,173
I THINK IT HAS MORE UPSIDE      
YOU HAVE TO LIKE NATURAL GAS    

1455
00:55:44,175 --> 00:55:48,177
YOU HAVE TO LIKE NATURAL GAS    
AND THEY DO HAVE A DEBT-LADEN   

1456
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:49,011
AND THEY DO HAVE A DEBT-LADEN   
BALANCE SHEET AND I THINK THIS  

1457
00:55:49,013 --> 00:55:51,113
BALANCE SHEET AND I THINK THIS  
IS THE PRODUCER THAT MIGHT BE   

1458
00:55:51,115 --> 00:55:53,048
IS THE PRODUCER THAT MIGHT BE   
WORTH MORE TO EXXON ON ON ITS   

1459
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:54,883
WORTH MORE TO EXXON ON ON ITS

IT IS TRANSFORMED INTO A NICE   

1462
00:55:58,556 --> 00:56:00,189
IT IS TRANSFORMED INTO A NICE   
EASY TO UNDERSTAND WELL-RUN AND 

1463
00:56:00,191 --> 00:56:03,058
EASY TO UNDERSTAND WELL-RUN AND 
PURE PLAY IN THE PERMIAN BASIN  

1464
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:06,328
PURE PLAY IN THE PERMIAN BASIN  
IF I'M RUNNING OXY DENTAL I

IF I'M RUNNING OXY DENTAL I     
WOULD BE SALIVATED BUT THEY'VE

TERRIFIC POSITION TO COIN MONEY 
AND FOR THE RIGHT PRICE MAYBE

THEY AGREE TO BE ACQUIRED AND

ACROSS TWO OF THE BEST SUB AREAS

1476
00:56:28,686 --> 00:56:30,052
ACROSS TWO OF THE BEST SUB AREAS
OF THE PERMIAN AND I THINK THEY

ARE POISED TO TRANSITION FROM

TAKEOVER TARGET AND STOCK IS    
CHEAP AT 5 FINALSE EARNINGS AND

IT WOULD BE A MAJOR DEAL IF IT

IT WOULD BE A MAJOR DEAL IF IT  
WAS BOUGHT
