It handled old master paintings.

60
00:03:20,384 --> 00:03:22,801
        It handled modern       
        master paintings.       

61
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:28,273
And then from around 1970 or so,
    handled contemporary art.   

62
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:30,425
         And in each one

00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:57,886

   prosecutor Jason Hernandez   

71

     and U.S. investigators

       What drew me to it

99

101
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:22,471
     what her life was like     
           in Mexico,           

102
00:05:22,473 --> 00:05:23,955
   which was her home country.  

103
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:25,557
     We know that she worked    
        in different jobs       

104
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:28,727

107

      as a kitchen helper.      

108
00:05:36,687 --> 00:05:39,321
It takes them little over a year
      to earn enough money      

109
00:05:39,323 --> 00:05:42,074
       to move to the real      
        city of dreams --       

110
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:45,077
            New York.           

111
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:48,730
   In 1986, Rosales is granted  
      permanent residence.      

112
00:05:48,732 --> 00:05:51,666
    She and Jose Bergantiños    
         have a daughter        

113
00:05:51,668 --> 00:05:55,370
      and buy a small house     
         in the suburbs.        

114
00:05:55,372 --> 00:05:58,507
      Rosales even fulfills     
    her childhood aspiration    

115
00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:01,426
        and opens a small       
     gallery business called    

116

       "King's Fine Art."       

117
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:07,382
 Konnikova: What Glafira Rosales
      told people was that      

118
00:06:07,384 --> 00:06:10,218
      she was from a family     
         that loved art,        

119
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:14,639
  that had a lot of people come 
 to their house for art salons. 

120
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:16,358
  And so from a very young age, 

121
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,894
       she was fascinated       
         by this world.         

122
00:06:18,896 --> 00:06:20,946
    Narrator: Sometime later,   
          Rosales meets

00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:24,649
       a well-liked figure      
   in the New York art scene,   

124
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:29,104
 who happens to hold a position 
      at Knoedler Gallery.      

125
00:06:29,106 --> 00:06:30,605
  He offers to set up a meeting 

126
00:06:30,607 --> 00:06:35,494
  with the gallery's director,  
          Ann Freedman.         

127
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:37,129
     Konnikova: Ann Freedman    
         was pretty new         

128
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:38,663
  as the director of Knoedler.  

129
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:40,832
   She'd been very successful   
        in her art career       

130
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:44,970
      and someone who knows     
  how to sell things to people, 

131
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:46,788
     which is what you need     
        in the art world.       

132
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,257
    But now she really wanted   
         to make a mark         

133
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:54,462
    as the female director of   
 this really prominent gallery. 

134
00:06:54,464 --> 00:06:55,964
Narrator: As luck would have it,

135
00:06:55,966 --> 00:07:01,069
       Rosales is looking       
     to make her mark, too.     

136
00:07:01,071 --> 00:07:02,571
           So in 1995,          

137
00:07:02,573 --> 00:07:04,739
        when 40 year-old        
         Glafira Rosales        

138
00:07:04,741 --> 00:07:07,859
 breezes into Knoedler & Company
         with a canvas,         

139
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:10,195
        she's the epitome       
        of a well-dressed       

140
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:13,865
   and cultivated art dealer.   

141
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:16,985
        Lawyer Luke Nikas       
    represented Ann Freedman    

142
00:07:16,987 --> 00:07:20,839
      in what's been called     
 "the art trial of the century."

143
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:23,375
        You have a woman        
        who's unassuming.       

144
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:24,709
        She's not slick.        

145
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:29,497
      She doesn't have this     
       well-planned story.      

146
00:07:29,499 --> 00:07:32,634
    She's got a relationship    
           with a man           

147
00:07:32,636 --> 00:07:35,470
   who inherited the painting   
        from his father,        

148
00:07:35,472 --> 00:07:38,140
     and he lived in Mexico.    

149
00:07:38,142 --> 00:07:41,693
  And he just wanted to get rid 
       of this collection.      

150
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:44,496
    Narrator: Freedman leads    
        Rosales upstairs        

151
00:07:44,498 --> 00:07:47,165
    to a small drawing room.    

152
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:49,701
       The painting's warm      
        peachy background       

153
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:52,037
        with two ethereal       
         clouds of color        

154
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:55,991
   is immediately recognizable  
  as the work of Mark Rothko -- 

155
00:07:55,993 --> 00:08:00,378
     a leading artist of the    
abstract-expressionist movement.

156
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,248
       Rothko, along with       
        Jackson Pollock,        

157
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,834
       Robert Motherwell,       
    and a few select others,    

158
00:08:05,836 --> 00:08:08,470
  were leaders of the abstract- 
     expressionist movement     

159
00:08:08,472 --> 00:08:12,373
    that emerged in New York    
        during the 1940s.       

160
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,559
     That handful of artists    
         are the artists        

161
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:18,680
    that are the most valued,   
  have the largest reputation,  

162
00:08:18,682 --> 00:08:22,984
       and in some cases,       
 also fetch the highest prices. 

163
00:08:22,986 --> 00:08:25,187
     Narrator: People don't     
     walk in off the street     

164
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:26,938
       carrying a Rothko,       

165
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,524
   and Ann Freedman knows it.   

166
00:08:29,526 --> 00:08:31,993
        When questioned,        
     Rosales spins her tale     

167
00:08:31,995 --> 00:08:35,280
  of growing up in a prominent  
   Catholic family in Mexico,   

168
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:39,784
   surrounded by the crème de   
      la crème of society.      

169
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:42,287
      That's where Glafira      
         came in contact        

170
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:45,173
    with the heir to a secret   
        art collection --       

171
00:08:45,175 --> 00:08:49,577
    a man she refers to only    
           as "Mr. X."          

172
00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:50,929
     To begin, she would try    

173
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:53,248
     to sell the collection     
      of a painter friend,      

174
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:57,135
  someone whose confidentiality 
      she wanted to respect     

175
00:08:57,137 --> 00:09:01,890
     and so he became known     
            as Mr. X.           

176
00:09:01,892 --> 00:09:04,709
    Narrator: Mr. X's father    
        had been a patron       

177
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,929
  of the abstract expressionist 
           art scene.           

178
00:09:07,931 --> 00:09:11,449
 He purchased artworks straight 
   from the artist's studios,   

179
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:13,101
         paying in cash,        

180
00:09:13,103 --> 00:09:16,871
     so the assets and taxes    
      were never declared.      

181
00:09:16,873 --> 00:09:18,106
      According to Rosales,     

182
00:09:18,108 --> 00:09:22,994
  there's another family secret 
    that needs to be kept...    

183
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:25,163
       Flam: This man was       
    married and had a family    

184
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:28,783
 and he was a closet homosexual,
   and in Mexico, supposedly,   

185
00:09:28,785 --> 00:09:31,586
     it was dangerous to be     
   a homosexual at that time.   

186
00:09:31,588 --> 00:09:33,121
     And so the man had died    

187
00:09:33,123 --> 00:09:35,957
   and now his son was selling  
          the pictures,         

188
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:39,060
     but he wanted to do it     
   as discreetly as possible.   

189
00:09:39,062 --> 00:09:42,430
 Narrator: But there's a bonus, 
       and it's alluring.       

190
00:09:42,432 --> 00:09:46,318
   This Rothko is just the tip  
         of the iceberg.        

191
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,153
      Her secretive client      
        has a collection        

192
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:52,607
   of previously unknown works  
      by Robert Motherwell,     

193
00:09:52,609 --> 00:09:58,146
       Willem de Kooning,       
   Jackson Pollock, and more.   

194
00:09:58,148 --> 00:10:03,752
   A Pollock painting in 2015   
     went for $200 million.     

195
00:10:03,754 --> 00:10:05,420
  Only a few years before that, 

196
00:10:05,422 --> 00:10:09,174
          a Rothko went         
    for $86 million dollars.    

197
00:10:09,176 --> 00:10:11,676
   They're really big numbers   
            involved.           

198
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:14,346
  Narrator: This collection has 
     been hidden in storage     

199
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:16,164
          for decades.          

200
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:20,335
  But Rosales is not an expert  
    in abstract expressionism   

201
00:10:20,337 --> 00:10:25,023
       and her own gallery      
          is too small.         

202
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:27,609
    It doesn't seem to matter   
    that few in the art world   

203
00:10:27,611 --> 00:10:30,195
    have heard of Rosales...    

204
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:34,783
  This art is some of the most  
 valued art of the 20th century.

205
00:10:34,785 --> 00:10:38,036
  People paid tens of millions  
       of dollars for it,       

206
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:42,123
 and we haven't had anything new
       in it for a while.       

207
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,525
     Narrator: The gallery's    
   new director, Ann Freedman,  

208
00:10:44,527 --> 00:10:49,530
   is dazzled by the prospect   
          and profits.          

209
00:10:49,532 --> 00:10:51,583
 Up next on "American Greed"... 

210
00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:54,336
        Rosales' promise        
    of a trove of masterworks   

211
00:10:54,338 --> 00:10:56,388
     is too good to pass up.    

212
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:59,341
      Can you imagine being     
       the one to discover      

213
00:10:59,343 --> 00:11:01,810

     that old hand-me-down.     

243
00:13:20,817 --> 00:13:21,816
      Did you trade it in?      

244
00:13:21,851 --> 00:13:25,153
      My parents handed it      
   down to my little brother.   

245
00:13:25,188 --> 00:13:25,904
           You ready?           

246
00:13:25,956 --> 00:13:26,621
            Yeah...             

247
00:13:27,357 --> 00:13:29,073
           SURPRISE!            

248
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:30,858
      No. Not Beige Betty!      

249
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:32,744
         You guys can't         
   do this to me, seriously?!   

250
00:13:32,796 --> 00:13:34,629
         My car is like         
       a rite of passage.       

251
00:13:34,664 --> 00:13:36,047
       How do you expect        
       me to drive this?!       

252
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:38,583
      Just turn the key...      
   and yeah, it's just uh...    

253
00:13:38,635 --> 00:13:39,250
                 Some of this...

254
00:13:39,302 --> 00:13:39,968
      ...it's automatic...      

255
00:13:40,003 --> 00:13:41,135
      ...dual cupholders.       

256
00:13:41,171 --> 00:13:43,254
     <i> Go with the one that's</i>    
  <i> here to help life go right.</i>  

257
00:13:43,306 --> 00:14:15,503
          <i> State Farm.</i>          

258
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:19,040
      The communal feast.       

259
00:14:19,075 --> 00:14:20,542
            Potluck.            

260
00:14:20,577 --> 00:14:24,379
This parade of dishes will soon 
be yours to scrub.              

261
00:14:24,414 --> 00:14:26,080
    And they're not even...     

262
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:27,348
             Yours.             

263
00:14:27,384 --> 00:14:30,751
New and improved Dawn Ultra can 
finish off this buffet.         

264
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:34,138
  Each drop now has even more   
  grease-cleaning power.        

265
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:36,558
  So you can scrub 50% less,    

266
00:14:36,593 --> 00:14:38,877
      and get done faster.      

267
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:41,195
    Next month, their place!    

268
00:14:41,231 --> 00:14:51,022
  A drop of Dawn and grease is  
  gone.                         

269
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,283
     Narrator: Up until now,    
         Glafira Rosales        

270
00:15:02,285 --> 00:15:06,671
  has been circling the fringes 
   of the New York art scene.   

271
00:15:06,673 --> 00:15:09,173
    She didn't know that much   
           about art,           

272
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:10,725
     to be perfectly honest,    

273
00:15:10,727 --> 00:15:14,095
     but she picked up a lot    
   from the people around her.  

274
00:15:14,097 --> 00:15:16,464
   Narrator: Her new contact,   
          Ann Freedman,         

275
00:15:16,466 --> 00:15:18,483
          the director          
      of Knoedler Gallery,      

276
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:22,770
   has the power to launch her  
    into the upper echelons.    

277
00:15:22,772 --> 00:15:27,475
     Glafira was delivering     
         a great product        

278
00:15:27,477 --> 00:15:29,861
       that she knew would      
       catch the attention      

279
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:31,863
      of the right people.      

280
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:34,999
  Narrator: Glafira's portrayal 
    of the unassuming novice    

281
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:37,585
       is picture perfect.      

282
00:15:37,587 --> 00:15:40,138
         I always think         
      about the excitement      

283
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,940
     that Ann Freedman felt,    

284
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:44,409
       like the excitement      
         you might feel         

285
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:46,144
     finding dinosaur bones.    

286
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:49,614
 It's this unearthed discovery. 

287
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:52,350
     Narrator: But a slight     
       drawback emerges --      

288
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:54,185
      the recorded history      
          of ownership          

289
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:58,940
  that proves its authenticity  
     is called "provenance,"    

290
00:15:58,942 --> 00:16:01,442
     and this one is murky.     

291
00:16:01,444 --> 00:16:03,778
    Hernandez: Provenance is    
   a really important concept   

292
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,563
        in the art world.       

293
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:09,350
  The story was that they were  
     purchased by a family,     

294
00:16:09,352 --> 00:16:12,570
          a collector,          
    directly from the artist,   

295
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:15,440
     often purchased outside    
     the back of the gallery    

296
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:17,275
      in exchange for cash,     

297
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:19,210
     and they had been kept     
           in storage,          

298
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:21,412
     basically, for decades.    

299
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:23,681
  So if you believe that story, 

300
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:26,985
     the lack of provenance     
      actually makes sense.     

301
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:30,088
   Narrator: So over the next   
     decade, Glafira Rosales    

302
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:33,458
  provides Knoedler with a few  
    new paintings each year,    

303
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,660
      all by heavy hitters.     

304
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:39,364
   She sells additional works   
to art broker Julian Weissman --

305
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:41,816
  another New York art dealer.  

306
00:16:41,818 --> 00:16:43,601
                     ♪♪         

307
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:46,654
 Her anonymous collector, Mr. X,

308
00:16:46,656 --> 00:16:50,992
 turns out to be the gift horse 
      that keeps on giving.     

309
00:16:50,994 --> 00:16:52,944
The most high-profile artists --

310
00:16:52,946 --> 00:16:56,531
   Jackson Pollocks, Rothkos,   
          Motherwell's.         

311
00:16:56,533 --> 00:16:58,499
      I mean, you name it,      
          it was there.         

312
00:16:58,501 --> 00:17:00,368
    Narrator: And discretion    
         is fundamental         

313
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:01,902
     to the rare-art market,    

314
00:17:01,904 --> 00:17:05,757
   where collectors are often   
   tightlipped about selling.   

315
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:08,126
  Hernandez: Secrecy is highly  
    prized in the art world.    

316
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:09,343
      When you're a buyer,      

317
00:17:09,345 --> 00:17:10,628
      you're not entitled,      
          for example,          

318
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,096
   to know who the seller is,   

319
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:14,849
     or if a broker comes in    
      with a piece of art,      

320
00:17:14,851 --> 00:17:19,237
 they don't have to necessarily 
  disclose who their client is. 

321
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:22,140
    Narrator: Still, Rosales'   
        secret collector        

322
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:23,808
     poses a vexing setback     

323
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:27,061
          when it comes         
     to negotiating prices.     

324
00:17:27,063 --> 00:17:30,231
  The more provenance you have, 
    the more detail you have,   

325
00:17:30,233 --> 00:17:35,236
   the more likely the work is  
 gonna sell for a higher price, 

326
00:17:35,238 --> 00:17:37,872
  because the backup is there.  

327
00:17:37,874 --> 00:17:41,275
   Narrator: When Ann Freedman  
  pushes her for more details,  

328
00:17:41,277 --> 00:17:43,411
  Rosales names David Herbert,  

329
00:17:43,413 --> 00:17:47,281
 a deceased New York art dealer 
       as the go-between.       

330
00:17:47,283 --> 00:17:48,833
She hears the name David Herbert

331
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:52,553
     as someone who has been    
 associated with these artists, 

332
00:17:52,555 --> 00:17:56,340
      who was also part of      
 the gay community at the time. 

333
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:57,842
    And so, all of a sudden,    

334
00:17:57,844 --> 00:18:02,580
  David Herbert can be someone  
    who's connected to Mr. X.   

335
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,633
   Narrator: To help shore up   
      the murky provenance,     

336
00:18:05,635 --> 00:18:08,319
    Knoedler shows the works    
         to art experts         

337
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:09,937
     to get<i> their</i> opinions.     

338
00:18:09,939 --> 00:18:13,024
 Ann Freedman, Knoedler Gallery 
     showed these paintings,    

339
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:15,026
  including the very first one  
      that came in the door     

340
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:19,297
  to some of the finest experts 
  in the world on Mark Rothko.  

341
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:21,999
    They saw these paintings,   
        several of them,        

342
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:24,285
 and said these are convincing. 

343
00:18:24,287 --> 00:18:26,671
     Narrator: Art historian    
        Jack Flam recalls       

344
00:18:26,673 --> 00:18:30,508
 viewing a painting at Knoedler 
      by Robert Motherwell.     

345
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,760
       Flam: She showed me      
       a Motherwell elegy       

346
00:18:32,762 --> 00:18:34,929
      that was on the floor     
          in her office         

347
00:18:34,931 --> 00:18:37,832
        and she said that       
      she had just got it.      

348
00:18:37,834 --> 00:18:40,268
   Flam had been close friends  
         with Motherwell        

349
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,937
    until his death in 1991.    

350
00:18:42,939 --> 00:18:44,272
      The work is credited      

351
00:18:44,274 --> 00:18:46,724
     to Motherwell's Spanish    
         elegy series --        

352
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:49,277
       and it catches him       
          by surprise.          

353
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:53,114
   Flam: In the elegies, which  
 became his signature paintings.

354
00:18:53,116 --> 00:18:56,984
   From 1948 to when he died,   
            in 1991,            

355
00:18:56,986 --> 00:19:00,488
         he painted over        
     a 170 elegy paintings.     

356
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,523
          They're also          
      the paintings of his      

357
00:19:02,525 --> 00:19:05,576
  that fetch the highest prices 
         on the market.         

358
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:07,194
       Narrator: Freedman       
         never mentions         

359
00:19:07,196 --> 00:19:09,046
    the name Glafira Rosales.   

360
00:19:09,048 --> 00:19:12,083
       Instead, the works       
    are generally referred to   

361
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:14,886
  as "the Herbert Collection."  

362
00:19:14,888 --> 00:19:18,756
 And she asked me if I remember 
    correctly, at that time,    

363
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:22,660
    whether I had ever heard    
 of someone named David Herbert.

364
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,395
  And I said, "No, I had not."  

365
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:27,181
      And she said, "He was     
    a well-known art dealer."   

366
00:19:27,183 --> 00:19:28,549
   And, you know, at the time,  

367
00:19:28,551 --> 00:19:30,885
   I thought, "Well, you know,  
          that's nice."         

368
00:19:30,887 --> 00:19:33,688
   Narrator: Jack Flam doesn't  
      think of questioning      

369
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:36,240
      Knoedler's rock-solid     
           reputation.          

370
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:37,441
        And so, you know,       
       you're in Knoedler,      

371
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:38,893
     you don't think twice.     

372
00:19:38,895 --> 00:19:41,445
    Narrator: And, of course,   
     there's that added boon    

373
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:43,915
   for buyers who are willing   
            to accept           

374
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:46,834
   the lack of documentation.   
     Man: 1,400,000 is bid.     

375
00:19:46,836 --> 00:19:49,954
   These are artists that are   
 really, really difficult to get

376
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:52,456
        and that command        
     incredibly high prices.    

377
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,575
       Now imagine you can      
        get those works,        

378
00:19:54,577 --> 00:19:56,577
     and at a bargain price.    

379
00:19:56,579 --> 00:19:58,679
       So not only are you      
   a brilliant art collector,   

380
00:19:58,681 --> 00:20:00,798
      you're also a pretty      
       genius businessman.      

381
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:06,220
  Narrator: Some collectors are 
     more wary than others.     

382
00:20:06,222 --> 00:20:09,907
  Rosales sells this purported  
   Jackson Pollock to Knoedler  

383
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:13,978
          for $750,000.         

384
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:18,649
 In 2001, Knoedler turns around 
   and sells it to Jack Levy,   

385
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:23,020
 a co-chairman at Goldman Sachs,
         for $2 million.        

386
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:24,655
       With one caveat --       

387
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:26,473
   The sale hinges on Knoedler  

388
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,993
       obtaining a review       
   verifying its authenticity   

389
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:32,446
     from the International     
 Foundation for Art Research -- 

390
00:20:32,448 --> 00:20:35,950
   otherwise known as "IFAR."   

391
00:20:35,952 --> 00:20:38,819
      Nikas: It had a panel     
     of experts put together    

392
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:41,789
       to give their views      
       about the painting,      

393
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:43,257
    and they wrote a report.    

394
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:45,793
    Narrator: But IFAR won't    
      positively attribute      

395
00:20:45,795 --> 00:20:46,827
       the work to Pollock      

396
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:50,481
    and deems the provenance    
          questionable.         

397
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:53,084
   Knoedler discreetly cancels  
           Levy's sale          

398
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:55,353
   and refunds his $2 million,  

399
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:58,289
     but Knoedler's mission     
           is to sell.          

400
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:02,326
     Nikas: These works were    
        really exciting.        

401
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:06,013

     for their collections.     

403
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:12,370

   this relationship of trust.  

477
00:25:52,585 --> 00:25:57,354

 her daughter's musical talent. 

478
00:25:57,356 --> 00:25:59,990
     She would talk with her    
     every single birthday.     

479
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:01,659

     trust Glafira Rosales.

00:26:25,268 --> 00:26:27,968
  I'm not going to then take it 

487
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:29,470
 to find out if it's authentic. 

488
00:26:29,472 --> 00:26:31,522
   I bought it from Tiffany's.  

489
00:26:31,524 --> 00:26:33,674
       If I buy a painting      
     from Knoedler Gallery,     

490
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:36,894
        I have to assume        
   it's an authentic painting.  

491
00:26:36,896 --> 00:26:40,230
      It had that same kind     
         of reputation.         

492
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:43,033
           Hernandez:           
   Often, there'll be experts   
  who in their heart of hearts  

493
00:26:43,035 --> 00:26:46,287
 think that a painting is fake, 
  but they'll never express it. 

494
00:26:46,289 --> 00:26:48,405
     And part of that is due    
        to the politeness       

495
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:49,990
      of the art business,      

496
00:26:49,992 --> 00:26:53,544
   but really it's also driven  
   by the fear of being sued.   

497
00:26:53,546 --> 00:26:58,082
  Narrator: So in January 2007, 
     art historian Jack Flam    

498
00:26:58,084 --> 00:27:01,034
         is at odds when        
  a Robert Motherwell painting  

499
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:03,304
  pops up at Julian Weissman's, 

500
00:27:03,306 --> 00:27:05,089
  another New York art broker.  

501
00:27:05,091 --> 00:27:06,373
     We had no record of it,    

502
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:07,558
       and this is always       
         very exciting,         

503
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,727
     to see a new painting.     

504
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:11,979
 The "Spanish Elegy" reminds him

505
00:27:11,981 --> 00:27:15,933
    of the Motherwell he saw    
 in Freedman's office before... 

506
00:27:15,935 --> 00:27:19,336
  But there's something strange 
         in the details.        

507
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:21,939
     I had certain kind of,     
           in my gut,           

508
00:27:21,941 --> 00:27:23,607
      misgivings about it.      

509
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:26,493
   It was by then 50 years old  
           or more --           

510
00:27:26,495 --> 00:27:29,363
   and although it was warped   
        the front of it,        

511
00:27:29,365 --> 00:27:32,032
    the paint was not warped    
           or cracked,          

512
00:27:32,034 --> 00:27:34,151
        which looked odd.       

513
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:38,172
 Narrator: He holds his tongue, 
     despite his misgivings.    

514
00:27:38,174 --> 00:27:40,374
   Flam: You're always advised  
    not to police the market.   

515
00:27:40,376 --> 00:27:42,009
       It's not your job.       

516
00:27:42,011 --> 00:27:45,929
   But, nonetheless, you want   
 to protect your artist legacy. 

517
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:48,966
    Narrator: As it happens,    
     Flam is also president     

518
00:27:48,968 --> 00:27:51,218
   of the Dedalus Foundation,   

519
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,554
  founded by Robert Motherwell. 

520
00:27:53,556 --> 00:27:55,556
     Dedalus is in the midst    
          of compiling          

521
00:27:55,558 --> 00:27:58,925
      a catalogue raisonné      
         on Motherwell.         

522
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,427
      A catalogue raisonné      

523
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:04,765
         is a gathering         
 of all the works by an artist. 

524
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:09,069
        By common usage,        
     it becomes the standard    

525
00:28:09,071 --> 00:28:13,374
  for establishing what are the 
  authentic works by the artist 

526
00:28:13,376 --> 00:28:16,543
           and what is          
    their authentic history.    

527
00:28:16,545 --> 00:28:19,112
  Narrator: During the process, 
     researchers track down     

528
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,465
 every known work by Motherwell.

529
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:23,384
          They enter it         
       into their database      

530
00:28:23,386 --> 00:28:26,537
   and assign it an ID number.  

531
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:29,673
And you see the difference      
  in the late '58.              

532
00:28:29,675 --> 00:28:33,394
         I still kept that sense
               of spontaneity.  

533
00:28:33,396 --> 00:28:35,229
 While studying seven paintings 

534
00:28:35,231 --> 00:28:38,298
   attributed to Motherwell's   
     "Spanish Elegy" series,    

535
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,151
 they notice a striking anomaly.

536
00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:43,687
My team showed me digital images

537
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:47,140
   on the fronts and the backs  
     of the Spanish Elegies.    

538
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:53,697
  And there were six from 1953, 
   and this new one was 1955.   

539
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:56,450
      When we saw the back      
          of this one,          

540
00:28:56,452 --> 00:28:59,169
    we saw that it was signed   

541
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:03,640
        very much the way       
        the others were.        

542
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:06,326
 For example, Robert Motherwell,

543
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:09,663
     and then underneath it     
         the date, 1955.        

544
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:12,716
 And then on a painting that was
   supposed to have been done   

545
00:29:12,718 --> 00:29:16,720
  three years earlier, in 1953, 
           once again,          

546
00:29:16,722 --> 00:29:18,972
         "Spanish Elegy"        
       in quotation marks       

547
00:29:18,974 --> 00:29:22,609
and full caps on the top, almost
   exactly the same printing,   

548
00:29:22,611 --> 00:29:24,511
 and the date in the same place.

549
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:26,146
            Narrator:           
   But Motherwell's signature   

550
00:29:26,148 --> 00:29:28,232
  is known to be inconsistent.  

551
00:29:28,234 --> 00:29:29,817
Flam: Motherwell, in particular,

552
00:29:29,819 --> 00:29:33,237
  signed pictures in different  
   ways, in different months.   

553
00:29:33,239 --> 00:29:37,741
    So, this was a real tell.   
 This really made us suspicious.

554
00:29:37,743 --> 00:29:40,461
Narrator: Another tell has to do
      with the two words --     

555
00:29:40,463 --> 00:29:42,329
        "Spanish Elegy."        

556
00:29:42,331 --> 00:29:45,365
              Flam:             
   Now, this is something that  
 Motherwell himself often said, 

557
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:47,551
  "My Spanish Elegy paintings." 

558
00:29:47,553 --> 00:29:49,636
  Or "That's a Spanish Elegy."  

559
00:29:49,638 --> 00:29:52,339
     But he did not put that    
 on the backs of the paintings. 

560
00:29:52,341 --> 00:29:55,392
     And this is especially     
           significant          

561
00:29:55,394 --> 00:29:59,480
     because those paintings    
     that we were beginning     

562
00:29:59,482 --> 00:30:00,931
      to suspect were fakes     

563
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:03,517
          had the title         
    "Spanish Elegy" on them.    

564
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:04,902
    Narrator: Another "tell,"   

565
00:30:04,904 --> 00:30:07,654
  and the perhaps most damning  
         in Flam's mind,        

566
00:30:07,656 --> 00:30:09,606
    has to do with technique.   

567
00:30:09,608 --> 00:30:12,860
  As you look at the crispness  
  and the intensity with which  

568
00:30:12,862 --> 00:30:15,729
   the real paint is painted,   
      and you look at this,     

569
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:19,199
  which is all kind of muffled  
   and soft around the edges.   

570
00:30:19,201 --> 00:30:23,570
  Motherwell was very proud of  
     and very careful about     

571
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:30,410
       is the way in which      
   he used variations of edge.  

572
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:33,764
  So, you get very sharp edges, 
        very soft edges.        

573
00:30:33,766 --> 00:30:37,467
  So, that kind of variation is 
something very important to him,

574
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:40,938
     but the, something that    
   the forger misses entirely.  

575
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:44,107
    Narrator: Their findings    
     leave no doubt to Flam     

576
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:46,443
   that the elegies are fake.   

577
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:48,946
      For Dedalus, it just      
       begs the question,       

578
00:30:48,948 --> 00:30:52,098
    "Where did these pictures   
           come from?"          

579
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,400
 And going through the database,

580
00:30:53,402 --> 00:30:55,369
       we found that none       
        of these pictures       

581
00:30:55,371 --> 00:30:59,623
   had a provenance that went   
        back before 1999.       

582
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:05,629
  First owner for four of them  
 Ann Freedman, Knoedler Gallery.

583
00:31:05,631 --> 00:31:08,065
  Other three, Julian Weissman. 

584
00:31:08,067 --> 00:31:11,218
   This is more than bizarre.   

585
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:14,254
    You got seven paintings.    

586
00:31:14,256 --> 00:31:15,923
        Four of them come       
        from one gallery        

587
00:31:15,925 --> 00:31:17,958
    and they were almost like   
      one from one gallery,     

588
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,810
         the next year,

 begin using this kind of paint

            Narrator:           
     Flam makes the decision    
   to quietly contact the FBI.  

733
00:39:27,049 --> 00:39:31,167
 Jack Flam is probably the hero 
         of this story,         

734
00:39:31,169 --> 00:39:33,503
         because the FBI        
     was involved early on.     

735
00:39:33,505 --> 00:39:35,138
   But he kept it very quiet,   

736
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:39,109
 and other people who knew what 
was going on kept it very quiet,

737
00:39:39,111 --> 00:39:42,679
  which is the way that we can  
     do our investigations.

        through Knoedler,       

742
00:39:50,939 --> 00:39:52,355
   there was nothing but gaps.  

743
00:39:52,357 --> 00:39:54,074
     There was no paperwork.    

744

       There was no trail.

00:44:05,693 --> 00:44:08,945

819
00:44:08,947 --> 00:44:11,964

       not the only person

         Pierre Lagrange

  Jackson Pollock from Knoedler 

825
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:29,382
 in 2007 is ready to let it go.

     trouble unloading it...    

827
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,688
   He tried to sell it at one   
   of the big auction houses,   

828
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:37,273
  and they refused to sell it.  

829
00:44:37,275 --> 00:44:41,394
 And because of Jack Flam's tip,
     the FBI art crimes unit    

830
00:44:41,396 --> 00:44:44,063
      is now curious about

834

 Jason Hernandez joins the case,
  his first objective is clear. 

837
00:45:03,351 --> 00:45:05,301
  To get a criminal prosecution 
           for fraud,           

838
00:45:05,303 --> 00:45:08,020
        you have to prove       
    beyond a reasonable doubt   

839
00:45:08,022 --> 00:45:10,356
      that someone intended     
        to commit a fraud       

840
00:45:10,358 --> 00:45:12,942
  and that's the highest burden 
           in our law.          

841
00:45:12,944 --> 00:45:16,362

     the likeliest suspect,     

842
00:45:16,364 --> 00:45:19,031
    but it's not that simple.   

843
00:45:19,033 --> 00:45:20,483
   Hernandez: You want to try   
         and figure out         

844

      that are suspicious.      

847
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:28,624

         give us a clue         

848
00:45:28,626 --> 00:45:32,428
as to who's making the paintings
 and where they're coming from. 

849
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:35,081
            Narrator:           
     But every lead fizzles.    

850
00:45:35,083 --> 00:45:38,084
     He decides to dig at it    
      from another angle --     

851
00:45:38,086 --> 00:45:40,553
  the Internal Revenue Service. 

852
00:45:40,555 --> 00:45:42,705
   Savona: I had never worked   
      with the IRS before,      

853
00:45:42,707 --> 00:45:47,059
  and I thought, "Oh, man, now, 
 this is going to take forever."

854
00:45:47,061 --> 00:45:48,761
         And it didn't.         

855
00:45:48,763 --> 00:45:52,565
     Enter IRS Special Agent    
           Eric Jonke           

856
00:45:52,567 --> 00:45:54,984
      to follow the money.      

857
00:45:54,986 --> 00:45:57,069
     It's hard to walk away     
      from bank statements,     

858
00:45:57,071 --> 00:45:59,272
  wire transfers, and payments. 

859
00:45:59,274 --> 00:46:02,158
        Narrator: Between       
         2006 and 2011,         

860
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,311
   Rosales asked the galleries  
     to deposit her payments    

861
00:46:05,313 --> 00:46:07,563
 to two Spanish bank accounts --

862
00:46:07,565 --> 00:46:11,567
      BBVA and CAJA Madrid.     

863
00:46:11,569 --> 00:46:13,336
     During the three years     
      of the investigation      

864
00:46:13,338 --> 00:46:17,039
that we took into consideration,
  she received over $14 million 

865
00:46:17,041 --> 00:46:20,143
  from prominent New York City  
    galleries for the work --   

866
00:46:20,145 --> 00:46:22,261
        works of art that       
        she was selling.        

867
00:46:22,263 --> 00:46:24,931
      Narrator: And central     
        to Rosales' story       

868
00:46:24,933 --> 00:46:28,818
   is that she's an art broker  
     for her Spanish client.    

869
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:29,886
         If that's true,        

870
00:46:29,888 --> 00:46:33,473
        she would pay 90%       
    to her mysterious client    

871
00:46:33,475 --> 00:46:36,359
   and collect a standard fee   
             of 10%.            

872
00:46:36,361 --> 00:46:38,511
   She says she's representing  
            somebody.           

873
00:46:38,513 --> 00:46:42,348
 Well, it's obviously got to go 
        back to somebody.       

874
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:44,000
   And if it's not going back   
          to the person         

875
00:46:44,002 --> 00:46:47,937
she claims to be representing...

876
00:46:47,939 --> 00:46:50,807
      then there is nobody      
       she's representing.      

877
00:46:52,794 --> 00:46:54,827
   Jonke: The biggest red flag  
    was her sending the money   

878
00:46:54,829 --> 00:46:58,130
 directly overseas after selling
     the pieces of artwork.     

879
00:46:58,132 --> 00:47:01,717
 The nail in the coffin was that
 she wasn't paying any clients. 

880
00:47:01,719 --> 00:47:04,537
    Narrator: In particular,    
        Glafira Rosales'        

881
00:47:04,539 --> 00:47:08,057
    mysterious client, Mr. X.   

882
00:47:08,059 --> 00:47:11,594
     What that told us was,     
    that her story was false.   

883
00:47:11,596 --> 00:47:14,997
  There is no family in Europe  
   that owns these paintings.   

884
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:18,534
    These are paintings that    
    are almost certainly fake   

885
00:47:18,536 --> 00:47:20,503
         and that she's         
       pulling off a scam       

886
00:47:20,505 --> 00:47:23,639
      and keeping the money     
    in foreign bank accounts.   

887
00:47:23,641 --> 00:47:26,909
     The bank accounts link     
     to two new suspects --     

888
00:47:26,911 --> 00:47:31,280
    her long-time boyfriend,    
    Carlos Bergantiños Diaz,    

889
00:47:31,282 --> 00:47:34,617
     and his brother Jesus.     

890
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:37,370
      While it strengthens      
         the fraud case,        

891
00:47:37,372 --> 00:47:40,339
   it also breaks another case  
          wide open --          

892
00:47:40,341 --> 00:47:42,625
          tax evasion.          

893
00:47:42,627 --> 00:47:46,912
    During 2006-2008, we saw    
   her receive a ton of money   

894
00:47:46,914 --> 00:47:49,582
       and majority of it       
         sent overseas.         

895
00:47:49,584 --> 00:47:51,100
 So we were able to look at that

896
00:47:51,102 --> 00:47:53,636
  and see how much she reported 
       on her tax returns.      

897
00:47:53,638 --> 00:47:56,772
     She was reporting just     
    over $2 million received    

898
00:47:56,774 --> 00:47:58,441
     for those three years,     
          when in fact,         

899
00:47:58,443 --> 00:48:00,977
        she was receiving       
        over $14 million.       

900
00:48:00,979 --> 00:48:03,446
    She was reporting peanuts   
       on her tax returns.      

901
00:48:03,448 --> 00:48:05,231
         So from there,         
 she's understating her income, 

902
00:48:05,233 --> 00:48:06,782
    lying on her tax returns,   

903
00:48:06,784 --> 00:48:09,902
    and she's also hiding the   
 Spanish bank accounts overseas.

904
00:48:09,904 --> 00:48:13,990
     Narrator: In May 2013,     
   Glafira Rosales is charged   

905
00:48:13,992 --> 00:48:17,493
     and held for tax fraud     
      and money laundering.     

906
00:48:17,495 --> 00:48:19,545
   If convicted of all counts,  

907
00:48:19,547 --> 00:48:23,082
       she's looking at up      
     to 34 years in prison.     

908
00:48:23,084 --> 00:48:26,118
      In the ensuing weeks,     
 Pierre Lagrange sends Knoedler 

909
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:29,221
     an expert's report that    
  the Jackson Pollock painting  

910
00:48:29,223 --> 00:48:32,124
  he purchased for $17 million  

911
00:48:32,126 --> 00:48:34,093
      is yet another fake.      

912
00:48:34,095 --> 00:48:39,599
One day later, the long-esteemed
    gallery closes its doors.   

913
00:48:39,601 --> 00:48:41,617
       Hernandez: Over 60       
       of these paintings       

914
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:43,469

915

       Narrator: In 2013,       
        Glafira Rosales'        

976
00:53:03,748 --> 00:53:08,000
  astonishing 15-year art scam  
       appears to be over.      

977
00:53:08,002 --> 00:53:11,570
       She got so enamored      
      of what she was doing     

978
00:53:11,572 --> 00:53:13,672
    and thought that she was    
          so good at it         

979
00:53:13,674 --> 00:53:16,408
    that she would absolutely   
        never get caught.       

980
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:18,177
 Narrator: But now if Rosales is

981
00:53:18,179 --> 00:53:20,563
        convicted on tax        
     and wire fraud charges,    

982
00:53:20,565 --> 00:53:24,750
       she faces more than      
   three decades behind bars.   

983
00:53:24,752 --> 00:53:27,269
      The magistrate judge      
        denied her bail.        

984
00:53:27,271 --> 00:53:30,556
     And her being detained,    
       held without bail,       

985
00:53:30,558 --> 00:53:32,391
       probably caused her      
       to think real hard       

986
00:53:32,393 --> 00:53:35,211
   about what her options were  
          in this case.         

987
00:53:35,213 --> 00:53:37,913
     Glafira Rosales admits     
         to passing off         

988
00:53:37,915 --> 00:53:39,615
     fake paintings as real,    

989
00:53:39,617 --> 00:53:43,485
 with the help of her boyfriend,
  Jose Carlos Bergantiños Diaz, 

990
00:53:43,487 --> 00:53:45,404
     and his brother, Jesus.    

991
00:53:45,406 --> 00:53:48,106
           Hernandez:           
  One of the things that makes  
  a fraud like this successful  

992
00:53:48,108 --> 00:53:49,875
   is a good false provenance.  

993
00:53:49,877 --> 00:53:53,412
    And the Bergantiños Diaz    
  brothers were adept at that.  

994
00:53:53,414 --> 00:53:56,732
   They would conduct research  
    in the historical record,   

995
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:58,934
            in books,           
    anything they could find    

996
00:53:58,936 --> 00:54:03,038
 so that when the paintings were
  passed off it was believable. 

997
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,008
     Narrator: Glafira also     
    names the artist forger,    

998
00:54:06,010 --> 00:54:11,096
  an elderly Chinese immigrant  
 in Queens named Pei-Shen Qian. 

999
00:54:11,098 --> 00:54:16,435
   For 15 years, Pei-Shen Qian  
     became Jackson Pollock,    

1000
00:54:16,437 --> 00:54:20,072
       Robert Motherwell,       
    Franz Kline, Mark Rothko,   

1001
00:54:20,074 --> 00:54:22,107
  and any a number of artists.  

1002
00:54:22,109 --> 00:54:25,294
     Narrator: In the 1970s,    
  Qian used to paint portraits  

1003
00:54:25,296 --> 00:54:27,863
         of Chairman Mao        
    for schools and factories   

1004
00:54:27,865 --> 00:54:31,149
       before immigrating       
      to the United States.     

1005
00:54:31,151 --> 00:54:35,170
    He didn't have much luck    
 as a serious artist in the U.S.

1006
00:54:35,172 --> 00:54:37,289
          and resorted          
      to hustling portraits     

1007
00:54:37,291 --> 00:54:40,292
 on the sidewalks of Manhattan. 

1008
00:54:40,294 --> 00:54:44,096
       This is someone who      
      Jose Bergantiños Diaz     

1009
00:54:44,098 --> 00:54:45,714
    and Glafira Rosales found   

1010
00:54:45,716 --> 00:54:48,467
 just painting in New York City 
            one day,            

1011
00:54:48,469 --> 00:54:49,969
    and they challenged him.    

1012
00:54:49,971 --> 00:54:52,972
    They explained how buyers   
  are simply looking for works  

1013
00:54:52,974 --> 00:54:56,442
        in the manner of        
 Abstract Expressionist masters.

1014
00:54:56,444 --> 00:54:58,343
     They asked him to paint    

1015
00:54:58,345 --> 00:55:00,562
          in the style          
      of Rothko or Pollock      

1016
00:55:00,564 --> 00:55:02,531
    to see if he could do it.   

1017
00:55:02,533 --> 00:55:05,651
  And not only could he do it.  
      He could do it well.      

1018
00:55:05,653 --> 00:55:09,688
Narrator: For the next 15 years,
 in his modest studio in Queens,

1019
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:14,827
  Pei-Shen Qian creates dozens  
         of look-alikes.        

1020
00:55:14,829 --> 00:55:19,031
   This is a painting created   
  by Pei-Shen Qian, the forger. 

1021
00:55:19,033 --> 00:55:22,001
 It's a painting that's supposed
    to look like Mark Rothko.   

1022
00:55:22,003 --> 00:55:24,303
 It had the right color scheme, 

1023
00:55:24,305 --> 00:55:27,539
       had the right style      
       for a Mark Rothko.       

1024
00:55:27,541 --> 00:55:29,258
  You can see if you get close, 

1025
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:31,260
       you can see some of      
      the brush strokes --      

1026
00:55:31,262 --> 00:55:34,179
       all consistent with      
     the way Rothko painted.    

1027
00:55:34,181 --> 00:55:37,933
Narrator: But it takes more than
technique to fool savvy dealers.

1028
00:55:37,935 --> 00:55:39,435
      According to Rosales,     

1029
00:55:39,437 --> 00:55:44,106
  that's where Jose stepped in  
      to add his expertise.     

1030
00:55:44,108 --> 00:55:46,575
      Hernandez: You needed     
   older canvas for a painting  

1031
00:55:46,577 --> 00:55:48,610
      that's supposed to be     
          60 years old.         

1032
00:55:48,612 --> 00:55:50,062
        So, they would go       
         to flea markets        

1033
00:55:50,064 --> 00:55:52,564
     and look for paintings     
     that were the right age    

1034
00:55:52,566 --> 00:55:55,284
      and frames that were      
        of the right age.       

1035
00:55:55,286 --> 00:55:57,586
     Narrator: Once Pei-Shen    
      finished a painting,      

1036
00:55:57,588 --> 00:56:01,206
        Bergantiños added       
      another touch of age.     

1037
00:56:01,208 --> 00:56:02,458
  Hernandez: He would do things 

1038
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:04,176
           like empty           
   the vacuum cleaner dustbin   

1039
00:56:04,178 --> 00:56:06,411
       into the paintings       
          so that dust          

1040
00:56:06,413 --> 00:56:08,764
     and dirt would get into    
  the crevices of the painting  

1041
00:56:08,766 --> 00:56:12,634
   as you would expect to find  
      in an older painting.     

1042
00:56:12,636 --> 00:56:15,888
 And he would stain the canvases
          with tea bags         

1043
00:56:15,890 --> 00:56:19,775
 and do other things to them to 
give them the appearance of age.

1044
00:56:19,777 --> 00:56:24,113
  Narrator: Lastly, Bergantiños 
       forges a signature.      

1045
00:56:24,115 --> 00:56:26,148
  You can see, it's white paint 

1046
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:29,952
      that he used to paint     
        the actual words,       

1047
00:56:29,954 --> 00:56:33,989
     but when you get close,    
 you can see a brown tint to it,

1048
00:56:33,991 --> 00:56:36,441
        and it looks old        
        to the naked eye.       

1049
00:56:36,443 --> 00:56:39,545
 But when you actually test it, 

1050
00:56:39,547 --> 00:56:44,383
        the brown is not        
       from grime or age.       

1051
00:56:44,385 --> 00:56:46,502
  It's, like, a varnish on top  

1052
00:56:46,504 --> 00:56:49,138
        to make the white       
        not so brilliant.       

1053
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:50,756
  Narrator: But in some cases,  

1054
00:56:50,758 --> 00:56:53,675
          the red flags         
   where remarkably apparent.   

1055
00:56:53,677 --> 00:56:56,795
  Like, if anyone had bothered  
 to look closer at this Pollock 

1056
00:56:56,797 --> 00:56:59,848
that hung on Ann Freedman's wall
          for decades.          

1057
00:56:59,850 --> 00:57:03,318
   The signature for this work  
          is down here,         

1058
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:06,105
   in the lower right corner.   

1059
00:57:06,107 --> 00:57:10,242
     You can see the forger     
 didn't spell Pollock correctly.

1060
00:57:10,244 --> 00:57:13,745
         It appears that        
       he left out a "C."       

1061
00:57:13,747 --> 00:57:15,647
     Narrator: Investigators    
           aren't sure          

1062
00:57:15,649 --> 00:57:19,501
   whether Pei-Shen Qian is on  
 to the scam from the beginning,

1063
00:57:19,503 --> 00:57:22,921
         but it's clear         
    he eventually caught on.    

1064
00:57:22,923 --> 00:57:26,375
 As a matter of fact, there came
     a time where he learned    

1065
00:57:26,377 --> 00:57:29,111
     how much the paintings     
      were being sold for,      

1066
00:57:29,113 --> 00:57:31,513
   and he negotiated a raise.   

1067
00:57:31,515 --> 00:57:35,667
 IRS agent Eric Jonke determines
       that Pei-Shen Qian       

1068
00:57:35,669 --> 00:57:37,803
            gets paid           
   a few thousand dollars each  

1069
00:57:37,805 --> 00:57:42,558
    for his imitations of top   
    Abstract Expressionists.    

1070
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,560
     Jonke: Mr. Bergantiños     
         was paying him         

1071
00:57:44,562 --> 00:57:47,345
 $3,000 to $8,000 per painting, 

1072
00:57:47,347 --> 00:57:49,364
    which is peanuts compared   
      to what Miss Rosales      

1073
00:57:49,366 --> 00:57:50,782
 was initially selling them for.

1074
00:57:50,784 --> 00:57:53,402
       She's selling them       
    for hundreds of thousands   

1075
00:57:53,404 --> 00:57:55,404
     to millions of dollars.    

1076
00:57:55,406 --> 00:57:57,623
  Narrator: In September 2013,  

1077
00:57:57,625 --> 00:58:01,276
  Glafira Rosales pleads guilty 
     in court to wire fraud,    

1078
00:58:01,278 --> 00:58:05,247
        money laundering,       
        and tax evasion.        

1079
00:58:05,249 --> 00:58:07,282
 By the time Glafira confesses, 

1080
00:58:07,284 --> 00:58:11,687
     Pei-Shen Qian has fled     
         back to China.         

1081
00:58:11,689 --> 00:58:15,090
     If fame and fortune was    
     what he was hoping for,    

1082
00:58:15,092 --> 00:58:17,843
  then perhaps he is a success. 

1083
00:58:17,845 --> 00:58:20,045
      Nikas: His works were     
      in prominent museums.     

1084
00:58:20,047 --> 00:58:23,048
 They sold for tens of millions 
  of dollars in the aggregate.  

1085
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:26,351
     He was a famous artist,    
     but not for who he was,    

1086
00:58:26,353 --> 00:58:29,271
but who he was pretending to be.

1087
00:58:29,273 --> 00:58:31,556
      Narrator: Jose Carlos     
        Bergantiños Diaz        

1088
00:58:31,558 --> 00:58:35,611
      and his brother have      
     taken refuge in Spain.     

1089
00:58:35,613 --> 00:58:38,197
  In 2016, Spanish courts rule  

1090
00:58:38,199 --> 00:58:40,949
       against extraditing      
        60-year-old Diaz.       

1091
00:58:40,951 --> 00:58:46,788
    He and his brother still    
    face charges in the U.S.    

1092
00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:47,956
       Here in the States,      

1093
00:58:47,958 --> 00:58:51,576
     Glafira Rosales is left    
        holding the bag.        

1094
00:58:51,578 --> 00:58:55,797
       She got nine months      
       of home detention,       

1095
00:58:55,799 --> 00:58:58,767
       and she's got some       
    supervised released time    

1096
00:58:58,769 --> 00:59:04,773
     and she got restitution    
         and forfeiture         

1097
00:59:04,775 --> 00:59:09,061
           to the tune          
      of about $81 million.     

1098
00:59:09,063 --> 00:59:11,697
    Narrator: In her defense,   
      attorneys argued that     

1099
00:59:11,699 --> 00:59:14,816
       Glafira's boyfriend      
    put her up to the scheme.   

1100
00:59:14,818 --> 00:59:18,537
     He was the one who had     
      found the art forger,     

1101
00:59:18,539 --> 00:59:22,241
    who then supplied Glafira   
   Rosales with the paintings.  

1102
00:59:22,243 --> 00:59:25,043
     A string of civil cases    
         have been filed        

1103
00:59:25,045 --> 00:59:26,578
   against Knoedler & Company,  

1104
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:29,414
    art dealers Ann Freedman    
      and Julian Weissman,      

1105
00:59:29,416 --> 00:59:32,000
 and others taken in by Rosales.

1106
00:59:32,002 --> 00:59:35,470
    No criminal charges were    
       filed against<i> them.</i>      

1107
00:59:35,472 --> 00:59:37,622
      This is so egregious      
      that there are people     

1108
00:59:37,624 --> 00:59:41,126
   who will go to their grave   
   saying, "Ann Freedman knew.  

1109
00:59:41,128 --> 00:59:42,594
   The Knoedler Gallery knew.   

1110
00:59:42,596 --> 00:59:45,130
      Julian Weissman knew.     
    How could they not know?"   

1111
00:59:45,132 --> 00:59:47,983
     Because they themselves    
  have never been on that end,  

1112
00:59:47,985 --> 00:59:50,402
     and they don't realize     
       what it means to be      

1113
00:59:50,404 --> 00:59:52,955
   the victim of a con artist.  

1114
00:59:52,957 --> 00:59:57,142
     Nikas: Glafira Rosales     
     really embedded herself    

1115
00:59:57,144 --> 01:00:00,078
        in the art world        
        in a careful way        

1116
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:02,247
  that allowed Knoedler Gallery 

1117
01:00:02,249 --> 01:00:03,665
    to look at the situation    
            and say,            

1118
01:00:03,667 --> 01:00:05,667
   "This is convincing to us."  

1119
01:00:05,669 --> 01:00:08,120
    Narrator: Julian Weissman   
       declined to comment      

1120
01:00:08,122 --> 01:00:09,821
      for "American Greed."     

1121
01:00:09,823 --> 01:00:13,375
  To date, most of the lawsuits 
 have been settled out of court.

1122
01:00:13,377 --> 01:00:18,013
   The defendants have denied   
         any wrongdoing.        

1123
01:00:18,015 --> 01:00:20,015
       Art and jewelry are      
    the last sort of bastions
