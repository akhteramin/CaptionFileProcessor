1
00:00:01,452 --> 00:00:02,952
   - Your record hasn't been    
      that good, you know?      

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,487
           - I know.            
       - But you changed.       

3
00:00:05,556 --> 00:00:07,690
         - The warm-up,         
    you have this guy here.     

4
00:00:07,758 --> 00:00:09,458
   - Hey, you trying to take    
       my brother's job?        
          - Nah, nah.           

5
00:00:09,527 --> 00:00:10,993
       Why don't you get        
       a haircut though?        

6
00:00:11,062 --> 00:00:12,461
           (laughter)           

7
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,332
   - I don't have the means.    
     I only have 75¢ on me.     

8
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:20,770
          (announcer)           
     This is the courtroom      
     of Judge Frank Caprio,     

9
00:00:20,838 --> 00:00:23,439
     where people and cases     
    are met with compassion.    

10
00:00:23,508 --> 00:00:25,641
   A different kind of judge.   

11
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,643
          A courtroom           
         like no other.         

12
00:00:27,712 --> 00:00:29,712
This is "Caught in Providence." 

13
00:00:31,182 --> 00:00:33,015
     - Bertrand Brousseau.      

14
00:00:33,084 --> 00:00:35,918
     - Morning, Your Honor.     
        - Morning, sir.         

15
00:00:35,987 --> 00:00:37,420
         Mr. Brousseau,         
        you have a, uh,         

16
00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:39,722
      expired meter ticket      
        on Angel Street.        

17
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:42,225
   - I paid that three times.   
          - (laughing)          

18
00:00:42,294 --> 00:00:44,661
  - Three times, and number--   

19
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:47,430
      Let me just give you      
    a little quick rundown.     

20
00:00:47,499 --> 00:00:49,466
          - All right.          
      - My daughter works       

21
00:00:49,534 --> 00:00:51,801
    on top of the bookstore     
       on Thayer Street.        

22
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,336
         - Yeah, okay.          
   - All right, third floor.    

23
00:00:53,405 --> 00:00:54,871
    Her office is up there.     

24
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,140
     It was the day before      
         her birthday.          

25
00:00:57,209 --> 00:01:00,243
         I went to drop         
     something off to her.      

26
00:01:00,312 --> 00:01:02,078
       I-- She was busy.        
          I know that.          

27
00:01:02,147 --> 00:01:05,715
   So I just dropped it off.    
      Took me 30 seconds.       

28
00:01:05,784 --> 00:01:09,586
     30 seconds to get down     
   the stairs, up the stairs.   

29
00:01:09,655 --> 00:01:11,054
       But anyways, um--        

30
00:01:11,123 --> 00:01:12,823
      - You sure it wasn't      
          15 seconds?           

31
00:01:12,891 --> 00:01:16,226
 - I-- It was closer than that. 
        I'm handicapped.        

32
00:01:16,295 --> 00:01:19,162
       But, uh, anyways,        
           the, uh...           

33
00:01:19,231 --> 00:01:21,498
     the meter had expired.     

34
00:01:21,567 --> 00:01:23,934
  And I had put eight quarters  
      in the stupid thing       

35
00:01:24,003 --> 00:01:25,869
          and it still          
      didn't go anywhere.       

36
00:01:25,938 --> 00:01:29,339
     I put a sign on it...      
        "broken meter."         

37
00:01:29,408 --> 00:01:31,708
  The lady tagged me anyways.   

38
00:01:31,777 --> 00:01:33,744
     I went and found her.      

39
00:01:33,813 --> 00:01:36,947
 I was probably in that office  
          15 minutes.           

40
00:01:37,016 --> 00:01:40,985
  I said, you know, what is--   
          so, anyways.          

41
00:01:41,053 --> 00:01:45,656
    But they were chasing me    
 and I kept paying 25, 25, 25.  

42
00:01:45,725 --> 00:01:47,992
    It never got caught up.     
     I gave 'em 50 already.     

43
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:48,993
         - (chuckling)          
          - I think--           

44
00:01:49,061 --> 00:01:50,928
   No, I think I gave 'em 75.   

45
00:01:50,997 --> 00:01:52,530
     - Thought you gave 50.     

46
00:01:52,598 --> 00:01:54,699
  - No, some-- well, somebody.  

47
00:01:54,767 --> 00:01:56,400
       - No, don't fight        
         with a judge.          

48
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:59,136
 - All right, whatever you say. 
     Anyways, Your Honor--      

49
00:01:59,205 --> 00:02:00,304
- All right, well, let me tell--
           (laughing)           

50
00:02:00,373 --> 00:02:02,006
 Let me tell you what happened. 

51
00:02:02,075 --> 00:02:03,407
   You got the ticket, right?   

52
00:02:03,476 --> 00:02:05,143
            - Yeah.             

53
00:02:05,211 --> 00:02:06,511
       - And you paid it.       

54
00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:07,512
            - Yeah.             

55
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,780
    - But when you paid it,     

56
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:10,681
      14 days had expired.      

57
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,017
         Listen to me.          
            14 days.            

58
00:02:13,086 --> 00:02:14,719
     They give you 14 days      
       to pay the ticket.       

59
00:02:14,788 --> 00:02:17,422
            - Okay.             
     - If you don't pay it      
    in 14 days, it doubles.     

60
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,857
      So what happened was      
       the ticket doubled       

61
00:02:19,926 --> 00:02:21,826
    'cause you didn't pay it    
          in 14 days,           

62
00:02:21,895 --> 00:02:23,561
        so you paid $25.        

63
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,729
            - Right.            
            - Right?            

64
00:02:24,798 --> 00:02:26,498
       Then they sent you       
        a notice saying,        

65
00:02:26,566 --> 00:02:30,035
     "You owe us another 25     
'cause you paid that one late." 

66
00:02:30,103 --> 00:02:32,504
      Then you didn't pay       
       that one for 14--        

67
00:02:32,572 --> 00:02:35,740
    Then you waited 14 days     
     and you paid that one.     

68
00:02:35,809 --> 00:02:38,610
      So they took that 25      
and they sent you another notice

69
00:02:38,679 --> 00:02:41,346
       saying, "You paid        
         the second 25,         

70
00:02:41,415 --> 00:02:43,515
      but you didn't do it      
        within 14 days."        

71
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,050
       - It's worse than        
        Bank of America,        

72
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:46,718
     you know what I mean?      

73
00:02:46,787 --> 00:02:49,054
     - You're gonna pay 25      
   for the rest of your life    

74
00:02:49,123 --> 00:02:50,956
        every two weeks.        
       - Right, exactly.        

75
00:02:51,025 --> 00:02:53,659
  - All right, I'm gonna dis--  
 I'm gonna dismiss the balance. 

76
00:02:53,727 --> 00:02:56,595
          - All right.          
        - Not only that,        
  I'm gonna give you a credit.  

77
00:02:56,664 --> 00:02:59,898
  I'm gonna give you a credit   
for the extra 25 that you paid. 

78
00:02:59,967 --> 00:03:02,501
          - All right.          
       - Because you have       
     a red light violation.     

79
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,169
        - There you go.         

80
00:03:04,238 --> 00:03:06,572
 - This is on Smith and River.  
            - Right.            

81
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,006
     - Do you wanna tell me     
      anything about that?      

82
00:03:08,075 --> 00:03:09,475
   - Yeah, I'm gonna tell you   
          about that.           

83
00:03:09,543 --> 00:03:11,443
           (laughter)           

84
00:03:11,512 --> 00:03:13,712
       I was on my way--        
  - It's your daughter again.   

85
00:03:13,781 --> 00:03:15,080
          I can tell.           
         - No, listen.          

86
00:03:15,149 --> 00:03:17,850
    I was on my way to, uh,     
      say a prayer for you      

87
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:20,820
       and for everybody,       
      to Saint Jude Novena      

88
00:03:20,888 --> 00:03:23,289
            up on...            
    on, uh, Chatham Street.     

89
00:03:23,357 --> 00:03:25,658
      - You prayed for me?      
       - Yeah, of course.       

90
00:03:25,727 --> 00:03:29,061
      And, uh... anyways.       

91
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,863
    The, uh-- I had bad news    
        from my doctor.         

92
00:03:30,932 --> 00:03:32,765
   - If he's praying for me,    
      he's gotta go back,       
       do a little more.        

93
00:03:32,834 --> 00:03:35,701
      - Listen, I had bad,      
    bad news from my doctor.    

94
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,870
I was stopped at the red light, 
         first of all,          

95
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:39,405
     and I'm looking at it.     

96
00:03:39,474 --> 00:03:40,773
       I wasn't texting.        

97
00:03:40,842 --> 00:03:42,475
       I was just looking       
       to see what the--        

98
00:03:42,544 --> 00:03:44,711
     what I had to pick up      
           and stuff.           

99
00:03:44,779 --> 00:03:46,879
         And then I see         
       the light's green,       

100
00:03:46,948 --> 00:03:48,848
      so-so I put it down,      

101
00:03:48,917 --> 00:03:51,417
      then all the sudden       
      it turned red, boom.      

102
00:03:51,486 --> 00:03:54,954
    52 years I wait my life     
          to see you.           

103
00:03:55,023 --> 00:03:57,724
         - (chuckling)          
          - 52 years.           

104
00:03:57,792 --> 00:04:00,059
      - You never had a--       
  - And I'm-- And I'm French.   

105
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,061
        - You never had         
      a moving violation?       

106
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,963
        - Never, never.         

107
00:04:04,032 --> 00:04:05,899
     Except for that stupid     
   parking ticket over there.   

108
00:04:05,967 --> 00:04:07,767
      I thought they were       
    gonna hang me for that.     

109
00:04:07,836 --> 00:04:10,370
- We're gonna take a look at it,
      Mr. Brousseau, okay?      

110
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:12,539
       We're gonna take--       
    - Oh, no, I definitely--    

111
00:04:12,608 --> 00:04:14,074
 I definitely went through it.  

112
00:04:14,142 --> 00:04:16,610
      - Well, let me take       
         a look at it.          
      - Okay, if you want.      

113
00:04:16,678 --> 00:04:19,212
         (Judge Caprio)         
      The light is yellow.      

114
00:04:19,281 --> 00:04:21,014
           It's red.            

115
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,582
    Boy, you were speeding.     

116
00:04:22,651 --> 00:04:24,418
        - No, I wasn't.         

117
00:04:24,486 --> 00:04:26,186
             - Wow.             
     How fast was he going?     

118
00:04:26,255 --> 00:04:28,622
          - (man) 34.           
             - 34?              

119
00:04:28,691 --> 00:04:30,791
         You were doing         
       34 miles an hour.        

120
00:04:30,859 --> 00:04:32,159
         Look at that.          

121
00:04:32,228 --> 00:04:33,994
  - Maybe I did go through it.  

122
00:04:34,063 --> 00:04:35,496
           (laughter)           

123
00:04:35,564 --> 00:04:37,865
        I don't know why        
     I'm arguing with you.      

124
00:04:37,933 --> 00:04:39,533
            Anyways.            
        - Wait a minute.        

125
00:04:39,602 --> 00:04:41,402
      You just said to me       
     you were looking down.     

126
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,603
    - What I thought, yeah.     

127
00:04:42,671 --> 00:04:44,538
    - You went right through    
           the light.           

128
00:04:44,607 --> 00:04:47,441
      - Saint-- Saint Jude      
     wasn't driving, right?     

129
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,410
    - No, Saint Christopher,    
    he jumped out of the car    

130
00:04:49,478 --> 00:04:50,744
        a long time ago.        
    - (Quinn) He jumped out?    

131
00:04:50,813 --> 00:04:53,380
    He saw you were driving,    
         he jumped out.         

132
00:04:53,449 --> 00:04:55,082
           (laughter)           

133
00:04:55,151 --> 00:04:56,884
       - Inspector Quinn,       
         we have the--          

134
00:04:56,953 --> 00:05:00,554
     we have the Saint Jude     
         defense today.         

135
00:05:00,623 --> 00:05:02,623
      - (Bertrand) Anyway.      
      - You keep looking.       

136
00:05:02,692 --> 00:05:05,626
        - I don't know.         

137
00:05:05,695 --> 00:05:08,729
  Now I can't even see my car.  

138
00:05:08,798 --> 00:05:10,264
        - Anything else         
       you wanna tell me?       

139
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,500
 - Nah, just tell me how much.  

140
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:14,502
           (laughter)           

141
00:05:17,107 --> 00:05:18,673
 - All my friends are Italian.  

142
00:05:18,742 --> 00:05:20,341
    They all grab my money.     
     You know what I mean?      

143
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,210
            - Ohh...            

144
00:05:22,278 --> 00:05:23,645
         - (chuckling)          

145
00:05:23,713 --> 00:05:26,014
         - Your Honor,          
    you're doing a good job.    

146
00:05:26,082 --> 00:05:29,217
    And these-- the warm-up,    
    you have this guy here,     

147
00:05:29,286 --> 00:05:31,452
     I don't know how come      
   he gets paid but to warm--   

148
00:05:31,521 --> 00:05:34,355
          warm us up.           
         - (Quinn) Wow.         

149
00:05:34,424 --> 00:05:35,757
           (Bertrand)           
       He's the warm-up.        

150
00:05:35,826 --> 00:05:38,026
   - Now you're-- Now you're,   
      uh, buttering me up.      

151
00:05:38,095 --> 00:05:39,728
     - Yeah, there you go.      
        I want his job.         

152
00:05:39,796 --> 00:05:41,329
       Look at all the--        
- (Judge Caprio) Oh, yeah, now. 

153
00:05:41,398 --> 00:05:43,465
   - Look at the electricity    
       we're paying for.        

154
00:05:43,533 --> 00:05:45,233
           (laughter)           

155
00:05:45,302 --> 00:05:46,868
         - Now you're--         
        It's my brother.        

156
00:05:46,937 --> 00:05:48,436
       - Ahh, that's why.       

157
00:05:48,505 --> 00:05:50,071
    - You're trying to take     
       my brother's job?        

158
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,174
          - Nah, nah.           
       Why don't you get        
       a haircut though?        

159
00:05:52,242 --> 00:05:53,542
            (Quinn)             
              Ooh.              

160
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:56,178
           (laughter)           

161
00:05:56,246 --> 00:05:58,780
      - You guys are tough      
   on all these other people.   

162
00:05:58,849 --> 00:06:00,983
        Be tough on me.         
           Arrest me.           

163
00:06:01,051 --> 00:06:02,684
- The parking ticket has been-- 
         has been paid.         

164
00:06:02,753 --> 00:06:03,852
    I'm gonna dismiss that.     

165
00:06:03,921 --> 00:06:05,387
            - Okay.             
          - All right.          

166
00:06:05,456 --> 00:06:07,489
    The red light violation.    

167
00:06:07,558 --> 00:06:09,258
      It's your first one       
          in 52 years.          

168
00:06:09,326 --> 00:06:11,426
            - Yeah.             

169
00:06:11,495 --> 00:06:14,329
      - You paid $25 extra      

170
00:06:14,398 --> 00:06:18,767
         for the, uh...         
    for the parking ticket.     

171
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,402
  So here's what I'm gonna do.  

172
00:06:20,471 --> 00:06:24,940
    I'm gonna charge you $35    
 court costs on the red light,  

173
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,142
     give you a $25 credit      
         that you paid          

174
00:06:27,211 --> 00:06:28,711
    for the parking ticket.     

175
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:30,346
  So it's gonna cost you $10.   

176
00:06:30,414 --> 00:06:31,881
     - For the whole thing?     

177
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:34,817
           (laughter)           

178
00:06:34,886 --> 00:06:36,886
    And hey, give me the 10.    
     - (Quinn) Your Honor--     

179
00:06:36,954 --> 00:06:38,387
        - Give me the 10        
      out of your pocket.       

180
00:06:38,456 --> 00:06:39,488
     You said it'd be less      
           than that.           

181
00:06:39,557 --> 00:06:42,058
           (laughter)           

182
00:06:42,126 --> 00:06:44,527
          - Good luck.          
    - Thank you, Your Honor.    

183
00:06:44,596 --> 00:06:47,263
          - (laughing)          

184
00:06:47,332 --> 00:06:49,098
  - Even though Mr. Brousseau   
           is French            

185
00:06:49,167 --> 00:06:51,667
      and Joe is Italian,       
 they have one thing in common. 

186
00:06:51,736 --> 00:06:55,905
     They love to bust ba--     
    excuse me-- bust chops.     

187
00:06:55,974 --> 00:06:57,540
      - Hey, there you go.      
        I want his job.         

188
00:06:57,609 --> 00:07:00,576
- Now you're-- It's my brother. 
       - Ahh, that's why.       

189
00:07:00,645 --> 00:07:02,211
      - You trying to take      
       my brother's job?        

190
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,314
          - Nah, nah.           
       Why don't you get        
       a haircut though?        

191
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,582
            (Quinn)             
              Ooh!              

192
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,116
     - When's the last time     
     you had a brain scan?      

193
00:07:07,185 --> 00:07:08,251
 Kid looks like a movie star--  

194
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,221
      one that gets killed      
       in the first act.        

195
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:13,790
 - They are definitely brothers 
      from another mother.      

196
00:07:13,859 --> 00:07:16,826
Mr. Brousseau, I have known Joe 
       for over 20 years,       

197
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:19,629
and trust me, it will take more 
  than a prayer to Saint Jude   

198
00:07:19,698 --> 00:07:21,464
 to get the 10 bucks from him.  

199
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:23,266
    It will take a miracle.     

200
00:07:23,335 --> 00:07:25,836
      See, I can bust ba--      

201
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:28,538
          excuse me--           
           chops too.           

202
00:07:30,342 --> 00:07:32,175
   - I was fired from my job.   

203
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:34,144
    - You're in jeopardy now    
    of having the second car    

204
00:07:34,213 --> 00:07:36,179
  forfeited to a tow company.   

205
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:38,315
        - They asked me         
  if they could take the car.   

206
00:07:38,384 --> 00:07:40,250
        I told them no,         
          so I believe          

207
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,252
          they did it           
     without my permission.     

208
00:07:49,961 --> 00:07:52,196

00:07:54,967 --> 00:07:56,767

00:08:01,841 --> 00:08:02,706
           What pain?

227
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,495
       on Service Road 8        
        and Broadway...         

228
00:10:02,564 --> 00:10:04,297
         on July 15th.          

229
00:10:04,366 --> 00:10:07,967
   Let's take a look at this.   
        Light is yellow.        

230
00:10:08,036 --> 00:10:11,905
           It's red.            
    And you almost made it.     

231
00:10:11,973 --> 00:10:14,507
             (man)              
     Red, Your Honor, now.      
      Here's her vehicle.       

232
00:10:14,576 --> 00:10:17,110
         (Judge Caprio)         
   See where your vehicle is?   
 And the light just turned red. 

233
00:10:17,179 --> 00:10:19,112
        - First of all,         
    I'd like to let you know    

234
00:10:19,181 --> 00:10:21,047
    that I'm on disability.     

235
00:10:21,116 --> 00:10:22,115
         Second of all,         

236
00:10:22,184 --> 00:10:25,352
         I had my niece         
      and my nephew over,       

237
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,887
 and I believe they took my car 

238
00:10:27,956 --> 00:10:31,691
     because I haven't had      
  any violations on my license  

239
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,995
        in at least five        
        to seven years.         

240
00:10:35,063 --> 00:10:38,031
        So they asked me        
  if they could take the car.   

241
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,534
        I told them no,         
    so I believe they did it    

242
00:10:40,602 --> 00:10:42,869
     without my permission.     

243
00:10:42,938 --> 00:10:45,339
         And I believe          
       that he's the one        

244
00:10:45,407 --> 00:10:49,543
     'cause I don't recall      
  going through no red light.   

245
00:10:49,612 --> 00:10:53,781
    - This was at, uh, like,    
      5:00 in the evening.      

246
00:10:53,849 --> 00:10:56,116
       Would that be you?       
        - Yeah, I-- no.         

247
00:10:56,185 --> 00:10:59,286
   I don't believe it was me.   
I believe the kids took the car.

248
00:10:59,355 --> 00:11:01,822
        I call them kids        
'cause they're younger than me. 

249
00:11:01,891 --> 00:11:04,191
            - Yeah.             
           (laughing)           

250
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,795
          - But, uh...          
           But, uh...           

251
00:11:07,864 --> 00:11:09,330
    - You also have a ticket    
          for parking           

252
00:11:09,398 --> 00:11:11,699
       in a loading zone        
        on Union Street.        

253
00:11:11,768 --> 00:11:13,634
       I'm gonna dismiss        
    the loading zone ticket.    

254
00:11:13,703 --> 00:11:15,903
    - Thank you, Your Honor.    

255
00:11:15,972 --> 00:11:17,905
 - But when your name came up,  
they picked put his old ticket. 

256
00:11:17,974 --> 00:11:20,775
     I'm gonna dismiss it.      
    - Oh, thank you so much.    

257
00:11:20,843 --> 00:11:22,777
    - All right, now we have    
    to get back to the big--    

258
00:11:22,845 --> 00:11:24,378
         big guns here.         

259
00:11:24,447 --> 00:11:26,914
This red light violation, okay? 

260
00:11:26,983 --> 00:11:29,250
   I believe you, all right?    

261
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:30,384
 But here's what I'm gonna do.  

262
00:11:30,453 --> 00:11:33,054
    I'm gonna charge you $35    
          court costs,          

263
00:11:33,123 --> 00:11:34,822
     and get it from them.      

264
00:11:34,891 --> 00:11:37,325
          You hear me?          
             - Yes.             

265
00:11:37,394 --> 00:11:41,863
  - 'Cause you are responsible  
if someone who drives your car--

266
00:11:41,932 --> 00:11:44,499
         - Your Honor,          
    I can't afford it really    

267
00:11:44,568 --> 00:11:47,469
   because I'm on disability.   

268
00:11:47,537 --> 00:11:52,140
        And I only have,        
         uh, 75¢ on me          

269
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:54,442
 until my check comes the 1st.  

270
00:11:54,511 --> 00:11:56,011
    I don't have any money.     

271
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,714
          And then I--          
        I bought my car,        

272
00:11:59,783 --> 00:12:02,884
          and, uh, I--          

273
00:12:02,953 --> 00:12:05,353
   - Lisa, Lisa, Lisa, Lisa.    

274
00:12:07,991 --> 00:12:09,224
              I--               

275
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:12,995
       I'm dismissing it.       

276
00:12:13,063 --> 00:12:14,563
      - Oh, God bless you.      

277
00:12:14,632 --> 00:12:16,265
     Thank you, Your Honor.     

278
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:17,733
        - And good luck.        

279
00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:20,769
 - I really, really appreciate  

280
00:12:20,838 --> 00:12:24,807
       letting me be able       
  to not have to pay the fine   

281
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,910
          because I...          
    I don't have the means.     

282
00:12:27,978 --> 00:12:30,612
    - All right, it's okay.     

283
00:12:30,681 --> 00:12:32,514
       - I'm struggling.        

284
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:35,384
     And I'm trying to get      
     my condition together      

285
00:12:35,453 --> 00:12:37,953
   with my disability, so...    

286
00:12:38,022 --> 00:12:40,689
  - (Judge Caprio) Good luck.   
    - ...I'm trying my best.    

287
00:12:40,758 --> 00:12:42,324
         (Judge Caprio)         
       Good luck to you.        

288
00:12:42,393 --> 00:12:44,026
   - Thank you so much again.   

289
00:12:44,095 --> 00:12:45,861
           - Bye-bye.           
      - Have a great day.       

290

               ♪♪               

291
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,537
       - Patricia Lovely.       

292
00:12:54,606 --> 00:12:56,506
           - Morning.           
      - Morning, Patricia.      

293
00:12:57,809 --> 00:13:00,276
          You have two          
      red light violations      

294
00:13:00,345 --> 00:13:02,345
   and three parking tickets.   

295
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:03,646
          - I thought           
        I was coming in         

296
00:13:03,715 --> 00:13:06,049
because I hadn't gotten a ticket
           in so long           

297
00:13:06,117 --> 00:13:08,651
 and I was going to talk to you 
  about the good driver thing,  

298
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,054
           and then--           
            - Yeah.             

299
00:13:11,122 --> 00:13:12,655
          - I-- then--          

300
00:13:12,724 --> 00:13:14,257
   - You got two red lights.    
           - I know.            

301
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:16,326
    - I'm gonna dismiss one.    
   - Okay, thank you so much.   

302
00:13:16,394 --> 00:13:17,694
          - All right,          
      now what do you want      

303
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:18,962
        to tell me about        
      the parking tickets?      

304
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,264
  - Just that, you know, I-I--  

305
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,833
 It was right when they started 
 doing that thing where they--  

306
00:13:23,902 --> 00:13:26,303
     you had a parking spot     
        and you had pay         

307
00:13:26,371 --> 00:13:30,040
   down the street somewhere,   
       and I had no idea        
        how to do that.         

308
00:13:30,108 --> 00:13:32,309
  - Oh, the multi-spacace meter.
            - Yeah.             

309
00:13:32,377 --> 00:13:35,445
But I did do it, and I know that
        that was this--         

310
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,481
        it was back then        
  when they started doing that  

311
00:13:37,549 --> 00:13:39,816
   and I didn't know anything   
        about all that.         

312
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:41,518
      - Well, they got 'em      
 at three different locations.  

313
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:42,919
     It's not one location.     
       - I know, I know.        

314
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:46,089
          No, I know.           
     I'm bad-- it's my bad.     

315
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,859
   I'm just really happy to--   
    I wanna clear my slate.     

316
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:50,460
  - Are you ready to confess?   
            - I am.             

317
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:52,229
I feel like this is confession. 

318
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,665
       - Inspector Quinn,       
     we have a confession.      

319
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:57,901
          - (laughing)          

320
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,037
 Your Honor, it's been a while  
 since I've been to confession, 

321
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:01,805
           so, uh...            
      - (Judge Caprio) Oh.      

322
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:04,708
            (Quinn)             
 ...I can't fault the motorist. 

323
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:05,843
- Well, while you're confessing,

324
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:08,312
        we have a number        
  of unsolved crimes upstairs.  

325
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:09,613
      Do you wanna confess      
        to any of those?        

326
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,116
  We could clear them all out.  
            - Okay.             

327
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,417
      - What do you think,      
        Inspector Quinn?        

328
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:15,086
     - That-- I will accept     
        that confession,        

329
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:16,854
   Your Honor, all day long,    
       to clear the desk.       

330
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:19,223
- All right, I'm gonna fine you 
 $85 for one of the red lights  

331
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:21,325
        and $30 for one         
    of the parking tickets.     

332
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:23,928
      - I appreciate that.      
 - So it's gonna cost you $115. 

333
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:25,663
       - Okay, thank you        
     very, very much, sir.      

334
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,498
      - Good luck to you.       
            - Okay.             

335
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:29,200
     - I know you can't be      
         his girlfriend         

336
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:31,002
       because basketball       
       is his girlfriend.       

337
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,037
 If I was standing next to you, 
 I wouldn't wear that T-shirt.  

338
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:34,305
          - Thank you.          

339
00:16:52,414 --> 00:16:54,081
        - Donna Morales.        

340
00:16:56,885 --> 00:16:58,852
      Good morning, Donna.      
        - Good morning.         

341
00:16:58,921 --> 00:17:02,856
       - Donna, your car        
       was, uh... towed.        

342
00:17:04,493 --> 00:17:06,827
      It was booted first.      
        It wasn't paid.         

343
00:17:06,896 --> 00:17:09,630
   As a result, it got towed.   

344
00:17:09,698 --> 00:17:12,199
           - Correct.           
     - The car got towed...     

345
00:17:12,268 --> 00:17:13,801
          last month?           

346
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:15,836
             - Yes.             

347
00:17:19,876 --> 00:17:23,277
 - Why did it take you a month  
    to come in here on this?    

348
00:17:23,346 --> 00:17:25,012
      - Well, Your Honor,       
          I just, uh--          

349
00:17:25,081 --> 00:17:28,249
    I was fired from my job.    
      I didn't have a job.      

350
00:17:28,317 --> 00:17:29,350
              Um--              
             - No.              

351
00:17:29,419 --> 00:17:31,152
 Well, let me go through this.  

352
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,522
     Your car was booted...     
        two months ago?         

353
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:38,125
 - No, that's, um, the Nissan.  

354
00:17:38,194 --> 00:17:42,930
       I have my Infinity       
that was just booted last week. 

355
00:17:42,999 --> 00:17:44,866
        - Wait a minute.        
         Wait a minute.         

356
00:17:44,934 --> 00:17:47,802
  There are two vehicles here?  
   - Yes, two vehicles, but--   

357
00:17:47,871 --> 00:17:50,805
- Let me go through this slowly.
           (chuckles)           

358
00:17:50,874 --> 00:17:52,840
 The first vehicle is a Nissan. 

359
00:17:52,909 --> 00:17:55,810
     I'm just-- I just know     
     what I have before me.     

360
00:17:55,879 --> 00:17:57,612
           - Correct.           
   - It appears that that car   

361
00:17:57,681 --> 00:17:59,814
      was blooted-- booted      
    a couple of months ago.     

362
00:17:59,883 --> 00:18:01,649
           - Correct.           
       - And then towed.        

363
00:18:01,718 --> 00:18:03,485
           - Correct.           
- It's still at the tow company?

364
00:18:03,553 --> 00:18:04,752
           - Correct.           

365
00:18:04,821 --> 00:18:06,020
         - Are you here         
       for that vehicle?        

366
00:18:06,089 --> 00:18:08,456
         - No, I'm not.         
       Unfortunately, I--       

367
00:18:08,525 --> 00:18:11,059
  The reason why it got towed   
     and I didn't come in--     

368
00:18:11,128 --> 00:18:13,361
  I was not able to register.   

369
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,397
      I was in the process      
        of registering.         

370
00:18:15,465 --> 00:18:19,167
   I bought it from a dealer    
      off of the Internet.      

371
00:18:19,236 --> 00:18:23,872
    And something was wrong     
     with the title that--      

372
00:18:23,941 --> 00:18:26,475
       so it looked like        
  three people were on there.   

373
00:18:26,543 --> 00:18:30,011
I was dealing with Miss Mancini 
         from the DMV.          

374
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,914
    She said, unfortunately,    
 we couldn't get it registered. 

375
00:18:32,983 --> 00:18:34,449
    - Oh, you bought a car.     
            To use--            

376
00:18:34,518 --> 00:18:37,486
  To use the street language,   
  the car was a gaffe, right?   

377
00:18:37,554 --> 00:18:39,154
       - Basically, yes.        
             And--              

378
00:18:39,223 --> 00:18:41,623
        - So, all right.        
They had trouble with the title.

379
00:18:41,692 --> 00:18:43,759
     You bought it online.      
  You couldn't get it cleared.  

380
00:18:43,827 --> 00:18:45,661
           All right,           
     I understand all that.     

381
00:18:45,729 --> 00:18:47,496
   So you forfeited that car.   
            - Right.            

382
00:18:47,565 --> 00:18:50,432
 - The tow guys got it, right?  
- Right, so that's why I didn't.

383
00:18:50,501 --> 00:18:52,534
    - So you said, "Keep it.    
    I don't care about it."     

384
00:18:52,603 --> 00:18:55,804
  - 'Cause you can't-- the DMV  
   said I can't register it.    

385
00:18:55,873 --> 00:18:58,707
   - And... on the Infinity,    

386
00:18:58,776 --> 00:19:02,044
      you had 11 tickets.       

387
00:19:02,113 --> 00:19:04,880
    None of which were paid.    

388
00:19:04,949 --> 00:19:08,317
       Most of them were        
       overnight parking        
      outside your house.       

389
00:19:08,386 --> 00:19:10,319
       - Yes, Your Honor.       
       My landlord, uh--        

390
00:19:10,388 --> 00:19:13,889
 I tried to file for the, um--  
      to see if I can get       

391
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:16,525
 the overnight parking ticket,  
        but because we--        

392
00:19:16,594 --> 00:19:18,728
     there's six apartments     
          in my house,          

393
00:19:18,796 --> 00:19:22,565
  the landlord had to go down   
  and do something, they said.  

394
00:19:22,634 --> 00:19:25,268
  He finally just did it now.   

395
00:19:25,336 --> 00:19:28,137
       And I lost my job.       
  That's why I didn't come in.  

396
00:19:28,206 --> 00:19:30,640
     I'm just back to work,     
     so now I can take care     

397
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:34,610
     of the parking tickets     
        and everything.         

398
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:36,112
    I'm not here to give you    
           an excuse.           

399
00:19:36,181 --> 00:19:38,715
  I'm fully responsible for it  
      and willing to pay.       

400
00:19:38,783 --> 00:19:41,818
      - All right, Donna,       
     you're in jeopardy now     

401
00:19:41,886 --> 00:19:46,155
 of having the second car towed 
and forfeited to a tow company. 

402
00:19:46,224 --> 00:19:47,423
           - Correct.           

403
00:19:47,492 --> 00:19:49,959
 - So what do you wanna tell me 
          about these?          

404
00:19:50,028 --> 00:19:51,728
          Did you come          
      prepared today to--       

405
00:19:51,796 --> 00:19:55,031
    prepared to pay-- to pay    
  for the boot to be released?  

406
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:59,035
    - I have right now $300,    
  Your Honor, that I can give,  

407
00:19:59,104 --> 00:20:01,538
   and then I could come back   
           every week           

408
00:20:01,606 --> 00:20:03,940
       and make a payment       
     towards them tickets--     

409
00:20:04,009 --> 00:20:05,909
   - Your record hasn't been    
           that good.           

410
00:20:05,978 --> 00:20:07,344
         You know that?         
       - I know, I know.        

411
00:20:07,412 --> 00:20:08,812
       - But you changed.       

412
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,414
     - I-I have a good job.     
         I lost my job.         

413
00:20:11,483 --> 00:20:14,751
  I got a-- I'm back to work.   
       I am not losing--        

414
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,453
   I'm not gonna lose my job.   

415
00:20:16,522 --> 00:20:18,488
    I have no other choice.     

416
00:20:18,557 --> 00:20:20,290
             But...             
           (laughing)           

417
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:22,993
      But I will be making      
   the payments, Your Honor.    

418
00:20:23,062 --> 00:20:25,495
      - In your defense...      

419
00:20:25,564 --> 00:20:27,531
       In your defense...       

420
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:30,067
 'cause I really wanna be fair  
        with you, okay?         

421
00:20:32,538 --> 00:20:35,505
  Almost all of these tickets   

422
00:20:35,574 --> 00:20:40,077
      are parking in front      
    of your house overnight.    

423
00:20:40,146 --> 00:20:43,714
And I have some sympathy for you
        because of that.        

424
00:20:43,783 --> 00:20:46,383
  'Cause we have an ordinance   
         in Providence          

425
00:20:46,452 --> 00:20:49,987
 that you cannot park overnight 
 on the streets in Providence.  

426
00:20:50,056 --> 00:20:52,756
     And I know that many--     
         many landlords         

427
00:20:52,825 --> 00:20:56,527
  don't have sufficient number  
       of parking spaces        

428
00:20:56,596 --> 00:20:59,029
       for their tenants        
 and the tenants have no choice 

429
00:20:59,098 --> 00:21:01,532
   but to park on the street.   

430
00:21:01,601 --> 00:21:05,302
All right, the original tickets 
           are $835.            

431
00:21:05,371 --> 00:21:08,572
     The original tickets.      

432
00:21:08,641 --> 00:21:11,108
  All right, I'm gonna dismiss  
    a number of the tickets     

433
00:21:11,177 --> 00:21:12,843
     on Monticello Street.      

434
00:21:12,912 --> 00:21:16,414
      It's gonna cost you       
        a $100 boot fee,        

435
00:21:16,482 --> 00:21:20,217
     $300 for the tickets,      
 and I'm gonna release the boot 

436
00:21:20,286 --> 00:21:23,554
  as soon as you pay the 300,   
   which will be today, okay?   

437
00:21:23,623 --> 00:21:25,990
            - Okay.             
   - You have a $100 balance.   

438
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:27,859
       You're gonna have        
        a $100 balance.         

439
00:21:27,927 --> 00:21:29,293
            - Okay.             

440
00:21:29,362 --> 00:21:31,162
       - Try to pay that        
      as quick as possible      

441
00:21:31,231 --> 00:21:33,498
      so that you can buy       
         a parking pass         

442
00:21:33,566 --> 00:21:36,367
so you can park the car in front
   of your house for a year.    

443
00:21:36,436 --> 00:21:38,569
  Okay, so as soon as you pay   
         the other 100,         

444
00:21:38,638 --> 00:21:41,205
       you'll be eligible       
     to buy a parking pass.     

445
00:21:41,274 --> 00:21:43,608
     - Okay, I can pay that     
    next Friday, Your Honor.    

446
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:46,577
       Thank you so much.       
          - Good luck.          

447
00:21:46,646 --> 00:21:48,513
          - Thank you.          
    - I'm trying to help you    

448
00:21:48,582 --> 00:21:51,049
       to help yourself,        
   so, please, help yourself.   

449
00:21:51,117 --> 00:21:52,283
      - I definitely will.      

450
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:55,186
I definitely will be here Friday
       to pay that $100.        

451
00:21:55,255 --> 00:21:57,355
   - Okay, good luck to you.    
      - Thank you so much.      

452
00:21:57,424 --> 00:21:58,857
          - Good luck.          
          - Thank you.          

453
00:25:04,446 --> 00:25:05,879
      - Rayelle Fernandez.      

454
