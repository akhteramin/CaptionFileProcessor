944
00:26:58,483 --> 00:26:59,916

SO IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE.        

945
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:02,485
SO IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE.        
AND LET'S NOT FORGET, A COUPLE

00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:05,822
AND LET'S NOT FORGET, A COUPLE  
WEEKS AGO HE ADDRESSED THE

WEEKS AGO HE ADDRESSED THE      
COUNTRY IN DIPLOMATIC RECEPTION 

948
00:27:07,825 --> 00:27:09,625
COUNTRY IN DIPLOMATIC RECEPTION 
ROOM WHERE HE TALKED ABOUT      

949
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:10,393
ROOM WHERE HE TALKED ABOUT      
IMMIGRATION, AND THAT WAS FILLED

950
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:10,927
IMMIGRATION, AND THAT WAS FILLED
WITH DIVISION.                  

951
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:12,662
WITH DIVISION.                  
AND THEN HE DID IT WEEKS PRIOR  

952
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:14,263
AND THEN HE DID IT WEEKS PRIOR  
THE THAT IN THE OVAL OFFICE     

953
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:16,165
THE THAT IN THE OVAL OFFICE     
BEHIND THE RESOLUTE DESK.       

954
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:17,800
BEHIND THE RESOLUTE DESK.       
THAT WAS FILLED WITH DIVISION   

955
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:18,167
THAT WAS FILLED WITH DIVISION   
AND HATE.                       

956
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:20,069
AND HATE.                       
SO I JUST DON'T SEE HOW THAT'S  

957
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:20,970
SO I JUST DON'T SEE HOW THAT'S  
POSSIBLE COMING FROM THIS

THERE'S PART OF IT THAT IS THE  

982
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,839
THERE'S PART OF IT THAT IS THE  
ART OF PERSUASION, WHICH IS TO  

983
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,207
ART OF PERSUASION, WHICH IS TO  
TALK ABOUT IT AND TO USE THE

THING, AND WHAT DID WE SEE?     

1028
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:04,473
THING, AND WHAT DID WE SEE?     
WE HEARD ABOUT CHARLOTTESVILLE.

1036
00:29:11,749 --> 00:29:14,483
THINK?                          
>> I THINK THAT UNITY DOES NOT  

1037
00:29:14,485 --> 00:29:15,518
>> I THINK THAT UNITY DOES NOT  
MEAN AGREEMENT ON EVERYTHING.   

1038
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,453
MEAN AGREEMENT ON EVERYTHING.   
AND THAT'S OKAY.                

1039
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:19,121
AND THAT'S OKAY.                
THAT'S WHAT POLITICS IS FOR.

I THINK WHAT UNITY MEANS IS NOT 

1041
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:24,794
I THINK WHAT UNITY MEANS IS NOT 
THAT DONALD TRUMP SAYS TO       

1042
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:25,928
THAT DONALD TRUMP SAYS TO       
SPEAKER PELOSI, WHATEVER YOU    

1043
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:26,495
SPEAKER PELOSI, WHATEVER YOU    
WANT, THAT'S FINE.              

1044
00:29:26,497 --> 00:29:28,264
WANT, THAT'S FINE.              
I THINK WHAT IT MEANS IS HOW DO 

1045
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:31,934
I THINK WHAT IT MEANS IS HOW DO 
WE IDENTIFY THE PROBLEMS THE

00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,006
TOGETHER, AND WE CAN DISAGREE ON
OTHER THINGS, BUT LET'S DO THAT 

1049
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:39,208
OTHER THINGS, BUT LET'S DO THAT 
IN A WAY WHERE WE AT LEAST SET

00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,277
IN A WAY WHERE WE AT LEAST SET  
THE TABLE ON COMMON GOALS.

SO YOU THINK ABOUT THE          

1100
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:51,947
SO YOU THINK ABOUT THE

I THINK WHAT THE PRESIDENT NEEDS

1107
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:04,627
I THINK WHAT THE PRESIDENT NEEDS
TO DO IS EXPLAIN WHY THAT'S     

1108
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:06,161
TO DO IS EXPLAIN WHY THAT'S     
IMPORTANT AND HOW THAT IS       

1109
00:31:06,163 --> 00:31:07,529
IMPORTANT AND HOW THAT IS       
SOMETHING THAT PROTECTS, HOW    

1110
00:31:07,531 --> 00:31:09,365
SOMETHING THAT PROTECTS, HOW    
BORDER SECURITY PROTECTS WORKING

1111
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:09,865
BORDER SECURITY PROTECTS WORKING
FAMILIES.

WHY?                            

1114
00:31:11,702 --> 00:31:13,202
WHY?                            
BECAUSE IT PROTECTS THEIR MOST  

1115
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:16,605
BECAUSE IT PROTECTS THEIR MOST  
VALUABLE ASSET, WHICH IS THEIR  

1116
00:31:16,607 --> 00:31:17,206
VALUABLE ASSET, WHICH IS THEIR

BECOMING A SOURCE OF            
EMBARRASSMENT.                  

1866
00:52:32,848 --> 00:52:34,381
EMBARRASSMENT.                  
AND SO WALKING AWAY FROM $50    

1867
00:52:34,383 --> 00:52:35,081
AND SO WALKING AWAY FROM $50    
MILLION WAS PRETTY HEROIC AND   

1868
00:52:35,083 --> 00:52:37,250
MILLION WAS PRETTY HEROIC AND   
PRETTY DECENT AND FULL OF       

1869
00:52:37,252 --> 00:52:38,118
PRETTY DECENT AND FULL OF       
INTEGRITY.                      

1870
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:38,852
INTEGRITY.                      
WELL, YOU KNOW, I COULDN'T READ 

1871
00:52:38,854 --> 00:52:40,520
WELL, YOU KNOW, I COULDN'T READ 
UNTIL I WAS 12.                 

1872
00:52:40,522 --> 00:52:41,888
UNTIL I WAS 12.                 
AND MAYBE I WASN'T 12, BUT I WAS

1873
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:42,489
AND MAYBE I WASN'T 12, BUT I WAS
OLDER.                          

1874
00:52:42,491 --> 00:52:44,291
OLDER.                          
I THINK PEOPLE START READING    

1875
00:52:44,293 --> 00:52:46,493
I THINK PEOPLE START READING    
WHEN THEY'RE FIVE OR SOMETHING. 

1876
00:52:46,495 --> 00:52:49,062
WHEN THEY'RE FIVE OR SOMETHING. 
AND SO BOOKS WERE KIND OF THIS  

1877
00:52:49,064 --> 00:52:49,963
AND SO BOOKS WERE KIND OF THIS  
PHANTASMAGORICAL SPACE THAT I   

1878
00:52:49,965 --> 00:52:50,664
PHANTASMAGORICAL SPACE THAT I   
COULDN'T ENTER BECAUSE MY MOM   

1879
00:52:50,666 --> 00:52:52,032
COULDN'T ENTER BECAUSE MY MOM   
COULD READ.                     

1880
00:52:52,034 --> 00:52:52,632
COULD READ.                     
MY DAD WAS AN ACADEMIC.         

1881
00:52:52,634 --> 00:52:54,501
MY DAD WAS AN ACADEMIC.         
EVERYONE WAS SO INTELLIGENT.    

1882
00:52:54,503 --> 00:52:56,603
EVERYONE WAS SO INTELLIGENT.    
AND I COULDN'T GO THERE.        

1883
00:52:56,605 --> 00:52:58,505
AND I COULDN'T GO THERE.        
AND THE MOMENT I COULD, I JUST  

1884
00:52:58,507 --> 00:53:00,640
AND THE MOMENT I COULD, I JUST  
STARTED TO READ RAVENOUSLY.     

1885
00:53:00,642 --> 00:53:02,142
STARTED TO READ RAVENOUSLY.     
ONE OF THE BOOKS THAT I REMEMBER

1886
00:53:02,144 --> 00:53:02,842
ONE OF THE BOOKS THAT I REMEMBER
CHANGING EVERYONE'S LIVES WAS   

1887
00:53:02,844 --> 00:53:04,544
CHANGING EVERYONE'S LIVES WAS   
"BELOVED."                      

1888
00:53:04,546 --> 00:53:08,448
"BELOVED."                      
THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME PEOPLE  

1889
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:10,483
THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME PEOPLE  
WHO HAD BEEN SILENCED, ENSLAVED 

1890
00:53:10,485 --> 00:53:13,186
WHO HAD BEEN SILENCED, ENSLAVED 
PEOPLE, BECAME HUMAN.           

1891
00:53:13,188 --> 00:53:14,487
PEOPLE, BECAME HUMAN.           
AND, AT THAT MOMENT, I SAID,    

1892
00:53:14,489 --> 00:53:16,523
AND, AT THAT MOMENT, I SAID,    
THIS IS WHAT A WRITER CAN DO.   

1893
00:53:16,525 --> 00:53:18,491
THIS IS WHAT A WRITER CAN DO.   
AND, SO, FOR ME, TONI MORRISON  

1894
00:53:18,493 --> 00:53:21,361
AND, SO, FOR ME, TONI MORRISON  
DOESN'T EXIST ON A HUMAN PLANE. 

1895
00:53:21,363 --> 00:53:22,429
DOESN'T EXIST ON A HUMAN PLANE. 
SHE ALMOST EXISTS IN THIS ODD,  

1896
00:53:22,431 --> 00:53:25,699
SHE ALMOST EXISTS IN THIS ODD,  
SPIRITUAL, OTHERWORLD, IN TERMS 

1897
00:53:25,701 --> 00:53:26,499
SPIRITUAL, OTHERWORLD, IN TERMS 
OF HER WORK.                    

1898
00:53:26,501 --> 00:53:28,535
OF HER WORK.                    
AND WHEN SHE WON THAT NOBEL     

1899
00:53:28,537 --> 00:53:30,503
AND WHEN SHE WON THAT NOBEL     
PRIZE, WHAT WAS INTERESTING IS  

1900
00:53:30,505 --> 00:53:33,039
PRIZE, WHAT WAS INTERESTING IS  
THAT A LOT OF PROMINENT         

1901
00:53:33,041 --> 00:53:34,474
THAT A LOT OF PROMINENT         
NEWSPAPERS ASKED, DOES THIS     

1902
00:53:34,476 --> 00:53:36,142
NEWSPAPERS ASKED, DOES THIS
