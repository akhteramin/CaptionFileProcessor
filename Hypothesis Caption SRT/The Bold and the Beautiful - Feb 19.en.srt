Should I refresh your memory?   
The way you pursued Steffy,     
the way you bribed me into      

188
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:35,293
The way you pursued Steffy,     
the way you bribed me into      
getting Liam to believe that you

189
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:36,828
the way you bribed me into      
getting Liam to believe that you
two were still together, is that

190
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,162
getting Liam to believe that you
two were still together, is that
it?                             

191
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:38,597
two were still together, is that
it?                             
>> Bill: I don't want to think  

192
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:39,831
it?                             
>> Bill: I don't want to think  
about any of that, Wyatt.       

193
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,299
>> Bill: I don't want to think  
about any of that, Wyatt.       
>> Wyatt: It was your son's own 

194
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:43,835
about any of that, Wyatt.       
>> Wyatt: It was your son's own 
pregnant wife, Dad!             

195
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:46,037
>> Wyatt: It was your son's own 
pregnant wife, Dad!             
Who -- Who does that?           

196
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:59,217
>> Bill: I do.                  
I did.                          
I screwed up, big-time, and I   

197
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:02,454
I did.                          
I screwed up, big-time, and I   
will do whatever I have to to   

198
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:05,757
I screwed up, big-time, and I   
will do whatever I have to to   
repair it, to make this family  

199
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,792
will do whatever I have to to   
repair it, to make this family  
right.                          

200
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:10,629
repair it, to make this family  
right.                          
I used to preach "Family first."

201
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:14,366
right.                          
I used to preach "Family first."
I lived that, until I turned my 

202
00:07:14,368 --> 00:07:17,369
I used to preach "Family first."
I lived that, until I turned my 
back on everyone.               

203
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:19,438
I lived that, until I turned my 
back on everyone.               
But we can get it back, Wyatt.  

204
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,173
back on everyone.               
But we can get it back, Wyatt.  
We can have this family again.  

205
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:22,808
But we can get it back, Wyatt.  
We can have this family again.  
I mean, look at my relationship 

206
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:23,975
We can have this family again.  
I mean, look at my relationship 
with Will, all right?           

207
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:25,377
I mean, look at my relationship 
with Will, all right?           
I've already proved it.         

208
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:26,812
with Will, all right?           
I've already proved it.         
I've stepped up for him.        

209
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:28,547
I've already proved it.         
I've stepped up for him.        
I'm gonna step up for you.      

210
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:29,915
I've stepped up for him.        
I'm gonna step up for you.      
That's what I want.             

211
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:31,283
I'm gonna step up for you.      
That's what I want.             
I want to be the kind of man    

212
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:32,851
That's what I want.             
I want to be the kind of man    
that you need me to be, the kind

213
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:34,252
I want to be the kind of man    
that you need me to be, the kind
of father that you need me to   

214
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:37,022
that you need me to be, the kind
of father that you need me to   
be.                             

215
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:40,559
of father that you need me to   
be.                             
Come back to Spencer.           

216
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:45,464
be.                             
Come back to Spencer.           
This is where you belong.       

217
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:48,967
>> Reese: Okay, okay.           
I brought you into this.        
I will testify to that if the   

218
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,001
I brought you into this.        
I will testify to that if the   
time comes, all right?          

219
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:51,236
I will testify to that if the   
time comes, all right?          
You were -- You were driving    

220
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:52,404
time comes, all right?          
You were -- You were driving    
into Los Angeles to help a      

221
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:52,904
You were -- You were driving    
into Los Angeles to help a      
friend.                         

222
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:54,139
into Los Angeles to help a      
friend.                         
You didn't know what you were   

223
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,040
friend.                         
You didn't know what you were   
being dragged into.             

224
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:57,409
You didn't know what you were   
being dragged into.             
You don't know the birth mother.

225
00:07:57,411 --> 00:07:58,710
being dragged into.             
You don't know the birth mother.
>> Hope.                        

226
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:00,779
You don't know the birth mother.
>> Hope.                        
You said her name was Hope.     

227
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:01,880
>> Hope.                        
You said her name was Hope.     
I know I don't know her,        

228
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:03,181
You said her name was Hope.     
I know I don't know her,        
but I feel like I do            

229
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:05,050
I know I don't know her,        
but I feel like I do            
I can picture her -- her guilt, 

230
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:06,985
but I feel like I do            
I can picture her -- her guilt, 
her confusion about all of this,

231
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,086
I can picture her -- her guilt, 
her confusion about all of this,
and we did that.                

232
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:10,422
her confusion about all of this,
and we did that.                
We caused her that pain.        

233
00:08:10,424 --> 00:08:11,456
and we did that.                
We caused her that pain.        
She's a total stranger.         

234
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,791
We caused her that pain.        
She's a total stranger.         
I don't know anything about her.

235
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:14,092
She's a total stranger.         
I don't know anything about her.
I should just be able to forget 

236
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:14,893
I don't know anything about her.
I should just be able to forget 
her, but I can't.               

237
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,995
I should just be able to forget 
her, but I can't.               
I feel this -- this guilt,      

238
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:20,098
her, but I can't.               
I feel this -- this guilt,      
this tremendous guilt.          

239
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,434
I feel this -- this guilt,      
this tremendous guilt.          
about what we did to her.       

240
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:29,407
>> Brooke: I think I understand.
I'm trying to, at least.        
>> Hope: It's okay if you don't.

241
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:30,575
I'm trying to, at least.        
>> Hope: It's okay if you don't.
I mean, honestly, I can't fully 

242
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:31,443
>> Hope: It's okay if you don't.
I mean, honestly, I can't fully 
comprehend it, either.          

243
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:33,912
I mean, honestly, I can't fully 
comprehend it, either.          
All I know is that when I hold  

244
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:36,448
comprehend it, either.          
All I know is that when I hold  
Phoebe, something inside of me, 

245
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,549
All I know is that when I hold  
Phoebe, something inside of me, 
it just...                      

246
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:39,818
Phoebe, something inside of me, 
it just...                      
feels right, you know?          

247
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,620
it just...                      
feels right, you know?          
I feel complete.                

248
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:43,488
feels right, you know?          
I feel complete.                
>> Brooke: She really does bring

249
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,890
I feel complete.                
>> Brooke: She really does bring
you peace, doesn't she?         

250
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:45,824
>> Brooke: She really does bring
you peace, doesn't she?         
>> Hope: Yeah.                  

251
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:48,793
you peace, doesn't she?         
>> Hope: Yeah.                  
Yeah, and I know it might sound 

252
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:51,930
>> Hope: Yeah.                  
Yeah, and I know it might sound 
a bit...                        

253
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:54,132
Yeah, and I know it might sound 
a bit...                        
but I really believe that Phoebe

254
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:55,767
a bit...                        
but I really believe that Phoebe
was here for a reason.          

255
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,302
but I really believe that Phoebe
was here for a reason.          
And not just for Steffy.        

256
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:58,937
was here for a reason.          
And not just for Steffy.        
And I know she is Steffy's      

257
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:00,906
And not just for Steffy.        
And I know she is Steffy's      
daughter and I respect that, but

258
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:02,807
And I know she is Steffy's      
daughter and I respect that, but
when I hold her and I look down 

259
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,743
daughter and I respect that, but
when I hold her and I look down 
at her...                       

260
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:09,447
when I hold her and I look down 
at her...                       
every part of me feels it,      

261
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:12,417
at her...                       
every part of me feels it,      
that Phoebe is here for me, too.

262
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:20,025
>> Steffy: I know, I know.      
You're hungry, sweet pea.       
There you go.                   

263
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:22,661
You're hungry, sweet pea.       
There you go.                   
Let's fill you up before Kelly  

264
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:24,162
There you go.                   
Let's fill you up before Kelly  
wakes up, okay?                 

265
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:25,764
Let's fill you up before Kelly  
wakes up, okay?                 
>> Xander: Is it difficult      

266
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:26,498
wakes up, okay?                 
>> Xander: Is it difficult      
juggling?                       

267
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,767
>> Xander: Is it difficult      
juggling?                       
>> Steffy: Yeah, yeah, it can   

268
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:31,102
juggling?                       
>> Steffy: Yeah, yeah, it can   
be, but I wouldn't have it any  

269
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:32,103
>> Steffy: Yeah, yeah, it can   
be, but I wouldn't have it any  
other way.                      

270
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:34,973
be, but I wouldn't have it any  
other way.                      
>> Zoe: So Phoebe fits right in 

271
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,509
other way.                      
>> Zoe: So Phoebe fits right in 
as if she was always yours.     

272
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:39,978
>> Zoe: So Phoebe fits right in 
as if she was always yours.     
>> Steffy: Yeah, always.        

273
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,746
as if she was always yours.     
>> Steffy: Yeah, always.        
It's like I have to remind      

274
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,682
>> Steffy: Yeah, always.        
It's like I have to remind      
myself I didn't carry Phoebe.   

275
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:47,052
It's like I have to remind      
myself I didn't carry Phoebe.   
I know it sounds ridiculous,    

276
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:48,186
myself I didn't carry Phoebe.   
I know it sounds ridiculous,    
but...                          

277
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:50,488
I know it sounds ridiculous,    
but...                          
That's how quickly we connected.

    Ok, let's huff and puff.    

309
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,417
 Like you do sometimes, Grandpa?

310
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:12,620
   Well, when you have COPD,    
   it can be hard to breathe.   

311
00:11:12,622 --> 00:11:13,922
      So my doctor said...      

312
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:15,623
       SYMBICORT can help       
       you breathe better-      

313
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,509
   starting within 5 minutes.   

314
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:19,928
  It doesn't replace a rescue   
  inhaler for sudden symptoms.  

315
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,180
     SYMBICORT helps provide    
     significant improvement    

316
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:22,881
     of your lung function.     

317
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,632
     SYMBICORT is for COPD,     

318
00:11:24,634 --> 00:11:26,751
  including chronic bronchitis  
         and emphysema.         

319
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:28,636
     It should not be taken     
     more than twice a day.     

320
00:11:28,638 --> 00:11:30,588
    It may increase your risk   
       of lung infections,      

321
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,857
       osteoporosis, and        
       some eye problems.       

322
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,559
     Tell your doctor if you    
     have a heart condition     

323
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:35,894
     or high blood pressure     
       before taking it.        

324
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:38,196
   SYMBICORT could mean a day   
     with better breathing.     

325
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,731
       Watch out, piggies!      

326
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:43,618
  Ask your doctor if SYMBICORT  
       is right for you.        

327
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,153
       If you can't afford

It would be different if we     
still had our own child to      

573
00:21:57,784 --> 00:21:58,816
It would be different if we     
still had our own child to      
raise, but...                   

574
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,584
still had our own child to      
raise, but...                   
>> Brooke: Your marriage wasn't 

575
00:22:00,586 --> 00:22:01,519
raise, but...                   
>> Brooke: Your marriage wasn't 
based on Beth.                  

576
00:22:01,521 --> 00:22:03,521
>> Brooke: Your marriage wasn't 
based on Beth.                  
You and Liam, you fell in love, 

577
00:22:03,523 --> 00:22:05,556
based on Beth.                  
You and Liam, you fell in love, 
you got married, and, yes, maybe

578
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:07,558
You and Liam, you fell in love, 
you got married, and, yes, maybe
Beth would have come along, but 

579
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,427
you got married, and, yes, maybe
Beth would have come along, but 
the core of the family, Hope,   

580
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:10,594
Beth would have come along, but 
the core of the family, Hope,   
is you and Liam.                

581
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:12,630
the core of the family, Hope,   
is you and Liam.                
And you need to focus on that.  

582
00:22:12,632 --> 00:22:14,598
is you and Liam.                
And you need to focus on that.  
You need to be there for each   

583
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,232
And you need to focus on that.  
You need to be there for each   
other.                          

584
00:22:15,234 --> 00:22:17,301
You need to be there for each   
other.                          
And stop pushing him away.      

585
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:19,403
other.                          
And stop pushing him away.      
>> Hope: I understand, but...   

586
00:22:19,405 --> 00:22:22,740
And stop pushing him away.      
>> Hope: I understand, but...   
>> Brooke: No. No "buts."       

587
00:22:22,742 --> 00:22:23,674
>> Hope: I understand, but...   
>> Brooke: No. No "buts."       
>> Hope: Why?                   

588
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,376
>> Brooke: No. No "buts."       
>> Hope: Why?                   
>> Brooke: Because he's your    

589
00:22:25,378 --> 00:22:27,144
>> Hope: Why?                   
>> Brooke: Because he's your    
husband, and you need to make   

590
00:22:27,146 --> 00:22:28,579
>> Brooke: Because he's your    
husband, and you need to make   
this relationship work.         

591
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:30,347
husband, and you need to make   
this relationship work.         
You have to be there for him.   

592
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:33,784
this relationship work.         
You have to be there for him.   
>> Hope: Why is Beth gone?      

593
00:22:33,786 --> 00:22:37,555
You have to be there for him.   
>> Hope: Why is Beth gone?      
Why did I have to lose my child?

594
00:22:37,557 --> 00:22:41,592
>> Hope: Why is Beth gone?      
Why did I have to lose my child?
It changed everything.          

595
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:44,295
>> Brooke: Oh, honey...         

596
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:58,709
>> Reese: I -- I thought you    
were headed straight to Hope.   
>> Zoe: Yeah, I almost did.     

597
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:01,378
were headed straight to Hope.   
>> Zoe: Yeah, I almost did.     
But I -- I decided to go to     

598
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,047
>> Zoe: Yeah, I almost did.     
But I -- I decided to go to     
Steffy instead.                 

599
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:05,316
But I -- I decided to go to     
Steffy instead.                 
>> Reese: Steffy?               

600
00:23:05,318 --> 00:23:07,551
Steffy instead.                 
>> Reese: Steffy?               
>> Zoe: I didn't know what I'd  

601
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,787
>> Reese: Steffy?               
>> Zoe: I didn't know what I'd  
even say to her, how the words  

602
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:11,889
>> Zoe: I didn't know what I'd  
even say to her, how the words  
would come out, if they even    

603
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:12,656
even say to her, how the words  
would come out, if they even    
should.                         

604
00:23:12,658 --> 00:23:15,159
would come out, if they even    
should.                         
But I just had this feeling to  

605
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:17,094
should.                         
But I just had this feeling to  
go see her, that baby.          

606
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:19,463
But I just had this feeling to  
go see her, that baby.          
Hope's baby.                    

607
00:23:19,465 --> 00:23:21,665
go see her, that baby.          
Hope's baby.                    
I still can't even believe that 

608
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:23,534
Hope's baby.                    
I still can't even believe that 
you would do something so       

609
00:23:23,536 --> 00:23:25,736
I still can't even believe that 
you would do something so       
horrible, telling Hope that her 

610
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:26,971
you would do something so       
horrible, telling Hope that her 
child had died.                 

611
00:23:26,973 --> 00:23:29,406
horrible, telling Hope that her 
child had died.                 
>> Reese: I would do anything to

612
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,641
child had died.                 
>> Reese: I would do anything to
keep you safe.                  

613
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:32,076
>> Reese: I would do anything to
keep you safe.                  
>> Zoe: Except for stop         

614
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:32,843
keep you safe.                  
>> Zoe: Except for stop         
gambling.                       

615
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:35,513
>> Zoe: Except for stop         
gambling.                       
>> Reese: I know you probably   

616
00:23:35,515 --> 00:23:38,182
gambling.                       
>> Reese: I know you probably   
can't forgive what I've done.   

617
00:23:38,184 --> 00:23:39,583
>> Reese: I know you probably   
can't forgive what I've done.   
It was awful.                   

618
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:41,785
can't forgive what I've done.   
It was awful.                   
>> Zoe: Most criminal acts are. 

619
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:43,087
It was awful.                   
>> Zoe: Most criminal acts are. 
>> Reese: I know you don't      

620
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:44,355
>> Zoe: Most criminal acts are. 
>> Reese: I know you don't      
believe it, but it's true.      

621
00:23:44,357 --> 00:23:47,458
>> Reese: I know you don't      
believe it, but it's true.      
How much I love you.            

622
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,827
believe it, but it's true.      
How much I love you.            
What I would do to protect you. 

623
00:23:49,829 --> 00:23:53,397
How much I love you.            
What I would do to protect you. 
>> Zoe: I believe that, which   

624
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:56,367
What I would do to protect you. 
>> Zoe: I believe that, which   
makes it so hard for me         

625
00:23:56,369 --> 00:23:59,203
>> Zoe: I believe that, which   
makes it so hard for me         
because the right thing is so   

626
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:00,304
makes it so hard for me         
because the right thing is so   
obvious.                        

627
00:24:00,306 --> 00:24:02,673
because the right thing is so   
obvious.                        
The right thing for me to do is 

628
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:04,742
obvious.                        
The right thing for me to do is 
to go running to Steffy, to     

629
00:24:04,744 --> 00:24:06,977
The right thing for me to do is 
to go running to Steffy, to     
Hope, to Liam, to the police,   

630
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:10,014
to go running to Steffy, to     
Hope, to Liam, to the police,   
just shouting and screaming to  

631
00:24:10,016 --> 00:24:11,949
Hope, to Liam, to the police,   
just shouting and screaming to  
all what you did!               

632
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:16,520
just shouting and screaming to  
all what you did!               
That's the right thing.         

633
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:19,857
all what you did!               
That's the right thing.         
But you're my father, and that  

634
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:22,459
That's the right thing.         
But you're my father, and that  
baby is in good hands.          

635
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,595
But you're my father, and that  
baby is in good hands.          
I mean, Steffy just -- she      

636
00:24:24,597 --> 00:24:25,696
baby is in good hands.          
I mean, Steffy just -- she      
adores her.                     

637
00:24:25,698 --> 00:24:28,799
I mean, Steffy just -- she      
adores her.                     
She is Phoebe's mother in every 

638
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,768
adores her.                     
She is Phoebe's mother in every 
sense of the word.              

639
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:33,470
She is Phoebe's mother in every 
sense of the word.              
It just --                      

640
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:36,507
sense of the word.              
It just --                      
To take her away now, it seems  

641
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:37,441
It just --                      
To take her away now, it seems  
cruel.                          

642
00:24:37,443 --> 00:24:39,510
To take her away now, it seems  
cruel.                          
>> Reese: So what are you       

643
00:24:39,512 --> 00:24:40,344
cruel.                          
>> Reese: So what are you       
saying?                         

644
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:43,447
>> Reese: So what are you       
saying?                         
>> Zoe: I'm saying I hate what  

645
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:44,615
saying?                         
>> Zoe: I'm saying I hate what  
you did.                        

646
00:24:44,617 --> 00:24:47,151
>> Zoe: I'm saying I hate what  
you did.                        
Every bit of it.                

647
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:49,520
you did.                        
Every bit of it.                
You put me in a terrible        

648
00:24:49,522 --> 00:24:50,688
Every bit of it.                
You put me in a terrible        
position.                       

649
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,690
You put me in a terrible        
position.                       
And, you know, you said you     

650
00:24:52,692 --> 00:24:54,925
position.                       
And, you know, you said you     
don't expect me to forgive you. 

651
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:57,361
And, you know, you said you     
don't expect me to forgive you. 
Yeah, I don't know yet if I     

652
00:24:57,363 --> 00:24:58,128
don't expect me to forgive you. 
Yeah, I don't know yet if I     
will.                           

653
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:01,832
Yeah, I don't know yet if I     
will.                           
I guess time will tell.         

654
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:06,804
will.                           
I guess time will tell.         
But, uh, I do know that         

655
00:25:06,806 --> 00:25:09,440
I guess time will tell.         
But, uh, I do know that         
I love you.                     

656
00:25:09,442 --> 00:25:12,042
But, uh, I do know that         
I love you.                     
That will never change.         

657
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:14,545
I love you.                     
That will never change.         
And I don't want you to go to   

658
00:25:14,547 --> 00:25:15,412
That will never change.         
And I don't want you to go to   
prison.                         

659
00:25:15,414 --> 00:25:18,082
And I don't want you to go to   
prison.                         
So...                           

660
00:25:18,084 --> 00:25:22,653
prison.                         
So...
