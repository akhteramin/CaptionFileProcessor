SO HERE'S MY IDEA.              

308
00:09:05,631 --> 00:09:07,398
SO HERE'S MY IDEA.              
LET ME PUT IT OUT THERE.        

309
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,869
LET ME PUT IT OUT THERE.        
FIRST OF ALL, YOU HAVE GOT      

310
00:09:11,871 --> 00:09:13,804
FIRST OF ALL, YOU HAVE GOT      
$1.5 TRILLION OF STUDENT DEBT   

311
00:09:13,806 --> 00:09:15,873
$1.5 TRILLION OF STUDENT DEBT   
RIGHT NOW IN THIS COUNTRY, A LOT

312
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:18,509
RIGHT NOW IN THIS COUNTRY, A LOT
OF HOME MORTGAGE DEBT, A LOT OF 

313
00:09:18,511 --> 00:09:19,310
OF HOME MORTGAGE DEBT, A LOT OF 
CREDIT CARD DEBT.               

314

CREDIT CARD DEBT.               
OUR GOVERNMENT ALSO HAS A LOT OF

OUR GOVERNMENT ALSO HAS A LOT OF
DEBT.                           

316
00:09:21,047 --> 00:09:22,880
DEBT.                           
SO THE FIRST THING I WOULD DO IS

317
00:09:22,882 --> 00:09:24,915
SO THE FIRST THING I WOULD DO IS
ALLOW STUDENTS AND NO MATTER HOW

318
00:09:24,917 --> 00:09:29,653
ALLOW STUDENTS AND NO MATTER HOW
OLD THEY ARE, FORMER STUN TO    

319
00:09:29,655 --> 00:09:31,655
OLD THEY ARE, FORMER STUN TO    
REFINANCE THEIR STUDENT LOANS AT

320
00:09:31,657 --> 00:09:32,289
REFINANCE THEIR STUDENT LOANS AT
THAT RATE THAT'S A LITTLE ABOVE 

321
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:32,957
THAT RATE THAT'S A LITTLE ABOVE 
3%, WE COULD EVEN GO LOWER TO   

322
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,759
3%, WE COULD EVEN GO LOWER TO   
FIND SOME EVEN BETTER RATE THAN 

323
00:09:34,761 --> 00:09:35,059
FIND SOME EVEN BETTER RATE THAN 
THAT.                           

324
00:09:35,061 --> 00:09:36,360
THAT.                           
BUT THAT'S WHAT I THINK WE NEED 

325
00:09:36,362 --> 00:09:38,095
BUT THAT'S WHAT I THINK WE NEED 
TO DO TO BRING THE INTEREST RATE

326
00:09:38,097 --> 00:09:39,397
TO DO TO BRING THE INTEREST RATE
PAYMENTS DOWN FOR THOSE         

327
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:40,297
PAYMENTS DOWN FOR THOSE

328
00:09:40,299 --> 00:09:42,633
AMERICANS THAT STILL HAVE THE   
STUDENT LOANS.

00:09:42,635 --> 00:09:43,300
STUDENT LOANS.                  
THE SECOND THING I WOULD DO IS

EXPAND PROGRAMS AND MAKE IT     
EASIER FOR PEOPLE DEPENDING ON  

332
00:09:50,109 --> 00:09:51,776
EASIER FOR PEOPLE DEPENDING ON  
YOUR INCOME LEVEL TO MAKE THAT  

333
00:09:51,778 --> 00:09:53,044
YOUR INCOME LEVEL TO MAKE THAT  
EASIER AS WELL AS THE AMOUNT OF 

334
00:09:53,046 --> 00:09:53,878
EASIER AS WELL AS THE AMOUNT OF 
MONEY YOU GET.                  

335
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,180
MONEY YOU GET.                  
THE THIRD THING I DO IS BRING   

336
00:09:56,182 --> 00:09:57,715

LET ME TALK AT WE NEED          

543
00:15:46,967 --> 00:15:48,200
LET ME TALK AT WE NEED          
TO DO IN AMERICA AS OPPOSED TO

548
00:15:53,074 --> 00:15:55,641

I NOTE ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE   
ACT SIDE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE, IT'S 

550
00:15:56,777 --> 00:15:58,344
ACT SIDE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE, IT'S 
HAD A MAJOR IMPACT.             

551
00:15:58,346 --> 00:16:00,079
HAD A MAJOR IMPACT.             
ONE, YOU CAN KEEP ON YOUR       

552
00:16:00,081 --> 00:16:01,914
ONE, YOU CAN KEEP ON YOUR       
PARENTS INSURANCE UNTIL YOU'RE

554
00:16:03,484 --> 00:16:05,384
26, RIGHT?                      
TWO, WE'VE SEEN HALF OF THE     

555
00:16:05,386 --> 00:16:08,320
TWO, WE'VE SEEN HALF OF THE     
YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE UNINSURED, 

556
00:16:08,322 --> 00:16:09,388
YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE UNINSURED, 
THEY'VE BECOME INSURED BECAUSE  

557
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,155
THEY'VE BECOME INSURED BECAUSE  
OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT,     

558
00:16:10,157 --> 00:16:11,490
OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT,     
WHICH IS A BIG DEAL.            

559
00:16:11,492 --> 00:16:14,426
WHICH IS A BIG DEAL.            
AND THREE, ONE OUT OF SIX OF YOU

560
00:16:14,428 --> 00:16:15,961
AND THREE, ONE OUT OF SIX OF YOU
ACTUALLY HAVE PRE-EXISTING      

561
00:16:15,963 --> 00:16:16,262
ACTUALLY HAVE PRE-EXISTING      
CONDITIONS.                     

562
00:16:16,264 --> 00:16:17,396
CONDITIONS.                     
SO IF WE GET RID OF THE         

563
00:16:17,398 --> 00:16:18,397
SO IF WE GET RID OF THE         
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, WHICH IS   

564
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,832
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, WHICH IS   
WHAT THIS PRESIDENT IS TRYING TO

565
00:16:19,834 --> 00:16:21,867
WHAT THIS PRESIDENT IS TRYING TO
DO, ALL OF THOSE BENEFITS WILL  

566
00:16:21,869 --> 00:16:22,234
DO, ALL OF THOSE BENEFITS WILL  
GO AWAY.                        

567
00:16:22,236 --> 00:16:24,737
GO AWAY.                        
SO MY FIRST FOCUS IS MAKING SURE

568
00:16:24,739 --> 00:16:27,172
SO MY FIRST FOCUS IS MAKING SURE
WE KEEP THAT IN PLACE BUT WE    

569
00:16:27,174 --> 00:16:29,008
WE KEEP THAT IN PLACE BUT WE    
IMPROVE IT BY BRINGING PREMIUMS 

570
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,943
IMPROVE IT BY BRINGING PREMIUMS 
DOWN.                           

571
00:16:30,945 --> 00:16:32,077
DOWN.                           
YOU CAN DO THAT MANY WAYS.      

572
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,380
YOU CAN DO THAT MANY WAYS.      
ONE OF MY MAJOR PROPOSALS IS TO 

573
00:16:34,382 --> 00:16:36,115
ONE OF MY MAJOR PROPOSALS IS TO 
BRING BACK THE PUBLIC OPTIONS   

574
00:16:36,117 --> 00:16:37,750
BRING BACK THE PUBLIC OPTIONS   
IDEA THAT'S BEEN FLOATING AROUND

575
00:16:37,752 --> 00:16:40,085
IDEA THAT'S BEEN FLOATING AROUND
THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PUT IN THE

576
00:16:40,087 --> 00:16:40,719
THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PUT IN THE
FIRST PLACE.                    

577
00:16:40,721 --> 00:16:45,958
FIRST PLACE.                    
YOU CAN DO IT WITH MEDICAID OR  

578
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,525
YOU CAN DO IT WITH MEDICAID OR  
MEDICARE SO YOU HAVE A LESS     

579
00:16:46,527 --> 00:16:47,159
MEDICARE SO YOU HAVE A LESS     
EXPENSIVE OPTION TO PICK FROM.  

580
00:16:47,161 --> 00:16:48,561
EXPENSIVE OPTION TO PICK FROM.  
THE OTHER THING I WOULD DO IS TO

581
00:16:48,563 --> 00:16:51,564
THE OTHER THING I WOULD DO IS TO
BRING DOWN THE COST OF          

582
00:16:51,566 --> 00:16:51,931
BRING DOWN THE COST OF          
PHARMACEUTICALS.

00:36:25,394 --> 00:36:27,494
IN WHITE COATS.                 
99 OF THEM WERE ON ONE ONE SIDE 

1123

AND ONE ON THE OTHER, TO SHOW   

1124
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:30,130
AND ONE ON THE OTHER, TO SHOW   
THAT THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY

CROSS EVERY "T" IN A SHORT      
PERIOD OF TIME, BUT WE NEED     

1132
00:36:43,078 --> 00:36:44,010
