I've been awake                 
the whole night.                

32
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:33,785
There's only one thing          
we can say.                     

33
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,687
We have to tell Cora.           

34
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:37,456
         Well, isn't that rather
                     a betrayal?

35
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,391
If anything happens to Edith    

36
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:42,027
and Cora learns later           
we knew all along,              

37
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:43,729
she would never forgive us.     

38
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:45,998
And I wouldn't blame her.       

39
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:48,700
You see, as a mother,           
it is her right.                

40
00:02:48,736 --> 00:02:50,335
              But you don't plan
                 to tell Robert?

41
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:52,037
           He is Edith's father.

42
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:53,572
He's a man.                     

43
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:55,340
Men don't have rights.          

44
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:59,678
                 They telephoned
       Lady Rosamund last night.

45
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:01,313
     She's on the way here now. 

46
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,515
It seems very hard              
they should have guests staying 

47
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,851
and more coming for dinner      
with this going on.             

48
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:07,352
         I suppose they couldn't
                    put them off

49
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:08,653
       without telling them why.

00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,022
It'll make                      
for a funny evening.            

51
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,959
 We still don't know anything.  

52
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:15,193
Well, we know she's             
in London.                      

53
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:16,528
The station master said         
she bought a ticket             

54
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:17,529
for King's Cross.               

55
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:18,997
   But where can she            
   be hiding?                   

56
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:20,565
  It seems a terrific imposition
              for us to be here.

57
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:22,067
     Should we just leave?      

58
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:23,068
Why?                            

59
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:24,336
We've got Dicky Merton,         

60
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,738
the Sinderbys and their son     
arriving at any minute.         

61
00:03:26,774 --> 00:03:27,873
We could put them off.          

62
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:28,740
         Please don't.          

63
00:03:28,776 --> 00:03:29,741
 They're looking forward to it  
            awfully.            

64
00:03:29,777 --> 00:03:30,742
       You mean<i> you</i> are.        

65
00:03:30,778 --> 00:03:31,877
  I don't think                 
  we should.                    

66
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:33,011
  We have to give               
  the impression                

67
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:34,212
           that Edith has simply
    gone away to stay somewhere.

68
00:03:34,248 --> 00:03:36,048
     How terribly worrying      
        this is for you.        

69
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,016
         I'm so sorry.          

70
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:39,418
                Oh, why the song
                      and dance?

71
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:41,219
              Edith's gone away,
                        so what?

72
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:43,688
 We three should go for a walk  
    and leave them to talk.     

73
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,123
                     Tony can be
                      our guide.

74
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,925
        He must know the gardens
             pretty well by now.

75
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,493
                         ROBERT:
         Can you shed any light?

76
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:49,961
  I've been racking my brains.  

77
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:51,863
VIOLET:                         
Maybe we should                 
take some air.                  

78
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:54,466
        I think we might        
       emulate the others       

79
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:55,767
and let Cora                    
show us the garden.             

80
00:03:55,803 --> 00:03:57,335
                    I'm not sure
           what good that'll do.

81
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:59,704
  When I say we need some air,  
       we need some air.        

82
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,705
             Cora?

If it's what you want.          

84
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:03,241
      Mary, you can manage      
          the children          

85
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:04,242
      when they get here?       

86
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:05,944
        Of course.              

87
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,213
  There's a person downstairs,  
            m'lady.             

88
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,415
A Mrs. Drewe                    
from Yew Tree Farm.             

89
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:12,284
She's very anxious              
to see you.                     

90
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,452
CORA:                           
Oh, well...                     

91
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:15,887
           You'd better show her
           into my sitting room.

92
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:17,489
I'm sorry, Mama.                

93
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:19,491
        You go ahead without me.

94
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:20,725
       I can take you for a walk
                    if you like.

95
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:23,295
   Why would I want to walk?!   

96
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,670
    I'm going in to change.     

97
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:34,005
      I'll sneak upstairs       
    so I don't disturb them.    

98
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,941
              See you at dinner.

99
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:37,642
    Not if I see you first.     

100
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:42,447
             I don't understand.

101
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,049
           You're so well suited

102
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:45,517
            and you're much more
                relaxed with her

103
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:46,918
         than you are with Mary.

104
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:47,953
     Yes.                       

105
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:49,521
        You must admit it's odd.

106
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:51,189
              When Mary's trying
                 to break it off

107
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:53,592
               and Mabel's dying
                for love of you.

108
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:56,061
I know, but you see,            
I can't break it off with Mary. 

109
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:57,429
     Not now.                   

110
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:58,763
               Why not?         

111
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,332
Well, I won't explain it,       

112
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:02,367
but suffice to say,             
it wouldn't be honorable.       

113
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,769
You are an old dear             

114
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,838
if you think I don't know       
what you're talking about.      

115
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:08,473
        But isn't it up to Mary?

116
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,108
It's not what she wants.        

117
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,143
Not really.                     

118
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:13,812
Did she look like               
a woman today                   

119
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:16,548
trying to rid herself           
of a suitor?                    

120
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,717
                 You're muddling
                   her instinct,

121
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:20,318
                which is to hold
            every man in thrall,

122
00:05:20,354 --> 00:05:21,753
                   and her wish,

123
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:24,022
which is to break up.           

124
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:25,890
I'm not convinced.              

125
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:28,760
            I wish you would be,
            for everyone's sake.

126
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:33,765
Who was that letter from?       

127
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,933
                      Mr. Brook.

128
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:36,601
              He's got a new job
                     in Salford,

129
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:38,737
       so he doesn't want       
      to renew the lease.       

130
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:40,739
                 We need to find
        another tenant, damn it.

131
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:42,140
Don't be ungrateful.            

132
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,943
I bless your mother every day   
for leaving us that house.      

133
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:46,544
    When you have property,     
       you have choices.        

134
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,580
     So what should we do?      

135
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:51,483
        After he's gone,        
let's ask for time off together,

136
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,785
 go down and see what condition 
        he's left it in.        

137
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,819
       Then we can plan.        

138
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,756
      Why are you smiling?      

139
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,224
                Because whenever
                I see a problem,

140
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:01,926
  you see only possibilities.   

141
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:05,030
(knock at door)                 

142
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:08,900
        May we come in?         

143
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,035
           Of course.           

144
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,102
    You've come back early.     

145
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:12,937
                        Yes.    

146
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:15,807
                We rather wanted
         to catch you in private

147
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:17,342
for a little chat.              

148
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,743
Before the evening begins.      

149
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:19,744
                      Very well.

150
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,646
       Thank you, Baxter.       

151
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,720
       Did you both know?       

152
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,855
              Mrs. Drewe told me
                  Rosamund knew.

153
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,757
        You went to see         
     the child with Edith.      

154
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:34,325
    Yes.                        

155
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:36,327
And you never thought to tell me
 that I have a third grandchild?

156
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:37,328
Edith didn't want me to.        

157
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:38,396
                       I suppose
                this makes sense

158
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:40,465
    of that bewildering trip    
        to Switzerland.         

159
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,933
Well, what else                 
was I to do?                    

160
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:43,301
She wouldn't                    
get rid of it.                  

161
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:44,369
         Get rid of it?         

162
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,537
It was her idea.                

163
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:48,073
But she wouldn't go through     
with it in the end.             

164
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:49,908
     And what did you know?     

165
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:52,744
        Well, not quite as much.

166
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:55,113
            I knew why they were
                 in Switzerland.

167
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,848
            I thought she'd left
                 the baby there.

168
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,651
That was the idea.              

169
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:02,287
       Edith didn't stick to it.

170
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:04,856
     And you never thought      
to involve me, her own mother?! 

171
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:08,159
       You, Rosamund, you looked
             at that little girl

172
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:10,295
     and you never thought      
   it was my business, too?!    

173
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,331
               W-well, we wanted
                  to contain it,

174
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:15,166
to make as little               
noise abroad                    

175
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:16,434
               as possible.     

176
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,569
                         So what
                        changed?

177
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,737
 What tipped her over the edge  
     and into running away?     

178
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:23,274
     Well, I suppose we all knew
           Mr. Gregson was dead,

179
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,578
       but the confirmation must
       have been very upsetting.

180
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:29,013
ROSAMUND:                       
And Mrs. Drewe                  
was being difficult.            

181
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:32,417
Clearly, the child couldn't     
stay there indefinitely.        

182
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,286
So we thought...                

183
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:36,354
      What did you think?       

184
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:37,989
That it would be                
better and safer                

185
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,657
if the girl                     
were sent abroad.               

186
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:41,459
     To Switzerland again,      
           I suppose?           

187
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:43,194
                 Switzerland.   

188
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,330
Or France.                      

189
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:47,265
             They have wonderful
                   schools there

190
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,167
            that'll take a child
              almost from birth.

191
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:50,668
     Well, now we have it!      

192
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:52,971
    Edith was told her child    
      would be taken away.      

193
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:56,441
          Are you going to say  
           anything to Robert?  

194
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,642
                             No.

195
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:58,877
    I agree with one thing:     

196
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:00,211
           the secret           
      is not ours to tell.      

197
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:02,013
                        Somehow,
             we must find Edith,

198
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:06,718
   and we must hear from her    
        what<i> she</i> wants.         

199
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:16,628
     M'lady?                    

200
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,129
I'm sorry to bother you.        

201
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,098
        What is it, Mrs. Hughes?

202
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:22,467
It may have slipped             
your mind, m'lady,              

203
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,602
but do you remember             
I gave you a train ticket       

204
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:26,604
when we came to London          
for Lady Rose's ball?           

205
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,841
It was a return ticket          
that I found in the pocket      

206
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,809
of Mr. Bates' overcoat?         

207
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,645
MARY:                           
Of course I remember.           

208
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,681
MRS. HUGHES:                    
I don't suppose you put it      
anywhere for safekeeping?       

209
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:38,816
                    Why?        

210
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,351
Because we were wrong.          

211
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:42,353
Far from proving                
that Mr. Bates went to London   

212
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:45,356
on the day Mr. Green died,      
it proved he didn't.            

213
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:48,493
He bought the ticket in York,   
but changed his mind,           

214
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,195
and that's why it was           
never given in.                 

215
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:53,064
                 So it was proof
               of his innocence,

216
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:54,065
                  not his guilt?

217
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,900
That's about the size of it.    

218
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:59,304
          I'm afraid I burnt it,
                    Mrs. Hughes.

219
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:04,742
            Atticus!            

220
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,983
             Hello.             

221
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,184
         Lord and Lady Sinderby.

222
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,552
  Good evening, Rose.           

223
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:15,687
         Oh, you know my cousin?

224
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:16,788
         Of course.             

225
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:18,456
         We were in awe         
   of your courage yesterday.   

226
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,091
Well, courage                   
or foolhardiness.               

227
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:22,093
Come and see                    
Mama and Papa.                  

228
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:28,366
             To be honest, we're
in the middle of rather a drama,

229
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,435
      which I'll tell you about,
         but you mustn't let on.

230
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,669
Our first secret.               

231
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,140
This is cold                    
so it can go up now,            

232
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:37,875
but cover it                    
'til it's served.               

233
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,610
    Shall we work on<i> Vanity Fair</i>
   when you're finished tonight?

234
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:40,611
         I don't know.          

235
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:43,181
       Well, I'll ask you later.

236
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:45,516
     Lord Merton's arrived,     
      so everyone's here.       

237
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:46,884
                I'll announce it
              when you're ready.

238
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,920
I will be                       
by the time you say it.         

239
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,255
You're very glum.               

240
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,256
                    Am I?       

241
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:54,058
Oh, don't tell me               
your enthusiasm for learning    

242
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,460
is drying up.                   

243
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:56,461
                          Maybe.

244
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:57,895
                   Have you read
              the papers lately?

245
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,897
I wish I had the time.          

246
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,967
     Mr. MacDonald seems to limp
          from crisis to crisis.

247
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:05,269
   They were going to do so much
              when they came in.

248
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:07,371
    The first Labour government!

249
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:09,373
                And now, I doubt
       if they'll last the year.

250
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:10,575
Don't take it personally.       

251
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,576
                       But I do.

252
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,910
          When I think about it,

253
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,312
                  it seems to me
             that we're trapped,

254
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,247
           held fast in a system

255
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,482
          that gives us no value
                 and no freedom.

256
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:19,684
Oy, speak for yourself.         

257
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:20,918
                   I am... I do.

258
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,954
          And now I'm wondering,
                 is it worth it,

259
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:24,222
     me trying to better myself?

260
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:25,523
               What's the point?

261
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:26,958
          That's it--           
       they're coming in.       

262
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:42,406
          Miss Baxter.          

263
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:45,610
      I'm afraid you think      
I've got you both into trouble. 

264
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,944
  I don't know what you mean.   

265
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,646
                    Yes, you do.

266
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:49,814
     I said I had no proof.     

267
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:51,149
      I gave them nothing       
      that would stand up.      

268
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:52,950
        Why did you have        
        to say anything?        

269
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,119
 I was in a difficult position. 

270
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,354
  So now you've put us in one.  

271
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,322
I'm very sorry.                 

272
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:00,024
          I am, truly.          

273
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:03,394
  I have to clean some shoes.   

274
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,808
        Are you enjoying        
           Yorkshire?           

275
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,711
Well, first, we and Yorkshire   
have to get used to each other. 

276
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:23,915
 But you haven't come up against
   too many impassable barriers?

277
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,783
Lord Grantham, we both know     
what we're up against.          

278
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:27,251
Happily, we're used to it.      

279
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:28,819
            Well, you won't have
            any trouble with us.

280
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,655
     Lady Grantham's father     
          was Jewish.           

281
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,823
That isn't always               
a guarantee of tolerance,       

282
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,859
so it's a relief                
to hear you say it.             

283
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:39,497
Atticus seems to be             
very taken with your niece,     

284
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,065
               and I must say...

285
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,400
   (laughs)                     

286
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:43,868
I find her quite charming.      

287
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:45,903
     Does Lord Sinderby approve?

288
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:47,572
Well, you know,                 

289
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:49,106
                   he needs time

290
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:50,574
to settle into things.          

291
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,145
Your mother never               
considered converting?          

292
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,980
             I don't believe so.

293
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:57,648
        Was it difficult        

294
00:11:57,684 --> 00:12:00,751
  having a different religion   
      from your father's?       

295
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:02,286
              Not that I recall.

296
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:06,190
         But you're not         
        ashamed of him?         

297
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:09,160
Lord Sinderby, I would point out
that we never changed our name. 

298
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:10,962
              Hmm.              

299
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:13,464
    It was my grandfather's     
           decision.            

300
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:16,867
 I thought of changing it back, 
      but the family felt       

301
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,904
they were English now,          
and they wanted to stay English.

302
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:22,039
        Have you decided at last
         whether you're leaving?

303
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,241
"At last"                       
is the right phrase.            

304
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:26,911
But I want to make sure         
I do the right thing.           

305
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:28,479
I don't want to disrupt         
Sybbie's life                   

306
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:29,747
and then regret it.             

307
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:31,415
               You know they all
               want you to stay?

308
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,354
That only makes it              
more difficult.                 

309
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:37,855
        Lord Grantham was saying

310
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,024
    that Gregson left Lady Edith
         his publishing company.

311
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,392
Yes, that's right.              

312
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,960
          Then shouldn't someone
           telephone the office?

313
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:44,695
             Won't she go there?

314
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:47,131
                  They must know
              where to find her.

315
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,466
     Of course.                 

316
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:50,101
  How clever you are.           

317
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:51,335
                    Am I?       

318
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:53,037
                 It seems rather
                  obvious to me.

319
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,106
                           ROSE:
          Your mother and Robert

320
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:56,640
are hitting it off.             

321
00:12:56,676 --> 00:12:58,008
          She's not the problem.

322
00:12:58,044 --> 00:12:58,843
       Oh?                      

323
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:00,878
      My father's the tough nut.

324
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,081
My people are                   
the other way round.            

325
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,950
My father's a darling           
and my mother's the nut.        

326
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:08,185
        Then we shall crack them
             against each other.

327
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:10,421
           (laughing)           

328
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:14,358
    It's strange how some people
        get married and married,

329
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:16,427
                    and we can't
                 manage it once.

330
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,663
  Dogs barking and wrong trees  
        spring to mind.         

331
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:22,433
Tony, I'm sorry                 
if you feel                     

332
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,435
        I'm tracking you        
       round the country,       

333
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,270
 but I can't give up just yet.  

334
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,139
   We could be so very happy    
        if you'd let us.        

335
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,141
                  And I won't be
                     if I don't?

336
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:34,378
I remember my mother telling me 
        that in the end,        

337
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:36,046
     happiness is a matter      
           of choice.           

338
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:38,682
Some people choose              
to be happy,                    

339
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:40,184
   and others select a course   

340
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:42,319
 that leads only to frustration 
      and disappointment.       

341
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:44,121
                    And I am one
                  of the latter?

342
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,322
      I terribly hope not.      

343
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:46,357
          For my sake.          

344
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:50,761
      (guests fall silent)      

345
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:52,863
 I have a little announcement.  

346
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:54,331
         Are you sure?          

347
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:55,099
             I am.              

348
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:58,702
     You might like to know     

349
00:13:58,738 --> 00:13:59,804
that Lord Merton and I          

350
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,106
      have decided that we      
      should get married.       

351
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:04,675
    (guests respond happily)    

352
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,310
                     How lovely.

353
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,145
                Well, this calls
                    for a toast.

354
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,214
I give you Mrs. Crawley,        

355
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:13,083
        or should I say         
    the future Lady Merton?     

356
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:16,020
              ALL:              
    The future Lady Merton.     

357
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:17,221
    The future Lady Merton.     

358
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,593
Naturally, it was the last thing
  I ever thought would happen.  

359
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:23,594
           (laughter)           

360
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,095
I forced her into it.           

361
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:28,465
  He wooed me into it, and I'm  
    terribly pleased he did.    

362
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:31,302
                    Well...     

363
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:35,272
   What's the matter, Granny?   

364
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:37,141
          Oh, nothing.          

365
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:38,442
      Why should there be?      

366
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:41,278
      I thought you looked      
         rather bleak.          

367
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:42,780
 I'm just worried about Edith.  

368
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,281
       I can't think why.       

369
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:47,818
 My dear, a lack of compassion  

370
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:51,021
                can be as vulgar
          as an excess of tears.

371
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,360
                      Ah, Daisy.

372
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,628
               Have you decided?

373
00:14:57,663 --> 00:15:00,364
      Shall we discuss the vices
            of Miss Becky Sharp?

374
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,298
           I'm tired.           

375
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:02,232
         I'm going up.          

376
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:03,267
   Good night, Mrs. Patmore.    

377
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:06,870
       What's that about?       

378
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,539
She had such hopes              
of the Labour government.       

379
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,341
She feels let down.             

380
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:11,642
        But she mustn't give up.

381
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:13,377
       I don't recall you       
        being this keen         

382
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,712
       when Miss Bunting        
       was teaching her.        

383
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,615
      I wouldn't interfere      
      with a professional,      

384
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,817
    but now that she's gone,    

385
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:21,385
                I'd like to help
                       if I can.

386
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,521
   Sounds to me as if you've    
  missed out on your vocation.  

387
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:25,522
          Tell Daisy.           

388
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:26,857
Perhaps you can change her mind.

389
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:28,192
      She wouldn't listen to me.

390
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:29,593
                   Well spotted.

391
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:31,395
     What about Mr. Mason?      

392
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,398
Funnily enough, Mr. Barrow      
might be right for once.        

393
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,033
       How do we get him        
        to speak to her?        

394
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:38,068
      Let me think on it.       

395
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:45,042
             CORA:              
      I'm sorry if I seem       
          distracted,           

396
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:47,444
          but I'm truly so happy
                for both of you.

397
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,047
  I thought I'd give a dinner   
    so she can meet my sons.    

398
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:52,449
               Well, she has met
                   Larry before.

399
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:53,584
  Let's hope she's forgotten.   

400
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,285
                    Why don't we
                     do it here?

401
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:57,488
          We could invite Granny
                   and everyone.

402
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,323
            You are my godfather

403
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,658
    and Isobel's the grandmother
                    of my child.

404
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:02,793
               Oh, please let's.

405
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,328
                   It seems only
                    right, Mama.

406
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:05,763
                   Of course,   
               if you'd like.   

407
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:06,930
Well, that'd be very kind.      

408
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,299
A signing of the bond           
between our families.           

409
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:10,768
I wish we didn't know           
the anguish                     

410
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,036
lurking behind                  
this jolly evening.             

411
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:13,337
         You love other people's
                        secrets.

412
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,206
        Not these days.         

413
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:19,042
    There are lots of things    
     I don't want to know.      

414
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:20,043
                        Such as?

415
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,480
      I don't want to know      
     what you see in Mary.      

416
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:26,850
     I just want you back.      

417
00:16:26,886 --> 00:16:29,353
                 I do admire you
                for saying that.

418
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:32,423
I'd rather be happy than proud. 

419
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,925
                I can't tell you
         why I can't leave Mary.

420
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,593
            But you'd understand
                       if I did.

421
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:38,695
        Just promise me         
        it's a struggle.        

422
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:39,963
             More than you know.

423
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:43,834
          We must go,           
    but it's been such fun.     

424
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:45,469
    I hope you'll come to us    
           next time.           

425
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,804
              We should love it.

426
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,940
      I suppose now we just have
   to wait and see what happens.

427
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:51,809
LORD SINDERBY:                  
There's no need to hurry them   
into anything.                  

428
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,510
They're both very young.        

429
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:57,681
   Well, I would be delighted   
if something were to come of it.

430
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:59,249
   Good night, Lady Grantham,   
         Lady Rosamund.         

431
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:03,654
       The door, please,        
           Molesley.            

432
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,958
I'm afraid your plan of getting 
   Mabel here hasn't worked.    

433
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:09,092
                     I disagree.

434
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:11,094
                 They're so easy
        in each other's company.

435
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,095
              Anyone can see it.

436
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:13,096
But he won't let me go.         

437
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:15,532
              Because you refuse
                to make it clear

438
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:17,334
           that you want him to.

439
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,570
        Just as he's moving off,
            you tug his strings.

440
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,305
           Send a clear message,
                   and he'll go.

441
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,306
                I promise.      

442
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:23,373
     What is that message?      

443
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:27,177
       We'll think of something.

444
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,179
    (Rose clears her throat)    

445
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,448
 Atticus says the London office 
        of the magazine         

446
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:33,317
            must know how to get
            in touch with Edith.

447
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:34,952
    I thought we weren't going  
               to tell anyone.  

448
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:36,253
He's not "anyone," is he?       

449
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:37,120
                  Of course not.

450
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:38,689
              We could ring them
                       tomorrow,

451
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,224
              but maybe I should
                  just go there.

452
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:43,760
        Mr. Aldridge is leaving.

453
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:44,795
    Oh.                         

454
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,765
         I'll train up          
        in the morning.         

455
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:49,766
I'm coming with you.            

456
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:50,701
                  I'm not going.

457
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,237
  But I'll have a horrible day  
           worrying.            

458
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:54,304
           Trust me.            

459
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,773
      How can you imagine       
   I'll ever trust you again?   

460
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:02,746
She doesn't mean it, Mama.      

461
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,414
        On the contrary,        
   it's the most honest thing   

462
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,882
     she's ever said to me.     

463
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,720
             ANNA:              
         <i> Here you are.</i>         

464
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:10,954
                Thank you.      

465
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:21,098
                     Is our life
               over-complicated?

466
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,568
In what way?                    

467
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,004
          Mrs. Patmore is buying
                a house up here.

468
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,573
  Why don't we sell the London  
     house and do the same?     

469
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,042
 We could rent it out as long as
     we want to work at Downton.

470
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:33,710
      And then live in it       
        when we retire?         

471
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:35,779
      We had a dream once       

472
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:38,248
                of a small hotel
                    in the area.

473
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,916
      And a London house,       
       even a little one,       

474
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,852
      would buy something       
      substantial up here.      

475
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:43,920
I hate to say his name,         

476
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,857
but do you feel the whole       
business of Mr. Green           

477
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:48,558
might be over?                  

478
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:50,394
For us, I mean.                 

479
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,229
    Well, they seem to have     
       accepted the fact        

480
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:53,764
 that I spent the day in York,  

481
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,867
  and Miss Baxter has given them
           nothing new to go on.

482
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:59,202
     So we can dare to plan     
       our future again?        

483
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:00,303
      Like normal people?       

484
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,606
         Does that mean         
     what I hope it means?      

485
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,541
   Mr. Bates, I thought you'd   
     decided to believe me      

486
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:05,976
    when I said that device     
        was Lady Mary's?        

487
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:07,144
       I do believe you.        

488
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:08,578
        I don't know why        
         she wanted it,         

489
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:09,312
              but I believe you.

490
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:10,080
          Well, then.           

491
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:13,083
   You don't suppose there's    
anything wrong with us, do you? 

492
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:15,452
              No.               

493
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,922
  I think it takes some people  
      longer than others.       

494
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,090
          That's all.           

495
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,292
  What would I do without you?  

496
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:28,265
          Did they get away?    

497
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,366
        Just about.             

498
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:31,501
      The train was late,       
         thank heaven.          

499
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:32,969
              And it isn't going
                     to be Tony?

500
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,838
       I don't think so.        

501
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:36,440
                    Nor Charles?

502
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:38,175
        He decided that         
         before I did.          

503
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,509
                     Well, well.

504
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:41,211
            I don't suppose your
        ancient father's opinion

505
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:43,213
                on these matters
            carries much weight?

506
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:45,282
          Afraid not,           
    and I've just remembered    

507
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:47,050
         I said I'd go          
        and see Granny.         

508
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:55,659
 So, I don't think Tony is going
       to be my next son-in-law.

509
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:56,993
I don't believe he is.          

510
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:00,230
                         Pity.  

511
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:02,466
   I would have been so pleased,
               but there we are.

512
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,801
You're really not yourself,     
are you, old girl?              

513
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:06,403
        What about you?         

514
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:08,638
    We don't want you to be     
 on your own forever, you know. 

515
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,607
Just to pick someone who shares 
      the family's values.      

516
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:11,708
            (laughs)            

517
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:13,043
       Someone who feels        
      friendly towards us.      

518
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:14,644
        It's not the same thing.

519
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,079
No, you're right.               

520
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:19,749
And I don't blame you for       
the departure of Miss Bunting.  

521
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:22,686
I didn't want to spend my life  
in a bare knuckle fight.        

522
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,721
        But something's changed.

523
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:25,722
                  I feel it.    

524
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:27,924
    I may as well tell you:     

525
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,594
   I've written to my cousin    
           in Boston.           

526
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:31,995
     He's done well there,      

527
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,797
and I'd like his advice.        

528
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:35,398
                 I see.         

529
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:39,269
   I apologize if my bad manners
           have brought this on.

530
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:40,470
No need to apologize.           

531
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:43,206
I am what I am                  
and you are what you are.       

532
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,541
             And never the twain
                     shall meet?

533
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:45,542
I wouldn't say that.            

534
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,211
I do love you all,              
you know.                       

535
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,046
It'll be hard to go.            

536
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,982
                  On both sides.

537
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,252
         RECEPTIONIST:          
 But we have no way of knowing  

538
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,721
         if Lady Edith          
      will come in today.       

539
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,223
          It's already tea time,
and we close the office at 6:00.

540
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,092
Then we'll wait                 
until 6:00.                     

541
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:03,593
             And we'll come back
                 in the morning,

542
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:04,928
and every day                   

543
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:06,363
       until she either turns up

544
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:08,064
                 or contacts you
           with her whereabouts.

545
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,766
     It wouldn't be enough      
     to give her a message      

546
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:10,967
                   that you want
                     to see her?

547
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:12,402
CORA:                           
No, it would not be enough.     

548
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:20,510
You've told her,                
haven't you?                    

549
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:22,646
    You've broken your word.    

550
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:24,247
    No, I...                    

551
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,049
                 Mrs. Drewe came
                   to the house.

552
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:27,584
       What did she want?       

553
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,586
                She felt you had
                 used her badly.

554
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,855
                I confess it was
            a feeling we shared.

555
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:34,257
      I'm not coming back,      
           you know.            

556
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,458
                  Let's not talk
                  about it here.

557
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:36,459
Come to me for dinner.          

558
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:37,994
              No.               

559
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:41,064
        Very well, then.        

560
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:42,732
      We'll discuss it now      
 in front of your new employees 

561
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:44,534
    and give them something     
          to chew on.           

562
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,937
      There is a tea room       
   at the end of the street.    

563
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,379
How are you, Spratt?            

564
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:58,048
Well, I hope.                   

565
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,816
              Everyone has their
               troubles, m'lady.

566
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:01,251
     Oh, dear.                  

567
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:05,121
    Spratt has been helping     
 to train my new maid, Denker.  

568
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,624
       I'd say she takes        
  after the dachshund, m'lady.  

569
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:08,858
   In what way?                 

570
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:10,794
    She's quite untrainable.    

571
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,162
            Spratt.             

572
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:14,631
    Will there be anything else,
                  your ladyship?

573
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:21,071
                     (sighs)    

574
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:22,505
Sounds like trouble to me.      

575
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:23,940
Are you certain Denker's        
worth it?                       

576
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:27,143
Oh, you must put dinner         
on Friday into your diary.      

577
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,779
   That's when Dicky Merton's   
     coming with his sons.      

578
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:33,049
     Yes, I wonder if it is     
          a good idea.          

579
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:36,052
   Isobel's got to meet them    
           sometime.            

580
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:38,521
And Larry won't make trouble    
for Tom again.                  

581
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:40,056
Not with Sybil dead.            

582
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:41,091
        Let us hope not.        

583
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,662
   Granny, I know why you're    
    finding this difficult.     

584
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,497
            Do you?             

585
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,665
Yes.                            

586
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,999
 But you mustn't give in to it. 

587
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,301
        Give in to what?        

588
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:53,203
      Isobel's always been      
         your protégé.          

589
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:55,138
She looks up to you,            

590
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:57,073
     and you have kept her      
      from harm in return.      

591
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:59,142
                   Have I?      

592
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:01,411
Yes, so of course               
it's difficult                  

593
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:04,080
 that she is to take her place  
among the leaders of the county.

594
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:05,248
                        Oh, why?

595
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:06,583
      Why is it difficult?      

596
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:08,151
You needn't pretend.            

597
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:09,886
  Your positions have changed.  

598
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:11,754
         You, the widow         
      in the Dower House.       

599
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,791
Isobel, a great lady            

600
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:16,459
           presiding            
      over a great house.       

601
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:18,828
   But you simply have to be    
       bigger than that.        

602
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:25,201
 Is that what you think of me?  

603
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:28,371
          That I care           
   about her change of rank?    

604
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:31,341
    Well, you're not exactly    
       pleased, are you?        

605
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:33,676
              No.               

606
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:36,146
  But that is not the reason.   

607
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:38,414
         Then what is?          

608
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,916
   Well, if you must know...    

609
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:46,022
    I've got used to having     
          a companion.          

610
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:47,457
           A friend.            

611
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:49,392
       You know, someone        
   to talk things over with.    

612
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:51,227
  Well, you'll still have us.   

613
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,695
                        You have
                 your own lives,

614
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:54,330
       and so you should.       

615
00:23:55,834 --> 00:24:00,436
        But Isobel and I        
  had a lot in common, and...   

616
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:05,141
       I shall miss that.       

617
00:24:05,176 --> 00:24:06,809
Granny, you're quite dewy-eyed. 

618
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:09,212
      I never think of you      
        as sentimental.         

619
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:10,246
                   Nor am I.    

620
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,750
           You've made me regret
                  my confidence.

621
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:14,984
              Do have some cake.

622
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:17,186
       And for your information,

623
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:22,025
      I don't think Isobel      
   has ever looked up to me.    

624
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:27,096
Now, we'll drop the sticks      
in together, when I say.        

625
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,264
             Ready?             

626
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,299
              Go!               

627
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:35,271
                 Where are they?

628
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,372
There it is!                    

629
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:38,141
               It's me, it's me!

630
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:39,542
                Now make a wish.

631
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:46,015
    Darling, you know Aunt Edith
             has gone to London?

632
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:47,417
              Yes.              

633
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:49,018
            Only I was thinking.

634
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:51,888
                   And I wonder,
   what if we were to leave here

635
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:55,458
   and to go and live in a place
        far away across the sea?

636
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:56,793
             What would you say?

637
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:57,794
              Why?              

638
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,330
                Well, because...

639
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:04,267
       It might be better for us
      to start a new life there.

640
00:25:04,302 --> 00:25:06,269
              Why?              

641
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,071
                      Because...

642
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:13,776
           Because I hope to God
      I'm doing the right thing.

643
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:15,078
                 (clock chiming)

644
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:16,446
        That's the stable clock.

645
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:17,980
             We better get back.

646
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:35,031
I've got an idea                
and I've told Mrs. Hughes,      

647
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:37,233
but I want you to know it.      

648
00:25:37,268 --> 00:25:39,435
I could swear the train ticket  
hadn't been used.               

649
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:41,070
I<i> would</i> swear it.               

650
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:42,905
             What?              

651
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:44,674
I saw the ticket                
in Mrs. Hughes's hand           

652
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:45,875
when she found it               
in the coat.                    

653
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:46,909
It hadn't been                  
torn in half.                   

654
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:47,777
It was whole.                   

655
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:48,511
   I saw it.                    

656
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:50,046
        Did you indeed?         

657
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:52,248
           Things have moved on,
                    Miss Baxter.

658
00:25:52,283 --> 00:25:55,051
         They know Mr. Bates was
            in York on that day.

659
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:56,853
I just wanted                   
to be helpful.                  

660
00:25:56,888 --> 00:26:00,389
   We know how you like to be   
     helpful, Miss Baxter.      

661
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:03,126
    By talking to the police    
           about us.            

662
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:04,393
                Excuse me.      

663
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:06,629
                I couldn't help 
                overhearing.    

664
00:26:06,664 --> 00:26:09,198
                     Miss Baxter
                   won't say it,

665
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,234
           but she's            
    in a difficult position.    

666
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:13,002
        On the contrary.        

667
00:26:13,037 --> 00:26:14,270
          Miss Baxter           
        keeps saying it.        

668
00:26:14,305 --> 00:26:16,606
          She says nothing else.

669
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:17,740
        (clears throat)         

670
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:19,308
         Mr. Molesley,          
    can you remove the baize    

671
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:21,811
    from the tables, please?    

672
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:27,316
      I'm ready to go up.       

673
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:29,018
             I'll come with you.

674
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,658
                Ignore them.    

675
00:26:35,693 --> 00:26:36,826
            I can't.            

676
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:38,494
     I feel sorry for them.     

677
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,663
      Then tell them why you had
          to talk to the police.

678
00:26:40,698 --> 00:26:44,000
       I'd feel ashamed.        

679
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:48,504
        You're in luck.         

680
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,505
      I'm only just back.       

681
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:51,007
     Now, listen carefully.     

682
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:53,943
Today I learned I've been posted
on a trade delegation to Poland.

683
00:26:53,978 --> 00:26:55,978
        Oh, some people         
       have all the fun.        

684
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:57,113
              Mmm.              

685
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:58,181
    I'll be gone for months.    

686
00:26:58,216 --> 00:26:59,348
         What a shame.          

687
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:00,750
    Does that mean our plot     
           goes west?           

688
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,018
        Not necessarily.        

689
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:04,086
     I want you to come up      
      to London tomorrow.       

690
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:06,122
    I've some things I can't    
   get out of in the morning.   

691
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:07,290
     <i> That doesn't matter.</i>      

692
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:09,125
      I just need you from      
         about 7:00 on.         

693
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,593
           What for?            

694
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:12,295
    Mabel's given me an idea    
      for how to settle it      

695
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:13,829
       <i> once and for all.</i>       

696
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:14,730
         Just be here.          

697
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:17,033
     What sort of clothes?      

698
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:18,234
             Rags.              

699
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:19,468
   We're going to the Kinema.   

700
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:20,703
Ring me when you get to London. 

701
00:27:20,738 --> 00:27:22,138
    Your wish is my command.    

702
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:23,406
              Bye.              

703
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:26,309
         (gong ringing)         

704
00:27:28,479 --> 00:27:29,712
I'm worried about Isis.         

705
00:27:29,747 --> 00:27:30,980
          Why? What's the matter
                       with her?

706
00:27:31,015 --> 00:27:33,349
                         ROBERT:
   She's not looking too clever.

707
00:27:33,384 --> 00:27:34,984
Did you manage to get hold      
of Mr. Stapeley?                

708
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:36,452
      I spoke to his wife,      
            my lord.            

709
00:27:36,487 --> 00:27:37,620
         He's away until Friday.

710
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:38,955
           Do you want me to try
           to find someone else?

711
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:39,956
            No, no.             

712
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,223
I'll take her                   
down there myself               

713
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:42,224
on Friday afternoon.            

714
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,359
  Has the gong been rung yet?   

715
00:27:43,394 --> 00:27:44,293
                           Just.

716
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,428
                Why do we bother
                      to change?

717
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:46,462
                   It's you, me,
                   Mary and Tom.

718
00:27:46,497 --> 00:27:47,463
Don't let Aunt Violet           
hear you.                       

719
00:27:47,498 --> 00:27:49,131
Where have you been?            

720
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,466
I went to have tea              
with Atticus.                   

721
00:27:50,501 --> 00:27:51,634
We met halfway,                 
in Ripon.                       

722
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:53,803
          It's getting          
      quite serious, then?      

723
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,137
Fingers crossed.                

724
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,473
But darling, you don't want     
to rush into anything.          

725
00:27:57,508 --> 00:27:58,741
                   Oh, but I do.

726
00:27:58,776 --> 00:28:00,376
               I want to rush in
                   like billy-o.

727
00:28:00,411 --> 00:28:03,145
Rose, it's a big thing          
you're contemplating.           

728
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,348
Bigger still because            
of the circumstances.           

729
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:06,782
                  You sound like
                  Lord Sinderby.

730
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:08,517
I could see                     
he wasn't very keen.            

731
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:10,853
         He doesn't want Atticus
      to marry out of the faith.

732
00:28:10,888 --> 00:28:12,021
                       He minds.

733
00:28:12,056 --> 00:28:13,189
Why shouldn't he mind?          

734
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:14,924
    He's a very important figure
              in that community.

735
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:16,258
But you're not against it,      
are you?                        

736
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:17,426
                  Of course not.

737
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:19,228
        Still, I think you ought
       to write to your parents.

738
00:28:19,263 --> 00:28:21,030
Oh, Daddy won't try             
and stop me.                    

739
00:28:21,065 --> 00:28:23,032
             No, I don't believe
                        he will.

740
00:28:23,067 --> 00:28:25,034
       And Mummy hates everyone,
       so what's the difference?

741
00:28:25,069 --> 00:28:27,737
Even so, it's best              
not to pretend                  

742
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:29,772
that it'll be                   
plain sailing.                  

743
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:34,777
            (sighs)             

744
00:28:37,815 --> 00:28:39,415
     No second cups, I'm afraid.

745
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:41,417
          They shut in a minute.

746
00:28:41,452 --> 00:28:43,486
    We were just discussing     
          Mrs. Drewe,           

747
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:45,654
   whether or not she blabbed   
        to anyone else.         

748
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,323
         She says not.          

749
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:50,126
    She felt I was different    
    because I'm your mother.    

750
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:52,862
I ought to know I have          
another grandchild,             

751
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,131
     and I agree with her.      

752
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:57,400
     Where is Marigold now?     

753
00:28:57,435 --> 00:28:59,135
The hotel arranges a babysitter 
       when you need one.       

754
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,536
         May I see her?         

755
00:29:00,571 --> 00:29:01,871
       I don't think so.        

756
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:02,872
          Not tonight.          

757
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,673
ROSAMUND:                       
So what are you                 
going to do?                    

758
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:06,041
    I was toying for a while    

759
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,443
         with the idea          
      of going to America.      

760
00:29:07,478 --> 00:29:08,544
        Oh, don't be ridiculous.

761
00:29:08,579 --> 00:29:09,712
    Why is that ridiculous?     

762
00:29:09,747 --> 00:29:10,946
      She's half American,      
           isn't she?           

763
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:12,748
I thought I'd                   
drop my title                   

764
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:14,717
   and invent a dead husband.   

765
00:29:14,752 --> 00:29:18,053
     Then I'd be Mrs. Thing     
     in Detroit or Chicago,     

766
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,089
            where I wouldn't run
             into anyone I knew.

767
00:29:20,124 --> 00:29:21,624
           So is that your plan?

768
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:25,361
   I don't want the magazine    
  business to fall into ruin.   

769
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:27,630
 How could I keep an eye on it  
           overseas?            

770
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:30,699
   And I would like Marigold    
      to grow up English.       

771
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:32,201
Then what is                    
the alternative?                

772
00:29:32,236 --> 00:29:33,602
                     An invented
              dead husband here?

773
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:35,704
   I'd never get away with it   
           in London.           

774
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:39,308
     I thought I'd make her     
     my orphaned godchild.      

775
00:29:39,343 --> 00:29:42,378
 Well, I have a different plan. 

776
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:44,380
I'd like you to bring her home. 

777
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:45,648
              No.               

778
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:47,383
 I won't be the County Failure. 

779
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:48,818
                   Poor demented
                     Lady Edith,

780
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:51,086
      who lost her virtue       
        and her reason.         

781
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,955
    Just listen to my plan.     

782
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:59,028
     The Drewes would reach     
     a reluctant conclusion     

783
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:00,596
that they can't afford to raise 

784
00:30:00,631 --> 00:30:01,964
their friend's child.           

785
00:30:01,999 --> 00:30:03,465
You've grown so fond            
of the girl,                    

786
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:07,670
 you ask if she might join the  
 others in the Downton nursery. 

787
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:09,905
            Well, the Drewe plan
                 was mad enough,

788
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:12,374
     but this is completely     
           ludicrous.           

789
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:13,843
How could it                    
possibly work?                  

790
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:15,544
Papa must never know the truth. 

791
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,213
     I've thought about it,     
         I don't agree.         

792
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:19,582
While it would take time for him
    to get used to the idea,    

793
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:21,016
I believe                       
he would make it.               

794
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:22,818
   No, he'd never look at me    
     in the same way again.     

795
00:30:22,853 --> 00:30:24,386
           Very well.           

796
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:26,822
    If that's how you feel,     
    he doesn't have to know.    

797
00:30:26,857 --> 00:30:28,190
Nor Mary.                       

798
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:30,793
      I couldn't have Mary      
      queening it over me.      

799
00:30:30,828 --> 00:30:32,595
       No one has to know       
   who doesn't know already.    

800
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,263
  Your grandmother, Rosamund,   
          you and me.           

801
00:30:34,298 --> 00:30:36,699
Everyone else will be told      
the story.                      

802
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:38,200
And how would we execute        
this insanity?                  

803
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:42,438
A farmer's foster child turns up
         in the Downton nursery?

804
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:45,140
      People adopt babies       
          all the time          

805
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:46,308
from all kinds                  
of backgrounds.                 

806
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:47,476
          So you're going to try
                    and do this?

807
00:30:47,511 --> 00:30:48,777
         I'll telephone         
       Mr. Drewe tonight        

808
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:50,045
        when we get back        
       to Belgrave Square       

809
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:51,046
   and I'll ask for his help.   

810
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:53,048
    And what about his wife?    

811
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:54,550
      Let him manage her.       

812
00:30:54,585 --> 00:30:56,385
        Edith and I will go home
                       tomorrow.

813
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:59,421
   I'll ask Mr. Drewe to meet   
  the train and take Marigold.  

814
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:01,323
Then we'll discuss              
the Drewes' situation           

815
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:04,793
        with the family,        
          and at last,          

816
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:07,096
       Edith will fetch the girl

817
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:09,331
and bring her back to the house 
       in broad daylight.       

818
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:12,001
 Time to call it a day, ladies. 

819
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,936
     I couldn't agree more.     

820
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,176
                And one for you,
                   Mr. Molesley.

821
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,778
              Oh!               

822
00:31:22,813 --> 00:31:24,279
          I'm going up          
 with Lady Mary this afternoon, 

823
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:25,447
    but only for the night.     

824
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:26,782
You didn't have                 
much warning.                   

825
00:31:26,817 --> 00:31:29,385
ANNA:                           
I know, but                     
something's come up.            

826
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,487
I suppose there's no point      
in you looking in at the house. 

827
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:32,554
                  Not this time.

828
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,922
         Leave it 'til          
        Mr. Brook's left        

829
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:34,957
      and we can both go.       

830
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:37,526
     Oh, it's an invitation     
        from Mr. Mason.         

831
00:31:37,561 --> 00:31:39,028
      What, my Mr. Mason?       

832
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,429
        Your Mr. Mason.         

833
00:31:40,464 --> 00:31:41,697
      He wants you and me       

834
00:31:41,732 --> 00:31:44,099
    to come to the farm tomorrow
                   for luncheon,

835
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:46,435
     if we can get the time off.

836
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,669
     Why don't you go with them?

837
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:49,304
           I'm sure her ladyship
                  wouldn't mind.

838
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,839
       What's it to you?        

839
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:54,276
    Well, you did me a good turn
    when I'd done you a bad one.

840
00:31:54,311 --> 00:31:55,744
                  So I think you
                deserve a treat.

841
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,513
He's right,                     
it would do you good.           

842
00:31:57,548 --> 00:32:00,716
    But I've not been asked.    

843
00:32:00,751 --> 00:32:02,217
    Mr. Mason would be glad     
          to see you,           

844
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:03,552
      but would Mr. Carson      
           let us go?           

845
00:32:03,587 --> 00:32:06,822
      Oh, I think he will       
 if you allow me to handle it.  

846
00:32:06,857 --> 00:32:08,690
        He won't like it        
when we've got a big dinner on. 

847
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:11,393
  Well, just let me tell him.   

848
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,462
     After all, I'm the one     
      with the extra work.      

849
00:32:13,497 --> 00:32:15,697
           And would Miss Baxter
        be able to come with us?

850
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:17,199
             As Mr. Barrow says.

851
00:32:17,234 --> 00:32:19,001
Well, I don't see why not       
as long as you're back in time. 

852
00:32:19,036 --> 00:32:20,536
      You could go early.       

853
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:23,772
    I still don't understand    
why he'd write to Mr. Molesley. 

854
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,441
  Well, I might have mentioned  

855
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:27,176
   that he's been helping you   
        with your books.        

856
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:29,211
    You know I write to him     
         now and then.          

857
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:42,057
        Can you see him?        

858
00:32:42,092 --> 00:32:43,292
            Not yet.            

859
00:32:43,327 --> 00:32:45,594
                           CORA:
                     Oh, my God.

860
00:32:45,629 --> 00:32:46,628
         There's Mary.          

861
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:47,496
             What?              

862
00:32:47,531 --> 00:32:49,031
CORA:                           
There's Mr. Drewe.              

863
00:32:49,066 --> 00:32:49,798
What should we do?              

864
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:50,632
                 Leave it to me.

865
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:53,302
           Mr. Drewe.           

866
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:57,473
     Can you help my mother     
      with her suitcases?       

867
00:33:01,445 --> 00:33:02,911
         My sister Mary         
      is on the platform.       

868
00:33:04,381 --> 00:33:05,380
     Go to the next station     
         and come back.         

869
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:06,415
      I'll cover the cost.      

870
00:33:18,462 --> 00:33:19,428
      Hello, come on, you.      

871
00:33:19,463 --> 00:33:20,429
           That's it.           

872
00:33:20,464 --> 00:33:21,797
       Come on, darling,        
       it's just a game.        

873
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:24,833
     (train whistle blows)      

874
00:33:28,939 --> 00:33:29,905
                       So!      

875
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:30,906
         You found her.         

876
00:33:30,941 --> 00:33:31,974
I did.                          

877
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:33,442
I don't know what               
the fuss was about.             

878
00:33:33,477 --> 00:33:35,277
I just thought I'd like         
a day or two in London.         

879
00:33:35,312 --> 00:33:36,411
                      I knew it.

880
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:37,412
I said that's all it was.       

881
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:38,313
What a nonsense they made!      

882
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,948
             CORA:              
       Why are you here?        

883
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:41,316
  I'm catching the fast train   
           to London.           

884
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,317
      It's due any minute.      

885
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,318
When will you be back?          

886
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,186
         I'm not sure.          

887
00:33:44,221 --> 00:33:45,320
              Tomorrow, I think.

888
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,055
                  Don't forget  
         the dinner on Friday.  

889
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:49,925
     We have a duty to protect  
       Isobel from Larry Grey.  

890
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,927
    I don't think he'll try     
       anything, do you?        

891
00:33:51,962 --> 00:33:53,662
       Well, have a lovely time.

892
00:33:53,697 --> 00:33:54,930
        I'm sure I will.        

893
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,403
That was close.                 

894
00:34:03,073 --> 00:34:04,840
          (bell rings)          

895
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:06,742
           Have I met           
       your younger son?        

896
00:34:06,777 --> 00:34:08,377
           I remember           
         the elder one.         

897
00:34:08,412 --> 00:34:10,012
           I should think you do

898
00:34:10,047 --> 00:34:12,347
              after his outburst
                  the last time,

899
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,549
           but Larry            
       was fond of Sybil        

900
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:16,785
    and not about to welcome    
     the man who'd won her.     

901
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:19,988
Oh, let us hope the years since 
 have made him more forgiving.  

902
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:22,391
      I'm looking forward to it,
      and I think we should make

903
00:34:22,426 --> 00:34:24,459
                    no reference
         to the earlier meeting.

904
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:25,827
     How lucky I am in you.     

905
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:26,828
           I know it            

906
00:34:26,864 --> 00:34:28,163
           every time you speak.

907
00:34:28,198 --> 00:34:29,498
Flatterer.                      

908
00:34:29,533 --> 00:34:30,732
       I should be going.       

909
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:31,900
    I'll see you on Friday.     

910
00:34:31,935 --> 00:34:33,402
         I can't wait.          

911
00:34:33,437 --> 00:34:34,903
       Thank you so much        
       for my lovely tea.       

912
00:34:34,938 --> 00:34:36,204
         Not a bit.             

913
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,839
    Spratt will see you out.    

914
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:47,249
Spratt still looks              
rather down in the mouth.       

915
00:34:47,284 --> 00:34:51,753
I'm afraid the battles with     
Denker are far from resolved.   

916
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:56,024
               It's good to have
                  a moment alone

917
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,460
    to say how much I appreciate
         your kindness to Dicky.

918
00:34:58,495 --> 00:35:00,262
       I know you don't approve,

919
00:35:00,297 --> 00:35:01,329
                 which makes you
          all the more generous.

920
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:02,064
                      Thank you.

921
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:03,932
Well, it's too late             
to stop it.                     

922
00:35:03,967 --> 00:35:06,134
          How is Prince Kuragin?

923
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,370
I haven't heard                 
from him lately.                

924
00:35:08,405 --> 00:35:09,504
           Why?                 

925
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,506
      Well, I was just wondering
    how you were going to manage

926
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:13,008
               when the Princess
                finally arrives.

927
00:35:13,043 --> 00:35:15,010
      Will you receive her here?

928
00:35:15,045 --> 00:35:16,511
Well, I'm not sure.             

929
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:18,980
Since Shrimpie                  
hasn't found her yet,           

930
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:21,116
I've got time to plan.          

931
00:35:21,151 --> 00:35:22,217
                   Ah.          

932
00:35:23,253 --> 00:35:24,019
Oh!                             

933
00:35:24,054 --> 00:35:27,255
    What is it now, Spratt?     

934
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,623
      I'm sorry to bother       
         your ladyship,         

935
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:29,991
      especially when you       
         have company.          

936
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:33,728
       I'm afraid I must        
       hand in my notice.       

937
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:35,263
I have suffered                 

938
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,865
               as much as anyone

939
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:40,202
      can expect to suffer      
 in the course of their duties. 

940
00:35:40,237 --> 00:35:42,737
  I can take no more, m'lady.   

941
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:44,106
      I can take no more.       

942
00:35:47,644 --> 00:35:48,844
                   (door closes)

943
00:35:48,879 --> 00:35:50,445
        Typical Spratt.         

944
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:54,449
   He's as touchy as a beauty   
       losing her looks.        

945
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,017
    You don't think he meant it?

946
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:57,018
Well, if he did,                

947
00:35:57,054 --> 00:36:00,021
        he'd have given         
       his notice quietly       

948
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:01,990
      for a good reference      
           in return.           

949
00:36:02,025 --> 00:36:06,528
      No, no, it is simply      
 a demonstration of discontent. 

950
00:36:06,563 --> 00:36:09,331
               So you'll forgive
                   his outburst?

951
00:36:09,366 --> 00:36:11,333
   Anything rather than find    
         a new butler.          

952
00:36:11,368 --> 00:36:12,534
                      (laughing)

953
00:36:12,569 --> 00:36:14,569
        (music playing)         

954
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:29,684
             MARY:              
  Why did we have to rush out?  

955
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,819
        Now come and stand here.

956
00:36:30,854 --> 00:36:31,953
I still don't understand.       

957
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:32,988
                    You will.   

958
00:36:33,023 --> 00:36:34,356
        Do exactly as I tell you
                   and you will.

959
00:36:35,225 --> 00:36:36,157
      Kiss me.                  

960
00:36:36,193 --> 00:36:36,992
                    What?       

961
00:36:37,027 --> 00:36:38,560
         Kiss me. Now.          

962
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:44,266
                        Mary?   

963
00:36:45,702 --> 00:36:47,135
        What are you doing here?

964
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:48,637
So what did you think           
of the film?                    

965
00:36:48,672 --> 00:36:51,039
               There was no need
             to stage a tableau.

966
00:36:51,074 --> 00:36:52,974
           If you'd just told me
     I was allowed to walk away,

967
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:53,975
             then I'd have gone.

968
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:55,176
        Without any silly games.

969
00:36:55,212 --> 00:36:59,047
      But I did tell you, often,
              and you didn't go.

970
00:36:59,082 --> 00:37:01,216
            Well, I'm going now.

971
00:37:01,251 --> 00:37:02,918
     I know, and I wish you both

972
00:37:02,953 --> 00:37:04,719
such happiness, Tony,           

973
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:05,887
                    I really do.

974
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:07,255
 I don't want to hurry anyone,  

975
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:08,690
     but can we bring this      
           to an end?           

976
00:37:08,725 --> 00:37:10,625
I've had quite enough sentiment 
      from John Barrymore       

977
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:11,693
       and I'm starving.        

978
00:37:12,963 --> 00:37:13,929
                 Good-bye, Mary.

979
00:37:13,964 --> 00:37:14,963
           And good luck to you.

980
00:37:18,101 --> 00:37:20,035
     Well, I'm glad to have     
    engineered a resolution,    

981
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,937
even if I should have           
thought of it long ago.         

982
00:37:21,972 --> 00:37:24,205
He said we didn't need to do it,
              but I know we did.

983
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:25,440
          It's funny.           

984
00:37:25,475 --> 00:37:27,175
   I feel quite sad in a way.   

985
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:29,344
       But not sad enough       
       to change my mind.       

986
00:37:29,379 --> 00:37:30,845
She's nice, you know.           

987
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:32,747
She'll suit him very well.      

988
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:34,516
                 Good, I'm glad.

989
00:37:34,551 --> 00:37:36,685
                   So, what now?

990
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,687
         Shall we find ourselves
               some dinner, too?

991
00:37:38,722 --> 00:37:39,821
        Let's.                  

992
00:37:39,856 --> 00:37:41,256
We'll toast                     
the fun we've had               

993
00:37:41,291 --> 00:37:43,191
and whatever the future         
may bring us.                   

994
00:37:43,226 --> 00:37:44,926
                When are you off
                      to Poland?

995
00:37:44,961 --> 00:37:46,795
I catch the boat train          
on Monday.                      

996
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:48,797
So I'm scrambling around,       
trying to get everything done.  

997
00:37:48,832 --> 00:37:50,532
              When are you back?

998
00:37:50,567 --> 00:37:52,467
Not for months,                 
or even a year.                 

999
00:37:52,502 --> 00:37:54,169
You'll be married by then.      

1000
00:37:57,841 --> 00:37:58,973
             There.             

1001
00:37:59,009 --> 00:38:00,241
       You all finished?        

1002
00:38:01,845 --> 00:38:03,078
How lovely, Daisy,              

1003
00:38:03,113 --> 00:38:04,446
to have such a beautiful        
place to come to.               

1004
00:38:04,481 --> 00:38:07,282
Oh, she's always welcome,       
is Daisy.                       

1005
00:38:07,317 --> 00:38:09,084
   I've not been here enough    
            lately.             

1006
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,786
   You've been busy, I know,    
        with your books.        

1007
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:13,021
That takes up time.             

1008
00:38:13,056 --> 00:38:14,689
   I think I'll stop it now,    

1009
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:16,257
                 so I'll be able
                  to visit more.

1010
00:38:16,293 --> 00:38:18,226
Do you think she's right to     
give up her studies, Mr. Mason? 

1011
00:38:18,261 --> 00:38:20,628
           I do not!            

1012
00:38:20,664 --> 00:38:22,364
         Don't you want         
       to see more of me?       

1013
00:38:22,399 --> 00:38:23,631
         You know I do.         

1014
00:38:23,667 --> 00:38:25,800
But education is power.         

1015
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:27,135
              Don't forget that.

1016
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:29,070
        There's no limit        
    to what you can achieve     

1017
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:31,172
      if you'll just give       
         a year or two          

1018
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:32,674
   to mastering those books.    

1019
00:38:32,709 --> 00:38:34,409
I agree, Mr. Mason.             

1020
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:38,813
    There are millions out there
    who could have done so much,

1021
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:41,783
       if they'd only been given
                   an education.

1022
00:38:41,818 --> 00:38:42,951
             I'm one of them.   

1023
00:38:42,986 --> 00:38:44,786
     I could have made something
          worthwhile of my life,

1024
00:38:44,821 --> 00:38:45,820
          if I'd had the chance.

1025
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:48,389
   Don't talk as if your life   
      were not worthwhile,      

1026
00:38:48,425 --> 00:38:50,191
       when I know it is.       

1027
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:51,659
                          DAISY:
        But I think the system's

1028
00:38:51,695 --> 00:38:52,927
slanted against us,             

1029
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:55,730
     that the men in charge will
    always be the men in charge.

1030
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:58,199
   How can you say that with    
 a Labour government in power?  

1031
00:38:58,235 --> 00:38:59,367
 I doubt they'll last the year. 

1032
00:38:59,402 --> 00:39:02,036
        Well, next time         
     when they're elected,      

1033
00:39:02,072 --> 00:39:03,404
      it'll be for longer,      

1034
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,709
and soon, a Labour government   
might seem quite ordinary.      

1035
00:39:07,744 --> 00:39:09,110
          Do you think          
     I should stick at it?      

1036
00:39:09,146 --> 00:39:10,712
             I do.              

1037
00:39:10,747 --> 00:39:12,180
And now we ought                
to think about                  

1038
00:39:12,215 --> 00:39:13,515
getting you                     
back to the bus.                

1039
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:14,883
Let me take these.              

1040
00:39:14,918 --> 00:39:17,819
No, no, Daisy and I             
are your hosts.                 

1041
00:39:17,854 --> 00:39:18,887
           Thank you.           

1042
00:39:18,922 --> 00:39:19,988
                Well, thank you.

1043
00:39:27,364 --> 00:39:31,166
He's made a daughter out of     
his widowed daughter-in-law.    

1044
00:39:31,201 --> 00:39:35,003
I like it when good things      
come from bad.                  

1045
00:39:35,038 --> 00:39:37,372
                Have you thought
      of explaining to Mr. Bates

1046
00:39:37,407 --> 00:39:39,407
       why you had to speak out?

1047
00:39:39,442 --> 00:39:41,643
                 He'd understand
                if anyone would.

1048
00:39:41,678 --> 00:39:44,212
He's troubles enough            
without burdening him with mine.

1049
00:39:45,215 --> 00:39:46,381
We should go.                   

1050
00:39:46,416 --> 00:39:48,483
We must be back in good time    
for Mrs. Crawley's dinner.      

1051
00:39:48,518 --> 00:39:50,585
        Mr. Carson says         
       there was trouble        

1052
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,921
     the last time Lord Merton's
      elder son came to Downton.

1053
00:39:52,956 --> 00:39:54,422
             Why? What happened?

1054
00:39:54,457 --> 00:39:57,959
 Alfred told me if Mr. Branson  
hadn't been too drunk to stand, 

1055
00:39:57,994 --> 00:40:00,128
we'd have had fisticuffs        
on the table.                   

1056
00:40:00,163 --> 00:40:01,262
              Hey!              

1057
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:03,231
And here's me thinking life     
in a great house                

1058
00:40:03,266 --> 00:40:04,799
must be dull work.              

1059
00:40:04,834 --> 00:40:05,967
           (laughing)           

1060
00:40:06,002 --> 00:40:07,402
Walk on.                        

1061
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,173
                           MARY:
           Do Mr. and Mrs. Drewe

1062
00:40:12,208 --> 00:40:14,175
               really want you  
                  to take her?  

1063
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:15,610
      Or is it just a way       
      of keeping her here       

1064
00:40:15,645 --> 00:40:16,911
   until they have her back?    

1065
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:17,946
       I don't think so.        

1066
00:40:17,981 --> 00:40:19,280
    They simply can't afford    
         another child.         

1067
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,549
        And there aren't        
       any prior claims?        

1068
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:22,917
Apparently not.                 

1069
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:25,286
That's why they took her        
in the first place.             

1070
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:27,121
        What did he say?        

1071
00:40:27,157 --> 00:40:28,856
Is she carrying puppies?        

1072
00:40:28,892 --> 00:40:30,692
    Because I don't see how     
   that could have happened.    

1073
00:40:30,727 --> 00:40:31,793
No, it's not that.              

1074
00:40:31,828 --> 00:40:34,162
       She's got cancer,        
        poor old thing.         

1075
00:40:34,197 --> 00:40:35,430
                           CORA:
                         Oh, no!

1076
00:40:35,465 --> 00:40:37,865
         Oh, how I hate         
           that word.           

1077
00:40:37,901 --> 00:40:40,401
                He said it won't
                  take long now.

1078
00:40:40,437 --> 00:40:42,170
He offered to put her down      
there and then,                 

1079
00:40:42,205 --> 00:40:43,638
                        but I...

1080
00:40:43,673 --> 00:40:45,173
       I couldn't quite let him.

1081
00:40:45,208 --> 00:40:46,874
MARY:                           
Oh, Papa.                       

1082
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:48,076
              I am so, so sorry.

1083
00:40:48,111 --> 00:40:49,277
Of course                       
we're stupid                    

1084
00:40:49,312 --> 00:40:50,345
                to mind so much.

1085
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,746
            She probably doesn't
              even know who I am

1086
00:40:51,781 --> 00:40:53,047
                 beyond the hand
                 that feeds her.

1087
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:54,949
But even so...                  

1088
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:56,584
                           CORA:
                  We'll keep her
                     right here.

1089
00:40:56,619 --> 00:40:57,919
               This is her spot.

1090
00:40:57,954 --> 00:40:59,988
She'll know she's               
back at home.                   

1091
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:04,826
         I suppose we can't stop
    this ghastly dinner tonight?

1092
00:41:04,861 --> 00:41:06,094
I don't see how.                

1093
00:41:06,129 --> 00:41:07,762
Dicky's sons                    
have come from London.          

1094
00:41:09,065 --> 00:41:10,765
          And Atticus           
     was on the same train.     

1095
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,933
         No, of course          
      we can't put it off.      

1096
00:41:11,968 --> 00:41:12,834
       I wasn't thinking.       

1097
00:41:12,869 --> 00:41:13,835
                Why don't we say
                that you're ill?

1098
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:14,702
    I could watch her.          

1099
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:15,703
    I don't have to go          
      to the dinner.            

1100
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:17,038
                 I think you do.

1101
00:41:17,073 --> 00:41:19,707
    To lay the ghost of the last
       time Larry Grey was here.

1102
00:41:24,214 --> 00:41:25,646
I asked them                    
to bring them down early.       

1103
00:41:25,682 --> 00:41:26,647
                         SYBBIE:
                   Hello, Daddy.

1104
00:41:26,683 --> 00:41:28,015
          Come to Mama, darling.

1105
00:41:28,051 --> 00:41:29,884
Hello, my darling.              

1106
00:41:33,056 --> 00:41:35,022
    So, how should I answer?    

1107
00:41:35,058 --> 00:41:37,425
       What's this about?       

1108
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,926
           The child            
     at the Drewes' house.      

1109
00:41:38,962 --> 00:41:40,161
            (sighs)             

1110
00:41:40,196 --> 00:41:41,863
    It seems idiotic to me.     

1111
00:41:41,898 --> 00:41:43,564
                           MARY:
                         And me.

1112
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,600
     What about if you want     
 to start a family of your own? 

1113
00:41:45,635 --> 00:41:47,135
       But I dote on her.       

1114
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:49,470
        If they send her        
   to some horrid orphanage,    

1115
00:41:49,506 --> 00:41:50,671
   I'd never forgive myself.    

1116
00:41:50,707 --> 00:41:52,173
       But can't you just       
      give them some money      

1117
00:41:52,208 --> 00:41:54,041
           so they can keep her?

1118
00:41:54,077 --> 00:41:57,078
     I think... Mrs. Drewe      

1119
00:41:57,113 --> 00:41:58,646
finds it too much.              

1120
00:41:58,681 --> 00:42:00,715
        It isn't only the money.

1121
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:02,350
    That seems a bit feeble.    

1122
00:42:02,385 --> 00:42:03,151
      Does it?                  

1123
00:42:03,186 --> 00:42:04,152
Looking at these two?           

1124
00:42:04,187 --> 00:42:05,186
            (laughs)            

1125
00:42:06,356 --> 00:42:08,856
     So should I take her?      

1126
00:42:08,892 --> 00:42:10,591
             Papa?              

1127
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:15,429
   I leave it to your mother.   

1128
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,866
        Well, I believe         
        we should offer         

1129
00:42:18,902 --> 00:42:20,768
                 little Marigold
                    a home here.

1130
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:21,969
    Do you really, darling?     

1131
00:42:24,574 --> 00:42:28,109
            Well, then I suppose
                 that's settled.

1132
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:35,283
(knocking)                      

1133
00:42:35,318 --> 00:42:37,485
             Have all the guests
                        arrived?

1134
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,320
          I think so.           

1135
00:42:39,355 --> 00:42:41,756
  Oh, I should tell Mrs. Patmore
      that it won't be long now.

1136
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:44,859
Lady Mary was saying            
Lady Edith's going to adopt     

1137
00:42:44,894 --> 00:42:46,327
that little girl                
the Drewes had taken in.        

1138
00:42:46,362 --> 00:42:49,630
Well, I don't know              
if she'll adopt her,            

1139
00:42:49,666 --> 00:42:51,365
but she's bringing her          
here to live.                   

1140
00:42:51,401 --> 00:42:53,668
          Is she now?           

1141
00:42:53,703 --> 00:42:54,869
What are these?                 

1142
00:42:54,904 --> 00:42:58,506
   Oh, Mr. Carson's got a notion
      he and I might buy a place

1143
00:42:58,541 --> 00:43:00,508
                as an investment

1144
00:43:00,543 --> 00:43:02,343
                and maybe run it
                as a guest house

1145
00:43:02,378 --> 00:43:04,111
                 or rent it out.

1146
00:43:04,147 --> 00:43:05,279
How strange.                    

1147
00:43:05,315 --> 00:43:07,782
Mr. Bates was talking about     
doing something similar.        

1148
00:43:07,817 --> 00:43:11,152
   I suppose we're all beginning
 to think of a different future,

1149
00:43:11,187 --> 00:43:12,520
      whether we want to or not.

1150
00:43:13,656 --> 00:43:16,591
Mr. Drewe was on the platform   
the other day,                  

1151
00:43:16,626 --> 00:43:18,659
when Lady Mary and I were       
waiting for the London train.   

1152
00:43:18,695 --> 00:43:19,927
               Oh, yes?         

1153
00:43:19,963 --> 00:43:22,530
Then her ladyship               
and Lady Edith arrived          

1154
00:43:22,565 --> 00:43:25,199
and he got                      
into their carriage.            

1155
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:28,269
He helped lift their bags out,  
but then he just stayed there.  

1156
00:43:28,304 --> 00:43:29,503
                 In First Class?

1157
00:43:29,539 --> 00:43:31,005
                             Oh!

1158
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,641
           That'll have cost him
                 a pretty penny.

1159
00:43:33,676 --> 00:43:35,409
When the train moved off,       

1160
00:43:35,445 --> 00:43:37,712
I thought for a moment          
he had a child on his lap.      

1161
00:43:37,747 --> 00:43:39,180
I may have been wrong...        

1162
00:43:39,215 --> 00:43:40,548
                    Anna.       

1163
00:43:40,583 --> 00:43:42,383
                   You shouldn't
                involve yourself

1164
00:43:42,418 --> 00:43:45,186
              in any speculation
                   of that sort.

1165
00:43:45,221 --> 00:43:48,689
               The child is safe
         and the child is loved,

1166
00:43:48,725 --> 00:43:50,658
          and that's all we need
                  to be sure of.

1167
00:43:55,965 --> 00:43:57,331
                         ISOBEL:
               I've been hearing
             about Edith's plan.

1168
00:43:57,367 --> 00:43:59,533
     How marvelous of her.      

1169
00:43:59,569 --> 00:44:01,569
If you ask me,                  
it's absolutely crackers.       

1170
00:44:01,604 --> 00:44:03,604
But Cora seems pleased.         

1171
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:04,905
              What idea is this?

1172
00:44:04,941 --> 00:44:06,841
       Edith has taken in       
       a motherless child       

1173
00:44:06,876 --> 00:44:09,143
       and is giving her        
          a home here.          

1174
00:44:09,178 --> 00:44:10,311
I should have thought           
an orphan                       

1175
00:44:10,346 --> 00:44:12,313
         rather an uncomfortable
                piece of baggage

1176
00:44:12,348 --> 00:44:13,581
         for an unmarried woman.

1177
00:44:13,616 --> 00:44:15,316
ISOBEL:                         
You mean a man                  
might not want                  

1178
00:44:15,351 --> 00:44:16,550
     to take the child on?      

1179
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:18,919
            Well, I wouldn't.   

1180
00:44:20,957 --> 00:44:23,391
  Rose, have you written to your
      mother about Mr. Aldridge?

1181
00:44:23,426 --> 00:44:25,059
                     I have now.

1182
00:44:25,094 --> 00:44:26,427
           And will she approve?

1183
00:44:26,462 --> 00:44:28,462
         Don't be disappointing,
                    Aunt Violet,

1184
00:44:28,498 --> 00:44:29,864
please.                         

1185
00:44:29,899 --> 00:44:31,832
  I promise you, we both know   
    a difference in religion    

1186
00:44:31,868 --> 00:44:33,534
                 is a big thing.

1187
00:44:33,569 --> 00:44:34,869
          Quite right.          

1188
00:44:34,904 --> 00:44:36,570
     How would you bring up     
   any children, for example?   

1189
00:44:36,606 --> 00:44:38,005
           Children?            

1190
00:44:38,041 --> 00:44:39,774
     When did this happen?      

1191
00:44:39,809 --> 00:44:40,775
           (laughter)           

1192
00:44:40,810 --> 00:44:41,909
  I'm talking hypothetically.   

1193
00:44:41,944 --> 00:44:43,677
          The fact is,          
    most marriages that fail    

1194
00:44:43,713 --> 00:44:45,946
founder for precisely           
this kind of reason.            

1195
00:44:45,982 --> 00:44:48,382
               An irreconcilable
                     difference.

1196
00:44:48,418 --> 00:44:51,619
       Or maybe they just       
         don't get on.          

1197
00:44:51,654 --> 00:44:53,154
TIM:                            
I'd agree with Larry.           

1198
00:44:53,189 --> 00:44:54,321
    It's usually more than that.

1199
00:44:54,357 --> 00:44:55,656
LARRY:                          
Oh, it might be                 

1200
00:44:55,691 --> 00:44:57,391
       different beliefs        

1201
00:44:57,427 --> 00:44:58,959
or different                    
nationalities                   

1202
00:44:58,995 --> 00:45:00,728
              or a huge age gap.

1203
00:45:00,763 --> 00:45:02,763
          In the end,           
  they cannot see eye to eye.   

1204
00:45:02,799 --> 00:45:04,398
          I don't see           
    what you're getting at.     

1205
00:45:04,434 --> 00:45:05,666
       You mean to marry        
       Mrs. Crawley here.       

1206
00:45:05,701 --> 00:45:08,702
            She seems very nice,
             and I wish you both

1207
00:45:08,738 --> 00:45:10,404
        every happiness.        

1208
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,839
Thank you.                      

1209
00:45:11,874 --> 00:45:14,608
        But that doesn't        
     prevent me from seeing     

1210
00:45:14,644 --> 00:45:16,710
         that the wide disparity
         in class and background

1211
00:45:16,746 --> 00:45:18,112
may prove your undoing.         

1212
00:45:19,148 --> 00:45:20,114
       What did you say?        

1213
00:45:20,149 --> 00:45:21,315
         Only that Mrs. Crawley,

1214
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:22,783
                       a decent,
              middle-class woman

1215
00:45:22,819 --> 00:45:24,952
              with neither birth
                    nor fortune,

1216
00:45:24,987 --> 00:45:27,321
is expecting to fill            
our mother's shoes              

1217
00:45:27,356 --> 00:45:29,557
           as one of the leaders
                  of the county.

1218
00:45:29,592 --> 00:45:31,392
           Is she capable of it?

1219
00:45:31,427 --> 00:45:33,527
  Or will her inevitable failure

1220
00:45:33,563 --> 00:45:35,229
        prove a source of misery
                   to them both?

1221
00:45:35,264 --> 00:45:37,498
ROBERT:                         
You know Mrs. Crawley's         
late son was my heir?           

1222
00:45:37,533 --> 00:45:38,666
           What does that prove?

1223
00:45:38,701 --> 00:45:41,335
    Everyone has distant cousins
             who are fairly odd.

1224
00:45:42,238 --> 00:45:43,571
         How dare you!          

1225
00:45:43,606 --> 00:45:45,005
      Will you go, Larry?       

1226
00:45:46,476 --> 00:45:48,209
I had to make excuses           
for your rudeness               

1227
00:45:48,244 --> 00:45:49,944
           the last time you sat
                  at this table.

1228
00:45:51,547 --> 00:45:53,514
It is tiring to think I shall be
  called upon to do so again.   

1229
00:45:53,549 --> 00:45:55,683
  I know the choice of in-laws  
  is eccentric in this family.  

1230
00:45:55,718 --> 00:45:57,017
               You already boast
                     a chauffeur

1231
00:45:57,053 --> 00:45:59,420
   and soon you can claim a Jew,
                  but even so...

1232
00:45:59,455 --> 00:46:01,522
Why don't you just              
get out, you bastard!           

1233
00:46:01,557 --> 00:46:02,857
                         VIOLET:
      And suddenly we've slipped

1234
00:46:02,892 --> 00:46:04,191
into a foreign tongue.          

1235
00:46:07,396 --> 00:46:09,063
             Well.              

1236
00:46:09,098 --> 00:46:12,066
        If that is how you feel.

1237
00:46:12,101 --> 00:46:13,300
I do not endorse Tom's language 

1238
00:46:13,336 --> 00:46:14,969
     but that is certainly      
        how we all feel.        

1239
00:46:18,341 --> 00:46:20,441
Then, Lady Grantham, good-bye.  

1240
00:46:22,245 --> 00:46:24,245
         And thank you          
   for a delightful evening.    

1241
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,419
                   (door closes)

1242
00:46:36,259 --> 00:46:37,992
           What did you imagine?

1243
00:46:38,027 --> 00:46:40,027
       That we would welcome you
                 with open arms?

1244
00:46:45,167 --> 00:46:46,433
                     He actually
                called him that?

1245
00:46:46,469 --> 00:46:48,569
                     He did,    
          right to his face!    

1246
00:46:49,472 --> 00:46:50,804
           Mr. Molesley, please.

1247
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,273
      I think he was right      
           to say it.           

1248
00:46:52,308 --> 00:46:53,774
He may have been right,         

1249
00:46:53,809 --> 00:46:55,342
but I will not have bad language
in front of the maids.          

1250
00:46:55,378 --> 00:46:56,710
I feel very sorry               
for Mrs. Crawley.               

1251
00:46:56,746 --> 00:46:58,345
Why should she be               
humiliated?                     

1252
00:46:58,381 --> 00:46:59,980
     They're leaving early.     

1253
00:47:00,016 --> 00:47:02,149
And no wonder.                  

1254
00:47:02,184 --> 00:47:03,083
  (giggling)                    

1255
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:04,752
         Mr. Molesley,          
     why are you down here?     

1256
00:47:04,787 --> 00:47:06,086
     Not gossiping, I hope?     

1257
00:47:06,122 --> 00:47:07,621
          Oh, no, no,           
        Mr. Carson, no.         

1258
00:47:10,626 --> 00:47:12,593
         Golly, what an evening.

1259
00:47:12,628 --> 00:47:14,528
              We won't forget it
                     in a hurry.

1260
00:47:14,563 --> 00:47:16,530
       Let us remember it       
        for two reasons.        

1261
00:47:16,565 --> 00:47:17,598
              One bad, one good.

1262
00:47:17,633 --> 00:47:18,832
Oh, what's the good one?        

1263
00:47:18,868 --> 00:47:20,000
        Well, I hope it is good.

1264
00:47:20,036 --> 00:47:21,635
I'm listening.                  

1265
00:47:21,671 --> 00:47:22,770
              See, the thing is,

1266
00:47:22,805 --> 00:47:23,871
      it occurs to me that      

1267
00:47:23,906 --> 00:47:25,205
      we're already having      
      to defend ourselves.      

1268
00:47:25,241 --> 00:47:26,607
              Yes.              

1269
00:47:26,642 --> 00:47:27,875
         So let's have          
       a real reason to.        

1270
00:47:29,512 --> 00:47:31,478
            That is,            
    if you feel equal to it.    

1271
00:47:31,514 --> 00:47:33,180
         I'm not going          
     to give you an answer      

1272
00:47:33,215 --> 00:47:34,381
   until you say it properly.   

1273
00:47:34,417 --> 00:47:36,183
    Do I have to kneel down?    

1274
00:47:36,218 --> 00:47:37,217
           Of course!           

1275
00:47:37,253 --> 00:47:38,585
But you don't have              
to stay kneeling                

1276
00:47:38,621 --> 00:47:39,586
for very long.                  

1277
00:47:39,622 --> 00:47:41,588
             Rose.              

1278
00:47:41,624 --> 00:47:43,857
                   Darling Rose.

1279
00:47:43,893 --> 00:47:45,559
       Will you marry me?       

1280
00:47:46,829 --> 00:47:47,795
      You can get up now.       

1281
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:48,796
                    Well, go on.

1282
00:47:48,831 --> 00:47:49,797
    We ought to be serious.     

1283
00:47:49,832 --> 00:47:51,532
The truth is that               

1284
00:47:51,567 --> 00:47:53,067
        we haven't known        
     each other very long,      

1285
00:47:53,102 --> 00:47:54,368
and they're right
