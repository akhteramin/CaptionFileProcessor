00:29:24,926 --> 00:29:25,993
 When I received the diagnosis, 

713
00:29:26,028 --> 00:29:27,678
   I knew, whatever it takes,   

714
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:30,347
  wherever I have to go... I'm  
         beating this.          

715
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,649
   Breast cancer treatment is   
     continuing to evolve.      

716
00:29:32,685 --> 00:29:36,303
 CTCA is definitely on the cusp 
       of those changes.        

717
00:29:36,322 --> 00:29:38,238
 We really focus on taking the  
             time               

718
00:29:38,274 --> 00:29:39,690
 with each individual patient   

719
00:29:39,742 --> 00:29:42,576
so they can choose the treatment
     appropriate for them.      

720
00:29:42,611 --> 00:29:44,328
 I empower women with choices.  

721
00:29:44,363 --> 00:29:45,912
    It's not just picking a     
           surgeon.             

722
00:29:45,948 --> 00:29:50,650
It's picking the care team, and 
 feeling secure where you are.
