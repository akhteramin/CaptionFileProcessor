2
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,007
                     Hey, honey.

3
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:27,092
       Whoa, whoa, whoa.        
      What are you doing?

     she can put her stuff      
         on your desk.          

7
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:35,684
      Well, what if I have      
        to tell a story?        

8
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,019
     I talk with my hands.      

9

 That's how I paint a picture.  

10
00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:44,610
       Okay, well, maybe paint a
    picture of you working. Hmm?

11
00:00:44,695 --> 00:00:45,861
   It'll be a one-of-a-kind.    

12
00:00:45,946 --> 00:00:47,112
                 Come on, honey,

13
00:00:47,164 --> 00:00:49,031
                you can put your
                stuff over here.

14
00:00:49,116 --> 00:00:52,284

but, you know, I work here now; 

15
00:00:52,369 --> 00:00:54,787
I feel like I should            
have my own desk.               

16
00:00:54,872 --> 00:00:57,122
            I wish we could, but
          if we give you a desk,

17
00:00:57,174 --> 00:00:59,508
           someone else is gonna
         have to give theirs up.

21

       to earn this desk?

31

           Hey, nobody's        
       gonna take your desk.    

32
00:01:33,244 --> 00:01:35,544

00:05:04,955 --> 00:05:07,372

00:05:28,312 --> 00:05:30,395
            I know.             

116
00:05:32,316 --> 00:05:33,482
          I remember.           

117
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:35,734
           I listen.            

118
00:05:39,156 --> 00:05:42,107
 But shouldn't you do this one? 
       I mean, last night       

119
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:45,410
    I had to clean dog poop     
   off of Emme's shoe,<i> again.</i>   

120
00:05:45,462 --> 00:05:46,495
                     I think she

121
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,164
 just jumps from pile to pile.  

122
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:51,633
Well, while you                 

123
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:54,419
    were cleaning her shoes,    
  I hemmed Kate's band uniform  

124
00:05:54,471 --> 00:05:56,287
      to make it shorter.       

125
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,123
            Longer.             

126
00:05:58,175 --> 00:06:01,093
       I made it longer,        
        like a pilgrim.         

127
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:03,812
                      All right,

128
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:05,931
        forget Lowell--         
   I'll do the solar system.    

129
00:06:05,983 --> 00:06:07,983
      I already got it all      
   planned out, because I've    

130
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:10,685
 been thinking about ever since 
  you mentioned it last week.   

131
00:06:12,356 --> 00:06:15,323
    No. I like that you want    
  to go check on your friend,   

132
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:17,659
 so I will create the universe. 

133
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:20,862
A woman probably did it anyway. 

134
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:22,531
  Man, you guys are too busy.   

135
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:25,500
The only thing I did last night 
was binge-watch<i> Fantasy Island.</i> 

136
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:26,668
           And all I can say is,

137
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:28,703
 be careful what you wish for.  

138
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,160
                Heh. That sounds
              like a night, huh?
         Hmm.                   

139
00:06:35,212 --> 00:06:36,995
    Mindless, pointless fun?    

140
00:06:37,047 --> 00:06:39,297
Do you remember                 
how much fun fun was?           

141
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:41,850
                    Yeah.       

142
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:43,969
           You know, sometimes I
         see old pictures of us,

143
00:06:44,054 --> 00:06:47,139
           and I think: What are
             they smiling about?

144
00:06:47,191 --> 00:06:48,640
                 Don't they know
                  what's coming?

145
00:06:48,692 --> 00:06:50,058
         Right?                 

146
00:06:50,144 --> 00:06:52,144
            LOWELL:             
  <i> I'm so glad you dropped by.</i>  

147
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:53,812
             Yeah.              

148
00:06:53,897 --> 00:06:56,231
               Let me just close
                my bedroom door.

149
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:02,904
Well, now the place             
looks huge.                     

150
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,157
Can you hear me over there?     

151
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:07,159
                  Sit down, make
               yourself at home.

152
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,329
                     (sighs)    

153
00:07:14,718 --> 00:07:16,885
                   This is cozy.
                      (chuckles)

154
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,888
The saleslady at the store      
said it was a love seat.        

155
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:23,208
Then I said,                    
"I love you, too."              

156
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,843
 Then I kind of                 
<i> had</i> to buy it.                 

157
00:07:24,895 --> 00:07:27,012
               Look, Lowell,    

158
00:07:27,097 --> 00:07:30,065
  I know you're going through   
      a tough time, but...      

159
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:33,568
     your mood is creating      
       a weird work vibe.       

160
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:36,188
       Is it the crying?        
          The yelling?          

161
00:07:36,273 --> 00:07:38,857
I think it's the combo platter, 
           my friend.           

162
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:40,025
Oh, come on,                    

163
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,243
       it's not all bad.        

164
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:42,911
You got your own place here.    

165
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:44,763
You could do whatever you want. 

166
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,064
           Like what?           

167
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:49,801
That is a great question.       

168
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,120
 Uh, well, what were you doing  
       before I got here?       

169
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:53,872
     Well, I open and close     
         the bed a lot.         

170
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,959
       (knocking at door)       
        Fun. (chuckles)         

171
00:07:59,263 --> 00:08:00,962
Hey, Don. Don's here.           

172
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:02,597
He'll lighten things up.        

173
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:04,216
    Don, lighten things up.     

174
00:08:04,268 --> 00:08:06,218
             What brings you by,
                  fair traveler?

175
00:08:06,303 --> 00:08:08,720
       Well, I went home,       
 and you know what I realized?  

176
00:08:08,772 --> 00:08:09,938
      My wife lives there.      

177
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:11,556
                      So, I, uh,

178
00:08:11,608 --> 00:08:13,558
 grabbed some beer and snacks,  
         and here I am.         

179
00:08:13,644 --> 00:08:15,777
          See, Lowell?          
   It's all coming together.    

180
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,145
We got food,                    
we got beverages.               

181
00:08:17,231 --> 00:08:21,233
Now we just need something      
to do... besides talking.       

182
00:08:21,285 --> 00:08:24,235
Hey. What's this hole?          

183
00:08:24,288 --> 00:08:27,072
  I tried to hang a picture, but
    I was madder than I thought.

184
00:08:27,124 --> 00:08:29,457
        Well, I think we        
  can do something with that.   

185
00:08:29,543 --> 00:08:31,493
           That's my light bill.

186
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:33,495
       No, no, we'll make       
      a game out of this.       

187
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,498
   Okay, if you get the ball    
     in the hole from here,     

188
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:39,417
       that's one point.        
 And if you make it from here,  
        it's two points.        

189
00:08:39,503 --> 00:08:40,752
        Ah.                     
                      And if you

190
00:08:40,804 --> 00:08:43,755
          don't get in the hole,
                 it's no points.

191
00:08:43,807 --> 00:08:46,308
           All right,           
   I like that you're trying.   

192
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:51,012
              Yes!              

193
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:53,765
       Nothin' but hole.        

194
00:08:53,817 --> 00:08:55,517
                 This is so fun!

195
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:58,687
    But we lost the ball;       
      now what do we do?        
                  Dang it, Adam!

196
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:08,446
     Automatic ball return.     

197
00:09:08,498 --> 00:09:11,616
Gentlemen, I think              
we just invented a sport.       

198
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,120
This is a masterpiece.          

199
00:09:15,205 --> 00:09:18,623
 This is definitely gonna make  
 the front table at open house. 

200
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:20,675
          (chuckles):           
      Yeah. It looks good.      

201
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:22,961
So, is it time to paint Uranus? 

202
00:09:27,017 --> 00:09:29,351
       Teddy, you've been       
     doing that all night.      

203
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:30,802
    You're right. I'm sorry.    

204
00:09:30,887 --> 00:09:33,054
     (sighs) But Uranus has     
      a weird bump on it.       

205
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:36,524
            Miss it.            

206
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:37,642
         Miss it. Mi...         

207
00:09:37,694 --> 00:09:38,810
                 Yes!           
                    (groans)    

208
00:09:38,862 --> 00:09:40,812
      (chuckles)                

209
00:09:40,864 --> 00:09:42,313
    What are you doing, Don?    
        Follow through!         

210
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,866
All right, good game.           

211
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,868
       I should get going       
 and help with Teddy's project. 

212
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:48,370
I'm glad you're                 
feeling better, Lowell.         

213
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:49,704
This was surprisingly fun.      

214
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,989
         It really was.         

215
00:09:51,074 --> 00:09:52,874
  I mean, you invented a game   

216
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,210
you can only play               
in my apartment.                
              Mm-hmm.           

217
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:56,544
     That makes me the hub.     

218
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,546
   I'm the hub of the wheel.    

219
00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:01,082
                You can't leave.
             I demand a rematch.

220
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:04,252
Well, I would, because I am at  
the peak of my athletic ability,

221
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,221
but I should get home.          

222
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:07,922
                      Okay, then
                       tomorrow.
                     Well...    

223
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:10,175
         Andi's not gonna let me
             come back tomorrow.

224
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,676
    I have responsibilities.    

225
00:10:11,728 --> 00:10:13,428
         Who knows what         
     she told me last week      

226
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:14,896
       that I'm supposed        
        to do tomorrow?         

227
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:18,566
        Okay, fine. Then        
 we'll-we'll play without you.  

228
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:19,934
             What?              

229
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,187
     You're gonna have fun      
          without me?           

230
00:10:22,272 --> 00:10:23,354
               Probably more.   

231
00:10:24,408 --> 00:10:27,575
All you really need is the hub. 

232
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:29,194
                          But...

233
00:10:29,246 --> 00:10:31,112
    but I invented the game.    

234
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:34,032
            Well, we'll put up a
         picture in your memory.

235
00:10:34,084 --> 00:10:36,418
                     No, no, no.
                I'm coming back.

236
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:39,287
I just have to figure out a way 
     to work it with Andi.      

237
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:40,872
 She only let me come down here 

238
00:10:40,924 --> 00:10:42,373
        because Lowell's        
      such a basket case.       

239
00:10:43,927 --> 00:10:45,877
            Thanks.             

240
00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:47,796
      Oh. No, that's a...       
      that's a good thing.      

241
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:49,047
        I can use that.         

242
00:10:49,099 --> 00:10:50,381
    Oh. Then you're welcome.    

243
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,552
So, how's Lowell doing?         

244
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:56,104
    It is no fun over there,    

245
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:57,555
        let me tell ya.         

246
00:10:58,975 --> 00:11:01,643
           I even had           
    to bring Don in to help.    

247
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:04,229
And Lowell wants me to come back
     again tomorrow, but...     

248
00:11:04,281 --> 00:11:06,064
Hmm.                            
      I couldn't do that.       

249
00:11:06,116 --> 00:11:08,233
            Could I?            

250
00:11:08,285 --> 00:11:10,985
   Maybe you should bring him   
           over here.           

251
00:11:14,991 --> 00:11:18,460
       That... is an idea       
     I did not see coming.      

252
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,414
          Oh, but, no,          
   I'm afraid it'd remind him   

253
00:11:23,467 --> 00:11:25,800
         of everything          
       he used to have...       

254
00:11:27,637 --> 00:11:29,420
         You know what?         
         He'll be fine.         

255
00:11:29,506 --> 00:11:31,256
       The hell with him.       
Oh, no, no.                     

256
00:11:31,308 --> 00:11:33,308

   I mean, he's your friend.    

257
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:36,261
 You need to be there for him.  
  You should go back tomorrow.

260
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:44,102
         fine, I'll go.         

261
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:48,690

00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:37,438
I'm gonna go find a church      
and get some soup.              

351
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,911
What happened?                  
I thought he was better.        

352
00:17:43,997 --> 00:17:48,249
 Looks like I'm gonna have to go
  back over there again tonight.

353
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:50,451
            (groans)            

354
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,620
      You know what, Adam?      
      I don't believe you.      

355
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:55,122
           You don't?           

356
00:17:55,208 --> 00:18:00,127
    It's just, you've grown     
      so much as a person,      

357
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:02,546
I mean, putting your friends    
before yourself.                

358
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:05,967
I-I, it... I'm so proud of you. 

359
00:18:06,052 --> 00:18:07,435
              Oh.               

360
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,553
                  Thanks, honey.
                      (chuckles)

361
00:18:09,639 --> 00:18:12,223
            Aww. Mm.            

362
00:18:12,308 --> 00:18:14,892
      For tonight's match,      
 I created a signature cocktail 

363
00:18:14,944 --> 00:18:16,310
   to enjoy during warm-ups.    

364
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:17,561
                             Oh.

365
00:18:17,614 --> 00:18:19,897
  We are getting real classy.   

366
00:18:19,949 --> 00:18:22,283
       Hey, you know, this could
            be a rich guy sport,

367
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:25,736
           like polo            
   or non-miniature golfing.    

368
00:18:25,788 --> 00:18:27,738
        Yeah, this could        
        really catch on.        

369
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,407
 Uh, but we need a name first.  

370
00:18:29,492 --> 00:18:33,277
     You don't get on ESPN      
        without a name.         

371
00:18:33,329 --> 00:18:34,745
      I like "Wall Ball."       

372
00:18:34,831 --> 00:18:37,665
        Eh, too rhymey.         
   We don't want that crowd.    

373
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,667
Hmm.                            

374
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:43,587
How about "Wall Hole"?          

375
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,840
  I like it. It tells a story.  

376
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:48,342
      Oh, then we can call      
       my signature drink       

377
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:50,011
       an Andy Wall-Hole.       

378
00:18:51,147 --> 00:18:52,263
         Uh, no, I don't get it.

379
00:18:52,315 --> 00:18:53,514
        Well, you know,         
       like Andy Warhol.        

380
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:54,765
Ah.                             

381
00:18:54,817 --> 00:18:56,150
          Who's that?           

382
00:18:56,235 --> 00:19:00,271
Don. Andy Warhol?               

383
00:19:00,356 --> 00:19:02,323
From New York?                  

384
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:03,941
Plays shortstop for the Mets?   

385
00:19:05,361 --> 00:19:07,028
    Oh, right, right. Okay.     

386
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:11,699
Ah. Hey, Lowell, see if anyone  
owns the name WallHoleUSA.com.  

387
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:14,285
    Yeah, we're definitely gonna
 want that for the online store.

388
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:15,953
The money is in the merchandise.

389
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:20,007
      Someone already has       
      the Wall Hole site,       

390
00:19:20,093 --> 00:19:23,294
    but the subject matter's    
       quite disturbing.        

391
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:28,632
Ooh, she was not expecting that.

392
00:19:28,685 --> 00:19:30,351
       Oh-- well, maybe she was.

393
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:31,552
       (knocking on door)       

394
00:19:32,689 --> 00:19:33,971
Hey, Dad.                       
                            Hey.

395
00:19:34,023 --> 00:19:35,973
Dad, what are you doing here?   

396
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:38,142
You're supposed to be home      
resting from your knee surgery. 

397
00:19:38,227 --> 00:19:39,977
  Well, we heard from Don that  
  you boys had something good   

398
00:19:40,029 --> 00:19:43,814
 going on over here, so I told  
your mother that my nurse, uh...

399
00:19:43,866 --> 00:19:46,200
          Oh, my name is Funchy.
      You<i> can</i> just call me that.

400
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,235
      Sure thing, Nursey.       

401
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:51,238
    Said I should get out of    
the house and take a rehab walk.

402
00:19:52,542 --> 00:19:54,742
    So, uh, what's going on?    

403
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:58,862
I hope you're throwing something
        into that hole.         

404
00:19:58,915 --> 00:20:01,665
We need to talk to you.         

405
00:20:01,751 --> 00:20:02,833
        What's going on?        

406
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:04,668
You tell us. Our husbands       

407
00:20:04,721 --> 00:20:07,254
have been over at Lowell's      
apartment every night this week.

408
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,506
What are they up to?            

409
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:10,224
  They're not up to anything.   

410
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,009
     They're helping Lowell     
    during a difficult time.    

411
00:20:12,061 --> 00:20:14,929
I'm actually very proud of them.

412
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:16,680
    Bless her little heart.     

413
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:20,518
        No, i-it's true.        

414
00:20:20,603 --> 00:20:23,237
    I-- you should be happy.    
 Our husbands are good people.  

415
00:20:24,907 --> 00:20:27,491
I highly doubt that.            

416
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:29,360
Something's in it for them,     

417
00:20:29,412 --> 00:20:31,195
or else they wouldn't           
be over there.                  

418
00:20:31,247 --> 00:20:33,197
              No.               

419
00:20:33,249 --> 00:20:35,533
            Well...             

420
00:20:37,003 --> 00:20:40,037
That does sound more like Adam. 

421
00:20:40,123 --> 00:20:41,872
        Shoot. You know,        
        I really thought        

422
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,874
  he was growing as a person.   

423
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,876
   Honey, they don't do that.   

424
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,480
            LOWELL:             
          <i> All right.</i>           

425
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:51,265
           We're at match point.

426
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,884
       For the first time       
  in the history of Wall Hole,  

427
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:56,053
           a father and son meet
                in the playoffs.

428
00:20:56,139 --> 00:20:59,440
                    Can a family
                     survive it?

429
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:03,277
            (groans)            
All right.                      

430
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:04,478
Yeah!                           

431
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:06,480
  Dad makes it to the finals.   

432
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:08,732
        Even on one leg,        
    the old man smoked you.     

433
00:21:08,785 --> 00:21:10,451
      He gets in my head.       

434
00:21:10,536 --> 00:21:13,237
I built that head.              
I know my way around in there.  

435
00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:15,239
          Well, I've got winner.

436
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,074
         You know, I was getting
          burned out on nursing,

437
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,742
but now that I'm a pro athlete, 

438
00:21:18,795 --> 00:21:20,961
I've got my passion back.       

439
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:22,413
        (phone ringing)         

440
00:21:22,465 --> 00:21:25,633
        Ooh, it's Andi.         
      Uh, everybody shush.      

441
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:27,084
      Well, we're starting      
          a game here.          

442
00:21:27,136 --> 00:21:28,752
      Look, if I go down,       
        we all go down.         

443
00:21:28,805 --> 00:21:31,422
Uh, how exactly will<i> I</i> go down? 

444
00:21:31,507 --> 00:21:34,758
           Well, I--            
    Just, everybody, shush.     

445
00:21:34,811 --> 00:21:37,761
          Hey, honey.           

446
00:21:37,814 --> 00:21:40,764
No, Lowell's not doing so good. 

447
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:43,267
Friday was his and Jen's        
movie night,                    

448
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:45,653
so it's bringing up             
a lot of feelings.              

449
00:21:45,738 --> 00:21:48,939
   I think we're gonna watch    
     all the<i> Harry Potters.</i>     

450
00:21:48,991 --> 00:21:50,608
       Okay, bye, honey.        

451
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,777
           (chuckles)           
       Andi has no idea.        

452
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,162
      It's game on, boys.       

453
00:21:55,248 --> 00:21:57,331
           (laughter)           

454
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,533
  Well, he's terrible at this.  

455
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:03,504
 He didn't even hang up before  
  he said "Andi has no idea."   

456
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:05,339
So what's our move?             

457
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:08,125
   All I can say is, I've had   
    pepper spray in my purse    

458
00:22:08,177 --> 00:22:11,462
   for four years, and I want   
  to use it before it expires.  

459
00:22:15,017 --> 00:22:16,050
           That'll be the pizza.

460
00:22:16,135 --> 00:22:17,384
              Ooh.              
All right.                      

461
00:22:18,855 --> 00:22:20,521
                      Uh, oh.   

462
00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:22,556
  I can't believe that Lowell   
     started feeling better     

463
00:22:22,642 --> 00:22:23,858
       this very minute.        

464
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:26,694
      I say we all go home      

465
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:29,146
  to our beautiful wives. Huh?  

466
00:22:29,198 --> 00:22:31,232
                Oh, hey, ladies.

467
00:22:31,317 --> 00:22:34,318
(chuckles)                      
Didn't see you there.           

468
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:38,322
           Yes, I lied about why
              I was at Lowell's.

469
00:22:38,374 --> 00:22:41,075
      But you ambushed me before
            I could cover it up.

470
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,993
       So who's really at fault?

471
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:46,080
     You used your friend's     
          unhappiness           

472
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:49,250
     to go out and have fun     
  and avoid stuff around here.  

473
00:22:49,335 --> 00:22:52,253
            What? No. I love the
              stuff around here.

474
00:22:52,338 --> 00:22:55,723
Or were you trying to avoid me? 

475
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:58,592
                         No. No.

476
00:22:58,678 --> 00:23:01,512
   It was the stuff around here.
Mm-hmm.                         

477
00:23:01,564 --> 00:23:04,515
I mean, you're making up reasons
      to go out at night,       

478
00:23:04,567 --> 00:23:09,019
and... and... you don't want me 
    to have a desk at work.     

479
00:23:09,105 --> 00:23:10,938
Yeah. It's starting             
to come together now,           

480
00:23:11,023 --> 00:23:12,773
it's all connected.             

481
00:23:14,243 --> 00:23:16,777
 No, no, stop connecting things.

482
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:18,696
         Okay? H-Honey, I swear,

483
00:23:18,781 --> 00:23:22,116
this is just about me trying to 
 get away with something silly. 

484
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:24,785
          Well, then,           
    what's really going on?     

485
00:23:26,622 --> 00:23:29,373
        Okay, fine. Look-- uh...

486
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:30,591
               I was just trying

487
00:23:30,676 --> 00:23:32,543
    to enjoy a little break.    

488
00:23:32,595 --> 00:23:35,429
               But not from you.

489
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:38,132
         There's school projects

490
00:23:38,217 --> 00:23:43,053
             and shoes that need
           de-poopifying, and...

491
00:23:43,105 --> 00:23:46,440
              and the kids never
               turn off a light.

492
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:48,976
           I have probably spent
          three years of my life

493
00:23:49,061 --> 00:23:51,895
             turning off lights.

494
00:23:51,948 --> 00:23:54,565
        I mean, you have to know
         what I'm talking about.

495
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,483
No, I don't.                    

496
00:23:56,569 --> 00:23:58,736
I find every minute             
with my children                

497
00:23:58,788 --> 00:24:01,905
to be a joy to treasure.        

498
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:03,824
                         Do you?

499
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:05,576
(mouths)                        

500
00:24:05,628 --> 00:24:09,830
 Two weeks ago, when you went to
 Target to buy Teddy new shorts?

501
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:12,750
Mm-hmm.                         
                You were gone so
            long, I got worried.

502
00:24:12,802 --> 00:24:15,970
     Yeah. So I went down there.

503
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:18,288
         And you know who I saw,
               drinking an Icee,

504
00:24:18,341 --> 00:24:20,641
               watching<i> Dr. Phil</i>
              in the TV section?

505
00:24:20,726 --> 00:24:23,510
My long-lost twin sister?       

506
00:24:23,596 --> 00:24:26,814
           No, it was you, baby.

507
00:24:28,484 --> 00:24:30,100
      But I didn't say anything.

508
00:24:30,152 --> 00:24:33,937
         I left and let you have
     your time because I get it.

509
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,272
  And also, to keep in my pocket

510
00:24:35,324 --> 00:24:37,324
               in case something
              like this came up.

511
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:41,028
Well, I'm very sorry...         
that you found out about that.  

512
00:24:42,665 --> 00:24:44,531
You know, we do spend           
a lot of time                   

513
00:24:44,617 --> 00:24:45,866
taking care of other people.    

514
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:47,534
          That's all I'm saying.

515
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,536
And since we're coming clean,   

516
00:24:49,622 --> 00:24:52,122
I should tell you that time     
at Target, it wasn't my first.  

517
00:24:52,174 --> 00:24:54,541
They know me there.             

518
00:24:54,627 --> 00:25:00,714
They let me use the remote      
that controls all 65 TVs.       

519
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,634
        There's a master remote?
Uh-huh.                         

520
00:25:03,686 --> 00:25:05,636
           How big is it? I need
          to know how big it is.

521
00:25:05,688 --> 00:25:08,138
Eh, it's not big,               
but it's heavy.                 

522
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:10,057
                   (laughs):    
                     Nice.      
        Yeah.                   

523
00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:12,643
                        You see?

524
00:25:12,695 --> 00:25:16,196
          Everyone needs to bust
            out once in a while.

525
00:25:16,282 --> 00:25:19,983
              My mistake was not
        busting you out with me.

526
00:25:20,035 --> 00:25:22,736
Aw, that's sweet.               

527
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:24,822
And, you know, maybe I should've

528
00:25:24,907 --> 00:25:28,242
taken you with me               
to watch the 65 TVs.            

529
00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:32,162
           I would like to check
                out that remote.

530
00:25:32,214 --> 00:25:36,383
You know, Target's open         
for another hour.               

531
00:25:36,469 --> 00:25:38,836
                    Let's do it.
Yeah.                           

532
00:25:38,888 --> 00:25:42,005
      Oh, h-hey, kids, uh,      
  we're going out to run some   

533
00:25:42,057 --> 00:25:44,091
 very important adult errands.  

534
00:25:46,061 --> 00:25:48,262
 Pro tip, if you angle the TVs  
          just right,           

535
00:25:48,314 --> 00:25:51,765
        you can watch it        
    from the bed department.    

536
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:54,067
     I am so glad I married you.

537
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:55,269
Hmm.                            

538
00:26:01,025 --> 00:26:02,109
            I landed.           

539
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:04,311
I saw my leg did not look right.

540
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,997
  I was just finishing a ride.  

541
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:08,949
  I felt this awful pain in my  
             chest.             

542
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:11,368
   I had a PE blood clot in my  
              lung.             

543
00:26:11,454 --> 00:26:12,536
          I was scared.         

544
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:13,821
     I had a DVT blood clot.    

545
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:17,174
  Having one really puts you in 
    danger of having another.   

546
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,159
 My doctor and I chose XARELTO®.

547
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:21,128
    XARELTO®. To help keep me   
           protected.

575
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,636

    No, I can't believe how

579
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,530
 to save hundreds of dollars on 
 our car insurance with GEICO.

     Andi, I know you were upset
       with Adam, but this week,

607
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:05,692
 I started to enjoy my new life.

608
00:29:05,778 --> 00:29:07,861
           Having the guys there

     Go tell that to Marcy.     

610
00:29:09,531 --> 00:29:11,315
         I had to sleep         
 on the porch swing last night.

Don't worry, Lowell.

Adam and I are good.            

613
00:29:15,537 --> 00:29:16,987
All right, well,                
I have some paperwork to do,    

614
00:29:17,072 --> 00:29:19,656
so if you need me,              
I'll be in my bulldozer.        

615
00:29:19,708 --> 00:29:22,492
             Oh, whoa, whoa, why
         would you go out there,

616
00:29:22,544 --> 00:29:24,745
          when you can          
     just do your work here

00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:27,247
               on your new desk?

             Whoa.              
                           Yeah.

619
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:30,751
  I invented the Murphy desk.   

620
00:29:30,836 --> 00:29:33,503
        The Murphy bed's

    Now I'm officially part

623
00:29:37,676 --> 00:29:39,509
         Thanks, honey.         

624
00:29:39,561 --> 00:29:41,895
Hmm, yeah. Wall hole, wall desk.

625
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:46,183
Man, the "wall" part of my brain
  is really firing right now.
