star.                           
You guys wouldn't have signed   

754
00:25:58,808 --> 00:25:59,974
star.                           
You guys wouldn't have signed   
him if you didn't think so.     

755
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:01,809
You guys wouldn't have signed   
him if you didn't think so.     
And he was willing to risk all  

756
00:26:01,811 --> 00:26:02,876
him if you didn't think so.     
And he was willing to risk all  
of that for me.                 

757
00:26:02,878 --> 00:26:04,378
And he was willing to risk all  
of that for me.                 
He put a friend ahead of        

758
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,079
of that for me.                 
He put a friend ahead of        
himself.                        

759
00:26:05,081 --> 00:26:06,947
He put a friend ahead of        
himself.                        
I mean, come on, haven't either 

760
00:26:06,949 --> 00:26:08,582

I mean, come on, haven't either 
of you guys ever done that      

761
00:26:08,584 --> 00:26:12,853
I mean, come on, haven't either 
of you guys ever done that      
before?

I'm capable of doing something  

770
00:26:26,302 --> 00:26:27,201
>> Summer: What, you don't think
I'm capable of doing something  
nice occasionally?              

771
00:26:27,203 --> 00:26:30,037
I'm capable of doing something

You claim...

You claim...

what I had done to J.T., but... 
I did what I had to do,         
what I was forced to do.        

784
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:12,946
I did what I had to do,

night of J.T.'s death?

So, tell me, what happened the

hide, not anymore.              
It was the Girls' Night at      
Victoria's house.               

793
00:27:27,463 --> 00:27:28,929

Phyllis, Mariah, and me.        
We were comforting Victoria over

797
00:27:37,173 --> 00:27:39,073
Phyllis, Mariah, and me.        
We were comforting Victoria over
her break-up with J.T.          

798
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:41,708
We were comforting Victoria over
her break-up with J.T.          
She got emotional and went      

799
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:44,678
her break-up with J.T.          
She got emotional and went      
upstairs to try to calm down a  

800
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,648
She got emotional and went      
upstairs to try to calm down a  
little bit, and she -- she was  

801
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:50,384
upstairs to try to calm down a  
little bit, and she -- she was  
gone for a long time, so...     

802
00:27:50,386 --> 00:27:53,120
little bit, and she -- she was  
gone for a long time, so...     
I got worried and, by then,     

803
00:27:53,122 --> 00:27:56,123
gone for a long time, so...     
I got worried and, by then,     
Mariah had passed out, so I --  

804
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:57,758
I got worried and, by then,     
Mariah had passed out, so I --  
I told Sharon and Phyllis that I

805
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,226
Mariah had passed out, so I --  
I told Sharon and Phyllis that I
wanted to go up and check on    

806
00:27:59,228 --> 00:27:59,860
I told Sharon and Phyllis that I
wanted to go up and check on    
Victoria.                       

807
00:27:59,862 --> 00:28:01,495
wanted to go up and check on    
Victoria.                       
>> Rey: Mm, so you went upstairs

808
00:28:01,497 --> 00:28:01,995
Victoria.                       
>> Rey: Mm, so you went upstairs
alone?                          

809
00:28:01,997 --> 00:28:03,297
>> Rey: Mm, so you went upstairs
alone?                          
>> Nikki: Yes.                  

810
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:07,000
alone?                          
>> Nikki: Yes.                  
And as I approached the bedroom,

811
00:28:07,002 --> 00:28:10,404
>> Nikki: Yes.                  
And as I approached the bedroom,
I could hear a lot of yelling   

812
00:28:10,406 --> 00:28:13,674
And as I approached the bedroom,
I could hear a lot of yelling   
and -- and crashing going on    

813
00:28:13,676 --> 00:28:14,875
I could hear a lot of yelling   
and -- and crashing going on    
inside.                         

814
00:28:14,877 --> 00:28:17,978
and -- and crashing going on    
inside.                         
So I went in, and J.T. was      

815
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:21,281
inside.                         
So I went in, and J.T. was      
screaming at her, and he was    

816
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:22,983
So I went in, and J.T. was      
screaming at her, and he was    
choking her.                    

817
00:28:22,985 --> 00:28:25,786
screaming at her, and he was    
choking her.                    
And I had tried to get him to   

818
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:27,421
choking her.                    
And I had tried to get him to   
stop, and he --                 

819
00:28:27,423 --> 00:28:29,456
And I had tried to get him to   
stop, and he --                 
He just threw me off of him, and

820
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:31,258
stop, and he --                 
He just threw me off of him, and
I landed on the floor by the    

821
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,092
He just threw me off of him, and
I landed on the floor by the    
fireplace.                      

822
00:28:32,094 --> 00:28:34,661
I landed on the floor by the    
fireplace.                      
And then I saw the fireplace    

823
00:28:34,663 --> 00:28:36,196
fireplace.                      
And then I saw the fireplace    
poker, and I...                 

824
00:28:36,198 --> 00:28:37,965
And then I saw the fireplace    
poker, and I...                 
I grabbed it,                   

825
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:39,633
poker, and I...                 
I grabbed it,                   
and then I yelled at him        

826
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:42,569
I grabbed it,                   
and then I yelled at him        
to stop it.                     

827
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:44,671
and then I yelled at him        
to stop it.                     
>> Rey: And?                    

828
00:28:44,673 --> 00:28:47,741

But the look in his eyes...

>> Nikki: And he did.           
But the look in his eyes...     
it was pure hate.               

831
00:28:54,216 --> 00:28:55,983
But the look in his eyes...     
it was pure hate.               
>> Rey: Then what happened?     

832
00:28:55,985 --> 00:28:59,186
it was pure hate.               
>> Rey: Then what happened?

>> Nikki: Then he left through  
the window.                     
>> Rey: So you -- you followed  

835
00:29:03,425 --> 00:29:04,124
the window.                     
>> Rey: So you -- you followed  
him?

00:29:04,126 --> 00:29:05,893
>> Rey: So you -- you followed  
him?                            
>> Nikki: I was most concerned  

837
00:29:05,895 --> 00:29:07,628

>> Nikki: I was most concerned  
with making sure Victoria was   

838
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:09,363
>> Nikki: I was most concerned  
with making sure Victoria was   
okay, that she was all right.   

839
00:29:09,365 --> 00:29:12,499
with making sure Victoria was   
okay, that she was all right.   
And then I promised her that I  

840
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:15,369
okay, that she was all right.   
And then I promised her that I  
would protect her, keep her     

841
00:29:15,371 --> 00:29:16,270
And then I promised her that I  
would protect her, keep her     
safe.                           

842
00:29:16,272 --> 00:29:18,839
would protect her, keep her     
safe.                           
And then she and I went back    

843
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:21,441
safe.                           
And then she and I went back    
downstairs to the party, and    

844
00:29:21,443 --> 00:29:24,011
And then she and I went back    
downstairs to the party, and    
then, when I felt nobody was    

845
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:26,813
downstairs to the party, and    
then, when I felt nobody was    
really noticing, I slipped out, 

846
00:29:26,815 --> 00:29:29,550
then, when I felt nobody was    
really noticing, I slipped out, 
determined to keep my promise.  

847
00:29:29,552 --> 00:29:31,485
really noticing, I slipped out, 
determined to keep my promise.

planning on confessing.

00:29:47,336 --> 00:29:49,069
>> Nick: I don't think she was  
planning on confessing.         
So whatever she's saying, she's 

857
00:29:49,071 --> 00:29:49,836
planning on confessing.         
So whatever she's saying, she's 
winging it.                     

858
00:29:49,838 --> 00:29:51,405
So whatever she's saying, she's

00:29:51,407 --> 00:29:53,140
winging it.

doesn't have any idea what she's

860
00:29:53,142 --> 00:29:54,875
>> Victoria: Which means she    
doesn't have any idea what she's
going to say, and neither do we.

861
00:29:54,877 --> 00:29:57,444

>> Nikki: When I went outside,  
he was there.                   
He took off on foot, so I       

864
00:30:01,217 --> 00:30:04,184
he was there.                   
He took off on foot, so I       
followed him to Chancellor Park.

865
00:30:04,186 --> 00:30:06,053
He took off on foot, so I       
followed him to Chancellor Park.
That's -- That's where I        

866
00:30:06,055 --> 00:30:07,354
followed him to Chancellor Park.
That's -- That's where I        
confronted him.                 

867
00:30:07,356 --> 00:30:08,155
That's -- That's where I

what he had done to Victor.     
And to Victoria.

what he had done to Victor.     
And to Victoria.                
And he laughed.                 

872
00:30:16,031 --> 00:30:18,165
And to Victoria.                
And he laughed.                 
He said that the police couldn't

873
00:30:18,167 --> 00:30:20,100
And he laughed.                 
He said that the police couldn't
stop him and neither could I,   

874
00:30:20,102 --> 00:30:22,135
He said that the police couldn't
stop him and neither could I,   
and he vowed to finish what he  

875
00:30:22,137 --> 00:30:23,103
stop him and neither could I,   
and he vowed to finish what he  
had started.                    

876
00:30:23,105 --> 00:30:25,239
and he vowed to finish what he  
had started.                    
He said it would be easy because

877
00:30:25,241 --> 00:30:26,840
had started.                    
He said it would be easy because
Victor was still in the         

878
00:30:26,842 --> 00:30:28,809
He said it would be easy because
Victor was still in the         
hospital and because Victoria   

879
00:30:28,811 --> 00:30:29,610
Victor was still in the         
hospital and because Victoria   
was weak.                       

880
00:30:29,612 --> 00:30:33,714
hospital and because Victoria   
was weak.                       
I raise the poker and I told him

881
00:30:33,716 --> 00:30:35,983
was weak.                       
I raise the poker and I told him
I wasn't.                       

882
00:30:35,985 --> 00:30:38,852
I raise the poker and I told him
I wasn't.                       
And he mocked me.               

883
00:30:38,854 --> 00:30:40,621
I wasn't.                       
And he mocked me.               
He taunted me.                  

884
00:30:40,623 --> 00:30:43,090
And he mocked me.               
He taunted me.                  
He said that I was a coward,    

885
00:30:43,092 --> 00:30:45,826
He taunted me.                  
He said that I was a coward,    
just like the rest of my family.

886
00:30:45,828 --> 00:30:47,894
He said that I was a coward,    
just like the rest of my family.
And he threatened to just take  

887
00:30:47,896 --> 00:30:50,063
just like the rest of my family.
And he threatened to just take  
us all out, one by one, starting

888
00:30:50,065 --> 00:30:50,831
And he threatened to just take  
us all out, one by one, starting
with me.                        

889
00:30:50,833 --> 00:30:53,066
us all out, one by one, starting
with me.                        
Well, I -- I knew what he was   

890
00:30:53,068 --> 00:30:55,402
with me.                        
Well, I -- I knew what he was   
capable of, and so I raised my  

891
00:30:55,404 --> 00:30:57,704
Well, I -- I knew what he was   
capable of, and so I raised my  
poker again, and I told him to  

892
00:30:57,706 --> 00:30:58,705
capable of, and so I raised my  
poker again, and I told him to  
back away.                      

893
00:30:58,707 --> 00:31:01,575
poker again, and I told him to  
back away.                      
But then he lunged at me.       

894
00:31:01,577 --> 00:31:04,211
back away.                      
But then he lunged at me.       
And I just swung that poker as  

895
00:31:04,213 --> 00:31:05,779
But then he lunged at me.       
And I just swung that poker as  
hard as I could.                

896
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:08,682
And I just swung that poker as  
hard as I could.                
And it hit him in the head.     

897
00:31:08,684 --> 00:31:12,152
hard as I could.                
And it hit him in the head.     
I was so stunned when he went   

898
00:31:12,154 --> 00:31:14,421
And it hit him in the head.     
I was so stunned when he went   
down because I --               

899
00:31:14,423 --> 00:31:19,726
I was so stunned when he went   
down because I --               
I didn't mean to hurt him.      

900
00:31:19,728 --> 00:31:21,762
down because I --               
I didn't mean to hurt him.      
>> Rey: Why didn't you call the 

901
00:31:21,764 --> 00:31:22,429

police?                         

902

00:31:26,502 --> 00:31:28,635
>> Nikki: Once I realized he was
dead, I panicked and...         
I didn't think that you would

I didn't think that you would   
believe that it was in          

906
00:31:30,339 --> 00:31:31,471
I didn't think that you would   
believe that it was in          
self-defense.                   

907
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:33,907
believe that it was in          
self-defense.                   
>> Rey: So you decided to dig a 

908
00:31:33,909 --> 00:31:35,976
self-defense.

hole and bury him instead?

>> Rey: So you decided to dig a 
hole and bury him instead?

The garden we were planting...  

911
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:45,018

The garden we were planting...  
I just rolled his body into the

The garden we were planting...  
I just rolled his body into the 
dirt, and put more on top of it,

913
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:50,023
I just rolled his body into the 
dirt, and put more on top of it,
and that was it, I left.        

914
00:31:50,025 --> 00:31:52,426
dirt, and put more on top of it,
and that was it, I left.

If somebody hurt your wife or

00:32:42,244 --> 00:32:47,280
If your adventure keeps turning 
into unexpected bathroom trips  

935
00:32:47,315 --> 00:32:51,334
you may have overactive bladder,
or OAB.                         

936
00:32:54,173 --> 00:32:58,759
Ohhhh... enough already! We need
to see a doctor.                

937
00:32:58,794 --> 00:33:01,294
Ask your doctor about Myrbetriq®
(mirabegron).                   

938
00:33:01,329 --> 00:33:04,097
It treats OAB symptoms of       
urgency, frequency, and leakage.

939
00:33:04,133 --> 00:33:07,467
  It's the first and only OAB   
  treatment in its class.       

940
00:33:07,502 --> 00:33:08,501
  Myrbetriq may increase blood  
  pressure.                     

941
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,670
 Tell your doctor right away if 
 you have trouble               

942
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:12,889
emptying your bladder or have a 
weak urine stream.              

943
00:33:12,941 --> 00:33:14,441
  Myrbetriq may cause serious   
  allergic reactions            

944
00:33:14,476 --> 00:33:16,443
like swelling of the face, lips,
throat or tongue,               

945
00:33:16,478 --> 00:33:17,644
     or trouble breathing.      

946
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,397
If experienced, stop taking and 
tell your doctor right away.    

947
00:33:20,449 --> 00:33:22,282
  Myrbetriq may interact with   
  other medicines.              

948
00:33:22,317 --> 00:33:24,350
  Tell your doctor if you have  
  liver or kidney problems.     

949
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:26,286
  Common side effects include   
  increased blood pressure,     

950
00:33:26,321 --> 00:33:28,955
  common cold or flu symptoms,  
  sinus irritation, dry mouth,  

951
00:33:28,991 --> 00:33:30,741
urinary tract infection, bladder
inflammation,                   

952
00:33:30,793 --> 00:33:32,292
      back or joint pain,       

953
00:33:32,327 --> 00:33:33,910
  constipation, dizziness, and  
  headache.                     

954
00:33:33,962 --> 00:33:36,496
Need some help managing your OAB
symptoms along the way?         

955
00:33:36,531 --> 00:33:38,698
Ask your doctor if Myrbetriq is 
right for you,

Ok I'll admit. I didn't keep my 
place as clean as I would like  

967
00:33:59,188 --> 00:34:00,821
     'cuz I'm way too busy.     

968
00:34:00,856 --> 00:34:03,607
Who's got the time to chase     
around down dirt, dust and hair?

969

Sweeper and Dusters.

makes it easy to clean.

 It captures dust in one swipe.

          Ha! Gotcha!

  twice as much dirt and dust.  

975
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:21,458
 It gets stuff deep in the      
 grooves other tools can miss.  

976
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:24,344
 Y'know what? My place... is a  
 lot cleaner now.               

977
00:34:24,379 --> 00:34:25,796
Stop cleaning. Start Swiffering.
