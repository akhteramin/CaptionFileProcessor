>> You know, the SR-71.         

144
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:17,456
>> This plane is actually quite 

145
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:18,156
old, isn't it?                  

146
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,424
>> Yeah, well, I think it dates 

147
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:21,159
back from the '50s, early '60s. 

148
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,928
>> The SR-71 was essentially    

149
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:24,029
a spy plane                     

150
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,163
that was designed to operate    

151
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,665
at high speeds and altitudes,   

152
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,567
making it almost invisible.     

153
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:30,469
And in its 25 years of service, 

154
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,237
an estimated 4,000 missiles     

155
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:33,205
were fired at it,               

156
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:34,273
and not a single one            

157
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:35,641
hit its target.                 

158
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:37,009
>> What intrigues me about      

159
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,044
the SR-71 is they had to        

160
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:41,680
design it to be most efficient  

161
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,248
at the Mach 3 speeds            

162
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:43,915
it was hitting.                 

163
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:44,583
>> Right.                       

164
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:45,250
>> And at Mach 3,               

165
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:46,685
air is going rapidly            

166
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,086
over the skin of the plane.     

167
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:48,920
>> Right.                       

168
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,122
>> And there's friction,        

169
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:51,223
there are shock waves           

170
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:52,858
transmitting energy             

171
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:53,692
in the form of heat,            

172
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:54,660
blowing air on top of it.       

173
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:55,994
>> So is the plane hotter       

174
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:56,762
than the air?                   

175
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:57,462
>> So here's what happens.      

176
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:58,163
Here's air.                     

177
00:04:58,264 --> 00:04:58,830
>> Yeah.                        

178
00:04:58,931 --> 00:04:59,631
>> And you're moving rapidly    

179
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:00,666
through it, you rapidly compress

180
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:01,333
the air.                        

181
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:02,000
>> Right.                       

182
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:02,668
>> That will raise              

183
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:03,435
the temperature of the air.     

184
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:04,202
>> I see, I got you, I got you. 

185
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:04,970
>> That's what's happening.     

186
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:05,671
If the air just slowly          

187
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:06,672
goes out of your way            

188
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:07,339
as you go through it--          

189
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,006
>> Okay.                        

190
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:08,674
>> When you walk through        

191
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:09,341
the air--                       

192
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:10,008
>> Right.                       

193
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:10,676
>> You're not--                 

194
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:11,343
>> And is that how you          

195
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:12,210
walk through the air like that? 

196
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:12,878
Is that how you--               

197
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:13,712
When you're alone and there's   

198
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:14,479
nobody around, is that how      

199
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,414
you walk through the air?       

200
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:16,148
>> When I'm not going fast      

201
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:16,815
through the air--               

202
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:17,482
>> Right, right, okay.          

203
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:18,317
And I'm not passing judgment.   

204
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:18,984
That's fine with me.            

205
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:20,352
>> Well, the air parts for me.  

206
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:21,353
>> The air parts for you.       

207
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:22,087
>> Yes, yes, okay.              

208
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:23,322
So the cool thing about this is 

209
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:24,756
you fill it with fuel...        

210
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:25,424
>> Right.                       

211
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,359
>> But on the ground,           

212
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,894
the fuel would just drip.       

213
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,829
Why? Because the seals          

214
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,631
of the plane are not yet closed.

215
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:33,665
>> Well they need heat to close.

216
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:35,000
>> Yes! Yes.                    

217
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:36,702
So the plane is designed        

218
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,303
to exist at a much higher       

219
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:39,738
temperature when it's going     

220
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,106
Mach 2, Mach 3.                 

221
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:42,708
Then the heat gets transmitted  

222
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:43,709
to the fuselage,                

223
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,210
the fuselage expands,           

224
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:46,545
all the seals close--           

225
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:47,212
>> Right.                       

226
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:48,747
>> And now you've got a mean    

227
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,915
fighting machine.               

228
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:50,716
>> Let's go inside.             

229
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:51,383
>> Yeah.                        

230
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:54,486
Love me some airplane museums.  

231
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:56,254
>> Wow, a lot of history here.  

232
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,255
Now the cool part is,           

233
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,423
this is stuff most folks        

234
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,825
don't usually get to see.       

235
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:00,826
But the people at Edwards       

236
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:01,893
have opened up a few doors      

237
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:02,994
for us, and we're gonna         

238
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:04,529
take a look at the history      

239
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,099
of speed.                       

240
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:07,833
That's the one that broke       

241
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:08,567
the sound barrier.              

242
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:09,735
>> Right. You can see the design

243
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,269
is very different from          

244
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,270
all of those, sort of,          

245
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,721
World War II airplanes          

246
00:06:13,823 --> 00:06:15,607
that have rounded noses.        

247
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:16,675
>> The aerodynamic design       

248
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:17,876
of this plane not only helped   

249
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:18,777
Chuck Yeager break              

250
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:19,811
the sound barrier,              

251
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:21,313
it also influenced car design   

252
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:24,983
and technology forever.         

253
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:27,185
>> Here we got the engine       

254
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:29,855
that was actually in the X-15.  

255
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:30,589
>> So it went at                

256
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,157
249,000 feet.                   

257
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:33,058
So they were essentially        

258
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:33,825
astronauts, weren't they?       

259
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:34,493
>> Yeah, essentially,           

260
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:35,961
and all the early generations   

261
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:36,962
of astronauts you had,          

262
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,463
you know, flight time in this.  

263
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:39,131
>> Right.                       

264
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:39,831
So did you ever want to be      

265
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:40,665
an astronaut?                   

266
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:41,500
>> No, I never did.             

267
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:42,667
I knew early on that            

268
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,136
I loved astrophysics.           

269
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,804
So, the large-scale universe.   

270
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,906
And there was NASA going into,  

271
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:49,374
like, low Earth orbit.          

272
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:50,041
>> Right.                       

273
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:50,709
>> And maybe to the Moon        

274
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,376
and back, but to me,            

275
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:52,644
that was such a small part      

276
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,980
of the universe at large,       

277
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,214
that, to me, that wasn't really 

278
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:57,082
going into space.               

279
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:58,083
>> Yeah. See, I knew            

280
00:06:58,184 --> 00:06:58,850
I wanted to be an astronaut.    

281
00:06:58,951 --> 00:06:59,518
I flew with                     

282
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:00,519
the Blue Angels once.           

283
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,153
>> Oh, okay.                    

284
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:01,987
>> And you realize these guys   

285
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,422
are smarter than you,           

286
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:05,424
can do math better than you,    

287
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:06,491
can do more push-ups than you-- 

288
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,359
>> [laughs] Push-ups.           

289
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,026
>> Uh--                         

290
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:08,727
>> Okay, but that's not why     

291
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:09,761
I didn't--I wasn't--            

292
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:10,996
>> I'm sure that's why--        

293
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:11,897
I'm sure could have passed      

294
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,265
the physical when you walked in 

295
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:14,099
like this.                      

296
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,434
I'm sure that would have--      

297
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:16,234
When you split the air          

298
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:17,602
like this...                    

299
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:21,640
Okay, I like museums            

300
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:22,808
as much as the next guy,        

301
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:24,176
but you know, I think it's time 

302
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,977
to meet the real deal.          

303
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:26,845
>> Hello.                       

304
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:27,512
>> Hi.                          

305
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,380
>> Hello, hello.                

306
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:29,381
>> Madam Secretary.             

307
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:30,382
>> Hello there.                 

308
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:31,249
>> It's a pleasure. Neil Tyson. 

309
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:31,983
>> Debbie James, so nice        

310
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:32,751
to meet you, Neil.              

311
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:34,519
>> Deborah Lee James is the 23rd

312
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,954
Secretary of the Air Force,     

313
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:37,255
and only the second woman       

314
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:39,124
to hold this position.          

315
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:41,326
She oversees over 600,000       

316
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:42,527
airmen and women,               

317
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:43,762
as well as the Air Force's      

318
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:49,000
annual budget of $139 billion.  

319
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:50,001
>> Welcome to Edwards           

320
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:51,703
and welcome to the most advanced

321
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,104
aircraft in our inventory,      

322
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:53,772
the F-22.                       

323
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:54,873
>> We'll be the judge of that.  

324
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,107
[laughter]                      

325
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,509
>> The F-22 Raptor is the most  

326
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:58,777
intelligent jet fighter         

327
00:07:58,878 --> 00:07:59,511
in the world.                   

328
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:00,178
It's loud,                      

329
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,546
incredibly intimidating,        

330
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:02,614
and has a cruising speed of     

331
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:05,484
just over 1,200 miles an hour.  

332
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:06,218
And if its design               

333
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,319
looks familiar,                 

334
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,955
that's because most super cars, 

335
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:11,122
hyper cars, whatever you want   

336
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:11,857
to call them,                   

337
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,058
all take influence              

338
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,993
from this aircraft.             

339
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:16,127
And what is the flying speed?   

340
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:17,229
>> So it's a Mach 2             

341
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,163
class airplane, which means     

342
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,064
it can go approximately         

343
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,365
twice the speed of sound.       

344
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:21,766
The airplane is capable of going

345
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:22,934
much faster than that,          

346
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:24,002
but there's limitations         

347
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:24,936
as far as actually              

348
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:26,037
skin temperature.               

349
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:26,805
Airplane gets too hot           

350
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:27,806
if it goes too fast.            

351
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:28,807
>> First rule of combat,        

352
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:29,808
don't vaporize your pilot.      

353
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:30,475
>> Exactly.                     

354
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:31,209
>> Right. They hate it when     

355
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:31,877
you do that.                    

356
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:32,544
>> They hate every time         

357
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:33,211
it happens.                     

358
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:33,879
>> The other cool thing         

359
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,546
about this aircraft is          

360
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:35,547
it's highly stealthy,           

361
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:36,915
which means it's nearly         

362
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,416
invisible to what could be      

363
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,551
enemy radar.                    

364
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:41,353
>> Now where does it fire from? 

365
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,121
Is this a bomber, primarily?    

366
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:44,122
>> This is primarily            

367
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:44,956
an air-to-air fighter           

368
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:46,091
with an air-to-ground role.     

369
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,226
You can see, this is the doors  

370
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:50,262
for one of the side weapon bays.

371
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:50,929
>> Okay.                        

372
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,596
>> There's a total of two       

373
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:52,297
side weapon bays,               

374
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:53,565
which can fit one missile each. 

375
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:54,566
Two underwing bays, which can   

376
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,401
fit three missiles each.        

377
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:57,168
>> The engines are way          

378
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:57,969
back here.                      

379
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,170
How many cubic feet of air      

380
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:00,639
goes through there every minute?

381
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,840
Do you know?                    

382
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,208
>> Just say a bajillion.        

383
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:03,875
>> A bajillion?                 

384
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:04,543
>> Yeah, yeah.                  

385
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:05,210
>> A lot.                       

386
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,044
>> Are there manual controls    

387
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:06,745
to any of this, or is it        

388
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:07,445
all electronic?                 

389
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,313
>> It's all electronic.         

390
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:09,047
>> Okay.                        

391
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:10,549
>> Will the computer ever judge 

392
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,217
that the pilot's crazy?         

393
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:13,818
We're not doing that--[laughs]  

394
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,519
We're not following             

395
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,320
that instruction.               

396
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:16,922
>> Yes, it's self--             

397
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:17,589
[booming]                       

398
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,657
>> [screams]                    

399
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:20,392
[laughter]                      

400
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,961
>> That's a sonic boom.         

401
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,729
>> That was a big sonic boom.   

402
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:25,397
Okay--                          

403
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:26,064
>> That was a standard          

404
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:26,765
sonic boom.                     

405
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,099
[laughter]                      

406
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,867
>> Okay, now you've seen        

407
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:30,535
just how brave I am.            

408
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:31,536
Let's head to the test stand,   

409
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:32,837
where we can see this engine    

410
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,140
in action.                      

411
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,841
Looks a lot bigger up close.    

412
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:37,676
>> And Jay and Neil, I want     

413
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:38,877
to introduce you to Triggs      

414
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:39,544
from Pratt & Whitney.           

415
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:40,445
>> Mike Triggs,                 

416
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:41,112
nice to meet you, Jay.          

417
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:42,247
>> Triggs, as in trigonometry?  

418
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:42,914
>> Oh, yes, sir.                

419
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:43,782
>> The plural of trigonometry.  

420
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:44,482
>> Yes sir, heard that          

421
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,483
many times.                     

422
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,217
Welcome, welcome, nice to       

423
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:46,885
meet you.                       

424
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:47,552
>> What would this be           

425
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:48,720
in automotive horsepower?       

426
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:50,488
I know you measure differently. 

427
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,122

 Jet and it's awesome.

It's an all-in-one that absorbs 
dirt and grime deep inside.     

999
00:25:30,479 --> 00:25:33,397
And it helps prevent streaks and
haze.

    Before starting EPCLUSA,    
        your doctor will        

1029
00:26:36,712 --> 00:26:39,396
      test if you have had      
hepatitis B, which may flare up 

1030
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:41,432
        and could cause

>> Why is this Scarecrow?       

1633
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:37,754
>> Because it doesn't           

1634
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:38,421
have a brain.                   

1635
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:39,088
>> That's why they call me      

1636
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:40,023
Scarecrow at the network.       

1637
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:41,324
I had no idea.                  

1638
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:42,025
>> Well I'm gonna leave you     

1639
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:42,992
in Gareth's capable hands.      

1640
00:42:43,093 --> 00:42:43,826
>> Okay, well thank you,        

1641
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:44,794
thank you very much.            

1642
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:45,495
Thank you.                      

1643
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:46,496
>> So let's start with          

1644
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:47,497
something simple.               

1645
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:48,264
The top button                  

1646
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:49,832
in the middle, there, says      

1647
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:51,234
"forward five meters."          

1648
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:53,903
♪ ♪                             

1649
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:55,438
This is really the workhorse    

1650
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:56,940
of our mobility testing         

1651
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:58,041
in the Mars Yard.               

1652
00:42:58,142 --> 00:42:59,142
We do the vast majority         

1653
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,076
of our testing with this        

1654
00:43:00,177 --> 00:43:01,110
especially before we do anything

1655
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:02,545
with VSTB.                      

1656
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:04,080
>> You know, for $2.5 billion,  

1657
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:05,048
I expect a little more          

1658
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:06,082
horsepower, maybe some          

1659
00:43:06,183 --> 00:43:07,016
leather interior.               

1660
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:08,117
But that's okay.                

1661
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:09,886
Let's pick up the pace here.    

1662
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:12,188
This is a show about going fast.

1663
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:14,157
Stop.                           

1664
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:14,857
Wow.                            

1665
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:15,625
>> So we're gonna aim to        

1666
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:18,861
put it over some rocks.         

1667
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:19,963
So here you're gonna see        

1668
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:20,997
the vehicle ascend              

1669
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:22,498
this rock that we've placed     

1670
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,566
in front of it.                 

1671
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:24,834
So you'll notice that one thing 

1672
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,502
we try to do is when            

1673
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:27,804
one side of the vehicle         

1674
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:28,805
is going over a rock...         

1675
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:29,472
>> Right.                       

1676
00:43:29,573 --> 00:43:30,139
>> We don't want the whole      

1677
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:30,873
vehicle to stop rolling.        

1678
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:31,541
>> Right.                       

1679
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:33,042
>> So we have a differential    

1680
00:43:33,143 --> 00:43:33,910
on top of the vehicle           

1681
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:35,078
and that makes sure that        

1682
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:36,346
when one wheel goes up on       

1683
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,481
one side, the other goes down.  

1684
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:39,215
>> Okay, sure,                  

1685
00:43:39,316 --> 00:43:39,849
it's a little bit slow,         

1686
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,451
but incredibly efficient.       

1687
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:43,119
And keep in mind, the real Rover

1688
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,654
is doing this right now,        

1689
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:47,457
more than 249,000,000 miles away

1690
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:49,158
on Mars and in, believe me,     

1691
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:51,494
far worse conditions.           

1692
00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:52,462
Well Gareth, thank you.         

1693
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:53,463
It's fascinating.               

1694
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:55,565
>> You're very welcome.         

1695
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:56,532
>> So what if NASA made         

1696
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:57,333
a production car?               

1697
00:43:57,434 --> 00:43:58,935
Would you buy it?               

1698
00:43:59,036 --> 00:43:59,569
Well, they're not quite         

1699
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:00,737
there yet, but they have        

1700
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:01,871
adapted the technology          

1701
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,740
from the Mars Rover and made    

1702
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:05,308
an Earth Rover car, called      

1703
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:07,644
the Modular Robotic Vehicle.    

1704
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:09,412
Pretty catchy, huh?             

1705
00:44:09,513 --> 00:44:10,780
The MRV, for short,             

1706
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:11,814
is incredibly nimble            

1707
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:12,615
and designed with               

1708
00:44:12,716 --> 00:44:14,050
urban driving in mind.          

1709
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,218
It's completely electronic,     

1710
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,452
allowing for remote control     

1711
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:18,287
and even full autonomy.         

1712
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:19,188
It has a top speed              

1713
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:20,723
of 43 miles an hour             

1714
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:21,457
and can hold a charge           

1715
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:24,060
for 62 miles.                   

1716
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,094
But the coolest feature         

1717
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:26,195
adapted from the Rover          

1718
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:27,363
is its four independently       

1719
00:44:27,464 --> 00:44:28,898
actuated wheels,                

1720
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:29,666
each with its own               

1721
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:30,867
steering system,                

1722
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:31,968
allowing them to rotate         

1723
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:34,404
180 degrees and sneak into some 

1724
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,539
pretty tight parking spaces.    

1725
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,840
However, you're probably        

1726
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:38,708
more likely to see this thing   

1727
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:39,709
on another planet,              

1728
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:40,376
where there's always            

1729
00:44:40,477 --> 00:44:41,277
plenty of parking,              

1730
00:44:41,378 --> 00:44:41,944
there's really not              

1731
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:43,813
that much trouble.              

1732
00:45:17,981 --> 00:45:19,248
    I had a heart problem.      

1733
00:45:19,284 --> 00:45:21,317
     I was told to begin my     
       Aspirin regimen,         

1734
00:45:21,369 --> 00:45:22,318
   and I just didn't listen.    

1735
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:24,404
  Until I almost lost my life.  

1736
00:45:24,439 --> 00:45:26,706
    My doctors again ordered    
      me to take Aspirin,       

1737
00:45:26,741 --> 00:45:27,707
           and I do.

    or psoriatic arthritis.

  a once-daily pill for adults

00:46:15,623 --> 00:46:19,008
    rheumatoid arthritis or     
   active psoriatic arthritis   

1763
00:46:19,043 --> 00:46:21,461

      not work well enough.     

1764
00:46:21,463 --> 00:46:23,662
          It can reduce         
         pain, swelling,        

1765
00:46:23,664 --> 00:46:26,299

       physical function.       

1766
00:46:26,301 --> 00:46:28,134
         XELJANZ XR can

the rubber pushes the fluid,    

1919

2171
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:44,713
>> No, no.                      

2172
00:59:44,814 --> 00:59:45,514
You know, if you had told me    

2173
00:59:45,615 --> 00:59:46,882
50 years ago I'd get            

2174
00:59:46,983 --> 00:59:49,618
asphyxiated with Gene Winfield  

2175
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:51,186
in the car I dreamed about      

2176
00:59:51,287 --> 00:59:52,454
when I was 15 years old,        

2177
00:59:52,555 --> 00:59:53,622
it's pretty amazing.            

2178
00:59:53,723 --> 00:59:54,289
>> Well, thank you.             

2179
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:55,524
>> Yeah, but it really is.      

2180
00:59:58,595 --> 00:59:59,227
Doesn't get any cooler          

2181
00:59:59,329 --> 01:00:01,363
than that.                      

2182
01:00:01,464 --> 01:00:02,798
So why is space so important    

2183
01:00:02,899 --> 01:00:03,699
to the automobile?              

2184
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,467
>> Hold on. This is major.      

2185
01:00:05,568 --> 01:00:06,468
This is deep.                   

2186
01:00:06,569 --> 01:00:07,669
>> Well, it revolutionized      

2187
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:08,337
styling...                      

2188
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:09,671
This looks like the thrusters   

2189
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:11,406
from a jet, coming out the back.

2190
01:00:11,507 --> 01:00:12,841
Modernized technology...        

2191
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:14,309
>> Now you've got a mean,       

2192
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:15,577
fighting machine.               

2193
01:00:15,678 --> 01:00:16,578
>> And helped influence         

2194
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:17,579
some of the most expensive      

2195
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,081
and advanced machinery          

2196
01:00:19,182 --> 01:00:19,848
in the world.                   

2197
01:00:19,982 --> 01:00:20,648
[w
