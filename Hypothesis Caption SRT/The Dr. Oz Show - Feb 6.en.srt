379

 Once-monthly Emgality is used  
 for the prevention             

380
00:14:17,722 --> 00:14:18,955
     of migraine in adults.

00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:22,725
    more migraine-free days.    

383
00:14:22,961 --> 00:14:26,195
 With Emgality about 60% of     
 people had their migraine days 

384
00:14:26,231 --> 00:14:27,463
      cut in half or more.      

385
00:14:27,565 --> 00:14:30,399
Do not use if you are allergic  
to Emgality or its ingredients. 

386
00:14:31,636 --> 00:14:33,669
  Emgality may cause allergic   
  reactions, such as            

387
00:14:33,705 --> 00:14:35,771
    itching, rash, hives and    
    trouble breathing,          

388
00:14:35,807 --> 00:14:37,306
which can happen days after use.

   imagine the possibilities.   

1481
00:54:14,615 --> 00:54:17,583
 Once-monthly Emgality is used  
 for the prevention             

1482
00:54:17,618 --> 00:54:18,851

    more migraine-free days.    

1485
00:54:22,857 --> 00:54:26,092
 With Emgality about 60% of     
 people had their migraine days

00:54:26,127 --> 00:54:27,360
      cut in half or more.      

1487
00:54:27,462 --> 00:54:30,296
Do not use if you are allergic  
to Emgality or its ingredients. 

1488
00:54:31,532 --> 00:54:33,566
  Emgality may cause allergic   
  reactions, such as            

1489
00:54:33,601 --> 00:54:35,668
    itching, rash, hives and    
    trouble breathing,
