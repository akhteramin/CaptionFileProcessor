   lowered their blood sugar

      Serious side effects

   a sulfonylurea or insulin    

1758
00:58:55,533 --> 00:58:57,332

      for low blood sugar.      

1759
00:58:57,434 --> 00:58:59,134
Common side effects are nausea,

1762
00:59:02,373 --> 00:59:03,939
       Some side effects        
    can lead to dehydration,    

1763
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:06,275
        which may worsen

     My experience with USAA    

1768
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:17,469
       has been excellent.

     the military family
