RUNNING AROUND, DELIBERATELY    
DISTORTING AND MAKING STUFF UP  

343
00:10:48,868 --> 00:10:52,236
DISTORTING AND MAKING STUFF UP  
TO MAKE AMERICA LOOK BAD, WHEN  

344
00:10:52,238 --> 00:10:55,306
TO MAKE AMERICA LOOK BAD, WHEN  
YOU LOOK AT THE SHIFT TO THE

SPIRIT AND SOUL OF THIS         

348
00:11:05,118 --> 00:11:05,449
SPIRIT AND SOUL OF THIS         
COUNTRY.                        

349
00:11:05,451 --> 00:11:06,250

AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM.        

351
00:11:06,853 --> 00:11:07,518
AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM.        
I BELIEVE IN THAT AND YET       

352
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,152
I BELIEVE IN THAT AND YET       
DEMOCRATS ARE EMBARRASSED       

353
00:11:08,154 --> 00:11:09,720
DEMOCRATS ARE EMBARRASSED       
ABOUT THE COUNTRY, THERE

WRAPPED HIMSELF IN THE FLAG.    

357
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:20,331
