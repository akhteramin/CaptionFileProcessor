 Coach! It's kinda hard to see  
 the ball.                      

1530
00:40:32,697 --> 00:40:35,298
       I've been there.         

1531
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:38,535
 I had a TV service with hardly 
 any sports in 4K.              

1532
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:40,703
Couldn't see any of the quality 
details.                        

1533
00:40:40,739 --> 00:40:44,407
I switched to DIRECTV, now I get
the most live sports in 4K.     

1534
00:40:44,443 --> 00:40:46,342
   So how does that help me?    

1535
00:40:46,378 --> 00:40:47,477
      It really doesn't.        

1536
00:40:47,512 --> 00:40:49,712
  I don't know why I told you   
  that. Go get 'em sport!
