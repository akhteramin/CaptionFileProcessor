00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,159
OR TWO HOURS.                   

114
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,327
AND I CAN'T                     
BE PRETENDING                   

115
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,629

FAIRY-TALE FANTASY

IS CHILL WITH YOU               

117
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,299
IN A CASTLE WITH OUR            
 HORSES OR WHATEVER.            
                       HORSES?

        OF A BREAKUP?           

128
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,185
IT'S JUST ME                    
BEING HONEST.                   

129
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,021
        WELL, ... YOUR HONESTY.

138
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:09,100
MAYBE I'M CONFUSED.

            WAS AN IDIOT.       

255
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,945
            I ASKED MY KIDS,    
            "WHAT'D YOU DO      
            WHILE I WAS GONE?"

THE EDGE OF THE EARTH.          

307
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,387
THERE'S NO ANSWER IN            
THE DARK, DARK UNIVERSE.        

308
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:37,755
                THE WORLD ISN'T 
                FLAT, NYA.      

309
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,056
MINE IS, LAURIE.                
IT'S FLAT.                      

310
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:40,291
IT'S COMING TO                  
A QUICK AND FAST END,           

311
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:41,492
AND I CAN'T STOP IT.            

312
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:42,927
                 YES, YOU CAN.  
                YOU JUST GOTTA  

313
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,628
            GRAB IT BY THE BALLS
             AND TURN IT AROUND.

314
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,864
            THAT SON OF YOURS   
            NEEDS A SWIFT KICK  
            IN THE ASS.         

315
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,899
THAT'S NOT WHAT                 
HE NEEDS, LAURIE.               

316
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,134
            I REMEMBER          
            WHEN PARENTS        
            USED TO GIVE US     

317
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:51,635
             PERMISSION TO SPANK
            THEIR KIDS IN CLASS.

318
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:52,803
            YOU OLD ENOUGH      
            TO REMEMBER THAT?   

319
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:54,004
WE TEACH TEENAGERS.             

320
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:55,339
            ESPECIALLY          
            THE TEENAGERS.      

321
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:56,507
YEAH, I DON'T THINK             
I REMEMBER THAT.                

322
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:59,577
            THAT WAS THE BEST.  
            I'M TELLING YOU.    

323
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:04,315
            I HAD THIS ONE KID. 
            LOUIE GASPACHO.     

324
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:05,649
            I REMEMBER HIM      
            REAL GOOD.          

325
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:06,684
            YOU KNOW HOW SOME OF
            THEM STAY WITH YOU  

326
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:08,319
            FOR A LIFETIME?     

327
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:10,621
            WELL, HE HAD KIND OF
            A SCHIZOPHRENIA     
            THING GOING ON.     

328
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:14,592
          UNDIAGNOSED,          
           BUT I KNEW.          

329
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:16,527
            YOU KNOW,           
            THEY SHOULD LET US  
            PRESCRIBE THE DRUGS 

330
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,596
            INSTEAD OF THESE    
            BOGUS DOCTORS.      

331
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:20,231
            I KNOW THESE KIDS   
            INSIDE AND OUT.     

332
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:23,334
            I KNEW LOUIE.       
            ANOTHER KID I THINK 
            RITALIN RUINED.     

333
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:24,869
            BUT HIS FOLKS       
            LISTENED TO THAT    

334
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:27,738
            SORRY EXCUSE        
            OF A COUNSELOR--    
            MS. ESSELMAN--      

335
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,074
OH! UHH!                        
           WHO WOULD RECOMMEND  
           A DRUG TO JESUS      

336
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:32,977
               IF SHE COULDN'T  
            GET HIM TO SIT STILL
               FOR 5 MINUTES.   

337
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,678
            NEVER FIGURED MAYBE 
            IT WAS HER TACTICS  

338
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,413
            AND NOT THE KID,    
            BUT WHATEVER.       

339
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:38,048
HIS FOLKS WOULD                 
NEVER GET HIM TESTED            

340
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,517
FOR HIS                         
MENTAL HEALTH.                  

341
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,851
            COULDN'T AFFORD     
            THE MEDICAL BILLS.  

342
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:43,387
            HALF THESE DAMN KIDS
            ARE SUFFERING FROM  
            MENTAL ILLNESS.     

343
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:44,855
            THAT'S THE REAL     
            PROBLEM HERE.       

344
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:46,390
            THE CLASSROOM       
            CAN'T FIX THAT ...  

345
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:47,558
            AND NEITHER CAN     
            RITALIN.            

346
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,059
        BUT WHAT DO THEY KNOW?  
         NOTHING, THAT'S WHAT.  

347
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:50,528
            I KNOW WHAT THESE   
            KIDS NEED, BUT      

348
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,997
            WHO LISTENS TO ME?  

349
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,465
        ANYWAY, WHAT THE HELL   
        WAS I TALKING ABOUT?    

350
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:55,833
    LOUIE--                     

351
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,134
LOUIE GASPACHO.                 

352
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:58,736
        EXACTLY. SO, HE COULD   
        BE A REAL TERROR        

353
00:13:58,738 --> 00:13:59,904
        IF HE WAS HAVING A DAY. 

354
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:01,438
            SO, ONE TIME HE     
            THREW A BOOK AT ME. 

355
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,907
            NEARLY KNOCKED OUT  
            THE SMART LITTLE    

356
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:04,308
            WEST INDIAN GIRL    
            THAT SAT...         

357
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,576
I DON'T THINK YOU               
SHOULD CALL HER THAT.           

358
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:07,077
            I GRABBED HIS       
            LITTLE SCRAWNY ASS  

359
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:08,345
        IN THE MIDDLE OF CLASS. 

360
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,413
            [SLAPS TABLE]       

361
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,048
            GAVE HIM 3 LICKS    
            TO HIS BACKSIDE.    

362
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,150
            NEVER A BOOK        
            THROWN AGAIN.       

363
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:16,086
            THAT KID GOT ALMOST 
            STRAIGHT As         
            THAT YEAR.          

364
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:17,488
            BUT THEY DON'T      
            GIVE ME MY CREDIT   
            FOR THAT            

365
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,989
            BECAUSE HE WAS      
            INSTITUTIONALIZED   

366
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:21,725
            A COUPLE YEARS      
            LATER AND--         

367
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:23,561
            PULLED OUT          
            OF SCHOOL,          
            SO IT WAS LIKE      

368
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:24,962
            HE NEVER EXISTED,   
            BUT I HAD HIM       

369
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:26,397
            FUNCTIONING HIGH,   
            YOU KNOW.           

370
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,566
            A GOOD OLD          
            ASS WHIPPING        
            CAN TEACH A LOT.    

371
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:29,967
THAT'S NOT O's                  
PROBLEM, LAURIE.                

372
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,368
            OH, NO. I           
            WASN'T SAYING THAT. 

373
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,736
IT'S TOO MANY THINGS.           
IT'S ME. I'M THE SOURCE,        

374
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:33,837
AND I KNOW IT.                  

375
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,007
AND, LOOK, I CAN'T              
KEEP TALKING ABOUT THIS         

376
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,609
IF I'M GONNA GET THROUGH        
THE REST OF THE DAY, OK?        

377
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:39,944
I GOTTA DRIVE UPSTATE           
AFTER WORK,                     

378
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:41,512
PICK HIM UP.                    

379
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:42,746
I'LL FINISH                     
STRESSING THEN.                 

380
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:44,148
            DON'T PANIC, HONEY. 

381
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,583
            WE'RE ALL A BUNCH   
            OF SCREW-UPS        

382
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:46,917
            TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
            OUR MESS.           

383
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:47,918
                YOU'LL FIGURE   
                IT OUT.         

384
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,220
SCREW-UPS? REALLY?              

385
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,387
            IT'S A FIGURE       
            OF SPEECH.          

386
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,356
        DON'T TAKE IT LITERAL-- 
        IT'S NOT LITERAL.       

387
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,458
RIGHT!                          
                       OH!      

388
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,660
                LADIES.         
                WHAT IT DO?     

389
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:58,028

                    YOU SEXY    
                    BASTARD.    

391
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,199
        YOU TRYING TO           
        GET ME IN TROUBLE       

392

        AGAIN, LAURIE?          

393
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:04,768
            JUST A LITTLE       
            FLIRTATION BETWEEN  

394
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,370

            SECURITY GUARD

            OLD TEACHER.        

396
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:11,208
            IT'S HARMLESS.      

397
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:15,145

399
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:19,116
            CAN'T KEEP A WHITE  
            CHICK DOWN.         

400
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:20,985
    GLAD TO HAVE YOU BACK.

402
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,457
OH, HEY, DUN.

    ONE OF MY FAVORITE POEMS    
    BY GWENDOLYN BROOKS--       

510
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:32,762
        "WE REAL COOL.          
        POOL PLAYERS--          

511
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:34,097
    7 AT THE GOLDEN SHOVEL."    

512
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:36,366
                WE REAL COOL.   

513
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:38,268
   NOW, I WANT YOU TO LOOK      
AT THIS POEM IN BOTH VERSIONS   

514
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,437
THAT I'M SHARING WITH YOU.      

515
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:42,339
    NOTICE THIS LAYOUT.         
               WE LEFT SCHOOL.  

516
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:43,507
         THESE ARE FROM         
         TWO PUBLISHERS.        

517

    ONE, HARPERCOLLINS,         

518
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:46,576

     WHITE AMERICAN COMPANY,    

519

        AND THE OTHER,          
        BROADSIDE PRESS,        

520
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:50,947
        ONE OF THE FIRST        
        MAJOR PUBLISHERS        

521
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:52,415
           OF BLACK             
    REVOLUTIONARY WRITERS.      

522
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,450
                WE LURK LATE.   

523
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,118
        REVOLUTIONARY.          
        COME ON, TIFFANY.       

524
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,519
    YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.   

525
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:58,755
         THINK ABOUT IT.        

526
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,625
        YES. CHANGE.            

527
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:03,059
       THANK YOU FOR            
    THE ASSIST, TOMIKA.         

528
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:04,227
                    WE STRIKE   
                    STRAIGHT.   

529
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:05,996
             NOW, IN            
   THE HARPERCOLLINS VERSION,   

530
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:07,898
     LAYOUT'S PRETTY COMMON.    

531
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,466
        LARGE TITLES,           

532
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:11,935
    WORDS AT THE BEGINNING OF   
    EACH STANZA CAPITALIZED.    

533
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,571
    THERE'S ALMOST AN ATTEMPT   
        TO ERASE THE IDEA       

534
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:17,207
    THAT THE PIECE IS WRITTEN   
       IN BROKEN ENGLISH.       

535
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:18,375
                    WE SING SIN.

536
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:20,243
   BUT IN THE BROADSIDE PRESS   
            VERSION,            

537
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:23,713
    THE FONT LOOKS LIKE         
    GRAFFITI WRITING,           

538
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:25,415
    NOT WHAT WE NORMALLY        
    SEE IN OUR TEXTBOOK.        

539
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:26,716
    THAT'S RIGHT, DeSHAWN.      

540
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:29,986
    BECAUSE GRAFFITI WRITING    
         REPS THE 'HOOD.        

541
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:31,755
    AND I WOULD AGREE.          

542
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:33,023
        IT DOESN'T GET          
        THE SAME RESPECT.       

543
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:34,324
                WE THIN GIN.    

544
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:37,294
    SO, WHY DO YOU THINK        
    THIS INDEPENDENT BLACK PRESS

545
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,195
   DECIDED TO LAY OUT THE POEM  

546
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:41,331
     IN THIS BROKEN GRAFFITI    
             STYLE?             

547
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,200
   WHAT ARE THEY SAYING ABOUT   
   RULES AND STRUCTURE?         

548
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:45,902
    WHAT ARE THEY SAYING        

549
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:47,470
    ABOUT THE EDUCATION         
    OF YOUNG MEN                

550
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,471
        IN THIS POEM?           

551
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,639
WE JAZZ JUNE.                   

552
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,907
    POOL PLAYERS IN THIS        
     POEM ARE TEENAGERS.        

553
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:52,676
    WHAT IF I TOLD YOU          

554
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:55,912
    IT WAS THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY
    ON A SCHOOL DAY?            

555
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:57,781
    WHAT ARE THEY DOING         
    AT A POOL HALL              

556
00:21:57,783 --> 00:21:58,915
        ON A SCHOOL DAY?        

557
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:00,483
                    WE DIE.     
                    D--D--      

558
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:01,718
         SO, MS. BROOKS         
        IS TALKING ABOUT        
         SOMETHING HERE.        

559
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,986
        SHE'S SAYING THEY       
        SKIPPING SCHOOL,        

560
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:06,356
   HANGING AROUND BARS,         
   THINNING GIN, JAZZING JUNE.  

561
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:09,626
    YES, DARNELL, JUNE IS       
       A GIRL'S NAME.           

562
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,531
   SO, "JAZZING JUNE" MEANS--   

563
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:15,765
        OK, PAUL, I THINK       
        YOU COULD COME UP       

564
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,133
    WITH A BETTER PHRASE, BUT   

565
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:19,135
     "LAYING THAT PIMP GAME"    
        WILL DO FOR NOW.        

566
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:20,670
                WE REAL COOL.   

567
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,173
    NOW, SOME MIGHT LOOK AT     
    THE BROADSIDE PRESS VERSION,

568
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,741
    THINK IT'S INVALID          

569
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:25,875
    'CAUSE IT DOESN'T           
    FOLLOW THE RULES OF         

570
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:27,110
    ENGLISH GRAMMATICAL         
        STRUCTURE.              

571
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:28,678
               WE LEFT SCHOOL.  
LOOKS LIKE STREET WRITING.      

572
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,548
OMARI: WE LURK LATE.            
   BUT SOMETIMES RULES          

573
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,716
     ARE MEANT TO BE BROKEN.    

574
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:33,750
WE STRIKE STRAIGHT.             

575
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:35,752
    SOMETIMES, THE STREET       

576
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:37,087
   HAS VALUABLE LESSONS, TOO.   

577
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,455
WE SING SIN.                    

578
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:39,889
       NOW, MS. BROOKS          
       HAS HER OWN RULES.       

579
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:41,324
WE THIN GIN.                    

580
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:43,526
    SHE BREAKS UP THE "WE"      
       BEFORE EACH LINE         

581
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,928
    BECAUSE SHE WANTS US        
          TO PAUSE.             

582
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,896
WE...JAZZ JUNE.                 

583
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:49,799
    SHE WANTS US TO THINK       
       ABOUT THAT "WE"          

584
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:50,900
    BEFORE THE NEXT LINE.       

585
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:52,602
WE...DI--DI--DI...              

586
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:53,903
    EACH "WE" QUESTIONS         

587
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:55,705
   THEIR EXISTENCE AND WORTH.   

588
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,674
WE...DI--DI--DI...              

589
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:59,242
    BECAUSE WHO ARE THEY        
       AT POOL HALLS?           

590
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:02,078
    SKIPPING SCHOOL,            
    DRINKING, HAVING SEX,       

591
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,346
        HANGING LATE.           

592
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:06,549
    WHAT WILL THEY BECOME?      

593
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,785
WE...                           
       GWENDOLYN BROOKS         
       GIVES US THE ANSWER      

594
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:09,919
        ON HER LAST LINE.       

595
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:12,655
WE...                           
       A LINE THAT              
       HAUNTS US ALL.           

596
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:13,756
    WE...                       
           A LINE THAT          
           WILL BECOME          

597
00:23:13,758 --> 00:23:15,258
        THEIR EPITHET.          
                       WE...    

598
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,060
         BOTH: WE DIE...        

599
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,161
        NYA: SOON.              

600
00:23:22,767 --> 00:23:24,634
WHAT?                           
                   I SAID,      

601
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:26,035
                "WE DIE SOON."  

602
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:38,548
   I SEEM TO HAVE FORGOTTEN--   

603
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,050
    UH, CAN'T FIND MY PLACE--   

604
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:44,020
    NO, NO, I'M FINE, SHAWNA.   

605
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:46,122
        THANK YOU.              
        I THINK THAT'S          
        ENOUGH OF THAT--        

606
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:49,425
        OH, FOR TODAY.          
        UH, SORRY.              

607
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:50,627
    I'M GONNA STEP OUT.         

608
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:51,794
        YOU CAN WORK            
        SILENTLY, OK?           

609
00:23:51,796 --> 00:23:53,329
    WORK ON YOUR OWN            
    RESPONSE TO THE POEM.       

610
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:54,764
    I'M GONNA STEP OUT.         

611
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:55,899
    PLEASE DON'T GET            
    OUT OF YOUR SEATS.          

612
00:23:55,901 --> 00:24:00,103
        DARNELL, PAUL.          
        I'M SERIOUS.            

613
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:05,742
        THANK YOU.              

614
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:12,582
            [CRYING]            

615
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:21,824
            OHH.

YEAH. I'M FINE.

620
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:28,264
NO. YEAH.

00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:36,712
            MISS, I DON'T KNOW. 

726
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:39,749
OK. I HEAR THAT.                
IT'S JUST THAT                  

727
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:41,650
YOU'RE THE PERSON               
HE TALKS TO THE MOST.           

728
00:28:41,652 --> 00:28:42,885
DID YOU KNOW THAT?              
                       AM I?    

729
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,854
ABSOLUTELY.                     
THE MOST.                       

730
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:46,822
AND IF ANYBODY,                 
IF ANYONE WOULD                 
KNOW HIS PLAN,                  

731
00:28:46,824 --> 00:28:49,625
MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE           
IN THE WORLD,                   

732
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:51,594
IT WOULD BE...                  
                       ME?      

733
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:53,596
EXACTLY.                        
           WOW. THAT'S REAL.    

734
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:54,797
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE            
A BIG DEAL OF THIS              

735
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:55,831
TO THE SCHOOL                   
RIGHT NOW.                      

736
00:28:55,833 --> 00:28:56,866
HE'S SUPPOSED                   
TO GET HIS THINGS,              

737
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:58,267
BE WAITING                      
FOR ME DOWNSTAIRS.              

738
00:28:58,269 --> 00:28:59,902
THAT'S OUR                      
NORMAL ROUTINE.                 

739
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,404
HIS COUNSELOR                   
LEFT HIM                        

740
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,172
TO GO PACK HIS BAG,             

741
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:04,507
BUT NOW NO OMARI,               

742
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:06,609
AND IF I ASK                    
 THE SCHOOL,                    

743
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:07,977
THEY'RE GONNA SOUND             
AN ALARM,                       

744
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:10,312
MAKE MORE OF A PROBLEM,         
AND WHATEVER TROUBLE            
OMARI IS IN,                    

745
00:29:10,314 --> 00:29:11,614
HE'LL BE FACED                  
WITH MORE.                      

746
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:12,882
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?           

747
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:15,718
        GOD, MISS JOSEPH,       
        THEY'RE UNREASONABLE!   

748
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,219
    OK. W--WHAT DOES            
       THAT MEAN?               

749
00:29:17,221 --> 00:29:19,855
HE'S NOT A CRIMINAL.            
               I KNOW THAT.     

750
00:29:19,857 --> 00:29:21,457
            I DON'T THINK HE'S  
            A CRIMINAL, EITHER. 

751
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:22,858
            I JUST WANT TO KNOW 
            WHERE HE IS.        

752
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:25,661
SOMETIMES, PEOPLE               
PUSH YOU TOO FAR.               

753
00:29:25,663 --> 00:29:27,062
THEY MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE         
A ANIMAL                        

754
00:29:27,064 --> 00:29:28,864
FROM ANOTHER JUNGLE,            
LIKE YOU DON'T BELONG           

755
00:29:28,866 --> 00:29:30,399
EVEN WHEN YOU'RE HERE,          
'CAUSE THEY GOT EXPECTATIONS    

756
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:31,534
THAT YOU OF THE WILD.           

757
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:32,968
SO, YOU BECOME                  
THAT EXPECTATION,               

758
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,036
BUT IT AIN'T BORN               
IN YOU, YOU KNOW                
WHAT I'M SAYING?                

759
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:35,504
IT'S NOT WHAT                   
YOU WANT TO BE.                 

760
00:29:35,506 --> 00:29:36,939
IT'S WHAT YOU BECOME. THAT'S    
THE CRAZY OF FERNBROOK.         

761
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:37,973
                    JASMINE.    

762
00:29:37,975 --> 00:29:39,241
HE'S MY HEART,                  
MISS J. I LOVE HIM.             

763
00:29:39,243 --> 00:29:40,342
                THEN TELL ME    
                WHERE HE IS.    

764
00:29:40,344 --> 00:29:41,811
I AIN'T NO SNITCH.              

765
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:43,612
                SNITCH?         

766
00:29:43,614 --> 00:29:45,247
I STILL COME FROM               
WHAT I COME FROM.               

767
00:29:45,249 --> 00:29:46,382
THIS PLACE DON'T                
CHANGE THAT.                    

768
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:47,349
            JASMINE, YOU KNOW   
            WHERE HE WENT.      

769
00:29:47,351 --> 00:29:48,384
NOT EXACTLY ANYWAY.             

770
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:50,019
            OK, WHAT DO--WHAT   
            DOES THAT MEAN?     

771
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:52,087
I GOT IDEAS IF I'M              
IN HIS HEAD RIGHT,              

772
00:29:52,089 --> 00:29:53,522
BUT I DON'T KNOW                
NOTHING FOR SURE.               

773
00:29:53,524 --> 00:29:54,557
                OK, GIVE ME SOME
                IDEAS HERE.     

774
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:55,658
I CAN'T DO THAT.                

775
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,826
                DON'T ASK ME.   
                PLEASE, MISS.   

776
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:57,993
                I'M NOT         
                HIS BETRAYER.   

777
00:29:57,995 --> 00:30:00,229
BETRAY--WHOO--                  
 OOH, JASMINE.                  

778
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:09,004
TRYING TO BE CALM.              
 I'M TRYING NOT TO              
 UNRAVEL, UNLEASH.              

779
00:30:09,006 --> 00:30:10,706
                 I DON'T WANT TO
                SEE YOU UNLEASH.

780
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:13,943
THIS ISN'T AN ACT               
OF LOYALTY, NOT FOR REAL.       

781
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:15,878
IN YOUR HEAD, MAYBE,            
BUT IN REALITY,                 

782
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,847
IN REALITY, YOU'RE              
SENTENCING HIM TO AN--          

783
00:30:20,651 --> 00:30:22,251
I NEED TO FIND HIM.             

784
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:23,719
         YOU LOOK REAL          
         STRESSED, MISS.        

785
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:25,087
    OK, I'M VERY STRESSED.      

786
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:26,155
        HE'S MY SON.            

787
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:27,723
            I UNDERSTAND.       

788
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:30,025
            I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS
            LIKE TO LOVE HIM    
            HARD, BELIEVE ME.   

789
00:30:30,027 --> 00:30:31,126
    DO YOU?                     

790
00:30:31,128 --> 00:30:32,294
            HIS UNPREDICTABILITY
            IS MANIC.           

791
00:30:32,296 --> 00:30:34,163
            IT'S EXCRUCIATING   
            SOMETIMES,          

792
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,765
    LIKE NAILS GOING STRAIGHT   
    THROUGH THE HEART MUSCLE,   

793
00:30:36,767 --> 00:30:38,133
    BUT INSIDE YOU KNOW         
    HE'S LIKE AN INFANT         

794
00:30:38,135 --> 00:30:39,902
        NEEDING SOME KIND       
        OF NURTURE,             

795
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:41,704
     AND THERE'S A SWEETNESS    
     TO HIM THAT MAKES          
     YOU WANT TO GIVE IT.       

796
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:43,072
     IT MAKES YOU WANT TO       
     GIVE UP EVERYTHING JUST    
     TO HOLD HIM TIGHT.         

797
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:46,075
JASMINE, THIS ISN'T HELPING.    

798
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:48,143
        DID YOU EVER            
        LIKE ME, MISS?          

799
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:51,580
    WHAT?                       

800
00:30:51,582 --> 00:30:53,449
       WHEN I'D COME OVER,      

801
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:54,783
    YOU HARDLY EVER REALLY--    

802
00:30:54,785 --> 00:30:55,985
      IT'S LIKE YOU WAS         
      POLITE BUT NOT NICE.      

803
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:57,052
        I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.  
           I DON'T SEE WHAT     

804
00:30:57,054 --> 00:30:58,587
                THIS HAS TO DO  
                WITH FINDING--  

805
00:30:58,589 --> 00:31:00,155
I'M NOT TRYING TO               
GRILL YOU OR NOTHING.           

806
00:31:00,157 --> 00:31:02,391
I JUST WAS ALWAYS CURIOUS.      

807
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:05,561
LIKE IT WAS SOMETHING WRONG     
I DID I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT--     

808
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:07,596
SAT IN YOUR FAVORITE            
CHAIR ONCE,                     

809
00:31:07,598 --> 00:31:10,432
DRANK THE LAST OF SOME JUICE    
I DIDN'T KNOW WAS NEAR EMPTY.   

810
00:31:10,434 --> 00:31:13,168
LIKE IF IT WAS SOME             
ACTION OF MINE                  

811
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:14,703
OR JUST MY PRESENCE ALONE.      

812
00:31:14,705 --> 00:31:16,271
I'D UNDERSTAND EITHER WAY,      
JUST ALWAYS WONDERED.           

813
00:31:16,273 --> 00:31:17,506
            JASMINE.            

814
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:18,540
      I DON'T DISLIKE YOU.      

815
00:31:18,542 --> 00:31:19,942
YEAH.                           

816
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:22,311
BUT YOU DON'T LIKE ME,          
EITHER, RIGHT?                  

817
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:24,513
I MEAN, I DON'T DISLIKE YOU.    

818
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:27,316
THAT'S LIKE                     
PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE, SORT OF.    

819
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:29,852
 IT'S NOT COMMITTING            
TO LOVING OR HATING.            

820
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:31,453
IT'S ALMOST WORSE,              
 LIKE INDIFFERENT.              

821
00:31:31,455 --> 00:31:33,222
            IT'S HARD TO LIKE   
            SOMEONE...          

822
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:36,325
    IT'S HARD TO LIKE           
    SOMEONE YOU DON'T KNOW      

823
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:38,027
    BEYOND A FEW HELLOS.        

824
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,962
SOMEONE SMART                   
AND CUTE MOST DAYS.             

825
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:41,430
            STILL SOMEONE       
            YOU DON'T KNOW.     

826
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:44,333
SOMEONE WITH A HEART SO BIG,    
THE SKY COULDN'T HOLD IT.       

827
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:46,635
        SOMEONE WHO I'M SURE IS 
        GREAT IN HER OWN WAY.   

828
00:31:46,637 --> 00:31:48,404
SOMEONE DEFINITELY GREAT        
IN EVERY WAY.                   

829
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,572
            OK.                 

830
00:31:51,942 --> 00:31:53,742
                SURE.           

831
00:31:53,744 --> 00:31:55,344
BUT SOMEONE ALSO                
DATING YOUR SON.                
                    MY ONLY SON.

832
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:57,680
EXACTLY.                        

833
00:31:57,682 --> 00:31:59,982
LIKE THE WAY YOU                
 JUST SAID THAT.                

834
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:02,317
I MEAN, THAT WAS                
 KIND OF LIKE...                

835
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:03,752
THAT WAS ALMOST A THREAT.       

836
00:32:03,754 --> 00:32:05,387
                    UHH.        

837
00:32:05,389 --> 00:32:06,622
            WHAT DO YOU MEAN?   

838
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:08,791
LIKE...                         

839
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:11,760
AND, EXCUSE MY LANGUAGE,        
PLEASE, BUT IT WAS LIKE,        

840
00:32:11,762 --> 00:32:13,729
"YEAH, BITCH, THAT'S            
MY ONLY SON,                    

841
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:16,031
AND YOU'RE TRYING TO TAKE HIM   
FROM ME OR WHATEVER."           

842
00:32:17,968 --> 00:32:20,636
I SAID, "EXCUSE                 
MY LANGUAGE, PLEASE."           
I HOPE YOU HEARD THAT PART.     

843
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:23,205
        YEAH, I HEARD THAT PART.
        HEARD IT.               

844
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:26,208
                AHEM.           

845
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,510
        JASMINE, DO YOU HAVE    
        ANY BROTHERS OR SISTERS?

846
00:32:28,512 --> 00:32:29,812
THIS LIKE                       
A BONDING QUESTION              

847
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:30,946
OR INTERROGATION                
QUESTION?                       

848
00:32:30,948 --> 00:32:33,715
            WHATEVER KIND       
            GETS AN ANSWER.     

849
00:32:33,717 --> 00:32:36,452
I'M AN ONLY CHILD LIKE O.       
WE CONNECT THAT WAY.            

850
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,053
                I SEE.          

851
00:32:38,055 --> 00:32:40,089
BUT I GOT AN OLDER COUSIN       
AND ONE YOUNGER, BOTH BOYS.     

852
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:41,690
THEY'RE LIKE BROTHERS           
TO ME SOMETIMES.                

853
00:32:41,692 --> 00:32:44,059
       YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S       
        LIKE TO TAKE CARE       
       OF THEM AS A WOMAN,      

854
00:32:44,061 --> 00:32:45,894
       WORRYING ABOUT WHAT      
       CAN HAPPEN TO THEM       

855
00:32:45,896 --> 00:32:47,763
        WHEN THEY GO OUT INTO   
        THE WORLD EVERY DAY?    

856
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:49,331
UM, THEY JUST                   
MY COUSINS, SO--                

857
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:50,799
        IT'S A GAMBLE,          
        JASMINE, ALL THE TIME.  

858
00:32:50,801 --> 00:32:53,202
        YOU SEND YOUR YOUNG MAN 
        OUT INTO THE WORLD      
        FOR A DAY,              

859
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:56,271
       AWAY FOR A WEEKEND,      
       A SEMESTER,              
       A SCHOOL YEAR,           

860
00:32:56,273 --> 00:33:01,643
        AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA,   
        YOU HAVE NO IDEA        
        IF THEY'RE SAFE.        

861
00:33:01,645 --> 00:33:04,913
       YOU HAVE NO IDEA         
       IF SOMEONE WILL TRY      
       TO EXPIRE THEM           

862
00:33:04,915 --> 00:33:07,583
        BECAUSE THEY'RE         
        TOO YOUNG OR TOO BLACK  
        OR TOO THREATENING,     

863
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:11,553
    TOO LOUD, TOO UNINFORMED,   
    TOO ANGRY, TOO QUIET,       

864
00:33:11,555 --> 00:33:13,455
        TOO EVERYDAY, TOO COOL, 
        TOO UNCOMPOSED,         

865
00:33:13,457 --> 00:33:17,793
         TOO MYSTERIOUS,        
        OR JUST TOO TOO.        

866
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:20,796
        YOU HAVE NO IDEA,       
        AND IT'S FRIGHTENING,   
        JASMINE.                

867
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:23,665
       IT SENDS A TREMBLE       
       THROUGH YOUR HEART       
       ON THE DAILY.            

868
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:25,200
      BUT IF SOMEONE COULD      
      EASE THAT TREMBLE         

869
00:33:25,202 --> 00:33:28,537
        BY UNVEILING JUST       
        A LITTLE PIECE OF       
        THE PUZZLE,             

870
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:31,406
    IT WOULD MEAN EVERYTHING.   

871
00:33:31,408 --> 00:33:32,908
        DO YOU GET ME?          

872
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:35,711
MEN ARE A PUZZLE,               
STRAIGHT UP. I GET YOU.         

873
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:38,480
       SO I KNOW YOU WANT       
        TO PROTECT OMARI.       

874
00:33:38,482 --> 00:33:40,249
         I KNOW YOU CARE        
         FOR HIM DEEPLY.        

875
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:42,251
SO DEEP I GOT                   
INDIGESTION OVER HERE.          

876
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:44,052
        BUT KEEPING HIS         
        WHEREABOUTS A SECRET,   

877
00:33:44,054 --> 00:33:46,421
            THAT'S NOT HELPING  
             HIM, YOU HEAR ME?  

878
00:33:46,423 --> 00:33:47,689
        NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT.  

879
00:33:47,691 --> 00:33:49,925
            WHAT ARE YOU GONNA  
            DO IF YOU KNOW?     

880
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:51,560
            GO FOLLOW HIM,      

881
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:54,529
            CONVINCE HIM NOT TO 
            DO SOMETHING HE SET 
            HIS MIND TO?        

882
00:33:54,531 --> 00:33:56,064
            YOU REALLY THINK    
            THAT'S POSSIBLE?    

883
00:33:56,066 --> 00:33:57,599
I WOULDN'T BE WORTH             
MY SALT AS A MOTHER             
IF I DIDN'T.                    

884
00:33:57,601 --> 00:34:00,269
        MS. JOSEPH,             
        I KNOW YOU THINK        

885
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:02,170
      MAYBE I'M NOT GOOD        
      ENOUGH FOR YOUR SON.      

886
00:34:02,172 --> 00:34:03,972
    MY PARENTS THINK NOBODY'S   
    GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.         

887
00:34:03,974 --> 00:34:05,774
        I GET IT. NOBODY'S      
        GOOD ENOUGH FOR NOBODY. 

888
00:34:05,776 --> 00:34:08,744
      BUT ME AND O, WE GOT      
      SOMETHING REAL.           

889
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:11,013
        AND EVEN IF YOU THINK   
        I'M WORTHLESS, I'M      
        STILL GONNA LOVE HIM.   

890
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:13,415
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE WORTH--    
          NAH, YOU DO.          

891
00:34:13,417 --> 00:34:17,586
       YOU DON'T WANT TO,       
       BUT YOU DO.              

892
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:20,822
        I CAN SMELL WHEN I DON'T
         MAKE SENSE TO SOMEBODY.

893
00:34:20,824 --> 00:34:24,660
        I MAKE YOU AFRAID       
        JUST LIKE O MAKES       
       MY PARENTS AFRAID.       

894
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:28,630
        IT'S LIKE YOU SEND US   
        HERE TO BECOME THESE    
        DIFFERENT PEOPLE.       

895
00:34:28,632 --> 00:34:30,198
        YOU WANT US             
        TO HAVE SO MUCH.        

896
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,667
            YOU WANT TO PROTECT 
            US FROM OURSELVES.  

897
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:35,103
        YOU LOVE US,            
        AND WE KNOW THAT,       
        BUT YOU HATE US, TOO.   

898
00:34:35,105 --> 00:34:37,306
       YOU HATE US HAVING       
       A MIND OF OUR OWN.       

899
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:41,009
        YOU HATE THAT WE CAN'T  
        BE EXACTLY WHAT YOU     
        IMAGINED IN YOUR HEAD,  

900
00:34:41,011 --> 00:34:42,344
      AND THAT SCARES YOU,      

901
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:44,079
         THAT WE DON'T          
        BELONG TO YOU,          

902
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:45,681
    THAT SOMEONE                
    COULD COME ALONG            

903
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:47,749
    AND WE MIGHT LOVE THEM      
    MORE THAN WE LOVE YOU.      

904
00:34:47,751 --> 00:34:50,385
     YOU HATE US FOR THAT.      
    WE CAN FEEL IT INSIDE,      

905
00:34:50,387 --> 00:34:53,422
     AND IT'LL MAKE US LEAVE    
     AND NEVER COME BACK!       

906
00:34:54,925 --> 00:34:58,660
WHERE IS...                     

907
00:34:58,662 --> 00:35:00,362
MY SON?                         

908
00:35:04,668 --> 00:35:05,767
JASMINE.                        

909
00:35:05,769 --> 00:35:07,736
        MAYBE THE TRAIN STATION 
        OR THE BUS.             

910
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:12,374
TO GO WHERE?                    

911
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:13,709
        HE DIDN'T SAY.          

912
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:15,110
        BUT HE SAID IT          
         WAS GOOD-BYE.          

913
00:35:15,112 --> 00:35:16,178
DID SOMEONE COME                
AND PICK HIM UP?                

914
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,946
        HE CAUGHT A RIDE        
        WITH BRIAN.             

915
00:35:17,948 --> 00:35:20,248
        HE TOLD THE COUNSELOR   
         HE WAS COMING UP TO    
        PACK UP HIS CLOTHES.    

916
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:21,950
        THEY LET HIM GO, AND HE 
        SNUCK OUT WITH BRIAN.   

917
00:35:21,952 --> 00:35:23,919
       I TRIED TO CONVINCE      
       HIM NOT TO GO,           

918
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:25,287
       STICK OUT HIS FATE       
       LIKE A MAN,              

919
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,822
        BUT HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE
        A BURDEN NO MORE TO YOU.

920
00:35:26,824 --> 00:35:27,823
WHY WOULD HE BE A--             

921
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:29,825
        THEY VIDEOED HIM, MISS. 

922
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:31,193
      IT'S GONNA GO VIRAL.      

923
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:32,728
        SOMEBODY ALREADY        
         SENT ME A TEXT.        

924
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:33,995
JESUS.                          

925
00:35:33,997 --> 00:35:35,497
    HE THOUGHT HE'D BRING YOU   
         SO MUCH SHAME.         

926
00:35:35,499 --> 00:35:36,531
HE THOUGHT HE'D RUIN YOU.       

927
00:35:36,533 --> 00:35:37,733
     DID HE MENTION A PLACE?    

928
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:39,634
       I NEED TO KNOW NOW.

        WHAT DID I DISCOVER     
        WHEN READING THE TEXT?  

1041
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:30,625
HE'S YOUR TEACHER.              
HE'S SUPPOSED TO ASK YOU        
ABOUT THE TEXT, OMARI.          

1042
00:40:30,627 --> 00:40:32,193
            NAH, HE AIN'T.      

1043
00:40:32,195 --> 00:40:34,395
HE AIN'T JUST QUESTIONING       
ME ABOUT "NATIVE SON."          

1044
00:40:34,397 --> 00:40:36,097
HE AIN'T JUST TALKING TEXT.     

1045
00:40:36,099 --> 00:40:37,865
HE'S SAYING SOMETHING ELSE,     

1046
00:40:37,867 --> 00:40:39,467
SOMETHING BENEATH               
THE QUESTION,                   

1047
00:40:39,469 --> 00:40:41,135
AND IT'S LIKE I'M THE ONLY      
ONE WHO CAN HEAR IT.            

1048
00:40:41,137 --> 00:40:42,537
            THAT DOESN'T        
            GIVE YOU THE RIGHT  
            TO LOSE YOUR COOL.  

1049
00:40:42,539 --> 00:40:44,105
        THAT DOESN'T GIVE YOU   
        THE RIGHT TO BE         
        THE ANIMAL HERE.        

1050
00:40:44,107 --> 00:40:45,506
BUT IT'S ALL HE'S SEEING.       

1051
00:40:45,508 --> 00:40:46,874
WON'T LEAVE ME ALONE.           

1052
00:40:46,876 --> 00:40:48,476
I SAID, "MISTER, DON'T          
PICK ON ME TODAY.               

1053
00:40:48,478 --> 00:40:50,378
I AIN'T GOT NOTHING             
TO OFFER," BUT HE WON'T         
LEAVE ME ALONE.                 

1054
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,980
      A TEACHER'S SUPPOSED      
      TO ENGAGE YOU,            

1055
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:53,548
       EVEN WHEN YOU DON'T      
       FEEL LIKE IT.            

1056
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:54,682
    THAT'S THE TEACHER'S JOB.   

1057
00:40:54,684 --> 00:40:56,617
      NOW, I TOLD YOU THAT      
      REPEATEDLY, OMARI.        

1058
00:40:56,619 --> 00:40:59,020
WE'RE NOT TALKING THE           
TEACHER DOING THEIR JOB.        

1059
00:40:59,022 --> 00:41:01,789
WE TALKING PROVOKING.           
WE TALKING AGITATING.           

1060
00:41:01,791 --> 00:41:05,059
WE TALKING                      
SINGLING ME OUT.                
YOU KNOW THAT, MA?              

1061
00:41:05,061 --> 00:41:07,762
ON A DAY WHERE...               

1062
00:41:07,764 --> 00:41:09,530
WHERE I DON'T FEEL LIKE         
BEING SINGLED OUT.              

1063
00:41:09,532 --> 00:41:10,898
WE TALKING RESPECTING           
MY SPACE.                       

1064
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,100
            NO.                 

1065
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:14,135
       NO, YOU IN SCHOOL.       

1066
00:41:14,137 --> 00:41:15,503
       YOU'RE NOT IN YOUR       
       PERSONAL SPACE.          

1067
00:41:15,505 --> 00:41:17,805
    YOU'RE IN A COLLECTIVE      
    SPACE, A SPACE TO ENGAGE,   

1068
00:41:17,807 --> 00:41:21,642
        TO BE QUESTIONED,       
        TO BE STIMULATED,       
        TO BE PROVOKED.         

1069
00:41:21,644 --> 00:41:23,277
        THAT'S EDUCATION, OMARI.

1070
00:41:23,279 --> 00:41:25,013
I'M TALKING BIASED              
EDUCATION, MA.                  

1071
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:26,514
I'M TALKING DISRESPECT.         

1072
00:41:26,516 --> 00:41:27,782
HE KNOWS.                       

1073
00:41:27,784 --> 00:41:30,218
HE KNOWS                        
HE WAS--                        

1074
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,853
HE WAS                          
SAYING SOMETHING.               

1075
00:41:31,855 --> 00:41:33,654
        ASKING ME IN            
        THAT ROOM IN THAT WAY   

1076
00:41:33,656 --> 00:41:35,723
     IN FRONT OF ALL THOSE      
     STUDENTS ON THAT ISSUE,    

1077
00:41:35,725 --> 00:41:37,158
     HE WAS SAYING SOMETHING    
     DIRECTLY TO ME.            

1078
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,459
        I KNOW HE WAS.          

1079
00:41:38,461 --> 00:41:40,128
EVEN IF HE WAS, EVEN IF,        
WHAT YOU TELLING ME?            

1080
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:42,363
YOU TELLING ME THAT MAKE        
YOU ATTACK YOUR TEACHER?        

1081
00:41:44,033 --> 00:41:46,367
YOU TRYING TO DRAW              
SOME PERPENDICULAR LINE HERE,   

1082
00:41:46,369 --> 00:41:47,902
'CAUSE I'M NOT SEEING           
WHERE THESE THINGS CROSS.       

1083
00:41:47,904 --> 00:41:49,303
        I TOLD HIM TO BACK OFF. 

1084
00:41:49,305 --> 00:41:50,605
YEAH, YOU SAID THAT ALREADY.    

1085
00:41:50,607 --> 00:41:52,106
      I TOLD HIM, MA,           
      AND HE KEPT DIGGING.      

1086
00:41:52,108 --> 00:41:53,141
AND THEN?                       

1087
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:54,475
        AND THEN HE SAYS,       
        "MR. JOSEPH,            

1088
00:41:54,477 --> 00:41:56,577
        "YOUR PERSPECTIVE       
       IS MANDATORY HERE.       

1089
00:41:56,579 --> 00:41:59,247
       TELL THE CLASS YOUR      
       PERSPECTIVE OR TAKE      
      A ZERO FOR THE DAY."      

1090
00:41:59,249 --> 00:42:00,982
STILL NOT SEEING.               
       YOU THREATEN MY GRADES,  

1091
00:42:00,984 --> 00:42:02,817
        YOU THREATEN TO PUNISH  
        ME IN FRONT OF THE CLASS

1092
00:42:02,819 --> 00:42:04,452
         BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO
        BE YOUR TOKEN RESPONDER.

1093
00:42:04,454 --> 00:42:05,486
           THAT'S ...           

1094
00:42:05,488 --> 00:42:08,389
YOU CUSSING LIKE THAT?          

1095
00:42:08,391 --> 00:42:10,324
YOU SAVING THAT DISRESPECT      
FOR ME PERSONALLY.              

1096
00:42:10,326 --> 00:42:12,293
        I'M SORRY, JUST AMPED,  
        MAKING A POINT.         

1097
00:42:12,295 --> 00:42:13,961
NO, BUT YOU HAVEN'T             
MADE A POINT YET, OMARI.        

1098
00:42:13,963 --> 00:42:16,964
YOU HAVEN'T GIVEN ANY           
INDICATION WHY YOUR             
BEHAVIOR WAS WARRANTED.         

1099
00:42:16,966 --> 00:42:18,433
YOU HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING       

1100
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:20,735
EXCEPT SPEAK AS IF              
YOU'RE ABOVE REPROACH.          

1101
00:42:20,737 --> 00:42:22,503
AND YOU'RE NOT.                 

1102
00:42:22,505 --> 00:42:23,571
            FORGET IT, MA.      

1103
00:42:23,573 --> 00:42:25,273
    NO.                         

1104
00:42:25,275 --> 00:42:26,340
LET'S NOT FORGET IT.            

1105
00:42:26,342 --> 00:42:27,708
           NO, LET'S.           

1106
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:30,678
            I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T.

1107
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,013
        I KNEW THIS WAS FUTILE. 

1108
00:42:32,015 --> 00:42:33,181
THIS IS YOUR                    
THIRD STRIKE, OMARI.            

1109
00:42:33,183 --> 00:42:34,882
            THE WORST ONE.      

1110
00:42:36,586 --> 00:42:38,953
            YOU PUT YOUR HANDS  
            ON YOUR TEACHER.    

1111
00:42:38,955 --> 00:42:41,489
        YOU ATTACK YOUR TEACHER?

1112
00:42:41,491 --> 00:42:42,557
I PUSHED HIM.                   
I DIDN'T ATTACK HIM.            

1113
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,091
        YOU THINK THEY CARE     
        ABOUT YOUR SEMANTICS?   

1114
00:42:44,093 --> 00:42:45,793
I PUSHED HIM AND HE FELL        
AGAINST THE BOARD.              

1115
00:42:45,795 --> 00:42:48,296
        YOU SLAMMED A TEACHER   
        AGAINST A BOARD.        

1116
00:42:48,298 --> 00:42:49,463
NOW THAT'S SOME SEMANTICS.      

1117
00:42:49,465 --> 00:42:51,065
       IT WAS RECORDED          
       BY OTHER STUDENTS,       

1118
00:42:51,067 --> 00:42:53,234
        AND NOBODY'S GONNA SEE  
         ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY.  

1119
00:42:53,236 --> 00:42:55,269
        DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? 

1120
00:42:55,271 --> 00:42:57,238
I TRIED TO GET UP AND LEAVE.    

1121
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,841
HE WOULDN'T LET ME LEAVE.       
THAT'S UNREASONABLE.            

1122
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:02,310
I TOLD HIM I WASN'T             
IN THE MOOD, MA. I TOLD HIM.    

1123
00:43:02,312 --> 00:43:03,477
            THEY DON'T CARE     
            ABOUT YOUR MOODS.   

1124
00:43:03,479 --> 00:43:05,613
EXACTLY.                        
THEY DON'T CARE, MA.            

1125
00:43:05,615 --> 00:43:08,182
THEY DON'T CARE WHAT            
SPACE AND PLACE I'M IN.         

1126
00:43:08,184 --> 00:43:09,917
I KNOW ME.                      
I KNOW HOW TO LEARN.            

1127
00:43:09,919 --> 00:43:11,819
I KNOW WHEN I'M GOOD            
AND WHEN I'M NOT,               
AND I SAID IT.                  

1128
00:43:11,821 --> 00:43:13,187
"I'M NOT GOOD."                 
I SAID THAT.                    

1129
00:43:13,189 --> 00:43:14,989
    THEN YOU ASK FOR            
    PERMISSION TO BE EXCUSED.   

1130
00:43:14,991 --> 00:43:18,659
        YOU SAY, "HEY! MM.      
        I NEED TO SPEAK TO MY   
        COUNSELOR IMMEDIATELY." 

1131
00:43:18,661 --> 00:43:21,896
     YOU DON'T WALK OUT IN      
    THE MIDDLE OF A LESSON      

1132
00:43:21,898 --> 00:43:25,333
    LIKE YOU SOME KING OR GOD   
    THAT NO ONE CAN TAME.       

1133
00:43:25,335 --> 00:43:26,734
TAME?                           

1134
00:43:28,538 --> 00:43:30,171
         DAMN IT, OMARI.        

1135
00:43:30,173 --> 00:43:31,539
                TAME?           

1136
00:43:31,541 --> 00:43:32,840
DON'T DO THAT.                  
DON'T--DON'T...                 

1137
00:43:32,842 --> 00:43:36,077
TWIST AND REMODEL THE CONVO     
AND CHANGE MY MEANING.          

1138
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:39,080
   I'M NOT CHANGING ANYTHING.   
   I'M REPEATING VERBATIM.      

1139
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:45,920
SO WHY ARE YOU HERE?            

1140
00:43:45,922 --> 00:43:48,623
                    HUH?        

1141
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:50,491
WHAT'D YOU COME BACK            
HERE FOR?                       

1142
00:43:50,493 --> 00:43:52,059
     HAD NOWHERE ELSE TO GO?    

1143
00:43:52,061 --> 00:43:53,561
I JUST...                       

1144
00:43:56,032 --> 00:43:57,965
AIN'T WANT TO LEAVE             
THAT WAY.                       

1145
00:44:00,903 --> 00:44:02,603
         SO WHAT'S THIS?        

1146
00:44:04,107 --> 00:44:05,840
       THIS OUR GOOD-BYE?       
       YOU COME TO TELL ME

UM, I'M NOT SURE.               

1276
00:51:37,025 --> 00:51:38,492

HE'S BEEN SUSPENDED.

THEY'RE GOING TO DELIBERATE,    
DECIDE WHETHER TO EXPEL HIM,    

1289
00:52:00,315 --> 00:52:02,983
AND PRESS CHARGES.

         HE TRIED TO RUN AWAY.

LIKE ACCUSATION.                

1333

1336

I'M TALKING ABOUT HIM.          
I'M SAYING HE'S THE SON,        
YOU'RE HIS MOTHER.              

1343
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:29,803

      YEAH, RIGHT, OK,          
      BUT YOU SAID HE'S         
      MY SON, NOT THE SON.

00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,873
I MEANT "THE SON."              

1346
00:53:33,875 --> 00:53:35,208
                OH, OK.         

1347
00:53:40,916 --> 00:53:42,082
    I'M THINKING...             

1348
00:53:43,685 --> 00:53:46,419
    I'M THINKING HE NEEDS       
    A CHANGE, A BIG ONE.        

1349
00:53:46,421 --> 00:53:47,620
                YEAH.           

1350
00:53:47,622 --> 00:53:49,556

STAY WITH ME.                   

1351
00:53:49,558 --> 00:53:51,324
            YOU AND SHEILA?     

1352
00:53:51,326 --> 00:53:52,625
 SHEILA STILL HAS HER PLACE.    
THAT'S NOT WHAT'S IMPORTANT.    

1353
00:53:52,627 --> 00:53:54,361
            YEAH, I DON'T KNOW  
            ABOUT THAT.         

1354
00:53:54,363 --> 00:53:56,396
MAYBE THEY WON'T                
PRESS CHARGES IF WE--           

1355
00:53:56,398 --> 00:53:58,531
IF WE TELL THEM WE'RE

1361
00:54:06,074 --> 00:54:07,674
        AND I'VE BEEN DOING SO  
        FOR OVER A DECADE.      

1362
00:54:07,676 --> 00:54:09,776
NOT HERE.                       
           THERE ARE SOME       
           GOOD TEACHERS HERE.  

1363
00:54:09,778 --> 00:54:11,678
THE SCHOOL IS FAILING, NYA.     
          WAS FAILING.          

1364
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,680
        NOT ANYMORE.            
        THEY DIVIDED US INTO    
        4 DIFFERENT SECTIONS.   

1365
00:54:13,682 --> 00:54:14,814
        WE'RE DOING MUCH BETTER.

1366
00:54:14,816 --> 00:54:16,316
        AND THAT'S ABOUT        
        STUDENT ACCOUNTABILITY  

1367
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:17,650
        AND THE SCHOOL BOARD.   

1368
00:54:17,652 --> 00:54:19,018
         THAT'S NOT             
         THE STAFF HERE.        

1369
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:21,254
      NOT ALL OF US. LOOK.      

1370
00:54:21,256 --> 00:54:23,256
       THERE ARE SOME GOOD      
       TEACHERS HERE.           

1371
00:54:23,258 --> 00:54:24,824
        HE KNOWS THEM.          

1372
00:54:24,826 --> 00:54:26,426
        HE'LL BE COMFORTABLE.   

1373
00:54:26,428 --> 00:54:28,294
       HE'LL BE HERE            
       AND UNDER MY WATCH.      

1374
00:54:28,296 --> 00:54:30,463
OH, YOU CAN'T WATCH HIM         
ALL DAY.                        

1375
00:54:30,465 --> 00:54:31,731
        WELL, NEITHER CAN YOU.  

1376
00:54:31,733 --> 00:54:34,434
BUT I CAN GIVE HIM              
A BETTER SURROUNDING.           

1377
00:54:34,436 --> 00:54:35,602
                BETTER?         

1378
00:54:35,604 --> 00:54:37,370
DON'T DO THAT.                  

1379
00:54:37,372 --> 00:54:39,606
I'M NOT MAKING JUDGMENTS.       
LET'S NOT MAKE IT ABOUT THAT.   

1380
00:54:39,608 --> 00:54:40,774
LET'S KEEP IT ABOUT O.          
               IT IS ABOUT O.   

1381
00:54:40,776 --> 00:54:42,342
NOW, YOU DO WHAT YOU CAN.       
I KNOW THAT.                    

1382
00:54:42,344 --> 00:54:44,177
I'M NOT SUGGESTING YOU'VE       
DONE ANYTHING WRONG.            

1383
00:54:44,179 --> 00:54:47,046
BUT YOU RESIST, YOU             
AND HIM, THE OFFERS I MAKE.     

1384
00:54:47,048 --> 00:54:48,815
NOW I'M NOT--                   
YOU COULD BE PROUD.             

1385
00:54:48,817 --> 00:54:51,251
YOU COULD RIDE OR DIE           
FOR THIS NEIGHBORHOOD           
ALL YOU WANT.                   

1386
00:54:51,253 --> 00:54:53,086
THAT'S GOOD FOR YOU,            
BUT THAT'S NOT GOOD             
FOR OUR SON.                    

1387
00:54:53,088 --> 00:54:54,554
        AND YOU KNOW--          
        YOU KNOW WHAT'S BEST?   

1388
00:54:54,556 --> 00:54:56,656
            SENDING HIM AWAY    
            TO FERNBROOK        

1389
00:54:56,658 --> 00:54:58,358
           DIDN'T STOP          
           THE RAGE.            

1390
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:01,094
       YOU CAN'T SOLVE HIM      
      FROM THE OUTSIDE IN.      

1391
00:55:01,096 --> 00:55:02,495
       DON'T YOU SEE THAT?      

1392
00:55:02,497 --> 00:55:04,731
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN,            
OUTSIDE IN?                     

1393
00:55:04,733 --> 00:55:06,599
I'M WORKING WITH                
THE PARTS I GET, NYA.           

1394
00:55:06,601 --> 00:55:08,434
THAT'S ALL I GET                
ACCESS TO.                      

1395
00:55:08,436 --> 00:55:10,403
HE DOESN'T LET ME IN.           
THAT DOESN'T MEAN I'M           
NOT STILL ACTIVE.               

1396
00:55:10,405 --> 00:55:12,238
I WORK FROM WHATEVER            
WAY HE DICTATES.                

1397
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,474
HE ALWAYS DICTATES,             
BUT HE'S THE SON.               
                   OUR SON.     

1398
00:55:14,476 --> 00:55:15,909
AND HE CAN'T ALWAYS             
BE THE DICTATOR.                

1399
00:55:15,911 --> 00:55:17,610
IT CAN'T ALWAYS BE              
A DEMOCRACY.                    

1400
00:55:17,612 --> 00:55:19,279
SOMETIMES--                     
AND I TRY, BUT YOU,             

1401
00:55:19,281 --> 00:55:20,713
IT'S LIKE WE'RE                 
RUNNING TWO DIFFERENT           
GOVERNMENTS.                    

1402
00:55:20,715 --> 00:55:22,382
        I THOUGHT IT WAS        
        CO-PARENTING.           

1403
00:55:22,384 --> 00:55:23,616
SOMETIMES IT'S--                
AND I'M NOT SAYING              
YOU DON'T DO--                  

1404
00:55:23,618 --> 00:55:24,984
YOU'RE NOT RUNNING              
YOUR PART,                      

1405
00:55:24,986 --> 00:55:26,820
BUT I'M THE MAN, NOT YOU,       
AND HE NEEDS A FIRMER HAND.     

1406
00:55:26,822 --> 00:55:28,087
        THAT ISN'T BLAME?       

1407
00:55:28,089 --> 00:55:29,489
MAYBE NOT ALWAYS HAVE           
A CHOICE IN THE MATTER.         

1408
00:55:29,491 --> 00:55:31,257
    MAYBE HE HAS                
    TOO MANY DAMN CHOICES       

1409
00:55:31,259 --> 00:55:32,792
    AND DOESN'T KNOW HOW        
     TO FOLLOW A LEADER.        

1410
00:55:32,794 --> 00:55:34,727
    HE THINKS IT'S HIM,         
    BUT WHERE IS HE GOING?      

1411
00:55:34,729 --> 00:55:37,297
AND YOU DON'T THINK             
A FIRMER HAND WON'T             
MAKE HIM SUFFOCATE?             

1412
00:55:37,299 --> 00:55:40,099
 YOU THINK I'M TOO LOOSE, SO    
HE'S SLIPPING DOWN THE PIPE?    

1413
00:55:40,101 --> 00:55:41,868
WELL, WHICH GRIP IS BEST?       

1414
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:44,337
PLEASE SHOW ME.                 
PLEASE SHOW ME.                 

1415
00:55:44,339 --> 00:55:45,705
            YOU ALWAYS DO THIS. 

1416
00:55:45,707 --> 00:55:47,006
DO WHAT?                        
           MAKE THIS PERSONAL,  

1417
00:55:47,008 --> 00:55:48,474
        MAKE PARENTING OUR SON  

1418
00:55:48,476 --> 00:55:49,842
        A PERSONAL BATTLE       
       BETWEEN YOU AND I.       

1419
00:55:49,844 --> 00:55:52,312
IT IS BETWEEN YOU AND I.        
WE MADE HIM.                    

1420
00:55:52,314 --> 00:55:54,280
       IT'S NOT YOU AND I.      
       IT'S YOU AND HIM,        

1421
00:55:54,282 --> 00:55:56,182
           ME AND HIM,          
           US AND HIM.          

1422
00:55:56,184 --> 00:55:57,650
            THAT'S THE DEAL.    

1423
00:55:57,652 --> 00:56:00,920
        YOU AND I WITHOUT HIM   
        DOESN'T EXIST.          

1424
00:56:00,922 --> 00:56:02,655
OUCH.                           

1425
00:56:02,657 --> 00:56:04,724
               NO.              

1426
00:56:04,726 --> 00:56:06,726
                    NOT OUCH.   

1427
00:56:06,728 --> 00:56:08,228
                YOU DON'T GET   
                TO SAY THAT.    

1428
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:09,495
I DON'T GET TO BE HURT?         
I CAN'T FEEL PAIN?              

1429
00:56:09,497 --> 00:56:12,098
            NO. YOU DON'T       
            GET TO DO THAT.     

1430
00:56:14,035 --> 00:56:15,969
    OK.                         

1431
00:56:15,971 --> 00:56:18,805
THAT'S FAIR.                    

1432
00:56:18,807 --> 00:56:20,406
IT WAS PARTLY MY FAULT.         

1433
00:56:20,408 --> 00:56:21,941
                I'M NOT LOOKING 
                BACKWARDS.      

1434
00:56:21,943 --> 00:56:23,309
I DIDN'T ASK YOU TO.            

1435
00:56:23,311 --> 00:56:25,411
            YOU BROKE THIS.     
            NOT ME. YOU.        

1436
00:56:25,413 --> 00:56:27,413
 I'M MOVING ON, AND THAT DOESN'T
      MAKE ME A BAD FATHER.     

1437
00:56:27,415 --> 00:56:28,748
            I DIDN'T SAY IT DID.

1438
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:30,083
YOU ALSO DIDN'T TELL OUR SON    
WHO THE REAL VILLAIN IS,        

1439
00:56:30,085 --> 00:56:31,217
AND HE THINKS IT'S ME.          

1440
00:56:31,219 --> 00:56:32,485
        I NEVER LET HIM THINK   
        YOU'RE THE ENEMY.       

1441
00:56:32,487 --> 00:56:34,053
WELL, HE THINKS IT ANYWAY.      

1442
00:56:34,055 --> 00:56:35,822
AND NOW HE WON'T HARDLY         
LISTEN TO ME,                   

1443
00:56:35,824 --> 00:56:37,056
WON'T RESPECT ME ANYMORE.       

1444
00:56:37,058 --> 00:56:39,492
            THAT'S NOT ON ME.   

1445
00:56:39,494 --> 00:56:41,494
            I NEVER--I NEVER    
            BAD TALK YOU.       

1446
00:56:41,496 --> 00:56:43,630
            YOU UPSET WITH ME   
            BECAUSE I...        

1447
00:56:48,737 --> 00:56:51,504
                THAT'S FINE.    
                THAT'S FAIR.    

1448
00:56:51,506 --> 00:56:54,307
       BUT YOU AND HIM AND      
       WHATEVER IS BROKEN,      

1449
00:56:54,309 --> 00:56:56,075
            THAT'S NOT ME.      

1450
00:56:57,879 --> 00:57:00,446
THEN LET HIM COME.              

1451
00:57:00,448 --> 00:57:03,583
LET HIM LIVE WITH ME.           
GIVE ME THAT AUTHORITY.         

1452
00:57:03,585 --> 00:57:05,051
            I HAVEN'T ANY       
            TO GIVE YOU.        

1453
00:57:05,053 --> 00:57:06,853
        YOU THINK FORCING HIM   
        IS GONNA SAVE HIM?      

1454
00:57:06,855 --> 00:57:08,321
                DO IT.          

1455
00:57:08,323 --> 00:57:11,891
            YOU WANT TO         
            DICTATE, TRY IT.    

1456
00:57:11,893 --> 00:57:14,027
        YOU'LL HAVE A GREAT     
        REBELLION ON YOUR HANDS.

1457
00:57:14,029 --> 00:57:15,561
I CAN DEAL WITH REBELLION.      

1458
00:57:15,563 --> 00:57:17,063
IT'S YOU. YOU'RE                
THE BARRICADE.                  

1459
00:57:17,065 --> 00:57:19,399
WHEN YOU RESIST,                
HE CAN SNIFF IT.                

1460
00:57:21,436 --> 00:57:23,936
THEN I BECOME THE ENEMY.        

1461
00:57:29,611 --> 00:57:32,145
            I WON'T RESIST.     

1462
00:57:32,147 --> 00:57:34,480
I'LL CALL THE SCHOOL            
ON MONDAY, FIRST THING.         

1463
00:57:34,482 --> 00:57:36,115
THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO.            

1464
00:57:36,117 --> 00:57:37,850
PULL HIM OUT OF SCHOOL          
     AND ASK THEM

00:58:06,181 --> 00:58:09,148
            HE'LL HATE US BOTH.

1549
01:00:56,851 --> 01:00:58,150
            BANGING HIS HEAD    
             INTO THE FLOOR.    

1550
01:00:58,152 --> 01:00:59,585

01:01:04,358 --> 01:01:06,158
WE WERE ON THE PHONE            
WITH BEKIM.                     

1555
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:08,194
HE WAS COMPLAINING              
ABOUT A KID WHO WAS             
 HIGH IN HIS ROOM.              

1556

TILL WE GET THERE.              

1559
01:01:13,701 --> 01:01:15,101
                    THAT DOESN'T
                    ALWAYS WORK.

1560
01:01:15,103 --> 01:01:17,236
   OF COURSE IT DOESN'T WORK.   
          IT'S STUPID.          

1561
01:01:17,238 --> 01:01:19,638
 I HAVE A CLASSROOM FULL OF KIDS
     TO PROTECT AND MYSELF.     

1562

          TO DO?                

1565
01:01:24,112 --> 01:01:27,246
   HE WAS POUNDING HIS HEAD     
   INTO THE FLOOR LIKE THIS...  

1566
01:01:30,551 --> 01:01:34,353
        LIKE HE WAS             
    GOING TO KILL HIM.          

1567
01:01:34,355 --> 01:01:38,657
    HAKEEM'S HEAD WAS SECONDS   
    AWAY FROM SPLITTING OPEN.   

1568
01:01:38,659 --> 01:01:41,126
   DeSHAWN WAS SEEING RED.      
   I SCREAMED TO HIM TO STOP.   

1569
01:01:41,128 --> 01:01:42,595
        DO YOU THINK            
        HE COULD HEAR ME?       

1570
01:01:42,597 --> 01:01:44,730
   HE COULDN'T HEAR THE VOICE   
   OF GOD IN THAT MOMENT.       

1571
01:01:44,732 --> 01:01:46,131
DUN: I'M JUST SAYING            
WHAT THE PROTOCOL IS.           

1572
01:01:46,133 --> 01:01:47,700
I'M NOT SAYING                  
YOU WERE WRONG.                 

1573
01:01:47,702 --> 01:01:50,870
    ... RIGHT, AND ... WRONG!   
    THERE'S ONLY NECESSARY.     

1574
01:01:50,872 --> 01:01:52,304
                    WHAT DID    
                    COLDEN SAY? 

1575
01:01:52,306 --> 01:01:54,507
    OH, HE'S TALKING TO THE     
    PARENTS, THE SUPERINTENDENT.

1576
01:01:54,509 --> 01:01:56,375
     NOW, ALL OF A SUDDEN,      
EVERYBODY WHO DOESN'T KNOW ...  

1577
01:01:56,377 --> 01:01:58,177
     ABOUT WHAT IT'S LIKE       
     TO TEACH IN A CLASSROOM    

1578
01:01:58,179 --> 01:01:59,745
    IS GONNA BE MY JUDGE        
          AND JURY.             

1579
01:01:59,747 --> 01:02:01,814
                DO YOU WANT ME  
                TO DO ANYTHING? 

1580
01:02:01,816 --> 01:02:03,682
             YOU WANT ME TO TALK
            TO DeSHAWN'S MOTHER?

1581
01:02:03,684 --> 01:02:05,050
    OH, SHE'S THE LEAST         
    OF MY WORRIES.              

1582
01:02:05,052 --> 01:02:06,585
    ... KIDS AND THEIR          
    CAMERA PHONES,              

1583
01:02:06,587 --> 01:02:08,487
   IS EVERYTHING A GODDAMN      
   YouTube SENSATION TO THEM?   

1584
01:02:08,489 --> 01:02:10,289
                    THEY DIDN'T.

1585
01:02:10,291 --> 01:02:11,924
   AND HOW THE HELL             
   DID THEY GET PAST SECURITY   
   WITH THOSE PHONES?           

1586
01:02:11,926 --> 01:02:13,058
         PLEASE TELL ME.        

1587
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:14,159
BACK TO ME AGAIN?               

1588
01:02:14,161 --> 01:02:15,694
    IT'S A SIMPLE               
    ... QUESTION.               

1589
01:02:15,696 --> 01:02:17,596
WELL, SOME STUFF GETS PAST.     
IT AIN'T THE AIRPORT.           

1590
01:02:17,598 --> 01:02:19,565
    COULD'VE FOOLED ME.         

1591
01:02:19,567 --> 01:02:21,967
   WHAT'S A METAL DETECTOR      
   FOR IF IT DOESN'T, YOU       
   KNOW, CATCH ALL THE METAL?   

1592
01:02:21,969 --> 01:02:24,637
    DUN: WELL, CELL PHONES      
    AIN'T THE METAL WE'RE       
    MOST INTERESTED IN.         

1593
01:02:24,639 --> 01:02:26,005
WHAT CAN I SAY?                 

1594
01:02:26,007 --> 01:02:27,573
                DON'T SAY ... TO
                ME EVER AGAIN!  

1595
01:02:27,575 --> 01:02:29,208
           LAURIE!              
YOU KEEP                        
THINKING THIS IS ME.            

1596
01:02:29,210 --> 01:02:30,643
YOU ACT LIKE I DID              
SOMETHING WRONG.                

1597
01:02:30,645 --> 01:02:32,077
WHAT'D I DO WRONG?              

1598

DID I NOT REACH YOU             
FAST ENOUGH?                    

1602
01:02:38,986 --> 01:02:41,220
DID I NOT RUN                   
FROM ONE HALLWAY                
TO ANOTHER

I'M SO SORRY.                   

1605

        IT'S NOT JUST LAURIE.   

1631

            ALL THE TIME,       

1632
01:03:53,994 --> 01:03:56,562
   AND I'VE TRIED EVERYTHING--  
   TALKING TO THEIR PARENTS,    

1633
01:03:56,564 --> 01:03:58,263
   SPLITTING THEM UP ON         
   OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE ROOM.  

1634
01:03:58,265 --> 01:04:00,566
            I'VE EVEN TRIED     
            TO STOP IT MYSELF.  

1635
01:04:00,568 --> 01:04:02,901
                WE'VE ALL TRIED.

1636
01:04:02,903 --> 01:04:05,471
YOU CAN'T STOP IT.              
           DON'T TELL ME THAT.  

1637
01:04:05,473 --> 01:04:09,508
HOW YOU GONNA STOP IT IF        
YOU DON'T KNOW THE SOURCE?      

1638
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:11,510
   SUPPOSED TO KNOW             
   A MILLION AND ONE SOURCES?   

1639
01:04:11,512 --> 01:04:13,746
YOU GOT TO KNOW WHAT            
 THEY CARRY IN THEM.            

1640
01:04:13,748 --> 01:04:15,514
THE RESENTMENT                  
 AND THE RAGE,                  

1641
01:04:15,516 --> 01:04:17,015
THERE'S A LEGACY                
IN THAT.                        

1642
01:04:17,017 --> 01:04:18,984
SOURCE OF THOSE FIGHTS          
IS OLDER THAN THE BRICKS        

1643
01:04:18,986 --> 01:04:21,687
OF THIS BUILDING,               
BUT NOBODY'S                    
DOING THEIR RESEARCH.           

1644
01:04:21,689 --> 01:04:24,022
YOU GOT A BUNCH OF PARENTS,     
TEACHERS, POLITICIANS,          

1645
01:04:24,024 --> 01:04:26,525
WHOEVER TRYING TO               
UNDERSTAND THESE KIDS.          

1646
01:04:26,527 --> 01:04:28,427
HOW YOU GONNA UNDERSTAND        
A BOOK YOU'RE ONLY SKIMMING?    

1647
01:04:28,429 --> 01:04:30,329
    NYA: HAVE TO UNDERSTAND.    
    MY SON'S LIFE DEPENDS ON IT.

1648
01:04:30,331 --> 01:04:31,697
    I TRIED EVERYTHING.         

1649
01:04:31,699 --> 01:04:33,098
            YOU'RE DOING WHAT   
            YOU CAN, NYA.

            IN A GOOD SCHOOL.   

1651
01:04:34,468 --> 01:04:35,501
   DOESN'T MATTER               
   WHERE I SEND HIM TO SCHOOL.  

1652
01:04:35,503 --> 01:04:37,402
    NOTHING IS WORKING.         

1653
01:04:37,404 --> 01:04:41,206
        HE'S BEING SUCKED

1654
01:04:41,208 --> 01:04:44,743
   TRYING TO HOLD ON TO HIM,    
   BUT THE FORCE IS SO STRONG,

                     NEVER MIND.
                    LET THIS GO.

1771
01:10:16,343 --> 01:10:18,376
AND YOU WERE                    
 MEAN, COLD,                    

1772
01:10:18,378 --> 01:10:22,547
MAKING HER FEEL                 
LIKE ... EVERY DAY.             

1773
01:10:22,549 --> 01:10:24,549
YOU WAS NEVER HAPPY             
LIVING AROUND HERE.             

1774
01:10:24,551 --> 01:10:27,252
THAT WASN'T HER FAULT,          
MINE, NEITHER.                  

1775
01:10:27,254 --> 01:10:30,221
        I TOOK GOOD CARE OF YOU,

1776
01:10:30,223 --> 01:10:33,324

1777
01:10:33,326 --> 01:10:35,427
        OR FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL. 

1778
01:10:35,429 --> 01:10:36,995
        YOU NEVER WENT HUNGRY,  
        ALWAYS HAD A SHIRT ON   
        YOUR BACK,              

1779
01:10:36,997 --> 01:10:38,563
        MONEY IN YOUR POCKET.   

1780
01:10:38,565 --> 01:10:39,964
            DIDN'T I DO THAT?   
            IS THAT MY SIN?     

1781
01:10:39,966 --> 01:10:41,499
YOU KNOW, MOST                  
OF THESE DUDES                  

1782
01:10:41,501 --> 01:10:44,569
WANT THEIR OLD MAN              
IN THEIR LIFE SO BAD,           

1783
01:10:44,571 --> 01:10:46,037
 THEY THINK IT'S                
THE MISSING LINK                

1784
01:10:46,039 --> 01:10:47,739
TO THE EQUATION,                
A LAST INGREDIENT               

1785
01:10:47,741 --> 01:10:49,607
TO UNDERSTANDING                
THEIR MANHOOD,                  

1786
01:10:49,609 --> 01:10:51,843
BUT WHAT'S                      
HAVING YOU IN FLESH?            

1787
01:10:51,845 --> 01:10:53,411
FLESH AIN'T ...                 

1788
01:10:53,413 --> 01:10:54,979
IT AIN'T NO DIFFERENT           
THAN SPERM.                     

1789
01:10:54,981 --> 01:10:56,314
IT'S CLINICAL.                  
IT DOES THE BIOLOGY.            

1790
01:10:56,316 --> 01:10:57,482
IT DON'T DO                     
THE SOUL.                       

1791
01:10:57,484 --> 01:10:58,883
                THE HELL YOU    
                WANT ME TO DO?  

1792
01:10:58,885 --> 01:11:00,251
        YOU WANT ME TO CRY      
        AND ROCK YOU IN MY ARMS 

1793
01:11:00,253 --> 01:11:01,920
        TILL YOU FALL ASLEEP?   

1794
01:11:01,922 --> 01:11:03,688
        THAT'S NOT MY GIG.      
        I'M STILL YOUR FATHER.  
        I'M STILL HERE.

1797
01:11:06,827 --> 01:11:08,726

            IF YOU LIKE ME      

1798
01:11:08,728 --> 01:11:10,862
        OR YOU WANT TO GO TO THE
        GODDAMN BASKETBALL COURT

1799
01:11:10,864 --> 01:11:13,331
         WITH ME OR YOU         
        WANT TO PIN A ...       
         TAIL ON MY ASS.

01:11:13,333 --> 01:11:14,699
                I'M HERE.       

1801
01:11:14,701 --> 01:11:15,967
            I'M THE FATHER,     
            AND YOU'RE THE KID, 

1802
01:11:15,969 --> 01:11:17,235
            AND THAT'S THE LAW  
            OF THE LAND.        

1803
01:11:17,237 --> 01:11:19,270
            LIKE IT OR HATE IT--
             SCREW IT--I'M HERE.

1804
01:11:19,272 --> 01:11:20,905
YOU AIN'T HERE.                 

1805
01:11:22,976 --> 01:11:24,776

1806
01:11:24,778 --> 01:11:28,413
I'M HERE.                       
WE MILES APART.                 

1807
01:11:30,650 --> 01:11:32,684
        YOU'RE GONNA RESPECT ME.

1808
01:11:32,686 --> 01:11:35,053
        DON'T HAVE TO LIKE ME,  

1809
01:11:35,055 --> 01:11:38,223
            DON'T HAVE TO       
            ENJOY MY COMPANY,   

1810
01:11:38,225 --> 01:11:40,592
            BUT THE RESPECT     
            IS NON-NEGOTIABLE.  

1811
01:11:40,594 --> 01:11:41,926
OR WHAT?                        

1812
01:11:41,928 --> 01:11:42,927
                YOU REALLY WANT 
                TO ASK ME THAT? 

1813
01:11:42,929 --> 01:11:44,429
I WANT TO KNOW                  
WHAT IF I SAY NO.               

1814

SOMETIMES

LISTENING TO THE LESSON...      

1819
01:12:39,819 --> 01:12:42,120
WAS GONNA BE                    
A SILENT OBSERVER,              

1820

BUT YOU DIDN'T ANSWER,          

1829
01:13:05,245 --> 01:13:08,479
SO I WENT TO CLASS,

"DO NOT ... CALL ON ME.         
I DO NOT HAVE THE ANSWER,"      

1873
01:15:17,677 --> 01:15:21,212

PUSHING ME AND PUSHING ME,      

1874
01:15:21,214 --> 01:15:23,347
AND I STAND UP TO WALK OUT      
BECAUSE I FEEL THE ROOM

BECOMING BIGGER THOMAS,

01:15:26,019 --> 01:15:28,352
EVEN WHEN I HATE                
THIS PART OF THE STORY,         

1877
01:15:28,354 --> 01:15:31,889
AND TEACHER GET IN MY WAY,      
TELLS ME TO SIT DOWN,           

1878
01:15:31,891 --> 01:15:35,526
GRABS ME LIKE YOU               
GRABBED MY ARM                  

1879
01:15:35,528 --> 01:15:38,562
WHEN YOU TRY TO PLAY            
DADDY ALL OF A SUDDEN,          

1880
01:15:38,564 --> 01:15:40,531
AND I PUSHED THAT BITCH,        
 THREW HIS ASS OFF OF ME        

1881
01:15:40,533 --> 01:15:42,366
AND INTO THE ...                
SMARTBOARD,                     

1882
01:15:42,368 --> 01:15:45,236
THREW HIM LIKE HE WAS           
A MONKEY HANGING ON MY BACK,    

1883
01:15:45,238 --> 01:15:47,805
LIKE HE WAS YOU,

IT WAS YOU.                     

1885
01:15:49,942 --> 01:15:51,709
I'M WISHING I COULD             
THROW HIM AGAIN,                

1886
01:15:51,711 --> 01:15:53,544
POUND HIS ... FACE              
INTO THE GROUND,                

1887
01:15:53,546 --> 01:15:55,246
RIP THAT CHECK UP,

IT WASN'T YOU I PUSHED--        
IT WAS MY TEACHER--

NO, I WISHED IT WAS YOU         
SO BAD, I HAD TO PEE.           

1892
01:16:03,523 --> 01:16:05,523

IS HATE OR LOVE

KILLS ME IN A THOUSAND WAYS,

    ENOUGH CHANCES TO ... UP

        I HATE THAT.

          WE DID HAVE,          

1930
01:18:37,743 --> 01:18:40,177
   FOR THE PARTS THAT MADE ME   
   WANT TO CUT A CHICK'S FACE   

1931

    FOR YOU TURNING YOUR HEAD   
        IN HER DIRECTION,

    FOR GIVING ME THAT SPACE,   

1933
01:18:49,388 --> 01:18:52,756

         TO BE JEALOUS

    FOR LEAVING ME HERE         

1939
01:19:08,874 --> 01:19:11,241
    AND BREAKING IT OFF         
    AND NOT KNOWING YOURSELF.

  that counts, not yesterday.   

3789
02:34:03,928 --> 02:34:06,028
     All we need to do          
     is follow Eric's lead.     

3790
02:34:06,097 --> 02:34:08,631
  He's in the stroke position,  
  he's setting the rhythm.

       a real chance.

   -All right. Move the boat.   

3795
02:34:16,107 --> 02:34:18,040

        What's happened?        
        Is it your hand?        

3800

          -My finger.

3801
02:34:25,783 --> 02:34:27,383

    as you think.

   see if he can fix it.        

3803

  Ellie, you'll need to cover   
  for me at the fish stall.

  do this in the first place.

      And now I've got          
      to work at the stall      

3807
02:34:38,630 --> 02:34:41,464
    and wear that stupid hat    
    and stink of fish?          

3808
02:34:41,532 --> 02:34:43,065
(Eric)                          
I'm in a lot of pain right now. 

3809
02:34:43,134 --> 02:34:46,502
    So, please,                 
    open up the fish stall.     

3810

  (Joe)                         
  What's wrong with your leg?   

3812
02:34:55,380 --> 02:34:59,248
Not that there's anything wrong 
with your legs.                 

3813
02:34:59,317 --> 02:35:01,217
  (Alice)                       
  It's an old training injury.  

3814
02:35:01,286 --> 02:35:04,253
It's what they call dedication.

3821
02:35:14,132 --> 02:35:14,864
      stop messing around

3822
02:35:14,932 --> 02:35:16,198
  and go and open the surgery.

02:35:16,267 --> 02:35:18,801
       (Morwenna)               
       Well, I need to go       
       get changed.

02:35:18,870 --> 02:35:20,336
  (Joe)                         
  Doc, a minute of your time.   

3825
02:35:20,405 --> 02:35:21,570
     This is Dr. Ellingham.     

3826
02:35:21,639 --> 02:35:23,472
       He'll have a look        
       at your legs--leg.       

3827
02:35:23,541 --> 02:35:26,042
  (Alice)                       
  Yes, it's actually--          
  it's quite painful now, so--  

3828
02:35:26,110 --> 02:35:28,044
  (Martin)                      
  If you want a consultation,   
  make an appointment.          

3829
02:35:28,112 --> 02:35:29,478
      Well, you could just      
      tell me what it is.       

3830
02:35:29,547 --> 02:35:31,447
  It's a leg, if you want me    
  to diagnose your condition,   

3831
02:35:31,516 --> 02:35:33,315
    make an appointment         
    and come to the surgery.    

3832
02:35:35,987 --> 02:35:37,420
         "It's a leg"!          

3833
02:35:41,225 --> 02:35:43,426
            (Bert)              
            Al! Al!             

3834
02:35:43,494 --> 02:35:45,161
     A little bit of help.      

3835
02:35:45,229 --> 02:35:47,229
      I'm very busy, Dad.       

3836
02:35:47,298 --> 02:35:49,899
           Al! Al...            

3837
02:35:49,967 --> 02:35:52,835
     -What is it?               
     -I'm in agony up here.     

3838
02:35:52,904 --> 02:35:53,636
            (sighs)             

3839
02:35:53,705 --> 02:35:54,537
             Right.             

3840
02:35:54,605 --> 02:35:55,538
             Okay!              

3841
02:36:02,313 --> 02:36:03,379
             (Bert)             
             Oi.                

3842
02:36:03,448 --> 02:36:05,147
      You took your time.       

3843
02:36:05,216 --> 02:36:06,182
       (Al)                     
       I'm packing cases.       

3844
02:36:06,250 --> 02:36:09,018
       -What's happened?        
       -It's my foot.           

3845

3846
02:36:10,121 --> 02:36:11,720
      You've got to get me      
      up the hill               

3847
02:36:11,789 --> 02:36:13,489

   No, no,                      
   not if it's inconvenient.    

3850
02:36:17,128 --> 02:36:19,295
I'm about to pass out           
'cause of the excruciating pain 

3851
02:36:19,363 --> 02:36:21,464
       that is throbbing        
       through my toe.          

3852
02:36:21,532 --> 02:36:22,898

3853
02:36:22,967 --> 02:36:25,234
    have a bit of breakfast,    
    read the paper.

 Would you take James, please?

  What's wrong with your arm?

    He's got two left feet.

 It's all right,                
 Doc says it's not contagious.

    this morning.               

3886
02:37:42,680 --> 02:37:44,313
   Maybe I should go and see    
   that doctor of yours.        

3887
02:37:44,382 --> 02:37:46,382
   (Joe)                        
   I strongly advise you do.    

3888
02:37:46,450 --> 02:37:48,851
  As umpire,                    
  I have discretion to decide   

3889
02:37:48,920 --> 02:37:51,854
  if people are physically fit  
  for the competition or not.   

3890
02:37:51,923 --> 02:37:54,690
 -Also, that looks terrifying.  
 -Yes, fine,                    

3891
02:37:54,759 --> 02:37:57,059
 I'll go see that               
 Dr. Ellington after practice.  

3892
02:37:57,128 --> 02:37:58,694
          -Ellingham.           
          -What?                

3893
02:37:58,763 --> 02:38:00,763
      It's Dr. Ellingham.       

3894
02:38:00,831 --> 02:38:03,265
            -"Gham."            
            -Right.             

3895
02:38:03,334 --> 02:38:05,000
         (Joe)                  
         It's up there.         

3896
02:38:05,069 --> 02:38:06,969
     Just tell him              
     Joe Penhale sent you.      

3897
02:38:07,038 --> 02:38:08,938
   -He'll know what you mean.   
   -Oh, right.                  

3898
02:38:09,006 --> 02:38:10,706
    So he'll see me quicker     
    if I mention your name?     

3899
02:38:10,775 --> 02:38:13,909
       (Joe)                    
       Probably not, no.        

3900
02:38:13,978 --> 02:38:15,644
 (Alice)                        
 So why did you bring this up?  

3901
02:38:17,581 --> 02:38:19,281
        You were trying         
        to impress me.          

3902
02:38:21,152 --> 02:38:23,686
      -Did it impress you?      
      -No.                      

3903
02:38:27,892 --> 02:38:30,793
     -Think you can fix it?     
     -It's not broken.          

3904
02:38:30,861 --> 02:38:32,294
        It's dislocated.        

3905
02:38:32,363 --> 02:38:33,896
         Look that way.

             (Eric)             
             Argh!              

3907
02:38:35,266 --> 02:38:37,299
 Bit of warning next time, Doc. 

3908
02:38:37,368 --> 02:38:38,534
        -You feel that?         
        -Yeah.                  

3909
02:38:38,602 --> 02:38:42,004
 Good, I'll need to splint that 
 and bandage it.                

3910
02:38:42,073 --> 02:38:43,772
   (Eric)                       
   How long will that be for?   

3911
02:38:43,841 --> 02:38:45,140
      (Martin)                  
      Come back and see me      
      in three days,            

3912
02:38:45,209 --> 02:38:47,176
 but it will need to stay bound 
 for at least two weeks.        

3913
02:38:47,244 --> 02:38:49,211
      (Eric)                    
      No, no, no, Doc,          
      we've got the race.       

3914
02:38:49,280 --> 02:38:51,547
     (Martin)                   
     No, you're not racing.     

3915
02:38:51,615 --> 02:38:52,815
    (Eric)                      
    There's got to be a way.    

3916
02:38:52,883 --> 02:38:54,550
    I've convinced my Ellie     
    to get involved.            

3917
02:38:54,618 --> 02:38:56,385
    Spends most of her time     
    on her bloody phone.        

3918
02:38:56,454 --> 02:38:59,154
 She's gonna be pretty annoyed  
 if she has to row without me.  

3919
02:38:59,223 --> 02:39:03,025
   Can't you just give it       
   an injection or something?   

3920
02:39:03,094 --> 02:39:05,994
   (Martin)                     
   You need to rest your hand   
   to avoid doing further       

3921
02:39:06,063 --> 02:39:08,330
    and more serious damage     
    to yourself.                

3922
02:39:08,399 --> 02:39:11,533
      -This is important.       
      -No, it's not.            

3923
02:39:11,602 --> 02:39:13,202
       It's a boat race.        

3924
02:39:15,539 --> 02:39:17,106
       -So?                     
       -Sorry, Morwenna.        

3925
02:39:17,174 --> 02:39:19,041
  Oh, Doc, wasn't there         
  anything else you could do?   

3926
02:39:19,110 --> 02:39:20,776
       (Martin)                 
       No, there wasn't.

   (Bert)                       
   Doc, can you help me here?   

3928
02:39:24,515 --> 02:39:27,416
       -Yes, go through.        
       -Oh, thanks.             

3929
02:39:27,485 --> 02:39:29,318
   (Eric)                       
   You know if I could race,    
   I would.                     

3930
02:39:29,386 --> 02:39:33,722
(Morwenna)                      
Where am I gonna find somebody  
last minute to take your place? 

3931
02:39:33,791 --> 02:39:35,591
    (Al)                        
    Oh, no, no,                 
    I mean, I wish I could,     

3932
02:39:35,659 --> 02:39:38,260
I really do but I need          
to look after the pub tomorrow, 

3933
02:39:38,329 --> 02:39:39,895
     especially                 
     as Dad's not so well.      

3934
02:39:39,964 --> 02:39:41,296
          Oh, cheers.           

3935
02:39:48,105 --> 02:39:50,239
          -It's gout.           
          -Gout?                

3936
02:39:50,307 --> 02:39:51,907
  But I don't drink port, Doc.  

3937
02:39:51,976 --> 02:39:53,709
    (Martin)                    
    Gout's got nothing to do    
    with port.                  

3938
02:39:53,777 --> 02:39:55,110
        Babies get gout.        

3939
02:39:55,179 --> 02:39:56,912
    There's often               
    a genetic predisposition    

3940
02:39:56,981 --> 02:39:59,081
   towards a high level         
   of uric acid in the blood.   

3941
02:39:59,150 --> 02:40:02,117
 (Bert)                         
 Well, that's very interesting, 
 Doc, but I'm in agony here.    

3942
02:40:02,186 --> 02:40:04,953
   (Martin)                     
   Yes, I'll prescribe you      
   naproxen to dull the pain    

3943
02:40:05,022 --> 02:40:07,122
    and also test your blood    
    to see if you'd benefit     

3944
02:40:07,191 --> 02:40:09,925
  from allopurinol, but that's  
  a long-term solution.         

3945
02:40:09,994 --> 02:40:12,861
  (Bert)                        
  I just need to get back       
  on my feet so I can help Al.  

3946
02:40:12,930 --> 02:40:14,997
   Isn't there some quick fix   
   you can give me?             

3947
02:40:15,065 --> 02:40:17,132
 (Martin)                       
 No, it doesn't work like that. 

3948
02:40:17,201 --> 02:40:18,267
       Keep your foot           
       raised for a week,       

3949
02:40:18,335 --> 02:40:19,434
  put an ice-pack on your toe,  

3950
02:40:19,503 --> 02:40:21,336
   and drink plenty of water.   

3951
02:40:21,405 --> 02:40:22,838
  (Morwenna)                    
  Well, if you can't help me,   

3952
02:40:22,907 --> 02:40:25,140
    can you think               
    of anyone else who can?     

3953
02:40:25,209 --> 02:40:27,709
   (Al)                         
   Well, you used to row,       
   didn't you, Mr. Cleveland?   

3954
02:40:27,778 --> 02:40:29,111
        (Mr. Cleveland)         
        I did, yes.             

3955
02:40:29,180 --> 02:40:31,580
  In fact, I rowed alongside    
  your grandfather, Morwenna.   

3956
02:40:31,649 --> 02:40:33,382
  (Morwenna)                    
  Really? I didn't know that.   

3957
02:40:33,450 --> 02:40:34,950
  (Mr. Cleveland)               
  Before your time, of course.  

3958
02:40:35,019 --> 02:40:36,618
    If you're in a real bind    
    I suppose I could get       

3959
02:40:36,687 --> 02:40:37,553
   into the boat again and--    

3960
02:40:37,621 --> 02:40:39,555
            (coughs)            

3961
02:40:41,058 --> 02:40:42,357
    (Morwenna)                  
    You're all right, Mr. C.    

3962
02:40:42,426 --> 02:40:44,026
  I'm sure we'll find someone.  

3963
02:40:44,094 --> 02:40:46,161
         Thanks though.         

3964
02:40:46,230 --> 02:40:47,996
     Oh. All right, Alice?      

3965
02:40:48,065 --> 02:40:49,898
(Alice)                         
I'd like to make an appointment 
with Dr. Ellington.             

3966
02:40:49,967 --> 02:40:51,333
 (Al)                           
 Oh, it's Ellingham, Ellingham. 

3967
02:40:51,402 --> 02:40:52,634
        (Morwenna)              
        Yeah, Ellingham.        

3968
02:40:52,703 --> 02:40:56,038
I should be able to squeeze you 
in in about an hour.            

3969
02:40:56,106 --> 02:40:58,073
   -Is there nothing earlier?   
   -I'm in no rush.             

3970
02:40:58,142 --> 02:40:59,074
            (coughs)            

3971
02:40:59,143 --> 02:41:01,376
 She can--she can go before me. 

3972
02:41:01,445 --> 02:41:02,744
           (Morwenna)           
           Oh.                  

3973
02:41:02,813 --> 02:41:04,479
   (Alice)                      
   I hear you're a man down.    

3974
02:41:04,548 --> 02:41:05,881
  I do hope you find someone.   

3975
02:41:05,950 --> 02:41:08,250
   Won't be much of a contest   
   otherwise.                   

3976
02:41:08,319 --> 02:41:09,685
           -Mind you.           
           -Yeah,               

3977
02:41:09,753 --> 02:41:11,587
     maybe this year            
     will be different, eh?     

3978
02:41:11,655 --> 02:41:12,955
          Take a seat.          

3979
02:41:13,023 --> 02:41:15,524
            (Alice)

3980
02:41:15,593 --> 02:41:18,193
     -Everything okay, Dad?     
     -I've got gout, boy.       

3981
02:41:18,262 --> 02:41:19,861
   I've got to put my leg up    
   for a week.                  

3982
02:41:19,930 --> 02:41:22,798
     -What about the pub?       
     -I'm the invalid here.     

3983
02:41:22,866 --> 02:41:24,700
         -Next patient?         
         -Alice Taylor.         

3984
02:41:24,768 --> 02:41:25,801
    She's from Port Carran,     

3985
02:41:25,869 --> 02:41:28,103
    but I'll register her       
    as a temporary patient.     

3986
02:41:28,172 --> 02:41:30,072
      -Yes. Come through.       
      -Thanks.                  

3987
02:41:30,140 --> 02:41:31,173
        -Morning, Bert.         
        -Hello, Janet.          

3988
02:41:31,241 --> 02:41:32,975
      -What, a whole week?      
      -Well, I could try        

3989
02:41:33,043 --> 02:41:34,409
      and get up for lunch      
      and dinner,               

3990
02:41:34,478 --> 02:41:37,446

I've got something to tell you.

02:42:04,008 --> 02:42:06,575
     I've decided

4002
02:42:06,643 --> 02:42:08,877

4004
02:42:12,616 --> 02:42:15,717
       and it's harder

4005
02:42:15,786 --> 02:42:18,353
     And I'll miss the kids

4015

 It's been hurting for a while. 

4017
02:42:46,950 --> 02:42:49,184
    My GP had a look,           
    but it's just blown up.

 They can come up very quickly. 

4020

  -Well, it sounds manageable.  
  -No.                          

4021
02:42:53,624 --> 02:42:54,956
   It needs to be dealt with.   

4022
02:42:55,025 --> 02:42:56,958
  If it bursts, which it looks  
  like it could at any moment,  

4023
02:42:57,027 --> 02:42:58,260
      and the fluid leaks       
      into your calf,           

4024
02:42:58,328 --> 02:43:00,796
     then the pain              
     will be excruciating.

02:43:02,699 --> 02:43:03,732
  (Martin)                      
  Yes, I'll draw out the fluid  

4027
02:43:03,801 --> 02:43:05,000
       and put a dressing       
       on it for you.

02:43:05,068 --> 02:43:06,835
    (Alice)

02:43:06,904 --> 02:43:09,004
(Martin)                        
No, I'll insert a needle        
and draw it out with a syringe. 

4030
02:43:09,072 --> 02:43:12,707
    (Alice)

with needles as a child.        

4033
02:43:15,913 --> 02:43:16,978
        I had jaundice.         

4034
02:43:17,047 --> 02:43:17,846
   A lot of blood was taken.    

4035
02:43:17,915 --> 02:43:20,015
      It was very painful.

     (Martin)

     that's understandable.

02:43:21,785 --> 02:43:23,518

No, if you stick a needle in me,

4038
02:43:23,587 --> 02:43:26,822

02:47:41,611 --> 02:47:42,644
           (Al)                 
           Any luck?            

4153
02:47:42,712 --> 02:47:43,678
              No.               

4154
02:47:43,747 --> 02:47:44,812
       Half the village         
       don't want to row        

4155
02:47:44,881 --> 02:47:46,281
       'cause they think        
       we're gonna lose,        

4156
02:47:46,349 --> 02:47:49,384
     and the other half are     
     physically incapable.      

4157
02:47:49,452 --> 02:47:50,418
   (Bert)                       
   Put me in the second camp.   

4158
02:47:50,487 --> 02:47:52,787
       I have every faith       
       in your ability.         

4159
02:47:52,856 --> 02:47:54,722
     Chippy said you'd put      
     Port Carran down           

4160
02:47:54,791 --> 02:47:57,058
  as odds-on favorites to win.  

4161
02:47:57,127 --> 02:47:59,327
   (Bert)                       
   I'm in a lot of pain         
   and wish to be left alone.   

4162
02:47:59,396 --> 02:48:00,895
              Now.              

4163
02:48:00,964 --> 02:48:02,830
      (Morwenna)                
      Come on, Al. Please.      

4164
02:48:02,899 --> 02:48:04,065
 (Al)                           
 Oh, last time I got in a boat, 

4165
02:48:04,134 --> 02:48:05,633
    I smashed a woman           
    in the face with the oar    

4166
02:48:05,702 --> 02:48:07,135
    and burst her nose open.    

4167
02:48:07,203 --> 02:48:09,771
      -I remember that.         
      -It was an accident.      

4168
02:48:09,839 --> 02:48:11,839
        Morwenna,               
        I'd love to help        

4169
02:48:11,908 --> 02:48:13,141
 but I've got this place, so... 

4170
02:48:13,209 --> 02:48:15,343
    (Bert)                      
    The pub                     
    is gonna open later now.    

4171
02:48:15,412 --> 02:48:17,345
    I promised Louisa           
    I'd go up to the school     

4172
02:48:17,414 --> 02:48:19,847
     and help sell tickets      
     and programs.              

4173
02:48:19,916 --> 02:48:21,616
(Morwenna)                      
That is very kind of you, Bert. 

4174
02:48:21,685 --> 02:48:24,085
  Doing something for the good  
  of the village.               

4175
02:48:24,154 --> 02:48:25,987
 If only there were more people 
 like you about.                

4176

02:48:27,524 --> 02:48:29,257
  (Al)                          
  If I don't say yes,           
  you're gonna keep asking me   

4178
02:48:29,325 --> 02:48:31,526
  -and asking me, aren't you?   
  -No, no, no.                  

4179
02:48:31,594 --> 02:48:33,428
      If you're too scared      
      to get in a boat,         

4180
02:48:33,496 --> 02:48:35,363
   that's no problem at all.    

4181
02:48:37,567 --> 02:48:38,933
        (Al)                    
        I'm not scared.         

4182
02:48:40,737 --> 02:48:41,803
            I'm not.            

4183
02:48:45,141 --> 02:48:46,407
             Okay.              

4184
02:48:46,476 --> 02:48:47,408
           I'll row.            

4185
02:48:49,446 --> 02:48:51,045
             Yeah.              

4186
02:48:51,114 --> 02:48:52,046
              Hm.               

4187
02:48:56,753 --> 02:48:58,653
              Yes?

   I'd like some paracetamol,   
   please.

           Oh, dear.            

4191
02:49:04,828 --> 02:49:06,327
    What's happened to you?     

4192
02:49:06,396 --> 02:49:07,895
    (Alice)                     
    I passed out                
    in the doctor's surgery.    

4193
02:49:07,964 --> 02:49:09,297
            (Sally)             
            Oh.                 

4194
02:49:09,365 --> 02:49:10,698
  (Alice)                       
  That doctor passed out too.   

4195
02:49:10,767 --> 02:49:12,567
    It was quite the scene.     

4196
02:49:12,635 --> 02:49:13,601
            (Sally)             
            What?               

4197
02:49:13,670 --> 02:49:14,435
        Is he all right?        

4198
02:49:14,504 --> 02:49:16,037
           He's fine.           

4199
02:49:16,106 --> 02:49:17,805
  Something to do with seeing   
  my blood all over the floor.  

4200
02:49:17,874 --> 02:49:20,475
         (Sally)                
         Oh, yes,               
         he's a martyr.         

4201
02:49:20,543 --> 02:49:22,210
          (Alice)               
          Oh, really?           
          In what way?          

4202
02:49:22,278 --> 02:49:24,178
    (Sally)                     
    Oh, it's an affliction,     
    a phobia.                   

4203
02:49:24,247 --> 02:49:26,781
    He's had it                 
    ever since he came here.    

4204
02:49:26,850 --> 02:49:28,049
      Before he came here.      

4205
02:49:28,118 --> 02:49:31,185
    Actually why                
    he had to leave London.     

4206
02:49:31,254 --> 02:49:35,256
   And he fights through it,    
   each and every day.          

4207
02:49:35,325 --> 02:49:36,724

   You can park it anywhere.

02:51:13,189 --> 02:51:16,290
       -Mm. Mostly.             
       -What do you mean?

02:51:16,359 --> 02:51:17,591
(Louisa)                        
I mean I've written the letter. 

4254
02:51:17,660 --> 02:51:22,063
I just haven't officially       
passed it over yet, as it were. 

4255
02:51:22,131 --> 02:51:23,664
 -I don't know what that means. 
 -It means I haven't

       -Why not?

on the road, please?

   -Yes.                        

4260
02:51:34,644 --> 02:51:36,510

 -Yes.                          

4261
02:51:36,579 --> 02:51:38,512

02:51:53,496 --> 02:51:55,429
   You should go and see him.   

4271
02:51:55,498 --> 02:51:57,732

 -Yeah, I like it.

       we're doing well         

4376
02:56:34,043 --> 02:56:35,209
    when actually we're not,    

4377
02:56:35,277 --> 02:56:38,111

    to make things right,       

4378
02:56:38,180 --> 02:56:40,614
        we don't notice.

   (Alice)

       that matters             

4382
02:56:51,594 --> 02:56:53,260
   is that we won last year.    

4383
02:56:53,329 --> 02:56:54,761
      And the year before.      

4384
02:56:54,830 --> 02:56:57,598
        And we will win         
        this year again.        

4385
02:56:57,666 --> 02:56:59,232

    the middle of the night     

4396
02:57:24,727 --> 02:57:25,993

        we came so close        

4410
02:57:59,361 --> 02:58:02,129

   to rob us of that trophy.    

4411
02:58:02,197 --> 02:58:05,032
     But this year,

03:04:27,215 --> 03:04:30,883
    Come on,                    
    put your backs into it!     

4560
03:04:30,952 --> 03:04:32,885
            -Oh!                
            -Oh, Al!            

4561
03:04:32,954 --> 03:04:35,455
      We're losing ground!      
      Come on!                  

4562
03:04:35,523 --> 03:04:38,791
  -Sorry, it was an accident.   
  -Absolutely useless!          

4563
03:04:38,860 --> 03:04:40,193
    (Al)                        
    I told you                  
    I was rubbish at rowing.    

4564
03:04:40,261 --> 03:04:41,828
         (Caitlin)              
         No domestics!          

4565
03:04:41,896 --> 03:04:43,663
       Get back to work!        

4566
03:04:43,732 --> 03:04:48,267
        One, two, three.        

4567
03:04:48,336 --> 03:04:49,535
            Come on!            

4568
03:04:49,604 --> 03:04:55,007
        Four, five, six.        

4569
03:04:55,076 --> 03:04:58,478
        -Round the mark!        
        -Come on.               

4570
03:04:58,546 --> 03:05:00,813
        -Round the mark!        
        -Here they come,        

4571
03:05:00,882 --> 03:05:02,782
        around the buoy!        

4572
03:05:02,851 --> 03:05:04,317
        Portwenn have           
        got it all to do        

4573
03:05:04,385 --> 03:05:06,586
        as Port Carran          
        open up a lead!         

4574
03:05:06,654 --> 03:05:10,223
    The race is definitely      
    in Port Carran's favor.     

4575
03:05:10,291 --> 03:05:12,191
     Not saying we'll need      
     a miracle to catch up,     

4576
03:05:12,260 --> 03:05:16,095
   but I'd start praying now.   

4577
03:05:16,164 --> 03:05:19,565
    Oh, no, here's Portwenn,    
    coming up slowly.           

4578
03:05:19,634 --> 03:05:21,400
  But you know what they say:   

4579
03:05:21,469 --> 03:05:24,770
        "Slowly, slowly,        
        catchy boaty."          

4580
03:05:24,839 --> 03:05:26,239
          (Louisa)              
          Oh, do they?          

4581
03:05:26,307 --> 03:05:27,306
           (chuckles)           

4582
03:05:27,375 --> 03:05:30,109
           Um, hello.           

4583
03:05:30,178 --> 03:05:31,677
      Can you all hear me?      

4584
03:05:31,746 --> 03:05:33,646
    I just wanted to, well,     

4585
03:05:33,715 --> 03:05:35,948
      to thank you all          
      for coming, really,       

4586
03:05:36,017 --> 03:05:37,917
      and to say how much       
      we appreciate             

4587
03:05:37,986 --> 03:05:40,820
    your continued support,     
    year after year.            

4588
03:05:40,889 --> 03:05:42,722
  (Joe)                         
  Uh, Louisa,                   
  this isn't on the schedule.   

4589
03:05:42,790 --> 03:05:45,224
   (Louisa)                     
   Yeah, just a minute, Joe.    

4590
03:05:45,293 --> 03:05:48,094
  I remember when I first saw   
  this race as a child,         

4591
03:05:48,162 --> 03:05:51,430
  and then later as a teacher   
  and now, as headmistress.     

4592
03:05:51,499 --> 03:05:53,332
      And it's always been      
      my favorite day           

4593
03:05:53,401 --> 03:05:55,167
      of the school year.       

4594
03:05:55,236 --> 03:05:56,669
     Although I've secretly     
     always wanted              

4595
03:05:56,738 --> 03:05:59,372
     to join                    
     the fishermen's choir!     

4596
03:05:59,440 --> 03:06:01,941
But now at least today I finally
get to wear the outfit!         

4597
03:06:02,010 --> 03:06:05,278
           (cheering)           

4598
03:06:05,346 --> 03:06:07,680
        Which is fitting        

4599
03:06:07,749 --> 03:06:10,249
    as this year is gonna be    
    my last year                

4600
03:06:10,318 --> 03:06:11,851
    here at Portwenn school.    

4601
03:06:11,920 --> 03:06:12,818
          (murmuring)           

4602
03:06:12,887 --> 03:06:15,288
         -Hey!                  
         -Do you mind?          

4603
03:06:15,356 --> 03:06:17,823
     (Louisa)                   
     ...trying to decide,       
     and even this morning,     

4604
03:06:17,892 --> 03:06:21,594
    I wasn't sure if I could    
    go through with this.       

4605
03:06:21,663 --> 03:06:24,263
      I know it's been          
      a difficult decision      

4606
03:06:24,332 --> 03:06:25,965
        as it's been            
        such a privilege        

4607
03:06:26,034 --> 03:06:29,101
 getting to know your children  
 and watching them grow         

4608
03:06:29,170 --> 03:06:33,506
   and making their brave       
   new steps into the world.    

4609
03:06:33,574 --> 03:06:35,608
           (Becky)              
           Look out!            

4610
03:06:35,677 --> 03:06:37,243
             (Bert)             
             Agh!               

4611
03:06:37,312 --> 03:06:40,880
    (Louisa)                    
    Well, I think it's time     
    for me to do the same.      

4612
03:06:40,949 --> 03:06:42,615
       (Joe)                    
       Don't go anywhere.       

4613
03:06:42,684 --> 03:06:44,483
            Oh, Joe.            

4614
03:06:44,552 --> 03:06:46,619
          -Not you.             
          -Oh, right.           

4615
03:06:46,688 --> 03:06:47,954
          (Joe)                 
          Right, move.          

4616
03:06:48,022 --> 03:06:49,322
        -Out of my way.         
        -So...                  

4617
03:06:49,390 --> 03:06:51,123
       -Out of the way.         
       -What I've learnt        

4618
03:06:51,192 --> 03:06:55,528
   from all of you              
   parents and children is--    

4619
03:06:55,596 --> 03:06:56,629
           is that...           

4620
03:06:56,698 --> 03:06:59,165
    Don't worry, I'll put it    
    all in the newsletter.      

4621
03:07:07,542 --> 03:07:09,408
  -Got a situation here, Doc.   
  -Hang on a minute!            

4622
03:07:09,477 --> 03:07:10,576
   I'm the one in pain here.    

4623
03:07:10,645 --> 03:07:12,244
       The car almost           
       went over my foot.       

4624
03:07:12,313 --> 03:07:13,913
  (Martin)                      
  I told you to get some rest   
  and stay at home,             

4625
03:07:13,982 --> 03:07:15,915
        and I told you          
        to stop driving.        

4626
03:07:15,984 --> 03:07:17,483
   (Graham)                     
   I have not been drinking.    

4627
03:07:17,552 --> 03:07:18,884
      (Joe)                     
      He's clearly              
      under the influence.      

4628
03:07:18,953 --> 03:07:20,786
 I'm gonna get my breathalyzer. 

4629
03:07:20,855 --> 03:07:23,556
    Doc, I have followed him    
    all night, all day.         

4630
03:07:23,624 --> 03:07:24,957
     He hasn't blinked          
     without me seeing it.      

4631
03:07:25,026 --> 03:07:26,525
    I've tasted every drink     
    he's had.                   

4632
03:07:26,594 --> 03:07:28,260
    I won't even let him go     
    to the bathroom alone.      

4633
03:07:28,329 --> 03:07:30,830
 -It's driving me crazy.        
 -He cannot have been drinking. 

4634
03:07:30,898 --> 03:07:31,697
            (Graham)            
            Exactly.            

4635
03:07:31,766 --> 03:07:32,832
           (belches)            

4636
03:07:32,900 --> 03:07:33,666
      (Martin)                  
      Well, his blood test      

4637
03:07:33,735 --> 03:07:35,334
showed the presence of alcohol, 

4638
03:07:35,403 --> 03:07:37,403
      but if you're             
      absolutely certain,       

4639
03:07:37,472 --> 03:07:39,038
      there might be            
      another explanation.      

4640
03:07:39,107 --> 03:07:41,774
  (Joe)                         
  I need you to blow into this  
  until I tell you to stop.     

4641
03:07:41,843 --> 03:07:43,776
     (Martin)                   
     Uh, no, don't bother.      

4642
03:07:43,845 --> 03:07:44,677
     He'd probably fail it,     

4643
03:07:44,746 --> 03:07:46,011
        but that doesn't        
        necessarily mean        

4644
03:07:46,080 --> 03:07:47,079
      he's been drinking.       

4645
03:07:47,148 --> 03:07:49,782
     You could have             
     auto-brewery syndrome.     

4646
03:07:49,851 --> 03:07:51,517
     I've never actually        
     come across it myself,     

4647
03:07:51,586 --> 03:07:54,854
  but fermentation in the gut   
  leads to ethanol production.  

4648
03:07:54,922 --> 03:07:56,455
     -Say again.                
     -You'd have to undergo     

4649
03:07:56,524 --> 03:07:57,857
        monitored tests         
        in hospital,            

4650
03:07:57,925 --> 03:07:59,091
      but if they confirm       
      the presence              

4651
03:07:59,160 --> 03:08:00,526
       of too much yeast        
       inside you,              

4652
03:08:00,595 --> 03:08:01,594
 and you haven't been drinking, 

4653
03:08:01,662 --> 03:08:03,095
      then your body            
      may well be brewing       

4654
03:08:03,164 --> 03:08:05,631
     its own alcohol supply     
     in your stomach.           

4655
03:08:05,700 --> 03:08:10,836
(Graham)                        
So what you're saying is,       
basically my body is a brewery? 

4656
03:08:10,905 --> 03:08:12,938
      (Martin)                  
      Yes, that's exactly       
      what I am saying.         

4657
03:08:13,007 --> 03:08:15,374
          (Graham)              
          Thanks, Doc.          

4658
03:08:15,443 --> 03:08:16,809
   (Martin)                     
   Come and see me tomorrow.    

4659
03:08:16,878 --> 03:08:18,110
           (Mel)                
           Thank you.           

4660
03:08:18,179 --> 03:08:21,113
        -Come on.               
        -Is that my car?        

4661
03:08:21,182 --> 03:08:22,448

   (Bert)                       
   Then I would like            
   to make a formal protest.    

4761
03:12:04,271 --> 03:12:05,971
  (Al)                          
  Dad, you're only protesting   
  'cause you're gonna lose      

4762
03:12:06,040 --> 03:12:07,906
    -a lot of money on this.    
    -'Cause I believe           

4763
03:12:07,975 --> 03:12:10,309
        in proper rules         
        and regulations.        

4764
03:12:10,377 --> 03:12:11,677
  Otherwise it's just anarchy.  

4765
03:12:11,745 --> 03:12:13,779
        (blows whistle)         

4766
03:12:13,848 --> 03:12:16,915
    (Joe)                       
    My official decision        
    is victory to Portwenn.     

4767
03:12:16,984 --> 03:12:17,783
           (cheering)           

4768
03:12:17,852 --> 03:12:19,184
   Morwenna, as team captain,   

4769
03:12:19,253 --> 03:12:22,921
    do you formally accept?     

4770
03:12:22,990 --> 03:12:24,223
      (Morwenna)                
      Yeah, I suppose so.       

4771
03:12:24,291 --> 03:12:25,724
           (cheering)           

4772
03:12:25,793 --> 03:12:27,059
        (Joe)                   
        Portwenn it is.         

4773
03:12:28,562 --> 03:12:30,429
   (Eric)                       
   I put 30 quid on Portwenn.   

4774
03:12:30,497 --> 03:12:31,964
     I'm gonna get my Ellie     
     something nice.            

4775
03:12:32,032 --> 03:12:33,165
        Time to pay up.         

4776
03:12:33,234 --> 03:12:35,200
 (Bert)                         
 I wish I had your luck, Eric.  

4777
03:12:35,269 --> 03:12:36,768
           (chuckles)           

4778
03:12:36,837 --> 03:12:38,370
     -I want my money too.      
     -Come on!                  

4779
03:12:38,439 --> 03:12:39,638
       -No, no.                 
       -You need someone        

4780
03:12:39,707 --> 03:12:41,206
       to look after you.       

4781
03:12:41,275 --> 03:12:41,940
             Shift!             

4782
03:12:42,009 --> 03:12:42,741
        Out of the way!         

4783
03:12:42,810 --> 03:12:44,076
             Shift!             

4784
03:12:44,144 --> 03:12:45,677
      (Louisa)                  
      Then I told everyone      
      I was leaving,            

4785
03:12:45,746 --> 03:12:47,512
 so there's no going back now.  

4786
03:12:47,581 --> 03:12:49,881
     (Martin)                   
     Well, that's good.         
     That's good, isn't it?     

4787
03:12:49,950 --> 03:12:51,850
And you're still sure           
you've made the right decision? 

4788
03:12:51,919 --> 03:12:54,720
   (Louisa)                     
   It's a bit late              
   to ask that now, isn't it?   

4789
03:12:54,788 --> 03:12:57,456
  No, of course I'm not sure.   

4790
03:12:57,524 --> 03:13:00,192
    But that's what makes it    
    exciting, I suppose.        

4791
03:13:00,261 --> 03:13:02,761
      You know, the risk.       

4792
03:13:02,830 --> 03:13:04,630
         I mean, yes,           
         I'd be worried         

4793
03:13:04,698 --> 03:13:06,465
    if you decided              
    to stop being a doctor.     

4794
03:13:06,533 --> 03:13:10,102
 But things don't have to stay  
 the same forever, do they?     

4795
03:13:13,807 --> 03:13:15,641
   Do you think your fainting   
   had anything to do           

4796
03:13:15,709 --> 03:13:18,443
with my circumstances changing? 

4797
03:13:18,512 --> 03:13:20,012
     (Martin)                   
     No, I don't think so.      

4798
03:13:20,080 --> 03:13:21,847
   (Louisa)                     
   Yes, 'cause you do like      
   a controlled environment,    

4799
03:13:21,915 --> 03:13:23,115
          -don't you?           
          -Louisa,              

4800
03:13:23,183 --> 03:13:24,583
      you've only just          
      started this course.      

4801
03:13:24,652 --> 03:13:26,018
      Please don't use me       
      as a test case.           

4802
03:13:26,086 --> 03:13:27,119
      (Louisa)                  
      I'm simply                
      gathering a picture       

4803
03:13:27,187 --> 03:13:29,388
      of your symptoms,         
      Martin, that's all.       

4804
03:13:29,456 --> 03:13:31,189
          -Hello.               
          -Hi, Chris.           

4805
03:13:31,258 --> 03:13:32,591
  -Did you come for the race?   
  -What?                        

4806
03:13:32,660 --> 03:13:34,593
       Oh, no, no, no,          
       I missed all that.       

4807
03:13:34,662 --> 03:13:39,164
     Actually, I'm--            
     I'm here on business.      

4808
03:13:39,233 --> 03:13:40,599
      Look, perhaps             
      we could have a talk      

4809
03:13:40,668 --> 03:13:42,567
   in private somewhere, hm?    

4810
03:13:42,636 --> 03:13:43,735
   (Louisa)                     
   Sure, yeah, you carry on.    

4811
03:13:43,804 --> 03:13:45,103
   I've got to get              
   this little one some food.   

4812
03:13:45,172 --> 03:13:47,739
    Come in for a cup of tea    
    before you go.              

4813
03:13:47,808 --> 03:13:49,641
          -Please.              
          -Oh, right.           

4814
03:13:53,313 --> 03:13:56,281
          -What is it?          
          -Um, yes.             

4815
03:13:56,350 --> 03:13:57,916
      Uh, right,                
      well, to the point.       

4816
03:13:57,985 --> 03:14:02,387
   Um, I'm afraid               
   you're in trouble, Martin.   

4817
03:14:02,456 --> 03:14:03,455
       There's a patient.       

4818
03:14:03,524 --> 03:14:04,723
    I tried to talk to her,     

4819
03:14:04,792 --> 03:14:06,391
    I tried to persuade her     
    not to make a complaint,    

4820
03:14:06,460 --> 03:14:08,560
  but she'd already got         
  the powers that be involved.  

4821
03:14:10,297 --> 03:14:12,564
   Martin,                      
   she wants you struck off.    

4822
03:14:12,633 --> 03:14:14,933
         -"She" being?          
         -Alice Taylor.         

4823
03:14:15,002 --> 03:14:15,967
I believe you drained her cyst? 

4824
03:14:16,036 --> 03:14:16,902
     (Martin)                   
     Her Baker's cyst, yes.     

4825
03:14:16,970 --> 03:14:18,003
  I treated her successfully.   

4826
03:14:18,072 --> 03:14:19,037
   (Chris)                      
   But the patient passed out   

4827
03:14:19,106 --> 03:14:20,038
       and she's claiming       
       you did as well.         

4828
03:14:20,107 --> 03:14:22,507
     Is that--is that true?     

4829
03:14:24,545 --> 03:14:26,044
      Normally, I could         
      make this disappear.      

4830
03:14:26,113 --> 03:14:28,947
   But it seems Alice Taylor    
   is a solicitor.              

4831
03:14:29,016 --> 03:14:30,282
   She made an almighty fuss,   

4832
03:14:30,350 --> 03:14:32,417
    which is how she's got      
    this moving so quickly.     

4833
03:14:32,486 --> 03:14:34,786
  (Martin)                      
  What exactly is she saying?   

4834
03:14:34,855 --> 03:14:37,022
    (Chris)                     
    You're accused of being     
    too ill to work safely.     

4835
03:14:37,091 --> 03:14:38,990
   Look, it could be serious.   

4836
03:14:39,059 --> 03:14:41,493
If your phobia is out of control
and you really can't cope--     

4837
03:14:41,562 --> 03:14:42,994
 (Martin)                       
 No, nothing is out of control. 

4838
03:14:43,063 --> 03:14:44,729
    The woman was suffering     
    from concussion.            

4839
03:14:44,798 --> 03:14:46,465
      She didn't know           
      what she was saying.      

4840
03:14:46,533 --> 03:14:48,733
She wouldn't let me help her    
when she collapsed on her boat. 

4841
03:14:48,802 --> 03:14:50,435
   (Chris)                      
   Well, she collapsed again    
   and you tried to help her?   

4842
03:14:50,504 --> 03:14:51,736
     (Martin)                   
     Yes, of course I did,      
     that's what I do,          

4843
03:14:51,805 --> 03:14:53,371
  -I'm a doctor.                
  -Well, you need to stay away  

4844
03:14:53,440 --> 03:14:54,439
    from her                    
    till this is sorted out.    

4845
03:14:54,508 --> 03:14:55,407
       -I certainly will.       
       -In fact, you need       

4846
03:14:55,476 --> 03:14:57,075
to stay away from all patients.

(Nick)                          
We're using 35-mil camera lenses

4904
03:17:51,318 --> 03:17:53,218
     which are what we call     
     prime lenses.              

4905
03:17:53,286 --> 03:17:54,953
    They're not a zoom lens,    
    so you choose               

4906
03:17:55,021 --> 03:17:58,523
      your length of lens       
      for the size of shot      

4907
03:17:58,592 --> 03:17:59,591
    and you stick with that,    

4908
03:17:59,659 --> 03:18:01,459
        and the only way        
        of changing that        

4909
03:18:01,528 --> 03:18:03,461
     is to move the camera      
     towards the artists        

4910
03:18:03,530 --> 03:18:05,363

      towards the camera.       

4911
03:18:05,432 --> 03:18:06,664
There's a lovely depth of field 

4912
03:18:06,733 --> 03:18:09,734
   which means the background   
   is slightly soft focus,

        seafood together.       

5085
03:27:01,767 --> 03:27:04,601
    He died when I was 11.      

5086
03:27:04,603 --> 03:27:06,904
When I decided to open Hank's,  

5087
03:27:06,906 --> 03:27:11,275
 I thought, "What a perfect name
 and a nice homage to him."     

5088
03:27:11,277 --> 03:27:13,010
[People speaking indistinctly]  

5089
03:27:13,012 --> 03:27:15,679
     Not only do we buy from    
     around the country,        

5090
03:27:15,681 --> 03:27:18,582
    but we also have            
    our own local oysters       

5091
03:27:18,584 --> 03:27:20,584
that you can only get here.     

5092
03:27:22,054 --> 03:27:24,655
    Originally, one of the      
    farmers just walked in      

5093
03:27:24,657 --> 03:27:26,657
     and shucked his oysters    
     right in front of me.      

5094
03:27:26,659 --> 03:27:28,625
     I tasted it, and it was    
     a great oyster.            

5095
03:27:28,627 --> 03:27:30,427
    I said, "OK, you're in."    

5096
03:27:33,065 --> 03:27:35,098
         Woman: My first        
        oyster was here.        

5097
03:27:35,100 --> 03:27:36,600
        I used to put           
        a little Tabasco        

5098
03:27:36,602 --> 03:27:38,502
        and maybe a saltine     
        cracker or something,   

5099
03:27:38,504 --> 03:27:41,371
        but now I just          
        shuck 'em and eat 'em.  

5100
03:27:41,373 --> 03:27:42,873
            She doesn't like    
            the cocktail sauce, 

5101
03:27:42,875 --> 03:27:44,575
            so we get one side  
            of horseradish      

5102
03:27:44,577 --> 03:27:47,244
         and one with cocktail  
        sauce and horseradish.  

5103
03:27:47,246 --> 03:27:49,313
       Makes the                
       relationship work.       
Ha ha!

    seafood menu.               

5107
03:28:00,392 --> 03:28:05,028
I wanted to be able to offer    
a non-seafood option as well.   

5108
03:28:05,030 --> 03:28:06,530
    Sunday night is             
    fried chicken night.        

5109
03:28:06,532 --> 03:28:07,998
    That's a big night.         

5110
03:28:08,000 --> 03:28:11,101
 They've got the small plates,  
the large plates and specials,  

5111
03:28:11,103 --> 03:28:13,904
so I'm trying something new     
tonight, which is the salmon.   

5112
03:28:13,906 --> 03:28:16,240
     Everything you get here    
     is just amazing.           

5113
03:28:16,242 --> 03:28:18,108
