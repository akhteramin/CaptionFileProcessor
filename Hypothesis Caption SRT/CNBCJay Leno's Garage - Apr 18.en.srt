 EPCLUSA treats all main types  
       of chronic Hep C.        

893
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,752
      Whatever your type,

       I knew for years.        

900
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:31,886
      EPCLUSA is only one

901
00:24:31,921 --> 00:24:34,772
     taken with or without      
       food for 12 weeks.       

902
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,724
    Before starting EPCLUSA,    
        your doctor will        

903
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:39,443
      test if you have had      
hepatitis B, which may flare up 

904
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:41,479
        and could cause         
     serious liver problems     

905
00:24:41,531 --> 00:24:43,230
  during and after treatment.   

906
00:24:43,265 --> 00:24:45,316
    Tell your doctor if you     
      have had hepatitis B      

907
00:24:45,368 --> 00:24:48,068
         other liver or

 including herbal supplements.

00:24:52,542 --> 00:24:54,458
       Taking amiodarone

911
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:56,744
    cause a serious slowing     
      of your heart rate.

00:24:56,779 --> 00:25:00,047
  Common side effects include   
     headache and tiredness

970
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:45,235
The wooden Ferrari was created  

971
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:46,937

Livio De Marchi,

who's from Venice, Italy        

974
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:49,740

976

and make one every single year. 

979
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:56,880
He wanted to start making these 

980
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:58,349

981

some of other boats.            

982
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:00,751
He was in a wooden paddleboat,  

983
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:01,418
and he really needed            

984

For something completely        

1389
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:40,977
different, let's take a look at 

1390
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:43,079
the 1916 Crane-Simplex.

>> Well, I know a little

something about this one,       

1393
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:45,749
'cause it's my car.             

1394
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,484
Holbrook was the body-builder,  

1395
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:49,486
and Crane-Simplex was meant to  

1396
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:51,988
be an American Rolls-Royce.     

1397
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:53,022
The thing that makes this one   

1398
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:54,891
interesting was, they built     

1399
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:56,559
really big, boxy,

boring limousines.              

1401
00:39:57,995 --> 00:39:59,562
So this is a one-off car        

1402
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:00,997
that was built specifically

I'm impressed.
