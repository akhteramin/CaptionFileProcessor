   AT COMPLETELY CLEAR SKIN.

DON'T USE IF YOU'RE             
ALLERGIC TO TALTZ.              

1509
00:46:00,457 --> 00:46:02,957
  BEFORE STARTING, YOU SHOULD   
  BE CHECKED FOR TUBERCULOSIS.  

1510
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:04,659
       TALTZ MAY INCREASE       
       RISK OF INFECTIONS       

1511
00:46:04,727 --> 00:46:06,494
     AND LOWER YOUR             
     ABILITY TO FIGHT THEM.     

1512
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:07,428
    TELL YOUR                   
    DOCTOR IF YOU               

1513
00:46:07,497 --> 00:46:08,896
        HAVE AN

1515
00:46:11,167 --> 00:46:13,067
      INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE
      CAN HAPPEN WITH TALTZ,    

1516
00:46:13,136 --> 00:46:14,769
INCLUDING WORSENING OF SYMPTOMS.

1517
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:16,904
      SERIOUS ALLERGIC

1518
00:46:16,973 --> 00:46:18,840

1519
00:46:18,908 --> 00:46:21,008
  ASK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT TALTZ.

00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:24,078
