1
00:00:01,052 --> 00:00:02,985
 the technical defense.         

2
00:00:03,054 --> 00:00:04,153
    "I was at my apartment,     
      I don't live there."      

3
00:00:04,221 --> 00:00:05,454
            (woman)             
             - No.              

4
00:00:05,523 --> 00:00:07,656
 - You could easily have said,  
    "I co-hosted the party,     

5
00:00:07,725 --> 00:00:08,957
   and I told the police that   
   and that's why I'm here."    

6
00:00:10,494 --> 00:00:12,294
So, baby, you had to bring your 
  mother to court today, huh?   

7
00:00:12,363 --> 00:00:13,395
            - I did.            

8
00:00:13,464 --> 00:00:14,596
        - Are you still         
   spoon-feeding him or not?    

9
00:00:16,067 --> 00:00:18,033
Did you know that you could not 
   park there with a placard?   

10
00:00:18,102 --> 00:00:19,802
        - I only parked         
       there 30 seconds.        

11
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,471
  - You were there 30 seconds?  
     - 30-45 seconds, ah...     

12
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:23,472
      - You keep talking,       
         they're gonna          

13
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:24,473
           take your            
     handicap placard away.     

14
00:00:26,077 --> 00:00:28,677
          (announcer)           
    - This is the courtroom     
     of Judge Frank Caprio,     

15
00:00:28,746 --> 00:00:31,413
     where people and cases     
    are met with compassion.    

16
00:00:31,482 --> 00:00:33,415
   A different kind of judge.   

17
00:00:33,484 --> 00:00:35,317
          A courtroom           
         like no other.         

18
00:00:35,386 --> 00:00:36,985
This is "Caught in Providence." 

19
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:39,455
         (Judge Caprio)         
       - Nicholas Damon.        

20
00:00:41,192 --> 00:00:42,825
  - Good morning, Your Honor.   

21
00:00:42,893 --> 00:00:44,059
         (Judge Caprio)         
       - Okay, Mr. Damon,       

22
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:46,295
      you're charged with       
   going through a red light    

23
00:00:46,364 --> 00:00:49,698
    on Roger Williams Avenue    
       and Elmwood Avenue       

24
00:00:49,767 --> 00:00:52,134
    at 10:18 in the morning.    

25
00:00:53,304 --> 00:00:54,636
          Is this your          
        lawyer with you?        

26
00:00:54,705 --> 00:00:56,505
      - This is my mother.      
         - I'm his mom.         

27
00:00:59,143 --> 00:01:01,076
   - When are you gonna stop    
   taking care of these kids?   

28
00:01:01,145 --> 00:01:03,312
        - I don't know.         

29
00:01:03,381 --> 00:01:05,547
    - How long does it take     
    before you cut the cord?    

30
00:01:05,616 --> 00:01:06,548
            - Never.            

31
00:01:06,617 --> 00:01:07,649
         (Judge Caprio)         
            - Never.            

32
00:01:07,718 --> 00:01:09,385
            - Never.            
    - That's a good answer.     

33
00:01:09,453 --> 00:01:11,220
            - Now...            

34
00:01:11,288 --> 00:01:13,322
    this is a classic case,     
        Inspector Quinn,        

35
00:01:13,391 --> 00:01:15,391
       of a mother coming       
  to court for her little boy.  

36
00:01:15,459 --> 00:01:16,825
     - Yup, it's her baby.      

37
00:01:16,894 --> 00:01:17,993
         She's here for         
           her baby.            

38
00:01:18,062 --> 00:01:19,061
         (Judge Caprio)         
   - She's here for her baby.   

39
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,929
     "I have to go to court     
         for my baby."          

40
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:22,197
        Do you have any         
       younger than him?        

41
00:01:22,266 --> 00:01:24,133
           - No, no.            
       - No, only child.        

42
00:01:24,201 --> 00:01:25,300
         (Judge Caprio)         
      - So he's your baby.      

43
00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:27,503
     - He's my baby, yeah,      
       he's my only one.        

44
00:01:27,571 --> 00:01:29,838
  - So, baby, you had to bring  
your mother to court today, huh?

45
00:01:29,907 --> 00:01:31,173
        - I did, I did.         

46
00:01:31,242 --> 00:01:32,174
    (Judge Caprio chuckling)    

47
00:01:32,243 --> 00:01:33,609
      Hopefully it helps.       

48
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:35,077
 - Are you still spoon-feeding  
          him or not?           

49
00:01:35,146 --> 00:01:36,078
             - No.              

50
00:01:36,147 --> 00:01:37,079
         (Judge Caprio)         
             - No?              

51
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:39,682
         Well, he's...          

52
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,016
       he's charged with        
   going through a red light.   

53
00:01:41,085 --> 00:01:42,418
    We're gonna look at it.     

54
00:01:42,486 --> 00:01:43,752
            - Good.             

55
00:01:43,821 --> 00:01:45,587
      - What is your name?      
            - Kerri.            

56
00:01:45,656 --> 00:01:46,889
            - Kerri.            
            - Damon.            

57
00:01:46,957 --> 00:01:48,257
            - Damon.            

58
00:01:48,325 --> 00:01:49,258
      Well, come up here.       

59
00:01:51,228 --> 00:01:52,995
         Come up here,          
         come up here.          

60
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,199
      - You know, it's not      
    gonna end well for you,     

61
00:01:57,268 --> 00:01:58,901
   so get rid of that smile.    

62
00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:00,536
        - Get over here.        
            - Okay.             

63
00:02:00,604 --> 00:02:01,904
        - We're gonna--         
  you've gotta give me a hand   

64
00:02:01,972 --> 00:02:03,605
  on deciding this case, okay?  

65
00:02:03,674 --> 00:02:05,007
       - Okay, all right.       
   - You've gotta be honest.    

66
00:02:05,076 --> 00:02:06,942
   - I will be honest, yeah.    
          - All right.          

67
00:02:07,011 --> 00:02:09,244
     - No special leniency.     
     - No special leniency.     

68
00:02:09,313 --> 00:02:11,280
  - All right, so, okay, so--   
     - He hasn't had any...     

69
00:02:11,349 --> 00:02:13,415
          - All right,          
  so I'm gonna get over here,   

70
00:02:13,484 --> 00:02:14,683
        you're gonna get        
           over here,           

71
00:02:14,752 --> 00:02:17,386
      and we're gonna look      
    at the video right here.    

72
00:02:17,455 --> 00:02:19,288
     Okay, Lisa, let's go.      

73
00:02:19,357 --> 00:02:20,456
       The light is red.        

74
00:02:24,095 --> 00:02:25,694
             And...             

75
00:02:25,763 --> 00:02:27,997
    - Uh... I thought it was    
        a right on red.         

76
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,298
         (Judge Caprio)         
    - Hold on for a minute.     

77
00:02:29,367 --> 00:02:30,299
       The light is red.        

78
00:02:31,869 --> 00:02:33,168
       He's coming down.        

79
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:37,006
          And he made           
       a right-hand turn.       

80
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,440
  Okay, now, what do you wanna  
      tell me about that?       

81
00:02:38,509 --> 00:02:39,808
         - Well, he did         
      have his brakes on.       

82
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:42,678
      (attendees laughing)      

83
00:02:42,747 --> 00:02:46,148
       And it was a slow,       
        it was a slow...        

84
00:02:46,217 --> 00:02:49,418
     - You... you can take      
a right turn on red over there. 

85
00:02:49,487 --> 00:02:50,719
      It does have a sign       
          that says--           

86
00:02:50,788 --> 00:02:51,720
 - I'm talking to your mother.  

87
00:02:51,789 --> 00:02:53,322
    - All right, all right,     
             sorry.             

88
00:02:53,391 --> 00:02:54,823
         - Be careful.          

89
00:02:54,892 --> 00:02:56,525
        - I guess it was        
        a rolling stop.         

90
00:02:56,594 --> 00:02:59,228
    - It was a rolling stop.    

91
00:02:59,297 --> 00:03:01,063
           You don't            
       think he stopped.        

92
00:03:01,132 --> 00:03:02,531
            (Kerri)             
            - Um...             

93
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,333
         No, he didn't          
      stop completely, no.      

94
00:03:06,337 --> 00:03:07,870
     - You agree with that,     
        Inspector Quinn?        

95
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:09,972
      - She took the words      
 right out of my mouth, Judge.  

96
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:11,473
         (Judge Caprio)         
            - Yeah?             

97
00:03:11,542 --> 00:03:13,142
         So what do you         
  think we should do with him?  

98
00:03:14,445 --> 00:03:15,544
            - Um...             

99
00:03:15,613 --> 00:03:17,379
    I don't know, I've done     
      a lot to him already      

100
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:19,181
          and screamed          
        at him about it,        

101
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,616
       and I-- I don't--        

102
00:03:20,685 --> 00:03:21,717
           - Did you            
          beat him up?          

103
00:03:21,786 --> 00:03:22,718
        - I didn't beat         
            him up.             

104
00:03:22,787 --> 00:03:23,852
       No, I couldn't...        

105
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:25,888
       - Wanna use this?        
      - I could use this.       

106
00:03:25,957 --> 00:03:27,790
      (attendees laughing)      

107
00:03:30,027 --> 00:03:31,193
          - All right.          

108
00:03:31,262 --> 00:03:32,962
       Like every mother,       
   like every mother, right,    

109
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,464
       she sees the good        
       in her son, right?       

110
00:03:35,533 --> 00:03:37,299
        You're still her        
          little baby.          

111
00:03:37,368 --> 00:03:39,869
          You can make          
   a right-hand turn on red.    

112
00:03:39,937 --> 00:03:41,570
        At this location

115
00:03:45,042 --> 00:03:46,675

 Puffs Plus Lotion, instead.    

227
00:08:14,012 --> 00:08:17,114
   With lotion to soothe and    
   softness to please.          

228
00:08:17,182 --> 00:09:24,315
    A nose in need deserves     
    Puffs, indeed.

00:09:25,518 --> 00:09:26,450
         (Judge Caprio)         
        - Muammer Tukar.        

231
00:09:27,887 --> 00:09:29,153
       Good morning, sir,       
    you are charged with...     

232
00:09:29,222 --> 00:09:30,387
        - Good morning.         

233
00:09:30,456 --> 00:09:31,889
    - ... parking overnight.    

234
00:09:33,326 --> 00:09:34,558
          - Uh, yeah.           

235
00:09:34,627 --> 00:09:37,428
    First of all, I am sorry    
        for my English.         

236
00:09:37,497 --> 00:09:38,863
             Uh...

      I am learn-- I am--

          I am trying           
       to learn English.        

239
00:09:42,468 --> 00:09:45,436
   If I say something wrong,    
      I am sorry for this.      

240
00:09:45,505 --> 00:09:46,670
        - You can't say         
      anything wrong here.      

241
00:09:46,739 --> 00:09:47,671
           (Muammer)            
            - Okay.             

242
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,173
     - Where are you from?      
           - Turkey.            

243
00:09:49,242 --> 00:09:50,307
           - How long           
      have you been here?       

244
00:09:50,376 --> 00:09:52,243
     - Uh, ten months here.     

245
00:09:52,311 --> 00:09:53,311
         - You're doing         
          pretty good.          

246
00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:54,712
     - Thank you very much.     

247
00:09:54,781 --> 00:09:56,280
    - Yeah, what do you do?     
       Are you a student?       

248
00:09:56,349 --> 00:09:58,416
        - I am-- I am...

00:09:58,484 --> 00:10:02,320
   studying in-- I am student   
      in Brown University,      

250
00:10:02,388 --> 00:10:04,722
   and I am working in labs.    

251
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,958
          And today...          

252
00:10:07,026 --> 00:10:08,192
          first time,           

253
00:10:08,261 --> 00:10:12,330
         I park my car          
            in 3:00             

254
00:10:12,398 --> 00:10:15,900
           and after            
      one and half hour...      

255
00:10:15,969 --> 00:10:17,535
           when I...            

256
00:10:17,604 --> 00:10:19,570
          when I come           
        to near my car,         

257
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:22,373
      I found a violation       
         parking ticket         

258
00:10:22,442 --> 00:10:26,310
      and there is no sign      
   about the no parking here    

259
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:28,212
    because this is not own.    

260
00:10:28,281 --> 00:10:32,350
        I just-- I want         
 to just study in lab two hours 

261
00:10:32,419 --> 00:10:33,651
             but...             

262
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,254
      and there is no sign      
        about no parking        

263
00:10:36,323 --> 00:10:37,755
    or no overnight parking.    

264
00:10:37,824 --> 00:10:38,890
            - Okay.             

265
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,026
       Have you ever been       
     in a court in Turkey?      

266
00:10:42,095 --> 00:10:44,095
     - No, first time here.     

267
00:10:44,164 --> 00:10:45,096
         (Judge Caprio)         
     - First time in court?     

268
00:10:45,165 --> 00:10:46,631
          - First time          
          in my life,           

269
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,300
   and I am excited about it.   

270
00:10:49,369 --> 00:10:51,836
  - Well, we hope we give you   
     a favorable impression     

271
00:10:51,905 --> 00:10:54,305
      of the United States      
        judicial system.        

272
00:10:54,374 --> 00:10:55,840
        All right, so...        

273
00:10:55,909 --> 00:10:59,244
     let me explain to you      
  what the situation is, okay?  

274
00:10:59,312 --> 00:11:02,414
      Everything you said       
          is accurate.          

275
00:11:02,482 --> 00:11:03,982
      Everything you said.      

276
00:11:04,051 --> 00:11:05,450
       There are no signs       
            that say            

277
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,253
           you cannot           
   park overnight, all right?   

278
00:11:08,322 --> 00:11:11,423
    And, plus, to complicate    
         matters more,          

279
00:11:11,491 --> 00:11:12,490
     there's a sign saying      

280
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:15,293
      you can park during       
         certain hours,         

281
00:11:15,362 --> 00:11:18,196
    and you were not parked     
  during those certain hours,   

282
00:11:18,265 --> 00:11:20,832
       so, in your mind,        
       "I can park here."       

283
00:11:20,901 --> 00:11:22,567
    Which makes sense to me.    

284
00:11:22,636 --> 00:11:25,604
      Except that the city      
            has a...            

285
00:11:25,672 --> 00:11:26,972
      a set of ordinances.      

286
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:34,746
    These are the city laws.    

287
00:11:34,815 --> 00:11:37,682
      And in here it says       
   you cannot park overnight    

288
00:11:37,751 --> 00:11:39,284
         in Providence.         

289
00:11:39,353 --> 00:11:41,386
      So, before you came       
          from Turkey,          

290
00:11:41,455 --> 00:11:43,121
       you were supposed        
       to read this book.       

291
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,756
      - Read all of that?       

292
00:11:44,825 --> 00:11:47,559
       I have just two--        
        two months here.        

293
00:11:47,628 --> 00:11:49,394
    (Judge Caprio chuckling)    

294
00:11:49,463 --> 00:11:51,430
            - So...             

295
00:11:51,498 --> 00:11:53,365
          it's a very           
        confusing thing.        

296
00:11:53,434 --> 00:11:55,367
      People in Providence      
        know they can't,        

297
00:11:55,436 --> 00:11:57,469
       but I don't think        
        it's fair for us        

298
00:11:57,538 --> 00:11:59,171
         to charge you          
     for parking overnight,     

299
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,439
       when, number one,        
        you didn't know,        

300
00:12:00,507 --> 00:12:02,674
          number two,           
 the sign was very misleading.  

301
00:12:02,743 --> 00:12:04,710
  So that's the short version   
           of saying            

302
00:12:04,778 --> 00:12:07,012
    that you won your case.     

303
00:12:07,081 --> 00:12:08,814
          So when you           
      get back to Turkey,       

304
00:12:08,883 --> 00:12:11,016
     you can say, "I was in     
       the United States,       

305
00:12:11,085 --> 00:12:13,118
        "and I received         
   a summons to go to court,    

306
00:12:13,187 --> 00:12:15,821
    and I fought the system     
          and I won."           

307
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,556
        - Am I won now?         

308
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:18,557
         (Judge Caprio)         
           - You win.           

309
00:12:18,626 --> 00:12:20,359
        - Oh, thank you         
           very much.           

310
00:12:20,428 --> 00:12:22,428
    (Judge Caprio chuckling)    

311
00:12:22,496 --> 00:12:23,762
           Thank you.           

312
00:12:23,831 --> 00:12:25,331
      - Good luck to you,       
    the matter is dismissed.    

313
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:27,132
      You did a-- you did       
        a wonderful job.        

314
00:12:27,201 --> 00:12:28,434
     - Thank you very much.     

315
00:12:28,502 --> 00:12:29,535
        Thank you again.        

316
00:12:31,172 --> 00:12:33,239
     - As many of you know,     
      videos of our cases       

317
00:12:33,307 --> 00:12:35,307
       have been watched        
    nearly two billion times    

318
00:12:35,376 --> 00:12:37,176
   on social media platforms    

319
00:12:37,245 --> 00:12:39,378
        such as YouTube         
         and Facebook.          

320
00:12:39,447 --> 00:12:42,648
    Over half of these views    
  come from foreign countries.  

321
00:12:42,717 --> 00:12:44,617
       Almost universally       

322
00:12:44,685 --> 00:12:46,252
      the viewers comment       
        that they wished        

323
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,421
     the court proceedings      
       in their countries       

324
00:12:48,489 --> 00:12:51,557
          were as fair          
 as the ones in our courtroom.  

325
00:12:51,626 --> 00:12:53,225
   While not always perfect,    

326
00:12:53,294 --> 00:12:55,027
       the United States        
        judicial system         

327
00:12:55,096 --> 00:12:56,762
    is based on the premise     

328
00:12:56,831 --> 00:13:00,032
   that everyone is innocent    
      until proven guilty.      

329
00:13:00,101 --> 00:13:01,968
           That's not           
      the case everywhere.      

330
00:13:02,036 --> 00:13:04,503
    I'm pleased that we were    
      able to demonstrate       

331
00:13:04,572 --> 00:13:07,506
     that concept in person     
          to Mr. Tukar          

332
00:13:07,575 --> 00:13:09,308
          in the hope           
         that he enjoys         

333
00:13:09,377 --> 00:13:11,444
      the rest of his stay      
     in our great country.      

334
00:13:13,681 --> 00:13:14,714
        Juliana Roland.         

335
00:13:16,217 --> 00:13:17,183
  - Good morning, Your Honor.   

336
00:13:17,252 --> 00:13:18,251
         (Judge Caprio)         
    - Good morning, Juliana.    

337
00:13:18,319 --> 00:13:19,418
       Juliana, you have        
       a speeding ticket        

338
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,788
     on Chalkstone Avenue,      
       in a school zone.        

339
00:13:21,856 --> 00:13:23,289
             - Yes.             

340
00:13:23,358 --> 00:13:24,323
         (Judge Caprio)         
      - Is there anything       
    you wanna tell me about?    

341
00:13:24,392 --> 00:13:25,458
       - Yes, Your Honor.       

342
00:13:25,527 --> 00:13:26,659
         I'm here from          
        South Carolina.         

343
00:13:26,728 --> 00:13:28,327
  I reside in South Carolina.   

344
00:13:28,396 --> 00:13:29,362
        - In Lexington.         

345
00:13:29,431 --> 00:13:30,496
           (Juliana)            
       - And-- I'm sorry.       

346
00:13:30,565 --> 00:13:31,731
- In Lexington, South Carolina. 

347
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,232
        - No, actually,         
       I'm in Blythewood.       

348
00:13:33,301 --> 00:13:34,233
         (Judge Caprio)         
             - Oh--             

349
00:13:34,302 --> 00:13:35,268
   - It was a rental vehicle.   

350
00:13:35,337 --> 00:13:36,469
             - Oh.              

351
00:13:36,538 --> 00:13:38,638
         - I have been          
out of the state of Rhode Island

352
00:13:38,707 --> 00:13:40,640
          since 1994,           

353
00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:42,442
         and I was back         
       visiting my dad--        

354
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,476
         88 years old.          

355
00:13:43,545 --> 00:13:45,011
        He was entering         
     hospice that weekend.      

356
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,280
           And so...            

357
00:13:47,349 --> 00:13:48,281
       I'm familiar with        
           the area.            

358
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,582
   I lived on Pembroke Avenue   

359
00:13:49,651 --> 00:13:53,119
    just, you know, north of    
Nathanael Greene Middle School. 

360
00:13:53,188 --> 00:13:54,387
  I'm familiar with the area.   

361
00:13:54,456 --> 00:13:57,824
   I was staying at a rental    
     property in Providence     

362
00:13:57,893 --> 00:14:00,460
    and just picked up speed    
     going down that hill.      

363
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:02,228
      Didn't see the sign       
      for the school zone.      

364
00:14:02,297 --> 00:14:04,364
 I know Nathanael Greene School 
           is there.            

365
00:14:04,433 --> 00:14:07,734
   I've had one speed ticket    
   in my driving life, 1991,    

366
00:14:07,803 --> 00:14:09,536
 on the New York State Thruway. 

367
00:14:09,605 --> 00:14:11,871
      I had that dismissed      
  because I was a safe driver.  

368
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,306
        I just taught my        
     16-year-old to drive.      

369
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,408
  She was licensed last week.   

370
00:14:15,477 --> 00:14:18,778
  So, I'm asking forgiveness,   
        if not leniency         

371
00:14:18,847 --> 00:14:20,213
        for this because        
      I am a safe driver,       

372
00:14:20,282 --> 00:14:22,916
      and... I'm certainly      
     guilty of the charge,      

373
00:14:22,985 --> 00:14:24,951
           but, um...           

374
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:28,255
  - Well, you're one mile over  
what I would charge ordinarily. 

375
00:14:28,323 --> 00:14:30,357
           I have...            

376
00:14:30,426 --> 00:14:31,825
        I have an issue,        
         not a problem.         

377
00:14:31,894 --> 00:14:33,327
  I have an issue with that--   

378
00:14:33,395 --> 00:14:37,097
          the location          
 of that particular mechanism,  

379
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:39,366
   because Chalkstone Avenue    
    is a hill going down...     

380
00:14:39,435 --> 00:14:40,867
         - Yes, it is,          
          yes, it is.           

381
00:14:40,936 --> 00:14:42,536
   - ... into Raymond Street,   

382
00:14:42,605 --> 00:14:44,104
        and that's where        
    they've got the machine.    

383
00:14:44,173 --> 00:14:45,339
     So you actually would      
           have to be           

384
00:14:45,407 --> 00:14:48,108
       pumping the brakes       
      going down the hill       

385
00:14:48,177 --> 00:14:49,776
         to be going...         

386
00:14:49,845 --> 00:14:50,978
         to keep within         
        the speed limit,        

387
00:14:51,046 --> 00:14:52,579
     and you were one over      
     what I usually charge,     

388
00:14:52,648 --> 00:14:53,914
     so I'm gonna give you      
            a break.            

389
00:14:53,983 --> 00:14:55,983
          - Thank you,          
     thank you, Your Honor.     

390
00:14:56,051 --> 00:14:57,451
    - Is it your dad that's     
      going into hospice?       

391
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,086
   - He passed on June 12th,    

392
00:14:59,155 --> 00:15:00,954
             so...              

393
00:15:01,023 --> 00:15:02,923
      last time I saw him       
  but it was good to be here.   

394
00:15:02,992 --> 00:15:04,391
         But nice gift.         

395
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,626
 But thank you for dismissing,  
          Your Honor.           

396
00:15:05,695 --> 00:15:06,627
        I appreciate it.        

397
00:15:06,696 --> 00:15:07,728
          - In memory           
          of your dad.          

398
00:15:07,797 --> 00:15:09,463
    - Thank you, thank you--    
          thanks, Dad.          

399
00:15:09,532 --> 00:15:10,731
          - Good luck.          

400
00:15:12,034 --> 00:15:12,967
        You actually had        
     a pretty good morning.     

401
00:15:13,035 --> 00:15:13,968
         You know that.         

402
00:15:14,036 --> 00:15:15,069
  - Both tickets were not me,   

403
00:15:15,137 --> 00:15:16,103
       and I have to pay        
    somebody else's mistake.    

404
00:15:16,172 --> 00:15:17,705
      Yeah, it's a pretty       
         great morning.         

405
00:15:17,773 --> 00:15:19,273
         (Judge Caprio)         
   - I think you better leave   
    before I change my mind.    

406
00:15:37,827 --> 00:15:39,660
 Around here, nobody ever does  
 it.                            

407
00:15:39,729 --> 00:15:40,661
        I Didn't do it.         

408
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,163
So when I heard they added Ultra
Oxi                             

409
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:44,465
 to the cleaning power of Tide, 
 it was just what we needed.    

410
00:15:44,534 --> 00:15:45,466
              Dad?              

411
00:15:45,535 --> 00:15:46,767
        I didn't do it.         

412
00:15:46,836 --> 00:15:50,071
 <i> #1 stain and odor fighter, #1</i>

414

      Stand up to Chronic       
     Migraine with BOTOX®.      

415
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:45,494
What if you had fewer headaches 
     and migraines a month?     

416
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,563
        BOTOX® prevents         
    headaches and migraines     

417
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:49,831
    before they even start.     

418
00:16:50,367 --> 00:16:52,501
      BOTOX® is for adults      
     with Chronic Migraine,     

419
00:16:52,569 --> 00:16:54,236
      15 or more headache       
         days a month,          

420
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:56,004
 each lasting 4 hours or more.  

421
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,675
  BOTOX® injections take about  
15 mins. in your doctor's office

422
00:16:59,743 --> 00:17:01,777
        and are covered         
       by most insurance.       

423
00:17:02,112 --> 00:17:03,412
  Effects of BOTOX® may spread  

424
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:04,913
 hours to weeks after injection 

425
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:05,948
   causing serious symptoms.    

426
00:17:07,418 --> 00:17:08,650
 Alert your doctor right away,  
   as difficulty swallowing,    

427
00:17:08,719 --> 00:17:10,486
      speaking, breathing,      
         eye problems,          

428
00:17:10,554 --> 00:17:11,787
       or muscle weakness       

429
00:17:11,856 --> 00:17:13,022
       can be signs of a        
  life-threatening condition.   

430
00:17:13,257 --> 00:17:15,224
        Side effects may        
  include allergic reactions,   

431
00:17:15,292 --> 00:17:18,027
 neck and injection site pain,  
     fatigue, and headache.     

432
00:17:18,095 --> 00:17:20,095
    Don't receive BOTOX® if     
   there's a skin infection.    

433
00:17:20,298 --> 00:17:22,264
     Tell your doctor your      
   medical history, muscle or   

434
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,866
       nerve conditions,        
        and medications,        

435
00:17:23,935 --> 00:17:25,334
  including botulinum toxins,   

436
00:17:25,403 --> 00:17:27,803
   as these may increase the    
 risk of serious side effects.

00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:01,671

       a noise violation        

450
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,707
   where there was loud music   
     coming from your house     

451
00:18:04,776 --> 00:18:06,142
    at 2:30 in the morning.     

452
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:07,343
            - Yeah.             

453
00:18:07,412 --> 00:18:08,444
         (Judge Caprio)         
  - Where you having a party?   

454
00:18:08,513 --> 00:18:09,512
  - Yeah, but this actually--   

455
00:18:09,581 --> 00:18:10,813
     - What kind of a party     
            was it?             

456
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:13,449
         - This wasn't          
       actually my house,       

457
00:18:13,518 --> 00:18:16,319

     it to me by accident.      

458
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:17,554
   They thought I lived there   

459
00:18:17,622 --> 00:18:19,489
         because it was         
       my friend's house,       

460
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:22,859
  and I was there at the party  
      with everybody else,      

461
00:18:22,928 --> 00:18:24,561
        but they assumed        
         I lived there,         

462
00:18:24,629 --> 00:18:26,563
   so they gave me the fine.    

463
00:18:26,631 --> 00:18:28,531
        The officer had         
          told me that          

464
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,101
        I could possibly        
  fight it or get it dismissed  

465
00:18:31,169 --> 00:18:33,270
   since I am not a resident    
         at the house.          

466
00:18:33,338 --> 00:18:34,371
     - So you were a guest.     

467
00:18:34,439 --> 00:18:35,972
            - Yeah.             

468
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,008
         - According to         
       the police report,       

469
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:39,142
    the police spoke to you     

470
00:18:39,211 --> 00:18:41,211
       and you said that        
        you were hosting        

471
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,546
    the welcome-back party.     

472
00:18:42,614 --> 00:18:43,547
         Is that right?         

473
00:18:43,615 --> 00:18:44,548
             - No.              

474
00:18:44,616 --> 00:18:46,783
        Actually, I was         
      co-hosting with him,      

475
00:18:46,852 --> 00:18:48,618
     so, yes, I was helping     

476
00:18:48,687 --> 00:18:50,821
        and I was, like,        
      a part of it, but--       

477
00:18:50,889 --> 00:18:53,991
  - So you were the organizer?  
     - No-- well, it was--      

478
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:54,992
     - You were hosting it,     
    you were the organizer.     

479
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,159
            - Yeah.             

480
00:18:56,228 --> 00:18:57,728
      But, I mean, I guess      
      I really was the one      

481
00:18:57,796 --> 00:18:59,363
    who took a fall for it.     

482
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:00,631
            - Yeah.             

483
00:19:00,699 --> 00:19:03,033
So, according to your admission,
       it was your party.       

484
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,136
      - I mean... I guess.      

485
00:19:06,205 --> 00:19:07,771
      - You just told me,       
       you co-hosted it.        

486
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,474
     - Yeah, but it wasn't      
           just mine.           

487
00:19:10,543 --> 00:19:12,409
          - Was, uh...          

488
00:19:12,478 --> 00:19:14,311
   Martin-- was Martin Severs   
             also--             

489
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,080
  - Yeah, he also got fined...  

490
00:19:16,148 --> 00:19:17,181
         (Judge Caprio)         
       - He got one too.        

491
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,749
       - ... but his was        
           dismissed.           

492
00:19:18,818 --> 00:19:19,783
     - Well, I'm not sure.      

493
00:19:19,852 --> 00:19:20,784
      I didn't dismiss it.      

494
00:19:20,853 --> 00:19:22,786
        - Yeah, I know,         
        I'm just saying.        

495
00:19:22,855 --> 00:19:24,221
  - Inspector Quinn, you wanna  
       be heard on this?        

496
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:26,557
         - Your Honor,          
      based on the, uh...       

497
00:19:26,626 --> 00:19:29,093
 the statements in the report,  
             um...              

498
00:19:29,162 --> 00:19:30,361
        - Well, she was         
     a little disingenuous      

499
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,463
   when she first-- when she    
        first came out.         

500
00:19:32,532 --> 00:19:34,098
  If you had just been honest   

501
00:19:34,167 --> 00:19:35,399
    when you first came out     
           and said--           

502
00:19:35,468 --> 00:19:38,202
       you know, you try        
 to pull the technical defense. 

503
00:19:38,271 --> 00:19:40,137
 "Well, I was at my apartment,  
      I don't live there."      

504
00:19:40,206 --> 00:19:41,439
             (Aga)              
             - No.              

505
00:19:41,507 --> 00:19:43,508
 - You could have easily said,  
    "I co-hosted the party,     

506
00:19:43,576 --> 00:19:45,309
     and I told the police      
 that and that's why I'm here." 

507
00:19:45,378 --> 00:19:46,844
     - I mean, I was just--     

508
00:19:46,913 --> 00:19:48,446
     - I know what you were     
         trying to do.          

509
00:19:48,515 --> 00:19:50,181
             (Aga)              
      - Trying to say what      
       they had told me,        

510
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,549
     'cause they said that.     

511
00:19:51,618 --> 00:19:53,051
          - I get it.           

512
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:54,185
        Inspector Quinn?        

513
00:19:54,254 --> 00:19:56,120
         - Your Honor,          
      based on the report,      

514
00:19:56,189 --> 00:19:57,255
        it would be $100        

515
00:19:57,324 --> 00:19:59,123
        or she can have         
            a trial.            

516
00:19:59,192 --> 00:20:00,858
       - You would've got       
   a much better disposition    

517
00:20:00,927 --> 00:20:02,393
     if you had been honest     
      from the beginning.       

518
00:20:02,462 --> 00:20:04,395
        Inspector Quinn         
     made a recommendation.     

519
00:20:04,464 --> 00:20:06,364
     $100 fine or come back     
       and have a trial.        

520
00:20:09,136 --> 00:20:10,268
         - I mean, I...         

521
00:20:10,337 --> 00:20:11,669
    - The matter's set down     
           for trial.           

522
00:20:14,808 --> 00:20:15,740
           Good luck.           

523
00:20:17,144 --> 00:20:20,312
    If you wanna be trusted,    
      you must be honest.       

524
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,480
         If Ms. Delgado         
  had simply told me the truth  

525
00:20:22,549 --> 00:20:24,449
  about her role in the party,  

526
00:20:24,518 --> 00:20:27,085
   I would have been inclined   
    to dismiss the charges.     

527
00:20:27,154 --> 00:20:28,920
  Thomas Jefferson once said,   

528
00:20:28,989 --> 00:20:32,057
 "Honesty is the first chapter  
    in the book of wisdom."     

529
00:20:32,126 --> 00:20:33,825
   It's also the best policy    

530
00:20:33,894 --> 00:20:35,827
      for every situation       
            in life.            

531
00:20:35,896 --> 00:20:38,730
         Including how          
  you behave in the courtroom.

533
00:20:42,236 --> 00:20:43,201
         Tony Acevedo.          

534
00:20:45,606 --> 00:20:48,474
         Tony, you have         
      three registrations.      

535
00:20:48,542 --> 00:20:49,975
             - Hmm?             

536
00:20:50,044 --> 00:20:51,610
         (Judge Caprio)         
      - Do you understand       
       what I just said?        

537
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:52,644
     - Three registrations?     

538
00:20:52,713 --> 00:20:53,679
             - Yes.             

539
00:20:53,748 --> 00:20:54,780
       Now, who's Maria--       

540
00:20:54,849 --> 00:20:55,781
      - That's my mother,       
              sir.              

541
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:56,782
         (Judge Caprio)         
         - Valenzuela.          

542
00:20:56,851 --> 00:20:57,783
     Are you here for her?      

543
00:20:57,852 --> 00:20:59,051
          - Yes, sir.           

544
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,920
      - All right, she has      
  an overnight parking ticket   

545
00:21:00,988 --> 00:21:02,821
          on Althea...          

546
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,924
          - Yes, sir.           

547
00:21:04,992 --> 00:21:06,559
    - There's a $40 penalty.    

548
00:21:06,627 --> 00:21:07,793
            I waived            
          the penalty.          

549
00:21:07,862 --> 00:21:08,828
          - Thank you.          

550
00:21:08,896 --> 00:21:09,962
         (Judge Caprio)         
    - So you just saved $40.    

551
00:21:10,031 --> 00:21:11,097
    You got the first ticket    
           dismissed.           

552
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,699
    Now comes the bad news.     

553
00:21:15,703 --> 00:21:17,136
          You have two          
     red-light violations.      

554
00:21:20,008 --> 00:21:22,041
         One goes back          
          to last year          

555
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:24,277
         and one is...          

556
00:21:24,345 --> 00:21:26,045
      just two weeks ago.       

557
00:21:27,849 --> 00:21:30,216
        This is a ticket        
    on North Main and Branch    

558
00:21:30,285 --> 00:21:31,717
    at 7:38 in the evening.     

559
00:21:33,188 --> 00:21:34,387
    What's the time on that?    

560
00:21:34,456 --> 00:21:35,655
             (man)              
       - .4, Your Honor.        

561
00:21:35,724 --> 00:21:36,656
         (Judge Caprio)         
          - All right.          

562
00:21:36,725 --> 00:21:38,324
       The next one is...       

563
00:21:38,393 --> 00:21:40,093
       on Pleasant Valley       
       and Valley Street.       

564
00:21:44,566 --> 00:21:45,632
       Is that him making       
       a right-hand turn?       

565
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,633
             (man)              
       - Yes, Your Honor.       

566
00:21:46,701 --> 00:21:48,268
     That's no turn on red      
            at all.             

567
00:21:48,336 --> 00:21:49,369
         (Judge Caprio)         
       - Was this during        

568
00:21:49,438 --> 00:21:51,070
  the period of construction?   

569
00:21:51,139 --> 00:21:52,338
             (man)              
       - Yes, Your Honor.       

570
00:21:52,407 --> 00:21:55,375
  - I'm gonna find-- I'm gonna  
      dismiss that ticket       

571
00:21:55,444 --> 00:21:57,243
where the signs were confusing, 

572

696
00:27:49,938 --> 00:27:52,171
     -Didn't you get caught     
   in the laminating machine?   

697
00:27:52,173 --> 00:27:53,773
         -Ha. [ Sighs ]

        was parked right        
       in front of a sign       

705
00:28:09,491 --> 00:28:11,124
      that says "tow zone,      
          no parking."          

706
00:28:11,193 --> 00:28:12,392
   - He didn't see the sign?    

707
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,860
         (Judge Caprio)         
   - He didn't see the sign?    

708
00:28:13,995 --> 00:28:15,962
 I'm gonna send him-- I'm gonna 
      send him for an exam      

709
00:28:16,031 --> 00:28:17,230
       to check his eyes.       

710
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:18,465
       The sign is right        
      in front of the car.      

711
00:28:18,533 --> 00:28:20,133
  According to the photograph   
            I have,             

712
00:28:20,202 --> 00:28:21,568
        he couldn't open        
      the door of his car       

713
00:28:21,636 --> 00:28:22,635
         unless he saw          
           the sign.            

714
00:28:22,704 --> 00:28:23,637
      (attendees laughing)      

715

             (man)              
       - Are you kidding?       

716
00:30:02,539 --> 00:30:03,705
         (Judge Caprio)         
     - Here's your vehicle,     
      here's your vehicle,      

717
00:30:03,774 --> 00:30:04,940
    here's vehicle and-- oh.    

718
00:30:05,008 --> 00:30:06,174
     Do you still think you     
      stopped long enough?      

719
00:30:06,243 --> 00:30:07,008
             - Yes.             

720
00:30:08,245 --> 00:30:09,477
           Maybe not.           

721
00:30:09,546 --> 00:30:10,579
         - Waive them.          

722
00:30:10,647 --> 00:30:12,214
   - Why should I waive this    
        for your nephew         

723
00:30:12,282 --> 00:30:13,248
          when you're           
       telling me that--        

724
00:30:13,317 --> 00:30:14,816
     - Because he's nowhere     
          to be found.          

725
00:30:14,885 --> 00:30:17,352
      - You're telling me       
  he's totally irresponsible.   

726
00:30:17,421 --> 00:30:19,621
  On behalf of all the people   
         of Providence,         

727
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:20,454
         thank you for          
      paying your summons.
