Let's be honest:                

2072
00:59:14,901 --> 00:59:16,067
you need insurance.             

2073
00:59:16,086 --> 00:59:18,253
But it's not really something   
you want to buy.                

2074
00:59:18,289 --> 00:59:20,289
         It's not sexy.         

2075
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:23,292
         Or delicious.          

2076
00:59:23,344 --> 00:59:24,843
            Or fun.             

2077
00:59:27,498 --> 00:59:30,248
  But since you need both car   
      and home insurance,       

2078
00:59:30,267 --> 00:59:33,685
   why not bundle them with     
  Esurance and save up to 10%?  

2079
00:59:33,721 --> 00:59:38,023
Which you can spend on things   
you really want to buy, like... 

2080
00:59:38,058 --> 00:59:39,224
    well, I don't know what     
        you'd wanna buy         

2081
00:59:39,259 --> 00:59:41,777
               because I'm just 
               a guy on your TV.

2082
00:59:41,812 --> 00:59:43,579
  Esurance. It's surprisingly   
           painless.
