469
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:28,024

470
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:30,327
WHAT I COULD FIND OUT,

471
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,661

473
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,831
WELL, I FOUND OUT THAT AROUND   
THE TURN OF THE LAST CENTURY,   

474
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,200
THE PROPERTY SEEMED TO

478
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:44,941
     WHAT SPECIFICALLY          
     DO YOU WANT ME TO FIND OUT?

479
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,443

CHANGE HANDS SO MANY TIMES      

483
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:53,016

       DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE
       FOR ME TO GO ON?

       JFK WAS ALSO FOND        
 OF QUOTING FROM ROBERT FROST   

1188
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:34,414
  AND EVEN HAD THE POET READ    
     AT HIS INAUGURATION.       

1189
00:52:34,483 --> 00:52:36,983
     IT'S RARE THAT POETRY      
       AND POLITICS MIX,        

1190
00:52:37,052 --> 00:52:40,187
     BUT SOMETIMES TRAGEDY      
   BRINGS THE TWO TOGETHER.     

1191
00:52:40,255 --> 00:52:42,289
    FOLLOWING THE DISASTER      
    THAT CLAIMED THE LIVES      

1192
00:52:42,357 --> 00:52:44,891
  OF SEVEN ASTRONAUTS ABOARD    
 THE SPACE SHUTTLE<i> CHALLENGER</i>   

1193
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:49,462
  ON JANUARY 28, 1986, RONALD   
 REAGAN ADDRESSED THE NATION.   

1194
00:52:49,531 --> 00:52:50,830
We will never forget them.      

1195
00:52:50,899 --> 00:52:53,066
   WHEN HE ENDED HIS REMARKS    
BY SAYING THE ASTRONAUTS HAD... 

1196
00:52:53,135 --> 00:52:57,704
Slipped the surly bonds of      
Earth to touch the face of God. 

1197
00:52:57,773 --> 00:53:00,173
       HE WAS BORROWING         
 FROM THE FIRST AND LAST LINE   

1198
00:53:00,242 --> 00:53:01,341
       OF "HIGH FLIGHT."        

1199
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:03,810
     THE POEM WAS WRITTEN       
            IN 1941             

1200
00:53:03,879 --> 00:53:05,812
    BY A 19-YEAR-OLD PILOT      
           OFFICER,             

1201
00:53:05,881 --> 00:53:07,881
  JOHN GILLESPIE MAGEE, JR.,    

1202
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:09,983
    ON THE BACK OF A LETTER     
         TO HIS MOTHER          

1203
00:53:10,052 --> 00:53:12,652
       JUST A FEW MONTHS        
     BEFORE HE WAS KILLED.      

1204
00:53:12,721 --> 00:53:15,055
 WHEN MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.,  
       WAS ASSASSINATED,        

1205
00:53:15,123 --> 00:53:17,757
    BOBBY KENNEDY WENT BACK     
          2,500 YEARS           

1206
00:53:17,826 --> 00:53:19,960
       TO THE GREEK POET        
           AESCHYLUS            

1207
00:53:20,028 --> 00:53:22,529
         TO GIVE VOICE          
  TO HIS HOPE FOR THE FUTURE.   

1208
00:53:22,598 --> 00:53:26,900
           Kennedy:             
      Even in our sleep,        
   pain which cannot forget     

1209
00:53:26,969 --> 00:53:31,004
      falls drop by drop        
        upon the heart          

1210
00:53:31,073 --> 00:53:35,075
   until in our own despair,    
       against our will,        

1211
00:53:35,143 --> 00:53:40,280
         comes wisdom           
through the awful grace of God.
