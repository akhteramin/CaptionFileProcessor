THAT SOME PEOPLE WERE SAYING    

135
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:13,011
THAT SOME PEOPLE WERE SAYING    
THAT MUELLER'S GUIDELINES WERE  

136
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:13,345
THAT MUELLER'S GUIDELINES WERE  
UNFAIR.                         

137
00:05:13,347 --> 00:05:15,947
UNFAIR.                         
THESE ARE NOT MUELLER'S

NOW THERE ARE WAYS THAT JUDGES  
CAN GO BELOW THAT, ONE WAY IS IF

157
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:49,948
CAN GO BELOW THAT, ONE WAY IS IF
SOMEBODY APOLOGIZES AND TAKES   

158
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,217
SOMEBODY APOLOGIZES AND TAKES   
RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT HE DID. 

159
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:54,319
RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT HE DID. 
THE JUDGE SAID HE DIDN'T DO     

160
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:54,619
THE JUDGE SAID HE DIDN'T DO     
THAT.                           

161
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:57,055
THAT.                           
ANOTHER WAY IS IF YOU PROVIDE

ANOTHER WAY IS IF YOU PROVIDE   
SUBSTANTIAL ASSISTANCE TO THE

PROSECUTORS.                    
MANAFORT DIDN'T DO THAT.        

165
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:01,760

171
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,136
WAY HE DID.                     
IT DOESN'T MAKE IT AN ILLEGAL   

172
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:12,738
IT DOESN'T MAKE IT AN ILLEGAL   
SENTENCE, BUT IT COULDN'T HAVE  

173
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,642
SENTENCE, BUT IT COULDN'T HAVE  
BEEN A MORE UNJUST SENTENCE.    

174

LIKE RUSSIAN COLLUSION HAS OR   

206
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:07,325
LIKE RUSSIAN COLLUSION HAS OR   
HASN'T BEEN PROVEN YET BECAUSE  

207
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:08,160
HASN'T BEEN PROVEN YET BECAUSE

AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE A WOMAN  
TO CLEAN UP THIS MESS AND SHE'S

A DECISION ABOUT 2020.          

406
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:54,148
   If you have postmenopausal   
   osteoporosis                 

407
00:13:54,184 --> 00:13:55,183
  and a high risk for fracture  

408
00:13:55,218 --> 00:13:57,435
 now might not be the best time 
 to ask yourself                

409
00:13:57,487 --> 00:14:00,188
      are my bones strong?      

410
00:14:00,223 --> 00:14:02,323
 Life is full of make-or-break  
 moments.                       

411
00:14:02,359 --> 00:14:03,441
  That's why it's so important  

412
00:14:03,493 --> 00:14:06,394
  to help reduce your risk of   
  fracture with Prolia®.        

413
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:08,863
 Only Prolia® is proven to help 
 strengthen                     

414
00:14:08,898 --> 00:14:13,701
and protect bones from fracture 
with 1 shot every 6 months.     

415
00:14:13,736 --> 00:14:16,404
Do not take Prolia® if you have 
low blood calcium, are pregnant,

416
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:18,456
  are allergic to it, or take   
  XGEVA®.                       

417
00:14:18,508 --> 00:14:19,874
  Serious allergic reactions,   

418
00:14:19,909 --> 00:14:21,676
like low blood pressure; trouble
breathing;                      

419
00:14:21,711 --> 00:14:23,461
throat tightness; face, lip, or 
tongue swelling;                

420
00:14:23,513 --> 00:14:25,880
  rash; itching; or hives have  
  happened.                     

421
00:14:25,915 --> 00:14:27,415
 Tell your doctor about dental  
 problems                       

422
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:29,300
as severe jaw bone problems may 
happen                          

423
00:14:29,352 --> 00:14:31,686
 or new or unusual pain in your 
 hip groin, or thigh,           

424
00:14:31,721 --> 00:14:33,972
as unusual thigh bone fractures 
have occurred.                  

425
00:14:34,024 --> 00:14:35,890
  Speak to your doctor before   
  stopping Prolia®              

426
00:14:35,925 --> 00:14:38,026
    as spine and other bone     
    fractures have occurred.    

427
00:14:38,061 --> 00:14:40,028
 Prolia® can cause serious side 
 effects,                       

428
00:14:40,063 --> 00:14:42,030
like low blood calcium, serious 
infections,                     

429
00:14:42,065 --> 00:14:44,649
which could need                
hospitalization, skin problems, 

430
00:14:44,701 --> 00:14:46,484
   and severe bone, joint, or   
   muscle pain.                 

431
00:14:46,536 --> 00:14:48,102
         Are you ready?         

432
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:53,474
Ask your doctor how Prolia® can 
help strengthen your bones.     
    With all that USAA offers   

433
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:54,642
    why go with anybody else?

00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:56,027

      their rates are good,     

435
00:14:56,112 --> 00:14:56,561

IS GIVING SOMEONE A RUN FOR     

721

THE PROBLEM FOR BERNIE MIGHT BE 

727
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:19,149
THE PROBLEM FOR BERNIE MIGHT BE 
A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD.           

728
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:21,919
A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD.

THEY HAVE A LOT OF OPTIONS, AND

THEY HAVE A LOT OF OPTIONS, AND 
THE QUESTION IS WHETHER HE HAS

806
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,015
  Guys do whatever it takes to  
  deal with shave irritation.   

807
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:51,435
So, we re-imagined the razor    
with the new Gillette SkinGuard.

808
00:27:52,872 --> 00:27:55,422
     It has a unique guard      
     between the blades.        

809
00:27:55,441 --> 00:27:58,892
  That's designed to reduce     
  irritation during the shave.  

810
00:28:00,062 --> 00:28:04,064
 Because we believe all men     
 deserve a razor just for them. 

811
00:28:06,452 --> 00:28:08,452
    The best a man can get.     

812
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:11,238
           Gillette.            

813
00:29:13,034 --> 00:29:14,868
     I've always been amazed    
         by what's next.        

814
00:29:15,137 --> 00:29:16,553
  And still going for my best,  

815
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:18,088
     even though I live with    
     a higher risk of stroke    

816
00:29:18,474 --> 00:29:21,208
    due to Afib not caused by   
     a heart valve problem.     

817
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,343
So if there's a better treatment
        than warfarin...        

818
00:29:23,562 --> 00:29:24,711
        I want that too.        

819
00:29:24,897 --> 00:29:25,979
            ELIQUIS.            

820
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:27,097
        ELIQUIS is proven       

821
00:29:27,483 --> 00:29:29,349
      to reduce stroke risk     
      better than warfarin.     

822
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:31,101
   Plus has significantly less  

823
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:32,719
  major bleeding than warfarin. 

824
00:29:33,022 --> 00:29:35,555
     ELIQUIS is FDA-approved    
          and has both.         

825
00:29:35,741 --> 00:29:36,723
          What's next?          

826
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:38,158
     Reeling in a nice one.     

827
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:40,661
   <i> Don't stop taking ELIQUIS</i>   
<i>unless your doctor tells you to,</i>

828
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:43,080
<i>as stopping increases your risk</i> 
      <i> of having a stroke.</i>      

829
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:46,183
 <i> ELIQUIS can cause serious and</i> 
 <i> in rare cases fatal bleeding.</i> 

830
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:48,502
 <i> Don't take ELIQUIS If you have</i>
   <i> an artificial heart valve</i>   

831
00:29:48,754 --> 00:29:50,120
     <i> or abnormal bleeding.</i>     

832
00:29:50,506 --> 00:29:52,539
     <i> While taking ELIQUIS,</i>     
   <i> you may bruise more easily</i>  

833
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,359
  <i> and it may take longer than</i>  
<i>usual for any bleeding to stop.</i>

  That's why it's so important  

1467
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:32,831
  to help reduce your risk of   
  fracture with Prolia®.

with 1 shot every 6 months.     

1470
00:57:40,174 --> 00:57:42,841
Do not take Prolia® if you have 
low blood calcium, are pregnant,

1471
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:44,893
  are allergic to it, or take

1476
00:57:52,352 --> 00:57:53,852
 Tell your doctor about dental  
 problems                       

1477
00:57:53,871 --> 00:57:55,737

have occurred.                  

1480
00:58:00,461 --> 00:58:02,327
  Speak to your doctor before   
  stopping Prolia®              

1481
00:58:02,362 --> 00:58:04,463

 Prolia® can cause serious side 
 effects,                       

1483
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:08,467

1484
00:58:08,502 --> 00:58:11,086

hospitalization, skin problems,
