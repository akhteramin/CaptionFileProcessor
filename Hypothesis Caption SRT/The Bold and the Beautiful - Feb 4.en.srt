She's just so tiny. So innocent.

   type 2 diabetes with food,   

163
00:05:27,143 --> 00:05:29,093
       family and FARXIGA,      

164
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:30,895
 the pill that starts with "f." 

165
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:32,647
       FARXIGA, along with      
       diet and exercise,       

166
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:35,733
    helps lower A1C in adults   
      with type 2 diabetes.     

167
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:36,651
      It's one pill a day.      

168
00:05:36,653 --> 00:05:38,403
     And although it's not a    
        weight-loss drug,       

169
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:40,071
  it may help you lose weight.  

170

         Do not take if         
      allergic to FARXIGA.      

171
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,558
   If you experience symptoms   
 of a serious allergic reaction 

172
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,743
     such as rash, swelling,

      difficulty breathing      
         or swallowing,         

174
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,614
      stop taking and seek      
    medical help right away.    

175
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:52,250
   Do not take FARXIGA if you   
  have severe kidney problems,

      have bladder cancer.      

177
00:05:54,371 --> 00:05:56,070
     Tell your doctor right     
     away if you have blood     

178
00:05:56,072 --> 00:05:57,571
   or red color in your urine   

179
00:05:57,573 --> 00:05:59,240
   or pain while you urinate.   

180
00:05:59,242 --> 00:06:02,126
 FARXIGA can cause serious side 
 effects including dehydration, 

181
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:03,928
    genital yeast infections    
       in women and men,        

182
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,713
         serious urinary        
        tract infections,       

183
00:06:05,715 --> 00:06:07,548

00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:15,516
for her to -- to --

00:07:23,493 --> 00:07:24,625
quickly.                        
So, you said this was through a 
connection of yours?

re-shuffling.
