1043
00:36:22,731 --> 00:36:25,815
    the clock is ticking on     
   irreversible joint damage.   

1044
00:36:25,868 --> 00:36:27,450
   Ongoing pain and stiffness   

1045

  are signs of joint erosion.   

1046
00:36:29,538 --> 00:36:31,788
HUMIRA can help stop the clock.

    Prescribed for 15 years,    

1048
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:35,792
  HUMIRA targets and blocks a   
     source of inflammation     

1049
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:39,496
 that contributes to joint pain 
    and irreversible damage.    

1050
00:36:39,548 --> 00:36:42,082
     HUMIRA can lower your
