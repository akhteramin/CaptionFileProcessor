AND LET ME TELL YOU AT LEAST A  

350
00:11:57,888 --> 00:12:00,855
AND LET ME TELL YOU AT LEAST A  
COUPLE OF REASONS WHY.          

351
00:12:00,857 --> 00:12:03,758
COUPLE OF REASONS WHY.          
THE FIRST ONE IS, IT'S JUST A   

352
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,926
THE FIRST ONE IS, IT'S JUST A   
PLAIN OLD SCIENCE REASON.       

353
00:12:04,928 --> 00:12:06,127
PLAIN OLD SCIENCE REASON.       
IT MAKES NO DARN SENSE THAT     

354
00:12:06,129 --> 00:12:08,963
IT MAKES NO DARN SENSE THAT     
RIGHT NOW IN AMERICA WE TREAT   

355
00:12:08,965 --> 00:12:13,201
RIGHT NOW IN AMERICA WE TREAT   
MARIJUANA AS A SCHEDULE 1 DRUG, 

356
00:12:13,203 --> 00:12:14,536
MARIJUANA AS A SCHEDULE 1 DRUG, 
WHICH MEANS IN EFFECT THE       

357
00:12:14,538 --> 00:12:15,403
WHICH MEANS IN EFFECT THE       
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS          

358
00:12:15,405 --> 00:12:16,738
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS          
DETERMINED IN ADVANCE THAT IT   

359
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,607
DETERMINED IN ADVANCE THAT IT   
HAS NO MEDICINAL USE, THAT IT   

360
00:12:19,609 --> 00:12:21,943
HAS NO MEDICINAL USE, THAT IT   
CAN'T HAVE ANY GOOD EFFECTS, NO 

361
00:12:21,945 --> 00:12:24,512
CAN'T HAVE ANY GOOD EFFECTS, NO 
RESEARCH IS SUPPOSED TO BE DONE.

362
00:12:24,514 --> 00:12:26,314
RESEARCH IS SUPPOSED TO BE DONE.
IT MAKES IT VERY HARD TO DO     

363
00:12:26,316 --> 00:12:27,282
IT MAKES IT VERY HARD TO DO     
RESEARCH ON IT AND THAT'S       

364
00:12:27,284 --> 00:12:28,850
RESEARCH ON IT AND THAT'S       
JUST -- WE SHOULD BE DOING THIS,

365
00:12:28,852 --> 00:12:29,083
JUST -- WE SHOULD BE DOING THIS,
RIGHT?                          

366
00:12:29,085 --> 00:12:30,585
RIGHT?                          
WE SHOULD BE LOOKING INTO IT.   

367
00:12:30,587 --> 00:12:33,288
WE SHOULD BE LOOKING INTO IT.   
BUT THE SECOND REASON IS BECAUSE

368
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:36,224
BUT THE SECOND REASON IS BECAUSE
OF THE RACIAL IMPACT OF THE     

369
00:12:36,226 --> 00:12:37,559
OF THE RACIAL IMPACT OF THE     
ENFORCEMENT OF MARIJUANA LAWS.  

370
00:12:37,561 --> 00:12:39,494
ENFORCEMENT OF MARIJUANA LAWS.  
YOU KNOW, RIGHT NOW IN THIS     

371
00:12:39,496 --> 00:12:41,329
YOU KNOW, RIGHT NOW IN THIS     
COUNTRY THE BEST EVIDENCE       

372
00:12:41,331 --> 00:12:43,031
COUNTRY THE BEST EVIDENCE       
SUGGESTS THAT AFRICAN-AMERICANS 

373
00:12:43,033 --> 00:12:46,701
SUGGESTS THAT AFRICAN-AMERICANS 
AND WHITES USE MARIJUANA AT     

374
00:12:46,703 --> 00:12:50,105
AND WHITES USE MARIJUANA AT     
ABOUT THE SAME RATES AND YET    

375
00:12:50,107 --> 00:12:51,106
ABOUT THE SAME RATES AND YET    
AFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE FAR MORE  

376
00:12:51,108 --> 00:12:53,742
AFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE FAR MORE  
LIKELY TO BE ARRESTED FOR       

377
00:12:53,744 --> 00:12:55,677
LIKELY TO BE ARRESTED FOR       
MARIJUANA USE THAN WHITES ARE.  

378
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,746
MARIJUANA USE THAN WHITES ARE.

I'M STUDYING FAMILIES THAT GO   

962
00:35:41,666 --> 00:35:45,802
I'M STUDYING FAMILIES THAT GO   
BANKRUPT, AND THE CREDIT CARD

IMPROVE THEIR BOTTOM LINE BY    

969
00:35:56,348 --> 00:35:58,214
IMPROVE THEIR BOTTOM LINE BY    
JUST A LITTLE BY KEEPING PEOPLE 

970
00:35:58,216 --> 00:36:00,049
JUST A LITTLE BY KEEPING PEOPLE 
LOCKED OUT OF BANKRUPTCY.       

971
00:36:00,051 --> 00:36:03,052
LOCKED OUT OF BANKRUPTCY.       
NEVER MIND THAT THERE'S PEOPLE  

972
00:36:03,054 --> 00:36:06,489
NEVER MIND THAT THERE'S PEOPLE  
THAT ARE HEAD OVER HEELS IN     

973
00:36:06,491 --> 00:36:11,127
THAT ARE HEAD OVER HEELS IN     
MEDICAL DEBTS, THAT THEY'VE HAD 

974
00:36:11,129 --> 00:36:13,396
MEDICAL DEBTS, THAT THEY'VE HAD 
JOB LOSSES OR A DEATH OR        

975
00:36:13,398 --> 00:36:15,865
JOB LOSSES OR A DEATH OR        
IN THE FAMILY BUT THEY'VE BEEN  

976
00:36:15,867 --> 00:36:17,333
IN THE FAMILY BUT THEY'VE BEEN  
CHEATED BY CREDIT CARD COMPANIES

977
00:36:17,335 --> 00:36:18,902
CHEATED BY CREDIT CARD COMPANIES
AND MORTGAGE COMPANIES.         

978
00:36:18,904 --> 00:36:21,437
AND MORTGAGE COMPANIES.         
NEVER MIND ANY OF THAT.         

979
00:36:21,439 --> 00:36:22,839
NEVER MIND ANY OF THAT.         
I LOOKED AROUND THE MIDDLE OF   

980
00:36:22,841 --> 00:36:24,574
I LOOKED AROUND THE MIDDLE OF   
THAT FIGHT AND I REALIZED ALL   

981
00:36:24,576 --> 00:36:26,042
THAT FIGHT AND I REALIZED ALL   
THE MONEY WAS ON ONE SIDE AND   

982
00:36:26,044 --> 00:36:28,011
THE MONEY WAS ON ONE SIDE AND   
ALL THE HURTING WAS ON THE OTHER

983
00:36:28,013 --> 00:36:33,716
ALL THE HURTING WAS ON THE OTHER
AND THAT'S WHEN I JUMPED IN     

984
00:36:33,718 --> 00:36:34,017
AND THAT'S WHEN I JUMPED IN     
POLITICALLY.                    

985
00:36:34,019 --> 00:36:36,920
POLITICALLY.                    
I GOT IN THAT FIGHT AND I FOUGHT

986
00:36:36,922 --> 00:36:37,587
I GOT IN THAT FIGHT AND I FOUGHT
IT FOR TEN YEARS, AND BY THE END

987
00:36:37,589 --> 00:36:39,456
IT FOR TEN YEARS, AND BY THE END
OF THAT FIGHT I FULLY UNDERSTOOD

988
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:41,925
OF THAT FIGHT I FULLY UNDERSTOOD
THAT EVERY SINGLE REPUBLICAN    

989
00:36:41,927 --> 00:36:43,359
THAT EVERY SINGLE REPUBLICAN    
STOOD THERE FOR THE BANKS AND   

990
00:36:43,361 --> 00:36:45,962
STOOD THERE FOR THE BANKS AND   
HALF OF THE DEMOCRATS DID.      

991
00:36:45,964 --> 00:36:47,464
HALF OF THE DEMOCRATS DID.      
SO MY PARTY WAS THE PARTY THAT  

992
00:36:47,466 --> 00:36:49,532
SO MY PARTY WAS THE PARTY THAT  
AT LEAST WE GOT HALF OF THEM TO 

993
00:36:49,534 --> 00:36:51,534
AT LEAST WE GOT HALF OF THEM TO 
STAND UP FOR WORKING PEOPLE, AND

994
00:36:51,536 --> 00:36:55,005
STAND UP FOR WORKING PEOPLE, AND
THAT WAS THE BIG CHANGE FOR ME. 

995
00:36:55,007 --> 00:36:55,305
THAT WAS THE BIG CHANGE FOR ME.
