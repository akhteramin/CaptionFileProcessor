00:15:44,332 --> 00:15:46,932

A FACTOR IN THE DECISION MAKING 

591
00:15:46,934 --> 00:15:47,299
A FACTOR IN THE DECISION MAKING 
GOING FORWARD.                  

592
00:15:47,301 --> 00:15:49,001
GOING FORWARD.                  
I THINK ONE FACTOR THAT WE ALSO

I THINK ONE FACTOR THAT WE ALSO 
HAVE TO CONSIDER IS THAT IN 18

FOR TWO REASONS.                

653
00:17:34,642 --> 00:17:36,042
FOR TWO REASONS.                
ONE, WE KNOW THAT UNDER OUR

1337
00:43:51,474 --> 00:43:53,108
       -We bought a house       
        in a neighborhood       

1338
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:54,242
       with a lot of other      
         young couples.         

1339
00:43:54,244 --> 00:43:56,578
         Then we noticed        
      something...strange.      

1340
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:57,946
       Oh, could you, uh,       
        make me a burger?       

1341
00:43:57,948 --> 00:43:59,648
    -Poof -- you're a burger.   

1342
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:01,450
          [ Laughter ]          

1343
00:44:01,452 --> 00:44:03,085
       -Everyone acts like      
         their parents.         

1344
00:44:03,087 --> 00:44:04,419
       -You have a tattoo.      
              -Yes.             

1345
00:44:04,421 --> 00:44:06,254
     -Fun. Do you not work?     

1346
00:44:06,256 --> 00:44:07,489
     -So, what kind of mower    
         you got, Seth?         

1347
00:44:07,491 --> 00:44:09,291
         -I don't know.         
      Some kid comes over.      

1348
00:44:09,293 --> 00:44:12,060
      We pay him to do it.      

1349
00:44:12,062 --> 00:44:13,295
     -But it's not all bad.     

1350
00:44:13,297 --> 00:44:15,197
     Someone even showed us     
      how we can save money     

1351
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:17,165
    by bundling home and auto   
        with Progressive.       

1352
00:44:17,167 --> 00:44:19,301
 <i> Progressive can't protect you</i> 
  <i> from becoming your parents.</i>  

1353
00:44:19,303 --> 00:44:20,702
       <i> But we can protect</i>      
      <i> your home and auto.</i>      

1354
00:44:22,305 --> 00:44:26,975
Wow, before I refinanced I paid 
so much on my grad school loans.

1355
00:44:27,011 --> 00:44:28,543
 <i> Progressive can't protect you</i> 
  <i> from becoming your parents.</i>  
So insane!                      

1356
00:44:28,579 --> 00:44:32,881
Speaking of insane, have I not  
taken a vacation in 4 years?    

1357
00:44:32,917 --> 00:44:36,151
I should probably do that, and  
get a new car.                  

1358
00:44:36,186 --> 00:44:39,855
How about a road trip?          
Or Tokyo?                       

1359
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:42,457
Well I've got to celebrate,     
because now I'm going to be     

1360
00:44:42,493 --> 00:44:44,326
debt-free even sooner.          

1361
00:44:44,361 --> 00:44:46,328
And this is why I SoFi.         

1362
00:44:46,397 --> 00:44:47,930
When you refinance your student 

1363
00:44:47,965 --> 00:44:49,464
loans with SoFi, you can save   

1364
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,732
thousands.                      

1365
00:44:51,467 --> 00:44:52,734
       A migraine hope...       

1366
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:54,303
         from Aimovig.          

1367
00:44:54,338 --> 00:44:57,239
  To be there for the good...   

1368
00:44:57,274 --> 00:45:00,175
        and not so good.        

1369
00:45:00,211 --> 00:45:02,511
        For the mundane.        

1370
00:45:02,546 --> 00:45:05,113
       The awe-inspiring.       

1371
00:45:05,149 --> 00:45:07,282
       The heart-racing.        

1372
00:45:07,351 --> 00:45:09,151
       The heartbreaking.       

1373
00:45:09,186 --> 00:45:11,019
That's what life is all about...

1374
00:45:11,055 --> 00:45:12,588
          showing up.           

1375
00:45:12,623 --> 00:45:16,058
  Unless migraine steals your   
        chance to say...        

1376
00:45:16,093 --> 00:45:18,427
          "I am here."          

1377
00:45:18,462 --> 00:45:20,129
     We aim to change that.     

1378
00:45:20,164 --> 00:45:21,663
    That's why we created...    

1379
00:45:21,699 --> 00:45:22,898
            Aimovig.            

1380
00:45:22,933 --> 00:45:25,000
   A preventive treatment for   
      migraine in adults.       

1381
00:45:25,035 --> 00:45:26,435
           One dose.            

1382
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:27,703
         Once a month.          

1383
00:45:27,738 --> 00:45:30,773
Aimovig is proven to reduce the 
number of monthly migraine days.

1384
00:45:30,841 --> 00:45:33,742
For some, that number can be cut
        in half or more.        

1385
00:45:33,778 --> 00:45:35,611
  The most common side effects  
           are pain,            

1386
00:45:35,646 --> 00:45:38,647
   redness or swelling at the   
injection site and constipation.

1387
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:41,483
       It doesn't matter        
     what each day brings.      

1388
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:43,285
   So long as you can say...    

1389
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,187
          "I am here."          

1390
00:45:45,222 --> 00:45:47,222
     Aim to be there more.      

1391
00:45:47,258 --> 00:45:48,424
      Talk to your doctor       

1392
