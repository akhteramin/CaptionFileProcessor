AND SO IS IT JUST A BOUNCE

I THINK ULTIMATELY WE STILL HAVE

00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:10,408
I THINK ULTIMATELY WE STILL HAVE
A LOT OF RISK TO THE DOWNSIDE   

360
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,877
A LOT OF RISK TO THE DOWNSIDE   
AND AT A MINIMUM WE'RE LIKELY TO

361
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,713
AND AT A MINIMUM WE'RE LIKELY TO
FIND A REFERENCE POINT AS WE

00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:16,514
FIND A REFERENCE POINT AS WE    
FOUND BEFORE HERE, JUST AS WE

FOUND BEFORE HERE, JUST AS WE   
HAD REFERENCE POINTS AT THE HIGH

00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:19,150
HAD REFERENCE POINTS AT THE HIGH
AT 2800.

00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:21,152
AT 2800.                        
AND THAT A NORMAL CHECK BACK IS 

366
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:22,988
AND THAT A NORMAL CHECK BACK IS 
NOT GOING TO BE 3% AFTER        

367
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,856
NOT GOING TO BE 3% AFTER

TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS CHANNEL.

TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS CHANNEL.  
AND I THINK THAT ULTIMATELY IS

AND I THINK THAT ULTIMATELY IS  
WHAT HAS TO BE CONSIDERED BEFORE

00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:34,966
WHAT HAS TO BE CONSIDERED BEFORE

I KNOW THERE'S ALWAYS A SHOT, SO

386
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,353
I KNOW THERE'S ALWAYS A SHOT, SO
HOW CREDIBLE IS ANOTHER SHOT

HOW CREDIBLE IS ANOTHER SHOT    
DOWN TO 2350

THE REAL QUESTION IS DO WE --   
NOW, IT'S IMPORTANT, PEOPLE USE

NOW, IT'S IMPORTANT, PEOPLE USE 
THE WORD "RETEST."              

394
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,399
THE WORD "RETEST."              
IT WOULD BE A TEST              

395
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:10,101
IT WOULD BE A TEST              
IF YOU HAVE A LOW AND YOU GO
