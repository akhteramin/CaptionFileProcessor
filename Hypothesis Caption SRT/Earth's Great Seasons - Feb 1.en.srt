00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:19,585
           [narrator]           
 Every year, spectacular seasons

2
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,987
      transform our planet.     

3
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:26,592
    They're the driving force   
      of all life on Earth.     

4
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:30,829
    Bringing opportunities...   

5
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:34,066
      and huge challenges.      

6
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,637
  Spring bursts with new life.  

7
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:40,406
           [chirping]           

8
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:43,175
     But it's a race to grab    
        fleeting chances.       

9
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:48,447
       Summer is all about      
       glorious abundance.      

10
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:51,784
  But the heat can push animals 
        to their limits.        

11
00:00:52,987 --> 00:00:56,421
       Autumn is nature's       
        great gold rush.        

12
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,427
   But competition is fierce.   

13
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:08,033
         Winter creates         
      a frozen wonderland.      

14
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,573
  And only the most resourceful 
          will survive.         

15
00:01:20,848 --> 00:01:23,148
         In every corner        
          of the planet,        

16
00:01:23,184 --> 00:01:26,451
    animals rise to overcome    
   the seemingly impossible...  

17
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:30,189
and use extraordinary tricks... 

18
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,625
   to thrive against the odds   

19
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:36,395
      as the seasons create     

20
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,564
  the greatest shows on Earth.  

21
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:51,443
             Winter.            

22
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:53,712
  The sun's power is weakening. 

23
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:57,549
       It's getting colder      
           and darker.          

24
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,187
        The land is going       
    into suspended animation.   

25
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,091
     In this magical world,     

26
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,194
        animals are faced       
   with formidable challenges.  

27
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,531
 And when temperatures plummet, 

28
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:16,401
    the first big challenge     
    is keeping out the cold.    

29
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,814
       This extreme season      
   needs inventive solutions.   

30
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,284
  In the highlands of Scotland  

31
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,853
     a ptarmigan has to cope    
        with temperatures       

32
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:38,290
  approaching minus 30 degrees  
           centigrade.          

33
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:41,727
    So it grows more feathers   
      to keep the heat in.      

34
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:44,796
      It even has feathers      
         on its feet...         

35
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:47,099
        and its eyelids.        

36
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:57,509
        In North America,       
      a red fox keeps warm      

37
00:02:57,544 --> 00:03:01,113
     by wrapping himself up     
    in his extra-thick tail.    

38
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:09,821
        Arctic foxes grow       
    one of the thickest coats   

39
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:12,190
     in the animal kingdom.     

40
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:19,865
  Her tiny ears and stubby legs 
        reduce heat loss.       

41
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,702
  And even the pads of her feet 
     have a covering of fur.    

42
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:29,574
       Even when it drops       
     to minus 70 centigrade,    

43
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,077
    she's quite comfortable.    

44
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:38,250
        But other animals       
    have more inventive ways    

45
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:39,918
     to stave off the cold.     

46
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,790
 Finland, on the arctic circle. 

47
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:48,493
   Temperatures here can fall   
 to minus 45 degrees centigrade.

48
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,963
      The snow is so heavy      

49
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:54,499
           it can bend          
     the sturdiest of trees.    

50
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:01,573
      But among the drifts      

51
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:04,075
    lives one of the world's    
       smallest predators,      

52
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:07,712
    with a ruthless approach    
        to keeping warm.        

53
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,490
         A least weasel.        

54
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:21,893
           She's tiny,          
   barely 20 centimeters long.  

55
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:24,896
  She's grown a new white coat  
           for winter.          

56
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:31,002
  It keeps her almost invisible 
          in the snow.          

57
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:35,173
        Great for hiding        
        from predators,         

58
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:38,610
    but it's not thick enough   
  to protect her from the cold. 

59
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,081
  Even shivering can't generate 
          enough heat.          

60
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:49,254
    But this ingenious weasel   
           has a plan.          

61
00:04:58,098 --> 00:05:00,966
      She starts by diving      
         under the snow.        

62
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:08,206
    Snow is 95% trapped air,    

63
00:05:08,242 --> 00:05:11,543
     so it keeps the heat in    
       like a giant duvet.      

64
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,220
        There's a network       
           of tunnels.          

65
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:25,523
      But they're not hers.     

66
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:29,194
      They belong to voles.     

67
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:36,067
     Voles spend the winter     
     in their snow tunnels,     

68
00:05:36,103 --> 00:05:38,136
        where they think        
          they're safe.         

69
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:45,710
      But with her skinny,      
         flexible body,         

70
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:48,813
      the weasel can easily     
       navigate the maze.       

71
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,520
         There's nowhere        
       for a vole to hide.      

72
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,736
            Spotted.            

73
00:06:29,423 --> 00:06:31,823
        The vole is fast.       

74
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:36,828
    But the weasel is faster.   

75
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:42,901
    But there's more to this    
        than just a meal.       

76
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,105
    Once the weasel has eaten   
        the hapless vole,       

77
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,574
         she delicately         
        plucks its hair.        

78
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,381
       Then she weaves it       
         into her nest,         

79
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,017
        building herself        
        a furry cocoon.         

80
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:03,188
      Bed and breakfast...      

81
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,692
   in one convenient package.   

82
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:22,707
Many animals must rely on their 
wits to survive the bitter cold.

83
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,313
         In the mountains       
        of central Japan,       

84
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:30,181
    winters can be brutal...    

85
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:35,487
    with some of the deepest    
   falls of snow in the world.  

86
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:39,991
 But there's a surprising animal
    eking out a living here.    

87
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:44,395
            A monkey.           

88
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,165
       Aside from people,       

89
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,001
     these Japanese macaques    
       live further north       

90
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:52,871
     than any other primate     
            on Earth.           

91
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,341
        Their coats are         
        unusually thick,        

92
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:59,077
      to protect them from      
   the freezing temperatures.   

93
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,249
 Even when it's minus 20 degrees
           centigrade,          

94
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:06,651
  a mom and her baby can cope.  

95
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:15,593
  But as the temperatures fall, 

96
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:18,963
    the monkeys need to find    
  extra calories to stay warm.  

97
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:25,536
 These are some of the cleverest
     monkeys on the planet.     

98
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:27,572
   And they're so resourceful,  

99
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:32,477
    they'll never go hungry,    
   no matter how cold it gets.  

100
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:38,049
  They can eat almost anything. 

101
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:41,653
    And at this time of year,   
     nothing goes to waste.     

102
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,858
        As a last resort,       
  when all other food is gone,  

103
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:49,827
        they'll even eat        
       the bark of trees.       

104
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,530
         This is smarter        
          than it seems.        

105
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:55,967
  Just beneath the woody layer  
         is the sapwood,        

106
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:59,804
      where the tree stores     
     its precious nutrients.    

107
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,874
    It gives them just enough   
  calories to keep them going.  

108
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:14,152
         But this is not        
     their only clever trick    

109
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:16,020
   to get them through winter.  

110
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,423
         There's warmth         
        to be found here.       

111
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:24,095
         Japan is a land        
          of volcanoes.         

112
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:31,035
        Below the ground,       
     this volcanic activity     

113
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,971
        brings hot water        
    bubbling to the surface.    

114
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:38,409
  Even in the depths of winter. 

115
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:40,078
     It's a thermal spring.     

116
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:42,613
   And these ingenious monkeys  
          have learned          

117
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,549
   how to make the most of it.  

118
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:51,055
     Snow moneys have become    
          spa monkeys.          

119
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:56,427
         In their bath,         

120
00:09:56,463 --> 00:10:00,298
  it's a comfortable 41 degrees 
           centigrade.          

121
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:04,202
    With constant warm water    
           to bask in,          

122
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:08,172
    these monkeys live a life   
           of leisure.          

123
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:19,183
 And the youngsters have plenty 
        of time to play.        

124
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,100
        Thanks to their         
        resourcefulness,        

125
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,636
      these clever monkeys      
          will survive,         

126
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:41,639
      no matter what winter     
         throws at them.        

127
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,157
        But when it comes       
      to fighting the cold,     

128
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:02,827
  this is the most challenging  
          place of all.         

129
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,097
           Antarctica.          

130
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:10,234
   The coldest place on Earth.  

131
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:17,842
    Temperatures can plummet    
 to minus 94 degrees centigrade.

132
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:23,814
You have to be a true specialist
    to survive a winter here.   

133
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,954
        Emperor penguins.       

134
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,656
      At over a meter tall,     

135
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,191
  they're the largest penguins  
          in the world.         

136
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:40,898
    They've been out at sea,    
            fishing,            

137
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:44,201
 building up an insulating layer
             of fat             

138
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:46,404
nearly three centimeters thick. 

139
00:11:55,381 --> 00:12:00,918
  And now they're about to face 
  the toughest winter on Earth. 

140
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:11,329
  Because penguins take so long 
     to raise their chicks,     

141
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:13,731
     they must start early.     

142
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:19,937
         And that means         
      incubating their eggs     

143
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:22,974
      through the planet's      
         deepest winter.        

144
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:26,811
         When she's laid        
         her single egg,        

145
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:29,580
     the female must return     
       to the sea to feed.      

146
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:34,952
   So it's over to the father   
         to incubate it.        

147
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:38,356
       All through winter.      

148
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:44,362
         He protects it         
   in a little pocket of skin   

149
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:46,364
      just above his feet.      

150
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:52,570
He's now responsible for keeping
        it safe and warm,       

151
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,806
     for nearly four months.    

152
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:59,076
   Just as the world's coldest  
     weather is closing in.     

153
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:05,082
      Antarctica is entering    
     six months of darkness.    

154
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:08,753
    Winter here is merciless.   

155
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:09,920
         [wind gusting]         

156
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:13,190
        The winds can top       
     190 kilometers an hour.    

157
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:22,466
     These are the darkest,     
            coldest,            

158
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:26,270
       windiest conditions      
 faced by any creature on Earth.

159
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:32,877
       But through it all,      

160
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:35,412
     the emperor penguin dad    
           battles on.          

161
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:38,649
      He's still incubating     
       his precious egg...      

162
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:44,655
      perched on his feet,      
      just above the ice.       

163
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,458
  He and all the other fathers  
  have found an inventive way   

164
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,928
       to make it through       
   when times get really bad.   

165
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:08,078
       They come together       
 for the world's biggest huddle.

166
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,994
         [wind gusting]         

167
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,700
  Penguins don't normally enjoy 
        being this close.       

168
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,937
    But they have no choice.    

169
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,777
By crowding together as a team, 

170
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:43,080
          they can cut          
       heat loss by half.       

171
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:46,584
   After his stint on the edge  
          of the flock,         

172
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:50,821
  each penguin patiently queues 
   for his turn on the inside.  

173
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:54,158
  It's recently been discovered 
        that their huddle       

174
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:55,960
        is so effective,        

175
00:14:55,995 --> 00:15:00,598
  the heat inside can build up  
to around 40 degrees centigrade.

176
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,800
          That's nearly         
        80 degrees warmer       

177
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:05,536
      than the temperature      
         on the outside.        

178
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,171
     So every now and then,     

179
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:10,908
    they must break formation   
          to cool down.         

180
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:18,749
  Throughout the male penguin's 
    four-month tour of duty,    

181
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:22,119
    the sun never rises once.   

182
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,626
     But just occasionally,     

183
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,095
        there's a glimmer       
         in the darkness.       

184
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:37,167
        Charged particles       
          from the sun          

185
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:39,737
    crash into the atmosphere   
     above the South Pole...    

186
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:48,345
    and blaze across the sky.   

187
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,115
    It's the southern lights.   

188
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,586
       The penguins barely      
         seem to notice.        

189
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:59,990
     But in a brutal season,    
     it's a moment of magic.    

190
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:09,066
  Winter is full of spectacle.  

191
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:12,236
   When the temperature drops   
   below minus six centigrade,  

192
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:16,440
     water vapor in the air     
     turns directly to ice.     

193
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,942
   These microscopic crystals   

194
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,979
      attract more and more     
         water droplets.        

195
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:26,116
          And they grow         
        into snowflakes.        

196
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:34,925
  In just one second, a million 
 billion are made by the clouds.

197
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,595
  In 10 minutes, that's enough  
 snow for everyone on the planet

198
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:41,632
   to build their own snowman.  

199
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,870
       Each flake is tiny,      

200
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:50,340
  but together they can blanket 
         the landscape,         

201
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:53,243
         turning it into        
          a wonderland.         

202
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,620
         It's a complete        
         transformation.        

203
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:07,157
      And even the animals      
   seem to enjoy the novelty.   

204
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:10,828
     [snarling and growling]    

205
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:41,225
          But for some,         
       there's a problem.       

206
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:46,096
     A thick blanket of snow    
      will hide their food.     

207
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:54,171
   So if they're going to find  
        anything to eat,        

208
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:57,474
      they have to come up      
     with some new tactics.     

209
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:08,619
        In North America,       
  a red fox relies on its ears  

210
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:13,523
       to listen for mice       
 scuttling around out of sight. 

211
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:20,430
         In Scandinavia,        

212
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:24,268
      a great gray owl also     
  has to hunt for hidden food.  

213
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:29,339
     It swoops in silently,     
     like a stealth bomber,     

214
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:33,076
    and then crashes through    
 the snow to snatch its victim. 

215
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:39,583
  In China, pandas have come up 
with their own special technique

216
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,019
        for clearing snow       
      off a bamboo branch.      

217
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,055
       Before they eat it,      

218
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:48,492
   they spin it around their    
   muzzles to brush it clean.   

219
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:57,834
     But some have switched     
     their diet altogether.     

220
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,540
        In the mountains        
       of southwest China,      

221
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:06,510
       where winter snow        
       lies a meter deep,       

222
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:10,781
  the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey  
         eats the lichen        

223
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,182
     that drapes the trees.     

224
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:16,887
     The lichen can survive     
        the freezing cold       

225
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:18,955
    of these high mountains.    

226
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,694
        This surprisingly       
         nutritious food        

227
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:26,496
        means the monkeys       
   can stay in these mountains  

228
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,365
         all year round.        

229
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:41,011
        But in some parts       
          of the world,         

230
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:44,514
the heavy snows of winter create
      an extreme challenge.     

231
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,053
          And survival          
     takes a bit of cunning.    

232
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:57,494
         In Yellowstone         
        in North America,       

233
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,429
         an otter family        
          has woken up          

234
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:02,666
  to discover their home river  
           is buried.           

235
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:08,872
         They don't have        
        anywhere to fish.       

236
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:12,442
      They're going to have     
     to relocate for winter.    

237
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:19,749
           In the same          
          neighborhood,         

238
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:23,620
       a coyote is having       
      similar difficulties.     

239
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:26,857
   Finding a meal around here   
     isn't going to be easy.    

240
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:44,441
  The otters have struck lucky. 

241
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:48,745
       There's an opening       
         in an icy lake.        

242
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:53,183
          And there are         
        still fish here.        

243
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:59,022
       It's fine for them.      

244
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:02,592
       But for the coyote,      
        life is trickier.       

245
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:06,963
       He's no fisherman,       

246
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:10,066
    but he is a master thief.   

247
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:14,537
           The otters           
         are suspicious.        

248
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:18,675
     The coyote would steal     
    their fish in an instant.   

249
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,111
   So they look for somewhere   
           to hide it.          

250
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:25,148
  The coyote might not be able  
        to see the otter,       

251
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:27,784
      but he can hear him.      

252
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:34,591
        He knows there's        
     a fish here somewhere.     

253
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:38,995
   Stashing it under the snow   
      won't fool a coyote.      

254
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,768
        He can smell it.        

255
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:06,256
             Bingo.             

256
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:09,392
     They're not called wily    
          for nothing.          

257
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,134
  As snow changes their world,  

258
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:22,172
 animals need to use every trick
    in the book to find food.   

259
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,942
         [wind gusting]         

260
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:27,143
     But there is one animal    

261
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,512
          that uses it          
      to gain an advantage.     

262
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:34,551
             Wolves.            

263
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:39,923
 These Canadian wolves are some 
  of the biggest in the world.  

264
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:44,561
      They're opportunists,     

265
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:46,529
       and they'll travel       
         long distances         

266
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:48,231
     in the search for food.    

267
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,770
        Deep snow usually       
     makes moving difficult,    

268
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:58,341
    but sometimes it creates    
         an opportunity.        

269
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:03,446
         This wolf pair         
     is looking for a bison.    

270
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:05,448
           [snorting]           

271
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:10,854
   But they're hard to catch.   

272
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:31,274
  And finding them in this huge 
      wilderness is tough.      

273
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:37,280
This is where the heavy snowfall
         offers a clue.         

274
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:46,756
       The bison have left      
          deep tracks.          

275
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:49,159
        Tracks the wolves       
           can follow.          

276
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:58,034
  These two are working alone,  
  without the help of a pack.   

277
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:12,048
        And they're after       
      very dangerous prey.      

278
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:17,053
     Bison have sharp horns     
        and weigh a ton,        

279
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:20,056
      ten times the weight      
           of a wolf.           

280
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:23,927
          But the wolves        
         have no choice.        

281
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,896
   A bison would keep them fed  
           for a week.          

282
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:30,934
         And in winter,         
   you have to take a chance.   

283
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:46,149
      Finally, they pick up     
          fresh scent.          

284
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:48,318
     The herd must be close.    

285
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:51,187
         The hunt is on.        

286
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:02,665
       [whines and pants]       

287
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:08,905
            [panting]           

288
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:27,724
   The wolves move up a gear.   

289
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:31,227
  They can maintain this speed  
         for kilometers.        

290
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,866
      The bison are tiring.     

291
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:43,339
   The weaker ones fall back.   

292
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:49,712
       And the wolf couple      
       are getting closer.      

293
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:57,987
     A trip is all it takes.    

294
00:26:02,026 --> 00:26:03,659
       Thanks to the snow,      

295
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:08,097
 the wolves are now a step ahead
         of starvation.         

296
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:14,971
  And the rest of the herd live 
 to fight another winter battle.

297
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:22,945
   Dealing with the challenge   
          of deep snow          

298
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:25,782
         forces animals         
      to raise their game.      

299
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:29,051
  But winter has another weapon 
         in its arsenal.        

300
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,959
         As days become         
      shorter than nights,      

301
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:40,196
  the temperature on the ground 
         begins to drop.        

302
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:47,303
   At zero degrees centigrade,  
       water turns to ice.      

303
00:26:56,781 --> 00:27:00,850
        Little by little,       
     whole worlds transform.    

304
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:15,731
          At the poles,         
      even the sea freezes.     

305
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:23,139
       To survive the ice,      
   you need to be resourceful.  

306
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:35,318
        In North America,       
         a freezing river       

307
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:37,353
     is a challenging place     
        for a small bird.       

308
00:27:37,388 --> 00:27:40,723
  But this tough little dipper  
         has extra thick        

309
00:27:40,758 --> 00:27:42,792
      waterproof feathers.      

310
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:45,995
      It will happily dive      
      right under the ice       

311
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:48,331
 if it thinks there's something 
          worth eating.         

312
00:27:55,239 --> 00:27:57,773
           In a frozen          
         Russian river,         

313
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:02,311
   sockeye salmon creep under   
        a ceiling of ice        

314
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:05,014
       to lay their eggs.       

315
00:28:05,049 --> 00:28:06,582
     It might look crowded,     

316
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:10,519
      but here they're safe     
  from attack by birds of prey. 

317
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:19,128
       In northern Canada,      

318
00:28:19,163 --> 00:28:22,832
  the winter freeze has created 
    a surprising opportunity.   

319
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:28,371
         This is a land         
       of lakes and bogs.       

320
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:32,575
   But in winter it's encased   
       in a sheet of ice,       

321
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,910
        two meters thick.       

322
00:28:40,718 --> 00:28:43,319
     And there is one animal    
  that has managed to turn this 

323
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:45,121
        to its advantage.       

324
00:28:48,726 --> 00:28:50,393
            Caribou.            

325
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,566
    Food is hard to come by,    

326
00:28:57,602 --> 00:29:01,504
 so they must spend their winter
     constantly on the move.    

327
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,142
    Despite their warm coats,   

328
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:09,145
     deep snow is a struggle    
            for them.           

329
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,081
       Trudging through it      
        saps their energy.      

330
00:29:16,854 --> 00:29:18,421
         But the caribou        
         have discovered        

331
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:20,790
   that snow doesn't build up   
           on the ice,          

332
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:24,026
     because powerful winds     
          blow it away.         

333
00:29:24,061 --> 00:29:26,796
             So now,            
      the lakes and rivers      

334
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:30,566
    become nature's very own    
           ice roads.           

335
00:29:32,336 --> 00:29:34,537
    It means they can travel    
          more quickly,         

336
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:37,273
     saving precious energy.    

337
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:41,444
   But first, you must master   
         the technique.         

338
00:30:16,013 --> 00:30:18,781
       The ice brings help      
     to caribou on the move.    

339
00:30:18,816 --> 00:30:21,350
      But on the other side     
          of the world,         

340
00:30:21,385 --> 00:30:23,452
     it's far less welcome.     

341
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:38,267
  In Antarctica, the freeze-up  
 has come in spectacular style. 

342
00:30:40,671 --> 00:30:44,139
    In winter, the continent    
        doubles in size.        

343
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,678
         It's now bigger        
         than the U.S.A.        

344
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,717
    The giant lock-up causes    
        an urgent problem       

345
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:56,685
       for one inhabitant.      

346
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:00,589
         A Weddell seal.        

347
00:31:01,525 --> 00:31:03,192
 As the sea around her freezes, 

348
00:31:03,227 --> 00:31:07,429
  her breathing hole has begun  
       to freeze over too.      

349
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:10,833
           Without it,          
        she'll suffocate.       

350
00:31:10,868 --> 00:31:14,536
     So she resorts to using    
   her teeth to keep it open.   

351
00:31:21,712 --> 00:31:25,581
 But at least she has a retreat 
    from the icy world above.   

352
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:34,156
 The sea down here is a constant
   minus 2 degrees centigrade.  

353
00:31:34,191 --> 00:31:38,293
  That's over 50 degrees warmer 
   than it is at the surface.   

354
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:53,342
     And it's been like this    
      for 25 million years.     

355
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:56,879
    Beneath the layer of ice,   

356
00:31:56,914 --> 00:31:59,615
     this enchanted kingdom     
          is protected          

357
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:02,518
        from the extreme        
       temperatures above.      

358
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:09,491
        It's a wonderland       
  of the strange and beautiful. 

359
00:32:24,775 --> 00:32:27,709
          In this safe,         
          stable world,         

360
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:30,446
         life explodes.         

361
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:43,225
         But even here,         
winter cold can crash the party.

362
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,833
     As temperatures plummet    
         on the surface,        

363
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:54,503
     it triggers the growth     
     of something sinister.     

364
00:33:00,444 --> 00:33:03,412
       This is a brinicle.      

365
00:33:03,447 --> 00:33:06,582
        Super-cooled water      
       sinking from above,      

366
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:09,551
    forming a pillar of ice.    

367
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:27,202
For the creatures of the seabed,
it's a stealthy finger of death.

368
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:54,229
    A river of ice imprisons    
    everything in its path.     

369
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:16,151
  Even those that think they've 
  beaten the extremes of winter 

370
00:34:16,186 --> 00:34:17,920
       can get caught out.      

371
00:34:24,828 --> 00:34:26,361
      As winter takes hold,     

372
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:29,631
     there are even greater     
      tribulations coming.      

373
00:34:31,468 --> 00:34:34,069
    Now animals not only have   
    to battle the conditions,   

374
00:34:34,104 --> 00:34:36,838
         they also have         
      to battle each other.     

375
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:39,474
            For some,           
         it's over food.        

376
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:42,110
           For others,          
        it's over mates.        

377
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:46,248
        But winter raises       
    the stakes on everything.   

378
00:34:55,559 --> 00:34:57,993
           In Russia,           
         black vultures,        

379
00:34:58,028 --> 00:35:00,529
       the world's largest      
         birds of prey,         

380
00:35:00,564 --> 00:35:03,832
    fight over scarce scraps    
          in the snow.          

381
00:35:03,867 --> 00:35:05,634
           [squawking]          

382
00:35:05,669 --> 00:35:07,102
     With their three-meter     
           wingspans,           

383
00:35:07,137 --> 00:35:10,038
         it's all about         
         intimidation.          

384
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:15,944
           In Canada,           
       winter is the time       

385
00:35:15,979 --> 00:35:19,147
   for young male polar bears   
           to tussle,           

386
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:21,349
    sorting out their status    

387
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:23,952
    without doing each other    
         serious damage.        

388
00:35:26,156 --> 00:35:29,825
    But it's in South Georgia   
      in the South Atlantic     

389
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:32,627
        where the biggest       
      winter brawls happen.     

390
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:34,396
           [snarling]           

391
00:35:34,431 --> 00:35:38,266
    Weighing in at four tons,   
      these elephant seals      

392
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,001
    are the world's largest.    

393
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:42,671
          It's a battle         
         of the big boys        

394
00:35:42,706 --> 00:35:45,173
          to establish          
        who's in charge.        

395
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:52,047
     On the Canadian tundra,    

396
00:35:52,082 --> 00:35:55,417
         there's another        
         battle looming.        

397
00:35:56,653 --> 00:36:00,388
   And it's winter's ultimate   
       heavyweight fight.       

398
00:36:05,295 --> 00:36:07,896
         Female caribou         
       are ready to mate.       

399
00:36:09,032 --> 00:36:10,465
       It needs to be now,      

400
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:13,034
   so their young will be born  
        in early spring.        

401
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,941
  So the massive caribou bulls  
  must compete with each other  

402
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:21,810
      to father the calves.     

403
00:36:24,114 --> 00:36:25,881
        The younger males       
    watch from the sidelines    

404
00:36:25,916 --> 00:36:28,650
       as the heavyweights      
        eye each other up.      

405
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:39,661
       [grunts and snarls]      

406
00:36:42,933 --> 00:36:44,733
    Serious fights are rare,    

407
00:36:44,768 --> 00:36:48,270
      but when they happen,     
   they can be very dangerous.  

408
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,476
     But while this old bull    
 has been dealing with a rival, 

409
00:36:54,511 --> 00:36:59,347
the young bucks have been trying
   their luck with his female.  

410
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:08,256
   He must break off his fight  
      and chase them away.      

411
00:37:21,705 --> 00:37:24,306
The younger males may be lighter
        on their feet...        

412
00:37:26,343 --> 00:37:29,878
       but his bulk means       
   he can muscle his way past.  

413
00:37:34,651 --> 00:37:37,519
     Another rival steps in     
        with a challenge.       

414
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:45,460
        But the old bull        
     easily deals with him.     

415
00:37:49,399 --> 00:37:51,533
           [grunting]           

416
00:37:56,773 --> 00:37:58,306
    As the chase slows down,    

417
00:37:58,342 --> 00:38:01,543
      he can finally impose     
           some order.          

418
00:38:05,382 --> 00:38:07,349
   Now he's shown who's boss,   

419
00:38:07,384 --> 00:38:10,018
         a look is all          
         that's needed.         

420
00:38:18,862 --> 00:38:21,396
       Only when he's sure      
       he's made his point      

421
00:38:21,431 --> 00:38:23,832
    can he claim his female.    

422
00:38:31,074 --> 00:38:34,442
The caribou may have a bruising 
battle for their chosen females.

423
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:40,115
     But for other animals,     

424
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:43,785
 competing for the right to mate
    is even more challenging.   

425
00:38:49,326 --> 00:38:51,526
     In a forest in Finland,    

426
00:38:51,561 --> 00:38:55,363
   a black grouse is preparing  
        to put on a show.       

427
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:57,399
            [cooing]            

428
00:39:10,213 --> 00:39:13,381
    It's the most important     
    performance of his life.    

429
00:39:15,685 --> 00:39:18,887
It will determine whether or not
        he gets to breed.       

430
00:39:30,767 --> 00:39:33,835
     Only one male will get     
  the chance to mate this year, 

431
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:38,640
     and that male will have    
        all the females.        

432
00:39:38,675 --> 00:39:41,342
           The others           
        will get nothing.       

433
00:39:42,712 --> 00:39:46,347
     With such high stakes,     
   the competition is intense.  

434
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:52,020
           [squawking]          

435
00:40:04,167 --> 00:40:07,035
  The females begin to arrive,  

436
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:09,637
        and the dance-off       
         moves up a gear.       

437
00:40:18,114 --> 00:40:21,082
  More and more males join in.  

438
00:40:28,258 --> 00:40:31,559
    These birds can wait years  
   for an opportunity to mate.  

439
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:34,462
         Some will never        
     get the chance at all.     

440
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:42,170
The females seem to have spotted
       a potential winner.      

441
00:40:45,275 --> 00:40:49,377
        It's half dance,        
     half handbags at dawn.     

442
00:40:56,586 --> 00:41:00,655
 One last lunge is all he needs 
        to win the bout.        

443
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:08,696
         It's all over.         

444
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:11,132
      The loser slips away.     

445
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:19,874
       The best performer       
     is the strongest male,     

446
00:41:19,909 --> 00:41:23,411
and that's just what the females
           are after.           

447
00:41:24,981 --> 00:41:27,315
   His strength will be passed  
        to their chicks,        

448
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:30,752
 giving them the very best start
            in life.            

449
00:41:37,994 --> 00:41:39,927
    As the battles of winter    
          are settled,          

450
00:41:39,963 --> 00:41:43,931
  there are tantalizing signs   
  that the season is changing.  

451
00:41:49,472 --> 00:41:54,542
For some animals, it's their one
    chance to meet a partner.   

452
00:42:03,953 --> 00:42:08,022
   A male polar bear has been   
 wandering the Arctic ice alone,

453
00:42:08,057 --> 00:42:10,825
           all through          
        the dark winter.        

454
00:42:11,728 --> 00:42:13,294
     But as the sun returns,    

455
00:42:13,329 --> 00:42:16,330
     it triggers his desire     
         to find a mate.        

456
00:42:18,301 --> 00:42:20,601
    It's not an easy search.    

457
00:42:23,907 --> 00:42:25,473
      In these vast wastes,     

458
00:42:25,508 --> 00:42:29,143
         potential dates        
    are few and far between.    

459
00:42:35,852 --> 00:42:40,755
     Eventually, he picks up    
      an unmistakable scent.    

460
00:42:43,092 --> 00:42:44,926
            A female.           

461
00:42:46,729 --> 00:42:49,130
   She could be 10 miles away.  

462
00:42:51,367 --> 00:42:52,900
    So he follows her tracks.   

463
00:43:10,854 --> 00:43:13,087
          There she is.         

464
00:43:16,759 --> 00:43:18,526
      She's half his size,      

465
00:43:18,561 --> 00:43:21,929
      so first-date nerves      
      are understandable.       

466
00:43:30,206 --> 00:43:32,807
    He needs to win her over    
             gently.            

467
00:43:43,653 --> 00:43:46,587
        He waits for her        
     to make the first move.    

468
00:43:56,699 --> 00:44:00,301
        She leads him off       
        to higher ground.       

469
00:44:11,614 --> 00:44:15,182
  Their relationship is brief.  

470
00:44:15,218 --> 00:44:18,953
   And when they part company,  

471
00:44:18,988 --> 00:44:22,423
       they will probably       
       never meet again.        

472
00:44:22,458 --> 00:44:24,191
            [growls]            

473
00:44:25,828 --> 00:44:27,228
         [wind gusting]         

474
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:29,597
     The wastes of the Arctic   
    might seem a tricky place   

475
00:44:29,632 --> 00:44:30,798
         to find a mate,        

476
00:44:30,833 --> 00:44:34,402
   but there are places that,   
        at first glance,        

477
00:44:34,437 --> 00:44:36,671
    seem even more unlikely.    

478
00:44:38,474 --> 00:44:41,509
     This is the Gobi Desert    
          in Mongolia.          

479
00:44:45,715 --> 00:44:47,248
         It goes through        
       one of the greatest      

480
00:44:47,283 --> 00:44:49,984
   seasonal temperature swings  
            on Earth.           

481
00:44:52,922 --> 00:44:56,257
     In summer it can reach     
     50 degrees centigrade,     

482
00:44:56,292 --> 00:44:59,193
  and in winter it's minus 40.  

483
00:45:01,064 --> 00:45:04,198
But these are perfect conditions
      for a Bactrian camel      

484
00:45:04,233 --> 00:45:07,635
    to practice his seduction   
           techniques.          

485
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:13,274
    Freezing winds have come    
         from the north.        

486
00:45:14,977 --> 00:45:17,211
   And they have brought snow   
         to the desert.         

487
00:45:19,282 --> 00:45:22,349
     This male suddenly has     
    a limitless water source.   

488
00:45:22,385 --> 00:45:24,585
      He can eat the snow.      

489
00:45:26,756 --> 00:45:30,958
       He's no longer tied      
    to sporadic water holes.    

490
00:45:30,993 --> 00:45:33,727
       He's free to wander      
         huge distances         

491
00:45:33,763 --> 00:45:36,197
         in the search          
         for new mates.         

492
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:38,933
   And when he finds a female,  

493
00:45:38,968 --> 00:45:42,369
      he has an unusual way     
    of getting her attention.   

494
00:45:44,006 --> 00:45:46,607
    He urinates on his legs.    

495
00:45:46,642 --> 00:45:50,244
      Then, using his tail,     
    flicks it over his back.    

496
00:45:52,415 --> 00:45:54,148
          [camel howls]         

497
00:45:54,183 --> 00:45:55,983
      If he plays it right,     

498
00:45:56,018 --> 00:46:00,020
 he might attract as many as 20 
 females before winter is over. 

499
00:46:08,431 --> 00:46:12,600
   While camels are looking for 
  new mates in the Gobi Desert, 

500
00:46:12,635 --> 00:46:14,802
on the other side of the world, 

501
00:46:14,837 --> 00:46:19,440
       older relationships      
   are about to be rekindled.   

502
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:35,756
  In Antarctica, the long cold  
  winter is coming to an end.   

503
00:46:37,393 --> 00:46:40,227
           The sun has          
        finally returned.       

504
00:46:52,174 --> 00:46:54,808
  The male penguin has survived 
        one hundred days        

505
00:46:54,844 --> 00:46:58,579
        fighting the cold       
 to keep his precious egg warm. 

506
00:47:00,917 --> 00:47:03,484
        He's lost nearly        
      half his body weight.     

507
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:05,552
         [all chirping]         

508
00:47:05,588 --> 00:47:08,389
 As he enjoys the first warming 
          rays of sun,          

509
00:47:08,424 --> 00:47:12,026
   he hears a familiar sound.   

510
00:47:12,061 --> 00:47:14,728
      [squawking distantly]     

511
00:47:14,764 --> 00:47:17,665
      Figures are appearing     
         on the horizon.        

512
00:47:23,239 --> 00:47:25,906
     His mate has come back.    

513
00:47:28,444 --> 00:47:30,244
         [all squawking]        

514
00:47:39,955 --> 00:47:42,323
         There's a great        
       cacophony of calls       

515
00:47:42,358 --> 00:47:45,159
   as couples find each other   
         in the throng.         

516
00:47:56,772 --> 00:48:01,475
    Reunited, he can finally    
 introduce her to a new arrival.

517
00:48:02,812 --> 00:48:04,311
           [chirping]           

518
00:48:04,346 --> 00:48:07,448
         All his effort         
         was worth it.          

519
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:23,464
    With enormous commitment,   

520
00:48:23,499 --> 00:48:25,165
    these parents have given    
          their chicks          

521
00:48:25,201 --> 00:48:28,135
  the very best start in life.  

522
00:48:30,039 --> 00:48:33,373
      They're ready to join     
         the family firm        

523
00:48:33,409 --> 00:48:35,876
         as the ultimate        
        winter survivors.       

524
00:48:46,622 --> 00:48:50,257
 Winter brings huge challenges  
 to animals caught in its path. 

525
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:53,994
       Some have to battle      
     freezing temperatures.     

526
00:48:55,898 --> 00:48:58,832
     Others have to struggle    
    to find food in the snow.   

527
00:49:01,937 --> 00:49:05,272
   And some have to fight off   
       fierce competition.      

528
00:49:05,307 --> 00:49:07,708
           [squawking]          

529
00:49:07,743 --> 00:49:10,144
       But through it all,      

530
00:49:10,179 --> 00:49:12,613
       animals find mates.      

531
00:49:13,716 --> 00:49:15,949
          And some even         
         raise a family.        

532
00:49:17,586 --> 00:49:19,453
       By being clever...       

533
00:49:24,093 --> 00:49:25,359
         resourceful...         

534
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:29,530
          and brave...          

535
00:49:30,699 --> 00:49:34,101
         you can survive        
       and even prosper...      

536
00:49:35,638 --> 00:49:37,437
  no matter what winter brings. 

537
00:51:55,377 --> 00:51:57,377
   ANNOUNCER: WASHINGTON'S      
   OLDEST COMMERCIAL DISTRICT,  

538
00:51:57,379 --> 00:51:58,979
    KNOWN AS BARRACKS ROW,      

539
00:51:58,981 --> 00:52:01,982
IS TUCKED AWAY IN THE SOUTHERN  
     HALF OF CAPITOL HILL       

540
00:52:01,984 --> 00:52:03,517
    NEAR EASTERN MARKET.        

541
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:08,121
 A SHORT ALLEYWAY OFF 8th STREET
 LEADS DIRECTLY TO THE FRIDGE,  

542
00:52:08,123 --> 00:52:12,025
    A UNIQUE ART GALLERY        
    THAT OPENED IN 2009.        

543
00:52:12,027 --> 00:52:15,262
MAN: THE FRIDGE IS MY BABY.     
   IT'S MY LIFE'S WORK.         

544
00:52:15,264 --> 00:52:18,465
    IT IS AN ART SPACE          
    THAT I FOUNDED              

545
00:52:18,467 --> 00:52:21,768
    TO REALLY HELP UNCOVER      
    YOUNGER ARTISTS--           

546
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:25,105
ARTISTS WHO HAVE NOT NECESSARILY
     EXHIBITED OTHER PLACES.    

547
00:52:25,107 --> 00:52:29,543
  ANNOUNCER: THE FRIDGE IS      
DEDICATED TO SHOWING THE WORK   
     OF STREET ARTISTS,         

548
00:52:29,545 --> 00:52:32,145
    INCLUDING GRAFFITI          
    AND STICKER ARTISTS.        

549
00:52:32,147 --> 00:52:34,314
 GOLDSTEIN: A LOT OF THE ARTISTS
      THAT I'VE WORKED WITH     

550
00:52:34,316 --> 00:52:36,216
    HAVE DONE WORK              
    OUT ON THE STREET,          

551
00:52:36,218 --> 00:52:38,285
         MEANING LEGALLY        
         OR ILLEGALLY,          

552
00:52:38,287 --> 00:52:42,923
    AS GRAFFITI ARTISTS         
    OR OTHER TYPES OF VANDALS   
    AND TAGGERS EVEN            

553
00:52:42,925 --> 00:52:45,592
     WHO--WHO HAVE DEVELOPED    
     INTO INDOOR ARTISTS.       

554
00:52:45,594 --> 00:52:48,895
 ANNOUNCER: IN ADDITION TO BEING
      THE GALLERY'S OWNER,      

555
00:52:48,897 --> 00:52:51,998
    ALEX GOLDSTEIN IS ALSO      
    AN ARTIST HIMSELF.          

556
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,501
    HE RECENTLY COMPLETED       
    HIS SECOND SOLO SHOW        

557
00:52:54,503 --> 00:52:56,670
    AT THE FRIDGE,              
    WHICH FEATURED IMAGES       

558
00:52:56,672 --> 00:53:00,040
OF JOHN LENNON SPRAY-PAINTED    
ON THE BACKS OF STREET SIGNS.   

559
00:53:00,042 --> 00:53:03,009
   GOLDSTEIN: I'VE HAD THE BAD  
   HABIT OF PAINTING ON THE     
   BACKS OF STREET SIGNS        

560
00:53:03,011 --> 00:53:05,178
     FOR MANY, MANY DECADES.    

561
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:07,781
    EVERYTHING IN MODERATION,   
    INCLUDING MODERATION.       

562
00:53:07,783 --> 00:53:12,018
    SO, FOR THIS SHOW,          
    I DECIDED TO BRING THE      
    STREET INTO THE GALLERY.    

563
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:14,054
    ANNOUNCER: THE SHOW ALSO    
    GAVE HIM THE OPPORTUNITY    

564
00:53:14,056 --> 00:53:16,790
    TO SHOWCASE WORK            
    BY HIS LATE FATHER.         

565
00:53:16,792 --> 00:53:20,293
GOLDSTEIN: MY DAD WAS A SCULPTOR
    FOR A PERIOD OF HIS LIFE,   

566
00:53:20,295 --> 00:53:23,997
 AND I'M GONNA BE DISPLAYING FOR
 THE FIRST TIME EVER IN PUBLIC  

567
00:53:23,999 --> 00:53:27,534
SOME SCULPTURES THAT HE MADE.   

568
00:53:27,536 --> 00:53:31,037
    AND SO THAT'S KIND OF,      
    I THINK, A TRIBUTE TO HIM   

569
00:53:31,039 --> 00:53:33,073
        AND MY MOM, TOO.        

570
00:53:33,075 --> 00:53:35,375
    STREET ART, YOU KNOW,       
    WHEN I WAS YOUNGER,         

571
00:53:35,377 --> 00:53:36,810
    WASN'T CALLED THAT.         

572
00:53:36,812 --> 00:53:39,045
    IT WAS JUST VANDALISM.      

573
00:53:39,047 --> 00:53:41,715
A LOT OF ARTISTS WERE PUTTING   
  UP ARTWORK ON THE STREET      

574
00:53:41,717 --> 00:53:44,918
   AS A WAY TO GET IT SHOWN,    
   JUST TO SHOW TO EACH OTHER.  

575
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:50,557
   NOW THE BUILDING DEVELOPERS  
   HAVE BOUGHT ALL THOSE        
   BUILDINGS IN D.C.,           

576
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:54,494
AND THEY ACTUALLY HIRE US-TYPE  
        STREET ARTISTS          

577
00:53:54,496 --> 00:53:56,663
      TO ACTUALLY COME IN       
AND DECORATE THE NEW PROPERTY,  

578
00:53:56,665 --> 00:53:59,566
    WHICH IS REALLY AN          
    INTERESTING EVOLUTION.      

579
00:53:59,568 --> 00:54:03,003
     I LIKE SEEING GRAFFITI.    
     IT'S A SIGN OF LIFE.       

580
00:54:03,005 --> 00:54:06,873
IT'S A SIGN OF PEOPLE TAKING    
OWNERSHIP OF THEIR OWN SPACE.   

581
00:54:06,875 --> 00:54:09,109
AND WHILE I'M A BUILDING OWNER  
        AND I'D BE MAD          

582
00:54:09,111 --> 00:54:10,577
        IF SOMEONE TAGGED       
   THE FRONT OF MY BUILDING--   

583
00:54:10,579 --> 00:54:12,145
    WHATEVER. I CAN JUST        
        PAINT OVER IT           

584
00:54:12,147 --> 00:54:14,481
    AND KNOW, ULTIMATELY,       
    IT'S NOT REALLY HARMFUL.
