00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:39,851
THAT IS UNUSUAL, AT LEAST HALF  
OF THAT TRUMP TWEET WAS         

119
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:40,252
OF THAT TRUMP TWEET WAS         
ACCURATE.                       

120
00:03:40,254 --> 00:03:43,322
ACCURATE.                       
MANY OF OUR TRADING PARTNERS,   

121
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:45,524
MANY OF OUR TRADING PARTNERS,   
CHINA THE PAST HAVE MANAGED OR  

122
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:47,759
CHINA THE PAST HAVE MANAGED OR  
MISALIGNED THEIR CURRENCY VALUES

123
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:49,728
MISALIGNED THEIR CURRENCY VALUES
PRECISELY THE WAY YOU DESCRIBED.

124
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,730
PRECISELY THE WAY YOU DESCRIBED.
TO MAKE OUR EXPORTS CHEAPER AND 

125
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,131
TO MAKE OUR EXPORTS CHEAPER AND 
OURS TO THEM MORE EXPENSIVE.    

126
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:54,933
OURS TO THEM MORE EXPENSIVE.    
AND THE RESULT IS A SIGNIFICANT 

127
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:56,301
AND THE RESULT IS A SIGNIFICANT 
TRADE IMBALANCE WHICH WE'VE HAD 

128
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:59,037
TRADE IMBALANCE WHICH WE'VE HAD 
IN THIS COUNTRY FOR MANY        

129
00:03:59,039 --> 00:03:59,371
IN THIS COUNTRY FOR MANY        
DECADES.                        

130
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:01,506
DECADES.                        
BUT THE IRONIC THING IS THAT    

131
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:03,041
BUT THE IRONIC THING IS THAT    
TRUMP'S ACTIONS HAVE ACTUALLY   

132
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:04,476
TRUMP'S ACTIONS HAVE ACTUALLY   
MADE THIS PROBLEM WORSE.        

133
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:06,011
MADE THIS PROBLEM WORSE.        
THEY'VE STRENGTHENED THE DOLLAR.

134
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:11,350
THEY'VE STRENGTHENED THE DOLLAR.
>> SO, FIRST OF ALL, IS IT      

135
00:04:11,352 --> 00:04:12,584
>> SO, FIRST OF ALL, IS IT      
INACHIEVABLE, WHEN DONALD TRUMP 

136
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,219
INACHIEVABLE, WHEN DONALD TRUMP 
SAYS WE SHOULD PLAY THAT GAME?  

137
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:15,921
SAYS WE SHOULD PLAY THAT GAME?  
CAN YOU PLAY THAT GAME GIVEN    

138
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:17,356
CAN YOU PLAY THAT GAME GIVEN    
THAT THE ENTIRE WORLD COLLECTS  

139
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,726
THAT THE ENTIRE WORLD COLLECTS  
U.S. DOLLARS NOT JUST TO BUY    

140
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:23,528
U.S. DOLLARS NOT JUST TO BUY    
GOODS, BUT TO BUY OIL AND GOLD. 

141
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,298
GOODS, BUT TO BUY OIL AND GOLD. 
AND CAN THE U.S. UNLIKE ZIMBABWE

142
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,267
AND CAN THE U.S. UNLIKE ZIMBABWE
OR THAILAND OR A PLACE LIKE THAT

143
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:30,902
OR THAILAND OR A PLACE LIKE THAT
CAN IT ACTUALLY MANIPULATE ITS  

144
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:31,603
CAN IT ACTUALLY MANIPULATE ITS  
CURRENCY DELIBERATELY?          

145
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,772
CURRENCY DELIBERATELY?          
>> THE ANSWER IS, YES, IT COULD.

146
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,541
>> THE ANSWER IS, YES, IT COULD.
BUT YOU RAISE A REALLY IMPORTANT

147
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:37,509
BUT YOU RAISE A REALLY IMPORTANT
FUNDAMENTAL POINT.              

148
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:39,645
FUNDAMENTAL POINT.              
THE U.S. DOLLAR IS THE PRIMARY  

149
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:41,046
THE U.S. DOLLAR IS THE PRIMARY  
RESERVE CURRENCY OF THE WORLD.  

150
00:04:41,048 --> 00:04:43,181
RESERVE CURRENCY OF THE WORLD.  
THAT'S THE CURRENCY AS YOU JUST 

151
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:45,050
THAT'S THE CURRENCY AS YOU JUST 
SAID OTHER COUNTRIES OFTEN TRADE

152
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:45,684
SAID OTHER COUNTRIES OFTEN TRADE
IN.                             

153
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:47,185
IN.                             
ALSO, WHAT'S THE SAFEST ASSET IF

154
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:49,254
ALSO, WHAT'S THE SAFEST ASSET IF
YOU WANT TO PARK YOUR MONEY     

155
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:49,955
YOU WANT TO PARK YOUR MONEY     
SOMEWHERE SAFE?                 

156
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:51,023
SOMEWHERE SAFE?                 
IT'S HERE IN THE U.S.           

157
00:04:51,025 --> 00:04:53,292
IT'S HERE IN THE U.S.           
SO THAT MEANS FOLKS NEED DOLLARS

158
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:54,926
SO THAT MEANS FOLKS NEED DOLLARS
TO BUY OUR TREASURY SECURITIES. 

159
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:57,329
TO BUY OUR TREASURY SECURITIES. 
BY THE WAY, WHEN I SAID TRUMP IS

160
00:04:57,331 --> 00:04:58,563
BY THE WAY, WHEN I SAID TRUMP IS
PARTLY AT THE CORE OF THIS      

161
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:00,899
PARTLY AT THE CORE OF THIS      
PROBLEM, BY RUNNING THESE VERY, 

162
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:02,501
PROBLEM, BY RUNNING THESE VERY, 
VERY LARGE BUDGET DEFICITS      

163
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:05,203
VERY LARGE BUDGET DEFICITS      
ESPECIALLY IN A PERIOD OF LOW   

164
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:06,238
ESPECIALLY IN A PERIOD OF LOW   
UNEMPLOYMENT, NOT ONLY IS OUR   

165
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,106
UNEMPLOYMENT, NOT ONLY IS OUR   
COUNTRY GOING FASTER AND THAT   

166
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:10,509
COUNTRY GOING FASTER AND THAT   
TENDS TO MAKE OUR DOLLAR        

167
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:11,977
TENDS TO MAKE OUR DOLLAR        
STRONGER THAN OTHER CURRENCIES, 

168
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,079
STRONGER THAN OTHER CURRENCIES, 
BUT IT'S PULLING IN MORE CAPITAL

169
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:15,580
BUT IT'S PULLING IN MORE CAPITAL
FROM ACROSS THE GLOBE, SEEKING  

170
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:16,682
FROM ACROSS THE GLOBE, SEEKING  
THESE SAFE ASSETS.              

171
00:05:16,684 --> 00:05:18,483
THESE SAFE ASSETS.              
BUT BOTTOM LINE, YES, THERE ARE 

172
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:19,584
BUT BOTTOM LINE, YES, THERE ARE 
THINGS WE COULD DO.             

173
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:21,953
THINGS WE COULD DO.             
AND, FRANKLY, THINGS WE SHOULD  

174
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:22,220
AND, FRANKLY, THINGS WE SHOULD  
DO.                             

175
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:24,122
DO.                             
THE LEAST WE SHOULD DO IS       

176
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:25,357
THE LEAST WE SHOULD DO IS       
IDENTIFY THOSE WHO MANIPULATE   

177
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:27,359
IDENTIFY THOSE WHO MANIPULATE   
THEIR CURRENCIES AND AMAZINGLY, 

178
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:28,894
THEIR CURRENCIES AND AMAZINGLY, 
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS    

179
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:30,062
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS    
ESSENTIALLY REFUSED TO DO SO.   

180
00:05:30,064 --> 00:05:30,662
ESSENTIALLY REFUSED TO DO SO.   
>> ALL RIGHT.                   

181
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,130
>> ALL RIGHT.                   
LET'S TALK ABOUT BEING THE      

182
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:33,732
LET'S TALK ABOUT BEING THE      
PRIMARY RESERVE CURRENCY OF THE 

183
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:34,032
PRIMARY RESERVE CURRENCY OF THE 
WORLD.                          

184
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:35,400
WORLD.                          
ONE OF THE REASONS THE U.S. IS  

185
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:37,769
ONE OF THE REASONS THE U.S. IS  
THAT THING IS BECAUSE IT'S      

186
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:38,570
THAT THING IS BECAUSE IT'S      
RELATIVELY STABLE.              

187
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:40,806
RELATIVELY STABLE.              
IF YOU PUT YOUR MONEY INTO U.S. 

188
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:42,941
IF YOU PUT YOUR MONEY INTO U.S. 
DOLLARS TO BUY TREASURIES OR TO 

189
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:44,309
DOLLARS TO BUY TREASURIES OR TO 
BUY PROPERTY IN MIAMI OR        

190
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:46,578
BUY PROPERTY IN MIAMI OR        
WHATEVER IT IS YOU DO WITH YOUR

00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,513
WHATEVER IT IS YOU DO WITH YOUR 
MONEY, THE VALUE OF THE CURRENCY

192
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,048
MONEY, THE VALUE OF THE CURRENCY
DOESN'T TEND TO FLUCTUATE ALL   

193
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:50,782
DOESN'T TEND TO FLUCTUATE ALL   
THAT MUCH.                      

194
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:52,718
THAT MUCH.                      
IF WE SEND OUT A SIGNAL THAT    

195
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,119
IF WE SEND OUT A SIGNAL THAT    
WE'RE LOOKING TO REDUCE THE     

196
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:55,721
WE'RE LOOKING TO REDUCE THE     
VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR, WHAT'S

197
00:05:55,723 --> 00:05:59,057
VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR, WHAT'S
THE EFFECT OF ALL OF THE PEOPLE,

198
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:00,292
THE EFFECT OF ALL OF THE PEOPLE,
COMPANIES, SOVEREIGN FRONTS TO

COMPANIES, SOVEREIGN FRONTS TO  
INVEST IN DOLLARS BECAUSE IT'S A

200
00:06:02,296 --> 00:06:03,161
INVEST IN DOLLARS BECAUSE IT'S A
SAFE CURRENCY?                  

201
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:04,629
SAFE CURRENCY?                  
>> IT'S REALLY HARD TO SAY      

202
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:06,264
>> IT'S REALLY HARD TO SAY      
BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T DO THAT.  

203
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:08,266
BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T DO THAT.  
I WILL SAY, THOUGH, THAT THE    

204
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:10,202
I WILL SAY, THOUGH, THAT THE    
DOLLAR FLUCTUATES PRETTY        

205
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:10,836
DOLLAR FLUCTUATES PRETTY        
SIGNIFICANTLY.                  

206
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:13,105
SIGNIFICANTLY.                  
IN FACT, ONE OF THE WAYS YOU    

207
00:06:13,107 --> 00:06:15,774
IN FACT, ONE OF THE WAYS YOU    
COULD TELL WHEN CHINA AND OTHERS

208
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:17,609
COULD TELL WHEN CHINA AND OTHERS
WERE PEGGING THEIR CURRENCY IS  

209
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:20,245
WERE PEGGING THEIR CURRENCY IS  
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T FLUCTUATE.  

210
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:22,080
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T FLUCTUATE.  
THEY KEPT IT AT A STRAIGHT LINE.

211
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:23,949
THEY KEPT IT AT A STRAIGHT LINE.
THE U.S. DOLLAR GOES UP AND     

212
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:24,249
THE U.S. DOLLAR GOES UP AND     
DOWN.                           

213
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:26,718
DOWN.                           
IT'S UP 7%, 10% OVER THE LAST   

214
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,419
IT'S UP 7%, 10% OVER THE LAST   
FEW MONTHS.                     

215
00:06:27,421 --> 00:06:29,287
FEW MONTHS.                     
AND WE DON'T SEE DRAMATIC       

216
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:30,622
AND WE DON'T SEE DRAMATIC       
CHANGES IN ANY OF THE KIND OF   

217
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:32,057
CHANGES IN ANY OF THE KIND OF   
TRADES YOU JUST MENTIONED.      

218
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:34,326
TRADES YOU JUST MENTIONED.      
SO, I ACTUALLY THINK THAT IT    

219
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:35,927
SO, I ACTUALLY THINK THAT IT    
WOULD BE WORTH OUR WHILE TO AT  

220
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:37,829
WOULD BE WORTH OUR WHILE TO AT  
LEAST EXAMINE WAYS IN WHICH WE  

221
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:40,632
LEAST EXAMINE WAYS IN WHICH WE  
CAN PUSH BACK AGAINST THOSE WHO 

222
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:41,800
CAN PUSH BACK AGAINST THOSE WHO 
MISALIGN THEIR CURRENCIES       

223
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:43,602
MISALIGN THEIR CURRENCIES       
BECAUSE IT DOES LEAD TO         

224
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:44,636
BECAUSE IT DOES LEAD TO         
SIGNIFICANT TRADE IMBALANCES.   

225
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:46,772
SIGNIFICANT TRADE IMBALANCES.   
I JUST WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR,   

226
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:48,707
I JUST WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR,

YOU ARE WATCHING MSNBC.

00:38:37,099 --> 00:38:38,798
     when you can stay home

     with Neulasta® Onpro®?     

1189
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:41,768
    Strong chemo can put you    

1190
00:38:41,803 --> 00:38:43,053
 at risk of serious infection.  

1191
00:38:43,305 --> 00:38:44,471
         In a key study         

1192
00:38:44,506 --> 00:38:47,941
   Neulasta® reduced the risk   
  of infection from 17% to 1%   

1193
00:38:47,976 --> 00:38:49,943
        a 94% decrease.         

1194
00:38:50,145 --> 00:38:51,528
        Neulasta® Onpro®        
         is designed to         

1195
00:38:51,563 --> 00:38:53,446
       deliver Neulasta®        
      the day after chemo       

1196
00:38:53,732 --> 00:38:55,315
         and is used by         
      most patients today.      

1197
00:38:56,151 --> 00:38:57,817
    Neulasta® is for certain    
   cancer patients receiving    

1198
00:38:57,852 --> 00:38:58,785
      strong chemotherapy.      

1199
00:38:59,321 --> 00:39:00,987
     Do not take Neulasta®      
    if you're allergic to it    

1200
00:39:01,022 --> 00:39:03,039
   or Neupogen (filgrastim).    

1201
00:39:03,158 --> 00:39:05,125
    An incomplete dose could    
    increase infection risk.    

1202
00:39:05,327 --> 00:39:06,292
        Ruptured spleen,        

1203
00:39:06,328 --> 00:39:08,661
    sometimes fatal as well     
    as serious lung problems    

1204
00:39:08,696 --> 00:39:10,330
      allergic reactions,       
        kidney injuries         

1205
00:39:10,365 --> 00:39:12,415
       and capillary leak       
    syndrome have occurred.     

1206
00:39:12,751 --> 00:39:15,001
  Report abdominal or shoulder  
 tip pain, trouble breathing or 

1207
00:39:15,036 --> 00:39:17,137
     allergic reactions to      
    your doctor right away.     

1208
00:39:17,506 --> 00:39:19,139
        In patients with        
     sickle cell disorders,     

1209
00:39:19,174 --> 00:39:20,924
       serious, sometimes       
    fatal crises can occur.     

1210
00:39:21,543 --> 00:39:23,426
  The most common side effect   
    is bone and muscle ache.    

1211
00:39:24,096 --> 00:39:25,011
    If you'd rather be home     

1212
00:39:25,046 --> 00:39:27,397
          ask your doctor about 
            Neulasta® Onpro®.   

1213
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,617
    Pay no more than $5 per     
     dose with Copay Card.      

1214
00:39:47,386 --> 00:39:49,085
I had a few good tricks to help 
hide my bladder leak pad.       

1215
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:51,004
   Like the old "tunic tug".    

1216
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:53,173
             But Always Discreet
             is less bulky.     

1217
00:39:53,208 --> 00:39:54,591
                   And it<i> really</i>
                   protects.    

1218
00:39:54,643 --> 00:39:56,926
 'Cause it turns liquid to gel. 

1219
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:59,179
   So I have nothing to hide.
