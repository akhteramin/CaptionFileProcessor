00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:09,358
IN LEADERSHIP, WHO ARE LEADING  
COMMITTEES WANT TO DO HEARINGS  

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:09,625
COMMITTEES WANT TO DO HEARINGS  
FIRST.                          

7
00:00:09,627 --> 00:00:11,493
FIRST.                          
IN PART BECAUSE THEY THINK THE  

8
00:00:11,495 --> 00:00:12,928
IN PART BECAUSE THEY THINK THE  
PUBLIC CASE NEEDS TO BE BUILT.  

9
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,197
PUBLIC CASE NEEDS TO BE BUILT.  
A LOT OF THE STUFF IN THE       

10
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:16,131
A LOT OF THE STUFF IN THE       
MUELLER REPORT WASN'T TOTALLY   

11
00:00:16,133 --> 00:00:18,367
MUELLER REPORT WASN'T TOTALLY   
SHOCKING, AS IT'S BEEN REPORTED.

12
00:00:18,369 --> 00:00:20,569
SHOCKING, AS IT'S BEEN REPORTED.
AND THEY NEED TO HAVE PEOPLE

00:00:20,571 --> 00:00:21,670
AND THEY NEED TO HAVE PEOPLE    
TESTIFY, HAVE DRAMATIC MOMENTS, 

14
00:00:21,672 --> 00:00:22,838
TESTIFY, HAVE DRAMATIC MOMENTS, 
SO THAT THE PUBLIC IS BEHIND    

15
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:23,739
SO THAT THE PUBLIC IS BEHIND    
THEM A LITTLE BIT.

17
00:00:25,243 --> 00:00:26,675
OR THEY CAN SEE THAT.           
AND I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE  

18
00:00:26,677 --> 00:00:27,743
AND I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE  
CALCULATION THAT THEY'RE MAKING

00:00:27,745 --> 00:00:30,045
CALCULATION THAT THEY'RE MAKING

SERIOUSLY, IT'S VERY HARD TO SAY
THERE SHOULDN'T AT LEAST BE

THERE SHOULDN'T AT LEAST BE     
HEARINGS TO SAY WHAT HAPPENED,

CAN DO THEM FASTER OR SLOWER.   

56
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:25,301
CAN DO THEM FASTER OR SLOWER.   
AT SOME POINT, UYOU'LL HAVE TO  

57
00:01:25,303 --> 00:01:26,268
AT SOME POINT, UYOU'LL HAVE TO  
SAY, WE'VE HAD THE HEARINGS,
