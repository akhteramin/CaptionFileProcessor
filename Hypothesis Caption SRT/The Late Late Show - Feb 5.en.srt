THEATERS AND ON NETFLIX WHRANG  

835
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:20,136

837
00:41:14,105 --> 00:41:15,821
Ok I'll admit. I didn't keep my 
place as clean as I would like  

838
00:41:15,857 --> 00:41:17,490
     'cuz I'm way too busy.     

839
00:41:17,525 --> 00:41:20,309
Who's got the time to chase     
around down dirt, dust and hair?

840
00:41:20,328 --> 00:41:23,663
So now, I use Heavy Duty Swiffer
Sweeper and Dusters.            

841
00:41:23,698 --> 00:41:26,999
For hard-to-reach places, Duster
makes it easy to clean.         

842
00:41:27,035 --> 00:41:29,318
 It captures dust in one swipe. 

843
00:41:29,337 --> 00:41:31,487
          Ha! Gotcha!

00:41:31,506 --> 00:41:33,706
And Sweeper Heavy               
Duty cloths lock away           

845
00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:35,424
  twice as much dirt and dust.  

846
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:38,160
 It gets stuff deep in the      
 grooves other tools can miss.  

847
00:41:38,179 --> 00:41:41,013
 Y'know what? My place... is a  
 lot cleaner now.               

848
00:41:41,049 --> 00:41:53,175
Stop cleaning. Start Swiffering.
