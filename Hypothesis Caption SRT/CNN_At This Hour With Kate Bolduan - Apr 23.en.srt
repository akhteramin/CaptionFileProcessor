     Metastatic breast          
     cancer is relentless,      

375
00:10:41,861 --> 00:10:43,661
  but I was relentless first.   

376
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:47,165
 Relentless about learning the  
 first song we ever danced to.  

377
00:10:47,233 --> 00:10:49,867
      About teaching him        
      to put others first.      

378
00:10:49,936 --> 00:10:52,136
     About helping her          
     raise her first child.     

379
00:10:52,205 --> 00:10:56,074
And when I was first diagnosed, 
my choice was everyday Verzenio.

380
00:10:56,142 --> 00:10:59,377
It's the only one of its kind   
that can be taken every day.    

381
00:10:59,446 --> 00:11:02,647
It gives us more time           
without cancer progressing.     

382
00:11:02,716 --> 00:11:05,483
Verzenio is the only            
CDK4 & 6 inhibitor              

383
00:11:05,552 --> 00:11:08,319
approved with hormonal therapy  
that can be taken every day     

384
00:11:08,388 --> 00:11:11,756
for postmenopausal women        
with HR+, HER2- MBC.            

385
00:11:11,825 --> 00:11:13,758
Diarrhea is common,             
may be severe,                  

386
00:11:13,827 --> 00:11:15,493
or cause dehydration            
or infection.                   

387
00:11:15,562 --> 00:11:17,161
Before taking Verzenio,         
tell your doctor                

388
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,497
  if you have fever, chills,    
  or other signs of infection.  

389
00:11:19,566 --> 00:11:21,799
    Verzenio may cause low      
    white blood cell counts,    

390
00:11:21,868 --> 00:11:23,234
       which may cause          
       serious infection        

391
00:11:23,303 --> 00:11:24,269
    that can lead to death.     

392
00:11:24,337 --> 00:11:25,937
      Serious liver             
      problems can occur.       

393
00:11:26,006 --> 00:11:28,406
  Symptoms include tiredness,   
  appetite loss, stomach pain,  

394
00:11:28,475 --> 00:11:29,707
   and bleeding or bruising.    

395
00:11:29,776 --> 00:11:31,276
   Blood clots that can lead    
   to death have occurred.      

396
00:11:31,344 --> 00:11:32,844
    Tell your doctor if you     
    have pain or swelling       

397
00:11:32,913 --> 00:11:34,145
     in your arms or legs,      

398
00:11:34,214 --> 00:11:36,347
shortness of breath, chest pain,
rapid breathing or heart rate,  

399
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,683
or if you are pregnant,         
nursing, or plan to be pregnant.

400
00:11:38,752 --> 00:11:40,952
  Common side effects           
  include nausea, infections,   

401
00:11:41,021 --> 00:11:43,488
 low blood cells and platelets, 
 decreased appetite, headache,  

402
00:11:43,557 --> 00:11:45,323
      abdominal pain,           
      tiredness, vomiting,      

403
00:11:45,392 --> 00:11:46,491
   and hair thinning or loss.   

404
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,460
My relentless reason: it's them.

405
00:11:48,528 --> 00:11:50,829
My choice with my               
doctor: it's Verzenio.          

406
00:11:50,897 --> 00:11:52,564
Ask your doctor if              
everyday Verzenio               

407
00:11:52,632 --> 00:11:53,765
