       ripped-up posters,       

11
00:00:28,796 --> 00:00:32,231

00:00:56,023 --> 00:00:59,458
    that my housemates spent    
  their time on making for me.  

21
00:00:59,527 --> 00:01:03,195
Did someone have an idea        
to (bleep) bend all my signs?   

22
00:01:03,264 --> 00:01:06,699

              Oh, (bleep)!      
              Oh, Nicole! Sha!  
Chad, you're safe!              

317
00:13:40,557 --> 00:13:43,024
     So Nicole is back now      
  and she doesn't have an ex,   
       and I'm just like,       

318
00:13:43,093 --> 00:13:45,293
"Thank God I don't have to deal 
     with that situation."      

319
00:13:45,362 --> 00:13:46,861
        So how did the guy look?
        Tell me.                

320
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,096
               Does he look cute
               or whatever?     

321
00:13:48,165 --> 00:13:50,398
I'm kind of scared              
for Jay.                        

322
00:13:50,467 --> 00:13:51,733
(Janelle)                       
Why?                            

323
00:13:51,802 --> 00:13:53,134
He said he's here               
to get her back,                

324
00:13:53,203 --> 00:13:55,503
and he's here for no other      
reason but to get her back.     

325
00:13:55,572 --> 00:13:57,138
                    (Chad)      
                    Oh, (bleep).

326
00:13:57,207 --> 00:13:59,941
 Honestly, it should be called  
  "Morgan's Ex on the Beach."   

327
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:02,610
      Like, how many exes       
       do you have, girl?       
        Like, just stop.        

328
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:05,747
           (cheering)           

329
00:14:05,816 --> 00:14:08,483
        (all exclaiming)        

330
00:14:08,552 --> 00:14:11,286
All right, pull the chair,      
pull the chair, pull the chair. 
Hold on.                        

331
00:14:11,354 --> 00:14:13,888
          Hey, Morgan.          
          Take a seat.          

332
00:14:13,957 --> 00:14:15,490
                 Let the man    
                 do the talking.

333
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:16,725
Goddamn.                        

334
00:14:16,793 --> 00:14:18,159
           (laughter)           

335
00:14:18,228 --> 00:14:22,030
This Monte character?           
(grunts) Damn!                  
                            Ugh!

336
00:14:22,099 --> 00:14:24,232
Um, I will say this.            

337
00:14:24,301 --> 00:14:27,135
All the boys you                
brought into the house          
are fine as (bleep).            

338
00:14:27,204 --> 00:14:29,404
And-- yes.                      
              So at least       
              I have good taste.

339
00:14:29,473 --> 00:14:31,573
          What are you here for?
       What are your intentions?

340
00:14:31,641 --> 00:14:33,408
What are my intentions?         
    Are you here to h her?      

341
00:14:33,477 --> 00:14:35,477
        e ■;  to rekindle that ?
Hell yeah, man.                 

342
00:14:35,545 --> 00:14:38,113
I'm gonna rekindle the fire.    
What are you talking about?     
              Okay, there we go.

343
00:14:38,181 --> 00:14:40,882
"Oh, I'm gonna be just Mr. Tough
  Guy here to steal your girl.  

344
00:14:40,951 --> 00:14:43,985
 "I'ma flirt with her in front  
  of you and I'm gonna pretend  
         like I'm not.          

345
00:14:44,054 --> 00:14:48,456
      Ha ha! I'm so cool!"      
             Clown.             

346
00:14:48,525 --> 00:14:50,158
    If things don't work out    
           with Jay,            

347
00:14:50,227 --> 00:14:52,394
   are we allowed to take him   
     into our relationship?     

348
00:14:52,462 --> 00:14:53,862
y                               
           (laughter)           

349
00:14:53,931 --> 00:14:56,665
You're allowed to take him      
right now if you want.          
We can share.                   

350
00:14:56,733 --> 00:14:59,834
          (announcer)           
     Oh, God, it's so sweet     
      it's making me sick.      

351
00:14:59,903 --> 00:15:01,970
   Let's see if everyone else   
     can be so levelheaded      

352
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:06,608
 as Janelle, Farrah, and Nurys  
     return from their stay     
         at the hotel.          

353
00:15:06,677 --> 00:15:08,710
Baby, baby, baby!               
Hey!                            

354
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:10,645
elle.                           
                   Hey!         

355
00:15:10,714 --> 00:15:12,214
Whoo!                           
           What's up?           

356
00:15:12,282 --> 00:15:17,485
      So I've had a night       
      to cool down, relax.      

357
00:15:17,487 --> 00:15:20,789
  Going in the house, for me,   
        it is stressful         

358
00:15:20,858 --> 00:15:22,491
      because I'm dealing       
      to with the factlax.      

359
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:26,127
    that I really am, like,     
     heartbroken for real.      

360
00:15:26,196 --> 00:15:28,864
  Diandra, can I talk to you?   
Yes.                            

361
00:15:28,932 --> 00:15:31,399
         My main point          
     to pull Diandra aside      

362
00:15:31,468 --> 00:15:34,236
    was to apologize to her     
  and let her know that, hey,   

363
00:15:34,304 --> 00:15:36,037
   I know we've had our beefs   
          in the past.          

364
00:15:36,106 --> 00:15:38,540
   Like, I know we personally   
   don't care for each other,   

365
00:15:38,592 --> 00:15:42,294
  but the attack I made on her  
    was not personal at all.    

366
00:15:46,266 --> 00:15:50,435
So basically I just wanted      
to genuinely apologize          
for putting my hands on you.    

367
00:15:50,504 --> 00:15:56,541
Like, my issues are with him.   
Like, I should conduct myself   
better just as a human being.   

368
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:59,644
You (bleep) kiss her?!          
You're gonna kiss her?!         

369
00:15:59,713 --> 00:16:01,079
                 That is her ex.

370
00:16:01,148 --> 00:16:03,048
          Oh, (bleep).          
  Oh, you ain't tell me that.   

371
00:16:03,117 --> 00:16:04,383
(bleep) you laughing,           
bitch?!                         

372
00:16:04,451 --> 00:16:06,985
   Janelle! Janelle! Janelle!   
You (bleep)hole!                

373
00:16:07,054 --> 00:16:09,688
So I apologize.                 
          I accept your apology.

374
00:16:09,757 --> 00:16:11,623
                Um, I wasn't    
                laughing at you.

375
00:16:11,692 --> 00:16:14,192
       Like, I'm sorry.         
       Like, when I get nervous,
       I'm like...              

376
00:16:14,261 --> 00:16:16,461
               (nervous chuckle)
               But I literally--

377
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:18,864
      all I said, I looked back,
      like, this is crazy.      

378
00:16:18,932 --> 00:16:22,067
      And thankful that you came
      to apologize for putting  
      your hands on me.         

379
00:16:22,136 --> 00:16:24,670
No problem.                     
Like, I meant it, 'cause I      
shouldn't be hitting people.    

380
00:16:24,738 --> 00:16:29,574
I saw Janelle go up to Diandra, 
 apologize for the whole thing, 

381
00:16:29,643 --> 00:16:32,210
       argument they had,       
 and just literally broke down. 

382
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:36,048
       And you know what?       
    It takes a grown person     
to apologize and to admit that. 

383
00:16:36,116 --> 00:16:37,683
          I accept your apology.

384
00:16:37,751 --> 00:16:42,788
 With me, if someone says sorry 
  and they genuinely mean it,   

385
00:16:42,856 --> 00:16:43,956
      I will forgive you.       

386
00:16:44,024 --> 00:16:46,858
         Will I forget?         
      No. I'm not stupid.       

387
00:16:46,927 --> 00:16:48,727
     I will definitely keep     
        my eyes up open,        

388
00:16:48,796 --> 00:16:51,630
 but the minute you say sorry,  
    all right, cte.             

389
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:54,366
I'ma do a handshake.            
                           Okay.

390
00:16:54,435 --> 00:16:55,500
             We'll take it slow.
Yes.                            

391
00:16:55,569 --> 00:16:57,669
Okay. Okay, thank you.          
           All right.           

392
00:16:57,738 --> 00:17:00,472
          (announcer)           
Now that Janelle and Diandra are
       on the same page,        

393
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:03,442
   the house vibes seem to be   
        in a good place.        

394
00:17:03,511 --> 00:17:07,012
     Maybe Farrah and Nurys     
   can squash their beef too.   

395
00:17:08,582 --> 00:17:10,816
         Hello, house.          

396
00:17:10,885 --> 00:17:11,884
          Hey, Farrah.          

397
00:17:11,952 --> 00:17:13,185
             Hello.             

398
00:17:13,254 --> 00:17:14,553
      There's another one.      

399
00:17:14,622 --> 00:17:16,455
       So I'm back today        
   and I'm going in the house   

400
00:17:16,524 --> 00:17:19,424
   and I'm just staying away    
   from literally everything,   

401
00:17:19,493 --> 00:17:21,827
  everyone, and (bleep) them.   

402
00:17:21,896 --> 00:17:23,262
              Aww.              
Have a drink.                   

403
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,435
           I'm back.            
           I'm back.            

404
00:17:29,503 --> 00:17:32,738
          (screaming)           

405
00:17:32,807 --> 00:17:34,807
           (laughter)           

406
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:37,743
      I'm extremely happy       
   that Nurys came back here.   

407
00:17:37,812 --> 00:17:41,447
     She did nothing wrong,     
   but I understand as to why   
       she had to leave.        

408
00:17:41,515 --> 00:17:44,850
    But I am genuinely upset    
   that Farrah is still here.   

409
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:48,487
I'm gonna go ahead and leave it 
    in the fate of the Lord     

410
00:17:48,556 --> 00:17:50,756
 and He will take care of that. 
        Karma's a bitch.        

411
00:17:50,825 --> 00:17:53,258
      (indistinct chatter)      

412
00:17:53,327 --> 00:17:56,261
         Good.                  
         So if I started talking
         to another girl,       

413
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:57,463
        she'd probd out.        
Hey, can we talk?               

414
00:17:57,531 --> 00:17:58,931
        Hi, how are you?        
             Sure.              

415
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,566
In private?                     
             Okay.              

416
00:18:00,634 --> 00:18:02,434
          I don't have          
      to (bleep) apologize      

417
00:18:02,503 --> 00:18:05,070
     because I reacted like     
     a normal human being,      

418
00:18:05,139 --> 00:18:07,006
    but better than a normal    
          human being,          

419
00:18:07,074 --> 00:18:10,009
  'cause a normal human being   
     wouldn't have stopped      
      (bleep) hitting her.      

420
00:18:10,077 --> 00:18:12,311
          (announcer)           
 Actually, a normal human being 

421
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,880
 probably wouldn't kick someone 
         in the vagina.         

422
00:18:14,949 --> 00:18:17,983
          I guess I just wanted 
          to ask where your head
          was at yesterday.     

423
00:18:18,052 --> 00:18:22,121
            'Cause I'm confused 
            as to where all that
            animosity came from.

424
00:18:22,189 --> 00:18:23,689
                All that, like--
Okay, so I'm                    
not confused.                   

425
00:18:23,758 --> 00:18:27,326
I'm very aware about            
what happened yesterday.        

426
00:18:27,395 --> 00:18:29,328
When I come in                  
to just hear what               

427
00:18:29,397 --> 00:18:31,730
my friend's ex-boyfriend        
is saying,                      

428
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:35,334
all I'm hearing is insults,     
um, from you about me,          

429
00:18:35,403 --> 00:18:37,369
acting like you know me.        
I think--                       

430
00:18:37,438 --> 00:18:39,905
       That all was brought up  
       afterwards, so that's not
       what we're talking about.

431
00:18:39,974 --> 00:18:42,875
And continuation of that        
and that was--                  
          No, see, now you're   
          trying to play victim.

432
00:18:42,944 --> 00:18:44,777
            That's not what     
            we're gonna do.     
So I'm not a victim.            

433
00:18:44,845 --> 00:18:47,413
So I know you                   
were just drinking.             
I'm not drinking.               

434
00:18:47,481 --> 00:18:49,815
                     Okay. Okay.
I'm wide awake.                 
I have no patience for that.    

435
00:18:49,884 --> 00:18:52,384
I apologized for you            
insulting me, you touching me.  
                             No.

436
00:18:52,453 --> 00:18:54,787
              See, that's that--
              no, no.           
And I'm the bigger woman.       

437
00:18:54,856 --> 00:18:57,022
                 Okay. Ha, okay.
So I'm a real woman who knows   
what really happened.           

438
00:18:57,091 --> 00:18:58,491
                     Okay, okay.
You're out of control.          

439
00:18:58,559 --> 00:18:59,859
                 Oh, my God.    
                 She's literally
                 delusional.    

440
00:18:59,927 --> 00:19:01,126
So stop.                        
Get in control.                 

441
00:19:01,195 --> 00:19:06,665
   This bitch is delusional, yo.
Okay!

Bitch, you're the trash.        

445
00:19:11,773 --> 00:19:14,039
You kicked me in the vagina     
because I was having            

446
00:19:14,108 --> 00:19:15,407
a conversation                  
with someone.                   

447
00:19:15,476 --> 00:19:17,376
Like, (bleep) psychotic.        

448
00:19:17,445 --> 00:19:20,579
         Get ahold of yourself, 
         out-of-control groupie.

449
00:19:20,648 --> 00:19:24,016
What's wrong?                   
           No, she's still lying
           and is a trash can.

452
00:19:26,721 --> 00:19:28,487
     Do I need to apologize     
           to someone           

453
00:19:28,556 --> 00:19:30,723
  who put that on themselves,   
who caused that for themselves, 

454
00:19:30,792 --> 00:19:32,925
   who (bleep) deserves worse   
       than what she got?       

455
00:19:32,994 --> 00:19:34,126
              No.

00:21:38,687 --> 00:21:39,652
songs are really about

       big life moments.

It's a sensible gift.

Protection for you              
and your family,

Makes no sense.

a great song.

It's (bleep) delusional.        
           Trash can!           

487
00:23:09,544 --> 00:23:11,711
Trash?                          
Have you seen the way           
that you carry yourself?

       What the (bleep)?

Trash can outside               
is a liar.                      

490
00:23:16,685 --> 00:23:20,920
 Now, you don't kick nobody in  
the vagina, point blank, period.

      all these problems?       

494
00:23:29,931 --> 00:23:33,033
      A nice family dinner      
  just like mom used to make.   

495
00:23:33,101 --> 00:23:35,602
Okay, so who knows              
how to call for delivery?       

496

           (laughter)

           Domino's!            
                  No, seriously.

498
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,373
  I'm obviously a peacemaker.   

499
00:23:40,442 --> 00:23:43,643
     And I feel like maybe      
  all the exes cooking dinner   

500
00:23:43,712 --> 00:23:46,146
 for the OGs tonight could help 
   the entire house, really.    

501
00:23:46,214 --> 00:23:47,781
         Are we making          
       some bad (bleep)?        

502
00:23:47,849 --> 00:23:51,184
No, we're trying                
to keep the peac   All right.   

503
00:23:51,253 --> 00:23:54,688
     So I am taking control     
       of the situation.

Okay, let's do this.            

505
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:58,258
We need to boil                 
the sweet potatoes.             

506
00:23:58,327 --> 00:23:59,292
                Yeah, I got you.
Okay.                           

507
00:23:59,361 --> 00:24:01,428
I'm gonna handle                
the meat...                     

508
00:24:01,496 --> 00:24:05,765
like I usually do.              
           (laughter)           

509
00:24:05,834 --> 00:24:07,167
    I'm gonna get you a pot     
        and then I think        

510
00:24:07,236 --> 00:24:08,134
    we put it back in there.    

511
00:24:08,203 --> 00:24:10,737
    We're doing some tacos,     
           burritos,            

512
00:24:10,806 --> 00:24:12,072
   a couple loaves of bread,    

513
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,541
  a bacon and Brussels sprout   
            salad...            

514
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:16,810
 That ain't good.               
             It's gonna be good,
             trust me.          

515
00:24:16,879 --> 00:24:18,745
   ...and basically anything    
   we can find in the fridge.   

516
00:24:18,814 --> 00:24:20,614
This is looking                 
so beautiful, guys.             

517
00:24:20,682 --> 00:24:22,582
I'm so proud of us.             

518
00:24:22,651 --> 00:24:26,586
               Dinner is served!
        Yay! Dinnertime!        

519
00:24:26,655 --> 00:24:27,954
You guys made that?             

520
00:24:28,023 --> 00:24:30,457
            All right, where's  
            the PB&J platter at?

521
00:24:30,526 --> 00:24:31,958
    This mother(bleep) wants    
            a PB&J.             

522
00:24:32,027 --> 00:24:33,093
(bleep) like                    
catered food.

793
00:38:34,505 --> 00:38:36,772
   I know I don't have a say

795
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:40,710
       To me, he doesn't        
      contribute anything.      

796
00:38:40,778 --> 00:38:43,079
     He has the personality     
     of a (bleep) pet rock.     

797
00:38:43,147 --> 00:38:45,815
And I feel like                 
Jay's pissed with you           
just because, like--            

798
00:38:45,884 --> 00:38:47,650
     Why would he be pissed     
            with me?            

799
00:38:47,719 --> 00:38:49,752
I feel like he's pissed         
at you and her because--        

800
00:38:49,821 --> 00:38:51,454
           Not at me.           
     She was kissing back.      

801
00:38:51,523 --> 00:38:53,189
       It wasn't like a--       
    she said it was a snipe.    

802
00:38:53,258 --> 00:38:55,691
       It wasn't a snipe.       
It wasn't a snipe at all.       

803
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,493

    she could focus on Jay.

   what's she gonna look at?

   You know what I'm saying?    

809
00:39:13,178 --> 00:39:17,647
It's hard for me                
to deal with the house

that he's not gonna do it again.

   Like, I need you to repent   
     to me like I'm Jesus.

819

             You don't even know
             what you want.     

820
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,214
  When we originally broke up,  
    she left me, literally.     

821
00:39:51,283 --> 00:39:54,083
But now I feel like she kind of 
 wants the best of both worlds. 

822
00:39:54,085 --> 00:39:56,052
The onlyhat matters

about me and you right now,lds. 

824
00:39:58,223 --> 00:40:00,857

00:42:12,424 --> 00:42:14,758

You don't trust me anymore.     
It's like--                     

880
00:42:14,826 --> 00:42:17,561
          You honestly believe  
          that I don't trust you
          at all?

            more honest with me.

00:42:21,533 --> 00:42:26,703
       I would prefer the truth.
       Not 10%, 50%, 90%.

00:42:26,772 --> 00:42:28,705
               Give me the whole
               damn thing.

 I'll give her a chance again.

           (Diandra)            
The only singles on the chopping
  block are Corey and Farrah.   

899
00:43:15,154 --> 00:43:17,487
      Corey because Morgan      
         wants him out.         

900
00:43:17,556 --> 00:43:22,092
 She doesn't feel that she can  
   continue her relationship    
   ay while he's here.          

901
00:43:22,161 --> 00:43:24,061
         And Farrah is          
     on the chopping block.     

902
00:43:24,129 --> 00:43:28,131
 It's 'cause she kicked my girl 
  in the vagina and she needs   
        to (bleep) off.         

903
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,967
         Morgan's like,         
   "Someone help me, please."   

904
00:43:30,035 --> 00:43:32,102
    But she's not actually      
    physically getting attacked,
    and it's bull(bleep).       

905
00:43:32,171 --> 00:43:34,071
    You know I get your side,   
    and I feel so bad for Morgan

906
00:43:34,139 --> 00:43:37,074
   that she's gotten bull(bleep)
   after bull(bleep)            
   after bull(bleep).           

907
00:43:37,142 --> 00:43:39,743
       But to be honest,        
       she did not get          
       this physically attacked.

908
00:43:39,812 --> 00:43:42,212
   That's so (bleep) up that any
   of you guys are even deciding

909
00:43:42,281 --> 00:43:45,115
          for even the slightest
          (bleep) bit.          
          Seriously?            

910
00:43:45,184 --> 00:43:46,984
 I don't understand why people  
      wanna get Corey out.      

911
00:43:47,052 --> 00:43:50,220
  Corey hasn't done anything.   
       Farrcrazy,               
    sional bitch.               

912
00:43:50,289 --> 00:43:54,791
         She's the one          
      that's the problem.       

913
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:57,427
     We're supposed to be exesng
     and we're supposed         
     to stick together, correct?

914
00:43:57,496 --> 00:43:59,263
        Correct, and none       
        of you guys had my back.

915
00:43:59,331 --> 00:44:01,031
              That's the biggest
              bull(bleep) ever. 

916
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:02,199
Even though I know              
she hurt you,                   

917
00:44:02,268 --> 00:44:04,334
and, like, Farrah did           
do things wrong,                

918
00:44:04,403 --> 00:44:06,103
everyone's done                 
a couple things wrong,          
and at this point, like,        

919
00:44:06,172 --> 00:44:07,671
it's like we're not all         
gonna come to one.              

920
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:10,607
I think we should all just vote 
what we think at this point.    

921
00:44:10,676 --> 00:44:13,010
   So I'm just gonna go ahead   
 and crush Farrah just because  

922
00:44:13,078 --> 00:44:15,913
      I feel like Farrah,       
  ifgonna respect her,          
 she'll respect you right back. 

923
00:44:15,981 --> 00:44:20,083
She treats all of us pretty good
     other than the people      
     that she doesn't like,     

924
00:44:20,152 --> 00:44:21,752
       which is everyone        
       for the most part.       

925
00:44:21,821 --> 00:44:23,487
   I shouldn't have to (bleep)--
   this should be easy.         

926
00:44:23,556 --> 00:44:25,122
             It shouldn't       
             even be a question.

927
00:44:25,191 --> 00:44:27,157
I totally understand why        
you want her out.               

928
00:44:27,226 --> 00:44:28,492
I wish y'all would just         
talk it out.                    

929
00:44:28,561 --> 00:44:30,961
But you don't even              
wanna talk to me, so...         

930
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:32,696
     I thought she did try      
        to talk to her.         

931
00:44:32,765 --> 00:44:34,565
     She did try                
     to talk to Farrah,         
     and Farrah just blew--     

932
00:44:34,633 --> 00:44:36,333
          I already know        
          I'm the bigger person.
          I don't need to.      

933
00:44:36,402 --> 00:44:38,102
             I'm not going up   
             to the bitch again.

934
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:40,037
           And yes, I will      
           call her a bitch     
           'cause she's a bitch.

935
00:44:40,106 --> 00:44:42,773
      Like, I really don't care.

936
00:44:42,842 --> 00:44:45,809
            (Nurys)             
  It sucks to see that people   
      don't have my back.       

937
00:44:45,878 --> 00:44:48,645
    I haven't done anything     
        to deserve that.        

938
00:44:48,714 --> 00:44:50,681
           (sobbing)            

939
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:56,320
(Nora)                          
Before we start - how much is my
tax prep going to cost?         

940
00:44:56,355 --> 00:44:58,022
 (Tax Guy)                      
 I can't really say that until  
 the end.                       

941
00:44:58,124 --> 00:44:59,323
      (Lisa) [off-screen]       
      Wait, no.                 

942
00:44:59,425 --> 00:45:01,525
     H&R Block has upfront,     
     transparent pricing        

943
00:45:01,627 --> 00:45:02,593
     so you know the price      
     before you begin.          

944
00:45:02,695 --> 00:45:03,661
   (Nora)                       
   So, it can work like that.   

945
00:45:03,796 --> 00:45:04,461
             (Lisa)             
             Yup!               

946
00:45:05,431 --> 00:45:05,996
 (Tax Guy)                      
 Oh, so you want transparency.  

947

00:58:02,577 --> 00:58:04,844
        (all exclaiming)        
          Oh, (bleep).          

1171
00:58:04,913 --> 00:58:06,346
                            Wow.
                  Winning!      

1172
00:58:06,414 --> 00:58:08,648
                  So you gave   
                  the crush vote
                  to Janelle?   

1173
00:58:08,717 --> 00:58:14,521
Yes, I did.                     
What I respect about her        

1174
00:58:18,393 --> 00:58:20,994
I gave you that crush vote.     
but respect that,gized          
so that ■2■(applause)2#2#2      

1175
00:58:21,062 --> 00:58:22,862
Darian ain't getting            
his (bleep).                    

1176
00:58:22,931 --> 00:58:27,400
 I am pissed because Darian was 
 going to fully take the credit 

1177
00:58:27,469 --> 00:58:31,037
  for that crush, but instead   
    ting it on someone          

1178
00:58:31,106 --> 00:58:34,641
   that you barely even know,   
  it's like, put it towards me  

1179
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:37,877
     to show me that, like,     
           you care.            

1180
00:58:37,946 --> 00:58:44,451
           Corey, please step up
           to your pineapple.   

1181
00:58:44,519 --> 00:58:47,454
á                               
              If I had to guess,
              you got some chips
              in there.         

1182
00:58:47,522 --> 00:58:48,989
Yeah.                           

1183
00:58:49,057 --> 00:58:50,290
                Let's get to it.

1184
00:58:55,897 --> 00:58:57,764
                First chip, cut.

1185
00:59:00,302 --> 00:59:04,104
             Got another chip...
             which is a cut.    

1186
00:59:07,109 --> 00:59:10,911
         You have two cut votes,
         which means you're on  
         the hot seat.          

1187
00:59:10,979 --> 00:59:12,846
                    Take a seat.

1188
00:59:12,915 --> 00:59:15,081
 I might be going home because  
    of, like, her messiness,    

1189
00:59:15,150 --> 00:59:18,251
it's jusir to me                
      that I would have to      
      potentially go home.      

1190
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:21,521
    It'd be stupid for them     
  to kick me out of the house   
  'cause I never cause drama.   

1191
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:24,090
    Like, I'm here to date,     
   you know, maybe find love.   

1192
00:59:24,159 --> 00:59:26,827
               So, next, Farrah.

1193
00:59:26,895 --> 00:59:30,463
              Please step up    
              to your pineapple.

1194
00:59:30,532 --> 00:59:33,400
              You think you have
              any crush votes,  
              any cut votes?    

1195
00:59:33,469 --> 00:59:37,103
I mean, I hope I have           
some crush votes.               

1196
00:59:37,172 --> 00:59:39,606
            All right, you ready
            to get to it?       
Yeah.                           

1197
00:59:43,078 --> 00:59:44,544
                      First one.

1198
00:59:48,484 --> 00:59:50,350
      I'm so over Farrah!       

1199
00:59:50,419 --> 00:59:52,686
    You're giving everybody     
          a hard time.          

1200
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:54,287
    You are a (bleep) person    
         to everybody.          

1201
00:59:54,356 --> 00:59:55,622
         You kicked one         
     of my closest friends      

1202
00:59:55,691 --> 00:59:57,391
 house in her vagina.           

1203
00:59:57,459 --> 00:59:58,959
        You need to get         
        the (bleep) out.
