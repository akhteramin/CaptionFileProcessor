    JARDIANCE asked:            

426
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:24,062
   When it comes to managing

427
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:25,263

428
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:30,935
           Let's see.           
   Most of you say lower A1C.   

429
00:14:30,937 --> 00:14:32,403
     But only a few of you      

430
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:34,472
 are thinking about your heart. 

431
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:37,442
    Fact is, even though        
    it helps to manage A1C,     

432
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:40,361
     type 2 diabetes still      
     increases your risk        

433
00:14:40,363 --> 00:14:42,030
       of a fatal heart         
       attack or stroke.        

434
00:14:42,032 --> 00:14:45,033
     JARDIANCE is the first

436
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:49,821
  for adults who have type 2    
  diabetes and heart disease,   

437
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:52,206
   JARDIANCE significantly      
   reduces the risk of dying    

438
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:53,824
  from a cardiovascular event   

439
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:56,127
        and lowers A1C,         
    with diet and exercise.
