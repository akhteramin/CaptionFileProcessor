>> NO.                          
I HEARD THAT FROM SOMEBODY.     

1013
00:34:16,588 --> 00:34:18,021
I HEARD THAT FROM SOMEBODY.     
I WAS QUESTIONED ABOUT IT BY    

1014
00:34:18,023 --> 00:34:21,124
I WAS QUESTIONED ABOUT IT BY

NOBODY SAID YOU CAN'T DO THIS.  

1018
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,463
NOBODY SAID YOU CAN'T DO THIS.  
PARTLY BECAUSE WE WOULD BE GLAD 

1019
00:34:26,465 --> 00:34:28,498
PARTLY BECAUSE WE WOULD BE GLAD 
IN THIS TIME TO TRADE A SENATE

IN THIS TIME TO TRADE A SENATE  
SEED FOR THE PRESIDENCY.        

1021
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:32,102
SEED FOR THE PRESIDENCY.        
AND I THINK THAT THERE IS A     

1022
00:34:32,104 --> 00:34:33,804
AND I THINK THAT THERE IS A     
RECOGNITION THAT IF I WERE THE

00:34:33,806 --> 00:34:34,604
RECOGNITION THAT IF I WERE THE

THE BEST CHANCE TO BEAT TRUMP.  

1025
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:41,611
THE BEST CHANCE TO BEAT TRUMP.  
BUT I THINK THAT IF THIS DIGNITY

THEY START TALKING TO WORKERS,  

1032
00:34:49,655 --> 00:34:55,492

OF COURSE WE PLAYED A PRO -- A

00:35:01,867 --> 00:35:02,933
AND A WHOLE BUNCH OF ISSUES AS A
PROGRESSIVE BUT WE HAVE TO TALK 

1037
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:04,501
PROGRESSIVE BUT WE HAVE TO TALK 
TO WORKERS.

1114
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:17,761
       Hi, I'm Bob Harper,      

1115
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:19,596
       and I recently had       
         a heart attack.        

1116
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:20,647
       It changed my life.      

1117
00:38:20,682 --> 00:38:21,781
       But I'm a survivor.      

1118
00:38:21,817 --> 00:38:24,617
    After my heart attack, my   
   doctor prescribed BRILINTA.  

1119
00:38:24,653 --> 00:38:27,320
  It's for people who have been 
hospitalized for a heart attack.

1120
00:38:27,355 --> 00:38:29,322
     BRILINTA is taken with     
       a low-dose aspirin.      

1121
00:38:29,357 --> 00:38:31,190
   No more than 100 milligrams  

1122
00:38:31,243 --> 00:38:33,243
          as it affects         
    how well BRILINTA works.    

1123
00:38:33,295 --> 00:38:35,412
  BRILINTA helps keep platelets 
     from sticking together     

1124
00:38:35,464 --> 00:38:36,496
   and forming a clot.          

1125
00:38:36,531 --> 00:38:37,747
  In a clinical study,          

1126
00:38:37,799 --> 00:38:39,532
 BRILINTA worked better         
      than Plavix.              

1127
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:42,252
 BRILINTA reduced the chance of 
 having another heart attack... 

1128
00:38:42,304 --> 00:38:43,553
      ...or dying from one.     

1129
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:45,972
   <i> Don't stop taking BRILINTA</i>  
<i>without talking to your doctor,</i> 

1130
00:38:46,008 --> 00:38:47,974
   <i> since stopping it too soon</i>  
      <i> increases your risk</i>      

1131
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:49,976
    <i> of clots in your stent,</i>    
     <i> heart attack, stroke,</i>     

1132
00:38:50,012 --> 00:38:51,261
        <i> and even death.</i>        

1133
00:38:51,313 --> 00:38:52,378
  <i> BRILINTA may cause bruising</i>  
    <i> or bleeding more easily,</i>   

1134
00:38:52,397 --> 00:38:53,763
          <i> or serious,</i>          
   <i> sometimes fatal bleeding.</i>   

1135
00:38:53,815 --> 00:38:57,100
<i>Don't take BRILINTA if you have</i> 
 <i> bleeding, like stomach ulcers,</i>

1136
00:38:57,152 --> 00:38:59,686
  <i> a history of bleeding in the</i> 
<i>brain, or severe liver problems.</i>

1137
00:38:59,721 --> 00:39:01,271
       <i> Slow heart rhythm</i>       
       <i> has been reported.</i>      

1138
00:39:01,323 --> 00:39:02,388
<i>Tell your doctor about bleeding</i> 

1139
00:39:02,407 --> 00:39:04,524
  <i> new or unexpected shortness</i>  
           <i> of breath</i>           

1140
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:06,526
      <i> any planned surgery,</i>     
  <i> and all medicines you take.</i>  

1141
00:39:06,561 --> 00:39:08,361
       If you recently had      
         a heart attack,        

1142
00:39:08,396 --> 00:39:10,947
   ask your doctor if BRILINTA  
        is right for you.       

1143
00:39:10,999 --> 00:39:12,999
   My heart is worth BRILINTA.  

1144
00:39:13,401 --> 00:39:14,567
If you can't afford your        
      medication,
