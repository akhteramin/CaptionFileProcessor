>> Kelly: But would you like    
to see the world's largest pool?

109
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,387
to see the world's largest pool?
It's at a resort in Chile.      

110
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:09,121
It's at a resort in Chile.      
>> Ryan: Look at that.          

111
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:09,821
>> Ryan: Look at that.          
Oh, my God.                     

112
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:10,922
Oh, my God.                     
>> Kelly: It's the San Alfonso  

113
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,624
>> Kelly: It's the San Alfonso  
del Mar, world's largest        

114
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:14,526
del Mar, world's largest        
manmade lagoon.                 

115
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:15,560
manmade lagoon.                 
It's the exact same             

116
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:16,995
It's the exact same             
crystal-clear turquoise hue     

117
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:18,130
crystal-clear turquoise hue     
of the sea.                     

118
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:19,097
of the sea.                     
So they made the pool look      

119
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,666
So they made the pool look      
just like the sea, and they     

120
00:03:20,668 --> 00:03:21,900
just like the sea, and they     
filled it with seawater.        

121
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:23,735
filled it with seawater.        
I mean, why not just go         

122
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:25,070
I mean, why not just go         
in the sea, right?              

123
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:26,304
in the sea, right?              
I mean, am I right,             

124
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:29,341
I mean, am I right,             
or am I just being a killjoy?   

125
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:30,175
or am I just being a killjoy?   
>> Ryan: A lot of people        

126
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:31,176
>> Ryan: A lot of people        
are afraid of, I don't know,    

127
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:32,244
are afraid of, I don't know,    
what they have in the sea.      

128
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:33,078
what they have in the sea.      
They could have jellyfish.      

129
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,979
They could have jellyfish.      
They could have other animals,  

130
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:34,713
They could have other animals,  
creatures--                     

131
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:35,514
creatures--                     
>> Kelly: Well, listen.         

132
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:36,381
>> Kelly: Well, listen.         
Somebody goes over there        

133
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,249
Somebody goes over there        
and grabs something over there  

134
00:03:37,251 --> 00:03:38,050
and grabs something over there  
and pulls a prank               

135
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:38,917
and pulls a prank               
and throws it in the pool,      

136
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,052
and throws it in the pool,      
it's gonna live, because        

137
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:41,853
it's gonna live, because        
it's seawater, right?           

138
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:42,888
it's seawater, right?           
>> Ryan: "Honey, I'll be        

139
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:43,622
>> Ryan: "Honey, I'll be        
right back.                     

140
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:44,523
right back.                     
I'm going to do some laps."     

141
00:03:44,525 --> 00:03:45,457
I'm going to do some laps."     
How long you think              

142
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:46,491
How long you think              
that would take, days?          

143
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:47,592
that would take, days?          
>> Kelly: I guess.              

144
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:48,693
>> Kelly: I guess.              
I mean, they've got sailboats   

145
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:49,761
I mean, they've got sailboats   
in there!                       

146
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,163
in there!                       
But we could definitely get a   

147
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:52,664
But we could definitely get a   
whole flock of these flamingos. 

148
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:53,932
whole flock of these flamingos. 
>> Ryan: Yeah.                  

149
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:55,067
>> Ryan: Yeah.                  
We could Jet Ski in there,      

150
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:57,702
We could Jet Ski in there,      
if that's legal.                

151
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:58,470
if that's legal.                
>> Kelly: I see all kinds       

152
00:03:58,472 --> 00:04:00,105
>> Kelly: I see all kinds       
of things in there.             

153
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:01,139
of things in there.             
>> Ryan: By the way, you know,  

154
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:02,174
>> Ryan: By the way, you know,  
there are some people who are   

155
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,041
there are some people who are   
afraid to swim in the ocean,    

156
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:03,875
afraid to swim in the ocean,    
and so that's a good            

157
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:04,776
and so that's a good            
alternative.                    

158
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:05,877

the flamingo for us?            
Somehow, that looks different.

and you get bonus points        
if you can slightly cross

00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:41,306
if you can slightly cross       
your knees, which helps

your knees, which helps

You know when you fall asleep

You know when you fall asleep   
in the sun and you leave

251
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:12,704
on exposed skin, soaking up     
the sun, and then they've got,

00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,472
the sun, and then they've got,

you know, the Batman logo

dangerous, though.              

257
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,413
dangerous, though.

because nobody told us,         

265
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:34,359

in my day, this, because

there was still, like, a lot    
of conflicting data

269
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:40,632
about sunscreen,                
at least in our household.      

270
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:42,033
at least in our household.

that it is in your instinct,

Sophia, to tune out the moms.

I just brushed my teeth,        

314
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:42,660
I just brushed my teeth,        
so I don't think it's--         

315
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:43,461
so I don't think it's--

Well, that's because I ate

Well, that's because I ate

My uncle, my mom's twin brother,

most of you do--most stop signs 
have a white line around them.  

943
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,210

And it took her, like,          

944
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:36,079
And it took her, like,
