1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,300
- Position for them.

2
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:04,130
- Okay, Kimberly Dozier,
thank you for the expertise.

3
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:05,234
Appreciate it.
- Thank you.

4
00:00:05,234 --> 00:00:07,817
(upbeat music)

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:13,260
- All right, it is the top of the hour.

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,340
Good Monday morning everyone,

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,450
I'm Poppy Harlow in New York.

8
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,530
Jim Sciutto has a well-deserved day off.

9
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,190
The breaking news we begin with this hour,

10
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:20,999
federal prosecutors have just unsealed

11
00:00:20,999 --> 00:00:23,860
an indictment against Jeffrey Epstein.

12
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,440
Inside it, the alarming details of how

13
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,960
the politically connected
billionaire allegedly ran

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,654
a sex-trafficking ring.

15
00:00:30,654 --> 00:00:33,280
Epstein is accused of seeking out minors,

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,172
paying cash to girls as
young as 14 years old

17
00:00:36,172 --> 00:00:38,895
to have sex with him, and then paying them

18
00:00:38,895 --> 00:00:42,190
to recruit other girls for him to abuse.

19
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:44,820
Next hour, these charges
will be announced in public,

20
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,040
a press conference will be held

21
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,145
with prosecutors and the FBI.

22
00:00:47,145 --> 00:00:50,160
And then later this morning,
Epstein will appear in court.

23
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,700
Still unknown, what this
case could reveal about

24
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,822
his political connections, and
they include a British royal,

25
00:00:56,822 --> 00:00:59,631
a former president, and the current one.

26
00:00:59,631 --> 00:01:03,700
Trump, who once called Epstein,
quote. (audio dropping)

27
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,100
We have team coverage this morning.

28
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,090
Our anchor and national
correspondent, Erica Hill,

29
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:08,450
is here with me in New York.

30
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,700
CNN crime and justice
reporter, Shimon Prokupecz,

31
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,230
is live outside of the courthouse.

32
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,380
And Shimon. (audio dropping)

33
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,820
Happening on Saturday.

34
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,885
It was planned for today.

35
00:01:19,885 --> 00:01:22,635
(audio dropping)

36
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,020
- Pointed out. (audio dropping)

37
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,843
These accounts also escalated.

38
00:04:37,157 --> 00:04:39,210
Also saying. (audio dropping)

39
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,010
In some of Julie Brown's
reporting we should point out

40
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,280
the girls who, the victims
who she spoke with,

41
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,154
the alleged victims, talking about how

42
00:04:45,154 --> 00:04:47,900
they didn't know it going
to, maybe, go that way.

43
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,900
Or they maybe knew it wasn't right

44
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,620
but they just, again, they were young.

45
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,453
They didn't get it.

46
00:04:51,453 --> 00:04:53,849
And it also points out
in the indictment that

47
00:04:53,849 --> 00:04:56,430
they believe, prosecutors
believe, he did know their age

48
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,410
and what was going on
because some of these victims

49
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,790
who are in here were asked
specifically about their age

50
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,160
and they said they didn't lie.

51
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,610
- Let's talk about the
powerful people in politics

52
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:08,790
that were friends, are/were
friends of Jeffrey Epstein.

53
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,410
Including former president Bill Clinton,

54
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,711
who, I think, records show,
flew on his jet several times.

55
00:05:13,711 --> 00:05:17,590
President Trump is
quoted with glowing words

56
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,137
about him back in 2002.

57
00:05:19,137 --> 00:05:21,130
- He is, in fact, we have that from 2002,

58
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,270
he talked about him to New York Magazine

59
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,807
saying that he's a fun guy.

60
00:05:24,807 --> 00:05:27,177
"I've known Jeff for 15
years," he said in 2002.

61
00:05:27,177 --> 00:05:28,010
"Terrific guy.

62
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,337
"He's a lot of fun to be with.

63
00:05:29,337 --> 00:05:31,127
"It's even said that he
likes beautiful women

64
00:05:31,127 --> 00:05:34,327
"as much as I do, and many of
them are on the younger side.

65
00:05:34,327 --> 00:05:37,180
"No doubt about it, Jeffrey
enjoys his social life."

66
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,930
Obviously, that's seen in a
far different light today.

67
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,470
But you're right, there
is a connection here.

68
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,020
You mentioned former
president Clinton flying

69
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:47,090
on his plane multiple times,
being on his private island.

70
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,517
President Trump reportedly
at least once on his plane.

71
00:05:49,517 --> 00:05:51,160
The two reportedly dine together.

72
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,820
At one point Epstein was
actually a member at Mar-a-Lago

73
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,460
and had been to Mar-a-Lago,
but then was barred,

74
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,630
at one point, after,
according to court records,

75
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,247
which Julie Brown also wrote about.

76
00:06:00,247 --> 00:06:02,060
He was accused of sexually assaulting

77
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,048
an underaged girl there.

78
00:06:03,048 --> 00:06:05,377
- I would be remiss not
to bring up with you

79
00:06:05,377 --> 00:06:08,370
the current Labor
Secretary, Alexander Acosta,

80
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,506
who is very tied to this.

81
00:06:09,506 --> 00:06:12,033
Because he was a big part of securing

82
00:06:12,033 --> 00:06:16,830
this sweet plea deal for
Epstein back in 2008.

83
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,933
That got him very little jail time.

84
00:06:19,933 --> 00:06:23,510
Charged with prostitution,
not sex trafficking.

85
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,805
And, by the way, that none
of the victims knew about.

86
00:06:25,805 --> 00:06:28,190
- No, they didn't, so a
couple of points there.

87
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,023
Number one, you're right.

88
00:06:29,023 --> 00:06:30,210
So Alexander Acosta, at the time,

89
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:32,070
was the US Attorney for
the Southern District.

90
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,970
So, he had to oversee this deal.

91
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,650
He had to, basically, say,
okay with a team of attorneys.

92
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:37,980
At the time, he said well, you know,

93
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,250
they lack the evidence
to prove (audio dropping)

94
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,260
violated federal law.

95
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,100
There's been a lot of
push back on that since.

96
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,120
But he, essentially,
had to sign off on it.

97
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,400
Well, the DOJ is investigating
how the case was handled.

98
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,230
We should also point out that in February

99
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,487
a federal judge said
this deal broke the law

100
00:06:51,487 --> 00:06:54,619
because, to your point,
victims didn't know about it.

101
00:06:54,619 --> 00:06:57,210
The terms of this deal, which it's

102
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,740
been said multiple times are, basically,

103
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,399
dictated by Epstein's
attorneys, powerful attorneys.

104
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,498
They didn't know about it.

105
00:07:03,498 --> 00:07:06,560
The deal was kept quiet,
kept apart from the victims,

106
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,710
until a judge had signed off for it.

107
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:11,070
You can't do that, that broke the law.

108
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,520
- Erica Hill, thank you, great reporting.

109
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,900
Obviously, you'll be on this all day

110
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,810
because he's going to be in
court later this morning.

111
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,254
Let's talk about legally where this goes.

112
00:07:17,254 --> 00:07:19,560
CNN Legal Analyst Renato Mariotti is here,

113
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,850
former federal prosecutor.

114
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,550
You're such a good voice for this because

115
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:26,502
you have actually prosecuted
sex trafficking cases before.

116
00:07:26,502 --> 00:07:28,620
One thing that Shimon said, outside

117
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,240
the courthouse moments ago, that struck me

118
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,170
is that what may be different this time,

119
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,705
than the plea deal in 2008,
if this goes to trial,

120
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:36,770
is that they have three cooperators.

121
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,480
And those are, apparently,
some of the employees

122
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,130
that arranged this travel
of these underage girls

123
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,590
to be with Epstein, et cetera.

124
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,427
How significant is that?

125
00:07:46,427 --> 00:07:48,330
- Well, it's important.

126
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,638
Frankly, I think the case
is gonna rise and fall

127
00:07:50,638 --> 00:07:52,668
for the Southern District of New York

128
00:07:52,668 --> 00:07:54,913
on the testimony of those cooperators.

129
00:07:54,913 --> 00:07:58,400
These cases are very
difficult to investigate

130
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,749
they're very difficult to prosecute.

131
00:07:59,749 --> 00:08:04,749
Often, minors who are abused
have difficulty coming forward

132
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,420
and testifying.

133
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:11,500
They have difficulty,
essentially, going through

134
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,280
and doing what they would need to do

135
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,880
to be a witness in a case.

136
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,275
Really, here, the testimony
of the cooperators

137
00:08:18,275 --> 00:08:21,920
has to be strong in order
for the Southern District

138
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,945
to make it's case in court.

139
00:08:22,945 --> 00:08:25,508
What I think this indictment tell us

140
00:08:25,508 --> 00:08:27,812
is the the Southern District believes

141
00:08:27,812 --> 00:08:31,433
that they have testimony that
can back these charges up.

142
00:08:32,707 --> 00:08:36,263
- When you look at the
deal that was struck

143
00:08:36,263 --> 00:08:39,370
that raised so many questions,

144
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:41,130
that the victims didn't know about.

145
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,310
What do you think the
questions are going to be now?

146
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:45,970
Not only for Alexander Acosta,
the current Labor Secretary

147
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,840
who was a big part of this, but the judge

148
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,993
who signed off on it.

149
00:08:50,436 --> 00:08:54,590
- I have to say, there are
very significant questions

150
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:58,033
about Mr. Acosta's actions there.

151
00:08:58,033 --> 00:09:00,440
Really, there has to be something

152
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,640
very significant behind
the scenes that caused

153
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,330
that series of events.

154
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:09,661
There's clearly misconduct
by not informing victims.

155
00:09:09,661 --> 00:09:12,690
It appears, at some point,
there was misrepresentations

156
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,990
that were made to the court.

157
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:17,976
Very serious misconduct by
Justice Department attorneys.

158
00:09:17,976 --> 00:09:20,610
Victims need to know,
particularly in cases like this.

159
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:23,044
When I did investigate
human trafficking cases

160
00:09:23,044 --> 00:09:26,519
and sexual abuse cases of minors,
those victims are counting

161
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:28,500
on you, as a prosecutor.

162
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,190
They have a right to have access to you,

163
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,440
they have a right to be heard.

164
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,440
They are counting on you to
prosecute and act fairly.

165
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:37,483
- And it is interesting that

166
00:09:37,483 --> 00:09:39,260
the federal prosecutors working on this,

167
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,740
that are going to hold
this press conference

168
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,649
in a little under an hour, are from

169
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:45,414
the Southern District of New
York's Public Corruption Unit.

170
00:09:45,414 --> 00:09:46,773
What does that tell you?

171
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,050
- It could be a coincidence, it could be

172
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,830
they just have time on their plates.

173
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:54,760
But it also could mean
that there is some tie

174
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,062
to this case, either from the
angle you just talked about

175
00:09:57,062 --> 00:09:59,150
or another, there's an obstruction,

176
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,152
potential obstruction provision.

177
00:10:01,152 --> 00:10:04,540
Perhaps there is a public
official that could,

178
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,252
that is at least tangentially
involved in this case

179
00:10:06,252 --> 00:10:08,027
and could become part of it later on.

180
00:10:08,027 --> 00:10:11,190
- Interesting, all really
important questions

181
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,023
to be answered.

182
00:10:12,023 --> 00:10:13,088
Renata Mariotti, thank you so much.

183
00:10:13,088 --> 00:10:15,745
Also this morning, as more images

184
00:10:15,745 --> 00:10:18,470
and reports come out
of inhumane conditions

185
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,400
at these migrant
detention facilities along

186
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,370
the southern border, the president says

187
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:26,350
he now wants the media to go
inside and see for themselves.

188
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,730
With me now is our Kaitlan Collins

189
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:28,990
she joins us from the White House

190
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,910
and Natasha Chen in El Paso, Texas.

191
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:31,790
good morning to you both.

192
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:34,760
Kaitlan, the president says he wants this

193
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,480
but there is a big difference
between saying that

194
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,710
and then the facilities
actually letting in journalists

195
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,261
with cameras unannounced.

196
00:10:40,261 --> 00:10:42,370
- Yeah, and so far they've
been pretty hesitant,

197
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,241
even not wanting lawmakers
to bring their phones

198
00:10:44,241 --> 00:10:45,860
into those facilities.

199
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,360
Of course, there are children there.

200
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,270
So, whether or not that
invitation is actually going

201
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:51,510
to go forward is still an open question.

202
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,160
But so far, the president and his aides

203
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,960
have been downplaying the reports

204
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,790
about these conditions at the border.

205
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,090
Here's what the president said when he was

206
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,390
on his way back to the
White House, yesterday.

207
00:11:01,909 --> 00:11:06,133
- I'm gonna start showing some
of these detention centers

208
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:07,144
to the press.

209
00:11:07,144 --> 00:11:09,370
We're gonna have of the
press go in and see it

210
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:12,260
because they're crowded,
and we're the ones

211
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,966
who were complaining
about they're crowded.

212
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:16,920
- So, the president there going after,

213
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,700
not only some of those
Democratic lawmakers

214
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,310
who have been reporting what they saw

215
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,840
when they've toured these facilities.

216
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,710
But Poppy, we should note, it's not just

217
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:26,236
any one, singular report
detailing these conditions

218
00:11:26,236 --> 00:11:29,210
that they say are widespread
at these facilities.

219
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:32,640
Conditions like overcrowding,
some standing-room-only areas.

220
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,450
People going without hot meals.

221
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,760
But not only just from Democrats

222
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,900
it's coming from a report from

223
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,300
the president's own government.

224
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,710
And a highly detailed
and very specific report

225
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,500
in The New York Times
that came out yesterday

226
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,990
and that people should read
if they haven't seen it yet.

227
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:45,970
- They absolutely should.

228
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,240
And Natasha, you're there and you spoke

229
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,417
to a Texas State Rep who
says Border Patrol agents

230
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:52,252
have been trying for some time

231
00:11:52,252 --> 00:11:54,800
to bring light to the conditions in Clint.

232
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,560
Which is probably why a number of them

233
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,878
were willing to speak to The Times.

234
00:11:59,878 --> 00:12:01,880
- Well, that's right Poppy.

235
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,820
We were talking to
Representative Mary E. Gonzales,

236
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,776
she represents the Clint
area where that facility is.

237
00:12:07,776 --> 00:12:10,592
She says that local leaders
like herself in the community

238
00:12:10,592 --> 00:12:14,062
did not even know that children,
unaccompanied children,

239
00:12:14,062 --> 00:12:16,810
were being processed
through that facility,

240
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,439
until news reports came
out in the last month or so

241
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:21,589
about the conditions inside.

242
00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:23,755
She said, some of these
Border Patrol agents

243
00:12:23,755 --> 00:12:26,196
who live in this community,
who have known her

244
00:12:26,196 --> 00:12:28,776
for a long time, they have
been telling her about

245
00:12:28,776 --> 00:12:32,987
how demoralizing and depressing
it is to work right now

246
00:12:32,987 --> 00:12:34,815
in those conditions, because of what they

247
00:12:34,815 --> 00:12:37,800
are seeing day to day with the migrants.

248
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,360
They've also told her about
how hundreds of children

249
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,560
at one point, were being
processed through that facility

250
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,220
in a space that's really not
designed for that many kids.

251
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,870
And being held there for longer
than they should be there

252
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:53,529
with limited shower and
shower facilities to wash up,

253
00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:57,020
limited microwaves to
heat food to feed them.

254
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,206
Here's what she had to say about

255
00:12:58,206 --> 00:13:01,730
her conversations with these agents.

256
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:04,230
- A lot of the people I
talked to who worked there

257
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,970
were saying, we have
been telling higher-ups

258
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,220
there's a problem.

259
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:11,003
And basically, those
pleas have been ignored.

260
00:13:11,003 --> 00:13:12,693
A lot of the people who I talked to

261
00:13:12,693 --> 00:13:14,965
have been in the Border
Patrol for decades,

262
00:13:14,965 --> 00:13:19,530
23 years 24 years, this is
something very new to them.

263
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:22,580
They were never charged with
being caretakers of children.

264
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,460
At the end of the day, we have to realize

265
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,240
that my community is struggling with

266
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,833
a administration-made problem.

267
00:13:32,095 --> 00:13:36,220
- And Gonzales did say that
she got to visit inside

268
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,920
the Clint facility last week when there

269
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,810
were far fewer children.

270
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,741
Many of them have now been processed out.

271
00:13:41,741 --> 00:13:44,030
We did also hear from the Sector Chief

272
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,024
of this El Paso region today, who said,

273
00:13:46,024 --> 00:13:50,820
now in this region they have
only 26 children in custody.

274
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:55,150
He disputes the reports of the
inhumane conditions inside.

275
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,593
But he does acknowledge
it's very possible agents

276
00:13:57,593 --> 00:13:59,903
have been complaining about conditions

277
00:13:59,903 --> 00:14:01,850
and overcrowding in the past.

278
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:04,080
He says, they've all been complaining

279
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,220
that there are just too many children

280
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,288
and not enough resources
to process them through.

281
00:14:09,288 --> 00:14:11,910
- Thank you so much for the
reporting, for talking to her.

282
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:12,768
Natasha Chen, we appreciate

283
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:15,090
and Caitlin Collins at the White House.

284
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:15,923
All right, still to come.

285
00:14:15,923 --> 00:14:17,618
The Department of Justice
is taking a new strategy

286
00:14:17,618 --> 00:14:20,905
as it pushes again to try to
get a citizenship question

287
00:14:20,905 --> 00:14:22,351
on the upcoming census.

288
00:14:22,351 --> 00:14:23,506
We'll talk about that.

289
00:14:23,506 --> 00:14:27,630
Plus, new fighting words
within the Democratic Party.

290
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,335
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi takes

291
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:32,380
on Congresswoman Alexander Ocasio-Cortez.

292
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,798
And later, the US women are heading home

293
00:14:34,798 --> 00:14:37,380
with another World Cup title and ready

294
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,910
to take on a bigger battle, equal pay.

295
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,505
(upbeat music)

296
00:14:43,505 --> 00:14:45,568

298

00:14:56,733 --> 00:14:59,962

00:15:11,659 --> 00:15:13,435
GEICO could save you 15%
or more on car insurance.

310
00:15:13,435 --> 00:15:14,885
(T-Mobile chimes ringing)

311
00:15:14,885 --> 00:15:17,540
- [Announcer] Have a discount
with another wireless carrier?

312
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,280
T-mobile will match it.

313
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,000
Need a few more reasons to switch?

314
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,540
One, do you like Netflix?

315
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,120
Sure you do that's why it's on us.

316

Three, no surprises on your bill

318
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,280

- [Announcer] Unlike ordinary diapers,

336
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,750

who both promised great results.

344
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,453
But after almost a year on the market

345
00:16:50,453 --> 00:16:53,060
we still hadn't sold our house.

346
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,730

We went with the agent they
recommended and it worked.

- And this is her husband Josh.

388
00:18:46,884 --> 00:18:47,910
- Hello.

389
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,340
- Josh is in the military
and he's deployed a lot.

390
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,970
- Must be had with a family.

391
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:54,450
- It is, but since we
installed Ring in our home

392
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,610
I feel much more at peace.

393

Plus, it saves us a ton of money.

394

- And I like that Ring
is keeping my family safe

while I'm away, so thank you guys.

396
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,147
- No, thank you for keeping us all safe.

401
00:19:14,094 --> 00:19:16,480
- [Announcer] "Apollo 13" was
a real turning point for me.

402
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,080
- Houston, we have a problem.

403
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,240
- I learned the power of a true story.

404
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,280
How an audience begin to lean in when

405
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,523
they know you're dealing with the truth.

406
00:19:30,797 --> 00:19:33,420
- All right, new team, new argument.

407
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,940
After the Supreme Court ruled against

408
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,330
the Trump administration's attempt

409
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:39,392
to add a citizenship
question to the census.

410
00:19:39,392 --> 00:19:41,990
This morning, the Justice Department says

411
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,993
a different team of lawyers
will now take up this battle.

412
00:19:44,993 --> 00:19:47,810
For more on why, Jessica Schneider,

413
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:49,320
our Justice Correspondent, is here in DC.

414
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,001
So, this is even after the
Supreme Court ruled against

415
00:19:51,001 --> 00:19:52,370
them in this.

416
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:53,664
The administration sees
it as that important

417
00:19:53,664 --> 00:19:56,100
that they're putting a new
team of attorneys on this.

418
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,730
What does it mean and why does it matter?

419
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,563
- That's right Poppy.

420
00:19:58,563 --> 00:20:00,210
So, this will be a new team that will now

421
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,820
have to push a completely
different set of arguments

422
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,480
to try to get this citizenship
question on the 2020 census.

423
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,870
And we've learned that
the political appointee

424
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,674
who led the initial team of lawyers did

425
00:20:10,674 --> 00:20:13,260
in fact, think that it made sense to get

426
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,485
a new team of lawyers on board because

427
00:20:15,485 --> 00:20:17,930
they are really doing an about-face here.

428
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,790
It's a flip-flop that seems to

429
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,210
have been forced by the president.

430
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:23,280
Because, remember, it
was less than a week ago

431
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,960
that this fight seemed to be over.

432
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,860
Lawyers from the DOJ's
Federal Programs branch,

433
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,019
told the challengers to
the citizenship question

434
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:32,704
that the census was going to print without

435
00:20:32,704 --> 00:20:34,144
the controversial question.

436
00:20:34,144 --> 00:20:36,516
And then, those lawyers told a judge

437
00:20:36,516 --> 00:20:38,740
that the decision was final.

438
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,930
But then, of course, we
saw that flurry of Tweets

439
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:43,526
from the president and he
insisted that he would push

440
00:20:43,526 --> 00:20:47,230
his administration to find
a way to add this question.

441
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,703
Now, DOJ lawyers admitted, just last week,

442
00:20:49,703 --> 00:20:52,107
to a Maryland judge in
a hearing on Wednesday

443
00:20:52,107 --> 00:20:54,350
that they were really blindsided by

444
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,510
the president's tweets, here.

445
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:58,730
Especially since the DOJ
has been insisting all along

446
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:01,487
that a July 1st deadline
to print this census

447
00:21:01,487 --> 00:21:04,720
was the absolute drop-dead deadline.

448
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,310
And now, all indications are that the DOJ

449
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,770
is continuing to press forward to find

450
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:12,150
a rationale to add this question.

451
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:14,220
Poppy, it is possible, I mean,

452
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,515
the Supreme Court said,
when they made that ruling,

453
00:21:16,515 --> 00:21:18,700
that if the Justice Department

454
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,096
and the Census Bureau went back

455
00:21:20,096 --> 00:21:22,774
and provided some sort
of rationale, possibly,

456
00:21:22,774 --> 00:21:24,810
this question could be added.

457
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,710
But really, it seems the administration

458
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:28,110
is running out of time here.

459
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:31,570
They've already gone past
their own July 1st deadline.

460
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:33,670
Now, they could continue
to push it forward

461
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:36,200
but who knows if they would
even have time to add it.

462
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,033
Poppy.

463
00:21:37,033 --> 00:21:38,238
- You know, just your
point, not to mention,

464
00:21:38,238 --> 00:21:40,920
you know, if they come up with
a completely new rationale

465
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,270
and reasoning, what will
mean for Wilbur Ross's,

466
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,297
the Commerce Secretary's testimony.

467
00:21:45,297 --> 00:21:48,208
When he talked about the
rationale, et cetera.

468
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:50,750
I guess if they win on this,
what are they going to put?

469
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,970
Like an insert in the census for everyone?

470
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,940
I mean, actually, how would this play out?

471
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,410
- Right, so logistically, that's sort of

472
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:57,640
the big question here.

473
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,850
The census, we know from DOJ officials,

474
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:02,460
it has gone to print
without that question.

475
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,235
But could the administration somehow

476
00:22:04,235 --> 00:22:06,970
add on a citizenship question, by maybe,

477
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:09,663
adding supplemental pages,
supplemental questionnaires?

478
00:22:09,663 --> 00:22:11,560
You know, the president has floated

479
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,093
the idea, even of an executive order

480
00:22:13,093 --> 00:22:15,850
to mandate that this question be added.

481
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:17,347
But all of these options, Poppy,

482
00:22:17,347 --> 00:22:20,710
they're sure to face these
continued legal fights.

483
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,299
We're already seeing it on two fronts

484
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:25,540
in federal courts in New
York and Maryland here.

485
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,040
And of course, we're running out of time

486
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,469
because we're less than
six months away from 2020

487
00:22:29,469 --> 00:22:31,370
and the census needs to get out.

Poppy.

489
00:22:32,203 --> 00:22:34,210
- Okay, Jessica Schneider,
thank you so much.

490
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:36,450
Ahead for us, new
attacks on Nancy Pelosi's

491
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:37,504
leadership style.

492
00:22:37,504 --> 00:22:41,320
Will the speaker win out
in this latest new school,

493
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,133
old school battle?

494
00:22:43,133 --> 00:22:47,504
(dramatic orchestral music)

495
00:22:47,504 --> 00:22:50,087

when no one carries cash.

508

- Sun care is self care.

513
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:51,081
I used to not love wearing an SPF

514
00:23:51,081 --> 00:23:54,290
just because I felt like
it was so oily and greasy.

515
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:56,920
But with Olay Regenerist with SPF 25

516
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,000
it's so lightweight, I love it.

517
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,190
I'm busy Phillips and I'm
fearless to face anything.

518
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,430
- I switched to MiraLAX
for my constipation.

519
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:06,720
Stimulant laxatives forcefully
stimulate the nerves

520
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,580
in your colon.

521
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,330
MiraLAX works with the water in your body

522
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:11,060
to unblock your system naturally.

523
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,070
And it doesn't cause
bloating, cramping, gas

524
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,219
or sudden urgency.

525
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:16,643

you could've fixed it with a pen.

Maybe you should take that pen

553
00:25:19,739 --> 00:25:22,350
Today we take a stroll down memory lane

554
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:25,680
to see how these other OTC
medicines compare to XYZAL

the latest in 24 hour allergy relief.

556
00:25:28,001 --> 00:25:31,470
You see, XYZAL lasts up to
six times longer than Bendryl.

557
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,170
Works faster than Claritin.

558
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:35,323
And on first dose, provides
the same relief as Zyrtec

at nearly half the size.

560

it's just as effective at
hour 24 as at hour one.

606
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,582
Freshman Congresswoman
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez

607
00:27:29,582 --> 00:27:32,113
is hitting back at Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

608
00:27:32,113 --> 00:27:35,127
Pelosi criticized her and
three other far-left Democrats

609
00:27:35,127 --> 00:27:38,734
for voting against that
measure for border funding

610
00:27:38,734 --> 00:27:41,540
that eventually passed
for those facilities,

611
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,382
those detention facilities.

612
00:27:42,382 --> 00:27:45,967
Pelosi told the New York
Times in an interview quote,

613
00:27:45,967 --> 00:27:47,967
"All of these people have
their public whatever

614
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:49,688
"and their Twitter world.

615
00:27:49,688 --> 00:27:51,287
"But they didn't have any following.

616
00:27:51,287 --> 00:27:54,240
"They're four people and that's
how many votes they got."

617
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,960
So, Ocasio-Cortez taking
to, what else, Twitter,

618
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,390
to fire back, calling Pelosi's decision

619
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:02,510
to quote, "Blindly trust the White House."

620
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,420
Quote, "A big mistake."

621

00:28:10,173 --> 00:28:11,006
Good morning to you both.

626
00:28:11,006 --> 00:28:13,570
Tiffany, let me just begin with you.

627
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:15,840
I mean, ideologically, these two,

628
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,930
they're in the same party,
but ideologically on this

629
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:20,170
they could not be more divided.

630
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:21,750
I do think it's interesting, though,

631
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,599
that Nancy Pelosi has
also said in the midst

632
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:26,003
of all of this, criticizing the media.

633
00:28:26,003 --> 00:28:27,820
Saying, you know, you're focusing too much

634
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:30,635
on division in the
party, than on the issue

635
00:28:30,635 --> 00:28:32,360
at the southern border.

636
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,730
We're focusing a lot on the
issue at the southern border.

637
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:37,216
But, how significant is this divide?

638
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:39,920
- Well, I take the Pelosi's point,

639
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,470
that I do think there is this, you know,

640
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:43,900
continual drive that
Democrats are out of step.

641
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,650
But, listen, this is a healthy,

642
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:48,200
generational shift
happening within the party.

643
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,270
And, quite frankly, I do, I'm not here

644
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,590
to beat up on Nancy
Pelosi, I think that she's,

645
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:54,250
you know, achieved some
congressional feats

646
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,800
in her tenure, of course.

647
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,170
But I do think, in this instance,

648
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:59,660
that she did look a bit
out of step with her party.

649
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,310
If you remember, Poppy, at the time

650
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:03,350
when she was going through campaigning

651
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,070
and trying to be House Speaker again

652
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,870
and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley,

653
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,280
one of the people who didn't vote for

654
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,020
the border funding bill said,
I'm going to vote for you

655
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,650
but I did not come here to ask
for your permission to lead.

656
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:16,040
And this is what she
is reckoning with now.

657
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:19,790
These four women are not
diversity hall decoration

658
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:22,780
for Congress, but they are
lawmakers intending to legislate

659
00:29:24,305 --> 00:29:25,718
and vote their conscience, rather,

660
00:29:25,718 --> 00:29:27,186
and reflect the views
of their constituency.

661
00:29:27,186 --> 00:29:29,180
This is a major defeat for her because

662
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,570
she's used to being
able to whip her caucus

663
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:31,906
and keep people in step.

664
00:29:31,906 --> 00:29:33,879
But, as this generational shift happens

665
00:29:33,879 --> 00:29:36,603
you're going to see this kind
of discord on these occasions.

666
00:29:36,603 --> 00:29:38,923
And I don't think that's
a bad thing for the party.

667
00:29:38,923 --> 00:29:41,960
- So Molly, it's interesting the line

668
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,510
that really struck us in
the Dowd piece in the Times.

669
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:47,047
From Pelosi quote, "If
the left doesn't think

670
00:29:47,047 --> 00:29:49,533
"I'm left enough, so be it."

671
00:29:49,533 --> 00:29:50,500
Will that work for her?

672
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,569
Is that fine or will
she have to answer more

673
00:29:52,569 --> 00:29:55,600
and more calls from the left?

674
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,510
- Well, we'll see.

675
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,947
I think that she's going
to be increasingly tested

676
00:29:58,947 --> 00:30:00,850
by these divisions within the caucus.

677
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:02,810
We're going to see this week as

678
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:05,066
the debate heats up over Pentagon funding,

679
00:30:05,066 --> 00:30:08,530
whether she can keep those
Liberal members in the tent.

680
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:10,500
Her tactic has always been to, sort of,

681
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,770
use the left to triangulate.

682
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:15,520
Because she identifies as a Liberal.

683
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,580
Because she's from one of
the most Liberal districts

684
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,420
in the country.

685
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,140
Even though she is not nearly, I think,

686
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:22,801
as Liberal as her
district in San Francisco.

687
00:30:22,801 --> 00:30:26,566
She has always, sort of,
especially since Republicans

688
00:30:26,566 --> 00:30:30,150
have spent hundreds of millions
of dollars portraying her

689
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:32,562
as the epitome of San
Francisco Liberalism.

690
00:30:32,562 --> 00:30:34,947
She then takes that and says,
well, they call me a Liberal,

691
00:30:34,947 --> 00:30:37,490
I guess I am, that means
that I'm on your side.

692
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:41,030
But, this is the most we
can get done practically.

693
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:44,340
I don't think this is really
an ideological division

694
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,780
so much as a tactical one.

695
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:48,980
And what Speaker Pelosi is saying is,

696
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:53,230
I understand that you have these ideas

697
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,860
but are you working within the system?

698
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,110
Are you working with in the process?

699
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:58,029
So she's saying, you may
have support out there

700
00:30:58,029 --> 00:31:00,231
on Twitter or in the real world,

701
00:31:00,231 --> 00:31:03,110
do you have support in the conference?

702
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,160
And that's what we're going to see

703
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,059
is are these Liberals
willing to play hardball

704
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:07,640
with the leadership?

705
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,880
Are they going to make Nancy
Pelosi's life more difficult?

706
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,570
Because although there
was a lot of complaining

707
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,450
about that border bill, Nancy Pelosi

708
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:16,520
did get her version through the House.

709
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,550
And then she did get the
Senate bill through the House.

710
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,108
- [Poppy] That's true.

711
00:31:20,108 --> 00:31:21,878
- Can I just push back
really quickly, Poppy?

712
00:31:21,878 --> 00:31:22,711
- Of course, yep.

713
00:31:22,711 --> 00:31:23,960
- I hear you Molly, I completely agree.

714
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,240
But, I do think this
actually is an ideological

715
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,995
and a tactical division
within these women.

716
00:31:28,995 --> 00:31:30,960
They're, all four, women of color

717
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,269
who voted against this bill.

718
00:31:32,269 --> 00:31:36,030
The reality that, I think,
there's trouble reconciling

719
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:37,524
within this country is, if these

720
00:31:37,524 --> 00:31:40,290
were white babies being treated this way

721
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:41,540
in these detention facilities.

722
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,382
If these were white women being held

723
00:31:43,382 --> 00:31:46,950
in overcrowded facilities being
told to drink from toilets.

724
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:49,600
There certainly would be
more of a national outcry.

725
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,280
I think that's so important and resonating

726
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,530
with these four women who said,

727
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:55,261
we cannot trust this administration.

728
00:31:55,261 --> 00:31:57,820
And there's been continual evidence

729
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:00,550
of Donald Trump misusing funds.

730
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:01,700
I mean, we just saw in July 4th.

731
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,523
But as a candidate and as a president

732
00:32:03,523 --> 00:32:05,160
he has misused funds.

733
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,700
So, I think there is something
about these women saying,

734
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,740
why would we blindly trust this man?

735
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:12,000
Why would we allow ICE
to have more funding.

736
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,280
We just found out today that ICE

737
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,509
is using facial recognition technology.

738
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:17,514
Well, states haven't
passed laws to allow that.

739
00:32:17,514 --> 00:32:20,280
Undocumented immigrants,
when they signed up

740
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,370
they didn't know that they were turning

741
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:22,738
their information over to ICE.

742
00:32:22,738 --> 00:32:23,980
I think these are relevant issues.

743
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,926
- You're referencing the
Washington Post reporting

744
00:32:25,926 --> 00:32:28,620
that says that ICE has been
using facial recognition

745
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,270
technology to scan photos at the DMV

746
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,950
of driver's licenses, even of people

747
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:35,340
not accused of committing crimes.

748
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,870
And that raises a whole host
of other questions, certainly.

749
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:41,615
Molly, I found this attack,
actually, on Nancy Pelosi

750
00:32:41,615 --> 00:32:44,220
from former Republican, now independent,

751
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:46,259
Congressman Justin Amash of Michigan.

752
00:32:46,259 --> 00:32:49,509
(emergency alert tone)

753
00:33:05,322 --> 00:33:06,500
- [Announcer] We interrupt this program

754
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,430
to activate the Emergency Alert System

755
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:11,254
for the Washington, DC
Metropolitan Operational Area

756
00:33:11,254 --> 00:33:13,597
because of a local weather emergency.

757
00:33:13,597 --> 00:33:15,920
- [Female Announcer] The
National Weather Service

758
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,655
in Sterling, Virginia has now extended

759
00:33:17,655 --> 00:33:19,384

the city of Falls Church and
northeastern Fairfax county

00:33:31,705 --> 00:33:35,163
until 1:45 this afternoon.

flash flooding across the

767
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,950
even though the heavy rain has ended.

768
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:46,906
Three to five inches of rain
fell earlier across the area.

769
00:33:46,906 --> 00:33:49,071
Many waterways are still rapidly rising

770
00:33:49,071 --> 00:33:51,340
with ongoing flash flooding.

771
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,500
The flash flood warning is extended now,

772
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,930

(emergency alert tones)

780
00:34:30,794 --> 00:34:32,890
- [Poppy] World Cup title
for US Women's Soccer.

781
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:35,740
Now, their fight at home
is an even bigger one,

782
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:39,503
a fight for equal pay.
(people cheering)

783
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:43,230
- I'm Chris Cuomo, let's get after it.

784
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:45,680
- [Announcer] Tonight, former
Vice President Joe Biden

785
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,713
and his wife Jill join Chris.

786
00:34:46,713 --> 00:34:49,010
A revealing look at the candidate.

787
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:51,290
- The one thing you cannot say about Joe

788
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:52,650
is that he's a racist.

789
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:56,080
- [CNN Announcer] Cuomo Prime
Time, tonight, nine Eastern.

790
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,355
- [Announcer] How do you
gauge the greatness of an SUV?

791
00:34:58,355 --> 00:35:02,569
Is it to carry cargo or
to carry on a legacy?

792
00:35:02,569 --> 00:35:06,932
Its show of strength, or
its sign of intelligence.

793
00:35:06,932 --> 00:35:10,538
In crossing harsh terrain
or breaking new ground.

794
00:35:10,538 --> 00:35:13,480
This is the time to get
an exceptional offer

795
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,080
on the Mercedes of your midsummer dreams

796
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,377
at the Mercedes-Benz
Summer Event, going on now.

797
00:35:17,377 --> 00:35:20,730
Lease the GLA 250 SUV for just 329 a month

798
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:22,630
at the Mercedes-Benz Summer Event.

799
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:25,674
Mercedes-Benz, the best or nothing.

800
00:35:25,674 --> 00:35:28,641
- My experience with
USAA has been excellent.

801
00:35:28,641 --> 00:35:30,457
They really appreciate military family

802
00:35:30,457 --> 00:35:32,110
and it really shows.

803
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:34,740
- With all that USAA offers,
why go with anybody else?

804
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,070
We know their rates are good.

805
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,970
We know that they're always
gonna take care of us.

806
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,750
- It was a instant savings
and I should've changed

807
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:40,583
a long time ago.

808
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:42,270
- It was funny, because we would call

809
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:44,350
another insurance company, they would say,

810
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,830
oh, we can't be USAA.

811
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:46,783
- We're the Weber family's.

812
00:35:46,783 --> 00:35:47,689
- We're the Tenny's.

813
00:35:47,689 --> 00:35:50,503
- We're the Hail's and
we're USAA members for life.

814

- [Announcer] Get your USAA
auto insurance quote, today.

815
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,120
- [Woman Announcer] Did you know Congress

816
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,187
is working to end
surprise medical billing?

817
00:35:59,187 --> 00:36:01,780
That's when patients are
hit with medical bills

818
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:04,090
they thought would be
covered by insurance.

819
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:06,250
The problem is, big
insurance companies want

820
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:09,370
a one-size-fits-all approach,
that let's them decide

821
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:11,390
what they'll pay doctors for your care.

822
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:13,860
Letting insurance companies decide means

823
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:16,220
it could be harder for you
to see the best doctors

824
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,486
when you need them the most.

825
00:36:17,486 --> 00:36:20,075
Tell Congress, end surprise billing

826
00:36:20,075 --> 00:36:21,870
and don't let insurance companies

827
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:23,620
put profits over patients.

828
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,910
Paid for by Physicians for Fair Coverage.

829
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:27,280
- [Announcer] It's only a matter of time

830
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,080
until your check engine light comes on

831
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,690
or worse yet, your car needs repair.

832
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:34,350
That could mean a big
surprise auto repair bill.

833
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:36,610
Those repairs are more
expensive than ever.

834
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:38,821
A new engine can be over $5,000.

835
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:41,740
A new transmission over $4,000.

836
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:45,020
That's why it's so important
you call CarShield today.

837
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:47,770
CarShield is the number
one auto protection company

838
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:48,940
in the country.

839
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,718
- I like CarShield because
they were reliable,

840
00:36:51,718 --> 00:36:54,712
they were affordable and
they were trustworthy.

841
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:57,380
- Well, I think everybody
should have CarShield.

842
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,879
Once your manufacturer's
warranty has expired

843
00:36:59,879 --> 00:37:02,140
there's just no big bills.

844
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,554
We needed repairs,
CarShield was there for us.

845
00:37:04,554 --> 00:37:06,310
- [Announcer] Now it's your turn to get

00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,140

851
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:21,580
So, if your car is 20 years old or newer,

852
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,950

In a matter of minutes you can be covered.

855
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:29,740
- I was elated that I had CarShield.

856
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,177
I was more than happy.

857
00:37:31,177 --> 00:37:33,520
- There's no fun when you
have a car and it's broken

858
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,300
and you can't pay for it to get it fixed.

859
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,950
- [Announcer] Here's how CarShield works.

860
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,980
When your car needs repair, you take it

861
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,677
to your favorite mechanic
or even your dealer

862
00:37:40,677 --> 00:37:43,670
and CarShield gets them paid directly.

863
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:46,210
That's why CarShield
is America's number one

864
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:47,770
auto protection provider.

865
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:50,534
- CarShield is just the best
thing to take away the fear

866
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:52,580
that when something is going to go wrong

867
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:55,145
with your car, because
it will, and CarShield

868
00:37:55,145 --> 00:37:56,940
is gonna be there to back you up.

869
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,010
- My experience with CarShield is that

870
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,400
they absolutely come through,
every time I need them.

871
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,580
- If my car breaks down,
I can count on CarShield

872
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,870

873
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:07,540

Call 1-800-259-9374.

900
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,543
(upbeat music)

901
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,670
- All right, this just in to CNN.

902
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:18,941
New York Governor, Andrew
Cuomo, has just signed a law

903
00:39:18,941 --> 00:39:21,008
that would allow Congress to get a hold

904
00:39:21,008 --> 00:39:23,984
of President Trump's state tax returns.

905
00:39:23,984 --> 00:39:26,950
Of course, this comes
amid the escalating fight

906
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:29,380
with top administration
officials and Congress,

907
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:32,110
trying to get the president's
federal tax returns.

908
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:34,673
We'll see how this develops.

909
00:39:36,334 --> 00:39:38,000
- Equal pay.
- Equal pay.

910
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,483
- Equal pay.
- Equal pay.

911
00:39:39,483 --> 00:39:41,530
- Equal pay.
- Equal pay.

912
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:43,550
- Well fans chanted equal pay as

913
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:46,380
the Women's National Team
received their World Cup medals

914
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,819
after their second straight win on Sunday.

915
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:52,131
The team is suing the US Soccer
Federation over their pay

916
00:39:52,131 --> 00:39:56,610
and their star is speaking out
about that suit this morning.

917
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:58,380
Andy Scholes joins us with more.

918
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,300
So much to celebrate there
Andy, such a big win.

919
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,170
But I would argue the bigger fight now,

920
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:04,380
for them, is at home.

921
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:06,020
- Yeah, that could be true, Poppy.

922
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,620
But I'll tell you what,
if there was ever a team

923
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:10,170
that symbolized talking the
talk and then walking the walk

924
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:12,940
it is certainly this US
Women's National Team.

925
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:14,157
What we just witnessed from them was just

926
00:40:14,157 --> 00:40:15,620
an incredible performance.

927
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,770
They had so much going on off the field.

928
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:20,160
The fight for equal pay,
Megan Rapinoe's back and forth

929
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,290
with President Trump.

930
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:24,110
But this team's still
able to put it all aside

931
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,630
and go out there and prove, once again,

932
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,930
that they are the best team in the world.

933
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:29,760
Team USA beating the
Netherlands, two to nothing,

934
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,230
yesterday in the final.

935
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:33,490
They're on their way back
to the US, right now,

936
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:35,370
after leaving France earlier this morning.

937
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:37,066
Here's a pretty cool
pic they took together

938
00:40:37,066 --> 00:40:39,080
before boarding their plane.

939
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,530
They're gonna arrive at Newark Airport

940
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:42,130
at about 4:15 Eastern.

941
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:44,720
They're gonna have a parade
Wednesday morning in New York.

942
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,794
Before leaving France, Rapinoe was asked,

943
00:40:46,794 --> 00:40:49,550
how their dominant performance will affect

944
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:51,664
the US Federation's argument against them

945
00:40:51,664 --> 00:40:53,513
in their Equal Pay lawsuit.

946
00:40:54,539 --> 00:40:58,049
- It's not good for
them, is it. (laughing)

947
00:40:58,049 --> 00:41:01,590
I mean, I think obviously, it's huge.

948
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:06,220
I think we've been a
little shy to say that,

949
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,890
you know, putting so much
pressure on ourselves

950
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:09,860
because I think we have
a case no matter what.

951
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,880
Obviously, we brought the lawsuit.

952
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,037
But this just, you know, sort
of blows it out of the water.

953
00:41:15,037 --> 00:41:17,230
It's like, is it even about that anymore?

954
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:19,323
Or is it just, kind of
about doing the right thing.

955
00:41:19,323 --> 00:41:22,370
I think the Federation
is in a unique position

956
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:26,170
to, you know, kind of ride
this wave of good fortune

957
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:28,610
and get on board, and
hopefully, set things right

958
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:29,665
for the future.

959
00:41:29,665 --> 00:41:31,610
- Yeah, the players and
the US Soccer Federation

960
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:33,980
will head to mediation
sometime soon, over pay.

961
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,878
Over the past three
years, the women's team

962
00:41:35,878 --> 00:41:38,360
has made more revenue than the men,

963
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,410
despite being paid less.

964
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:43,150
That being said, the men didn't
make the World Cup last year

965
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:45,030
and the money difference in
the World Cup is staggering.

966
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:48,720
The Men's World Cup in Russia
last year made $6,000,000,000

967
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,372
in revenue and paid out
400 million to the teams.

968
00:41:51,372 --> 00:41:53,568
The Women's World Cup, meanwhile,
is expected to generate

969
00:41:53,568 --> 00:41:56,080
only about 130 million in revenue, total.

970
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,160
Paying out 30 million to the teams.

971
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,738
There's no question, the women's team

972
00:41:59,738 --> 00:42:02,280
is more successful than
the men here in the US.

973
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,160
We all know their names,
they sell more jerseys.

974
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,110
But, right now, there's still just

975
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:07,833
so much more money in men's soccer.

976
00:42:07,833 --> 00:42:09,670
We're gonna have to wait and see, Poppy,

977
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:11,770
if the US Soccer
Federation decides to give

978
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:12,670
the women a pay raise.

979
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:13,970
They certainly deserve it, after

980
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:15,370
a fourth World Cup title.

981
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:16,883
But in the past, the Federation has argued

982
00:42:16,883 --> 00:42:20,260
that the women's and men's
teams are separate organizations

983
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:22,080
that perform services for US Soccer.

984
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,130
They have separate collective
bargaining agreements

985
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:25,700
and they have separate budgets

986
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,403
that take into account different revenue

987
00:42:27,403 --> 00:42:28,816
that the team's generate.

988
00:42:28,816 --> 00:42:30,330
- Yeah well, you also have to be able

989
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:32,880
to see the women's games
in more places, Andy.

990
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,880
I mean, there have been networks

991
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,520
that have pulled their games, et cetera.

992
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,440
So, come on.

993
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,737
All right, before you go, let's talk about

994
00:42:37,737 --> 00:42:41,220
the 15 year old tennis phenom
Coco Gauff, back in action.

995
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:43,160
Right now, playing in
Wimbledon this morning.

996
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,440
How is she doing and
just big picture, I mean,

997
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,959
for so many of us, that
aren't big tennis fans,

998
00:42:47,959 --> 00:42:50,499
she came out of the blue, superstar.

999
00:42:50,499 --> 00:42:52,020
- She certainly did and she is definitely

1000
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:53,700
a superstar in the making, Poppy.

1001
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,360
But right now, this
morning, not looking good

1002
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,050
for her Wimbledon future.

1003
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:58,207
She lost the first set
to world number one,

1004
00:42:58,207 --> 00:43:01,370
Simona Halep, 6-3, down
5-2 in the second set.

1005
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:02,987
But she was actually
in a similar situation

1006
00:43:02,987 --> 00:43:04,901
when she made that big comeback on Friday.

1007
00:43:04,901 --> 00:43:07,362
But Coco has just really
become a crowd favorite

1008
00:43:07,362 --> 00:43:09,420
at Wimbledon, after becoming the youngest

1009
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,300
to make it to the round of 16 in 28 years.

1010
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:15,185
She doesn't turn 16 till March.

1011
00:43:15,185 --> 00:43:17,710
Just an incredible, incredible run.

1012
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:20,330
I mean, Poppy, when you were 15,

1013
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:22,020
could imagine doing something like this?

1014
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:22,853
I know I sure couldn't.

1015
00:43:22,853 --> 00:43:24,707
- I don't know what I was doing at 15,

1016
00:43:24,707 --> 00:43:27,910
nothing close to that, she is remarkable.

1017
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:28,743
Rooting for her.

1018
00:43:28,743 --> 00:43:30,295
Andy Scholes, thank you.
- All right.

1019
00:43:30,295 --> 00:43:32,164

will give a speech,

1020

1021

- [Announcer] Corey is living
with metastatic breast cancer.

1056
00:44:55,763 --> 00:44:57,640
Which is breast cancer that has spread

1057
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,013
to other parts of her body.

1058
00:45:00,019 --> 00:45:03,440
She's also taking IBRANCE
with an aromatase inhibitor

1059
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,311
which is for post-menopausal
women or for men

1060
00:45:05,311 --> 00:45:09,040
with HR+ or HER2- metastatic breast cancer

1061
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,708
as the first hormonal-based therapy.

1062
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:14,100
IBRANCE plus letrozole was
significantly more effective

1063
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:17,000
at delaying disease
progression, versus letrozole.

1064
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,780
Patients taking IBRANCE can develop

1065
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:20,080
low white blood cell counts,

1066
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,680
which may cause serious infections

1067
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:22,870
that can lead to death.

1068
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:24,740
Before taking IBRANCE, tell your doctor

1069
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:27,550
if you have fever, chills,
or other signs of infection.

1070
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:29,460
Liver or kidney problems, are pregnant,

1072
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,900
Common side effects
include, low red blood cell

1073
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:36,440
and low platelet counts,
infections, tiredness

1074

nausea, sore mouth, abnormalities
in liver blood tests,

diarrhea, hair thinning or loss, vomiting,

1076

president Trump will give a speech.

1146
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:41,157
As the White House puts it, quote,

1147

"To recognize his administration's

Good morning to you both.

All right, so we're going to hear from

1161
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,960
the administration on this today.

1162
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,500
And we'll get to, sort
of, why they're doing

1163
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:15,460
this now, in a moment.

1164
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:17,300
But let me just outline for everyone

1165
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:19,852
what this administration's own EPA said

1166
00:49:19,852 --> 00:49:22,160
in a report that came out in April.

1167
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,340
Here are the things that
are happening because

1168
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:26,270
of the climate crisis and emergency.

1169
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:28,340
Hurricane storm intensity, frequency

1170
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,200
and duration will increase.

1171
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,360
More intense droughts,
warmer temperatures,

1172
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:35,351
causing larger wildfires
and longer fire seasons.

1173
00:49:35,351 --> 00:49:38,291
And, they warned, this is
the president's own EPA,

1174
00:49:38,291 --> 00:49:40,041
to anticipate a combination of impacts,

1175
00:49:40,041 --> 00:49:42,658
floods and fires which may be intensified

1176
00:49:42,658 --> 00:49:45,067
because of the changing climate.

1177
00:49:45,067 --> 00:49:48,400
From what you've seen, the
evidence, not the rhetoric,

1178
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,143
is the Trump administration taking

1179
00:49:50,143 --> 00:49:52,050
this seriously enough, at all?

1180
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:53,180
- No, not at all.

1181
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:54,930
And they're rolling back regulations

1182
00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:56,240
in a whole lot of other areas that

1183
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,875
are making people lives less healthy.

1184
00:49:58,875 --> 00:50:01,870
They're a threat to us in
so many different ways.

1185
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:03,400
The climate crisis is just one of them

1186
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:06,270
and that's of course the
huge, 800 pound gorilla.

1187
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:07,510
Pretending it doesn't
exist doesn't stop it,

1188
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:09,597
that doesn't make it go away.

1189
00:50:09,597 --> 00:50:12,150
- Even, no matter what
you say in a speech.

1190
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:13,660
- Absolutely.
- Here, in a few hours

1191
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:15,820
some of what's been rolled back, Bill,

1192
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:17,520
include, obviously, pulling out of

1193
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,590
the Paris climate agreement,
that's a huge deal.

1194
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:21,320
Lowering the car emission standards

1195
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:24,031
that had been increased, right,
to stop so much pollution.

1196
00:50:24,031 --> 00:50:26,100
Weakening the Clean Power Plan

1197
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:27,700
from the Obama administration.

1198
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:29,953
Eliminating the EPA panel on air pollution

1199
00:50:29,953 --> 00:50:32,390
and opening up Anwar, which you've done

1200
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:34,145
a lot of reporting on, in the Arctic.

1201
00:50:34,145 --> 00:50:36,775
- Yeah, you know the
president is old enough

1202
00:50:36,775 --> 00:50:38,757
to remember when you could
taste the air in Los Angeles.

1203
00:50:38,757 --> 00:50:41,580
And when the Cuyahoga
River in Ohio was on fire

1204
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,070
it was so polluted.

1205
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:45,220
And today, you can swim the
Cuyahoga, it's beautiful.

1206
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:47,650
And you can go to LA and see
the San Gabriel Mountains.

1207
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:49,090
But that that didn't happen on accident.

1208
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:49,940
- Right.
- By accident.

1209
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:51,655
It didn't happen on its own.

1210
00:50:51,655 --> 00:50:53,770
It happened when Nixon signed
the Clear Air and Water Act.

1211
00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:56,040
And then 40 years of deliberate lawmaking

1212
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,910
to grind this thing out, to get us where

1213
00:50:57,910 --> 00:51:00,860
you can stand and say, hey,
isn't the air really clear.

1214
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:02,140
New Zealand blows us away.

1215
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:04,340
Sweden has more beautiful cities.

1216
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:06,210
But what's lost in this clean air,

1217
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:09,693
clean water today
messaging, is that he should

1218
00:51:09,693 --> 00:51:12,042
be saying, step to the microphone and say,

1219
00:51:12,042 --> 00:51:15,225
when Barron is my age, America is gonna be

1220
00:51:15,225 --> 00:51:17,550
a completely, life as we know it

1221
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:18,550
will be completely different.

1222
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:20,001
- [Poppy] Because it
is about our children.

1223
00:51:20,001 --> 00:51:20,834
- It is.

1224
00:51:20,834 --> 00:51:23,026
- It's about the future
and he has a young child

1225
00:51:23,026 --> 00:51:24,310
as you bring up.

1226
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:26,750
So listen to, obviously, the president

1227
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:29,449
has touted this and
talked about America's air

1228
00:51:29,449 --> 00:51:32,953
and water as being at a
record clean, his words.

1229
00:51:32,953 --> 00:51:35,040
And then the Vice President, Mike Pence,

1230
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,698
on with Jake Tapper just a few weeks ago

1231
00:51:36,698 --> 00:51:38,440
made this argument, listen.

1232
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:43,217
- America has the cleanest
air and water in the world.

1233
00:51:43,217 --> 00:51:44,670
We'll continue to
- That's not true

1234
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:47,174
- use market forces.
- We don't have

1235
00:51:47,174 --> 00:51:48,410
the cleanest air and water in the world.

1236
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:49,665
- I, I.
- We don't. (chuckling)

1237
00:51:49,665 --> 00:51:53,000
Well, you get back to me with
some statistics that show it.

1238
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,038
- We're making progress on
reducing carbon emissions.

1239
00:51:55,038 --> 00:51:58,585
- I mean, Jake laughed
because it is laughable.

1240
00:51:58,585 --> 00:52:00,950
Because it's just not true.

1241
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:03,480
What are your concerns ahead of the speech

1242
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:05,189
when the administration is putting out,

1243
00:52:05,189 --> 00:52:09,073
just blatant untruths
about the environment.

1244
00:52:09,073 --> 00:52:11,880
- My concern is that people seem to take

1245
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,800
what he says and say,
okay, he may be lying.

1246
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,410
He may not be telling the whole truth

1247
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:16,780
but we don't really care.

1248
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:17,830
We've got to care.

1249
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:19,413
This is the moment when we really need

1250
00:52:19,413 --> 00:52:21,507
to care about this and
it is about our children

1251
00:52:21,507 --> 00:52:22,585
and our grandchildren.

1252
00:52:22,585 --> 00:52:26,386
It's about the future and about
making our lives healthier.

1253
00:52:26,386 --> 00:52:30,320
Making our our economy
greater, which we can do

1254
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,500
and we've done it over
time, as you pointed out,

1255
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:35,300
when we started the EPA
with the Clean Air Act,

1256
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:37,000
the Clean Water, Safe Drinking Water.

1257
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,382
We saw the population grow exponentially.

1258
00:52:39,382 --> 00:52:41,970
We saw the real GDP more than double.

1259
00:52:41,970 --> 00:52:46,970
We saw our energy use
climb and yet we were able

1260
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:49,870
to grow our economy at
extraordinary rates.

1261
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:51,780
So it's not an either/or thing

1262
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:54,713
and we have got to get
over this idea that it is

1263
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:56,640
and somehow doing away with regulation

1264
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,700
is gonna make everything happy.

1265
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:58,590
- I think that's a good point and Bill,

1266
00:52:58,590 --> 00:52:59,990
you've done so much reporting on this.

1267
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:01,855
I mean, it doesn't have to be the case

1268
00:53:01,855 --> 00:53:04,927
that protecting the
environment hurts business.

1269
00:53:04,927 --> 00:53:06,967
It means you transform business.

1270
00:53:06,967 --> 00:53:08,239
- Absolutely.

1271
00:53:08,239 --> 00:53:10,900
As the governor points out, we didn't go

1272
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:12,990
into a 40-year recession
when we started worrying

1273
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:15,620
about breathable air,
those sort of things.

1274
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:19,119
But the other thing that, you
know, the big picture story

1275
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:22,240
that we're just not wired as
human beings to worry about.

1276
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,720
We don't think in long
earth-long time frames.

1277
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,992
We think of if, that noise
behind that (audio dropping)

1278
00:53:26,992 --> 00:53:28,380
is going to eat me, right.

1279
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:29,560
So, you don't think that.

1280
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:31,220
But if you take a step back and realize

1281
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:35,076
that every 2.7 seconds, a
piece of the Arctic ice,

1282
00:53:35,076 --> 00:53:38,460
about the size of a football
field, turns to water.

1283
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:40,071
It's been that way for 40 years.

1284
00:53:40,071 --> 00:53:43,430
So, again, Barron Trump will not get

1285
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:48,410
a 30-year mortgage in Miami,
because it will change

1286
00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:52,060
the actual, physical
topography of our land.

1287
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:53,397
- The administration we hear, Bill, a lot,

1288
00:53:53,397 --> 00:53:56,407
talk about natural gas and
the push for natural gas

1289
00:53:56,407 --> 00:53:59,330
and replacing coal,
parts of coal with that

1290
00:53:59,330 --> 00:54:02,210
and how that, you know,
essentially, solves things.

1291
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:03,751
It helps, right, but it
doesn't at all address

1292
00:54:03,751 --> 00:54:05,850
the big issue, does it?

1293
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:08,430
- Well, everything's cleaner
than coal. (chuckling)

1294
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:10,420
We could burn whales
again and it's be cleaner,

1295
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:11,890
it'd be an improvement over coal.

1296
00:54:11,890 --> 00:54:14,750
But it's still exacerbating the problem.

1297
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:18,650
And the governor can back
me up on, just the numbers.

1298
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:21,040
As solar and wind has actually increased

1299
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,946
and gotten cheaper, it
hasn't replaced fossil fuels.

1300
00:54:23,946 --> 00:54:26,697
We just have a more voracious appetite,

1301
00:54:26,697 --> 00:54:27,881
so we're burning everything.

1302
00:54:27,881 --> 00:54:30,450
Solar, wind and.
- Nuclear.

1303
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:32,353
- Nuclear should be part
of this conversation.

1304
00:54:32,353 --> 00:54:34,630
- I think the transition, is nuclear,

1305
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:36,250
is what we've gotta look at.

1306
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:38,730
Because we've got these nuclear reactors

1307
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:43,470
that produce no regulated
pollutants or greenhouse gases

1308
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:44,670
while they're producing power.

1309
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:46,770
And we seem to be closing them down

1310
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:48,500
which is what, I think, is the problem.

1311
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,520
We're not gonna build any
more new ones, big ones.

1312
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,670
But small, modular reactors, the rest of

1313
00:54:52,670 --> 00:54:53,570
the world's going this way.

1314
00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:55,890
We could create an
enormous number of jobs.

1315
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:57,300
They'd be really good for the economy.

1316
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:00,320
That's the new wave,
along with the renewables.

1317
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,170
And until the renewables, as Bill said,

1318
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:06,520
get to be base power,
not just peak shaving,

1319
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:10,046
so they're on 24/7, then great,
then we can go with that.

1320
00:55:10,046 --> 00:55:10,879
- Governor Whitman, thank you.

1321
00:55:10,879 --> 00:55:12,630

1330
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:32,853
to former number one
ranked player Simona Halep.

1331
00:55:32,853 --> 00:55:35,650

1332
00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:39,606
to make it to the round of 16 in 28 years.

1333

Congrats to her for making it so far.

1340
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:57,778

a sex trafficking ring,

1341
00:55:57,778 --> 00:56:00,286
sexually abusing dozens of underage girls.
