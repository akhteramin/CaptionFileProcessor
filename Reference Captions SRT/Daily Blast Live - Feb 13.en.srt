we have a very special guest co-host.

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,920
You all know him as Dr. Drew Pinsky,

26
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,810
but you're so much more to me.

27
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,750
I know you've heard this
a gazillion times by now

28
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,880
but you're not only a
friend, you're my mentor,

29
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,260
and I really do owe sitting
in this chair to you.

30
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,093
So, thank you.

31
00:01:02,093 --> 00:01:04,430
- There's a reason we worked with you.

32
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,750
You're good.
- Aww, Drew!

33
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,530
- So that's that.
- That means so much to me.

34
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,647
- [Al] Emergency fallout.

35
00:01:08,647 --> 00:01:10,890
(everyone laughs)

36
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:11,723
- Wow, Al.

37
00:01:11,723 --> 00:01:13,470
Geez!
- I love some Sammy.

38
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,303
- Okay, it's harsh.

39
00:01:14,303 --> 00:01:15,820
- Well, thank you for
being here, Dr. Drew.

40
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,570
We begin with an update to
a story we've been tracking.

41
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,840
Empire star Jussie Smollett
is hitting back at reports

42
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,480
that he has changed his story,

43
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,610
or has not been fully
cooperative with police

44
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,940
who are investigating his alleged attack.

45
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,287
Jussie's reps released a
statement that says in part,

46
00:01:30,287 --> 00:01:32,537
"Chicago PD has repeatedly informed us

47
00:01:32,537 --> 00:01:33,807
"that they find Jussie's account

48
00:01:33,807 --> 00:01:36,537
"of what happened that night
consistent and credible.

49
00:01:36,537 --> 00:01:38,367
"Superintendent Johnson has been clear

50
00:01:38,367 --> 00:01:40,790
"from day one that Jussie is a victim."

51
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,820
This comes a day after a spokesperson

52
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,780
for the Chicago Police Department said

53
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,887
that the phone records
that Jussie turned over,

54
00:01:46,887 --> 00:01:49,397
"Do not meet the burden for
a criminal investigation

55
00:01:49,397 --> 00:01:52,010
"as they were limited
and heavily redacted."

56
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:55,270
Now, Jussie's reps contend
that information was redacted

57
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,850
to protect the privacy
of personal contacts

58
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,410
and other high-profile people

59
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,300
who had nothing to do with the attack,

60
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,360
and tomorrow, Jussie is sitting down

61
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,330
with GMA's Robin Roberts
in what looks to be

62
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,080
a highly emotional interview.

63
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,203
Check out this teaser.

64
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,060
- At any point during the attack,

65
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,370
did you fear for your life?

66
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,203
- [Jeff] I'm good.

67
00:02:14,203 --> 00:02:15,650
- So, very emotional interview.

68
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,130
Dr. Drew, I know on your radio show,

69
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,920
you've been following
this case in and out.

70
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,040
What would you say to
the narrative out there

71
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,670
that's pushing that he
may be making this up?

72
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,600
- Yeah, I just think
everyone needs to calm down

73
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,250
and not grab onto any narrative.

74
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,980
It's not our job to create a narrative,

75
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,660
it's the Chicago PD's
to figure out the facts

76
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,950
and put that narrative together

77
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,430
and then tell us what the deal is.

78
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,660
Something happened to him.

79
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,560
If he has overstated it for some reason,

80
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,847
I'm also still worried about him

81
00:02:37,847 --> 00:02:39,980
and what happened that made
him distort this thing.

82
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,620
So, all of us sit back and
just let this thing play out.

83
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,830
It's not our business!

84
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,390
This mob action that we always
get into drives me insane.

85
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,810
- And Tory, you've had a
pretty strong take on this.

86
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,190
- Yeah, I mean, but
you have to understand,

87
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,420
innocent until proven guilty

88
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,300
is because we believe in America,

89
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,920
that we believe our victims at first.

90
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,520
And if it's not true, Dr. Drew's right,

91
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,050
there might be something else wrong.

92
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:01,050
But at this point, imagine
had he let us see his phone.

93
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,970
We're already this way and
we haven't seen anything.

94
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,090
I mean, Tom Brady didn't give up his phone

95
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:07,600
when it was Deflategate and
yet, we're jumping on this guy.

96
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,500
I agree with Dr. Drew.

97
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,600
Let's just put a pause on
everything for a second.

98
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,750
- Yeah, fair enough, I agree.

99
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,690
- I think anything that
we get from this story

100
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,890
will help push your narrative.

101
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,610
There's money to be made from Division.

102
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,021
- Oh, boy.
- So, if--

103
00:03:21,021 --> 00:03:21,854
- [Drew] You're breaking my heart.

104
00:03:21,854 --> 00:03:23,410
- Yes, unfortunately it's
the world we live in.

105
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:24,578
(Drew scoffs)

106
00:03:24,578 --> 00:03:26,100
If this is proven to be a hoax,

107
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,070
now all the conspiracy theorists now go,

108
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,204
and you know what else was a hoax?

109
00:03:29,204 --> 00:03:30,037
- Right.
- Sandy Hook.

110
00:03:30,037 --> 00:03:30,870
- Parkland.
- The Moon!

111
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,950
- Sandy Hooks, the Pizzagate,
and so if it's not,

112
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,510
then there's other places will be like,

113
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,003
see, we're under attack.

114
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,590
So, it's like, everybody
has, unfortunately,

115
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,080
a financial interest in
how this story turns out.

116
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,370
I guarantee you a lot of
people commenting on this

117
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,360
are not fans of his,

118
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,180
and don't care about
his physical wellbeing.

119
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,710
They just see him, or the
kid at the National Museum

120
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:54,190
with the Native American,
as just a way to further--

121
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,733
- Their agenda.
- Further their agenda.

122
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:58,170
- I just encourage people, if
there are holes in your story,

123
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,140
you think there's holes in
his story, which I don't,

124
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,870
watch the interview and
make up your own opinion.

125
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,708
Don't listen to what
people are writing online.

126
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:03,541
- So wait for tomorrow.

127
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,700
We will definitely be covering
the interview tomorrow.

128
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,533
- Absolutely.
- I agree.

129
00:04:06,533 --> 00:04:09,040
- But I don't wanna emphasize Al's point.

130
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,000
The media out there creates narrative.

131
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,700
We're having a conversation about it

132
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:18,030
but you with those headlines
that take a specific position,

133
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,280
one way or the other,

134
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,240
that is for the good of the network

135
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,970
that is giving you the
narrative and nothing else.

136
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:26,780
- They wanna capture your
eyes so they can make money.

137
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,613
- Right.
- As you said.

138
00:04:27,613 --> 00:04:28,446
- They figure out what you wanna hear

139
00:04:28,446 --> 00:04:29,279
and they keep feeding it to ya.

140
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:31,340
- Be an independent thinker, please,

141
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,230
and chime in, DBL Nation, we
wanna hear from you as well.

142
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,940
Well, we finally have some good news

143
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,670
coming out of Washington, D.C. right now.

144
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,580
Let's get to Kelly
Schuberth with the latest.

145
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,120
- Sam, we're just two days away

146
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,990
from another partial government shutdown,

147
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,070
but it looks like the president

148
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,160
may now stop that from happening.

149
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,880
We told you about a tentative deal

150
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,800
that congressional negotiators
came up with Monday night.

151
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,490
Trump said he wasn't happy with the deal,

152
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,600
but Today's sources say that
he is expected to sign it.

153
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,100
In the meantime, Senator Ted Cruz

154
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,280
is backing a different plan

155
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,110
to get the President the
money he wants for his wall.

156
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,410
Cruz sent this Tweet saying

157
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,320
we should use the money U.S. prosecutors

158
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,300
are seeking from now-convicted El Chapo.

159
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,740
They're seeking 14 billion in
drug profits and other assets,

160
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,990
and Cruz says that money

161
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,810
should go towards securing the border.

162
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:14,950
Sam, I'll keep you updated.

163
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,590
- Thank you so much, Kelly.

164
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,450
Well, we have a new top dog.

165
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,500
Meet King, the Fox Terrier.

166
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,333
Look at his beard!

167
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,330
(laughing) Took home the
Best in Show Award last night

168
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:26,040
at the Westminster Dog
Show in New York City.

169
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,810
Competition was rough, but once again,

170
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:29,970
the Fox Terrier won the top prize.

171
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:33,070
This marks the 15th time that
breed has come out on top,

172
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,530
much more than any other.

173
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:37,170
Bono the Havanese took second.
- They were robbed!

174
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,380
- [Sam] But many were upset
that the fan-favorite,

175
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,440
a Longhaired Dachshund named Burns,

176
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,970
Tory's favorite, did not win.

177
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,730
And in a socking turn of events,

178
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:45,940
the Schipperke named Colton,

179
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,430
who won the Non-Sporting
Group, was disqualified--

180
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,263
- Scandal!
- Scandal!

181
00:05:49,263 --> 00:05:51,220
- [Sam] The moment before the judging

182
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,620
due to a conflict of interest.

183
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,480
Other top dogs include Baby
Lars, who won the Herding Group.

184
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,313
He's a Bouvier des Flandres.

185
00:05:58,313 --> 00:05:59,887
(everyone laughs)

186
00:05:59,887 --> 00:06:01,002
- [Drew] Bouvier des Flandres.

187
00:06:01,002 --> 00:06:01,835
(hosts laughing)

188
00:06:01,835 --> 00:06:02,889
And great pronunciation on that.

189
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:03,985
I thought I was back in France.

190
00:06:03,985 --> 00:06:05,357
(hosts laughing)

191
00:06:05,357 --> 00:06:08,200
- And this Sussex Spaniel named Bean,

192
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,420
who won the Sporting Group,

193
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,980
and finally meet Wilma, the Boxer,

194
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,210
who took home the Gold
for the Working Group.

195
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,620
But it wasn't just us humans

196
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,310
who enjoyed watching the dog competition.

197
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,490
Check out all these dogs who
really got into the action.

198
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:23,480
Tory, I know, now first of
all, scandal really, Tory?

199
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,313
- Big scandal.
- What?

200
00:06:24,313 --> 00:06:25,600
- Big Scandal.
- No!

201
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,660
- The Schipperke was
in it, and guess what?

202
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,927
They shook hands with the judge and said,

203
00:06:28,927 --> 00:06:29,840
"I need you to leave."

204
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,070
That is huge in the dog world, am I right?

205
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,221
- I don't know.
- He does know.

206
00:06:33,221 --> 00:06:35,507
- I had to do the shaking
hands, like they're gonna kiss,

207
00:06:35,507 --> 00:06:36,340
and then you're gonna go--

208
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,630
- And then it was.
- Wait, do we know why?

209
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:40,983
- Yes, because the judge
was a co-owner of said dog.

210
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:41,816
- Ugh.

211
00:06:41,816 --> 00:06:42,683
Oh, no!
- It was an owner

212
00:06:42,683 --> 00:06:44,218
eligibility issue.

213
00:06:44,218 --> 00:06:45,390
- Shouldn't that be illegal?

214
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,240
- Well, it was.

215
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,030
He did a nice lap and then he walked.

216
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,200
- Oh.
- I just have to say this,

217
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,516
the Wire, I know you're a dog-person.

218
00:06:50,516 --> 00:06:51,349
- I am a dog-person.

219
00:06:51,349 --> 00:06:53,910
- The Wire Fox Terrier
has won 15 times, okay?

220
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:54,917
The bearded guy that looks like Sherlock?

221
00:06:54,917 --> 00:06:56,210
- He's Beerlock.
- He looks like a guy.

222
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,260
- He looks like a guy, right?
- I wouldn't want him

223
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,710
in my bedroom when I'm dressing.

224
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,720
- And I'm not saying this
'cause I own a Dachshund.

225
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,910
At some point, that
Dachshund was on that night,

226
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,490
and he stood like this,
and he and the crowd--

227
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:06,323
- Okay.
- Okay, sorry.

228
00:07:06,323 --> 00:07:08,450
- Can I get a one-shot on
Tory while she does that?

229
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:09,283
Do it, Tory.

230
00:07:09,283 --> 00:07:10,116
- [Tory] Okay, so.

231
00:07:10,116 --> 00:07:12,126
- This is the Dachshund, one-shot on Tory.

232
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,983
- [Al] Please don't put
me in it, there you go.

233
00:07:16,646 --> 00:07:18,080
(hosts laughing)

234
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,315
- Thank you. (clapping)
- And he shoulda won!

235
00:07:19,315 --> 00:07:20,148
- Well done, well done.
- And win that,

236
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,532
but it was Madison Square Garden!

237
00:07:21,532 --> 00:07:22,920
Thank you everyone, thank you.

238
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,905
- Wow, look at Jeff.
- It's crazy!

239
00:07:23,905 --> 00:07:24,738
- Hey, could we move past this?

240
00:07:24,738 --> 00:07:25,571
- Yeah, so angry!
- We covered this story

241
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:26,404
more than the Super Bowl.

242
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,346
- He's so angry.
- This is insane.

243
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:29,830
- Can somebody explain to me
why I watch it religiously

244
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,970
every year after the Macy's
Parade on Thanksgiving?

245
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,104
Is this a recorded version?

246
00:07:33,104 --> 00:07:34,352
- It's such a tradition!
- No, this is Westminster.

247
00:07:34,352 --> 00:07:35,185
The other one is another one.

248
00:07:35,185 --> 00:07:36,570
- That's the National Dog Show.

249
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:37,403
- Yes, exactly, correct.
- This is the Westminster.

250
00:07:37,403 --> 00:07:39,090
But this is the more
prestigious one, right?

251
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:39,923
- A bit, yes.

252
00:07:39,923 --> 00:07:40,756
- I think it's

253
00:07:40,756 --> 00:07:41,589
a little antiquated.
- Oh!

254
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:42,422
- It is, completely.
- They should have

255
00:07:42,422 --> 00:07:43,255
rescue dogs only.

256
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:44,088
- And they do.

257
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,210
They have a whole separate
one for rescue but I--

258
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,865
- Yes, they call it The
One People Don't Watch.

259
00:07:46,865 --> 00:07:47,698
(Tory laughing)

260
00:07:47,698 --> 00:07:49,562
- Yeah, I like the
beautiful dogs, come on now.

261
00:07:49,562 --> 00:07:50,433
- Okay, wow!

262
00:07:50,433 --> 00:07:52,367
- 'Cause you wouldn't have
to buy one, it's just.

263
00:07:52,367 --> 00:07:53,200
- Oh, how fun was it.

367
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,940
- Well, we, this is important

368
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,410
because a lot of our viewers at home,

369
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,370
you guys love Dr. Drew,

but today we're focusing on relationships.

372
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,760
- Okay.
- We've asked our viewers

373
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,450
to send in their love-related questions

374
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:05,060
for a segment we're calling
Dear DBL, with Dr. Drew.

375
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,220
So let's get started.

376
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,410
Al, let's take the first one.

377
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:08,290
- [Al] All right!

378
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,577
It says, "Wanting More in Saint Louis:

379
00:12:10,577 --> 00:12:13,013
"My bedroom life with
my girlfriend sucks!"

380
00:12:13,013 --> 00:12:13,846
- Uh-oh.
- Okay!

381
00:12:13,846 --> 00:12:15,207
- [Al] "And we're only in the first year

382
00:12:15,207 --> 00:12:16,040
"of our relationship.

383
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,307
"Three times a week if I'm lucky.

384
00:12:18,307 --> 00:12:19,977
"Am I the bad guy for wanting

385
00:12:19,977 --> 00:12:21,350
"to break up with her over this?"

386
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,680
- Okay, well mismatched sexual desire

387
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,110
is a very common thing.

388
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:28,670
Three times a week, above
average by the way, not bad.

389
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,380
- She doing good!
- I'd say Tory and Sam

390
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,911
do a little bit like
oh, what the hell here.

391
00:12:32,911 --> 00:12:33,744
- What?
- What?

392
00:12:33,744 --> 00:12:34,577
- How much this guy want

393
00:12:34,577 --> 00:12:36,100
but that is mismatched sexual desire

394
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,370
- That's above average?
- Yeah.

395
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:38,470
- [Sam] Well, what about
it being the first year?

396
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,303
- Above average.

397
00:12:39,303 --> 00:12:40,485
Average in long-term relationship

398
00:12:40,485 --> 00:12:41,808
is about 1 1/2, two times a week, average.

399
00:12:41,808 --> 00:12:42,940
- But what about a new
relationship like this?

400
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,087
- We just learned something about Al, too.

401
00:12:44,087 --> 00:12:44,920
Just make that known.

402
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,990
(hosts laughing)

403
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,526
- [Al] If not twice a
day, it wasn't a day.

404
00:12:47,526 --> 00:12:48,359
- Oh, Lord, Al!
- Right and some people

405
00:12:48,359 --> 00:12:49,730
are at that rate, that's for sure.

406
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:50,769
- Yeah.

407
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:51,602
- And people have

408
00:12:51,602 --> 00:12:52,700
to reach a compromise.
- What?

409
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,210
- See, we just learned
something about Jeff, too.

410
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,043
(hosts laughing)

411
00:12:55,043 --> 00:12:56,827
- If twice a day is not a day,

412
00:12:56,827 --> 00:12:58,110
how do you get anything done?

413
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,480
- There's this thing called
morning and night, Jeff.

414
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,808
- Yeah, I love sleep.

415
00:13:01,808 --> 00:13:04,757
- A lot is revealed just in
answering these questions,

416
00:13:04,757 --> 00:13:06,150
but it's about compromising

417
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,160
and you have to be able to tell her

418
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,520
that this is not your rate
and you have to step it up.

419
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,790
There may be things contributing to that.

420
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,723
We don't think about this,
and one of the things

421
00:13:12,723 --> 00:13:15,190
that I see most commonly in young couples,

422
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:18,200
when a female sexual desire
is not matching a man,

423
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,850
she may be on a high
progesterone birth control pill

424
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:23,140
and that suppresses their libido

425
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,710
and doctors don't tell 'em about that.

426
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,750
So take a look at your birth control.

427
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,310
The progesterones can really
be working against you.

428
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,143
- Good to know.
- That's amazing.

429
00:13:29,143 --> 00:13:29,990
- Wow.
- This guy!

430
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,237
- I know!
(laughing)

431
00:13:31,237 --> 00:13:32,720
He's like a fountain of knowledge.

Ellie Mae writes,

433
00:13:33,553 --> 00:13:35,977
"I'm in a marriage where my
husband gambles compulsively

434
00:13:35,977 --> 00:13:37,650
"and frequents gentleman's clubs."

435
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,807
- Uh-oh.
- "After 34 years of marriage,

436
00:13:39,807 --> 00:13:41,049
"we are drowning in debt."
- Oh!

437
00:13:41,049 --> 00:13:42,550
- Oh, boy.
- "Should I walk out?"

438
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,480
This is Ellie Mae.

439
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,530
- So, Ellie Mae, this is for real.

440
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:46,520
Ellie Mae?
- Yeah.

441
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,820
- Like from the Beverly Hillbillies?

442
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,653
- Yeah.
- It's amazing.

443
00:13:48,653 --> 00:13:49,725
- Burt, that was for you.

444
00:13:49,725 --> 00:13:50,930
(hosts laughing)

445
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,220
So, yeah, this is really,
this is a tragedy.

446
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,180
And this is a great example of
how real gambling addiction,

447
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,770
when you really see it, it destroys lives.

448
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,670
There may be some sexual
addiction in here, too.

449
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,610
He's going to gentleman clubs.

450
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,320
You have to decide if
you're gonna leave or not.

451
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,280
I'd for sure go to a
program called Al-Anon,

452
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,850
which is support for those

453
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,690
and loved one's with
addictions of various types.

454
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:13,420
There's specific ones for
gambling and sex addicts,

455
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,060
but Al-Anon's easier to find

456
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,520
and then think about what
you wanna do with this.

457
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,510
But absolutely, he gets
treatment or you leave

458
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,977
is a very reasonable position to be in.

459
00:14:21,977 --> 00:14:23,050
- Wow.
- Wow, that's good to hear.

460
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:23,883
- Sad.

461
00:14:23,883 --> 00:14:24,897
- Ruth in Louisvile writes,

462
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:26,587
"I'm dating someone
going through a divorce.

463
00:14:26,587 --> 00:14:28,497
"We both feel strongly about each other,

464
00:14:28,497 --> 00:14:31,267
"but she's not ready for
a relationship right now.

465
00:14:31,267 --> 00:14:33,317
"Yet, we both can't
stop seeing each other,

466
00:14:33,317 --> 00:14:35,807
"and it feels more like a rebound.

467
00:14:35,807 --> 00:14:38,400
"Is our timing setting us up to fail?"

468
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,700
- And, but I gotta answer,

469
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,880
finish up on that last question, too.

470
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,670
He goes to gamblers, like
GA, Gambler's Anonymous.

Or SLA, Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous,

472

Sex Addicts Anonymous, back to this one.

473
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,160
This is Trevor, right?

474
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,054
- Mm-hmm.
- Is that him?

475
00:14:50,054 --> 00:14:50,887
No, it's not.
- Yup.

476

- No, yes, Trevor?

477
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,553
- This is Ruth.
- Oh, Ruth.

478
00:14:52,553 --> 00:14:53,386
- Ruth.
- Ruth.

479
00:14:53,386 --> 00:14:54,553
- Ruth, I'm...

480
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,490
When somebody's going through a divorce,

481
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:01,150
you don't wanna get hooked
into a long-term relationship.

482
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,570
You wanna wait 'til that's
all over with and behind them.

483
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,850
You're more of a life-preserver

484
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:06,890
when somebody is going through

485
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:09,383
that kind of a horrible
crisis in their life.

486
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,370
We need a lot more information

487
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,203
to kinda tease it out for you, but I--

488
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,500
- [Sam] Could it work out?

489
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,810
- It could, but I got
bad feelings about this.

490
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:18,210
- Whoa, okay.
- Yeah.

491
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,319
- Interesting.
- Mm.

492
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:20,570
- That's you, Jeff, it's your turn.

493
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,120
- I just read Ruth.

494
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,166
- I'll read Trevor in Tampa.
- Oh, geez!

495
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:24,999
- Boom!
- Trevor in Tampa said,

496
00:15:24,999 --> 00:15:25,950
"My girlfriend gets mad at me--

497
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:26,783
- [Jeff] That'll teach you

498
00:15:26,783 --> 00:15:27,690
how to handle my business up there.

499
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:28,612
- [Drew] I love it!

500
00:15:28,612 --> 00:15:29,517
(hosts laughing)

501
00:15:29,517 --> 00:15:32,887
"For not posting pictures of
us together on social media.

502
00:15:32,887 --> 00:15:35,007
"I like to post about my
hobbies, not relationships,

503
00:15:35,007 --> 00:15:36,317
"but she thinks I'm hiding her.

504
00:15:36,317 --> 00:15:37,780
"Who is in the wrong here?"

505
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,040
- [Sam] That's a relatable one.

506
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,840
- It is a relatable one, and, ugh.

507
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,740
You, sir.

508
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,210
You, sir, need to step up

509
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:48,060
because she's letting you
know something very simple

510
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,580
that could make her very happy,

511
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,100
and why wouldn't you do that

512
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,050
if you know it's something
that really would help somebody

513
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,640
or make her feel good and she's
somebody you say you love,

514
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,784
why wouldn't you wanna do that?

515
00:15:56,784 --> 00:15:57,617
- Amen.
- Wow!

516
00:15:57,617 --> 00:15:58,680
- Amen!
- Drew, quickly,

517
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,281
what's wrong with our
dysfunctional family?

518
00:16:00,281 --> 00:16:01,310
- Yeah, what's wrong here?
- Yes!

519
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,238
- I'm mostly worried
about you and Sam, Jeff.

520
00:16:03,238 --> 00:16:04,491
(hosts laughing)

521
00:16:04,491 --> 00:16:05,324
That's where I see the trouble.

522
00:16:05,324 --> 00:16:07,130
- I'm off the hook!
- Yeah.

523
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,014
- Tory?

524
00:16:08,014 --> 00:16:08,847
- They're all doin' pretty good.

525
00:16:08,847 --> 00:16:09,680
- Al?

526
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,513
I don't know about that.

527
00:16:10,513 --> 00:16:11,346
- Well, I'm normal.
- All right.

528
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:12,179
- Everybody says I'm the normal one.

529
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,012
- Sure, okay.

530
00:16:13,012 --> 00:16:15,070
- We heard a little
(stammering) you're above normal

531
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:16,344
in certain areas, Al, just saying.

532
00:16:16,344 --> 00:16:17,449
- [Hosts] Oh!

533
00:16:17,449 --> 00:16:18,282
- I get that a lot.
- We found that out

534
00:16:18,282 --> 00:16:19,460
10 minutes ago, five minutes ago.

535
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,670
- Coming up on DBL, a lot of people

536
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:24,170
are saying Esquire
magazine missed the mark

537
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:25,350
with this cover story.

538
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,720
We'll tell you what all
the commotion is about.

539
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,300
And talk about a throw back.

540
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,280
Actor Anson Williams from Happy Days

541
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,070
settles the score once and for all.

542
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,970
So, who's cooler, Potsie or the Fonz?

543
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,170
Come on now, the Fonz.

544
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:38,027
He tells our own Tory Schulmen next.

545
00:16:38,027 --> 00:16:39,343
- [Tory] It was Potsie.

546
00:16:39,343 --> 00:16:40,734
(lively music)

547
00:16:40,734 --> 00:16:41,868
(transitions to lullaby music)

548
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:44,570
- Shh, that's it.

549
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,510
Sleep tight, little one.

550
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,910
- Thanks, mom.

551
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,768
You take such good care of him.

552
00:16:49,768 --> 00:16:51,553
- That's what grandmas do.

553
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:54,200
- I don't know what we'd do without you.

554
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,290
- Well, I made sure you'll
have help even after I'm gone.

555
00:16:58,290 --> 00:16:59,290
- After you're gone?

556
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,570
Mom, are you okay?

557
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,500
- Everything is fine.

558
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,960
Just so you know, I got
a life insurance policy,

559
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,983
so when the time comes, I won't
leave you a financial mess.

560
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,040
Let's face it.

561
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,410
There will be a funeral,
and maybe medical bills.

562
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,540
It's not an inheritance or anything,

563
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,190
but it will help cover my expensenses.

564
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,330
- I don't wanna think about that.

565
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:22,950
- Well, you don't have to.

566
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,890
I already took care of it.

567
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:28,410
And with this policy, I can
earn discounts, get rewards,

568
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,930
and even get tips on how to live healthy.

569
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,800
That could help me be around even longer

570
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,140
for that little guy.

571
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,780

(percussive music)

603
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,670
- Welcome back to DBL.

604
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:54,180
All month long, I am talking
with TV legends from the past

605
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,170
to find out where they are now.

606
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,020
So, I headed to The Hollywood Museum

607
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,610
in the heart of Los Angeles, California

608
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:03,120
and sat down with Anson Williams,

609
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,723
better known as Potsie from

610
00:19:04,723 --> 00:19:06,940
♪ Monday, Tuesday, Happy Days ♪

611
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:07,900
Check it out.

612
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,960
(lively orchestral music)

♪ Monday, Tuesday, I'm in heaven ♪

614
00:19:13,449 --> 00:19:15,480
(laughing) It was very, very good opening.

615
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,720
I am here with someone

616
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,030
that I've always had a secret crush on

617
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,340
and now it's not so secret.

618
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,960
It's Anson Williams of Happy Days.

619
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,133
Hello, how are you?

620
00:19:22,133 --> 00:19:22,966
- I am good.

621
00:19:22,966 --> 00:19:23,980
Those are original lyrics.

622
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,920
- [Tory] I was gonna say.

623
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,670
- I haven't heard those lyrics before.

624
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,560
- Never heard that before, it's amazing.

625
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,570
You play one of the most
iconic characters ever on TV.

626
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,500
Do you have a favorite memory?

627
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,890
- Actually the best
memories aren't on the show,

628
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:37,140
they're off the show.

629
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,942
We had a softball team and
we went all over the world.

630
00:19:40,942 --> 00:19:42,030
- [Tory] Get outta here!

631
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,000
What was your team name?

632
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,138
- Let me guess!

633
00:19:44,138 --> 00:19:45,230
Happy Days!
- Happy Days!

634
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,610
That was very clever.

635
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:47,489
- I like how original that was.

636
00:19:47,489 --> 00:19:48,322
- Yeah, it was, do ya like that?

637
00:19:48,322 --> 00:19:49,250
- [Tory] So, you were best friends

638
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,850
with Richie Cunningham, Ron Howard.

639
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,770
We also have Fonzie, Henry Winkler.

640
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:55,900
We wanna know straight up,
which one made you laugh harder?

641
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,733
- Oh, Henry, yeah.

642
00:19:56,733 --> 00:19:57,566
He's a genius.

643
00:19:57,566 --> 00:19:58,530
There's no words for it.

644
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,900
Just universal hysterics.

645
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,470
Look at the character he created, Fonzie.

646
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,370
That was not written.

647
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,969
- [Tory] Do you still keep
in touch with these guys?

648
00:20:05,969 --> 00:20:06,802
- We do!
- Yes?

649
00:20:06,802 --> 00:20:08,470
- We do.
- That makes me happy.

650
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,000
- [Anson] We've been friends forever.

651
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,420
- Now, a lot of people actually told me

652
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,760
they had crushes on you,

653
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,170
but Fonzie was sort of the cool guy.

654
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,700
Did Potsie ever wanna be Fonzie?

655
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,211
- Who would not wanna be Fonzie?

656
00:20:17,211 --> 00:20:18,132
(Tory laughing)

657
00:20:18,132 --> 00:20:18,965
Are you kidding?

658
00:20:18,965 --> 00:20:19,940
Let's be truthful!

659
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:20,773
- Let's be honest, here.
- All right?

660
00:20:20,773 --> 00:20:21,606
Come on!

661
00:20:21,606 --> 00:20:22,870
Oh, no, I like Potsie better.

662
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:23,703
What?

663
00:20:23,703 --> 00:20:24,536
Shoot me now.

664
00:20:24,536 --> 00:20:26,650
- I heard that maybe one
of The Beatles came by?

665
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:27,483
- A couple of The Beatles.

666
00:20:27,483 --> 00:20:28,740
- Tell me about that,

667
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,212
'cause I think I'm all
(screams) about this.

668
00:20:31,212 --> 00:20:32,663
- I was (screams) about that.

669
00:20:32,663 --> 00:20:33,496
(Tory laughing)

670
00:20:33,496 --> 00:20:36,000
You're on a set, Happy Days.

671
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,660
There's a guy standing
by the coffee machine

672
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:43,330
that looks just like Jonh Lennon
in sunglasses and some kid,

673
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,017
and Donny goes, "Oh, yeah.

674
00:20:45,017 --> 00:20:47,860
"John Lennon came here to
hang out with us (laughs)."

675
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,510
It was John Lennon who came
here to hang out with us.

676
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,343
You bet.

677
00:20:51,343 --> 00:20:54,140
The nicest, kindest, shyest guy.

678
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,050
He's doing doodles for, like literally,

679
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:56,980
original John Lennon
doodles for the crew--

680
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,060
- You know how much those are worth?

681
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:58,893
- Yeah, for the crew.

682
00:20:58,893 --> 00:21:00,670
Not us, oh no, we're professionals.

683
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:02,570
We don't ask for anything.

684
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:04,267
The crew bought houses
with the freakin' picture.

685
00:21:04,267 --> 00:21:05,100
(Tory laughing)

686
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,720
I haven't told anyone.

687
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,880
On this show will be the first.

688
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,160
- Exclusive!
- And this just happened.

689
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,310
It's exclusive, four,
five, six months ago?

690
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,910
There's this very nice looking man.

691
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,277
So I'm sitting there and
all of a sudden I hear,

692
00:21:14,277 --> 00:21:15,880
"Excuse me, I don't mean to interrupt."

693
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,817
It was Julian Lennon.

694
00:21:19,263 --> 00:21:20,932
(Tory laughs)

695
00:21:20,932 --> 00:21:21,765
- [Tory] I'm sorry, I don't mean to--

696
00:21:21,765 --> 00:21:24,860
- 40 years later.
- Oh my god!

697
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,950
- [Anson] Can we take a selfie?

698
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,470
40 years later, it all came around.

699
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,742
- [Tory] That's a great story.

700
00:21:29,742 --> 00:21:31,310
- True story.
- That's a crazy story.

701
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:33,040
I think all the millennials
know Buy One Get One

702
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,750
which is my favorite thing
in the whole wide world.

703
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,660
You found a way to curate
it all in one area.

704
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,550
- You bet.
- Tell me about that.

705
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,350
- It's called BOGOlist.com.

706
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:41,320
The best BOGO's are there, have fun.

707
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,750
Not only is it the lottery win every time,

708
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,380
it's the best deals on the internet.

709
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,950
- Thank you Anson Wilson
for taking the time.

710
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,910
It's been amazing, thank you so, so much.

711
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:49,743
- Thank you.

712
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:51,710

715
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,130
to check out an extended interview

716
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:59,990
where Anson and I discuss
his product, Alert Drops.

717
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:02,840
It's a simple solution
to combat drowsy driving

718
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,010
and it can save lives.

719
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:05,105
We'll be right back.

720
00:22:05,105 --> 00:22:07,120
(lighthearted music)

721
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,610
- [Announcer] Promotional consideration

722
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:10,460
is brought to you by.

723
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,610
- [Announcer] If a dirty
CPAP is making you sick,

724
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:13,720
you're not alone.

725
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,600
- I was getting sinus infections

726
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,950
because I wasn't cleaning my CPAP properly

727
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:20,400
and that continued until I got my SoClean.

728
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:22,190
- [Announcer] SoClean is the world's

729
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:25,170
first automated CPAP
cleaner and sanitizer.

730
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:29,210
It kills 99.9% of all
CPAP germs and bacteria

731
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:31,860
that can build up in your
mask, hose, and reservoir.

732
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,410
- I don't have to push
a button or anything.

733
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:35,130
I just put the mask in the chamber,

734
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,310
close the lid, and it runs automatically.

735
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:40,330
SoClean has been a life-saver.

736
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:41,163
- [Announcer] SoClean works

737
00:22:41,163 --> 00:22:43,310

738

this limited time offer.

742
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:56,560
- I would recommend the
SoClean machine to anyone else.

743
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,240
It is that good of a machine.

744
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,320
It has made that big a
difference in my life.

745

748
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,320
- [Man] What is Verify?

749
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,900
- Hi, I keep seeing stories about felons

750
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,230
that are running for Congress.

751
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,340
Could you verify?

752
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,173
- [Narrator] Verify.

753
00:23:19,173 --> 00:23:21,940
A new way to separate fact from fiction.

754
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:25,210
You ask the questions,
Verify will do the digging

755
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:26,970
with full transparency.

756
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,720
- We went to a political
science professor.

757
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,190
A reverse-image search led us to this.

758
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,700
He's a felon!

759
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,893
Nicole, yeah, we can Verify that for you.

760
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:36,990
- [Announcer] Verify.

761
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:37,833
Look into it.

762
00:23:41,465 --> 00:23:42,298
(bouncy music)

763
00:23:42,298 --> 00:23:45,110
- Well, cooking in my kitchen
before was pretty archaic,

764
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,730
so we went to Joe at Cabinet Discounters.

765
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:49,930
He was able to design it and lay it out.

766
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:52,620
But he laid out a very
functional kitchen for us.

767
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:55,050
The term discounted to me is just a word.

768
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:57,440
And, they really designed
a nice kitchen for us

769
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,760
and it absolutely met our expectations.

770
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,130
We've actually gone back
twice and had work done.

771
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:05,150
We certainly would recommend
it to any of our friends.

- With Cox, you can watch all your movies

776
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,057
and shows whatever the weather.

777
00:24:15,057 --> 00:24:17,157
(thunder rumbling)
(people chattering)

778
00:24:17,157 --> 00:24:19,898
With DirecTV, heavy rain or
snow can affect your signal.

779
00:24:19,898 --> 00:24:21,950
(thunder rumbling)
(family sighs)

780
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:24,260
It's clear that Cox is the better choice,

781
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:27,000
just like it's clear
that the make-up artist

782
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,135
is still learning the ropes.

783
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:30,575
(man coughs)

784
00:24:30,575 --> 00:24:33,106

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,910

Tory, I gotta ask you.

831
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:06,440
What's a perfect Valentines
Day for Tory Shulton?

832
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,170
- I just don't get it together,

833
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,010
so at the very end of the day,

834
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:10,840
I'm writing a coupon for a hug,

835
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,673
you know what I mean?

836

- All right, I'm just
gonna get this out there.

841
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,340
I think Valentine's Day is embarrassing.

842
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:23,700
I got a pizza, but I cut
it in the shape of a heart.

843
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,001
Oh, no.

844

- (laughing) What?

845
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:26,667
- That's because that's something

846
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:29,080
that no human being would
ever do that really loves you.

847
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:29,913
- [Tory] What's wrong with that?

848
00:26:29,913 --> 00:26:30,947
- 'Cause I don't like rose petals--

849
00:26:30,947 --> 00:26:32,970
- It's cute.
- Leading to your

850
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:35,490
stupid bedroom with the ceiling fan going.

851
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:36,910
It's like, this the same bedroom.

852
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:39,270
