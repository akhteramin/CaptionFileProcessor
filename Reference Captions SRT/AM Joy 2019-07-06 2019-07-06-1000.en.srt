1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,730
- This week on America's birthday,

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:04,690
known as Independence
Day or simply July 4th,

3
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:07,500
Donald Trump threw himself a party.

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,580
Ever since he saw that the
French president has a parade,

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,930
it's called Bastille Day

6
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,490
and the dictator of
North Korea has a parade,

7
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,810
it's called Authoritarianism,

8
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,170
and that they get to have tanks

9
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,867
and people marching in front
of them and saluting them

10
00:00:21,867 --> 00:00:24,693
and all that stuff, he's
wanted to have one too.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,390
He tried to co-opt other
holidays to get his parade

12
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,840
like Veterans Day or Memorial Day

13
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,790
but the adults in the military
kept pushing him back.

14
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,080
Well no more.

15
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,660
Donald Trump finally got his
special Donald Trump parade.

16
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,420
Rolling tanks down the
streets of your capital,

17
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,120
flying Air Force planes over his head

18
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,980
while he gave an odd
speech about the airports,

19
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,860
the Continental Congress took control of

20
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,393
during the Revolutionary War.

21
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,580
- In June of 1775, the
Continental Congress

22
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:01,540
created a unified army out
of the revolutionary forces

23
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,570
encamped around Boston and New York

24
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:08,390
and named after the
great George Washington,

25
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:09,930
Commander-in-Chief.

26
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,280
The Continental Army
suffered a bitter winter

27
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,260
at Valley Forge, found glory

28
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,460
across the waters of the Delaware

29
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,980
and seized victory from
Cornwallis of Yorktown.

30
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,030
Our army manned the airports,

31
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,270
it rend the ramparts, it
took over the airports,

32
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:30,840
it did everything it had to do

33
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,880
and it fought McHenry under
the rocket's red glare,

34
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,013
it had nothing but victory.

35
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,530
- Okay!

36
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,210
I'm sure that you know this already

37
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,860
because you paid attention in school,

38
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,790
but just so that it's
said, the Continental Army

39
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,310
was not named after George Washington.

40
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,980
There was no air travel
during the Revolutionary War.

41
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,620
Airplanes weren't even
invented until 1903.

42
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,940
And the Battle at Fort McHenry

43
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,943
happened during The War of 1812!

44
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,703
Details!

45
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,020
In the end, for millions
of your tax dollars,

46
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,570
this what you, well actually
what Donald Trump got.

47
00:02:11,834 --> 00:02:16,380
- On this day, 243 years ago,

48
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,300
our founding fathers pledged their lives,

49
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,880
their fortunes and their sacred honor

50
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:26,327
to declare Independence and
defend our God-given rights.

51
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,610
- Throwing not an American president

52
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:40,230
but what looks like an
authoritarian leader.

53
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:43,600
Festooned by his military and
making a show of force to,

54
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,270
well it's not really clear who.

55
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:48,290
Because Donald Trump actually
really likes dictators.

56
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,780
Joining me now is Maria Teresa Kumar,

57
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,820
president and CEO of Voto Latino.

58
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,800
Jelani Cobb, professor at
Columbia Journalism School,

59
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,320
Craig Unger, Vanity Fair contributor

60
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,720
and author of "House of
Trump, House of Putin"

61
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,800
and Representative Ted Lieu,
Democrat from California

62
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,270
and a member of the Foreign Affairs

63
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,910
and Judiciary committees.

64
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,730
I wanna go to you first Congressman.

65
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,283
What did you make of it?

66
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,900
Watching an American president

67
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,390
do this thing that Tom Nichols

68
00:03:17,884 --> 00:03:19,630
who's an expert on the
history of the Soviet Union

69
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,490
and of that region, described as looking

70
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:26,723
like an old Soviet kind of parade.

71
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,310
- Thank you Joy for your question.

72
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,410
Let me just first say
that natural disasters

73
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,307
like earthquakes can strike at any time

74
00:03:33,307 --> 00:03:35,330
and I urge everyone to be prepared

75
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,300
with supplies and a safety plan.

76
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,730
Now to answer your question,
one of the big problems

77
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,680
with Trump's July 4th event,

78
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,470
is that it was a campaign event

79
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,000
paid for by the American taxpayer.

80
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,550
Not only did he divert millions
of dollars to this event,

81
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:52,130
he also had the Republican
National Committee

82
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:56,040
give out passes, VIP
passes to major donors.

83
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,410
That was outrageous.

84
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,160
That was really a violation of our ethics

85
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,593
and he made a mockery
of our Independence Day.

86
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,420
- And thank you for mentioning

87
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,160
what's going on in your state.

88
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,840
We just saw two natural disasters

89
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,130
in the state of California.

90
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,850
So this is a time when
the federal government

91
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:14,130
actually has priorities
that are important,

92
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,510
that we should be spending money on.

93
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:18,100
Things like making sure,
that states are ready

94
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,030
for natural disasters like
you just saw in your state.

95
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,770
So when you see the President
of the United States

96
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,030
diverting money so that he can have planes

97
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,500
fly over him rather
than spending the money

98
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,100
on important things like that
or maybe uncaging children,

99
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,460
which he's also doing in
the state of California

100
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,110
and Arizona and other places.

101
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,330
As a member of Congress,
is there something

102
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:39,570
that you guys plan to do about that?

103
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,370
Because this does seem like
a tremendous waste of money.

104
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,470
- Members of Congress can't
even use official resources

105
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,800
to participate in a parade.

106
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,790
In this case, Trump diverted $2.5 million

107
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,890
of National Park fees
to pay for his party.

108
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,090
And I've asked the Federal
Election Commission

109
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:59,550
to look into this because how can you have

110
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,640
all this taxpayer money do this event

111
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,000
and then have the Republican
National Committee

112
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,610
be involved in such a major way

113
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:08,913
handing out VIP passes
to their major donors.

114
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,930
- Yeah, and besides that, I
wanna go to you Craig Unger.

115
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,880
You've written a lot about Donald Trump

116
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,470
his Mafia sort of
relationships that he's had

117
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:23,300
throughout his career, particularly
when it comes to Russia.

118
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,650
This is what Michael McFaul,

119
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:28,360
who is the former US
Ambassador to Russia tweeted

120
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,230
after Donald Trump's weird parade.

121
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:34,270
He said, "I knew this was coming."

122
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,760
Tweet from Julia Davis News,

123
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,710
Russia's state TV is obsessively
bashing Trump's low energy,

124
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:42,230
weak parade with rusty tanks.

125
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,680
The host's LOL at Trump's claim

126
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,610
about Revolutionary War airports,

127
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,120
and other historical flubs.

128
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,900
There's your city upon a hill.

129
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,400
There's your world leader,

130
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,170
and Martians have been defeated.

131
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,440
The fact is that Donald
Trump not only wasted

132
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,150
America's money, to make
himself a campaign commercial,

133
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,730
but he also has subjected
the United States to mockery

134
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:06,860
because real dictatorships
know what a dictator parade

135
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,580
is supposed to look like Craig.

136
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,150
- Right, well at least sometimes

137
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,200
they get their facts straight.

138
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,610
It's interesting that
if the Russian State TV

139
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,540
is going after Trump, that doesn't happen

140
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,760
without Vladimir Putin's say-so.

141
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,320
It's also interesting
that clip you showed,

142
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,270
the number of historical errors

143
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,100
and it is just extraordinary

144
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,450
and the White House has an
office of speech writing

145
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,990
with lots of researchers and interns

146
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,613
and they fact-check things.

147
00:06:34,613 --> 00:06:37,460
And there are only three possibilities

148
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,920
for that level of transcendental
stupidity to take place.

149
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,180
One is, that that office is completely

150
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,530
filled with people with
room temperature IQ.

151
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:51,030
The other is that all the
procedures have fallen apart

152
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,540
and they don't exist anymore.

153
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,650
And the third possibility is it sprung

154
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,487
from the brain of Donald Trump

155
00:06:56,487 --> 00:06:58,713
and that is deeply, deeply disturbing.

156
00:07:01,493 --> 00:07:02,800
- There's a lot about it
that's disturbing Jelani.

157
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,210
I wanna go to you on this,
I'm glad that you're here

158
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:07,530
just to have an historical
context to all of this.

159
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:10,890
Donald Trump really admires
dictatorships around the world.

160
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,080
He seems to really admire Kim Jong Un.

161
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,410
All of the media has been saying

162
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:16,050
that this is supposed to
be sort of his version

163
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,630
of the Bastille Day ceremony.

164
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:20,180
But I pointed out earlier
this week on MSNBC

165
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,540
the whole Bastille Day thing

166
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,450
is about sending a message to dictators.

167
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,750
That's what the whole
Bastille Day parade is about.

168
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,890
This is clearly not that,

169
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,230
because Donald Trump likes dictators.

170
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,200
That's not what you're trying
to send a message doing.

171
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,150
So in your mind, what is this,

172
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,780
what was the message of what you saw,

173
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,613
I don't know if you watched it

174
00:07:35,613 --> 00:07:37,700
but what was the message
that you think came out

175
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,170
of what Donald Trump did this week?

176
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,720
- Oh it was pure and
grandiosity and self-inflation.

177
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,820
And so one of the things I
think that's significant here

178
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,630
is that the United
States at least in theory

179
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,200
is supposed to operate on the doctrine

180
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,740
that we are a nation of laws,
that no one is above the law

181
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,160
and that the constitution is
the fundamental authority.

182
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,650
That is a different position,

183
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,400
fundamentally different position

184
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,900
than a state in which the personality

185
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,950
or the authoritarian leader

186
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:09,260
is the head of all interests and ideas

187
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,290
within the state.

188
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,410
And so what Donald Trump did,

189
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,140
was essentially hijack this idea

190
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,330
and turn it into something

191
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,223
that was supposed to glorify himself.

192
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,900
This kinda interesting paradox here

193
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,760
which is that several years ago,

194
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,090
I did a Fulbright Fellowship

195
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:27,740
and I spent an entire semester in Moscow

196
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,500
teaching at Moscow State University

197
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,350
and at the end of the semester,

198
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:34,450
there was the May 9th Celebration.

199
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,560
Anybody who has been to Russia

200
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,820
or knows about their
history post World War II,

201
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:43,490
May 9th is a gigantic celebration

202
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:47,420
that happens each year,
somewhere between the 4th of July

203
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:51,080
and New Year's and it is a recognition

204
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,170
of the Soviet defeat of the Nazi threat,

205
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,600
an existential threat that confronted them

206
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,850
during World War II.

207
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,090
So it's a huge and I'm able
to be there for the parade

208
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:07,090
and there's just this kind
of complete procession

209
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,060
of military vehicles.

210
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,220
There are missiles, there are tanks,

211
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,680
there are armored
vehicles, there are Jeeps

212
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,830
and it looks like an army
amassing for an invasion.

213
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,150
And so someone turns to me and says,

214
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,080
do you do the same thing
in the United States

215
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,203
on the 4th of July.

216
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,120
I said no, this would never
happen in the United States

217
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,950
because they in the United States believe,

218
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:31,270
we believe that there should
be a really clear distinction

219
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:34,410
between civilian authority
and military might

220
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:37,600
and that our authority is
supposed to, at least in theory

221
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,660
stem from our laws and our moral beliefs.

222
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:44,870
And what Donald Trump did,
was essentially invert that

223
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:49,240
to create it as a kind of satirical almost

224
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,740
emulation of something that
he sees in Vladimir Putin.

225
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,770
We should recognize this as
the anti-democratic movement

226
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:57,820
that it actually was.

227
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,170
- Yeah, Maria Teresa, there's an example.

228
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,613
I mean Eugene Robinson
made a similar point

229
00:10:02,613 --> 00:10:03,870
when he talked about the fact

230
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,280
that Trump tried to make himself look big

231
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,550
by doing this piece.

232
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,580
A little bit of what
Eugene, what he wrote,

233
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,740
it was clear from the beginning

234
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,413
that Independence Day
meant nothing more to Trump

235
00:10:10,413 --> 00:10:11,980
than an opportunity to choreograph

236
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,030
a made for television re-election event

237
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,310
and give himself an obscenely
expensive ego message.

238
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,840
It invoked mockery.

239
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,190
There's a cartoon, we're gonna show here

240
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:23,080
that's drawn on what
airplanes would look like

241
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,540
during the Revolutionary War.

242
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,260
It's a picture of Ben Franklin

243
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,200
attached to two kites, there it is

244
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,860
and this is by somebody I know.

245
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,380
This is by the great Natalie
Johnson who drew that.

246
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:35,270
Here's the reality, Donald Trump it seems

247
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:38,500
wants to be seen as this big man.

248
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,940
He wants to be seen as this grand leader

249
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,800
of this great military

250
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,070
but what he actually can accomplish

251
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:49,530
through his own, the quality of the staff

252
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,460
that he has around him,
is he can't do that.

253
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,880
He can't do what Jelani
just talked about, right?

254
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,920
The reality was right,
even in the case of Russia

255
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,850
which now is an adversary
of the United States,

256
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:02,110
during World War II they
were fighting the Nazis.

257
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,597
So if they're doing a big celebration

258
00:11:03,597 --> 00:11:06,230
and talking about
defeating the Nazi Empire,

259
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:09,340
they're sort of sending a
message again to dictators.

260
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,570
There are only two kinds of these parades.

261
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,460
There's that, and there's
the one like in North Korea.

262
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,770
Trump is tying to do it
because I think he thinks

263
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:18,073
he's emulating it, he
doesn't even know how.

264
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:22,342
- Or really why!
- This is to Maria.

265
00:11:22,342 --> 00:11:27,271
- We're the largest military
operators in the world.

266
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:30,630
We don't have to show that
type of display of force

267
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,270
because the world already knows it.

268
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,020
And what I found so disappointing

269
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,300
when it came to the July 4th is July 4th

270
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,610
is to commemorate our roots as Americans.

271
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:40,470
Where we come from,

272
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,320
the fact that we may have
fled different countries

273
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,130
or we came here because we recognize that.

274
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,600
Our Americanism, our DNA is this idea

275
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,580
that we're a nation of immigrants

276
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,580
and we have strength and
we don't have to show

277
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,670
military might because the
world already knows it.

278
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,150
And what Donald Trump did
was such a sad display

279
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:56,150
because he didn't have the courage

280
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:59,320
to actually join the military
when his card was up.

281
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,630
He instead deferred on bone spurs.

282
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:04,910
And so he basically, not
only deteriorates the flag

283
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:07,237
but also the meaning of what
it means to be an American

284
00:12:07,237 --> 00:12:08,810
and what it means to be July 4th,

285
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,580
what it means to come
together as a nation.

286
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,340
The reason that presidents
don't show up on July 4th

287
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,520
and don't make it about them,

288
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,700
is because it's one country
under one flag and one unity.

289
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,030
It's not supposed to be partisan

290
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:22,240
and what instead he did is
he created a campaign rally,

291
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,020
trying to differentiate and divide us

292
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:27,270
and what I espouse and what
I think was really beautiful

293
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:29,237
is that you still saw
families on that lawn saying,

294
00:12:29,237 --> 00:12:31,490
"I'm apolitical, I'm here to
share it with my families."

295
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,000
And that's what we should remind people

296
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,050
of what July 4th is.

297
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,400
We don't have to show military might,

298
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,390
we don't have to scare the world,

299
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,010
we know what we are, we know who we are

300
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,910
and we know that we do it with justice.

301
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,160
The fact that he can do this

302
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,840
in the backdrop of caging children,

303
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,850
that is not who we are

304
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,260
and the more that we
can actually make sure

305
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,050
that we are standing
strong to those values,

306
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:50,000
despite about what I call this
aberration in our history,

307
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,900
we have to make sure that
we are very clear minded

308
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,733
of what it means to be American

309
00:12:52,733 --> 00:12:54,260
and what it means to be democratic

310
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,663
and what it means to be fair and just.

311
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,630
- Yeah, very quickly just
let everybody go through

312
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:00,650
one last chance.

313
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:02,500
Jelani, do you think that what you saw,

314
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,090
what Donald Trump made us look stronger

315
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,270
or weaker as a country?

316
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,420
- Oh absolutely weaker.

317
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,530
The worst part of it is that,

318
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:12,690
had this actually not
been an inept display

319
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:15,350
of pseudo-authoritarianism,

320
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,880
we still would have looked weaker.

321
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,490
If he had done this correctly,
in air quotes, correctly,

322
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:21,810
we would have looked weaker.

323
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,230
But now we look doubly weak,

324
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:25,170
because it is a poor imitation

325
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:26,900
of something that was
never meant to be imitated

326
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,850
in the first place.

327
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:31,490
- Yeah, very quickly
and to go to you Craig.

328
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:32,860
When the Russians look at us,

329
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,760
they're already laughing at us.

330
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,190
Donald Trump thinks
they're his best friends.

331
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,630
Are they his friends
or is he now a subject

332
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:40,610
of even mockery to them?

333
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,930
- Well, I think he is subject to mockery

334
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,110
and I think Jelani is absolutely right.

335
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:47,450
The images that come away from it today,

336
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:51,120
are that we have concentration
camps on the border,

337
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,650
we have tanks by the Lincoln Memorial.

338
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:56,100
The mall is, there was
an interesting piece

339
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,810
in the Washington Post.

340
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:00,360
The architecture is about reconciliation.

341
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,810
It's by the Lincoln
Memorial, our original sin

342
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,970
was slavery, we had a Civil War

343
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,440
and this is where we were
supposed to have reconciliation

344
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,920
and instead, today we have images of tanks

345
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,453
and the whole crisis at the border.

346
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,560
- I'm gonna give you the
last word Congressman

347
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,840
because you are a member
of the Air Force I believe.

348
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,090
You've served in the military.

349
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:23,510
As a person who actually did
serve, unlike Donald Trump,

350
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:26,130
when you saw tanks rolling
down the nation's capital,

351
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,220
your thoughts were what?

352
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,620
- Having served in active
duty in the military,

353
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,050
we've been trained to not participate

354
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:35,090
in partisan campaign events.

355
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,670
There was a Department
of Defense directive

356
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,500
that prohibits military members

357
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,740
from showing up in uniform
at a campaign rally.

358
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:44,430
This was a massive
taxpayer-funded campaign rally

359
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:45,630
with the Republican National Committee

360
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,400
handing out VIP passes.

361
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,810
It really eroded what should be

362
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:53,163
a non-partisan military and
that was sad and disappointing.

363
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,730
- Thank you all for being here

364
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,110
and sending out really good thoughts

365
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,610
to your state Congressman Lieu.

366
00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:59,610
Thank you very much all of you.

367
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:00,840
Maria Teresa is gonna be back.

368
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,240
Jelani Cobb, Craig Unger
and Congressman Ted Lieu,

369
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,810
thank you guys very much and coming up,

370
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:08,200
as Donald Trump celebrated
himself on the 4th of July,

371
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,450
people looking for a better future

372
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,910
were locked in cages
on our southern border.

373
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,160
Great, more on that next.

374
00:15:14,312 --> 00:15:16,980
(dramatic music)

375
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,360
- [Announcer] Everyone loves the benefits

376
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,050
of compression socks
but they're just so hard

377
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,410
to get on, until now!

378
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:26,460
Introducing the all new
Copper Fit Energy Socks.

379
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:30,290
Redesigned for the first
ever easy on, easy off fit,

380
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:33,280
to help reduce swelling,
relieve tired aching muscles

381
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,210
and provide energizing support.

382
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,980
A new blend of stretch fabric

383
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,730
for the most comfortable, easy
on easy off compression fit.

384
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,440
- Being a SWAT Commander,
we're trained to win.

385
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,620
The Copper Fit Energy Socks,

386
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,430
they didn't feel like
other compression sock.

387
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:47,290
It totally exceeded my expectations.

388
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:49,710
- [Announcer] Our most
powerful copper-infused fabric

389
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:52,880
woven into our easy on,
easy off compression sock

390
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,780
to help reduce swelling discomfort

391
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,840
from prolonged sitting or standing.

392
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,620
- I'm 38 and 1/2 weeks pregnant.

393
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,190
Copper Fit Energy Socks works beautifully.

394
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:03,500
- [Announcer] Extra support
around the arch and ankles.

395
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,210
For increased support and relief

396
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:07,040
of muscle aches and pains.

397
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,940
- I'm so excited about this sock.

398
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,950
I'm so much more energized to go do things

399
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,170
after a day of work.

400
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:15,810
They just slip right
on, yet they still have

401
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:18,060
that same compression that you want.

402
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,630
- [Announcer] A soft cushion foot bed

403
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,290
for all day comfort.

404
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:23,450
- I'm on my feet at least
nine or 10 hours a day.

405
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,640
These were fantastic.

406
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,740
A lot of compression socks
are a little too thin

407
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,680
especially for what I do.

408
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,020
With Copper Fit, I can
wear these every day.

409
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,690
- [Announcer] Feel more
energized, feel more active,

410
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,430
just feel better.

411
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,760
- They just hug your leg.

412
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,240
It relieves all the
pressure that you have.

413
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,060
I have so much energy, I can go.

414
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,110
Hey, you wanna dance.

415
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,530
- [Announcer] The first
ever easy on easy off

416
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:46,770
compression sock, the most
comfortable compression sock

417
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,320
you will ever wear.

423
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,820
- I've never felt anything like it before.

424
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:07,690
- No more pain, no more swelling,
no more achy tired feet.

425
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:10,460
- I can never go back to
regular compression socks again.

426
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,130
- [Announcer] Don't settle for ordinary.

427
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,058
Ask for the original by name.

428
00:17:14,058 --> 00:17:16,010
(crowd cheering)

429
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:18,350
- Coach, it's kinda hard to see the ball.

430
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,250
- I've been there.

431
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:24,100
I had a TV service with
hardly any sports in 4K.

432
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,350
Couldn't see any of the quality details.

433
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,090
I switched to DIRECTV.

434
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,597
Now I get the most live sports in 4K.

435
00:17:30,597 --> 00:17:31,930
- So, how does that help me?

436
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:34,440
- It really doesn't, I don't
know why I told you that.

437
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,643
Go get 'em sport.

438
00:17:35,643 --> 00:17:36,890
- [Announcer] Live
sports that aren't in 4K,

439
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:37,990
are just kinda TV.

440
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,780
Don't just kinda TV, DIRECTV.

441
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,810
Don't have 4K, call 1-855-WATCH-4K

and ask for it today.

443
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,820
- [Announcer] This
summer, all eyes will be

on the US Women's National Team

446
00:17:51,283 --> 00:17:54,320

the TouchNote app now.

454
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,370
- How do you know how to run,

455
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,680
when you've never done anything

456
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,680
remotely like this before?

457
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,530
- We're prepared to do it in a novel way,

458
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,760
in an original way and we wanna make sure

459
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,140
that we're writing our own playbook.

460
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,420
- Do you think that we should
keep troops in Afghanistan?

461
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,830
- I do not and I believe
that we need to do it though

462
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,143
in a responsible way.

463
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,920
- Where do you see your party right now?

464
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,900
- It's going to be how do we
think government should work

465
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,763
and who do we think
government should work for?

466
00:18:47,462 --> 00:18:49,630
(dramatic music)

467
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:53,083
- What we saw today was unconscionable.

468
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:59,180
No child should ever be
separated from their parent.

469
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,950
- The mothers, the abuelas, the tias,

470
00:19:04,787 --> 00:19:07,110
the madres that I sat with,

471
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:10,670
who wept openly in our arms.

472
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:14,270
- Never forget the
image of being in a cell

473
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:18,790
and seeing 15 women, tears
coming down their faces

474
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:22,850
as they talked about being
separated from their children

475
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,930
about having no running water.

476
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,250
- In fact one of the women said,

477
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,170
that she was told by
an agent to drink water

478
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,213
out of the toilet.

479
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,510
- This week Democratic lawmakers

480
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:37,810
once again saw for themselves
the shameful conditions

481
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,500
that migrant children and adults

482
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,860
have been forced to live in.

483
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,910
Specifically at a detention
facility in Clint, Texas.

484
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,850
Conditions that the Department
of Homeland Security's

485
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:49,410
Inspector General confirmed
in a report this week.

486
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,510
Now let me read to you
some of the findings.

487
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,880
Quote, children at three

488
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,880
of the five border patrol facilities

489
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,050
that we visited had no access to showers.

490
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:01,330
At these facilities
children had limited access

491
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:02,740
to a change of clothes.

492
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,920
Border patrol had few spare clothes

493
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,580
and no laundry facilities.

494
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,800
While all facilities had infant formula,

495
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,870
diapers, baby wipes and juice
and snacks for children,

496
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,240
we observed that two facilities

497
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,670
had not provided children
access to hot meals.

498
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,020
But Customs and Border Patrol,

499
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:21,230
were so desperate to dispel
these firsthand accounts

500
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:23,040
from lawmakers and from activists

501
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,730
that one of its chiefs filmed a video

502
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:28,630
showing a supply room filled
with an abundance of clothing

503
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:32,030
and hygienic supplies, as
well as clean drinking areas

504
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,460
at a detention facility, wait for it,

505
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,683
three hundred miles away in Arizona.

506
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:38,783
There it is.

507
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,330
Back with me, Maria Teresa Kumar

508
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:42,190
and also joining me, Andrea Pitzer

509
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,697
who's a journalist and
author of "One Long Night:

510
00:20:44,697 --> 00:20:47,300
"A Global History of Concentration Camps"

511
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,850
and Elora Mukherjee who's a director

512
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:53,170
of the Immigrants Rights
Clinic at Columbia Law School

513
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,170
and Elora is also a lawyer who has visited

514
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,240
detention centers at the southern border

515
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,360
for the last 12 years.

516
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,570
And Elora, thank you for being here.

517
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:01,120
I'm gonna start with you.

518
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,350
I wanna play for you a
little bit of a video

519
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,480
that was obtained of a 12-year old girl,

520
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,660
a 12 year-old migrant.

521
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,910
This was her account for
being detained for two weeks.

522
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:14,210
It's in Spanish, for those
of you who are watching,

523
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,590
so you'll have to just read the subtitles

524
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,243
if you don't speak
Spanish but hear you go.

525
00:21:18,989 --> 00:21:22,489
(speaks foreign language)

526
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,190
Elora, we've heard stories of little kids

527
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:52,210
being forced to take care
of other little kids.

528
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,830
Children sleeping on the ground

529
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,520
in nothing but a diaper,

530
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,590
children saying that they
only got one meal a day.

531
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:00,180
We heard this little
girl's horrifying story

532
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,280
of being detained, is this legal?

533
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,930
- No, this is absolutely not legal.

534
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:08,240
Federal law provides for protections

535
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,500
for children in Federal
Immigration custody.

536
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,490
The 1997 Flores Settlement Agreement

537
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:16,930
requires that the Federal government

538
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:20,060
provide safe and sanitary conditions

539
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,640
for children in its custody.

540
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,220
A law from 2008 which was passed

541
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,310
with unanimous bipartisan support

542
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,940
and passed by President George W. Bush

543
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,800
says that children must not be detained

544
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,150
by Customs and Border Patrol

545
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:37,930
for any longer than 72 hours.

546
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:40,530
The conditions that we're learning about,

547
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:44,790
what we hear, what I smelled
when I was at these facilities,

548
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:47,503
it is unlawful and illegal.

549
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,250
- And then Elora, how can they,

550
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,770
this is what I have not understood

551
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:52,940
and I'm gonna go to you first

552
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,310
and then I'm gonna go
to Maria Teresa Kumar

553
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,410
because we've talked for a long time

554
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:56,710
about why they might be doing it.

555
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:00,680
They're holding kids for
50 days, 40 days, 30 days.

556
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,290
They're holding them as if almost like,

557
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,470
it's like they're
ransom, they can't leave.

558
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:08,530
How can they get away
with it, if it is illegal?

559
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:11,500
- It is illegal and
what's important to know

560
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,550
is that most of these children

561
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:16,450
have family members in the United States

562
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:20,410
who are desperate to
have their children back.

563
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:23,710
More than 80% of children released

564
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:27,840
from the federal government
are housed and cared for

565
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,623
and loved for by their own family members.

566
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,160
We need immediate congressional oversight

567
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,960
and pressure on this administration

568
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,920
to release children from detention

569
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,700
as quickly as possible.

570
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,410
And while children are detained,

571
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:45,423
they must be treated humanely.

572
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:47,870
- Yeah, and you know Maria Teresa Kumar,

573
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:49,470
I have to go to you on this because,

574
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,370
we have been down there,
you have been there

575
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:54,070
much more than I have,
obviously Elora has been there.

576
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:57,950
I'm not a lawyer, it strikes
me as completely illegal

577
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:00,230
to hold children in this manner

578
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,830
when as Elora just said
they have family to go to.

579
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,490
Donald Trump calls that catch-and-release

580
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,100
and says he's not doing it.

581
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,650
Why in your view are they
holding these children?

582
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,000
Is it the money that they're making?

583
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I mean it's 750 bucks a day
to hold kids in these camps.

584
00:24:15,009 --> 00:24:16,790
Is it straight money?

585
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,573
Why are they not letting them go?

586
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,220
- I think there's a couple of things.

587
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,840
I think one is political fodder.

588
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:27,390
It shows that he is the
strong-fisted person

589
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:29,050
that is basically making sure that,

590
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,570
they're trying to use this as a deterrent.

591
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:31,780
He didn't come up with this.

592
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:35,440
This is Steve Miller, his senior advisor

593
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,597
with his fingerprints all over it.

594
00:24:36,597 --> 00:24:39,600
But it allows, it's good for
political fodder for his base,

595
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,940
that he is being tough
and that it's really

596
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,410
the parents' fault that they came here.

597
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:45,400
But two, there's a lot
of money to be made.

598
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,570
The moment that Donald Trump
was elected into office,

599
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,400
all of a sudden the private
detention facilities,

600
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,400
the for-profit detention facilities,

601
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,973
their stock prices went,
literally went on the rise.

602
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,360
The former Chief of Staff John Kelly

603
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,650
who advised President Trump
and before was head of the DHS,

604
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:04,730
he was also one of the architects of this.

605
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:06,530
Guess where John Kelly is now.

606
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:08,540
He is now on the board of advisors

607
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,310
to one of the largest detention
for-profit facilities.

608
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:14,700
He has actually gone down
to Homestead down in Florida

609
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,170
which is one of the largest facilities

610
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:18,910
that houses close to 3200 minors.

611
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,770
And they keep them for a long time.

612
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,740
Unlike President Obama who did have

613
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,910
the moniker of deporter in chief,

614
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:27,380
President Obama processed
individuals and deported them.

615
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,690
This president has little
intention of deporting them.

616
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:30,950
These children who are minors

617
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:33,640
are not supposed to be in
custody for more than 20 days.

618
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,940
In some cases, they languish
in there for months.

619
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,740
In some cases, almost a year.

620
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,750
And it's clear that the
only way that you do it

621
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:42,620
is that you ensure that someone
is making a lot of profit

622
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,140
and you do it away from the cameras,

623
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,970
you do it away from the American public

624
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:47,580
and you do it almost in secret.

625
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,300
The fact that this is basically,

626
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,790
you have some ICE agents
actually coming out

627
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,670
and anonymously showing pictures

628
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,270
of what is happening in the facilities.

629
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:57,810
They're trying to also ring the red light

630
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:59,820
of this is not normal, this is illegal

631
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,240
and we need the American
people to stand up for it.

632
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,900
The fact that the United Nations

633
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,380
have declared that the United States

634
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,940
is in violation of children's human rights

635
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,780
should be screaming at
the top of the lungs

636
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,940
of every single American
saying this is not who we are.

637
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,260
And we have to make this
a political campaign issue

638
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,483
because this is what
we actually stand for.

639
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,820
- Andrea, we've had a
whole bunch of people

640
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:22,690
getting upset and debating
over what you call these camps.

641
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:24,190
I don't know what else you would call it

642
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,450
other than concentration camps.

643
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,380
If these children are
being deliberately held

644
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,210
longer than they're
legally allowed to be held,

645
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:30,043
they won't let them go.

646
00:26:30,043 --> 00:26:31,970
They seem to be displaying their misery

647
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:34,010
really to sort of entertain,
I don't know what it is

648
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:36,000
that they're trying to
show the American people

649
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,220
but they seem to want us to know

650
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,720
that they're doing this to these kids.

651
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,543
We even had a young man,
who was allegedly shamed.

652
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:48,740
They hung a sign on him,
saying I like men, in Spanish

653
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,870
and put a sign on him
to try to humiliate him.

654
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:54,250
This reminds me almost of
the way that we behaved

655
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,460
at Abu Ghraib, where we
were just trying to display

656
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,210
the mockery of these people.

657
00:26:58,210 --> 00:26:59,530
I don't understand what's going on here.

658
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:01,940
I don't understand how it
can possibly be going on

659
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,260
and that no one's stopping it,

660
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:05,040
your thoughts Andrea.

661
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,230
- So, look it's no surprise
that there are echos

662
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:10,540
of prior camp systems from Abu Ghraib

663
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,570
and going back more than 100 years even,

664
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:14,800
in what we're seeing on the border today.

665
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,120
The turn of the 20th century,

666
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,800
Emily Hobhouse went
down to southern Africa

667
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,260
and was shocked that the British

668
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:23,300
weren't providing soap to
children and women in detention

669
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,040
so that they could prevent
contagious diseases.

670
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,780
Tens of thousands of people
would die in those camps

671
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:31,580
while parliament argued
over whether it was fair

672
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:34,210
to call them concentration camps.

673
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:37,810
In Germany, in 1933 a
man named Hans Beimler

674
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:39,430
was arrested and taken to Dachau

675
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:42,710
where the Nazis put a sign
around his neck to humiliate him.

676
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,090
So we've seen this all before.

677
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:46,330
We've seen the humiliating signs, no soap,

678
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,040
arguments over what to call it,

679
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:51,220
overcrowding, deaths
from contagious diseases.

680
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,680
What we have is not a death
camp system like Auschwitz

681
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,760
but it is a concentration camp system.

682
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,810
It's a malevolent system

683
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:00,450
that has deep roots in a polarized society

684
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:03,490
that is willing to do
harm to vulnerable people.

685
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:06,830
And the thing is that, if the
authorities don't intervene,

686
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,200
we know what's going to happen.

687
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,590
We're gonna move to the next stage

688
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,500
of concentration camp abuses,

689
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:15,233
which are gonna show up not as
negligence but as atrocities.

690
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,837
- I'm gonna ask all of
you to please come back--

691
00:28:18,837 --> 00:28:20,850
- Can I just add something--
- Very quickly.

692
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:22,653
- Okay!
- Yeah, very quickly.

693
00:28:24,548 --> 00:28:26,710
- So Joy I think the bigger issue too

694
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:29,123
is that we know that a lot of these folks

695
00:28:29,123 --> 00:28:31,920
that are getting these
government contracts

696
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,850
actually served as security guards

697
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,430
for Afghanistan and for Iraq.

698
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:38,750
They have no business being
surrounded by children.

699
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,400
- Yeah, absolutely. I wanna
have you guys come back.

700
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,490
Because we wanna try to think about

701
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:43,323
what these children can do.

702
00:28:43,323 --> 00:28:44,650
I don't know if there's some lawsuit.

703
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:46,590
We need to figure out what to do next.

704
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,830
Thank you very much Maria Teresa Kumar,

705
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:50,580
I'm sorry I'm out of time.
Andrea Pitzer, Elora Mukherjee,

706
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:53,010
thank you all three very
much and later on this hour

707
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:55,710
we are gonna talk about this
disturbing new information

708
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,950
that we're learning about the culture

709
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:59,650
at the Border Protection Agency.

710
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:00,790
So please stay tuned for that.

711
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:03,690
And coming up next, even
after he was slapped down

712
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:06,470
by the Supreme Court, Donald
Trump is still not giving up

713
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:08,560
on his attempts to rig the census.

714
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,127
It's just getting better
and better and better.

715
00:29:11,127 --> 00:29:11,960
We'll be right back.

716
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,670
(dramatic music)

717
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:16,140
- How many people love
you unconditionally?

718
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,640
While you ponder that,
consider adopting a rescue pet.

719
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,690
There are six and 1/2 million of them,

720
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,700
they all need a forever home.

721
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,347
It would mean the world to them

722
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:29,070
and they will love you
forever, The More You Know.

- [Announcer] Stay tuned to get a free pan

741
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,630
from Granite Stone.

742
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:04,130
Stuck on eggs, burnt on butter,

743
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:06,980
you can scrub and scrape
but you can't escape

744
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:10,300
the nightmare of your sticky pans.

745
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,590
Introducing the Granite Stone pan,

746
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:15,330
the all new durable non-stick pan.

747
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:16,980
No butter or oil needed.

748
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:20,490
Watch, we melted down this
sticky candies in Granite Stone

749
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:22,060
and it just doesn't stick.

750
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,600
We cooked a half a dozen
eggs, bacon, cheese

751
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,400
and tomato breakfast with no butter or oil

752
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,350
and it just doesn't stick.

753
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:31,860
Look, caramels, chocolate and cheese,

754
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:35,360
unreal for any other pan
but not for Granite Stone.

755
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,910
It just doesn't stick.

756
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:39,520
Granite Stone will be the
last pan you'll ever need

757
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,870
because it's pressed from
a solid aluminum disk

758
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,580
for even heat conduction.

759
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,830
Then coated three times with our durable

760
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:47,380
Granite Stone finish.

761
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:50,410
Granite Stone is metal
utensil safe and won't scratch

762
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:52,610
and talk about non-stick, this salmon

763
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:55,660
cooks skin side down with
no added butter or oil,

764
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,890
just doesn't stick.

765
00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:00,030
This steak is perfectly
seared just like the pros.

766
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:03,540
And because Granite Stone is
oven rated to 500 degrees,

pan pizza to perfection

768

- Okay!

817
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:05,650
Officials in Southern California
are assessing the damage

818
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,690
after the second powerful
earthquake in the region

819
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:09,520
in just the last two days.

820
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,340
Friday's quake had a magnitude of 7.1

821
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,810
and was centered in the
desert city of Ridgecrest.

822
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:17,570
It was felt more than 100
miles away in Los Angeles

823
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:19,550
and in Las Vegas.

824
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:21,170
It rattled homes and businesses

825
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:24,270
and sparked fires and power outages.

826
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:26,280
At a baseball game between
the Los Angeles Dodgers

827
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,920
and the San Diego Padres,

828
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,910
Dodgers Stadium seemed to shake and roll

829
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:33,180
for nearly a minute, but
the players played on.

830
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,720
Friday's quake comes one day

831
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,190
after a 6.4 magnitude
earthquake in the same region.

832
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:40,740
And officials say there
will likely be more.

And up next in AM Joy, Trump
and his far-right allies

836
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,970
want to rig the census to
beat back a changing America.

837
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:53,450
But since he's Donald Trump,

838
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:55,450
he may have already tanked his own case.

839
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:02,550

- Hi, I'm Alex Schulze.

865
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:01,080
- And I'm Andrew Cooper.

866
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,020
- In 2015, we took a surf
trip to Bali, Indonesia

867
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,410
and saw firsthand just how bad

868
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:07,960
the world's plastic
pollution crisis really is.

869
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,180
We wanted to make it our mission

870
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,380
to solve this problem, and we have.

871
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,290
- [Andrew] We started cleaning
the ocean by ourselves.

872
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:15,540
Until 2017, when we started

873
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:18,100
our ocean cleanup company 4ocean.

874
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,130
- Now, we've become the world's largest

875
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:22,590
ocean cleanup company,
employing captains and crews,

876
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:25,460
seven days a week to clean
our oceans and coastlines.

877
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,730
We've operated out of
27 different countries,

878
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:30,790
and to date, we've removed over
two million pounds of trash

879
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:31,830
from the ocean.

880

efforts are funded entirely

883
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,980
through the sale of our bracelet.

884
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:41,550
The 4ocean bracelet is
made from our ocean plastic

885
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:44,310
and the recycled glass
bottles that we collect.

886
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:46,300
- Every bracelet purchase
helps fund the removal

887
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,190
of one pound of trash from the ocean

888
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,580

00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,830
- [Announcer] New Aspercreme dry spray.

910
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:02,360
- [Man] The only person
who's ever stopped doomsday

911
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,259
doesn't exist any more.

912
00:37:04,259 --> 00:37:06,200
- I have to at least try.

913
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,900
It's time for this madness to end.

914
00:37:09,626 --> 00:37:11,676
Enough Kryptonian blood has been spilled.

915
00:37:13,865 --> 00:37:14,698
- Is that it?

916
00:37:14,698 --> 00:37:15,531
- Not even close.

917
00:37:18,579 --> 00:37:21,668
- [Man] You thought you were
him, you are no Superman.

918
00:37:21,668 --> 00:37:24,418
(dramatic music)

919
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,000
- The census, is a
constitutionally mandated operation

920
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:41,350
that we are required to
implement every 10 years.

921
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:42,830
It is one of the most vital

922
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:47,110
and sensitive things that
we do in our government.

923
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:52,110
I want to know why this
question was magically added

924
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:55,060
after we have seen that
a political operative

925
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:58,210
knew and detailed an intent to intimidate

926
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:00,300
racial and immigrant communities

927
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,513
for a partisan purpose.

928
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:05,850
- A recent Supreme Court
decision last month

929
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,360
in which Chief Justice John Roberts

930
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,430
sided with the liberals on the court,

931
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:11,380
made it clear, the majority on the court

932
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,410
saw right through the Trump
administration's attempts

933
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:17,080
to rig the constitutionally
required United States census

934
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,530
to try and take money and resources away

935
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,910
from non-white people and immigrants.

936
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:24,340
The Trump administration's
attempts to pretend

937
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,900
that they really wanted to
add a citizenship question

938
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:31,300
to the census to help them
enforce the Voting Rights Act,

939
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,620
were easily seen right through.

940
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:35,320
And while the career lawyers
at the Justice Department

941
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,960
seemed content to listen to the court,

942
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,640
apparently Donald Trump was not.

943
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,690
After going on a Twitter tirade

944
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:44,740
apparently after canoodling
with his far-right allies

945
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:47,670
Donald Trump has ordered
the DOJ to try again.

946
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,460
Now, a federal judge in Maryland

947
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:52,600
has ordered a new version
of the case to be heard.

948
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,730
On Friday Trump invented a new power

949
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:56,510
that he thinks he has as president.

950
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:58,450
Saying that he's considering
an executive order

951
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:01,763
to force the citizenship
question on to the census.

952
00:39:03,226 --> 00:39:04,059
- [Reporter] Are you going to issue

953
00:39:04,059 --> 00:39:05,430
an executive order on the census?

954
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:07,360
- We're thinking about doing
that. It's one of the ways,

955
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,550
we have four or five ways we can do it.

956
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,190
It's one of the ways
that we're thinking about

957
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,220
doing it very seriously.

958
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,990
We're doing well on the census.

959
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:15,690
We can also add an addition on,

960
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,330
so we can sort the printing now

961
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:21,190
and maybe do an addendum after
we get a positive decision.

962
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:23,080
So we're working on a lot of things

963
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,743
including an executive order.

964
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:26,893
- Well it should go without saying

965
00:39:26,893 --> 00:39:29,360
that you cannot overrule
a Supreme Court decision

966
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,860
with an executive order.

967
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,693
Should go without saying

968
00:39:31,693 --> 00:39:32,630
but I guess we still have to say it.

969
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:34,767
Joining me now is MSNBC
legal analyst Maya Wiley.

970
00:39:34,767 --> 00:39:37,940
@AdamSerwer of The
Atlantic and Latosha Brown,

971
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,580
co-founder of Black Voters Matter.

972
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:44,060
Maya, can one overrule a
Supreme Court decision,

973
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,530
I'll just have you answer it,

974
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:48,320
by having an executive order?

975
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,153
- No!

976
00:39:50,731 --> 00:39:52,050
(laughs)
- Excellent!

977
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:53,950
So let's move on to the next question.

978
00:39:55,225 --> 00:39:56,058
- No I mean but seriously--
- I think it's important

979
00:39:56,058 --> 00:39:56,891
just to make it clear.

980
00:39:56,891 --> 00:39:58,300
- Well I think what's
really important here

981
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:02,440
is even Justice Roberts in his opinion,

982
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:07,100
said that judicial review is
not just an empty vehicle.

983
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,610
That it has to have meaning.

984
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:11,010
He was explicit in the opinion.

985
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:15,340
Think about this, a Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court

986
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:18,700
felt the need to say that in an opinion.

987
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:22,770
That is astounding and
Donald Trump has proven

988
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:26,030
why it was necessary to say.

989
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:28,030
Department of Justice lawyers right now

990
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:30,500
are trying to figure out how to do

991
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,440
what they have an oath to do,

992
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,880
which is uphold the laws
of the United States.

993
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,880
And there is no higher
legal vehicle in the land

994
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,530
in terms of how to
understand our constitution

995
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:45,673
or interpret our statutes,
than the Supreme Court.

996
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,350
- And you know Adam,

997
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:50,760
there's the story that's
sort of enveloping here

998
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,860
is that Donald Trump gets slapped down

999
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:52,693
by the Supreme Court.

1000
00:40:52,693 --> 00:40:55,670
He then is canoodling with
his friends on the far-right

1001
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:56,700
and maybe the alt-right,

1002
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:00,970
maybe the people from his
former folks like Steve Bannon,

1003
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:02,350
whoever he was talking to.

1004
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:04,160
Then he gets mad, he
does this tweet storm,

1005
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,810
where he says that it's fake,

1006
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:08,020
that they're not gonna
fight to get this question

1007
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,720
onto the census. So he
puts up that as true,

1008
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,400
which is just a straight out lie.

1009
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,603
And now you have the Department of Justice

1010
00:41:13,603 --> 00:41:16,600
twisting itself into knots to
try to figure out a way to do

1011
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,970
what they've been told to do,

1012
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:19,070
which is to still find a way

1013
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:21,130
to get this issue onto the census.

1014
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:23,770
And we know from the
reporting that's out there

1015
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:25,560
that the original reason for it

1016
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,700
was that they wanted to defund

1017
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,460
areas that had a lot of immigrants in it,

1018
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,570
especially non-white immigrants.

1019
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:32,740
They wanna give white voters an advantage

1020
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,160
by only counting citizens knowing that,

1021
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,700
something like 6.5 million people

1022
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,723
probably wouldn't even answer
the census if it was on there.

1023
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:41,400
The fact that they're
making it this blatant,

1024
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,253
your thoughts.

1025
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,140
- Well, I just wanna say one thing.

1026
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,390
This is not a question of far-right,

1027
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:49,470
this is the Republican establishment

1028
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:54,470
that hatched this scheme for
weakening the voting influence

1029
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,740
of voters of color to
increase white voting power.

1030
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:01,150
This is an absolutely
establishment Republican scheme

1031
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:03,750
that Donald Trump recognizes is important

1032
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:04,840
if the Republican Party

1033
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,980
wants to keep winning in elections

1034
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,270
in a diversifying country.

1035
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:09,650
They need to figure out a way

1036
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:11,960
to make white votes count more.

1037
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,980
And when they went to the Supreme Court,

1038
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,970
they gave them a fictional reason

1039
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:17,820
and of all the conservative justices

1040
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,620
on the Supreme Court, only Roberts

1041
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,740
was willing to say it was fictional.

1042
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:24,200
The other Supreme Court justices

1043
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,970
said that the plaintiffs were acting

1044
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:29,240
like conspiracy theorists in suggesting

1045
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,730
that the Commerce Secretary was lying.

1046
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:33,430
Well now the president has confirmed it.

1047
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:36,170
This is about districting,
this is about diluting

1048
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:37,280
the minority vote.

1049
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,630
This is not about enforcing
the Voting Rights Act.

1050
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:41,820
And everyone knew that was a pretext.

1051
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:45,330
But what they tried to do was
not simply lie to the court.

1052
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:47,270
Not simply lie to the American people

1053
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:49,150
but tell them the thing
that they were seeing

1054
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,243
in front of their eyes was false.

1055
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:54,437
- Yeah, and just to show you all the,

1056
00:42:54,437 --> 00:42:55,810
and thank you for making that point

1057
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:57,270
because this has been a long term thing

1058
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:59,480
trying to game and game
and game the system

1059
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,230
because they know
demographics are changing

1060
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:02,990
and they don't want it
to change their power,

1061
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:04,810
lemme just play the Donald Trump soundbite

1062
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:06,020
that goes with what Adam was just saying

1063
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,580
which is where Donald Trump admits

1064
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:09,080
that it's about districting.

1065
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,210
It's about using the census to increase

1066
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:13,060
the power of his side, take a listen.

1067
00:43:14,354 --> 00:43:15,560
- Well you need it for many reasons.

1068
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,800
Number one you need it for Congress,

1069
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,970
you need it for Congress, for districting.

1070
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:22,310
You need it for appropriations,

1071
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:25,170
where are the funds going,
how many people are there?

1072
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:27,760
Are they citizens, are they not citizens?

1073
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,210
You need it for many reasons.

1074
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:32,320
- Maya, normally when
somebody is that blatant

1075
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,840
about admitting that their whole reason

1076
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,760
that they're saying they're going

1077
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,310
in front of the court for is a lie,

1078
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:37,260
that would be the end of it.

1079
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:38,980
But Donald Trump has gotten
away with this before.

1080
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:41,130
He said that the Muslim
ban was a Muslim ban

1081
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:42,600
and then he said, no, no, I didn't mean it

1082
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,050
and the court pretended he never said it.

1083
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:46,770
So, do we have a risk here,
that the partisans on the court

1084
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:47,870
and maybe that includes Roberts.

1085
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:50,203
He's not been a huge fan of voting rights.

1086
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:52,770
Could they just change their reason

1087
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:55,433
and then slide this right
past the Supreme Court?

1088
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:01,160
- It's a little bit
complicated but procedurally.

1089
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,960
But let's say this, one of the things

1090
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,760
that Chief Justice Roberts did,

1091
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:08,990
was spent about 22 pages
saying why the administration

1092
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:12,020
could put this question on the census

1093
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:15,540
despite the fact that the careerists,

1094
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:18,120
the people who behave
in a non-partisan way

1095
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,870
in the Census Bureau said no,

1096
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:21,730
we don't think this question should go on

1097
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:24,470
in order to do what we
need to do as a census.

1098
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:27,420
That's really important
and what the minority

1099
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:30,010
on the court said, what the
liberals on the court said

1100
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:32,850
was, we actually don't
think the whole first part

1101
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:34,510
of that opinion is right.

1102
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:37,160
We think that this
arbitrary and capricious

1103
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,920
which is the legal language for,

1104
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,550
aint no reason for this, no good reason.

1105
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:45,540
That the fact that the
careerists said, no this is bad,

1106
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:47,420
means it shouldn't happen.

1107
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:49,270
And just one more thing I just wanna add.

1108
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:51,870
2010, Republicans underfunded this census

1109
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:53,563
even before Trump was elected.

1110
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,560
- Yeah absolutely and they
sort of made war on it.

1111
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,780
Let me go to you quickly Natasha,

1112
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,690
because well how will
this look on the ground?

1113
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:02,340
If people are afraid to
answer the census, then what?

1114
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,910
- I think part of the problem if people

1115
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:08,590
are afraid to answer the census,

1116
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:09,580
what you're gonna see is you're gonna see

1117
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:10,730
a gross under-count.

1118
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:12,300
You're gonna particularly
see an under-count

1119
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,590
in communities of color
and the challenge with that

1120
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:17,900
is there over $800 million of aid

1121
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:20,600
that is actually, goes by census data.

1122
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,367
So you'll see a gross
under-count because of this.

1123
00:45:23,367 --> 00:45:24,850
But I think that there's another issue

1124
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:26,710
that I just wanna raise
around the president.

1125
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:28,810
That we really have a rogue president

1126
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:30,950
that in this process in particular,

1127
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:34,210
here is executive that's saying that

1128
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:36,430
immediately after the
Supreme Court ruling,

1129
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:39,510
he's actually saying that I'm
considering these options.

1130
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:44,170
One, I'm considering this
option around executive order

1131
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:45,320
and then the second thing he's saying

1132
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,710
he's considering the option
of having an addendum.

1133
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:50,880
This is a president that
does not even respect

1134
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,260
the law of the land.

1135
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:54,730
I really think that we're
in a constitutional crisis

1136
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:56,740
and we don't need to
act like this is normal.

1137
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:59,480
This is not normal,
this is not acceptable.

1138
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:02,250
This is beyond, he took a oath

1139
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:05,950
and swore that he would actually
uphold the law of the land.

1140
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:08,370
Yet we're seeing this
play out very differently.

1141
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:09,970
I think we need to make the distinction

1142
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:12,080
that here it is, that immediately

1143
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,590
after the Supreme Court made a decision,

1144
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:16,770
he says that he's going to do

1145
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:18,500
whatever he wants to do anyway

1146
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,300
and we've gotta take that seriously.

1147
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:22,183
- Yeah absolutely!

1148
00:46:22,183 --> 00:46:23,016
Well hopefully there's a plan.

1149
00:46:23,016 --> 00:46:24,230
We're gonna have you guys come back

1150
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:25,063
and talk about this more.

1151
00:46:25,063 --> 00:46:26,097
Maya and Adam will be back,

1152
00:46:26,097 --> 00:46:27,340
and Latosha Brown we'll have you back

1153
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:28,800
to talk about what the plan is gonna be

1154
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,820
if he's somehow able to thwart the law.

1155
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:31,653
All right, and coming up,

(dramatic music)

1254
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:31,867
- 52% of the force is Latino.

1255
00:50:31,867 --> 00:50:33,550
And a lot of people ask me,

1256
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:37,400
how do they get Latino people
then to behave this way

1257
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,450
against people who are their own heritage

1258
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:40,610
and their own culture?

1259
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:42,520
And it's because in the academy,

1260
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:45,870
they mandate and they teach the agents

1261
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:48,270
to use racist terms for migrants

1262
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:50,250
so that they see these people as other

1263
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:51,770
and that they're not like them.

1264
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:53,770
It does have an effect.

1265
00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:56,830
It's condoned, and when it happens

1266
00:50:56,830 --> 00:50:58,490
and if somebody complains,

1267
00:50:58,490 --> 00:50:59,960
everybody groups together,

1268
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:04,960
specifically more the male side
and they protect each other.

1269
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:10,010
- A second formerly secret Facebook group

1270
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:11,600
frequented by current and former

1271
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:15,260
Customs and Border Patrol
agents has been unearthed.

1272
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:17,650
CNN obtained screenshots from two sources

1273
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:19,380
familiar with the Facebook pages

1274
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:21,860
that contain vulgar and
sexually explicit posts

1275
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:24,180
mocking migrants and demeaning lawmakers

1276
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:26,820
like Congresswoman
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

1277
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:28,360
It comes on the heels of a separate,

1278
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:31,750
secret Facebook group that
was exposed earlier this week.

1279
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:33,750
NBC News has not independently verified

1280
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:36,270
these Facebook groups or posts

1281
00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:38,790
and back with me Maya
Wiley and Adam Serwer.

1282
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:43,380
Adam, you have posts
like feeling kinda cute,

1283
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:47,190
might separate some families today, IDK,

1284
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:48,420
for I don't know.

1285
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:50,490
You have another group member

1286
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:52,610
that was apparently on these posts,

1287
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:54,070
who posted a photo of the father

1288
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:55,280
and his 23-month old daughter,

1289
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,200
they both died lying
face down the Rio Grande.

1290
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,610
Asked if the photo could have been faked

1291
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:01,820
because the bodies were so quote, clean.

1292
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:03,300
It goes on and on and on

1293
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:04,640
and as you just heard in that soundbite,

1294
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:05,970
some of these are actually Latino.

1295
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:08,540
It's not all only white
members of the CBP.

1296
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:10,623
What the heck is going on in your view?

1297
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:15,010
- Well anytime you give
one group of people

1298
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:17,370
authority over another group of people

1299
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:19,420
you run the risk that
the people with authority

1300
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:21,540
are gonna see themselves as above

1301
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:24,650
or better than the people
who they have authority over.

1302
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:26,470
And the way you mitigate
that in a democracy

1303
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:28,160
is you say, well these
people are public servants.

1304
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,970
They are actually employed by the public,

1305
00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:33,070
they don't lord over the public.

1306
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:34,790
And the problem with that is that

1307
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:36,860
if you create a culture of impunity

1308
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:40,060
where public servants who
have that kind of authority

1309
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:42,180
particularly the authority
over life and death

1310
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:43,800
are never held accountable

1311
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,370
when they abuse that authority,

1312
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:48,380
then they begin to
rationalize those abuses

1313
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:50,920
as somehow justified or necessary.

1314
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,420
And I think that that's
what we're seeing here

1315
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:54,600
particularly with the Trump administration

1316
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,970
imposing policies that are cruel beyond

1317
00:52:57,970 --> 00:53:00,190
what we've seen in
previous administrations

1318
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:02,380
even when those administrations
have been strict

1319
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:03,700
on immigration enforcement.

1320
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:05,790
And the people who
carry out those policies

1321
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:07,720
have to be able to figure out a way

1322
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,750
to justify what they're doing

1323
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:11,620
and one way that they do that

1324
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:14,060
is by denying the humanity of the people

1325
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:16,363
that they have authority over.

1326
00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:20,420
- Yeah you know, the
dehumanization of these folks,

1327
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:22,850
it did remind me, Chris
Hayes put up a post

1328
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:25,170
and it brings back the memories of the way

1329
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:28,130
people treated others
during the invasion of Iraq.

1330
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:29,650
The sense of, these aren't even people.

1331
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:32,010
Or in our own past, the way that people

1332
00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:33,550
were able to treat others,

1333
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:35,190
whether it's from enslavement on

1334
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:36,200
but they're just not people

1335
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,770
so we don't have to think
of them as human beings.

1336
00:53:38,770 --> 00:53:40,960
You have this Customs and
Border protection spokesperson

1337
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,170
saying this does not
reflect the values of CBP.

1338
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:44,160
How can that even be true?

1339
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,270
They're two different groups,

1340
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:48,070
where people are making this
kinds of mockeries, Maya.

1341
00:53:48,070 --> 00:53:49,920
- Yeah, it's clearly not true.

1342
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,490
I think assuming all
these posts are accurate

1343
00:53:52,490 --> 00:53:54,300
but we have no reason
to believe they aren't

1344
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,810
because there was a 2018 exposure,

1345
00:53:56,810 --> 00:53:59,240
the Facebook groups existed in 2018

1346
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:03,030
and I think part of the problem
here exactly what Adam said

1347
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:06,490
is the leadership has to say,

1348
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:10,810
not only is this not who
we are as an institution,

1349
00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:13,840
it is not what we will
tolerate as managers.

1350
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:15,310
And that's critically important.

1351
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:18,500
If you don't take action
where you have the authority

1352
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:21,060
to take action against employees.

1353
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:23,620
In this case there is an ability

1354
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:26,110
to take disciplinary action,

1355
00:54:26,110 --> 00:54:28,470
if there's inappropriate
social media activity.

1356
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:31,050
You have to balance that
with First Amendment Rights

1357
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:33,620
of course, but here the question is,

1358
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:37,400
people who have the
ability, who are armed,

1359
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:41,900
who can actually violate the
human rights of other people

1360
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:43,850
must be held to account,

1361
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:46,520
when they're essentially
dehumanizing in a way,

1362
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:49,350
that really undermines the
effectiveness of the agency

1363
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:51,290
which is supposed to be impartial.

1364
00:54:51,290 --> 00:54:53,410
Remember that people coming to the border

1365
00:54:53,410 --> 00:54:56,390
have a lawful right based
in international law

1366
00:54:56,390 --> 00:54:59,420
as well as US law to seek asylum

1367
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:03,250
and the dehumanization is both offensive

1368
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:05,910
but it also fundamentally undermines

1369
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:09,360
the role that they are
to play at the border

1370
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,510
and we should be very
concerned about that.

1371
00:55:13,952 --> 00:55:14,950
- I think I quote you every week Adam.

1372
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:15,783
The cruelty is the point.

1373
00:55:15,783 --> 00:55:17,140
Like that's why they're doing it.

1374
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:18,700
His base wants to see this.

1375
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:21,130
And so he's showing them
that he can dehumanize them.

1376
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:23,390
Isn't that message coming
from the White House?

1377
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:25,100
That essentially you don't
have to treat these people

1378
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:27,250
like human beings, who cares?

1379
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:29,581
- I do think the message is
coming from the White House

1380
00:55:29,581 --> 00:55:31,620
that these people are
not real human beings

1381
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:33,490
and you don't have to treat them properly.

1382
00:55:33,490 --> 00:55:36,340
I will say though, that
when it comes to children

1383
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:38,830
that the administration is very aware

1384
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:43,340
that its policies are at
their political weakest point

1385
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:46,070
when people see these images
of children being abused

1386
00:55:46,070 --> 00:55:50,480
or being held in dehumanizing conditions.

1387
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,830
With the adults it's a little different.

1388
00:55:51,830 --> 00:55:53,730
The president likes to brag about

1389
00:55:53,730 --> 00:55:55,390
how he's gonna deport a million people

1390
00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:57,230
and they're gonna do a
crackdown and all that stuff.

1391
00:55:57,230 --> 00:55:58,360
But when it comes to the children,

1392
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:00,250
I actually think they recognize

1393
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:02,330
that this is damaging for them

1394
00:56:02,330 --> 00:56:05,370
among everyone but the most
hardcore Trump supporters

1395
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:07,370
who would defend anything
the president did

1396
00:56:07,370 --> 00:56:08,873
no matter how horrendous.

1397
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:11,770
- Yeah, but they're not
doing anything about it Maya.

1398
00:56:11,770 --> 00:56:13,520
That doesn't mean that
they're changing it.

1399
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:14,900
They won't let these kids go.

1400
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:16,600
That is the thing that
keeps striking me Maya,

1401
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:17,820
they wot let them go.

1402
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:20,410
They're holding them for
almost 60 days in some point,

1403
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:21,950
they just won't let them go.
- They won't let them go.

1404
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:24,040
- If they see that it's wrong,
why don't they let 'em go?

1405
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,940
- They won't let them
go and they're actually,

1406
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:29,900
remember we have that
astounding appearance in court

1407
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:32,480
where they were in violation
of the settlement agreement

1408
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:36,453
and said, oh well, we don't
even have to provide soap.

1409
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,420
- Yeah, and they moved
them to another facility

1410
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:42,480
because they knew that
the cameras were coming,

1411
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:43,910
mocked the members of Congress

1412
00:56:43,910 --> 00:56:46,230
in front of the
supervisors who did nothing

1413
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:47,940
and then moved the kids right back in.

1414
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:49,160
If they really believe that,

1415
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:50,100
if they say they're gonna deport

1416
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:52,810
they're not even doing
that, anyway it's insane.

1417
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:53,980
Anyway, Maya will be right back.

1418
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:55,520
Adam Serwer thank you very much.

1419
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,910
I really appreciate and
I'll keep on quoting you.

1420
00:56:57,910 --> 00:56:59,310

1449
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:08,610

1465
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:40,230
Your makeup will never look flawless

1466
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:42,860
if it's sitting on top of
dead skin and peach fuzz

1467
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:45,360
but Dermaplane Glo exfoliates that layer

with the people's stories

1491
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:45,610
that I'm listening to,
that's an inspiration.

1492
00:59:45,610 --> 00:59:46,870
- It's on during my commute,

1493
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:48,860
it's on all the time.

1494
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:49,780

00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:55,270
that wants to broaden their mind.

1500
00:59:55,270 --> 00:59:56,620
- [Woman] People who
are tired of listening

1501
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:58,160
to their radio or music.

1502
00:59:58,160 --> 00:59:59,770
- To hear her speak those words--

1503
00:59:59,770 --> 01:00:01,270

01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:02,440

1505
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,460

1509

01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:39,630
- I know predators and we have a predator

1519
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:41,291
living in the White House.

1520
01:00:41,291 --> 01:00:43,160
(crowd cheering)

1521
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:45,360
And the thing about
predators you should know

1522
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:47,263
is that they prey on the vulnerable.

1523
01:00:48,450 --> 01:00:52,383
They prey on those who they
do not believe are strong.

1524
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:54,900
- Welcome back to AM Joy.

1525
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:57,110
We're almost three years
after Hillary Clinton

1526
01:00:57,110 --> 01:00:59,100
became the first woman
presidential nominee

1527
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:01,790
of a major US political party.

1528
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:05,360
We now have six women running
for president in 2020.

1529
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,330
Among the, Senator Kamala Harris,

1530
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:10,430
who along with calling
Donald Trump a predator,

1531
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:14,040
shared exactly why she says
that she has the credibility

1532
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:14,893
to take him down.

1533
01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:19,540
- I've had a lot of fights,
most which I've won.

1534
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:21,320
I know how to fight and let me tell you,

1535
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:22,460
we're gonna also need somebody

1536
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:24,490
who can successfully prosecute the case

1537
01:01:24,490 --> 01:01:27,170
against another four years
of that administration.

1538
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:28,383
I know how to do that.

1539
01:01:29,950 --> 01:01:32,080
- Senator Harris, along with
Senator Elizabeth Warren

1540
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:35,390
saw their stocks soar
in new national polls,

1541
01:01:35,390 --> 01:01:37,350
after the first presidential debates.

1542
01:01:37,350 --> 01:01:39,420
A Quinnipiac poll that
was released just Tuesday

1543
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:42,010
showed Harris surging 13 points

1544
01:01:42,010 --> 01:01:43,980
since last month into second place,

1545
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:47,010
only two points behind
front runner Joe Biden.

1546
01:01:47,010 --> 01:01:48,810
That after Harris challenged Biden

1547
01:01:48,810 --> 01:01:51,460
over his comments about
working with segregationist

1548
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:54,870
senators and his opposition
to federally mandated busing

1549
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:56,650
in the 1970s.

1550
01:01:56,650 --> 01:01:59,830
When asked which candidate
did the best job at the debate

1551
01:01:59,830 --> 01:02:02,410
47% said Harris, and she was followed

1552
01:02:02,410 --> 01:02:05,670
by Senator Elizabeth Warren with 17%.

1553
01:02:05,670 --> 01:02:08,410
Only 6% said that former
vice president Biden

1554
01:02:08,410 --> 01:02:10,170
had the best performance.

1555
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:12,170
And when asked which candidate

1556
01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:16,450
has the best policy ideas,
Warren took the lead with 31%

1557
01:02:16,450 --> 01:02:18,820
compared to 19% in April.

1558
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:22,030
Sanders came in at 18%
while Biden received 11%

1559
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:25,190
a drop from 23 in April.

1560
01:02:25,190 --> 01:02:26,760
Now despite these numbers Biden remains

1561
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:28,920
the nominal front runner, even if barely

1562
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:31,350
and the changes in the
standings in the race

1563
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:33,670
are re-upping the question
of whether America

1564
01:02:33,670 --> 01:02:36,940
is finally, finally ready
to elect a woman president.

1565
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:39,050
There are now six options, most of them

1566
01:02:39,050 --> 01:02:42,420
more politically experienced
and savvy than Trump.

1567
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:44,030
So if not now then when.

1568
01:02:44,030 --> 01:02:46,030
Maya Wiley of The New
School is back with me.

1569
01:02:46,030 --> 01:02:48,100

of the Dean Obeidallah Show

1573
01:02:53,490 --> 01:02:54,450
on SiriusXM.

1574
01:02:54,450 --> 01:02:55,500
I'm gonna go to you first Rashad,

1575
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,230
glad I just ran into you last night,

1576
01:02:57,230 --> 01:02:58,950
watching Missy Elliott here (laughs)

1577
01:02:58,950 --> 01:03:03,160
at the Essence Festival
25th Anniversary, hey!

1578
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:04,980
And so I'm wondering if you had a chance.

1579
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:06,070
I don't know when you got here

1580
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:08,000
but I don't know if you've
had a chance to walk around

1581
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,610
and have conversations with people

1582
01:03:09,610 --> 01:03:11,550
that you're running into
down here at Essence.

1583
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:12,870
Tell me what you're hearing.

1584
01:03:12,870 --> 01:03:17,300
Is the Kamala boom
resonating in the real world

1585
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:21,139
or is this just us people
who are obsessed with polls?

1586
01:03:21,139 --> 01:03:22,466
- I think it's a mix of both.

1587
01:03:22,466 --> 01:03:25,100
I think it's one, it is people
that are obsessed with polls

1588
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:27,020
and those of us in the political class

1589
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:29,470
who follow these things,
are sort of deeply invested

1590
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:31,580
in looking at the
upticks and the downticks

1591
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:33,850
but people are coming to understand

1592
01:03:33,850 --> 01:03:35,410
who Kamala Harris is,

1593
01:03:35,410 --> 01:03:37,280
and understanding her track record.

1594
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,130
And paying closer attention to us

1595
01:03:39,130 --> 01:03:40,940
and that's the power of these debates.

1596
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:43,630
I also am hearing Elizabeth
warren's name a lot.

1597
01:03:43,630 --> 01:03:45,970
From a number of people as I walk around

1598
01:03:45,970 --> 01:03:48,180
and particularly the way
that she's rolled out

1599
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:52,000
a set of plans and exactly
how she's talking about

1600
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,750
how she's going to close some of the gaps

1601
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:57,130
that have plagued communities for so long.

1602
01:03:57,130 --> 01:03:59,250
I do think it's just incredibly early

1603
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:04,250
and even the sort of ticks
and hits that Biden has taken

1604
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:07,510
to his polls is a recognition that,

1605
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:09,370
many of his early numbers,

1606
01:04:09,370 --> 01:04:11,043
were just that people knew who he was.

1607
01:04:11,043 --> 01:04:14,300
It's like going into
a store, a supermarket

1608
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:17,020
and you pick the product off the shelf

1609
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:18,760
that you've seen the most commercials for,

1610
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:20,840
that you know you have
the most attention to

1611
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:22,460
but over time you might change that

1612
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:23,660
as you learn more things.

1613
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:26,230
And so I do think that
it's just really early

1614
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:27,800
but I do think that these debates

1615
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,710
are shifting the landscape
and giving people

1616
01:04:29,710 --> 01:04:33,060
more on opportunity to see
candidates in a different way.

1617
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:34,490
- Yeah, and that's a
very good point Tiffany

1618
01:04:34,490 --> 01:04:37,550
because there is a certain huge advantage

1619
01:04:37,550 --> 01:04:39,500
that Biden had just because
people knew who he is.

1620
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:41,810
And people didn't know who a
lot of these candidates were

1621
01:04:41,810 --> 01:04:44,630
until like 23 million people
watched that second debate

1622
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:46,350
and said, oh she's interesting.

1623
01:04:46,350 --> 01:04:49,947
I wonder if you think that
there's also a potential though

1624
01:04:49,947 --> 01:04:51,270
that's it's a little deeper

1625
01:04:51,270 --> 01:04:53,250
and that it might be more like 2008.

1626
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:54,500
Where people didn't really know

1627
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:55,660
who Barack Obama was either

1628
01:04:55,660 --> 01:04:57,850
but when they saw him in comparison

1629
01:04:57,850 --> 01:04:59,780
and realized that he was plausible.

1630
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:00,750
I mean, look at these numbers,

1631
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:05,020
Biden is now only two points
ahead in this latest polls.

1632
01:05:05,020 --> 01:05:06,040
Right, in Quinnipiac.

1633
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:07,310
She's only tow points down from him.

1634
01:05:07,310 --> 01:05:08,660
Warren is right up there.

1635
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:11,150
She's passed Bernie Sanders, is now at 14,

1636
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:13,800
statistically tied but
one point ahead of him.

1637
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:16,290
She's gone up 13, Harris.

1638
01:05:16,290 --> 01:05:17,300
Biden's gone down eight.

1639
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:20,250
It looks like she's
taking that lead from him

1640
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:22,330
and I wonder if he's maybe
a bit too comfortable

1641
01:05:22,330 --> 01:05:24,290
assuming I'm the guy black voters like.

1642
01:05:24,290 --> 01:05:26,620
But if you even look
among African-Americans,

1643
01:05:26,620 --> 01:05:28,700
here's that next poll,
she's only you know,

1644
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:31,270
four points down among African-Americans.

1645
01:05:31,270 --> 01:05:32,103
It's a huge change.

1646
01:05:32,103 --> 01:05:35,230
It feels a little bit like Barack Obama

1647
01:05:35,230 --> 01:05:37,130
versus Hillary Clinton in that '08 primary

1648
01:05:37,130 --> 01:05:39,240
or am I reading too much into it, Tiffany?

1649
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:42,310
- Oh well, first let me
say I have serious FOMO

1650
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:44,370
that all you guys are
at the Essence Festival

1651
01:05:44,370 --> 01:05:45,510
and I'm missing out.

1652
01:05:45,510 --> 01:05:47,210
I don't wanna hear about Missy Elliott,

1653
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:49,625
I'm not there, I have
FOMO, I don't like it.

1654
01:05:49,625 --> 01:05:51,697
(loud laughter)

1655
01:05:51,697 --> 01:05:54,410
But, back to the issue at
hand, back to the point.

1656
01:05:54,410 --> 01:05:56,850
I think a lot of the, so many people

1657
01:05:56,850 --> 01:05:59,940
put how they feel about these candidates

1658
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:02,490
through the lens of cable news networks.

1659
01:06:02,490 --> 01:06:04,600
And so when you have people offering

1660
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:06,970
analysis and how they
feel even after debate,

1661
01:06:06,970 --> 01:06:09,070
a lot of times that conversation is driven

1662
01:06:09,070 --> 01:06:11,580
by a media lacking in diversity.

1663
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:13,250
Ethnic diversity, diversity of thoughts,

1664
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:15,730
socioeconomic diversity and so people

1665
01:06:15,730 --> 01:06:18,330
tend to look through this very myopic lens

1666
01:06:18,330 --> 01:06:19,540
about debate performances.

1667
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:22,070
Even the conversations
that follow the debates,

1668
01:06:22,070 --> 01:06:24,590
it became again all
about Elizabeth Warren,

1669
01:06:24,590 --> 01:06:26,010
Kamala Harris and Joe Biden.

1670
01:06:26,010 --> 01:06:29,310
We forget that Julian Castro
had an amazing performance.

1671
01:06:29,310 --> 01:06:32,610
He's a very overlooked candidate I think.

1672
01:06:32,610 --> 01:06:34,540
So I think we have to
look at this full scope

1673
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:37,300
to Rashad's point, it is still
very early in the process.

1674
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:38,780
You and I talk about this a lot Joy.

1675
01:06:38,780 --> 01:06:40,340
You know how I feel about the polls.

1676
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:42,639
You have to consider, polls are mostly

1677
01:06:42,639 --> 01:06:45,320
older Americans, people
who answer landlines.

1678
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:48,350
People who answer landlines
from an unidentified caller.

1679
01:06:48,350 --> 01:06:50,280
You're not gonna have a
lot of people doing that

1680
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:52,310
and we have to disaggregate the data.

1681
01:06:52,310 --> 01:06:56,580
Look, I think Kamala Harris
is a very electable candidate.

1682
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:59,080
There are other members
in this very crowded slate

1683
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:01,220
who are electable and the American people

1684
01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:03,150
will ultimately say yeah.

1685
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:05,400
Ultimately you can't put all your credence

1686
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:06,233
into what polls are saying

1687
01:07:06,233 --> 01:07:09,230
and what media analysts even say.

1688
01:07:09,230 --> 01:07:11,400
And so we have to, there's
another debate coming up

1689
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:12,620
at the end of July.

1690
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:14,750
We have to look at this in a more,

1691
01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:17,710
I think wider lens than
what sometimes offered

1692
01:07:17,710 --> 01:07:19,623
in some of these mainstream outlets.

1693
01:07:21,798 --> 01:07:22,850
- I agree with you 'cause we
talk about this all the time

1694
01:07:22,850 --> 01:07:24,290
but I have to say and I'm
gonna go to Dean on this

1695
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:25,670
because here's the challenge.

1696
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:27,800
Everything that Tiffany just said is true.

1697
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:29,480
But, most people don't have time

1698
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:30,340
to follow all this stuff.

1699
01:07:30,340 --> 01:07:31,480
They don't have time
to follow all the polls

1700
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:34,150
so they look at the polls, they
listen to us talk about it.

1701
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:36,020
You talk about the great debate

1702
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:38,730
that Julian Castro had, he
didn't move in the polls

1703
01:07:38,730 --> 01:07:40,630
and so then it feeds on itself.

1704
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:42,270
And so that next debate comes around

1705
01:07:42,270 --> 01:07:43,950
and he had a great debate
but he didn't move.

1706
01:07:43,950 --> 01:07:45,680
And so the thing is
people are trying to think

1707
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:48,880
I gotta narrow these 800
people down to like four.

1708
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:51,070
Right, they gotta stop thinking
about it as four or five,

1709
01:07:51,070 --> 01:07:51,903
instead of 40.

1710
01:07:51,903 --> 01:07:54,620
The next debate, do you think
maybe the Democratic Party

1711
01:07:54,620 --> 01:07:56,620
ought to narrow it down a little bit?

1712
01:07:56,620 --> 01:07:57,700
It would eliminate somebody

1713
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:59,277
who's not polling very
high like Julian Castro

1714
01:07:59,277 --> 01:08:00,660
who had a contribution to make

1715
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:03,200
but do you think it's bad,
for us to now do another

1716
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,750
23 people in the debate.

1717
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:06,440
- I think let this July debates,

1718
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:08,450
it's basically set right now, go forward.

1719
01:08:08,450 --> 01:08:11,960
The next debate, September,
already the field is smaller.

1720
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:14,370
But look, this is going to be a battle.

1721
01:08:14,370 --> 01:08:16,390
Donald Trump talked about
it on the 4th of July.

1722
01:08:16,390 --> 01:08:19,620
Like when the Revolutionary
Army took the airports,

1723
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:21,260
this that kind of battle
we're talking about.

1724
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:24,013
The battle of LaGuardia, en route to JFK.

1725
01:08:24,013 --> 01:08:24,846
This is the kind of
fight we're talking about

1726
01:08:24,846 --> 01:08:26,660
that's gonna happen between now

1727
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:28,860
and November 2020.

1728
01:08:28,860 --> 01:08:30,960
But internally in Democratic Party,

1729
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:32,900
things are gonna change,
they're gonna move.

1730
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,600
People want someone to win.

1731
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,800
My listeners who call my show,

1732
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,380
there are three factors they want

1733
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:39,340
in a Democratic nominee.

1734
01:08:39,340 --> 01:08:40,930
Who can beat Trump, who can beat Trump

1735
01:08:40,930 --> 01:08:42,010
and who can beat Trump.

1736
01:08:42,010 --> 01:08:44,190
That is the key and they say every time,

1737
01:08:44,190 --> 01:08:45,860
vote blue no matter who.

1738
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:47,830
So they'll say whoever
I'm supporting is fine.

1739
01:08:47,830 --> 01:08:49,230
I'm gonna fight for that person

1740
01:08:49,230 --> 01:08:51,570
but we're gonna unite and
win against Donald Trump.

1741
01:08:51,570 --> 01:08:52,980
But the more polls you see

1742
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:54,780
where Senator Harris can beat Trump,

1743
01:08:54,780 --> 01:08:57,360
the more polls you see where
Senator Warren can beat Trump,

1744
01:08:57,360 --> 01:08:59,340
and not just Biden can beat Trump.

1745
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:01,630
It makes them more electable,

1746
01:09:01,630 --> 01:09:04,770
and I think undercuts
the idea that Joe Biden

1747
01:09:04,770 --> 01:09:06,340
is the only one electable.

1748
01:09:06,340 --> 01:09:07,670
And the more that happens,

1749
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:09,780
I think the more Joe
Biden potentially slides.

1750
01:09:09,780 --> 01:09:12,480
He could still be the nominee,
but potentially slides.

1751
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:15,190
- Putting aside the fact
that Dean Obeidallah

1752
01:09:15,190 --> 01:09:19,670
brought up the battle in
which George Washington

1753
01:09:19,670 --> 01:09:23,790
used his fighter planes to
bomb the British front line

1754
01:09:23,790 --> 01:09:26,770
during that first battle
to take over the airports

1755
01:09:26,770 --> 01:09:27,603
during the Revolutionary War,

1756
01:09:27,603 --> 01:09:28,680
we're gonna put that aside for a moment.

1757
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:30,700
We're gonna come back to
politics for a minute Maya Wiley,

1758
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:32,610
because the other issue here too

1759
01:09:32,610 --> 01:09:34,250
is that because as Dean said,

1760
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:35,760
it's been seen as Biden's the only one

1761
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:36,640
who can beat Trump.

1762
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,920
Because there has been this idea

1763
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:40,810
even among African-Americans
that it's gotta be a white guy.

1764
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:42,070
It's the only guy who can beat Trump.

1765
01:09:42,070 --> 01:09:44,820
But when you see her beat him in a debate,

1766
01:09:44,820 --> 01:09:46,690
doesn't that make people kinda wonder

1767
01:09:46,690 --> 01:09:49,220
well wait a minute, if he can't beat her

1768
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:51,150
maybe this woman actually is the one

1769
01:09:51,150 --> 01:09:53,330
who can take Donald Trump down.

1770
01:09:53,330 --> 01:09:55,163
- Yeah, I think that's right.

1771
01:09:55,163 --> 01:09:57,470
I think one of the things
that's happening here is,

1772
01:09:57,470 --> 01:09:59,700
this is sort of a national trauma

1773
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:03,410
around Donald Trump having
won the 2016 election.

1774
01:10:03,410 --> 01:10:05,450
Remember that Hillary Clinton did win

1775
01:10:05,450 --> 01:10:07,740
by almost three million votes.

1776
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:09,710
Then what she lost was
the electoral college

1777
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:13,580
and she lost that by basically
three states in the Midwest.

1778
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:16,390
It was Pennsylvania,
Wisconsin and Michigan

1779
01:10:16,390 --> 01:10:19,930
and so that's where the,
oh we-need-a-white-man fear

1780
01:10:19,930 --> 01:10:22,650
comes from, but I also think the fact that

1781
01:10:22,650 --> 01:10:27,360
voters voted for Donald Trump
despite his overt sexism

1782
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:29,140
is part of why we are starting to hear

1783
01:10:29,140 --> 01:10:30,830
what I think is a very dangerous debate

1784
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:32,850
about is a woman electable?

1785
01:10:32,850 --> 01:10:34,290
And what we don't talk,

1786
01:10:34,290 --> 01:10:36,560
as much about is, is a
black woman electable?

1787
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:38,460
Because I think part of what's happening

1788
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:42,550
is this notion that the
only way we win the office

1789
01:10:42,550 --> 01:10:45,090
is by actually sacrificing who we are

1790
01:10:45,090 --> 01:10:46,370
when all of the fundamentals

1791
01:10:46,370 --> 01:10:48,430
show that absolutely women

1792
01:10:48,430 --> 01:10:51,270
and women of all races are electable.

1793
01:10:51,270 --> 01:10:52,920
That's what 2018 taught us

1794
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:56,960
and back to your earlier
point Joy about Barack Obama,

1795
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:58,610
once he won the Iowa caucuses,

1796
01:10:58,610 --> 01:11:02,680
he was way behind Hillary
Clinton in the polls, way behind.

1797
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:05,000
When he beat her by
what, about eight points

1798
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,800
in the Iowa caucus in '08,

1799
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:08,130
suddenly he was electable.

1800
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:10,760
So I think, it is early,
I agree with everything

1801
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:13,690
everyone else has said, I
think we have to address

1802
01:11:13,690 --> 01:11:17,220
the fact that our fear
could be our worst enemy.

1803
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:18,850
In terms of getting the kind of leader

1804
01:11:18,850 --> 01:11:20,170
we need for the country.

1805
01:11:20,170 --> 01:11:22,900
- Can I tap into that and just say Joy,

1806
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:24,933
just really quickly to Maya's point.

1807
01:11:24,933 --> 01:11:26,190
I think she's right, that some people

1808
01:11:26,190 --> 01:11:28,290
voted for Donald Trump
despite these things

1809
01:11:28,290 --> 01:11:29,530
but we also have to reconcile

1810
01:11:29,530 --> 01:11:30,650
with the fact that a lot of people

1811
01:11:30,650 --> 01:11:32,830
voted for this president
because of these things

1812
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:35,190
and we still see a lot of ugly rhetoric

1813
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:37,830
coming out of the right
and we have to remember,

1814
01:11:37,830 --> 01:11:40,070
these guys are not running
against Donald Trump right now.

1815
01:11:40,070 --> 01:11:41,370
They're running against each other

1816
01:11:41,370 --> 01:11:42,800
and so we have to get through a primary.

1817
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,560
So I take Dean's point, that yeah,

1818
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:47,480
obviously Kamala Harris is electable

1819
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:49,570
and it is something that
voters should pay attention to.

1820
01:11:49,570 --> 01:11:51,810
She handled Joe Biden on that stage

1821
01:11:51,810 --> 01:11:53,380
and whether you're a
supporter of hers or not,

1822
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:56,200
I think there is this underbelly of people

1823
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:58,190
who are just really dying to see her

1824
01:11:58,190 --> 01:12:00,150
body Donald Trump on a debate stage

1825
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:02,290
and dying to see her slap him
around on the debate stage

1826
01:12:02,290 --> 01:12:04,660
which she could probably handle very well,

1827
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:06,520
probably better than some
of the other candidates.

1828
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:08,130
But, who's doing the asking?

1829
01:12:08,130 --> 01:12:09,810
Who's saying, is a woman electable?

1830
01:12:09,810 --> 01:12:11,590
Who's saying is a black woman electable?

1831
01:12:11,590 --> 01:12:12,600
And when you look at the people

1832
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:14,830
who are questioning that
they frequently don't look

1833
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:16,440
like some of us on the panel.

1834
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:17,960
So I think, and sometimes they do.

1835
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:19,460
Sometimes there are people
out of South Carolina

1836
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:22,103
who really do think that
black people can be,

1837
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:24,928
we can question ourselves in a way

1838
01:12:24,928 --> 01:12:28,850
that sometimes not even
white people question.

1839
01:12:28,850 --> 01:12:31,490
- Yeah, I mean to Tiffany's--
- And to add to that point,

1840
01:12:31,490 --> 01:12:33,050
go on, go on, go on!

1841
01:12:33,050 --> 01:12:34,330
- Yeah I mean to Tiffany's point

1842
01:12:34,330 --> 01:12:36,460
which I think is excellent,

1843
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:39,810
that's why this has to be
about expanding the base.

1844
01:12:39,810 --> 01:12:41,350
Expanding the electorate.

1845
01:12:41,350 --> 01:12:44,720
Not about how many Trump
voters can be peeled off.

1846
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:49,170
But where are the '08
and 2012 Obama voters?

1847
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:51,490
And that means this conversation

1848
01:12:51,490 --> 01:12:53,900
that oftentimes the
political class talks about

1849
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:56,450
with low-propensity voters
but we like to talk about

1850
01:12:56,450 --> 01:12:57,890
as high-potential voters.

1851
01:12:57,890 --> 01:12:59,567
The black folks and the people of color

1852
01:12:59,567 --> 01:13:01,470
and young people who oftentimes

1853
01:13:01,470 --> 01:13:02,650
never get talked to.

1854
01:13:02,650 --> 01:13:05,530
Who is gonna inspire
those voters to turn out?

1855
01:13:05,530 --> 01:13:09,560
Because if actually we can
expand the base of voters

1856
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:11,830
and turn out people that have otherwise

1857
01:13:11,830 --> 01:13:13,380
not turned out in the last election

1858
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:15,850
and don't turn out
oftentimes in elections,

1859
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:19,510
we not only win elections, but
we win with the type of base

1860
01:13:19,510 --> 01:13:22,230
that allows us govern in progressive ways.

1861
01:13:22,230 --> 01:13:24,450
To pass the type of legislation

1862
01:13:24,450 --> 01:13:27,600
and the type of policy and practice change

1863
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,860
that these candidates are
actually talking about.

1864
01:13:29,860 --> 01:13:33,110
And so to the point of
both the conversation

1865
01:13:33,110 --> 01:13:35,480
about who's having this
conversation in the media

1866
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:37,070
and how the media is covering this

1867
01:13:37,070 --> 01:13:39,860
but also who these
candidates are talking to.

1868
01:13:39,860 --> 01:13:43,180
This has to be a story
about not just appealing

1869
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:44,930
to the lowest common denominator

1870
01:13:44,930 --> 01:13:46,620
but appealing to the aspirations

1871
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:48,650
and expanding the base of voters

1872
01:13:48,650 --> 01:13:51,850
and that's why new voices
and voices that are unafraid,

1873
01:13:51,850 --> 01:13:54,560
women people of color
are gonna be so important

1874
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:57,223
to usher in the Democratic
Party into the next phase.

1875
01:13:58,090 --> 01:13:59,710
- Yeah absolutely, Democratic
Party has to decide

1876
01:13:59,710 --> 01:14:01,640
that they have to sort of,

1877
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:05,240
do a sort of kind of a
nostalgia version of themselves

1878
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:07,030
in order to mollify a
certain kind of voter

1879
01:14:07,030 --> 01:14:08,400
or do they go forward, I don't know.

1880
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:10,610
The women seem to be
leading that conversation

1881
01:14:10,610 --> 01:14:12,850
at the moment, Maya
Wiley, Rashad Robinson,

1882
01:14:12,850 --> 01:14:13,740
thank you very much.

1883
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:15,810
Tiffany and Dean, we'll be right back.

1884
01:14:15,810 --> 01:14:17,910
And coming up, we're gonna talk Biden

1885
01:14:17,910 --> 01:14:20,250
and whether this past week was a glitch

1886

ripped into the side of
the Titanic, that's next.

Especially at Daytona.

1948
01:17:35,210 --> 01:17:38,873
Just starting the car is
an uprising, a revolution.

1949
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:42,670
It's a time machine to
the front tier days,

1950
01:17:42,670 --> 01:17:43,957
good times and a day out for fun

for free Americans
anywhere and everywhere.

1952
01:17:47,910 --> 01:17:50,090
And to celebrate our nation's birthday,

1953
01:17:50,090 --> 01:17:51,283
we'll do it at Daytona.

1954
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:56,563
And a 200 mile an hour
glory of red white and blue.

1955
01:17:58,653 --> 01:18:00,440
(dramatic music)

1956
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:01,600
- I was prepared for them to come after me

1957
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:04,500
but I wasn't prepared for
the person coming at me

1958
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:07,303
the way she came at, she
knew Beau, she knows me.

1959
01:18:09,370 --> 01:18:11,250
- It was the most dramatic breakout moment

1960
01:18:11,250 --> 01:18:12,540
of the first Democratic debate.

1961
01:18:12,540 --> 01:18:14,730
Senator Kamala Harris,
the only black candidate

1962
01:18:14,730 --> 01:18:16,520
on the Democratic debate stage,

1963
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:18,620
confronting former vice
president Joe Biden

1964
01:18:18,620 --> 01:18:21,500
for boasting about working
with notoriously racist

1965
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:24,080
segregationist senators in past decades

1966
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:25,910
and for his stance on busing,

1967
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:28,410
as a means of integrating
the public school system.

1968
01:18:28,410 --> 01:18:29,727
On Friday, Biden did an interview on CNN

1969
01:18:29,727 --> 01:18:31,993
trying to clean up on aisle six.

1970
01:18:33,190 --> 01:18:34,260
- I think if you take a look,

1971
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:37,410
our positions aren't any
different as we're finding out.

1972
01:18:37,410 --> 01:18:39,350
- You were not in favor of busing.

1973
01:18:39,350 --> 01:18:41,240
It was a different time, there
were different applications.

1974
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:42,801
Why not just own it and say--

1975
01:18:42,801 --> 01:18:43,660
- Oh by the way, here's the thing--

1976
01:18:43,660 --> 01:18:45,670
- I was against it, but now I've changed.

1977
01:18:45,670 --> 01:18:49,380
- I was in favor of busing
that was de jure busing.

1978
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:52,760
Look, the question is how
do you equalize education

1979
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:53,910
in every area?

1980
01:18:53,910 --> 01:18:57,060
And I put forward the most
aggressive plan to do that

1981
01:18:57,060 --> 01:18:59,110
and I've been pushing it for a long time.

1982
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:02,507
- Tiffany Cross and Dean
Obeidallah are back with me.

1983
01:19:02,507 --> 01:19:06,510
And now joining is Will Bunch
of the Philadelphia Inquirer

1984
01:19:06,510 --> 01:19:07,770
and Will I want to talk to you about this

1985
01:19:07,770 --> 01:19:11,480
because Biden is now being
compared to Jeb Bush.

1986
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:14,480
Gail Collins wrote a piece
in which she said that Biden,

1987
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:16,410
she worried that he would
prove to be the Jeb Bush

1988
01:19:16,410 --> 01:19:17,330
of the 2020 cycle.

1989
01:19:17,330 --> 01:19:19,270
On Thursday he seemed
uncertain, unprepared,

1990
01:19:19,270 --> 01:19:21,480
and I think this was a
bit cold, she said feeble,

1991
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:23,320
it undermines the core
promise of his candidacy

1992
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:25,220
which is that he's the
guy who can beat Trump.

1993
01:19:25,220 --> 01:19:26,900
Another performance like
this one and he's done

1994
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:28,390
but I think more importantly,

1995
01:19:28,390 --> 01:19:30,230
what you're seeing from Biden

1996
01:19:30,230 --> 01:19:31,810
is that he does seem to be a candidate

1997
01:19:31,810 --> 01:19:32,930
geared toward the past.

1998
01:19:32,930 --> 01:19:34,920
He's saying I'm gonna
bring the past you liked

1999
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:36,450
which is the Obama era.

2000
01:19:36,450 --> 01:19:38,290
He doesn't feel like a
candidate of the future.

2001
01:19:38,290 --> 01:19:40,240
Is that a problem for him in this race?

2002
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:43,480
- I think so, absolutely.

2003
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:45,280
I was at his announcement in Philadelphia

2004
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:48,890
and I thought people were
partying like it was 2015.

2005
01:19:48,890 --> 01:19:53,230
He wants to go back to the
near past, to the Obama years.

2006
01:19:53,230 --> 01:19:55,650
And I think after
everything that's happened

2007
01:19:55,650 --> 01:19:56,860
the last three or four years,

2008
01:19:56,860 --> 01:19:59,743
I think people are looking
for a new direction forward.

2009
01:20:01,347 --> 01:20:02,760
I have to say in that soundbite you played

2010
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:04,450
where he said he wasn't expecting

2011
01:20:04,450 --> 01:20:07,860
the Kamala Harris moment.

2012
01:20:07,860 --> 01:20:09,070
That's really surprising to me.

2013
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:11,374
He's really had 40
years to prepare for it.

2014
01:20:11,374 --> 01:20:14,520
He could tell a good
story about his evolution

2015
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:16,500
on Civil Rights up to the point

2016
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:18,200
where he became the vice president

2017
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:20,000
to the first black
president in this country

2018
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,290
and he really fumbled the answer

2019
01:20:22,290 --> 01:20:24,510
to where he was mumbling
something about states rights

2020
01:20:24,510 --> 01:20:26,620
which, it reminded me of the launch

2021
01:20:26,620 --> 01:20:29,293
of Ronald Reagan's 1980
campaign in Mississippi.

2022
01:20:30,140 --> 01:20:32,990
And I think the broader problem though is,

2023
01:20:32,990 --> 01:20:34,550
Joe Biden has been on the defensive

2024
01:20:34,550 --> 01:20:36,423
since the day he entered this race.

2025
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:38,990
And I think Democratic voters

2026
01:20:38,990 --> 01:20:41,530
are really looking for affirmative reasons

2027
01:20:41,530 --> 01:20:42,697
to support a candidate.

2028
01:20:42,697 --> 01:20:44,580
And I think that's why you
were seeing Elizabeth Warren

2029
01:20:44,580 --> 01:20:45,770
rise so much in the polls

2030
01:20:45,770 --> 01:20:48,910
because she's put out plan after plan

2031
01:20:48,910 --> 01:20:52,220
and become a hashtag,
I have a plan for that.

2032
01:20:52,220 --> 01:20:56,340
And Biden really hasn't countered that

2033
01:20:56,340 --> 01:20:59,810
with any plans or policies
that, I know he has some

2034
01:20:59,810 --> 01:21:02,710
but they haven't really
captured the public imagination.

2035
01:21:02,710 --> 01:21:05,700
And, last night there
was a new video of him

2036
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:08,210
that was making the rounds
where a voter in Iowa

2037
01:21:08,210 --> 01:21:10,470
confronted him about what he was gonna do

2038
01:21:10,470 --> 01:21:12,337
about Brett Kavanaugh
in the Supreme Court.

2039
01:21:12,337 --> 01:21:14,830
And he basically spent 90 seconds

2040
01:21:14,830 --> 01:21:17,310
telling her he didn't have
a plan for that either.

2041
01:21:17,310 --> 01:21:18,560
And that's a tough issue.

2042
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:19,700
A lot of the candidates don't have

2043
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:21,200
a good answer for that, I think.

2044
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:23,160
But I think, again and again,

2045
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:25,790
if you're going to see Joe Biden

2046
01:21:25,790 --> 01:21:27,730
either trying to defend his past record

2047
01:21:27,730 --> 01:21:30,800
or trying to justify his candidacy

2048
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:33,150
beyond just he thinks he
can beat Donald Trump,

2049
01:21:34,590 --> 01:21:36,580
you're gonna see him continue
to erode in the polls

2050
01:21:36,580 --> 01:21:39,433
if that's his style and
that's the way he campaigns.

2051
01:21:40,380 --> 01:21:42,831
- Yeah, I mean Tiffany there's
something about even that.

2052
01:21:42,831 --> 01:21:43,920
The thing that Will just mentioned,

2053
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:44,820
about him saying that,

2054
01:21:44,820 --> 01:21:46,510
he also said he'd
nominate Merrick Garland,

2055
01:21:46,510 --> 01:21:47,990
which is also going backwards

2056
01:21:47,990 --> 01:21:49,340
and saying I'm gonna go get that guy

2057
01:21:49,340 --> 01:21:50,750
who's like a sort of moderate,

2058
01:21:50,750 --> 01:21:52,280
that even when President
Obama nominated him,

2059
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:53,160
people sort of shrugged

2060
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:55,740
until Mitch McConnell said no to him.

2061
01:21:55,740 --> 01:21:58,060
Does Biden, and listen, the reality is,

2062
01:21:58,060 --> 01:21:59,310
Democrats love Joe Biden.

2063
01:21:59,310 --> 01:22:02,490
Let's just be honest,
Democrats love Uncle Joe,

2064
01:22:02,490 --> 01:22:03,870
but is that enough of a reason

2065
01:22:03,870 --> 01:22:05,120
to nominate him to be president?

2066
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:07,370
Does he need a forward looking strategy

2067
01:22:07,370 --> 01:22:10,270
that isn't just you
love me, I'm Uncle Joe.

2068
01:22:10,270 --> 01:22:12,640
- And if voters are concerned,

2069
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:15,250
we wanna vote for the person,
who can beat Donald Trump,

2070
01:22:15,250 --> 01:22:19,260
if Joe Biden was not prepared
for this moment on busing,

2071
01:22:19,260 --> 01:22:21,280
what will he not be prepared for

2072
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:23,290
when he's on the debate
stage with Donald Trump?

2073
01:22:23,290 --> 01:22:24,530
And this is a legitimate question

2074
01:22:24,530 --> 01:22:26,770
that people have to ask themselves.

2075
01:22:26,770 --> 01:22:30,190
And listen, it is not
enough in today's society

2076
01:22:30,190 --> 01:22:32,150
in a post-Trump America for you to say,

2077
01:22:32,150 --> 01:22:34,930
no, no, no but wait, my
best friend was black,

2078
01:22:34,930 --> 01:22:36,620
I served the first black president

2079
01:22:36,620 --> 01:22:39,700
and let me go through
this clumsy explanation

2080
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:42,150
on how I came to some of
these policy positions.

2081
01:22:42,150 --> 01:22:43,960
That is not going to resonate with voters

2082
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:45,880
particularly, we saw in the midterms

2083
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:47,500
this surge in younger voters

2084
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:51,680
who were younger people during
the Obama administration

2085
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:54,170
who are paying more attention

2086
01:22:54,170 --> 01:22:56,720
in this legislative environment now.

2087
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:58,490
Some people's political positions.

2088
01:22:58,490 --> 01:23:01,430
So, I think he has a lot of work to do

2089
01:23:01,430 --> 01:23:05,000
to resonate with voters and
you have to also look like,

2090
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,270
we know some of the people
who work on Joe Biden's staff.

2091
01:23:07,270 --> 01:23:10,135
It's like nobody, did you all
not have during debate prep

2092
01:23:10,135 --> 01:23:12,090
did you not think that
question would come up?

2093
01:23:12,090 --> 01:23:14,150
And why this topic is even being discussed

2094
01:23:14,150 --> 01:23:17,700
in the first place, is because
he started out by saying

2095
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:19,750
listen guys, I can work
with segregationists.

2096
01:23:19,750 --> 01:23:21,040
I can work with white supremacists

2097
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:22,520
because I've done it before.

2098
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:24,880
And I don't think a lot of
people are looking for you

2099
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:26,270
to work with these people.

2100
01:23:26,270 --> 01:23:27,130
People are looking for you

2101
01:23:27,130 --> 01:23:29,340
to get these people out root and stem

2102
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:32,380
and redefine what this
government should be

2103
01:23:32,380 --> 01:23:35,750
and could be for all people
including people of color

2104
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:39,300
who've been disenfranchised for decades.

2105
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:41,500
- Yeah, and let me play
you what Biden said.

2106
01:23:42,430 --> 01:23:43,470
Dean I wanna play this for you.

2107
01:23:43,470 --> 01:23:46,060
This is Joe Biden talking on CNN

2108
01:23:46,060 --> 01:23:47,790
when he did this
interview with Chris Cuomo

2109
01:23:47,790 --> 01:23:49,640
about that moment with Kamala Harris.

2110
01:23:50,990 --> 01:23:52,747
- I think it'd be great
to have a female VP.

2111
01:23:52,747 --> 01:23:55,665
And if I don't win it'd be great
to have a female president.

2112
01:23:55,665 --> 01:23:57,370
- Do you think a Democrat ticket can win

2113
01:23:57,370 --> 01:23:59,503
without a woman in one of the two slots?

2114
01:24:00,580 --> 01:24:02,190
- Yeah well, the answer is yes,

2115
01:24:02,190 --> 01:24:05,820
but I think it helps having
a woman on the ticket.

2116
01:24:05,820 --> 01:24:08,520
And there's a lot of really
qualified women out there.

2117
01:24:11,190 --> 01:24:12,523
- So that makes the point a little bit

2118
01:24:12,523 --> 01:24:14,060
because it does talk about him saying,

2119
01:24:14,060 --> 01:24:15,430
yeah, it'd be great to have a female VP.

2120
01:24:15,430 --> 01:24:17,467
Again saying maybe in the future,

2121
01:24:17,467 --> 01:24:19,040
it'd be great to have a
woman VP and eventually

2122
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:21,960
but here's now, this cut
one from my producers.

2123
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:23,480
This is him actually speaking about

2124
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:25,580
how he felt about being
confronted by Kamala Harris.

2125
01:24:25,580 --> 01:24:26,413
This is cut one.

2126
01:24:27,750 --> 01:24:32,750
- It was hurtful to hear you
talk about the reputations

2127
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:37,970
of two United States senators
who built their reputations

2128
01:24:37,970 --> 01:24:42,580
and career on the segregation
of race in this country.

2129
01:24:42,580 --> 01:24:46,550
And it was not only
that but you also worked

2130
01:24:46,550 --> 01:24:48,303
with them to oppose busing.

2131
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:52,191
- Sorry about that, okay
I didn't have the cut

2132
01:24:52,191 --> 01:24:53,024
that I was looking for.

2133
01:24:53,024 --> 01:24:53,857
The one I wanted to play for you,

2134
01:24:53,857 --> 01:24:55,700
and I'll just describe it to you Dean.

2135
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:57,560
Is that he says to Chris Cuomo,

2136
01:24:57,560 --> 01:25:01,440
that it was hurtful to him
to be confronted that way

2137
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:02,509
by Kamala Harris.

2138
01:25:02,509 --> 01:25:05,400
He said, "She knows my
son, she knows my family."

2139
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:07,940
Something about that, I
think as a person of color

2140
01:25:07,940 --> 01:25:10,900
maybe hearing it, it
feels like he feels like

2141
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:12,260
he's done so much.

2142
01:25:12,260 --> 01:25:14,510
I don't know, it felt as if he felt

2143
01:25:14,510 --> 01:25:16,680
that he shouldn't be questioned in a sense

2144
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:18,930
because he's been Barack Obama's VP,

2145
01:25:18,930 --> 01:25:21,210
that he shouldn't be questioned.

2146
01:25:21,210 --> 01:25:23,930
- Well on some level to me,
and that could be part of it,

2147
01:25:23,930 --> 01:25:26,670
it hearkens back to what
we were talking about.

2148
01:25:26,670 --> 01:25:28,670
Joe Biden is a throwback
to a different time

2149
01:25:28,670 --> 01:25:31,800
where you like someone in
politics, they won't attack you.

2150
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:32,633
They're my friend.

2151
01:25:32,633 --> 01:25:34,770
And to remind people, 2016,

2152
01:25:34,770 --> 01:25:36,640
in the California primary for Senate,

2153
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:40,700
President Obama and Joe
Biden supported Kamala Harris

2154
01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:42,740
in that primary and he campaigned for her.

2155
01:25:42,740 --> 01:25:43,970
And so he knows his son as well,

2156
01:25:43,970 --> 01:25:47,320
so he was stunned that
someone who is my friend

2157
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:49,317
on the stage, in front of
everyone would mock me.

2158
01:25:49,317 --> 01:25:52,350
And that goes back,
criticize me based on policy

2159
01:25:52,350 --> 01:25:53,183
and I think that goes back

2160
01:25:53,183 --> 01:25:55,180
to an older view of
politics frankly where,

2161
01:25:55,180 --> 01:25:56,060
hey we're all friends.

2162
01:25:56,060 --> 01:25:58,030
We're only slightly different
from each on policy.

2163
01:25:58,030 --> 01:25:59,170
We can all get along

2164
01:25:59,170 --> 01:26:02,470
and that's not gonna work
any more today in 2020.

2165
01:26:02,470 --> 01:26:03,900
I think Joe Biden time and time again

2166
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:06,000
reminds us of why in 2008,

2167
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,420
he got less than 1% of the vote in Iowa

2168
01:26:08,420 --> 01:26:09,810
before he dropped out of the race.

2169
01:26:09,810 --> 01:26:11,380
He was not a great candidate.

2170
01:26:11,380 --> 01:26:13,730
He may have been a great vice
president, I think he was.

2171
01:26:13,730 --> 01:26:15,570
He might know the policies inside and out.

2172
01:26:15,570 --> 01:26:17,490
As a candidate he's not proving himself

2173
01:26:17,490 --> 01:26:18,610
and we need someone truly

2174
01:26:18,610 --> 01:26:21,170
that's gonna inspire
people to go in the rain

2175
01:26:21,170 --> 01:26:23,160
and knock on doors, to drive
their friends to the polls,

2176
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:25,450
to make phone calls, to donate money.

2177
01:26:25,450 --> 01:26:27,540
And Joe Biden is gonna pick up his game

2178
01:26:27,540 --> 01:26:28,620
to be that person.

2179
01:26:28,620 --> 01:26:31,253
It's just not gonna work,
I was the vice president,

2180
01:26:32,428 --> 01:26:33,990
I'm inevitable, give me this position.

2181
01:26:33,990 --> 01:26:35,910
Not gonna happen in 2020,
I can assure you that

2182
01:26:35,910 --> 01:26:38,350
he still could be the nominee
but it's not inevitable.

2183
01:26:38,350 --> 01:26:41,230
That's changed the game
from the first debate.

2184
01:26:41,230 --> 01:26:43,530
- Will very quickly,
last word to you on this.

2185
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:47,600
Is Biden running too much
on saying essentially

2186
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:50,433
that he wants to be the president,

2187
01:26:51,590 --> 01:26:52,810
does he need to make a clear reason

2188
01:26:52,810 --> 01:26:53,710
why he wants to be a president

2189
01:26:53,710 --> 01:26:55,560
other than what he's done in the past?

2190
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:57,440
Because it does feel like his candidacy

2191
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:59,620
really is rooted in a
thing where he's like

2192
01:26:59,620 --> 01:27:01,360
I've done all this for you in the past,

2193
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:02,860
now it's time for me to be president.

2194
01:27:02,860 --> 01:27:05,330
'cause it doesn't sound
like a real strong,

2195
01:27:05,330 --> 01:27:06,180
I don't know, what do you think?

2196
01:27:06,180 --> 01:27:07,610
- Are you asking me Joy?
- Well people are--

2197
01:27:07,610 --> 01:27:09,632
- The reality, I'm sorry.
- People know,

2198
01:27:09,632 --> 01:27:10,730
yeah people know--

2199
01:27:10,730 --> 01:27:12,460
- [Joy] For will, for Will sorry.

2200
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:13,293
- Yeah that's okay.

2201
01:27:13,293 --> 01:27:15,570
If people wanna know
what he's going to do,

2202
01:27:15,570 --> 01:27:17,730
also in his announcement, he says

2203
01:27:17,730 --> 01:27:19,890
you wanna do something
about climate change,

2204
01:27:19,890 --> 01:27:21,650
beat Donald Trump, that's
how you do something

2205
01:27:21,650 --> 01:27:22,483
about climate change.

2206
01:27:22,483 --> 01:27:24,180
And on one level of course that's right,

2207
01:27:24,180 --> 01:27:26,140
but I think people wanna hear much more.

2208
01:27:26,140 --> 01:27:27,670
You have other candidates like Jay Inslee

2209
01:27:27,670 --> 01:27:29,570
with much more detailed plans

2210
01:27:29,570 --> 01:27:32,130
and when he talks about Merrick Garland,

2211
01:27:32,130 --> 01:27:34,760
Merrick Garland is a perfect reminder

2212
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:38,070
of why the congenial
approach from the 1970s,

2213
01:27:38,070 --> 01:27:39,360
that he wants to bring back,

2214
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:41,683
just isn't gonna work in the 21st century.

2215
01:27:42,830 --> 01:27:44,920
How could somebody who was
there for Merrick Garland

2216
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:47,320
and what Mitch McConnell did to him,

2217
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:50,242
think that he can get along
with Republicans anyway.

2218
01:27:50,242 --> 01:27:52,300
They had a policy of eight years

2219
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:54,870
of trying to not get anything for Obama,

2220
01:27:54,870 --> 01:27:57,500
to deny him a second term and then

2221
01:27:57,500 --> 01:27:59,070
to deny him a Supreme Court seat.

2222
01:27:59,070 --> 01:28:01,730
And why that would suddenly change

2223
01:28:01,730 --> 01:28:03,530
with the installation of
Joe Biden as president,

2224
01:28:03,530 --> 01:28:04,980
I just don't see that at all.

2225
01:28:05,940 --> 01:28:07,930
- Yeah, I'm not sure that you
can beat massive resistance

2226
01:28:07,930 --> 01:28:09,343
with committee, it's hard.

2227
01:28:09,343 --> 01:28:10,310
It's a hard argument to make.

2228
01:28:10,310 --> 01:28:12,340
Dean and Tiffany will be
back later in the show.

2229
01:28:12,340 --> 01:28:13,270
Will Bunch, welcome to this show,

2230

2231
01:28:15,230 --> 01:28:17,280
And coming up, after multiple indictments,

2232
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:20,930
over 10000 lies and bowing
to dictators across the globe

2233
01:28:20,930 --> 01:28:25,010
Donald Trump has seen exactly
one elected Republican

2234
01:28:25,010 --> 01:28:25,843
quit their party.

2235
01:28:25,843 --> 01:28:28,443

2239

2240

and effort and talent.

2241

Please consider volunteering
and feeling that feeling

2242
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:44,630
that you helped someone today.

2243

2261
01:29:36,950 --> 01:29:38,790

magic these things do,

They're in your house and
they're out for blood.

2366
01:33:39,410 --> 01:33:40,810
There's just nowhere to hide

2367
01:33:40,810 --> 01:33:43,570
from the the mosquitoes,
bugs and flies inside.

2368
01:33:43,570 --> 01:33:46,130
But now, you can fight
those monsters back,

2369
01:33:46,130 --> 01:33:48,070
with the Bell and Howell Monster Trapper.

2370
01:33:48,070 --> 01:33:49,900
It's the ultimate bug killer.

2371
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:53,360
No dangerous pesticides, no
high frequencies or sounds

2372
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:55,030
and no sticky flypaper.

2373
01:33:55,030 --> 01:33:57,520
The secret is Monster Trapper's UV light

2374
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:01,680
that attracts them so that
3500 RPM Vacuum can trap them.

2375
01:34:01,680 --> 01:34:03,550
Monster Trapper traps them in,

2376
01:34:03,550 --> 01:34:05,000
then you dump them out.

2377
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:08,100
And the best part is, Monster
Trapper is whisper quiet.

2378
01:34:08,100 --> 01:34:10,290
It's silent bug deadly.

2379
01:34:10,290 --> 01:34:12,540
Watch in just six hours Monster Trapper

2380
01:34:12,540 --> 01:34:15,580
catches hundreds of nasty bugs, amazing!

2381
01:34:15,580 --> 01:34:17,700
Monster Trapper traps mosquitoes,

2382
01:34:17,700 --> 01:34:20,610
flies, fleas, wasps and more.

2383
01:34:20,610 --> 01:34:22,380
There's nowhere bugs can hide,

2384
01:34:22,380 --> 01:34:25,240
because they're all trapped
inside the Monster Trapper.

2385
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:28,570
Just plug it in and let
the bug trapping begin.

2386
01:34:28,570 --> 01:34:30,170
Use it anywhere in your house,

2387
01:34:30,170 --> 01:34:32,550
from the garage, to the
kitchen, to your bedroom.

2388
01:34:32,550 --> 01:34:34,880
And because of the unique one-way design,

2389
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:37,810
bugs stay in the trap
until you throw them away.

2390
01:34:37,810 --> 01:34:40,530
Look, you wouldn't wear
insect repellent to bed.

2391
01:34:40,530 --> 01:34:42,330
So use Monster Trapper instead.

2392
01:34:42,330 --> 01:34:44,590
It's so quiet, you won't
even know it's there.

2393
01:34:44,590 --> 01:34:46,050
And it's not just for inside.

2394
01:34:46,050 --> 01:34:47,820
Use Monster Trapper by the grill

2395
01:34:47,820 --> 01:34:49,190
to keep pests off your food.

2396
01:34:49,190 --> 01:34:51,070
Keep a Monster Trapper in the RV

2397

to ensure you're camping bug-free.

2398
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:55,240
Or plug it in to trap all those

2399
01:34:55,240 --> 01:34:57,130
annoying mosquitoes and flies.

2400
01:34:57,130 --> 01:34:59,280
Look, just one visit from the exterminator

2401
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:01,190
can cost over $100.

2402
01:35:01,190 --> 01:35:03,460
When it comes to trapping all those pests,

2403
01:35:03,460 --> 01:35:05,290
Monster Trapper works best.

- Isn't this a situation of
hate the game not the player?

2422
01:35:52,780 --> 01:35:53,970
- This is a power play.

This is a strategic move from her, right?

2424

Its Tuesday in Washington.

2427
01:36:01,540 --> 01:36:03,790
- The wall is a sticking
point, not border security.

2428
01:36:03,790 --> 01:36:06,250
- Although the promise was
a wall paid for by Mexico.

- I cannot wait to keep
talking about 2020.

01:36:08,190 --> 01:36:09,970
I gotta tell you, I
think it's fascinating.

of other's people's information.

2433
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:15,160
Then your job, is to keep
that information safe.

2436
01:36:23,491 --> 01:36:25,780
- I was hoping to set
an example for people.

2437
01:36:25,780 --> 01:36:28,860
I've been involved in
party politics for a while

2438
01:36:28,860 --> 01:36:31,570
and I believe very strongly

2439
01:36:31,570 --> 01:36:34,220
that it's hurting our
country at this point.

2440
01:36:34,220 --> 01:36:37,940
And I think people need to
stand up for what's right.

2441
01:36:37,940 --> 01:36:39,640
Stand up for what they believe in.

2442
01:36:41,020 --> 01:36:42,730
Be independent of these party loyalties

2443
01:36:42,730 --> 01:36:43,830
that really divide is.

2444

- That is former and that is right, former

Republican Congressman Justin Amash

2446
01:36:49,120 --> 01:36:51,550
on why he decided to leave the party.

2447
01:36:51,550 --> 01:36:53,720
Choosing, you guessed it, the 4th of July

2448
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:55,190
to celebrate his independence.

2449
01:36:55,190 --> 01:36:57,760
Amash was the only sitting
Republican Member of Congress

2450
01:36:57,760 --> 01:36:59,560
to support impeaching Donald Trump.

2451
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:01,260
He explained his decision
to quit the party

2452
01:37:01,260 --> 01:37:03,950
entirely in a Washington Post op-ed.

2453
01:37:03,950 --> 01:37:06,380
Saying quote, true to
George Washington's fears,

2454
01:37:06,380 --> 01:37:08,310
Americans have allowed
government officials

2455
01:37:08,310 --> 01:37:10,980
under assertions of
expediency and party unity

2456
01:37:10,980 --> 01:37:12,600
to ignore the most basic tenets

2457
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:14,200
of our constitutional order.

2458
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:17,030
Separation of powers,
federalism and the rule of law.

2459
01:37:17,030 --> 01:37:18,620
The result has been the consolidation

2460
01:37:18,620 --> 01:37:21,560
of political power and
the near-disintegration

2461
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:24,050
of representative
democracy and back with me,

2462
01:37:24,050 --> 01:37:25,550
Daily Beast columnist Dean Obeidallah.

2463
01:37:25,550 --> 01:37:28,020
Also joining Noelle Nikpour,
Republican strategist

2464
01:37:28,020 --> 01:37:30,650
and Jason Johnson, the
Republican Jason Johnson,

2465
01:37:30,650 --> 01:37:31,840
not the journalist Jason Johnson

2466
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:33,950
who is the consultant
and former senior advisor

2467
01:37:33,950 --> 01:37:34,863
to Senator Ted Cruz, so people don't think

2468
01:37:34,863 --> 01:37:36,280
that we introduced the wrong person

2469
01:37:36,280 --> 01:37:37,290
'cause there are two of you guys.

2470
01:37:37,290 --> 01:37:38,581
All right, so let me go to you first Dean.

2471
01:37:38,581 --> 01:37:39,414
The reason I wanted to keep you here

2472
01:37:39,414 --> 01:37:40,600
is you actually know this guy.

2473
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:41,730
Tell us a little bit about him,

2474
01:37:41,730 --> 01:37:43,420
because he is an interesting character.

2475
01:37:43,420 --> 01:37:44,742
Interesting person.
- Well I met him once.

2476
01:37:44,742 --> 01:37:45,575
- I shouldn't say character,

2477
01:37:45,575 --> 01:37:46,408
interesting Guy.
- We have a lot

2478
01:37:46,408 --> 01:37:47,241
of mutual friends.

2479
01:37:47,241 --> 01:37:48,730
What I do admire a great deal that

2480
01:37:48,730 --> 01:37:50,720
it took the son of a Palestinian refugee

2481
01:37:50,720 --> 01:37:52,710
to be the first one to
stand for impeachment

2482
01:37:52,710 --> 01:37:55,150
and I said that as the son of
a Palestinian refugee myself,

2483
01:37:55,150 --> 01:37:57,400
and when I met him, I was the MC

2484
01:37:57,400 --> 01:37:59,720
out of an Arab-American event in DC

2485
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:01,270
where he was being honored years ago

2486
01:38:01,270 --> 01:38:02,700
and it wasn't partisan.

2487
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:04,180
But let's be clear about one thing.

2488
01:38:04,180 --> 01:38:06,470
Donald Trump called him
a disloyal Republican.

2489
01:38:06,470 --> 01:38:07,830
This is a guy, Justin,

2490
01:38:07,830 --> 01:38:10,740
who is a founder of the Freedom Caucus.

2491
01:38:10,740 --> 01:38:12,190
This is a guy who's got a higher rating

2492
01:38:12,190 --> 01:38:13,600
from the American Conservative Union,

2493
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:15,650
higher than Lindsey Graham.

2494
01:38:15,650 --> 01:38:17,440
But to Donald Trump it's not about loyalty

2495
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:19,750
to the Republican Party,
or conservative principles,

2496
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:22,680
it's loyalty to one
person, Donald J. Trump.

2497
01:38:22,680 --> 01:38:26,160
So, this congressman
refused to be loyal to him.

2498
01:38:26,160 --> 01:38:27,210
It's not loyalty to the party.

2499
01:38:27,210 --> 01:38:31,030
And Justin's put the constitution
above his party before

2500
01:38:31,030 --> 01:38:32,610
and now he's put his party to the side,

2501
01:38:32,610 --> 01:38:34,410
said I stand up for the
United States of America

2502
01:38:34,410 --> 01:38:36,010
and I'm against partisan politics

2503
01:38:36,010 --> 01:38:38,360
that's become toxic, so
I applaud for him that.

2504
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:42,218
- Very quickly, he's
Syrian and Palestinian.

2505
01:38:42,218 --> 01:38:43,810
One parent is Syrian--
- I'm only half Arab,

2506
01:38:43,810 --> 01:38:44,950
he's 100% Arab.

2507
01:38:44,950 --> 01:38:47,850
I'm a 1/2 Arab guy, he's a pure out there.

2508
01:38:47,850 --> 01:38:50,633
So I think it's probably
shocked a lot of Republicans.

2509
01:38:51,660 --> 01:38:52,700
- And you know Noelle Nikpour,

2510
01:38:52,700 --> 01:38:54,328
it used to be, back you know,

2511
01:38:54,328 --> 01:38:57,310
I'm old enough to
remember when a plurality

2512
01:38:57,310 --> 01:38:59,580
if not a majority of people
who are Arab-American

2513
01:38:59,580 --> 01:39:01,718
in particular were Republicans.

2514
01:39:01,718 --> 01:39:03,870
Were sort of geared toward
the Republican Party.

2515
01:39:03,870 --> 01:39:07,530
There's been a huge exit of the party

2516
01:39:07,530 --> 01:39:08,460
by people of that record.

2517
01:39:08,460 --> 01:39:09,740
And he's not for that reason,

2518
01:39:09,740 --> 01:39:11,340
his piece in the Washington Post

2519
01:39:11,340 --> 01:39:12,190
I thought was brilliant.

2520
01:39:12,190 --> 01:39:14,170
He really explained where we are

2521
01:39:14,170 --> 01:39:15,880
in terms of hyper partisanship

2522
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:19,080
just eroding our politics
and that's really on one side

2523
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:20,920
more than the other to be honest with you.

2524
01:39:20,920 --> 01:39:22,360
The Republican Party
said that Barack Obama

2525
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:24,080
essentially doesn't exist as president.

2526
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:25,720
We will make him not exist.

2527
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:26,610
The fact that he's left,

2528
01:39:26,610 --> 01:39:28,620
what does it mean and why
is he the only one Noelle?

2529
01:39:28,620 --> 01:39:30,570
- Well, you know in my opinion

2530
01:39:30,570 --> 01:39:31,920
I think it was a wrong move

2531
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:33,390
that he left the Republican Party

2532
01:39:33,390 --> 01:39:38,390
because although he doesn't
like President Donald Trump,

2533
01:39:39,020 --> 01:39:42,603
he does respect the platform
of the Republican Party.

2534
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:47,130
In my opinion, you
really can't make change

2535
01:39:47,130 --> 01:39:50,160
and you really can't make a
difference if you just quit.

2536
01:39:50,160 --> 01:39:52,310
You just quit the party
because you don't like

2537
01:39:52,310 --> 01:39:53,860
who's representing the party.

2538
01:39:53,860 --> 01:39:57,000
You've got an opportunity
while you're in the party

2539
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,470
to get other people to convince them

2540
01:39:59,470 --> 01:40:02,340
of making change with policy.

2541
01:40:02,340 --> 01:40:05,278
Really the way you make
change is in policy

2542
01:40:05,278 --> 01:40:06,840
not by quitting because I know

2543
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:08,380
he's not gonna go on the other side

2544
01:40:08,380 --> 01:40:09,940
and join the Democrat party.

2545
01:40:09,940 --> 01:40:12,660
So it just leaves him to be an Independent

2546
01:40:12,660 --> 01:40:15,320
and the likelihood of
him getting reelected

2547
01:40:15,320 --> 01:40:17,890
is probably not good.

2548
01:40:17,890 --> 01:40:21,900
So therefore, I wish
that he would have stayed

2549
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:24,140
and made his case and really fought

2550
01:40:24,140 --> 01:40:26,950
for what he believed
in and tried to change

2551
01:40:26,950 --> 01:40:31,803
the direction of the course
versus just quitting it.

2552
01:40:34,137 --> 01:40:34,980
- First of all, it's Democratic Party,

2553
01:40:34,980 --> 01:40:36,510
we have to do that, that
is one rule on the show.

2554
01:40:36,510 --> 01:40:38,700
We don't use sort of the fake
names the Democratic Party,

2555
01:40:38,700 --> 01:40:39,710
we're gonna go with Democratic Party.

2556
01:40:39,710 --> 01:40:40,710
I'm gonna go to you Jason,

2557
01:40:40,710 --> 01:40:42,080
because the thing that he is,

2558
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:43,983
okay let's say he loves the
tax cuts for the rich, okay.

2559
01:40:43,983 --> 01:40:45,820
That he likes the Republican thing.

2560
01:40:45,820 --> 01:40:47,350
I don't know he could
like the kids in cages

2561
01:40:47,350 --> 01:40:49,000
but maybe let's say he likes that too.

2562
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,940
What he specifically has a problem with

2563
01:40:50,940 --> 01:40:52,260
is breaking the law.

2564
01:40:52,260 --> 01:40:53,883
This guy has been very clear.

2565
01:40:54,936 --> 01:40:55,770
He actually read the Mueller report.

2566
01:40:55,770 --> 01:40:57,248
He's one of the few in Congress

2567
01:40:57,248 --> 01:40:58,081
that's actually read it.

2568
01:40:58,081 --> 01:41:01,800
He read it and said oh,
this guy violated 10 times,

2569
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:05,060
the law that if he was a
civilian he'd be in prison

2570
01:41:05,060 --> 01:41:06,610
for obstructing justice.

2571
01:41:06,610 --> 01:41:09,670
If you can't be for the
president of the United States,

2572
01:41:09,670 --> 01:41:11,080
having to actually uphold the law

2573
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:13,830
he swears to uphold I'm not
sure what your purpose is

2574
01:41:13,830 --> 01:41:14,663
as a politician.

2575
01:41:14,663 --> 01:41:17,210
So doesn't he get credit
for actually believing

2576
01:41:17,210 --> 01:41:18,520
enough in the rule of law to say

2577
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:20,770
this guy violated, I'm outta here.

2578
01:41:20,770 --> 01:41:22,140
- So Joy, two things.

2579
01:41:22,140 --> 01:41:23,940
Number one I'm not going to sit here

2580
01:41:23,940 --> 01:41:27,300
and try to argue that Justin Amash's exit

2581
01:41:27,300 --> 01:41:28,550
from the Republican Party

2582
01:41:28,550 --> 01:41:30,360
and declaring himself an Independent

2583
01:41:30,360 --> 01:41:32,780
is detached and has nothing to do

2584
01:41:32,780 --> 01:41:34,970
with his calling for
impeachment of the president.

2585
01:41:34,970 --> 01:41:37,320
Clearly there's a direct correlation.

2586
01:41:37,320 --> 01:41:40,410
At the same time, I
think it's very important

2587
01:41:40,410 --> 01:41:42,550
and I know it's tempting
to only get wrapped up

2588
01:41:42,550 --> 01:41:44,240
in the Donald Trump portion.

2589
01:41:44,240 --> 01:41:46,330
If you read that editorial,

2590
01:41:46,330 --> 01:41:48,200
I too thought it was brilliant.

2591
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:51,380
I agreed with almost every
word within that editorial

2592
01:41:51,380 --> 01:41:55,310
because the reality is long
before Donald Trump came along,

2593
01:41:55,310 --> 01:41:57,340
this hyper partisanship, I mean,

2594
01:41:57,340 --> 01:42:00,530
think about what was just
said a moment ago by Noelle.

2595
01:42:00,530 --> 01:42:04,380
Why should Justin Amash, a member today

2596
01:42:04,380 --> 01:42:07,450
elected by his district of
the House of Representatives

2597
01:42:07,450 --> 01:42:10,420
be any less effective in arguing

2598
01:42:10,420 --> 01:42:13,350
for his brand of
constitutional conservatism

2599
01:42:13,350 --> 01:42:16,120
simply because he doesn't
have an R next to his name?

2600
01:42:16,120 --> 01:42:19,050
Now I'm not saying that he
won't be less effective,

2601
01:42:19,050 --> 01:42:20,900
in fact he will, but that in of itself,

2602
01:42:20,900 --> 01:42:24,320
sort of makes the point with
the problem that we have today.

2603
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:27,870
You either are on team red or team blue

2604
01:42:27,870 --> 01:42:31,370
and I think we all know that unfortunately

2605
01:42:31,370 --> 01:42:35,500
we listen or we're open-minded
to the arguments presented

2606
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:38,220
based upon the color of
the other person's jersey

2607
01:42:38,220 --> 01:42:41,270
and that's unfortunate,
it shouldn't be that way.

2608
01:42:41,270 --> 01:42:43,130
- Yeah, and then to that
point Noelle, answer that.

2609
01:42:43,130 --> 01:42:44,730
Because it's true, if you're saying

2610
01:42:44,730 --> 01:42:48,210
he still believes in the
principles of conservatism

2611
01:42:48,210 --> 01:42:50,690
then you mean if he takes off team red,

2612
01:42:50,690 --> 01:42:53,030
suddenly he is not a person

2613
01:42:53,030 --> 01:42:54,510
who should legitimately be reelected.

2614
01:42:54,510 --> 01:42:56,370
If people agree with what he's for

2615
01:42:56,370 --> 01:42:58,760
why shouldn't he get
reelected as an Independent?

2616
01:42:58,760 --> 01:43:02,830
- Well I mean, I feel like
that we have turned politics

2617
01:43:02,830 --> 01:43:04,093
into a bloodsport.

2618
01:43:05,332 --> 01:43:06,610
- [Joy] But aren't you doing that,

2619
01:43:06,610 --> 01:43:08,780
by saying that if he
takes off the red jersey,

2620
01:43:08,780 --> 01:43:11,140
suddenly he can't get
reelected, why shouldn't he?

2621
01:43:11,140 --> 01:43:13,990
- Because it's going to
be hard to raise money.

2622
01:43:13,990 --> 01:43:17,670
That's number one and if
you have turned your back

2623
01:43:17,670 --> 01:43:20,450
on the GOP, he said he
was quitting the GOP,

2624
01:43:20,450 --> 01:43:22,943
he didn't say he was
quitting Donald Trump.

2625
01:43:24,572 --> 01:43:26,600
He could've said maybe
I'm quitting team Trump.

2626
01:43:26,600 --> 01:43:28,673
I don't agree with that. He
said he's quitting the GOP!

2627
01:43:28,673 --> 01:43:29,506
- But how do you quit team Trump?

2628
01:43:29,506 --> 01:43:30,530
Wait hold on, hold on one second.

2629
01:43:30,530 --> 01:43:33,660
Wait a second, Donald Trump is the GOP.

2630
01:43:33,660 --> 01:43:36,690
Donald Trump is the head
of the Republican Party.

2631
01:43:36,690 --> 01:43:39,900
All of the policies, that Donald
Trump is putting in place,

2632
01:43:39,900 --> 01:43:42,250
your party 100% is standing behind him on.

2633
01:43:42,250 --> 01:43:43,780
Whether it's the children in cages,

2634
01:43:43,780 --> 01:43:45,280
which violates all kinds of laws

2635
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:47,410
and maybe the Geneva Convention.

2636
01:43:47,410 --> 01:43:49,400
They're behind him on tariffs,

2637
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:51,910
which are destroying
people's farms and ranches.

2638
01:43:51,910 --> 01:43:53,600
Destroying their lives.

2639
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:55,130
They're behind him on everything he does,

2640
01:43:55,130 --> 01:43:57,730
even if he's saying I'm going
to ignore the Supreme Court.

2641
01:43:57,730 --> 01:44:01,500
If no one has quit over that,
Charlottesville, nothing else,

2642
01:44:01,500 --> 01:44:03,670
does the guy get credit for
saying he has some principle.

2643
01:44:03,670 --> 01:44:04,940
At some point he says enough.

2644
01:44:04,940 --> 01:44:07,460
- He totally gets credit
for being his own man

2645
01:44:07,460 --> 01:44:09,670
and standing up for things

2646
01:44:09,670 --> 01:44:12,960
that he doesn't believe in or agree with,

2647
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:14,313
but to quit the party.

2648
01:44:16,296 --> 01:44:19,620
The Republican Party
platform is not Donald Trump.

2649
01:44:19,620 --> 01:44:21,433
It's a platform--
- But it is!

2650
01:44:21,433 --> 01:44:22,660
But it is, no yes it is.

2651
01:44:22,660 --> 01:44:23,910
It is Donald Trump, it is.

2652
01:44:23,910 --> 01:44:24,940
It's 100% Donald Trump.

2653
01:44:24,940 --> 01:44:26,100
It's whatever he wants he does it.

2654
01:44:26,100 --> 01:44:28,490
Whatever Donald Trump
wants that's the platform.

2655
01:44:28,490 --> 01:44:30,460
- But he ran under the GOP label.

2656
01:44:30,460 --> 01:44:34,190
But the GOP didn't run on
his label or his brand.

2657
01:44:34,190 --> 01:44:35,130
So in effect--

2658
01:44:35,130 --> 01:44:38,263
- So then the kids in cages
are the Republican platform?

2659
01:44:39,810 --> 01:44:42,720
- Well, I just feel like,

2660
01:44:42,720 --> 01:44:45,090
back to the original
point, I just feel like

2661
01:44:45,090 --> 01:44:48,070
for him to try to do
a reelection campaign,

2662
01:44:48,070 --> 01:44:52,100
raising money, trying to
depend on major GOP donors

2663
01:44:52,100 --> 01:44:53,800
to help get his message out,

2664
01:44:53,800 --> 01:44:55,360
I think that it's gonna be really hard.

2665
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:57,930
I just don't see him getting reelected

2666
01:44:57,930 --> 01:45:00,690
when he quits the
Republican Party, trying to,

2667
01:45:00,690 --> 01:45:02,060
what are you gonna run,

2668
01:45:02,060 --> 01:45:04,330
I guess you're gonna run as an Independent

2669
01:45:04,330 --> 01:45:07,910
and where are you gonna get
the funding sources for that?

2670
01:45:07,910 --> 01:45:10,840
There's not a lot of--
- It's all about money.

2671
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:11,980
Let me give Jason the last word.

2672
01:45:11,980 --> 01:45:14,211
Jason will there be
more, will there be other

2673
01:45:14,211 --> 01:45:15,663
Justin Amash's in your view.

2674
01:45:16,530 --> 01:45:18,840
- Well I would assume go forward.

2675
01:45:18,840 --> 01:45:21,330
Again, because this started
long before Donald Trump.

2676
01:45:21,330 --> 01:45:23,550
We will see more members.

2677
01:45:23,550 --> 01:45:27,050
It's amazing, out of 435
elected representatives

2678
01:45:27,050 --> 01:45:30,930
in the people's house there
now is only one Independent.

2679
01:45:30,930 --> 01:45:34,380
We hear all the time, about
how at least 1/3 of the country

2680
01:45:34,380 --> 01:45:38,900
is in fact Independent,
yet there's one out of 435.

2681
01:45:38,900 --> 01:45:41,670
Go forward and this
surprised both parties.

2682
01:45:41,670 --> 01:45:44,780
Unless the political
parties which are coalitions

2683
01:45:44,780 --> 01:45:48,290
of policy demanders, start to respond

2684
01:45:48,290 --> 01:45:51,440
to their bases and then
work with one another,

2685
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:54,480
beyond just the brand
on the actual issues,

2686
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:56,640
I do believe we will see more individuals

2687
01:45:56,640 --> 01:45:59,090
declaring their Independent
candidacy go forward.

2688
01:46:00,210 --> 01:46:01,540
- Last word to you Dean Obeidallah.

2689
01:46:01,540 --> 01:46:03,930
If he ran as an Independent,
would Democrats support him?

2690
01:46:03,930 --> 01:46:05,231
- They might 'cause they
came out to his town hall--

2691
01:46:05,231 --> 01:46:06,530
- Despite his policy differences?

2692
01:46:06,530 --> 01:46:08,000
- He got a standing ovation.

2693
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,250
But let's be, it's about,

2694
01:46:09,250 --> 01:46:11,600
the GOP is about loyalty
to Donald Trump only.

2695
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:12,830
It stands for nothing.

2696
01:46:12,830 --> 01:46:15,080
The GOP is Trump and Trump is the GOP.

2697
01:46:15,080 --> 01:46:17,430
It's a party, not team
red, it's team Trump.

2698
01:46:17,430 --> 01:46:20,240
And not one Republican stood up for Justin

2699
01:46:20,240 --> 01:46:21,780
when Trump said he's disloyal.

2700
01:46:21,780 --> 01:46:23,360
He's not disloyal to Republican values,

2701
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:24,861
he's disloyal to Donald Trump.

2702
01:46:24,861 --> 01:46:27,403
And that dictator-in-chief
demanded he be gone.

2703
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:30,233
- I recommend everybody read,

2704
01:46:30,233 --> 01:46:31,290
not Jason Johnson actually,

2705
01:46:31,290 --> 01:46:33,140
read Justin Amash's piece
in the Washington Post,

2706
01:46:33,140 --> 01:46:33,973
it's quite good.

2707
01:46:33,973 --> 01:46:36,130
Dean Obeidallah, Noelle
Nikpour, Jason Johnson,

2708
01:46:36,130 --> 01:46:37,160
thank you all very much.

2709
01:46:37,160 --> 01:46:39,910
Coming up, the freak out, the freak out

2710
01:46:39,910 --> 01:46:42,440
over a teenage mermaid
and what it tells us

2711
01:46:42,440 --> 01:46:45,347
about America's culture war, is next.

2712

But I'm Command Central.

- [Announcer] Why Elaine chose Verizon.

2743
01:48:22,990 --> 01:48:25,010
- It's so important to us that Verizon

2744
01:48:25,010 --> 01:48:26,723
is supporting military families.

2745
01:48:26,723 --> 01:48:27,930
When I have a child deployed,

2746
01:48:27,930 --> 01:48:30,110
having a reliable
network means everything.

2747
01:48:30,110 --> 01:48:31,430
So when I get a video chat

2748
01:48:31,430 --> 01:48:32,790
and I get to see their face,

2749

it's the best thing in the world.

2750

cardiologist recommended form of CoQ10.

Qunol, the better CoQ10.

2764
01:49:02,730 --> 01:49:05,610
- 10 years ago, I had an
undiagnosed heart condition

2765
01:49:05,610 --> 01:49:08,033
and erectile dysfunction
was actually the first sign

2766
01:49:08,033 --> 01:49:09,290
that something was wrong.

2767
01:49:09,290 --> 01:49:10,780
- Luckily I'm a doctor.

2768
01:49:10,780 --> 01:49:13,740
An expert in sexual
health, and Zach's dad.

2769
01:49:13,740 --> 01:49:15,730
- Not everyone has a doctor in the house

2770
01:49:15,730 --> 01:49:17,090
and some health conditions

2771
01:49:17,090 --> 01:49:18,560
can be really tough to talk about.

2772
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:20,510
We started Roman to change that.

2781
01:49:37,660 --> 01:49:40,070
- I've been on a diet for
as long as I can remember.

2782
01:49:40,070 --> 01:49:43,930
- I even cut out bread
and pasta for a day.

2783
01:49:43,930 --> 01:49:46,070
- I decided something needed to change

2784

and then I tried Noom.

2785
01:49:47,620 --> 01:49:48,453
- Noom worked for me.

2786
01:49:48,453 --> 01:49:49,960
- It's an easy to stick to program

2787
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:51,370
that actually changed my habits.

2788
01:49:51,370 --> 01:49:53,970
They say it's based on a
cognitive behavioral approach.

2789
01:49:53,970 --> 01:49:55,040
I just say it works.

2790
01:49:55,040 --> 01:49:56,740
- It just clicked, it worked.

2791
01:49:56,740 --> 01:49:58,390
It worked with Noom.

when I started losing my hair.

2795
01:50:05,730 --> 01:50:09,090
But then I realized, I
could actually do something.

2796
01:50:09,090 --> 01:50:12,180
Now I use Keeps, the
easiest way to keep my hair

who is set to star in the live action

2812
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:09,700
Little Mermaid remake.

2813
01:51:09,700 --> 01:51:12,280
Well now, here's where you
may wanna have any kids

2814
01:51:12,280 --> 01:51:13,641
under 12 leave the room.

2815
01:51:13,641 --> 01:51:14,982
I'm gonna give you a
moment, take a moment,

2816
01:51:14,982 --> 01:51:16,060
take 'em out of the room.

2817
01:51:16,060 --> 01:51:18,833
Okay, so mermaids aren't real.

2818
01:51:19,890 --> 01:51:21,020
I know, they're not real.

2819
01:51:21,020 --> 01:51:23,850
So in theory, anyone could
play a mermaid, right?

2820
01:51:23,850 --> 01:51:24,840
Wrong!

2821
01:51:24,840 --> 01:51:26,340
The announcement of Ariel's casting

2822
01:51:26,340 --> 01:51:28,690
has caused a multi-day freak out

2823
01:51:28,690 --> 01:51:30,430
amongst some Disney fans who are upset

2824
01:51:30,430 --> 01:51:33,560
that the actress cast to
play Ariel is not white.

2825
01:51:33,560 --> 01:51:35,430
Back with me is Tiffany
Cross of The Beat DC

2826
01:51:35,430 --> 01:51:37,110
and joining me now,
entertainment journalist

2827
01:51:37,110 --> 01:51:38,610
Chris Witherspoon.

2828
01:51:38,610 --> 01:51:40,070
Okay Chris, I gotta go to you first.

2829
01:51:40,070 --> 01:51:42,340
Because like, this seemed
like a perfectly adorable

2830
01:51:42,340 --> 01:51:45,060
wonderful thing, she is
adorable, the young lady

2831
01:51:45,060 --> 01:51:47,590
who's going to play Ariel.

2832
01:51:47,590 --> 01:51:49,430
She tweets out dream come true,

2833
01:51:49,430 --> 01:51:51,220
animated picture of an
African-American there.

2834
01:51:51,220 --> 01:51:52,650
People are excited that you're gonna have

2835
01:51:52,650 --> 01:51:55,000
this cute little African-American
girl being Ariel,

2836
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:56,720
but the freak out was real.

2837
01:51:56,720 --> 01:51:58,140
Not my Ariel trended,

2838
01:51:58,140 --> 01:52:00,180
I think it trended for a couple of days

2839
01:52:00,180 --> 01:52:02,970
after this happened and
people were screaming

2840
01:52:02,970 --> 01:52:05,850
she's supposed to be white
with red hair, what the H.

2841
01:52:05,850 --> 01:52:07,140
What is going on?

2842
01:52:07,140 --> 01:52:09,170
- You know, I'm giving
you eye rolls right now

2843
01:52:09,170 --> 01:52:11,270
because I was shocked
by the freak out myself

2844
01:52:11,270 --> 01:52:12,670
and a lot of the folks
that were freaking out

2845
01:52:12,670 --> 01:52:15,640
were white adults who grew
up with Little Mermaid

2846
01:52:15,640 --> 01:52:17,350
that came on at like maybe nine.

2847
01:52:17,350 --> 01:52:19,880
They had this white
depiction of a princess

2848
01:52:19,880 --> 01:52:21,450
that we have seen for decades.

2849
01:52:21,450 --> 01:52:23,720
And I think that the
freak out is unwarranted.

2850
01:52:23,720 --> 01:52:26,810
The reality is that there have
been 11 Disney princesses.

2851
01:52:26,810 --> 01:52:29,440
Guess how many of them
have been black, just one.

2852
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:32,270
So 91% of the sort of depiction

2853
01:52:32,270 --> 01:52:34,270
and the narrative of what
it is to be a princess

2854
01:52:34,270 --> 01:52:35,610
has been through this white lens.

2855
01:52:35,610 --> 01:52:37,506
So it's past due.

2856
01:52:37,506 --> 01:52:39,590
And the last time that
we had a black princess

2857
01:52:39,590 --> 01:52:40,600
was 10 years ago.

2858
01:52:40,600 --> 01:52:42,960
So calm down, have several seats

2859
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:45,680
and let's embrace Halle
and all of her talent.

2860
01:52:45,680 --> 01:52:48,130
That clip just showcased, she is fierce.

2861
01:52:48,130 --> 01:52:50,663
And she deserves this role, hands down.

2862
01:52:52,150 --> 01:52:53,910
- It's interesting...

2863
01:52:53,910 --> 01:52:55,320
Let me just read one tweet

2864
01:52:55,320 --> 01:52:57,350
and thank you to my team
for putting this up there,

2865
01:52:57,350 --> 01:53:00,190
'cause I think this sort of
made the point very well.

2866
01:53:00,190 --> 01:53:01,570
This is a woman named Stephanie Renee.

2867
01:53:01,570 --> 01:53:03,420
Who says my children
were raised with Ariel.

2868
01:53:03,420 --> 01:53:05,460
She's an icon in the eyes of many children

2869
01:53:05,460 --> 01:53:06,710
and adults of today, okay.

2870
01:53:06,710 --> 01:53:08,400
To change her race is absurd.

2871
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:09,720
That would be like someone making a movie

2872
01:53:09,720 --> 01:53:12,270
about Oprah Winfrey
and hiring a white girl

2873
01:53:12,270 --> 01:53:13,660
to play Oprah, Oprah is an icon.

2874
01:53:13,660 --> 01:53:15,160
We wouldn't want to change her.

2875
01:53:15,160 --> 01:53:17,890
Okay, first of all Oprah
Winfrey is a real person

2876
01:53:17,890 --> 01:53:21,230
so if you made a movie about her,

2877
01:53:21,230 --> 01:53:24,310
you'd want her to look kinda like Oprah.

2878
01:53:24,310 --> 01:53:25,880
This isn't a documentary.

2879
01:53:25,880 --> 01:53:28,340
There is no such person as Ariel,

2880
01:53:28,340 --> 01:53:29,524
it's not a person--
- And there is no time--

2881
01:53:29,524 --> 01:53:30,800
- She's just a fictional character.

2882
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:32,740
- There is no time under the sea

2883
01:53:32,740 --> 01:53:35,730
where Sebastian says
Ariel and your whiteness

2884
01:53:35,730 --> 01:53:37,770
and your Caucasian
experience, it doesn't happen.

2885
01:53:37,770 --> 01:53:41,360
So we could easily recreate
and retell this story

2886
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:42,227
however we see fit.

2887
01:53:42,227 --> 01:53:44,460
And I think Disney is doing a great job

2888
01:53:44,460 --> 01:53:46,910
at being inclusive and
finding ways to tell

2889
01:53:46,910 --> 01:53:49,653
diverse narratives and
do colorblind casting.

2890
01:53:50,760 --> 01:53:52,350
- It's really interesting.

2891
01:53:52,350 --> 01:53:53,350
Tiffany, I'm gonna come to you on this

2892
01:53:53,350 --> 01:53:55,177
because when "Malcolm X" was made

2893
01:53:55,177 --> 01:53:56,570
and I thought the movie was brilliant

2894
01:53:56,570 --> 01:53:57,810
and this was the Spike Lee film,

2895
01:53:57,810 --> 01:54:00,560
I had a slight problem,
with just the casting

2896
01:54:00,560 --> 01:54:03,350
of Malcolm X, brilliant,
Denzel Washington is a genius,

2897
01:54:03,350 --> 01:54:05,730
he can play anything but he's darker skin

2898
01:54:05,730 --> 01:54:06,830
and having light skin

2899
01:54:06,830 --> 01:54:09,040
was like part of Malcolm X's character.

2900
01:54:09,040 --> 01:54:09,873
Like you know what I mean?

2901
01:54:09,873 --> 01:54:10,800
So if you look at something like that,

2902
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:12,730
you're saying okay maybe
the casting was odd

2903
01:54:12,730 --> 01:54:14,910
because his whole
personality had to partly do

2904
01:54:14,910 --> 01:54:16,050
with his complexion.

2905
01:54:16,050 --> 01:54:17,840
But this isn't a documentary.

2906
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:20,490
It's about a fictional pretend creature

2907
01:54:20,490 --> 01:54:21,980
that's actually a fish.

2908
01:54:21,980 --> 01:54:24,510
- And even to the crazy
lady who's tweeting out

2909
01:54:24,510 --> 01:54:27,600
the tweet you just read,
how many white people

2910
01:54:27,600 --> 01:54:29,670
have actually played real black people?

2911
01:54:29,670 --> 01:54:32,120
You have white actors play Michael Jackson

2912
01:54:32,120 --> 01:54:32,953
and other people.

2913
01:54:32,953 --> 01:54:35,360
How often do our stories get whitewashed

2914
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:38,050
in mainstream Hollywood,
so this is so ridiculous.

2915
01:54:38,050 --> 01:54:39,930
Honestly Joy, I have a theory.

2916
01:54:39,930 --> 01:54:43,280
I think that not my Ariel
thing trended briefly

2917
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:46,090
because of those fringe
internet section comments

2918
01:54:46,090 --> 01:54:48,550
crazy people who tweet
out this ridiculous things

2919
01:54:48,550 --> 01:54:50,840
but I think the overwhelming
majority of people

2920
01:54:50,840 --> 01:54:53,840
who made this trend, were
people who disagreed,

2921
01:54:53,840 --> 01:54:55,670
who were saying how
ridiculous you all sound

2922
01:54:55,670 --> 01:54:56,870
saying this is not my Ariel

2923
01:54:56,870 --> 01:54:59,290
and this goes back to
the Megyn Kelly comments

2924
01:54:59,290 --> 01:55:00,350
that Santa is white.

2925
01:55:00,350 --> 01:55:03,910
And we could even look
at the Disney princesses

2926
01:55:03,910 --> 01:55:05,880
and they all look the same

2927
01:55:05,880 --> 01:55:08,380
even among the white princesses,
they all look the same.

2928
01:55:08,380 --> 01:55:10,450
There's never been a disabled princess.

2929
01:55:10,450 --> 01:55:12,320
There's never been an overweight princess,

2930
01:55:12,320 --> 01:55:15,080
so there are so many
areas where we can grow

2931
01:55:15,080 --> 01:55:17,580
and learn in these
spaces and to your point,

2932
01:55:17,580 --> 01:55:20,320
it is a cartoon character you idiots,

2933
01:55:20,320 --> 01:55:21,820
like what are you upset about?

2934
01:55:21,820 --> 01:55:24,263
You sound so ridiculous.

2935
01:55:25,401 --> 01:55:27,960
- I never disagree with
anything that Tiffany says

2936
01:55:27,960 --> 01:55:29,730
but Santa is real, his name is Larry,

2937
01:55:29,730 --> 01:55:31,333
we've had him on the show twice.

2938
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:34,220
So I'm just saying, Santa's real.

2939
01:55:34,220 --> 01:55:35,867
Don't play with me with
Santa, 'cause I met him.

2940
01:55:35,867 --> 01:55:38,660
- Can I say about Halle Bailey,

2941
01:55:38,660 --> 01:55:40,540
this girl is so talented.

2942
01:55:40,540 --> 01:55:42,190
Her and her sister they write music,

2943
01:55:42,190 --> 01:55:46,020
the understand music, they're
part of the Beyonce family

2944
01:55:46,020 --> 01:55:47,850
which you know I'm the honorary president

2945
01:55:47,850 --> 01:55:49,479
of the Beyonce fan club--
- Come through, can I be

2946
01:55:49,479 --> 01:55:50,840
the vice president?
- So anything she touches is,

2947
01:55:50,840 --> 01:55:53,080
well Chris you're my honorary co-chair

2948
01:55:53,080 --> 01:55:55,430
of the Beyonce fan club.
- Thank you.

2949
01:55:55,430 --> 01:55:58,470
- She's so talented and
if there's one sad thing

2950
01:55:58,470 --> 01:55:59,460
to be taken away of this,

2951
01:55:59,460 --> 01:56:02,380
it's that her joy was taken away

2952
01:56:02,380 --> 01:56:04,940
because of these fringe, crazy people

2953
01:56:04,940 --> 01:56:05,855
tweeting these things.

2954
01:56:05,855 --> 01:56:06,688
- And I think that the finger pointing,

2955
01:56:06,688 --> 01:56:08,020
if there is any in this scenario

2956
01:56:08,020 --> 01:56:10,060
it should really go towards Hollywood

2957
01:56:10,060 --> 01:56:12,410
and the fact that over the past,

2958
01:56:12,410 --> 01:56:15,700
since 1937 and Disney films,
we've seen "Snow White"

2959
01:56:15,700 --> 01:56:17,230
and "Cinderella", "Sleeping Beauty"

2960
01:56:17,230 --> 01:56:18,740
and they've all kind of looked the same

2961
01:56:18,740 --> 01:56:19,573
as you said Tiffany.

2962
01:56:19,573 --> 01:56:21,340
So I think it's high time that Hollywood

2963
01:56:21,340 --> 01:56:23,240
begins to embrace and open doors

2964
01:56:23,240 --> 01:56:26,510
and allow creatives that
have these stories to tell,

2965
01:56:26,510 --> 01:56:28,000
they can create new stories.

2966
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:29,330
Maybe it's not gonna be Ariel,

2967
01:56:29,330 --> 01:56:31,270
maybe it's gonna be an
actual black princess

2968
01:56:31,270 --> 01:56:33,470
who lives in Harlem or Brooklyn.

2969
01:56:33,470 --> 01:56:34,870

and new stories, or more new stories.

2971
01:56:36,840 --> 01:56:39,420
- And by the way the
people sort of overall,

2972
01:56:39,420 --> 01:56:41,810
this comes to the overall trauma

2973
01:56:41,810 --> 01:56:43,881
that people are feeling about
the changes in the culture

2974
01:56:43,881 --> 01:56:45,830
and that the culture doesn't
look like them anymore

2975
01:56:45,830 --> 01:56:46,770
that they're not in the center.

2976
01:56:46,770 --> 01:56:48,758
This is all a bigger
picture, so we wanna talk

2977

- [Announcer] This is your wake up call.

2987
01:57:06,030 --> 01:57:09,010
If you have moderate to
severe rheumatoid arthritis,

2988
01:57:09,010 --> 01:57:11,340
month after month, the clock is ticking

2989
01:57:11,340 --> 01:57:13,320
on irreversible joint damage.

2990
01:57:13,320 --> 01:57:15,030
Ongoing pain and stiffness

2991
01:57:15,030 --> 01:57:17,100
are signs of joint erosion,

2992
01:57:17,100 --> 01:57:19,240
HUMIRA can help stop the clock.

2993
01:57:19,240 --> 01:57:22,240
Prescribed for 15 years,
HUMIRA targets and blocks

2994
01:57:22,240 --> 01:57:23,300
the source of inflammation

2995
01:57:23,300 --> 01:57:24,910
that contributes to joint pain,

2996
01:57:24,910 --> 01:57:27,160
and irreversible damage.

2997
01:57:27,160 --> 01:57:28,470
- [Announcer] HUMIRA
can lower your ability

2998
01:57:28,470 --> 01:57:29,940

3000
01:57:31,830 --> 01:57:33,660

and new or worsening heart failure.

3005
01:57:41,610 --> 01:57:43,180
Tell your doctor if you've been to areas

3006
01:57:43,180 --> 01:57:45,220
where certain fungal infections are common

3007
01:57:45,220 --> 01:57:47,410
and if you've had TB, Hepatitis B

3008
01:57:47,410 --> 01:57:50,800
or prone to infections or have
flu-like symptoms or sores.

Two hearts, one soul,
a kiss, a hug, a laugh.

It's passion, it's freedom, it's mystery,
