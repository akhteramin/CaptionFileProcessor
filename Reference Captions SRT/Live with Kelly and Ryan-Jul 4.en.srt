1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:02,882
(energetic music)

2
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:11,600
- [Narrator] Stay ahead of the storms

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,251
with the StormWatch7 app.

4
00:00:13,251 --> 00:00:16,221
(ominous music)

5
00:00:16,221 --> 00:00:18,350
- [Announcer] It's the Fourth of July.

6
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,840
And, Kelly and Ryan are having a party.

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,480
A pool party.

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,580
Today, here to splash
in the pretend water,

9
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,680
the guys from "Stranger Things."

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,120
And, you can't have a
celebration without music.

11
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,740
So, O.A.R is here,

12
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,767
as our holiday house band.

13
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:36,650
And, the co-hosts are tossing bags

14
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,400
with the American Cornhole Champions.

15
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,840
Plus, members of our studio audience

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,830
could win some holiday prizes

17
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,560
when they compete in our
Fourth of July Games.

18
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,961
All next, on Live.

19
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:53,961
(upbeat music)
(applause and cheering)

20
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,492
And now, here are your
All-American co-hosts,

21
00:01:00,492 --> 00:01:03,366
Kelly Ripa and Ryan Seacrest.

22
00:01:03,366 --> 00:01:07,678
(audience applauding and cheering)

23
00:01:07,678 --> 00:01:08,511
- Hey!

24
00:01:12,426 --> 00:01:13,926
Woo! Looking good!

25
00:01:15,461 --> 00:01:16,602
Hi!
- Hi.

26
00:01:16,602 --> 00:01:18,327
(upbeat dance music)

27
00:01:18,327 --> 00:01:22,577
(audience applauding and cheering)

28
00:01:23,537 --> 00:01:25,360
- Happy Fourth of July.

29
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,541
Good morning, everybody.

30
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:28,070
(audience applauding and cheering)

31
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:29,443
Welcome to our party!

32
00:01:29,443 --> 00:01:30,630
- Hey, guess what?

33
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:31,658
O.A.R is our

34
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:33,055
house band today, baby.
- Yeah, yeah.

35
00:01:33,055 --> 00:01:34,147
- They're going to be performing for us

36
00:01:34,147 --> 00:01:36,060
throughout the show, thank you.

37
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,300
- Kelly, please.

38
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,189
- Look at this.

39
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:40,219
(applause)

40
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:42,480
- Let's talk about the
Fourth of July, Kelly.

41
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,357
- Ryan, I was hoping
you would bring it up.

42
00:01:44,357 --> 00:01:45,760
(audience laughs)

43
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,040
- The most important part of the Fourth,

44
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,980
obviously, is not necessarily the history,

45
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,270
but posting photographs of your

46
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,540
celebration on this day, right?

47
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,707
- Correct.
- So many great opportunities.

48
00:01:55,707 --> 00:01:56,810
- Correct.

49
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:59,830
- Now--
- Sophia, you are so cute.

50
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:00,663
Sorry, go ahead.

51
00:02:00,663 --> 00:02:02,860
- These are the best
captions for Fourth of July,

52
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:03,693
for your pictures.

53
00:02:03,693 --> 00:02:05,210
So, you're welcome.

54
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,663
Put these to good use later.

55
00:02:07,918 --> 00:02:10,732
Drinkin', #DrinkinLikeLincoln.

56
00:02:10,732 --> 00:02:12,796
(audience laughs)
(cheering and applause)

57
00:02:12,796 --> 00:02:13,920
Now I'm not making these up.

58
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,410
These are actually online.

59
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,600
Um...

60
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,557
Red, White, and Brew.

61
00:02:18,557 --> 00:02:20,182
#RedWhiteAndBrew.

62
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:22,340
(applause and cheering)

63
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,845
The Star Spangled Hammered.

64
00:02:23,845 --> 00:02:26,457
(laughing)
(audience cheers)

65
00:02:26,457 --> 00:02:29,916
Sippin' On LiberTea.
- Yeah, I like that.

66
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:30,818
- Well, that's...

67
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:31,876
If you want.
(audience member laughing)

68
00:02:31,876 --> 00:02:32,709
- Mhm.

69
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:34,280
You know what?
- Tell me, Kel.

70
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,550
- It's funny,
- Is it?

71
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,440
We're talking about,

72
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,030
where can we keep this gigantic flamingo?

73
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,270
Because, we can all agree,

74
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,730
this is probably the greatest

75
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,681
pool float in the universe.

76
00:02:44,681 --> 00:02:46,871
- [Audience Member] Oh, yeah!
(applause and cheering)

77
00:02:46,871 --> 00:02:48,954
- I think so.
- Seaworthy.

78
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,040
This is like the yacht of sea,

79
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,940
of pool floats,

80
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,346
Would you not say?
- This is it.

81
00:02:55,346 --> 00:02:56,179
- This is what you

82
00:02:56,179 --> 00:02:57,670
(stammers) strive for.
- You guys are rock stars.

83
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:58,940
You have this all day long.

84
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,616
This is like, in your tub.

85
00:03:00,616 --> 00:03:02,730
(laughing)

86
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:06,250
But, would you like to see
the world's largest pool?

87
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,970
It's at a resort in Chile.

88
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,550
- [Ryan] Look at that, oh my God.

89
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,350
- [Kelly] It's the San Alfonso Del Mar.

90
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,230
World's largest man-made lagoon.

91
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,870
It's the exact same crystal-clear,

92
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,470
turquoise hue of the sea.

93
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,450
- Sea Water.
- So, they made the pool

94
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,940
look just like the sea,

95
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,860
and they filled it with sea water.

96
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,600
I mean, why not just go in the sea, right?

97
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,167
I mean, am I right?
- Well, listen,

98
00:03:26,167 --> 00:03:27,037
- [Kelly] Am I just...

99
00:03:27,037 --> 00:03:28,930
- But, listen--
- Am I just being a killjoy?

100
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,570
- [Ryan] A lot of people
are afraid of, I don't know.

101
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:31,640
What they have in the sea.

102
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,580
They could have jellyfish.

103
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,720
They could have other animals,

104
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,680
creatures...
- Well listen,

105
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,620
somebody goes over there,
- This is safe.

106
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,790
- Grabs something over there,

107
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:37,623
and pulls a prank,

108
00:03:37,623 --> 00:03:38,530
and throws it in the pool.

109
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,363
It's gonna live,

110
00:03:39,363 --> 00:03:40,419
because it's sea water.
- It's gonna live

111
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:41,900
'cause it's sea water.
- Right?

112
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,740
- Honey, I'll be right back.

113
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,051
I'm going to do some laps.

114
00:03:44,051 --> 00:03:45,040
- Yeah.
How long do you think

115
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,580
that would take, days?

116
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,413
- I guess.

117
00:03:47,413 --> 00:03:49,430
I mean, they've got sailboats in there.

118
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,660
But, we could definitely get

119
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,309
a whole flock of these flamingos.

120
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:53,540
- Yeah.
(audience laughs)

121
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,080
We could jet ski in there.

122
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,420
- Yeah.
- If that's legal.

123
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,780
- I see all kinds of things in there.

124
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,613
- Sometimes, by the way,

125
00:04:00,613 --> 00:04:01,450
you know, there are some people

126
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,520
who are afraid to swim in the ocean,

127
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,240
and so that's a good alternative.

128
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,720
On the Fourth of July,

129
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,553
we should tell you,

130
00:04:06,553 --> 00:04:07,830
I mean, you know this,

131
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,160
obviously from history.

132
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,850
United States observes a federal holiday,

133
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,890
in honor of the Declaration
of Independence.

134
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,700
Commemorates the adoption of the

135
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,533
Declaration of Independence,

136
00:04:15,533 --> 00:04:18,026
July 4th, 1776.

137
00:04:18,026 --> 00:04:19,340
(audience applause and cheering)

138
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,650
By delegates from the 13 colonies.

139
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,920
Now, now the important stuff.

140
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,810
If the Fourth of July falls on a Sunday,

141
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,290
we observe the holiday
on the following Monday.

142
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,000
If it falls on a Saturday,

143
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,386
we observe it on a Friday.

144
00:04:31,386 --> 00:04:32,950
- If it falls on a Thursday--
- If it falls on a Tuesday,

145
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,930
we take the whole rest

146
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:34,936
of the week off.
- Exactly.

147
00:04:34,936 --> 00:04:35,769
(audience laughs)

148
00:04:35,769 --> 00:04:36,786
If it falls in between...

149
00:04:36,786 --> 00:04:38,260
(audience applause)

150
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,979
- Hey, did you hear about this?

151
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:42,390
- No, but I'm about to.
(audience members laugh)

152
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,360
- Do you guys know, how many--

153
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,210
Let's see, I see a lot of
young people here today.

154
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:48,570
Millennials, and Gen Z'ers,

155
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,060
- Hey guys.
- Where are you?

156
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,489
Yes.
(audience cheers)

157
00:04:51,489 --> 00:04:53,150
Lots.
- My people.

158
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,160
- Your people are here.

159
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,210
- My people.
- Your people are

160
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,520
representing.
- That's right, I see you.

161
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,880
- So, the flamingo pose is the latest

162
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,510
Instagram friendly stance.

163
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,625
Do you know about the
flamingo pose, everybody?

164
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:04,500
- Oh.
(audience murmurs)

165
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,040
- Here's, I believe,
is that Kendall Jenner?

166
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,440
Yep, Kendall Jenner is...

167
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,360
Well, are they calling
it the flamingo pose

168
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,790
because she's wearing that dress?

169
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,770
Or, because her legs, the one leg?

170
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,750
- Well, the dress helps.
- Gelman, we are,

171
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,750
you know, we are in

172
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,633
our thong shorts,
- Yes.

173
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,359
- So, maybe you can do
the flamingo for us?

174
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:27,760
(audience hollering)

175
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,593
- Maybe.
- Somehow that

176
00:05:28,593 --> 00:05:29,628
looks different.

177
00:05:29,628 --> 00:05:31,797
That doesn't look like...
(audience laughs)

178
00:05:31,797 --> 00:05:33,890
- [Ryan] That was tree, from yoga.

179
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:34,760
- (laughs) Well that's all I--

180
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,870
- Yeah.
- You stand on one leg,

181
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,190
and you get bonus points,

182
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,410
if you can slightly cross your knees.

183
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:43,420
Which helps to create a
slimming effect for your legs.

184
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,081
- [Ryan] Let's see your bonus points.

185
00:05:45,081 --> 00:05:46,290
(audience laughs)

186
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,340
- Gelman, you've got--
- What about my knee?

187
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,173
- Well, I wouldn't want--
- Come on.

188
00:05:49,173 --> 00:05:50,120
What do you want from me?
- You're actually--

189
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,467
- He actually looks--
- Alright.

190
00:05:51,467 --> 00:05:54,497
The other thing that's
a trend this summer...

191
00:05:54,497 --> 00:05:57,380
(stammers) This is not good for your skin.

192
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,670
Can't highly recommend it.

193
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,190
But, they're saying sunburn tattoos.

194
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,440
You know when you fall asleep in the sun,

195
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,513
you leave your hand like this?

196
00:06:02,513 --> 00:06:03,429
- Yes.
- Anybody?

197
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:05,300
- Yeah.
- So, sunburn tattoos

198
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,040
are big for the Summer of 2019.

199
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,230
People are placing
stencils on exposed skin.

200
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,530
Soaking up the sun.

201
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:12,560
And then, they've got,

202
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,249
you know, the Batman logo,

203
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:15,828
or other different things

204
00:06:15,828 --> 00:06:17,550
- Oh, geeze.
- That look like a tattoo.

205
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,500
- [Kelly] Oh, that seems dangerous though.

206
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,950
- It's, well that's not--
I mean, and you know it's not,

207
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,080
here's the thing kids,

208
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,752
and I'm going to tell you this...

209
00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:25,703
(clears throat)

210
00:06:25,703 --> 00:06:28,370
Oh, gosh.
(audience laughs)

211
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,410
Here's what I'm going to tell you,

212
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:32,010
because nobody told us,

213
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,670
in my day, this.

214
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:34,910
Because, there was still like,

215
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,040
a lot of conflicting data

216
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,385
about sunscreen
- Mmm, mhm.

217
00:06:38,385 --> 00:06:40,603
- At least in our household.
- Right.

218
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:45,620
- It's not the sunburn that day, right?

219
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,530
It's what the sunburn turns into,

220
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,710
30 years from now.
- Ah.

221
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,900
- Right, moms?

222
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,900
Yeah.
- So put it on

223
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,730
early so--
- And, I know that it is

224
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:56,400
in your instinct, Sophia,

225
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,960
to tune out the moms.

226
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,793
Do you understand?

227
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,390
I get it.

228
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,850
We get it.

229
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,950
It's everybody's instinct

230
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,447
to tune out the moms,
- To tune out the moms.

231
00:07:05,447 --> 00:07:07,444
Right.
- But, we actually,

232
00:07:07,444 --> 00:07:11,560
(stammers) we actually,
when it comes to this thing,

233
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,673
know exactly what we're

234
00:07:12,673 --> 00:07:14,980
talking about.
- You carry wisdom with this.

235
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,170
- Yes, you don't need,

236
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,550
you don't need a Batman shaped melanoma,

237
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,148
30 years from now.
(laughing)

238
00:07:22,148 --> 00:07:24,630
(applause)
(audience hollering)

239
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:27,530
- One other quick public service
for the barbecuers today,

240
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,910
for July 4th.
- Yes?

241
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,040
- If you are someone that--

242
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,530
When I'm out, and I'm with other people,

243
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,340
usually they get the mosquito bites.

244
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,240
- Am I crowding you?

245
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,430
I just noticed you leaned away from me.

246
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,840
I feel like...

247
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,280
I feel like I just brushed my teeth.

248
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,900
So, I don't think it's a--
- No, no, no.

249
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,460
You smell like a lozenge.

250
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,293
- I do.

251
00:07:45,293 --> 00:07:47,483
Well, that's because I ate the lozenge.

252
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:49,960
- No, but you're not crowding me at all.

253
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,870
- Right.
- I just wanted to make

254
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,196
eye contact.
- Oh, okay.

255
00:07:52,196 --> 00:07:55,930
So, your vision is going?
- My vision's bad.

256
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,480
Kelly?
- Kay.

257
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,920
- Kelly?
- You're the first millennial

258
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,168
I've ever seen do that.

259
00:08:00,168 --> 00:08:01,001
(laughing)

260
00:08:01,001 --> 00:08:02,790
- Can I borrow my millennial
glasses to read this?

261
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,740
- Sure, go for it.
- Oh, look at this!

262
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,640
No, it's a public service.

263
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,920
So, usually I'm not the one
gets eaten by mosquitoes.

264
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,910
It's the person I'm with.

265
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:12,300
Which is a great going out benefit, but...

266
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,710
- Oh my gosh.
- If you're the one

267
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:16,140
that always gets the mosquito bites,

268
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:20,230
researches say, music by Skrillex

269
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,549
will prevent the
mosquitoes from biting you.

270
00:08:22,549 --> 00:08:24,640
(audience laughs)

271
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,420
Researchers examined the effects

272
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,390
of electronic music on mosquitoes,

273
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,873
and it made 'em less likely to bite.

274
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:33,630
- Yay Skrillex.
- So, Skrillex is

275
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,533
the soundtrack to your barbecue.

276
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,953
Today on the show,

277
00:08:37,953 --> 00:08:40,101
the cast of "Stranger
Things," they are here.

278
00:08:40,101 --> 00:08:41,335
(audience applauding and cheering)

279
00:08:41,335 --> 00:08:43,370
Gaten, Finn, Caleb, Noah,

280
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,910
they're all here, backstage.

281
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,650
A whole bunch of 'em.
(laughing)

282
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:51,450
- And, nothing says Fourth
of July like cornhole.

283
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:54,470
So, we're gonna play cornhole
with the top competitors

284
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,891
from the American Cornhole League.

285
00:08:56,891 --> 00:08:58,521
By the way...
(audience cheering)

286
00:08:58,521 --> 00:09:01,910
(audience applauding)

287
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:02,743
I was like,

288
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:03,680
I thought we called it,

289
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,770
on our show, live-hole.

290
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:06,603
And, they were like,

291
00:09:06,603 --> 00:09:09,990
no, it's only live-hole
when we throw the beanbags

292
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,432
into our mouths.
- Into your--

293
00:09:11,432 --> 00:09:12,299
Exactly.
- Yes.

294
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:14,997
- We've special game that we developed.

295
00:09:14,997 --> 00:09:16,357
- Unbelievable.
- This is the real game.

296
00:09:16,357 --> 00:09:17,453
- This is the real--
- This is the real--

297
00:09:17,453 --> 00:09:18,610
- This is the league?

298
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:19,620
- Cornhole.
- We have the

299
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,270
league champions, alright.

300
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,550
And, throughout today's show,

301
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,868
members of our studio
audience will play Live's

302
00:09:24,868 --> 00:09:26,410
Fourth of July games.

303
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:29,350
The first game is our
annual Fourth of July

304
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,910
trivia dancer-off.

305
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,950
The dancers dressed themselves up.

306
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,880
They're ready to try and
dance their way to victory.

307
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,859
So, let's dance.

308
00:09:36,859 --> 00:09:39,050
(audience applauding and cheering)

309
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:41,480
- First up, say hello to Mary Malloy.

310
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,322
From East Rockaway, New York.

311
00:09:43,322 --> 00:09:45,832
(upbeat music)
(applause and cheering)

312
00:09:45,832 --> 00:09:47,900
- There she is.

313
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,490
Our next contestant is Gary Callione,

314
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,780
from Cincinnati, Ohio, Gar!

315
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:57,745
(upbeat music)
(applause and cheering)

316
00:09:57,745 --> 00:09:58,578
What's up, my brother?
- Nice, Gary!

317
00:09:58,578 --> 00:10:02,030
Our third contestant is Carla Gomen,

318

from El Dorado Hills, California.

319

(upbeat music)
(applause and cheering)

320
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:11,832
Very nice.
- And, the last,

321
00:10:11,832 --> 00:10:12,665
but not least,

322
00:10:12,665 --> 00:10:13,680
let's bring out Meredith Miller,

323
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,393
from San Antonio, Texas.

324
00:10:15,393 --> 00:10:20,393
(upbeat music)
(applause and cheering)

325
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,500
- Alright, studio audience.

326
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,318
You have a job.
- Oh, yes.

327
00:10:25,318 --> 00:10:27,890
- You're going to vote
for your favorite dancer,

328
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,070
and after trivia,

329
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:32,507
we will announce who the
audience picked to win.

330
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:33,340
- [Man] Alright!

331
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,569
- Alright, yeah.
- Okay?

332
00:10:34,569 --> 00:10:36,074
(audience applauding and cheering)

333
00:10:36,074 --> 00:10:36,907
(Kelly mumbles)

334
00:10:36,907 --> 00:10:37,740
- These are cool.
- Thanks.

335
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,040
- I love those.
- They're not mine,

336
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,070
they're Jan's.
- Oh.

337
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,530
Well Jan, those are great.
- Thank you.

338
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:42,990
- All week long, we're playing a special

339
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,620
audience edition of "Stump The Hosts,"

340
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:47,840
Where an audience shares a
summer-themed truth or lie,

341
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,620
and we have to figure out which is verdad.

342
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,110
- If they stump us,

343
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,080
they get a Kelly and Ryan mug,

344
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,673
and a $1,200 kitchen appliance
package, from Cuisinart,

345
00:10:59,723 --> 00:11:01,328
which we can all agree,

346
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:02,480
is all of the kitchen appliances.

347
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,500
- It is everything.

348
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,670
So dancers, give it your all, right now.

349
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:08,738
It's time for "Stump the
Hosts," audience edition.

U-S-of-Yay, am I right?

372
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,430
- Yeah, that's right.
- Happy Independence Day!

373
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,370

375
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:03,141
Where is Holly Dance, from Ogden, Utah?

376
00:12:03,141 --> 00:12:04,477
- Holly Dance?
- Hi, Holly!

377
00:12:04,477 --> 00:12:05,685
(audience applauding and cheering)

378
00:12:05,685 --> 00:12:07,454
(Kelly giggles)

379
00:12:07,454 --> 00:12:08,550
Okay.
- Okay.

380
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:11,910
- Okay, you can stay
right there in the ocean.

381
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,940
- Okay.
- And, Ryan and I

382
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,300
will stay here on this side of the

383
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,120
tail end of the flamingo.

384
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,953
- Awesome.

385
00:12:18,953 --> 00:12:20,278
- Okay.
- So, by the way,

386
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:21,179
happy Fourth of July.

387
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:22,918
- Thank you, so much.
- You look great!

388
00:12:22,918 --> 00:12:24,370
- Thank you, thank you.
- Yeah, you look adorable.

389
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,070
- [Ryan] What is your first statement?

390
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,620
- My first statement is that every summer,

391
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,240
my family and I,

392
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,410
we have a friend who's in marketing,

393
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,490
and we get a billboard,

394
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,600
a vinyl billboard,

395
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,835
rip the whole thing down,

396
00:12:34,835 --> 00:12:36,380
put it down the hill,

397
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,213
in their backyard,

398
00:12:37,213 --> 00:12:38,554
and we water-slide down the billboard.

399
00:12:38,554 --> 00:12:40,253
- Ooh!
- Oh, that sounds like fun.

400
00:12:40,253 --> 00:12:41,500
- You steal the billboard

401
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,590
from--
- No, he's in marketing.

402
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,800
So, they're old billboards.
- They're old, so it's fine.

403
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,683
Okay, and what's your second
- Yeah.

404
00:12:45,683 --> 00:12:47,480
- Statement?
- My second statement is that

405
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,440
every Fourth of July,

406
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,910
my husband and I are in the town parade,

407
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,190
and we're a husband and
wife real-estate team.

408
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:53,920
So, I dressed up as the Statue of Liberty,

409
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,130
and we have a big American flag,

410
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:56,263
and we throw out candy in the parade.

411
00:12:56,263 --> 00:12:58,010
- [Ryan] But, he's in
marketing, I thought?

412
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:58,843
- No, a friend is

413
00:12:58,843 --> 00:12:59,830
in marketing.
- Oh.

414
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:00,663
Well, let's see what the

415
00:13:00,663 --> 00:13:02,230
audience thinks on this.
- I don't know.

416
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,946
You've got an honest face.

417
00:13:03,946 --> 00:13:05,040
- I am honest.
- You do.

418
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,770
Sliding down the vinyl billboard.

419
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,750
- Huh.
- So, you put water on it?

420
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,110
- Yeah, we get a hose
and put it at the top--

421
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,143
- Do you use soap?

422
00:13:13,143 --> 00:13:14,270
Like a liquid soap?
- Yep, we get dish

423
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,103
soap at the top,

424
00:13:15,103 --> 00:13:15,936
and the kids all squirt

425
00:13:15,936 --> 00:13:16,769
it down the top.
- That sounds dangerous.

426
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:18,360
Like, you could really hurt yourselves.

427
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,100
- That sounds fun.
- Even on the Slip N Slide.

428
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,470
Right? Don't they say adults
- It's a grass hill.

429
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:22,910
Over the age of 12,

430
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:25,330
and if you weigh more
than blah, blah, blah.

431
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:26,630
- [Holly] It's a grass hill.

432
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,163
- It's a grass hill?

433
00:13:28,163 --> 00:13:30,085
I like that story.
- Okay.

434
00:13:30,085 --> 00:13:31,200
- What do you think?

435
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,650
- I think that that's...

436
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:33,910
Okay, I'm gonna...

437
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:34,770
I don't wanna...

438
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:35,790
It's the Fourth of July.

439
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,757
So, for the sake of harmony,

440
00:13:36,757 --> 00:13:38,120
- Yeah?
- I'm gonna go with you.

441
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,610
But, in the back of my mind,

442
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,830
I want it noted,

443
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:43,340
that I actually believe that is B.S..

444
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,010
Okay?
(audience laughs)

445
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:47,090
- In the name of harmony,

446
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:50,500
is it true that you
slide down the billboard?

447
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,337
- Am I supposed to tell you

448
00:13:51,337 --> 00:13:52,170
right now?
- Yes, right now.

449
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,354
- Yes, it's true.
- Yay!

450
00:13:53,354 --> 00:13:54,187
(laughing)

451
00:13:54,187 --> 00:13:55,510
(audience applauding and cheering)

452
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,710
- Happy holiday.
- Wow.

453
00:13:57,638 --> 00:13:58,471
- Thank you, audience.

454
00:13:58,471 --> 00:13:59,304
Thank you.
- Wow.

455
00:13:59,304 --> 00:14:00,137
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

456
00:14:00,137 --> 00:14:02,890
- Now you, and a lucky member
of our studio audience,

457
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:05,260
will each receive a $500 gift card

458
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,510
from World Market.
- Ah!

459
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:08,514
Yeah!

460
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,515
Fourth of July.

461
00:14:10,515 --> 00:14:11,714
- Fish bowl.
- Huh?

462
00:14:11,714 --> 00:14:12,570
Oh, fish bowl.
- Right here.

463
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:13,790
- Yeah, sorry.
- I got your tickets,

464
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,690
everybody.
- There's nothing like doing

465
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:16,880
this show like it's

466
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,846
the first time.
- Like it's...

467
00:14:17,846 --> 00:14:18,679
We've ever done it.

468
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:20,750
- Even though it's my 9,000th show.

469
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,583
Uh...

470
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:22,869
40, number 40.
- Number 40.

471
00:14:22,869 --> 00:14:23,702
(audience cheering)

472
00:14:23,702 --> 00:14:24,922
- Yeah!
- Right there?

473
00:14:24,922 --> 00:14:25,943
(audience applauding and cheering)

474
00:14:25,943 --> 00:14:26,776
- [Woman] Woo!

475
00:14:26,776 --> 00:14:28,221
(Kelly laughs)

476
00:14:28,221 --> 00:14:29,054
- Happy Fourth.

477
00:14:29,054 --> 00:14:29,887
Thank you so much,
- Thank you.

478
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,720
- For being here.
- Thank you, very much.

479
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,553
Thanks.
- Let's see.

480
00:14:31,553 --> 00:14:33,110
Now, dim the light, because...

481
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,115
- Oh, is this where
- Oh, this is exciting.

482
00:14:34,115 --> 00:14:34,948
- We reveal the winning

483
00:14:34,948 --> 00:14:35,781
dancer?
- The results.

484
00:14:35,781 --> 00:14:38,841
- Oh my gosh.
- Of our dance-off are in.

485
00:14:38,841 --> 00:14:39,674
(dramatic drum roll)

486
00:14:39,674 --> 00:14:42,590
The person voted as this year's winner,

487
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:47,590
and getting a $500 gift
certificate to Omaha Steaks,

488
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,150
is...

- [Narrator] For mild to moderate eczema,

515
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,340
Eucrisa can be used almost everywhere.

516
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,610
On almost every body.

517
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:53,780
Like the hands of a hair stylist.

518
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,990
Or the calf of a cutie.

519
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:58,110
Prescription Eucrisa works at, and below,

520
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,470
the surface of the skin.

521
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,950
It blocks overactive PDE4 enzymes.

522
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:04,480
Which is believed to reduce inflammation.

523
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,170
- And, it's steroid free.

524
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,950

you are allergic to Eucrisa,

or it's ingredients.

526

Allergic reactions may occur

527
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,300
at or near the application site.

528
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,480
The most common side effect

529
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,950
is application site pain.

530
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:17,080
Ask your doctor about Eucrisa.

00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,410
but I know what can wind Kelly up.

654
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:09,590
- Like what?

655
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,070
What's one thing that can wind me up?

656
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,270
- Serving you garlic.

657
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,432
- Oh, that is true.

658
00:20:13,432 --> 00:20:14,277
- Oh, yeah.
- You put garlic

659
00:20:14,277 --> 00:20:15,252
in any of her food--
- I love garlic.

660
00:20:15,252 --> 00:20:16,085
- You do?
- Me too.

661
00:20:16,085 --> 00:20:17,094
I love it too.
- Really?

662
00:20:17,094 --> 00:20:18,852
- Oh, it's awesome.
- I'm very sensitive to it.

663
00:20:18,852 --> 00:20:20,280
- Very sensitive to garlic.
- Oh.

664
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,610
- Do you guys know little
things about each other now?

665
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:23,443
Or, do you like the--
- I thought you were about

666
00:20:23,443 --> 00:20:25,495
to ask us if we knew
anything about garlic.

667
00:20:25,495 --> 00:20:27,213
(laughing)
I was like um, well.

668
00:20:28,793 --> 00:20:30,650
- Caleb's always blowing his nose.

669
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:31,845
All the time.
- Oh, really?

670
00:20:31,845 --> 00:20:32,678
- Yeah.
- Yes.

671
00:20:32,678 --> 00:20:33,511
- Every day of his life.

672
00:20:33,511 --> 00:20:34,344
- You know why?

673
00:20:34,344 --> 00:20:37,000
I have PTSD as a child.
- Okay.

674
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,290
- I look at old pictures of my young self,

675
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:41,723
and there's a lot of boogers.

676
00:20:41,723 --> 00:20:43,598
So, I...
(laughing)

677
00:20:43,598 --> 00:20:45,120
I also...
- Yeah.

678
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,140
- I suffer from that,

679
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:46,973
and I'm like,

680
00:20:46,973 --> 00:20:49,319
I make sure there is
no boogers in my nose.

681
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:50,152
- Wait, do you--
- So...

682
00:20:50,152 --> 00:20:51,287
- Caleb, do you have like,

683
00:20:51,287 --> 00:20:52,140
boogers--
- So, every time I feel

684
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,070
something, I'm like--
- Older siblings?

685
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:53,903
- Yeah, I do.

686
00:20:53,903 --> 00:20:55,060
But, they won't tell me.
- They didn't tell you.

687
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:55,893
- Nah.
- That's right, yeah.

688
00:20:55,893 --> 00:20:57,920
- You should have people
on the set that tell you

689
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,753
whether you have boogers--
- Oh, they do.

690
00:20:58,753 --> 00:20:59,586
- They do.
- But, I just,

691
00:20:59,586 --> 00:21:00,419
when I feel something,

692
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:02,120
I'm like, can I get a tissue?

693
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,190
- Yeah, it's not there.
- There is also--

694
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,390
- Kelly loves a snot rocket.

695
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:05,280
She just (whistles), fires it right out.

696
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,900
- Well, it comes to the
point where it's like,

697
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,476
we're doing a really serious scene,

698
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:10,650
and Caleb's off camera,
- Oh, yeah.

699
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:11,483
- And I'm like doing,

700
00:21:11,483 --> 00:21:12,321
and I'm doing the scene,

701
00:21:12,321 --> 00:21:13,987
I look at Caleb, and he's like--

702
00:21:13,987 --> 00:21:15,073
(laughing)

703
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:16,740
As quietly as he can.

704
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,750
- Every picture of myself
as a three-year-old child,

705
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,575
it's just shiny boogers.

706
00:21:21,575 --> 00:21:23,463
- Oh, that's with every kid.
- Delicious.

707
00:21:23,463 --> 00:21:24,754
- We've been doing scenes...
- Delicious.

708
00:21:24,754 --> 00:21:25,690
- We've been doing scenes,

709
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:27,720
and like, the camera will be on one of us,

710
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,880
and like, he'll be behind the camera,

711
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,810
reading for us,

712
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:31,160
and he'll just be blowing his nose

713
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,160
during the middle of the shot.

714
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,813
I'm like dude, really?
- Yeah.

715
00:21:33,813 --> 00:21:34,646
(laughing)

716
00:21:34,646 --> 00:21:35,479
- And then, it makes me laugh so much.

717
00:21:35,479 --> 00:21:36,823
Like, when the cameras--
- It makes me laugh so much.

718
00:21:36,823 --> 00:21:37,656
- Well, what does Gaten do?

719
00:21:37,656 --> 00:21:39,058
Finn, what does Gaten do?

720
00:21:39,058 --> 00:21:39,891
- Uh...
- He's perfect.

721
00:21:39,891 --> 00:21:40,724
He's from New Jersey.
- A lot.

722
00:21:40,724 --> 00:21:41,899
- Gaten...
- Gaten does like--

723
00:21:41,899 --> 00:21:43,450
- Yeah, Gaten does a lot.
- Gaten just dances (mumbles).

724
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:45,479
- He dances, and sings a lot.
- He's always (mumbles).

725
00:21:45,479 --> 00:21:46,869
- Well, 'cause he's happy.

726
00:21:46,869 --> 00:21:48,044
He's from New Jersey.
- I'm happy.

727
00:21:48,044 --> 00:21:49,950
- That's great.
- Jersey's not happy.

728
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:50,800
- Jersey--
- Yes, yes.

729
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,872
- [Noah] Are all people
from New Jersey happy?

730
00:21:52,872 --> 00:21:54,752
- Yes, we're all happy.
- No (laughs).

731
00:21:54,752 --> 00:21:56,589
- We are, listen, we are happy.

732
00:21:56,589 --> 00:21:57,839
And, if you question us,
- We're happier,

733
00:21:57,839 --> 00:21:59,333
- We will fight you about it.
- And we're nicer.

734
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:00,802
- That's how happy we are.
- Yeah, that's right.

735
00:22:00,802 --> 00:22:01,720
That's right.
- We are intense.

736
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,553
- We will beat you up,
- We will fight you about it.

737
00:22:02,553 --> 00:22:03,740
- Over how happy we are.
- Now, who has

738
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,320
their driver's license among you?

739
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,153
- Oh.
- I have my permit.

740
00:22:06,153 --> 00:22:06,986
- No on has it.
- Good question.

741
00:22:06,986 --> 00:22:09,120
- I have my permit.
- You're permitted?

742
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,760
- Yeah, I get my license in September.

743
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,600
- Oh, you do?
- Are you excited?

744
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,871
- Yeah, I am excited.
- And, I get my license

745
00:22:14,871 --> 00:22:15,704
when I turn 18.

746
00:22:15,704 --> 00:22:17,420
- When you turn 18?
- Yeah, this year, this year.

747
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,635
- Yeah, okay.
- I'm 14 years (mumbles).

748
00:22:19,635 --> 00:22:22,180
- You're 14!
- But, I can get my (mumbles).

749
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,520
- Go-karts. I got a...

750
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,610
I went in for the first
learners-permit test,

751
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:29,220
really excited,

752
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,940
and I got (stammers),

753
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,290
I didn't get every question wrong,

754
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:34,274
but...
(laughing)

755
00:22:34,274 --> 00:22:38,110
(stammers) It's why I chose
acting over academics,

756
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:40,552
and...
(laughing)

757
00:22:40,552 --> 00:22:42,440
And, I got one question wrong.

758
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,527
It was like the passing thing,

759
00:22:43,527 --> 00:22:46,600
(stammers) I like, just
like, held my head low,

760
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,433
and like, I got up,

761
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:48,810
and my mom was like, "Did you pass?"

762
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:50,491
And, I was just like, "Let's go."

763
00:22:50,491 --> 00:22:51,566
- You know what?
- Listen--

764
00:22:51,566 --> 00:22:52,800
(Kelly stammers)
- We'll be fine.

765
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,633
- Get chauffeurs.

766
00:22:53,633 --> 00:22:54,500
You're on a hit show
- Yeah.

767
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,744
- For God sakes.
- I wanna drive.

768
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,950
(muffled crosstalk)

769
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,790
(audience applauding and cheering)

770
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:01,060
- Is everyone a chauffeur,
in the audience?

771
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:01,920
We got a chauffeur's

772
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,753
audience.
- Yeah.

773
00:23:02,753 --> 00:23:03,586
Well, we--
- Now that I'm

774
00:23:03,586 --> 00:23:07,449
finally driving, I don't
like being a passenger.

775
00:23:07,449 --> 00:23:08,282
At all.
- Oh.

776
00:23:08,282 --> 00:23:09,217
- 'Cause, you wanna be in control?

777
00:23:09,217 --> 00:23:10,300
- I do.
- Backseat driver.

778
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,133
- It's weird.

779
00:23:11,133 --> 00:23:11,990
I'm not a backseat driver.

780
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,622
I try not to be.

781
00:23:13,622 --> 00:23:15,400
It was funny, my uncle,

782
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,233
my mom's twin brother,

783
00:23:16,233 --> 00:23:19,080
told her, when she first started driving,

784
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,630
'cause he got his license first,

785
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:23,420
that if there was a white
line around a stop sign,

786
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,960
it was optional.
- What?

787
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,090
(laughing)

788
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:27,070
- That's really funny.
- And, for those of you

789
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,537
who don't know,

790
00:23:28,537 --> 00:23:29,603
I'm sure most of you do,

791
00:23:29,603 --> 00:23:30,949
- That's very funny.
- Most stop signs have a

792
00:23:30,949 --> 00:23:32,603
white line around them.

793
00:23:32,603 --> 00:23:34,080
And, it took her like,

794
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,483
three months to realize that was not true.

795
00:23:38,656 --> 00:23:39,798
- So, how many stop signs

796
00:23:39,798 --> 00:23:40,631
did she run?
- No one was hurt.

797
00:23:40,631 --> 00:23:41,464
No one was hurt.

798
00:23:41,464 --> 00:23:43,160
Everyone was fine.
- Nobody was hurt.

799
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,400
I love that.
- So, you guys are

800
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,047
on this massively popular
show, "Stranger Things."

801
00:23:48,047 --> 00:23:49,005
- I'm like, falling.
- That's alright,

802
00:23:49,005 --> 00:23:49,838
there's a hole there.
- I know.

803
00:23:49,838 --> 00:23:51,360
There's a hole we designed.
- We created.

804
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,193
- Yeah.

805
00:23:52,193 --> 00:23:53,320
Just lean back, and relax.

806
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,578
Yeah, come on.
- Is it difficult

807
00:23:54,578 --> 00:23:57,240
to keep the secrets of the show?

808
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,320
- Is it difficult to keep--
- Because, people are always

809
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,350
wanting to know what's coming up,

810
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,873
what's happening, right?
- I feel like, nowadays,

811
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:03,340
because we're in season three,

812
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,840
in the beginning it wasn't so hard,

813
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,220
because nothing was out.

814
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:09,000
But now, I forget which
season I'm talking about.

815
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,833
- Yeah, same.
- And then,

816
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:11,800
I might spoil something.
- Right.

817
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,840
- Or, say something about
the season that's coming out.

818
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,370
But, no one catches it.
- In season one,

819
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:17,203
we told everybody like,

820
00:24:17,203 --> 00:24:18,390
the entire plot line.
- Yeah.

821
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,950
- Was spoiling everything.
- Well, we were like,

822
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,654
okay, so like,
- Yeah (laughs).

823
00:24:22,654 --> 00:24:24,030
- (stammers) There's
this girl named Eleven,

824
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:24,863
and then at the end,

825
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:25,850
she disappears.
- Yeah.

826
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:29,298
Everybody's like, good show.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

827
00:24:29,298 --> 00:24:31,085
- Good luck with that.
- We were telling everybody.

828
00:24:31,085 --> 00:24:31,930
- Yeah, and then we were like,

829
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,760
yeah, that was probably it.

830
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,980
Like, whatever.
- But, you do realize that

831
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,810
you are portraying the greatest time

832
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,136
in the history of time,

833
00:24:39,136 --> 00:24:40,232
the '80s.
- The '80s.

834
00:24:40,232 --> 00:24:41,065
- Yeah.

835
00:24:41,065 --> 00:24:43,500
- Like, our parents are always
telling us that they love it.

836
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,560
- Your parents are
literally telling you what

837
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,170
it was like during--
- Yeah, my parents relate

838
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:48,120
to everything that like,

839
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,470
the towels that we have,

840
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:50,303
or, not the towels,

841
00:24:50,303 --> 00:24:51,300
our shirts like,

842
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,701
have like towel material.
- Yes, of course.

843
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:54,534
- Terry cloth.

844
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:55,367
- Terry cloth.
- Terry cloth.

845
00:24:55,367 --> 00:24:56,903
- They wore that.
- Towel material.

846
00:24:56,903 --> 00:24:58,480
That was so cute.
- Towel material.

847
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,430
- That was adorable.

848
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,630
My kids, for the first time,

849
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,360
saw a wall phone,
(laughing)

850
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,330
on "Stranger Things,"

851
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:04,163
and they said,

852
00:25:04,163 --> 00:25:05,884
"What is that thing--"
(muffled crosstalk)

853
00:25:05,884 --> 00:25:07,204
They had never seen a wall phone.

854
00:25:07,204 --> 00:25:08,450
- There's like, a whole bunch in

855
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:09,727
New York City.
- Okay, I doubt,

856
00:25:09,727 --> 00:25:11,290
before you did "Stranger Things,"

857
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:12,294
if you really think back--

858
00:25:12,294 --> 00:25:13,770
- I knew what a rotary phone--
- Hey, Jersey,

859
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:14,865
calm down, you two.
- I knew what a

860
00:25:14,865 --> 00:25:16,234
rotary phone was.
- Listen, I will--

861
00:25:16,234 --> 00:25:17,267
- We're gonna take a break.

862
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:19,371
Coming up, things get
strange when the guys

863
00:25:19,371 --> 00:25:20,842
play a hands-on guessing game,

864
00:25:20,842 --> 00:25:21,675
right after this.

865
00:25:21,675 --> 00:25:22,608
Stay with us.

866
00:25:22,608 --> 00:25:27,608

- [Announcer] Still ahead, on Live,

868
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:31,628
A performance by house band, O.A.R.

869
00:25:31,628 --> 00:25:36,628
(upbeat music)
(applause and cheering)

870
00:25:39,995 --> 00:25:41,140
(illuminating music)

871
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,770
- My body is truly powerful.

872
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:47,238
- I have the power to lower
my blood-sugar and A1C.

873
00:25:47,238 --> 00:25:49,340
- I guess I can still make my own insulin,

874
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,910
and Trulicity activates my body,

875
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:51,870
to release it

876
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:52,950
like it's supposed to.

877
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:55,410
- [Narrator] Trulicity is for
people with type 2 diabetes.

878
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:56,590
It's not insulin.

879
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,520
- [Man] I take it once a week.

880
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,940
It starts acting in my
body from the first dose.

881
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:00,960
- [Narrator] Trulicity isn't for

882
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,480
people with type 1 diabetes,

883
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,290
or diabetic ketoacidosis.

884
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:06,540
Don't take Trulicity if
you're allergic to it,

885
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:09,010
you or your family have
medullary thyroid cancer,

886
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:12,000
or have multiple endocrine
neoplasia syndrome type 2.

887
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,210
Stop Trulicity and call
your doctor right away

888
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,408
if you have an allergic reaction,

889
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:17,040
a lump or swelling in your neck,

890
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,360
or severe stomach pain.

891
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,920
Serious side effects may
include pancreatitis.

892
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,830
Taking Trulicity with a
sulfonylurea, or insulin,

893
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,560
increases low-blood-sugar risk.

894
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,010
Side effects include nausea,

895
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:30,200
diarrhea, vomiting, belly
pain, and decreased appetite,

896
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,590
which lead to dehydration,

897
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,910
and may worsen kidney problems.

898
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:36,940
- I have it within me to lower my A1C.

899
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,190
- [Narrator] Ask your
doctor about Trulicity.

900

(cars driving past)

901
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:44,500
- How would I describe
overpaying on a used car?

902
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,333
It's humiliating!

903
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:46,960
And, It's expensive!

904
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,573
I just trusted the wrong used car sites.

905
00:26:50,573 --> 00:26:51,406

- I'm sure people have already binged

954
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,250
the entire season.
- Done.

955

- She, she knows--
- Yes, I know

972
00:28:57,331 --> 00:28:58,390
what's in the box.
- No!

973
00:28:58,390 --> 00:28:59,223
- We do not.

974
00:28:59,223 --> 00:29:00,289
And, we each have a hole.
- It is disgusting.

975
00:29:00,289 --> 00:29:01,122
- Here we go.
- Let's go, alright?

976
00:29:01,122 --> 00:29:03,870
- One, two, three.
- Two, three, do it.

977
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:04,703
(screaming)

978
00:29:04,703 --> 00:29:05,536
- Oh my God, it's oatmeal!
- Mmm.

979
00:29:05,536 --> 00:29:06,560
- It's oatmeal.
- Feels like oatmeal.

980
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,224
- That's oatmeal.

981
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,723
- Oh my God, it's disgusting.
- You are incorrect.

982
00:29:09,723 --> 00:29:11,430
- Wait, wait.
- It is relish.

983
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:13,090
- I knew it was relish.
- Oh, you can see.

984
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:14,870
- I smelled it.
- Gross.

985
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,534
- Ayy, I just--
- Gross!

986
00:29:16,534 --> 00:29:17,992
(Kelly laughs)
(Ryan mumbles)

987
00:29:17,992 --> 00:29:19,748
- No, that's okay.
- I didn't even say my answer.

988
00:29:19,748 --> 00:29:20,889
- Next.
- Alright, next one.

989
00:29:20,889 --> 00:29:21,880
Next one, next one.
- Next one.

990
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,338
- So, you just put your hand
in the relish for no reason.

991
00:29:24,338 --> 00:29:25,413
- For no reason.
- I didn't.

992
00:29:25,413 --> 00:29:26,803
- You didn't put your hand in the relish?

993
00:29:26,803 --> 00:29:27,636
- Here's towels.
- Wait, you didn't

994
00:29:27,636 --> 00:29:28,469
put your hand in?

995
00:29:28,469 --> 00:29:29,302
That's so unfair.

996
00:29:29,302 --> 00:29:30,223
- 'Cause, everyone went in.
- You know what?

997
00:29:30,223 --> 00:29:31,370
Finn is a thinker.

998
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:32,203
See this, he's like,

999
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:33,036
"I'm not putting my

1000
00:29:33,036 --> 00:29:34,342
hand in there."
- I double cross everyone.

1001
00:29:34,342 --> 00:29:35,175
Everyone went in,

1002
00:29:35,175 --> 00:29:36,940
and I was like "No."
- Next one, next one.

1003
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,040
- Okay, next one.

1004
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,853
On your mark, get set, go.

1005
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,650
- Jello!
- Oh.

1006
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:43,010
- No, it's Jello.
- You are correct!

1007
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,410
- Ooh.
- Yes, Jello.

1008
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:46,991
- Oh yeah, that feels so good.
- Doesn't feel as

1009
00:29:46,991 --> 00:29:48,820
gross as the relish.
- Ew dude, don't eat it.

1010
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,653
- It's Jello.

1011
00:29:49,653 --> 00:29:51,557
- Ew, that's disgusting.
- It's Jello, it's Jello.

1012
00:29:51,557 --> 00:29:52,786
- It's like relish-Jello.
- It's relish-Jello.

1013
00:29:52,786 --> 00:29:53,754
- Oh, we don't have to
wipe our hands then.

1014
00:29:53,754 --> 00:29:54,587
- Did it taste a
- Rello.

1015
00:29:54,587 --> 00:29:55,420
- Little bit like relish?

1016
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,425
Yeah, it's like Rello.
- No, like Jello.

1017
00:29:56,425 --> 00:29:57,638
- Jello, okay good.
- Like Rello?

1018
00:29:57,638 --> 00:29:58,650
- Alright, good.
- Alright, next one.

1019
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:00,570
- Next one, number three.

1020
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:01,829
- Just--
- A marshmallow fluff!

1021
00:30:01,829 --> 00:30:02,741
- Oh, it's marshmell--

1022
00:30:02,741 --> 00:30:04,267
Oh, it feels like a pillow!
- No, it is...

1023
00:30:04,267 --> 00:30:05,570
- Oh, oh, cream!
- Shaving cream?

1024
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:06,511
- Shaving cream!

1025
00:30:06,511 --> 00:30:07,344
- Shaving cream.
- Yes!

1026
00:30:07,344 --> 00:30:08,177
- It smells like

1027
00:30:08,177 --> 00:30:09,010
shaving cream.
- You are correct!

1028
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:10,642
Shaving cream!
- High-five, high-five.

1029
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:11,530
- This the first (mumbles).
- High-five.

1030
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:12,922
Okay.
- Get it together.

1031
00:30:12,922 --> 00:30:13,755
- You still have relish

1032
00:30:13,755 --> 00:30:15,155
on your hands.
- Noah!

1033
00:30:15,155 --> 00:30:15,988
- Oh my God,

1034
00:30:15,988 --> 00:30:16,821
this feels so nice.
- It smells so good.

1035
00:30:16,821 --> 00:30:18,030
- I should go, tempting.
- You guys...

1036
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,188
- Oh.
- Smells so good.

1037
00:30:19,188 --> 00:30:20,096
You guys...
- Oh.

1038
00:30:20,096 --> 00:30:21,048
- Alright, next one.
- Try me.

1039
00:30:21,048 --> 00:30:22,128
(laughing)

1040
00:30:22,128 --> 00:30:23,751
- Aright, aright, cool.
- Alright, get in there,

1041
00:30:23,751 --> 00:30:24,584
get in there, get in there.

1042
00:30:24,584 --> 00:30:25,631
- I guess I'm--
- You know what?

1043
00:30:25,631 --> 00:30:27,610
- Great!
- Finn, the Canadian,

1044
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:29,230
could be my favorite new player

1045
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:30,176
of this game.
- Finn's Canadian.

1046
00:30:30,176 --> 00:30:31,009
- Why?

1047
00:30:31,009 --> 00:30:31,842
- Can that be his
- Finn, have you put your

1048
00:30:31,842 --> 00:30:32,675
- Official new name?
- Hands in anything yet?

1049
00:30:32,675 --> 00:30:34,050
- Yes, look at his hands.
- Okay, alright.

1050
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:34,938
I thought for sure he
- No.

1051
00:30:34,938 --> 00:30:36,080
- Was three for three.
- Not anymore, Finn.

1052
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:36,913
- I have not.

1053
00:30:36,913 --> 00:30:37,989
- You could not get this
- Okay, next one.

1054
00:30:37,989 --> 00:30:38,822
- Off your hands, can you?
- Next one.

1055
00:30:38,822 --> 00:30:39,870
- Feels so nice.

1056
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:41,447
- Okay.
- Okay, do it.

1057
00:30:42,368 --> 00:30:43,819
- [Ryan] Oh, this feels great.

1058
00:30:43,819 --> 00:30:45,523
Worms.
- Oh, worms, gummy worms.

1059
00:30:45,523 --> 00:30:46,973
- Gummy, um...

1060
00:30:46,973 --> 00:30:47,806
It's a gummy worm, right?

1061
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:48,765
- Yeah, they are gummy worms.
- It's gummy worms.

1062
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:50,354
(muffled crosstalk)

1063
00:30:50,354 --> 00:30:51,460
- Yeah, I felt worms--
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1064
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,103
You're like--
- I felt worms on

1065
00:30:53,103 --> 00:30:54,490
this show before.
- Yeah!

1066
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:55,709
- I just wanna say one thing.

1067
00:30:55,709 --> 00:30:57,477
(stammers) Ryan is cheating.

1068
00:30:57,477 --> 00:30:58,904
- [Ryan] So, they feel like real worms.

1069
00:30:58,904 --> 00:30:59,737
- Oh.
- Yeah.

1070
00:30:59,737 --> 00:31:01,180
- Ryan?
- Ryan, you're not allowed

1071
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,471
to pull it out of the thing.

1072
00:31:02,471 --> 00:31:03,304
- Ryan!
- Oh that's...

1073
00:31:03,304 --> 00:31:05,281
Now you tell me.
- Just telling you.

1074
00:31:05,281 --> 00:31:06,529
Those are the rules.
- I didn't hear

1075
00:31:06,529 --> 00:31:07,362
that in the rules.

1076
00:31:07,362 --> 00:31:08,462
You can't pull it outta the thing.

1077
00:31:08,462 --> 00:31:10,170
- This is for all the marbles.

1078
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:11,230
- Let's get to the next box.

1079
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,063
I won't pull it out of

1080
00:31:12,063 --> 00:31:12,896
this thing.
- This is for

1081
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:14,129
all the marbles.
- All I got from this was--

1082
00:31:14,129 --> 00:31:14,962
- High-five, high-five,

1083
00:31:14,962 --> 00:31:16,020
high-fave, partner.
(laughing)

1084
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,263
- Oh!
- Alright, next one.

1085
00:31:17,263 --> 00:31:19,034
- Real consequence--
- Wait, Finn, what is it?

1086
00:31:19,034 --> 00:31:20,171
All you got from this is what?

1087
00:31:20,171 --> 00:31:22,050
- Clean hands.
- Clean hands.

1088
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:23,174
- And, a clean shave.
- See that.

1089
00:31:23,174 --> 00:31:24,507
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1090
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:25,863
- Okay, guys.
- This is the final box.

1091
00:31:25,863 --> 00:31:26,696
- This is the final one,

1092
00:31:26,696 --> 00:31:28,030
and this one is...
- Oh yeah.

1093
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:28,863
- You earn your--

1094
00:31:28,863 --> 00:31:29,888
- No!
- Come on.

1095
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:30,721
- What is it?
- Do it.

1096
00:31:30,721 --> 00:31:31,712
- Oh my God.
- I don't know.

1097
00:31:31,712 --> 00:31:32,650
What do you think it is?
- Stop.

1098
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:33,858
- Wait, Noah, no. Wait, not yet.

1099
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:34,733
- Oh, I thought we were

1100
00:31:34,733 --> 00:31:35,566
going in.
- It's already in.

1101
00:31:35,566 --> 00:31:36,399
It's already in (gasps).
- What do you think it is?

1102
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:37,232
- Nope.
- It feels like an intestine.

1103
00:31:37,232 --> 00:31:38,065
- I don't even know what that is.

1104
00:31:38,065 --> 00:31:38,898
- Spaghetti?
- I don't wanna know

1105
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:39,731
what that is.
- EW.

1106
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:40,620
Oh my gosh, meatballs.
- It's not spaghetti.

1107
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,586
- Meatballs!
- It's not spaghetti.

1108
00:31:41,586 --> 00:31:42,858
Not meatballs.
- Is it chicken?

1109
00:31:42,858 --> 00:31:43,724
- Ground meat?
- Is it chicken?

1110
00:31:43,724 --> 00:31:44,796
- Is it manure?
- Ground beef?

1111
00:31:44,796 --> 00:31:46,301
- It's not manure.
- Is it something--

1112
00:31:46,301 --> 00:31:47,667
- Oh!
- It's a liver?

1113
00:31:47,667 --> 00:31:48,584
- I feel it!
- Nope.

1114
00:31:48,584 --> 00:31:50,054
- It's ground beef.
- I'm squeezing it.

1115
00:31:50,054 --> 00:31:52,043
- It's ground beef.
- It's not ground beef.

1116
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:52,876
- [Ryan] Alright, we're out of

1117
00:31:52,876 --> 00:31:53,709
guesses.
- You ready?

1118
00:31:53,709 --> 00:31:54,542
- Steak?
- Reveal.

1119
00:31:54,542 --> 00:31:55,957
- It's not snake.
- Steak!

1120
00:31:55,957 --> 00:31:56,988
- It is, oh.

1121
00:31:56,988 --> 00:31:58,635
No, it's wet hotdog buns.

1122
00:31:58,635 --> 00:31:59,468
- Oh.
- Ew!

1123
00:31:59,468 --> 00:32:01,091
(audience laughing and scoffing)

1124
00:32:01,091 --> 00:32:02,072

We've recovered from that,

1444
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,980
and we're back.

1445
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:22,813
- How do you feel?

1446
00:42:22,813 --> 00:42:23,680
Are you okay?
- I'm sore.

1447
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,513
I'm bruised.

1448
00:42:24,513 --> 00:42:25,576
- Aw.
- I was strangled.

1449
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:26,600
- Aw.
(audience laughing)

1450
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,020
- I mean, you have lots
of illegal moves there.

1451
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,540
I watched the tape in the break.

1452
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,220
- The only move that I heard,

1453
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,053
that was illegal,

1454
00:42:32,053 --> 00:42:33,580
was taking your blue necklaces,

1455
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:35,804
and throwing them outside the ball pit.

1456
00:42:35,804 --> 00:42:36,910
- That's...
(audience laughing)

1457
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:37,840
That's right, cheater.

1458
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,020
- That's right.

1459
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,403
It wouldn't be a Fourth of July party

1460
00:42:40,403 --> 00:42:42,650
without a fun game of cornhole.

1461
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:43,698
- Alright.
- Mhm.

1462
00:42:43,698 --> 00:42:45,210
(audience applauding and cheering)

1463
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:46,820
- But--
- Today...

1464
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:49,020
The highest ranked
players will be competing

1465
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:52,410
against each other at the
National Cornhole Championship.

1466
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:54,400
- We have the top male,

1467
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,930
and top female competitors,

1468
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:59,020
from the American Cornhole
League here today.

1469
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:00,810
Please welcome Cody Henderson,

1470
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:02,711
and Stacia Pugh.
- Yeah!

1471
00:43:02,711 --> 00:43:07,711
(upbeat music)
(applauding and cheering)

1472
00:43:07,768 --> 00:43:09,018
- [Kelly] Yeah!

1473
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:10,841
- How are you?
- I'm good.

1474
00:43:10,841 --> 00:43:11,811
How are you?
- Hi, Cody.

1475
00:43:11,811 --> 00:43:13,020
I'm Kelly.
- Nice to meet you.

1476
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:14,298
- Hi, Stacia, I'm Kelly.

1477
00:43:14,298 --> 00:43:15,269
Nice to meet you.
- How are you?

1478
00:43:15,269 --> 00:43:16,485
Good to see you.

1479
00:43:16,485 --> 00:43:17,318
Come on...

1480
00:43:17,318 --> 00:43:18,151
Come over here.

1481
00:43:18,151 --> 00:43:19,059
There you go.

1482
00:43:19,059 --> 00:43:19,903
Okay, so--

1483
00:43:19,903 --> 00:43:21,920
- Cody, you are 27 years old.

1484
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:25,010
How did you get into
competitive corn-holing?

1485
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:26,320
- I got in, in high school.

1486
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,280
It was just a game.

1487
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,300
I liked to have fun.

1488
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:31,260
I found the professional circuit,

1489
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,600
and for the last eight years,

1490
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,510
I've been playing competitively.

1491
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:34,960
Traveling around the country.

1492
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:35,820
It's been quite the experience.

1493
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:38,200
- [Ryan] And Stacia, how about for you?

1494
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,140
- For me, I've been
playing about 10 years.

1495
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,560
Kinda started in the
front yard, with my dad.

1496
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,910
You know, at family events.

1497
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,020
Just realized I liked the game,

1498
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:47,700
and played more, and more (laughs).

1499
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:48,533
- Played more, and more.

1500
00:43:48,533 --> 00:43:50,170
Okay, is there something we should know?

1501
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:51,210
We're not very good

1502
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:52,676
corn-holers.
- Holers.

1503
00:43:52,676 --> 00:43:53,680
(laughing)

1504
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,427
- We found out, recently,

1505
00:43:55,427 --> 00:43:56,860
- We did.
- Last Fourth of July.

1506
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:57,920
- Embarrassingly, we did.

1507
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:58,960
- Is there a technique?

1508
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,400
Is there something we should know.

1509
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,233
Like, is there a twist?
- A wrist.

1510
00:44:01,233 --> 00:44:03,080
A release.
- A thing?

1511
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:03,913
- There is.
- Okay.

1512
00:44:03,913 --> 00:44:04,746
- I mean...

1513
00:44:04,746 --> 00:44:05,990
You know, when it comes to cornhole,

1514
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:08,070
if you can throw a flat bag,

1515
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:10,174
then you'll beat 90% of people.

1516
00:44:10,174 --> 00:44:11,007
- Alright.
- You know.

1517
00:44:11,007 --> 00:44:12,320
Right away.
- So, the bag should be flat?

1518
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,550
- Yes.
- Okay, got it.

1519
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:16,030
- Wait, I don't know if know (stammers).

1520
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:17,890
Okay, like this?
- Flat bag.

1521
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:18,960
- And, do you go like this?

1522
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:19,793
- Yes.
- Well, spin.

1523
00:44:19,793 --> 00:44:21,620
Like, a pizza.
- Like a pizza.

1524
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:22,680
- Like a pizza.
- See, we're getting

1525
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,630
more tips.
- Alright.

1526
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:24,769
Let's play.
- Alright, let's play.

1527
00:44:24,769 --> 00:44:25,955
(audience applauding and cheering)

1528
00:44:25,955 --> 00:44:27,137
- Girls, versus boys.

1529
00:44:27,137 --> 00:44:29,100
- Yeah.
- Okay, girls versus boys.

1530
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,057
You ready to lose again?
- Girls verse boys.

1531
00:44:30,057 --> 00:44:31,520
- Ugh, yes.
- Okay.

1532
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,510
- Come on.

1533
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:34,140
Let's go down here.
- Me, and you?

1534
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:35,449
(applause and cheering)

1535
00:44:35,449 --> 00:44:37,588
- [Stacia] So, you go
over there on that side.

1536
00:44:37,588 --> 00:44:39,463
- [Kelly] Now, am I allowed to block the--

1537
00:44:39,463 --> 00:44:40,780
- [Cody] No, you can't do any of that.

1538
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:42,640
- Okay.
- Can I hit Ryan

1539
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:43,826
for no reason?
- Yes.

1540
00:44:43,826 --> 00:44:44,729
- Okay.

1541
00:44:44,729 --> 00:44:47,317
(playful music)

1542
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:48,150
(thud)

1543
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:49,930
Oh my gosh.
- Yeah, nice flat spin.

1544
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:51,880
- Good spin, like a pizza.
- Yes.

1545
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,253
Walk it right up the board.

- Oh!
- Okay.

1552
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:07,461
So, one got knocked in.

1553
00:45:07,461 --> 00:45:08,311
What does that mean?

1554
00:45:08,311 --> 00:45:09,410
Does that count?
- It means we got a big deal.

1555
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:10,690
Yeah, we're tied up there.
- Okay.

1556
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:11,523
- Okay.
- That's pretty close.

1557
00:45:11,523 --> 00:45:13,170
- [Stacia] We call that a replacement bag.

1558
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:14,003
- [Kelly] A replacement bag?

1559
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:15,139
- Replacement bag.
- Okay, got it.

we calculated this?

three points there.

- Okay.
- No, so it would be

1583
00:45:50,032 --> 00:45:51,009
one on the board,

1584
00:45:51,009 --> 00:45:52,200

- Okay.
- Okay.

1588
00:45:55,673 --> 00:45:56,865
- [Cody] So, we have a three point lead.

1589

- You go first, right?

1590
00:45:57,913 --> 00:45:59,013
Right, Ry?
- You'll be on that side.

1591
00:45:59,013 --> 00:45:59,984
- Onto this side.

1592
00:45:59,984 --> 00:46:00,940
- Right there.
- You're across from me.

1593
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:02,380
- Okay, got it (laughs).

1594
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:04,140
- [Cody] Okay Ryan, (mumbles).

1595
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,250
- [Kelly] And, don't let any
of this make you nervous.

1596
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:07,137
Don't let this unnerve you.
- I don't think I

1597
00:46:07,137 --> 00:46:07,970
can do the pizza spin.

1598
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:09,410
- You can totally do the pizza.

1599
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:10,550
You love pizza.
- I do.

1600
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:12,432
But, I can't do the toss.
- Just try it.

1601
00:46:12,432 --> 00:46:13,660
Toss it.

1602
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:14,493

1889

Then it's time you discovered MyPillow.

1890
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,613
- Hello, I'm Mike Lindell,

1891
00:55:16,613 --> 00:55:17,862
inventor of MyPillow.

1892
00:55:17,862 --> 00:55:19,911
Just like you, I had problems sleeping.

1893
00:55:19,911 --> 00:55:21,910
I tried every pillow out there,

1894
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:22,950
and nothing worked.

1895
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:24,210
15 years ago,

1896
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:25,410
I invented MyPillow.

1897
00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:27,220
It took me two years to develop,

1898
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:29,040
because I wanted to have everything

1899
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,442
you would ever want in a pillow.

1900
00:55:30,442 --> 00:55:33,470
I made sure that you could
adjust my patented fill,

1901
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:34,820
so you could have the exact

1902
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:36,580
support you need as an individual.

1903
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:38,530
Regardless of your sleep position.

1904
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:40,370
I also wanted a pillow that would last.

1905
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:43,060
So, I made MyPillow machine
washable, and dryable.

1906
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:45,020
I back MyPillow with a 10 year warranty,

1907
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:46,741
and a 60 day money-back guarantee.

1908
00:55:46,741 --> 00:55:47,790
Not only that,

1909
00:55:47,790 --> 00:55:49,210
I do all my own manufacturing,

1910
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:50,940
in my home state of Minnesota.

1911

1916
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,010
- [Narrator] Other pillows go flat.

1917
00:56:03,010 --> 00:56:04,130
Causing you to fold them over,

1918
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:05,450
or use your arm for support.

1919
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:06,550
Which can cause pain.

1920
00:56:06,550 --> 00:56:08,640
Hard foam pillows can
raise your head too high,

1921
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:09,990
and heat up during the night.

1922
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:11,590
Making you very uncomfortable.

1923
00:56:11,590 --> 00:56:14,100
But, the revolutionary
MyPillow has patented fill

1924
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:15,260
that won't go flat,

1925
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:17,100
and helps keep your neck
