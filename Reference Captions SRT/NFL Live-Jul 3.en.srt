1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,530
- No, this is just who has the most,

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,180
remember they wanted to do a smaller deal.

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:05,180
- But they probably,

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,920
we heard Adrian talk about
it, there's no interest.

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:09,753
When there's no interest

6
00:00:09,753 --> 00:00:11,130
guess what kind of deals
are available to you?

7
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,430
The minimum exception,

8
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,060
so we might as well
put all 30 teams there.

9
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,400
- Right, no, that's very interesting.

10
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,080
Well, we're gonna have to see.

11
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,220
We might know more by tonight, right?

12
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,550
Could know about Kawhi by tonight,

13
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,420
could know about Boogie by tonight.

14
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,160
Come hang out with us,
7:00 Eastern on ESPN.

15
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,200
Until then watch your phones
'cause it's free agency.

16
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,490
Lots going on.
- Come on U.S. team,

17
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,057
let's do it.

18
00:00:31,057 --> 00:00:33,640
(upbeat music)

19
00:00:43,267 --> 00:00:46,260
- Coming up on this Tuesday
edition of NFL Live,

20
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,010
Juju Smith-Schuster joins us.

21
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:51,060
He'll talk about taking over
the Steeler's top receiver

22
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,760
and what his relationship with
Antonio Brown looks like now.

23
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,290
We highlights some of the NFL stars

24
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,890
that are nominated for ESPYS,

25
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,410
including a look back at Drew Brees'

26
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:03,280
record-breaking Monday
night football performance.

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,940
Plus, we hand out our
own award for the player

28
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,730
with the best highlights,
Patrick Mahomes, Sequon,

29
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,020
or Kyler in the running,

30
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,750
who will be crowned your highlight king?

31
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,160
Happy to have you with us
on this Tuesday afternoon,

32
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,280
holiday week.

33
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,410
Wendy Nix, Dianna Russini,
Victor Cruz and Mike Tannenbaum.

34
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:23,040
We will start with news regarding Cowboys

35
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,070
running back Ezekiel Elliot.

36
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:28,150
Zeke is once again headed
to the commissioners office.

37
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,510
The Dallas Cowboys running back

38
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:32,300
expected to meet with the
commissioner Roger Goodell today

39
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:36,950
in New York City regarding
a May incident in Las Vegas.

40
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,610
The meeting comes after an incident

41
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,550
at a Las Vegas music festival in May

42
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:43,100
in which Elliot had a
confrontation of sorts

43
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,150
with a security guard.

44
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,070
He was briefly detained but never arrested

45
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,280
or charged in the incident.

46
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,530
Nevertheless the Commissioner
wants to here him out,

47
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:54,250
hear what happened, Diana,
what more can you tell us?

48
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,220
- At this point right now

49
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,680
we don't know what exactly
is going on in that meeting

50
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,320
but they are meeting in Manhattan

51
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,660
to discuss Zeke's behavior
in that Las Vegas incident.

52
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,080
Jerry Jones, of course, has
stood by his running back,

53
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,220
saying that he doesn't see anything wrong

54
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,190
with what he saw on video tape.

55
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,270
Again, Zeke was in those handcuffs

56
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,120
and then those handcuffs were removed.

57
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,750
He was not charged, he
could still face punishment

58
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,190
if Goodell decides that he violated

59
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,240
the league's personal conduct policy

60
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,550
and that's what this meeting is to discuss

61
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,770
but as of now we are not
sure what the future holds

62
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:30,000
but those that I've spoken to
with the Cowboys organization,

63
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,840
strongly feel confident
that Zeke will not face

64
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,010
a suspension in this
because of this incident.

65
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,700
- Mike as a DM I know you had players

66
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,310
who had face-to-face meetings
with the commissioner,

67
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,420
who had hearings or due
diligence, if you will.

68
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,870
What's your take on the process?

69
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,830
- Yeah, despite how the
Cowboys are feeling,

70
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,900
a suspension certainly is in play.

71
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,140
We have to remember under
the personal conduct policy,

72
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,026
a player can be suspended

73
00:02:52,026 --> 00:02:54,760
even though there may
not be criminal charges

74
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,600
and the fact that Ezekiel
Elliot is meeting in person

75
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,430
with the Commissioner signals
to me that a suspension,

76
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,750
albeit one game, two games,
could be in play here

77
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,760
and he was sent to New York for a reason.

78
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,280
So, we'll see how it plays
out in the coming days

79
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,110
but his prior behavior will certainly

80
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,340
be a factor in their assessment.

81
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,110
- Well let's shift gears
to between the lines.

82
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,570
Victor, how important is the running game

83
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,720
to this current Dallas Cowboys team?

84
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,540
- It's huge, especially
Ezekiel Elliot, right?

85
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,280
He's been the focal point of that offense,

86
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,050
especially from the
running back perspective,

87
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,580
year in and year out.

88
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,070
Things he can do with
the ball in his hands

89
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,080
whether out in space or just
handing him the football

90
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,360
behind that fantastic offensive line.

91
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,090
I mean, he is in my opinion
the heartbeat of that offense.

92
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,810
Obviously Dak is the leader

93
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,510
but Ezekiel's the one that makes them go.

94
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,620
As he does well, then you
got the play-action pass

95
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,110
and everything compliments the
attributes of Ezekiel Elliot,

96
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,810
so, obviously if he's there to miss

97
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,790
any significant amount of time, you know,

98
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,961
the Cowboys would be
looking to replace that,

99
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:52,370
those statistics and those numbers

100
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,110
that he puts up week in and
week out in a different way.

101
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,460
- Yeah, and Vic you just
hit the nail on the head.

102
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,680
When you look Dak
Prescott, his pass rating

103
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,750
goes from 97 to 122 play-action compared

104
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,010
to traditional drop-back.

105
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,260
So you can see the importance
of the running game.

106
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,750
Ezekiel Elliot, obviously
opposing defenses

107
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,170
are focusing in on stopping Ezekiel Elliot

108
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,680
and that's a very impactful,
in terms of his impact

109
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,420
on Prescott's production
to go from 97 to 122.

110
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:23,330
That's a huge jump in terms of
his play-action productivity.

111
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,037
- Huge jump and we'll
talk about Dak's deal

112
00:04:25,037 --> 00:04:26,290
and when it may get done

113
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,080
but I'd be interested to
see how all of you feel

114
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,380
like this Dallas Cowboys team
stacks up in the division.

115
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,580
- I think they're right there at the top.

116
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,880
I think they're competing, obviously them

117
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,420
and Philadelphia are
right there neck and neck

118
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:38,360
and gonna be battling it
out throughout the season

119
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,520
but I think that they got all the tools.

120
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,970
When you look at them defensively

121
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,200
from the defensive line all
the way back to the secondary,

122
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,880
they're loaded at each position.

123
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,870
And then offensively like
we just talked about,

124
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,500
Dak Prescott, Ezekiel
Elliot, Martin Cooper,

125
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,060
Randall Cobb, Jason, I could
go on for days with this

126
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,746
but they have all of the talent.

127
00:04:53,746 --> 00:04:55,165
- [Mike] Receivers.

128
00:04:55,165 --> 00:04:55,998
- [Victor] Exactly.

129
00:04:55,998 --> 00:04:57,806
We got all of the talent,
and not to mention

130
00:04:57,806 --> 00:04:59,325
- [Wendy] They have a
new offense coordinator

131
00:04:59,325 --> 00:05:00,158
- [Victor] In Clamor obviously.

132
00:05:00,158 --> 00:05:02,330
Which obviously comes from college

133
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,270
and doing those different things.

134
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,640
So, he'll provide some creativity

135
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,190
that we probably haven't
seen and some different type

136
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:11,450
of plays that we haven't seen necessarily

137
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:12,830
from the Dallas Cowboys.

138
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:13,760
- You're not going with the Eagles,

139
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,490
you're going with the Dallas
Cowboys to win that division?

140
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,998
- Yes, unfortunately, nobody
in New York kill me please

141
00:05:17,998 --> 00:05:18,831
but I'm going with the Cowboys

142
00:05:18,831 --> 00:05:20,901
- Right, that was Victor.

143
00:05:20,901 --> 00:05:22,800
When does Dak's deal get done?

144
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,610
Do we see that done before
the start of the season?

145
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,660
- I think that deal will get
before the start of the season.

146
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,140
In fact, even just talking to people

147
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,580
in the Cowboys organization
about the timing of it.

148
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,970
It's funny 'cause just a few months ago

149
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,680
the way it was being explained to me

150
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,100
it was gonna be a while.

151
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,040
It wasn't gonna get done.

152
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,400
And now it seems that I'm not sure

153
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,834
where the pressure is coming from.

154
00:05:43,834 --> 00:05:45,480
I don't know why why they're
feeling the pressure.

155
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,000
But in terms of trying to get that done

156
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,220
it seems that that's gonna
be a priority for Dallas.

157
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,800
- You know the pressure really comes from

158
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,460
what Dak Prescott's
draft day disappoint was

159
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,270
is now becoming the reality
of a free agent opportunity

160
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,390
because he was not a first round pick.

161
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,600
Which was a disappointment.

162
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,030
But he's now in the final
year of his rookie contract.

163
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,930
So, unlike guys like Jared
Goff and Carson Wentz

164
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,740
who had the additional fifth year,

165
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,770
he could get to the market.

166
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,300
And he may not be a perfect player,

167
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,900
I'm a believer in Dak Prescott.

168
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,410
Not 'cause only what you do
from a passing standpoint

169
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,240
but the plays he makes with his legs.

170
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,980
If he made it to the open market

171
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,030
the way Kirk Hudson
did a couple years ago.

172
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,550
Hard to say what he could get

173
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,560
and I know people could say,

174
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,550
well, he could certainly get franchised.

175
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,540
But I could tell you from
an organization standpoint,

176
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,270
when you use the franchise tag,

177
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,960
the last position you wanna
use it on is the quarterback.

178
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,170
Because when you have a franchise tag

179
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,840
that means that the player
doesn't have to be there

180
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,200
for the off season program,

181
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,580
doesn't have to be
there for training camp.

182
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,020
He could come in the
Tuesday before opening day,

183
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,300
sign the tag, get paid
for the whole season

184
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,020
and it really puts the whole offense

185
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,140
and all those reps that you
don't have together Vic.

186
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,340
So, it's really a situation
where the sense of urgency Diana

187
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,100
in my mind it's coming from
the fact that this player

188
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,690
is 16 games away from
becoming a free agent.

189
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,330
- And then that quarterback
also feels that pressure.

190
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,630
I mean, and they don't ever
really feel like they belong.

191
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,050
Do you remember with the
Kirk Cousins situation

192
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,550
in Washington?

193
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,130
He was always out there proving
and proving and proving.

194
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:07,670
And I remember talking to him about it

195
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,500
and you could tell
- [Victor] It weighs on him

196
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,811
it was wearing on him

197
00:07:10,811 --> 00:07:13,100
because he was like the
Washington Redskins organization

198
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,940
they were just looking to
date, and date, and date.

199
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,020
And he was looking for a ring.

200
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,870
He wanted to get married and
he wanted to feel that love,

201
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,040
and he never did.

202
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,755
For the Cowboys to put that on Dak,

203
00:07:21,755 --> 00:07:24,140
that may not work out for them you know,

204
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,320
if they wanna make that work.

205
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,510
- You know what he's married to?

206
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,680
Money, a lot of money.

207
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,570
I am not crying for Kirk Cousins

208
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,240
but it is a point well made.

209
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,073
Alright, anyway.

210
00:07:33,073 --> 00:07:34,310
Circling back to where we started,

211
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,580
and that is the Gillette.

212
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,770
The Cowboys certainly hoping
that he will not miss any time.

213
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,430
A video shows Browns running back.

214
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,370
Kareem Hunt being questioned by police

215
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,850
after an apparent incident Saturday night.

216
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,970
This was at a Cleveland bar.

217
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,470
The video published by TMZ Sports.

218
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,810
It shows Hunt speaking
with a number of officers.

219
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:56,190
He was not arrested, they
did not make a police report

220
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,460
regarding the incident.

221
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:01,290
This is according to a
spokesperson to Cleveland.com.

222
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,500
Still to come on NFL Live,

223
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,360
Steeler star wide-receiver Smith-Schuster,

224
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,900
he of Juju, joins us from
across the pond in London.

225
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,770
Find out what he's been up
to during the off season.

226
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,900
And the story of high
school football coach

227
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,623
born with one of the rarest
conditions in the world.

228
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,930
- There's definitely doubters
out there, like parents,

229
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,210
look at him, my son is
getting coached at quarterback

230
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,070
from a guy that has no arms and no legs.

231
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,790
That lights a fire under my butt

232
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,890
and probably gets me
excited to really just try

233
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:31,533
to prove people wrong about it.

234
00:09:00,762 --> 00:09:05,595
- [Commentator] And another
golden moment from Wimbledon.

235
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:12,250

to which you would separate.

this isn't the only case.

240
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,903
Very little documentation.

241
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,240
I know that's not true.

242
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,353
And the shelter's really don't
know what to do with them.

243
00:09:24,353 --> 00:09:26,903
I just got another person
from DHS to confirm this.

and I get to be in this
Guy Cook commercial?

270
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,650
- Let's do the eyebrows first,

271
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,250

319
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,720
between the NFL and players association

320
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,550
are expected to intensify
this summer in an effort

321
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:52,880
to get a new deal done by
the start of the 2019 season.

322
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,070
Three to four negotiating
sessions possible

323
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:59,050
in the month of July alone.

324
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,290
Former Packers wide receiver Randall Cobb,

325
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,280
signed by the Cowboys and free agency,

326
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:07,450
teamed up with Aaron Rodgers
for over 5000 receiving yards.

327
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:10,420
After being drafted by the pack in 2011,

328
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,630
he will face his former
team in week five in Dallas.

329
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,400
And he had to say this

330
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,847
about moving on from Green Bay

331
00:13:17,847 --> 00:13:20,077
"It's like the ex-girlfriend
that broke up with you."

332
00:13:20,077 --> 00:13:22,027
"When you see her five years later,"

333
00:13:22,027 --> 00:13:24,907
"you hope you're in a better
situation than you were before"

334
00:13:24,907 --> 00:13:27,847
"married, with kids,
and you're able to say,"

335
00:13:27,847 --> 00:13:30,400
"yeah I did better without you."

336
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,980
You know what, he's right.

337
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,800
Nobody says that but
that's how everybody feels.

338
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,610
- But I don't think a breakup
has to be contentious.

339
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:36,930
- It doesn't matter, you know I don't care

340
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,420
if it's the best breakup
ever, you don't wanna be like,

341
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,513
oh life wasn't so great,
you're winning, I'm not.

342
00:13:41,513 --> 00:13:43,020
No, you wanna win sorry.

343
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,180
It just is what it is.

344
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:47,440
Okay, anyway, that got us
thinking five years from now

345
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,340
who's better off.

346
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:51,980
Okay, we've seen a number of
NFL breakups, if you will.

347
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,930
So, again, five year mark, Randall Cobb

348
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,900
or the Green Bay Packers,
who's better off?

349
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,990
- I'm going with Randall Cobb,

350
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,790
I think he's joining a team in the Cowboys

351
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,223
that's a younger team.

352
00:14:00,223 --> 00:14:03,790
I think they're an overall
better team right now

353
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,050
than the Green Bay Packers.

354
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:08,270
But I think in five years
he'll be in the playoffs

355
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:10,950
a couple times, he's obviously in the mix

356
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:11,920
of that wide receiving core,

357
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,020
he's gonna be a focal point
in that slot position.

358
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,610
That's an important
position nowadays in the NFL

359
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,670
and I think overall he'll just be better.

360
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,740
Dak Prescott's got a younger quarterback,

361
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,040
I think that'll serve him better

362
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,620
obviously giving that longevity

363
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,900
and be there for a couple years.

364
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,870
He can build that comradery
and that continuity with Dak

365
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,916
which will serve him
better five years from now.

366
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,840
- He's not gonna miss
Aaron Rodgers at all.

367
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,440
- They're a better overall team.

368
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:40,030
- (crosstalk drowns out speaker)

369
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,740
- All right listen, there
were no, in my opinion,

370
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,050
no more notable breakup than that one

371
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,630
between Odell Beckham Jr
and the New York Giants.

372
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,300
This one's easy if you talk about it now

373
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,290
but we're talking about
five years from now.

374
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,870
Diana who's better off?

375
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,870
- I'm gonna go with Odell Beckham Jr

376
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,810
is gonna be in a much better position.

377
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,347
Well first of all he got
paid, he got tons of money

378
00:14:58,347 --> 00:15:01,690
and he has opportunity to make more money.

379
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:05,450
Price of living in Cleveland
is lower, taxes are lower.

380
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:07,610
So, from a personal financial standpoint

381
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:10,390
Odell Beckham Jr is winning big time.

382
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:13,820
But when it comes to football,
there is no quarterback

383
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:17,610
that I believe has more potential
to be one of the greatest

384
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:20,830
than I believe in what
Baker Mayfield could do

385
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:23,710
in terms of the continuity and the team

386
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:24,820
that they're building in Cleveland

387
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,770
compared to what they're
doing in New York.

388
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:28,620
We're not sure what's gonna
happen to Pat Shurmur,

389
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,870
if he's gonna be there,
you have to feel like

390
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,340
he could be on the hot seat
this year if it doesn't work.

391
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,030
It seems that Cleveland
is a much better off space

392
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:36,990
for Odell Beckham Jr.

393
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,400
So I think he's gonna look back and go,

394
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,590
you know what, that was good.

395
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,423
- That was good.

396
00:15:40,423 --> 00:15:43,010
What's interesting is, the
Giants had a couple of breakups

397
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,690
also Landon Collins who's
better off in five years.

398
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:46,850
- I'm gonna go the other way here Diana,

399
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,655
I'm gonna go with the New York Giants,

400
00:15:48,655 --> 00:15:50,440
Dave Gettleman and that front office.

401
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,890
When we look at what they've already done

402
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,130
to replace Landon Collins,

403
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:56,010
they acquired Antoine
Bethea in free agency

404
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:58,160
and Jabrill Peppers that
was part of the trade

405
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,360
that sent Odell Beckham Jr to Cleveland.

406
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,970
And although Collins is a good player,

407
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,130
I thought he was more productive

408
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,560
closer to the line of scrummage.

409
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,600
When you look at the way Peppers plays

410
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,860
he could replace him, he's
younger, more athletic,

411
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,693
and less expensive.

412
00:16:10,693 --> 00:16:12,730
So, Wendy it's not five years.

413
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:15,160
We know right now we're
better off without Landin.

414
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:19,100
- Wow alright, fair enough, noted.

415
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,520
You know I said there
was no bigger breakup

416
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,353
but as soon as I said that

417
00:16:21,353 --> 00:16:23,293
I thought about AB and the Steelers.

418
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,340
I'm gonna retract that.

419
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,570
But anyway, Antonio
Brown and the Steelers.

420
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,140
This one I think is tricky cause again,

421
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:32,590
you're talking about five
seasons out who's better off.

422
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,790
- I'm going with the Steelers here.

423
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,840
I really feel like the Steelers
organization as a whole,

424
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,370
they're gonna be turned the page fully

425
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,610
from the Antonio Brown drama,

426
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:41,820
they're gonna be lookin' at Juju.

427
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,960
He's gonna be tenured,

428
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,940
he's gonna be a true
veteran leader on that team.

429
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:46,900
Understand who he is.

430
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,340
Big Ben, who knows how
many years he has left?

431
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,420
But with that body frame and
if he takes care of himself

432
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,030
he can still be there five years from now

433
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,370
playing at a high level.

434
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:55,800
But these guys are ready to play.

435
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,940
I think as a team, as a perspective,

436
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,150
once they get rid of the drama
and get rid of the negativity

437
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,780
that's around that was
surrounding the team

438
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,870
with Le'Veon Bell and all of these things.

439
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:06,397
I think five years from now,
this team will be better

440
00:17:06,397 --> 00:17:07,230
and Roethlisberger will be relaxed

441
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,410
and the team will be good to go.

442
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:10,390
- Alright, perfect segue,

443
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:13,030
how about Le'Veon Bell and
the Pittsburgh Steelers?

444
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,080
- Well I think we saw a little bit

445
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,810
of a sneak preview the last year right?

446
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,130
You know, Bell was a Steeler
- Not really.

447
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:19,050
- But he really wasn't,

448
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,380
so, we're gonna go with
the Pittsburgh Steelers

449
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,600
and obviously we're
talking about James Conner,

450
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,510
who filled in last year for Le'Veon Bell.

451
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,470
We have another year with him
now in the off season program

452
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,690
and I think really where
we're gonna miss Bell guys

453
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,580
isn't as a rusher but as a receiver.

454
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,170
But James Conner is a
really good running back,

455
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,870
he's productive between the tackles,

456
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,190
he's a good pass protector.

457
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,350
And again, another year
of growing into the job

458
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,160
I think Pittsburgh year in and year out

459
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,350
does a great job of letting guys move on.

460
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,650
I think the replacing
Bell, I agree with Victor

461
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:48,570
and I think they're gonna replace AB,

462
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:51,130
and I think they're gonna
replace Bell very well

463
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,010
with James Conner.

464
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,210
- Alright, I do think that team

465
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,510
has sort of rallied
around these departures.

466
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,760
That's now, we'll see where
they are in a few seasons.

467
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,255
This last one, I don't even think

468
00:17:59,255 --> 00:18:00,088
you can count it as a breakup.

469
00:18:00,088 --> 00:18:01,310
I'm not sure they even really dated.

470
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,967
I don't know, they went out.

471
00:18:02,967 --> 00:18:04,080
- It was a hookup.

472
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,262
- It was a hookup, Josh
Rosen and the Cardinals.

473
00:18:07,262 --> 00:18:09,640
- I think Josh Rosen
is gonna be better off.

474
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,460
Look, this kid had the weight
of the world on his shoulders.

475
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,310
He was a top draft pick, he
was supposed to be the savior,

476
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:19,520
the answer to the Arizona
Cardinals organization.

477
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,810
Of course, that didn't work
out so here he is in Miami now.

478
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,920
The pressure is really off.

479
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,900
He's got a new head coach here,

480
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,530
they're gonna be running
a new England system.

481
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,860
By the way, if you run the
new England offensive system

482
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,450
you've gotta be a smart guy.

483
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:33,850
That's what Josh Rosen is.

484
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:37,250
He's a smart guy and I think
he's gonna fit in well there

485
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,830
and it's gonna be a place.

486
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,620
And by the way, he also
had Fitzpatrick behind him

487
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,170
who doesn't really seems
to have the attitude

488
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:44,920
of a starter that doesn't want to help.

489
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,130
So, you have two smart
guys in a quarterback room,

490
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,730
it seems like that's a much better place

491
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,000
for Josh Rosen to flourish.

492
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,477
- But Diana, what about Kyler Murray,

493
00:18:51,477 --> 00:18:53,140
you don't think Arizona with Kyler Murray

494
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:57,130
has a chance to be a dynamic
play maker five years from now?

495
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:59,170
- That's really what
this question is right.

496
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,800
Is an assessment of Kyler
Murray in a lot of ways.

497
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,670
- No it definitely is.

498
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,190
Again, the big question mark of course

499
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,820
is is it gonna work with Kliff Kingsbury.

500
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,980
But to me, my biggest issue with Arizona,

501
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,040
is last year and this year
is their offensive line.

502
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,920
So, as much as we can
say Kyler Murray can--

503
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,920
- I've got five years to fix it (laughter)

504
00:19:20,294 --> 00:19:21,127
- Try'na get rid of me?

505
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:22,269
We got five years I'm just--

506
00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:23,260
- Breaking up is hard to do.

507
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,220
- You gave us five years right?

508
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,480
- I gave you five years I did
- That's a lot of drafts.

509
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,630
- Fair enough.

510
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:30,390
Alright, when we come
back Juju Smith-Schuster

511
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:33,480
isn't thinking five years,
he's thinking right now.

512

Of course you don't because you didn't.

519
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:10,940
Your job isn't understanding tax code,

520

it's understanding why that
will get him a body like that.

Or to carry on a legacy?

James Conner yesterday,

632
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,760
he talked about turning
the page about the changes

633
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,760
that had gone on in Pittsburgh
during the off season.

634
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,560
What's the temperature of this team

635
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,313
as you get ready for training camp?

636
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,190
- We're out in the 70, we're not too cold

637
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,040
or we're not too hot,

638
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,540
so, the weather is really nice right now.

639
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,515
In our locker room everyone
is on the same page you know.

640
00:25:28,515 --> 00:25:29,600
Focusing on the same goal.

641
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,693
Which is amazing, because
that's what we're all about.

642
00:25:31,693 --> 00:25:33,540
Is we're all about the
team, there's no individuals

643
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,610
and we're here to win games
and win championships.

644
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:37,090
- Juju talk to me about some of the talent

645
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:38,244
you're seeing out there in London behind.

646
00:25:38,244 --> 00:25:39,530
Are there an Ballers out there,

647
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:41,430
any future Steelers out there or what?

648
00:25:43,488 --> 00:25:45,760
- Oh man, there's some talent
out here, some potential.

649
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,400
I mean, you gotta understand,
this game is new to them.

650
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,100
You know, we started
lifting weights at 14,

651
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,330
these guys are barely starting at 16, 17.

652
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:54,850
So if we were to get
them on the right page

653
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:57,720
on to the academy, that
would be amazing to

654
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,880
start a team.

655
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,510
Eventually start their
middle school, high school,

656
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,720
and that would be their academy.

657
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,040
- Alright Juju it's been well documented

658
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,920
that Antonio Brown is no
longer with the Steelers,

659
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,710
now you're the number one guy.

660
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:10,543
How does it feel?

661
00:26:10,543 --> 00:26:12,010
Do you feel a difference
in the locker room?

662
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:13,170
Are people treating you differently?

663
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:15,260
Are dudes getting your
lunch trays for you,

664
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,680
like is it a different feeling
being the number one guy?

665
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,530
How does it feel?

666
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:23,784
- Nah man there's no difference.

667
00:26:23,784 --> 00:26:25,580
I mean all the people used to say,

668
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,755
you're the number one guy this year

669
00:26:26,755 --> 00:26:29,027
but more for myself man I
just see it more opportunity

670
00:26:29,027 --> 00:26:31,760
for not just myself but
for other guys to step up.

671
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,640
You're talking about AB

672
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,580
having a hundred catches
over a thousand yards.

673
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,540
Those yards, those catches
are gonna be spread out

674
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,620
you know obviously between
James Conner, Vance McDonald,

675
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,888
and James Washington, Donte Moncrief,

676
00:26:40,888 --> 00:26:43,660
a lot of guys, James Samuels.

677
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,510
There are so many guys who
are gonna get more touches,

678
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:47,730
more catches, more yards, more yak.

679
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,300
You know, just to help them individually.

680
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:52,091
But at the end of the day
I'm still the same dude,

681
00:26:52,091 --> 00:26:56,460
same Juju, same person, I'm
just last year I was 21,

682
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,521
this year I'm 22, same thing.

683
00:26:58,521 --> 00:26:59,354
- [Victor] That's what's up.

684
00:26:59,354 --> 00:27:02,010
- [Wendy] The 22 year old
version of Juju Smith-Schuster,

685
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:04,710
Juju you reference the
football being spread around,

686
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:07,580
that makes the communication
with Ben Roethlisberger

687
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,000
all that more important.

688
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,600
What's your relationship
like with your quarterback?

689
00:27:13,557 --> 00:27:15,480
- It's amazing man, you know what I mean,

690
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,480
Ben he's a great leader, great dude,

691
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,310
he's taken the whole offensive group

692
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:23,380
down to his lake house in Georgia.

693
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,750
Amazing, we spent time together bonding,

694
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:28,340
we worked hard, we threw
but at the end of the day

695
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,800
it's more so like building
that bond and that connection

696
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,390
and what he did for us was amazing.

697
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:34,440
I think it's so crazy that a guy

698
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,500
who's been in the league
for like 15, 16 years

699
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,550
he sees so many guys come and go

700
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:41,470
and you know for me I'm only 22 years old,

701
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:43,280
when I met him I was 20 years old

702
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,010
and our bond is just gonna keep growing.

703
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,020
- I know as a athlete,

704
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,690
as a super star athlete that you are

705
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:49,980
you're always working on something new.

706
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,600
You're always working on something
new to perfect your game.

707
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,260
Give me one thing you've been
working on this off season

708
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,750
to just either get better at
or something you wanna add

709
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,850
to your game, or whatever the case may be.

710
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,300
- Man I've been really
really focusing in playing

711
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,300
more inside and outside and
learning the whole package.

712
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,780
Learning the whole offense,

713
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,990
that's what separates being
on the field the whole game

714
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:12,610
than being on the field
certain plays during packages.

715
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:15,540
I think it's great that I'm
able to play outside, inside,

716
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:19,470
right side, left side, inside in.

717
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:21,170
That's gonna help out a lot,

718
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:23,063
that's something I've
really been focused on,

719
00:28:23,063 --> 00:28:25,710
it's just studying that
playbook till the next level

720
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:28,490
and understanding what
everybody has on the field.

721
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:29,570
- Juju we also get to see

722
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:31,440
everything else you do via social media.

723
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,453
Does anybody in the NFL
have more fun than you do?

724
00:28:37,554 --> 00:28:41,810
- Not necessarily, I mean
I do lots of YouTube stuff

725
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:44,226
there's a lot of stuff I do on that end.

726
00:28:44,226 --> 00:28:46,887
I really love to show my personal side.

727
00:28:46,887 --> 00:28:48,960
You know, my fun side,
what I do in my free time,

728
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,440
you know playing Fortnite.

729
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,570
I do a lot of video-game
streaming, Twitch,

730
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:53,900
and making YouTube videos.

731
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,630
I think a lot of guys in the NFL

732
00:28:56,630 --> 00:29:00,020
they just post a lot
of working out videos,

733
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,070
which is nothing wrong with that

734
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,983
but what do they like to
do on their free time?

735
00:29:02,983 --> 00:29:04,630
Do they like to travel the world?

736
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:06,930
Do they like to just
stay home watch movies?

737
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:09,233
I think a lot of their
fans would love to see that

738
00:29:09,233 --> 00:29:10,747
on a more personal base.

739
00:29:10,747 --> 00:29:13,690
- Well, and some like
to go to prom you know.

740
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:15,460
Which apparently you did recently.

741
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,883
Tell us about the prom.

742
00:29:19,186 --> 00:29:20,020
- So the prom was awesome, you know.

743
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:22,560
A kid, he's from PA Pittsburgh.

744
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:27,320
Ideally he wanted to take
this girl that he liked a lot

745
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,560
and his best friend ends up taking her.

746
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,540
He told his best friend
too but his best friend

747
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,410
kind of went behind his
back, took his girl.

748
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:36,390
So he asked me and I was just like, man

749
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:37,780
let's just one-up this kid.

750
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,610
We buy a suit, we get a party bus,

751
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:43,520
we basically stole the night
away from him and his girl

752
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:48,670
but at the end of the day
we all had a good time.

753
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:53,210
I met the guy, he seems like
a good kid, so he's great.

754
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:54,043
My friend is great

755
00:29:54,043 --> 00:29:56,590
'cause he got like 20k followers, Anthony.

756
00:29:56,590 --> 00:30:00,207
So he's super excited about
his college career coming.

757
00:30:00,207 --> 00:30:05,207
- Anthony one, friend and
girlfriend nothing, he wins.

758
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:08,040
- Juju we saw you getting
busy on the dance floor.

759
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,610
We saw you getting busy on
the dance floor right there.

760
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:12,320
Talk to me about what
celebrations you got in store.

761
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,220
I know you're always being creative,

762
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,050
you always bring some
new stuff to the table.

763
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:16,230
What you got in store for us this year

764
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,093
from the celebration standpoint?

765
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,534
Man so look, I'm super excited.

766
00:30:21,534 --> 00:30:24,706
Yes, I'm a young dude in
a room but I'm very vocal,

767
00:30:24,706 --> 00:30:27,140
it's my time to step up, to be a leader

768
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:30,350
and what I mean by leader, I'm
getting everybody on the page

769
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:32,990
to do major celebration Marlon McCree,

770
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:35,030
he's older than me but he's
gonna do these celebrations.

771
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,120
James Washington.

772
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,920
All these guys, major celebration.

773
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,840
James Washington's on the same page

774
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,673
because we're in the same class.

775
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:45,620
And then I'm still working
on Big Ben and Alejandro.

776
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,950
They're a lot older than me
so they've been there before

777
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,690
so we'll see how it all figures out.

778
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:52,290
But major celebrations coming soon.

779
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:53,260
- All right, we can't wait.

780
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,690
Last question, we asked
James Conner this yesterday

781
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:58,310
to close things out,
why should Steeler fans

782
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:01,483
be optimistic as we look toward 2019?

783
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:07,670
- Man Steeler fans they're
always here supporting

784
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:10,272
since day one whether
we're doing good or bad,

785
00:31:10,272 --> 00:31:12,858
I don't doubt those supporters to the end.

786
00:31:12,858 --> 00:31:15,730
I'm kind of happy where
we're at right now,

787
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:18,580
we're not the headline, the Browns,

788
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,033
the team that everyone is watching

789
00:31:20,033 --> 00:31:21,720
what kind of noise they're gonna make.

790
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,821
I'm super excited to watch them play too.

791
00:31:23,821 --> 00:31:27,230
Seeing OBJ comment on my post
and I'm commenting on his post

792
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:29,650
like, yo we can't wait who's
gonna have the best dance moves

793
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:32,440
but like I said this year
the fans just support

794
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,220
until the end because
we're gonna finish strong.

795
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,310
You always notice we always pull through.

796
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,620
- [Wendy] Alright Juju, best of luck.

797
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,890
We appreciate you being with us.

798
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:40,893
- [Victor] Thanks for being with us Ju.

799
00:31:42,004 --> 00:31:43,353
- Thank you, I appreciate it.

800
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:47,210
- [Wendy] With Antonio Brown
now departed to Oakland,

801
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:49,820
Juju will become Big
Ben's number one option

802
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:52,920
and he should receive tighter coverage.

803
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,060
Over the last two seasons
been facing press covers.

804
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,530
Juju actually though
had a better catch rate

805
00:31:57,530 --> 00:32:01,340
and yards for target than Antonio Brown.

806
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:05,470
Clearly Victor perspective changes

807
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:06,700
a little bit I would think.

808
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:10,160
You know he's the number one
guy, he can say whatever.

809
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,470
What kind of pressure?

810
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:14,180
How is it different for
Juju starting this season

811
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,013
than say last year?

812
00:32:15,013 --> 00:32:16,980
- I think the only thing
different is like you said,

813
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,270
the mindset, the perspective,

814
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,960
obviously you're coming
into that locker room

815
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,020
and Antonio Brown is
not there, it's just you

816
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,180
and now you become kind of that leader.

817
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,899
People are looking to you.

818
00:32:25,899 --> 00:32:26,810
You've been there, you
understand who you are.

819
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:29,030
I know you're just 22 years old

820
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:32,230
but now you become the guy
that the younger teammates

821
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:33,590
are looking up to you

822
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:35,000
wanting to know what you're doing,

823
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,440
wanting to hang out with
you in the off season.

824
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,130
Wanting to just steal a little
bit of knowledge from you.

825
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:40,560
Your relationship with Ben.

826
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,810
They wanna get a headstart

827
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:43,460
on what they need to do to get better

828
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:47,670
and he becomes the guy that
leads the charge in that regard

829
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:49,360
and it's pretty big shoes to fill.

830
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,770
And I think the Steelers
have done a great job.

831
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:53,650
I think they were preparing
for this for a number of years.

832
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:56,290
And there is that whole notion
of we have to win for today

833
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:57,670
and develop for tomorrow.

834
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:59,510
And you look at that
position in that organization

835
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:03,646
going back to Mike
Wallace, Santonio Holmes,

836
00:33:03,646 --> 00:33:06,240
obviously Antonio Brown, Smith-Schuster.

837
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,860
They do a great job of
getting guys in the pipeline,

838
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:09,850
getting them developed.

839
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:12,230
And now Antonio Brown moves on,

840
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:14,220
Smith-Schuster steps up
to be the number one guy.

841
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,650
I think they've done
a remarkably great job

842
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:17,670
for a number of years.

843
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:18,660
Especially at this position.

844
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,170
- I Think that's a great
point, and I would argue

845
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:21,120
that outside of New England,

846
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,610
they probably do it as well as anybody

847
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:23,600
in terms of continuity.

848
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,100
I know Antonio Brown ended in a way

849
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,500
they probably didn't anticipate
but they did anticipate

850
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,070
that it would end at some point.

851
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,950
And to that end, and
Mike to you your point,

852
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:33,740
they seemed to be sort of in lockstep

853
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,080
for planning for the future.

854
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,380
- I think there's three things
that Juju Smith-Schuster

855
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,560
has to probably focus on this season.

856
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,330
It's going from being a great
receiver to an elite receiver.

857
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:44,196
He needs to play at that level.

858
00:33:44,196 --> 00:33:46,590
Victor touched on the leadership aspect.

859
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,940
It's obvious just from that interview

860
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:50,360
you can hear he has stepped
up to already be the leader.

861
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,120
He's talkin' 'bout trying to get Big Ben

862
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,010
in the offensive line

863
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:55,320
to participate in his celebration drills.

864
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,280
And they obviously have
good chemistry there.

865
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,860
And then that third
layer is being a mentor

866
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,110
to those younger guys.

867
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:03,900
So he's gonna be asked a lot more of him

868
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,387
as a football player out on the field

869
00:34:05,387 --> 00:34:08,070
and of course in the locker
room, but if there's one thing

870
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:10,640
I think we've learned
about Juju over the years

871
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,600
is he attacks everything with open arms.

872
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,160
He is an open book himself,
he embraces that role

873
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:20,070
and he wants to be that character guy.

874
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:21,330
He wants to be that good guy.

875
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:23,120
And when you talk to
players on the Steelers

876
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,480
about Juju Smith and what
his personality is like

877
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,780
because obviously on social
media he's so much fun

878
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,130
and he can be loud,

879
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:31,420
apparently he does a lot
of his work silently.

880
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,190
He's not the loudest guy in the room,

881
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:35,930
he's not the one joking
around during drills.

882
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:38,720
He likes to have fun but
he is locked in and focused

883
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,300
and I think if he can take
his game to that elite level

884
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,560
the Antonio Brown conversations
that we're gonna be having

885
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,960
are gonna feel so long ago.

886
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,840
- You know what else he said

887
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,250
that was really impressive
in the interview,

888
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:49,660
he touched on at the end about

889
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,140
the Steelers are always there in the end.

890
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,820
And it's not where you start in football,

891
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,160
it's where you end.

892
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,640
And you look at Pittsburgh
and New England,

893
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,820
those teams always improve

894
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,850
during the course of the season.

895
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:00,610
So, James Conner,
Smith-Schuster in a new role.

896
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:03,220
It's not what they look
like August or September.

897
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,360
Are they ascending and getting better

898
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,120
and Mike Tomlin deserves so much credit.

899
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,460
The player development, the
way they couch their players.

900
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:12,070
They get better and I thought
his point was a good one

901
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:14,030
which is, hey, we'll be there in the end

902
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:16,220
because that's where they've
been year in and year out.

903
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,940
- It almost feels like they transform

904
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:20,760
and they kinda morph into
whatever they need to be to win

905
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,460
towards the second half of the season

906
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,568
and that's what keeps them in
the hunt year in and year out.

907
00:35:24,568 --> 00:35:25,890
- Well, and I understand
for all kinda reasons

908
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,100
why everybody's looking to Cleveland.

909
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,610
But I think you'd unwise
to sleep on Pittsburgh

910
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:30,790
in any way, shape, or form.

911
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:33,320
Mike Tomlin as the head
coach, a veteran squad.

912
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,850
This is a good team.

913
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:37,170
I think that you could argue
underachieved last season.

914
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,300
We'll see.

915
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,569
What do Patrick Mahomes, Sequon Barkley

916
00:35:39,569 --> 00:35:42,610
and Kyler Murray all have in common?

917
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:46,090
They make head turning,
highlight real worthy plays.

918
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:48,613
We'll crown the highlight king next.

919
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:53,850
- You ever watch like the
highlights on YouTube?

920
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:55,430
- [Commentator] Patrick Mahomes on fire.

921
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:58,004
- [Commentator] Looks one
way, zings in another.

922
00:35:58,004 --> 00:35:59,776
- [Commentator] There you go!

923
00:35:59,776 --> 00:36:01,305
- [Commentator] Fly's over the top, flips

924
00:36:01,305 --> 00:36:03,385
and goes around, touch down.

925
00:36:03,385 --> 00:36:05,410
- [Commentator] Kyler
Murray an absolute dime!

926
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:08,020
- [Commentator] He's the best
quarterback you'll ever see

927
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:10,440
at everything else except height.

928
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,840
- [Commentator] Patrick
Mahomes with Mahomes magic.

929
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,667
How did he pull that off!?

930
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:20,450
- [Narrator] If only
there was a place nearby

931
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:23,823
you can get one of these or these.

932
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,680
Good thing they're sold
everywhere business is done.

933
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,180
I'm pretty sure you
can buy them at a bank.

934
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:33,814
Not sorry, Reese's.

935
00:36:33,814 --> 00:36:36,397

00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,150
- [Wendy] Let's take a
look at a few NFL players

1044
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:25,720
nominated for the ESPYS shall we?

1045
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,720
- After an impressive
sophomore running through

1046
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:32,720
for over 5000 yards and 50
touch downs and won an MVP.

1047
00:41:33,301 --> 00:41:37,810
Patrick Mahomes nominated
for best male athlete.

1048
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:42,350
Sequon Barkley nominated for
the best breakthrough athlete.

1049
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:44,360
Last season Barkley burst out of the scene

1050
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:47,440
rushing for 1307 yards.

1051
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,490
Broke a giant record.

1052
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:51,810
Kyler Murray nominated
for best college athlete.

1053
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:53,343
He became the seventh

1054
00:41:53,343 --> 00:41:57,210
to win the highest man in OU's history.

1055
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:59,580
None of those are too shabby alright?

1056
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:02,700
Today we give out the
Highlight King award.

1057
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,170
Is that in ESPY or it's not?

1058
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:05,696
- It is not but--
- Could be

1059
00:42:05,696 --> 00:42:06,529
- It should be.

1060
00:42:06,529 --> 00:42:07,362
- It should be.

1061
00:42:07,362 --> 00:42:08,580
- It definitely should be but it's funny

1062
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:11,770
because my choice is
Kansas city quarterback

1063
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:12,603
Patrick Mahomes.

1064
00:42:12,603 --> 00:42:14,577
He is up for male athlete of the year

1065
00:42:14,577 --> 00:42:15,850
- But you're crowning
him the Highlight King.

1066
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:17,620
- He's getting my vote, and here's why.

1067
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,540
Against the Ravens, facing fourth and nine

1068
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:20,850
from the chiefs forward,

1069
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:24,937
Mahomes just did what we had
seen him do countless times.

1070
00:42:24,937 --> 00:42:26,420
Which was buy time with his feet.

1071
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,470
- [Mike] Get outta bounds.

1072
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:31,500
Relies on his right hand there,
finds Tyreek Hill down field

1073
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,470
and the best part is after
the game Andy Reid said,

1074
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:34,820
oh yeah that's exact how you decided.

1075
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,120
Yeah, sure Andy.

1076
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,923
How about against the Broncos?

1077
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,660
We knew his right hand was magical.

1078
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,020
Did you just say lucky?

1079
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:42,853
- [Narrator] Leftie.

1080
00:42:42,853 --> 00:42:43,991
- Oh I thought you said lucky, I was like,

1081
00:42:43,991 --> 00:42:45,770
I don't think that was luck right?

1082
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:47,700
We knew his right hand was pretty magical

1083
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,033
but his left hand here.

1084
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:52,090
Spots Von Miller comin right at him.

1085
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:52,923
- [Mike] Semi-spiral on that.

1086
00:42:52,923 --> 00:42:54,930
- [Diana] Even when you're defense

1087
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:57,690
is doing everything they should be doing.

1088
00:42:57,690 --> 00:43:01,311
There are situations where
you cannot beat Pat Mahomes

1089
00:43:01,311 --> 00:43:04,720
because he comes up with some
unthinkable moments here.

1090
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,739
His athleticism, his vision of the field,

1091
00:43:07,739 --> 00:43:10,790
and his ability to stay
in the pocket plays

1092
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:12,490
and of course outside the pocket

1093
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:15,300
is where his perhaps
probably most dangerous.

1094
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,110
- Alright I'm going with
Sequon Barkley here.

1095
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:19,330
- [Wendy] Oh wait, he's your
Highlight King just to be clear

1096
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:21,360
- He is my Highlight King Sequon Barkley

1097
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,530
because he is a highlight machine

1098
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:27,260
as you can see he's
broken at least 47 tackles

1099
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:28,810
on that one to get to the end zone.

1100
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:31,060
In this one I mean, he's just
putting his foot in the ground

1101
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:32,960
he will not be denied against Philadelphia

1102
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,580
obviously a rivalry in that division.

1103
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:37,790
And he's taken off on that one.

1104
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:41,280
In this one, this one's pretty good.

1105
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,250
Okay we know this guy is good.

1106
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:44,310
First of all tremendous
block by 73 right there

1107
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:46,470
but this run is just indicative

1108
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:48,920
of the type of athlete
that Sequon Barkley is.

1109
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,870
He can shake guys behind
him, in front of him,

1110
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:53,640
and he's got the speed to
outrun anybody in this league.

1111
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,030
And that's what we see here.

1112
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:56,130
And it's always on display.

1113
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:57,330
And then I get a bonus Diana,

1114
00:43:57,330 --> 00:43:59,187
I get a bonus here like this one.

1115
00:43:59,187 --> 00:44:00,330
That's a little hurdle,

1116
00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:02,680
how many runner backs are doing that?

1117
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:05,830
Not only a handful of guys
I can probably count 'em all

1118
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:07,260
on one hand who can hurdle guys

1119
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:10,238
in traffic like that and keep it moving.

1120
00:44:10,238 --> 00:44:12,127
- (crosstalk drowns out speaker)

1121
00:44:12,127 --> 00:44:15,160
- Protection two he was able
to, not to pile on your Giants.

1122
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,300
But the fact that he was able

1123
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:18,585
to do that with that
old Lion is incredible.

1124
00:44:18,585 --> 00:44:20,078
- [Wendy] Mike Tannenbaum.

1125
00:44:20,078 --> 00:44:21,370
- I got Kyler Murray, I was at this game,

1126
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:23,150
his resiliency was unbelievable,

1127
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:26,090
they got outplayed
badly in the first half.

1128
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:28,770
He comes down in the second
half, he steps up with the Pak

1129
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:30,614
he keeps his eyes down on the field,

1130
00:44:30,614 --> 00:44:32,760
that puts so much pressure on a defense.

1131
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:35,000
Throws a really accurate pass.

1132
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,010
This was a great play.

1133
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:37,770
Got Oklahoma back in the game.

1134
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:40,650
This was another game I was
at, West Virginia's defense

1135
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:42,210
was horrific in this game.

1136
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:44,180
If they were playing flag football,

1137
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:46,910
Tyler Murray still
would've gone untouched.

1138
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:49,270
- [Victor] Looks like flag football.

1139
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:50,980
- And this is what Arizona was hoping for.

1140
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:53,460
Look at how many guys he
can make miss in space

1141
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,540
and then have the speed
to take it all the way.

1142
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:57,330
The amount of pressure
he'll put on defenses

1143
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:59,440
will be formidable in the fall

1144
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,610
because it'll be his arm and his feet.

1145
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:03,130
Speaking of his arm, look at this one.

1146
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:05,690
Oklahoma state big rivalry game.

1147
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:09,790
Again, 50 yards out in
the field Brown in stride.

1148
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,620
This guy's gonna be a dynamic play maker.

1149
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:14,700
He is a highlight machine, he
is the Highlight King maker

1150
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:17,130
and Arizona Cardinals fans,

1151
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:18,420
that's what they're looking
forward to in the fall.

1152
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:19,990
- They're hoping, fingers crossed.

1153
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:21,700
Listen, we told you we'd like to vote.

1154
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:22,540
We narrowed the field.

1155
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:25,720
It's one of these three
Highlight King okay.

1156
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,570
So go to out Twitter handle @ESPNNFL,

1157
00:45:28,802 --> 00:45:30,500

Diana you already voted.

1163
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:50,000
- [Wendy] A man born without
arms or legs found his calling

1164
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,593
coaching high school football.

1165
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:55,680
- He comes out full head of
hair parted down the side,

1166
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,013
I told him, there's
nothing ugly about him.

1167
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:03,033
He's still an angel.

1168
00:46:13,717 --> 00:46:17,150
- What's up DK, I know
you're asking yourself,

1169
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:18,193
am I worth the hype?

1170
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:22,680
Can I live up to it all?

1171
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,920
See that's the thing about hype,

1172
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,810
it can make you or break you.

1173
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:29,460
Here's what I've learned.

but only you get to answer.

1176

00:47:27,590 --> 00:47:28,850

about buying a new house.

1193

- Is it that obvious?

1194
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:33,740
- Yes it is.

1195
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:35,430
Or maybe you'd worry less if you GEICO

1197
00:47:37,490 --> 00:47:39,980
- I didn't know GEICO helps
with home owners insurance.

1198
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:41,980
- Yeah, they've been doing it for years.

00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,390

the dominant power

1212
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:20,810
of this man may end the dynasty.

1213
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:21,880
- We were pushing each other to limits

1214
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:25,120
that neither one of us
thought we were gonna go to.

1215
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,560
- We had a great rivalry.

1216
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:27,770
- [Narrator] What if I told you

1217
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:31,080
there was even more
beef behind the scenes.

1218

00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,670
Mendez found his calling coaching a sport

1254
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:43,140
that he was never able to play himself.

1255
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:44,530
- Essy( featured chronicles,

1256
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:47,270
Mendez's first season as
a head football coach.

1257
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:50,070
Capturing the inspiring and unlikely story

1258
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:53,130
of a coach who transformed
a group of young athletes

1259
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:55,323
from skeptics into believers.

1260
00:51:00,973 --> 00:51:03,390
(slow music)

1261
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,520
- [Coach] At this time I
just wanna introduce to you

1262
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,900
somebody that I think can really help

1263
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:16,150
turn this program around.

1264
00:51:19,191 --> 00:51:21,810
A coach that I hired cause I was impressed

1265
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:23,360
with his knowledge of the game.

1266
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:28,113
His passion as a coach blew me away.

1267
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:32,450
Everything else that's on top of that,

1268
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:33,930
in terms of who he is and what he does

1269
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:35,380
on a day to day basis,

1270
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:36,213
inspires me.

1271
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:40,673
Your new coach, Rob Mendez.

1272
00:51:49,081 --> 00:51:51,498
(deep music)

1273
00:52:07,990 --> 00:52:11,283
- It was awful, it was
really really awful.

1274
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:14,939
I didn't have a choice to have an abortion

1275
00:52:14,939 --> 00:52:19,207
so, I had to keep Robert.

1276
00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:23,653
- In the back of mind
I'm asking, why my son?

1277
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:28,763
You know, less than 100
born like him in the world.

1278
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:31,283
What am I gonna do with this boy.

1279
00:52:33,127 --> 00:52:33,960
- It was hard to see him.

1280
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,910
I really didn't wanna see Robert.

1281
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:39,010
So I didn't see little
Robert for about two weeks

1282
00:52:39,010 --> 00:52:41,703
because I didn't know what to do.

1283
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:46,460
- I just remember staring,

1284
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:48,190
you know there was a lot of staring.

1285
00:52:48,190 --> 00:52:50,133
It would piss me off really bad.

1286
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:54,453
Like he was not a human or something.

1287
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,207
- But he is different,

1288
00:53:05,091 --> 00:53:08,893
he sees people staring as an opportunity.

1289
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:18,920
- Things that you an I
get to do in ten minutes

1290
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:22,393
might take him an hour but
he never complained about it.

1291
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:29,540
- Robert was just a really easy child

1292
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:33,323
and he just was really really happy.

1293
00:53:35,890 --> 00:53:37,480
- What's your favorite team?

1294
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,117
San Francisco 49ers.

1295
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:44,803
- He's got a gift that doesn't
require him to be physical.

1296
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:47,133
Making him aware of that,

1297
00:53:48,997 --> 00:53:50,583
I think he just took the ball and ran.

1298
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,800
- I think the most difficult part

1299
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,650
about having no arms and no legs

1300
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:07,650
is simply not being able to play sports.

1301
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,230
I don't show it, I'm good at
not showing it but I get mad.

1302
00:54:12,633 --> 00:54:14,432
I get mad at God, I get mad at the Lord.

1303
00:54:14,432 --> 00:54:15,713
Like why?

1304
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:21,500
- His freshman year, he was
standing behind the fence

1305
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,300
at a distance watching the practice.

1306
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:25,780
That was the beginning.

1307
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,810
- We wanted to get him
involved in the program

1308
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:31,453
so we invited him to be our manager.

1309
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:33,870
- They didn't know what I could do,

1310
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:36,510
they obviously knew I couldn't
play but just to include me,

1311
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:37,940
it made me feel a part of it.

1312
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:41,083
You know, it made me feel, I
guess you could say normal.

1313
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:45,300
- He paid attention to us as coaches

1314
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:48,510
but he learned the game
playing Madden football.

1315
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:50,690
He created game plans on Madden

1316
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:53,200
and then he'd come to
practice and try to create

1317
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,580
the same game plans and
execute them the same way.

1318
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:58,670
- I started giving Robert a
little bit more responsibility

1319
00:54:58,670 --> 00:54:59,720
with my quarterbacks.

1320
00:55:03,507 --> 00:55:04,340
And the next thing you know

1321
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:05,820
he was there running the drills for us.

1322
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:12,010
His ability to study the game

1323
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:14,760
and his ability to translate
those things to the kids

1324
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:17,160
is unmatched by most of
the coaches that I know.

1325
00:55:28,617 --> 00:55:29,630
- I've been overlooked,

1326
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:32,233
the last three or four years
I've been ready for it.

1327
00:55:41,904 --> 00:55:45,530
When I go to a job interview
sometimes I feel like I'm gonna

1328
00:55:45,530 --> 00:55:49,819
scaring is not the right
word, surprise them.

1329
00:55:49,819 --> 00:55:52,640
And I don't know how they're
gonna take the surprise.

1330
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:56,210
- As he rolls out, to be
brutally honest, when I saw that

1331
00:55:56,210 --> 00:55:57,810
I'm like how can this guy coach?

1332
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:01,160
And as he comes close he
goes, give me a fist pump,

1333
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,660
give me a fist pump.

1334
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:03,730
I just gave him a little fist pump

1335
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:04,920
right there on his shoulder

1336
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:08,700
and all that nerves that
I had just melted away.

1337
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:11,730
We had other applicants
but I knew in my heart

1338
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:14,430
that it would be a great fit
for these young athletes.

1339
00:56:16,530 --> 00:56:18,400
- I remember when coach Kibble hired me,

1340
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:23,400
cruising off the campus I
just felt really accomplished

1341
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,620
'cause it took me so long I
knew I've been ready for it

1342
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:28,650
and I've been overlooked.

1343
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:30,300
And finally somebody
gave me the opportunity

1344
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:31,763
so I really appreciated that.

1345
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:37,640
- At this time I just
wanna introduce to you

1346
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:40,770
your new JBL coach Rob Mendez.

1347
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:43,020
(applause)

1348
00:56:44,090 --> 00:56:46,330
- Appreciate that coach Kibble

1349
00:56:46,330 --> 00:56:47,630
Thank you coach.

1350
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:48,820
You know football is my passion,

1351
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:50,530
this is gonna be my 13th year coaching

1352
00:56:50,530 --> 00:56:53,166
and I can't wait to get to
know every single one of you.

1353
00:56:53,166 --> 00:56:56,328
Believe in yourself,
believe in your teammates,

1354
00:56:56,328 --> 00:56:58,131
and believe in what you're doing.

1355
00:56:58,131 --> 00:57:00,063
Are we clear gentlemen?

1356
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:02,183
I'm excited guys.

1357
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:11,160
- Obviously it was a little shocking

1358
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,860
and there was jokes coming around.

1359
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:17,400
Typical teenagers you know
a guy with no arms or legs,

1360
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,150
not a lot of people have seen that.

1361
00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:24,070
If you're taken aback that's
just natural and that's human.

1362
00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:29,050
But after the first two
seconds, it's just a normal guy.

1363
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:30,580
- I don't care how good you are,

1364
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:32,500
I don't care how experienced you are,

1365
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:34,780
you guys are gonna do
everything as a team.

1366
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:36,540
- Though he may not look like a coach,

1367
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:38,926
he definitely acts like one.

1368
00:57:38,926 --> 00:57:42,470
- 9, 157, so what we're
gonna teach right now

1369
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:45,060
is called 31 zone.

1370
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:45,950
- His knowledge of the game

1371
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:48,710
for somebody who actually
hasn't gone through it

1372
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:50,290
is impressive.

1373
00:57:50,290 --> 00:57:52,700
On his phone he can diagram a play faster

1374
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:55,000
than I can do it with pen and paper.

1375
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,580
- There's definitely doubters
out there like parents.

1376
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:59,100
Look at him, my son is getting coached

1377
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,613
at quarterback by a guy who
has no arms and no legs.

1378
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,590
That lights a fire under my butt

1379
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:06,750
and probably gets me excited

1380
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:09,590
to really just try to prove
people wrong about it.

1381
00:58:09,590 --> 00:58:12,550
Perfect! Good job!

1382
00:58:12,550 --> 00:58:16,930
- When they see him and
witness him, and hear him,

1383
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:19,130
I'd like to believe
that they take a moment

1384
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:21,130
to evaluate themselves

1385
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:23,850
and anything that they've
gone through in life

1386
00:58:23,850 --> 00:58:26,390
can't be more difficult
than what he endures

1387
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:27,940
on a daily basis.

1388
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:30,310
- One thing I care
about more than anything

1389
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:33,660
is being a family, that is
one thing I take pride on,

1390
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:35,188
I love people.

1391
00:58:35,188 --> 00:58:38,380
I love you, I love you, I
love you, I love everyone.

1392
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:41,110
So if you guys can't show
love on this football field,

1393
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:42,610
then you better get off of it.

1394
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,583
Towards you Aden, who am I gonna go to?

1395
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:00,890
It was a fractured orbital bone

1396
00:59:00,890 --> 00:59:03,743
and my cheekbone is fractured as well,

1397
00:59:05,841 --> 00:59:08,403
I couldn't sleep, I couldn't chew.

1398
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:11,493
- I just felt bad for him.

1399
00:59:12,885 --> 00:59:14,970
You know he's got a hard life

1400
00:59:14,970 --> 00:59:17,073
and I try to make it as easy as I can.

1401
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:21,460
Things that you and I take for granted

1402
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:26,350
like brushing your teeth
or washing your face

1403
00:59:26,350 --> 00:59:29,370
or taking a shower or
going to the restroom

1404
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:33,047
Robert needs someone to help him.

1405
00:59:59,128 --> 01:00:03,628
But he's tough, two days
later he was at his practice.

1406
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:08,373
And his thing is now I
gotta be there for the kids.

1407
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:14,683
He's been waiting to be a
head coach for a long time.

1408

1409
01:00:20,722 --> 01:00:21,793
I didn't wanna let the kids down.

1410
01:00:24,879 --> 01:00:26,293
I just can't stay away I guess.

1411
01:00:28,610 --> 01:00:32,410
Me being challenged
has been my motivation.

1412
01:00:32,410 --> 01:00:34,928
All I gotta say is, who says I can't!?

1413
01:00:34,928 --> 01:00:35,761
- [Team] Nobody!

1414
01:00:35,761 --> 01:00:36,960

1415
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:37,845

1417
01:00:38,903 --> 01:00:39,940
- [Team] Nobody!

1418
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:42,400
- Who says I can't,
originally came from me

1419
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,860
just having a drive to accomplish

1420
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:46,955
whatever people doubted me for.

1421
01:00:46,955 --> 01:00:47,788
Who says I can't!?

1422
01:00:47,788 --> 01:00:48,621
- [Team] Nobody!

1423
01:00:48,621 --> 01:00:49,454

1424
01:00:49,454 --> 01:00:50,287
- [Team] Nobody!

1425
01:00:50,287 --> 01:00:51,120
- Who says I can't!?

1426
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:51,953
- [Team] Nobody!

1427
01:00:51,953 --> 01:00:52,786
- Who says I can't!?

1428

- [Team] Nobody!

1429
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:01,400
- If he's willing to do all of that

1430
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,812
then what are we willing to do?

1431
01:01:03,812 --> 01:01:06,479
(team chanting)

1432
01:01:11,470 --> 01:01:14,180
- It's go time, we've been
working hard all summer long.

1433
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:15,507

1434
01:01:15,507 --> 01:01:16,850
- [Team] Prospect!

1435
01:01:16,850 --> 01:01:18,623
Go kick ass, let's go.

1436
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:29,560
Those kids fought every single game,

1437
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:30,930
I mean I can't remember one game

1438
01:01:30,930 --> 01:01:32,610
that we were bigger than the other team,

1439
01:01:32,610 --> 01:01:34,253
but dammit we got the job done.

1440
01:01:35,548 --> 01:01:39,008
That's what I'm talking about!

1441

We got the momentum keep it up, lets go!

1442
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:53,850
JBT in the last ten years has
had mostly losing seasons.

1443
01:01:53,850 --> 01:01:56,840
He just really has done a
job that I haven't been able

1444
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:59,690
to see other coaches do
at that level before.

1445
01:01:59,690 --> 01:02:02,776
- I'm tryna send my Y over the middle

1446
01:02:02,776 --> 01:02:05,343
because it's gonna be
right here over the middle.

1447
01:02:12,351 --> 01:02:13,184

1451
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,973

of every single one of you,

1452
01:02:35,973 --> 01:02:38,110
but dammit we're not done yet,

1453
01:02:38,110 --> 01:02:40,160
so let's go finish the job off right now.

1454
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:47,640
- [Commentator] Might take a miracle plan

1455
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:50,043
to score the only points in this contest.

1456
01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:53,673
Passes off to his right, intercepted.

1457
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:59,150
4-37 play in the fourth quarter.

1458
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:01,103
Soprano looking for the first points.

1459
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,170
Kick on the way, has the distance,

1460
01:03:05,170 --> 01:03:10,170
and it's good and
Soprano takes a 3-0 lead.

1461
01:03:12,550 --> 01:03:16,100
- Let's just execute guys,
this is four league right here,

1462
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:18,843

1463
01:03:21,327 --> 01:03:26,327
- [Commentator] Fourteen for
the panthers, fourth down

1464
01:03:27,883 --> 01:03:29,953
played Jackson off to his
left and it's incomplete.

1465
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:36,344
Soprano gets the win and
cakes the division title.

1466
01:03:36,344 --> 01:03:38,344
What a win this afternoon over Prospect.

1467
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:41,897
- Don't worry about it,

1468
01:03:45,334 --> 01:03:47,404
family is the most important
thing remember that okay.

1469
01:03:47,404 --> 01:03:49,683
That's what we built this
team off of was family okay.

1470
01:03:51,312 --> 01:03:53,500
You got good days and bad days man.

1471
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:58,500
Today as a team it's okay,
I'm very proud of you,

1472
01:03:58,591 --> 01:03:59,424
the whole team.

1473
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:05,590
It's gonna hurt today and
that's okay if it hurts

1474
01:04:05,590 --> 01:04:06,740
because we cared a lot.

1475
01:04:08,179 --> 01:04:10,710
Because we love this game of football.

1476
01:04:10,710 --> 01:04:14,090
I really sincerely want
you guys to understand

1477
01:04:14,090 --> 01:04:16,143
how much I appreciate this.

1478
01:04:18,870 --> 01:04:22,293
You guys have given me
a lifetime of memories.

1479
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:31,900
- Our opponents they'd always doubt him

1480
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:33,793
cause they see a man in a wheelchair,

1481
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:39,590
to us we see our coach who's perfect.

1482
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:46,410
- When we were pushing him
off the field after the game,

1483
01:04:46,410 --> 01:04:49,943
makes me feel proud to
have him as my coach.

1484
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:54,463
- These kids would follow
him no matter where he go.

1485
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:57,880
- You can actually see
the changes in the kid.

1486
01:05:00,790 --> 01:05:01,940
- Can I give you a hug?

1487
01:05:04,653 --> 01:05:06,380
- You want the best for your children.

1488
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:07,660
I told him one time,

1489
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:09,410
there's not a lot of money in this Robert

1490
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:12,300
and he told me it's not everybody

1491
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:14,453
who does what they do for money.

1492
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:17,533
He's right.

1493
01:05:19,870 --> 01:05:21,870
- They give me the feeling of importance

1494
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:27,300
and I don't think they know
that and understand that.

1495
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:28,650
Maybe they will one day but

1496
01:05:32,690 --> 01:05:33,790
I love those kids

1497
01:05:33,790 --> 01:05:35,540
and I'm always gonna remember them.

1498
01:05:37,670 --> 01:05:41,314
I think we make a perfect
team, can we agree on that?

1499
01:05:41,314 --> 01:05:42,147
- [Team] Yes coach.

1500

because we depend on power more than ever.

1564
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:37,470
When the power goes
out, we lose everything.

1565
01:08:37,470 --> 01:08:40,120
We can't even charge our smartphones.

1566
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:41,700
Now more than ever,

1567
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:45,600
you need a Generac automatic
home standby generator.

1576
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:05,530

Juju Smith-Schuster
will enter training camp

1614
01:11:13,950 --> 01:11:16,720
as the Pittsburgh Steelers
number one wide-receiver

1615
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:19,340
for the first time in his career.

1616
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:21,600
Here is Smith-Schuster from earlier today

1617
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:24,030
on what it's like on the expectations

1618
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:25,853
of stepping into that role.

1619
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:28,939
I mean all the people used to say,

1620
01:11:28,939 --> 01:11:31,238
you're the number one guy this year

1621
01:11:31,238 --> 01:11:33,037
but more for myself man I
just see it more opportunity

1622
01:11:33,037 --> 01:11:34,950
for not just myself but
for other guys to step up.

1623
01:11:34,950 --> 01:11:37,500
You're talking about AB
having a hundred catches

1624
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:38,760
over a thousand yards.

1625
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:41,030
Those yards, those catches are
gonna be spread out you know.

1626
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:42,810
Obviously between James
Conner, Vance Donald,

1627
01:11:42,810 --> 01:11:43,643
and James Washington, Donte Moncrief,

1628
01:11:43,643 --> 01:11:46,840
a lot of guys, James Samuels.

1629
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:48,045
There are so many guys who
are gonna get more touches,

1630
01:11:48,045 --> 01:11:50,920
more catches, more yards, more yak.

1631
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:52,480
You know, just to help them individually.

1632
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:55,700
But at the end of the day
I'm still the same dude,

1633
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:59,630
same Juju, same person, I'm
just last year I was 21,

1634
01:11:59,630 --> 01:12:01,233
this year I'm 22 same thing.

1635
01:12:02,571 --> 01:12:03,640
- Yes, the older, wiser,

1636
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:06,741
more mature 22 year old
Juju Smith-Schuster,

1637
01:12:06,741 --> 01:12:09,690
with a good yak reference,
always a good day.

1638
01:12:09,690 --> 01:12:11,450
- Alright listen, this
got us thinking obviously

1639
01:12:11,450 --> 01:12:13,740
big shoes to fill with
Antonio Brown deported.

1640
01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:15,180
He's now an Oakland Raider.

1641
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:16,570
So, let's go one by one.

1642
01:12:16,570 --> 01:12:19,740
Receptions, more or less,
Antonio or Juju Mike?

1643
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:21,210
- Juju just made all my points for me.

1644
01:12:21,210 --> 01:12:23,030
They're gonna spread the
ball around in Pittsburgh,

1645
01:12:23,030 --> 01:12:26,060
plus you have a head coach Jon
Gruden who's the play caller,

1646
01:12:26,060 --> 01:12:27,770
they gave up a lot of
money and picks to get EB.

1647
01:12:27,770 --> 01:12:30,578
EB will have more receptions.

1648
01:12:30,578 --> 01:12:32,240
- I do think Jon Gruden motivated

1649
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:33,820
to get Antonio Brown the football.

1650
01:12:33,820 --> 01:12:35,350
How about touch downs Diana?

1651
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:37,100
- Touch downs I'm gonna
go with AB as well.

1652
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:39,960
You know you actually teamed
me up perfectly there Wendy

1653
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:42,610
because I think if there
is anyone that wants

1654
01:12:42,610 --> 01:12:45,870
to make Antonio Brown work in Oakland,

1655
01:12:45,870 --> 01:12:47,040
cause they have to figure out

1656
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:48,990
why the paid him all that
money, it's gonna be Jon Gruden.

1657
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:51,566
So, he's obviously callin'
all the shots on offense here

1658
01:12:51,566 --> 01:12:55,260
and in terms of
wide-receivers in the game,

1659
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:57,220
we can debate all long who is the best

1660
01:12:57,220 --> 01:13:00,440
but we all know how special AB can be.

1661
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:02,360
And as soon as he can
figure out that chemistry

1662
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:04,432
with Derek Carr I think he's
gonna have more touchdowns

1663
01:13:04,432 --> 01:13:05,265
than Juju does.

1664
01:13:05,265 --> 01:13:06,550
- All right, there's
receptions, there's touchdowns

1665
01:13:06,550 --> 01:13:09,200
and how about all purpose
yards Victor Cruz.

1666
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:10,100
- I'm gonna give Juju some love here

1667
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:12,270
because clearly Mike and Diana

1668
01:13:12,270 --> 01:13:14,430
did not give him any love so far.

1669
01:13:14,430 --> 01:13:15,263
But I'm going with Yards,

1670
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:17,645
he's the bona fide number one guy now

1671
01:13:17,645 --> 01:13:19,070
which means in those pressure situations

1672
01:13:19,070 --> 01:13:21,820
Ben will be looking to him to
be that number one receiver

1673
01:13:21,820 --> 01:13:23,210
and get him the ball in space

1674
01:13:23,210 --> 01:13:24,830
either on drag routes, deep routes,

1675
01:13:24,830 --> 01:13:26,360
he could run any route in the book,

1676
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:28,247
and it's gonna be interesting to see

1677
01:13:28,247 --> 01:13:29,450
just how they use him
as the number one guy.

1678
01:13:29,450 --> 01:13:30,730
- All right look, it's a team game

1679
01:13:30,730 --> 01:13:32,530
and all of those things are what they are.

1680
01:13:32,530 --> 01:13:35,857
But what really matters of
course, you hope anyway,

1681
01:13:35,857 --> 01:13:38,670
are the number of wins
from each of these teams.

1682
01:13:38,670 --> 01:13:40,170
We've got the Steelers,
we've got the Raiders.

1683
01:13:40,170 --> 01:13:41,350
Who gets the head cheer?.

1684
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:43,050
- Yeah it's gonna be Pittsburgh.

1685
01:13:43,050 --> 01:13:45,480
I think we're gonna see an
improvement with Oakland,

1686
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:46,690
especially in offense.

1687
01:13:46,690 --> 01:13:48,917
Josh Jacobs, Terrel
Williams, obviously AB,

1688
01:13:48,917 --> 01:13:51,690
another year with Derek
Carr and Jon Gruden.

1689
01:13:51,690 --> 01:13:53,997
Really worry about defense
and rushing the pass

1690
01:13:53,997 --> 01:13:57,072
but obviously they lost
Cleo Mack a year ago,

1691
01:13:57,072 --> 01:13:59,329
while they drafted Clelin
Ferrell from the first round.

1692
01:13:59,329 --> 01:14:02,130
It's gonna take a while
for him to get going.

1693
01:14:02,130 --> 01:14:04,380
I think they're gonna
be a working progress

1694
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:06,210
in terms of how they are on defense.

1695
01:14:06,210 --> 01:14:07,740
I'm going with Mike Tomlin

1696
01:14:07,740 --> 01:14:10,120
and a very mature Pittsburgh
Steeler organization.

1697
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:12,485
- I think that's a pretty good bet.

1698
01:14:12,485 --> 01:14:13,318
How about celebrations?

1699
01:14:13,318 --> 01:14:14,151
Is this even a question?

1700
01:14:14,151 --> 01:14:15,590
Well I guess maybe.

1701
01:14:15,590 --> 01:14:17,520
- It's not a question at
all, I'm going with Juju

1702
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:20,210
mainly because it doesn't
even have to be him

1703
01:14:20,210 --> 01:14:22,787
that has to score to do the celebrations.

1704
01:14:22,787 --> 01:14:25,490
He's made that clear,
everybody is in on this thing,

1705
01:14:25,490 --> 01:14:27,820
so whether it's him or
whether it's Vance McDonald

1706
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:30,550
or any other person on that team.

1707
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:31,910
They're gonna be celebrating

1708
01:14:31,910 --> 01:14:33,670
and Juju will be leading the way.

1709
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:35,780
- And let me tell you,
if you did not see it,

1710
01:14:35,780 --> 01:14:37,990
Juju was with us about an hour ago

1711
01:14:37,990 --> 01:14:40,580
and he said that he is
working on Ben Roethlisberger

1712
01:14:40,580 --> 01:14:41,882
to get him on.

1713
01:14:41,882 --> 01:14:43,691
He has not committed but he's trying.

1714
01:14:43,691 --> 01:14:45,300
- We'll see him in there.
- We'll see about that.

1715
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:46,190
- I like that you've become

1716
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:48,180
the resident celebration expert for us,

1717
01:14:48,180 --> 01:14:50,520
it's like anything celebration
that we have to go to Victor.

1718
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:51,910
- I am taking a bow for you.

1719
01:14:51,910 --> 01:14:54,157
- We have one more
category, one more category.

1720
01:14:54,157 --> 01:14:56,166
How about the drama.

1721
01:14:56,166 --> 01:14:58,955
- Oh the drama.
- Is it on there or no?

1722
01:14:58,955 --> 01:15:00,630
- Let's see here.

1723
01:15:00,630 --> 01:15:02,530
- I guess not, alright pretend.

1724
01:15:03,710 --> 01:15:04,630
Speaking of drama.

1725
01:15:04,630 --> 01:15:06,960
- I'm gonna go with what history says

1726
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:10,383
and I think it's gonna
be Antonio Brown on this

1727
01:15:10,383 --> 01:15:12,452
and I'm gonna stick with that thought.

1728
01:15:12,452 --> 01:15:14,450
I like the way Juju
Smith-Schuster is maturing

1729
01:15:14,450 --> 01:15:17,580
into not just a mentor
to those younger players

1730
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:19,320
but an actual leader on the Steelers team.

1731
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:22,600
And for Antonio Brown there
are a lot of personalities

1732
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:24,020
on this roster now.

1733
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:25,320
Obviously, we know Jon Bruden

1734
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:28,063
is the focal point of this
team no matter who's on it.

1735
01:15:29,193 --> 01:15:31,730
But I think there's going to
be points during the season

1736
01:15:31,730 --> 01:15:36,390
where the AB of Pittsburgh
will show its face in Oakland.

1737
01:15:36,390 --> 01:15:38,570
- You cannot tell, we will
not get through this season

1738
01:15:38,570 --> 01:15:40,831
without him getting irked with
Derek Carr, there's no way.

1739
01:15:40,831 --> 01:15:44,903
- It takes one sailed ball
and he's gonna come at like,

1740
01:15:44,903 --> 01:15:47,445
really, really?
- Put some money on it.

1741
01:15:47,445 --> 01:15:49,070
- The ESPYS are right around the corner,

1742
01:15:49,070 --> 01:15:50,980
who is getting your vote

1743
01:15:52,023 --> 01:15:54,073
for the best record-breaking performance.

1744
01:15:55,175 --> 01:15:57,737
Come on, you know Drew
Brees wants your vote.

1745
01:16:00,408 --> 01:16:02,817
- [Commentator] Drew Brees has done it,

1746
01:16:02,817 --> 01:16:05,162
NFL's all time leading passer.

1747
01:16:05,162 --> 01:16:10,162
- (crowd cheering drowns out
speaker) an award for right?

1748
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:16,790
- Remember that degree
you got in taxation?

1749
01:16:16,790 --> 01:16:19,138
Of course you don't because you didn't.

1750
01:16:19,138 --> 01:16:21,740
Your job isn't understanding tax code,

1751
01:16:21,740 --> 01:16:25,770
it's understanding why that
will get him a body like that.

1752
01:16:25,770 --> 01:16:28,360
Move. That.

1753
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:30,260
Your job isn't doing hard work.

1754
01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:33,406
Here, it's making her do hard work

1755
01:16:33,406 --> 01:16:35,570
and getting paid for it.

1756
01:16:35,570 --> 01:16:37,000
- [Narrator] Snap and sort your expenses

1757

- Jody, it's time to get yours.

1759
01:16:41,860 --> 01:16:43,710
- [Narrator] QuickBooks, backing you.

1760
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,770
- This is owed to State Farm for winning

1761
01:16:46,770 --> 01:16:49,893
five JD Power awards in
a row for life insurance.

1762
01:16:50,985 --> 01:16:54,010
(playing flute)

1763
01:16:54,010 --> 01:16:54,963
In B minor.

1764
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:59,090
- [Narrator] Great stuff.

1765
01:16:59,090 --> 01:17:00,040
- Not running.

1766
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:01,440
Why am I not running?

1767
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:03,190
Because the new DQ sour Blizzard menu

1768
01:17:03,190 --> 01:17:06,390
is only here for a few more
weeks with seven great flavors

1769
01:17:06,390 --> 01:17:08,823
like new sour patch
kids and Brownie dough.

1770
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:10,533
- Not running.

1771
01:17:11,947 --> 01:17:14,690
- [Narrator] DQ, happy tastes good.

1772
01:17:14,690 --> 01:17:18,420
- [Narrator] The hamsters
run hopelessly in their cage,

1773
01:17:18,420 --> 01:17:21,653
content on their endless quest to nowhere.

1774
01:17:22,533 --> 01:17:23,850
(engine roaring)

1775
01:17:23,850 --> 01:17:27,983
But perhaps this year, a more
exhilarating endeavor awaits.

1776
01:17:29,409 --> 01:17:32,326

1777

- Great! There you go.

1784
01:17:50,810 --> 01:17:52,680
- Well it does need to be a vehicle.

1785
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:55,010
- But I need this out of my house.

1786

and other times you don't.

1810

Manning left to pass,

1840
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:30,679
he starts in shotgun, drops
back, looks to the far sideline.

1841
01:20:31,070 --> 01:20:34,403
Wide open and Smith what a way to do it!

1842
01:20:39,922 --> 01:20:41,766
- [Commentator] Drew Brees is the NFL's

1843
01:20:41,766 --> 01:20:42,640
all time leading passer.

1844
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:45,889
- I won, how about that!?

1845
01:20:45,889 --> 01:20:47,519
- [Commentator] There's only one word

1846
01:20:47,519 --> 01:20:50,019
that comes to mind, greatness.

1847
01:20:52,270 --> 01:20:54,030
- [Wendy] Well we continue to
highlight some of the stars

1848
01:20:54,030 --> 01:20:56,700
around the NFL that earned
ESPY nominations this year.

1849
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:58,960
The amazing moment from Drew Brees

1850
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:02,640
is up for the ESPY for best
record breaking performance.

1851
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:04,360
Brees broke the NFL passing record

1852
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:07,687
when he passed Peyton
Manning's mark of 71,940 yards.

1853
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:13,090
And Victor you made this
point yesterday and it's true.

1854
01:21:13,090 --> 01:21:15,497
I think last year was his
best bet at winning the MVP

1855
01:21:15,497 --> 01:21:17,800
you just had this pesky
little Patrick Mahomes

1856
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:21,970
who did things that just
didn't seem possible

1857
01:21:21,970 --> 01:21:23,660
to keep Brees from winning that award.

1858
01:21:23,660 --> 01:21:25,430
- Exactly, and then how do you amass

1859
01:21:25,430 --> 01:21:27,650
such a monumental record like this

1860
01:21:27,650 --> 01:21:29,080
on an illustrious career

1861
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:31,959
that he's had and not win
the league MVP one time.

1862
01:21:31,959 --> 01:21:35,151
I mean obviously, probably
Peyton Manning won

1863
01:21:35,151 --> 01:21:36,378
a couple of those, Tom Brady,

1864
01:21:36,378 --> 01:21:37,440
all of those tremendous players.

1865
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:40,160
But he's gotta get it one time,
I mean he's put numbers up

1866
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:41,766
each and every year.

1867
01:21:41,766 --> 01:21:42,661
I think there's years

1868
01:21:42,661 --> 01:21:44,809
that he kinda just goes under the radar

1869
01:21:44,809 --> 01:21:45,642
out there in New Orleans
with those play makers

1870
01:21:45,642 --> 01:21:47,030
and everybody he's got.

1871
01:21:47,030 --> 01:21:49,374
I think this is the year where he's like,

1872
01:21:49,374 --> 01:21:50,830
you know what I'm gonna put
a nice pretty little red bow

1873
01:21:51,706 --> 01:21:54,390
on this career and put a
NFL league MVP under my belt

1874
01:21:54,390 --> 01:21:56,090
and get back to the big dance

1875
01:21:56,090 --> 01:21:58,270
hopefully and keep things going.

1876
01:21:58,270 --> 01:22:00,131
- So, in fairness he has
been a Superbowl MVP,

1877
01:22:00,131 --> 01:22:04,000
two time offensive player
- Ten years.

1878
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,900
- But the hall of fame quality
quarterback Drew Brees'

1879
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:08,930
you would like to see him go.

1880
01:22:08,930 --> 01:22:10,780
Although I know he'd take
another Lombardi Trophy

1881
01:22:10,780 --> 01:22:11,740
any day of the week.

1882
01:22:11,740 --> 01:22:13,350
- Now that you can't dispute.

1883
01:22:13,350 --> 01:22:15,800
But at least give him one
League MVP, he's earned it.

1884
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:17,770
- We'll show you why how about this?

1885
01:22:17,770 --> 01:22:19,759
How about the best of
the best of Drew Brees.

1886
01:22:19,759 --> 01:22:21,290
- [Victor] This is vintage right here.

1887
01:22:21,290 --> 01:22:23,618
- [Wendy] Yeah vintage '04 he was a

1888
01:22:23,618 --> 01:22:24,451
(speaks in foreign language).

1889
01:22:24,451 --> 01:22:26,290
Play action, deep to Erick Parker,

1890
01:22:26,290 --> 01:22:29,460
breaks a tackle for a 79 yard touchdown.

1891
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:31,300
- [Victor] I like it,
showing that arm off.

1892
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:32,670
- [Wendy] In black and white there.

1893
01:22:32,670 --> 01:22:35,740
- [Victor] Real early, real
pixelated, grainy, I love it.

1894
01:22:35,740 --> 01:22:38,676
- [Mike] Pixelated or something like that.

1895
01:22:38,676 --> 01:22:40,270
- [Wendy] 2004 against the Packers.

1896
01:22:40,270 --> 01:22:44,710
Three steps up, just
glazed this one perfectly

1897
01:22:44,710 --> 01:22:48,230
into the arms of Brandin Cooks,
a 50 yard touchdown strike.

1898
01:22:48,230 --> 01:22:49,670
- [Mike] You know what else is crazy?

1899
01:22:49,670 --> 01:22:50,503
- [Wendy] That is a dime.

1900
01:22:50,503 --> 01:22:52,654
- [Mike] He's stepping up in the pocket.

1901
01:22:52,654 --> 01:22:53,966
A lot of times you see
younger quarterbacks

1902
01:22:53,966 --> 01:22:55,908
step up in the pocket
and just check it out.

1903
01:22:55,908 --> 01:22:57,230
He's stepping up in the
pocket and keeping his eyes

1904
01:22:57,230 --> 01:22:59,240
down the field put so much
pressure on a defense.

1905
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:01,980
- [Wendy] '06 against the Bengals.

1906
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:04,623
The handoff here it's a flee flicker

1907
01:23:04,623 --> 01:23:08,520
and then Joe Horn there
between two defenders,

1908
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:12,250
a 72 yard touchdown and
it's that kind of arm

1909
01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:14,673
that we see on occasion.

1910
01:23:14,673 --> 01:23:17,753
And that's Victor Cruz ass right there.

1911
01:23:17,753 --> 01:23:22,753
On moving now to the modern
day against the Panthers,

1912
01:23:22,790 --> 01:23:27,040
Brees here to Ted Ginn
in the end zone 49 yards.

1913
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:28,530
- [Victor] The consistency
that we're seeing here

1914
01:23:28,530 --> 01:23:29,900
is he's not even being touched,

1915
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:32,170
there are barely even people around him

1916
01:23:32,170 --> 01:23:33,710
while he's making these throws.

1917
01:23:33,710 --> 01:23:35,860
Like that's indicative to the
type of team he's been around

1918
01:23:35,860 --> 01:23:37,737
that offensive line
taking good care of him.

1919
01:23:37,737 --> 01:23:41,200
- [Wendy] '06 NFC
Championship, Saints and Bears.

1920
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:43,760
Brees here to Reggie Bush.

1921
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:45,090
- [Mike] You know that's a great example

1922
01:23:45,090 --> 01:23:47,180
of a really effective quarterback play.

1923
01:23:47,180 --> 01:23:49,400
Sometimes you have to
throw as hard as you can.

1924
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:50,920
That was a great touch throw.

1925
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:52,370
It led the running back

1926
01:23:52,370 --> 01:23:55,170
who takes it all the way
by what touch he has.

1927
01:23:55,170 --> 01:23:58,055
And that's an underrated
aspect of playing quarterback.

1928
01:23:58,055 --> 01:24:02,820
- [Wendy] Then 2016 against the Raiders.

1929
01:24:02,820 --> 01:24:06,100
The longest career pass, a 90...

1930
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:07,297
Is this a 98?

1931
01:24:07,297 --> 01:24:08,840
Well he's got the...

1932
01:24:09,830 --> 01:24:11,850
Little yards out to catch
- [Victor] One yard back.

1933
01:24:11,850 --> 01:24:12,683
- [Wendy] To Brandin Cooks.

1934
01:24:12,683 --> 01:24:13,690
An incredible career,

1935
01:24:13,690 --> 01:24:16,893
certainly should be featured
on the hall of fame.

1936
01:24:16,893 --> 01:24:19,890
Perhaps a future NFL MVP,

1937
01:24:19,890 --> 01:24:23,030
you can vote in the ESPYS
right now at ESPYS.com.

1938
01:24:23,030 --> 01:24:25,380
Again, Brees up for record
breaking performance

1939
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:27,267
along with three other moments

1940
01:24:27,267 --> 01:24:28,100
including Klay Thompson's record

1941
01:24:28,100 --> 01:24:31,323
for three pointers in a game with 14.

1942
01:24:32,460 --> 01:24:33,690
Alright, we gave you our opinion

1943
01:24:33,690 --> 01:24:35,286

the NFL Highlight King?

but they are who we thought they were.

1948
01:25:00,150 --> 01:25:02,100

1949
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:07,100
listen, it's not about
height, it's about heart.

1950
01:25:07,180 --> 01:25:10,463
It breaks through walls
and outruns demons.

1951
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:13,823
It outworks everybody.

1952
01:25:14,970 --> 01:25:15,920
When they see that,

1953
01:25:16,835 --> 01:25:18,935
they ain't gonna know what to do with you.

1954
01:25:20,259 --> 01:25:23,768

Ravens select Marquise Brown.

each other and was--

Or to carry on a legacy?

1993

Sports Center 6:00 Eastern

2037
01:29:22,700 --> 01:29:24,810
Everybody stated their case,

2038
01:29:24,810 --> 01:29:26,800
it's not a real ESPY but
we're handing one out.

2039
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:30,920
The NFL Highlight King and Dianna Russini

2040
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:33,637
who made the case for Patrick Mahomes.

2041
01:29:33,637 --> 01:29:35,040
I don't know guys, I happen to agree.

2042
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:37,960
I mean the man is a highlight machine.

2043
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:40,043
- [Mike] I'll throw a challenge flag here,

2044
01:29:42,129 --> 01:29:43,180
we're talking about the NFL right?

2045
01:29:43,180 --> 01:29:45,060
We haven't had any NFL
players yet for Tyler

2046
01:29:45,060 --> 01:29:46,890
so we're in the wrong category.

2047
01:29:46,890 --> 01:29:49,175
We got the right player
maybe in the wrong category.

2048
01:29:49,175 --> 01:29:50,830
- So what you're saying
you were handicapped

2049
01:29:50,830 --> 01:29:52,278
from the get go?

2050
01:29:52,278 --> 01:29:56,053
- (crosstalk drowns out speaker)

2051
01:29:56,053 --> 01:29:57,040
- So put the pressure on you then.

2052
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:59,510
So, are you going with team
Victor with Sequon Barkley

2053
01:29:59,510 --> 01:30:02,110
or team Diana Russini
with Patrick Mahomes?

2054
01:30:02,110 --> 01:30:04,980
- I'm a free agent, I'm going
with the highest bidder.

2055
01:30:04,980 --> 01:30:06,370
- Okay we'll see how it works.

2056
01:30:06,370 --> 01:30:07,830
- We'll talk offscreen.

2057
01:30:07,830 --> 01:30:09,230
- Listen, July 4th holiday,

2058
01:30:09,230 --> 01:30:10,500
we wanna say a special thank you

2059
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:13,780

serving around the world.

2060

We appreciate.
