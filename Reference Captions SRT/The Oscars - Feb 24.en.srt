1
00:00:00,109 --> 00:00:02,629
(audience cheering)

2
00:00:02,629 --> 00:00:04,620
- (sighs) um,

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:10,400
to be standing here representing um,

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,690
one of the greatest artists of
our time, James Baldwin, is--

5
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:19,480
(audience applauding)

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,000
It's a little surreal.

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,800
James Baldwin birthed this
baby and Barry (crying)

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,800
you nurtured her, you
surrounded her with so much love

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,560
and support so it's appropriate
for me to be standing here

10
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:43,880
cause I'm an example of what it looks like

11
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,830
when support and love
is poured into someone.

12
00:00:47,664 --> 00:00:48,530
(sighs) Mom,

13
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:53,730
I love you so much.
(applauding)

14
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,480
Thank you for teaching me
that god is always leaning,

15
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,830
always has been leaning in my direction.

16
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:11,830
Gamosis, they'll ask me
about that later. (laughing)

17
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,790
So many people to thank, Chelsea Barnard,

18
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:19,460
who brought this project to Anna Perna,

19
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:24,460
Megan Ellinson, Anna Perna,
plan B, this amazing cast.

20
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:33,220
My sisters in art,
Marina, Amy, Emma, Rachel,

21
00:01:37,763 --> 00:01:40,120
it has been an honor to have my name

22
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,920
be just said with yours
this whole step of the way

23
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,760
has been pretty amazing.

24
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:50,760
The Rivers family, Kiki,
Coleman, Tiana, Stephan. (sighs)

25
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,610
God is good all the time.

26
00:01:57,144 --> 00:02:01,811
(cheering)
(applauding)

27
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,210
- [Announcer] Please welcome Jason Mamoa

28
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:11,270
and Academy Award winning
actress, Helen Miran.

29
00:02:12,523 --> 00:02:17,523
(gentle orchestral music)
(applauding)

30
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,670
- Well you know, honestly, I swear to god

31
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:36,080
that Jason and I didn't
coordinate our outfits tonight.

32
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,990
This was purely accidental, but you know,

33
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,670
it just goes to show,
doesn't it, that these days,

34
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,480
a Hawaiian god and a
very mature English woman

35
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,710
can actually wear the same color.

36
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,020
We can both wear pink. (laughing)

37
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,970
- Finally, times are changing.

38
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,773
- [Helen] Yeah.
- Boom.

39
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,050
(laughing)

40
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,560
- Documentary film makers bring us stories

41
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,380
of real people doing real
things and in doing so,

42
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,020
they can often open our eyes
to the most important issues

43
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,560
of yesterday, today and tomorrow.

44
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,420
- They're insightful,
they're illuminating,

45
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:12,550
sometimes astonishing, always
authentic and revelatory.

46
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:16,120
Here are the nominees for
best documentary feature.

47
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,660
Free Solo, Elizabeth Chai
Vasarhelyi, Jimmy Chin,

48
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,170
Evan Hayes and Shannon Dill.

49
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,130
- The chance of me
falling off is quite low

50
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,780
even though the consequence
is extremely high

51
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,890
and that's kind of like one of
the appeals of free soloing.

52
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:34,560
- [Helen] Hale County This
Morning, This Evening,

53

Ramell Ross, Joslyn Barnes and Su Kim.

54
00:03:38,944 --> 00:03:40,940
- I don't want my son to
know that I didn't graduate.

55
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,390
I just want to make life better for him.

56
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:47,230
- [Helen] Minding the Gap,
Bing Liu and Diane Quon.

57
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,230
- [Man] I'm making this film because I was

58
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,060
physically disciplined by my step-father

59
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,520
and it didn't make sense to me

60
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,520
and I saw myself in your own story.

61
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,490
- [Helen] Of Fathers
and Sons, Talal Derki,

62
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:03,490
Ansgar Frerich, Eva Kemme
and Tobias N. Seibert.

63
00:04:03,713 --> 00:04:07,546
(speaking a foreign language)

64
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,220
- [Helen] RBG, Betsy West and Julie Cohen.

65
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:20,000
- I ask no favor for my sex.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,480
All I ask of our brethren is that they

67
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,280
take their feet off our necks.

68
00:04:27,498 --> 00:04:29,915
(applauding)

69
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,800
- And the Oscar goes to,

70
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,146
Free Solo.

71
00:04:37,146 --> 00:04:40,736
(cheering)
(applauding)

72
00:04:40,736 --> 00:04:43,070
- [Announcer] This is the

74

(cheering)

77
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:19,430
- [Man] Wow, wow.

78
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,330
- Breath. (chuckles)

79
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,660
- Wow, thank you.

80
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,163
Thank you.

81
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,830
Thank you National Geographic
for believing in us

82
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,620
and for hiring women and people of color

83
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,670
cause we only help make the films better.

84
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:41,050
Thank you to all the amazing
people who worked on this film,

85
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,240
Evan, Shannon--

86
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,910
- Our high angle team.

87
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:47,560
- I mean, it was a work of an army

88
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,540
and we appreciate you in every way.

89
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,230
Thank you to our families,

90
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,780
especially our two kids,
Brean, I know you're here.

91
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,153
- James.

92
00:05:58,752 --> 00:06:01,002
(laughing)

93
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,570
- And then thank you to Sani McCannles,

94
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,937
you climbed your own mountain
that day, so thank you, Sani.

95
00:06:12,937 --> 00:06:15,354
(applauding)

96
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,320
This film would be so boring without you,

97
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,530
I'm just saying, okay.

98
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:24,590
Okay anyway, thank you Alex
Honeld for giving us courage

99
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:27,510
and teaching us how to
believe in the impossible

100
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,110
and inspiring us.

101
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,490
This film is for everyone who
believes in the impossible.

102
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,517

Rise above with the
uncompromising Cadillac SUV's.

122
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,120
- I go to a lot of
different music festivals,

123
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,160
a lot of different
concerts and when I'm in

124
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,430
these large crowds, even when
I'm with tens of thousands

125
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:16,740
of people and I just love
being the friend with service.

126
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,890
It's really cool to be
able to take a photo,

127
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,570
take a video, be immediately able to

128
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,030
post it on my social media.

129
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,170
Because I am tall,

130
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:27,030
I get that good kind of
view on the stage, amazing.

131

- [Man] There for you

of a future generation,

135
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:42,390
you and I, we're already
speaking to each other

136
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:45,240
from across time and I thought I'd share

137
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,040
this thought with you, if
you're burning to tell a story,

138
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,420
if you see the images in your
mind, then go make your movie.

139
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,780
- [Man] Your film will speak to many

140
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,590
with a singular voice.

141
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,610
Ask yourself what you have to say

142
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:01,255
and then say it in ways
that are unique to you.

00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,140
- [Man] Pick up a camera and get going.

150
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,520
- [Woman] Take action.

151
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,910
I ask, if not you, who?

152
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,070
- And I'm looking forward to
hearing back from you soon.

153
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,130
Thank you.

154

161
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,580
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

- [Man] What door am I at?

179
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,360
- Patio door, police are on their way.

Series premiere, Wednesday
10/9 central on ABC.

212
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,954
- [Announcer] The Oscars
on ABC brought to you by,

213
00:11:25,954 --> 00:11:27,994
Google.

214
00:11:27,994 --> 00:11:32,994
(energetic orchestral music)
(audience applauding)

215
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:37,634
From Rage Against the
Machine, here's Tom Morello.

216
00:11:37,634 --> 00:11:42,634
(audience cheering)
(applauding)

217
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:46,760
- Movies, like music, can
do more than entertain.

218
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,520
A great movie can become
a part of the conversation

219
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,380
of history and like our next movie,

220
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,340
and the kind of songs I like to make,

221
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:57,250
it can do it with feedback,
noise and yes, anger.

222
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,610
Adam McKay's, Vice, is such a film.

223
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,760
Shredding the traditional biopic structure

224
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,960
with passion and humor, Vice
seeks to put a spotlight

225
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,190
on a man who avoided it his
whole career, Dick Chaney.

226
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:11,220
Brilliantly acted, the film
is a lesson about the past

227
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,120
that serves as a warning about
the present and the future.

228
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,332
War, greed, truth, lies, fatherhood, love,

229
00:12:19,332 --> 00:12:23,170
torture and betrayal
all swirl around in Vice

230
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:25,840
with a hard backbeat
and a killer baseline.

231
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,480
Some will dig it, some
will cover their ears,

232
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,460
but everyone will do the one thing

233
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:33,390
the movie begs us to do, react.

234
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,010
This is Vice.

235
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,310
- [Man] So what's the plan?

236
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:42,090
- The plan is to take over the damn place.

237
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:44,650
- George, you're a kinetic leader.

238
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,202
You make decisions based on instinct.

239
00:12:47,202 --> 00:12:48,260
(laughing)

240
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,132
- People always said that.

241
00:12:50,132 --> 00:12:52,370
- I know what I'm gonna show
the world, true raw power,

242
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:55,900
of the American presidency.

243
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,860
- That's not something the
vice president really does.

244
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,250
- Oh, it is now.

245
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,840
- You need to remember
that if you have power,

246
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,990
people will always try
to take it from you.

247
00:13:08,082 --> 00:13:10,499
(applauding)

248
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,700
- [Announcer] Please welcome
Elsie Fisher and Stephan James.

249
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,030
- It doesn't take a magic
wand to transform an actor

250
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:28,620
into a character whose look is memorable

251
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,530
and meaningful to the story.

252
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,400
- All it takes are this year's nominees

253
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,550
for achievement in
makeup and hair styling.

254

Biscoe and Patricia Dehaney.

258
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,920

259
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,310
Greg Cannom, Kate Biscoe and
Patricia Dehaney for Vice.

260
00:14:02,191 --> 00:14:06,858
(cheering)
(applauding)

261
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,840
- [Announcer] This is the
first Oscar and nomination

262
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,430
for Kate Biscoe and Patricia Dehaney,

263
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:17,570
the forth Oscar and 10th
nomination for Greg Cannom.

264
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,980
Oscars in this category have
been awarded since 1981.

265
00:14:24,832 --> 00:14:28,332
(gentle orchestral music)

266
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:41,170

(applauding)
(gentle orchestral music)

294
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,060
- [Announcer] Please
welcome Brian Tyree Henry

295
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:17,257
and a nominee tonight for
actress in a leading role,

296
00:16:17,257 --> 00:16:19,354
Melissa McCarthy.

297
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:22,521
(audience applauding)

298
00:16:32,423 --> 00:16:35,423
(audience laughing)

299
00:16:48,161 --> 00:16:52,277
- A rakish tilt to a hat,
the drape of fabric just so,

300
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:57,581
nuance and sophistication
are just two qualities--

301
00:16:57,581 --> 00:16:59,890
(laughing)

302
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,740
of the most effective costume design.

303
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,440
- These artists create
a pettish of textiles

304
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:10,560
with authenticity, yet never
distract from the story.

305
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,240
Costume designers construct
the looks that ground

306
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,430
a character to a particular time and place

307
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:23,520
in the subtlest, subtlest of ways.

308
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,150
- [Brian] So true.

309
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,833
So true.

310
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:30,480
- So true.

311
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,860

00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:35,270

320
00:18:17,371 --> 00:18:20,371
(audience laughing)

321
00:18:21,398 --> 00:18:22,782
can't get it.

322
00:18:22,782 --> 00:18:24,352
- Here, yeah,

323
00:18:24,352 --> 00:18:25,700
okay.

324
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,533
- Get it, okay.

325
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,902
Black Panther, Ruth Carter.

326
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:34,410
(cheering)
(applauding)

327
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,030
- [Announcer] This is the first Oscar

328
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:38,900
and third nomination for Ruth Carter.

329
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,520
She was previously
nominated in this category

330
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,930
for Malcolm X and Amistaad.

331
00:18:44,193 --> 00:18:47,693
(gentle orchestral music)

332
00:18:57,737 --> 00:18:59,487
- Wow, wow, I got it.

333
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,110
Wow, this has been a long time coming.

334
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,620
(laughing)

335
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:14,750
Spike Lee, thank you for my start.

336
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,150
I hope this makes you proud.

337
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,593
Woo.

338
00:19:21,639 --> 00:19:24,170
(laughing)

339
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:27,470
Marvel may have created
the first black superhero,

340
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,670
but through costume design,

341
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:33,490
we turned him into an African king.

342
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:36,100
(applauding)

343
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,580
It's been my life's
honor to create costumes.

344
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,510
Thank you to the Academy.

345
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:44,620
Thank you for honoring African royalty

346
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:49,620
and the empowered way women
can look and lead on screen.

347
00:19:49,951 --> 00:19:52,368
(applauding)

348
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:56,020
Thank you to my crews around the world

349
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:59,330
who helped bring Waconda to life,

350
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,790
our genius director, Ryan Cugler.

351
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:07,930
You are a guiding force.

352
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:11,040
Thank you for your trust
and understanding my role

353
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,410
in telling the African American story.

354
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:18,580
Adding vibranium to
costumes is very expensive

355
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:22,330
so thank you, Victoria,
Alonzo, Kevin Fahee,

356
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:27,330
Luis Esparzido, Jeffrey Chernov,
Bob Eiger and Nate Moore.

357
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,940
My career is built with
passion to tell stories

358
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,470
that allow us to know ourselves better.

359
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:39,300
This is for my 97 year old
mother watching in Massachusets.

360
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,930
Mom, thank you for teaching me

361
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:45,240
about people and their stories,

362
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,871
you are the original
super hero, thank you.

363
00:20:48,871 --> 00:20:53,871
(applauding)
(gentle orchestral music)

364
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:57,280
- [Announcer] Coming up, Jennifer Lopez,

365
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,190

371
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:20,670

372

Turbotax free is free.

Free, free, free, free, free.

- Right?

397
00:23:05,256 --> 00:23:07,140
- These cheesy bacon fries are tremendous.

398
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,950
- I know, crispy bacon is the best thing

399
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,338
to ever happen to the fries.

400
00:23:10,338 --> 00:23:11,171
- (laughs) What?

401
00:23:11,171 --> 00:23:13,650
It's a fry show, McDonald's
world famous fries,

402
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:14,483
featuring bacon.

403
00:23:14,483 --> 00:23:16,550
- Or it is the crispy
bacon giving the fries

404
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,250
some street cred with
a whole new audience.

405
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,380
- I'm gonna let bacon think that.

406
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,213
- What was that?

407
00:23:20,213 --> 00:23:22,439
I couldn't hear you
over the bacon ovation.

408
00:23:22,439 --> 00:23:25,010
♪ Bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon ♪

409
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:26,580

410
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,630
only for a limited time.

411
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:29,420
Is it the best thing to
happen to our classics?

412
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,470
Order bacon, try for yourself and decide.

413
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:38,320
- [Man] To you, a filmmaker
of a future generation,

414
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,910
you and I, we're already
speaking to each other

415
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:43,650
from across time and I thought I'd

416
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,500
share this thought with you,

417
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,540
if you're burning to tell this story,

418
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:51,647
if you're seeing images and
passages in your mind's eye,

419
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:54,170
you have to make your movie.

420
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:56,040
You keep up your end of the conversation

421
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,340
and I'm looking forward to
hearing back from you soon.

422
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,940
Yours, Marty Scorsese.

423
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,050
- Good morning, friends.

424
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:07,400
I prayed with my mom
like five minutes ago.

425
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,960
She was like, go break a leg like you've

426
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,430
never braken it before.

legend of old McClenden

432
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:30,330
who battled the bulls on
the bank single handed?

433
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:33,090
Rose like the tides to defile Poseidon,

434
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:36,510
evading the waves as they
raged from his trident.

435
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:40,430
McClenden braved roadways
where most men won't wander

436
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:43,350
to rescue the runaways from
the headmasters monster.

437
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:48,440
I sure would have loved
to see her that fine hour,

438
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,040
perhaps catch a glimpse of
the source of her power.

- Yet you won't shout about it.

450
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,450
- Just not in your nature.

451
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:15,630

All right, New Orlean Jeremy.

510
00:28:15,011 --> 00:28:16,361
Okay, I gotta put these on.

511
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:18,960
I don't even know where I put my speech

512
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,780
cause I put it in the phone
and now I can't find it.

513
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:23,160
I'm really shaking hard.

514
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,619
Okay. (hyperventilating)

515

So an honor to be a part of that.

520

I want to thank the Academy,
thank you so much, Ryan Kugler.

(audience applauding)

522
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:49,210
I stand here stronger
than I was yesterday.

523
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:51,210
I stand here with agency and self-worth

524
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:55,220
because of Ryan Kugler
who not only made me

525

a better designer, a better
story teller, a better person.

526
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,370
I stand here because of this man

527
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:05,310
who offered me a different
perspective of life

528
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,550
who offered me a safe space,

529
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:10,780
who's patient and gave me
air, humanity and brotherhood.

530
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,760
Thank you, Ryan, I love you.

531
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,560
(applauding)

532
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,630
I'm stronger because of Marlon

533
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:20,050
who gave me the opportunity to do my best,

534
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,450
who supported the vision of this film

535
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:24,530
and lifted us up every day.

536
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:27,890
Victoria Alonzo, Keven
Fagey, Lou Despozito

537
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:30,860
and a man with the best
laugh ever, Nate Moore.

538
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,693
Thank you.

539
00:29:33,369 --> 00:29:34,820
And he was sparked stronger because of

540
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:37,190
the Hart department crew
who led with their hearts

541
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,790
and brought their experiences, talent,

542
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:41,380
courage, humility and
hard work to the table.

543
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,990
Supervising art director, Allan Hook

544
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,020
and set decorator, Jay Hart, thank you.

545
00:29:45,902 --> 00:29:47,960
I am stronger today because
of this wonderful cast,

546
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,630
who everyday, stepped into this world

547
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:51,430
and breathed life into it.

548
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:53,890
Because of Rue Carter and Rachel Morrison

549
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:57,100
and everything they did
behind the camera with me.

550
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:00,530
I'm stronger because of a woman who

551
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:02,600
supported me every day,

552
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,450
that I wanted to give up,
this is for you my friend,

553
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:09,570
Carole Trevino, rest in power. (crying)

554
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,300
I'm stronger because of
my family who supported me

555
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,380
through the roughest of times.

556
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,490
I give this strength to
all of those who come next

557
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:22,220
to keep going, to never give up

558
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,510
and when you think it's impossible,

559
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,560
just remember to say this peace of advice

560
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,280
I got from a very wise woman,

561
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,910
I did my best and my best is good enough.

562
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:30,798
Thank you.

563
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:35,798
(cheering)
(applauding)

564
00:30:35,885 --> 00:30:37,700
- [Jay] I just want to thank my crew.

565
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:54,380
- [Announcer] Please welcome Tyler Perry.

566
00:30:55,981 --> 00:30:58,398
(applauding)

567
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,740
- Community, we often
use that word to describe

568
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:16,090
who we are and what
connects all of us involved

569
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:17,990
in the different elements
that bring a film

570
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:20,460
from an idea in the writer's mind to

571
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,190
it's premier on the big screen.

572
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:24,270
Each person, each craft,

573
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:27,230
each discipline is
essential to that process.

574
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,560
Deep down, we know that.

575
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,320
We always have and in the end,

576
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,150
this truly collaborative community

577
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:34,150
comes together on a night like this

578
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:37,410
to celebrate this past year and
to look forward to the next.

579
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:40,910
It is a true honor for me
to present this next award

580
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:43,000
live on camera, not during
the commercial break,

581
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,390
thank you, academy. (laughs)

582
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:51,130

And the Oscar goes to,

589
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:22,680
(cheering)
(applauding)

590
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,320
- [Announcer] Alfonso
Cuaron is the forth person

591
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,370
to receive four nominations
in four different

592
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:30,940
award categories for the same film.

593
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:34,543
This is his third Oscar
and 10th nomination.

594
00:32:34,543 --> 00:32:38,210
(cheerful orchestral music)

595
00:32:44,688 --> 00:32:45,820
- Thank you.

596
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,700
Wow, thank you so much.

597
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,380
It's an amazing honor.

598
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,330
Thank you, Academy.

599
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,790
To create a single frame
of film, as you well know,

600
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,620
requires the work of a lot of people,

601
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:59,620
very hard work, so I want
to thank Galiza Palizo

602
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,580
and Marina Perida before anybody else.

603
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:06,130
The amazing cast and
crew, Gabriel Rodriguez,

604
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:09,450
Selma Bolacelias, producers,
participant of Netflix.

605
00:33:11,131 --> 00:33:14,420
Technicolor and every.

606
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:19,730
If this film was created
by my own memories,

607
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:22,580
the film was crafted through the memories

608
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:27,580
of what this great master
cinematography have given to us.

609
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:32,630
It's well known that
Billy Weidlers office,

610
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:36,350
there was a sign that said,
what would Ludwich have done?

611
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:41,030
And for me, it was what
would Chivo Woudeski

612
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:45,590
would have done, so this
is for you too Chivo

613
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:49,210
and thank you very much, Mexico,

614
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:54,210
to my family and Jonasbo
Guillermo, love you guys.

615
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,195
Thank you.

616
00:33:58,195 --> 00:34:03,195
(applauding)
(gentle orchestral music)

617
00:34:05,021 --> 00:34:06,560
- [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen,

618
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,930
please welcome Amelia Clark.

619
00:34:09,878 --> 00:34:12,295
(applauding)

620
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,660
- The first nominee for original song

621
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,150
was composed for the
documentary feature, RBG.

622
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,820
Sung as a rallying cry, an anthem

623
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,640
and a personal promise, the song embodies

624
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,400
the seemingly endless
strength and commitment

625
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,230
of its subject supreme court justice,

626
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:38,750
Ruth Bader Ginsberg, a woman
who has spent her career

627
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:42,500
at the forefront of the fight
against gender discrimination.

628
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,200
Khalisi has nothing on her.

629
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,180
Justice Ginsberg, if you'd ever
like to borrow the dragons,

630
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,013
ring me.

631
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:52,880
Although the song's
subject is soft spoken,

632
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,340
its singer is a vocal powerhouse,

633
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:58,600
presenting its message with
the passion it deserves,

634
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:02,730
and now performing I'll Fight
by song writer, Diane Warren,

635
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:06,014
please welcome Academy Award
winner, Jennifer Hudson.

855

Compassion is your best friend.

Say what you believe.

860
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:21,200
Your voice matters.

00:49:22,970 --> 00:49:23,803
Take action.

00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:26,740

- Hey.

867
00:49:41,628 --> 00:49:43,243
- [Man] Hey.

868
00:49:43,243 --> 00:49:46,420
- [Woman] We style the
stars behind the scenes

869
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:47,660
in Walmart fashion.

870
00:49:49,205 --> 00:49:50,270
- Do you have Brie?

871
00:49:50,270 --> 00:49:51,103
- [Woman] So cute.

872
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:52,780
- Best buds.

873
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:56,150
Wait, who's that blurred
out there in the background?

874
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:58,100
Did you boca my child?

875
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:00,490
- Um, it was totally unintentional.

876
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:01,723
- Why do you hate Jacob?

877
00:50:01,723 --> 00:50:03,180

878
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:07,040

Boca, unboca.

880
00:50:09,333 --> 00:50:10,166
- Wow.

881
00:50:12,403 --> 00:50:14,153
What kind of person boca's a child?

882
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:17,050
I would never boca your child.

883
00:50:18,563 --> 00:50:19,413
Just so you know.

884
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:22,650
- [Man] Jessica was in
bed when you got home.

885
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:24,520
- Yeah, she was sound asleep.

886
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,250
- So you didn't get into a fight?

887
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:27,083
- No.

888
00:50:27,083 --> 00:50:28,660
- When was the first time you hit Jessica?

889
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:29,660
- I didn't hit her, man.

890
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:31,260
Listen, I came in here
to help you guys out--

891
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:33,120
- Just hiding the beatings
til you knew she was leaving,

892
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:33,953
what?

893
00:50:33,953 --> 00:50:34,786
- You got a hearing problem?

894
00:50:34,786 --> 00:50:35,619
I told you I didn't hit her.

895
00:50:35,619 --> 00:50:36,520
Listen, where is all this coming from?

896
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:37,890
I came in here of my own volition.

897
00:50:37,890 --> 00:50:39,620
- Was she cheating on you?

898
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:40,453
- Piss off.

899
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:45,393
- Dammit.

900
00:50:57,016 --> 00:50:58,787
- Are you back there?

901
00:50:58,787 --> 00:51:01,230
Are you?

902
00:51:07,195 --> 00:51:09,695
You'll never not get me, Maya.

903
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:12,460
I'm an innocent man.

904
00:51:21,016 --> 00:51:22,569
(applauding)

905
00:51:22,569 --> 00:51:25,870
- [Announcer] Please welcome
Oscar nominated actress,

906
00:51:25,870 --> 00:51:27,010
Queen Latifa.

907
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:36,220
- It is an honor to be here to introduce

908
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:40,650
one of tonight's nominees for
best picture, The Favorite.

909
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:44,890
The film takes us to 18th century Britain

910
00:51:44,890 --> 00:51:47,780
with a monarch lacking
the interest and maybe

911
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:49,620
the ability to lead.

912
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:52,180
Decision making is taken
over by an inner circle

913
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:54,950
that's infighting for
the ruler's affection.

914
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:56,260
As the stakes get higher,

915
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:58,830
we see corruption lead to the downfall

916
00:51:58,830 --> 00:52:01,460
of one underling after another.

917
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:02,760
It's not easy being queen.

918
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:05,820
This is The Favorite.

919
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:08,830
- I hope you haven't found
your time with the queen

920
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:09,731
too tedious.

921
00:52:09,731 --> 00:52:11,170
(rings bell)
(screaming)

922
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:12,080
- She seems quite lovely.

923
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,170
- [Woman] The queen is
an extraordinary person.

924
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:15,180
- [Woman] You're so beautiful.

925
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:17,700
If I were a man, I would ravish you.

926
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:18,533
(screams)

927
00:52:18,533 --> 00:52:19,366
(laughing)

928
00:52:19,366 --> 00:52:20,199
- And stand up the other way.

929
00:52:20,199 --> 00:52:21,330
- You're jealous.

930
00:52:21,330 --> 00:52:22,810
- [Woman] She is a viper.
(slaps)

931
00:52:22,810 --> 00:52:25,380
- I am on my side, always.

932
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:26,700
- Stop it.

933
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:27,533
Stop!

934
00:52:27,533 --> 00:52:29,540
- [Woman] Oh it is fun
to be queen sometimes.

935
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:32,658
- [Woman] Do you actually
think you have won?

936
00:52:32,658 --> 00:52:33,759
- Why would I?

937
00:52:33,759 --> 00:52:35,220
- Take your shot.

938
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:38,099
(fires gun)
(splats)

939
00:52:38,099 --> 00:52:41,660
(applauding)
(cheerful orchestral music)

940
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:42,530
- [Announcer] Please welcome

941
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:45,919
Academy Award nominated
actress, Angela Basset

942
00:52:45,919 --> 00:52:50,919
and Academy Award winning
actor, Javier Bardem.

943
00:52:56,791 --> 00:53:00,624
(speaking a foreign language)

944
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:28,020
- Members of the movie academy

945
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:31,620
come from across the globe
so it is truly fitting

946
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:34,640
that this year, foreign language films

947
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:37,520
are not just recognized in this category,

948
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,860
but in almost every category.

949
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:42,380
- Exactly.

950
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:46,200
- Here are the nominees for
best foreign language film.

951
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:52,350

952
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:58,470

953
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:02,370

954
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:04,890

00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:25,286

959
00:54:25,286 --> 00:54:29,953

- [Announcer] This is the

961

962
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:42,248
for foreign language film.

963
00:54:42,248 --> 00:54:45,748

Am I going to get some

966
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:04,770
Well, thank you, Yaliza.

967
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:06,310
Thank you Marina.

968
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:10,060
Thank you Gabriela, Nico,
all the cast and crew.

969
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:12,800
I grew up watching

970
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:16,810
foreign language films and
learning so much from them

971
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:20,840
and being inspired,
films like Citizen Kane,

972
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:23,830
Jaws,
(audience laughing)

973
00:55:23,830 --> 00:55:28,100
Rashamon, The Godfather and Breathless.

974
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:34,210
When asked about the new wave,

975
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:38,310
Claude Sharolt said, there are no waves,

976
00:55:38,310 --> 00:55:40,050
there's only the ocean and I think that

977
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:44,660
the nominees tonight
have proven that we are

978
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:45,810
part of the same ocean.

979
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:52,490
I want to thank my family, Mexico,

980
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:56,770
for being the beach where
this film comes from

981
00:55:56,770 --> 00:56:01,770
and also to Ormo, Boo and
Hernanz to be the current

982
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:05,190
that pushes my drift.

983
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:06,689
Thank you so much.

984

This evening's next nominee
for best original song

991
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:49,250

Shaman and Scott Whitman

995
00:56:58,590 --> 00:57:00,910
Mary Poppins offers comfort and compassion

996
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:02,840
with this tender lullaby,

997
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:06,240
underscoring the notion
that a loved one who is lost

998
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,790
can still be very much present.

- [Man] To a future filmmaker,

1044
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:19,760
your film will speak to
many with a singular voice.

1045
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,790
Ask yourself what you have to say,

1046
01:01:22,790 --> 01:01:25,430
and then say it in ways
that are unique to you.

1047
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:27,940
Recognize when lightening strikes

1048
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:30,130
even if it's not what you planned.

1049
01:01:30,130 --> 01:01:32,170
Always stay humble before the craft.

1050
01:01:32,170 --> 01:01:34,240
And the most important thing,

1051
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:35,800
pick up a camera and get going.

1052
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:37,790
Now you're a filmmaker.

(gentle orchestral music)
(audience applauding)

1105
01:04:11,970 --> 01:04:15,140
- Black Panther may be an African hero,

1106
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:18,440
but his story and his
appeal are universal.

1107
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:20,390
I know this personally
because of all the people

Waconda forever.

1112
01:04:28,910 --> 01:04:31,050
In France, I've had people
say, Hello Trevor Noah,

1113
01:04:31,050 --> 01:04:33,090
you say Waconda forever, no?

1114
01:04:33,090 --> 01:04:35,300

Waconda forever.

1116

01:04:47,610 --> 01:04:50,827
and he would remind me
of a great Cossa phrase,

1122
01:04:50,827 --> 01:04:52,850
(speaking foreign language)

1123
01:04:52,850 --> 01:04:54,510
which means, in times like these,

1124
01:04:54,510 --> 01:04:56,380
we are stronger when we fight together

1125
01:04:56,380 --> 01:04:58,390
than when we try to fight apart.

1126
01:04:58,390 --> 01:05:00,590
This is best picture
nominee, Black Panther.

1127
01:05:01,649 --> 01:05:06,316
(cheering)
(applauding)

1128
01:05:07,169 --> 01:05:09,937
- [Man] I know that we have
the right king, (inaudible).

1129
01:05:09,937 --> 01:05:12,457
(screaming)
(shattering glass)

1130
01:05:12,457 --> 01:05:13,407
- You're a good man

1131
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:15,370
with a good heart

1132
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:18,010
and it's hard for a good man

1133
01:05:19,798 --> 01:05:20,777
to be king.

1134
01:05:20,777 --> 01:05:22,467
(battle cry)

1135
01:05:22,467 --> 01:05:23,956
(whooshing)

1136
01:05:23,956 --> 01:05:26,000
- The black panther lives.

1137
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,080
- [Woman] You get to
decide what kind of king

1138
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:29,880
you are going to be.

1139
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:30,780
- Waconda forever!

1140
01:05:31,711 --> 01:05:33,878
- [Group] Waconda forever!

1141
01:05:34,930 --> 01:05:37,347
(applauding)

1142
01:05:39,379 --> 01:05:42,430
- [Announcer] Please welcome
Oscar nominated actor,

1143
01:05:42,430 --> 01:05:43,919
Michael Keaton.

1144
01:05:43,919 --> 01:05:47,419
(gentle orchestral music)

1145
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:57,070
- If you think of shooting
a movie and making a movie

1146
01:05:57,070 --> 01:05:59,430
as the same thing,
you've overlooked one of

1147
01:05:59,430 --> 01:06:03,740
the most important elements
of film making, the editing.

1148
01:06:03,740 --> 01:06:05,860
Editors infuse a film with rhythm,

1149
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:08,490
they build suspense
and they create moments

1150
01:06:08,490 --> 01:06:10,760
that otherwise would not have existed

1151
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:14,030
and as an actor, they can make things

1152
01:06:14,030 --> 01:06:18,378
like your performance a
whole lot better, trust me.

1153
01:06:18,378 --> 01:06:19,960
(audience laughing)

1154
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:23,080
And here are the nominees for
achievement in film editing.

1155
01:06:24,830 --> 01:06:27,410
Black Klansman, Barry Alexander Brown.

1156
01:06:28,650 --> 01:06:30,650
Bohemian Rhapsody, John Ottman.

1157
01:06:32,010 --> 01:06:34,280
The Favorite, Yorgos Mavropsaridis.

1158
01:06:35,630 --> 01:06:37,770
Green Book, Patrick J. Don Vito.

1159
01:06:38,910 --> 01:06:40,420
Vice, Hank Corwin.

1160
01:06:44,630 --> 01:06:47,810
And the Oscar goes to,

1161
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:51,387
Bohemian Rhapsody, John Ottman.

1162
01:06:51,387 --> 01:06:53,900
(cheering)
(applauding)

1163
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:56,630
- [Announcer] This is the
first Oscar and nomination

1164
01:06:56,630 --> 01:06:58,279
for John Ottman.

1165
01:06:58,279 --> 01:07:01,779
(orchestra playing Queen)

1166
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,420
- He just asked if I would
like this and I said,

1167
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:17,790
sure, my mom would like it, who is here.

1168
01:07:17,790 --> 01:07:19,340
Over there, she's 85 years old.

1169
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:25,100
Wow, you get up here and
you completely blank.

1170
01:07:26,470 --> 01:07:28,310
This film, I always like to say,

1171
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:30,600
the entire cast and
crew like to always say,

1172
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:34,060
was a labor of love and
I think Freddie Mercury,

1173
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:35,860
in a way, kind of brought us all together

1174
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:39,400
from wherever he is and,
just like he did his audience

1175
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:43,620
and I just am so thankful
for everyone bonding together

1176
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:45,980
and supporting each other and trusting me

1177
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:49,690
and I want to, there's too
many people to thank of course.

1178
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:51,880
I'm looking at Rami (mumbles)
right looking at me,

1179
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:54,260
better thank me. (laughs)

1180
01:07:55,308 --> 01:07:57,230
Got the band over here,
thank you so much, Brian May

1181
01:07:57,230 --> 01:08:00,220
and Roger Taylor and not to mention,

1182
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:03,650
of course, Graham King
and Dennis O'Sullivan,

1183
01:08:03,650 --> 01:08:05,670
two of the hardest working
and committed producers

1184
01:08:05,670 --> 01:08:07,240
I've ever worked with my life

1185
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:09,730
and lastly, this goes to my parents

1186
01:08:09,730 --> 01:08:12,028
on their fireplace mantle because

1187
01:08:12,028 --> 01:08:14,290
they encouraged me to do
whatever I wanted to do

1188
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:17,070
when I was a kid whether
it was writing music,

1189
01:08:17,070 --> 01:08:20,020
which was a mystery to them or
making films in their garage

1190
01:08:20,020 --> 01:08:22,070
on Nominator Way in San Jose, California.

1191
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:26,380
So as Freddie's father would say,

1192
01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:28,639
good thoughts, good words,
good deeds, thank you.

1193
01:08:28,639 --> 01:08:33,639
(applauding)
(cheerful orchestral music)

1194
01:08:33,890 --> 01:08:35,770
- [Announcer] Please welcome, Daniel Craig

1195
01:08:35,770 --> 01:08:39,210
and Academy Award winner, Charlise Theron.

1196
01:08:39,210 --> 01:08:41,627
(applauding)

1197
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:52,930
- As actors, we show up, we work hard

1198
01:08:52,930 --> 01:08:55,880
and hopefully we take our job seriously

1199
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:58,030
without taking ourselves too seriously.

1200
01:08:58,910 --> 01:08:59,820
(clears throat) And seriously,

1201
01:08:59,820 --> 01:09:01,420
Charlise Theron can kick my ass.

1202
01:09:02,410 --> 01:09:04,600
We aspire to transform ourselves

1203
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:07,530
into the characters we
play and to transport

1204
01:09:07,530 --> 01:09:09,980
the movie goer in the process.

1205
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:13,000
- Among a sea of brilliant
performances each year,

1206
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,810
certain of them stand
out for their artistry,

1207
01:09:15,810 --> 01:09:18,820
their honesty, and the
masterful choices made

1208
01:09:18,820 --> 01:09:20,450
in interpreting their role.

1209
01:09:20,450 --> 01:09:22,480
We honor those individuals tonight.

1210
01:09:23,490 --> 01:09:25,710
- Here are the nominees
for performance by an actor

1211
01:09:25,710 --> 01:09:28,750
in a supporting role.

1212
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:31,250
Mahershala Ali, Green Book.

1213
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:33,530
- I just put the Attorney
General of the United States

1214
01:09:33,530 --> 01:09:34,960
in an incredibly awkward position.

1215
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:37,740
- So what, that's what
the guy gets paid for.

1216
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:39,550
What else does he got to do?

1217
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:41,760
- That man and his brother

1218
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:43,110
are trying to change this country.

1219
01:09:43,110 --> 01:09:44,610
That's what else he got to do.

1220
01:09:46,410 --> 01:09:47,960
Now he thinks I'm some kind of,

1221
01:09:50,050 --> 01:09:52,940
calling from some backwoods swamp jail

1222
01:09:52,940 --> 01:09:56,270
asking to attenuate assault
charges, who does that?

1223
01:09:56,270 --> 01:09:57,730
Garbage, that's who.

1224
01:09:58,859 --> 01:10:01,276
(applauding)

1225
01:10:02,830 --> 01:10:04,780
- [Daniel] Adam Driver, Black Klansman.

1226
01:10:06,210 --> 01:10:10,150
- I'm Jewish, yes, but
I wasn't raised to be.

1227
01:10:10,150 --> 01:10:11,440
It wasn't part of my life,

1228
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:14,770
I never thought much about being Jewish,

1229
01:10:14,770 --> 01:10:16,090
nobody around me was Jewish.

1230
01:10:16,090 --> 01:10:18,440
You know, I wasn't going
to a bunch of bar mitzvahs.

1231
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:20,550
I didn't have a bar mitzvah.

1232
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:22,550
I was just another white kid

1233
01:10:22,550 --> 01:10:24,900
and now I'm in some
basement, denying out loud.

1234
01:10:25,769 --> 01:10:27,838
(chuckling)

1235
01:10:27,838 --> 01:10:30,255
(applauding)

1236
01:10:31,780 --> 01:10:34,600
- [Daniel] Sam Elliott, A Star Is Born.

1237
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:35,700
- It ain't your fault.

1238
01:10:37,910 --> 01:10:38,743
It just isn't.

1239
01:10:40,030 --> 01:10:41,430
You know whose fault it was?

1240
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:43,233
Jack.

1241
01:10:46,330 --> 01:10:47,163
That's it.

1242
01:10:48,081 --> 01:10:48,914
No one else.

1243
01:10:50,350 --> 01:10:52,767
(applauding)

1244
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:57,920
- [Daniel] Richard E. Grant,
Can You Ever Forgive Me?

1245
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,740
- She not here anymore, she died.

1246
01:10:59,740 --> 01:11:01,240
- She did?

1247
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:02,540
That's young.

1248
01:11:02,540 --> 01:11:03,870
- Maybe she didn't die,

1249
01:11:03,870 --> 01:11:06,590
maybe she just moved back to the suburbs.

1250
01:11:06,590 --> 01:11:08,150
I always confuse those two.

1251
01:11:08,150 --> 01:11:11,390
That's right, she got
married and had twins.

1252
01:11:11,390 --> 01:11:12,460
- Better to have died.

1253
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:13,293
- Indeed.

1254
01:11:14,179 --> 01:11:16,596
(applauding)

1255
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:20,700
- [Daniel] Sam Rockwell, Vice.

1256
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:23,370
- You're one of the most
experience guys around, you and I.

1257
01:11:23,370 --> 01:11:24,820
Jump on board and be my vice?

1258
01:11:26,380 --> 01:11:27,260
- I'm honored.

1259
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:30,630
- Don't be honored, say
yes, Mr. Brass Tacks.

1260
01:11:30,630 --> 01:11:32,320
- I'll have to say uh, no.

1261
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:35,698
- Dick, come on, we'll have a lot of fun.

1262
01:11:35,698 --> 01:11:37,450
What are you doing right now?

1263
01:11:37,450 --> 01:11:38,859
You in the private sector?

1264
01:11:38,859 --> 01:11:40,030
- [Dick] Yeah.

1265
01:11:40,030 --> 01:11:42,180
- Come on, I know you love politics.

1266
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:43,810
- No George.

1267
01:11:43,810 --> 01:11:44,643
- Let's go.

1268
01:11:44,643 --> 01:11:46,030
- [Dick] Not gonna happen.

1269
01:11:46,030 --> 01:11:49,120
- Come on now. (chuckling)

1270
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:51,537
(applauding)

1271
01:11:55,757 --> 01:11:58,170
- And the Oscar goes to,

1272
01:11:58,170 --> 01:11:59,826
Mahershala Ali.

1273
01:11:59,826 --> 01:12:02,980
(cheering)
(applauding)

1274
01:12:02,980 --> 01:12:04,780
- [Announcer] This is the second Oscar

1275
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:07,110
and second nomination for Mahershala Ali.

1276
01:12:08,030 --> 01:12:10,710
He took home his first
Oscar in this category

1277
01:12:10,710 --> 01:12:12,016
for Moonlight.

1278
01:12:12,016 --> 01:12:15,683
(cheerful orchestral music)

1279
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:26,950
- Academy, thank you.

1280
01:12:29,376 --> 01:12:30,926
I want to thank Dr. Shirley for

1281
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:34,330
just trying to capture his essence.

1282
01:12:36,957 --> 01:12:39,400
Trying to capture Dr. Shirley's essence

1283
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:43,870
pushed me to my, my ends and um,

1284
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:46,750
which is a reflection of the person he was

1285
01:12:46,750 --> 01:12:49,050
and the life that he
lived and I thank him.

1286
01:12:51,350 --> 01:12:52,900
I thank my partner, Vigo,

1287
01:12:53,910 --> 01:12:56,016
extraordinary working with you.

1288

1289
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:01,990
Peter Fairly, I thank
you for your leadership

1290
01:13:01,990 --> 01:13:06,990

for also giving us space,

1291
01:13:07,570 --> 01:13:10,000

1292

I want to dedicate this to my grandmother

1298
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:31,790
who has been in my ear my entire life,

1299
01:13:31,790 --> 01:13:33,930
telling me that, if at
first I don't succeed,

1300
01:13:33,930 --> 01:13:37,810
try, try again, that I could
do anything I put my mind to,

1301
01:13:39,630 --> 01:13:42,920
always, always pushing
me to think positively

1302
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:45,370
and I know that I would
not be here without her,

1303
01:13:45,370 --> 01:13:47,910
that she has got me over the
hump every step of the way.

1313
01:14:17,990 --> 01:14:20,750

1314
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:24,450
from the magic of Singapore
to the mysteries of Africa,

1315

1344
01:16:04,910 --> 01:16:09,905

1345

(applauding)
(cheerful orchestral music)

1346
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:20,830
- Growing up in Los Angeles,

1347
01:16:20,830 --> 01:16:23,240
can you believe it was only a dream

1348
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:24,620
that there would ever be a place

1349
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:27,910
where people could go
to immerse themselves

1350
01:16:27,910 --> 01:16:31,180
in the passion and magic of movies?

1351
01:16:31,180 --> 01:16:34,320
Even as a child of
actors, there was nothing,

1352
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:36,320
trust me, but guess what?

1353
01:16:37,230 --> 01:16:39,420
The dream is happening.

1354
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:45,960
When we enter the new Academy
Museum of Motion Pictures,

1355
01:16:46,134 --> 01:16:49,360
(audience applauding)

1356
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:51,730
we will open a door and walk

1357
01:16:51,730 --> 01:16:54,430
into the technicolor land of Oz.

1358
01:16:54,430 --> 01:16:58,070
We will travel through the
animated world of Miazaki,

1359
01:16:58,070 --> 01:17:00,540
perhaps encounter the shark from Jaws,

1360
01:17:00,540 --> 01:17:03,160
and see the ruby red slippers.

1361
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:07,670
The dream is a reality, not
just for the child in me,

1362
01:17:07,670 --> 01:17:11,530
but for all of us from all
around the world, coming soon.

and producer, Ferrell Williams.

1366
01:17:21,566 --> 01:17:25,066
(gentle orchestral music)

1367
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:33,870
- The Bible says, when I was a child,

1368
01:17:33,870 --> 01:17:37,780
I spoke as a child, I
understood as a child,

1369
01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:41,540
I thought as a child
and when I became a man,

1370
01:17:41,540 --> 01:17:42,950
I put away childish things.

1371
01:17:43,990 --> 01:17:45,900
- When we move through adulthood,

1372
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:49,070
we look back fondly on
those simpler times,

1373
01:17:49,070 --> 01:17:52,750
the creativity we
exhibited, our fearlessness,

1374
01:17:52,750 --> 01:17:55,160
how we approached new things with wonder.

1375
01:17:57,460 --> 01:17:59,900
- The films nominated
for best animated feature

1376
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:02,750
possess the ability to move us all.

1377
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:04,780
No need to put things away,

1378
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:09,780
but instead embrace and
enjoy a shared experience.

1379

- Thank you Sony.

1408
01:19:35,630 --> 01:19:39,560
We share this with our fellow producers,

1409
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:43,070
cast, crew, there's 800 filmmakers

1410
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:46,340
who push boundaries and
took risks to make people

1411
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:49,830
feel powerful and seen.

1412
01:19:50,810 --> 01:19:53,580
- So when we hear that somebody,

1413
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:55,640
somebody's kid was watching the movie

1414
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:59,410
and turned to them and
said, he looks like me,

1415
01:19:59,410 --> 01:20:04,080
or they speak Spanish like us,
we feel like we already won.

1416
01:20:05,417 --> 01:20:07,400
(audience applauding)

- The Ballad of Buster
Scrugs brought new life

1433
01:21:07,270 --> 01:21:10,240
into westerns with its mix of satire,

1434
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:13,450
sentiment, realism and romance.

1435
01:21:13,450 --> 01:21:14,910
All of these qualities are on display

1436
01:21:14,910 --> 01:21:16,730
in this haunting song.

1437
01:21:16,730 --> 01:21:18,410

I'm having a panic attack.

1621
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:51,520
- I am so scared.

1622
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,900
Why am I so scared right now?

1623

01:31:06,620 --> 01:31:08,220
that I find embarrassing.

1632
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:12,640
- Yeah, who were you most nervous to see?

1633
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:13,860
Because when I walked out,

1634
01:31:13,860 --> 01:31:15,710
I saw Spike Lee and I was like, what?

1635
01:31:17,150 --> 01:31:17,983
- That's what you said?

1636
01:31:17,983 --> 01:31:22,020

like, hey Spike. (chuckles)

Do you know who I saw,

1640
01:31:27,430 --> 01:31:29,140
and I legit freaked out?

1642
01:31:30,450 --> 01:31:31,550

1643
01:31:31,550 --> 01:31:33,050
- Yeah, that's why it's weird.

who hide behind their sketchbooks,

1674

don't be afraid to tell
your stories to the world.

You're gonna freak people out,

that was about a mother
just as I was becoming one,

1693
01:34:05,430 --> 01:34:08,780
so to my little bao, Lucy, and to Deanne,

Please welcome Diego Luna
and Chef Jose Andres.

1817
01:41:40,897 --> 01:41:43,676
- Bueno noches a todos.

1818
01:41:43,676 --> 01:41:44,785
(laughing)

1819
01:41:44,785 --> 01:41:47,476
(speaking Spanish)

1820
01:41:47,476 --> 01:41:49,646

- So, people of the world,

1823
01:41:59,126 --> 01:42:04,097
each person's life is a
recipe all on its own,

1824
01:42:04,097 --> 01:42:07,390
with different measures
of joy and sadness,

1825
01:42:07,390 --> 01:42:11,630
struggle and success, love and loss.

1826
01:42:11,630 --> 01:42:14,570
The results are unique every time

1827
01:42:14,570 --> 01:42:19,040
even though all of the
ingredients are universal.

1828
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:22,620
- In Roma, Alphonso Corron
presents and honest and vital

1829
01:42:22,620 --> 01:42:25,600
portrait of the Mexico
city of his childhood,

1830
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:28,810
a place full of contrast
and contradictions.

1831
01:42:28,810 --> 01:42:32,090
This is a story of lonely
women and absent men,

1832
01:42:33,530 --> 01:42:37,100
of painful class divisions
and racial dynamics,

1833
01:42:37,100 --> 01:42:39,390
but love is where everyone meets.

1834
01:42:40,350 --> 01:42:43,730
- And this beautiful intimate film,

1835
01:42:43,730 --> 01:42:46,940
one that gives a voice to the voiceless

1836
01:42:46,940 --> 01:42:50,780
reminds us of the
understanding and compassion

1837
01:42:50,780 --> 01:42:54,250
that we all owe to the invisible people

1838
01:42:54,250 --> 01:42:57,960
in our lives, immigrants and women

1839
01:42:59,110 --> 01:43:01,561
who move humanity forward.

1840
01:43:01,561 --> 01:43:03,978

1841
01:43:11,913 --> 01:43:14,830

(cheerful orchestral music)
(applauding)

1850
01:44:09,490 --> 01:44:11,950
- In Duck Soup, Chico Marks asks,

1851
01:44:11,950 --> 01:44:14,980
who are you going to
believe, me or your own eyes?

1852
01:44:14,980 --> 01:44:16,880
When it comes to visual effects,

1853
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:18,590
the answer is not so simple.

1854
01:44:18,590 --> 01:44:20,450
- Today's effects artists collaborate

1855
01:44:20,450 --> 01:44:23,010
with every other department
to convince audiences

1856
01:44:23,010 --> 01:44:25,570
of even the most implausible realities.

1857
01:44:25,570 --> 01:44:27,580
This is the kind of magic
that allows the audience

1858
01:44:27,580 --> 01:44:28,850
to believe I was actually

1859
01:44:28,850 --> 01:44:31,310
obliterated by a truck in Bird Box.

1860
01:44:31,310 --> 01:44:33,400
- And the same kind of magic
that allows an audience

1861
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:35,549
to believe that I am an actor.

1862
01:44:35,549 --> 01:44:37,799
(laughing)

1863
01:44:39,150 --> 01:44:40,510

- Oh my goodness, okay.

1885
01:46:08,990 --> 01:46:11,950
What a truly magnificent
moment, putting things

1886
01:46:11,950 --> 01:46:14,050
a little bit differently on
First Man so being recognized

1887
01:46:14,050 --> 01:46:16,050

1888

01:57:59,110 --> 01:58:00,610

01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:03,200
so glad you're sitting down.

(laughing)

2073
01:58:21,359 --> 01:58:23,320
- And now to get back on script,

2074
01:58:23,320 --> 01:58:26,680
the legendary filmmaker, Frank Capra said,

2075
01:58:26,680 --> 01:58:29,740
script writing is the toughest
part of the whole racket,

2076
01:58:29,740 --> 01:58:32,300
the least understood
and the least noticed.

2077
01:58:32,300 --> 01:58:34,610
- Uh no, uh, we notice.

2078
01:58:34,610 --> 01:58:35,443
- Of course.

2079
01:58:35,443 --> 01:58:37,810
- Trust me, we notice.
- 100%.

2080
01:58:37,810 --> 01:58:39,930
- Bri and I don't show up on a movie set

2081
01:58:39,930 --> 01:58:41,770
and ad lib for 12 hours.

2082
01:58:41,770 --> 01:58:43,450
- Sometimes.
- We're not winging it.

2083
01:58:43,450 --> 01:58:46,030
We're not winging it, we
need words, we need words.

2084
01:58:46,030 --> 01:58:46,863
- Yeah.

2085
01:58:46,863 --> 01:58:48,460
- Which is why we truly appreciate

2086
01:58:48,460 --> 01:58:50,520
what the late, great William Goldman said

2087
01:58:50,520 --> 01:58:54,500
about his craft, the latest, (laughing)

2088
01:58:54,500 --> 01:58:58,700
the easiest thing to do
on Earth is to not write.

2089
01:58:58,700 --> 01:58:59,613
- Truth.

2090
01:58:59,613 --> 01:59:01,280
(audience laughing)

2091

and brought to Jamestown,
Virginia, enslaved.

who was a Spellman College graduate

2191
02:04:42,460 --> 02:04:44,210
even though her mother was a slave.

2192
02:04:45,160 --> 02:04:48,270
My grandmother who saved 50
years of social security checks

2193
02:04:48,270 --> 02:04:51,520
to put her first grandchild,
she called me Spikeypoo.

02:05:05,550 --> 02:05:08,550
who helped built this
country and was today

2198
02:05:08,550 --> 02:05:11,450
along with the genocide
of his native people.

2199
02:05:12,350 --> 02:05:14,750
We all connect with our ancestors.

2200
02:05:14,750 --> 02:05:16,840
We will have love, wisdom regained,

2201
02:05:16,840 --> 02:05:18,180
we will regain our humanity.

2202
02:05:18,180 --> 02:05:20,330
It will be a powerful moment.

2203
02:05:20,330 --> 02:05:23,620
The 2020 presidential
election is around the corner.

2204
02:05:27,190 --> 02:05:28,670
Let's all mobilize.

between love versus hate.

02:06:24,240 --> 02:06:25,460
and then back to city college

2222
02:06:25,460 --> 02:06:26,980
and then maybe you pull yourself up--

2223
02:06:26,980 --> 02:06:27,840
- [Woman] You lift has arrived.

2224
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:30,128
- Everybody to do everything-- (screaming)

2225
02:06:30,128 --> 02:06:32,202
♪ Aye oh, let's go ♪

2226
02:06:32,202 --> 02:06:35,550
♪ Aye oh, let's go ♪

2227
02:06:35,550 --> 02:06:36,980
- I can't believe it.

2228
02:06:36,980 --> 02:06:38,926
- That there's a lobster in our hot tub?

2229
02:06:38,926 --> 02:06:41,640
- Oh, you guys, there's a jet.

2230
02:06:42,560 --> 02:06:44,940
Oh, I needed this.

2231
02:06:44,940 --> 02:06:46,320
- No, I can't believe how easy it was

2232
02:06:46,320 --> 02:06:48,320
to save hundreds of dollars on
our car insurance with Geico.

2233
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:49,960
We could have been doing
this a long time ago.

2234
02:06:49,960 --> 02:06:51,230
- So are you guys staying at the hotel?

2235
02:06:51,230 --> 02:06:52,390
- Yeah, we just got married.

2236

2238
02:06:54,720 --> 02:06:56,990
- Yeah, I'm afraid of commitment.

2239
02:06:56,990 --> 02:06:58,970
You know and being boiled alive.

2240
02:06:58,970 --> 02:06:59,803
Oh shoot. (splashing)

2241
02:06:59,803 --> 02:07:02,160
- [Man] Believe it, Geico
could save you 15% or more

2242
02:07:02,160 --> 02:07:03,420
on car insurance.
(gasping)

2243
02:07:03,420 --> 02:07:05,171
- [Lobster] That guy is the worst.

2244
02:07:05,171 --> 02:07:08,760
(gentle orchestral music)

2245
02:07:08,760 --> 02:07:13,760
- [Radio] Hey, we need an assist.

2246
02:07:14,160 --> 02:07:15,140

in Walmart fashion.

2249
02:07:18,870 --> 02:07:20,538
- Hey, when's lunch?

2250
02:07:20,538 --> 02:07:21,560
- Here it is.

2251
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:25,270
Show me the money.

2252
02:07:25,270 --> 02:07:27,057
- [Siri] Here you go.

2253
02:07:27,057 --> 02:07:29,307
(screaming)

2254
02:07:29,307 --> 02:07:32,000
- Yo, doesn't it make you
feel good just to say that?

2255
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,310
Say it with me one time.

2256
02:07:35,503 --> 02:07:38,300
- [Announcer] The Oscars
will continue in a moment

2259
02:07:47,411 --> 02:07:49,980
- [Woman] The unknown beyond the horizon

2260
02:07:49,980 --> 02:07:51,680
that was once our frontier.

2261
02:07:54,130 --> 02:07:57,500
But today, a new frontier has risen

2262
02:07:57,500 --> 02:08:01,090
and this is the vehicle
crafted to conquer it.

2266
02:08:11,040 --> 02:08:13,184
- [Woman] Everyone's gotta listen to mom.

2267
02:08:13,184 --> 02:08:15,080
When it comes to reducing the sugar

2268
02:08:15,080 --> 02:08:19,220
in your family's diet, Coke,
Dr. Pepper and Pepsi hear you

2269
02:08:19,220 --> 02:08:21,510
and we're working
together to do just that,

2270
02:08:21,510 --> 02:08:23,550
bringing you more great tasting beverages

2271
02:08:23,550 --> 02:08:25,790
with less sugar or no sugar at all.

2272
02:08:25,790 --> 02:08:27,410
Smaller portion sizes.

2273
02:08:29,090 --> 02:08:33,450
Clear calorie labels and
reminders to think balance

2274
02:08:33,450 --> 02:08:36,210
because we know mom wants what's best.

2275
02:08:36,210 --> 02:08:39,400
More beverage choices,
smaller portions, less sugar,

balaceUS.org.

2277
02:08:41,860 --> 02:08:43,720
- [Woman] You, all of you,

2278
02:08:44,660 --> 02:08:48,040
how you live, what you love,

2279
02:08:48,040 --> 02:08:49,460
that's what inspired us to create

2280
02:08:49,460 --> 02:08:51,700
America's most advanced Internet,

2281
02:08:51,700 --> 02:08:53,410
Internet that puts you in charge,

2282
02:08:55,590 --> 02:08:57,090
that protects what's important

2283
02:08:58,872 --> 02:09:02,770
and handles everything
and reaches everywhere.

2284
02:09:02,770 --> 02:09:04,550
This is beyond wi-fi.

2285
02:09:04,550 --> 02:09:06,150
This is X-fi.

2286
02:09:06,150 --> 02:09:10,930
Simple, easy, awesome,
Xfinity, the future of awesome.

2287
02:09:10,930 --> 02:09:13,380
- [Man] It's a deadly blind
spot right under your nose,

2288
02:09:13,380 --> 02:09:14,730
tonight after the Oscars.

2289
02:09:17,750 --> 02:09:19,270
- [Announcer] Welcome back to the Oscars

2293
02:09:30,260 --> 02:09:32,980

and Michael B. Jordan.

2295
02:09:35,633 --> 02:09:38,050
(applauding)

2296
02:09:46,750 --> 02:09:48,890
- The score served as
a musical through-line

2297
02:09:48,890 --> 02:09:51,860
that impacts our feelings
in any given scene.

2298
02:09:51,860 --> 02:09:55,003
- Like when we hear this
Oscar winning score.

2299
02:09:55,003 --> 02:09:57,836
(Jaws theme song)

2300
02:09:58,880 --> 02:10:00,420
- I know it's time to take
my ass out of the water

2301
02:10:00,420 --> 02:10:04,230
because probably something bad
is gonna happen in the ocean.

2302
02:10:04,230 --> 02:10:05,960
- But wait, you can swim, right?

2303
02:10:05,960 --> 02:10:07,150
- Yeah, why would you ask me that?

2304
02:10:07,150 --> 02:10:08,540
- Just cause unfortunately a lot of people

2305
02:10:08,540 --> 02:10:09,820
don't know that about us.

2306
02:10:09,820 --> 02:10:11,070
- Ah, touche, touche.

2307
02:10:11,960 --> 02:10:14,083
Or uh, how about when we hear this.

2308
02:10:14,083 --> 02:10:17,142
(Titanic theme music)

2309
02:10:17,142 --> 02:10:17,975
That's good, right?

2310
02:10:20,350 --> 02:10:23,010
- We know people are going to fall in love

2311
02:10:23,010 --> 02:10:25,820
before something else
bad happens in the ocean.

2312
02:10:28,080 --> 02:10:30,980
A great score moves us as an audience.

2313
02:10:31,910 --> 02:10:34,130
- While reminding us
that really bad things

2314
02:10:34,130 --> 02:10:36,243
can happen in the ocean.

2315
02:10:36,243 --> 02:10:37,790

an incredible honor.

2334
02:12:13,870 --> 02:12:16,500
I remember 12 years ago we
were sitting in our dorm

2335
02:12:16,500 --> 02:12:18,790
at USC writing your first,

and we're here 12 years later,

2338
02:12:22,930 --> 02:12:26,360
you know, celebrating
one of the most important

2339
02:12:26,360 --> 02:12:28,790
cinematic moments in history.

2340
02:12:30,604 --> 02:12:34,350
I want to share this award
with all the incredible

2341
02:12:34,350 --> 02:12:36,620

musicians in London that
recorded on the score

2344

and everyone else I want
to share this award with

2345
02:12:48,705 --> 02:12:51,410
my mom and dad and sister.

2346

They insisted I play
guitar and my wife, Serena.

2347

The only thing these songs

2357
02:13:33,040 --> 02:13:35,040

2390
02:15:26,640 --> 02:15:30,000
Thank you so much to the Academy
for this wonderful honor.

2391
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,090
Thank you to every single
person in this room.

2392
02:15:32,090 --> 02:15:35,100
Thank you to Mark Ronson,
to Anthony Rossomando,

2393
02:15:35,100 --> 02:15:38,340
to Andrew Wyatt, my co-writers,
I love them so much.

2394
02:15:38,340 --> 02:15:41,150
To my sister, my soulmate, I love you.

2395
02:15:42,070 --> 02:15:42,989
My family's here.

2396
02:15:42,989 --> 02:15:44,780
I love you mom and dad.

2397
02:15:44,780 --> 02:15:48,430
Bradley, there is not a
single person on the planet

2398
02:15:48,430 --> 02:15:51,520
that could've sang this
song with me, but you.

2399
02:15:51,520 --> 02:15:52,890
Thank you for believing in us.

2400
02:15:52,890 --> 02:15:54,497
Thank you so much.

2401
02:15:54,497 --> 02:15:55,668
(applauding)

2402
02:15:55,668 --> 02:15:59,800
If you are at home and
you're sitting on your couch

2403
02:15:59,800 --> 02:16:01,960
and you are watching this right now,

2404
02:16:01,960 --> 02:16:04,800
all I have to say is
that this is hard work.

2405
02:16:04,800 --> 02:16:06,840
I've worked hard for a long time

2406
02:16:06,840 --> 02:16:08,630
and it's not about, you know,

2407
02:16:10,460 --> 02:16:14,670
it's not about winning,
but what it's about

2408
02:16:14,670 --> 02:16:15,970
is not giving up.

2409
02:16:15,970 --> 02:16:18,200
If you have a dream, fight for it.

2410
02:16:18,200 --> 02:16:20,900
If there's a discipline for passion

2411
02:16:20,900 --> 02:16:23,530
and it's not about how
many times you get rejected

2412
02:16:23,530 --> 02:16:25,790
or fought you fall down
or you're beaten up,

2413
02:16:25,790 --> 02:16:28,130
it's about how many times you stand up

2414
02:16:28,130 --> 02:16:29,950
and are brave and you keep on going.

2415
02:16:29,950 --> 02:16:30,783
Thank you.

2416
02:16:35,520 --> 02:16:38,760
- Only because you can't
really thank yourself,

2417
02:16:38,760 --> 02:16:40,390
I think when you're in
the room with this person,

2418
02:16:40,390 --> 02:16:41,830
you don't really have to do too much,

2419
02:16:41,830 --> 02:16:44,170
so she acts, she writes,
she sings the song,

2420
02:16:44,170 --> 02:16:47,492
Lady Gaga, we salute
you, thank you for this.

2421
02:16:47,492 --> 02:16:49,909

but all 212 nominees of the
Academies class of 2018.

2429
02:17:34,110 --> 02:17:37,167
We also pause to honor all those artists

2430
02:17:37,167 --> 02:17:40,090
who have left us since
our last awards ceremony,

2431
02:17:41,080 --> 02:17:45,060
the men and women whose
movies have so entertained

2432
02:17:45,060 --> 02:17:46,270
and inspired us.

2433
02:17:47,410 --> 02:17:50,250
Only a few of them can
be highlighted here,

2434
02:17:50,250 --> 02:17:52,530
but let's now give tribute

2435
02:17:52,530 --> 02:17:55,040

of good for the world.

2450

potential to do so much more.

2451
02:23:05,150 --> 02:23:09,090

of us or just a few of us?

- Can we build AI without bias?

2453

- AI that fights lies.

2454
02:23:13,410 --> 02:23:16,130
- AI that helps us see
the bias in ourselves?

2455
02:23:16,130 --> 02:23:18,300
- We need tech that helps
people understand each other.

2456
02:23:18,300 --> 02:23:20,570
- And understands my business.

stars behind the scenes

2491
02:25:29,620 --> 02:25:31,060
in Walmart fashion.

2492
02:25:32,416 --> 02:25:33,390

the happiest times of my life

2495
02:25:36,260 --> 02:25:37,910
and through the saddest times of my life,

2496
02:25:37,910 --> 02:25:41,220
but I never dreamed in 1000
years it would save my life.

2497
02:25:41,220 --> 02:25:42,300
Boom.

2498

I fell 22 feet, completely
shattered my pelvis

in the middle of the woods.

I called my wife.

2501

She thought I was joking.

2502
02:25:49,400 --> 02:25:51,550
I said, man, I'm not. (laughing)

The last thing I wanna worry
about, government leaks.

emotional attachments.

2516
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:26,904

love we think we deserve.

Gonna have to move fast
before this gets ugly.

And on February 9th, David
Oyelo hosted the Academy's

2537
02:27:09,920 --> 02:27:11,670
annual Sci Tech Awards.

2538
02:27:11,670 --> 02:27:14,240
Nine scientific and technical achievements

2539
02:27:14,240 --> 02:27:17,560
represented by 27
individual award recipients

2540
02:27:17,560 --> 02:27:21,660
were honored that night.

2541
02:27:21,660 --> 02:27:26,000
And now, please welcome two
time Academy Award winner,

2542
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:27,280
Barbara Streisand.

2543
02:27:28,222 --> 02:27:33,222
(applauding)
(cheerful orchestral music)

2544
02:27:45,791 --> 02:27:47,701
- Thank you so much.

2545
02:27:47,701 --> 02:27:52,701
Thank you.

2546
02:27:52,881 --> 02:27:56,010
Thank you, thank you.

2547
02:27:56,010 --> 02:28:01,010
When I first saw Black
Klansman, I was stunned.

2548
02:28:02,060 --> 02:28:05,700
I was very excited and I was very moved.

2549
02:28:07,040 --> 02:28:09,480
It had everything a
great film should have.

2550
02:28:09,480 --> 02:28:14,480
It was so real, so funny
and yet so horrifying

2551
02:28:17,600 --> 02:28:19,500
because it was based on the truth

2552
02:28:20,580 --> 02:28:23,800
and truth is especially
precious these days.

2553
02:28:25,390 --> 02:28:28,110
I had to--
(applauding)

2554
02:28:31,542 --> 02:28:33,750
Thank you, thank you.

2555
02:28:33,750 --> 02:28:36,090
So I had to tweet about it, you know,

2556
02:28:36,090 --> 02:28:41,090
about how good it was and
then I got a lovely thank you

2557
02:28:41,200 --> 02:28:45,810
from Spike, himself and the
conversation after that,

2558
02:28:45,810 --> 02:28:49,153
was very easy because we
were both raised in Brooklyn.

2559
02:28:49,153 --> 02:28:50,051
- Oh oh!

2560
02:28:50,051 --> 02:28:52,301
(laughing)

2561
02:28:56,170 --> 02:28:58,730
- And Spike, we both love hats.

2562
02:29:00,240 --> 02:29:01,073
So,

2563
02:29:02,520 --> 02:29:07,050
after a lifetime of
bold game changing work,

2564
02:29:08,180 --> 02:29:11,350
here is Spike Lee's masterpiece,

2565
02:29:11,350 --> 02:29:15,690
the story of the first
African American detective

2566
02:29:15,690 --> 02:29:18,760
in the Colorado Springs Police Department

2567
02:29:18,760 --> 02:29:22,030
who joins forces with his Jewish colleague

2568
02:29:22,030 --> 02:29:24,670
to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan.

2569
02:29:24,670 --> 02:29:26,473
Now that is funny already.

2570
02:29:26,473 --> 02:29:28,400
(audience laughing)

2571
02:29:28,400 --> 02:29:33,400
But, it's an unflinching look
at race relations in America.

2572
02:29:34,760 --> 02:29:38,590
Back in the 1970's, that was then,

2573
02:29:38,590 --> 02:29:41,860
but it is just as relevant today.

2574
02:29:42,781 --> 02:29:44,560
(applauding)

2575
02:29:44,560 --> 02:29:47,410
- This is Ron Stalworth,
I'm anxious to meet you.

2576
02:29:47,410 --> 02:29:48,500
- [Man] I'm just happy to be talking with

2577
02:29:48,500 --> 02:29:49,500
a true white American.

2578
02:29:49,500 --> 02:29:50,820
- They want you to join the Klan?

2579
02:29:50,820 --> 02:29:52,400
- They want to meet me first.

2580
02:29:52,400 --> 02:29:54,600
- You probably shouldn't
go to that meeting.

2581
02:29:56,973 --> 02:29:58,280
- You need to wake up.

2582
02:29:58,280 --> 02:29:59,390
Don't think that just because I don't wear

2583
02:29:59,390 --> 02:30:02,542
a black beret that I don't
care about my people.

one of playing a brash
and controversial leader,

2602

trademark cloud of smoke.

I think you might be a song writer.

Don't worry, I won't tell anybody.

and all he wants to do is
plunge a knife into my heart.

You know, my dad didn't get
to see me do any of this.

2658
02:34:28,940 --> 02:34:31,390
But I think he's looking
down on me right now.

So uh, this is, this

You are my equals, you are my betters.

I could have never been here without you.

2677
02:35:40,971 --> 02:35:44,440
I think about what it would have been like

2678
02:35:44,440 --> 02:35:48,860
to tell little bubba Rami that one day

2679
02:35:48,860 --> 02:35:51,670
this might happen to him and I think

2680
02:35:51,670 --> 02:35:54,040
his curly haired little
mind would be blown.

2681
02:35:57,370 --> 02:36:00,080
That kid, he was struggling
with his identity,

2682
02:36:00,080 --> 02:36:02,700
trying to figure himself out and

2683
02:36:02,700 --> 02:36:04,520
I think to anyone struggling with theirs

2684
02:36:04,520 --> 02:36:06,860
and trying to discover their voice,

2685
02:36:06,860 --> 02:36:09,740
listen, we made a film about a gay man,

2686
02:36:09,740 --> 02:36:13,490
an immigrant who lived his life

2687
02:36:13,490 --> 02:36:16,600
just unapologetically himself

2688
02:36:16,600 --> 02:36:19,950
and the fact that I'm celebrating him

2689
02:36:19,950 --> 02:36:23,180
and this story with you tonight is proof

2690
02:36:23,180 --> 02:36:26,940
that we're longing for stories like this.

2691
02:36:26,940 --> 02:36:30,030
I am the son of immigrants from Egypt.

2692

I'm a first generation American and--

2694
02:36:37,040 --> 02:36:41,730
part of my story is
being written right now

2695
02:36:41,730 --> 02:36:44,400
and I could not be more grateful

2696
02:36:44,400 --> 02:36:46,910
to each and every one of you and everyone

2697
02:36:46,910 --> 02:36:50,430
who believed in me for this moment.

2698
02:36:50,430 --> 02:36:55,430
It is something I will treasure
for the rest of my life.

2699
02:36:56,170 --> 02:37:01,170
Lucy Boyenton, you're
the heart of this film.

2700
02:37:01,500 --> 02:37:04,660
You are beyond immensely talented.

2701
02:37:04,660 --> 02:37:06,360
You have captured my heart.

2702
02:37:06,360 --> 02:37:07,923
Thank you so much.

2703
02:37:07,923 --> 02:37:12,923
(applauding)
(cheerful orchestral music)

2704
02:37:15,210 --> 02:37:16,130
- [Announcer] Coming up next,

2705
02:37:16,130 --> 02:37:19,130
a look at best picture nominee, Green Book

2706
02:37:19,130 --> 02:37:21,630
and the award for best actress.

2707
02:37:21,630 --> 02:37:25,280
Will the Oscar go to Yalitza Aparicio,

2708
02:37:25,280 --> 02:37:28,640
Glenn Close, Olivia Colman, Lady Gaga,

2709
02:37:28,640 --> 02:37:29,910
or Melissa McCarthy?

2710
02:37:30,860 --> 02:37:32,610
Keep watching to find out.

2711
02:37:39,380 --> 02:37:42,770
- [Woman] If we show emotion,
we're called dramatic.

2712
02:37:45,730 --> 02:37:48,720
If we want to play
against men, we're nuts.

2713
02:37:50,970 --> 02:37:54,750
And if we dream of equal
opportunity, delusional.

2714
02:37:56,350 --> 02:37:59,920
When we stand for
something, we're unhinged.

2715
02:37:59,920 --> 02:38:02,810
- [Man] Sue Bird's
gonna need to calm down.

2716
02:38:02,810 --> 02:38:04,600
- [Woman] When we're too good,

2717
02:38:04,600 --> 02:38:06,870
there's something wrong with us

2718
02:38:06,870 --> 02:38:10,060
and if we get angry, we're hysterical

2719
02:38:10,060 --> 02:38:12,210
or irrational or just being crazy,

2720
02:38:14,290 --> 02:38:17,780
but a woman running a marathon was crazy.

2721
02:38:17,780 --> 02:38:20,230
- [Man] Officials tried to
pull her off the course.

2722
02:38:21,330 --> 02:38:23,200
- [Woman] A woman boxing was crazy.

2723
02:38:24,300 --> 02:38:27,220
A woman dunking, crazy.

2724
02:38:27,220 --> 02:38:29,910
Coaching an NBA team, crazy.

2725
02:38:31,083 --> 02:38:33,980
A woman competing in a
hijab, changing her story,

2726
02:38:34,930 --> 02:38:36,610
landing a double cork 1080,

2727
02:38:37,670 --> 02:38:40,890
or winning 23 grand slams, having a baby

2728
02:38:40,890 --> 02:38:42,390
and then coming back for more,

2729
02:38:43,264 --> 02:38:46,780
crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy and crazy.

2730
02:38:50,920 --> 02:38:52,610
So if they wanna call you crazy,

2731
02:38:54,290 --> 02:38:57,933
fine, show them what crazy can do.

2732
02:38:57,933 --> 02:39:01,683
(energetic orchestral music)

2733
02:39:06,870 --> 02:39:09,780
- Today faster than ever
the world is changing

2734
02:39:09,780 --> 02:39:11,860
because opportunity is raging,

2735
02:39:11,860 --> 02:39:14,240
this reality changing the world we see,

2736
02:39:14,240 --> 02:39:17,290
intelligence to build it like
we always hoped it would be,

2737
02:39:17,290 --> 02:39:20,140
but it's not really about
what technology can do,

2738
02:39:20,140 --> 02:39:21,960
it's about how it's used by you.

2739
02:39:23,110 --> 02:39:25,760
In the end it's just a tool so bring it.

2740
02:39:25,760 --> 02:39:28,110
What's a hammer without
a person to swing it?

2741
02:39:28,110 --> 02:39:29,610
Your possibility is endless.

2742
02:39:29,610 --> 02:39:33,060
Your limits are few, so
here's the real question,

2743
02:39:33,060 --> 02:39:34,040
what will you do?

2744
02:39:37,740 --> 02:39:39,210
- [Announcer] The Oscars will continue

2745
02:39:39,210 --> 02:39:41,180
in a moment here on ABC.

2746
02:39:43,230 --> 02:39:45,590
- [Man] It's time to go, Toyota,

2747
02:39:45,590 --> 02:39:49,490
go connected with a sporty
Camry, with the latest tech,

2748
02:39:49,490 --> 02:39:52,210
compatible with your
favorite apps and wi-fi.

2749
02:39:52,210 --> 02:39:55,050
Now lease a Camry for $219 a month or buy

2750
02:39:55,050 --> 02:39:57,750
with $1500 cash back or go

2751
02:39:57,750 --> 02:40:01,548
with a stylish Corolla and
lease for just $199 a month

2752
02:40:01,548 --> 02:40:04,850
or buy with $1500 cash back and two years

2753
02:40:04,850 --> 02:40:07,100
of no cost maintenance included.

2754
02:40:07,100 --> 02:40:09,740
Go, see your Toyota dealer today.

2755
02:40:09,740 --> 02:40:11,920
Toyota, let's go places.

2756
02:40:13,300 --> 02:40:14,600
- [Man] What is character?

2757
02:40:15,810 --> 02:40:18,160
Is is a quality that
forms naturally over time?

2758
02:40:20,110 --> 02:40:22,310
Or is it a tree that
grows out of hard work?

2759
02:40:25,088 --> 02:40:26,628
Or hardship?

2760
02:40:26,628 --> 02:40:30,378
(energetic orchestral music)

2761
02:40:31,988 --> 02:40:34,250
The thing about character,
is that while it can be

2762
02:40:34,250 --> 02:40:37,760
hard to define, it's
always easy to recognize.

2763
02:40:39,630 --> 02:40:41,800
Santa Margherita, for who you are.

2764
02:40:43,240 --> 02:40:47,680
- [Man] Do, do your thing.

2765
02:40:47,680 --> 02:40:48,700
Flee that nest.

2766
02:40:50,780 --> 02:40:51,940
Seize that moment.

2767
02:40:53,100 --> 02:40:54,750
Find your inspiration.

2768
02:40:56,140 --> 02:40:57,530
Be extraordinary.

2769
02:40:58,900 --> 02:41:03,500
Spread your wings and
experience the Mazda CX5

2770
02:41:03,500 --> 02:41:05,720
with new signature track and turbo.

2771
02:41:08,730 --> 02:41:11,510
Mazda, feel alive.

2772
02:41:12,849 --> 02:41:15,100
- [Man] It's a deadly blind
spot right under your nose,

2773
02:41:15,100 --> 02:41:16,450
tonight after the Oscars.

2774
02:41:19,010 --> 02:41:20,220
- [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen,

2775
02:41:20,220 --> 02:41:25,220
please welcome Amanda Stenberg
and congressman, John Lewis.

2776
02:41:25,577 --> 02:41:27,209
(cheerful orchestral music)

2777
02:41:27,209 --> 02:41:31,959
(applauding)
(cheering)

2778
02:42:00,880 --> 02:42:04,640
- Our final nominee for
best picture is a film about

2779
02:42:04,640 --> 02:42:07,560
bigotry, friendship and growth,

2780
02:42:07,560 --> 02:42:09,360
based on the story of a white man

2781
02:42:09,360 --> 02:42:11,190
and an African American man

2782
02:42:11,190 --> 02:42:13,290
on a journey through the segregated south.

2783
02:42:15,120 --> 02:42:18,000
- I can bear witness that the portrait

2784
02:42:19,366 --> 02:42:24,366
of that time and place in
our history is very real.

2785
02:42:25,550 --> 02:42:27,360
It is seared in my memory.

2786
02:42:27,360 --> 02:42:31,200
Black men and women,
our brothers and sisters

2787
02:42:31,200 --> 02:42:33,260
treated as second class citizens,

2788
02:42:34,100 --> 02:42:36,250
threatened for raising their family

2789
02:42:36,250 --> 02:42:40,500
or earning a living,
beaten and sometimes killed

2790
02:42:40,500 --> 02:42:43,750
for the crime of trying to
live a life with dignity.

2791
02:42:44,600 --> 02:42:48,800
Our nation battles scars
of that time as do I.

2792
02:42:51,916 --> 02:42:54,333
(applauding)

2793
02:43:00,540 --> 02:43:04,060
- The characters in Green Book
gradually tore down the walls

2794
02:43:04,060 --> 02:43:08,120
between them, transforming
each other in the process.

2795
02:43:08,120 --> 02:43:10,060
As this film demonstrates,

2796
02:43:10,060 --> 02:43:12,610
any journey that opens someone's eyes

2797
02:43:12,610 --> 02:43:15,260
and softens their heart, is
one that is worth taking.

2798
02:43:16,917 --> 02:43:19,334
(applauding)

2799
02:43:21,370 --> 02:43:23,570
- Young or old,

2800
02:43:23,570 --> 02:43:28,570
I encourage you to be an active
participant in a journey.

2801
02:43:28,690 --> 02:43:30,599
This is Green Book.

2802
02:43:30,599 --> 02:43:33,016
(applauding)

2803
02:43:34,490 --> 02:43:36,210
- [Man] Have you ever driven
professionally before?

2804
02:43:36,210 --> 02:43:37,110
- I can drive anything.

2805
02:43:37,110 --> 02:43:39,390
- What other experience do you have?

2806
02:43:39,390 --> 02:43:40,700
- Public relations.

2807
02:43:40,700 --> 02:43:43,390
- I'm about to embark on a
concert tour in the deep south.

2808
02:43:43,390 --> 02:43:46,030
- You and the deep south,
there's gonna be problems.

2809
02:43:46,030 --> 02:43:48,460
Get your hands off him now!

2810
02:43:48,460 --> 02:43:49,400
- What are you doing?

2811
02:43:49,400 --> 02:43:50,233
- A letter.

2812
02:43:50,233 --> 02:43:51,066
- Put this down.

2813
02:43:51,066 --> 02:43:53,540
Dear Dolores, the distance between us

2814
02:43:53,540 --> 02:43:55,020
is breaking my spirit.

2815
02:43:55,020 --> 02:43:57,510
Falling in love with you
was the easiest thing

2816
02:43:57,510 --> 02:43:58,750
I have ever done.

2817
02:43:58,750 --> 02:44:01,770
- Either I eat in this room
or I'm not performing tonight.

2818
02:44:01,770 --> 02:44:04,390
- It takes courage to
change people's hearts.

2819
02:44:06,209 --> 02:44:08,626
(applauding)

2820
02:44:10,660 --> 02:44:13,370
- [Announcer] Please welcome
Academy Award winners,

2821
02:44:13,370 --> 02:44:16,449
Francis McDormant and Sam Rockwell.

2822
02:44:16,449 --> 02:44:20,116
(cheerful orchestral music)

2823
02:44:23,490 --> 02:44:25,640
- It's an honor for us
to be back on stage.

2824
02:44:25,640 --> 02:44:27,940
Francis do you have anything to add?

2825
02:44:27,940 --> 02:44:28,920
- No, nope.

2826
02:44:28,920 --> 02:44:30,480
Nope, thank you very much.

2827
02:44:33,230 --> 02:44:36,010
- Here are the nominees for
performance by an actress

2828
02:44:36,010 --> 02:44:36,950
in a leading role.

2829
02:44:39,220 --> 02:44:41,120
Yalitza Aparicio, Roma.

2830
02:44:41,961 --> 02:44:44,878
(speaking Spanish)

2831
02:44:51,086 --> 02:44:53,669
(dogs barking)

2832
02:44:55,285 --> 02:44:58,202
(speaking Spanish)

2833
02:45:02,541 --> 02:45:05,260
(applauding)

2834
02:45:05,260 --> 02:45:08,010
- [Francis] Glenn Close, The Wife.

2835
02:45:08,010 --> 02:45:10,890
- What we were talking
about the other day.

2836
02:45:10,890 --> 02:45:11,723
- Yes.

2837
02:45:14,150 --> 02:45:17,660
- I want to say that what
you implied isn't true

2838
02:45:19,090 --> 02:45:21,670
and if you malign Joe's talent in any way,

2839
02:45:21,670 --> 02:45:22,820
I'll take you to court.

2840
02:45:27,390 --> 02:45:30,190
Good luck, Nathaniel, I'm
sure you'll write a fine book.

2841
02:45:31,781 --> 02:45:34,198
(applauding)

2842
02:45:35,460 --> 02:45:38,280
- [Francis] Olivia Colman, The Favorite.

2843
02:45:38,280 --> 02:45:39,320
- They are the ones who've give you some

2844
02:45:39,320 --> 02:45:40,970
for quite some time now.

2845
02:45:40,970 --> 02:45:43,710
Seemed like the perfect
opportunity with Mulbor winning.

2846
02:45:43,710 --> 02:45:45,290
- It is a monstrous extravagance.

2847
02:45:45,290 --> 02:45:47,130
Mrs. Morely, we are at war.

2848
02:45:47,130 --> 02:45:48,330
- We won.

2849
02:45:48,330 --> 02:45:50,280
- Oh, it is not over, we must continue.

2850
02:45:51,610 --> 02:45:54,120
- Oh, oh I did not know that.

2851
02:45:55,341 --> 02:45:57,758
(applauding)

2852
02:45:59,679 --> 02:46:01,530
- [Sam] Lady Gaga, A Star Is Born.

2853
02:46:02,738 --> 02:46:04,038
- I want to do this again.

2854
02:46:05,781 --> 02:46:07,081
I won't come and find you.

2855
02:46:10,060 --> 02:46:12,110
Next time you can clean up your own mess.

2856

(applauding)

2857
02:46:16,600 --> 02:46:19,910
- [Sam] Melissa McCarthy,
Can You Ever Forgive Me?

2858
02:46:19,910 --> 02:46:22,870
- It wasn't my work, was it,

2859
02:46:22,870 --> 02:46:26,520
I mean, if I had put in my work,

2860
02:46:28,240 --> 02:46:33,240
and I would have been opening
myself up to criticism

2861
02:46:36,500 --> 02:46:40,650
and I'm too much of a coward to do that.

2862
02:46:42,509 --> 02:46:44,926
(applauding)

2863
02:46:49,621 --> 02:46:51,430
- And the Oscar goes to,

2864
02:46:54,820 --> 02:46:56,079
Olivia Coleman.

2865
02:46:56,079 --> 02:47:00,060
(cheering)
(applauding)

2866
02:47:00,060 --> 02:47:01,901
- [Announcer] This is the first Oscar

2867
02:47:01,901 --> 02:47:05,490
and nomination for Olivia Colman.

2868
02:47:05,490 --> 02:47:09,157
(cheerful orchestral music)

2869
02:47:39,041 --> 02:47:42,041
(audience cheering)

2870
02:47:51,023 --> 02:47:54,740
- (crying) Oh, it's
genuinely quite stressful.

2871
02:47:54,740 --> 02:47:56,990
(laughing)

2872
02:47:59,906 --> 02:48:01,140
This is hilarious.

2873
02:48:03,487 --> 02:48:05,904
(stuttering)

2874
02:48:08,306 --> 02:48:10,873
Okay, um, I have to thank lots of pe--
