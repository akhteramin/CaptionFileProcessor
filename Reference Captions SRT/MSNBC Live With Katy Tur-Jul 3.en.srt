1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,160
- Defined branding for us in the modern.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,600
- None of us knew what that swoosh

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,405
was until they invented it.
- Of marketing, yeah!

4
00:00:06,405 --> 00:00:09,360
And signing Kaepernick you know,

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,750
in those moments where
there was a lot criticism

6
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,930
which they knew they were going to get,

7
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,500
the burning of the shoes
and the rest of it.

8
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,540
In those immediate moments after that,

9
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,666
they did actually see
their stock price go up

10
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:21,499
- [Man] Yeah.

11
00:00:21,499 --> 00:00:22,332
and their shoes sales go up.

12
00:00:22,332 --> 00:00:24,400
- It'll be interesting
to see what happens now

13
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,880
and whether their reaction
to this controversy

14
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,050
was the right step.

15
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,520
- Alright, Stephanie
thanks for covering for us.

16
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,150
Stephanie Gosk, NBC correspondent.

17
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:32,983
Thanks for watching.

18
00:00:32,983 --> 00:00:33,816
Oh, look at that!

19
00:00:33,816 --> 00:00:34,649
We're out of time.

20
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:35,482
Thanks for watching Velshi and Ruhle,

21
00:00:35,482 --> 00:00:36,360

22
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,010
I'll also be back at 11:00 p.m. Eastern.

23
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,220
Check us out on social media,

24
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,790
connect with our show at velshiruhle.

25
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,600
Kasie Hunt picks up
our coverage right now.

26
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,100
Hello, friend!

27
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,620
- Hello to you as well, Ali.

28
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,960
And we will see you of
course in just an hour.

29
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,793
Good afternoon,

30
00:00:49,793 --> 00:00:51,240
I am Kasie Hunt in for Katy Tur.

31
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,080
It's 11:00 a.m. out west and
2:00 p.m. here in Washington,

32
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,710
where the President's own
Department of Homeland Security

33
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,380
has issued a scathing report

34
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,580
on the squalid conditions
found in a number of migrant

35
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,586
detention centers along the border.

36
00:01:05,586 --> 00:01:09,450
The report from the DHS's
Office of the Inspector General

37
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,060
describes dangerous levels of overcrowding

38
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,440
for long periods of time.

39
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,380
In one facility,

40
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,490
some adults were kept in
standing room only conditions

41
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:21,610
for a week.

42
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:22,670
While at another,

43
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:25,960
many migrants spent more
than a month in small cells

44
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,850
packed dangerously over capacity.

45
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,760
Most of the adults have not had a shower,

46
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,140
despite some of them being
held for as long as a month.

47
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,500
Some facilities provided wet
wipes to maintain hygiene.

48
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,430
One man, locked in a crowded cells,

49
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:44,150
held up a crudely-made
sign for inspectors,

50
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,090
begging for help.

51
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:49,470
Meanwhile, many children
were held without care

52
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,690
for basic standards of living,

53
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:54,960
including access to
showers and clean clothes.

54
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,810
At two of the five facilities visited

55
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:57,981
by the Inspector General,

56
00:01:57,981 --> 00:02:00,720
children were not given hot meals

57
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,010
until the inspectors arrived.

58
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:06,600
But according to the
President and his allies,

59
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,120
there's nothing to see here.

60
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,760
Just ask acting DHS head Kevin McAleenan,

61
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,420
who defended the
conditions at one notorious

62
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,973
Texas detention center late last week.

63
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,680
- Unsubstantiated allegations
last week regarding

64
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,030
a single border control facility
in Clint Station in Texas

65
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,293
created a sensation,

66
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,680
that's balanced somewhat
since several media outlets

67
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,960
toured the Clint Station and saw

68
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,320
the actual conditions there.

69
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,530
A clean and well-managed facility
and well-equipped process,

70
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:36,200
but frankly much of the
coverage is simply too late

71
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,450
and is missing the story.

72
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,810
- So, our big question today is:

73
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,840
will the White House accept accountability

74
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,170
for its immigration policies?

75
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,140
Joining me now NBC News
correspondent Jacob Soboroff,

76
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,430
former Republican Congressman

77
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,010
and MSNBC political
analyst Carlos Curbelo,

78
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,340
and former California
Senator Barbara Boxer,

79
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,510
she now hosts the Boxer podcast.

80
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,203
Jacob, let me start with you.

81
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,073
This report from the OIG,

82
00:03:04,928 --> 00:03:06,960
I'm just gonna read a
little bit more from it.

83
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,400
Senior managers at several facilities

84
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,020
raised security concerns for
their agents and the detainees.

85
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:18,020
For example, one called the
situation "a ticking time bomb."

86
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:22,500
It really underscores
the fact that they seem

87
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,670
to have understood just
how bad things had gotten

88
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,970
and just how much of a
problem this was gonna be

89
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:32,430
and yet, nothing seems to be done.

90
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,466
- Yeah, you hit the
nail on the head, Kasie.

91
00:03:34,466 --> 00:03:37,090
And I think the ticking
time bomb very clearly

92
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:41,270
references and is an
accurate description of these

93
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,400
seven facilities in the Rio Gran valley,

94
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,410
but not only there.

95
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,100
It can be applied to the
facilities that Julia Ainsley

96
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,150
and I reported on earlier this
week in the Al Paso sector.

97
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:53,070
And frankly, that phrase,
"a ticking time bomb"

98
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:56,620
can be ascribed to the border
patrol detention system

99
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,100
that has existed in this
country for decades.

100
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,700
It has never been worse
than it is right now during

101
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,950
the Trump Administration,

102
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,930
seeing more families come
here than ever before,

103
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,790
particularly because of the
aggressive metering policies

104
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:12,230
and the remain in Mexico
policies that are forcing people

105
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:15,360
to cross illegally because
they don't want to wait

106
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,320
in one of the most dangerous
countries in the world, Mexico.

107
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,550
But for years we have known
that those detention facilities

108
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,740
are designed for single adult men

109
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,770
and as you have people that
are coming to claim asylum,

110
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,260
unaccompanied minors,

111
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,590
we saw this during the Obama
Administration in 2014,

112
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,160
and now families during
the Trump Administration,

113
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,270
those facilities are not
suitable for the people

114
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,740
that we are seeing cross our border,

115
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,340
largely asylum seekers.

116
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,910
So you could call them a ticking time bomb

117
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,420
over the course of the last year,

118
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,420
but frankly they've
been a ticking time bomb

119
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,423
for decades, Kasie.

120
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,120
- Jacob, the White House
must have had advanced notice

121
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,533
of this report, no?

122
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,060
- You know, I don't know that
the White House specifically,

123
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,570
I have no reporting that the
White House had knowledge

124
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,270
of what was going on in
these facilities and what the

125
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,360
Office of Inspector General

126
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,680
in the Department of Homeland
Security was finding.

127
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,060
But they certainly have
had access to conversations

128
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,560
with members of the Department
of Homeland Security.

129
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,110
They've known about, and
I'm sure the President

130
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,280
is getting reports on who
is crossing the border,

131
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,070
where these folks are being detained,

132
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,780
ultimately where they want to go

133
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,760
and why they come to this country.

134
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,930
So the idea that maybe this is a surprise

135
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:27,590
to the White House doesn't
square with the information

136
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,720
that's available to them from their own

137
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,840
Department of Homeland Security.

138
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,170
I know that they are very,
very plugged in to what's

139
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,550
going on on a daily basis
down there on the border.

140
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,050
- Yeah, Congressman Curbelo,

141
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,670
you had visited and been,

142
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,896
or tried to visit, I should say,

143
00:05:42,896 --> 00:05:46,010
visit a detention facility
and were denied access

144
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:49,220
when you were a member of Congress.

145
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,600
And you are Republican,

146
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,030
albeit one who has advocated
at times for an immigration

147
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:58,270
policy that is different
than what this administration

148
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,403
has obviously pushed.

149
00:06:01,725 --> 00:06:03,900
What is your view on
what the administration

150
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,940
needs to be doing right
now to help the people

151
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,300
who are in these detention centers?

152
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,530
- Well Kasie, first let
me say that this would be

153
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:14,159
a difficult situation
for any administration.

154
00:06:14,159 --> 00:06:17,470
On any given day, three,
four, five thousand

155
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,480
people are coming across the border.

156
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,380
This is a new kind of immigration,

157
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,810
not the kind that we used
to see 10, 15 years ago.

158
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:26,950
A lot of families, a
lot of young children.

159
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:30,360
This is a difficult challenge
and I think we have to be fair

160
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,090
and have to recognize that.

161
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,340
The other thing I'll say is
that there's a major difference

162
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,610
between the detention
facilities near the border

163
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,850
and those in other parts of the country.

164
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:41,230
Down here in South Florida
there are a few of them

165
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,170
dedicated specifically to minors

166
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,910
and the conditions there are a lot better

167
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:49,880
than what we see out of those
images coming from the border.

168
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,640
But the fact remains
that the administration

169
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:57,230
has to do better and that
they would just brush off

170
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,810
this report from the IG

171
00:07:00,661 --> 00:07:04,830
at the Department of Homeland
Security is unacceptable.

172
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,370
Congress has to do more
to dedicate more funding

173
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,160
to update these facilities to make sure

174
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,470
that they're compatible
with the kind of immigration

175
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,720
we're seeing coming into our country.

176
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,610
And of course, the laws
do have to be changed

177
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,610
because unfortunately the
way our laws are designed,

178
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:23,520
they do invite people to
come over with children

179
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,440
specifically because the
Coyotes advertise that

180
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,470
as a more advantageous strategy for trying

181
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:30,510
to come to the United States.

182
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:33,450
So this is a complex, complicated problem

183
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,830
and unfortunately I don't
think this White House

184
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,303
is taking it as seriously as they should.

185
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,820
- Senator Boxer, there is though,

186
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,350
I mean I take the Congressman's point,

187
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,530
but there are still a
lot of decisions that any

188
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:45,680
administration can make about

189
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,190
how they are going to
prioritize the enforcements

190
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,090
of our laws based on the
records of the people

191
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:53,880
that are crossing our borders.

192
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,440
What could the Trump
Administration be doing differently

193
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,963
today to try to make this better?

194
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,020
- Listen, I'm gonna talk
in very stark terms here.

195
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,260
What we see is not a ticking time bomb.

196
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:11,570
The bomb has gone off for
seven children who died,

197
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:14,042
for these little babies
that have blue fingers

198
00:08:14,042 --> 00:08:16,110
because they're freezing,

199
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:20,200
these parents who were told, reportedly,

200
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,240
drink out of the toilet
because there's no fresh water.

201
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,160
This is not "you have to do better" time,

202
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,540
this is "we're not going to have this

203
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,470
done in our name" time.

204
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,920
And we have to fix it.

205
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,610
It's a stain on America,

206
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:37,430
it's being done in our name.

207
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,040
So, what do we do?

208
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,290
The first thing is we bring
back the model project

209
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:45,820
that Barack Obama had in
place that worked very well

210
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:50,250
as an alternative to detention
where 98% of the people

211
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,130
showed up for their court date.

212
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,330
Secondly, we need a surge of case workers.

213
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:57,610
Beto O'rourke has suggested this.

214
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:00,510
Case workers for these various cases

215
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,900
they can be followed so
they follow the rules,

216
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,670
and they are taken care of.

217
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:10,670
And we know that this deterance
is a strategy of Trump

218
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,630
and how does he think
he's gonna deter people?

219
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:16,330
By making them go through agony.

220
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,366
This is not America!

221
00:09:18,366 --> 00:09:20,630
It needs to stop.

222
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,740
Period.

223
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,660
- Jacob Soboroff, jump in.

224
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,700
- Yeah, so respectively
to both the Senator

225
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,620
and the Congressman,

226
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,000
both of you served when these facilities

227
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,340
were already in place.

228
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,950
In 2014, President Obama
had a surge of unaccompanied

229
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,180
migrant children in
facilities just like this

230
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,450
and we saw pictures just like this.

231
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,850
And so these conditions are not new,

232
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,550
so I do agree with you, Senator Boxer,

233
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,370
that President Trump has made
this worse than ever before,

234
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,540
and Congressman Curbelo,

235
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,457
I have been to that homestead
facility in South Florida,

236
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:53,430
I was just there last
week during the debates

237
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:56,358
where 2,300 migrant children
are currently living

238
00:09:56,358 --> 00:09:58,070
in the custody of HHS,

239
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,750
and yes, certainly, the
facilities there are better,

240
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,210
and there are licensed social care workers

241
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,990
to take care of the children.

242
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:07,201
But the idea that we didn't
have any warning of this,

243
00:10:07,201 --> 00:10:10,530
that the ticking time bomb is just limited

244
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:12,440
to this time period now,

245
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,510
I don't think it's fair.

246
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:16,230
I mean I think that the idea
that the immigration detention

247
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,000
system has largely been
based on deterrence

248
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,210
since the Clinton Administration,

249
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,470
there was an official document
that the border patrol

250
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:24,190
put out called, "Prevention
through Deterrence,"

251
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,550
they've known that
deterrence-based model from

252
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,870
the Clinton Administration
into the Bush Administration,

253
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,130
into the Obama Administration,

254
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,880
and now with the Trump
Administration worse than

255
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,330
ever before, was always forcing people

256
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,500
to take more dangerous and
deadly routes into this country.

257
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,920
And that the conditions
that they were housed in

258
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,600
once they were in
detention were never meant

259
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,060
to be for people to stay over 72 hours,

260
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,153
and we have seen stuff like this before,

261
00:10:47,153 --> 00:10:51,022
it's just not as bad as it is today.

262
00:10:51,022 --> 00:10:52,507
- Could I respond to that
- [Kasie] Senator Boxer,

263
00:10:52,507 --> 00:10:53,380
yeah please, I mean,

264
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,271
- since I was mentioned?

265
00:10:54,271 --> 00:10:57,090
- The reality here is that the
Obama Administration's record

266
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,810
on immigration has in
fact been criticized,

267
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,690
partly for the reasons
that Jacob outlines.

268
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:02,523
Your response.

269
00:11:02,523 --> 00:11:04,570
- It's all fine, it's all fine.

270
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:08,180
The bottom line is, we
can look back to that days

271
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,960
where there were these issues,

272
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:14,960
but I would argue there was
nothing, nothing to this extent.

273
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,812
This is now deterrence by agony.

274
00:11:17,812 --> 00:11:19,690
That's what we have.

275
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:21,700
It's just unreal,

276
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,750
and I voted for comprehensive
immigration reform,

277
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,000
had Paul Ryan allowed
that to go to a vote,

278
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
we wouldn't have any of this now.

279
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,160
So we can argue about
what happened in 2014,

280
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,520
I'm up for that.

281
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,670
I'm not absolving anybody.

282
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,980
What I'm saying is,

283
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,570
this is happening now.

284
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,270
Let's fix it now.

285
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,103
- [Kasie] Right.

286
00:11:42,103 --> 00:11:44,980
- Let's search the judges,
let's search the case workers,

287
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:49,030
let's go back to Obama's
plan which was an alternative

288
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:51,093
to detention that Jake didn't mention

289
00:11:51,093 --> 00:11:53,230
that was working really well.

290
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,220
Let's try it, I don't care,

291
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,850
I'm not saying everyone
has been wonderful on this,

292
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,320
I'm not saying I've
been wonderful on this,

293
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,530
it's happening now.

294
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,080
And I'll tell you something.

295
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,027
I wouldn't be surprised if
there's some kind of complaint

296
00:12:06,027 --> 00:12:08,423
to the World Court about this,

297
00:12:08,423 --> 00:12:09,950
that there are crimes
- Kasie.

298
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:13,464
- against humanity going on
in our name, in our name.

299
00:12:13,464 --> 00:12:15,380
- [Kasie] Congressman jump in.

300
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,882
- Let me just say briefly,

301
00:12:17,882 --> 00:12:21,020
the administration deserves
a lot of the criticism

302
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,400
it receives and certainly on immigration.

303
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,810
I was an outspoken critic
when I was at Congress

304
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,030
of this administration,

305
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,410
but I will say,

306
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:29,830
we need a little sobriety here.

307
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,650
We need to take note of the fact

308
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,990
that this is an extraordinary
set of circumstances.

309
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:38,352
I remember in 1994 when
over 30,000 Cubans attempted

310
00:12:38,352 --> 00:12:40,710
to come across the Florida straits,

311
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:43,100
the Clinton Administration
set up tent cities

312
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,246
in Guantanamo Bay, at Gitmo.

313
00:12:45,246 --> 00:12:49,700
We are seeing a flood of
immigrants, of migrants

314
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,620
coming across the border
that is extraordinary

315
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,240
and that doesn't mean it's
acceptable for the conditions

316
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,420
that have been reported
out of these facilities

317
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,253
to be present,

318
00:13:00,253 --> 00:13:01,800
that all has to change.

319
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,660
But again, this is not a
regular time when it comes

320
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,440
to illegal immigration into our country

321
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,280
and we just simply have
to take that into account

322
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,750
in evaluating what's
happening at the border.

323
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,880
- But don't you think, Congressman,

324
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,820
I mean I do take your point
that this is an extraordinary

325
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,530
circumstance but I mean
these people are suffering

326
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,487
as the Senator said,
in our name right now.

327
00:13:22,487 --> 00:13:25,160
- And that's totally
unacceptable and what we need

328
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:29,870
is for Congress to fund new
facilities that are compatible,

329
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:32,090
the type of immigration we're
getting into our country.

330
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:35,440
It's not men crossing the
border looking for work anymore,

331
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,070
it's families, it's children,

332
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,640
and these facilities aren't
designed to hold them.

333
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,860
And we need facilities that
can hold these families

334
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,550
while their cases are adjudicated,

335
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,990
while they're being processed.

336
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:48,850
Clearly, we don't have that in place today

337
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:49,970
and that has to change.

338
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,900
- Sorry, Kasie, can I
just quickly jump in?

339
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,190
- Very quickly, Jacob, last
word we gotta go to break.

340
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:56,340
- Sure, just what the
Congressman is suggesting here,

341
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,830
and correct me if I'm wrong, Congressman,

342
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,520
is what the Trump
Administration is suggesting

343
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,120
and what the Obama
Administration also wanted to do,

344
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,070
which was to turn around
unaccompanied, undocumented

345
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,020
migrant children from Central
America and deport them

346
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,360
immediately when they get here,

347
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,590
and or detain families indefinitely,

348
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,750
indefinite detention of migrant families,

349
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,480
instead of releasing
them into the interior.

350
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,310
I think it's a very controversial policy,

351
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,340
and when you say we
need to change the laws,

352
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,110
I think we need to go a
little deeper on what changing

353
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,460
those laws actually
means and what that means

354
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,332
for the migrants
- Well, Jacob.

355
00:14:23,332 --> 00:14:24,920
that we're saying right
now that we want to help.

356
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,810
- Real quick, it doesn't
have to be that way.

357
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:29,168
We can prioritize cases
where minors are involved

358
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,300
so that they can be processed immediately,

359
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,160
not so that they're held
for months and months

360
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,750
but maybe two, three weeks

361
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,920
until those cases are adjudicated.

362
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,040
- This is obviously
- And can I just say.

363
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,388
an incredibly, I'm sorry Senator

364
00:14:40,388 --> 00:14:41,930
we're gonna have to,
- Can I just jump in here too.

365
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:42,920
This is clearly
- Well, why don't we

366
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,876
- very emotional.
- help those countries?

367
00:14:45,876 --> 00:14:47,029
- This is a very emotional
- No, it is.

368
00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:48,706
debate and that is absolutely a policy

369
00:14:48,706 --> 00:14:49,630
that we also have
discussed on this program

370
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,500
and will in the future.

371
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,893
Jacob Soboroff, Carlos
Curbelo and Barbara Boxer,

372
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:54,810
thank you all very much.

373
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:55,900
- Still to come this hour,

374
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,574
new concerns just hours before

375
00:14:58,574 --> 00:14:59,900
the Fourth of July
celebration in Washington,

376
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,930
including reports that
only Trump supporters

377
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:04,090
will get a front row seat

378
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:06,300
to the President's salute to America.

379
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,130
Plus, Iowa, Iowa, Iowa.

380
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:10,520
Kamala Harris heads to
the first caucus state

381
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,271
using her post-debate surge in polling

382
00:15:12,271 --> 00:15:16,170
to close the gap on
front-runner Joe Biden.

383
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,330
Right after this break,

384
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:20,470
why the President's campaign
is reportedly concerned

385
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:23,150
that it may not have a major tool

386
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:26,188
in its political arsenal come 2020.

387
00:15:26,188 --> 00:15:29,200
(low drum beat)

388
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,060
- As you now have 76,000 points,

389

00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,517

393
00:15:40,517 --> 00:15:42,760
- $95 for the night, please sir.

394
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,401
- Wait, wait what?

395
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,523
- If you use Trivago,

400
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,813
Maybe you should try Trivago next time.

401
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,696
- [Narrator] Hotel? Trivago.

402
00:15:58,696 --> 00:16:01,320
- I found a way to relieve my constipation

403
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,340
that's both gentle and fast.

404
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,960
New Dulcolax liquid works
naturally with the water

405
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,010
in my body to provide gentle relief

406
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,200
in as little as 30 minutes.

407
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,380
New stimulant free Dulcolax liquid.

408
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,110
Puts you comfortably in control.

409
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,180
- [Narrator] Thanks, Golden Corral.

410
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,330
Dan gets his slow-smoked sirloin.

411
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:19,440
And my little trio are as happy as shrimp!

412
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,610
Oops, clams.

413
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:21,730
And mom, got it all.

414
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,520
Hook, line and sirloin.

415
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,450
The slow-smoked sirloin and shrimp trio.

416
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,533
Golden Corral, the only one for everyone.

417
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:31,030
- Hi, I'm Dana Loesch from the Dana show.

418
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,870
If you could be more heart-healthy,

419
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:36,520
just by drinking a glass of
earthy vegetable juice daily,

420
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,560
would you do it?

421
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,630
Probably not.

422
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,370
But what if this
performance enhancing veggie

423
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,700
was transformed into a great tasting

424
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,770
circulation super food drink?

425
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,430
It's called Super Beets.

426
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:49,560

00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,630
your body's nitric oxide levels.

00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:56,710
And that helps increase
your energy and stamina.

430
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,610
It supports healthy blood pressure, too.

431
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,679
I drink Super Beets in
the morning for energy,

432
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:03,110
at the gym for extra long workouts,

You'll love it.

439
00:17:16,683 --> 00:17:19,360
- I immediately felt like
I was 10 years younger.

440
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,570
- Within 30 minutes of taking it,

441
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:22,610
I felt a difference.

442
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:27,350
- [Narrator] Call 1.800.409.0284
or go to superbeets.

443
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:29,390
- If you bought a
timeshare for your family,

444
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:31,910
by now you've learned the ugly truth.

445
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:34,430
Timeshares are the only
thing that you can buy

446
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,560
that you don't know how
much it's going to cost

447
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,280
or when it's gonna end.

448
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,150
It's like giving them a blank check

449
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:42,630
for annual maintenance
and assessment fees.

450
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,150
Sounds crazy, right?

451
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:47,060
The ugly truth is that this never ends.

452
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,210
Even when you die,

453
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,440
your family will be
stuck with this burden.

454
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,540
Hello, I'm Chuck McDowell
and 10 years ago I founded

455
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,700
Wesley Financial Group
with one goal in mind:

456
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,506
helping good folks just like you

457
00:17:58,506 --> 00:18:00,577
cancel their timeshare contract.

458
00:18:00,577 --> 00:18:03,030
And what that means for
you and your family:

459
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,660
No more mortgage payments,

460
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,650
no more maintenance fee surprises,

461
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,710
and no more timeshare.

462
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:09,900
So call today.

463
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,510
The call is free, the
information kit is free,

464
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:15,930
and I guarantee if we can't
cancel your timeshare contract,

465
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,060
you'll pay nothing.

466
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,430
- [Announcer] You can legally
get out of your timeshare.

467
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,770
For your free information
kit explaining how,

468
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:25,133
call 800-395-8811.

469
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,930
- [Chuck] You save.

470
00:18:29,286 --> 00:18:30,119
(Quick beat)

471
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:32,140
- How do you learn how
to run when you've never

472
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,830
done anything remotely like this before?

473
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,620
- We're prepared to do it in a novel way,

474
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,930
in an original way.

475
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:39,230
And we wanna make sure that
we're writing our own playbook.

476
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:41,520
Do you think that we should
keep troops in Afghanistan?

477
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,920
- I do not and I believe
that we need to do it though,

478
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,617
in a responsible way.

479
00:18:45,617 --> 00:18:47,530
(upbeat drums)

480
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,010
- Where do you see your party right now?

481
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:51,980
- It's going to be how do we
think government should work

482
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,841
and who do we think
government should work for?

483
00:18:54,841 --> 00:18:57,424
(upbeat drums)

484
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,350
(techno beat)

485
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,900
- The Trump Administration is
reportedly sweating bullets

486
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,100
over what some are
describing as a meltdown

487
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,410
at the National Rifle Association.

488
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:10,927
Politico reporting today quote:

489
00:19:10,927 --> 00:19:14,280
"The turmoil is fueling
fears that the organization

490
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,630
will be profoundly diminished
heading into the election,

491
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:20,670
leaving the Republic
Party with a gaping hole

492
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:22,317
in its political machinery."

493
00:19:22,317 --> 00:19:24,547
The President called the NRA a quote,

494
00:19:24,547 --> 00:19:26,620
"victim of harassment"
in a tweet this week

495
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,370
saying that the gun
rights group that helped

496
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:31,380
get him to the White
House might move to Texas,

497
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,298
where they are loved.

498
00:19:32,298 --> 00:19:35,270
He suggested the NRA can
get better protection there

499
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:37,410
from the New York state investigation

500
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,890
into the group's tax exempt status.

501
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:42,593
But the attention from the President

502
00:19:42,593 --> 00:19:45,420
comes amid multiple other
reports around the fracture

503
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:48,650
at the NRA including an ugly dispute

504
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,760
over leadership of the organization.

505
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,920
Joining me now, Politico
political reporter Alex Isenstadt

506
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,290
and Daily Beast politics reporter

507
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,440
and MSNBC contributor Betsy Woodruff.

508
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,863
Thank you both for being here.

509
00:19:58,863 --> 00:20:02,210
Alex, this was your story
in Politico about just how

510
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:04,963
concerned the President's
campaign is about,

511
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,940
frankly it seems like a
total collapse at the NRA

512
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,610
or at least an inability to
look outward at this point.

513
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,410
What does it mean potentially
for the President's reelect?

514
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,950
- It's hard to overstate
just how important

515
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,843
the NRA is to the Republican Party

516
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:21,900
turn-out apparatus in elections.

517
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:26,900
The NRA has over 5 million
members and the dues-paying

518
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,670
members they do have,

519
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,905
for them the NRA is a very important,

520
00:20:31,905 --> 00:20:33,820
it's a very important organization

521
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,770
and so they can really turn out voters

522
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:37,770
and they can turn out voters
for the Republican side.

523
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,660
And so without them on the field,

524
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,660
that could have big implications
for the GOP come 2020.

525
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,290
- Betsy, you've done a lot
of reporting on kind of how

526
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:47,020
the bottom has fallen out of the NRA

527
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,370
and kind of how they've
all turned on each other.

528
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:52,722
What is your assessment
rooted in that reporting,

529
00:20:52,722 --> 00:20:55,180
of how effective the NRA
is going to be capable

530
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,380
of being in 2020?

531
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,060
- The biggest question is just money.

532
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,560
Is the NRA going to be able
to replicate the massive

533
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,380
expenditures that it made
on Trump's race in 2016.

534
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,000
Remember, in 2016 it
was fairly controversial

535
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,020
within the NRA as to whether
to spend as much money

536
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,340
as they did on Trump.

537
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,200
There were some voices
according to my sources

538
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,000
who said this Trump guy doesn't look like

539
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,200
he's gonna go very far,

540
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,290
maybe we should focus on Congress,

541
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:20,390
making sure the potential
President Clinton

542
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,800
wouldn't have majorities
in the House and Senate.

543
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,560
But several important
leadership figures in the NRA

544
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,720
including, according to
people I've spoken to,

545
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,700
Chris Cox argued no,

546
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,360
we need to go all in and we
need to spend big on Trump.

547
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,500
Chris Cox, who used to be
the top lobbyist at the NRA

548
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,732
just officially left the association

549
00:21:38,732 --> 00:21:40,500
within the last few days.

550
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,140
How that leadership void
is going to be filled

551
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,220
is really important.

552
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,940
And of course the huge question is just,

553
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,570
are the NRA's financial
problems gonna limit

554
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:51,100
how big of a war chest they
have to spend on Trump?

555
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,831
Oliver North, who was
formerly president of the NRA

556
00:21:53,831 --> 00:21:56,790
deposed and what some described as a coo,

557
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,730
wrote in a document that I obtained

558
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:00,760
that the NRA's outside counsel had billed

559
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,258
at upwards of 24 million
dollars over about a year

560
00:22:04,258 --> 00:22:05,980
just for legal services.

561
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,870
Now that number is disputed by some,

562
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:11,690
but if they're spending on
legal bills at that scale,

563
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:13,450
that's a lot of money for a non-profit

564
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,637
and it's money they can't spend in 2020.

565
00:22:15,637 --> 00:22:16,890
- And Betsy is this,

566
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:19,510
how much of this has trickled
down to the NRA's members

567
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,540
that Alex was talking about?

568
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,600
I mean are people starting
who normally give money,

569
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,230
show up, do what the NRA asks them to do,

570
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,620
are they starting to get nervous?

571
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:29,290
- Look, it's hard to say exactly
how far it's trickled out.

572
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:31,570
And remember among the
NRA's core membership

573
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:34,060
there's a lot of skepticism
of the mainstream media.

574
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,650
They view a lot of the
reporters who cover these issues

575
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:39,370
as fundamentally hostile to the
things that they care about.

576
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:40,820
So as far as an audience,

577
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,100
in terms of the way they
relate to news reports,

578
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:43,933
it's more skeptical.

579
00:22:43,933 --> 00:22:44,980
That said, at the same time,

580
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,860
of course it is affecting the membership,

581
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,440
it's frustrating board members,

582
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,674
Allen West who's sort of a
conservative fan favorite

583
00:22:50,674 --> 00:22:53,280
is a member of the NRA
board and has called

584
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,990
for Wayne LaPierre to be deposed.

585
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,860
And frankly, if you
just look at the debates

586
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,693
that are going on,

587
00:22:57,693 --> 00:22:59,900
on NRA board member's Facebook pages

588
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:04,030
and in the YouTube comments
of gun YouTube pages,

589
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:06,510
you'll see a ton of friction
and a ton of criticism

590
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,250
particularly of NRA's CEO Wayne LaPierre.

591
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,810
- And Alex, you also write
in your story that this goes,

592
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:14,000
the concern about this
goes beyond the President,

593
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,390
that some Republicans
are calling on the NRA

594
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:18,640
to address its 2020 plans and
that within the past week,

595
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,010
senators have privately expressed
concerns about the group

596
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:23,270
to NRSC Chairman Todd Young.

597
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,230
I mean this could really affect

598
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,130
the Senate playing field, too.

599
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:26,220
- Absolutely, Senate,

600
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:29,050
the Republicans are trying to
protect their Senate majority

601
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,990
in 2020 and a lot of these Senators

602
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:33,110
who were elected first in 2014,

603
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:36,260
they won with the help of the
National Rifle Association.

604
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,400
And so you can be that
it's not just going to be

605
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,120
the Trump campaign that's
gonna be counting on the NRA

606
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,600
to turn out voters in critical states

607
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,030
like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin,

608
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,410
those really important Rust Belt.

609
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:49,100
It's also gonna be Senators who are up

610
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,570
for reelection in 2020 and
so you're likely to hear

611
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,970
a lot more from them in
the weeks to come on this.

612
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:55,590

psoriatic arthritis,

634
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,140
little things can be a big deal.

635
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,860
That's why there's Otezla.

636
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:51,690
Otezla is not an injection or a cream.

637
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,803
It's a pill that treats differently.

638
00:24:53,803 --> 00:24:57,830
For psoriasis, 75%
clearer skin is achievable

639
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,906
with reduced redness, thickness,
and scaliness of plaques.

640
00:25:00,906 --> 00:25:02,710
For psoriatic arthritis,

641
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,360
Otezla is proven to reduce

642
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,170
joint swelling, tenderness and pain.

643
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:09,130
And the Otezla prescribing
information has no requirement

644
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:10,660
for routine lab monitoring.

645
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,630
Don't use if you're allergic to Otezla.

646
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:15,530
It may cause severe diarrhea,
nausea, or vomiting.

647
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:18,480
Otezla is associated with an
increased risk of depression.

648
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,490
Tell your doctor if you
have a history of depression

649
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:23,020
or suicidal thoughts or
if these feelings develop.

650
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,330
Some people taking Otezla
reported weight loss.

651
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:26,770
Your doctor should monitor your weight

652
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:27,950
and may stop treatment.

653
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:30,790
Upper respiratory tract
infection and headache may occur.

654
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,350
Tell your doctor about your medicines

655
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:34,370
and if you're pregnant or planning to be.

656
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:36,650
Ready to treat differently with a pill?

657
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:38,713
Otezla: show more of you.

688
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,440
You don't need a new pillow,

689

690
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,420
Hello, I'm Rob Cheng, CEO
and founder of PC Matic.

691
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:06,010
My wife was infected
with an early ransomware,

692
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:07,900
causing many sleepless nights.

693
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,740
So we built a whitelist antivirus

(soft techno beat)

714
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,600
- After a stand-out debate performance,

715
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,642
Senator Kamala Harris will
campaign in Iowa today.

716
00:28:02,642 --> 00:28:05,880
It's a place where support
for the California candidate

717
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,180
appears to be surging,

718
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,309
according to several post-debate polls.

719
00:28:09,309 --> 00:28:12,390
A new USA Today Suffolk University poll

720
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:15,630
puts Harris in second place with 16%

721
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:17,200
in the early caucus state.

722
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,770
The Senator's rise has some wondering

723
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:23,100
whether she can follow in
President Obama's footsteps.

724
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,300
As NBC's Alex Seitz-Wald puts it,

725
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,586
quote, "The question turns to
the notion of electability-

726
00:28:28,586 --> 00:28:31,590
an obsession for many
Democratic primary voters-

727
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:32,448
on its head,

728
00:28:32,448 --> 00:28:36,610
and would have been
inconceivable just a week ago.

729
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:39,760
Like Obama, Harris hails from
her party's establishment,

730
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,880
but is a relatively fresh
face with only two years under

731
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,410
her belt in the Senate.

732
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:46,300
And she has some progressive positions

733
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,360
that could also make her
appealing to younger,

734
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,990
more liberal voters."

735
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,190
Joining me now from Iowa,

736
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,560
NBC News political
reporter Vaughn Hillyard,

737
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,200
reporter for NBCnews.com Alex Seitz-Wald,

738
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,490
and PBS News Hour Washington correspondent

739
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:01,800
and an MSNBC political
contributor, Yamiche Alcindor.

740
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,890
Vaughn, let me start
with you on the ground.

741
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:07,190
Obviously these polls have
been good for Senator Harris,

742
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:11,140
but I'm curious what you're
picking up behind the scenes

743
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,090
with the campaign.

744
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:14,150
I mean clearly many of her staffers

745
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:16,190
have been pretty giddy
about that performance

746
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:18,422
and it is starting to
show up in the numbers,

747
00:29:18,422 --> 00:29:20,170
but at the same time,

748
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:22,670
they've made a risky strategy bet here,

749
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,230
and there are also questions

750
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:26,480
if she is gonna go all in in Iowa,

751
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,270
this poll would suggest perhaps she can.

752
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,623
What are you picking up on?

753
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,490
- Exactly, this is a campaign
that looked at their polling

754
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,740
sitting at about 6, 7, 8%.

755
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,870
Ever since her launch back in January,

756
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:43,240
and the campaign always
looked at this as the debate

757
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,370
being the opportunity
to introduce herself,

758
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:47,460
as Alex pointed out in his piece there,

759
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,640
she's just in her third year

760
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,910
in the United States
Senate out of California.

761
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:52,100
The debate was an opportunity

762
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,130
to speak before 20 million people

763
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,900
and essentially introduce herself.

764
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,410
And what this campaign has felt compelled

765
00:29:58,410 --> 00:29:59,680
to make the case on,

766
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,500
from going from the likes of Michigan,

767
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,170
down into Louisiana,

768
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,890
through this primary process,

769
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:08,400
is that Kamala Harris is a
general election candidate.

770
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,190
Well, Barack Obama won,

771
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,500
we should know, back in 2008,

772
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,150
won the Iowa caucus over the likes

773
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:14,820
of John Edwards and Hillary Clinton.

774
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:17,070
He also won the state of Iowa

775
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:20,010
over not only John McCain in 2008

776
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:21,910
but also Mitt Romney in 2012.

777
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:23,350
That was the state of Iowa.

778
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,470
And they make the case,

779
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:27,950
if Kamala Harris can go into
places like here in Iowa

780
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:30,837
but also up in Michigan
and drive higher turn-out

781
00:30:30,837 --> 00:30:33,140
in places like the Detroit area,

782
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,460
or around the parts of Milwaukee,

783
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,630
essentially when you're
talking about electability,

784
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:40,250
Kamala Harris is your
candidate and that's the case

785
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:41,980
that now she's trying to
make here over the course

786
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:45,083
of these next three days
in Iowans, into Iowans.

787
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:50,500
- Yamiche Alcindor what have
you seen on this question

788
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,173
of Iowa and,

789
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,760
it's true that Barack Obama

790
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,930
was an African American
who appealed to a largely

791
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:01,810
white electorate in Iowa and
it's what set him on the path

792
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,380
to the Presidency,

793
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,410
and the coalition that
we're starting to see behind

794
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:07,026
some of this polling is white liberals

795
00:31:07,026 --> 00:31:09,770
and increasingly African Americans.

796
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:12,033
Is this a trajectory that can hold?

797
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,830
- It's a trajectory that can hold for now

798
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:18,210
if she can weather the
storm of what will now be

799
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,790
an intense look at her background,

800
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:22,590
an intense vetting of her stances

801
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,640
on all sorts of things as a prosecutor.

802
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,480
I think, I've talked to
some Democratic consultants

803
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,700
who say there's gonna be
a number of front runners

804
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,961
going forward so right now Joe
Biden was seen as the person

805
00:31:32,961 --> 00:31:35,710
that was really leading the pack,

806
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:37,720
now after this debate, Kamala Harris,

807
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,300
Elizabeth Warren I should also say,

808
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,610
are on the rise.

809
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:42,380
But I think what we're
really gonna have to look at

810
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:45,409
is whether or not after
people learn more about

811
00:31:45,409 --> 00:31:47,860
Senator Harris' background including

812
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,210
all her criminal justice issues,

813
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:50,850
but also her stances
on all sorts of things

814
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:53,340
including immigration and health care,

815
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,540
where she differs in some
ways from other candidates.

816
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:58,210
Thinking about the fact that
she said that she would not

817
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:01,400
leave private insurance or
eliminate private insurance

818
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,920
for government-run insurance.

819
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,250
So I think once people really
start digging into her,

820
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:06,730
we'll really have to see whether or not

821
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:08,220
she can hold that coalition together.

822
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,900
But of course, people are
very excited about her.

823
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,300
I think her debate performance
really made a lot of people

824
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,240
think she could go after Donald Trump,

825
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,400
be on stage with him,

826
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,360
look him in the eye and
really go toe-to-toe with him.

827
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,110
- So Alex, one critical
piece here obviously

828
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:24,450
is African American voters.

829
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:26,070
And that has been the most important,

830
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:28,990
if I would say piece to
Joe Biden's support so far.

831
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:31,320
And you write, "Support
for Biden among blacks,

832
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,750
a critical Democratic voting bloc,

833
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,900
was cut in half."

834
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,540
You're talking about one of these,

835
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,950
oh, excuse me this is a Reuter's poll,

836
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:38,440
not your story, my apologies.

837
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,050
But they're writing with two out of 10

838
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:42,210
saying they backed Obama's
former vice president,

839
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:45,790
compared with four out of 10
in the June poll for Biden.

840
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:49,200
So I mean Harris does seem to
be making real in-roads here.

841
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,810
What's going to cement this
coalition, if anything?

842
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:53,870
- Right, well this is the
promise of the Kamala Harris

843
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:56,170
candidacy from the very
beginning that a candidate

844
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:58,160
with her background could
unite white liberals,

845
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,380
Whole Foods liberals in one hand,

846
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,580
and of course African Americans.

847
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,329
- [Kasie] Whole Foods liberals, yes.

848
00:33:02,329 --> 00:33:03,162
(laughs)

849
00:33:03,162 --> 00:33:05,010
- Given her background,
those two groups together,

850
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,980
the Whole Foods liberals
and African Americans,

851
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,460
that's a pretty unstoppable coalition

852
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,900
in a Democratic primary.

853
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,010
Of course that didn't
happen until the debate.

854
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:14,020
But there's now been
about four or five polls

855
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,770
that have come after the debate
including the Reuter's poll,

856
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:17,300
there's a Quinnipiac poll yesterday

857
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,500
that showed her climbing
among African Americans

858
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,460
and Biden falling.

859
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,797
And as you said,

860
00:33:22,797 --> 00:33:24,070
that has been his biggest
source of strength,

861
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:27,070
it was Hillary Clinton's biggest
source of strength in 2016.

862
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:29,620
I think the field is probably
too big for any one candidate

863
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,790
to consolidate African Americans.

864
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:34,130
Cory Booker is obviously
still in this race.

865
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:36,993
But if she can solidify
a big chunk of them,

866
00:33:36,993 --> 00:33:39,450
that can create a base
for her in the long run.

867
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,780
And she has a huge amount of room to grow.

868
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,920
She can appeal to African Americans,

869
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,250
she can appeal to white liberals,

870
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:46,620
she's also Indian American
and she's a woman.

871
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,360
Women did very well in 2018.

872
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,630
Democrats are very excited
about the idea of voting

873
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:51,490
for women right now.

874
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:54,420
The question is, is she
too little to everyone

875
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,590
and kinda fall in the middle,

876
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:58,182
which is I think where she has
been heading into the debate,

877
00:33:58,182 --> 00:34:01,410
or can she now use the
strength of the debate stage

878
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:03,830
to press forward and solidify that count.

879
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,190
- Let me flip that last point you made

880
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,640
about women voter's on its head

881
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,700
because I'm curious how much
you're picking up on this.

882
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:12,675
Lisa Lara over at the New
York Times wrote today

883
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:16,630
about the thinking that
a woman is not the right

884
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:19,190
nominee in 2016 because
a woman, or in 2020,

885
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:21,520
because a woman lost to
Donald Trump in 2016.

886
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,970
And there was a South Carolina
voter quoted in her story,

887
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:26,712
who supports Harris,

888
00:34:26,712 --> 00:34:29,530
but this woman who says she
is an African American woman

889
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:30,960
says quote, "I don't think she can win.

890
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,170
And I'm sorry to have to say that.

891
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,980
She is a woman and she is black.

892
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,060
As a black woman myself,

893
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,060
I think that as much as
we would like to believe

894
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,600
there's been this huge
shift in this country,

895
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,140
we have seen the reality
that people will fight

896
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,000
back against change."

897
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,165
How much has this sentiment under

898
00:34:45,165 --> 00:34:47,035
the radar that it often is,

899
00:34:47,035 --> 00:34:50,670
contributed to Harris' struggle to rise?

900
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:52,450
Clearly she's broken out since,

901
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:54,630
but she was kinda floating
back there for a while.

902
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,664
Is this why?

903
00:34:55,664 --> 00:34:56,590
- I think this is a huge problem

904
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,050
for her and Elizabeth Warren.

905
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:00,250
Electability is the number
one thing that Democrats

906
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,610
say they care about this year.

907
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:03,910
The very first voter
that I talked to in Iowa

908
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:04,810
of this entire year,

909
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:06,720
January 6th at an Elizabeth Warren event,

910
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,300
said, "I love Elizabeth
Warren, but I don't think

911
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,410
the country is ready for a woman."

912
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:11,920
It was a middle-aged
woman who told me that.

913
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,940
So this is a very real phenomenon.

914
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,440
The data, on the other hand,

915
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,360
show that this absolutely not true,

916
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,890
that women when they're on the ballot

917
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:21,340
win just as often as men do,

918
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,990
that there is no punishment
for electability,

919
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:25,070
and that the under representation
of women in politics

920
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:27,220
is more about barriers
entry for candidates getting

921
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,450
on the ballots more than
voters discriminating

922
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:31,070
against them when they're voting.

923
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:33,580
So I think the electorate
is starting to realize that,

924
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,305
but it's going to take some
time to combat the perception

925
00:35:35,305 --> 00:35:36,590
that they're not electable.

926
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:38,538
- Of course the question
- [Yamiche] I also think

927
00:35:38,538 --> 00:35:40,122
Barack Obama.
- is what is the

928
00:35:40,122 --> 00:35:41,530
difference between, the
difference of course

929
00:35:43,185 --> 00:35:44,530
between the data that you're talking about

930
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:48,930
and what actually is
playing out on the ground

931
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:50,458
is something that we've
never had it tested

932
00:35:50,458 --> 00:35:51,966
at the Presidential level.

933
00:35:51,966 --> 00:35:52,799
- [Alex] True.

934
00:35:52,799 --> 00:35:53,838
- And I'm sorry Yamiche, go ahead.

935
00:35:53,838 --> 00:35:56,227
- Well I'll also just say
that when Barack Obama

936
00:35:56,227 --> 00:35:58,770
was running there were
so many African Americans

937
00:35:58,770 --> 00:35:59,707
that told me personally,

938
00:35:59,707 --> 00:36:01,910
"I'm not sure that this
country's ready for it,"

939
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,120
but then when he won Iowa,

940
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,170
and he started really
showing off in the debates

941
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:06,980
and people really started
listening to his message

942
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:09,800
and became really
inspired by his campaign,

943
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,077
people put all that aside and said

944
00:36:11,077 --> 00:36:13,300
"We're gonna go behind
this African American man."

945
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,720
So I think same thing with Senator Harris,

946
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,320
I think her debate performance made people

947
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,600
think she might be capable of doing this

948
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,570
and start really helping people understand

949
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:23,930
that there can be an
African American woman.

950
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:26,080
So I think, and when we
saw progress last time

951
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,710
it was an African American
man pushing the boundaries

952
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:29,590
and we can say that again.

953
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:30,860
I think if we see that,

954
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:33,130
it will be Elizabeth
Warren or Tulsi Gabbard,

955
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:36,750
or other women possibly
pushing the cards to say,

956
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:39,060
look we can do this and
we can inspire a nation,

957
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,320
if they are to be successful.

958
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,300
- Alright, Yamiche Alcindor,

959
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,970

960

thank you guys all very much.

961
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:48,530
So with Biden in the lead and
Harris surging in these polls,

962
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:49,760
what about the rest of the field?

963
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,890
We're gonna check in
with NBC's road warriors

971
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,490
Small things, big things.

972
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,890
Too hard to do alone things.

973
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:11,810

to get it all done.

remember the three P's.

1019
00:39:10,012 --> 00:39:11,220

1020
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,820
- The three P's of life
insurance on a fixed budget

are Price, Price, and Price.

1022

A price you can afford,

1023
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,310
a price that can't increase,

1024

(soft techno music)

1052
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:33,500
- Vice President Joe Biden is still atop

1053
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,740
every poll out there,

1054
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:37,370
and yes, caveat, it is early.

1055
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:39,680
But according to three major
polls out since the debates,

1056
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,800
a field of four: Biden,
Harris, Warren and Sanders

1057
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,160
seem to be separating from the pack.

1058
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,500
And when Quinnipiac asked
specifically about which

1059
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,443
candidate had the best policy ideas,

1060
00:40:49,443 --> 00:40:52,180
two of those contenders came
out as clear-cut favorites:

1061
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,420
Senators Elizabeth Warren
and Bernie Sanders.

1062
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,580
Covering their campaigns
and joining me now,

1063
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,630
NBC News political
reporters Shaquille Brewster

1064
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,342
and Ali Vitali and here
with me in Washington,

1065
00:41:00,342 --> 00:41:03,497
Reuter's political
correspondent, Ginger Gibson.

1066
00:41:03,497 --> 00:41:06,220
Shaq, let me start with you
because Sander's support

1067
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:09,660
has been slipping in these
recent national polls

1068
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:13,700
and I've seen some flashes of frustration

1069
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:17,250
from Sanders in that he
feels and will tell anyone,

1070
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:19,950
well, told me in a recent interview,

1071
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:22,350
he's the person, he's the
reason why we're talking about

1072
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:23,510
so many of these policy issues,

1073
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:25,350
Medicare for all, et cetera,

1074
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:27,720
how is the campaign trying

1075
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,063
to get their footing back underneath them?

1076
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,400
- You hit that point, Kasie,

1077
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,750
there are so many more options for voters

1078
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,850
in this election with so
many candidates there.

1079
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:40,010
And that's why you have Senator
Sanders trying to really

1080
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:42,680
focus on contacting as
many voters as they can.

1081
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,910
He's in the middle of this three day swing

1082
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:46,040
through the state of Iowa.

1083
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,600
And what's different about this swing

1084
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,810
is what he's highlighting in this trip.

1085
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:52,320
And I can tell you he's not
highlighting those recent polls

1086
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:55,590
and I spoke to his chief of
staff just about an hour ago

1087
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:58,213
and for every poll I was
able to mention where Sanders

1088
00:41:58,213 --> 00:42:00,960
was apparently losing
support or losing ground

1089
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,270
or ticking down in the polls,

1090
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,370
he was able to throw back
polls that showed him

1091
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:06,250
either gaining support or stagnant.

1092
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:07,910
So that's why Sanders is here,

1093
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:09,520
he's focused on retail politics.

1094
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,250
He's having ice cream socials,

1095
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:12,930
he's gonna be marching in several,

1096
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:16,280
I believe it's five
Independence Day parades

1097
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,610
over the course of this trip.

1098
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:20,420
He's trying to connect with
as many voters as he can

1099
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,300
and then he's also focused
on his ground game.

1100
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:25,110
He just opened up an
office here in Iowa City,

1101
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:27,670
he's gonna be opening up
two more on this trip,

1102
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,580
trying to galvanize his supporters

1103
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:32,490
and bring in as many volunteers as he can.

1104
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:34,760
He wants to show that he
still has that momentum

1105
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,865
that he had in 2016
through his supporters.

1106
00:42:36,865 --> 00:42:39,330
- Well that organization
I will absolutely buy

1107
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:41,910
but I do not recognize the
ice cream social candidate

1108
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:44,720
Bernie Sanders compared to the large rally

1109
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,323
version of him in 2016.

1110
00:42:47,323 --> 00:42:49,025
Ali Vitali.
- And selfies.

1111
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:49,858
(laughs)

1112
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:51,890
- Right? Unbelievable.

1113
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:55,610
Ali, you have been
covering Elizabeth Warren.

1114
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:58,920
She also seems to be having
something of a moment.

1115
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,810
What's the sense in her campaign about

1116
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:03,940
where her support is coming from,

1117
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:05,470
is it coming from Bernie's supporters,

1118
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:07,070
is it coming from elsewhere,

1119
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:08,810
and how do they make
sure that they continue

1120
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:11,460
that slow, steady build that
they've been working on?

1121
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:15,990
- Well you say slow and steady
and that really has been

1122
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:17,070
the mantra over here.

1123
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:18,930
When you talk to folks on the campaign,

1124
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,500
they've really long-held this theory

1125
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,500
that the polls will rise and fall,

1126
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,960
but that to them the ultimate
thing that you can't get back

1127
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,140
in a campaign is time.

1128
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:28,770
That's why Elizabeth Warren
was one of the earliest people

1129
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:30,880
in this race to launch her campaign.

1130
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,630
She's been getting
folks out on the ground.

1131
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:35,040
I know we haven't seen her
quarter two numbers yet,

1132
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,650
but last quarter we saw that
her burn rate was so high

1133
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:40,280
because they're investing
so heavily in ground game.

1134
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,400
And in a place like Nevada
where we were last night

1135
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,470
and where she's gonna be in Reno tonight,

1136
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:46,080
she's really seeing some of that pay off,

1137
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,030
potentially at the
expense of Bernie Sanders

1138
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:49,840
because as Shaq and I have
seeing over the course

1139
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,270
of the past several months,

1140
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:54,181
voters who like her on policy
recognize that there might be

1141
00:43:54,181 --> 00:43:56,820
a policy twin in Bernie Sanders,

1142
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:59,190
but they're not buying him
as the messenger necessarily.

1143
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:02,090
Listen to what one voter
told me last night.

1144
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:05,000
- Bernie is not on my
list this time around,

1145
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,210
I think we all heard his plans last time

1146
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:12,388
and it didn't get him the nomination.

1147
00:44:12,388 --> 00:44:15,151
I think we're ready for someone new.

1148
00:44:15,151 --> 00:44:17,280
And when I watch the debates,

1149
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,920
Bernie to me personally he
came across as kind of angry

1150
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,640
and in your face and that's
not what we need right now.

1151
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,703
I'm done with in your face.

1152
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:31,770
- This is the reality of the new

1153
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:32,890
landscape for Bernie Sanders.

1154
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:33,750
Last time around,

1155
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:35,610
it was him versus Hillary Clinton.

1156
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:36,443
This time around,

1157
00:44:36,443 --> 00:44:38,840
it's him and his ideas
as the central focus,

1158
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,460
but maybe a lot of other
messengers who can pick up

1159
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:42,760
where Bernie Sanders left off, Kasie.

1160
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:43,850
- Yeah, that's a good point.

1161
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:45,700
Interesting, interesting
comments from that voter

1162
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:46,810
that you found there, Ali.

1163
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:49,870
Ginger Gibson, the
Sanders campaign insists

1164
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:51,420
that they're gonna try to,

1165
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:53,317
they're gonna keep their base,

1166
00:44:53,317 --> 00:44:54,180
they're gonna try to reach
out to disillusioned voters,

1167
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:56,570
perhaps even people who voted for Trump

1168
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:59,080
to try to get ahead in this primary,

1169
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,669
but the reality is,

1170
00:45:00,669 --> 00:45:04,700
he seems to be basically, if not falling,

1171
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:07,810
then right where he was and
in a crowded field like this,

1172
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:08,950
that's a tough spot to be.

1173
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:11,090
- I think the biggest
debate inside Washington

1174
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:12,780
when it comes to Bernie Sanders right now

1175
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:14,625
is where is his floor.

1176
00:45:14,625 --> 00:45:17,950
People have suggested that
he might already be there,

1177
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:21,870
that this is his strident
supporters backing him

1178
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:24,320
and he hasn't grown beyond that,

1179
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:27,910
that he's really sort of
capped out at that bottom level

1180
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:32,150
but he hasn't appeared to
evolve or to grow his base

1181
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:33,980
in a way that would bring more people in,

1182
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:36,220
particularly when there are more people

1183
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:39,160
on the stage with him
of which to choose from.

1184
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:42,750
The party has changed a
lot in the last four years.

1185
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:45,450
The voters have changed a
lot in the last four years,

1186
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:48,460
and largely Bernie Sanders
has stayed the same.

1187
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:49,440
And they will tell you,

1188
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,710
oh he's got new proposals,

1189
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:52,370
he's evolved, he's changed so much,

1190
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:55,320
but really, the Bernie Sanders
we saw on that 2016 stage

1191
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,040
is the same Bernie
Sanders we saw last week.

1192
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,315
- [Kasie] Right, and he was
hesitant then to talk about,

1193
00:45:59,315 --> 00:46:02,500
he'll talk about economic
justice but he won't necessarily

1194
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,120
talk about social justice
through a racial lens,

1195
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,090
which of course is what
a lot of these voters

1196
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:07,090
are looking for this time around.

1197
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:09,410
Ginger Gibson, Shaq Brewster, Ali Vitali,

1198
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:11,050
thank you guys very much.

1199
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:15,780
The stage is set and the
tanks have taken to the mall.

1200
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:18,010
But concern over the
President's Fourth of July

1201
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:21,210
salute to America is
only growing across D.C.

1202
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:22,810

- [Shaq] Pain thinks it makes the rules.

1218
00:46:58,811 --> 00:47:00,470
But the rules just changed.

1219
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:02,273
New IcyHot Lidocaine Dry Spray.

1220
00:47:02,273 --> 00:47:03,980
Instant dry technology.

1221

No mess, no residue, fast-acting relief.

Rise from pain.

00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:10,480
New IcyHot Lidocaine Dry Spray.

1224
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,730
- I switched to MiraLAX
for my constipation.

1225
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:14,650
Stimulant laxatives forcefully stimulate

1226
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:15,890
the nerves in your colon.

1227
00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:17,630
MiraLAX works with the water in your body

1228
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:19,380
to unblock your system naturally.

1229
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:20,990
And it doesn't cause bloating, cramping,

1230
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:22,627
gas, or sudden urgency.

1231
00:47:22,627 --> 00:47:25,210
MiraLAX. Look for the pink cap.

1232

- As a real estate agent,

1233
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,800
I've learned it's excess
moisture that causes musty odors.

1234
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,650
Pro tip, use DampRid.

1235

- [Announcer] New DampRid drop-in tabs

1236
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,990
attract and trap excess
moisture out of the air,

1237
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:37,370
eliminating musty odors.

1238
00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:38,610
- Works every time.

1239

1242
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:44,430
- [Announcer] Everybody
has a visor in their car,

1243
00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:46,530
but a visor in the
wrong place can actually

1244
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,410
make it harder to see.

1245
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:50,410
- Nick Bolton here with the
latest from Bell and Howell.

1246
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:53,180
We call it Tac Visor.

1247
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:54,610
- [Announcer] Inspired by the face shields

1248
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:56,720
used by our American fighter pilots.

1249
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,676
- Tac Visor can do things
no ordinary visor can do.

1250
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:03,000
Like block blinding glare
without blocking your view.

1251
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,090
So invisible dangers
suddenly become visible,

1252
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:08,220
and enhanced colors to give you vision

1253
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:10,070
as sharp as an eagle's.

1254
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:12,982
The secret is Bell and Howell's
light-filtering technology.

1255
00:48:12,982 --> 00:48:14,352
Nothing to see, right?

1256
00:48:14,352 --> 00:48:17,340
But look again as we
hold up our Tac Visor.

1257
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:19,910
Our colorful American eagle is revealed.

1258
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:20,900
Amazing.

1259
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,000
- Think it's a trick?

1260
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,130
Bring it in, guys.

1261
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:25,150
Well check out what happens
when I show it to these people.

00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:26,440
Hop in, take a look at that windshield,

1263
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,460
tell me what you see.

1264
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:28,500
- A blank screen.

1265
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:29,680
- Just a blank screen.

1266
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:30,865
- Nothing, blank.

1267
00:48:30,865 --> 00:48:32,985
- Go ahead pull down that Tac
Visor and take a look again.

1268
00:48:32,985 --> 00:48:34,854
- Whoa! What the.

1269
00:48:34,854 --> 00:48:37,135
- That is amazing!

1270
00:48:37,135 --> 00:48:38,028
- That's crazy1!

1271
00:48:38,028 --> 00:48:39,440
- How does it do that?

1272
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,710
- Best of all, Tac Visor is

00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:54,250
then you need a Bell and Howell Tac Visor.

1279

1297
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,990
- People say, if you have
occasional constipation,

1298
00:49:42,990 --> 00:49:45,300
you should know the location
of a decent bathroom.

1299
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,810
My gut says take new
Benefiber Healthy Balance.

1300
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:49,360
This daily supplement helps maintain

1301
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,700
digestive health naturally
while relieving occasional

1302
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,590
constipation and abdominal discomfort.

1303
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:55,293
New Benefiber Healthy Balance.

1304
00:49:56,603 --> 00:49:58,389
(soft techno music)

1305
00:49:58,389 --> 00:50:00,450
- Tomorrow's the big day.

1306
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:03,550
President Trump's controversial
salute to America.

1307
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:05,700
Some Bradley fighting
vehicles which were spotted

1308
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:06,670
heading towards the mall,

1309
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,870
but they are not the
only things on the move.

1310
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:10,050
According to The Washington Post,

1311
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:13,720
the National Park Service is
diverting nearly $2.5 million

1312
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:17,410
in entrance and recreation fees
that were primarily intended

1313
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:19,563
to improve parks across the country.

1314
00:50:19,563 --> 00:50:22,390
Just a fraction of the
extra costs the government

1315
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:24,398
faces as a result of this event.

1316
00:50:24,398 --> 00:50:27,640
President promising a show of a lifetime,

1317
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:30,257
defended his production
on Twitter saying quote,

1318
00:50:30,257 --> 00:50:32,460
"The cost of our great
Salute to America tomorrow

1319
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:34,410
will be very little compared
to what it is worth.

1320
00:50:34,410 --> 00:50:36,060
We own the planes, we have the pilots,

1321
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:37,820
the airport is right next door,

1322
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:38,910
all we need is the fuel.

1323
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:40,270
We own the tanks and all.

1324
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:43,599
Fireworks are donated by
two of the greats. Nice!"

1325
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:46,130
Joining me now from the
national mall in Washington,

1326
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:48,695
NBC's Monica Alba and NBC's
Courtney Kube joins me

1327
00:50:48,695 --> 00:50:50,400
also from the Pentagon.

1328
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,620
Monica, let me start with you.

1329
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:53,860
You are watching all of this unfold.

1330
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:55,900
We've seen some reports of
tourists not able to get

1331
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:58,010
into the Lincoln Memorial,

1332
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:00,520
and I think clearly one
of the big differences

1333
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:05,050
here from years past is that
suddenly there is a VIP section

1334
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:07,959
for the best seats in the house that,

1335
00:51:07,959 --> 00:51:10,180
it used to be whoever,

1336
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:13,820
the egalitarian ruled the day,

1337
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,020
first come first served.

1338
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,200
- That's right, Kasie, exactly.

1339
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,040
And as you can see over my
shoulder those preps continue.

1340
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,090
And we're actually gonna
be able to show you exactly

1341
00:51:24,090 --> 00:51:26,060
where President Trump is gonna be speaking

1342
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:27,370
from tomorrow evening.

1343
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:28,203
And as you can see,

1344
00:51:28,203 --> 00:51:30,190
the customary bullet-proof glass

1345
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:31,600
that surrounds the President

1346
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,640
at such a large-scale public event.

1347
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,410
But to your point about the tickets,

1348
00:51:35,410 --> 00:51:37,250
this is open and free to the public,

1349
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:41,000
but certainly those who
have access to tickets

1350
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,970
from the Republican National Committee,

1351
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:45,410
and even the Trump Campaign
are actually gonna have

1352
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:47,370
some of the best seats in the house.

1353
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:49,400
Those folks are gonna
be kind of in a primary

1354
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,440
section in the front and they'll actually

1355
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,460
have a very good view it seems,

1356
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:56,080
of some of those military
vehicles that you mentioned.

1357
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,830
So, right now we can actually see there

1358
00:51:57,830 --> 00:51:59,930
is a Bradley fighting
vehicle which was parked

1359
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:01,620
over on 23rd and Independence,

1360
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:03,580
and moved here just a short time ago.

1361
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:05,970
Just a small fraction
of the military might

1362
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:08,200
that will be on full display tomorrow.

1363
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,640
And of course that's
what the President wants.

1364
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:12,530
He wants these optics and he
wants to show this to the world

1365
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:15,350
and he was inspired actually
first two summers ago

1366
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:18,180
when he was in Paris with
President Emmanuel Macron

1367
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:19,687
at that military parade and said,

1368
00:52:19,687 --> 00:52:22,280
"Hey I would really like
to do this in Washington."

1369
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,660
So, originally, the idea
was gonna be to do that

1370
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:26,490
over a Veteran's Day holiday,

1371
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:27,960
but of course that got scrapped

1372
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:30,004
because the price tag was so high.

1373
00:52:30,004 --> 00:52:32,070
So that's one of the
big questions here too,

1374
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:33,830
we don't know how much it's gonna cost,

1375
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:35,526
there are a lot of elements here,

1376
00:52:35,526 --> 00:52:37,080
there are gonna be military fly overs,

1377
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,301
there will be all the
military branches represented.

1378
00:52:39,301 --> 00:52:41,400
And then of course the big question,

1379
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,980
will this turn more campaign rally

1380
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:46,080
than a typically non-partisan event?

1381
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,310
That all remains to be seen,

1382
00:52:47,310 --> 00:52:49,090
but we can see as the preps get under way,

1383
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:50,810
and they're doing some sound checks here,

1384
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:53,760
they are getting ready and
yes security has been tight.

1385
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,570
There aren't tourists allowed
inside the Lincoln Memorial

1386
00:52:56,570 --> 00:52:59,470
anymore and they probably won't
be allowed until this event

1387
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:01,150
is all over tomorrow.

1388
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:04,673
This taking center stage here
on the National Mall, Kasie.

1389
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:07,730
- Courtney Kube, to pick up on that point

1390
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:09,780
Monica was making about
the risk of it turning

1391
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:10,930
it into a campaign rally,

1392
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:12,647
I mean first of all,

1393
00:53:12,647 --> 00:53:17,500
how unusual is this for
the United States military

1394
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:20,370
to be involved in a production like this?

1395
00:53:20,370 --> 00:53:22,370
How much historically is this something

1396
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:23,750
that they are used to doing

1397
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:24,950
and second of all,

1398
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:27,910
what is the level of concern
around the possibility

1399
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:30,230
of politics to play into an event that,

1400
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:31,970
I mean obviously we know
our military leaders

1401
00:53:31,970 --> 00:53:34,403
are typically supposed
to steer clear of that.

1402
00:53:35,370 --> 00:53:38,470
- So, of course the military
is not allowed to be involved

1403
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:40,540
officially in any kind of political event.

1404
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:41,980
There are very specific rules

1405
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:44,650
and candidly in the last year or two,

1406
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:47,320
we've seen more and more
guidelines and memos

1407
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:50,240
just in the past several weeks than acting

1408
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,530
Secretary of Defense Patrick
Shanahan put out a memo

1409
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:54,170
with guidelines reminding people

1410
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:56,449
that the military is apolitical.

1411
00:53:56,449 --> 00:53:59,620
Fourth of July is typically
not a military holiday.

1412
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:03,180
It's not like Veteran's Day
where you see military leaders

1413
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:06,370
and bands and whatnot spread
throughout the country

1414
00:54:06,370 --> 00:54:08,520
and involved in these kinds of activities.

1415
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,300
Since this parade,

1416
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:11,650
the first of the planning,

1417
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:13,920
when we first heard
mention of this parade,

1418
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,470
there has been concern
from U.S. military leaders

1419
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:18,100
here in the Pentagon and around,

1420
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:21,100
that this could turn into
some sort of a political rally

1421
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:23,690
that would become awkward
for both the military leaders

1422
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:26,590
who are there and the
military who are involved.

1423
00:54:26,590 --> 00:54:29,158
Defense officials who we
have spoken with this week

1424
00:54:29,158 --> 00:54:30,860
say that they are assured
that President Trump,

1425
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:32,930
his speech will be less than 20 minutes,

1426
00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:36,490
he will speak for about four
minutes about each service.

1427
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:40,091
There's some belief that
he wants the joint chiefs,

1428
00:54:40,091 --> 00:54:43,295
for the most part it will
be the vice chairman,

1429
00:54:43,295 --> 00:54:46,710
I'm sorry, the vice
chiefs who will be there,

1430
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:49,010
that he wants each
individual representative

1431
00:54:49,010 --> 00:54:51,190
at some point to come
up and stand with him,

1432
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:52,760
when they're reviewing their aircraft,

1433
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,840
when he's talking about them or whatever,

1434
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:58,030
but there is some concern that in fact

1435
00:54:58,030 --> 00:55:01,270
that could look like some
sort of a political statement

1436
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:03,029
or a political rally.

1437
00:55:03,029 --> 00:55:05,030
But what's important to note here

1438
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:08,310
is that the Pentagon lawyers
they went through this event

1439
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:10,540
as they do when there's
any military participation

1440
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:11,373
in an event,

1441
00:55:11,373 --> 00:55:13,890
and they found that in fact it is legal

1442
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:16,040
and they are allowed to both participate

1443
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:18,100
and attend this event, Kasie.

1444
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:21,510
- And so has the Pentagon
reviewed the President's remarks,

1445
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:22,900
do they know what he's gonna say,

1446
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,970
to make sure that they are
comfortable having their guys

1447
00:55:24,970 --> 00:55:26,430
stand up next to him?

1448
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:27,263
- At this point,

1449
00:55:27,263 --> 00:55:29,730
not that they are aware of
that they've reviewed him.

1450
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:31,900
All they've been given is this
guidance that he wills speak

1451
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:33,350
about the various services here.

1452
00:55:33,350 --> 00:55:36,096
So, at this point assuming
the weather holds out

1453
00:55:36,096 --> 00:55:37,954
and they have these fly overs,

1454
00:55:37,954 --> 00:55:40,260
each of the military
services will be represented

1455
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:41,470
with this air show.

1456
00:55:41,470 --> 00:55:42,750
You mentioned there's gonna be

1457
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:45,580
the F-22's, F-35's, the Blue Angels,

1458
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:48,200
they will all culminate
with the Navy's Blue Angels,

1459
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,090
who of course,

1460
00:55:49,090 --> 00:55:52,604
they participate in any
number of recruiting events

1461
00:55:52,604 --> 00:55:53,970
all over the country,

1462
00:55:53,970 --> 00:55:55,380
all over the world.

1463
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:57,138
So that won't be uncommon.

1464
00:55:57,138 --> 00:55:59,134
But what we don't quite
know yet is exactly,

1465
00:55:59,134 --> 00:56:01,342
will the President stick
to the script here,

1466
00:56:01,342 --> 00:56:03,853
or will he go off on a
political tangent, Kasie?

1467
00:56:05,010 --> 00:56:08,220
- Always the question,
Monica Abla, Courtney Kube,

1468
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:10,174
thank you guys both, very much.

1469
00:56:10,174 --> 00:56:14,180
Today, the country said
farewell to a hero.

1470
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:15,928
One more thing, up next.

1471
00:56:15,928 --> 00:56:17,940

1478
00:56:35,590 --> 00:56:37,450

what would happen to them?

1485
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,580
Their home, their education, their future?

1486

1508
00:57:48,415 --> 00:57:51,150
(dramatic soft music)

1509
00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:52,580
- One more thing before we go.

1510
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:55,410
Today, in New York, the
city and world said goodbye

1511
00:57:55,410 --> 00:57:58,850
to 9/11 first responder Luis Alvarez.

1512
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:01,459
Chances are, you know the NYPD detective

1513
00:58:01,459 --> 00:58:05,350
from his final days spent on Capitol Hill

1514
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:08,120
fighting for law makers
to continue funding

1515
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:10,860
for the 9/11 compensation fund.

1516
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:13,870
But Alvarez became an American
hero long before then.

1517
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:15,480
Atop the rubble of ground zero,

1518
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:18,780
spending months combing
for survivors and remains.

1519
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:21,610
Many of them his fellow fallen comrades,

1520
00:58:21,610 --> 00:58:23,880
despite having trouble breathing,

1521
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:25,760
Detective Alvarez kept going,

1522
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,030
like many others did,

1523
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:28,970
after the EPA told them the air

1524
00:58:28,970 --> 00:58:31,400
at ground zero was just fine.

1525
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:32,320
But it wasn't.

1526
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:33,240
Three years ago,

1527
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:36,450
Alvarez began his fight
against colon cancer.

1528
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:39,510
Despite growing weak from
round after round of chemo,

1529
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:41,283
he never stopped fighting.

1530
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:46,740
- You made me come down here the day

1531
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:49,523
before my 69th round of chemo.

1532
00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:55,340
And I'm gonna make sure
that you never forget

1533
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:00,190
to take care of the 9/11 responders.

1534
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:05,033
If I can help just one
more first responder,

1535
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:08,440
then it makes it all worthwhile for me.

1536
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:11,453
Really, it sounds like a cliche,

1537
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:14,243
but it's the truth.

1538
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:18,450
- [Kasie] Sadly, Alvarez never made it

1539
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:20,380
to that 69th round of chemo,

1540
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:22,330
instead going into hospice shortly

1541
00:59:22,330 --> 00:59:24,910
after he returned from Capitol Hill.

1542
00:59:24,910 --> 00:59:26,425
He passed away this weekend,

1543
00:59:26,425 --> 00:59:30,050
joining more than 2,000
first responders to pass away

1544
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:33,244
from illnesses related to
their work at ground zero.

1545
00:59:33,244 --> 00:59:34,690
At today's ceremony,

1546
00:59:34,690 --> 00:59:36,580
in the same church he grew up attending

1547
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:39,280
after moving from Cuba
at just one year old,

1548
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,780
his priest relayed the single request

1549
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:44,040
that Luis had for his funeral:

1550
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:46,530
that we all remember
the brave men and women

1551
00:59:46,530 --> 00:59:50,200
who went before him and
those who continue to fight

1552
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:51,790
now that he's gone.

1553
00:59:51,790 --> 00:59:55,100
Today, as the 53 year old was remembered,

1554
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:58,547
the last words he's known to
have said were recited quote,

1555
00:59:58,547 --> 01:00:01,135
"At the end, the only thing that matters

1556
01:00:01,135 --> 01:00:03,107
is how much we loved."

1557
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:06,370
May he rest in peace.

1558
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:07,930
That wraps things up for this hour.

1559
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:09,640
I'm Kasie Hunt in Washington.

1560
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:10,880

1561

Sunday night on Kasie DC.

1562
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:15,723
Ali Velshi picks things up
from New York right now.

1563
01:00:15,723 --> 01:00:16,833
- Kasie thank you,

1564
01:00:16,833 --> 01:00:18,740
have yourself a great
rest of the afternoon

1565
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:20,100
and a happy Fourth of July.
