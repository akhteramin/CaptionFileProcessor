1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,430
- [Lesli] It's nearly at our doorstep.

2
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:03,140
Topper what's the latest?

3
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,640
- We're just hours from snow breaking out

4
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,890
across the metro area, in fact,

5
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:08,260
we're about 12 hours
from snow in the metro.

6
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:09,960
So let's go over the
snow fall totals again,

7
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,940
these are little bit lower
than we showed you yesterday,

8
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,820
doesn't mean the roads will be any better.

9
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,820
Three to five inches
Leesburg, Gaithersburg,

10
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,250
Frederick, Martinsburg,
and points north and west.

11
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,330
And yes, you could exceed
that three to five inch mark.

12
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,410
One to three in the immediate metro area,

13
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:27,050
DC, Rockville, Bethesda, Fairfax, Bowie,

14
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:28,280
and even down into Waldorf.

15
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,780
And in extreme southern Maryland,

16
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,310
we're just talkin' about a trace to one.

17
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:32,510
That hasn't changed that much,

18
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:34,490
you just don't have the cold air in place

19
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:37,350
long enough to sustain that much snow.

20
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,670
Or that much sleet for that matter.

21
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,880
So, what about the models?

22
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,760
Have they come into my way of thinking?

23
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,790
For the most part they have,

24
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:45,690
still four and a half for the RPM.

25
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,410
All the rest of the models
are under three inches,

26
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,410
so I think they've finally got a handle

27
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,340
on just how much sleet is
gonna fall with the snow.

28
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,240
So once again, moderate to
heavy snow, 6:00 am to noon.

29
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,960
Roads will be dangerous, period.

30
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,320
It will accumulate very
quickly and once it starts

31
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,620
it will pick up intensity very quickly.

32
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,260
Snow will turn to a mix, north
and west in the afternoon.

33
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:09,010
It will turn to rain DC south
and east in the afternoon.

34
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:10,490
Some of that rain can be heavy overnight,

35
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:11,830
everybody goes to rain overnight

36
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,860
and then morning showers on Thursday

37
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,410
and then we are in the 50s.

38
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,330
No shortage of moisture.

39
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,330
This is a tremendous storm,

40
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,610
stretching already from Cape
Hatteras back to Kansas city.

41
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:24,850
Even all the way back to Iowa.

42
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:25,720
So, here's the timing.

43
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,960
5:00 am, snow on our doorstep,

44
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,300
but snowed already a
couple hours in Culpeper,

45
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,010
snowing already in Manassas.

46
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,040
By 7:00, snowin' across the metro area,

47
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,610
even in Prince George's
county up into Baltimore.

48
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:38,740
By 10:00 we still have snow

49
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,370
beginning to mix down into the south.

50
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:43,110
I think this mile's little
slow in eroding the cold air.

51
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,500
Still has snow by 1:00,

52
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,440
I think we're gonna go probably
to a mix in DC by noon,

53
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,030
with the snow hanging on north
up toward Frederick and I-70.

54
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,460
Then by 4:00, just rain in the DC area,

55
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,020
but still hanging onto
some ice north and west.

56
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,450
We'll come back, we'll
talk about the potential

57
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,500
for an ice storm north or west of town

58
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,750
when the snow transitions
from snow to freezing rain.

59
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,583
- Thanks Topper.

60
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:07,070
Preparations underway all across the DMV

61
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:07,960
for the winter storm.

62
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,430
Late tonight, salt and plow trucks

63
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,740
will be standing by at the ready.

64
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:15,690
Peggy Fox, she joins us from
VDOT's massive operation.

65
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,630
- [Peggy] Don't let these blooming pansies

66
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,080
or daffodils pushing up fool you.

67
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,070
Late February snow
storms can pack a punch,

68
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,560
with huge snowfalls.

69
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,360
Are you ready for the snow?

70
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,193
- No.

71
00:02:27,193 --> 00:02:28,320
- [Peggy] Ready or not, it's coming.

72
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,570
Hardware stores have stocked
up on shovels and sleds.

73
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:33,200
- Whole new bunch, ready to rock and roll.

74
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,170
- And in Virginia,

75
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,730
VDOT has already started treating roads.

76
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,740
You see those streaks on the road?

77
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,360
They're from brine, put down overnight.

78
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,010
This was one of VDOT's 18 facilities

79
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,750
across northern Virginia.

80
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,720
It looks empty now, but come midnight,

81
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,290
it's gonna be rockin'.

82
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,280
A continuous line of plow trucks

83
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,120
will fill up from the salt dome

84
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,680
to treat major roads.

85
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,540
Sand will then be used in neighborhoods.

86
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,430
VDOT's Ellen Kamilakis says
they'll have 3,000 trucks

87
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,250
covering 14,000 miles of roads.

88
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,590
- Most of our fleet is a contract fleet.

89
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:09,280
So these trucks are
either landscaping trucks,

90
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,370
they're construction trucks by day.

91
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:15,200
When they go from Clark
Kent to being Superman

92
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,070
and they become our plow trucks at night.

93
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,970
- [Peggy] Each truck needs a spreader.

94
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:22,280
- The spreader goes in
and is attached in there

95
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,870
and then they get a load of salt

96
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,880
and they drive off and as they drive

97
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,860
and the unit spins in the back,

98
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,820
it spreads salt evenly on the road.

99
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,090
- Now, of course the trucks
don't plow right away.

100
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,830
They wait for a signal.

101
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:36,490
As soon as snow gets two inches high,

102
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:39,980
VDOT puts out the call, plows down,

103
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,940
and then things get exciting.

104
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:42,940
- What we're asking for this is

105
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,740
for people to stay off
the roads on Wednesday.

106
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,400
With the amount of snow
that we're gonna be getting

107
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,810
and with the rate in which
it's gonna be falling,

108
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,540
we're concerned with that,
especially during rush hour.

109
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,810
- [Peggy] Stay home if you can.

110
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:55,063
In Fairfax County, Peggy Fox, WUSA9.

111
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,900
- [Bruce] And a reminder,

112
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,910
because of the wintery
weather we're expecting,

113
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,330
the Wake Up Washington
team will be on early,

114
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,080
4:00 in the morning we're talking,

115
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,410
with the latest on conditions

116
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,760
and closings because of the storm.

117
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,280
- I'm Bernie Sanders.

118
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,603
I'm running for President.

119
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,840
- [Lesli] Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders

120
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,800
made it official today.

121
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,750
He's joining a crowded field competing for

122
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,800
the democratic nomination for President.

123
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,240
Sanders is the 10th candidate who wants

124
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,190
to challenge President
Trump in the 2020 election.

125
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,810
In an interview with CBS This
Morning's John Dickerson,

126
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,800
the 77 year old progressive says,

127
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,670
he's okay if people call him a radical.

128
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,060
- I believe that people

129
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,220
are inherently entitled to healthcare.

130
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,830
I believe people are entitled to get

131
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,340
the best education they can.

132
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,890
- [Lesli] The Trump administration reacted

133
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,677
to the announcement by Sanders saying,

134
00:04:43,677 --> 00:04:45,287
"The American people will reject

135
00:04:45,287 --> 00:04:48,437
"an agenda of sky high taxes,
government run health care,

136
00:04:48,437 --> 00:04:51,880
"and coddling dictators
like those in Venezuela."

137
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,380
Sanders says he does not want
the US to become Venezuela

138
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,900
and hopes Americans do
not believe too much

139
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,570
of what the President has to say.

140
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:03,250
- Legal challenges are now
mounting to President Trump

141
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,590
and his declaration of
a national emergency

142
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,860
to fully fund that border wall.

143
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,060
Natalie Brand breaks
down the legal arguments

144
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,813
against the President's move.

145
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,660
- [Natalie] President Trump is defending

146
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,660
his national emergency declaration

147
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,630
to build a southern border wall.

148
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:21,090
- I have an absolute right
to call national security,

149
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,760
we need strong borders.

150
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,070
We have to stop drugs
and crime and criminals.

151
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,030
- [Natalie] But Professor
Louis Michael Seidman

152
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,770
of Georgetown University
says the statistics

153
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:33,157
may not be in the President's favor,

154
00:05:33,157 --> 00:05:36,540
as his declaration faces
multiple legal challenges.

155
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,360
- Border crossings are way down

156
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,890
from where they were several years ago.

157
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:44,140
Most of the drugs that the
President worries about

158
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,680
come through ports of entry.

159
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,150
- 16 states, including California,

160
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,870
are suing President Trump.

161
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:53,270
Arguing that he does not have

some members of Congress

Our initiative is called
Impact Health Matters.

327
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,810
- [Lesli] We're partnering
with UM Capitol Region Health

328
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,670
and the Prince George's
County Health Department

329
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,980
to provide all sorts of
screenings and demos,

330
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,110
about 20 of them,

331
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,890
and a few of them are on
your screen right now.

332
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:10,190
Cholesterol, glucose, dental screenings.

333
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:12,720
We'll have doctors on hand
to answer your questions

334
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,440
and you can even give
back to the community

335
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,390
by donating blood.

336
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,780
- [Bruce] While screenings are free,

337
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,610
you do need to register for some of them,

338
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,790
as well as the blood drive, ahead of time.

339

Stronger is rebuilding

361
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,660
a newborn's heart

362
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,680
and restoring a father's faith.

363
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,290
It's standing tall after one surgery,

364
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,800
not six.

365
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,030
Stronger is being a typical kid

366
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,970
despite a rare disorder.

367
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,300
Stronger is finding it earlier

368
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,190
and coming home sooner.

369
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,130
Stronger is seeking answers

370
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,540
and not giving up

371
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,653
until you find them.

372
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:43,450
Because we don't just
want your kids to grow up,

373
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:45,733
we want them to grow up stronger.

374
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,500
- Ready to go when you are.

375
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,200
- Wow, you look nice!

376
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,780
Getting around isn't as
easy as it used to be.

377
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,490
That's why we called Bath Fitter.

378
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:59,110
They removed our old tub

379
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,640
and installed a beautiful
new spacious shower.

380
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,760
Now getting in and out is a breeze.

381
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,440
And we have peace of mind

382
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,420
with seamless walls that
provide a water-tight fit.

383
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,450
Plus their lifetime guarantee.

384
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,520
Thanks to Bath Fitter

385
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,940
Life is so much easier

386
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,060
with a shower we love.

387
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,200
- [Announcer] Call today

388

Hefty, Hefty, Hefty!

391

(crash)

392
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,423
- Hey ladies.

Buy Hefty Ultra Stronger.

394
00:14:25,256 --> 00:14:26,089
A low price.

395
00:14:27,161 --> 00:14:27,994
- Dada.

396
00:14:27,994 --> 00:14:28,827
(soft impact)

397
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:29,840
- I wish.

398
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,820
- [Announcer] Get Hefty Ultra Stronger.

399

00:14:33,325 --> 00:14:35,080
- Mmmm, yummy lip balm!

402
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,380
- Yummy lip balm?

403
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,120
My lips get so dry and cracked

404
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,690
I need serious relief.

405
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,160
That's why I use O'Keeffe's Lip Repair.

406
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,810
It's all day moisture in one use

407
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:45,830
and is guaranteed relief for
extremely dry, cracked lips.

408
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:46,820
Thanks to O'Keeffe's

409
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,040
I got my lips back.

410
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,730

422
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,240
- Get to Nissan now

423
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,843
before these offers are yesterday's news.

424
00:15:18,474 --> 00:15:20,891
(rock music)

425
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:25,940
- A Frederick County mom

426
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,270
and local civil rights leader

427
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,717
at the center of an immigration battle

428
00:15:28,717 --> 00:15:30,970
is reunited with her kids.

429
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,660
Roxana Santos broke down today

430
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,150
as she talked about the terror

431
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:36,740
of being detained by
ICE for nearly a month

432
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,190
despite a federal judge's order

433
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:39,770
blocking her deportation.

434
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,558
Here's Scott Broom.

435
00:15:41,558 --> 00:15:45,641
(speaking in a foreign language)

436
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:50,060
- [Scott] Roxana Santos,
speaking in Spanish,

437
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,190
said she's now living in terror

438
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,550
that she could be taken
from her four kids again

439
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,840
at any moment.

440
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,120
The three youngest,
including six year old twins,

441
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,170
are U.S. citizens.

442
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,987
- [Roxana's Son] I'm
happy to be with my mom.

443
00:16:01,987 --> 00:16:05,657
(speaking in foreign language)

444
00:16:05,657 --> 00:16:06,490
- [Translator] "I'm really scared

445
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:08,920
"that they could separate
me from my children again."

446
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,410
- [Scott] Santos was taken by ICE,

447
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,110
locked up in a rural county jail,

448
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:14,340
and threatened with
deportation in January,

449
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,674
sparking protest.

450
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:17,904
(protestors chant)

451
00:16:17,904 --> 00:16:18,737
- [Scott] She just won a civil rights suit

452
00:16:18,737 --> 00:16:20,910
against the Frederick
County sheriff's department

453
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,440
for illegally profiling her,

454
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,660
leading to an unjustified arrest in 2007.

455
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,330
The final stage of that
case is still in court,

456
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:31,920
the reason a judge blocked
her deportation for now.

457
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,220
Nick Katzs is Santos' lawyer.

458
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,340
- Immigration has no priorities anymore.

459
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,440
They're going after mothers,

460
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,080
they're going after young people.

461
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,640
We need to protect them

462
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,860
and make sure that they're comfortable

463
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,360
interacting with the local police

464
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,700
and that that's not a
pipeline to deportation.

465
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,750
- Santos may have U.S. citizen kids,

466
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:53,040
but the fact is she did
illegally immigrate 14 years ago

467
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,150
to flee violence in El Salvador.

468
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,760
Which means ICE is within its rights

469
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,653
to attempt to separate the family again.

470
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,727
In Hyattsville, Scott Broom, WUSA9.

471
00:17:06,052 --> 00:17:08,084
- All right, so a lot of schools,

472
00:17:08,084 --> 00:17:09,520
are already calling it now.

473
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,353
- And for good reason.

474
00:17:10,353 --> 00:17:12,580
I mean, the roads are going
to be a mess tomorrow.

475
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,710
Between 6:00 am and noon

476
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,600
that's gonna be the big shot of snow,

477
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,780
and the heaviest snow,

478
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,670
and it's gonna accumulate quickly.

479
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,050
We talked about this yesterday.

480
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,130
When it starts to snow

481
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:25,140
it will become moderate
to heavy very soon,

482
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,340
and it will accumulate
very quickly as well.

483
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,970
So here we go.

484
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:29,803
Three to five.

485
00:17:29,803 --> 00:17:31,150
Leesburg, Gaithersburg,

486
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,604
just north of Rockville,

487
00:17:32,604 --> 00:17:35,510
and just kinda touching
parts of Fairfax County

488
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,750
and northern Prince William County.

489
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,880
And notice the plus sign.

490
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,170
Yeah, there are spots that could get

491
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:40,850
more than five inches in that.

492
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,900
In the metro area, one to three inches.

493
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,330
We may end up with two inches of snow

494
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,390
and an inch of sleet inside the belt way.

495
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:50,050
So that includes Bethesda,
Chevy Chase, DC, Bowie,

496
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:52,270
down to Waldorf, and even Fredericksburg.

497
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,710
Down to the south of Fredericksburg,

498
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,510
across into the southern Maryland area,

499
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,230
we have a trace to just an inch.

500
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:59,560
Not a huge problem there.

501
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,900
But if you're traveling,

502
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,310
you're gonna try to come up
through southern Maryland,

503
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:06,060
up five or 301, once you
get into Charles County,

504
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,370
if you're doing it in the morning,

505
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:08,970
it will be bad.

506
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:10,100
Snow fall.

507
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:10,933
Here we go.

508
00:18:10,933 --> 00:18:12,280
2.8, 2.4.

509
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,910
I think the computers have kinda come into

510
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:15,810
our way of thinking,

511
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:16,643
which is good.

512
00:18:16,643 --> 00:18:18,210
Makes me feels a little
bit more confident.

513
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:19,430
All right, so here we go.

514
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,210
Tremendous amount of moisture.

515
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,580
Most of this is rain,

516
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,100
little bit of snow popping up here

517
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,950
in northwestern North
Carolina, in the mountains.

518
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:29,170
And this is on schedule for us to be here

519
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,360
either side of 6:00 tomorrow.

520
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,580
So, on the Bread-O-Meter.

521
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,490
Well, I like doin' a pure
snow on the Bread-O-Meter,

522
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,810
but because it's gonna
be a impactful storm,

523
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:40,800
and disruptive,

524
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,760
we're gonna make it a five.

525
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,330
So we're gonna call it a legitimate storm.

526
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,320
Between the snow and the ice.

527
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,740
And I think it will be
plowable and sledable.

528
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,890
Now, as it goes to ice,

529
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:52,900
power outages, I think
unlikely in the metro,

530
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,240
but out toward I-81,
isolated power outages, okay?

531
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,690
And then further west,

532
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:59,060
Hagerstown into Cumberland,

533
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,570
kinda where you had the
ice about a week ago,

534
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:03,200
we could see power outages there.

535
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,460
We're a little bit more concerned

536
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,830
about power outages there.

537
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,070
And here's why.

538
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:09,368
This model has very little ice

539
00:19:09,368 --> 00:19:10,630
around the metro,

540
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:12,240
and it has okay amounts,

541
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,040
it could probably handle
2/10 of Petersburg

542
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,640
and 2/10 of Romney.

543
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,270
But this model's way aggressive

544
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:20,191
and it has almost an inch
in Cumberland to Oakland.

545
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,943
And even more in our burgs.

546
00:19:21,943 --> 00:19:24,280
0.3 in Leesburg and Gaitersburg.

547
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,120
That would lead to some blims coming down

548
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,120
and some power outages.

549
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,220
So, let's talk about types of precip.

550
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,600
So it's snow if everything is cold,

551
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,630
and we start out that way,

552
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:37,180
but it doesn't stay that way.

553
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,720
It ends up we get this little warm wedge

554
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,010
and that turns things to sleet.

555
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,390
That's what bounces.

556
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,310
And worst of all, if we
it turn to freezing rain

557
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,810
that falls liquid and freezes on contact.

558
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:50,090
That's the worse case scenario.

559
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:53,550
So, roads worse 6:00 am to noon.

560
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,380
It will kick to a mix

561
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,920
and then rain overnight.

562
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,840
And then morning showers,
we're in the 50s by Thursday.

563
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,170
So, 33 snow at 6:00 am,

564
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:05,167
moderate to heavy snow at 9:00,

565
00:20:05,167 --> 00:20:07,680
and then things begin
to change a little bit

566
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,170
into a mix.

567
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:13,130
So, red weather alert tomorrow 32,

568
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:15,040
56 on Thursday.

569
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,870
Look at Friday, what a
way to finish the week!

570
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,021
Sunshine and--

571
00:20:18,021 --> 00:20:19,450
(poppy sound effect drowns out weatherman)

572
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:20,760
Little bit of a blip of Saturday,

573
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,079
chilly with rain.

574
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:23,410
And then 66 on Sunday.

575
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:25,570
Upper 40s Monday and Tuesday.

576
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:26,403
Lesli.

577
00:20:26,403 --> 00:20:28,250
- [Lesli] All right, four
wedding anniversaries,

578
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,740
birthdays and countless
holidays have passed

579
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,950
since Ken Gemmell and his
little girl, Arabelle,

580
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:34,370
lost their family.

581
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:37,340
It was two weeks before Christmas in 2014,

582
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,800
a plane crashed into
their Gaitersburg house.

583
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,600
And inside was Marie.

584
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,460
She was home on maternity leave.

585
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,400
She was found cradling her sons,

586
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,830
seven week old Devon,
and three year old Cole,

587
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,430
in an upstairs bathroom.

588
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,670
But instead of letting
this tragedy destroy them,

589
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,680
Ken and Arabelle are fulfilling a dream

590
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,100
to honor Marie, Devon, and Cole.

591
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,660

00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,243
at MattressFIRM.

650
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:35,440
- My gums are irritated.

651
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,460
I don't have to worry about that, do I?

652
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,600
- Actually, you do.

653
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,220
Harmful bacteria lurk
just below the gumline.

654
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,510
- [Announcer] New Crest Gum Detoxify

655
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:43,560
works below the gumline

656
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,280
to neutralize harmful plaque bacteria

657
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,900
and help reverse early gum damage.

Gum Detoxify from Crest.

(inhales through nose)

662
00:23:52,638 --> 00:23:53,589
- My congestion's gone.

663
00:23:53,589 --> 00:23:55,660
(inhales deeply through nose)

664
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,917
I can breathe again!

665
00:23:56,917 --> 00:23:58,030
(sniffs)

666
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:58,863
Ah!

667
00:23:58,863 --> 00:23:59,849
I can breathe again!

668
00:23:59,849 --> 00:24:00,682
(quick sniff) Oh.

669
00:24:00,682 --> 00:24:01,740

- [Announcer] Vicks Sinex.

671
00:24:03,399 --> 00:24:04,232
Breathe on.

672
00:24:04,232 --> 00:24:05,065
- Whoo!

673
00:24:05,065 --> 00:24:06,080
- I'm looking at that truck!

674
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,120
- Wow!

675
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,953
- That's awesome!

676
00:24:07,953 --> 00:24:08,786
- [Announcer] Everyone is excited

677
00:24:08,786 --> 00:24:11,290
about the all new award
winning Chevy models.

678
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,608
- They're all really cool cars.

679
00:24:12,608 --> 00:24:13,870
- Whoo, I love it!

680
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,720
- I can't stop staring at it.

681
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,400
- [Announcer] See what
the excitement's all about

682
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,590
at your local Chevy dealer

683
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,980
and take advantage of
a great deal like this.

684
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,010
Current qualified, competitive lessees

685
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:26,720
can lease this Malibu
for around $179 a month,

686
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,670
or current GM owners get
$4,250 total cash allowance

687
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:30,680
on most Malibu models

688
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,080
when you purchase and
finance with GM Financial.

689
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,210
- [Announcer] And now, WUSA9 Sports

690
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,392
brought to you by Xfinity.

691
00:24:40,392 --> 00:24:42,910
- WUSA9 Sports Director Darren Haynes,

692
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:45,090
he's at spring training with the Nats,

693
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:47,493
and three things you
just need to know about.

694
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:50,590
- I'm Darren Haynes at
Nationals' spring training

695
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,880
and here are three
things you need to know.

696
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,410
Bryce Harper is not in West Palm Beach.

697
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:58,200
The free agent has yet to
sign with a Major League team.

698
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,130
The Nationals reportedly
already offered him

699
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:02,750
a 300 million dollar deal over ten years,

700
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:03,770
the same as the Phillies,

701
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,780
who offered him a ten year contract

702
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,920
for 310 million.

703
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,330
How much do you want him on this team?

704
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:12,117
- Oh, I want him on this team,

705
00:25:12,117 --> 00:25:14,190
and the guys in the clubhouse
want him on this team.

706
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:16,883
He's one of the best players
in the game right now.

707
00:25:18,361 --> 00:25:21,490
And people in and around this organization

708
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:24,590
have had a front row seat to really see

709
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:27,053
how good of a player he is.

710
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:30,550
But at the end of the day

711
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,630
we can't be sitting around waiting for him

712
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:35,310
to walk through those doors.

713
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:37,230
- Here's the second
thing you need to know.

714
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:40,520
There's another big free
agent out there, people.

715
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,910
Or should I say, use to be free agent?

716
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:44,720
Former Oriole, Manny Machado,

717
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,700
signed a ten year, 300
million dollar contract

718
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,840
with the Padres.

719
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,600
So what does this all mean?

720
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,590
This could accelerate
things for Bryce Harper

721
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,570
to sign with a team.

722
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:55,860
I spoke to Nationals
manager, Davey Martinez,

723
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,610
and he says Bryce Harper needs to focus

724
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:59,270
on what's best for his family.

725
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,530
But at the same time

726
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:02,840
he's gonna focus on the
players that are here

727
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,000
at spring training.

728
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,560
Speaking of Davey Martinez,

729
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,150
here's something you didn't know about him

730
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,230
for number three.

731
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,590
Hidden talent.

732
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:11,570
- I can play the bongos.

733
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,510
- Now, these are not bongos, but...

734
00:26:15,956 --> 00:26:16,789
(taps out a rhythm)

735
00:26:16,789 --> 00:26:18,000
- You tap a little bit?

736
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,618
- [Darren] Can you?

737
00:26:19,618 --> 00:26:20,507
- Can you tap?

738
00:26:20,507 --> 00:26:23,507
(taps out a rhythm)

739
00:26:25,713 --> 00:26:26,950
- Who taught you that?

740
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:27,911
- My dad.

741
00:26:27,911 --> 00:26:29,320
- Great.
- Yeah.

742
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,170
- Good stuff, good stuff.

743
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:32,450
See, we learned something new today.

744
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:34,470
Now coming up at 11:00 tonight,

745
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:36,880
why was today almost like a family reunion

746
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,760
for manager Davey Martinez?

747
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,400
Reporting from West Palm
Beach, I'm Darren Haynes,

748
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,940
WUSA9 Sports.

749
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,800
- [Bruce] Darren's gonna be
with Nats spring training

750
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,270
in Florida all week long.

751
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,930
He's gonna bring you live exclusive access

752
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:50,470
to the players in our WUSA9 Facebook page.

753
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:53,270
- Oh, Darren, he's
missing all this tomorrow.

754
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,110
For shame.

755
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:54,943
- Picked a good week.

756
00:26:54,943 --> 00:26:56,280
And speaking of Facebook Live,

757
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,113
Howard's on there now

758
00:26:57,113 --> 00:26:58,367
if you wanna ask him
questions about the snow

759
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,780
and the sleet and the freezing rain.

760
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:00,613
- Okay.

761
00:27:00,613 --> 00:27:02,160
- So we'll show you the
snow fall map again.

762
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,230
We have tailored it down a bit.

763
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,280
Three to five north and
west with a plus sign.

764
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,430
One to three in the metro.

765
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,900
A trace to an inch down
into the northern neck

766
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,500
and also southern Maryland.

767
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,960
But I do want to emphasize,

768
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,450
if you're driving up
from southern Maryland,

769
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:16,170
from Saint Mary's County
through Charles County

770
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,070
tomorrow around 9:00, 10:00,

771
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,090
it's gonna be bad.

772
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:21,280
It's gonna start to snow quickly,

773
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,113
it will accumulate quickly,

774
00:27:22,113 --> 00:27:25,030
and it will become heavy
also rather quickly.

775
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:27,340
But, once we get through that we're okay.

776
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:30,070
We're 56 on Thursday, 50s on Friday,

777
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:33,130
and let's just jump ahead to 66 on Sunday.

778
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:35,250

off the road for one day,

779
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,143
I would do it.

00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,010
- I never thought I'd say this

813
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:16,980
but I found bladder leak underwear

814
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,490
that's actually pretty.

815
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:19,980
Always discreet Boutique.

816
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,280
Hidden inside is a super absorbent core

817
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,980
that quickly turns liquid to gel.

818
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,510
So I feel protected.

819
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,442
And pretty.

820
00:29:26,442 --> 00:29:28,630
Always discreet Boutique.

821
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:30,500
- Do I use a toothpaste
that whitens my teeth,

822
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,510
or one that's good for my teeth?

823
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:33,880
Now I don't have to choose.

824
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,730
Crest 3D White.

825
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:36,000
The whitening therapy collection.

826
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,500
Now with charcoal or coconut oil.

827
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,570
It gently whitens,

828
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:41,290
plus it has a fortifying
formula to protect your enamel.

829
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:42,123
Crest.

830
00:29:42,123 --> 00:29:43,910
Healthy, beautiful smiles for life.

831
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:45,917
- [Announcer] Stronger
is blasting her tumors

832
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:48,410
without risking her bones.

833
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:49,940
It's training her good cells

834
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,123
to fight the bad guys.

835
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,240
Stronger is less pain,

836
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,670
new hope,

837
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,460
more fight.

838
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,580
It's doing everything in your power

839
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,640
and everything it ours.

840
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,770
Stronger is changing
even faster than they do.

841
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:07,330
Because we don't just
want your kids to grow up,

842
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:09,783
we want them to grow up stronger.

843
00:30:10,846 --> 00:30:13,513
(upbeat music)
