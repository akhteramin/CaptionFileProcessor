1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,980
- Thing that matters is how much we loved.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,980
May he rest in peace.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,540
That wraps things up for us this hour,

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,250
I'm Kasie Hunt in Washington.

5
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,510
Please do follow me on Twitter

6
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,750
and catch me every
Sunday night on Kasie DC.

7
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,990
Ali Velshi picks things up
from New York right now,

8
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:16,073
Hi Ali.
- Kacie, thank you,

9
00:00:16,073 --> 00:00:18,360
have yourself a great
rest of the afternoon

10
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,160
and a happy fourth of July.

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,640
President Trump has launched a new attack

12
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,670
on China and Europe,

13
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,180
accusing them of playing a big
currency manipulation game.

14
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,840
He tweeted this morning
that the United States

15
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,840
should match the effort or
continue being the dummies

16
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,800
who sit back and politely watch

17
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,470
as other countries continue
to play their games,

18
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:36,910
as they have for many years.

19
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,850
Such a move, by the way,
would directly contradict

20
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,280
U.S. policy not to
manipulate the dollar's value

21
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,960
to gain trade advantages.

22
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,320
And the Treasury Department
said earlier this year

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,614
that no country meets it's criteria

24
00:00:48,614 --> 00:00:50,870
of being labeled a currency manipulator,

25
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,274
although it put China
and eight other countries

26
00:00:53,274 --> 00:00:54,560
on a watch list.

27
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,810
Donald Trump has been
pushing this issue for years.

28
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,820
As a candidate in 2016 he
repeatedly accused China

29
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,693
of manipulating its currency
and vowed to fight back.

30
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,280
- We can't let these other countries

31
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,850
manipulate their currencies,

32
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,270
they're devaluing their currencies,

33
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,870
they're making it impossible
for our country's,

34
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,530
our companies cannot compete.

35
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,520
So we're gonna have our jobs

36
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,310
and we're gonna make our own product

37
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,410
and we're gonna sell that product also,

38
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:24,930
and we're not not gonna let China

39
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,810
and all these countries continue
to devalue their currency.

40
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:31,840
- Now the markets
definitely seem to shrug off

41
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,750
the President's tweet.

42
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,470
In the very short pre-holiday
trading day that we had today,

43
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,880
markets are already closed,

44
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,980
The Dowgate 179 points to close

45
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:42,117
at a record high of 26,966,

46
00:01:42,117 --> 00:01:44,450
the S and P 500 closed at a record as well

47
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:45,520
for the third day in a row,

48
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,710
the Nasdaq also closing
at a new all time record,

49
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,990
but let's talk about this.

50
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,700
What is currency manipulation?

51
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,670
Well it's a policy in which a
government or a central bank

52
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:57,660
sells its own currency
into the world market

53
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,580
and buys a foreign currency,
such as U.S. dollars,

54
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,270
thereby reducing demand
for its own currency.

55
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,100
When you reduce demand for something,

56
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,540
you drive the value of it down.

57
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:10,020
Now when a currency drives
down the value of its currency

58
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,980
makes its exports cheaper

59
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,400
and it makes importing more expensive

60
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,390
and when a country boosts its exports,

61
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,260
that helps lower its trade deficit,

62
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,600
something President Trump
has said he wants to do.

63
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,180
But manipulating the U.S. dollar
could have a mixed effect.

64
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,060
Lowering the value of the U.S. dollar

65
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,440
would likely boost exports

66
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,490
and while that's good news,

67
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:32,110
manipulating the dollar could
also cause foreign investors

68
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,220
to move their investments elsewhere

69
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,140
because a lower dollar means lower returns

70
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,160
on your investments, in addition,

71
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,150
it would effect the price of
oil, gold and other commodities

72
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,730
which are priced in U.S. dollars.

73
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:44,710
So bottom line is,

74
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,730
it's a complicated and difficult business

75
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,760
to manipulate the value of your
currency on global markets.

76
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,840
I wanna have a closer look
at this with Jared Bernstein,

77
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,570
he was a chief economist
and economic policy advisor

78
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,160
to former Vice President Joe Biden,

79
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,684
he's now a senior fellow at the center

80
00:02:57,684 --> 00:02:59,930
on budget and policy priorities,

81
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:00,960
Jared good to see you

82
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,152
and I guess I wanna start by saying

83
00:03:02,152 --> 00:03:04,250
you're a progressive economist,

84
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,270
but this is not really a partisan
issue, generally speaking.

85
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,500
There are schools of thought
about lowering currencies

86
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,333
and raising them,

87
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:13,070
but it doesn't tend to be a
Republican/Democrat issue.

88
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:16,760
- No, and in fact, Presidents
of all political stripes

89
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,760
have long said, we
support a strong dollar,

90
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,360
and in that sense, Trump is unusual.

91
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,593
Let me tell you something
else that's unusual.

92
00:03:24,593 --> 00:03:28,970
At least half of that Trump
tweet was kind of accurate.

93
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:32,560
It is true that many of
our trading partners,

94
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,110
China not right now by the
way, but certainly in the past,

95
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:39,110
have managed or misaligned
their currency values

96
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,200
precisely in the way you just described,

97
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,380
to make their exports to us cheaper,

98
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,430
and ours to them more expensive,

99
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,950
and the result is a
significant trade imbalance,

100
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:52,540
which you've had in this
country for many decades.

101
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,240
The ironic thing is that Trump's actions

102
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,990
have actually made this problem worse.

103
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,590
They've strengthened the dollar.

104
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,651
- First of all, is this an achievable?

105
00:04:01,651 --> 00:04:04,660
When Donald Trump says
we should play that game,

106
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,070
can you play that game
with the U.S. dollar,

107
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:10,670
given that the entire world
collects U.S. dollars,

108
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,580
not just to buy goods, but to buy oil,

109
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,350
to buy gold, to buy, most
commodities in the world

110
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,530
are priced in U.S. dollars.

111
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:19,950
So can the U.S., unlike
Zimbabwe or Thailand,

112
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,060
or a place like that, can
it actually manipulate

113
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,070
its currency deliberately?

114
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,400
- The answer is yes, it could,

115
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,560
but you raise a really
important fundamental point.

116
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,120
The U.S. dollar is the
primary reserve currency

117
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,953
of the world.

118
00:04:33,953 --> 00:04:35,570
That's the currency
that, as you just said,

119
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,840
other countries often trade in.

120
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,360
Also, what's the safest asset

121
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,940
if you want to park your
money somewhere safe?

122
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,230
It's here in the U.S.,

123
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:47,660
and so that means folks
need dollars to buy

124
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,440
our treasury securities.

125
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,380
By the way, when I said
Trump is partly at the core

126
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,900
of this problem, by running
these very very large budget

127
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,300
deficits, especially at a
period of lull unemployment,

128
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,500
not only is our country growing faster,

129
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,650
and that tends to make our dollar stronger

130
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,886
than other currencies,
but it's pulling in more

131
00:05:05,886 --> 00:05:10,510
capital from across the globe,
seeking these safe assets.

132
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:14,020
But, bottom line, yes there
are things we could do,

133
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,130
and frankly, things we should do.

134
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:19,130
The least we should do is identify those

135
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:21,520
who manipulate their
currencies, and amazingly,

136
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,520
the Trump administration has essentially

137
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,353
refused to do.

138
00:05:24,353 --> 00:05:26,899
- Let's talk about being
the primary reserve

139
00:05:26,899 --> 00:05:28,200
currency of the world.

140
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,590
One of the reasons the U.S. is that thing

141
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:33,020
is because it's relatively stable.

142
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:36,730
If you put your money in to
U.S. dollars to buy treasuries,

143
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,870
or to buy property in Miami
or whatever it is you do

144
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,640
with your money, the value of the currency

145
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,790
doesn't tend to fluctuate all that much.

146
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:46,110
If we send out a signal
that we're looking to reduce

147
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,979
the value of the U.S.
dollar, what's the effect

148
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:51,660
on all those people,
companies, sovereign well funds

149
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,500
that invest in dollars because
it's a safe, steady currency?

150
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,510
- You know, it's really
hard to say because we just

151
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,380
don't do that.

152
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,540
I will say, though, that
the dollar fluctuates

153
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,480
pretty significantly.

154
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,160
In fact, one of the ways
you can tell when China

155
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,240
and other were pegging their currency,

156
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,330
is that they didn't fluctuate
relative to the dollar.

157
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:12,760
They kept it at a very stable
level, a straight line.

158
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,180
But, the U.S. dollar goes up and down,

159
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:20,040
it's up maybe seven to 10%
over the last few months,

160
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,292
and we don't see dramatic
changes in any of the

161
00:06:23,292 --> 00:06:26,130
kind of trades you just mentioned.

162
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:29,780
So I actually think that
it would be worth our while

163
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:33,330
to at least examine ways
in which we can push back

164
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,440
against those who
misalign their currencies,

165
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,690
because it does lead to
significant trade imbalances.

166
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:43,100
I just wanna make it clear
that most of what Donald Trump

167
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,220
does has made the problem worse.

168
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,350
- Jared, good to see you as always.

169
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,810
Thanks for tackling a complicated
topic for our viewers.

170
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:49,800
Jared Bernstein,
- Thank you.

171
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,470
- is a senior fellow

172
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,860
at the Center on Budget
and Policy Priorities.

173
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,460
While the President
creates this latest issue

174
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,410
over currency manipulation,
the administration

175
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,001
is getting legal pushback
for how it's handling

176
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:01,151
the immense backlog of immigration cases

177
00:07:01,151 --> 00:07:03,260
in the U.S. court system.

178
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,570
A federal judge reversed a directive from

179
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,710
Attorney General William Barr that ordered

180
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,360
immigration judges to hold

181
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,390
asylum seeking migrants without bail.

182
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,290
It kept migrants detained
while their cases

183
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:15,816
are processed instead releasing them

184
00:07:15,816 --> 00:07:18,230
while their cases move through the courts.

185
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,100
Critics said this
administration's directive

186
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,590
would have kept up to
40,000 migrants in custody

187
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,520
for six months or more
without the government

188
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,190
having to justify the detentions.

189
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:30,067
Now as of April, there's
a backlog of nearly

190
00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:35,067
900,000 cases pending,
cases overseen by 424 judges

191
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,810
across the country.

192
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:41,250
The U.S. District Judge
ruled that the policy

193
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,710
was unconstitutional and
maintained that those

194
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,880
entering the United States
are entitled due process

195
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,360
under the Fifth Amendment.

196
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,300
The court concluded
among those protections

197
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,300
is a longstanding prohibition
against indefinite

198
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,980
civil detention with no
opportunity to test its necessity.

199
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,207
The Ninth Circuit has expressed,

200
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,690
"grave doubts that any
statute that allows for

201
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,810
arbitrary prolonged detention

202
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,680
without any process is constitutional."

203
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,040
Let's remind ourselves what the problem is

204
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,230
that the government is solving here.

205
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,870
Before this change was made,

206
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:14,647
the Department of Homeland
Security says only 7.89%

207
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,830
of asylum seekers from the
northern triangle countries,

208
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:23,130
Guatemala, Honduras and El
Salvador, were granted asylum

209
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:24,950
in the fiscal year of 2017.

210
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,110
So when people tell you that
there's this crazy system

211
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,813
where people are applying
for asylum and getting it,

212
00:08:29,813 --> 00:08:32,470
7.89% of people from
those countries get it.

213
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,810
Figures from the Justice
Department show 89%

214
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:38,430
of asylum seekers do in fact
show up for their court dates,

215
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:40,640
so we're talking about 11%

216
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,040
whose cases are decided in absentia.

217
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,250
Typically, those cases are
decided against those people,

218
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,450
so it's just important to keep
track of what this serious

219
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,810
problem, or so called serious problem,

220
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:51,730
is that we're solving.

221
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,450
I wanna get into the
significance of all this

222
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,580
with MSNBC's legal analyst Danny Cevallos.

223
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,710
Danny, this is another
reminder that the constitution

224
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:00,270
of the United States, in most
cases, makes no distinction

225
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:04,780
between citizens and noncitizens
in its prescriptions,

226
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,583
so, in this case, the
Fifth Amendment clause

227
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:11,890
that calls for a speedy
trial is for everybody.

228
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:14,300
- Yes, but the government
actually argued against

229
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,720
what you just said, by
arguing to the court

230
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,490
that these migrants
are excludable persons.

231
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,450
They don't really fit
within the group of people

232
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,750
protected by the constitution.

233
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:29,280
And the court said that is not
the case in this situation.

234
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,310
As a criminal defense attorney,
I have to tell you that when

235
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:35,490
your client is held in custody,
there's such a difference

236
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:37,550
between a client that is held in custody

237
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,870
and not in custody that's
out that you can contact,

238
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,142
you can call, you can meet with them.

239
00:09:42,142 --> 00:09:45,300
Any lawyer always provides
better legal services,

240
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,540
and that client is better
served, when they can fight

241
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,940
their case on the outside,
and not the inside.

242
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,420
What's different here is
that these are non criminals.

243
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,400
These are non criminals being detained,

244
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,410
and I should add, a decision

245
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:57,670
that has had such a ripple effect

246
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,790
that you just talked about.

247
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,980
Statistically, this is
causing an immense backlog

248
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,126
in the courts, and that's
another thing I can tell,

249
00:10:04,126 --> 00:10:08,010
from experience, is a very
dangerous thing for those

250
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,121
with constitutional
rights, which is everyone,

251
00:10:10,121 --> 00:10:12,623
which is a backlog in the criminal courts.

252
00:10:12,623 --> 00:10:14,640
- That would be a problem in any country,

253
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,730
but it's actually something
in the United States that

254
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,810
is in our constitution.
- Massively so.

255
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,800
- It's obviously open to
interpretation what a speedy

256
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,220
trial is, but when you have
400 some odd immigration

257
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,304
judges dealing with 900,000
cases, that is going to be,

258
00:10:28,304 --> 00:10:30,550
at our current pace, that's decades.

259
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,360
- I saw it with my own
eyes, covering this issue

260
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,280
at the border.

261
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,440
Slightly different but
the Trump administration

262
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,110
made a summary decision
to start prosecuting

263
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,890
more and more of these entry cases,

264
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:42,740
and the backlog that created
was almost overwhelming.

265
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,200
The courts are very sensitive to backlog,

266
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,230
and even the federal courts,
which may have more resources,

267
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,160
can be crippled.

268
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,720
So too can this entire
immigration process by a decision

269
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,710
that causes a backlog by holding people

270
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:56,610
longer than necessary.

271
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,690
Keep in mind, the government argued that,

272
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,560
look there are other cases
that say you can hold

273
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,930
people up to six months.

274
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,280
What's with this seven days?

275
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,280
That's such a fast timeline.

276
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,970
But the court here said,
no, that's not the issue.

277
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:10,100
The fundamental issue
here is whether or not

278
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,610
these people can be held
without any bail hearing

279
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:13,900
at all whatsoever.

280
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,610
- All right, thank you Danny
for clearing this up for us.

281
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,840
Danny Cevallos is our legal analyst.

282
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,020
To really underscore this
administration's policy

283
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,460
on immigration, I turned to this quote,

284
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,010
a "ticking time bomb."

285
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:25,344
That's how senior managers
at several border patrol

286
00:11:25,344 --> 00:11:29,240
facilities at the Rio Grande
Valley describe the situation.

287
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,530
The Homeland Security Department's

288
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:32,220
Office of Inspector General

289
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,270
detailed the dire situation
inside these detention

290
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,920
facilities, giving the
public its first actual look

291
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,570
at the situation inside, and
despite the outright denials

292
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:44,470
from the administration,
the situation is dire.

293
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,270
In June, the Office, be
reminded this is the Inspector

294
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,810
General for the Department
of Homeland Security,

295
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,450
this isn't reporters, this isn't

296
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:52,940
Democratic members of Congress.

297
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,960
The Office visited five border patrol

298
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,487
facilities, and two ports
of entry, observing,

299
00:11:57,487 --> 00:12:00,180
"serious overcrowding
and prolonged detention."

300
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,970
They found the border
patrol was holding about

301
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:05,330
8,000 detainees in custody
at the time of their visit,

302
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:10,080
with 3,400 held longer than the
72 hours generally permitted

303
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,470
under the Customs and
Border Protection standards.

304
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:15,810
1,500 of those detained were
held for more than 10 days.

305
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:18,670
826 children were held at those facilities

306
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,230
for longer than 72 hours.

307
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,380
On top of that, the
Inspector General found,

308
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,380
that the conditions under
which these children

309
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,650
were being detained

310
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:28,760
were below Customs and
Border Patrol standards.

311
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,620
At three of these five
border patrol facilities

312
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,010
that were visited, children
had no access to showers

313
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:37,810
despite CBP requirements
that reasonable efforts

314
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:40,110
be made to provide showers to children

315
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,370
who've been in detention for 48 hours.

316
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,670
Children had limited access
to a change of clothes,

317
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,862
and two facilities had not
provided any of them access

318
00:12:46,862 --> 00:12:50,570
to hot meals, as is also required.

319
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,660
For adults, the CBP requires
that reasonable efforts

320
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:57,280
be made to allow detainees
to shower within 72 hours.

321
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,310
According to the report, "most
single adults had not had

322
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:04,170
a shower in CBP custody
despite several being held for

323
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:05,990
as long as a month."

324
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:08,280
No shower, for a month.

325
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,620
Border patrol was giving
detainees wet wipes

326
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,410
to maintain personal hygiene.

327
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,650
Most single adults detainees
were wearing the clothes

328
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:18,070
they arrived in days, weeks,
and even a month prior.

329
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,870
Joining me now is someone
who's been inside several

330
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:22,721
detention facilities, and is very familiar

331
00:13:22,721 --> 00:13:26,090
with their conditions,
MSNBC's Jacob Soboroff.

332
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:29,130
Jacob, you have been reporting
this for a long time,

333
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,033
as have your colleagues here at MSNBC.

334
00:13:32,196 --> 00:13:34,350
Members of Congress have gone in.

335
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:37,030
The government's response
has been these are inaccurate

336
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,690
reports, it's not the case,
but now we've got this

337
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,090
Inspector General's report from the

338
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,800
Department of Homeland Security,

339
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,203
which directly contradicts
what the administration

340
00:13:47,203 --> 00:13:48,950
has been saying.

341
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:51,560
- Not only does this
Inspector General report, Ali,

342
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,080
directly contradict what Kevin
McAleenan has been saying,

343
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,880
and what the administration
has been saying,

344
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,550
the reporting Julia Ainsley
and I did on Monday,

345
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,810
also directly contradicts,
not in the Rio Grande Valley

346
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:03,200
sector, but in the El Paso sector.

347
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,670
We're seeing this in a systemic way

348
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,640
across different border patrol

349
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,320
sectors across the southwest border,

350
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,370
and that phrase ticking time bomb

351
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,400
is one that's getting
everybody's attention.

352
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,640
But I want people to
realize that this system

353
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,400
has been a ticking time bomb for decades.

354
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,445
You are housing migrants
who are coming here

355
00:14:20,445 --> 00:14:23,750
for humanitarian relief, in jail cells,

356
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,890
and that is something that
Kevin McAleenan, frankly,

357
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:28,560
has said, but it should
not come as a surprise

358
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,800
that anybody in this administration,

359
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,900
whether it's law enforcement

360
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,120
or in the political branch
of the administration,

361
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,220
that things are as bad as they are today.

362
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,360
This administration has made
things worse than ever before

363
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,610
by exacerbating crises on
the border by making people

364
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,540
wait in Mexico, by telling people

365
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,510
that they're going to be
mired at ports of entry,

366
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,850
by only allowing a limited
amount of people through

367
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:51,558
every single day, so you
have people that are crossing

368
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:54,270
illegally in order to
come in to this country,

369
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,250
and they're being detained
as if they are criminals

370
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,640
when all they want is
relief, like the relief

371
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,390
you were just talking about,
Danny Cevallos' asylum

372
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:04,833
protection, which is
an international right.

373
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,450
- Kevin McAleenan has
called for an investigation,

374
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,030
but it's not actually about this.

375
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:12,970
It's about a different
and related case in which

376
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:15,200
there was a secret Facebook
page that was discovered,

377
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,660
because somebody in it
leaked it to ProPublica,

378
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,508
indicating the culture
that at least some of these

379
00:15:21,508 --> 00:15:23,730
employees at CBP have,
because there are about

380
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,473
10,000 people on this page.

381
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:29,750
- The culture that you are
seeing emerge there, Ali,

382
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,380
is one that matches
directly the conditions

383
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,450
that you are seeing inside
these detention facilities,

384
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:41,450
and while we can't
ascribe the dehumanization

385
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,390
and the language that was
used in those Facebook posts,

386
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,620
to all the agents in the border patrol.

387
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:48,970
In fact I've met many
excellent men and women

388
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:51,220
who work for the border patrol.

389
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,790
You have to be alarmed by
what you are seeing here.

390
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:56,500
The combination of people
being held in conditions

391
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,030
like the ones we're looking
at on the screen, right now,

392
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:02,240
and the types of conversations
you are hearing from the,

393
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,300
remember these are law
enforcement agents, allegedly,

394
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,680
that are talking this way about people

395
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,710
they are supposed to be in
charge of, and supervising,

396
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,400
is incredibly concerning.

397
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,530
So, the acting Secretary
of Homeland Security,

398
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,790
Kevin McAleenan has
launched this investigation

399
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:21,050
from the Office of
Personal Responsibility,

400
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:23,880
and they'll look into
whether or not these agents

401
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,200
are meeting the standards
of the Department.

402
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,339
I think it's pretty clear
to see, just by reading

403
00:16:27,339 --> 00:16:29,210
some of what was on Facebook

404
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:31,113
and came out through ProPublica,

405
00:16:31,113 --> 00:16:32,880
that they certainly were not.

406
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,090
- Jacob, thanks for your
continued great reporting on this.

407
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:37,140
Jacob Soboroff for us in Los Angeles.

408
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,390
Joining me now is the Congresswoman

409
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,970
who led her fellow lawmakers

410
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:42,470
during yesterday's tour of
the largest child detention

411
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:46,360
facility in Homestead Florida,
Democratic representative

412
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,850
Frederica Wilson of Florida.

413
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:50,690
Congresswoman, thank you for joining us.

414
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:53,010
What'd you see when you were there?

415
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,040
- Thank you, Ali.

416
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:58,210
Well, I've been on this
mission for two years now,

417
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:02,100
trying to locate the girls
and do oversight over

418
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,240
adolescent girls, so I
went to Brownsville, Texas,

419
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,010
visited two facilities there,
I've been to Homestead,

420
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:12,550
and then I decided to
invite my follow colleagues

421
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:16,500
to go with me to Homestead,
just to keep up with adolescent

422
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:21,330
girls who should not be in
jail, and that's specifically

423
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:22,800
what they're in.

424
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:27,330
And they're just crowded,
thousands of young people

425
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:30,530
crowded, and noisy, in this jail.

426
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:33,093
That's what I call it, this is a jail.

427
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:40,310
They are in classes, but
I believe they should be

428
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,730
in public schools, and the bathrooms,

429
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,903
the only toilets they can use are outside.

430
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:51,750
Their dormitory is about
the size of a high school

431
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:56,750
gymnasium with just bunk
beds two feet apart,

432
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:59,290
where these children have to sleep,

433
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:02,610
and when they have to go
to the bathroom at night?

434
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:07,000
They have to get up and
go outside in the dark

435
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,370
in the night to go to the bathroom,

436
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:11,232
which is portable toilets.

437
00:18:11,232 --> 00:18:13,440
- Congresswoman, this is
a privately run facility,

438
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,090
in which we as tax payers
are paying them a day rate

439
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,240
to accommodate these students.

440
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,440
A rate that, in some of these cases,

441
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,750
has been surprisingly high,
in excess of $700 a night,

442
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,070
and they're sleeping in this way.

443
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,630
They're living in this way.

444
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:28,900
- It is unbelievable.

445
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,850
Some of them are sick,
influenza is all over the place.

446
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:36,410
They're suffering, crying,
they want to see their parents,

447
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:39,750
and the sad part about it,
the girls that I finally

448
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:43,800
got to see after demanding
and staying over two hours,

449
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,170
after everyone had left, to see the girls.

450
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:50,860
I saw this room full of 17 year olds,

451
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:54,900
and these young people are
actually waiting for the day

452
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,670
that they turn 18.

453
00:18:56,670 --> 00:19:00,420
And when they turn 18, they're
gonna shackle their wrists,

454
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,710
shackle their ankles,
and take them to jail.

455
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,360
And that is the saddest thing.

456
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,103
- What does success in this
situation look like to you?

457
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,810
- It's dire, because what
they're trying to do,

458
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:17,930
and what they're going to
do, is expand this facility,

459
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:22,930
instead of releasing these
children out of this facility,

460
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:27,390
giving them a home to wait on their cases,

461
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:30,230
and some of them have phone numbers

462
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:33,650
tattooed to their wrists,
some of them have little notes

463
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:36,120
that they could show me of aunties

464
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,500
and people who are waiting for them.

465
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,770
They're expanding this facility

466
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:43,550
and trying to take 1000 more.

467
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:47,050
They already have in
excess of 2000 children.

468
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:50,900
It is unbelievable,
unbelievable, and there's no way

469
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,680
to know whether these children

470
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,393

key primary states of Iowa,

Nevada, and New Hampshire.

596
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:52,390
Now we have new polling, all
showing former Vice President,

597
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:55,360
Joe Biden in the lead,
second place alternating

between Senator Kamala Harris

599
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,200
and Senator Bernie Sanders.

600

00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:03,165
Harris is closing the gap, up 13 points

602
00:25:03,165 --> 00:25:04,670

while front runner Biden
is down eight points.

604

Senators Elizabeth Warren
and Bernie Sanders follow.

623
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,070

here in West Des Moines
here this afternoon.

00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,000
and that conversation is,

630
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,070
what do you take as the
candidate from that debate stage,

631
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:11,070
where Kamala Harris
really, for the first time,

632
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,380
drew those contrasts with
Vice President Joe Biden,

633
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,890
and what does that
message look like out here

634
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:15,740
on the campaign trail?

635
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,240
Well, you could say this is the beginning

636
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,540
of the second inning, and
we'll continue to pay attention

637
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:22,290
to that as we go forward, and
what her messaging is here

638
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,123
to this Iowa crowd.

639
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,350
This is just the first stop
over the course of three days.

640
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,540
She'll then head to New Orleans,

641
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,220
and then she'll head to South Carolina

642
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,523
on Sunday and Monday, Ali.

643
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,340
- Vaughn, earlier when I
talked to you and I asked you

644
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,030
what Kamala Harris is going
to do to fill the space

645
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,890
between those moments
that she tends to have,

646
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:39,640
including the one on the
debate stage the other day,

647
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,940
that caused this increase in her polling,

648
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,313
you mentioned campaigning.

649
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:48,060
Does she have some sort of a
strategy as far as you know of

650
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,610
to maintain this momentum,

651
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:52,943
because part of it is that
so many more eyes are on her.

652
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,880
- Exactly and look at this.

653
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,330
A lot of this in places like Iowa,

654
00:26:58,330 --> 00:26:59,570
it comes down to television markets.

655
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:01,570
For example, right here
today we're in the Des Moines

656
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:03,550
television market, tomorrow,
she's gonna be over in

657
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:05,870
Council Bluff, the
Omaha television market,

658
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:08,380
on Friday, she's gonna
be up in Sioux City.

659
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,520
So, it's hitting those areas,
getting your message out.

660
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,207
Essentially bringing in local
television channels here,

661
00:27:13,207 --> 00:27:16,060
engaging, we expect to
talk with her again today,

662
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,070
and being engaging in that
conversation through it.

663
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,120
She raised three and
a half million dollars

664
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,230
over the course of the
three days after the debate.

665
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,970
That is, the campaign,
looks at that as help.

666
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:26,240
She now has 65 staffers as of today,

667
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,750
here on the ground in Iowa,

668
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,570
and so while she may make her stop here

669
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:32,050
in places like this, it's the staffers.

670
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,770
You can see the staffers with clipboards,

671
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:35,727
essentially getting the
names, phone numbers

672
00:27:35,727 --> 00:27:37,647
of people here and trying
to get them to commit

673
00:27:37,647 --> 00:27:39,530
to caucus, commit to volunteer,

674
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:41,830
because Kamala Harris as one human being,

675
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,110
can only do so much.

676
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:45,120
She's human, and then
it's a matter of putting

677
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,760
that operation in which,
the Kamala Harris campaign

678
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,750
believes they have a
real shot to win here.

679
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,880
As the polling suggests,
she's got a play to make.

680
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,650
Barack Obama won this place back in 2008.

681
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:56,271
She believes she can make that pitch here

682
00:27:56,271 --> 00:27:57,408
(crowd cheering loudly)

683
00:27:57,408 --> 00:27:58,710
and last point, you just heard the name.

684
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,450
A lot of times at these
events, Ali, it comes

685
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:01,524
down to local politics.

686
00:28:01,524 --> 00:28:03,940
The senate candidate on
the Democratic side who

687
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:06,300
will likely take on Republican
Joni Ernst, she's here

688
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,240
at this event.

689
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,060
A lot of it's local, bringing
in those folks, the state

690
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,960
legislatures, building those connections,

691
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,270
and being out there to
support them at the same time,

692
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:15,623
which Amy Klobuchar and
Senator Kamala Harris

693
00:28:15,623 --> 00:28:16,700
are here doing today.

694
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,660
- Vaughn, good to see you as always.

695
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,493
Thanks, friend.

696
00:28:18,493 --> 00:28:19,960
Vaughn Hillyard in Des
Moines, Iowa for us.

697
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,590
Former Vice President Joe
Biden also spending the day

698
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,443
in Iowa after his campaign
announced it raised

699
00:28:24,443 --> 00:28:28,730
21.5 million dollars
in the second quarter.

700
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:30,730
Just to compare that to Pete Buttigieg,

701
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:32,940
he brought in 24.8 million dollars,

702
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,900
Bernie Sanders, 18 million dollars.

703
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,085
NBC News corespondent
Mike Memoli is on trail

704
00:28:37,085 --> 00:28:38,740
with the former Vice President.

705
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:42,350
Joins me now from Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

706
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:45,338
Mike, it's a good fund raising haul,

707
00:28:45,338 --> 00:28:48,470
but by all accounts, last
week as these post debate

708
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:51,170
polls have come out, has not
been great for Joe Biden.

709
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,073
- Yeah, you're right, Ali,

710
00:28:54,073 --> 00:28:55,150
and this is something that we've seen

711
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,330
from the Biden campaign,
since really the start

712
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:58,330
of this campaign in April.

713
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:00,470
Anytime they've gone through
a little bit of a rough patch,

714
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:02,820
been dealing with some
sort of controversy,

715
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,410
they often try to pivot the storyline

716
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,000
back to a position of strength.

717
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,180
Sometimes, that's been by
returning the discussion

718
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,690
to a debate between Joe
Biden and President Trump.

719
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:14,610
That's of course the big
electability argument that

720
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:16,818
really is a cornerstone of Biden's support

721
00:29:16,818 --> 00:29:18,300
in a lot of these polls.

722
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,160
Today, as everyone's
getting ready to head off

723
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,140
to their holiday weekend,
and they are still dealing

724
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,170
with the fallout of that
shaky debate performance,

725
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:26,510
we saw the Biden campaign
take the opportunity

726
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,200
to put out that big fundraising number.

727
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,050
Yes, 21.5 million dollars.

728
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:32,597
It's not as high as what we
saw from Mayor Pete Buttigieg,

729
00:29:32,597 --> 00:29:34,550
but the Biden campaign pointing out

730
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:36,970
that they haven't been
in the race for the full

731
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:38,770
90 day period of that second quarter,

732
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:40,410
and so if you average it out, per day,

733
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:42,070
he did, in fact, raise more money

734
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,170
than any of the other contenders,

735
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:45,380
at least those from who we heard so far.

736
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:49,460
90% of that donations have
come from small donors,

737
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:52,540
from grassroots supporters
in less than $200 increments,

738
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,500
and we also know that
they've been doing a lot of

739
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,180
high dollar fundraising as well.

740
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:00,570
He has done some 27 big
dollar fundraisers so far.

741
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:02,270
What's important to know
and what Biden campaign

742
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:04,410
also wants to point out is that a dollar

743
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:06,860
for Joe Biden goes a lot
longer than it goes for,

744
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,370
a dollar for even a Kamala Harris,

745
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:10,770
who we talk about a lot on our air,

746
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:11,880
but maybe the average voter

747
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,350
doesn't have as much recognition of.

748
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,490
Biden is putting a lot
of that money early into

749
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:17,760
investments in the ground game.

750
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,550
They say they have 50
paid staff here in Iowa.

751
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,710
They just doubled their
senior staff in New Hampshire.

752
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:25,130
So, yes he'll spend a lot of
that on TV ads down the road,

753
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:26,390
but they're using a lot more of that money

754
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:28,310
in investment and infrastructure
than some of the other

755
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,380
campaigns who are gonna be
saving a lot of that for TV ads,

756
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,460
just so that voters get to know them.

757
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,500
- That's a good point, interesting.

758
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,333
Mike, thanks very much.

759
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:36,358
Mike Memoli in Waterloo, Iowa for us.

760
00:30:36,358 --> 00:30:39,970
The German government fined
Facebook over 2 million dollars

761
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:42,210
for under reporting the
amount of illegal content

762
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:44,100
like hate speech on its platform.

763
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,010
German authorities say
there were more complaints

764
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,540
about antisemitic content
than Facebook led on in a

765
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,320
recent transparency report.

766
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,580
The fine itself is small,
given the company's size.

767
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,580
It draws attention,
however, to the embattled

768
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:58,980
social media giant's clashes
with other world powers.

769
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,900
As the growing threat
of hate speech emerges,

770
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,130
this is a topic of
debate within governments

771
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,190
across the world.

772
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:05,750
We reached out to Facebook for comment,

773
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:06,900
but we have not heard back.

774
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,720
Joining me now is Rashad
Robinson, the President of

775
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,150
Color of Change, which
is the nation's largest

776
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:13,630
online racial justice organization.

777
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:16,530
He's met with Facebook's
Chief Operating Officer,

778
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:18,620
Sheryl Sandberg over a dozen times,

779
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,500
to discuss the issues facing the company.

780
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,333
Rashad, good to see you.

781
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:22,166
Thank you for being here.

782
00:31:22,166 --> 00:31:22,999
- Good to be here.

783
00:31:22,999 --> 00:31:24,900
- There's a context,
particularly in Germany,

784
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,410
where, as a result of the Holocaust,

785
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:29,387
they are hyper sensitive
toward hate speech,

786
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:32,470
and the degree to which it can catch on.

787
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:35,030
It does seem that the
Europeans are further ahead

788
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:37,140
than Americans are on
dealing with this issue.

789
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,880
- Absolutely, I mean, they are.

790
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,410
The fine, as you said, is small,
but the symbol of the fine,

791
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:45,460
the symbol of holding an
institution like Facebook

792
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:49,170
accountable, is serious,
and unfortunately,

793
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:54,170
we have not had that level
of oversight from the FTC

794
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,350
here, from congress, from the authorities

795
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:59,860
that are supposed to be stepping in when

796
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:02,469
institutions' communications
platforms, others,

797
00:32:02,469 --> 00:32:04,920
do not live up to our standards.

798
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,220
- Why do you think that is?

799
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,930
Is it a will thing, is
it an understanding?

800
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:10,240
- It's a couple of things.

801
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,560
First of all, it is
certainly a will thing.

802
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,573
It's a will thing when
it comes to congress.

803
00:32:14,573 --> 00:32:17,651
It's become politicized on both sides,

804
00:32:17,651 --> 00:32:20,780
and I don't wanna create
false equivalencies,

805
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,510
because the Republicans have controlled

806
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,230
the levers of power and
could have stepped in

807
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:27,150
after the 2016 election
and done a lot more.

808
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:30,730
The FTC lacks the type
of teeth that it needs,

809
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:33,210
and so what we've seen is them sort of win

810
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:35,470
settlements, or get fines,

811
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:39,850
and then not be able to
implement, or hold accountable,

812
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:42,870
once Facebook then goes back
and violates some of the things

813
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:44,397
that they were called out
on in the first place.

814
00:32:44,397 --> 00:32:46,290
- All right, so you have had conversations

815
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:47,890
with Sheryl Sandberg.

816
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:51,750
In fact, she's had something to say about

817
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:52,710
the census coming up.

818
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:56,145
Facebook wants to play a role
in ensuring that the census

819
00:32:56,145 --> 00:33:00,370
is completed properly, and
one wouldn't have thought

820
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:01,880
that's a problem, except
that in our world of

821
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,901
misinformation, you can
imagine people putting

822
00:33:03,901 --> 00:33:06,348
false news out about the
census and that, somehow

823
00:33:06,348 --> 00:33:07,860
messing up the count.

824
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,286
- Yes, you cannot fill out
your census on Facebook.

825
00:33:10,286 --> 00:33:11,970
(laughing)

826
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:16,500
But to that point, and this
was part of a long term

827
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,290
work we've been doing at Color of Change.

828
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:21,640
For the last several
years, we've been pushing

829
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,790
the organization to get
really clear about their

830
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:24,920
civil rights work.

831
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,310
Back in November, we got
them to commit to publicly

832
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,940
releasing their civil rights audit,

833
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,920
and they did the first phase in December,

834
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,240
which was really weak.

835
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,530
It didn't actually list
the structural things.

836
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:39,470
This last phase, that
they released on Sunday,

837
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:40,840
showed some more progress.

838
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,830
Since Sheryl Sandberg
has taken over the audit,

839
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:46,290
and put it under her office,
we have seen a marked

840
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,879
change in their commitment to actually

841
00:33:47,879 --> 00:33:49,890
trying to solve these problems.

842
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:51,700
For us, though, the metric of success

843
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,172
is a different type of experience.

844
00:33:53,172 --> 00:33:56,250
But as part of that, we
wanted them to really dig in,

845
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,150
not just into how they were going to deal

846
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:00,740
with this upcoming election,
but how do they treat

847
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:03,190
the census like an election, as well.

848
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:06,100
As a big event, where all sorts of forces

849
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,630
are going to try to come in,

850
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,910
because there's a lot at
stake, and influence it,

851
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:12,410
use racial appeals, use other things

852
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:15,020
to try to suppress
turnout, to try to suppress

853
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:18,720
participation, and so part
of this is that Facebook

854
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,790
makes a lot of money.

855
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:21,342
It's the largest communications platform

856
00:34:21,342 --> 00:34:23,570
in the world, and they
have a responsibility

857
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:26,330
to make sure that the
technology that moves us

858
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,850
into the future doesn't
drag us into the past.

859
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:29,781
- All right, so lets talk about this

860
00:34:29,781 --> 00:34:32,466
investigation that's
been ordered by the head

861
00:34:32,466 --> 00:34:34,340
of the Department of Homeland Security,

862
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:37,430
into the secret Facebook
post that had almost

863
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:39,390
10,000 people on it in
which they were saying

864
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:42,720
remarkably sexist,
misogynist, racist things

865
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,089
about members of congress, about migrants.

866
00:34:46,089 --> 00:34:47,850
It's 10,000 people.

867
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:50,430
We do not mean that to taint the good work

868
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:52,520
of those people in
Customs and Border Patrol

869
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,740
who are not involved in it,

870
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,500
but talk to me about how
you think about this.

871
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,700
This is a secret group,
who we only found about it,

872
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,230
because somebody in it
leaked this information,

873
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:03,110
because they thought it had gone too far.

874
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,770
Does Facebook have a role in that?

875
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,610
- Yeah, Facebook does
have a role in it 'cause

876
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:11,430
Facebook, these private
groups, they mine the data,

877
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:13,370
and then they mine the
data, and then they work

878
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:15,350
to make money off of that data.

879
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:18,230
So they've created these private groups,

880
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:20,970
and then they have
community standards about

881
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:24,450
hate, about what you can
say and what you can do

882
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:25,283
on their platform.

883
00:35:25,283 --> 00:35:26,960
- [Ali] And that applies even
if your group is private?

884
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,490
- It should, it does apply even it does,

885
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:32,210
and it needs to apply
no matter how powerful

886
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:34,063
the people who are doing it are.

887
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:38,730
The trick here is, it's
okay to have traffic rules,

888
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:41,480
but the traffic rules
only matter if they apply

889
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,190
to all of us, and the fact
of the matter is that these

890
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:47,200
private groups can
exist on their platform,

891
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,750
and then allow for the
type of sowing and creation

892
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,610
of hate, and then nothing happens.

893
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,220
Facebook has a role in this.

894
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,280
I also think that the
government has a role.

895
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,870
The fact that people felt so comfortable,

896
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,570
in a space,
- [Ali] Law enforcement

897
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:03,880
Law enforcement figures
that get a gun and a badge,

898
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,690
and are supposed to uphold
the laws of this country

899
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:09,410
felt so comfortable as
to say some of the most

900
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:14,410
hateful and derogatory
things about people in peril,

901
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,900
and elected officials of color, and women,

902
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,500
and felt like they didn't, 'cause they're

903
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,220
10,000 people in the group.

904
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,097
- Would they say it if they
didn't have a Facebook group?

905
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:24,820
In other words, did Facebook
make them say these things,

906
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:27,400
because these people had
racist, sexist, misogynist

907
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:31,020
things to say, so do we win
if we get it off of Facebook?

908
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,280
- No, but I think that we
have to recognize the way

909
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,608
that technology and new
tools allows for this thing

910
00:36:36,608 --> 00:36:40,263
to be, for this information,
to move quicker.

911
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,070
Lighting a match is one thing.

912
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:45,637
Lighting a match next to lighter
fluid is a different thing.

913
00:36:45,637 --> 00:36:48,250
And in many ways, whether
it's YouTube or Facebook

914
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:51,360
or Twitter, these platforms
can be the lighter fluid,

915
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:55,080
so that means we have
to keep an eye on it,

916
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,660
and we have to pay special
attention to how this

917
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,630
information can spread in different ways.

918
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:02,970
Yes, someone can say hateful
things out on the street,

919
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,910
and that's freedom of speech, and they,

920
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:08,620
not without consequences for
their job or the workplace,

921
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,660
whatever, but it's freedom of speech.

922
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,560
It's different when you go into a group.

923
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,450
You are a law enforcement figure.

924
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:17,680
You don't know the other
10,000 people on that group,

925
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,730
and you feel so comfortable
saying these things

926
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:22,030
and doing these things.

927
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:24,370
Yes there has to be accountability.

928
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:26,210
There's accountability for all of us,

929
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:27,060
in the workplace.

930
00:37:28,084 --> 00:37:29,470
- [Ali] Sure, if spoke
out on a group like that,

931
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:30,320
I'd probably get fired.

932
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,505
- You'd probably get fired, and
so the fact of the matter is

933
00:37:32,505 --> 00:37:35,860
why should we expect less from
our law enforcement figures?

934
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:39,780
Why should we let them off the
hook when it comes to this,

935
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:42,900
and especially as we see the
images, the horrific images,

936
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,290
that are coming from the border right now.

937
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:51,124
We wanna make sure the very
best people are engaged

938
00:37:51,124 --> 00:37:53,960
in this effort, and that's
not what's happening.

939
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,370
And the fact of the
matter is, is once again,

940
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:58,650
the technology that has so much potential

941
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:01,420
to bring us together
should not drag us in back.

942
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,253
- Rashad, good to have you here.

943
00:38:02,253 --> 00:38:03,403
Thank you for being with us.

944
00:38:03,403 --> 00:38:04,236
- Thanks for having me.

945
00:38:04,236 --> 00:38:05,069
- Rashad Robinson is the President of

946

Color of Change.

947
00:38:05,902 --> 00:38:07,100
All right, still ahead, Democratic voters

948
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:07,990
think it's a great idea.

949
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:08,823
Medicare for all.

950
00:38:08,823 --> 00:38:11,117
New polling shows there's a
lot of support for the plan

951
00:38:11,117 --> 00:38:12,440
within the party.

952
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,360
While some of the Democratic
candidates are already

953
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,180
campaigning hard on the issue,

954
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:19,010
others seem to be waiting
until the general election,

955
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:21,320
before they push hard on healthcare.

956
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,280
We're gonna talk about this
split strategy after the break.

957
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,533
You are watching MSNBC.

958
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:31,760
- [Narrator] The day after
chemo might mean a trip

959
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,210
back to the doctor's
office just for a shot,

960
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:37,970
but why go back there
when you can stay home

961
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:39,380
with Neulasta Onpro.

962
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:42,130
Strong chemo can put you at
risk of serious infection.

963
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:44,900
In a key study, Neulasta
reduced the risk of infection

964
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:48,922
from 17% to 1%, a 94% decrease.

965
00:38:48,922 --> 00:38:51,310
Neulasta Onpro is designed
to deliver Neulasta

966
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:54,280
the day after chemo, and is
used by most patients today.

967
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,230
- [Narrator] Neulasta is
for certain cancer patients

968
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:58,230
receiving strong chemotherapy.

969
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:00,110
Do not take Neulasta if
you're allergic to it,

970
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:01,760
or Neupogen, Fligrastim.

971
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,170
An incomplete dose could
increase infection risk.

972
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:06,710
Ruptured spleen, sometimes
fatal, as well as serious

973

lung problems, allergic
reaction, kidney injuries,

974
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:11,540
and capillary leaks
syndrome have occurred.

975
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,300
Report abdominal or shoulder tip pain,

976
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,850
trouble breathing, or allergic reactions,

977
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:16,220
to your doctor right away.

978
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,760
In patients with sickle cell disorders,

979
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,170
serious, sometimes fatal crises can occur.

980
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:21,550
The most common side effect is bone

981
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:22,710
and muscle ache.

982
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,200
- [Narrator] If you'd rather be home,

983

ask your doctor about Neulasta Onpro.

984

per dose with copay card.

touched on a number of major issues,

among them the economy,
immigration, healthcare,

1047

leaning voters, finds
that 89% of those surveyed

1053
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:28,640
said healthcare is their
top issue in the 2020

then the economy, foreign
policy, abortion, and taxes

1064
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,970
was of the least concern to
Democratic leaning voters.

Joining me now to take
a closer look at this

1066
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:59,130
is Dan Balz, Washington
Post Chief Correspondent.

1067
00:42:59,130 --> 00:42:59,963
Dan, good to see you.

1068
00:42:59,963 --> 00:43:01,610
Thank you for joining us.

1069
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:02,443
- My pleasure, Ali.

1070
00:43:02,443 --> 00:43:06,450
- Dan, the issue here is
healthcare, and how big a deal

1071
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:08,970
it is to Democratic leaning voters,

1072
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:12,290
and how many of them actually
support a Medicare for all

1073
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:14,650
proposal or some sort of it proposal.

1074
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:17,900
Morning Consult poll for
support of Medicare for all

1075
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:21,530
shows that of all voters, a small majority

1076
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:24,400
support a Medicare for all system, 53%.

1077
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,680
77% of Democrats do.

1078
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:27,840
Half of Independents do.

1079
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,670
And only 27% of Republicans do.

1080
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:33,179
So, it does seem that
support for Medicare for all,

1081
00:43:33,179 --> 00:43:36,350
or something like it,
is a winning strategy

1082
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:38,310
for Democratic candidates.

1083
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:40,710
- Well, I think there's three questions.

1084
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:43,670
One is where do people
stand on Medicare for all,

1085
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:45,720
or a government run single payer system,

1086
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,480
versus the current system.

1087
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,666
That's the first question
that people are asked.

1088
00:43:49,666 --> 00:43:53,290
The second is if you are in
favor of Medicare for all

1089
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:56,930
or a government run system,
would you be in favor of that

1090
00:43:56,930 --> 00:44:00,373
if you knew that private
insurance was gonna go away?

1091
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,120
What we found in our poll is
that there is overwhelming

1092
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,008
support within the Democratic party among

1093
00:44:06,008 --> 00:44:09,400
self identified Democrats
and Democratic leaning

1094
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,951
independents for Medicare
for all kind of program,

1095
00:44:12,951 --> 00:44:17,510
and that 2/3 of Democrats
say they would be in support

1096
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:21,263
of that even if it meant the
end of private insurance.

1097
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:25,440
Among the hardcore of the
Democratic party at this point,

1098
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,760
or among a broad scale
of the Democratic party,

1099
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,450
there's quite a lot of support for it.

1100
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:31,070
We know that among the candidates,

1101
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:32,640
there are divisions on that.

1102
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,300
Vice President, former
Vice President Biden

1103
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,580
is in one place.

1104
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:37,603
He is resistant to go that far.

1105
00:44:37,603 --> 00:44:39,990
Senator Sanders, Senator
Warren, and others,

1106
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:42,641
Senator Harris have come
down strongly in favor

1107
00:44:42,641 --> 00:44:44,860
of Medicare for all,
even if that does mean

1108
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:47,160
the end of private
insurance, although Harris

1109
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:50,020
has kind of equivocated
on whether she's really

1110
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:53,190
in favor of that or would
be in favor of maintaining

1111
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,410
some private insurance.

1112
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:57,040
That's gonna be the debate
that we're gonna see play out.

1113
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:00,490
I think that the question
for those who are opposed

1114
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:04,500
to Medicare for all, and an
end to private insurance,

1115
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,650
how strongly do they make that case?

1116
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:08,730
One of the things we
saw in the debate, Ali,

1117
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:12,120
was that Senator Bennet from Colorado,

1118
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:14,100
who opposes Medicare for all,

1119
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:16,341
made the argument that he is in favor of

1120
00:45:16,341 --> 00:45:19,970
reaching universal care,
but he thinks there's

1121
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:21,157
a more effective way to do it.

1122
00:45:21,157 --> 00:45:22,790
That's the debate we're gonna see.

1123
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:25,750
- And Dan, most developed
countries have some form

1124
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:28,730
of universal care, universal
insurance coverage,

1125
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:31,360
and there are many ways to get at this.

1126
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,560
My sense is that by coming
up for Medicare for all,

1127
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,870
which I happen to like as
a Canadian, 'cause it's

1128
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:38,650
very similar to a single
payer system in Canada,

1129
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:40,170
but it does sort of confuse the issue,

1130
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:41,670
because there are people
who say they're in favor

1131
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:44,680
of Medicare for all, and then as you said,

1132
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:47,460
when you add in, as your
poll did, add in the question

1133
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,990
of whether is that okay if
you eliminate your private

1134
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:52,260
insurance, I think it's a
lack of understanding that

1135
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:54,230
people have about the
various competing systems

1136
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:56,083
that are not the one we have now.

1137
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:59,620
- Well, there's always
going to be misunderstanding

1138
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:01,140
when you are talking about

1139
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:03,010
totally revamping the healthcare system.

1140
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:05,715
We saw that in the debate
over the affordable care act

1141
00:46:05,715 --> 00:46:07,500
during the Obama administration.

1142
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,820
We saw that during the
debate over universal

1143
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:11,700
healthcare during the
Clinton administration.

1144
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:13,665
Every time the federal
government and congress

1145
00:46:13,665 --> 00:46:17,732
have begun to tinker,
or radically change the

1146
00:46:17,732 --> 00:46:21,520
healthcare system, there is
a lot of misunderstanding.

1147
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,670
There are a lot of concerns
on the part of people

1148
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:25,500
who already have insurance.

1149
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,760
One of the realities is, as you know,

1150
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:31,929
under our Medicare system,
there is private insurance.

1151
00:46:31,929 --> 00:46:36,060
Most, if not all, Medicare
recipients have or need

1152
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:39,340
some kind of additional
insurance to pay for the costs

1153
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:40,900
that are not covered by Medicare.

1154
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,540
There are all these aspects of it,

1155
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:44,490
so part of it is a broad debate.

1156
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:45,683
What's the best way?

1157
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:49,250
I think one of the things I
think the candidates have heard

1158
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:52,060
on the campaign trail is,
beyond the question of what kind

1159
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:55,900
of system to do we have, the
question is what does it cost?

1160
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:57,010
How much does it cost,

1161
00:46:57,010 --> 00:46:58,757
and peoples' concern about rising cost.

1162
00:46:58,757 --> 00:47:01,100
That's another issue that
has to be dealt with.

1163
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:02,220
- So again, it's a little bit like

1164
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:03,570
the climate change debate.

1165
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:05,760
There's a question about what things cost,

1166
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:09,930
but there isn't a really good
actuarial or mathematical

1167
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:12,270
calculation of the cost of inaction,

1168
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:14,460
or the cost of the current system.

1169
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:16,760
Would it be easier for people to digest

1170
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,930
if this were well priced
out, the proposals

1171
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:20,940
were well priced out, and compared to,

1172
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:23,560
and this is what happens if you don't.

1173
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:26,710
- Well, that would be
great, but as we've seen

1174
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:29,330
in past debates, getting
those cost estimates,

1175
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:32,160
or getting people to agree
on those cost estimates,

1176
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,810
is a very very difficult proposition.

1177
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,272
You get them coming from
people with different

1178
00:47:37,272 --> 00:47:40,710
ideological viewpoints and
different political viewpoints,

1179
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:42,650
and different political interests.

1180
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:45,204
So, the debate over
what the actual cost is,

1181
00:47:45,204 --> 00:47:48,230
is as difficult sometimes
as what is the structure

1182
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:50,530
of a new system versus the current system.

1183
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:52,010
- Dan, great to talk to you, as always.

1184
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:53,530
Thank you for your
thorough coverage of this.

1185
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:56,577
Dan Balz, Washington
Post Chief Correspondent.

1186
00:47:56,577 --> 00:47:57,410
- Thank you.

1187
00:47:57,410 --> 00:48:00,180
- Coming up, honoring Luis
Alvarez, laid to rest today.

1188
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:02,460
He is a September 11th
first responder who fought

1189
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:05,770
for congress to extend health
benefits for his fellow

1190
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:07,500
9/11 first responders.

1191
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,500
After the break, I am
joined by Congresswoman

1192
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:12,660
Carolyn Maloney, who has
pledged to continue the fight.

1193
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:14,433
You are watching MSNBC.

1194
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:23,130
- [Narrator] When you shop

1198
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:31,933
- I'll take that!

1199
00:48:31,933 --> 00:48:32,820

1200

- [Narrator] When you want it.

1208
00:48:51,169 --> 00:48:53,550
- [Narrator] If you have
moderate to severe psoriasis

1209
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:58,450
or psoriatic arthritis, little
things can be a big deal.

1210
00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:00,290
That's why there's Otezla.

1211
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:02,990
Otezla is not an injection nor a cream.

1212
00:49:02,990 --> 00:49:05,710
It's a pill that treats differently.

1213
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:09,120
For psoriasis, 75% clearer
skin is achievable,

1214
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,820
with reduced redness, thickness,

1215
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:12,580
and scaliness of plaques.

1216
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:14,666
For psoriatic arthritis, Otezla is proven

1217
00:49:14,666 --> 00:49:17,480
to reduce joint swelling,
tenderness, and pain,

1218
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,320
and the Otezla prescribing information

1219
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,950
has no requirement for
routine lab monitoring.

1220
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:23,920
Don't use if you're allergic to Otezla.

1221
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,810
It may cause severe diarrhea,
nausea, or vomiting.

1222
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:29,800
Otezla is associated with an
increased risk of depression.

1223
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,250
Tell your doctor if you have a history

1224
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:32,950
of depression or suicidal thoughts,

1225
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:34,320
or if these feelings develop.

1226
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,630
Some people taking Otezla
have reported weight loss.

1227
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:38,070
Your doctor should monitor your weight,

1228
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:39,240
and may stop treatment.

1229
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,900
Upper respiratory tract infection

1230
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:42,080
and headache may occur.

1231
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,650
Tell your doctor about your medicines

1232
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:45,650
and if you're pregnant or planning to be.

1233
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:48,070
Ready to treat differently with a pill?

1234
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:49,853
Otezla, show more of you.

1235
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:53,310
- I switched to Miralax
for my constipation.

1236
00:49:53,310 --> 00:49:55,210
Stimulant laxatives forcefully stimulate

1237
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:56,460
the nerves in your colon.

1238
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:58,220
Miralax works with the water in your body

1239
00:49:58,220 --> 00:49:59,950
to unblock your system naturally,

1240
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:01,622
and it doesn't cause
bloating, cramping, gas,

1241
00:50:01,622 --> 00:50:03,590
or a sudden urgency.

1242
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:06,190
Miralax, look for the pink cap.

1243
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:07,920
- Cake in the conference room.

1244
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,610
- [Narrator] Showin' 'em you're
ready to be your own boss.

1245
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:12,370
That's the beauty of your smile.

1246
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:14,960
Bring out the best in
it with Crest 3D White.

1247
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,360
Crest removes 95% of surface
stains in just three days.

1248
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:21,320
Crest, healthy, beautiful smiles for life.

1249
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:24,210
- My mom hired Bathfitter
to make me a new bath.

1250
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:27,135
My friend Jimmy said that
when he got a new bath,

1251
00:50:27,135 --> 00:50:30,360
it took forever!

1252
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,393
Jimmy didn't have to
take a bath for a month!

1253
00:50:33,393 --> 00:50:35,770
I didn't even get to miss one bath.

1254
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:38,160
It's just not fair.

1261
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:53,238
- Hi.

1262
00:50:53,238 --> 00:50:54,071
- [Interviewer] Look
at how great you look.

1263
00:50:55,070 --> 00:50:56,110
- Thank you.

1264
00:50:56,110 --> 00:50:58,680
- I feel like I've been
on a diet my entire life.

1265
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,860
- I even cut out bread and pasta.

1266
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:02,693
For a day.

1267
00:51:02,693 --> 00:51:03,526
- And then I tried Noom.

1268
00:51:03,526 --> 00:51:05,060
- I feel like anyone could use Noom.

1269
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:06,720
- It's an easy to stick to program

1270
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,370
that actually changed my habits.

1271
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:09,780
It changed the way I look at food.

1272
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:12,430
- They say it's based on the
cognitive behavioral approach?

1273
00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:13,430
I just say it works.

1274
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:14,263
- It just clicked.

1275
00:51:14,263 --> 00:51:15,110
It worked.

1276
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:16,840
It worked with Noom.

1277
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,913
- [Narrator] Visit noom.com,

1278
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:22,700
- Last time I bought a used car,

1279
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:24,180
I ended up paying too much.

1280
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:27,610
It's pretty embarrassing
for me and my whole family.

1281
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:30,290
The car had multiple owners and accidents.

1282
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:32,020
That website didn't know.

1283

1291
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:52,890
- [Holt] Good evening everyone,
breaking news tonight-

1292
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:53,723
- [Narrator] Lester Holt.

1293
00:51:53,723 --> 00:51:55,220
- It sounds like a jet airplane out there,

1294
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:56,470
but that is fire-

1295
00:51:56,470 --> 00:51:59,280
- [Narrator] The most trusted
TV news anchor in America.

1296
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,200
- [Holt] That's nightly news.

1297
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,200
I'm Lester Holt-

1298
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,010
- [Narrator] More Americans
watch NBC News than any other

1299
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:05,653
news organization in the world.

1300
00:52:08,590 --> 00:52:11,020
- Hundreds gathered in
New York City this morning

1301
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:13,790
to mourn the loss of
a September 11th hero.

1302
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:17,458
53 year old NYPD Detective,
Luis Alvarez was laid to rest

1303
00:52:17,458 --> 00:52:19,840
in Queens, New York this morning.

1304
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,867
He died Saturday in hospice
care, following a three

1305
00:52:21,867 --> 00:52:23,327
year battle with cancer,

1306
00:52:23,327 --> 00:52:26,750
and more than 60 rounds of chemotherapy.

1307
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:28,682
Alvarez attributed his
cancer to the three months

1308
00:52:28,682 --> 00:52:31,930
he spent at Ground Zero,
following September 11th attacks,

1309
00:52:31,930 --> 00:52:33,370
digging through the rubble.

1310
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:35,450
He spent some of his final
days on Capital Hill,

1311
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:36,850
pleading for extended benefits

1312
00:52:36,850 --> 00:52:39,800
for his fellow 9/11 first responders.

1313
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:44,603
- I should not be here with
you, but you made me come.

1314
00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:50,160
You made me come because
I will not stand by

1315
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:55,650
and watch as my friends
with cancer from 9/11,

1316
00:52:55,650 --> 00:53:00,320
like me, are valued less than anyone else,

1317
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:05,320
because of when they get sick, they die.

1318
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:10,000
- [Ali] Among the many who
attended Alvarez's funeral,

1319
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,240
were comedian turned
activist, John Stewart,

1320
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,540
who joined Alvarez and his
fellow first responders

1321
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:17,170
on Capital Hill in the fight
for extended health benefits.

1322
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:19,790
You see Stewart here,
saluting Detective Alvarez

1323
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:20,810
in the final goodbye.

1324
00:53:20,810 --> 00:53:23,040
Next to him, you see
New York Congresswoman

1325
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,210
Carolyn Muloney, who was at Luis Alvarez's

1326
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:27,330
funeral this morning to pay her respects

1327
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:28,530
to the fallen hero.

1328
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:30,070
Congresswoman, thank
you for being with us.

1329
00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:31,760
- Well thank you for remembering,

1330
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:35,000
and thank you for remembering
Detective Alvarez.

1331
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,300
- [Ali] What was it like at the funeral?

1332
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:39,439
What was the mood, given that
he was a warrior, really.

1333
00:53:39,439 --> 00:53:42,150
- There was a tremendous
amount of support.

1334
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:43,750
The police department was there.

1335
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:46,050
Hundreds and hundreds of police.

1336
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:47,971
Not only from New York,
but from other areas.

1337
00:53:47,971 --> 00:53:50,000
His extended family.

1338
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,220
He was at the parish
that he was raised in,

1339
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:55,250
and many many friends were there.

1340
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:58,313
It was a huge community gathering.

1341
00:53:58,313 --> 00:54:00,690
- [Ali] He was born in Cuba,

1342
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:01,523
and came to American after that.

1343
00:54:01,523 --> 00:54:04,590
- About six years old,
but raised in Astoria,

1344
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:06,510
and this was his parish.

1345
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:07,800
So, he's the American dream.

1346
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:11,850
He came and as an immigrant,
joined the marines,

1347
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:15,120
joined the police force,
was a decorated officer,

1348
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:18,723
and a detective in narcotics,
and then later in bombs.

1349
00:54:20,145 --> 00:54:22,370
I'd say he's a hero, a true American hero,

1350
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:26,040
in working to pass the 9/11
Victims Compensation Fund.

1351
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:28,450
- You remember back to those days.

1352
00:54:28,450 --> 00:54:30,790
What did we get wrong
about this when it came

1353
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:31,870
to the first responders.

1354
00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:34,030
No one'll ever forget
that day, when people were

1355
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:36,070
running as far as they could
to get from those buildings,

1356
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:37,730
and some were lucky enough to get away,

1357
00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:40,140
and first responders ran the other way.

1358
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:41,090
They ran into it.

1359
00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:41,947
- They ran into it.

1360
00:54:41,947 --> 00:54:42,910
- And they stayed.

1361
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:46,610
- And we lost 3,000 people,
most of them responders

1362
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:51,390
on that day, and we will lose
many more, thousands more,

1363
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:53,300
because of those that worked at the pile.

1364
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:55,820
And it's a double outrage, in a sense,

1365
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:58,460
because not only are
they the victims of the

1366
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:00,350
war against terror,
but our government said

1367
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:01,370
come back, it's safe.

1368
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:02,460
It's safe, come back and work.

1369
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:03,460
Well, of course, it's not.

1370
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:04,920
- The EPA had said it would be safe.

1371
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:05,753
And many of these people,

1372
00:55:05,753 --> 00:55:07,170
we remember that plume that went on.

1373
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:09,420
It was much more than month that that-

1374
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:10,460
- It went on six months.

1375
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:11,687
- And you could see it.

1376
00:55:11,687 --> 00:55:12,770
You could smell it.

1377
00:55:12,770 --> 00:55:15,310
- You could smell it, it was horrible.

1378
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:17,590
- They worried about that,
they were going to do

1379
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:19,460
their jobs and they were going
to continue to do their jobs.

1380
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:21,180
They worried that they
were in danger at the time,

1381
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:22,970
and they were told by the
government that it was safe.

1382
00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:23,803
The federal government.

1383
00:55:23,803 --> 00:55:26,220
So for those who say this
was a New York problem,

1384
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:28,120
they were relying on
information from the federal

1385
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:30,040
government to say, you're
good, keep on working.

1386
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:33,040
- You've got it right,
and so not only do we have

1387
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,330
the responsibility as
they're the veterans against

1388
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:37,540
terror, but we also, they're the veterans

1389
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:40,210
of misinformation from the
government that they served,

1390
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:43,440
and we can never repay what they gave.

1391
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,360
Their life, their health.

1392
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:48,820
This is one way we can
make their lives better,

1393
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:50,620
and those of their
families that many of them

1394
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:53,360
are leaving behind, and they
aren't there to protect them.

1395
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:54,870
We need to give them some support.

1396
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:56,120
- [Ali] Do you believe
this is going to get done?

1397
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:58,100
- I believe it's gonna
get done, and I'm hoping

1398
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:00,710
we can get it on the floor
for a vote next week,

1399
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:02,036
and send it over to the senate where

1400
00:56:02,036 --> 00:56:05,150
Mitch McConnell says he hopes to pass it,

1401
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:07,770
and will pass it before the August recess.

1402
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:09,100
Let's keep him at his word.

1403
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:10,620
Let's get our work done in the house,

1404
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:12,640

determined that all federal

law suits could move
forward, against Monsanto,

1470

the maker of Roundup weed killer,

1471
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:59,850
over concerns that those

2018 for 289 million,

1478

by introducing the fuel
efficient K Car line,

1505
