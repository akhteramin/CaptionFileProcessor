2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:03,980
or you hit somebody.

3
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,070
They're coming to find out

4
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,570
where the last place you were was.

5
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,690

this is a wake up call.

7
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:12,960
Do your homework.

- [Joy] Yeah.

9
00:00:13,793 --> 00:00:14,740
- For everybody, don't just

10
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,290
'cause it looks like it's gonna be good

11
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:18,530
and you think they're gonna be there,

12
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,670
probably they're not gonna be,

13
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,310
so maybe want to save your
money and do something better.

14
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,140
- People lost over $20 million.

15
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,687

22
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,330
How does he answer critics
who say he'll derail Democrats

23
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,460
and hand Trump a victory?

24
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,513
He's live on The View, next.

30
00:01:01,607 --> 00:01:03,020

your friends were coming.

31
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:03,870
- Oh yeah.

32
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,690

a home and auto bundle from Progressive.

37

(singing in foreign language)

41
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,350
- My gums are irritated.

42
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,350
I don't have to worry about that, do I?

43
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,880
- Actually you do.

44
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,080

everywhere are confusing

Quilted Northern for robes.

51
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,283
They're cushiony, comforting,
and add elegance to your home.

52
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:48,033
But Quilted Northern is not a robe.

53
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,800

- Well, I think I would
have to be disingenuous

164
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,260
to run as a Democrat today

165
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,610
but I think the question
that I'm asking myself

166
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,870
and I think many of us
are asking ourselves

167
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,610
is what kind of country
do we want to live in

168
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,360
and right now I think it's clear

169
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,380
that the country we are living
in needs significant change

170
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,306
not only change because of this president.

171
00:06:00,306 --> 00:06:01,139
- [Whoopi] Right.

172
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,360
- But change because of the toxicity

173
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,370
and the lack of compromise of both parties

174
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,030
and we certainly saw that--
(audience applauds)

175
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,295
- [Whoopi] Right.

176
00:06:09,295 --> 00:06:11,540
- And we certainly saw
that over the last month.

177
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,180
The president was responsible
for closing the government

178
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,100
but 800,000 people and their families

179
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,430
were doing everything possible just to eat

180
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,680
and the Democrats as well as Republicans

181
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,470
are responsible for that.

182
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:25,303
- All right.

183
00:06:25,303 --> 00:06:26,136
- Well, I just want to ask quickly

184
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,280
what are the Dems too left on, you think?

185
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,310
What issues will not divide them?

186
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,690
- Well, I don't know Senator Harris but

187
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,080
listened to her last night

188
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,780
say we should abolish
the insurance industry

189
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,360
as a way to go forward on health care.

190
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,310
That alone would wipe out
millions of jobs of Americans

191
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,660
and that is the kind of extreme policy

192
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,660
that is not a policy that I agree with.

193
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,300
And if you take immigration,
you take health care,

194
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,390
what we have is extremes on both sides

195
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:59,970
not representing the large
majority of Americans

196
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,240
who don't have a voice

197
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,730
and what I'm saying is

198
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,760
let's give the American people a choice

199
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,440
and what better expression of democracy

200
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,620
and why should we only rely
on Republicans and Democrats

201
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,980
that have displayed not
only the last two years

202
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:16,580
but for decades, an inability
to do the people's work.

203
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,410
- All right, I'll tell
you why in a second but.

204
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,410
- Okay.
(laughing)

205
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,170
- I want to tell people
about you a little bit

206
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,720
because when I had it over at CNN,

207
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,900
I ran into Howard on the elevator

208
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,400
and I said to him, Howard get me a latte.

209
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,740
He's a Starbucks guy, right?
(laughing)

210
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,800
And I was teasing you.

211
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,700
And I went back to my office
and next thing I know,

212
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,280
he shows up, I have a picture of it,

213
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,860
he shows up with a latte.

214
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,901
Now, that's a great guy,
you know what I mean?

215
00:07:40,901 --> 00:07:43,980
That the CEO of Starbucks
delivers a latte to me.

216
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,090
Very nice and I also like the fact

217
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,760
that you gave insurance to
your part-time employees.

218
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,770
That was really sweet,

219
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,472
I mean that's a little above and beyond.

220
00:07:51,472 --> 00:07:54,380
But, but, and here's the big but.

221
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,213
- Okay.

222
00:07:55,213 --> 00:07:57,060
- Michael Bloomberg has
said to you don't run

223
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,210
and he was thinking of running

224
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,290
but then he did the research

225
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,490
and he found out he couldn't win

226
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,000
so he got out of the race.

227
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,830
The main thing and I said it yesterday

228
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,250
that scares me.
- Yes.

229
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,390
- Is that your entry into this race

230
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:10,140
will guarantee Trump another four years

231
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,590
and we cannot have that.

232
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:15,200
You talk about the Democrats
not wanting to negotiate.

233
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,820
They cannot negotiate with a toddler.

234
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,370
If you give him the cookie one day,

235
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,180
the next day he wants another cookie.

236
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,510
So that's not equal on both sides.

237
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,530
They had to play tough, the Democrats,

238
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,730
with him otherwise he will run amok.

239
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:30,820
Now your entry into the
race pretty much guarantees

240
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,497
that a Republican is going to win.

241
00:08:32,497 --> 00:08:34,157
And I know you're much more--

242
00:08:34,157 --> 00:08:35,101
- Joy, I do not agree with you.

243
00:08:35,101 --> 00:08:35,990
- I know you don't.
- I don't agree with you.

244
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,820
In fact, not only do I not agree with you

245
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,400
but I think if President
Trump runs against

246
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,450
a far left progressive liberal Democrat.

247
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:45,283
- But what if he runs against Biden?

248
00:08:45,283 --> 00:08:46,549
Biden's a middle of the road guy.

249
00:08:46,549 --> 00:08:48,000
- Biden hasn't come into the race yet.

250
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,300
But just let's finish.

251
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:53,200
If he runs against a far
left progressive person

252
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,200
who is suggesting 60, 70%
tax increases on the rich

253
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,230
and a health care system
that we can't pay for--

254
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,063
- [Whoopi] I don't know about that.

255
00:09:02,063 --> 00:09:03,540
- President Trump is gonna get reelected.

256
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,620
And all I'm saying is let
me go out to the country

257
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,560
and let the people hear my story.

258
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,770
I grew up in the projects of Brooklyn.

259
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:13,940
I gave my company
comprehensive health insurance,

260
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,450
equity in the form of stock options,

261
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,570
free college tuition for every employee

262
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:18,928
and I figured out--

263
00:09:18,928 --> 00:09:19,860
- But you can't do that with a country.

264
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,693
- Well, you can.

265
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:24,610
- No, listen you, because
this is the same problem

266
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,315
you know who has, when you look at--

267
00:09:27,315 --> 00:09:29,960
When you own your company--

268
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,793
- Yes.

269
00:09:30,793 --> 00:09:32,908
- You can make these changes
as you want them to be.

270
00:09:32,908 --> 00:09:33,741
- Right.

271
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:36,890
When you have to report to
the Senate and the Congress

272
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:39,970
and all the 50 million people
that come in the middle,

273
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,080
that's a little bit different

274
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,250
and so, you know, my big problem is

275
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,790
I want people to stand up
for what they believe in

276
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:51,830
and I think you are
you're saying to people

277
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,940
I don't think you'll hear me

278
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,250
unless I speak to you as an Independent.

279
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,540
I think if you believe
in what you believe in,

280
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,380
then stand up for that as a Democrat

281
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,450
and then change the party
if you feel like that.

282
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:07,086
As opposed to going elsewhere.
(audience applauds)

283
00:10:07,086 --> 00:10:09,518
That was what I wanted to finish saying.

284
00:10:09,518 --> 00:10:10,351
- Okay.

285
00:10:10,351 --> 00:10:12,060
Can I ask you all one question,

286
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,610
and maybe even the audience?

287
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:16,200
Does anyone believe the current system,

288
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,450
not only the President,

289
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,430
but the current political
system and our government

290
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:23,340
is working well on behalf
of the American people?

291
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,357
- Not since Obama was elected, no.

292
00:10:25,357 --> 00:10:26,190
- No.

293
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,269
- I do think it's the
best thing that we have.

294
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:29,590
- I think that it has to
do with money in campaigns

295
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:30,980
and money in politics.

296
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:31,930
And you're a glaring example

297
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,180
that as long as you're a billionaire,

298
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,110
you can run for anything

299
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,970
and my problem with politics right now

300
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:38,357
is the influence of
money and no shade at you

301
00:10:38,357 --> 00:10:39,830
but you do have to be a billionaire

302
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:40,760
to run as an Independent.

303
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,880
That's why Michael Bloomberg's

304
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,000
the other example you've given.

305
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
- Well, but you can't buy the presidency.

306
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,440
The American people are gonna decide.

307
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,336
But let me just let make one point.

308
00:10:48,336 --> 00:10:49,755
(laughing)

309
00:10:49,755 --> 00:10:51,668
Can I make one point?

310
00:10:51,668 --> 00:10:52,501
- Sure.

311
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:56,840
- In the last three or
four presidential elections

312
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:01,820
basically eight battleground
states decided the election.

313
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,160
That's a fact.
- Yeah?

314
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,750
- Now, if an Independent person
were to run for president

315
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,090
and get on the ballot of all 50 states

316
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,450
which if I decide to run,

317
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,500
we will be on the ballot of all 50 states.

318
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,440
For the first time--
- How?

319
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,640
- In almost 40 years, I'll get there.

320
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,400
For the first time in almost 40 years,

321
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,430
every state, every
person's vote, will matter.

322
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,620
It won't be eight states.

323
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,980
It'll be a 50 state race.

324
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,060
- As opposed to the electoral college?

325
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:26,893
- No, but--

326
00:11:26,893 --> 00:11:27,726
- So, it's a way of circumventing it?

327
00:11:27,726 --> 00:11:28,969
- No, it's not a way of circumventing it,

328
00:11:28,969 --> 00:11:32,410
because we could get to 270
because every state will matter

329
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:33,799
but the issue that I think--

330
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:34,821
- Every state does matter.

331
00:11:34,821 --> 00:11:35,654
That's why the Electoral College exists.

332
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:36,770
And I love the primary.

333
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,460
I love primary politics
and no disrespect to you

334
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,100
but you just went on
Gwyneth Paltrow's podcast.

335
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,100
You're here on The View.

336
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,780
All politics I believe,
should start local.

337
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,700
Why aren't you in New
Hampshire or Iowa, right now?

338
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,600
- You know what I wanna ask though, I.

339
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,930
- [Joy] He's selling a book.

340
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,670
- I know but if you're
running for president,

341
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,780
which I believe you are,

342
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:57,680
I still believe in the,
sorry Sunny to interrupt you.

343
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,310
I do, I truly believe in it.

344
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,890
And I actually think that like if like,

345
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,170
if you go to New Hampshire

346
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,880
which I've done, as have Abby,

347
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,050
these people take their vote

348
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,260
and they take their first in
the nation status seriously

349
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,520
and the idea that you negate their choice

350
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,250
and I'm not gonna concede that.

351
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,454
I still am fine with
the Electoral College.

352
00:12:14,454 --> 00:12:15,757
- I think you're misunderstanding me.

353
00:12:15,757 --> 00:12:18,130
I'm not saying anything
against the Electoral College.

354
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:20,580
What I'm saying is, if
it's a 50-state race,

355
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,540
you can get to 270, the
Electoral College applies.

356
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,460
With regard to New Hampshire and Iowa,

357
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,970
watch every Democrat go to those states

358
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,560
and have to be disingenuous

359
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,740
and probably make a false
promise about Fenton Hall

360
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,850
just to be able to get elected

361
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,690
in the primary in those states.

362
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:39,750
I would have to be
disingenuous as a Democrat

363
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,170
if I ran as a Democrat

364
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:44,300
because in order to run
as a Democrat today,

365
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,950
you have to fall in line with
free Medicare for everybody,

366
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:50,170
free, free college for everybody,

367
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,106
a free job for everybody, let me finish.

368
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:55,872
- That's what you just
said you gave everybody.

369
00:12:55,872 --> 00:12:58,730
- But not free for the for the government

370
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:02,600
and that totals about $40
trillion on top of the fact

371
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,410
that we are sitting on a $21 trillion debt

372
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,600
in the country today.

373
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,230
We can't afford to do it free

374
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,900
so it has to be a different way.

375
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,800
And the different way is
corporate responsibility

376
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,310
has to fall in line and
do more for their people

377
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,430
and the communities we
serve like Starbucks did

378
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,900
and pharmaceutical companies and lobbyists

379
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,560
that have been paying these politicians,

380
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,970
Democrats and Republicans have to stop

381
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,650
and can you imagine just
imagine for one minute

382
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:29,990
if an Independent person
could have a mandate

383
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:32,560
from the country, from the people,

384
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,670
the first one since George Washington,

385
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:37,800
to finally say to the system
and the special interests

386
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,340
it no longer applies,

387
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,990
that an Independent person
can break the logjam

388
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:45,399
of this toxicity that
exists in an unwillingly--

389
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:46,257
- [Joy] But that's where--

390
00:13:46,257 --> 00:13:47,360
- Hold on one second, we're almost done.

391
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,520
We're gonna be talking some more

392
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,066
with Howard Schultz when we come back.

393
00:13:50,066 --> 00:13:50,899
(audience applauding)

394
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:51,753
- [Meghan] I'm sorry.

395
00:13:56,467 --> 00:13:58,170
(music crescendos)

396
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,643
- I can do more to lower my A1C.

397
00:14:00,643 --> 00:14:03,800
- Because my body can still
make it's own insulin.

398
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,980
- And I take Trulicity once a week

399
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,240
to activate my body to release it,

400
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,830
like it's supposed to.

401
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,610
Trulicity is not insulin.

402
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,896
It starts acting in my
body from the first dose

403
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:17,340
and continues to work
when I need it, 24/7.

404
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,790
- [Announcer] Trulicity is an injection

405
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:21,680
to improve blood sugar in
adults with Type 2 Diabetes

406
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,600
when used with diet and exercise.

407
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,210
Don't use it as the first
medicine to treat Diabetes

408
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:29,840
or if you Type 1 Diabetes
or Diabetic Ketoacidosis.

409
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,050
Don't take Trulicity if you or your family

410
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:35,280
have medullary thyroid cancer,
you're allergic to Trulicity,

411
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,240
or have Multiple Endocrine
Neoplasia syndrome type 2.

412
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,820
Stop Trulicity and call
your doctor right away

413
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,460
if have symptoms of a
serious allergic reaction,

414
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,430
a lump or swelling in your
neck or severe stomach pain.

415
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:49,080
Serious side effects may
include pancreatitis.

416
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,950
Taking Trulicity with a
sulfonylurea or insulin,

417
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,870
increases your low blood sugar risk.

418
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:56,360
Common side effects
include nausea, diarrhea,

419
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,285
vomiting, abdominal pain
and decreased appetite.

420
00:14:58,285 --> 00:14:59,118
Do you.
