1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:02,710
- Darden Restaurants, I think that

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:04,100
that one is a good one right now.

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,910
I think they're going to
continue to raise and beat

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,980
in the restaurant sector
per my Analyst Lin Collier

5
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,447
at Luke Capital, we're going with it.

6
00:00:10,447 --> 00:00:11,280
- [Scott] All right Kate Moore,

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,113
always good to have you here.

8
00:00:12,113 --> 00:00:13,480
- Yeah, consumers what I'm watching

9
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,990
the most next week during earnings.

10
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:16,500
I think we're going to get
a lot of different reads

11
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,510
about the staples and
the discretionary side

12
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,880
with unemployment at
multi-decade lows, wages growing.

13
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,020
I think this is the big thing
that can change sentiment.

14
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,030
- [Scott] Okay, Weis,
quick, what do you got?

15
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,240
- [Weis] Illumina.

16
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,073
- [Scott] Josh Brown?

17
00:00:28,073 --> 00:00:29,537
- [Josh] I'm going with Twitter.

18
00:00:29,537 --> 00:00:31,620
- Motorola Solutions MSI.

19
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,530
- All right, good stuff.

20
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:33,400
Thanks everybody.

21
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,680
Good weekend, good holiday as well.

22
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,660
The Exchange starts now.

23
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,422
(upbeat music)

24
00:00:39,422 --> 00:00:40,260
- And thank you Scott.

25
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,630
Hi everybody, I am Brian
Sullivan in for Kelly Evans today

26
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,959
and here's what's ahead:
D.C. and Your Money.

27
00:00:44,959 --> 00:00:47,490
Politicians in America
will debate the meaning of

28
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,470
the Mueller Report, but we
ask could it lead to even more

29
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,210
gridlock and standstill in D.C.?

30
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:55,190
We're going to review the
impact on your money ahead.

31
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,810
Pinning and conferencing,
Zoom and Pinterest

32
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,195
hitting the market to a
lot of investor fanfare,

33
00:01:00,195 --> 00:01:02,611
but could they suffer
ultimately the same fate

34
00:01:02,611 --> 00:01:04,420
as Lyft shareholders?

35
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,429
Plus, a fold fail, a
cannabis consolidation,

36
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:09,687
a recyclable shoe, you heard that right,

37
00:01:09,687 --> 00:01:11,615
and a new legal smoking age.

38
00:01:11,615 --> 00:01:13,358
That's what's ahead in Rapid Fire.

39
00:01:13,358 --> 00:01:15,313
It's a big league show with lots to do,

40
00:01:15,313 --> 00:01:18,040
but as we always do let's
start with Your Money.

41
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,787
Dom Chu is here now with
a DOW that is up, what?

42
00:01:20,787 --> 00:01:24,212
- Almost 100 points and stable right now

43
00:01:24,212 --> 00:01:25,540
for the most part Sulli.

44
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,410
If you take a look at the markets overall,

45
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,680
nixed only because the
NASDAQ is lagging off

46
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,280
by about 1/10th of 1%.

47
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,200
Still though, the S&P
up by about three points

48
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,490
and the DOW Industrials just
about 100 points to the upside.

49
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:40,360
That's pretty decent overall,
we'll see if that sticks.

50
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,740
One particular industry group to focus on,

51
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,350
the transportation stocks.

52
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,850
The iShares Dow Jones Transportation ETF,

53
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,920
which tracks the Dow Transports,

54
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,990
right now the highest
levels that we've seen

55
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:53,790
going all the way back to December third,

56
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,790
so Transport's a big part of that story.

57
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,264
Union Pacific earnings
better than expected,

58
00:01:57,264 --> 00:01:59,140
that's driving the trade there

59
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,810
and if you're looking for
one of the stocks of the day

60
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,470
that's not Zoom, that's not Pinterest,

61
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,500
check out Blackstone.

62
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,369
Look at this, 8.5% gains.

63
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:10,423
A publicly traded partnership
for private equity

64
00:02:10,423 --> 00:02:13,600
that's going to become a
publicly traded corporation,

65
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,780
that new structure giving
a boost to those shares.

66
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,370
A lot more investors could come in the mix

67
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,010
and they raised a lot of money, Brian,

68
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,000
for their funds last
year, back over to you.

69
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,360
- Yeah, Schwartz been on Squawk Box

70
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,440
talking that up this morning.

71
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,204
Dom Chiu will see you in it
a bit, thank you very much.

72
00:02:25,204 --> 00:02:27,690
All right so and the markets that Dom

73
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,940
just walked you through
have two new members

74
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,478
to welcome into the fold today.

75
00:02:31,478 --> 00:02:32,910
Of course you've heard the names,

76
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:36,670
Pinterest and Zoom both are
now public, both rising.

77
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,030
Just adding to the list of names,

78
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,648
including some very under-the-radar ones.

79
00:02:40,648 --> 00:02:42,897
that have done very well
when they hit the tape.

80
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:45,820
Bob Pisani is at the New
York Stock Exchange with more

81
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,363
and Bob, Zoom, what a day.

82
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,053
- Both of them.

83
00:02:50,053 --> 00:02:52,440
I mean not only, the floodgates
have really opened Brian,

84
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,890
not only did they raise
the terms going into it

85
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,890
but they popped at the open as well.

86
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:57,900
Let's just take a look here.

87
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,110
Pinterest, very simple.

88
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:02,680
Price talk was 15 to
17, they priced it at 19

89
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,492
but wait a minute, it opened at $23.75

90
00:03:05,492 --> 00:03:07,650
and take a look at it in
intraday trading here,

91
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:08,950
on very heavy volume here,

92
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,750
they're gonna trade the whole float today.

93
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,099
It's holding up very well, up $24.35.

94
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:16,240
Zoom though, 28 to 32.

95
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,870
Just four or five days
ago we were talking about

96
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,490
28 to 32 for Zoom.

97
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,488
It priced at 36, that's not a typo.

98
00:03:22,488 --> 00:03:24,482
It opened at $65.

99
00:03:24,482 --> 00:03:26,690
This is very rare to see something

100
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,280
that essentially opens twice as high

101
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,320
as anybody thought it would a week ago

102
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,273
and you see a trading right here at $63,

103
00:03:33,273 --> 00:03:34,320
just off that number.

104
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,500
Of course it's profitable,

105
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,960
A lot of people like that.

106
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,020
It's got 100% growth and
those are the two magic words

107
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:40,853
that we've got.

108
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:42,569
Recent IPOs that joins the parade,

109
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:44,430
they've done really well.

110
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,560
Jumia, PagerDuty, Tufin, Levi Strauss,

111
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,240
which is one of the few
profitable companies,

112
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,073
all doing great.

113
00:03:50,073 --> 00:03:52,590
Lyft is one of the few
companies still to the downside.

114
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,750
No companies next week Brian

115
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,216
but the week after we'll
probably get another slew,

116
00:03:56,216 --> 00:04:00,342
maybe iHeartMedia, maybe next
Friday a week from tomorrow,

117
00:04:00,342 --> 00:04:04,090
maybe we'll get Uber giving us some terms.

118
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,764
We'll see, not quite sure yet about that.

119
00:04:05,764 --> 00:04:08,360
- Big stuff there Bob
Pisani, thank you very much.

120
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,520
All right now to Washington

121
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,826
because the other big
thing to hit the tape today

122
00:04:12,826 --> 00:04:14,640
was the Mueller Report.

123
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,290
It is perhaps more heavily
redacted than many had thought

124
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,001
or hoped, but at 400 or so pages long

125
00:04:20,001 --> 00:04:22,330
our team is still pouring through it.

126
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,770
Eamon Javers live at the White House

127
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,610
with what we have learned so far.

128
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,090
Eamon, your key takeaways.

129
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:27,923
- Yeah, Brian that's right.

130
00:04:27,923 --> 00:04:31,300
We are still trying to
digest this 400 page report

131
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,900
and going through it for
all of the details here.

132
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,230
The headline is out there

133
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,660
and the President's been
saying that throughout the day,

134
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,980
no collusion, no obstruction.

135
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,970
That's good news for this White House.

136
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,110
Inside the document we're finding

137
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,560
some of the areas of
concern for Robert Mueller

138
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,955
particularly around the area
of potential obstruction

139
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:50,720
of justice and the
President's public statements,

140
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,510
his tweets even about some of the people

141
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,273
involved in this whole situation,

142
00:04:55,273 --> 00:04:57,350
those were red flags from Robert Mueller

143
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,320
in certain circumstances.

144
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,103
Particularly on this idea.

145
00:05:03,552 --> 00:05:06,260
- All right so when we get Eamon back up,

146
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,940
we're gonna come back
and talk more about that

147
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,773
certainly here.

148
00:05:08,773 --> 00:05:11,250
Somebody pulled the plug
literally on Eamon there as well,

149
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,680
but luck we've got a couple smart folks

150
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,600
surrounding us right now
to dig more into this.

151
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,730
Let's talk more about what
this all means for Washington,

152
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,020
the markets, and policy going forward.

153
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,830
We're gonna CNBC this story.

154
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,330
Let's bring in Libby Cantrell
Head of Public Policy

155
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:24,250
at PIMCO.

156
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,470
CNBC's own Ron Insana
and John Harwood as well.

157
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,988
Libby, I'll begin with you.

158
00:05:28,988 --> 00:05:31,150
The Democrats are gonna complain,

159
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,360
it's too heavily redacted.

160
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,960
We need to investigate further.

161
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,980
Republicans will say this is all over.

162
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,590
What we're probably going to
end up with is a bunch of this.

163
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,720
Where do you see policy
making, infrastructure,

164
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,320
anything else, going forward?

165
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,910
- Yeah, I mean I think
this is hitting through

166
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:46,776
a partisan lens.

167
00:05:46,776 --> 00:05:49,380
I mean to your point
Republicans are sort of

168
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,103
claiming vindication here,
that there is no collusion,

169
00:05:52,103 --> 00:05:54,920
and Democrats may walk through the door

170
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,320
that the Mueller report opened in terms of

171
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,330
investigating further,

172
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,250
whether there is actually
obstruction of justice.

173
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,276
I think you'll hear louder calls

174
00:06:02,276 --> 00:06:06,320
for even then maybe the
beginnings of impeachment hearings

175
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,180
for the President among
the progressive left.

176
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,190
Now I think Speaker
Pelosi will do everything

177
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,362
that she can to try to
not heed those calls,

178
00:06:12,362 --> 00:06:14,640
but the point is that look,

179
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,549
I mean Washington has already
been, is already polarized.

180
00:06:17,549 --> 00:06:19,358
It is already partisan.

181
00:06:19,358 --> 00:06:22,777
There was not much moving
legislatively anyway,

182
00:06:22,777 --> 00:06:25,310
but the big things that President Trump

183
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,800
does want to move legislatively,

184
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,866
one is is the NAFTA replacement,
the USMCA, NAFTA 2.0.

185
00:06:30,866 --> 00:06:34,046
And that might be harder to move now

186
00:06:34,046 --> 00:06:36,640
with a more kind of
fractured relationship--

187
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,720
- Do you believe that Ron,

188
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,140
to Libby's point that this
report will in some ways

189
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:45,000
infect what should be
bipartisan or nonpartisan

190
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,770
purely economic negotiations?

191
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,330
- Yeah, I don't think there's any escaping

192
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,260
maybe the overhang that Libby alluded to,

193
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,394
which is that within the
obstruction of justice component

194
00:06:54,394 --> 00:06:58,301
of this report Bob Mueller
effectively punted to Congress

195
00:06:58,301 --> 00:07:00,930
and suggested in the
absence of his being able

196
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,360
to do anything under the
Office of Legal Counsel,

197
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,180
which says you cannot
indict a sitting President.

198
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,973
He really suggested that
Congress, to a certain extent,

199
00:07:07,973 --> 00:07:09,050
take this up.

200
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,890
So to the extent that
they're not only one,

201
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,460
maybe distracted or even obsessed by this,

202
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,884
it will slow down the legislative process

203
00:07:14,884 --> 00:07:17,980
and create even more I think fractures

204
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,377
between the Democrats in the House

205
00:07:20,377 --> 00:07:21,580
and the White House itself.

206
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,140
- You know John when
Barr's letter came out,

207
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,240
the four pager, people
said okay this is over.

208
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,771
It appears to what Ron
is maybe suggesting that

209
00:07:27,771 --> 00:07:32,300
maybe we are just getting started
on a second phase of this.

210
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,550
- Well I think that's
because Barr's letter

211
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:39,153
was such a brief summary of
this and the report today

212
00:07:39,153 --> 00:07:42,700
gives us a lot more
detail as Eamon was saying

213
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,489
before somebody pulled the plug,

214
00:07:44,489 --> 00:07:49,489
that a lot of detail about
the potential obstruction

215
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,501
that the President had engaged in

216
00:07:51,501 --> 00:07:55,300
orders to Don McGahn then
the White House Counsel

217
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:59,180
to direct Rod Rosenstein
to fire Robert Mueller.

218
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,802
The special counsel began
refusing offering his resignation

219
00:08:03,802 --> 00:08:06,830
then ultimately staying on a while longer

220
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,750
and telling aides that Trump had asked him

221
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,077
to do crazy stuff.

222
00:08:10,077 --> 00:08:15,077
I think all of that and
to Libby's point earlier,

223
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,710
I think it was the right one.

224
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:20,710
I believe that the way the
administration through Bill Barr

225
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:24,150
in the initial release of the letter

226
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,845
and then today's press conference

227
00:08:25,845 --> 00:08:29,350
in which he seemed to be
spinning for the President

228
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:32,460
trying to blunt the impact of the report,

229
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,350
I think that's going to
make it more difficult

230
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:38,130
for Speaker Pelosi to
resist those in her caucus

231
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:41,572
who insist on an impeachment
proceeding to weigh this

232
00:08:41,572 --> 00:08:46,572
in a way that they think
is searching and fair.

233
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,758
- Yeah, and Eamon Javers by
the way is alive and well.

234
00:08:49,758 --> 00:08:50,617
(laughing)

235
00:08:50,617 --> 00:08:51,850
I just want to point that out he is back.

236
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:54,210
Somebody pulled the plug,
but not on him literally.

237
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:55,043
So Eamon--

238
00:08:55,043 --> 00:08:55,967
- There's no censorship here.

239
00:08:55,967 --> 00:08:57,910
- No censorship here, he
is back with us as well.

240
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:58,800
- He's not redacted.

241
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,470
- You know you've been
there day in and day out

242
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,303
for us Eamon.

243
00:09:01,303 --> 00:09:03,950
You've seen the sort of the
back and the forth inside.

244
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:06,680
You know the Speaker's
chamber and talking about this

245
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,874
with Sarah Sanders and and one wonders

246
00:09:08,874 --> 00:09:12,080
how much more of any dialogue that we have

247
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,490
is simply going to be about
the report from now on?

248
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,530
The administration can want
to talk about defense spending

249
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:20,046
or infrastructure or
immigration or whatever it is

250
00:09:20,046 --> 00:09:23,917
and every question is going
to go back to this report

251
00:09:23,917 --> 00:09:25,698
with the exception of maybe yours.

252
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,210
- Well, you know that's right.

253
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,790
I mean first of all this is a White House

254
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,350
that doesn't brief the
press any more, right?

255
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,071
So they're not going to face
this public televised spectacle

256
00:09:33,071 --> 00:09:35,560
of the White House trying to
get out its line of the day

257
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,960
and reporters just asking them
on camera about the report.

258
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,890
You're gonna see the
President leaving here

259
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,920
shortly this afternoon a couple of hours

260
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,670
and reporters will ask him questions.

261
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,680
I expect he will talk.

262
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,410
He's been tweeting vigorously today.

263
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,860
He has a lot he wants to say about this,

264
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,590
so I expect we're gonna
get lengthy comments

265
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,661
from the President today.

266
00:09:52,661 --> 00:09:53,930
But in talking to some
of the officials here,

267
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,970
I don't get the sense that
they're gonna rebut much

268
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:56,803
of this at all.

269
00:09:56,803 --> 00:09:58,734
It's possible that they're
just gonna let this sit

270
00:09:58,734 --> 00:10:02,640
and retreat to the headline
conclusion of no collusion,

271
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,370
no obstruction and on
some of the smaller things

272
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,280
just let all those go.

273
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,870
For example, there's some stuff
in here about Sarah Sanders

274
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,570
and exactly how she
responded to the Comey firing

275
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:15,525
by suggesting that FBI
agents inside the bureau

276
00:10:15,525 --> 00:10:17,267
had lost confidence in Comey

277
00:10:17,267 --> 00:10:20,322
and that they'd heard from
countless members of the FBI

278
00:10:20,322 --> 00:10:22,728
who said that they didn't like Comey.

279
00:10:22,728 --> 00:10:26,120
Apparently in her interview
with the special counsels team,

280
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,310
she admitted that you know
that didn't have any basis

281
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:30,103
in fact and it was either
a slip of the tongue

282
00:10:30,103 --> 00:10:33,131
or she just kind of said it at the time

283
00:10:33,131 --> 00:10:37,122
and didn't really base it
on any actual factual basis.

284
00:10:37,122 --> 00:10:40,055
Those smaller things it doesn't seem like

285
00:10:40,055 --> 00:10:41,970
the White House is
going to address at all.

286
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,840
They might just let them all go.

287
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,180
They're content with the win here

288
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,650
and they feel like they've had
a big positive political day.

289
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,890
- Yeah and Brian I'm not sure
how much of a win there is.

290
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,250
I mean I got through about the
first 50 pages of the report

291
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,530
and there's some even
materiality when it comes to

292
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,363
the question of whether
or not the administration

293
00:10:56,363 --> 00:10:59,587
or I should say the
campaign expected to benefit

294
00:10:59,587 --> 00:11:02,250
from Russia's actions in interfering.

295
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,360
Not rising to the level of criminality,

296
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,000
which Robert Mueller suggested,

297
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,530
but from a market perspective
this may as Amy just alluded,

298
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:12,237
in many ways turn neutral insofar as

299
00:11:12,237 --> 00:11:16,310
we're seeing a
resynchronization of let's say

300
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,410
Chinese and American economic growth.

301
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,280
Europe's the outlier at the moment.

302
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,570
We're seeing the Fed back off,

303
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:22,970
we're seeing central
banks around the world

304
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,010
start to stimulate.

305
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,670
So if indeed today's retail sales number

306
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,663
were any indication of
where we're going from here

307
00:11:27,663 --> 00:11:31,320
then the market may just
return it's attention

308
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,540
to fundamentals and maybe ignore some--

309
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,072
- Ron, dang you for bringing
right back down the CNBC lane

310
00:11:36,072 --> 00:11:38,690
because that was perfect and
I want to talk about that.

311
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,859
It's amazing, the retail sales
number better than expected.

312
00:11:40,859 --> 00:11:43,556
Jobless claims under 200000.

313
00:11:43,556 --> 00:11:46,970
GDP revisions, they are
going up at Goldman Sachs

314
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:47,840
and others today Libby.

315
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,667
It's amazing that this is
getting all the headlines

316
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:52,610
and if you just focused
on this you'd think

317
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:54,639
this is the only thing
happening but outside of this

318
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,643
America rolls on and the economy rolls on

319
00:11:57,643 --> 00:11:59,880
and the President will
have a strong economy

320
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,290
most likely behind him in that reelection.

321
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,820
- Yeah, most likely and our view of him,

322
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,538
is that we likely will see sort of two,

323
00:12:07,538 --> 00:12:11,540
2.5% growth here in the
United States for 2019.

324
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,679
You do have the effect
of fading fiscal stimulus

325
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:16,799
and you got a big fiscal
impulse growth from the tax bill

326
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:18,840
that was passed in at late 2017

327
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,730
and then also a big
government spending bill

328
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:22,390
that was passed in 2018.

329
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,800
From a policy perspective

330
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,940
and from kind of tying
this back to markets,

331
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,890
another area though of
this kind of Mueller report

332
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,850
that could inform relations with Congress,

333
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,720
that could be relevant, is this idea of

334
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,900
the fiscal cliff of 2020.

335
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,623
And the markets are not
focused on this right now,

336
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:38,650
this is something we're
talking about with per clients

337
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,585
and talking at PIMCO go
about and that's because

338
00:12:40,585 --> 00:12:44,550
if Congress doesn't step
it and keep spending levels

339
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,998
at the rate that they are now,

340
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:50,212
come January 1st of 2020 we
could see a half a percent

341
00:12:50,212 --> 00:12:53,230
headwind to economic growth
because of this big drive down

342
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,063
in spending now.

343
00:12:54,063 --> 00:12:56,480
I think we all, Washington
folks are you know,

344
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,400
understand that Congress is expedient.

345
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,921
They're going to want not want
to do that going into it--

346
00:13:00,921 --> 00:13:01,754
- Well they may want to do that.

347
00:13:01,754 --> 00:13:03,860
- John Harwood, John Harwood.

348
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,000
- Brian, I just wanted to make one point,

349
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,110
which is that in terms of the effect

350
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,360
on the legislative agenda,

351
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,932
there really isn't much
of a legislative agenda.

352
00:13:12,932 --> 00:13:16,751
In theory the administration
wants an infrastructure plan,

353
00:13:16,751 --> 00:13:19,392
but Republican leaders in Congress don't

354
00:13:19,392 --> 00:13:22,660
and the kind of plan the
administration wants is not

355
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,710
what Democrats want so
other than the USMCA,

356
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,033
which is significant,

357
00:13:28,033 --> 00:13:31,750
there isn't much that congress might do

358
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,430
in the absence of this Mueller report

359
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,840
so I think that's important and--

360
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,880
- John, let me ask you, let
me ask you Libby's point

361
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,610
if I can because we're
running out of time.

362
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,424
Do you, to the fiscal cliff discussions,

363
00:13:40,424 --> 00:13:43,780
do you believe it's not
only because the report

364
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,540
but maybe the report layers on,

365
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,546
that the US Congress,
Democrats and Republicans both,

366
00:13:48,546 --> 00:13:52,578
will play economic chicken
with the fiscal cliff

367
00:13:52,578 --> 00:13:54,464
and the US economy?

368
00:13:54,464 --> 00:13:55,863
- I doubt it.

369
00:13:55,863 --> 00:13:58,780
I don't think Democrats
approach these issues

370
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,390
differently from Republicans

371
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:03,410
and while they'll fight for
their policy priorities,

372
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:06,530
I don't think that a
Nancy Pelosi led House

373
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:09,939
would engage in the degree of brinkmanship

374
00:14:09,939 --> 00:14:11,900
that we've seen in the recent past.

375
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,733
- Let's hope.

376
00:14:12,733 --> 00:14:13,830
535 men and women fighting

377
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,940
while 310 million others may suffer.

378
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,480
John Thank You, Eamon thank you,

379
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,950
I'm glad to see you're alive and well.

380
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:21,370

Should you get in?

391
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:51,660
And could 21 soon be the new
18 when it comes to tobacco?

392
00:14:51,998 --> 00:14:53,483
We'll explain.

- If you bought a
timeshare for your family

427
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:40,690
by now you've learned the ugly truth.

428
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:43,210
Timeshares are the only
thing that you can buy

429
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,320
that you don't know how
much it's going to cost

430
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,050
or when it's going to end.

431
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:50,070
It's like giving them a blank
check for annual maintenance

432
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,410
and assessment fees.

433
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,930
Sounds crazy, right?

434
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:55,850
The ugly truth is that this never ends.

435
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,610
Even when you die your family

436
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,200

- Hi, welcome back.

454
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,410
With so much talk about the possibility

455
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,610
of an economic slowdown
it's important to look

456
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:47,240
beyond just the government data.

457
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,852
Jim Cramer told you as much
on Mad Money the other night.

458
00:17:49,852 --> 00:17:52,120
So let's do more of that by diving into

459
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,490
BB&T's latest quarter.

460
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,320
Joining us exclusively on
The Exchange is Kelly King,

461
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,210
the Chairman and CEO of BB&T.

462
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,942
Kelly it's great to
have you on the program.

463
00:18:00,942 --> 00:18:04,166
So much discussion about a
possibility of a slowdown.

464
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,963
How is BB&T seeing loan demand?

465
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,210
- Well glad to be back.

466
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,413
Long demand is actually very good.

467
00:18:13,413 --> 00:18:17,707
Actually production is very high.

468
00:18:17,707 --> 00:18:21,080
Our pipeline where we kind of measure

469
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,550
all of the applications in process

470
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,243
are at an all-time high

471
00:18:25,243 --> 00:18:29,610
and so we're seeing a
broad-based level of confidence,

472
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,810
a broad-based level of
willingness to borrow money,

473
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,917
to invest in plant and capital equipment.

474
00:18:35,917 --> 00:18:38,670
So overall it's very good.

475
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:42,010
You know on the street doesn't match up

476
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:45,080
with a lot of the kind of
national rhetoric that you hear.

477
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,160
- And in your experience,

478
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,334
your long history Kelly running a bank,

479
00:18:48,334 --> 00:18:51,554
do people borrow money,
do businesses borrow money

480
00:18:51,554 --> 00:18:54,573
when they sense a slowdown is imminent?

481
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,340
- They do.

482
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,300
Brian, it's interesting.

483
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,260
- They do?!

484
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,158
- Yeah, they do.

485
00:19:00,158 --> 00:19:04,840
I travel around and I talked
to lots of business people

486
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:09,100
one on one and so when I talked to them

487
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,590
they talk about their business.

488
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:14,762
They're interested in chatting
about the national issues

489
00:19:14,762 --> 00:19:17,010
but when you get right down
to what they're going to do,

490
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,150
they focus on their business.

491
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,560
So if their actual market,

492
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,710
if their actual business is slowing down

493
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:26,830
then of course they'll
reduce their investment.

494
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,056
But if it's just a lot
of general conversation,

495
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:30,782
you know they'll talk about it,

496
00:19:30,782 --> 00:19:32,960
it might cause them some uneasiness,

497
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,728
but when they go right back to the office

498
00:19:34,728 --> 00:19:37,040
they'll focus on running their business.

499
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,820
- From all the numbers
though in the quarter

500
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,100
and the year so far
Kelly that you have seen

501
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,264
do you believe we will be in a
recession in 12 to 18 months?

502
00:19:45,264 --> 00:19:48,321
- You know, I actually do not.

503
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:52,430
I'd be honest six or eight nine months ago

504
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:55,460
I was a lot more concerned
about the possibility of that.

505
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,836
There was just so much rhetoric
about it's been 10 years

506
00:19:58,836 --> 00:20:02,640
and after a while everybody
begins to you know,

507
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,108
have that effect you a bit.

508
00:20:04,108 --> 00:20:05,820
But as I've gotten out and traveled around

509
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,310
and talked to business people
and I've seen the strength.

510
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,110
I mean just what you've been reporting

511
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,400
just in the last hour so.

512
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,821
Strong retail sales, low
unemployment, low jobless claims,

513
00:20:14,821 --> 00:20:19,820
underlying strong GDP, no
major geopolitical risk,

514
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,684
it seemed to be eminently problematic.

515
00:20:22,684 --> 00:20:26,950
I don't see, in certainly
the next 12 to 18 months

516
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:29,576
I do not see and eminent slowdown.

517
00:20:29,576 --> 00:20:33,090
I think that you could have
some existential factors

518
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:35,580
that could cause that but I don't think

519
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,520
it's predictable at this time.

520
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,020
- One thing that stood out to me

521
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,030
that was a little bit
shocking I guess Kelly,

522
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:43,220
is that your net interest margin, NIM,

523
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,847
rose only two bits. (laughs)

524
00:20:45,847 --> 00:20:48,760
Literally a tiny percent.

525
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,593
- We take what we can get.

526
00:20:49,593 --> 00:20:52,530
- I know but it rose even
as interest rates collapsed

527
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,428
in the first quarter, how did that happen?

528
00:20:54,428 --> 00:20:58,870
- Well we have a very,
very strong what we call

529
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:01,755
core deposit funding structure.

530
00:21:01,755 --> 00:21:04,857
We're like a really big community bank.

531
00:21:04,857 --> 00:21:08,080
We operate a regional bank structure.

532
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,720
We're in a lot of rural areas.

533
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,040
We're in metro urban areas as well,

534
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,960
but we have a lot of stable deposits.

535
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,340
They're not as price sensitive,

536
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,630
they're more focused on relationships.

537
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:19,798
A lot of small business clients

538
00:21:19,798 --> 00:21:24,798
and so our NIM pressure
is more a function of

539
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,363
what's happening in our local markets

540
00:21:28,363 --> 00:21:30,700
than it is in the national markets.

541
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,468
So when you hear a lot of
national discussion about

542
00:21:33,468 --> 00:21:36,624
changes in NIM, it doesn't
inherently affect us.

543
00:21:36,624 --> 00:21:39,820
Now sometimes if we do some external large

544
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,940
and negotiable instrument funding

545
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,443
that'll move our NIM around a little bit.

546
00:21:44,443 --> 00:21:48,420
But in this particular
quarter what we really saw was

547
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:51,000
that our funding was increasing

548
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,590
but our rate of return
on assets was increasing

549
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,228
at a faster rate.

550
00:21:55,228 --> 00:21:56,910
- You know one quick last question.

551
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:59,020
You're paying an advertising
agency a lot of money

552
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:03,010
to come up with a new brand
between SunTrust and BB&T

553
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,420
when you merge.

554
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,637
Can you give us some kind of a of a hint

555
00:22:06,637 --> 00:22:08,403
as to what that's shaping up to be?

556
00:22:08,403 --> 00:22:10,870
Because SunTrust and
BB&T could mosh together

557
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:13,399
like some kind of kids
drink if you're not careful.

558
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:14,817
- Yeah.

559
00:22:14,817 --> 00:22:17,420
Well you know Brian, the reason we decided

560
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:20,420
to pick a new name versus
using either one of the others

561
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:23,590
or some combination is because our merger

562
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:27,490
is about improving profitability,
which it does enormously.

563
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:29,730
But it's much more importantly
about leaning forward

564
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:32,832
about major investments and
innovation and technology.

565
00:22:32,832 --> 00:22:35,050
It's about really getting excited about

566
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:37,600
meeting the needs of the
clients in terms of technology

567
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,920
and trust, kind of that
blended relationship

568
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,659
between technology and the branches.

569
00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:44,460
And so we want a name that
kind of a points forward

570
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,160
that excites our clients,
excites our associates,

571
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,260
and excites the market in general to say

572
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:52,860
this is an institution
that is moving forward,

573
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,430
is energized and trying to
take care of the community

574
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:57,450
at large and the clients in particular,

575
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:59,690
and we think we can find such a name.

576
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:00,523
- Good luck.

577
00:23:00,523 --> 00:23:02,170
You're a bank, Kelley
King we do wish you luck.

578
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:03,790
Appreciate that, have a
good Easter, thank you.

579
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:04,623
- Thank you, you too.

580
00:23:04,623 --> 00:23:06,920
- All right, on deck,
the trade war comes home.

581
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,660
How China and Wisconsin are now in a fight

582
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,720
and it's over with some say
our Foxconn's broken promises.

583
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,363
But first, to the moon Zoom.

584
00:23:15,363 --> 00:23:18,531
Both stocks trading but
one is really taking off,

585
00:23:18,531 --> 00:23:21,660
but do we need to learn
from Lyft that one day

586
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,810
does not an investment make.

587
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:26,450
We dig into Zoom and
Pinterest a little more

588
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:27,423
when we're back.

00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,760
The design thinking, digital engineering,

633
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,731
security, block chain, and
we will be first to market!

634
00:25:43,731 --> 00:25:45,105
(audience applauding)

635
00:25:45,105 --> 00:25:46,240
Yes.

636
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,280
- When do we launch?

637
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,480
- Unfortunately in two or three...

638
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:53,523
Hours.

639
00:25:53,523 --> 00:25:54,356
(audience applauding)

640
00:25:54,356 --> 00:25:55,707
- [Man] Why the delay?

641
00:25:55,707 --> 00:25:57,270
- [Announcer] Cognizant is helping banks

642
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,120
use digital technologies at scale

643
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,157
to advance speed to market.

644
00:26:01,157 --> 00:26:04,167
(upbeat music)

645
00:26:04,167 --> 00:26:05,450
- All right, welcome back.

646
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:06,740
Pinterest and Zoom may be getting

647
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,150
all the headline love today

648
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:11,005
but they are not the only names
that you need to know about.

649
00:26:11,005 --> 00:26:12,900
Here are some of the
other movers at the hour.

650
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,810
Sketchers, a shoemakers
sinking after missing earnings

651
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:17,170
and sales estimates.

652
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:20,300
Second quarter profit guidance
was also below forecast.

653
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,660
That stock is down.

654
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,000
On the flip side Honeywell, it's up.

655
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,290
They posted strong results

656
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:27,344
and they also raised
their full year forecast.

657
00:26:27,344 --> 00:26:29,370
Companies saying it saw strong demand

658
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:31,250
for its aerospace products.

659
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:34,107
And Travelers is taking
a journey higher today,

660
00:26:34,107 --> 00:26:35,500
leading the DOW.

661
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,860
The insurance company
beating EPS estimates

662
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,280
but it did miss a bit on revenues.

663
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,570
Travelers though also
did raise its dividend

664
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:44,470
and that stock is higher.

665
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,150
All right now let's get to Contessa brewer

666
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:48,385
with a CNBC news update, Contessa.

667
00:26:48,385 --> 00:26:49,320
- Hi there Brian.

668
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,220
Here's what's happening right now.

669
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,270
Democrats vying for the party's
2020 Presidential nomination

670
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:55,930
including New York
senator Kirsten Gillibrand

671
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:58,060
are condemning Attorney
General William Barr

672
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,630
for acting like a defender
of President Trump.

673
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,690
She had some harsh words

674
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:03,903
about Barrs' news conference this morning.

675
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,050
- The Attorney General
of the United States

676
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:08,950
is supposed to represent the
people of the United States.

677
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:11,220
He's not supposed to
represent President Trump.

678
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,130
And by having this press conference today

679
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:17,286
that is misleading the American
people was not appropriate.

680
00:27:17,286 --> 00:27:19,810
- A French judicial police official

681
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:22,560
says investigators think
an electrical short-circuit

682
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,860
most likely caused Notre
Dame's Cathedral fire.

683
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,550
He says the investigators still don't have

684
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,950
the green light to work in the cathedral

685
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,540
because of safety concerns.

686
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:33,250
Rescue services use two
cranes to pull out a bus,

687
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,840
which crashed on
Portugal's Madeira Island.

688
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,260
Killed 29 German tourists
and injured 28 people.

689
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:42,710
The bus was lying on its side
was part of its roof torn off.

690
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,130
That's your CNBC news update this hour.

691
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,916
Brian, send it back to you.

692
00:27:45,916 --> 00:27:46,980
- All right Contessa, thank you very much.

693
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,120
Well a pair of Technology unicorns,

694
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,220
billion dollars of the
public market are surging

695
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,270
after their public debuts today.

696
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,230
Pinterest pricing above
the high end of the range

697
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:58,540
at $19 a share and opened up 25%.

698
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,940
That sounds good until you hear this.

699
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:03,615
Zoom video communications, the ticker ZM,

700
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:08,391
priced at $36 a share
but only opened up 80%.

701
00:28:08,391 --> 00:28:10,810
Lets those talk about both
and start with Pinterest.

702
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:13,370
CEO Ben Silbermann telling Squawk Alley

703
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:16,370
the company is more
about utility for people

704
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:18,830
to get things done and
less of a place to talk

705
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,630
or for friends or to follow celebrities.

706
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:23,960
In other words, we are not
a social media company.

707
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,010
For more let's bring in Doug
Clinton Managing Director

708
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:29,696
at Loop Ventures as well
as our own Leslie Picker.

709
00:28:29,696 --> 00:28:32,530
Amazing response to Pinterest.

710
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:34,130
Are you surprised?

711
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:35,650
A 25% pop.

712
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:37,902
Either the bankers
screwed up in pricing it

713
00:28:37,902 --> 00:28:39,916
or people really liked Pinterest.

714
00:28:39,916 --> 00:28:42,410
- People do like it and to your point,

715
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:43,790
it's a discovery platform.

716
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,170
It's really not a social network

717
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:47,872
although we think it will be
comped like a social network.

718
00:28:47,872 --> 00:28:50,400
So I think the good
thing about Pinterest is

719
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,470
it's a great business.

720
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:54,516
They have this unique data
asset where people tell

721
00:28:54,516 --> 00:28:57,280
Pinterest how they see
the world in pictures,

722
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,717
how they categorize the world.

723
00:28:58,717 --> 00:29:02,070
The problem is companies like
Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat,

724
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:04,606
the companies that will
be comped on Pinterest

725
00:29:04,606 --> 00:29:07,131
are trading six to eight
times next year's revenue.

726
00:29:07,131 --> 00:29:10,110
Pinterest at this valuation
is closer to 11 times.

727
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,870
So it feels like the market
is already pricing in

728
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:14,082
a lot of that great business.

729
00:29:14,082 --> 00:29:15,640
- I mean first off, I
think the term social media

730
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,770
is outdated and dumb.

731
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:17,960
I mean let's just be honest.

732
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,880
It's just media at this point.

733
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,225
That said, do you think
there was a strategic reason

734
00:29:22,225 --> 00:29:24,390
why the CEO of Pinterest kept saying

735
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:25,530
we're not social media,

736
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,480
because he didn't kind of want that stain.

737
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,620
- Yeah, I think social media
is a bad word right now.

738
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,720
I mean you look at what's happening

739
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,530
with Facebook and Twitter.
- It's two words John.

740
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:34,666
- Two bad words combined into one.

741
00:29:34,666 --> 00:29:37,270
I think you look at Facebook and Twitter

742
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,650
and sort of what's happened with them

743
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:40,290
and public sentiment around,

744
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:42,010
especially privacy on Facebook,

745
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,440
but also the the conversation
just politically.

746
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,775
The discourse is very
difficult on both platforms.

747
00:29:47,775 --> 00:29:50,510
Pinterest talks a lot in there S1 about

748
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:52,100
empowering their users.

749
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,480
I think that's a very different message

750
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,560
than what we're seeing
Facebook and Twitter do

751
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,240
with their users where you
have FOMO and depression.

752
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,160
- You know what's amazing Leslie Picker?

753
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,310
Besides you by the way, is
that if a stock falls 25%

754
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:07,143
everyone screams Wall Street
really screwed that up.

755
00:30:07,143 --> 00:30:11,740
If a stock rises 25%,
nobody's saying anything.

756
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:14,938
It's still obviously 25% mispriced.

757
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,871
You see where I'm going with this?

758
00:30:16,871 --> 00:30:19,690
- Yeah, it's tough to
price an IPO perfectly

759
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:21,489
and if it closed flat today

760
00:30:21,489 --> 00:30:23,780
people would complain about that too.

761
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,500
But in terms of Pinterest,

762
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,402
this company sold primary shares only

763
00:30:27,402 --> 00:30:30,444
which means that all of the
money raised from the IPO

764
00:30:30,444 --> 00:30:33,050
went back into the coffers of the company.

765
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:34,750
There were no selling shareholders

766
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,809
that were raising money
to fund their own pockets.

767
00:30:37,809 --> 00:30:41,700
So what that means essentially
is if you do see a 25% pop,

768
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,540
that is a loss of capital,
that is money left on the table

769
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,530
that Pinterest could have otherwise used

770
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:47,950
to reinvest in their business.

771
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:51,170
Now that said, it is important
to keep investors happy

772
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:52,003
with these IPOs.

773
00:30:52,003 --> 00:30:54,080
You want investors who are
kind of gonna stick around

774
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,450
for the long run through that
six month lock-up period,

775
00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:00,720
which expires in about 180 days.

776
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,300
You want people that can stick around

777
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,750
and the best way to make them happy

778
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,260
is to make the money Brian.

779
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,240
- Yeah, it certainly is.

780
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,830
All right let's move on now to Zoom Video

781
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,420
because if you thought
Pinterest was doing well

782
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,253
and by the way it is.

783
00:31:11,253 --> 00:31:13,550
Nobody's taking anything
away from 25% gains.

784
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:16,440
Zoom, new ticker ZM, soaring.

785
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,517
Up more than 75%.

786
00:31:18,517 --> 00:31:21,110
Let's bring in Deirdre
Bosa from San Francisco.

787
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:23,828
Deirdre, okay Zoom getting a lot of love,

788
00:31:23,828 --> 00:31:27,003
but it also faces a lot of competition.

789
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:31,720
- That's right Brian and
I think Zoom's performance

790
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,570
says as much about the company as it does

791
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:36,940
about all the other big
enterprise tech names out there

792
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,510
who haven't been able to capitalize on

793
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:40,190
this video conferencing software.

794
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,170
You've got a very crowded field here.

795
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:43,040
You've got Microsoft,

796
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,703
which has been pushing Skype for Business.

797
00:31:44,703 --> 00:31:48,270
Cisco's WebEx, which Eric
Yuan actually works for

798
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:50,690
and then Zoom seemingly
comes out of nowhere

799
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:53,100
and sort of takes this
field and is the leader

800
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,920
and known to be easier to use

801
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,270
and part of the reason for that is because

802
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:58,510
it started in the cloud.

803
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:01,490
Some of the other competitors
and big names in this space

804
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:05,640
started on antiquated
conference call or chat software

805
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,060
so that's been one of its big successes

806
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,884
and I think that also
speaks to the argument

807
00:32:08,884 --> 00:32:11,130
and some of its risk factors.

808
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:13,070
How could it continue to compete against

809
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:16,750
these very well capitalized
big tech name competitors.

810
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:19,610
Eric Yuan has built a company
that was just more simple

811
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:20,660
and easier to use.

812
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,500
That's when it strengthened.

813
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,250
You can understand how
it may be continuing

814
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,650
to use these strengths to
expand into different verticals

815
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:27,450
like telehealth and education.

816

- [Announcer] Paid spokesperson.

876
00:34:26,973 --> 00:34:30,310
- This is a legal alert for
users of Roundup Weed Killer.

877
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:32,120
Roundup Weed Killer has been designated

878
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,980
as a probable human carcinogen

879
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,630
by the World Health Organization

880
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:38,500
and in July 2018 a judge determined that

881
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:42,020
all federal law suits could
move forward against Monsanto,

882
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,930
the maker of Roundup Weed Killer,

883
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:46,270
over concerns that
those exposed to Roundup

884
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:48,930
are at risk for developing
non-hodgkin's lymphoma.

885
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:53,060
And in a landmark 289 million
dollar verdict in August 2018

886
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:56,080
a jury concluded that
Monsanto's Roundup Weed Killer

887
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,630
and Ranger Pro Herbicides contributed

888
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:01,730
to a school grounds keeper's
non-hodgkin's lymphoma.

889
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:04,030
Roundup Weed Killer is the
most commonly used weed killer

890
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:05,890
in American agriculture.

891

Are we gonna get a word in
edgewise here, my friend?

00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,709
- I want to survive.

923
00:36:08,709 --> 00:36:10,018
- You're in, you win.

924
00:36:10,018 --> 00:36:10,851
- Yes.

925
00:36:10,851 --> 00:36:11,810
- All right, first up
Senator Mitch McConnell

926
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:14,470
announcing a bill that will
bump the national minimum age

927
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:17,570
to buy tobacco from 18 to 21.

928
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:19,180
It's just a bill, not of law yet.

929
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:22,702
It would also apply to vaping
products and we should note,

930
00:36:22,702 --> 00:36:26,770
some states in America already
have a minimum age of 21

931
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:28,820
so this would be kind of a symbolic move

932
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,810
to four states to do it.

933
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:32,020
Frank Holland, it's
kind of your beat here.

934
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,490
What's the reaction, what do you think?

935
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:35,360
- Well listen, there's
also a similar House bill

936
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,040
called the Scott Act named after

937
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,020
outgoing FDA Chief Scott Gottlieb.

938
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:41,700
Here's the thing, a lot of
stats we can throw out here.

939
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,910
Here's just another one,
90% of current smokers

940
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,947
tried a cigarette by
the time they were 18.

941
00:36:45,947 --> 00:36:47,960
This is really a public health initiative

942
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,540
and I think it makes perfect sense.

943
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,580
There's 16 million Americans
with a smoking related disease

944
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,764
in America right now and it's a problem.

945
00:36:54,764 --> 00:36:56,550
- Let me play the cynic here.

946
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:59,502
This is the tobacco
industry trying to get out

947
00:36:59,502 --> 00:37:01,585
in front of any regulations
that are going to

948
00:37:01,585 --> 00:37:02,553
come their way.

949
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:05,471
Why now after Scott Gottlieb
had already gone after

950
00:37:05,471 --> 00:37:10,471
the vaping companies because
there was a 75% increase

951
00:37:11,345 --> 00:37:13,669
in the use of those by teens.

952
00:37:13,669 --> 00:37:15,830
Now all of a sudden we have legislation

953
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:17,980
and surprise, surprise,
the tobacco companies

954
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:20,287
are supporting said legislation to raise

955
00:37:20,287 --> 00:37:23,050
the minimum age to 21.

956
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:23,960
- It's amazing Bill, right?

957
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,533
After they have these pods for vaping

958
00:37:25,533 --> 00:37:27,280
that are basically candy flavored.

959
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,360
- Exactly, yes.

960
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,580
- And JUUL the maker of many of those

961
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:34,040
is actually in support of
21 years to buy tobacco,

962
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,950
but I mean the McConnell release did have

963
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:37,450
some disturbing things
in it including that

964
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:39,330
middle schoolers we're
starting to vape as well.

965
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:41,720
We hear so much about teens
and kids in high school

966
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,690
doing this and I totally
agree with the marketing.

967
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:45,890
It does seem like candy and
you don't necessarily realize

968
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:47,140
there's nicotine in it.

969
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,771
It is not good for you.

970
00:37:48,771 --> 00:37:50,000
- By the way, there's more nicotine in it

971
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,953
in many of these cases
than in regular cigarettes.

972
00:37:52,953 --> 00:37:55,440
- All right, so it's bout
time they go to 21 anyway.

973
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,688
They should have done that years ago.

974
00:37:56,688 --> 00:38:00,646
The drinking age is 21,
why not the smoking age?

975
00:38:00,646 --> 00:38:03,720
- Well I understand you but a
lot of states, a lot of towns,

976
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,700
they've already raised it,

977
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,060
so I just think it makes a lot of sense

978
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,660
and two things can be
right at the same time.

979
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,230
It might be good for tobacco's
business somehow, some way,

980
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,330
but it's also good for public health.

981
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,530
- [Bill] Of course.

982
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:13,363
- Look I'm gonna ask you this Kate

983
00:38:13,363 --> 00:38:15,260
because you are the youngest
one on this fine panel,

984
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,673
which is do you believe that raising the,

985
00:38:16,673 --> 00:38:19,310
and I'm not asking you to
reveal any personal details

986
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:21,150
about high school but do you believe

987
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:23,084
that raising the age of something

988
00:38:23,084 --> 00:38:26,027
does prevent people from doing it?

989
00:38:26,027 --> 00:38:28,347
- I think if there's a will there's a way.

990
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:30,331
I was an angel in high
school and I am still today,

991
00:38:30,331 --> 00:38:31,394
but I'm just saying.

992
00:38:31,394 --> 00:38:32,485
- [Bill] You still are.

993
00:38:32,485 --> 00:38:35,062
- But I think if kids want to
get their hands on something,

994
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:38,070
you know we can prevent it
by putting laws like this

995
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:39,990
in place but again, like I said,

996
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:41,130
when there's a will there's a way.

997
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:42,320
- Probably a kid named
Will selling JUUL pods

998
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,153
at the high school.

999
00:38:43,153 --> 00:38:45,170
All right, topic number two.

1000
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:46,040
Kind of related.

1001
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,460
Cannabis consolidation.

1002
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,490
Canadian weed giant Canopy Growth striking

1003
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:52,960
a 4.3 billion dollar deal
to buy Acreage Holding.

1004
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,070
That deal however will
take effect after cannabis

1005
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,860
has been legalized in the US.

1006
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:00,066
While legal cannabis sales
have been climbing this year

1007
00:39:00,066 --> 00:39:02,970
so far the black markets also been rising.

1008
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:04,830
What's the future Bill of this industry?

1009
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:06,510
- You know what I find
interesting about this deal,

1010
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,940
this is almost like a
futures contract for Canopy.

1011
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:11,470
What they're doing is locking
in a price for Acreage.

1012
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:12,740
- [Brian] It's an option.

1013
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:15,900
- But at the same time I wonder
why Acreage would do this

1014
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,930
deal if they're locking themselves into,

1015
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:22,605
it's a 43% premium over the
company's valuation right now,

1016
00:39:22,605 --> 00:39:26,000
but what's to say that they
couldn't see an even higher

1017
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,850
valuation after we do inevitably see--

1018
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:30,940
- So Bill Griffith you're saying
that this could be actually

1019
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:33,310
a sign of lack of optimism
by Acreage Holdings.

1020
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:34,510
- By Acreage Holdings, yes,

1021
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,790
but Canopy I think is
making a very smart plan.

1022
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:37,623
- Oh, that's what I was just gonna say.

1023
00:39:37,623 --> 00:39:38,860
Acreage is a multi-state operator.

1024
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,490
It's in about 20 states already.

1025
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:41,890
Obviously this is contingent on

1026
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:43,620
federal nationwide legalization,

1027
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:46,700
but really smart move for
Canopy and also Constellation,

1028
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,470
which I know you have your eye on but--

1029
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,035
- Yeah absolutely, great
move for Constellation.

1030
00:39:50,035 --> 00:39:52,330
Yeah, they have some
warrants where they can,

1031
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:55,306
similar option, they can decide
to buy more stake in Canopy

1032
00:39:55,306 --> 00:39:57,460
but a lot of people are talking
about the cannabis play.

1033
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,440
Me, I'm looking more
at the Acreage business

1034
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,320
and the people they have on it's board.

1035
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,630
They have Bill Weld a guy
who's running for President,

1036
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:04,870
former Governor of Massachusetts.

1037
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:07,110
They also have a former
Prime Minister of Canada.

1038
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:09,640
So I really feel like Canopy
maybe buying that influence,

1039
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,600
because that's this is
get down to business.

1040
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,760
Weed's a commodity.

1041
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,970
Everybody's gonna be able to grow it.

1042
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:17,070
- By the way, it's not
the weed of yesteryear.

1043
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:17,903
- So I've heard.

1044
00:40:17,903 --> 00:40:18,736
- I'm told.

1045
00:40:18,736 --> 00:40:21,620
All right up next, let's talk
more about recyclable shoes.

1046
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,590
- [Bill] She told me by the way.

1047
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:25,930
- [Kate] He told me, I
think he heard it from you.

1048
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:27,190
- [Brian] You might have.

1049
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:29,870
Adidas just released a new
running shoe, get this,

1050
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:31,970
made from 100% recyclable material.

1051
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:33,900
Once your shoes have fallen apart,

1052
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,900
I assume they will fall apart,

1053
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,190
you can return them to
Adidas where they recycle

1054
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:40,640
for the components to
make a new pair of kicks.

1055
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,643
Zion Williamson--

1056
00:40:41,643 --> 00:40:42,861
- [Bill] I was just gonna say.

1057
00:40:42,861 --> 00:40:44,100
- Should be there spokesperson.

1058
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,250
I think he's probably
already signed with Nike.

1059
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:49,120
What do you think, gimmick
Kate Rodgers, or real deal?

1060
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,740
- It sounds like Adidas
wants to get this right.

1061
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:53,050
I think it says they're
giving it to about 200 runners

1062
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,969
to test them out, they're not
releasing the mass market yet

1063
00:40:54,969 --> 00:40:56,090
because they want to make
sure that they really---

1064
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:57,190
- [Brian] How long do they last?

1065
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,410
- That they really get this right.

1066
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:00,380
Well whenever you're done,
you can hand them back

1067
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:02,444
over to Adidas and I think
more broadly consumers

1068
00:41:02,444 --> 00:41:04,220
do care more and more about this.

1069
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,740
We see more companies paying attention to

1070
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,461
being eco friendly,
marketing things in this way.

1071
00:41:07,461 --> 00:41:08,294
- [Brian] Do they care?

1072
00:41:08,294 --> 00:41:09,190
- I think they do care.

1073
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,260
- You know what they care about more?

1074
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,560
Not rolling their ankle
or having their knees hurt

1075
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,649
while they jog.

1076
00:41:13,649 --> 00:41:16,013
- Yeah of course, but now recycling

1077
00:41:16,013 --> 00:41:18,235
is becoming a big business right now.

1078
00:41:18,235 --> 00:41:22,366
That's pointing to that and as
we all know actor Jason Momoa

1079
00:41:22,366 --> 00:41:26,242
just shaved his beard
for the obvious reason

1080
00:41:26,242 --> 00:41:29,940
that he's promoting aluminum
as a recycling thing.

1081
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,440
- Stop the presses, we
gotta end this show.

1082
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,702
Khal Drogo has shaved, here's the thing.

1083
00:41:34,702 --> 00:41:37,712
Frank, don't come at this
as a business journalist.

1084
00:41:37,712 --> 00:41:39,563
You're a six foot five inch dude.

1085
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:42,420
I don't know if you run,
I'm not quite your height.

1086
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,240
Listen, we run, it hurts.

1087
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,073
- [Frank] Absolutely.

1088
00:41:45,073 --> 00:41:47,425
- The shoes got to work
first and foremost.

1089
00:41:47,425 --> 00:41:50,220
- Zion Williamson was
perfect, a perfect example

1090
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,670
that if the shoe can't
hold up it's a problem,

1091
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:54,010
but I'm gonna be the cynic this time.

1092
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:55,450
This is really differentiation.

1093
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:57,970
Adidas has been trying to
increase it's market share.

1094
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:00,700
A couple years ago they signed
a Kanye to a sneaker deal.

1095
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,120
He's not really running anywhere,

1096
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,749
but those sneakers sold like hot cakes.

1097
00:42:03,749 --> 00:42:04,582
- But those sneakers are so cool, yeah,

1098
00:42:04,582 --> 00:42:06,180
he doesn't need to run anywhere.

1099
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,430
- Hey, you ran that marathon?

1100
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:08,263
What's your shoe?

1101
00:42:08,263 --> 00:42:10,112
It's a gimmick, it's
the new Adidas gimmick.

1102
00:42:10,112 --> 00:42:10,945
- So like you said, recycle it.

1103
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,648
- Finally, we're moving on.

1104
00:42:12,648 --> 00:42:17,648
remember how much hype Samsung's
foldable phone generated?

1105
00:42:17,724 --> 00:42:19,730
It's got a $2000 price tag,

1106
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:21,410
but here's the problem some reviewer guys

1107
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:23,970
who got this phone early
reported that it broke.

1108
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:26,970
In fact our own Todd Haselton
CNBC found the screen

1109
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:29,400
was flickering after just two days.

1110
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,570
There's the video from
our own Todd Haselton.

1111
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:33,330
Samsung, a real problem

1112
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:34,670
or they just haven't figured it out yet?

1113
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:35,560
Bill?

1114
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,060
- I think it's a bigger problem right now.

1115
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:40,721
Novelty is a big sales
item for technology.

1116
00:42:40,721 --> 00:42:44,801
This was novel to have the folding phone

1117
00:42:44,801 --> 00:42:47,730
but I think they're getting
ahead of themselves now.

1118
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:50,240
They're rushing products to
market before they're ready

1119
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,644
and they cost too much now by the way.

1120
00:42:52,644 --> 00:42:55,703
$1980 for a foldable phone.

1121
00:42:55,703 --> 00:42:58,730
It's becoming too complicated
and too expensive.

1122
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:00,070
- Well call me old-fashioned,

1123
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:02,460
but I don't need my phone to fold in half.

1124
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,962
I need it to have a nice
camera, good reception,

1125
00:43:04,962 --> 00:43:07,570
and kind of look cool but
I don't care that much.

1126
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:09,040
I wouldn't buy this.

1127
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,619
I'm not who they're marketing to.

1128
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:11,452
- I'm gonna tell you though,

1129
00:43:11,452 --> 00:43:12,770
this is the battle of the sexes though.

1130
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:14,868
I will say this women and
men phone differently,

1131
00:43:14,868 --> 00:43:17,199
we keep our phone, we tend to keep it here

1132
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:19,520
or in our like jeans pocket.

1133
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,353
- Back pocket.

1134
00:43:20,353 --> 00:43:22,893
- Yeah, having a phone
that can flex a little bit

1135
00:43:22,893 --> 00:43:25,697
when you're a guy helps
out Frank, does it not?

1136
00:43:25,697 --> 00:43:28,490
- But the phone doesn't flex it, it folds.

1137
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:29,447
- Yeah, but you could put it here.

1138
00:43:29,447 --> 00:43:31,320
The point is you could put
it maybe in this pocket

1139
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,153
a little bit easier.

1140
00:43:32,153 --> 00:43:33,490
- I don't know about that part,

1141
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:35,120
but here's the thing I actually
talked to Todd about this

1142
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,040
a little bit deeper.

1143
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,390
He says that the resolution
on the screen isn't as good

1144
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:40,520
and the colors aren't as good
so if your whole selling point

1145
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,530
is that it's a bigger screen

1146
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:43,480
and the screen's not as
good as your other phone,

1147
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,520
you might be missing the mark.

1148
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,460
- Todd's the smart guy, I
don't know if he did this,

1149
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,618
but I do know Samsung claimed
that some of the reviewers

1150
00:43:47,618 --> 00:43:50,010
accidentally, there's a protective screen,

1151
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:51,403
they took it off thinking
it was removable.

1152
00:43:51,403 --> 00:43:52,236
- He didn't do that.

1153
00:43:52,236 --> 00:43:53,069
He did not do that.

1154
00:43:53,069 --> 00:43:54,110
- Okay, but apparently some people did

1155
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:55,585
but it's not a removable thing.

1156
00:43:55,585 --> 00:43:57,210
They peeled the screen off.

1157
00:43:57,210 --> 00:43:59,210
- He actually tweeted up close photos

1158
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:02,370
that he did not do that and his
screen still was flickering.

1159
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:04,912
- Bottom line Kate Rogers,
yes or no, $2000 dollar phone?

1160
00:44:04,912 --> 00:44:06,370
- No, not for me.

1161
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:07,560
But you you need to get it right.

1162
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:10,290
We talked about apples
wireless charging mat

1163
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:11,340
that they pulled from the market

1164
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:12,280
because they said it wasn't ready.

1165
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,071
This is a great example of
why it needs to be ready.

1166
00:44:14,071 --> 00:44:15,480
- I have a question.

1167
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,430
Where's the button?

1168
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:18,923
Kelly's got these, I press
a button and you and you

1169
00:44:18,923 --> 00:44:20,380
fall into the alligator pits.

1170
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:21,220
Where are those buttons?

1171
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:22,053
- And then I survive?

1172
00:44:22,053 --> 00:44:23,070
- You survived.

1173
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:25,018
- All I can say is I'm exhausted now.

1174
00:44:25,018 --> 00:44:26,976
- Come on WEX one morning.

1175
00:44:26,976 --> 00:44:29,170
Trending stories of Bill Griffith.

1176
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:30,003
- You bet I will.

1177
00:44:30,003 --> 00:44:31,690
- Okay, we'll see you
there in the morning Bill.

1178
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:34,140
Thank you all. (laughing)

1179

- What's going on?

1183
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:47,640
I've done all sorts of
research, read earnings reports,

1184
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,160
looked at chart patterns.

1185
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,504
I even built my own
historic trading model.

1186
00:44:50,504 --> 00:44:52,413
- And you still not sure if
you want to make the trade?

1187
00:44:52,413 --> 00:44:53,272
- Exactly.

1188
00:44:53,272 --> 00:44:55,345
- Sounds like a case
of analysis paralysis.

1189
00:44:55,345 --> 00:44:56,600
- Is there a cure?

1190
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,110
- TD Ameritrade trade desk.

00:46:15,947 --> 00:46:17,650

- How many previous owners?

1231
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:20,740
- Has it been in any accidents?

1232
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:21,860
- Is there room for twins?

1233

- Or triplets?

1234
00:46:22,893 --> 00:46:24,240
- [Announcer] We all know

1235
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,120
the most important question is always...

1236
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,470
- Am I getting a good deal?

Foxconn back in focus today

1249

Governor Tony Evers telling reporters

that he wants to renegotiate the deal

1251

saying the company will not
be creating the 13000 jobs

1252

that it pledged.

what appears to be falling
through the cracks here?

1262
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:23,160
- Well you know we're all
sort of waiting to see

1263
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,503
whether the Foxconn will come through on

1264
00:47:25,503 --> 00:47:27,611
what it has said it would do

1265
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:32,220
and I think it's fair
to say that the progress

1266
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:34,793
toward those goals has been slow.

1267
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:39,520
- How slow as in slow we're
getting there eventually

1268
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,810
or slow as in the car
is not actually moving

1269
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:43,133
down the highway?

1270
00:47:43,133 --> 00:47:47,290
- The car is moving, it might
be moving at I don't know,

1271
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:49,088
25 miles an hour or something.

1272
00:47:49,088 --> 00:47:54,088
They've made multiple changes
to their plans for plant.

1273
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:57,130
Initially they said it was
going to be what they call a

1274
00:47:57,130 --> 00:48:00,250
generation 10.5 flat screen plant,

1275
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:04,100
which is the largest most
expensive type of plant

1276
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,113
in this industry.

1277
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:09,430
Finally, middle of last
year they acknowledged no,

1278
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:11,590
we're not going to build
a generation 10 plant.

1279
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:13,800
It's going to be a generation six plant,

1280
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:17,734
smaller less costly and
then a month or two ago

1281
00:48:17,734 --> 00:48:20,670
it looked like they were
thinking about backing away

1282
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:24,489
from building a factory
at all in Wisconsin.

1283
00:48:24,489 --> 00:48:26,530
Then the President, Donald Trump,

1284
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:29,401
gets on the phone to Terry
Gou, Chairman of Foxconn.

1285
00:48:29,401 --> 00:48:32,310
All of a sudden within
hours Foxconn comes out

1286
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:34,210
with a statement saying yes we will build

1287
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:36,980
this smaller type of factory.

1288
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:41,130
Foxconn continues to maintain
it'll create 13000 jobs.

1289
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:43,977
A lot of people in Wisconsin just don't,

1290
00:48:43,977 --> 00:48:45,607
they're not buying it.

1291
00:48:45,607 --> 00:48:46,940
- I was gonna say listen Rick,

1292
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:48,940
do you believe and the
sources you talk to?

1293
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:51,801
Heck, do your neighbors
believe that this plant

1294
00:48:51,801 --> 00:48:54,433
will ever get built?

1295
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:02,321
- Personally yeah, I think
there's a good chance

1296
00:49:02,321 --> 00:49:04,610
that something is going to be built there.

1297
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:07,689
I mean they already are, they
have construction underway

1298
00:49:07,689 --> 00:49:12,440
so they've prepared a very
large like, I don't know.

1299
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:17,440
It might be 60 acre site that
has gravel compressed down

1300
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:21,457
tight to be the bed for the
foundation of the plant.

1301
00:49:21,457 --> 00:49:25,200
They let contracts about
two three weeks ago

1302
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:29,150
for like 34 million dollars
worth of preparatory work

1303
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:31,500
for the actual building construction

1304
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:36,250
and that part is under
way as far as I can tell

1305
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:39,425
and they say that this summer
they will start building

1306
00:49:39,425 --> 00:49:42,970
actual physical vertical
construction itself.

1307
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:44,500
- When they do that you, let us know,

1308
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,252
you take pictures, we'll
get you back on CNBC.

1309

1310

- Well just when you
thought that it was over,

1373
00:52:57,350 --> 00:52:59,430
the Sears drama is resurfacing.

1374
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:01,793
The company is now suing
former CEO Eddie Lampert

1375
00:53:01,793 --> 00:53:04,360
for allegedly stealing billions of dollars

1376
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:05,650
from the corporation.

1377
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:06,870
The lawsuit alleges that Lampert

1378
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:09,070
along with Sears biggest shareholders

1379
00:53:09,070 --> 00:53:11,936
unduly benefited from deals
that occurred under his watch.

1380
00:53:11,936 --> 00:53:14,423
The suit names other defendants as well.

1381
00:53:14,423 --> 00:53:17,202
Besides Lampert they include get this,

1382
00:53:17,202 --> 00:53:19,464
Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin

1383
00:53:19,464 --> 00:53:22,230
and Hedge Fund Manager Bruce Berkowitz.

1384
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:25,330
Sears Holdings filed for
bankruptcy this past October.

All right coming up,

1386

1388
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:32,917

1430

Call the insurance company.

1431
00:55:18,795 --> 00:55:19,797
- It's them calling us.

1432
00:55:19,797 --> 00:55:20,900
- It's gonna be a week

1433
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:21,755
before they can get
through on these roads.

1434
00:55:21,755 --> 00:55:22,588
- Shh!

1435
00:55:22,588 --> 00:55:23,421
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

1436
00:55:23,421 --> 00:55:25,090
- I said ask how soon they can be here.

1437
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:26,597
- Not you.

1438
00:55:26,597 --> 00:55:28,200
- Right now?

1439
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,470
- What's now?

1440
00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:31,615
- He says they're
surveying our property now.

1441
00:55:31,615 --> 00:55:33,210
- They're probably at the wrong house.

1442
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:35,075
- I don't see any hovering.

1443
00:55:35,075 --> 00:55:36,175
- His name's hovering?

1444
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:38,973

- Next time you think about buying a stock

1457
00:56:14,005 --> 00:56:15,480
you need to ask yourself a question.

Add this to your homework checklist.

Could Amazon come in and
destroy the company's margins?

A new op-ed ad on CNBC
highlights America's growing need

1464
00:56:33,901 --> 00:56:35,990
for financial education programs,

1465
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:39,220
especially for economically
disadvantaged children.

1466
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:41,988
It is part of our financial
education initiative called

Invest in You: Ready, Set, Grow.

And it's in partnership with
micro investing app Acorns

1469

and joining us now is
the author of that piece,

1470
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:52,550
Nan Morrison the President
and CEO the Council

1471

Also a member of our CNBC
Financial Wellness Council.

1473
00:56:56,900 --> 00:57:00,511
It's amazing Nan, you
can be in high school

1474
00:57:00,511 --> 00:57:03,896
and take classes on the Peloponnesian War

1475
00:57:03,896 --> 00:57:07,886
and not understand how
to balance a checkbook.

1476
00:57:07,886 --> 00:57:08,936
Why?

1477
00:57:08,936 --> 00:57:10,290
(laughs)

1478
00:57:10,290 --> 00:57:11,620
- That is quite amazing.

1479
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:12,470
- No offense to the Peloponnesian War.

1480
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:14,160
- Exactly, exactly.

1481
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:17,667
But we don't do a good job of
getting financial education

1482
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:21,100
into our nation's K through 12 schools

1483
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:23,820
and that's the mission of
our organization to do that,

1484
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:26,470
to teach those K through 12
kids about personal finance

1485
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:29,070
and economics so they can
make better decisions,

1486
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:31,100
so they know how to manage their money,

1487
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:32,290
to balance the checkbook,

1488
00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:34,696
to make decisions about
a credit card or a loan,

1489
00:57:34,696 --> 00:57:37,000
to make good decisions about those.

1490
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,360
- Now without getting into the
politics of school districts

1491
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:42,570
and unions but it's hard to get classes,

1492
00:57:42,570 --> 00:57:43,989
new classes created.

1493
00:57:43,989 --> 00:57:46,960
What's the best way to do that

1494
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,360
and what's been the holdup
for just saying hey,

1495
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:51,260
maybe you don't need
that 14th history class.

1496
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:53,445
Let's talk about how not to go bankrupt.

1497
00:57:53,445 --> 00:57:55,929
- One of the great things
about what we do is

1498
00:57:55,929 --> 00:57:59,360
we teachers and we help
them with the content,

1499
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:01,160
we give them lessons
and we also teach them

1500
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:03,520
how to integrate it into the everyday life

1501
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,700
of their classroom.

1502
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:07,470
So think of creating a mini
economy for little kids

1503
00:58:07,470 --> 00:58:09,210
in a K through five classroom.

1504
00:58:09,210 --> 00:58:11,510
Think about integrating it into math

1505
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:14,460
instead of those crazy problems
about the Amtrak trains.

1506
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:15,960
How many times have you thought about

1507
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:18,060
how fast that other
train is coming at you?

1508
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:20,600
No, but you think about what
your investments are doing.

1509
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:23,057
So we should be teaching
those examples in math

1510
00:58:23,057 --> 00:58:25,207
or another business oriented classes.

1511
00:58:25,207 --> 00:58:27,030
- And the weird thing about
this area in particular is

1512
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:29,010
you've got Wall Street,
literally Wall Street,

1513
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:30,160
I mean the physical street

1514
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,360
with the New York Stock Exchange on.

1515
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:32,193
- It's right there.

1516
00:58:32,193 --> 00:58:33,768
- Blocks away.

1517
00:58:33,768 --> 00:58:38,768
Our kids with nothing and no education.

1518
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:40,810
How do we bring those...

1519
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:42,080
They're physically this close,

1520
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,836
how do we make them work for each other?

1521
00:58:43,836 --> 00:58:44,840
Right?

1522
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:46,866
It benefits everybody
when everybody benefits.

1523
00:58:46,866 --> 00:58:48,220
- It does.

1524
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:49,900
Well, there are a couple
of things that we're doing.

1525
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:52,470
We're running Family Financial
Literacy nights at schools

1526
00:58:52,470 --> 00:58:54,876
where volunteers can come with
parents and teachers and kids

1527
00:58:54,876 --> 00:58:57,730
to learn about money and
we also have a new program,

1528
00:58:57,730 --> 00:59:00,280
Invest In Girls, which
not only helps girls

1529
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:03,263
to get introduced to the
language and grammar of finance

1530
00:59:03,263 --> 00:59:06,530
but also takes them to places.

1531
00:59:06,530 --> 00:59:08,906
So it introduces them
to the world of finance,

1532
00:59:08,906 --> 00:59:11,920
to people like you and me

1533
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,354
and some of the women here
at CNBC, the great ones.

1534
00:59:14,354 --> 00:59:16,370
So that they can see there's a possibility

1535
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:19,890
of a really interesting
career working in finance.

1536
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:23,119
- And you point out that
families of professionals,

1537
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:24,754
their kids have 30 million more words

1538
00:59:24,754 --> 00:59:26,960
than kids on welfare.

1539
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,620
A lot of those words
are financial related.

1540
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:31,680
Financial words can be scary
sometimes even to adults.

1541
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:32,513
Right?

1542
00:59:32,513 --> 00:59:34,414
How do we de-intimidize, is that a word?

1543
00:59:34,414 --> 00:59:35,247
(laughing)

1544
00:59:35,247 --> 00:59:36,210
- How about demystify?

1545
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:37,310
- Thank you very much.

1546
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:38,143
- Any time.

1547
00:59:38,143 --> 00:59:40,510
How do we demystify or
make finance less scary,

1548
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:41,343
how about that?

1549
00:59:41,343 --> 00:59:43,310
- Yeah, I think we just
need to talk about it more.

1550
00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:44,620
It's just like any language.

1551
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:46,980
Once you start speaking
it, learning the words,

1552
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:48,400
it's less scary and you don't need to know

1553
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,115
all the complicated stuff.

1554
00:59:50,115 --> 00:59:53,960
You just need to know like
hello, please, thank you,

1555
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:54,920
and where's the bathroom,

1556
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:57,200
and if we can teach the
kids the basic language

1557
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,928
and grammar of finance
when they're little,

1558
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:02,260
same as when we teach them
everything else, then it's easy.

1559
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:04,360
Then they're not afraid
to ask the question.

1560
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:07,021
- [Brian] Or make up words
during segments on vocabulary.

1561
01:00:07,021 --> 01:00:07,854
- [Nan] They can do that too.

1562
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:09,620
- Nan Morrison, great stuff.

1563
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:11,870
Important topic, thank you
very much for joining us.

1564
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:13,680
- Thanks so much for having me here.

1565
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:16,243
- Of course, I don't want
to de-intimidize you.

1566
01:00:16,243 --> 01:00:17,344
(laughing)
