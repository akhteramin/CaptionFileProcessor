(energetic music)

8
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,350
- Good morning and welcome
to Great Day Washington.

9
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,470
I'm Markette Sheppard.

10
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,840
Kristen is out today but if you're at home

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,970
and you're looking for a mate,

12
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:43,160
we've got some great digital dating tips

13
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,350
for you this morning.

14
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:46,870
Plus we're sharing how a
group of local scientists

15
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,520
are working hard to combat the pollution

16
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,230
in the Potomac which is so important

17
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,350
as we get that storm runoff this morning.

18
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,990
But first, let's get over
to WUSA9 meteorologist,

19
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:01,080
Howard Bernstein, for an update
on this flash flood warning

20
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,160
we're currently experiencing, Howard?

21
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,170
- Yeah, Markette, we've been tracking

22
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,210
some very heavy rainfall
over the last few hours.

23
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,130
It came out of Frederick
then moved right down to 70.

24
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,820
These are flood warnings from Frederick

25
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,790
in towards Southern
Prince George's County.

26
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,750
So much of the area under
active flash flood warnings

27
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,480
and these are the worst, most dangerous

28
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,560
type of flooding we can have,

29
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,480
because flash flooding
happens very quickly.

30
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,780
It could catch you by surprise

31
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,130
and it only takes a
foot, two feet of water,

32
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:25,910
to push your car off the road.

33
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,710
So that's why you hear
turn around, don't drown.

34
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:30,020
The good news is that up
in Frederick at least,

35
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,160
the heaviest rains are done,

36
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,140
but even Howard County now under

37
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,270
a flash flood warning 'til 11:45.

38
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,960
Montgomery County on the East Side,

39
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,700
seeing some heavier rains,
but the heaviest rains,

40
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,670
and Mary and I were looking at this,

41
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,090
some of the precip intensities,

42
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,730
the rainfall intensities
are in the five plus inches

43
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,280
per hour in the heaviest parts,

44
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,060
so these are tropical downpours

45
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,570
causing some flash flooding.

46
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:52,020
Not everywhere, but there've
been a number of water rescues

47
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,000
already in Frederick
and Montgomery Counties.

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,600
You see along I-66 and South
seems to be the heaviest.

49
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,480
Silver Spring, you're starting to see,

50
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,290
not quite as heavy rain move in

51
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,280
but everywhere you see orange and red,

52
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,140
very, very heavy rainfall for Fedex Field

53
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,720
right across the heart of D.C.

54
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,880
Now moving down toward Alexandria here,

55
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,330
just about to Franconia.

56
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:14,000
So our friends down in
Mount Vernon and Lowertown

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,190
and areas of Prince George's County

58
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,530
outside the Beltway there.

59
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,630
Just generally South of Joint Base Andrews

60
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,990
over toward Clinton and
Melwood and Upper Marlboro,

61
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,010
get ready as this whole mass of water

62
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,570
is moving down towards you

63
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:28,017
with that flash flood warning until 11:15,

64
00:02:28,017 --> 00:02:29,267
and Prince George's County,

65
00:02:29,267 --> 00:02:30,860
and we are gonna see better weather.

66
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,770
Once we get rid of this
stuff this morning,

67
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:35,610
we'll see the activity shift
off to the South and West

68
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,300
as we get into the afternoon.

69
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,110
So the next one to two hours

70
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,890
could be particularly bad with flooding

71
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,520
but it will get better
this afternoon, Ellen.

72
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,630
- I hope so 'cause the roads

73
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,610
are not looking good right now.

74
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,080
This is a live look at the Beltway.

75
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,170
We had a closure here.

76
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,580
They've just opened a second left lane

77
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,130
on the inner loop of the the Beltway

78
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,920
by the American Legion Bridge.

79
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,290
Let me show you some of the backups

80
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,230
because this has been
going on for a while.

81
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:01,100
It sounds like there was a
tree that fell onto a vehicle,

82
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,580
caused some sort of accident.

83
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,610
They're trying to move it over

84
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,410
to the right hand side
as quickly as possible

85
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,830
but you can see from that camera,

86
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:07,910
that's what traffic looks like,

87
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,860
trying to head around the
inner loop of the Beltway.

88
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,600
You're jammed coming from
the Springfield interchange.

89
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,570
This is my maps to show
you some of the delays.

90
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,890
I-270 southbound, not looking good.

91
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,220
The Beltway is not looking good,

92
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,541
and I'm also now seeing
reports in North Arlington

93
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,950
of several flooded
streets that we're having

94
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,930
some water rescues with.

95
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:28,000
We've had many rescues
up in Frederick as well,

96
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,500
following Frederick County,

97
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,640
their police department's Twitter page.

98
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,730
They've been just tweeting
out closures like crazy.

99
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,420
These are just the main streets,
not even the side streets.

100
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,920
Definitely impacting you
as you head out the door.

101
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,613
(upbeat music)

102
00:03:44,435 --> 00:03:47,562
(crowd cheering)

103
00:03:47,562 --> 00:03:49,062
- We got the gold!

104
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,550
All right, now to your top
headlines this morning.

105
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,960
The U.S. Women's Soccer Team,

106
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,820
they got quite the welcome last night

107
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,010
when they returned to
their hotel in France.

108
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,966
The U.S. captured its fourth
Women's World Cup title

109
00:03:59,966 --> 00:04:03,030
in a two to nothing win
over the Netherlands.

110
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,000
Captain Megan Rapinoe scored
the first goal of the match

111
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,500
and was named the tournament's
outstanding player.

112
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,310
New York City Mayor, Bill de Blasio,

113
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:13,090
he invited the players
to a ticker tape parade

114
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:17,000
in Manhattan's Canyon
of Heroes on Wednesday.

115
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,910
Developing this morning,

116
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,960
there was panic inside Union Station

117
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,880
after loud bangs were
mistaken for gunshots.

118
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,000
Police are now telling us it appears

119
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,660
that this was all just fireworks.

120
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,270
The incident happened shortly
before five last night,

121
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,600
and many people took to social
media to document the chaos.

122
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,630
One guys said he looked for exit signs

123
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,730
and walked out the back of a store

124
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,270
with some other customers.

125
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,510
Other people said they hid

126
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,563
in the storage closets and restrooms

127
00:04:41,563 --> 00:04:44,120
until they were given the all clear.

128
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,310
- It's crazy and we live in a society,

129
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:50,020
not only in America but
all across the world,

130
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,030
when we hear unexpected sounds,

131
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:56,900
it draws our attention to
what could possibly be,

132
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,810
and fortunately, unfortunately,

133
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,670
it's just the type of
times that we live in.

134
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,660
It scares people.

135
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,660
It scares people because you never know,

136
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,560
especially after 9/11.

137
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,247
You really never know what's gonna happen.

138
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,920
- Now the panic caused a stampede.

139
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,070
Three people were treated at
the scene for minor injuries.

140
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,430
When it comes to the person
who set off the fireworks,

141
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,260
police tell us they are investigating

142
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,840
but would not say if someone was arrested.

143
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,240
However, with all of those
cameras inside and outside,

144
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,840
it is likely at this point,

145
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,770
they know how this was carried
out and who is responsible.

146
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,280
Meanwhile, mistaking fireworks
for gunshots, this isn't new.

147
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,020
Just last week, fireworks
sparked a stampede

148
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,240
at Navy Pier in Chicago.

149
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,860
Police there say a
private security officer

150
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,825
mistook the sounds of gunfire, as gunfire,

151
00:05:42,825 --> 00:05:45,510
and shouted for everyone to take cover.

152
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,150
At least 13 people were
taken to the hospital

153
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,050
after being trampled.

154
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,570
Well, in a sweet story this morning,

155
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,260
some pictures of a little boy helping out

156
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,700
an Honor Guard member in Arlington, Texas,

157
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,870
they're going viral.

158
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,600
The police department posted the pictures

159
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,410
of 11 year old, Josh Brown,

160
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,420
tying Officer Wilson's shoe

161
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,350
at the 4th of July parade
that was held in the city.

162
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,280
Wilson noticed his shoe was untied

163
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,580
and his fellow officers
asked Josh to tie the shoe.

164
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,350
Josh said he was a little bit nervous,

165
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,030
but he got the job done.

166
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:17,040
The next day, Officer Wilson
thanked him for helping out.

167
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:21,690
Josh says he hopes to be a
police officer when he grows up.

168
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,610
Maryland voters will soon
have a new gender option

169
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,270
on voter registration forms.

170
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:29,050
Last week, the Board of
Elections agreed to list X

171
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:33,260
as a gender option along with
M for male and F for female.

172
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,580
The change mirrors a new Maryland
law for drivers' licenses

173
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,660
and state issued ID cards.

174
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,900
That law goes into effect on October 1st.

175
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,000
We also want to say a big congratulations

176
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,010
to the "Real Housewives of
Potomac" star, Ashley Darby.

177
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,800
She and her husband, Michael,

178
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,900
they welcomed a baby boy
into the world yesterday.

179
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,797
Ashley Darby posted on Instagram,

180
00:06:53,797 --> 00:06:57,730
"It was the most sensational
day of our shared life."

181
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:00,270
She's yet to reveal the baby boy's name

182
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,260
and we are all waiting for that.

183
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,500
Congratulations to them.

184
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,810
I was her Miss America roommate.

185
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:08,130
I never thought I'd get to
announce her first child on air.

186
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:08,963
That's great.

187
00:07:08,963 --> 00:07:10,470
Congratulations, Ashley.

188
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,110
Now we're gonna send
things out to Andi Hauser

189
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,870
who is braving the rain this
morning out in Alexandria.

190
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,853
How are you doing?

191
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,370
- Hey, good morning to you.

192
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,203
I'm doing well.

193
00:07:21,203 --> 00:07:22,970
I mean, I'm soaking wet.

194
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,640
Originally this morning,
we were gonna be out there.

195
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,460
We were talking about the Province

196
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,540
which is that old tall ship that's now,

197
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,870
it has the permanent home
here at Founder's Park,

198
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,100
but in light of things,

199
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,360
since there's so many warnings and watches

200
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,410
for flooding in the area,

201
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:36,840
we wanted to go ahead and show you

202
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,580
what things are like
right here in Alexandria

203
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,507
and as you can see,

204
00:07:40,507 --> 00:07:43,270
rain is certainly coming down.

205
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,510
It's coming down in buckets

206
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:47,420
and of course, there are
many streets in this area

207
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,390
that are prone to flooding,

208
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:53,380
especially when we were in
that flash flood situation.

209
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,387
So, already, you know, you can
tell there's nobody out here

210
00:07:56,387 --> 00:07:57,460
and for good reason.

211
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:01,280
People have gone ahead and
either found some shelter.

212
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,010
But again guys, it is
certainly coming down.

213
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,780
We could just see it before it got here.

214
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,050
Just that dark line,

215
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,440
and it just continued to
move closer and closer

216
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,655
over the last 30 minutes, which
is where we are right now.

217
00:08:11,655 --> 00:08:13,260
It seems like we are
right in the thick of it

218
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,420
here at Founder's Park
in Old Town Alexandria.

219
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,245
So, I'm gonna step in for a second,

220
00:08:18,245 --> 00:08:19,720
dry off a little bit,

221
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,406
try and get the drops off my hat.

222
00:08:21,406 --> 00:08:23,756
In the meantime, let's
send it back to the ladies

223
00:08:23,756 --> 00:08:25,530

Andi Lew, welcome to Great Day Washington.

281
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:00,326
- Thank you, Markette.

282
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,160
When I was researching when
dating apps first came about.

283
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,190
Four years, it took me to
research and write this book

284
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:09,290
and I found that from
this swipe left culture,

285
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:12,090
people really want meaningful connections

286
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:15,590
and so this is the ultimate
dating wellness book

287
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,870
because I'm a certified
wellness and lifestyle coach.

288
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,520
I want you to be able to find love.

289
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,600
- And people are happier and
healthier the research says,

290
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,160
when they do have a mate,

291
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,770
but how do you do it nowadays

292
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:28,220
when it seems like everything starts out

293
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,910
in a digital relationship?

294
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,360
You're not meeting people
face to face anymore.

295
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,290
- Well Markette, you know what?

296
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:34,400
It's just so handy.

297
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,230
I mean, given on a day like
today you want to be indoors

298
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,770
or you're a single mom and
you just can't get out.

299
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:42,680
We like to do everything
from our phone, so why not?

300
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,740
However, we need to be careful,

301
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,020
as to how we put ourselves on the market

302
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,710
in this singles market,

303
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,570
because there are some
things that you can do,

304
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:53,890
which I explain, to help you
have a meaningful connection

305
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,540
and something that is safe.

306
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,410
- Okay, and so to do the research,

307
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:00,920
you actually went
undercover for this book.

308
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,753
(laughing)

309
00:12:01,753 --> 00:12:02,790
What does that mean?

310
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,010
- Well most of the time, I
didn't tell them who I was,

311
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:07,000
and I wanted to experience dating life

312
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,670
as a newly divorced
sort of woman in her 40s

313
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,440
and how it's so hard to navigate

314
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,920
through this world of digital dating.

315
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,980
It's hard to keep up,

316
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,750
and I wanted to be able to help others.

317
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,167
But other times, I did say,

318
00:12:17,167 --> 00:12:19,510
"Listen, I'm just an author
and I'm researching."

319
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,607
And a lot of the people
would reply back and say,

320
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:23,047
"Oh, that's a really good line.

321
00:12:23,047 --> 00:12:24,100
"I'm gonna use that line."

322
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,210
I said, "No, I really am."

323
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:27,260
- [Markette] And so they still
wanted to go out with you?

324
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,930
So when you say them, you
mean you were dating men

325
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:32,426
and interacting with men for the book?

326
00:12:32,426 --> 00:12:33,420
- [Andi] Yes.

327
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,160
- But sometimes you told
them you were doing research

328
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,217
and sometimes you just,

329
00:12:37,217 --> 00:12:39,210
and what was the barometer?

330
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:41,520
If you were interested
maybe you didn't tell them?

331
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,437
- Well, what I did was I kinda said,

332
00:12:43,437 --> 00:12:44,777
"Look, this really is research.

333
00:12:44,777 --> 00:12:46,147
"Tell me about your experience

334
00:12:46,147 --> 00:12:47,567
"because I would love to write about it

335
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:48,530
"and help other people."

336
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:50,527
And they said, "Well, can
we go on a date first?

337
00:12:50,527 --> 00:12:51,840
"And then can I be in the book?"

338
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,277
And I said, "Honey, you already are.

339
00:12:53,277 --> 00:12:55,790
"I've been screenshotting everything."

340
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,410
- Wow, okay.

341
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,243
- So there's some great stories in there

342
00:12:58,243 --> 00:12:59,500
but I did cover up their identity

343
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,890
with a bit of a cowboy emoji
or something like that.

344
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:03,860
- Okay, so it's anonymous.

345
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,180
Now, nowadays, everybody
if they're interested,

346
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,418
they wanna like slide someone a DM.

347
00:13:08,418 --> 00:13:09,251
- Yeah.

348
00:13:09,251 --> 00:13:10,770
- And you say those days are done.

349
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:12,070
Can you explain?

350
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,480
- Well look, people are
going into direct messages

351
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,410
on Instagram as well as dating apps.

352
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:19,360
You don't need to court via a dating app.

353
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,570
It can be actually through
any sort of social media

354
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,850
and I wanted to explain
the correct netiquette,

355
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,740
if you like, on how to do that.

356
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,420
- Okay, internet etiquette?

357
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,500
- Yeah, that's right.

358
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,050
- Okay, so you're saying you don't need

359
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:33,380
to sign up on a proper
dating app to date anymore.

360
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,970
You can use any social media platform,

361
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,920
but you have some rules of engagement.

362
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,753
- Well, that's right.

363
00:13:38,753 --> 00:13:40,760
First of all, people are
getting others' attention

364
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,190
by going on, what I call, a liking spree.

365
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,520
So on Instagram, for example,

366
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,480
they'll like a couple
of the photos at the top

367
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,710
and then maybe scroll down
to sort of a month prior,

368
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,170
and then a bit of a follow.

369
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,280
And that kinda gets
your attention, I guess,

370
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,190
when it comes up in the
notifications in your newsfeed.

371
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:57,660
And if you like the look of the person,

372
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,887
then you might slide into their DMs,

373
00:13:58,887 --> 00:14:00,760
and then a conversation begins.

374
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,010
- Okay, so go on a,

375
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,430
so you, do you recommend this?

376
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:07,070
Go on a liking spree, do
a nice comment and follow,

377
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:08,920
and then it comes up,
like, this person's name

378
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,092
like 10 times and you're--
- Well, not 10 times Markette,

379
00:14:11,092 --> 00:14:12,711
'cause then you're gonna
look like a crazy person.

380
00:14:12,711 --> 00:14:15,010
- Right? That's why I'm asking
if you would recommend it.

381
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:16,444
- That's right.
- Okay.

382
00:14:16,444 --> 00:14:17,277
- So I'd probably recommend

383
00:14:17,277 --> 00:14:19,349
about two to three times and a follow.

384
00:14:19,349 --> 00:14:21,240
And then--
- You said spree.

385
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,970
So a spree is two to three likes.

386
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,860
- Yeah, a liking spree is two to three.

387
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,148
That's a healthy way,

388
00:14:26,148 --> 00:14:26,981
and you know what?

389
00:14:26,981 --> 00:14:27,980
It's healthy to flirt,

390
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,510
and to do it safely and
with the right netiquette,

391
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,300
if you like, is the best way.

392
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,140
- Okay, that's good.

393
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,550
So not all attempts at digital
dating go according to plan

394
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:39,790
as we know in real life
face to face dating.

395
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:43,290
So, how do you avoid the disasters?

396
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:45,970
Or you do, maybe you're
not a weirdo or a crazy,

397
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,660
but you come across as one

398
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,140
because you liked too many photos.

399
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,985
- That's why you need my book.

400
00:14:50,985 --> 00:14:51,818
- Right, right.

401
00:14:51,818 --> 00:14:52,892
- Because there is a chapter called,

402
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,140
"How to Weed Out the Weirdos."

403
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,370
Are they weird or are they
just socially awkward?

404
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,510
I mean, this didn't come
with a book of rules,

405
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:01,140
so I wrote one, and it's
important to know sort of

406
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,350
how you are coming across as you say,

407
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,040
and there are ways to
come across, you know,

408
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,652
really authentic and kind,

409
00:15:06,652 --> 00:15:07,970
and things like that,

410
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:11,150
and you can have a very, you know,

411
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,520
people are getting married out

412
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,770
of these sorts of dating apps.

413
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:15,440
So it's important to know

414
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,200
that if you present well,
then you'll attract well.

415
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,210
- Okay, you said a good tip before.

416
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,090
We have to go to break,
but I just wanna share.

417
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,890
You said if you see someone on
Instagram and you like them,

418
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,660
try to do, like, a Facetime
or a Skype right away.

419
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,494
- Good, yeah.

420
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:29,327
- To make sure,

421
00:15:29,327 --> 00:15:30,550
and then you have a book
launch event in town.

422
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,730
Can you tell folks about it?

423
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:32,563
- Yeah, that's right.

424
00:15:32,563 --> 00:15:34,837
So basically I'd love you
to follow me on Instagram,

425
00:15:34,837 --> 00:15:37,020
and you can see all the details.

426
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,540
Also, you do need to
bring it to a video call

427
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,153
because then you can see

428
00:15:41,153 --> 00:15:42,450
if they're a fake person or a real person,

429
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,510
but learn how to block
their number as well

430
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,200
when you do do a video call.

431
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,198
- All right. Thank you so much, Andi Lew.

432
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:49,286
The book is called,

433
00:15:49,286 --> 00:15:51,337

00:15:51,337 --> 00:15:54,080

Thank you.

- Hey, welcome back to
Great Day Washington.

515
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,930
This morning, we are coming to you live

516
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,640
from Old Town Harbor,

517
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,210
where the rain is coming down,
but I wanted to tell you,

518
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,020
earlier this week, we
had a chance to catch up

519
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,090
with the folks from the River,

520
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:52,270
Potomac Riverkeepers Foundation,

521
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,930
and when it comes to water quality

522
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:57,610
after a major weather event like this,

523
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:59,080
things are gonna be compromised,

524
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,550
so here's what you need to know.

525
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,383
Check it out.

526
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:03,950
- We have our annual report.
- Thank you.

527
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,490
- [Woman] If you'd like to grab one.

528
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:06,470
- [Andi] One by one,

529
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:09,670
volunteers signed up here
at the National Harbor.

530
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:11,600
- We just felt that it
was really important

531
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,214
that the public had an opportunity

532
00:19:13,214 --> 00:19:16,570
to know when the water was safe to go in.

533
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,150
- [Andi] To learn how they can help heal

534
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,280
the waters of the Potomac River.

535
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,956
- We are launching our
Virginia and Maryland

536
00:19:22,956 --> 00:19:26,470
Citizen Science Volunteer Water
Quality Monitoring Program,

537
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,600
Educating them about where sources

538
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,770
of bacteria are coming from,

539
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,235
how they get into the river,

540
00:19:31,235 --> 00:19:34,730
and the public health risks
where people go in the river

541
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:37,750
and don't know when it's safe
to go in the water or not.

542
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,610
- [Andi] Dean Naujoks

543
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,530
from the Potomac River Keeper Network

544
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:42,490
helped launch this program

545
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,850
because there was little
to no data recorded

546
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,350
on the bacteria found in the Potomac.

547
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,320
- [Dean] Rule of thumb
is one to three days

548
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,230
after a rain event,

549
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,650
usually you will have
high levels of bacteria.

550
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,540
- That bacteria comes
from backed up sewage

551
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,270
and storm drains that
spill into the river.

552
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:00,540
Is there a specific type of bacteria

553
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,440
that we're looking for?

554
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,273
- That's right.

555
00:20:02,273 --> 00:20:03,600
It's E. coli.

556
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,134
That's the main test we're using.

557
00:20:05,134 --> 00:20:06,820
The reason we use E. Coli

558
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:10,720
is it's somewhat correlated
with human health issues.

559
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,570
From what I understand,

560
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:14,610
that's why there is a swimming
ban in the D.C. waters.

561
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:17,090
- [Andi] Patrick Fletcher
is a volunteer scientist

562
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,180
with the Potomac Riverkeeper Network

563
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,930
and donates his time to help collect data.

564
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,730
He showed us the process.

565
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:27,080
- [Patrick] I'm gonna just
scoop this in like that,

566
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,039
fill it up.

567
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:32,060
Now we have a clean sample
of the Potomac right here.

568
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,690
- [Andi] They also test the turbidity

569
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,050
or clarity of the water and the pH levels.

570
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:39,910
We don't have to go far
to process the data.

571
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:43,620
The Sea Dog, a boat donated
to the Potomac Riverkeepers

572
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:47,340
serves as a live working
science lab right on the water.

573
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,840
- [Patrick] So if it's fluorescent,

574
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,010
it means that there, it's
positive for E. coli.

575
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,570
- [Andi] The Riverkeepers then compare

576
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:55,960
the numbers to a chart to determine

577
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,700
if the sample is a pass or a fail.

578
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,230
- [Patrick] In the D.C. region,

579
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:03,210
we're using a conservative cut off of 126,

580
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:05,200
so this would be a fail.

581
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,390
- All the data collected by the volunteers

582
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:09,399
can be downloaded to your phone

583
00:21:09,399 --> 00:21:11,710
by using the Swim Guide app.

584
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,620
The goal is to let us
know if the water is safe

585
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,200
for a variety of activities.

586
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,290
- We're gonna be uploading it here

587
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:19,180
every single week on Fridays,

588
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,420
so that when people are
going out on the weekends

589
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,500
during warm weather months,
September through October,

590
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,400
they know based on that
data that we took that day,

591
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,730
whether the water is safe or not to swim.

592
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:31,230
A swimmable Potomac River is the goal.

593
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:33,870
- [Andi] Currently,
there are 10 test sites

594
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:36,160
along the river, but Dean is optimistic

595
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,850
there will be more as the program grows.

596
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:41,680
His hope is that this program pushes out

597
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,970
the pollution problem in the Potomac.

598
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,800
- We're seeing important things happening,

599
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,120
like upgrades to sewage treatment plants.

600
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,840
- [Andi] After all, it's
about keeping the water clean

601
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,463
for generations to come.
- [Dean] I can honestly say

602
00:21:53,463 --> 00:21:54,800
that this river is gonna be cleaner

603
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,050
probably in 10 years
from now than it is now.

604
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,673
- All right, guys.

605
00:22:02,673 --> 00:22:03,506
If you want more information,

606
00:22:03,506 --> 00:22:06,360
you can log on to WUSA9.com

607
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,530
but again, I'm out here in
Alexandria this morning.

608
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:11,490
We're actually at Old Town Harbor.

609
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:12,930
You can really feel the dock moving.

610
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:15,000
It seems like the wind's
even picking up a little bit

611
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,841
but the rain, definitely coming down.

612
00:22:17,841 --> 00:22:19,800
So as you heard there in the story,

613
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,990
you're gonna wanna
allow three or four days

614
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:24,330
for the bacteria levels and E. coli levels

615
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:27,660
to possibly drop in the
river before going into it,

616
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,770
or utilizing it in any way.

617
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:32,120
Let's send it back to
the ladies in the studio.

618
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:36,140
- [Announcer] We're
going gaga for gazpacho

619
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,290
in the Great Day Kitchen.

620
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,280
Coming up, find out where you can get

621
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,857
the summer dish all month long.

622
00:22:41,857 --> 00:22:43,920
(energetic music)

623
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,850
- Flooding rains continue

624
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:46,880
across Washington and Point South now.

625
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,840
New flash flood warnings
for D.C. until 11:15,

626
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,510
that also goes with south
toward Prince George's County.

627
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,760
Some of the rainfall rates here,

628
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,580
three, four, five inches per hour.

629
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,710
We'll take a closer look at radar

630
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:57,830
and let you know what you can expect

631
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,370

00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:13,180
House Buyers of America.

639
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,343
Real estate made real easy.

640
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,730
- With Cox, you get
everything you wanna watch

641
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,410
in one place using the voice remote.

642
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:22,940
- Show me action.

643
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,483
- Even a ninny like me can figure it out.

644
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:28,340
With streaming apps, you miss live events,

645
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,890
and waste time searching for shows.

646
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:31,140
- Not this one, that one?

647
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,830
- It's clear that Cox is the better choice

648
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,760
just like it's clear
that the teleprompter guy

649
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,763
thinks I'm a booboohead
who steals parking spots.

650
00:23:39,705 --> 00:23:42,560
(upbeat music)

651
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,710
- [Announcer] Get live TV,
great apps and on demand

652
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:47,890
from Cox starting at $79.99 a month.

653
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:48,950
- Hi friends.

654
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:50,990
Do you know what I don't like?

655
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:52,090
Liars.

656
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:53,980
Insurance company liars.

657
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:56,760
Insurance company adjusters
who avoid your calls,

658
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,060
rarely call you back,

659
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:01,070
who stall, delay and
do everything they can

660
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:04,630
to frustrate you in connection
with your accident claim.

661
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:08,210
And then, they offer you
a ridiculously insulting

662
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:11,110
amount of money while telling
you the bills were too high,

663
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:13,190
that you didn't need
all of that treatment,

664
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,470
and that you really
weren't hurt that badly.

665
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,850
So what can you do?

666
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:19,100
The system is not set up, unfortunately,

667
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,500
in a way that allows you to do much.

668
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,580
You can't file a lawsuit and
push them, but a lawyer can.

669
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,330
I'm attorney Paul Samakow,

670
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:31,580
and the antics of the insurance
industry really piss me off.

671
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,270
So when I represent you,

672
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:36,770
if I don't get what I
want for you, lawsuit.

673
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:40,140
Call one of my five million
numbers if you've been injured.

674
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,320
An attorney will answer.

675
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,769
That's right, an attorney
will answer your call.

676
00:24:44,769 --> 00:24:47,269
(light music)

677
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,410
- Into the afternoon.

678
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:52,520
If you see high water and you don't know

679
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,517
if the road is there, assume it is not.

680
00:24:55,517 --> 00:24:56,350
It's just very dangerous.

681
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,183
Now, the future cast.

682
00:24:57,183 --> 00:24:59,510
I do wanna point out, I think
this is about 20 or 30 miles

683
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,130
too far North because it's got the rain

684
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:02,410
still in Montgomery County,

685
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:04,230
but we've seen the heaviest down here so,

686
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:06,660
assume this is just a
little bit too far North

687
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,810
but even at 11:30, we still
have some heavier rains,

688
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:11,670
potentially coming in
to the South Side of DC.

689
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:14,620
The nice thing is, the trend
shows the rain moving south

690
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:17,130
and then southwest as we
get into the afternoon.

691
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:18,370
So through the morning,

692
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:21,810
we still have a threat for
some heavy tropical downpours

693
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:22,810
but then in the afternoon,

694
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:24,760
we'll see some sun as we dry out

695
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,300
with highs staying in the 70s to low 80s.

696
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,740
Much more comfortable out there,

697
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,390
but a dangerous situation at the moment.

698
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,580
Scattered showers and storms this morning.

699
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,830
Some of them heavy, heavy rain,

700
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,630
so please watch out for the high water.

701
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:38,463
Mostly in the--

702
00:25:38,463 --> 00:25:40,460
- Then it must be good.
- Yeah, yeah.

703
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,640
Totally, yeah.
- Right.

704
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,990
- So it's about, like raw vegetables,

705
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:45,010
so basically it's like
a vegetable smoothie.

706
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,220
Gazpacho, the base of
it, is tomato usually,

707
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,720
traditionally in Spain,

708
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,760
but we're gonna play with that
to base on what's in season.

709
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,360
So right now, we're
gonna do green chickpea

710
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,020
and cucumber gazpacho is
what we're gonna make.

711
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,080
- Oh, this is nice.

712
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,190
This is really--
- Yes, it's super healthy.

713
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,497
Green chickpea?

714
00:25:58,497 --> 00:25:59,330
- It's not dairy free though so.

715
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:00,163
- Right.

716
00:26:00,163 --> 00:26:01,500
It's not dairy free but
yogurt is one of those foods

717
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,037
where they're on the health food list

718
00:26:03,037 --> 00:26:03,870
as something that--
- Exactly.

719
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:04,703
That you can eat.
- It's good for you.

720
00:26:04,703 --> 00:26:05,730
- It's full fat Greek yogurt.

721
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,100
It's not low fat which is the best.

722
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,120
- Full fat?
- Full fat.

723
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:08,953
- [Markette] Okay, there you go.

724
00:26:08,953 --> 00:26:10,660
- Don't go for the low cal stuff.

725
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,474
- These green chickpeas look amazing.

726
00:26:12,474 --> 00:26:13,726
- Yeah, so they're fresh green chickpeas.

727
00:26:13,726 --> 00:26:15,330
- They're one of my favorite foods,

728
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,370
but this is the type of summer soup

729
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:19,200
that they eat along the Mediterranean,

730
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,504
so that's Spain and--

731
00:26:20,504 --> 00:26:21,460
- Yeah, that, so it's the southern part

732
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,432
of the inner Lucia region,

733
00:26:23,432 --> 00:26:24,663
is like where gazpacho kinda started.

734
00:26:24,663 --> 00:26:25,496
- Okay.

735
00:26:25,496 --> 00:26:27,500
- So obviously, tomato is a base but,

736
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:31,080
I mean, we have the grilled
local peach, piquillo pepper.

737
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:31,913
- So this is another.
- Gazpacho.

738
00:26:31,913 --> 00:26:32,903
So you have four different,

739
00:26:32,903 --> 00:26:34,587
so it's a different gazpacho each week,

740
00:26:34,587 --> 00:26:37,066
and this one is made
from Virginia peaches.

741
00:26:37,066 --> 00:26:37,899
- So local Virginia peaches,

742
00:26:37,899 --> 00:26:40,490
grilled and then we puree
it with piquillo peppers.

743
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:42,210
- [Markette] That's
beautiful, what's this?

744
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,043
- [Matt] And then yellow tomato,

745
00:26:43,043 --> 00:26:44,040
and yellow watermelon gazpacho.

746
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,610
- [Markette] Yellow, I've
never seen a yellow watermelon.

747
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:48,330
Our camera is slowly panning there.

748
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:50,138
- [Matt] This is the
hybridized watermelon.

749
00:26:50,138 --> 00:26:50,990
It's super sweet, it's delicious.

750
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:52,330
- [Markette] Any different tastes or?

751
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:53,410
- [Matt] It's a little more
sweeter, I feel like it is.

752
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:54,462
- [Markette] Oh really?

753
00:26:54,462 --> 00:26:55,295
Oh.

754
00:26:55,295 --> 00:26:56,342
- [Matt] Yeah, and they kind
of, there's tomato in that,

755
00:26:56,342 --> 00:26:57,222
so it kind of balances out.

756
00:26:57,222 --> 00:26:58,055
- Okay, beautiful.
- There's acid.

757
00:26:58,055 --> 00:26:58,940
There's sweetness so it's nice.

758
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,773
- Okay.

759
00:26:59,773 --> 00:27:01,098
Let's get back to this one.
- So let's dig in.

760
00:27:01,098 --> 00:27:02,720
So you got, we got the
red, we got the yellow,

761
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,956
now we're making the green.

762
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:04,920
- And the green, exactly.
- Gazpacho, okay.

763
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,763
I wanna go every week,

764
00:27:05,763 --> 00:27:07,550
just to say I had a healthy meal

765
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,030
at least once a week, Chef Matt.

766
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,100
- All right, so high protein.

767
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,300
You got the avocados.

768
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,750
- Okay.
- All right.

769
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,183
Lemon juice, lemon zest.

770
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,430
- Nice little twang there.
- Little bit of sherry vinegar

771
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:19,260
for a little more acid, which is so good.

772
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,100
All right, so what
binds it is the avocado,

773
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,020
the cheese, and the yogurt.

774
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,325
So you don't have to
put any bread into it.

775
00:27:23,325 --> 00:27:24,644
- That's nice.
- So it will not,

776
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:25,480
it will not separate.

777
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,560
And there's no crazy food
chemicals in it as well.

778
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,317
- [Markette] Oh, that's so great.

779
00:27:29,317 --> 00:27:32,200
And then the bread helps you
stay slim and trim and light

780
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,676
in summer as well.
- Exactly.

781
00:27:33,676 --> 00:27:34,820
- [Markette] But full
because of the chickpeas.

782
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,653
- [Matt] Exactly.

783
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:36,640
So jalapenos, because everybody

784
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,620
likes spicy food in the summertime.

785
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:42,280
Fresh mint, and obviously
a lot of green herbs

786
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,117
to make it green, and then basil.

787
00:27:44,117 --> 00:27:46,430
And then water to thin it out,

788
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,850
to get whatever consistency you want.

789
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:49,530
You can add more or less water.

790
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:53,070
So fresh still water 'cause
it won't effect the flavor.

791
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:53,903
It's nice and neutral.

792
00:27:53,903 --> 00:27:56,390
There's no chlorine or any
chemicals or whatever in it.

793
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:57,223
- [Markette] Ah, okay.

794
00:27:57,223 --> 00:27:58,631
So that's why you use that.

795
00:27:58,631 --> 00:28:00,370
- [Matt] Yes, it won't
affect the flavor at all.

796
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:01,920
- [Markette] So we're
stirring this up on TV,

797
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,990
but at home if you were to
attempt this, what would you use?

798
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:04,823
- [Matt] So at home,

799
00:28:04,823 --> 00:28:06,690
you would use a blender,
obviously to puree it,

800
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:08,750
and then if you want it chunky or smooth,

801
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,970
you can pass it through
a china cap or a chinois

802
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:13,120
to get it whatever texture
you want, but it's open ended.

803
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,007
You can eat it like this
if you want. (laughs)

804
00:28:16,007 --> 00:28:16,853
- [Markette] Uh, okay no thank you.

805
00:28:16,853 --> 00:28:19,486
I'll just keep stirring
this and as you continue.

806
00:28:19,486 --> 00:28:20,319
(laughing)

807
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:22,100
Okay, so imagine.
- It's like yogurt soup.

808
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,150
- [Markette] Imagine you have a blender

809
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:24,870
and all of these ingredients,

810
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,920
get nice and smooth with no lumps,

811
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,640
like you chefs do so well.

812
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,764
How would it look when
you finally plate it?

813
00:28:30,764 --> 00:28:31,706
- [Matt] So, we're gonna plate it.

814
00:28:31,706 --> 00:28:32,810
This is how we do at the restaurant.

815
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:36,523
A little bit of tzatziki, so
dill, cucumber, Greek yogurt,

816
00:28:38,515 --> 00:28:41,230
and if you want, you can
do the rest gluten-free.

817
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,230
I like a little breadcrumbs for texture.

818
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:44,270
- Just a little.
- Just a little bit.

819
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:46,112
- [Markette] And it's also
very beautiful on the plate.

820
00:28:46,112 --> 00:28:47,730
- [Matt] All right, a lot of olive oil,

821
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:48,563
'cause they're Mediterranean,

822
00:28:48,563 --> 00:28:52,020
they love olive oil and olives,
and then pour tableside.

823
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,030
Nice and smooth, see that
little texture to it.

824
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:54,863
- [Markette] Oh, so that's nice.

825
00:28:54,863 --> 00:28:56,170
So the waiter comes out and pours it?

826
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:57,010
- [Matt] Yeah, we pour it tableside.

827
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:59,939
- [Markette] At your seat,
I love when they do that.

828
00:28:59,939 --> 00:29:01,023
- [Matt] And I'll put
some more olive oil on,

829
00:29:01,023 --> 00:29:02,064
'cause olive oil is really good.

830
00:29:02,064 --> 00:29:02,897
(Markette laughs)

831
00:29:02,897 --> 00:29:03,730
And that's it.

832
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:04,970
- [Markette] All right, that's beautiful.

833
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:06,300
Now, I would probably do this.

834
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,410
I love breadcrumbs, could you do that?

835
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:09,611
- [Matt] Yeah, you can
do whatever you want.

836
00:29:09,611 --> 00:29:10,816
- Just like a little.
- Yeah.

837
00:29:10,816 --> 00:29:11,766
(Markette humming)

838
00:29:11,766 --> 00:29:12,770
- And then like a little?
- Little bit of microgreens.

839
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:13,670
- [Markette] Yeah exactly,

840
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,440
'cause then I can say
that I ate my vegetables,

841
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,010
and no one knows it's a tablespoon full.

842
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:19,980
Now what's great about Olivia,

843
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:23,940
is you have this torta de
gazpacho or gazpacho de torta,

844
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,242
depending on which order you eat it.

845
00:29:26,242 --> 00:29:29,420
So if the soup is just not
enough, you have something more.

846
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,660
- Yeah, so it's similar to a combo plate.

847
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,920
For 16 bucks you can come in,

848
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,076
and get whatever weekly gazpacho we have,

849
00:29:34,076 --> 00:29:37,950
little village salad, and
a little burrata sandwich.

850
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:38,783
- That looks so amazing.

851
00:29:38,783 --> 00:29:40,540
- Little bit of pan-cooked
tomate on the bottom.

852
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,170
- Wow, so the burrata's
like nice and soft,

853
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:43,710
and then you squeeze it and then.

854
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:46,270
- Yeah, it just oozes out.
- It just oozes out all over.

855
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:48,100
Can y'all see that at home?

856
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,610
Okay, I'm gonna leave it here,
but look at that burrata.

857
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:52,117
And then you squeeze it
when you bite into it,

858
00:29:52,117 --> 00:29:56,290
and you're like, it's the best
meal I ever had in my life!

859
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:58,550
Okay, so four different gazpachos.

860
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:01,890
One each week, where do
we find you for more?

861
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:03,910

862
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:06,490

Chinatown, where Penn Quarter is.

- Are we live?

00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:55,541
- We are live on TV right now.

00:33:55,541 --> 00:33:56,840
- Oh, wonderful.
- I know.

You didn't know, we came quickly.

00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,430
There was no teleprompter for me to read,

945
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:04,320
but we are here to talk
about home ownership,

946
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,230
and how leasing an HVAC system
is so convenient and easy.

947

Tell me more.

948
00:34:09,063 --> 00:34:13,100
- Well, traditionally everybody
normally has HVAC systems

949
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,940
in their home and they
buy them when they go bad.

950
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,150
We have a new product,

951
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:19,730
and it's called a Lease
Hassle-Free Lease Program,

952
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:23,780
and with that it means that
you don't own your HVAC system.

953
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:26,303
Why own an asset that's gonna fail

954
00:34:26,303 --> 00:34:29,900
and it's gonna die over a period time?

955
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,060
Why own a problem?

956
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,800
Why own a maintenance issue?

957
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,690
Lease it.

958
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:35,400
- And a lot of people don't know

959
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,060
that they can lease their system.

960
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:39,534
This is like you said, hassle-free.

961
00:34:39,534 --> 00:34:41,774
Tell me more about what
makes it hassle-free.

962
00:34:41,774 --> 00:34:42,607
- What makes it hassle-free

963
00:34:42,607 --> 00:34:44,972
is the fact that you don't
have to think about it.

964
00:34:44,972 --> 00:34:46,790
We take care of all the maintenance.

965
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:49,410
We take care of the filter changes.

966
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:52,260
We take care of tuning
it up before the seasons.

967
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,970
We take care of any repairs.

968
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:56,300
Listen, the truth is,
everything's gonna fail.

969
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,530
These systems are gonna fail.

970
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:01,110
Everything in life fails,
and when they do fail,

971
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:02,170
we'll take care of it.

972
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:04,490
I mean, that's the thing,
and it's not gonna hurt you.

973
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:06,250
You're not gonna feel
the pain of thinking,

974
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:08,090
oh my god, what's this gonna cost?

975
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,980
It's covered, it's taken care of.

976
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:12,360
- That's true, because no one
wants to spend their money,

977
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,410
although you need it,

978
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:16,750
no one wants to spend their
money buying a new HVAC system.

979
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:19,110
How much can people
really save by leasing,

980
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:22,120
especially when you think
about your five to seven years

981
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,700
on a system, it's working
hard in the summer.

982
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,960
- Oh yeah, well you know what?

983
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,660
Actually I'll tell you a very quick story.

984
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,770
I was talking to an elderly lady,

985
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:31,800
and I was thinking about her,

986
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,340
and I was thinking she was on the fence

987
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,640
whether to lease or to
buy, and I said, "Listen."

988
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,767
I said, "I want you to
lease and I'll tell you why,

989
00:35:38,767 --> 00:35:41,037
"because if I lease it to you,

990
00:35:41,037 --> 00:35:42,517
"I know that you're gonna be covered

991
00:35:42,517 --> 00:35:43,747
"for the rest of your life,

992
00:35:43,747 --> 00:35:45,107
"that no one's gonna
take advantage of you,

993
00:35:45,107 --> 00:35:46,977
"that we're always gonna
take care of your system,

994
00:35:46,977 --> 00:35:48,872
"that no person's gonna come in

995
00:35:48,872 --> 00:35:53,400
"and not do you right with the repairs."

996
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,900
And when you lease it,

997
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,270
you know you're covered, and
that's what you're gonna get.

998
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:58,720
You're gonna get security,

999
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,750
you're gonna get the knowing

1000
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:01,960
that you don't have to think about it.

1001
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,793
You're gonna get the fact

1002
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:04,660
that you don't have to
schedule maintenances,

1003
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,257
we do that, you know?

1004
00:36:06,257 --> 00:36:09,010
- When you talk about
someone on a fixed income,

1005
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:10,580
like a senior citizen,

1006
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,850
who maybe doesn't have the wherewithal

1007
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:14,810
to go out and actually
shop for an HVAC system,

1008
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:17,610
you also offer a convenient monthly price,

1009
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:19,260
so people know what to expect,

1010
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,390
and know you're gonna be there for them,

1011
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:22,700
but then they also know what
to expect from month to month.

1012
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,533
- Absolutely.

1013
00:36:23,533 --> 00:36:25,350
The thing is, when you buy a system,

1014
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,960
and if you were to buy that, right?

1015
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,300
You think about, you're gonna buy it,

1016
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,590
but what you don't think
about is all the repairs

1017
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:33,210
and the maintenance over
the life of the unit.

1018
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:35,213
If you were to take the
repairs and the maintenances,

1019
00:36:35,213 --> 00:36:37,826
plus the cost of equipment,
that's a monthly cost,

1020
00:36:37,826 --> 00:36:41,380
because those systems are only
gonna last 10 or 15 years.

1021
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,520
So, we're just taking that,

1022
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,386
and just combining into one fixed payment

1023
00:36:45,386 --> 00:36:48,430
where you're guaranteed you're
not gonna have surprises.

1024
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:50,520
- I love this, especially
for new homeowners.

1025
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,770
You think about the elderly people,

1026
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:53,560
but then first time homebuyers,

1027
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,680
they can be overwhelmed with everything

1028
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,950
they have to do for a new home.

1029
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,470
So it makes sense,

1030
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:00,846
now but what happens
when you sell your home,

1031
00:37:00,846 --> 00:37:04,050
and you're thinking, oh my
goodness, I leased this HVAC.

1032
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:05,350
How can I transfer it?

1033
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:07,180
Can I transfer it at all?

1034
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:09,750
- Great question and the answer
is yes, you can transfer it,

1035
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,050
and I think honestly,

1036
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:13,810
any new homeowner that buys
your home is gonna be thankful

1037
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:15,710
that they're just gonna go into a system

1038
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:16,830
that they don't have to worry about,

1039
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:18,890
because lots of people who buy homes,

1040
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:20,020
sometimes it's their first home,

1041
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,090
and they're not sure what to do.

1042
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:24,350
With this, they don't have to do nothing.

1043
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:25,230
- I love it, I love it.

1044
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:27,710
I know that was definitely me
when I bought my first home.

1045
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:29,990
All I wanted to do was turn the lights on,

1046
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:31,630
have it be cool in the summer,

1047
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:34,160
and hot in the winter, or at least warm.

1048
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,540
Okay, so we got that covered.

1049
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,060
Now do you have any type of specials

1050
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,020
for our Great Day viewers?

1051
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:41,020
Maybe you're interested and
you need a little push at home,

1052
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:44,040
so we got the owner of Michael
and Son here, and I'm saying,

1053
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,460
what do you have for
our homeowners watching?

1054
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,293
- Well, I'll tell you this.

1055
00:37:47,293 --> 00:37:49,170
I don't want to sound too infomercially,

1056
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:52,970
but I will say that I want you
guys to really get into this.

1057
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:55,270
I want you to enjoy your summer,

1058
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:58,950
and if you guys honestly,
call us and call us now,

1059
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:00,620
we're gonna give you three,

1060
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,740
the first three months
of payments are on me.

1061
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:03,850
- I love that, I love it.

1062
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:04,740
So the first three,

1063
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,640
you don't even have to
talk to Basim himself,

1064
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,800
just call, get the first
person who answers and says,

1065
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,220
I saw Basim on Great Day and
you get the first three months.

1066
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,053
- Yes.

1067
00:38:14,053 --> 00:38:15,750
- I'm repeating this now,
so people will call me,

1068
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,530
you get the first three months on you.

1069
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:19,610
- Absolutely, and if you
want, you can call me.

1070
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:21,432
This is my personal
cellphone number right here.

1071
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:22,707
No, it's not here.

1072
00:38:22,707 --> 00:38:23,540
I'm just joking.

1073
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,373
- Okay, 866.

1074
00:38:24,373 --> 00:38:26,180
Okay, okay, but that's your number,

1075
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:28,580
and I just so appreciate
you making it easy,

1076
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:31,260
because no one really knows an HVAC system

1077
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,630
unless you're an HVAC
expert, and that's you.

1078
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:35,230
So I appreciate you coming here today.

1079
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,117
- I appreciate you having me.

1080
00:38:36,117 --> 00:38:38,939
- And you did great
for live unexpected TV.

1081
00:38:38,939 --> 00:38:40,187
(laughing)

1082
00:38:40,187 --> 00:38:41,790
You did great.

1083
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:42,623
- Thank you.

1084
00:38:42,623 --> 00:38:46,790
- Yeah okay, so remember for
the deal, you have to call,

1085
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:49,840
so remember call about Michael
and Son's leasing options

1086
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,530
and they're standing by to
take your calls right now.

1087
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:57,300
That number is 866-214-8608,

1088
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:01,420
or you can visit them
online at MichaelandSon.com,

1089
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,070
now let's send it over to Howard

1090
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:04,970
for an update on the weather.

1091
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:05,860
- Yeah, you know Markette,

1092
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,579
these batteries only last so long.

1093
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:08,860
They're been on since 4:15 this morning,

1094
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,820
but we're continuing to track the storms.

1095
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:13,440
Heaviest stuff now is
pushing from D.C. south,

1096
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,710
although we're not done with the rain,

1097
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:17,500
but I think the heaviest
rains if you are north of D.C.

1098
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,870
you probably have the
worst you're gonna see,

1099
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:21,260
and there's plenty of
flooding going on right now.

1100
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,760
Ellen's got some incredible pictures

1101
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,850
she's gonna share in just a moment,

1102
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:26,320
but on the doppler
you'll notice D.C. south

1103
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,560
we're seeing the heaviest stuff.

1104
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,340
Flood warnings now go into
Prince George's County

1105
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:33,150
'til one o'clock in advance
of this mass of water

1106
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:35,440
that is coming out of
the Alexandria, Clinton,

1107
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,350
Upper Marlboro, the Southern
part of the District,

1108
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:39,570
over toward even Northern Anne Arundel,

1109
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:41,800
Northern Calvert and Southern
Anne Arundel Counties.

1110
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,370
You see D.C. now, we're out of
the heaviest, heaviest stuff,

1111
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:46,350
at least in the heart of downtown.

1112
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:48,230
Alexandria down toward Mount Vernon,

1113
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:50,323
Accokeek still getting pounded there

1114
00:39:50,323 --> 00:39:53,220
with just lighter, more
regular rains if you will,

1115
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:56,600
back toward Georgetown, Northwest
D.C., Bethesda, Potomac.

1116
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,100
West Springfield to Mount Vernon

1117
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,690
as we said to Piscataway
in Prince George's County.

1118
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,270
And the heavy rains have
made it to Brandywine,

1119
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:04,350
it's gonna get a little bit heavier.

1120
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:06,910
Waldorf, it'll be there in
the next 10 or 15 minutes,

1121
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:10,010
and we'll give it another
10 or 15 minutes after that.

1122
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:11,567
As this whole area's moving southeast

1123
00:40:11,567 --> 00:40:14,100
at about 25 miles a hour or so.

1124
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,910
Charles County, eventually into Calvert

1125
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:16,860
and St. Mary's as well,

1126
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,630
and let's not forget west of the river.

1127
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:21,540
Our friends in Prince William
not seeing it nearly as badly,

1128
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:23,700
and I think that'll be
the same case in Stafford.

1129
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,840
Some of these rain totals by the way,

1130
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:29,290
that's close to five inches
in the last 12 hours.

1131
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:31,530
These are 12 hour rain
totals in Frederick,

1132
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:33,810
I saw a picture out of
Baker Park underwater.

1133
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:35,860
We saw some areas north of Martinsburg,

1134
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,990
five and a half inches
of rain since last night.

1135
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:39,910
Adamstown had about four and a half,

1136
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:41,780
four and three quarters since last night.

1137
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:45,510
So we've had widespread
flooding, please be careful,

1138
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:48,040
take all of these closed
roads very seriously.

1139
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,630
What are we looking at
for the next 12 hours?

1140
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:51,510
Well, still a chance for some rain

1141
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:54,020
and showers I think
through early afternoon,

1142
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,970
slip south and west, we dry out.

1143
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:56,870
We see a little sun,

1144
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:59,018
but a cooler day than we've seen in awhile

1145
00:40:59,018 --> 00:41:01,440
with highs in the lower 80s.

1146
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,420
Ellen Brian, unbelievable.
- Howard.

1147
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,850
- [Howard] You showed me
that map of the Beltway,

1148
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:06,380
it's almost completely red.

1149
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,213
- [Ellen] Oh yes, yeah.

1150
00:41:07,213 --> 00:41:08,727
I can go to that first
here, let's show you that.

1151
00:41:08,727 --> 00:41:12,390
The I-270 Southbound, the
Beltway, inner and outer loops,

1152
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:14,170
especially over by the
American Legion Bridge,

1153
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:15,960
because that is where we're seeing

1154
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,810
that first traffic lane camera
that I'm showing you now.

1155
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:19,890
We had a closure here.

1156
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:21,050
No longer a closure,

1157
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:24,440
but take a look at traffic
that is following that.

1158
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,410
We had a tree that fell down
on a car, caused an accident,

1159
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:28,910
so we're seeing these significant delays.

1160
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:30,480
Plus the rain's delaying people.

1161
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,930
Flooding on so many roads.

1162
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:35,170
This is right here, Lee Highway
at North Kirkwood Street.

1163
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:37,050
If you can look closely through,

1164
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:39,060
I know the raindrops on that camera lens,

1165
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:41,830
there are cars that have been
trapped in high water there.

1166
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:43,780
We've also been getting
people on social media

1167
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:45,280
sending us so many things,

1168
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,560
including some flooding in Metro as well,

1169
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,500
and the entrance that has
been blocked to the C&O Canal,

1170
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,333
so we'll see.

1171
00:41:52,333 --> 00:41:53,520
Oh, we have Adam Longo first.

1172
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,630
Okay, so Adam Longo,

1173
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:59,020
he was up by Newcut Road
and 355, or Frederick Road.

1174
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,490
Take a look at the flooding there.

1175
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:03,065
There's that car.
- Clarksburg, Clarksburg area.

1176
00:42:03,065 --> 00:42:05,249
- [Ellen] It's in Clarksburg
area, Montgomery County.

1177
00:42:05,249 --> 00:42:07,350
That car that's over by the
guardrail as you're seeing that,

1178
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:08,370
and Howard and I were talking about this.

1179
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:10,880
You typically see this area
have that kind of high water.

1180
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,390
- [Howard] Yeah, just
south of the middle school.

1181
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:14,020
I live a mile or so north of there,

1182
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:16,280
so this is a very low area on 355.

1183
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,119
- [Ellen] Yeah, Adam's saying

1184
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:18,952
the road's completely washed out.

1185
00:42:18,952 --> 00:42:21,090
Then we have trouble at the
Metro, take a look at this.

1186
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:22,570
This is the Virginia Square Metro,

1187
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:24,455
do you see the water that's rushing

1188
00:42:24,455 --> 00:42:26,730
right into the tracks from above?

1189
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:27,740
It's just coming down.

1190
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:31,630
This is from a viewer,
Nina Farah sent this in.

1191
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:33,600
She said, "I think I'm
gonna be late to work,"

1192
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,270
is what she said with this, I think so,

1193
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:38,210
and she has many other tweets
that she's been sending out,

1194
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:39,370
but water rushing in there,

1195
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:41,900
and then also the C&O
Canal tweeted out this.

1196
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,975
They said their Great Falls entrance,

1197
00:42:43,975 --> 00:42:46,380
the road there is completely closed.

1198
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:47,370
They have trees that are down.

1199
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:49,540
I've seen pictures of
high water there as well,

1200
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:51,410
so we're seeing this all over.

1201
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:52,560
You gotta be careful out there.

1202
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,640
So many swift water rescues happening.

1203
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,810
Be careful out there this morning.

1204
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:57,890
We're gonna take a quick break,

1205
00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:00,448
then we'll come right back
here and continue our coverage.

1229
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:03,820
- Hey guys, what's going on?

1230
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:07,270
So we are here at Salon Virage
with owner himself, Fadi,

1231
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:09,770
and he is about to do a
step by step treatment

1232
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:12,420
on his client called the scalp treatment,

1233
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:13,730
so let's get started.

1234
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:15,681
- So this is the phytopolleine here.

1235
00:44:15,681 --> 00:44:16,560
This is gonna balance your scalp.

1236
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,250
We leave it 30 minutes and after that,

1237
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:19,837
Pam will shampoo her hair.

1238
00:44:19,837 --> 00:44:22,420
(bright music)

1239
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:34,250
- All right Fadi, we just did step one.

1240
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:35,083
What's step two?

1241
00:44:35,083 --> 00:44:36,712
- So now we're gonna do a haircut.

1242
00:44:36,712 --> 00:44:38,751
It's gonna be bob
degrade, which is layers.

1243
00:44:38,751 --> 00:44:41,334
(bright music)

1244
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:44,550
- All right Fadi, you
just finished step two,

1245
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:45,760
so what's step three?

1246
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,995
- Step three is look at the client,

1247
00:44:47,995 --> 00:44:50,278
and then see where it
needs the be texturized

1248
00:44:50,278 --> 00:44:51,740
and then fill in the gaps.

1249
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:53,770
- Oh wow, this looks beautiful.

1250
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:55,630
So if you guys need your hair done,

1251
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:59,580
get down to Salon Virage,
visit them at salonvirage.com,

1252
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:01,460
or you can call the number below.

1253
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:02,620
- After my car accident,

1254
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:04,330
I didn't know that a lawyer would help

1255
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:06,130
deal with all my medical bills.

1256
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:07,870
- I didn't know I could also get money

1257
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:09,110
for pain and suffering.

1258
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:10,650
- I didn't know the insurance company

1259
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:12,900
wasn't going to give me
the settlement I deserved.

1260
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:16,420
- We do know at Saiontz &
Kirk we know injury law,

1261
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:19,310
and we know how to get you
the most money possible.

1262
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:22,730

have collected over $1 billion.

- Well, welcome back to
Great Day Washington.

1273
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:54,750
It's what everyone is
talking about this morning,

1274
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:58,080
besides the storm, it's
the Women's World Cup.

1275
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,180
The U.S. Women's Team is back on top

1276
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:01,500
after beating the Netherlands

1277
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:04,130
two to nothing yesterday in France.

1278
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:06,540
It's the fourth World
Cup title for the U.S.

1279
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:08,701
and the second in a row.

1280
00:46:08,701 --> 00:46:10,230
Let's go to the highlights.

1281
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:12,480
Now the game went into half scoreless,

1282
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,590
but in the second half,

1283
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:17,080
who else but Megan Rapinoe
got the U.S. on board,

1284
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,552
scoring easily on a penalty kick,

1285
00:46:19,552 --> 00:46:21,450
then about six minutes later,

1286
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:23,690
Rose Lavelle scored a beautiful goal

1287
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:26,550
to give the U.S. the two to nothing lead.

1288
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:28,780
Lavelle plays for the Washington Spirit

1289
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:30,770
in the National Women's Soccer League.

1290
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:33,090
It was her third goal of the World Cup.

1291
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:35,410
The goal also helped
the U.S. break a record

1292
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:39,350
for most goals by one team
in a Women's World Cup,

1293
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:41,140
with 26 goals.

1294
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:43,375
And from there, the party was on.

1295
00:46:43,375 --> 00:46:45,534
Megan Rapinoe won the Golden Boot

1296
00:46:45,534 --> 00:46:48,330
for most goals in the World Cup.

1297
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:51,820
She's just the second American
to ever win the award.

1298
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:54,000
Her teammate Alex Morgan

1299
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,380
won the Silver Boot for
the second most goals.

1300
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:59,470
And you'll remember during the tournament,

1301
00:46:59,470 --> 00:47:01,380
Megan Rapinoe sparked some controversy

1302
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:03,250
saying she and the team

1303
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:06,280
would not visit the
White House if they won.

1304
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:09,510
Right now it's unclear if
they'll even be invited,

1305
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:11,417
but President Trump did tweet,

1306
00:47:11,417 --> 00:47:14,307
"Congratulations to the
U.S. Women's Soccer Team

1307
00:47:14,307 --> 00:47:16,367
"on winning the World Cup.

1308
00:47:16,367 --> 00:47:21,120
"Great and exciting play,
America is proud of you all."

1309
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,799
But he stopped short of saying

1310
00:47:22,799 --> 00:47:25,800
if they'd be invited to the White House.

1311
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:28,340
Well either way, we know
the team will be honored

1312
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:31,823
with a ticker tape parade in
New York City on Wednesday.

1313
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:34,451
One out of two isn't bad ether.

1314
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:37,500
Earlier, we told you about
the U.S. Women's Team

1315
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:38,640
winning the World Cup,

1316
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,600
but the Men's Team wasn't
so lucky last night.

1317
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:45,450
They lost one to nothing in
the Gold Cup Final in Chicago.

1318
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:46,790
The Gold Cup features teams

1319
00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:49,880
from North America, Central
America, and the Caribbean.

1320
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:52,640
The game was scoreless
until the 73rd minute

1321
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,940
when Mexico's Jonathan Dos Santos

1322
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:56,950
scored to give Mexico the lead.

1323
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:59,783
This is Mexico's eighth
Gold Cup Championship.

1324
00:47:59,783 --> 00:48:02,913

1394
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:55,620
on what's going on with the
weather here this morning,

1395
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:58,030
because we've had lots of
flooding across the region

1396
00:50:58,030 --> 00:50:59,110
from Frederick to Howard,

1397
00:50:59,110 --> 00:51:01,367
to Montgomery Counties, now into D.C.

1398
00:51:01,367 --> 00:51:03,270
And the heaviest rains are moving south

1399
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:05,920
into Southern Prince
George's, Charles County,

1400
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,430
eventually Calvert and St. Mary's.

1401
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:09,440
I think Virginia, west of the Potomac,

1402
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,840
not looking nearly as bad,

1403
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,690
but we still have some rainfall rates

1404
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:14,875
in Alexandria and Clinton,

1405
00:51:14,875 --> 00:51:17,690
over to Waldorf here, into
Northern Charles County.

1406
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:18,540
Some of these rainfall rates

1407
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:20,100
are three, four, five inches per hour.

1408
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:21,810
That'd be the instantaneous rate,

1409
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:22,710
but you're able to pick up

1410
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:24,470
a quick one to two, three inches of rain,

1411
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:27,222
and that's why we've
got the flash flooding

1412
00:51:27,222 --> 00:51:28,055
and all of these flash flood warnings.

1413
00:51:28,055 --> 00:51:30,920
You'll notice once we get to
Alexandria, north of there,

1414
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:31,753
it's not as bad.

1415
00:51:31,753 --> 00:51:34,913
Still some moderate showers
across the eastern half of D.C.

1416
00:51:34,913 --> 00:51:37,533
with the heaviest stuff
south of Morningside.

1417
00:51:37,533 --> 00:51:40,830
We're gonna take awhile before
the water actually recedes.

1418
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:43,570
So the heaviest rains now in
Vernon, Piscataway, Brandywine,

1419
00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:45,840
now down toward Waldorf
into Charles County.

1420
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,580
Continuing to move to the southeast,

1421
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:50,580
so our friends in Calvert,
Charles County, get ready.

1422
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:52,610
The Charles and Prince George's warning,

1423
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:53,540
the southern Prince George's,

1424
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:56,370
that one goes until one
o'clock this afternoon.

1425
00:51:56,370 --> 00:51:59,090
The good news is, well, we've
had some rainfall rates,

1426
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:00,210
or rainfall actually observed

1428

the afternoon looks better.

1429
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:05,670
We will dry out with highs in the low 80s.

1430
