1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,100
- [Narrator] Right now at
11, tracking the storm.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,530
From the FOX 5 Weather App to Facebook.

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,600
- We are tracking another system.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,200
- [Narrator] We're taking you step by step

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,863
through this winter storm,
approaching in just hours.

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,250
- Our team coverage continues

7
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,070
with preparations for the storm.

8
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,670
Why some road crews are actually

9
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,991
encouraged by Sue's forecast.

10
00:00:19,991 --> 00:00:21,090
(dramatic tone)

11
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,820
- [Narrator] Plus, a bathroom debate

12
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,410
and a fight for student rights goes viral.

13
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,700
How Virginia ended up back
in the national spotlight.

14
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,775
Your news starts now.

15
00:00:30,775 --> 00:00:33,525
(dramatic music)

16
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,500
- We're gonna begin tonight with a winter

17
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,480
weather watch for much of the DC region.

18
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,540
Snow, sleet and freezing
rain are all on the menu

19
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,160
and this winter mix could be nasty,

20
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,950
especially during the morning commute.

21
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,710
- It's prompted just about
every school district

22
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,930
here to cancel class tomorrow along with

23
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:51,950
the federal government.

24
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,050
All of those closures
are listed, of course,

25
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,070
at the bottom of your screen.

26
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,660
For now though, let's
get right to Sue Palka

27
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,680
for a breakdown of when the first flakes

28
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,560
will start falling.

29
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,393
Sue?

30
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:01,226
- Hi there, Sarah.

31
00:01:01,226 --> 00:01:02,280
I think it's gonna be anytime between

32
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,560
about four and six in
the morning here around

33
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,360
the Beltway and yeah, it's morning snow

34
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,430
and a messy, icy mix tomorrow afternoon.

35
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,040
Unfortunately, this does not stay all snow

36
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,500
which would be the better scenario.

37
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,790
It's easier to get rid of.

38
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,300
Ice causes so many problems.

39
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,660
But it does look like we are going

40
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,010
to see that changeover.

41
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,690
As we start with snow that
we now see showing up,

42
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:24,800
especially south of Interstate 64,

43
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,380
that will continue to spread

44
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,740
from southwest to northeast over our area

45
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,680
and by the time you wake
up tomorrow morning,

46
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,370
by sunrise, I think you
will see snow outside.

47
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:34,810
This is all starting to push up.

48
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:36,710
Now, we do not expect much accumulation

49
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:37,543
for southern Virginia.

50
00:01:37,543 --> 00:01:38,840
They'll start with a little bit.

51
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,750
It will quickly changeover down there.

52
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,660
But quite a sprawling system all the way

53
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,290
up to the plains, across
St. Louis to Cincinnati

54
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,820
and now here into the
mid-Atlantic and we will be

55
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,270
dealing with it for many hours tomorrow.

56
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,930
We did have to take our
snow totals down a little

57
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,350
bit today based on the
model output and the

58
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,980
faster changeover to
sleet and freezing rain.

59
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,060
We're still gonna go with
the three to five inches.

60
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,230
It could be closer to
the three inches though

61
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,440
with snow because the
changeover now appears as

62
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,350
though it'll be sometime
in the late morning.

63
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,530
Out here, the changeover's a little later.

64
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,970
We could get a rate of
snow one inch per hour

65
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,420
for a few hours in the morning

66
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,110
and that's where you'll get your pile up,

67
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,360
but unfortunately for all of our area,

68
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,750
this may end, especially in

69
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,850
the northern and western suburbs.

70
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,710
Everybody west of 95 has to watch for

71
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,700
the potential for significant icing as

72
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,533
the temperature begins to,

73
00:02:28,765 --> 00:02:30,070
the temperature a lot begins to rise

74
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,680
and changes that snow over

75
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,230
to that combination of
sleet and freezing rain.

76
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,020
Could a quarter inch of ice be possible

77
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,130
in some of these areas?

78
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,140
We think that is.

79
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:41,010
And that may occur early in the afternoon

80
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,640
and continue until about the time

81
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,580
of the evening rush hour.

82
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,900
So, we wrap it up with a
quick look at your planner.

83
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,430
8 am, 30 degrees, it's snowing.

84
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,150
By the noon hour, we're at 32.

85
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,130
We're mixing across much of the area.

86
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,920
Maybe northern Maryland not quite yet,

87
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,130
or western Maryland.

88
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,790
By four o'clock, it should be raining

89
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,860
here at DC, but possibly, still freezing

90
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,300
rain in our far Northern
and Western suburbs.

91
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,883
Much more to come,
including our hour by hour

92
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:05,820
feature cast just ahead.

93
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,653
Sarah.

94
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,270
- [Sarah] Well, crews have already

95
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:11,610
hit the roads, laying
sand, salt and brine.

96
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,370
Now, they are literally standing by

97
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,100
waiting for the wallop
so they can get to work

98
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,930
on thousands of miles of roadway.

99
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,480
Our team coverage of this approaching

100
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,670
winter storm continues.

101
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,610
FOX 5's Lauren DeMarco joins us

102
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,500
from Fairfax now with the
very latest out there.

103
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,333
Lauren.

104
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,130
- Sarah, it's incredible
to watch these guys

105
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,840
do their work, filling
up truck after truck

106
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,550
with salt and sand.

107
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,040
They are heading out to the interstates

108
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,420
from this saltdom in Fairfax, and they are

109
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,180
asking for help from the public tomorrow,

110
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,573
when all of this wet
stuff starts coming down.

111
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,310
- If everybody stays home, hang out,

112
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,660
watch the Channel Five,
it would be great for us.

113
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,300
- Stay home, stay home, stay home.

114
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,520
- As it's gonna be pretty nasty throughout

115
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,210
the day tomorrow and into
tomorrow night's rush

116
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,660
so we're really asking the folks

117
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,200
to stay off the roads if at all possible.

118
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,360
- [Sarah] A unified
message from transportation

119
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,040
and highway officials in Virginia,

120
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,460
Maryland and the district.

121
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,780
- For folks who do venture out,

122
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,350
I don't know why they would do that,

123
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,430
we want them to obviously fall behind

124
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,520
our snow plows.

125
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,360
- [Sarah] Thousands of
plows and salt trucks

126
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,570
are being deployed across the region,

127
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:17,020
loading up and getting
in place over night.

128
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,720
Preparations actually began over

129
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,120
the last few days, with crews pre-treating

130
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,630
highways, local roads
and known trouble spots

131
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,780
with liquid brine, and officials are

132
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,720
encouraged by the forecast.

133
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,640
- It's gonna be coming in as snow from

134
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,320
what we're hearing, which is beautiful

135
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,730
in terms of interacting with the brine,

136
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:36,200
and we're gonna have 3,000 trucks out,

137
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,477
starting overnight to
be able to push the snow

138
00:04:38,477 --> 00:04:40,440
out of the way, as you see,

139
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,090
they're starting to roll through here.

140
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,380
- [Sarah] Anyone who has to be out,

141
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,120
is urged to prepare with
an emergency supply kit,

142
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,100
charged cell phone and full tank of gas.

143
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,640
Plenty of people heading that advice

144
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,480
at Costco's popular gas station

145
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,880
on Westox Road in Fairfax.

146
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,930
- It's crazy, it's always busy here,

147
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,340
but today's extremely busy.

148
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,570
People think that the sky is gonna fall.

149
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,150
- I think people don't wanna get stuck.

150
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:07,440
- [Sarah] Over at Home
Depot, people stocking up

151
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,880
on ice melt, shovels and
other usual necessities.

152
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,870
- What I'm concerned about is how much

153
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:13,760
snow we're gonna get.

154
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,090
- I have three boys, so
they're gonna be working.

155
00:05:18,707 --> 00:05:21,190
- So, between snow, freezing rain,

156
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,720
or at least freezing precipitation,

157
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,990
and then possibly some
ice, this is expected

158
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:28,120
to impact the next three rush hours.

159
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,970
Vedot told me tonight that because this is

160
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,370
starting with snow and it's expecting

161
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,650
to accumulate, they will
be in the sub-divisions

162
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,960
as well, and they and all of the area

163
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,020
officials are asking that,
in your neighborhood,

164
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,030
try to park in a driveway
or all on one side

165
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,350
of the road, that way the plows

166
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,940
have an easier time getting by.

167
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,240
Back to you in the studio.

168
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,970
- Several area schools are already out

169
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,750
of snow days, in fact, tomorrow's storm

170
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,580
will send more schools over their days

171
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,530
budgeted for weather cancellations.

172
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:56,090
Montgomery Country used its
two make up days already.

173
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,580
Howard County used its four make up days,

174
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,830
if they have to miss any more,

175
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,170
the school district will have to appeal

176
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,620
to the State Board of Education

177
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,160
and ask for forgiveness,
or make adjustments

178
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,440
to the school calendar.

179
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,130
Fairfax, Prince William, Loudoun

180
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,930
and Anne Arundel County Schools

181
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,080
all have days to spare.

182
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,940
- [Sarah] The storm is
forcing Metro to adjust

183
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,210
bus and rail service.

184
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,870
Trains will run every 12 minutes in

185
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,580
the morning to allow workers
to de-ice the tracks.

186
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,180
The schedule could change as the weather

187
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,620
unfolds during the day.

188
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,230
Metro Bus will operate under
severe snow service plans.

189
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:28,270
So, that means buses will provide

190
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,720
limited service on major roadways only,

191
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,830
and Metro access will only provide

192
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,800
return trips home for customers

193
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,040
between four a.m. and seven p.m.

194
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,880
All other trips will be canceled.

195
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,130
And remember, you can
track the weather 24/7

196
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,410
on the FOX 5 Weather app.

197
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,850
You can also get the
latest on FOX 5 Morning,

198
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,013
beginning at 4 a.m.

199
00:06:47,465 --> 00:06:48,540
(intense music)

200
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,470
- Another life lost on
what is being called

201
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,500
the highway of death.

202
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,170
Juan Castillo was killed last night

203
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:55,440
on Indian Head Highway route 210

204
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,860
in Acookeek, Maryland.

205
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,670
Now, the circumstances around
the crash that killed Kim,

206
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,900
are similar to a crash
that killed three children

207
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,950
on that same road back in December.

208
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,320
FOX 5's Lindsay Watts spoke with

209
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,800
Castillo's heartbroken family.

210
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,633
Lindsay.

211
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,270
- Shunning that crash last night

212
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:13,360
and the one in December,
drivers were stopped

213
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,040
at a red light here on Indian Head Highway

214
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,700
when another vehicle came barreling up

215
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,000
from behind and crashed into their car.

216
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,910
We have told you about all of the efforts

217
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,410
to make Indian Head Highway safer,

218
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:30,590
but police say it also falls on drivers

219
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:33,123
to pay attention when
they're behind the wheel.

220
00:07:34,842 --> 00:07:36,170
(speaking in foreign language)

221
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,970
I feel he's my daddy.

222
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,593
I love him so much and I'm gonna miss him.

223
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,940
- [Lindsay] One minute as Castillo

224
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,740
was a father and grandfather.

225
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,290
He was driving with a
family member Monday night

226
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:50,120
about six miles from his home in Waldorph.

227
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,700
- My brother-in-law is driving the car.

228
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,550
- [Sarah] This is what
happened to that vehicle,

229
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,750
a Ford Escape.

230
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,260
According to police, it was stopped

231
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,200
at a red light on Indian Head Highway

232
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,140
on Barry Road in Accokeek.

233
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,970
Investigators say a
female driver didn't stop,

234
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,930
plowing in to the Escape.

235
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:08,430
Menedez Castillo died at the hospital.

236
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,350
Although his family had only recently

237
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,870
moved here from Virginia,

238
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:15,130
they were all well aware
of 210's notoriety.

239
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,320
Menedez Castillo saw news coverage

240
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,270
of the horrifying crash that claimed

241
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,520
the life of three children.

242
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,710
- When I saw that accident pass

243
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,580
on December, he say, oh my God,

244
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,830
everybody has to be careful,
that street is danger.

245
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:29,990
- [Lindsay] Prince George's County Police

246
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,360
have ramped up enforcement on the highway,

247
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,140
issuing 3,700 citations in just
the last months and a half.

248
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,200
There was a DUY checkpoint
earlier this month.

249
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,210
The county is working to get state funding

250
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:44,930
to improve the road, and a bill advancing

251
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,030
in Indianapolis would add up to seven

252
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,920
roving speed cameras.

253
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,770
Right now, there is only one permanent

254
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,630
speed camera on 210.

255
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:55,670
- I think they're doing
everything I can think of.

256
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,200
- [Lindsay] The road is such a hazard,

257
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,820
there's a community group devoted

258
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,050
to making it safer.

259
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:01,363
Ron Weiss is part of that.

260
00:09:01,363 --> 00:09:05,500
- When we think of 210 as our main street,

261
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:10,300
and it's just not a good feeling

262
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,700
when you go out on your main street

263
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,600
and worry about being killed.

264
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,540
- [Lindsay] He says these
recent fatal crashes

265
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,990
have been preventable,
and it's up to drivers

266
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,373
to take back control.

267
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,450
Back here live now, the crash last night

268
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,250
is still under investigation.

269
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,910
Police are trying to find out why

270
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,400
that female driver didn't stop.

271
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,044
Back to you.

272
00:09:31,044 --> 00:09:32,350
(intense music)

273
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,750
- [Sarah] New at 11 now, Virginia House

274
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,520
Democrats today said they are treating

275
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,380
the sexual assault allegations against

276
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,350
Lieutenant Governor
Justin Fairfax seriously.

277
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,510
In a statement they said, we respect all

278
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:45,490
survivors and believe they
should be fully heard.

279
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,470
In response, the attorney for accuser,

280
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,670
Meredith Watson said, apparently,

281
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,230
the Virginia House Democratic Caucus

282
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,330
believes that courageous victims of rape

283
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,700
need to be heard, just not by them.

284
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,650
Miss Watson is counting
on the General Assembly

285
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:00,253
to do the right thing
and hold hearings now.

286
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,520
- [Sarah] The gunman who shot up a car

287
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,760
outside a popular ice
arena in the district

288
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,150
is still on the run tonight.

289
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,390
The shooting happened this afternoon

290
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,940
near the Fort Dupont Ice
Arena in the Southeast.

291
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,950
The gunman shot two men and a child,

292
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,650
one man is critical, the other two

293
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,470
are expected to be okay.

294
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,440
Tonight, police are looking
for a silver Hyundai

295
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,440
that might be connected to the shooting.

296
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:21,900
- Good news for Southeast DC families

297
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,270
who rely on the Fort Dupont Ice Arena,

298
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,900
the city's only full-size, public,

299
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,680
indoor ice rink, will get
a much needed facelift

300
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,450
thanks to a deal reached
between Mayor Bowser

301
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,820
and the friends of Fort Dupont ice arena,

302
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,860
the non-profit that runs that rink.

303
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,800
If the group raises three million

304
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,670
of the $30 million expansion budget

305
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,730
by next February, the city will sign

306
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,820
the contract to start the project.

307
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,050
The expansion will create
a new two-rink arena.

308
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:46,883
- [Announcer] Well, from the ice

309
00:10:46,883 --> 00:10:48,730
to the ball field, the
Washington Nationals had

310
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:51,450
their first squad spring
training workout today.

311
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,000
The Nets play their first practice game

312
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,280
in four days in West Palm Beach, Florida.

313
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,290
Looks like the weather's
a lot nicer there.

314
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,400
By the way, Net superstar Bryce Harper

315
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,660
is not on the field, he's
a free agent right now

316
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,480
and still has not signed with the team.

317
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,720
- Some Montgomery County High School

318
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,750
students have been
encouraging other students

319
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,890
to use a racial slur and, of course,

320
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,280
it's stirring some controversy.

321
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,980
- Evan Lambert is working
on that story tonight.

322
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,000
Evan.

323
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,230
- Sian, parents and
school leaders met tonight

324
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,780
to talk about solutions to what

325
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,820

County High School

have been encouraging other
students to use a racial slur.

417
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,580
Some students have actually been sharing

418
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,730
a card that gives other students a pass

419
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,070
to use the N word.

420
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,650

425
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,850
on February 8th at Winston Church Hill

426
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,700
High School in Patomac, Maryland.

427
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,750
Tonight, concerned parents and students

428
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,720
wanted to hear what the schools plan was

429
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,470
to discourage racist language and acts.

430
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,320
This is what the passes looked like.

431
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,900
They're based on a meme of a Willy

432
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,360
Wonka Golden Ticket.

433
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,730
The holder, according to the ticket,

434
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,810
gets permission to use the N word.

435
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:30,500
Tonight, school officials said they have

436
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,270
come up with a plan to
be rolled out in phases

437
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,770
to turn the episode
into a teachable moment.

438
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:39,080
Students would be educated
about racism and equality.

439
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,170
A group of about 40 student leaders

440
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:43,360
have already met about how they can talk

441
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,390
to other students.

442
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,360
Many parents thought using the students

443
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,090
own voices to educate each other

444
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,430
would be most effective.

445
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,100
- I mean, we all came here thinking that

446
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,750
there was a plan in play, and there is

447
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,100
a lot of brain-storming going on,

448
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,010
which is good, but at the end of the day,

449
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,890
I think that it's gonna
take way more than that.

450
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:01,840
Peer pressure is huge in high school,

451
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,090
and if we can use that for good,

452
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,700
and have them influence their peers

453
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,500
and say, just because
you hear it in a song,

454
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,120
that doesn't mean it's okay.

455
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,948
- It starts with the kids,

456
00:16:11,948 --> 00:16:13,380
it starts with the parents,

457
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,560
it starts with the school, the teachers,

458
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,030
everybody collectively play a role

459
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:21,220
and making a change.

460
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,610
- Back when the passes were discovered,

461
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,760
principal Brandis Hecor
called the incident, quote,

462
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,120
a racist, hateful act that does not

463
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,330
reflect the values of Churchill students.

464
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,010
The students involved
have been disciplined

465
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:33,400
in accordance with the code of conduct.

466
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,233
Sarah.

467
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,520
- Jussie Smolletts
lawyers insist The Empire

468
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,110
actor did not orchestrate assault,

469
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:42,160
despite speculation that he paid two men

470
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,390
to attack him on a Chicago street.

471
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,180
The two brothers, who
were initially questioned

472
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,370
and released, reportedly
told police Smollett

473
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:51,550
paid them to rehearse and
carry out the assault.

474
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:54,260
They also said Smollett was
upset there was not enough

475
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,080
attention being paid to a threatening

476
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,690
letter he had received.

477
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,740
The FBI has joined a
separate investigation

478
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,750
in to that letter, and
investigators believe

479
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,980
Smollett may have sent
that letter to himself.

480
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,700
- A Virginia school
district is now considering

481
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,870
a new proposal to allow
transgender students

482
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,780
to use the restroom of their choice.

483
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,530
Dozens of people turned
out for a school board

484
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,100
hearing in Gloucester County tonight

485
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,310
to discuss the plan.

486
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,910
It would allow transgender students

487
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,180
to use the restroom of choice,

488
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,730
as long as they assert their new gender

489
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,780
identity for at least six months.

490
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,070
The proposal would reverse
the county's current policy

491
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,700
that's been a subject of a lawsuit

492
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,220
since it was adopted back in 2014.

493
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,110
That proposal said students could only use

494
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,330
the restroom that corresponded

495
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:32,673
with their sex at birth.

496
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:35,820
- [Sarah] It almost
looks like the real deal,

497
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,780
but it's not.

498
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,410
Fake money, mainly one
hundred dollar bills,

499
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,920
is making its way around
Northern Virginia.

500
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,860
But there are some easy ways to spot

501
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,710
the counterfeit bills and
avoid becoming a victim

502
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,473
or to avoid passing it along.

503
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,140
- [Narrator] You can see
on this counterfeit bill

504
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:55,623
it says for motion picture use only.

505
00:17:57,822 --> 00:18:00,480
A lot of the security
features aren't there.

506
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,250
When we compare to this
legitimate $100 bill,

507
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,693
you can see the difference in color,

508
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,950
there's a different feel on the texture.

509
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,630
- [Sarah] The Stafford
County Sheriff's Office

510
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:16,100
there saying they have no
idea right now how many

511
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,953
fake bills are in circulation in the area.

512
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,340
- All right, well we will have some snow,

513
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,557
and maybe some sleet, rain, ice,

514
00:18:23,557 --> 00:18:25,540
and circulation in our area tomorrow.

515
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,749
- There's our forecast.

516
00:18:26,749 --> 00:18:27,582
(laughs)
- Thank you, Sian.

517
00:18:27,582 --> 00:18:28,540
- Good night, everyone.

518
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,373
It's been a long day.

519
00:18:29,373 --> 00:18:30,489
- You wish, stay.

520
00:18:30,489 --> 00:18:31,322
(laughs)

521
00:18:31,322 --> 00:18:32,155
- Well, I've gotta show you how close

522
00:18:32,155 --> 00:18:33,550
it's getting, and fortunately for us,

523
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,700
we get to get home before this starts,

524
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,240
but if you have a
morning commute tomorrow,

525
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,750
and I know a lot of schools have canceled,

526
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,130
the government has
canceled, I'm glad about it

527
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,542
because the snow could be falling

528
00:18:42,542 --> 00:18:45,830
very intensely, so
visibility is a problem.

529
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,920
And, while the roads have
been brined and treated,

530
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,890
if we do get a burst of some moderate

531
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,540
to heavy snow that falls at a rate

532
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,311
of an inch per hour, even
for three or four hours,

533
00:18:54,311 --> 00:18:56,380
that could be a real problem.

534
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,400
And, temperatures are
going to continue to drop,

535
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,430
we're at 38 degrees, so there will be

536
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,420
stickage tomorrow morning.

537
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,980
It's not the coldest night, so that means

538
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,910
this will be, somewhat, slushy, wet snow

539
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:08,750
as it falls, heavy wet
snow, and we'll see this

540
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,110
primarily in the morning hours,

541
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,930
and then the changeover
late morning to noon.

542
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:15,140
That timing of the changeover
is going to be crucial,

543
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:18,730
but overnight temperatures
near 30 to about 32 degrees.

544
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,150
Here's our storm tracker radar,

545
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,330
and you can see that we do see snow

546
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:25,900
trying to expand, certainly
aloft, north of 64 now.

547
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,740
Is it hitting the ground down there?

548
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,980
Probably not just yet,
we've got some dry air

549
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,810
to overcome briefly, but you can see

550
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:34,710
that is all making steady
progress south west to north east.

551
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,230
And we still expect it in here

552
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:39,010
between about six to seven in the morning,

553
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,240
crossing the beltway.

554
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,140
Big storm, as you know,
it has had an impact

555
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,920
for Nebraska, for Kansas, for Oklahoma,

556
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,317
for St Louis, it's pushing
in to Cincinnati now

557
00:19:48,317 --> 00:19:49,840
and the leading edge of that has all

558
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,690
turned over to snow, and
that's what we expect

559
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,840
to see in all our area
as early as six o'clock.

560
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,880
Again, south west to north east.

561
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,230
You can see the blue showing all the snow

562
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,340
that's around our area,

563
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:04,050
and this will continue for a few hours.

564
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,280
Watch this, the pink, and our model

565
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,650
brings that in right about 11 o'clock.

566
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,880
Now, this did update
just a little while ago,

567
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,210
and it holds the snow in
just a little bit longer

568
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:16,340
so, maybe that changeover
is closer to the noon hour.

569
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,830
But this is where we start
to see the sleet coming in,

570
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,150
the little ice pellets
that tick on your window.

571
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,900
At two o'clock, DC looks
like it will be able to rain,

572
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,220
we still have a bit of snow
in north eastern Maryland.

573
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,930
but all of this may be icing and sleet

574
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,900
and freezing rain may begin to accumulate.

575
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,560
A quarter inch of ice could be

576
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,650
a problem for many
areas as we work our way

577
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,520
through the early part of the afternoon.

578
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,300
Eventually, it's all rain.

579
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,320
Especially by the time
of the evening rush hour,

580
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,170
but there will be pockets
where there is still

581
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:44,400
lingering, freezing rain, there always is,

582
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,330
and that's where we
worry about accumulation

583
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,370
on trees and limbs that could present

584
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:50,880
some power outages and certainly some

585
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,660
tricky travel in those areas.

586
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,220
Here's our 10 o'clock future cast.

587
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,340
It's mostly rain, and
by the time we get to

588
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,960
Thursday morning at 7
a.m. it is out of here.

589
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,360
If you haven't seen this before,

590
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,370
generally we're going
for a three to five inch

591
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:04,650
snow fall amount, especially
through the Metro area.

592
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:06,200
Could be closer to the three inch amount

593
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,000
if the changeover happens sooner.

594
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,160
Five inch amount if that
changeover happens later.

595
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,340
We think the heavier snow,
five to eight inches out here,

596
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,620
where there will also be a problem

597
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,690
with ice in the afternoon,

598
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,340
maybe you'll get a quarter inch out there.

599
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,160
One to three inches south and
east for southern Maryland.

600
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,940
Comparing models, that's
what we're putting out there.

601
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,820
Yesterday, this model was very aggressive

602
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,730
with snow, it did come down today,

603
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:29,510
but this is still a
pretty significant snow,

604
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,520
the American model, and
last thing I'll show

605
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,240
you here is the European model.

606
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,450
It's been sticking with a less impactful

607
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:40,040
snow part of the storm, but still can see

608
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,870
the ice in the afternoon and this is

609
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:44,750
two and a half to six
inches around the area.

610
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,150
So, we feel pretty good that those numbers

611
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,820
are going to be what we end up getting.

612
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:51,560
But we know it's going to
be a messy day regardless,

613
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,310
and Thursday we start to
melt it off, 49 degrees.

614
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,870
Friday we continue the melting.

615
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:59,860
We do have rain on Saturday,
with a temperature of 44.

616
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,450
We could see the rain linger
in to the first part of Sunday,

617
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:04,500
but I think most of the day Sunday

618
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,660
is going to be milder

619
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:08,400
and eventually pretty dry at 64 degrees.

620
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,400
Monday it's sunny.

621
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,950
Tuesday we have another
chance of a rain-snow mix

622
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:13,220
that we have to keep an eye on.

623
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,450
With a temperature of 47 on Tuesday.

624
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,930
We'll be watching that one closely

625
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:18,450
and you can continue to monitor that,

626
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,330
as well as other developments as we work

627
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:22,690
our way, hour by hour, through a tricky

628
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:24,170
Wednesday around here that could really

629
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:26,240
be problematic on the roads by downloading

630
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,090
the FOX 5 Weather App.

631
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:28,990
Sian, back to you.

632
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:32,200
- Space, that's the next step,

633
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,633
and we have to be prepared.

634
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:36,140
- [Sian] President Trump's goal to add

635
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,780
a sixth branch to the military

636
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,810
is a step closer to becoming reality.

637
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:42,520
Today, we signed a directive
to establish the space force.

638
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,493
If approved by congress,

639
00:22:43,493 --> 00:22:45,860
the branch would be allowed, excuse me

640
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,310
would allow the department of defense

641
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,283
to handle all space operations.

642
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:51,990
- [Sarah] Former president Barack Obama

643
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:54,500
turning up at an event
at Oakland, California.

644
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,750
