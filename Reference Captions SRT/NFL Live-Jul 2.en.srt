1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,570
- We heard Adrian talk about
it, there's no interest.

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:04,120
When there's no interest,
guess what kind of deal's

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,130
available to you, the minimum exception.

4
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:07,700
So we might as well put all 30 teams in.

5
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:08,690
- Right, no, that's very interesting.

6
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:10,700
Well, we're gonna have to see.

7
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,920
We might know more by tonight, right?

8
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,220
Could know about Kawhi by tonight.

9
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,070
Could know about Boogie by tonight.

10
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:19,091
Come hang out with us,
7:00 eastern on ESPN.

11
00:00:19,091 --> 00:00:21,760
Until then, watch your phones
cause it's free agency.

12
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,242
Lot's going on.
- Come on US team,

13
00:00:23,242 --> 00:00:24,242
let's do it!

14
00:00:26,258 --> 00:00:29,425
(hip hop theme music)

15
00:00:33,641 --> 00:00:36,308
(intense music)

16
00:00:45,317 --> 00:00:47,280
- [Wendi] Coming up on
this Tuesday edition

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,573
of NFL Live, JuJu Smith-Schuster joins us.

18
00:00:49,573 --> 00:00:53,130
He'll talk about taking over
as Steelers top receiver

19
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,850
and what his relationship with
Antonio Brown looks like now.

20
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,290
We highlight some of the
NFL stars that are nominated

21
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:02,500
for ESPYS, including a
look back at Drew Brees's

22
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,370
record-breaking Monday
Night Football performance.

23
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,010
Plus, we hand out our
own award for the player

24
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,830
with the best highlights,
Patrick Mahomes, Saquon,

25
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,090
or Kyler in the running.

26
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,840
Who will be crowned your Highlight King?

27
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,160
Happy to have you with us on this

28
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,360
Tuesday afternoon, holiday week.

29
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,510
Wendi Nix, Dianna Russini,
Victor Cruz, and Mike Tannenbaum.

30
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:25,990
We will start with news
regarding Cowboys running back,

31
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:27,160
Ezekiel Elliott.

32
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,230
Zeke is once again headed to
the Commissioner's office.

33
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,470
The Dallas Cowboys running
back expected to meet

34
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:35,830
with the Commissioner, Roger
Goodell, today in New York City

35
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:39,030
regarding a May incident in Las Vegas.

36
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,690
The meeting comes after an incident

37
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,640
at a Las Vegas music festival in May,

38
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,200
in which Elliott had a
confrontation of sorts

39
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,240
with a security guard.

40
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,490
He was briefly detained, but
never arrested or charged

41
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,380
in the incident.

42
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,610
Nevertheless, the commissioner
wants to hear him out.

43
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,443
Hear what happened.

44
00:01:54,443 --> 00:01:55,910
Dianna, what more can you tell us?

45
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,310
- Oh, at this point right now,

46
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,760
we don't know what exactly
is going on in that meeting.

47
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,720
But they are meeting in Manhattan
to discuss Zeke's behavior

48
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,750
in that Las Vegas incident.

49
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,170
Jerry Jones, of course, has
stood by his running back

50
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,310
saying that he doesn't see anything wrong

51
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,270
with what he saw on video tape.

52
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,689
Again, Zeke was in
those handcuffs and then

53
00:02:14,689 --> 00:02:17,340
those handcuffs were
removed, he was not charged.

54
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,540
He could still face
punishment if Goodell decides

55
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,600
that he violated the League's
personal conduct policy.

56
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,630
That's what this meeting is to discuss.

57
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,850
But as of now, we are not
sure what the future holds

58
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:32,090
but those that I've spoken to
with the Cowboys organization

59
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:36,690
strongly feel confident that
Zeke will not face a suspension

60
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,100
because of this incident.

61
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,780
- Mike, as a GM, I know you have players

62
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,400
who have had face to face
meetings with the Commissioner,

63
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,510
who had hearings or due
diligence, if you will.

64
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,220
What's your take on the process?

65
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,910
- Despite how the Cowboys are feeling,

66
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,980
a suspension certainly is in play.

67
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,210
We have to remember under
the personal conduct policy,

68
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,970
a player can be suspended even though

69
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,880
there may not be criminal charges.

70
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,000
And the fact that Ezekiel
Elliott is meeting

71
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,780
in person with the
Commissioner signals to me

72
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,101
that a suspension, albeit
one game, two games,

73
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:08,170
could be in play here, and
he was sent to New York

74
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,003
for a reason.

75
00:03:09,003 --> 00:03:11,360
So we'll see how it plays
out in the coming days.

76
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,110
But his prior behavior
will certainly be a factor

77
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,410
in their assessment.

78
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,190
- Well let's shift gears
to between the lines.

79
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,650
Victor, how important is the run game

80
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,543
to this current Dallas Cowboys team?

81
00:03:20,543 --> 00:03:22,640
- It's huge, especially
Ezekiel Elliott, right?

82
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,350
He's been the focal point of that offense,

83
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,130
especially from the
running back perspective,

84
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:27,660
year in and year out.

85
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,160
Things he can do with
the ball in his hands,

86
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,160
whether out in space or just
handing him the football

87
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,430
behind that fantastic offensive line.

88
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:37,170
I mean, he is, in my opinion,
the heartbeat of that offense.

89
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,830
Obviously, Dak is the leader,
but Ezekiel is the one

90
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:40,663
that makes them go.

91
00:03:40,663 --> 00:03:42,710
As he does well, then you've
got the play action pass

92
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,470
and everything complements

93
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,220
the attributes of Ezekiel Elliott.

94
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,890
So obviously, if he's there to miss

95
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,860
any significant amount of time,

96
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,850
the Cowboys will be looking
to replace those statistics

97
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,090
and those numbers that he
puts up week in and week out

98
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,210
in a different way.

99
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,560
- [Mike] Yeah, and Vic, you
just hit the nail on the head.

100
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,770
When you look at Dak
Prescott, his pass rating

101
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:05,840
goes from 97 to 122, play action compared

102
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,090
to traditional drop back.

103
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,133
So you could see the
importance of the running game.

104
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:12,830
Ezekiel Elliott and
obviously opposing defenses

105
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,380
are focusing in on
stopping Ezekiel Elliott.

106
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,760
That's a very impactful,
in terms of his impact

107
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,510
on Prescott's production
to go from 97 to 122,

108
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:25,360
that's a huge jump in terms of
his play action productivity.

109
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,117
- A huge jump, and we'll
talk about Dak's deal

110
00:04:27,117 --> 00:04:29,441
and when it may get done,
but I'd be interested to see

111
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:31,410
how all of you feel like
this Dallas Cowboys team

112
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,146
stacks up in the division.

113
00:04:33,146 --> 00:04:34,670
- I think they're right there at the top.

114
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,670
I think they're competing,
obviously them and Philadelphia,

115
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,503
right there neck and neck.

116
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:40,440
Gonna be battling it out
throughout the season.

117
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,590
But I think they've got all the tools.

118
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,040
When you look at them defensively,

119
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,450
from the defensive line all the way back

120
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,950
to the secondary, they're
loaded at each position.

121
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,760
And then offensively,
like we just talked about,

122
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,570
Dak Prescott, Ezekiel Elliott,
Amari Cooper, Randall Cobb,

123
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,150
Jason, I could go on for days with this.

124
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,426
But they have all the talent.

125
00:04:55,426 --> 00:04:56,570
- [Mike] All the receivers.

126
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,735
- [Victor] Exactly, they
got all of the talent,

127
00:04:58,735 --> 00:04:59,575
and not to mention--

128
00:04:59,575 --> 00:05:00,785
- [Wendi] They have a new
offensive coordinator which--

129
00:05:00,785 --> 00:05:01,650
- [Victor] Kellen Moore, obviously.

130
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,420
Which obviously comes from college

131
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,360
and doing those different things.

132
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,120
So he'll provide some creativity

133
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,610
that we probably haven't seen.

134
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,180
Some different type of
plays that we haven't seen,

135
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,920
necessarily, from the Dallas Cowboys.

136
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,204
- You're not going with the Eagles,

137
00:05:16,204 --> 00:05:17,037
you're going with the Dallas Cowboys

138
00:05:17,037 --> 00:05:17,870
to win that division?

139
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,020
- Yes, unfortunately, nobody
in New York kill me, please.

140
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,022
But I'm going with the Cowboys.

141
00:05:21,022 --> 00:05:23,470
- That's right, don't, that was Victor.

142
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:24,880
When does Dak's deal get done?

143
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,700
Do we see that done before
the start of the season?

144
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,620
- I think that deal will get done

145
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,750
before the start of the season.

146
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,180
In fact, even just talking to people

147
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,660
in the Cowboys organization
about the timing of it,

148
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:38,030
it's funny cause just a few months ago,

149
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,000
the way it was being explained to me was,

150
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,120
it was gonna be a while,
it wasn't gonna get done.

151
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,610
And now it seems that, I'm not sure where

152
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,443
the pressure's coming from.

153
00:05:45,443 --> 00:05:47,570
I don't know why they're
feeling the pressure,

154
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,080
but in terms of trying to get that done,

155
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,300
it seems that that's gonna
be a priority for Dallas.

156
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,880
- You know, the pressure really comes from

157
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,540
what Dak Prescott's draft
day disappointment was,

158
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,340
is now becoming the reality
of a free agent opportunity.

159
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,460
Because he was not a first round pick,

160
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,670
which was a disappointment.

161
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,120
But he's now in the final
year of his rookie contract.

162
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,010
So unlike guys like Jared
Goff and Carson Wentz,

163
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,820
who had the additional fifth year,

164
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,580
he could get to the
market and he may not be

165
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,940
a perfect player, I'm a
believer in Dak Prescott.

166
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,450
Not cause only, what he can
do from a passing standpoint,

167
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,280
but the plays he makes with his legs.

168
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,020
If he made it to the open market

169
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,070
the way Kirk Cousins
did a couple years ago,

170
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,590
hard to say what he could get.

171
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,900
And, I know people could say well,

172
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,600
he could certainly get franchised,

173
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,930
but I could tell you from
an organization standpoint,

174
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,330
when you use the franchise tag,

175
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:34,010
the last position you wanna
use it on is the quarterback.

176
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,220
Because when you have a franchise tag,

177
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,890
that means that the player
doesn't have to be there

178
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:39,240
for the off-season program,

179
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,640
doesn't have to be
there for training camp.

180
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,080
He could come in the
Tuesday before opening day,

181
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,360
sign the tag, get paid
for the whole season,

182
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,050
and it really puts the whole offense

183
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,180
and all those reps that you
don't have together, Vic.

184
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,180
So it's really a situation where

185
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,060
the sense of urgency, Dianna, in my mind,

186
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,170
it's coming from the fact that this player

187
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:58,740
is 16 games away from
becoming a free agent.

188
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,940
- And then that quarterback
also feels that pressure.

189
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,670
And they don't ever really
feel like they belong.

190
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,600
Do you remember with the Kirk Cousins

191
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,207
situation in Washington?

192
00:07:05,207 --> 00:07:08,480
He was always out there proving
and proving and proving.

193
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,090
I remember talking to him about it.

194
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,690
You could tell it was wearing on him,

195
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:15,110
because it was like, the
Washington Redskins organization,

196
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,960
they were just looking to
date and date and date,

197
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,060
and he was looking for a ring.

198
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,840
He wanted to get married and
he wanted to feel that love.

199
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,919
And he never did.

200
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,220
For the Cowboys to put that on Dak,

201
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:27,380
that may not work out for them
if they wanna make that work.

202
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,980
- You know what he's married to, money.

203
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:32,620
A lot of money, I am not
crying for Kirk Cousins.

204
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,280
But it is a point well made.

205
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,340
All right, anyway, circling
back to where we started.

206
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,850
That is Zeke Elliott, the
Cowboys certainly hoping

207
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,810
that he will not miss any time.

208
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,080
A video shows Browns
running back Kareem Hunt

209
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,520

210
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,900
incident Saturday night.

with a number of officers.

214
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,230
He was not arrested, they
did not make a police report

215
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,560
regard the incident.

216
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,340

- [Wendi] Press coverage now,
from our own Dan Graziano.

332
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,070
Sources according to Dan, CBA,

333
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,450
that's collective bargaining agreement,

334
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:46,760
talks between the NFL and
the player's association

335
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,010
are expected to intensify this summer

336
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:52,810
in an effort to get a new
deal done by the start

337
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:54,950
of the 2019 season.

338
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:58,120
Three to four negotiating
sessions possible

339
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
in the month of July alone.

340
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,370
Former Packers wide
receiver, Randall Cobb,

341
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:05,360
signed by the Cowboys in free agency,

342
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,330
teamed up with Aaron Rodgers for over

343
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:10,870
5,000 receiving yards after being drafted

344
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,510
by the Pack in 2011.

345
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:15,840
He will face his former
team week five in Dallas.

346
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,937
He had to say this about
moving on from Green Bay.

347
00:13:19,937 --> 00:13:22,167
"It's like the ex-girlfriend
that broke up with you.

348
00:13:22,167 --> 00:13:24,747
"When you see her five years
later, you hope you're in

349
00:13:24,747 --> 00:13:26,987
"a better situation than you were before.

350
00:13:26,987 --> 00:13:30,227
"Married, with kids,
and you're able to say,

351
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:32,940
"Yeah, I did better without you."

352
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,060
You know what, he's right.

353
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,670
No body says that, but
that's how everybody feels.

354
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,752
- Yeah, but not every breakup
has to be contentious.

355
00:13:37,752 --> 00:13:38,585
- It doesn't matter.

356
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:40,000
I don't care if it's
the best breakup ever,

357
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,230
you don't wanna be like,
oh life wasn't so great.

358
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:44,160
- You're winning, I'm not.

359
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,240
- You wanna win, sorry,
it just is what it is.

360
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,520
OK, anyway, that got us
thinking five years from now,

361
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,353
who's better off?

362
00:13:50,353 --> 00:13:54,060
OK, we saw a number of
NFL breakups, if you will.

363
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,370
So again, five year mark.

364
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,700
Randall Cobb or the Green Bay
Packers, who's better off?

365
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,120
- I'm going with Randall Cobb.

366
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,870
I think he's joining a team in the Cowboys

367
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,310
that's a younger team.

368
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:05,880
I think they're an overall
better team right now

369
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,120
than the Green Bay Packers.

370
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,350
But I think in five years,
he'll be in the playoffs

371
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,549
a couple times.

372
00:14:11,549 --> 00:14:13,990
He's obviously in the mix
of that wide receiving core.

373
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:16,100
He's gonna be a focal point
in that slot position.

374
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,690
That's an important position
now a days in the NFL.

375
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,760
And I think overall, he'll just be better.

376
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,820
Dak Prescott, he's got
a younger quarterback.

377
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,130
I think that'll serve him better.

378
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,700
Obviously giving that longevity

379
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,970
and be there for a couple years.

380
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:30,420
He can built that comradery
and that continuity

381
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,043
with Dak, which will serve him
better five years from now.

382
00:14:33,043 --> 00:14:35,920
- All right, he's not gonna
miss Aaron Rodgers at all, no.

383
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,800
- They're a better overall team.

384
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,605
- Again, five years, we
don't know, a lot can happen.

385
00:14:41,605 --> 00:14:42,640
- They're younger.

386
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,810
- All right, listen, in my opinion,

387
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:48,050
no more notable breakup
than that one between

388
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,700
Odell Beckham Jr and the New York Giants.

389
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,380
This one's easy if you talk about now,

390
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,380
but we're talking about
five years from now.

391
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,950
Dianna, who's better off?

392
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:57,290
- I'm gonna go Odell
Beckham Jr is gonna be

393
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,890
in a much better position.

394
00:14:58,890 --> 00:14:59,950
Well first of all, he got paid.

395
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:02,110
He got tons of money
and he has opportunity

396
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,770
to make more money.

397
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:07,530
Price of living in Cleveland
is lower, taxes are lower.

398
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,680
So from a personal financial standpoint,

399
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,460
Odell Beckham Jr is winning big time.

400
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,580
But when it comes to football,

401
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,010
there's no quarterback that
I believe has more potential

402
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:20,550
to be one of the greatest, than I believe,

403
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,920
in what Baker Mayfield could do.

404
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,473
In terms of the continuity and the team

405
00:15:25,473 --> 00:15:26,930
that they're building in Cleveland,

406
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,850
compared to what they're
doing in New York.

407
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,690
We're not sure what's gonna
happen to Pat Shurmur,

408
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:31,810
if he's gonna be there.

409
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:34,220
You have to feel like he
could be on the hot seat

410
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,420
this year if it doesn't work.

411
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:38,120
It seems that Cleveland
is a much better off space

412
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,470
for Odell Beckham Jr, so I think
he's gonna look back and go

413
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,680
you know what, that was good.

414
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,513
- That was good.

415
00:15:42,513 --> 00:15:44,970
What's interesting is the
Giants had a couple of breakups.

416
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:47,500
Also Landon Collins, who's
better off in five years?

417
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,950
- Yeah, I'm gonna go the
other way here, Dianna.

418
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,550
I'm gonna go with the New York Giants.

419
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,530
Dave Gettleman and that front office.

420
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:53,980
When we look at what they've already done

421
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,210
to replace Landon Collins.

422
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:58,100
They acquired Antoine
Bethea in free agency

423
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,260
and Jabrill Peppers, that
was part of the trade

424
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,350
that send Odell Beckham Jr--

425
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,183
- [Wendi] First rounder, yep.

426
00:16:02,183 --> 00:16:03,450
- [Mike] To Cleveland.

427
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:05,050
And although Collins is a good player,

428
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:06,220
I thought he was more productive

429
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,640
closer to the line of scrimmage.

430
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,680
I think when you look at
the way Peppers plays,

431
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,513
he can replace him.

432
00:16:10,513 --> 00:16:12,750
He's younger, more athletic,
and less expensive.

433
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,610
So Wendi, it's not five
years, we know right now.

434
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:17,240
We're better off without Landon.

435
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,180
- Wow, all right, fair enough, noted.

436
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,710
You know, I said there
was no bigger breakup.

437
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:26,460
As soon as I said that I thought
about AB and the Steelers.

438
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,440
I'm gonna retract that.

439
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,660
But anyway, Antonio
Brown and the Steelers.

440
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,780
This one, I think, is tricky.

441
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:34,700
'Cause again, we're five
seasons out, who's better off?

442
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,870
- I'm going with the Steelers here.

443
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,920
I really feel like the Steelers
organization as a whole,

444
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,460
they're gonna turn the page fully

445
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,700
from the Antonio Brown drama.

446
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,060
They're gonna be looking to
JuJu, he's gonna be tenured.

447
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,030
He's gonna be a true
veteran leader on that team.

448
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:48,980
Understand who he is.

449
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,430
Big Ben, who knows how
many years he has left,

450
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:53,500
but with that body frame, and
if he takes care of himself,

451
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,110
he can still be there five years from now

452
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,450
playing at a high level.

453
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,870
But these guys are ready to play.

454
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,010
I think as a team, as a perspective,

455
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,230
once they get rid of the drama
and get rid of the negativity

456
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,760
that was surrounding the
team with Le'Veon Bell

457
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,330
and all of these things, I
think five years from now,

458
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,380
this team will be better,
Ben Roethlisberger

459
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,853
will be relaxed, and the
team will be good to go.

460
00:17:10,853 --> 00:17:12,460
- All right, perfect segue.

461
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:15,110
How about Le'Veon Bell and
the Pittsburgh Steelers?

462
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,980
- Well, I think we saw a
little bit of a sneak preview

463
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,390
last year, right?

464
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:20,149
Bell was a Steeler, but he really wasn't.

465
00:17:20,149 --> 00:17:20,982
- Not really.

466
00:17:20,982 --> 00:17:22,450
- So we're gonna go with
the Pittsburgh Steelers,

467
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,690
and obviously we're
talking about James Conner,

468
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,580
who filled in last year for Le'Veon Bell.

469
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,570
We have another year with him
now in the off-season program,

470
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,790
and I think really where
we're gonna miss Bell, guys,

471
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,660
isn't as a rusher, but as a receiver.

472
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,250
But James Conner is a
really good running back.

473
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,950
He's productive between the tackles,

474
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:40,190
he's a good pass protector,
and again, another year

475
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,457
of growing into the job,
I think Pittsburgh year in

476
00:17:42,457 --> 00:17:45,430
and year out does a great
job of letting guys move on.

477
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:48,160
I think that replacing
Bell, I agree with Victor,

478
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,700
and I think, replace AB, I
think they're gonna replace Bell

479
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,360
very well with James Conner.

480
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,206
- I do think that team has sort of rallied

481
00:17:56,206 --> 00:17:58,240
around these departures, that's now.

482
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,830
We'll see where they are in a few seasons.

483
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,450
This last one, I don't
even think you can count it

484
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,400
as a breakup, I'm not sure
they even really dated.

485
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,687
I don't know, they went out.

486
00:18:05,687 --> 00:18:06,520
- It was a hook-up.

487
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,520
- It was a hook-up, Josh
Rosen and the Cardinals.

488
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,710
- I think Josh Rosen
is gonna be better off.

489
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:14,590
Look, this kid had the weight of the world

490
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,550
on his shoulders.

491
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:18,400
He was a top draft pick, he
was supposed to be the savior.

492
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,610
The answer to the Arizona
Cardinals organization.

493
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:24,880
Of course, that didn't work
out, so here he is in Miami now.

494
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,020
The pressure's really off.

495
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,980
He's got a new head coach here.

496
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,620
They're gonna be running
a New England system.

497
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,940
By the way, if you run the
New England offensive system,

498
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,530
you gotta be a smart guy.

499
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,930
That's what Josh Rosen is.

500
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:39,310
He's a smart guy, and I think
he's gonna fit in well there

501
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,180
and it's gonna be a place, by the way,

502
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,700
he also will have Fitzpatrick behind him,

503
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,270
who doesn't really seem
to have the attitude

504
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,020
of a starter that doesn't wanna help.

505
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,220
So you have two smart guys
in a quarterback room,

506
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,810
it seems like that's a much better place

507
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:52,259
for Josh Rosen to flourish.

508
00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:53,349
- Dianna, what about Kyler Murray?

509
00:18:53,349 --> 00:18:55,230
You don't think Arizona with Kyler Murray

510
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,970
has a chance to be a dynamic play maker

511
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,350
and five years from now, we're probably--

512
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,343
- That's really what
this question is right?

513
00:19:01,343 --> 00:19:03,880
It's an assessment of Kyler
Murray in a lot of ways.

514
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,930
- No, it definitely is,
again, the big question mark,

515
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:07,900
of course, is is it gonna
work with Kliff Kingsbury.

516
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,954
But to me, my biggest issue with Arizona,

517
00:19:09,954 --> 00:19:13,120
is last year and this year,
is their offensive line.

518
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,080
So as much as we can
say Kyler Murray can--

519
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,830
- I got five years to
fix it, in five years.

520
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,343
- That's right, he's looking
for a GM job right here.

521
00:19:19,343 --> 00:19:21,880
- No, I'm not!

522
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,386
You trying to get rid of me?

523
00:19:23,386 --> 00:19:24,496
We've got five years, I'm just--

524
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,350
- Breaking up is hard to do.

525
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,310
- You gave us five years, right?

526
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,189
- I gave you five years, I did.

527
00:19:28,189 --> 00:19:29,710
- That's a lot of drafts.
- Fair enough.

528

00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:52,720
I guarantee you, I meant it.

632
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,173
- Automobile 1920s, started the NFL.

633
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,410
Quit looking at my chest
hair look at the play.

634
00:24:02,287 --> 00:24:03,623
- Get them white legs up!

635
00:24:05,508 --> 00:24:08,175
(intense music)

636
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:14,310
- [Commentator] That
is JuJu Smith-Schuster.

637
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,603
Smith-Schuster past mid-field.

638
00:24:19,808 --> 00:24:22,975
A leaping grab by the man called JuJu.

639
00:24:23,978 --> 00:24:28,659
JuJu, JuJu Smith-Schuster
in the back of the end zone.

640
00:24:28,659 --> 00:24:29,800
Wow!

641
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,550
(upbeat music)

642
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,690
- We're joined this afternoon
by JuJu Smith-Schuster,

643
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:37,170
who's making his way all
the way across the Atlantic.

644
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:40,340
He is in London this
afternoon for the NFL academy

645
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,330
where he's an ambassador.

646
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:43,620
JuJu, tell us exactly what that is

647
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,493
and what it means there in London.

648
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,030
- So here in London,

649
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,560
we're working with the NFL academy,

650
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,130
which is an amazing thing
because they give the opportunity

651
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:56,893
to some players, young players,
from the age 15 and up,

652
00:24:56,893 --> 00:24:59,500
who learn the new game, American football.

653
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,530
This is new to them, which is awesome.

654
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,080
But it's awesome because
it just gives them

655
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,967
the opportunity that
they have another career,

656
00:25:04,967 --> 00:25:07,670
another goal that they can
set to play in the states,

657
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:09,180
to play in the NFL.

658
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,180
- JuJu, we talked to
James Conner yesterday.

659
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,810
He talked about turning the page,

660
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:15,690
about the changes that
had gone on in Pittsburgh

661
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:16,810
during the off-season.

662
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,620
What's the temperature of this team

663
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,370
as you get ready for training camp?

664
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:26,090
- We're at a 70, we're not
too cold or we're not too hot.

665
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:27,600
So the weather's really nice right now.

666
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,250
In our locker room,
everyone's on the same page.

667
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,630
Focused on the same goal.

668
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,388
Which is amazing because
that's what we're all about.

669
00:25:33,388 --> 00:25:35,600
We're all about the team,
there's no individuals.

670
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,610
And we're here to win games
and win championships.

671
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:39,140
- [Victor] JuJu, talk to
me about some of the talent

672
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,540
you're seeing out there
in London behind you.

673
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,590
Any ballers out there?

674
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,490
Any future Steelers out there or what?

675
00:25:45,229 --> 00:25:48,380
- Oh man, there's some talent
out here, some potential.

676
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,670
You gotta understand,
this game is new to them.

677
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:52,840
We started lifting weights
at 14, these guys are barely

678
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,370
starting at 16 or 17.

679
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:57,570
So if we were to get
them on the right page,

680
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:59,150
onto the academy, it would be amazing

681
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:00,910
to start a Pop Warner team,

682
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:03,550
eventually start through
middle school, high school,

683
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,770
and that would be their academy.

684
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:08,100
- All right, JuJu, it's
been well documented

685
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,970
that Antonio Brown's no
longer with the Steelers.

686
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:11,770
Now you're the number one guy.

687
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,040
How's it feel, do you feel a
difference in the locker room?

688
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,220
Are people treating you differently?

689
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,143
Are dudes getting your
trays of lunch for you?

690
00:26:17,143 --> 00:26:19,740
Is it a different feeling
being the number one guy?

691
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,573
How's it feel?

692
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,510
- Nah, man, there's no difference.

693
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:28,260
Obviously people say,
yo, you're the number one

694
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,987
guy this year, but more for myself,

695
00:26:29,987 --> 00:26:31,410
I just see more opportunity,

696
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:33,810
not just for myself but
for other guys to step up.

697
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:37,630
You talk about AB having 100
catches, over 1000 yards.

698
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,590
Those yards, those catches
are gonna be spread out

699
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,710
between our offense, between
James Conner, Vance McDonald,

700
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:44,510
James Washington, Dante
Moncrief, a lot of guys.

701
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,680
James Samuels, there's so many guys

702
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,680
who are getting more touches,
more catches, more yards,

703
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,350
more YAC, just to help them individually.

704
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,920
But at the end of the day,
I'm still the same dude

705
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,510
in the locker room, same
JuJu, the same person.

706
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,820
I'm just, last year I was 21 and this year

707
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,680
I'm 22, same thing.

708
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,513
- [Victor] That's what's up.

709
00:27:01,513 --> 00:27:04,210
- [Wendi] 22 year old version
of JuJu Smith-Schuster.

710
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:06,770
JuJu, you referenced the
football being spread around,

711
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:09,630
that makes the communication
with Ben Roethlisberger

712
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:11,050
all that more important.

713
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:13,650
What's your relationship
like with your quarterback?

714
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,570
- It's amazing, man.

715
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:20,133
Ben is a great leader, a great dude.

716
00:27:20,133 --> 00:27:23,350
He took the whole offensive group

717
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,430
down to his lake house in Georgia.

718
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:28,780
Amazing, we spent time together
bonding, we worked hard,

719
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,370
we threw, but at the end of the day,

720
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:32,830
it's more so building that
bonding and that connection.

721
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,450
What he did for us was amazing.

722
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:37,230
I think it's so crazy that a
guy who's been in the league

723
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:40,610
for 15, 16 years, he sees
so many guys come and go

724
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:43,490
and for me, I'm only 22 years old.

725
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:45,330
When I met him I was 20 years old

726
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:48,050
and our bond is just gonna keep growing.

727
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:50,730
- I know as a superstar
athlete that you are,

728
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:51,577
you're always working on something new,

729
00:27:51,577 --> 00:27:54,630
you're always working on something
new to perfect your game.

730
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:56,310
Gimme one thing you've been
working on this off-season

731
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:58,790
to just either get better at,
or something you wanna add

732
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,840
to your game or whatever the case may be.

733
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:05,610
- Man, I been really, really
focusing on playing more

734
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,330
inside and outside,
learning the whole package.

735
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:08,820
Learning the whole offense.

736
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:12,040
That's what separates being
on the field the whole game

737
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,670
and being on the field for
certain plays, certain packages.

738
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:16,090
I think it's great that I'm able to play

739
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:18,713
outside, inside, right side, left side.

740
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,120
Move me into slot, playing tight end.

741
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,220
That's gonna help out a lot.

742
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,410
That's something I've
really been focusing on.

743
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:27,750
It's studying that
playbook to the next level,

744
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:30,320
and understanding what
everybody has on the field.

745
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,530
- [Wendi] JuJu, we also get
to see everything else you do,

746
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:33,490
via social media.

747
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:36,493
Does anybody in the NFL
have more fun than you do?

748
00:28:39,546 --> 00:28:44,164
- Uh, not necessarily, I do
a lot of stuff for YouTube,

749
00:28:44,164 --> 00:28:46,010
there's a lot of stuff I do on that end.

750
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:48,913
I really love to show my personal side,

751
00:28:48,913 --> 00:28:51,910
my fun side, what I do in my free time.

752
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,930
Playing Fortnite, do a lot of video games,

753
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:55,950
streaming, Twitch, and
making YouTube videos.

754
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:58,680
I think a lot of guys in the NFL,

755
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,053
they just post a lot
of working out videos.

756
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,700
Which, there's nothing
wrong with that, you know.

757
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,033
But what do they like to
do on their free time?

758
00:29:05,033 --> 00:29:06,690
Do they like to travel the world?

759
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:08,980
Do they like to just stay
at home and watch movies?

760
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,767
I think a lot of their
fans would love to see that

761
00:29:10,767 --> 00:29:12,600
and just get on a more personal base.

762
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,450
- Well, and some like
to go to prom, you know?

763
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:17,510
Which apparently you did recently.

764
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:18,923
Tell us about the prom.

765
00:29:21,032 --> 00:29:24,620
- So the prom was awesome, a
kid, he's from PA, Pittsburgh.

766
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,830
Ideally he wanted to take this girl,

767
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:30,490
the girl that he liked a
lot, and his best friend

768
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:31,600
ends up taking her.

769
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,560
He told his best friend, too,

770
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,900
but his best friend kinda
went behind his back,

771
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,733
took his girl.

772
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:38,440
So he asked me and I'm just like man,

773
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,840
let's just one up this kid.

774
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,630
We buy a suit, we get a party bus.

775
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:46,593
We basically stole the night
away from him and his girl.

776
00:29:48,427 --> 00:29:50,730
At the end of the day,
we all had a good time.

777
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:52,730
I met the guy, he seems like a good kid.

778
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,610
He's great, my friend's
great cause he got like

779
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:58,630
20K followers, Anthony.

780
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:02,300
So he's super excited about
his college career coming soon.

781
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:06,250
- Yeah, Anthony, one, friends
and girl friend, nothing.

782
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,870
He wins.
- Exactly.

783
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:10,080
JuJu, we saw you getting
busy on the dance floor,

784
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,670
we saw you getting busy on
the dance floor right there,

785
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:14,140
talk to me about what
celebrations you got in store.

786
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,270
I know you're always being creative,

787
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:17,110
you always bring some
new stuff to the table.

788
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,710
What you got in store for us this year

789
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:20,310
from the celebration standpoint?

790
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,975
- Man, look, I'm super excited.

791
00:30:23,975 --> 00:30:27,210
Yes, I'm the young dude in
the room, but I'm very vocal.

792
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:29,200
It's my time to step up, to be a leader.

793
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,400
And what I mean by leader, I'm
getting everybody on the page

794
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,790
to do major celebration.

795
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,740
Like, Dante Moncrief, he's older than me

796
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,080
but he's gonna do these celebrations.

797
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,974
James Washington, all these
guys, all my receivers,

798
00:30:39,974 --> 00:30:40,970
we're gonna do major celebrations.

799
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:42,340
James Washington's on the same page

800
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,140
because we're in the same class.

801
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:47,140
And then you know, I'm
still working on Big Ben

802
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,480
and the old lineman,
they're a lot older than me,

803
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,182
so they're vets, they've
been there before.

804
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,740
We'll see how it all figures out,

805
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,640
but major celebrations coming soon.

806
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,050
- We can't wait, last question.

807
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:58,660
We asked James Conner this
yesterday to close things out,

808
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:01,470
why should Steeler fans be optimistic

809
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:03,533
as we look toward 2019?

810
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:09,730
- Man, Steeler fans are
always there supporting

811
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:12,660
since day one, whether
we're doing good or bad.

812
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:15,540
I don't doubt that they'll
support us till the end.

813
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,790
I'm kinda happy with
where we're at right now,

814
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,620
we're not the headline.

815
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,969
The Browns, they're the team
that everyone's watching,

816
00:31:21,969 --> 00:31:23,750
what kinda noise they're gonna make.

817
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,230
I'm super excited to watch them play, too.

818
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:29,320
See OBJ comment on my post,
and I'm commenting on his post.

819
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,700
Like yo, can't wait, who's
gonna have the best dance moves.

820
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,650
But like I said, this year,

821
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:35,180
the fans just support until the end,

822
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,380
because we're gonna finish strong.

823
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:38,370
You can always know the
Steelers pull through.

824
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:39,660
- [Wendi] All right, JuJu, best of luck.

825
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,010
We appreciate you being with us.

826
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,523
- [Victor] Thanks for being with us, Ju.

827
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,160
- Thank you, I appreciate it.

828
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:49,430
- With Antonio Brown
now departed to Oakland,

829
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:51,870
JuJu will become Big
Ben's number one option,

830
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:54,960
and with that he should
receive tighter coverage.

831
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,120
Over the last two seasons
when facing pressed coverage,

832
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,570
JuJu actually though
had a better catch rate

833
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:03,370
and yards per target than Antonio Brown.

834
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:04,253
Clearly,

835
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:07,780
Victor, perspective changes a little bit

836
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,940
I would think.

837
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:12,210
He's the number one guy,
he could say whatever.

838
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:14,760
What kinda pressure, how is it different

839
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,210
for JuJu starting this
season, than say, last year?

840
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:19,040
- I think the only thing
different is, like you said,

841
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,310
the mindset, the perspective.

842
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:22,020
Obviously you're coming
into that locker room

843
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,937
and Antonio Brown's not
there, it's just you.

844
00:32:23,937 --> 00:32:26,230
And now, you become that leader.

845
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,860
People are looking to
you, you've been there.

846
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:28,820
You understand who you are.

847
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:31,100
I know you're just, what'd
he say, 22 years old,

848
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,280
but now you become the guy
that the younger teammates

849
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,050
are looking up to you wanting
to know what you're doing,

850
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:38,490
wanting to hang out with
you in the off-season.

851
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:41,170
Wanting to just steal a little
bit of knowledge from you,

852
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:42,610
your relationship with Ben.

853
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:44,650
They wanna get a head start
on what they need to do

854
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:45,520
to get better.

855
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:50,070
And he becomes the guy that
leads the charge in that regard.

856
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,410
It's pretty big shoes to fill.

857
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:52,840
- I think the Steelers
have done a great job.

858
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,710
I think they were preparing
for this for a number of years.

859
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:58,350
There is that whole notion
of, we have to win for today

860
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,740
and develop for tomorrow.

861
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,560
You look at that position
in that organization,

862
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:06,010
going back to Mike
Wallace, Santonio Holmes,

863
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:08,300
obviously Antonio Brown, Smith-Schuster.

864
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,920
They do a great job of
getting guys in the pipeline,

865
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,890
getting them developed.

866
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:15,330
And now Antonio Brown moves
on, Smith-Schuster steps up

867
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:16,270
to be the number one guy.

868
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:18,720
I think they've done
a remarkably great job

869
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,413
for a number of years,
especially at this position.

870
00:33:20,413 --> 00:33:21,690
- I think that's a great point,

871
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:23,160
and I would argue that
outside of New England,

872
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,660
they probably do it as well as anybody,

873
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,660
in terms of continuity.

874
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:27,150
I know Antonio Brown ended in a way

875
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:28,630
they probably didn't anticipate,

876
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:31,120
but they did anticipate that
it would end at some point.

877
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,000
And to that end, Mike, and to your point,

878
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,130
they seem to be in lockstep
with planning for the future.

879
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:39,440
- I think there's three things
that JuJu Smith-Schuster

880
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,620
has to probably focus on this season.

881
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,390
It's going from being a great
receiver to an elite receiver.

882
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:46,670
He needs to play at that level.

883
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:48,640
Victor touched on the leadership aspect.

884
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,010
It's obvious Just from that interview,

885
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:51,500
you can hear he has stepped up

886
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,410
to already be that leader.

887
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:53,690
He's talking about trying to get

888
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:55,930
Big Ben and the offensive
line to participate

889
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:57,296
in the celebration drills.

890
00:33:57,296 --> 00:33:59,260
They obviously have good chemistry there.

891
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,910
And then that third
layer is being a mentor

892
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,160
to those younger guys.

893
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,960
So he's gonna be asked a lot more of him

894
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,822
as a football player out on the field,

895
00:34:07,822 --> 00:34:08,900
and then of course, in the locker room.

896
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,490
But if there's one thing,
I think, we've learned

897
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:14,670
about JuJu over the years
is he attacks everything

898
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:17,200
with open arms, he is
an open book himself.

899
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,760
He embraces that role, and he wants to be

900
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,370
that character guy, he
wants to be that good guy.

901
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:25,160
And when you talk to
players on the Steelers

902
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,530
about JuJu Smith and what
his personality is like,

903
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,820
because obviously on social
media he's so much fun

904
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,210
and he can be loud,
apparently he does a lot

905
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:33,460
of his work silently.

906
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,240
He's not the loudest guy in the room.

907
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,980
He's not the one joking
around during drills.

908
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,840
He likes to have fun, but
he's locked in and focused.

909
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:44,350
I think if he can take his
game to that elite level,

910
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:46,620
the Antonio Brown conversations
that we're gonna be having

911
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,355
are gonna feel so long ago.

912
00:34:48,355 --> 00:34:49,780
- You know what else he said
that was really impressive

913
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,150
in the interview, he touched on at the end

914
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:53,170
about the Steelers are
always there in the end.

915
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:54,880
And it's not where you start in football,

916
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,210
it's where you end.

917
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:57,690
And you look at Pittsburgh
and New England,

918
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:59,880
those teams always improve
during the course of the season.

919
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,670
So James Conner,
Smith-Schuster in a new role,

920
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:05,260
it's not what they look like
in August and September,

921
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,410
are they ascending and getting better.

922
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:09,160
And Mike Tomlin deserves so much credit.

923
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,500
The player development, the
way they coach their players,

924
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,510
they get better.

925
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,930
And I thought his point
was a good one which is

926
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:16,080
hey, we'll be there in the end

927
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,190
because that's where they've
been year in and year out.

928
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,990
- It almost feels like they transform

929
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:22,830
and they kinda morph into
whatever they need to be to win

930
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,510
towards the second half of the season,

931
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,140
and that's what keeps them in
the hunt year in and year out.

932
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,950
- Well, and I understand,
for all kinds of reasons

933
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:29,140
why everybody's looking to Cleveland.

934
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:31,650
But I think you'd be unwise
to sleep on Pittsburgh

935
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:32,850
in any way, shape, or form.

936
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:35,350
Mike Tomlin as the head
coach, a veteran squad,

937
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:36,900
this is a good team.

938
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,620
I think that you could

last season, we'll see.

What do Patrick Mahomes, Saquon Barkley,

941
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:44,650
and Kyler Murray all have in common?

942
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:48,130
They make head turning,
highlight reel worthy plays.

I have one question for you.

987
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,820
What size socks do you wear?

988
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,350
If you're like everyone else we've asked,

989
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:57,470
you simply don't know,

990
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:58,450
how could you?

991
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:01,410
All sock companies make their
socks in one size fits all

992
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:04,520
or just a couple of sizes
to fit every size foot.

993
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,690
At Kane 11, we make our socks

look at a few NFL players

1075
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:27,760
nominated for the ESPYS, shall we?

1076
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,380
After an impressive sophomore season,

1077
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:32,840
where he threw for over
5000 yards and 50 touchdowns

1078
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,330
and won an MVP for just that.

1079
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:39,880
Patrick Mahomes nominated
for best male athlete.

1080
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:44,400
Saquon Barkley nominated for
the best breakthrough athlete.

1081
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,410
Last season, Barkley burst onto the scene,

1082
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:49,490
rushing for 1307 yards.

1083
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:50,520
Broke a Giants rookie record.

Kyler Murray nominated
for best college athlete.

1085

He became the seventh
player to win the Heisman

1086
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,260
in OU's history.

1087
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:01,880
None of those are too shabby, right?

1088
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,750
But today we give out
the Highlight King award.

1089
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:06,210
Is that an ESPY, it's not.

1090
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:07,681
- It is not.
- It should be.

1091
00:42:07,681 --> 00:42:09,161
- But it should be.
- It should be.

1092
00:42:09,161 --> 00:42:09,994
- It definitely should be,

1093
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:12,270
but it's funny because my choice here

1094
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:14,650
is Kansas City quarterback
Patrick Mahomes.

1095
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:16,223
He is up for male athlete of the year.

1096
00:42:16,223 --> 00:42:17,323
- But you're crowning
him the highlight king.

1097
00:42:17,323 --> 00:42:19,670
- He gets my vote, and here's why.

1098
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,590
Against the Ravens, facing fourth and nine

1099
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:24,090
from the Chiefs 40, Mahomes just did what

1100
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:26,090
we had seen him do countless times,

1101
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:28,480
which was buy time with his feet.

1102
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,580
- [Mike] Get out of bounds.

1103
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,310
- [Dianna] Relies on his right hand there,

1104
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:33,560
finds Tyreek Hill down field.

1105
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,530
And the best part is after
the game, Andy Reed said,

1106
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:38,290
Oh yeah, that's exactly how we
designed it, yeah, sure Andy.

1107
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:39,963
How about against the Broncos?

1108
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:42,730
We knew his right hand was magical.

1109
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:44,070
Did you just say lucky?

1110
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:44,903
- [Mike] Lefty.

1111
00:42:44,903 --> 00:42:45,949
- Oh, I thought you
said lucky, I was like,

1112
00:42:45,949 --> 00:42:47,820
I don't think that was luck, Mike!

1113
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:49,740
We knew his right hand was pretty magical

1114
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,083
but his left hand here,

1115
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,061
spots Von Miller coming right at him.

1116
00:42:54,061 --> 00:42:55,300
- [Mike] Semi-spiral on that.

1117
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,970
- Even when your defense

1118
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:59,750
is doing everything they should be doing,

1119
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:02,940
there are situations where
you cannot beat Pat Mahomes

1120
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:06,760
because he comes up with some
unthinkable moments here.

1121
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:10,100
His athleticism, his vision of the field,

1122
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,870
and his ability to stay in
the pocket and make plays.

1123
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:15,580
And of course, outside
the pocket is where he's

1124
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:17,356
perhaps probably the most dangerous.

1125
00:43:17,356 --> 00:43:18,245
Victor is here.
- I'm going with

1126
00:43:18,245 --> 00:43:19,150
Saquon Barkley, here.

1127
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:20,610
- [Dianne] Oh wait, he's
your Highlight King.

1128
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:21,443
Just to be clear.

1129
00:43:21,443 --> 00:43:23,410
- He is my highlight king, Saquon Barkley,

1130
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:25,580
because he is a highlight machine.

1131
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:30,006
As you can see, he's broken at
least 47 tackles on that one

1132
00:43:30,006 --> 00:43:30,839
to get to the end zone.

1133
00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:32,740
And this one, I mean,
he's just putting his foot

1134
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:35,010
in the ground, he will not be
denied against Philadelphia.

1135
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:38,610
Obviously a rivalry in that division,

1136
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:39,840
and he's taking off on that one.

1137
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:43,217
In this one, this one's pretty good.

1138
00:43:43,217 --> 00:43:44,310
OK, we know this guy's good.

1139
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:46,360
First of all, tremendous
block by 73 right there,

1140
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:49,573
but this run is just indicative
of the type of athlete

1141
00:43:49,573 --> 00:43:50,990
that Saquon Barkley is.

1142
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:52,980
He can shake guys behind
him, in front of him,

1143
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:55,680
he's got the speed to outrun
anybody in this league.

1144
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,190
And that's what we see here
and it's always on display.

1145
00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:00,583
And then I get a bonus,
Dianna, I get a bonus one here.

1146
00:44:00,583 --> 00:44:02,301
Mike you'll like this
one, a nice little hurdle.

1147
00:44:02,301 --> 00:44:03,323
- [Dianna] Whoa!

1148
00:44:03,323 --> 00:44:04,921
- Plenty of running backs are doing that,

1149
00:44:04,921 --> 00:44:07,880
only a handful of guys, I
could probably count them all

1150
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,670
on one hand, who can hurdle
guys in traffic like that

1151
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:12,418
and keep it moving.

1152
00:44:12,418 --> 00:44:14,720
- Can you talk about that
mediocre protection, too?

1153
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,978
He was able to jump.

1154
00:44:15,978 --> 00:44:18,109
Not to pile on your
Giants, but the fact that

1155
00:44:18,109 --> 00:44:19,860
he was able to do that with
that O-line is incredible.

1156
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:20,693
- Got to do a lot on his own.
- All right, guys.

1157
00:44:20,693 --> 00:44:21,526
- [Wendi] Mike Tannenbaum.

1158
00:44:21,526 --> 00:44:23,440
- I got Kyler Murray, I was at this game.

1159
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,200
His resiliency was unbelievable.

1160
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,110
They got outplayed
badly in the first half.

1161
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:29,820
He comes out in the second half.

1162
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:31,993
He steps up in the pocket,
keeps his eyes down the field.

1163
00:44:31,993 --> 00:44:34,810
That puts so much pressure on a defense.

1164
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:38,050
Throws a really accurate
pass, this was a great play.

1165
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:39,830
Got Oklahoma back in the game.

1166
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:41,200
This was another game I was at,

1167
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,270
West Virginia's defense
was horrific in this game.

1168
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:46,250
If they were playing flag football,

1169
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:48,910
Kyler Murray still
would've gone untouched.

1170
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:49,960
- [Victor] Looks like flag football.

1171
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,360
- Yeah, I tell you what.

1172
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,040
And this is what Arizona's hoping for.

1173
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,510
Look at how many guys he
can make miss in space

1174
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:57,570
and have the speed to take it all the way.

1175
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:59,380
The amount of pressure
he'll put on defenses

1176
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:02,980
will be formidable in the
fall because it'll be his arm,

1177
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:03,813
and it'll be his feet.

1178
00:45:03,813 --> 00:45:05,198
Speaking of his arm, look at this one.

1179
00:45:05,198 --> 00:45:06,031
- [Victor] That was a dime.

1180
00:45:06,031 --> 00:45:07,730
- Oklahoma State, big rivalry game.

1181
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:09,980
Again, 50 yards down the field,

1182
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:11,840
hits Hollywood Brown in stride.

1183
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,670
This guy is gonna be a dynamic play maker.

1184
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:17,012
He is a highlight machine, he
is the highlight king maker,

1185
00:45:17,012 --> 00:45:18,800
and Arizona Cardinal fans,

1186
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,370
that's what they're looking
forward to in the fall.

1187
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:22,040
- They're hoping, fingers crossed.

1188
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,740
Listen, we told you we'd let you vote.

1189
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:26,300
We narrowed the field,
it's one of these three.

1190
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,760
Highlight King, OK?

1191

high school football.

1201
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:56,450
- He comes out, full head of hair

1202
00:45:56,450 --> 00:45:57,730
parted down the side.

1203
00:45:57,730 --> 00:46:01,103
I told her, there's
nothing ugly about him.

1204
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:05,093
He's still an angel.

- [Cable] At this time,

1330
00:51:13,583 --> 00:51:16,360
I just want to introduce to
you somebody that I think

1331
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,410
can really help turn this program around.

1332
00:51:21,103 --> 00:51:23,860
A coach that I hired
because I was impressed

1333
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:25,410
with his knowledge of the game.

1334
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:30,623
His passion as a coach blew me away.

1335
00:51:30,623 --> 00:51:32,760
(team chanting)

1336
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,520
Everything else that's on top of that,

1337
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,307
in terms of who he is and what he does

1338
00:51:36,307 --> 00:51:38,233
on a day to day basis inspires me.

1339
00:51:40,690 --> 00:51:43,292
Your new coach Rob Mendez.

(string music)

1342
00:51:56,464 --> 00:51:58,964
(piano music)

1343
00:52:10,529 --> 00:52:14,060
- It was awful, it was
really, really awful.

1344
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:16,199
I didn't have a choice to have an abortion

1345
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:21,199
so I had to keep Robert.

1346
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:25,713
- In the back of my mind, I'm
asking him why, why my son.

1347
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:30,600
Less than 100 born like him in the world.

1348
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:34,457
What am I gonna do with this boy?

1349
00:52:34,457 --> 00:52:37,960
- It was hard to see him, I
really didn't wanna see Robert.

1350
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:41,070
So I didn't see little
Robert for about two weeks

1351
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:43,763
because I just didn't know what to do.

1352
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:50,240
- I just remember staring,
there was a lot of staring.

1353
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,193
It would piss me off, really bad.

1354
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:56,483
Like he was not a human or something.

1355
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:03,140
- [Robert Sr.] But he was different.

1356
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:04,390
- I'm under arrest, yeah!

1357
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:11,670
- [Robert Sr.] He sees people
staring as an opportunity.

1358
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:14,867
- Hey everyone out there, you
know it's me, Robert Mendez.

1359
00:53:14,867 --> 00:53:17,560
(electric piano playing)

1360
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,690
- Things that you and I get to do

1361
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:23,190
in 10 minutes might take him an hour.

1362
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:24,840
But he never complained about it.

1363
00:53:25,683 --> 00:53:28,183
(piano music)

1364
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:32,250
- [Josie] Robert was
just a really easy child.

1365
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,525
- Again.

1366
00:53:33,525 --> 00:53:36,196
- And he just was really, really happy.

1367
00:53:36,196 --> 00:53:37,930
(group laughing)

1368
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:39,794
- [Jackie] What's your favorite team?

1369
00:53:39,794 --> 00:53:41,103
- San Francisco 49ers.

1370
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,890
- [Robert Sr.] He's got a
gift that doesn't require

1371
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:46,853
him to be physical.

1372
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:49,053
Making him aware of that,

1373
00:53:50,767 --> 00:53:53,015
I think he just took the ball and ran.

1374
00:53:53,015 --> 00:53:56,182
(inspirational music)

1375
00:54:01,428 --> 00:54:03,137
- I think the most difficult
part of having no arms

1376
00:54:03,137 --> 00:54:08,137
and no legs is simply not
being able to play sports.

1377
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:12,020
I don't show it, I'm
good at not showing it.

1378
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:14,499
But yeah, I get mad.

1379
00:54:14,499 --> 00:54:17,773
I get mad at God, I get
mad at the Lord, like why?

1380
00:54:18,701 --> 00:54:20,110
(calm music)

1381
00:54:20,110 --> 00:54:21,880
- His freshman year,

1382
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:24,120
he was standing behind
the fence at a distance

1383
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:25,270
watching them practice.

1384
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:27,870
That was the beginning.

1385
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:30,860
- We wanted to get him
involved in the program,

1386
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:33,513
so we invited him to be our manager.

1387
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:35,930
- They didn't know what I could do,

1388
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:37,170
they obviously knew I couldn't play,

1389
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:39,990
but just to include me, it
made me feel a part of it.

1390
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:43,143
It made me feel, I guess
you can say, normal.

1391
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:47,340
- He paid attention to us, as coaches,

1392
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:50,570
but he learned the game
playing Madden football.

1393
00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:52,650
He created game plans on Madden,

1394
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:55,250
and then he'd come to
practice and try to create

1395
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:58,630
the same game plans and
execute them the same way.

1396
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:00,720
- I started giving Robert a
little bit more responsibility

1397
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:01,740
with my quarterbacks.

1398
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:02,573
(whistle blowing)

1399
00:55:02,573 --> 00:55:03,481
- [Robert] Eyes on the quarterback, guys.

1400
00:55:03,481 --> 00:55:05,090
Eyes on the quarterback,
eyes on the quarterback,

1401
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:05,950
- And the next thing you know,

1402
00:55:05,950 --> 00:55:07,388
he was there running the drills for us.

1403
00:55:07,388 --> 00:55:08,450
- Go, go, go, go, go.

1404
00:55:08,450 --> 00:55:12,430
Saddleball, when you roll
out, big eyes, big eyes, OK?

1405
00:55:12,430 --> 00:55:14,267
- His ability to study the game

1406
00:55:14,267 --> 00:55:15,640
and his ability to translate those things

1407
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:18,609
to the kids is unmatched by
most of the coaches that I know.

1408
00:55:18,609 --> 00:55:20,040
- Right in front of the line,
right in front of the line.

1409
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:23,840
Ram over, W orbit, 46 power.

1410
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:24,972
- Let's go!

1411
00:55:24,972 --> 00:55:26,746
- Good job, good job!

1412
00:55:26,746 --> 00:55:28,829
Look it up, be ourselves.

1413
00:55:29,713 --> 00:55:33,370
I've been overlooked the
last three or four years

1414
00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:34,520
I've been ready for it.

1415
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:44,500
When I go to a job interview,

1416
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:46,223
sometimes I feel like I'm gonna,

1417
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:49,103
scaring is not the right word,

1418
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:51,490
surprise them.

1419
00:55:51,490 --> 00:55:54,700
And I don't know how they're
gonna take the surprise.

1420
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:57,270
- As he rolls out, to be brutally honest,

1421
00:55:57,270 --> 00:56:00,070
when I first saw that, I'm
like, how can this guy coach?

1422
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:02,510
And as he comes close, he goes,

1423
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:04,720
gimme a fist pump, gimme a fist pump!

1424
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,050
I just gave him a little
fist pump right there

1425
00:56:06,050 --> 00:56:06,960
on his shoulder.

1426
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,750
And all that nerves that I
had was just melted away.

1427
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:13,770
We had other applicants,
but I knew in my heart

1428
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:16,882
that it would be a great fit
for these young athletes.

1429
00:56:16,882 --> 00:56:18,570
(soft piano music)

1430
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:20,460
- I remember when Coach Cable hired me.

1431
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,460
Cruising off the campus I was like, yes!

1432
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:25,590
I just felt really accomplished.

1433
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:28,670
Because it took me so long,
I knew I'd been ready for it

1434
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:31,660
and I'd been overlooked,
and finally somebody gave me

1435
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:33,910
the opportunity so I
really appreciated that.

1436
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:39,690
- At this time, I just
wanna introduce to you

1437
00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:42,949
your new JV head coach, Rob Mendez.

1438
00:56:42,949 --> 00:56:46,130
(team clapping)

1439
00:56:46,130 --> 00:56:48,380
- Appreciate it, thanks Coach Cable.

1440
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:49,680
Thank you, Coach.

1441
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:50,890
You know, football is my passion.

1442
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:52,600
This is gonna be my 13th year coaching.

1443
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:55,580
I can't wait to get to know
every single one of you.

1444
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:58,820
Believe in yourself,
believe in your teammates,

1445
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:01,140
and believe in what you're doing.

1446
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:02,310
Are we clear gentleman?

1447
00:57:02,310 --> 00:57:03,270
- Yes, sir.

1448
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:04,848
- All right, I'm excited guys.

1449
00:57:04,848 --> 00:57:07,353
(team clapping)

1450
00:57:07,353 --> 00:57:10,810
(soft piano music)

1451
00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:13,200
- Obviously, it was a little shocking.

1452
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,850
And there was jokes going around.

1453
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:19,440
Typical teenagers, you know,
a guy with no arms or legs,

1454
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,190
not a lot of people have seen that.

1455
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,447
- If you're taken back,
that's just natural

1456
00:57:24,447 --> 00:57:26,120
and that's human.

1457
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:31,110
But after the first two
seconds, it's just a normal guy.

1458
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:32,630
- I don't care how good you are!

1459
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:34,560
I don't care how experienced you are!

1460
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:36,850
You guys are gonna do
everything as a team!

1461
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:38,600
- Though he may not look like a coach,

1462
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:40,420
he definitely acts like one.

1463
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:42,620
- Lax nine, 157!

1464
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:47,130
So what we're gonna teach
right now is called 31 zone.

1465
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,000
- His knowledge of the game
for somebody who hasn't

1466
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,350
actually gone through it is impressive.

1467
00:57:52,350 --> 00:57:54,150
On his phone, he could diagram a play

1468
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:56,150
faster than I can do with pen and paper.

1469
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:59,013
- There's definitely doubters
out there, like parents.

1470
00:57:59,013 --> 00:58:01,760
My God, my son is getting
coached at quarterback

1471
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:04,040
from a guy that has no arms and no legs.

1472
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:06,110
One, two, plant, good.

1473
00:58:06,110 --> 00:58:07,550
That lights a fire under my butt

1474
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:10,250
and probably gets me excited
to really just try to

1475
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:11,630
prove people wrong about it.

1476
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:14,580
Perfect, perfect, good job!

1477
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:18,970
- When they see him and
witness him and hear him,

1478
00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:21,180
I'd like to believe
that they take a moment

1479
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:24,120
to evaluate themselves,
and anything that they've

1480
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:27,510
gone through in life
can't be more difficult

1481
00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:30,000
than what he endures on a daily basis.

1482
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,370
- One thing that I care
about more than anything

1483
00:58:32,370 --> 00:58:33,670
is being a family!

1484
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:36,980
That is one thing I take
pride on, I love people!

1485
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:39,120
I love you, I love you,
I love you, I love you,

1486
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:40,420
I love everyone!

1487
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:43,150
So if you guys can't show
love on this football field,

1488
00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:44,650
then you better get off of it!

1489
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:52,338
Towards you, Aiden, who am I gonna go to?

1490
00:58:52,338 --> 00:58:54,588
(grunting)

1491
00:58:57,049 --> 00:58:59,630
Whistle, whistle,
whistle, whistle, whistle.

1492
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:00,500
If this was a game--

1493
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,930
It was a fractured orbital bone,

1494
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:05,583
and my cheek bone is fractured as well.

1495
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:10,453
Couldn't sleep, I couldn't chew.

1496
00:59:12,170 --> 00:59:13,553
- I just felt bad for him.

1497
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:17,870
You know, he's got a hard
life and I try to make it

1498
00:59:17,870 --> 00:59:19,782
as easy as I can.

1499
00:59:19,782 --> 00:59:21,370
(brushing teeth)

1500
00:59:21,370 --> 00:59:23,490
Things that you and I take for granted,

1501
00:59:23,490 --> 00:59:28,400
like brushing your teeth
or washing your face

1502
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,802
or taking a shower or
going to the restroom.

1503
00:59:30,802 --> 00:59:32,890
(electric razor buzzing)

1504
00:59:32,890 --> 00:59:35,117
Robert needs someone to help him.

1505
00:59:36,352 --> 00:59:39,352
(soft piano music)

1506
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:01,723
But he's tough.

1507
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:05,130
Two days later he was at his practice.

1508
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:07,093
- Hey Chuck, widen out,
widen out, widen out,

1509
01:00:07,093 --> 01:00:07,926
both of you!

1510
01:00:07,926 --> 01:00:10,680
- And his thing is, now, I
gotta be there for the kids.

1511
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:13,770
- Go to the flat, go to
the flat, go to the flat.

1512
01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:15,270
- [Michael] He's been
waiting to be a head coach

1513
01:00:15,270 --> 01:00:16,433
for a long time.

1514
01:00:21,373 --> 01:00:22,328
- I didn't want to let them down.

1515
01:00:22,328 --> 01:00:23,833
I didn't want to let the kids down.

1516
01:00:26,678 --> 01:00:28,278
I just can't stay away, I guess.

1517
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:34,620
Me being challenged
has been my motivation.

1518
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:36,802
All I gotta say is who says I can't?

1519
01:00:36,802 --> 01:00:37,720
- [Team] Nobody!

1520
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:38,553
- Who says I can't?

1521
01:00:38,553 --> 01:00:39,663
- Nobody!

1522
01:00:39,663 --> 01:00:40,780
- [Rob] Who says I can't?

1523
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:41,990
- Nobody!

1524
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:44,450
- Who says I can't
originally came from me,

1525
01:00:44,450 --> 01:00:46,910
just having a drive to accomplish

1526
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:48,855
whatever people doubted me for.

1527
01:00:48,855 --> 01:00:49,688
- Who says I can't?

1528
01:00:49,688 --> 01:00:50,521
- [Team] Nobody!

1529
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:51,354
- Who says I can't?

1530
01:00:51,354 --> 01:00:52,187
- [Team] Nobody!

1531
01:00:52,187 --> 01:00:53,020
- Who says I can't?

1532
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:53,853
- [Team] Nobody!

1533
01:00:53,853 --> 01:00:54,686
- Who says I can't?

1534
01:00:54,686 --> 01:00:55,519
- [Team] Nobody!

1535
01:00:55,519 --> 01:00:56,352
- Who says I can't?

1536
01:00:56,352 --> 01:00:57,185
- [Team] Nobody!

1537
01:00:57,185 --> 01:00:58,018
- Yeah!

1538
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:00,960
(string music)

1539
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,440
- If he's willing to do all of that,

1540
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,061
then what are we willing to do?

1541
01:01:05,061 --> 01:01:07,728
(team chanting)

1542
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:12,333
(crowd cheering)

1543
01:01:13,510 --> 01:01:16,240
- It's go time, we've been
working hard all summer long.

1544
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,000
Prospect on three, one, two, three.

1545
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:18,890
- Prospect!
- Prospect!

1546
01:01:18,890 --> 01:01:20,110
- Go kick ass, let's go.

1547
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:22,581
Let's go, run 638 stretch.

1548
01:01:22,581 --> 01:01:25,882
(cheering and shouting)

1549
01:01:25,882 --> 01:01:27,801
- [Announcer] Touchdown!

1550
01:01:27,801 --> 01:01:29,010
- That's how we do that,
that's how you do it.

1551
01:01:29,010 --> 01:01:29,930
Devon, let's go!

1552
01:01:29,930 --> 01:01:31,610
Those kids fought every single game.

1553
01:01:31,610 --> 01:01:33,600
I can't remember one
game that we were bigger

1554
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:36,150
than the other team, but
dammit, we got the job done.

1555
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:38,655
Oh, yeah, that's what I'm talking about!

1556
01:01:38,655 --> 01:01:40,831
That's what I'm talking about!

1557
01:01:40,831 --> 01:01:43,203
We got the momentum, keep it up, let's go!

1558
01:01:44,776 --> 01:01:47,526
(intense music)

1559
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,630
- The JV team in the last 10 years

1560
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:55,960
has had mostly losing seasons.

1561
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:58,890
He just really has done a
job that I haven't been able

1562
01:01:58,890 --> 01:02:01,740
to see other coaches do

Yeah!

Give me a hug, both of you
guys, good job you guys.

1569
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:17,571

morning and hello, Prospect.

1576
01:02:27,247 --> 01:02:28,793
Ann Sobrato High.

1577
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:33,051
Winner today wins the league.

1578
01:02:33,051 --> 01:02:35,266

of every single one of you!

1585

and 14 for the Panthers.

1595
01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:30,350
Fourth down play, Jackson off to his left

1596

and it's incomplete.

1597
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:37,970
Sobrato gets the win and
takes the division title

1598
01:03:37,970 --> 01:03:39,970

1599

Come on, man.

1602

Family is the most important
thing, remember that, OK?

1603
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:52,430
That's what we built this
team off of, was family, OK?

1604
01:03:52,430 --> 01:03:55,004
We've got good days and bad days, man.

1605
01:03:55,004 --> 01:03:58,317
And today as a team, that's OK.

It's gonna hurt today.

1608
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:09,150
And that's OK if it hurts
because we cared a lot.

1609
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:11,743
Because we love this game of football.

1610
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:16,050
I really sincerely want
you guys to understand

1611
01:04:16,050 --> 01:04:18,193
how much I appreciate this.

1612
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:24,343
You guys have given me

1615
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:35,863
cause they see a man in a wheel chair.

1616
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:40,890

1617
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:43,633
perfect.

1618
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:46,690
- When we're pushing him off the field

1619
01:04:46,690 --> 01:04:51,690
after games, it makes me feel
proud to have him as my coach.

1620
01:04:52,170 --> 01:04:53,750
- [Rob] Let's go with that flood play.

1621
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:56,523
- These kids would follow
him no matter where he go.

1622
01:04:57,630 --> 01:05:00,635
You can actually see
the changes in the kids.

1624
01:05:02,794 --> 01:05:03,834

1625
01:05:03,834 --> 01:05:05,560
Can I get a hug, good game, brother.

1626
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:07,450
- You want the best for your children,

1627
01:05:07,450 --> 01:05:10,080
and I told him one time,
you know, there's not a lot

1628
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:11,330
of money in this, Robert.

1629
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:16,503
And he told me, not everybody
does what they do for money.

1630
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:19,583
He's right.

1631
01:05:22,125 --> 01:05:24,075
- It gave me the feeling of importance.

1632
01:05:25,610 --> 01:05:29,340
And I don't think they know
that and understand that.

1633
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:30,740
Maybe they will one day but,

1634
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:37,980
I love those kids and I'm
always gonna remember them.

1635
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:38,813
Yeah.

1636

in theaters July 12th.

- [Wendi] UFC 239, Saturday in Las Vegas.

champions defending their titles.

1779

That's starting at 10 eastern.

1783
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:11,653
Go to ESPNplus.com/PPV.

1784
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:16,060
JuJu Smith-Schuster
will enter training camp

1785
01:11:16,060 --> 01:11:18,990
as the Pittsburgh Steelers
number one wide receiver

1786
01:11:18,990 --> 01:11:21,470
for the first time in his career.

1787
01:11:21,470 --> 01:11:23,720
Here is Smith-Schuster from earlier today

1788
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:26,720
on what it's like, and the
expectations of stepping

1789
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:27,973
into that role.

1790
01:11:29,510 --> 01:11:30,490
- I mean, obviously people say,

1791
01:11:30,490 --> 01:11:32,400
Yo, you're the number one guy this year.

1792
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,660
But more for myself, man, I
just see it more opportunity,

1793
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:37,060
not just for myself but
for other guys to step up.

1794
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:40,870
You talk about AB having 100
catches, over 1000 yards.

1795
01:11:40,870 --> 01:11:43,040
Those yards, those catches
are gonna be spread out

1796
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:43,873
between our offense.

1797
01:11:43,873 --> 01:11:46,320
Between James Conner, Vance
McDonald, James Washington,

1798
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,950
Dante Moncrief, a lot
of guys, James Samuels.

1799
01:11:48,950 --> 01:11:50,810
There's so many guys who
are getting more touches,

1800
01:11:50,810 --> 01:11:53,270
more catches, more yards, more YAC,

1801
01:11:53,270 --> 01:11:55,240
just to help them individually.

1802
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:57,160
At the end of the day,
I'm still the same dude

1803
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:59,770
in the locker room, the
same JuJu, the same person.

1804
01:11:59,770 --> 01:12:03,890
I'm just, last year I was 21,
this year I'm 22, same thing.

1805
01:12:03,890 --> 01:12:06,520
- Yes, the older, wiser, more mature,

1806
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:09,290
22 year old JuJu Smith-Schuster.

1807
01:12:09,290 --> 01:12:11,447
With a good YAC reference,
always a good day.

1808
01:12:11,447 --> 01:12:12,280
- Always.

1809
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:13,113
- All right listen, this got us thinking,

1810
01:12:13,113 --> 01:12:15,860
obviously big shoes to fill
with Antonio Brown departed.

1811
01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:17,290
He's now an Oakland Raider.

1812
01:12:17,290 --> 01:12:20,170
So let's go one by one,
receptions, more or less.

1813
01:12:20,170 --> 01:12:21,680
Antonio or JuJu, Mike?

1814
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:23,330
- Yeah, JuJu just made
all my points for me.

1815
01:12:23,330 --> 01:12:25,140
They're gonna spread the
ball around in Pittsburgh,

1816
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:27,050
plus you have a head coach in Jon Gruden

1817
01:12:27,050 --> 01:12:28,180
who's the play caller.

1818
01:12:28,180 --> 01:12:31,020
They gave up a lot of
money and picks to get AB.

1819
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:33,010
AB will have more receptions.

1820
01:12:33,010 --> 01:12:33,890
- I do think Jon Gruden

1821
01:12:33,890 --> 01:12:35,930
motivated to get Antonio
Brown the football.

1822
01:12:35,930 --> 01:12:37,460
How about touchdowns, Dianna?

1823
01:12:37,460 --> 01:12:39,980
- Touchdowns, I'm gonna
go with AB as well.

1824
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:42,070
You know, you actually teed
me up perfectly there, Wendi,

1825
01:12:42,070 --> 01:12:45,560
because I think if there is
anyone that wants to make

1826
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:49,150
Antonio Brown work in Oakland,
cause they have to figure out

1827
01:12:49,150 --> 01:12:51,110
why they pay him all that
money, it's gonna be Jon Gruden.

1828
01:12:51,110 --> 01:12:55,010
So he's obviously calling all
the shots on offense here,

1829
01:12:55,010 --> 01:12:57,370
and in terms of wide
receivers in the game,

1830
01:12:57,370 --> 01:12:59,350
we can debate all day
long who is the best,

1831
01:12:59,350 --> 01:13:02,890
but we all know how special AB can be.

1832
01:13:02,890 --> 01:13:04,460
As soon as he can figure
out that chemistry

1833
01:13:04,460 --> 01:13:06,010
with Derek Carr, I think he's gonna have

1834
01:13:06,010 --> 01:13:07,011
more touchdowns than JuJu.

1835
01:13:07,011 --> 01:13:08,660
- All right, there's
receptions, there's touchdowns,

1836
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:11,110
and how about all purpose
yards, Victor Cruz?

1837
01:13:11,110 --> 01:13:12,210
- I'm gonna give JuJu some love here,

1838
01:13:12,210 --> 01:13:15,630
because clearly Mike and
Dianna have not given him

1839
01:13:15,630 --> 01:13:17,360
any love so far, but I'm going with yards.

1840
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:19,000
He's the bonafide number one guy now,

1841
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,190
which means in those pressure situations,

1842
01:13:21,190 --> 01:13:23,940
Ben will be looking to him to
be that number one receiver

1843
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:26,310
and get him the ball in
space, either on drag routes,

1844
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:28,490
deep routes, he can run
any route in the book.

1845
01:13:28,490 --> 01:13:29,500
And it's gonna be interesting to see

1846
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:31,720
just how they use him
as the number one guy.

1847
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:33,770
- Look, it's a team game
and all of those things

1848
01:13:33,770 --> 01:13:36,660
are what they are, but what
really matters, of course,

1849
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:39,530
you hope anyway, are the number of wins

1850
01:13:39,530 --> 01:13:40,770
from each of these teams.

1851
01:13:40,770 --> 01:13:42,280
We've got the Steelers,
we've got the Raiders.

1852
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:43,470
Who gets the edge here?

1853
01:13:43,470 --> 01:13:45,160
- Yeah, it's gonna be Pittsburgh.

1854
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:47,550
I think we're gonna see an
improvement with Oakland,

1855
01:13:47,550 --> 01:13:48,800
especially on offense.

1856
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,440
Josh Jacobs, Terrell Williams,

1857
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:53,810
obviously AB, another year
with Derek Carr and Jon Gruden,

1858
01:13:53,810 --> 01:13:56,300
really worry about defense
and rushing the passer.

1859
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:58,400
Obviously they lost
Khalil Mack a year ago.

1860
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,140
While they drafted Clenin Ferrell

1861
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:02,390
from Clemson in the first round,

1862
01:14:02,390 --> 01:14:03,917
it's gonna take a while
for him to get going

1863
01:14:03,917 --> 01:14:06,500
but I think they're gonna
be a work in progress

1864
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:08,330
in terms of how they are on defense.

1865
01:14:08,330 --> 01:14:10,820
I'm going with Mike
Tomlin and a very mature

1866
01:14:10,820 --> 01:14:12,405
Pittsburgh Steeler organization.

1867
01:14:12,405 --> 01:14:13,840
- I think that's a pretty good bet.

1868
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:16,242
How about celebrations,
is this even a question?

1869
01:14:16,242 --> 01:14:17,710
Well I guess, maybe.

1870
01:14:17,710 --> 01:14:18,850
- It's not a question at all.

1871
01:14:18,850 --> 01:14:20,970
I'm going with JuJu, mainly because

1872
01:14:20,970 --> 01:14:22,320
it doesn't even have to be him

1873
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:24,430
that has to score to do the celebrations.

1874
01:14:24,430 --> 01:14:25,400
- [Wendi] He's made that clear!

1875
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:27,610
- He's made that clear,
everybody's in on this thing.

1876
01:14:27,610 --> 01:14:29,940
So whether it's him or
whether it's Vance McDonald

1877
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:32,670
or whether it's any other
person on that team.

1878
01:14:32,670 --> 01:14:34,030
They're gonna be celebrating

1879
01:14:34,030 --> 01:14:35,820
and JuJu will be leading the way.

1880
01:14:35,820 --> 01:14:37,890
- [Wendi] And let me tell
you, if you did not see it,

1881
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:40,110
JuJu was with us about an hour ago

1882
01:14:40,110 --> 01:14:42,690
and he said that he is
working on Ben Roethlisberger

1883
01:14:42,690 --> 01:14:43,523
to get involved.

1884
01:14:43,523 --> 01:14:45,692
He has not committed, but he's trying.

1885
01:14:45,692 --> 01:14:46,710
- [Victor] We'll see him in there.

1886
01:14:46,710 --> 01:14:47,543
- We'll see about that.

1887
01:14:47,543 --> 01:14:48,376
- I like that you've become

1888
01:14:48,376 --> 01:14:50,280
the resident celebration expert for us.

1889
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:52,640
It's like anything celebration,
we have to go to Victor.

1890
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:54,332
- Here I am, taking a bow for you.

1891
01:14:54,332 --> 01:14:56,370
- We have one more
category, one more category.

1892
01:14:56,370 --> 01:14:57,800
How about we do the drama.

1893
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:59,440
- Uh oh.
- Ah, the drama.

1894
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:01,690
- Is it on there or no?

1895
01:15:01,690 --> 01:15:02,760
- Let's see here.

1896
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:03,593
- I guess not.

1897
01:15:03,593 --> 01:15:04,576
- All right,

1898
01:15:04,576 --> 01:15:06,006
pretend.
- We'll just show the drama.

1899
01:15:06,006 --> 01:15:09,070
Speaking of drama, I'm gonna
go with what history says

1900
01:15:09,070 --> 01:15:11,737
and I think it's gonna be
Antonio Brown on this one.

1901
01:15:11,737 --> 01:15:13,510
Stick with that thought.

1902
01:15:13,510 --> 01:15:16,530
I like the way JuJu
Smith-Schuster is maturing

1903
01:15:16,530 --> 01:15:19,680
into not just a mentor
to these younger players,

1904
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:21,430
but an actual leader on the Steelers team.

1905
01:15:21,430 --> 01:15:23,830
And for Antonio Brown, there are a lot

1906
01:15:23,830 --> 01:15:26,130
of personalities on this roster now.

1907
01:15:26,130 --> 01:15:29,080
Obviously we know Jon Gruden
is the focal point of this team

1908
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:32,470
no matter who's on it,
but I think there's going

1909
01:15:32,470 --> 01:15:33,850
to be points during the season

1910
01:15:33,850 --> 01:15:38,500
where the AB of Pittsburgh
will show it's face in Oakland.

1911
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:40,700
- You cannot tell, we will
not get through this season

1912
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:41,953
without him getting irked with Derek Carr.

1913
01:15:41,953 --> 01:15:43,990
There's no way.

1914
01:15:43,990 --> 01:15:45,650
- It takes one sailed ball and he's gonna

1915
01:15:45,650 --> 01:15:46,980
come back like, really, really?

1916
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:48,403
- Put some money on it.

1917
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:51,190
The ESPYS are right around the corner.

1918
01:15:51,190 --> 01:15:53,010
Who is getting your vote

1919
01:15:53,010 --> 01:15:56,330
for the best record breaking performance?

1920
01:15:56,330 --> 01:15:59,497
Come on here, you know
Drew Brees wants your vote.

1921
01:16:01,903 --> 01:16:02,842
(intense music)

1922
01:16:02,842 --> 01:16:04,583
- [Commentator] Drew Brees has done it.

1923
01:16:04,583 --> 01:16:07,110
NFL's all time leading passer.

1924
01:16:07,110 --> 01:16:08,423
- You can accomplish anything in life

1925
01:16:08,423 --> 01:16:10,703
if you're willing to work for it, right?

1926
01:16:10,703 --> 01:16:13,370
(intense music)

1927
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:18,940
- Remember that degree
you got in taxation?

1928
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:21,660
Of course you don't, because you didn't.

1929
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:23,890
Your job isn't understanding tax code,

1930
01:16:23,890 --> 01:16:27,920
it's understanding why that
will get him a body like that.

1931
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,270
Move!

1932
01:16:29,270 --> 01:16:30,500
That.

1933
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:33,180
Your job isn't doing hard work, here.

1934
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:37,720
It's making her do hard work,
and getting paid for it.

1935
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:39,140
- [Announcer] Snap and sort your expenses

1936
01:16:39,140 --> 01:16:41,740
to save over $4600 at tax time.

1937
01:16:41,740 --> 01:16:44,000
- Jodi, it's time to get yours.

1938
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,359
- [Announcer] QuickBooks, backing you.

1939
01:16:46,359 --> 01:16:47,192
(doorbell ringing)

1940
01:16:47,192 --> 01:16:48,317
- [Woman] It's open!

1941
01:16:48,317 --> 01:16:49,270
- Hi, this is amazing.

1942
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:52,036
- [Narrator] With moderate
to severe ulcerative colitis.

1943
01:16:52,036 --> 01:16:52,869
- Are you OK?

1944
01:16:52,869 --> 01:16:54,463
- [Narrator] Even when I was there,

1945
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:59,013
I never knew when my
symptoms would keep us apart.

1946
01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:03,750
So I talked to my doctor about Humira.

1947
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:06,750
I learned Humira can help
get, and keep UC under control

1948
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:09,130
when other medications
haven't worked well enough.

1949
01:17:09,130 --> 01:17:11,350
And it helps people
achieve control that lasts,

1950
01:17:11,350 --> 01:17:13,730
so you could experience
few or no symptoms.

1951
01:17:13,730 --> 01:17:15,170
- [Ad Announcer] Humira
can lower your ability

1952
01:17:15,170 --> 01:17:17,250
to fight infections,
including tuberculosis.

1953
01:17:17,250 --> 01:17:19,500
Serious, sometimes fatal,
infections and cancers,

1954
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:21,110
including lymphoma, have happened.

1955
01:17:21,110 --> 01:17:23,500
As have blood, liver, and
nervous system problems.

1956
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:25,260
Serious allergic reactions and new

1957
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:26,480
or worsening heart failure.

1958
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:28,660
Before treatment, get tested for TB.

1959
01:17:28,660 --> 01:17:30,280
Tell your doctor if you've been to areas

1960
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:32,050
where certain fungal
infections are common,

1961
01:17:32,050 --> 01:17:35,260
and if you've had TB, Hepatitis
B, are prone to infections,

1962
01:17:35,260 --> 01:17:37,090
or have flu-like symptoms or sores,

1963
01:17:37,090 --> 01:17:39,350
don't start Humira if
you have an infection.

1964
01:17:39,350 --> 01:17:41,170
- [Narrator] Be there for you and them.

1965
01:17:41,170 --> 01:17:43,430
Ask your gastroenterologist about Humira.

1966
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:46,650
With Humira, control is possible.

1967
01:17:46,650 --> 01:17:49,490
- [Announcer] How do you
gauge the greatness of an SUV?

1968
01:17:49,490 --> 01:17:53,570
Is it to carry cargo,
or to carry on a legacy?

1969
01:17:53,570 --> 01:17:57,860
Can show it's strength, or
it's sign of intelligence.

1970
01:17:57,860 --> 01:18:00,883
In crossing harsh terrain
or breaking new ground.

1979
01:18:18,593 --> 01:18:20,470
- I really wanted another dog.

1980
01:18:20,470 --> 01:18:22,460
He was worried about the money.

1981
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:23,293

pick, Dak Prescott.

1997

- [Dak] Trust me, I know
what it's like to be doubted.

1998
01:18:55,380 --> 01:18:56,740
- [Commentator] He's entirely too small.

1999
01:18:56,740 --> 01:18:58,420
He shouldn't even play quarterback.

2000
01:18:58,420 --> 01:19:01,222
- [Dak] Remember, though, doubt is a gift.

Murray is the best player

- [Dak] So what if they doubt you?

2006
01:19:09,410 --> 01:19:10,470
- [Draft Announcer] The Arizona Cardinals

2007

select Kyler Murray.

2008
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:13,930
- They doubted me, too.

2009
01:19:13,930 --> 01:19:15,535
Go get 'em, bro.

2010

old man Hennessy's window.

2014
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:26,950
I just threw the ball.

2015
01:19:26,950 --> 01:19:29,189
- This is really bad,
what are we gonna do?

2016
01:19:29,189 --> 01:19:30,360
- We?

2017
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:31,980
- [Boy] Go to the door
and ask for the ball back.

2018
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:32,950
- Are you serious?

2019
01:19:32,950 --> 01:19:34,500
- It's my ball, Murtlebeck.

2020
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:35,549
- I'm so dead.

2021
01:19:35,549 --> 01:19:36,530
- I'd run away.

2022

2024

01:19:56,537 --> 01:19:58,140
- Hi.

2032
01:19:58,140 --> 01:19:59,142
- Hi.

2033
01:19:59,142 --> 01:20:03,410
- Tell him it was an accident
and we can fix the window.

2034
01:20:04,392 --> 01:20:06,307
Come on, I'll come with you.

2035
01:20:08,670 --> 01:20:10,410
- [Announcer] Loyalty, pass it on.

2036
01:20:10,410 --> 01:20:12,380
- You go first.

2037
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:13,394
- [Announcer] A message
from The Foundation

2038
01:20:13,394 --> 01:20:14,793
for a Better Life.

2039
01:20:15,980 --> 01:20:16,850
- [Wendi] Next.

2040
01:20:16,850 --> 01:20:18,450
- [Commentator] Drew Brees finds himself

2041
01:20:18,450 --> 01:20:20,383
only 35 yards away.

2042
01:20:20,383 --> 01:20:24,580
- [Drew] It's about us, it's
about our strength, on one!

2043
01:20:24,580 --> 01:20:27,820
- [Commentator] Just Peyton
Manning left to pass.

2044
01:20:27,820 --> 01:20:29,350
- Blue 80, set.

2045
01:20:29,350 --> 01:20:31,900
- [Commentator] He starts
in shotgun, drops back.

2046
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:34,000
Looks to the far side, wide open!

2047
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,290
(crowd cheering)

2048
01:20:35,290 --> 01:20:39,160
and Smith, what a way to do it.

2049
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:41,374
- I love you, bro, I love you, bro.

2050
01:20:41,374 --> 01:20:43,053
- [Commentator] Drew Brees is the NFL's

2051
01:20:43,053 --> 01:20:45,708
all time leading passer.

2052
01:20:45,708 --> 01:20:48,439
- Hey boys, how about that, huh?

2053
01:20:48,439 --> 01:20:50,853
- [Commentator] There's only
one word that comes to mind.

2054
01:20:50,853 --> 01:20:51,686
Greatness.

2055
01:20:52,533 --> 01:20:54,380
(hip hop music)

2056
01:20:54,380 --> 01:20:56,140
- Well, we continue to
highlight some of the stars

2057
01:20:56,140 --> 01:20:58,810
around the NFL that earned
ESPY nominations this year.

2058
01:20:58,810 --> 01:21:02,450
The amazing moment from Drew
Brees is up for the ESPY

2059
01:21:02,450 --> 01:21:04,760
for best record breaking performance.

2060
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:06,490
Brees broke the NFL passing record

2061
01:21:06,490 --> 01:21:09,807
when he passed Peyton
Manning's mark of 71,940 yards.

2062
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:15,190
Victor, you made this point
yesterday, and it's true.

2063
01:21:15,190 --> 01:21:17,700
I think last year was his
best bet at winning the MVP.

2064
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:21,023
He just had this pesky
little Patrick Mahomes

2065
01:21:21,023 --> 01:21:24,080
who did things that just
didn't seem possible

2066
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:25,780
to keep Brees from winning that award.

2067
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:27,810
- Exactly, and then how do you amass such

2068
01:21:27,810 --> 01:21:29,770
a monumental record like this

2069
01:21:29,770 --> 01:21:32,020
on an illustrious career that he's had

2070
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:34,370
and not win the league MVP one time?

2071
01:21:34,370 --> 01:21:37,070
I mean, obviously Peyton
Manning won a couple of those,

2072
01:21:37,070 --> 01:21:39,560
Tom Brady, all those tremendous players.

2073
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:41,440
But he's gotta get it one time.

2074
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:43,100
He's putting numbers
up each and every year.

2075
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:45,080
I think there's years
that he kinda just goes

2076
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:46,820
under the radar out there in New Orleans

2077
01:21:46,820 --> 01:21:49,160
with those play makers
and everybody he's got.

2078
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:50,480
I think this is the year where he's like,

2079
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:52,380
you know, we'll put a
nice pretty little red bow

2080
01:21:52,380 --> 01:21:56,500
on this career and put an
NFL league MVP under my belt

2081
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:59,043
and get back to the big dance, hopefully

2082
01:21:59,043 --> 01:22:00,380
and keep things going.

2083
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:03,090
- So in fairness, he has
been a Superbowl MVP.

2084
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:06,120
Two time offensive player of the year.

2085
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:09,360
But the Hall of Fame quality quarterback

2086
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:11,120
that Drew Brees is, you
would like to see him go.

2087
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:12,900
Although, I know he'd take
another Lombardi trophy

2088
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:13,860
any day of the week.

2089
01:22:13,860 --> 01:22:15,470
- Now that, you can't dispute.

2090
01:22:15,470 --> 01:22:17,120
But at least give him one league MVP.

2091
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:17,990
He's earned it.

2092
01:22:17,990 --> 01:22:19,880
- We'll show you why, how about this.

2093
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:22,410
How about the best of
the best of Drew Brees.

2094
01:22:22,410 --> 01:22:23,390
- [Victor] This is vintage, right here.

2095
01:22:23,390 --> 01:22:26,410
- [Wendi] Yeah, vintage,
'04, he was at Georgia.

2096
01:22:26,410 --> 01:22:28,410
Play action, deep to Eric Parker,

2097
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:31,580
breaks a tackle for a 79 yard touch down.

2098
01:22:31,580 --> 01:22:33,390
- [Victor] I like it, showing
that arm off real early.

2099
01:22:33,390 --> 01:22:34,810
- [Wendi] Black and white there.

2100
01:22:34,810 --> 01:22:38,038
- [Victor] Real pixelated,
grainy, I love it.

2101
01:22:38,038 --> 01:22:38,871
- [Mike] Pixelated?

2102
01:22:38,871 --> 01:22:42,240
- [Wendi] There you go,
2014 against the Packers.

2103
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:47,240
Brees steps up, just lays this
one perfectly into the arms

2104
01:22:47,540 --> 01:22:48,563
of Brandon Cooks.

2105
01:22:48,563 --> 01:22:50,001
A 50 yard touchdown strike.

2106
01:22:50,001 --> 01:22:51,201
- [Victor] What a dime.

2107
01:22:51,201 --> 01:22:52,135
- [Mike] You know what else is great?

2108
01:22:52,135 --> 01:22:52,968
- [Wendi] That is a dime.

2109
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:53,820
- [Mike] He's stepping up in the pocket.

2110
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:55,250
A lot of times you see
younger quarterbacks

2111
01:22:55,250 --> 01:22:56,990
step up in the pocket
and just check it down.

2112
01:22:56,990 --> 01:22:59,340
He's stepping up in the
pocket and keeping his eyes

2113
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:01,380
down the field, puts so
much pressure on a defense.

2114
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:02,213
- [Victor] Teach tape.

2115
01:23:02,213 --> 01:23:04,100
- [Wendi] '06 against the Bengals.

2116
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:06,660
The handoff here, it's a flea flicker.

2117
01:23:06,660 --> 01:23:07,493
- [Victor] Love it.

2118
01:23:07,493 --> 01:23:09,330
- [Wendi] And then Joe Horn there,

2119
01:23:09,330 --> 01:23:12,940
between two defenders,
a 72 yard touchdown.

2120
01:23:12,940 --> 01:23:15,310
And it's that kinda arm that we see.

2121
01:23:15,310 --> 01:23:18,498
And that's Victor Cruz-esque right there.

2122
01:23:18,498 --> 01:23:20,640
- [Victor] I like it, Joey.

2123
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:22,420
- [Wendi] Moving now to the modern day--

2124
01:23:22,420 --> 01:23:23,550
- [Victor] I miss the cellphone Joey.

2125
01:23:23,550 --> 01:23:24,890
- [Wendi] Against the Panthers.

2126
01:23:24,890 --> 01:23:28,320
Brees here to Ted Ginn in the end zone.

2127
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:29,153
49 yards right there.

2128
01:23:29,153 --> 01:23:30,650
- [Victor] The consistency
that we're seeing here

2129
01:23:30,650 --> 01:23:32,260
is with, he's not even being touched.

2130
01:23:32,260 --> 01:23:34,280
There's barely even people around him

2131
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:36,040
while he's making these throws.

2132
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:37,763
That's indicative to the type
of team he's been around,

2133
01:23:37,763 --> 01:23:39,667
that offensive line
taking good care of him.

2134
01:23:39,667 --> 01:23:43,320
- [Wendi] '06 NFC
championship, Saints and Bears.

2135
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:46,250
Brees here to Reggie Bush.

2136
01:23:46,250 --> 01:23:47,340
- [Mike] That's a great example of

2137
01:23:47,340 --> 01:23:49,300
a really effective quarterback play.

2138
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:51,140
Sometimes you have to throw
it as hard as you can.

2139
01:23:51,140 --> 01:23:53,040
That was a great touch throw.

2140
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:55,400
He led the running back,
who takes it all the way,

2141
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:57,410
but what touch he has.

2142
01:23:57,410 --> 01:24:00,680
And that's such an underrated
aspect of playing quarterback.

2143
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:04,940
- [Wendi] Then 2016 against the Raiders.

2144
01:24:04,940 --> 01:24:09,800
The longest career pass, is this a 98?

2145
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:10,633
- [Victor] Yep.

2146
01:24:10,633 --> 01:24:11,648
- [Wendi] Oh, he's got the--

2147
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:13,163
I'm sure he wishes he was one yard back.

2148
01:24:13,163 --> 01:24:13,996
- [Wendi] Well he's got a
little yards after catch here.

2149
01:24:13,996 --> 01:24:15,810
To Brandin Cooks, an incredible career.

2150
01:24:15,810 --> 01:24:16,910
Certainly I think the Hall of Fame.

2151
01:24:16,910 --> 01:24:19,150
- [Victor] Gotta miss him on that one.

2152
01:24:19,150 --> 01:24:22,020
- And perhaps a future NFL MVP.

2153
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:25,130
You can vote on the ESPYS
right now at ESPYS.com.

2154
01:24:25,130 --> 01:24:27,490
Again, Brees up for record
breaking performance

2155
01:24:27,490 --> 01:24:28,610
along with three other moments

2156
01:24:28,610 --> 01:24:30,210
including Klay Thompson's record

2157
01:24:30,210 --> 01:24:33,653
for three pointers in a game with 14.

2158
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:35,800
All right, we gave you our opinion,

2159
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:38,151
but who are you crowning
the NFL Highlight King?

2160
01:24:38,151 --> 01:24:40,200
Is it Mahomes, Saquon, Kyler?

2161
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:43,743
Dennis Green let's us know
what's happening next.

2162
01:24:46,735 --> 01:24:48,581
- Now, if you wanna crown
'em, you crown their

2163
01:24:48,581 --> 01:24:50,417
(beeping)

2164
01:24:50,417 --> 01:24:52,520
but they are who we thought they were.

2165
01:24:53,704 --> 01:24:56,454
(intense music)

2166
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:04,220
- What's up, Marquise, this is Juice.

2167
01:25:04,220 --> 01:25:06,593
Listen, it's not about height.

2168
01:25:07,470 --> 01:25:09,290
It's about heart.

2169
01:25:09,290 --> 01:25:12,901
It breaks through walls
and outruns demons.

2170
01:25:12,901 --> 01:25:13,734
(crowd cheering)

2171
01:25:13,734 --> 01:25:14,567
- [Commentator] Show time!

2172
01:25:14,567 --> 01:25:15,933
- It outworks everybody.

2173
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:18,700
When they see that,

2174
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:19,717
they ain't gonna know what to do with you.

2175
01:25:19,717 --> 01:25:22,027
- [Commentator] Lights, camera, action.

2176
01:25:22,027 --> 01:25:24,883
- [Announcer] The Baltimore
Ravens select Marquise Brown.

2177
01:25:24,883 --> 01:25:26,552
- Bless 'em, my boy.

2178
01:25:26,552 --> 01:25:29,400
(intense music)

2179
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:30,760
- [Mother] Look, make a wish.

2180
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:32,550
- I wish for a Biggie Bag from Wendy's.

2181
01:25:32,550 --> 01:25:35,473
- I wish everyone loved
each other, and was all--

2182
01:25:35,473 --> 01:25:37,350
- That was a great wish, Jimmy.

2183
01:25:37,350 --> 01:25:38,640
- [Announcer] Get a bacon double stack

2184
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:39,940
