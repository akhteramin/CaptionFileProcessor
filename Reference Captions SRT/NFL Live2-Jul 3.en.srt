1
00:00:00,132 --> 00:00:03,467
- As far as the squad
itself, after the game,

2
00:00:03,467 --> 00:00:05,733
they posted a video of
most of the team dancing

3
00:00:05,733 --> 00:00:08,797
to the 2007 banger "Rock Yo Hips".

4
00:00:08,797 --> 00:00:10,741
If you don't know it, that sucks for you.

5
00:00:10,741 --> 00:00:12,350
But the fact that this song

6
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,325
is what brings this team
together is amazing.

7
00:00:15,325 --> 00:00:17,772
Oh, and the name of the group who made it,

8
00:00:17,772 --> 00:00:20,223
probably describes both
country's histories

9
00:00:20,223 --> 00:00:23,063
of money making quite well, Crime Mob.

10
00:00:23,063 --> 00:00:25,837
God bless them, and God bless America.

11
00:00:25,837 --> 00:00:26,876
NFL Live's next.

12
00:00:26,876 --> 00:00:28,458
We're back on July 11th.

13
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:30,625
I'm Clinton Yates, kiddos.

14
00:00:32,057 --> 00:00:33,555
Got it!

15
00:00:33,555 --> 00:00:36,305
(dramatic music)

16
00:00:45,828 --> 00:00:49,220
- NFL Live packed with
special guest stars today.

17
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,478
Jaguar's quarterback Jalen
Ramsey joins the show live

18
00:00:52,478 --> 00:00:56,285
to talk about how the Jags
bounced back this year.

19
00:00:56,285 --> 00:00:59,240
We'll also talk to Browns
tight end David Njoku

20
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,144
about all the excitement in Cleveland

21
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:04,309
and what's ahead for the Browns.

22
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:06,458
And since tomorrow is Independence Day,

23
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:09,729
we will show you some of
the best independent plays

24
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:10,855
in NFL history.

25
00:01:10,855 --> 00:01:13,132
You'll wanna stick around,
if only to find out

26
00:01:13,132 --> 00:01:14,882
what we mean by that.

27
00:01:16,185 --> 00:01:18,639
Oh yes, if you just can't
get your holiday weekend

28
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:21,239
started without hearing
90 more minutes of NFL

29
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:24,470
off-season content, you have
come to the right place.

30
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:27,786
Dan Graziano here with Damien
Woody and Mike Tannenbaum.

31
00:01:27,786 --> 00:01:29,611
Lots to get to on the eve

32
00:01:29,611 --> 00:01:31,925
of your long holiday
weekend, but we will start

33
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:36,165
with the situation
regarding Ezekiel Elliott.

34
00:01:36,165 --> 00:01:38,236
The Cowboys superstar
running back met Tuesday

35
00:01:38,236 --> 00:01:40,046
with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell

36
00:01:40,046 --> 00:01:42,889
to discuss a recent
incident involving Elliott

37
00:01:42,889 --> 00:01:44,906
and a security guard in Las Vegas.

38
00:01:44,906 --> 00:01:46,204
Elliott was briefly detained

39
00:01:46,204 --> 00:01:48,067
but not arrested in the incident.

40
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:50,235
Given his history with the
league's personal conduct

41
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:54,285
policy, the commissioner
called him in for a discussion.

42
00:01:54,285 --> 00:01:56,672
Following that discussion,
Elliott posted the following

43
00:01:56,672 --> 00:01:58,342
statement on Twitter.

44
00:01:58,342 --> 00:02:00,241
"Earlier today I met with the commissioner

45
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:02,197
"to share with him what
occurred in Las Vegas

46
00:02:02,197 --> 00:02:04,295
"and what I have learned
from that incident.

47
00:02:04,295 --> 00:02:05,835
"I've worked hard to make better decisions

48
00:02:05,835 --> 00:02:07,376
"and to live up to the high standards

49
00:02:07,376 --> 00:02:08,807
"that are expected of me.

50
00:02:08,807 --> 00:02:12,339
"I have failed to do that here,
and I made a poor decision.

51
00:02:12,339 --> 00:02:14,401
"I apologized to Kyle Johnson,"

52
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:15,974
that's the security guard in question,

53
00:02:15,974 --> 00:02:17,597
"at the time and I meant it.

54
00:02:17,597 --> 00:02:20,459
"I need to work harder to
ensure I do not put myself

55
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:23,239
"in compromised situations in the future.

56
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:25,856
"I am rededicating myself
to use all of the resources

57
00:02:25,856 --> 00:02:27,765
"that the league has made available.

58
00:02:27,765 --> 00:02:30,708
"But in the end, it is up to
me and I am determined not

59
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:34,094
"to be in this position again."

60
00:02:34,094 --> 00:02:35,048
Why is this a big deal?

61
00:02:35,048 --> 00:02:36,947
Well, partially because of the warning

62
00:02:36,947 --> 00:02:38,730
commissioner Roger
Goodell issued to Elliott

63
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,230
when he suspended him in 2017.

64
00:02:42,112 --> 00:02:43,891
In his suspension letter at that time

65
00:02:43,891 --> 00:02:45,234
Goodell wrote to Elliott,

66
00:02:45,234 --> 00:02:47,597
"You must have no further
adverse involvement

67
00:02:47,597 --> 00:02:49,417
"with law enforcement, and must not commit

68
00:02:49,417 --> 00:02:52,125
"any additional violations
of league policies.

69
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,055
"You should understand
that another violation

70
00:02:54,055 --> 00:02:56,135
"of this nature may
result in your suspension

71
00:02:56,135 --> 00:02:59,993
"or potential banishment from the NFL."

72
00:02:59,993 --> 00:03:02,226
So look, we are not here to make equations

73
00:03:02,226 --> 00:03:04,391
or comparisons between
things that Ezekiel Elliott

74
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:06,324
did in the past and
what this incident was,

75
00:03:06,324 --> 00:03:08,166
but here he is sort of making

76
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,442
the wrong kinds of headlines again.

77
00:03:10,442 --> 00:03:12,847
And being called into the
commissioner's office,

78
00:03:12,847 --> 00:03:14,886
no small thing for a
player in his situation.

79
00:03:14,886 --> 00:03:16,792
So Mike, if you're in the front office

80
00:03:16,792 --> 00:03:19,743
of this team, and you have
a player in this situation.

81
00:03:19,743 --> 00:03:22,184
He's got a contract situation coming up

82
00:03:22,184 --> 00:03:23,642
over the next couple years.

83
00:03:23,642 --> 00:03:25,506
What kind of conversation do you need

84
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:27,152
to have with him at this time?

85
00:03:27,152 --> 00:03:29,486
- Yeah you need to have a direct, honest,

86
00:03:29,486 --> 00:03:31,573
and very difficult conversation.

87
00:03:31,573 --> 00:03:33,802
You have to let him
know that this behavior

88
00:03:33,802 --> 00:03:37,339
is unacceptable and this
is more than one instance.

89
00:03:37,339 --> 00:03:39,833
And as you said, Dan, maybe
it's not as significant

90
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,955
as the one that happened in the past.

91
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:44,508
But from the Cowboys organization
what I would tell him is,

92
00:03:44,508 --> 00:03:48,337
"Look, we're gonna hit pause
on your contract negotiations."

93
00:03:48,337 --> 00:03:51,613
There's four other players
right now that the Cowboys have.

94
00:03:51,613 --> 00:03:53,662
Dak Prescott their starting quarterback,

95
00:03:53,662 --> 00:03:57,497
Amari Cooper, who they traded
for from the Oakland Raiders.

96
00:03:57,497 --> 00:03:59,643
And two good defensive
players in Jalen Smith

97
00:03:59,643 --> 00:04:00,620
and Byron Jones.

98
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,264
All four of those players
are going into the last year

99
00:04:03,264 --> 00:04:04,781
of their respective contracts.

100
00:04:04,781 --> 00:04:08,790
They have played well and
acted flawlessly off the field.

101
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,325
I would have that conversation
with Ezekiel Elliott to say,

102
00:04:11,325 --> 00:04:13,117
"While we appreciate what
you've done on the field,

103
00:04:13,117 --> 00:04:15,533
"right now you're under
contract for this year.

104
00:04:15,533 --> 00:04:17,634
"We have the option for 2020,

105
00:04:17,634 --> 00:04:20,810
"and we can franchise you the year after.

106
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:22,081
"So basically, for the next three years,

107
00:04:22,081 --> 00:04:24,050
"we can control your rights.

108
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,827
"And because of the way you've acted,

109
00:04:25,827 --> 00:04:28,948
"we're hitting pause and it may
not be what you wanna hear."

110
00:04:28,948 --> 00:04:30,228
But that's the conversation

111
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,567
you need to have with the player.

112
00:04:31,567 --> 00:04:33,955
- Damien, from the
standpoint of a teammate

113
00:04:33,955 --> 00:04:35,342
of a guy like this in this situation,

114
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:37,506
what conversation are you having with him?

115
00:04:37,506 --> 00:04:39,042
- Well listen, I think it's just important

116
00:04:39,042 --> 00:04:40,691
that you're available.

117
00:04:40,691 --> 00:04:43,768
Because for a veteran,
at the end of the day,

118
00:04:43,768 --> 00:04:47,128
if the guy who basically stirs
the drink isn't available,

119
00:04:47,128 --> 00:04:48,987
you're affecting my money.

120
00:04:48,987 --> 00:04:51,348
You're affecting everybody
in the organization.

121
00:04:51,348 --> 00:04:52,181
I mean, think about it.

122
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:54,603
Jason Garrett is, this is
like his contract year.

123
00:04:54,603 --> 00:04:57,220
This is his year, do or die year,

124
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,868
and you're putting yourself,
you're Ezekiel Elliott,

125
00:04:59,868 --> 00:05:01,807
you're putting yourself in
a compromising situation

126
00:05:01,807 --> 00:05:04,406
where you could be potentially suspended

127
00:05:04,406 --> 00:05:06,343
and not available to the team.

128
00:05:06,343 --> 00:05:09,657
There's so much riding on
the Dallas Cowboys this year

129
00:05:09,657 --> 00:05:11,182
that it's all hands on deck.

130
00:05:11,182 --> 00:05:13,535
And if I'm a veteran in
the locker room I'm like,

131
00:05:13,535 --> 00:05:16,868
"Dude, okay, let's chill out, calm down.

132
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:20,166
"You can't keep putting
yourself out there,

133
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,285
"because you're hurting
everybody, not just yourself."

134
00:05:22,285 --> 00:05:25,102
- And Damien, to your point
about how Ezekiel Elliott

135
00:05:25,102 --> 00:05:27,424
stirs the drink, look at Dak Prescott,

136
00:05:27,424 --> 00:05:31,932
he has some passer rating of
122 from when it's play action.

137
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:33,818
And the reason that's so effective is,

138
00:05:33,818 --> 00:05:36,527
the opposing defense is
worrying about Ezekiel Elliott.

139
00:05:36,527 --> 00:05:38,585
So, that is not by coincidence

140
00:05:38,585 --> 00:05:40,167
that he has such a high passer rating

141
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:42,440
from when they're in play action,

142
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,891
because everything's gonna
be keyed on Ezekiel Elliott.

143
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:48,144
So, if he's not available,
it does disrupt.

144
00:05:48,144 --> 00:05:50,831
Now look, Amari Cooper was
a very valuable acquisition,

145
00:05:50,831 --> 00:05:52,219
but without Ezekiel Elliott,

146
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:54,821
that offense is a lot easier to defend.

147
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:56,987
- So, no question obviously
about the importance

148
00:05:56,987 --> 00:05:58,986
of Ezekiel Elliott to
the Cowboys' offense.

149
00:05:58,986 --> 00:06:02,310
They struggled without him in
2017 when he was suspended.

150
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,423
We await word from the
commissioner's office

151
00:06:04,423 --> 00:06:07,022
on whether he will face discipline
for this latest incident

152
00:06:07,022 --> 00:06:09,103
and if that word comes in
the next hour and a half,

153
00:06:09,103 --> 00:06:11,294
we will of course bring it to you.

154
00:06:11,294 --> 00:06:13,001
In the meantime though,
we're gonna move on

155
00:06:13,001 --> 00:06:14,994
to the sillier portion of our show.

156
00:06:14,994 --> 00:06:16,206
(laughing)

157
00:06:16,206 --> 00:06:17,440
("The Stars and Stripes Forever")

158
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,650
Tomorrow is the 243rd anniversary

159
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:23,317
of the signing of the
Declaration of Independence.

160
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:25,210
We didn't have access to Thomas Jefferson,

161
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,568
we have Damien Woody and
we have Mike Tannenbaum,

162
00:06:27,568 --> 00:06:30,409
but even though they might
not have been the first choice

163
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:33,339
on declarations, Jefferson
couldn't make it.

164
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:37,617
We've decided to ask them of
some declarations of their own.

165
00:06:37,617 --> 00:06:40,631
So, basically what this is
going to be is something

166
00:06:40,631 --> 00:06:43,294
you feel strongly about,
something you feel like declaring

167
00:06:43,294 --> 00:06:45,328
about the upcoming NFL season.

168
00:06:45,328 --> 00:06:46,736
It doesn't have to be about life, liberty,

169
00:06:46,736 --> 00:06:47,777
or the pursuit of happiness.

170
00:06:47,777 --> 00:06:49,296
It has to be about football.

171
00:06:49,296 --> 00:06:50,702
Damien, start with you.

172
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:53,544
What's your first declaration of the day?

173
00:06:53,544 --> 00:06:55,928
- So, my declaration is that Kirk Cousins

174
00:06:55,928 --> 00:06:59,589
will be the best quarterback
in the NFC North this year.

175
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:00,784
- Whoa, whoa.
- Yes.

176
00:07:00,784 --> 00:07:03,576
I'm going out there on Kirk Cousins

177
00:07:03,576 --> 00:07:04,897
and the Minnesota Vikings.

178
00:07:04,897 --> 00:07:07,044
I love what the Vikings did in the draft,

179
00:07:07,044 --> 00:07:09,314
adding a couple pieces up
front on the offensive line.

180
00:07:09,314 --> 00:07:11,661
They have arguably the
best wide receiver tandem

181
00:07:11,661 --> 00:07:15,415
in Thielen, and in Diggs on the outside.

182
00:07:15,415 --> 00:07:17,823
They drafted Irv Smith, you know,

183
00:07:17,823 --> 00:07:21,369
tight end from Alabama to
go along with Kyle Rudolph.

184
00:07:21,369 --> 00:07:23,434
And obviously Dalvin
Cook in the backfield.

185
00:07:23,434 --> 00:07:26,997
So everything right now is ready-made.

186
00:07:26,997 --> 00:07:29,315
Mike T. is trying to jump in on this,

187
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:30,941
but I'm not gonna let him jump in.

188
00:07:30,941 --> 00:07:33,569
I am adamant right now that Kirk Cousins

189
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:36,916
is gonna get it done in
the NFC North this year.

190
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,524
Don't make me look like
a fool, Kirk Cousins.

191
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:41,283
- Yeah, we're gonna have an
NFL constitutional crisis

192
00:07:41,283 --> 00:07:42,728
because, let me tell ya.
(laughing)

193
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:45,334
I got the words Aaron Rodgers.
(laughing)

194
00:07:45,334 --> 00:07:47,567
- Listen, I understand Aaron
Rodgers is in the NFC North

195
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:50,500
and I got much love and
respect for Aaron Rodgers,

196
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,263
but I also look at this.

197
00:07:53,263 --> 00:07:57,145
What did the Green Bay
Packers, how much addition

198
00:07:57,145 --> 00:07:59,948
did the Green Bay Packers
add to Aaron Rodgers,

199
00:07:59,948 --> 00:08:02,094
you know that offense,
to help Aaron Rodgers

200
00:08:02,094 --> 00:08:03,499
this upcoming year?

201
00:08:03,499 --> 00:08:04,489
Not much.

202
00:08:04,489 --> 00:08:06,474
I didn't see much of anything this year.

203
00:08:06,474 --> 00:08:08,255
- Guys to develop.
- Like I said,

204
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:11,172
with Kirk Cousins this is the year.

205
00:08:12,338 --> 00:08:14,072
He's getting paid a boatload of money.

206
00:08:14,072 --> 00:08:16,949
The Minnesota Vikings
drafted guys up front

207
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:18,714
to help on their offensive line,

208
00:08:18,714 --> 00:08:21,508
and I think this is the
year that Kirk Cousins

209
00:08:21,508 --> 00:08:25,296
makes a statement in the
National Football League.

210
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,767
- So if he does, what does
that mean for the Vikings?

211
00:08:27,767 --> 00:08:29,577
How far can they take it?

212
00:08:29,577 --> 00:08:30,941
- They can go to the Super Bowl.

213
00:08:30,941 --> 00:08:31,774
- Oh, boy.

214
00:08:31,774 --> 00:08:33,114
Vikings.
- If you have--

215
00:08:33,114 --> 00:08:34,849
- This is how we do declarations.

216
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:37,873
- If you haven't figured it out by now,

217
00:08:37,873 --> 00:08:40,966
I'm pretty bullish on
the Minnesota Vikings.

218
00:08:40,966 --> 00:08:43,941
- But Damien, we know
the sign of great players

219
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:45,459
when they make everybody
else around them better.

220
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:48,056
Isn't that one of Aaron
Rodgers's greatest strengths,

221
00:08:48,056 --> 00:08:50,419
is that he could elevate
the play of his teammates?

222
00:08:50,419 --> 00:08:52,361
And I agree, Minnesota's
had a good offseason,

223
00:08:52,361 --> 00:08:53,554
Dalvin Cook's coming back.

224
00:08:53,554 --> 00:08:55,491
But at the end of the
day, isn't Aaron Rodgers

225
00:08:55,491 --> 00:08:58,043
the better player than Kirk Cousins?

226
00:08:58,043 --> 00:09:00,023
- Yeah, Cousins had the
highest completion percentage

227
00:09:00,023 --> 00:09:02,203
of any NFC North quarterback last year

228
00:09:02,203 --> 00:09:03,036
and the most touchdown passes.

229
00:09:03,036 --> 00:09:04,470
But as he would tell you,

230
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:08,431
he was only 1-6-1 against
teams with winning records.

231
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:09,711
Obviously you gotta do better than that.

232
00:09:09,711 --> 00:09:12,011
Mike, what do you got to compete with that

233
00:09:12,011 --> 00:09:13,589
Damien Woody declaration?

234
00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:16,025
- Well, I will stay
with the same position.

235
00:09:16,025 --> 00:09:17,593
(laughing)

236
00:09:17,593 --> 00:09:19,586
And I'm going to declare that Kyler Murray

237
00:09:19,586 --> 00:09:21,358
will not play in 16 games

238
00:09:21,358 --> 00:09:23,134
And my concern for Kyler Murray

239
00:09:23,134 --> 00:09:25,453
is his play style is
very similar to someone

240
00:09:25,453 --> 00:09:26,775
like Marcus Mariota.

241
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:29,528
Marcus Mariota, throughout
his career has never

242
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:30,788
played in 16 games.

243
00:09:30,788 --> 00:09:33,292
And while Kyler Murray
is a dynamic athlete,

244
00:09:33,292 --> 00:09:35,925
because of his build,
I think at some point

245
00:09:35,925 --> 00:09:38,178
it's gonna be hard for
him to answer the bell

246
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:40,348
at some Sunday this season.

247
00:09:40,348 --> 00:09:41,999
And I could see him
missing at least one game.

248
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:44,431
So my declaration is, Kyler Murray,

249
00:09:44,431 --> 00:09:47,547
based on his size, based
on the way he plays,

250
00:09:47,547 --> 00:09:48,948
he will not play in 16 games.

251
00:09:48,948 --> 00:09:50,268
- Very interesting,
because a lot of excitement

252
00:09:50,268 --> 00:09:52,624
about Kyler Murray and that
Kliff Kingsbury offense

253
00:09:52,624 --> 00:09:54,306
there in Arizona the first year.

254
00:09:54,306 --> 00:09:55,586
But he is a scrambler.

255
00:09:55,586 --> 00:09:57,163
He scrambled 41 times last year,

256
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:59,354
ninth most of any FBS quarterback.

257
00:09:59,354 --> 00:10:01,539
That's certainly going
to be part of his game.

258
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:04,224
They say that that helps
when they are questions

259
00:10:04,224 --> 00:10:05,548
on the offensive line.

260
00:10:05,548 --> 00:10:07,888
Do you buy it, or do they
need to be better up front?

261
00:10:07,888 --> 00:10:09,143
- No, they need to be better up front.

262
00:10:09,143 --> 00:10:10,423
I'm a big believer, listen.

263
00:10:10,423 --> 00:10:13,198
Football isn't very
complicated, you gotta block,

264
00:10:13,198 --> 00:10:15,932
you gotta tackle, catch and
all those type of things.

265
00:10:15,932 --> 00:10:18,161
And what we saw from the
Arizona Cardinals last year,

266
00:10:18,161 --> 00:10:21,370
they couldn't block their
way out of a wet paper bag.

267
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:26,357
So, this is gonna be a
situation that bears watching

268
00:10:26,357 --> 00:10:29,543
as far as Kyler Murray and
protecting him moving forward.

269
00:10:29,543 --> 00:10:31,026
- [Mike] By the way,
we heard the same spiel

270
00:10:31,026 --> 00:10:32,384
a couple years ago when
I was the general manager

271
00:10:32,384 --> 00:10:33,634
of the Jets, we were trying to sign

272
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:35,078
Damien Woody the offensive lineman,

273
00:10:35,078 --> 00:10:37,029
he reminded us then about how important

274
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:38,024
the offensive line is.

275
00:10:38,024 --> 00:10:42,288
- [Damien] Yeah, and
listen, the tape don't lie.

276
00:10:42,288 --> 00:10:43,376
The tape doesn't lie.

277
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:44,806
- It was a softball, I
knew I was setting him up.

278
00:10:44,806 --> 00:10:46,840
I like to take care of
Damien on the summer show.

279
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,426
- That's right, that's right.
- To get through together.

280
00:10:48,426 --> 00:10:49,705
We got more to do, though.

281
00:10:49,705 --> 00:10:51,309
Coming up on NFL Live,

282
00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:53,542
as we mentioned earlier,
Independence Day is tomorrow.

283
00:10:53,542 --> 00:10:54,843
We're not on the air tomorrow,

284
00:10:54,843 --> 00:10:56,052
we're gonna celebrate it a day early

285
00:10:56,052 --> 00:10:58,832
with the NFL's most independent plays.

286
00:10:58,832 --> 00:11:02,667
Looking at the guys who can
do it all by themselves.

287
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:05,984
Speaking of doing it all,
Cam Newton may be rehabbing

288
00:11:05,984 --> 00:11:10,131
his throwing arm but that
doesn't mean he can't catch.

289
00:11:10,131 --> 00:11:12,334
Which quarterback has the best hands?

290
00:11:12,334 --> 00:11:15,282
Damien Woody's gonna take
a shot at ranking those.

291
00:11:15,282 --> 00:11:17,866
Plus, Jalen Ramsey, one
of the top trash-talkers

292
00:11:17,866 --> 00:11:20,446
in the game, but has he changed his ways?

293
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:24,113
We'll bring him in live
and he will tell us.

294
00:11:24,998 --> 00:11:26,515
- I go out there with a little swag.

295
00:11:26,515 --> 00:11:28,149
Sometimes, I just go out there, and just,

296
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:29,592
I just let the receiver know every play.

297
00:11:29,592 --> 00:11:31,457
Hey, this gonna be a long game for you.

298
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,377
You're trash compared to me.

299
00:11:33,377 --> 00:11:36,127
(exciting music)

300
00:11:41,657 --> 00:11:44,129
- I got a very, very
small loan from my father.

301
00:11:44,129 --> 00:11:45,164
- You gotta start somewhere.

302
00:11:45,164 --> 00:11:47,466
- I'm a reporter from the New York Times.

303
00:11:47,466 --> 00:11:49,653
Bank statements, tax returns.

304
00:11:49,653 --> 00:11:52,928
Thousands of copied
records, deeds, mortgages.

305
00:11:52,928 --> 00:11:55,831
1995 showed that he was bleeding money.

306
00:11:55,831 --> 00:11:57,802
Go through it all, understand it all.

307
00:11:57,802 --> 00:12:00,644
- Holy.
- Number by number.

308
00:12:00,644 --> 00:12:01,685
Brick by brick.

309
00:12:01,685 --> 00:12:04,240
- That's when we realized that's fraud.

310
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,407
- [Trump] I built this
empire, I did it by myself.

311
00:12:11,961 --> 00:12:15,139
- [Narrator] New, for summer,
it's Bud Light Lemon Tea,

312
00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:19,472
brewed with real lemon peels
and aged on real tea leaves.

313
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:20,795
Yes, it's real.

314
00:12:20,795 --> 00:12:22,572
No, you're not dreaming.

315
00:12:22,572 --> 00:12:23,978
Hey, don't do that.

316
00:12:23,978 --> 00:12:27,281
(funky music)

317
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:29,133
- Doesn't that cloud right
there look like a penguin?

318
00:12:29,133 --> 00:12:30,762
- That looks just like your house

319
00:12:30,762 --> 00:12:32,042
that's being burglarized, they're stealing

320
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,267
your TV right there.

321
00:12:33,267 --> 00:12:36,722
Oh, and right there, it's
a bear destroying your car.

322
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:38,328
- You need a vacation.

323
00:12:38,328 --> 00:12:41,593
- You know, Chris, some of
us don't have an offseason.

324
00:12:41,593 --> 00:12:43,868
- [Narrator] Pieces or cups?

325
00:12:43,868 --> 00:12:45,622
Pieces or cups?

326
00:12:45,622 --> 00:12:46,872
Pieces or cups?

327
00:12:48,133 --> 00:12:49,383
Pieces in cups!

328
00:12:50,494 --> 00:12:53,421
Man, we're killing it over here, huh?

329

at the Infiniti Plus Summer Sales Event

339
00:13:26,938 --> 00:13:29,259
- [Narrator] In every
trip, there's room for more

340
00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:32,259
than just the business you came for.

341
00:13:33,474 --> 00:13:35,390
Whether that's taking in every moment,

342
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:38,113
or capturing a moment worth bringing back.

343
00:13:38,113 --> 00:13:40,446
That's room for possibility.

344
00:13:46,647 --> 00:13:49,397
- Yay.
(exhaling)

345
00:13:54,175 --> 00:13:55,219
(bottle opening)

346
00:13:55,219 --> 00:13:57,430
(bouncing)

347
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:59,680

(exhaling)

352
00:14:11,619 --> 00:14:13,569
- I switched to Miralax
for my constipation.

353
00:14:13,569 --> 00:14:15,976
Stimulant laxatives forcefully
stimulate the nerves

354
00:14:15,976 --> 00:14:16,866
in your colon.

355
00:14:16,866 --> 00:14:18,752
MiraLAX works with the water in your body

356
00:14:18,752 --> 00:14:20,314
to unblock your system naturally.

357
00:14:20,314 --> 00:14:22,287
And it doesn't cause
bloating, cramping, gas,

358
00:14:22,287 --> 00:14:23,651
or a sudden urgency.

359
00:14:23,651 --> 00:14:26,817
MiraLAX, look for the pink cap.

360
00:14:26,817 --> 00:14:28,508
- So I can buy from Enterprise Car Sales,

361
00:14:28,508 --> 00:14:30,160
and you'll take any trade-in?

362
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,685
- That's right.
- Great.

363
00:14:32,685 --> 00:14:33,518
There you go.

364
00:14:33,518 --> 00:14:35,164
- Well, it does need to be a vehicle.

365
00:14:35,164 --> 00:14:37,685
- But, I need this out of my house.

366
00:14:37,685 --> 00:14:40,183
With a fair, transparent
value for every trade-in.

367
00:14:40,183 --> 00:14:41,657
Enterprise makes it easy.

368
00:14:41,657 --> 00:14:43,240
(reporters chattering)
- Yes?

369
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,507
- We were all shocked that
the Odellicatessans first pick

370
00:14:45,507 --> 00:14:47,719
of the fantasy draft would be a rookie.

371
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:49,237
Who shaped your strategy?

372
00:14:49,237 --> 00:14:51,793
- At this time--
- I'll take this one, Lindsey.

373
00:14:51,793 --> 00:14:53,508
It was mine.

374
00:14:53,508 --> 00:14:54,698
- Rollin' With My Homies?

375
00:14:54,698 --> 00:14:59,098
- I'm sorry, my lawyer says I
can't speak at this moment so.

376
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:00,750
- Honey Bunches of Oats,
is there any connection

377
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,350
between your attire and
your record last season?

378
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,183
- Oh, no.

379
00:15:04,183 --> 00:15:05,536
- [Narrator] Do you
take your fantasy draft

380
00:15:05,536 --> 00:15:06,980
as serious as we do?

381
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,975
Prove it, for the chance to
have Commissioner Goodell

382
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:13,142
host your league's draft
live at NFL headquarters.

383
00:15:14,338 --> 00:15:17,587
- [Narrator] NFL Live
is brought to you by,

384
00:15:17,587 --> 00:15:20,670
Pizza Hut, no one out-pizzas the Hut.

385
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:28,531
- It's something that my
mom always warns me about,

386
00:15:28,531 --> 00:15:31,031
you only get one set of teeth.

387
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:36,685
- From ear to ear, he's always smiling.

388
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,935
(laughing)

389
00:15:40,962 --> 00:15:43,366
- I'm happy to be a part of that.

390
00:15:43,366 --> 00:15:46,290
- He's always kidding
around and keeping it light.

391
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:49,256
- If I'm feeling good, I
know that it's gonna be

392
00:15:49,256 --> 00:15:51,923
contagious enough around others.

393
00:15:54,825 --> 00:15:57,177
- [Dan] Why is Cam Newton
smiling, because he's awesome.

394
00:15:57,177 --> 00:16:00,066
He can run, he can throw,
and apparently he can catch.

395
00:16:00,066 --> 00:16:02,946
Recently, in an Under Armour
camp showing off his hands

396
00:16:02,946 --> 00:16:05,876
running a go route, catching
a one-hander behind his back.

397
00:16:05,876 --> 00:16:08,897
Odell Beckham has got nothing on Cam.

398
00:16:08,897 --> 00:16:12,582
So, got us to thinking as
we do in the offseason,

399
00:16:12,582 --> 00:16:14,338
and I know Damien always says
we don't give quarterbacks

400
00:16:14,338 --> 00:16:16,028
enough attention around here.

401
00:16:16,028 --> 00:16:19,135
One of the most best
quarterback catches of all-time.

402
00:16:19,135 --> 00:16:21,266
This Mohammed Sanu pass had
trouble written all over it

403
00:16:21,266 --> 00:16:22,942
until Andy Dalton made a leaping catch

404
00:16:22,942 --> 00:16:24,568
to bail out his receiver.

405
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:26,516
Took it rest of the way to the endzone,

406
00:16:26,516 --> 00:16:29,439
finishing with a sweet dive to the pylon.

407
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,193
Look at Andy laying out.

408
00:16:31,193 --> 00:16:32,541
- [Damien] He could've
gotten smoked right there.

409
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,057
- [Dan] What about Andrew Luck in college.

410
00:16:34,057 --> 00:16:35,418
He had a couple of targets last season,

411
00:16:35,418 --> 00:16:37,587
maybe it's because Frank Reich took a look

412
00:16:37,587 --> 00:16:40,690
at this one-handed catch he
made when he was at Stanford.

413
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:41,666
The catch is impressive enough,

414
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:42,514
but he also gets that foot in-bounds.

415
00:16:42,514 --> 00:16:43,354
- [Damien] Wow.

416
00:16:43,354 --> 00:16:44,660
- [Dan] Not a catch in
the NFL though, right?

417
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,722
- [Damien] Not a catch in the NFL.

418
00:16:45,722 --> 00:16:46,890
- [Dan] Gotta work on that toe tap.

419
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:47,723
- [Damien] Gotta drag it.

420
00:16:47,723 --> 00:16:49,973
- Great athlete though.
- Yeah, no kidding.

421
00:16:49,973 --> 00:16:51,721
- That's pretty clear there.

422
00:16:51,721 --> 00:16:53,336
But I don't think they're
gonna have him doing

423
00:16:53,336 --> 00:16:54,406
too much of that.

424
00:16:54,406 --> 00:16:56,149
Of course, the Philly special.

425
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:58,101
How do we forget the Philly special?

426
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:00,952
First catch by a quarterback
in Super Bowl history.

427
00:17:00,952 --> 00:17:03,096
Nick Foles's acting job before the snap

428
00:17:03,096 --> 00:17:06,519
might've been even more
impressive than the catch itself.

429
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:09,571
But what a moment, all-time moment in NFL,

430
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:11,596
and certainly Eagles history.

431
00:17:11,596 --> 00:17:14,587
So obviously, quarterbacks
are all-around athletes too.

432
00:17:14,587 --> 00:17:15,420
(Damien sighs)

433
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,323
In some cases.
- Yeah.

434
00:17:16,323 --> 00:17:17,905
- I know, I know, it hurts you.

435
00:17:17,905 --> 00:17:18,859
- It hurts.

436
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:21,308
- To give this much praise to
quarterbacks, but here we are.

437
00:17:21,308 --> 00:17:22,952
It's July 3rd, man, we're gonna do it.

438
00:17:22,952 --> 00:17:24,513
We're gonna grind out this content.

439
00:17:24,513 --> 00:17:27,610
Damien, I want your list of
the most versatile quarterbacks

440
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:28,857
currently playing in the NFL.

441
00:17:28,857 --> 00:17:30,783
The guys who can do remarkable things.

442
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:32,561
- Yeah, so number five, we're gonna start

443
00:17:32,561 --> 00:17:36,764
with this big guy right
here in Josh Allen.

444
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,086
The thing I love about, Josh,

445
00:17:38,086 --> 00:17:39,654
everyone talks about the
huge cannon arm, right?

446
00:17:39,654 --> 00:17:40,725
He can throw it all over the place.

447
00:17:40,725 --> 00:17:42,213
But look it here, I didn't know he was

448
00:17:42,213 --> 00:17:43,946
an Olympic hurdler as well.

449
00:17:43,946 --> 00:17:46,293
I mean, just jumping
over the Minnesota Viking

450
00:17:46,293 --> 00:17:47,283
defender right there.

451
00:17:47,283 --> 00:17:52,283
I mean, that was a huge play
in that Buffalo Bills win

452
00:17:52,584 --> 00:17:54,116
up in Minnesota last year.

453
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:56,507
So, this dude is a tremendous athlete.

454
00:17:56,507 --> 00:17:58,658
Look for him to have a big year this year.

455
00:17:58,658 --> 00:18:00,146
- He led the Bills rushing last year.

456
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:01,507
- That's right, that's right.

457
00:18:01,507 --> 00:18:03,426
- You guys were looking at
quarterbacks a little bit,

458
00:18:03,426 --> 00:18:04,770
you know, with the Dolphins two years ago.

459
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:06,048
What'd you think him coming out?

460
00:18:06,048 --> 00:18:07,366
- Yeah, everything that Damien said.

461
00:18:07,366 --> 00:18:09,870
He's big, strong, can make all the throws.

462
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,966
He's gonna have to learn how
to kind of corral that in,

463
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:13,773
so he can play a full season.

464
00:18:13,773 --> 00:18:15,048
He's gonna be taking a lot of hits.

465
00:18:15,048 --> 00:18:16,546
- You mean play quarterback?
- Yeah.

466
00:18:16,546 --> 00:18:18,324
(laughing)

467
00:18:18,324 --> 00:18:19,707
- Number four, what you got?

468
00:18:19,707 --> 00:18:21,616
- Number four right here,
we're gonna go right here

469
00:18:21,616 --> 00:18:23,136
with Mitchell Trubisky.

470
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:25,888
I mean, listen, I almost
wanna call Mitchell,

471
00:18:25,888 --> 00:18:27,097
Mitchell Vick.

472
00:18:27,097 --> 00:18:29,481
You look at this run right
here, he started at the 15,

473
00:18:29,481 --> 00:18:31,484
goes all the way back to the 30.

474
00:18:31,484 --> 00:18:33,360
This play here against
the New England Patriots.

475
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,030
Just watch this guy run.

476
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,591
He's a really good athlete.

477
00:18:36,591 --> 00:18:39,127
He can really run with
the football in his hand.

478
00:18:39,127 --> 00:18:43,007
Dangerous both throwing
and running the football.

479
00:18:43,007 --> 00:18:46,278
So again, guy just
takes off in the pocket.

480
00:18:46,278 --> 00:18:49,195
He's pulling away from people here.

481
00:18:50,349 --> 00:18:53,976
Listen, when a defense gotta
defend both of those aspects

482
00:18:53,976 --> 00:18:56,858
of a quarterback, makes it awfully tough.

483
00:18:56,858 --> 00:18:58,466
- I think he's done a
great job of designing

484
00:18:58,466 --> 00:19:00,361
an offense to play to his strength.

485
00:19:00,361 --> 00:19:02,422
Brought a lot of those Andy
Reid concepts from Kansas City.

486
00:19:02,422 --> 00:19:04,073
That's a hard offense to defend.

487
00:19:04,073 --> 00:19:05,323
- Number three?

488
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:10,885
- So, number three, get you a quarterback

489
00:19:10,885 --> 00:19:11,768
that can do both.

490
00:19:11,768 --> 00:19:12,983
We got Big Ben here.

491
00:19:12,983 --> 00:19:15,130
Listen, we all know Big Ben
is a future Hall of Famer,

492
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,254
but how about this?

493
00:19:16,254 --> 00:19:18,792
How about with the pooch punt right here.

494
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:22,151
Playing situational
football, at that Mike T.

495
00:19:22,151 --> 00:19:24,834
Situational football,
downed the ball inside

496
00:19:24,834 --> 00:19:26,760
the one yard line, huge play.

497
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,193
Again, Big Ben showing off his prowess

498
00:19:29,193 --> 00:19:31,193
with another pooch punt.

499
00:19:32,614 --> 00:19:34,038
Setting it up right here, setting it up

500
00:19:34,038 --> 00:19:35,622
for the special teams, so.

501
00:19:35,622 --> 00:19:36,913
When you got a quarterback
that can not only

502
00:19:36,913 --> 00:19:38,565
go out there and throw for 300 yards,

503
00:19:38,565 --> 00:19:41,992
but can set your field position up,

504
00:19:41,992 --> 00:19:43,226
guy deserves to get paid.

505
00:19:43,226 --> 00:19:44,262
- You know, he must enjoy that.

506
00:19:44,262 --> 00:19:46,115
They call that pooch punt,
he must be loving it.

507
00:19:46,115 --> 00:19:46,953
- Oh, absolutely, absolutely.

508
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:49,038
- Must be hard to keep a
poker face. Number two?

509
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:53,775
- So, number two, we got Killa
Cam, Cam Newton right here.

510
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:54,643
- Number two, huh?

511
00:19:54,643 --> 00:19:56,549
- Listen, Cam Newton is
obviously a physical freak

512
00:19:56,549 --> 00:19:58,651
of nature, you're going
to see why right here.

513
00:19:58,651 --> 00:20:00,588
That little trick play, boom!

514
00:20:00,588 --> 00:20:03,393
Dropped the hammer down
on the defensive lineman.

515
00:20:03,393 --> 00:20:06,515
How many quarterbacks are willing
to throw their shoulder in

516
00:20:06,515 --> 00:20:08,145
on a defensive lineman right here.

517
00:20:08,145 --> 00:20:11,589
Just knocking him down to the ground.

518
00:20:11,589 --> 00:20:14,019
Cam's not a small, Cam's
a big boy at quarterback.

519
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:16,360
So, it really doesn't surprise me that he

520
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,127
knocked that defensive
lineman on his butt,

521
00:20:18,127 --> 00:20:20,934
but again, an offensive
lineman can appreciate

522
00:20:20,934 --> 00:20:22,795
a quarterback that's
willing to throw his body

523
00:20:22,795 --> 00:20:23,950
in there for the play.

524
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,146
- He is physically imposing.

525
00:20:25,146 --> 00:20:26,592
When you see him come out for warm-ups.

526
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:28,200
You think wow, this guy could be a lot.

527
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,102
He is a physically imposing player

528
00:20:30,102 --> 00:20:31,295
that happens to be a quarterback.

529
00:20:31,295 --> 00:20:32,289
- That's right, that's right.

530
00:20:32,289 --> 00:20:33,580
- Couldn't even do a quarterback segment

531
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:38,275
without you talking about
blocking, unbelievable.

532
00:20:38,275 --> 00:20:39,552
- And then obviously.
- This guy.

533
00:20:39,552 --> 00:20:43,064
- This right here, Hall
of Famer right here,

534
00:20:43,064 --> 00:20:43,935
Patrick Mahomes.

535
00:20:43,935 --> 00:20:45,962
And listen, we always
talk about, as a father,

536
00:20:45,962 --> 00:20:47,324
you always talk about having your kids

537
00:20:47,324 --> 00:20:48,846
involved in more than one sport.

538
00:20:48,846 --> 00:20:52,266
Well here's why, you see
a guy in Patrick Mahomes.

539
00:20:52,266 --> 00:20:55,364
Great football player,
also great baseball player.

540
00:20:55,364 --> 00:20:57,922
You see him throwing from
all different arm angles.

541
00:20:57,922 --> 00:21:01,177
Being able to make plays,
throwing with his left hand.

542
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:03,609
I mean, he did this time
after after time again

543
00:21:03,609 --> 00:21:05,914
during the season, and
that's what made him special.

544
00:21:05,914 --> 00:21:08,899
No-look passes, and to
me that's the product

545
00:21:08,899 --> 00:21:10,966
of playing multiple sports.

546
00:21:10,966 --> 00:21:13,907
They kind of intertwine with each other.

547
00:21:13,907 --> 00:21:16,915
And the big reason why he
was the NFL MVP last year.

548
00:21:16,915 --> 00:21:18,606
- Mike, when you're
evaluating quarterbacks,

549
00:21:18,606 --> 00:21:20,296
and you look at all-around play.

550
00:21:20,296 --> 00:21:22,605
How much does it factor
in, how athletic they are,

551
00:21:22,605 --> 00:21:24,760
or whether they can do
other stuff like this?

552
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,593
- It's really important.

553
00:21:25,593 --> 00:21:27,283
Look, it starts with accuracy.

554
00:21:27,283 --> 00:21:28,955
But being able to buy a second chance.

555
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,233
You know, we touched on
it earlier in the show

556
00:21:30,233 --> 00:21:32,075
about Kyler Murray playing behind that

557
00:21:32,075 --> 00:21:33,117
Arizona offensive line.

558
00:21:33,117 --> 00:21:35,738
The fact that he'll be able to avoid,

559
00:21:35,738 --> 00:21:37,751
move up in the pocket,
sometimes it's not about

560
00:21:37,751 --> 00:21:40,354
just gaining yards, but it's
about avoiding the big hit,

561
00:21:40,354 --> 00:21:42,652
extending the play, keeping
your eyes down the field.

562
00:21:42,652 --> 00:21:44,060
It's really important, and that's a skill

563
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,630
that transfers from college to pros.

564
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,160
And, as you mentioned, Damien,

565
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,084
what Patrick Mahomes did at
Texas Tech in that offense

566
00:21:51,084 --> 00:21:52,814
we're seeing with the Kansas City Chiefs.

567
00:21:52,814 --> 00:21:54,488
- Do you guys know, trivia time here.

568
00:21:54,488 --> 00:21:56,686
Do you guys know which
active NFL quarterback

569
00:21:56,686 --> 00:21:59,019
has the most career catches?

570
00:22:00,253 --> 00:22:02,167
(sighs)
They don't know.

571
00:22:02,167 --> 00:22:03,000
- No.

572
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,809
- Drew Brees, he has eight.

573
00:22:04,809 --> 00:22:06,172
- Wow.
- How about that?

574
00:22:06,172 --> 00:22:07,194
- Eight?
- Really?

575
00:22:07,194 --> 00:22:08,772
- Yeah, we'll run them
back, we'll run them back.

576
00:22:08,772 --> 00:22:10,781
Maybe another show, later in the summer,

577
00:22:10,781 --> 00:22:12,451
we'll do Drew Brees highlight catches.

578
00:22:12,451 --> 00:22:13,663
And maybe have you rank them.

579
00:22:13,663 --> 00:22:15,766
- For the content, we need the content.

580
00:22:15,766 --> 00:22:18,431
When we come back, Jalen
Ramsey's not been shy

581
00:22:18,431 --> 00:22:20,037
about sharing his opinion on things

582
00:22:20,037 --> 00:22:21,381
like quarterback rankings.

583
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,999
Now, he's got a Super Bowl
MVP leading his offense.

584
00:22:23,999 --> 00:22:26,469
Does Jalen think Nick
Foles can lead this team

585
00:22:26,469 --> 00:22:28,127
to a championship?

586
00:22:28,127 --> 00:22:29,877
He will join us live.

587
00:22:33,114 --> 00:22:35,607
- Remember that degree
you got in taxation?

588
00:22:35,607 --> 00:22:38,453
Of course you don't, because you didn't.

589
00:22:38,453 --> 00:22:40,666
Your job isn't understanding tax code,

590
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:44,416
it's understanding why that
will get him a body like that.

591
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:45,249
Move!

592
00:22:46,128 --> 00:22:47,384
That.

593
00:22:47,384 --> 00:22:50,089
Your job isn't doing hard work, here.

594
00:22:50,089 --> 00:22:52,739
It's making her do hard work

595
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:54,579
and getting paid for it.

00:24:53,544 --> 00:24:55,863
and neither of our bodies
have changed a bit.

634
00:24:55,863 --> 00:24:58,893
Hey, hey, eyes up here my man.

635
00:24:58,893 --> 00:25:00,476

650

- [MLK] We hold these
truths to be self-evident

651
00:25:37,061 --> 00:25:39,367
that all men are created equal.

652
00:25:39,367 --> 00:25:41,565

to a new generation of Americans.

654
00:25:43,768 --> 00:25:45,147
- [Barbara Jordan] The American Dream

655
00:25:45,147 --> 00:25:47,554
need not forever be deferred.

656
00:25:47,554 --> 00:25:50,892
- As the richest, and the
most powerful country.

657
00:25:50,892 --> 00:25:53,475
(gentle music)

658
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:09,662
- [Jalen] Hey, if you dream
about catching this ball on me,

659
00:26:09,662 --> 00:26:11,765
you better wake up and apologize.

660
00:26:11,765 --> 00:26:13,378
I go out there with a little swag.

661
00:26:13,378 --> 00:26:15,336
You soft today, like, you weak today.

662
00:26:15,336 --> 00:26:16,819
- [Announcer] It's picked
off by Jalen Ramsey.

663
00:26:16,819 --> 00:26:19,378
It looked like Ramsey came over the top.

664
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:20,211
- [Mike] He's a physical corner

665
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:22,099
who can suffocate any receiver.

666
00:26:22,099 --> 00:26:23,524
- [Jalen] Sometimes, I just go out there.

667
00:26:23,524 --> 00:26:25,375
I'll let the receiver know every play,

668
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,476
hey this is gonna be a long game for you.

669
00:26:27,476 --> 00:26:29,457
I'll call out their route
just to let them know,

670
00:26:29,457 --> 00:26:31,234
look, I'm on my game today.

671
00:26:31,234 --> 00:26:34,380
- [Announcer] Intercepted by Jalen Ramsey.

672
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,610
- [Jalen] You're trash compared to me.

673
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:39,610
(catchy rock music)

674
00:26:41,772 --> 00:26:43,261
- Very pleased to welcome in to NFL Live,

675
00:26:43,261 --> 00:26:46,504
Jaguars cornerback, Jalen
Ramsey, who joins us today

676
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:48,573
from London, England.

677
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:50,770
Jalen, I gotta start here, I was dismayed

678
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:52,744
when you recently told our Adam Scheffter

679
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:54,671
that you were going to
get out of the business

680
00:26:54,671 --> 00:26:56,254
of evaluating quarterbacks.

681
00:26:56,254 --> 00:27:00,671
You were so good at it, why
have you decided to stop?

682
00:27:02,475 --> 00:27:07,225
- Really, I went through most
of them last year, I think.

683
00:27:08,646 --> 00:27:11,246
To be honest, I didn't think
I needed to do it again.

684
00:27:11,246 --> 00:27:13,466
My opinions were my opinions,

685
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:15,229
and they didn't really change too much.

686
00:27:15,229 --> 00:27:19,444
So yeah, I just didn't feel
the need to do it again.

687
00:27:19,444 --> 00:27:22,173
I wanted to pump up Nick
a little bit at mini-camp,

688
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:24,926
and I was excited to see Nick out there.

689
00:27:24,926 --> 00:27:26,790
So I wanted to pump Nick up a little bit.

690
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:30,226
But yeah, just got away
from it for a little bit.

691
00:27:30,226 --> 00:27:31,674
- I'm gonna ask you about
Nick in a little bit,

692
00:27:31,674 --> 00:27:33,398
but I'm wondering as you went
around the league last year,

693
00:27:33,398 --> 00:27:35,803
did you hear a lot about
that interview that you gave

694
00:27:35,803 --> 00:27:38,224
where you talked about
all the quarterbacks?

695
00:27:38,224 --> 00:27:42,797
People give you a hard time,
or tell you you were right?

696
00:27:42,797 --> 00:27:45,880
- Yeah, I mean, it was opinion-based.

697
00:27:48,183 --> 00:27:50,614
Exactly how it went, we were
just talking a little bit,

698
00:27:50,614 --> 00:27:53,003
and we started off naming,
like, who I thought

699
00:27:53,003 --> 00:27:54,039
were the top five quarterbacks.

700
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,858
And then we started going
down the whole list,

701
00:27:55,858 --> 00:27:58,498
and I was kind of saying,
kind of still keeping

702
00:27:58,498 --> 00:28:00,812
that mindframe, like
yeah he's not top five,

703
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:03,544
or he's overrated, his this,
that, he's sorry, he's good.

704
00:28:03,544 --> 00:28:05,155
Whatever, he gets the job done.

705
00:28:05,155 --> 00:28:07,802
Whatever I was saying about
each every quarterback.

706
00:28:07,802 --> 00:28:09,243
Yeah, just giving some opinions.

707
00:28:09,243 --> 00:28:12,654
Some people, of course,
they're gonna agree,

708
00:28:12,654 --> 00:28:13,970
and some people are not gonna agree.

709
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:16,394
Everybody's entitled to their own opinion.

710
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:17,513
- Absolutely, we enjoy it.

711
00:28:17,513 --> 00:28:20,645
But you mentioned, your new
quarterback, Nick Foles,

712
00:28:20,645 --> 00:28:23,037
joining the Jaguars as
a free agent this year.

713
00:28:23,037 --> 00:28:26,876
What's the one thing about him
that jumps out at your so far

714
00:28:26,876 --> 00:28:31,543
that you may not have known
before he was your teammate?

715
00:28:34,417 --> 00:28:36,814
- I mean, just how well
he practices, I guess.

716
00:28:36,814 --> 00:28:38,872
Because, I've of course
never practiced with him.

717
00:28:38,872 --> 00:28:40,824
And those three days in
mini-camp, I got to see

718
00:28:40,824 --> 00:28:43,063
how he comes out there and he works hard.

719
00:28:43,063 --> 00:28:45,831
And he pushes the guys
and he leads the offense.

720
00:28:45,831 --> 00:28:47,066
It was truly impressive.

721
00:28:47,066 --> 00:28:49,532
I had already known and heard about

722
00:28:49,532 --> 00:28:51,075
how good of a teammate
he was, and how good

723
00:28:51,075 --> 00:28:53,879
of a person he was in general.

724
00:28:53,879 --> 00:28:56,411
Just seeing him in the locker
room, being in his presence,

725
00:28:56,411 --> 00:28:58,202
and, you know, communicating with him

726
00:28:58,202 --> 00:29:02,329
in our few interactions,
it was super nice.

727
00:29:02,329 --> 00:29:04,437
- So, starting quarterback
is obviously a major change

728
00:29:04,437 --> 00:29:06,207
on any NFL team.

729
00:29:06,207 --> 00:29:08,428
What's the biggest
difference in the Jaguars

730
00:29:08,428 --> 00:29:12,678
this year versus last year
having made that change?

731
00:29:13,628 --> 00:29:16,878
- Yeah, I do feel like it's an upgrade.

732
00:29:17,794 --> 00:29:20,461
Of course, I was a fan of Blake.

733
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:24,058
Blake was a really good
teammate to everybody.

734
00:29:24,058 --> 00:29:27,676
But, you know, having Nick,
a former Super Bowl champion,

735
00:29:27,676 --> 00:29:31,317
and Super Bowl MVP, we have
supreme confidence in him.

736
00:29:31,317 --> 00:29:32,835
And we think that he's
going to do a good job

737
00:29:32,835 --> 00:29:34,265
of leading our offense.

738
00:29:34,265 --> 00:29:35,631
Of course, on the
defensive side of the ball,

739
00:29:35,631 --> 00:29:38,427
we are overflowing with
confidence over there,

740
00:29:38,427 --> 00:29:40,378
and talent, and guys who we think

741
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:43,479
can get the job done
over there on that side.

742
00:29:43,479 --> 00:29:45,494
So now, we've got somebody outside.

743
00:29:45,494 --> 00:29:47,502
To roll with Leonard, and DD,

744
00:29:47,502 --> 00:29:48,912
and all the other guys over there.

745
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,560
So we're super excited.

746
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,706
- So yeah, the defense
obviously completely dominant.

747
00:29:52,706 --> 00:29:55,198
Two seasons ago, you guys
came agonizingly close

748
00:29:55,198 --> 00:29:56,302
to the Super Bowl.

749
00:29:56,302 --> 00:29:57,822
And then last year,
obviously, a disappointment

750
00:29:57,822 --> 00:30:00,184
for the team all the way around.

751
00:30:00,184 --> 00:30:01,615
So what gives you the confidence

752
00:30:01,615 --> 00:30:05,115
that this can be closer to 2017 than 2018?

753
00:30:08,117 --> 00:30:12,534
- We're just gonna embrace
the journey, to be honest.

754
00:30:13,527 --> 00:30:15,719
People say, like, trust the
process and stuff like that.

755
00:30:15,719 --> 00:30:17,402
I really don't even believe in that,

756
00:30:17,402 --> 00:30:20,160
because we can make how
ever many plans we want to

757
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,959
in our head, and whatever
we feel like the process is.

758
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:24,813
But it's truly gonna be a journey.

759
00:30:24,813 --> 00:30:26,580
It's gonna be ups and
down, and highs and lows,

760
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,059
and we have to roll with all of them.

761
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:29,080
We have to roll with the highs,

762
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:29,980
we have to roll with the lows,

763
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:32,526
and we have to push
through it to make sure

764
00:30:32,526 --> 00:30:36,664
that we are in position
to win the division,

765
00:30:36,664 --> 00:30:39,706
win the conference and
go to the Super Bowl

766
00:30:39,706 --> 00:30:41,631
and compete for Super Bowls.

767
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:43,425
- You've quickly
established yourself as one

768
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:46,389
of the better players in
your position in the league.

769
00:30:46,389 --> 00:30:48,365
But the NFL being what it is, you're still

770
00:30:48,365 --> 00:30:50,418
a ways away from free agency.

771
00:30:50,418 --> 00:30:53,617
The Jaguars picked up your
contract option for 2020.

772
00:30:53,617 --> 00:30:54,450
- Yeah.

773
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:56,061
- Any extension talks yet,

774
00:30:56,061 --> 00:30:58,978
or is that still on the backburner?

775
00:31:00,663 --> 00:31:02,145
- It's on the back burner right now,

776
00:31:02,145 --> 00:31:05,330
but that's completely
fine with how first-round

777
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:09,010
contracts are structured
right now in this current CBA,

778
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:10,128
teams have a lot of leverage.

779
00:31:10,128 --> 00:31:11,558
They can pick up the fifth year option,

780
00:31:11,558 --> 00:31:14,808
so unlike other guys, who outplay their

781
00:31:16,533 --> 00:31:20,144
rookie contract and can re-up right now

782
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:22,815
and get basically what they're worth.

783
00:31:22,815 --> 00:31:24,423
First rounders don't have that luxury.

784
00:31:24,423 --> 00:31:26,601
We have the fifth year
option, then after that,

785
00:31:26,601 --> 00:31:28,618
they can either franchise
tag, and you know,

786
00:31:28,618 --> 00:31:31,660
do any and every which
thing that they want to do.

787
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:34,033
They have a little bit of leverage,

788
00:31:34,033 --> 00:31:36,809
but I'm gonna let my agent
handle a lot of that.

789
00:31:36,809 --> 00:31:38,879
I'm gonna just focus
on what I can focus on,

790
00:31:38,879 --> 00:31:40,291
and play ball and help the team win

791
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:42,278
while I'm here in Jacksonville.

792
00:31:42,278 --> 00:31:43,601
Hopefully, I'm here for a long time,

793
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:47,792
and when it's time to open
up contract negotiations,

794
00:31:47,792 --> 00:31:49,612
we'll see how things go.

795
00:31:49,612 --> 00:31:51,356
Of course, we wanted to
get it done this year,

796
00:31:51,356 --> 00:31:53,638
but it won't get done this year.

797
00:31:53,638 --> 00:31:55,254
And hey, it is what it is.

798
00:31:55,254 --> 00:31:57,533
I'm moving forward from that.

799
00:31:57,533 --> 00:32:00,979
We've talked with the
Jaguars and everybody

800
00:32:00,979 --> 00:32:03,603
who's in charge of that,
so they know what's up.

801
00:32:03,603 --> 00:32:06,051
They know how it's gonna roll.

802
00:32:06,051 --> 00:32:08,506
- So you're coming to
us from London today.

803
00:32:08,506 --> 00:32:10,707
And obviously, the big story
over here in the States

804
00:32:10,707 --> 00:32:13,527
is the US women's soccer
team beating England

805
00:32:13,527 --> 00:32:14,808
in the World Cup yesterday.

806
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:17,302
And what's caught the
attention of a lot of people

807
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:21,032
is Alex Morgan, right, the
tea sipping celebration

808
00:32:21,032 --> 00:32:21,865
of the goal.

809
00:32:21,865 --> 00:32:23,235
This has become a big,
huge thing over here

810
00:32:23,235 --> 00:32:24,434
and probably there as well.

811
00:32:24,434 --> 00:32:28,851
What are your thoughts on
it as a known trash-talker?

812
00:32:30,071 --> 00:32:31,512
- I loved it, of course.

813
00:32:31,512 --> 00:32:35,272
Just like you said, I've been
known to trash-talk, myself,

814
00:32:35,272 --> 00:32:37,569
and do a little bit of it here and there.

815
00:32:37,569 --> 00:32:38,513
So I loved it.

816
00:32:38,513 --> 00:32:41,396
I thought it was very fitting, of course,

817
00:32:41,396 --> 00:32:44,253
because of who they played, obviously.

818
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:47,670
And sealing it up, why not have some fun?

819
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:52,312
I mean, we're professional
athletes of course,

820
00:32:52,312 --> 00:32:54,473
but we're also entertainers in a sense.

821
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:56,183
We want to keep everything interesting.

822
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:59,694
So now, she gave people
everything to talk about,

823
00:32:59,694 --> 00:33:00,840
a lot to talk about.

824
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,530
I think it's cool, I think it's good.

825
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:06,130
- Jalen Ramsey, thank you
so much for joining us

826
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:08,494
on NFL Live, and sharing your insights.

827
00:33:08,494 --> 00:33:12,230
Best of luck to you this coming season.

828
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:15,876
- Appreciate it, thank you for having me.

829
00:33:15,876 --> 00:33:17,560
- All right, so back to our declarations

830
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,846
if you weren't here earlier.

831
00:33:18,846 --> 00:33:20,913
Tomorrow's the Fourth of
July and the anniversary

832
00:33:20,913 --> 00:33:22,107
of the Declaration of Independence.

833
00:33:22,107 --> 00:33:25,206
So we're making some
NFL declarations today,

834
00:33:25,206 --> 00:33:26,925
here on NFL Live.

835
00:33:26,925 --> 00:33:30,527
Earlier, Damien made a
declaration about Kirk Cousins.

836
00:33:30,527 --> 00:33:33,109
He was very vociferous.

837
00:33:33,109 --> 00:33:34,865
Mike, you got one on the Jaguars?

838
00:33:34,865 --> 00:33:36,911
- I absolutely do.

839
00:33:36,911 --> 00:33:41,843
I declare that Nick Foles will
lead the Jacksonville Jaguars

840
00:33:41,843 --> 00:33:45,003
to the Super Bowl representing the AFC.

841
00:33:45,003 --> 00:33:46,742
And I know that you know
this because you're a student

842
00:33:46,742 --> 00:33:50,273
of the game, but last
year, in division games,

843
00:33:50,273 --> 00:33:52,798
the Jacksonville Jaguars averaged less

844
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:54,294
than 10 points a game.

845
00:33:54,294 --> 00:33:57,862
You take what is already a
championship-level defense,

846
00:33:57,862 --> 00:33:59,861
led by Jalen Ramsey, and this year's

847
00:33:59,861 --> 00:34:01,520
first round pick, Josh Allen

848
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,546
with a quarterback who won
a Super Bowl two years ago,

849
00:34:04,546 --> 00:34:07,880
and but for a drop in the
last year's NFC playoffs,

850
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,880
may have brought the Eagles to
two consecutive Super Bowls,

851
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,573
so that's my declaration.

852
00:34:13,573 --> 00:34:16,051
- This is interesting because
Jalen Ramsey has, in fact,

853
00:34:16,051 --> 00:34:18,815
stayed on the line and
heard your declaration,

854
00:34:18,815 --> 00:34:19,651
Mike Tannebaum.

855
00:34:19,651 --> 00:34:21,856
So Jalen, I'm curious
what your thoughts are

856
00:34:21,856 --> 00:34:24,060
on Mike's declaration about the Jaguars.

857
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:24,893
- Yeah.

858
00:34:25,883 --> 00:34:28,198
Yeah, I love that declaration right there.

859
00:34:28,198 --> 00:34:31,395
Speak it into existence for us, I love it.

860
00:34:31,395 --> 00:34:34,228
I'm super excited to
have Nick on the team,

861
00:34:34,228 --> 00:34:37,810
and we're gonna put all
that confidence behind him,

862
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:39,836
and we're gonna let him lead the offense.

863
00:34:39,836 --> 00:34:42,221
And like you said, this defense we have,

864
00:34:42,221 --> 00:34:44,268
we think some big things could be in store

865
00:34:44,268 --> 00:34:46,160
for the 2019 season.

866
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,374
- So Jalen, when everybody else is getting

867
00:34:47,374 --> 00:34:49,871
on that Jaguar bandwagon
come the regular season,

868
00:34:49,871 --> 00:34:52,504
just remember we had this
conversation on July 3rd,

869
00:34:52,504 --> 00:34:53,718
and that was my declaration.

870
00:34:53,718 --> 00:34:56,059
So I'm with you guys, the
bandwagon starts today.

871
00:34:56,059 --> 00:34:58,533
Let's not let anybody else on.

872
00:34:58,533 --> 00:34:59,503
- Thanks, Jalen.
- I got you.

873
00:34:59,503 --> 00:35:02,565
- [Dan] We appreciate you sticking around.

874
00:35:02,565 --> 00:35:03,685
- Appreciate y'all.

875
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:04,995
- Love it.

876
00:35:04,995 --> 00:35:07,177
That declaration, we should have Jalen in,

877
00:35:07,177 --> 00:35:08,599
and he could do his declaration.

878
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:12,829
- So you just go all in on
my head about Kirk Cousins,

879
00:35:12,829 --> 00:35:15,820
but you all in on Jacksonville.

880
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:19,264
Listen, Nick Foles was
great with Doug Peterson.

881
00:35:19,264 --> 00:35:21,588
It seems like they had a chemistry.

882
00:35:21,588 --> 00:35:24,242
So you think they can
recreate that in Jacksonville

883
00:35:24,242 --> 00:35:26,531
with this whole different
cast of characters?

884
00:35:26,531 --> 00:35:27,823
- No doubt about it, and as you know,

885
00:35:27,823 --> 00:35:29,491
it starts with the offensive line.

886
00:35:29,491 --> 00:35:31,782
They have a very good offensive line.

887
00:35:31,782 --> 00:35:34,455
They added Jawaan Taylor at
right tackle, who's gonna start.

888
00:35:34,455 --> 00:35:38,372
Doug Marrone was an offensive
lineman, played, coached it,

889
00:35:38,372 --> 00:35:39,406
and now he's their head coach.

890
00:35:39,406 --> 00:35:43,099
And it allows them to travel,
play well on the road.

891
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,462
And with that defense,
they're loaded up front.

892
00:35:45,462 --> 00:35:47,353
They have a lot of depth at pass rusher,

893
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,881
when you look at last
year's first round pick,

894
00:35:48,881 --> 00:35:53,881
Tavon Bryant, (stammering).
- Ngakoue?

895
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:56,239
- Ngakoue, yes, at defensive end.

896
00:35:56,239 --> 00:35:59,037
And Calais Campbell, and
again Josh Allen this year.

897
00:35:59,037 --> 00:36:01,355
I think they have depth up front.

898
00:36:01,355 --> 00:36:04,012
They have two cover corners in AJ Bouye,

899
00:36:04,012 --> 00:36:05,337
and Jalen Ramsey, you saw.

900
00:36:05,337 --> 00:36:06,600
I think they're really built well.

901
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,715
And now you have
below-average quarterback play

902
00:36:08,715 --> 00:36:11,281
in Blake Bortles, and we're
being generous with that.

903
00:36:11,281 --> 00:36:13,530
And Nick Foles is a good quarterback,

904
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:15,149
so that's my declaration.

905
00:36:15,149 --> 00:36:16,185
- I'll tell you one big difference,

906
00:36:16,185 --> 00:36:17,854
and that might be the
reason they sign him.

907
00:36:17,854 --> 00:36:20,871
Foles only threw 23
interceptions in 40 games

908
00:36:20,871 --> 00:36:23,791
in Philadelphia, Bortles
had 58 interceptions

909
00:36:23,791 --> 00:36:25,507
in 60 games with the Jaguars.

910
00:36:25,507 --> 00:36:27,848
So they should be better there.

911
00:36:27,848 --> 00:36:30,698
We're gonna have more
declarations later in the show.

912
00:36:30,698 --> 00:36:32,106
We're also gonna talk some soccer.

913
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:34,460
Alex Morgan shook up the Twitterverse

914
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,282
with her tea sipping goal celebration

915
00:36:36,282 --> 00:36:37,773
that Jalen Ramsey enjoyed.

916
00:36:37,773 --> 00:36:40,382
Which celebrations from
NFL history compare

917
00:36:40,382 --> 00:36:43,157
to this surprisingly controversial one?

918
00:36:43,157 --> 00:36:45,766
Stay tuned to NFL Live,
we'll talk about it.

919
00:36:45,766 --> 00:36:48,516
(exciting music)

920
00:36:51,168 --> 00:36:53,259
- [Narrator] Why use
Post-It Extreme Notes?

921
00:36:53,259 --> 00:36:55,393
Because they make your message stick.

922
00:36:55,393 --> 00:36:58,650
Getting it said and done
right the first time.

923
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,855
- [Man in Jacket] Oh, come on!

924
00:37:00,855 --> 00:37:05,263
- [Narrator] Stop the re-work
with Post-it Extreme Notes.

925
00:37:05,263 --> 00:37:06,437
(lifeguard whistle blowing)
- Not running!

926
00:37:06,437 --> 00:37:07,745
Why am I not running?

927
00:37:07,745 --> 00:37:09,365
Because the DQ Summer Blizzard menu

928
00:37:09,365 --> 00:37:12,605
is only here for a few more
weeks with seven great flavors,

929
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:15,239
like new Sour Patch
Kids and Brownie Dough.

930
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:18,208
(lifeguard whistle blows)
- Not running!

931
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,222
- [Narrator] DQ, Happy tastes good.

932
00:37:20,222 --> 00:37:21,462
(bell ringing)

933
00:37:21,462 --> 00:37:22,295
- Hi.
- Hi.

934
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:24,274
- Hi.

935
00:37:24,274 --> 00:37:26,575
- (chuckles) We all just got
new smartphones at Cricket.

936
00:37:26,575 --> 00:37:28,111
- Hi.
- Hi.

937
00:37:28,111 --> 00:37:28,944
- Hola.

938
00:37:28,944 --> 00:37:29,777
- Hi.
- Hi.

939
00:37:31,127 --> 00:37:32,627
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

940
00:37:35,682 --> 00:37:37,883
- [Narrator] Is Bud Light
Orange coming back this summer

941
00:37:37,883 --> 00:37:39,373
and never leaving?

942
00:37:39,373 --> 00:37:42,145
And brewed with real orange peels?

943
00:37:42,145 --> 00:37:44,424
The answer is yes.

944
00:37:44,424 --> 00:37:45,507

- [Narrator] If you're thinking
about buying a new home,

967
00:38:52,776 --> 00:38:54,068
here's some great news.

968
00:38:54,068 --> 00:38:55,843
Mortgage interest rates have dropped.

969
00:38:55,843 --> 00:38:58,670
This means right now is a
perfect time to save money

970
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,572
when you're ready to buy a new home.

971
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:03,558
But even if you're not ready
to buy quite yet, that's okay.

972
00:39:03,558 --> 00:39:05,463
At Quicken Loans, we
believe you should be able

973
00:39:05,463 --> 00:39:07,583
to benefit from a great rate before you

974
00:39:07,583 --> 00:39:09,611
even begin your home search.

975
00:39:09,611 --> 00:39:11,947
That's why Quicken Loans
created our exclusive

976
00:39:11,947 --> 00:39:13,398
RateShield Approval.

977
00:39:13,398 --> 00:39:15,550
It's designed to protect
you from unpredictable

978
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:16,512
interest rates.

979
00:39:16,512 --> 00:39:18,667
Here's how our RateShield Approval works.

980
00:39:18,667 --> 00:39:21,366
First, we lock your interest
rate for up to 90 days

981
00:39:21,366 --> 00:39:22,895
while you find your new home.

982
00:39:22,895 --> 00:39:24,516
Then, once you've found your new home,

983
00:39:24,516 --> 00:39:27,129
if rates have gone up,
your low rate stays locked.

984
00:39:27,129 --> 00:39:29,730
But if rates have gone
down, your rate drops,

985
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:32,334
and you get to keep that new, lower rate.

986
00:39:32,334 --> 00:39:35,246
Remember, mortgage interest
rates are low right now,

987
00:39:35,246 --> 00:39:37,601
and that's great, but you
never know when they may rise

988
00:39:37,601 --> 00:39:39,762
So protect yourself, and take the worry

989
00:39:39,762 --> 00:39:41,840
out of unpredictable interest rates

990
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:45,370
with a RateShield Approval,
exclusively from Quicken Loans.

1017
00:41:11,312 --> 00:41:13,965
We've got a triple-header
starting at 7:30 Eastern

1018
00:41:13,965 --> 00:41:16,025
on ESPN, and you won't want to miss

1019
00:41:16,025 --> 00:41:18,860
that special matchup at 9:30 Eastern Time

1020
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,731
featuring former Duke teammates,

1021
00:41:20,731 --> 00:41:23,320
Zion Williamson and RJ Barrett facing off

1022
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,570
for the first time as pros.

1023
00:41:27,325 --> 00:41:31,216
Speaking of the NBA,
Lakers fan Damien Woody

1024
00:41:31,216 --> 00:41:34,529
insists that we talk
about the Kawhi Leonard

1025
00:41:34,529 --> 00:41:36,759
free agency situation.

1026
00:41:36,759 --> 00:41:39,367
Still waiting for word from
Kawhi on where he'll end up.

1027
00:41:39,367 --> 00:41:41,529
But if it is the Lakers, Damien's excited

1028
00:41:41,529 --> 00:41:43,082
to see that picture right there.

1029
00:41:43,082 --> 00:41:44,125
- That's right, that's right.

1030
00:41:44,125 --> 00:41:46,399
- Would form an imposing big three

1031
00:41:46,399 --> 00:41:48,430
with LeBron James and Anthony Davis.

1032
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:50,816
So, I feel like I've said
this about 20 times today.

1033
00:41:50,816 --> 00:41:52,998
That got us thinking.
- Got us thinking.

1034
00:41:52,998 --> 00:41:55,273
- About NFL big threes, and we're looking

1035
00:41:55,273 --> 00:41:57,299
at some pretty good ones right here.

1036
00:41:57,299 --> 00:41:59,122
Mike Tannenbaum, why don't
you rank them for us.

1037
00:41:59,122 --> 00:42:01,597
Count them down starting five to one.

1038
00:42:01,597 --> 00:42:03,217
- All right, number five, I'm gonna go

1039
00:42:03,217 --> 00:42:08,126
with the LA Rams, staying
in LA, with come on over.

1040
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:09,542
- There you go.
- There we go.

1041
00:42:09,542 --> 00:42:12,018
- Jared Goff, Brendan
Cooks, and Todd Gurley.

1042
00:42:12,018 --> 00:42:14,762
The reason why they're only
five is while I like Cooks,

1043
00:42:14,762 --> 00:42:16,767
I don't see him as an elite receiver.

1044
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:19,245
He's straight-line,
he's fast, but not great

1045
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:21,654
at changing direction, so
that's why they're five for me.

1046
00:42:21,654 --> 00:42:23,524
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1047
00:42:23,524 --> 00:42:24,826
Got them to the Super Bowl.

1048
00:42:24,826 --> 00:42:27,333
- Number four, the Atlanta Falcons.

1049
00:42:27,333 --> 00:42:30,191
You look at Matt Ryan,
Super Bowl quarterback,

1050
00:42:30,191 --> 00:42:33,590
Julio Jones, arguably the
best receiver in the NFL.

1051
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:35,960
And then, obviously, Freeman
coming off the injury,

1052
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,558
but he's a good running back.

1053
00:42:37,558 --> 00:42:40,821
So, I think that's a really
solid three guys right there.

1054
00:42:40,821 --> 00:42:42,458
- Both of those running
backs coming off of injury.

1055
00:42:42,458 --> 00:42:44,489
Their seasons could really
rest on those two guys

1056
00:42:44,489 --> 00:42:45,638
to some extent, right?

1057
00:42:45,638 --> 00:42:47,013
- [Damien] Absolutely,
and you know, the Falcons,

1058
00:42:47,013 --> 00:42:48,606
they drafted a couple of linemen up front,

1059
00:42:48,606 --> 00:42:51,781
so it should be good news for Matt Ryan

1060
00:42:51,781 --> 00:42:53,030
and Devonta Freeman.

1061
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:54,391
- Always the linemen, huh?
- Yeah, that's right.

1062
00:42:54,391 --> 00:42:56,174
- We should have done big
three offensive linemen.

1063
00:42:56,174 --> 00:42:57,047
- Yeah, exactly.

1064
00:42:57,047 --> 00:42:58,497
- Cowboy and whatever else.

1065
00:42:58,497 --> 00:43:00,241
- Number three, the Dallas Cowboys.

1066
00:43:00,241 --> 00:43:01,262
- Hey.

1067
00:43:01,262 --> 00:43:02,737
- A lot of people don't realize this,

1068
00:43:02,737 --> 00:43:07,737
but Dak Prescott, 32-16 as
a starting NFL quarterback.

1069
00:43:07,925 --> 00:43:10,108
Ezekiel Elliott, arguably
as good a running back

1070
00:43:10,108 --> 00:43:11,053
as there is in the league.

1071
00:43:11,053 --> 00:43:13,257
And Amari Cooper, all they did last year

1072
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:15,819
was go 7-2 after the trade.

1073
00:43:15,819 --> 00:43:17,939
And they were number one
over the last nine games

1074
00:43:17,939 --> 00:43:19,106
on third down.

1075
00:43:20,974 --> 00:43:22,414
- [Dan] Number two, what have you got?

1076
00:43:22,414 --> 00:43:24,803
- Okay, the New Orleans Saints, led by

1077
00:43:24,803 --> 00:43:27,313
future Hall of Famer,
Drew Brees at quarterback.

1078
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:28,146
- [Dan] Heard of him.

1079
00:43:28,146 --> 00:43:30,861
- Michael Thomas, who is.
- He's not bad.

1080
00:43:30,861 --> 00:43:34,132
- Who is not bad, right maybe
a tick below Julio Jones,

1081
00:43:34,132 --> 00:43:35,854
and not far behind him, Alvin Kumara.

1082
00:43:35,854 --> 00:43:37,467
And what I love about Kumara is not only

1083
00:43:37,467 --> 00:43:39,269
is he a great running back, but he's great

1084
00:43:39,269 --> 00:43:40,846
out of the backfield as a receiver.

1085
00:43:40,846 --> 00:43:44,312
And he puts so much pressure
on other teams' defense.

1086
00:43:44,312 --> 00:43:46,348
- [Dan] Who could be better than that?

1087
00:43:46,348 --> 00:43:48,382
I'm a little surprised
that's not number one.

1088
00:43:48,382 --> 00:43:51,801
- Yeah let's see, Mike.
- Who you got at number one?

1089
00:43:51,801 --> 00:43:54,059
- One of your former teams.
- Oh, okay.

1090
00:43:54,059 --> 00:43:55,098
- The New England Patriots.

1091
00:43:55,098 --> 00:43:58,633
As someone that's been in
the AFC East for 20 years,

1092
00:43:58,633 --> 00:44:00,204
trying to compete with these guys.

1093
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:03,107
Tom Brady, best quarterback of all-time.

1094
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:06,971
Julian Edelman, I have so
much respect and admiration

1095
00:44:06,971 --> 00:44:09,839
for him, college quarterback,
he has rolled himself

1096
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:10,800
into a great player.

1097
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,458
And look, Sony Michel is
the player that Zeke Elliott

1098
00:44:13,458 --> 00:44:16,500
or Alvin Kumara is, but
he was a first round pick,

1099
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,126
he got better as the year went on.

1100
00:44:18,126 --> 00:44:19,666
If he can overcome a knee injury,

1101
00:44:19,666 --> 00:44:23,279
he's gonna turn into being
a good NFL running back.

1102
00:44:23,279 --> 00:44:25,435
But, Tom Brady, it starts with him.

1103
00:44:25,435 --> 00:44:27,754
- You know, Mike, I'm so
disappointed in you right now.

1104
00:44:27,754 --> 00:44:29,533
- You know why, you left off my

1105
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:31,232
Minnesota Vikings right here.

1106
00:44:31,232 --> 00:44:33,733
I don't know why you don't
believe in Kirk Cousins.

1107
00:44:33,733 --> 00:44:35,855
Obviously, this might be
the best duo in the league

1108
00:44:35,855 --> 00:44:38,688
in Adam Thielen, and Stefon Diggs.

1109
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:42,497
What is up with the hate
against the Minnesota Vikings?

1110
00:44:42,497 --> 00:44:44,210
You need to explain yourself to all

1111
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:46,776
the purple people-eaters out there.

1112
00:44:46,776 --> 00:44:48,307
- I watched the tape, that's why.

1113
00:44:48,307 --> 00:44:50,445
(laughing)
- Whoa!

1114
00:44:50,445 --> 00:44:52,096
- All right, all right.

1115
00:44:52,096 --> 00:44:53,026
- That is a good group.

1116
00:44:53,026 --> 00:44:55,134
I'm not saying it's not
likewise with Pittsburgh,

1117
00:44:55,134 --> 00:44:56,464
and obviously Kansas City.

1118
00:44:56,464 --> 00:44:58,668
These are all good, but
you're talking about

1119
00:44:58,668 --> 00:45:00,312
a Hall of Fame quarterback in Tom Brady,

1120
00:45:00,312 --> 00:45:02,043
Hall of Fame quarterback in Drew Brees.

1121
00:45:02,043 --> 00:45:04,453
You look at Dallas, look, Matt Ryan,

1122
00:45:04,453 --> 00:45:07,423
certainly has a Hall of
Fame credentials, possibly.

1123
00:45:07,423 --> 00:45:11,548
And I think that five
is a really high-level.

1124
00:45:11,548 --> 00:45:13,790
Nothing to be ashamed of over
here, but not in the top five.

1125
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:15,571
- Do you think that if Dalvin Cook

1126
00:45:15,571 --> 00:45:17,143
is a healthy running back this year,

1127
00:45:17,143 --> 00:45:18,384
he could be good enough to put them

1128
00:45:18,384 --> 00:45:19,888
in this kind of category?

1129
00:45:19,888 --> 00:45:20,921
- Boy, that's a really good question.

1130
00:45:20,921 --> 00:45:23,030
I think Dalvin Cook is a game-changer.

1131
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:25,817
Kirk Cousins is at best
with a good running game,

1132
00:45:25,817 --> 00:45:27,714
good offensive line, play action.

1133
00:45:27,714 --> 00:45:29,573
And Dalvin Cook could hopefully not only

1134
00:45:29,573 --> 00:45:32,520
help the running game,
but their passing game.

1135
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,013
- Those are our big threes.

1136
00:45:34,013 --> 00:45:35,882
Still nothing on Kawhi,
sorry, we'll let you know

1137
00:45:35,882 --> 00:45:38,567
if we hear anything, but in the meantime,

1138
00:45:38,567 --> 00:45:41,362
we're gonna talk to Browns
tight end, David Njoku,

1139
00:45:41,362 --> 00:45:45,395
about all the good stuff coming
up this year in Cleveland.

1140
00:45:45,395 --> 00:45:48,145
(exciting music)

1141
00:45:52,281 --> 00:45:55,686
(somber piano music)

1142
00:45:55,686 --> 00:45:57,266
- What's up DK?

1143
00:45:57,266 --> 00:46:00,628
I know you're asking
yourself, am I worth the hype?

1144
00:46:00,628 --> 00:46:01,688
- [Announcer] Are you kidding me?

1145
00:46:01,688 --> 00:46:02,971
Why we love the combine.

1146
00:46:02,971 --> 00:46:04,569
- Can I live up to it all?

1147
00:46:04,569 --> 00:46:07,139
See, that's the thing about hype.

1148
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:09,840
It can make you, or break you.

1149
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,776
And here's what I've learned,

1150
00:46:11,776 --> 00:46:13,767
they get to ask all the questions,

1151
00:46:13,767 --> 00:46:15,475
but only you get to answer.

1152

00:46:19,572 --> 00:46:21,572

1163
00:46:50,922 --> 00:46:51,755
- Are you?

1164
00:46:53,131 --> 00:46:58,131

- I wish for a Biggie Bag from Wendy's.

1168
00:47:10,324 --> 00:47:13,433
- I wish everyone loves
each other, and was all--

1169
00:47:13,433 --> 00:47:15,254
- That was a great wish, Jimmy.

1232
00:49:24,238 --> 00:49:25,653
- Breaking news into NFL Live.

1233
00:49:25,653 --> 00:49:28,526
Cowboys running back, Ezekiel
Elliott has been informed

1234
00:49:28,526 --> 00:49:31,268
he will not be suspended for his role

1235
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:33,478
in that recent altercation in Las Vegas

1236
00:49:33,478 --> 00:49:34,925
with the security guard that we discussed

1237
00:49:34,925 --> 00:49:36,673
at the top of the show.

1238
00:49:36,673 --> 00:49:41,374
Elliott met with Commissioner
Roger Goodell yesterday,

1239
00:49:41,374 --> 00:49:43,200
and issued a statement last night

1240
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,542
about his involvement there, apologizing.

1241
00:49:45,542 --> 00:49:48,578
And we are now being
informed that he will not

1242
00:49:48,578 --> 00:49:50,246
face another suspension.

1243
00:49:50,246 --> 00:49:52,223
So obviously a relief for Ezekiel Elliott,

1244
00:49:52,223 --> 00:49:54,231
and for the Cowboys there.

1245
00:49:54,231 --> 00:49:57,387
- Yeah, absolutely, listen as
a veteran in the locker room,

1246
00:49:57,387 --> 00:49:59,341
this is exactly the
outcome that you wanted.

1247
00:49:59,341 --> 00:50:02,493
You want all your guys, all
hands on deck to be available.

1248
00:50:02,493 --> 00:50:04,976
This is an important year for everyone

1249
00:50:04,976 --> 00:50:06,959
within the Dallas Cowboys organization

1250
00:50:06,959 --> 00:50:08,417
from the head coach on down.

1251
00:50:08,417 --> 00:50:11,570
And obviously, maybe the
most important player

1252
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:13,816
for their team is going to be available

1253
00:50:13,816 --> 00:50:15,032
at the start of the season.

1254
00:50:15,032 --> 00:50:15,887
- [Dan] You surprised, Mike?

1255
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:17,644
- I was mildly surprised, because again,

1256
00:50:17,644 --> 00:50:20,967
the personal conduct
policy's standard is lower

1257
00:50:20,967 --> 00:50:22,793
than criminal conduct.

1258
00:50:22,793 --> 00:50:25,078
So, the commissioner could
have suspended the player,

1259
00:50:25,078 --> 00:50:27,200
especially because he's a repeat offender.

1260
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,326
And the fact that he
brought him to New York City

1261
00:50:29,326 --> 00:50:30,982
shows that it was significant enough

1262
00:50:30,982 --> 00:50:32,817
for a face to face meeting.

1263
00:50:32,817 --> 00:50:35,230
And look, at the end
of the day, hopefully,

1264
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:38,091
Ezekiel Elliott has learned,
and all these sort of

1265
00:50:38,091 --> 00:50:40,210
bumps in the road he's
had from off the field

1266
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:42,858
are in his past, because
he is a great player,

1267
00:50:42,858 --> 00:50:44,776
and by all accounts, he's
a good teammate as well.

1268
00:50:44,776 --> 00:50:47,178
So hopefully, he's learned
from this and he's moved on.

1269
00:50:47,178 --> 00:50:49,201
- [Dan] We talked earlier
in the show about the kind

1270
00:50:49,201 --> 00:50:51,181
of conversation you have with
a player in this situation

1271
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:52,534
if you're the front office.

1272
00:50:52,534 --> 00:50:55,141
Does the fact that he
isn't being suspended

1273
00:50:55,141 --> 00:50:57,575
change any part of that message or make it

1274
00:50:57,575 --> 00:50:59,105
even more difficult to deliver?

1275
00:50:59,105 --> 00:51:01,586
- No, you have to have a stern, direct,

1276
00:51:01,586 --> 00:51:04,332
and a very hard conversation
that your behavior

1277
00:51:04,332 --> 00:51:05,500
is not acceptable.

1278
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:08,444
And even though it didn't
rise to level of suspension,

1279
00:51:08,444 --> 00:51:11,437
it's still not conduct
becoming of a Dallas Cowboy.

1280
00:51:11,437 --> 00:51:14,796
And again, if I was in the front
office, making the decision

1281
00:51:14,796 --> 00:51:17,693
I would hit pause on
the contract extension.

1282
00:51:17,693 --> 00:51:20,636
And I would put my efforts and
energy into the good players

1283
00:51:20,636 --> 00:51:23,044
and the players that have
handled themselves the right way

1284
00:51:23,044 --> 00:51:24,991
off the field, starting
with the quarterback,

1285
00:51:24,991 --> 00:51:27,936
Dak Prescott, and their
receiver Amari Cooper.

1286
00:51:27,936 --> 00:51:30,546
So, hopefully, it's a lesson
learned for Ezekiel Elliott,

1287
00:51:30,546 --> 00:51:32,335
it doesn't happen again.

1288
00:51:32,335 --> 00:51:34,247
But if I'm the Dallas
Cowboys, I have to have

1289
00:51:34,247 --> 00:51:36,790
that conversation with him and
tell him what we're thinking,

1290
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:38,198
and why we're thinking it.

1291
00:51:38,198 --> 00:51:39,031
- Damien?

1292
00:51:39,031 --> 00:51:41,666
- Again, as a player in the locker room,

1293
00:51:41,666 --> 00:51:44,575
you just, this is what you wanted to hear.

1294
00:51:44,575 --> 00:51:47,300
That he's gonna be available,
and we can go out here

1295
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:48,425
and win some football games.

1296
00:51:48,425 --> 00:51:49,754
- But I mean, is there
anything to the idea,

1297
00:51:49,754 --> 00:51:51,914
like he's not being
suspended, so you still have

1298
00:51:51,914 --> 00:51:53,396
to sort of make sure that something

1299
00:51:53,396 --> 00:51:55,718
is learned from this, right, as a player?

1300
00:51:55,718 --> 00:51:57,674
- Well, I mean that's something
for the Dallas Cowboys,

1301
00:51:57,674 --> 00:51:59,950
maybe internally as an
organization they want to do,

1302
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:03,031
but for a veteran, don't
mess with my money.

1303
00:52:03,031 --> 00:52:06,048
That's my biggest thing
is when you're not there,

1304
00:52:06,048 --> 00:52:10,745
you affect my play, so let's
stay on the straight and narrow

1305
00:52:10,745 --> 00:52:12,623
so we can go out here and
win some football games.

1306
00:52:12,623 --> 00:52:14,018
- Not that this necessarily
ever happened to you,

1307
00:52:14,018 --> 00:52:16,540
but do you think being called
into the commissioner's office

1308
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:18,519
even if it doesn't result in punishment

1309
00:52:18,519 --> 00:52:20,212
is enough to get the message across?

1310
00:52:20,212 --> 00:52:22,237
- Yeah, it should be like a
Scared Straight, you know.

1311
00:52:22,237 --> 00:52:24,395
Like, you gotta fly
all the way to New York

1312
00:52:24,395 --> 00:52:26,737
to go talk to big bad Roger Goodell.

1313
00:52:26,737 --> 00:52:28,719
You would think like, okay, all right,

1314
00:52:28,719 --> 00:52:31,532
let me make sure I'm on the
straight and narrow here.

1315
00:52:31,532 --> 00:52:33,470
So hopefully, Zeke Elliott
has learned from this,

1316
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:36,079
and the Dallas Cowboys as an organization

1317
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:37,251
can move forward now.

1318
00:52:37,251 --> 00:52:39,411
- I think that's the part
that there's a lot of people

1319
00:52:39,411 --> 00:52:41,235
in the NFL community that
are surprised about it,

1320
00:52:41,235 --> 00:52:43,372
because that's what happened
the last time two years ago.

1321
00:52:43,372 --> 00:52:45,488
Got suspended, had to
go to the league office,

1322
00:52:45,488 --> 00:52:47,462
and you would think,
especially with the contract

1323
00:52:47,462 --> 00:52:50,228
on the horizon, that he would really try

1324
00:52:50,228 --> 00:52:51,874
to be impeccable off the field.

1325
00:52:51,874 --> 00:52:53,450
But again, hopefully he's learned from it,

1326
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:55,648
he can move on, and put this behind him.

1327
00:52:55,648 --> 00:52:57,633
- Lot of expectations for
the Cowboys this year.

1328
00:52:57,633 --> 00:52:59,167
Obviously, this clears the decks in terms

1329
00:52:59,167 --> 00:53:00,945
of one major concern.

1330
00:53:00,945 --> 00:53:02,745
They have some contract
situations to work through

1331
00:53:02,745 --> 00:53:05,334
as they head into camp,
but you see this as a team

1332
00:53:05,334 --> 00:53:07,787
that's primed for a real
serious run this time?

1333
00:53:07,787 --> 00:53:09,272
- I think the Dallas Cowboys can represent

1334
00:53:09,272 --> 00:53:10,467
the NFC in the Super Bowl.

1335
00:53:10,467 --> 00:53:14,899
I think this team, the way
that Dak Prescott played

1336
00:53:14,899 --> 00:53:18,052
after the trade of Amari
Cooper from Oakland,

1337
00:53:18,052 --> 00:53:20,528
the numbers speak for themselves.

1338
00:53:20,528 --> 00:53:23,015
Across the board, completion percentage,

1339
00:53:23,015 --> 00:53:25,466
yards per attempt, third down.

1340
00:53:25,466 --> 00:53:27,663
All those numbers were
significantly better

1341
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:29,163
with Amari Cooper.

1342
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:34,834
Doing a trade during
the season, so imagine

1343
00:53:34,834 --> 00:53:36,882
now in the offseason, obviously you've got

1344
00:53:36,882 --> 00:53:38,547
a new offensive coordinator
in Kellen Moore.

1345
00:53:38,547 --> 00:53:40,485
We don't know how that's
going to all work out,

1346
00:53:40,485 --> 00:53:42,171
but you think that he's gonna accentuate

1347
00:53:42,171 --> 00:53:44,875
all the different aspects of Dak's game.

1348
00:53:44,875 --> 00:53:48,292
This offense, this team in general to me,

1349
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:52,210
is one of the better teams in
the National Football League.

1350
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:54,009
- [Dan] Only three teams in
the league have won more games

1351
00:53:54,009 --> 00:53:56,015
than the Cowboys have
over the last three years.

1352
00:53:56,015 --> 00:53:58,805
That's the Chiefs, the
Patriots, and the Steelers.

1353
00:53:58,805 --> 00:53:59,865
That's pretty good company.

1354
00:53:59,865 --> 00:54:01,450
- Yeah, and again, I
don't think Dak Prescott

1355
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:04,374
gets enough credit,
he's 32-16 as a starter.

1356
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:07,504
The ultimate measure of a
quarterback is win-loss record.

1357
00:54:07,504 --> 00:54:10,386
And you go back to last
year, he had a pass rating

1358
00:54:10,386 --> 00:54:13,199
of 122 on play action plays.

1359
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:15,766
So, it shows you the
importance of Ezekiel Elliott's

1360
00:54:15,766 --> 00:54:17,520
availability, as you mentioned, Damien.

1361
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,883
So, depending on the
health of Carson Wentz,

1362
00:54:19,883 --> 00:54:22,630
I think Dallas has a
really reasonable chance

1363
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:24,158
of winning this division.

1364
00:54:24,158 --> 00:54:26,070
Over the last couple
of years, Philadelphia

1365
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:28,820
has done such a good job of
having depth behind Wentz

1366
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:29,766
with Nick Foles.

1367
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:32,152
Foles isn't there anymore,
Nate Sudfeld is going

1368
00:54:32,152 --> 00:54:33,840
to be their presumptive
backup quarterback.

1369
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,631
So, Wentz has to overcome that issue.

1370
00:54:36,631 --> 00:54:38,473
Can he stay healthy for 16 games?

1371
00:54:38,473 --> 00:54:40,548
And you look at the way
Dallas has built this team

1372
00:54:40,548 --> 00:54:42,955
on both sides of the ball that I think

1373
00:54:42,955 --> 00:54:44,149
they'll be right there with Philly

1374
00:54:44,149 --> 00:54:46,128
going down the stretch here.

1375
00:54:46,128 --> 00:54:49,732
- So the NFL has released
a statement on this issue

1376
00:54:49,732 --> 00:54:51,845
regarding Ezekiel Elliott,
announcing that he

1377
00:54:51,845 --> 00:54:54,300
won't be suspended and it reads like this.

1378
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:57,131
"Immediately following reports
of an incident in Las Vegas

1379
00:54:57,131 --> 00:54:59,996
"in May involving Ezekiel
Elliott of the Dallas Cowboys,

1380
00:54:59,996 --> 00:55:03,012
"the NFL conducted a
comprehensive investigation

1381
00:55:03,012 --> 00:55:05,533
"that included interviews
with multiple witnesses,

1382
00:55:05,533 --> 00:55:07,512
"including security personnel and others

1383
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:10,305
"with direct involvement,
as well as a review

1384
00:55:10,305 --> 00:55:12,914
"of documentary and other information.

1385
00:55:12,914 --> 00:55:15,590
"On Tuesday, as part of the
review, NFL Commissioner

1386
00:55:15,590 --> 00:55:19,128
"Roger Goodell met with
Mr. Elliott to reinforce

1387
00:55:19,128 --> 00:55:22,052
"the standards of conduct expected of him,

1388
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:25,034
"and the consequences for
failing to meet those standards.

1389
00:55:25,034 --> 00:55:27,254
"Mr. Elliott acknowledged
that he demonstrated

1390
00:55:27,254 --> 00:55:29,707
"poor judgment and committed
to make better choices

1391
00:55:29,707 --> 00:55:30,743
"in the future.

1392
00:55:30,743 --> 00:55:32,832
"He volunteered to take
advantage of the resources

1393
00:55:32,832 --> 00:55:37,294
"available to him to help him
continue to grow personally.

1394
00:55:37,294 --> 00:55:39,207
"Commissioner Goodell determined
there was no violation

1395
00:55:39,207 --> 00:55:40,782
"of the personal conduct policy,

1396
00:55:40,782 --> 00:55:43,934
"and no further action is warranted."

1397
00:55:43,934 --> 00:55:46,094
So the statement confirming
what we were told,

1398
00:55:46,094 --> 00:55:48,395
any quick reactions there?

1399
00:55:48,395 --> 00:55:50,491
- He got lucky.
- He got lucky.

1400
00:55:50,491 --> 00:55:53,097
I mean, he could have
easily, he could've easily

1401
00:55:53,097 --> 00:55:55,347
been suspended again.

1402
00:55:55,347 --> 00:55:57,643
You know, Mike, you had
touched upon it prior,

1403
00:55:57,643 --> 00:56:00,096
but usually in these situations,

1404
00:56:00,096 --> 00:56:02,730
this is your second time going to New York

1405
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:04,506
to talk to the commissioner,
you've already been suspended

1406
00:56:04,506 --> 00:56:08,006
before and you get off with no punishment.

1407
00:56:09,843 --> 00:56:13,420
He's very fortunate to
be in this situation.

1408
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:15,536
- Something else that they
touched on the letter there

1409
00:56:15,536 --> 00:56:17,224
is that the league and
the union both deserve

1410
00:56:17,224 --> 00:56:20,105
a lot of credit for is the
resources that are available

1411
00:56:20,105 --> 00:56:22,446
to players, to coaches,
to staff in terms of

1412
00:56:22,446 --> 00:56:24,244
if you feel like you need help.

1413
00:56:24,244 --> 00:56:26,768
And there are a lot of
resources behind the scenes,

1414
00:56:26,768 --> 00:56:29,400
and hopefully if he needs
that, that he takes advantage

1415
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,780
of it and I know they
mentioned that in the letter,

1416
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:32,845
and that's an important aspect

1417
00:56:32,845 --> 00:56:33,854
of the collective bargaining agreement.

1418
00:56:33,854 --> 00:56:35,703
And that's an example of the partnership

1419
00:56:35,703 --> 00:56:37,818
between the league and
the union where they are

1420
00:56:37,818 --> 00:56:39,168
trying to help players.

1421
00:56:39,168 --> 00:56:40,768
- So once again, the news
on Cowboys running back

1422
00:56:40,768 --> 00:56:43,312
Ezekiel Elliott, no
punishment, no suspension

1423
00:56:43,312 --> 00:56:47,101
as a result of his most recent incident.

1424
00:56:47,101 --> 00:56:49,972
When we return on NFL Live, Alex Morgan

1425
00:56:49,972 --> 00:56:54,791
woke up social media after
casually sipping her tea Tuesday.

1426
00:56:54,791 --> 00:56:56,367
We'll show you some NFL celebrations

1427
00:56:56,367 --> 00:56:58,193
that Alex reminded us of.

1428
00:56:58,193 --> 00:57:00,217
- They want a show,
they're about to get one.

1429
00:57:00,217 --> 00:57:01,321
It's the T.O. show right now.

1430
00:57:01,321 --> 00:57:02,471
We got your popcorn ready.

1431
00:57:02,471 --> 00:57:03,576
Get your popcorn ready.

1432
00:57:03,576 --> 00:57:05,781
(stammering) That's all folks.

1433
00:57:05,781 --> 00:57:08,531
(exciting music)

1434
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:14,700
- Speaking here from the New York Times.

1435
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:17,200
(tense music)

1436
00:57:22,496 --> 00:57:24,926
- Hey, you see this?

1437
00:57:24,926 --> 00:57:25,759
- Holy.

1438
00:57:40,891 --> 00:57:42,334
- [Narrator] This is Payday bar.

1439
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:44,370
And there's only one thing
you need to know about it.

1440
00:57:44,370 --> 00:57:47,919
It has a truckload of peanuts
surrounding sweet caramel.

1441
00:57:47,919 --> 00:57:49,293
I mean, holy.
(drill buzzing)

1442
00:57:49,293 --> 00:57:51,129
Look at all those peanuts.

1443
00:57:51,129 --> 00:57:53,160
The best part is, it helps
you get through your day.

are brewed with real lime,
orange, and lemon peels.

1456
00:58:34,392 --> 00:58:35,381
Or maybe you can't,

1457
00:58:35,381 --> 00:58:37,320
but there are some firm context clues.

1458
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:39,820
(funky music)

1459
00:58:41,124 --> 00:58:43,555
- [Narrator] In every
trip, there's room for more

1460
00:58:43,555 --> 00:58:46,555
than just the business you came for.

1461
00:58:47,831 --> 00:58:50,036
Whether that's taking in every moment,

1462
00:58:50,036 --> 00:58:52,466
or capturing a moment worth bringing back.

1463
00:58:52,466 --> 00:58:54,799
That's room for possibility.

1464

- [Narrator] Feed your imagination.

1465

1467
00:59:04,217 --> 00:59:05,614
When heroes get hungry, they get

1468
00:59:05,614 --> 00:59:09,864
the $12 Extra Large Superhero
Pizza at Papa John's.

1469
00:59:10,927 --> 00:59:12,320
(doorbell rings)
- It's open.

1470
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,432
- Hi.

1471
00:59:13,432 --> 00:59:14,285
This is amazing.

1472
00:59:14,285 --> 00:59:16,581
- [Narrator] With moderate
to severe ulcerative colitis.

1473
00:59:16,581 --> 00:59:17,574
- Are you okay?

1474
00:59:17,574 --> 00:59:21,130
- [Narrator] Even when I was there,

1475
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:25,297
I never knew when my
symptoms would keep us apart.

1476
00:59:26,419 --> 00:59:28,580
So, I talked to my doctor about Humira.

1477
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:31,507
I learned Humira can help
get and keep UC under control

1478
00:59:31,507 --> 00:59:33,958
when other medications
haven't worked well enough.

1479
00:59:33,958 --> 00:59:35,828
And it helps people
achieve control that lasts,

1480
00:59:35,828 --> 00:59:38,572
so you can experience few or no symptoms.

1481
00:59:38,572 --> 00:59:39,768
- [Narrator] Humira can lower your ability

1482
00:59:39,768 --> 00:59:42,017
to fight infections,
including tuberculosis.

1483
00:59:42,017 --> 00:59:44,156
Serious, sometimes fatal
infections and cancers,

1484
00:59:44,156 --> 00:59:45,846
including lymphoma have happened,

1485
00:59:45,846 --> 00:59:48,251
as have blood, liver, and
nervous system problems.

1486
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:49,987
Serious allergic reactions and new

1487
00:59:49,987 --> 00:59:51,337
or worsening heart failure.

1488
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:53,449
Before treatment, get tested for TB.

1489
00:59:53,449 --> 00:59:54,867
Tell your doctor if you've been to areas

1490
00:59:54,867 --> 00:59:56,917
where certain fungal
infections are common.

1491
00:59:56,917 --> 00:59:59,980
And if you've had TB, hepatitis
B, are prone to infections,

1492
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:01,867
or have flu-like symptoms or sores,

1493
01:00:01,867 --> 01:00:04,165
don't start Humira if
you have an infection.

1494
01:00:04,165 --> 01:00:05,855
- [Narrator] Be there for you and them.

1495
01:00:05,855 --> 01:00:08,191
Ask your gastroenterologist about Humira.

1496
01:00:08,191 --> 01:00:11,166
With Humira, control is possible.

1497
01:00:11,166 --> 01:00:13,549
- The only thing we
love more than Slinging.

1498
01:00:13,549 --> 01:00:15,713

01:00:28,928 --> 01:00:31,785

1504
01:00:31,785 --> 01:00:33,902

it mean to be an American

1511

1513
01:00:50,849 --> 01:00:55,849
It means wearing white but
dream red, white, and blue.

1514
01:00:55,868 --> 01:00:58,908
It means being part of a
new generation of Americans

1515
01:00:58,908 --> 01:01:02,644
looking to light their
own Wimbledon history.

1516
01:01:02,644 --> 01:01:04,935
The story continues.

1517
01:01:04,935 --> 01:01:06,644

1537

Foundation for cancer research.

1538
01:02:11,691 --> 01:02:12,812
If you weren't with us
in the last segment,

1539
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:15,135
we did have breaking
news on Ezekiel Elliott,

1540
01:02:15,135 --> 01:02:16,591
the running back for the Dallas Cowboys.

1541
01:02:16,591 --> 01:02:19,952
The league has announced that
he will not face a punishment

1542
01:02:19,952 --> 01:02:22,817
for his role in a recent
incident in Las Vegas

1543
01:02:22,817 --> 01:02:24,143
involving a security guard.

1544
01:02:24,143 --> 01:02:25,593
The commissioner found he did not violate

1545
01:02:25,593 --> 01:02:30,593
the personal conduct policy,
so no suspension for Elliott.

1546
01:02:30,612 --> 01:02:35,177
Much more on that throughout
the day here on ESPN.

1547
01:02:35,177 --> 01:02:37,466
Big news yesterday in the
other kind of football

1548
01:02:37,466 --> 01:02:39,506
was the US Women's soccer
team beating England

1549
01:02:39,506 --> 01:02:41,670
in the semifinals of the World Cup.

1550
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:43,376
Since that team can't seem to do anything

1551
01:02:43,376 --> 01:02:45,418
without people finding a
reason to criticize it.

1552
01:02:45,418 --> 01:02:47,249
Part of the story has become Alex Morgan's

1553
01:02:47,249 --> 01:02:50,365
tea-sipping celebration
following what turned out

1554
01:02:50,365 --> 01:02:53,177
to be the game-winning goal.

1555
01:02:53,177 --> 01:02:55,294
The criticism seems to center on the idea

1556
01:02:55,294 --> 01:02:57,424
that the celebration was
directed at the opponent,

1557
01:02:57,424 --> 01:02:58,461
which was England.

1558
01:02:58,461 --> 01:03:00,736
But however you feel about
it, it got us thinking

1559
01:03:00,736 --> 01:03:04,143
about situations in the
NFL where people celebrate,

1560
01:03:04,143 --> 01:03:06,593
and kind of tailor their celebrations

1561
01:03:06,593 --> 01:03:09,010
a little bit to the opponent.

1562
01:03:10,537 --> 01:03:13,453
Week four, the year is
2000, 49ers and Cowboys.

1563
01:03:13,453 --> 01:03:15,207
Terrell Owens celebrates a touchdown

1564
01:03:15,207 --> 01:03:17,624
by posing on the Dallas star.

1565
01:03:18,542 --> 01:03:20,656
Was that aimed at the
Cowboys, I couldn't tell.

1566
01:03:20,656 --> 01:03:23,288
(laughing)

1567
01:03:23,288 --> 01:03:25,164
- [Damien] I love it, man, I love it.

1568
01:03:25,164 --> 01:03:27,157
- [Dan] 2018, Week 10, Dolphins-Packers,

1569
01:03:27,157 --> 01:03:29,206
Packers Robert Quinn sacks Aaron Rodgers,

1570
01:03:29,206 --> 01:03:30,668
and mocks him with the old

1571
01:03:30,668 --> 01:03:34,176
Discount Double Check celebration.

1572
01:03:34,176 --> 01:03:35,509
- [Damien] If you're gonna dish it,

1573
01:03:35,509 --> 01:03:36,766
you gotta be able to take it.

1574
01:03:36,766 --> 01:03:39,632
- Come home to roost.
- Right.

1575
01:03:39,632 --> 01:03:41,536
- [Dan] We got Baker Mayfield.

1576
01:03:41,536 --> 01:03:43,660
Oklahoma, this is college
footage of Baker Mayfield.

1577
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:46,360
Oklahoma-Ohio State, OU
defeats the Buckeyes,

1578
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:50,101
and Baker plants the OU
flag on the Ohio State logo

1579
01:03:50,101 --> 01:03:53,018
at midfield, again not real subtle.

1580
01:03:54,692 --> 01:03:57,595
2011 NFC Wild Card game, I
was there, Falcons-Giants.

1581
01:03:57,595 --> 01:03:59,865
Hakeem Nicks catches
a long touchdown pass,

1582
01:03:59,865 --> 01:04:02,867
and celebrates by doing
the Falcons signature

1583
01:04:02,867 --> 01:04:04,233
Dirty Bird Dance.

1584
01:04:04,233 --> 01:04:06,183
I thought Hakeem was too
young to even know that dance.

1585
01:04:06,183 --> 01:04:07,711
(laughing)

1586
01:04:07,711 --> 01:04:10,114
Did his research before
the game, I like that.

1587
01:04:10,114 --> 01:04:13,148
Week 10, 2012,
Panthers-Broncos, Von Miller

1588
01:04:13,148 --> 01:04:15,823
sacks Cam Newton and
does Newton's signature

1589
01:04:15,823 --> 01:04:19,785
Superman celebration.
(laughing)

1590
01:04:19,785 --> 01:04:21,541
Von, a little takeoff after that.

1591
01:04:21,541 --> 01:04:23,387
He practiced that.

1592
01:04:23,387 --> 01:04:25,747
- [Damien] That's right,
you go into these games,

1593
01:04:25,747 --> 01:04:27,562
you have them dialed up ready to go.

1594
01:04:27,562 --> 01:04:29,194
- [Mike] Oh, yeah got
a little strut there.

1595
01:04:29,194 --> 01:04:30,882
- [Damien] That's right, that's right.

1596
01:04:30,882 --> 01:04:32,097
- How about TO again?

1597
01:04:32,097 --> 01:04:34,683
Week 8, 2004, Eagles-Ravens,
Terrell Owens catches

1598
01:04:34,683 --> 01:04:37,253
a touchdown pass, then celebrates

1599
01:04:37,253 --> 01:04:41,308
with Ray Lewis's signature pregame dance.

1600
01:04:41,308 --> 01:04:43,343
- [Mike] Oh he got it, oh that's good.

1601
01:04:43,343 --> 01:04:44,591
- [Damien] I love TO, man.

1602
01:04:44,591 --> 01:04:45,711
- [Dan] Impersonated it before,

1603
01:04:45,711 --> 01:04:47,244
but that's as good as it gets.

1604
01:04:47,244 --> 01:04:48,912
- [Damien] If you don't
wanna see him do it,

1605
01:04:48,912 --> 01:04:51,370
then you better stop him, I always say.

1606
01:04:51,370 --> 01:04:53,260
- You know he practiced that.
- Of course.

1607
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:56,165
Listen, that stuff, while
you front office guys

1608
01:04:56,165 --> 01:04:58,145
are up in your office or whatever,

1609
01:04:58,145 --> 01:04:59,541
these guys are sitting in the locker room,

1610
01:04:59,541 --> 01:05:02,084
they're thinking of all types
of things to do on gameday,

1611
01:05:02,084 --> 01:05:03,925
so I love it, man.

1612
01:05:03,925 --> 01:05:04,766
- [Dan] Did you know that's what they were

1613
01:05:04,766 --> 01:05:06,370
doing down there while
you were in your office?

1614
01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:09,208
- They were studying film?

1615
01:05:09,208 --> 01:05:11,250
- Come on, man, don't be a lame.

1616
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:12,914
Look, we're trying to have fun out here.

1617
01:05:12,914 --> 01:05:15,276
This is a sport, we're trying to have fun.

1618
01:05:15,276 --> 01:05:18,222
- Look, the NFL has allowed
some celebrations recently,

1619
01:05:18,222 --> 01:05:20,625
but they still don't like the
direct taunting of opponents.

1620
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:22,042
Where's the line?

1621
01:05:23,492 --> 01:05:27,275
- (sighs) Listen, for me it's competition.

1622
01:05:27,275 --> 01:05:28,581
It's competition for me.

1623
01:05:28,581 --> 01:05:30,954
I know everyone's gonna
talk about sportsmanship.

1624
01:05:30,954 --> 01:05:33,489
Obviously, I'm a proponent
of sportsmanship,

1625
01:05:33,489 --> 01:05:35,728
but I've always been under the impression

1626
01:05:35,728 --> 01:05:38,088
that if you don't want
people to celebrate,

1627
01:05:38,088 --> 01:05:41,061
if you don't want people
to talk trash, stop them.

1628
01:05:41,061 --> 01:05:43,741
Stop them, plain and simple.

1629
01:05:43,741 --> 01:05:44,619
- Oh man.

1630
01:05:44,619 --> 01:05:47,838
- And for me, you know when
they celebrate as a team,

1631
01:05:47,838 --> 01:05:49,232
it's great, and the last couple of years,

1632
01:05:49,232 --> 01:05:51,642
there have been some very
creative celebrations.

1633
01:05:51,642 --> 01:05:54,432
Last year, going back to the
Steelers they're bench pressing

1634
01:05:54,432 --> 01:05:57,607
so to me when it's the
team, I'm all for it.

1635
01:05:57,607 --> 01:05:59,227
- Spoken like a true general manager.

1636
01:05:59,227 --> 01:06:00,845
(laughing)

1637
01:06:00,845 --> 01:06:02,199
- Up in his office while you guys are all

1638
01:06:02,199 --> 01:06:04,697
practicing your celebrations
in the locker room.

1639
01:06:04,697 --> 01:06:06,408
Coming up on NFL Live,
we're gonna have much more

1640
01:06:06,408 --> 01:06:08,931
on the Ezekiel Elliott situation.

1641
01:06:08,931 --> 01:06:11,493
Cowboys running back not
suspended by the league

1642
01:06:11,493 --> 01:06:14,533
after his recent meeting with
Commissioner Roger Goodell.

1643
01:06:14,533 --> 01:06:16,244
We'll come back and
talk about it some more,

1644
01:06:16,244 --> 01:06:18,156
next on NFL Live.

1645
01:06:18,156 --> 01:06:20,906
(exciting music)

1646
01:06:24,278 --> 01:06:27,588
- Let me get this straight,
after a long day of hard work,

1647
01:06:27,588 --> 01:06:29,319
you have to do more work?

1648
01:06:29,319 --> 01:06:32,450
Everyday, you're nearly fried
to a crisp professionally.

1649
01:06:32,450 --> 01:06:34,476
Can someone turn on the AC?

1650
01:06:34,476 --> 01:06:36,359
No? All right.

1651
01:06:36,359 --> 01:06:37,801
Because there isn't any.

1652
01:06:37,801 --> 01:06:39,001
Here.

1653
01:06:39,001 --> 01:06:40,260

wouldn't have electricity.

1656
01:06:44,471 --> 01:06:46,406
Our hobby would be going to be early.

1659
01:06:48,566 --> 01:06:50,074
- It's time to get yours.

1662
01:06:59,619 --> 01:07:02,202
(upbeat music)

1663
01:07:03,382 --> 01:07:05,676
- [Narrator] Tecate, bold on the outside,

1664
01:07:05,676 --> 01:07:06,697
light on the inside.

1665
01:07:06,697 --> 01:07:08,207
(whistle blows)
- Not running.

1666
01:07:08,207 --> 01:07:09,614
Why am I "not running"?

1667
01:07:09,614 --> 01:07:11,673
Because the DQ Summer
Blizzard Menu's only here

1668
01:07:11,673 --> 01:07:14,377
for a few more weeks
with seven great flavors,

1669
01:07:14,377 --> 01:07:17,084
like new Sour Patch
Kids, and Brownie Dough.

1670
01:07:17,084 --> 01:07:20,012
(whistle blows)
- Not running!

1671
01:07:20,012 --> 01:07:22,213
- [Narrator] DQ, happy tastes good.

1672
01:07:22,213 --> 01:07:25,121
- [Narrator] The ant,
mindlessly marches on,

1673
01:07:25,121 --> 01:07:27,845
carrying up to 50 times its body weight.

1674
01:07:27,845 --> 01:07:31,267
It never questions the task at hand.

1675
01:07:31,267 --> 01:07:32,799
But this year, there's another more

1676
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:34,882
thrilling path to follow.

1677
01:07:36,216 --> 01:07:37,267
- Kids?

1678
01:07:37,267 --> 01:07:39,991

1679

1685

And the other times, you don't.

Living in your dad's
car, always on the move?

You played the hand you had,

01:10:24,063 --> 01:10:26,636
- Recapping our breaking
news today on NFL Live.

1736
01:10:26,636 --> 01:10:29,453
Cowboys running back
Ezekiel Elliott will not

1737
01:10:29,453 --> 01:10:32,529
face punishment for his
role in a recent incident

1738
01:10:32,529 --> 01:10:34,776
with a security guard in Las Vegas.

1739
01:10:34,776 --> 01:10:36,354
Elliott met with
Commissioner Roger Goodell

1740
01:10:36,354 --> 01:10:39,142
for a couple of hours Tuesday of this week

1741
01:10:39,142 --> 01:10:42,240
and was informed he
would not be suspended.

1742
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:43,997
The NFL released a statement explaining it

1743
01:10:43,997 --> 01:10:45,794
basically says that they
found he did not violate

1744
01:10:45,794 --> 01:10:48,770
the personal conduct policy, but they hope

1745
01:10:48,770 --> 01:10:51,107
that he continues to stay
out of these situations

1746
01:10:51,107 --> 01:10:54,845
in the future, Damien
what are your thoughts?

1747
01:10:54,845 --> 01:10:59,577
- Well I mean, my biggest thing
is does Zeke grow from here?

1748
01:10:59,577 --> 01:11:02,068
This is the second time going to New York.

1749
01:11:02,068 --> 01:11:04,688
First time was, I believe it
was a six-game suspension.

1750
01:11:04,688 --> 01:11:08,545
This time, obviously, he
got off with no suspension,

1751
01:11:08,545 --> 01:11:11,798
but you would think
that at this point now,

1752
01:11:11,798 --> 01:11:14,122
it's time for you to grow and mature,

1753
01:11:14,122 --> 01:11:17,557
and not put yourself in
compromising situations,

1754
01:11:17,557 --> 01:11:21,875
because again, as a veteran,
I'm depending on you.

1755
01:11:21,875 --> 01:11:24,073
Guys in the locker room
need all hands on deck,

1756
01:11:24,073 --> 01:11:26,811
so I just want to see
more growth and maturity

1757
01:11:26,811 --> 01:11:27,849
out of Zeke Elliott.

1758
01:11:27,849 --> 01:11:29,549
- I totally agree, and you
take that a step further

1759
01:11:29,549 --> 01:11:31,134
with the contract situation.

1760
01:11:31,134 --> 01:11:33,756
If he's behaving like
this without that big deal

1761
01:11:33,756 --> 01:11:36,118
that Todd Gurley deal with
$45 million guarantee.

1762
01:11:36,118 --> 01:11:38,772
You know from an organization standpoint,

1763
01:11:38,772 --> 01:11:40,562
what is he gonna be like
once he has that money?

1764
01:11:40,562 --> 01:11:44,418
So, not only do I have pause
for concern to doing a deal,

1765
01:11:44,418 --> 01:11:46,413
but if and when we get to that point,

1766
01:11:46,413 --> 01:11:49,332
now I really gonna make
sure that the structure

1767
01:11:49,332 --> 01:11:51,220
is appropriate where
we'll guarantee money,

1768
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:52,907
certainly if he gets
hurt playing football,

1769
01:11:52,907 --> 01:11:55,030
but beyond that, we're gonna
want to have the ability

1770
01:11:55,030 --> 01:11:57,533
to move on from the
player if there's a third

1771
01:11:57,533 --> 01:11:59,118
bump in the road in terms
of something happening

1772
01:11:59,118 --> 01:12:02,387
off the field, so he's put
himself in that position.

1773
01:12:02,387 --> 01:12:04,076
And again, he's had
some teammates that have

1774
01:12:04,076 --> 01:12:06,414
played very well, like
the starting quarterback

1775
01:12:06,414 --> 01:12:09,315
Dak Prescott and have handled
their business off the field.

1776
01:12:09,315 --> 01:12:11,925
So, he's done this to himself, so not only

1777
01:12:11,925 --> 01:12:14,541
would I consider pausing and
not doing a long-term deal

1778
01:12:14,541 --> 01:12:16,364
if and when we got to that point.

1779
01:12:16,364 --> 01:12:18,505
The structure of the contract would be,

1780
01:12:18,505 --> 01:12:19,989
I want the player to take the risk,

1781
01:12:19,989 --> 01:12:22,915
because as an organization,
if something else happens

1782
01:12:22,915 --> 01:12:24,401
I want to be able to cut the player

1783
01:12:24,401 --> 01:12:26,089
and not have to pay him any more money.

1784
01:12:26,089 --> 01:12:27,663
- That's a key point, if
something else happens.

1785
01:12:27,663 --> 01:12:31,153
He was warned the last time
when he was suspended in 2017.

1786
01:12:31,153 --> 01:12:33,217
And he seems to, as Damien said earlier,

1787
01:12:33,217 --> 01:12:35,205
maybe he got lucky this
time, because they certainly

1788
01:12:35,205 --> 01:12:36,464
could have suspended him again

1789
01:12:36,464 --> 01:12:39,681
under the personal conduct
policy, given that warning.

1790
01:12:39,681 --> 01:12:43,196
But this is a transcendent
player who has led the league

1791
01:12:43,196 --> 01:12:44,907
in rushing two of his three years.

1792
01:12:44,907 --> 01:12:46,950
Led the league in rushing yards per game

1793
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:48,306
the year he was suspended.

1794
01:12:48,306 --> 01:12:50,218
To get to the point where you release him,

1795
01:12:50,218 --> 01:12:53,684
that has to be a pretty
extreme situation, doesn't it?

1796
01:12:53,684 --> 01:12:55,661
- Well listen, we all
know how the league works.

1797
01:12:55,661 --> 01:12:59,313
The more talented you are as a player,

1798
01:12:59,313 --> 01:13:01,310
the more opportunities you're gonna get.

1799
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:05,906
And you said it perfectly,
he's a transcendent talent.

1800
01:13:05,906 --> 01:13:08,743
One of the best players
that we have in our league.

1801
01:13:08,743 --> 01:13:11,750
But again, if you're not available,

1802
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:13,825
what good are you to the team?

1803
01:13:13,825 --> 01:13:16,146
So again, you would
like to see Zeke Elliott

1804
01:13:16,146 --> 01:13:19,037
mature and get past these incidences

1805
01:13:19,037 --> 01:13:20,944
that we've seen from him.

1806
01:13:20,944 --> 01:13:24,444
The three years plus or whatever he's been

1807
01:13:25,343 --> 01:13:27,170
in the National Football League,

1808
01:13:27,170 --> 01:13:29,157
so he can help his team
get to where they wanna go

1809
01:13:29,157 --> 01:13:30,529
which is to the Super Bowl.

1810
01:13:30,529 --> 01:13:32,268
- That's right, the old
saying in pro football,

1811
01:13:32,268 --> 01:13:33,680
production equals tolerance.

1812
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:36,003
And because he's produced
such a high level,

1813
01:13:36,003 --> 01:13:37,659
there's been a high level of tolerance.

1814
01:13:37,659 --> 01:13:39,352
But at some point, that's gonna equal out,

1815
01:13:39,352 --> 01:13:41,976
and hopefully he can
learn from this, grow,

1816
01:13:41,976 --> 01:13:43,938
and put all this behind
him and help the Cowboys

1817
01:13:43,938 --> 01:13:45,945
try to win a Super Bowl.

1818
01:13:45,945 --> 01:13:50,130
- Ezekiel Elliott represents
the big NFL news of the day.

1819
01:13:50,130 --> 01:13:52,291
On ESPN though, we don't
limit ourselves to NFL.

1820
01:13:52,291 --> 01:13:55,751
Our next Canadian Football
League matchup on ESPN Plus

1821
01:13:55,751 --> 01:13:57,902
is tomorrow night, it's
a week four matchup

1822
01:13:57,902 --> 01:14:00,015
between the 3-0 Hamilton Tiger-Cats,

1823
01:14:00,015 --> 01:14:01,999
and the Montreal Alouettes.

1824
01:14:01,999 --> 01:14:03,616
Looking for their first win of the season.

1825
01:14:03,616 --> 01:14:05,866
That'll be at 7:30 Eastern.

1826
01:14:08,508 --> 01:14:10,908
- Everybody's gonna say that we could be

1827
01:14:10,908 --> 01:14:12,609
and should be Super Bowl contenders.

1828
01:14:12,609 --> 01:14:14,519
- Who wouldn't aspire to be the Patriots?

1829
01:14:14,519 --> 01:14:17,132
Who wouldn't want to be 11-5, 12-4 team?

1830
01:14:17,132 --> 01:14:19,299
- I want to get there,
so we can print that.

1831
01:14:19,299 --> 01:14:21,336
I want to get to be what the Patriots are.

1832
01:14:21,336 --> 01:14:23,115
- [Damien] The Cleveland
Browns are going from

1833
01:14:23,115 --> 01:14:24,771
the hunter to the hunted now.

1834
01:14:24,771 --> 01:14:28,130
- [Announcer] Oh, what a
catch by Njoku, touchdown.

1835
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:30,461
- I said I woke up feeling dangerous, son.

1836
01:14:30,461 --> 01:14:31,411
- I'm almost giddy.

1837
01:14:31,411 --> 01:14:33,742
I feel like a little kid,
the excitement that I have.

1838
01:14:33,742 --> 01:14:35,400
(screaming)

1839
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:38,888
- [Mike] They have no excuse
for not being a contender

1840
01:14:38,888 --> 01:14:40,545
in the AFC to go to the Super Bowl.

1841
01:14:40,545 --> 01:14:42,212
They have no excuse.

1842
01:14:43,941 --> 01:14:46,266
- Cleveland Browns tight end,
David Njoku joins us now.

1843
01:14:46,266 --> 01:14:50,166
Getting ready for a highly-anticipated
season in Cleveland.

1844
01:14:50,166 --> 01:14:52,841
David, we've seen some
of what you guys can do,

1845
01:14:52,841 --> 01:14:55,126
certainly individually,
but what we haven't seen

1846
01:14:55,126 --> 01:14:56,963
is Freddie Kitchens as a head coach.

1847
01:14:56,963 --> 01:14:58,950
So tell us, what's Freddie like

1848
01:14:58,950 --> 01:15:02,061
now that he's the head coach?

1849
01:15:02,061 --> 01:15:05,659
- Freddie's a great head
coach, I believe, you know.

1850
01:15:05,659 --> 01:15:09,140
He's a player's coach
if that makes any sense.

1851
01:15:09,140 --> 01:15:12,836
You know, he knows what it takes for us

1852
01:15:12,836 --> 01:15:15,453
to do what we have to
do, and we know as well.

1853
01:15:15,453 --> 01:15:19,597
We put everything together, and hopefully

1854
01:15:19,597 --> 01:15:21,675
good things will happen,
you know, so we'll see.

1855
01:15:21,675 --> 01:15:24,085
- Bringing some stability
to that situation this year,

1856
01:15:24,085 --> 01:15:25,769
and obviously last year there wasn't.

1857
01:15:25,769 --> 01:15:27,702
What was it like going
through that last year

1858
01:15:27,702 --> 01:15:30,811
with all the turmoil and the firings

1859
01:15:30,811 --> 01:15:31,981
and all that stuff that happened midseason

1860
01:15:31,981 --> 01:15:34,728
with the coaching staff
changes, how tough was that?

1861
01:15:34,728 --> 01:15:36,619
- Yes, you know it was a
bunch of turmoil, you know.

1862
01:15:36,619 --> 01:15:38,935
Obviously, having your head coach fired,

1863
01:15:38,935 --> 01:15:40,871
and your OC also fired.

1864
01:15:40,871 --> 01:15:44,247
It brought a lot of
questions and the curiosity.

1865
01:15:44,247 --> 01:15:48,632
But, I feel like as a
team and the players,

1866
01:15:48,632 --> 01:15:51,789
we took it upon ourselves to come together

1867
01:15:51,789 --> 01:15:54,311
and focus on how we have
to finish this year,

1868
01:15:54,311 --> 01:15:55,885
or this past year, strong.

1869
01:15:55,885 --> 01:15:58,779
And I believe we did just that, you know.

1870
01:15:58,779 --> 01:16:02,225
I believe this upcoming year
is gonna be real special, so.

1871
01:16:02,225 --> 01:16:03,849
- A lot of times players say that stuff,

1872
01:16:03,849 --> 01:16:05,211
the front office stuff, coaching stuff

1873
01:16:05,211 --> 01:16:06,739
doesn't have an effect in the locker room,

1874
01:16:06,739 --> 01:16:08,156
but were there hard feelings?

1875
01:16:08,156 --> 01:16:10,076
It seemed like when you
guys ran into Cincinnati,

1876
01:16:10,076 --> 01:16:11,862
Baker Mayfield, your
quarterback had some things

1877
01:16:11,862 --> 01:16:13,189
to say about the situation.

1878
01:16:13,189 --> 01:16:15,689
Was that a widespread feeling?

1879
01:16:16,624 --> 01:16:19,134
- There's no hard feelings
at the end of the day.

1880
01:16:19,134 --> 01:16:21,368
Everyone must understand
that this is a business,

1881
01:16:21,368 --> 01:16:22,807
and you have to treat it as such.

1882
01:16:22,807 --> 01:16:24,606
So, there is no hard feelings, you know.

1883
01:16:24,606 --> 01:16:26,432
Whatever happened
happened, it is what it is.

1884
01:16:26,432 --> 01:16:28,008
And now we're focused
on what we have to do

1885
01:16:28,008 --> 01:16:30,911
to reach our goal this year.

1886
01:16:30,911 --> 01:16:33,162
- Obviously, you guys
did not lack for talent

1887
01:16:33,162 --> 01:16:35,744
on the offensive side of
the ball to begin with,

1888
01:16:35,744 --> 01:16:37,884
but Odell Beckham established as really

1889
01:16:37,884 --> 01:16:40,477
one of the top receiving
options in the entire league.

1890
01:16:40,477 --> 01:16:42,278
What have you seen from him in terms

1891
01:16:42,278 --> 01:16:43,740
of what he's shown you on the field,

1892
01:16:43,740 --> 01:16:46,113
and what kind of teammate he is?

1893
01:16:46,113 --> 01:16:48,973
- Yeah, so Odell is an elite athlete.

1894
01:16:48,973 --> 01:16:52,217
We were actually all together yesterday.

1895
01:16:52,217 --> 01:16:55,300
Jarvis, Hollywood Higgins, me, Baker,

1896
01:16:56,605 --> 01:16:58,704
and a bunch of other guys,

1897
01:16:58,704 --> 01:17:02,464
Seth DeValve, Demetrius
Harris, Pharaoh Brown,

1898
01:17:02,464 --> 01:17:04,480
together working on timing and everything.

1899
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:06,885
So when it comes to us as a unit,

1900
01:17:06,885 --> 01:17:10,903
we're very dangerous is the word to say.

1901
01:17:10,903 --> 01:17:12,876
- Yeah, how about personal goals for you?

1902
01:17:12,876 --> 01:17:14,410
Obviously, you know, you're a young player

1903
01:17:14,410 --> 01:17:16,243
who's still growing in this league.

1904
01:17:16,243 --> 01:17:17,929
What do you look at and
say, here's what I want

1905
01:17:17,929 --> 01:17:20,116
to accomplish this year and going forward?

1906
01:17:20,116 --> 01:17:23,086
- As long as I feel that I gave it my all,

1907
01:17:23,086 --> 01:17:26,148
I work to my highest
ability, then I'm content

1908
01:17:26,148 --> 01:17:28,128
with this year.

1909
01:17:28,128 --> 01:17:29,480
I don't really have any numbers.

1910
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:32,065
I was messing around saying 20 touchdowns,

1911
01:17:32,065 --> 01:17:35,939
but honestly speaking, I just
want to have a great year.

1912
01:17:35,939 --> 01:17:37,783
We want to win as many games as possible,

1913
01:17:37,783 --> 01:17:41,431
and we want to, obviously, go
to the Super Bowl and win it.

1914
01:17:41,431 --> 01:17:43,727
So that's the big term goal.

1915
01:17:43,727 --> 01:17:46,159
- When you're looking
to improve your game,

1916
01:17:46,159 --> 01:17:48,137
is there something you're
specifically working on

1917
01:17:48,137 --> 01:17:50,479
this offseason that you're
trying to get better at?

1918
01:17:50,479 --> 01:17:53,664
- Oh yeah, of course, I
mean honestly speaking,

1919
01:17:53,664 --> 01:17:55,288
I'm working on all aspects.

1920
01:17:55,288 --> 01:17:58,393
I don't believe I've mastered anything

1921
01:17:58,393 --> 01:18:00,308
regarding the tight end position just yet,

1922
01:18:00,308 --> 01:18:03,014
so it's really just
everything I want to work on

1923
01:18:03,014 --> 01:18:06,661
to better myself as an
overall tight end and player.

1924
01:18:06,661 --> 01:18:07,831
- I wanted to ask you a personal question,

1925
01:18:07,831 --> 01:18:08,664
if that's all right.

1926
01:18:08,664 --> 01:18:10,429
You have eight siblings, is that correct?

1927
01:18:10,429 --> 01:18:11,547
You're one of nine brothers and sisters?

1928
01:18:11,547 --> 01:18:12,380
- Correct.

1929
01:18:12,380 --> 01:18:14,860
- Your older brother, Innocent, studying

1930
01:18:14,860 --> 01:18:16,141
to be a neurologist.

1931
01:18:16,141 --> 01:18:18,394
What kinds of conversations--
- Neurosurgeon.

1932
01:18:18,394 --> 01:18:19,609
- Oh, neurosurgeon, excuse me.

1933
01:18:19,609 --> 01:18:21,048
Even more impressive.

1934
01:18:21,048 --> 01:18:22,714
What kind of conversations
do you guys have

1935
01:18:22,714 --> 01:18:24,963
about football and the sort of dangers

1936
01:18:24,963 --> 01:18:26,712
of your chosen profession?

1937
01:18:26,712 --> 01:18:29,603
- Well obviously, he
understand as well as I do

1938
01:18:29,603 --> 01:18:31,709
that football is a dangerous sport.

1939
01:18:31,709 --> 01:18:34,894
I have two younger
brothers, Evidence Njoku,

1940
01:18:34,894 --> 01:18:37,802
he plays at Miami right
now, University of Miami.

1941
01:18:37,802 --> 01:18:41,042
And my youngest one, Charles
Njoku, he just arrived

1942
01:18:41,042 --> 01:18:44,811
at UCLA to start his summer
program as a receiver.

1943
01:18:44,811 --> 01:18:46,382
They both play receivers.

1944
01:18:46,382 --> 01:18:48,860
So, we all understand
that football is obviously

1945
01:18:48,860 --> 01:18:52,282
a dangerous sport, but at the
same time, it is our passion.

1946
01:18:52,282 --> 01:18:55,625
And we work extremely hard
to be the best we can be.

1947
01:18:55,625 --> 01:18:58,337
So my oldest brother,
Innocent, he understands that.

1948
01:18:58,337 --> 01:19:00,748
He loves our passion
for it, but obviously,

1949
01:19:00,748 --> 01:19:05,047
he's the one saying be
careful, make sure you're safe

1950
01:19:05,047 --> 01:19:08,334
and everything so yeah
that's pretty much it.

1951
01:19:08,334 --> 01:19:09,729
- I guess it can be handy to have somebody

1952
01:19:09,729 --> 01:19:11,615
like that in the family.

1953
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:14,929
- Yeah, I always tell him
that once the three of us

1954
01:19:14,929 --> 01:19:17,310
are done playing football,
he has to take care of us

1955
01:19:17,310 --> 01:19:20,549
in all shapes and forms,
so yeah it's all love

1956
01:19:20,549 --> 01:19:21,754
at the end of the day.

1957
01:19:21,754 --> 01:19:23,124
- Well hopefully, he
doesn't have much to do

1958
01:19:23,124 --> 01:19:24,568
in that regard.

1959
01:19:24,568 --> 01:19:26,548
- David, thanks so much for
joining us and best of luck.

1960
01:19:26,548 --> 01:19:29,066
- My pleasure, thank you very much.

1961
01:19:29,066 --> 01:19:31,411
- So if you're Baker Mayfield,
the Browns quarterback,

1962
01:19:31,411 --> 01:19:33,725
you have Njoku, you
have Odell Beckham Jr.,

1963
01:19:33,725 --> 01:19:35,418
you have Jarvis Landry at receiver,

1964
01:19:35,418 --> 01:19:37,669
along with Nick Chubb and
Kareem Hunt in the backfield

1965
01:19:37,669 --> 01:19:39,221
when Hunt's suspension is over.

1966
01:19:39,221 --> 01:19:41,899
Those five combined for
41 touchdowns last year,

1967
01:19:41,899 --> 01:19:45,185
and they also had 641 touches.

1968
01:19:45,185 --> 01:19:48,201
So I guess the big question,
a good problem to have,

1969
01:19:48,201 --> 01:19:50,341
is there enough to go around in

1970
01:19:50,341 --> 01:19:52,389
that Cleveland Browns offense?

1971
01:19:52,389 --> 01:19:53,564
- A lot of pieces.

1972
01:19:53,564 --> 01:19:56,899
You know, there's a great
collection of talent,

1973
01:19:56,899 --> 01:19:58,114
but are they a team?

1974
01:19:58,114 --> 01:20:00,250
And that's what's gonna
fall on Freddie Kitchens,

1975
01:20:00,250 --> 01:20:02,594
because the Cleveland
Browns are in a position

1976
01:20:02,594 --> 01:20:04,438
they haven't been in in a long time

1977
01:20:04,438 --> 01:20:06,193
where they are the hunted.

1978
01:20:06,193 --> 01:20:08,806
And it's a totally
different position to be in

1979
01:20:08,806 --> 01:20:10,357
going forward in the season.

1980
01:20:10,357 --> 01:20:11,755
They're gonna be on
primetime a lot this year.

1981
01:20:11,755 --> 01:20:12,588
- [Dan] They are.

1982
01:20:12,588 --> 01:20:14,657
- [Damien] Let's see
what they can do with it.

1983
01:20:14,657 --> 01:20:16,999
- [Mike] The one thing we
didn't see on that graphic

1984
01:20:16,999 --> 01:20:18,712
was the lack of experience
with their head coach

1985
01:20:18,712 --> 01:20:20,765
Freddie Kitchens, and I believe one day

1986
01:20:20,765 --> 01:20:22,456
Freddie Kitchens will be a head coach.

1987
01:20:22,456 --> 01:20:25,203
But one year ago, guys,
he was a position coach.

1988
01:20:25,203 --> 01:20:28,196
It's like learning how to drive
a car going 90 miles an hour

1989
01:20:28,196 --> 01:20:29,453
in the left-hand lane.

1990
01:20:29,453 --> 01:20:32,157
And in the division,
you have John Harbaugh

1991
01:20:32,157 --> 01:20:33,435
and Mike Tomlin.

1992
01:20:33,435 --> 01:20:36,712
Since 2007, Mike Tomlin
has the second most wins

1993
01:20:36,712 --> 01:20:40,606
in the NFL, John Harbaugh
has the sixth most wins.

1994
01:20:40,606 --> 01:20:43,910
So, from a coaching standpoint,
Cleveland is a distant third

1995
01:20:43,910 --> 01:20:45,157
behind those two rivals.

1996
01:20:45,157 --> 01:20:47,851
And how Freddie Kitchens
can meld that group

1997
01:20:47,851 --> 01:20:49,721
will be interesting to watch.

1998
01:20:49,721 --> 01:20:51,984
- Interesting to watch,
what we have coming still

1999
01:20:51,984 --> 01:20:53,312
on NFL Live today.

2000
01:20:53,312 --> 01:20:56,236
We're going to have more on
the Ezekiel Elliott situation.

2001
01:20:56,236 --> 01:20:58,354
Cowboys running back
not suspended by the NFL

2002
01:20:58,354 --> 01:21:00,923
for his recent incident.

2003
01:21:00,923 --> 01:21:03,910
And because tomorrow is Independence Day,

2004
01:21:03,910 --> 01:21:05,868
we're going to talk about the great

2005
01:21:05,868 --> 01:21:08,701
independent NFL plays of all-time.

2006
01:21:10,151 --> 01:21:13,152
Stick around to see what that's all about.

2007
01:21:13,152 --> 01:21:15,902
(exciting music)

2008
01:21:17,755 --> 01:21:20,704
(serious music)

2009
01:21:20,704 --> 01:21:22,608
- What's up Marquise, this is Juice.

2010
01:21:22,608 --> 01:21:26,441
Listen, it's not about
hype, it's about heart.

2011
01:21:27,723 --> 01:21:31,961
It breaks through walls,
and outruns demons.

2012
01:21:31,961 --> 01:21:32,959
- [Announcer] Showtime.

2013
01:21:32,959 --> 01:21:35,110
- It outworks everybody.

2014
01:21:35,110 --> 01:21:37,904
When they see that, they
ain't gonna know what to do.

2015
01:21:37,904 --> 01:21:40,220
- [Announcer] Lights, camera, action.

2016
01:21:40,220 --> 01:21:43,689
- The Baltimore Ravens
select Marquise Brown.

2017
01:21:43,689 --> 01:21:45,356
- Bless 'em, my boy.

2018
01:21:47,943 --> 01:21:49,584
- Dad, how do you get a job?

2019
01:21:49,584 --> 01:21:52,511
- Well, first you search
for one and that's terrible.

2020
01:21:52,511 --> 01:21:54,329
Send off your resume and wait,

2021
01:21:54,329 --> 01:21:56,270
and then if you're lucky

Hey, don't do that.

than just the business you came for.

2031
01:22:22,481 --> 01:22:25,813
Whether that's keeping up
with what you always do,

2032
01:22:25,813 --> 01:22:28,988
or training for something
you've never done before.

2033
01:22:28,988 --> 01:22:31,321
That's room for possibility.

- Look, make a wish.

2035
01:22:34,118 --> 01:22:35,897

each other, and was al--

01:25:46,492 --> 01:25:49,800
Once again recapping our
breaking news here on NFL Live.

2110
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:51,601
Ezekiel Elliott, the Cowboys running back

2111
01:25:51,601 --> 01:25:52,905
will not be punished.

2112
01:25:52,905 --> 01:25:55,738
The league found that he did not violate

2113
01:25:55,738 --> 01:25:58,574
the personal conduct policy in an incident

2114
01:25:58,574 --> 01:26:01,993
involving a security guard
in Las Vegas recently.

2115
01:26:01,993 --> 01:26:04,941
The NFL interviewed
Ezekiel Elliott on Tuesday.

2116
01:26:04,941 --> 01:26:06,759
They also spoke with his
girlfriend who was there

2117
01:26:06,759 --> 01:26:08,365
at the time of the incident.

2118
01:26:08,365 --> 01:26:12,372
And have determined that he
will not face punishment.

2119
01:26:12,372 --> 01:26:14,915
Guys, we've had a lot of
conversation about this,

2120
01:26:14,915 --> 01:26:16,894
but one real quick sort of wrap up

2121
01:26:16,894 --> 01:26:20,160
on the upshot of Ezekiel Elliott today.

2122
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:22,096
- You flirted with fire again, you know,

2123
01:26:22,096 --> 01:26:23,491
you've been fortunate.

2124
01:26:23,491 --> 01:26:26,733
Now it's just focus on
the upcoming season.

2125
01:26:26,733 --> 01:26:28,329
- And for the Dallas
Cowboys, this is a really

2126
01:26:28,329 --> 01:26:30,627
important day, let's get it wrapped up.

2127
01:26:30,627 --> 01:26:33,432
We put it behind us, it's before July 4th,

2128
01:26:33,432 --> 01:26:34,694
now we can get to training camp.

2129
01:26:34,694 --> 01:26:36,403
It's one less distraction to worry about.

2130
01:26:36,403 --> 01:26:38,900
And now they can focus on
the Philadelphia Eagles

2131
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:41,131
and trying to win the NFC East this year.

2132
01:26:41,131 --> 01:26:42,595
- Mike, thanks for the
help with the segue.

2133
01:26:42,595 --> 01:26:44,734
Tomorrow is, in fact, July 4th,

2134
01:26:44,734 --> 01:26:47,457
and it's called Independence Day.

2135
01:26:47,457 --> 01:26:48,954
So before you fire up your grills,

2136
01:26:48,954 --> 01:26:50,738
or dig your feet too far into that sand,

2137
01:26:50,738 --> 01:26:51,945
we wanted to take you through some

2138
01:26:51,945 --> 01:26:54,752
of our favorite independent
plays in NFL history.

2139
01:26:54,752 --> 01:26:56,038
These are plays where one guy did it

2140
01:26:56,038 --> 01:26:58,706
all on his own or independently.

2141
01:26:58,706 --> 01:27:01,394
How about Pat McAfee and the Colts 2014

2142
01:27:01,394 --> 01:27:02,434
against the Texans.

2143
01:27:02,434 --> 01:27:04,261
The kickoff, there's no
coverage at midfield,

2144
01:27:04,261 --> 01:27:06,251
so he recovers it himself.

2145
01:27:06,251 --> 01:27:09,321
- [Damien] That's a smart play
right there by Pat McAfee.

2146
01:27:09,321 --> 01:27:11,598
- [Dan] 2009, Bills-Titans
in the Hall of Fame Game,

2147
01:27:11,598 --> 01:27:14,342
Titans Punter AJ Trapasso takes the snap,

2148
01:27:14,342 --> 01:27:16,541
but it's a fake punt and
Trapasso's just gonna

2149
01:27:16,541 --> 01:27:17,920
take it all the way.
- Got some wheels.

2150
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:19,160
- [Mike] There is no
tackling in preseason.

2151
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:20,016
- [Damien] No.

2152
01:27:20,016 --> 01:27:21,364
- [Dan] How much fun did he have there?

2153
01:27:21,364 --> 01:27:23,977
Number eight, 1997 Vikings-Panthers.

2154
01:27:23,977 --> 01:27:26,158
Vikings quarterback Brad
Johnson throws the pass

2155
01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:29,695
but it's batted back to
him and sure I'll take it.

2156
01:27:29,695 --> 01:27:33,139
He's gonna run it right in
for a touchdown on his own.

2157
01:27:33,139 --> 01:27:34,423
Denny Green liked it.

2158
01:27:34,423 --> 01:27:36,581
- [Mike] Brad Johnson very
underrated career at quarterback.

2159
01:27:36,581 --> 01:27:37,618
- Absolutely.
- No question.

2160
01:27:37,618 --> 01:27:40,703
Number seven, Marcus
Mariota, this is the 2017

2161
01:27:40,703 --> 01:27:42,143
Wild Card Game, Titans-Chiefs,

2162
01:27:42,143 --> 01:27:43,967
I was there for that one too.

2163
01:27:43,967 --> 01:27:47,792
Mariota scrambles,
throws, but gets knocked

2164
01:27:47,792 --> 01:27:49,077
right back to him by Darrell Revis,

2165
01:27:49,077 --> 01:27:50,991
and he'll go ahead and score it himself.

2166
01:27:50,991 --> 01:27:53,668
Big comeback that day for Tennessee.

2167
01:27:53,668 --> 01:27:57,607
Number six, 2017 49ers against the Bears,

2168
01:27:57,607 --> 01:27:59,544
the punt and Tarik Cohen corrals it,

2169
01:27:59,544 --> 01:28:02,916
takes it from the 40
and he's not just gonna

2170
01:28:02,916 --> 01:28:04,763
let himself get tackled here, right?

2171
01:28:04,763 --> 01:28:06,248
- [Damien] I mean, he's
outrunning the coverage.

2172
01:28:06,248 --> 01:28:08,884
- [Dan] He had a plan and he stuck to it,

2173
01:28:08,884 --> 01:28:10,956
and look at this, it's
gonna pay off for him.

2174
01:28:10,956 --> 01:28:12,104
- [Mike] I'll tell you,
him and Jakeem Grant

2175
01:28:12,104 --> 01:28:14,261
are two of the most dynamic
players in the open field.

2176
01:28:14,261 --> 01:28:17,482
They're fast, they're quick,
and they're hard to tackle.

2177
01:28:17,482 --> 01:28:18,811
- [Dan] Speaking of fast.

2178
01:28:18,811 --> 01:28:20,056
(excited chatter)

2179
01:28:20,056 --> 01:28:22,197
How about Mike Vick, 2002 Falcons-Vikings,

2180
01:28:22,197 --> 01:28:24,356
tied at 24 in overtime.

2181
01:28:24,356 --> 01:28:26,314
Vick, play action, gets outside,

2182
01:28:26,314 --> 01:28:27,718
and no one's gonna catch him,
come on are you kidding me?

2183
01:28:27,718 --> 01:28:29,814
- [Damien] This is like a
walk-off home run right here.

2184
01:28:29,814 --> 01:28:32,404
This was it, this was the signature play.

2185
01:28:32,404 --> 01:28:33,846
- [Dan] The overtime game.

2186
01:28:33,846 --> 01:28:35,914
This is my personal favorite guy.

2187
01:28:35,914 --> 01:28:37,804
Number four, 1991 Cowboys-Lions.

2188
01:28:37,804 --> 01:28:40,505
The one and only Barry
Sanders rushing up the side

2189
01:28:40,505 --> 01:28:43,119
and somehow gets out of this mess.

2190
01:28:43,119 --> 01:28:45,008
Oh, they're just not gonna catch him.

2191
01:28:45,008 --> 01:28:46,316
- [Mike] Boy, you're talking
about stopping on a dime.

2192
01:28:46,316 --> 01:28:47,371
- [Dan] That's ridiculous.

2193
01:28:47,371 --> 01:28:49,320
- [Damien] I take it those
pictures are not in HD.

2194
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:51,372
- [Dan] No, definitely not.

2195
01:28:51,372 --> 01:28:53,786
Barry deserved it but it was too soon.

2196
01:28:53,786 --> 01:28:56,654
Deion Sanders, 1989 Falcons versus Rams.

2197
01:28:56,654 --> 01:28:58,026
He drops the punt but he recovers,

2198
01:28:58,026 --> 01:28:59,689
and he's gonna take it back.

2199
01:28:59,689 --> 01:29:02,866
This is his first punt return touchdown.

2200
01:29:02,866 --> 01:29:05,793
I do not know if he also played baseball

2201
01:29:05,793 --> 01:29:07,279
for the Atlanta Braves that night,

2202
01:29:07,279 --> 01:29:09,397
but I know he did at some point.

2203
01:29:09,397 --> 01:29:14,077
So, very versatile,
independent kind of player.

2204
01:29:14,077 --> 01:29:15,785
Deion Sanders, he's going all the way.

2205
01:29:15,785 --> 01:29:19,237
- [Damien] Oh, he's gonna
high-step it into the endzone.

2206
01:29:19,237 --> 01:29:22,484
Speed kills.
- On the independent plays.

2207
01:29:22,484 --> 01:29:24,804
Number two is a Super Bowl play.

2208
01:29:24,804 --> 01:29:27,181
Super Bowl XLIII, you remember
if you were a Steelers fan.

2209
01:29:27,181 --> 01:29:28,552
James Harrison against the Cardinals.

2210
01:29:28,552 --> 01:29:30,873
It's first and goal for the Cards.

2211
01:29:30,873 --> 01:29:33,394
Kurt Warner is intercepted
by James Harrison.

2212
01:29:33,394 --> 01:29:35,824
Yes, he's gonna, he's gonna
run it all the way back.

2213
01:29:35,824 --> 01:29:37,020
- [Mike] When he catches
the ball, you're like

2214
01:29:37,020 --> 01:29:39,061
there's no way he can score
on this, there's no way.

2215
01:29:39,061 --> 01:29:40,569
There's too many guys that should be able

2216
01:29:40,569 --> 01:29:41,492
to track him down.

2217
01:29:41,492 --> 01:29:42,620
- [Dan] Those Instagram workouts.

2218
01:29:42,620 --> 01:29:44,133
- [Damien] How do you let him tightrope

2219
01:29:44,133 --> 01:29:45,964
the sideline like that?

2220
01:29:45,964 --> 01:29:48,172
Man, that's awful.
- Just push him out.

2221
01:29:48,172 --> 01:29:50,868
- [Dan] Big guy, though,
kind of hard to push him out.

2222
01:29:50,868 --> 01:29:52,329
Plus you've got like offensive linemen

2223
01:29:52,329 --> 01:29:53,235
trying to run him down.

2224
01:29:53,235 --> 01:29:54,068
- Oh.
- Oh!

2225
01:29:54,978 --> 01:29:56,305
- [Damien] Dan, what was all that about?

2226
01:29:56,305 --> 01:29:58,330
- [Dan] 2011 NFC Wild Card
Game, Saints-Seahawks.

2227
01:29:58,330 --> 01:30:00,442
Good offensive line work
here, but Marshawn Lynch

2228
01:30:00,442 --> 01:30:01,729
did a lot of this on his own.

2229
01:30:01,729 --> 01:30:05,578
Runs up the middle breaks tackles
left and right, stiff arm.

2230
01:30:05,578 --> 01:30:07,495
Beastquake, Beast Mode.

2231
01:30:08,862 --> 01:30:10,623
That was what a 7-9 Seahawks team

2232
01:30:10,623 --> 01:30:13,398
beating a defending Super
Bowl Champion Saints team.

2233
01:30:13,398 --> 01:30:14,231
- Yep.

2234
01:30:14,231 --> 01:30:16,233
- His balance for his size was remarkable,

2235
01:30:16,233 --> 01:30:17,543
he has incredible feet.

2236
01:30:17,543 --> 01:30:19,621
- Crazy, so those are
the independent plays.
