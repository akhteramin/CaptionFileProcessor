1
00:00:06,429 --> 00:00:10,012
(enthusiastic flourishing)

2
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:14,320
- It seems that television
has become a kind

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,050
of electronic confessional.

4
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,210
- It is juicy, newsy, exciting stuff.

5
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:20,043
- What are we doing here?

6
00:00:20,043 --> 00:00:21,750
Why did we start this business?

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,340
- Any tool for human
expression will bring out both

8
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,226
the best and the worst of us
and television has been there.

9
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:28,410
- [Announcer] Here's
Michael at the foul line.

10
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,460
A shot on Ehlo, good!

11
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,496
- They don't pay me enough to
deal with animals like this.

12
00:00:32,496 --> 00:00:33,329
(laughing)
- Why don't you just

13
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:34,410
get off my back, okay?

14
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,320
- People are no longer
embarrassed to admit

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,610
they watch television.

16
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:38,460
- Hello.

17
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,230
- People used to say, I was there.

18
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,643
Now they say they watch it on television.

19
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:45,393
(dramatic music)

20
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,588
(crowd cheering)

21
00:01:35,588 --> 00:01:39,450
- [Dick] Slowly but surely,
the 1970s are disappearing.

22
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,700
The 1980s will be upon us.

23
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,713
What a decade it is coming up.

24
00:01:46,969 --> 00:01:49,540
(crowd cheering)

25
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,170
Happy New Year!

26
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,030
- As you begin the 80s,
in the television world,

27
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,700
the landscape was, on any given evening,

28
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,480
nine out of 10 people were watching

29
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,481
only one of three networks.

30
00:02:02,481 --> 00:02:05,765
- More than 30 million
people are addicted toit.

31
00:02:05,765 --> 00:02:09,260
Social critics are
mystified by its success.

32
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,093
What is it?

33
00:02:10,093 --> 00:02:14,490
It's television's prime time
prairie pot boiler, Dallas.

34
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,110
- A move like that'll
destroy all of Ewing Oil

35
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,770
and it'll ruin our family name.

36
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,440
- I assure you, a thought like
that never crossed my mind.

37
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,003
- Brother or no brother,
whatever it takes,

38
00:02:23,003 --> 00:02:25,370
I'll stop you from destroying Ewing Oil.

39
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,320
- Dallas really did establish new ground

40
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,700
in terms of a weekly, one
hour show that literally

41
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,230
captivated America for 13 years.

42
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,500
- Dallas is a television
show which, in some ways,

43
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,480
is rooted in the 1970s,
and one of the crazy things

44
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,940
that emerges is this character, JR Ewing,

45
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,610
as a pop phenomenon.

46
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,280
- Tell me, JR, which slut are you going

47
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,470
to stay with tonight?

48
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,390
- What difference does it make?

49
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,090
Whoever it is has got be more interesting

50
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,900
than the slut I'm looking at right now.

51
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,080
- He was such a delicious villain.

52
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,080
Everyone was completely
enamored by this character.

53
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,373
- At this point, so many
people were watching television

54
00:03:01,373 --> 00:03:04,330
that you could do something so unexpected

55
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,440
that it would become news overnight.

56
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,410
- Who's there?

57
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,160
(dramatic music)

58
00:03:11,307 --> 00:03:13,949
(gun banging)

59
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:16,699
(dramatic music)

60
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:23,040
- The national obsession
in 1980 around who shot JR,

61
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,510
it's hard to imagine how obsessed

62
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,780
we all were with that question.

63
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,140
But we were.

64
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,330
- Who shot JR is about
as ideal a cliffhanger

65
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,160
as you possibly could get.

66
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,350
- Who did shoot JR?

67
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,310
We may never get that question.

68
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,280
The people who produce
that program are gonna keep

69
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,810
us in suspense for as
long as they possibly can.

70
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:45,020
- We shot JR and then
we broke for the summer.

71
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,690
Then, coincidentally,
the actors went on strike

72
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:51,310
and it delayed the resolution
and it just started

73
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,890
to percolate through the world.

74
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:57,670
- I remember going on vacation
to England that summer

75
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,035
and that's all that people
were talking about there.

76
00:04:00,035 --> 00:04:02,140
- [Jessica] We know you don't die.

77
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:02,973
You couldn't die.

78
00:04:02,973 --> 00:04:03,970
- Well, we don't know that.

79
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:04,880
- [Jessica] Well, how could you die?

80
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,420
You couldn't come back next season.

81
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,253
- That's what I mean.

82
00:04:07,253 --> 00:04:09,394
I couldn't come back, but
the show could still go.

83
00:04:09,394 --> 00:04:11,150
- [Jessica] Oh, but you wouldn't.

84
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,070
What is that show without JR?

85
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,422
- Well, that's what I figure!

86
00:04:14,422 --> 00:04:16,880
- Well, I guess if you don't know by now

87
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,317
who shot JR, you probably do not care.

88
00:04:19,317 --> 00:04:21,790
But last night, some 82
million Americans did

89
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:24,730
and they watched the much
touted Dallas episode.

90
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:27,754
It could become the most
watched television show ever.

91
00:04:27,754 --> 00:04:29,070
(gun banging)

92
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,250
- Who shot JR is a reflection
of old fashioned television.

93
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,390
It's a moment that
gathers everybody around

94
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:38,320
the electronic fireplace which
is now the television set.

95
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,530
- Now, about one special
American television program,

96
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,977
a critic said, "It
transcends in popularity

97
00:04:42,977 --> 00:04:46,030
"every other American
statement about war."

98
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,610
And something special happened today

99
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,915
to mobile Army Surgical Hospital 4077 that

100
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:53,090
will touch millions of Americans.

101
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,360
- It was the kind of event that

102
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,820
would draw the world's breath.

103
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,160
Stage nine, 20th Century Fox Studios,

104
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,620
the end of the Korean War,
the television version, MASH.

105
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,320
- It's been an honor and
a privilege to have worked

106
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,041
with you and I'm very, very
proud to have known you.

107
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,550
(dramatic music)

108
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:14,070
- There were those
landmark times when shows

109
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,280
that had been watched through the '70s

110
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,910
and into the '80s, like MASH,

111
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:23,530
had its final episode and we
were all sad to see them go.

112
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,880
- I'll miss you.

113
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,140
- I'll miss you, a lot.

114
00:05:27,017 --> 00:05:28,612
(dramatic music)

115
00:05:28,612 --> 00:05:31,560
- [Reporter] All over the
country, armies of fans crowded

116
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,810
around television sets to
watch the final episode

117
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,800
and to bid MASH farewell.

118
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,630
- The finale of MASH was unprecedented.

119
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:44,320
123 million people

120
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,330
watched one television
program at the same time.

121
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:51,540
- You know, I really should
be allowed to go home.

122
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,280
There's nothing wrong with me.

123
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,770
- When we ended the show,

124
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,020
we got telegrams of congratulations

125
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,973
from Henry Kissinger and Ronald Reagan.

126
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:04,720
The size of the response
and the emotional nature

127
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,730
of the response that we were getting

128
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:09,410
was difficult for us to understand.

129
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,230
- Who shot JR and the last episode of MASH

130
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:17,230
are the last call for the
pre-cable world of television.

131
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:22,460
It's like they are the last
time that that huge audience

132
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,410
will all turn up for one event.

133
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,470
(chopper blades whirring)
- TV is growing up with cable.

134
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,510
TV is growing up with content.

135
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:32,430
TV is growing up with different genres.

136
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,807
- The fundamental thing that cable did,

137
00:06:34,807 --> 00:06:38,420
the VCR did, or the remote control did is

138
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,270
it gave consumers more choice

139
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,238
and everything was about to change.

140
00:06:42,238 --> 00:06:44,988
(dramatic music)

141
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,010
- Dear Lexus.
- Dear Lexus.

142
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,920
- It is with a very grateful
heart that I write to you

143
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,790
about your amazing employees.

144
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:53,669
- [Male voiceover] Eric
volunteered to come

145
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:55,462
to my rescue that evening.

146
00:06:55,462 --> 00:06:58,290
- [Female voiceover] To a mom,
these things really matter.

147
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,320
- [Male voiceover] From this day forward,

148
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,190
I'm a Lexus customer for life.

149
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,023
Thank you.

150
00:07:02,023 --> 00:07:02,990
Sincerely--
- Ivy.

151
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:03,823
- Kim.
- David.

152
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,780
- Greg.
- Crafting every experience

153
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,820
for our guests with the same level

154
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,820
of care we craft our vehicles.

155
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,970
That's what makes Lexus Lexus.

156
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,603
Experience amazing at your Lexus dealer.

157
00:07:20,128 --> 00:07:22,350
- Budget meeting!
- Sweet!

158
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,662
- If you compare last
quarter to this quarter--

159
00:07:23,662 --> 00:07:24,495
- [All] Mmm.

160
00:07:24,495 --> 00:07:25,390
- [Announcer] It's no
wonder everything seems

161
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,420
a little better with the
creamy taste of Philly,

162
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,420
made with fresh milk and real cream.

163
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,460
It must be the Philly.

164
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,470
- The cells in your body work in harmony.

165
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,560
Like you, they get hungry.

166
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,990
Feed them with new Centrum Multi Gummies,

167
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,630

and women, 50 and over,

168
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,470
so you're ready for anything.

169
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,850
Centrum, feed your cells today.

170
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:48,713
- With tough food, your
dentures may slip and fall.

171
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,780
Fixodent Ultra Max Hold gives you

172
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,530
the strongest hold ever
to lock your dentures.

173
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:57,381
So now you can eat tough
food without worry.

174
00:07:57,381 --> 00:07:58,640
(lively music)

175
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,940
Fixodent and forget it.

176
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,537
- 145 over 92.

177
00:08:03,537 --> 00:08:05,970
- 180 over 111.

178
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:09,140
- I had a heart attack, a cardiac
arrest, and then a stroke.

179
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,260
- [Announcer] This is what
high blood pressure looks like.

180
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,830
You might not feel its symptoms,

181
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,780
but the results from a
heart attack or stroke

182
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,880
are far from invisible or silent.

183
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,180
Get back on your plan
or talk with your doctor

184
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,010
to create an exercise,
diet and medication plan

185
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,350
that works for you.

186

Go to LowerYourHBP.org.

187
00:08:25,163 --> 00:08:27,500
- If I would have
followed a treatment plan,

188
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,215
I would not be in this situation.

189
00:08:30,215 --> 00:08:32,300
- [Announcer] Do you have an idea for

190
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,120
an invention or new product?

191
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,180
Do you think companies would
be interested in your idea?

192
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,170
Do you wanna try to get a patent?

195
00:08:45,318 --> 00:08:47,270
- [Announcer] Take Prilosec OTC

196
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,240
and take control of heartburn,

197
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,270
so you don't have to stash antacids here.

198
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,103
Here.

199
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,320
Or here.

200
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,990
Kick your antacid habit with Prilosec OTC.

201
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:01,290
One pill a day, 24 hours, zero heartburn.

202
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,140
- Summer's not the time
for making bucket lists.

203
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,047
Bookers know summer is for booking it.

204
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,030
(bell ringing)

205
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:10,270
Like booking a beach
side resort and ordering

206
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,880
two more tacos than you need to, check.

207
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,650
Showing the deep end who's boss, check.

208
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:18,400
Starting a scooter gang
with the fam, check.

209
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,508
- Awesome.

210
00:09:19,508 --> 00:09:22,656
- [Announcer] Bookers know
summer won't last forever.

211
00:09:22,656 --> 00:09:23,563
- You're gonna thank me.

212
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:27,640
- [Announcer] So be a
booker at Booking.com,

213
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,467
the word's number one choice
for booking accommodations.

214
00:09:30,467 --> 00:09:32,850
(lively music)

215
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,480
- Discover new San Pellegrino Essenza,

216
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,730
a twist of Mediterranean flavors

217
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:40,380
with the gentle bubbles of San Pellegrino.

218
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,290
Add a twist of flavor.

219
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:46,176
San Pellegrino Essenza,
tastefully Italian.

220
00:09:46,176 --> 00:09:48,926
(dramatic music)

221
00:09:50,943 --> 00:09:52,590
(goat bleating)

222
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,061
- Thomas Magnum?

223
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:55,837
- Marion Hammond?

224
00:09:55,837 --> 00:09:57,203
- The private investigator?

225
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,860
- You're probably
wondering about the goat?

226
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,640
Just let me drop off my
friend and then we'll talk.

227
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,660
- When we entered the 80s,
a lot of one hour dramas

228
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:11,320
that were light hearted like Magnum PI

229
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,683
were very popular.

230
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:15,470
(tires squealing)

231
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:18,840
- After MASH went off
the air, the next season,

232
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,630
there wasn't a single
sitcom in the top 10.

233
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:24,740
First time that had ever
happened in TV history.

234
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:28,356
- The prevailing feeling was
that the sitcom was dead.

235
00:10:28,356 --> 00:10:31,860
- [Jeff] Brandon Tartikoff,
NBC programming chief says,

236
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,840
reports of the sitcom's death
were greatly exaggerated.

237
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,560
- Time and time again, if
you study television history,

238
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,120
just when someone is counting a form out,

239
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,330
that is exactly the form of programming

240
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,565
that leads to the next big hit.

241
00:10:46,565 --> 00:10:49,310
(lively music)

242
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:52,260
- So 1984, The Cosby Show comes on.

243
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,020
Now, Bill Cosby's not new to TV.

244
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,960
He's had other TV shows,

245
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,670
but The Cosby Show is very different.

246
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,360
It stands apart from
everything else he's done.

247
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,073
- Mom, I wanted my eggs scrambled.

248
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,202
- Coming right up.

249
00:11:04,202 --> 00:11:05,050
(audience laughing)

250
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,690
- They talked about parenting.

251
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:08,510
Previous to that, on television,

252
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,610
the kids were cool and
the parents were idiots.

253
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:14,370
And then Cosby says the
parents are in charge

254
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,150
and that was something new.

255
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:20,393
- Instead of acting disappointed,
because I'm not like you,

256
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,663
maybe you can just accept
who I am and love me anyway,

257
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,518
because I'm your son.

258
00:11:28,518 --> 00:11:30,090
(audience applauding)

259
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:33,430
- That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard in my life.

260
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,090
- It helps the casting
of anything helps a lot

261
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:37,410
in television and the
kids were just great.

262
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:39,730
- If you were the last
person on this earth,

263
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,010
I still wouldn't tell you.

264
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,690
(audience laughing)

265
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,506
- You don't have to tell me what you did,

266
00:11:44,506 --> 00:11:46,454
just tell me what they're gonna do to you.

267
00:11:46,454 --> 00:11:47,707
((audience laughing)

268
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,430
- Unlike every other show on TV,

269
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:52,970
it's showing an upper
middle class black family.

270
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,060
And this wasn't All In The Family.

271
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,290
They weren't tackling deep
issues, but that was okay.

272
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:00,300
The mere fact that they
existed was a deep issue.

273
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:04,360
- The decade was waiting for
something real, in other words,

274
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,980
unless it's real, it doesn't
seem like it moves anybody.

275
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,210
If someone's feeling something,

276
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:10,950
you get to the heart, you get to the mind.

277
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:13,150
And if you can hit the hearts and minds,

278
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,410
you've got yourself a hit.

279
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:16,080
- How was school?

280
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,923
- School, dear, I
brought home two children

281
00:12:19,923 --> 00:12:22,238
that may or may not be ours.

282
00:12:22,238 --> 00:12:23,490
(audience laughing)

283
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:28,490
- Cosby Show brought this
tremendous audience to NBC

284
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,663
and that was a bridge to us.

285
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,793
Our ratings went way up.

286
00:12:35,846 --> 00:12:38,110
♪ Sometimes you wanna go ♪

287
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:41,233
♪ Where everybody knows your name ♪

288
00:12:41,233 --> 00:12:44,290
- Even the theme song to
Cheers put you in a good mood.

289
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,250
- Evenin' everybody.

290
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,798
- [All] Norm!

291
00:12:46,798 --> 00:12:47,960
- Norman.

292
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,130
- What's shaking, Norm?

293
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,378
- All four cheeks and a
couple of chins, Coach.

294
00:12:51,378 --> 00:12:53,410
(audience laughing)

295
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,570
- By the end of the Cheers pilot,

296
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:58,177
not only did you know who everybody was,

297
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:02,620
but you wanted to come back
and see what was gonna happen.

298
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,860
It's like all you have
to do is watch it once,

299
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,490
you're gonna love these people.

300
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:09,430
These are universal
characters and the humor

301
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,080
worked on so many levels.

302
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,290
- Last night, I was up
'til two in the morning

303
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,379
finishing off Kierkegaard.

304
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:15,933
- I hope he thanked you for it.

305
00:13:15,933 --> 00:13:17,020
(audience laughing)

306
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,850
- You have to create a
community that people

307
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:23,690
are identifying with and Cheers
gives you that community.

308
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:26,280
- Boy I tell ya, I've
always wanted to sky dive,

309
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,990
I've just never had the guts.

310
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:28,860
What'd it feel like?

311
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,020
- Well, I imagine it's a lot like sex, ay.

312
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,965
Well, not that I have to
imagine what sex is like.

313
00:13:32,965 --> 00:13:34,680
(audience laughing)

314
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,830
But I have plenty of sex.

315
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:36,784
I have plenty of this, too.

316
00:13:36,784 --> 00:13:37,617
(audience laughing)

317
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:39,110
Why don't you just get off my back, okay.

318
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,720
(audience laughing)

319
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,450
- In the first episode,

320
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:46,450
there was a rather passionate annoyance.

321
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,893
I was saying, uh,
something's going on here.

322
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,330
A really intelligent woman

323
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:55,290
would see your line of BS a mile away.

324
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:58,190
- I've never met an intelligent
woman that I'd wanna date.

325
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,810
- On behalf of the intelligent
women around the world,

326
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:04,741
may I just say, phew.

327
00:14:04,741 --> 00:14:05,651
(audience laughing)

328
00:14:05,651 --> 00:14:08,160
- When we saw what Ted
and Shelley had together,

329
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,900
we said, oh no, you gotta
do this relationship.

330
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:16,660
- Ted and I understood what
they were writing right away.

331
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:20,140
- If you'll admit that you are carrying

332
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:23,750
a little torch for me, (audience laughing)

333
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,230
I'll admit that I'm carrying
a little one for you.

334
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:29,997
- Well, I am carrying
a little torch for you.

335
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,737
- Well, I'm not carrying one for you.

336
00:14:33,737 --> 00:14:35,150
(audience laughing)

337
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:39,550
Diane knew how to tease Sam,
Sam knew how to tease Diane,

338
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:42,220
and I guess we knew how
to tease the audience.

339
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,371
(hands slapping)
(audience laughing)

340
00:14:44,371 --> 00:14:46,340
- This incredible
chemistry between the two

341
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,290
of them ignited the show
and that's what drove

342
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:49,293
the show for the first five years.

343
00:14:49,293 --> 00:14:50,230
- What the matter?

344
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,760
- Oh, I'm devastated.

345
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,710
I need something expeditious and brutal

346
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,440
to numb my sensibilities.

347
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,808
Blast me into sweet oblivion.

348
00:14:56,808 --> 00:14:57,641
(audience laughing)

349
00:14:57,641 --> 00:14:58,474
- How about a boilermaker?

350
00:14:58,474 --> 00:14:59,594
- Make it a mimosa.

351
00:14:59,594 --> 00:15:01,200
(audience laughing)

352
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,980
- We had the luck to be
able to rotate the cast

353
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,900
and every time we put somebody in,

354
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,593
there were explosions.

355
00:15:09,986 --> 00:15:13,070
- Bwoah.
(audience laughing)

356
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:17,650
- There was something very
special about that setting,

357
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,500
those characters, that I never

358
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,220
got tired of writing that show.

359
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,640
- Sophisticated surveys,
telephonic samplings,

360
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,000
test audiences; all of those
things help to separate winners

361
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,670
from losers and make
mid-course corrections.

362
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:33,820
But you can't cut all comedies
from the same cookie cutters.

363
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,740
All you can hope is that every night

364
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,091
turns out like Thursday.

365
00:15:37,091 --> 00:15:38,847
- Yo, Angela!

366
00:15:38,847 --> 00:15:40,482
- Larry, Larry.

367
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:42,431
- Next. (gavel banging)

368
00:15:42,431 --> 00:15:44,764
- How rude!
(audience laughing)

369
00:15:44,764 --> 00:15:45,972
(cat meowing loudly)

370
00:15:45,972 --> 00:15:47,747
- He's quick, I'll give him that.

371
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:49,870
- All of television said, oh,

372
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:53,410
well, maybe the sitcoms are alive again.

373
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,400
And that's all that it
took, it took one success.

374
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,260
- A few years from now,
something new may tempt

375
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,940
the people who pick what we see,

376
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,700
but it's a very safe guess that whatever

377
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,310
gets hot for a season or two,

378
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:06,060
the men and women who create
good television comedy

379
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,967
will be laughing all the way to the bank.

the phrase too good for TV is often heard.

One recent network offering that seems

477
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:01,349

00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:11,390
- We had all watched a
documentary about cops

482
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:15,070
and it had this real hand-held,
in the moment quality

483
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:17,592
that we were very enamored of.

484
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:22,592
(people shouting)
(telephone ringing)

485
00:20:23,454 --> 00:20:26,040
- The minute you looked at
it, it looked different.

486
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,564
It had a mood to it.

487
00:20:27,564 --> 00:20:30,323
You could almost smell the stale coffee.

488
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,687
- We didn't wanna do a
standard cop show where,

489
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:37,950
you know, you got a crime
and you got your two cops

490
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:40,290
and you go out and you catch the bad guy

491
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:44,063
and you sweat him and he
confesses and that's it.

492
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,194
Cops have personal lives that impact

493
00:20:47,194 --> 00:20:50,770
their behavior in profound ways.

494
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:51,603
- Well, what about it?

495
00:20:51,603 --> 00:20:52,853
Is he here or is he out there?
- Just don't get excited,

496
00:20:52,853 --> 00:20:54,620
Counselor, we're working on it.

497
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,790
- How's this for logic, Furillo?

498
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:00,556
If he's not here and if he's
not elsewhere, he's lost.

499
00:21:00,556 --> 00:21:01,499
- We didn't say that, Counselor.

500
00:21:01,499 --> 00:21:02,486
- You've lost my client.

501
00:21:02,486 --> 00:21:04,600
Never in my entire life have I listened

502
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,560
to so much incompetence covered up by

503
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,000
so much unmitigated crap.

504
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,703
Find my client, Furillo, or I swear,

505
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,550
I'll have you up on charges.

506
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:17,280
- There'd be these ongoing
arcs for these characters

507
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,810
that would play out
over five, six episodes,

508
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,840
sometimes an entire season and in a way,

509
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,410
for certain stories,
over the entire series.

510
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,380
And no on had really done that

511
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,198
in an hour long dramatic show.

512
00:21:28,198 --> 00:21:30,403
- These past four months, I've missed you.

513
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,990
I had to find that out.

514
00:21:35,451 --> 00:21:37,650
Come home, pizza man.

515
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:40,160
- I think in the past, people

516
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,230
had watched television passively.

517
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:46,050
And, the one thing I think we did set out

518
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:47,503
to be were provocateurs.

519
00:21:48,745 --> 00:21:51,620
- The Eli Jackson report, you fill it out.

520
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,514
- What the hell's the
matter with you, man?

521
00:21:53,514 --> 00:21:55,470
- I'll tell ya something,
they don't pay me enough

522
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,948
to deal with animals like this.

523
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:58,406
The first thing they see is a white face

524
00:21:58,406 --> 00:21:59,754
and all they wanna do is dog ya.

525
00:21:59,754 --> 00:22:02,750
- Listen to me, Renko, it was a white face

526
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,902
that pulled the trigger, not a black one.

527
00:22:04,902 --> 00:22:05,760
It was a white one.

528
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,660
- It set a trend.

529
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,850
The idea that the audience
can accept its characters

530
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:12,150
being deeply flawed, even though
they were in this uniform.

531
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:15,350
I thought that that was
important to finally get across.

532
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,183
- Don't do that!

533
00:22:16,183 --> 00:22:17,016
No biting!

534
00:22:17,016 --> 00:22:21,370
- We wanted to make a show
that made you participate,

535
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:25,080
made you pay attention, and I
think that worked pretty well.

536
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,985
- And the winner is...

537
00:22:26,985 --> 00:22:28,250
(laughing)

538
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,857
- Hill Street Blues!

539
00:22:29,857 --> 00:22:30,690
(crowd cheering)

540
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:34,810
- We got 21 nominations and
we went on to win eight Emmys

541
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:36,510
and it put us on the map, literally,

542
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:40,420
and that's when people
finally checked us out.

543
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,010
- Programing chief of one of the networks,

544
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:44,790
he used to say to me about
shows like Hill Street

545
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:47,170
and St. Elsewhere, what
the American public wants

546
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:50,410
is a cheeseburger and what
you're tryin' to give 'em

547
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,350
is a French delicacy.

548
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,240
And he said, your job
is to keep shoving it

549
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,870
down their throat until after a while,

550
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:59,000
they'll say, that doesn't taste bad

551
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,780
and maybe they'll even order it themselves

552
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,142
when they go to the restaurant.

553
00:23:02,142 --> 00:23:04,040
- Nice of you to join us, Dr. Morrison.

554
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,120
- The success of Hill Street
Blues as a critical phenomenon

555
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,460
influenced everything that came after.

556
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,618
And then, of course, you saw
shows like St. Elsewhere.

557
00:23:12,618 --> 00:23:14,930
- Do you know what people cal this place?

558
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:17,920
Not St. Eligius, St. Elsewhere,

559
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,660
a place you wouldn't wanna
send your mother-in-law.

560
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,490
- When it first came on,
it was actually promoted

561
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,100
as Hill Street Hospital.

562
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,930
- You give your patients
the wrong antibiotics,

563
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:28,430
you don't know what
medications they're on,

564
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:31,540
you write the worst progress
notes, you're pathetic.

565
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,373
Pathetic!

566
00:23:32,373 --> 00:23:33,440
- Phil!
- What?

567
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,340
- Dr. Morey needs you right away.

568
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,550
- I'm sorry.

569
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:39,570
- St. Elsewhere broke every rule there was

570
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:41,963
and then built some new rules.

571
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,320
- Bobby, the bloodbank
called a little while ago.

572
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,350
They ran a routine panel
on that pint of blood.

573
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,553
The T cell count was off.

574
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:52,160
- They would have tragic things
happen to these characters.

575
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,840
There was real heartache
in these people's lives

576
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,580
and you really felt for them.

577
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,210
- I've got AIDS?

578
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:00,800
- Television at its best is a mirror

579
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,690
of society in the moment.

580
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:05,930
- St. Elsewhere challenged
people and it challenged

581
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:09,630
you as an actor, much less
the audience, to think.

582
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:13,280
The stuff they gave you was
extreme and what they did,

583
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,520
whether they were dealing
with AIDS or having

584
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:20,150
one of their main doctor
characters raped in a prison,

585
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:23,020
they tackled lots of difficult subjects.

586
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:26,220
- St Elsewhere was run
by people who were trying

587
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:29,100
to stretch the medium and in the 80s,

588
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,950
television producers were
encouraged to stretch the medium.

589
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:33,950
- Okay, clear.

590
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:38,300
- As the 80s got serious,
there was more drama,

591
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,340
they were getting a little
bit more adventurous

592
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:45,006
with the types of shows
that were getting a shot.

593
00:24:45,006 --> 00:24:46,268
- What are you doing?

594
00:24:46,268 --> 00:24:47,791
- I'm doing what I--
- Should've done all along.

595
00:24:47,791 --> 00:24:49,260
- What I wanted--
- To do originally.

596
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,990
- What I should've done--
- Last night.

597
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,570
Stop that, David!

598
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:54,103
- I'm calling--
- The police, David!

599
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:57,652
Hello, police.

600
00:24:57,652 --> 00:24:59,700
- [Maria] The networks realized there was

601
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,240
an audience looking for
something less predictable

602
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,123
than traditional prime time fare.

603
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,880
- Moonlighting was another of those shows

604
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,870
that said, okay, I see the formulas

605
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:09,930
that we've had up to here.

606
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:11,873
Let's do different things.

607
00:25:14,226 --> 00:25:15,440
(lively music)

608
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,510
- Hello.
- Hello.

609
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,110
We're looking a little
pale today, aren't we?

610
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:21,470
And who have we here?
- I don't know.

611
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:24,730
- Moonlighting was a
really experimental show.

612
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,220
They had a Shakespeare episode.

613
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,210
They had a black and white episode.

614
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:30,260
They did a musical episode.

615
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,200
They tried a lot of different stuff.

616
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,490
- I don't give a flying fig
about the lines in my face,

617
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:39,770
the crow's feet by my eyes,
or the altitude of my caboose.

618
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:42,280
- Well, I'm at a loss.

619
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,230
I don't know what a flying fig is.

620
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,772
- That's okay, they do.

621
00:25:46,772 --> 00:25:48,790
(crowd cheering)

622
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,235
- There's no trouble on the set.

623
00:25:50,235 --> 00:25:51,230
There is no trouble on set.

624
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:54,110
- Well, we have a very
volatile relationship.

625
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:56,095
There is a hate-love element to it.

626
00:25:56,095 --> 00:25:57,840
(angrily mumbling)

627
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,050
- The flirtations were great,

628
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:00,470
Bruce and Cybil were great.

629
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:03,310
Glen Caron kept them apart for a long time

630
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,740
and bravo to him.

631
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:08,690
- What they did was they took
the Sam and Diane dynamic

632
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:11,060
from Cheers and escalated it.

633
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,900
Cheers was will they or won't they.

634
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,070
Moonlighting was do they even want to?

635
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,670
- Stay away from me.

636
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:19,210
- Here I come.

637
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,370
- But I don't want you.

638
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,660
I never wanted you.

639

00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:42,120
he leads with the right
hand, there he goes!

800
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,925
- Tyson was made for TV
because there was drama.

801
00:32:44,925 --> 00:32:45,943
- [Announcer] It's all over.

802
00:32:45,943 --> 00:32:47,776
Mike Tyson has won it.

803
00:32:48,765 --> 00:32:51,960
- [Roy] Not a lot of junior
high school kids can dunk,

804
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,920
especially at five feet.

805
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,328
- But everybody tries, man.

806
00:32:54,328 --> 00:32:55,751
- (laughing) I bet, now.

807
00:32:55,751 --> 00:32:56,584
- Everybody tries.

808
00:32:56,584 --> 00:32:58,820
- I think that he is starting
to transcend just his sport,

809
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,820
that he's becoming something
of a public figure.

810
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,740
- Michael Jordan becomes the model

811
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:05,240
that every other athlete
wants to shoot for.

812
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,040
They wanna be a brand and that's

813
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,020
what television does for these athletes,

814
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,468
turns them into worldwide, iconic brands.

815
00:33:11,468 --> 00:33:14,180
- [Announcer] The in bounce
pass comes in to Jordan.

816
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,480
Here's Michael on the foul line.

817
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,299
A shot on Ehlo, good!

818
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:18,810
The Bulls win it!

819
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:22,220
- Athletes, in the 80s, became
part of an ongoing group

820
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,730
of people that we cared about.

821
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:25,973
We just had an enormous,
pent-up demand for sports,

822
00:33:25,973 --> 00:33:29,520
and the 80s began to
provide, thank goodness.

823
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,380
- Cable television is continuing to grow.

824
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,850
It's estimated that it will go

825
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:35,910
into one million more
US households this year.

826
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:38,750
- With cable television
suddenly offering an array

827
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:42,010
of different channel choices,
the audience bifurcated.

828
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:43,000
That's an earthquake.

829
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,100
- [All] I want my MTV.

830
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,060
- I want my MTV.

831
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,943
- I want my MTV.

832
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:52,680
(lively rock music)

833
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:56,510
- A new concept is born,
the best of TV combined

834
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:58,180
with the best of radio.

835
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:02,550
This is it, welcome to
MTV, Music Television,

836
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:06,880
the world's first 24 hour
stereo video music channel.

837
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,620
- Music television, what a concept.

838
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:12,700
MTV was pow, in your face.

839
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:15,385
You were not gonna turn us off.

840
00:34:15,385 --> 00:34:17,010
(lively music)

841
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:19,020
- MTV did nothing but play

842
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,500
current music videos all day long.

843
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,480
So let me get this strait.

844
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,023
You turn on the TV and
it's like the radio?

845
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,040
- I'm Martha Quinn.

846
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,630
The music will continue non-stop
on MTV Music Television,

847
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:33,350
the newest component
of your stereo system.

848
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:36,630
When MTV launched, a
generation was launched.

849
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:40,540
18 to 24 year olds were
saying, I want my MTV,

850
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:44,150
I want my MTV videos,
I want my MTV fashion.

851
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:44,983
- Yo.

852
00:34:44,983 --> 00:34:47,920
- MTV was the first network really focused

853
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,750
on the youth market and
becomes hugely influential

854
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,430
because they understand each other,

855
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:54,200
the audience and the network.

856
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:58,560
- MTV had a giant impact,
visually and musically

857
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,633
on every part of the TV
culture that came next.

858
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:04,357
- Freeze!
- Freeze, Miami Vice!

859
00:35:04,357 --> 00:35:07,415
(lively music)

860
00:35:07,415 --> 00:35:10,370
- Friday nights on NBC
are different this season,

861
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:11,880
thanks to Miami Vice.

862
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,880
It's a show with an old theme,
but a lot of new twists.

863
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,750
Described by one critic as
containing flashes of brilliance,

864
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:20,860
nonetheless, shot entirely
on location in South Miami,

865
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:23,643
the story centers around
two undercover vice cops.

866
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:26,800
- I don't know how this
is gonna work, Tubbs.

867
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:30,100
I mean, you're not exactly up my alley,

868
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,500
style and persona wise.

869
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,750
Heaven knows I'm no box of candy.

870
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:37,625
- Television very much
was the small screen.

871
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:40,840
What was interesting about Tony
Yerkovich's pilot screenplay

872
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,320
for Miami Vice is that
it was exactly not that.

873
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,340
Very much the approach was, okay,

874
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,477
they call this a television series,

875
00:35:47,477 --> 00:35:50,280
but we're gonna make one-hour
movies every single week.

876
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,420
- [Male Voiceover] Okay, here we go.

877
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,350
Stand by.
- And action.

878
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:54,480
- Police, police!

879
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,100
- [Jane] They were just
describing the show was sort

880
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,377
of a new wave cop show.

881
00:35:57,377 --> 00:35:59,600
- Yeah, it's a cop show for the 80s.

882
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:04,600
We use a lot of MTV images and
rock music to help describe

883
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,637
the mood and feeling of our show.

884
00:36:06,637 --> 00:36:07,470
(gun banging)

885
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:10,710
- In a lot of ways, you don't
get Miami Vice without MTV,

886
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,897
because in a lot of ways,
Miami Vice was a long video.

887
00:36:12,897 --> 00:36:15,403
The music was such a
big part of that show.

888
00:36:16,715 --> 00:36:20,120
- There was an allure to using great music

889
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,230
that everybody was listening to as opposed

890
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:25,868
to the routine kind of TV
scoring of that period.

893
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:34,690
- Not only was it not afraid
to let long scenes play out,

894
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:38,520
it would drag; a car going
from point A to point B

895
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,843
could be a four-minute Phil Collins song.

896
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,852

Otezla is not an injection or a cream.

958
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:06,030
It's a pill that treats differently.

959
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:09,460
For psoriasis, 75%
clearer skin is achievable

960
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:12,920
with reduced redness, thickness,
and scaliness of plaques.

961
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,340
For psoriatic arthritis,

962
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,690
Otezla is proven to reduce joint swelling,

963
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:17,800
tenderness and pain.

964
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,670
And the Otezla prescribing information

965
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:22,280
has no requirement for
routine lab monitoring.

966
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,250
Don't use if you're allergic to Otezla.

967
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:27,140
It may cause severe diarrhea,
nausea, or vomiting.

968
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:30,110
Otezla is associated with an
increased risk of depression.

969
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:32,120
Tell your doctor if you
have a history of depression

970
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,650
or suicidal thoughts or
if these feelings develop.

971
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:36,960
Some people taking Otezla
reported weight loss.

972
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,400
Your doctor should monitor your weight

973
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,580
and may stop treatment.

974
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:42,400
Upper respiratory tract
infection and headache may occur.

975
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,970
Tell your doctor about your medicines

976
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:45,990
and if you're pregnant or planning to be.

977
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:48,310
Ready to treat differently with a pill?

978
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:50,337
Otezla, show more of you.

979
00:39:51,292 --> 00:39:54,088
- This is nice.
- Yeah, yeah, this is nice.

980
00:39:54,088 --> 00:39:55,050
(chip crunching)

981
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:57,320
- Mm, how did you make the
dip so rich and creamy?

982
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,710
- Oh, it's Philadelphia--
- Family recipe.

983
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:00,623
- Can I see it?

984
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:02,960
- No.

985
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,023
- Philadelphia dips, so good,
you'll take all the credit.

986
00:40:08,897 --> 00:40:13,897
(car beeping)
(tires squealing)

987
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:17,830
- [Announcer] Life doesn't
give you many second chances.

988
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,709
(dramatic music)

989
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:22,170
(car beeping)
(tires squealing)

990
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,340
But a Subaru can.

991
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,710
- You guys okay?

992
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:25,703
You all right?

993
00:40:25,703 --> 00:40:28,080
- [Announcer] EyeSight
with Pre-Collision Braking,

994
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,890
standard on the Subaru Ascent.

995
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:32,460
Presenting the three-row Subaru Ascent.

996
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,183
Love is now bigger than ever.

997
00:40:36,425 --> 00:40:38,210
- [Announcer] Closed captioning brought

998
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:40,559
to you by Mesobook.com.

999
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:43,290
- [Announcer] Mesothelioma is all we do.

1000
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:44,210
For over 10 years,

1001
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:46,730
we have offered a free
book on Mesothelioma.

1002
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:50,123
Call 1-800-259-9374.

1003
00:40:51,774 --> 00:40:54,524
(dramatic music)

1004
00:40:55,403 --> 00:40:57,700
- In recent years, it
seems that television

1005
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:00,890
has become a kind of
electronic confessional

1006
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:03,180
where guests are willing to expose painful

1007
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,800
and sometimes embarrassing
aspects of their lives,

1008
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,580
quite readily, to millions of viewers.

1009
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,350
- At the beginning of the decade,

1010
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:14,060
we get the dominance of
Phil Donahue and that sort

1011
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:17,000
of a maturation of women's
issues and he seemed

1012
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,980
to talk to them in the audience,

1013
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:21,620
he seemed to talk to them
through the TV screen.

1014
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,614
- I'm glad you called; kiss the kids.

1015
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:25,090
(audience laughing)

1016
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:26,900
We'll be back in just a moment.

1017
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:30,096
- If you look at the
body of work we've had,

1018
00:41:30,096 --> 00:41:32,780
you're gonna see the 80s there.

1019
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,450
- I'm not here to say you're wrong,

1020
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,850
but let's understand this.

1021
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:38,860
When you bring a moral
judgment without knowing them,

1022
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:41,560
against them, for the way that they look,

1023
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:46,430
they feel that confirms the
reason for their rebellion,

1024
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:47,766
if that's what you wanna call it.

1025
00:41:47,766 --> 00:41:48,599
(audience applauding)

1026
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:52,240
- He really believed that
daytime television needed

1027
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,830
to talk about the ideas
we were thinking about,

1028
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:58,574
the issues we were concerned about.

1029
00:41:58,574 --> 00:42:00,490
- I don't wanna characterize his question,

1030
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:02,570
but why don't you get this fixed instead

1031
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:04,000
of doing this screwy stuff?

1032
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,920
- There's not a single
recorded case in history

1033
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,140
of any trans-sexual that ever,

1034
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:11,150
through psychological treatment, changed.

1035
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,710
It has never happened yet.

1036
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:15,090
- And we were putting
very important people

1037
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:17,580
on the program, all kinds of people,

1038
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,830
gay people, people going to jail,

1039
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:23,580
people running for office,
sometimes the same people.

1040
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:26,160
It was a magic carpet ride.

1041
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,040
You really do paint a
very, very grim picture

1042
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,720
of the sitting president
of the United States.

1043
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,540
- Let me just say this,
I think he's probably

1044
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,860
the laziest president that I've ever seen.

1045
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:40,090
- The audience for Phil
Donahue built and built

1046
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:45,090
and built and built and
led the way to Oprah.

1047
00:42:45,338 --> 00:42:47,921
(lively music)

1048
00:42:50,954 --> 00:42:52,256
(audience cheering)

1049
00:42:52,256 --> 00:42:53,089
- Wooh!

1050
00:42:54,097 --> 00:42:55,820
Hello everybody!

1051
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:56,653
Hello!

1052
00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:01,430
- Oprah has a particularly
magical combination

1053
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:05,000
of her own background, her own experience,

1054
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,764
her own incisive mind,
an empathetic spirit.

1055
00:43:09,764 --> 00:43:11,030
(audience cheering)
- Thank you,

1056
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:13,420
I'm Oprah Winfrey and welcome to

1057
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:15,575
the very first national
Oprah Winfrey show.

1058
00:43:15,575 --> 00:43:16,850
(audience cheering)

1059
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:20,770
- I was surprised at the rocket
pace that Oprah took off,

1060
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:22,850
because it took us a lot longer.

1061
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,250
The Donahue Show rearranged the furniture,

1062
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:28,041
but Oprah remodeled the whole house.

1063
00:43:28,041 --> 00:43:29,510
- There are a lot of
other people out there

1064
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:31,850
who are watching who
really don't understand

1065
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:34,350
what you mean when you
say, well, we're in love,

1066
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:36,000
because I remember
questioning my gay friends,

1067
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,127
saying, "You mean like,
you feel about him,

1068
00:43:38,127 --> 00:43:40,306
"the way I feel about--
(audience laughing)

1069
00:43:40,306 --> 00:43:42,930
- It's kind of a strange concept for a lot

1070
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:44,070
of people to accept.

1071
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:46,700
- Oprah was connecting
with people in a way

1072
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,980
that no one had on TV before.

1073
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:51,750
And it was really special to see.

1074
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:53,540
- Did you know that for the longest time

1075
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:56,350
I wanted to be a fourth
grade teacher because of you?

1076
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:59,900
- I was not aware of inspiring anyone.

1077
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:02,270
- I think you did exactly what
teachers are supposed to do.

1078
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:04,250
They create a spark for learning

1079
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:06,760
and that's the reason I
have a talk show today.

1080
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,840
- Oprah Winfrey now dominates
the talk show circuit

1081
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,490
both in the ratings and popularity.

1082
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:16,800
- I want to use my life as a
source of lifting people up,

1083
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,950
that's what I wanna do.

1084
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:19,910
That's what I do every day on my show.

1085
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:22,000
We get accused of being tabloid television

1086
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,800
and sensational and so forth,
but what I really think we do,

1087
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,480
more than anything else,
is we serve as a voice

1088
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:30,010
to a lot of people who
felt up until, perhaps,

1089
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:33,360
my show or some of the
others, they were alone.

1090
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,757
This is what 67 pounds of fat looks like.

1091
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:37,590
(audience chattering)

1092
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:38,970
I can't lift it.

1093
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:41,010
It is amazing to me that I can't lift it

1094
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:43,340
but I used to carry it around every day.

1095
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:46,780
- There's nothing more
endearing to an audience

1096
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:50,450
than to have that kind
of honesty and humility

1097
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:52,980
and courage on the part of a host.

1098
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:56,620
And that, I think, has a
lot to do with her power.

1099
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:58,360
- Feels like I can do some good here

1100
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:01,378
and I really do think that
the show does a lot of good.

1101
00:45:01,378 --> 00:45:03,961
(lively music)

1102
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:08,270
- American television is
drowning in talk shows,

1103
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:11,390
but it's never seen anything
like Morton Downey, Jr.

1104
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:14,160
- I wanna tell you this--
- Sit down and shut up!

1105
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,053
- Other competitors come and
take the television talk show

1106
00:45:17,053 --> 00:45:18,330
into two different directions.

1107
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:20,100
So you start seeing the phenomenon

1108
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,420
of daytime television shows becoming

1109
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,700
less tame and more wild.

1110
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:29,660
- The 80s brought a lot of
belligerence to television,

1111
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,750
whether it was Morton Downey, Jr.

1112
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:35,700
being the offensive characturish person

1113
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,670
that he was or Geraldo.

1114
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:41,760
He did his own outlandish things.

1115
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:42,780
- Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.

1116
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:45,920
We're gonna get into the mind
of another all-American boy

1117
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,600
who came under the influence
of Satanism and took part

1118
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,570
in a crime without passion or motive.

1119
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:52,980
- Geraldo Rivera takes
the power of the talk show

1120
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:55,680
to a whole other level,
trying to put people on stage

1121
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,510
who hate each other, who are gonna fight.

1122
00:45:57,510 --> 00:45:59,020
- In the case of the temple of Satan

1123
00:45:59,020 --> 00:45:59,930
and the church of Satan,

1124
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:02,639
we have not had any problems
with criminal behavior.

1125
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:06,510
- Yet, when you hear story
after story after story

1126
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:08,860
of people committing
these wretched crimes,

1127
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:11,650
these violent crimes in the devil's name--

1128
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:13,577
- The more tension there is,
the more conflict there is,

1129
00:46:13,577 --> 00:46:16,250
the more violence there is,
the more the ratings go up.

1130
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:18,007
And the American people
love to complain about it,

1131
00:46:18,007 --> 00:46:19,630
but they also love to watch.

1132
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:22,360
- Geraldo Rivera is back
in a controversy tonight.

1133
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,230
Rivera drew sharp criticism with

1134
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:26,860
his recent television
special on devil worship,

1135
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:29,610
but today, he found himself
in a real free for all.

1136
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:32,372
- I get sick and tired
of seeing Uncle Tom here,

1137
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:34,616
trying to be a white man--
- Go ahead, Troy, go ahead.

1138
00:46:34,616 --> 00:46:37,021
- Now--
- Sit down, guy.

1139
00:46:37,021 --> 00:46:40,188
(audience chattering)

1140
00:46:41,527 --> 00:46:43,814
- Hey, hold it, hold it.
- Sit down, sit down.

1141
00:46:43,814 --> 00:46:46,647
(crowd screaming)

1142
00:46:50,223 --> 00:46:52,270
- [Tom] Rivera suffered a broken nose,

1143
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:54,030
but he said the show
will be broadcast later

1144
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:55,903
this month in its entirety.

1145
00:46:57,217 --> 00:47:00,003
- That's not something I would have done,

1146
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:03,760
but there was a lot of hypocrisy.

1147
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,370
And one of the major
magazines put the picture

1148
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:09,000
of Geraldo getting hit
with a chair on the cover

1149
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,570
and the article said, isn't this awful,

1150
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:12,030
look what's happened to television.

1151
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:13,370
And yet, they couldn't wait to use

1152
00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:15,189
it to sell their own magazine.

1153
00:47:15,189 --> 00:47:16,837
- Let's go to the audience, all right?

1154
00:47:16,837 --> 00:47:19,090
I want to stick to you guys, you guys--

1155
00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:21,570
- Over the years,
broadcasting has deteriorated

1156
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:23,320
and now, in this era of deregulation,

1157
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,100
it's deteriorating further.

1158
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:27,770
- Give people light and they
will find their own way.

1159
00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:31,046
Relax; America will
survive the talk shows.

00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,370
- A family van?

1177
00:48:12,370 --> 00:48:13,730
Was that her choice?

1178
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:15,110
- Nah, man, that was my choice.

it's got a built-in vacuum cleaner.

You ever seen my kid eat crackers?

1182
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:22,713
- Yeah.

1183
00:48:22,713 --> 00:48:23,745
- See that, see how that works?

1184
00:48:23,745 --> 00:48:24,578

- I love that.

- Or maybe go surfing.

1213
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:26,213
Or not.

1214
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,440

one line from the script,

1221
00:49:38,357 --> 00:49:41,030
"You complete me," there
were times that I thought,

1222
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:44,350
is this too cheesy and I told Tom that.

1223
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:47,060
And he said, "Just give me a shot at it."

1224

with a wit and with the music.

1261
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:39,040
It was a brilliantly written
show and a great performance

00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:54,520
of growing up during one
of the most turbulent times

1269
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:55,600
that we have known.

1270
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:58,670
- Kevin Arnold is just like a regular kid,

1271
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:02,270
except in the 1960s and
he's not really aware

1272
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:04,320
of many of the events.

1273
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:05,850
In one of the episodes,

1274
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:08,750
the whole family's watching
the Apollo 8 take off,

1275
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:12,470
but I'm just sitting there
trying to call a girl.

1276
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:14,480
- The first episode of The Wonder Years,

1277
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:18,150
anybody who saw it,
remembers the ending where,

1278
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:22,320
you know, the first kiss
with Winnie and Kevin Arnold.

1279
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:25,670
The song that they play is
"When A Man Loves A Woman."

1280
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:29,866
That moment seemed so pure and so real.

1281
00:52:29,866 --> 00:52:34,866
♪ When a man loves a woman ♪

1282
00:52:34,928 --> 00:52:37,720
♪ Can't keep his mind on nothin' else ♪

1283
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,530
- The tone of the baby
boomers of the 1960s

1284
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:41,650
is about rebellion, about being students.

1285
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:45,010
By the 1980s, it's time
to grow up, and so,

1286
00:52:45,010 --> 00:52:47,430
they shave their beards,
give up their dashikis,

1287
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:50,236
and they put on power
suits, a whole new notion.

1288
00:52:50,236 --> 00:52:51,500
- Aw, the yuppies.

1289
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,230
Last year, the politicians
were all talking

1290
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:54,330
about winning their votes.

1291
00:52:54,330 --> 00:52:56,670
Now those young, urban
professionals and the rest

1292
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:59,060
of their baby boom
generation are being wooed

1293
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:01,420
by advertisers and their agencies.

1294
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:05,000
- By the 80s, it was pretty
clear that the generation

1295
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,760
after the generation of
the 60s may be embodied

1296
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,020
by Alex Keaton on Family Ties,

1297
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,310
seemed to be a lot more interested

1298
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:14,450
in the corner office
than the new Jerusalem.

1299
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:15,650
- You're a young man.

1300
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:17,670
You shouldn't be worried about success.

1301
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:20,578
You should be thinking about
hopping on a tramp steamer

1302
00:53:20,578 --> 00:53:22,190
and going around the world.

1303
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:23,936
- The 60s are over, Dad.

1304
00:53:23,936 --> 00:53:24,930
(audience laughing)

1305
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:26,320
- Thanks for the tip.

1306
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:30,210
- You weren't laughing at
Michael J. Fox's character

1307
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:31,720
for being too conservative.

1308
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:34,850
You were actually laughing at the parents

1309
00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:37,327
for being too hopelessly liberal.

1310
00:53:37,327 --> 00:53:38,435
- What is this?

1311
00:53:38,435 --> 00:53:39,980
I found it in the shower.

1312
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:42,040
- That's generic brand shampoo.

1313
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:43,014
- Ah!

1314
00:53:43,014 --> 00:53:43,847
(audience laughing)

1315
00:53:43,847 --> 00:53:47,064
- This is him, this is the guy
I've been telling ya about.

1316
00:53:47,064 --> 00:53:49,510
This is everything you'd
want in a president.

1317
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:52,130
- The genius of Family Ties is it allows

1318
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:53,970
a kind of youthful Regeanite to emerge

1319
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:55,190
that's focused more on the future,

1320
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:57,980
that's focused more on
a critique of the 60s.

1321
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:02,980
- Michael J. Fox as Alex
Keaton really became

1322
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,940
the center of the show and
the writers were smart enough

1323
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:09,989
to see that they had something special

1324
00:54:09,989 --> 00:54:12,206
and they wrote to that.

1325
00:54:12,206 --> 00:54:14,039
- It's not fair, Alex.

1326
00:54:14,039 --> 00:54:17,530
- Yeah, there's nothin'
you can do about it, Jen.

1327
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:20,380
My advice to you is that you just enjoy

1328
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:23,011
being a child for as long as you can.

1329
00:54:23,011 --> 00:54:24,688
I know I did.

1330
00:54:24,688 --> 00:54:27,243
It was the best two weeks of my life.

1331
00:54:27,243 --> 00:54:28,760
(audience laughing)

1332
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:31,057
- Alex is a little Bill Buckley.

1333
00:54:31,057 --> 00:54:33,430
The Wall Street Journal is his Bible.

1334
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:34,360
(laughing)

1335
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:36,680
He has a tie to go with his pajamas.

1336
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:40,349
He's very conservative and
very intense 17-year old.

1337
00:54:40,349 --> 00:54:41,182
(audience laughing)

1338
00:54:41,182 --> 00:54:42,410
The first thing your
teacher's gonna ask is what

1339
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:43,410
you did over the summer.

1340
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:45,500
Now, a lot of kids are gonna
say, I went to the zoo,

1341
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,960
or I went to the beach, or
I went to a baseball game.

1342
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,060
What are you gonna say?

1343
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:51,348
- I watched the Iran Contra hearings.

1344
00:54:51,348 --> 00:54:53,176
(audience laughing)

1345
00:54:53,176 --> 00:54:55,690
- [Barry] If mom and dad
thought his generation

1346
00:54:55,690 --> 00:54:58,340
was going to the dogs, think again.

1347
00:54:58,340 --> 00:54:59,590
This is the generation that

1348
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:01,810
has discovered hard work and success.

1349
00:55:01,810 --> 00:55:03,890
- American culture is changing in the 80s

1350
00:55:03,890 --> 00:55:05,700
and in terms of television,
there's a whole notion

1351
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,510
of Demographic segmentation.

1352
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:11,150
- Networks were beginning to not be afraid

1353
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:15,490
to appeal to a very specific demographic.

1354
00:55:15,490 --> 00:55:16,440
- Hey handsome.

1355
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:17,560
Look at that shirt.

1356
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:19,230
Is that a power shirt, or what?

1357
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:21,240
- Nice suit, Ellyn, good shoulder pads.

1358
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:23,165
You look like you're
drafted by the Eagles.

1359
00:55:23,165 --> 00:55:24,180
- Ooh, hoo.

1360
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:26,370
- Thirtysomethign said,
we're not gonna have cops,

1361
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:27,320
lawyers or doctors.

1362
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,553
We're just gonna be about people.

1363
00:55:28,553 --> 00:55:29,650
- What are we doing here?

1364
00:55:29,650 --> 00:55:31,515
Why did we start this business?

1365
00:55:31,515 --> 00:55:35,350
- To do our thing, but
right now, we got two wives,

1366
00:55:35,350 --> 00:55:40,050
three kids, four cars,
two mortgages, a payroll,

1367
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:41,560
and that's life, pal.

1368
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,983
You be the breadwinner now.

1369
00:55:44,838 --> 00:55:46,510
- Is that what I am?

1370
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:48,790
- Thirtysomething is a very important show

1371
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:51,830
as you're going into
this era of television

1372
00:55:51,830 --> 00:55:53,840
being more introspective
and more emotional

1373
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,090
and some people weren't buying it.

1374
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:56,780
But for other people,
when they were talking

1375
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:59,300
about things like having
kids and who was gonna

1376
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:01,520
go back to work and some of these issues

1377
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,370
that hadn't been talked about a whole lot,

1378
00:56:03,370 --> 00:56:04,902
it was important to people.

1379
00:56:04,902 --> 00:56:07,981
(baby crying)

1380
00:56:07,981 --> 00:56:09,343
- I was so looking forward,

1381
00:56:09,343 --> 00:56:12,701
I was so looking forward to doing this,

1382
00:56:12,701 --> 00:56:14,947
to being a grown-up for just an hour.

1383
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:18,480
- In the beginning, there
was talk of this being

1384
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,820
the yuppie show and you
mentioned it tonight.

1385
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:22,370
You said that if there were a category

1386
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:24,870
for the most annoying show,
this might win as well.

1387
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:26,363
- No, what some people
perceive as annoying,

1388
00:56:26,363 --> 00:56:27,790
it has nothing to do with yuppie.

1389
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:30,380
I think yuppie is a word
made up by demographers

1390
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:31,710
and advertisers to sell soap.

1391
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:34,150
I don't think it has anything
to do with what the show is.

1392
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:37,250
- Thirtysomething was not a giant hit,

1393
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:40,060
but it was a niche hit.

1394
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:44,460
It attracted an enormously
upscale group of advertisers.

1395
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:46,190
- The network cared who was watching,

1396
00:56:46,190 --> 00:56:47,900
not how many were watching,

1397
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:50,206
and that was more and more
catching on in the 80s.

1398
00:56:50,206 --> 00:56:53,180
(dramatic music)

1399
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:54,860
- The prosecution will
ask you that you look

1400
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:56,903
to the law and this you must do,

1401
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:02,360
but I ask of you that you
look to your hearts as well.

1402
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:03,840
Thank you.

1403
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:07,060
- LA Law was partly a classic lawyer show.

1404
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:09,840
But it was intertwined
with their personal lives

1405
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,800
and different lawyers who
were sleeping together

1406
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,950
and trying to get ahead.

1407
00:57:13,950 --> 00:57:16,530
- The reality level on
that show was like a foot

1408
00:57:16,530 --> 00:57:18,050
or two off the ground.

1409
00:57:18,050 --> 00:57:19,950
And you were willing to go with that

1410
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:23,050
because it was a whole
new spin on a law show.

1411
00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:24,530
- Uh-uh, tell the truth.

1412
00:57:24,530 --> 00:57:26,460
If you had to do it all over again,

1413
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:28,107
and she walked into your
office and she said,

1414
00:57:28,107 --> 00:57:30,514
"Take my case," would you?

1415
00:57:30,514 --> 00:57:32,060
- Well--
- Of course you would

1416
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:35,900
because it is juicy,
newsy, exciting stuff.

1417
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:39,520
- It was really fun to
take the Hill Street Blues

1418
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:44,520
format and use it to frame
an entirely different social

1419
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:50,860
and cultural strata with
vastly different results.

1420
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:54,330
- I wonder if I might engage
with my client privately?

1421
00:57:54,330 --> 00:57:55,163
- Certainly.

1422
00:57:57,170 --> 00:57:59,170
- What are you doing for dinner tonight?

1423
00:58:00,850 --> 00:58:03,100
- I was planning on having you.

1424
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:05,210
- Okay, skip lunch.

1425
00:58:05,210 --> 00:58:07,850
- The formula had gotten established

1426
00:58:07,850 --> 00:58:10,880
of how you can do a dramatic show and yet,

1427
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,730
still have an awful lot of fun.

1428
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:15,810
We didn't used to be able
to accept that very easily

1429
00:58:15,810 --> 00:58:19,060
in a TV hour and even
before the 80s are out,

1430
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:20,970
it's like, oh, okay, I get it.

1431
00:58:20,970 --> 00:58:23,310
So it's like, all right,
what are the rules now?

1432
00:58:23,310 --> 00:58:25,640
- You say you're part of
a change that's going on.

1433
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:28,310
Where is it coming from
and where's it going?

1434
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:32,100
- I think it has to do with
networks being more willing

1435
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:37,000
to put creative control
in the hands of producers,

1436
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,250
who have strong view points

1437
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:42,350
and letting them do what they wanna do.

1438
00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:44,870
- I think what Hill Street
Blues was and what Moonlighting

1439
00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:46,760
was is what the best television is,

1440
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,490
is it distinguishes itself by its voice.

1441
00:58:49,490 --> 00:58:51,140
- What we're supposed to be here is

1442
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:53,350
the one thing people can trust.

1443
00:58:53,350 --> 00:58:55,610
If you go out there like
a bunch of night riders,

1444
00:58:55,610 --> 00:58:58,890
what the hell are you but just
another vicious street gang?

1445
00:58:58,890 --> 00:59:00,610
- There was great writing in the 80s.

1446
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:03,740
That was a core group of brilliant people.

1447
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:06,160
- The audience's demands were changing.

1448
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,920
- It's obvious television
has changed a lot

1449
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,150
since the first Emmy was
awarded 35 years ago.

1450
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:13,670
- It's as though the contemporary audience

1451
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:17,624
was yearning for more
stories about themselves.

1452
00:59:17,624 --> 00:59:19,800
- Bye everybody out there on TV, bye.

1453
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:24,800
- As the 80s came to an
end, everything changed.

1454
00:59:24,863 --> 00:59:28,120
- I think one of the, when
we look back at the 1980s,

1455
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:30,800
10 and 20 years from now,
we're gonna be disgusted

1456
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,870
at some of the TV that
you've just mentioned,

1457
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:34,618
the super violent programs,
the terrible comedy shows,

1458
00:59:34,618 --> 00:59:36,860
but one of the great
things that's happening now

1459
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:39,010
and will continue to happen increasingly,

1460
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:40,370
throughout this decade,

1461
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:43,840
is the replacement of rotten
entertainment programming

1462
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:46,320
by news and talk and
information programming

1463
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:47,971
on all three networks, very slowly.

1464
00:59:47,971 --> 00:59:49,301
- But will it be rotten news and uh--

1465
00:59:49,301 --> 00:59:50,680
- Well, I don't think, so far,

1466
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:52,550
most of the news oriented programs,

1467
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:54,320
magazines, information, talk shows,

1468
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,340
and the networks, have been surprisingly,

1469
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:58,337
at least to me, surprisingly good.

1470
00:59:58,337 --> 00:59:59,233
(dramatic music)
