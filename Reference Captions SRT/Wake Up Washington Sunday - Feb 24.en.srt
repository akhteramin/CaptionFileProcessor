The record-breaking film, Black Panther,

to be nominated for best picture.

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,330
It features a predominately
Black cast, and gives Black boys

themselves as superheroes.

I just wanna see Black mermaids

I wanna see Black stories

Nigerian-American writer, Tomi Adeyemi,

of the resurgence of Afrofuturism.

22
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,020
- It's just kind of like a
utopia to imagine what if.

23
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,110
Like, what if this story wasn't a story

24
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,330
of having everything taken away

25
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:04,370
and having so much, like,
oppression, and brutality

26

and senseless murder, and slavery,

27

something completely different?

00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,790
When did it occur to
you that women of color

33
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,850
men of color, children of color
could be fantasy characters?

34
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:28,040
- I didn't realize until my
senior year of high school

35
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,990
that no characters look like me,

36
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,840
so all of my protagonists were
White or they were biracial.

37
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,240
Then I realized it's not
just me who needs this,

38
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,300
it's like, it's other
people who look like me,

39
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,870
but it's also people
who don't look like me

40
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,510
because the reason I didn't think

41
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,600
I could be in a story was
'cause I didn't see it.

44
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,080
- [Tomi] I wanted to write a story

45
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,330
that commented on the Black experience.

46
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:53,160
- In some ways, Afrofuturism is inherently

47
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,670
kind of a revolutionary act.

48
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:55,503
- Yeah.

49
00:01:55,503 --> 00:01:57,350
- Do you think of yourself
as a revolutionary?

50
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,960
- At this point I can think of myself

to tell our stories through our own lens

65

that we're telling our stories,

67
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,940

- [Alex] Panther popularized
the idea of Afrofuturism,

75
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,610
but its roots run deep.

76

that we celebrate,

the Frederick Douglass's,
the Sojourner Truth's,

of the Black people's story

85
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:24,900
and presence and imaging,
can be told and elevated.

86
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,840
- On one hand we have a
movie like Black Panther,

87
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,150
which is a lot of people's
entry point for Afrofuturism,

88
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,552
but you also have Black
Lives Matter movement,

89
00:03:32,552 --> 00:03:33,385
right?
- Right.

90

between those two things?

91
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,260
- Oh, definitely, I mean, I don't think

92
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,010
that Black Panther would have happened

93
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,900
without the precedent
of Black Lives Matter

94
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,140
'cause I think that
anytime there's outrage

95
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,260
and protest in the streets,
the cultural elites in America

96
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,170
tend to open up resources
and opportunity and space

97

for, you know, for Black creatives.

98
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,790
- [Alex] And the response suggests

99
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:58,810
audiences will start to see
even more Afrofuturist art.

100

Yes!

102

106
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,110
- And a sequel is underway.

107
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,220
Tomi Adeyemi's book is being made into

108

109
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,980
Do you think arts and
entertainment are changing?

110
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,770
- I definitely think they're changing.

111
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:24,220
We're finally getting
people who want to share it

112
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,580
with people, and people
who don't think that,

113
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,050
oh, people aren't gonna relate
to this because it's Black,

114
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,090
or they're not gonna relate to this

115
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,870
because it's African, it's too different.

116
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,660
They're like, no this is a great story

117
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,950
with great characters,
so let's make it visible,

118
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:39,260
and when people find it,
they'll fall in love with it.

119
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,890

happy to see the direction

120
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,480
that arts and entertainment
is headed into now.

121
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,920
It just seems more inclusive,
and yes, films like that,

122
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,120
you have little boys and
little girls, you know,

123

who say, hey, you know,
I see myself there.

124
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,580
- And I can be anything I
want, I can be a superhero.

125
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,040
I can conquer whatever I want.

126
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,550
I'm excited to see how Black
Panther does at the Oscars.

I know it's gonna sweep up
a lot of the awards there.

129
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,330

it's gonna be nice.

got the showers moving out.

134
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,200
It's turning warmer
today, but it is windy.

135
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,240
So those gusty winds could
bring down trees and power lines

136
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,440
between today, tonight
and tomorrow morning.

137
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,590
That's when we'll see
winds gusting in the metro

138
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,500
as high as 50 miles per hour,

139
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,350
higher than that out in the mountains.

140
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,780
We'll see a pretty quiet week overall,

141
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,070
more showers at the end of the week,

142
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,080
but today it's all about
the wind and the warmth.

143
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,470
