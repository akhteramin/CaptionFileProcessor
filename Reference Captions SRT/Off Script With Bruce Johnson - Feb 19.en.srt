and freezing rain.

no and a part of me says yes.

- Hello, I'm Bruce Johnson,
thanks for joining us.

18
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,053
Welcome to OffScript.

19
00:00:48,053 --> 00:00:48,930
Got lots to talk about.

20
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,820
I sat down with noted
scholar and Jesuit priest,

21
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,810
Father Thomas Reese earlier today

22
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:56,560
for an important conversation
about sexual abuse

23
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,610
in the Catholic Church.

24
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:58,870
That interview coming up

25
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:02,600
but first we need to bring
you up to date on the weather.

26
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,940
A red weather alert, here's Topper Shutt.

27
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:05,773
- Yeah and I want to emphasize,

28
00:01:05,773 --> 00:01:08,370
we have trimmed the snowfall
totals a little bit.

29
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,030
That doesn't diminish
the impact of the storm.

30
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,800
It's sort of like focusing of
the hurricane, just on winds,

31
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,227
it has other elements that are dangerous

32
00:01:15,227 --> 00:01:18,140
and this certainly does to
with sleet and freezing rain.

33
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,070
Three to five inches, plus.

34
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,920
Gattersburg, Frederick,
Leesburg, Martinsburg,

35
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,370
up towards Hagerstown, into the mountains.

36
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,840
One to three in the immediate
metro area, including D.C.

37
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,410
Chevy Chase, Buoy, Bethesda,

38
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,940
down to the south, southern
Maryland, not as much.

39
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,690
You were never gonna
have that much anyway.

40
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:33,880
A trace to an inch,

41
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,610
your cold air is just
simply lacking a little bit.

42
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:37,870
So what does that mean?

43
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,940
Well, it still means that
the roads are gonna be

44
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,540
a disaster as we get
into Wednesday morning.

45
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,050
RPM up to it's old tricks
again, going seven inches.

46
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:48,730
Everybody else has a grasp on reality

47
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:50,170
around two inches to three inches.

48
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:53,210
Which is where we settled
on in the metro area.

49
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,043
So what do we know?

50
00:01:54,043 --> 00:01:56,440
Well we know that snowfall
will be moderate to heavy

51
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,810
six a.m. to noon,

52
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,960
and the roads will
become very treacherous.

53
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,970
And when it starts it's gonna
pick up in intensity quickly

54
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,000
and it's going to accumulate very quickly.

55
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,250
The snow will go to a mix north
and west in the afternoon.

56
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,480
And it will go to rain
D.C., south and east

57
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,690
in the afternoon.

58
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,090
And if we can get through the day

59
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,290
it'll turn to all rain tomorrow night.

60
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:16,910
After some morning showers on Thursday

61
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,840
we pop back in the 50's.

62
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,280
Look how much moisture is headed our way.

63
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,900
If this system were about
300 miles off to the east

64
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,440
we'd be looking at
another, a little blizzard.

65
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,550
But we're not so, five
o'clock in the morning.

66
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:31,130
Little bit of snow breaking
out in part of the metro area.

67
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,560
Temps, upper 20's, low 30's

68
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,010
becomes pretty much heavy to moderate

69
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:36,300
across the entire metro area.

70
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,730
This is by seven o'clock on Wednesday.

71
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,690
The temps are still 29, 30 degrees.

72
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,330
By the time we get to
ten o'clock we still have

73
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,650
heavy snow across the metro area.

74
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,880
And then it begins to mix and change

75
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,110
right around the lunch hour.

76
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:47,943
We will come back.

77
00:02:47,943 --> 00:02:50,330
We will talk about how
much ice could accumulate

78
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,930
behind the snow and who we think

79
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,673
are most likely for power outages.

80
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,960
- Okay, let's talk some baseball here.

81
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,350
Manny Machado is getting 300 million.

82
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,690
What will Bryce Harper get?

83
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,207
Reports tonight say Machado has agreed

84
00:03:03,207 --> 00:03:05,140
to sign with San Diego Padres.

85
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:09,350
Contract reportedly worth
$300 million over ten years.

86
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,140
The deal is reported to be pending

87
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,770
the results of a physical.

88
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,750
The former Baltimore Oriole's
and LA Dodgers infielder

89
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,390
is slated to play third
base for the Padre's.

90
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,270
Now, the attention turns to Bryce Harper.

91
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,910
Speculation about where he'll end up

92
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,890
is all over social media tonight.

93
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:26,100
Will he resign with the Nationals?

94
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,530
Most of us don't think so.

95
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,820
The latest rumors have
him going to Philadelphia.

96
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,930
The Nats player's already
in spring training camp

97
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:32,880
down in Florida.

98
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,160
Darrin Haynes sat down with
Nats manager Dave Martinez

99
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,040
to talk about Bryce.

100
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,850
- How much do you want Bryce on your team?

101
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,590
- You know what, Bryce and I
have a special relationship.

102
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,680
I mean, everybody knows that.

103
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,810
Who wouldn't want Bryce
Harper on their team?

104
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,290
Honestly, I mean, he's one
of the best young players

105
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,940
in the game, you know.

106
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:57,940
And you know for me it's
all about what he wants now.

107
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:02,650
You know, for his family and
his career, it really is.

108
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,070
So, I mean, he's got
big decisions to make.

109
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:10,070
You know, but I'd be be wrong to say that,

110
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,650
of course you know, anybody
would want him on his team.

111
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,100
He makes a big difference.

112
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,793
- If Bryce decided hey, you know what,

113
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,820
I'm coming back to the Nationals.

114
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,960
What would be your reaction
when he walks in the door?

115
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,360
- Hey, I'd be like hey,
welcome back, you know.

116
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,570
- That's it, that's it huh.

117
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,740
- Time to work, you know.

118
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,000
Let's go to work, you know .

119
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,893
- Do you think Bryce Harper's coming back?

120
00:04:35,744 --> 00:04:40,150
- You know part of me says
no and a part of me says yes.

121
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,270
You know, you just, the way
this game is you just don't,

122
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,410
you really don't know.

123
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,400
- Which way are you leaning towards?

124
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,163
- I you know what, I honestly
I, like I said, I can't,

125
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:51,730
I can't lean either way.

126
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,113
It's so weird because of, you know.

127
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,890
You know like I said,
you know, and I try to,

128
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:00,330
you know I try like
say hey, you know what,

129
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:03,020
this is what I gotta do today you know.

130
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:07,020
I gotta lead 59 guys tomorrow morning.

131
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,130
Get up at six o'clock,
get to that ballpark

132
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,350
and get the day going you know.

133
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:17,200
My focus is on the day at
hand and the here and now and

134
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,993
that's kind of what I worry about.

135
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,862
- Eat your food man.

136
00:05:21,862 --> 00:05:24,550
(laughing)

137
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,383
- Thanks Darrin.

138
00:05:25,383 --> 00:05:26,380
Is Martinez playing us?

139
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,880
How does he not know?

140
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,130
Joining me to discuss all
this column is Mike Wise.

141
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,090
How does he not know
what Bryce is gonna do?

142
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,810
- I think, I don't know if he does

143
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:37,360
because I think there's
this big question mark here.

144
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,440
Manny Machado just signed for
the largest free agent deal

145
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,150
in the history of American
sports, not just baseball.

146
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,670
And there's a big pressure on Scott Boras,

147
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:50,510
who is Bryce's agent to go at
least one dollar over that.

148
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,700
The Nationals have already
offered 300 million.

149
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,950
I don't know if that offer
is even there any more

150
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,060
for ten years.

151
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,070
So this is, I think what
Dave Martinez is thinking is,

152
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:04,180
has Ted Lerner broke his
dependency with Scott Boras

153
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,370
whom he's got all this,

154
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,310
he had a bunch of his clients before.

155
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:10,070
Can he say no to Scott Boras this time.

156
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,890
And I think that's gonna be the question.

157
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:14,970
Personally, I kind of want Bryce to stay.

158
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,680
I really do, I think
he's Q-Rating in town.

159
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,200
He's star power.

160
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,170
- We like stars.

161
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,003
I mean he puts people in the seats--

162
00:06:21,003 --> 00:06:21,860
- We do like stars.

163
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,950
- He puts jerseys on the kids' backs.

164
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,990
That sort of thing.

165
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:25,847
But what do you think?

166
00:06:25,847 --> 00:06:26,680
Whatcha got?

167
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,900
- My gut is that the Phillies

168
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,740
are gonna offer something so enormous.

169
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,920
One person said nine years, 367 million.

170
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,900
I don't know if that's
gonna happen or not.

171
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,700
I do know that the Nationals

172
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,950
will be given a chance to counter.

173
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:45,350
I can't see them going over
350 million, I just can't.

174
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,890
You know, just based on their payroll,

175
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,940
just based on what they've
got committed already.

176
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,960
But I don't know, you know, I don't know.

177
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,870
That could be a wild card.

178
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,400
- What you haven't mentioned,

179
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,800
the Nats already have a team.

180
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,940
They have somebody in
Bryce's position right now.

181
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,860
Does that matter?

182
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,210
- They have Robles, they got Juan Soto,

183
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:03,570
those are guys that are gonna

184
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,290
definitely take his spot at the plate.

185
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,360
They're not gonna be Bryce Harper.

186
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,050
Bryce Harper was a live wire.

187
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,350
He was like a hand grenade.

188
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,183
He was a,

189
00:07:11,183 --> 00:07:12,590
you didn't know when he was gonna explode.

190
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,861
- And we don't need to see him.

191
00:07:13,861 --> 00:07:14,719
- And he was the most
exciting thing in sports

192
00:07:14,719 --> 00:07:15,552
in Washington for a while.

193
00:07:15,552 --> 00:07:16,650
- And we don't nee to see
him in a Phillies uniform.

194
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,730
They already bring
thousands of fans down here

195
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,723
every time they play the Nats.

196
00:07:19,723 --> 00:07:21,420
- Philly fans are the worst.

197
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,253
- Ha!

198
00:07:22,253 --> 00:07:23,260
- And I love you Selika.

199
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,990
I know you, I work with you,
Philly fans are the worst.

200
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,100
- All right, okay, she works here.

201
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,190
All right, Mike Wise, thanks
a lot man, appreciate it.

202
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,023
- All right.

203
00:07:30,023 --> 00:07:31,110
- Okay, flip the page.

204
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,610
Sexual abuse scandals have
shaken the Catholic Church

205
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:34,690
at its core.

206
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:37,560
For us it starts here in Washington D.C.

207
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,210
where former cardinal and
Archbishop Theodore McCarrick

208
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,640
has been defrocked by the Pope.

209
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,940
He is now only Mr. McCarrick

210
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,510
and living in a remote
monastery somewhere out there

211
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,640
in the Midwest.

212
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,040
To Argentina, where the New
York Times is reporting,

213
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,950
deaf children were
sexually abused for years

214
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,490
by the priests who should
have been caring for them.

215
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,710
You probably now that Pope
Francis this week will begin

216
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,330
a summit of bishops and cardinals

217
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,650
who have been called to Rome to fix this.

218
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,490
But can they, will they?

219
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,060
Today I talk with Father Thomas Reese.

220
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,540
He's a noted Jesuit priest and scholar

221
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,840
who is on his way to Rome.

222
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,870
Father Reese first off

223
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,730
tell me why you're
going to Rome right now.

224
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:17,190
- I'm going to Rome because
the Pope has called a meeting

225
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:20,210
of the top bishops from around the world

226
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:24,590
to come and talk to him
about the sex abuse crisis.

227
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:29,090
He wants to emphasis to
them how important it is

228
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:34,050
to protect children and their
responsibility to do that.

229
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:37,930
And I think he's gonna make
the point that if they don't,

230
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:39,300
if they're not responsible

231
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,010
he's going to hold them accountable.

232
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:43,440
So this is gonna be an important meeting

233
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,750
for the Catholic Church

234
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,660
because it's the first meeting like this

235
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,040
that's ever happened.

236
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,390
- Yeah, let's talk about
some of the headlines.

237
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:55,620
I mean, just today, the
Washington Post is reporting

238
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,290
that deaf children were sexually abused

239
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,310
by priests in Argentina.

240
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,340
What do you make of this?

241
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,340
Is this gonna come up in Rome?

242
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:07,250
- This is, I mean this is
just a terrible tragedy.

243
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:11,750
I mean, children are so
scarred by this crime.

244
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,000
This abuse that they suffer under.

245
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,860
And that's why the church
has to have a policy

246
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,150
to deal with it.

247
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,900
You know, in the United
States we've had a zero policy

248
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,110
on abuse of children.

249
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,300
And in fact in the church

250
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,550
we've had this policy of zero tolerance.

251
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:31,450
So that anybody, any
priest involved in abuse

252
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,050
is removed from the priesthood

253
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:35,680
and could never act as a priest again.

254
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,760
Now the second part is to make sure that

255
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,730
all the bishops implement this policy.

256
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:44,860
Make it happen and that's
gonna be an important message

257
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,220
at this meeting.

258
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,490
- Father Reese talk to me
about the apparent hypocrisy

259
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,623
in all of this.

260
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,530
It's come out today in
a New York Times article

261
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,700
that the Vatican has a book,

262
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,050
has rules on what to do with children

263
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:02,440
who are fathered by priests.

264
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,910
Who knew?

265
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,300
- Well I think that the,

266
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,480
actually when you look at the document

267
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,350
from the reports that I've seen,

268
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:13,310
the emphasis in the document is on

269
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:16,500
the priests responsibility for his child.

270
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,420
Pope Francis has said this in the past.

271
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,250
He said that even before he became Pope.

272
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,860
And that is that if a
priest fathers a child

273
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,990
then he has a responsibility as a father.

274
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:31,620
Not, you know, financial responsibility

275
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,260
and also just as a father.

276
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,750
As a paternal responsibility

277
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,730
and that that responsibility supersedes

278
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,950
his responsibility to be a priest.

279
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:46,950
And he needs to leave the
priesthood and raise that child.

280
00:10:47,471 --> 00:10:48,304
(uptempo music)

281
00:10:48,304 --> 00:10:49,137
- [Bruce] Coming up,

Texas toast garlic bread.

320
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:42,260
Four of the greatest words, ever.

321
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,720
Put that toast on two juicy patties

322
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,293
with all the fix-ins for a classic double.

323
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,860
Or cover it with crispy
onions dripping with

324
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,850
sweet smokey barbecue.

325
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:56,440
Then drop the garlicky buttery mic.

326
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,560
Because you just won at eating.

327
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,610
For only $2.99, new Texas
Toast Garlic Bread Doubles.

328
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:03,570
Checkers and Rally's.

329
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,350
Fast foodies know the deal.

330
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,770
- Don't go through another
cold winter this year

331
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:12,380
with those old, open top
gutters that clog, freeze, warp

332
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,030
and fall off your home.

333
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:16,530
Eliminate climbing the
ladders to clean the gutters,

334
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,850

354
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,010
- Welcome back to OffScript.

355
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:10,670
The Pope has summoned church
leaders from around the world

356
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:13,670
to meet at the Vatican as
the church is now in crisis.

357
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:16,360
Will they address the
issue of gay priests?

358
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,050
Let's continue the conversation
with noted Jesuit priest

359
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,980
and scholar Father Thomas Reese.

360
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,200
It's a Skype interview

361
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,470
and this part of the
connection wasn't as clear

362
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:27,220
but we think it's that important.

363
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:30,093
What about the whole issue of gay priests?

364
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,220
I was in the seminary a hundred years ago,

365
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,790
there were 13 guys in my class.

366
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:38,440
Only one went the entire 13
years and became a priest

367
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,720
and I know that John was gay, okay.

368
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,163
We've known all along that
there are gay priests.

369
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,070
If it were up to a lot of Catholics

370
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,780
there would be openly gay priests.

371
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,140
There would be women priests.

372
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:55,270
There would be married priests
who could then have children.

373
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,120
When is the Church gonna come to this

374
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,680
or is this just wishful thinking?

375
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,450
- The first important thing to say is

376
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:06,320
that there are a lot of
wonderful gay priests

377
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,390
in the priesthood.

378
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:12,390
Priests who, gay priests who
observe their vow of celibacy

379
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,380
and are very good pastoral priests.

380
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:22,620
We don't wanna mix up
the issue of gay priests

381
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:26,583
with the issue of sexual abuse of minors.

382
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:32,340
And I, you know, that needs to,
that point needs to be made.

383
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,680
But I agree with you.

384
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,793
I think we need more
honesty in the church.

385
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,810
For example, the US bishops
have never allowed anybody

386
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:43,070
to survey priests to find out, you know,

387
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,960
what percentage of them are gay.

388
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:49,960
We've got estimated from
10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60.

389
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,840
I mean, all over the place.

390
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,880
And nobody's got any real data.

391
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,680
The one fact we do know is that

392
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,870
there are gay priests
there and most of them,

393
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:05,280
you know, are good priests
who observe their promise

394
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:09,730
of celibacy and are good for the church.

395
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:12,470
- Do you expect anything
to come of this meeting

396
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:15,043
or is this just gonna
be more window dressing?

397
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,050
- [Thomas] I think that most Americans

398
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:21,010
are gonna be disappointed
with this meeting.

399
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:24,660
Because we would like to
see policies and procedures

400
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:28,513
set up and structures to
hold bishops accountable.

401
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,473
I think the truth of the matter is

402
00:16:31,473 --> 00:16:36,400
that this meeting is
primarily for other countries

403
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,050
where bishops are in total denial.

404
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,795
They don't think they have this problem.

405
00:16:40,795 --> 00:16:43,440
They think this is an American problem.

406
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,360
And basically the message we want to take

407
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,790
to these bishops is,

408
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:52,133
don't make the same mistakes
that the American bishops made.

409
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:55,057
You know, get your act together now.

410
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:58,710
Remove these bad crazies and reach out

411
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:02,130
and help the victims in healing.

412
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:05,410
- But Father Reese it's
not just the priests,

413
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:09,260
we're seeing Theodore McCarrick,
right here in Washington.

414
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:12,650
Who has become the poster
child for this kind of abuse.

415
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,370
So it's not just the priests,

416
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:17,260
the bishops are being
asked to police themselves.

417
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,680
Are they not?

418
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,740
- No, I think that you know,

419
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:25,013
this is very important and
needs to be dealt with.

420
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:29,380
McCarrick because he was a retired bishop,

421
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,687
you know, they brought the
information to the Vatican

422
00:17:31,687 --> 00:17:32,770
and the Vatican said,

423
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:35,970
okay treat him just
like you would a priest

424
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:38,100
of the archdiocese of New York.

425
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,130
So his case was investigated.

426
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:46,130
They hired a forensic research team.

427
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,523
The information was presented
to the lay review board

428
00:17:50,523 --> 00:17:53,060
and they said the
accusations were credible

429
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:56,640
and substantiated and he
was removed from, you know,

430
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,960
he was removed.

431
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,730
And he had to resign his being a cardinal

432
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:06,130
and now he's been removed
from the priesthood.

433
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:08,853
He's not, now he can no
longer be Father McCarrick

434
00:18:08,853 --> 00:18:11,696
or Bishop McCarrick, he is Mr McCarrick.

435
00:18:11,696 --> 00:18:12,529
- [Bruce] Yeah.

436
00:18:12,529 --> 00:18:14,389
- He can never act as a priest again.

437
00:18:14,389 --> 00:18:15,222
- [Bruce] Yeah.

438
00:18:15,222 --> 00:18:17,230
- This is exactly what should happen.

439
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,160
- Father Reese good luck on your trip.

440
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,239
Look forward to your reporting.

441
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:23,790
- Thank you, good to be with you.

442
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:26,230
- And Washington's
current Archbishop Donald

443
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,030
is obviously leaving.

444
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:32,330
We don't have any word tonight
on who will succeed him.

445
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:34,400
If you're just tuning in
and you missed part one

446
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,090
of our interview, both segments
will be posted on wusa9.com

447
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,860

448
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,380

449
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,940

454
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,233
Coming up next.

455
00:18:51,233 --> 00:18:55,200
(slow instrumental music)

456
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,033
- [Man] Tonight,

457
00:18:56,033 --> 00:18:56,866
- What do we got?

458
00:18:56,866 --> 00:18:58,920
- [Man] NCIS has a surprise so good,

459
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,330
missing it would be criminal.

460
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:01,820
- Your computer is trying to--

461
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,310
- Take down the Department of Defense.

462
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,890
- [Man] New NCIS, then.

463
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,040
- Looks like a professional hit.

464
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,913
- [Man] The search for answers
leads to more questions.

465
00:19:08,913 --> 00:19:11,090
- Who hired you?

466
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:15,390
- [Man] A new FBI after
a new NCIS, CBS tonight.

467
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,223
- [Man] Tonight.

468
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:18,060
- If you get this send help!

469
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,870
- [Man] One journalist under siege,

470
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,910
when conspiracy uncovered.

471
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,330
- We got another to go on.

472
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,580
- [Man] NCIS New Orleans tonight.

473
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,240
- [Announcer] Fourth of
July has its fireworks.

474
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,390

00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,940
But what about Presidents' Day?

476
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:37,033
Let's just say the voters
will be very happy.

477

and search the WUSA9
app in your app store.

514
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,840
Alright, we're looking at a
red weather alert for the snow,

515
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,520
for the sleet and also
for the freezing rain.

516
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,570
All right here is a look
at our snowfall maps.

517
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:44,770
Three to five Leesburg,
Gaithersburg, Frederick,

518
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,140
points north and west.

519
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,950
In the metro, one to three.

520
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:49,340
These are a little lower than yesterday.

521
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:52,580
Yes, because we're thinking
more sleet and less snow

522
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,040
and then to Southern Maryland,

523
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,732
y'all never had that much coming anyway,

524
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:57,690
trace to an inch there.

525
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,560
Notice there's a plus sign out here.

526
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,210
Some of you folks in that band could get

527
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:04,800
conceivably over five inches of snow,

528
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,000
which is gonna be a problem
as it kicks to rain.

529
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,160
So we're kinda worried about that.

530
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,208
We'll get back to this in a second.

531
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:12,400
Look, but we look forward to 66 on Sunday.

532
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,040
We gotta get through
some things to get there.

533
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,210
So here we some.

534
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,940
All right, GFS, European model.

535
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,340
Pretty much in agreement with us

536
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,260
around three inches downtown.

537
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,090
That seems reasonable,
look at the moisture.

538
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,440
This is crazy.

539
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:28,020
I mean for Wichita, Kansas,
all the way to Cape Hatteras,

540
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:31,350
it was snow extending up into Iowa

541
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,040
and also South Dakota and Nebraska.

542
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,660
That's a big storm.

543
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,820
So on the broad-o-meter I
do kind of reserve these for

544
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:41,040
pure snows but because this
is gonna be a legitimate snow

545
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,730
with some sleet and freezing rain

546
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,410
and enough snow on the front end too.

547
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:46,920
That'd be plowable and sledable.

548
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,790
In terms of the impact,

549
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:50,140
well, we know it's coming so hopefully

550
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:53,040
folks will just stay off the
road but nonetheless still

551
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:57,250
we're gonna give it a 3.5 in
the impact-o-meter as well.

552
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,530
So it's certainly a legitimate storm.

553
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:01,450
Now I have updated this,
this is on our website.

554
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:02,910
I just tweeted this out.

555
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:06,110
In terms of power outages
and here's why I did this.

556
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:10,510
Isolated along I-95 and
points west, unlikely east

557
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:13,520
and then scattered out in
Cumberland, Romney and Hagerstown

558
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,730
where we think significant
icing will occur.

559
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:17,960
But here's the deal, either
where icing won't occur

560
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,150
if we get three inches of snow in DC,

561
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:23,430
plain old fashioned rain will
add to the weight of that snow

562
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,810
and could bring down limbs as well.

563
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:26,410
So we may see power outages,

564
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:29,210
not just confined to those
areas that pick up ice.

565
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:33,140
Alright, this is one model,
most of the ice far to the west

566
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,550
and not that bad, Petersburg three tenths

567
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,760
and about two tenths in Romney.

568
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,330
We can probably handle that.

569
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:39,380
This is gonna be tough.

570
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,830
This is now almost an inch
of ice outdoor Cumberland,

571
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:44,140
three tenths Leesburg,
three tenths Gaithersburg

572
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:47,430
that would cause some
power outages no doubt.

573
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,940
Why is it not a pure snow?

574
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,430
Well we start out with the pure snow

575
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:53,320
'cause this column of air
is all below freezing.

576
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,700
But then we get warm air

577
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,790
as it moves into the middle
layers of the atmosphere

578
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:59,640
either becomes sleet which
is the bouncy pieces of ice

579
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,660
but freezing rain is what
we're most concerned about,

580
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:05,030
falls liquid and then
just freezes on contact.

581
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:07,010
So this hasn't changed
too much from yesterday.

582
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,450
We adjusted the time a bit.

583
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:09,890
Heavier snows 6 a.m. to noon.

584
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:11,460
Roads will become dangerous.

585
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,760
It will start quickly,
become intense quickly

586
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,370
and accumulate quickly.

587
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,860
It will go to a mixed north
and west in the afternoon.

588
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,970
It will go to rain DC, south
and east in the afternoon.

589
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:22,420
And heavy rain possible overnight

590
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:26,180
and then showers then we're
in the 50's on Thursday.

591
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,013
How about that?

592
00:24:27,013 --> 00:24:28,700
So 6 a.m. tomorrow,

593
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,540
there's a snow across
most of the metro area.

594
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,450
Notice the shades of blue,

595
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:33,290
the darker the blue, heavier snow.

596
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:34,880
Pretty much thumping at nine o'clock,

597
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,700
no doubt but that begins to turn

598
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,660
as we get toward the lunch hour,

599
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,010
especially down to the south

600
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:42,900
and then just plain old
rain DC, south and east

601
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,060
by about three o'clock.

602
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:47,970
Some lingering freezing
rain north and west

603
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:51,060
until the evening, so here we go.

604
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:54,790
Red alert on Wednesday, 56,
morning showers Thursday

605
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:57,470
and then nice on Friday, 54.

606
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,720
In terms of the snow once again,

607
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,960
we're looking again three
to five north and west

608
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,530
and one to three in the metro
and about trace to an inch

609
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:06,610
south and east.

610
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:08,062
Bruce will be back after this.

611
00:25:08,062 --> 00:25:10,312

- Hi Ron Sherman back again for LeafGuard.

661
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:05,160
They tell us that thousands
of accidents happen each day

662
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,020
nationwide up on ladders.

663
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,630
It's really dangerous in the wintertime

664
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,360
and they say us folks over 60

665
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,720

share of ladder accidents.

669
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,920
- The ladder, the extension
ladder slipped out from under me

670
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:28,440
and I wound up upside
down hanging from my leg

671
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,900
on the extension ladder
and that wasn't too good.
