- [Cecilia] Tonight, breaking news.

16
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,580
The verdict just in.

17
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,900
The decorated Navy SEAL
accused of murdering

18
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,640
a wounded prisoner in Iraq.

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,250
The stunning moment when
another SEAL team member

20
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,450
took responsibility for the killing.

21
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,070
What the jury has just decided.

22
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:53,470
Also breaking, the explosion

23
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,420
rocking an American neighborhood.

24
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,270
The blast destroying a home,
firefighters frantically

25
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,350
digging through rubble
looking for possible victims.

26
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,530
The man calling 911 saying
he's trapped under the debris.

27
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,950
The nail biter World Cup victory,

28
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:08,984
Team USA beating England,

29
00:01:08,984 --> 00:01:12,310
their star player on the sidelines hurt.

30
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,473
So will she be there for the finals?

31
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,780
A scathing new government
report about life

32
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,060
inside those migrant detention centers.

33
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:23,660
Men kept for a week in
standing room only cells.

34
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,720
One manager calling the
scene "a ticking time bomb".

35
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,530
What Homeland Security is now saying.

36
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,310
Growing backlash over President Trump's

37
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,810
4th of July plans, tanks and fighter jets

38
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,540
headed to the National Mall.

39
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,730
The president accused
of turning the holiday

40
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,030
into a political rally.

41
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,420
The mystery over the sudden
death of Angels' pitcher

42
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,140
Tyler Skaggs, found dead in his hotel room

43
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,160
in the prime of his career.

44
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,410
What authorities and
the team revealed today.

45
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,810
And the shark scare off the coast,

46
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,850
a mother and her children in the water

47
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:59,020
with no idea what's lurking
just a few feet away.

48
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,863
- [Narrator] This is ABC World
News Tonight with David Muir.

49
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,760
- Good evening, and it's
great to have you with us

50
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,130
on this busy Tuesday night.

51
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,760
I'm Cecilia Vega in for David

52
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,890
and we begin with that bombshell verdict

53
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,930
in the war crimes trial
of a former Navy SEAL.

54
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,730
A military jury finding
Special Operations Chief

55
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,430
Edward Gallagher not guilty

56
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,860
of murdering a captured ISIS fighter.

57
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,300
Gallagher was convicted of a single crime,

58
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,290
taking a photo with the
body of a dead captive.

59
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,810
Gallagher was deployed
to Iraq in 2017 when

60
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:29,920
the incident took place,

61
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,350
his own platoon turning him in.

62
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:35,150
But then that stunning
turn during the trial.

63
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,670
A prosecution witness testifying that he,

64
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,650
not Gallagher, actually
killed the captive.

65
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,530
ABC's Clayton Sandell starts us off.

66
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,950
- [Clayton] Edward Gallagher's
attorneys celebrating tonight

67
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,670
on the steps of the courthouse after a

68
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,220
military jury found the
decorated Navy SEAL not guilty

69
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,770
of premeditated murder.

70
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:57,590
- Huge victory, huge
weight off the Gallaghers.

71
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,770
Huge victory for justice.

72
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,330
- [Clayton] The 19 year combat veteran

73
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:05,050
was accused of war crimes
during a 2017 tour in Iraq

74
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,070
including murdering this
teenage ISIS prisoner

75
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:10,640
seen wounded in this Iraqi TV video.

76
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,360
Fellow SEAL Corey Scott, granted immunity,

77
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,750
testified that he saw Gallagher, a medic,

78
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,800
stab that teen in the neck.

79
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,900
But in a shocking twist,
Scott testified that he,

80
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,030
not Gallagher, killed the
teen by plugging his airway

81
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,970
to prevent him from being
tortured by Iraqi forces,

82
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,930
saying "I knew he was
going to die anyway".

83
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,360
Gallagher's defense team
argued during the two week

84
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,480
trial that the case was
built on false accusations

85
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,070
from disgruntled sailors.

86
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,540
- This is not a murder, this is a mutiny.

87
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,520
This is a group of young,
disgruntled sailors

88
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,706
that didn't like being told
that they were cowards.

89
00:03:43,706 --> 00:03:47,600
And so they decided to conspire
to take down the chief.

90
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,710
- And Clayton Sandell joins us now live.

91
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,700
Clayton, we know that Edward
Gallagher was convicted

92
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,870
of that one charge, posing for a picture

93
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,630
with the captive's dead body.

94
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,733
So, could he still face prison time?

95
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,293
- That's right, Cecilia.

96
00:04:00,293 --> 00:04:03,050
Prosecutors showed those
pictures during the trial.

97
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,632
Defense attorneys argue that
the sentence for that crime

98
00:04:05,632 --> 00:04:07,990
would be less than the
time he's already served.

99
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,620
So they believe Gallagher
will be going home tonight.

100
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,453
Cecilia?

101
00:04:11,453 --> 00:04:13,110
- Clayton Sandell leading us
off this evening, thank you.

102
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,700
To our other top story tonight,

103
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,560
that massive explosion
rocking an entire neighborhood

104
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,970
in North Carolina.

105
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,770
This stunning image from above.

106
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:23,010
A hole where a home used to be.

107
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,030
First responders combing
through the rubble,

108
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,860
one man trapped underneath
using his cell phone

109
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,970
to call for help.

110
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,020
He was rescued along with
at least two other people,

111
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,920
but the urgent search for
other victims goes on.

112
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,430
Here's ABC's Steve Osunsami.

113
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:41,693
- [Witness] It is just jaw
dropping to see this scene.

114
00:04:42,675 --> 00:04:43,690
- [Steve] Families
across this neighborhood

115
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,033
in an expensive suburb
of Charlotte say it felt

116
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:47,269
like an earthquake.

117
00:04:47,269 --> 00:04:49,810
- [First Responder] The house
exploded and is now on fire,

118
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,420
also reporting insulation in the trees.

119
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,292
Unknown if anyone's inside.

120
00:04:54,292 --> 00:04:55,740
- [Steve] From the sky you could see

121
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,630
the desperate search for survivors.

122
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,760
Firefighters trying to saw
through large piles of wood.

123
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,220
- [Witness] A natural gas sort of issue

124
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,110
or if it's something else,
but it is still burning.

125
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,880
- This is what's left of
this large home in Valentine.

126
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,770
For reasons that aren't clear
at this hour, it exploded.

127
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:11,790
- [First Responder] We do have contact

128
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,820
with one trapped on the phone right now.

129
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,420
We're trying to find the location of where

130
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,290
they're at in the rubble.

131
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,540
- [Steve] A man who was inside the home

132
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,110
was buried under all of this.

133
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,280
He had a phone nearby,
was able to call 911,

134
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,900
and lead firefighters directly to him.

135
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,940
Here he's being airlifted to the hospital.

136
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,910
- They were on the phone
talking to alarm at the time

137
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,280
and did provide their location

138
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,800
which assisted greatly in
locating and removing the patient.

139
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,530
- Authorities continue
to search for at least

140
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,440
one other possible victim tonight.

141
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,360
The blast also tore into
this home next door.

142
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,963
Two neighbors were treated
by medics at the scene.

143
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,500
This is difficult weather for
the firefighters to work in

144
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,227
with temperatures in the
90s, pushing 100 degrees,

145
00:05:50,227 --> 00:05:53,780
more than 80 firefighters
were called into help.

146
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,613
Cecilia?

147
00:05:54,613 --> 00:05:56,390
- Urgent search there,
okay Steve, thank you.

148
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:59,220
And from France tonight,
that nail biter victory

149
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,660
for team USA.

150
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,970
The women celebrating a
close game against England

151
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,700
in the World Cup semifinal.

152
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,530
They now head to the finals.

153
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,210
But today's win happened
without their star player,

154
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,470
so will she be there for the clincher?

155
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,537
ABC's Adrienne Bankert
is outside the stadium.

156
00:06:13,537 --> 00:06:16,193
- [Sports Announcer] That was it, US wins.

157
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,560
- [Adrienne] Tonight,
victory, team USA now charging

158
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,610
straight for that World Cup
final after a two to one win

159
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,469
over England.

160
00:06:23,469 --> 00:06:24,970
(cheering)

161
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,610
Tens of thousands of Americans
cheering in the stands

162
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:28,820
here in Lyon.

163
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,290
The epic matchup getting
off to a stunning start

164
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,990
with star Megan Rapinoe on the sidelines,

165
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,410
no warmup with the team.

166
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,130
It sparks worry about a possible injury.

167
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,190
At game time Christen
Press takes her place,

168
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,197
not missing a beat.

169
00:06:42,197 --> 00:06:44,245
- [Sports Announcer] Right side cross.

170
00:06:44,245 --> 00:06:45,988
Done, go!

171
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,790
(Cheering)

172
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,620
- [Adrienne] Even a goal
from England powerhouse

173
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,013
Ellen White couldn't stop
USA momentum for long.

174
00:06:53,852 --> 00:06:56,851
- [Sports Announcer] Me,
drives it from white, goal!

175
00:06:56,851 --> 00:06:59,140
England have tied it.

176
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,230
- [Adrienne] Then there was
Alex Morgan with this move

177
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,112
on her 30th birthday.

178
00:07:03,112 --> 00:07:04,725
- [Sports Announcer]
Grand, setting it in there,

179
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:06,058
hey there, goal!

180
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,670
- [Adrienne] At home, fans
glued to their screens

181
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:11,697
from Brooklyn to Chicago to Los Angeles.

182
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:13,257
- [Sports Announcer] (mumbles) goal!

183
00:07:13,257 --> 00:07:15,430
- [Adrienne] And just when
England thought it tied the game,

184
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:18,397
this call from the ref offsite, no goal.

185
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:21,433
- [Sports Announcer] Calling
the shot, safe by a minute.

186
00:07:21,433 --> 00:07:23,840
- [Adrienne] True American
grit captured in this moment.

187
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,900
USA goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher diving

188
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,990
to block this penalty kick.

189
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:31,520
- To see them win and go
to the World Cup finals,

190
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,133
whoo, I am so energized.

191
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:35,306
(Adrienne laughing)

192
00:07:35,306 --> 00:07:36,780
- It was quite a game, and
Adrienne Bankert was right there

193
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,760
for it all, she joins us
from outside the stadium

194
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,724
there in Lyon now.

195
00:07:39,724 --> 00:07:41,830
Adrienne, all eyes on Megan Rapinoe.

196
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,333
Is she expected to play on Sunday?

197
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,930
- Yes, she is.

198
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:50,390
The team confirms it was a
minor strain in her hamstring

199
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,220
but she will be on the field
on Sunday for the final.

200
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,760
And again, even in her absence,

201
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,920
you can tell from tonight's performance,

202
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,680
team USA has quite the rich roster.

203
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,513
Cecilia?

204
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:01,970
- They sure do, okay, Adrienne, thank you.

205
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:05,260
Back here at home now a new
report is fueling fresh outrage

206
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:08,460
about conditions inside those
migrant detention centers.

207
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,460
The department of Homeland
Security's own inspector general

208
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:15,196
found families held in overcrowded
rooms in one Texas center

209
00:08:15,196 --> 00:08:18,240
and standing room only for men at another.

210
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,640
One facility manager calling

211
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,220
the situation there "a ticking time bomb".

212
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,520
ABC's Will Carr reporting
again from the border tonight.

213
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,300
- [Will] Tonight we have
new images from inside

214
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,790
jam packed migrant holding
centers showing what the

215
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,600
government calls dangerous overcrowding.

216
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,680
One facility manager says
the situation is so dire

217
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,610
it's a "ticking time bomb".

218
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,630
The images are part of a Homeland
Security Inspector General

219
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,480
report just released today.

220
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,630
They found some adults wedged
into standing room only cells

221
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,820
for up to a week.

222
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,500
Others were held for up to
a month in these conditions.

223
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,300
You can see their hands
pressed against the windows.

224
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,600
They saw children with
no access to showers

225
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,930
and limited clothing.

226
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:59,807
In response, DHS says it
treats those in custody

227
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:02,480
"with the utmost dignity and respect",

228
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,237
adding, "the current migration
flow and the resulting

229
00:09:05,237 --> 00:09:07,039
"humanitarian crisis
are rapidly overwhelming

230
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:11,070
"the ability of the federal
government to respond".

231
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,640
Today, hundreds took to the
streets in cities across

232
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,080
the country calling for
the centers to close.

233
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,980
From Austin--

234
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,950
- [Protestor] Don't be
silent, ICE is violent.

235
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,310
- [Crowd] Don't be silent, ICE is violent.

236
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,507
- [Will] To Miami.

237
00:09:22,507 --> 00:09:24,260
- [Crowd] Close the camps now.

238
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,495
Close the camps now.

239
00:09:26,495 --> 00:09:28,558
- [Will] And here, next to
the border in San Diego.

240
00:09:28,558 --> 00:09:31,300
- [Protestor] No human
being will ever be illegal.

241
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,130
- [Will] The protests
come on the heels of that

242
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:36,380
Congressional delegation visit
to other Texas facilities

243
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,060
where no cameras are allowed,

244
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:41,480
but Representative Joaquin
Castro snuck in a cellphone

245
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,041
and captured this video.

246
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,790
(speaking in foreign language)

247
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:45,930
- [Translator] She doesn't
have that (mumbles).

248
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,822
- [Will] Showing women wrapped in

249
00:09:47,822 --> 00:09:49,360
blue sleeping bags on the ground.

250
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,610
The representatives spoke
with some of the women

251
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:53,660
against Border Patrol orders.

252
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,750
- They were separated from their children,

253
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,450
they've been there over 50 days.

254
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:01,560
- These women were being
told by CBP officers

255
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,050
to drink out of the toilet.

256
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,613
This is CBP on their best behavior.

257
00:10:05,613 --> 00:10:09,160
- And Will Carr joins us now
live from the US Mexico border,

258
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,510
Will, this new report has
already caught the attention

259
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,343
of Congress.

260
00:10:12,343 --> 00:10:14,020
Democrats are now calling on

261
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,943
immigration officials to testify?

262
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,510
- That's right, Cecilia,
they're moving fast.

263
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,360
They're planning on a hearing next week

264
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,670
where they'll have some tough questions

265
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:26,140
about the conditions we're
seeing inside of those centers.

266
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,630
They're also planning on looking

267
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:30,030
at that secret Facebook
group that's been linked

268
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,000
to Border Patrol that had
some disgusting comments

269
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,535
about both migrants and about politicians.

270
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:36,368
Cecilia?

271
00:10:36,368 --> 00:10:38,260
- Will on this story again
for us tonight, thank you.

272
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,150
Now, to a major development late today

273
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,080
involving the 2020 census.

274
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,250
The Department of Justice
confirming the survey

275
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,180
will be printed without
that controversial question

276
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,820
about US citizenship.

277
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,930
Just yesterday President
Trump said he was looking

278
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:54,490
into delaying the census
so his administration

279
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,700
could include the citizen question,

280
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,050
no word on the reason
for this sudden reversal.

281
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,830
We'll turn now to that growing backlash

282
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:04,220
over President Trump's 4th of July plans.

283
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:07,020
A parade, a concert and
a show of military force

284
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,240
taking place in the nation's capitol.

285
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,290
These tanks are on their way from

286
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,400
Fort Stewart, Georgia by rail.

287
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,780
The president says it's
to honor the military,

288
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,502
but there are questions about
just how much it will cost

289
00:11:18,502 --> 00:11:21,240
and whether his speech
from the Lincoln Memorial

290
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,270
will turn the holiday
into a partisan event.

291
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:26,630
Here's ABC's chief global
affairs correspondent,

292
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,713
Martha Raddatz.

293
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,614
- [Martha] At the Lincoln Memorial today,

294
00:11:30,614 --> 00:11:33,460
workers hanging bunting

295
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,970
and setting up the presidential podium

296
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,940
for President Trump's unusual 4th of July

297
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,330
address to the nation.

298
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,480
- It's gonna be about this country

299
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,640
and it's a salute to America.

300
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,779
- [Martha] A salute where the
military will play a big part.

301
00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:49,230
(patriotic music)

302
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:53,660
The president has been fixated
on a grand military display

303
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:57,620
since he saw the Bastille
Day celebration in France.

304
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,710
Thursday's event on the National Mall

305
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:04,180
will include military units
and flyovers by Air Force One

306
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,580
and the Blue Angels.

307
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:09,500
- The best fighter jets in the
world and other planes, too.

308
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,570
And we're gonna have some
tanks stationed outside.

309
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:15,920
- [Martha] Those tanks
spotted today in Washington

310
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,400
to the dismay of the city council,

311
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,960
which tweeted, "Tanks, but no tanks".

312
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,150
They worry all the military hardware,

313
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:26,260
even though the 60 ton
tanks will be stationary,

314
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,370
will damage the National Mall.

315
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:30,490
- He is not respecting the traditions

316
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:33,370
of this city and region
and it is much resented.

317
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:34,850
- [Martha] The administration won't say

318
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,520
how much this will cost,

319
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,770
the White House insists the extravaganza

320
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:42,920
is about patriotism, not politics.

321
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,910
And it is open to the public,
although some VIP tickets

322
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:49,480
have been given to the
Republican National Committee

323
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,430
to hand out.

324
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:53,380
So far, nothing for Democrats.

325
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,700
- Okay, Martha Raddatz joins
us now from Washington.

326
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,480
And Martha, the president
tweeting today that

327
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,240
the Pentagon and top
military leaders are thrilled

328
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,360
to be doing this.

329
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,360
Is that what you're
hearing from your sources?

330
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,690
- Well, Cecilia, this is a
time when there are concerns

331
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,490
about the military being politicized,

332
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,970
and some I have talked
to say there is a whiff

333
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,099
of politics in this.

334
00:13:11,099 --> 00:13:14,450
The head of Iraq and
Afghanistan Veterans of America

335
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:18,200
saying this has the potential
to divide and polarize

336
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,352
and is the very opposite
of what this holiday

337
00:13:20,352 --> 00:13:21,890
should exemplify.

338
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:22,723
Cecilia?

339
00:13:22,723 --> 00:13:23,700
- Martha Raddatz, thank you.

340
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,800
Overseas now, Russia's
defense ministry is reporting

341
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,620
a deadly fire onboard a
secret Russian submarine.

342
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:33,570
14 crew members killed including
seven decorated captains.

343
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:37,120
The fire taking place on one
of the Navy's nuclear powered

344
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,540
deep sea subs in the Pacific.

345
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,610
The submarine has been towed
back to a Russian port.

346
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:46,260
And back here now, where Nike
is facing a major backlash

347
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,700
after canceling the
release of a new sneaker

348
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,180
that features the so
called "Betsy Ross" flag

349
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,420
over its perceived link
to an era of slavery.

350
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,790
And tonight, Nike could be
facing some unexpected costs.

351
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,746
Here's ABC's Gio Benitez.

352
00:13:59,746 --> 00:14:03,120
- [Gio] Tonight, Nike yanking
this Betsy Ross flag shoe

353
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,960
following public criticism
and a direct appeal

354
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,460
from Colin Kaepernick.

355
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,500
The sneakers were
supposed to launch Monday,

356
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,300
but Kaepernick, one of the
brand's most recognizable

357
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,670
and controversial faces intervened,

358
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:17,310
reportedly telling execs that the design,

359
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:19,930
featuring the 13 stars and stripes version

360
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:23,550
of the American flag was
considered offensive to some,

361
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:27,050
"because of its connection
to an era of slavery".

362
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:30,510
Conservatives immediately
taking on Nike and Kaepernick.

363
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,480
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell

364
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,090
critical of the decision.

365
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,820
- If we're in a political
environment where the

366
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:40,095
American flag has become
controversial to Americans,

367
00:14:40,095 --> 00:14:41,920
I think we got a problem.

368
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,280
- And Arizona governor Doug Ducey tweeting

369
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,837
that he's pulling roughly $2 million worth

370
00:14:46,837 --> 00:14:49,930
of financial incentives
that were meant for Nike's

371
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,592
new manufacturing plant there.

372
00:14:51,592 --> 00:14:54,877
And Cecilia, in a statement,
Nike tells ABC News

373
00:14:54,877 --> 00:14:57,410
it made the decision to halt distribution

374
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,130
of its 4th of July shoes based on concerns

375
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:03,240
that it could unintentionally
offend or detract

376
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,263
from the nation's patriotic holiday.

377
00:15:05,263 --> 00:15:06,310
Cecilia?

378
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,560
- Gio Benitez, thank you.

379
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,430
Now, to new developments
in the mystery surrounding

380
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:12,460
the death of Angels' pitcher Tyler Skaggs.

381
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:15,450
The 27 year old found dead
in his hotel room in Texas.

382
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:19,100
Authorities now ruling
out suicide and foul play.

383
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,040
So many paying tribute
today, some leaving flowers

384
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,090
outside the stadium there in Anaheim.

385
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:27,000
The Angels and the Rangers
taking the field tonight.

386
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,782
ABC's Marcus Moore is there.

387
00:15:28,782 --> 00:15:30,760
- [Marcus] Tonight the Texas Rangers

388
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,850
say they will hold a moment

389
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:34,010
of silence before tonight's game against

390
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:37,340
the Los Angeles Angels in
honor of pitcher Tyler Skaggs.

391
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,000
- These guys will be there
fighting for each other

392
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,413
with Tyler weighing heavy
on their hearts tonight.

393
00:15:44,413 --> 00:15:45,780
- [Sports Announcer] Tyler
Skaggs taking the mound

394
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,770
for the Angels.

395
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,800
- The seemingly healthy 27 year old

396
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,340
who wore number 45 seen
here pitching against

397
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,070
the Oakland As over the weekend.

398
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:55,140
Skaggs, who was supposed
to play in Thursday's

399
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:58,750
4th of July game was found
dead inside the team hotel.

400
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,820
His death still a mystery,
police telling ABC News

401
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,630
an autopsy has been
completed and so far there is

402
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:08,060
no evidence to suggest
foul play or suicide.

403
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,070
Just outside the hotel where he died,

404
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,910
flowers and a cap in his memory,

405
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:15,020
and a growing memorial outside
the Angels' home stadium.

406
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,480
Teammates, family and fans stunned.

407
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,680
- Today's one of the hardest days,

408
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:23,413
and I know it gets easier
but it's difficult.

409
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:28,210
- Skaggs leaves behind
his wife Carli Miles

410
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,410
whom he married this past New Year's Eve

411
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:31,713
just seven months ago.

412
00:16:31,713 --> 00:16:34,950
And Cecilia, authorities say
it could take up to 90 days

413
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:37,070
to get the results back of that autopsy,

414
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:39,730
so until then it's a mystery
as to how this young man

415
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:41,740
died in the prime of his career.

416
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,573
Cecilia?

417
00:16:42,573 --> 00:16:43,580
- Okay, Marcus, thank you.

418
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,370
There is still much more
ahead on World News Tonight

419
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:48,230
this Tuesday, the shark
scare off the Florida coast.

420
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:51,120
The family in the water, they
have no idea what's lurking

421
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,950
just a few feet away.

422
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,840
And news tonight about an airline mix up,

423
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,790
the child traveling alone overseas,

424
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:59,530
the parents claiming the
airline put him on the wrong

425
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:00,920
connecting flight.

426
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,130
And the total eclipse turning
the skies dark, thousands

427
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,153
of Americans flocking to see it.

428
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:11,100
- The fact is, every insurance company

429
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,000
hopes you drive safely,

430
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,740
but Allstate actually
helps you drive safely.

431
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,220
With Drivewise.

432
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,092
It lets you know when you go too fast.

433
00:17:19,092 --> 00:17:19,950
(tires screeching)

434
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:20,896
And brake too hard.

435
00:17:20,896 --> 00:17:22,260
(brakes squealing)

436
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,730
With feedback to help you drive safer,

437
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:27,803
giving you the power to
actually lower your cost.

438
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:33,023
Unfortunately, we can't
do anything about that.

439
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,206
Now that you know the truth,

440
00:17:35,206 --> 00:17:36,540
(horn honking)

441
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,773
are you in good hands?

442
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:42,930
- [Teacher] I'm 52, but
in my mind, I'm still 25.

443
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,100
That's why I take Osteo Bi-Flex,

444
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,290

445
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:50,500
It nourishes and strengthens
my joints for the long term.

446
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,670
- [Narrator] Osteo Bi-Flex,

447
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:53,890

448
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:56,060
- Fact, we all love video door bells.

449
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,270
Voice assistants have changed our lives.

450
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:00,010
We now control our home with a touch.

451
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:01,530
And you know what's better
than all of these things

452
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:02,363
by themselves?

453
00:18:02,363 --> 00:18:03,500
- All of these things combined.

454
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,640

Ensure, for strength and energy.

465
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,930
- I would get muscle
cramps several times a week

466

- [Announcer] Your brain
changes as you get older,

471
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,640
but Prevagen helps your
brain with an ingredient

472
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,300
originally discovered in jellyfish.

473
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,530
In clinical trials,
Prevagen has been shown

474
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,830

Prevagen, healthier brain, better life.

476
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:56,090
- I switched to MiraLax
for my constipation.

477
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:58,000
Stimulant laxatives forcefully stimulate

478
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,250
the nerves in your colon.

479
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,990
MiraLax works with the water in your body

480
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,663
to unblock your system naturally,

481
00:19:03,712 --> 00:19:04,545
and it doesn't cause bloating, cramping,

482
00:19:04,545 --> 00:19:06,370
gas or sudden urgency.

483
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:08,223
MiraLax, look for the pink cap.

484
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,100
- Next tonight, a parents' nightmare.

485
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,940
Their son traveling alone to Sweden,

486
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,000
escorted by United Airlines,

487
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,930
but when he changed planes in New Jersey

488
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:20,510
the boy was instead put
on a flight to Germany.

489
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,903
Here's ABC's David Kerley.

490
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:24,780
- [David] This is the picture delayed,

491
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,610
when this 14 year old from
Raleigh, North Carolina

492
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:30,430
was put on the wrong plane in Newark.

493
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:33,970
Tonight, United Airlines is
apologizing to his family.

494
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:36,860
A United employee
apparently did not realize

495
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,000
the boy's flight to Sweden had
been moved to another gate.

496
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,250
But still a mystery
tonight, how was Anton Berg

497
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,760
able to get onto a Eurowings
jet headed to Germany?

498
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,370
- They simply failed to
double and cross reference

499
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:53,325
his documents with who
they perceived he was.

500
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:56,990
The wrong kid at the wrong
gate with the wrong airline.

501
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,850
- It was the 14 year old who realized

502
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:00,490
the mistake, because a lot of passengers

503
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,590
were speaking German.

504
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:04,530
He texted his parents,
his mom started tweeting,

505
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:06,720
begging United to stop the flight.

506
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,160
It was the 14 year old
who told the flight crew

507
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,750
about the mistake before
takeoff, and the Eurowings jet

508
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,240
returned to the gate.

509
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,330
Anton had to wait for another
flight to get to Sweden

510
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:20,060
where he was finally
met by his grandmother.

511
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,670
United said in a statement
that it has been in touch

512
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:26,470
with the family to ensure
the safety of the 14 year old

513
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,510
and apologizes for the event.

514
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,343
Cecilia?

515
00:20:29,343 --> 00:20:30,240
- David Kerley, thank you.

516
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,310
When we come back, the
scare off the coast,

517
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,260
a family in the water,

518
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,360
the danger right there,
just a few feet away.

519
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,733
And NASA takes a big step
towards returning to the moon.

520
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:45,470
- [DVT Patient] After my
DVT blood clot, I wondered,

521
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,290
is another one around the corner,

522
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:49,080
or could it be different than I thought?

523
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,040
I wanted to help protect myself.

524
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,043
My doctor recommended Eliquis.

525
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:56,080
Eliquis is proven to
treat and help prevent

526
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,620
another DVT or PE blood clot.

527
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,730
Almost 98% of patients on
Eliquis didn't experience

528
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:05,170
another, and Eliquis has
significantly less major bleeding

529
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,220
than the standard treatment.

530
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,810
Eliquis is FDA approved and has both.

531
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,060
- [Announcer] Don't stop Eliquis unless

532
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,230
your doctor tells you to.

533
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:14,300
Eliquis can cause serious and
in rare cases fatal bleeding.

534
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,690
Don't take Eliquis if you
have an artificial heart valve

535
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:17,850
or abnormal bleeding.

536
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,910
If you had a spinal
injection while on Eliquis,

537
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,770
call your doctor right
away if you have tingling,

538
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:23,100
numbness or muscle weakness.

539
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,440
While taking Eliquis, you
may bruise more easily

540
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,750
and it may take longer than
usual for bleeding to stop.

541
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,090
Seek immediate medical care
for sudden signs of bleeding

542
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,300
like unusual bruising.

543
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,390
Eliquis may increase your
bleeding risk if you take

544
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,223
certain medicines.

545
00:21:34,223 --> 00:21:36,110
Tell your doctor about all planned medical

546
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,230
or dental procedures.

547
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,170
- [DVT Patient] What's around the corner

548
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,760
could be surprising.

549
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,663
Ask your doctor about Eliquis.

550
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,513
- Let's be honest.

551
00:21:43,513 --> 00:21:44,700
You only talk about your insurance

552
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,010
when you complain about it.

553
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:46,843
- [Patient] Ah ha, ah ha.

554
00:21:46,843 --> 00:21:47,676
- Good point.

555
00:21:47,676 --> 00:21:49,770
That's why Esurance is
making the whole experience

556
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:50,750
surprisingly painless,

557
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,450
so you never have to talk about it

558
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,415
unless you're the spokesperson.

559
00:21:54,415 --> 00:21:57,740
Esurance, it's surprisingly painless.

560
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:00,657
(tires screeching)

561
00:22:02,746 --> 00:22:05,481
(engine revving)

562
00:22:05,481 --> 00:22:07,898
(rock music)

563
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,406
- [Announcer] Always there in crunch time.

564
00:22:13,406 --> 00:22:15,823
(horn music)

565
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,770
- I got a certain way I like to do things.

566
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:31,430
I like Consumer Cellular.

567
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:35,240
I get unlimited talk and
text for just $25 a month.

568
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,750
With no contract.

569
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,070
They received the J.D.
Power award for highest

570
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:41,140
customer service again.

571
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,520
- And Consumer Cellular
has been an approved

572
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,730
AARP provider since
2008, so we trust them.

573
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:50,120
Reliable, nationwide
coverage for way less money?

574
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,619
That's the way--

575
00:22:51,619 --> 00:22:52,690
- We like it.

576
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:54,470
- [Narrator] Get wireless
the way you like it.

577
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,653
Call, go online, or find us at Target.

578
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,160
- [Dog] My new Beneful Superfood Blend

579
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,810
has me feeling super healthy.

580
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:03,970
With salmon, cranberries,
oh, but we are not done yet.

581
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:06,920
Here comes Superfood Wet, with
beef, salmon, and pumpkin.

582
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,680
It's like a superfood sundae.

583
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,700
On a Monday!

584
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,270
- [Narrator] New Beneful Superfood Blend,

585
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,633
dry and wet recipes.

586
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:14,803
- To The Index, now.

587
00:23:14,803 --> 00:23:16,170
Starting with the shark attack off

588
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:17,610
New Smyrna Beach, Florida.

589
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:20,770
Police say an 18 year old
surfer was bitten on the leg.

590
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,780
The injury was not serious.

591
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,120
And in that same area,
just a week earlier,

592
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,510
a shark lurking near this family.

593
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:29,850
The father flying a drone spotted it.

594
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:32,570
He immediately yelled for
his wife and three children

595
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:34,070
to get back to the beach.

596
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,530
You will hear from the
father on tonight's Nightline

597
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:38,780
and tomorrow on GMA.

598
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:41,200
Next, the deadly fireworks
accident in Toledo.

599
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,650
Police say a man was killed
by lighting large fireworks

600
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:48,680
in his front yard with neighborhood
children there watching.

601
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,333
He accidentally set off a mortar

602
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:54,200
facing in the wrong direction
and was struck in the chest.

603
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,520
And from the earth to the moon.

604
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,290
NASA clearing a major hurdle
with the successful launch

605
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:01,290
of it's Orion capsule today.

606
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:04,470
The unmanned capsule blasting
off from Cape Canaveral

607
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:06,480
on top of a peacekeeper missile,

608
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,840
safely splashing down in the Atlantic.

609
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,870
Orion is designed to take astronauts

610
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:13,470
back to the moon by 2024.

611
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:16,370
When we come back, the rare
event in the sky visible

612
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:19,963
only from two countries
and an uninhabited island.

613
00:24:21,602 --> 00:24:24,252
- [Announcer] ABC World News
Tonight with David Muir,

614
00:24:25,493 --> 00:24:26,893
sponsored in part by Humira.

615
00:24:28,351 --> 00:24:29,184
(alarm buzzing)

616
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,860
- [Announcer] This is your wake up call.

617
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:33,850
If you have moderate to
severe rheumatoid arthritis,

618
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:36,210
month after month the clock is ticking

619
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:38,150
on irreversible joint damage.

620
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:41,950
Ongoing pain and stiffness
are signs of joint erosion.

621
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:44,090
Humira can help stop the clock.

622
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:47,080
Prescribed for 15 years,
Humira targets and blocks

623
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,740
a source of inflammation that
contributes to joint pain

624
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,010
and irreversible damage.

625
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:53,310
- [Announcer] Humira
can lower your ability

626
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,800
to fight infections.

627
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,680
Serious and sometimes fatal infections

628
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,350
including tuberculosis and
cancers including lymphoma

629
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,970
have happened, as have blood,

630
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,860
liver, and nervous system problems.

631
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,390
Serious allergic reactions and

632
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:05,907
new or worsening heart failure.

633
00:25:05,907 --> 00:25:08,470
Tell your doctor if you've
been to areas where certain

634
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:11,180
fungal infections are
common and if you've had TB,

635
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,250
Hepatitis B, are prone to infections

636
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,650
or have flu like symptoms or sores.

637
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:17,850
Don't start Humira if
you have an infection.

- Each year Americans waste $21 billion

659
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,920
by overpaying on car insurance.

660
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,850
That's why I went to TheZebra.com.

661
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:06,310
Because while every company claims

662

00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,050

(piano music)

669
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,990
- [Announcer] Corey is living
with metastatic breast cancer,

670
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:28,160
which is breast cancer that
has spread to other parts

671
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:28,993
of her body.

672
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:33,280
She's also taking Ibrance
with an aromatase inhibitor,

673
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,690
which is for postmenopausal
women or for men

674
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:38,890
with HR+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer

675
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:41,200
as the first hormonal based therapy.

676
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,950
Ibrance plus letrozole was
significantly more effective

677
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:46,840
at delaying disease
progression versus letrozole.

678
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,620
Patients taking Ibrance can develop

679
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,530
low white blood cell
counts which may cause

680
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:52,730
serious infections that can lead to death.

681
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:55,450
Before taking Ibrance, tell
your doctor if you have fever,

682
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:57,390
chills or other signs of infection,

683
00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:00,030
liver or kidney problems,
are pregnant, breastfeeding,

684
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,490
or plan to become pregnant.

685
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:03,740
Common side effects
include low red blood cell

686
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:06,300
and low platelet counts,
infections, tiredness,

687
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:09,580
nausea, sore mouth, abnormalities
in liver blood tests,

688
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:12,450
diarrhea, hair thinning
or loss, vomiting, rash,

689
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:14,300
and loss of appetite.

690
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:18,090
Corey calls it her new normal,
because a lot has changed,

691
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:19,563
but a lot hasn't.

692
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:23,310
Ask your doctor about Ibrance,
the number one prescribed

693
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:28,253
FDA approved oral combination
treatment for HR+ HER2- MBC.

694
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:31,930
- [Robin] Imagine a good
morning spent with friends.

695
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:33,360
What's better than that?

696
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,320
Imagine knowing what's
coming next in the day ahead.

697
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,340
Well, I get to live this each morning.

698
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,990
Together with you, imagine that.

699
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:44,313
And that's what makes it
such a Good Morning America.

700
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:48,420
- Finally, tonight a
stunning show in the sky

701
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,850
that only a small part
of the world could see,

702
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:53,290
including our Rob Marciano.

703
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:55,660
- This is the moment day became night

704
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,980
in South America.

705
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:00,850
There it is, we have totality.

706
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:02,530
The moon passing perfectly between

707
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:05,430
the Earth and the sun,
a bullseye blocking out

708
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:07,923
all but the glowing edge
of the sun's corona,

709
00:28:08,881 --> 00:28:10,640
the hills and valley around us going dark.

710
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,053
It's gotten so dark you can see stars,

711
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,740
and it's cold.

712
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:17,100
Temperatures have dropped
a good 10 degrees in

713
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,430
the last 20 minutes.

714
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:21,690
The moon's shadow sweeping
along a nearly 7000 mile path

715
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:24,230
across the Pacific,
hitting the coast of Chile

716
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:26,310
at 4:38 PM.

717
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:28,500
Nightfall for two and a half minutes.

718
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,220
You hear the birds?

719
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,600
The birds are confused.

720
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,700
It's the first one since the
coast to coast US eclipse

721
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,230
of 2017,

722
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:39,235
and many Americans traveled
here to see another.

723
00:28:39,235 --> 00:28:42,830
- Totality's very spiritual
for a lot of people,

724
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:46,190
and once you see one, you
wanna see the next one.

725
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:47,120
- [Rob] Why the allure?

726
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,014
- It's a multisensory experience unlike

727
00:28:49,014 --> 00:28:51,270
anything else nature has to offer.

728
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,600
- The next total solar eclipse in the US?

729
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,144
April 2024.

730
00:28:55,144 --> 00:28:56,170
Cecilia?

731
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:58,000
- Well, we'll be waiting,
okay, thank you Rob.

732
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,130
Thank you for watching, I'm Cecilia Vega

733
