A time of differing memories.

11
00:00:24,341 --> 00:00:26,169
- The '80s were the time of my life.

12
00:00:26,169 --> 00:00:28,658
- You're just survivin' in this state,

13
00:00:28,658 --> 00:00:30,599
like complete nothingness.

We were just crazy.
- All right!

17
00:00:35,904 --> 00:00:38,154
- If you can't move to go-go,
you weren't meant to move.

18

great cosmopolitan world capital.

00:00:51,277 --> 00:00:54,802
pretty smart to the next day a buffoon.

25
00:00:54,802 --> 00:00:56,402
- [Narrator] And death.

26
00:00:56,402 --> 00:00:59,291
- We'd have shootings, but
you'd have overdose deaths.

27
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:03,632
- I personally had a huge
number of friends that I lost.

28
00:01:03,632 --> 00:01:06,690
- [Narrator] And a mayor
who defined the city.

29
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,232
- That little white powder

30
00:01:08,232 --> 00:01:09,482
is so powerful.

31
00:01:11,521 --> 00:01:14,961

still rebuilding after the '68 riots.

38
00:01:39,198 --> 00:01:41,189
- I think the residents
were feeling hopeful.

39
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:43,298
We had a new mayor.

40
00:01:43,298 --> 00:01:46,048
I think there was a good feeling.

41
00:01:46,976 --> 00:01:51,024
We were all just coming off
of the Civil Rights era,

42
00:01:51,024 --> 00:01:55,107
and so the community was
building and coexisting.

43
00:01:55,944 --> 00:01:58,656
- We'd just had home rule for a few years,

44
00:01:58,656 --> 00:02:00,490
and it just sounded like
everything was gonna be great.

Of course, it wasn't.

was still a city divided.

00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:12,366
- One black city and one white city.

49
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:16,387
One city in poverty,
and one city doing well.

- [Narrator] Middle class white flight

51
00:02:17,779 --> 00:02:21,557
meant the 172,000 white
residents who remained

52
00:02:21,557 --> 00:02:23,886
tended to be above average income,

53
00:02:23,886 --> 00:02:27,946
and live in the city's
leafier Northwest suburbs.

54
00:02:27,946 --> 00:02:30,352
- And where the white wards,
that were quote-unquote,

55
00:02:30,352 --> 00:02:33,146
received anything they want,
and there was the other wards,

56
00:02:33,146 --> 00:02:37,744
the forgotten wards, that
were out there hanging out.

who made up 70% of the city's residents,

59
00:02:42,043 --> 00:02:44,203
tended to live and work in the poorer

60
00:02:44,203 --> 00:02:47,603

who made sure the doors were locked.

65

You know, everything was boarded up,

66
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:05,440
downtown was a lot of
crime, it was a scary place.

67
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,591
- There was some hope
that that would change,

68
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:11,769
but there was nothing yet
that gave an indication

found himself in a similar
state of stagnation.

- It is a crisis of confidence.

74

- Four hostages had been taken in Iran,

75
00:03:29,803 --> 00:03:33,462
we had 21% interest rates, 13% inflation.

76
00:03:33,462 --> 00:03:36,113
- Washington was, as it is now,

00:03:36,113 --> 00:03:38,931
a predominantly Democratic town,

78
00:03:38,931 --> 00:03:42,917

Reagan took the Oath of Office,

Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran
released all 52 hostages.

92
00:04:13,465 --> 00:04:14,436
(crowd cheers)
- I am convinced

93
00:04:14,436 --> 00:04:16,516
they suspected that Ronald Reagan

94
00:04:16,516 --> 00:04:18,887
would give them 48 hours,

95
00:04:18,887 --> 00:04:21,156
and if the hostages
weren't on the way home,

96
00:04:21,156 --> 00:04:22,807
there would be military action.

97

(crowd cheers)
(marching band plays)

98
00:04:25,236 --> 00:04:26,524
- [Narrator] Though Washingtonians

99
00:04:26,524 --> 00:04:28,036
were excited to welcome the hostages,

100
00:04:28,036 --> 00:04:32,024
most didn't the feel the
same about the new President.

101
00:04:32,024 --> 00:04:35,047
- Depressed would be a
good way of describing

102
00:04:35,047 --> 00:04:37,876
the fact that Ronald Reagan
was bringing with him

103
00:04:37,876 --> 00:04:40,376
a whole new political culture.

104
00:04:42,384 --> 00:04:44,524
- [Man] There were fur
coats all over the place.

105
00:04:44,524 --> 00:04:47,946
There was a perception that
the California conservatives

106
00:04:47,946 --> 00:04:50,924
who came were a pretty rich crowd,

107
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:54,175
and not very much in touch
with the average folks.

108
00:04:54,175 --> 00:04:55,706
("Take On Me" by A-ha)

109
00:04:55,706 --> 00:04:58,226
- I think that the gay
community at that time

110
00:04:58,226 --> 00:05:02,145
had an understandable
amount of trepidation.

111
00:05:02,145 --> 00:05:04,574
You know, what was this
President gonna be like?

112
00:05:04,574 --> 00:05:07,774
- I gave Reagan all the
attention he deserved.

113
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:10,070
He was not the friend of the city.

114
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,380
- [Narrator] Others were more welcoming.

115
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,928
- From the election, there
were one-word difference

116
00:05:13,928 --> 00:05:16,276
between president and resident,

117
00:05:16,276 --> 00:05:17,267
and he wanted to bridge the gap

118
00:05:17,267 --> 00:05:19,165
between resident and president,

119
00:05:19,165 --> 00:05:21,349
and I believe that, and I appreciate that,

120
00:05:21,349 --> 00:05:23,162
because I'm the mayor of the city,

121
00:05:23,162 --> 00:05:25,178
and he's gonna be one of my constituents.

122
00:05:25,178 --> 00:05:27,848
- I think he knew more about
how Washington functioned

123
00:05:27,848 --> 00:05:30,295
than a lot of other presidents.

124
00:05:30,295 --> 00:05:32,754
He was the only president that I've known

125
00:05:32,754 --> 00:05:37,754
who actually invited the
local media to meet with him.

126
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,322
- When Reagan came to town,

127
00:05:40,322 --> 00:05:43,881
that arts beat and entertainment
beat just exploded,

128
00:05:43,881 --> 00:05:45,736
because Reagan brought all of his

129
00:05:45,736 --> 00:05:48,581
showbiz connections to town.

130
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:53,030
They had his first inauguration,
they had this huge event.

(Ray Charles sings)

132
00:05:58,222 --> 00:05:59,798
And Reagan set the tone

133
00:05:59,798 --> 00:06:03,433
for movies and show
business in Washington.

134

(soft jazz music)

135
00:06:04,953 --> 00:06:07,092
- Washington was emerging

136
00:06:07,092 --> 00:06:10,556
as the great cosmopolitan
world capital it is today.

137
00:06:10,556 --> 00:06:12,205
It was a great time in America

138
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,062
and it was a great time
for the Reaganauts.

139
00:06:15,062 --> 00:06:18,191
- [Narrator] Until March 30th, 1981.

00:06:18,191 --> 00:06:19,537

00:06:19,537 --> 00:06:20,995

(woman shrieking)
(background murmuring)

144
00:06:23,933 --> 00:06:26,285
As Reagan was leaving
the Washington Hilton,

145
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:28,962
John Hinckley, Jr. fired six times.

146
00:06:28,962 --> 00:06:30,726
(men shouting)
- Get up!

147
00:06:30,726 --> 00:06:33,115
One shot hit press secretary James Brady

148
00:06:33,115 --> 00:06:35,352
critically wounding him.

149
00:06:35,352 --> 00:06:37,777
Another ricocheted off
the presidential limousine

150
00:06:37,777 --> 00:06:39,860
lodging in Reagan's lung.

151
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,069
- [Reporter] What are you
gonna do when you get home?

152
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,229

(crowd cheering)

155
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,353

Reagan was back at work.

("Take On Me" by A-ha)

157
00:06:53,975 --> 00:06:57,324
And the Washington Hilton had a nickname.

158
00:06:57,324 --> 00:06:59,938
- Meet me over there by the Hilton.

159
00:06:59,938 --> 00:07:01,779
Oh, the Hinckley Hilton.

160
00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:03,118
- The Hinckley Hilton.

161
00:07:03,118 --> 00:07:05,428
I don't think I've ever
driven by that hotel

00:07:05,428 --> 00:07:07,595
without thinking about it.

163
00:07:09,239 --> 00:07:10,226
- [Narrator] Back at his desk,

164
00:07:10,226 --> 00:07:12,084
the president worked
with his administration

165
00:07:12,084 --> 00:07:15,581
to fulfill his campaign
promise to cut spending.

166
00:07:15,581 --> 00:07:17,723
Growing discontent with
existing treatments

167
00:07:17,723 --> 00:07:21,315
prompted cuts in mental health services.

168
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:25,143
- You began to see large
numbers of panhandlers

169
00:07:25,143 --> 00:07:27,170
appearing on the streets of Washington.

170
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,851
(man laughs)
(soft music)

171
00:07:29,851 --> 00:07:32,780
- Bein' D.C. where the president reside,

172
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,408
he was thinkin' we shouldn't
have some places like this.

173
00:07:36,408 --> 00:07:38,393
(birds squawking)

174
00:07:38,393 --> 00:07:43,378
- I walk the streets, and I
sleep on the goddamn streets.

175
00:07:43,378 --> 00:07:46,057
(soft music)

176
00:07:46,057 --> 00:07:47,967
- [Narrator] Many district
homeless were veterans

177
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,783
damaged by their experiences in Vietnam,

178
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:53,364
fighting an unpopular war.

(crowd cheering)

182
00:08:05,058 --> 00:08:06,757
- Didn't even have to go.

183
00:08:06,757 --> 00:08:08,173
I wanted to go.

184
00:08:08,173 --> 00:08:09,487
Everything I put my heart into,

00:08:15,364 --> 00:08:17,939
- [Narrator] In 1980, Congress
authorized construction

188
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:21,136
of a Vietnam memorial on the Mall.

189
00:08:21,136 --> 00:08:23,101
Following a nationwide competition,

190
00:08:23,101 --> 00:08:26,573
the design for a sunken
reflective black granite wall

191
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:30,926
by Maya Lin, a 21-year-old
college student, was selected.

192
00:08:30,926 --> 00:08:35,926
- It was so simple and so
direct that it was incredible.

193
00:08:36,106 --> 00:08:39,015
- [Narrator] But not everyone
was happy with the design.

194
00:08:39,015 --> 00:08:41,766
- I said this doesn't look
like something honoring

195
00:08:41,766 --> 00:08:44,942
these people's service
and there was a tremendous

196
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:48,765
cultural artistic debate
that went on in this town

197
00:08:48,765 --> 00:08:50,236
and a lot of people felt

198
00:08:50,236 --> 00:08:53,449
are they dishonoring
the vets by doing this?

199
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:54,467
- [Narrator] Eventually the design

200
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:58,426
for the memorial was amended
and three soldiers were added,

201
00:08:58,426 --> 00:09:00,799
but on its opening in 1982,

202
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:04,328
the strength of the original
design became evident.

203
00:09:04,328 --> 00:09:07,666
- I'm here to pay eulogy and
homage to all of my comrades

204
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,603
didn't make it back with me.

205
00:09:09,603 --> 00:09:12,497
- I think they wanted
something more heroic

206
00:09:12,497 --> 00:09:16,913
but I think they got something
that was even more profound.

207
00:09:16,913 --> 00:09:18,929
- I think what turned it
around was not the black walls,

208
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:22,059
it's the names on the walls.

209
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:24,809
And I will say it turned out from

210
00:09:25,678 --> 00:09:28,085
the way that thing's been received

211
00:09:28,085 --> 00:09:30,214
that I was wrong on that one.

212
00:09:30,214 --> 00:09:32,345
Wrong, big time.

213
00:09:32,345 --> 00:09:34,960
- And I love the American
people for being here

214
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,996
and just saying thank you,

215
00:09:36,996 --> 00:09:40,823
because that's all we
want, is to hear that.

216
00:09:40,823 --> 00:09:43,406
(upbeat music)

217
00:09:44,561 --> 00:09:45,472
- [Narrator] For more than a century,

218
00:09:45,472 --> 00:09:46,521
the city had supported

219
00:09:46,521 --> 00:09:49,840
two nationally recognized
daily newspapers,

220
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,360
the more progressive Washington Post

221
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,527
and more conservative Washington Star.

222
00:09:57,021 --> 00:10:00,952
But the recession and shrinking
demand for evening dailies

223
00:10:00,952 --> 00:10:03,987
forced the Star into bankruptcy in 1981.

224
00:10:03,987 --> 00:10:05,398
- TV killed 'em.

225
00:10:05,398 --> 00:10:06,993
People who watch the TV news go home,

226
00:10:06,993 --> 00:10:08,847
they don't sit there and read their paper.

227
00:10:08,847 --> 00:10:10,310
Click. (background chattering)

228
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,524
- For about a year and a half,

229
00:10:11,524 --> 00:10:15,357
we were a one-paper town,
and that was, I felt,

230
00:10:15,357 --> 00:10:17,515
a little dangerous.

231
00:10:17,515 --> 00:10:19,193
- [Narrator] But in a
sign of the growing clout

232
00:10:19,193 --> 00:10:22,513
of conservative voices, an upstart daily

233
00:10:22,513 --> 00:10:25,139
with an unwavering point of view

234
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:28,110
hit the newsstands in 1982.

235
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,569
- [Reporter] It's called
The Washington Times

236
00:10:29,569 --> 00:10:31,165
and it's owned by the publishing arm

237
00:10:31,165 --> 00:10:33,811
of the Reverend Moon's Unification church.

238
00:10:33,811 --> 00:10:37,960
- I wasn't excited to see the
moonie paper come around, no.

239
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:42,960
Reverend Moon was a great
Christian evangelist from Korea.

240
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:46,597
He obviously felt that
it would be nice to have

241
00:10:46,597 --> 00:10:49,354
a good mouthpiece in Washington.

242
00:10:49,354 --> 00:10:51,516
- My column used to appear
in The Washington Times

243
00:10:51,516 --> 00:10:54,058
on a regular, you know, twice a week,

244
00:10:54,058 --> 00:10:56,006
and every conservative read it.

245
00:10:56,006 --> 00:10:59,419
I mean, it was something we
had that we'd never had before.

246
00:10:59,419 --> 00:11:01,744
(upbeat music)
(motor humming)

247
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,897
(dramatic music)

248
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:05,802
- [Narrator] No one who
worked the newsrooms

249
00:11:05,802 --> 00:11:10,802
of Washington of the '80s can
forget January 13th, 1982.

250
00:11:11,236 --> 00:11:13,905
- I had just come across the
bridge in a blinding snowstorm

251
00:11:13,905 --> 00:11:17,727
and when I got 10 feet off
the bridge we heard a crunch.

252
00:11:17,727 --> 00:11:22,053
- [Narrator] At 4:01 p.m.,
Air Florida Flight 90

253
00:11:22,053 --> 00:11:24,269
crashed into the 14th Street bridge.

254
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:25,829
(propellers whirring)

255
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:28,710
- We get down there and we
don't really have a method

256
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:32,440
for dealing with that
kind of mass casualty.

257
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,566
The radio systems didn't
function like they should,

258
00:11:35,566 --> 00:11:38,351
we didn't have any place
to deal with the bodies.

259
00:11:38,351 --> 00:11:41,322
(dramatic music)

260
00:11:41,322 --> 00:11:44,321
- [Narrator] Passerby Lenny
Skutnik dove into the water

261
00:11:44,321 --> 00:11:46,509
to help save a drowning woman.

262
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:47,442
- [Reporter] We have just learned

263
00:11:47,442 --> 00:11:51,076
that that woman fighting to
survive in the icy Potomac

264
00:11:51,076 --> 00:11:53,638
was one of the stewardesses
on board the plane,

265
00:11:53,638 --> 00:11:55,917
her name Kelly Dunman.

266
00:11:55,917 --> 00:11:59,905
- He really symbolized I
think for a lot of people here

267
00:11:59,905 --> 00:12:02,091
that people wanted to help

268
00:12:02,091 --> 00:12:04,004
and were willing to help each other.

269
00:12:04,004 --> 00:12:05,978
(dramatic music)

270
00:12:05,978 --> 00:12:07,773
- [Narrator] 74 people on the plane

271
00:12:07,773 --> 00:12:10,575
and four on the bridge were killed.

272
00:12:10,575 --> 00:12:14,521
- One of my dearest
friends was on that plane.

273
00:12:14,521 --> 00:12:17,998
She was the mother of
three young children.

274
00:12:17,998 --> 00:12:20,610
I miss her to this day.
(sirens wailing)

275
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,141
- [Narrator] As word of the crash spread

276
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:25,135
and the Washington Press
corps descended on the scene,

277
00:12:25,135 --> 00:12:29,984
it became clear that another
tragedy had struck the region.

278
00:12:29,984 --> 00:12:31,719
- Reporters couldn't get there

279
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:34,727
because the Metro train also had derailed.

280
00:12:34,727 --> 00:12:37,107
- [Narrator] 30 minutes
after the plane crash

281
00:12:37,107 --> 00:12:40,237
an Orange Line train jumped
the tracks in a tunnel,

282
00:12:40,237 --> 00:12:42,001
near Federal Triangle.

283
00:12:42,001 --> 00:12:43,043
- [Reporter] Two women and a man

284
00:12:43,043 --> 00:12:45,551
whose names have not been
released were killed.

285
00:12:45,551 --> 00:12:49,708
- That forced the region
to think oh my goodness,

286
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,125
what do we do if?

287
00:12:54,643 --> 00:12:55,498
- So for some many of our--

288
00:12:55,498 --> 00:12:58,259
- [Narrator] By 1982,
Barry's first term as mayor

289
00:12:58,259 --> 00:12:59,992
was coming to a close.

290
00:12:59,992 --> 00:13:03,153
For the first time since
his election in 1978,

291
00:13:03,153 --> 00:13:06,086
voters were given the
chance to judge his record.

292
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:09,253
(funky, upbeat music)

293
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,260
- He was elected by whites.

294
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,752
As he won essentially

295
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:14,906
with the votes of people
(people singing)

296
00:13:14,906 --> 00:13:16,953
in wards one, three, two, and six.

297
00:13:16,953 --> 00:13:18,120
- And this is just the beginning

298
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,576
of what we're going to do here.

299
00:13:19,576 --> 00:13:20,870
- [Narrator] But once in power,

300
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:23,588
Barry knew that tying his political future

301
00:13:23,588 --> 00:13:27,044
to the city's white
residents was unsustainable.

302
00:13:27,044 --> 00:13:30,602
- He made an incredibly
prudent political decision

303
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:33,439
to switch his base to black,

304
00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:36,516
through minority contracting programs

305
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:37,710
and bringing black folks

306
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:41,472
into key positions in the government.

307
00:13:41,472 --> 00:13:44,726
- I can remember him saying, "Listen.

308
00:13:44,726 --> 00:13:47,058
"You're gonna be able to advance,

309
00:13:47,058 --> 00:13:49,587
"you got to get prepared for leadership,"

310
00:13:49,587 --> 00:13:52,056
and for somebody like me,

311
00:13:52,056 --> 00:13:55,195
I got to be chief because of Barry.

312
00:13:55,195 --> 00:13:57,127
- [Narrator] Barry used
the power of his position

313
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,961
to encourage the creation and development

314
00:13:59,961 --> 00:14:01,750
of African American owned businesses.

315
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,327
♪ We found the proper place ♪

316
00:14:03,327 --> 00:14:05,696
- And if you're gonna do business in D.C.,

317
00:14:05,696 --> 00:14:07,743
one of the first questions they'd ask you,

318
00:14:07,743 --> 00:14:11,282
do you have minority
participation in this deal?

319
00:14:11,282 --> 00:14:14,365
What came about was a philosophy that

320
00:14:15,398 --> 00:14:17,739
white business should partner up

321
00:14:17,739 --> 00:14:20,586
with qualified African
American business people

322
00:14:20,586 --> 00:14:22,317
and once you get a black city council

323
00:14:22,317 --> 00:14:24,428
all of a sudden the white
law firms start saying

324
00:14:24,428 --> 00:14:25,993
we're gonna have black partners,

325
00:14:25,993 --> 00:14:27,547
and some of the white
businesses start saying

326
00:14:27,547 --> 00:14:29,941
we have to have black lobbyists.

327
00:14:29,941 --> 00:14:31,537
- [Narrator] The increased flow of money

328
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,595
moving through the city's economy

329
00:14:33,595 --> 00:14:35,642
swelled the district's coffers,

330
00:14:35,642 --> 00:14:38,235
giving Barry the income
to spend on projects

331
00:14:38,235 --> 00:14:41,365
that benefited the city's poorer youth

332
00:14:41,365 --> 00:14:45,867
and build a base for the
rest of his political career.

333
00:14:45,867 --> 00:14:49,498
- My most memorable program
is the summer job program.

334
00:14:49,498 --> 00:14:52,128
Over a hundred thousand young people

335
00:14:52,128 --> 00:14:54,218
went through our summer job program.

336
00:14:54,218 --> 00:14:55,288
- I was just at some event

337
00:14:55,288 --> 00:14:58,551
and the guy who was in charge
of the people parking the cars

338
00:14:58,551 --> 00:15:00,758
came up to me, he says,
"I got my first job

339
00:15:00,758 --> 00:15:02,710
"in the Marion Barry summer job program."

340
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,886
He said, "Now I help to run this company."

341
00:15:04,886 --> 00:15:06,750
- That was the bomb.

342
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,525
You go down 500 C Street and
there's a long line of kids

343
00:15:09,525 --> 00:15:11,867
waitin' in line to get
their checks, you know.

344
00:15:11,867 --> 00:15:14,382
You would see them all downtown

345
00:15:14,382 --> 00:15:16,860
at The Go-Go at night. (laughing)

346
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,520
So, that was awesome, yes indeed.

347
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,765
- [Narrator] Recognizing
that the district's aging

348
00:15:21,765 --> 00:15:25,565
were underserved, Barry
also invested heavily

349
00:15:25,565 --> 00:15:27,897
in services for the elderly.

350
00:15:27,897 --> 00:15:29,366
- And the flip side of that for Barry was

351
00:15:29,366 --> 00:15:31,375
in addition to that being a good thing,

352
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:34,244
was that he would take
buses, recreation buses,

353
00:15:34,244 --> 00:15:36,370
and take them all down to vote.

354
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:39,214
(crowd chanting)

355
00:15:39,214 --> 00:15:40,307
- [Narrator] In 1982,

356
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:42,827
Barry was elected to a
second term as mayor,

357
00:15:42,827 --> 00:15:45,243
with 81% of the vote.

358
00:15:45,243 --> 00:15:48,405
- I want to thank all
of you for reaffirming

359
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:49,822
your faith in me.

360
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:52,415
(audience cheering)

361
00:15:52,415 --> 00:15:56,424
- It was clear that his
success in the election

362
00:15:56,424 --> 00:15:58,372
had been largely through black folks

363
00:15:58,372 --> 00:16:00,869
and not from the white community.

364
00:16:00,869 --> 00:16:02,393
He said get over it.

365
00:16:02,393 --> 00:16:04,976
(upbeat music)

366
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:06,918
- [Narrator] During his first term,

367
00:16:06,918 --> 00:16:10,121
Barry had honored promises
made to the gay community,

368
00:16:10,121 --> 00:16:13,671
a core constituency that
helped to elect him.

369
00:16:13,671 --> 00:16:16,337
- [Man] He understood that
we were a political power.

370
00:16:16,337 --> 00:16:19,120
- Just his willingness to say I will have

371
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,998
openly gay people in my administration.

372
00:16:21,998 --> 00:16:25,229
Nobody did that at that
time, so that was huge.

373
00:16:25,229 --> 00:16:27,928
(upbeat music)

374
00:16:27,928 --> 00:16:30,429
- [Narrator] Barry's actions
helped to establish D.C.

375
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:33,663
as one of the country's
most gay-friendly cities.

376
00:16:33,663 --> 00:16:35,695
- It affected most gay
people's social lives

377
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:37,795
in that they became more open.

378
00:16:37,795 --> 00:16:42,066
- [Woman] It gave the
community this enormous number

379
00:16:42,066 --> 00:16:45,399
of healthy, happy ways of meeting people

380
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:49,707
and so it made it a lot
easier for people to come out.

381
00:16:49,707 --> 00:16:53,671
("L'Amour" by Erasure)

382
00:16:53,671 --> 00:16:54,951
- [Narrator] By 1984,

383
00:16:54,951 --> 00:16:58,299
expansion of D.C.'s annual gay pride day

384
00:16:58,299 --> 00:17:00,915
to a week-long festival was complete,

385
00:17:00,915 --> 00:17:02,438
cementing Washington's status

386
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,580
as home to one of the country's largest

387
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:08,066
and most vibrant gay communities.

388
00:17:08,066 --> 00:17:11,233
(background cheering)

389
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:14,134
Improvement in the city's fortunes

390
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:16,275
also spread to the football field.

391
00:17:16,275 --> 00:17:19,198
("Thriller" by Michael Jackson)

392
00:17:19,198 --> 00:17:24,005
In 1981, team owner Jack Kent
Cooke fired coach Jack Pardee

393
00:17:24,005 --> 00:17:24,838
and replaced him

394
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:29,193
with San Diego offensive
coordinator, Joe Gibbs.

395
00:17:29,193 --> 00:17:31,692
- At first I said if I'm not successful

396
00:17:31,692 --> 00:17:33,393
hey, that's part of life,

397
00:17:33,393 --> 00:17:34,806
but when I got there what I realized

398
00:17:34,806 --> 00:17:37,261
is just how many people depend on you.

399
00:17:37,261 --> 00:17:40,056
- [Narrator] The team
began the season 0-5.

400
00:17:40,056 --> 00:17:41,274
- I thought I was gonna be first guy

401
00:17:41,274 --> 00:17:45,547
to ever coach in the NFL
and never win a game,

402
00:17:45,547 --> 00:17:47,099
tell Pat please sell the dog,

403
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,655
I'd hate to come home and see that fella

404
00:17:48,655 --> 00:17:51,637
draped over the steps. (laughing)

405
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:54,031
- [Narrator] But a third of
the way through the '81 season,

406
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:58,031
wins replaced losses, and
the team finished 8-8.

407
00:17:59,407 --> 00:18:01,980
- They had a really unique squad.

408
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,275
Theismann was just really slick.

409
00:18:05,275 --> 00:18:07,051
- Hit.
- Joe T. was probably

410
00:18:07,051 --> 00:18:10,327
one of the most passionate
football players,

411
00:18:10,327 --> 00:18:13,003
I mean that guy wanted to be successful.

412
00:18:13,003 --> 00:18:13,836
(crowd cheering)

413
00:18:13,836 --> 00:18:15,819
- [Man] Riggins was a bull.

414
00:18:15,819 --> 00:18:17,919
I mean you had Joe Washington

415
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,570
who was just this small, speedy guy.

416
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:24,669
Art Monk, anything you
threw up, he caught.

417
00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:26,319
- Their hearts were big and fat,

418
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:30,841
and they put a lot of
meat against that line.

419
00:18:30,841 --> 00:18:32,555
- [Crowd] We want Grant!

420
00:18:32,555 --> 00:18:34,212
We want Grant!

421
00:18:34,212 --> 00:18:35,713
We want Grant!

422
00:18:35,713 --> 00:18:36,858
- [Narrator] After going 8-1

423
00:18:36,858 --> 00:18:38,664
and first in the NFC East

424
00:18:38,664 --> 00:18:41,602
in the strike-shortened 1982 season,

425
00:18:41,602 --> 00:18:43,830
they hosted the NFC championship game

426
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:46,786
against their fiercest rival.

427
00:18:46,786 --> 00:18:49,894
- The excitement at RFK you
heard outside the stadium,

428
00:18:49,894 --> 00:18:51,479
just up in the neighborhood

429
00:18:51,479 --> 00:18:53,873
you'd just hear that roaring crowd.

430
00:18:53,873 --> 00:18:54,881
(crowd cheering)

431
00:18:54,881 --> 00:18:57,569
- [Narrator] The home
team was leading 24-17

432
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,901
with less than seven minutes remaining.

433
00:18:59,901 --> 00:19:01,601

Touchdown, Washington Redskins.

437
00:19:08,111 --> 00:19:09,234
Unbelievable!

438
00:19:09,234 --> 00:19:11,229
- [Man] The stadium was rocked.

439
00:19:11,229 --> 00:19:12,647
It was thunderous.

440
00:19:12,647 --> 00:19:14,117
- [Announcer] I do not believe it!

441
00:19:14,117 --> 00:19:15,903
(crowd roaring)

442
00:19:15,903 --> 00:19:18,348

the team headed to Pasadena

443
00:19:18,348 --> 00:19:22,008
to play the Miami Dolphins
in Superbowl XVII.

444

(football players chanting)

445
00:19:25,223 --> 00:19:27,292
The game was close throughout.

446
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:29,458
- It came down to the 4th quarter,

447
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,377
I think we were on the plus 41 yard line,

448
00:19:31,377 --> 00:19:36,377
and it was 4th and one, and
I made a call to go for it.

449
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,579
- [Announcer] There goes

Hand to Riggins.

452
00:19:40,998 --> 00:19:43,770
He's got a good hold, he's
got the first down for 40.

453
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:44,843
He's gone!

454
00:19:44,843 --> 00:19:47,676
The 35, the 30, the 20, he's gone!

455
00:19:48,612 --> 00:19:49,859
He's gone!

456
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:52,543
Touchdown, Washington Redskins.

It was euphoric.

464

The city's team finally
brought home the bacon.

And Henry Rollins, he was my best friend,

482
00:20:50,512 --> 00:20:51,345
we heard it on the radio

483
00:20:51,345 --> 00:20:54,850
and we just pulled the car
over to listen to the song.

- [Narrator] In addition to
Chuck Brown and Trouble Funk,

486
00:20:59,013 --> 00:21:01,606
bands such as Rare Essence and E.U.

487
00:21:01,606 --> 00:21:05,932
created a music and culture
proud of its D.C. roots.

488
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:08,334
- Look what I brought to y'all, all right?

489
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:11,044
- Go-go was a product of a time

490
00:21:11,044 --> 00:21:15,127
when D.C. public schools
had more music programs.

491
00:21:16,978 --> 00:21:21,197
- Kids couldn't afford to buy instruments

492
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:24,832
and so the kids would
check out their instruments

493
00:21:24,832 --> 00:21:26,452
and they'd go home to practice all right,

494
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:28,893
but with the local go-go band.

495
00:21:28,893 --> 00:21:31,592
- [Narrator] Live recordings,
better known as PA tapes,

496
00:21:31,592 --> 00:21:35,310
became a form of currency for go-go fans.

497
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:38,460
- We used to go to the go-gos
with our big boom boxes

498
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:42,198
and stand in front of the speakers.

499
00:21:42,198 --> 00:21:44,234
- It was and still is a big thing

500
00:21:44,234 --> 00:21:45,854
to get your name called out,

501
00:21:45,854 --> 00:21:47,038
especially if your name is

502
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:49,321
always heard on the PA tapes, you know.

503
00:21:49,321 --> 00:21:51,349
- Woo, that was a big feeling

504
00:21:51,349 --> 00:21:55,160
and so you wanted that
PA tape from this date.

505
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,660
(funky music)

506
00:22:01,597 --> 00:22:04,590
- [Narrator] The City's
insatiable appetite for live go-go

507
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:07,950
led to performances
springing up all over town.

508
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:10,482
(funky music)

509
00:22:10,482 --> 00:22:12,558
- Everybody represented
where they came from.

510
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:14,396
Junk Yard from Barry Farm,

511
00:22:14,396 --> 00:22:17,526
Pat Worth named himself after the area.

512
00:22:17,526 --> 00:22:22,334
- My first ever experience
playing live with a go-go band

513
00:22:22,334 --> 00:22:24,686
was in my friend's backyard

514
00:22:24,686 --> 00:22:27,628
and people would crowd
around and listen to us.

515
00:22:27,628 --> 00:22:29,568
- [Narrator] A compulsion
to play live music

516
00:22:29,568 --> 00:22:32,917
that lead to an unlikely
sharing of stages.

517
00:22:32,917 --> 00:22:36,078
- A lot of the regular
clubs like The Bayou

518
00:22:36,078 --> 00:22:39,824
and Desperados only booked big rock bands

519
00:22:39,824 --> 00:22:42,834
or big-named people, so
we would play anywhere

520
00:22:42,834 --> 00:22:45,480
and it would end up that
we would play together.

("Should I Stay or Should
I Go" by The Clash)

522
00:22:53,075 --> 00:22:54,568
- [Narrator] One of these crossover venues

523
00:22:54,568 --> 00:22:57,191
was at 930 F Street, Northwest.

524
00:22:57,191 --> 00:23:00,615
- Their slogan was a place and a time.

525
00:23:00,615 --> 00:23:01,864
- [Narrator] When original owners

526
00:23:01,864 --> 00:23:03,742
Dody DiSanto and Jon Bowers

527
00:23:03,742 --> 00:23:08,091
opened The 930 Club in 1980,
their choice of location

528
00:23:08,091 --> 00:23:11,932
in the heart of downtown
was unconventional.

529
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,801
- [Man] When the 930 was
there, there were peep shows

530
00:23:13,801 --> 00:23:17,551
and you know, liquor
stores and strip joints.

531
00:23:18,695 --> 00:23:21,458
People couldn't afford to
buy expensive real estate

532
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:25,490
so they had to do it in
the bad parts of town.

533
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:27,347
- [Narrator] The tiny odd-shaped space

534
00:23:27,347 --> 00:23:29,564
was an acquired taste.

535
00:23:29,564 --> 00:23:32,210
- There was really not
much room for the audience.

536
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,191
It was like you were in a lobby.

537
00:23:34,191 --> 00:23:39,191
We would have bands show up
who were appalled and ask--

♪ Should I stay or should I go ♪

539
00:23:41,817 --> 00:23:44,001
So where's the club?

540
00:23:44,001 --> 00:23:46,772
And some bands walked out.

541
00:23:46,772 --> 00:23:51,676
DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh
Prince, Will Smith, walked out,

542
00:23:51,676 --> 00:23:53,482
two sold-out shows.

543
00:23:53,482 --> 00:23:55,445
(rock music)

544
00:23:55,445 --> 00:23:57,289
Course when the band did go on,

545
00:23:57,289 --> 00:23:59,788
you were right in front of them.

546
00:23:59,788 --> 00:24:01,742
(rock music)

547
00:24:01,742 --> 00:24:05,094
There was no closer
experience to see a show

548
00:24:05,094 --> 00:24:07,110
than the old 930 club.

549
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,107
(rock music)

550
00:24:08,107 --> 00:24:09,628
- [Narrator] A unique venue
that became a favorite

551
00:24:09,628 --> 00:24:12,431
of the local hardcore punk scene,

552
00:24:12,431 --> 00:24:14,321
defined by its inclusion of anyone

553
00:24:14,321 --> 00:24:16,859
who didn't feel they belonged.

554
00:24:16,859 --> 00:24:17,726
- If you grew up in this town

555
00:24:17,726 --> 00:24:19,468
I think you feel really marginalized

556
00:24:19,468 --> 00:24:21,515
from one reason or another.

557
00:24:21,515 --> 00:24:23,362
- [Narrator] D.C. punk
gave birth to bands like

558
00:24:23,362 --> 00:24:25,558
Government Issue, State of Alert,

559
00:24:25,558 --> 00:24:29,380

It was a chip on our shoulder.

(punk rock singing)

566
00:24:45,455 --> 00:24:48,302
- Bad Brains were four guys
from Anacostia in PG County

567
00:24:48,302 --> 00:24:51,469
and they were just an incredible band.

helped to attract a
strong, loyal following.

00:28:14,142 --> 00:28:15,959
Truth be told, Reagan's a sensitive,

639
00:28:15,959 --> 00:28:18,834
I mean something like
that would affect him.

640
00:28:18,834 --> 00:28:19,991
- [Narrator] Two days later,

641
00:28:19,991 --> 00:28:22,404
President Ronald Reagan was reelected.

642
00:28:22,404 --> 00:28:24,083
- You ain't seen nothin' yet.

643
00:28:24,083 --> 00:28:27,318
(audience applauding)

644
00:28:27,318 --> 00:28:29,083
- I had several friends
that seemed to have

645
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:31,279
this continual flu bug,

646
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,671
and then it became pneumonia
and then they just died.

647
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:37,328
- [Narrator] As Reagan
began his second term,

648
00:28:37,328 --> 00:28:40,321
a lack of action towards
those suffering and dying

649
00:28:40,321 --> 00:28:42,631
from HIV infection persisted.

650
00:28:42,631 --> 00:28:43,628
- [Reporter] White House officials confirm

651
00:28:43,628 --> 00:28:45,098
that the president has never talked

652
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:48,668
with his surgeon general about AIDS.

653
00:28:48,668 --> 00:28:49,824
- [Narrator] Those in
the district turned to

654
00:28:49,824 --> 00:28:52,176
The Washington Blade for information.

655
00:28:52,176 --> 00:28:54,307
- The community desperately needed

656
00:28:54,307 --> 00:28:57,625
information about the disease.

657
00:28:57,625 --> 00:28:59,904
- [Narrator] On April 4th, 1983,

658
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,844
the Whitman-Walker Clinic held D.C.'s

659
00:29:01,844 --> 00:29:04,765
first public forum on the epidemic.

660
00:29:04,765 --> 00:29:08,018
- Whitman Walker was one
of the founding fathers

661
00:29:08,018 --> 00:29:09,685
of AIDS information.

662
00:29:11,558 --> 00:29:13,992
But they also helped house people,

663
00:29:13,992 --> 00:29:15,914
they helped to feed people.

664
00:29:15,914 --> 00:29:17,972
They had to actually step
in and become involved

665
00:29:17,972 --> 00:29:19,828
in the link between the doctors

666
00:29:19,828 --> 00:29:21,837
and the hospitals and the patients

667
00:29:21,837 --> 00:29:22,980
because a lot of people were being

668
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,180
turned away from hospitals.

of two public figures

672
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,630
with ties to Washington
forced the country,

673
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:39,373
and the president, to act.

674
00:29:39,373 --> 00:29:43,374
- Rock Hudson was familiar
with the president himself

675
00:29:43,374 --> 00:29:47,101
and an individual who had one, particular,

676
00:29:47,101 --> 00:29:50,934
very influential friend in Washington.

677
00:29:50,934 --> 00:29:52,939
Elizabeth Taylor.

678
00:29:52,939 --> 00:29:56,831
Not only was she an icon of the movies,

679
00:29:56,831 --> 00:30:01,328
she was also married to a
US senator from Virginia,

680
00:30:01,328 --> 00:30:02,913
John Warner.

681
00:30:02,913 --> 00:30:07,628
And so minds were changed and
the perception began to shift.

682
00:30:07,628 --> 00:30:12,628
- That science will continue
to find the critical answers.

683
00:30:13,287 --> 00:30:14,936
- Jerry Smith, my favorite tight end

684
00:30:14,936 --> 00:30:18,671
for the Washington Redskins,
then he was stricken with AIDS,

685
00:30:18,671 --> 00:30:22,338
it became apparent that
this He-Man was gay.

686
00:30:23,966 --> 00:30:26,013
- [Darian] Ronald Reagan's
opinion definitely changed

687
00:30:26,013 --> 00:30:27,851
because these were your friends dying.

00:30:27,851 --> 00:30:30,135
Same thing happened to me.

Jerry Smith's passing,

692
00:30:38,517 --> 00:30:41,991
an estimated half million
people descended on Washington

693
00:30:41,991 --> 00:30:46,401
with a second march for
gay and lesbian rights.

710
00:31:30,468 --> 00:31:32,013

- [Narrator] Attempts to give the district

714
00:31:42,146 --> 00:31:46,753
congressional representation
and statehood had gone nowhere.

715
00:31:46,753 --> 00:31:49,927
Many started to ask if
Barry's management of the city

716
00:31:49,927 --> 00:31:51,806
was part of the problem.

717
00:31:51,806 --> 00:31:54,104
- Marion Barry was
already starting to have

718
00:31:54,104 --> 00:31:58,184
some budget problems,
running some deficits,

719
00:31:58,184 --> 00:32:01,244
but he didn't cut his crony contracts,

720
00:32:01,244 --> 00:32:04,100
he didn't cut waste fraud and abuse,

721
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:07,267
what he cut was 1,500 police officers.

722
00:32:08,628 --> 00:32:13,125
- [Narrator] Mayor Barry's
lifestyle also raised questions.

723
00:32:13,125 --> 00:32:14,591
- [Reporter] Karen Johnson
just told authorities

724
00:32:14,591 --> 00:32:17,909
that she sold the mayor
cocaine, 20 to 30 times,

725
00:32:17,909 --> 00:32:20,650
from late 1980 to 1982.

726
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:24,983
- [Man] He was notorious
for staying out late

727
00:32:24,983 --> 00:32:27,083
with women who were not his wife.

728
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:29,932
This is when he would
use the security detail

729
00:32:29,932 --> 00:32:31,830
to procure women for him.

730
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,951
- Marion Barry tonight angrily denied

731
00:32:33,951 --> 00:32:37,752
that he has been hospitalized
after overdosing on cocaine.

732
00:32:37,752 --> 00:32:41,835
- Marion Barry became too
comfortable with power.

733
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:45,431
After winning over the
overwhelming majority

734
00:32:45,431 --> 00:32:47,708
of the African American population,

735
00:32:47,708 --> 00:32:50,875
he felt he could no longer be removed.

736
00:32:51,921 --> 00:32:52,929
- He was powerful,

737
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:56,351
he could make a lot of
things happen in your ward.

738
00:32:56,351 --> 00:32:58,755
Hey, do you want that new fire station?

739
00:32:58,755 --> 00:33:00,772
Do you want the library?

740
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:02,578
- [Narrator] Growing
discontent that led Barry

741
00:33:02,578 --> 00:33:07,103
to have real competition in
the '86 mayoral election.

742
00:33:07,103 --> 00:33:10,032
- In Washington D.C., where
the voter registration

743
00:33:10,032 --> 00:33:13,365
was 10 to one, Democrats to Republicans,

744
00:33:15,041 --> 00:33:17,208
I got a third of the vote.

745
00:33:18,381 --> 00:33:19,355
- [Narrator] Though Schwartz's tally

746
00:33:19,355 --> 00:33:21,268
exceeded everyone's expectations,

747
00:33:21,268 --> 00:33:23,914
Barry's base delivered him a third term,

748
00:33:23,914 --> 00:33:26,885
with 61% of the vote.

749
00:33:26,885 --> 00:33:29,898
- Washington Post endorsed
him three straight times,

750
00:33:29,898 --> 00:33:32,619
I think with growing reluctance
or something like that

751
00:33:32,619 --> 00:33:33,731
the third time.

752
00:33:33,731 --> 00:33:34,677
(background chattering)

753
00:33:34,677 --> 00:33:36,388
- [Narrator] But the
electorate and opinion pages

754
00:33:36,388 --> 00:33:38,947
cooling on Barry did nothing

755
00:33:38,947 --> 00:33:42,466
to slow his larger than life persona.

756
00:33:42,466 --> 00:33:46,319
- When people elected me,
they didn't elect me pope.

757
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:48,400
They elected me mayor.

758
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,234
I'd go out at night at nine
o'clock or ten o'clock,

759
00:33:51,234 --> 00:33:53,051
what did that have to do with anything?

♪ And the beat goes on ♪

761
00:33:55,182 --> 00:33:57,191
- Because of his short attention span

762
00:33:57,191 --> 00:34:02,191
and he could compartmentalize,
he would go out at night

763
00:34:02,315 --> 00:34:04,133
with the famous, "I'm a night owl,"

764
00:34:04,133 --> 00:34:06,182
as if that would wash things away.

765
00:34:06,182 --> 00:34:09,469
- [Narrator] The city paper
dubbed him Mayor For Life.

766
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:13,006
- When you're for the
people, the people know it.

767
00:34:13,006 --> 00:34:17,616
He's the only one I seen
that stood there for us.

768
00:34:17,616 --> 00:34:18,708
- [Narrator] If he hadn't been mayor,

769
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:21,615
Barry's nightlife would
not have been surprising

770
00:34:21,615 --> 00:34:26,108
as D.C.'s bar and club scene
reached a peak in the mid-80s.

771
00:34:26,108 --> 00:34:28,441
- There was this club called The Foxtrappe

772
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:32,232
and it was the place
to go for the buppies.

773
00:34:32,232 --> 00:34:34,887
- That was the quintessential place

774
00:34:34,887 --> 00:34:39,009
where high-income sophisticated people go.

775
00:34:39,009 --> 00:34:42,064
(upbeat music)

776
00:34:42,064 --> 00:34:44,469
- You dress up to go there,

777
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:45,981
you dressed up your behavior too

778
00:34:45,981 --> 00:34:49,478
and your manners,
(chuckling) in most cases.

779
00:34:49,478 --> 00:34:52,175
- [Narrator] Because the
Foxtrappe wasn't just a nightclub,

780
00:34:52,175 --> 00:34:54,098
it was a D.C. institution

781
00:34:54,098 --> 00:34:56,500
where members of the
black congressional caucus

782
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,516
rubbed shoulders with African
American business leaders

783
00:34:59,516 --> 00:35:00,826

789
00:35:12,603 --> 00:35:14,420
A lot of them were fundraisers.

790
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:17,444
A lot of them were what we
would call networking events,

791
00:35:17,444 --> 00:35:19,813
and it was very important for
young, black professionals

792
00:35:19,813 --> 00:35:22,460
to feel a sense of solidarity

793

00:35:25,317 --> 00:35:28,742
It was a great way to socialize
and also to meet new people.

00:42:43,181 --> 00:42:44,506
(upbeat rock music)

957
00:42:44,506 --> 00:42:46,954
- [Narrator] While cable
TV was in its infancy,

958
00:42:46,954 --> 00:42:51,300
Washington's local affiliates
were at their height.

959
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,507
- Hey, you want depth?

960
00:42:52,507 --> 00:42:54,641
Watch channel 26. (laughing)

961
00:42:54,641 --> 00:42:56,646
This is channel 4, we have fun here.

962
00:42:56,646 --> 00:42:59,292
♪ So good to turn to ♪

963
00:42:59,292 --> 00:43:00,300
- [Announcer] Channel 5,

964
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,377
Washington's most watched station.

965
00:43:02,377 --> 00:43:04,267
- [Broadcaster] From
WJLA TV, Washington's--

966
00:43:04,267 --> 00:43:05,538
- [Narrator] As ratings for local news

967
00:43:05,538 --> 00:43:07,986
created advertising dollars,

968
00:43:07,986 --> 00:43:09,570
battle between sports departments

969
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:11,903
became particularly fierce.

970
00:43:11,903 --> 00:43:14,874
- It turned into a golden
time of competition

971
00:43:14,874 --> 00:43:17,541
between channel 9 and channel 4.

972
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:20,952
George Michael had an open checkbook,

973
00:43:20,952 --> 00:43:23,544
George could cover anything he wanted.

974
00:43:23,544 --> 00:43:25,897
Glenn Brenner on the other hand,

975
00:43:25,897 --> 00:43:29,616
was probably the most talented, creative,

976
00:43:29,616 --> 00:43:32,921
hilarious character who ever
worked in television news.

977
00:43:32,921 --> 00:43:35,556
- How are you doing, I
mean, what's the chalk?

978
00:43:35,556 --> 00:43:36,897
- You got an over large--

979
00:43:36,897 --> 00:43:37,730
- Weenie?

980
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:38,644
- Weenie on the street, sir.

981
00:43:38,644 --> 00:43:40,014
- My weenie's too big?

982
00:43:40,014 --> 00:43:43,014
- George and Glenn hated each other.

983
00:43:45,227 --> 00:43:48,935
They would go to the
Superbowl, get the room number

984
00:43:48,935 --> 00:43:50,279
that the other guy was in

985
00:43:50,279 --> 00:43:54,972
and then walk into the bar and
say hey, drinks on the house!

986
00:43:54,972 --> 00:43:56,644
- [Narrator] Most residents also remember

987
00:43:56,644 --> 00:43:59,278
a favorite news station.

988
00:43:59,278 --> 00:44:01,860
- My favorite was Channel 4.

989
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:03,856
Jim Vance was just cool.

990
00:44:03,856 --> 00:44:05,422
He's just a smooth cat.

991
00:44:05,422 --> 00:44:07,677
He had a way of telling his stories

992
00:44:07,677 --> 00:44:09,916
without giving up the cool.

993
00:44:09,916 --> 00:44:11,458
- Channel 9 was held in a high regard

994
00:44:11,458 --> 00:44:13,493
as the number one news
station to a lot of people

995
00:44:13,493 --> 00:44:15,964
because they covered the news stories

996
00:44:15,964 --> 00:44:18,293
without opinions raised in them.

997
00:44:18,293 --> 00:44:20,970
(thrilling music)

998
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:23,398
- Starting with his third term,

999
00:44:23,398 --> 00:44:25,757
there seemed to be a deterioration

1000
00:44:25,757 --> 00:44:29,539
in the attention that Marion
Barry paid to the city.

1001
00:44:29,539 --> 00:44:31,536
- [Narrator] In January 1987,

1002
00:44:31,536 --> 00:44:36,042
the city was shut down
by a massive snowstorm.

1003
00:44:36,042 --> 00:44:37,820
- [Darian] Everything stopped.

1004
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:40,258
I had actually hosted a
large party the night before

1005
00:44:40,258 --> 00:44:45,172
and we came stumbling out the
door into six feet of snow.

1006
00:44:45,172 --> 00:44:46,179
- [Narrator] The day before,

1007
00:44:46,179 --> 00:44:50,265
Barry left town to attend
the Superbowl in California.

1008
00:44:50,265 --> 00:44:53,415
- It's no good, the guy,
he don't clean the street.

1009
00:44:53,415 --> 00:44:55,305
- [Narrator] While the
mayor was in California,

1010
00:44:55,305 --> 00:44:57,763
the region was hit with a bigger blizzard

1011
00:44:57,763 --> 00:44:59,912
but Barry stuck to his plans,

1012
00:44:59,912 --> 00:45:04,912
reportedly partying so hard
he was taken to the hospital.

1013
00:45:04,912 --> 00:45:07,569
Barry returned to D.C. the next day.

1014
00:45:07,569 --> 00:45:09,344
- It's unfortunate that so much snow fell,

1015
00:45:09,344 --> 00:45:11,475
which we certainly aren't responsible for.

1016
00:45:11,475 --> 00:45:12,808
(background chanting)

1017
00:45:12,808 --> 00:45:14,384
- [Narrator] Barry's lack of attention

1018
00:45:14,384 --> 00:45:16,358
was especially problematic,

1019
00:45:16,358 --> 00:45:20,136
as crack-related violence
threatened to overrun the city.

1020
00:45:20,136 --> 00:45:21,543
- The strange thing about it,

1021
00:45:21,543 --> 00:45:24,316
he never would tell you to do anything

1022
00:45:24,316 --> 00:45:27,056
except lock up the drug dealers.

1023
00:45:27,056 --> 00:45:28,518
- Outside of the killings,

1024
00:45:28,518 --> 00:45:32,212
one of the lowest crime
rates in the country.

1025
00:45:32,212 --> 00:45:33,045
- [Narrator] At the same time

1026
00:45:33,045 --> 00:45:35,809
the district's youth were
dragged into the epidemic,

1027
00:45:35,809 --> 00:45:39,160
the city cut funding for
recreational services,

1028
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:42,887
leaving go-gos one of the few
places to meet and gather.

1029
00:45:42,887 --> 00:45:47,188
- One element of go-go
is call and response.

1030
00:45:47,188 --> 00:45:50,476
It's very easy for a lead talker

1031
00:45:50,476 --> 00:45:54,643
to ask a crowd is Southeast
better than Northeast,

1032
00:45:56,893 --> 00:46:00,226
and so there's this automatic tribalism.

1033
00:46:01,714 --> 00:46:05,547
A few go-go bands would
sort of advertise PCP.

1034
00:46:08,367 --> 00:46:09,996
Tell me now, what y'all smoke?

1035
00:46:09,996 --> 00:46:12,444
And the people would respond Love Boat.

1036
00:46:12,444 --> 00:46:15,426
- And you get a whole bunch
of kids together just to dance

1037
00:46:15,426 --> 00:46:17,716
and all that and somebody pulls out a gun.

1038
00:46:17,716 --> 00:46:19,810
- [Narrator] Go-go's rise
to national prominence

1039
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:23,895
stalled as the music became
identified with violence.

1040
00:46:23,895 --> 00:46:26,773
- It was part of society.

1041
00:46:26,773 --> 00:46:29,751
Unfortunately, knuckleheads
like music too.

1042

♪ I'm feeling like a bum now ♪

1043
00:46:31,905 --> 00:46:33,868
- [Narrator] Under the
name The Go Go Posse,

1044
00:46:33,868 --> 00:46:36,819
a number of local bands recorded a single

1045
00:46:36,819 --> 00:46:38,611
promoting an end to the violence,

1046
00:46:38,611 --> 00:46:42,172
called D.C. Don't Stand for Dodge City.

00:46:50,248 --> 00:46:52,348
- Didn't change my life
because go-go music

1051
00:46:52,348 --> 00:46:55,478
oftentimes, it would
glorify all of the things

1052
00:46:55,478 --> 00:46:59,835
that this particular song
was speaking against.

1053
00:46:59,835 --> 00:47:01,767
- [Narrator] As the death toll mounted,

1054
00:47:01,767 --> 00:47:04,066
the city gained a dubious title.

1055
00:47:04,066 --> 00:47:05,281
- Washington is now called

1056
00:47:05,281 --> 00:47:07,384
the murder capital of the country.

1057
00:47:07,384 --> 00:47:08,359
(sirens wailing)

1058
00:47:08,359 --> 00:47:11,025
- My kids were in high school at the time

1059
00:47:11,025 --> 00:47:13,682
and they had on their wall

1060
00:47:13,682 --> 00:47:16,444
a list of the people who they knew,

1061
00:47:16,444 --> 00:47:21,412
either from their neighborhood
or their school who had died.

1062
00:47:21,412 --> 00:47:25,090
Before they graduated
from Dunbar High School,

1063
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:27,840
that list had grown to 25 people.

1064
00:47:31,863 --> 00:47:34,005
- [Narrator] While crack created squalor

1065
00:47:34,005 --> 00:47:37,060
in previously vibrant
residential neighborhoods,

1066
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:41,008
the city's commercial areas
were enjoying a relative boom.

1067
00:47:41,008 --> 00:47:42,675
- Downtown was dead.

1068
00:47:44,631 --> 00:47:48,338
And Barry said we gotta
do something about this.

1069
00:47:48,338 --> 00:47:50,471
Developers went to him
and said we want this,

1070
00:47:50,471 --> 00:47:55,143
we want that, and gave them
the land virtually free

1071
00:47:55,143 --> 00:47:57,718
and these projects were built.

1072
00:47:57,718 --> 00:47:59,515
- And we persuaded the banks and others

1073
00:47:59,515 --> 00:48:01,344
to lend money to these developers.

1074
00:48:01,344 --> 00:48:02,338
(upbeat music)

1075
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:03,171
- [Narrator] After some politicking,

1076
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:04,622
the Georgetown Waterfront

1077
00:48:04,622 --> 00:48:08,057
was one of the first
vistas to see results.

1078
00:48:08,057 --> 00:48:09,978
- Marion Barry recognized

1079
00:48:09,978 --> 00:48:14,839
that Washington Harbor could
be an enormous boom to the city

1080
00:48:14,839 --> 00:48:18,084
and so he was very instrumental.

1081
00:48:18,084 --> 00:48:19,890
- [Narrator] The success
of projects in Georgetown

1082
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:22,313
and downtown gave Barry the confidence

1083
00:48:22,313 --> 00:48:24,983
to try to redevelop less likely locations

1084
00:48:24,983 --> 00:48:28,867
including ground zero of the '68 riots.

1085
00:48:28,867 --> 00:48:30,348
- If you told someone you were going to 14

1086
00:48:30,348 --> 00:48:33,089
they knew you were going
to buy drugs, period.

1087
00:48:33,089 --> 00:48:35,357
- [Narrator] The Frank D.
Reeves Municipal Center,

1088
00:48:35,357 --> 00:48:38,095
named after the lawyer and
local civil rights leader,

1089
00:48:38,095 --> 00:48:39,345
opened in 1986.

1090
00:48:40,543 --> 00:48:43,438
- People who were going to
work in those offices every day

1091
00:48:43,438 --> 00:48:45,510
would need services,

1092
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:50,510
and even though at the time
it seemed fairly farfetched

1093
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:53,971
there was a certain sense
that it would restore

1094
00:48:53,971 --> 00:48:58,964
an element of validity to a
once flourishing neighborhood.

1095
00:48:58,964 --> 00:49:00,244
(upbeat music)

1096
00:49:00,244 --> 00:49:02,585
- [Narrator] Several
long-closed icons of the past

1097
00:49:02,585 --> 00:49:04,592
were also resurrected.

1098
00:49:04,592 --> 00:49:06,164
The Old Post Office,

1099
00:49:06,164 --> 00:49:10,280
a Romanesque Revival
structure dating to 1899,

1100
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:14,126
had been on the verge of
the wrecking ball for years.

1101
00:49:14,126 --> 00:49:15,815
- [Arthur] Sir David Wills,

1102
00:49:15,815 --> 00:49:19,365
who was heir to the
tobacco fortune in England,

1103
00:49:19,365 --> 00:49:23,416
cast a replica of the Westminster bells

1104
00:49:23,416 --> 00:49:26,819
as a bicentennial gift
to the United States.

1105
00:49:26,819 --> 00:49:28,605
He had this idea that they should hang

1106
00:49:28,605 --> 00:49:30,590
in the dome of the Capitol.

1107
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:34,191
- [Narrator] But the Capitol
wasn't built for that purpose.

1108
00:49:34,191 --> 00:49:36,709
- One bong of these great bells

1109
00:49:36,709 --> 00:49:40,637
and the Capitol dome would be
sitting down over the Mall.

1110
00:49:40,637 --> 00:49:43,800
The congress was so concerned about it

1111
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:47,682
that they appropriated
a new amount of money

1112
00:49:47,682 --> 00:49:51,906
and that was what finally
saved the entire building.

1113
00:49:51,906 --> 00:49:53,773
- All this was done with partnerships

1114
00:49:53,773 --> 00:49:57,282
and I think the results have been amazing.

1115
00:49:57,282 --> 00:49:59,088
- [Narrator] Saving Union Station,

1116
00:49:59,088 --> 00:50:01,039
a neglected Beaux-Art's masterpiece

1117
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:04,380
that had become the city's
unofficial homeless shelter

1118
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:07,939
became the responsibility of
a public private partnership.

1119
00:50:07,939 --> 00:50:09,725
- I thought it was very successful.

1120
00:50:09,725 --> 00:50:13,892
They were very careful in
preserving great spaces.

1121
00:50:14,854 --> 00:50:17,416
("Axel F" by Harold Faltermeyer)

1122
00:50:17,416 --> 00:50:21,145
(background chattering)
(dramatic music)

1123
00:50:21,145 --> 00:50:22,676
- [Narrator] D.C.'s downtown areas

1124
00:50:22,676 --> 00:50:24,703
received an additional boost

1125
00:50:24,703 --> 00:50:28,620
as a slew of local theaters
opened their doors.

1126
00:50:29,755 --> 00:50:32,328
- These little companies
started springing up

1127
00:50:32,328 --> 00:50:34,470
because downtown was so empty

1128
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:37,032
that they could get space cheap.

1129
00:50:37,032 --> 00:50:39,709
The Wooly Mammoth and the Studio theaters

1130
00:50:39,709 --> 00:50:43,797
opened on 14th Street,
14th Street sort of became

1131
00:50:43,797 --> 00:50:46,630
the center of alternative theater.

1132
00:50:47,955 --> 00:50:50,780
- [Narrator] But at first,
residents weren't convinced.

1133
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:55,000
- I would go over there to
watch some of their shows.

1134
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,167
10, 15, 20 people in the
audience plus the actors.

1135
00:51:00,835 --> 00:51:02,571
- [Narrator] But in
time, people's reluctance

1136
00:51:02,571 --> 00:51:04,660
to come downtown eased,

1137
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:06,267
and Washington began its rise

1138
00:51:06,267 --> 00:51:09,322
to America's second city of theater.

1139
00:51:09,322 --> 00:51:10,688
- Washington was like that.

1140
00:51:10,688 --> 00:51:15,688
I mean, it had certain kinds
of cultural niches if you will.

1141
00:51:17,996 --> 00:51:22,497
- I'm a Washingtonian and
the first theater I ever saw

1142
00:51:22,497 --> 00:51:25,914
was from the top balcony of the National.

1143
00:51:26,816 --> 00:51:28,562
- [Narrator] As Washington's
theater scene gained

1144
00:51:28,562 --> 00:51:30,206
countrywide attention,

1145
00:51:30,206 --> 00:51:32,317
it established an award named in honor

1146
00:51:32,317 --> 00:51:34,837
of one of the city's
most acclaimed daughters

1147
00:51:34,837 --> 00:51:38,647
to recognize local theatrical excellence.

1148
00:51:38,647 --> 00:51:42,484
- The great Washington
Post critic, Richard Coe

1149
00:51:42,484 --> 00:51:46,246
called on his friendship with Helen Hayes

1150
00:51:46,246 --> 00:51:49,370
and together they created
the Helen Hayes Awards

1151
00:51:49,370 --> 00:51:52,436
and once the Helen Hayes Awards started,

1152
00:51:52,436 --> 00:51:55,269
more companies started popping up.

1153
00:51:56,322 --> 00:51:58,736
By the end of the decade,
Washington was on the

1154
00:51:58,736 --> 00:52:01,236
same playing field as Chicago.

1155
00:52:03,367 --> 00:52:05,562
- [Narrator] The region's
growing interest in the arts

1156
00:52:05,562 --> 00:52:08,334
was exploited by
Washington's TV affiliates,

1157
00:52:08,334 --> 00:52:10,385
still hungry for novel programming.

1158
00:52:10,385 --> 00:52:11,855
- The critics really-- (drowned
out by orchestral music)

1159
00:52:11,855 --> 00:52:14,711
- The king of the critics
in Washington D.C.

1160
00:52:14,711 --> 00:52:17,156
was Davey Marlin-Jones.

1161
00:52:17,156 --> 00:52:18,864
Davey was one of the
most interesting people

1162
00:52:18,864 --> 00:52:20,124
I had ever met.

1163
00:52:20,124 --> 00:52:22,171
- There may be something there.

1164
00:52:22,171 --> 00:52:23,671
- Davey wore hats.

1165
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,516
He also pushed the
envelope with his clothes,

1166
00:52:27,516 --> 00:52:29,563
he pushed his envelope in every way.

1167
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:30,643
- Tight.

1168
00:52:30,643 --> 00:52:31,609
Taut.

1169
00:52:31,609 --> 00:52:32,671
Tense.

1170
00:52:32,671 --> 00:52:34,423
- Davey owned this town.

1171
00:52:34,423 --> 00:52:37,806
- Inside the theater called life.

1172
00:52:37,806 --> 00:52:40,849
- [Narrator] A popular format
that encouraged imitation.

1173
00:52:40,849 --> 00:52:43,199
- Every station in town had a critic

1174
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:46,550
and it was because we were all
trying to compete with Davey.

1175
00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:50,341
It was one of the great
gags of local television.

1176
00:52:50,341 --> 00:52:52,177
When he finished his report,

1177
00:52:52,177 --> 00:52:55,412
you didn't know if he liked
the movie or not. (chuckling)

1178
00:52:55,412 --> 00:52:59,822
- Hope you find one cinematic
sparkler among them.

1179
00:52:59,822 --> 00:53:01,849
Davey Marlin-Jones.

1180
00:53:01,849 --> 00:53:04,232
- I tried to make myself
different from Davey

1181
00:53:04,232 --> 00:53:07,308
so I used a ratings system.

1182
00:53:07,308 --> 00:53:10,362
On my scale of one to four stars,

1183
00:53:10,362 --> 00:53:12,571
Raiders of the Lost Ark gets a five.

1184
00:53:12,571 --> 00:53:14,259
So at least when I was finished

1185
00:53:14,259 --> 00:53:16,916
you would know what I
thought of the movie or not.

1186
00:53:16,916 --> 00:53:19,555
(upbeat music)
(crowd cheering)

1187
00:53:19,555 --> 00:53:22,411
- [Narrator] In 1986,
Washington's football team

1188
00:53:22,411 --> 00:53:25,252
picked up journeyman
quarterback Doug Williams

1189
00:53:25,252 --> 00:53:27,976
to back up its young
phenom, Jay Schroeder.

1190
00:53:27,976 --> 00:53:29,604
("Walk This Way" by RUN-DMC)

1191
00:53:29,604 --> 00:53:30,759
During the following season,

1192
00:53:30,759 --> 00:53:32,334
William shared quarterback duties

1193
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:34,016
with the oft-injured Schroeder.

1194
00:53:34,016 --> 00:53:35,107
(players shouting)

1195
00:53:35,107 --> 00:53:37,418
But once the team made it to the playoffs,

1196
00:53:37,418 --> 00:53:41,974
Williams' performance put
an end to any controversy.

1197
00:53:41,974 --> 00:53:46,974
- We had to go to Chicago
playing 13 below temperatures.

1198
00:53:47,368 --> 00:53:48,739
We won.

1199
00:53:48,739 --> 00:53:52,489
("Walk This Way" by RUN-DMC)

1200
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:56,323
The championship game against
the Minnesota Vikings,

1201
00:53:56,323 --> 00:53:58,274
I came off the bench and we won the game

1202
00:53:58,274 --> 00:54:00,688
and at coach's press conference,

1203
00:54:00,688 --> 00:54:03,767
he mentioned that I was gonna
be the starting quarterback,

1204
00:54:03,767 --> 00:54:06,225
me being the first African American

1205
00:54:06,225 --> 00:54:07,738
to play in the Superbowl.

1206
00:54:07,738 --> 00:54:09,196
I really cherished that time,

1207
00:54:09,196 --> 00:54:11,706
and for two weeks leading up to that game

1208
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:13,789
it was pretty much crazy.

1209
00:54:15,203 --> 00:54:17,330
- [Narrator] The game started out badly.

1210
00:54:17,330 --> 00:54:19,534
- [Announcer] Touchdown, Denver, 56--

1211
00:54:19,534 --> 00:54:20,626
- The score was 10 to nothing

1212
00:54:20,626 --> 00:54:23,515
against the Redskins in the first quarter.

1213
00:54:23,515 --> 00:54:25,624
- [Narrator] And then, it got worse.

1214
00:54:25,624 --> 00:54:27,052
- I hyper-extended my knee,

1215
00:54:27,052 --> 00:54:29,205
didn't know it at that particular time

1216
00:54:29,205 --> 00:54:30,486
whether or not I was gonna be able

1217
00:54:30,486 --> 00:54:32,355
to finish the football game.

1218
00:54:32,355 --> 00:54:35,210
- I was gonna substitute
for him, he said hey,

1219
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:38,862
get back out, I want
this, it's is my team.

1220
00:54:38,862 --> 00:54:39,700
(rock music)
- Touchdown!

1221
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:42,052
- [Narrator] In a historic
reversal of fortune,

1222
00:54:42,052 --> 00:54:45,569
the team scored five touchdowns
in the second quarter.

1223
00:54:45,569 --> 00:54:46,482
- [Announcer] Touchdown!

1224
00:54:46,482 --> 00:54:48,550
Washington takes the lead!

1225
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:50,052
- Everything we called worked.

1226
00:54:50,052 --> 00:54:52,908
- [Announcer] He's got Sanders
in the clear at the ten.

1227
00:54:52,908 --> 00:54:53,810
Touchdown!

1228
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:55,176
Touchdown, Washington Redskins.

1229
00:54:55,176 --> 00:54:56,122
(crowd roaring)

1230
00:54:56,122 --> 00:54:58,372
And a new Superbowl record.

1231
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:01,518
- I remember him holding
that helmet up, (laughing)

1232
00:55:01,518 --> 00:55:05,224
when he scored 35 points
in the second quarter.

1233
00:55:05,224 --> 00:55:09,047
One of the greatest quarter of
a game in Superbowl history.

1234
00:55:09,047 --> 00:55:12,869
- [Announcer] Doug Williams,
the MVP of Superbowl XXII.

1235
00:55:12,869 --> 00:55:15,190
- [Narrator] Williams was
the first black quarterback

1236
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:17,259
to start or win a Superbowl

1237
00:55:17,259 --> 00:55:20,513
and was crowned the game's
most valuable player.

1238
00:55:20,513 --> 00:55:23,033
- It was one of those
times that I raised my hat

1239
00:55:23,033 --> 00:55:25,217
and thinking to myself, you know,

1240
00:55:25,217 --> 00:55:27,768
I'd really like to tell
some people where to go

1241
00:55:27,768 --> 00:55:29,806
but it wasn't in my nature to do it.

1242
00:55:29,806 --> 00:55:33,849
(upbeat music)
(crowd cheering)

1243
00:55:33,849 --> 00:55:35,454
- [Narrator] As the '80s drew to a close,

1244
00:55:35,454 --> 00:55:39,370
Barry's lifestyle continued
to make headlines.

1245
00:55:39,370 --> 00:55:42,120
- At no time did I see any drugs,

1246
00:55:43,285 --> 00:55:47,382
use any drugs, or have any
knowledge of any drugs.

1247
00:55:47,382 --> 00:55:50,632
That little white powder is so powerful

1248
00:55:52,926 --> 00:55:56,118
it causes you to do things you
never thought you would do.

1249
00:55:56,118 --> 00:55:59,805
- [Narrator] The FBI uncovered
more allegations of drug use

1250
00:55:59,805 --> 00:56:03,028
and rampant corruption
among Barry's staff,

1251
00:56:03,028 --> 00:56:06,209
and that included deputy
mayor Ivanhoe Donaldson.

1252
00:56:06,209 --> 00:56:09,626
- I have been tried, convicted, sentenced

1253
00:56:11,134 --> 00:56:14,987
and doing time by some
members of the media.

1254
00:56:14,987 --> 00:56:16,185
- [Woman] I think Marion was very good

1255
00:56:16,185 --> 00:56:18,033
about playing the victim.

1256
00:56:18,033 --> 00:56:22,032
- Somebody set him up, (laughs)
somebody was picking on him.

1257
00:56:22,032 --> 00:56:24,353
- He didn't have the discipline

1258
00:56:24,353 --> 00:56:27,114
to stick to virtually anything.

1259
00:56:27,114 --> 00:56:28,426
I've heard more from Barry about

1260
00:56:28,426 --> 00:56:31,882
how he's gonna behave better
than I have from my own son.

1261
00:56:31,882 --> 00:56:35,085
- [Narrator] Despite it all,
Barry retained a grip on power,

1262
00:56:35,085 --> 00:56:37,572
kept afloat by his populist appeal.

1263
00:56:37,572 --> 00:56:40,786
- I think that some
black folks in the city

1264
00:56:40,786 --> 00:56:42,734
really thought that people
were going after Marion

1265
00:56:42,734 --> 00:56:44,582
because he was black,

1266
00:56:44,582 --> 00:56:47,509
and I don't think that
was necessarily the case.

1267
00:56:47,509 --> 00:56:50,294
- I'm a very controversial
person because I speak out.

1268
00:56:50,294 --> 00:56:53,296
But on the other hand, I'm
loved by a lot of people.

1269
00:56:53,296 --> 00:56:54,355
In fact people say

1270
00:56:54,355 --> 00:56:56,920
dang Barry, you're the
best mayor we ever had.

1271
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:59,659
They're telling the truth, too. (laughing)

1272
00:56:59,659 --> 00:57:03,282
- [Narrator] Marion Barry
dominated Washington in the '80s.

1273
00:57:03,282 --> 00:57:07,439
- He was the sun around
which we all orbited.

1274
00:57:07,439 --> 00:57:09,960
The good things, the bad things.

1275
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,293
- [Narrator] But even though the city

1276
00:57:11,293 --> 00:57:13,519
and the mayor's early
promise were now lost

1277
00:57:13,519 --> 00:57:16,176
among dysfunction and decay,

1278
00:57:16,176 --> 00:57:18,886
residents departed the
'80s with good memories

1279
00:57:18,886 --> 00:57:20,995
and optimism for the future.

1280
00:57:20,995 --> 00:57:24,450

an hour up Mass Avenue

1281
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:27,841
and nobody would blink an eye over it.

1282
00:57:27,841 --> 00:57:30,087
- My kids who grew up
in the middle of that
