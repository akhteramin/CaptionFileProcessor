1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
- It got infected, so they
had to remove the bone,

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,740
like the skull.

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,036
- Francesca?
- Yes.

4
00:00:06,036 --> 00:00:08,220
(funky upbeat music)

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,712
- If I follow normal protocol on this,

6
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:14,593
you'll end up with no car.

7
00:00:15,866 --> 00:00:19,021
- [Announcer] This is the
courtroom of Judge Frank Caprio,

8
00:00:19,021 --> 00:00:22,100
where people and cases
are met with compassion,

9
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,200
a different kind of judge,

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,240
a courtroom like no other,

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,193
this is Caught in Providence.

12
00:00:29,836 --> 00:00:31,233
- Who's Mr. Holder?

13
00:00:32,134 --> 00:00:34,140
- This is Mr. Holder, Your Honor.

14
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,180
- And are you here with him?

15
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,310
- Yes, I'm his counselor
at the Riverwood program.

16
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,600
- Okay, who's gonna do the speaking?

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,856
- I am at Mr. Holder's request.

18
00:00:42,856 --> 00:00:45,230
- [Frank] Alright, what do
you wanna tell me about this?

19
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,590
- Basically he received the
ticket on Sunday morning,

20
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,190
it started all his first park--

21
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,023
- Saturday.
- I'm sorry?

22
00:00:51,023 --> 00:00:52,170
- Saturday.
- Saturday morning, I'm sorry,

23
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,750
it's not at all his first ticket.

24
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,811
- He's had 31 tickets.

25
00:00:55,811 --> 00:00:58,500
- Obviously I'm his counselor
for significant reasons,

26
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,609
at the same time it's something

27
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:02,410
that we're working on
engagingly with Mr. Holder

28
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,450
and truthfully speaking,

29
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:06,328
the tickets are becoming
further and further apart.

30
00:01:06,328 --> 00:01:09,531
He happened to have been parked
across from Parenside Park

31
00:01:09,531 --> 00:01:11,760
in front of the old
Bank of America building

32
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,619
on this particular morning,

33
00:01:12,619 --> 00:01:13,937
he was attending a church service.

34
00:01:13,937 --> 00:01:16,306
Sometimes he goes there also
to meet up with his daughter,

35
00:01:16,306 --> 00:01:18,683
who's currently in a homeless situation.

36
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,957
So we are hoping that Your
Honor could find a reason

37
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:24,830
hopefully to waive this and
know that we're working actively

38
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,392
in terms of keeping this from happening.

39
00:01:26,392 --> 00:01:27,750
- Is he homeless now?

40
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,110
- Currently speaking he
lives with his father

41
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,100
at an assisted living
residence in East providence,

42
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,401
but actually we have an
appointment next week

43
00:01:34,401 --> 00:01:36,627
with the Gateway group to
hopefully line up housing,

44
00:01:36,627 --> 00:01:39,244
affordable housing in North Providence.

45
00:01:39,244 --> 00:01:41,840
- Tell me about the program,

46
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,186
I don't know what the program is about.

47
00:01:44,186 --> 00:01:45,838
- We're a social services agency,

48
00:01:45,838 --> 00:01:48,530
we're under the Horizon
Group, we have two locations,

49
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,344
one in Providence, one
in Warren, Rhode Island,

50
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:51,957
you know, in the East Bay area.

51
00:01:51,957 --> 00:01:52,826
From there on out,

52
00:01:52,826 --> 00:01:55,200
Mr. Holder's been a
longtime client of ours

53
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,613
and I've been working as his counselor

54
00:01:56,613 --> 00:01:57,888
throughout the last nine months.

55
00:01:57,888 --> 00:01:59,144
- What's the name of the program?

56
00:01:59,144 --> 00:02:00,987
- Riverwood, one word.
- Are you familiar with that?

57
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:03,793
- [Ziggy] No, but I am
familiar with Horizon,

58
00:02:03,793 --> 00:02:05,340
I have heard of that.

59
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,680
- It's basically human
services and social work,

60
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,510
primarily the role of
the Providence program

61
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:13,653
is to provide affordable housing
for low income individuals.

62
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,673
- Based on your representations,
I'm gonna dismiss it.

63
00:02:18,673 --> 00:02:19,673
- Thank you.

64
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,370
- But I want Mr. Holder to know

65
00:02:24,738 --> 00:02:27,300
that this doesn't give you
a license in the future

66
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,070
to say it's okay, I'll
bring my counselor down,

67
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,160
I can get away with it, okay,

68
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,294
I'm doing this based
on his representation.

69
00:02:33,294 --> 00:02:35,894
Do you understand that?

70
00:02:35,894 --> 00:02:38,000
You explain it to him, when he gets out,

71
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,815
'cause he's homeless, okay, alright.

72
00:02:39,815 --> 00:02:41,614
- It's our intention to
avoid it, if at all possible,

73
00:02:41,614 --> 00:02:43,164
thank you, Your Honor.
- Okay.

74
00:02:52,842 --> 00:02:57,287
I'm just trying to see
if he gives me attitude.

75
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:05,750
- Despite what you may be thinking,

76
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,740
I believe this motorist

77
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,400
actually made two wise
choices in court today,

78
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,050
the first, having his
social worker speak for him.

79
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,510
Can you imagine what would have happened,

80
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,100
if he had opened his mouth?

81
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,390
I think he'd still be
enjoying the hospitality

82
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:20,060
of one of our local
correctional institutions.

83
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,610
The second is that he waited

84
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,620
until he passed Inspector Kerrigan,

85
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,620
before he disrespected the judge.

86
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,047
Trust me, that may have been
the wisest move of his life.

87
00:03:30,047 --> 00:03:32,055
- [Frank] Anthony Michael Giacobi,

88
00:03:32,055 --> 00:03:33,613
good morning, Mr. Giacobi.
- Morning, sir.

89
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:35,739
- What do your friends call
you, they call you Tony,

90
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:37,743
they call you AM, what do they call you?

91
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,420
- I can't say what they call me.

92
00:03:44,118 --> 00:03:45,973
- I expected that kind of an answer.

93
00:03:48,917 --> 00:03:51,490
Where are you from, Nevada?

94
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:52,323
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah?

95
00:03:52,323 --> 00:03:53,842
What are you doing in Rhode Island?

96
00:03:53,842 --> 00:03:55,090
- What am I doing?

97
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,970
I moved back here stupidly.

98
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:57,859
(court laughing)

99
00:03:57,859 --> 00:04:00,280
- Are you calling me stupid?

100
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,798
- I was thinking about it, but I--

101
00:04:01,798 --> 00:04:04,548
(court laughing)

102
00:04:05,452 --> 00:04:08,230
- Listen, I'm gonna tell you something,

103
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,940
that's not nice.

104
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,250
Mr. Giacobi, you're charged
with going through a red light

105
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,222
on Allens Avenue and Terminal Street,

106
00:04:14,222 --> 00:04:15,480
are we watching these today?

107
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,313
We should watch it.
- Yes,

108
00:04:16,313 --> 00:04:17,260
we need to see it, judge.
- Alright,

109
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,452
here's what we're gonna do, Mr.
Giacobi, I'm gonna watch it.

110
00:04:19,452 --> 00:04:22,895
Now there are two lines on Allens Avenue,

111
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:24,560
there are two stop lines,

112
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,206
if you are passed the first stop line,

113
00:04:27,206 --> 00:04:29,816
when the light turns red, I'll dismiss it,

114
00:04:29,816 --> 00:04:32,103
if you're not passed it,
it's gonna cost you 85 bucks,

115
00:04:32,103 --> 00:04:34,621
we're gonna take a look
at it, look up here.

116
00:04:34,621 --> 00:04:38,062
- [Ziggy] It's already red,
judge, show the time link,

117
00:04:38,062 --> 00:04:41,200
it was red for 16.2 seconds, judge.

118
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,393
- If I look at this,

119
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,340
I look at this every day

120
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:49,320
and I'm supposed to know
that when the light clicks

121
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,560
three times, that it's red,

122
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,288
I'm supposed to know that,

123
00:04:53,288 --> 00:04:55,070
I think we're all supposed to know that.

124
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,110
So they send me this kind of a video,

125
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,235
in a court of law, I can't
tell what color the light is,

126
00:04:59,235 --> 00:05:01,500
I know it changed three
times, Inspector Quinn,

127
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,436
but it went from white to white to white.

128
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:05,720
- No, it didn't change at all, judge.

129
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,710
It stayed red according to the notice,

130
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,640
but according to the video,
I agree with you, judge,

131
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,329
I couldn't determine as to whether--

132
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:15,623
- No, I am not convinced by
clear and convincing evidence,

133
00:05:15,623 --> 00:05:17,719
they didn't present clear and
convincing evidence to me,

134
00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:20,570
that the light was red, I
never saw red on the screen,

135
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,769
I saw it all white.

136
00:05:21,769 --> 00:05:24,110
I know it changed three
times, but I don't know

137
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:27,221
if when it changed three
times, what color it was.

138
00:05:27,221 --> 00:05:29,229
That's a very long story,

139
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:31,170
but the result is that I'm
gonna dismiss the case,

140
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,633
because the city has failed to prove

141
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,232
by clear and convincing evidence

142
00:05:35,232 --> 00:05:36,310
that you went through a red light.

143
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,657
Now is there anything you wanna say?

144
00:05:38,657 --> 00:05:39,940
- Thank you.

145
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,773
- Oh.

146
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:42,480
(court laughing)

147
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,085
He's never told me what
your friends call you.

148
00:05:45,085 --> 00:05:46,590
What do your friends call
you, they call you Tony,

149
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:49,453
they call you Anthony,
what do they call you?

150
00:05:49,453 --> 00:05:50,296
(bleep)

151
00:05:50,296 --> 00:05:53,273
(court laughing)

152
00:05:53,273 --> 00:05:54,693
- His middle name.

153
00:05:57,239 --> 00:05:58,593
- Thank you, sir.

154
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,860
- Well, I guess we had it coming,

155
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,197
the judge did ask him three times

156
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:05,340
what his friends called him,

157
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,180
based on his response,
we know he wasn't lying,

158
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,380
he really is an (bleep).

159
00:06:11,298 --> 00:06:13,233
- [Frank] Josev Parentos.

160
00:06:15,546 --> 00:06:17,030
- Good morning, Your Honor.
- You've a parking ticket

161
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,593
on Thayer Street, sir?
- Yes.

162
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,310
That day I wasn't driving the car,

163
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:24,121
I was just getting out the hospital,

164
00:06:24,121 --> 00:06:26,260
'cause I had brain surgery

165
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:30,160
and my son literally
parked at the corner of CVS

166
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,647
and I got in the car and the lady said,

167
00:06:32,647 --> 00:06:34,950
"You can't park there,
it's a fire hydrant,"

168
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:35,783
and I said, oh, alright, I understand,

169
00:06:35,783 --> 00:06:37,860
I've had brain surgery, I had my helmet on

170
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,370
and then she says, "Yeah, sure,"

171
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,080
she didn't really believe me.

172
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,900
I got in the car and then we left

173
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,760
and then I got in the mail, the ticket,

174
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,759
she didn't even give us a ticket

175
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:48,460
on the way she was or anything.

176
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,770
- Alright, case is dismissed.

177
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:50,843
- I appreciate it, Your Honor, thank you.

178
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:51,676
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

179
00:06:51,676 --> 00:06:53,616
- How are you feeling?
- Good.

180
00:06:53,616 --> 00:06:55,565
- I can't hear you, speak into the mic.

181
00:06:55,565 --> 00:06:56,398
- Alright.

182
00:06:56,398 --> 00:06:59,785
I had brain cancer surgery
and then it got infected,

183
00:06:59,785 --> 00:07:02,816
so they had to remove the bone,
like the skull of my head.

184
00:07:02,816 --> 00:07:04,120
- The skull?
- Yeah.

185
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,953
- So that's why you're wearing a helmet?

186
00:07:04,953 --> 00:07:06,020
- It's why I'm wearing a helmet, yes.

187
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,080
- Yeah.
- So hopefully

188
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,546
in October I'm good.

189
00:07:08,546 --> 00:07:10,376
- Okay, we're rooting for you, good luck.

190
00:07:10,376 --> 00:07:12,542
- [Josev] I appreciate it, thank you.

191
00:07:12,542 --> 00:07:13,764
- I got divorced from him

192
00:07:13,764 --> 00:07:15,805
maybe about six or seven years ago,

193
00:07:15,805 --> 00:07:16,860
- [Frank] Yeah.

194
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,488
- right before he went to
federal prison for 15 years.

195
00:07:19,488 --> 00:07:21,378
- You're telling me all
these bad things about him,

196
00:07:21,378 --> 00:07:23,992
but when he comes in,
you let him use the car?

197
00:07:23,992 --> 00:07:26,626

202
00:07:35,864 --> 00:07:38,032

(coughing)

207
00:07:46,173 --> 00:07:48,021
- It's just a cough.
- Yeah, right

208
00:07:48,021 --> 00:07:49,219
and the Earth is flat.

209
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:50,926

- We're doing karaoke later
and you're gonna sing.

216
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,052
- Jamie, this is your house?

217
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:06,959
- I know, it's not much, but it's home,

218
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,009
right kids?
- Kids?

219
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:09,767
- Papa, Papa!
- Oh!

220
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:11,479
- You didn't tell me
your friends were coming.

221
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:12,345
- [Jamie] Oh, yeah.

222
00:08:12,345 --> 00:08:14,071
- This one is tiny like a child.

223
00:08:14,071 --> 00:08:15,352
- Yeah, she is.
(laughing)

224
00:08:15,352 --> 00:08:16,272
Ah, but seriously,

225
00:08:16,272 --> 00:08:18,537
it's good to be surrounded
by what matters most,

226
00:08:18,537 --> 00:08:20,757
a Home and Auto Bundle from Progressive.

227
00:08:20,757 --> 00:08:22,589
- Oh, sweetie, please, play for us.

228
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:24,015
- Oh, no, I couldn't.

229
00:08:24,015 --> 00:08:25,348
- Please.
- Okay.

230
00:08:26,409 --> 00:08:30,031
(singing in Italian)

231
00:08:30,031 --> 00:08:33,418
(funky upbeat music)

232
00:08:33,418 --> 00:08:34,958
- Now this is a beautiful car,

233
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,524
how much do I have to put down?

234
00:08:36,524 --> 00:08:37,869
- To you, three grand.

235
00:08:37,869 --> 00:08:40,536
- Not if you call 800-Next Auto.

236
00:08:41,403 --> 00:08:42,553
Book 'em, boys!
- Huh?

237
00:08:42,553 --> 00:08:44,360
(melodramatic music)

238
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,144
- It's a crime to pay more than a dime.

239
00:08:46,144 --> 00:08:47,321
- One dime down.

240
00:08:47,321 --> 00:08:48,354
- At AutoGiants,

241
00:08:48,354 --> 00:08:51,388

250
00:09:07,778 --> 00:09:10,613

259
00:09:25,692 --> 00:09:27,206
- At AutoGiants three locations,

260
00:09:27,206 --> 00:09:29,109
but you have to call to get this offer.

261
00:09:29,109 --> 00:09:30,154

262
00:09:30,154 --> 00:09:31,487
- 800-Next Auto.

263
00:09:33,629 --> 00:09:35,546
- [Frank] Kathy Acosta.

264
00:09:36,965 --> 00:09:39,416
Kathy, you have two red light violations.

265
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:42,916
- Yeah, it wasn't me driving.
- Who drives?

266
00:09:43,815 --> 00:09:47,916
- It was my ex-husband,
he lives in Puerto Rico

267
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:52,083
and the first one that he
got, he said he paid it,

268
00:09:53,805 --> 00:09:56,638
now I get a second one in the mail

269
00:09:57,725 --> 00:09:59,058
and I'm furious.

270
00:10:01,151 --> 00:10:02,830
- Are you divorced from this guy?

271
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:03,663
- Yes, I am.

272
00:10:03,663 --> 00:10:06,578
- [Frank] When did you get divorced?

273
00:10:06,578 --> 00:10:07,528
- Well,

274
00:10:07,528 --> 00:10:09,198
well.
(court laughing)

275
00:10:09,198 --> 00:10:12,308
- A year ago, two years
ago, six months ago, when?

276
00:10:12,308 --> 00:10:13,732
- Oh, I got divorced from him

277
00:10:13,732 --> 00:10:15,841
maybe about six or seven years ago.

278
00:10:15,841 --> 00:10:16,825
- [Frank] Yeah.

279
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:21,325
- right before he went to
federal prison for 15 years,

280
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,770
just to explain what a good citizen he is.

281
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:26,218
- Well, the fact of the matter is

282
00:10:26,218 --> 00:10:28,480
that the ticket was
just issued last month.

283
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,455
- Yeah, he just left last month.

284
00:10:30,455 --> 00:10:32,372
- Oh, he's your ex-husband, but he keeps,

285
00:10:32,372 --> 00:10:34,880
he's your ex-husband, but you
still let him use your car?

286
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,934
- Well, I try to be fair.
- You're telling me

287
00:10:35,934 --> 00:10:37,480
all these bad things about him,

288
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,040
but when he comes in,
you let him use the car?

289
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,763
- True, true,

290
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:44,530
that's against me for being foolish.

291
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:45,790
- No, no, it's not against you,

292
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,623
I'm just trying to figure something out.

293
00:10:46,623 --> 00:10:48,611
- It's because we have a child together.

294
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,363
She's grown now, but.

295
00:10:52,663 --> 00:10:54,143
- Let's take a look at it.

296
00:10:55,803 --> 00:10:57,898
There he goes right through
the light, he don't care.

297
00:10:57,898 --> 00:10:59,298
Let's look at the other one.

298
00:11:00,439 --> 00:11:02,318
(speaking too far from mic)

299
00:11:02,318 --> 00:11:04,868
Yeah, that was a close one,
alright, lights please.

300
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,647
Kathy, I think you suffer
from having a big heart,

301
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,640
I think you're just too kind.

302
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,703
- Suffered for a long time.
- Yeah.

303
00:11:12,703 --> 00:11:14,193
- I've paid my dues.

304
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,168
- Yeah, I'm gonna dismiss one of these,

305
00:11:17,168 --> 00:11:19,140
because you're paying.
- Yeah,

306
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:23,403
but what I wanted to do was
to have him pay both of them,

307
00:11:23,403 --> 00:11:25,843
but on his license in Puerto Rico.

308
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,230
- Kathy, when you receive these summons,

309
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,890
on the back of the summons,

310
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:35,497
if you had told us who
was driving the car,

311
00:11:35,497 --> 00:11:37,125
then he would be held responsible,

312
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:41,183
you didn't do that and the
time for that has passed.

313
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,369
So it's too late to do that.

314
00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:46,660
I would love to help you, if
I could do it, I would do it,

315
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,757
but it has no effect, if
you had done it originally,

316
00:11:49,757 --> 00:11:51,856
then we would have notified
the authorities there

317
00:11:51,856 --> 00:11:53,483
and he would have had a problem.

318
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:55,720
Okay.

319
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,743
- Lesson learned.

320
00:11:57,794 --> 00:11:59,385
- Good luck to you.

321
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,468
(funky upbeat music)

322
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,134
Jennifer Cruz.

323
00:12:07,134 --> 00:12:08,600
Jennifer, get close to the mic.

324
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,070
- Good morning, Your Honor.

325
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,370
- [Frank] What is your daughter's name?

326
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,660
- Marlenny.
- What is it?

327
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,110
- Marlenny.

328
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,763
- She's very well behaved.
- Thank you.

329
00:12:16,763 --> 00:12:17,700
- How old are you, honey?

330
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,450
- I'm five years old.
- Five?

331
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,868
You wanna come up here?

332
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:24,403
- Do you wanna go up there?

333
00:12:26,685 --> 00:12:29,268
- [Inspector Kerrigan] Come on.

334
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:36,060
- Okay, you have three tickets.

335
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,260
- Yes, I don't wish to contend,

336
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,700
I was just hoping that
you could, the late fees,

337
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,370
I was hoping that you could take those off

338
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,428
and I'd pay the tickets.

339
00:12:44,428 --> 00:12:45,261
- Okay.

340
00:12:47,197 --> 00:12:51,250
Do you have an excuse
for any of these tickets?

341
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,710
- I know that the one
on South Main Street,

342
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:56,003
I had put just one quarter in,

343
00:12:56,003 --> 00:12:58,400
because I was just going to get my BCI

344
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,635
and there was 20 people in there waiting,

345
00:13:00,635 --> 00:13:02,096
so they were backed up.

346
00:13:02,096 --> 00:13:04,010
- I wanna show you something,
so don't leave yet, okay?

347
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:06,620
- Okay.
- Okay, hold that.

348
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,810
Okay, you're gonna help
me out with these, okay?

349
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:09,643
- Okay.
- Alright,

350
00:13:09,643 --> 00:13:11,270
now I've got three choices

351
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,420
and these are the three choices,

352
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,478
I can charge your Mom

353
00:13:18,478 --> 00:13:22,890
number one is $50, right,

354
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:26,460
and number two is $100

355
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:30,903
and number three is $150.

356
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,143
So should I charge her number one,

357
00:13:34,143 --> 00:13:36,228
number two or number three?

358
00:13:36,228 --> 00:13:37,992
- Number one, Lenny.
- Oh, no, no.

359
00:13:37,992 --> 00:13:39,643
(court laughing)

360
00:13:39,643 --> 00:13:42,920
You can't help her, I've
gotta change it around now.

361
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,913
Okay?
- Okay.

362
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,817
- So what do you think?

363
00:13:48,817 --> 00:13:50,687
- Number one.
- Number one?

364
00:13:50,687 --> 00:13:53,440
Is that because your Mom helped you out?

365
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,273
It is, huh?

366
00:13:54,273 --> 00:13:55,230
(laughing)

367
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:58,120
I think she cheated a little
bit, what do you think?

368
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,020
- Yes.
- Oh, she thinks you cheated.

369
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,374
Okay, well, I asked you to help me,

370
00:14:03,374 --> 00:14:05,290
so I'm gonna take your recommendation,

371
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:06,854
it's gonna be $50, okay?
- Okay.

372
00:14:06,854 --> 00:14:08,613
- [Frank] Alright, thanks
for helping me out.

373
00:14:08,613 --> 00:14:10,830
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- Alright.

374
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,040
- Your fine was

375
00:14:14,247 --> 00:14:15,253
$980.

376
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,210
- Yes.
- What do you wanna say?

377
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,380
- First I am terribly sorry.
- No, I don't wanna hear it.

378
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:27,463
(light upbeat music)

379
00:14:28,564 --> 00:14:30,770
- [Announcer] Let's face it,

380
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:33,453
the world could use some more.

381
00:14:33,453 --> 00:14:36,096
♪ I'll celebrate ya ♪

382
00:14:36,096 --> 00:14:38,763
♪ Appreciate ya ♪

383
00:14:40,445 --> 00:14:42,450
- [Mother] Oh, another delay,

384
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:45,010
but you keep bouncing
like I'm a bouncy castle.

385
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,700
Oh yeah, five stop, zero leaks,

386
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,992
we're crushing this commute.

387
00:14:48,992 --> 00:14:50,120
(triumphant music)

388
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,350
- [Announcer] Huggies Little Movers,

389
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,700
our best-fitting diapers,
that fits like a hug.

390
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,007
Hugg On.

391
00:14:55,007 --> 00:14:56,140
(light melodic music)

392
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:59,570
- Shorten your cold by
almost half with Cold-Eeze.
