25
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:01,770
Millions all across the nation
are celebrating America.

26
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,750
So many events happening in our area,

27
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,120
they're happening right now.

28
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,210
The National Independence Day
Parade is just kicking off.

29
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,080
That happened just a short time ago

30
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,710
and for now, it looks like
the weather is cooperating

31
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,990
but we are bracing for some storms

32
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,160
and our Steve Rudin, he's got the timing

33
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,050
and he is tracking all of this for us.

34
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,260
Steve, happy 4th to you.

35
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,870
- Same to you Lindsey
and we are looking at

36
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,190
the greatest threat for
those stronger storms

37
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,370
or heavier downpours
later on this afternoon

38
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:28,770
into the early evening hours.

39
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,460
Looking downstream on the Potomac

40
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,730
from our camera atop The Watergate Hotel,

41
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,410
we are dry right now but
that is going to change

42
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:36,850
over the next several hours.

43
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:39,400
Do have a Flash Flood
Watch for the D.C Metro

44
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,950
including Montgomery
County, Fairfax, Arlington,

45

00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,450
until eight o'clock tonight.

48
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,450
Here's StormWatch7's Satellite and Radar.

49
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,340
A few showers beginning to bubble up

50
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,140
just across North East
D.C over toward Brookland

51
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,050
moving off toward the North and East.

52
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:59,110
Nothing heavy right now but
as mentioned that will change

53
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,860
as we head through the next several hours.

54
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,140
Here's our FutureCast.

55
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,060
This is the high resolution model.

56
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,617
We're gonna stop it for you at two o'clock

57
00:02:05,617 --> 00:02:07,980
and look at how quickly this model

58
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,840
has those storms popping up.

59
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,310
They don't move very fast.

60
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,390
Could bring heavy rains to the District,

61
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,730
Arlington and Alexandria four pm

62
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,410
and continue as we move into the

63
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:20,120
all important six o'clock,
seven o'clock hour.

64
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,060
If there's any good news here,
by eight o'clock tonight,

65
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,300
showers become more limited
and then the fireworks display

66
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:30,000
is set to begin at 21:07 should go on

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,180
at least according to this model here

68
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,510
although the cloud deck may be
a little bit on the low side.

69
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,890
Worth watching and we're
going to keep you updated.

70
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,180
Look at these temperatures.

71
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,090
88 degrees already at
Reagan National Airport.

72
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,780
That is just part of the story

73
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,590
with feels like temperatures
now in the middle 90s.

74
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,390
We have a heat emergency
posted for the District

75
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,450
that is done by the District government.

76
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,600
Cooling centers are open
for those who need them.

77
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,440
Coming up in a few
minutes, an updated look

78
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,210
at our FutureCast plus we're looking ahead

79
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:00,780
to the rest of the long holiday weekend.

80
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,620
Lindsey?

81
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,510
- All right Steve and

82
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,253
we do want to talk about that just

83
00:03:05,253 --> 00:03:07,870
the weather is holding up
so far for that National

84
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:11,090
Independence Day Parade and
our Nathan Baca is there.

85
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,280
So Nathan, happy 4th of July to you.

86
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,733
Just how crowded is it right now?

87
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:18,420
- Well it's getting more crowded.

88
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,820
I'm gonna show you the
situation right here.

89
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,440
I'm gonna do some crowd surfing over here.

90
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,480
So right now, I'm on

91
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,160
seventh approaching Constitution Avenue.

92
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,340
They are telling everybody
to move back from the street.

93
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,790
People wanna crowd onto the street.

94
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,520
In fact, I'm happening to kind
of move around some folks.

95
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,700
Hey, how's it going, happy
4th of July everyone.

96
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,137
So, this is what's going on right now.

97
00:03:34,137 --> 00:03:35,860
Just to give you context,

98
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,658
here's the National Archives over here

99
00:03:37,658 --> 00:03:38,941
(crowd of people cheer)

100
00:03:38,941 --> 00:03:41,160
and you see some people here
celebrating 4th of July.

101
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,150
Where you guys visiting from?

102
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,015
Anybody?

103
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,120
- Atlanta.
- Washington D.C.

104
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,760
- Oh good you guys are local, excellent.

105
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,950
Well we, just to give
you some context again,

106
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,363
police are telling people to stay on back.

107
00:03:52,363 --> 00:03:54,470
That right there is the Parade

108
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:57,710
and I'm gonna show you some
of the floats on down the way.

109
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,450
We've been noticing some bands.

110
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,640
People have been coming
here to hear those bands.

111
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,070
In fact, this is what some
people that were visiting,

112
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,940
not only from Alexandria
for the first time

113
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,763
but also from Georgia had to say.

114
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,220
- The reason why we're
out here is to celebrate

115
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,160
the independence from Great Britain.

116
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,090
Also our nation over the
last 243 years really

117
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,290
and then, to be amongst patriots.

118
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,490
- I don't see any controversy.

119
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,110
Like I see everybody
really coming together

120
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,668
and I'm just like, it makes me happy

121
00:04:23,668 --> 00:04:26,210
cause we're not seeing anything
so vulgar, anything ugly,

122
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,000
it just makes me happy that
everybody's here together

123
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,066
to celebrate such a great day.

124
00:04:30,066 --> 00:04:32,288
(marching band plays in background)

125
00:04:32,288 --> 00:04:33,520
- All right now I talked
about one of those bands.

126
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,930
You see one of those bands right there.

127
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,990
That is what she was coming to hear

128
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:38,760
and there are plenty more bands

129
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,770
and plenty more floats coming on by.

130
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,170
So again, the situation here,

131
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:46,110
we do have a lot more, I'll say,

132
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:49,570
a lot more political signs,
a lot more political hats

133
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:52,570
and advertisements that
typically you would see

134
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,010
on a 4th of July parade

135
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,540
but a lot of folks are here,

136
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,670
just coming in from all around the country

137
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:01,580
hoping to just get a good party
and a good old D.C parade.

138
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,670
Reporting live from
Constitution and Seventh,

139
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,320
Nathan Baca, ABC7 News.

140
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,710
- All right Nathan, enjoy it down there

141
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:10,250
and that is just one of many
parades going on in our area.

142
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,020
The streets of Arlington,

143
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,882
it was packed there for
the annual Barcroft Parade.

144
00:05:14,882 --> 00:05:16,170
(crowd cheers)

145
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,850
and this evening President Trump,

146
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,960
he is going to do his Salute to America

147
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,460
with an independence
extravaganza featuring tanks,

148
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,630
military flyovers and a
speech at The Lincoln Memorial

149
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,830
but some say the President

150
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,040
is politicizing a national holiday.

151
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,253
Mona Kosar Abdi has the very latest.

152
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,440
- [Mona] It will be "the
show of a lifetime",

153
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,240
President Trump has promised on Twitter

154
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,275
ahead of his extravagant
4th of July celebration.

155
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:43,330
(band plays)

156
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,340
A costly production,

157
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,310
Trump has also promised
will be worth the expense.

158
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,700
An array of military hardware on display

159
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,770
at The Lincoln Memorial including tanks

160
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:53,470
that have already been ushered in.

161
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:56,070
The Salute to America
spectacle will also include

162
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:59,770
multiple military flyovers
and an extended fireworks show

163
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,220
topped off with a speech

164
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,431
from the Commander and Chief himself.

165
00:06:03,431 --> 00:06:05,500
- We're gonna have planes going overhead.

166
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,960
The best fighter jets in the
world and other planes too.

167
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,160
- [Mona] But the event is setting off

168
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,040
more than pyrotechnic devices.

169
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,390
It's also sparking backlash from critics

170
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:17,430
who accused the President of
staging a glorified campaign

171
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:20,810
rally and turning the celebration
into a partisan event.

172
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:24,270
The event is free but The White
House has given VIP tickets

173
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,060
to Republican National
Committee and top donors.

174
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,910
Congressman and 2020 Democratic

175
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,960
Presidential candidate Seth Moulton,

176
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,300
calling Trump's celebration
quote "Unamerican".

177
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,350
- It reminds me of the Soviet Union.

178
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,360
It's unpatriotic because

179
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,130
that's, militarism is not what
American patriotism is about.

180
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,290
- As for the price tag,

181
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,440
neither the Administration
nor the Pentagon

182
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,180
has disclosed what the
cost will be to taxpayers

183
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,970
but ABC News has learned
the National Park Service

184
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,090
is reportedly diverting
2.5 million dollars

185
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,690
from improvement projects.

186
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,270
President Trump adding overnight,

187
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:00,467
the fireworks have been
donated and the cost will quote

188
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:02,993
"be very little compared
to what it is worth"

189
00:07:04,332 --> 00:07:07,730
and the $750000 worth of
fireworks were donated

190
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,610
by an Ohio company that lobbied
the President last month

191
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,760
to hold off on new tariffs on China.

192
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,620
The President announced he would do so

193
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,940
the same day he announced the donation.

194
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,290
Mona Kosar Abdi, ABC News, Washington.

195
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,520
- Security will be tight downtown today

196
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,990
and tonight for Independence
Day celebrations

197
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,390
and for President Trump's
Salute to America.

198
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,330
Each event has strict guidelines

199
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,470
on what you can bring and what you cannot.

200
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,280
The priority is safety.

201
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,150
No weapons, no alcohol,

202
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:38,050
not even drones or balloons are allowed

203
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,990
and for the Salute to America,

204
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:44,450
no backpacks, no large
purses, coolers or Tablets.

205
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:46,020
For a complete list, you can head over

206
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,490

209
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,610
whether you're heading to
events, wanting to avoid the city

210
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,040
or watching fireworks
in your neighborhood,

211
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,051
it is all on our free ABC7 News app.

212
00:08:02,051 --> 00:08:03,900
(fireworks bursting)

213
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,450
we have a reminder this
Independence Day that fireworks

214
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:09,880
are not toys and they
need to be used properly.

215
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,740
The Consumer Products Safety Commission,

216
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,700
they always do these demonstrations
on the National Mall.

217
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,450
This is what they did last week.

218
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,740
They like to do these demonstrations

219
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,300
to show just how quickly
things can go wrong

220
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,660
when fireworks are not handled properly.

221
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,070
New data reveals that
emergency rooms across the US

222
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,950
treated more than nine thousand

223
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:30,540
fireworks related injuries last year.

224
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,390
More than half of those injuries
involving young children

225
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:38,113
were caused by Sparklers.

226
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:43,440
Happening right now, the
103th Annual Nathan's Hot Dog

227
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,540
Eating Contest is going on
in Coney Island, New York

228
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,070
and 11 time champ Joey Chestnut

229
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,130
looks like he might make history again.

230
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,140
He set a world record last year,

231
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,390
he ate 74 hot dogs in 10 minutes.

232
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,920
We are monitoring that and of course,

233
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,250
we will have some video for you later.

Coming up next at noon,

235

236
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,000

the President and the protests.

and wherever you go, streaming
on the ABC7 News app.

295
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,600
- The Justice Department
is hitting reverse

296
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,540
on its course over the
Census' citizenship question.

297
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,360
President Trump tweeted that
the Department of Commerce

298
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,810
and DoJ are working hard on this holiday

299
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,340
to keep that question.

300
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,590
As Trevor Ault reports,
our judges ordered the

301
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:53,253
Administration to resolve
the conflict by tomorrow.

302
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,210
- [Trevor] A week removed
from a Supreme Court decision

303
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:58,190
blocking the Administration from adding

304
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:00,740
a citizenship question to the 2020 Census,

305
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,130
President Trump still
defiant tweeting that

306
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,850
the Department of Commerce
and the Department of Justice

307
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,340
are working very hard on
this even on the 4th of July.

308
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,870
That message contradicting
the Justice Department's

309
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,510
announcement that Census
forms were being printed

310
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:17,486
without the question
"Are you a US citizen?".

311
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,062
- I think it's very important to find out

312
00:12:19,062 --> 00:12:21,960
if somebody's a citizen
as opposed to an illegal.

313
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,320
- [Trevor] While the
President is insistent,

314
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,760
the fight for the citizenship
question is ongoing,

315
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,790
his comments have sparked confusion.

316
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,060
A Maryland Federal Judge
convened a conference call

317
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,780
Wednesday after she saw the
President's tweet saying

318
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,620
reports the question had
been dropped were fake.

319
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,560
On the call, Department of Justice lawyers

320
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,700
couldn't explain the President's rederick.

321
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,907
One lawyer saying quote

322
00:12:40,907 --> 00:12:43,180
"the tweet this morning
was the first I had heard

323
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,290
of the President's position on this issue.

324
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,840
I do not have a deeper
understanding of what that means

325
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,010
at this juncture other than
what the President has tweeted".

326
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,560
The Justice Department did admit

327
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,660
the President contradicted them but said

328
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,840
they have now been
instructed to explore whether

329
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,010
there's a path forward
consistent with the Supreme Court

330
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,040
to allow the citizenship question.

331
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,410
The Trump administration
had previously argued

332
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,230
they needed the Census question

333
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,430
to better enforce the Voting Rights Act

334
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,380
but Chief Justice John Roberts shot down

335
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,730
that line of thinking
calling it contrived.

336
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,540
- The Court ruled that the
citizenship question was not

337
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,900
about whatever cockamamie
reason Donal Trump gave for it.

338
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,610
- While the Department of
Justice is following the

339
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:23,510
President's instructions,
they are running low on time.

340
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,970
They only have until tomorrow
to explain to the courts

341
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,690
how they plan to comply with
the Supreme Court's ruling.

342
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:30,883
Trevor Ault, ABC News, Washington.

343
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,160
- We have an update following

344
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,420
Monday's violent protests in Hong Kong.

345
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,420
Hundreds of protestors wreaked havoc

346
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,780
inside the city's legislative building

347
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:43,350
and four of them are now
talking about why they did it.

348
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,770
They tell the associated press that

349
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:48,030
the refusal of city leaders
to listen to their demands

350
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,140
drove them to desperation

351
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:53,140
and they say that they concluded
peaceful demonstrations

352
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,550
were pointless after the
failure of Hong Kong's

353
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:58,773
pro-democracy umbrella movement in 2014.

354
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,820
Pretty sure a lot of you might have been

355
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,700
freaking out a little bit
after realizing your Instagram,

356
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,710
your Facebook, WhatsApp
accounts were not working

357
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,490
the way there supposed to yesterday.

358
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,670
Well those issues have been resolved.

359
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,830
Users on the social
media platforms say that

360
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:17,010
they were having trouble
uploading or sending images.

361
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:20,690
There's no word yet on what
may have caused that issue.

362
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:23,750
Team USA now knows who they will be facing

363
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,080
in the World Cup final on Sunday.

364
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,000
It will be the Netherlands.

365
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,760
They were able to knock out Sweden

366
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,240
with a goal in the 99th minute

367
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,500
to punch their ticket to the final.

368
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,630
The good news for team USA,

369
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:40,448
co-captain Megan Rapinoe says that

370
00:14:40,448 --> 00:14:43,210
she will be ready to go on Sunday

371
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:45,793
after missing the
semi-finals against England.

372
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:49,520
It's the largest flying display

373
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,690
of the stars and stripes in the nation.

374
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,330
The PNC American Flag balloon was inflated

375
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:57,210
this morning in Ridgefield, New Jersey

376
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:59,530
all in celebration of Independence Day.

377
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:02,130
That hot air balloon is five stories tall.

378
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:04,840
A pilot from Pennsylvania created it

379
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,090
after the attacks on 9/11.

380
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:09,570
The balloon is flown in
the New York City area

381
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:12,060
every year since then.

382
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,540
That's ginormous.

383
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,836
- Yeah, really big.
- Yeah

384
00:15:14,836 --> 00:15:15,669
- All right--
- and you have to have

385
00:15:15,669 --> 00:15:16,510
perfect weather for that too.

386
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,450
- For them, yes.
- Yeah.

387
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:20,150
- For today, not gonna want
to fly a hot air balloon.

388
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,880
So a lot to talk about moving
through the afternoon hours.

389
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,480
Crowds are beginning to build.

390
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,620
Heat emergency for the
District so stay hydrated

391
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:30,290
and the best news of
all, not everyone has AC

392
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,450
so cooling centers are
now open in the District.

393
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:33,560
So, good news there.

394
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,070
Do want to show you this time lapse

395
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:38,980
and this is our Skylapse7
for you showing Northwest D.C

396
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,060
and you can see,

397
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,200
actually the clouds
beginning to move on in.

398
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,710
These clouds will eventually produce

399
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,370
some heavier amounts of rain

400
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:46,980
as we move through the afternoon hours

401
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,140
and that's why we have a Flash Flood Watch

402
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,590
for parts of the area.

403
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,500
Live view right now, there are the clouds.

404
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,400
We are going to keep clouds in place.

405
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,090
Tidal Basin, looking quiet for right now

406
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,570
but we know those crowds are
definitely going to build

407
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,640
and then our camera atop the Watergate,

408
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,140
looking good right now although

409
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:05,417
it is on the hot and humid side.

410
00:16:05,417 --> 00:16:07,780
88 degrees at Reagan National this hour.

411
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,140
88 in Leesberg.

412
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,400
85 degrees in Warrenton.

413
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,570
85 in Fredericksburg.

414
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,680
Do want to show you these
feels like temperatures.

415
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,190
Well into the middle to upper 90s

416
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,700
inside and around the Beltway.

417
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,540
Already feels like 104
degrees over Annapolis.

418
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,600
StormWatch7 Satellite and Radar does show

419
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,040
a few showers developing
North of Montgomery County

420
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,460
with some heavier downpours
inside the Capital Beltway.

421
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,610
Head off to the Cheltenham area,

422
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,430
over toward Laurel and Bowie,

423
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,530
that's where you're looking
at a few showers right now

424
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:39,510
but the showers and heavier
downpours are going to become

425
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,970
more prolific moving
through the afternoon hours.

426
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:45,130
Here's the latest for you
on the Flash Flood Watch

427
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,340
for the District, Arlington, Alexandria,

428
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,220
also Fairfax and Prince
William, parts of Loudoun,

429
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,230
Montgomery and Prince George's County.

430
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,090
As until eight o'clock tonight,

431
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,158
the all important FutureCast,

432
00:16:56,158 --> 00:16:57,980
this is our high resolution model,

433
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,020
look at the heavy rain forecast

434
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,660
at two o'clock this afternoon.

435
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,840
Montgomery County and at Prince
George's over toward Andrews

436
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,220
and as we head through
the three o'clock hour,

437
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:10,670
once again the potential for
torrential downpours at the

438
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:14,550
District over toward North
East and upper North West D.C

439
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,170
and then we'll do it all over again

440
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,470
for the five o'clock and six o'clock hour

441
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,400
before things start to
settle down just a little bit

442
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,210
but some of these slow moving storms

443
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:26,030
capable of producing upwards
of two inches of rain

444
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,990
over a relatively short period of time

445
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,510
and by eleven o'clock tonight,

446
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,740
a little bit of patchy fog

447
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,570
but most of the storms are out of here.

448
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,320
Here's your 4th of July outlook

449
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,100
as we move through this afternoon.

450
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,110
Stay weather alert, temperatures
will be in the lower 90s.

451
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:41,540
Feels like temperatures
even hotter than that

452
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,780
with feels like temperatures
upper 90s to near 100 degrees.

453
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,250
Now waking up tomorrow morning,

454
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,500
it's hot and it's soupy once again.

455
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,480
Temperatures that will be in the 70s.

456
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,590
Highs tomorrow will eventually make it

457
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,230
into the upper 80s to around 90 degrees.

458
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,690
Unsettled again tomorrow

459
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:59,360
so grab the umbrella as you head outdoors.

460
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,790
Always download your
StormWatch7 Weather app

461
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,440
or at least have it ready to go.

462
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,290
It's gonna come in great
use later on this afternoon

463
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:09,160
especially if you're going
to find that perfect place

464
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,540
to watch the fireworks,

465
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:13,120
not only at the National
Mall but throughout the area.

466
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,660
Here's your seven day outlook Lindsey

467
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:18,240
and we have temperatures at
or above 90 degrees tomorrow

468
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,080
and Saturday and then a
little bit of a cool down

469
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,360
but to pinpoint exactly who's going to see

470
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,010
the heaviest of the rain, our
models do a pretty good job

471
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:30,330
in showing that over the
District and Arlington

472
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:33,533
and Alexandria, moving
through early to mid afternoon

473
00:18:33,533 --> 00:18:35,470
into the early evening hours,

474
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:39,180
fingers crossed 21:07 tonight
we'll get all this out of here

475
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,710
but my other concern is a low cloud deck.

476
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:42,740
- Okay.
- Two years ago,

477
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,680
we had the fireworks.
- Right.

478
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,040
- Would of been beautiful
but when they shot up,

479
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,800
they disappeared and all
you saw were flashes.

480
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,633
So,
- Right.

481
00:18:48,633 --> 00:18:49,910
- Could happen again this year.

482
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,330
- All right, so hopefully,

483
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,540
I'm gonna be an optimist here
- Yes.

484
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,140
- And say, fingers crossed,

485
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,213
hopefully all will go according

486
00:18:55,213 --> 00:18:57,230
- I hope so.
- To our plan.

487
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,550
- We'll have a new update coming in.

As families head to the
beach this Independence Day,

544
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:33,310
we have got another reminder
of how important sunscreen is.

545
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:36,100
So parents, if you don't remind your kids,

546
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,070
odds are they may not
be putting it on at all

547
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:41,420
and when they do, are
they applying enough?

548
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:45,722
Becky Worley has the eye-opening
sunscreen experiment.

549
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:47,100
(upbeat music)

550
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,580
- [Becky] You know how
kids feel about sunscreen?

551
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,413
They hate it.

552
00:21:50,413 --> 00:21:52,770
- I don't want sunscreen on.

553
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:53,960
I don't need it.

554
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,390
- I get annoyed.

555
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,370
- Sunscreen's icky.

556
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:57,740
- It's quite annoying.

557
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,680
- [Becky] But parents know it's a must.

558
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,580
The American Academy of Dermatology says

559
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,920
even one blistering childhood sunburn

560
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,900
is a contributor to
later life skin cancer.

561
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,600
So while the CDC says
children of all skin tones

562
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,840
should wear sunscreen regularly,

563
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,350
past research shows nearly
four in 10 kids don't.

564
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,440
Why?

565
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,370
Well I submit this
reenactment from my daughter.

566
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:21,230
- Put on sunscreen Emmy.

567
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:23,820
No I don't wanna put on sunscreen.

568
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,653
- It's a battle.

569
00:22:24,653 --> 00:22:25,906
That's what I get.

570
00:22:25,906 --> 00:22:26,940
(squeals in anguish)

571
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:27,860
Mom, stop.

572
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,720
But Holly Thaggard, a former
elementary school teacher

573
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,960
and founder of her own
sunscreen company, Supergoop!

574
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,850
says there is an alternative.

575
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:37,940
- If you're old enough to brush your teeth

576
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,270
and wash your hands,

577
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:41,290
you're old enough to
do your own sunscreen.

578
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:42,330
- Really?

579
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:44,090
Okay, let's try.

580
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:47,060
We're using a special camera
fitted with a UV Sensor.

581
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,230
When sunscreen goes on,

582
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:51,480
it shows up as black and
highlights any missed spots.

583
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,270
We start with seven to nine year olds

584
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:55,540
to see if their application is thorough.

585
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,550
The kids put it on then we
review what they missed.

586
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:02,050
- As each of these children
apply, none of them hit the ears

587
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:06,390
and the ears are actually
very vulnerable to sun damage.

588
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,960
- [Becky] Another frequent miss.

589
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,600
- [Holly] Children forget to apply it

590
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,150
right on into the hairline.

591
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,570
- [Becky] And something all the
younger kids struggled with,

592
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:15,952
not using enough sunscreen.

593
00:23:15,952 --> 00:23:16,785
- Aw oh.

594
00:23:16,785 --> 00:23:18,297
- When I come over here, what do you see?

595
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:21,940
- Uh, I missed a lot of spots.
(Becky laughs)

596
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,760
- [Becky] Holly says the
younger kids are afraid

597
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,180
of getting sunscreen
in their mouth or eyes.

598
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,020
- We're missing a few critical spots

599
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,460
right around the eye
area which is often where

600
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,970
sun damage is first detected from an aging

601
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,770
and a skin cancer perspective.

602
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:36,250
- [Becky] And a study showed kids using

603
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,010
just one quarter of the
amount of sunscreen needed

604
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:41,410
to get the protection
listed on the bottle.

605
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:42,870
Moving up to the older group,

606
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:46,000
the 11 to 12 year olds
were much more consistent.

607
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,970
Devin used a lot of
sunscreen and so did Gus,

608
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,910
also an 11 year old who
seemed to get the why.

609
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:54,500
- I feel like I try to
avoid it but I shouldn't

610
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,180
cause I know that having a
grandpa who had skin cancer,

611
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,940
so I shouldn't get it,
try to prevent that.

612
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,030
That's a lot isn't it?

613
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,780
- [Becky] But Holly says
he's doing it right.

614
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:05,680
- Use enough to where you're
applying it so that you can see

615
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:09,200
it on your skin and then rub
it in until you can't see it.

616
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,000
- [Becky] All the kids
said they learned a lot

617
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,870
and the takeaway, start them young

618
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:15,330
but kids 10 and under
need a lot of coaching

619
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,823
to get adequate protection.

620
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,240
- I always like the spray stuff.

621
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,077
Adults don't like it that much either.

622
00:24:22,077 --> 00:24:24,770
All right now in our area, our weather,

623

636

right here in the USA.

637
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:08,100
Every MyPillow is made with
passion here in my home state

638
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:12,160
of Minnesota to ensure you get
the best sleep of your life.

639
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,120
- One of the things that I
really like about MyPillow

640
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,330
is the support.

641
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:19,240
It gives my neck a little hug.

642
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,060
- I've never slept better in my life.

643
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,050
What's better than a great night's sleep.

644
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:25,390
- Sleep is one of the most
important things to your health

645
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,230
and MyPillow is one of the most important

646

Call or go online now.

652
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,780
I tried every pillow

653
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,540
from expensive down
pillows that just went flat

654
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,760
to fiber filled pillows

655
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,120
that rebound every time
you move your head.

656
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,700
I even tried those memory
foam pillows and the curve

657
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,820
did not match my neck and it
probably won't match yours.

658
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,328
That's why I invented MyPillow.

659
00:25:56,328 --> 00:25:59,840
My patented fill adjust to
your exact individual needs

660
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,130
and helps keep your neck
supported and aligned.

661
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:05,040
- When I got myPillow,

662
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,750
I'm asleep almost immediately.

663
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,860
I stay asleep at night and I wake up

664
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,940
more well rested in the morning.

665
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,610

686
00:27:06,713 --> 00:27:07,740
We're talking about the weather

687
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,943
and it's the rain that we're
really keeping our eye on.

688
00:27:09,943 --> 00:27:13,180
- Yeah and slow moving clusters of

689
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,590
wet weather that could bring
some very heavy downpours.

690
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,870
That's why we have a Flash Flood Watch

691
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,890
for the areas that are shaded
in green and more important,

692
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,470
the District, Arlington, Alexandria,

693
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:24,070
so many people trying to
find that perfect place

694
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,650
to find the fireworks this week

695
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:27,270
or this week, this evening.

696
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,620
This is what we expect
in terms of this evening.

697
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,630
We're going to call for
temperatures that are going to be

698
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:35,610
on the hot side and then by
two o'clock this afternoon,

699
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:39,090
look how the areas of
yellows and oranges of red

700
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,020
really begin to pop up on the screen.

701
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,190
Three o'clock and I'm gonna
stop this at four o'clock,

702
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:45,760
five o'clock, a little bit
of a lull but keep in mind,

703
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,100
this is just a computer simulation.

704
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,590
So these may be off, four, five miles.

705
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:53,190
In the big picture, that's not a lot

706
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:55,340
but it could make a
huge difference whether

707
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,530
it's over the District or
whether it's in Fauquier County

708
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:00,510
or whether it's in
Northern Montgomery County.

709
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:03,370
So everyone has a very
good chance of heavy rain

710
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:05,630
moving through the afternoon
into the evening hour.

711
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:08,610
- So, is everyone going
to be affected or possibly

712
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:11,219
just some people we don't
exactly know where just yet.

713
00:28:11,219 --> 00:28:12,420
- We don't know exactly where.
- Okay.

714
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,270
- But pretty much everyone.
- All right.

715
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,899
- At this point.
- Thanks Steve.

716
00:28:15,899 --> 00:28:17,320
- I wish I had better news.
(chuckles)

717
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,690
- We're gonna keep
tracking it for you though

718
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:19,960
and of course we have the app as well

719
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,590
so you can watch the
radar along with Steve

720
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,760
and we'll be back right after this.

721
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,177
(band plays)

722
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:36,330
- Hey, did you hear the big news?

your joints

00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:57,993

your brain.

735
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:08,140

discovered in jellyfish,

00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,350
Prevagen has been shown in clinical trials

He's dancing like nobody's watching

- [Narrator] Now, ABC7
News At Noon, on your side.

776
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:44,040
- Americans are ready to celebrate

777
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,010
the Independence Day
holiday in variety of ways.

778
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:48,850
From barbecues to fireworks

779
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:51,650
and meanwhile officials in
cities all across the nation

780
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:53,490
are taking precautions to keep

781
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:56,070
their large gatherings safe and secure.

782
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:58,520
Karin Caper is on Coney Island Boardwalk

783
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,700
in Brooklyn, New York.

784
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,890
That's where they're gearing up

785
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:03,550
for a very big day which
is already underway.

786
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,383
Karin?

787
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,470
- On the national level,

788
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:10,440
federal agencies say no
specific credible threats

789
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,290
against the holiday but law enforcement

790
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:14,320
will remain vigilant whether it's at

791
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,660
the major celebrations
like here in New York

792
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:19,760
or down in D.C or one of
the smaller celebrations

793
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,743
taking place across the country today.

794
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,880
Independence Day celebrations
set across the country

795
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,040
and AAA forecasts nearly
49 million Americans

796
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,000
making a getaway to celebrate.

797
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,460
- We see unemployment is low.

798
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,510
Americans have additional disposal income.

799
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:36,410
So, they're taking that
additional money and putting it

800
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:39,400
towards a trip with friends
and family this year.

801
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,620
- [Karin] In Washington, President Trump

802
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:43,420
will deliver a speech at The
Lincoln Memorial in addition to

803
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:46,170
the traditional fireworks
over the National Mall

804
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:49,370
and for the massive fireworks
display here in New York,

805
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:52,390
prime viewing spots will be
under the eye of the NYPD

806
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:55,180
with patrols in the air
and on the waterways.

807
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,740
Crowd safety measures will include

808
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:59,630
bag checks and thousands
of officers on duty.

809
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:01,280
- This is what the NYPD does.

810
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,643
We have so many large
events during the year.

811
00:32:03,643 --> 00:32:05,262
We'll be ready, everybody come on down,

812
00:32:05,262 --> 00:32:06,960
it's gonna be a great show.

813
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,310
- The National Retail
Federation estimates Americans

814
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:13,600
will spend $6.7 billion
on 4th of July barbecues.

815
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,600
Here at Coney Island,

816
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,540
they'll take things a few steps further.

817
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,680
At the corner of Surf
and Stillwell Avenues,

818
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,963
crowds will gather for the Annual

819
00:32:19,963 --> 00:32:22,170
Nathans Hot Dog Eating Contest

820
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:25,100
watching competitors like
Gideon OG and Juliet Lee

821
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:28,150
who qualified at Washington's
Capital Barbecue Battle.

822
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,640
Contestants have 10 minutes

823
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,860
to down as many hot dogs
and buns as they can

824
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,700
and reigning men's champion Joey Chestnut

825
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,050
has won the competition
here 11 of the last 12 years

826
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:44,340
and last year, he set a
record with 74 hot dogs.

827
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,950
That might seem like a lot but
it is just a small fraction

828
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:49,130
of the 150 million hot dogs

829
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:51,770
Americans are expected to consume today.

830
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:54,570
At Brooklyn's Coney
Island, I'm Karin Caifa.

831
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:56,190
- And now to our weather.

832
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,023
Steve,
(band plays)

833
00:32:57,023 --> 00:33:00,180
it's looking pretty
calm out there right now

834
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,100
but there are storms a brewing.

835
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,340
We can only hope that it
won't rain on anyone's parade

836
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,410
and we're listening to
that live music there

837
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:08,430
which is oh so nice

838
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:10,200
and of course we want them to be dry

839
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,140
when they're preforming.

840
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,160
- Yeah absolutely.

841
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,650
Unfortunately as we move
through the mid afternoon hours

842
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:17,640
into early evening, it's
gonna get wet around here.

843
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,830
To pinpoint exactly who's
going to see the heaviest rain,

844
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:24,140
best chances will be inside
and around the Capital Beltway.

845
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,260
That's where we already have

846
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,470
a Flash Flood Watch that's been posted

847
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:29,360
starting at one o'clock this afternoon

848
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,940
and extending until eight o'clock tonight.

849
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:35,050
StormWatch7 Satellite and Radar,
what's going on right now,

850
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:36,990
a few showers beginning to erupt

851
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:40,060
North and East of town,
nothing that is terribly heavy.

852
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,810
That heads to the Montgomery County,

853
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:44,500
Frederick County border
over toward Urbana,

854
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,000
North of Gaithersburg,

855
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,410
even a bit of thunder
and lightning right now.

856
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:50,810
Here's the latest for
you on our FutureCast

857
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:52,790
and this just updated for us.

858
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:55,890
Notice the showers,
thunderstorms begin to pop up

859
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:57,560
as we head through the two o'clock hour

860
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,700
becoming more numerous and
heavy as we head through

861
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,570
the four o'clock hour and then by six pm,

862
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:06,460
could be looking at a
heavier cell over Manassas,

863
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,930
over into Fairfax and
whether or not that moves

864
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:12,210
over the District or just pours itself out

865
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:14,050
is still yet to be determined.

866
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:15,810
Let's talk about temperatures right now.

867
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:17,670
88 degrees at Reagan National

868
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,400
but that's just part of the story.

869
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,110
We feel like the middle to upper 90s

870
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:24,220
to close to 100 degrees.

871
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,420
Coming up in a few minutes,

872
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:27,820
we'll show you FutureCast one more time

873
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,690
plus we're looking ahead
through the fireworks tonight

874
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:32,480
and then the upcoming weekend.

875
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,120
All that and much more coming up, Lindsey?

876
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:35,953
- Steve, thank you.

877
00:34:35,953 --> 00:34:40,110
This 4th of July, ABC wants
to honor a true American hero.

878
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:42,780
A pilot who flew more than 400 missions

879
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,500
in three different wars.

880
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,540
It's a story that is very
close to Robin Roberts' heart

881
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,703
because of her own family legacy.

882
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,800
- On this July 4th, we
are giving the opportunity

883
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,570
to reflect on our rich history and those

884
00:34:56,570 --> 00:35:00,320
who have served our country,
who protected and fought

885
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,390
for our freedom, the freedom
that we enjoy to this day.

886
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:05,730
No one better exemplifies this sentiment

887
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:07,890
than a true American patriot.

888
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:12,159
Bronze star, World War II
veteran, Colonel Charles McGee.

889
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:14,649
(upbeat music)
(crowd applauds)

890
00:35:14,649 --> 00:35:15,649
- Thank you.

891
00:35:18,281 --> 00:35:19,550
Thank you so much.

892
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,100
- Thank you for serving.

893
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:24,310
- [Robin] 30 years in the
Air Force, 409 missions

894
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:26,460
and 99 years young,

895
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:29,510
Colonel Charles McGee is an American hero.

896
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:32,960
Wherever he goes in his iconic
Tuskegee Airmen red blazer,

897
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,807
all eyes are on him.

898
00:35:34,807 --> 00:35:36,091
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

899
00:35:36,091 --> 00:35:37,454
- Thank you for your service sir.

900
00:35:37,454 --> 00:35:38,460
- Appreciate that.

901
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,080
- [Robin] The Colonel, one of
the first black Fighter pilots

902
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:44,840
who battled the enemy abroad
and segregation back home.

903
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,928
- The black American second class citizens

904
00:35:47,928 --> 00:35:51,850
who digged dirt, built roads,
drive trucks, cook food

905
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:54,632
but do anything technical, impossible.

906
00:35:54,632 --> 00:35:56,460
- [Robin] But the Tuskegee Airmen made

907
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,110
the seemingly impossible, possible

908
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:03,160
completing over 1200 combat
missions during World War II.

909
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,110
- You might say the Air
Force really led our country

910
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:10,970
in providing equal access and
equal opportunity for all.

911
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:13,550
- [Robin] On this day of
Independence, Colonel McGee

912
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,970
reminds us to set aside our differences

913
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:18,360
and stand united as a country.

914
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,270
- We are all American now.

915
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:24,010
Why they want to, for me say
oh you're African American.

916
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:25,650
What are you, German American?

917
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,880
And realize that it's
one of the big challenges

918
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,520
of today to recognize
all for who they are,

919
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,420
what they do and how they carry themselves

920
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,110
in supporting our country.

921
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:39,152
How's school?

922
00:36:39,152 --> 00:36:40,624
- Oh good, good.
- Good?

923
00:36:40,624 --> 00:36:41,457
- We're doing good.
- Keep it good.

924
00:36:41,457 --> 00:36:42,713
You know why?

925
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,307
You're the future of the country.

926
00:36:45,307 --> 00:36:48,720
And I love that and that's
what I try to pass on

927
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,230
young folks as they develop
their talents and find them.

928
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,360
Hopefully they put their finger

929
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,700
on something they enjoy doing.

930
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,850
You realize that you have to reach out

931
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:59,880
and share those experiences.

932
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,670
When folks ask how are things?

933
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:03,893
I just have to say life is a blessing.

934
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:08,710
- The Tuskegee Airmen also
known as the Red Tails

935
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:10,210
and I am an honorary member,

936
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:12,690
that's why I have my red blazer.

937
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:15,250
I'm also honored that I am the daughter

938
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:19,060
of a Tuskegee Airman,
Colonel Lawrence E. Roberts

939
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,720
and like Colonel McGee,

940
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,340
he shared his secret to
success with his children

941
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,920
and Colonel McGee's are
the four Ps he calls them.

942
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,440
Perceive, prepare, perform and persevere.

943
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,300
Sounds a lot like my daddy.

944
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,740
Many thanks to the friends of

945
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:36,160
the National World War II
Monument and the daughters

946
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,170
of the American Revolution for letting us

947
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:39,910
use their beautiful spaces.

948
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:41,220
We really did appreciate it.

949
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,713
Happy 4th of July.

950
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,700

is quality furniture and
I give you a discount,

Bob, you look so young.

00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,610
- Do you remember?

969
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,473
- It's not discount furniture,

970
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:39,255
it's quality furniture at a discount.

1008
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:06,550
who continues to dominate
opponents twice her age

Ian Pannell is in Wimbledon and has,

1010
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:13,240
or is at Wimbledon and has more
on Coco Gauff's latest win.

1011
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,830
- [Ian] Overnight, this fairytale

sailed into the third round

victory coming just two days

1019
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:39,520
after the American teen
sensation rocked the tennis world

1020
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,400
with a first round victory
over her idol Venus Williams.

1021
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:47,000
- [Commentator] It's a dream

bringing the praise and
approval of some of the greats.

1024
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,040
- Hey there she is.

1025
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:54,952
How's everything?
- Good.

1026
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,012
- Congratulations, great job.
- Thank you.

1027
00:40:56,012 --> 00:40:57,020
- When are you playing?

1028
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,264
- Last on court two.

1029
00:40:58,264 --> 00:40:59,774
- Oh okay, play well.

1030
00:40:59,774 --> 00:41:00,817
- Thank you.
- Cheers, bye.

1031
00:41:00,817 --> 00:41:03,640
- You got that on camera?
(laughs)

1032
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,270
I can lie and say it wasn't hard

1033
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:08,450
but it was definitely hard to
reset all this buzz going on

1034
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:10,830
and I was just telling myself if you want

1035
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:13,220
more moments like that, you
got to continue to work hard

1036
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,520
and continue to stay focused.

1037
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,280
- [Ian] But reset she did, on Wednesday

1038
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:20,111
defeating Slovakia's Magdalena Rybarikova.

1039
00:41:20,111 --> 00:41:22,460
(crowd cheers and applauds)

1040
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:24,390
The packed house and her proud parents

1041
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:26,952
on their feet in a rare ovation.

1042
00:41:26,952 --> 00:41:28,843
- [Commentator] And she
did it with such style.

1043
00:41:28,843 --> 00:41:30,600
- Everything has come together.

1044
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,050
I am so proud of my daughter.

1045
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:36,560
Watching her, the maturity
that she has developed

1046
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,720
in this last week and a half, two weeks.

1047
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,340
- Obviously she wants
to win the tournament

1048
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:42,410
but regardless of the outcome, for me

1049
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:44,840
we've already had a success
cause we've come here

1050
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,430
and we've seen growth in her.

1051
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:48,660
- [Ian] Coco now the
youngest woman to advance

1052
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:52,100
to Wimbledon's third round since 1991

1053
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,950
and she's not intimidated.

1054
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:56,790
- I think I can beat anyone
who's across the court

1055
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:58,910
and if I don't think I can win the match

1056
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:01,330
then I won't even step on the court.

1057
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:02,400
- She's on the top of her game

1058
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,720
and you are on the top of yours today.

1059
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,790
You are looking at the forecast
with a fine tooth comb.

1060
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:09,420
- Absolutely and a lot to
talk about, hour by hour

1061
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,430
as we move through the afternoon.

1062
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:12,260
This right here is Skylapse7

1063
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,640
and look at the boat
traffic on the Potomac.

1064
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,460
Up and down, everyone's trying

1065
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,380
to get from point A to point B.

1066
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,410
This is what it looks like,

1067
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:23,000
a live view for you right now
showing our skies are hazy

1068
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,510
and cloudy, at least it's dry
inside the Capital Beltway.

1069
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:29,180
Over toward Friendship
Heights and Chevy Chase,

1070
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,820
clouds continue to build

1071
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:32,560
and our next stop, the Tidal Basin,

1072
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,040
traffic look at that,
doesn't look that bad

1073
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,810
but a lot of roadways are
closed so be sure to check

1074
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:42,110
with ABC7, WJLA.com for
the latest traffic maps.

1075
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:44,230
88 degrees right now at Reagan National,

1076
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:45,720
87 Manassas,

1077
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,680
feels like temperatures
already at 100 in Leesburg,

1078
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,780
feels like 96 degrees at
Reagan National Airport.

1079
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,840
A heat emergency for the District.

1080
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,250
That means cooling centers

1081
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:57,220
are now open throughout the District.

1082
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:59,940
So if you don't have AC or you
need a place to take a break,

1083
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:01,190
that's where you need to go.

1084
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:03,500
Heat index values throughout the afternoon

1085
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,800
well into the 90s.

1086
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,160
Some of these heavier
downpours will cool us down

1087
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,830
but it's still gonna stay
really sticky out there

1088
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:12,270
moving through this
afternoon into this evening.

1089
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:13,680
StormWatch7 Satellite and Radar,

1090
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,750
look at the showers,

1091
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:17,070
the heavier rain already
beginning to blossom

1092
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:19,230
North of Gaithersburg, up toward Urbana,

1093
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:22,450
Barnesville, Damascus, all
looking at wet weather right now.

1094
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:25,000
The same for Lanham,
nothing that is severe

1095
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,780
but slow moving storms
capable of producing

1096
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:30,520
very heavy rain over
a short period of time

1097
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:33,560
and also the potential for
localized flash flooding.

1098
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,110
Flash Flood Watch goes
into effect at one o'clock

1099
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:38,150
this afternoon until
eight o'clock tonight.

1100
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:40,290
All the areas that are shaded in green.

1101
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:41,550
Here's our FutureCast.

1102
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:43,710
I'm gonna stop this for you hour by hour

1103
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:45,650
moving through this afternoon and evening.

1104
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:48,060
Notice the wet weather,
develops two o'clock,

1105
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,720
three o'clock, North and East of D.C.

1106
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,070
The Eastern edge of the Capital Beltway.

1107
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:54,690
Moving into the four o'clock hour,

1108
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:57,600
a little bit of a lull
at least for the District

1109
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,190
but then by five pm,
we could be looking at

1110
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:03,220
heavier rains just off toward
the South at West of us.

1111
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,560
The big question mark,

1112
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,870
where will these storms set up exactly?

1113
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:08,020
Will it be over the District?

1114
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,450
Will it be over Fairfax?

1115
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:11,360
It's anyone's guess at this point.

1116
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,130
What I can recommend, if you're going out

1117
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:15,610
to the National Mall,
take extreme caution,

1118
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:17,880
make sure that you have
a secure place to go

1119
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,590
should you find some of these
heavier downpours overhead.

1120
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:22,830
If there's any good
news with this forecast,

1121
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:24,530
moving into the nine o'clock hour,

1122
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:27,050
heaviest of the rain begins to diminish

1123
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:30,000
and the chances for the heavier
rain will begin to ease.

1124
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,330
By 11 o'clock tonight, a
lot of folks going home,

1125
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:34,150
things should begin to
improve just a little bit

1126
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:36,280
although we may see a
little bit of patchy fog.

1127
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,900
For this afternoon and into
the evening for the fireworks,

1128
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,820
temperatures will be in the 80s.

1129
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:42,410
Waking up early tomorrow morning,

1130
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:44,580
temperatures are in the 70s once again,

1131
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:46,150
very warm, very humid.

1132
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:47,540
Highs tomorrow will make it into

1133
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:50,560
the mid to upper 80s
to close to 90 degrees

1134
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,890
and we are looking at yet another round

1135
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:55,420
of wet weather through
the afternoon hours.

1136
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:57,880
Seven day outlook from StormWatch7,

1137
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:00,760
91 on Saturday, 87 degrees on Sunday,

1138
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:04,100
we drop back down to the
80s come early next week.

1139
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,000
Lindsey?

1140
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:05,850
- All right Steve, thank you

1141
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:09,310
and Seven is on your side
with a Summer holiday warning.

1142
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:12,530
According to the CDC,
drowning is the leading cause

1143
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:15,980
of unintentional deaths in
children ages one to four.

1144
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:17,970
So before you head to
the pool or the beach

1145
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:20,810
to celebrate the 4th, Gio
Benitez is taking a look

1146
00:45:20,810 --> 00:45:23,647
at how to keep your family safe.

1147
00:45:23,647 --> 00:45:24,900
(water splashes)

1148
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:27,240
- [Gio] It looks like any
other Summer pool party.

1149
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,080
Young people splashing in the water,

1150
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:31,090
parents enjoying the barbecue

1151
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:34,210
but somewhere in this pool,
five different swimmers

1152
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:36,820
are about to simulate
that they're drowning

1153
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:40,230
and we're wondering if these
moms and dads can spot them.

1154
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:42,330
Drowning can happen in just seconds

1155
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:43,950
and it's often difficult to spot.

1156
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:46,900
It's happening to someone in
this public pool right now.

1157
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:48,240
Can you spot it?

1158
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,508
There she is.

1159
00:45:49,508 --> 00:45:51,640
(whistle blows)

1160
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:54,560
Fortunately a lifeguard spots
her and makes the rescue.

1161
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,300
But it's in residential pools

1162
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,380
where lifeguards usually aren't present

1163
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,950
that the majority of drownings take place.

1164
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:04,250
Safety experts say part of the
reason, distracted parents.

1165
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:07,170
Talking on their phones,
grilling, socializing

1166
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:10,610
and supervising other children
with no water watcher,

1167
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:13,520
a person with eyes on
the water at all times.

1168
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,350
So we've invited this group
of parents to a pool party,

1169
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:19,800
assigning them tasks like
running that grill and of course,

1170
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,880
tending to their own young kids.

1171
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:24,260
We've also added swimmers
splashing in the pool

1172
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:27,460
but those swimmers are
actually trained lifeguards

1173
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:30,310
and swim instructors from
Swim Jim's swim school

1174
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:32,440
skilled in mimicking a drowning.

1175
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:35,150
The parents know they're here
to learn about water safety

1176
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:38,320
with some sort of demonstration
beginning in about an hour

1177
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,850
but since drowning often happens
when you least expect it,

1178
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:43,227
we begin right now.

1179
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:46,360
With cameras rolling,
I watch from a garage

1180
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,780
just next to the pool
observing some parents

1181
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:51,230
checking the water but
mostly they're focused on

1182
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:52,880
their assignments and the party

1183
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,250
and after 30 minutes,

1184
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:55,320
there we go, she went under,

1185
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:58,610
our swim instructor Kelly
begins simulating a drowning,

1186
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:00,880
struggling to keep her head above water,

1187
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,770
arms clawing for the surface

1188
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:06,240
and just like the real thing,
she barely makes a sound.

1189
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,040
Meanwhile, our guests seem not to notice.

1190
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,650
More than a minute goes by.

1191
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:13,050
She's still struggling
and nobody's looking.

1192
00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:15,670
We're now looking at more
than two and a half minutes

1193
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:18,630
and still nobody notices a thing.

1194
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:20,380
After more than four minutes,

1195
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:23,940
she simulates a worst case
scenario and stops moving.

1196
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:27,230
Remember, she's a trained
professional and is just acting.

1197
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:30,290
Josh from the American Red
Cross has been watching with us.

1198
00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:34,030
Four and a half minutes, still
no parent noticed anything.

1199
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:35,690
- Right.
- Does that surprise you?

1200
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:36,523
- It does not.

1201
00:47:36,523 --> 00:47:38,140
- [Gio] Kelly goes back to swimming

1202
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:39,820
and we cue another swimmer

1203
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:41,450
and another

1204
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:42,323
and another,

1205
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:47,630
all mimicking a drowning
but nobody steps in.

1206
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:49,930
- We don't realize how
quickly these kind of things

1207
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:52,180
can go from just a fun pool party

1208
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:54,270
to an incident where someone needs help.

1209
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:56,010
- So now, the kids are
gonna get out of the water.

1210
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:57,610
They're gonna go get some snacks

1211
00:47:57,610 --> 00:47:58,950
and they're gonna leave someone behind

1212
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:01,820
and that person is gonna start drowning.

1213
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:04,280
After 30 seconds of purposeful struggling,

1214
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:05,627
this dad spots her.

1215
00:48:06,643 --> 00:48:08,128
- You all right?

1216
00:48:08,128 --> 00:48:09,140
Huh?

1217
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:11,150
- Within 36 seconds, he noticed.

1218
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:13,040
- It's great that he noticed.

1219
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,020
We hope that they would notice faster.

1220
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:17,480
- He says in some cases,
swimmers can submerge in

1221
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:20,800
just seconds making them
even more difficult to spot.

1222
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,663
It's time to reveal our experiment.

1223
00:48:22,663 --> 00:48:23,496
Someone was drowning.

1224
00:48:23,496 --> 00:48:25,980
There were four drownings
that nobody spotted.

1225
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:26,960
What's that make you think?

1226
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,780
- My kids are on the
deck so I turned my back.

1227
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:32,100
Doesn't mean there weren't
other kids in the pool though.

1228
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:34,650
- I got thrown off by the age.

1229
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:35,880
So I think we took for granted

1230
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,610
that they all knew how to swim.

1231
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:39,530
- For the man who spotted our victim,

1232
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:41,170
it's too close to reality.

1233
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:43,450
You were visibly shaking.
- Yeah.

1234
00:48:43,450 --> 00:48:45,690
- [Gio] Why were you so nervous?

1235
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:47,240
- It's,

1236
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,570
it did happen

1237
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:51,170
to my child.

1238
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:53,080
- [Gio] His daughter Valentina survived

1239
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:55,230
but he says when she was just three,

1240
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:58,500
she began drowning in a hot
tub, he was on the phone.

1241
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:01,740
- I got a phone call and

1242
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:04,880
I got distracted and she was in trouble.

1243
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,090
So, that brought memories.

1244
00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:09,550
- Water safety experts
say one of the solutions

1245
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:12,690
is a water watcher, somebody
standing next to the pool

1246
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:15,870
free from distractions,
constantly scanning the water

1247
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:17,860
for any signs of distress,

1248
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:21,500
rotating every 15 minutes
to avoid losing focus.

1249
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,480
We showed the parents what they missed.

1250
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:26,180
This is that moment when
she's motionless in the water

1251
00:49:27,716 --> 00:49:30,690
and this seems to be
very emotional for you.

1252
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:31,840
- They're all our kids.

1253
00:49:33,098 --> 00:49:34,313
What else do you say?

1254
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:38,280

00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:37,750
two divisions competed in the
Palisades Pie Eating Contest.

1417
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:40,390
There was a kids challenge
and then one for the adults.

1418
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:41,880
It's so much cuter with the kids.

1419
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:46,880
The twist is that this was
obviously hands free there.

1420
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,090
Goodness.
- Wow, what a mess.

1421
00:56:49,090 --> 00:56:51,085
But a lot of fun.
- Wow.

1422
00:56:51,085 --> 00:56:52,890
- I think I can do better if
it was like chocolate cream

1423
00:56:52,890 --> 00:56:55,180
or coconut cream as
opposed to a fruit pie.

1424
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:58,110
- I feel like the cherries
are easier to, you know.

1425
00:56:58,110 --> 00:56:59,100
- It's a mess

1426
00:56:59,100 --> 00:56:59,933
but a lot of fun.
- I don't know.

1427
00:56:59,933 --> 00:57:02,360
- All right so here we go
through the afternoon hours.

1428
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:04,150
We are live now, almost one o'clock.

1429
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:07,690
We have a Flash Flood Watch
that will go into effect

1430
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:10,030
in about four minutes until
eight o'clock tonight.

1431
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:11,680
Areas that are shaded in green.

1432
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,840
Here's our FutureCast, two o'clock.

1433
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:18,060
Notice East of D.C, heaviest
the downpours are on the way

1434
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:19,910
and as we move through
the three o'clock hour,

1435
00:57:19,910 --> 00:57:23,080
the four o'clock hour, this
is our high resolution model.

1436
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:26,000
It does keep the heaviest of the rain

1437
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,130
at least according to this
model outside of the Beltway

1438
00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:33,670
however this could shift a
few miles and around here,

1439
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:37,152
three, four, five, six miles
makes a big difference.

1440
00:57:37,152 --> 00:57:40,090
As we move into the seven
o'clock hour, eight o'clock hour,

1441
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:42,440
things begin to improve for the fireworks.

1442
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,060
So your 4th of July afternoon

1443
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:46,650
and evening forecast looks like this.

1444
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:48,490
It is hot, it is humid.

1445
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:52,080
Temperatures well into the
upper 80s to near 90 to start.

1446
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:55,260
Heavier downpours could bring
upwards of two inches of rain.

1447
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:57,360
Localized flooding, even some

1448
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,510
thunderstorms with gusty winds.

1449
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:00,480

comfort of its more expensive

cousins, it's really a
little gem of a mattress.

1476

That's when I found MarketPro Home Buyers.
