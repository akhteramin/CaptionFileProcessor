1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,220
- [Reporter] That his brother's gambling

2
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:03,200
had placed his family in danger.

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,670
- [Reporter] Was it revenge
or was his graphic novel

4
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,040
a script for murder.

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,093
- It's just more like a horror movie.

6
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,681
- [Announcer] CBS News,
Original Reporting.

7
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:17,264
(upbeat music)

8
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:26,150
- [Announcer] Do you feel
the need to keep climbing,

9
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,800
even when you've reached the top?

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,000
Do you appreciate everything you have,

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,393
but still wanna do more?

12
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:37,363
You do when you're free.

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,550
Set yourself free in a Jeep Grand Cherokee

14
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,080
at the Jeep Fourth of July Sales Event.

15
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,060
Finance and get 4,250 total cash allowance

16
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,673
on select 2019 Jeep Grand
Cherokee models in dealer stock.

17
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,310
- [Zo] Right now at 11:00

18
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,130
heavy rain and strong winds

19
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:03,270
across the Washington area
tonight knocking down trees

20
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,000
and knocking out power.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,773
These storms were
intense so let's find out

22
00:01:07,773 --> 00:01:08,606
if we're in the clear.

23
00:01:08,606 --> 00:01:10,430
Meteorologist, Melissa
Nord, is here with me now

24
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,460
and, Melissa, I have a
feeling the answer is no.

25
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,420
- Well, you're guessing right.

26
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,950
Mother Nature's storm
game is still going strong

27
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,660
at 11 o'clock tonight.

28
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,170
You can see the progression of the storms

29
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:23,340
over the last five hours
and just in the last hour

30
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,100
tracking another intense thunderstorm

31
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,750
that's over Southern Maryland,

32
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,120
stretching through Charles County

33
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,870
and now moving into St.
Mary's County, Mechanicsville,

34
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:35,680
with a lot of heavy rain and
about 20 lightening strikes

35
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,520
in the last 10 minutes alone.

36
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,940
So this is our one last
storm of the night.

37
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,780
Moving towards Lexington Park, 11:36

38
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,410
and if it holds together,

39
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,950
Ridge, Maryland by about midnight tonight.

40
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,530
Now tomorrow we have
another round of storms

41
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:49,760
so let's talk about storm threats.

42
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,600
Now tomorrow I think the
greater overall threat

43
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,100
is gonna end up being
just some very heavy rain

44
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,960
falling on saturated ground
that could lead to flooding.

45
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,100
We're gonna see lightening

46
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,530
and I think we could also
see an isolated storm

47
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,303
become strong or severe,

48
00:02:03,303 --> 00:02:05,290
maybe not as many as we saw today,

49
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,300
but the storms tomorrow
will still be intense.

50
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,740
We'll start the morning with patchy fog.

51
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,550
Let' take Futurecast out to noon.

52
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,680
You're still noticing we're
mostly dry on Futurecast,

53
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,290
but starting in the afternoon
that next round of storms

54
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,210
starts firing up and,
Zo, once it starts going

55
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,730
it's gonna get only
more intense from there.

56
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:24,580
We'll take you through the
rest of the Futurecast.

57
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,370
We're gonna look ahead into
when we'll see our next streak

58
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,180
of dry days next.

59
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,180
- [Zo] That's what I wanna hear.

60
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,180
All right, thank you Melissa.

61
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,510
And this should come as no surprise,

62
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,230
the storms left behind a lot
of damage in our area tonight.

63
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,670
Check out this huge tree

64
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,170
that may have brushed against this house

65
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,500
along Reservoir Road in Northwest D.C.

66
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,810
right before falling over.

67
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:46,260
There's no word of any injuries tonight.

68
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,260
And in Glover Park more damage.

69
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,010
This tree snapped and fell
right onto that parked SUV.

70
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,250
Some of those other cars nearby

71
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,240
may have been damaged as well.

72
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,100
And check this out, also in the district

73
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,590
yet another tree crashes onto a car.

74
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,950
You can't even really see the car

75
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,900
because that tree is so big there.

76
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,480
This happened along Upshur Street

77
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,370
and New Hampshire Avenue.

78
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,120
And here's a look at more weather pictures

79
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,490
coming in tonight from our WUSA9 team

80
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,720
throughout the region.

81
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,620
These are just spectacular.

82
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,420
Look at this, because of the
intensity of this storm again

83
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,650
which you can gauge
from these images alone,

84
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,510
many people are without power tonight

85
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,610
especially in Prince George's County,

86
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,620
hundreds of people there without power.

87
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,970
Well, if you have pictures or video

88
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:28,000
you'd like to send our way you can tag us,

89
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,540
WUSA9 on Facebook or Twitter
and we'll share them here.

90
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,020
Well, before the storms rolled in tonight

91
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,490
police responded to a
deadly motorcycle crash

92
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:37,710
in Montgomery County.

93
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:40,440
This happened in
Gaithersburg just off of 270

94
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,000
at the intersection of 370 and Route 200.

95
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,400
Police tell us a 45-year-old
man crashed there tonight.

96
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,233
Well, it has certainly been

97
00:03:48,233 --> 00:03:50,320
a tense day and night in Washington.

98
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,130
Right and left wing protestors,

99
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,180
they faced off near the White House today.

100
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,050
One side demanding free speech,

101
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:58,300
the other, speech free of hate.

102
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,072
Here's Jess Arnold.

103
00:04:00,072 --> 00:04:02,157
- [Protestors] Build that wall.

104
00:04:02,157 --> 00:04:03,800
- [Protestors] Black Lives Matter.

105
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,960
- [Jess] Right wing ralliers,

106
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,440
and counter protestors in
downtown D.C. Saturday.

107
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,620
- My biggest issue is the fact

108
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,480
that Trump is trying to divide people.

109
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,681
- I respect your conviction.

110
00:04:14,681 --> 00:04:15,514
- [Man] Yes.

111
00:04:15,514 --> 00:04:16,660
(background talking)

112
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,160
- [Jess] From MAGA-hat wearers

113
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,520
to the Neo-fascist group, Proud Boys,

114
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,970
the right rally to defend free speech

115
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,190
after they say sites
like Twitter and Facebook

116
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,330
censored some of them.

117
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,900
- [Woman] Will they take
away our right to Tweet,

118
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,710
take away our right to share photos,

119
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:33,350
take away our right to
share our peace of mind.

120
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:36,127
They take away our right to
do rallies like this, so.

121
00:04:36,127 --> 00:04:38,010
- [Jess] Across the street groups like,

122
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,670
Black Lives Matter, Sanctuary DMV,

123
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:43,000
and other activists
joined under the banner,

124
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,470
AllOUTDC, to protest
hate in Pershing Park.

125
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,980
- We're over here showing that, you know,

126
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,670
even in the face of
white supremacy and hate

127
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,650
that we still are working
towards liberation.

128
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,630
- [Jess] Some clashes were inevitable.

129
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,947
- Do not touch me.

130
00:04:58,942 --> 00:05:00,423
- Abraham Lincoln (mic
not picking up voice).

131
00:05:00,423 --> 00:05:01,328
- It's not the party of

132
00:05:01,328 --> 00:05:03,596
Abraham Lincoln anymore.
- Yes it is.

133
00:05:03,596 --> 00:05:05,040
It is the party of (mumbles).

134
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,730
- These big tech companies they lie

135
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:10,410
and they call us Nazi's,
they call us terrible people,

136
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,590
they say all conservatives
are evil and racist.

137
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,290
To these Antifa people over there

138
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,900
have the complete wrong idea.

139
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,110
These Antifa people should be on our side.

140
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,360
If they're against fascism

141
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,530
they should be against censoring voices.

142
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,670
- [Jess] Those for and
against the President

143
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,075
had no problem raising
their voices Saturday.

144
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,530
- I support Donald Trump because of

145
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:31,500
the urban revitalization,
tax cuts, prison reform,

146
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,640
second-chance hiring,

147
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,020
that helps a black community a lot.

148
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,770
- I'm really ashamed
of a lot of the things

149
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,010
that are going on in the country

150
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,600
and I think it's really important

151
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,338
for everybody to speak out.

152
00:05:41,338 --> 00:05:42,184
- [Man] Our street.

153
00:05:42,184 --> 00:05:43,070
- [Together] Our street.

154
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,273
- [Jess] Jess Arnold, WUSA9.

155
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,760
- [Zo] Also tonight, still can't get over

156
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,810
these pictures right here.

157
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,740
Crews, they finally
removed that red minivan

158
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,320
that was swallowed up by
this massive sink hole

159
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,190
in Northern Virginia earlier this week.

160
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,900
This took place along Princedale Drive

161
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,950
in Woodbridge on the Fourth of July.

162
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,930
Thankfully that was just parked

163
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,670
and no one was inside at the time.

164
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,180
The Virginia Department of Transportation

165
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,640
is blaming a stormwater pipe that burst

166
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,090
because of all the rain
we've been getting lately.

167
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,990
While the van is now out VDOT says

168
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,540
it will take weeks to repair

169
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,900
this section of Princedale Drive

170
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,400
so it will remain closed.

171
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,640
And new details tonight
on a single-car crash

172
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,160
that shut down parts of I-95

173
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,020
in Spotsylvania County yesterday.

174
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,290
Some of you may have
been caught up in this

175
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,600
at the end of the workday.

176
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,520
We're now told a 2004 Ford Explorer

177
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,360
was traveling north on I-95

178
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,480
when the driver ran off the right shoulder

179
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,570
and overturned several times

180
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,630
before coming to a rest
on the left shoulder.

181
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,210
The driver, 24-year-old,
Jahvante Winnagle,

182
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,780
from West Virginia, was
taken to a nearby hospital

183
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,950
with life-threatening injuries,

184
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:45,810
but the news is more grim
for some of his passengers.

185
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:49,200
A passenger in that Ford,
47-year-old, Frederick Thomas,

186
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,790
was ejected and died at the scene.

187
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,550
Thomas was not wearing a seatbelt.

188
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:56,640
Another passenger, Robert
Rutherford, was also killed.

189
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,930
Now two other passengers
in that car with them

190
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:01,280
were transported to
Mary Washington Hospital

191
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,590
with minor injuries.

192
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:06,190
Both of those passengers
were wearing seat belts.

193
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,640
A suspected gas explosion in Florida today

194
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,360
reduced parts of a
shopping mall to rubble.

195
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,150
That blast was massive.

196
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,360
At least 21 people were hurt.

197
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,170
This happened in Plantation, Florida

198
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,670
west of Fort Lauderdale.

199
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,490
Here's, Peter King.

200
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:21,670
- [Peter] The blast originated

201
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:24,610
inside a vacant pizza
restaurant destroying it

202
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,230
and sending debris flying
across this shopping center

203
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,680
in Plantation, Florida.

204
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,800
Falling debris crushed several
cars in the parking lot.

205
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,480
- I heard a loud, boom, and really thought

206
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,580
it was fireworks.

207
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,530
- [Peter] The force of the
blast shattered windows

208
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:40,350
and damaged businesses in
the same section of the plaza

209
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,280
including an L.A. Fitness Center.

210
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,210
People inside the gym said
the entire building shook.

211
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,510
It's roof collapsed,

212
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:49,150
patrons were sent scrambling to get out.

213
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,699
- My first initial instinct was,

214
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:51,840
was this an earthquake, but I was like,

215
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,110
I'm in Florida so obviously
it's not an earthquake.

216
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,270
I was just terrified honestly.

217
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,000
- [Peter] The explosion
was powerful enough

218
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,230
to be felt for miles around.

219
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,350
- When we arrived we
found patients scattered

220
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,970
all about the debris area.

221
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:06,220
- [Peter] First responders
set up a triage area

222
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,570
and firefighters with
specially trained dogs

223
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:09,890
searched the area to make sure

224
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,930
no one was trapped or killed.

225
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:14,520
Fire officials say everyone
has been accounted for.

226
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,930
- We're very much relieved,

227
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,300
that considering the debris field,

228
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,900
and considering how we found the patients

229
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,733
and where we found 'em,

230
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,920
that the injuries are not as severe

231
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,410
as we would have thought they would be.

232
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,150
So we're very thankful for that.

233
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:27,653
- [Peter] Peter King, CBS News, Orlando.

234
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,250
- [Zo] President Trump doubling down

235
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,120
on his fight to add a
controversial question

236
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,730
about citizenship to the 2020 census.

237
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:37,030
Nicole Killian is traveling
with the President tonight

238
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,900
and she's in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey.

239
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,670
- [Nicole] President
Trump flew to New Jersey

240
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:44,550
for his first summer
visit to his country club.

241
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,740
While back in Washington aides scrambled

242
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,040
to find a way to get
a citizenship question

243
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,240
included in the 2020 census

244
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,780
despite pushback from the Supreme Court.

245
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,650
- We have four or five ways we could do it

246
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:56,997
so we're working on a lot of things

247
00:08:56,997 --> 00:08:59,540
including an executive order.

248
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,620
- [Nicole] A source familiar
with the deliberations

249
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,100
tells CBS News attorneys are
reviewing all the options

250
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,010
and are trying to resolve the legal issues

251
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,620
as quickly as possible.

252
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,030
(background chanting)

253
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:12,110
Critics charge the citizenship question

254
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,890
discriminates against immigrants

255
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,520
and communities of color.

256
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,740
- We're gonna lose a lot of support

257
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:21,060
for the, our communities in our regions.

258
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,460
Experts say the President can't override

259
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:26,070
the Supreme Courts decision
to block the question,

260
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,370
but he can come up with a new rationale

261
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:29,950
for why it's warranted.

262
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,880
- The Commerce Secretary
can add some questions

263
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,690
to the census if there are
valid reasons to do so.

264
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:37,580
- [Nicole] The President also
wants action on immigration.

265
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,750
After postponing mass
deportation roundups last month

266
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,680
he's threatening they'll
start fairly soon.

267
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,820
- I don't call 'em raids,

268
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,040
I say they came in illegally

269
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,800
and we're bringing 'em out legally.

270
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,320
- [Nicole] The administration continues

271
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,530
to come under fire for poor conditions

272
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:56,410
at migrant detention centers
along the Southern border.

273
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:58,770
- President Trump claims
the facilities are clean

274
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,430
and run beautifully, but a
government watch dog report

275
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:04,020
described the crisis
as a ticking time bomb.

276
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,040
House Democrats plan a hearing next week.

277
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,383
Nicole Killian, CBS News,

cooked up for a good cause.

282
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:23,610

283

- Do I look like I'm joking?

323
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,310
- Yes, you look like you're joking.

324
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,680
- I'm serious.

325
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,513
- Cool.

326
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:28,090
- [Together] Get Bob's Discount.

327
00:12:31,653 --> 00:12:33,450
- Aw man, this is what
people are dealing with

328
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:34,300
out West tonight.

329
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,380
We are learning about a strong earthquake

330
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,050
that jolted the Los
Angeles area last night

331
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,390
just a day after a slightly weaker one

332
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,020
rattled Southern California.

333
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,730
The magnitude 7.1 earthquake's epicenter

334
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:48,140
is near Ridgecrest where a rock slide

335
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,570
has shut down a road.

336
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,610
It also triggered a number of fires.

337
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,393
Here's, Joy Benedict, in Pasadena.

338
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:57,270
- [Joy] The magnitude 7.1 earthquake

339
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:00,700
hit just one day after Thursdays 6.4 jolt.

340
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,570
- There were a number of structure fires,

341
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:05,220
there were gas leaks,
there was road damage,

342
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,310
rock slides.

343
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:08,950
- [Joy] This was the scene
inside a market in Ridgecrest,

344
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:11,070
the city near the epicenter of the quakes.

345
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,690
Food and other items flew off the shelves.

346
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:14,860
- This is a very strong earthquake.

347
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,680
- [Joy] About 150 miles to the Southwest

348
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,760
our CBS colleagues in Los Angeles

349
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,470
felt the earthquake Friday night

350
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:22,920
while they were broadcasting.

351
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,753
- We'll be right back.
- Wow.

352
00:13:23,753 --> 00:13:25,280
- [Joy] And at the Dodgers home game.

353
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,230
- Suddenly like something started shaking

354
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:29,680
and we're like looking
around and all of a sudden

355
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,780
everyone's like, whoa.

356
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:34,490
- [Joy] But the baseball game continued.

357
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,430
The earthquake even rattled Los Vegas

358
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:39,420
with enough force to stop this NBA game.

359
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,060
Thousands of earthquakes have
struck Southern California

360
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,770
here in the last couple of days

361
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:47,220
so scientists here at Cal
Tech are crunching the numbers

362
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,640
trying to figure out
the probability of more.

363
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,250
- We're concerned about future aftershocks

364
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,160
and where they're gonna be.

365
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,700
- [Joy] Seismologists say the likelihood

366
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,250
of another magnitude six
quake over the next week

367
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,660
is more than 25%.

368
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:03,880
Joy Benedict, CBS News,
Pasadena, California.

369
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,730
- And Governor Gavin Newsom

370
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:05,960
declared a state of emergency

371
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,730
for a section of Southern California

372
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,470
that saw significant damage

373
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,690
after Friday night's earthquake.

374
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,870
All right I wanna bring in
meteorologist, Melissa Nord,

375
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,030
again with us tonight

376
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,480
because it's been a busy night

377
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,360
storm wise--
- Yep.

378
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,960
- And it's still not over.

379
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,620
- It's not over quite yet.
- Okay.

380
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,730
- We've got one storm
that is left out there,

381
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:23,563
but we get--
- Just one.

382
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:24,396
- To do it all

383
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:26,420
again tomorrow.
- Rinse and repeat, right?

384
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,180
- As if you were not done with it already.

385
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,910
Here we go, look at the tower cam,

386
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:33,870
nice and dry over D.C. right now.

387
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,750
I don't remember if I mentioned
this a couple minutes ago,

388
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,820
our wind gusts at Reagan National,

389
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,500
as the storms were coming through,

390
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,120
was just about 40 miles an hour,

391
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,250
but at the Capitol it gusted to 66.

392
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,330
That's why there's
dozens, I'm not kidding,

393
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:48,973
66 at the U.S. Capitol.

394
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,560
It's not, but in terms
of a, it can happen,

395
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,578
we'll just leave it there.

396
00:14:56,578 --> 00:14:59,030
There were dozens of
trees down all over D.C.

397
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,440
At one point we had about
5,000 people without power

398
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,810
in Bladen County, 4,000
people without power

399
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:04,810
in Prince George's County,

400
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:07,420
hopefully all of your power
is restored at this point.

401
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,360
But let me show you the
last remaining storm

402
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,230
with still a lot of lightening

403
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,240
over Southern Charles
County and now really

404
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,370
into St. Mary's County.

405
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,910
I put a lightening tracker on this

406
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,700
and for 11 o'clock at night

407
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,470
this storm is holding together pretty well

408
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,190
with heavy rain right over Mechanicsville

409
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,620
moving into Leonardtown.

410
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:28,190
About 45 lightening strikes
in the last 10 minutes alone.

411
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,020
Here's the setup though.

412
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,110
We've got this front that
is trying to move through,

413
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:36,870
but it is gonna stall out
over the area tomorrow.

414
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,730
That front is the dividing line between

415
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,350
this disgustingly humid
air mass we've been in

416
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:45,050
and, well, not exactly
Canadian pleasantry,

417
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:47,260
but it'll be a little drop in the humidity

418
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,380
a little more manageable
levels outside by Tuesday.

419
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:53,560
But we're in that transition
period for Sunday and Monday

420
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,020
with still some storm chances.

421
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,730
So I pulled up here a
different weather model

422
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:00,150
showing you over the next 48
hours alone, look at this.

423
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:03,860
I mean, we've got our
in-house RPM model showing

424
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:07,230
we could get another 3 1/2
inches in some isolated spots.

425
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,810
So what this is showing me is

426
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:12,120
we have a heavy rainfall
threat setting up for tomorrow.

427
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,890
Tomorrow's storms could bring
some locally heavy rain.

428
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,270
That is my biggest concern

429
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,950
out of all of our storm threats.

430
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,100
Yes, I think we could see

431
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,280
an isolated strong severe storm tomorrow,

432
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,430
like we saw today, but not
quite as many strong storms

433
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,880
with some damaging winds.

434
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,800
But I think the overall
greater threat for tomorrow

435
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,620
is gonna be some downpours
falling on saturated ground

436
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,630
and that could lead to flooding.

437
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:34,760
We're also gonna see lightening.

438
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,180
So if you're gonna be
boating, at the pool,

439
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:40,530
just hiking outside
tomorrow, or enjoying brunch,

440
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,308
heads up, there will be some storms.

441
00:16:42,308 --> 00:16:43,750
You don't wanna be
caught outside with them.

442
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,420
Okay, Futurecast hour-by-hour.

443
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,300
Now after today's storms I
do think we're going to see

444
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,570
some fog forming
overnight, some of that fog

445
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:51,690
could be locally dense.

446
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,300
So we'll start the
morning with cloud cover

447
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,760
with some patchy fog, temps in the 70s.

448
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,590
By lunchtime still a bit of cloud cover,

449
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,423
but we're starting to see

450
00:16:58,423 --> 00:17:01,740
that cloud cover breaking
up a bit, temps in the 80s.

451
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,270
We head into 3:00 in the afternoon

452
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,510
and here's where we start to see

453
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,510
those scattered storms developing

454
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,790
and I think our storm timeframe tomorrow

455
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:11,350
is a little bit later than it was today.

456
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:13,690
Storms will start around mid afternoon,

457
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:14,830
they'll really ramp up

458
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:17,880
as we head past dinnertime in the evening.

459
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,330
Lots of my computer models

460
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,810
are trying to keep storms in the forecast

461
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:25,650
throughout Sunday night and
even in to Monday morning,

462
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:28,500
but with a lot of heavy
storms that keep bringing

463
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,560
rounds of heavy rain over the area,

464
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,240
that's why I think
tomorrow's gonna be flooding

465
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,080
a bigger threat locally,
especially street flooding

466
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,960
and creek and stream levels rising.

467
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,840
So tomorrow we start with that patchy fog,

468
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,460
a mostly dry start to the day,

469
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,170
but it's later in the
day we start to bring

470
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,520
those storm chances in.

471
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,940
I've got highs that are
running in the mid 80s.

472
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,250
All right, Nats forecast for tomorrow.

473
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,460
They're playing Kansas City
Royals, 1:35 first pitch.

474
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,060
You know I think we're
gonna get pretty lucky

475
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,120
at the beginning of things,

476
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,660
but by the end of the game we'll track

477
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,510
some of those wildly scattered storms

478
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:01,270
so by the finish of the
game, yeah, it's possible,

479
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,970
there could be a rain delay.

480
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:05,520
But I think a, cross your fingers,

481
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,980
1:35 looks like a better
start time tomorrow

482
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,710
than having something
middle of the afternoon.

483
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,110
All right, so tomorrow,

484
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:14,930
here's our showers and thunderstorms.

485
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,900
We'll go into Monday and that front

486
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,090
is still close enough to us

487
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:21,900
to where it leaves us
with some storm chances,

488
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,640
but as we get into Tuesday and Wednesday

489
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,830
that high pressure
completely dries us out,

490
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,780
it brings in a slightly lower humidity.

491
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,660
So overall our forecast becomes

492
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,260
a lot more manageable outside

493
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,320
in terms of humidity and storm chances

494
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,670
Tuesday and Wednesday into this week.

495
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:40,150
By the way, Tracking
the Tropics, this week.

496
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,683
20% chance we could have a system develop.

497
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,680
It's actually an upper level trough

498
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,550
which is over Western Tennessee,

499
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,500
but it's gonna move out to the Gulf

500
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,200
and this is the area we're gonna watch

501
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,050
for some heavy rainfall
set up shop into this week.

502
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,320
So if you're taking a vacation out towards

503
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,920
PCB, Panama City Beach, Pensacola,

504
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,380
even over to New Orleans,

505
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,170
that's what I'm tracking
this week in the tropics.

506
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,070
All right I lowered the
high temp tomorrow to 88.

507
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,900
I think a bit of cloud
cover, fog, in the morning

508
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,080
is gonna limit how high we get,

509
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,670
but it's humid with some
thunderstorms late in the day

510
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,550
and into tomorrow night.

511
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:16,870
A few more storms Monday,
dry Tuesday, dry Wednesday.

512
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:19,260
We'll bring back some
storm chances Thursday

513
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:22,480
and lower humidity returns on Friday, Zo.

514
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,600
- All right, thank you Melissa.

515
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,210
Well, if you have an appetite for burgers

516
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:28,570
the place to be this holiday
weekend is Wisconsin.

517
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:30,020
I know you're not gonna
like me after this,

518
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,750
going to bed, not thinking about food,

519
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,250
and then I show you this juiciness.

520
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,760
The chef's at Riverfest are offering up

521
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,990
some of of the tastiest
burgers anywhere, so they say.

522
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:40,090
It's the fourth annual
Burger Bash, and get this,

523
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:42,010
for 10 bucks people can sample burgers

524
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:45,730
from competing chefs in
Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Iowa,

525
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:48,390
and then vote for who should
win the People's Choice Award

526
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,060
and a $300 reward.

527
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,950
Member's of local
organizations, and chefs,

528
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,430
they made up a panel of judges

529
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,197
that decided the best burger..

530
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,050
- This is definitely a competition.

531
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:59,490
Our chefs take this seriously,

532
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,000
our judges take this seriously.

533
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,050
When the community comes in

534
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,560
and they give their input

535
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,740
the chefs really like to
know what people think

536
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,503
of their, of their recipes.

537
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:09,350
- [Zo] I love seeing the people behind her

538
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,310
they look so happy.

539
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,830
Proceeds from the event will go to the,

540
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,820
Beer By Bike Brigade's fundraiser

541
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,700
to pay down school lunch debt for kids.

542
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,930
All right, coming up
next the NBA finals' MVP

543
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:21,623
is moving on, what's
next for Kawhi Leonard.

544
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,100
Plus a unique obstacle
course featuring couples

545
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,670
racing for a world championship.

546
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,420
We'll tell you about this one next.

547
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,343
- Don't I got rights?

548
00:20:34,343 --> 00:20:35,800
I said I don't consent to search.

549
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,310
- This stop led to a complaint

550
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,780
against D.C. police.

551
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:42,260
Last year there were 780
of them, a new record,

552
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,770
but some in the department say,

553
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:45,750
it's not the officer's fault.

554
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,520
Who's policing the police?

555
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,653
Tuesday at 11:00.

556

using her phone, also using

572
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,880

- All right, take a close
look at this right here.

620
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,990
All the Nationals the
uniforms they wore today,

621
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:33,360
there was a powder-blue
kind of jersey there,

622
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,470
and the pants that the Montreal Expos wore

623
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:38,220
through their inaugural
season 50 years ago.

624
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,570
It's the first time the
Nats wore these Expos,

625
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:42,470
throw-back uniforms, if you will.

626
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:43,433
As for the game.

627
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,530
- [Announcer] Kurt Suzuki, deep to left,

628
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:50,423

629
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:52,773

What a great combination to a long at-bat,

631
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,483
three-nothing, Nats.

632
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:02,250
- See, you, later, no, no.

633
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,360
Melissa was supposed to
join in with me on that one,

634
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,193
left me hanging.

635
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:07,190
All right that two-run
blast was more than enough.

636
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,830
Support from Max Scherzer who picked up

637
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,440
his ninth win of the season.

638
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,150
The Nats shut out Kansas
City six to nothing.

639
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:16,130
And Nationals' third
baseman, Anthony Rendon,

640
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:18,280
will not play in the All-Star game.

641
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,980
He says he's dealing
with some minor ailments

642
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,510
and he needs a little
time to rest and heal.

643
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,690
We wish him well.

644
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:25,560
All right, the Orioles
are in Canada this weekend

645
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,560
to wrap up the first half of the season.

646
00:24:28,514 --> 00:24:30,100
- [Announcer] And delivered,
boy did he get that one,

647
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:33,193
way back left field and it is, gone.

648
00:24:34,837 --> 00:24:37,979
Goodbye home run it stayed.

649
00:24:37,979 --> 00:24:40,260
So the Orioles slide to that foul pole.

650
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,870
And Nunez cranks one.

651
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:46,780
A couple of RBI's and a
two-nothing lead for the Orioles.

652
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,020
- Yeah, and that two-run blast

653
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,440
was part of a five-run, fourth,

654
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,300
that helped Baltimore beat
the Blue Jays, eight to one.

655
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,580
The Birds have now won
three in a row, keep going.

656
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,860
All right and we are just hearing tonight

657
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,650
that the Washington Wizards
have acquired forward,

658
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:01,280
Davis Bertans, from San Antonio,

659
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,050
in a three-team deal with
the Spurs and the Nets.

660
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:06,220
The Wizards sent the
draft rights of forward,

661
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,350
Aaron White, to Brooklyn

662
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:11,060
and the Spurs acquired,
DeMarre Carroll from Brooklyn.

663
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,150
All right, well dramatic changes

664
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,610
to the landscape of the NBA.

665
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:16,870
The Los Angeles Clippers
reportedly made two big moves.

666
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:19,020
They're signing free agent, Kawhi Leonard,

667
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:23,280
to a four-year, 142
million dollar contract.

668
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,510
While completing a trade

669
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,810
with the Oklahoma City
Thunder for Paul George.

670
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:29,850
Leonard becomes the first
player ever to switch teams

671
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:32,520
right after winning the finals MVP.

672
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,090
Getting paid nicely too.

673
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:35,610
And, you know, maybe they just needed

674
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:36,790
some time to cool off a bit,

675
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,520
but they probably didn't wanna be blasted

676
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,050
with sprinklers like this.

677
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:42,060
A mixed-doubles match at Wimbledon

678
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:44,390
was interrupted when a
sprinkler just went off,

679
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:46,620
blasting those players who
were sitting on the bench

680
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,770
during the change-over.

681
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:51,550
Yeah, not fun at all, right?

682
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,920
Of course they're quick too.

683
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,250
All right, and they're off in this case.

684
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:56,300
A blast of a traditional firework

685
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,750
kicked off, Pamplona, Spain,

686
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,300
Running of the Bulls Festival

687
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,520
opening nine days of
uninterrupted partying.

688
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,410
How 'bout that?

689
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:05,590
A member of the Northern
city's official brass band

690
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,423
was chosen this year

691
00:26:06,423 --> 00:26:08,210
for Saturday's launch of the rocket,

692
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:10,050
known as the Chupinazo,

693
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:13,730
to mark 100 years since the
local ensemble's foundation.

694
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:14,910
You can see revelers there,

695
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:16,570
they're dressed in their white attire,

696
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:18,750
flaunting those traditional red scarves,

697
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:21,030
who just spray each other with wine.

698
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,490
They'd have a good time too.

699
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,000
American novelist, Ernest Hemingway,

700
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,330
immortalized the fiesta that each year

701
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:29,370
draws around 100, or one million visitors

702
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:31,800
for eight consecutive
mornings starting Sunday.

703
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,710
These dare devils they race with the bulls

704
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:36,479
along a 930 yard street course

705
00:26:36,479 --> 00:26:37,753
to the city's bullring.

706
00:26:37,753 --> 00:26:38,743
(crowd cheering and hollering)

707
00:26:38,743 --> 00:26:39,912
Uh, never.

708
00:26:39,912 --> 00:26:41,656
All right, now another kind of race here.

709
00:26:41,656 --> 00:26:43,310
A Lithuanian man and his wife

710
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:47,700
they've won the world's
Wife-Carrying title, okay,

711
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,790
leaping over timber, wading
through waist-high water

712
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:52,330
to beat dozens of other couples

713
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:54,190
for a second year running.

714
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:58,700
The couple cleared a grueling
278-yard obstacle course

715
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,770
in one minute 6.72 seconds.

716
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:03,460
That was just a tenth of a second ahead of

717
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:06,100
the former six-time world
champion and his partner.

718
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,780
Couples from over a dozen countries,

719
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:10,430
they take part in this
annual race in Finland

720
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,510
and prizes were issued

721
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:14,080
to the first three couples
to cross the finish line,

722
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,930
as well as the most entertaining couple,

723
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:19,400
best costume, and the strongest carrier.

724
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,330
Can you get over this video, this is wild,

725

wild stuff right here.

726
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,040
Well, despite the event's name

727
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,650
couples do not have to be married.

728
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:30,200
Relationship-building exercise right here.

729
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,870
All right, still ahead,
heavy rain tonight.

730
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:34,490
What can we expect Sunday and
heading into your work week.

731
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:36,690

- Fall, no, now you're taking it too far.

830

We want summer--
- I know.

831
00:30:57,895 --> 00:30:58,728
- But, you know just not

832
00:30:58,728 --> 00:30:59,561
these storms.
- I know, people are

833
00:30:59,561 --> 00:31:00,394

and storms late tomorrow.

839

Some of them could bring
some very heavy rainfall.

Isolated strong severe storm.

841
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:16,010

carry into Sunday night.

You know what though, I
know it sucks for Nats fans,

850

like when there's rain delays,

851
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:40,103
but next Friday's game
actually looks really good.

852
00:31:40,103 --> 00:31:41,700
- Good, okay, okay.
- Yeah.

853
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,127
