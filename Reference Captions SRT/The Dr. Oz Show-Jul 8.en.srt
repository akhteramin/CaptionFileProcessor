- [Narrator] Fast, easy.

21
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:51,970
- When it comes to frozen food,
breakfast foods are queen.

22
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:54,195
- [Narrator] But are
they really good for you?

23
00:00:54,195 --> 00:00:55,877
- Or are they just junk food in disguise?

24
00:00:55,877 --> 00:00:57,864
- [Narrator] Plus, fat shamers.

25
00:00:57,864 --> 00:01:00,097
- [Woman] I can't sit here
because they're both so big.

26
00:01:00,097 --> 00:01:01,453
- [Narrator] Caught on tape.

27
00:01:01,453 --> 00:01:03,088
- [Man] She's eating too much chocolate.

28
00:01:03,088 --> 00:01:05,177
- [Woman] Why are you
insulting me about my weight?

29
00:01:05,177 --> 00:01:06,582
- [Narrator] Coming up next.

30
00:01:06,582 --> 00:01:09,249
(intense music)

31
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,804
(upbeat music)

32
00:01:12,804 --> 00:01:14,231
- Y'all ready for season 10?

33
00:01:14,231 --> 00:01:15,481

34
00:01:20,753 --> 00:01:23,040
- I love you, Dr. Oz.

35
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,957
(audience cheers and applause)

36
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:34,458
- Today, an investigation
into a giant shift

37
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:37,047
happening in your frozen food aisle.

38
00:01:37,047 --> 00:01:39,343
The food industry is
offering an unprecedented

39
00:01:39,343 --> 00:01:43,225
number of microwavable frozen
breakfast food options,

40
00:01:43,225 --> 00:01:46,027
including your favorites,
breakfast sandwiches,

41
00:01:46,027 --> 00:01:47,708
delicious looking omelet cups,

42
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:51,229
burritos and egg muffins,
all hot and ready in minutes.

43
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:54,835
Many even claim to be
healthier, but are they,

44
00:01:54,835 --> 00:01:57,065
or are they just junk food in disguise?

45
00:01:57,065 --> 00:01:59,736
Investigator and mom of
two, Mara Schiavocampo,

46
00:01:59,736 --> 00:02:01,571
put many of these options to the test

47
00:02:01,571 --> 00:02:05,854
in the best food lab there
is, her own busy kitchen.

48
00:02:05,854 --> 00:02:08,507
- Okay so, I'm shopping
for breakfast sandwiches.

49
00:02:08,507 --> 00:02:09,844
I can't remember the last time

50
00:02:09,844 --> 00:02:11,628
I bought a breakfast sandwich.

51
00:02:11,628 --> 00:02:13,967
So this should be interesting.

52
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,217
Hey quesadilla.

53
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:19,234
Do you wanna try these for breakfast?

54
00:02:19,234 --> 00:02:20,784
- Um, what are they?

55
00:02:20,784 --> 00:02:23,585
- [Mara] It's a breakfast
sandwich made on a waffle.

56
00:02:23,585 --> 00:02:25,386
It's bacon, egg, and cheese.

57
00:02:25,386 --> 00:02:27,445
- I don't really like eggs or cheese,

58
00:02:27,445 --> 00:02:29,520
but I could try with something else.

59
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,744
Maybe just bacon?

60
00:02:30,744 --> 00:02:32,677
- [Mara] So, this is
what I ended up getting.

61
00:02:32,677 --> 00:02:34,456
We have two different English muffins.

62
00:02:34,456 --> 00:02:35,495
They are different.

63
00:02:35,495 --> 00:02:39,067
This one is like on a waffle
and this is a breadless

64
00:02:39,067 --> 00:02:41,751
egg cup which I am very excited about.

65
00:02:41,751 --> 00:02:43,424
(audience applause)

66
00:02:43,424 --> 00:02:45,547
- Mara, be honest, was
that the best assignment

67
00:02:45,547 --> 00:02:47,251
you have ever been given?

68
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:49,872
- You know, any assignment
that involves tasting food,

69
00:02:49,872 --> 00:02:51,328
I'm in, sign me up for it.

70
00:02:51,328 --> 00:02:52,357
- [Dr. Oz] And your daughter's already an

71
00:02:52,357 --> 00:02:53,190
investigative reporter.

72
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,756
- She's very discerning, yeah.

73
00:02:54,756 --> 00:02:57,253
You know, breakfast is a
really hard meal for me.

74
00:02:57,253 --> 00:02:58,841
I was really happy to get this assignment

75
00:02:58,841 --> 00:03:00,298
because this is tough for me.

76
00:03:00,298 --> 00:03:01,723
I'm a low carb eater.

77
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,889
So I'm always looking for
portable, low carb options,

78
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:06,347
and with my kids, I'm
looking for alternatives

79
00:03:06,347 --> 00:03:08,237
to the staples that are high sugar,

80
00:03:08,237 --> 00:03:10,546
high carb, like cereal and pancakes.

81
00:03:10,546 --> 00:03:12,436
So this could change things in my house.

82
00:03:12,436 --> 00:03:14,406
- And how big have these
products become now,

83
00:03:14,406 --> 00:03:15,744
these microwavable breakfasts?

84
00:03:15,744 --> 00:03:17,495
- When it comes to frozen food,

85
00:03:17,495 --> 00:03:20,137
breakfast foods are doing so well.

86
00:03:20,137 --> 00:03:21,667
Really it's for two reasons.

87
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:23,167
One is millennials.

88
00:03:23,167 --> 00:03:26,187
So, 82% of millennials say that this

89
00:03:26,187 --> 00:03:28,830
is a good option for their
kids and case in point,

90
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,432
I agree with that completely.

91
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,797
The other one is the keto crowd.

92
00:03:32,797 --> 00:03:34,379
Keto is huge right now.

93
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:36,255
They're looking for low carb options.

94
00:03:36,255 --> 00:03:37,992
Those two things are
driving this industry.

95
00:03:37,992 --> 00:03:39,904
- Yeah, they use, the bun is actually egg.

96
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,925
- And it looks so delicious.

97
00:03:40,925 --> 00:03:42,018
- It does look good.

98
00:03:42,018 --> 00:03:42,890
All right, that's a start.

99
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,684
So we asked food scientist, Taylor,

100
00:03:44,684 --> 00:03:46,980
and he's a fanatic, by the
way, about breakfast foods.

101
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,699
Taylor Wallace to be here to break down

102
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:50,704
exactly how microwavable
breakfasts are made.

103
00:03:50,704 --> 00:03:53,066
Let's start with the prime
ingredient of all, the egg.

104
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,678
Is there a real egg in these
microwavable breakfasts?

105
00:03:55,678 --> 00:03:56,993
Crack the egg for me.

106
00:03:56,993 --> 00:03:58,307
- So actually, yes.

107
00:03:58,307 --> 00:04:02,074
Many of these products, the
main ingredient is a whole egg.

108
00:04:02,074 --> 00:04:04,712
Now, also in these
products, you're gonna see

109
00:04:04,712 --> 00:04:06,785
some of your other normal culprits,

110
00:04:06,785 --> 00:04:08,424
different food additives.

111
00:04:08,424 --> 00:04:11,179
Now, they might look scary
but they're all in there

112
00:04:11,179 --> 00:04:13,128
for a functional purpose, right?

113
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:14,824
So for instance, it looks scary.

114
00:04:14,824 --> 00:04:17,605
Xanthan gum, that's just a dietary fiber

115
00:04:17,605 --> 00:04:19,230
that we add to food.

116
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,851
We add it to eggs because we
don't want the egg to crumble

117
00:04:21,851 --> 00:04:23,988
when you bite into it
and fall into your lap.

118
00:04:23,988 --> 00:04:26,673
Modified corn starch, that just provides

119
00:04:26,673 --> 00:04:28,590
a little bit of texture to the product.

120
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,731
And then you have all
these different flavors

121
00:04:30,731 --> 00:04:33,179
and you might ask, well
why not just add butter?

122
00:04:33,179 --> 00:04:36,230
Because butter oxidizes and
makes the product go stale.

123
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,618
So, instead, we add these flavors that

124
00:04:38,618 --> 00:04:40,587
won't oxidize and produce a bad taste.

125
00:04:40,587 --> 00:04:41,666
- Well you just expressed a bias.

126
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:42,989
I love that it's a real egg.

127
00:04:42,989 --> 00:04:45,030
I sorta wish I didn't have to
add all these things in there

128
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,385
but I know you guys
have other technologies.

129
00:04:46,385 --> 00:04:50,404
We have a way of making the
frozen, microwavable breakfast

130
00:04:50,404 --> 00:04:52,922
flavorful and locking in that flavor

131
00:04:52,922 --> 00:04:55,619
and it has to do with this,
and you're a flavor scientist,

132
00:04:55,619 --> 00:04:57,262
so what does this have to do with flavor?

133
00:04:57,262 --> 00:04:59,862
- So, there's two main things
that you have to worry about

134
00:04:59,862 --> 00:05:01,913
in products like egg sandwiches.

135
00:05:01,913 --> 00:05:05,454
One is water because we know
water makes things go bad,

136
00:05:05,454 --> 00:05:09,526
and two is oxygen because
oxygen oxidizes things.

137
00:05:09,526 --> 00:05:10,797
So what do we do?

138
00:05:10,797 --> 00:05:14,287
We freeze the water because
frozen water can't do much

139
00:05:14,287 --> 00:05:18,171
and then we add nitrogen to
the bag or to the package.

140
00:05:18,171 --> 00:05:20,754
So, very similar to what
you see in potato chips.

141
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:23,639
If you buy a bag of potato
chips with all the air inside,

142
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:24,799
that's nitrogen.

143
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:27,768
When you open then bag,
then the oxygen comes in.

144
00:05:27,768 --> 00:05:29,822
You leave it out for a
day and it goes stale.

145
00:05:29,822 --> 00:05:31,670
The same thing happens
with egg sandwiches.

146
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,394
- All right, so let's take
a look at different types of

147
00:05:33,394 --> 00:05:35,664
frozen breakfasts that we
find at the grocery store.

148
00:05:35,664 --> 00:05:37,410
I took that list that you just got Mara,

149
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,482
that treasure trove and I split it out,

150
00:05:39,482 --> 00:05:41,713
and I know that there's a big keto move.

151
00:05:41,713 --> 00:05:44,068
So explain how people
have hacked that system.

152
00:05:44,068 --> 00:05:46,221
- Yeah, so just as a reminder, it's very,

153
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,494
very high fat, very low carb.

154
00:05:48,494 --> 00:05:50,168
So when you take a look at these

155
00:05:50,168 --> 00:05:52,163
traditional breakfast sandwiches here,

156
00:05:52,163 --> 00:05:53,672
these are not gonna be an option

157
00:05:53,672 --> 00:05:55,767
for keto followers because of the bread.

158
00:05:55,767 --> 00:05:58,182
But when you look over
here, this is really

159
00:05:58,182 --> 00:06:00,672
a game changer if you're keto devotee.

160
00:06:00,672 --> 00:06:03,255
They have made the bread out of eggs.

161
00:06:03,255 --> 00:06:05,062
So this is breadless.

162
00:06:05,062 --> 00:06:06,514
It's essentially,
(audience applause)

163
00:06:06,514 --> 00:06:07,601
two egg patties--

164
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:09,043
- I saw that, I wasn't
sure if that was real.

165
00:06:09,043 --> 00:06:11,534
- It's real, it's eggs,
it is high protein.

166
00:06:11,534 --> 00:06:13,058
It is extremely low carb.

167
00:06:13,058 --> 00:06:13,936
- So egg bun.

168
00:06:13,936 --> 00:06:16,532
- Yeah, so this is the industry
responding to that demand.

169
00:06:16,532 --> 00:06:19,459
They have heard loud and clear
what low carb dieters want.

170
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:20,908
- All right, so seven grams of carbs.

171
00:06:20,908 --> 00:06:22,370
How do the rest of your options compare?

172
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,185
- Yeah so you can see
it's a big difference.

173
00:06:24,185 --> 00:06:26,570
So the English muffin
option, 28 grams of carbs,

174
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:27,727
so I've never been good
at math but I think

175
00:06:27,727 --> 00:06:29,128
that's four times the
amount, right, roughly.

176
00:06:29,128 --> 00:06:30,148
- You're better than you say.

177
00:06:30,148 --> 00:06:31,418
It's exactly four times it.

178
00:06:31,418 --> 00:06:33,797
- And here we have the
croissant, 27 grams,

179
00:06:33,797 --> 00:06:35,073
pretty much the same.

180
00:06:35,073 --> 00:06:36,321
The biscuit, which to me looks like

181
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:38,037
the most delectable, delicious one.

182
00:06:38,037 --> 00:06:39,133
- [Dr. Oz] I think that's
a pretty good deal.

183
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:40,866
- Oh my goodness, I'm working
hard not to take a bite.

184
00:06:40,866 --> 00:06:41,699
- But this is intriguing to me.

185
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:43,097
Flatbread's a good idea.

186
00:06:43,097 --> 00:06:44,408
- Flatbread is a great idea.

187
00:06:44,408 --> 00:06:46,902
You see that it is the
lowest carb of all of them

188
00:06:46,902 --> 00:06:48,719
but still much higher
than the breadless one.

189
00:06:48,719 --> 00:06:50,104
- Now you tasted these and you had

190
00:06:50,104 --> 00:06:51,791
that discerning of you taste as well.

191
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,357
How did this breadless version do?

192
00:06:53,357 --> 00:06:54,889
- It was absolutely delicious.

193
00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:56,426
I did not miss the bread at all.

194
00:06:56,426 --> 00:06:59,411
But I did have to wonder,
is that too much protein?

195
00:06:59,411 --> 00:07:00,582
Am I overdoing it?

196
00:07:00,582 --> 00:07:02,589
- I looked into it, I
think the protein's okay.

197
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,469
The bigger concern for me is salt.

198
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:06,172
Sometimes in order to make it flavorful,

199
00:07:06,172 --> 00:07:07,472
because when you freeze things it

200
00:07:07,472 --> 00:07:08,698
doesn't taste the same always.

201
00:07:08,698 --> 00:07:09,923
They can have more salt than you want.

202
00:07:09,923 --> 00:07:11,100
So just take a look at that.

203
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,735
But overall I was impressed
that you had this many options.

204
00:07:13,735 --> 00:07:15,460
But I wanna go to our
audience member here,

205
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,697
'cause the next microwavable
frozen breakfast investigation

206
00:07:17,697 --> 00:07:21,063
had to do with the crustless quiches.

207
00:07:21,063 --> 00:07:23,269
There's no carbs in a crustless quiche.

208
00:07:23,269 --> 00:07:24,558
Do I have this right?

209
00:07:24,558 --> 00:07:25,648
- [Lisa] Yes.

210
00:07:25,648 --> 00:07:26,685
(laughing)

211
00:07:26,685 --> 00:07:27,711
- Well I wanna do a thing.

212
00:07:27,711 --> 00:07:29,409
Compare these two and see
if you taste the difference.

213
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:30,998
Mara, you can go do it as well, here.

214
00:07:30,998 --> 00:07:32,966
- Oh thank you, I thought you'd never ask.

215
00:07:32,966 --> 00:07:33,799
- Exactly.

216
00:07:33,799 --> 00:07:36,366
I figured you eat them all
at home before you got here.

217
00:07:36,366 --> 00:07:38,600
I'm gonna reveal something
to you in a second,

218
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,382
but these are not quite made the same way.

219
00:07:40,382 --> 00:07:41,794
So, which do you like more of these?

220
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:42,918
- This one's much better.

221
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:43,751
- Much better?
- Mhmm.

222
00:07:43,751 --> 00:07:45,660
All right, so I'm just gonna
reveal something to you.

223
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,284
One of these is actually
homemade, by yours truly.

224
00:07:48,284 --> 00:07:50,938
And the other one was made in a store.

225
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:53,395
This was made by us.

226
00:07:53,395 --> 00:07:54,844
- [Lisa] Nice job, Dr. Oz.

227
00:07:54,844 --> 00:07:55,677
- [Mara] Oh wow.

228
00:07:55,677 --> 00:07:57,183
- This is the store bought one.

229
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:00,730
I only point it out because
this didn't take a ton of time.

230
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,843
I think most people prefer it,

231
00:08:02,843 --> 00:08:04,461
but I get why you don't do it.

232
00:08:04,461 --> 00:08:05,646
It's a lack of time.

233
00:08:05,646 --> 00:08:07,392
Does this taste good enough that if

234
00:08:07,392 --> 00:08:08,867
you didn't have time to
make that on your own

235
00:08:08,867 --> 00:08:09,788
you'd still be okay with it?

236
00:08:09,788 --> 00:08:11,049
- Yeah I'd be okay with it.

237
00:08:11,049 --> 00:08:12,235
- All right, so it works.

238
00:08:12,235 --> 00:08:13,585
- Yeah, it's a great option.

239
00:08:13,585 --> 00:08:14,895
- You pick and choose what you want,

240
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,928
I don't think it's quite the
same as making it yourself

241
00:08:16,928 --> 00:08:18,786
but it's probably good enough for most,

242
00:08:18,786 --> 00:08:20,160
especially busy moms out there.

243
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,520
How do they compare nutritionally?

244
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,205
- So it's actually, there's
a lot of good news here.

245
00:08:24,205 --> 00:08:26,725
These have, the store bought ones,

246
00:08:26,725 --> 00:08:28,770
are real egg or egg base,

247
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,492
which is just basically liquid egg.

248
00:08:30,492 --> 00:08:32,287
Now they do have other things added in

249
00:08:32,287 --> 00:08:34,000
because they do have to live on a shelf,

250
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,110
they do have to be frozen.

251
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:37,581
But for the most part it is
very close to the real thing.

252
00:08:37,581 --> 00:08:38,827
You can feel good about eating them

253
00:08:38,827 --> 00:08:40,051
and giving them to your kids.

254
00:08:40,051 --> 00:08:41,468
- Show off at home, Lisa.

255
00:08:41,468 --> 00:08:42,927
All right, me, one last stop.

256
00:08:42,927 --> 00:08:45,348
We invested frozen microwave
breakfast burritos.

257
00:08:45,348 --> 00:08:47,139
Taylor these have been getting

258
00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:48,545
a lot of criticism over the years,

259
00:08:48,545 --> 00:08:50,528
but they seem to be making a comeback.

260
00:08:50,528 --> 00:08:52,640
- Right, you know, when I was a kid,

261
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,658
it was like these things
are terrible, right?

262
00:08:54,658 --> 00:08:57,156
I mean they're mushy
and gooey and not great.

263
00:08:57,156 --> 00:08:59,627
Food scientists have this down to an art

264
00:08:59,627 --> 00:09:02,582
and now, just like over
there, they taste fantastic.

265
00:09:02,582 --> 00:09:05,342
And not only that, there's
vegetarian options,

266
00:09:05,342 --> 00:09:07,216
there's farm to table options.

267
00:09:07,216 --> 00:09:08,952
We've got something for everybody.

268
00:09:08,952 --> 00:09:10,749
- So you still wanna
watch the sodium on these,

269
00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:12,149
especially if you got pressure issues.

270
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:14,337
We always say make bacon a special food,

271
00:09:14,337 --> 00:09:16,011
so you don't want to have
that every day either.

272
00:09:16,011 --> 00:09:17,270
Maybe twice a week kinda thing.

273
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,210
When we come back we show you a brand new

274
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:20,875
microwavable breakfast that allows you

275
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,588
to use your own fresh egg.

276
00:09:22,588 --> 00:09:24,478
Is it the best of both worlds?

277
00:09:24,478 --> 00:09:25,995
We'll find out when we come back.

00:09:43,974 --> 00:09:46,027
- The prosection painted this idea

286
00:09:46,027 --> 00:09:49,502
that this was a black widow
out for revenge and money.

287
00:09:49,502 --> 00:09:51,153
- [Narrator] But did she really get her

288
00:09:51,153 --> 00:09:53,408
15 year old lover to pull the trigger?

289
00:09:53,408 --> 00:09:54,671
- Why isn't she crying?

290
00:09:54,671 --> 00:09:55,774

sleeping these days.

308
00:10:34,109 --> 00:10:35,632
So Alteril contains three different

309
00:10:35,632 --> 00:10:37,429
effective sleep compounds that work

310
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:39,698

brain for restful sleep

311

If you have trouble sleeping, try Alteril.

313
00:10:43,155 --> 00:10:44,770
Alteril is not like other sleep aids

314
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:47,364
because Alteril contains three
unique sleeping compounds

- If you have ever tried to make an omelet

360
00:12:39,335 --> 00:12:41,687
and this happens, right, you're not alone.

361
00:12:41,687 --> 00:12:43,964
Guess what, restaurants, the
best places in the world,

362
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:46,024
using making an omelet
as the ultimate test

363
00:12:46,024 --> 00:12:47,571
of a chef's true skill.

364
00:12:47,571 --> 00:12:49,974
So I didn't pass this time,
but I'm getting better.

365
00:12:49,974 --> 00:12:51,020
I can cover it up.

366
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,313
I can stitch this back together again.

367
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,275
I got the stick knowledge.

368
00:12:53,275 --> 00:12:55,745
Anyway, today we're investigating
a brand new shortcut

369
00:12:55,745 --> 00:12:57,826
turning omelets into
a weekday quickie meal

370
00:12:57,826 --> 00:12:59,302
using your own microwave.

371
00:12:59,302 --> 00:13:01,483
These are called omelets in a cup.

372
00:13:01,483 --> 00:13:03,342
Now food scientist Taylor Wallace is here

373
00:13:03,342 --> 00:13:04,948
to help us figure out
what's really in these.

374
00:13:04,948 --> 00:13:07,105
There's too many kinds
of omelets in a cup.

375
00:13:07,105 --> 00:13:08,355
Break them up for us.
(audience applause)

376
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:11,059
- Okay, so your first kind, go
ahead and open that package,

377
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:13,574
and what you'll see, it's
got everything inside.

378
00:13:13,574 --> 00:13:16,545
So you've got your little
vegetables and meat.

379
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,603
And then you have a liquid egg,

380
00:13:18,603 --> 00:13:20,288
so go on and check it out.

381
00:13:20,288 --> 00:13:22,733
And a liquid egg is
basically the same thing

382
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:24,541
that you buy in the grocery store

383
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,482
in those milk carton-like jugs.

384
00:13:26,482 --> 00:13:28,848
It's just been pasteurized
a little bit more

385
00:13:28,848 --> 00:13:31,115
than the old way to prevent
bacteria from growing.

386
00:13:31,115 --> 00:13:31,999
- So pour it in here?

387
00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:33,169
- Yep, so pour it right in.

388
00:13:33,169 --> 00:13:34,370
You can pop it in the microwave

389
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,151
and you're ready to go basically.

390
00:13:36,151 --> 00:13:37,754
- [Dr. Oz] Put my fixings
in there, I'm good to go.

391
00:13:37,754 --> 00:13:38,643
- [Taylor] Absolutely.

392
00:13:38,643 --> 00:13:39,738
- It's so easy, so simple.

393
00:13:39,738 --> 00:13:41,345
So how is yours different?

394
00:13:41,345 --> 00:13:43,808
- So the second one, this is for consumers

395
00:13:43,808 --> 00:13:46,440
that prefer their products
a little less processed.

396
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,315
So we charge 'em the same price

397
00:13:48,315 --> 00:13:50,851
but don't add the egg,
you have to add your own.

398
00:13:50,851 --> 00:13:52,441
- You're kidding me, it's the same price?

399
00:13:52,441 --> 00:13:55,477
- Right, and instead of the
egg you have to add your own

400
00:13:55,477 --> 00:13:56,802
and it's not a liquid egg.

401
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:58,467
So if you see, you've got the cheese,

402
00:13:58,467 --> 00:14:00,443
the vegetables, the meat in there,

403
00:14:00,443 --> 00:14:02,368
same thing as in your other product.

404
00:14:02,368 --> 00:14:03,457
- Break the egg.

405
00:14:03,457 --> 00:14:05,530
You have to break it on plastic.

406
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:06,612
Oh my goodness.

407
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:11,047
Here, break it over here,
and put it in the pan, there.

408
00:14:11,047 --> 00:14:12,031
All right.

409
00:14:12,031 --> 00:14:12,864
That's it.

410
00:14:12,864 --> 00:14:14,168
And you add the goodies in there.

411
00:14:14,168 --> 00:14:15,341
- [Taylor] Then you add the stuff,

412
00:14:15,341 --> 00:14:17,526
mix it up, and there you go.
(audience applause)

413
00:14:17,526 --> 00:14:19,007
- I gotta say I'm impressed.

414
00:14:19,007 --> 00:14:21,389
This is actually so close to
what I would normally wanna do,

415
00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:22,802
I'd probably think about this.

416
00:14:22,802 --> 00:14:23,930
- Right, and like Mara said,

417
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,977
they're very close to
the normal food product

418
00:14:25,977 --> 00:14:27,650
that you would cook in your kitchen.

419
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,326
Got a little bit of additives in there

420
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:32,051
to help prevent mold
growth or bacteria growth,

421
00:14:32,051 --> 00:14:34,245
but overall it's the same thing.

422
00:14:34,245 --> 00:14:36,333
- A food scientist is happy, I'm happy.

423
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,388
All right, and the price
you mentioned is the same.

424
00:14:38,388 --> 00:14:40,757
- Yeah the price, I
mentioned, is about $3 a pack.

425
00:14:40,757 --> 00:14:43,004
So great for someone
like a college student

426
00:14:43,004 --> 00:14:45,150
or somebody like you and
I that are on the go.

427
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,049
Might not wanna feed
the whole family with it

428
00:14:47,049 --> 00:14:48,566
'cause that gets kind of expensive.

429
00:14:48,566 --> 00:14:49,849
But great on the go.

430
00:14:49,849 --> 00:14:52,849

The National Weather Service

00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:25,083

to replace the flash flood warning

449
00:15:46,053 --> 00:15:47,472
that has been in effect.

450
00:15:47,472 --> 00:15:49,914

00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,336
you learn to talk to yourself.

501
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:09,401
What you don't learn is
how to talk to others.

502
00:18:09,401 --> 00:18:13,202
The black line on the bottom
of the pool never talks back.

503
00:18:13,202 --> 00:18:15,415
If I could go back in time I would tell

504
00:18:15,415 --> 00:18:17,040
my younger self to open up,

505
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,318
and to work with a professional therapist.

- [Announcer] Around
here, even a little rain

512
00:18:35,061 --> 00:18:37,378
makes us downright giddy.

513
00:18:37,378 --> 00:18:39,358
That's because we've seen it do

514
00:18:39,358 --> 00:18:41,880
some pretty spectacular things.

515
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,582
See for yourself at Luray Caverns.

516
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:46,499
What will you discover?

517
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:55,600
(microwave beeping)

518
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,206
- I know,
(audience applause)

519
00:18:57,206 --> 00:18:59,561
did you start to salivate at that sound?

520
00:18:59,561 --> 00:19:01,199
You start to think about food when

521
00:19:01,199 --> 00:19:02,995
the beep starts with your microwave.

522
00:19:02,995 --> 00:19:05,405
Millions of you rely on
quick microwave meals

523
00:19:05,405 --> 00:19:08,187
because it's a quick lunch or
ready in minutes hot dinner.

524
00:19:08,187 --> 00:19:12,571
But can you get addicted to
these fast food frozen foods?

525
00:19:12,571 --> 00:19:14,322
How does your freezer look?

526
00:19:14,322 --> 00:19:15,933
Does it look like this?

527
00:19:15,933 --> 00:19:18,162
Someone in our audience is the owner of

528
00:19:18,162 --> 00:19:21,855
this stocked freezer full
of those microwave meals

529
00:19:21,855 --> 00:19:23,980
and is being turned in for their obsession

530
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,094
with microwave meals.

531
00:19:25,094 --> 00:19:27,264
Please welcome Angela, who's turning in

532
00:19:27,264 --> 00:19:29,201
her best friend Suella.

533
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,253
- Hi Dr. Oz.

534
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:31,194
(laughing)

535
00:19:31,194 --> 00:19:33,459
- Suella, you didn't know
this was happening did you?

536
00:19:33,459 --> 00:19:34,294
- No, no.

537
00:19:34,294 --> 00:19:35,609
I think I'm fine.

538
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:36,851
- [Dr. Oz] You think you're fine.

539
00:19:36,851 --> 00:19:37,904
What is the issue here?

540
00:19:37,904 --> 00:19:38,830
- She has a problem.

541
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,184
She has a very big problem.

542
00:19:40,184 --> 00:19:41,606
- And that's a real photo of her freezer.

543
00:19:41,606 --> 00:19:42,439
- Yes.

544
00:19:42,439 --> 00:19:43,478
- [Dr. Oz] And how often is she eating

545
00:19:43,478 --> 00:19:44,917
microwave frozen food?

546
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:45,750
- All the time.

547
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,761
Breakfasts, lunch, snack.

548
00:19:47,761 --> 00:19:48,636
- I'm busy.

549
00:19:48,636 --> 00:19:49,469
- No, it's no.

550
00:19:49,469 --> 00:19:50,494
- I really love it.

551
00:19:50,494 --> 00:19:51,327
- No.

552
00:19:51,327 --> 00:19:53,108
- [Dr. Oz] Well what do
you love about it so much?

553
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,734
- Well they have healthy
ones, I eat Lean Cuisine,

554
00:19:55,734 --> 00:19:59,556
I like hot pockets sometimes
when I'm really in a rush.

555
00:19:59,556 --> 00:20:01,512
So you know, easy is convenient.

556
00:20:01,512 --> 00:20:03,321
- What do you think about
your friend's concern

557
00:20:03,321 --> 00:20:06,563
over your perceived addiction
towards microwave fast food?

558
00:20:06,563 --> 00:20:08,398
- I don't know what her concern is.

559
00:20:08,398 --> 00:20:09,742
- You don't know my concern?

560
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:10,575
- No.

561
00:20:10,575 --> 00:20:14,192
- You send me coupons, you
wanna buy things off Ebay.

562
00:20:14,192 --> 00:20:16,200
It's microwavable food.

563
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,124
No, you go to the dollar store,
you go to all of the stores.

564
00:20:19,124 --> 00:20:20,530
No, no, no, it's too much.

565
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:21,837
- Pot pies, really good.

566
00:20:21,837 --> 00:20:23,006
- Let's just talk about,

567
00:20:23,006 --> 00:20:24,292
come on up here a little bit Suella.

568
00:20:24,292 --> 00:20:25,535
We got a little discussion.

569
00:20:25,535 --> 00:20:28,263
I understand the allure of frozen meals,

570
00:20:28,263 --> 00:20:32,297
but in reality, there's
something that's really addictive

571
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:34,288
in these foods that makes
them so desirous for us.

572
00:20:34,288 --> 00:20:35,535
- And they taste good.

573
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:37,952
- So Mark Schatzker, food
journalist extraordinaire,

574
00:20:37,952 --> 00:20:39,182
and a real expert in the area,

575
00:20:39,182 --> 00:20:40,508
he's made a taste test
for us that you and I

576
00:20:40,508 --> 00:20:41,548
are gonna be participants in.

577
00:20:41,548 --> 00:20:42,713
But you gotta tell the truth though.

578
00:20:42,713 --> 00:20:43,546
- All right.

579
00:20:43,546 --> 00:20:44,806
- So take us, what are we gonna taste

580
00:20:44,806 --> 00:20:46,403
and what kind of an
organization do you have here?

581
00:20:46,403 --> 00:20:47,584
- Okay we got three lasagnas.

582
00:20:47,584 --> 00:20:49,660
The first one is fresh
lasagna, we made this,

583
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,500
this is like what you'd make at home.

584
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,426
This is also lasagna
we made but not fresh.

585
00:20:53,426 --> 00:20:56,597
We froze it, and then we reheated it.

586
00:20:56,597 --> 00:20:57,430
- Mm.

587
00:20:58,377 --> 00:21:00,565
That fresh is good.

588
00:21:00,565 --> 00:21:02,380
Keep going, I'm moving along here.

589
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,877
- And then we got, this is
the microwavable lasagna

590
00:21:04,877 --> 00:21:06,475
like you'd buy at the supermarket.

591
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:08,173
- [Dr. Oz] This is the microwave here.

592
00:21:08,173 --> 00:21:12,196
- [Mark] There'll be
something interesting here.

593
00:21:12,196 --> 00:21:13,639
- That is good.

594
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,165
That is really good.

595
00:21:15,165 --> 00:21:16,971
- Tell me what you like about it.

596
00:21:16,971 --> 00:21:18,181
- You should have this.

597
00:21:18,181 --> 00:21:19,467
You'd like it.

598
00:21:19,467 --> 00:21:20,921
- Yeah it tastes real good.

599
00:21:20,921 --> 00:21:22,952
- Okay so there's something
really interesting.

600
00:21:22,952 --> 00:21:24,757
- This is actually better than the fresh.

601
00:21:24,757 --> 00:21:25,797
- Better than fresh.

602
00:21:25,797 --> 00:21:27,490
Something really
interesting happening here.

603
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:29,758
So this is another tale
of taste bud trickery.

604
00:21:29,758 --> 00:21:32,352
This is where it's in the flavor.

605
00:21:32,352 --> 00:21:35,351
It's in how they created this experience

606
00:21:35,351 --> 00:21:38,203
of lasagna in a frozen
food where we're gonna

607
00:21:38,203 --> 00:21:39,375
find something interesting.

608
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,778
- Let's uncover the anatomy
of a microwave meal.

609
00:21:41,778 --> 00:21:43,360
How do they actually pull that off?

610
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,614
'Cause I do think, like
you, that definitely tastes

611
00:21:45,614 --> 00:21:47,897
better than the frozen stuff
that you made yourself.

612
00:21:47,897 --> 00:21:49,196
What do they do differently?

613
00:21:49,196 --> 00:21:50,815
So the first issue is preservatives.

614
00:21:50,815 --> 00:21:52,276
Mark, what kind are we talking about?

615
00:21:52,276 --> 00:21:53,820
- Okay so yeah, one thing
they do to get that flavor,

616
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,344
they use synthetic flavorings.

617
00:21:55,344 --> 00:21:56,549
We've talked about that before,

618
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:58,319
but that's how they jack up that flavor.

619
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:00,922
We also see a lot of
the same guilty suspects

620
00:22:00,922 --> 00:22:03,384
that we see in other processed foods.

621
00:22:03,384 --> 00:22:06,099
There's polysorbate 80,
that's a bulking agent,

622
00:22:06,099 --> 00:22:08,399
that makes the sauce
taste nice and smooth.

623
00:22:08,399 --> 00:22:10,448
There's something called
potassium bromate,

624
00:22:10,448 --> 00:22:11,904
that's a dough additive.

625
00:22:11,904 --> 00:22:13,777
It's actually illegal in some countries.

626
00:22:13,777 --> 00:22:14,884
And then we have sodium nitrite.

627
00:22:14,884 --> 00:22:16,177
Now we've talked about that--

628
00:22:16,177 --> 00:22:17,537
- [Dr. Oz] It's illegal in some countries?

629
00:22:17,537 --> 00:22:18,383
- It's illegal.

630
00:22:18,383 --> 00:22:21,140
And it's in our frozen foods.

631
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,142
- So these are theoretical concerns,

632
00:22:23,142 --> 00:22:25,020
but next issue is a real concern,

633
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,220
which is sugar.

634
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,693
And how much sugar...

635
00:22:27,693 --> 00:22:29,578
Actually why would you
even add sugar to lasagna?

636
00:22:29,578 --> 00:22:30,674
There's already pasta in there.

637
00:22:30,674 --> 00:22:33,298
- Well because, as we saw,
the flavor takes a beating.

638
00:22:33,298 --> 00:22:35,584
So what's an easy way to
jack that flavor back up?

639
00:22:35,584 --> 00:22:36,851
Just dump in some sugar.

640
00:22:36,851 --> 00:22:38,913
And you're gonna be shocked at how much.

641
00:22:38,913 --> 00:22:40,934
We found one frozen entree that had

642
00:22:40,934 --> 00:22:43,441
29 grams of sugar in a serving.

643
00:22:43,441 --> 00:22:45,128
- Suella, do you hear that?

644
00:22:45,128 --> 00:22:46,014
29 grams.

645
00:22:46,014 --> 00:22:48,454
- Okay, it gets worse, 'cause
guess how big the serving is.

646
00:22:48,454 --> 00:22:49,306
This big.

647
00:22:49,306 --> 00:22:50,262
It's only half.

648
00:22:50,262 --> 00:22:52,386
Most people think, they pull
it out of their microwave

649
00:22:52,386 --> 00:22:53,683
and they think I get
to eat the whole thing.

650
00:22:53,683 --> 00:22:54,516
- Yes.

651
00:22:54,516 --> 00:22:56,676
- Well then you're
getting 58 grams of sugar.

652
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:58,816
That's the sugar that's in two candy bars.

653
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:01,313
So who would ever thinking
I'm nuking my dinner,

654
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:03,467
there's two candy bars
worth of sugar in there?

655
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:04,347
It's crazy.

656
00:23:04,347 --> 00:23:06,066
- So a lot of sugar, and there's another

657
00:23:06,066 --> 00:23:08,071
hidden source of carbs.

658
00:23:08,071 --> 00:23:09,343
Modified starch.

659
00:23:09,343 --> 00:23:10,367
Which I don't even know what...

660
00:23:10,367 --> 00:23:11,970
What do you modify starch to do?

661
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:13,444
- Yeah modified starch, what is it?

662
00:23:13,444 --> 00:23:15,442
Well it's there to get rid
of some of the problems

663
00:23:15,442 --> 00:23:17,238
that you get when you reheat frozen foods,

664
00:23:17,238 --> 00:23:18,884
so you don't get those puddles of water,

665
00:23:18,884 --> 00:23:20,190
so that it holds its shape.

666
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,516
But it's essentially
carbohydrates that have no flavor.

667
00:23:22,516 --> 00:23:24,312
So you're getting carbs in your tummy

668
00:23:24,312 --> 00:23:25,741
that you don't taste on the way down,

669
00:23:25,741 --> 00:23:27,232
and I think that's where the worry is.

670
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,429
- So stay with Mark for a sec,

671
00:23:28,429 --> 00:23:29,438
I'm gonna explain to
everybody what happens

672
00:23:29,438 --> 00:23:31,165
to your brain while you're having

673
00:23:31,165 --> 00:23:33,293
all these empty carbs
that are hidden from you.

674
00:23:33,293 --> 00:23:35,484
You got the brain here, you got you there.

675
00:23:35,484 --> 00:23:37,511
Take a bite out of one of these meals,

676
00:23:37,511 --> 00:23:39,566
and what ends up happening is you begin

677
00:23:39,566 --> 00:23:41,768
to fall in love with
it, begin to crave it.

678
00:23:41,768 --> 00:23:44,360
Then what happens, your blood
sugar starts to spike up.

679
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,937
When the blood sugar goes up,

680
00:23:45,937 --> 00:23:47,920
dopamine is released from your brain

681
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,880
which makes you really happy, smiley.

682
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,577
We all know that, right, our comfort food.

683
00:23:51,577 --> 00:23:55,038
But then, over time, your blood
sugar falls back down again,

684
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:57,584
and you crave that high you just had.

685
00:23:57,584 --> 00:23:59,532
So your low blood sugar levels

686
00:23:59,532 --> 00:24:01,318
cause an increased appetite, right,

687
00:24:01,318 --> 00:24:03,094
you eat more food because the time

688
00:24:03,094 --> 00:24:04,627
seems like it's the right to do.

689
00:24:04,627 --> 00:24:06,320
And the next thing you know you eat more

690
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,262
of those frozen meals
that you've been craving

691
00:24:08,262 --> 00:24:10,228
and feeling okay about doing it.

692
00:24:10,228 --> 00:24:12,185
So Mark, you say in addition to this,

693
00:24:12,185 --> 00:24:14,096
which is sort of like
a chemical addiction,

694
00:24:14,096 --> 00:24:16,020
there's a psychological addiction

695
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,790
these microwave meals can cause.

696
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,998
- Yeah, so we've seen
this interaction before.

697
00:24:19,998 --> 00:24:21,712
You got things like
foods with a lot of sugar

698
00:24:21,712 --> 00:24:23,000
and flavoring makes it compulsive,

699
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,414
makes it really delicious in the moment,

700
00:24:24,414 --> 00:24:25,487
hard to stop eating.

701
00:24:25,487 --> 00:24:27,022
So I think there's a lot of ways

702
00:24:27,022 --> 00:24:28,332
these get us eating too much.

703
00:24:28,332 --> 00:24:29,572
- So don't be a killjoy here.

704
00:24:29,572 --> 00:24:30,905
If we're gonna eat our microwave,

705
00:24:30,905 --> 00:24:33,552
'cause I think Suella, who's
nervously laughing now,

706
00:24:33,552 --> 00:24:35,785
is probably gonna still
eat some of the microwaves

707
00:24:35,785 --> 00:24:37,008
that are in her freezer.

708
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:38,418
Give us some tact and some hacks.

709
00:24:38,418 --> 00:24:40,926
- Okay so one thing is to
look at the ingredient list,

710
00:24:40,926 --> 00:24:42,341
'cause they're not all the same.

711
00:24:42,341 --> 00:24:45,016
The ingredients that come at
the beginning of the list,

712
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:46,161
there's more of them.

713
00:24:46,161 --> 00:24:47,221
So look for the good things.

714
00:24:47,221 --> 00:24:49,093
If it's a broccoli
pasta, look for broccoli

715
00:24:49,093 --> 00:24:50,638
at the beginning of the ingredient list.

716
00:24:50,638 --> 00:24:52,465
If it's at the very end,
that means there's not much,

717
00:24:52,465 --> 00:24:54,524
and if you don't see it at
all, be worried about that.

718
00:24:54,524 --> 00:24:56,522
- So Suella, I need your verdict here.

719
00:24:56,522 --> 00:25:00,225
Your friend, me, Professor
Shasker next to us,

720
00:25:00,225 --> 00:25:02,610
seems to think you're
probably better served

721
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:04,635
to eat your microwave
meals a little differently.

722
00:25:04,635 --> 00:25:05,653
What do you think?

723
00:25:05,653 --> 00:25:07,327
- I don't think I'll do it every day now.

724
00:25:07,327 --> 00:25:09,403
I think I'll do it like maybe twice,

725
00:25:09,403 --> 00:25:10,630
maybe three times a week.

726
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:13,365
Slowly process on my addiction on it.

727
00:25:13,365 --> 00:25:15,149
But thank you for the advice.

728
00:25:15,149 --> 00:25:16,918
- Schatzker, you're having an impact.

729
00:25:16,918 --> 00:25:18,592
Nicely done, thank you for saying that.

730
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,299
We'll be right back.

731

00:25:33,411 --> 00:25:34,928

00:28:32,731 --> 00:28:35,831
- We're back with our investigation
into public fat shaming.

809
00:28:35,831 --> 00:28:38,715
Would you know what to
do if it happened to you?

810
00:28:38,715 --> 00:28:40,881
What about if it came from the one person

811
00:28:40,881 --> 00:28:43,088
you trust the most, your own doctor?

812
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:45,380
According to one study,
about half of women,

813
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,216
half, say they've been
shamed by a physician,

814
00:28:48,216 --> 00:28:50,387
with weight being one of the top reasons.

815
00:28:50,387 --> 00:28:52,814
Latoya says she was fat
shamed by her doctor,

816
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,780
who ignored her pain symptoms.

817
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:57,980
After feeling ill, Rebecca
says her doctor told her

818
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:00,340
to lose weight, but turns
out her health issues

819
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,223
were not a result of her size.

820
00:29:02,223 --> 00:29:03,980
It was actually cancer.

821
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,270
So Rebecca, let's talk about your case,

822
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,353
it's pretty serious.

823
00:29:07,353 --> 00:29:09,280
So you go to the doctor,
you're not feeling well,

824
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,671
how did the physicians
respond to the observations

825
00:29:12,671 --> 00:29:14,361
you were making about your own body?

826
00:29:14,361 --> 00:29:19,248
- Yeah so a lot of times it
was very much a dismissal.

827
00:29:19,248 --> 00:29:22,024
It was kind of a dismissal of symptoms,

828
00:29:22,024 --> 00:29:24,209
over and over and over again.

829
00:29:24,209 --> 00:29:26,555
Just a well basically if you just lost

830
00:29:26,555 --> 00:29:28,435
a little bit of weight you'd be fine.

831
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:30,851
If you just lost a bit of
weight you could breathe better.

832
00:29:30,851 --> 00:29:32,477
We don't really know what's going on

833
00:29:32,477 --> 00:29:33,980
but if you just lot a bit of weight

834
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,398
everything will be okay.

835
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:37,426
- So after three years,
three years everybody,

836
00:29:37,426 --> 00:29:39,763
of looking around, you
finally got a diagnosis.

837
00:29:39,763 --> 00:29:42,543
What was really happening
inside your body?

838
00:29:42,543 --> 00:29:47,543
- I had a tumor in my left
main stem bronchus in my lung,

839
00:29:48,038 --> 00:29:52,274
and it had kind of killed
the bottom half of my lung

840
00:29:52,274 --> 00:29:54,459
and they had to take
the whole left lung out.

841
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,485
- In part 'cause it
took three years I think

842
00:29:56,485 --> 00:29:58,173
to figure out what was going on.

843
00:29:58,173 --> 00:29:59,125
- Yeah.

844
00:29:59,125 --> 00:30:01,652
- What was it like when
you finally realized

845
00:30:01,652 --> 00:30:03,612
you actually had a life
threatening problem

846
00:30:03,612 --> 00:30:06,514
that was causing this and not
an issue with your weight,

847
00:30:06,514 --> 00:30:08,873
which you never thought was
the problem to begin with?

848
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:11,546
- It was the first time that like I had

849
00:30:11,546 --> 00:30:13,716
finally gotten a diagnosis and I had spent

850
00:30:13,716 --> 00:30:15,905
so much time trying to figure
out what was wrong with me,

851
00:30:15,905 --> 00:30:17,997
and then somebody finally told
me that something was wrong,

852
00:30:17,997 --> 00:30:20,379
and it was just so freeing to realize

853
00:30:20,379 --> 00:30:22,634
that there was something
that was actually there,

854
00:30:22,634 --> 00:30:24,256
that like no I'm not just fat,

855
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,826
something is wrong in this body.

856
00:30:25,826 --> 00:30:27,947
- So I wish you were
the only person who felt

857
00:30:27,947 --> 00:30:30,290
the way you have stated you felt,

858
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:32,788
'cause it turns out that obese patients

859
00:30:32,788 --> 00:30:35,606
are 65% more likely than others to have

860
00:30:35,606 --> 00:30:38,269
significant undiagnosed
medical conditions.

861
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:41,412
We write it off, say it's something else.

862
00:30:41,412 --> 00:30:44,170
And sometimes it is the
weight that's the problem,

863
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:45,576
but oftentimes it's not.

864
00:30:45,576 --> 00:30:46,983
Are you feeling okay now?

865
00:30:46,983 --> 00:30:50,296
- Yeah I've been cancer free since 2012.

866
00:30:50,296 --> 00:30:52,311
- [Dr. Oz] Good for you.
(audience applause)

867
00:30:52,311 --> 00:30:53,283
Good for you.

868
00:30:53,283 --> 00:30:54,116
- Thanks.

869
00:30:54,116 --> 00:30:55,040
Thank you.

870
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,499
- Latoya, let's talk about your story.

871
00:30:57,499 --> 00:31:01,705
Also an example of doctors
overlooking a real diagnosis.

872
00:31:01,705 --> 00:31:02,807
What happened?

873
00:31:02,807 --> 00:31:04,864
- Well in my case I've been in pain

874
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:08,148
for the past two decades, since I started

875
00:31:08,148 --> 00:31:11,288
my menstruation when I was about 10 or 11.

876
00:31:11,288 --> 00:31:14,605
All I can remember is
feeling this crippling

877
00:31:14,605 --> 00:31:18,362
paralyzing pain every time
my menzies would come about.

878
00:31:18,362 --> 00:31:21,263
When I went to the doctor initially it was

879
00:31:21,263 --> 00:31:23,831
well how about we give
you some birth control?

880
00:31:23,831 --> 00:31:26,372
When I started gaining, like I wanna say

881
00:31:26,372 --> 00:31:29,446
I started gaining weight,
particularly after I had my son,

882
00:31:29,446 --> 00:31:33,564
it was automatically shifted
to it has to be your weight.

883
00:31:33,564 --> 00:31:35,482
- So your doctors actually finally

884
00:31:35,482 --> 00:31:37,032
found the real diagnosis right?

885
00:31:37,032 --> 00:31:38,001
What was going on?

886
00:31:38,001 --> 00:31:39,615
- My real diagnosis was that I was

887
00:31:39,615 --> 00:31:41,359
diagnosed with endometriosis.

888
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:45,928
And that wasn't found until
I miscarried several times,

889
00:31:45,928 --> 00:31:48,760
like over, I stopped
counting after four times.

890
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,828
- Oh I'm sorry.

891
00:31:49,828 --> 00:31:52,586
- And it's something that so many people

892
00:31:52,586 --> 00:31:55,434
brush off as it's nothing.

893
00:31:55,434 --> 00:31:58,591
I find that's the issue in a lot of things

894
00:31:58,591 --> 00:32:00,184
in reproductive health.

895
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:02,560
- Well the reason I'm passionate about

896
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,406
this topic of fat
shaming is because it can

897
00:32:05,406 --> 00:32:07,500
embarrass people and people can do

898
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,205
bad things to themselves
because they're shamed by.

899
00:32:10,205 --> 00:32:12,436
But we also miss the real diagnosis,

900
00:32:12,436 --> 00:32:15,263
which is a much more obvious
way that we hurt people.

901
00:32:15,263 --> 00:32:17,189
Now I should share, Latoya's about to run

902
00:32:17,189 --> 00:32:19,069
her 17th marathon in three weeks.

903
00:32:19,069 --> 00:32:20,632
(audience applause)

904
00:32:20,632 --> 00:32:22,499
So you didn't get held
back, neither of you did.

905
00:32:22,499 --> 00:32:24,145
What is your message to doctors

906
00:32:24,145 --> 00:32:26,851
who are too easily writing off symptoms

907
00:32:26,851 --> 00:32:29,395
to their patients being overweight?

908
00:32:29,395 --> 00:32:31,272
- Actually listen to your patients.

909
00:32:31,272 --> 00:32:33,772
Be patient with your patients.

910
00:32:34,987 --> 00:32:37,365
Essentially, don't just brush it off

911
00:32:37,365 --> 00:32:40,576
or just look at them and then
try to give them a diagnosis.

912
00:32:40,576 --> 00:32:43,461
Actually do the work, look into it,

913
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,348
do blood tests, which I've had,

914
00:32:45,348 --> 00:32:47,520
which proved that I
didn't have some of these

915
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,073
things that they thought that I had.

916
00:32:49,073 --> 00:32:52,272
Actually listen to us, because
when you don't listen to us

917
00:32:52,272 --> 00:32:54,801
then we have a distrust, we have a worry,

918
00:32:54,801 --> 00:32:58,236
and a real fear that nobody
is going to take us serious.

919
00:32:58,236 --> 00:33:00,716
It makes people not want
to actually come to you

920

and we essentially go to you to trust you,

921

922
00:33:06,412 --> 00:33:07,974

1007
00:36:44,055 --> 00:36:48,085
It's a malicious and
disturbing online trend.

laziness and eating unhealthy,

shaming to the extreme,

1036
00:37:54,347 --> 00:37:56,651
posting this picture of a naked woman

1037
00:37:56,651 --> 00:37:59,530
with the comment if I can't unsee this

1038
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:01,319
then you can't either.

1039
00:38:01,319 --> 00:38:02,890
- [Female] You're abusing women.

1040
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:05,240
- [Female] I can't sit
here because they're both

1041
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,769
so big on left and right.

1042
00:38:06,769 --> 00:38:08,684
I can't even sit here.

1043

ashamed of yourself, madam.

- [Female] Kiss my fat (bleep) okay.

1048
00:38:18,858 --> 00:38:21,083
- Looking at these videos,
you have to ask yourself

1049
00:38:21,083 --> 00:38:23,916
what drives people to such hatred?

1050
00:38:25,048 --> 00:38:27,541
Norma, the woman who
recorded that viral video

1051
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:29,945
of her seat mate publicly fat shaming her,

1052
00:38:29,945 --> 00:38:31,150
joins me now.

1053
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:33,028
First off, thank you
for coming to the show.

1054
00:38:33,028 --> 00:38:34,868
- Oh thank you for having me, Dr. Oz.

1055
00:38:34,868 --> 00:38:36,293
- Let's go back to what happened

1056
00:38:36,293 --> 00:38:38,787
when you first got to your seat.

1057
00:38:38,787 --> 00:38:42,345
- Getting comfortable,
seated at the window seat,

1058
00:38:42,345 --> 00:38:44,942
realizing that this woman
that was coming into

1059
00:38:44,942 --> 00:38:47,691
the middle seat was having a bad day.

1060
00:38:47,691 --> 00:38:49,858
She wasn't a happy person.

1061
00:38:50,965 --> 00:38:53,548
Verbally saying negative things

1062
00:38:54,509 --> 00:38:57,105
and making it a little uncomfortable.

1063
00:38:57,105 --> 00:38:59,494
- And how did it make you feel when you

1064
00:38:59,494 --> 00:39:01,970
appreciated what she
was really getting at?

1065
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:05,637
- Uncomfortable, angry,
angrier, and madder.

1066
00:39:11,625 --> 00:39:14,507
That's why I started doing the, you know,

1067
00:39:14,507 --> 00:39:17,071
with her outbursts, I decided
to go ahead and do the video.

1068
00:39:17,071 --> 00:39:19,424
- And she kept going
even with you recording.

1069
00:39:19,424 --> 00:39:20,257
- Yes.

1070
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:22,236
And she knew I was recording.

1071
00:39:22,236 --> 00:39:24,448
- So what prompted you to wanna post it?

1072
00:39:24,448 --> 00:39:25,922
Because it does put you at risk too.

1073
00:39:25,922 --> 00:39:28,451
The whole thing is so embarrassing.

1074
00:39:28,451 --> 00:39:31,334
Of course for her, because
she's doing all this stuff.

1075
00:39:31,334 --> 00:39:35,973
- I guess because as a
nurse and I have a platform,

1076
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:38,692
that I thought that
bullying and body shaming

1077
00:39:38,692 --> 00:39:41,393
is an unacceptable behavior for children

1078
00:39:41,393 --> 00:39:43,189
and even more so for adults.

1079
00:39:43,189 --> 00:39:46,109
So I felt the need to actually show this

1080
00:39:46,109 --> 00:39:48,540
happening to me.
(audience applause)

1081
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,873
- Good for you.

1082
00:39:49,873 --> 00:39:51,842
A lot of people would have just pretended

1083
00:39:51,842 --> 00:39:53,874
it never happened and
then it gets tolerated.

1084
00:39:53,874 --> 00:39:56,610
You travel a lot, have
you ever been publicly,

1085
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:59,439
an attempt made to publicly
shame you like this?

1086
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:02,428
- 15 years on the road and
this was truly a first.

1087
00:40:02,428 --> 00:40:04,497
I'm on the road almost every week

1088
00:40:04,497 --> 00:40:06,293
and this was a first.

1089
00:40:06,293 --> 00:40:09,777
- And you probably, you
must have at some point

1090
00:40:09,777 --> 00:40:11,920
been disbelieving this was even happening.

1091
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,740
- I did, there was a delay.

1092
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:17,105
But when somebody attacks
you in you're in public,

1093
00:40:17,105 --> 00:40:19,073
you can get up and walk away.

1094
00:40:19,073 --> 00:40:21,693
You're in a plane, there's
no place to walk to.

1095
00:40:21,693 --> 00:40:23,323
You're a confined space.

1096
00:40:23,323 --> 00:40:25,089
- In fact, maybe that's the reason,

1097
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,044
but the airline ultimately kicked her off.

1098
00:40:27,044 --> 00:40:29,365
What was the reason they
gave for doing that?

1099
00:40:29,365 --> 00:40:31,822
- Well they were saying
that there were so many

1100
00:40:31,822 --> 00:40:34,450
people that were
complaining, besides myself.

1101
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:37,300
When I got off the plane
there were people behind me,

1102
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,190
when we got off the plane in Newark,

1103
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:41,638
that told me that her behavior
after I stopped video taping

1104
00:40:41,638 --> 00:40:43,807
was she was still ranting back there.

1105
00:40:43,807 --> 00:40:45,853
So the airline had to
take her off the plane

1106
00:40:45,853 --> 00:40:47,741
for the safety of all of the passengers.

1107
00:40:47,741 --> 00:40:50,196
- So we reached out to the
airline, it was United Airlines,

1108
00:40:50,196 --> 00:40:52,142
and here's what they had
to say about the incident.

1109
00:40:52,142 --> 00:40:53,750
United flight attendants
care about the safety

1110
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,436
and wellbeing of all of our customers,

1111
00:40:55,436 --> 00:40:57,128
which is why they acted quickly to find

1112
00:40:57,128 --> 00:40:58,879
a different seat for
the disruptive customer.

1113
00:40:58,879 --> 00:41:00,983
When it became clear that
this passenger's behavior

1114
00:41:00,983 --> 00:41:03,197
was likely to be
problematic on this flight,

1115
00:41:03,197 --> 00:41:05,862
she was provided alternative
travel arrangements

1116
00:41:05,862 --> 00:41:07,724
first thing the next morning.

1117
00:41:07,724 --> 00:41:10,466
So, she spent the night
wherever you were coming from.

1118
00:41:10,466 --> 00:41:11,999
Looking back on that tape,

1119
00:41:11,999 --> 00:41:14,404
why do you think that woman was so angry?

1120
00:41:14,404 --> 00:41:17,686
- I don't think I'll ever
know why she behaved that way,

1121
00:41:17,686 --> 00:41:21,769
and why she thought that
was acceptable behavior.

1122
00:41:22,635 --> 00:41:26,702
- Well, your brave desire
to share that experience

1123
00:41:26,702 --> 00:41:30,354
resulted in a video that
attracted 600,000 views

1124
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:31,930
within a few weeks.

1125
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:33,642
If you could talk to that woman,

1126
00:41:33,642 --> 00:41:34,834
and there's a pretty good chance

1127
00:41:34,834 --> 00:41:36,571
she might be watching this broadcast,

1128
00:41:36,571 --> 00:41:38,571
what would you tell her?

1129
00:41:40,305 --> 00:41:41,138
- Um,

1130
00:41:42,788 --> 00:41:44,744
she needs to be healed.

1131
00:41:44,744 --> 00:41:48,002
She needs to look inside and determine

1132
00:41:48,002 --> 00:41:50,085
why she behaved that way.

1133
00:41:51,012 --> 00:41:53,942
What is hurting inside herself that makes

1134
00:41:53,942 --> 00:41:56,089
her think it's okay to hurt other people?

1135
00:41:56,089 --> 00:41:57,582
Hurt people hurt people.

1136
00:41:57,582 --> 00:41:59,298
- [Dr. Oz] Yes, hurt people hurt people.

1137
00:41:59,298 --> 00:42:00,131
- Hurt people.

1138
00:42:00,131 --> 00:42:02,729
And she needs to understand
why she did what she did.

1139
00:42:02,729 --> 00:42:04,913
I am on the path of forgiving her,

1140
00:42:04,913 --> 00:42:08,097
because as a woman of god that is my job,

1141
00:42:08,097 --> 00:42:11,564
to forgive, and move forward.
(audience applause)

1142
00:42:11,564 --> 00:42:13,704
This is a teachable moment,

1143
00:42:13,704 --> 00:42:15,485
which is why I agreed to come on,

1144
00:42:15,485 --> 00:42:17,411
because this is a teachable moment.

1145
00:42:17,411 --> 00:42:18,958
I would like to take a quick moment

1146
00:42:18,958 --> 00:42:22,597
just to apologize to the
United flight attendants,

1147
00:42:22,597 --> 00:42:25,421
because they did an amazing job,

1148
00:42:25,421 --> 00:42:28,070
but for my language that
I used in the video,

1149
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:30,423
to tell them I'm sorry
for using that language

1150
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:33,799
at them when I was referring
to the other woman.

1151
00:42:33,799 --> 00:42:36,217
- I don't think you have
to apologize for that.

1152
00:42:36,217 --> 00:42:38,444
God bless you.
(audience applause)

1153
00:42:38,444 --> 00:42:41,960
Coming up, where's the line
between fat shaming and concern?

1154
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,963
What should you do if you feel like

1155
00:42:43,963 --> 00:42:45,968
your doctor is fat shaming you?

1156
00:42:45,968 --> 00:42:47,205
Stick around.

1157
00:42:47,205 --> 00:42:50,613
(upbeat music)

1158
00:42:50,613 --> 00:42:53,561
Shocking update on the house of horrors.

1159
00:42:53,561 --> 00:42:55,952
Why would parents torture
their own children?

1160
00:42:55,952 --> 00:42:57,720
Louise Turpin's sister reveals

1161
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,650
their intimate prison conversations.

1162
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:01,138
Any expression of remorse?

1202
00:44:15,748 --> 00:44:17,407
and a high risk for fracture,

1203
00:44:17,407 --> 00:44:20,248
now might not be the
best time to ask yourself

1204
00:44:20,248 --> 00:44:21,886
are my bones strong?

1205
00:44:21,886 --> 00:44:23,934
Life's full of make or break moments.

1206
00:44:23,934 --> 00:44:26,031
That's why it's so important to help

1207
00:44:26,031 --> 00:44:28,591
reduce your risk of fracture with Prolia.

1208
00:44:28,591 --> 00:44:31,454
Only Prolia is proven to help strengthen

1209
00:44:31,454 --> 00:44:33,411
and protect bones from fracture

1210
00:44:33,411 --> 00:44:35,185
with one shot every six months.

1211
00:44:35,185 --> 00:44:37,008
- [Announcer] Do not
take Prolia if you have

1212
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:38,670
low blood calcium, are pregnant,

1213
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:40,188
are allergic to it, or take Xgeva.

1214
00:44:40,188 --> 00:44:42,475
Serious allergic reaction
like low blood pressure,

1215
00:44:42,475 --> 00:44:44,325
trouble breathing, throat tightness,

1216
00:44:44,325 --> 00:44:46,060
face, lip or tongue swelling, rash,

1217
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:47,754
itching or hives, have happened.

1218
00:44:47,754 --> 00:44:49,437
Tell your doctor about dental problems,

1219
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:51,310
as severe jaw bone problems may happen,

1220
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:53,755
or new or unusual pain in
your hip, groin or thigh,

1221
00:44:53,755 --> 00:44:55,845
as unusual thigh bone
fractures have occurred.

1222
00:44:55,845 --> 00:44:57,816
Speak to your doctor
before stopping Prolia,

1223
00:44:57,816 --> 00:44:59,975
as spine and other bone
fractures have occurred.

1224
00:44:59,975 --> 00:45:01,921
Prolia can cause serious side effects,

1225
00:45:01,921 --> 00:45:04,024
like low blood calcium,
serious infections,

1226
00:45:04,024 --> 00:45:05,770
which could need hospitalization.

1227
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:08,305
Skin problems and severe
bone, joint or muscle pain.

1228
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:10,459
- [Announcer] Are you ready?

1229
00:45:10,459 --> 00:45:13,334
Ask your doctor how Prolia can
help strengthen your bones.

1230
00:45:13,334 --> 00:45:15,288
- With so many nourishing shades,

1231
00:45:15,288 --> 00:45:17,008
a color change is easy.

1232
00:45:17,008 --> 00:45:19,494
Nutrisse has 77, from our darkest blacks

1233
00:45:19,494 --> 00:45:20,831
to our lightest blondes.

1234
00:45:20,831 --> 00:45:22,473
It nourishes while it colors.

1235
00:45:22,473 --> 00:45:23,986
Plus avocado, olive and shea.

1236
00:45:23,986 --> 00:45:25,673
Change a little, or a lot.

1237
00:45:25,673 --> 00:45:27,549
Nutrisse, nourished hair, better color.

1238
00:45:27,549 --> 00:45:28,969
By Garnier, naturally.

1239
00:45:28,969 --> 00:45:31,596
- Unfortunately I was fat
shamed a few years ago.

1240
00:45:31,596 --> 00:45:34,194
I went to the doctor after a car accident

1241
00:45:34,194 --> 00:45:36,392
and he was supposed to
do some work on my back.

1242
00:45:36,392 --> 00:45:40,324
And while I was there he
told me that I, at the time,

1243
00:45:40,324 --> 00:45:43,374
I was 100 pound, almost 100
pounds heavier than I am now.

1244
00:45:43,374 --> 00:45:45,572
And he told me I should just go ahead

1245
00:45:45,572 --> 00:45:47,195
and have bariatric surgery done

1246
00:45:47,195 --> 00:45:49,328
because I was never gonna be able to lose

1247
00:45:49,328 --> 00:45:51,049
the weight naturally
and I was just gonna be

1248
00:45:51,049 --> 00:45:52,730
back in a few years asking for his help.

1249
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:54,384
- I was gaining weight like crazy,

1250
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:56,291
and I would go to my doctors for help

1251
00:45:56,291 --> 00:45:58,760
and all they ever said
was to work out harder,

1252
00:45:58,760 --> 00:45:59,903
eat better.

1253
00:45:59,903 --> 00:46:01,696
They said that I had fat genes,

1254
00:46:01,696 --> 00:46:03,464
they said I would always
have a weight problem,

1255
00:46:03,464 --> 00:46:05,804
they disregarded all of my other symptoms

1256
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:07,221
and said I was crazy.

1257
00:46:07,221 --> 00:46:09,459
And this went on for about eight years,

1258
00:46:09,459 --> 00:46:11,739
and I finally did my own research

1259
00:46:11,739 --> 00:46:13,959
and discovered I had a brain tumor,

1260
00:46:13,959 --> 00:46:16,422
and that was causing
all of my weight gain.

1261
00:46:16,422 --> 00:46:18,452
And a year ago I had brain surgery,

1262
00:46:18,452 --> 00:46:20,192
I had the tumor removed,

1263
00:46:20,192 --> 00:46:22,308
since then I've lost 40 pounds.

1264
00:46:22,308 --> 00:46:23,944
(audience applause)

1265
00:46:23,944 --> 00:46:26,420
- We're back with our
investigation into fat shaming.

1266
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:28,963
Could you be fat shamed
by your own doctor?

1267
00:46:28,963 --> 00:46:31,244
Where's the line between
concern about weight

1268
00:46:31,244 --> 00:46:32,398
and fat shaming?

1269
00:46:32,398 --> 00:46:33,912
Dr. Jennifer Corton joins us now,

1270
00:46:33,912 --> 00:46:35,877
we are hearing more and more stories

1271
00:46:35,877 --> 00:46:38,436
of patients they were fat
shamed by their doctor.

1272
00:46:38,436 --> 00:46:40,007
Why is their an increase?

1273
00:46:40,007 --> 00:46:42,453
- Well first of all,
this, it breaks my heart.

1274
00:46:42,453 --> 00:46:44,710
This absolutely breaks my
heart as a family doctor

1275
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:47,043
to think of, to hear, and
I'll be honest with you,

1276
00:46:47,043 --> 00:46:49,654
you know, we're doctors,
I'm not entirely surprised,

1277
00:46:49,654 --> 00:46:51,325
and I don't actually think this is new.

1278
00:46:51,325 --> 00:46:53,374
I think we're hearing about it more now

1279
00:46:53,374 --> 00:46:55,455
because people are
willing to talk about it,

1280
00:46:55,455 --> 00:46:56,765
we're willing to record it,

1281
00:46:56,765 --> 00:46:58,059
we're willing to have conversations.

1282
00:46:58,059 --> 00:47:00,786
And things like social
media has really opened up

1283
00:47:00,786 --> 00:47:02,814
the platform to really share our stories

1284
00:47:02,814 --> 00:47:04,942
and compare experiences.

1285
00:47:04,942 --> 00:47:06,916
- So give us some advice,
give the average person

1286
00:47:06,916 --> 00:47:08,718
watching some advice as a physician.

1287
00:47:08,718 --> 00:47:10,516
How do you know if you're doctors just,

1288
00:47:10,516 --> 00:47:12,782
you know, doing his best,
or crossing the line--

1289
00:47:12,782 --> 00:47:13,975
- Yeah, into the shaming.

1290
00:47:13,975 --> 00:47:14,909
- Into the shaming area.

1291
00:47:14,909 --> 00:47:16,296
- Yeah you know this is what I always say,

1292
00:47:16,296 --> 00:47:18,488
I say trust your gut.

1293
00:47:18,488 --> 00:47:21,452
If it doesn't feel right,
if you don't feel right,

1294
00:47:21,452 --> 00:47:23,426
if you feel shamed or humiliated

1295
00:47:23,426 --> 00:47:25,943
or criticized or
embarrassed, you know what,

1296
00:47:25,943 --> 00:47:29,300
believe yourself, believe
exactly how you feel.

1297
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:32,436
And a doctor wanting to do the right thing

1298
00:47:32,436 --> 00:47:35,776
does not excuse making a
patient feel any of those ways.

1299
00:47:35,776 --> 00:47:37,194
That's never okay.

1300
00:47:37,194 --> 00:47:39,707
And I say as a doctor,
and we're both doctors,

1301
00:47:39,707 --> 00:47:41,323
but I'll say, if you have a doctor that

1302
00:47:41,323 --> 00:47:42,743
makes you feel that way
or you're not comfortable,

1303
00:47:42,743 --> 00:47:45,638
I'm giving you permission
right now to find a new one.

1304
00:47:45,638 --> 00:47:47,301
- Let's give you some numbers on this.

1305
00:47:47,301 --> 00:47:50,335
Studies have found, hallelujah,
that overweight woman

1306
00:47:50,335 --> 00:47:53,141
are less likely than average
to get preventative care

1307
00:47:53,141 --> 00:47:56,169
like pelvic exams and
breast exams and mammograms.

1308
00:47:56,169 --> 00:47:57,673
There's no excuse for this.

1309
00:47:57,673 --> 00:48:00,689
But people treat overweight
people differently.

1310
00:48:00,689 --> 00:48:02,606
What is the right way for a physician

1311
00:48:02,606 --> 00:48:04,569
to address a patient's
weight do you think?

1312
00:48:04,569 --> 00:48:05,916
- Well I think there are a few things,

1313
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:06,942
and first of all, as physicians,

1314
00:48:06,942 --> 00:48:08,173
we've gotta be talking about this.

1315
00:48:08,173 --> 00:48:10,739
These are discriminatory
practices, it's wrong,

1316
00:48:10,739 --> 00:48:13,069
we have to talk about it
and be very cognizant of it.

1317
00:48:13,069 --> 00:48:15,919
But as physicians, we need
to talk with our patients.

1318
00:48:15,919 --> 00:48:17,818
That's not talk at but talk to.

1319
00:48:17,818 --> 00:48:20,083
We need to ask our patients questions.

1320
00:48:20,083 --> 00:48:21,273
What's your journey?

1321
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:22,332
How do you feel about your weight?

1322
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:24,687
Tell me what you've bee
doing, what you've tried,

1323
00:48:24,687 --> 00:48:25,797
what your story is.

1324
00:48:25,797 --> 00:48:27,340
Asking questions is key.

1325
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:29,150
And something that we've also talked about

1326
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:31,485
is this idea of never
dismissing a patient's symptoms

1327
00:48:31,485 --> 00:48:33,053
just because of their weight.

1328
00:48:33,053 --> 00:48:34,960
We shouldn't dismiss patient's symptoms

1329
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,553
because of anything, anything.

1330
00:48:36,553 --> 00:48:38,772
We should always be
doing our due diligence.

1331
00:48:38,772 --> 00:48:41,068
So this idea of saying
oh it's your weight,

1332
00:48:41,068 --> 00:48:43,853
just offhand, never okay in my opinion.

1333
00:48:43,853 --> 00:48:46,100
And the last thing is,
and this is something

1334
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:47,377
a little bit different, you know,

1335
00:48:47,377 --> 00:48:49,234
I think in the doctor's
office, I'm a family doctor,

1336
00:48:49,234 --> 00:48:51,052
and do I take someone's blood pressure

1337
00:48:51,052 --> 00:48:52,474
out in a public space?

1338
00:48:52,474 --> 00:48:54,408
Or do I take their pulse
or their temperature?

1339
00:48:54,408 --> 00:48:55,489
No, never.

1340
00:48:55,489 --> 00:48:57,600
But sometimes in doctors offices people

1341
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:00,380
are weighed in public
places, either in the hallway

1342
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:02,309
or in waiting rooms or things like that.

1343
00:49:02,309 --> 00:49:04,710
And my thing is all of
this should be private.

1344
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:06,999
This is our personal,
protected information.

1345
00:49:06,999 --> 00:49:08,765
It's no one else's business.

1346
00:49:08,765 --> 00:49:11,177
So there are things as
doctors that we can do better

1347
00:49:11,177 --> 00:49:13,875
to make this a more comfortable
and appropriate situation.

1348
00:49:13,875 --> 00:49:15,703
- Yeah you gotta feel
comfortable insisting that,

1349
00:49:15,703 --> 00:49:17,351
for example, you're weighed in private,

1350
00:49:17,351 --> 00:49:18,513
'cause I don't want you
not going to a doctor

1351
00:49:18,513 --> 00:49:19,615
'cause you're worried about it.

1352
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:21,179
Weight's uncomfortable, I know.

1353
00:49:21,179 --> 00:49:22,596
That's true for a lot of us.

1354
00:49:22,596 --> 00:49:23,913
But it's a necessary topic.

1355
00:49:23,913 --> 00:49:25,897
So make sure you're
talking about the doctor,

1356
00:49:25,897 --> 00:49:28,277
not at but with, folks
as you care about it.

1357
00:49:28,277 --> 00:49:30,959
I wanna bring in Norma, the
nurse who we met earlier,

1358
00:49:30,959 --> 00:49:33,003
who was on the plane
and being bullied for...

1359
00:49:33,003 --> 00:49:35,105
Come on up, Norma.
(audience applause)

1360
00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:37,540
Norma, what's the best way, do you think,

1361
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:41,036
a patient should be able
to address their doctor,

1362
00:49:41,036 --> 00:49:43,253
if they're worried about weight issues?

1363
00:49:43,253 --> 00:49:46,617
- Letting the doctor
know this is new to me,

1364
00:49:46,617 --> 00:49:48,512
this is an unusual feeling.

1365
00:49:48,512 --> 00:49:52,493
I've been feeling like this
for two weeks or two months,

1366
00:49:52,493 --> 00:49:54,105
putting a timeframe to it.

1367
00:49:54,105 --> 00:49:57,241
And if the doctor's still
not listening to you,

1368
00:49:57,241 --> 00:49:58,458
change doctors.

1369
00:49:58,458 --> 00:49:59,746
Always get a second opinion.

1370
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:01,751
Always get a second opinion.
(audience applause)

1371
00:50:01,751 --> 00:50:03,292
- Thank you very much.

1372
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:04,125
- Thank you.

1373
00:50:04,125 --> 00:50:05,752
- As always, we'll be right back.

1374
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:08,335
(upbeat music)

1375
00:50:09,758 --> 00:50:11,523
I love getting to talk with you on my show

1376
00:50:11,523 --> 00:50:12,846
every single day.

1377
00:50:12,846 --> 00:50:14,707
But when the cameras stop rolling,

1378
00:50:14,707 --> 00:50:16,771
the conversation is not over.

1379
00:50:16,771 --> 00:50:18,897
I still have a lot that
I wanna talk about.

1380
00:50:18,897 --> 00:50:22,177
So download the Dr. Oz
podcast on Apple Podcasts,

1381

or wherever you get your podcasts.

1382
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:27,139
- I would get muscle
cramps several times a week

1383
00:50:27,139 --> 00:50:28,239
for decades.

1384
00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:31,327
Using Theraworx Relief,
the cramps are gone.

- [Female] Starting a business means

1388
00:50:36,103 --> 00:50:38,302
I have to be well rested
every night of the month.

1389
00:50:38,302 --> 00:50:39,880
- [Announcer] Always overnight pads have

1390
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,377
up to a two times larger back,

1391
00:50:41,377 --> 00:50:42,846
for up to 10 hours of protection.

1392
00:50:42,846 --> 00:50:45,150
It catches leaks so you can catch Zs.

1393
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:48,422
- [Female] Because my morning
starts before morning starts.

- [Announcer] Always.

1395
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,501
- [Announcer] This has potassium.

1396
00:50:52,501 --> 00:50:54,677
The same amount as this.

1397
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:58,894
It's a post workout snack
you don't have to peal.

1398
00:50:58,894 --> 00:51:01,463
V8, the V is for vegetables.

1399

Drink some.

rouge natural sunset matte lip stain.

1402
00:51:09,178 --> 00:51:10,741
Eight new warm shades.

1403
00:51:10,741 --> 00:51:13,436
Less texture, more colors, more Paris.

1404
00:51:13,436 --> 00:51:15,780
All day matte bare lip sensation.

1405
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:18,662
Rouge natural sunset, by L'Oreal Paris.

- [Female] We're worth it.

1407

- [Announcer] What might
seem like a small cough

1408
00:51:21,692 --> 00:51:24,001
can be a big bad problem
for your grandchildren.

1409
00:51:24,001 --> 00:51:26,412
Babies too young to be
vaccinated against whooping cough

1410
00:51:26,412 --> 00:51:28,395
are the most at risk for severe illness.

1411

Help prevent this, talk to
your doctor or pharmacist today

about getting vaccinated
against whooping cough.

1413
00:51:34,352 --> 00:51:36,925
- Set your eyes on my latest game changer,

1414
00:51:36,925 --> 00:51:40,124
a world famous Bob-O-Pedic
queen mattress for only 299.

1415
00:51:40,124 --> 00:51:41,584
With all the quality and comfort

1416
00:51:41,584 --> 00:51:42,938
of its more expensive cousins,

1417
00:51:42,938 --> 00:51:44,755
it's really a little gem of a mattress,

1418
00:51:44,755 --> 00:51:46,865
so that's what we called
it, the Bob-O-Pedic gem.

1419
00:51:46,865 --> 00:51:49,589
- [Group] At Bob's Discount.

1420
00:51:49,589 --> 00:51:52,674
- Lifeguards not properly
trained or doing their jobs.

1421
00:51:52,674 --> 00:51:56,108
Pool areas that aren't
properly gated or up to code.

1422
00:51:56,108 --> 00:51:59,054
We trust that the pools
our families use to swim

1423
00:51:59,054 --> 00:52:00,455
are safe and secure.

1424
00:52:00,455 --> 00:52:02,791
But when a management or lifeguard company

1425
00:52:02,791 --> 00:52:05,645
fails to comply with
pool safety regulations,

1426
00:52:05,645 --> 00:52:07,573
tragedy can occur.

1427
00:52:07,573 --> 00:52:09,942
I'm attorney David Haynes
of The Cochran Firm.

1428

to someone else's negligence,

1429
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:14,698

00:52:58,553 --> 00:53:00,241

1447
00:53:00,241 --> 00:53:02,336
- [Group] Get Bob's Discount.

1448
00:53:02,336 --> 00:53:04,567
- [Announcer] Only at
Bob's Discount Furniture.

1449
00:53:04,567 --> 00:53:09,172
(audience applause)
(upbeat music)

1450
00:53:09,172 --> 00:53:10,420
- It's a big day!

1451
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:12,273
I'm excited to announce the launch

1452
00:53:12,273 --> 00:53:14,030
of my all new Oz Guide.

1453
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:17,042
They're new quarterly
single topic mini zines,

1454
00:53:17,042 --> 00:53:19,295
little magazines, cute little things,

1455
00:53:19,295 --> 00:53:21,131
that will tackle some of
your biggest health problems.

1456
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:23,530
Our very first issue will
be on the news stands

1457
00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:26,093
and at supermarket checkout
counters later this month.

1458
00:53:26,093 --> 00:53:28,221
It's an Oz approved plan featuring

1459
00:53:28,221 --> 00:53:32,607
the healthiest fats
around, which are MUFAs.

1460
00:53:32,607 --> 00:53:37,606
'Cause you know, MUFAs are
monounsaturated fatty acids.

1461
00:53:37,606 --> 00:53:40,146
They're plant based fats so the
easiest way to remember them

1462
00:53:40,146 --> 00:53:43,285
is to look for healthy fats
that aren't from animal sources,

1463
00:53:43,285 --> 00:53:45,087
such as avocados.

1464
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:46,868
Come bouncing down.

1465
00:53:46,868 --> 00:53:49,789
Or, you know what also
counts, nuts and seeds.

1466
00:53:49,789 --> 00:53:51,193
They can really fill you up.

1467
00:53:51,193 --> 00:53:52,173
(audience applause)

1468
00:53:52,173 --> 00:53:54,140
And one of my favorites, olives.

1469
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:55,722
(audience applause)

1470
00:53:55,722 --> 00:53:56,971
Black and green.

1471
00:53:56,971 --> 00:53:58,992
So there was a study done through

1472
00:53:58,992 --> 00:54:00,645
the American Diabetic Association,

1473
00:54:00,645 --> 00:54:02,499
that found that a diet rich in MUFAs

1474
00:54:02,499 --> 00:54:04,522
works to actually reduce belly fat.

1475
00:54:04,522 --> 00:54:05,654
It's a big deal.

1476
00:54:05,654 --> 00:54:07,148
But you don't wanna want...

1477
00:54:07,148 --> 00:54:09,405
We don't really want these
foods getting boring.

1478
00:54:09,405 --> 00:54:11,067
All right, that's the problem.

1479
00:54:11,067 --> 00:54:12,906
I know, I know, you're thinking that.

1480
00:54:12,906 --> 00:54:17,859
So I've been hearing reports
of nuts and seeds fatigue.

1481
00:54:17,859 --> 00:54:19,320
Shy away from this problem.

1482
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:21,611
And then there's avocado apathy.

1483
00:54:21,611 --> 00:54:22,909
Nobody wants that.

1484
00:54:22,909 --> 00:54:24,087
Making headlines.

1485
00:54:24,087 --> 00:54:26,131
And then of course olive monotony.

1486
00:54:26,131 --> 00:54:28,160
One of the worst problems to run into.

1487
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:31,318
So I have challenged
three Bite Club members

1488
00:54:31,318 --> 00:54:33,999
to come up with new MUFA-licious recipes,

1489
00:54:33,999 --> 00:54:36,336
in my first ever MUFA awards.

1490
00:54:36,336 --> 00:54:37,962
This is a very serious competition.

1491
00:54:37,962 --> 00:54:40,545
(upbeat music)

1492
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:45,747
We have spared no expense as you can tell.

1493
00:54:45,747 --> 00:54:47,576
I hope you're impressed by that.

1494
00:54:47,576 --> 00:54:49,628
The MUFA awards, the
inaugural launch here,

1495
00:54:49,628 --> 00:54:51,692
the dishes were judged
by a team of tasters

1496
00:54:51,692 --> 00:54:54,545
who are harsh people, tend to
be sour and dour in nature.

1497
00:54:54,545 --> 00:54:56,374
So I'll present their reports to you.

1498
00:54:56,374 --> 00:54:58,362
Prior to the show they
tasted all these foods.

1499
00:54:58,362 --> 00:55:01,238
The winner will take home
our coveted golden avocado.

1500
00:55:01,238 --> 00:55:03,821
(upbeat music)

1501
00:55:08,974 --> 00:55:11,158
So I'm excited to hear
what they have made.

1502
00:55:11,158 --> 00:55:13,640
Jenny came up with a new
way to use nuts and seeds.

1503
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:14,849
What did you make?

1504
00:55:14,849 --> 00:55:16,599
- So I made a burger.

1505
00:55:17,698 --> 00:55:22,198
I combined macadamia nuts,
almonds, cashews and pecans

1506
00:55:23,388 --> 00:55:25,129
with a lot of seeds.

1507
00:55:25,129 --> 00:55:28,462
Pumpkin seeds, hemp seeds, sesame seeds,

1508
00:55:29,685 --> 00:55:32,185
and quinoa, mushrooms, olives.

1509
00:55:33,787 --> 00:55:35,246
And there you go.

1510
00:55:35,246 --> 00:55:37,166
- You know it could have
been dry but it's not.

1511
00:55:37,166 --> 00:55:38,148
Very fulfilling.

1512
00:55:38,148 --> 00:55:39,921
Tastes meaty without the meat.

1513
00:55:39,921 --> 00:55:41,226
And rich in MUFAs as you described.

1514
00:55:41,226 --> 00:55:42,059
Nicely done.

1515
00:55:42,059 --> 00:55:42,892
- [Jenny] Thank you.

1516
00:55:42,892 --> 00:55:44,048
- All right, next up.

1517
00:55:44,048 --> 00:55:44,910
(audience applause)

1518
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:47,684
Roberta came up with a next
level way to use avocados.

1519
00:55:47,684 --> 00:55:48,686
What did you do?

1520
00:55:48,686 --> 00:55:49,920
You have a sweet tooth don't you?

1521
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:50,891
- I do.

1522
00:55:50,891 --> 00:55:52,716
Secret agent chocolate pudding.

1523
00:55:52,716 --> 00:55:54,285
- Very clever, diabolical.

1524
00:55:54,285 --> 00:55:55,364
- You know why?

1525
00:55:55,364 --> 00:55:56,197
- [Dr. Oz] Why?

1526
00:55:56,197 --> 00:55:58,335
- [Roberta] 'Cause our
avocado is the secret agent.

1527
00:55:58,335 --> 00:55:59,550
- It's a good name.

1528
00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:00,911
- Now this goes great with wine.

1529
00:56:00,911 --> 00:56:02,610
Sorry, I just had to
throw the wine in there.

1530
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:03,735
- If you'd brought the wine it could have

1531
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:04,915
influenced the judges.

1532
00:56:04,915 --> 00:56:06,090
- Right, probably.

1533
00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:07,412
So decadent, so delicious.

1534
00:56:07,412 --> 00:56:09,399
You wouldn't even know
there's avocados in there.

1535
00:56:09,399 --> 00:56:11,679
- It's very thick, and
it does fill your mouth,

1536
00:56:11,679 --> 00:56:13,187
and it's very chocolatey.

1537
00:56:13,187 --> 00:56:14,193
Nice combo.

1538
00:56:14,193 --> 00:56:16,169
And this is a very strong
competitor tonight.

1539
00:56:16,169 --> 00:56:17,150
But yours was too.

1540
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:19,316
But, before we judge, thank
you very much, Roberta.

1541
00:56:19,316 --> 00:56:20,324
- You're welcome.

1542
00:56:20,324 --> 00:56:21,162
- We have Paula.
(audience applause)

1543
00:56:21,162 --> 00:56:22,191
Paula what do you have here?

1544
00:56:22,191 --> 00:56:23,875
You have an olive looking item here.

1545
00:56:23,875 --> 00:56:27,125
- So we have tahini filled hummus,

1546
00:56:27,125 --> 00:56:29,108
and these are actually
gluten free crackers

1547
00:56:29,108 --> 00:56:30,581
that are made from all those seeds

1548
00:56:30,581 --> 00:56:32,102
that just feel from the sky over there.

1549
00:56:32,102 --> 00:56:33,137
You love green olives.

1550
00:56:33,137 --> 00:56:33,970
- I do.

1551
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:34,803
- Delicious.

1552
00:56:34,803 --> 00:56:35,636
And a lot of people eat...

1553
00:56:35,636 --> 00:56:36,542
Who eats hummus?

1554
00:56:36,542 --> 00:56:37,683
Everyone eats hummus, right?

1555
00:56:37,683 --> 00:56:38,531
- I love hummus.

1556
00:56:38,531 --> 00:56:39,955
- So I lightened the
hummus up a little bit

1557
00:56:39,955 --> 00:56:42,098
by adding some cauliflowers so it lowers--

1558
00:56:42,098 --> 00:56:43,080
- You did?

1559
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,993
- Yeah, it lowers the calorie count.

1560
00:56:44,993 --> 00:56:46,563
You can't tell the difference.

1561
00:56:46,563 --> 00:56:47,419
- No.

1562
00:56:47,419 --> 00:56:49,135
- And then also this is a daikon radish.

1563
00:56:49,135 --> 00:56:51,544
This is a carrot, 46 calories.

1564
00:56:51,544 --> 00:56:52,513
10 calories.

1565
00:56:52,513 --> 00:56:54,543
If you need a vehicle to get
the hummus in your mouth,

1566
00:56:54,543 --> 00:56:55,525
try a daikon.

1567
00:56:55,525 --> 00:56:56,702
- Gimme that daikon.

1568
00:56:56,702 --> 00:56:57,670
I like this idea.

1569
00:56:57,670 --> 00:56:59,048
You put a lot of garlic in this,

1570
00:56:59,048 --> 00:57:00,199
I'm very proud of you.

1571
00:57:00,199 --> 00:57:01,180
- I did.

1572
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:02,364
It's delicious isn't it?

1573
00:57:02,364 --> 00:57:03,568
So flat belly hummus.
- Speaks to my heart.

1574
00:57:03,568 --> 00:57:05,218
- All of these you will lose weight with

1575
00:57:05,218 --> 00:57:06,723
if you eat them the right way.

1576
00:57:06,723 --> 00:57:08,479
(audience applause)

1577
00:57:08,479 --> 00:57:10,970
But, I have the unfortunate
and difficult task

1578
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:12,687
of revealing the winner.

1579
00:57:12,687 --> 00:57:13,834
Are we ready for this?

1580
00:57:13,834 --> 00:57:14,852
No hard feelings.

1581
00:57:14,852 --> 00:57:15,931
All right.

1582
00:57:15,931 --> 00:57:18,070
So I have deliberated with the judges,

1583
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:20,570
and the first ever MUFA award,

1584
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:25,153
and the person taking home
the golden avocado today is,

1585
