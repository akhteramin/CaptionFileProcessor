- You did good, buddy. You played it right. I wouldn't have gone on. That's it! Thanks to Jan Lambourne, Emmitt Smith. He's gonna be taking Justin to a celebrity invitational golf tournament. Justin Uhart picked the case based on a fortune cookie, and he's walking out of here with $120,000. No matter what happened tonight, Justin came in a hero, he was gonna leave a hero. We'll see you next time right here on Deal or No Deal. [cheers and applause] <i> male announcer: Tonight,</i> <i> a military wife and mom</i> <i> has a dream to return home...</i> 
- You wanna go back to Michigan. 
- Bring me home! <i> announcer:</i> <i> With a million dollars!</i> 
- Yes! 
- This is bigger than ever. Each case can change your future. 
- Oh, my gosh! No deal! <i> announcer: But will she</i> <i> crack under the pressure</i> <i> of an incredible</i> <i> new game twist?</i> 
- I would like to counter-offer. 
- You just handed the game over to her. 
- She wants me gone. <i> announcer: It's an</i> <i> unbelievable ending.</i> <i> 
- How amazing is that?</i> 
- Oh, my God! <i> announcer: From Universal</i> <i> Orlando Resort,</i> <i> heart-pounding thrills and</i> <i> hair-raising adventure await.</i> <i> It's Deal or No Deal.</i> [cheers and applause] 
- Welcome, everybody! I'm Howie Mandel! I can't tell you how excited I am to be back hosting a brand-new season of Deal or No Deal, or, as I like to call it, my dream job. [laughter] It really is. I get to give away $1 million. They also let me do real cool things... like this. Ladies, please! [cheers and applause] <i> [exciting music]</i> <i> [Music] [Music]</i> Hello, ladies. 
- Hello, Howie. 
- Right back at ya. Now let's meet a brand-new player with a brand-new chance to win life-changing money-
- Courtney Schlaud! How are ya? 
- Hello! How are you, Howie? 
- Welcome to Deal or No Deal. 
- Thank you! [screaming] 
- They love you. Tell me a little bit about yourself. 
- My name's Courtney Schlaud. 
- Right. 
- I'm originally from Owosso, Michigan, and I miss Michigan so much! 
- Oh, you don't live there now? 
- I do not live there now. We're currently living in Southern California with my daughter Payton, who's five. My husband's in the Marine Corps. I cannot wait to move back to Michigan after he retires, and I actually have a snow shovel of hope in our garage right now still. 
- Wait, wait, wait, wait. A snow shovel of hope? 
- Yeah. 
- Because you miss snow? 
- I miss it! It's hot and dry! 
- Right. [laughs] I love it. I was born in Canada, and I don't have to shovel driveways. I love that you're hoping to get back into the snow. That's so different. 
- Yes! Yes. 
- But I love that. I wanna know if you won a million dollars, what would you do? 
- Oh, my gosh. Buy a house on a lake in Michigan, be closer to my parents, namely, and my best friends are out there. 
- The Michiganers. 
- The Michiganders. 
- Michiganders? Is that what they're called? 
- Yes. 
- Are you ready? 
- I'm ready, Howie. 
- Let's go, Courtney! You a big fan of this game? 
- Huge fan! 
- Huge fan. 
- Yes. 
- All right. Well, I'm excited you're here. All right. We have 26 ladies holding 26 cases. Each of those cases is holding a different amount of money packed by a third party. We don't know what case is holding what amount. What we do know is that one of the cases is holding $1 million... all the way down to a penny. Now, all you have to do is find the case with $1 million. 
- Okay! Let's do this! 
- Pick a case. 
- I pick case number four. 
- Case number four. That's Brenda. Brenda. 
- Good luck! 
- All right. 
- There it is! 
- First of all, I wanna ask you was there a reason you chose four? 
- Yes. My birthday is on March 4th, so it's always been a lucky number. 
- Right. And this is like a big birthday party, isn't it? 
- Ah...yes! 
- Yes. This is like a birthday party. 
- Big birthday party! 
- But you can't open up your present until the party starts. And the way the party starts is we start by opening those cases. What's ever in those cases is not in yours. Let's start by opening up six cases. 
- Six cases? Right. I pick case number ten! 
- Case number ten is Vaeda. You want small amounts, because you want the big amount right here. Vaeda, open your case. 
- You got one penny in there, right? 
- 10,000. That's good. 
- That's...good! 
- All right, five more cases. 
- Okay. 
- Elissa. Open your case. 
- I'm from Canada, and sometimes I'm in L.A. and I'm like, Could use a good blizzard, you know? 
- Right. 
- Beautiful! 
- Well, then go buy yourself a shovel of hope. [laughter] Open your case. 
- Small number! Yes! 
- You made her dance. 
- Yes. 
- Four more. 
- Could I get case number...17? 
- Ashley, open your case. 
- Little! Little. Aaah! Oh, my God! 
- Can I get a name for what you're doing there? 
- Kinda a shimmy-shake. Little shimmy. 
- A shimmy-shake. 
- Shimmy goin' on. Get excited. 
- All right. Make her shimmy--three more. 
- Okay. Case number three. 
- Katie, open the case. 
- Little number. Little one. [squealing] Whoo! 
- Okay, two more cases. 
- Um...case number 24. 
- Kizzi, open your case. 
- Come on, little! <i> [bass notes]</i> 
- Ooh. [audience groans] 
- Oh, no! 
- That's a low blow. 
- It's okay! 
- That's okay. 
- It's okay. 
- Because most of the big amounts are in, but... it also includes the $1 million. Okay, one more case. 
- Summer, last case in the first round. 
- Come on, Summer! Little number. <i> [bass notes]</i> Oh! 
- It's okay, though. 
- Okay. All right. 
- I'm looking at this. Look what you did. Was there a reason for this? You like parted the white sea. [laughter] Look what you did. 
- Felt the middle a little bit. 
- The middle is gone. 
- It's gone! 
- It's gone. 
- [murmurs, sighs] 
- You know how this goes, right? Everybody here wants your birthday present to be the $1 million case. [cheers and applause] 
- Thank you! Thanks! 
- When I say everybody, I don't mean everybody. There's one person here who does not want that, and that is that young lady up there. She is our banker. [audience boos] Hello. She wants to buy that case for as cheap as possible. 
- Boo! 
- Hello. <i> [suspenseful music]</i> Okay. All right. Um, she's got an offer. But she says, Before I tell you the offer, um, she wants to fulfill a dream you have. I think this is maybe a bargaining chip for her, 'cause she wants you to leave right now. So what do you have for Courtney? I hear footsteps. 
- Ooh! <i> [suspenseful music]</i> <i> [Music] [Music]</i> Snow. [laughter] <i> [energetic rhythm]</i> [Howie chuckles] 
- Should I get on the floor and lay in it? [laughter] 
- Okay. The first offer is $16,000. 
- A lotta money. 
- It is. 
- This is Deal or No Deal 
- Sure. 
- Our little twist is you have an opportunity to counter-offer. But you can only do that once in a game. 
- All right. 
- Right. You gotta make it reasonable if you want her to take it. If she does take it, you sell her the case, and you go home. If she says No deal, the game continues. In this case, to continue the game, you have to open up another five cases. 
- Okay. 
- Courtney Schlaud, deal or no deal? 
- No deal! if you think about it, is a fair chunk of change. However, look at the game board. 
- Still great. 
- So...we're thinking no deal! 
- No deal. Courtney Schlaud, trying to make her way back to Michigan. That's what it's all about for you, right? 
- Well, my very best friend and my parents are there. Um...I was actually sick through my 20s, and I watched my parents go to work every day just to cover the insurance premiums for me to get treatment to sleep on their couch 18 hours a day. It took about six years for me to get better. I never thought I'd get married, go to school, have a baby, and...look now! [cheers and applause] 
- Wow. That's amazing. 
- I want a portion of whatever I get to go to my parents. 
- Right. Oh, that's so wonderful. 
- Yes. 
- To give back. [applause] 
- So...fingers crossed! 
- All right, five more cases to open. 
- Okay. How 'bout lucky number seven? 
- Small amount. Open the case. 
- [mouthing words] 
- That's okay. 
- That's okay. 
- That's less than the big ones before. 
- It's less than my million. 
- You got four more cases. 
- Number 14. 
- Olga, small amount! 
- The $1.00. <i> [bass notes]</i> [audience groans] That's a tough one 
- Oh, that hurt. 
- There's still a great safety net of 200,000 to $400,000. All right, three more cases. 
- All right, number 26. 
- Michelle, open your case. 
- $1.00. You've gotta have the dollar in it. Please! Oh! Sassy! Sassy. 
- She is sassy. Sassy Michelle. Two more cases. 
- Let's get sometimes unlucky 13 off the board. 
- That is Mahogany Lox. 
- Come on, girl! 
- Open your case! 
- Little, sister! 
- Ooh. 
- Eek! It's all right. It's all right. 
- All right. The million dollars is still in play. Okay? One more case. 
- All right. We'll go number one. 
- Soraya, open your case. 
- Yes! [cheers and applause] 
- All right. Here is the offer. Hello? 
- I'm ready for the weather! [laughter] 
- Okay. You think the offer went up or down? You did knock out a couple of big ones there. 
- I do believe it went up. 
- Why? 
- Because I want it to be up! [laughter, cheers] 
- You are right, and it's because the million dollars is still in play--that's why. And it went up to $26,000. The million dollars is still in play. I told you, you got a big decision here, and it's real. And you have an opportunity to counter-offer if you want. You don't have to do this alone. You brought some supporters. 
- Yes! 
- All right. Hi! 
- Hi. 
- What's your name? 
- My name is Acton. I'm a fellow Marine wife. 
- Oh, wonderful. 
- We met through our husbands. We've done every crazy thing in life that the Marine Corps can handle. We've been there together, all through it all. 
- Whoo! Yeah! 
- Okay. And you are? 
- My name is Kristika. I met Courtney in the last year. She is a great mom. Like with Payton, she turns everything into a positive. It could be bad, but she'll turn it around. She is awesome. 
- And who are you, young man? 
- How you doing? 
- I'm doing great. 
- I'm John. I married the love of my life. 
- Yeah! 
- First of all, thank you for your service. 
- Thank you for the support, Howie. She supported me through thick and thin, eight years of marriage, multiple deployments. And we're all here to support you. We're all here for your day. 
- Yeah! 
- I love you. 
- She's dreamed about this day for a long time. Happy Courtney Day! 
- Whoo! 
- Happy Courtney Day! 
- Happy Courtney Day! 
- Happy Courtney Day! You got emotional when they were talking about you. 
- Yeah. My husband has been in the Marine Corps for 20 years now. [cheers and applause] And I couldn't be more proud. I know I talk about Michigan, but he and my daughter are my home, and we're gonna go wherever he does. And we just hope to land in Michigan. 
- You support going back to Michigan, sir? 
- I do support going home to Michigan when I do retire, whenever that is. And this million dollars that's in that number four case is gonna help us. 
- Yeah! 
- All right, Courtney Schlaud, deal or no deal? 
- 26. There's three up there. No deal. No deal. [overlapping chatter] 
- We've got three big players on the board. So Mr. Howie... 
- Mrs. Courtney? [laughter] 
- No deal! 
- No deal. She's on her way to million dollars when we come back. <i> [upbeat music]</i> <i> [Music] [Music]</i> <i> announcer:</i> <i> A game-changing moment...</i>

- 23 has been lucky for me in the past. 
- 23. Anne Julia. You know, you gotta avoid the million dollars. You know what would be a beaut is $10.00. Open your case. <i> [suspenseful music]</i> 
- Yes! [cheers and applause] Yeah-ea! 
- Yeah, well. Ah. That was me doing The Shimmy. The biggest amount you knocked out of that round was $25,000. That's a good round. All the big money remained. Call us. [phone rings] [audience boos] Hello. Mm-hmm. All right. As long as the million dollars stays in play, you may shimmy, but that makes her shake. 
- Yeah! 
- Yeah! [applause] The new offer... is almost double. The new offer--$57,000. 
- Okay. That's a lot. 
- That's a lotta money. What can $57,000 do for ya? 
- I wish you knew the state of my husband's car. And he drives it just so he can put our daughter in different activities and all of that, and he sacrifices so much. 
- Would $57,000 get you back to Michigan? 
- It could, but I know it could be much more. [applause] 
- Courtney Schlaud, deal or no deal? [overlapping shouting] 
- $57,000 is a lot of money, but I think this is Courtney's Day. I think she wants to go for that million. There's a lotta other offers up there. [applause] 
- Howie...no deal! 
- No deal. Wow. 
- Three cases. Pick a case.

- Welcome back to Deal or No Deal. I'm standing right here with a Michigander, Courtney Schlaud. You had an incredible round. The last round, the most you knocked out was $750. 
- Go Courtney! 
- That was amazing! 
- You remember what your last offer was? 
- I don't. [laughter] 
- I'm gonna tell you. It was $57,000. 
- And you turned it down. You said no. 
- Yes. 
- You had a great round. You know that. There's the new offer. 
- There it is. [audience boos] [phone ringing]

- No! Which should make you happy. 
- Yeah! [audience shouting]

- There's a lot more up there waiting for me. 
- Just keep the million, and we're good. 
- You gotta open up two cases. 
- I'm... going for number 20. 
- Amanza, stay away from the big amounts. Open your case. <i> [suspenseful music]</i> <i> [Music] [Music]</i>

- Yes! Raising a child, there's all the what ifs and what you want to give to them. You don't think about yourself much. So, priorities. Always for my baby girl. 
- But more importantly, if you won a million dollars, it would definitely get you back to helping your parents, it would get you back to Michigan so you could see your best friend. 
- I miss my Amber so hard. 
- There is so much at stake. 
- Yeah. 
- And we're about to find out what all that is when we come back. <i> [Music] [Music]</i> <i> announcer:</i> <i> As Courtney's battle</i> <i> for the million continues...</i>

- Well, welcome back! It's Courtney Schlaud Day! 
- Whoo! 
- We're celebrating Courtney Schlaud Day right now with one of the most amazing boards I have ever seen. And the reason it's one of the most amazing boards I've ever seen is because you've got a 50/50 chance of walking out of here with at least $300,000. You said during the break that it feels like a dream. 
- Yes. 
- And you know, at Deal or No Deal, besides with the money, it's a show where-
- where we want your dreams to come true. And I don't know if this helps. You know, we gave you a little bit of snow. We gave you a nice little sign. 
- That's fantastic. 
- How 'bout a little taste of Michigan? Would you like that? 
- Okay... 
- All right. Here's what I'm going to do. 
- 'Kay. 
- I'm gonna tell you to look at that person... 
- Oh, my God! 
- That's Amber! That's her best friend! She had no idea that her best friend would be there. Absolutely no idea. 
- I love you so much! 
- You need to turn around. 
- What? 
- You need to turn around. 
- Oh, my God! 
- Her parents! That's her parents. 
- Stop it, stop it, stop it! [squeals] You're here! How? 
- That is her parents. That is a total surprise. 
- [chanting] Courtney Day! 
- This is your family. These are-
- This is your best friend. 
- This one has been posting stuff, making herself look busy. [laughter] Hi! [phone rings] 
- Ooh! 
- Remember... these offers are real. Real. 
- Sass her. 
- Hello. <i> [suspenseful music]</i> [chuckles] Okay. She says in terms of holidays, Courtney Day-
- not her favorite. 
- Aw, boo! 
- You're welcome! [laughter, applause] 
- Okay. 
- [whispers] Oh, my gosh. <i> [suspenseful music]</i> 
- You know what this money means. It means a lot. You've seen your daughter and your friend, your wife, and your friend-
- you've seen her turn down life-changing money. It's tough. 
- Mm-hmm. 
- Yes. 
- You're at a place in the game now where you have to open one case at a time. 
- Yeah! [cheers and applause] 
- You believe you have the million in your case? 
- My number four. My number four! 
- Do you believe it enough and feel it enough to turn down 
- One more case! 
- One more case. If you do knock out the million, you'll never get an offer that high. Mom, what would you tell your daughter to do? 
- Mama! [no sound] [laughter] 
- [high voice] What do you want? [laughter] 
- She's lost her voice. She lost her voice--because this means a lot, right? 
- Oh, yes. 
- It does. 
- And $173,000 is a huge amount of money. You have an opportunity to counter-offer. If you do counter, it's gotta be reasonable to have her accept it. If she says no deal, the game goes on, and you open up one more case. Oh, you're taking off your sweater. You're getting hot. [laughter] I might keep it on, because it's been known to snow in here. [laughter] 
- I have watched you put your life on hold to serve everyone around you. And you know what? You deserve this. Girl, you gotta get one more case out of there. 
- Courtney Schlaud... deal... or no deal? [overlapping shouting]

- All right, welcome back to Deal or No Deal for our celebration of Courtney Schlaud Day. This is the game of a lifetime. She just turned down-
- You, young lady, just turned down more than 1/4 of a million dollars, a guarantee-
- 
- Sounds so bad. 
- But it can also end up being great. 
- Is it okay that I don't feel my hands right now? 
- Yes. 
- Is that normal? 
- Uh, no, but we do have a medic. 
- I'm good. 
- All right. One case. 
- I choose... case six. 
- That's Megan. 
- Come on, sister. 
- $10 or $100 would be huge. 
- Yeah. 
- Bottom right would drop you. Open the case. [crowd commotion] <i> [suspenseful music]</i> <i> [Music] [Music]</i> 
- Oh, no! 
- Courtney! [cheers and applause] [cheers and applause] 
- [chanting] Courtney Day, Courtney Day, Courtney Day! 
- All right. 
- Courtney Day! 
- All right. It is crazy. Because now look at that board. You have a three out of four chance of having $300,000, or more, in this case. A three out of four. There are four cases left. One of them is holding $100. Is the $100 up there, or is the $100 here? This is about to get huge. It has been huge. This is bigger than ever. Are you ready for this? Are you ready? [phone rings] [audience murmurs] [ringing] Hello. 
- Courtney! 
- Gonna brace myself. 
- Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. She needs you to leave. 
- Whoa! 
- [exhales] 
- Boy. <i> [suspenseful music]</i> 
- Wait for the deal. 
- Whoo! 
- You made a $342,000 face. 
- That is so much money. 
- It is so much money. 
- But look at that stinking board. 
- Oh, girl, girl! 
- That is an amazing board, probably one of the best boards I've ever seen. That being said, $100 is still on that board. 
- Correct. 
- Which means... this could be the $100. 
- Oh... 
- It can be. Mom, how are you holding up? 
- I'm okay. 
- How you doing, Mom? [laughing] 
- How can you counter-offer? 
- Here, come here. Okay. [cheers and applause] That's the banker, and what she has to do is she has to make her an offer, but it's got to be a reasonable offer. If she takes it, she writes you that check, and you go home and you give her the case. Oh! If she says no deal, all the money's off the table, and she has to open one more case. 
- Okay. 
- You're welcome. Thank you, I'll be all-
- all night. [cheers and applause] Courtney Schlaud... you must answer this question now. Deal...or no deal? [overlapping shouting] <i> [suspenseful music]</i>

- Come on, Courtney, you got this. [laughter]

- All right, if that 100's in there, you are about to go to the stratosphere and on your way to $1 million. It all depends on this case. And this case will be opened... when we come back. 
- No! 
- Yes! Yes. <i> Reese's eggs are back</i> <i> and we hid them</i> <i> somewhere you'll never find...</i> <i> Sike!

- This is why we're sitting. My legs are weak. And this is<i> your</i> game. [groans] Oh, my God, a marine. A marine looks nervous. Look. You don't see marines that look nervous. You know what, I don't even wanna take control of this. You picked number 12. 
- Yes, sir. 
- Her name is Sarati. One case to open. There is a million dollars on the board, but there are still $100 on the board. You turned down $342,000. You know what? I don't want this on me at all, so Courtney... you tell Sarati when you want her to open the case. I'll be over there. 
- Nice job, Howie. 
- My heart is beating so fast. 
- Sarati... open the case! <i> [Music] [Music]</i> <i> [bass notes]</i> That's okay! 
- That's okay. It's 300,000. 
- Okay. Still four. 
- That's still good. 
- Great. That's great! 
- Now you have a two out of three chance that that case is holding at least $400,000. But you still have the $100 in play. [phone rings] [audience murmurs] Hello. <i> [suspenseful music]</i> <i> [Music] [Music]</i> 
- Ooh, she's mad, 
- Okay. Okay. Everything... everything in life has a tipping point. 
- Ooh! 
- Is this the tipping point? The offer now... Is... 
- Courtney! [crowd commotion, shouting] 
- Guarantee! 
- Counter? 
- I would counter with 
- You would add $25,000. 
- I would counter. That's what I would counter with. 
- What you're saying-
- for another $25,000, it is worth the risk of her possibly turning it down and forcing you to open another one. For another $25,000. 
- What if we countered with 5? Is that a no? 
- Counter with 5. 
- Counter with 5? [audience shouting] 
- It's one time! is a guaranteed amount. Courtney Schlaud, deal or no deal? [overlapping shouting] 
- I would like to counter-offer. 
- Okay. 
- For $500,000. [cheers and applause] 
- Can I ask you something? Before she calls back. And that's in. That's in. You can't change that. That's in. That is in. Why did you do that? 
- She wants me gone. 
- Right. But this can also have $100 in it. 
- Correct. My heart is telling me counter at 500. 
- All right. 
- 
- That's all you need! You just handed the game over to her. It's in her control. Let's see what she says. [phone rings] [audience oohs] [ringing] Hello. All right. Okay. 
- Courtney, shake it out. <i> [suspenseful music]</i> 
- Okay. 
- Okay. She said, Courtney asked me to take $1/2 million for what's in that case. And she said, So I look at the board, and I say to myself, while there's a two out of three chance that the case is worth only 400 or 100, there's a better chance it's not worth the million. She said, Why would I do that? Why? <i> [Music] [Music]</i> 
- She wants my million in this case. 
- But there's a two out of three chance that that isn't the million. 
- The beauty of the game. <i> [dramatic, suspenseful music]</i> <i> [Music] [Music]</i> 
- She said, Deal. [dinging] <i> [dynamic music]</i> <i> [Music] [Music]</i> 
- [chanting] Courtney Day, Courtney Day, Courtney Day, Courtney Day, Courtney Day, Courtney Day, Courtney Day. 
- [indistinct] 
- You just sold this case for $1/2 million. 
- I did. 
- That's a lotta money. But we don't know if you made a good deal. 
- Okay. 
- Had you said no deal, what would your next choice have been? 
- Sweet 16. 
- Okay. Open the case. <i> [dramatic chords]</i> 
- Oh, my God! 
- You did the perfect thing. This is 400,000... Your timing was absolutely perfect! How amazing is that? Courtney Schlaud shimmy and shaked her way all the way
