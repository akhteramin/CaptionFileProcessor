Luckily there's me, Cologuard. The noninvasive test you use at home. It all starts when your doctor orders me. Then it's as easy as Get, Go, Gone. You get me when I'm delivered... right to your front door and in the privacy of your own home. There's no prep or special diet needed. You just go to the bathroom, to colle■#r sample. After that, I'm gone, shipped to the lab for DNA testing that finds colon cancer and precancer. <i> Cologuard is not right for</i> <i> everyone.</i> <i> It is not for high risk</i> <i> individuals,</i> <i>including those with a history</i> <i>of colon cancer or precancer.</i> <i> IBD, certain hereditary</i> <i> cancer syndromes,</i> <i> or a family history</i> <i> of colon cancer.</i> Maybe I'll be at your door soon! <i> Ask your doctor if</i> <i> Cologuard is right for you.</i> <i> Covered by Medicare</i> <i> and most major insurers.</i> <i> Back then, we checked our</i> <i> smartphones</i> <i> zero times a day.</i> <i> Times change.
