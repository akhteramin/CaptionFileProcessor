 FAMILY. OBVIOUSLY EMOTION.
 I WANT TO CHOKE THAT'S ON
 ABOUT...
 I THINK BERNIE IS BEING SINCERE
 HERE AND I TELL YOU WHY.
 IF YOU LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO BEEN
 IN PRISON, THERE IS A SENTIMENT
 AND I THINK IT CROSSES CLINICAL
 PARTIES THAT SAYS THOSE PEOPLE
 HAVE TO BE REENTERED INTO
 SOCIETY.
 Greg: I AM ONE OF THOSE
 PEOPLE.
 Juan: OKAY.
 YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HOUSING AND
 JOBS, IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
 WELFARE, YOU SAY THAT GUY
 COMMITTED A FELONY.
 HE CAN'T REENTER SOCIETY.
 WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS
 GOING TO BE A HIGH LEVEL OF
 PEOPLE GOING BACK TO CRIME.
 Greg: YOU ARE A TERRIBLE
 THERAPIST.
 I CAME TO YOU WITH THE PROBLEM
 AND YOU SOLVED -YOU ARE GOING,
 LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS OTHER
 PROBLEM.
 I HAVE NIGHT TERRORS.
 JESSE, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS?
 KEEPT SEPARATE, WHAT'S HIS
  WHAT'S HIS NAME AGAIN?
 BERNIE.
 HE'S TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE IN
 JAIL, TERRORISTS.
 Jesse: DEMOCRATS WANT
 TERRORISTS TO VOTE.
 THINK ABOUT THAT, GREG.
 THEY JUST HANDLED DONALD TRUMP
 THE WEDGE USED OF WEDGE ISSUES.
 JUAN, I HAVE A QUESTION.
 ARE DEMOCRATS TRYING TO LOSE THE
 ELECTION.
 MADE TO ORDER FOR DONALD TRUMP.
 THIS IS WILLIE HORTON 2.0.
 Juan: YOU THINK WILLIE
 HORTON IS GOOD NEWS?
 OKAY.
 Jesse: THIS IS WHAT IT'S
 LIKE.
 THEY HAVE TOTALLY UNDERCUT THEIR
 WHOLE MESSAGING ON ELECTION
 INTEGRITY.
 THEY HAVE BEEN SAYING THE
 RUSSIANS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO
 HACK THE DEMOCRACY.
 THEN THEY WANT TO SET UP VOTING
 BOOTHS ON DEATH ROW.
 I WONDER IF THERE'S EVER GOING
 TO BE ANY CORRUPTION OR FRAUD
 WITH THE VOTING PROCESS IN
 PRISON WHEN YOU HAVE GUARDS WITH
 BATONS LOOKING DOWN ON GUYS
 FILLING OUT THEIR BALLOTS.
 IT'S THE MOST RIDICULOUS THING
 I'VE EVER SEEN AND THE REASON
 THEY ARE DOING THIS, JUAN, IS
 BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PERSUADE
 ENOUGH ACTUAL VOTERS ABOUT THEIR
 IDEAS SO THEY HAVE TO CREATE NEW
 VOTERS.
 THEY GOT ROCKED IN 2016, SO
 INSTEAD OF TRYING TO CHANGE
 THEIR MESSAGE, THEY ARE JUST
 TRYING TO CHANGE THE RULES.
 THIS IS WHAT THEY DID WITH THE
 SUPREME COURT EXPANSION.
 THIS IS THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE
 ALL OVER AGAIN.
 DO YOU THINK PEDOPHILES VOTING
 OR SERIAL RAPISTS VOTING IS
 GOING TO PLAY IN IOWA?
 DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO TAKE
 AWAY YOUR FIRST AMENDMENT
 RIGHTS, SECONDMENT RIGHTS BUT
 THEY WANT TO GIVE VOTING RIGHTS
 TO TERRORISTS.
 Juan: ARE YOU OKAY?
 Jesse: I'M GREAT■.
 Greg: EMILY.
 Juan: DEMOCRATS GOT MORE
 VOTES THAN THE REPUBLICANS IN

 Jesse: NOT IN THE RIGHT
 STATES.
 Greg: ALL OF THEM WERE
 FELONS OR AT LEAST LIVING IN
 CALIFORNIA.
 I AM FROM CALIFORNIA.
 EMILY, YOU CLAIM TO BE A LAWYER.
 Emily: YES.
 Greg: WHAT ARE YOUR
 THOUGHTS?
 Emily: I FEEL SO STRONGLY
 ABOUT THIS.
 LET'S KEEP IT TO THE MOMENT TO
 THE PRESENTLY INCARCERATED.
 YOU MAKE GREAT POINTS.
 6 MILLION PEOPLE A YEAR THAT HER
 POST-CONVICTION FELONS.
 I THINK IT RAISES A LOT OF GREAT
 QUESTIONS.
 WHY DO WE CONDEMN OUR
 INCARCERATED TO CIVIC --
 WHY DO WE TAKE AWAY THEIR RIGHT
 TO VOTE?
 WHY DO WE SUPPORT A PRISON-BASED
 GERRYMANDERING WHEN PEOPLE
 INCARCERATED ARE COUNTED IN THE
 LEGISLATIVE DISTRICT.
 Greg: THAT IS NOT WHAT
 BERNIE IS TALKING ABOUT.
 BERNIE IS TALKING ABOUT LETTING
 A TERRORIST VOTE WHILE HE'S IN
 JAIL.
 Juan: HE IS A CITIZEN STILL
 STILL.
 Greg: HE IS IN PRISON.
 Emily: I WANT TO DRAW THE
 DISTINCTION THAT YOU CAN
 ABSOLUTELY DISTINGUISH VIOLENT
 CRIME, CONVICTS AND WHEN YOU
 REDUCE IT TO THE TINY PERCENTAGE
 OF THE SERIAL RAPIST AND
 BOMBERS, ABSOLUTELY NOT.
 BUT TO RECOGNIZE THOSE
 INCARCERATED, A BIPARTISAN
 COMMITMENT TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE
 REFORM, WHO BETTER TO
 PARTICIPATE POTENTIALLY THAN
 THOSE PRESENTLY INCARCERATED
 IS IT THE 3/5 CONSTITUTIONAL
 CLAUSE ALL OVER AGAIN?
 Greg: THAT WOULD BE A LOUSY
 ARGUMENT, EMILY.
 Dana: I THINK WE ARE
 MISSING ONE OF THE MOST
 IMPORTANT THINGS LAST NIGHT, AND
 THAT IS THAT BERNIE, YES, HE
 SAID THAT.
 THAT WAS HIS INSTINCT.
 DON'T THINK THEY WERE
 ANTICIPATING THE QUESTION.
 MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG HAD A
 DIFFERENT ANSWER.
 Greg: WOULD YOU LIKE TO
 HEAR IT?
 Dana: YES, PLEASE.
 Greg: LET'S PLAY THAT TAPE
 FOR DANA.
 PART OF THE PUNISHMENT WHEN
 YOU'RE CONVICTED OF A CRIME IN
 YOUR INCARCERATED IS, YOU LOSE
 CERTAIN RIGHTS.
 YOU LOSE YOUR FREEDOM.
 I THINK DURING THAT PERIOD, IT
 DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO HAVE AN
 EXCEPTION FOR THE RIGHT TO VOTE.
 AND PEOPLE LEAVE THE PRISON
 SYSTEM, THEY NEED TO BE
 REINTEGRATED INTO THEIR
 COMMUNITIES.
 THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A
 CHANCE TO GET A JOB, TO BE ABLE
 TO FIND DECENT HOUSING, AND THEY
 NEED TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE
 IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS, THAT
 MEANS THEY NEED THE RIGHT■■ TO
 VOTE TO BE REINSTATED.
 Dana: ELIZABETH WARREN, SHE
 IS TRYING TO SOLVE A DIFFERENT
 PROBLEM AND THAT'S THAT AFTER
 YOU'VE SERVED YOUR DEBT TO
 SOCIETY.
 IF WE BELIEVE THAT VOTING IS A
 PRIVILEGE OF YOUR CITIZENSHIP,
 THERE HAS TO BE SOME SORT OF
 PUNISHMENT FOR COMMITTING A
 CRIME.
 IN FLORIDA, THERE WERE A LOT OF
 REPUBLICANS THAT VOTED FOR
 RESTORING VOTING RIGHTS TO
 FELONS.
 THEY MADE A COUPLE EXCEPTIONS
 FOR VIOLENT CRIME AND
 SEXUAL ASSAULT BUT THAT'S
 TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM PEOPLE
 BEING ABLE TO VOTE IN PRISON.
 I THINK MAYOR PETE HAD A MUCH
 BETTER ANSWER THAN BERNIE LAST
 NIGHT.
 Greg: I THINK THAT WIFE
 MAYOR PETE IS RISING, BUT
 BECAUSE HE'S NOT CRAZY.
 Emily: IS IT A PRIVILEGE OR
 AS A RIGHT?
 A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT?
 Juan: IT IS IN THE
 CONSTITUTION.
 IF YOU ARE A
 TERRORIST AND YOU BOMB CIVILIAN
 CIVILIANS.
 Greg: I DON'T MIND TAKING
 THAT RIGHT OR PRIVILEGE TAKEN
 AWAY.
 THEY ARE IN A BOX.
 DO YOU THINK THEY REALLY CARE
 ABOUT VOTING?
 THEY ALREADY CAN'T LEAVE.
 I DON'T SEE -WE ARE ARGUING
 OVER SOMETHING SO STUPID.
 Emily: I SPENT A LOT OF
 TIME WITH INMATES AND THEY DO
 CARE.
 I THINK THAT'S WHY, THOSE
 STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THEY MIGHT
 TURN TOWARDS THE
 DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
 I DO FEEL LIKE A LOT OF THEM
 BASED ON THEIR EXPERIENCE ARE
 WHOLEHEARTEDLY FOR LIMITED
 GOVERNMENT AND LIMITED
 OVERREACH.
 THEY ARE RECEIVING THE BRUNT OF
 IT.
 Greg: NOW YOU CHANGED MY
 MIND.
 Juan: YOU CAME TO ME FOR
 THERAPY AND I'M CRAZY NOW.
 YOU CHANGED MY MIND.
 Greg:   AFTER SEVERAL BOTCHED
 ROLLOUTS, JOE BIDEN SAYS HE'S
 FINALLY READY TO JUMP INTO THE
 2020 RACE.
 THE LATEST NEXT.

 Juan: IT LOOKS LIKE JOE IS
 FINALLY AGO.
 SOURCES SAY JOE BIDEN WILL MAKE
 HIS LONG-AWAITED 2020
 PRESIDENTIAL ANNOUNCEMENT
 THURSDAY.
 HE WILL THEN MAKE HIS FIRST
 APPEARANCE AS AN OFFICIAL
 CANDIDATE NEXT WEEK IN
 PITTSBURGH.
 THE CAMPAIGN ROLLOUT HAS BEEN
 FAR FROM PERFECT.
 IT'S BEEN PLAGUED BY DELAYS, FOR
 EXAMPLE.
 ONE FORMER AIDE REPORTEDLY
 SAYING "I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
 SO -THEY ARE IMPROVISING AND
 DOING LAST-MINUTE PLANNING.
 THE GUY'S BEEN RUNNING FOR
 PRESIDENT SINCE MATE 77 AND
 CAN'T FIGURE OUT THE BASICS LIKE
 WHERE TO STAND ON HIS FIRST DAY.
 THIS SHOULD MAKE EVERYONE VERY
 NERVOUS."
 A NEW NATIONAL POLL HAS BIDEN
 LEADING THE PACK WITH 27%.
 YOU CAN SEE THE NUMBERS.
 SO JESSE, QUICK QUESTION.
 ARE REPUBLICANS SCARED OF
 JOE BIDEN?
 Jesse: I DON'T THINK THEY
 ARE SCARED OF HIM.
 I THINK REPUBLICANS RESPECT
 BIDE WHAT DONE.
 HE HAS APPEAL THAT NEEDS TO BE
 RECOGNIZED.
 AT THE SAME TIME, THE GUY HAS
 GOT TERRIBLE TIMING, POOR
 INSTINCTS, AND HAS COAST ABOUT
 OBAMA'S COATTAILS FOR THE LAST
 I■■ DON'T THINK HE HAS THE GENEO
 MANAGE A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.
 YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT
 SAYS I'M A GOOD MANAGER.
 BIDEN HAS NEVER SHOWN AN ABILITY
 TO MANAGE ANYTHING.
 YOU HAVE TO CREATE A HIERARCHY.
 YOU HAVE TO HAVE DISCIPLINE.
 YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME SORT OF
 ATTENTION TO DETAIL.
 HE IS A■■■■■■■■■ CHARMING GUY, S
 NOT PROFICIENT AND HE DOESN'T
 HAVE THE SKILLS TO MANAGE A
 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.
 THAT'S WHY IT'S SO SLOPPY.
 I WILL POINT OUT ONE THING THAT
 HE IS LAUNCHING IN PITTSBURGH
 WHICH IS INTERESTING.
 PENNSYLVANIA.
 KAMALA AND SANDERS HAVE ALSO
 BEEN IN PENNSYLVANIA AND
 MICHIGAN AND WISCONSIN.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST GOT BACK
 FROM MICHIGAN AND I WAS GOING TO
 WISCONSIN THIS WEEKEND.
 EVERYTHING IS TAKING PLACE ON
 THE DEMOCRATS' TURF AND THAT'S
 NOT A GOOD PLACE FOR THE
 DEMOCRATS TO BE.
 THEY ARE SO UNDER PRESSURE TO
 WIN AND THEIR OWN BLUE STATES
 THAT IT'S GOING TO BE HARD FOR
 THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO BE
 SPREAD TOO THIN FINANCIALLY.
 Juan: DANA, LET'S TALK
 ABOUT THE ROLLOUT.
 HE SAW THE COMMENTS, VERY SORT
 OF DERISIVE, SAYING HE DOESN'T
 KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING.
 LET ME TELL YOU THE SCENE THAT
 THEY ARE LOOKING AT IS THE
 BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA
 AND THEY ARE CONSIDERING NOT
 ONLY WILL THERE BE A VIDEO ON
 THURSDAY MORNING BUT POSSIBLY
 THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE BIDEN ON
 THE STEPS OF THE PHILADELPHIA
 ART MUSEUM, LIKE ROCKY, I'M
 READY TO GO.
 THEN THE QUESTION IT, DOES HE GO
 TO D.C., DELAWARE?
 THEY ROLLED OUT CHARLOTTESVILLE,
 VIRGINIA, WHERE THAT TERRIBLE
 INCIDENT TOOK PLACE.
 WHAT YOU THINK?
 Dana: THE ROLLOUT, IF
 YOU'RE FOLLOWING IT EVERY DAY
 AND YOU'RE WAITING FOR HIM TO
 ANNOUNCE, IT LOOKS VERY SLOPPY
 AND SHAKY.
 IF YOU LOOK AT THE POLL, PEOPLE
 THAT ARE DEMOCRATIC VOTERS LOOK
 AT IT AND SAY THEY LIKE HIM.
 I THINK MAYBE WHEN WE ARE
 COVERING IT EVERY SINGLE DAY, TO
 STEP BACK AND LOOK AT THE BIGGER
 PICTURE FOR HIM.
 THE FORMER AIDE TO GIVE THAT■■Oo
 SOMEBODY WHO WAS ACTUALLY ON
 PRESIDENT OBAMA'S TEAM.
 OFTEN, THERE'S THE TENSION
 BETWEEN THE PRESIDENTS TEAM
 VERSUS THE VICE PRESIDENT'S
 TEAM.
 NOT AN HOURLY ADMINISTRATION, OF
 COURSE.
 THEN YOU CAN LOOKCALLY
 UPON SOMEBODY'S EFFORTS.
 IT■ MAKES ME WONDER IF THERE ARE
 SOME OBAMA PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING
 TO HOLD BACK SUPPORT FOR BIDEN
 AND NOT COME OUT WITH HIM.
 SOME PEOPLE HAVE GONE TO
 MAYOR PETE.
 I DON'T THINK ANY OF THEM WILL
 WORK FOR BERNIE BUT THERE'S
 DEFINITELY NOT A COHESIVE UNIT
 BEHIND HIM FROM THE OBAMA TEAM.
 Juan: LET ME PUT UP SOME
 POLLS THAT WE CAN SHOW TO GREG.
 Greg: I LOVE POLES, JUAN.
 Juan: IN IOWA, IN FACT
 BIDEN IS TIED WITH
 BERNIE SANDERS, ACCORDING TO THE
 DEMOCRATS VOTING.
 HOW ABOUT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE?
 HERE WE HAVE BERNIE SANDERS
 LEADING ALMOST DOUBLE WHAT
 JOE BIDEN HAS.
 THEN YOU GET TO SOUTH CAROLINA,
 BIDEN HAS A BIG LEAD.
 NEVADA AGAIN.
 BIDEN WITH THE LEAD.
 EMILY, DO YOU WANT TO TAKE A
 SHOT?
 WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THOSE POLLS?
 Emily: SOME OF THOSE POLLS
 HAVE INDICATED THAT BIDEN
 SUPPORT HAS BEEN LITERALLY
 HALVED IN THE LAST TEN DAYS.
 AS AN ARGUMENT WHETHER THESE ARE
 ACCURATE.
 WE'VE BEEN FOOLED BY THE POLLS
 BEFORE.
 I THINK THAT CAN BE AN ARGUMENT
 MADE THAT IS IT FUMBLING OR IS
 IT METHODICAL AND STRATEGIC?
 THEY ARE SO -THEY DON'T WANT
 TO MAKE A MISSTEP AND MAKE SURE
 EVERYTHING'S RIGHT.
 MAYBE IT'S AN INDICATION THAT
 THEY'RE BEING REALLY SCRUPULOUS
 AND I THINK I WONDER MOVING
 FORWARD, ALTHOUGH OBAMA HASN'T
 EXPRESSED SUPPORT AT THIS POINT,
 MAYBE IT'S BIDEN THAT WOULD GET
 THE OBAMA AND CLINTON MONEY THAT
 HE WOULD BE THE BENEFIT OF THAT.
 WE KNOW OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY
 IS KIND OF HATING BERNIE RIGHT
 NOW BUT BIDEN MIGHT BE THE
 CANDIDATE, WHAT IF IT'S CONOR
 LAM SITUATION WHERE HE IS
 REPRESENTING THE G.O.P. LEANING
 GERRYMANDERING DISTRICTS THAT
 WERE KIND OF
 ANTI-HILLARY CLINTON.
 HAVE THEY'VE SEEN BENEFITS FROM
 THIS ADMINISTRATION PERSONALLY?
 WOULD HE DETRACT FROM THAT?
 I'M FULL OF QUESTIONS AND NO
 ANSWERS.
 Greg: I WILL TRY TO ANSWER
 ALL OF YOUR QUESTIONS.
 I'M AMAZED HOW QUICKLY BETO IS
 DISAPPEARING SINCE BUTTIGIEG
 CAME IN.
 DISAPPEARING FASTER THAN A
 TWINKIE ON MICHAEL MOORE'S LAP.
 HAVEN'T USE THAT ONE IN A WHILE.
 BIDEN REMINDS ME OF THE SEINFELD
 EPISODE WHERE A PERSON CAN
 APPEAR ATTRACTIVE DEPENDING ON
 THE LIGHTING.
 SOMETIMES YOU LOOK AT BIDEN A
 NEW GO YOU KNOW WHAT, HE'S
 APPEALING.
 HE'S MODERATE, SENSIBLE.
 SEEMS KIND OF HAS AN AIR OF
 CONFIDENCE ABOUT HIM.
 WHEN YOU SEE THEM AGAIN AND YOU
 THINK NO, HE'S CLUMSY.
 HE'S NOT VERY BRIGHT.
 HE COULD BE AN ABSOLUTE
 DISASTER.
 HE'S KIND OF LIKE VEERING FROM
 ONE TO THE OTHER.
 POLITICAL PIG PEN.
 GOT A BIG CLOUD OF DUST
 FOLLOWING HIM.
 A SENSE OF AGE, IRRELEVANCE,
 DECISION.
 I CAN FEEL THE PARTY DOESN'T
 WANT HIM.
 WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT HIM DOING
 THE VIDEO.
 HE DID A VIDEO TO RULE OUT ANY
 MISTAKES.
 WHEN YOU DO A PRETAPE FOR TV, A
 REALLY BAD GUEST.
 Dana: NOT COMING DOWN THE
 ESCALATOR.
 Greg: THEY DIDN'T WANT TO
 TRUST THAT HE MIGHT NOT FALL
 DOWN ESCALATOR.
 BUT WE MADE FUN OF TRUMP FOR
 BEING CHAOTIC, FOR BEING --
 Jesse: WE DID?
 Greg: I'M SURE I DID.
 I THINK I MADE FUN OF GOING DOWN
 THE ESCALATOR.
 I THINK I SAID HIS CAMPAIGN WAS
 OVER WHEN HE WENT DOWN
 ESCALATOR.
 I CAN TELL YOU WHEN I'M WRONG.
 Dana: WE STARTED OUR SHOW
 TODAY WITH THE BERNIE COMMENTS.
 HE IS TEFLON FOR THE DEMOCRATS.
 HIS BASE, THEIR UNSHAKABLE.
 Juan: ONE LAST THING, YOU
 SAID DEMOCRATS REALLY DON'T WANT
 HIM.
 POLLS INDICATE THEY DO.
 Greg: I THINK THE NAME
 RECOGNITION, I DON'T KNOW.
 I STILL PUT MONEY ON KAMALA.
 I'M JUST GOT FEELING.
 Jesse: THE PRONUNCIATION.
 Greg: WHAT ABOUT KRISTEN
 GILLIBRAND?
 Juan: WE ARE GOING TO PUT
 THE U BACK IN YOUR NAME.
 Jesse: OH!
 Juan: HILLARY CLINTON
 HAMMERING PRESIDENT TRUMP OVER
 THE MUELLER REPORT.
 WHAT SHE IS SAYING ABOUT
 IMPEACHMENT NEXT.
 THAT'S HERE FOR YOU ON
 "THE FIVE" ."

  I don't keep track of regrets.
   I never count the wrinkles.
  And I don't add up the years.
    But what I do count on...
  is staying happy and healthy.
        So, I add protein,

 Jesse: STEVEN MOORE 2020
 DEMOCRATS ARE DRIBBLING ON THE
 TRUMP IMPEACHMENT TRAIN.
 IF ANY OTHER HUMAN BEING IN
 THIS COUNTRY HAD DONE WHAT'S
 DOCUMENTED IN THE MUELLER
 REPORT, THEY WOULD BE ARRESTED
 AND PUT IN JAIL.
 I BELIEVE WE NEED TO GET RID
 OF THIS PRESIDENT.
 I BELIEVE CONGRESS SHOULD TAKE
 STEPS TOWARDS IMPEACHMENT.
 I THINK HE'S MADE IT PRETTY
 CLEAR THAT HE DESERVES
 IMPEACHMENT.
 I'M GOING TO LEVERAGE THE HOUSE
 AND SENATE TO FIGURE IT OUT.
 Jesse: HILLARY CLINTON
 GETTING IN ON THE ACTION SHOWING
 SHE IS STILL NOT OVER 2016, SHE
 WAS ACTUALLY CLAIMING THAT
 MUELLER WAS TOO EASY ON FRONT,
 EVEN AFTER THE FBI GAVE HER A
 FREE PASS.
 I THINK THERE'S ENOUGH THERE
 THAN ANY OTHER PERSON WHO HAD
 ENGAGED IN THOSE ACTS WOULD
 CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN INDICTED.
 AS I READ IT, WHAT I THOUGHT IT
 WAS SAYING WAS WE THINK HE
 OBSTRUCTED JUSTICE.
 HERE ARE 11 EXAMPLES OF WHY WE
 THINK HE OBSTRUCTED JUSTICE.
 YOU COULD NOT BE MORE EXPLICIT
 THEN PLEASE, LOOK AT THIS LOOK
 AT IT AND CONCLUDED DOESN'T
 RISE TO IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE.
 THAT'S YOUR JOB.
 BUT I'M GIVING THIS TO YOU.
 Jesse: DANA, TRUMP WAS
 INVESTIGATED FOR CRIME THAT
 NEVER EXISTED.
 I DON'T SEE HOW DEMOCRATS CAN
 TAKE THIS AND RUN WITH IT.
 Dana: IT'S INTERESTING THAT
 BERNIE AND NANCY PELOSI ARE
 LEADING THE ANTI-IMPEACHMENT
 CHARGE.
 Jesse: VERY INTERESTING.
 Dana: THE ALSO HAVE THE OLD
 GUARD VERSUS THE NEW GUARD.
 THE NEW GUARD IS SAYING WE ARE
 NOT BEHOLDEN TO HISTORY AND WHAT
 HAPPENED WITH BILL CLINTON AND
 THE REPUBLICANS FAILED ATTEMPTS
 TO IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT, GET
 RID OF BILL CLINTON.
 WHEN NOT BEHOLDEN TO THAT.
 WE WANT AND PRIMARY VOTERS SAY
 WE WANT IMPEACHMENT TO BE AT
 LEAST ATTEMPTED.
 SMART PEOPLE GO, IT'S NOT GOING
 TO HAPPEN IN THE SENATE.
 BY THE TIME THEY GET TO THAT
 POINT, WELL INTO THE END OF THIS
 YEAR, NEXT YEAR, PRESIDENT TRUMP
 IS OFF TO THE RACES AND PROBABLY
 HITTING ALTHOUGH SPOTS THAT YOU
 JUST TALKED ABOUT IN THE MIDWEST
 AND THAT'S WHY THINK SOMEONE
 LIKE MAYOR PETE, HE SAYS YEAH, I
 THINK WE SHOULD NOT HAVE THIS
 PRESIDENT BUT I'M GOING TO LET
 THE HOUSE AND SENATE DEAL WITH
 IT.
 HE SIDESTEPS IT.
 Jesse: MAYOR PETE IS
 LOOKING GOOD ON "THE FIVE"
 TODAY.
 VERY IMPRESSIVE.
 ISN'T HE DOING A TOWN HALL WITH
 FOX NEWS?
 Greg: HE IS.
 THE BAR IS SO LOW FOR CHARISMA.
 THERE'S NO CHARISMA ON THAT
 STAGE AND I THINK MAYOR PETE IS
 IN THE TOP LEVEL OF CHARISMA.
 HE SEEMS KIND OF AT EASE WITH
 HIMSELF.
 COMPARED TO LIZ WARREN.
 OF FERN IS CHARISMATIC.
 THE DEMOCRATS ARE LIKE DRUNK AT
 A PARTY THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY
 BOOZE.
 SO THEY ARE IN YOUR BATHROOM
 INGESTING HAND DISINFECTANT AND
 MOUTHWASH.
 YOU HAVE THE BOOMING ECONOMY,
 LOW UNEMPLOYMENT, A STRONG
 DEFENSE.
 AND YOU'VE GOT AMERICA THAT'S
 RESPECTED AND FEARED FOR ONCE.
 NOT MUCH LEFT ON THE TABLE FOR
 YOU TO DRINK.
 SO IMPEACHMENT IS THAT HAND
 DISINFECTANT AND THE MOUTH
 MOUTHWASH IN THE BATHROOM.
 Jesse: WHEN YOU INVITE GREG
 TO A PARTY, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE
 ALCOHOL.
 HE WILL GO THROUGH YOUR
 CABINETS.
 DEMOCRATS DIVIDED ON
 IMPEACHMENT.
 IT LOOKS WEAK THAT THEY CAN'T
 DECIDE WHICH WAY TO GO.
 IF YOU HAVE IT LOOKS WEAK AND
 ISAAC IS WASTING TIME AND
 RESOURCES.
 WE DISCUSSED IT BEFORE, THAT MY
 OPINION, THE COLOSSAL EFFORT
 WOULD TAKE AN EVEN NANCY PELOSI
 SAYING THERE'S KIND OF A LOT OF
 STEPS FROM 0 TO RAMP TO 100.
 THERE'S A LOT OF WAYS TO PROBE
 AND INVESTIGATE.
 THAT'S ALL A WASTE OF TIME.
 IT'S A WASTE OF TIME.
 IT NEEDS ARE NOT LEGISLATING.
 HILLARY CLINTON, IT WAS
 DISTURBING TO ME THAT IT LACKED
 SPECIFICITY AND THE
 INTELLECTUALISM THAT SHE COULD
 HAVE SHINES.
 I DON'T SEE MAYOR PETE'S
 RESPONSE SIDESTEPPING IT.
 WHAT'S THE WORD, YOU DELEGATE.
 LET THEM DO THEIR JOB.
 THAT'S WHAT THEY ELECTED HIM
 FOR.
 THEIR OPINION MATTERS.
 Jesse: BECAUSE HE IS A
 MAYOR, HE CAN JUST DELEGATED TO
 THE HOUSE AND SENATE.
 HOUSE AND SENATE, HE TURNED OVER
 EVERYTHING.
 WHAT DID HE OBSTRUCT?
 Juan: YOU SHOULD READ THE
 REPORT.
 Jesse: WHAT DID HE
 OBSTRUCT?
 Juan: HE WAS TRYING TO
 OBSTRUCT THE MUELLER PROBE IN
 THE INVESTIGATION.
 Jesse: YOU WANT TO IMPEACH
 HIM FOR NOT FIRING THE SPECIAL
 COUNSEL?
 SEVEN IN FACT, THE ARGUMENT
 COMING OUT OF THE TRUMP
 WHITE HOUSE IS ATTACKING DONALD
 McGAHN BECAUSE HE'S THE ONE
 WHO TOLD THE STORY TO MUELLER.
 HE'S GOING TO TELL THE STORY IN
 FRONT --
 Jesse: I AM TRYING TO DO
 SOMETHING WHICH HE HAS PERFECTLY
 LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY TO DO.
 Jesse: DO YOU REMEMBER LAST
 NIGHT, GREG WAS WORRIED ABOUT MY
 TREMORS AND NIGHTMARES.
 I THINK YOUR LIVING A NIGHTMARE.
 LET'S GET TO THIS TOPIC.
 YOU ACT SAFE REPUBLICANS VOTE IN
 DEMOCRATIC PRIMARIES.
 GUESS WHAT.
 IT'S JUST DEMOCRATS.
 IT'S LIKE 70% OF DEMOCRATS WHO
 SAY CONTINUE THE INVESTIGATION.
 CONTINUE THE INVESTIGATION.
 MORE THAN HALF WANT TRUMP
 IMPEACHED.
 WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IS THAT THE
 CANDIDATES ARE RESPONDING TO THE
 FACT THAT MOST DEMOCRATS WANT TO
 SEE THEM NOT LAY DOWN BUT PLAY
 THE HARDBALL AND THE CHEATING
 THAT GOES ON AMONG REPUBLICANS.
 Jesse: IN PEACH BEFORE THE
 REPORT CAME OUT?
 Juan: THAT'S NOT TRUE.
 I WILL SAY WHEN YOU LOOK AT
 INDEPENDENTS WHO ARE CRITICAL
 COHORTS, IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT
 THE 2020 ELECTION, WHAT YOU SEE
 THERE IS 44% OPPOSE IMPEACHMENT.
 Jesse: JUAN, I'M TALKING TO
 YOU.
 I THINK ---
 UP NEXT, IF YOU THOUGHT
 DEMOCRATS WERE DONE WITH
 RIDICULOUS GREEN NEW DEAL
 PROPOSALS, THINK AGAIN.
    I can't tell you who I am      or what I witnessed,

 PROPOSAL■■BAN ICONIC
 SKYSCRAPERS TO HELP FIGHT
 CLIMATE CHANGE.
 WE ARE ACTUALLY MAKING THE
 GREEN NEW DEAL, LIVE HERE IN
 NEW YORK CITY BECAUSE WE'RE
 GOING TO BAN THE CLASSIC GLASS
 AND STEEL SKYSCRAPERS WHICH ARE
 INCREDIBLY INEFFICIENT RATE OF
 SOME ALSO BUILD ONE, THEY CAN
 TAKE STEPS TO MAKE IT
 ENERGY-EFFICIENT BUT WE'RE NOT
 GOING TO LIE WHAT WE USED TO SEE
 IN THE PAST.
 Dana: I GET IT, IN TERMS OF
 ENERGY PRODUCTION, BUT HOW ARE
 YOU GONNA BUILD A SKYSCRAPER
 WITHOUT STEEL?
 "THE NEW YORK POST" COVER MADE
 ME LAUGH OUT LOUD.
 THE STONE AGE.
 I STILL SAY LAUGH OUT LOUD.
 GREG, COME ON, HELP ME.
 Greg: YOU COULD'VE SAVED
 TIME, SAYING LOL.
 Dana: IT'S THE SAME.
 Greg: HE IS AN IDIOT.
 WE KNOW THAT.
 HE TAKES AN ENTIRE MOTORCADE
 EVERY DAY FROM THE UPPER
 EASTSIDE TO BROOKLYN TO THE GYM.
 EVERYDAY HE DOES THIS.
 HIS DEFENSE OF THIS PRACTICE IS
 THAT HE HAS ENACTED ENERGY
 POLICIES CITYWIDE THAT ALLOWS
 HIM TO ABUSE HIS OWN BELIEFS.
 I AM FORCING YOU, THE NEW YORK
 CITIZEN, TO SACRIFICE SO I DON'T
 HAVE TO.
 IMAGINE A PERSONAL TRAINER WHO
 WAKES YOU UP EVERY MORNING AND
 DEMANDS THAT YOU DO GRIM ROUTINE
 OF MILITARY STYLE BOOT CAMP
 EXERCISES AND YOU GET UP OUT OF
 BED AND YOU SEE THAT HE IS
 MORBIDLY OBESE EATING THE
 WORLD'S BIGGEST TOBY.
 Dana: WE HAVE THE RESPONSE
 FROM BILL de BLASIO ABOUT HIS
 COMMUTE.
 IT'S PART OF MY LIFE.
 I COME FROM THAT NEIGHBORHOOD IN
 BROOKLYN.
 IT'S MY HOME.
 I GO THERE ON A REGULAR BASIS TO
 STAY CONNECTED WHY COME FROM AND
 NOT BE IN THE BUBBLE THAT I
 THINK IS A HUGE PROBLEM.
 THE FACT IS THOSE CARS AND THAT
 SECURITY DETAIL ARE PART OF THE
 LIFE OF BEING MAYOR OF
 NEW YORK CITY.
 Dana: JESSE, GOT A GET AWAY
 FROM SKYSCRAPERS AND GO TO
 BROOKLYN GET OUT OF THE BUBBLE.
 Jesse: I AM GLAD THAT HE'S
 IN THE GYM.
 HE'S NOT MESSING EVERYTHING UP
 AT WORK.
 THE GUY IS A LIAR.

 BUSINESS HERE ANYMORE.'S WORSE Y
 IS FOR ME.
 IT'S AN EMPTY GESTURE.
 WHEN YOU ARE A MIRROR POLITICIAN
 AND YOU LOSE AND LOSE AND LOSE,
 DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY.
 YOU HAVE TO FIGHT SOMETHING LIKE
 GLOBAL WARMING.
 YOU DECLARE VICTORY AND NO ONE
 KNOWS AND NO ONE CAN KEEP COUNT
 OF WHO'S WINNING AND LOSING.
 GLOBAL WARMING IS NOT SOMETHING
 THAT YOU NEED TO FIGHT.
 IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU CANINST.
 NOT BUILDING A SKYSCRAPER, I AM
 TEMPTED TO USE THE HORSE
 ANALOGY.■;■;
 THE PRODUCER WARNED MST
 IT.

 MAKING PROGRESS, THEY DO THAT BY
 GOING BACKWARDS.
 I THINK THE STONE AGE THING
 PERFECTLY ENCAPSULATED THAT.
 Dana: EMILY, YOU DON'T LIVE
 IN NEW YORK CITY.
 YOU VISIT OFTEN.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK?
 Emily: IT'S RIDICULOUS.
 LIKE ALL OF THESE PLANS, WHEN
 YOU LOOK AT THE SPECIFICS, IT'S
 ABSOLUTELY ABSURD.
 HE WAS LIKE THE HUDSON YARD WAS
 BUILT AND THEN THE DEVELOPER
 CAME OUT AND SAID THAT'S FUNNY
 BECAUSE THE ALL GLASS BUILDING
 IS LITERALLY CERTIFIED LEED
 PLATINUM AND THE BANK OF AMERICA
 BUILDING.
 SOMEONE CALCULATED THAT ITS
 CERTIFIED LEED PLATINUM AND
 WOULD HAVE TO PAYÑÑ5 MILL

 THERE'S NOT ENOUGH CONTRACTORS
 TO HAVE THESE 50,000 BUILDINGS
 THAT THIS EFFECT BE BROUGHT UP
 TO CODE.
 WASTING EVERYONE'S TIME.
 Dana: JUAN, I'M SURE THAT
 YOU AGREE.
 Juan: NOT AT ALL.
 IN FACT, YOU GUYS ARE SO
 APOPLECTIC.
 WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF THE TERMS
 OF A CONVERSATION?
 [ALL SPEAKING]
 YOU ARE LIKE OH, MY GOD.
 Greg: I JUST STATED A FACT.
 Juan: THE REALITY IS HE'S
 TALKING ABOUT TIGHTENING THE
 CODES SO THAT THEY ARE MORE
 EFFICIENT.
 Dana: HOW ABOUT PICKING UP
 THE TRASH?
 Juan: HE IS SAYING THAT IF
 YOU'RE IN A SMALLER BUILDING,
 YOU DON'T HAVE TO PLAY BY THESE
 RULES.
 PUBLIC HOUSING, YOU DON'T HAVE
 TO PLAY BY THESE RULES.
 RENT CONTROL.
 JESSE SAYS THEY'RE NOT BUILDING
 SKYSCRAPERS.
 YOU NEED TO WALK AROUND.
 THEY ARE BUILDING SKYSCRAPERS
 RIGHT HERE.
 YOU CAN SEE ONE FROM THIS
 STUDIO.
 NEW YORK IS BOOMING AND GUESS
 WHAT, PEOPLE WANT SOMETHING DONE
 ON CLIMATE CHANGE.
 REPUBLICANS HAVE NO PLAN.
 YET THEY WANT TO SCREAM AT
 EVERYONE ELSE WHO SAYS LET'S
 HAVE SOME RATIONAL CONVERSATION
 ABOUT HOW WE CAN DO BETTER IN
 TERMS OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY.
 Dana: 115 PEOPLE ARE
 LEAVING THE CITY A DAY.
 Jesse: ASK UNIONS IF THEY
 WANT TO STOP BUILDING
 SKYSCRAPERS.
 Juan: NO ONE SAID STOP
 BUILDING.
 HE SAID TIGHTEN THE CODES.
 Dana: CONTROVERSIAL NEW

 PLACE OUR PARTNERS AND SCARY

 PROTOCOLS AND RESOURCES IN PLACE

 EMPLOYEES SIGNING A PETITION,
 IT'S LIKE AN EMPLOYER RESPONDING

 A WORKPLACE ACCOMMODATION
 ALMOST.
 SECONDLY, THE GOVERNMENT
 INVESTIGATION THAT ENSUED AFTER
 TWO WERE POKED BY SYRINGES IN
 THE SAME MONTH.
 Greg: IT'S ALL ABOUT THE
 FEAR OF BEING SUED.
 A CITY RUN BY THE LEFT, THE CITY
 BECOMES A BATHROOM AND THE
 BATHROOM BECOMES A SHOOTING
 GALLERY.
 BUSINESSES THAT ARE IN A BIND.
 YOU WANT TO TREAT YOUR PROPERTY
 THE WAY YOU WANTED TO BE
 TREATED.
 NO SHIRTS, NO SHOES, NO JUNKIES,
 NO SERVICE.
 THAT'S WHAT■, SAY.
 BUT THEN YOU INCUR THE WRATH OF
 THE WOKE.
 SO YOU GIVE UP AND SAY FORGET
 IT.
 BUT THE BOXES IN THERE.
 YOU FAILED TO UNDERSTAND THE
 INCENTIVES THAT THE
 WORD-OF-MOUTH IS THAT YOU CAN
 SHOOT UP IN THE BATHROOM, YOU'RE
 GOING TO HAVE MORE PEOPLE
 SHOOTING UP.
 THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS.
 Juan: I THINK MOST
 BUSINESSES THAT THEY HAVE
 SEEN EVIDENCE OF DRUG USE IN
 THEIR BATHROOMS, NOT JUST
 STARBUCKS.
 IT'S A REALITY.
 A LOT OF BUSINESSES, IN ADDITION
 TO HAVING EMERGENCY AID KITS,
 HAVE SHARP KIDS.
 STUCK ON THE WALL.ARILY■■■■■
 ST IS SAYING THEY ARE
 GOING TO PUT THEM ON THE WALL IN
 THE BATHROOMS.
 WHAT STRIKES ME IS STARBUCKS
 RECENTLY SAID ANYBODY CAN USE
 THE BATHROOMS.
 IF■■ THAT, YOU KNOW WHAT,
 YOU'RE GOING TO GET PEOPLE WHO
 WANT TO MISBEHAVE.
 SOME BARS YOU GO IN, THEY DON'T
 HAVE A DOOR ON THE BATHROOM
 STALL BECAUSE THEY ARE SO AWARE
 OF PEOPLE DOING DRUGS IN THE
 BATHROOM.
 Greg: I HATE THOSE BARS.
 Dana: I'VE NEVER BEEN TO
 ONE OF THOSE.
 Jesse: OBVIOUSLY NOT, DANA.
 Emily: ONE YOU THINK ABOUT
 THE ARGUMENT THAT
 INCENTIVIZES --
 Dana: THE POINT THAT I
 WROTE DOWN IS, IS THE GOVERNMENT
 FAILING IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR
 HAS TO FIND A WAY TO DEAL WITH
 IT?
 WHEN STARBUCKS MADE THE
 ANNOUNCEMENT, ALLOWING EVERYONE
 TO COME AND USE THE BATHROOM, WE
 ALL SAID IT'S INEVITABLE.
 IS IT A PUBLIC SERVICE?
 RETURNING -ARE WE TURNING OUR
 BUSINESSES INTO WHAT SHOULD BE A
 GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITY?
 IT SOUNDS LIKE IT.
 Jesse: I WOULD NEVER
 SECOND-GUESS A MULTINATIONAL
 CORPORATION.
 I THINK THEY ARE ALWAYS CORRECT
 AND I THINK I'M GOING TO AGREE
 WITH THEM THIS TIME.
 IT'S LIKE HANDING OUT CONDOMS IN
 HIGH SCHOOL.
 PEOPLE HAVE THAT DEBATE, THEY'RE
 GOING TO DO IT ANYWAY, YOU MIGHT
 AS WILL HAVE THEM USE
 PROTECTION.
 I DON'T THINK JUNKIES ARE GOING
 INTO STARBUCKS TO SHOOT UP
 KNOWING THAT THEY CAN DISPOSE OF
 THE NEEDLES.
 I THINK THEY ARE TRYING TO
 PROTECT THEIR EMPLOYEES FROM
 GETTING POKED FROM A DIRTY
 SYRINGE.
 Emily: THE COST-BENEFIT L
 ANALYSIS, THEIR RISK ASSOCIATED
 WITH MAKING BLOOD CONTACT,
 GETTING POKED, ONE OF THE
 EMPLOYEES GET THE DISEASE?
 Juan: YOU COULD GET HIV,
 HEPATITIS.
 Emily: IT'S WORSE
 POTENTIALLY THAN THE MILLIONS
 FOR INSTALLING IT.
 IT'S ONLY IN CERTAIN MARKETS.
 Jesse: PROBABLY IN
 SAN FRANCISCO OR IN THE VILLAGE
 OR SOMETHING.
 IT'S NOT A WIDESPREAD.
 Dana: THIS IS NOT HAPPENING
 IN CHEYENNE.
 Jesse: YOU EVER SEE HOW
 NICE THE PEOPLE ARE THAT WORK AT
 STARBUCKS?
 THEY ARE THE NICEST PEOPLE.
 Greg: WE KNOW WHAT YOU ARE
 DOING.
 YOU'RE TRYING TO GET A FREE

 Jesse: I DON'T NEED A FREE

       Turning 50 opens the  door to a lot of new things...
    like now your doctor may be          talking to you
          about screening         for colon cancer.
        Luckily there's me,            Cologuard.
       The noninvasive test         you use at home.
      It all starts when your         doctor orders me.
         Then it's as easy         as Get, Go, Gone.
       You get me when I'm           delivered...
     right to your front door
    and in the privacy of your            own home.
        There's no prep or       special diet needed.
   You just go to the bathroom,     to colle■#r sample.
      After that, I'm gone,
      shipped to the lab for           DNA testing
      that finds colon cancer          and precancer.
   <i> Cologuard is not right for</i>           <i> everyone.</i>
     <i> It is not for high risk</i>           <i> individuals,</i>
 <i>including those with a history</i> <i>of colon cancer or precancer.</i>
     <i> IBD, certain hereditary</i>        <i> cancer syndromes,</i>
       <i> or a family history</i>        <i> of colon cancer.</i>
         Maybe I'll be at         your door soon!
       <i> Ask your doctor if</i>   <i> Cologuard is right for you.</i>
