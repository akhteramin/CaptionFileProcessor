But, really I'm struggling to keep up this brave face to hide my symptoms of depression. I'm taking my antidepressant, like we discussed. But, I'm still feeling depressed. Is it just me? Doctor: It's not just you. Two out of three people on antidepressants may still experience symptoms. When added to an antidepressant, REXULTI has been proven to help reduce symptoms of depression. Woman: So I can stay on my current antidepressant and help build on the progress I've made. Hey, guys. <i> REXULTI is not for everyone.</i> <i> Call your doctor about</i> <i> unusual changes in behavior,</i> <i> worsening depression,</i> <i> or thoughts of suicide.</i> <i> Antidepressants</i> <i> can increase these</i> <i> in those 24 and younger.</i> <i> Elderly dementia</i> <i> patients taking REXULTI</i> <i> have an increased risk</i> <i> of death or stroke.</i> <i> Call your doctor if</i> <i> you have high fever,</i> <i> stiff muscles, and confusion</i> <i> to address a possible</i> <i> life-threatening condition</i> <i> or if you have uncontrollable</i> <i> muscle movements,</i> <i> as these may be permanent.</i> <i> REXULTI has been shown</i> <i> to increase blood sugar</i> <i> in some people.</i> <i> Other risks are increased</i> <i> cholesterol; weight gain;</i> <i> unusual urges</i> <i> or compulsive behaviors;</i> <i> decreased white blood cells,</i> <i> which can be serious;</i> <i> dizziness on standing;</i> <i> seizures; trouble swallowing;</i> <i> and impaired judgment</i> <i> or motor skills.</i> Now, I'm glad I talked with my doctor about adding REXULTI. <i> Feel better about</i> <i> facing the world.</i> <i> Pay $0 for your first</i> <i> REXULTI prescription.</i> <i> Details at REXULTI.com.</i>
