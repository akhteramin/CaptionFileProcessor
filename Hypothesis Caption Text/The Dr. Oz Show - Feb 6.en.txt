 DR. OZ:  THE NORMAL SIGNS OF PREGNANCY NOT THERE.
 ANY MORNING SICKNESS?
 ABSOLUTELY NOT.
 I DIDN'T GAIN ANY WEIGHT.
 DR. OZ:  BIRTH PLAN, NO TIME FOR
 ONE.
 THE UNBELIEVABLE TRUE STORIES OF
 WOMEN WHO DID NOT KNOW THEY WERE
 PREGNANT.
 WHEN THEY DID THE ULTRASOUND
 ON MY KIDNEY STONES, THAT'S WHEN
 THEY FOUND OLIVER.
 DR. OZ:  PLUS IT'S THE DISH,
 THIS WEEK, HEALTHIER BACON
 DISHES.
 IT SMELLS SO GOOD.
 DR. OZ:  COMING UP NEXT!
 ARE YOU ALL READY FOR SEASON 10?
 YEAH!
 I LOVE YOU DR. OZ!
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ:  TODAY, REAL LIFE
 STORIES OF WOMEN WHO ARE NO
 IDEA, NO IDEA THEY WERE PREGNANT
 UNTIL MOMENTS BEFORE THEY GAVE
 BIRTH.
 ONE MOM SAYS AFTER A MEAL OF
 CHINESE TAKEOUT, WHICH WE ALL
 LOVE, SHE THOUGHT HER
 INDIGESTION WAS BECAUSE OF A
 FOOD BABY, YOU HEARD OF THOSE
 FOOD BABIES, RIGHT, A LITTLE
 POOCH AFTER A BIG MEAL.
 IT TURNED OUT IT WAS A 37-WEEK
 BABY BOY.
 THERE HE IS.
 ANOTHER MOM WAS EXPECTING TO SEE
 KIDNEY STONES ON HER ULTRASOUND,
 NOT A BABY THAT WAS ABOUT TO BE
 DELIVERED.
 CUTE, CUTE, CUTE.
 CAN YOU IMAGINE?
 IT TURNS OUT IT ACTUALLY HAPPENS
 MORE OFTEN THAN YOU THINK.
 I WENT TO THE HOSPITAL FOR
 EXTREME STOMACH PAIN.
 AFTER BEING THERE ALL DAY, I
 WENT IN FOR AN ULTRASOUND, I HAD
 A BIRTH AT 11:06.
 THEY ASKED ME IF THERE WAS A
 CHANCE I WAS PREGNANT?
 WENT TO ULTRASOUND, 36 WEEKS,
 TWO DAYS.
 MY WATER BROKE.
 DR. OZ:  OVER THE YEARS, THE
 UNBELIEVABLE STORIES HAVE POURED
 IN, WOMEN WHO HAD NO IDEA THEY
 WERE PREGNANT UNTIL MOMENTS
 BEFORE THEY DELIVERED AND THEY
 SAW NO WARNING SIGNS FOR NINE
 MONTHS.
 DEBATE YOU HAVE NAUSEA OR
 VOMITING OR INTESTINAL ISSUES AT
 ALL?
 I GOT SICK ONE TIME, I
 THOUGHT I HAD BAD BARBECUE.
 I HAD MY PERIOD EVERY MONTH.
 I THOUGHT I WAS COP AT THIS
 UPDATED.
 ONE BIG PUSH, MY BABY CAME
 OUT.
 DR. OZ:  SOME STORIES DEFIED THE
 ODDS.
 WHY WOULD I BE PREGNANT WHEN
 I WAS MARRIED FOR 22 YEARS, I'M

 DR. OZ:  AND THE LATEST, A
 SURPRISE DELIVERY AFTER A NIGHT
 OF INDIGESTION OF WHAT SHE
 THOUGHT WAS BAD CHINESE FOOD,
 CRYSTAL GOT THE SHOCK OF HER
 LIFE.
 DR. OZ:  LET'S START WITH
 CRYSTAL WHOSE BABY, FOOD BABIES
 TURNED OUT TO BE A REAL BABY.
 YOU SAY YOU HAVE NO IDEA THAT
 YOU WERE PREGNANT.
 YOU HADN'T KNOWN AT THE TIME.
 FOLKS RIGHT NOW WATCHING WOULD
 SAY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO BE NINE
 MONTHS PREGNANT AND NOT HAVE
 SOME SYMPTOMS.
 THAT'S TRUE.
 I DID NOT GAIN ANY WEIGHT, HAD
 NO BACK PAIN OR ANYTHING, IT'S
 CRAZY.
 DR. OZ:  YOU HAVE BEEN PREGNANT
 BEFORE YOU KNOW THE STORY.
 EXACTLY.
 DR. OZ:  I HAVE A PICTURE OF YOU
 HOLDING YOUR OLDER CHILD, ONE
 IT'SINGLY SHE WAS ACTUALLY
 PREGNANT WITH HER SECOND CHILD
 IN THIS PICTURE.
 YOU TELL ME DO YOU SEE THE
 SECOND CHILD IN THERE?
 WERE YOU TRYING TO GET PREGNANT
 AT THE TIME?
 NO, WE WERE NOT.
 ABSOLUTELY NOT.
 I WAS ON BIRTH CONTROL AND WE
 WERE NOT ACTIVELY TRYING AT ALL.
 DR. OZ:  TAKE US BACK TO THAT
 FATEFUL NIGHT WHEN YOU ORDERED
 CHINESE, WHAT DID YOU ORDER?
 GENERAL CHICKEN.
 DR. OZ:  YOU ENJOY IT, WHAT
 HAPPENS?
 I GO TO ASLEEP.
 I WAKE UP IN A COUPLE HOURS.
 THAT DAY, MY WHOLE LIFE WAS
 CHANGED DRAMATICALLY.
 SO I THOUGHT MAYBE I HAD FOOD
 POISONING OR SOMETHING LIKE,
 THAT BUT THAT WAS NOT THE CASE.
 IT DID NOT GET BETTER.
 THE LONGER THAT I WAITED, THE
 WORSE IT GOT.
 SO EVENTUALLY I HAD TO CALL 911
 AND THAT WAS IT.
 DR. OZ:  YOU CALLED 911 BECAUSE
 YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IS
 HAPPENING.
 YOU THINK MAYBE YOUR APPENDIX
 RUPTURED.
 THE AMBULANCE COMES, WHAT DID
 THEY SAY?
 I WAS IN SO MUCH PAIN AT THAT
 TIME I COULD BARELY ANSWER
 QUESTIONS.
 THEY GOT ME FROM THE BED AND PUT
 ME ON THE STRETCHER.
 AS SOON AS I GOT IN THE
 AMBULANCE, I WAS IN ACTIVE LABOR
 LIKE I WAS HAVING THAT CHILD IN
 MY FRONT YARD.
 RUSHED TO THE HOSPITAL ABOUT
 FIVE MINUTES LATER WHILE STILL
 IN THE AMBULANCE, THEY CALLED
 AND SAID CONGRATULATIONS, YOU'RE
 A NEW DADDY AGAIN, ANOTHER BABY.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ:  SO WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST
 THOUGHT WHEN YOU LOOKED DOWN AND
 YOU REALIZED THERE IS A LITTLE
 BABY BOY, A MIRACLE THERE?
 I WAS TOTALLY SCARED.
 WE LOVED HIM THE MOMENT WE SAW
 HIM.
 HE WAS SUPER SMALL, FIVE POUND
 BABY.
 JUST PERFECT.
 DR. OZ:  DOES HE LIKE CHINESE
 FOOD YET, TOO YOUNG?
 I DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT
 CHINESE FOOD.
 DR. OZ:  YOUR BABY BOY IS 10
 MONTHS OLD.
 BABY OLIVER, COME JOIN US!
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ:  OH, MY GOODNESS.
 COME JOIN US.
 SIT DOWN, OF COURSE.
 OH, MY GOODNESS, HOW CUTE.
 WHAT IS IT LIKE LOOKING AT HIM
 NOW?
 IT'S GREAT, IT'S GREAT NOW.
 HE IS SUCH A GOOD BABY.
 DR. OZ:  TALK ABOUT GOOD.
 HAVE YOU HAD CHINESE FOOD?
 NO.

 TRAUMATIZED.
 I DON'T WANT TO DO IT.
 DR. OZ:  I DIDN'T WANT TO PUT
 FOOD IN HERE, I DON'T WANT TO
 ADD INSULT TO INJURY, I HAVE A
 LITTLE BABY, THIS MAY COME IN
 HANDY.
 THANK YOU SO MUCH.
 DR. OZ:  VERY PROUD OF BOTH OF
 YOU.
 CONGRATULATIONS.
 UP NEXT ANOTHER WOMAN WHO HAD NO
 IDEA SHE WAS PREGNANT WHAT SHE
 THOUGHT WAS AN EXTREMELY PAINFUL
 KIDNEY STONE ENDED UP BEING HER
 FIRST CHILD, STICK AROUND.

  I think she's had her eyes on those Tic Tacs for a while now.
  Everyone loves a Tic Tac Dave!
      It's time to open up.
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] DR. OZ:  WE ARE BACK WITH REAL
 LIFE STORIES OF WOMEN WHO DIDN'T
 KNOW THEY WERE PREGNANT UNTIL
 THEY WERE ABOUT TO DELIVER.
 OUR NEXT GUEST WENT IN FOR AN
 ULTRASOUND FOR HER STOMACH PAIN,
 EXPECTING TO SEE KIDNEY STONES,
 SHE GOT JUST THIS AND OH, NO,
 THAT'S WHAT CHILDREN DO TO YOU.
 HE HAD SHE HAD THE SHOCK OF HER
 LIFE WHEN THE KIDNEY STONES
 REVEALED A BABY.
 SHE HAD BEEN IN LABOR 40 HOURS
 AND WAS ABOUT TO BECOME A MOTHER
 FOR THE FIRST TIME.
 ALLEY IS HERE WITH HER SON
 OLIVER.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ:  BEFORE THE SURPRISE
 BIRTH, YOU ACTUALLY HAD MISSED A
 PERIOD AND DONE A HOME PREGNANCY
 TEST.
 YES.
 DR. OZ:  WHICH CAME BACK?
 NEGATIVE, TWICE.
 DR. OZ:  TWO NEGATIVE  TESTS.
 YES.
 DR. OZ:  ANY OTHER CHANGES?
 I DIDN'T GAIN ANY WEIGHT.
 I GAINED A LITTLE BIT OF WEIGHT.
 I THOUGHT I WASN'T EATING
 HEALTHY AND WORKING OUT AS MUCH
 AS I USED TO.
 I NEVER HAD MORNING SICKNESS.
 I NEVER HAD LOWER ENERGY LEVELS.
 THERE WAS JUST NOTHING ABNORMAL,
 I FELT GREAT.
 DR. OZ:  YOU STARTED TO FEEL
 ABDOMINAL PAIN, LITTLE OLIVER IS
 STILL THERE IN THERE.
 YOU ARE THINKING KIDNEY STONES.
 THAT'S WHAT THE DOCTOR AND
 E.R. THOUGHT, TOO.
 WHEN THEY DID THE ULTRASOUND ON
 MY KIDNEY STONES, THAT'S WHEN
 THEY FOUND OLIVER.
 DR. OZ:  A BIG BOMBSHELL.
 WHAT IS GOING THROUGH YOUR MIND
 AT THIS POINT, HOW CRAZY IS
 THIS?
 WHEN THEY TOLD ME THAT I WAS
 GIVING BIRTH, I WAS SHOCKED AND
 I DID NOT KNOW HOW I WAS GOING
 TO DO IT.
 I WAS NOT PREPARED.
 DR. OZ:  I HAVE BEEN THROUGH
 THIS.
 I HAD NOTHING FOR HIM.
 I DIDN'T HAVE A CAR SEAT.
 I JUST WAS NOT PREPARED TO HAVE
 A BABY, BUT LUCKILY MY MOM IS
 ABSOLUTELY AMAZING AND MY WHOLE
 FAMILY HAS BEEN THERE FOR ME.
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ:  I'M GROWING TO BRING IN
 A DOCTOR TO HELP EXPLAIN THE
 PREGNANCY PHENOMENON.
 WE GOT TWO OLIVERS.
 I HAVE AN OLIVER, TOO.
 MUST BE A POPULAR NAME.
 WE JUST HEARD BOTH OF THESE
 STORIES, OH, NO, IS RIGHT!
 NOT KNOWING THEY'RE PREGNANT,
 HOW DOES SOMEBODY, NOT JUST GET
 PREGNANT WHICH I CAN SEE THAT
 HAPPENING WITHOUT YOU REALLY
 BEING AWARE OF IT, BUT GO
 THROUGH AN ENTIRE PREGNANCY
 WITHOUT ANY IDEA?
 BOTH CRYSTAL AND ALLEY ARE
 GREAT EXAMPLING OF NO TWO PEOPLE
 ARE THE SAME, NO TWO PREGNANCIES
 ARE THE SAME.
 SOME HAVE INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF
 SYMPTOMS AND SOME VERY FEW.
 SOMETIMES WHEN THE PREGNANCY IS
 NOT ON YOUR MIND, YOU CAN
 ATTRIBUTE THE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS
 TO PREGNANTS SO OTHER THINGS,
 YOUR BELLY IS GETTING BIGGER,
 YOU'RE GAINING WEIGHT.
 THE BABY IS MOVING, IT'S
 INDIGESTION.
 DR. OZ:  YOU'RE THE EXPERT,
 PREGNANT TEST, THEY'RE SUPPOSED
 TO WORK.
 ONE AT THE BEGINNING, TWO AT THE
 END, AT NO POINT DOES IT SHOW
 SHE WAS PREGNANT.
 OLIVER WAS IN THERE.
 A COUPLE OF THINGS COULD BE
 AN ISSUE.
 ONE, THE HORMONE OF PREGNANCY
 DECLINES AS THE END OF PREGNANCY
 IS ENSUING AND MAYBE THE URINE
 WAS VERY DILUTE THAT IT WASN'T
 DETECTED IN THE URINE.
 HOWEVER, WHENEVER I'M IN
 QUESTION ON A URINE PREGNANCY
 TEST, I WILL FOLLOW THAT UP WITH
 A BLOOD PREGNANCY TEST.
 DR. OZ:  WOMEN AT HOME WATCHING,
 WE DON'T WANT SURPRISE
 DELIVERIES FROM NOW, BUT AT THE
 MOMENT THEY CAN BE PROBLEMATIC.
 THEY DO HAPPEN MUCH MORE
 FREQUENTLY THAN WE APPRECIATE.
 WHAT DO WOMEN DO NOW TO MAKE
 SURE?
 WHEN WE DO HAVE SYMPTOMS, ANY
 SYMPTOMS, IRREGULAR PERIODS,
 BREAST TENDERNESS, INDIGESTION,
 THESE ARE ALL REALLY GOOD
 REASONS TO SEEK MEDICAL ADVICE,
 GET CARE.
 DR. OZ:  KNOW YOUR BODY,
 CONGRATULATIONS.
 THANK YOU.
 DR. OZ:  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ:  HOW IS ARSENIC SHOWING
 UP IN OUR FRUIT JUICES?
 <i>Listen moms, Hot Pockets are</i> UP IN OUR FRUIT JUICES? CO
 <i>exactly what hungry kids</i>
 <i>want in a snack.</i>
 <i>Premium pepperoni.</i>
 <i>Real Cheese.</i>
 <i>And that buttery garlic crust.</i>
 <i>They're literally stuffed</i>
 <i>full of deliciousness.</i>
 <i>Nothing satisfies</i>
 <i>like 100% real cheese</i>
 <i>and 10 grams of protein.</i>
 <i>(Ding!)</i> <i>♪Hot Pockets!♪</i>
  Do you push through migraine?
 <i>and </i>(Daughter)<i>f protein.</i>     Mom, are you OK to play?
 Yeah honey, how about we play...
      princess and pirates?
   Imagine what you can do with   more migraine-free days.
             Arr!
            En garde!
     When you're not fighting     through migraine
    imagine the possibilities.
  Once-monthly Emgality is used  for the prevention
      of migraine in adults.

 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] DR. OZ:  WHAT'S IN AMERICA'S
 APPLE JUICE.
 NEARLY EIGHT YEARS AGO, WE ASKED
 THAT VERY QUESTION.
 WHAT WE FOUND GOT EVERYONE'S
 ATTENTION.
 LEVELS OF ARSENIC IN APPLE
 JUICES AND A NEW REPORT REVEALS
 ELEVATED LEVELS OF METALS IN
 POPULAR FRUIT JUICES, AND MANY
 ARE MARKETED FOR CHILDREN.
 TODAY WE INVESTIGATE, HOW IS
 ARSENIC STILL SHOWING UP IN OUR
 JUICE?
 IT SHOULD BE ONE OF THE MOST
 WHOLESOME DRINKS FOR YOU AND
 YOUR KIDS, APPLE JUICE, BUT WE
 HAVE DISCOVERED THAT APPLE JUICE
 CAN CONTAIN ARSENIC.
 WHEN WE FIRST DECIDED TO
 INVESTIGATE ARSENIC IN APPLE
 JUICE, THE REACTION WAS
 IMMEDIATE AND OVERWHELMING.
 NOT GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME, IN
 MY OWN HOME, NO, THIS IS
 RIDICULOUS.
 HOW COULD I BE STANDING HERE
 IN AMERICA TALKING ABOUT ARSENIC
 IN APPLE JUICE?
 10 OF THOSE SAMPLES CAME BACK
 WITH HIGHER LIMITS OF ARSENIC
 THAN WE ARE ALLOWING IN OUR
 DRINKING WATER IN AMERICA.
 LOOK AT 88 SAMPLES OF APPLE
 AND GRAPE JUICE, WE FOUND 10% OF
 THOSE SAMPLES EXCEEDED THE
 DRINKING LEVELS FOR ARSENIC.
 DR. OZ:  IN RESPONSE TO THE
 INVESTIGATIONS, NEARLY 1 MILLION
 OF YOU WENT TO OUR WEBSITE TO
 FIND OUT MORE AND MAKE YOUR
 VOICES HEARD.
 HOW COULD THEY DO THIS TO OUR
 CHILDREN?
 I PERSONALLY WILL BE
 CONTACTING ALL OF THE COMPANIES
 AND SAYING WHAT ARE YOU DOING
 ABOUT IT AND THEY GOT TO HEAR
 FROM EVERYBODY ON THE PLANET.
 DR. OZ:  THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S
 RIGHT.
 NEARLY TWO YEARS AFTER OUR
 INITIAL INVESTIGATION, THE
 F.D.A. PROPOSED A NEW LIMIT FOR
 ARSENIC IN APPLE JUICE.
 BACK IN 2013, BUT NEVER MADE IT
 FINAL.
 AND TODAY MANY STILL ARE LEFT
 WONDERING WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH
 AMERICA'S JUICE, SHOULD YOU
 STILL BE CONCERNED?
 I'M STILL PUZZLED AS TO WHY THE
 F.D.A. HAS YET MAKE THAT LIMIT
 FINAL.
 WE'LL HEAR HOW THEY RESPONDED IN
 A MOMENT.
 WITH THE LATEST FINDINGS IS THE
 CHIVE SCIENTIFIC OFFICER AT
 CONSUMER REPORTS.
 I LIKE TO THANK THEM FOR
 SUPPORTING OUR WORK IN 2011 AND
 INDEPENDENTLY VALIDATING OUR
 EFFORTS.
 WE CONTINUE TO TEST OTHER FOODS
 FOR ARSENIC.
 WHAT MADE CONSUMER REPORTS
 RETURN TO FRUIT BEVERAGES, WHAT
 MADE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT
 ARSENIC?
 CONSUMER REPORTS INITIALLY
 INVESTIGATED BACK IN 2011 HEAVY
 METALS IN JUICE.
 AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR
 SUPPORT AND ALL OF WORK THAT YOU
 HAVE DONE SINCE THEN.
 NOW WE WANTED TO DO A SPOT CHECK
 ON THE MARKETPLACE TO SEE
 WHETHER THINGS HAVE IMPROVED.
 DR. OZ:  SO IT'S NOT JUST APPLE
 JUICE THIS TIME, IT'S IMPORTANT.
 WHAT KIND OF JUICES DID YOUR
 TEAM TEST?
 SO CONSUMER REPORTS
 INVESTIGATED 45 JUICES AROUND
 THE COUNTRY FROM BOTTLED JUICES
 AS WELL AS JUICE BOXES.
 AND THEN WE LOOKED AT FOUR
 DIFFERENT FLAVORS OF JUICE,
 APPLE JUICE, GRAPE JUICE, PEAR
 JUICE, JUICE BLENDS, THEY ARE
 MIX TOURS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF
 JUICE.
 DR. OZ:  GIVE THE RESULTS HERE.
 I WANT TO FIND OUT HOW MANY
 TYPES OF JUICES HAVE LEVELS THAT
 WERE CONCERNING TO CONSUMER
 REPORTS.
 SO EVERY SINGLE SAMPLE WE
 MEASURED OR INVESTIGATED HAD
 MEASURABLE LEVELS OF HEAVY
 METALS.
 DR. OZ:  EVERYONE?
 EVERYONE AND NEARLY HALF OF
 THOSE JUICES THAT WE
 INVESTIGATED INCLUDING THOSE
 MARKETED TO CHILDREN HAVE LEVELS
 THAT WERE CONCERNING FOR US.
 DR. OZ:  EVERY PRODUCT I SHOULD
 POINT OUT BUT ONE WAS BELOW THE
 F.D.A.'S PROPOSED LIMIT, YOU'RE
 STILL CONCERNED.
 I TRUST CONSUMER REPORTS.
 I WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHY YOUR
 LEVELS WOULD BE DIFFERENT FAN
 THE F.D.A.S?
 THE F.D.A. HAS PENDING
 PROPOSED STANDARDS FOR HEAVY
 METALS AND JUICE AT ROUGHLY 10
 PARTS BETTER BILLION LEVELS FOR
 YEAR.
 NOW, IF YOU LOOK AT OUR STUDY,
 NEARLY HALF OF THOSE JUICES WE
 INVESTIGATED HAD LEVELS AT THREE
 PARTS PER BILLION, MUCH LOWER
 THAN THAT.
 SO WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S FULLY
 REASONABLE AND FULLY FEASIBLE
 FOR THE F.D.A. TO SET VERY
 STRICT, VERY AGGRESSIVE LEVELS
 AT THE THREE PARTS PER BILLION
 LEVEL RATHER THAN WAITING ON
 HIGHER LESS PROTECTIVE LEVELS.
 DR. OZ:  HALF OF THE COMPANIES
 ARE DOING IT ALREADY, WHY NOT
 REWARD THE GOOD GUYS?
 IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT MAKING MORE
 RULES.
 IF SOME COMPANY IS DOING A
 BETTER JOB THAN OTHER COMPANIES,
 HAVE THE GOOD COMPANIES GET SOME
 BUFF FROM DOING A BETTER JOB.
 THE THING IS WE WANT TO
 PROTECT PEOPLE.
 THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE.
 DR. OZ:  WHICH JUICES, YOU
 SHOWED US FOUR, HAD THE HIGHEST
 MEASURABLE LEVEL OF HEAVY
 METALS?
 INTERESTINGLY GRAPE AND THEN
 FRUIT BLENDS AND THEN FIVE JUICE
 BOXES THAT WE INVESTIGATED HAD
 LEVELS THAT WERE CONCERNING.
 DR. OZ:  WHAT ABOUT THOSE
 ORGANIC JUICE?
 THAT WAS REALLY SURPRISING.
 ORGANIC JUICE PERFORMED EXACTLY
 THE SAME REGARDING HEAVY METALS
 AS CONVENTIONAL JUICE, REALLY
 SURPRISING.
 DR. OZ:  SO YOU CAN'T GET AWAY
 FROM THIS REALLY.
 YOU HAVE TO MAKE A RULE SO WE
 ALL KNOW WHAT IT IS.
 STRICT AGGRESSIVE STANDARDS.
 DR. OZ:  LINDA IS JOINING US,
 YOU'RE HEARING THIS FOR THE
 FIRST TIME, THIS IS NEW
 INFORMATION.
 HOW DO YOU REACT TO THESE
 FINDINGS?
 I'M COMPLETELY UNSETTLED.
 ESPECIALLY WITH THE JUICE BOXES,
 I STILL PACK MY DAUGHTER'S LUNCH
 EVERY DAY.
 I THROW IN AN ORGANIC JUICE BOX.
 I'M LIKE I'M APPALLED BECAUSE
 YOU HAD THIS ON THE SHOW AND
 IT'S SCARY.
 DR. OZ:  SO LET ME SHOW YOU
 SOMETHING THAT YOU MAY FIND
 INTERESTING, I'LL SAY, BECAUSE
 IT MIGHT WORRY YOU AS WELL.
 YOU SHOWED US THE AMOUNT OF
 JUICE THAT A CHILD WOULD HAVE TO
 DRINK REGULARLY TO RAISE
 CONCERNS FOR CONSUMER REPORTS.
 WE FOUND SEVEN JUICES THAT
 ENDED UP HAVING RISK LEVELS AT
 JUST FOUR OUNCES OF JUICE PER
 DAY.
 NOW, THIS IS WHAT FOUR OUNCES
 IS.
 MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALLY HAVE A
 GOOD IDEA OF HOW MUCH FOUR
 OUNCES ACTUALLY IS.
 FOUR OUNCES.
 DR. OZ:  LINDA, IF YOU WENT TO A
 RESTAURANT AND ORDERED JUICE FOR
 YOURSELF OR YOUR CHILDREN, WOULD
 THAT BE WHAT YOU EXPECT?
 PROBABLY MORE.
 IT LOOKS LIKE IT DOESN'T TAKE
 MUCH.
 DR. OZ:  IT SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY
 NORMAL -THAT'S A SERVING SIZE.
 THAT'S EIGHT OUNCES.
 WE FOUND NINE JUICES POSE A RISK
 AT A DAILY CONSUMPTION OF JUST
 ONE CUP OR EIGHT OUNCES PER DAY.
 DR. OZ:  WHAT ABOUT FOR ADULTS,
 LINDA OR ME?
 WE FOUND 10 JUICES, FIVE OF
 WHICH HAD CONCERNING LEVELS THAT
 POSED RISK TO HEALTH AT JUST
 FOUR OUNCES A DAY --
 DR. OZ:  FOR ADULTS.
 FOR ADULTS AND THEN ANOTHER
 FIVE THAT POSE A RISK AT EIGHT
 OUNCES PER DAY FOR ADULTS.
 DR. OZ:  IT'S STRANGE, ISN'T IT.
 SO NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT A
 SCENARIO WHERE THE GOVERNMENT
 HAS A RULE THAT IT'S NOT MADE
 FIRM YET TO LIMIT, BUT IF IT IS
 THE LIMIT, THE REASON THEY MAY
 HAVE PICKED IT, IT'S A LEVEL
 THAT WE TOLERATE IN OUR DRINKING
 WATER.
 DRINKING WATER IS FREE.
 YOU'RE PAYING FOR JUICES, SO YOU
 THINK THEY COULD DO A LITTLE
 BETTER THAN DRINKING WATER.
 WE ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT, THIS
 IS IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE, WE'RE
 NOT TALKING ABOUT LARGE AMOUNTS
 OF ARSENIC, THESE ARE VERY SMALL
 AMOUNTS, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
 DROP FROM THESE THINGS.
 THESE SMALL AMOUNTS CONSUMED
 REGULARLY CAN INCREASE THE RISK
 OF DEVELOPMENTAL PROBLEMS, HEART
 DISEASE, BLADDER, LUNG, SKIN
 CANCERS, A LOT OF THINGS.
 IT'S HARD TO TELL HOW MUCH IS
 TOO MUCH.
 WHY NOT PICK A NUMBER THAT WE
 KNOW IS ACHIEVABLE.
 PLEASE.
 DR. OZ:  PLEASE.
 PLEASE.
 DR. OZ:  MAKE OURSELVES MORE
 COMFORTABLE.
 WHAT ABOUT LEAD, WE TALKED ABOUT
 THE PAINT.
 IS THERE LEAD IN OUR JUICES?
 LEAD IS OF A CONCERN
 CERTAINLY BECAUSE OF THE EFFECTS
 THAT IT CAN HAVE ON DEVELOPMENT,
 PARTICULARLY FOR CHILDREN, THEIR
 BRAIN DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS THE
 BEHAVIOR AMONG OTHER THINGS.
 THE THING THAT WAS INTERESTING
 IS THAT HALF OF THE JUICES THAT
 WE FOUND HAD LEVELS OF LEAD THAT
 WERE CONCERNING TO US.
 MOST EXPERTS SAY THERE ARE
 ABSOLUTELY NO TOLERABLE LEVELS
 OF LEAD FOR CONSUMPTION.
 SO THIS IS A CONCERN INDEED.
 DR. OZ:  WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT
 THAT?
 LEAD, ARSENIC, IT'S LIKE WHAT
 DO WE DRINK NOW?
 DR. OZ:  I THINK WE CAN DRINK
 JUICES.
 WE HAVE TO PUSH THE JUICE
 COMPANIES DOING A GOOD JOB TO
 MAKE THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY FOLLOW
 THE SAME GUIDELINES, WE CAN SIT
 HERE COMFORTABLY A SAY DRINK THE
 JUICE.
 WE ARE STRUGGLING.
 WHY ARE THERE HEAVY METAL IN THE
 DRINKS AND WHEN IS THE F.
 GOING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT?
 THAT IS NEXT.
         When you combine       Ancestry's DNA test
  with its historical records...
        ...you could learn      you're from Ireland...
      ...Donegal, Ireland...
       ...and your ancestor         was a fisherman.
         With blue eyes.
          Just like you.
        Begin your journey         at Ancestry.com.
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] DR. OZ:  WE ARE BACK
 INVESTIGATING ARSENIC IN FRUIT
 JUICES.
 HOW ARE HEAVY METALS STILL
 SHOWING UP IN OUR JUICES.
 LET'S START WITH HOW DO THEY GET
 IN THE JUICES IN THE FIRST
 PLACE.
 IT DOESN'T GET ADDED IN, NOBODY
 IS PUTTING IT IN THERE.
 IT STARTS WITH THE FRUIT.
 THEY ARE NATURALLY IN THE AIR,
 WATER AND SOIL, IT'S THERE.
 WE ALSO HAVE CONTAMINATED THE
 ENVIRONMENT WITH HEAVY METALS.
 THEY'RE FOUND IN POLLUTANTS, IN
 PESTICIDES THAT WE USE AND WE
 TRIED TO CHANGE ALL OF THESE
 THINGS, THERE IS STILL STUFF
 AROUND.
 THE PLANTS GROW IN THIS SOIL AND
 SOME OF THE FRUITS ABSORB MORE
 ARSENIC THAN OTHERS, THE APPLE
 ABSORBS SOME, BUT THE GRAPES
 ABSORB EVEN MORE.
 WE BRING IN DR. JAMES DICKERSON
 FROM CONSUMER REPORTS.
 WE HAVE BEEN RAISING CONCERNS
 FOR YEARS.
 WHY DO YOU THINK THE F.D.A. WITH
 WHOM YOU SPEAK FREQUENTLY
 DOESN'T FINALIZE THE LIMIT OF
 ARSENIC IN PARTICULAR IN OUR
 APPLE JUICE?
 THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.
 WE REALLY DON'T KNOW WHY.
 THAT'S WHY WE WENT TO THEM
 DIRECTLY AND SAID, LOOK, WHAT'S
 GOING ON?
 PLEASE, PLEASE OH, PLEASE SET
 STRICT LIMITS, TAKE THE LIMITS
 THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE THAT ARE
 PENDING THAT I MENTIONED, GO
 AHEAD AND FINALIZE THEM BUT WE
 DON'T KNOW WHY THEY HAVEN'T DONE
 ANYTHING YET.
 DR. OZ:  WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE THE
 JUICE COMPANIES TO DO?
 THEY'RE PROBABLY BETTER OFF
 GETTING AHEAD OF THIS ANYWAY.
 THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS
 WE THINK THEY CAN ADDRESS.
 ONE IS BETTER SOURCING.
 BETTER SOURCING CAN GO A LONG
 WAY TO REDUCING THE AMOUNTS OF
 HEAVY METALS THAT YOU FIND IN
 JUICE.
 DR. OZ:  BUY CLEAR FRUITS AND
 VEGETABLES.
 BE VIGILANT IN THAT RESPECT.
 THE SECOND PART IS LOOKING AT
 THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS AND
 LOOKING AT WAYS TO MINIMIZE
 POTENTIAL CONTAMINATION PATHWAYS
 THERE.
 IT'S SOMETHING THAT IF YOU LOOK
 AT OUR JUICES THAT WE
 INVESTIGATED, HALF OF THEM DO
 NOT HAVE CONCERNING LEVELS, SO
 CLEARLY INDUSTRY IS DOING
 SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND CAN
 ACHIEVE IT.
 IT CAN BE DONE.
 DR. OZ:  LET ME ASK DR. GAIL
 CHARLIE TO JOIN US FROM THE
 JUICE PRODUCT ASSOCIATION.
 THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.
 WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF CONSUMER
 REPORTS FINDINGS?
 CONSUMERS SHOULD BE REASSURED
 BY THESE FINDINGS, FRANKLY, THEY
 SHOW THAT THE JUICE PRODUCERS
 ARE COMPLYING WITH THE SAFETY
 STANDARDS THAT THE FOOD AND DRUG
 ADMINISTRATION HAS SET TO
 PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH.
 SO A JUICE IS SAFE AND I HAVE
 HEARD NOTHING FROM CONSUMER
 REPORTS THAT SHOWS OTHERWISE.
 DR. OZ:  IF HALF THE JUICE
 COMPANIES ARE ALREADY BELOW THE
 LOWER LIMITS THAT CONSUMER
 REPORTS THINKS ARE IDEAL, WHY
 JUST NOT EXPAND THAT TO
 EVERYBODY?
 WELL, THE SAFETY STANDARDS
 SET BY THE SCIENTISTS AT THE
 FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION ARE
 CONSISTENT WITH THE LEGAL
 STANDARD WHICH IS REASONABLE
 CERTAINTY OF NO HARM WHICH IS
 PRODUCERS COMPLYING WITH THOSE
 STANDARDS.
 SETTING THE STANDARDS LOWER THAN
 WHAT'S ALREADY, WHAT THE
 STANDARDS ARE FOR WATER ALREADY
 DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE
 SCIENTIFICALLY BECAUSE WE DRINK
 SO MUCH MORE WATER THAN WE DO
 JUICE.
 DR. OZ:  AND, GAIL, YOU HAVE
 INTERACTED WITH THE F.D.A., DO
 YOU THINK THEY SHOULD FINALIST
 THE LIMITS OF ARSENIC IN JUICE,
 JUST FINISH IT OFF AND SAY THIS
 IS WHAT THE RULE IS?
 SURE, BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW
 THAT FINALIZED OR OTHERWISE THE
 JUICE PRODUCERS ARE ALREADY
 COMPLAINING WITH THAT LIMIT.
 DR. OZ:  GAIL, THANK YOU VERY
 MUCH FOR BEING WITH US.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ:  SO THE BIG QUESTION IS,
 WHY HASN'T THE F.D.A. PASSED
 FORMAL LIMITS IN EIGHT YEARS,
 THE COMPANIES KNOW THE RULES,
 THEY CAN PLAY BY THEM, THEY'RE
 ALREADY DOING THE RIGHT THING.
 WE ASKED THE F.D.A. WHY THEY
 HAVE YET TO FINALIZE THE LIMIT.
 THEY SAY THE FINDINGS UNDERSCORE
 THE PROGRESS THAT HAS BEEN MADE
 IN REDUCING THE AMOUNTS OF THESE
 ELEMENTS IN FRUIT JUICES OVER
 THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS.
 WE ARE ENCOURAGED BY THIS
 PROGRESS AND BELIEVE THE F.D.A.
 OVERSIGHT INDUSTRY
 RESPONSIVENESS WILL CONTINUE TO
 DRIVE INNOVATION AND LEAD TO
 REDUCTIONS IN EXPOSURE.
 GUYS, I KNOW YOU LIKE THE JUICE,
 I DO, TOO, JUICE IS STILL SAFE.
 WE ALL NEED TO BE SMARTER WHEN
 WE DRINK IT.
 NO JUICE FOR INFANTS AND LIMIT
 IT FOR KIDS BECAUSE OF THE SUGAR
 CONTENT.
 I SUGGEST DILUTING JUICE WITH
 WATER.
 I HOPE THAT IS HELPFUL.
 WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ:  THIS CREW IS HERE AND
 TALKING BACON.
 THE CLASSIC TO HEALTHIER
         I'M ALEX TREBEK         HERE TO TELL YOU
 ABOUT THE COLONIAL PENN PROGRAM.
       IF YOU'RE AGE 50-85
      AND LOOKING      TO BUY LIFE INSURANCE

 DR. OZ:  IF THERE IS ONE THING THAT BRINGS US TOGETHER IT'S
 FOOD, WE'RE DISHING ON
 EVERYTHING FROM THE LATEST FOOD
 HACKS AND TRENDS TO EVERYDAY
 RECIPES YOU CAN MAKE FOR DINNER
 TONIGHT.
 SINGING IS MY FIRST LOVE, MY
 OTHER PASSION IS BAKING.
 I'M AN IRON CHEF BUT MOSTLY
 THE EXECUTIVE CHEF OF A
 RESTAURANT AND MOTHER TO AN
 11-YEAR-OLD.
 THIS IS THE FIRST RECIPE I MADE
 IN A PROFESSIONAL KITCHEN, IT IS
 TERRIBLE.
 MY COOKING IS LIKE ME.
 THIS IS LIKE MY GIRLFRIEND IN
 THE KITCHEN.
 I AM AS A CHEF FIRST AND
 FOREMOST ABOUT FLAVOR.
 IT'S SIMPLE, IT'S CELEBRATORY
 AND MOST OF ALL IT'S ABOUT
 HAVING A GREAT TIME IN THE
 KITCHEN.
 I'M TRYING TO HELP.
 LET'S DISH!
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ:  WELCOME TO THE DISH ON
 OZ!
 THE  BACON CRAZE HAS TAKEN OVER
 AMERICA AND IT'S TAKING OVER THE
 DISH.
 FOR YOU, IT'S THE HEART
 HEALTHY SPECIAL.
 I NEVER ORDERED THAT, ALEX,
 PLEASE.
 KATHY WHAT IS ON THE MENU TODAY?
 WE'RE BRINGING YOU HEALTHIER
 TWISTED ON BACON!
 FROM TURKEY BACON TO NITRATEFREE
 OPTIONS, WE'RE INVESTIGATING
 WHAT REALLY MAKES A HEALTHIER
 VERSION OF BACON, IF THERE IS
 SUCH A THING.
 WE INTRODUCE YOU TO THE WEDGE
 SALAD BACON SKEWER, THIS IS YOUR
 NEWEST OBSESSION, AND WE'RE
 SHOWING YOU HOW TO TURN YOUR
 VEGGIES INTO BACON, THAT'S
 RIGHT, WE'RE TASTE TESTING THE
 TRENDING D.Y.I. BACON RECIPES
 TAKING OVER THE INTERNET.
 BEFORE WE GET STARTED ON THIS
 SANDWICH AND ALL OF THAT, ALEX
 HAS DRINKS FOR US.
 A NICE SODA.
 DR. OZ:  OH, MY GOODNESS.
 JUST FOR YOU, THE DR. OZ
 SPECIAL, A BACON SODA.
 WHAT?
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ:  IT ACTUALLY SAYS BACON
 SODA.
 THAT'S FOR YOU.
 DR. OZ:  I'LL SAVE MINE FOR
 LATER.
 TAKE A PASS.
 ALL RIGHT, WHAT DO WE THINK?
 WHY?
 THIS IS A NO.
 A FIRM NO FROM ME.
 THIS SHOULD BE OUTLAWED.
 NEVER DO THAT.
 I ACTUALLY WANT TO BE THE
 BRIGHT BULB ON THIS CHRISTMAS
 TREE RIGHT NOW AND SAY THAT THIS
 SODA HAS A SILVER LINING.
 IT KIND OF IS LIKE A CREAM SODA,
 KIND OF, KIND OF.
 [APPLAUSE]
 LIKE THE AFTERTASTE.
 NOT BUYING THIS?
 NOT A BUYER.
 THAT'S OK, BECAUSE LUCKY FOR
 US, WE'RE IN THE BACON BOOM
 WHERE EVERYTHING IS BACON, IT
 FEELS, YES, THIS SODA, THERE ARE
 HEALTHIER BACONS POPPING UP.
 THE BIG QUESTION IS COULD THEY
 BE AS GOOD AS THE REAL THING.
 WE WANT TO PUT THIS TO THE TEST.
 I KNOW ALEX, YOU HAVE SOME
 STRONG OPINIONS ABOUT WHERE
 BACON BELONGS.
 I JUST DON'T WANT TO BE HERE
 AND NOT HAVE YOU GUYS KNOW HOW I
 FEEL.
 I KNOW.
 I LIKE TO BE REALLY CLEAR ON
 SAYING IT.
 FOOD IS LOVE AND BACON IS
 JUST AT THE HEART OF THE
 CONVERSATION.
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ:  GOT THAT IN THERE.
 THIS VALENTINE'S DAY, SAY IT
 WITH BACON.
 EXACTLY.
 YOU'RE GOING TO TRY TO SELL
 US SOME OTHER THINGS.
 I'M A SERIOUS PURIST WHEN IT
 COMES TO BACON.
 I ACTUALLY, AS YOU SEE, I'M A
 LITTLE BIT WITH YOU.
 I FEEL THE CLASSIC BACON, IT IS
 SALTY, FATTY, CRISPY, VERSATILE,
 DELICIOUS JUST LIKE THIS.
 WE DON'T WANT YOU GUYS TO HAVE
 ANY FOOD, WE'RE GOING TO GO HOG
 WILD!
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 I DO LOVE THE REAL THING.
 PASS THE BACON.
 MY QUESTION FOR YOU, ARE
 THESE HEALTHIER OPTIONS, A LOT
 OF PEOPLE WILL GO ON THE MENU
 AND ORDER THE TURKEY BACON,
 THINKING THEY'RE DOING GOOD FOR
 THEMSELVES.
 IS IT WORTH PASSING THAT BAD BOY
 UP?
 ALEX --
 LIKE AROMA THERAPY.
 DR. OZ:  DO THE HOMEWORK, WE'LL
 DO A HEAD-TO-HEAD COMPARISON.
 YOU CAN CURE IT WITH SEWEDUM
 NITRATE OR SODIUM POUR AND ADD
 SUGAR TO IT.
 TURKEY BACON IS DARK AND WHITE
 MEAT, A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH, YOU
 SPICE IT UP.
 IT TASTED LIKE BACON AND THEN
 YOU PRESS IT INTO A FORM SO IT
 LOOKS LIKE THIS.
 ADD A LITTLE SMOKE TO IT BECAUSE
 IT WON'T ACTUALLY TASTE QUITE
 THE SAME, PORK BELLY.
 WITH CHIPS ORALLY QUID SMOKE IS
 WHAT THEY USE IN THE TURKEY
 BACON, A LITTLE BIT MORE
 SYNTHETIC.
 THEY ADD SALT TO MAKE IT TASTE
 RIGHT.
 SO IT'S MORE PROCESSED.
 WE DON'T LIKE PROCESSED FOODS,
 SO BACON IS THE ANSWER.
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ:  WHAT I'M SERVING WHICH
 ROUGHLY FOR THE SIZE AND SLICES
 OF WHAT YOU GUYS NORMALLY EAT IS
 ABOUT ONE STRIP OF BACON.
 THIS IS NOT ONE OUNCE.
 THIS IS LIKE ONE GRAM.
 DR. OZ:  THIS IS AN OUNCE, IT'S
 A LITTLE BIT LARGER.
 THESE COMPARED HEAD-TO-HEAD, 25
 LESS CALORIES PER TURKEY BACON
 STRIP.
 MY VOTE IS IF YOU THINK THEY
 BOTH TASTE FINE TO YOU, HAVE THE
 TURKEY BACON.
 IF YOU PREFER THE ORIGINAL PORK
 BACON, WHICH IS WHAT I WOULD DO
 AND IN MY FAMILY, WE'RE PORK
 PEOPLE.
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 TO CLARIFY, THERE ARE FEWER
 CALORIES IN THE TURKEY BACON,
 BUT IT'S ALSO MORE PROCESSED.
 DR. OZ:  MORE SALT.
 IN THEORY, JUST TO MAKE YOU
 HAPPIER.
 MY DAD SAYS WE ARE PORK
 PEOPLE.
 I THINK MY DAD, ME AND MY
 BROTHER WOULD ALL CHOOSE THE
 REGULAR BACON.
 MY MOTHER AND MY SISTERS ARE
 VEGETARIANS, SO WE HAVE LIKE ALL
 KINDS OF FUN LITTLE -THERE ARE
 OTHER NONMETAL STERNATIVES ALSO.
 THE SHOW IS KIND OF FULL OF
 THOSE NONMETAL STERNATIVES AND
 THE REAL THING.
 THE INTERNET IS BLOWING UP WITH
 THE NEW SOLUTIONS OF HOW DO WE
 GET A HEALTHIER BACON PROBLEM.
 PEOPLE ARE FOCUSED ON THIS
 BECAUSE BACON IS I THINK
 AMERICA'S MOST BELOVED FOOD.
 FAKON ARE MADE OUT OF VEGGIES,
 WE HAVE VERSIONS FOR YOU TRY.
 WE HAVE AN EGGPLANT VERSION
 THERE, A MUSHROOM BACON.
 DR. OZ:  YOU DON'T GET ANY.
 SEE HOW CRISPY THIS IS,
 THAT'S REALLY GOOD.
 THIS IS EGGPLANT.
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 THIS IS GOOD.
 IT'S PRETTY GOOD.
 I FEEL LIKE I'M CHEATING ON PORK
 BACON BY EATING THIS.
 DATE AROUND, YOU KNOW WHAT I
 MEAN.
 [APPLAUSE]
 SHE'S GOT OPTIONS.
 I LIKE IT.
 I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE
 SKEPTICAL ABOUT THIS.
 I FEEL WE'RE GIVING THIS A TASTE
 TEST AND WE'RE COMING OUT ON
 THIS SIDE.
 DR. OZ:  I LIKE THIS.
 THESE DON'T LOOK LIKE BACON, BUT
 I LOVE MUSHROOMS.
 I COULD GO WITH THIS AND CALL
 IT FAKON.
 YOU WANT TO SEE HOW WE MADE
 THIS TRUE BACON?
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 GIVE ME A PLATE OF THIS.





 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 I LIKE IT.
 I NEED A PLATE OF THIS, I
 THINK.
 AND YOU HAVE ONE MORE TO SHOW
 US.
 I HAVE ONE MORE FAKON HERE.
 YOU'LL NEVER GUESS THE
 INGREDIENTS THAT IT'S MADE OUT
 OF.
 YOU SAY YOU NEVER GUESS, I
 IMMEDIATELY WANT TO KNOW.
 LET'S ANALYZE.

 POTATO --
 WAIT, IT'S COMING TO ME, HOLD
 ON, IT'S GOOD.
 POTATO?
 ANY GUESSES?
 WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
 CHICKEN SKIN?
 ANY MORE GUESSES.
 IT FEELS LIKE SKIN.
 IT'S SEASONED REALLY WELL.
 BANANAS?
 ARE YOU READY FOR THE REVEAL?
 A PLANTAIN OR SOMETHING?
 ARE YOU READY?
 OK, THIS IS WHAT THIS IS.
 WHAT IS THAT?
 EXCUSE ME.
 IT'S RICE PAPER.
 RICE PAPER BACON.
 ARE YOU KIDDING?
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 IF YOU PUT ME HERE FOR THREE
 DAYS IN A ROOM WITH THIS, I
 WOULD HAVE NEVER GUESSED.
 DR. OZ:  THEY CUT IT LIKE THIS?
 WITH A SCISSOR, I GUESS.
 DR. OZ:  THE BACON, THE SPICES,
 THIS IS SHOCKINGLY GOOD.
 REALLY GOOD.
 THIS I REALLY LIKE.
 NICE SPICES.
 YOU TOLD ME IT WAS CHICKEN
 SKIN, I BELIEVE YOU.
 THIS IS HOW GOOD RICE PAPER
 BACON IS.
 DR. OZ:  WHEN WE COME BACK, A
 LOADED BACON WEDGE SALAD
 WILL HAVE YOU
 OBSESSED AND I'LL PROVE IT.
 STICK AROUND!

    Oats have a soluble fiber       called beta-glucan,
 which can help lower cholesterol
          when part of a       heart-healthy diet.
     What's more, these oats   have no artificial flavors,
  preservatives or added colors.
       Now that's something          to celebrate.
 t' dingmiThs
  heur,sok e.d ot'vav oks  .. sk              Woman:   I've been saying, "I'm fine."
            But, really
      I'm struggling to keep      up this brave face
        to hide my symptoms        of depression.
    I'm taking my antidepressant,         like we discussed.
               But, I'm still               feeling depressed.
          Is it just me?
    Doctor: It's not just you.
      Two out of three people      on antidepressants
       may still experience symptoms.
 When added to an  antidepressant,
 REXULTI has been proven
     to help reduce symptoms of depression.
      Woman:      So I can stay on my      current antidepressant
         and help build on      the progress I've made.
                       Hey, guys.

   <i> REXULTI is not for everyone.</i>
      <i> Call your doctor about</i>   <i> unusual changes in behavior,</i>
      <i> worsening depression,</i>      <i> or thoughts of suicide.</i>
        <i> Antidepressants</i>        <i> can increase these</i>
     <i> in those 24 and younger.</i>
         <i> Elderly dementia</i>     <i> patients taking REXULTI</i>
      <i> have an increased risk</i>      <i> of death or stroke.</i>
       <i> Call your doctor if</i>       <i> you have high fever,</i>
   <i> stiff muscles, and confusion</i>
    <i> to address a possible</i>    <i> life-threatening condition</i>
  <i> or if you have uncontrollable</i>        <i> muscle movements,</i>
    <i> as these may be permanent.</i>
      <i> REXULTI has been shown</i>     <i> to increase blood sugar</i>
         <i> in some people.</i>
    <i> Other risks are increased</i>    <i> cholesterol; weight gain;</i>
          <i> unusual urges</i>     <i> or compulsive behaviors;</i>
   <i> decreased white blood cells,</i>      <i> which can be serious;</i>
      <i> dizziness on standing;</i>  <i> seizures; trouble swallowing;</i>
       <i> and impaired judgment</i>       <i> or motor skills.</i>
      Now, I'm glad I talked          with my doctor
       about adding REXULTI.
        <i> Feel better about</i>        <i> facing the world.</i>
      <i> Pay $0 for your first</i>      <i> REXULTI prescription.</i>

     I was on the fence about     changing
   from a manual to an electric   toothbrush.
   But my hygienist said going   electric
 could lead to way cleaner teeth.
  She said, get the one inspired  by dentists,
     with a round brush head.
