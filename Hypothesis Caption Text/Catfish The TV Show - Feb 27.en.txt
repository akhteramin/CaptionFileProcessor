- Oh. <i> [dramatic musical sting]</i> <i> [upbeat music]</i> 
- Hello. 
- Zeke! 
- What's up, man? 
- Hi. Nice to meet you. <i> 
- Zeke Thomas,</i> <i> son of Hall of Fame</i> <i> basketball player</i> <i> Isaiah Thomas,</i> <i> has paved his own path</i> <i> as a renowned DJ and producer.</i> <i> When he's not spinning</i> <i> at the club,</i> <i> he's traveling the country</i> <i> speaking out against</i> <i> sexual assault.</i> <i> A modern-day Renaissance man,</i> <i> we are so thrilled</i> <i> to have Zeke.</i> 
- Nice to meet you. 
- Welcome to the show. 
- Thank you. 
- So, Little bit more about yourself. When did you get started into music? 
- So, my dad being a basketball player, we actually had a basketball court in our house. 
- Indoor. 
- And...indoor. Whenever he was practicing and I would be with him, I was always more concerned with what we were listening to. So we'd be, like, shooting hoops, and all of the sudden I'd be like, Okay, we gotta change the song. So from then on it was just like music was my dream. Worked my way up from there. 
- Nice. And when you travel and you speak about sexual assault-
- because that was an experience that you went through. 
- Yeah, so, unfortunately, I met a person on an app and we went on a date. I was actually drugged and then assaulted. 
- That's terrible. ■■■■■■It was an unfortunatesitu■ I was actually drugged and then assaulted. 
- That's terriblBut it just went ■■■■ to prove to me that not everybody is who they present themselves to be. 
- Right. 
- I didn't really do my homework. And I want people to do their homework. 
- Right. 
- And I think, you know, that's 
- Awesome. Why don't we, uh,ited to come ontow.q■ dig in? 
- I'm nervous, but I'm ready. 
- You're gonna be great. Whoa. We got an email here from Truth. Hey Nev and Zeke, I'm Truth. I'm 23 years young... 
- That's making us feel old. 
- Yeah, I know, right? 
- [laughing] <i> 
- [Music] I'm 23 [Music]</i> 
- I'm a fashion design student in Los Angeles, and I'm in dire need of your help. <i> 
- [Music] This ain't about you [Music]</i> <i> [Music] This is about me [Music]</i> 
- Six months ago, I met Ray'Quan in an Instagram group chat. Ray'Quan is 22, and I think He lives in Trenton, New Jersey. <i> 
- [Music] Is it all in my head,</i> <i> what they said? [Music]</i> 
- When I joined the group, I noticed Ray'Quan Was subtly flirting with me. <i> 
- [Music] I'm feeling</i> <i> misunderstood [Music]</i> 
- So I reached out to him privately. After messaging for a bit, we exchanged numbers and began to converse on the phone through both text messaging and talking. He's a great listener, and when I tell him my problems, he gives me great advice. Compared to all the fake people I've met in LA... 
- There are no fake people in the tri-state area. 
- Yeah, exactly. 
- Ray'Quan was something new and refreshing. <i> 
- [Music] I fall in and out</i> <i> of love [Music]</i> 
- But--there's the but. 
- All right. 
- As great as Ray'Quan sounds... <i> 
- [Music] I really don't know</i> <i> what I'm doing [Music]</i> 
- We've never successfully FaceTimed. 
- That's a red flag. 
- And two months ago, I told him I had purchased a ticket to come and see him. But when the time came for me to visit, He changed his mind. <i> 
- [Music] I'm feeling</i> <i> misunderstood [Music]</i> 
- And I realized he might be hiding something. I haven't questioned him as much as I should, because when I do ask questions, he'll block or ignore me. 
- Block? 
- That may not be ideal for other people and their relationships, but I like a little crazy. 
- So you're crazy. Okay. We got a crazy one. 
- Oh, yeah. I can deal with his temper... ;;>C■ I'm■ 77■■7/ You're my last resort, I can deal with his temper... and I hope to hear from you soon. Truth. This episode's gonna be tricky. Because the person we're trying to help, their naTruth. So every time we're talking about them, and whether or not they're getting lied to, it's gonna be confus an
- It's going to be confusing. they're gett
- Right. to, Is Truth getting the truth? 
- Is Truth getting the truth? Is Truth the liar? 
- Can we trust Truth? 
- I don't know. 
- I don't know. 
- [laughing] 
- Why don't we just get a little bit more from Truth here. [FaceTime ringing] Hey. 
- Truth. <i> 
- Hey.</i> 
- What's up? 
- I love your hair. <i> 
- Thank you, thank you,</i> <i> thank you.</i> <i> I just dyed it.</i> 
- Wow, is that-
- 
- I just did mine too. 
- Sorry, I should introduce you. So, Truth, this is Zeke. 
- Pleasure to meet you as well. 
- He's helping me out on this episode. We just read your email. So you're in Los Angeles? <i> 
- Yes.</i> 
- And you're at a school for design, you said? <i> 
- Yeah, fashion design.</i> 
- Nice. 
- So I have a question for you off the bat. You were in a group chat with this individual. <i> 
- Right.</i> 
- Ray'Quan. Who else was in this group chat? <i> 
- A mutual friend</i> <i> between ours, Kevon,</i> <i> and then some other people.</i> 
- Kevon, is that a real-
- a friend that you know in person, or just like a friend from... <i> 
- From Instagram.</i> <i> I never met him.</i> 
- Right. <i> In the group chat,</i> <i> he's been mean.</i> <i> I don't like him.</i> <i> Kevon, he got an attitude.</i> <i> Like, he's this very--</i> <i> a dark cloud, negative.</i> 
- So you didn't know anybody in this group chat personally. <i> 
- No.</i> 
- Tell us what you do know about Ray'Quan. <i> 
- The first month</i> <i> we was just, like,</i> <i> getting to know each other.</i> <i> And then I was like,</i> <i> Okay, I kinda like him.</i> <i> 'Cause he's, like,</i> <i> a great listener.</i> <i> Usually when we're talking</i> <i> I, like, vent a lot</i> <i> about what I'm going through</i> <i> and, like, what's going on</i> <i> in my life.</i> <i> And he gives great advice</i> <i> and, like, good feedback.</i> 
- But he always says no to FaceTime? <i> 
- Yeah, he has, like,</i> <i> a lot of excuses</i> <i> about why his phone's</i> <i> not working.</i> <i> I don't wanna keep bugging</i> <i> him about FaceTime</i> <i> because he, like, gets mad</i> <i> sometimes and he blocks me.</i> <i> So I was like, okay,</i> <i> better not make him mad.</i> <i> Because I don't want to get</i> <i> blocked for a week again.</i> 
- You got blocked for a week? And then you still talking to him? <i> 
- Yeah. I like crazy people.</i> <i> I'm attracted to crazy.</i> 
- How do you know for sure he's in New Jersey? <i> 
- Now you're making me think.</i> <i> I don't know.</i> <i> I hope he's there.</i> <i> That's what he told me.</i> 
- Oh, now you got his mind working. Truth gotta find the truth. 
- All right, well, look. You're in Los Angeles. We're in Los Angeles too. Why don't we plan on meeting up tomorrow morning to see if we can figure this out? <i> 
- We gotta do something,</i> <i> 'cause I'm over it.</i> 
- Maybe you could have an outfit or something ready for Zeke here. You could try-
- you could style him. <i> 
- Yeah, 'cause you need</i> <i> some help.</i> 
- Oh! 
- You know what? Okay. Okay, Truth. 
- We'll see you tomorrow, Truth. <i> 
- All right, bye.</i> 
- I'm not sure Truth is telling the truth. 
- Really? 
- Something's not computing. 
- You think he's leaving something out? ■@■Yes. 
- All right, well, I'll see you in the morning and we'll find out. Come ready for a makeover. <i>

- Hey. 
- Hello! 
- Hey, what's up? 
- How's it going? 
- This morning I actually really was thinking about what I was wearing, because you were ripping me yesterday. 
- Okay. Okay. 
- Oh, here we go. 
- I made all of these. 
- You made all these? 
- Yeah. I'm about to be famous. 
- All right, well, we gotta have a show. 
- We need music. 
- Oh, he takes it off. Whoa. <i> 
- [Music] Everybody wants</i> <i> to be famous [Music]</i> <i> [Music] Everybody wants [Music]</i> 
- So here we are. You gave us, like, a little description 
- Right. of 
- Your friend invites youn. into this group chat. 
- Kevon. 
- Well, we're not friends. He's, like, fake. 
- Fake, like, not the person-
- 
- No, like a fake person. Like... 
- Right. 
- Somebody that... 
- He's not a good person-
- 
- He's just... 
- Got it. 
- 'Cause, like, he's, like, in the industry, like, styling, but, 
- All right. So. Like, just kinda take us back to that first day when you first sort of set your eyes on Ray'Quan. 
- Okay, so, we were, like, in this group chat on Instagram. And we were, like, sending memes and fashion stuff. After, like, a week of doing that, I was like, Okay, w■; D getting to know each other or what do you like to do, what I like to do. Like, I was venting and telling him about my life, what I want to■■■■■■■■■■I am and stuff t. Majority of the time we're on the phone, I talk more than him. That's why I say he's a great listener. 
- Do you generally not have a lot of people around you who you feel like you can confide in? 
- I live in LA. This is the land of the fake and the phony. 
- Well, let's talk about that for a second. So, 'cause, here you are in Los Angeles, one of the hubs of gay community. 
- Mm-hmm. 
- Can't you find someone you'd be interested in here? 
- Because I've kinda-
- I've been dating somebody else. 
- Okay. Okay. 
- Okay. 
- There we go. 
- Spill the tea. 
- It's a girl. both: Oh. 
- Is that, like, kind of a serious thing, or... 
- Yeah, we've been dating for a year. 
- Really? Does she know about... 
- No. 
- Ray'Quan? 
- You do like the drama. 
- The drama likes me. I don't like drama. Drama likes me. 
- Are you guys, like, taking a break, or... 
- No. But Cierra just went back home for, like, six months, and then she's gonna come back. I was like, well, might as well try to... see what's up with him 'cause she's gonna be gone for a while. And I'm, like, bored-
- I don't want to be bored. 
- Does Ray'Quan know that you have a girlfriend? 
- No. 
- Does Cierra think you guys are exclusive and monogamous? 
- Yes. 
- Does Cierra know that you also date men? 
- No. But I love both of them. We could all be a throuple. I think we could be, like, I want to be with the both of them. 
- Okay. 
- Do you think she'd be down? 
- You never know. 
- Wow. 
- Cierra makes you happy? 
- Yeah, she's, like, really good. Like, to talk to too, and-
- 
- So why--what's stopping commitment? 
- I'm only 23, and I'm not trying to be, like, married right now. 
- Fair. 
- Yeah. But I do think Cierra deserves the respect of being kinda filled in on the situation. While we want to help you, we also don't wanna participate in what Cierra would probably think of as cheating. It'd be nice, I think, to kinda fill her in. So think about how and when you want to do that. 
- Okay. 
- Okay. Can we see a picture of Ray'Quan? 
- Okay. 
- Show us your... 
- Your profile. 
- Your conversation with him. 
- This is my. That's me. Y'all know that's me. 
- Oh, you got 38,000 followers? 
- Yeah, I'm lit. You know. 
- You got 38,000? 
- Okay, okay. 
- Look at me. I'm lit. 
- You got more than me. 
- Yeah. 
- And can you show us-
- 
- Cierra? 
- Yeah. So this is her page. She's very pretty. 
- I made that. 
- Oh.You made tha. 
- You made that? 
- Wow. 
- You are very talented. 
- And show us, uh, Ray'Quan. Is that him, or? 
- Yeah. 
- Okay. He's a good-looking guy. 
- Can we look at the messages? 
- Okay. We was, like, sending different memes, and, like... We were texting earlier and I was like, Can you call me on your break? He's been mean lately. He gets so mad when I call him babe or bae. 
- That's interesting. 
- I ow why he be acting like that. He's just a private person. 
- I mean, is it possible-
- have you ever considered that maybe he's not that into you? 
- I think y'all are reaching. 
- You guys ever say I love you? 
- I say it, but he'd be like, Yeah... 
- Like on the phone? 
- Yeah. He'd be like, Uh-huh. Bye. 
- Oh. 
- He's never said it back. 
- No, not that I can recollect. No. 
- We've got our work cut ou Send us an email with everybody's profiles. We'll see what we can find and we'll meet back up tomorrow. I'm ready to dive in.

- All right. [groans] ■÷started, let's have a little treat. 
- Can we cheers? To Truth! 
- Oh, yours, yours is, like, giant compared to mine. 
- [laughing] 
- Let's just recap. 
- Mm-kay. Truth, 23 years old, let's call him bisexual. He has Ray'Quan. 
- Met him on Instagram in a group chat. 
- And they were introduced by... 
- A guy named Kevon. 
- Kevon. Truth is currently dating a girl, Cierra, for a year. 
- He's dating two people. So now we've gotta figure out, who is Ray'Quan? Is he the guy in the pictures who lives in New Jersey or someone else? Quite a debacle. 
- It is. 
- It's a mess. 
- Truth sent an email. Mm-kay. 
- Ray'Quan's phone number, his Instagram. Selfie.gawdd. I don't have a number for Kevon-
- right, 'cause they've never met in person-
- But here's his Instagram. Okay, let's just search Ray'Quan's phone number. We'll do a quick search here... See what we get. No name. 
- Trenton, New Jersey, however. 
- Okay, New Jersey checks out. All right, so here are pictures of Ray'Quan. And let's see if any of these come up. A All right. First one. both: No. Second pic. Okay, nothing. Last picture. 
- Oh--no. 
- Nothing on the pictures. So let's just look a little bit at his Instagram. This is Ray'Quan's Instagram. Selfie.gawdd. 
- Six pictures. How many followers does he have? I mean, this feels like a fake account. 
- Let's look at the comments. 
- Yeah, let's go to the first post. All right. Here we go. This guy, hymnsofly, commented on Ray'Quan's oldest picture. 
- The oldest picture. Is he commenting on anything else? 
- Yes, the most recent photo. Hymnsofly, 3 more weeks I can't wait. Maybe they know each other in real life. 
- Who's hymnsofly? 
- Yeah. His name is Dedrick. 
- Private account. 
- But we could message and just say, like, How do you know Ray'Quan? Let's try hymnsofly. 
- Hymnsofly... 
- All right. [chime] All right, so we sent a message to Dedrick. So let's just look to see if Ray'Quan is tagged on Instagram. Is he tagged in anything? Okay, so this guy tagged Ray'Quan in a photo. commented I miss you. Who is this? 
- That's Kevon. That's the friend. 
- You're right! So wait a second. 
- That's Kevon. 
- So there it is. 
- So Kevon... is in a picture and personally knows Ray'Quan. 
- This is a big deal. 's huge. 
- That is huge. 
- Okay. We need to message Kevon. If he can confirm that he does, in fact, know Ray'Quan, that'd be huge. So sending. All right, great. Okay, so now we've got messages out to Dedrick and this other guy, Kevon, who... 
- Yes. 
- Is the link. 
- Who's the link. 
- And in the photo with Ray'Quan. 
- We've not searched for Kevon on Facebook. 000■■right, let's do that. Oh, yeah, there he is. -employed... 
- Let's just see what's on his page. Wait, what's this? Kevon was in Trenton. 
- Okay, Kevon was in Trenton. Coming home tomorrow. 
- Wait a second. Trenton. Exactly the same as Ray'Quan. Huh. Oh. Whoa! Holy [bleep]. Kevon's Facebook-
- t the URL. x■íWk■÷■ 
- Oh, boy. 
- Kevon's Facebook URL is selfie.gawdd. ■■■/■■■s= It's almost the exact same thing as Ray'Quan's Instagram. That right there is almost enough to sort of...close the case. 
- Truth has never hung out with Kevon. 
- Right, so he hasn't really heard his voice. 
- And has never talked to him. 
- Right. 
- I bet you Ray'Quan doesn't exist, right? 
- Truth's been talking to Kevon... % %ght. He % %on 
- Truth's been talking The one thing that, like,evon... Truth has said-
- 
- Truth was adamant about. 
- Is that, Oh■tand Kev 
- Right. Kevon's, like, he's a mess. ■■■■He's always, like, in people's business. And now there's a good chance Kevon and Ray'Quan are the same person. [phone ringing] Oh. From Annapolis, Maryland. <i> 
- Hello?</i> 
- Yeah, hey, who's this? 
- Dedrick. Are you hymnsofly? 
- Hey, what's up? We're talking to someone who's been texting and talking to your friend Ray'Quan. You commented on one of his photos. <i> 
- Yeah.</i> 
- Do you know him in real life? 
- Can you tell us a little bit about him? [phone beeping] 
- Oh. Did he just hang up? Should we call him back? 
- Yeah. <i> 
- Your call has been forwarded</i> <i> to an automatic...</i> 
- Shady. No call back, goes straight to voicemail, like... Could this just be Kevon? One of his many characters? This could get really ugly. 
- It's malicious. 
- All right, so, look. So here's what we know. We know that Kevon was the connection between Ray'Quan and Truth. 
- Kevon has the same Facebook... 
- URL. 
- URL as Ray'Quan's Instagram. 
- So there's a good chance the Ray'Quan Instagram page is fake and Ray'Quan was created by Kevon. But Ray'Quan is tagged in a photo with Kevon in it, so the guy in the picture is just someone Kevon knows, but that's not Ray'Quan. his profile. 
- This is not his profile. You know, you have a circle of people who all connect together. And maybe people are trying to blow up Truth's life. You see Brad, songs are really about big life moments. Baby shower here. Big. Life. Moment. What is in here? Ohh! Oh, I hope it's a life insurance policy. What? It's a sensible gift. Protection for you and your family, Nationwide has all the tools to help you find the right coverage. Tiny baby shoes. So close. Makes no sense. Should have been a life insurance policy.

- Hey, Truth.</i> <i> We've got a little bit</i> <i> of a situation here.</i> <i> We have some things</i> <i> to tell you.</i> <i> So where do you want</i> <i> to meet up?</i> <i> 
- Can we come there and talk?</i> <i> 
- All right, man,</i> <i> we'll see you soon.</i> 
- Hello? 
- I'm back here, hey. 
- Wow. 
- Good to see you. 
- Whoa. This is cool. All right, well, come on, we got-
- we got a lot to talk about. Why don't we just show you what we found, and then we can decide what we wanna do. 
- Right. 
- So yesterday you sent us this email. 
- You had given us Ray'Quan's number. 
- Right. So we did a search to see if that number is registered to someone. 
- Okay. 
- And no name associated with this number. But Trenton, which makes sense. And then we just thought, let's see if he's tagged in any photos. He's tagged in two pictures. 
- Okay. 
- And one of them... 
- Is with Kevon. 
- Is with Kevon. 
- Okay. 
- So we sent him a message. And we searched just to see if Kevon had a Facebook. And we found that he does. But, more interestx he's o, exactly the same as Ray'Quan. And then, check this out, we looked at his URL... His Facebook page is selfie.gawdd.x c■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ ■■■■■■ Instagram is selfie.gawdd.x. 
- Okay, what? So what you saying-
- this is Kevon. So he's playing in my face? Like, what's going on? Is--is that-
- It's--like, what is--what is going on? 
- Kevon is the one that invited you to the chat. And Ray'Quan's Instagram page and Kevon's Facebook page have almost identical URLs. So Kevon could be the guy you're talking to. Then... 
- Today, Kevon finally answered. 
- He messaged me back on Instagram. So let me show you these messages from Kevon. 
- I can't believe he thought this was so serious that he had to get Catfish involved. Oh, Lord. 
- And he suggested meeting up this morning. 
- So we showed up. 
- And he, like, bailed on us after we got t We tried calling, but no answer. 
- Okay. 
- So that's when we called you and came over here. Is there any chance Kevon has a crush on you and likes you? 
- He ain't never told me that. 
- Well, right, but if he had, would you have been nice about it? 
- No, I wouldn't. 
- Well, you might not have gone out with him, but you wouldn't have, like, been mean to him, right? 
- Yeah, I would. 
- You would've. But then there's alsoith ■ this profile. This guy, hymnsofly, AKA Dedrick, who commented on Ray'Quan's pictures-
- does he look familiar at all? 
- Um, he might have been in that group chat too. 
- We messaged him. And he called us yesterday. And we were just starting to talk, and then click, it, like, got disconnected. 
- Got disconnected? 
- Yeah. Sketchy. 
- Multiple people might be in on this. 
- I don't even know these, like, him and this other guy-
- I'm really like-
- like■■■■Ñ■Ñ■ÑLike... I'm gonna look dumb. Like, I already look dumb. I don't know him. We ain't friends. Like, seem like they obsessed with me. It just, like, seem like they clout chasing, like they wanna be pophing off of my expense. I gotta go outside. I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

- I'm abe like... on TV looking crazy right now. Like, I just need some water.

- Okay, good. I know this is a lot for you. We
- Yeah.k.■ 
- So I guess at this point... we call Ray'Quan. 
- Okay. 
- See what he wants to do. Let him know we're doing the show. Let him know we want to meet up. See if we can make that happen. See what he says. 
- Okay. [phone ringing] <i> 
- Please leave</i> <i> your message for...</i> 
- Just... hold on, let me text him. If it's green, that mean they blocked you. Oh, it is green! 
- Blocked. 
- Oh, [bleep]. 
- So you're blocked. Officially. 
- Let's text Ray'Quan from my phone. Hey, Ray'Quan, this is Nev. I understand a lot's going on right now, so we're hoping we could all meet up and figure this out. Delivered. We're bound to hear back from someone at some point. And if we don't, we'll meet up tomorrow morning, and if we have to roll up on Kevon somewhere or... whatever it takes. 
- But you definitely still need to let Cierra know... what's going on. 
- If people are starting to hear about this, it could get to her. So...sleep on it. 
- Mm-kay. 
- Okay. 
- All right. Hang in there. 
- Okay. I'ma try. 
- All right. <i> We're almost worse off</i> <i> than we were when we started.</i> 
- Now we got Kevon, who seems to be going dark, Ray'Quan...Truth. 
- Blocked Truth. 
- I mean, this could be a really malicious effort by someone to ruin Truth's life. 
- It doesn't feel romantic. [phone beeps] [phone beeping] 
- Okay. Ray'Quan texted. Please don't keep hitting up close friends and asking them questions about me. I'm over all of this and I want it to stop. I know you're in LA with Truth so I'm gonna come to you. I'll let you know where to meet me once I figure it out. Someone's showing up tomorrow, but I have no idea who it's gonna be. When I had acne, I made up a lot of excuses not to go out. I am ill. You know, I'm trying to be less popular these days. It's just, like, not a good day for me, work-wise. I have jury duty. Tonight.
