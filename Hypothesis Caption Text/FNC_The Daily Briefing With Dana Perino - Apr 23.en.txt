 THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
 WATCHING "OUTNUMBERED OVERTIME""
 I'M IN FOR HARRIS FAULKNER.■1■/.
 Dana: YES, "THE DAILY
 BRIEFING" STARTS NOW.
 THREE BIG STORIES TO START
 FINALLY, THE WAITING GAME IS
 OVER.
 UP NEW DETAILS ABOUT JOE BIDEN'S
 MUCH-ANTICIPATED AND TALKED
 ABOUT.
  SYRIA       ZERO ONE, A NEW WAG
 TO TERRORISTS.

 PLAYING OUT DURING ORAL
 ARGUMENTS.
 SOME JUSTICES SEEM■>■■ SHOW
 SUPPORT FOR INCLUDING EXISTS,
 CITIZENSHIP QUESTION AND THE
 2,020 CENSUS.
 THIS IS GETTING A LOT OF
 ATTENTION.
 THERE ARE PROTESTERS THERE AND A
 BIG ARGUMENT TODAY.
 MOST OF THEM WALKED AWAY FOR
 NOW BECAUSE I ARGUMENTS ARE OVER
 BUT THEY WERE THERE EN MASSE
 EARLIER THIS MORNING.
 THIS COULD BE THE BIGGEST TEST
 OF THE HIGH COURT'S NEW
 CONSERVATIVE MAJORITY TO DATE.
 PARTISAN LINES DEVELOP VERY
 QUICKLY DURING ORAL ARGUMENTS
 THIS MORNING, AND THAT THEY
 PRESS THE LAWYERS FOR THE
 JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO EXPLAIN
 WHY THE ARGUMENT WANTS TO
 INCLUDE, ARE YOU AT A CITIZEN OF
 THE UNITED STATES ON ITS 2020
 CENSUS.
 THE LIBERAL SCIENCES SAY IF THE
 QUESTION IS INCLUDED AS MANY AS
 6.5 MILLION PEOPLE MAY NOT
 PARTICIPATE IN THE CENSUS.
 CONSERVATIVE ASK IF IT WOULD
 CAUSE AN INACCURATE CENSUS.
 INCLUDING A PERSON'S AGE AND.
 INDEED, THE QUESTION HAD BEEN ON
 PREVIOUS CENSUSES FOR ALMOST 200
 YEARS.
 THE QUESTION WAS ASKED IN
 CENSUSES FROM31950.9■9■9■9■Y%Y%■
 ■■AS IT DOE AMIDST THE■■
 HEATED DEBATE, THEY ARE ADAMANT
 IT NOT BE INCLUDED EVEN THE FACT
 THAT IT IS ILLEGAL FOR THE
 CENSUS BUREAU TO USE THAT
 SURVEYS "FOR ANY INFORMATION
 WHICH IDENTIFIES A PERSON OR A
 BUSINESS.
 WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A
 CONSPIRACY THEORIST TO BE
 CONCERNED THAT IF THAT DATA IS
 OUT THERE IT COULD POSE A RISK
 TO YOU.
 WE HAVE SEEN AN ADMINISTRATION
 THAT IS PICKING PEOPLE UP IN
 SENSITIVE PLACES LIKE COURT
 HOUSES, SCHOOLS, GOING TO THE
 DOCTOR'S OFFICE.
 THE RAMIFICATIONS OF AND
 UNDERCOUNT ARE HUGE AND OF THE
 CENSUS WILL DETERMINE HOW MANY
 ELECTORAL VOTE'S THE STATE HAS.
 HOW MANY CONGRESSIONAL MEMBERS
 OF THE STATE HAS AND HOW FEDERAL
 RESOURCES ARE DEBATED OUT TO THE
 STATES.
 THE COURT WILL HAVE TO RULED BY
 THE END OF IT SESSION THE
 TRADITIONAL DEADLINE, THAT OF
 PRINTING OFFICE WHICH
 HAVE TO HAVE■÷■y■■■■ THEM MEET E
 CENSUS WHICH GETS UNDERWAY.
 THANKS FOR THAT REPORT.
 LET'S BRING OUR OWN BRET BAIER,
 ALWAYS GLAD TO HAVE YOU ON THE
 SHOW.
 SO THERE IS THE REPORT THAT DOUG
 HAD AND THEN THERE'S ALSO THIS
 FROM THE FORMER SOLICITOR
 GENERAL.
 HE WAS THERE, AND HE TWEETED
 THIS.
 JUST COMING OUT OF CENSUS
 ARGUMENT SCOTUS.
 INTERESTING THAT TRUMP SOLICITOR
 GENERAL CRITICIZED SEVERAL
 JUSTICES FOR THE VERY SAME THING
 AS AG BARR CRITICIZED WITH A FEW
 SELECT FACTS FROM THE RECORD AND
 IGNORING THE REST.
 MUST BE SOMETHING IN THE WATER.
 SO AS THESE THINGS GO EVERYONE
 TRIES TO REBUILD TEA LEAVES OF
 WHAT THE JUSTICES MIGHT DO.
 Bret: IT'S DANGEROUS TO DO
 JUST BY ORAL ARGUMENTS.
 SOMETIMES THE JUSTICES HAVE THE
 WAY THAT THEY GO ABOUT IT BY
 ASKING QUESTIONS THE OTHER WAY,
 AND THEY MAY COME DOWN ON THE
 ACTUAL CASE.
 THAT ASIDE, THEY DID SEEM THAT
 THE CONSERVATIVE LEADING
 JUSTICES ON THE COURT ARE SIDING
 WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND
 EVERYTHING THEY ARE SAYING AND
 ASKING AND IT LOOKS LIKE THEY
 COULD SET UP TO A 5-4 RULING TO
 ALLOW THE CENSUS QUESTION TO GO
 FORWARD.
 HIS CONTROVERSIAL, THERE'S ALL
 KINDS OF PUSHBACK BUT THE BOTTOM
 LINE ARGUMENT FROM THAT SIDE IS,
 YOU NEED AN ACCURATE COUNT AND
 THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT DEMANDS IT
 ACCORDING TO THE PEOPLE WHO
 SUPPORT THAT.
 Dana: I READ A LOT OF THE
 BACK AND FORTH ON THAT TODAY AND
 FROM THE LEFT SIDE LOOKING AT
 IT, THEY ARE MAKING VERY
 TECHNICAL ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE
 LAW AND THE SPECIFICS OF THE
 ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT
 AND WHAT THE SECRETARY OF
 COMMERCE DID OR DID NOT DO.
 THE QUESTION FOR VOTERS WILL BE,
 WHY WOULD YOU NOT ASK THAT?
 HE WAS ASKED UP UNTIL 1950.
 Bret: AND THE OTHER
 PUSHBACK IS THAT THEY WOULD BE
 INTIMIDATING PEOPLE BY NOT
 GETTING AS MANY RESPONDENTS, BUT
 THEY DO WANT TO KNOW THE
 CITIZENSHIP QUESTIONS.
 SO THE BALANCE -WHETHER YOU
 INTIMIDATE PEOPLE OR DON'T GET
 AS MANY WERE IT'S MORE AND
 THEREBY BETTER FOR THE
 GOVERNMENT.
 Dana: THE OTHER THING THAT
 WE FOUND OUT TODAY AS THERE IS
 NO CONFIRMATION THAT JOE BIDEN
 WILL BE ANNOUNCING HIS
 PRESIDENTIAL RUN THIS THURSDAY,
 AND THERE IS A MONMOUTH POLL
 THAT JUST CAME OUT THAT SHOWS
 THAT HE IS STILL ON TOP.
 BUT STILL AT 27%.
 I KNOW A LOT OF THAT IS NAME
 I.D. BUT DO YOU THINK HE CAN
 HOLD ONTO THAT AFTER HE
 ANNOUNCES ON THURSDAY, OR IS
 THURSDAY GOING TO BE THE BEST
 DAY OF HIS CAMPAIGN AND EVERYONE
 WILL PYLON?
 Bret: I THINK THAT'S REALLY
 THE BIGGEST QUESTION AND A LOT
 WILL DETERMINE HOW HE HANDLES
 THIS EARLY TIME.
 BEING ON TV AND BOUNCING A
 OHIO, NEW HAMPSHIRE AND
 ELSEWHERE FOR A WHILE.
 I THINK THIS LAUNCH WAS A
 COMBINATION OF BOTH BAD
 REPORTING AND MAYBE SOME BAD
 STAFF WORK THAT WE THOUGHT WAS
 GOING TO BE WEDNESDAY.
 WE THOUGHT IT COULD BE
 CHARLOTTESVILLE, VIRGINIA, AND
 NOW THERE WAS A DECISION THAT
 IT'S NOT GOING TO BE SOME OF
 THAT.
 THE VIDEO ROOM LAUNCH OUT OF
 THE UNION HALL, OBVIOUSLY MAKING
 A BIG MESSAGE IS WHERE THE MIC
 DECIDING WHERE HE'S GOING TO GO
 WITH THAT.
 WHEN HE A COUPLE WEEKS AGO WAS
 GOING THROUGH ALL THE QUESTIONS
 ABOUT HIM BEING TOO TOUCHY,
 THERE WERE QUESTIONS LIKE, WHY
 IS PRESIDENT OBAMA NOT COMING
 OUT TO DEFEND HIM?
 PRESIDENT REAGAN DID NOT COME
 OUT UNTIL AFTER THE PRIMARY
 PROCESS WAS FINISHED FOR 41 WHEN
 HE WAS RUNNING AND BILL CLINTON
 DIDN'T DO THAT EITHER FOR
 AL GORE.
 I GUESS THE FORMER PRESIDENT
 THINKS THAT THEY HAVE TO WIN IT
 ON THEIR OWN?
 I THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL
 STAY BACK AS FAR AS THE
 ENDORSEMENT OF ONE CANDIDATE.
 I THINK THE QUESTION MORE WAS A
 CHARACTER ASSASSINATION, AND
 WHAT THERE BE -USE A LISTEN.
 JOE IS LIKE THAT.
 I'M NOT ENDORSING HIM AS
 PRESIDENT BUT I'M ENDORSING HIM
 AND HIS CHARACTER.
 I THINK THE OBAMA FOLKS MAY BE
 SPLIT AND I'M NOT SURE THAT
 PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL ENDORSE
 JOE BIDEN IN THE END.
 Dana: YOU DON'T THINK EVEN
 AT THE END, LIKE IF HE WERE TO
 SECURE THE NOMINATION?
 Bret: OF COURSE IF HE
 SECURES THE NOMINATION.
 Dana: MY LAST QUESTION,
 MAYOR PETE, HE JUST ANNOUNCED
 THERE WOULD BE A TOWN HALL.
 Bret: YES MAY 19 WITH
 CHRIS WALLACE.
 THAT WILL BE A GREAT TOWN HALL,
 AND WE HAVE BERNIE SANDERS, AMY
 KLOBUCHAR IS COMING UP WITH
 MARTHA AND ME IN MILWAUKEE ON
 MAY 8TH AND THEN, MAY 19TH IS
 MAYOR PETE.
 Dana: WE WILL HAVE TO GET
 JOE BIDEN ON THE BANDWAGON.
 BRET BAIER, THANK YOU.

 Dana: IN JUST TWO DAYS, JOE BIDEN WILL BE■■■■■■■■ OFFICN
 THE 2020 DEMOCRATIC RACE.
 DELIBERATIONS BACK AND FORTH
 ABOUT HIS ANNOUNCEMENT AFFECTED
 HIS ROLLOUT.
 MASTER OF COMMUNICATIONS, WE
 WANTED TO GET YOUR TAKE ON THIS.
 DO YOU THINK THIS WAS A PROBLEM
 THAT HE'S ON-AGAIN, OFF-AGAIN OR
 MAYBE WE WERE KEPT IN THE DARK
 BUT HE'S GOING TO BE IN ON
 THURSDAY?
 I THINK IT'S A PROBLEM.
 PEOPLE TENDED TO WANT THE OPTION
 THAT THEY DON'T HAVE AND THEN
 THEY GET THE OPTION, AND THEY
 SAY, I'M DISAPPOINTED.
 THAT COULD'VE BEEN HANDLED
 DIFFERENTLY.
 BUT I THINK THAT IS A SHORT-TERM
 PROBLEM.
 I ALSO THINK A SHORT-TERM
 PROBLEM IS BIDEN THIS JUGGERNAUT
 IS GOING TO GET IN THE RACE AND
 HE WILL FIND HIMSELF TALKING
 ABOUT BACK MASSAGES AND HE WILL
 TRY TO TALK ABOUT SERIOUS ISSUES
 AND THE MEDIA AND THE PUBLIC ARE
 GOING TOj> SAY, ABOUT THOSE BACK
 MASSAGES.
 IN ONE OF THE REASONS THAT
 HAPPENS, IF WE WANT IT TO
 HAPPEN, WE WAN
 AANDIDATE C TAKE HIS
 BEATING.
 THAT I THINK IT'S A BAD NEWS FO
 HIM.
 I THINK THE GOOD NEWS FOR HIM IS
 ENTERING A CLIMATE WHERE THE
 DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS BASICALLY
 BECOME THIS VICTIM'S JUBILEE AND
 IF HE CAN STANDUT AMONG THESE
 DRIVEN THAT CAN GIVS TO
 DEMOCRATIC■& VOTER AND GIVE THEM
 THE OPTION.
 IT'S LIKE, HE'S RUN MANY
 TIMES AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY
 HAS TRANSFORMED EVEN JUST IN A
 FEW YEARS SINCE BARACK OBAMA AND
 JOE BIDEN WERE IN THE
 WHITE HOUSE.
 HE'S GOING TO BE ASKED, HAVE YOU
 MISSED YOUR MOMENT?
 AND HOW DO YOU ANSWER SOMETHING
 LIKE THAT?
 SURPRISE IS ALWAYS BETTER.
 IT GETS BACK TO THE SEINFELD AND
 "THE SOPRANOS" ENDING.
 THE FACT THAT WE SPEND A YEAR
 WAITING FOR THE ENDING, WE ARE
 GUARANTEED DISAPPOINTMENT.
 I THINK THAT BIDEN'S BEST OPTION
 IS TO NOT SPEND TOO MUCH TIME
 ADDRESSING IT AND TALKING ABOUT
 THINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE WORRIED
 ABOUT AND I THINK HIS CHALLENGE
 IS GOING TO BE, HE'S GOING TO
 WANT TO BE A STATESMAN IN AN ERA
 WHO COULD CARE LESS ABOUT
 STATESMEN.
 HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO GET BACK
 TO THIS GUTTER STUFF THAT HE
 REALLY DOESN'T WANT.
 I THINK ONE THING THAT HE'S GOOD
 AT IS WHAT WE DO IN OUR BUSINESS
 WHICH IS TRANSITIONING.
 WE DON'T REALLY SPEND A LOT OF
 TIME TALKING ABOUT THINGS THAT
 YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE TALKING TO
 AND GET TO THE THINGS THAT YOU
 WANT TO TALK ABOUT AND THAT
 EVENTUALLY WILL HAPPEN.
 DO YOU THINK THAT DEMOCRATIC
 SUPPORTERS WHICH ARE WAITING IN
 THE WINGS TO ENDORSE SOMEONE
 WILL DO SO RIGHT AWAY OR WILL
 THEY WAIT AND WATCH THIS PRIMARY
 PROCESS PLAY OUT?
 I THINK THEY HAVE TO WAIT
 UNTIL IT PLAYS OUT BECAUSE
 NOBODY THOUGHT THAT TRUMP WOULD
 EMERGE SUCCESSFULLY FROM THE
 PRIMARY PROCESS AND IT'S NOT AS
 YOU SAID BEFORE THE BREAK
 HISTORICALLY, SITTING PRESIDENTS
 DON'T COME OUT AND EMBRACE THEIR
 PARTY'S CANDIDATE.
 THAT'S MUCH CLOSER UNTIL THE
 END.
 RE OPERATING IN A CLIMATE TO
 ASK OURSELVES QUESTIONS.
 IF BIDEN WAVES HIS HAND IN THE
 WRONG DIRECTION PEOPLE SAY WHAT
 DID THAT MEAN?
 WHEREAS I DON'T THINK PEOPLE DID
 THAT 30 YEARS AGO.
 Dana: THE OTHER QUESTION
 HE'S GOING TO BE ASKED IS, ARE
 YOU TOO OLD TO RUN?
 WHAT'S THE WAY TO COMBAT THAT IF
 YOU ARE BIDEN.
 IS IT SHOW, NOT EXPLAIN?
 ABSOLUTELY.
 I THINK WHERE REAGAN KILLED THAT
 IS EVERYBODY WAS EXPECTING AND
 ELDERLY DODDERING FIGURE BUT
 WHEN YOU SAW THAT IN ACTION, HE
 DIDN'T LOOK THAT WAY AND HE
 DIDN'T SOUND THAT WAY.
 I THINK HE COMES ACROSS AS A LOT
 YOUNGER.
 I THINK THE OTHER THING HE HAS
 GOING FOR HIM DESPITE ALL OF THE
 BACK MASSAGE TALKS IS, HE HAS A
 REAGAN QUALITY WHERE PEOPLE MAY
 EVENTUALLY SAY HE DOES STUFF
 LIKE THAT.
 I REMEMBER IN MY EARLY 20s AS
 A YOUNG AIDE IN REAGAN'S
 WHITE HOUSE, WHEN REAGAN WOULD
 SAY SOMETHING LIKE TREES CAUSE
 POLLUTION, THE DEMOCRATS THOUGHT
 THAT WAS THE END OF THE WORLD
 AND EVERYONE ELSE SAID, HE JUST
 DOES STUFF LIKE THAT.
 I DON'T THINK IN THE END BIDEN'S
 BEHAVIOR RISES TO THE WEINSTEIN
 LEVEL AND I THINK THAT MAYBE ONE
 THING HE HAS GOING FOR HIM.
 Dana: ARGUE AGING IN
 REVERSE.
 IF YOU WERE IN THE EARLY 20s
 IN THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION?
 YES, I WAS AN EMBRYO.
 STATEMENT OF THANK YOU.
 I HAD, WHAT CAUSES MORE HARM TO
 THE COUNTRY THAN RUSSIA'S
 ELECTION INTERFERENCE?
 CLUSTERED FELONS AND TERRORISTS
 HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE WHILE
 BEHIND BARS?
 WHY 12020 CONTENDERS SAYS, YES.
     tched for value.
            For family.
      For power.
      It was time to upgrade.
 I switchedm to Chevy.      For power.
 <i>See why people are</i> <i>switching to Chevy.</i>
        We love our Chevy.
    I love my    Malibu.
           My Colorado.
            My Camaro.
           My Traverse.
        Why did we switch?
         Just look at it.



        Hey, who are you?
 Oh, hey Jeff, I'm a car thief...
              What?!
           I'm here to     steal your car because,
       well, that's my job.
              What?
              What??
              WHAT?!
              What??
              WHAT?!
              What?!
             [crash]
              WHAT?!
        Haha, it happens.
        And if you've got     cut-rate car insurance,
      paying for this could
 feel like getting robbed twice.
        So get Allstate...
     and be better protected
          from Mayhem...

 Dana: HUNDREDS OF SOUTH AMERICAN MIGRANTS ON THE
 WAY THROUGH MEXICO HAVE BEEN
 ■8■8 THEIR WAY TO
 TH BORDER.
 IT'S THE LARGEST SINGLE RAID ON
 A CARAVAN SINCE A GROUP STARTED
 MAKING THEIR WAY THROUGH MEXICO
 LAST YEAR.
 JONATHAN, HOW DID THIS PLAY OUT?
 IT APPEARED TO BE A CONCERTED
 EFFORT BY MEXICAN AUTHORITIES TO
 SEND A SIGNAL THAT THEY WILL NO
 LONGER BE SO ACCOMMODATING TO
 THE THOUSANDS OF
 FROM CENTRAL AMERICA AND HEADI■■
 TO THE U.S. BORDER.
 ■■O■ HEREK7
 YOU SEE THERE, THE MIGRANTS
 GHTING BACK WITH STICKS AS
 POLICE BEGAN A CLEARLY
 WELL-PLANNED OPERATION ISOLATING
 A GROUP FROM HUNDREDS OF
 EXHAUSTED MIGRANTS AS THEY TOOK
 A BREAK IN THE SHADE.
 OFFICERS GRABBING MEN, WOMEN AND
 CHILDREN TAKING THEM AWAY TO
 WAITING BUSES.
 SEPARATELY I ALSO WANTED TO SHOW
 THIS VIDEO FOR YOU.
 THIS WAS GIVEN TO YOU BY THE
 CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION
 OFFICIALS.
 WHAT IT SHOWS THEY SAY WAS SHOT
 ON THE ARIZONA MEXICO BORDER AND
 SHOWS HEAVILY ARMED SMUGGLERS.
 CBP SAYS IT IS A VERY CONCERNED
 TO SEE THOSE SORT OF WEAPONS IS
 NOW BEING BY HUMAN SMUGGLERS
 RIGHT ON THE BORDER AS YOU CAN
 SEE VERY PLAINLY THERE.
 THE WOMAN AND HER SON BY THE WAY
 WERE QUICKLY DETAINED BY CBP
 AGENTS.
 THOSE ARMED SMUGGLERS ARE STILL
 AT LARGE SOMEWHERE IN MEXICO
 DANA.
 Dana: AND WITHOUT OTHER
 STORY WITH MILITIA OPERATING ON
 THE SIDE OF THE BORDER, WHAT'S
 THE LATEST ON THAT?
 THE LEADER OF THAT GROUP HAS
 ANOTHER DATE IN COURT ON MONDAY.
 LARRY HOPKINS WAS HELD ON
 FIREARMS CHARGES.
 AND HOLDING THEM UNTIL REAL
 BORDER PATROL AGENTS COULD EVEN
 GET THERE.

 THAT WENT ON "UNDER THE GUISE OF
 CITIZENS PATROLS SUPPORTING CBP.
 AS WE REPORTED HERE YESTERDAY,
 THEY SET IN THE WEEK, THAT
 CITIZENS SHOULD NOT BE TAKING
 THE LAW INTO THEIR HANDS AT ANY
 POINT AND IT SHOULD LEAVE A
 LAW ENFORCEMENT ALONG THE BORDER

 GOP■ AGENCIES.
 Dana: JONATHAN HUNT,
 THANK YOU.
 IT COULD BE THE SUPREME COURT'S
 BIGGEST CASE THIS TERM.
 THERE IS ANB APPEAL OVER WHETHER
 A CITIZENSHIP QUESTION COULD BE
 INCLUDED IN A 2020 CENSUS.
 THANKS FOR JOINING US HERE■■.
 CAN I START WITH THAT QUESTION
 THAT IS BEING POSED TON■ THE
 SUPREME COURT?
 DO YOU SUPPORT THE IDEA OF
 ASKING A CITIZENSHIP QUESTION ON
 THE CENSUS?
 THEY MADE IT CLEAR, IT'S
 GOING TO BE UP TO THE
 SUPREME COURT TO DECIDE WHETHER
 WE CAN MOVE FORWARD ON
 TO JONATHAN'S REPORT, IT
 SEEMS TO ME THAT THE MEXICAN
 LEGAL AUTHORITIES ARE DOING
 MORE, AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE
 PRESSURE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP
 HAS TRIED TO PUT ON THE MEXICANS
 TO DO SOMETHING.
 WE ARE DEALING WITH ORIGINAL
 PHENOMENON.
 SO ANY SOLUTION WE ARE GOING TO
 HAVE TO REDUCE THE FLOW IS GOING
 TO RELY.
 AND WE ASKED■■-■ FOR AND PROCEED

 LARGER GROUPS.■■■■■■■■
 THAT'S A REPORT THAT THE

 YOU'VE WORKED IN THE FIELD FOR A
 LONG TIME, WHAT ARE THE TWO
 THINGS THAT YOU THINK YOU NEED
 FROM CONGRESS THAT YOU MIGHT BE
 ABLE TO GET DONE THAT HELPS
 ACTUALLY ADDRESSED THE PROBLEM?
 I WOULD REFER TO A RECENT
 REPORT.
 THIS WAS A BIPARTISAN GROUP OF
 EXPERTS THAT RODE ON NONPARTISAN
 REPORT THAT THEY DECIDED WAS AN
 EMERGENCY.
 WE HAVE A CRISIS ON THE BORDER,
 AND WE NEED TO CHANGE OUR LEGAL
 FRAMEWORK AND OUR STRENGTH AND
 IMMIGRATION LAWS TO MAKE US
 EFFECTIVE.
 Dana: BUT IF YOU CAN'T GET
 THE COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION
 REFORM, IS THERE SOMETHING MORE
 SPECIFIC THAT YOU COULD USE?
 THERE IS.
 THE TWO TARGETED AREAS WE NEED
 TO, THAT'S A FEW SENTENCES OF
 LAW.
 AND SECONDLY THE ABILITY TO HAVE
 UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN OR BE
 ENTICED INTO THE SMUGGLING
 CYCLE, BEING ABLE TO REPATRIATE
 THEM
 ALSO ME ASK YOUúBOUTú

 WHEN I WAS DOJ INHERE YOU ARESPONSIBLE FOR
 HELPING TO PROTECT AMERICA FROM

 WE KNOW RUSSIA WAS TRYING TO
 INTERFERE.
 SO DHS HAS A BROAD SET OF
 RESPONSIBILITIES.
 I STARTED MY DAY IN
 NEW YORK CITY TALKING ABOUT
 THINGS THAT WE COULD DO TO
 PREPARE FOR THE 2020 ELECTION
 CYCLE, STATE AND LOCAL
 GOVERNMENTS, AND WE ARE FOCUSED
 ON THE 2020 PREPARATION.
 OUR CYBER SECURITY AND
 INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY AGENCY

 Dana: BECAUSE IN THE
 MUELLER REPORT THEY DID SAY THEY

 SEVERAL DEMOCRATS DISCUSSING
 LAST NIGHT DURING TOWN HALLS ON
 ANOTHER NETWORK.
 WE CAN'T HAVE COMPREHENSIVE
 IMMIGRATION REFORM THAT WORKS
 UNLESS IT ADDRESSES THE STATUS
 FOR THOSE 11 SOME MILLION
 UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS.
 SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS MAKE
 SURE THERE IS A PATHWAY TO
 CITIZENSHIP FOR THEM ALSO.
 FROM PROPERTY TAXES TO SALES
 TAXES.
 THE TRUTH IS, IN MANY RESPECTS
 BECAUSE THEY ARE N ELIGIBLE
 FOR A LOT OF BENEFITS, THEY ARE
 SUBSIDIZING THE REST OF US.
 THE EDITOR OF TownHall.com
 AND JESSICA Tw■w■
 FOONTRIBUTORT'ST TO H YOU THERE.
 IMMIGRATION IS BIG OUT THERE AND
 THE PATHWAY TO LET CITIZENSHIP,
 IS THAT A LITMUS TEST?
 I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S A
 DISTRACTION FOR DEMOCRATS AWAY
 FROM SOLVING THE CURRENT CRISIS
 OF THE BORDER.
 WHEN YOU SEE THOSE
 CENTRAL AMERICAN FAMILIES COMING
 AND YOU COME OFF INTO SOME BIG
 FAN, IN FACT YOU ARE CREATING A
 NEW ISSUE OF CITIZENSHIP IN TEN
 OR 15 YEARS WHEN YOU HAVE ALL OF
 THESE CHILDREN COME IN BY THE
 CHILDREN
 PARENTS ILLEGALLY THEN YOU GET
 THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THEY CAN
 STAY OR GO.
 THE TALKING POINT OF
 COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM
 DISTRACTS AWAY FROM HOW YOU
 HANDLED THAT SITUATION NOW AND
 HOWAKE SURE THIS CRISIS OF
 A MILLION PEOPLE FLOWI
 THE BORDER DOESN'T CONTINUE.
 Dana: SO IS THIS THE FLOOR
 LIKE YOU HAVE TO BE FOR THIS?
 I THINK SO.
 WHETHER IT'S HALFWAY TO
 CITIZENSHIP, A MAJORITY OF
 AMERICANS ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THA
 THAT.
 SO 100% I THINK THAT IS A LITMUS
 TEST AND THE REAL TEST WILL BE
 ONCE WE GET, AND WE DO GET
 QUESTIONS ABOUT THE BORDER, HOW
 YOU DEAL WITH THE ASYLUM SYSTEM
 AND WHAT YOU THINK SHOULD BE
 HAPPENING, WITH PEOPLE, I THINK
 FOR NOW DEMOCRATS -RE■■■■o■D
 THIS WAS ABOUT FELONS AND VOTING
 RIGHTS.
 WATCH THIS.
 DO YOU BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE
 WITH FELONY RECORDS SHOULD BE
 ALLOWED TO VOTE WHILE IN PRISON?
 DOES THIS MEAN THAT YOU WOULD
 SUPPORT IN FRANCHISING PEOPLE
 LIKE THE BOSTON MARATHON BOMBER?
 I THINK THE RIGHT TO VOTE WAS
 INHERENT TO OUR DEMOCRACY.
 YES, EVEN FOR TERRIBLE PEOPLE.
 FOR PEOPLE CONVICTED AND
 IMPRISONED, LIKE THE BOSTON
 MARATHON BOMBER, THE YOU THINK
 THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO VOTE?
 I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE THAT
 CONVERSATION.
 SHOULD PEOPLE CONVICTED OF
 SEXUAL ASSAULT, THE
 BOSTON MARATHON BOMBER, SHOULD
 THEY BE ABLE TO VOTE WHILE
 INCARC
 I DON'T THINK SO.
 Dana: WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF
 THAT?
 THE REACTION IN THE CROWD WAS
 THE BIG DEAL HERE.
 THEY POINTED OUT THIS MORNING
 THATTIMATED
 HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR
 CANDIDATES TO TAKE THE POPULAR
 POSITION EVEN IF IT DOESN'T
 SOUND RIGHT FOR THEM.
 IT SEEMS ANALOGOUS TO ME ALSO
 THAT THE CONVERSATION WE HAD
 ABOUT THIRD TRIMESTER ABORTION,
 IT WAS A VERY COMFORTABLE ONE TO
 HAVE.
 I THINK IT'S A COMPLICATED ISSUE
 AND IN VERMONT, THIS IS LEGAL.
 WE'VE HAD A SUPREME COURT
 DECISION, AND CITIZENSHIP IS NOT
 A RIGHT THAT EXPIRES UPON
 MISBEHAVIOR.
 I WONDER IF -INEQUITY IS THE
 CORE PROBLEM HERE, IF YOU CAN
 LOOK AT SOME SORT OF SYSTEM THAT
 HAS THE SLIDING SCALE.
 ALSO NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT
 THAT PEOPLE IN PRISON ARE OFTEN
 COUNTED INTO A POPULATION AND,
 THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE IS NOT
 INSTINCT -I DON'T EVEN THINK
 IT WAS PLANNING FOR THAT
 QUESTION.
 I'M VERY CURIOUS ABOUT THE BASE
 AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY RIGHT
 NOW IN THE PRIMARY PROCESS.
 WHO IS WANTING T BOSTON BOMBER
 TO BE VOTING FROM PRISON?
 IT'S VERY DIFFERENT.
 THERE IS A DEBATE TO BE HAD, IN
 A CONVERSATION AS KAMALA HARRIS
 WOULD SAY ABOUT WHETHER YOU GET
 YOUR RIGHTS BACK ONCE YOU'VE
 SERVED YOUR TIME.
 I WOULD ASK DEMOCRATS IF THAT
 ALSO APPLIES TO FIREARMS, PEOPLE
 GET THEIR FIREARMS          BACE
 SERVED TIME IN PRISON?
 BUTN I'M JUST NOT SUREDE■■Ff■■■A
 POLITICAL STRATEGY THERE.
 I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THE KAMALA
 HARRIS DECISION TO SAY, WE
 SHOULD HAVE THAT CONVERSATION.
 I MEAN, -I BELIEVE IT ACTUALLY
 TOOK A NUMBER OF HIM BY
 SURPRISE.
 BUT THAT WAS A CONVERSATION
 RESTORING VOTING RIGHTS.
 THEY ARE OVERWHELMINGLY PASSED
 AND A LOT OF REPUBLICANS VOTED
 FOR THAT AS WELL. YOU D■@ WATCHE
 TOWN HALL, AND I DID IT, SHE
 SAID SHE WAS READY TO HAVE A
 CONVERSATION ABOUT A NUMBER OF
 TOPICS AND SO I THINK THAT IS

 ■÷■÷ú■ú■ MUELLER REPORT IN A TA
 AT THE TIME 100 SUMMIT.
 DAVID LEE MILLER JOINS US WITH
 MORE.
 WHAT DID SHE HAVE TO SAY?
 THAT'S RIGHT.
 SPEAKING HERE IN NEW YORK CITY
 AT THIS TIMES SUMMIT HONORING
 THE 100 MOST INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE
 IN THE WORLD, HILLARY CLINTON
 WAS ASKED ABOUT THE MUELLER
 REPORT MOMENTS AGO.
 SHE SAID THIS IS A STORY THAT
 NEEDS TO BE TOLD OVER AND OVER
 AGAIN.
 LET'S LISTEN NOW TO SOME AFTER
 WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY.
 WE WERE THE SUBJECT OF A
 FOREIGN ADVERSARY'S ATTACK, AN
 ATTACK ON OUR ELECTION, AN
 ATTACK ON OUR SOVEREIGNTY AND
 OUR DEMOCRACY.
 THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT A
 RECKONING WITH THE RECENT PAST,
 THIS IS ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON
 TODAY AND THE THREATS TO OUR
 NEXT ELECTION TO OUR DEFENSE AS
 A NATION.
 MRS. CLINTON SAID THIS IS NOT
 THE END OF THE MATTER INVOKING
 THE WORDS OF WINSTON CHURCHILL.
 SHE SAID PERHAPS THIS IS THE END
 OF THE BEGINNING.
 THERE'S MORE TO FOLLOW.
 Dana: JARED KUSHNER SPOKE AS
 WELL?
 THAT'S RIGHT.
 WE ALSO HEARD FROM JARED
 KUSHNER, AN ADVISER TO THE
 PRESIDENT.
 HE DEFENDED THE ADMINISTRATION
 IN THE WAKE OF THE MUELLER
 REPORT.
 SPEAKING AT THIS TIME EVENT, THE
 ADVISER TO THE PRESIDENT, JARED
 KUSHNER SAID THE INVESTIGATION
 INTO THE RUSSIA INVOLVEMENT IN
 THE ELECTION HE SAID WAS A
 BIGGER PROBLEM THAN THE ACTUAL
 MEDDLING.
 LISTEN HERE.
 QUITE FRANKLY IT'S A BIG
 DISTRACTION TO THE Y.
 LOOK AT RUSSIA DID BUYING
 FACEBOOK ADS.
 IT'S A TERRIBLE THING BUT I
 THINK THE INVESTIGATIONS AND ALL
 OF THE SPECULATION THE LAST TWO
 YEARS HAS HAD A HARSHER IMPACT
 ON OUR DEMOCRACY THAN A COUPLE
 OF FACEBOOK ADS.
 LOOK AT WHAT THEY ACCOMPLISHED,
 THE ENSUING INVESTIGATIONS HAVE
 BEEN MORE HARMFUL.
 KUSHNER PLAYED THE
 INVESTIGATION ON SOME PEOPLE'S
 ABILITY TO ACCEPT MR. TRUMP WON
 AND BLAME THE RUSSIANS.
 IN HIS WORD, HE SAID WE SPENT
 TWO YEARS GOING THROUGH THAT
 NONSENSE.
 Dana: DID KUSHNER HAVE ANY
 OTHER NEWS?
 INDEED.
 HE WAS ASKED ABOUT A NUMBER OF
 SUBJECTS INCLUDING A MIDDLE EAST
 PEACE PLAN.
 THE PLAN WON'T BE PRESENTED
 UNTIL AFTER THE END OF RAMADAN.
 HE CALLED IT A TOUGH PROBLEM.
 WHILE HE DIDN'T GET INTO
 DETAILS, HE SAID THE PLAN WOULD
 TAKE WHAT HE CALLED AN
 UNCONVENTIONAL APPROACH.
 ON SAUDI ARABIA, THE U.S. WOULD
 NOT DISPUTE THE ALLEGATIONS THAT
 THE SAUDI CROWN PRINCE WAS
 WORKING ON THE MURDER OF JAMAL
 KHAISHOGGI.
 HE CALLED FOR SCANNING ABILITY
 AT ALL POINTS OF ENTRY.
 FOR THE FUTURE, HE SAID
 MR. TRUMP IS BUILD■@ FABULOUS
 CAMPAIGN AND A NUMBER OF NEW
 RESOURCES.
