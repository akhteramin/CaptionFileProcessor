 VEILED TODAY
 SCOTT, BACK TO YOU
 > THANKS SO MUCH
 APPLE SHARES CLOSING DOWN MORE
 THAN 1%.
 STILL UP AROUND 20% THIS YEAR,
 SO WILL THE COMPANY'S
 TRSFORMATION TO SERVICES PAY
 OFF FOR INVESTORS?
 THAT'S THE KEY QUESTION.
 THAT'S WHAT IT IS ABOUT.
 IT IS
 THE STOCK IS UP 33% FROM JANUARY
 2nd WHEN THE COMPANY
 PREANNOUNCED PRETTY
 DISAPPOINTING SCAL QUARTER
 A LOT HAD TO DO WITH HARDWARE
 AND WEAKNESS IN CHINA.
 IF YOU CAN OVERLOOK ALL THAT AND
 LOOK AT THE ANNOUNCEMENTS THEY
 MADE TODAY WHILE THERE WASN'T A
 WHOLE HECK OF A LOT OF DETAIL,
 PRICG, THAT SORT OF THING,
 WHEN THE PRODUCTS ARE GOING TO
 BE RELEASED CAN YOU THINK ABOUT
 THAT INSTALL BASE AND THE FACT
 THAT THE AVERAGE iPHONE USER
 SPENDS $44 ON -YOU KNOW,
 ANNUALLY ON THEIR -THROUGH
 THEIR DEVICE IN THIS ECOSYSTEM
 AND THAT'S A WHOLE HOST OF
 SERVICES THAT THEY'LL BE ABLE TO
 EXPAND THAT ECOSYSTEM.
 IT'S NOT A REASON TO BUY AT 188
 BUCKS UP 33% FROM THOSE 52-WEEK
 LOWS BUT SOMETHING THAT SHOULD
 GIVE YOU SOLACE ABOUT THE FUTURE
 OF THE COMPANY AS THEY TRY TO
 FIGURE OUT HOW TO OFFSET UNIT
 DECLINES AND WHAT WILL
 ULTIMATELY DECLINING MARGINS IN
 THE HARDWARE BUSINESS.
 TIMMY, DAN SAID IT.
 NOT ENOUGH TO BUY THE STOCK.
 IS THAT RIGHT?
 AT 14 1/2 X TIMES CASH PUTS
 YOU AROUND 220, 225.
 I OWN THE STOCK.
 I THINK IT'S WORTH OWNING
 INDEPENDENT OF TODAY'S
 ANNOUNCEMENT
 I THINK I AGREE WITH DAN.
 DO YOU BUY  FRE HERE?
 YEAH, I CAN PUT FRESH CAPITAL
 WORK HERE.
 NOTHING BLUE YOU OUT OF THE
 WATER.
 THE SELL-OFF IS ABSURD
 IF THAT'S WHY IT SOLD OFF, IT
 FAILED AT 200.
 MOVING DOWN INTO THE EVENT
 ANYWAY.
 THAT'S THE --
 I MEAN TODAY, I MEAN.
 THE GO TO ACTION.
 YOU SELL IT BASICALLY ON THE
 EVENT AND CHECK THE BOX AND DID
 ENOUGH TO MAKE IT INTERESTING.
 BUT IT'S NOT KILLING NETFLIX
 PRICE ACTION SHOWS THAT.
 IT'S HELPING ROKU.
 PRICE ACTION SHOWS THAT.
 I THINK THEY DID ENOUGH WITH
 LEAVING --
  SORRY
 WHAT DO YOU MEAN
 PRICE ACTION IN ROKU.
 BENEFITS THEM, TAILWIND.
 PRICE ACTION IN NETFLIX, NOT A
 NETFLIX KILLER BUT APPLE IS NOT
 A --
 IT WILL BE INCLUDED SO APPLE
 WILL BE INCLUDED ON ROKU'S
 PLATFORM.
 GUY, ATO YOU THINK,
 CREDIT CARD, THE TV, THE CREDIT
 CARD --
 WELCOME
 IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE.
 YOU'RE ALWAYS WELCOMING
 WELCOME BACK.
 LET'S GET THOSE PLEASANTRIES OUT
 OF THE WAY.
 IT'S NICE.
 LISTEN --
 BACK TO THE MATTER AT HAND.
 IT WAS A PRETTY INTERESTING
 ANNOUNCEME GTING AWAY FROM
 THE HARDWARE SIDE AND THINK IT'S
 INTERESTING.
 CREDIT CARD, PEOPLE WILL SAY,
 NOA BIG DEAL
 FOR A LOT OF MILLENNIALS IT
 MIGHT BE
 THEY'RE WORKING ON THAT INSTALL
 BASE WITHOUT QUESTION.
 IN TERMS OF THE STOCK, THOUGH,
 ALL-TIME HIGH 232 OR SO IN
 SEPTEMBER.
 TRADED DOWN TO 1 -WHAT WAS IT
 142-ISH ON DECEMBER 24th
 IF YOU LOOK AT THE 50%
 RETRACEMENT PUTS YOU EXACTLY
 WHERE IT'S TRADING RIGHT NOW
 I HAPPEN TO WATCH THE "SQUAWK
 BOX" WITH JOE KERNEN
 HE INTERVIEWED JIM CRAMER.
 NOT THAT I'M TRYING TO CURRY
 FAVOR WITH JIM, JIM WAS DISMAYED
 IT WAS HIGHER IN THE PREMARKET
 SAYING IT WAS PERFECT TO SEL
 OFF.
 HE WAS RIGHT
 I THINK IT BACKS OFFER
 NOT TO SPAS ASPERSIONS AT APPLE.
 I JUSTY IT'S RUN TOO FAR TO
 I THOUGHT THAT WAS AN
 INTERESTING THING.
 SERVICE GROWTH IN THE QUARTER
 WAS IN THE TEENS, YOU KNOW, IT'S
 DECELERATED OFF OF WHAT WAS A
 VERY SMALL BASE.
 HIGHER GROWTH RATES AND 50% --
 NOW THAT IT'S BECOME A $20
 LLION ANNUAL BUSINESS AND
 GROWING, IT'S MUCH LESS SO TO ME
 I THINK THAT POINTING TO
 SERVICES GROWTH IS NOT THE WHOLE
 THING, YOU HAVE TO POINT TO THE
 HIGHER MARGINS BUT YOU HAD A
 GREAT DISCUSSION, THE HALFTIME
 REPORT ON AT NOON EVERY DAY.
 PROFESSIONAL.
 BUT TONY SAID HE EXPECTS
 UNITS TO BE DOWN 15% YEAR OVER
 YEAR
 THIS IS THE THIRD CONSECUTIVE
 YEAR
 THAT'S REALLY --
 YOU'LL NEED GREATER GROWTH
 AND REALLY FAT MARGINS
 THEY'RE SPLITTING --
 IS IT ENOUGH?
 IT AT LEAST GIVES YOU THE
 CONVERSATION --
 IT AT LEAST GIVES YOU THE
 CONVERSATION AND GETS YOUR MIND
 OFF THE HARDWARE BUSINESS THAT
 IS SLUGGISH AND SLOWING AND
 THINK ABOUT THE $40 BILLION
 NUMBER
 THEY SPENT TWO HOURS SPEAKING
 TO THE ENTIRE WORLD ABOUT THIS
 HUGE NEW OPPORTUNITY
 WOULDN'T YOU LE WALL STREET
 ANALYSTS TO COME OUT AND SAY
 THIS IS GOING TO BE AN X AMOUNT
 OF OPPORTUNITY
 YEAH.
 WE'LL --
 THEY'RE NOT DOING THAT.
 IF YOU THINK OF FIRST OF ALL
 THE CREDIT CARD BUSINE, I
 ACTUALLY THINK THAT IS SOMETHING
 THAT ULTIMATELY COULD MOVE THE
 NEEDLE
 THE SERVICES BUSINESS, SORRY,
 THE APPLE PLUS, THE TV PLUS AND
 WHATEVER IS IN THAT BUNDLE AND
 REALIZE THEY HAVE A FEW
 HIGH-PROFILE CONTENT CREATOR ON
 THEIR PLATFORM RIGHT NOW, LOOK,
 IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME.
 THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD
 HAVE TOLD THAWS WOULD HAVE
 ANGED THE STORY.
 THIS IS ABOUT A COMPANY
 ALLOCATING RESOURCES TOWARD HIGH
 MARGIN BUSINESSES AND AT THIS
 POINT AND VALUATION WHY
 SHOULDN'T WE BELIEVE APP
 "JOURNAL" THEY'VE DELIVERED ON
 EVERYTHING THEY WENT TO DO WITH
 AN INCREDIBLY LOYAL CUSTOMER
 BASE WHO -THOSE GUYS PROBABLY
 WANT --
  FOR YEARS APPLE TV WAS
 RELEASED EIGHT YEARS AGO OR
 SOMETHING AND STEVE JOBS CALLED
 IT A HOBBY
 IT'S ALWAYS BEEN CATEGORIZED
 THAT WAY
 ROKU HAD A BIG DAY
 EVERYTHING HAD A BIG DAY --
 IT'S A VERY CONFUSING.
 DOESN'T HAVE TO BE, DOES IT
 THIS IS THE FIRST OFFERING
 THIS COMPANY HAS EVER PUT OUT IN
 E SOFTWARE UNIVERSE AT YOU
 CAN GET WITHOUT THEIR HARDWARE
 THERE'S SOME THINGS ON ANDROID
 NOW.
 ES ON THE ANDROID DEVICE
 THAT IS A MASSIVE SHIFT FOR THE
 COMPANY OVER THE 40-YEAR --
 THEY HAVE TO.
 I KNOW SO THE QUESTION IS,
 THERE'S SO LITTLE DETAIL BIT
 WHO KNOWS.
 THIS MAY NOT B-THE VIDEO
 STREAMING BUSINESS MAY NOT --
 IT WASN'T ENOUGH -I'LL
 SPEAK -IT WASN'T ENOUGH FOR ME
 TO SAY I'M ON BOARD.
 FIRST OF ALL WE DON'T KNOW
 PRICING OR WHAT THE OFFERING
 WILL BE.
 I DON'T THINK THERE'S ENOUGH
 THERE BUT I DO OWN THE STOCK
 I OWN IT FROM LOWER AND IF I OWN
 TODAY. IS, IN EFFECT, BUYING IT
 PUTTING NEW MONEY TO WORK
 BECAUSE YOU'RE STILL STAYING
 LONG SO I THINK THEY DID ENOUGH
 TO PREOCCUPYPLE UNTIL WE GET
 ALL THE DETAILS.
 DOES IT GET YOU EXCITED ABOUT
 WHAT THEY'RE DOING FROM THE
 SERVICES STANDPOINT TO, AGAIN,
 GROW THAT BUSINESS TO ENOUGH
 SCALE TO OFFSET ANY SLOWDOWN IN
 PHONES
 LOOK.
 AND HARDWARE.
 DAN TALKED ABOUT HOW IT'S A
 SMALL BASE SO THE EARLY GROWTH
 NUMBERS OF THE DELTA WAS MORE
 IMPRESSIVE A YEAR AND A HALF AGO
 BUT IT'S STILL AN ABSOLUTE IN
 TERMS OF AGGREGATE TERMS
 MASSIVE.
 I AM EXCITED ABOUT THE LOYALTY
 AND ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE WAYS
 THEY'RE MONETIZING
 PEOPLE ARE COMMITTED TO APPLE
 AND THEY'RE STUCK IF THEY'RE ON
 TV AND I CAN PICK UP A KNICKS
 GAME, $2.99 WON'T MEAN A LOT
 A LOT BEHAVE THAT WAY WITH
 APPLE.
 THEY'RE NOT SAYING IT,
 THEY'RE FOCUSING ON SERVICES AND
 IT'S BECAUSE THEY SEE THE
 DECELERATION IN HARDWARE
 THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SAY THAT
 BUT THEIR LASER FOCUS --
 THEIR ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER
 THAN WORDS.
 JINKS.
 THE QUESTION, IS THE
 SERVICE'S BUSINESS, ARE REVENUES
 SLOWING TO THE POINT WHERE TIGHT
 GO
  -IT'S GOING TO BE A
 HINDRANCE?
 YOU CAN'T HAVE SERVICE REVENUE
 SLOWING AT THE SAME TIME THAT
 HANDSET SALES ARE SLOWING?
 IN ORDER TO GET THE VALUATION
 THEY WANT THE PEOPLE ALONG THE
 STOCK WATCH SERVICES REVENUE HAS
 TO BE AROUND 20% TO 22%.
 WHAT, ARE WE ABOUT 15%, 16%?
 AND THAT IS GETTING SLOWER
 TOWARDS THE UPSIDE
 ONE POINT, IT'S REALLY
 IMPORTANT.
 YOU DON'T TEED TO HAVE HYPER
 GROWTH
 CAN YOU HAVE MIDTEENS GROWTH ON
 A BUSINESS THAT'S, YOU KNOW,
 THAT HAS MUCH HIGHER MARGINS
 THAN THE HARDWARE BUSINESS
 GREAT FOR THE OVERALL PIE.
 THIS DOESN'T NEED TO BE A HYPER
 GROWTH STORY BUT TAKING SOME OF
 THE TOTAL ADDRESSABLE MARKET
 THAT EXISTS AND GROWING IT ON
 YOUR USER BASE THAT MAY NOT BE
 USINOF SERVICES OF OTHER
 PROVIDERS.
 THE NEGATIVE WAY TO SPIN IT
 FROM A PERSON LONG HOW MUCH ISTL
 ABOUT TRYING TO STEM OR STOP THE
 SLIDE IN HARDWARE SALES?
 THEY'RE PUTTING AN AWFUL LOT OF
 TIME INTO SERVICES
 MAYBE THEY JUST CAN'T HANDLE THE
 SLIDE -THERE'S NOTHING TO DO
 ABOUT THE HARDWARE SIDE WHICH
 THEN BECOMES AN OVERWHELMING --
 YOU HAVE TO TARGET YOUR
 INSTALLED BASE, 1.BILLION
 DEVICES IN THE UNIVERSE OUT
 THERE.
 I KNOW.
 I'M THE INSTALL BASE TOO AND I
 WASN'T OVERWHELMED BY THIS
 THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE
 SOMETHING THAT -AT LEAST ALT
 THIS POINT.
 TIM WILL PLAY 3 BUCKS FOR A
 KNICK GAME
 THEY'RE WORTH A BUCK.
 I WILL PAY 3 BUT THAT'S WHAT
 PEOPLE DO ON THEIR iPHONES AND
 THEY HAVE A CAPTIVE AUDIENCE
 1.4 INSTALLED BASE
 THE ULTIMATE IS PROBABLY 20
 TIMES AS OPPOSED TO ABOUT 11
 TIMES ON THE HARDWARE AND
 SOMETHING PEOPLE FORGET ON A $4
 BILLION -IF.
 YOU MENTIONED JAMIE DIMON
 DIDN' -
 CRAMER DIDN'T LIKE THE STOCK UP.
 IT HAS RUN --
 THIS STOCK USUALLY RUN HAS AN
 EVENT AN SELLS OFFER
 S
 SAKINOCCI SAID ON THE SHOW --
 THE MARKETPLACE TOLD YOU THE
 VALUATION AND WEREN'T IMPRESSED
 AND SOLD THE STOCK OFF AND ALL
 RE RIVERALS WERE BOUGHT.
 UP 10% IN A MONTH.
 IT LAGGED THE MARKET TOO,
 SCOTT.
 THERE'S SOME PART THATENMENT
 GOT SO PR AND PEOPLE WERE
 LOOKING AT VALUATIONS AND APPLE
 UNDERPERFORMED
 MORE, CUPERTINO, GENE, YOU
 WERE IN THE EVENT, I BELIEVE,
 TODAY.
 WHAT'S YOUR TAKEAWAY TONIGHT
 SCOTT, REALLY TWO IMPACT.
 IF YOU PUT THESE FOUR SERVICES
 TOGETHER AND THINK ABOUT WHAT IT
 COULD ADD IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS
 I THINK ABOUT A BILLION OR 20
 BILLION OR SO IN REVENUE, THAT
 PROBABLY EQUATES TO ABOUT 10% IN
 "S
 ANNUAL SERVICES GROWTHTHAT'SHE .
 THEN I THINK THERE'S A HIGHER
 LEVEL ORDER THAT APPLE IS
 SHOOTING FOR THAT GETS LIN
 THESE ANNOUNCEMENTS.
 THEY'VE BEEN LARGELY ANTICIPATED
 AND WHETHER OR NOT THE CONSUMERS
 WANT THIS REMAINS TO BE SEEN BUT
 EFFECTIVELY WHAT APPLE IS
 SAYING, THEY'LL TAKE THINGS WE
 INTERACT WITH EVERY DAY WHETHER
 A SCREAMING SER-STREAMING SERE
 OR CREDIT CARD AND IT'S
 ENRICHING PEOPLE'S LIVES AND I
 RECOGNIZE WHEN I USE THAT
 LANGUAGE IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE
 I'M JUST REPEATING WHAT THEIR
 MESSAGE BUT I THINK IT IS AN
 IMPORTANT DISTINCTION TRYING TO
 CREATE CONTENT NOT ABOUT THE
 TYPICACONTL T WE'VE SEEN, THIS
 ENRICHED CONTENT, GAMING MORE
 HEALTHY GAMING AND FIRST TIME A
 CREDIT CARD CAN ACTUALLY ADD
 TRANSPARENCY AND THAT GETS LOST
  THE CONVERSATION TODAY.
 THESE SUBTLE LITTLE APPROACHES
 THAT APPLE DOES TO MAKE OUR
 LIVES JUST A LITTLE BIT BETTER
 AND I THINK THAT ULTIMATELY WILL
 YIELD A HIGHER SHARE PRICE
 I'M ENCOURAGED BY THE
 ANNOUNCEMENT.
 IT TAKES THE SERVICES
 BUSINESS TO THE NEXT LEVEL, SO
 TO SPEAK
 YEAH, DEFINITELY ONHE VIDEO
 SIDE, ON THE CREDIT CARD
 WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS SOMETHING
 THAT I THINK OTHER CREDIT CARDC
 TRY TO ADD THAT LAYER OF
 TRANSPARENCY
 REALLY SHIFTING THE FOCUS FROM
 MAKING MONEY AS AN ISSUER TO TRY
 TO -APPLE IS NOT GOING TO MAKE
 A TON OF MONEY OFF THE CDIT
 CARD
 I WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT.
 THIS IN FIVE YEARS CAN BE CALL
 IT A BILLION AND A HALF DOLLAR
 BUSINESS, MUCH SMALLER THAN THE
 $15 BILLION BUT THE INTERESTING
 PART JUST TO GO ONE MORE LEVEL
 DEEPER ON THE CREDIT CARD, THE
 EXCITING PART, IF YOU LOOK AT
 THE OTHER ANNOUNCEMENTS THERE
 ARE VARIATIONS TO A BETTER
 DEGREE THAWE'VE SEEN BEFORE
 BUT THE CREDIT CARD, THAT
 ACTUALLY WAS A MAMEASURABLE
 I THINK THAT IS A GOOD EXAMPLE
 OF WHAT AN ADVANTAGE THAT APPLE
 HAS OF TYING TOGETHER THE
 HARDWARE, SOFT AND SERVICES.
 GENE, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE
 INVESTMENT THEY'RE PUTTING IN
 AND TRYING TO BECOME A
 COMPETITOR OF NETFLIX, WERE YOU
 UNDERWHELMED BY THE AMOUNT OF
 INVESTMENTS, SHOULD THAT BE 10X
 OR THE FACT TO YOUR POINT IT'S
 FOUR SERVICES SO THEY'RE TRYING
 TO FOCUS ON ALL OF THEM AND NOT
 JUST ONE OF THEM AND THEN MORE
 OF AN AGGREGATOR VERSUS A DIRECT
 COMPETITOR TO SO MANY SERVICES
 THEY'RE OFFERING
 I THINK THEY WANTED TO TRY TO
 BUNDLE ALL THESE SERVICE
 ANNOUNCEMENTS TOGETHER
 A LOGICAL TIME OF THE YEAR TO DO
 THAT
 WHEN YOU DO THAT, YOU HAVE TO
 PREANNOUNCE THINGS AND DON'T
 HAVE A LOT OF DETAIL SO LET'S
 TALK ABOUT THE VIDEO REAL
 QUICKLY.
 IT'S UNCLEAR HOW MANY SHOWS AND
 MOVIES THEY HAVE
 MOST LIKELY PROBABLY AROUND 40
 WHICH IS A FAR CRY FROM NETFLIX
 AT A THOUSAND ORIGINAL SERIES.
 BUT I THINK THE QUALITY OF THIS
 IS WHAT IS GOING TO ULTIMATELY
 STAND OUT AND I SUSPECT THE WAY
 APPLE WILL MEASURE THEIR SUCCESS
 IS THE NUMBER OF INDTRY
 AWARDS
 I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT
 ENTERTAINMENT AND THE AWARDS
 THEY'LL GUN FOR BUT AT THE
 OF THE DAY THIS CONTENT, THIS
 DIFFERENT APPROACH IS GOING TO
 HAVE AN IMPACT AND THINK THAT
 COULD BE A SIMILAR SIZE BUSINESS
 AS NETFLIX CALLS IT, $15 BILLION
 A YEAR
 I AM IN THE CAMP IT WILL HAVE A
 NEGATIVE IMPACT OVER THE NEXT
 YEAR.
 HOW DO YOU JUDGE THE STOCK
 TODAY GIVEN THE FACT IT HAD SUCH
 A BIG RUN INTO THE
 ANNOUNCEMENTS?
 I THINK IT'S A GREAT EXAMPLE
 OF HOW THESE APPLE EVENTS SET
 UP
 WE GENERALLY KNOW WHAT'S
 HAPPENING GOING INTO IT BUT THE
 SIGNIFICANCE OF WHAT'S ANNOUNCED
 REALLY DOESN'T BECOME MORE CLEAR
 TO US UNTIL QUARTERS AND YEARS
 AHEAAND I THINK I JUDGE THE
 SIGNIFICANCE AS APPLE IS MAKING
 A STATEMENT AND GOING AFTER
 SERVICES BUT THEY'RE ALSO TAKING
 A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO SERVICE.
 THAT DIFFERENT APPROACH IS
 ENRICHING LIVES AND MORE HEALTHY
 GAME CONTENT
 SO I VIEW THIS AS A POSITIVE IN
 LINE WITH APPLE'S BRAND AND
 MENTIONED SECURITY IF YOU'RE
 INTERESTED AND PLAYING BUZZWORD
 BINGO SEVEN TIMES THEY ARE HEAVY
 ON THAT THEME AS WELL WHICH I
 THINK IS SOMETHING UNIQUE APPLE
 CAN ADD TO THESE SERVICE.
 THIS MUST TAKE A DEAL FOR A
 CONTENT COMPANY OFF THE TABLE.
 WHAT WOULD -WHAT WOD IT
 TAKE TO -I MISSED THAT.
 I'M SAYING THESE KIND OF
 ANNOUNCEMENTS WOULD TAKE A DEAL
 FOR ANY KIND OF CONTENT COMPANY
 BY APPLE OFF THE TABLE
 I THINK LARGELY YOU'RE RIGHT
 BECAUSE I THINK WHAT IT SHOWS
 THEY WANT TO DO SOMETHING
 DIFFERENT.
 DO IT THEMSELVES.
 I DON'T THINK THEY'LL ACQUIRE
 NET FLISHGS.
 CBS, THEY'LL ACQUIRE SOME TYPE
 OF CONTENT
 THEY WOULD HAVE TO KILL A LOT OF
 THE CONTENT SO I THINK IT
 LARGELY DOES TAKE THAT OFF THE
 TABLE.
 GENE, THANKS.
 GOOD TO TALK TO YOU AS ALWAYS.
 GUY.
 BEGIN, GENE, HE NAILS IT.
 50% RETRACEMENT OFF THE ALL-TIME
 HIGH
 THE 50 DAY MOVING AGE COMING
 IN AROUND 175.
 I THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO THINK
 BEFORE EARNINGS ON APRIL 30th
 APPLE RETESTS THAT 175 LEVEL.
 I THINK THEY MISS THE MARKET
 AS FAR AS VIDEO CONTENT.
 THAT'S NOT WHY PEOPLE HAVE KNELT
 APPLICATION AND NETFLIX AND
 CHILL.
 NETFLIX'S ORIGINAL CONTENT IS
 LESS THAN 8% OF THEIR VIEWABLE
 HOURS.
 APPLE IS SO FAR AWAY
 OPRAH TV ON APPLE TV WON'T BE
 THE REASON WHY THE ECOSYSTEM
 USES THEIR SERVICE SO THIS IS
 GOING TO BE A DUD FOR A BID.
 BANK STOCKS GETTING CRUSHED.
 GET A LOT WORSE FOR ONE KEY ULD
 GROUP.
 HE'LL BE HERE TO TELL YOU WHICH
 ONE.
 PLUS, TESLA IS SINKING AFTER RBC
 SLASHES ITS PRICE TARGET ON THE
 ELECTRIC CARMAKER.
 THE STOCK JUST DID SOMETHING
 THAT COULD SIGNAL A U-TURN AHEAD
 AND LATER GUY IS STEPPING UP TO
 THE PLATE WITH ONE STOCK HE SAYS
