- What an adorable bundle of energy you are. Tell me about yourself. 
- Oh, my gosh. Okay, my name's Missy Silverman. 
- Right. 
- I'm from Philadelphia. 
- Okay. 
- And I teach-
- [cheers and applause] Philly! 
- Phillies fans? 
- They are. 
- I teach preschool fitness to little kids. 
- Preschool fitness, wow. 
- Yes. 
- Jumping jacks, jogging. 
- Wow. 
- Cha-cha. 
- Cha-cha, because preschoolers don't move enough. You get them moving more. 
- I do. Yes, it's so much fun. 
- That's wonderful. Tell me about your personal life. 
- Okay, so I have two amazing teenagers. 
- Right. 
- And I am married 23 years. 
- Congratulations. You look too young for that. 
- Oh, I feel young. 
- And if you should win $1 million, what are the kind of things you'd want to do? 
- I've been a mom for 19 years, and I take care of my parents, and I work full time, so if I win the money, I need a girl vacation. A girl vacation! 
- So you've been giving and being for others. 
- Oh, Howie, yes. 
- So tonight is all about you and getting stuff that's for you. I get it. So with a million dollars, the things with a million dollars, you said a girl trip. 
- Yes. 
- Anything else? 
- Oh, well, college for my kids. 
- College, so it's for the family and for the future and for trips. 
- Yes. 
- Are you ready to play? 
- I'm ready, I'm ready! 
- Okay, let's go! 
- Oh, hi! Okay. 
- All right. There are 26 lovely ladies holding 26 different cases, and in each of those cases is a different amount of money, randomly packed by a third party, so we don't know what's in any case. We do know that the largest amount of money is $1 million all the way down to a penny. You just have to pick a case. Are you a lucky person? 
- I'm so lucky. I enter every contest imaginable, and I win concert tickets and ice cream for my entire business, my family business. 
- What business are you in? 
- Oh, my husband and I have a hand car wash. 
- Okay, and is that business doing well? 
- Yes, yes. 
- Okay, good. I want to tell you something. Our producers knew--I guess they had spoken to you-
- that you wanted to travel. Well, one of these cases has a very special prize inside, and if you open it before you take the deal, the prize is gonna be yours. Are you feeling lucky? 
- Yes! Oh, my gosh! 
- Which case do you want? 
- Okay, I want case number 17! 
- 17, that's Ashley. [cheers and applause] <i> [Music] [Music]</i> Thanks, Ashley. 
- Hi, thank you. You're gorgeous. Yay! Mwah. Hi. 
- You feeling it? 
- Yes. 
- All right, so let's find out if 17's got a million in it. You know how we do it? 
- Yes. 
- By opening those. Whatever's in those is not in yours. Let's start by opening up six cases. 
- Okay. Number 24! 
- Kizzi. 
- Low, low, low, low, low. 
- Kizzi, open your case. 
- Yes! 
- Good. 
- Yes! Yes! Come on! Yes! 
- Yes. 
- Low. 
- Five more. 
- That's Sarati. Sarati, open the case. 
- Yes, yes! Oh, my God, I'm so happy. 
- You're making everybody happy. Four more cases. 
- Oh, gosh. Okay. 
- Number 14 is Olga. 
- Olga, open your case. 
- Oh. [crowd groans] 
- It's a little bit of a hit. $750,000 is off the plate. That means that this case... 
- The million's in there! 
- Doesn't have $750,000. It means it could still have $1 million. 
- Okay. Okay. 
- Three more cases. 
- Six, six, six! 
- Six. Megan, open your case. 
- Okay, okay. 
- That's good. That's good. 
- Okay. 
- Got to find that special prize. 
- I'm looking! 
- I know. 
- Okay, number 19! 
- That's Natasha. Natasha, open your case. [all groaning] 
- Howie. 
- Okay, but there's still a lot of big amounts up there. One more case. 
- Number three. 
- That's Katie. 
- Low, low, low. 
- Katie is the last one in this round. It would be nice to close the round with a prize. That would be nice. 
- Please. That would be nice. 
- Open the case. 
- Girls' trip, girls' trip. 
- Oh, please. Yes, yes, yes! That's good. 
- That's good. 
- That's good. Thank you. 
- You still have huge money on the board. You still got the big amounts there. We want you to go home with prizes. We want you to go home with money. We want you to have the time that you now deserve for yourself. Everybody wants that. 
- Please, for sure. Yes. 
- Except one person. That lady up there. That lady wants you to go home with as little as possible. She wants to buy your case and send you out of here now. 
- I forgot about her. 
- You forgot about her? 
- Banker, shmanker. 
- All right. 
- Be nice. [crowd jeering] Be nice, be nice. 
- She said she will not be nice. She's not here to be nice. She's here to be shrewd. She's a business person, so she is only going to do whatever it takes to get you to leave here for as little as possible. 
- I am not leaving. [applause] 
- Well, she's gonna make you an offer to buy this case right now. 
- Okay. 
- All right, your first offer is $19,000. Listen to me. She will give you that right now, take that case, and you're on your way. There is also a little twist in Deal or No Deal 2.0, where you have the opportunity for one counteroffer in the game. You can counter. If she accepts it, she gets the case, you get the money, and you go home. If she says no deal, you play on. In this case, playing on is opening up another five cases, and remember, there's also a prize in there. You say you're lucky. 
- I am. 
- She said, If she's so lucky, let's see if she can find the prize. So I'm gonna ask you, Missy Silverman, deal or no deal? [crowd shouting] 
- No! 
- No! 
- I don't like the banker. No deal! No deal! I don't like her. 
- You know those little toys that you wind up? That's what you remind me of. 
- I know, that's funny. Okay. 
- Thank you. 
- Anne Julia, open your case. 
- Low. Low, low, low, low. Yes! [cheering] I'm so happy. 
- We have four more cases to open, and we'll open those four when we come back. <i> [Music] [Music]</i> 
- [whistles] Wake up, banker! 
- Whoa, whoa! <i> announcer: The battle</i> <i> has only just begun.</i> 
- She does not like spunky. 
- She needs to lighten up. <i> announcer: And only one</i> <i> of these women</i> <i> will go home happy.</i> 
- She's not looking thrilled. 
- I want more money, and I don't like the banker, and I feel lucky. [cheers and applause] 
- Whoa! 
- Whoo! <i> Every day,</i> <i> visionaries are creating</i> <i> the future.</i> <i> So, every day,</i> <i> we put our latest technology</i> <i> and unrivaled network to work.</i> <i> The United States</i> <i> Postal Service makes</i> <i> more e-commerce</i> <i> deliveries to homes</i> <i> than anyone else</i> <i> in the country.</i> <i> Because the future only</i> <i> happens with people</i> <i> who really know how</i> <i> to deliver it.</i> <i> Let's see, ALEVE is</i> <i> proven better on pain</i> <i> Because the future only</i> <i> happens with people</i> <i> than Tylenol Extra Strength.</i> <i> And last longer</i> <i> with fewer pills.</i> So why am I still thinking about this? I'll take Aleve. <i> ALEVE.</i> <i> Proven better on pain.</i> AI unlocks the art of science. When you open a bottle of beer, I don't think many people actually know the level of science that's filled into that bottle. Back in time, it took Carlsberg several years to produce a new beer. But using Microsoft Artificial Intelligence, we will be able to detect new flavors in a split second and develop better beers faster. With AI, we redefine what's possible. So cheers! <i> [dramatic music]</i> [cheers and applause] 
- All right, welcome back to Deal or No Deal. This is Missy Silverman. She's dreaming of a getaway trip for her and her friends. She's a mom. She's a wife. She's a teacher. She's a business owner. You got a lot going on. 
- Oh, my gosh, I do. 
- And you say you're very, very lucky. 
- I am. 
- Right, you win every contest. 
- I try, yes. 
- Okay. If you're just joining us, there is a prize, an added prize in one of the cases, and you're supposed to be the lucky one, so find the prize, Missy. 
- Okay. Oh, my. 
- Four cases to open. 
- Let me see. I hate picking them, because then the girls have to go, and they're so pretty. Okay. 
- You want to feel good about it? When they go, they get to take their shoes off. 
- Ah! Okay, okay. [laughter] All right, girls, 22! 
- Anchal. 
- Low, low, low, low, low, low. 
- Open the case. 
- Yes, yes, yes, oh, my gosh! Thank you, 22. 
- It's like a really pretty energizer bunny. Okay, three more cases. 
- Okay, four! Four! 
- That's Brenda. 
- Oh, low, low, low, low, low. 
- Or prize, a prize. 
- Or a vacation. 
- Open the case. [all groaning] 
- Not good. 
- It's all right. 
- The million dollars is off the board, but look at this. There is a block on the board-
- that bottom right goes $300,000, $400,000, and $1/2 million. That's huge. 
- That's a lot of money, yes. 
- You would get everything that you wanted with any of those amounts of money, right? 
- It would be a dream come true. 
- So all your dreams are still on that board. That's a huge amount of money. Keep that block together, and we're going places. Two more cases. 
- Number five! Five! 
- That's Lani. Open the case. 
- Low, low. Oh, low. 
- Oh, no. 
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! 
- She fooled you. Oh, my. 
- One more case. 
- Okay, number ten! 
- Number ten is Vaeda. Open your case. 
- Please, please, please, please. Yay! Yay, yay, yay! 
- Whoa! 
- Whoo! 
- Was that a cartwheel? 
- That was a cartwheel. 
- Wow! 
- I'm so excited I'm doing cartwheels. 
- Oh, my. Wow. You got a penny and stuck the landing. I think that's wonderful. All right, here's your arch nemesis. [crowd jeering] 
- Oh, no. 
- She says one word comes to mind when she looks at you, and that is spunky. [laughter] 
- Spunky, baby. [applause] 
- Oh, oh. She's saying she does not like spunky. [crowd murmuring] 
- Well, she needs to lighten up. [laughter] 
- Okay. You knocked out the million, so she's dropping this offer to $10,000. Listen to me. $10,000 is a lot of money. You've been here for a couple of minutes, you know, boom, $10,000. Nobody gets that kind of money. You also have an opportunity to counter-offer. If it's a reasonable counteroffer, she may take it, you sell your case, and you go home, or you can continue on and open up another four cases. These are big decisions, but you brought people you know with you. Let's meet your supporters. 
- Okay. 
- Hi. 
- Hi. 
- Who are you? 
- I'm Jill. I've been best friends with Missy my entire life. We went to elementary school together. We went to middle school together, high school, college, we got married. Not together, but... [laughs] 
- She's my best friend. 
- She was the first person there when my water broke when I was having a baby, and she is lucky, and she is gonna win. 
- Wow. You are? 
- Renee. 
- Hi, Renee. 
- Hi. Missy and I have been friends forever as well. I love her energy. She is a caregiver. Her father lost his sight, and she is there for him every day. There's no one more deserving than her family and her. 
- That's so nice. And you are? 
- Hi, I'm Jill also. I've been best friends with Marissa since I was five years old, and one thing Marissa didn't tell you, she is an only child. She has taken care of her parents her entire life. She is giving. She is kind. No one deserves this opportunity more than my best friend, no one. [cheers and applause] 
- I love them. 
- And they love you. Is this your family right here? 
- Yes. 
- Are you proud of your mom? 
- Yeah. 
- Yeah, extremely. 
- Yeah, they are. So everybody's proud of you. Everybody speaks highly of you, but they've got an important decision to make right now. Talk amongst yourselves. What do you want to do? 
- Okay. What should we do? 
- Look at the board. You're not ready to go. 
- Yeah, no. Some really big numbers. 
- We're gonna play the game. 
- No deal. 
- No deal, no deal. 
- It's still a lot of money, Howie. 
- It is a lot of money, but I'm gonna ask you the question. Missy Silverman, deal or no deal? 
- Oh, Howie. [crowd shouting] 
- Just play it. 
- Okay. No deal! No deal, no deal! 
- You got four cases to open. You could still find that special prize in there. Let's keep going. 
- 16 is Jessica Lee. 
- I hope it's low, low, low. 
- Jessica Lee, open your case. 
- Ooh. 
- Oh! 
- That was the worst case. 
- Oh, my Lord. 
- But you still got a block, $300,000 and $400,000. Either one of those is the dream, right? 
- Oh, yeah. 
- Okay. Three more cases. 
- Number one! Number one. 
- Soraya. Soraya, she's asking for a low amount or a vacation. 
- Low amount. She's not asking me to do a cartwheel, because I can't do that, but a low amount I could do. 
- No cartwheel. 
- She'll do a cartwheel if you have what she wants. 
- I will, I will. 
- I really would love that. Ready? 
- Yes. 
- Okay. Please low. 
- Vacation, low, low, low. Yeah! That's good. [cheers and applause] That's good! 
- Yeah! 
- I had to do it for you! Yes, thank you. 
- Two more. 
- That's good. All right, you're gorgeous, I hate to see you go, but number nine! Nine! 
- Patricia. 
- Low, low, low, low, low. 
- Patricia, open the case. 
- Low, low, low, low, low. 
- Okay, that's all right. 
- Ohh! 
- You kept the $300,000 and the $400,000 still in play. Don't break that block. You have one more case. 
- That's Malika. Malika. 
- 21, low, low, low, low. 
- Open the case. 
- Left side, left side. Yes! That's good! That's good. 
- Wow, that is fantastic. You realize there could be $300,000 in this case, or there could be $400,000 in this case, which means a big offer is coming your way when we come back. <i> [Music] [Music]</i> Can we know what the goal is? 
- Yeah, to get the $400,000. <i> announcer: Huge cash</i> <i> is still up for grabs...</i> 
- No deal, Howie. No deal! Oh, my God. <i> announcer: But that's not all</i> <i> Missy is looking for.</i>

- Welcome back to Deal or No Deal. This is Missy Silverman. You were about to get an offer. You've turned down a lot of money already. That was a good round. You've got a safety net there. You may have $300,000 or $400,000 in number 17 right there. She's not looking thrilled. 
- I forgot about her. 
- We're awaiting her call. 
- I forgot about her. [crowd murmuring] 
- Hello. Oh. 
- [exhales] 
- Okay, all right. That's surprising. 
- Oh, surprising good? 
- Yeah. 
- Oh. 
- Okay. Surprising good. I'll tell you why, because she was saying you think you're lucky. She thinks she's lucky. 
- I am, I feel lucky. 
- She's putting a little faith in your luck. 
- Oh, that's nice. 
- So the offer went up to $32,000. [cheers and applause] She said, I think she might be lucky, but is she the kind of person that will press her luck? 
- Oh. 
- You can walk out now with $32,000, you can counter-offer, or you can say no deal. If you said no deal or a counteroffer was not accepted, you have to open up three cases. Look at the board. There are two huge amounts and three cases to open, so how lucky are you? How strategic are you? Do you want to counter? 
- That's a lot of money, 
- Huge amount of money. 
- Years ago, we had a fire at our family car wash. Our business had burned down. 
- Aw. 
- To the ground. My gosh. And that money really can help, but there's still $400,000 on the board and $300,000 on the board, and I'm a fighter. I am a fighter. I think I might keep fighting. 
- Absolutely! Absolutely! 
- Keep going. 
- Your daughter's talking to you. What are you saying? 
- I think she should keep going. 
- You think she should keep going. You don't think she should counter, you don't think-
- 
- No, I don't--no. 
- Is your mom a fighter? Do you think she's a fighter? 
- Yeah. 
- A fighter and a winner. 
- A fighter and a winner, your husband said. 
- Keep going, keep going. 
- Keep going. 
- You have a goal, you have a goal. 
- She has a goal? 
- And it's not your business. 
- Oh, it's not my business. Oh, so you have an amount in mind? 
- No, no, no, no, not an amount, a goal. 
- I have a goal. We have a goal. 
- Can we know what the goal is? 
- Yeah, to get the $400,000. Yes! Yes! 
- Okay. 
- That's the goal. 
- Yes! 
- Missy Silverman, deal or no deal? [crowd shouting] 
- No way! 
- No. 
- No deal, Howie! No deal. 
- Wow. Stay away from those two cases. 
- Okay, number 26! 
- Michelle, open the case. 
- Low, low, please, please, please. 
- You got the prize, you got the prize! 
- [cheering] We're going away! We're going away! 
- By opening the case that's holding the Princess Cruises logo, you have won a cruise to one of Princess Cruises' 380 destinations that span over seven continents. They are known to be the best global premium cruise line. Missy, discover the world and relax at sea. Congratulations. You can go anywhere with the girls. You got the girls' trip. 
- We're going on a cruise! [cheers and applause] Oh, my gosh. I'm so happy! 
- Two more cases. 
- Okay, two. 
- Taylor. 
- A little amount. 
- Taylor, open your case. 
- Oh, please. 
- Small amount, left side. 
- Little, left side, left side. Yay! That's good. Oh, that's good. 
- That's great. 
- Thank you. 
- That's great, one more. 
- Thank you. 
- 15, that's Madi. Madi, open your case. 
- Oh, I can't look. I'm nervous. 
- So am I. 
- Low, low, low, low. Yes, yes, yes, yes! I'm freaking out. 
- That's a great board. 
- Oh, yay. 
- You think you're freaking out? I think she's freaking out. That's because the game is going great for you, not so great for her. 
- Hello? Hello? 
- [whistles] Wake up, banker! 
- Whoa, whoa. 
- Did she just do that? 
- That was--hang on. 
- Let's go, girl! 
- What was that? You scared me. You scared me. I didn't know what that-
- did that come out of you? [laughter] How do you do that? 
- Oh, boy. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. 
- Right. Okay. All right. Okay, there's eight cases left that have not been opened. Two of them have huge amounts, which means you have a 25% chance of walking out of here with at least $300,000. [cheers and applause] You do, if you continue to play on, have to open up two cases, so it's a little precarious, but you're in good shape. She understands that you're in good shape. She knows the board, and that's why this next offer-
- 
- Uh-huh. 
- Uh-huh. 
- In good shape. and you still have an opportunity to counteroffer. 
- No, no. 
- There's so much going on. 
- No. No, no, no, look at the board, okay? You had a goal. You're in a really good position, and that number is not high enough. 
- It's a high number, though. 
- Don't take it. 
- Honey? 
- I think you should keep going. 
- Okay. 
- Okay, well. 
- So I'm gonna ask you the question. Missy Silverman, deal or no deal? [crowd shouting] 
- Okay, Howie. No deal! 
- No deal. Two cases to go. 
- Oh, my gosh. 
- Two cases to go. Only two big amounts. A little precarious, but very exciting. We'll find out what she picks when you come back. <i> [Music] [Music]</i> 
- Hi! <i> announcer: There are only</i> <i> eight cases left.</i> 
- Look at her board. 
- Yeah. 
- Look at that board. 
- The question now is, will your luck hold on? <i> announcer:</i> <i> Has Missy gone too far?</i> 
- I'm scared. I'm scared. 
- I'm scared for you.

- Welcome back to Deal or No Deal. This is Missy Silverman. Before the break, you turned down $53,000. You've won your dream trip. 
- We've won our dream trip. 
- Look at that board. $300,000 and $400,000 are very good things. 
- Yes. 
- Even if you knock out one of those big amounts, the next offer's going down. 
- Oh. 
- Just stay away from those two big amounts. 
- Okay. 
- Two cases to open. 
- Case number 18! 
- I can't look. I can't look. 
- Elissa, open your case. 
- Oh, please, please. 
- Good. 
- That's okay. That's okay. 
- It's really good. 
- That's okay. 
- One more case. 
- Okay. 
- Amanza. This is a very important case. If you can stay away from the $300,000 and the $400,000, you're looking at a very big offer. 
- Okay, I'm hoping, Howie. 
- So, Amanza, just stay away from those two amounts. 
- Please, please. 
- You have the best energy. Just put some into this case and it's gonna work. 
- Oh, please, low, low, low... [all chanting] Low, low, low. 
- Open the case. 
- Low, low, low! 
- Please! 
- There you go. 
- I'm scared. [cheers and applause] 
- That is good! 
- That's good. 
- Not only is that great-
- if you decide to play on, it's only one case at a time. There are only six cases left. You have a one out of three chance of walking out of here with $300,000. You still have not used your counteroffer. [phone ringing] Hello? 
- You're doing great. 
- You are. 
- You're doing really, really great. 
- Okay. 
- Let's just hear it, and we'll talk. 
- She said you did what you had to do. 
- Yep, oh, yeah. 
- I don't know what that means, but yes, I did what I had to do. 
- So therefore, she has to do what she has to do. 
- Oh, boy. Okay. Oh, well... 
- How hard was it, when you think back, to turn down $53,000? 
- It was very, very hard to turn down $53,000. 
- It was very hard. 
- Yes. 
- So if that was hard, what are you gonna do... 
- Oh, no. 
- With $77,000? 
- Oh! 
- No. 
- Look at her board. 
- Yeah. 
- Look at that board. 
- That's a pretty board. 
- And now, she only does one at a time. 
- Right. 
- One at a time! 
- It's not even time for the counteroffer. 
- Mom, then you can do a counteroffer for the-
- 
- What do you say? 
- I'm saying she should wait to counter-offer until, like, if she knocks one of the bigger ones. 
- Yeah. 
- She still can lose one. She can still lose one of the $300,000 or the $400,000. 
- He doesn't always agree with her, so he agreed. 
- This is the first time they have agreed? 
- It might be. The force is with you. I'd keep going. 
- But you realize, if she knocks out and loses one of those amounts, either the $300,000 or the $400,000, there's no safety net. 
- Don't play it safe. 
- He's saying, your son just said, Don't play it safe. 
- I know, but it's a lot of money. 
- You came to play. 
- You know, you do a lot for everybody else. 
- I do. 
- The question is, what do you want to do for yourself, Missy Silverman? Deal or no deal? [crowd shouting] [all chanting] One more case! One more case! 
- No deal! One more case! Oh! Oh, my gosh, I'm scared, but I feel lucky. 
- Yes! 
- Oh, I'm scared. 
- One case. 
- Okay, one case. 
- Just keep your safety net employed. 
- Okay, 11! 
- Brittany. 
- I'm so scared. Oh, my gosh. 
- Brittany, do what you can, open the case. 
- Low, low. 
- I'm feeling the pressure. 
- Oh, please, low, low. Low, low, low, low, please. Oh, that's good! [cheers and applause] 
- Wow! Big offer coming your way when we come back. 
- Yes! <i> [Music] [Music]</i>

You didn't choose to have endometriosis... but you can choose to ask if ORILISSA is right for you. ORILISSA is specifically developed for women with moderate to severe endometriosis pain. In clinical trials, ORILISSA was proven to reduce 3 common types of endometriosis pain, painful periods, pelvic pain in between periods, and pain with sex. Don't use ORILISSA if you are or may be pregnant, have osteoporosis, severe liver disease, or are taking drugs like cyclosporine or gemfibrozil. It may cause abnormal liver tests. ORILISSA may change your periods, making it hard to know if you are pregnant. It does not prevent pregnancy. Use birth control that does not contain hormones. ORILISSA may cause suicidal thoughts or actions. It may also cause bone loss. Ask your gynecologist if ORILISSA is right for you. ORILISSA. Made for endo pain. One-millionth order. Millionth order.

- All right, welcome back to Deal or No Deal. Missy Silverman, mom, wife, business woman, won a dream vacation. You've got a big offer coming. You said, during the commercial break, what did you say to me? It doesn't feel real? 
- It does not feel real. 
- Oh, it is about to get real, young lady. [phone ringing] [crowd jeering] 
- Oh, the banker. 
- Hello. Okay. You said it was hard to turn down $53,000. 
- It was. 
- You said it was harder to turn down $77,000. 
- That's a lot of money. 
- It is a lot of money. 
- Oh, no. 
- There's a new offer. 
- What is it? I can't take it. 
- You have to make a decision... 
- Oh! 
- About $117,000 dollars. [cheers and applause] 
- Wow. 
- Oh, that's so much money. 
- It just got serious over there. 
- It's serious. 
- One case to open. No counteroffer. You have tears. Why do you have tears? Talk to me. 
- Because she deserves this. She is a beaming light, and she deserves everything. 
- Thank you. 
- You're welcome, honey. 
- Oh, honey, I love you. 
- I love you, honey. 
- Oh, my gosh. 
- So we discussed this. You still have your counteroffer. 
- Right. 
- You still have two really big numbers up there. 
- Yes, really big. 
- Oh, yes. 
- We may have reached her goal a little bit. [laughter] Forget the $117,000, whatever. Think about those numbers up there. 
- Forget the $117,000? 
- For a second! We're having a discussion. 
- I can't forget that. That's a lot of money. 
- Think about what the next five years you have in store for you. 
- Oh, that's a lot. 
- That's a lot. 
- I know. 
- What's in store for you in the five years? I don't-
- 
- My kids are going to college, and I don't want them to come out with a lot of loans, and that would really help. 
- That would do more than help. 
- Yes. 
- You guys. 
- What are you guys discussing? 
- I say she keeps going. 
- Keeps going. No counter. You're saying no counter. 
- Not yet. I think she saves the counter until-
- if she loses one of those. 
- Keep going, keep going. 
- It's exactly what he said. 
- One more, one more. 
- Oh, Howie. 
- Here's the thing. Right now, the only guarantee you have is $117,000, but you also have luck, you have risk, and you have $300,000 and $400,000 left in the game, so... 
- Oh, gosh. Oh. 
- I'm gonna ask you. Missy Silverman, the biggest decision so far of the night. 
- Oh, gosh, this is a big decision. 
- Missy Silverman, deal or no deal? 
- No deal. [crowd shouting] 
- I say, no deal! No deal. 
- Wow. 
- Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. I can't believe I did that. That's so much money. 
- It's a lot of money. The question now is, will your luck hold on? One more case. 
- Okay, one more case, and I want the $5. I want to see the $5. Oh, girls. Oh, all these numbers. 
- You know, it's possible that the $5 could be in this case, right? Just as much of a chance. 
- Oh. Oh! [laughter] Okay, let's go with 25! 
- Summer. 
- I don't even know. I'm scared. 
- Summer, anything. She wants the $5, but I would be happy with anything but the $300,000 or the $400,000. One more time. Hold onto that luck. 
- Oh, my gosh. 
- Summer, open the case. 
- I can't look. I'm scared. Please, low, low, five, low, low, low, low, low, I'm scared. 
- Well, you're amazing. I want my kids to go to your preschool. 
- Aww! 
- Not just because you're so kind and giving, but also, I think you're the only person who could run circles around them. 
- Oh, thank you. Give me a low number, please. [laughs] Please. [all groaning] [applause] 
- Okay, before she calls, I'm gonna tell you something. You still have a one out of four chance of walking out of here with $400,000. If you decide to go further, or you make an offer, and she doesn't accept it, and you're forced to go further, you have a three out of four chance of opening anything but the $400,000, which will make the offer after this one go up. 
- Okay. 
- So can you take the risk? Do you feel lucky? Do you want to make a counteroffer? We're about to get a call. Let's see what this is. 
- Oh, I'm so nervous. 
- Yes, of course, she's going to go down. Yeah. 
- I'm so nervous. 
- Hello. Okay. Okay. She said the safety net is gone. She said you're lucky, but not that lucky. 
- That's okay, that's okay. I'm still feeling lucky. 
- The offer dropped. 
- I knew it would. 
- The new offer is $84,000. 
- Talk to your family. 
- Talk to your family. 
- This is your counteroffer time. 
- Maybe now you counter. 
- One case to open. 
- How much? 
- I think $95,000. 
- Okay, okay. 
- You counter and you be happy. 
- Okay. I'm not really good at math. 
- Missy Silverman, deal or no deal? 
- Well, I think I might make a counteroffer, Howie. 
- Okay, counter up. And the offer is... [cheers and applause] 
- $95,000, there's the offer. 
- That's a lot of money. That is a lot of money. 
- Is the banker going to take the $95,000, or are you going to have to go on and open one more case, and if that happens, is the $400,000 still gonna stay in play? Do we accept? Is there risk? Is she lucky?

- Wow, Missy Silverman just made a counteroffer of $95,000. The banker's considering, so she's deep in thought. Very important decision, because if she takes it, you walk out of here with $95,000 and a beautiful girls' trip. You have the cruise with Princess Cruises, so you already have that, so it's a win-win. But if she says no and doesn't take your offer, the $95,000 comes off the table and you have to open another case. If that one more case you open is the $400,000, the most you can leave with is $50,000, so it's a really precarious time. [phone ringing] This is scary. 
- I'm scared. 
- I'm scared for you. 
- Thank you. 
- You're welcome. [laughter] 
- [sighs] That's a lot of money. 
- Right. Okay. All right. 
- Oh, what'd she say? 
- She said she's giving you a gift. 
- Oh, that's nice. She said that you've been saying all game, how lucky you are... 
- Oh, God. 
- And her gift to you... is the opportunity to prove it. It is no deal. 
- Oh, my God! 
- No! 
- Oh! 
- Play on. 
- I'm good with that. 
- You got this, you got it. 75% chance you're gonna win it. 
- All right, Miss. 
- Oh, I don't know. 
- We were even just second-guessing it, so that's good. 
- What case should I open? [crowd shouting] 
- I can tell you what case not to open. Do not open the $400,000 case. 
- Oh, I hope that doesn't happen. 
- That is the landmine. 
- Oh, gosh, all these numbers mean stuff to me. Oh, it's so hard. 8 is my birthday. 
- Right. 
- 13 is my son's birthday. And then 7 is my dad's birthday. Oh, my gosh, I don't know what to do. Okay, I'm gonna just say it. 
- Say it. 
- It's coming to me. I'm praying it's a low number. Number 7! Oh! 
- Oh, my God. 
- That's what I would pick. I would have picked that. 
- We're gonna pray, we're gonna pray. I'm praying. 
- This one case can make you or break you. 
- I hope it's make me. [laughter] 
- Jordana, anything, anything but $400,000. 
- So scary. 
- Open the case. 
- I'm not looking. Please, low. [cheers and applause] Yay, yay! That's good. 
- That's great. 
- That's good. 
- That's awesome! [cheers and applause] 
- I'm so happy! That's good. That's pretty good. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh. 
- Wow, look at that board now. So you got three cases left. One of them is holding $400,000. You believe it's this one? 
- I don't know. It could be. [phone ringing] Oh, no. Oh, I'm freaking out. Oh, Howie, banker, friends, husband... 
- Right. 
- Kids, audience. Hello, models. 
- Okay. 
- Oh, my gosh. 
- All right. 
- What'd she say? Please, shaking. 
- She said you pushed your luck. 
- Yes, you did. [cheers and applause] 
- Oh. Scary. 
- You say it paid off. 
- Yeah. 
- They're saying it paid off. Do you think it paid off? 
- I don't-
- I hope so, I hope so. Oh, I hope so. I hope it paid off. 
- It did, it did. 
- You would have walked out of here with $95,000, right? 
- If she took that counter, yes. 
- Yeah. 
- She didn't. 
- Would you walk out now for $165,000? 
- [exclaiming] [cheers and applause] [exclaiming] 
- Yes! 
- That's a lot of money. Oh, my gosh. That's a lot of money. What do I do? 
- Take it! 
- Yes! 
- Take it. 
- Let me ask you. [all chanting] Take that deal! 
- Deal? [all chanting] Take that deal! 
- Let me ask you, Missy Silverman, deal or no deal? [cheers and applause] 
- Deal? 
- Deal! 
- Deal, deal, deal! [cheers and applause] Thank you, thank you, oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! 
- Okay, come around here. Okay, so congratulations. You got $165,000, you got a dream vacation, okay, but we don't know if you made a good deal. 
- We don't. 
- Had you said no deal and you went one more time, the next case you would have opened would have been... 
- Eight. 
- Okay, Neka, open your case. 
- Oh! 
- Perfect timing. You got out right at the right time. You had the $50,000 case. Open your case. Wow, Missy Silverman is the lucky one. Ran inf here with $165,000,
