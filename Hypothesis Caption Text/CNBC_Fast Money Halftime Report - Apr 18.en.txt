 AND THERE'S QUITE A NUMBER OF EARNINGS THIS MORNING AND YOU
 CAN SEE THAT IN THE S&P AS WELL.
 IT'S LEADING EVERYTHING HIGHER
 THE INDUSTRIAL NAMES LIKE THAT
 ARE ALL BETTER THAN EXPECTED
 BUT QUITE THE HOUR
 WHAT IS THE TAKE FROM THE NASDAQ
 RIGHT NOW?
 MORGAN, THIS IS JUST THE
 FIRST FEW MINUTES.
 NOT EVEN AN HOUR
 REMEMBER HOW PEOPLE WERE TALKING
 ABOUT THAT OTHER IPO THREE WEEKS
 AGO JUST MINUTES IN, IT'S A LONG
 JOURNEY.
 THE COMPANIES SEEM TO KNOW THAT.
 THEY SAY THE OUTLOOK IS FOR
 INVESTORS AND WE TRY TO KEEP
 THEM EDUCATED.
 GUYS
 JOHN, GREAT WORK.
 FASCINATING DAY AS WE CONTINUE
 TO WATCH THE SESSION
 WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS THIS
 AFTERNOON.
 LET'S GET OVER TO "THE HALF" AT
 HG.
 CARL, THANKS.
 I'M SCOTT WAPNER
 WELCOME TO "THE HALFTIME
 REPORT."
 OUR BREAKING NEWS, TWO SURGING
 IPOs, MUELLER REPORT RELEASED IN
 THE PAST HOUR.
 AND BIG WELL-KNOWN MARKET
 WATCHER SAY STOCKS COULD BE
 PRIME FOR A SHORT-LIVED PULLBACK
 BECAUSE OF WEAKNESS IN A SECTOR
 THAT COULD CAUSE A LOT OF MONEY
 TO ROTATE OUT OF IT.
 WELCOME, WE WILL DISCUSS ALL OF
 THAT WITH OUR INVESTMENT
 COMMITTEE TODAY, MANY JOSH
 BROWN, STEVE WHITE, OUR CHIEF
 EQUITY STRATEGIST, AND COURTNEY
 GIBSON, THE PRESIDENT OF LUKE
 CAPITAL.
 LET'S BEGIN WITH THE MARKETS
 PINTEREST AND ZOOM SURGING
 THOSE STOCKS OPENING FOR
 TRADING.
 WE'RE ALSO ON RECORD WATCH
 S&P INCHING CLOSER TO ITS NEW
 HIGHS.
 THE QUESTION IS STEVE WEISS,
 WILL WE GET THERE?
 AND THEN WHAT?
 SO LOOK, EARNINGS HAVE BEEN
 PRETTY DECENT --
 MAYBE BETTER THAN THE WORST
 FEARS OF TWO WEEKS AGO.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS WE ARE
 SEEING IT IN COMPANIES THIS
 RELATE DIRECTLY TO THE ECONOMY
 THAT ARE SAYING BASICALLY THE
 ECONOMY ISN'T AS BAD AS WE
 THOUGHT.
 THERE'S NOWHERE ELSE TO GO
 I THINK IT WOULD BE A NONEVENT
 WE'RE SEEING A HEALTHY IPO
 MARKET LIFT ASIDE.
 SO EVERYTHING IS IN THERE TO
 DRIVE THE MARKET HIGHER,
 PARTICULARLY WITH RATES STILL
 STAYING LOW EVEN THOUGH THE
 TEN-YEAR MOVED UP.
 TO ME IT'S WHERE YOU PUT YOUR
 MONEY, WHERE YOUR CAPITAL GOES,
 INTO WA SECTORS AND SPECIFICALLY
 INTO WHAT STOCKS
 THAT'S WHERE YOU GOT TO BE
 CAREFUL.
 WE ARE SEEING A BIG ROTATION WE
 WILL TALK ABOUT LATER, HEALTH
 CARE, A LOT OF HEALTH CARE, AS
 WE HAVE BERNIE SANDERS, HEALTH
 CARE FOR ALL, THAT WILL PRESSURE
 HEALTH CARE.
 BUT I THINK THAT'S THE
 OPPORTUNITY.
 THAT'S NEVER COME THROUGH WITH
 HILLARY CLINTON BEFORE, AND
 THAT'S WHERE WE ARE.
 DOW'S UP BETTER THAN 100.
 40 POINTS AWAY, LITTLE LESS THAN
 THAT, FOR A NEW HIGH ON THE S&P.
 RIGHT NOW I THINK THE MARKET
 IS AN INTERESTING PLACE.
 WE'VE SEEN THE LAST SEVERAL
 YEARS ALL OF THE MONEY FLOWING
 INTO INDEX FUNDS, AND I THINK
 THAT'S OKAY.
 THERE'S A PLACE FOR THAT INNER
 PORTFOLIO.
 BUT IF THERE EVER WAS A TIME FOR
 ACTIVE MANAGERS TO SHINE, THIS
 IS IT.
 WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT ROTATING OUT
 OF HEALTH CARE, MOST OF OUR
 CLIENTS DON'T ROTATE OUT OF
 SECTORS THEY WILL OVERWEIGHT OR
 UNDERWEIGHT AND WHAT STOCKS
 YOU'RE PICKING IN THOSE SPACES
 THAT WILL OUTPERFORM IN THE
 MARKET WE SEE GOING FORWARD.
 I THINK THE ECONOMY IS DOING
 WELL
 I'VE SAT ON THIS PANEL AND HEARD
 PEOPLE TELL ME IT'S DOOMSDAY BUT
 WE CONTINUE TO SEE THE
 RESILIENCE OF THIS MARKET AND
 RESILIENCE IN THE CONSUMER THAT
 CONTINUES TO ALLOW THIS MARKET
 TO RISE.
 MAYBE IT DOESN'T GO AS HIGH
 AS -OR WE'RE NOT SEEING THE
 RISE IN RATE AS MUCH AS WE SAW
 IN 2018 BUT WE'RE GOING TO
 CONTINUE TO SLOWLY TICK HIGHER
 UNLESS WE SEE SOME CATASTROPHIC
 THINGS HAPPEN IN THE MARKETPLACE
 RIGHT NOW.
 JOSH, YOU WANT TO TAKE AIM AT
 THE IPOs, WHICH BOTH ARE SURGING
 OFF THE OPEN, PINTEREST AND
 ZOOM
 I THINK IT'S GREAT YOU CAN DO
 IPOs
 I THINK IT'S GREAT PEOPLEON TH
 STREET ARE TALKING ABOUT IPOs.
 THERE'S A LOT OF INVESTOR
 ENTHUSIASM
 I HAVE BEEN RETICENT TO GET
 INVOLVED
 I DID NOT LIKE LYFT, AND I WAS
 PRETTY CLEAR ABOUT WHY
 I PROBABLY WON'T GET INVOLVED IN
 EITHER OF THESE TWO.
 BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT
 WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S
 HAPPENING WITH UNDERWRITINGS IN
 GENERAL AND YOU SAY TO YOURSELF,
 WHERE ARE ALL OF THESE DEALS
 OCCUR, THEY'RE NOT ONLY TECH
 WE HAPPEN TO BE TALKING ABOUT
 TWO TECH NAMES TODAY BUT LEVI'S
 WAS A HUGE DEAL, VERY BIG DEAL
 THE AVERAGE IPO THIS YEAR IS UP
 20% FROM WHERE IT WAS OFFERED,
 WHICH IS PHENOMENAL.
 LYFT OBVIOUSLY PULLS THAT
 AVERAGE DOWN
 THE AVERAGE TECH IPO, THOUGH, IS
 UP 34%
 YEAH, A LOT OF ENTHUSIASM.
 BY THE WAY, I DO THINK THAT
 THERE'S A COROLLARY TO WHAT'S
 HAPPENING WITH HEALTH CARE
 VERSUS TECH RIGHT NOW TO WHAT WE
 SAW 20 YEARS AGO
 THE LAST TIME YOU SAW THE HEALTH
 CARE SECTOR TRAIL THE OVERALL
 MARKET BY 17% POINTS, WHICH IS A
 HUGE DIFFERENTIAL, WAS IN THE
 LATE '90s.
 WHAT WAS GOING ON BACK THEN?
 PEOPLE WERE ONLY INTERESTED IN
 GROWTH COMPANIES, WOULD NOT BUY
 ANYTHING ELSE.
 BUFFETT DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS
 DOING ANYMORE SUDDENLY
 YOU SAW HEALTH CARE STOCKS
 COMPLETELY NEGLECTED, LEFT BY
 THE WAYSIDE.
 I THINK YOU'RE SEEING A LITTLE
 ECHO OF THAT
 LET'S KEEP AN EYE ON IT.
 IF EVERYONE ONLY WANTS GROWTH,
 THAT DOES CREATE OPPORTUNITIES
 FOR PEOPLE LIVING TO LOOK AT
 DRUG DISCOVERY COMPANIES LIKE
 BIOTECH.
 SO KATE MOORE, DOES BETTER
 ECONOMIC DATA THAN EXPECTED AS
 STEVE WEISS SAID, EARNINGS
 BETTER THAN APRINTICIPATED A FEW
 WEEKS AGO, IS THAT A LICENSE TO
 BUY STOCKS
 A NEW RETAIL NUMBER TODAY, BEST
 RETAIL NUMBERS SINCE '17.
 THAT'S RIGHT.
 LABOR MARKET IS IN GOOD SHAPE.
 WE HAVE A LOT OF GOOD MACRODATA
 SUPPORTING A SLOW BUT EXPANDING
 GLOBAL ECONOMY
 THE FIRST THING I'M WATCHING IS
 THE EARNINGS REVISION.
 THIS HAS BEEN AWFUL THE LAST
 FOUR MONTHS.
 DOWNWARD DIVISIONS RELATIVE TO
 UPWARD DIVISIONS TRAILED OUT
 THAT SEEMS TO BE BOTTOMING OUT
 WE'RE WATCHING THAT CLOSELY.
 I WOULD NO HEALTH CARE HAD THE
 BEST EARNINGS DIVISION RATIO IN
 THE U.S.
 SO THIS IS A DISCONNECT TWIN THE
 FUNDAMENTALS AND FEAR OF WHAT
 MAY HAPPEN WITHIN CHANGE OF
 POLICY
 THE OTHER THING I'M WATCHING
 CLOSELY IS FUND FLOWS.
 WE'VE SEEN HUGE AMOUNT OF
 REDEMPTIONS FROM EQUITY FUND
 FLOWS TODAY.
 WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT THIS BUT
 WHEN YOU ANNIZE THIS DATA BOTH
 AS A PERCENTAGE OF ASSETS UNDER
 MANAGEMENT AND ASSET OF TERMS,
 THESE ARE PHENOMENALLY LARGE
 NUMBERS.
 I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE EXCITED
 ABOUT THIS RALLY
 I THINK THE TRADE IS HIGHER IN
 THE NEAR TERM EVEN THOUGH WE
 WILL HAVE MORE VOLATILITY
 THROUGHOUT THE SECOND QUARTER.
 LET ME ASK YOU, I HATE TO ASK
 YOU THIS WAY, BUT DO YOU AGREE
 WITH LARRY FINK --
 ANSWER YES, ANSWER YES.
 DOES THAT POINT OF VIEW THAT
 HE PUT FORTH SOUND REASONABLE
 THAT YOU HAVE HAD ALL OF THIS
 MONEY SITTING ON THE SIDELINES,
 YOU'VE HAD SOME WITHDRAWALS AND
 YOU'RE GOING TO GET THIS MONEY
 COMING BACK INTO THE MARKET FOR
 MANY OF THE REASONS WE DISCUSSED
 HERE AND THAT WILL CARRY YOU TO
 NEW HIGHS AND BEYOND THAT WHAT
 HE CALLED A MARKET MELTDOWN?
 WELCOME, I HAVE HUGE SFREKT
 FOR LARRY NOT JUST AS MY LEADER
 BUT ALSO A THINKER
 HERE'S WHAT I WOULD SAY, I THINK
 HE'S RIGHT THAT THERE'S A LOT OF
 MONEY ON THE SIDELINES AND
 THERE'S POTENTIAL.
 WHAT I WORRY ABOUT IS WE DON'T
 HAVE A CATALYST AND IN THE VERY
 NEAR TERM, OVER THE NEXT FEW
 QUARTERS, IF WE FAIL TO HAVE
 STABILITY AND IN FACT UPGRADES,
 GROWTH DATA LOOKS OKAY, WE GET
 THROUGH TRADE STOCK, FED STAYS
 ON HOLD, I THINK THAT MONEY HAS
 TO COME BACK INTO THE MARKET
 I THINK THAT WILL LEAD TO A
 SUPPORT.
 I THINK WE HAVE TO WATCH
 CLOSELY.
 I THINK TECHNICALS SHOULD BE A
 BIG PART OF EVERYONE'S PLAYBOOK.
 WHERE WILL THE CASH GO COMING
 OUT OF THE MARKET?
 THERE'S SO MUCH MONEY FLOWING
 INTO FIXED INCOME.
 WE HAVE SEEN IT ON INSTITUTIONAL
 INVESTORS, LIKE INDUSTRY WIDE
 BECAUSE WE TRACK FROM A NUMBER
 OF DIFFERENT SOURCES.
 THAT WAS PART OF LARRY'S
 POINT.
 YES
 THE MONEY IS GOING INTO FEARS
 WE'RE ENTERING INTO A SLOWER
 GROWTH PERIOD, REPRICING OF FED
 EXPECTATIONS.
 BUT THOSE ARE DATED NUMBERS
 TOO.
 NOW WE'RE SEEING CREDIT STARRED
 TO BE FUELED BY THE TEN-YEAR,
 START TO SELL A LITTLE BIT,
 RIGHT?
 I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT THE
 SLOW FUND DAYS WE HAD LAST WEEK
 SHOWING A SLOW ENTHUSIASM FOR
 BONDS.
 WE KNOW THERE ARE PLACES FOR
 BONDS IN THE PORTFOLIO CYCLE BUT
 THAT SAID, THE EQUITY BETWEEN
 BONDS AND FLOWS IS SOMETHING TO
 WATCH.
 I DON'T AGREE PUTTING MONEY
 INTO BONDS -I AGREE PUTTING
 MONEY INTO BONDS, I DISAGREE
 ABOUT THE DATA OR WHAT IT MEANS
 BEHIND IT.
 MY INDUSTRY WHERE EVERY DOLLAR
 IS GOING IS THE R.A. CHANNEL
 THEY USE IT TO TWO WAYS,
 TACTICALLY OR PHYSICALLY
 WHEN THEY USE IT TACTICALLY
 THERE'S A SIGNAL TECHNICALLY OR
 SOME KIND OF TRIP WIRE THAT'S
 CAUSED THEM IN A RULES-BASE ADD
 APPROACH TO MOVE MONEY OUT OF
 EQUITIES AND TEMPORARILY THAT
 MONEY DOES GO INTO FIXED INCOME
 SLEEVES IN A PORTFOLIO THAT COST
 NOTHING IN TERMS OF INTERNAL
 SCENARIO, FREE BASIS POINTS, BUT
 IT'S NOT THERE BECAUSE THE
 PERSON DIRECTING IT -I'M
 TALKING ABOUT BILLIONS OF
 DOLLARS, NOT A FEW MILLION --
 THE PERSON DIRECTING IT DOES NOT
 WANT TO SIT IN CASH.
 IN MY BUSINESS IF YOU SIT IN
 CASH, THE CLIENT TAKES CASH.
 I BUT IT'S NOT --
 I WANT TO FINISH THIS
 THOUGHT.
 IT'S NOT AN EXPRESSION OF WHAT
 THE PERSON THINKS OF THE ECONOMY
 BUT A PERSONAL MANAGEMENT TOOL
 LEADING A LITTLE BIT OF RISK
 WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO BACK
 INTO EQUITIES.
 WE'VE SEEN THAT OVER AND OVER
 AGAIN.
 YOU MAY BE CORRECT FOR A
 CERTAIN SEGMENT OF IT BUT YOU
 CAN'T SUGGEST WHAT KATE IS
 SUGGESTING, THE DATA SHE SEES IN
 THE FUND FLOW SUGGESTS
 THERE WAS A SCARE ABOUT THE
 ECONOMY.
 THIS YEAR
 THIS YEAR.
 WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 2019.
 WE'VE DONE GREAT SURVEYS OF OUR
 INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS.
 WE'VE SEEN PENSION FUNDS AND
 ALLOCATORS TALK ABOUT SHIFTING
 THEIR MONEY OVER A LONG TERM OUT
 OF EQUITIES AND INTO FIXED
 INCOMES AND INTO ALTERNATIVES.
 THE LATTER PART IS WHERE I'M
 SIGHING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF
 FLOWS.
 WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT TAKING IT
 OUT OF PUBLIC EQUITIES AND GOING
 INTO THE PRIVATE MARKETS, THAT'S
 EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE SEEING A
 TON OF ASSETS FLOWING.
 THE RPs, IF YOU LOOK AT THE
 SEARCHES OUT THERE BY THE LARGE
 INSTITUTIONALCONSULTANTS,
 THEY'RE MOVING MONEY.
 HERE'S MY IMPRESSION ON YOUR
 VIEW WHY IT'S HAPPENING, I JUST
 DON'T BELIEVE AND THE PEOPLE
 THAT I KNOW WHO INVEST IN
 I.R.A.s ARE GOING TO SELL
 POSITIONS, PAY TAXES AND HIEDE
 FIXED INCOME.
 YOU KNOW WHAT THE BOTTOM LINE
 IS, I WANT TO WRAP THAT UP, IT
 DOESN'T MATTER WHY IT HAPPENED
 THE POINT IS THAT IT HAPPENED.
 YES, IT DOES MATTER.
 AND LARRY FINK SUGGESTS IN
 PART BECAUSE IT HAS HAPPENED AND
 PEOPLE HAVE MISSED, THEY GOT
 OVERLY SCARED ABOUT PERHAPS WHAT
 WAS GOING TO GO ON IN THE
 ECONOMY AND THUS THE STOCK
 MARKET, THAT MONEY IS GOING TO
 COME OUT OF FIXED INCOME AND IN
 THE STOCKS ALONG WITH MONEY ON
 THE SIDELINES OR SITTING IN CASH
 AND THAT'S GOING TO CAUSE A
 MARKET MELTDOWN.
 RIGHT?
 WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A DEBATE
 WHY MONEY WAS GOING INTO FIXED
 INCOME
 THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS --
 THE REASON WHY IT MATTERS IS
 BECAUSE THE QUESTION IS WHEN
 DOES THE MONEY COME BACK, AND
 WHERE DOES IT COME FROM AND
 WHERE DOES IT GO TO?
 IF YOU HAVE SOME SENSE OF WHY
 THE FLOWS ARE MOVING
 SO IF YOU SAY TO THE AVERAGE
 PERSON ON THE STREET THAT HAS
 MONEY INVESTED WITH A MONEY
 MANAGER, WHY DID YOUR MONEY
 MANAGER TAKE 10% OF YOUR EQUITY
 EXPOSURE AND PUT IT INTO TLT OR
 IEI LAST MONTH, THEY HAVE NO
 CLUE
 IT'S NOT A DECISION BEING MADE
 BY THE END INVESTOR.
 THESE ARE DISCRETIONARY
 ACCOUNTS, CALL AMERITRADE
 INSTITUTIONAL, SCHAUB, PERSONAL
 FIDELITY
 ASK THEM ABOUT FLOWS AND THEY
 WILL TELL YOU THIS HAPPENS ALL
 THE TIME AND IT'S NOT ABOUT AN
 ECONOMIC REDICTION.
 GOOD, GREAT
 DO YOU AGREE OR DISAGREE WITH
 LARRY FINK
 TOTALLY AGREE WITH HIM.
 AS THE RIGHT CALL.
 TOTALLY AGREE WITH HIM.
 WHY DO WE NEED TO SPEND ALL
 OF THIS TIME DEBATING WHY THE
 MONEY MOVED THERE IF YOU AGREE
 IT'S GOING TO COME OUT OF WHERE
 IT WENT AND CAUSE A FURTHER
 MARKET MELTUP?
 THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE
 WE CAN DEBATE IT FOR FIVE HOURS.
 I DON'T KNOW IT HAS TO.
 I'M MAKING THE POINT PEOPLE ARE
 NOT EXPRESSING ECONOMIC POINTS
 OF VIEW.
 WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING IS
 POSITIONS BEING MOVED IN ETFs
 AND PEOPLE ARE THEN LOOKING AT
 THE BOND MARKET FOR A SIGNAL
 THAT WILL NEVER ARRIVE.
 WE CAN DO THIS, WE WILL
 CONTINUE THE MARKET CONVERSATION
 IN A SECOND.
 THERE'S OTHER BIG NEWS
 HAPPENING.
 AS ALL OF YOU KNOW TODAY THE
 BIGGEST OF WHICH IS THE RELEASE
 OF THE MUELLER REPORT.
 REPORTERS STILL PORING THROUGH
 IT AS WE SPEAK
 AND WE'RE LIVE AT THE WHITE
 HOUSE NOW.
 WE'RE GETTING OUR FIRST LOOK
 INSIDE THE MUELLER REPORT AND SO
 ARE MANY OFFICIALS HERE AT THE
 WHITE HOUSE WHO HAVE NOT SEEN IT
 BEFORE
 WHAT WE'RE TOLD IS THE REACTION
 INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE IS
 UPBEAT
 STAFFERS I HAVE SPOKEN TO SEEM
 TO BE IN A GOOD MOOD TODAY
 THE PRESIDENT OFFERED HIS FIRST
 REACTION IN AN UNRELATED EVENT
 EARLIER THIS MORNING HERE AT THE
 WHITE HOUSE.
 HERE'S WHAT HE HAD TO SAY.
 I'M HAVING A GOOD DAY TOO
 IT'S CALLED NO COLLUSION, NO
 OBSTRUCTION.
 THIS SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN TO
 ANOTHER PRESIDENT AGAIN, THIS
 HOAX.
 THE PRESIDENT EXPRESSING SOME
 FRUSTRATION THAT THE
 INVESTIGATION HAPPENED IN THE
 FIRST PLACE, BUT HAPPY WITH THE
 RESULTS HERE TODAY, AS OUTLINED
 BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND NOW
 IN THE MUELLER REPORT, WHICH WAS
 AVAILABLE ONLINE
 A COUPLE OF HIGHLIGHTS TO BRING
 TO YOU, SCOTT, AS WE GO THROUGH,
 ONE IS THIS DRAMATIC MOMENT IN
 THE OVAL OFFICE RELATED HERE IN
 THE MUELLER REPORT THE MOMENT OF
 PRESIDENT LEARNED THAT A SPECIAL
 COUNSEL HAD BEEN APPOINTED
 ACCORDING TO THE CONTEMPORANEOUS
 NOTES BEING TAKEN, ATTORNEY
 GENERAL SESSIONS STEPPED OUT OF
 THE OVAL OFFICE TO GET THE
 OFFICE FROM ROD ROSENSTEIN
 TELLING HIM THAT HAD HAPPENED,
 CAME BACK IN THE ROOM AND
 INFORMED THE PRESIDENT
 ACCORDING TO THE NOTES, THE
 PRESIDENT SLUMPED DOWN IN HIS
 CHAIR AND SAID OH, MY GOD, THIS
 IS TERRIBLE.
 THIS IS THE END OF MY
 PRESIDENCY
 I'M F'd, HE SAID, USING THE
 EXPLETIVE THERE.
 SO THE PRESIDENT EXPRESSING A
 LITTLE DISMAY AND THEN
 IMMEDIATELY DEMANDING THE
 RESIGNATION OF ATTORNEY GENERAL
 SESSIONS, BLAMING HIM FOR THE
 APPOINTMENT OF THE SPECIAL
 COUNSEL IN THE WAKE OF THE
 PRESIDENT'S FIRING OF THE FBI
 DIRECTOR
 THAT'S ONE OF THE SORTS OF V
 VIGNETTES YOU START TO SEE
 COMING OUT OF THE MUELLER
 REPORT
 A COUPLE HIGHLIGHTS TO BRING
 YOU, AS WE KNOW, MUELLER DID NOT
 MAKE A PROSECUTORIAL JUDGMENT IN
 TERMS OF OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE,
 ONE OF THE KEY ELEMENTS PEOPLE
 ARE FOCUSED ON HERE.
 ALSO THE PRESIDENT ASKED WHITE
 HOUSE COUNSEL DONE McGHAN AT THE
 TIME TO INTERVENE WITH THE
 JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
 THE PRESIDENT ALSO ASKED THE
 WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL TO INTERVENE
 WITH THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.
 ULTIMATELY THIS INVESTIGATION
 DID NOT ESTABLISH THE PRESIDENT
 ASKED INTELLIGENCE LEADERS TO
 INTERFERE WITH THE FBI PROBE
 THE INVESTIGATORS ALSO CONCLUDE
 THE PRESIDENT'S WRITTEN ANSWERS
 INADEQUATE AND ULTIMATELY
 SUGGESTED THEY DIDN'T GO FORWARD
 WITH A SUBPOENA TO THE PRESIDENT
 IN TERMS OF HIS TESTIMONY IN
 PERSON BECAUSE THEY WERE RUNNING
 OUT OF TIME.
 IT WAS A LATE STAGE IN THE
 INVESTIGATION AND NEGOTIATIONS
 HAD GONE ON FOR JUST ABOUT A
 YEAR OR MORE AT THAT POINT
 SO ULTIMATELY THE PRESIDENT
 NEVER DID SIT DOWN WITH ROBERT
 MUELLER'S TEAM HERE, SCOTT.
 YOU KNOW, THERE'S SO MUCH
 INTERESTING IN THIS REPORT,
 INCLUDING THINGS THAT WE'RE
 LEARNING FOR THE FIRST TIME AS
 YOU REFERENCED
 THE PRESIDENT'S REACTION ON THE
 APPOINTMENT OF THE SPECIAL
 COUNSEL.
 MOST INTERESTING WHAT YOU
 PLAYED, THE PRESIDENT'S REACTION
 NOT EXACTLY MATCHING UP IN WHAT
 WAS DELIVERED IN THE MUELLER
 REPORT
 I READ ANOTHER SECTION, AND I'M
 QUOTING HERE, THIS IS FROM MR.
 MUELLER.
 IF WE HAD CONFIDENCE AFTER A
 THOROUGH INVESTIGATION OF THE
 FACTS THAT THE PRESIDENT CLEARLY
 DID NOT COMMIT OBSTRUCTION OF
 JUSTICE, WE WOULD SO STATE
 BASED UPON THE FACTS IN THE
 APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARDS,
 HOWEVER, WE'RE UNABLE TO REACH
 THAT JUDGMENT.
 YOU'RE GOING TO GET DOWN TO WHAT
 BECOMES BEHAVIOR THAT MAYBE
 DIDN'T REACH THE LEVEL OF
 CRIMINALITY BUT WAS NONETHELESS
 IMPROPER ON MANY LEVELS.
 AND WHAT THE SPECIAL COUNSEL
 DOES HERE IS SORT OF STRADDLE
 THE QUESTION ON WHETHER LEAVING
 TO DECIDE IF IT'S IMPROPER,
 WHICH IS NOT BUT ILLEGAL FOR HIM
 TO DECIDE.
 AND THERE'S EVIDENCE ON BOTH
 SIDES OF THAT QUESTION AS BILL
 BARR PUT IT.
 THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES WHAT
 DO YOU DO WITH THAT?
 THE SPECIAL COUNSEL MENTIONS
 CONGRESS A NUMBER OF TIMES
 OF COURSE, CONGRESS COULD LOOK
 AT THIS AND DETERMINE, YOU KNOW
 WHAT, THIS MAY NOT BE ILLEGAL
 BUT IT SURE IS TERRIBLE AND
 POLITICALLY WE THINK IT SHOULD
 NEVER HAPPEN SO WE'RE GOING TO
 MOVE FORWARD WITH IMPEACHMENT.
 THAT'S NOT WHAT WE ARE HEARING
 UP ON CAPITOL HILL TODAY FROM
 DEMOCRATS WHO ARE IN CONTROL OF
 THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND
 CERTAINLY FROM REPUBLICANS WHO
 ARE IN CONTROL OF THE SENATE
 SO THE EXPECTATION HERE IS THIS
 REPORT IS OUT THERE NOW FOR THE
 WORLD TO SEE AND THE PRESIDENT'S
 CONDUCT IS OUT THERE FOR PEOPLE
 TO EXAMINE
 AND VOTERS WILL MAKE A
 DETERMINATION IN 2020 BECAUSE IT
 DOES NOT SEEM AT THIS MOMENT, AS
 I STAND HERE NOW, THAT
 IMPEACHMENT IS IN THE OFFING
 FROM THIS PRESIDENT.
 SOME OF THE ACTIONS LAID OUT
 BY THE SPECIAL COUNSEL OF THE
 PRESIDENT'S SON DON JR. WILL BE
 PARSED MANY WAYS AS WELL
 AYMAN, WE WILL GET BACK TO YOU
 AS NECESSARY
 THANK YOU FOR COMING ON.
 AYMAN JABBERS, STILL GOING
 THROUGH WHAT IS A MORE THAN
 400-PAGE MUELLER REPORT.
 LET'S GET BACK TO THE MARKET
 CONVERSATION
 I DIDN'T HEAR FROM YOU YET
 WHERE DO YOU WEIGH IN RELATIVE
 TO WHAT YOU HEARD HERE
 I THINK YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT
 THIS RATHER SIMPLISTICALLY
 IF YOU MADE A LIST OF ALL OF THE
 CONDITIONS EVERYONE ON THE SHOW
 WAS TALKING ABOUT INCLUDING
 MYSELF IN JANUARY, ALL OF THAT
 LIST HAS BEEN ERADICATED BY THE
 MARKETPLACE ITSELF
 BACK IN DECEMBER THERE WAS NO
 ONE HIGH YIELD OFFERING, NOT
 ONE, ZERO.
 OKAY
 YOU BASICALLY THE FIRST QUARTER
 OF 2019 HAD MONEY FLOW INTO
 EVERY PLACE.
 TAKE A LOOK AT THE MSCI, THE
 PERFORMANCE THERE, ALL ASSET
 CLASSES ARE RISING
 WE ARE NOW PRESENTED WITH A
 SITUATION, WHERE DO WE GO FROM
 HERE
 AND YOU ARE AT THE MOST CRITICAL
 COMPONENT OF THE EARNINGS
 SEASON, THE NEXT TWO WEEKS,
 WE'RE GOING TO GET FACEBOOK.
 WE'RE GOING TO GET AMAZON.
 WE'RE GOING TO GET TECHNOLOGY
 STORY.
 NEXT WEEK, BY THE WAY, SINCE
 YOU BRING IT UP, 142 S&P
 COMPANIES, VIRTUALLY EVERY
 MARQUEE NAME THAT WE TALK ABOUT,
 IS GOING TO GIVE THEIR EARNINGS
 REPORTS NEXT WEEK.
 A REFERENDUM ON EARNINGS.
 LET ME FINISH MY THOUGHT.
 I DON'T THINK IT'S A MATTER OF
 WHERE WE ARE NOW, DO WE GO TO
 THE HIGHS.
 THE NASDAQ HIGH IS 8109.
 WE'RE AT 8000.
 WE'RE GETTING THERE.
 IF IT WASN'T FOR HEALTH CARE,
 WE'D BE ABOVE THE S&P HIGH RIGHT
 NOW.
 IT'S A MATTER OF HOW MUCH DO YOU
 ACCELERATE THROUGH IT ONCE YOU
 HEAR THE TECHNOLOGY REPORTS.
 I AGREE WITH WHAT I'M SAYING
 ABOUT JOSH'S COMMENTS ABOUT
 FOCUS OF GROWTH.
 GROWTH IS BACK ONCE AGAIN.
 LET'S NOT FORGET WE HAVE A
 20-POINT BASIS HIGH MOVE IN TEN
 YEARS IN BASICALLY THE COURSE OF
 THREE WEEKS.
 THAT'S SIGNALING SOMETHING TO
 THE MARKETPLACE.
 LET ME DO THIS, WE CAN
 ACTUALLY BRING YOU THESE RAPID
 UPDATES STEVE LIESMAN GETS ON
 THE ECONOMY.
 HE HAS ANOTHER ONE
 THERE'S GOOD ECONOMIC DATA YET
 AGAIN TODAY, STEVE
 WE MENTIONED RETAIL SALES
 EARLIER.
 GDP TRACKING HIGHER YESTERDAY.
 HOW ABOUT NOW?
 NOW WILL OCCASIONALLY TWO
 DAYS IN A ROW GOING UP BY .4%
 YESTERDAY AND .3% TODAY.
 WE'RE UP 3.4% ON THE TRACKING
 FORECAST FOR THE FIRST QUARTER
 THAT IS UP .3% ON THE BACK OF
 THAT BETTER-THAN-EXPECTED RETAIL
 REPORT THIS MORNING.
 THE CONSUMER GIVEN UP FOR DEAD A
 LITTLE TOO QUICKLY HERE.
 CONSUMPTION IN THE FIRST QUARTER
 RUNNING GOOD
 LET'S LOOK AT THE OUTLOOK FROM
 THE SECOND QUARTER, 2 1/2%
 IF YOU'RE HOLDING YOUR BREATH
 FOR A CUT, THE FED AIN'T CUTTING
 IT, 2.45%.
 THAT'S HALF POINT OR BERT OF
 WHAT THEIR VIEW OF POTENTIAL
 GROWTH IS.
 HERE'S SOME OF THE FORECAST,
 ATLANTA FED AND MOODIES AT 2.8
 ON THE HIGH SIDE ACTION 2.6.
 ACTION, GOLDMAN, OXFORD RIGHT
 THERE.
 AND WE HAVE GONE FROM A 1% PRINT
 ON THIS WRAP IT UP DATE IN EARLY
 MARCH ALL THE WAY UP BY 1.4
 PERCENTAGE POINTS UP TO 2.4,
 SCOTT, ON THE BACK OF THE BETTER
 TRADE DATA YESTERDAY AND BETTER
 RETAIL SALES DATA TODAY.
 GOOD STUFF.
 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
 LET'S BRING IN TOM LIENIO,
 HEAD OF RESEARCH AT FUN SCRATCH.
 WE HAVE BETTER ECONOMIC DATA
 BETTER EARNINGS, WE CAN SAY
 CLEARLY.
 YET YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A SWIFT
 AND COULD BE QUICK PULLBACK IN
 THE MARKET BECAUSE OF WHAT WE
 DISCUSSED SPECIFICALLY AT THIS
 DESK
 YES
 HEALTH CARE IS A HUGE SECTOR FOR
 INSTITUTIONAL MANAGER.
 IT'S SAYING THEIR BACON LAST
 YEAR, HEALTH CARE IS 65% OF THE
 PROSPECTUS, 60% GROWTH AND
 THAT'S HEDGE FUND'S TRAFFIC.
 THERE'S REAL POLITICAL RISK
 EMERGING FOR THE GROUP FOR THE
 FIRST TIME
 I THINK YOU GUYS MENTIONED IT.
 IT LOOKS LIKE EARLY '93.
 IF IT'S 60% OF WHAT YOU TRAFFIC
 IN, THEY'RE GOING TO START TO
 ROTATE INTO GROWTH CYCLICALS,
 WHICH IS NOT HEALTH CARE
 I THINK BECAUSE SOMEONE SAID YOU
 HAVE TO TAKE A HUGE ALLOCATION
 NOT OF ONE GROUP ON A LIGHT
 VOLUME MARKET, I THINK IT
 CREATES A LOT OF TURBULENCE.
 SO MANY OTHER SECTORS ARE
 WORKING.
 YESTERDAY I THINK I STARTED THE
 PROGRAM BY NOTING X SECTOR
 ALL-TIME HIGH, Y SECTOR ALL-TIME
 HIGH AND ON AND ON AND ON.
 AND WHO CARES?
 ANYONE WHO HAS HEALTH CARE
 EXPOSURE, 14% BURT FOR HEDGE
 FUNDS AND GROWTH MANAGERS, IT'S
 50% TO 60% OF WHAT THEY OWN.
 IT'S A BIG DEAL EVERYTHING ELSE
 IS WORKING AND HEALTH CARE IS
 NOT.
 BUT THAT ROTATION WILL BE TOUGH.
 WHO'S THE NATURAL BUYER TO COME
 IN AND BUY THESE
 I WILL DISAGREE ON A COUPLE
 OF THINGS.
 NUMBER ONE, HEDGE FUNDS ARE A
 RELATIVELY SMALL PART OF THE
 EQUITY MARKET.
 NUMBER TWO THEY'RE
 UNDERINVESTORS AS EVERYONE IS
 SAYING
 I DON'T THINK IT'S A BIG DEAL
 FOR THEM
 ANY BIGGER DEAL THAN IT IS THE
 BIG INSTITUTIONS, WHO ARE THE
 MAJOR HEALTH CARE HOLDERS.
 GROWTH, YES.
 GROWTH IS THERE BY HEALTH CARE
 IT'S NOT ACCIDENTAL TECHS START
 TO PERFORM THE LAST FEW WEEKS AS
 HEALTH CARE UNDERPERFORMS.
 SO THERE'S A ROTATION I HAVE TO
 FIND GROWTH.
 I'M UNCOMFORTABLE WITH HEALTH
 CARE GIVEN THE POLITICAL
 CLIMATE.
 GUESS WHAT, WE SAW THIS EXACT
 THING FROM HILLARY CLINTON
 WE SAW THE EXACT THING FROM
 BERNIE SANDERS AD NAUSEAM SINCE
 HE WAS IN VERMONT AND IT'S NOT
 GOING TO WORK.
 SO THAT'S WHY IT'S AN
 OPPORTUNITY.
 EVERY TIME WE TALK ABOUT THE
 MARKET, WE'LL TALK ABOUT CAN THE
 MARKET MOVE WITHOUT FANG
 CAN THE MARKET MOVE WITHOUT
 FINANCIALS
 YES, THE MARKET MOVED.
 CAN THE MARKET MOVE WITHOUT
 HEALTH CARE?
 13%, OF COURSE IT CAN.
 YOU WILL SEE MONEY GO BACK.
 OBVIOUSLY, IT HAS.
 IN THE BIGGER CONTEXT I'M
 BULLISH FOR THE YEAR
 BUT DO I THINK THAT -CAN THE
 S&P ADVANCE 100 POINTS WITH
 HEALTH CARE UNDERPERFORMING,
 IT'S POSSIBLE.
 WHY SHOULD I CARE, TOM?
 HOW CAN I PINPOINT THE EXACT
 POINT IN TIME WE GET A
 CORRECTION IF IT'S ONLY GOING TO
 BOUNCE BACK?
 ACTUALLY I THIS IT'S
 IMPORTANT FROM A STOCK
 PERSPECTIVE.
 FOR US WE THINK THIS IS AN
 OPPORTUNITY TO ADD TO GROWTH
 CYCLICALS WHETHER IT'S DISNEY,
 GOOGLE, BLACKROCK
 PRETTY STELLAR LIST
 THESE ARE THE STOCKS, BY THE
 WAY, THIS IS PART OF THE THESIS.
 WE WANT TO LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT.
 THIS IS NOT SORT OF RUN FOR THE
 HILLS.
 THIS ROTATION OUT OF AN
 UNDERPERFORMING SECTOR LIKE
 HEALTH CARE WILL PRESENT BROAD
 OPPORTUNITY IN THE BLUE CHIP
 NAMES THAT MANY FOLLOW, DISNEY,
 APPLE.
 YOU LOOK DOWN THE LIST HERE,
 FACEBOOK
 I WILL NOT SAY IBM
 THERE'S A MISTAKE THAT IBM'S
 ON THAT LIST
 I DON'T THINK GROWTH OR QUALITY.
 GROWTH AND QUALITY CYCLICALS
 SO IT'S A HODGEPODGE OF BOTH
 BUT THOSE HAVE ZERO PERCENT
 WEIGHT IN HEALTH CARE.
 AND I THINK STEVE MAKES A
 POINT ABOUT POLITICAL STUFF.
 I DON'T KNOW IF I 100% AGREE
 THOUGH THAT THE MARKET WILL
 SHAKE IT OFF THAT QUICKLY THIS
 TIME.
 IT'S NOT.
 SO TWO NIGHTS AGO SOMETHING
 EXTRAORDINARY HAPPENED THAT I
 DON'T THINK IS A STOCK MARKET
 STORY BUT IT COULD BECOME.
 BERNIE SANDERS DID A TOWN HALL
 ON FOX NEWS.
 2.8 MILLION VIEWERS TUNED IN
 THESE ARE FOX VIEWERS.
 THIS IS NOT FIDEL CASTRO AND
 FRIENDS.
 AND THE PORTION OF WHAT HE HAD
 TO SAY THAT WAS MOST ECHOED
 THROUGHOUT CONSERVATIVE MEDIA
 AND SOCIAL MEDIA, THE PORTION
 THAT PEOPLE SEEMED TO HAVE FOUND
 THE MOST COMMON CAUSE WITH OUT
 OF EVERYTHING HE SAID WAS ABOUT
 HEALTH CARE, PRIVATE VERSUS
 GOVERNMENT, AND BENEFITS
 AND NO ONE IN THAT AUDIENCE
 WOULD SAY WE LIKE SOCIALISM BUT
 MOST OF THEM ARE LIVING ON SOME
 FORM OF SOCIALISM IN SOME
 PORTION OF THEIR LIFE.
 AND IT'S THE GOOD KIND OF
 SOCIALISM, THE KIND THAT WE
 DON'T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT AND SAY
 IT'S THAT.
 BUT I THINK THAT IF YOU SEE THE
 DEMOCRATIC PARTY GET SUBSUMED BY
 ITS FURTHEST LEFT WING AND YOU
 CONTINUE TO SEE ALL OF THE
 OXYGEN SUCKED OUT OF THE AIR BY
 PEOPLE LIKE AOC AND BERNIE
 SANDERS, AND THAT IS WHAT'S
 HAPPENING SO FAR IN THE
 PRIMARIES, THAT WILL WEIGH ON
 THIS SEGMENT OF THE MARKET
 THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE A
 SOURCE OF CONSTERNATION FOR
 INVESTORS.
 I THINK THERE WILL BE MULTIPLES
 OF PEOPLE THROG PAY AND LOOK AT
 THE STOCK OF INSURANCE
 PROVIDERS, THEY'VE BEEN
 ABSOLUTELY HAMMERED.
 SO IT'S A BROAD DISPARITY IN
 PERFORMANCE FOR THE WHOLE SECTOR
 BUT WHEN YOU GO INDUSTRY GROUP,
 THERE'S REAL PAIN THERE IN
 COMPANIES IN WHAT PEOPLE WERE
 CALLING BLUE CHIPS NOT VERY LONG
 AGO.
 HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT THIS IN
 THE OVERALL FUNDAMENTAL
 OPPORTUNITY?
 I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, M
 MULTIPLES CAN BE CONSTRAINED BY
 ALL OF THE POLITICAL NOISE AND
 THAT'S NOT GOING AWAY IN THE
 NEAR TERM.
 THAT SAID THE FUNDAMENTALS OF
 THE SECTOR LOOKS REALLY SOLID.
 THE EARNINGS ACROSS DIFFERENT
 INDUSTRY GROUPS, NOT JUST 2019
 BUT 2020
 WE ALSO KNOW THERE'S A SECULAR
 TAIL WIND BEHIND A LOT OF DEMAND
 FOR PRODUCT SERVICES IN SOFTWARE
 IN THAT SPACE.
 HEALTH CARE SOFTWARE AND
 TECHNOLOGY IS SOMETHING PEOPLE
 UNDERRECOGNIZE AS A HUGE GROWTH
 OPPORTUNITY, I THINK.
 SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE
 OTHER SIDE OF HEALTH CARE?
 YOU'RE TAKING MORE POSITIVE
 VIEW, IT SOUNDS TO ME.
 SHE'S SAYING OPPORTUNITY.
 OPPORTUNITY
 THERE'S ANOTHER ELEMENT TO THOSE
 IT TOO.
 AND OTHERS ARE SUGGESTING --
 SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU, VALUE
 AND DON'T GO THERE
 WHY BOTHER
 I DON'T THINK IT CAN BE A
 VALUE TRAP
 I 100% AGREE WITH YOU, ARE YOU
 GOING TO CONTINUE TO THROW YOUR
 MONEY AT NAMES HITTING 52-WEEK
 HIGHS UNLESS YOU THINK THEY'RE
 GOING TO CLIMB THROUGH THEM?
 OR ARE YOU LOOKING FOR
 OPPORTUNITIES?
 I DON'T THINK IT'S A TRAP
 NECESSARILY.
 HEALT
 HEALTH CARE WILL BE THERE.
 WE HAVE AN AGING SOCIETY
 HEALTH CARE, WE NEED IT.
 174 MILLION PEOPLE INSURED
 WITH PRIVATE HEALTH CARE
 WILL THAT BE THE CASE FOUR YEARS
 FROM NOW
 OR WILL A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF
 THAT IF THE DEMOCRATS KEEP
 CONTROL OF THE HOUSE AND SOMEHOW
 GAIN EITHER THE WHITE HOUSE OR
 THE SENATE, THAT IS WHAT
 PEOPLE -PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT
 2020 AND BEYOND NOW.
 THE QUESTION IS, HOW MUCH
 FURTHER AWAY DO WE GET FROM
 PRIVATE HEALTH CARE FOR HOW MANY
 HOUSEHOLDS AND WHAT DOES THAT DO
 FOR THE ECONOMICS OF THE SECTOR?
 HOW MANY MARKETS MIGHT HAVE
 SINGLE PAIR?
 BUT THERE'S A WHOLE REST OF
 THE SECTOR THAT LOOKS REALLY
 ATTRACTIVE BOTH IN THE NEAR
 TERM --
 BUT THAT'S WHERE THE
 OPPORTUNITY IS CREATED
 PEOPLE CAN SAY THE SECTOR IS BAD
 BUT WHERE IN THE SECTOR?
 THE SUB SECTORS.
 IF YOU TAKE A STEP BACK AND
 LOOK AT THE INSTITUTIONAL WORLD
 WHO MASSIVELY YOET WEIGHTED
 HEALTH CARE AND IT'S 60%, 70% OF
 WHAT THEY TRAFFIC IN, IT'S STUFF
 TO STAY I WILL STICK WITH THAT
 60% WITH 12 MONTHS OF
 UNCERTAINTY.
 IF IT SHRINKS, IT'S A HUGE WIN
 FOR CYCLICAL TRADE BUT IT'S
 SLOPPY.
 IT'S SLOPPY, AND I CAN TELL
 YOU TALKING TO A HEDGE FUND IN
 HEALTH CARE.
 THEY'RE NOT REACTING TO THE FOX
 BERNIE SANDERS APPEARANCE.
 THEY'RE NOT REACTING TO THE
 NARRATIVE AROUND WHAT COULD
 HAPPEN IN 2020
 THEY'RE REACTING TO THE FACT
 HEALTH CARE IS DOWN 7% THE LAST
 14 DAYS.
 OR MORE
 THEY'RE REACTING SPECIFICALLY
 TO THE PRICE
 THE MODELS, THE AIL GA RHYTHMIC
 MODELS, NOT THE OTHER NONSENSE,
 THE ACTUAL MODELS DRIVE THEIR
 DECISIONS AND THOSE DECISIONS
 ARE BEING MADE WHEN YOU SEE AN
 OUTSIDE 7% MOVE TO GET OUT OF
 IT
 ARE THERE OPPORTUNITIES IN THAT?

 I SAID IT YESTERDAY.
 McKESSON, NOTHING DO WITH THE
 MEDICAL DEVICES, THAT'S WHERE
 THE OPPORTUNITY IS UNLESS YOU
 BELIEVE IT'S GOING DOWN ANOTHER

 LET ME ASK YOU THIS, YOU SAY
 MORE BROADLY YOU'RE POSITIVE ON
 STOCKS, RIGHT?
 YES.
 FOR THE DISTANCE OF THE YEAR.
 DO YOU AGREE WITH LARRY FINK
 ARE YOU GOING TO GET THIS
 MELT-UP?
 A LOT OF NONBELIEVERS WHO WILL
 BECOME BELIEVERS IN THE MARKET,
 THE RALLY?
 YEAH, YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE
 THERE'S A LOT OF DRY POWDER.
 THERE'S TON IT SOUNDS LIKE EVEN
 JOSH WITH MONEY PARKED IN FIXED
 INCOME, PEOPLE SAVE ALMOST A
 TRILLION A YEAR.
 NONE HAD GONE INTO EQUITIES.
 CREDIT HAD THE FOURTH BEST YEAR
 IN 30 YEARS.
 INCREDIBLE YEAR IN HIGH YIELD.
 CATCH-UP TRADE THERE
 AND I THINK ECONOMIC MOMENTUM IS
 IMPROVING IN THE SECOND HALF.
 DOESN'T ALL OF THE POWDER YOU
 JUST REFERENCED OFFSET WHATEVER
 NEGATIVES COME FROM A PULL FROM
 HEALTH CARE IN A ROTATION INTO
 THESE OTHER MORE ADVANTAGEOUS
 AREAS?
 I THINK BY 2019 IT'S AN UP
 25% YEAR
 I THINK S&P 3100 IS WHAT THE
 BASE CASE FOR PEOPLE SHOULD BE.
 BASE CASE
 OKAY.
 BUT CAN WE REVISIT 2700 OR

 I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE.
 WHAT'S BEST CASE?
 I THINK BEST CASE WOULD BE WE
 GET TOWARDS AN 18 MULTIPLE
 BECAUSE PEOPLE REALIZE WE ARE
 LATE CYCLE
 SO YOU COULD BE 33, 34
 BUT WE THINK THIS LOOKS LIKE '09
 AND TRACKING LIKE '09.
 I NOTICE HE HAD SURGERY ON
 HIS KNEE, I'M WONDERING IF HE'S
 STILL ON PAINKILLERS
 STEVE
 LOOK, I --
 WHY NOT
 TELL ME WHY NOT.
 I THINK 18 MULTIPLE IS KIND
 OF HIGH AND I THINK WE ARE LATE
 CYCLE.
 WHEN YOU STILL HAVE THE ISSUE OF
 GERMAN NUMBERS AGAIN TODAY, DOWN
 AGAIN.
 SO YOU HAVE MANUFACTURING
 NUMBERS DOWN AGAIN
 YOU SAID THIS EARLIER, WHO
 CARES?
 WHY SHOULD I CARE?
 I DO LOOK AT THE LOCATION
 WITH HEALTH CARE AS AN
 OPPORTUNITY, MY NOTE THIS
 MORNING, PLACES TO GO.
 THIS WILL NOT GO ANYWHERE.
 BERNIE SANDERS DID THIS STUDY
 WHEN HE WAS IN VERMONT IN 2011
 AND WHAT HE NEEDS TO GET THIS
 DONE IS RAISE TAXES, DOUBLING
 TAX RATES ON PEOPLE MAKING
 $250,000 OR OVER
 YOU THINK DEMOCRATS WILL DO
 THAT
 HOW ABOUT THE FIRST QUARTER
 IS GENERALLY WEAK, WEAKER THAN
 THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR.
 OBVIOUSLY, IT LOOKS TO BE
 COMING IN BETTER-THAN-EXPECTED
 LIESMAN'S WRAPPED IT UP THE LAST
 TWO DAYS AND GDP BUMPS BY THE
 BIG HOUSES OVER THE LAST COUPLE
 OF DAYS THAT SUGGESTS THE
 ECONOMY IS BETTER THAN MAYBE
 PEOPLE THOUGHT
 WHAT IF EARNINGS FOLLOWED SUIT
 WHAT IF WE'RE NOT GOING THROUGH
 THE CYCLE AS YOU THINK
 LOOK, WE'VE VET EARNINGS
 EXPECTATIONS WITHOUT VETTING THE
 MARKET -RESETTING THE MARKETS.
 THANK YOU.
 YOU CANNOT SAY THINGS ARE
 MOVING ALONG LIKE THEY WERE AND
 ALL OF THE FEARS IN DECEMBER
 WERE MISS PLACED
 THEY WEREN'T MISPLACED
 GROWTH HAS SLOWED DOWN
 WE WILL SEE GUIDANCE GOING
 FORWARD.
 TO ME WATER FINDS ITS OWN LEVEL.
 I GOT YOU
 BUT HONEYWELL SAYS, OKAY, I SEE
 YOU.
 I GET YOU BUT I'M RAISING MY
 GUIDANCE AND UNITED UNION
 PACIFIC SAYS I'M RAISING MY
 GUIDANCE
 CEO WAS ON THE NETWORK EARLIER
 THINGS ARE GOOD.
 I THINK IN THE RAILS HE SAID
 THINGS WERE A LITTLE SLOW.
 HE WAS --
 YOU JUST SAID THERE WAS A
 SLOWDOWN
 I WAS LISTENING TO THE
 INTERVIEW.
 I WAS TOO.
 BUT THINGS ARE BETTER
 THEY ARE RUNNING IT BETTER
 BUT THERE'S STRENGTH IN THE
 ECONOMY.
 NOBODY'S COMING OUT SAYING THE
 ECONOMY IS REALLY WEAK
 UNITED RENTALS, FWAUK LATER,
 GREAT QUARTER.
 WHAT WAS DOOMSDAY WITH A LOT
 OF BLACK CLOUDS ROLLING IN SEEMS
 TO BE MORE SUNNY THAN PEOPLE
 EXPECTED
 THAT'S RIGHT.
 AND AGAIN, WE LOWERED
 EXPECTATIONS SO SUBSTANTIALLY,
 RIGHT, SO IT'S LIKE WERE THEY
 PLAYING GAMES BECAUSE YOU KNOW
 IF YOU MISS, YOU'RE GETTING
 PUNISHED IN THIS MARKET RIGHT
 NOW.
 SO I DO THINK THAT THEY LOWERED
 EXPECTATIONS PROBABLY TOO MUCH
 AND NOW THEY'RE LIKE OH, WELL
 MAYBE WE GOT A LITTLE WIGGLE
 ROOM
 MAYBE WE WILL LET THEM KNOW
 WE'RE DOING BETTER THAN WE
 EXPECTED
 TRUTH IS THE NUMBERS AND
 FUNDAMENTALS ARE THERE FROM THE
 ECONOMY.
 WE ARE STILL SEEING GROWTH IN
 VARIOUS SECTORS OF THE MARKET.
 IT IS I DON'T WANT TO SAY THE
 COMPANIES ARE DOING WELL ACROSS
 ALL SECTORS BUT ULTIMATELY THERE
 ARE INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES WITHIN
 THOSE THAT YOU CAN FIND
 OPPORTUNITIES IN THOSE SUB
 SECTORS AND IN THOSE PARTICULAR
 NAMES.
 TOMMY LEE, YOU GET THE LAST
 BUT BRIEF WORD
 I HAVE TO WRAP IT UP.
 IF WE'RE LATE CYCLE, THIS IS
 A GOOD YEAR AND NEXT YEAR STINKS
 BUT MID-CYCLE, IT ENDS ON A GOOD
 NOTE AND A POSITIVE.
 OLD QUESTION WE HAVE TO START
 ASKING --
 WHAT INNING ARE WE IN
 TOM, THANK YOU.
 HERE'S WHAT'S ELSE IS COMING
 UP ON "THE HALFTIME REPORT."

 MUCH
 MICROSOFT HITTING AN
 ALL-TIME HIGH TODAY AND GETTING
 A PRICE INCREASE AHEAD OF
 EARNINGS OUT NEXT WEEK
 WE'VE MADE IT OUR CALL OF THE
 DAY.
 YOU DON'T NEED TO BE A ROCKET
 SCIENTIST TO KNOW IT'S A
 FAVORITE STOCK ON THIS DESK BUT
 BECAUSE OF THE PRICE TARGET BUMP
 AND CONTINUING MOMENTUM BEHIND
 IT
 YOU OWN IT
 I DO NOT.
 BUT TWO WORDS, I'M SUCH A BIG
 F
 FAN, SATA.
 LEADERSHIP FROM THE CLOUD.
 I THINK MY KIDS KNOW THIS, THE
 CLOUD IS WHAT WE WILL BE TALKING
 ABOUT HERE.
 I LOVE THE TIGER WOODS
 REFERENCES KEEP COMING IN AS
 PEOPLE PUT UPGRADES ON SINCE
 TIGER WOODS WON THE MASTERS.
 THEY SAY IT'S ROARING THROUGH
 2019 LIKE TIGER ON THE 16th.
 REMEMBER, THE PAR 3, ROLLS DOWN
 THE LITTLE SLOPE, WITHIN A
 COUPLE OF FEET
 MAKES THE BIRDIE
 GOES UP BY TWO SHOTS
 I LOVE THE STOCK, AS I
 MENTIONED EARLIER, I BOUGHT
 OPTIONS LAST WEEK, CAUSE ON IT
 AND SOLD SOME BECAUSE THEY DID
 WELL IN THE SHORT PERIOD OF
 TIME
 HE'S DOING GREAT
 HE'S TURNED INTO A COMPLETE
 SUBSCRIPTION MODEL, FASCINATING,
 ATTACKING ALL OTHER PRODUCTS
 THEY DIDN'T HAVE IN THEIR
 QUIVER
 I THINK THERE'S MORE GROIJWTH TO
 COME.
 THE BEST STRATEGY AND STYLE
 OF MICROSOFT IS HIGH GROWTH
 STRATEGY WITHOUT THE HYPER
 VOLATILITY
 IF YOU OWN IT, WHICH I DO, IT'S
 BEEN VERY EASY TO OWN THIS STOCK
 FROM THE MID-'60s, WHICH IS
 WHERE I OWN IT FROM, AND OTHER
 PORTFOLIO MANAGERS
 YOU DO NOT HAVE THE HYPER
 VOLATILITY
 YOU HAVE A PHENOMENAL MANAGEMENT
 TEAM
 YOU HAVE A DIVERSIFIED BUSINESS
 THAT SHOWS ORGANIC GROWTH.
 YES, I CAN SEE IT AT 150
 AND WE'RE OFF TO THE RACES
 TALKING ABOUT THE TRILLION
 DOLLAR MARKET CAP.
 APPLE 960, MICROSOFT AROUND 940.
 THEY'RE BOTH HEADED THERE.
 YOU LOOK AT THIS AS A GREAT
 TURNAROUND STORY
 IS TURNAROUND THE RIGHT WORD
 I MEAN FROM -I'M CURIOUS HOW
 THE DESK VIEWS THIS.
 IT'S NOT LIKE THE COMPANY WAS
 DOING BAD.
 THE STOCK WAS SO STUCK IN THE
 MUD FOR SO LONG, THEY WERE SO
 TIED TO ONE PARTICULAR PART OF
 THE BUSINESS
 AND THROUGH NADELLA AND THE
 LEADERSHIP OF HIM AND HIS
 EXECUTIVE TEAM AND BEING NOW IN
 THE RIGHT PLACE, IS THAT A
 TURNAROUND
 I THINK IT'S A TYPICAL FACE
 OF FRESH EYES.
 NEW FOUNDER, FRESH EYES SAYING
 WHAT CAN WE DO HERE?
 WE WILL TAKE MICROSOFT, THEIR
 PRODUCTS, AND CONTINUE TO
 UPGRADE THE PRODUCT OUTLOOK AND
 WE CAN PUT IT ON A SUBSCRIPTION
 BASE RATHER THAN JUST SELLING A
 LICENSE FOR IT
 SO YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP GOING.
 WE CAN TAKE OTHER THINGS THAT
 THEY DO LIKE THE CLOUD WAS SEEN
 TO BE AN EASY ONE AND EXPAND
 THERE.
 THE CLOUD I MORE WORRY ABOUT
 BECAUSE IT'S A COMMODITY OF
 BUSINESS AND YOU SEE REAL
 PRICING.
 BUT THEY KEEP ADDING PRODUCTS,
 THEY KEEP ADDING FUNCTIONALITY,
 SO YOU HAVE TO GO AFTER IT TO
 MATCH THE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES
 AROUND YOU
 AND THAT'S KEY
 THAT'S THE FRESH EYES.
 JOSH?
 YEAH, I THINK --
 I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER.
 THE WHOLE COUNTRY OWNS IT
 IT'S LIKE THE SECOND BIGGEST
 STOCK IN THE WORLD
 IT'S IN EVERY INDEX.
 I DON'T HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL
 OVERWEIGHT TO IT, I WISH I DID
 BUT YOU CAN'T ON EVERYTHING.
 THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT, I THINK
 FRESH EYES
 THE WEE TURNAROUND WHEN OBAMA
 WAS RUNNING IT FROM WHEN HE TOOK
 OVER IN 2000 TO WHEN HE LEFT
 THAT'S NOT REALLY A TURNAROUND
 THE TAKEAWAY IS WHAT PRICE YOU
 PAID
 IF YOU BOUGHT IT IN 1999, 2000
 YOU PAID SEVEN TIMES EARNINGS
 FOR MICROSOFT HN TO GET DOWN TO
 12 TIMES EARNINGS.
 SO IT TRIPLED EARNINGS BUT THE
 MULTIPLE WAS SO HIGH IT ALMOST
 DIDN'T MATTER.
 THEY WERE DOING EVERYTHING THEY
 COULD THINK OF TO JUICE THE
 STOCK PRICE.
 THEY EVEN DID ONE OF THE BIGGEST
 ONE-TIME DIVIDENDS IN MARKET
 HISTORY AND THE STOCK YAWNED
 WHAT REALLY HAPPENED TO STEVE'S
 POINT, SOMEBODY HAD TO COME IN
 AND SAY WHAT ARE OUR TRADITIONAL
 STRENGTHS, HOW CAN WE KEEP THOSE
 AND PLAY TO THAT STRENGTH?
 BUT WHAT ARE ALL OF THE NEW
 THINGS WE SHOULD BE DOING?
 AND BALLMER IS ENTRENCHED.
 HE CAN'T UNDUE SOME OF THE
 PROJECTS THAT DIDN'T WORK.
 IT'S THE REASON WHY YOU DON'T
 LET A SURGEON FIX HIS OWN ERROR.
 YOU NEED A NEW SURGEON TO COME
 IN BECAUSE THE OTHER GUY WILL
 LOOK AT THE SCALP INSIDE OF YOU,
 NOT FIX THE PROBLEM.
 THERE ARE OTHER STORIES LIKE IT.
 I THINK DISNEY IS A GOOD
 PARALLEL
 STOCK COULD NOT GET OUT OF ITS
 WAY AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY
 NEED TO REINVENT THE ENTIRE
 THING.
 TO IGER'S CREDIT, HE DID NOT
 NEED TO BE REPLACED BUT A FEW
 YEARS IN THE TRENCHES TO GET TO
 THE NEXT LEVEL
 IN THE CASE OF MICROSOFT, THEY
 DID NEED A NEW GUY.
 THAT STOCK, BY THE WAY, WAS
 $116 WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT IT A
 COUPLE WEEKS AGO, TO $132 AND
 CHANGE.
 YEAH.
 EARNINGS ARE NOT GOING TO GROW
 TO THAT EXTENT
 IN FACT, THEY'RE GOING TO BURN A
 LOT OF MONEY BUILDING THIS HOUSE
 AND MARKETING IT AND DOING
 PROGRAMMING.
 THIS IS A RERATING
 THIS IS PEOPLE SAYING IF I'M
 PAYING 65% FOR NETFLIX, MAYBE
 DISNEY SHOULDN'T BE 15 TIMES
 IT'S ALSO SCARCITY.
 THERE'S SCARCITY OF STORIES LIKE
 THIS YOU CAN BUY, TAKE ADVANTAGE
 OF OVER THE TOP.
 AND THIS IS ONE.
 TO YOUR POINT, MICROSOFT WAS
 AT THE MERCY HOW MANY GRAY BOXES
 PEOPLE WERE BUYING FROM COMPAQ
 AND DELL
 THAT WAS THEIR BUSINESS.
 THEY HAD TO LIVE AND DIE ON THE
 PC SALE CYCLE.
 IS THIS THE UP CYCLE OR DOWN
 CYCLE?
 NOW THEY SELL DIRECT AND
 SUBSCRIPTION MODEL, THEY DON'T
 HAVE TO RELY ON PC SALES
 DISNEY IS NO LONGER RELIANT ON
 CABLE SYSTEMS.
 THEY HAVE THEIR OWN DESTINY IN
 THEIR OWN HANDS AND SELL OVER
 THE TOP.
 BALLMER WAS LOOKING
 EXTERNALLY TO BUY YAHOO! AND
 OTHER THINGS
 NADELLA IS LOOKING INTERNALLY SO
 YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIMIT ASSETS
 AND THAT'S WHAT CHANGED.
 COMING UP -A BIG WIN FOR
 TWO HALFTIME REGULARS.
 AND WE WILL GET AHEAD FOR THE
 BIGGEST NEED FOR EARNINGS YET.
 WE MENTIONED MORE THAN 100 S&P
 COMPANIES REPORTING NEXT WEEK.
  LERE ARE THE MARQUEE NAMES ON
 THATIST.
 WE WILL GO THROUGH THEM COMING

 HI, EVERYBODY, I'M BRIAN SULLIVAN IN FOR TELLY TODAY.
 WE WILL HAVE MORE ON THE IPO
 BONANZA, WITH PINTEREST AND
 ZOOM, STRONG DEBUT SO FAR.
 WHERE DO THEY GO FROM HERE
 WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR THE NEXT
 WAVE OF IPOs
 PLUS, WALL STREET BRUSHING
 ASIDE THE MUELLER REPORT FOR
 NOW.
 WILL IT DERAIL ANY ATTEMPTS
 GETTING NEW POLICY DWON P DONE
 IN D.C.?
 AND SHOULD THEY CHANGE THE
 LEGAL SMOKING AGE FROM 18 TO 21.
 THAT'S WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED.
 WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT.
 SEE YOU AT THE TOP OF THE HOUR.
 LOOK FORWARD TO IT, BRIAN
 SHARES OF UNITED RENTALS ARE
 HIGHER TODAY AND AFTER THE
 COMPANY BEAT ON THE TOP AND
 BOTTOM LINE, OUR STOCK, ONE OF
 OUR VERY OWN STEVE WEISS HAS
 BEEN BUYING THAT STOCK
 GOOD DAY FOR YOU, CONGRATS.
 THANKS.
 AND STOCKS SELL CHEAP.
 I WOULD LIKE TO BUY MORE IF IT
 PULLS BACK
 THE STORY HIRE IS THERE'S SOME
 CONCERN BECAUSE WEATHER WAS SO
 BAD IN THE FIRST QUARTER BUT THE
 CEO CAME OUT AND I MENTIONED ON
 AIR ABOUT A MONTH AGO SAYING
 LOOK, IT'S NOT BOTHERING US,
 WE'RE FINE
 SO YOU HAVE A CEO ABLE TO MANAGE
 THIS COMPANY EXTREMELY WELL,
 NUMBER ONE RENTAL COMPANY IN THE
 COUNTRY.
 THEY'RE TIED TO THE ECONOMIC
 SIGEL.
 THEY'RE GETTING PRICE.
 THEY'RE GETTING MORE
 CONSTRUCTION
 LOOK, I THINK YOU WANT TO OWN
 THIS
 THEY CAME OUT WITH THE PRICE
 STARTING $160, THIS IS ONLY 5.2
 TIMES, 20 EBID COMPANY.
 KUDOS TO THE LINKSTER ALSO,
 STEPHANIE LINK
 THIS IS A NAME SHE'S TALKED
 ABOUT A WHILE TOO.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS?
 I THINK IT'S GOOD
 I LIKE UNITED RENTALS.
 HONEYWELL WAS A GREAT QUARTER.
 YOU MENTIONED IT BEFORE.
 BUT IT'S A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF A
 COMPANY TELLING A STORY GE IS
 NOT TELLING.
 8% ORGANIC GROWTH.
 WHERE IS IT COMING FROM?
 GE IN THAT BUSINESS?
 I DON'T THINK SO
 FANTASTIC QUARTER FOR HONEYWELL.
 SPECIFIC TO THE COMPANY, STAY
 WITH IT.
 I THINK IT CONTINUES TO GO
 HIGHER AND HIGHER.
 LET'S GET AFTER EARNINGS NEXT
 WEEK
 BUSIEST WEEK FOR THE S&P,
 COCA-COLA, FACEBOOK, CAT,
 BOEING, AMAZON, EXXON -AND
 THAT'S JUST A SHORT LIST OF ALL
 OF THE NAMES COMING OUT NEXT
 WEEK
 ONES THAT MATTER
 WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW, I'M
 LOOKING FOR THE FACEBOOK, RIGHT?
 ALTHOUGH THE INTERESTING READ
 THROUGH THAT SAYS BOEING AND A
 CAT ARE GOING TO GIVE US NEXT
 WEEK ARE INTERESTING
 OUT OF MY OWN PORTFOLIO, I DON'T
 EXPECT ANYTHING BUT GREAT THINGS
 OUT OF THEM, AND TO HELP WITH
 THE FANG NAMES, IF YOU WILL.
 JOSH, ARE YOU GOING TO GET
 IT
 I THINK IT'S GOING TO SHIFT
 FROM USER GROWTH, WHICH AT 2
 BILLION IS IMPOSSIBLE.
 I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF SOME
 AROUND LIFTS START ASKING
 QUESTIONS WHETHER INSTAGRAM
 COULD SUSTAIN ANY MORE ADS
 SO NOW THERE'S GOING TO BE THAT
 CONVERSATION, LIKE HOW MUCH
 BETTER CAN IT GET GIVEN THE USER
 BASE, LET'S SAY THE USER BASE
 SLOWS DON IN TERMS OF HOW BIG IT
 GETS
 HOW ABOUT THE LITTLE BLUE
 BIRD.
 THEY HAVE GAINED TRACTION
 WITH ADVERTISERS THIS YEAR, THAT
 SEEMS TO BE THE TONE, A LOT OF
 OTHER PEOPLE ON WALL STREET SEEM
 TO BELIEVE THAT AS WELL.
 TWITTER IS LIKE THE ULTIMATE HIT
 OR MISS EVERY TIME, THEY HAVE AN
 INCREDIBLE QUARTER, THE NEXT
 QUARTER COMPLETELY BLOW YOU UP,
 THE QUARTER AFTER THAT, IT'S A
 CLEAN SLATE, NOTHING EVER
 HAPPENS MUCH THIS IS A TOUGH
 NAME TO OWN IN THE EARNINGS,
 THERE ARE VERY FEW OCCASIONS
 WHERE YOU REGRETTED NOT OWNING
 IT
 THERE WERE MANY OCCASIONS WHERE
 YOU WERE LIKE, I STUCK WITH IT
 I AM HEARING ADVERTISERS ARE
 HAPPY WITH TWITTER IN A WAY THEY
 HAVEN'T BEEN IN THE PAST
 A REFERENDUM ON THE GLOBAL
 ECONOMY?
 I'M NOT AS INTERESTED IN CAT
 AS I AM BOEING
 I BOUGHT SHARES YESTERDAY.
 IT'S AS NEGATIVE AS YOU CAN
 THINK ABOUT THIS QUARTER
 YOU KNOW, YOU'VE HAD AIRLINES
 COME OUT AND SAY, WE'RE NOT
 PUTTING THE MAX BACK ON UNTIL
 AUGUST
 LATER, CANCELLATIONS, WHAT I
 THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN IS,
 THEY'RE GOING TO BLEETH A SIGH
 OF RELIEF AFTER THE QUARTER, NO
 MATTER HOW BAD THE NEWS IS, IT'S
 TEMPORARY, AND THE STOCK SHOULD.
 IF THE MARKET'S GOING, THIS
 STOCK IS GOING WITH IT
 REGARDLESS
 IN TERMS OF CATERPILLAR.
 I BRING IT UP, BECAUSE REMEMBER
 THE HIGH WATER MARK COMMENTS OF
 MANY MONTHS AGO WHICH SORT OF
 UPSET THE FEELING?
 THIS COMPANY SEEMS TO PICK
 CEO'S THAT DON'T KNOW HOW TO
 COMMUNICATE WITH THE STREET.
 YOU HAD DOUG OEBERMEYER.
 WHO CAN MISS MORE QUARTERS OVER
 A 3 TO 5 YEAR PERIOD, IT'S
 ASTOUNDING
 SO, YEAH, IT'S IMPORTANT IN
 TERMS OF THE GROWTH AND SO
 FORTH, WE GOT SOME UNITED
 RENTALS.
 THE QUESTION IS, RENT TO OWN,
 THAT'S UNITED RENTALS.
 GASOLINE FUTURES ARE MAKING
 A BIG MOVE INTO THE WEEKEND.
 GASOLINE FUTURES SURGING INTO
 THE LONG WEEKEND
 NOW UP NEARLY 9%, LET'S BRING UP
 OUR TRADERS.
 WE'RE NOT EVEN AT PEAK DEMAND,
 SO WHAT'S BEHIND THE MOVE?
 I THINK IT'S LARGELY BECAUSE
 OF REFINING CAPACITY, THIS TIME
 OF YEAR, WE WOULD NORMALLY SEE
 REFINERIES WORKING IN OVER 90%
 RIGHT NOW.
 A COUPLE REASONS IS, UNPLANNED
 MAINTENANCE, THAT'S PART OF THE
 PROBLEM.
 THE TECHNICALS AND GRIZ IS GOING
 TO TALK TO THE LEVELS.
 THE CHART HAS BEEN FROM THE
 LOWER LEFT TO THE UPPER RIGHT,
 SINCE THE LOW IN STOCKS IN
 DECEMBER
 THE ONLY THING THAT THE BEARS
 CAN HOPE FOR IS THAT IT
 CONTINUES TO GET OVER BOUGHT
 RIGHT NOW, IT IS OVER BOUGHT
 WITH AN RSI OF 72.
 GOT IT.
 ANTHONY, HISTORICALLY THE PRICE
 OF GAS RISES
 IS THIS MOVE JUSTIFIED
 YES, IT IS.
 THERE'S REFINERY OUTAGES ACROSS
 THE COUNTRY AND THAT'S HAVING A
 RIPPLE EFFECT.
 AFFECTING PRICES ALL OVER THE
 U.S.
 THE GOOD THING, THE GOOD NEWS IS
 THAT WE'RE GOING TO HIT SOME
 RESISTANCE IN THE MARKET RIGHT
 NOW.
 $3 IS PRETTY STRONG RESISTANCE
 WE'RE NOT AT PEAK DEMAND
 I STILL EXPECT PRICES TO GO UP,
 BUT I DON'T EXPECT THEM TO GO UP
 THE RATE THEY HAVE BEEN OVER THE
 LAST FEW WEEKS
 GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU.
 COMING UP ON OUR LIVE SHOW,
 WE'RE JOINED BY JILL CARRIE
 HALL, WHO WILL TELL US WHY A

 I ALWAYS FOCUS ON HOW PEOPLE
 USE THE PRODUCT FIRST.
 WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON
 CONTINUING TO GROW GLOBALLY, AND
 OVER TIME, WE WANT PINTEREST TO
 BE A GREAT PLACE FOR BUSINESSES
 TO INSPIRE PEOPLE ON THE
 PLATFORM
 I WOULD FOCUS ON THOSE.
 WE HAVE ZOOM, YOU CAN LIVE
 ANYWHERE WITH ANY DEVICE, CAN
 YOU TALK WITH THE CUSTOMERS AND
 PARTNERS
 WE ENDED WITH THE ZOOM CEO,
 LET'S BEGIN OUR CONVERSATION
 THERE.
 JOSH BROWN
 ZOOM IS THAT MOST UNUSUAL BEAST,
 HE TWEETS, WHICH IS A PROFITABLE
 IPO COMING OUT OF THE TECH
 SECTOR
 YEAH.
 THIS IS A PROFITABLE COMPANY,
 HENCE THE GINORMOUS POP.
 THE PROFITS HELP, I ALSO
 THINK DOUBLING REVENUE
 AND THEN DOUBLING THAT FROM 18
 TO 19, THAT IS VERY SPECIAL.
 I ALSO THINK THE FACT THAT THIS
 IS ENTERPRISE TECH RERVERSUS
 CONSUMER SOCIAL MEDIA.
 YOU ARE.
 BUT THEY DON'T WANT THAT STIGMA
 OF BEING -EVERYONE WANTS TO BE
 ENTERPRISE TAG, SOFTWARE
 SERVICE.
 THAT'S WHAT ZOOM IS, WE HAVE
