 BOMANI: ON A STRING. PABLO: THE CONDUCTOR IS LIKE
 NO, YOU CANNOT OPERATION DUMBO
 DROP INTO MY TRAIN.
 NO, YOU CANNOT DO THAT.
 BO, YOU ARE A SUBWAY RIDER WITH
 MORE DILIGENCE THAN ME.
 DO YOU HAVE SYMPATHY FOR ANY OF
 THE CHARACTERS INVOLVED IN THIS
 SCENE?
 BOMANI: I DON'T JUST HAVE
 SYMPATHY FOR THE CONDUCTOR.
 I WANT THAT GUY TO GET
 PAPI: I LIKE CHEESE.
 DAN: WELCOME TO A SMOOTH AND
 SILKY "HIGHLY QUESTIONABLE."
 LOOK AT HIM.
 SO VERY SOUTH BEACH.
 CHRIS BOSH, WHAT DO YOU LIKE ON
 THE SHOW TODAY?
 CHRIS: I LIKE THAT I'M HERE.
 DAN: OKAY.
 NARCISSISM AT ITS FINEST.
 PAPI?
 PAPI: CHRIS BOSH, WHO WAS A
 BETTER PLAYER, PAUL PIERCE OR
 DUANE WADE?
 DAN: PAUL PIERCE IS A HALL OF
 FAME PLAYER, BUT DOESN'T SOUND
 LIKE IT.
 LISTEN TO THIS.
 WHO'S THE BETTER NBA PLAYER?
 THAT'S EASY.
 I CAN SAY THAT OFTEN THE BAT,
 THAT'S ME.
 IF YOU GIVE ME SHAQ, IF YOU GIVE
 ME LEBRON --
 WHAT ABOUT THREES?
 WE GOT THAT LATE.
 I'M TALKING ABOUT EARLY IN MY
 CAREER.
 WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A
 PERFECT TIME FOR YOU, PAUL?
 WHEN I WAS 24 YEARS OLD, GIVE
 ME SHAQ.
 I'M 25, GIVE ME LEBRON OR BOSH,
 I'M SITTING ON FOUR OR FIVE
 CHAMPIONSHIPS EASILY.
 WITH WHO?
 ANTOINE WALKER.
 COME ON, MAN.
 DAN: OH, HE WASN'T DONE, THOUGH.
 JALEN ROSE LET HIM HAVE IT.
 LISTEN THAT.
 SINCE DWYANE WADE ISN'T HERE
 TO 2010 HIS HONOR, IT'S MY TURN.
 NO BACKTRACK.
 HE'S BEEN AN ALL NBA FIRST TEAM
 TWICE.
 PAUL HASN'T DONE IT.
 HE MADE ALL NBA EIGHT TIMES TO
 YOUR FOUR.
 HE MADE ALL DEFENSIVE TEAM THREE
 TIMES TO YOUR ZERO.
 HE'S WON SCORING TITLE.
 YOU WEREN'T ABLE TO WIN THE
 SCORING TITLE.
 HE HAS THREE RINGS.
 YOU HAVE ONE RING.
 OOH, THREE IS BETTER THAN
 ONE.
 DAN: YOU DON'T WANT MY OPINION
 ON THIS, HIS OPINION ON THIS.
 HOW ABOUT YOU?
 CHRIS BOSH, WHAT WAS YOUR
 REACTION WHEN YOU HEARD PAUL
 PIERCE SAY HE WAS BETTER THAN
 DWYANE WADE?
 CHRIS: WE GOT TO STOP COMPARING
 GUYS.
 THAT'S HOW I FEEL.
 WE SHOULDN'T BE HAVING THESE
 CONVERSATIONS.
 HE WALK INTO THAT.
 THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING.
 PAUL PIERCE IS A COMPETITIVE
 GUY.
 HE'S WON CHAMPIONSHIPS, GOING TO
 THE HALL OF FAME.
 IF YOU ASK HIM WHO'S BETTER,
 HE'S GOING TO SAY HIMSELF.
 100%■■■■■RY TIME.
 BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S --
 DAN: BUTWRONG.
 EY, IT DOESN'T MATTER.
 AY DWYANEADE IS TOUGH
 TO BEAT.
 DAN: THAT'S L
 WE'LL# HEAT UP HIS OPINIONS
 AROUND HERE.
 DWYANE WADE IS TOUGH TO BEAT.
 PAPI: DO YOU KNOW WHO THESE TWO
 GUYS ARE BETTER THAN?
 DAN: WHO'S THAT?
 PAPI: LEBRON.
 I TELL YOU ONE THING, HE GOT
 MORE LOSSES IN THE FINALS, AND
 LEBRON GOT ALL THE LOSSES IN THE
 FINALS.
 THESE TWO GUYS DON'T GOT THAT
 MANY LOSSES IN THE FINALS, YOU
 KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
 HE'S WERE THE.
 LEBRON IS THE WORST OF THE
 THREE.
 YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
 DAN: IT'S THE ONLY THING YOU CAN
 DO.
 THAT'S THE PROPER RESPONSE TO
 THAT.
 THAT HURT HIS STOMACH.
 [LAUGHTER]
 PAPI: YOU GO AHEAD, COUNT THE
 LOSSES.
 DAN: I MEAN, THERE ARE MORE
 LOSSES.
 HE'S RIGHT.
 HE'S RIGHT ABOUT THE NUMBER OF
 LOSSES THIS THE FINALS.
 PAPI: WHAT'S THE POINT ABOUT
 GETTING TO THE FINALS?
 STAY HOME.
 DAN: ALL RIGHT, STAY HOME.
 PAPI: HE'S STAYING HOME THIS
 YEAR.
 DAN: HE'S NOT GOING TO LOSE IN
 THE FINALS THIS YEAR.
 PAPI: DOES KEVIN DURANT DESERVE>
 HEAT FOR JOINING THE WARRIORS?
 LISTEN.
 DAN: LISTEN TO THIS.
 RUN IT BACK, SAME TEAM.
 RIGHT?
 RUN IT BACK.
 DON'T CHANGE TEAMS.
 THAT'S HOW WE GREW UP, RIGHT?
 RUN IT BACK, SAME TEAM.
 YOU DON'T WANT TO CHANGE
 ANYTHING.
 WE FEEL WE'RE THE BETTER TEAM.
 WE JUST DIDN'T PLAY WELL ENOUGH,
 SO LET'S RUN IT BACK.
 THEY DIDN'T DO THAT.
 THEY WERE, LIKE, WE NEED TO
 RELOAD, GET OUR BIG BROTHER.
 OH, THANKS, GUYS.
 THAT'S FUN.
 DAN: SO OF COURSE KEVIN DURANT
 CAN'T LET THIS STAN, CHRIS BOSH,
 BECAUSE HE'S ALWAYS LURKING
 AROUND INSTAGRAM ACCOUNTS.
 EVERYBODY FROM THE STREETS NOW.
 YOU GOT RICHARD JEFFERSON.
 READ THAT FOR YOURSELF.
 CHRIS, WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS
 HERE?
 WHY IS KEVIN DURANT FIGHTING
 WITH EVERYBODY ON TWITTER?
 CHRIS: K.D., LEAVE IT ALONE, MY
 BROTHER.
 I DON'T KNOW.
 A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS GOING
 TO HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY.
 IF YOU'RE A FREE AGENT, YOU CAN
 GO WHERE YOU WANT TO GO.
 SO IF YOU WANT TO GO TO THE
 WARRIORS, GO TO THE WARRIORS.
 ONLY PROBLEM IS TAKING THE
 CRITICISM.
 SO FOR HIM IT'S JUST COME
 ABSURDLY INSANELY HIGH.
 DAN: THINGS DON'T ALWAYS GO THE
 WAY YOU EXPECT THEM TO.
 WHEN H HERE, HE THOUGHT
 HE'D BE THE LEADING SCORER ON
  MIAMI HEAT.
 THAT'S A THING HE THOUGHT.
 DIDN'T TAKE HIM LONG TO FIGURE
 OUT, WAIT A MINUTE, THESE GUYS
 HOLD ON TO THE BALL.
 PAPI: YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD DO
 IF I WERE DURANT?
 DAN: WHAT'S THAT, PAPI?
 PAPI: I'M GOING TO STA■÷■÷■÷■÷ ÷
 WARRIORS.
 CR■÷■÷■÷,÷FTER THAT I'LL÷■÷■÷■÷÷
 SHOW YOU THE FINGER WITH THE
 RING ON.
 ONE RING ON EACH THAN FINGER.
 SCREW UP, ALL RIGHT?
 THAT'S WHAT I WOULD DO RIGHT
 NOW.
 I TELL YOU WHAT, WHEN YOU WIN
 MORE CHAMPIONSHIPS AND YOU GET
 MORE RINGS, YOU CAN JAM THEM
 INTO THOSE FINGERS THAT YOU
 HAVE, YOU KNOW, KEEP JAMMING
 THEM IN THERE.
 YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
 KEEP JAPPING THEM, THAT'S RIGHT,
 THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S IT.
 DAN: I MEAN, YOU CAN DO THAT.
 PAPI: ARE YOU EXCITED TO WATCH
 GREAT DEFENSE TONIGHT?
 DAN: OH, GOD, NO.
 THIS IS THE WORST THANK YOU THAT
 I CAN HAVE IMAGINED HERE,
 BECAUSE I CAN'T TELL THE
 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BAD
 BASKETBALL AND GOOD DEFENSE.
 I KNOW THESE TWO TEAMS
 STATISTICALLY ARE VERY GOOD AT
 DEFENSE.
 I ALSO KNOW THEY SLOWED DOWN THE
 PACE INTO THE MUCK.
 I'M NOT HERE TO WATCH 22-
 BASKETBALL AT THE HALF.
 CHRIS BOSH, DO YOU APPRECIATE
 THE DEFENSIVE EFFORT?
 IT WAS AN UNDERRATED PARENT OF
 YOUR CHAMPIONSHIP TEAMS?
 YOU GUYS WERE GREAT AT DEFENSE.
 CHRIS: WELL, DEFENSE DOES WIN
 CHAMPIONSHIPS.
 IN TODAY'S GAME, I THINK IT'S
 INTERESTING TWO DEFENSIVE TEAMS
 ARE PLAYING IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP
 FOR THE NCAA.
 AS FAST AS THE GAME IS, AS MANY
 THREES AS WE'RE SHOOTING NOW,
 IT'S BECOME A■■■■■■■■UT SES■■
 WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT FOR THE
 NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP.
 DAN: I KNOW, AND I DON'T WANT TO
 WATCH IUSE IT LOOKS LIKE
 PEACH BASKET BASKETBALL.
 I LIKE ROCKET LAUNCHERS FROM
 HALF COURT.
 I'M NOT INTERESTED INASMUCH AS
 TWO ANONYMOUS TEAMS, TWO COME
 FROM NOWHERE TEAMS THAT PLAY A
 STYLE OF BASKETBALL THAT'S NOT
 APPETIZING.
 PAPI SOMETIMES■■NSE
 BEATS GOOD DEFENSE.
 DAN: OH, NO.
 WHAT'S HE GOING TO SHOW US HERE?
 OH, COME ON!
 COME ON!
 I TAUGHT WE WEREN'T DOING THIS
 ANYMORE TO HIM.
 I THOUGHT WE AGREED IN THE
 PRESHOW MEETING TODAY WE WERE
 GOING TO MAKE FUN OF ME, NOT
 HIM!
 PAPI: IS TRICKY NICKY ACTUALLY
 LOOKING OUT FOR THE BEST
 INTERESTS OF HIS PLAYERS WHEN HE
 TELLS THEM TO RETURN TO SCHOOL?
 DAN: HE MAKES A LOT GOOD POINTS
 HERE.
 IT COULD BE SELF-INTERESTED
 POINTS NONETHELESS THE TRUE.
 LISTEN TO THIS.
 WE HAVE FIFTH-ROUND GRADES,
 FREE AGENT GRADES, GOING OUT FOR
 THE DRAFT.
 YOU KNOW, THE PERSON THAT LOSES
 IN THAT IS THE PLAYER.
 YOU KNOW, YOU'RE A THIRD-ROUND
 DRAFT PICK, AND WE HAD ONE HERE
 LAST YEAR, I'M NOT MENTIONING
 NAMES, GOES AND STARTS FOR HIS
 TEAM, SO HE'S MAKING THIRD ROUND
 MONEY WHICH IS NOT THAT GREAT.
 BE THE FIRST GUY TAKEN AT HIS
 POSITION THIS YEAR PROBABLY AND
 MAKE $15 MILLION, $18 MILLION
 MORE.
 THE AGENT AND CLUB MAKE OUT.
 NOW YOU'VE GOT A GUY TO PLAY FOR
 THAT KIND OF MONEY FOR THREE
 YEARS.
 AWRIGHT?
 GET TO THE NEXT CONTRACT, 50% OF
 THESE GUYS ARE NEVER GETTING TO
 A NEXT CONTRACT.
 THAT DOESN'T MEAN ALL OF US GOT
 TO ONE EITHER.
 DAN: IT DOESN'T MEAN THEY WON'T
 GET HURT, WON'T GET MONEY, AND
 PLAYED ANOTHER YEAR FOR■ FREE AN
 WON'T GET THAT MONEY.
 I UNDERSTAND WHY SOMEONE WANTS
 TO GET THEIR MONEY, AND I ALSO
 UNDERSTAND WHY HE WANTS TO KEEP
 THEM IN SCHOOL FOR AS LONG AS HE
 WANTS.
 PAPI: I GOT A SIMPLE SOLUTION
 FOR TRICKY NICKY.
 DAN: WHAT'S THAT?
 PAPI: INCREASE THE SALARY FOR
 HIS PLAYERS, MAYBE THEY STAY
 FOUR OR FIVE MORE YEARS, THAT'S
 IT.
 DAN: NO, WE DON'T APOLOGIZE FOR
 THAT.


 DAN: COME ON, GONZO, APOLOGIZE
 TO NICK SABAN AND ALABAMA FOR
 THE HUNDREDTH TIME, MESA.
 PAPI: I'M SORRY TO TRICKY NICKY
 AND ALABAMA BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
 HOW MUCH THE PLAYERS ARE MAKING.
 MAYBE THEY'RE MAKING A LOT MONEY
 NOW.
 MAYBE THEY DON'T NEED A RAISE,
 YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
 MAYBE THEY DON'T NEED TO GO TO
 THE NFL, THAT THEY'RE HAPPY WITH
 THE MONEY THEY'RE MAKING.
 DAN: THAT'S NOT AN APOLOGY.
 THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE AN
 APOLOGY.
