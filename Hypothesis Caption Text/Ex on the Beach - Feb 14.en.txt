wanna miss tonight's twisted elimination, especially if you're a fan of revenge. 'Bout damn time! [Music] We represent our hood tonight [Music] [Music] Come on, we represent our hood for life... [Music][Music] Welcome back. Let's get you caught up. Morgan and Jay have worked through their issues, and are on the up and up. What's my favorite color today? Pink. Yup. But Corey seems to be the pain in their ass that won't go away. Chad and Nicole's relationship is moving to the next level, taking each other's measurements. Wow, you (bleep) it up. I had it. No, here. I got it. I'm gonna measure it for you, you (bleep) ding-a-ling. Janelle's still running hot after attacking Diandra for kissing her ex Darian. And Farrah's discovering her ripped-up posters, which was payback by Nurys for being kicked in the cooter. Oh, my God. Someone came up here and (bleep) up my signs. All right, so that's the (bleep) you started! Did she (bleep) do this? She might have did it, Farrah. Okay. Well, this is the best one. Did someone (bleep) up my-
- okay. All right. Don't attack all of my amazing, amazing signs... that my housemates spent their time on making for me. Did someone have an idea to (bleep) bend all my signs? ■ I (bleep) did! I did! I happily (bleep) did! I did, I did, I did, I did! Nurys did! She kicked me. She decided to put her hands on me, so I grabbed her free Farrah posters and I ripped them in half. Stop! No! You think I give a (bleep)? You think I give a (bleep)? No, no, no, no! Nurys, no! Diandra, Diandra! I know! If you wanna touch my stuff, your (bleep) gets a big (bleep) you down the toilet. Okay, touch my (bleep), bitch. Touch it, I dare you. somebody else's (bleep). I did. You ugly-ass bitch! Oh, I'm ugly, bitch? How much plastic surgery have you had to fix your face and your body? I haven't done not one thing to my body or my face and I'm (bleep) gorgeous, so (bleep) my (bleep), bitch. You (bleep) disgusting bitch. Sure, sure, I'll take your (bleep). I'll take your (bleep) and put it in the toilet. If she touches my (bleep), I'm letting you guys know, I'ma beat this bitch's ass. Go ahead, Farrah. Put that (bleep) in the toilet. o Here it goes. Here it (bleep) goes. Come on, sis. Here it goes. Put that (bleep) in the toilet. She (bleep) bent every one. She (bleep) your ex, sis! She bent! She bent! Disrespect me, disrespect my stuff, you will not be respected. And, um, karma's a bitch. Oh, (bleep)! She ripped her (bleep). Here we go. Here it goes. Here you go. Farrah's said she ripped it all up. If you argue with Farrah, she will kick you in the vagina and put your shoes in the toilet and flush. That's some pussy-ass (bleep). I've never done something so crazy like that. It's bad enough that Farrah already kicked me in the vagina. Now she's grabbing my sneakers and she flushes them down the toilet. I could've touched her makeup that was there, or any of her personal belongings, and I didn't, because I have some type of class. Don't threaten me! Don't trip me! Don't (bleep) attack me! Since fighting is a big fat no-no, Janelle, Nurys, and Farrah are sent to hotels for the night with a warning. Talk (bleep), get hit, bitch. I'll see you tomorrow 'cause we always keepin' positive things. I love you. Mwah! Love you too. You guys think the, like, Farrah-Nurys situation is gonna continue today or-
- Oh, yeah, 100%. She's in a very precarious legal situation right now. Don't be coming around kicking anyone. But, like, I just got-
- like, this is childish. Okay, but if you got kicked in the cooter, what would you (bleep) do? I'ma kick you back in the cooter. Farrah went back, and then the security guard was there. She tripped over his feet and Farrah fell on her ass. Well, good thing she's got those airbags back there. No, she-
- yeah. Did she bounce? My ex is definitely coming before yours. One of 'em. One of 'em is coming and it's gonna (bleep) up everything. I don't want Chad's ex coming into this house. I will literally ruin this girl's life if she thinks for one second that she has any upper hand on me when it comes to Chad. I will rip her to shreds. We still gotta have-
- we're still going to the sauna. I know. That's still a date. Exes coming in. ■es, exes. At the end of the day, we're just these, like, what? Skin blobs floating around on this planet that's going through space through a round of ball of fire? Like, and that's life, and then you die. You know, eventually. Thanks for the deep thoughts, Einstein. We to that point yet? Yeah. We can have sex really close to people? We are? Okay. Come here, Corey. We're gonna have sex on top of you. You're our first victim. Those guys are so cute together. I'm peanut butter and jealous of their relationship. I really don't have feelings for Sh And Morgan, she's kinda boo'd up with Jay. I'm peanut butter and jealous of their relationship. You know, hopefully I can findn and be a cute couple. Oh, my God! What relationships are gonna get messed up today? Ahh! Please not me. I'ma say Morgan. I'm feeling it. Don't wield that (bleep). Chad has not been to the beach yet. It has to be Chad. (bleep)! Oh, my tits look so good! (bleep)! (bleep). So who's the last person? Please not me. Please. (bleep)! (bleep)! Why? Aw, damn it. Oh, my God. Just give me a little bit of time before another one comes. Can I just enjoy my peace? Bring up some men. Bye, girls. Bye. Bye, Morgan. Be good. Good luck. (Morgan)I have so ms in this house. Like, Corey needs to go home. So I am worried. I feel like I have finally gotten to a good place with Jay, and I just-
- I don't want an ex to come and screw that up. Best-case scenario is that it's somebody else's ex, not mine, and I can just go back in the house and have fun with Chad, and not have anybody try interrupting my little honeymoon. How y'all feeling? Terrible. I'm clueless. You're clueless? For sure. I don't need a third, Romeo. I think me and Jay are on good terms finally. So Corey's not confusing things for you? Um, I just don't think it's gonna work between me and him. Nicole, how are things with you and Chad? We're good. I feel like you're gonna (bleep) it up though, so bring on the exes. By the end of this whole experience, some of you may find new love, rekindle with an old love, or just say (bleep) love. But the real question: Are you completely over your ex? It's time. No. Let's bring 'em out. (bleep). My ex coming in? Like, he doesn't need to be here. Just throw him back in the water. It's like, how much more can I take? I haven't cracked yet, but I feel like if an ex comes out of the water, I might reach my cracking point. [Music] Fun, everybody love a bomber, balls are great... [Music] Oh, that's not my ex! Yeah, that's not mine either. [Music] Go ahead, treat yourself... [Music][Music] My name is Monte, from Memphis, Tennessee, and you may know me from Big Brother: Over the Top. Being a southern gentleman is about treating a girl right. Opening the door for her, not cussing, acting a fool in front of her, but also smacking her ass as she walks through the door. Me and Morgan met in the Big Brother house. We dated for six months and then she decided she wants to move to L.A., so that kind of put a, you know, rut in the groove. I'm here to not only rekindle me and Morgan, but I know for a fact that Morgan is the one I wanna settle down with. And I'm at that point in my life where I'm ready. What's up, man? Doing good. What's going on, Monte? How do you like seeing Morgan over there? She looks pretty good, man. Stop. Yeah? Yeah. Why you here? Gotta get her back, man. Get her back? Yeah. He's trying to get you back! Great opportunity to take her back. It is, man. Once in a lifetime. Ugh! What happened between y'all two? I ended up moving to Los Angeles. It was too much of long distance got in the way and-
- So you left him hanging? It was too hard being so far apart. Seeing Monte brings back a lot of good memories. We don't really have any fights. You real flustered right now, like-
- Yeah, G because I'm alreG with two exes, You real flusand now you'reGg i. right now, like-
- But this connection seem genuine right here. Even from the other ones, I'm feeling something. I think there is a genuine connection, but it's difficult because I got some issues back at the house. Don't play with Jay's feelings. I think that this is something between Jay and Morgan that can potentially ruin them. We got some things to figure out. I'm done. (bleep), (bleep)! No, Morgan! (bleep)! Uh-oh! Guess what day it is? Guess what day it is! Huh...anybody? Julie! Ah come on, I know you can hear me. Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike... what day is it Mike? Ha ha ha ha! Leslie, guess what today is? It's Hump Day. Whoot Whoot! Ronny, how happy are folks who save hundred of dollars switching to GEICO? I'd say happier than a camel on Wednesday.

[SFX] Introducing new Hershey's Milk Chocolate e's Pieces Now in one bar u's Pieces So how you been? I've been good. It's been an experience, to say the least. Um, I'll go ahead and fill you in since Romeo told me I need to be honest. Yeah, shoot me straight. Don't lie to me. I feel like I'm an emotional wreck at all times in this house. It's like I'm the only person with three exes. Some people don't even have one ex and I'm dealing with three. Like, I need to get Corey out of this house, and he's honestly pretty boring. Jay came in the house. I kind of rekindled things with him. Then Corey came in, so it was kind of like... Double whammy. ...a weird messy love triangle. But I thought I had it figured out till you walked up on the beach. Me and Monte had a great relationship before this. It didn't end badly. My family loves him. He's unfortunately the exact kind of guy that my dad would want me to marry, which is terrifying. You're my girl. Everything happens for a reason. So I really think, you know, Jay might be cool, but, you know, you gotta remember back to what we had too. We could rekindle that even better. I don't know who this Jay guy is, but, uh, he's gonna have to run for his money, 'cause, uh, Monte's coming. Give me a fair shot. That's all I ask. Okay. And I promise you, you'll reconsider. [Music] Let's go [Music] [Music] It[Music] It's time to go, go, go, go, whoa [Music] [Music] Do you wanna, do you wanna go? [Music][Music] How you feeling though this morning? I'm cool. Like, the only thing I was actually, like, I was thinking about, like, last night, was, like, no one ever pulled her to the side and was like, Yo, I understand you're upset, but, like, how you're reacting, like, that's not okay. Depending on how Janelle comes back from the hotel, I'm hoping to see, uh, a new-
- a new person. Uh, the girl that I used to know. Here we go. Oh, (bleep)! Oh, Nicole! Sha! Chad, you're safe! So Nicole is back now and she doesn't have an ex, and I'm just like, Thank God I don't have to deal with that situation. So how did the guy look? Tell me. Does he look cute or whatever? I'm kind of scared for Jay. Why? He said he's here to get her back, and he's here for no other reason but to get her back. Oh, (bleep). Honestly, it should be called Morgan's Ex on the Beach. Like, how many exes do you have, girl? Like, just stop. All right, pull the chair, pull the chair, pull the chair. Hold on. Hey, Morgan. Take a seat. Let the man do the talking. Gah damn. This Monte character? (grunts) Damn! Ugh! Um, I will say this. All the boys you brought into the house are fine as (bleep). And-
- yes. So at least I have good taste. What are you here for? What are your intentions? What are my intentions? Are you here to be with her? ■÷ Are ■; to rekindle that fi? Hell yeah, man. I'm gonna rekindle the fire. What are you talking about? Okay, there we go. Oh, I'm gonna be just Mr. Tough Guy here to steal your girl. I'ma flirt with her in front of you and I'm gonna pretend like I'm not. Ha ha! I'm so cool! Clown. If things don't work out with Jay, are we allowed to take him into our relationship? You're allowed to take him right now if you want. We can share. Oh, God, it's so sweet it's making me sick. Let's see if everyone else can be so levelheaded as Janelle, Farrah, and Nurys return from their stay at the hotel. Baby, baby, baby! Hey! ç■■7■7's Janelle. Hey! Whoo! What's up? So I've had a night to cool down, relax. Going in the house, for me, it is stressful because I'm dealing with the fact that I really am, like, heartbroken for real. Diandra, can I talk to you? Yes. My main point to pull Diandra aside was to apologize to her and let her know that, hey, I know we've had our beefs in the past. Like, I know we personally don't care for each other, but the attack I made on her was not personal at all. So basically I just wanted to genuinely apologize for putting my hands on you. Like, my issues are with him. Like, I should conduct myself better just as a human being. You (bleep) kiss her?! You're gonna kiss her?! That is her ex. Oh, (bleep). Oh, you ain't tell me that. (bleep) you laughing, bitch?! Janelle! Janelle! Janelle! You (bleep)hole! So I apologize. I accept your apology. Um, I wasn't laughing at you. Like, I'm sorry. Like, when I get nervous, I'm like... But I literally-
- all I said, I looked back, like, this is crazy. And thankful that you came to apologize for putting your hands on me. No problem. Like, I meant it, but I shouldn't be hitting people. I saw Janelle go up to Diandra, apologize for the whole thing, argument they had, and just literally broke down. And you know what? It takes a grown person to apologize and to admit that. I accept your apology. With me, if someone says sorry and they genuinely mean it, ■ I will forgi With me,Will I forget?ys sorry and No. I'm not stupid. it, I will definitely keep my eyes up open, but the minute you say sorry, all right, clean slate. I'ma do a handshake. Okay. We'll take it slow. Yes. Okay. Okay, thank you. All right. Now that Janelle and Diandra are on the same page, the house vibes seem to be in a good place. Maybe Farrah and Nurys can squash their beef too? Hello, house. Hey, Farrah. Hello. There's another one. So I'm back today and I'm going in the house and I'm just staying away from literally everything, everyone, and (bleep) them. Aww. Have a drink. I'm back. I'm back. I'm extremely happy that Nurys came back here. She did nothing wrong, but I understand as to why she had to leave. But I am genuinely upset that Farrah is still here. I'm gonna go ahead and leave it in the fate of the Lord and He will take care of that. Karma's a bitch. Good. So if I started talking to another girl, she'd probably find out. Hey, can we talk? Hi, how are you? Sure. In private? Okay. I don't have to (bleep) apologize because I reacted like a normal human being, but better than a normal human being, 'cause a normal human being wouldn't have stopped (bleep) hitting her. Actually, a normal human being probably wouldn't kick someone in the vagina. I guess I just wanted to ask where your head was at yesterday. 'Cause I'm confused as to where all that animosity came from. All that, like-
- Okay, so I'm not confused. I'm very aware about what happened yesterday. When I come in to just hear what my friend's ex-boyfriend is saying, all I'm hearing is insults, um, from you about me, acting like you know me. I think-
- That all was brought up afterwards, so that's not what we're talking about. And continuation of that and that was-
- No, see, now you're trying to play victim. That's not what we're gonna do. So I'm not a victim. So I know you were just drinking. I'm not drinking. Okay. Okay. I'm wide awake. I have no patience for that. I apologized for you insulting me, you touching me. No. See, that's that-
- no, no. And I'm the bigger woman. Okay. Ha, okay. So I'm a real woman who knows what really happened. Okay, okay. You're out of control. Oh, my God. She's literally delusional. So stop. Get in control. This bitch is delusional, yo. Okay! Farrah does not care abo anye except for herself and s■■@@@@@. ■d■d■d■d■d■d■d■d■d■d■d■■d■■d■■d. Bitch, you're the trash. You kicked me in the vagina because I was having a conversation with someone. Like, (bleep) psychotic. Get ahold of yourself, out-of-control groupie. What's wrong? No, she's still lying and is a trash can. I know I'm a bigger person. She's a whore.

I know you're gonna say Farrah, but you gotta look at it from this point of view. Yeah, she causes a lot of (bleep), but y'all let her. Like, y'all let-

- y'all act like her words matter. You only got here yesterday. That's what I'm saying. Mm-hmm. You haven't seen the whole thing about her. She is nasty as a human being. Nasty. I haven't really got an opportunity to talk to Darian. He was hanging around Malcolm a lot, and everyone knows that Malcolm comes with Diandra and Nurys. You're not making it easy for me to forgive you, because I'm continuously watching you around people that I don't like. I just don't think it's fair! Morgan, you are much stronger than this, babe. Come on! Okay. You know what? I said this whole entire time I was not gonna reach my breaking point. And congratulations, Ex on the Beach. You officially broke me. What else can I do to screw up? I feel like I screw up everything! No. No, you don't. Just let her cry. She just needs to cry, honestly. Let it out. I think right now Morgan actually feels genuinely sorry and bad.

I know. One for me and one for you. Now that's a sandwich! Lay's. Make Life Flavorful. Welcome back. Before the break, the exes found out that they all had power for tomorrow's elimination, which is bad news for some of our misbehaved singles. You know, I tried so hard in this house to be positive and happy. 'Cause the last thing I wanted to do was come in this house and lose myself. And now I feel so lost. I know I don't have a say with the exes, but I want Corey out before Farrah. To me, he doesn't contribute anything. He has the personality of a (bleep) pet rock. And I feel like Jay's pissed with you just because, like-
- Why would he be pissed with me? I feel like he's pissed at you and her because-
- Not at me. She was kissing back. It wasn't like a-
- she said it was a snipe. It wasn't a snipe. It wasn't a snipe at all. When you're in this house, you kind of know that evI mean, yeah,onna be revshe could focus on Jay.,..■s But honestly, like, what's she gonna look at? You know what I'm saying? It's hard for me to deal with the house and all this and me and you haven't gotten anything, like, resolved. Resolved. That (bleep) pisses me off 'cause it's like I'm over here dying inside. Darian knows that I do not allow a man to not be accountable fowrongdanise thatt go it again. Like, I need you to repent to me like I'm Jesus. When are you gonna fight for me here instead of involving yourself in (bleep) that don't (bleep) matter? When the (bleep) are you gonna fight for me? You don't even know what you want. When we originally broke up, she left me, literally. But now I feel like she kind of wants the best of both worlds. The onlymatters is me can't strictly talk about me and you right now, then I will just go to bed. That's fine. Okay. Good-bye. Like, this is (bleep). That (bleep) again, man. Let it go. Are you good with us being done, yes or no? Of course not, Janelle. I feel like we're still up in the air. It could go left, it could go right. At the end of the day, Yeah,I'm my own man. know? I'm gonna make my own decisions. [Music] One light [Music] [Music] So co raise your head up to the sky [Music] [Music] Aye-aye-aye-aye [Music][Music] We good now? That is so cute. Look at you and your cute breakfast. ■■■■ up! and sausage. So you haven't got sausage in a while, so open up. That was a good one, huh? Mmm. Pretty good, huh? It's tricky. I really love it. I'm just gonna go eat up all my sausage. See you later. We both haven't got sausage in a long time. You know when you're hung over and you get ready and you don't even remember getting ready but you just kind of come to as you're looking good and you're like, Yeah? Yeah. It's nice. It's so weird that an OG might leave. Might? Is. So if I am really up for elimination, I'm not worried about it, but I'm prepared, and I'm G a pantsuit tonight. In all Farrah-ness, I don't really feel like I should be leaving. Punted her straight in the pooter. I don't think I did. What am I gonna do to a girl's crotch? The whole thing with Nazarian or whatever her name is-
- 3v3v3va Nazar-
- N-Na-
- Something with an N. Just keep thinking her name is like Nazarian. It's like my plastic surgeon. I really-
- I'd rather be thinking about that than whatever she's about, so... What's up, gangsta? What's going on? Talk to me. I'm just, like, drained emotionally. I just didn't wanna get to that point yesterday and I did, and now I feel like I, like, can't be myself. What do you want with us? I don't know. You don't trust me anymore. It's like-
- You honestly believe that I don't trust you at all? I don't know. I just wish you were more honest with me. I would prefer the truth. Not 10%, 50%, 90%. Give me the whole damn thing. Just wanna say sorry. I didn't wanna put you through all this. Do I still want affection and touch her all the time and hug and (bleep)? Hell yeah. So I'll give her a shot. I'll give her a chance again. But... I still care about you. It's like, are you happier with me here? Yeah, what are they gonna do? Send me a new blond? We know where Jay stands, but the rest of the exes are still making up their minds. I just wanna know where-
- what-
- like, where your heads are at and why you would-
- you know, like, who you guys wanna vote out and, like, why? The only singles on the chopping block are Corey and Farrah. Corey because Morgan wants him out. She doesn't feel that she can continue her relationship ay while he's here. And Farrah is on the chopping block. It's 'cause she kicked my girl in the vagina and she needs to (bleep) off. Morgan's like, Someone help me, please. But she's not actually physically getting attacked, and it's bull(bleep). You know I get your side, and I feel so bad for Morgan that she's gotten bull(bleep) after bull(bleep) after bull(bleep). But to be honest, she did not get this physically attacked. That's so (bleep) up that any of you guys are even deciding for even the slightest (bleep) bit. Seriously? I don't understand why people wanna get Corey out. Corey hasn't done anything. Faa crazy, delusional bitch. ■#■# She's the one that's the problem. It's the craziest thing you guy We're supposed to be exes and we're supposed to stick together, correct? Correct, and none of you guys had my back. It's the biggest bull(bleep) ever. Even though I know she hurt you, and, like, Farrah did do things wrong, everyone's done a couple things wrong, and at this point, like, it's like we're not all gonna come to one. I think we should all just vote what we think at this point. So I'm just gonna go ahead and crush Farrah just because I feel like Farrah, if you're gonna respect her, she'll respectight back. She treats all of us pretty good other than the people that she doesn't like, which is everyone for the most part. I shouldn't have to (bleep)-
- this should be easy. It shouldn't even be a question. I totally understand why you want her out. I wish y'all would just talk it out. But you don't even wanna talk to me, so... I thought she did try to talk to her. She did try to talk to Farrah, and Farrah just blew-
- I already know I'm the bigger person. I don't need to. I'm not going up to the bitch again. And yes, I will call her a bitch 'cause she's a bitch. Like, I really don't care. It sucks to see that people don't have my back. I haven't done anything to deserve that. HAVE YOU BEEN TOLD YOU CAN'T GET HIGH SPEED INTERNET WHERE YOU LIVE? WELL@>N WITH HUGHESNET GEN 5.

Now the singles get a taste their own medicine. One of you mother(bleep) is going home. ■You're gone, Well, I'm just gonna go ahead and crush Farrah just because I'm cool with her and I'm just gonna go ahead and not even deal with the whole Corey thi jusso■■cauwith aloodl with her and I'm just gonna go ahead I respe(sighs) Tonight, I am cutting Corey because I think that he came here with a mission to stir up feelings with Morgan. I think that's kind of passed, so... Honestly, I think that people are, like, trying to protect Morgan, but she's, like, you know, a little bitter at this point, I think, and she, like, wants to get me out now. I'm shocked that I would even be up to be eliminated, really. ? But as I am, I'm ready to defend myself. I'm here to stay. What up? What up, everybody? Looking good. Now, before we get started, I want to say something. There's any more confrontations that get physical,Beach. you will be sent home. We're all about love here, baby. All right, let's get down to business. Singles, we're gon' do things a little bit differently tonight. Earlier today, the exes voted for which single they wanted to crush or cut. The sing■Treceived ll be se Crush votes, like y'all know, cancels out cut votes. And if the vote results in a tie, the power will revert to the remaining singles. ■■■nd new l■ rekindle with a, or just say (bleep) love. By the end of your time here, we're gonna put you through the ultimate test. I've tried real hard to campaign to get Corey out of this house. Be able to a!■ Before we get to these votes,c. anybody wanna say anything? I would like to make a speech. Wow. Okay. A speech. Yeah. So it's a keep Farrah campaign. But does she forget we already voted? If I, Farrah, am here to stay, I pledge unlimited grocery shopping, live-in maid. Also lots more toilet paper, cleaner, and air spray. We gotta wrap it up in a second. Okay, all right. All who voted for me to be eliminated will be on trash duty and be shunned. ■Aaa■■ Honestly, in my heart of hearts, I don't want either Farrah or Corey to go. Farrah, we gotta take a seat right there. Thank you. All right. Whoo! Thank you. So funny. So funny. All right, all right, we gon' get back to it. Let's get started. Jozea. ■C■C■C You already know what it is. You good. Nothing's in there. No cut or no crush. Yes. You are safe, Jozea. Maya, Malcolm, Nicole, Cheyenne, Chad... ■t have nothing in your pineapple. Which means you are safe. We will got a lot of chips still out there. With that being said, Morgan, please step up to your pineapple. So how would you like the vogo tonight? I honestly would like Corey to go home. It's nothing against him, but I have three exes in the house. Three is enough. Are you ready? Yeah. You got a chip. But it's a crush. lause) Duh. But it's a crush. Have a seat. So, Janelle, you've been in the middle of a■8drama this week. Mm-hmm. Why don't you step up to your pineapple? Sure thing. See how this goes. Think you have a? Maybe. You never know. Let's get to it. Hold on. You got a chip. But it's a crush. Wow! I said actions, people. I said actions. You got a crush, which is a sign of love. (bleep). You better crush all this. You are safe. Have a sanelle. I'm just saying. Look at smile, man. You see that? Changes everything. He's trying to get his (bleep). We finally got a chip. YeahThank you.y is. Hey, Romeo.

Oh. I did. Oh, (bleep). Wow. Winning! So you gave the crush vote to Janelle? Yes, I did. What I respect about her is that she apologized ra. I could not do anything but respect that, so■2 I gave you that crush vote. is that she apologized ra. (applause) Darian ain't getting his (bleep). I am pissed because Darian was going to fully take the credit for that crush, but instead of wasting it on someone that you barely even know, it's like, put it towards me to show me that, like, you care. Corey, please step up to your pineapple. If I had to guess, you got some chips in there. Yeah. Let's get to it. First chip, cut. Got another chip... which is a cut. You got two cut votes, which means you're on the hot seat. Take a seat. I might be going home because of, like, her messiness, and it's just not that I would have to potentially go home. It'd be stupid for them to kick me out of the house 'cause I never cause drama. Like, I'm here to date, you know, maybe find love. So, next, Farrah. Please step up to your pineapple. You think you have I mean, I hope I havesh votes, some crush votes. cut votes?■ All right, you ready to get to it? Yeah. First one. I'm so over Farrah! You're giving everybody a hard time. You are a (bleep) person to everybody. You kicked one of my closest friends he house in her vagina. You need to get the (bleep) out. Previously on Ex on the Beach, ten incredibly single and available reality stars are looking for love while living with their exes. Jozea and his ex Rob had an emotional reunion at the beach. Are you about to cry? Aww! Farrah wouldn't let Nurys and Darian have a private conversation. I don't know why the (bleep) you're coming out here. So Farrah kicked her in the privates. Anto vote out Farrahet in the flipped elimination when the exes got the power to vote out one of the singles. after trying to get in the way Coreof Morgan and Jay's seat■ relationship. So now him and Farrah are both in fear of elimination, and one of them is going home. [Music] Who knew that the devil wore red? [Music] [Music] Silk dress, yeah, she always is a mess [Music] [Music] She more petty than the rest [Music] [Music] Heartbreaker... [Music][Music] Welcome back. It's elimination night, and this time, the exes are<<e by giving them a crush vote or a cut vote. Nelson put his crush in Janelle's pineapple as a way to thank her for taking the high road after her fight with Diandra. Darian tried to take credit for it until he got called out.
