 THE PERSON WHO WOULD BRING DOWN THIS PRESIDENCY.
 NOT FOR POLITICAL REASONS.
 BUT IF THERE'S ILLEGALITY IN THE
 WAY OF HIS INVESTIGATION HE'LL
 FIND IT, AND HE'LL PURSUE IT.
 WHAT'S ROBERT MUELLER GOES
 AFTER IS FACTS, THE LAW, AND
 JUSTICE.
 AND WHETHER IT'S DONALD TRUMP OR
 SOME OTHER INDIVIAL, IF THE
 FACTS LEAD TO THE PRESIDENT,
 ROBERT MUELLER WILL PURSUE THEM.
 AND IF THEY DON'T, HE WILL END
 HIS INVESTIGATION.
 HE DOESN'T GO AFTER ANYBODY.
 HE GOES AFTER THE TRUTH.
 ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE
 COMING OUT ABOUT THIS CASE ARE
 JUST MIND-BOGGLING.
 THINGS THAT YOU WOULD NEVER
 BELIEVE AND YOU WOULD NEVER DO.
 THE KILLER HAD BEEN WAITING,
 A YOUNG WIFE DEAD BUT IT DIDN'T
 STOP THERE.
 SOMEBODY CAME OUT FROM BEHIND
 THE TREES AND HE SHOT ME.
 WHAT IN THE WORLD IS GOING
 ON?
 THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO KNOW.
 HER HUSBAND HAD AN ALIBI AND
 SOMETHING ELSE, A LOVER.
 IT WAS SHOCKING.
 WOULD NEVER HAVE EXPECTED IT.
 AND AS POLICE GOT CLOSER TO
 THE TRUTH.
 HE SAYS I THINK I KNOW WHO
 DID IT.
 THE TRUTH GOT CLOSER TO HOME.
 HE JUST TOLD ME, HOLD ON,
 IT'S ABOUT TO GET A LOT MORE
 CRAZY.
 SECRETS ON HOT SPRINGS DRIVE.
 HELLO AND WELCOME TO DATELINE
 EXTRA.
 I'M CRAIG MELVIN.
 KATE PARSONS AND BECKY SEARS
 WERE BEST FRIENDS AND NEXT DOOR
 NEIGHBORS.
 THE TWO SHARED NEARLY
 EVERYTHING, THEN KAY WAS
 VICIOUSLY BEATEN IN HER OWN
 HOME.
 AS HER LOVED ONES REELED WITH
 GRIEF INVESTIGATORS DESCRIBED
 BEHIND THEIR FRIENDSHIP LAY A
 TALE OF INFIDELITY AND BETRAYAL.
 BUT DID DECEPTION LEAD TO
 MURDER?
 HERE'S DENNIS MURPHY.
 Reporter: YOU WON'T FIND
 MAYBERRY R.F.D. ON THE MAP.
 BUT IF CLOSE NEIGHBORS, GOOD
 SCHOOLS, AND JUST PLAIN, OLD
 CIVILITY IS WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING
 FOR IN A PLACE TO CALL HOME, YOU
 COULD DO WORSE THAN SETTLE IN
 GROVETOWN, GEORGIA.
 TAMARA BALDWIN HAS LIVED HERE
 FOR 14 YEARS.
 YOU SEE THE CHILDREN OUTSIDE
 PLAYING, HAVING A GOOD TIME.
 JUST A NICE, QUIET PLACE THAT
 YOU WANNA MOVE AND TAKE YOUR
 FAMILY TO.
 Reporter: THE WAY WE THINK
 AMERICA USED TO BE, AND SEEMS TO
 BE HARDER AND HARDER TO FIND,
 HUH?
 YEAH.
 THE ARMY'S FT. GORDON IS JUST
 DOWN THE ROAD AND A NUMBER OF
 THE CITY'S 12,000 RESIDENTS ARE
 ACTIVE OR RETIRED MILITARY.
 CRIME STATS CAN BE MEASURED IN
 STOLEN BICYCLES.
 GREAT PLACE TO RAISE A
 FAMILY.
 Reporter: HERE'S A VETERAN
 INVESTIGATOR FOR THE COUNTY.
 WHAT'S YOUR CRIME RATE?
 IT'S NOT THAT HIGH.
 WE DON'T HAVE TOO MUCH VIOLENT
 CRIME.
 Reporter: DOZENS OF HOMICIDES
 A YEAR, WOULD YOU SAY?
 NO, NOT AT ALL.
 WE MIGHT HAVE ONE A YEAR.
 Reporter: ONE A YEAR?
 YEAH.
 Reporter: AND IN MARCH, 2009,
 THEY DID HAVE ONE -A HOMICIDE.
 A BAD ONE THAT SENT NEIGHBORS
 SHOPPING FOR BURGLAR ALARMS AND
 MAYBE FRESH AMMO.
 YOU WONDER, "WHAT'S GOING ON?
 WHAT'S HAPPENING?"
 Reporter: SO MANY TERRIBLE
 THINGS HAPPENED SO QUICKLY.
 SO MANY TABOOS WERE BROKEN ON AN
 ANYWHERE SUBURBAN STREET THAT
 THE MIND REELED.
 WE WERE SO CONFUSED.
 WE JUST KEPT PRAYING FOR THE
 FAMILIES.
 THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD WAS
 SHOCKED.
 Reporter: IT BEGAN HERE WITH
 TWO HOUSES, TWO BEST FRIENDS ON
 A STREET CALLED HOT SPRINGS
 DRIVE IN GROVETOWN.
 KAY PARSONS HAD MOVED INTO THE
 NEIGHBORHOOD IN 2005.
 SHE WAS A DEVOTED WIFE TO HER
 HUSBAND, DAVID, WHO WORKED DOWN
 AT FT. GORDON.
 AND AN ACTIVE LITTLE LEAGUE MOM
 CHEERING ON HER 12-YEAR-OLD SON
 DEREK.
 TAMARA LIVED JUST DOWN THE
 STREET.
 KAY WAS A SWEETHEART.
 YOU NEVER SAW HER UPSET, NEVER
 SAW HER MAD, ALWAYS SMILING,
 JUST A JOY TO BE AROUND.
 WHAT KINDS OF THINGS DID SHE
 LIKE TO DO?
 WELL, MOSTLY ANYTHING DEALING
 WITH HER SON AND HER HUSBAND.
 SHE WAS VERY SUPPORTIVE, ALWAYS
 BEING WITH THEM.
 Reporter: NEXT DOOR TO KAY
 LIVED BECKY SEARS.
 BECKY HAD HER HANDS FULL, TOO.
 SHE AND HER HUSBAND TONY HAD
 FIVE KIDS, INCLUDING TWO OLDER
 SONS FROM BECKY'S FIRST
 MARRIAGE.
 TAMARA BALDWIN:
 SHE'S ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE
 WHO'S VERY OUTGOING, ONE OF
 THOSE, "HEY, HOW YOU DOING,"
 TYPE PEOPLE.
 Reporter: TAMARA GOT TO KNOW
 BOTH, BUT SAYS KAY AND BECKY
 REALLY HIT IT OFF.
 THEY WERE BEST FRIENDS.
 THEY WERE BASICALLY INSEPARABLE.
 AND THEY WERE TOGETHER
 24/7 ALMOST.
 Reporter: THE TWO NEIGHBORS
 BECAME PEAS IN A POD.
 THEY WORKED AT THE SAME PHYSICAL
 THERAPY CENTER CALLED
 HEALING HANDS.
 THEY'D GO ON VACATIONS WITH
 EACH OTHER.
 Reporter: JURGEN COWLING WAS
 THEIR BOSS.
 WHEN YOU THINK OF THEM BEING
 AROUND YOUR OFFICE, WHAT DO YOU
 SEE THEM DOING?
 WELL, WE ALL GET ALONG.
 AND KAY AND, YOU KNOW, YOU KNEW
 THEY WERE BEST FRIENDS, 'CAUSE
 THEY WERE CUTTING UP ON EACH
 OTHER.
 AND THEN THEY WOULD ALSO TELL
 STORIES ABOUT THEIR SONS'
 BASEBALL, ESPECIALLY DURING THE
 BASEBALL SEASONS, 'CAUSE THEY
 WERE BEST FRIENDS, THE SONS.
 Reporter: KAY AND BECKY EVEN
 JOINED WEIGHT WATCHERS TOGETHER.
 AND THE TWO OF THEM WERE PRETTY
 COMPETITIVE AT THE WEIGHT
 WATCHER THING, HUH?
 YES, YES.
 Reporter: WHO'S UP A POUND,
 WHO'S DOWN A POUND?
 YES.
 EVERY DAY.
 Reporter: AND ONE DAY IN
 MARCH, 2009, BEGAN LIKE ANY
 OTHER.
 KAY, THE LITTLE LEAGUE MOM, GOT
 UP TO TAKE DEREK TO SCHOOL, AND
 BECKY, THE MOTHER OF FIVE, LEFT
 HER HOUSE A FEW MINUTES LATER TO
 DROP OFF HER KIDS BEFORE HER
 WORK DAY BEGAN.
 ALL VERY ROUTINE.
 UNTIL 8:30 A.M., WHEN CONTRACTOR
 MITCH COZART SHOWED UP TO DO
 SOME MAINTENANCE WORK ON KAY'S
 BACK DOOR.
 YOU'RE COMING AROUND THE CORNER.
 YOU LIFT UP THE LATCH GATE.
 AND TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE.
 OKAY.
 WHEN I WALKED BACK INTO THE --
 INTO -WHERE THE BACK DOOR WAS,
 IT WAS -THE GLASS WAS BUSTED
 OUT.
 AND -I -I IMMEDIATELY KNEW
 THEY HAD BEEN BROKEN INTO.
 Reporter: DID YOU PUT YOUR
 HEAD INSIDE THE HOUSE AND LOOK
 AROUND OR CALL --
 ALL I DID --
 Reporter: -CALL OUT HER
 NAME.
 I JUST -I JUST STUCK MY
 HEAD JUST INSIDE JUST ENOUGH TO
 HOLLER OUT FOR HER.
 AND I -I DIDN'T GET NO
 RESPONSE.
 Reporter: HE TRIED CALLING
 KAY'S PHONE.
 NO ANSWER THERE EITHER.
 HE CAME BACK OUT FRONT AND
 NOTICED A YOUNG MAN SITTING ON A
 ROCK ACROSS THE STREET.
 HIS NAME WAS MICHAEL, THE OLDEST
 OF KAY'S FRIEND BECKY'S FIVE
 KIDS.
 MICHAEL HAD OVERHEARD THE
 CONTRACTOR TALKING ON THE PHONE.
 I WALKED UP TO HIM.
 AND I SAID, "HEY, DID YOU SAY
 SOMETHING ABOUT THIS HOUSE BEING
 BROKEN INTO?"
 AND HE WAS, LIKE, "YEAH."
 AND I WAS, LIKE, "WELL, MINE HAS
 BEEN, TOO."
 Reporter: SO NOW TWO BROAD
 DAYLIGHT BREAK-INS OF ACROSS THE
 FENCE NEIGHBORS.
 WAS THE THIEF STILL LURKING?
 I CARRY A FIREARM IN MY
 VEHICLE.
 SO -AND SO ACTUALLY I -I
 WENT OUT AND GOT ONE JUST IN
 CASE.
 YOU KNOW, THE -I MEAN, THE --
 SOMEBODY COULD RUN OUT OR
 WHATEVER.
 Reporter: HE CALLED 911.
 YEAH, THE BACK DOOR IS BROKE
 IN AND THE NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR'S
 DOOR IS BROKE IN.
 I'D CALLED THE OWNER, BUT SHE'S
 NOT HERE.
 AND I DON'T THINK -IF SHE'S
 GONE.
 I MEAN, I HOLLERED INTO THE
 DOOR.
 UH-HUH.
 AND I DIDN'T GET NO RESPONSE.
 YEAH, I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO
 IN.
 Reporter: THE CONTRACTOR
 FOLLOWED INSTRUCTIONS, AND
 WITHIN MINUTES, LAW ENFORCEMENT
 RESPONDED TO THE SCENE READY TO
 INVESTIGATE TWO POTENTIAL
 BURGLARIES RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO
 EACH OTHER.
 POLICE TAPED OFF THE AREA.
 NOW TAMARA'S NEIGHBORS WERE
 CALLING HER AT WORK, INCLUDING
 KAY'S HUSBAND DAVID.
 HE WAS TRAVELING ON BUSINESS.
 HE ASKED ME, "HAVE YOU SPOKEN
 TO KAY?"
 AND I'M, LIKE, "NO, NOT TODAY.
 I'M AT WORK."
 AND HE SAYS, "OKAY, I'M JUST
 TRYING TO GET IN TOUCH WITH KAY.
 I'M IN CALIFORNIA."
 Reporter: FIRST RESPONDERS AT
 THE SCENE ALERTED INVESTIGATOR
 JIMMY EDMUNDS WITH THE COLUMBIA
 COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE.
 IT'S VERY UNUSUAL TO HAVE --
 HAVE TWO HOUSES SIDE BY SIDE,
 YOU KNOW, HIT IT ONE TIME
 THAT'S, YOU KNOW, THAT SAME WAY.
 Reporter: SO ARE YOU
 THINKING, "WHERE'S THIS GUY
 GONNA GO NEXT?"
 CORRECT.
 I'M DEFINITELY THINKING,
 "WHERE'S HE AT?"
 Reporter: BUT AS EDMUNDS
 TURNED HIS ATTENTION TO THE
 BREAK-INS AT THESE TWO HOMES, HE
 AND HIS TEAM DISCOVERED
 SOMETHING UGLY.
 SHE WAS IN A POOL OF BLOOD.
 Reporter: THIS WASN'T GOING
 TO BE A SIMPLE BURGLARY.
 THIS WAS A VIOLENT ATTACK WITH A
 BLOODY TRAIL BETWEEN THE HOMES
 OF TWO BEST FRIENDS AND A FEMALE
 BODY LYING IN THE GARAGE.
 SHE WAS BEATEN SO SEVERELY
 YOU COULDN'T EVEN RECOGNIZE HER.
 Reporter: WHAT HAD HAPPENED
 ON HOT SPRINGS DRIVE?
 AND WHOSE SANCTUARY WAS ABOUT TO
 BE VIOLATED NEXT?
 A BADLY-INJURED VICTIM IN ONE
 HOUSE.
 INVESTIGATORS WONDER WAS
 SOMETHING WORSE WAITING FOR THEM
 NEXT DOOR?
 COMING UP --
 THE POINT OF ENTRY YOU COULD
 SEE THE BACK DOOR WAS THERE.
 WHEN SECRETS ON HOT SPRINGS
 DRIVE CONTINUES.
                 S THERE. WHEN SECRETS ON HOT SPRINGS
 DRIVE CONTINUES.

 That is definitely not for sale!

 Reporter: MARCH 25, 2009. JUST AFTER 9AM.
 SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES HAD RUSHED TO
 THIS QUIET RESIDENTIAL STREET IN
 GROVETOWN, GEORGIA TO
 INVESTIGATE NOT ONE, BUT TWO
 BURGLARIES.
 WORRIED ABOUT HER FRIENDS AND
 NEIGHBORS KAY AND BECKY,
 TAMARA BALDWIN LEFT WORK AND
 HEADED HOME TO WHAT SHOCKINGLY
 HAD BECOME A CRIME SCENE.
 DID YOU SEE LOTS OF VEHICLES
 AND UNIFORMS AND --
 A LOT OF POLICE CARS, THE
 ENTIRE CORNER WAS ALL TAPED OFF
 WITH CRIME TAPE.
 NOW YOU SEE TWO HOUSES THAT I
 HAVE TO PASS TO GET HOME, AND
 YOU WONDER WHAT'S GOIN' ON.
 Reporter: AND WHAT THE
 RESPONDERS FOUND INSIDE THESE
 HOMES WOULD PUT THIS
 NEIGHBORHOOD INTO FULL-ON PANIC
 MODE.
 INVESTIGATOR JIMMY EDMUNDS
 ENTERED THE HOME OF KAY, THE
 LITTLE LEAGUE MOM, THROUGH THAT
 SHATTERED GLASS BACK DOOR, THE
 ONE THE CONTRACTOR FIRST
 NOTICED.
 THEN EDMUNDS SAW IT: A TRAIL OF
 BLOOD.
 IMMEDIATELY, I COULD START
 SEEIN' SPOTS OF BLOOD ON THE
 FLOOR.
 I COULD SEE AN EMPTY COFFEE CUP
 THAT HAD SPILLED RIGHT THERE ON
 THE FLOOR FROM, FROM MCDONALD'S.
 THERE WAS A MCDONALD'S BAG
 ON -FOOD BAG ON THE FLOOR AND
 A PURSE.
 AND I STARTED SEEIN' SIGNS OF
 BLOOD ON -ON THE SOFA IN THE
 LIVING ROOM, ON THE -ON THE
 CARPET.
 AND THEN YOU GO INTO THE FOYER
 AREA, WHERE THERE WAS A LOT OF
 BLOOD ON THE WALLS, ON THE DOOR,
 ON THE FLOOR.
 SO THIS IS SUGGESTING A
 MOVING STRUGGLE.
 DEFINITELY.
 IT LOOKS LIKE THE HOMEOWNER CAME
 HOME AND SURPRISED A BURGLAR IN
 HER HOUSE, AND A STRUGGLE ENSUED
 WHERE SHE WAS BEATEN.
 Reporter: THE BLOODY PATH LED
 EDMUNDS FURTHER INTO THE HOUSE,
 TO A BLOODY HAND PRINT ON THE
 DOOR OUT TO THE PARSONS' GARAGE.
 AND YOU CAN TELL THERE WAS --
 THERE WAS MORE BEATING GOIN' ON
 IN THE GARAGE.
 THERE WAS BLOOD SPATTER ON THE
 WALLS.
 SO SHE WAS ALREADY BLEEDING
 BEFORE SHE GOT INTO THE GARAGE.
 Reporter: AND THAT'S WHERE
 THIS APPARENT STRUGGLE HAD
 ENDED.
 THE DEPUTIES FOUND 41-YEAR OLD
 KAY PARSONS LYING THERE ON THE
 FLOOR.
 HAD YOU EVER SEEN A SCENE
 LIKE THAT?
 NOTHING -NOTHING THAT
 DRASTIC, NO.
 SHE WAS BEATEN SO SEVERELY IN
 HER HEAD, IT WAS PRETTY BAD.
 Reporter: BUT AMAZINGLY, KAY
 WAS ALIVE.
 EMT'S HURRIED HER TO THE
 HOSPITAL, HER LIFE HANGING BY A
 THREAD.
 SHE STILL HAD A HEARTBEAT.
 BUT SHE WAS IN A VERY BAD
 WAY.
 VERY, VERY BAD WAY.
 Reporter: INVESTIGATOR
 EDMUNDS MADE THE CALL TO ALERT
 KAY'S HUSBAND.
 HE WAS IN LOS ANGELES FOR
 WORK.

 I WAS ABLE TO TALK TO HIM ON THE
 PHONE, LET HIM KNOW HE NEEDED TO
 COME BACK HERE AS QUICK AS
 SA
 POSSIBLE.
 SO HOW DID HE TAKE THAT NEWS?
 HE WAS -HE WAS PRETTY
 DEVASTATED.
 I TRIED NOT TO TELL HIM ON THE
 PHONE.
 I TRIED TO TELL HIM, YOU KNOW,
 "I NEED -YOU NEED TO COME
 BACK.
 THERE'S BEEN AN ACCIDENT," YOU
 KNOW?
 BUT HE -HE GUESSED PRETTY MUCH
 WHAT WAS GOING ON.
 Reporter: KAY'S HUSBAND DAVID
 BOOKED A FLIGHT HOME, AS
 INVESTIGATORS TURNED THEIR
 ATTENTION TO THE HOUSE NEXT
 DOOR.
 THAT'S WHERE KAY'S FRIEND BECKY
 THE MOTHER WITH FIVE KIDS LIVED.
 COULD THERE BE ANOTHER VICTIM
 THERE?
 THE POINT OF ENTRY WE COULD
 SEE WAS THE BACKDOOR ALSO THERE,
 AND WE FOUND SPOTS OF BLOOD ON
 THE BACK DOOR.
 Reporter: INSIDE, BECKY'S
 PLACE WAS RANSACKED, BUT, QUICK
 RELIEF, AS THEY LOOKED AROUND
 THERE WERE NO NEW VICTIMS.
 THE BLOOD SMEARS THEY'D NOTED
 APPEARED TO BE FROM THE CRIME
 SCENE NEXT DOOR.
 THAT MEANS YOU HAVE SOMEBODY
 THAT IS BRAVE ENOUGH, OR JUST --
 OR JUST CRUEL ENOUGH TO JUST --
 JUST BEAT THIS WOMAN SO
 SEVERELY, AND THEN IS GONNA GO
 NEXT DOOR AND COMMIT ANOTHER
 BURGLARY?
 Reporter: BECKY HAD BEEN AT
 WORK THAT MORNING WITH HER
 19-YEAR OLD SON CHRISTOPHER.
 THE TWO OF THEM RACED HOME TO
 THE SCENE AND MET UP WITH HER
 OLDER SON MICHAEL.
 THEY'RE BOTH THERE, SO YOUR
 MOTHER AND CHRISTOPHER ARE
 THERE?
 YEAH, THEY PULLED UP TOGETHER
 AT THE SAME TIME, WITH COLUMBIA
 COUNTY OFFICER.
 WE ALL WALK AROUND BACK TO KAY'S
 HOUSE, AND MY MOM, SHE SOUNDS
 VERY DISTRAUGHT.
 SHE'S -SHE'S SCREAMIN' KAY'S
 NAME.
 SHE SHOWS UP AT HER HOUSE
 WHILE YOU WERE ALL IN THE
 BACKYARD THERE?
 RIGHT.
 THEY SHOW UP ON SCENE AND -AND
 THEY'RE, WONDERING WHAT'S GOING
 ON, AND THEY'RE -THEY'RE
 PRETTY -PRETTY SHAKEN UP.
 Reporter: EVERYONE ELSE IN
 BECKY'S FAMILY WAS ACCOUNTED
 FOR, HER HUSBAND TONY, A LONG
 HAUL TRUCKER, WAS AWAY ON THE
 ROAD, HER THREE YOUNGER CHILDREN
 WERE FINE AT SCHOOL AND DAY
 CARE.
 THE INVESTIGATOR SAID BECKY'S
 FOCUS THEN TURNED TO KAY.
 UNDERSTANDABLY SHE WAS UPSET.
 YOU KNOW, SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
 HAPPENED TO HER NEIGHBOR.
 SHE JUST KNEW HER NEIGHBOR
 HAD -HAD LEFT IN AN AMBULANCE.
 Reporter: AND IN FACT,
 EDMUNDS SAYS, BECKY WAS LESS
 CONCERNED ABOUT THAT BURGLARY IN
 HER OWN HOME AND MORE ANXIOUS TO
 GET TO SEE HER NEIGHBOR.
 MICHELLE AMERSON IS A LONGTIME
 FRIEND OF BECKY WHO ALSO LIVED
 NEARBY.
 HER SISTER DROVE BECKY TO THE
 HOSPITAL.
 SHE GOT TO THE HOSPITAL, YOU
 KNOW, SHE WAS DEMANDING TO GET
 TO SEE HER FRIEND.
 SHE GO TO BEDSIDE FOR KAY,
 HUH?
 YEAH, SHE WANTED TO GET
 THERE.
 I SAID, "WHAT HOSPITAL DID
 THEY GO TO?"
 Reporter: NEWS OF THE ATTACK
 QUICKLY SPREAD TO ANOTHER CLOSE
 FRIEND OF KAY'S,
 SUZANNE FRAZIER.
 I HUNG UP THE PHONE AND I WAS
 SHAKIN', AND SO, I CALLED MY
 BOSS AND I SAID, "I GOTTA GO, I
 GOTTA GO."
 AND I LEFT.
 BROKE SOME -BROKE SOME
 LAWS, HUH?
 I RAN RED LIGHTS, I FLEW.
 I MEAN, I JUST WENT.
 Reporter: TAMARA RUSHED TO
 THE HOSPITAL TOO.
 DID YOU GET TO HER BEDSIDE
 OR --
 NO.
  -BE ABLE TO TAKE --
 NO.
  -A LOOK IN?
 I DID NOT.
 I -I JUST STAYED IN THE
 WAITING ROOM.
 THERE WERE A WHOLE LOTTA OTHER
 PEOPLE IN THE WAITING ROOM.
 BUT THE PROGNOSIS WAS VERY
 BAD, WASN'T IT?
 MACHINES WERE --
 YEAH.
  --KEEPING HER ALIVE AT THAT
 POINT EVEN, HUH?
 YES.
 Reporter: THE FRIENDS ALL
 KEPT AN EDGY VIGIL FOR NEWS
 ABOUT KAY'S CONDITION, WAITING
 FOR HER HUSBAND TO GET TO HER
 BEDSIDE.
 LIVES ALL CHANGED IN AN INSTANT.
 A HOME INVASION AND BURGLARY IN
 BROAD DAYLIGHT.
 A WOMAN FIGHTING FOR HER LIFE.
 AND NOW A PERPETRATOR ON THE
 LOOSE.
 YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU
 HAVE A GUY ON THE MOVE WHO COULD
 BE READY TO BUST INTO ANOTHER
 HOUSE ALONG HERE, RIGHT?
 EXACTLY, EXACTLY.
 WE DON'T KNOW IF WE HAD A MAD
 MAN ON THE LOOSE HERE, YOU KNOW?
 YOU SETTIN' UP SECURITY ON
 THESE STREETS?
 ON EVERY ONE OF THESE
 STREETS, WE'RE GOIN' TO EVERY
 ONE OF THESE HOUSES.
 WE'RE STOPPIN' ANYTHING THAT
 COMES IN OR COMES OUT OF THIS
 WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD, WE'RE
 TALKING TO EVERYBODY.
 IT'S YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD.
 AND --
 YEAH.
 THERE'S SOMEBODY OUT THERE
 WHO'S APPARENTLY A VERY VIOLENT
 PERSON.
 YES.
 YOU GOTTA BE TERRIBLY SCARED.
 I WAS.
 I'M THINKING THAT THERE'S
 SOMEONE WHO'S WALKIN' AROUND THE
 NEIGHBORHOOD WATCHING AND SEEING
 WHEN PEOPLE ARE LEAVIN' AND
 BASICALLY ATTACKING OR --
 Reporter: ON HOT SPRINGS
 DRIVE, THE INVESTIGATORS KNEW
 THEY HAD A SERIOUS CRIME ON
 THEIR HANDS, BUT AS THEY LEARNED
 MORE FROM THAT BLOODY SCENE, THE
 SHOCKWAVES ONLY KEPT ROLLING.
 COMING UP --
 HE SAID, "OH GOD.
 NO, NO, KAY."
 A HUSBAND RETURNS HOME TO
 TRAGEDY AND QUESTIONS.
 I JUST GOT A WEIRD FEELING.
 SOMETHING WASN'T RIGHT.
 WHEN SECRETS ON HOT SPRINGS
 DRIVE CONTINUES.
                 N SECRETS ON HOS DRIVE CONTINUES.
    -We're doing karaoke later,      and you're gonna sing.
    -Jamie, this is your house?
      -I know, it's not much,          but it's home.
           Right, kids?              -Kids?
           -Papa, Papa!            -[ Laughs ]
        -You didn't tell me     your friends were coming.
            -Oh, yeah.
  -This one is tiny like a child.
          -Yeah, she is.
        Oh, but seriously,    it's good to be surrounded
      by what matters most --
      a home and auto bundle         from Progressive.
           -Oh, sweetie,       please, play for us.
       -Oh, no, I couldn't.
             -Please.              -Okay.
      [ Singing in Spanish ]
             -Please.              -Okay.
        I love my babies,          love my boys.
    Since I'm a truck driver,      you know there's times
        that I'm gone for,   like, three weeks at a time.
  Even if I'm 3,000 miles away,
   I'm connected with my boys.
         Every day I can      video chat with them.
     I could be in the middle           of Wyoming.
    Even if I'm like waaay...            out here,
    I can still reach my kids.     Baby, you-you see me?
           Hey, Daddy!
          There for you      when it matters most.

          I switched from         a Ram to a Chevy.
         <i> See why people</i>     <i> are switching to Chevy.</i>
        We love our Chevy.
        Why did we switch?

 WELCOME BACK. IT WAS A GHASTLY CRIME.
 SUBURBAN MOM KAK PARSONS HAD
 BEEN SAVAGELY BEATEN DURING WHAT
 LOOKED LIKE A HEME INVASION
 LEAVING A BLOODY TRAIL.
 THE SUSPECTED BURGLAR THAN
 RANSACKED THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR.
 KAY WAS FIGHTING FOR HER LIFE IN
 THE HOSPITAL WHILE POLICE WERE
 SWEEPING THE HOUSE FOR CLUES.
 WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN THAT HOUSE,
 AND COULD THEY CATCH KAY'S
 ATTACKER BEFORE THEY STRUCK
 AGAIN?
 RETURNING TO OUR STORY HERE'S
 DENNIS MURPHY.
 Reporter: FRIENDS AND FAMILY
 GATHERED AT THE HOSPITAL KEEPING
 A VIGIL FOR KAY PARSONS, A
 SUBURBAN MOM WHO'D BEEN BRUTALLY
 BEATEN THAT MORNING IN A HOME
 INVASION.
 AND WHILE HER NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR
 BECKY'S HOME HAD BEEN
 BURGLARIZED TOO, BECKY DIDN'T
 SEEM TO CARE AS MUCH ABOUT THAT.
 GOOD FRIEND TAMARA SAYS THAT FOR
 BECKY, IT WAS ALL ABOUT GETTING
 TO SEE KAY.
 SHE CONTINUES TO ASK IF
 "WELL, CAN WE GO IN AND SEE HER?
 CAN WE GO IN AND SEE HER?"
 THEY TELL US NO.
 Reporter: EVENTUALLY, ONE OF
 KAY'S CLOSEST FRIENDS
 SUZANNE FRAZIER DID GET BACK TO
 HER BEDSIDE.
 COULD YOU RECOGNIZE HER IF
 YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT IT WAS HER?
 NOT REALLY, NOT REALLY.
 ALL PUFFED UP?
 VERY -VERY -FACE WAS VERY
 FULL.
 HEAD WRAPPED.
 SO I ASKED THE NURSE, SAID, "IS
 SHE BRAIN DEAD?"
 AND SHE DIDN'T ANSWER ME.
 Reporter: KAY WAS JUST
 CLINGING TO LIFE, SOME WRENCHING
 DECISIONS HAD TO BE MADE.
 AND DOCTORS WERE WAITING FOR
 GUIDANCE FROM HER HUSBAND DAVID,
 WHO ARRIVED BACK FROM A BUSINESS
 TRIP IN CALIFORNIA.
 HOW DID DAVID SEEM, THE
 HUSBAND?
 HE SEEMED VERY DISTRAUGHT.
 HE SEEMED VERY UPSET.
 YOU COULD HEAR HIM SCREAMIN'
 THROUGH THE DOUBLE DOORS.
 AND HE SAID, "OH, GOD, NO, NO,
 KAY."
 Reporter: INVESTIGATOR
 EDMUNDS SAW DAVID TOO.
 AND LAW ENFORCEMENT TENDS TO SEE
 THINGS A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY,
 ESPECIALLY WITH HUSBANDS.
 AT THE HOSPITAL, YOU MEET HIM
 IN PERSON, YOU SEE HIM?
 RIGHT.
 HIS WIFE'S ON LIFE SUPPORT, YOU
 KNOW.
 AND HE'S PRETTY DISTRAUGHT.
 BUT I JUST, STILL, I JUST GOT A
 WEIRD FEELING.
 SOMETHING WASN'T RIGHT.
 I COULDN'T TELL IF IT WAS,
 OVERBOARD OR IF IT WAS JUST -I
 COULDN'T PUT MY FINGER ON IT BUT
 THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS
 BOTHERING ME.
 Reporter: SO EVEN THOUGH THE
 HUSBAND HAD AN ALIBI, THAT OUT
 OF STATE BUSINESS TRIP.
 HE'S ON YOUR RADAR AND YOU
 BOTH KNOW THAT?
 YES.
 SO I'M WATCHING HIM PRETTY,
 PRETTY CLOSE.
 Reporter: BY THAT POINT
 EDMUNDS WAS TRYING TO DETERMINE
 EXACTLY WHAT HAD HAPPENED ON HOT
 SPRINGS DRIVE.
 HE HAD HIS TEAM TAKE PICTURES OF
 KAY, COLLECTING ANY PHYSICAL
 EVIDENCE FROM THAT CONFRONTATION
 IN THE HOUSE.
 AND THEY CAME UP WITH SOMETHING,
 A BIT OF HUMAN HAIR FOUND UNDER
 KAY'S FINGERNAILS.
 IT JUST MIGHT BE FROM HER
 ATTACKER.
 SHE HAD DEFENSE WOUNDS TO
 HER -TO HER ARMS, TO HER
 HANDS.
 SHE WAS -YOU KNOW, BRUISES
 EVERYWHERE, ALL OVER HER BODY.
 Reporter: ALL INDICATING
 SOMETHING ELSE, KAY HAD FOUGHT
 BACK.
 AND WHOEVER ASSAULTED HER HAD
 BEEN ON THE PROWL FOR SOMETHING.
 DEPUTIES SHOT VIDEO OF THE
 UPSTAIRS BEDROOM.
 IT HAD BEEN LOOTED, WITH JEWELRY
 AND OTHER VALUABLES MISSING.
 AND THEY FOUND WHAT SEEMED LIKE
 A SIMILAR M.O. IN BECKY'S HOUSE
 NEXT DOOR.
 THE MASTER BEDROOM IN THAT
 RESIDENCE HAD BEEN RANSACKED.
 SO BOTH HOUSES HAD BEEN
 TOSSED.
 BOTH HOUSES.
 Reporter: BECKY'S MOST
 VALUABLE NECKLACE AND RINGS,
 GONE.
 AND AS EDMUNDS KEPT EXAMINING
 THAT GRISLY SCENE IN THE
 PARSONS' GARAGE, HE DETERMINED
 HOW THE BURGLAR HAD ASSAULTED
 KAY, WITH A HAMMER, FOUND
 UNDERNEATH THE CAR, AND A
 BASEBALL BAT.
 SO THE WAY THE WEAPONS THE
 APPEARED JUST DESCRIBE A
 HORRENDOUS ATTACK?
 YES, IT APPEARED THAT THIS --
 THIS HAMMER, YOU KNOW, WAS USED
 IN IN, THERE WAS SO MUCH
 BLOOD, IT -IT SLIPPED OUTTA
 THE ATTACKER'S HAND.
 AND, YOU KNOW, THE BASEBALL BAT,
 WHICH WE WERE ABLE TO DETERMINE
 BELONGED AT THAT HOUSE, WAS --
 WAS A WEAPON OF OPPORTUNITY
 AFTER HE LOST THE FIRST WEAPON.
 Reporter: IT LOOKED LIKE THE
 LITTLE LEAGUE MOM WAS BEATEN
 WITH HER OWN SON DEREK'S
 BASEBALL BAT.
 IT REALLY TOUCHED MY SOUL
 KNOWING HOW MUCH DEREK LOVED
 BASEBALL.
 AND I'M, LIKE, "HOW IN THE WORLD
 COULD SOMEONE TAKE A BASEBALL
 BAT AND, YOU KNOW, BEAT HER?"
 Reporter: AN OLD-FASHIONED
 DRAGNET REMAINED DRAWN AROUND
 THE SUBDIVISION.
 FIND THE ATTACKER.
 YOU GOT A CRAZY GUY ON YOUR
 HANDS.
 YEAH, YEAH.
 I MEAN, HE -HE -HE BEAT THAT
 WOMAN SEVERELY, AND WE NEED TO
 FIND WHO IT WAS AND WHERE HE WAS
 AND -AND GET HIM OFF THE
 STREET.
 Reporter: SOME RESIDENTS
 MENTIONED A MYSTERIOUS FIGURE
 THEY HAD SEEN RECENTLY.
 WE HEARD ABOUT A GUY THAT --
 THAT -SUPPOSEDLY A HOMELESS
 GUY THAT WAS LIVIN' IN THE WOODS
 AROUND THERE SOMEWHERE.
 Reporter: SO THE INVESTIGATOR
 DISPATCHED SOME DEPUTIES TO
 CHECK OUT THE AREA JUST A FEW
 HUNDRED FEET FROM KAY'S HOUSE.
 WE CHECKED THE WOODS.
 WE DIDN'T SEE ANY SIGNS OF
 ANYBODY LIVIN' THERE, ANYTHING
 OF THAT NATURE. AND WE REALLY
 COULDN'T PROVE OR DISPROVE THERE
 WAS ANYBODY THAT WAS LIVIN' IN
 THE WOODS THERE.
 Reporter: SO A POTENTIAL
 LEAD, DASHED.
 BUT INVESTIGATORS HAD ANOTHER.
 UNLIKELY AS IT MAY SEEM, TINY
 GROVETOWN, GEORGIA HAS A FEW
 'USUAL SUSPECTS,' INCLUDING A
 YOUNG MAN WHO LIVED JUST AROUND
 THE CORNER FROM KAY PARSONS'
 HOME.
 WE LOOK AT OUR NEIGHBORHOOD
 AND SEE WHO'S LIVIN' AROUND
 THERE.
 AND WE, YOU KNOW, WE HAD A
 FREQUENT FLYER IN THERE THAT --
 A WHO?
 A FREQUENT FLYER, YOU KNOW.
 THAT -THAT'S SOMEBODY THAT WE
 DEAL WITH ALL THE TIME.
 YOU KNOW, THAT -THAT COMMIT
 THE SAME TYPE OF CRIMES, YOU
 KNOW.
 WE KNEW THIS GUY.
 WE -WE'VE ARRESTED HIM SEVERAL
 TIMES FOR BURGLARIES.
 AND HE LIVES CLOSE BY IN THE
 AREA.
 SO IF A COMPUTER'S MISSING OR
 A PIECE OF JEWELRY'S GONE
 ASTRAY?
 IF THERE'S CARS BROKEN
 INTO --
 YOU GO TO YOUR FREQUENT FLYER
 AND ASK HIM WHAT HE KNOWS ABOUT
 IT, HUH?
 IF HE'S CLOSE BY, WE -WE
 DEFINITELY TALK TO HIM.
 SO IN THIS CASE, ON THAT DAY,
 YOU DO THAT, HUH?
 WE DO.
 BUT WE WERE -WE WERE ABLE TO
 QUICKLY RULE HIM OUT.
 HE -HE HAD AN ALIBI.
 THERE WAS NO WAY HE COULD BE
 THERE.
 Reporter: THEN FROM THE
 HOSPITAL, THE NEWS EVERYONE
 FEARED AND EXPECTED.
 DOCTORS DETERMINED KAY'S
 INJURIES WERE TOO SEVERE FOR HER
 TO MAKE IT.
 THE FAMILY DECIDED TO TAKE HER
 OFF LIFE SUPPORT.
 KAY PARSONS, DEVOTED WIFE TO
 DAVID, LOVING MOTHER TO DEREK,
 WAS GONE.
 AND SO THEN THEY LET ME KNOW
 THAT SHE HAD PASSED AWAY.
 YOU LOST YOUR FRIEND, KAY.
 YES.
 YEP.
 A BEATING DEATH, A BREAK-IN.
 YES.
 HOW HORRIBLE IS THIS FOR YOU,
 SUZANNE?
 ONE OF THE WORST DAYS OF MY
 LIFE.
 I DIDN'T EXPECT IT.
 41 YEARS OLD.
 I MEAN, YOU CAN SEE SOMEBODY
 DYING OF CANCER OR, YOU KNOW, IN
 A CAR WRECK OR SOMETHING LIKE
 THAT, BUT TO BE BEATEN BEYOND
 ANYTHING.
 DID YOU GO BACK?
 YEAH.
 YEAH.
 YOU SAID GOODBYE TO KAY?
 AS MUCH AS I COULD.
 Reporter: NOW THE STAKES
 QUICKLY BECAME MUCH HIGHER FOR
 THIS INVESTIGATION.
 KAY PARSONS HAD BEEN MURDERED.
 AND EDMUNDS STARTED THINKING
 THIS KILLER MIGHT JUST BE
 SOMEONE WHO KNEW BOTH WOMEN,
 BECKY AND KAY.
 SOMEONE WHO HAD BEEN RIGHT THERE
 AT THE SCENE OF THE CRIME.
 COMING UP --
 POLICE TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT
 BECKY'S SON MICHAEL.
 THEY'RE NOT SEEING THE NEXT
 DOOR BOY SITTING ON A ROCK
 ACROSS THE STREET.
 AND THAT MADE ME SUSPICIOUS.
 HE DISCOVERS HIS MOTHER'S
 HOUSE BROKEN INTO.
 HE'S ON THE SCENE WHEN WE GET
 THERE.
 SO THAT RAISED A LOT OF RED
 FLAGS.
 WHEN SECRETS ON HOT SPRINGS
 DRIVE CONTINUES.
                 FLAGS. WHEN SECRETS ON HOT SPRINGS
 DRIVE CONTINUES.
     All money managers might          seem the same,
   but some give their clients    cookie cutter portfolios.
    Fisher Investments tailors            portfolios
     to your goals and needs.
  Some only call when they have        something to sell.
    Fisher calls regularly so        you stay informed.
   And while some advisors are    happy to earn commissions
   whether you do well or not.     Fisher Investments fees
  are structured so we do better       when you do better.
      Maybe that's why most          of our clients
 come from other money managers.
   Fisher Investments. Clearly     better money management.
    If Old Spice Sweat Defense    helps keep me feeling dry,
          how will they       know I worked hard?
  I've gotta make stuff harder.

       There, that's hard.
            Termites,     feasting on homes 24/7.
        We're on the move.
              Roger.
      Hey Rick, all good?
      Oh yeah, we're good.
           We're good.
   Termites never stop trying to              get in,
  we never stop working to keep            them out.

 WITH YOUR TOP STORIES. AXIOS REPORTS THAT PRESIDENT
 TRUMP WADED INTO CONTROVERSY
 DURING A SPEECH FOR RNC DONORS
 AT MAR-A-LAGO ON FRIDAY.
 THREE PEOPLE THE PRESIDENT
 CLAIMED SAID DEMOCRATS QUOTE
 SAID DEMOCRATS HATE JEWISH
 PEOPLE.
 THIS WAS IN RESPONSE TO
 ANTI-SEMITIC CLAIMS FROM
 CONGRESSWOMAN OMAR.
 157 PEOPLE WERE KILLED
 ABOARD AN ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES
 FLIGHT.
 BACK TO DATELINE.
 WELCOME BACK TO DATELINE EXTRA.
 I'M CRAIG MELVIN.
 INVESTIGATORS LOOKED INTO
 REPORTS OF A MYSTERIOUS STRANGER
 LIVING IN THE WOODS NEARBY AND
 TALKED TO A LOCAL KNOWN FOR
 COMMITTING SIMILAR STYLE
 BREAK-INS.
 BUT THOSE LEADS WENT NOWHERE, SO
 DETECTIVES TURNED THEIR FOCUS IN
 A NEW DIRECTION.
 WAS IT POSSIBLE THE KILLER WAS
 SOMEONE THEY HAD ALREADY MET?
 HERE AGAIN IS DENNIS MURPHY.
 Reporter: INVESTIGATORS IN
 GROVETOWN, GEORGIA NOW HAD A
 MURDER CASE ON THEIR HANDS.
 KAY PARSONS HAD BEEN ASSAULTED
 AND KILLED IN A HOME INVASION.
 AND THE HOUSE OF HER GOOD FRIEND
 BECKY NEXT DOOR HAD BEEN
 RANSACKED TOO.
 IS YOUR DOOR TO DOOR, YOUR
 CANVASSING, COMING UP WITH
 ANYTHING?
 NO.
 NOBODY -NOBODY'S SEEN ANYBODY,
 YOU KNOW, OUT OF THE ORDINARY IN
 THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
 Reporter: SO THEY TURNED TO
 THE FIRST PERSON IN THE
 NEIGHBORHOOD TO NOTICE SOMETHING
 WAS WRONG -THE CONTRACTOR
 WHO'D ALERTED 911 -FIRST MAN
 ON THE SCENE.
 INVESTIGATORS HAD TO WONDER WHY
 HE WAS REALLY THERE.
 AT THIS POINT -EVERYBODY'S
 A SUSPECT, YOU KNOW?
 YOU KNOW, AND LOGICALLY HE'S THE
 FIRST ONE.
 Reporter: EDMUNDS BROUGHT HIM
 DOWN TO THE SUBSTATION FOR
 QUESTIONING, AND THEY WENT
 THROUGH THE STORY HE HAD TOLD AT
 THE SCENE.
 IT WAS AN -AND I WALKED
 DOWN TO THE HALL AND I SAID,
 "HEY, IS ANYBODY IN THERE?"
 AND -ANYWAY -I DIDN'T HEAR
 NOTHIN'.
 Reporter: BUT YOU ALSO HAVE
 TO ASK HIM IF THAT'S REALLY WHAT
 HAPPENED.
 YES.
 Reporter: I MEAN, HE'S THE
 GUY WHO DISCOVERS THIS VIOLENT
 CRIMINAL ACT, AND YOU WONDER IF
 HE KNOWS MORE THAN HE'S SAYING.
 OH, DEFINITELY.
 Reporter: THEY PRESSED HIM TO
 FIND OUT MORE ABOUT JUST WHAT
 WORK HE WAS TO DO THERE, AND
 WHETHER HE HAD WORKED FOR KAY
 PARSONS BEFORE.
 DID YOU HAVE THE KEY -HAVE
 THE DOOR OPEN TO THE HOUSE?
 TO DO THE WORK?
 WELL, WE -WE -WAS MOSTLY
 OUTSIDE.
 THE LONELIEST TIME THAT WE WAS
 REALLY ON THE INSIDE IS WHEN SHE
 CALLED ME UP AND SAID, I NEED A
 LITTLE BIT FIXED ON THE INSIDE.
 Reporter: YOU HAD THE BAD
 LUCK OF BEIN' THE PERSON TO FIND
 THIS.
 YEAH.
 YEAH.

 Reporter: SO, THAT PUT YOU ON
 THE LIST ALSO, MITCH, OF --
 SURE.
 SURE, YEAH --
 Reporter: PEOPLE THEY WANNA
 GET A FULL STORY FROM.
 EXACTLY.
 Reporter: MAYBE WITH SOME
 SHARP QUESTIONS, HUH?
 YEAH, EXACTLY.
 I -I KNEW BETTER TO WALK IN
 THAT HOUSE, YOU KNOW?
 BECAUSE I DID NOT WANT
 ANYTHING -MY FINGERPRINTS
 ANYWHERE IN THAT HOUSE.
 BECAUSE -I JUST, YOU KNOW,
 WATCHED ENOUGH TV TO KNOW
 BETTER.
 Reporter: WHAT'D YOU --
 WHAT'D YOU SEE IN HIM IN TERMS
 OF DEMEANOR?
 HE SEEMED PRETTY GENUINE TO
 ME.
 HE WAS PRETTY SHAKEN UP.
 Reporter: SO INVESTIGATORS
 KNOCKED THE CONTRACTOR OFF THEIR
 LIST BUT IN HIS INTERVIEW HE
 HELPED POINT THEM TO SOMEONE
 ELSE THAT BOY ON THE ROCK.
 THEN I SEEN THAT BOY SITTIN'
 THE NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR SITTIN'
 DOWN ON A ROCK ACROSS THE
 STREET.
 AND -THAT MADE ME KINDA
 SUSPICIOUS RIGHT THERE, 'CAUSE I
 BE -I SAID -I SAID, "I
 WONDER IF THIS GUY'S A LOOKOUT."
 RIGHT?
 I MEAN, HE MIGHT BE STILL -YOU
 KNOW, SOMETHIN' IS GOIN' ON
 HERE.
 Reporter: MICHAEL, BECKY'S
 22 YEAR OLD SON FROM NEXT DOOR.
 REMEMBER, HE WAS ALSO ON THE
 SCENE THAT MORNING WHEN DEPUTIES
 ARRIVED.
 A NEIGHBOR AND FAMILIAR FACE TO
 KAY, THE VICTIM.
 THAT GOT EDMUNDS THINKING.
 I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, IF SHE
 CAME HOME AND SURPRISED THIS
 BURGLAR AND SHE KNEW WHO THIS
 BURGLAR WAS, HE COULDN'T LET HER
 GET AWAY.
 Reporter: YOU CAN ALMOST SEE
 THAT LITTLE MOVIE PLAY OUT, THE
 MOTIVATION, WHAT HAPPENED.
 EXACTLY, EXACTLY.
 SO WE STARTED LOOKIN' AT MICHAEL
 PRETTY HARD.
 Reporter: MICHAEL TOLD THEM
 HE'D GOTTEN THERE AROUND
 8;30 THAT MORNING ONLY TO FIND
 HIS HOUSE HAD BEEN BURGLARIZED
 AND HE'D PROMPTLY CALLED HIS
 MOM.
 BUT HE HADN'T CALLED THE POLICE,
 WHICH SEEMED A BIT STRANGE TO
 INVESTIGATORS.
 WHAT'S MORE --
 THERE WAS NO FORCED ENTRY TO
 THAT RESIDENCE.
 Reporter: THERE WASN'T?
 THERE WAS NO FORCED ENTRY.
 Reporter: THAT WAS ODD TOO,
 AND THEY WERE ABOUT TO LEARN A
 LOT MORE ABOUT MICHAEL.
 HE WAS BECKY'S OLDEST SON.
 HE AND HIS BROTHER CHRIS WERE
 FROM A PRIOR MARRIAGE.
 AND MICHAEL CAME WITH A HISTORY
 OF TROUBLE, MOSTLY DRUGS.
 SO, THAT'S GOTTA MAKE YOUR NOSE
 TWITCH A LITTLE BIT.
 MOST DEFINITELY.
 HE'S ON THE SCENE WHEN WE GET
 THERE.
 HE'S HAD A LOTTA PROBLEMS IN THE
 PAST WITH -WITH -WITH DRUGS.
 SO THAT RAISED A LOTTA RED
 FLAGS.
 Reporter: OPPORTUNITY TO GET
 QUICK CASH?
 MOST DEFINITELY.
 DRUG HABIT?
 MAKE A BUY?
 YOU KNOW, THEY GOTTA GET
 MONEY.
 AND THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT
 IS -IS BURGLARIES, YOU KNOW?
 GET THE QUICK CASH.
 Reporter: DID YOU HAVE
 TROUBLE WITH DRUGS AT THE TIME?
 I WON'T SAY TROUBLE, BUT IT
 WAS --
 Reporter: YOU WERE A REGULAR
 CUSTOMER, HUH?
 I MEAN, IT WAS A SOCIAL
 THING.
 WE'D BE -BEING DUMB AND YOUNG,
 THAT'S ALL.
 Reporter: SMOKIN' WEED, OR
 HARDER STUFF, MICHAEL?
 AH, SMOKIN' WEED AND A LITTLE
 HARDER STUFF, PILLS, THINGS LIKE
 THAT.
 Reporter: THIS IS METHADONE?
 YEAH.
 UH-HUH.
 YES, SIR.
 Reporter: WITH MICHAEL'S
 PRESENCE ON THE SCENE, AND DRUGS
 NOW IN THE EQUATION, EDMUNDS'
 TEAM BROUGHT HIM DOWN TO THEIR
 SUBSTATION FOR QUESTIONING.
 NOW, I'M GONNA BE POINT-BLANK
 WITH YA, IF YOU KNEW ANYTHING
 ABOUT THIS YOU WOULD TELL ME
 RIGHT?
 ABSOLUTELY.
 WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU
 TOOK SOME METHADONE?
 TODAY.
 TODAY?
 UH-HUH.
 Reporter: SO MICHAEL HAD USED
 METHADONE ON THE MORNING OF KAY
 PARSONS' MURDER.
 NOW INVESTIGATORS WANTED TO KNOW
 MORE ABOUT WHERE EXACTLY HE WAS
 WHEN THE ASSAULT HAPPENED.
 MICHAEL SAID HIS MOM BECKY HAD
 DROPPED HIM OFF AT A JOBSITE
 JUST BEFORE 7AM TO DO SOME HOUSE
 PAINTING.
 WHEN DID YA TELL YOUR MOM YOU
 HAD THIS PAINT JOB?
 WHEN DID YOU TELL HER YOU
 WERE --
 TOLD HER A LITTLE WHILE AGO.
 THIS MORNIN'.
 Reporter: BUT HERE'S THE
 THING.
 HE DIDN'T DO ANY HOUSE PAINTING
 THAT DAY.
 AND HE INITIALLY LIED TO HIS MOM
 AND INVESTIGATORS ABOUT WORKING.
 AND THE WHOLE REASON YOU LIED
 TO US WAS BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T
 WANT YOUR MOM TO FIND OUT THAT
 YOU DIDN'T REALLY HAVE A JOB?
 YES, SIR.
 THAT JUST THAT BLOWS MY MIND.
 Reporter: AND THERE WAS
 SOMETHING ELSE THAT REALLY
 TROUBLED INVESTIGATORS.
 IF MICHAEL WAS THE ATTACKER, HE
 HAD CLEANED HIMSELF UP BEFORE
 DEPUTIES GOT THERE.
 HE HAD NO BLOOD ON HIS CLOTHES
 OR VISIBLE WOUNDS.
 BUT HE DID HAVE SOMETHING ELSE.
 I ASKED HIM TO LET ME SEE THE
 BOTTOM OF HIS SHOES.
 AND AS HE LIFTED HIS SHOES UP, I
 SAW SMALL PIECES OF GLASS STUCK
 IN THE BOTTOM OF HIS TENNIS
 SHOES.
 AND THAT GLASS WAS THE SAME TYPE
 OF GLASS FROM THE BACK DOOR AT
 KAY PARSONS' HOUSE.
 Reporter: IN THE
 INTERROGATION ROOM MICHAEL
 COULDN'T EXPLAIN HOW THE GLASS
 FROM THE MURDER SCENE GOT THERE.
 AS FAR AS GLASS THAT WAS
 FOUND IN YOUR SHOES, HOW CAN YOU
 EXPLAIN THAT?
 GLASS IN MY SHOES?
 UH-HUH.
 I GUESS -I DON'T KNOW.
 MAYBE -I GUESS I DON'T KNOW.
 I REALLY DON'T KNOW.
 Reporter: SO, WHAT'S HE DOIN'
 WITH THAT GLASS UNDER FOOT, HUH?
 THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW.
 THAT'S WHAT I WANNA KNOW.
 Reporter: INVESTIGATORS
 TALKED TO MICHAEL'S BROTHER
 CHRIS THE SON WHO'D ARRIVED AT
 THE SCENE LATER WITH THEIR
 MOTHER BECKY.
 CHRIS SEEMED TO HAVE HIS LIFE
 TOGETHER IN A WAY THAT MICHAEL
 DIDN'T HE HAD A JOB EVEN HIS OWN
 HOUSE.
 THAT MORNING HE WAS HELPING HIS
 MOM AT THE THERAPY CENTER WHERE
 SHE WORKED.
 YOUR MOM PICKS YOU UP ABOUT
 WHAT TIME?
 I GOT UP AT 7:00, BRUSHED MY
 TEETH.
 SHE -SHE PULLED UP 7:10.
 THEN YOU GO TO WORK WITH HER?
 YES.
 Reporter: THEN THEY ASKED HIM
 ABOUT MICHAEL.
 CHRIS SAID HE KNEW HIS BROTHER
 TOOK DRUGS BUT HE SAID MICHAEL
 WOULDN'T HAVE KILLED ANYONE.
 DO YOU THINK YOUR BROTHER DID
 THIS? OR DO YOU THINK SOMEBODY?
 ABSOLUTELY NOT.
 I DON'T THINK MY BROTHER HAS IT
 IN HIS HEART.
 I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
 THAT -THAT -THAT AT THIS
 POINT, BROTHERLY LOVE IS NOT
 OUTWEIGHIN' COMMON SENSE.
 WELL --
 BECAUSE I JUST SAW SOME STUFF
 IN YOUR BROTHER JUST TALKIN' TO
 HIM FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES.
 AND I'M SITTIN' THERE GOIN',
 "WHAT?"
 PEOPLE GET ON METHADONE.
 THEY DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY.
 AND THEY NOT WORKIN'.
 WELL --
 HOW THEY GONNA GET MONEY?
 I -I -I AGREE ON THAT.
 WELL, OUT OF EVERYBODY THAT
 YOUR BROTHER HANGS AROUND
 WITH --
 WHO WOULD BE THE MOST LIKELY
 TO DO SOMETHIN' --
 YES, UH-HUH.
 YEAH, YEAH.
 LIKE THAT?
 YOU MIGHT NEED TO GET A BIGGER
 PIECE OF PAPER.
 BECAUSE OF THOSE DRUGS, MAN.
 I'D GO FOR SEVENTEEN HOURS.
 Reporter: SO MICHAEL'S
 BROTHER CONFIRMED THE TROUBLED
 YOUNG MAN RAN WITH A SHADY
 CROWD.
 INVESTIGATORS WERE ALL EARS.
 Reporter: DOES HIS
 ASSOCIATION WITH THE HOUSE, HIS
 BACK STORY, MAKE HIM A PERSON OF
 INTEREST TO YOU?
 HE'S DEFINITELY A PERSON OF
 INTEREST.
 Reporter: THE DEPUTIES KEPT
 MICHAEL AT THE STATION FOR
 NEARLY THREE HOURS BUT THEY
 DIDN'T HOLD HIM THAT DAY.
 HE GAVE THEM A NUMBER FOR HIS
 ALIBI WITNESS THAT FRIEND HE'D
 GONE TO SEE THAT MORNING.
 WOULD HE VOUCH FOR MICHAEL?
 SOON ANOTHER MYSTERY IS
 REVEALED AND ONCE AGAIN MICHAEL
 JUMPS TO THE TOP OF THE
 INVESTIGATORS' LIST.
 COMING UP --
 WE HAD SOME BLANK CHECKS IN
 ONE OF OUR OFFICES THAT
 DISAPPEARED.
 IT WASN'T LOOKING REAL GOOD
 FOR HIM.
 THINGS STARTED PILING MUP SFWLCH
 A AND NEW THEORY OF THE CRIME.
 WE DIDN'T KNOW IF THEY WERE
 IN THIS TOGETHER OR WHAT.
 WHEN SECRETS ON HOT SPRINGS
 DRIVE CONTINUES.
                 WHAT WHEN SECRETS ON HOT SPRINGS
 DRIVE CONTINUES.
              Woman:    This is your wake-up call.
   If you have moderate to   severe rheumatoid arthritis,
       month after month,       the clock is ticking
  on irreversible joint damage.
    Ongoing pain and stiffness
   are signs of joint erosion.
 HUMIRA can help stop the clock.
     Prescribed for 15 years,
    HUMIRA targets and blocks    a source of inflammation
         that contributes         to joint pain
     and irreversible damage.
   VO:<i> HUMIRA can lower your</i>  <i> ability to fight infections.</i>
      <i> Serious and sometimes</i>      <i> fatal infections</i>
     <i> including tuberculosis,</i>
     <i> and cancers, including</i>     <i> lymphoma, have happened,</i>
    <i> as have blood, liver, and</i>    <i> nervous system problems,</i>
   <i> serious allergic reactions,</i>
      <i> and new or worsening</i>         <i> heart failure.</i>
        <i> Tell your doctor</i>     <i> if you've been to areas</i>
     <i> where certain fungal</i>     <i> infections are common,</i>
      <i> and if you've had TB,</i>          <i> hepatitis B,</i>
    <i> are prone to infections,</i>
       <i> or have flu-like</i>       <i> symptoms or sores.</i>
       <i> Don't start HUMIRA</i>    <i> if you have an infection.</i>
              Woman:       Help stop the clock
     on further irreversible          joint damage.
   Talk to your rheumatologist.
      Right here. Right now.
             HUMIRA.
 Reporter: SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES WERE NOW ZEROING IN ON
 MICHAEL BOWERS AS A PERSON OF
 INTEREST IN THE MURDER OF
 KAY PARSONS, HIS MOTHER'S BEST
 FRIEND.
 WITH THE GLASS IN HIS SHOE,
 HIM BEING THE ONE SHOWING UP AT
 THE HOUSE, FINDING THE BURGLARY
 AND HIS PAST HISTORY OF DRUGS.
 AND YOU KNOW, DRUGS AND
 BURGLARIES GO HAND IN HAND.
 Reporter: INVESTIGATORS
 BELIEVED THAT KAY WAS BEATEN AT
 HER HOME IN A NARROW WINDOW OF
 TIME BETWEEN 7:10AM AND 7:20AM
 THAT MORNING.
 BUT MICHAEL SAID HE DIDN'T
 ARRIVE AT THE SCENE UNTIL 8:30.
 AND SAID HE HAD AN ALIBI FOR THE
 TIME BEFORE THAT.
 HE'D BEEN HANGING OUT, HE SAID,
 WITH A FRIEND NAMED ANTHONY.
 Reporter: WHAT'S THE STORY HE
 TELLS YOU ABOUT THAT DAY?
 WE PULL -WE PULL ANTHONY IN
 AND WE -WE INTERVIEW HIM
 AND -AND ANTHONY'S, HE'S A
 CHARACTER.
 HE -HE'S PRETTY LIVELY.
 HE'S VERY TALKATIVE.
 HE HADN'T HAD TIME TO TALK TO
 MICHAEL.
 WE KNEW MICHAEL HADN'T TALKED TO
 HIM.
 Reporter: SO YOU GOT TWO
 UNVARNISHED STORIES, THIS MIGHT
 WORK OUT. THEY HAVEN'T HAD A
 CHANCE TO COMPARE NOTES.
 EXACTLY.
 WHAT TIME MICHAEL GET TO YOUR
 HOUSE?
 ROUGHLY.
 YOU AWAKE, SLEEP, WHAT?
 I WAS UP.
 I WAS UP.
 WELL, I WAS LAYING BACK DOWN.
 I WAS LAID DOWN ON THE COUCH,
 GETTING READY TO GO BACK TO
 SLEEP.
 I DIDN'T EXPECT HIM THAT EARLY.
 BUT --
 BUT YOU WERE EXPECTING HIM?
 YEAH.
 HE SAID HE WAS GONNA COME OVER.
 HOW LONG WAS HE THERE?
 TILL -FROM WHEN HE GOT
 THERE, WHICH WAS ROUGHLY
 6:45 TILL 8:27 ON THE DOT.
 THEY WERE PRETTY CONSISTENT.
 YOU KNOW, ANTHONY WAS -HIS --
 HIS TIME WAS PRETTY CONSISTENT
 WITH -WITH MICHAEL'S.
 BUT WE STILL, YOU KNOW, WE -WE
 DIDN'T KNOW IF THEY WERE IN THIS
 TOGETHER OR -OR WHAT.
 ANGEL WAS ON.
 THAT'S WHAT I WATCH IN THE
 MORNING.
 AND SOME --
 YOU WATCH -YOU WATCH THE
 EPISODE OF ANGEL WEDNESDAY
 MORNING?
 THAT HOUR?
 TELL ME WHAT YOU --
 NO, ACTUALLY, I TALKED TO
 MICHAEL FOR PRETTY MUCH THE
 ENTIRE HOUR.
 BUT ANGEL WAS ON THE BOOB TUBE.
 Reporter: AS HE SAT IN THE
 INTERVIEW ROOM, INVESTIGATORS
 DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF THIS
 TALKATIVE CHARACTER.
 SO THEY HOOKED ANTHONY UP TO A
 POLYGRAPH MACHINE.
 AND ASKED HIM AGAIN WHERE HE AND
 MICHAEL WERE THAT MORNING.
 YOU DIDN'T EVEN COME CLOSE TO
 PASSING THAT POLYGRAPH.
 I'M SORRY.
 BUT I'M NOT LYING ABOUT IT.
 I TOLD HIM I'D TAKE ANOTHER ONE.
 I MEAN I'M, IF I WAS LYING, WHY
 THE HELL WOULD I HAVE SAID I'D
 TAKE IT?
 WELL, STRANGER THINGS HAVE
 HAPPENED.
 I'M SURE.
 YEAH.
 WELL, I'M TELLING THE TRUTH.
 SO IT IS WHAT IT IS.
 I MEAN I -I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO
 TELL YOU, SIR.
 BUT YOU CAN -I'LL GIVE YOU
 WHATEVER YOU WANT, YOU KNOW,
 BLOOD.
 THEY ALREADY TOOK MY MOUTH,
 SO --
 YEAH.
 BUT I DIDN'T DO ANY OF THIS,
 MAN.
 Reporter: ANTHONY REPEATED
 OVER AND OVER THAT HE HAD
 NOTHING TO DO WITH KAY PARSONS'
 MURDER.
 DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HER.
 DUDE, I'M TRYING TO BE AS
 STRAIGHT UP WITH YOU GUYS AS
 POSSIBLE.
 I MEAN --
 WELL, AND THAT -AND THAT'S
 WHAT I WANT.
 THAT'S WHAT I WANT.
 YES, SIR.
 I'M -I'M NOT GONNA LIE ABOUT
 IT.
 I WANT YOU TO CATCH THE GUY.
 I JUST -I DON'T WANT YOU
 LOOKING AT ME LIKE I DID THE
 [ BLEEP ].
 'CAUSE I AIN'T -DUDE, I AIN'T
 REAL COOL WITH YOU.
 I DON'T THINK IT'S A REALLY --
 YOU KNOW, IF YOU OR ME OR -OR
 SOME GUY GOT HURT, THAT'S ONE
 THING.
 YOU KNOW?
 BUT NOT A LADY.
 YOU KNOW?
 NOT SOMEBODY'S MOM.
 Reporter: AND HE STARTED TO
 PUT THE FINGER MORE ON MICHAEL.
 HE KNOWS SOMETHING.
 WELL, I DON'T BUT I DON'T
 RIGHTLY KNOW.
 WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
 WHAT DOES HE KNOW?
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE KNOWS.
 DUDE, LOOK, YOU'RE NOT CATCHING
 ME UP IN SOMETHING.
 HE KNOWS SOMETHING.
 WHAT DOES HE --
 HE SAW SOMETHING, HE DID
 SOMETHING, ONE OF THE ABOVE.
 I WOULD ASSUME IF MICHAEL OR
 ANY OF HIS PEOPLE HAD SUMPIN' TO
 DO WITH IT IT'S FOR DOPE.
 THEY'RE GONNA HAVE ENOUGH SENSE
 TO [ BLEEP ] BE ABLE TO BEAT,
 WHAT, AN ENTIRE TEAM OF
 INVESTIGATORS?
 I DOUBT IT, DUDE.
 I DOUBT IT.
 I FIGURE, BY THE TIME
 EVERYBODY'S D.N.A. COMES BACK,
 'CAUSE I KNOW I'M NOT THE ONLY
 SWAB YOU GOT, SOMEBODY'LL GET
 CAUGHT UP.
 SO YOU -YOU -YOU'RE
 COMPLETELY CONFIDENT YOUR D.N.A.
 IS NOT IN THAT HOUSE ANYWHERE?
 I KNOW IT'S NOT.
 I KNOW IT'S NOT.
 HE -HE KEEPS SAYING, YOU
 KNOW, "I -I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
 SO I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO
 WORRY ABOUT."
 Reporter: BUT WAS HE IN FACT
 ON YOUR LIST AT THAT POINT?
 OH, HE -HE WAS, YOU KNOW.
 HE WAS, HE PUT HIMSELF WITH
 MICHAEL.
 WELL, I THINK YOU KNOW A
 LITTLE BIT MORE THAN YOU'RE
 TELLING ME.
 SIR, I DON'T.
 I -I -I'VE -I'M GIVING YOU
 PEARLS, MAN.
 I'M GIVING YOU ALL I GOT.
 I -I'VE TOLD YOU GUYS
 EVERYTHING I KNOW.
 I KNOW THAT HE CAME OVER.
 I KNOW EXACTLY WHEN HE LEFT.
 I KNOW I WAS AT MY HOUSE.
 THAT'S ALL I KNOW.
 Reporter: FOR ALL HIS
 QUESTIONS, INVESTIGATOR EDMUNDS
 ULTIMATELY HAD NOTHING ON
 ANTHONY.
 A FAILED POLYGRAPH ISN'T
 EVIDENCE, AND NOTHING CONNECTED
 HIM TO THE CRIME.
 BUT THEY WERE STILL LOOKING AT
 MICHAEL, AND THERE WAS THE
 INEVITABLE QUESTION OF MOTIVE.
 SURE, MICHAEL WAS OPEN ABOUT HIS
 DRUG USE, BUT THAT DIDN'T
 ENTIRELY EXPLAIN WHY HE WOULD
 SAVAGELY BEAT HIS MOM'S BEST
 FRIEND.
 MY BOOKKEEPER CAME TO ME AND
 SAID "WE'VE GOT SOME ISSUES
 HERE."
 Reporter: JURGEN COWLING HAS
 A STORY TO TELL ABOUT MICHAEL.
 BECKY AND KAY BOTH WORKED FOR
 HIM AT HEALING HANDS PHYSICAL
 THERAPY CENTER, AND SOMETIMES
 MICHAEL WOULD DO ODD JOBS AT THE
 OFFICE TOO.
 MICHAEL WOULD COME IN AND DO
 SOME MORE, WE HAD SOME FLOORING
 THAT'D BE PUT IN, SOME CARPET.
 AND THEN HE WOULD COME IN AND
 ASSIST.
 Reporter: BUT AFTER A WHILE
 PEOPLE IN THE OFFICE STARTED TO
 NOTICE SOMETHING.
 WE HAD SOME BLANK CHECKS
 IN -IN ONE OF OUR OFFICES THAT
 DISAPPEARED.
 Reporter: BECKY AND KAY'S
 BOSS SAYS THE CHECKS WENT
 MISSING WHILE MICHAEL HAD BEEN
 DOING SOME CLEANING IN THE
 OFFICE.
 SO I -I PULL -BECKY IN.
 SHE SAID SHE SAT DOWN WITH
 MICHAEL AND TALKED ABOUT IT.
 AND, OF COURSE, MICHAEL SAID,
 "YES, IT WAS ME."
 Reporter: HOW MUCH MONEY WAS
 STOLEN IN THAT INCIDENT?
 ABOUT 800 BUCKS.
 Reporter: 800 BUCKS?
 YEAH, THREE OR FOUR CHECKS,
 ABOUT 800 BUCKS.
 Reporter: AND IT WAS ALL
 MICHAEL.
 AND HE 'FESSED UP TO IT, HUH?
 YES, SIR.
 Reporter: SO BECKY MUST HAVE
 BEEN, WHAT, EM -EMBARRASSED?
 YOU COULD TELL SHE WAS REALLY
 DISTRAUGHT.
 Reporter: THE HEALING HANDS
 BOSS AGREED WITH BECKY THAT HE
 WOULDN'T REPORT THE INCIDENT TO
 POLICE, AS LONG AS MICHAEL NEVER
 CAME BACK THERE.
 BUT HAD BECKY'S FRIEND AND
 CO-WORKER KAY FOUND OUT ABOUT
 THE STOLEN CHECK FUNNY-BUSINESS?
 COULD THAT HAVE LED TO A
 CONFLICT BETWEEN MICHAEL AND
 KAY?
 BUT, HERE'S THE THING, THE
 AUTHORITIES WOULDN'T EVEN LEARN
 ABOUT THE "HEALING HANDS" THEFT
 FOR MONTHS TO COME.
 EVEN WITHOUT THAT STORY ABOUT
 THE THEFT, MICHAEL WAS SHAPING
 UP TO BE A PRIME SUSPECT IN THE
 MURDER.
 IT WASN'T LOOKING REAL GOOD
 FOR HIM.
 THINGS STARTED -STARTED PILING
 UP.
 Reporter: THEN SOMETHING
 HAPPENED THAT WOULD STAND THE
 INVESTIGATION ON ITS HEAD MORE
 VIOLENCE, MORE MAYHEM, WITH
 ANOTHER SUDDEN ATTACK.
 COMING UP -WHO WAS THE
 VICTIM THIS TIME?
 WAS SOMEONE STALKING WOMEN IN
 THIS SMALL TOWN?
 SOMEBODY CAME OUT OF THE
 TREES AND HE SHOT ME.
 DO YOU KNOW WHERE IT'S AT?
 ON MY LEG.
 WHEN SECRETS ON HOT SPRINGS
 DRIVE CONTINUES.
                  LEG WHEN SECRETS ON HOT SPRINGS
 DRIVE CONTINUES.

 WELCOME BACK. INVESTIGATORS HAD ZEROED IN ON
 MICHAEL BOWERS AS THE PRIME
 SUSPECT IN THE MURDER OF KAY
 PARSONS.
 MICHAEL'S MOM WAS KAY'S CLOSEST
 FRIEND.
 RAISING MORE QUESTIONS.
 BUT SOON ANOTHER VIOLENT ATTACK
 WOULD LEAD TO A STARTLING
 ADMISSION.
 HERE AGAIN IS DENNIS MURPHY.
 BUT THERE WAS AT LEAST ONE
 PERSON WHO STOOD SQUARELY
 BEHIND.
 BECKY'S GOOD FRIEND KNEW ALL
 ABOUT MICHAEL'S STRUGGLE WITH
 DRUGS.
 STILL SHE WOULDN'T ACCEPT SHE
 HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE THE
 MURDER.
 DID YOU WONDER WHO WAS GOING
 ON?
 I DIDN'T REALLY.
 KNOWING MICHAEL, I KNEW HE
 WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
 Reporter: THEN JUST 36 HOURS
 INTO THE MURDER INVESTIGATION
 ANOTHER ATTACK. THIS TIME A
 SHOOTING.
 JUST TEN MILES FROM THE CRIME
 SCENE ON HOT SPRINGS DRIVE.

 SOMEBODY CAME OUT FROM BEHIND
 THE TREES AND HE SHOT ME.
 Reporter: SERGEANT
 STEVEN DOUGLAS WAS DISPATCHED TO
 THE SCENE.
 MY PARTNER AND I RECEIVED A
 PHONE CALL FROM THE ROAD PATROL
 DIVISION IN REFERENCE TO A WOMAN
 WHO HAD APPARENTLY BEEN THE
 VICTIM OF AN ARMED ROBBERY AS
 SHE WAS LEAVING WORK THAT
 EVENING.
 AND HAD APPARENTLY BEEN SHOT IN
 THE PROCESS.
 DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU'RE HIT
 AT?
 MY LEGS.
 Reporter: THE LOCATION OF THE
 SHOOTING SOUNDED FAMILIAR.
 WHAT'S THE NAME OF YOUR
 OFFICE?
 IT'S HEALING HANDS PHYSICAL
 THERAPY.
 Reporter: SO DID THE NAME OF
 THE VICTIM.
 WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
 BECKY SEARS.
 Reporter: BECKY SEARS, THE
 BEST FRIEND AND CO-WORKER OF
 MURDER VICTIM KAY PARSONS.
 THAT IS KIND OF A HOLY COW
 MOMENT.
 THIS IS THE SAME WOMAN NEXT DOOR
 TO THIS HOUSE WHERE THERE'D BEEN
 A VICIOUS BEATING.
 YES.
 IT SEEMED AN ODD SET OF
 COINCIDENCES.
 SO THIS IS THE BACK DOOR OF
 HEALING HANDS?
 THIS IS THE BACK DOOR OF THE
 BUSINESS THAT WE GOT CALLED TO.
 Reporter: AS THE SERGEANT
 PULLED UP TO THE SCENE, HE
 LEARNED BECKY HAD BEEN WORKING
 LATE ON THE COMPANY PAYROLL.
 SHE WAS HEADING TO HER CAR WHEN
 SHE WAS JUMPED.
 APPARENTLY WHEN SHE HAD
 TURNED AROUND, AN UNKNOWN MALE
 SUBJECT WEARING DARK CLOTHES AND
 A WHITE BASEBALL CAP RUSHED OUT
 OF THE BUSHES AT HER, WITH A
 FIREARM, DEMANDING HIS MONEY OR
 NEXT TIME IT WAS GOING TO BE HER
 FACE.
 Reporter: THAT'S WHEN THE
 ASSAILANT SHOT BECKY IN THE
 LEGS.
 THE SUBJECT APPARENTLY DIDN'T
 ROB HER, DIDN'T TAKE ANYTHING
 FROM HER, BUT TURNED AROUND AND
 RAN BACK INTO THE BUSHES THE WAY
 THAT HE CAME.
 SHE'S NOT KNOWN FOR DOING THE
 NIGHT DEPOSITS WITH CASH.
 THERE'S NO CASH HERE.
 EXACTLY.
 NOT AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT.
 WHAT'S THE TARGET, WHAT ARE
 YOU GOING TO GET?
 HAS TO BE PERSONAL.
 I WOULD THINK SO.
 Reporter: EMTS TRANSPORTED
 BECKY TO THE LOCAL HOSPITAL.
 IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG FOR THE
 TROUBLING NEWS TO REACH BECKY'S
 FRIEND MICHELLE.
 DID YOU TALK TO BECKY ON THE
 PHONE AFTER SHE'D BEEN SHOT?
 I DID.
 I JUST ASKED HER, WAS SHE OK?
 AND SHE SAID "I AM."
 SHE SAID, "YOU KNOW, JUST TRYIN'
 TO GET THRU THIS."
 SHE'S YOUR FRIEND, YOU'RE
 WORRIED, HUH?
 YES, WORRIED ABOUT HER.
 Reporter: SO WAS
 TAMARA BALDWIN.
 FIRST KAY NOW BECKY?
 IT JUST, IT DID NOT MAKE
 SENSE TO ME.
 WHAT IN THE WORLD WAS GOIN'
 ON?
 THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO KNOW.
 Reporter: SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES
 IMMEDIATELY CANVASSED THE
 NEIGHBORHOOD, LOOKING FOR ANYONE
 MATCHING BECKY'S DESCRIPTION OF
 THE SHOOTER.
 SO YOU HAVE A GUNMAN ON THE
 GROUND ON THE LOOSE.
 RIGHT.
 WHAT ARE YOU DOING ON THAT
 SCORE?
 WE HAD STARTED SENDING UNITS
 OUT TO SEE IF ANYBODY HAD SEEN
 ANYTHING, SEE IF ANYBODY HEARD
 ANY GUNSHOTS.
 SEE IF ANYBODY SAW ANYBODY
 MATCHING THE DESCRIPTION OF THE
 SUSPECT.
 AND WE WERE NOT ABLE TO FIND
 ANYTHING.
 Reporter: THE ONLY FORENSIC
 EVIDENCE DOUGLAS COULD FIND IN
 THE PARKING LOT WAS
 THE .25 CALIBER SLUG THAT GRAZED
 BECKY'S LEGS.
 HER SHOES WERE STILL LAYING
 THERE.
 WE FOUND A SPENT SHELL
 CASING, AND THEN WE HAD ALSO
 FOUND THE ACTUAL PROJECTILE
 ITSELF, RIGHT ON THE EDGE OF THE
 SIDEWALK.
 AND YOU DIDN'T FIND A TOSSED
 WEAPON IN THE VICINITY?
 NO, NO WEAPONS.
 Reporter: THE SHOOTER HAD
 VANISHED WITHOUT A TRACE.
 BUT YOU HAD MORE QUESTIONS,
 DIDN'T YOU?
 WE DID INDEED.
 Reporter: BUT THOSE QUESTIONS
 WOULD BE LEFT FOR JIMMY EDMUNDS,
 WHOSE INVESTIGATION INTO
 KAY PARSONS'S MURDER HAD
 SUDDENLY BECOME A LOT MORE
 COMPLEX.
 HERE I'VE GOT TWO NEIGHBORS,
 YOU KNOW, ONE HAS BEEN BEATEN TO
 DEATH AND THE OTHER ONE HAS JUST
 GOTTEN SHOT.
 AND THEY BOTH WORKED AT HEALING
 HANDS.
 DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE
 GUNMAN WHO HAS WOUNDED BECKY IS
 ALSO THE PERSON WHO'S BROKEN IN
 AND FATALLY BEATEN MISS PARSONS?
 OF COURSE THAT COMES TO MIND.
 I MEAN, OF COURSE IT DOES.
 IT'S JUST TOO MUCH OF A
 COINCIDENCE.
 Reporter: AND NOTHING ABOUT
 THIS SHOOTING TOOK THE HEAT OFF
 BECKY'S SON MICHAEL.
 WHAT'S THE WORKING THEORY?
 THE WORKING THEORY STILL IS,
 MICHAEL'S STILL PRETTY HIGH UP
 ON THE LIST.
 SOMEBODY'S LOOKING FOR SOME
 MONEY.
 SOMEBODY OWES SOMEBODY SOME
 MONEY.
 Reporter: EDMUNDS HAD SOME
 TOUGH, PERSONAL QUESTIONS FOR
 BECKY ABOUT HER SON MICHAEL.
 THANKFULLY THE WOUNDS TO BECKY'S
 LEGS WERE SUPERFICIAL.
 SO EDMUNDS GRABBED HIS NOTE PAD,
 AND HIS TAPE RECORDER, AND
 HEADED TO THE HOSPITAL.
 BECKY, SHE'S IN THE HOSPITAL
 BED.
 RIGHT.
 NOT TOO BADLY INJURED.

 WHEN I'M TALKIN' TO HER, SHE'S,
 YOU KNOW, SHE'S REALLY HURTING.
 Reporter: THE INVESTIGATOR
 THEN ASKED BECKY FOR DETAILS
 ABOUT SHOOTING.
 WHAT DID HE SAY TO YOU?
 WHO?
 THE GUY THAT SHOT YOU?
 HE WANTED HIS MONEY OR NEXT
 TIME IT WOULD BE MY FACE.
 WHAT MONEY IS HE TALKING
 ABOUT?
 I HAVE NO IDEA.
 WE DID NOT OWE ANYBODY ANY
 MONEY.
 DOES MICHAEL?
 NOT THAT I KNOW OF.
 I DON'T WANT YOU DEAD NEXT.
 I DON'T THINK MICHAEL KNOWS.
 UNLESS HE OWES MONEY FROM THE
 PAST, I DON'T THINK HE OWES ANY
 MONEY NOW.
 Reporter: TO EDMUNDS, BECKY
 SOUNDED LIKE A MOM UNWILLING OR
 UNABLE TO WRAP HER HEAD AROUND
 THE POSSIBILITY OF HER SON'S
 INVOLVEMENT IN A MURDER.
 I THINK HE'S TRYING TO STAY
 AWAY FROM ALL OF THAT TO GET
 OUT -TO BETTER HIMSELF.
 Reporter: EDMUNDS SPUN
 THROUGH THE POSSIBILITIES --
 WAS BECKY IN DENIAL?
 WAS SHE COVERING UP FOR HER SON?
 OR WAS HE HEADING DOWN THE WRONG
 PATH WITH MICHAEL ALTOGETHER.
 HE DECIDED TO CAST A WIDER NET.
 IS THERE SOME -ANY
 RELATIONSHIPS YOU'RE NOT TELLING
 US ABOUT?
 LIKE?
 YOU HAVEN'T HAD ANY PROBLEMS
 WITH ANYBODY?
 NO, NOBODY.
 FAMILY PROBLEMS?
 Reporter: THAT'S WHEN BECKY
 REVEALED AN INTIMATE DETAIL FROM
 HER RECENT PAST.
 SHE AND HER HUSBAND TONY HAD
 GONE THROUGH A ROUGH PATCH IN
 THEIR MARRIAGE.
 I MEAN MY HUSBAND AND I WERE
 HAVING SOME PROBLEMS, WHICH WE
 WERE THANKFULLY WORKING OUT.
 DO YOU HAVE ANY RELATIONSHIPS
 ON THE SIDE?
 I DID.
 HOW LONG HAS THAT BEEN?
 HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN OVER?
 YEAH.
 THREE MONTHS.
 Reporter: SUDDENLY, ADDED TO
 THE MIX OF A BRUTAL MURDER AND A
 BIZARRE SHOOTING WAS THIS
 ADMISSION OF AN EXTRA MARITAL
 ROMANCE.
 I MEAN IT WASN'T LIKE IT WAS
 A LONG LASTING THING.
 IT WAS JUST A COUPLE OF MONTHS
 LONG.
 Reporter: EDMUNDS DIDN'T
 PRESS BECKY ANY FURTHER ABOUT
 THE AFFAIR.
 A HOSPITAL ROOM IMMEDIATELY
 FOLLOWING A SHOOTING WAS NEITHER
 THE TIME NOR THE PLACE.
 BUT THE INVESTIGATOR WAS
 INTRIGUED.
 HE LEFT BECKY WONDERING WHO THE
 "OTHER MAN" WAS.
 I KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHIN'
 THERE.
 I JUST COULDN'T -JUST COULDN'T
 FIGURE OUT WHAT YET.
 TURNED OUT THERE WAS?
 THERE WAS.
 YEAH, THERE WAS.
 THERE WAS SOME SECRETS.
 Reporter: COMING UP --
 I NEVER MINUTE FOR THIS TO
 HAPPEN.
        HAPPEN
 Let's be honest:
 you need insurance.
 But it's not really something you want to buy.
          It's not sexy.
          Or delicious.
             Or fun.
   But since you need both car       and home insurance,
    why not bundle them with   Esurance and save up to 10%?
 Which you can spend on things you really want to buy, like...
     well, I don't know what         you'd wanna buy
                because I'm just                a guy on your TV.
   Esurance. It's surprisingly            painless.
