 FOR HOSTING THIS EVENT. IT'S BEEN AN AMAZING NIGHT.
 FIVE OF THE TOP PRESIDENTIAL
 CANDIDATES HAVE SHARING THE SAME
 STAGE TONIGHT WITH YOUNG ADULTS
 FOR STUDENTS WHO PLAN TO VOTE IN
 THEIR STATE AND PRIMARY
 CAUCUSES.
 WE'VE ALREADY HEARD FROM
 SENATORS AMY KLOBUCHAR,
 ELIZABETH WARREN AND BERNIE
 SANDERS.
 RIGHT NOW IT'S TIME TO WELCOME
 TO THIS STAGE SENATOR KAMALA
 HARRIS OF CALIFORNIA.
 HI, HI.
 GOOD TO SEE YOU.

 HAVE A SEAT.
 THANK YOU.
 WOW, THEY'RE HAPPY TO SEE
 YOU.
 GOOD TO SEE YOU GUYS.
 LET'S GET TO IT.
 WE WANT YOU TO GET AS MUCH OUT
 OF THE NEXT HOUR AS POSSIBLE.
 LET'S START WITH WHAT'S
 DOMINATING THE NEWS, THE FALLOUT
 FROM THE MUELLER REPORT.
 YES.
 WE HAVE A QUESTION FROM C
 CARCARLA
 ALVARADO, A SENIOR FROM
 MASSACHUSETTS.
 GOOD EVENING, SENATOR HARRIS,
 IN LIGHT OF MUELLER'S REPORT DO
 YOU BELIEVE THE DEMOCRATS A
 CONGRESS SHOULD RECONSIDER THEIR
 POSITION ON IMPEACHMENT?
 IT DEPENDS ON WHO YOU'RE
 TALKING TO ON WHAT THEIR
 POSITION IS, HERE'S WHAT I FEEL
 ABOUT IT AND THANK YOU FOR THE
 QUESTION, CARLA.
 LOOK, FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE
 BEEN FOLLOWING THE INVESTIGATION
 AND HAVE SEEN ANY PART OF THAT
 REPORT IT IS VERY CLEAR THAT
 THERE IS A LOT OF GOOD EVIDENCE
 POINTING TO OBSTRUCTION AND
 OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.
 AND I BELIEVE VERY STRONGLY,
 FIRST OF ALL LET ME JUST BE VERY
 CLEAR -- THE TABLE SET.
 I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO GET
 RID OF THIS PRESIDENT.
 THAT'S WHY I'M RUNNING TO BECOME
 PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
 THAT IS PART OF THE PREMISE,
 OBVIOUSLY, OF MY PLAN.
 BUT I THINK WE ARE VERY GOOD
 REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS
 AN INVESTIGATION THAT HAS BEEN
 CONDUCTED WHICH HAS PRODUCED
 EVIDENCE THAT TELLS US THAT THIS
 PRESIDENT AND HIS ADMINISTRATION
 ENGAGED IN OBSTRUCTION OF
 JUSTICE.
 I BELIEVE CONGRESS SHOULD TAKE
 THE STEPS TOWARDS IMPEACHMENT.
 BUT I WANT TO SAY THIS, BECAUSE
 IT DOESN'T END THERE.
 I ALSO WANT TO SAY THIS.
 I'M ALSO A REALIST.
 AND WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT HAS BEEN
 HAPPENING OVER THE TWO YEARS AND
 SOME MONTHS I'VE BEEN IN THE
 UNITED STATES SENATE I HAVE ALSO
 WITNESSED FOLKS IN THE UNITED
 STATES CONGRESS AND IN
 PARTICULAR IN THE GOP WHO HAVE
 BEEN PRESENTED WITH MANY REASONS
 TO PUSH BACK AGAINST THIS
 PRESIDENT AND THEY HAVE NOT.
 AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THE
 IMPEACHMENT PROCESS THERE WILL
 BE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE HOUSE AND
 AN INVESTIGATION THAT TAKES
 PLACE.
 I THINK WE CAN BE PRETTY SURE IT
 LOOKS LIKE THAT IS VERY LIKELY
 TO HAPPEN AND THEN IT'S GOING TO
 GO OVER TO THE SENATE.
 AND THE HOUSE NEEDS TO BE A VOTE
 BY A MAJORITY, A SIMPLE MAJORITY
 AND THEN IT'S GOING TO COME OVER
 TO THE SENATE AND I'VE NOT SEEN
 ANY EVIDENCE, SINCE I'VE BEEN IN
 THE UNITED STATES SENATE, THAT
 THE UNITED STATES SENATE AND THE
 REPUBLICANS HOLD THE MAJORITY,
 I'VE NOT SEEN ANY EVIDENCE TO
 SUGGEST THAT THEY WILL WEIGH ON
 THE FACTS INSTEAD OF ON PARTISAN
 ADHERENCE TO BEING PROTECTIVE OF
 THIS PRESIDENT AND THAT'S WHAT
 CONCERNS ME AND WHAT WILL BE THE
 EVENTUAL OUTCOME.
 WE HAVE TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT
 THE END RESULT BUT THAT DOESN'T
 MEAN THE PROCESS SHOULD NOT TAKE
 HOLD.
 THANK YOU, SENATOR.
 A LOT OF STUDENTS HERE AT THE
 HARVARD INSTITUTE OF POLITICS,
 THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT GUN
 VIOLENCE AND HOW THAT AFFECTS
 THEM AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS.
 BEN.
 THANK YOU, SENATOR, AS A
 FUTURE EDUCATOR I AM REALLY
 BOTHERED THAT PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE
 BEING TARGETS FOR MASS
 SHOOTINGS.
 TWO DAYS AGO WAS THE 20th
 ANNIVERSARY OF THE COLUMBINE
 MASSACRE, BUT TWO DECADES LATER
 NO MAJOR GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION
 HAS BEEN PASSED.
 AS PRESIDENT WHO WILL YOU GO
 ABOUT KEEPING OUR SCHOOLS SAFE
 AND KEEPING GUNS OUT OF THE
 HANDS OF THOSE WHO SHOULD NOT
 HAVE THEM?
 I'M SURE THERE ARE PLENTY OF
 STUDENTS HERE, WHILE YOU WERE IN
 HIGH SCHOOL, EVEN MIDDLE SCHOOL,
 THAT YOU HAD TO PARTICIPATE IN A
 DRILL, RIGHT, WHERE YOU WERE
 CONVENED AND YOUR TEACHERS
 TAUGHT YOU ABOUT HOW YOU NEED TO
 GO AND RUN IN A CLOSET BECAUSE
 THERE MAY BE A MASS SHOOTER
 ROAMING THE HALLWAYS OF YOUR
 SCHOOL.
 AND IN OUR AMERICA THAT SHOULD
 NEVER HAVE TO HAPPEN.
 CONVERSATIONS TAKE PLACE EVERY
 NIGHT, CONVERSATIONS TAKE PLACE
 EVERY NIGHT BETWEEN STATUTES AND
 THEIR PARENTS, WHY DO THESE
 THINGS HAVE TO HAPPEN, WHY DO WE
 HAVE TO HAVE A DRILL LIKE THAT
 AND THE RESPONSE IS THERE ARE
 PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON, D.C.,
 SUPPOSED LEADERS WHO HAVE FAILED
 TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO REJECT A
 FALSE CHOICE WHICH YOU'RE EITHER
 IN FAVOR OF SECOND AMENDMENT OR
 YOU WANT TO TAKE PEOPLE'S GUNS
 AWAY.
 SUPPOSED LEADERS IN
 WASHINGTON, D.C. TO HAVE FAILED
 TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO
 RECOGNIZE, YOU WANT TO GO
 HUNTING, THAT'S FINE, BUT WE
 NEED REASONABLE GUN SAFETY LAWS
 IN THIS COUNTRY, STARTING WITH
 UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS AND
 A RENEWAL OF THE ASSAULT WEAPON
 BAN BUT THEY HAVE FAILED TO HAVE
 THE COURAGE TO ACT.
 BEN HERE IS MY RESPONSE TO YOU.
 UPON BEING ELECTED I WILL GIVE
 THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS 100
 DAYS TO GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER
 AND HAVE THE COURAGE TO PASS
 REASONABLE GUN SAFETY LAWS.
 AND IF THEY FAIL TO DO IT, THEN
 I WILL TAKE EXECUTIVE ACTION.
 AND SPECIFICALLY WHAT I WILL DO
 IS PUT IN PLACE A REQUIREMENT
 THAT FOR ANYONE WHO SELLS MORE
 THAN FIVE GUNS A YEAR THEY ARE
 REQUIRED TO DO BACKGROUND CHECKS
 WHEN THEY SELL THOSE GUNS.
 I WILL REQUIRE THAT FOR ANY GUN
 DEALER THAT BREAKS THE LAW THE
 ATF TAKE THEIR LICENSE.
 AND BY THE WAY, ATF, ALCOHOL,
 TOBACCO AND FIREARMS, THEY'VE
 BEEN DOING A LOT OF "A" ANDTâ– IF"
 WE NEED TO FIX THAT.
 AND THEN -- ON THE THIRD PIECE,
 BECAUSE NONE OF US HAVE BEEN
 SLEEPING THE LAST TWO YEARS,
 PART OF WHAT'S HAPPENED UNDER
 THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION IS
 THEY TYKE FUGITIVES OFF THE LIST
 OF PROHIBITED PEOPLE.
 I PUT THEM BACK ON THE LIST,
 MEANING THAT FUGITIVES FROM
 JUSTICE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO
 PURCHASE A HANDGUN OR ANY KIND
 OF WEAPON.
 SO THAT'S WHAT I'D DO.
 WOULD THIS BE YOUR FIRST
 EXECUTIVE ACTION AS PRESIDENT?
 WELL, IT DEPENDS ON WHAT ELSE
 HAPPENS.
 AFTER 100 DAYS.
 LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE
 FIRST 100 DAYS.
 ALL RIGHT, FAIR ENOUGH.
 ANGELA IS A FRESHMAN STUDYING
 INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS.
 SHE IS FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE.
 ANGELA?
 GOOD EVENING, SENATOR, MY
 QUESTION IS AS A COLLEGE STUDENT
 WITH OVER $25,000 OF DEBT IN MY
 FIRST YEAR ALONE WHAT WILL YOU
 DO TO ALLEVIATE THE FINANCIAL
 BURDENS OF THE STUDENT DEBT
 CRISIS.
 DO YOU SUPPORT INITIATIVES SUCH
 AS FREE COLLEGE, LOAN PROTECTIVE
 LEGISLATION, OR STUDENT
 REPAYMENT PLANS?
 YEAH, ANGELA.
 KNOW, LISTEN, THE STUDENTS
 IN NEW HAMPSHIRE ARE AMONG THE
 TOP FIVE IN THE COUNTRY WITH
 STUDENT LOAN DEBT.
 AND IT IS ABSOLUTELY
 UNCONSCIONABLE THAT WE HAVE
 STUDENTS IN AMERICA WHO ARE IN
 ABSOLUTE FEAR ABOUT THE DEBT
 THAT THEY WILL OWE UPON
 GRADUATION.
 AND I HAVE MET AND KNOW SO MANY
 STUDENTS WHO ARE MAKING
 DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR CAREER
 BASED ON THEIR FEAR THAT THEY
 MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PAY THEIR
 BILLS.
 I KNOW SO MANY STUDENTS WHO HAVE
 GRADUATED WHO ARE MAKING
 DECISIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT
 TO HAVE A FAMILY BASED ON THE
 BURDEN OF THEIR STUDENT LOAN
 DEBT AND BEING CONCERNED ABOUT
 WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO
 ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH
 THE MONTH.
 WE CANNOT AFFORD TO HAVE A
 SYSTEM LIKE THIS, ESPECIALLY FOR
 YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE MADE AN
 INVESTMENT OF THEIR TIME AND
 THEIR RESOURCES BECAUSE THEY
 ACTUALLY WANT AN EDUCATION TO
 LIVE A PRODUCTIVE LIFE AND
 CONTRIBUTE TO OUR SOCIETY AND BE
 LEADERS.
 HERE'S WHAT I WOULD DO
 SPECIFICALLY.
 I DO SUPPORT DEBT FREE COLLEGE.
 I ALSO BELIEVE THAT WHAT WE NEED
 TO DO IS WE NEED TO ALLOW
 STUDENTS TO REFINANCE YOUR
 STUDENT LOAN DEBT AND IN
 PARTICULAR I'M SUPPORTING AN
 INITIATIVE THAT WOULD ALLOW YOU
 TO REFINANCE YOUR STUDENT LOAN
 DEBTING TO BE ON PAR WITH
 FEDERAL LENDING AMOUNTS.
 FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU -- PROBABLY
 NONE OF YOU HERE, BUT ANY OF
 YOUR OLDER BROTHERS AND SISTERS
 IF YOU TOOK OUT STUDENT LOANS
 BETWEEN 2006 AND 2013, THE
 INTEREST RATE WAS ABOUT 7%.
 WHAT I AM PROPOSING IS
 REGARDLESS OF THE INTEREST RATE
 AT THE TIME THAT YOU TOOK OUT
 OUR STUDENT LOANS, THAT UPON
 REPAYMENT IT WOULD HAVE TO BE AT

 THE OTHER THING IS THIS.
 PART OF THE ISSUE IS THAT TERMS
 OF REPAYMENT THERE IS NO
 CONNECTION BETWEEN WHAT YOU OWE
 AND YOUR INCOME.
 WHAT I WOULD BE REQUIRING IS
 THAT THERE BE A ROBUST PROCESS
 BY WHICH INCOME-BASED REPAYMENT
 WOULD BE THE NORM.
 AND FINALLY LET'S LOOK AT THE
 FACT THAT FOR ALL OF YOU AND ALL
 OF ANYBODY WHO HAS APPLIED FOR
 FINANCIAL AID THAT IS AN AWFUL
 PROCESS.
 YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING
 ABOUT.
 ALL THOSE PAGES.
 YOU CAN'T BARELY GET THROUGH
 THAT FORM.
 AND SO PART OF WHAT WE NEED TO
 DO IS SIMPLIFY THAT PROCESS.
 BUT WE HAVE GOT TO DO A BETTER
 JOB IN THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE, YOU
 KNOW, I LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE,
 FOR EXAMPLE, TEACHERS.
 YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN SPENDING A
 LOT OF TIME, I THINK A LOT ABOUT
 EDUCATION IN TERMS OF EVERY
 ASPECT OF IT FROM STUDENT LOANS
 TO WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO PAY OUR
 TEACHERS THEIR VALUE.
 AND  NUMBER OF TEACHERS WHO
 HAVE LEFT THE PROFESSION OF
 TEACHING BECAUSE THEY CAN'T
 AFFORD TO PAY OFF THEIR STUDENT
 LOANS RIGHT NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT
 ACTUALLY A DEFICIT OF TEACHERS
 BASED ON THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS
 WE NEED TO ACTUALLY TEACH AND
 THE FEW TEACHERS WE HAVE,
 ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS, IT'S
 A BIG ISSUE AND CROSSES A LOT OF
 SUBJECTS.
 TEACHERS CAN'T PAY THEIR
 LOANS.
 ELIZABETH WARREN IS HERE, AS YOU
 KNOW, SHE SAID THAT SHE SUPPORTS
 STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS FOR 42
 MILLION AMERICANS.
 WOULD YOU GO THAT FAR?
 DO YOU SUPPORT THAT?
 WELL, I SUPPORT ANYTHING THAT
 IS ABOUT REDUCING THE DEBT OF
 STUDENT LOANS.
 THAT'S AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION
 TO HAVE.
 FAIR ENOUGH.
 LET'S MOVE ON NOW.
 RYAN WILSON IS HERE, A SOPHOMORE
 AT HARVARD STUDYING NEUROSCIENCE
 IN CALIFORNIA AND A SUPPORTER OF
 JULIAN CASTRO.
 RYAN.
 HI, GOOD EVENING SENATOR
 HARRIS, I'M A CONSTITUENT OF
 YOURS FROM ORANGE COUNTY,
 CALIFORNIA.
 AT JANUARY TOWN HALL WHEN ASKED
 ABOUT YOUR APPROACH TO UNIVERSAL
 HEALTH CARE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGED
 YOU WOULD SUPPORT -- HOW DO YOU
 RESPOND TO THE 74% OF AMERICANS
 WHO WISH TO HAVE THE OPTION TO
 KEEP THEIR PRIVATE INSURERS?
 WELL, I SUPPORT MEDICARE FOR
 ALL.
 AND I SUPPORT IT FOR A NUMBER OF
 REASONS.
 THAT INCLUDE THE FACT THAT THERE
 ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN OUR
 COUNTRY WHO SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE
 ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE BECAUSE
 THEY CANNOT AFFORD IT AND THAT'S
 UNCONSCIONABLE AND I BELIEVE
 IT'S A MORAL ISSUE AND IT IS A
 SIGN OF WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE
 GOING TO BE A CIVIL SOCIETY.
 TO DETERMINE ARE PEOPLE GOING TO
 HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE
 SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY CAN AFFORD
 IT WHEN, IN FACT, THAT SHOULD BE
 A RIGHT AND NOT A PRIVILEGE OF
 THE FEW WHO CAN AFFORD IT.
 THAT IS THE VALUE WITH WHICH I
 I WILL ALSO SAY THIS.ION.
 ON THE ISSUE OF THIS WHOLE
 DYNAMIC ABOUT ACCESS TO PRIVATE
 INSURANCE, OF COURSE PRIVATE
 INSURANCE YOU CAN GET
 SUPPLEMENTAL INSURANCE AND ALL
 OF THAT.
 BUT LET'S NOT BE DUPED BY A
 MESSAGING CAMPAIGN THAT HAS BEEN
 WAGED FOR YEARS BY THE INSURANCE
 COMPANIES TO HAVE YOU INTO
 BELIEVING YOU NEED TO DEFEND
 THEM.
 YOU NEED TO DEFEND YOURSELF.
 YOU KNOW WHAT, 91% OF THE
 DOCTORS ARE IN MEDICARE.
 SO THE IDEA AND THE SUGGESTION
 THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE TO YOU IS
 REALLY A FALSE ONE.
 YOU WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE YOUR
 DOCTOR.
 91% OF THEM ARE IN THE MEDICARE
 SYSTEM.
 AND I'LL TELL YOU ANOTHER THING,
 AND IT'S A PERSONAL STORY, MY
 MOTHER, WHO -- YOU KNOW, MY
 MOTHER WAS ALL OF 5'0" TALL, IF
 YOU WOULD HAVE MET HER, YOU
 WOULD HAVE THOUGHT SHE WAS 7'0".
 INCREDIBLE WOMAN, BREAST CANCER,
 RESEARCHER.
 WE GOT CANCER.
 AND SHE ULTIMATELY PASSED AWAY
 FROM CANCER.
 BUT IF YOU HAVE EVER HAD THE
 UNFORTUNATE EXPERIENCE OF GOING
 THROUGH THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM
 WITH SOMEONE WHO HAS AN ACUTE
 ILLNESS, I'M GOING TO TELL YOU
 WHAT THAT IS.
 IT IS HAVING A DOCTOR SAY TO YOU
 HAVE YOU HEARD OF THE TERM
 ANTICIPATORY GRIEF?
 WHICH YOU HADN'T HEARD BEFORE
 BUT WHEN YOU HEAR IT IT MAKES
 PERFECT SENSE, YOU'RE STARTING
 ALREADY TO GRIEVE THE LOSS OF
 SOMEONE THAT IS STILL AROUND.
 YOU HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF GOING
 IN AND OUT OF HOSPITALS HELPING
 SOMEONE WHO IS FRAIL AND WEAK,
 IN AND OUT OF CARS TO GET INTO A
 HOSPITAL.
 YOU LOOK AT MEDICAL CHARTS AND
 SOMETIMES THE MEDICINE JIVES,
 SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T, SOMETIMES
 THE PEOPLE ARE PAYING ATTENTION
 TO THIS IS THE MEDICATION THAT
 CAUSES DROWSINESS THEY DON'T
 WANT OR PAIN THEY CAN'T BEAR.
 YOU GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF
 WORRYING ABOUT IS THERE
 SOMETHING I CAN COOK AND BE ABLE
 TO FOR YOU TO EAT AND HOLD DOWN.
 THE PROCESS OF BEING CONCERNED
 ABOUT CHEMOTHERAPY, CAN I GET
 YOU SOMETHING SOFT ENOUGH TO
 WEAR THAT WILL NOT IRRITATE YOUR
 SKIN.
 THANKFULLY OUR MOTHER HAD
 MEDICARE, PEOPLE GOING THROUGH
 THIS PROCESS EVERY DAY IN
 AMERICA, FOR THEM TO ALSO HAVE
 TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW
 THEY'RE GOING TO PAY THAT BILL
 IS UNCONSCIONABLE.
 AND THAT'S HOW I FEEL ABOUT THIS
 SUBJECT.
 COSTS SHOULD NOT BE THE BARRIER
 TO RECEIVING THE CARE THAT WILL
 RELIEVE YOU OF PAIN OR HELP
 IMPROVE YOUR QUALITY OF LIFE.
 AND WE'VE GOT TO GET THIS RIGHT.
 THAT'S HOW I FEEL.
 YEAH.
 SO YOU MENTIONED THE INSURANCE
 COMPANIES.
 YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE TO
 DEFEND THE INSURANCE COMPANIES.
 NO, I DON'T HAVE TO --
 THE BILL THAT YOU
 CO-SPONSORED WOULD EFFECTIVELY
 ELIMINATE PRIVATE INSURANCE.
 IS THERE ROOM FOR PRIVATE
 INSURANCE IN --
 OF COURSE THERE IS, FOR
 SUPPLEMENTAL INSURANCE,
 ABSOLUTELY.
 FOR COMPANIES, FOR PRIVATE
 INSURANCE COMPANIES.
 LULT.
 ROOM IN YOUR ADMINISTRATION
 FOR THAT.
 YEAH.
 BUT LISTEN IN THIS BILL.
 BUT DON, I THINK THAT IT'S
 REALLY IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT
 THE GOAL.
 RIGHT, I MEAN, WE CAN TALK ABOUT
 THE INTERMEDIATE STEPS.
 BUT THE GOAL HAS TO BE, AND WE
 ALL HAVE TO AGREE, ACCESS TO
 HEALTH CARE IS A RIGHT AND
 SHOULD BE THOUGHT OF AS A RIGHT
 AND PUBLIC POLICY SHOULD CREATE
 IT SUCH THAT IT IS A REAL RIGHT
 AND NOT A PRIVILEGE FOR THOSE
 WHO CAN AFFORD IT AND IT'S ONE
 OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES IMPACTING
 AMERICAN FAMILIES RIGHT NOW.
 I'M TRAVELING THIS COUNTRY.
 IT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES.
 THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO SIT
 DOWN AND MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT
 WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE
 ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE OR NOT
 BASED ON MONEY, YOU WOULD BE
 SHOCKED, ONE OUT OF FOUR
 DIABETES PATIENTS IN OUR COUNTRY
 CANNOT AFFORD THEIR INSULIN.
 THERE IS A DRUG THAT HELPS SAVE
 A LIFE IF THERE HAS BEEN AN
 OVERDOSE OF OPIOIDS.
 AND THAT DRUG CAN COST UP TO

 THAT'S UNCONSCIONABLE.
 LISTEN, BUT TO BE CLEAR, THIS
 BILL THAT YOU CO-SPONSORED
 ESSENTIALLY PHASES OUT PRIVATE
 INSURANCE IN FOUR YEARS.
 I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT.
 THAT'S WHAT THE STUDIES SHOW,
 THAT IT WOULD PHASE OUT PRIVATE
 INSURANCE.
 I'M ACTUALLY SUPPORTING --
 MEDICARE FOR ALL?
 CO-SPONSORING WITH BERNIE
 SANDERS PHASES OUT PRIVATE
 INSURANCE COMPANIES --
 AS THE MAIN SOURCE, BUT THERE
 WILL STILL BE SUPPLEMENTAL,
 THERE WILL STILL BE ACCESS TO
 SUPPLEMENTAL INSURANCE.
 MEDICARE FOR ALL UNDER THE CARE
 I'M SUPPORTING WILL EXTEND
 COVERAGE, IT DOES NOT COVER
 DENTAL, VISION, HEARING AIDS,
 UNDER THE PLAN MEDICARE FOR ALL
 IT WILL COVER -- THOSE NEEDS
 WILL BE COVERED.
 THEY WILL BE AN EXTENSION OF IT,
 INCLUDING MENTAL HEALTH
 SERVICES, INCLUDING WHAT WE NEED
 TO DO BETTER AROUND WOMEN HAVING
 GREATER ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE
 HEALTH CARE.
 NOW THEEN NEW DEAL.
 YES.
 REEN NEW DEAL, EVERYONE
 HERE WANTS TO KNOW ABOUT THAT.
 MAX RATNER, NOW A STUDENT, HE
 INTERNED FOR SENATOR ED MARKEY.
 SENATOR HARRIS, THANK YOU FOR
 TAKING MY QUESTION.
 THE GREEN NEW DEAL IS NOT A LAW
 BUT RATHER A MEMORANDUM THAT HAS
 NO ACTUAL LEGISLATIVE EFFECT.
 IT'S BEEN CHARACTERIZED AS
 EXPENSIVE, DIVIDES DEMOCRATS AND
 HAS NO CHANCE OF PASSING THROUGH
 CONGRESS IN ITS CURRENT STATE.
 WHY DO YOU SUPPORT IT?
 I SUPPORT IT BECAUSE I, TO MY
 CORE, KNOW THAT THE CLIMATE
 CRISIS IS REPRESENTING AN
 EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO WHO WE ARE
 AS HUMAN BEINGS, WE HAVE
 SUPPOSED LEADERS PUSHING SCIENCE
 FICTION INSTEAD OF SCIENCE FACT
 AND THIS IS TO OUR COLLECTIVE
 PERIL IF WE DON'T TAKE THIS
 MATTER SERIOUSLY WITH A SENSE OF
 YOU ARE URGENCY.
 THE GREEN NEW DEAL APPRECIATES
 THAT WE NEED TO TAKE THIS
 SERIOUSLY AND THE CLOCK IS
 TICKING EVERY DAY ON THIS ISSUE
 AND EVERY DAY WE FAIL TO ACT
 WILL BE TO OUR COLLECTIVE
 CONSEQUENCE.
 THE U.N. HAS ALREADY SAID OVER
 THE NEXT 12 YEARS IF WE DON'T
 GET THIS STRAIGHT THERE WILL BE
 SEVERE CONSEQUENCE AND THIS IS
 WITHIN OUR ABILITY TO DO
 SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
 LISTEN, I HAVE -- FAMILIES ARE
 IMPACTED BY THIS.
 YOU KNOW, CHILDREN, SENIORS, WE
 ALL NEED TO DRINK CLEAN AIR --
 DRINK CLEAN WATER AND BREATHE
 CLEAN AIR.
 AND DON'T DRINK THE AIR.
 YOU LOOK AT FARMERS.
 FARMERS ARE IMPACTED BY THIS.
 CLIMATE CHANGE.
 YOU CAN LOOK AT THE FIREFIGHTERS
 IN CALIFORNIA WHO ARE IMPACTED
 BY CLIMATE CHANGE.
 ACROSS THE BOARD PEOPLE ARE
 BEING IMPACTED BY THIS.
 LET'S ALSO LOOK AT THE FACT THAT
 WE HAVE IN SO MANY STATES GREAT
 WORK THAT IS HAPPENING THAT IS
 ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTING TO THE
 ECONOMY AROUND AN INVESTMENT IN
 RENEWABLE ENERGIES.
 THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS
 CAME OUT WITH A LIST LAST YEAR
 OF THE TOP 20 JOBS THAT ARE
 GOING TO SEE THE GREATEST AMOUNT
 OF GROWTH IN OUR COUNTRY OVER
 THE NEXT TEN YEARS.
 NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO,
 INSULATION MAINTENANCE OF WIND
 TURBINES AND SOLAR PANELS,
 LOOKING AT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF
 WHAT WE KNEE TO BE TRUE ABOUT
 WATER, WATER IS A PRECIOUS AND
 DIMINISHING RESOURCE ON OUR
 PLANET.
 WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S
 HAPPENING AROUND SHIFTING
 POPULATIONS, AROUND THE GLOBE,
 CLIMATE CHANGE IS ONE OF THE
 MAIN FACTORS IN WHAT IS
 HAPPENING.
 THERE WAS A TIME AND STILL TO
 THIS DAY WHERE WE'RE FIGHTING
 WARS OVER OIL.
 IN A SHORT MATTER OF TIME, GUYS,
 WE'RE GOING FIGHTING WARS OVER
 WATER.
 PART OF WHAT WE CAN DO WITH THE
 GREEN NEW DEAL IS HAVE A SENSE
 OF URGENCY ON ALL THESE MATTERS,
 INCLUDING THE PRECIOUS NATURE OF
 WATER AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO
 BE SMARTER ON PUBLIC POLICY.
 I THINK, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT WE
 NEED TO REALLY DIVERSIFY PUBLIC
 POLICY ON WATER WITH AN EQUAL
 EMPHASIS ON RECYCLING,
 CONSERVATION, CAPTURE OF WATER,
 STORAGE OF WATER.
 DESALINATION.
 WE NEED TO INVEST IN ELECTRIC
 CARS.
 WE NEED TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS
 EMISSIONS.
 ALL OF THAT IS IN THE GREEN NEW
 DEAL.
 THE GREATEST THING ABOUT IT THAT
 I AM REALLY ENJOYING, THIS IS
 CAUSING THESE CONVERSATIONS TO
 HAPPEN AROUND OUR COUNTRY IN A
 WAY THEY'VE NOT BEEN IN THE LAST
 FEW YEARS.
 AND HOPEFULLY EVERYONE IS
 UNDERSTANDING THAT SO MUCH OF
 THE HARM WE ARE DOING TO OUR
 PLANET IS CAUSED BY US AS HUMAN
 BEINGS.
 AND THE SOLUTIONS WILL BE
 BECAUSE WE CHANGE OUR BEHAVIORS
 WITHOUT MUCH REQUIREMENT OF
 CHANGE TO LIFESTYLE AND IT WILL
 BE URGENT IN TERMS OF THE WORK
 WE NEED TO DO AND THE APPROACH
 WE NEED TO HAVE.
 BUT WE CAN SEE SUCCESS.
 WE'VE SEEN IT IN CALIFORNIA.
 IN CALIFORNIA WE MADE A DECISION
 THAT WE WOULD GO BACK TO THE
 1990 STANDARDS IN TERMS OF
 EMISSIONS, BY THE YEAR 2020.
 AND WE'VE ALREADY MET THOSE
 GOALS.
 THIS CAN HAPPEN.
 WE CAN DO IT.
 BUT THERE HAS TO BE LEADERSHIP
 IN OUR COUNTRY.
 AND THAT'S ONE OF THE MAIN
 REASONS WE NEED A NEW PRESIDENT
 OF THE UNITED STATES.
 ALL RIGHT.
 SO SPEAKING OF AIR AND WATER,
 LET'S TAKE A BREATHER, GET A SIP
 OF WATER AND WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK
 WITH MORE OF CNN'S PRESIDENTIAL
 TOWN HALL EVENT, STAY WITH US.

 WELCOME BACK TO CNN'S SPECIAL PRESIDENTIAL TOWN HALL
 EVENT.
 WE'RE IN MANCHESTER, NEW
 HAMPSHIRE.
 AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE TALKING WITH
 CALIFORNIA SENATOR KAMALA
 HARRIS.
 IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE.
 THANK YOU.
 I'M GOING TO BRING IN VANESSA
 CHAMBERS, A FRESHMAN STUDYING
 COMPUTER SCIENCE.
 FROM NEW ORLEANS.
 I WAS JUST IN NEW ORLEANS,
 ACTUALLY.
 MY QUESTION TALKS ABOUT HOW
 THIS COUNTRY PLANS TO ADMINISTER
 REPARATIONS TO THE DESCENDANTS
 OF FORMER SLAVES.
 IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED HEAVILY.
 GEORGETOWN JUST VOTED TO DEVOTE
 A PORTION OF THEIR STUDENTS'
 TUITION TO ADMINISTER
 REPARATIONS TO THE DESCENDANTS
 OF THE 272 SLAVES WHO WERE SOLD
 IN THE 19th CENTURY TO SAVE THE
 SCHOOL.
 HOWEVER, THIS IS BUT A SMALL
 STEP.
 HOW -- WHAT ACTIONS, WHAT
 SPECIFIC ACTIONS DO YOU PLAN TO
 TAKE TO ADMINISTER REPARATIONS
 FOR THIS UNPAID LABOR?
 SO I'M ACTUALLY SUPPORTING A
 BILL, THERE'S A CONGRESSWOMAN BY
 A NAME OF SHEILA JACKSON-LEE
 THAT'S WRITTEN THIS BILL OUT OF
 THE HOUSE TO STUDY EXACTLY THE
 RESPONSE TO YOUR QUESTION AND TO
 YOUR POINT AND TO SUPPORT YOUR
 POINT, LOOK, WE HAD CENTURIES OF
 SLAVERY IN THIS COUNTRY.
 WE HAD DECADES OF JIM CROW.
 WE HAD LEGALIZED DISCRIMINATION
 AND SEGREGATION.
 AND THEN WE HAD DE FACTO
 DISCRIMINATION AND SEGREGATION.
 AND TO BELIEVE OR SUGGEST THAT
 THOSE YEARS OF TREATMENT AND
 ABUSE AND VIOLENCE AND CRIMES
 DID NOT HAVE AN IMPACT IS TO
 OVERLOOK THE FACTS OF HISTORY.
 AND FOR THAT REASON I SUPPORT
 THE LEGISLATION.
 AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO THINK
 ABOUT SPECIFICALLY WHAT IT MEANS
 IN TERMS OF THE NEXT STEPS.
 BUT I THANK YOU FOR THAT
 QUESTION.
 SENATOR, YES OR NO, DO YOU
 SUPPORT FINANCIAL REPARATIONS?
 I SUPPORT WE STUDY THAT.
 LET'S LOOK AT THIS, FOR EXAMPLE.
 ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT IS VERY
 CLEAR IS THAT TRAUMA, YEARS OF
 TRAUMA OR EVEN ONE EXPERIENCE
 WITH TRAUMA CAN LEAD TO LIFELONG
 CONSEQUENCES.
 I'M SUPPORTING SOME WORK,
 PARTISAN WORK THAT STARTED YEARS
 AGO OF LOOKING AT CHILDREN WHO
 ARE GROWING UP IN A COMMUNITY
 WHERE THERE IS VIOLENCE AND IF
 YOU LOOK AT THE ASSOCIATED THEN
 PHYSICAL HEALTH EFFECTS
 ASSOCIATED WITH EXPOSURE TO
 TRAUMA AND WHAT THAT CAN MEAN IN
 TERMS OF PHYSICAL DISABILITY,
 NOT TO MENTION WHAT IT MEANS IN
 A CHILD'S ABILITY TO LEARN AND
 BE EDUCATED THERE ARE REAL
 SSOCIATED WITH TRAUMA.
 WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THEâ– â– 
 EXPERIENCED BECAUSE OF SLAVERY,
 BECAUSE OF JIM CROW AND ALL
 WE'VE SEEN IN TERMS OF
 INSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL
 DISCRIMIATION AND RACISM, THIS
 IS VERY REAL AND IT NEEDS TO BE
 STUDIED AND WE NEED TO LOOK AT
 HOW EXACTLY THE RESPONSE SHOULD
 BE PLAYED OUT AND HOW IT SHOULD
 WORK.
 I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU THAT
 A BIG VOTING BLOC IN THE
 DEMOCRATIC PARTY, BLACK
 AMERICANS, WHAT'S YOUR AGENDA
 FOR BLACK AMERICA?
 A NUMBER OF THINGS, FIRST OF
 ALL, WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THE
 ECONOMIC STATUS OF
 AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN THIS
 COUNTRY WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT IN
 TERMS OF EVERYTHING FROM HOME
 OWNERSHIP TO WAGES.
 WE CAN SEE HUGE DISPARITIES.
 AND SO THAT NEEDS TO BE
 ADDRESSED.
 LET'S LOOK AT AN ISSUE LIKE
 MAT
 MATERNAL MORTALITY.
 I AM PRESENTING WHAT I BELIEVE
 SHOULD BE THE RESPONSE TO THAT.
 I HAVE STUDIED THIS ISSUE.
 BLACK WOMEN ARE THREE TO FOUR
 TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DIE IN
 CONNECTION WITH CHILDBIRTH.
 WHEN YOU STUDY THE ISSUE IT
 BECOMES CLEAR IT IS REGARDLESS
 OF THE SOCIO ECONOMIC STATUS, IT
 WAS A MATTER OF RACIAL BIAS IN
 THE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM.
 THOSE WOMEN ARE NOT TAKEN AS
 SERIOUSLY WHEN THEY SHOW UP AT
 THE CLINIC OR THE DOCTOR'S
 OFFICE OR THE HOSPITAL.
 I'M LOOKING AT IT IN TERMS OF
 BEING A PROUD MEMBER AND
 GRADUATE OF AN HBCU, HOWARD
 COMPUTER, WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO
 SUPPORT OUR HBCUs.
 I HAD A PIECE OF LEGISLATION
 THAT'S ACTUALLY BEEN PASSED TO
 INVEST FEDERAL RESOURCES IN PPO
 RECOGNIZING THAT HBCUs PRODUCE
 IN SOME PROFESSIONS THE MAJORITY
 OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS THIS THOSE
 PROFESSIONS.
 THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ISSUES,
 INCLUDING WHAT WE NEED TO REFORM
 THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.
 THIS IS A FASCINATING
 QUESTION THAT YOU'LL FIND,
 COMING FROM DIANA DING, A JUNIOR
 AT HARVARD, STUDYING COMPUTER
 SCIENCE FROM SAN FRANCISCO.
 HI, SENATOR, THANK YOU FOR
 TABING MY QUESTION.
 THANK YOU.
 YOU HAVE SUPPORTED LEGALIZING
 SEX WORK, HOW WILL YOU ENSURE
 SEX WORKERS ARE DOING THIS WORK
 BECAUSE THEY WANT TO AND NOT
 BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO OPPORTUNITY
 TO DO OTHER WORK GIVEN THAT SEX
 WORKERS OFTEN COME FROM
 MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES.
 WHAT I DON'T SUPPORT IS
 CRIMINALIZING THESE WOMEN.
 MY BACKGROUND, AS YOU KNOW, I
 WAS A PROSECUTOR.
 WHEN I WAS DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF
 SAN FRANCISCO I INSTITUTED A
 NUMBER OF POLICIES THAT WERE
 FOCUSED ON WOMEN AND CHILDREN
 AND HOW THEY WERE TREATED
 FRANKLY WITH BIAS IN THE
 CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WHERE
 THEY WERE CRIMINALIZED WITHOUT
 REALLY LOOKING AT THE REAL
 OFFENDER AND SO OFTEN THAT CASE
 WAS THE PIMPS AND JOHNS, SO
 WOMEN WERE ARRESTED AS BEING
 PROSTITUTES.
 I CREATED POLICIES SAYING WE
 NEED TO FOCUS ON THE OTHER FOLKS
 AND NOT JUST ON THE WOMEN.
 I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR AN
 INITIATIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO THAT
 WAS ABOUT RECOGNIZING THAT GIRLS
 WHO ARE BEING TRAFFICKED WEREâ– ]
 PRS.â– â– â– â– â– â– â– @
 WHEN, IN FACT, T THE
 VICTIMS OF AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT
 OF ABUSE AND HAD BEEN
 TRAFFICKED.
 AND SO I CREATED A WHOLE POLICY
 IN SAN FRANCISCO THAT WAS, ONE,
 INTENDED TO STOP CALLING THEM
 TEENAGE PROSTITUTES, BUT INSTEAD
 TO CALL THEM SEXUALLY EXPLOITED
 YOUTH.
 AND BECAUSE OF THE WORK THAT WE
 DID WE THEN CREATED A SAFE HOUSE
 FOR THESE YOUNG WOMEN SO THAT
 INSTEAD OF THEM BEING ARRESTED
 AND PUT IN JUVENILE HALL THEY
 WOULD BE IN A SAFE HOUSE AND
 THEN WE WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR
 ACTUALLY GETTING LEGISLATION
 PASSED THAT SAID THAT WHEN THOSE
 JOHNS AND PIMPS ARE PROSECUTED
 THEY SHOULD BE PROSECUTED IN
 CONNECTION WITH THE SALE OF A
 CHILD, AGAIN LOOKING AT WHAT WE
 NEED TO DO TO FIGURE OUT WHO'S
 DOING WHAT.
 AS IT RELATES TO WOMEN WHO ARE
 BEING TRAFFICKED I WAS ONE OF
 THE LEADERS IN THE COUNTRY WITH
 MANY OTHERS IN SAYING THAT BACK
 PAGE NEEDED TO BE PUT OUT OF
 BUSINESS BECAUSE THEY WERE IN
 THE BUSINESS OF BASICALLY
 ALLOWING THE TRAFFICKING, IN
 PARTICULAR OF UNDERAGE GIRLS.
 SO THIS IS SOMETHING I HAVE HAD
 A LIFELONG EXPERIENCE WITH.
 INCLUDING WHAT WE NEED TO GO
 AFTER THOSE WHO TRAFFIC GIRLS
 AND WOMEN AND BOYS.
 WE SHOULD ALSO BE CLEAR ABOUT
 THAT.
 AND I TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLY.
 BUT WE SHOULD NOT BE
 CRIMINALIZING WOMEN WHO ARE
 ENGAGED IN CONSENSUAL, YOU KNOW,
 OPPORTUNITIES FOR EMPLOYMENT.
 BUT WE SHOULD DEFINITELY BE
 CAREFUL AND BE SURE THAT THEY
 ARE NOT BEING TRAFFICKED OR
 ABUSED IN ANY WAY.
 OUR NEXT QUESTION, SENATOR,
 COMES FROM MARGARET McSHERRY, A
 JUNIOR STUDYING POLITICS,
 ORIGINALLY FROM MASSACHUSETTS,
 MARGARET.
 HELLO, SENATOR, A QUESTION
 FOR YOU.
 AS TENSIONS GROW BETWEEN THE
 UNITED STATES IN NATIONS LIKE
 RUSSIA AND NORTH KOREA WHAT
 SHOULD BE DONE TO PREPARE THE
 NATION POSSIBILITY OF
 CYBERWARFARE?
 THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION, I'M
 SO GLAD YOU ASKED IT.
 IT'S REALLY -- IT'S BEEN
 CHALLENGING.
 I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT IN
 THE UNITED STATES SENATE.
 I SERVE ON THE SENATE HOMELAND
 SECURITY COMMITTEE.
 I SERVE ON THE SENATE
 INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE.
 YOU KNOW, NEWS FLASH, RUSSIA
 INTERFERED IN THE ELECTION OF
 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
 STATES.
 AND, IN FACT, ON THAT POINT
 ABOUT CYBERSECURITY, ONE, IT IS
 REAL.
 WHEN WE TALK ABOUT NATIONAL
 SECURITY, TO YOUR POINT, A NEW
 FORM OF WAR, WE SHOULD
 UNDERSTAND, WILL BE CYBERATTACKS
 AND CYBERATTACKS CAN TAKE A
 NUMBER OF FORMS BUT USUALLY TO
 OUR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE.
 WE'VE ALREADY SEEN ONE.
 YOU KNOW WHAT, UNDER THE
 PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION OUR
 ELECTION SYSTEM WAS DESIGNATED
 AS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE,
 RIGHT?
 SO WE ALREADY KNOW THAT WE HAVE
 BEEN ATTACKED IN TERMS OF OUR
 ELECTIONS.
 WE SHOULD ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT
 WE ARE VULNERABLE IN TERMS OF
 OUR ELECTRICAL GRIDS.
 WE ARE VULNERABLE IN TERMS OF
 ALL OF THE SYSTEMS THAT HOLD
 TOGETHER OUR FINANCIAL SYSTEMS,
 THAT HOLD TOGETHER OUR MEDICAL
 CARE SYSTEMS.
 AND WE HAVE GOT TO PAY GREATER
 ATTENTION.
 I HAVE A BILL THAT IS A
 BIPARTISAN BILL THAT IS DESIGNED
 TO STRENGTHEN STATES ELECTION
 SYSTEMS FROM -- TO PREVENT THE
 NEXT ATTACK.
 IT'S A BIPARTISAN BILL.
 AND THE LEADER IN THE UNITED
 STATES SENATE WILL NOT PUT IT ON
 THE FLOOR FOR A VOTE.
 AND THIS WILL BE TO OUR
 COLLECTIVE PERIL WHEN PEOPLE
 PLAY POLITICS WITH AN ISSUE
 THAT'S TRULY ABOUT OUR
 VULNERABILITY AS A COUNTRY.
 I WORKED ON THIS ISSUE WHEN I
 WAS ATTORNEY GENERAL.
 I WAS ATTORNEY GENERAL OF
 CALIFORNIA FOR TWO TERMS AND A
 LOT OF WORK WE DID THERE WAS
 ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE WERE
 FOCUSED ON THE VULNERABILITIES
 THAT WE HAVE BECAUSE OF
 TECHNOLOGY.
 AND DOING WHAT WE CAN TO PROTECT
 IT.
 AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
 STATES I WILL TELL YOU THAT WILL
 BE ONE OF MY NUMBER ONE ISSUES
 BECAUSE AS FAR AS I THINK ABOUT
 IT, YOU KNOW, WE'RE USED TO, AND
 WE PREPARE FOR WAR BECAUSE WE
 SHOULD AND WE SHOULD MAKE SURE
 THAT WE'RE READY IN THE EVENT
 OF -- WELL, THIS WILL BE A WAR
 WITHOUT BLOOD.
 AND WE ARE NOT PREPARED.
 AND WE MUST BE.
 BUT WE CANNOT BE IN DENIAL AND
 THIS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
 STATES IS IN UTTER DENIAL ABOUT
 THE REALITIES.
 FROM THE VULNERABILITIES OF
 OUR CYBERSYSTEM TO THE
 VULNERABILITIES NOW OF CHILDREN,
 SOMETHING I KNOW THAT'S
 IMPORTANT TO YOU.
 I WANT TO BRING IN NICOLE
 CINDERS, A STUDENT AT HARVARD, A
 MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG.
 YOU RECENTLY MENTIONED YOU
 WERE GRANTED THE TRUANCY LAW.
 ARE THERE ANY OTHER LAWS OR
 POLICIES THAT YOU REGRET AS A
 PROSECUTOR AND WHAT ACTIONS, IF
 ANY, WOULD YOU TAKE TO REMEDY
 THIS AS PRESIDENT?
 LET ME BE CLEAR.
 I ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE THAT
 CHILDREN HAVE AND SHOULD BE
 THOUGHT OF TO HAVE A
 CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO AN
 EDUCATION, PERIOD.
 SO THE TRUANCY INITIATIVE THAT
 YOU'RE REFERRING TO WAS STARTED
 BY ME WHEN I WAS DA BECAUSE I
 TOOK A LOOK AT WHO THE HOMICIDE
 VICTIMS WERE WHO WERE UNDER THE
 AGE OF 25.
 PEOPLE WERE USED TO THESE YOUNG
 MEN BEING KILLED.
 AND I SAID WAIT A MINUTE,
 INSTEAD OF JUST RESPONDING WHEN
 THEY ARE KILLED WITH PUTTING
 MORE POLICE ON THE STREETS OR
 HAVING GANG ENFORCEMENT
 STRATEGIES, WHY AREN'T WE ASKING
 THE QUESTION OF WHO ARE THEY?
 I ASKED THAT QUESTION.
 WHO ARE THESE YOUNG MEN UNDER â– 
 BEING KILLED?
 AND I QUICKLY LEARNED THAT 94%
 OF THEM WERE HIGH SCHOOL
 DROPOUTS.
 I THEN LOOKED CLOSER INTO THE
 ISSUE AND LEARNED OF THE
 CHRONICALLY AND HABITUALLY
 TRUANT STUDENTS UP TO 40% OF
 THEM WERE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
 STUDENTS, MISSING 50, 60, UP TO
 80 DAYS OF AN 180 DAY SCHOOL
 YEAR.
 I DECIDED TO TAKE THE ISSUE ON.
 AND I TOOK THE ISSUE ON FOR A
 NUMBER OF REASONS.
 ONE, UNDERSTANDING IN AN
 ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TRUANT IS
 THREE TO FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY
 TO BE A HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUT.
 70% OF THE PRISONERS IN THE
 UNITED STATES ARE HIGH SCHOOL
 DROPOUTS.
 AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN A HIGH
 SCHOOL DROPOUT, IS TWO-THIRDS
 LIKELY TO BE IN JAIL OR DEAD.
 I TOOK THE ISSUE ON, WHAT WE'VE
 GOT TO DO IS PAY ATTENTION TO
 THE FACT THAT THESE CHILDREN
 AREN'T IN SCHOOL AND PUT ALL THE
 RESOURCES NECESSARY TO GET THEM
 IN SCHOOL.
 AND GIVE THEIR PARENTS THE
 RESOURCES, HOLD THE SCHOOL
 DISTRICTS ACCOUNTABLE, WHY
 AREN'T THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS
 RAISING THE ALARM AND PUTTING
 ALL THE RESOURCES POSSIBLE INTO
 GETTING THESE KIDS TO SCHOOL
 EVERY DAY?
 AND AS A RESULT OF OUR
 INITIATIVE, FIRST OF ALL, NOBODY
 WENT TO JAIL.
 AND AS A RESULT OF OUR
 INITIATIVE WE IMPROVED
 ATTENDANCE BY OVER 30%.
 AND TO PUT A FINE POINT ON THIS,
 WHEN WE LOOK AT THE ISSUE OF
 EDUCATION AND OUR CHILDREN NO
 CHILD SHOULD BE OVERLOOKED.
 AND THIS IS WHAT THE SYSTEM
 DOES, GUYS, FOR CERTAIN KIDS THE
 SYSTEM REALLY DOESN'T EXPECT
 MUCH FROM THEM.
 THAT IS A HARSH REALITY IN MANY
 PLACES.
 AND SO WHEN THEY'RE NOT SHOWING
 UP IN SCHOOL THE SYSTEM IS
 JUST -- KEEPS MOVING.
 AND I SAID THIS IS WRONG.
 LET'S PUT A SPOTLIGHT ON THIS
 ISSUE.
 AND LET'S DEAL WITH IT BECAUSE
 THESE CHILDREN HAVE A CAPACITY
 EQUAL TO ANY CHILD IN ANY OTHER
 SCHOOL DISTRICT.
 AND YOU CAN BEST BELIEVE THE
 COMMUNITY WHERE I WAS TALKING
 ABOUT, A LARGE PART OF THOSE
 COMMUNITIES HAD AN ANNUAL
 INCOME, HOUSEHOLD INCOME OF

 YOU THINK OF THE CHILDREN IN
 THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT HAD
 AN ANNUAL INCOME OF 150 OR

 YOU THINK THE ALARMS WOULD NOT
 HAVE BEEN RAISED IF THOSE
 CHILDREN HADN'T BEEN ATTENDING
 SCHOOL EVERY DAY, MUCH LESS
 MISSING UP TO 80 DAYS OF 180 DAY
 SCHOOL YEAR?
 THAT'S WHY I TOOK THAT ISSUE ON.
 ANOTHER ISSUE THAT I WANT TO
 TALK TO YOU ABOUT, THIS IS
 REALLY IMPORTANT, I'M NOT SURE
 IF YOU WERE WATCHING EARLIER,
 BUT SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS SAID
 THAT HE IS IN FAVOR OF FELONS
 BEING ABLE TO VOTE WHILE SERVING
 IN PRISON.
 HE WAS ASKED SPECIFICALLY ABOUT
 PEOPLE LIKE THE BOSTON MARATHON
 BOMBER, ALSO PEOPLE WHO ARE
 CONVICTED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT.
 AND HE SAID, THIS IS A QUOTE,
 THE RIGHT TO VOTE IS INHERENT TO
 OUR DEMOCRACY, YES, EVEN FOR
 TERRIBLE PEOPLE.
 DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT, SENATOR?
 I AGREE THAT THE RIGHT TO
 VOTE IS ONE OF THE VERY
 IMPORTANT COMPONENTS OF
 CITIZENSHIP.
 AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE
 SHOULD NOT BE STRIPPED OF
 NEEDLESSLY, WHICH IS WHY I HAVE
 BEEN A LONG ADVOCATE OF MAKING
 PEOPLE INFORMALLY INCARCERATED
 ARE NOT DENIED THE RIGHT TO
 VOTE.
 IN SOME STATES THEY'RE
 PERMANENTLY DEPRIVED OF THE
 RIGHT TO VOTE.
 POLICIES THAT GO BACK TO JIM
 CROW, POLICIES THAT GO BACK TO
 THE HEART OF POLICIES THAT HAVE
 BEEN ABOUT DISENFRANCHISEMENT,
 POLICIES THAT CONTINUE TODAY AND
 WE NEED TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY.
 PEOPLE WHO ARE IN --
 CONVICTED, IN PRISON, LIKE THE
 BOSTON MARATHON BOMBER, ON DEATH
 ROW, PEOPLE WHO ARE CONVICTED OF
 SEXUAL ASSAULT, THEY SHOULD BE
 ABLE TO VOTE?
 I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE THAT
 CONVERSATION.
 OKAY.
 ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.
 WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE WITH
 SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS, THIS TOWN
 HALL EVENT RIGHT HERE AFTER THIS
 BREAK.
 DON'T GO ANYWHERE.
                   Yes. In fact,d        these right here.
      Oh, I thought you guys        just did shipping.
        No we do printing,         packing, faxing,

 TECH: At Safelite AutoGlass,
    we really pride ourselves        on making it easy
  to get your windshield fixed.
  TEACHER: Let's turn in your         science papers.
 TECH VO: This teacher always    puts her students first.
      STUDENT: I did mine          on volcanoes.
   TEACHER: You did?! Oh, I     can't wait to read it.
   TECH VO: So when she had      auto glass damage...
       she chose Safelite.
   With Safelite, she could see   exactly when we'd be there.
 TEACHER: You must be Pascal.
       TECH: Yes ma'am.
  TECH VO: Saving her time...
          [HONK, HONK]          KIDS: Bye!
  TECH VO: ...so she can save       the science project.
          KIDS: Whoa!
  KIDS VO: â™ª Safelite repair,        Safelite replace â™ª
   Uh-oh, looks like someone's
    still nervous about buying           a new house.
       Is it that obvious?
            Yes it is.
 You know, maybe you'd worry less  if you got GEICO to help with
    your homeowners insurance.
 I didn't know GEICO could helps    with homeowners insurance.
               Yep, they've been doing it for years.
       What are you doing?
            Big Steve?
           Thanks, man.
           There he is.
    <i> Get to know GEICO and see</i>    <i> how much you could save on</i>
          <i> homeowners and</i>        <i> renters insurance.</i>
 WELCOME BACK HERE LIVE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE FOR A CNN SPECIAL
 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL TOWN
 HALL, AND WE WANT TO THANK
 SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS FOR BEING
 HERE.
 LET'S JUMP INTO THE QUESTIONS.
 BRING IN SAHIL, A SOPHOMORE AT
 HARVARD.
 HE'S SUPPORTING SENATOR BERNIE
 SANDERS.
 HI, SENATOR.
 HI, SAHIL.
 AS A FELLOW MIXED PERSON OF
 AFRICAN AND INDIAN DESCENT, HOW
 DOES OUR IDENTITY SERVE YOU AS
 PRESIDENT OF THIS COUNTRY?
 THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.
 WELL, YOU KNOW, THERE IS
 SOMETHING THAT I FEEL VERY
 STRONGLY ABOUT THIS MOMENT IN
 TIME.
 I THINK OF THIS AS BEING AN
 INFLECTION POINT IN THE HISTORY
 OF OUR COUNTRY.
 I THINK THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME
 FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS THAT IS
 REQUIRING ULL TO LOOK IN THE
 MIRROR, EACH ONE OF US AND
 COLLECTIVELY TO LOOK IN A MIRROR
 AND ASK A QUESTION.
 THAT QUESTION BEING WHO ARE WE?
 AND I BELIEVE PART OF THE ANSWER
 TO THAT QUESTION IS WE ARE
 BETTER THAN THIS.
 THE OTHER PART OF IT IS
 UNDERSTANDING THAT IN THIS
 INFLECTION MOMENT THERE ARE VERY
 POWERFUL VOICES IN OUR COUNTRY
 RIGHT NOW THAT ARE TRYING TO SOW
 HATE AND DIVISION AMONG US.
 AND WE NEED TO SPEAK MANY
 TRUTHS.
 THE VAST MAJORITY OF US HAVE SO
 MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT
 SEPARATES US AND I KNOW THAT TO
 BE TRUE.
 I KNOW IT TO BE TRUE BECAUSE
 I'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO MANY
 CULTURES, RIGHT, YOU GOT ME.
 RIGHT.
 THERE YOU GO.
 SO I KNOW IT TO BE TRUE.
 I KNOW IT TO BE TRUE BASED ON
 WHAT I CALL THE MINUTE OF THE
 NIGHT THOUGHT.
 SOME PEOPLE CALL IT THE 3:00 IN
 THE MORNING THOUGHT.
 OTHER PEOPLE CALL IT THE
 WITCHING HOUR, WHEN YOU WAKE UP
 IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WITH
 THAT THOUGHT THAT'S BEEN
 WEIGHING ON YOU.
 FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF US WHEN
 WE WAKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
 NIGHT THINKING THAT THOUGHT IT
 IS NEVER THROUGH THE LENS OF THE
 PARTY WITH WHICH WE'RE
 REGISTERED TO VOTE.
 FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF US WHEN
 WE WAKE UP THINKING THAT THOUGHT
 IT IS NEVER THROUGH THE LENS OF
 SOME SIMPLISTIC DEMOGRAPHIC A
 POLLSTER PUT US IN.
 FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF US WHEN
 WE WAKE UP THINKING THAT THOUGHT
 IT USUALLY HAS TO DO WITH ONE OF
 JUST A VERY FEW THINGS, OUR
 PERSONAL HEALTH, THE HEALTH OF
 OUR CHILDREN, OUR PARENTS, FOR
 SO MANY AMERICANS CAN I GET A
 JOB, KEEP A JOB, PAY THE BILLS
 BY THE END OF THE MONTH, RETIRE
 WITH DIGNITY, FOR OUR STUDENTS
 CAN I PAY OFF THOSE STUDENT
 LOANS?
 FOR SO MANY FAMILIES IN AMERICA,
 CAN I HELP MY FAMILY MEMBER GET
 OFF THEIR OPIOID ADDICTION?
 THE VAST MAJORITY OF US HAVE SO
 MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT
 SEPARATES US.
 AND WHILE THERE ARE THESE
 POWERFUL FORCES THAT ARE TRYING
 TO SOW HATE AND DIVISION AMONG
 US AND HAVE US POINT FINGERS AT
 EACH OTHER AND OH, YOU'RE THAT,
 AND I'M THIS, I SAY I'M NOT
 BUYING IT.
 I'M NOT BUYING IT.
 AND THAT'S HOW I THINK ABOUT MY
 EXPERIENCES.
 I KNOW HOW MUCH WE HAVE IN
 COMMON.
 AND RIGHT NOW OUR COUNTRY
 REQUIRES LEADERS AND THE TOP
 LEADER TO INSTEAD OF USING A
 MICROPHONE, IN A WAY THAT IS
 ABOUT FUELING THE FAN OF HATE,
 INSTEAD OF USING THE BULLY
 PULPIT OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
 UNITED STATES, IN A WAY THAT IS
 ABOUT TALKING ABOUT, WELL, ON
 BOTH SIDES THERE'SM MERIT.
 WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO HAS
 THROUGH PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND
 IDEALS, WE NEED LEADERSHIP THAT
 UNDERSTANDS THE VAST MAJORITY OF
 US HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON
 THAN WHAT SEPARATES US AND
 THEY'VE GOT TO STOP DIVIDING US.
 THAT'Sâ– 8â– 8 I RUNNING FOR
 PRESIDENT.
 THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS.
 LET'S TALK ABOUT DIVISION,
 AND I THINK THIS FALLS INTO THAT
 CATEGORY.
 YOU HAVE RECENTLY SAID IT WOULD
 BE A TRAP, IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE
 FOR DEMOCRATS TO FALL INTO A
 TRAP OF A CONVERSATION ABOUT
 WINNING BACK "THE GUY IN THE
 MIDWEST WHICH IS CODE," WHAT IS
 IT CODE FOR?
 THERE IS A CONVERSATION
 THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING AMONG MANY
 PEOPLE, INCLUDING PUNDITS, THAT
 SUGGEST -- I DON'T MEAN YOU.
 I DIDN'T THINK SO, BUT THANKS
 FOR CLARIFYING.
 I JUST MEANT ON TV.
 I'LL JUST KEEP DIGGING MYSELF
 INTO THIS.
 THINK WILL BE TALKING ABOUT MY
 PERFORMANCE TONIGHT, THOSE SAME
 PUNDITS.
 IN ANY EVENT THERE'S A
 CONVERSATION ALL OF US HAVE BEEN
 HEARING ABOUT -- ESPECIALLY THE
 2020 ELECTION, WHICH IS A
 CONVERSATION SAYING, OH, WHO CAN
 TALK TO THE PERSON IN THE
 MIDWEST?
 OH, WHO'S -- AND I REJECT THAT
 NOTION THAT YOU HAVE ONE
 CONVERSATION WITH SOMEONE IN THE
 MIDWEST AND ANOTHER CONVERSATION
 WITH SOMEBODY IN THE SOUTH AND
 ANOTHER CONVERSATION WITH PEOPLE
 WHO LIVE ON THE COAST.
 I REJECT THAT NOTION AND I THINK
 IT IS -- IT IS -- IT IS
 SHORTSIGHTED.
 AND IT IS ACTUALLY NOT CONNECTED
 WITH WHERE PEOPLE REALLY ARE.
 THE AMERICAN PUBLIC DON'T WANT
 THAT.
 THEY DON'T WANT THAT.
 SO THAT'S WHAT I MEANT BY THAT.
 ALL RIGHT.
 LET'S BRING IN KIMBERLY
 MORROW, A SENIOR STUDYING
 POLITICS WORKING FULL-TIME WHILE
 ATTENDING SCHOOL AT THE
 UNIVERSITY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE MAN
 GOOD EVENING, SENATOR.
 THROUGH MY STUDIES AS A POLITICS
 AND SOCIETY MAJOR AT UNH
 MANCHESTER I'VE LEARNED WOMEN IN
 OUR COUNTRY FACE VERY REAL
 INEQUALITIES.
 WHAT DO YOU PLAN TO DO AS
 PRESIDENT TO LEVEL THE PLAYING
 FIELD AND EMPOWER WORKING WOMEN?
 ON DAY ONE WE NEED TO PASS
 THE RA, THE EQUAL RIGHTS
 AMENDMENT.
 WE ALSO NEED TO SPEAK LOUDER
 ABOUT THE REALITIES OF THE
 FACTS, JUST AS YOU'VE DONE NOW
 AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR
 LEADERSHIP ON THIS.
 BECAUSE IT IS JUST SOMETHING
 THAT HAS TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED AND
 DEALT WITH.
 WOMEN ARE PAID ON AVERAGE 77% TO
 THE DOLLAR.
 AND THEN IF YOU LOOK AT
 AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN AND
 LATINAS, EVEN LESS FOR DOING THE
 SAME WORK.
 YOU LOOK AT THE FACT THAT WE
 HAVE A REAL BATTLE IN THIS
 COUNTRY AROUND MINIMUM WAGE AND
 THE NEED TO INCREASE MINIMUM
 WAGE.
 WE SHOULD UNDERSTAND MINIMUM
 WAGE IS AMIN MUM STANDARD OF
 LIVING BUT FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE
 IS $7.25 AVERAGING $15,000 A
 YEAR AND THEN THE MAJORITY OF
 WOMEN ARE MINIMUM WAGE WORKERS.
 LET'S LOOK AT THE ISSUE OF WHAT
 WE NEED TO DO AROUND DISPARITIES
 AROUND ISSUES LIKE CHILD CARE,
 UNDERSTANDING WOMEN ARE THE
 PRIMARY CAREGIVER TO CHILDREN
 AND YET WE DON'T HAVE A NATIONAL
 POLICY AROUND AFFORDABLE CHILD
 CARE, WHICH I AM A PROPONENT OF.
 WE NEED TO ALSO ADDRESS WHAT IS
 HAPPENING IN TERMS OF
 UNDERSTANDING THAT WOMEN'S
 ISSUES TO THE POINT OF BEING
 MARGINALIZED HAVE TO BE BROUGHT
 TO THE FOREFRONT AND WE SHOULD
 ALSO
 WHEN IN FACT THE REALITY IS WHEN
 YOU LIFT UP THE ECONOMIC STATUS
 OF WOMEN, YOU LIFT UP THE
 ECONOMIC STATUS OF FAMILIES AND
 COMMUNITIES AND ALL OF SOCIETY.
 THAT'S HOW I FEEL ABOUT THAT.
 MATTHEW SOLOMON IS FROM
 MASSACHUSETTS.
 A JUNIOR STUDYING POLITICS AND
 PEACE AND JUSTICE.
 HE'S ALSO THE PRESIDENT OF THE
 LGBTQ ALLIANCE.
 SO MY QUESTION IS IF ELECTED
 PRESIDENT, WHAT KIND OF
 PROTECTIONS, SPECIFIC
 PROTECTIONS WILL YOU BE
 EPROVIDING FOR THE LGBTQ PLUS
 COMMUNITY AND MEMBERS OF COLOR?
 SO I HAVE MY ENTIRE CAREER
 AND LIFE BEEN AN ALLY OF THE
 LGBTQ COMMUNITY AND I WILL SAY
 WE MUST HAVE A COUNTRY THAT
 AGREE NO GROUP SHOULD BE TREATED
 WITHOUT EQUALITY UNDER THE LAW.
 AND RIGHT NOW THAT IS THE CASE.
 ON DAY ONE WOULD PASS THE
 EQUALITY ACT TO MAKE SURE THAT
 WE ACTUALLY CORRECT WHAT IS
 WRONG AND GIVE LGBTQ PEOPLE
 EQUAL RIGHTS UNDER THE LAW.
 THIS IS A CIVIL RIGHTS AND HUMAN
 RIGHTS ISSUE.
 ER I WAS, AS ATTORNEY GENERAL,
 IT WAS ONE OF THE PIVOTAL ISSUES
 IN MY RACE TO BECOME ATTORNEY
 GENERAL.
 WHETHER OR NOT THE ELECTED
 ATTORNEY GENERAL WOULD DEFEND AN
 UNCONSTITUTIONAL LAW WHICH
 DENIES SAME-SEX COUPLES THE
 RIGHT TO MARRY.
 PROP 8 WENT TO THE UNITED STATES
 SUPREME COURT.
 WE WENT AND THE WEDDING BELLS
 RANG ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
 I'M VERY PROUD OF THAT.
 IN 2004 O, WHEN THE CHATTER
 AMONG A LOT OF DEMOCRATS WAS
 ABOUT CIVIL UNION, I WAS
 MARRYING SAME-SEX COUPLES AT SAN
 FRANCISCO CITY HALL.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 I WILL TELL YOU YOU'LL REMEMBER
 THE TRAGIC CASES INVOLVING
 TRANSGENDER MEN WHO WERE KILLED
 AND THERE WAS THIS DEFENSE THAT
 WAS HAPPENING IN COURT WHERE THE
 MURDER WAS ARE CALLING IT THE
 GAY PANIC DFLS.
 OH, I PANICKED BECAUSE HE WAS
 GAY AND THEREFORE SHOULD NOT BE
 CONVICTED OF MURDER.
 IT WAS HAPPENING AROUND THE
 MATTHEW SHEPHERD CASE.
 WHEN I WAS KNOWING THIS WAS
 HAPPENING, I BROUGHT DA'S FROM
 AROUND THE CURRENTRY TO SAN
 FRANCISCO WHERE I HOSTED AND
 CREATED A TRAINING FOR
 PROSECUTORED AROUND THE CAN
 COUNTRY ON HOW TO DEFEAT THE GAY
 PANIC DEFENSE.
 ON THE ISSUE OF TRANSGENDER
 ROI
 RIGHTS, RIGHT NOW IN PARTICULAR
 WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS
 REVIVING -- THE COURT SAID NO
 AND NOW WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO
 IS PUTTING IN PLACE A PROCESS
 FOR DISCHARGING TRANSGENDER MEN
 AND WOMEN WHO HAVE MADE
 COMMITMENT TO OUR COUNTRY AND TO
 DEFEND OUR DEMOCRACY AT GREAT
 SERVICE AND POTENTIAL SACRIFICE
 AND THIS PRESIDENT WANTS TO KICK
 THEM OUT OF THE MILITARY BECAUSE
 THEY ARE TRANSGENDER.
 IT IS ABOSOLUTELY UNCONSCIONABLE
 AND THAT IS SOMETHING I WOULD
 REVERSE IMMEDIATELY WHEN I AM
 ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
 STATES.
 I WANT TO BRING IN RACHEL, A
 SOPHOMORE AT HARVARD FROM CAN
 CO.
 COLORADO.
 THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS HAVE
 SEEN YOUNG PEOPLE GETTING
 INVOLVED IN POLITICS AND
 ACTIVISM, ORGSINIZING AROUND GUN
 CONTROL AND CLIMATE CHANGE.
 GIVEN THAT POLICIES WILL EFFECT
 PEOPLE FOR YEARS TO COME, DO YOU
 THINK AMERICANS HAVE A RIGHT TO
 VOTE AT AGE 16?
 I THINK THERE IS NO QUESTION
 IF WE ARE LOOKING AT WHAT IS
 GOING ON IN OUR COUNTRY, WE'RE
 PUTTING MORE RESPONSIBILITIES ON
 PEOPLE AT YOUNG AGE THE LARGERER
 NUMBER OF PEOPLE WE CAN INVOLVE
 IN THE ELECTORAL PROCESS, YI
 THINK THE MORE ROBUST IT WOULD
 BE.
 I THINK ONE OF THE DOWN SIDES
 BUT THANK YOU DO CNN FOR DOING
 THE TOWN HALL WITH STUDENTS IS
 IF THEY DON'T WRITE CHECKS, THEY
 DON'T GET HEARD.
 I BELIEVE STRONGLY YOU CAN JAUJ
 SOCIETY BASED ON HOW IT TREATS
 ITS CHILDREN.
 YOU CAN LOOK AT WHAT WE ARE NOT
 DOING FOR STUDENTS, TEENAGERS
 AND YOUNGER.
 AND I BELIEVE IF THEY HAD
 GREATER POLITICAL POWER, MAYBE
 WE WOULD GET OUR ACT TOGETHER
 BETTER THAN WE'VE BEEN DOING AND
 MAYBE THAT'S ONE OFF THE STEPS
 TOWARDS IT.
 AND WHAT I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT
 AND I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN HERE FOR
 LIKE FIVE HOURS, IS THAT ONE OF
 THE THINGS THAT IS SO -- THAT WE
 HAVE TO REMEMBER ABOUT THE
 HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, IT'S
 SOME OF THE GREATEST MOVEMENT
 THAT HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT CHANGE,
 SOCIAL CHANGE, ADVANCEMENT,
 PROGRESS HAVE BEEN FUELLED AND
 BORN FROM OUR STUDENTS.
 THANK YOU, SENATOR.
 SO WE WANT TO THANK SENATOR
 KAMALA HARRIS.
 THAT IS FOUR TOWN HALLS DOWN.
 ONE NEAR GO.
 WHEN WE COME BACK, ANDERSON
 COOPER IS GOING TO BE HERE.
