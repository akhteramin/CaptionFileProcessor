To say that it works in 3 days really is a big deal. <i>This is Charlie not coughing</i> <i>because he took Delsym 12-hour.</i> <i> And this is Charlie still not</i> <i> coughing</i> <i>while trying his hardest not to</i> <i>wake Zeus.</i> <i> Delsym 12-hour.</i> <i> Nothing lasts</i> <i> longer for powerful</i> <i> cough relief.</i> THE THINGS THAT MATTER MOST HAPPEN ONE MORNING AND ONE CUP AT A TIME. <i> You might take something</i> <i> for your heart...</i> <i> or joints.</i> HAPPEN ONE MORNING AND ONE CUP AT A TIME. <i> But do you take something</i> <i> for your brain.</i> <i> With an ingredient originally</i> <i> discovered in jellyfish,</i> <i> Prevagen has been shown</i> <i> in clinical trials</i> <i> to improve short-term memory.</i> <i> Prevagen.
