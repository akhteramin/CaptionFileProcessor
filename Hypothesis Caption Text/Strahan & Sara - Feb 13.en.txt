 WELCOME TO THE SHOW. WE HAVE GOT THE HILARIOUS ALI
 WENTWORTH TODAY.
 AND CARLA HALL IS HERE AS
 WELL.
 THERE SHE IS JUMPING IN THE
 BACKGROUND.
 PLUS WE HAVE SOME TRAILBLAZING
 DESIGNERS AS WELL.
 AND WE HAVE THE GREATEST
 AUDIENCE IN TELEVISION.
 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
 FROM THE CROSS ROADS OF THE
 WORLD, TIMES SQUARE, NEW YORK
 CITY, IT'S "STRAHAN AND SARA."
 ESCAPE FOR AN HOUR.
 WE ALL NEED IT.

 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
 OH.
 HAVE A SEAT.


 WELCOME TO THE SHOW, EVERYBODY.
 HAPPY HUMP DAY.
 HAPPY WEDNESDAY AND WE'RE
 EXCITED BECAUSE WE HAVE CARLA
 HALL HERE COOKING WITH US THIS
 MORNING.
 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
 I'M SO EXCITED TO BE HERE.
 THIS IS, LIKE, FIRST TIME IN THE
 NEW DIGS.
 I LIKE IT.
 WHAT ARE YOU MAKING FOR
 LUNCH?
 I'M MAKING A CHICKEN SALAD ON
 DARK BREAD WITH RAISINS AND
 OPEN-FACE JOHNNYCAKE SANDWICHES
 IN THE SHAPE OF A HEART.
 I KNOW IT'S THAT TIME OF YEAR.
 TODAY IS GALENTINE'S DAY.
 TODAY IS GALENTINE'S DAY.
 GALENTINE'S.
 THAT'S A PERFECTLY SHAPED
 SANDWICH FOR TODAY FOR ALL THE
 LADIES IN THE HOUSE.
 SO GALENTINE'S FOR THE GALS.
 IT'S A THING.
 THE 13th IS GALENTINE'S DAY
 AND THE 14th IS VALENTINE'S DAY.
 WHY DO THEY KEEP MAKING STUFF
 UP?
 WE HAVE SO MUCH TIME ON OUR
 HANDS.
 IT'S, LIKE, THE GIRL POWER DAY
 WHERE WE LIFT EACH OTHER UP.
 WHICH WE ALL NEED.
 IT'S GALENTINE'S AND
 VALENTINE'S.
 THEN THERE'S --
 LIKE MOST THINGS, WOMEN LIFT
 FIRST AND THEN THE MEN FOLLOW
 NEXT.
 FOR THE MALE, IT'S
 MALENTINE'S DAY.
 YEAH.
 PUT OUR FLAG DOWN.
 STAKE OUR CLAIM.
 I WANTED TO START OFF WITH
 THE CUTEST VIDEO THAT I SAW -I
 SAW IT ON "GMA."
 I OCCASIONALLY WATCH THAT SHOW.
 YOU'RE ON IT, RIGHT?
 YEAH, SOMETIMES.
 BUT THERE IS LITERALLY THIS
 DOG.
 THIS IS SO CUTE.
 IT'S IN AUSTRALIA NAMED MOLLY
 WHO UNFORTUNATELY LOST A LITTER
 OF PUPPIES.
 SO DAYS LATER, SHE ADOPTS A NEW
 BABY, A BABY POSSUM.
 MOLLY AND HER NEW BABY LIKE TO
 SLEEP TOGETHER.
 THEY PLAY TOGETHER AND TAKE LONG
 WALKS TOGETHER.
 LOOK AT THEM.
 I MEAN IT'S CUTE NOW.
 IT'S ADORABLE.
 IT'S ADORABLE, AND I GET IT,
 YOU KNOW, I JUST DON'T
 UNDERSTAND HOW IT'S GOING TO BE
 LATER ON BECAUSE MY
 UNDERSTANDING IS THE DOG WAITS
 UNDER THE THE TREE EVERY DAY FOR
 THE POSSUM TO COME BACK AND COME
 DOWN AND GET ON ITS BACK AND IT
 GIVES HIM A RIDE, BUT, YOU KNOW,
 POSSUMS, THEY GET OLDER.
 MAYBE A LITTLE MORE AGGRESSIVE.
 I WOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT RABIES
 AND THEN A POSSUM ON YOUR POOR
 DOG'S BACK, THAT COULD BE BAD
 FOR THE BACK.
 THIS WAS SUCH A JOYFUL,
 BLISSFUL STORY THAT I FEEL WAS,
 LIKE, JUST POOPED ON.
 I'M JUST SAYING.
 CARLA, IS IT NOT SO CUTE?
 OKAY.
 IT IS CUTE, BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN,
 WHEN I SAW THE VIDEO, I'M, LIKE,
 THAT'S A RAT ON THAT DOG'S BACK.
 AND THEN ONE DAY --
 YOU HAVE BEEN IN NEW YORK FOR
 TOO LONG.
 WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE DOG
 DECIDES TO COME IN THE HOUSE
 WITH THE POSSUM ON THE BACK?
 THAT'S ANOTHER PROBLEM.
 WELL, YEAH.
 IT'S MORE OF AN OUTDOOR DOG AND
 POSSUM, BUT IT'S SO CUTE.
 CROSS-SPECIES LOVE DEFIES HUMAN
 NATURE.
 IT'S CUTE FOR YOU NOW.
 I'LL GIVE YOU THAT.
 IT'S SUPER ADORABLE.
 THE AUDIENCE AGREES.
 THEY DON'T AGREE.
 THEY DO.
 THERE WAS AN INTERVIEW WITH
 KATY PERRY.
 SHE IS OPENING UP ABOUT LIVING
 WITH HER BOYFRIEND, ORLANDO
 BLOOM.
 YES.
 PHYSICALLY THE FACT THAT SHE
 THROWS SOME OF HIS THINGS OUT
 WHEN HE'S NOT LOOKING.
 I MEAN THE MOMENT YOU LEAVE THE
 HOUSE, STUFF GOES IN THE TRASH.
 NOW SHE SAID SHE WARNED HIM
 ABOUT THIS ONCE, AND SHE ADMITS
 THAT THEY ARE BOTH HOARDERS BY
 NATURE DUE TO ALWAYS WORRYING
 ABOUT MONEY GROWING UP AND NOT
 HAVING ENOUGH AND NOW THAT THEY
 HAVE THINGS, THEY JUST KEEP IT.
 SHE SAYS, MY GARAGE IS NOT FULL
 OF CARS.
 IT'S YOU FULL OF STUFF.
 CLOTHES OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE.
 CLOTHES.
 DO YOU THROW OR HAVE YOU
 THROWN SOME OF YOUR HUSBAND'S
 STUFF AWAY WHEN THEY ARE NOT
 LOOKING?
 NO BECAUSE I'M THE ONE WITH
 TOO MUCH STUFF.
 THERE WAS A PAIR OF CARGO PANTS
 THAT I MISS ALREADY THAT MY
 BROTHER, MY BEST FRIEND AND MY
 HUSBAND WERE SO DISGUSTED BY
 THAT THEY ONCE PLOTTED AND
 REMOVED THOSE PANTS FROM THE
 HOUSE AND I HAVEN'T SEEN THEM
 SINCE.
 I'M GOOD SOMETIMES OF TAKING
 A FEW HOURS AND PURGING THE
 CLOSET AND GRABBING EVERYTHING.
 SEE WHAT SPARKS YOUR JOY?
 YEAH.
 AND I PUT IT IN THE BAGS TO GET
 RID OF IT, BUT THEN I PUT THE
 BAG BY THE DOOR AND IT SITS
 THERE FOR, LIKE, A MONTH.
 YES.
 WHO SHOULD I GIVE IT TO?
 WHO CAN WEAR MY SIZE?
 THAT'S HALF THE PROBLEM.
 NOT MANY PEOPLE, BUT YOU CAN
 CUT IT INTO A FEW PIECES FOR US.
 CARLA, HAVE YOU EVER DONE
 THAT?
 HAVE YOU EVER HAD IT DONE FOR
 YOU?
 YOU HAD A MAGAZINE FROM 2008
 IN YOUR HOUSE.
 I DID.
 I FOUND A MAGAZINE FROM 2008 AND
 ONE FROM 2013.
 WHAT I HEAR YOU ALL SAYING IS
 PEOPLE ARE THROWING YOUR STUFF
 AWAY BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SPARK
 JOY FOR THEM.
 RIGHT.
 SUPER SELFISH.
 THAT IS WRONG.
 A MAGAZINE FROM 2008, THAT'S
 KIND OF PUSHING JOY FROM
 EVERYBODY.
 CARLA IS A HOARDER.
 I'M A HOARDER.
 HI.
 I'M CARLA, I'M A HOARDER.
 CARLA, KEEP COMING BACK.
 I'M A HOARDER.
 YOU'RE ADMITTING MAYBE YOU'RE
 WRONG IN KEEPING THE MAGAZINE.
 CORRECT.
 THAT LEADS US INTO OUR NEXT
 STORY.
 HOW TO OWN BEING WRONG.
 OKAY.
 THERE WAS A RECENT ARTICLE.
 SEE HOW I DID THAT?
 SHE TOTALLY OWNED IT.
 OWNED IT.
 IT WAS IN "THE HARVARD
 BUSINESS REVIEW," WHICH I READ
 AS LIGHT READING SOMETIMES.
 [ LAUGHTER ]
 IT WAS ENTITLED "WHAT TO DO WHEN
 YOU REALIZE YOU HAVE MADE A
 MISTAKE."
 NOW THE ARTICLE POINTS OUT THAT
 FOR MANY OF US, FINDING OUT THAT
 WE WERE WRONG CAN FEEL LIKE A
 THREAT TO OUR SELF-IDENTITY AND
 IT GIVES THIS QUOTE FROM THE
 BOOK, BEING WRONG ADVENTURES IN
 THE MARGIN OF ERROR.
 OUR LOVE OF BEING RIGHT IS BEST
 UNDERSTOOD AS OUR FEAR OF BEING
 WRONG.
 THAT'S DEEP.
 I MEAN, HOW MANY OF YOU GUYS
 KNOW -BECAUSE THEY'RE PROBABLY
 IN YOUR FAMILY, BUT YOU DON'T
 HAVE TO NAME THEM, THOSE PEOPLE
 THAT NEVER APOLOGIZE, THAT ARE
 NEVER WRONG?
 DO YOU KNOW SOMEONE?
 MICHAEL, WE DIDN'T ASK YOU IF
 YOU DO IT, BUT -BECAUSE -SO
 THE WHOLE POINT IS THIS WAS THE
 HELPFUL ADVICE.
 IT'S ONE OF THE FEW THINGS I'M
 GOOD AT.
 I'M QUICK TO APOLOGIZE.
 I THINK I KNEW PEOPLE SOMEWHERE
 ALONG THE WAY THAT DIDN'T.
 I'M GOOD AT IT.
 ARE YOU APOLOGIZING BECAUSE
 YOU'RE WRONG OR BECAUSE YOU
 FEEL, LIKE, YOU KNOW --
 THIS IS THE KEY.
 THE FIRST TIP IS TAKE
 RESPONSIBILITY.
 MICHAEL SAID EARLIER, I SAY I'M
 SORRY WHEN I'M JUST TIRED OF
 TALKING ABOUT IT.
 WHOA.
 SO BASICALLY YOU'RE SORRY THAT
 THEY'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT IT.
 SO PRETTY MUCH HE JUST,
 LIKE -HE PETERS OUT.
 I'M GETTING SICK OF TALKING
 ABOUT THE SAME THING 100 TIMES.
 LIKE, OKAY.
 OBVIOUSLY WE'RE NOT AGREEING.
 HEY, I'M SORRY.
 LET'S MOVE ONTO THE NEXT THING
 TO APOLOGIZE ABOUT.
 THIS IS A TIP.
 HELP ME OUT HERE.
 HOW CAN I GET BETTER?
 TAKE RESPONSIBILITY.
 DON'T SAY, MISTAKES WERE MADE OR
 I'M SORRY YOU'RE OFFENDED OR I'M
 TIRED OF TALKING ABOUT THIS.
 I ADDED THAT PART.
 OKAY.
 TAKE RESPONSIBILITY.
 THEN IT SAYS
 ADDRESS WHAT YOU NEED TO DO
 RIGHT NOW AND SHARE WHAT YOU
 WILL DO DIFFERENTLY NEXT TIME.
 OH.
 I WILL APOLOGIZE SOONER.
 I MEAN, NO.
 YOU DO REMEMBER THE TITLE WAS
 HOW TO OWN YOU'RE WRONG?
 I CAN OWN WHEN I'M WRONG.
 I CAN REALLY OWN WHEN I'M WRONG.
 I DO APOLOGIZE, BUT THERE ARE
 TIMES WHEN I JUST DON'T FEEL
 LIKE I AM WRONG.
 IT'S OKAY.
 BUT THE OTHER PERSON DOESN'T
 EITHER AND YOU GET FATIGUED AND
 I'M READY TO MOVE ON.
 I THINK I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO
 IS GUILTY OF APOLOGIZING WHEN
 YOU DON'T NECESSARILY FEEL LIKE
 YOU'RE WRONG.
 YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE?
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 AND YOU KNOW HOW I KNOW I'M NOT
 ALONE IN THIS?
 BECAUSE THE YOUNG MAN IN THE
 FRONT ROW LOOKED AT HIS GIRL AND
 DID, LIKE, THIS AND THEN LOOKED
 AT ME, LIKE, MICHAEL, DON'T LOOK
 AT ME.
 DON'T LOOK AT ME.
 SHE'S LOOKING AT ME.
 I LIKE THAT THE FIRST PERSON
 WHO CLAPPED WAS RORY OUR BOSS.
 HE'S, LIKE, AMEN.
 I AGREE.
 APOLOGIZE WHEN YOU ARE WRONG.
 YOU HAVE GOT TO OWN IT.
 NOT THE WAY MICHAEL DOES.
 EXHIBIT "A."
 EXHIBIT "A."
 BUT THIS MOTHER IS OWNING WITH
 HER DAUGHTER.
 THEY ARE OWNING BLACK HISTORY
 MONTH, AND HER NAME IS SASHA.
 SHE IS IN NORTH CAROLINA.
 THAT'S THE MOTHER'S NAME AND SHE
 HAS BEEN DOING A SPECIAL PROJECT
 ON INSTAGRAM WITH HER DAUGHTER
 IN HONOR OF BLACK HISTORY MONTH.
 THIS IS SO CUTE.
 EACH DAY SHE POSTS A PICTURE
 OF HER DAUGHTER -NAMED RILEY,
 DRESSED AS A DIFFERENT ICONIC
 BLACK WOMAN.
 HERE ARE JUST A FEW.
 THERE SHE IS AT BEYONCE.
 HERE SHE IS FROM "BLACK
 PANTHER."
 AND ALSO.
 MY FAVORITE.
 WHOOPI.
 WHOOPI FROM "SESAME STREET."
 WE LOVE THAT.
 WE REACHED OUT TO SASHA AND THIS
 IS WHAT SHE TOLD US.
 VERY, VERY GOOD THING.
 SHE SAID, MY INTENTIONS WERE
 SOLELY JUST TO EDUCATE MY BABY.
 I WANT HER TO KNOW SHE CAN BE
 AND DO ANYTHING IN LIFE WHEN SHE
 GETS A LITTLE OLDER.
 SHE WILL KNOW ALL THESE WOMEN,
 WHO THEY ARE AND SHE WILL SEE
 HERSELF IN THEM AND KNOW THAT
 THERE IS NO LIMIT TO THE THINGS
 SHE CAN DO.
 WELL DONE, SASHA.
 WELL DONE.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 GREAT JOB.
 THAT STORY IS PERFECTION.
 YOU KNOW WHAT'S PERFECTION?
 WHEN WE COME BACK, WE'RE GOING
 TO TALK ABOUT LOVE AND
 RELATIONSHIPS WITH ALI
 WENTWORTH, EVERYBODY.
 YEAH.
 WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

 WE GOT IT ALL.
 LUNCHTIME AT 1:00 EASTERN,
 12:00 CENTRAL AND PACIFIC ON
 ABC.
 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

 TOMORROW IS VALENTINE'S DAY
 SO I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE IN OUR
 AUDIENCE ARE FILLED WITH
 QUESTIONS ABOUT ROMANCE AND
 RELATIONSHIPS.
 AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE
 SITTING UP HERE.
 SO AS A PUBLIC SERVICE, WE
 BROUGHT IN ONE OF THE WISEST
 PEOPLE WE KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO
 RELATIONSHIPS.
 YES.
 WISEST.
 OR REALLY JUST ABOUT ANY
 TOPIC.
 IF YOU ARE CONFUSED OR CURIOUS,
 YOU CAN ALWAYS ASK ALI.
 THAT'S RIGHT.
 PLEASE WELCOME ALI WENTWORTH.
 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
 HELLO.
 HELLO, HELLO.
 I'M SO EXCITED TO BE HERE.
 IN CASE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW,
 ALI WENTWORTH IS THE BETTER HALF
 OF THE GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS AND
 ALI WENTWORTH MARRIAGE.
 YES.
 I'M VERY OPEN ABOUT THAT.
 I'M THE SERIOUS, SMART ONE.
 SERIOUS, SMART ONE RIGHT
 HERE, YES.
 I'M SURE A LOT OF THIS ADVICE
 COMES FROM YOUR ADORABLY PERFECT
 MARRIAGE WITH GEORGE.
 YES.
 I'M JUST SAYING THAT BECAUSE
 HE'S ON ABC.
 YES.
 I DO WHAT HE SAYS AND WE HAVE A
 PERFECT MARRIAGE.
 HE DIDN'T EVEN SAY THAT WAS
 THE WAY IT WENT.
 HE IS CUTE AND WELL-TRAINED.
 HE IS.
 HE SAYS, YOU MAKE THE
 DECISIONS.
 LIKE A PUPPY.
 I DO PUSH HIS NOSE IN IT A
 LITTLE.
 BUT, YOU KNOW, I LOVE TO GIVE
 ADVICE BECAUSE MY MOTHER IS A
 BIG ADVICE GIVER.
 NOT GOOD ADVICE, YOU KNOW.
 SHE'S, LIKE, YOU'RE DEPRESSED?
 CLOSE YOUR EYES AND THINK ABOUT
 CHRISTMAS.
 THAT KIND OF THING AND REMEMBER
 I HAD JUST GIVEN BIRTH.
 MY HAIR WAS, LIKE, MATTED TO MY
 FACE AND THEY HAD TAKEN THE BABY
 AND GEORGE WENT TO GET ME HONEY
 NUT CHEERIOS AND SHE WAS, LIKE,
 IT WOULDN'T HURT YOU TO PUT LIP
 GLOSS ON BEFORE GEORGE COMES
 BACK.
 I WAS, LIKE, I JUST HAD A BABY.
 AS I GOT OLDER, I STARTED TO
 REALIZE WITH MY TEENAGE GIRLS,
 I'M GOING TO START GIVING
 ADVICE.
 I KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT A FEW
 THINGS AND I HAVE A NETWORK OF
 GIRLFRIENDS AND THAT'S WHERE WE
 GET OUR ADVICE AND HERE IT IS,
 VALENTINE'S DAY AND I GET A LOT
 OF LOVE QUESTIONS FROM MY
 FRIENDS.
 I'M CONSTANTLY TRYING TO SET
 THEM UP, AND I KNOW THAT OUR
 AUDIENCE HAS SOME QUESTIONS,
 RIGHT?
 YES.
 YEAH, THEY DO.
 LET'S BRING UP OUR FIRST ONE.
 I'M EXCITED.
 WHAT IS YOUR NAME AND WHAT'S
 YOUR QUESTION?
 I'M CALLAN ALEXANDER FROM
 SANTA CRUZ, CALIFORNIA.
 MY QUESTION FOR YOU GUYS TODAY
 IS -SO.
 I MET A GUY ONLINE AND WE HAVE
 BEEN DATING FOR ABOUT FOUR
 MONTHS NOW, AND I WAS WONDERING
 WHEN THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO
 HAVE A DISCUSSION OF DELETING
 PROFILES IS.
 WHEN YOU SAY ONLINE IS IT,
 LIKE, THE DARK WEB OR A DATING
 APP?
 WHEN PEOPLE SAY ONLINE, I'M
 JUST, LIKE, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
 WHICH PART OF IT.
 THE IT'S THE WILD WEST OUT
 THERE.
 ON YOUR USUAL SWIPING APPS.
 PET FINDER.
 WHAT I NEED TO BE ON.
 HERE'S MY ADVICE TO YOU.
 I SAY -IS IT A HIM OR A HER OR
 A THEY?
 HIM.
 A HIM.
 I WOULD LET HIM TAKE CONTROL OF
 THAT.
 IF YOU SEE ONE DAY THAT HE SAYS
 IN A RELATIONSHIP AND FINGERS
 CROSSED IT'S YOU, THEN YOU CAN
 DO THE SAME THING, BUT DON'T BE
 THE FIRST -DON'T BE THE PERSON
 TO DO THAT.
 DO YOUR SHOPPING AROUND.
 I THINK FOUR MONTHS, IT
 DEPENDS ON WHAT YOUR
 RELATIONSHIP IS LIKE.
 FOR ME IF IT'S, LIKE, TIGHT AND
 YOU FEEL LIKE THERE IS SOMETHING
 THERE, BUT I DON'T KNOW IF I
 WOULD NECESSARILY BE THE FIRST
 ONE.
 WOMEN ARE MORE PROACTIVE
 NOWADAYS.
 SOMETIMES IT GETS A LITTLE
 SCARY FOR THE MEN IF WE'RE,
 LIKE, PUT A RING ON IT AFTER
 DINNER THE FIRST TIME.
 SHE'S AN INDEPENDENT WOMAN.
 SHE DOESN'T NEED TO DECLARE HER
 RELATIONSHIP STATUS.
 I MET MY HUSBAND ONLINE AND
 HE SAID TO ME A FEW MONTHS IN, I
 JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW, I DON'T
 WANT TO MEET ANYONE ELSE RIGHT
 NOW SO I'M GOING TO TAKE MINE
 DOWN.
 I WAS STILL A SINGLE LADY SO
 LIKE ALI SAID, I WAS FLYING
 LOOSE.
 LADY.
 [ LAUGHTER ]
 ALL RIGHT.
 THANK YOU.
 SHE'S PREGNANT.
 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
 WE NEED TO GET AWAY FROM THAT.
 WHERE DID THAT COME FROM,
 ALI?
 PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE NOT
 FLYING LOOSE LIKE THIS ONE.
 NO, NO, NO.
 WHAT YOU GOT?
 I'M BRIAN SULLIVAN FROM NEW
 JERSEY AND I HAVE A QUESTION FOR
 YOU GUYS.
 I'M A SINGLE GUY IN MY MID 30s
 AND GOD HELP ME.
 I WORK BRUTAL 13-PLUS HOUR DAYS.
 HOW DO I FIND THE TIME TO MEET
 ANYONE?
 OKAY.
 THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.
 WHAT DO YOU DO FOR A LIVING?
 I'M IN SHOW BUSINESS.
 OH.
 WELL -THIS IS A FRIENDSHIP
 RING.
 I WOULD SAY IT'S HARD TO MEET
 PEOPLE AT WORK NOW BECAUSE OF
 THE WHOLE ME TOO MOVEMENT.
 I WOULD GET ON THE APP THAT THE
 NICE WOMAN EARLIER WAS ON.
 I WOULD TRY TO MEET SOMEBODY
 ONLINE.
 ONLINE.
 THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN
 DO IT.
 OKAY.
 DON'T LET YOUR MAMA SET YOU
 UP.
 I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW THAT'S
 NOT GOING TO WORK OUT.
 YOU SEEM LIKE A GREAT GUY.
 I HOPE YOU'RE NOT A SERIAL
 KILLER.
 I'M NOT.
 TALK TO THAT BEAUTIFUL BLONDE
 ABOUT WHAT APP SHE'S ON.
 OKAY.
 I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GRINDR
 OR EHARMONY, BUT SHE'LL TELL
 YOU.
 THANK YOU, BRIAN.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 HELLO.
 HI.
 I'M TERESA FROM HOUSTON, TEXAS.
 HI.
 TERESA.
 YES.
 SO AS A MOM AND A WIFE, I AM
 CONSTANTLY JUGGLING EVERYTHING
 AND MY QUESTION TO YOU IS, HOW
 DO YOU FIND BALANCE IN IT ALL
 AND STILL MAKE TIME FOR YOUR
 FRIENDS AND OTHER IMPORTANT
 RELATIONSHIPS BESIDES THOSE?
 I PUT MY FRIENDS WAY AHEAD OF
 MY FAMILY.
 NO.
 YOU KNOW WHAT?
 THE TRUTH IS I'M VERY
 DOMESTICATED LIKE A CAT AND WHAT
 I DO IS I MAKE -WE HAVE FAMILY
 DINNER EVERY NIGHT.
 I HAVE TWO TEENAGE GIRLS.
 SO YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW MUCH
 XANAX I'M POPPING, BUT WITH MY
 FRIENDS WHO I DON'T GET TO SEE A
 LOT, WE HAVE A TEXT --
 A TEXT CHAIN.
 #SQUAD AND ALL WE DO IS GO,
 OH MY GOD.
 I'M FEELING REALLY SAD AND
 THAT'S A WAY TO CONNECT VERY
 QUICKLY WITHOUT HAVING TO GO OUT
 AND HAVE DRINKS WITH THEM.
 ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE LIKE SARA
 AND DRINK ALONE.
 FLY LOOSE.
 ALL ALONE.
 SET UP A GIRLFRIEND CHAT AS A
 WAY TO FEEL CONNECTED TO THEM.
 I HAVE THAT WITH THE GUYS.
 WE HAVE A GUY CHAT.
 OH, YOU DO?
 LOOK AT YOU.
 #HOT.
 #SQUAD.
 #BOYSONLY.
 MINE IS #DLINE.
 IT'S THE DEFENSIVE LINE FROM
 BACK WHEN I PLAYED IN THE NFL.
 THAT'S NOT WHAT OUR SQUAD IS.
 ALL RIGHT.
 ALL RIGHT.
 MY TWO CENTS --
 I HAVE FEELINGS TOO.
 I DON'T THINK YOU EVER FEEL
 BALANCE AND IF YOU EVER ERR ON
 THE SIDE OF -EAR MUFFS, ALI,
 FAMILY FIRST, YOU CAN'T GO
 WRONG, BUT I DON'T THINK IT EVER
 FEELS BALANCED.
 OKAY.
 NEW YORK C
 NO, IT DOESN'T, BUT THE
 GIRLFRIENDS ARE JUST AS
 IMPORTANT AS EVERYTHING ELSE.
 THAT'S WHERE I --
 SUPER INTENSIVE.
 YOU SHOULD PUT THE -TAKE
 CARE.
 UNTIL THEY'RE, LIKE, 11.
 THANK YOU.
 WE HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION.
 ONE MORE QUESTION.
 OKAY.
 HELLO.
 HI, GUYS.
 SO I HAVE BEEN DATING SOMEONE
 WHO LIVES OUT OF STATE FOR A
 COUPLE OF MONTHS NOW SO MY
 QUESTION IS HOW DO I KEEP THINGS
 SPICY?
 I THINK BEING OUT OF STATE IS
 SPICY ENOUGH.
 HERE'S MY ADVICE TO YOU.
 I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW.
 DON'T SEND SEXY PICS OR NUDIES.
 NO.
 DON'T DO IT.
 THEY LIVE FOREVER.
 THEY LIVE FOREVER AND YOUR
 GRANDCHILDREN ARE GOING TO BE
 DOING YOUR EULOGY AND THEY ARE
 GOING TO COME UPON ALL THIS
 STUFF AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE
 GOOD.
 KEEP IT SPICY VERBALLY, BUT THE
 FACT THAT YOU GUYS ARE LONG
 DISTANCE, LIKE, GEORGE AND I
 WERE LONG DISTANCE AT THE
 BEGINNING OF OUR RELATIONSHIP
 AND THAT WAS SPICY ENOUGH
 BECAUSE YOU GET SO EXCITED TO
 SEE THE PERSON.
 HOW OFTEN DO YOU SEE HIM?
 SO FAR --
 HAVE YOU MET HIM?
 OF COURSE.
 JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE HE'S
 NOT A CATFISH.
 NO.
 HE HAS TRAVELED UP HERE AND I
 HAVE TRAVELED DOWN SOUTH SO
 MAYBE ABOUT FOUR TIMES SO FAR.
 THAT'S GOOD.
 THAT'S SPICY.
 THAT'S SPICY.
 DO SOMETHING CUTE FOR
 VALENTINE'S DAY.
 BUT NOT ON YOUR PHONE.
 OKAY.
 THANK YOU.
 THANK YOU.
 THANK YOU.
 AND GOOD LUCK IN LOVE, EVERYBODY
 AND IN BALANCE AS WELL.
 ALI, THANK YOU.
 YOU'RE THE BEST.
 I LOVE GIVING OUT ADVICE.
 I TELL YOU WHAT.
 IF YOU WANT MORE ADVICE FROM
 ALI, YOU CAN GET A COPY OF HER
 BOOK.
 IT'S CALLED "GO ASK ALI."
 WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH FASHION
 TRAILBLAZER BRANDICE DANIEL.
 WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

       I'm a close talker.
  So I was excited about All-New  Colgate Total.
  Its breakthrough formula does  more...
            Wonderful.
     Sensitivity, strengthens     teeth...
 It kills germs through my whole mouth..
     I like your confidence.
         Thanks Mr. Lee!
 Now there's no such thing as too close.
          Yes, there is.
         No, there's not.
          Yes there is.
         No, there's not!
              Okay.

 So there you are with your depression
 and your dirty laundry that you just don't want to deal with.
 Because depression is multiple symptoms.
 Yeah, time for a change.
 And your doctor tells you about TRINTELLIX,
 a prescription medicine for depression.
 So you're feeling this overall relief.
 And TRINTELLIX had no significant impact on weight
 in clinical trials.
 You got this.

 OUR NEXT GUEST IS FASHION
 TRAILBLAZER AND OWNER OF
 HARLEM'S FASHION ROW WHICH IS
 PARTNERED WITH NIKE AND LeBRON
 JAMES AND IT WAS PART OF NEW
 YORK'S FASHION WEEK.
 PLEASE GIVE A WARM WELCOME TO
 BRANDICE DANIEL.
 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
 HI.
 WELCOME.
 THANK YOU.
 I'M SO EXCITED TO BE HERE.
 SO NICE TO SEE YOU.
 HARLEM'S FASHION ROW, HOW DID
 YOU COME UP WITH THIS IDEA?
 HOW WAS IT BORN?
 I WAS LIVING IN HARLEM AT THE
 TIME AND HAD AN IDEA THAT I
 WANTED TO DO A SHOW FEATURING
 BLACK DESIGNERS IN HARLEM.
 NO ONE KNEW ME.
 I WAS A TOTAL FASHION OUTSIDER.
 I'M FROM MEMPHIS, BUT I KEPT
 GOING TO PEOPLE AND
 CONVINCING THEM TO BE APART OF
 THIS, AND WHEN I RESEARCHED AND
 FOUND THAT AFRICAN-AMERICANS
 SPENT OVER $22 BILLION A YEAR,
 BUT REPRESENT LESS THAN 1% OF
 DESIGNERS IN MAJOR DEPARTMENT
 STORES, I KNEW I WANTED TO BE A
 SOLUTION.
 AND A SOLUTION YOU ARE, AND
 IT REALLY IS AMAZING BECAUSE WE
 LOOK BACK AT BLACK HISTORY MONTH
 AND WE LOOK BACK AT EVERYTHING
 IN THE PAST, BUT WE ALSO NEED TO
 LOOK FORWARD TO TRAILBLAZERS
 LIKE YOURSELF AND WHAT YOU ARE
 DOING IN THE COMMUNITY.
 I APPLAUD YOU FOR THAT.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 AND YOU MADE HISTORY BECAUSE
 YOU DESIGNED THIS LeBRON JAMES
 16 SNEAKER WHICH WAS THE FIRST
 LeBRON SIGNATURE SHOE DESIGNED
 BY WOMEN FOR WOMEN.
 YES.
 THAT IS, LIKE, WOW.
 IT SOLD OUT IN FIVE MINUTES.
 WHAT WAS IT LIKE SEEING THIS
 COME TO FRUITION?
 LOOK.
 I'M STILL DIGESTING THIS.
 IT STILL FEELS LIKE A DREAM, BUT
 I REMEMBER WHEN ME AND THE
 DESIGNERS WENT INTO NIKE'S
 OFFICES FROM DAY ONE.
 THEY SHOWED THE DESIGNERS SO
 MUCH RESPECT AND THERE WAS A
 POINT IN TIME WHERE THE
 DESIGNERS, THEY WERE, LIKE, IN A
 ZONE AND I LOOKED AT THEM AND I
 WAS, LIKE, THIS PROJECT IS GOING
 TO BE SPECIAL.
 THEN WE GOT TO SHOW THE SHOE TO
 LeBRON, AND WHILE WE'RE SHOWING
 HIM THE SHOE, ONE OF THE
 DESIGNERS SAID, LeBRON, THIS
 SHOE IS AMAZING, BUT WHAT'S EVEN
 MORE AMAZING IS THE FACT THAT ME
 AND THESE OTHER TWO DESIGNERS
 HAVE COME TOGETHER AND FORMED A
 SISTERHOOD AND THAT WE REALLY
 HAVE LEARNED THAT COLLABORATION
 IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN
 COMPETITION.
 AND HE SAID, THAT'S THE STORY I
 WANT TO TELL.
 GOOD FOR LeBRON.
 THAT MAKES ME LOVE IT MORE.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 YEAH.
 I THINK THAT WAS AMAZING AND THE
 SHOES ARE ONLY AVAILABLE FOR
 WOMEN.
 COLLABORATE ON SIZE 14s.
 NOW IT'S TIME -WE'RE GOING TO
 SEE SOME OF YOUR DESIGNERS.
 THEY'RE GOING TO SHOW THEIR
 DESIGNS, BUT FIRST WE HAVE LOOKS
 FROM UNDRA CELESTE.
 SO UNTRA CELESTE IS A
 DESIGNER FOR THE EVERYDAY WOMAN
 WHO WANTS A LITTLE BIT OF EDGE
 AND LOVE POPS OF COLOR.
 THIS PARTICULAR COLLECTION, THE
 BRIGHT SIDE WAS RECENTLY SHOWN
 IN NEW YORK FASHION WEEK.
 SOMEHOW HER PIECES MANAGED TO
 MAKE YOU FEEL HAPPY AND FIERCE
 AT THE SAME TIME.
 YES.
 I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE DOES
 THAT.
 LOVE IT.
 WE HAVE A COUPLE MODELS.
 WE'LL HAVE THEM COME OUT.
 AND THE COLOR.
 THE COLOR MAKES YOU HAPPY.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 YES.
 THE KALEIDOSCOPE FRINGE DRESS
 HAS BEEN AN ABSOLUTE FAVORITE.
 THAT DRESS IS ABSOLUTELY A SHOW
 STOPPER AND THIS IS HER BEST
 SELLER.
 THIS IS THE JOY DRESS.
 SHE BRINGS IT OUT EVERY SEASON
 IN DIFFERENT COLORS.
 IT'S ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL ON ALL
 BODY TYPES.
 ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE IT
 EMBRACES CURVY WOMEN AND I'M
 CURVY AND THAT'S THE KIND OF
 THING I WANT.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 AND WE HAVE THE DESIGNER HERE,
 UNDRA CELESTE, NEW YORK.
 WELCOME, UNDRA.
 THANK YOU.
 THANK YOU.
 TELL US WHAT INSPIRED THIS
 LINE.
 THIS COLLECTION, THE BRIGHT
 SIDE WAS INSPIRED BY MY FAMILY,
 THE WOMEN IN MY FAMILY I SHOULD
 SAY.
 THEY CAME TO -MY FAMILY IS
 FROM THE WEST INDIES AND THEY
 CAME HERE LOOKING FOR A BETTER
 LIFE AND WORKED IN A LOT OF
 DOMESTIC CAPACITIES WHEN THEY
 FIRST GOT HERE, BUT ON THE
 WEEKENDS, LIKE, THESE WOMEN, SIX
 SISTERS, WOULD TRANSFORM AND I
 THINK THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE
 THEM IS THEY WOULD TRANSFORM
 INTO, LIKE, DONNA SUMMERS AND
 DIANA ROSS.
 SO, YOU KNOW, ALTHOUGH THEIR
 WEEKS WEREN'T THAT BRIGHT, THEIR
 WEEKEND WAS THE BRIGHT SIDE.
 THEY GOT TOGETHER AND CAME
 TOGETHER AS SISTERS, OVERDRESSED
 FOR EVERYTHING THAT THEY WENT TO
 AND I WAS REALLY -I ACTUALLY
 WENT BACK AND LOOKED AT OLD
 PHOTO ALBUMS AND PICTURES OF
 THEM.
 THEY WERE FIERCE.
 THEY WERE AMAZING.
 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
 THANK YOU.

 SO MUCH.
 THANK YOU SO MUCH.
 YOU KNOW, NEXT WE HAVE FE NOEL.
 NOW THE FE KNOLL COLLECTION
 HONESTLY JUST MAKES ME WANT TO
 LUXURIATE ON A BEACH.
 IT'S SO REGAL YET RELAXED.
 HER CLOTHES HAVE A WAY OF I
 THINK MAKING WOMEN FEEL LIKE
 GODDESSES WHILE DOING HER
 EVERYDAY CHORES.
 AND NOW, SARA, AS A MOM, YOU
 WILL LOVE HER PIECES.
 YOU WILL FEEL GLAMOROUS WHILE
 YOU'RE CHANGING DIAPERS.
 YES.
 AND HERE ARE OUR MODELS.
 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
 SO ELEGANT.
 YES.
 AND SO THIS IS A PRINTED CHIFFON
 DRESS.
 I'M SORRY.
 THIS IS A ROBE HERE.
 THE ROBE WITH WIDE-LEGGED PANT.
 THIS IS SO CUTE.
 AND THIS IS A BELT HERE.
 IT IS BEAUTIFUL.
 IT WILL JAZZ UP EVERY OUTFIT,
 AND WE HAVE THE DESIGNER HERE
 WITH US.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 WE HAVE TO KNOW WHAT INSPIRED
 THIS, LIKE, LUXURIATING ON THE
 BEACH LOOK.
 SO I'M FROM A CARIBBEAN
 BACKGROUND AND THIS COLLECTION
 IS INSPIRED BY MY MOTHER.
 SHE CAME FROM A CARIBBEAN ISLAND
 CALLED GRENADA AND SHE CREATED A
 BEAUTIFUL LIFE FOR HERSELF, SO I
 WANTED TO PAY HOMAGE TO HER BY
 DESIGNING A COLLECTION THAT
 SHOWED HOW I VIEWED HER AS A
 QUEEN, BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
 I'M A NEW MOM AND I WANTED TO BE
 COMFORTABLE AND LOOSE AND FLOWY.
 I UNDERSTAND.
 TELL YOU WHAT.
 EVERYBODY COME ON OUT.
 COME ON OUT.
 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
 WE CAN'T GET OUT OF HERE
 WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE DESIGNERS
 AGAIN.
 WE WANT TO TELL YOU THAT YOU CAN
 FIND MORE OF THESE GREAT
 FASHIONS AT
 HARLEMSFASHIONROW.COM.
 AMAZING JOB, EVERYBODY.
 THANK YOU SO MUCH, BRANDICE.
 COMING UP, WE HAVE INCREDIBLE
 ART MADE FROM KISSES.

       In terms of treating           sensitivity,
      3 days is really fast.
           The dentist  is going to be able to provide
      that to their patients.
   Sensodyne Rapid Relief in my    opinion is a game changer.
   It's going to let the dentist        offer their patient
   sensitivity relief in 3 days.
       It has a formulation
   that lays down a barrier of
 protection against sensitivity.
   Within 3 days, say over the       course of a weekend
  you're going to start feeling       significant results.
 To say that it works in
 3 days really is a big deal.

 WELCOME BACK.

 USES A VERY UNUSUAL MEDIUM FOR
 HER WORK.
 TAKE A LOOK.

 WOW.
 PLEASE WELCOME ALEXIS FRASER,
 AKA LIPSTICK LEX.
 THANK YOU.
 THANK YOU.
 SO HAPPY TO BE HERE.
 THANK YOU SO MUCH.
 HOW DO YOU FIGURE OUT YOU
 COULD DO THIS?
 TO DO THIS?
 YEAH.
 LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THAT.
 SO I USED TO BE, LIKE, A NORMAL
 ARTIST.
 I USED TO PAINT WITH REGULAR,
 TRADITIONAL MATERIALS AND IT WAS
 BACK IN 2006 I WAS WORKING WITH
 A LOT OF OILS AND ACRYLICS AND I
 WAS ALSO DABBLING IN A LOT OF
 UNCONVENTIONAL METHODS BECAUSE I
 WANTED TO DIFFERENTIATE MYSELF
 IN THE WORLD OF ART.
 I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING
 DIFFERENT AND I WAS DABBLING IN
 ALL THESE UNCONVENTIONAL METHODS
 AND AT THAT TIME, I HAD SOMEBODY
 CHALLENGE ME.
 IF YOU CAN DO ALL THIS OTHER
 UNCONVENTIONAL STUFF,
 COULD YOU DO A PORTRAIT OF
 MARILYN MONROE IN A WAY THAT
 INCORPORATES MARILYN MONROE
 WITHOUT USING PAINTS?
 I WAS, LIKE, OH.
 I HAD A PRETTY GOOD
 BRAINSTORMING SESH, AND I
 THOUGHT, WHAT IF I MADE MARILYN
 OUT OF LIPSTICK AND MY KISSES
 BECAUSE SHE WAS SO ICONIC FOR
 BLOWING KISSES.
 I HAD NO IDEA IF IT WOULD WORK,
 AND IT DID, AND I LOVED IT AND
 MY HUSBAND WORK LOVED IT.
 CAN YOU SHOW US?
 ABSOLUTELY.
 HERE'S A PIECE THAT I'M WORKING
 ON RIGHT NOW.
 THIS PART, THE KISS FOR
 VALENTINE'S DAY, WAS ALL
 HAND-PAINTED WITH LIPSTICK, BUT
 THIS PART RIGHT HERE,
 I LEFT A LITTLE TAPE ON HERE
 BECAUSE THIS IS LOOKING LIKE IT
 NEEDS A COUPLE MORE KISSES.
 FEW KISSES SHY OF A PAINTING.
 EXACTLY.
 I'M GOING TO PUT ON MY LIPSTICK
 AND JUST KISS THE CANVAS.
 SO THEN I TAKE OFF MY TAPE AND
 THEN --
 VOILA.
 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
 VOILA.
 CAN YOU SHOW US HOW TO DO IT?
 YES.
 OF COURSE.
 I REALLY WANT TO SEE HOW THIS
 IS DONE.
 I HAVE NEVER PUT ON LIPSTICK.
 WELL, THERE'S A FIRST TIME
 FOR EVERYTHING.
 YEAH.
 THIS IS GOING TO BE INTERESTING.
 WHAT COLORS ARE WE GOING FOR?
 BLACK.
 YOU ARE EDGY.
 GIRL.
 WHEN YOU SEE AN OPPORTUNITY --
 THAT'S SO CUTE.
 THAT'S SO CUTE.
 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

 WHAM, BAM.
 THERE WE GO.
 YEAH.

 YOU WENT FOR THE BLACK ROSE.
 I'M GOING FOR, LIKE,
 LOVE/HATE OF A ROSE.
 THAT'S PERFECT FOR
 VALENTINE'S DAY.
 WHAT WERE YOU WORKING ON?
 I SAW YOUR PORTRAIT.
 SARA --
 SAMESIES.
 BUT YOU NEVER HAVE SOMEBODY
 DO A KISS PORTRAIT OF YOU
 BEFORE.
 SO HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY.
 YOU DID A PORTRAIT OF US?
 YES.
 YES.
 IS THIS IT?
 LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
 YOU'RE LAUGHING AT MY LIPS, BUT
 I CAN'T HELP IT.
 DRUM ROLL, PLEASE.
 LOOK HOW CUTE WE ARE.
 WOW.
 HOW DID YOU GET THE GAP?
 WITH EXTRA TAPE?
 THAT IS AMAZING.
 THAT IS GORGEOUS.
 THANK YOU.
 IT'S AMAZING.
 THAT IS SO BEAUTIFUL.
 OH, BOY.

 THE COLOR OF YOUR TV.
 YES, I AM WEARING LIPSTICK.

 CHUNKY, YOU'RE GOING TO MIX THAT
 UP, OKAY?
 LIKE WITH A FORK?
 YEAH.
 WITH A FORK.
 HERE'S A TIP FOR YOU.
 SO WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO KEEP
 YOUR AVOCADOS GREEN OR YOUR
 GUACG
 GUACAMOLE --
 I NEED TO KNOW THIS.
 MINE BROWN.
 ADD THE PITS.
 WHAT THE PIT IS DOING IS
 COVERING THE SPACE WHERE THE
 AVOCADO IS.
 BUT IF YOU TAKE A PIECE OF
 PLASTIC AND JUST PRESS RIGHT
 ONTO THE AVOCADO, THEN THAT WILL
 BE DELICIOUS TOO.
 WE'RE GOING TO LET THOSE COOK.
 HERE WE HAVE SOME RIGHT HERE.
 OKAY.
 THAT'S WHAT THAT'S GOING TO LOOK
 LIKE ONCE I STAMP THEM OUT.
 WE'RE GOING TO PUNCH THEM
 OUT.
 WE HAVE THE LOVE RIGHT HERE.
 MICHAEL, WE'RE GOING TO TAKE
 SOME MUSTARD.
 WE TAKE OUR HAM AND WE'RE GOING
 TO PUT THAT ON THERE.
 IS MUSTARD THAT EXCITING?
 I KNOW.
 IT'S EXCITING, AND WHILE YOU'RE
 OVER THERE, I'M GOING TO CUT
 SOME EGGS.
 SARA, CAN I HAVE YOUR KNIFE?
 I'M GOING TO SHE YOU A TRICK.
 WHERE IS THAT KNIFE, SARA?
 I COULDN'T GET IT OFF.
 WE DIDN'T COVER THAT.
 I'M GOING TO CUT THE EGGS,
 SPRAY MY KNIFE.
 THIS IS A LITTLE TRICK.
 WITH A LITTLE BIT OF OIL, AND
 THE YOLK DOES NOT --
 YOU SPRAY THE KNIFE.
 OH.
 I WAS WONDERING HOW YOU DID
 THAT.
 YES.
 YES.
 THEN WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR EGG
 AND PUT IT ON HERE.
 SARA, WHAT WHAT ABOUT PUTTING
 GUACAMOLE ON HERE?
 ARE YOU EATING ALREADY?
 NOPE, NOPE, NOPE.
 YOU CAN BE.
 YOU CAN BE EATING ALREADY.
 WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS.
 PUT SOME MORE EGG ON TOP.
 EGG ON THERE.
 PUT YOUR EGG ON TOP, YEAH.
 THAT LOOKS SO GORGEOUS.
 THANK YOU.
 THANK YOU.
 EGG ON TOP.
 CAN I THROW SOME CHIVES?
 CHIVES.
 YOU WANT TO BE SALT BAE,
 MICHAEL.
 NO.
 I'M KIND OF --
 THIS IS SO GOOD, AND WHAT I
 LOVE ABOUT THIS, MIX UP YOUR
 OPENED-FACE SANDWICHES AND IT'S
 DELICIOUS.
 IT'S VERY DELICIOUS AND I
 TELL YOU RIGHT NOW.
 WE'RE GOING TO EAT AND WE'LL BE
 RIGHT BACK, EVERYBODY.
