Thank you. -You know, just gather around quietly. Come on. Now, just stand by. Here he is now. Say, Fats, a bunch of the kids would like to listen to you blowin' up a storm. Would you let them listen in? -Well, as a rule we don't do it. But for the kids, I'm more than glad. -Hooray. -[Music] I like the way you walk [Music] [Music] I like to hear you talk [Music] [Music] Let me hold your hand [Music] [Music] And try to understand [Music] [Music] I want a girl like you [Music] [Music] Tell my trouble to [Music] [Music] Don't be afraid [Music] [Music] You've heard what I said [Music] MAN: Fats, how'd this rock 'n' roll all get started, anyway? -Well, what they call rock 'n' roll now is rhythm and blues. I've been playin' for 15 years in New Orleans. [Music] I love you the best [Music] [Music] Let the four winds blow [Music] -NARRATOR: A native son of New Orleans, Fats Domino would pioneer the big beat sound and become one of the world's most beloved entertainers. [Instrumental] Antoine Domino, Jr., arrived on February 26, 1928, delivered by a midwife with the assistance of his grandmother, Carmelite, who had been born into slavery. Antoine Jr. was the last of eight Domino children and the only one to be born in New Orleans. -MAN: The -
- the neighborhood that Fats Domino grew up in is called the Lower Ninth Ward in New Orleans. And it's arguably where a lot of the best musicians came from. And it's a part of the city that enjoys a reputation in New Orleans for being... That's the -
- the heart, really, the heartbeat of the city. -MAN: It was almost like another, uh, world, like another world. There was always talk about... When you talked about the Lower Ninth Ward, you talk as if the people who lived down there didn't have as much goin' on as the people mid-city. Of course, some of the people who lived down there had a lot goin' on. -DOMINO: I was born on Jourdan Avenue down here in the Ninth Ward. They said I was born in a house at 1939 Jourdan Avenue. Thank you. Thank you very much. I went to a school right down the street here. It was about 10 blocks from here, McCartey School. And then I remember years ago when I used -
- used to come home from school. My mom used to be cooking, um, on a wood stove. And sometimes I got from school, uh, and I had to cut wood that evening. Another thing I remember when I lived on Jourdan Avenue, I used to pick iron and copper in the street, Jourdan Avenue, I used to live on. The street was so bad, the holes were so big they used to get stuff from the cotton bale and -
- and and fill the street up with nothin' but tin and iron. That -
- that's the way Jourdan Avenue was. And I used to sell it to -
- sell the scrap. If you made your 20 cents or 25 cents livin'... That was a lot of money, 25 cents, in that time. -When he got out and about, he was, uh, roamin' the streets of the Ninth Ward. And he would love to pick up things that he'd see. And sometimes he'd sell 'em to the junkman who, uh, ironically, would become part of the song The Junker's Blues that he'd later record. His life was changed, basically, when his sister married Harrison Verrett, who was a, uh, relatively well-known New Orleans musician who played banjo. -DOMINO: My brother-in-law Harrison used to play with Papa Celestin Band. You know, and, uh, one time I went to the French Quarter, and I heard them play out there several times. That's where I really learned from my brother-in-law, Harrison Verrett. He had a lot of patience. He would take... He -
- he just loved bein' with children, you know? And that's what I loved about him. -COLEMAN: Fats had always played around on the family piano since they had bought it. First of all, they put it out in the garage to keep him from, uh, drivin' them crazy a little bit. But he even quit school because he wanted to play the piano so much. And, uh, so he only went to the fourth grade. Harrison actually taught him how to play it. And he put the notes on the piano on pieces of tape. And it was a beat-up piano. You could actually see the metal through the -
- the ivory. But, uh, Fats, you know, got some sound out of it. -DOMINO: We had an upright piano in the house. He'd teach me the chords, the foundation. If you know how to play the chord, he'd write the chord down to you. And you play this famous song, playin' in the band, just by the chord. And after I learnt that, that's when I just went on my own. Everybody had a piano. I used to stop. And the -
- the manager said, Where's Fats at? His son would say... His son was Willie. Willie'd say, I don't know. Say, Well, you got a piano over there. You better go look. He might be where you left the piano. Where the piano at, where Fats at. -COLEMAN: From the late '30s to the '40s, Fats started listening more to jukeboxes. That's basically the way that blacks heard music in those days because not a lot of 'em had record players. There was no radio that played black music at that time. [Upbeat music playing] Fats' primary love for music was in the boogie-woogie piano players. He always listened to Meade Lux Lewis and Pete Johnson, the great piano players. His cousins had a, uh, bar. And he actually not only had a jukebox there, he also had a sounding machine, which was I guess kind of a luxury in those days. The one he particularly remembered, I think it was a video called Low Down Dog. It was actually a comedian who was found his woman foolin' around with different guy in the kitchen, okay, and somethin' like that. And he -
- he chased her. And he -
- he started singin' this song, pointin' his finger at her sayin', I ain't gonna be your low-down dog no more. -[Music] I ain't gonna be your low-down dog no more [Music] [Music] Ain't gonna be your low-down dog no more [Music] -COLEMAN: People that knew it at the time was Joe Turner who was singin'. He was just mimin' the song. And was Pete Johnson who was playin' the boogie-woogie piano. -[Music] Work all day, don't you know, my babe [Music] -Fats loved that video. And he actually started playing Low Down Dog. And he kept playin' it for the next half a century. -[Music] Ooh wee [Music] [Music] Oo-ooh wee [Music] [Music] It's a low down shame... [Music] CLEARY: It's very hard to find out what his formative influences are. Basic blues, old-style blues piano. It's -
- and it's -
- And boogie-woogie, I mean, that, you know, that -
- Straight-up boogie-woogie. -[Music] Bad, bad whiskey [Music] [Music] Bad, bad whiskey [Music] [Music] Bad, bad whiskey made me lose my happy home [Music] -COLEMAN: Another favorite performer of Fats' was Amos Milburn, who was a great boogie-woogie player. Amos played these low-down blues. And they were all really sexy. Fats played blues like Amos Milburn. Another influence of Fats' was Louis Jordan, who was the most popular black singer-performer of the 1940s. And he was famous for all of his novelty songs. But more significantly, he did some songs that I would almost consider rockers, like Caldonia. -[Music] Walkin' with my baby [Music] [Music] She got great, big feet [Music] [Music] She's long, lean and lanky [Music] [Music] And ain't had nothin' to eat [Music] [Music] But she's my baby [Music] [Music] And I love her just the same [Music] [Music] Crazy about that woman [Music] [Music] 'Cause Caldonia is her name [Music] -COLEMAN: He's shouting. And he's -
- and he's playing this heavy boogie-woogie beat. And so that was a song that almost everybody in New Orleans played at one time or another. -[Music] I've always loved you, baby [Music] [Music] 'Cause Caldonia is your name [Music] -COLEMAN: After Fats started playing in the little Ninth Ward clubs, he started running into different people who would be influential in his career. The first one was probably Billy Diamond, who was a local band leader. He was a bass player. He was a little short go-getter. Fats told me during those days, Billy Diamond was the only person who could find a gig. Uh, he could find a gig when nobody else could. -I gave him the name Fats before then, before he even had a record. I gave him the name Fats after a guy named Fat Waller back in them days. He was a great piano player. He got mad when I played piano, called him fat. Don't call me fat. Don't call me fat, brown boy. I don't know what you callin' me fat for. I don't call you Fat Billy. -NARRATOR: While Fats was pounding out boogie-woogie with Billy Diamond's Band at the Hideaway and other neighborhood clubs, a New Orleans trumpet sensation by the name of Dave Bartholomew was on a roll. -COLEMAN: Dave Bartholomew was one of the most popular, if not the most popular, band leader in the city. And occasionally Fats went and see him and check him out. Earl Palmer, who was, uh, Dave's great drummer, had him sit in one time. Fats got up there and played that little jam and boogie-woogie, Swanee River Boogie, or whatever it was, and maybe another song or two. Dave Bartholomew did not like that. As a matter of fact, he came up to Earl Palmer and said afterwards, I thought I told you not to let that guy sit in. Of course, he had no clue that they would have a incredible history to come, as far as making some of the most influential records in the next 10 or 15 years. -NARRATOR: One night, Bartholomew brought a man from Imperial Records, a Mr. Lew Chudd, to see Fats perform at a local club. -DOMINO: I work at the Hideaway. I was real famous at the Hideaway for just playin' other people number. Dave and Lew Chudd came down there one night. Lew Chudd wanted to hear me sing and play. So I did. -COLEMAN: Fats played The Junker's Blues. -[Music] They call, they call me a junker [Music] -COLEMAN: Champion Jack Dupree was the barrelhouse piano player from New Orleans who recorded the original version of The Junker Blues in 1940 and had a, you know, mild success with it. And that was a song that really sold Fats to Lew Chudd. Lew said, You know, I gotta have this guy. And he actually signed him right there on the spot that very night. -DOMINO: And about a week later, say about 2 weeks later, we had got together to record the first record, Fat Man, 1949. -And we never looked back for 25 years. [Upbeat piano] -Dave said, We gonna record 'The Fat Man.' I said, We are? Oh, I got excited. Durin' that period of time, we had a radio program, The Fat Man. So when we got in the studio, Dave said, This is Fats, The Fat Man. I look at Dave, said, Dave, The Fat Man is a white man. -[Music] They call, they call me The Fat Man [Music] [Music] 'Cause I weigh 200 pounds [Music] [Music] All the girls, they love me [Music] [Music] 'Cause I know my way around [Music] [Music] I was standin' [Music] [Music] I was standin' on the corner [Music] [Music] Of Rampart and Canal [Music] [Music] I was watchin', watchin' [Music] [Music] Watchin' all the Creole gals [Music] [Vocalizing] -Fat Man, the first hit that he -
- hit that he had, the first record in 1949, was basically The Junker's Blues. And he told me this the other day. He said, I asked him about The Fat Man.  He said, It's just The Junker's Blues. I just changed it to... From 'they call me a junker,' to -
- to, 'they call me The Fat Man'. -Fats played it as if it was his own. It was very final when Fats played. If you had never heard whoever played the original, if you heard Fats Domino's version, that was enough. You can just take it from there. -So I would say, What we gonna call him? I said, Hell, we gonna call him Fat Man. As soon as they heard it, that was it. [Music] I'm goin', I'm goin', goin' away [Music] [Music] And then I'm goin', goin' to stay [Music] [Music] 'Cause women and a bad life [Music] [Music] They're carryin' this soul away [Music] -NARRATOR: With The Fat Man rising to number one in the February 1950 rhythm and blues charts, Lew Chudd's hunch had paid off. He quickly reassembled Fats with Dave Bartholomew and band for additional sessions at Cosimo Matassa's Rampart Street studio. Cosimo's J&M Music Shop was the only recording studio in town and was quickly becoming the Mecca for record men looking to cash in on the New Orleans rhythm and blues sound. And Dave Bartholomew's little orchestra became the house band backing nearly every performance recorded there. -New Orleans produces a disproportionately large amount of talented musicians. And it really comes up with the raw material. -MAN: It's the only place in the world where everybody, even white listeners, clap on two and four instead of one and three. Right away, you can tell if a white dude's from New Orleans, man, when you hear him clap. He's on the beat. And that's -
- that's kind of, uh, a -
- a natural thing with New Orleans people. You got kids in the street, man... It's a lot of talent, musically, if you stand on a certain way. Well, look at the history of the town. There's always been music. That's maybe why you're born with a lot of it instilled in you. -You can call it the big beat, the sweet beat whatever it is. But New Orleans got the beat. -There have always been gigs in New Orleans. There's only really a few periods in the history of New Orleans in the 20th century where there's been a really thriving recording scene. And, um, the fact that there was is largely due to Dave Bartholomew and Cosimo Matassa. -TOUSSAINT: Cosimo Matassa and Dave Bartholomew put New Orleans on the map. -The room was 15-by-16. I started recording direct to disk, which, uh, had a couple of good features about it. For one thing, you didn't do any editing. You didn't do any pickups. You didn't do any overdubbing. You played the damn thing from beginning to end. And -
- and that made for performance. And I think that helped me. I started on the fact that everybody performed together beginning to end. Had to be right. I always, 'til today, thought that my job was to put on disk what was happening out in the studio. It was OJT, as Dave told me -
- on the job training. -Imperial wanted us to go on a tour after Fats' first record, which was Fat Man Blues. The other side was Detroit City Blues. We had 3 days... It was late startin' this tour 'cause Fats would hide every time we go to look for him 'cause he was afraid to go on the tour. He was, you know, shook up. First time he'd ever went on any tour. And we -
- we got to go on -
- go with us on the trip was Professor Longhair. -I got nothin' but stars with me: Lee Allen, Professor Longhair, Fat Domino, Dave Bartholomew, Bob Foreman, Frank Fields. We're playin' in a dump. At 11:30, 12:00, I said, Wasn't he supposed to pay me at intermission? Earl Palmer say, I seen that man go out the door. I said, Well, he goin' home to get the money. That been 40 years. He ain't come back yet. [Laughs] [Whistling] -NARRATOR: Between 1950 and 1955, Fats recorded a steady stream of singles for Imperial with many of them charting high in the R&B charts. Things were buzzing at Cosimo's studio. And Dave Bartholomew was the go-to guy for all the record labels wishing to record in New Orleans. [Music] Well, I'm goin' to New Orleans [Music] [Music] I'm goin' to see the Mardi Gras [Music] [Music] Well, I'm goin' to New Orleans [Music] [Music] I'm goin' to see the Mardi Gras [Music] [Music] When I get to New Orleans [Music] [Music] I want to know what's carnival for [Music] [Whistling] -NARRATOR: He produced the sessions, wrote the arrangements, and used his band to back the performers. -He was the man number one. He was the boss with the hot sauce. MATASSA: We didn't call him The Chief for nothin'. He was the chief. He kept us focused, and particularly people like Fats he kept focused because Fats tended to doodle and ramble and -
- and -
- and that sort of thing. I think, uh, without a Dave, there might not have been a Fats in the national sense of it. [Cheering and applause] -DOMINO: Thank you. -COLEMAN: Fats showed up in his Cadillac at Cosimo's studio. And Dave was cutting a session with Lloyd Price. And the piano player at the time in Dave's band -
- I think it was Salvador Doucette -
- was not really cutting the triplets too well. And so Fats was the perfect answer to that problem. And he asked Fats if he would sit in. And then he played that amazing introduction to Lawdy Miss Clawdy. And then the triplets and then a -
- a solo in the middle. And it... Lawdy Miss Clawdy became the biggest hit of the year and knocked his own number one, Goin' Home, out of the charts. [Playing] -I think I played on that one. -MAN: Yeah, you did. -MAN: Yeah. -Yeah. You did. -MAN: And here it is, Alan Freed's Rock 'n' Roll Party. And here he is in person: Alan Freed. [Cheers and applause] -Hello, everybody. How are y'all? Welcome to our rock 'n' roll jubilee of stars. And here we go to rockin' with wailin' tenorman, Freddy Mitchell and the rock 'n' roll boogie! Here we go. -COLEMAN: Alan Freed had actually started using the phrase rock 'n' roll at the end of 1954. And the first ever so-called rock 'n' roll concert was his show in New York, January of '55. And it was an all-black show. Alan Freed was using the phrase rock 'n' roll to popularize rhythm and blues primarily with white teenagers. -[Music] Oh well good-bye [Music] [Music] Although I'll cry [Music] [Music] Ain't that a shame [Music] [Music] My tears fell like rain [Music] [Music] Ain't that a shame [Music] [Music] You're the one to blame [Music] -COLEMAN: And so this -
- this crossing point was very significant because Fats Domino came along with his biggest hit ever. And, of course, that was Ain't That a Shame. -[Music] Goodbye [Music] [Music] Ain't that a shame [Music] [Music] My tears fell like rain [Music] [Music] Ain't that a shame [Music] [Music] You're the one to blame [Music] [Music] You broke my heart [Music] [Music] When you said we'll part [Music] -That's nothing. That was one sentence. Ain't That a Shame, it don't have no bridge to it, no middle. It's the same, uh, sentence over and over again. But we sold it with -
- with the music. Duh-duh, duh-dum, boom. In other words, I had the whole band playin' like a bass. Boom, boom. -[Music] Me cry [Music] [Music] When you said goodbye [Music] [Music] Ain't that a shame [Music] -COLEMAN: It was also one of his simplest songs ever. If you listen to Ain't That a Shame, you'll see, You made me cry when you said goodbye. And that's actually a classic Fats Domino lyric because he -
- he just wrote things in the most simple terms possible. -DOMINO: I remember them tellin' me, Your record goin' pop. I didn't know what he was talkin' about. Lew Chudd, see, The record goin' pop. You got a big record. Well, I'm like... We had sellers before. Goin' Home, The Fat Man, you know -
- that's what broke me through everybody buyin' my record, black and the white. He say, You got a big one now. [Music] Tears fell like rain [Music] [Music] Ain't that a shame [Music] -NARRATOR: The surprise success of Ain't That a Shame was a game-changer for both Fats and Imperial Records. Though finally achieving a crossover hit that was selling phenomenally to both black and white audiences, Dave and Fats could not have predicted what would happen within a week of its release. [Music] You make me cry [Music] [Music] When you said goodbye [Music] [Music] Ain't that a shame [Music] [Music] My tears fell like rain [Music] -DOMINO: Mine was not a week. Somebody told me, you know, a fellow by the name of Pat Boone comin' out with your record next week. Hollerin' somethin' crazy. -And Pat Boone was a very, um, innocent, white crooner, should we say. And, uh, he just was kind of, uh, you know, tryin' to croon a song that should have been a rocker. -Keep in mind, it was him, you know. A lot of people wasn't gonna buy us at all because we were black, at that time. You know, there was segregation in music too. I know that, you know, I don't wanna hear it. But after they heard it a while, it started growin' on you, and that's it, like anything else. -DOMINO: He did it all right. It sold a lot of records. -NARRATOR: While Ain't That a Shame was burning up the 1955 R&B and pop charts, other black artists such as Chuck Berry and Little Richard were following Fats' lead. -[Music] Woo, hoo, hoo, hoo baby [Music] [Music] Havin' me some fun tonight [Music] -NARRATOR: The rock 'n' roll era had begun. -MAN: Rolling master A. Master A, take one. [Applause] -NARRATOR: By early 1956, Elvis Presley was the king of the pop charts. -[Music] You know I can be found [Music] [Music] Sitting home all alone [Music] -NARRATOR: Rockers Bill Haley and the Comets, Gene Vincent, and Carl Perkins were also grabbing the attention of the nation's youth. By March of 1956, Fats' I'm in Love Again became his second top-10 hit. Dave Bartholomew's big beat was making Antoine Domino a very famous man. -[Music] Yes, it's me, and I'm in love again [Music] [Music] Had no lovin' since you know when [Music] [Music] You know I love you, yes I do [Music] [Music] And I'm savin' all my lovin' just for you [Music] [Music] I need your lovin', and I need it bad [Music] [Music] Just like a dog when he's goin' mad [Music] [Music] Whoa-wee, baby, whoa-wee [Music] [Music] Baby, won't you give your love to me [Music] [Music] Eeny-meeny and miney-mo [Music] [Music] Told me you didn't want me around no more [Music] [Music] Whoa-wee, baby, whoa-wee [Music] [Music] Baby, don't you let your dog bite me [Music] [Instrumental] [Music] Yes, it's me, and I'm in love again [Music] [Music] Had no lovin' since you know when [Music] [Music] You know I love you, yes I do [Music] [Music] And I'm savin' all my lovin' just for you [Music] [Music] Eeny-meeny and miney-mo [Music] [Music] Told me you didn't want me around no more [Music] [Music] Whoa-wee, baby, whoa-wee [Music] [Music] Baby, don't you let your dog bite me [Music] [Instrumental ending] -NARRATOR: The year 1956 belonged to Fats Domino. With nine records scoring in the top-10 pop and rhythm and blues charts, there was no stopping him. And in that year, he recorded the song for which he will be forever remembered. -[Music] I found my thrill [Music] [Music] On Blueberry Hill [Music] -COLEMAN: Blueberry Hill was a pop standard that had originally been recorded in 1940 by Gene Autry for a singin' cowboy movie. But the most significant version for Fats was the Louis Armstrong version. It was a phenomenal time for him. The unfortunate thing is that Lew Chudd of Imperial Records actually tried too hard to sell Fats Domino to a white audience. He thought that if you made it sound more pop, it would sell more white. But he kind of missed the point of Fats Domino. And so he was having him record all these standards. Some worked, some didn't. As Blueberry Hill proved, when Fats redid a standard, he changed it all around so the people that knew the old standard, they barely recognized it. -And the rest is history. A record that has, I've been told, sold over 5 1/2 million records, Blueberry Hill. And of course, his number one record of all time. [Music] I found my thrill [Music] [Music] On Blueberry Hill [Music] [Music] On Blueberry Hill [Music] [Music] When I found you [Music] [Music] The moon stood still [Music] [Music] On Blueberry Hill [Music] [Music] And lingered until [Music] [Music] My dream came... [Music] [Music] The wind in the willow played [Music] [Music] Love's sweet melody [Music] [Music] But all of the vows we made [Music] [Music] Were never to be [Music] [Music] Though we're apart [Music] [Music] You're part of me still [Music] [Music] For you were my thrill [Music] [Music] On Blueberry Hill [Music] [Music] The wind in the willow played [Music] [Music] Love's sweet melody [Music] [Music] But all of the vows we made [Music] [Music] Were never to be [Music] [Music] Though we're apart [Music] [Music] You're part of me still [Music] [Music] For you were my thrill [Music] [Music] On Blueberry Hill [Music] -COLEMAN: He had an amazing string of success at that time. But with Blueberry Hill, Blue Monday and I'm Walkin', Fats had three huge hits at the time. Even<i> Time</i> magazine recognized it. He was huge. He -
- he was actually headlining the biggest shows in rock 'n' roll at that time. People like Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Buddy Holly, the Everly Brothers and Jerry Lee Lewis were all underneath Fats. They did not even approach his record sales at that time. He was selling a million records every month. -RAY: There was a time he and Elvis Presley, for a year or two there, were neck and neck in sales. People don't realize this. -[Music] I'm beat to my socks [Music] [Music] My gal calls, got to tell her that I'm out [Music] [Music] 'Cause Thursday is a hard workin' day [Music] [Music] And Friday I get my pay [Music] -HARDESTY: We did it in California. And -
- and recordin' Blue Monday, they had another saxophone player playin' the baritone. He... Fats didn't like the way he soloed on it. He said, Herbert, I want you to play the baritone. You want me to play the baritone? I got my tenor here. He said, No, please, play the solo on baritone. So I played the solo on baritone. And he went wild. And the, uh, people love it, like the da, da, da-da. Let me see if I can play it on my saxophone. I don't have my strap. [Playing] -Blue Monday, I think that's one of the greatest things I ever wrote. -[Music] Saturday mornin', oh Saturday mornin' [Music] [Music] All my tiredness has gone away [Music] [Music] Got my money and my honey [Music] [Music] And I'm out on the stand to play [Music] [Music] Sunday mornin' my head is bad [Music] [Music] But it's worth it for the times that I've had [Music] [Music] But I've got to get my rest [Music] [Music] 'Cause Monday's a mess [Music] [Music] The big beat keep you rockin' in your seat [Music] -NARRATOR: By the end of 1956, all of the major television networks and Hollywood began to call. And the entire nation was tuning in. -[Music] The sun's gonna shine [Music] [Music] In my back door some day [Music] [Music] Just you wait and see [Music] [Music] Just you wait and see [Music] [Music] Girl can't help it [Music] [Music] She was born to please [Music] [Music] Can't help it, the girl can't help it [Music] [Music] And she's got a figure made to squeeze [Music] [Music] Can't help it, the girl can't help it [Music] [Music] And she's got a figure made to squeeze [Music] [Music] Can't help it, the girl can't help it [Music] -Let's face it, rhythm and blues, uh, is here. So we have a man here today who is just about the hottest attraction in that field. As a matter of fact, I have a -
- have a little award to present to him a bit later, something I don't know if he knows about yet. The one and only Fats Domino. -[Music] When my dreamboat comes home [Music] -BARTHOLOMEW: You wanna make a good impression because this means an awful lot to you to be on those type of shows. You're not only help -
- helpin' them, you're helpin' yourself, gettin' yourself exposure all over the world. So you think about that. And you wanna do the best you can. -When Fats appeared on network TV show, it increased sales tremendously. -Uh, Fats, as you know, is one of our great disciples of rock 'n' roll. And Fats, according to a clipping in Down Beat, Dizzy Gillespie just finished a tour in the Middle East where he was a smash. -DOMINO: Crazy, man. -And Louis Armstrong was a big hit in South Africa. -DOMINO: Crazy, man. -And a rumor has it that you're going to introduce rock 'n' roll to Alaska. -DOMINO: Cool, man. [Music] I'm walkin', yes indeed [Music] [Music] And I'm talkin' about you and me [Music] [Music] And I'm hopin' you'll ask me back again [Music] -[Music] I'm flyin', I'm flyin' high [Music] [Music] I'm shy, me, oh, my [Music] [Music] I'm hopin' you'll ask me back again, again [Music] -[Music] What you gonna do when the well runs dry [Music] [Music] You gonna run away tonight [Music] [Music] I'm gonna run right by your side [Music] [Music] For you, Perry Como, I'd even die [Music] -COLEMAN: This is November 18, 1956, a very significant date, a very cold night in New York City when Ed Sullivan announced Fats Domino. -ANNOUNCER: The Ed Sullivan Show. -I had a lot of respect for him. He spent a lot of time with us. He -
- he -
- he gave us his all. And you know what I mean. He would be with us all day long. And -
- and that wasn't all. And then he had us as many times that we wanted to. -...New Orleans, another... Well, he's had so many. This... He's had 1 million record, million sales record. Here is Fats Domino singing Blueberry Hill. So, let's hear it... [Playing] -COLEMAN: He put Fats' band behind a curtain. And he put Fats just playing the piano by himself, which was a very strange thing for Fats. And then even stranger was at the very end of the show -
- of the song, I should say, Fats stood up. It was kind of like Ed Sullivan wanted people to see how chubby he was so that, you know, he looks harmless. -[Music] For you were my thrill [Music] -One of the great record stars, high on the list of all hits in the country today, is a very happy, little, rotund fellow named Fats Domino. -That was the beginning of the harmless Fats Domino mythology, which still continues to some degree today. -Well, Fats, I have this surprise for you now. This is from Cash Box, one of the important, uh, record industry, uh, trade papers. And they want you to have this award because you've been voted by the Disc Jockeys of America the most programmed rhythm and blues male vocalist of the year 1956. Congratulations. -Thank you. Thank you. -NARRATOR: In 1957, the Fats Domino band traveled 30,000 miles around the country, working a total of 355 shows and selling out nightclubs and concert halls everywhere they ventured. -ALLEN: He was one of the biggest stars out. There was no other bigger star than Fats in -
- in the rock 'n' roll field. -MAN: We -
- we got to knock and push 'em off of us. You know, I mean, you know, they -
- they was just somethin' else. They knock down the walls to get to Fats Domino. I'm not kiddin'. They really did. -RAY: I did a lot of travelin'. Nothin' like bein' with Fats Domino. We'd drive and drive. And I keep sayin', Well, aren't we gonna stop for lunch? Aren't we gonna -
- are we gonna eat? -McLEAN: You know, him and his brother came in the house and said, No, we want you to come and go to Pensacola, Florida with us. We got to be there tonight. I say, It's Christmas. I don't wanna go nowhere. And you know what happened? They took and carried me and picked me up, I'm helpless, and put me on the bus. And, you know, I was in Florida. -BARTHOLOMEW: That was my life out there. A lot of times we was doin' them one nighters, all night long sleepin' in the car and all that kinda (bleep). -HARDESTY: The most fun was after we got off in the hotels. There was party, party, party, parties goin' on from the bottom to the top floor. -NARRATOR: With Fats' enormous popularity, promoters had little trouble filling concert halls and ballrooms to capacity. White and black fans clamored to see Fats live, sometimes with explosive results. -COLEMAN: He had more riots than any other rock 'n' roller, uh, maybe ever. He had four major riots at his shows, partly because of integration but also the fact that they had alcohol at these shows. So they were mixing alcohol plus dancing plus the races together for the first time in a lot of these places. And it was leading to a little fights which soon bloomed into huge fights. And they called the police. -HARDESTY: We got caught in two riots. And it wasn't -
- it wasn't a racial thing. There was a fight. And with -
- within the fight, the police decided to throw tear gas in the hall. And everybody panic. Well, it turned out not to be a riot, but people tryin' to escape -
- tryin' to get away from the tear gas. When they started broadcastin' that there was -
- where Fats Domino was playin' and there was a race riot, that was a $1 million exposure right there. All the news media picked it up. So that was publicity. But there... It wasn't a real race riot. -COMO: Fats, this rock 'n' roll music seems to be under an awful heavy attack from all over the country. There's been riots. It's been banned in certain parts of this country and abroad. You know of any reason for that? -Well, as far as I know, music make people happy. I know it make me happy. -COMO: You wouldn't blame it on rock 'n' roll. -No, indeed. -What happened up in Rhode Island where you where playin'? -Well, you know how it is when the Navy and Marines get together. -You don't think it was the music? -No, couldn't be. -NARRATOR: Life on the road for an African-American rock 'n' roll band, even the country's most popular one, was mired in the pre-Civil Rights mores of the day. -DOMINO: Sometimes we used to go up 100 mile out the way to get a place to sleep. -It was tough. We stayed in little, small-like hotels. We didn't have the privilege and the -
- the restaurants. I started drivin' the bus. And I would go into these restaurants or these places and sort of help integration along to push things, you know? And when the hotels first integrated, that was -
- I was the first ones in them. -Well, I think there is, uh, no doubt about the fact that, uh, the Negro is more determined now than ever before to be free. I think that there is a discontent in the Negro community, a frustration and an impatience, if we can use that word, uh, that we haven't seen before. I've been around the country for the last few days, uh, speaking. And I don't think I've ever seen, uh, the Negro population of our nation more aroused and more determined as I've seen on these particular trips. -DIAMOND: Before Martin Luther King got killed, Fats was in that same hotel 2 weeks before then playin' for the -
- the garbage workers there. He'd bring the -
- the workers together when -
- whenever he'd play, white and black. It's somethin' about his person that draw a lot of people in, you know. -MAN: Once it was recognized, once it accepted, and once the -
- the audience, the people started wantin' this music, there was nothin' that the radio stations or television can do about it. They had to accept it. -COLEMAN: So there was this historic moment in American history that -
- that things were kind of coming together. And people don't really credit rock 'n' roll with integrating America. But it really did. -NARRATOR: Constantly far away from his loving family and his Ninth Ward home, life on the road was beginning to take its toll. -DOMINO: Anybody, when you first leave home, especially New Orleans, you still got your home on your mind. And the whole band is like that. Every time I had a Monday night off, I usually fly home. -NARRATOR: Although he received the adulation of millions of fans, Fats always longed to be on that last stretch of highway that led to the city he loved. -[Music] This time I'm walkin' to New Orleans [Music] [Music] I'm walkin' to New Orleans [Music] [Music] I'm gonna need two pair of shoes [Music] [Music] When I get through walkin' these blues [Music] [Music] When I get back to New Orleans [Music] [Music] I've got my suitcase in my hand [Music] [Music] Now ain't that a shame [Music] [Music] I'm leavin' here today [Music] [Music] Yes, I'm goin' back home to stay [Music] [Music] Yes, I'm walkin' to New Orleans [Music] [Music] You used to be my honey [Music] [Music] 'Til I lost all my money [Music] [Music] No use for me to cry [Music] [Music] I'll see you by and by [Music] [Music] 'Cause I'm walkin' to New Orleans [Music] [Music] And I got no time for talkin' [Music] [Music] I'm walkin' to New Orleans [Music] -NARRATOR: By the end of 1963, a new generation of rockers, many of whom idolized Fats, were grabbing the world's attention. Although Fats continued to record, his top-10 hit records were now well behind him. For the next 40 years, he brought the big beat around the world, performing his hits at sold-out shows from New Orleans to Japan. -[Music] I'm walkin' [Music] [Music] Yes, indeed I'm walkin' [Music] -NARRATOR: Up until his final public performance in 2006, Dave Bartholomew and Herb Hardesty were often in the band. For 65 years, Fats never departed from his boogie-woogie roots and always ended his shows with a gumbo-spiced ode to New Orleans -
- When the Saints Go Marchin' In. -[Music] Oh, when the saints [Music] [Music] Go marchin' in [Music] [Music] Oh, when the saints go marchin' in [Music] -BARTHOLOMEW: Always close with the saints. Sometimes we couldn't get off the bandstand, we'd go back. -[Music] When the saints go marchin' in [Music] [Music] Oh, when the sun [Music] [Music] Refused to shine [Music] [Music] Oh, when the sun refused to shine [Music] -A gentlemen. When you work with a man 50 years, that should speak for itself. [Music] Oh, when the saints [Music] [Music] Go marchin' in [Music] [Music] Oh, when the saints go marchin' in [Music] -The stories he told was so charmin', even when he was tellin' a hard luck story. A prince of a man. -[Music] Oh, when the sun [Music] [Music] Refused to shine [Music] [Music] Oh, when the sun refused to shine [Music] [Music] I say I want to be in that number [Music] -Colleges and universities that had courses only on jazz artists. I can... Why not on -
- on -
- on artists like Fats or Chuck Berry? I can never understand why the cities that they represented didn't recognize them the same way they would recognize a Louis Armstrong. -COLEMAN: John Lennon, the first song he ever learned was Ain't That a Shame. First rock 'n' roll song that George Harrison ever heard was I'm in Love Again. And Paul McCartney's just recorded a slew of Fats Domino songs. Uh, on top of that, Elvis Presley once even called Fats the king of rock 'n' roll. Little Richard said that he worshipped Fats and was honored to touch his hand. And, of course, he recorded most of his hits with members of Fats' band. -Here you have a formula that they haven't had to change in over half a century. It's as good now as it was then. The music business changes every week. Here is something that you're witnessing and listening to the same sound that music lovers would have been hearing half a century ago. And it still does the trick. It does the trick because it's really good. -Two Daves, I don't think that would have worked. Uh, two Fats wouldn't have gotten off the ground. Two Fats would have had to find another one Dave somewhere. -I'm glad I could join the elites and just be one in a crowd. Together we stand, divided we fall.

Jamie, how you doing? Mr. Jonas, how are you? Good to see you. Yeah. Nice to see you as always. It's a pleasure. What's good? Narrator: Owner and head butcher Jamie Stachowski brings some serious flair to his Georgetown storefront. Stachowski: We're a throwback. This just reminds people of some time back in their history-
- a custom butcher shop, where you can find a variety of meat products and things to go along with them. [Sizzling] That's what we've tried to achieve here, is a corner candy store for carnivores. And let's do some scallopini. Just slice it, maybe pound it a little for me. All right, terrific. All right, so let me get this sliced up and pounded. Jonas: There just aren't places like this anymore, where you have a local butcher, a local meat store. This is like Paris. This is like the Italian countryside. There's a little bit of it right here in Georgetown. There's a nice feeling to the place. Narrator: Stop by at lunch for one of the market's signature sandwiches, like the hot pastrami or 4-meat grinder. Just don't plan on finishing it anytime soon. Man: Oh, no. You really can't eat the grinder in one sitting. And if you can, make him president of the United States. I was surprised when I received it, because I literally could eat this all week long. So we had to have it cut in 4s just for me to be able to take a bite. Stachowski: You travel to the Polish neighborhood where I'm from, sandwiches were meals to us, so they tended to be on the big side. Look, we are in Georgetown, but we're tucked up away in the Rose Park neighborhood. So we gotta stand out, and our sandwiches let us do that. Now we've gotten the reputation for that. Narrator: And if your appetite isn't so big, there are still a few items on the menu that might be just the ticket. Sometimes if you don't feel like you can handle 3 days' worth of sandwich, might just need a salad! Narrator: To learn more about Neighborhood Eats, visit WETA.org.

- You try to pull the technical defense. I was at my apartment, I don't live there. 
- No. 
- You could easily have said, I co-hosted the party, and I told the police that and that's why I'm here. So, baby, you had to bring your mother to court today, huh? 
- I did. 
- Are you still spoon-feeding him or not? Did you know that you could not park there with a placard? 
- I only parked there 30 seconds. 
- You were there 30 seconds? 
- 30-45 seconds, ah... 
- You keep talking, they're gonna take your handicap placard away. 
- This is the courtroom of Judge Frank Caprio, where people and cases are met with compassion. A different kind of judge. A courtroom like no other. This is Caught in Providence. 
- Nicholas Damon. 
- Good morning, Your Honor. 
- Okay, Mr. Damon, you're charged with going through a red light on Roger Williams Avenue and Elmwood Avenue at 10:18 in the morning. Is this your lawyer with you? 
- This is my mother. 
- I'm his mom. 
- When are you gonna stop taking care of these kids? 
- I don't know. 
- How long does it take before you cut the cord? 
- Never. 
- Never. 
- Never. 
- That's a good answer. 
- Now... this is a classic case, Inspector Quinn, of a mother coming to court for her little boy. 
- Yup, it's her baby. She's here for her baby. 
- She's here for her baby. I have to go to court for my baby. Do you have any younger than him? 
- No, no. 
- No, only child. 
- So he's your baby. 
- He's my baby, yeah, he's my only one. 
- So, baby, you had to bring your mother to court today, huh? 
- I did, I did. Hopefully it helps. 
- Are you still spoon-feeding him or not? 
- No. 
- No? Well, he's... he's charged with going through a red light. We're gonna look at it. 
- Good. 
- What is your name? 
- Kerri. 
- Kerri. 
- Damon. 
- Damon. Well, come up here. Come up here, come up here. 
- You know, it's not gonna end well for you, so get rid of that smile. 
- Get over here. 
- Okay. 
- We're gonna-
- you've gotta give me a hand on deciding this case, okay? 
- Okay, all right. 
- You've gotta be honest. 
- I will be honest, yeah. 
- All right. 
- No special leniency. 
- No special leniency. 
- All right, so, okay, so-
- 
- He hasn't had any... 
- All right, so I'm gonna get over here, you're gonna get over here, and we're gonna look at the video right here. Okay, Lisa, let's go. The light is red. And... 
- Uh... I thought it was a right on red. 
- Hold on for a minute. The light is red. He's coming down. And he made a right-hand turn. Okay, now, what do you wanna tell me about that? 
- Well, he did have his brakes on. And it was a slow, it was a slow... 
- You... you can take a right turn on red over there. It does have a sign that says-
- 
- I'm talking to your mother. 
- All right, all right, sorry. 
- Be careful. 
- I guess it was a rolling stop. 
- It was a rolling stop. You don't think he stopped. 
- Um... No, he didn't stop completely, no. 
- You agree with that, Inspector Quinn? 
- She took the words right out of my mouth, Judge. 
- Yeah? So what do you think we should do with him? 
- Um... I don't know, I've done a lot to him already and screamed at him about it, and I-
- I don't-
- 
- Did you beat him up? 
- I didn't beat him up. No, I couldn't... 
- Wanna use this? 
- I could use this. 
- All right. Like every mother, like every mother, right, she sees the good in her son, right? You're still her little baby. You can make a right-hand turn on red. At this location you had to stop. Your mother says your brakes were on and that you came to a rolling stop, so the question is-
- she's making an impassioned plea that you made an attempt to stop and that it was a close call. Is that what you were saying? 
- That's what I was saying, yes. 
- So how do you wanna find him? Guilty or not guilty? 
- Uh, I would find him not guilty. 
- Surprise. It's a big surprise, Inspector Quinn. 
- I'm totally shocked on that ruling, Judge. 
- All right, I asked for it, so I guess you're gonna be found not guilty. Good luck to you. 
- Thank you so much. 
- All right, take care. 
- Daniel Ferreras. Good morning, sir. 
- Good morning. 
- You have a parking ticket on Salisbury Street. 
- Yeah. 
- This is parking in a prohibited area. Now, listen, hold on a second. All right, good. We have two mics. You are between both of them. Get to one or the other. Get close, get closer to the mic. 
- Like that? 
- Perfect. Okay, what do you wanna tell me? You have a handicap placard. 
- I missing the ticket. I... I'm no more here for that. But I go over to the... to have a handicap ticket. Says $90. It's too much for me. 
- Mr. Ferreras, a handicap... placard allows you to park in the handicap zone. 
- Mm-hmm. 
- It also allows you to park at a parking meter without putting money in the meter. 
- No have a meter, nothing like that. 
- I know. It also allows you to park in a timed zone. It does not allow you to park in a sign that says no parking. Did you know that you could not park there with the placard? 
- I only park there 30 seconds, sir. 
- You were there 30 seconds? 
- Yeah. 
- All right, wait, hold on for a minute. 
- 30 seconds is up. 
- Yes. 
- You parked that far. You get out of the car, what did you do? 
- I pick up my daughter for the house and outside, that's it. 
- You went to your daughter's house, all right... and then you came back out. 
- Yeah. 
- And that took 30 seconds. 
- From my car-
- my car is 30-
- 
- You took 30 seconds. Right, you got out, you ran and got right back in. Inspector Quinn, this guy's the fastest guy in the country. 
- I was gonna say, it takes me about 30 seconds to shut the car off, open the car door, shake it off a little bit and get out. 
- Inspector Quinn, he's got a handicap placard. You wanna give him some leniency? 
- Yes, Your Honor. We wouldn't, uh... We'll move to dismiss with the warning, advising him about the legal spot. I just wanna check the date on that handicap. 
- Mr. Ferreras, listen to me. 
- Yes. 
- All right, just so you know... ... you said it took me 30 seconds to go in the house... see my daughter and come back out. You're handicapped. 
- No, no, no, no, no, to see my daughter-
- 
- You've got a cane. 
- I put daughter back on fifth floor and go back. 
- Yeah, I know, you went in, you came back out in 30 seconds. 
- 30-45 seconds, ah... something. 
- You keep talking, they're gonna take your handicap placard away. They're gonna say you're pretty healthy. You better be careful. All right. Based on the recommendation of Inspector Quinn, the matter is dismissed. According to your admission, it was your party. 
- I mean, I guess. 
- You just told me, you co-hosted it. 
- Yeah, but it wasn't just mine. 
- Have you ever been in a court? 
- No, first time in my life, and I am excited about it. Thank you very much! Ordinary tissues left Dakota's nose sore and red. So Dad slayed the problem with Puffs Plus Lotion, instead. With lotion to soothe and softness to please. A nose in need deserves Puffs, indeed. 
- Muammer Tukar. Good morning, sir, you are charged with... 
- Good morning. 
- ... parking overnight. 
- Uh, yeah. First of all, I am sorry for my English. Uh... I am learn-
- I am-
- I am trying to learn English. If I say something wrong, I am sorry for this. 
- You can't say anything wrong here. 
- Okay. 
- Where are you from? 
- Turkey. 
- How long have you been here? 
- Uh, ten months here. 
- You're doing pretty good. 
- Thank you very much. 
- Yeah, what do you do? Are you a student? 
- I am-
- I am... studying in-
- I am student in Brown University, and I am working in labs. And today... first time, I park my car in 3:00 and after one and half hour... when I... when I come to near my car, I found a violation parking ticket and there is no sign about the no parking here because this is not own. I just-
- I want to just study in lab two hours but... and there is no sign about no parking or no overnight parking. 
- Okay. Have you ever been in a court in Turkey? 
- No, first time here. 
- First time in court? 
- First time in my life, and I am excited about it. 
- Well, we hope we give you a favorable impression of the United States judicial system. All right, so... let me explain to you what the situation is, okay? Everything you said is accurate. Everything you said. There are no signs that say you cannot park overnight, all right? And, plus, to complicate matters more, there's a sign saying you can park during certain hours, and you were not parked during those certain hours, so, in your mind, I can park here. Which makes sense to me. Except that the city has a... a set of ordinances. These are the city laws. And in here it says you cannot park overnight in Providence. So, before you came from Turkey, you were supposed to read this book. 
- Read all of that? I have just two-
- two months here. 
- So... it's a very confusing thing. People in Providence know they can't, but I don't think it's fair for us to charge you for parking overnight, when, number one, you didn't know, number two, the sign was very misleading. So that's the short version of saying that you won your case. So when you get back to Turkey, you can say, I was in the United States, and I received a summons to go to court, and I fought the system and I won. 
- Am I won now? 
- You win. 
- Oh, thank you very much. Thank you. 
- Good luck to you, the matter is dismissed. You did a-
- you did a wonderful job. 
- Thank you very much. Thank you again. 
- As many of you know, videos of our cases have been watched nearly two billion times on social media platforms such as YouTube and Facebook. Over half of these views come from foreign countries. Almost universally the viewers comment that they wished the court proceedings in their countries were as fair as the ones in our courtroom. While not always perfect, the United States judicial system is based on the premise that everyone is innocent until proven guilty. That's not the case everywhere. I'm pleased that we were able to demonstrate that concept in person to Mr. Tukar in the hope that he enjoys the rest of his stay in our great country. Juliana Roland. 
- Good morning, Your Honor. 
- Good morning, Juliana. Juliana, you have a speeding ticket on Chalkstone Avenue, in a school zone. 
- Yes. 
- Is there anything you wanna tell me about? 
- Yes, Your Honor. I'm here from South Carolina. I reside in South Carolina. 
- In Lexington. 
- And-
- I'm sorry. 
- In Lexington, South Carolina. 
- No, actually, I'm in Blythewood. 
- Oh-
- 
- It was a rental vehicle. 
- Oh. 
- I have been out of the state of Rhode Island since 1994, and I was back visiting my dad-
- 88 years old. He was entering hospice that weekend. And so... I'm familiar with the area. I lived on Pembroke Avenue just, you know, north of Nathanael Greene Middle School. I'm familiar with the area. I was staying at a rental property in Providence and just picked up speed going down that hill. Didn't see the sign for the school zone. I know Nathanael Greene School is there. I've had one speed ticket in my driving life, 1991, on the New York State Thruway. I had that dismissed because I was a safe driver. I just taught my 16-year-old to drive. She was licensed last week. So, I'm asking forgiveness, if not leniency for this because I am a safe driver, and... I'm certainly guilty of the charge, but, um... 
- Well, you're one mile over what I would charge ordinarily. I have... I have an issue, not a problem. I have an issue with that-
- the location of that particular mechanism, because Chalkstone Avenue is a hill going down... 
- Yes, it is, yes, it is. 
- ... into Raymond Street, and that's where they've got the machine. So you actually would have to be pumping the brakes going down the hill to be going... to keep within the speed limit, and you were one over what I usually charge, so I'm gonna give you a break. 
- Thank you, thank you, Your Honor. 
- Is it your dad that's going into hospice? 
- He passed on June 12th, so... last time I saw him but it was good to be here. But nice gift. But thank you for dismissing, Your Honor. I appreciate it. 
- In memory of your dad. 
- Thank you, thank you-
- thanks, Dad. 
- Good luck. You actually had a pretty good morning. You know that. 
- Both tickets were not me, and I have to pay somebody else's mistake. Yeah, it's a pretty great morning. 
- I think you better leave before I change my mind. Around here, nobody ever does it. I Didn't do it. So when I heard they added Ultra Oxi to the cleaning power of Tide, it was just what we needed.

- Aga Delgado. This is a environmental summons. MC59159. Charges you with a noise violation where there was loud music coming from your house at 2:30 in the morning. 
- Yeah. 
- Where you having a party? 
- Yeah, but this actually-
- 
- What kind of a party was it? 
- This wasn't actually my house, so they kind of gave it to me by accident. They thought I lived there because it was my friend's house, and I was there at the party with everybody else, but they assumed I lived there, so they gave me the fine. The officer had told me that I could possibly fight it or get it dismissed since I am not a resident at the house. 
- So you were a guest. 
- Yeah. 
- According to the police report, the police spoke to you and you said that you were hosting the welcome-back party. Is that right? 
- No. Actually, I was co-hosting with him, so, yes, I was helping and I was, like, a part of it, but-
- 
- So you were the organizer? 
- No-
- well, it was-
- 
- You were hosting it, you were the organizer. 
- Yeah. But, I mean, I guess I really was the one who took a fall for it. 
- Yeah. So, according to your admission, it was your party. 
- I mean... I guess. 
- You just told me, you co-hosted it. 
- Yeah, but it wasn't just mine. 
- Was, uh... Martin-
- was Martin Severs also-
- 
- Yeah, he also got fined... 
- He got one too. 
- ... but his was dismissed. 
- Well, I'm not sure. I didn't dismiss it. 
- Yeah, I know, I'm just saying. 
- Inspector Quinn, you wanna be heard on this? 
- Your Honor, based on the, uh... the statements in the report, um... 
- Well, she was a little disingenuous when she first-
- when she first came out. If you had just been honest when you first came out and said-
- you know, you try to pull the technical defense. Well, I was at my apartment, I don't live there. 
- No. 
- You could have easily said, I co-hosted the party, and I told the police that and that's why I'm here. 
- I mean, I was just-
- 
- I know what you were trying to do. 
- Trying to say what they had told me, 'cause they said that. 
- I get it. Inspector Quinn? 
- Your Honor, based on the report, it would be $100 or she can have a trial. 
- You would've got a much better disposition if you had been honest from the beginning. Inspector Quinn made a recommendation. $100 fine or come back and have a trial. 
- I mean, I... 
- The matter's set down for trial. Good luck. If you wanna be trusted, you must be honest. If Ms. Delgado had simply told me the truth about her role in the party, I would have been inclined to dismiss the charges. Thomas Jefferson once said, Honesty is the first chapter in the book of wisdom. It's also the best policy for every situation in life. Including how you behave in the courtroom. Tony Acevedo. Tony, you have three registrations. 
- Hmm? 
- Do you understand what I just said? 
- Three registrations? 
- Yes. Now, who's Maria-
- 
- That's my mother, sir. 
- Valenzuela. Are you here for her? 
- Yes, sir. 
- All right, she has an overnight parking ticket on Althea... 
- Yes, sir. 
- There's a $40 penalty. I waived the penalty. 
- Thank you. 
- So you just saved $40. You got the first ticket dismissed. Now comes the bad news. You have two red-light violations. One goes back to last year and one is... just two weeks ago. This is a ticket on North Main and Branch at 7:38 in the evening. What's the time on that? 
- .4, Your Honor. 
- All right. The next one is... on Pleasant Valley and Valley Street. Is that him making a right-hand turn? 
- Yes, Your Honor. That's no turn on red at all. 
- Was this during the period of construction? 
- Yes, Your Honor. 
- I'm gonna find-
- I'm gonna dismiss that ticket where the signs were confusing, and it will be $85 on the other. This is gonna cost you a total of $105. You actually had a pretty good morning. You know that. 
- Yeah. Yeah, compared to that both-
- both tickets were not me, and I have to pay somebody else's mistake. Yeah, it's a pretty great morning. 
- I think you better leave before I change my mind. 
- I would. I'M ALEX TREBEK HERE TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE COLONIAL PENN PROGRAM. IF YOU'RE AGE 50-85 AND LOOKING TO BUY LIFE INSURANCE ON A FIXED BUDGET, REMEMBER THE THREE P'S. THE THREE WHAT?

- Daniel Capella. 
- Good morning, Judge. 
- Good morning, sir. All right, you have a parking meter violation. 
- Yeah, it's from my wife. Maria. 
- You're throwing your wife under the bus already. 
- She goes to Providence Power Yoga there and-
- 
- She goes to yoga? 
- Yeah. And she had to work today, so... 
- Oh, she's meditating. 
- Does yoga, does all those... 
- Yeah, but I mean she must be meditating now. She sent you-
- she sent you to court. 
- I'm gonna have to meditate for her. 
- All right, what do you wanna tell me on the merits of the case? 
- There's a parking lot there. She said she always parks in the parking lot, so she doesn't understand. 
- This one day she didn't park in the parking lot she got the ticket. 
- Yeah. 
- Now, the ticket was 25, you didn't pay it... so it went to 75. But we're gonna waive the penalties. 
- Thank you. 
- So you tell your wife that you took a really beating today in front of the judge. The judge beat you down. 
- I'm hobbling home. 
- I don't want you going home, telling your wife you paid $75 and try and get reimbursed now. 
- I wish. 
- All right, $25.

- Bertrand Brousseau. 
- Morning, Your Honor. 
- Morning, sir. Mr. Brousseau, you have a, uh, expired meter ticket on Angel Street. 
- I paid that three times. 
- (laughing) 
- Three times, and number-
- Let me just give you a little quick rundown. 
- All right. 
- My daughter works on top of the bookstore on Thayer Street. 
- Yeah, okay. 
- All right, third floor. Her office is up there. It was the day before her birthday. I went to drop something off to her. I-
- She was busy. I know that. So I just dropped it off. Took me 30 seconds. 30 seconds to get down the stairs, up the stairs. But anyways, um-
- 
- You sure it wasn't 15 seconds? 
- I-
- It was closer than that. I'm handicapped. But, uh, anyways, the, uh... the meter had expired. And I had put eight quarters in the stupid thing and it still didn't go anywhere. I put a sign on it... broken meter. The lady tagged me anyways. I went and found her. I was probably in that office 15 minutes. I said, you know, what is-
- so, anyways. But they were chasing me and I kept paying 25, 25, 25. It never got caught up. I gave 'em 50 already. 
- (chuckling) 
- I think-
- No, I think I gave 'em 75. 
- Thought you gave 50. 
- No, some-
- well, somebody. 
- No, don't fight with a judge. 
- All right, whatever you say. Anyways, Your Honor-
- 
- All right, well, let me tell-
- Let me tell you what happened. You got the ticket, right? 
- Yeah. 
- And you paid it. 
- Yeah. 
- But when you paid it, 14 days had expired. Listen to me. 14 days. They give you 14 days to pay the ticket. 
- Okay. 
- If you don't pay it in 14 days, it doubles. So what happened was the ticket doubled 'cause you didn't pay it in 14 days, so you paid $25. 
- Right. 
- Right? Then they sent you a notice saying, You owe us another 25 'cause you paid that one late. Then you didn't pay that one for 14-
- Then you waited 14 days and you paid that one. So they took that 25 and they sent you another notice saying, You paid the second 25, but you didn't do it within 14 days. 
- It's worse than Bank of America, you know what I mean? 
- You're gonna pay 25 for the rest of your life every two weeks. 
- Right, exactly. 
- All right, I'm gonna dis-
- I'm gonna dismiss the balance. 
- All right. 
- Not only that, I'm gonna give you a credit. I'm gonna give you a credit for the extra 25 that you paid. 
- All right. 
- Because you have a red light violation. 
- There you go. 
- This is on Smith and River. 
- Right. 
- Do you wanna tell me anything about that? 
- Yeah, I'm gonna tell you about that. I was on my way-
- 
- It's your daughter again. I can tell. 
- No, listen. I was on my way to, uh, say a prayer for you and for everybody, to Saint Jude Novena up on... on, uh, Chatham Street. 
- You prayed for me? 
- Yeah, of course. And, uh... anyways. The, uh-
- I had bad news from my doctor. 
- If he's praying for me, he's gotta go back, do a little more. 
- Listen, I had bad, bad news from my doctor. I was stopped at the red light, first of all, and I'm looking at it. I wasn't texting. I was just looking to see what the-
- what I had to pick up and stuff. And then I see the light's green, so-so I put it down, then all the sudden it turned red, boom. 52 years I wait my life to see you. 
- (chuckling) 
- 52 years. 
- You never had a-
- 
- And I'm-
- And I'm French. 
- You never had a moving violation? 
- Never, never. Except for that stupid parking ticket over there. I thought they were gonna hang me for that. 
- We're gonna take a look at it, Mr. Brousseau, okay? We're gonna take-
- 
- Oh, no, I definitely-
- I definitely went through it. 
- Well, let me take a look at it. 
- Okay, if you want. The light is yellow. It's red. Boy, you were speeding. 
- No, I wasn't. 
- Wow. How fast was he going? 
- (man) 34. You were doing 34 miles an hour. Look at that. 
- Maybe I did go through it. I don't know why I'm arguing with you. Anyways. 
- Wait a minute. You just said to me you were looking down. 
- What I thought, yeah. 
- You went right through the light. 
- Saint-
- Saint Jude wasn't driving, right? 
- No, Saint Christopher, he jumped out of the car a long time ago. 
- (Quinn) He jumped out? He saw you were driving, he jumped out. 
- Inspector Quinn, we have the-
- we have the Saint Jude defense today. 
- (Bertrand) Anyway. 
- You keep looking. 
- I don't know. Now I can't even see my car. 
- Anything else you wanna tell me? 
- Nah, just tell me how much. 
- All my friends are Italian. They all grab my money. You know what I mean? 
- Ohh... 
- (chuckling) 
- Your Honor, you're doing a good job. And these-
- the warm-up, you have this guy here, I don't know how come he gets paid but to warm-
- warm us up. 
- (Quinn) Wow. He's the warm-up. 
- Now you're-
- Now you're, uh, buttering me up. 
- Yeah, there you go. I want his job. Look at all the-
- 
- (Judge Caprio) Oh, yeah, now. 
- Look at the electricity we're paying for. 
- Now you're-
- It's my brother. 
- Ahh, that's why. 
- You're trying to take my brother's job? 
- Nah, nah. Why don't you get a haircut though? Ooh. 
- You guys are tough on all these other people. Be tough on me. Arrest me. 
- The parking ticket has been-
- has been paid. I'm gonna dismiss that. 
- Okay. 
- All right. The red light violation. It's your first one in 52 years. 
- Yeah. 
- You paid $25 extra for the, uh... for the parking ticket. So here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna charge you $35 court costs on the red light, give you a $25 credit that you paid for the parking ticket. So it's gonna cost you $10. 
- For the whole thing? And hey, give me the 10. 
- (Quinn) Your Honor-
- 
- Give me the 10 out of your pocket. You said it'd be less than that. 
- Good luck. 
- Thank you, Your Honor. 
- (laughing) 
- Even though Mr. Brousseau is French and Joe is Italian, they have one thing in common. They love to bust ba-
- excuse me-
- bust chops. 
- Hey, there you go. I want his job. 
- Now you're-
- It's my brother. 
- Ahh, that's why. 
- You trying to take my brother's job? 
- Nah, nah. Why don't you get a haircut though? Ooh! 
- When's the last time you had a brain scan? Kid looks like a movie star-
- one that gets killed in the first act. 
- They are definitely brothers from another mother. Mr. Brousseau, I have known Joe for over 20 years, and trust me, it will take more than a prayer to Saint Jude to get the 10 bucks from him. It will take a miracle. See, I can bust ba-
- excuse me-
- chops too. 
- I was fired from my job. 
- You're in jeopardy now of having the second car forfeited to a tow company.

- Lisa Pearson. Lisa, you're charged with going through a red light on Service Road 8 and Broadway... on July 15th. Let's take a look at this. Light is yellow. It's red. And you almost made it. Red, Your Honor, now. Here's her vehicle. See where your vehicle is? And the light just turned red. 
- First of all, I'd like to let you know that I'm on disability. Second of all, I had my niece and my nephew over, and I believe they took my car because I haven't had any violations on my license in at least five to seven years. So they asked me if they could take the car. I told them no, so I believe they did it without my permission. And I believe that he's the one 'cause I don't recall going through no red light. 
- This was at, uh, like, 5:00 in the evening. Would that be you? 
- Yeah, I-
- no. I don't believe it was me. I believe the kids took the car. I call them kids 'cause they're younger than me. 
- Yeah. 
- But, uh... But, uh... 
- You also have a ticket for parking in a loading zone on Union Street. I'm gonna dismiss the loading zone ticket. 
- Thank you, Your Honor. 
- But when your name came up, they picked put his old ticket. I'm gonna dismiss it. 
- Oh, thank you so much. 
- All right, now we have to get back to the big-
- big guns here. This red light violation, okay? I believe you, all right? But here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna charge you $35 court costs, and get it from them. You hear me? 
- Yes. 
- 'Cause you are responsible if someone who drives your car-
- 
- Your Honor, I can't afford it really because I'm on disability. And I only have, uh, 75¢ on me until my check comes the 1st. I don't have any money. And then I-
- I bought my car, and, uh, I-
- 
- Lisa, Lisa, Lisa, Lisa. I-
- I'm dismissing it. 
- Oh, God bless you. Thank you, Your Honor. 
- And good luck. 
- I really, really appreciate letting me be able to not have to pay the fine because I... I don't have the means. 
- All right, it's okay. 
- I'm struggling. And I'm trying to get my condition together with my disability, so... 
- (Judge Caprio) Good luck. 
- ...I'm trying my best. Good luck to you. 
- Thank you so much again. 
- Bye-bye. 
- Have a great day. 
- Patricia Lovely. 
- Morning. 
- Morning, Patricia. You have two red light violations and three parking tickets. 
- I thought I was coming in because I hadn't gotten a ticket in so long and I was going to talk to you about the good driver thing, and then-
- 
- Yeah. 
- I-
- then-
- 
- You got two red lights. 
- I know. 
- I'm gonna dismiss one. 
- Okay, thank you so much. 
- All right, now what do you want to tell me about the parking tickets? 
- Just that, you know, I-I-
- It was right when they started doing that thing where they-
- you had a parking spot and you had pay down the street somewhere, and I had no idea how to do that. 
- Oh, the multi-spacace meter. 
- Yeah. But I did do it, and I know that that was this-
- it was back then when they started doing that and I didn't know anything about all that. 
- Well, they got 'em at three different locations. It's not one location. 
- I know, I know. No, I know. I'm bad-
- it's my bad. I'm just really happy to-
- I wanna clear my slate. 
- Are you ready to confess? 
- I am. I feel like this is confession. 
- Inspector Quinn, we have a confession. 
- (laughing) Your Honor, it's been a while since I've been to confession, so, uh... 
- (Judge Caprio) Oh. ...I can't fault the motorist. 
- Well, while you're confessing, we have a number of unsolved crimes upstairs. Do you wanna confess to any of those? We could clear them all out. 
- Okay. 
- What do you think, Inspector Quinn? 
- That-
- I will accept that confession, Your Honor, all day long, to clear the desk. 
- All right, I'm gonna fine you $85 for one of the red lights and $30 for one of the parking tickets. 
- I appreciate that. 
- So it's gonna cost you $115. 
- Okay, thank you very, very much, sir. 
- Good luck to you. 
- Okay. 
- I know you can't be his girlfriend because basketball is his girlfriend. If I was standing next to you, I wouldn't wear that T-shirt. 
- Thank you. 
- Donna Morales. Good morning, Donna. 
- Good morning. 
- Donna, your car was, uh... towed. It was booted first. It wasn't paid. As a result, it got towed. 
- Correct. 
- The car got towed... last month? 
- Yes. 
- Why did it take you a month to come in here on this? 
- Well, Your Honor, I just, uh-
- I was fired from my job. I didn't have a job. Um-
- 
- No. Well, let me go through this. Your car was booted... two months ago? 
- No, that's, um, the Nissan. I have my Infinity that was just booted last week. 
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute. There are two vehicles here? 
- Yes, two vehicles, but-
- 
- Let me go through this slowly. The first vehicle is a Nissan. I'm just-
- I just know what I have before me. 
- Correct. 
- It appears that that car was blooted-
- booted a couple of months ago. 
- Correct. 
- And then towed. 
- Correct. 
- It's still at the tow company? 
- Correct. 
- Are you here for that vehicle? 
- No, I'm not. Unfortunately, I-
- The reason why it got towed and I didn't come in-
- I was not able to register. I was in the process of registering. I bought it from a dealer off of the Internet. And something was wrong with the title that-
- so it looked like three people were on there. I was dealing with Miss Mancini from the DMV. She said, unfortunately, we couldn't get it registered. 
- Oh, you bought a car. To use-
- To use the street language, the car was a gaffe, right? 
- Basically, yes. And-
- 
- So, all right. They had trouble with the title. You bought it online. You couldn't get it cleared. All right, I understand all that. So you forfeited that car. 
- Right. 
- The tow guys got it, right? 
- Right, so that's why I didn't. 
- So you said, Keep it. I don't care about it. 
- 'Cause you can't-
- the DMV said I can't register it. 
- And... on the Infinity, you had 11 tickets. None of which were paid. Most of them were overnight parking outside your house. 
- Yes, Your Honor. My landlord, uh-
- I tried to file for the, um-
- to see if I can get the overnight parking ticket, but because we-
- there's six apartments in my house, the landlord had to go down and do something, they said. He finally just did it now. And I lost my job. That's why I didn't come in. I'm just back to work, so now I can take care of the parking tickets and everything. I'm not here to give you an excuse. I'm fully responsible for it and willing to pay. 
- All right, Donna, you're in jeopardy now of having the second car towed and forfeited to a tow company. 
- Correct. 
- So what do you wanna tell me about these? Did you come prepared today to-
- prepared to pay-
- to pay for the boot to be released? 
- I have right now $300, Your Honor, that I can give, and then I could come back every week and make a payment towards them tickets-
- 
- Your record hasn't been that good. You know that? 
- I know, I know. 
- But you changed. 
- I-I have a good job. I lost my job. I got a-
- I'm back to work. I am not losing-
- I'm not gonna lose my job. I have no other choice. But... But I will be making the payments, Your Honor. 
- In your defense... In your defense... 'cause I really wanna be fair with you, okay? Almost all of these tickets are parking in front of your house overnight. And I have some sympathy for you because of that. 'Cause we have an ordinance in Providence that you cannot park overnight on the streets in Providence. And I know that many-
- many landlords don't have sufficient number of parking spaces for their tenants and the tenants have no choice but to park on the street. All right, the original tickets are $835. The original tickets. All right, I'm gonna dismiss a number of the tickets on Monticello Street. It's gonna cost you a $100 boot fee, $300 for the tickets, and I'm gonna release the boot as soon as you pay the 300, which will be today, okay? 
- Okay. 
- You have a $100 balance. You're gonna have a $100 balance. 
- Okay. 
- Try to pay that as quick as possible so that you can buy a parking pass so you can park the car in front of your house for a year. Okay, so as soon as you pay the other 100, you'll be eligible to buy a parking pass. 
- Okay, I can pay that next Friday, Your Honor. Thank you so much. 
- Good luck. 
- Thank you. 
- I'm trying to help you to help yourself, so, please, help yourself. 
- I definitely will. I definitely will be here Friday to pay that $100. 
- Okay, good luck to you. 
- Thank you so much. 
- Good luck. 
- Thank you. 
- Rayelle Fernandez. This is a parking ticket on Benevolent Street. 
- Yes, I never received it. I just received the paper in the mail, so we came in today to take care of it. 
- All right. So you're looking to waive the penalties. 
- Yes, sir. 
- Yes. 
- All right. Who was driving the car? 
- He was. 
- (Judge Caprio) You? 
- Yes, sir. I was at work. I work for a moving company. 
- Now who's this? 
- This is Rayelle. 
- I'm the owner of the car. 
- Are you friendly? 
- Yeah. 
- Oh. I work for a moving company. 
- I know you can't be his girlfriend because basketball is his girlfriend. 
- No. 
- I mean, I'm not sure-
- I don't want to get involved here in any personal matters, all right? 
- No, I coach basketball, sir. 
- Well... 
- I coach. 
- You know, just in case she was disillusioned, thinking that she had a chance here, right? His girlfriend is basketball, so-
- And he's proud of it. See, so, I don't know. If I was standing next to you, I wouldn't wear that T-shirt. 
- Thank you. 
- Well, I think you should discuss this after you leave. If you need a mediator, I'll mediate it, okay? 
- (Rayelle) Okay. 
- All right. But I'm gonna waive the penalties. 
- Thank you. 
- So she did a good job talking for you. I'd change that shirt. All right, it's $20. 
- Thank you. 
- Thanks a lot, Your Honor.

'Bout damn time! [Music] We represent our hood tonight [Music] [Music] Come on, we represent our hood for life... [Music][Music] Welcome back. Let's get you caught up. Morgan and Jay have worked through their issues, and are on the up and up. What's my favorite color today? Pink. Yup. But Corey seems to be the pain in their ass that won't go away. Chad and Nicole's relationship is moving to the next level, taking each other's measurements. Wow, you (bleep) it up. I had it. No, here. I got it. I'm gonna measure it for you, you (bleep) ding-a-ling. Janelle's still running hot after attacking Diandra for kissing her ex Darian. And Farrah's discovering her ripped-up posters, which was payback by Nurys for being kicked in the cooter. Oh, my God. Someone came up here and (bleep) up my signs. All right, so that's the (bleep) you started! Did she (bleep) do this? She might have did it, Farrah. Okay. Well, this is the best one. Did someone (bleep) up my-
- okay. All right. Don't attack all of my amazing, amazing signs... that my housemates spent their time on making for me. Did someone have an idea to (bleep) bend all my signs? ■ I (bleep) did! I did! I happily (bleep) did! I did, I did, I did, I did! Nurys did! She kicked me. She decided to put her hands on me, so I grabbed her free Farrah posters and I ripped them in half. Stop! No! You think I give a (bleep)? You think I give a (bleep)? No, no, no, no! Nurys, no! Diandra, Diandra! I know! If you wanna touch my stuff, your (bleep) gets a big (bleep) you down the toilet. Okay, touch my (bleep), bitch. Touch it, I dare you. somebody else's (bleep). I did. You ugly-ass bitch! Oh, I'm ugly, bitch? How much plastic surgery have you had to fix your face and your body? I haven't done not one thing to my body or my face and I'm (bleep) gorgeous, so (bleep) my (bleep), bitch. You (bleep) disgusting bitch. Sure, sure, I'll take your (bleep). I'll take your (bleep) and put it in the toilet. If she touches my (bleep), I'm letting you guys know, I'ma beat this bitch's ass. Go ahead, Farrah. Put that (bleep) in the toilet. o Here it goes. Here it (bleep) goes. Come on, sis. Here it goes. Put that (bleep) in the toilet. She (bleep) bent every one. She (bleep) your ex, sis! She bent! She bent! Disrespect me, disrespect my stuff, you will not be respected. And, um, karma's a bitch. Oh, (bleep)! She ripped her (bleep). Here we go. Here it goes. Here you go. Farrah's said she ripped it all up. If you argue with Farrah, she will kick you in the vagina and put your shoes in the toilet and flush. That's some pussy-ass (bleep). I've never done something so crazy like that. It's bad enough that Farrah already kicked me in the vagina. Now she's grabbing my sneakers and she flushes them down the toilet. I could've touched her makeup that was there, or any of her personal belongings, and I didn't, because I have some type of class. Don't threaten me! Don't trip me! Don't (bleep) attack me! Since fighting is a big fat no-no, Janelle, Nurys, and Farrah are sent to hotels for the night with a warning. Talk (bleep), get hit, bitch. I'll see you tomorrow 'cause we always keepin' positive things. I love you. Mwah! Love you too. You guys think the, like, Farrah-Nurys situation is gonna continue today or-
- Oh, yeah, 100%. She's in a very precarious legal situation right now. Don't be coming around kicking anyone. But, like, I just got-
- like, this is childish. Okay, but if you got kicked in the cooter, what would you (bleep) do? I'ma kick you back in the cooter. Farrah went back, and then the security guard was there. She tripped over his feet and Farrah fell on her ass. Well, good thing she's got those airbags back there. No, she-
- yeah. Did she bounce? My ex is definitely coming before yours. One of 'em. One of 'em is coming and it's gonna (bleep) up everything. I don't want Chad's ex coming into this house. I will literally ruin this girl's life if she thinks for one second that she has any upper hand on me when it comes to Chad. I will rip her to shreds. We still gotta have-
- we're still going to the sauna. I know. That's still a date. Exes coming in. ■es, exes. At the end of the day, we're just these, like, what? Skin blobs floating around on this planet that's going through space through a round of ball of fire? Like, and that's life, and then you die. You know, eventually. Thanks for the deep thoughts, Einstein. We to that point yet? Yeah. We can have sex really close to people? We are? Okay. Come here, Corey. We're gonna have sex on top of you. You're our first victim. Those guys are so cute together. I'm peanut butter and jealous of their relationship. I really don't have feelings for Sh And Morgan, she's kinda boo'd up with Jay. I'm peanut butter and jealous of their relationship. You know, hopefully I can findn and be a cute couple. Oh, my God! What relationships are gonna get messed up today? Ahh! Please not me. I'ma say Morgan. I'm feeling it. Don't wield that (bleep). Chad has not been to the beach yet. It has to be Chad. (bleep)! Oh, my tits look so good! (bleep)! (bleep). So who's the last person? Please not me. Please. (bleep)! (bleep)! Why? Aw, damn it. Oh, my God. Just give me a little bit of time before another one comes. Can I just enjoy my peace? Bring up some men. Bye, girls. Bye. Bye, Morgan. Be good. Good luck. (Morgan)I have so ms in this house. Like, Corey needs to go home. So I am worried. I feel like I have finally gotten to a good place with Jay, and I just-
- I don't want an ex to come and screw that up. Best-case scenario is that it's somebody else's ex, not mine, and I can just go back in the house and have fun with Chad, and not have anybody try interrupting my little honeymoon. How y'all feeling? Terrible. I'm clueless. You're clueless? For sure. I don't need a third, Romeo. I think me and Jay are on good terms finally. So Corey's not confusing things for you? Um, I just don't think it's gonna work between me and him. Nicole, how are things with you and Chad? We're good. I feel like you're gonna (bleep) it up though, so bring on the exes. By the end of this whole experience, some of you may find new love, rekindle with an old love, or just say (bleep) love. But the real question: Are you completely over your ex? It's time. No. Let's bring 'em out. (bleep). My ex coming in? Like, he doesn't need to be here. Just throw him back in the water. It's like, how much more can I take? I haven't cracked yet, but I feel like if an ex comes out of the water, I might reach my cracking point. [Music] Fun, everybody love a bomber, balls are great... [Music] Oh, that's not my ex! Yeah, that's not mine either. [Music] Go ahead, treat yourself... [Music][Music] My name is Monte, from Memphis, Tennessee, and you may know me from Big Brother: Over the Top. Being a southern gentleman is about treating a girl right. Opening the door for her, not cussing, acting a fool in front of her, but also smacking her ass as she walks through the door. Me and Morgan met in the Big Brother house. We dated for six months and then she decided she wants to move to L.A., so that kind of put a, you know, rut in the groove. I'm here to not only rekindle me and Morgan, but I know for a fact that Morgan is the one I wanna settle down with. And I'm at that point in my life where I'm ready. What's up, man? Doing good. What's going on, Monte? How do you like seeing Morgan over there? She looks pretty good, man. Stop. Yeah? Yeah. Why you here? Gotta get her back, man. Get her back? Yeah. He's trying to get you back! Great opportunity to take her back. It is, man. Once in a lifetime. Ugh! What happened between y'all two? I ended up moving to Los Angeles. It was too much of long distance got in the way and-
- So you left him hanging? It was too hard being so far apart. Seeing Monte brings back a lot of good memories. We don't really have any fights. You real flustered right now, like-
- Yeah, G because I'm alreG with two exes, You real flusand now you'reGg i. right now, like-
- But this connection seem genuine right here. Even from the other ones, I'm feeling something. I think there is a genuine connection, but it's difficult because I got some issues back at the house. Don't play with Jay's feelings. I think that this is something between Jay and Morgan that can potentially ruin them. We got some things to figure out. I'm done. (bleep), (bleep)! No, Morgan! (bleep)! Uh-oh! Guess what day it is? Guess what day it is! Huh...anybody? Julie! Ah come on, I know you can hear me. Mike Mike Mike Mike Mike... what day is it Mike? Ha ha ha ha! Leslie, guess what today is? It's Hump Day. Whoot Whoot! Ronny, how happy are folks who save hundred of dollars switching to GEICO? I'd say happier than a camel on Wednesday.

[SFX] Introducing new Hershey's Milk Chocolate e's Pieces Now in one bar u's Pieces So how you been? I've been good. It's been an experience, to say the least. Um, I'll go ahead and fill you in since Romeo told me I need to be honest. Yeah, shoot me straight. Don't lie to me. I feel like I'm an emotional wreck at all times in this house. It's like I'm the only person with three exes. Some people don't even have one ex and I'm dealing with three. Like, I need to get Corey out of this house, and he's honestly pretty boring. Jay came in the house. I kind of rekindled things with him. Then Corey came in, so it was kind of like... Double whammy. ...a weird messy love triangle. But I thought I had it figured out till you walked up on the beach. Me and Monte had a great relationship before this. It didn't end badly. My family loves him. He's unfortunately the exact kind of guy that my dad would want me to marry, which is terrifying. You're my girl. Everything happens for a reason. So I really think, you know, Jay might be cool, but, you know, you gotta remember back to what we had too. We could rekindle that even better. I don't know who this Jay guy is, but, uh, he's gonna have to run for his money, 'cause, uh, Monte's coming. Give me a fair shot. That's all I ask. Okay. And I promise you, you'll reconsider. [Music] Let's go [Music] [Music] It[Music] It's time to go, go, go, go, whoa [Music] [Music] Do you wanna, do you wanna go? [Music][Music] How you feeling though this morning? I'm cool. Like, the only thing I was actually, like, I was thinking about, like, last night, was, like, no one ever pulled her to the side and was like, Yo, I understand you're upset, but, like, how you're reacting, like, that's not okay. Depending on how Janelle comes back from the hotel, I'm hoping to see, uh, a new-
- a new person. Uh, the girl that I used to know. Here we go. Oh, (bleep)! Oh, Nicole! Sha! Chad, you're safe! So Nicole is back now and she doesn't have an ex, and I'm just like, Thank God I don't have to deal with that situation. So how did the guy look? Tell me. Does he look cute or whatever? I'm kind of scared for Jay. Why? He said he's here to get her back, and he's here for no other reason but to get her back. Oh, (bleep). Honestly, it should be called Morgan's Ex on the Beach. Like, how many exes do you have, girl? Like, just stop. All right, pull the chair, pull the chair, pull the chair. Hold on. Hey, Morgan. Take a seat. Let the man do the talking. Gah damn. This Monte character? (grunts) Damn! Ugh! Um, I will say this. All the boys you brought into the house are fine as (bleep). And-
- yes. So at least I have good taste. What are you here for? What are your intentions? What are my intentions? Are you here to be with her? ■÷ Are ■; to rekindle that fi? Hell yeah, man. I'm gonna rekindle the fire. What are you talking about? Okay, there we go. Oh, I'm gonna be just Mr. Tough Guy here to steal your girl. I'ma flirt with her in front of you and I'm gonna pretend like I'm not. Ha ha! I'm so cool! Clown. If things don't work out with Jay, are we allowed to take him into our relationship? You're allowed to take him right now if you want. We can share. Oh, God, it's so sweet it's making me sick. Let's see if everyone else can be so levelheaded as Janelle, Farrah, and Nurys return from their stay at the hotel. Baby, baby, baby! Hey! ç■■7■7's Janelle. Hey! Whoo! What's up? So I've had a night to cool down, relax. Going in the house, for me, it is stressful because I'm dealing with the fact that I really am, like, heartbroken for real. Diandra, can I talk to you? Yes. My main point to pull Diandra aside was to apologize to her and let her know that, hey, I know we've had our beefs in the past. Like, I know we personally don't care for each other, but the attack I made on her was not personal at all. So basically I just wanted to genuinely apologize for putting my hands on you. Like, my issues are with him. Like, I should conduct myself better just as a human being. You (bleep) kiss her?! You're gonna kiss her?! That is her ex. Oh, (bleep). Oh, you ain't tell me that. (bleep) you laughing, bitch?! Janelle! Janelle! Janelle! You (bleep)hole! So I apologize. I accept your apology. Um, I wasn't laughing at you. Like, I'm sorry. Like, when I get nervous, I'm like... But I literally-
- all I said, I looked back, like, this is crazy. And thankful that you came to apologize for putting your hands on me. No problem. Like, I meant it, but I shouldn't be hitting people. I saw Janelle go up to Diandra, apologize for the whole thing, argument they had, and just literally broke down. And you know what? It takes a grown person to apologize and to admit that. I accept your apology. With me, if someone says sorry and they genuinely mean it, ■ I will forgi With me,Will I forget?ys sorry and No. I'm not stupid. it, I will definitely keep my eyes up open, but the minute you say sorry, all right, clean slate. I'ma do a handshake. Okay. We'll take it slow. Yes. Okay. Okay, thank you. All right. Now that Janelle and Diandra are on the same page, the house vibes seem to be in a good place. Maybe Farrah and Nurys can squash their beef too? Hello, house. Hey, Farrah. Hello. There's another one. So I'm back today and I'm going in the house and I'm just staying away from literally everything, everyone, and (bleep) them. Aww. Have a drink. I'm back. I'm back. I'm extremely happy that Nurys came back here. She did nothing wrong, but I understand as to why she had to leave. But I am genuinely upset that Farrah is still here. I'm gonna go ahead and leave it in the fate of the Lord and He will take care of that. Karma's a bitch. Good. So if I started talking to another girl, she'd probably find out. Hey, can we talk? Hi, how are you? Sure. In private? Okay. I don't have to (bleep) apologize because I reacted like a normal human being, but better than a normal human being, 'cause a normal human being wouldn't have stopped (bleep) hitting her. Actually, a normal human being probably wouldn't kick someone in the vagina. I guess I just wanted to ask where your head was at yesterday. 'Cause I'm confused as to where all that animosity came from. All that, like-
- Okay, so I'm not confused. I'm very aware about what happened yesterday. When I come in to just hear what my friend's ex-boyfriend is saying, all I'm hearing is insults, um, from you about me, acting like you know me. I think-
- That all was brought up afterwards, so that's not what we're talking about. And continuation of that and that was-
- No, see, now you're trying to play victim. That's not what we're gonna do. So I'm not a victim. So I know you were just drinking. I'm not drinking. Okay. Okay. I'm wide awake. I have no patience for that. I apologized for you insulting me, you touching me. No. See, that's that-
- no, no. And I'm the bigger woman. Okay. Ha, okay. So I'm a real woman who knows what really happened. Okay, okay. You're out of control. Oh, my God. She's literally delusional. So stop. Get in control. This bitch is delusional, yo. Okay! Farrah does not care abo anye except for herself and s■■@@@@@. ■d■d■d■d■d■d■d■d■d■d■d■■d■■d■■d. Bitch, you're the trash. You kicked me in the vagina because I was having a conversation with someone. Like, (bleep) psychotic. Get ahold of yourself, out-of-control groupie. What's wrong? No, she's still lying and is a trash can. I know I'm a bigger person. She's a whore. Do I need to apologize to someone who put that on themselves, who caused that for themselves, who (bleep) deserves worse than what she got? No. Lash Paradise Mascara from L'Oréal Paris.

No, no matter what happens here, I'm not gonna bull(bleep) you about that. I'll tell straightforward. I know that. I feel really bad for Jay right now. 'Cause I can imagine being a man hearing that, saying you're only half of what I want. If I, and it's making me contemplate what kind of person Morgan i I've only been here for two hours and this place is losing its mind. I am already starting to see it looks like a hornet's nest. Whoo! Dessert time, people! So they bring up this big pink cake, and I'm like, Thank you? We just heard a lot of people like to have their cake... And eat it too. ...and eat it too, people.

- I haven't said anything different when I was yelling yesterday. No, honey, I am not a hooker. But you're a porn star! How can you even have your opinion? I am not a hooker. The next person that calls me-
- Do not call me a hooker, because you do not know me... (bleep)! ...because you were the one masturbating on a video! (bleep) you. Okay? That's all I can say about that. If a ex pop out, I (bleep). Wait, I think thaI think it is.■■at's what Ohh... Pretty sure that's a bottle. Girl, get-

In a living room far, far away, the exes lean into the dark side as they strategize which single they should get revenge on. I know you're gonna say Farrah, but you gotta look at it from this point of view. Yeah, she causes a lot of (bleep), but y'all let her. Like, y'all let-
- listen. Y'all let her words actually eat up. Y'all, y'all take, like-
- y'all act like her words matter. You only got here yesterday. That's what I'm saying. Mm-hmm. You haven't seen the whole thing about her. She is nasty as a human being. Nasty. I haven't really got an opportunity to talk to Darian. He was hanging around Malcolm a lot, and everyone knows that Malcolm comes with Diandra and Nurys. You're not making it easy for me to forgive you, because I'm continuously watching you around people that I don't like. I just don't think it's fair! Morgan, you are much stronger than this, babe. Come on! Okay. You know what? I said this whole entire time I was not gonna reach my breaking point. And congratulations, Ex on the Beach. You officially broke me. What else can I do to screw up? I feel like I screw up everything! No. No, you don't. Just let her cry. She just needs to cry, honestly. Let it out. I think right now Morgan actually feels genuinely sorry and bad.

Before the break, the exes found out that they all had power for tomorrow's elimination, which is bad news for some of our misbehaved singles. You know, I tried so hard in this house to be positive and happy. 'Cause the last thing I wanted to do was come in this house and lose myself. And now I feel so lost. I know I don't have a say with the exes, but I want Corey out before Farrah. To me, he doesn't contribute anything. He has the personality of a (bleep) pet rock. And I feel like Jay's pissed with you just because, like-
- Why would he be pissed with me? I feel like he's pissed at you and her because-
- Not at me. She was kissing back. It wasn't like a-
- she said it was a snipe. It wasn't a snipe. It wasn't a snipe at all. When you're in this house, you kind of know that evI mean, yeah,onna be revshe could focus on Jay.,..■s But honestly, like, what's she gonna look at? You know what I'm saying? It's hard for me to deal with the house and all this and me and you haven't gotten anything, like, resolved. Resolved. That (bleep) pisses me off 'cause it's like I'm over here dying inside. Darian knows that I do not allow a man to not be accountable fowrongdanise thatt go it again. Like, I need you to repent to me like I'm Jesus. When are you gonna fight for me here instead of involving yourself in (bleep) that don't (bleep) matter? When the (bleep) are you gonna fight for me? You don't even know what you want. When we originally broke up, she left me, literally. But now I feel like she kind of wants the best of both worlds. The onlymatters is me can't strictly talk about me and you right now, then I will just go to bed. That's fine. Okay. Good-bye. Like, this is (bleep). That (bleep) again, man. Let it go. Are you good with us being done, yes or no? Of course not, Janelle. I feel like we're still up in the air. It could go left, it could go right. At the end of the day, Yeah,I'm my own man. know?

I'm just gonna go eat up all my sausage. See you later. We both haven't got sausage in a long time. You know when you're hung over and you get ready and you don't even remember getting ready but you just kind of come to as you're looking good and you're like, Yeah? Yeah. It's nice. It's so weird that an OG might leave. Might? Is. So if I am really up for elimination, I'm not worried about it, but I'm prepared, and I'm G a pantsuit tonight. In all Farrah-ness, I don't really feel like I should be leaving. Punted her straight in the pooter. I don't think I did. What am I gonna do to a girl's crotch? The whole thing with Nazarian or whatever her name is-
- 3v3v3va Nazar-
- N-Na-
- Something with an N. Just keep thinking her name is like Nazarian. It's like my plastic surgeon. I really-
- I'd rather be thinking about that than whatever she's about, so... What's up, gangsta? What's going on? Talk to me. I'm just, like, drained emotionally. I just didn't wanna get to that point yesterday and I did, and now I feel like I, like, can't be myself. What do you want with us? I don't know. You don't trust me anymore. It's like-
- You honestly believe that I don't trust you at all? I don't know. I just wish you were more honest with me. I would prefer the truth. Not 10%, 50%, 90%. Give me the whole damn thing. Just wanna say sorry. I didn't wanna put you through all this. Do I still want affection and touch her all the time and hug and (bleep)? Hell yeah. So I'll give her a shot. I'll give her a chance again. But... I still care about you. It's like, are you happier with me here? Yeah, what are they gonna do? Send me a new blond? We know where Jay stands, but the rest of the exes are still making up their minds. I just wanna know where-
- what-
- like, where your heads are at and why you would-
- you know, like, who you guys wanna vote out and, like, why? The only singles on the chopping block are Corey and Farrah. Corey because Morgan wants him out. She doesn't feel that she can continue her relationship ay while he's here. And Farrah is on the chopping block. It's 'cause she kicked my girl in the vagina and she needs to (bleep) off. Morgan's like, Someone help me, please. But she's not actually physically getting attacked, and it's bull(bleep). You know I get your side, and I feel so bad for Morgan that she's gotten bull(bleep) after bull(bleep) after bull(bleep). But to be honest, she did not get this physically attacked. That's so (bleep) up that any of you guys are even deciding for even the slightest (bleep) bit. Seriously? I don't understand why people wanna get Corey out. Corey hasn't done anything. Faa crazy, delusional bitch. ■#■# She's the one that's the problem. It's the craziest thing you guy We're supposed to be exes and we're supposed to stick together, correct? Correct, and none of you guys had my back. It's the biggest bull(bleep) ever. Even though I know she hurt you, and, like, Farrah did do things wrong, everyone's done a couple things wrong, and at this point, like, it's like we're not all gonna come to one. I think we should all just vote what we think at this point. So I'm just gonna go ahead and crush Farrah just because I feel like Farrah, if you're gonna respect her, she'll respectight back. She treats all of us pretty good other than the people that she doesn't like, which is everyone for the most part. I shouldn't have to (bleep)-
- this should be easy. It shouldn't even be a question. I totally understand why you want her out. I wish y'all would just talk it out. But you don't even wanna talk to me, so... I thought she did try to talk to her. She did try to talk to Farrah, and Farrah just blew-
- I already know I'm the bigger person. I don't need to. I'm not going up to the bitch again. And yes, I will call her a bitch 'cause she's a bitch. Like, I really don't care. It sucks to see that people don't have my back. I haven't done anything to deserve that. HAVE YOU BEEN TOLD YOU CAN'T GET HIGH SPEED INTERNET WHERE YOU LIVE? WELL@>N WITH HUGHESNET GEN 5.

I think that's kind of passed, so... Honestly, I think that people are, like, trying to protect Morgan, but she's, like, you know, a little bitter at this point, I think, and she, like, wants to get me out now. I'm shocked that I would even be up to be eliminated, really. ? But as I am, I'm ready to defend myself. I'm here to stay. What up? What up, everybody? Looking good.

And if the vote results in a tie, the power will revert to the remaining singles. ■■■nd new l■ rekindle with a, or just say (bleep) love. By the end of your time here, we're gonna put you through the ultimate test. I've tried real hard to campaign to get Corey out of this house. Be able to a!■ Before we get to these votes,c. anybody wanna say anything? I would like to make a speech. Wow. Okay. A speech. Yeah. So it's a keep Farrah campaign. But does she forget we already voted? If I, Farrah, am here to stay, I pledge unlimited grocery shopping, live-in maid. Also lots more toilet paper, cleaner, and air spray. We gotta wrap it up in a second. Okay, all right. All who voted for me to be eliminated will be on trash duty and be shunned. ■Aaa■■ Honestly, in my heart of hearts, I don't want either Farrah or Corey to go. Farrah, we gotta take a seat right there. Thank you. All right. Whoo! Thank you. So funny. So funny. All right, all right, we gon' get back to it. Let's get started. Jozea. ■C■C■C You already know what it is. You good. Nothing's in there. No cut or no crush. Yes. You are safe, Jozea. Maya, Malcolm, Nicole, Cheyenne, Chad... ■t have nothing in your pineapple. Which means you are safe. We will got a lot of chips still out there. With that being said, Morgan, please step up to your pineapple. So how would you like the vogo tonight? I honestly would like Corey to go home. It's nothing against him, but I have three exes in the house. Three is enough. Are you ready? Yeah. You got a chip. But it's a crush. lause) Duh. But it's a crush. Have a seat. So, Janelle, you've been in the middle of a■8drama this week. Mm-hmm. Why don't you step up to your pineapple? Sure thing. See how this goes. Think you have a? Maybe. You never know. Let's get to it. Hold on. You got a chip. But it's a crush. Wow! I said actions, people. I said actions. You got a crush, which is a sign of love. (bleep). You better crush all this. You are safe. Have a sanelle. I'm just saying. Look at smile, man. You see that? Changes everything. He's trying to get his (bleep). We finally got a chip. YeahThank you.y is. Hey, Romeo.

Oh. I did. Oh, (bleep). Wow. Winning! So you gave the crush vote to Janelle? Yes, I did. What I respect about her is that she apologized ra. I could not do anything but respect that, so■2 I gave you that crush vote. is that she apologized ra. (applause) Darian ain't getting his (bleep). I am pissed because Darian was going to fully take the credit for that crush, but instead of wasting it on someone that you barely even know, it's like, put it towards me to show me that, like, you care. Corey, please step up to your pineapple. If I had to guess, you got some chips in there. Yeah. Let's get to it. First chip, cut. Got another chip... which is a cut. You got two cut votes, which means you're on the hot seat. Take a seat. I might be going home because of, like, her messiness, and it's just not that I would have to potentially go home. It'd be stupid for them to kick me out of the house 'cause I never cause drama. Like, I'm here to date, you know, maybe find love. So, next, Farrah. Please step up to your pineapple. You think you have I mean, I hope I havesh votes, some crush votes. cut votes?■ All right, you ready to get to it? Yeah. First one. I'm so over Farrah! You're giving everybody a hard time. You are a (bleep) person to everybody. You kicked one of my closest friends he house in her vagina. You need to get the (bleep) out. Previously on Ex on the Beach, ten incredibly single and available reality stars are looking for love while living with their exes. Jozea and his ex Rob had an emotional reunion at the beach. Are you about to cry? Aww! Farrah wouldn't let Nurys and Darian have a private conversation. I don't know why the (bleep) you're coming out here. So Farrah kicked her in the privates. Anto vote out Farrahet in the flipped elimination when the exes got the power to vote out one of the singles. after trying to get in the way Coreof Morgan and Jay's seat■ relationship. So now him and Farrah are both in fear of elimination, and one of them is going home. [Music] Who knew that the devil wore red? [Music] [Music] Silk dress, yeah, she always is a mess [Music] [Music] She more petty than the rest [Music] [Music] Heartbreaker... [Music][Music] Welcome back. It's elimination night, and this time, the exes are<<e by giving them a crush vote or a cut vote. Nelson put his crush in Janelle's pineapple as a way to thank her for taking the high road after her fight with Diandra. Darian tried to take credit for it until he got called out. OF, EY DIDN'T OWN ANYTHING, THEY WEREN'T WEALTHY LANDOWNERS, THEY DIDN'T HAVE PROPERTIES OR ANYTHING AT STAKE IN CUBA, AND THEY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO JUST AN HOUR NORTH AND THEN GET A BETTER LIFE UH, FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILY, VERY TYPICAL THING THAT DREW PEOPLE HERE FOREVER. GATES: THAT'S A BIG HOUR THOUGH, MAN. RUBIO: IT IS. IT'S A BIG JUMP AND I'M SURE THOSE EARLY YEARS WERE, WERE DIFFICULT FOR THEM. GATES: MARCO'S PARENTS STRUGGLED MIGHTILY TO MAKE IT IN AMERICA, MOVING FROM NEW YORK TO MIAMI TO LAS VEGAS, WORKING IN CASINOS AND HOTELS. IT WAS AN IMMENSE EFFORT. BUT EVEN SO, THE COUPLE TOOK GREAT CARE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR CHILDREN DIDN'T SEE THEIR EXPERIENCE AS A LIABILITY. RUBIO: I NEVER REMEMBER GROWING UP FEELING LIKE I WAS LIMITED BECAUSE MY DAD WAS A BARTENDER AND MY MOM WORKED AS A MAID AT THE IMPERIAL PALACE. SOMEHOW THEY WERE ABLE TO INSTILL IN US THE BELIEF THAT THERE WAS NOBODY WE SAW ON TELEVISION THAT WE COULDN'T BE ONE DAY. GATES: THAT'S FABULOUS. MY PARENTS WERE THE SAME WAY. THERE WAS NOTHING THAT WE COULD ASPIRE TO THAT WE COULD NOT ACHIEVE. RUBIO: YEAH. GATES: NOTHING. RUBIO: THAT'S A REAL GIFT. GATES: BUT WHERE DO YOU THINK IT CAME FROM IN YOUR CASE? RUBIO: I DON'T KNOW, UM. GATES: I MEAN IT'S KINDA CRAZY WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT. RUBIO: WELL I THINK IT WAS JUST KIND OF THE POINT OF MY PARENTS' LIFE. THEY TRIED A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS, AND I THINK THEIR FEELING WAS WE WOULD HAVE THE CHANCE TO DO THINGS THEY NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO DO, BUT INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, THEY NEVER HAD A SPECIFIC DREAM FOR US, THEY JUST WANTED US TO HAVE A DREAM, WHATEVER THAT WAS, AND KINDA PURSUE IT. GATES: MARCO, OF COURSE, DID INDEED FIND HIS OWN DREAMS TO PURSUE. AFTER GRADUATING FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI LAW SCHOOL, HE ENTERED POLITICS, RISING TO BECOME ONE OF ONLY A HANDFUL OF LATINOS IN THE U.S. SENATE. LOOKING BACK, HE REMAINS INTENSELY GRATEFUL TO HIS PARENTS, AND SEES HIS SUCCESS AS A VALIDATION OF THE CHOICE THEY MADE IN IMMIGRATING, AND OF THE NATION THEY CHOSE AS THEIR NEW HOME. RUBIO: AMERICA IS THIS ONE PLACE WHERE YOU SAID TO PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD UH, MAYBE YOU LIVE SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY WON'T LET YOU BE WHO YOU KNOW YOU CAN BE BECAUSE YOUR FAMILY ISN'T THE RIGHT PEOPLE. BUT HERE IT DOESN'T MATTER, HERE WE'RE GONNA JUDGE YOU BY HOW HARD YOU'RE WILLING TO WORK NOT ON WHAT YOUR LAST NAME IS OR WHERE, WHAT YOUR GREAT-GRANDFATHER DID. GATES: MY THIRD GUEST IS HAWAIIAN CONGRESSWOMAN TULSI GABBARD. GABBARD: ALOHA. GATES: A RISING STAR ON THE NATIONAL STAGE. TULSI COMES FROM A MILITARY FAMILY, AND FOLLOWED THAT SAME PATH HERSELF. SHE JOINED THE ARMY NATIONAL GUARD IN 2003, WHEN SHE WAS 22 YEARS OLD. THE NEXT YEAR, THE MAJORITY OF HER UNIT WAS SELECTED FOR SERVICE IN IRAQ, BUT TULSI WASN'T, SO SHE MADE A BOLD DECISION. GABBARD: I KNEW VERY QUICKLY THAT THERE WAS NO WAY THAT I COULD STAY BACK IN BEAUTIFUL HAWAII AS YOU KNOW, MY FRIENDS AND BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN UNIFORM DEPLOYED. GATES: SO YOU VOLUNTEERED. GABBARD: SO I VOLUNTEERED. I CALLED MY COMMANDER AND I TOLD HIM. I HAVE TO GO WITH YOU GUYS. AND, AND HE SAID, NO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO. AND IT TOOK A FEW CONVERSATIONS FOR ME TO GET HIM TO UNDERSTAND THAT I WAS NOT GOING TO STAY HOME. GATES: TULSI WAS SENT TO A BASE IN IRAQ NICKNAMED MORTARITAVILLE DUE TO FREQUENT ENEMY ATTACKS. SHE SERVED IN A FIELD MEDICAL UNIT, OBSERVING CASUALTIES AND INJURIES ON A NEAR DAILY BASIS, CONFRONTING FIRSTHAND THE REALITIES OF WAR. GABBARD: IT REALLY SHOWS YOU WHAT'S IMPORTANT IN LIFE AND, UM, THE SMALL THINGS FALL AWAY. GATES: YEAH. GABBARD: WE HAD A BIG SIGN IN OUR CAMP RIGHT ON ONE OF THE GATES WHERE THE PATROLS WENT IN AND OUT, BIG BLACK LETTERS. IT SAID: IS TODAY THE DAY? GATES: WOW. GABBARD: AND IT WAS AN EVER-PRESENT REMINDER OF HOW FRAGILE LIFE IS AND THAT OUR TIME COULD COME AT ANY MOMENT, SO MAKE IT COUNT. DON'T TAKE ANYTHING FOR GRANTED. GATES: TULSI TOLD ME THAT HER SERVICE WAS A MAJOR MOTIVATION IN HER DECISION TO RUN FOR CONGRESS, DRIVING HER TO RECONSIDER AMERICA'S MILITARY POLICIES IN TERMS OF THEIR IMPACT ON SOLDIERS AND CIVILIANS. GABBARD: WHAT WILL THE COST OF THIS BE, DEVASTATION TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, TO THE WORLD, AND WHAT, FOR WHAT? GATES: A NOTION THAT TRULY HIT HOME WHEN SHE RETURNED TO HER FAMILY, AND SAW HOW POWERFULLY HER ABSENCE HAD AFFECTED THEM. GABBARD: WHEN I CAME HOME FROM MY FIRST DEPLOYMENT. WE PROBABLY LANDED AT 3 OR 4 IN THE MORNING. WE SAW THE SUN RISING AS WE WERE MARCHING INTO UM, THIS HUGE HANGAR WHERE ALL OF OUR FAMILIES WERE GATHERED. AND AS SOON AS THE GENERAL SAID THAT WE WERE DISMISSED, UH I RAN TO MY FAMILY AND MY DAD WAS THE FIRST ONE THAT I HUGGED AND UM, HE WAS SOBBING. I DIDN'T, I DIDN'T KNOW HOW, YOU KNOW, I WAS SO FOCUSED IN MY WORLD AND WHAT I WAS DOING I DIDN'T FULLY REALIZE UNTIL THAT MOMENT HOW ANXIOUS AND STRESSED AND WORRIED THEY WERE. GATES: AFTER SPENDING TIME WITH MY GUESTS, I WAS STRUCK THAT EACH HAD BEEN MOLDED AND MOTIVATED BY ADVERSITY. AS I DUG INTO THEIR ROOTS, I FOUND THAT THEIR FAMILY TREES WERE FILLED WITH PEOPLE WHO SHARED THAT TRAIT. BUT THEIR STORIES HAD LARGELY BEEN FORGOTTEN. IT WAS TIME TO UNEARTH THEM. I STARTED WITH PAUL RYAN. AS HIS NAME SUGGESTS, HIS FATHER'S FAMILY IS IRISH, AND PAUL IS WELL-VERSED IN THEIR EXPERIENCE. HE'S EVEN VISITED THE TOWNS IN IRELAND WHERE THE RYANS ONCE LIVED. HIS MOTHER'S ROOTS, HOWEVER, ARE A DIFFERENT MATTER. HE KNOWS THAT SOME OF HER ANCESTORS WERE GERMAN, BUT LITTLE MORE. SO WE BEGAN WITH HIS MATERNAL GRANDFATHER, WHOM PAUL LOVED, AND WHOSE NAME WAS PARTICULARLY GERMAN. THAT'S DR. ADOLPH HUTTER. RYAN: MHMM. CAN YOU IMAGINE HIS NAME WAS ADOLPH HUTTER? GATES: I KNOW. WOW. THAT'S... RYAN: HE WAS IN THE US NAVY IN WORLD WAR II. GATES: THAT'S TOUGH. RYAN: YEAH. GATES: AND YOU'VE WRITTEN THAT GROWING UP YOUR GREATEST ASPIRATION WAS TO BE LIKE DR. ADOLPH HUTTER. RYAN: YEAH. GATES: TELL ME ABOUT THAT. RYAN: I ADORED THE MAN. UGH, HE, HE, LIKE MY MOM, HE WAS A REALLY CHIPPER, HAPPY, FUNNY GUY, VERY SMART, UM, WARM. PEOPLE LIKED BEING AROUND HIM, UM, I JUST ADORED HIM. GATES: PAUL HAD BEEN TOLD BY HIS RELATIVES THAT THE HUTTER FAMILY ORIGINALLY IMMIGRATED TO THE UNITED STATES FROM BAVARIA. BUT HE DIDN'T KNOW WHEN THEY CAME, OR ANYTHING AT ALL ABOUT THE DETAILS OF THEIR JOURNEY. WE FOUND THE ANSWERS IN A PAMPHLET, WRITTEN BUT NEVER PUBLISHED BY ADOLPH'S GRANDFATHER, A MAN NAMED JOSEPH HUTTER. RYAN: I WAS BORN JUNE 17, 1848 IN GERMANY AND IN 1854 WE CAME TO AMERICA. I HAD NO IDEA THEY CAME THAT EARLY. IN 1854, WE CAME TO AMERICA STOPPING AT HAVERSTRAW, NEW YORK STATE UNTIL 1855. GATES: HAVERSTRAW IS ABOUT 40 MILES NORTH OF NEW YORK CITY, BY THE WAY. RYAN: OH OKAY. NEVER HEARD OF IT. WE TRAVELED BY RAIL TO MILWAUKEE. WE WERE PENNILESS, AND IN ORDER TO CONTINUE OUR TRAVEL TO MADISON BY RAIL, WE HAD TO PLEDGE ALL OF OUR PERSONAL BELONGINGS, SUCH AS BEDDING, ETCETERA, FOR WHICH WE RECEIVED $12, AND THIS TOOK US TO MADISON, WISCONSIN. THAT'S AN IMMIGRANT STORY IF THERE EVER WAS ONE. MAN, THAT'S A GREAT STORY. I LOVE THAT STORY. GATES: HAPPILY FOR PAUL, HIS ANCESTOR'S STORY WAS ABOUT TO GET EVEN BETTER. ACCORDING TO JOSEPH, THE HUTTERS CAME TO WISCONSIN TO SETTLE IN SAUK COUNTY, WHERE THERE WAS A GROWING COMMUNITY OF GERMAN IMMIGRANTS. BUT BY THE TIME THEY REACHED MADISON, THEY WERE PENNILESS ONCE AGAIN, AND SAUK COUNTY WAS OVER 50 MILES AWAY! THEY HAD NOTHING LEFT TO SELL, SO THEY CONTINUED THEIR JOURNEY, ON FOOT. JOSEPH WAS ONLY SIX YEARS OLD AT THE TIME. RYAN: THEY WALKED 50 MILES. GATES: YEAH 50 MILES. THEY HAD NO MONEY. CAN YOU IMAGINE? RYAN: NO. GATES: AND IF WE DO THE MATH, JOSEPH'S MOTHER WAS LIKELY PREGNANT WHEN THE FAMILY IMMIGRATED AND WHEN THE FAMILY WAS MAKING THAT 50 MILE WALK TO SAUK COUNTY. CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT? TALK ABOUT TOUGH. RYAN: WOW, WOW. PREGNANT WALKING 50 MILES TO PLAIN, WISCONSIN FROM MADISON. IT'S A PRETTY HILLY AREA TOO. I KNOW THAT SPOT. WOW. GATES: WE NOW TURNED TO THE ARCHIVES, TO COMPARE JOSEPH'S ACCOUNT WITH THE HISTORICAL RECORD. THE 1860 CENSUS SHOWED JOSEPH AS AN 11-YEAR-OLD BOY LIVING ON THE SOUTH EDGE OF SAUK COUNTY WITH HIS PARENTS: JOHN AND BARBARA HUTTER. THEY ARE YOUR THIRD GREAT-GRANDPARENTS. RYAN: DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT. DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THEIR NAMES. WOW. THAT'S REALLY SOMETHING. GATES: NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING REALLY COOL. COULD YOU PLEASE TURN THE PAGE? RYAN: ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. GATES: SOMETHING YOU NEVER DREAMED YOU'D SEE IN YOUR WHOLE LIFE. PAUL, YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE PASSENGER LIST, RYAN: OH REALLY? GATES: FOR A SHIP CALLED THE CAESAR, IT ARRIVED AT THE PORT OF NEW YORK ON JUNE 20, 1854. RYAN: HOW THE HECK. HOW DO YOU GUYS GET THIS STUFF? HOW DO YOU DO THAT? GATES: WOULD YOU PLEASE READ WHO WAS ON THAT SHIP. RYAN: THERE YOU HAVE IT RIGHT THERE. JOHANNES HUTTER, 42, FARMER, BARBARA, 42, MICHAEL, 9, JOSEPH, 5. GATES: YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE RECORD OF THE MOMENT THAT YOUR ANCESTORS FIRST STEPPED FOOT IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. RYAN: WOW. WOW. THE CAESAR PASSENGER MANIFEST. GATES: MM-HMM. RYAN: THAT'S AMAZING. GATES: THE HUTTERS ARRIVED IN AMERICA WITH NO MONEY AND NO CONNECTIONS, AND FOUND THEMSELVES NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THE ECONOMIC LADDER. BUT THEY DIDN'T STAY THERE FOR LONG. PAUL'S GREAT-GREAT GRANDFATHER JOSEPH WOULD RISE UP, WORKING FOR A BRICK MASON BEFORE FOUNDING HIS OWN CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS, AND ASSURING HIS FAMILY'S SUCCESS. RYAN: WOW. GATES: WHAT'S IT LIKE TO SEE THAT? RYAN: I THINK IT'S A BEAUTIFUL STORY. I JUST LIKE THE FACT THAT I'M A PART OF THE WOVEN FABRIC OF THE COUNTRY. I THINK THAT'S JUST REALLY INTERESTING. I THINK IT'S REALLY INTERESTING. GATES: YEAH, YEAH ME TOO. RYAN: IT'S NEAT TO SEE WHAT PEOPLE DO TO MAKE A BETTER LIFE FOR THEMSELVES AND HOW HARD IT WAS TO GET GOING IN THIS COUNTY, TO GET THINGS STARTED. GATES: YEAH AND THEY RISKED EVERYTHING. RYAN: EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING. GATES: AND THEY WERE JUST GLAD TO BE HERE. RYAN: THEY WALKED 50 MILES. GATES: AND THEY WALKED 50 MILES, YEAH. RYAN: WHAT ARE THEY DOING, HOW DID THEY DO THAT? YEAH. IT'S NEAT. GATES: IT'S INCREDIBLE. RYAN: YEAH IT REALLY IS, IT REALLY IS. GATES: UNLIKE PAUL, MARCO RUBIO KNOWS THE IMMIGRANTS IN HIS FAMILY TREE. THEY'RE HIS PARENTS, WHO CAME TO THE UNITED STATES FROM CUBA IN 1956. BUT MARCO'S DEEPER ROOTS WERE LARGELY A MYSTERY TO HIM. AND AS WE BEGAN OUR RESEARCH, WE SOON UNDERSTOOD WHY. HIS FATHER, MARIO RUBIO REINA, LOST BOTH OF HIS PARENTS BY THE TIME HE WAS A TEENAGER, AND ENDED UP LIVING ON THE STREETS OF HAVANA. A TRAUMA SO DEEP, IT WAS RARELY DISCUSSED. RUBIO: I KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT HIS UPBRINGING. I KNOW HIS MOTHER DIED WHEN HE WAS VERY YOUNG OF TUBERCULOSIS OR SOME LUNG DISEASE. AND THEN UH, HIS FATHER AT SOME POINT REMARRIED, AND UM, AND THEN, WHEN HE WAS STILL VERY YOUNG, CERTAINLY BEFORE HE WAS 18, HE MOVED OUT WITH ONE OF HIS BROTHERS AND LIVED SOMEWHERE ELSE. YOU KNOW, THIS IS A GUY 14, 15 YEARS OF AGE ON HIS OWN. GATES: AS IT TURNS OUT, MARCO'S FATHER WASN'T THE ONLY ONE IN HIS FAMILY TO SUFFER SUCH LOSSES. WE DISCOVERED THAT BOTH OF MARIO'S PARENTS WERE ORPHANED AT AN EARLY AGE, MEANING THAT AT LEAST TWO GENERATIONS OF MARCO'S ANCESTORS HAD TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES AS CHILDREN. RUBIO: YOU CAN BEGIN TO SEE WHY SOME OF THESE STORIES WERE NOT TOLD, ESPECIALLY THEY DIDN'T HAVE, IF THEIR, IF THESE KIDS WERE VERY YOUNG WHEN THEIR PARENTS DIED THEY JUST PROBABLY DIDN'T KNOW AS MUCH ABOUT THEIR PARENTS AND COULDN'T PASS IT DOWN. AND IT CERTAINLY EXPLAINS A LOT ABOUT, MY, MY FATHER CERTAINLY WASN'T, I DON'T THINK HE WAS ASHAMED OF HIS FAMILY'S HISTORY, HE JUST WASN'T A PROMINENT FEATURE. YOU WOULD THINK HE KIND OF, YOU KNOW, JUST APPEARED ON THE EARTH ONE DAY AND THERE WAS NOTHING THAT CAME BEFORE IT OTHER THAN VERY VAGUE NOTIONS. GATES: AND WHO WANTS TO REVISIT ALL THAT PAIN? RUBIO: YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. GATES: THAT'S SAD. RUBIO: IT IS. GATES: I WANTED TO RECOVER THE STORIES THAT MARCO'S FAMILY HAD LOST AMIDST ALL THIS TRAGEDY. ONE STOOD OUT AS ESPECIALLY MEANINGFUL. IT CONCERNS HIS THIRD GREAT-GRANDFATHER, A MAN NAMED JOSE DE REINA Y TOSTA, WHO WAS BORN AROUND 1760 IN SEVILLE, SPAIN. JOSE'S BIRTHPLACE WAS NOT UNEXPECTED, AS MANY CUBANS HAVE SPANISH ANCESTRY, BUT HIS OCCUPATION TOOK BOTH OF US BY SURPRISE. RECORDS SHOW THAT HE RECEIVED A LAW DEGREE FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF GRANADA. RUBIO: OH WOW. HE'S A LAWYER. GATES: 1786. RUBIO: SO MY GREAT
- GREAT GRANDFATHER, MY THIRD GREAT-GRANDFATHER, WAS A LAWYER? GATES: HE GOT A LAW DEGREE 200 YEARS BEFORE YOU DID. RUBIO: WOW. WELL, WE WAITED LONG ENOUGH. THAT'S UNREAL. THAT'S REALLY AMAZING. GATES: YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE THE FIRST LAWYER. RUBIO: I THOUGHT I WAS. GATES: WRONG. RUBIO: THE FIRST IN TWO CENTURIES. BUT UH, WOW. GATES: AND GUESS WHAT? HE WENT ON TO BECOME A PUBLIC PROSECUTOR. IN THE YEAR 1793 HE WAS ADMITTED TO THE ATTORNEYS PROFESSIONAL GUILD IN SEVILLE, AND HE WENT ON TO BECOME A PUBLIC PROSECUTOR. RUBIO: SO, THERE YOU GO. WELL, IT'S THE FIRST TIME I READ ANYWHERE THAT ANYBODY IN MY FAMILY HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH GOVERNMENT UP UNTIL ME. GATES: JOSE NEVER REACHED THE HEIGHTS THAT HIS DESCENDENT MARCO HAS REACHED, BUT HIS CAREER IN GOVERNMENT WAS MARKED BY ONE INCREDIBLE ACCOMPLISHMENT. IN THE EARLY 1830S, JOSE WAS SERVING IN MURCIA, A PROVINCIAL CAPITAL, WHEN A CHOLERA EPIDEMIC STRUCK THE CITY. AMIDST STAGGERING CASUALTIES, JOSE FOUND HIMSELF THRUST INTO THE SPOTLIGHT, COORDINATING HEALTH AUTHORITIES, THE POLICE, AND THE COURTS, AS OTHER HIGH-RANKING OFFICIALS DIED OR FLED. RUBIO: SO HE WASN'T JUST A GUY THAT WAS THERE, PUNCHING THE CLOCK. GATES: YOU'VE HAD TO DEAL WITH HURRICANES. RUBIO: YEAH? GATES: CAN YOU RELATE TO HIS HANDLING OF A LARGE-SCALE CRISIS? RUBIO: YEAH, EXCEPT THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES WE HAVE, YOU KNOW? GATES: YEAH. RUBIO: I MEAN JUST IMAGINING HOW THIS THING WAS SPREADING, PROBABLY HAD PEOPLE CLOSE TO HIM. THEY WERE LIVING THE TRAGEDY ALONG WITH HAVING TO ADMINISTER IT. YOU KNOW, PEOPLE YOU KNEW, PEOPLE THAT WORKED FOR YOU ALL OF A SUDDEN GOT SICK, SO YOUR WORKFORCE WAS UNDER ATTACK. IT MUST'VE BEEN AN EPIC CRISIS AND VERY DIFFICULT TO HANDLE, BUT HE COULD'VE LEFT AND HE STAYED. GATES: HOW'S THAT MAKE YOU FEEL? RUBIO: I GOT SOME SHOES TO FILL, HUH? GATES: JOSE SURVIVED THE EPIDEMIC, LIVING UNTIL HE WAS ABOUT 70 YEARS OLD. HIS SON, MARCO'S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDFATHER, ALSO TOOK UP GOVERNMENT WORK, SERVING IN THE PAY CORPS OF THE SPANISH ARMY. SURVEYING THEIR LIVES, MARCO WONDERED HOW THESE ANCESTORS MAY HAVE INFLUENCED HIM, EVEN THOUGH THEIR STORIES HAD BEEN LOST. RUBIO: THOSE CAMPAIGNS THAT I RAN MY DAD LOVED THEM, I MEAN HE LOVED BEING INVOLVED IN IT AND LOVED DOING IT. I CAN'T IMAGINE HE KNEW ANY OF THIS, LIKE NO ONE'S EVER TOLD US ANY OF THIS. SO IT JUST KINDA TELLS YOU THAT SOMEWHERE, YOU KNOW, IN, IN THEIR BLOOD BACK THEN IT WAS SOMEONE WHO CARED ABOUT AND WAS INVOLVED IN GOVERNMENT SERVICE AND, AND THEN THERE WAS THESE THINGS THAT MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THREE GENERATIONS TO DO IT, AND THEN SUDDENLY YOU PUT SOMEONE IN THE RIGHT ENVIRONMENT AND THEY WIND UP, YOU KNOW, IN THE US SENATE. THAT'S JUST UNBELIEVABLE. GOD. WOW. GATES: LIKE MARCO, MY NEXT GUEST, HAWAII'S TULSI GABBARD, SEEMS TO HAVE INHERITED A CALL TO SERVE. INDEED, THE VERY REASON THAT THE GABBARD FAMILY ENDED UP IN THE PACIFIC AT ALL LIES WITH THE MILITARY. TULSI'S GREAT-GRANDFATHER, A MAN NAMED BENJAMIN GABBARD, CAME TO SAMOA AS A SAILOR WITH THE U.S. NAVY. AND WHILE ON LEAVE, HE VISITED THE ISLAND OF APIA, WHERE HE MET A LOCAL RESIDENT. A WOMAN, NAMED CARRIE BARTLEY. WE PICK UP THE COUPLE'S STORY IN A 1920 EDITION OF THE SAMOA TIMES. GABBARD: A MAN-O'-WARSMAN SPENT HIS WEEKEND AT APIA. DURING HIS SHORT STAY HE WAS MARRIED TO A SAMOAN BELLE, THE BRIDE WAS MISS CARRIE BARTLEY, THE BRIDEGROOM, MR. B.H. GABBARD, WAS ATTENDED BY A NUMBER OF HIS COMPANIONS IN THE U.S. NAVY. GATES: THAT'S YOUR GREAT-GRANDPARENTS' WEDDING ANNOUNCEMENT. ISN'T THAT COOL? GABBARD: THAT IS COOL. SAMOAN BELLE. GATES: SAMOAN BELLE. GABBARD: LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN THE SOUTHERN BELLE. GATES: INDEED. THE NAVY WAS THE ONLY REASON THAT HE WAS IN SAMOA, WITHOUT IT YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN BORN. SO THANK GOD FOR THE NAVY. GABBARD: YES. GATES: TO TRACE THE ROOTS OF TULSI'S GREAT-GRANDPARENTS, WE FOUND OURSELVES EXPLORING ARCHIVES SCATTERED ACROSS THE GLOBE. BENJAMIN'S ROOTS STRETCH THROUGH KENTUCKY, VIRGINIA AND PENNSYLVANIA TO GERMANY! CARRIE'S MOTHER WAS A SAMOAN NATIVE, WITH ANCESTORS WHO HAVE LIKELY BEEN IN THE PACIFIC ISLANDS FOR CENTURIES. AND CARRIE'S FATHER, A MAN NAMED CHARLES BARTLEY, WAS BORN IN A PLACE THAT TULSI HAD NEVER ASSOCIATED WITH HER FAMILY. WANT TO TAKE A WILD GUESS WHERE WE FOUND HIM? I'LL GIVE YOU A NICKEL. GABBARD: I DON'T KNOW. CALIFORNIA? GATES: YOU LOSE. GABBARD: I OWE YOU A NICKEL. GATES: YOU OWE ME A NICKEL. PLEASE TURN THE PAGE. TULSI, ON THE RIGHT IS A BIRTH REGISTER FROM THE YEAR 1858. WOULD YOU PLEASE READ THE TRANSCRIPTION? SURPRISE. GABBARD: BIRTHS IN THE DISTRICT OF AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND. GATES: TULSI, YOU HAVE ROOTS IN NEW ZEALAND. THIS IS WHERE YOUR PEOPLE COME FROM. DID YOU HAVE ANY IDEA? GABBARD: NO. NO. WOW. THIS IS REALLY COOL. GATES: CHARLES BARTLEY IS TULSI'S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDFATHER, AND HIS BIRTHPLACE POSED A QUESTION: HOW DID SOMEONE BORN IN NEW ZEALAND IN THE 1850S END UP STARTING A FAMILY IN SAMOA IN THE 1880S? THE ANSWER LAY IN A SAMOAN ENCYCLOPEDIA, WHERE CHARLES' LIFE SOUNDED LIKE THE PLOT OF AN ADVENTURE NOVEL. GABBARD: MR. CHARLES BARTLEY, STOREKEEPER AND TRADER, OF SALANO, SAVAII, WAS BORN IN AUCKLAND IN 1857, BUT WAS EDUCATED IN APIA, HAVING BEEN ONLY FIVE YEARS OLD GONE WITH HIS PARENTS TO SAMOA. AT TEN YEARS OF AGE, HE RAN AWAY TO SEA AND SPENT 12 YEARS IN A ROAMING LIFE. GATES: WHAT A STORY! ACCORDING TO THIS ENCYCLOPEDIA, YOUR FAMILY LEFT NEW ZEALAND FOR SAMOA SOMETIME AROUND 1862, WHEN CHARLES WAS FIVE YEARS OLD. BUT CHARLES DIDN'T STAY LONG IN HIS NEW HOME. AS THIS TELLS US, AT THE AGE OF TEN HE WENT TO SEA. CAN YOU IMAGINE? A TEN-YEAR-OLD ON A SHIP? GABBARD: GOSH. NO. GATES: HOW DO YOU THINK STORIES LIKE THIS ARE LOST? GABBARD: I DON'T KNOW. I THINK THAT MY PARENTS THEY'RE HUMBLE PEOPLE AND I THINK SOMETIMES NOT DOCUMENTING AND NOT TAKING THE TIME TO FOCUS ON THIS BECAUSE YOU'RE FOCUSING ON WHAT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU STORIES LIKE THIS PROBABLY, UM, FELL TO THE BACK. GATES: WHAT'S YOUR DAD GOING TO MAKE OF THIS STORY? GABBARD: I THINK HE WILL BE MIND-BLOWN. GATES: WE CAN'T VERIFY THE ENCYCLOPEDIA'S ACCOUNT OF CHARLES' ROAMING YOUTH, BUT WE DO KNOW THAT HE DID, IN FACT, SETTLE IN SAMOA AND THAT HE DID INDEED BECOME A TRADER. WE ALSO KNOW THAT AS AN ADULT, CHARLES FACED A DAUNTING CHALLENGE, ONE THAT WOULD HAVE SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE TO TULSI. IN 1905, A SAMOAN VOLCANO ERUPTED, SENDING LAVA RUSHING STRAIGHT TOWARDS CHARLES' DOOR. GABBARD: LAVA SPREADS OVER ISLAND. THE VOLCANO ON THE ISLAND OF SAVAII IS STILL ACTIVE. SOME PERSONS WILL NOT LEAVE THEIR HOUSES UNTIL THE DWELLINGS ARE ACTUALLY SET ON FIRE BY THE BURNING LAVA. THE LAVA HAS DESTROYED ALL OF SALAGO, INCLUDING THE HOME OF MR. BARTLEY, A WELL-KNOWN RESIDENT. GATES: CHARLES LOST HIS HOME. GABBARD: GEEZ. GATES: THIS ERUPTION WAS HUGE INTERNATIONAL NEWS, AND YOUR GREAT-GREAT-GRANDFATHER CHARLES WAS MENTIONED BY NAME IN MANY ARTICLES, IN MANY NEWSPAPERS. IN FACT, A PHOTO OF HIS HOUSE RIGHT BEFORE IT WAS DESTROYED MADE IT INTO AN AUSTRALIAN NEWSPAPER CALLED THE TOWN AND COUNTRY JOURNAL. THERE IT IS ON THE LEFT. GABBARD: MR. H. C. BARTLEY'S HOUSE, TAKEN AT 1 PM ON SATURDAY, JANUARY 27, 1906. LAVA CAN BE SEEN OVER THE BUGGY IN THE DISTANCE, SOME 60 YARDS AWAY. THE HOUSE WAS BURNED AND STONE COVERED HALFWAY UP THE WINDOWS AT 11 O'CLOCK THE SAME NIGHT. GATES: CAN YOU IMAGINE? GABBARD: SADLY I CAN BECAUSE WE ARE LITERALLY SEEING THIS HAPPENING ON HAWAII ISLAND. GATES: RIGHT NOW. GABBARD: RIGHT NOW. I WAS JUST THERE AND BOTH FLEW OVER AND WALKED ON THE LAVA THAT HAS BEEN SPOUTING. GATES: WOW, THAT'S AMAZING. GABBARD: AND IT'S JUST YEAH, BEEN INCREDIBLE TO SEE HOW COMPLETELY IT HAS CHANGED EVERYTHING. I MEAN HOUSES THAT I SAW, FARMS THAT I SAW DURING THE FIRST WEEK OF THE ERUPTION NOW ARE, IT'S LIKE THEY NEVER EXISTED. GATES: THE VOLCANO ON CHARLES' ISLAND CONTINUED TO ERUPT FOR SIX YEARS, AND DESTROYED MUCH OF WHAT HE OWNED. BUT TULSI'S ANCESTOR REFUSED TO FOLD . GABBARD: MR. BARTLEY IS THE LARGEST LOSER BY THE PRESENT VOLCANIC ERUPTION, HAVING HAD HIS TWO STORES AND CONTENTS BURNED, AND HIS BOAT HAS ALSO GONE. MR. BARTLEY, HOWEVER, IS MADE OF STERN STUFF AND IS NOT DISCOURAGED. HE IS NOW PREPARING FOR A FRESH START BEYOND THE REACH OF THE PRESENT VOLCANIC OUTBREAK. GATES: STERN STUFF. GABBARD: TRULY A TOUGH GUY. GATES: YEAH. DOES THIS SOUND LIKE ANYBODY IN YOUR FAMILY? GABBARD: OH, YES. GATES: PRETTY COOL. GABBARD: YES. THAT'S REALLY SPECIAL. GATES: WE HAD ALREADY TAKEN PAUL RYAN BACK TO HIS GREAT-GREAT-GRANDFATHER, JOSEPH HUTTER, A GERMAN IMMIGRANT WHO FOUNDED A CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS IN WISCONSIN. NOW, WE WANTED TO GO FURTHER ON THIS LINE, TO SEE WHERE EXACTLY THE HUTTER FAMILY ORIGINATED, AND TRY TO LEARN WHY THEY MADE THEIR JOURNEY TO AMERICA. THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE LONG ANIMATED PAUL. AS, GROWING UP, HIS GERMAN ROOTS WERE NEVER AS MUCH-DISCUSSED AS HIS IRISH HERITAGE. RYAN: I ALWAYS WONDERED WHY THEY IMMIGRATED. I DIDN'T KNOW. BECAUSE I KNOW THE FAMINE IRISH. I KNOW THE IRISH STORY. THAT'S A PRETTY SIMPLE STORY, YOU KNOW. GATES: YEAH, SURE. RYAN: BUT I NEVER REALLY KNEW THE BAVARIAN STORY, BUT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THAT OR NOT. YOU'RE GONNA GET THERE. GATES: WAIT AND SEE. RYAN: I HAVE NO CLUE. I DON'T WHY. GATES: TRACING PAUL'S FAMILY IN GERMANY WOULD PROVE TO BE A SUBSTANTIAL TASK. WE KNEW THAT JOSEPH HUTTER ARRIVED IN NEW YORK IN 1854, BUT HIS ARRIVAL RECORD DIDN'T NAME HIS HOMETOWN. SO ALL WE HAD TO GO ON WAS A FAMILY STORY THAT THE HUTTERS ORIGINALLY CAME FROM BAVARIA. FORTUNATELY, BAVARIAN CHURCHES KEEP VERY GOOD RECORDS. RYAN: JOHANNES HUTTER, BORN JANUARY 6TH, 1812 IN HOCHABRUNN. PARENTS: JOHANNES HUTTER, WEAVER, WEAVER IN HOCHABRUNN, AND HIS WIFE MARGARETHA. GATES: YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE BAPTISMAL RECORD... RYAN: HOW DO YOU GUYS GET THIS STUFF? GATES: FROM 1812 FOR YOUR THIRD GREAT-GRANDFATHER, YOUR GREAT-GREAT
- GREAT-GRANDFATHER'S BAPTISMAL RECORD. RYAN: HOW DID YOU GET THAT? YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME. GATES: AND JOHANNES OF COURSE BECAME KNOWN AS JOHN. RYAN: YEAH. MY GOSH. GATES: WE NOW KNEW THAT PAUL'S ANCESTORS CAME FROM HOCHABRUNN, A VILLAGE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE TOWN OF WALDMUCHEN IN EASTERN BAVARIA. AND THIS ALLOWED US TO PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT TO HIS FAMILY'S DECISION TO EMIGRATE. BY THE TIME THE HUTTERS LEFT, IN 1854, MOST OF HOCHABRUNN'S POPULATION WERE TRADESPEOPLE OR TENANT FARMERS, EARNING A MEAGER LIVING, OFTEN STRUGGLING SIMPLY TO FEED THEMSELVES. THEY LEFT LITTLE EVIDENCE OF THEIR LIVES BEHIND, BUT PAUL WAS THRILLED TO SEE ANYTHING WE COULD FIND. RYAN: JOHANNES HUDERER. BORN JANUARY 29, THAT'S MY BIRTHDAY. GATES: OH, WOW. RYAN: 1788 IN HOCHABRUNN. PARENTS: JOHANN, OH MY! GATES: YEAH, JOHANN. RYAN: JOHANN ADAM HUDERER, WEAVER IN HOCHABRUNN, AND HIS WIFE BARBARA. GATES: THIS IS ANOTHER BAPTISMAL RECORD, FOR YOUR FOURTH GREAT-GRANDFATHER. RYAN: FOURTH GREAT-GRANDFATHER. GATES: YEAH, JOHANNES. AND NOW... RYAN: NOBODY IN MY ENTIRE FAMILY KNOWS ANY OF THIS STUFF. NOBODY KNOWS THIS STUFF. GATES: WOW, THAT'S GREAT. WELL YOU JUST MET ANOTHER GENERATION OF YOUR FAMILY, YOUR FIFTH GREAT-GRANDPARENTS, HIS PARENTS JOHANN ADAM HUDERER, ANOTHER WEAVER AND HIS WIFE BARBARA, BABL, JOHANN OR ADAM AS HE WAS KNOWN, WAS BORN APRIL 1, READY FOR THIS? 1757 IN HOCHABRUNN. RYAN: 1757. GATES: 1757. THAT'S 18 YEARS BEFORE THE BATTLES OF CONCORD AND LEXINGTON. RYAN: YEAH, RIGHT, RIGHT. MY GOSH. GATES: IT'S AMAZING. WHAT'S IT LIKE TO SEE THAT DOCUMENT? RYAN: I DON'T KNOW. I CAN'T, I NEVER, I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU TO DO THIS. WOW. THAT'S REALLY SOMETHING. I DON'T REALLY HAVE WORDS FOR THIS. I'M AMAZED YOU FOUND THIS STUFF. GATES: YOU HAVE DEEP ROOTS IN GERMANY AND WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE BUT WE THINK THEY CAME FOR ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES SENSE. RYAN: THAT'S MY GUESS, I GUESS. I MEAN, YEAH... GATES: LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY.. RYAN: POOR FARMERS IN BAVARIA AND THEY CAME FOR. GATES: PEOPLE WITH A LOT OF MONEY IN THE BANK DON'T MIGRATE. RYAN: YEAH. RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT. GATES: WE HAD ONE MORE SURPRISE FOR PAUL: A SECRET HIDDEN WITHIN HIS OWN DNA. WHEN WE ANALYZED HIS ADMIXTURE, WHICH REFLECTS HIS ANCESTRY OVER ROUGHLY THE LAST 500 YEARS, WE DISCOVERED THAT HIS HERITAGE WAS MORE VARIED THAN THE PAPER TRAIL HAD REVEALED. COULD YOU READ YOUR ADMIXTURE PERCENTAGES? RYAN: OKAY. 61% IRISH/SCOTTISH/WELSH. GATES: WHAT A SHOCK! RYAN: WHAT A SHOCK! 61% IRISH. 15% SCANDINAVIAN, 9% EASTERN EUROPEAN, 3% ASHKENAZI JEWISH, THAT'S REALLY COOL. GATES: THAT IS A LOT. RYAN: IS IT REALLY? GATES: YEAH, THAT MEANS SOMEWHERE, THERE'S A JEWISH GUY THERE. RYAN: THAT'S REALLY COOL. YEAH, THERE'S A JEWISH GUY IN THERE SOMEWHERE. GATES: OR A WOMAN. RYAN: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. RIGHT! VERY COOL. GATES: THREE PERCENTAGE POINTS INDICATES THAT PAUL COULD HAVE A THIRD GREAT-GRANDPARENT OF FULL ASHKENAZI JEWISH DESCENT, THOUGH IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT HE HAS MULTIPLE LINES WITH MORE DISTANT JEWISH ANCESTRY. REGARDLESS, THE DNA EVIDENCE IS UNEQUIVOCAL: PAUL RYAN HAS JEWISH ROOTS. A RESULT THAT HE WELCOMES, AS A REFLECTION OF AMERICA'S GREAT DIVERSITY. RYAN: I THINK OF THE MELTING POT. I THINK OF THE FACT THAT YOU CAN COME FROM ANY BACKGROUND WHATSOEVER AND MAKE IT IN THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE OF FREEDOM, BECAUSE OF OUR SYSTEM, BECAUSE OF PLURALISM. GATES: IT'S WHO WE ARE. IT'S PART OF OUR CULTURAL DNA. RYAN: YEAH. I THINK THAT'S FASCINATING. GATES: YEAH, IT IS. RYAN: IT IS. GATES: WE'D ALREADY INTRODUCED TULSI GABBARD TO HER GREAT-GRANDFATHER BENJAMIN, THE SAILOR WHO CAME TO SAMOA WITH THE U.S. NAVY. NOW, TURNING TO HER MOTHER'S FAMILY TREE, WE CAME UPON ANOTHER MILITARY STORY, FROM A VERY DIFFERENT TIME AND PLACE. TULSI'S THIRD GREAT GRANDFATHER, A MAN NAMED LEWIS PORTER, GREW UP IN PENNSYLVANIA AS THE UNITED STATES MOVED INEXORABLY TOWARDS THE CIVIL WAR. GATES: DID YOU HAVE ANY IDEA? GABBARD: NO. NO. I'VE, I'VE YOU KNOW, LOVED READING ABOUT IT AND LEARNING ABOUT IT AND YOU KNOW, WE'VE GONE THROUGH GETTYSBURG AND YOU KNOW, SEEN SOME OF THE REENACTMENTS BUT I HAVE NEVER IMAGINED THAT MY ANCESTORS WERE THERE FOR THAT. GATES: COULD YOU PLEASE TURN THE PAGE? NOW, YOU KNOW WHERE THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES IS, RIGHT? GABBARD: YES. GATES: THIS IS A PAGE OF A RECORD THAT WE FOUND IN THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES. WOULD YOU MIND READING THE TRANSCRIBED SECTION? GABBARD: STATE OF OHIO, TOWN OF WARREN. I, LEWIS PORTER, BORN IN PENNSYLVANIA, AGE 40 YEARS, VOLUNTEERED THIS 31 DAY OF MARCH 1864 TO SERVE AS A SOLDIER IN THE ARMY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WOW! GATES: YOUR GREAT-GREAT
- GREAT-GRANDFATHER VOLUNTEERED TO FIGHT IN THE UNION ARMY AGAINST THE CONFEDERACY, HOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL? GABBARD: WOW. HONORED. GATES: TULSI'S ANCESTOR NOT ONLY VOLUNTEERED, HE SERVED IN ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CAMPAIGNS OF THE ENTIRE WAR. IN THE SPRING OF 1864, JUST WEEKS AFTER HE'D ENLISTED, LEWIS PORTER'S REGIMENT SET OFF UNDER GENERAL WILLIAM TECUMSEH SHERMAN, ON HIS FAMED ATLANTA CAMPAIGN. WITH LITTLE TRAINING, LEWIS SUDDENLY FOUND HIMSELF MOVING SOUTH, STRAIGHT INTO THE HEART OF THE CONFEDERACY. NOW, YOU'VE SEEN COMBAT, GABBARD: YEAH. GATES: HOW DO YOU THINK LEWIS MUST HAVE FELT? GABBARD: OH, MY GOSH. THIS IS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT LEVEL I MEAN, WHAT THEY, WHAT THEY WENT THROUGH. I ACTUALLY, AS PART OF MY OFFICER CANDIDATE TRAINING, IN ORDER TO EARN MY COMMISSION AS A LIEUTENANT WE WENT AND WALKED THROUGH THOSE BATTLEFIELDS AND HEARD ABOUT YOU KNOW, THE TACTICS AND THE BATTLES THAT WERE FOUGHT THERE. GATES: AND IT NEVER OCCURRED TO YOU THAT ONE OF YOUR ANCESTORS COULD BE THERE. GABBARD: GOSH, NO. GATES: THAT'S AMAZING. THAT IS AMAZING THAT YOU'VE BEEN THERE. GABBARD: IT WAS COOL JUST TO BE THERE AND KIND OF WALK THROUGH THOSE FOOTSTEPS THAT THEY TOOK, BUT UM, NO, I, THE THOUGHT NEVER CROSSED MY MIND. GATES: THE ATLANTA CAMPAIGN WOULD PROVE A SPECTACULAR SUCCESS. BUT IT CAME AT A HEAVY COST. THE UNION WAS OPPOSED BY ONE OF THE LARGEST ARMIES IN THE CONFEDERACY. AND THE TWO FORCES SOON FACED OFF AT A SMALL TOWN IN NORTHERN GEORGIA KNOWN AS RESACA. FOR TWO DAYS, THE UNION STRUGGLED TO DRIVE THE CONFEDERATES FROM THE FIELD, FIGHTING ON TERRAIN THAT WAS ILL-SUITED FOR AN ATTACK. LEWIS'S REGIMENT WAS ON THE FRONT LINES. WE FOUND A NEWSPAPER ARTICLE, WRITTEN JUST WEEKS AFTER THE BATTLE, THAT DESCRIBES WHAT THEY ENDURED. GABBARD: PORTIONS OF PALMER'S CORPS, IN ATTEMPTING TO CHARGE THE REBELS IN FRONT, WERE COMPELLED TO WADE A CREEK WAIST DEEP, WHICH RAN AT THE FOOT OF THE BLUFF; AND THEN ACROSS A VALLEY FILLED WITH DITCHES, FULLY EXPOSED TO A FIRE FROM THE REBEL WORKS. NEVER DID MEN GO TO WORK MORE GALLANTLY, OR CONTEST MORE NOBLY; BUT THEY COULD NOT ACCOMPLISH IMPOSSIBILITIES, AND, AFTER SEVERE LOSS, WERE OBLIGED TO WITHDRAW. GATES: COULD YOU IMAGINE? GABBARD: IT'S TOUGH. GATES: NOW, WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO LEWIS IN THAT BATTLE, BUT HIS REGIMENT WAS ASSAULTING THE VERY SAME CENTER STRETCH OF THE CONFEDERATE LINE DESCRIBED IN THAT ARTICLE. HE AND HIS COMRADES LIKELY DESCENDED A STEEP RIDGE, AND THEN CROSSED A CREEK AND SCALED AN ALMOST VERTICAL SLOPE WHERE THE CONFEDERATES HAD DUG EARTHWORKS, ALL THE WHILE EXPOSED TO DIRECT ENEMY ARTILLERY AND RIFLE FIRE. GABBARD: JEEZ. GATES: SO HE WAS OUT THERE. I MEAN HE WAS EXPOSED. HE WAS ON THE LINE. DO YOU FEEL A SENSE OF PRIDE? FOR YOUR... GABBARD: I DO, I REALLY DO. JUST... GATES: KNOWING THAT THIS GUY EXISTS ON YOUR FAMILY TREE? GABBARD: ABSOLUTELY. YOU KNOW? IT SAYS A LOT ABOUT THIS ETHIC OF SERVICE... GATES: INDEED. GABBARD: GOING BACK MUCH FARTHER THAN I KNEW. GATES: LEWIS PORTER SURVIVED RESACA, BUT SOON FACED AN EVEN GREATER ORDEAL. JUST DAYS AFTER THE BATTLE, HE TOOK ILL, AND WAS SENT TO A FIELD HOSPITAL. HE NEVER FULLY RECOVERED. OVER THE NEXT SIX MONTHS, LOUIS WAS TREATED IN FOUR DIFFERENT HOSPITALS, SUFFERING FROM STOMACH AILMENTS THAT WOULD PERSIST FOR DECADES FOLLOWING THE WAR. ONE OF HIS DOCTOR'S DESCRIBED HIS CONDITION IN SOME DETAIL, AS PART OF LEWIS'S APPLICATION FOR AN INVALID PENSION, FILED IN 1882. GABBARD: I HAVE CAREFULLY EXAMINED LEWIS PORTER, LATE A PRIVATE, CO. A., 105TH REG'T, OHIO INFANTRY WHO IS AN APPLICANT FOR AN INVALID PENSION, THE SAID LEWIS PORTER IS ONE-FOURTH INCAPACITATED. THE DISABILITY IS PROBABLY PERMANENT. LEWIS PORTER STATES THAT HE SUFFERS AND THAT HE IS LABORING UNDER THE DISEASE AT THIS TIME. THIS IS 1882. GATES: HE WAS DISCHARGED FROM THE ARMY ON JULY 22ND, 1865, I MEAN THE POOR GUY IS STILL. GABBARD: SUFFERING STILL. I MEAN THIS UNFORTUNATELY UM, I MEAN THIS REMINDS ME OF WHAT I HEAR FROM VIETNAM VETERANS WHO CALL AND ASK FOR HELP AND WHO SIMILARLY DECADES, DECADES AFTER COMING HOME ARE STILL SUFFERING. GATES: YEAH. GABBARD: YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THE DOLLARS AND CENTS, BUT IT'S NOT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE HUMAN COST AND WHAT OUR COUNTRY PROMISES TO THOSE WHO GO AND SERVE. GATES: WE PROMISE THEM EVERYTHING AND THEN TREAT THEM AS IF THEY'RE AN EMBARRASSMENT TO THE COUNTRY. GABBARD: SADLY. GATES: LEWIS PORTER SUFFERED A GREAT DEAL FOR HIS COUNTRY, BUT HIS STORY HAS A SURPRISINGLY HAPPY ENDING. RECORDS SHOW THAT LEWIS LIVED TO BE 86 YEARS OLD, NOT ONLY THAT, HE MANAGED TO HAVE A FULL LIFE DESPITE HIS ILLNESS, MARRYING THREE TIMES, AND FATHERING AT LEAST 12 CHILDREN. GATES: HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SICK BUT HE WASN'T DEAD. GABBARD: THAT'S RIGHT. GATES: WHAT'S IT BEEN LIKE FOR YOU TO LEARN THIS STORY? GABBARD: IT'S INCREDIBLE AND EXCITING TO HEAR AND IN MY OWN VERY SMALL WAY BE ABLE TO RELATE IN SOME FASHION TO THE CHOICES THAT HE MADE UM, TO VOLUNTEER AND UM, GOSH, WHAT HE WENT THROUGH. GATES: DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU WHEN YOU'RE FIGHTING TO GET YOUR NAME ADDED TO THE DEPLOYMENT LIST THAT BASICALLY YOU'RE CHANNELING YOUR THIRD GREAT-GRANDFATHER. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE CARRYING OUT A TRADITION. GABBARD: NOW I KNOW WHERE I GET IT FROM. GATES: YEAH. THAT'S ASTONISHING, ISN'T IT? GABBARD: THAT'S INCREDIBLE. YEAH. GATES: WE HAD ALREADY TRACED MARCO RUBIO'S FATHER'S FAMILY FROM THE STREETS OF HAVANA TO THE COURTYARDS OF SEVILLE. NOW, TURNING TO HIS MOTHER'S ROOTS, WE EXPECTED TO MAKE A SIMILAR JOURNEY, BUT OUR SEARCH LED US ELSEWHERE. WE STARTED WITH MARCO'S GRANDFATHER, PEDRO GARCIA, A MAN WHOSE LIFE WAS MARKED BY HARDSHIP. RUBIO: MY GRANDFATHER HAD AN UP OR DOWN EXISTENCE. YOU KNOW, HE AT ONE POINT HAD A PRETTY GOOD JOB WORKING IN A, FOR THE RAILROAD COMPANY OR WHATEVER IT WAS AND THEN HE LOST THAT JOB, AND THEN HE STRUGGLED. HE HAD BEEN UH, HANDICAPPED AS A BOY WITH POLIO. AND THERE WERE TIMES WHERE HE REALLY STRUGGLED TO PROVIDE FOR THEM BECAUSE PHYSICALLY HE COULDN'T, YOU KNOW, DO SOME OF THE WORK THAT OTHER PEOPLE COULD DO. GATES: PEDRO IMMIGRATED TO AMERICA FROM CUBA IN THE 1950S. MARCO KNEW HIM, AND REMEMBERS HIM FONDLY AS A MAN WHO LOVED HISTORY AND LOVED STORY-TELLING. BUT PEDRO RARELY SPOKE ABOUT HIS CHILDHOOD, AND MARCO KNOWS NEXT TO NOTHING ABOUT HIS ROOTS. RUBIO: I JUST KNOW HE WAS ONE OF A LOT OF KIDS AND, AND YOU KNOW, THE STORY ALWAYS WAS HIS PARENTS, I'M NOT SURE WERE EVEN MARRIED. GATES: MARCO, THEY HAD 17 CHILDREN. RUBIO: ALL FROM HER? GATES: ALL FROM HER. RUBIO: THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE. GATES: THAT'S HARD WORK. RUBIO: YEAH. GATES: DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE THIS PART OF YOUR FAMILY CAME FROM? RUBIO: I DON'T. WE ARE NOW AT THE LIMITS OF MY KNOWLEDGE OF MY FAMILY'S ANCESTRY, RIGHT HERE. GATES: TO PUSH BEYOND THE LIMITS OF MARCO'S KNOWLEDGE REQUIRED SOME LUCK. WE WERE ABLE TO LEARN VERY LITTLE ABOUT PEDRO'S FATHER CARLOS, AND WE COULD ONLY TRACE HIS MOTHER RAMONA BACK ONE GENERATION, TO THE 1850S. BUT TURNING TO PEDRO'S WIFE, A WOMAN NAMED DOMINGA RODRÍGUEZ Y CHIROLDE, WE WERE ABLE TO GO MUCH FURTHER BACK IN TIME. MANY OF HER ANCESTORS LIVED IN PINAR DEL RÍO, A LARGELY RURAL PROVINCE IN WESTERN CUBA, WHERE WE FOUND A SERIES OF BAPTISM AND MARRIAGE RECORDS TAKING HER ROOTS BACK ALMOST 300 YEARS. MEANING MARCO RUBIO'S FAMILY HAS LIVED IN CUBA FOR MUCH LONGER THAN HE EVER DREAMED. YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE NAME OF YOUR FIFTH GREAT-GRANDFATHER. RUBIO: MANUEL RICARDO DEL ALDANA? GATES: HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF HIM? RUBIO: NO. GATES: HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THAT SURNAME, ALDANA? RUBIO: I'VE HEARD IT, BUT I CAN'T CONNECT IT TO ANYBODY OR ANYTHING. GATES: YOUR FIFTH GREAT
- GRANDFATHER WOULD'VE BEEN BORN AROUND 1730. RUBIO: 1730. GATES: SENATOR, THERE ARE A LOT OF AMERICANS WHOSE ANCESTRY HAILS FROM NORTHERN EUROPE WHO CANNOT GO BACK THIS FAR. RUBIO: GET THIS FAR? YEAH. GATES: IN THEIR FAMILY TREE. RUBIO: YEAH. THAT'S AMAZING, IT REALLY IS. NO ONE CAN SAY I'M NOT CUBAN. GATES: NOBODY. RUBIO: YEAH. GATES: MARCO WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THAT HIS MATERNAL ROOTS RAN SO DEEPLY IN CUBA, HE'D EXPECTED THEM TO TRACE IN THE NEAR PAST BACK TO SPAIN, AS WE'D SEEN ON HIS FATHER'S SIDE. BUT HE WAS EVEN MORE SURPRISED BY WHAT RECORDS REVEALED ABOUT HIS THIRD GREAT-GRANDFATHER, A MAN NAMED JUAN JOSÉ CHIROLES. HE WAS A LANDOWNER. HE OWNED A TOBACCO FARM. DID YOU KNOW THAT? RUBIO: I DID NOT. I HAD NO CLUE. IT'S THE FIRST TIME EVER THAT SOMEONE SAYS THAT ANYBODY IN MY LINEAGE OWNED ANYTHING IN CUBA BEYOND THE CLOTHES ON THEIR BACK. GATES: AS IT TURNS OUT, JUAN OWNED ROUGHLY 30 ACRES OF LAND ON WHICH HE GREW TOBACCO, CORN AND RICE, BUT THAT WASN'T ALL HE OWNED. WE FOUND THE BAPTISMAL RECORD FOR A CHILD BORN TO HIS SLAVE. RUBIO: I, THE PINAR DEL RÍO PARISH PRIEST, SOLEMNLY BAPTIZED ISABEL, BORN ON THE 19TH OF LAST MONTH, DAUGHTER OF THE MOREAN CRIOLLA ANGELA AND AN UNKNOWN FATHER, BOTH SLAVES OF JUAN JOSÉ CHIROLDE, WHO LIVES IN THIS PARISH. WOW. THAT'S WHAT I FEARED WHEN WE WERE GOING INTO THIS WHOLE EXPERIENCE ABOUT THE LAND AND SO FORTH. THAT WAS GONNA BE MY FOLLOW-UP QUESTION, BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW THE ANSWER, SO. GATES: DID YOU EVER IMAGINE THAT YOU HAD A SLAVE OWNER IN YOUR FAMILY TREE? RUBIO: NO, I DIDN'T. I MEAN I DIDN'T THINK THEY OWNED ANY LAND, SO I DIDN'T THINK THEY COULD OWN PEOPLE. GATES: WHAT ARE YOU FEELING? RUBIO: IT'S JUST HARD TO KIND OF PROCESS IT ALL. I MEAN IF YOU BAPTIZED THEM IT'S BECAUSE YOU BELIEVED THEY HAD A SOUL AND WERE CREATED IN GOD'S IMAGE. HOW THEN COULD YOU OWN THEM AS A, AS A PIECE OF CATTLE OR YOU KNOW AND, AND, AND AS A, AS, I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT. GATES: DOES THIS CHANGE THE WAY THAT YOU THINK OF THIS PART OF YOUR FAMILY'S HISTORY? RUBIO: YEAH. I MEAN OBVIOUSLY IT'S JUST NOT SOMETHING I EVER THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT. I JUST DIDN'T THINK IT WAS THERE. YOU SORT OF SEE LIKE ONE GENERATION OWNS LAND AND UM, SADLY OWNS HUMAN BEINGS AND ALL THAT, AND, AND WITHIN TWO GENERATIONS, I MEAN, THEY'RE BARELY FEEDING THEIR KIDS, AND THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES. I MEAN IT JUST TELLS YOU HOW QUICKLY PEOPLE'S FORTUNES CHANGE, RIGHT? GATES: REVERSAL OF FORTUNE. RUBIO: WOW. GATES: THE PAPER TRAIL HAD NOW RUN OUT FOR EACH OF MY GUESTS. IT WAS TIME TO SEE WHAT DNA COULD REVEAL ABOUT THEIR DEEPER ROOTS. WE'D ALREADY SHOWN PAUL RYAN THAT HIS ADMIXTURE REVEALED HIDDEN JEWISH ANCESTRY. FOR TULSI GABBARD, THE SAME TEST REFLECTED THE ENORMOUS DIVERSITY WE'D SEEN IN HER GENEALOGY, TYING HER TO ETHNIC GROUPS ACROSS THE GLOBE, FROM NORTHERN EUROPE, TO SOUTHEAST ASIA! GABBARD: GOSH. THIS JUST SHOWS HOW CONNECTED WE ALL ARE. GATES: INDEED. GABBARD: THIS IS FURTHER PROOF AND EVIDENCE. WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR LIVES AND THOSE WHO'VE COME BEFORE US WE'RE ALL CONNECTED. GATES: WE'RE ALL CONNECTED. TURNING TO MARCO RUBIO, WE HAD ONE FINAL REVELATION TO SHARE. WHEN WE ANALYZED HIS MITOCHONDRIAL DNA, A GENETIC FINGERPRINT PASSED DOWN UNCHANGED FROM MOTHER TO CHILD FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS, WE FOUND THAT HIS DIRECT MATERNAL LINE WAS NATIVE AMERICAN. ONE OF YOUR GREAT-GREAT
- GREAT-GRANDMOTHERS WAS A PURE NATIVE AMERICAN. RUBIO: YEAH, WOW, LOOK AT THAT. GATES: SCHOLARS BELIEVE THAT THE NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATION IN PINAR DEL RÍO MIGRATED FROM THE YUCATÁN PENINSULA ABOUT 4000 BC. RUBIO: RIGHT. GATES: SO, TALK ABOUT, YOU KNOW, ANCESTRAL ROOTS IN CUBA, YOUR FAMILY ON YOUR NATIVE AMERICAN LINE'S BEEN THERE FOR A LONG, LONG TIME. RUBIO: RIGHT. I'VE BEEN TO THOSE RUINS IN THE YUCATÁN. GATES: OH YEAH? RUBIO: AT CHICHEN ITZA, AND WHO KNEW I WAS GOING BACK HOME? GATES: MARCO'S DNA UNDERSCORES A LARGER POINT: ALMOST EVERY AMERICAN DESCENDS FROM SOMEONE WHO WASN'T BORN IN OUR COUNTRY, BUT HAS EMBRACED, AND ENRICHED IT JUST THE SAME. WE'D SEEN THIS OVER AND OVER IN MY GUESTS' FAMILY TREES, AND ITS RELEVANCE WASN'T LOST ON ANY OF THEM, LEAST OF ALL ON MARCO RUBIO. RUBIO: THIS REALLY BRINGS IT TO LIGHT ABOUT AMERICA. IN AMERICA WE DON'T HAVE A COMMON ETHNICITY, A COMMON LANGUAGE. I MEAN THERE'S, THERE ARE COUNTRIES IN THIS WORLD THAT DOING THE DNA OF THE POPULATION WOULD NOT BE VERY COMPLICATED, EVERYONE AT SOME POINT IS PRETTY SIMILAR. GATES: LIKE ICELAND. RUBIO: LIKE, YEAH, RIGHT. SO, I, AND OTHER PLACES. AND, BUT IN AMERICA WE'RE, IT'S NOT JUST A GENETIC MIX. WE COME FROM DIFFERENT CONTINENTS AND DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD. IF YOU GO FAR ENOUGH, WE COME FROM EVERYWHERE. BUT I'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT THE ONE THING WE HAVE IN COMMON IN ALL OF OUR DNA AS AMERICANS IS WE ALL DESCEND FROM GO-GETTERS. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US DESCENDS FROM SOMEONE WHO OVERCAME INCREDIBLE ADVERSITY, WHETHER IT WAS UH, THE JOURNEY THAT BROUGHT THEM INTO, INTO SLAVERY AND THEN SURVIVED IT IN BRUTAL CONDITIONS FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS, WHETHER IT'S SOMEONE WHO CAME LAST WEEK FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY IN SEARCH OF A BETTER LIFE, OR SOMEONE WHO CAME 200 YEARS AGO IN SEARCH OF A BETTER LIFE. OUR COMMON DNA IN AMERICA IS WE ALMOST ALL DESCEND FROM A GO-GETTER, SOMEONE WHO REFUSED TO ACCEPT THE LIMITS PUT UPON THEM IN THE OLD WORLD, AND SO THEY REACHED FOR THIS ONE PLACE WHERE THEY WERE GONNA BE JUDGED BY WHO THEY WERE, NOT WHERE THEY CAME FROM. GATES: THAT'S THE END OF OUR JOURNEY WITH MARCO, TULSI, AND PAUL. JOIN ME NEXT TIME WHEN WE UNLOCK THE SECRETS OF THE PAST FOR NEW GUESTS ON ANOTHER EPISODE OF FINDING YOUR ROOTS.

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] Woman: Jason Morgan? You're Jason Morgan, right? Hi, I'm Harmony. Welcome to Beechers Corners. Thank you. Is this your first visit? No. Oh. Well, since you called with questions about Dawn of Day, I suspect you want to know what's up with us, right? Check us out? So, let's get to it. Thank you for meeting me. Yeah, of course. Thanks for the...invite. [ Sighs ] Although I think I know why you invited me here. Yes. Jason told me about the breakup, and I just wanted to offer my support to both of you. Which means you want to talk me out of breaking up with him. [ Laughs ] -Hey. -Hey. Sorry to interrupt. I just wanted to say hi. Drew. Hi. Hi. Hi, yourself. Josslyn told me the good news about Oscar... What? What? There's good news about Oscar? Yeah, uh, the -
- the -
- the tumor hasn't grown, so it buys him more time. What? That is -
- That's incredible. Anyway, uh, his mom and I, we're trying to get back to normal life. [ Chuckles ] Whatever that is. So, I finally have time to check in on Hank or Shiloh -
- Shi-S-Shiloh. No, don't -
- don't even worry about it. I got -
- Well, hold on. If -
- If Drew has the time... I mean, the more information, the better, right? Exactly. And I want to help, so... He made a point to be friendly, so the least I could do is be friendly back. -Hey. I-It was -
- -Yeah. It was good to see you, and -
- and I'm -
- I'm really happy to hear about Oscar. Yeah. Me, too. Thanks. Hey. Let's hope we get lucky and Drew gets leverage on Shiloh, and then you and Jason won't have to break up after all. You're Dr. Neil Byrne. And you're Alexis Davis. Yep. Says it right here. Dr. Neil Byrne. Psychiatrist. Gee, I wish I had read this before I pocketed it.

- the flower bed down there. She'd like that... If you have postmenopausal osteoporosis and a high risk for fracture now might not be the best time to ask yourself are my bones strong? Life is full of make-or-break moments. That's why it's so important to help reduce your risk of fracture with Prolia®. Only Prolia® is proven to help strengthen and protect bones from fracture with 1 shot every 6 months. Do not take Prolia® if you have low blood calcium, are pregnant, are allergic to it, or take XGEVA®. Serious allergic reactions, like low blood pressure; trouble breathing; throat tightness; face, lip, or tongue swelling; rash; itching; or hives have happened. Tell your doctor about dental problems as severe jaw bone problems may happen or new or unusual pain in your hip groin, or thigh, as unusual thigh bone fractures have occurred. Speak to your doctor before stopping Prolia® as spine and other bone fractures have occurred. Prolia® can cause serious side effects, like low blood calcium, serious infections, which could need hospitalization, skin problems, and severe bone, joint, or muscle pain. Are you ready? Ask your doctor how Prolia® can help strengthen your bones. In our family we love tiny things. We save every drop of rain, study every bite of frost.

It's a very thoughtful gesture... I didn't see you there -
- [ Door opens ] Griffin? Come away from there, would you? You're -
- You're too close to the edge. You have some kind of death wish? Wouldn't want you to lose your balance. What brings you here? Looking for Griffin? No, I'm looking for you. I know what you've been up to. We can do whatever you feel is best... Uh, I'm happy to give you a referral. Well, I can't very well go back to Dr. Collins because I'm representing his wife in his divorce... And there, I did it again. I offered way too much information. You're talking to a therapist. There's no such thing. But I-I can tell you're uncomfortable. So, I am going to give you the name of an associate who may... [ Paper tears ] ...be a good fit. And -
- And I hope it works out between you and Dr. Sautner. Thank you. Uh, good night. [ Sighs ] [ Sighing ] Oh, God. That's a nice surprise. Well, you know, I had a free night. I thought maybe we could, uh, reconnect... That's great, man. Thanks, uh -
- Thanks for calling. After you. -Thank you. -Mm-hmm. -[ Sighs ] You know, I, uh... [ Door closes ] ...really wanted to, uh, you know, talk about our time in Afghanistan together. I guess that's back when you went by Hank, right? [ Chuckles ] Well, it's, uh... it's true. You, uh -
- You saved my life. But, uh -
- But it was more than that, man. We, uh -
- We were seriously tight. Although, you, uh -
- you held your cards a little closer to the vest than I did. You sure as hell held your liquor better. There was, uh, no drunken, sloppy, late-night confessions from you. Take it there were from you? Well, you know, just things that I had to get off my chest. In case I didn't make it back that day, you know? Yeah, well, that's understandable. [ Chuckles ] I mean, you always said that you didn't remember, but, uh... I think you were doing that just to make me feel better. Must have been... some confessions. How are Danny and Scout? Scout -
- she is gonna be two... Oh, my gosh. ...in like two weeks. [ Laughs ] And Danny, he's just the sweetest, most thoughtful little boy in the whole entire world. Mm. I actually told him I was coming here to see you and Sonny, and -
- I'm sorry, I don't have a purse, it's in my pocket -
- but he, um, wanted me to give you this. Oh! [ Laughs ] Isn't it cute? Oh, my goodness. It's so adorable. [ Gasps ] Wow. Little boys can surprise you, can't they? Um... I mean, I would never associate Danny with crafts and cards. I mean, that boy, he's such a little adventure guy. [ Chuckling ] Oh, tell me about it. He's, like, running and jumping and everything. I know. I know. I just had to have Monica lock the attic because he was bringing Annabelle the Second up to the attic and they were playing on the roof. Who does that sound like, huh? Just like his father. I mean, just fearless enough to where you want to rip your hair out, but... just sweet and thoughtful all at the same time. You're gonna have to work a little harder to hide how much you love Jason if you want to sell this whole breakup thing. But before I answer <i> your</i> questions, do you mind answering one of<i> mine?</i> Uh, depends on the question. You're here on someone's behalf. Who? A family member? I consider her one, yes. In Beechers Corners? Is it someone I know? No. Well, then, why come here? Why not just talk to Shiloh? He's in Port Charles. Because I wanted to talk to someone besides... Hank Archer. [ Laughs ] Now that's a blast from the past. [ Chuckles ] I used to be called Lorraine. Yeah, me, a Lorraine. My parents chose it, obviously, but it was never a good fit. I found it so freeing and empowering to be able to choose my own name. So, you became Harmony. Like Hank became Shiloh. Well, choosing my own name was a-a bridge to becoming my true self. Shiloh. [ Chuckles ] He untethered me from what was holding me back, and Dawn of Day opened my mind and my heart to my own potential. Did you notice that community center across the street? Shiloh and I built it from the ground up. Are you still in touch with, uh -
- with Shiloh? Yeah, well...of course. We still conduct business together, if that's what you mean. But you're not together. I mean, you're here. Shiloh's in Port Charles. Why? MOVING?

What is it you think I'm up to? Oh, come on, Kevin. It's why you're up here, isn't it? I went to your office, looking for you. I found this on your desk. You've arranged for a commemorative brick in Kiki's honor. The letter says that the best way to choose a spot is to look down from the roof, so I-I came up here to see for myself, give you my input... It's a lovely gesture, Kevin. Thank you. It's all I could think of. Just have something of Kiki here at the hospital, and maybe bring some small comfort to the people who miss her. I was just saying the same thing. Let me know when, uh, you guys pick the final spot. I'm sorry. I, uh... I have somewhere I need to be. Now Kiki will be a part of the place that she loved forever. I admit, a brick isn't much, but if it dissipates your anger towards me, then I'm doubly glad I thought of it. I'm not angry, Kevin. I jumped to conclusions. I owe you an apology. See, in order to find out more about Shiloh, I have to make myself seem really vulnerable. Okay, but this guy obviously has charisma, and he knows how to use it... Do you think he's a sexual predator? Well, I intend to find out. Not only for Kristina's sake, but every other girl that's living under that roof. That's why I have to see this through. Okay. But to do that, you have to con him, right? Do you think you can? Trust me. Shiloh's about to get a taste of his own medicine. I was one of Shiloh's earliest supporters. He was the visionary, and I was the pragmatist to help make it work. So, why are you guys apart? That's simple -
- he wants to expand the work that we do. Okay, so why Port Charles? Well, the city suffered a bad earthquake a while back, and Shiloh found people in Port Charles who needed the kind of outreach that Dawn of Day could provide. So, he left, and I stayed behind to continue the work that we do here. Yeah, he seems, uh, pretty devoted to his work. What about a life outside of it? Shiloh's life is his work. Oh, so no -
- no family? No -
- No interest in -
- in having a family? [ Chuckles ] Dawn of Day is a family. Why do you ask? Well, because [sighs] the young lady I'm here for, I mean, she's really involved with Dawn of Day, but she's -
- you know, she's a little naive, and she's growing attached to Shiloh as more than a mentor. I'm s-
- What are you implying? She's falling for him. So, h-how does he -
- how does he handle situations like this when they come up? Yeah, well, that's the, uh -
- the thing about confessions. When you're in the middle of making them, they seem of monumental importance. But, uh, when you're looking at them in the grand scheme of life, well, they're not important at all, are they? I guess you got a point, but, uh, you know, why are you still thinking about them? I don't know. I mean, I guess coming back to Port Charles, it just, you know, brought it all back, you know? First, I run into a brother that I didn't even know you have with<i> your</i> face. Yeah. Right? And then I-I see you again with -
- with -
- with a-another face, and -
- and you don't know me from Adam, you know, so... Well, I don't remember anyone or anything, so, uh, don't take it personally. Not at all. So, is there any chance your memories will return? -We're doing karaoke later, and you're gonna sing. -Jamie, this is your house? -I know, it's not much, but it's home. Right, kids? -Kids? -Papa, Papa! -[ Laughs ] -You didn't tell me your friends were coming. -Oh, yeah. -This one is tiny like a child. -Yeah, she is. Oh, but seriously, it's good to be surrounded by what matters most -
- a home and auto bundle from Progressive. -Oh, sweetie, please, play for us. -Oh, no, I couldn't. -Please. -Okay.

I'm sick and tired of everybody talking to me about Kiki. Talking isn't gonna bring her back. [Music] Don't get lost and lose the here [Music] Once I calmed down, I realized -
- that you weren't protecting Franco. You didn't notify the police because you knew he wasn't a threat, and if you thought he was, you definitely would've warned us. I never believed Franco would harm anyone. Especially not your beautiful daughter... Even with his dark side, I never thought he would act on those impulses. I know. I spoke with him. I'm convinced he's innocent. That means the killer is still free. That<i> is</i> a real problem. Doesn't have to be. You need to go to the police, Kevin. You need to tell them that they have the wrong man. [ Knock on door ] Come in. You know, I've thought about it, and I thought, You know what? I've already spilled my guts to you. And -
- And since I'm perfectly at ease talking to a complete stranger, which I have no explanation for, it makes sense that I would be comfortable speaking to you here. So, if you're still willing to treat me... I am. And based on our previous discussion, you have some intriguing issues to work out. Uh...referring back to our conversation, I-I just have to ask, just to be sure... When we met at Charlie's, did you know that I was your patient? So, supposedly, there's a procedure that could, um [inhales deeply] possibly undo what had been done to me. Well, forgive me, I-I-I don't know what happened to you. Long story. Heard plenty of long stories, brother. [ Laughs ] Yeah, not like this, I can assure you. You know how, um... you said you were surprised to hear that I went AWOL? Yeah. Well, that wasn't the case. I was abducted. I knew it. I knew it. I knew you would never abandon your post. That's what happened to you... Well, the plan was to, uh... put me in my brother's place to, uh... transfer his knowledge, his memories into my head, and then he could be eliminated. Yeah, but he's still around, so... someone messed up. First part worked. I got his memories, and, uh, well, I lost my own. Now, you said that there was some procedure that could help you recover your memories. Now, why -
- why -
- why wouldn't you do that? What -
- What could be holding you back? Maybe Sonny could<i> persuade</i> Shiloh to leave town? No, no, no, no, no. No, that could backfire. Shiloh could tell Kristina. Kristina -
- she could dig in so much harder. No way. All right. Oh, I hate this. I hate this for everyone. You and Jason just got back together. I'd like to wring Shiloh's enlightened neck. I've got to pretend to hang on to his every word. God. Yeah. What if he catches on that you're playing him? Well, I've -
- I-I-I have thought about this, and I've got a few things going for me. One: I am an experienced con. Two: Shiloh expects women to fall for him, including Kristina. I mean, and all these other girls, they're almost like his groupies, and he assumes he can pull me in. All I have to do is play along. Shiloh is naturally warm and inclusive, and that can be misunderstood by some of our more... vulnerable volunteers. So, what does Shiloh do about that? He handles it. He handles it? I-I mean, like I said, my friend's vulnerable and -
- and naive. I just -
- I don't -
- I don't want her to get hurt, so, I mean, what d-
- how does he handle -
- Cop Billy: Jason Morgan? Yeah. Um... is there -
- is there a problem? Ran your plates. Seems you have an arrest record here in Beechers Corners. For murder. Yeah, those -
- those charges were dropped.

Stand up to Chronic Migraine with BOTOX®. What if you had fewer headaches and migraines a month? BOTOX® prevents headaches and migraines before they even start. BOTOX® is for adults with Chronic Migraine, 15 or more headache days a month, each lasting 4 hours or more. BOTOX® injections take about 15 mins. in your doctor's office and are covered by most insurance. Effects of BOTOX® may spread hours to weeks after injection causing serious symptoms. Alert your doctor right away, as difficulty swallowing, speaking, breathing, eye problems, or muscle weakness can be signs of a life-threatening condition. Side effects may include allergic reactions, neck and injection site pain, fatigue, and headache. Don't receive BOTOX® if there's a skin infection.

At which time, I was already sitting down at Charlie's with my book and my coffee. So, no -
- I didn't know that the interesting woman sitting down next to me -
- and who I asked to dinner -
- was Alexis Davis, my soon-to-be patient. And if I did, I would never have asked you to dinner. I apologize for questioning your professionalism. Apology accepted. But, you know, if we move forward... can you trust me? Now, see, there's a lot to unpack in that question. Hmm. I can try. Well, why don't we, um, see how today goes, and if you choose to, we can continue? Okay. You were, uh, prompted to call me this afternoon, and I'm just wondering why it was so urgent to return to therapy at this point. Oh, well, there are a lot of reasons. Chief among them i-is the feeling I had when I saw my ex-husband kissing his girlfriend, his new girlfriend. And then there was yesterday, I had this experience at this organization called Dawn of Day. So, as I understand it, uh... the procedure is a lot like overwriting a computer program. Yeah. My old memories will be restored -
- but all the memories I've made in the past five years would essentially be eliminated, deleted. You know... The relationships I've made, people I've grown to love, memories of my daughter, Scout. From the day she was born up until now, gone. Hmm. I didn't even know I had a son until I moved to Port Charles, so meeting him, the memories we've made together... I'd lose them. They mean everything to me. So... The short answer is no. I will not be having the procedure. That's good. That's good, man. You got your priorities straight. [ Chuckles ] You know the worst part of this whole thing is having to lie to Danny. I know, he's just too young to understand everything that's going on, and I know he's gonna be missing out on some major family time. Can't you guys meet up at the Quartermaines? Well, yeah, I'm -
- I'm counting on it. Monica's been pretty great about that. She's the ultimate hands-off mother-in-law. Monica? Yeah. A-Are you serious? Yeah. Oh, my gosh, when I was married to A.J., all she did was meddle. I mean, I guess I understand, because A.J. and I loathed each other, but... Anyway, I'm just saying, you guys have a totally different relationship than I had. You know, it's -
- it's really funny. For two people that can't stand each other, you two are a lot alike... In what universe? You both have a love for family. Well, you're a part of that club, too, Sam. I mean, look at everything you're doing to protect Kristina. Yeah, but I also know what it's like to have a guy use you and make you feel worthless and tear down your self-esteem. And I am not gonna let Shiloh do that to Kristina. Officer, I've done nothing wrong. I'm just trying to sit here and have a conversation... Could there be some kind of mistake? No mistake. Mr. Morgan's vehicle is parked too close to a designated handicapped spot. Th-There was no -
- There was no sign. They're difficult to see, even in the daylight. I need you to move it now, or I'll have it impounded. It's okay, Billy. Billy. Mr. Morgan will move his car shortly. Okay? We're just wrapping things up here. But thank you for your diligence. [ Sighs ] Sure thing, Harmony. Okay. I'm sorry. His bark is worse than his bite. Yeah, well, thank you for smoothing that over. Yeah. It's wonderful how this community looks out for each other. It's really come together since Dawn of Day launched here. I hope we can bring that same sort of fellowship to Port Charles. Is there anything else you'd like to know? I think I've heard enough. I hope I've calmed your anxieties on behalf of your...person. Do you feel more comfortable about Dawn of Day now? I've learned a lot. Look, I-I-I'm sorry. Really, I-I-I don't know what came over me. It's just... Look, I don't know what's worse -
- thinking about Kiki, or -
- or -
- or not thinking about her. I-I'm consumed with missing her. I-I can't seem to find a moment's peace. So, how did you get those bruises? I noticed them when I came in. Did you get mugged or something? Uh...boxing. I-I spar sometimes. With those neurosurgeon hands? Are you crazy? No, we, uh -
- we wear gloves. You know, big -
- big, padded ones. Okay, well, pick someone your own size next time. [ Chuckles ] Looks like you were boxing a kangaroo. No, I just, uh... I just lost focus, that's all. I... My mind wanders, and, uh, regret just takes over. I know the feeling. What do you have to regret? It's important that the police stop wasting their time on Franco -
- and -
- and find the monster who killed Kiki. I know you're struggling with terrible grief, and I didn't want to add to it by upsetting you... You didn't. It's -
- It isn't your fault that I overreacted. But you ran right back to Griffin. [ Chuckles ] What? Oh, you saw Griffin comforting me and you assumed that I went<i> back</i> to him? Ava, you ran out on me. And you're so beautiful, and... Come on. Let's face it -
- the man's an Adonis, and... Naturally, I just thought that -
- You -
- You're insane. You know that? And I'd have to be equally insane to go back to the man who betrayed me with my own daughter. Kevin... [ Chuckling ] Oh, Kevin. The Russells travel to a different swim meet every Saturday. But now... it's Thursday. Good thing they discovered Gain Flings.

When I found out I had Age-related Macular Degeneration, AMD, I wanted to fight back. My doctor and I came up with a plan.

Thanks Mr. Lee! Now there's no such thing as too close. Yes, there is. No, there's not. Yes there is. No, there's not! Okay. <i> All-New Colgate Total.</i> <i> Do more for your whole mouth.</i> [ Sighs ] I-I came to Port Charles with zero expectations. I was gonna blow in, meet my biological mother, and blow out. And then I met Nina, and Kiki, and Charlotte, and all these people that I came to care about. And I found myself worrying about you all, hoping that you were all okay. That's good. [ Chuckles ] That's -
- That's a good thing. You made -
- You made connections. I just want to do the right thing, but I'm not sure how. There are things that are [exhales sharply] hard to fix. You want to talk about it? I'm, uh -
- I'm open, wide-open to distractions, um... And I-I really want to help. Thanks. [ Chuckles ] Why is it so hot in here? It's the building. You can't -
- You can't control the radiator. Kiki showed me a few tricks, but I never really got the hang of it. You know, she had the -
- the magic touch... ...with everything she did. [ Sighs ] Are you okay? I really thought I had lost you. [ Exhales sharply ] You know... it's only been a short time, Ava, but... you have my heart. [ Chuckles ] You're everything to me. I don't think I'd be able to go on putting one foot in front of the other if I -
- if I'd lost the woman I love. You... You love me? In an effort to try to heal this rift between my daughter and me, I agreed to attend a seminar led by this man that she respects. And how was it? Weird. Completely uncomfortable, but I played nicely in order to appease my daughter, and in that, I ended up admitting that I have this yearning to have the same feeling that I had when I was with my ex. And as you astutely put it, y-you said that I tend to frame everything in -
- in the context of my ex, and I-I-I don't want to do that anymore. Um... I'm, uh, fairly certain that I don't want a relationship with him again. However, his type, that type is the type that I am, uh, drawn to. So, you have a type? Oh, I do. I do, yes. Um... Um, Dangerous. Selfish. Incapable of intimacy and honesty, and... someone who loves power more than they will ever love me. Is there a man in your life who, uh, set this pattern up for you? My father. You know, it's a small world, because he's one of those exiled Russian aristocrats that you're so fond of studying. Hmm. Shiloh: That is a lot of pain that you're carrying around, man. And if you ever just want to reconcile what happened to you or -
- or just vent... my seminars have helped ease a lot of suffering. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Including your own? Well, they're a result of my own breakthroughs, you know? Hmm. I've learned to untie from my troubled past. And now that I know that it's no longer burdening you, either, well, looks like we both could have a little closure. Tell you what. No charge. [ Chuckles ] Hell, maybe I should start my own seminars. Looks like you've given me my life back yet again. Thank you. Okay. All right. Thanks for coming by, man. It was good seeing you. Thanks for having me. Anytime. I'd invite you to attend an open house here or in Port Charles, but something tells me that'll never happen. You know, I really wish you'd open your mind and accept help. You must bear scars being arrested for a murder that you didn't commit. No. I don't. Thank you for your time. Okay, I-I know that you and Jason aren't candy-hearts-and-flowers kind of people, but you should be together on Valentine's Day. I have plans on Valentine's Day. You're going to that event at Dawn of Day, aren't you? I've seen the fliers -
- True Love Begins with Self Love. [ Laughs ] [ Laughs ] Shiloh's expecting me. Ugh, well, you can have an emergency. You know, a tire could blow, anything. Oh, God. No, no, no, no. That is very tempting. Don't do that. I will not be spending Valentine's Day with the man that I love. I will be at the Dawn of Day house, soaking up all of Shiloh's... wisdom with an eager smile on my face. Because the harder I sell this... the faster I can get Kristina out of there.

With Neulasta Onpro patients get their day back... to be with family, or just to sleep in. Strong chemo can put you at risk of serious infection. In a key study Neulasta reduced the risk of infection from 17% to 1%, a 94% decrease. Neulasta Onpro is designed to deliver Neulasta the day after chemo and is used by most patients today. Neulasta is for certain cancer patients receiving strong chemotherapy. Do not take Neulasta if you're allergic to it or Neupogen (filgrastim). An incomplete dose could increase infection risk. Ruptured spleen, sometimes fatal as well as serious lung problems, allergic reactions, kidney injuries and capillary leak syndrome have occurred. Report abdominal or shoulder tip pain, trouble breathing or allergic reactions to your doctor right away. In patients with sickle cell disorders, serious, sometimes fatal crises can occur. The most common side effect is bone and muscle ache. Ask your doctor about Neulasta Onpro. Pay no more than $5 per dose with copay card. So, if it's okay with you, I think maybe we could skip over the gory details of my family, because if we go through all the twists and turns, we're gonna be here all year, right? So, if I can just sum it all up by saying that my father was... distant, unapproachable, and a controlling figure in my life. He was, um...ruthless, and powerful, and I was simultaneously drawn to him and repelled by him. I rarely got his attention, and I never earned his love... Which would explain why I've had a string of hideous relationships with ruthless and unattainable men. You mentioned earning your father's love. Yeah, that's not your job to earn your father's love. Parental love is a gift -
- no strings attached. Then you don't know <i> my</i> family, because in my family, love is not a gift. It's a weakness to be exploited. And at what age did you realize that? Oh. Well, I have no idea, because I've blocked out most of my childhood. Did I mention that my stepmother murdered my mother -
- and I witnessed it? Um, you probably have suffered some, uh, post-traumatic stress. Have you ever been diagnosed or treated? No. So, uh, where does your father fit in here? Well, he was the only one that would -
- <i> could</i> check my stepmother, because he was as ruthless and cruel as she was. So perhaps you equate cruelty and ruthlessness to safety. Only powerful men -
- as selfish and unattainable as they are -
- assure you your survival. You know, I-I never really thought about it like that. Well... [ Notebook thuds ] ...if we decide to move forward, we can help you lead yourself to a better understanding of yourself. Start guiding you away from the people that are not good for you or to you, and maybe lead you to healthier relationships. I think I'd like that. So, another appointment? Yeah. I was hoping to save those words for Valentine's Day. Don't. Please. I won't. I love you. I love you, too. I love you very much. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring up Kiki again for you... I really should be heading out... Uh, thank you for stopping by. If I come back, I'll bring ice packs. [ Chuckles ] You're welcome to stop by anytime. Just, um... do me a favor -
- work on those regrets. You're just too young to have that weighing on you. So are you. Harmony. To what do I owe the pleasure? You sound upbeat. Well, it is a beautiful night. And I have just discovered that a potential threat isn't so threatening at all. Well, I thought you should know... I just met with a Jason Morgan. He was questioning me about you. Yeah, yeah, I expected that. What's the upshot? I arranged for an assist from our favorite cop Billy. Oh, wonderful. Well, I hope he made Jason feel less than welcome. No, Billy did his part. Jason didn't seem to be intimidated, but I doubt he'll be back in Beechers Corners. He didn't learn anything we didn't want him to know. That's good. Hey! You just missed Sam. Or was that intentional? Uh, one of your -
- one of your bartenders is into Dawn of Day. What? Which one? No idea -
- Sonny was talking to him. Damn it. I mean, I can't fire him. But I also don't want him here lurking around, reporting everything back to Shiloh. I really wanted this to be a safe place for you and Sam. It's okay, Carly. We'll f-
- We'll find a safe place. [ Sighs ] I can't tell you how unsettling it is that this Shiloh guy was able to make inroads for a long time and no one noticed. [ Sighs ] Do you know that Dawn of Day was behind the clothing drive that the kids were a part of last fall? Mm-hmm. Had I known that, I would have never let Josslyn participate! Okay, okay, Josslyn is not vulnerable. She has a great sense of herself... Okay, it's Kristina. She's the one who's in deep. Really? Okay, do you think Sam's gonna be able to pull her out? I don't know. It might -
- It might help if Shiloh's distracted. You know, feeling a little pressure from the outside. What kind of pressure? I'm not sure. I took a trip up to Beechers Corners to check out the original Dawn of Day, and it did give me a good idea of how it works. But now... I got to figure out how to take it down. into each dish. That's what my food is about-
- flavor, love. Whew! Do-or-die time. I'm ready. I've been ready. I need everybody to kind of start setting up their stations, okay? ARIEL: You guys should be doing last-minute things right now.

Super hot, super hot. <i> [Music] [Music]</i> -It's done. -Go, go, go. Amazing process to watch. -Scary. -Very scary. Guys, listen up, first entrées-
- we're gonna go on two rib cap, two wagyu. -How long? -I need eight minutes, Chef. Eight minutes, two rib cap, two wagyu heard. <i> I've never worked</i> <i> with Scotley before,</i> so I'm gonna keep an eye on him tonight, and the menu's a little lighter tonight, so hopefully Scotley can keep up. -Oh, my God. Scotley. -Right now, Chef. -Scotley, watch your grill. SCOTLEY: Heard. We're charring on our steaks over here. SCOTLEY: Heard. ARIEL: We want perfect food tonight, okay? It's not a race. It always get annoying when, you know, <i> you have a backseat driver.</i> <i> Somebody over your shoulder</i> <i> telling you how to cook.</i> Man, I got this. I been doing this. We got to watch the grill because we're getting too much char. I would like to start a couple new ones. SCOTLEY: Yes, Chef. <i> ARIEL: Come on, man.</i> I'm not concerned about rushing these out. I want to make sure we get them to the guests the way they're intended to be enjoyed. All right, I need to see those rib cap. Bring them up. SCOTLEY: Bringing it right now, Chef. <i> [Music] [Music]</i> That's perfectly cooked. -Not more than this. -Heard, Chef. Trust me. I'm here to help you. ARIEL: I need service, please. Our chef seems very self-assured. -Yeah. -All right, guys, next ticket. You said three minutes. You should be 30 seconds out. Let's go. Okay, so away now, two chicken, two churrasco. ALL: Heard. HEATHER: Two chicken, two beef, heard, Chef. JOSE: Two chicken, two churrasco. MIA: Guys, I need five minutes on that next check, the two skirt and the two chicken. <i> MIA: I'm a little nervous</i> <i> about Heather.</i> She just lost to me, so it may be a little difficult to motivate her. Nice sear, nice glaze, medium-rare. <i> I just hope</i> <i> that she can support me.</i> How long--two chicken, two churrasco? Give me three minutes on the two beef and two chicken, yeah? I'm all about carrying Mia to victory, whether we're BFFs or not. Chicken and beef are up. Let me know when you're ready to walk. You ready to go, Jose? Let me go first, yeah, two chicken. I'm coming up. Proteins walking. Behind, Chef, hot. Are they rested? Yes, Chef. Hopefully I lead Mia into victory <i> 'cause I know what it's like</i> <i> to have my hand on that door</i> <i> and it not open.</i> <i> It hurts.</i> <i> [Music] [Music]</i> -Heather, beautiful cook... -Yes? -On the protein. -Thank you. -Keep it coming, okay? -Thank you. <i> NARRATOR: With entrées</i> <i> leaving Mia's kitchen</i> <i> at a steady pace...</i> GORDON: Keep it going, Mia. Keep it going. -This is juicy and soft. -Yeah. <i> NARRATOR: Over in the red</i> <i> kitchen, veteran Ariel...</i> Guys, next ticket, how long chicken, wagyu? <i> NARRATOR: Is continuing</i> <i> to push Bret for perfection.</i> Walking as soon as garnish is up, Chef. ARIEL: Thank you. <i> Bret has a big responsibility.</i> <i> He only has to cook</i> <i> two proteins tonight,</i> so I need to make sure that he nurses and babysits that wagyu so that it's absolutely perfect. Oh, boy. <i> BRET: I wish I was</i> <i> in the finale right now,</i> <i> considering I was so close,</i> <i> but Ariel--</i> <i> she's a phenomenal chef,</i> <i> and she deserves this win bad,</i> and I'm gonna do whatever I can to [bleep] help her get it. Chef, behind, chicken, wagyu. He told me he walked up chicken garnish followed by steak garnish. GORDON: [bleep] hell. Really? It's cold. We're serving cold [bleep] food. I need a little heat on this. -Be very careful. GORDON: Just touch it. -I don't want it overcooked. BRET: Heard, Chef. I know it's a wagyu, I get that, -but it's barely lukewarm. -Yes, Chef. Timing's way off. <i> BRET: I feel bad whenever</i> <i> I [bleep] up a food</i> or it's not 100% flawless the first time whether it's for Ariel, Chef, any customer, my clients, whatever. <i> I bring passion every time</i> <i> I step in that kitchen.</i> BRET: Chef, right behind to your left. -ARIEL: Thank you. -Get this on the plate. It's got to send. Service, please. Let's go, let's go. -Three pork, one churrasco. -We got a minute and a half. <i> NARRATOR: After a few hiccups</i> <i> from both teams...</i> Pick up two mackerel, two wagyu, how long? -Right now, Chef. MOTTO: Right now. <i> NARRATOR:</i> <i> The Hell's Kitchen rookie...</i> -Rested? -Yes, Chef. <i> NARRATOR: And the</i> <i> Hell's Kitchen veteran...</i> -Let's go.

MIA: Perfect. I'm not sharing this with you. -This is too good. MARSHA: Wow, that's great! That is really good, you know? They did a good job. Oh. Away now--two sea bass, two churrasco. JOSE: Two sea bass-
- -I want it perfect, Roe, okay? ROE: Yes, ma'am. -How long? -Five minutes, five minutes. -Five. -You need five? That's fine. -Yeah. Five. Guys, this is the last stretch, okay? -Let's finish strong. -Push it up. 'Cause I want you guys to nail it. We have a really good pace going, and it feels good, but I'm not celebrating just yet. Two sea bass, two churrasco, how long? You ready? I can go. Do you need a minute? ROE: I think I'm good. HEATHER: Okay. -Chef, coming in to the right. -Yep. <i> [Music] [Music]</i> -How long on that sea bass? -In my hand, Chef, walking. <i> [Music] [Music]</i> Is that the best you can do, Roe? It's falling apart. It's falling apart. GORDON: Were you boiling it rapidly or steaming it? -Steaming it, Chef. -It looks terrible. I always have this problem that the minute I go under on something, I, like, overcompensate <i> on the next and go over.</i> Refire everything, guys-
- garnish, protein, everything. Heard. For some unknown reason, which I don't understand why, <i> Roe was the first pick</i> <i> last night,</i> <i> and I don't know if those</i> <i> are big shoes to fill or what,</i> <i> but she's dropping the ball.</i> How long for table four to come out, the main course, more or less? We're refiring it, everything fresh. -Okay. Perfect. -So I'd rather be a bit slower and perfect than send something that she's not happy with, right? -Okay, perfect. -Piss off. How long--two sea bass, two churrasco? Protein's walking. -How long, sea bass? TREV: Sea bass? <i> [Music] [Music]</i> It's okay? ROE: For the love of God. HEATHER: You good, Roe? -Are you happy with that? MIA: Yes. -Are you happy with that? -Yes, I'm happy with that. -Hallelujah. -That's what I'm talking about. Go. Follow with the broth. -This is the bass. -Oh, my God. All right, listen up, I'm firing a six-top. We're almost there, guys. Keep pushing. Two mackerel, two chicken, two wagyu. -Heard. -Got it. ARIEL: Guys, push for me, okay? MOTTO: Yes, Chef. Let's do it. Let's finish strong. Let's do it, yo. Come on, yo. -You guys are smashing this. -Got you. Service is going so great. We're almost there. <i> We're down</i> <i> to the last six-top.</i> -A-team, what, what? TREV: What? And let's finish as strong as we started. Where are we? Two mackerel, two chicken, two wagyu? TREV: How long on the mackerel? SCOTLEY: 90 seconds. I'll be there in 2 1/2 as long as garnish is ready. This six-top are the executives from the Six Flags Magic Mountain, and I think they looked after you last night, right? ALL: Yes, Chef. -Yes. Let's go. I'm taking your garnish on there. Heard. I'm bringing it right to you. -Hot behind. -Okay. Look, hit me with some vinegar here. Come on, A-Team. KANAE: A-Team. <i> [Music] [Music]</i> Hey, Scotley, that mackerel is sexy, all right? -Nice job. -[smooches] For you, baby. <i> [Music] [Music]</i> Bret, can I get a new chicken refire? GORDON: How burnt is that skin? -My fault, Chef. Sorry, Chef. -The mackerel is cooked. -Won't happen again, Chef. Come on, Bret. We're almost there. Put your big-boy pants on, and let's get this [bleep] rolling. -Bret, I need that chicken. -30 seconds. Let's go. I don't want to give it to you raw, Chef. I [bleep] up with the chicken, so I got to make sure that this chicken's proper, and, yabba dabba doo, -we keep it moving. -Bret, chicken? MOTTO: Come on, Bret. ARIEL: Let's go, Bret. The mackerel's been there two minutes. BRET: Chicken, hot pan. ARIEL: It's raw. GORDON: [bleep]. Bret! -Yes, Chef? -Look at me! -I would be freaking out. -Wake up! -I am awake, Chef! Yeah, well, if you were awake, you wouldn't be cooking [bleep] raw chicken!

I'm having, like, an out-of-body experience right now. Yeah. I said in the beginning I thought Mia was my biggest competition, and I think that she overcame a lot of hurdles, but I think based on my performance <i> that I won Hell's Kitchen.</i> Let's get this over with. <i> I'm gonna beat Ariel</i> because I feel like we're at the same level as far as leadership goes. I feel like my dishes are more creative. So I definitely think I'm the next executive chef at the flagship Hell's Kitchen restaurant in Las Vegas. -(phone ringing) -Scared me. Hi, this is Mia. GORDON: Hi, Mia. I've made my decision. Can you and Ariel please make your way to my office? -Yes, Chef. -Thank you. He said make our way to his office. <i> [Music] [Music]</i> MIA: This is it, girl. MAN: Let's go, Mia! Let's go, Mia! Right, you two, welcome. Ariel, Mia, this has been an extremely difficult decision, let me tell you.

Ariel, right now how are you feeling? Ugh, my stomach is in knots, Chef, to be honest with you. <i> I'm just trying</i> <i> to contain myself</i> and maintain my calm that I've had all season. Mia, what's going through your mind? My heart is racing, but I'm just so proud <i> of what I've accomplished,</i> <i> and I'm really proud of myself,</i> and I'm so grateful for all the faith you've had in me. I could not be prouder of the two of you. In my eyes, you're both winners. BOTH: Thank you, Chef. Mia and Ariel, please step up in front of your doors. BOTH: Yes, Chef. <i> [Music] [Music]</i> <i> MIA: For me,</i> <i> everything is on the line.</i> This is what I want.

Elyse: <i> IS THIS THE HOLY GRAIL</i> <i> OF THE WILD WEST?</i> <i> A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE LEGENDARY</i> <i> WARRIOR CRAZY HORSE.</i> NOBODY HAS EVER PRODUCED A PHOTOGRAPH OF CRAZY HORSE, EVER. Wes: <i> AND IN AN ENCORE PRESENTATION,</i> <i> DOES THIS DIARY HOLD THE KEY</i> <i> TO UNDERSTANDING THE FATE</i> <i> OF A MISSING BOMBER PILOT</i> <i> FROM WORLD WAR II?</i> Elvis Costello: [Music] WATCHIN' THE DETECTIVES [Music] [Music] I GET SO ANGRY WHEN THE TEARDROPS START [Music] [Music] BUT HE CAN'T BE WOUNDED 'CAUSE HE'S GOT NO HEART [Music] [Music] WATCHIN' THE DETECTIVES [Music] [Music] IT'S JUST LIKE WATCHIN' THE DETECTIVES [Music] Gwendolyn: <i> THIS PROGRAM WAS MADE POSSIBLE</i> <i> BY CONTRIBUTIONS</i> <i> TO YOUR PBS STATION</i> <i> FROM VIEWERS LIKE YOU.</i> <i> OUR FIRST STORY EXPLORES</i> <i> WHETHER THIS 1940s RECORDING</i> <i> MAY HAVE HELPED CONVICT</i> <i> THE WOMAN ALLEGED TO BE</i> <i> TOKYO ROSE.</i> <i> WORLD WAR II,</i> <i> THE LONELY PACIFIC:</i> <i> AS MANY AS 2 MILLION SERVICEMEN</i> <i> LISTEN WISTFULLY</i> <i> WHILE A WOMAN'S VOICE</i> <i> FLOATS OVER THE AIRWAVES.</i> Greetings, everybody. This is your number-one enemy, your favorite playmate... <i> THEY CALL HER</i> <i> TOKYO ROSE.</i> <i> MANY G.I.s CONSIDERED HER</i> <i> A GODSEND,</i> <i> A FAMILIAR AMERICAN VOICE</i> <i> KEEPING THEM COMPANY</i> <i> FAR FROM HOME.</i> <i> BUT IN A CELEBRATED</i> <i> POSTWAR TRIAL,</i> <i> PROSECUTORS PORTRAYED HER</i> <i> AS AN AMERICAN DEVIL,</i> <i> A SIREN WHO KNOWINGLY WORKED</i> <i> FOR THE ENEMY,</i> <i> LURING SOLDIERS AND SAILORS,</i> <i> THEN UNDERMINING</i> <i> THEIR FIGHTING SPIRIT.</i> <i> IN 1948, THE WOMAN</i> <i> WHO TWICE SIGNED HER NAME</i> <i> THE ONE AND ORIGINAL</i> <i> TOKYO ROSE</i> <i> WAS BROUGHT BACK FROM JAPAN</i> <i> TO FACE A GRAND JURY.</i> <i> THE WAR HAD ENDED,</i> <i> BUT HER BATTLE HAD JUST BEGUN.</i> <i> NOW BILL MOORE</i> <i> FROM SUN CITY WEST, ARIZONA,</i> <i> HAS AN OBJECT THAT MAY EXPLAIN</i> <i> THE STORY BEHIND</i> <i> HER CONFESSION.</i> MY UNCLE WENT TO JAPAN TO GET TOKYO ROSE. HI, YOU'RE BILL? SO I HEAR YOU HAVE A RECORD TO SHOW ME. IS THIS IT? YES, THIS IS IT. WOW, IT'S UNUSUAL. THIS MUST BE 16 INCHES ACROSS. SIXTEEN INCHES, I THINK. <i> SOMEONE'S WRITTEN TOKYO ROSE</i> <i> ON THE RECORD.</i> <i> BILL FOUND IT WITH HIS MOTHER'S</i> <i> THINGS AFTER SHE PASSED AWAY,</i> <i> BUT HE BELIEVES</i> <i> IT ORIGINALLY BELONGED</i> <i> TO HIS LARGER-THAN-LIFE UNCLE,</i> <i> HARRY BRUNDIDGE.</i> THIS IS MY UNCLE HARRY AND MY AUNT JANET. WHAT DID HE DO? WELL, HE WAS A WAR CORRESPONDENT AND ASSOCIATE EDITOR OF<i> COSMOPOLITAN</i> MAGAZINE. THIS IS YOU, IS THAT RIGHT? OH, YEAH. SO WERE YOU OUT IN THE PACIFIC? TWO YEARS, AND WE USED TO LISTEN TO TOKYO ROSE ALL THE TIME. <i> BILL HAD HEARD THAT HIS UNCLE</i> <i> MET TOKYO ROSE ON ASSIGNMENT</i> <i> AND BELIEVES HE PLAYED</i> <i> A KEY ROLE IN HER PROSECUTION.</i> AFTER THE WAR, HE WENT BACK OVER TO JAPAN AND HE GOT TOKYO ROSE, BROUGHT HER BACK TO SAN FRANCISCO, AND HAD HER INDICTED FOR TREASON. <i> BILL THINKS THE RECORD</i> <i> MAY HAVE BEEN USED</i> <i> AS EVIDENCE</i> <i> IN HER TRIAL,</i> <i> BUT HE'S NEVER BEEN ABLE</i> <i> TO HEAR WHAT'S ON THE RECORDING</i> <i> BECAUSE IT'S TOO LARGE</i> <i> TO PLAY ON STANDARD EQUIPMENT.</i> ALL I KNOW IS THAT -
- OF COURSE, WHAT I HEARD FROM MY FAMILY, THAT THIS WAS PART OF THE TRIAL. WHAT EXACTLY WOULD YOU LIKE FOR ME TO FIND OUT ABOUT YOUR RECORD? I'D LIKE TO FIND OUT WHAT'S ON IT, OF COURSE, AND ABOUT MY UNCLE IN THE TRIAL. I'LL HAVE TO TAKE THIS WITH ME, AND I'D LIKE TO TAKE THE PHOTOGRAPHS, TOO, IF THAT'S OKAY. OH, YOU CAN, YEAH. <i> I FOUND A STUDIO</i> <i> WITH A TURNTABLE</i> <i> THAT CAN PLAY</i> <i> THE OVERSIZED DISC.</i> <i> I'M IN LONG ISLAND CITY,</i> <i> NEW YORK,</i> <i> TO MEET AUDIO ENGINEER</i> <i> GUY ROSMARIN AT VIDIPAX.</i> OOH, WOW, I HAVEN'T SEEN ONE OF THESE IN A WHILE. WHAT IS IT MADE OF? PROBABLY ALUMINUM-BASED. THEY STARTED USING IT AGAIN AFTER THE WAR. YOU COULDN'T USE ALUMINUM DURING THE WAR FOR ANYTHING EXCEPT WAR. THAT'S RIGHT. Female Voice: All right, take it now from five. Tokyo Rose will touch American soil in a few moments and will immediately be taken into custody. <i> WELL, THIS CERTAINLY DOESN'T</i> <i> SOUND LIKE COURTROOM EVIDENCE,</i> <i> BUT BILL'S UNCLE IS DEFINITELY</i> <i> PART OF THE ACTION.</i> We're fortunate today in having two very famous correspondents. Harry Brundidge... <i> GUY HAS MADE A CD COPY FOR ME.</i> <i> BILL'S UNCLE HARRY</i> <i> IS SPEAKING NOW.</i> She just shook hands with me as she came off the boat and recognized me. Female Voice: I noticed that. <i> IVA TOGURI, THE WOMAN</i> <i> WHO WAS TRIED AS TOKYO ROSE,</i> <i> WAS BORN IN LOS ANGELES</i> <i> TO FIRST-GENERATION</i> <i> JAPANESE IMMIGRANTS.</i> <i> SHE LEFT THE U.S.</i> <i> IN THE SUMMER OF '41</i> <i> TO CARE FOR A SICK AUNT</i> <i> IN TOKYO.</i> <i> AFTER PEARL HARBOR,</i> <i> WARTIME BUREAUCRACY</i> <i> MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER</i> <i> TO RETURN TO THE U.S.</i> <i> STRANDED IN JAPAN</i> <i> DURING THE WAR,</i> <i> IVA FOUND A JOB</i> <i> AT RADIO TOKYO AS A TYPIST</i> <i> UNTIL SHE WAS TAPPED</i> <i> TO HOST</i> <i> A JAPANESE WAR</i> <i> PROPAGANDA PROGRAM.</i> <i> IVA'S BROADCASTS WOULD BE</i> <i> AT THE CENTER OF WHAT WAS THEN</i> <i> ONE OF THE COSTLIEST TRIALS</i> <i> IN U.S. HISTORY.</i> THAT TRIAL COST THE U.S. GOVERNMENT $750,000. IN TODAY'S MONEY THAT'S ALMOST $7 MILLION. <i> OF THE EIGHT COUNTS</i> <i> BROUGHT AGAINST HER,</i> <i> THE GRAND JURY FOUND HER GUILTY</i> <i> OF ONLY ONE,</i> <i> ANNOUNCING THE LOSS</i> <i> OF AMERICAN SHIPS.</i> <i> I'M IN NEW YORK CITY,</i> <i> MEETING WITH MEDIA HISTORIAN</i> <i> STEVEN PHIPPS.</i> I'M EAGER FOR YOU TO HEAR THIS. Female Voice: There are crowds here that have been standing since 9:00 this morning waiting to see Tokyo Rose, the girl who undermined the morale -
- or tried to -
- of our boys in the Pacific. WELL, THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A NEWS REPORT, AND IT'S CLEAR THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN SEPTEMBER 25, 1948. <i> STEVEN SAYS THAT'S WHEN IVA</i> <i> RETURNED TO THE UNITED STATES</i> <i> BY MILITARY ESCORT.</i> <i> THE PRESS AND PUBLIC CLAMORED</i> <i> FOR A CLOSER LOOK</i> <i> AT THE WOMAN THE MEDIA</i> <i> HAD ALREADY BRANDED</i> <i> A WARTIME TRAITOR:</i> <i> TOKYO ROSE.</i> BUT THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT SHE WAS<i> THE</i> TOKYO ROSE. IN FACT, THERE WAS NO ONE PERSON WHO WAS<i> THE</i> TOKYO ROSE. <i> AS BILL TOLD ME EARLIER,</i> <i> THE G.I.s USED THAT NAME</i> <i> FOR ALL THE ENGLISH-SPEAKING</i> <i> FEMALE HOSTS</i> <i> BROADCASTING IN THE PACIFIC.</i> THE JAPANESE FELT THAT USING A WOMAN ANNOUNCER WOULD MAKE THE G.I.s MORE PRONE TO LISTEN AND THAT IT WOULD TEND TO MAKE THEM HOMESICK. <i> WHY DID BRUNDIDGE CLAIM</i> <i> IVA WAS TOKYO ROSE?</i> <i> STEVEN HAS DONE SOME DIGGING</i> <i> ON THE REPORTER'S BACKGROUND.</i> I FOUND QUITE A FEW ARTICLES ON BRUNDIDGE, SINCE I KNOW THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN HIM. <i> MUCH OF HIS EARLY CAREER</i> <i> WAS IN ST. LOUIS,</i> <i> REPORTING ON THE MOB.</i> <i> STEVEN DISCOVERED BRUNDIDGE</i> <i> HAD A FLAIR FOR THE DRAMATIC</i> <i> AND OFTEN PLAYED FAST AND LOOSE</i> <i> WITH THE FACTS.</i> HERE'S ONE FROM 1930. THIS ONE IS CALLED CALL BRUNDIDGE STORY HEARSAY. SO FOR YEARS HE'D BEEN KNOWN AS SOMEONE WHO WAS PUSHING THE TRUTH ON HIS STORIES. WELL, YES. <i> WHAT WAS HIS INVOLVEMENT</i> <i> IN THE TOKYO ROSE STORY?</i> LET ME SHOW YOU IN THIS ARTICLE. <i> IT'S A MAY 1948</i> <i> FRONT-PAGE STORY</i> <i> FROM</i> THE NASHVILLE TENNESSEAN. <i> THAT'S FOUR MONTHS BEFORE</i> <i> THE DATE ON OUR RECORDING.</i> <i> IN IT, BRUNDIDGE DETAILS</i> <i> HIS TIME IN JAPAN</i> <i> HUNTING FOR EMPEROR HIROHITO,</i> <i> THEN FOR TOKYO ROSE.</i> <i> IN HIS STORY, BRUNDIDGE TAKES</i> <i> CREDIT FOR HER INDICTMENT.</i> THERE'S A REFERENCE TO SECRET WITNESSES THAT BRUNDIDGE CAME UP WITH. BUT DO WE KNOW WHO THEY WERE? I HAVE NO CLUE. <i> STEVEN GIVES ME THE NAME</i> <i> OF A JOURNALIST</i> <i> WHO REVISITED THIS STORY</i> <i> IN THE 1970s.</i> <i> RON YATES,</i> <i> ONCE THE TOKYO BUREAU CHIEF</i> <i> OF THE</i> CHICAGO TRIBUNE, <i> WROTE A SERIES OF ARTICLES</i> <i> IN 1976</i> <i> ON THE TOKYO ROSE TRIAL.</i> <i> WE'VE AGREED TO MEET</i> <i> AT THE JAPANESE AMERICAN</i> <i> NATIONAL MUSEUM IN LOS ANGELES.</i> WELL, HERE'S THE RECORD I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT, RON. OH, WOW, LOOK AT THAT. I'M INVESTIGATING A MAN NAMED HARRY BRUNDIDGE. THEY MENTION HIM ON THIS RECORDING. DO YOU KNOW WHO HE WAS? OH, YEAH, HARRY BRUNDIDGE IS A VERY INTERESTING CHARACTER. <i> RON EXPLAINS</i> <i> HOW HARRY BRUNDIDGE</i> <i> HAD FIRST BECOME INVOLVED</i> <i> WITH TOKYO ROSE</i> <i> THREE YEARS BEFORE THE TRIAL</i> <i> IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH</i> <i> OF WORLD WAR II.</i> <i> THAT'S WHEN BRUNDIDGE</i> <i> HOOKED UP WITH</i> <i> VETERAN WAR CORRESPONDENT</i> <i> CLARK LEE.</i> <i> THEY HEADED TO JAPAN</i> <i> IN 1945</i> <i> IN PURSUIT OF THE SCOOP</i> <i> OF A LIFETIME.</i> THEY THOUGHT, WE'LL FIND TOKYO ROSE AND THAT'LL BE OUR STORY. THEY SAID, WE WILL PAY HER $2,000 IF SHE'LL COME TO THE IMPERIAL HOTEL TO BE INTERVIEWED. <i> IN WAR-TORN TOKYO, WHERE</i> <i> MOST PEOPLE WERE STARVING,</i> <i> THAT MONEY MIGHT GET HER HOME</i> <i> TO THE UNITED STATES.</i> BUT WHEN SHE WALKED INTO THE ROOM, THIS WAS NOT WHAT THEY WERE EXPECTING. <i> IN HER PIGTAILS</i> <i> AND SADDLE SHOES,</i> <i> IVA NEITHER LOOKED</i> <i> NOR SOUNDED THE PART</i> <i> OF THE MATAHARI OF THE EAST.</i> <i> RON SHOWS ME A REENACTMENT</i> <i> OF A</i> ZERO HOUR<i> BROADCAST</i> <i> THAT IVA LATER AGREED TO DO</i> <i> FOR THE U.S. ARMY IN TOKYO.</i> Greetings, everybody. This is your number-one enemy, your favorite playmate, Orphan Ann, ready again for a vicious assault on your morale. <i> RON EXPLAINS THAT</i> <i> ALL THE SCRIPTS</i> <i> WERE WRITTEN</i> <i> BY ALLIED P.O.W.s,</i> <i> WHO ALSO HAD BEEN FORCED</i> <i> TO WORK FOR RADIO TOKYO.</i> <i> THE LANGUAGE WAS INTENDED</i> <i> TO BE TONGUE-IN-CHEEK,</i> <i> THE KIND OF TEASING</i> <i> THAT AMERICANS</i> <i> WOULD EASILY RECOGNIZE.</i> AND THEY'D ALWAYS GO OVER THE SCRIPTS WITH HER AND SAY, HERE'S WHAT WE WANT YOU TO SAY, IVA. AND THEN SHE WOULD SAY THESE THINGS, LIKE HELLO, MY HONORABLE BONEHEADS OF THE PACIFIC. THIS IS YOUR FAVORITE ENEMY, ORPHAN ANN. I'M GOING TO SNEAK UP BEHIND YOU WITH MY NAIL FILE. YOU SEE IN HER FACE THAT SHE KNOWS SHE'S SAYING THINGS THAT WOULD SOUND MEAN TO THE JAPANESE BUT THAT IT'S ACTUALLY AN INSIDE JOKE AMONG ALL THE AMERICANS. RIGHT, THERE'S A REAL FACETIOUSNESS TO IT. <i> WHEN BRUNDIDGE AND LEE</i> <i> INTERVIEWED IVA IN 1945,</i> <i> THAT TEASING TONE NEVER MADE IT</i> <i> INTO THEIR NOTES.</i> <i> THEY HAD OTHER PLANS.</i> THE STORY JUST WASN'T THERE. THIS WAS NOT THE SIREN OF THE PACIFIC. <i> BRUNDIDGE TOOK OUT THE CONTRACT</i> <i> FOR $2,000,</i> <i> THEN ASKED IVA</i> <i> A FATEFUL QUESTION.</i> JUST FOR THE HECK OF IT, WOULD YOU JUST SIGN THIS AS TOKYO ROSE? AND SHE SAID, SURE. WHAT HE DID WAS HE TOOK THOSE NOTES AND GAVE THEM TO THE OCCUPATION FORCES, AUTHORITIES, AND SAID, I HAVE THE SIGNED CONFESSION OF TOKYO ROSE HERE. AND WITHIN A FEW DAYS SHE WAS ARRESTED. <i> SHE WAS FIRST IMPRISONED</i> <i> IN TOKYO UNDER MARTIAL LAW</i> <i> AND HELD FOR A YEAR</i> <i> WHILE THE ARMY</i> <i> COUNTER INTELLIGENCE CORPS</i> <i> INVESTIGATED.</i> <i> FINDING NO EVIDENCE</i> <i> OF TREASON,</i> <i> THE WAR DEPARTMENT CLEARED</i> <i> AND FINALLY RELEASED HER.</i> <i> THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN</i> <i> THE END OF IT.</i> SO BRUNDIDGE MET HER IN '45, '46 SHE'S RELEASED FROM PRISON, HOW DID IT BECOME A STORY AGAIN IN 1948? THAT IS A STORY IN ITSELF. <i> AFTER BEING FREED</i> <i> BY THE U.S. ARMY,</i> <i> IVA HAD APPLIED</i> <i> FOR REPATRIATION.</i> <i> BUT THE POPULAR RADIO HOST</i> <i> WALTER WINCHELL</i> <i> LEARNED OF THE REQUEST</i> <i> AND STARTED A CAMPAIGN</i> <i> TO PREVENT HER RETURN</i> <i> AND TRY HER FOR TREASON.</i> GOLD STAR MOTHERS -
- THESE ARE MOTHERS WHO HAD LOST THEIR SONS FIGHTING IN THE PACIFIC -
- BEGAN WRITING TO WALTER WINCHELL, HE FORWARDED THOSE TO THE TRUMAN ADMINISTRATION, AND THAT PRESSURE BEGAN TO BUILD. <i> IT WAS AN ELECTION YEAR.</i> <i> RON SAYS CHARGES OF BEING SOFT</i> <i> ON COMMUNISTS AND TRAITORS</i> <i> WAS A CRITICAL FACTOR</i> <i> IN TRUMAN'S CLOSE PRESIDENTIAL</i> <i> RACE AGAINST THOMAS DEWEY.</i> THE TRUMAN ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T WANT TO BE PERCEIVED AS BEING SOFT ON TRAITORS. <i> THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</i> <i> ISSUED A REQUEST FOR WITNESSES</i> <i> TO IVA'S ALLEGED ACTS</i> <i> OF TREASON.</i> SO HERE COMES BRUNDIDGE AGAIN. <i> WHEN BRUNDIDGE MET UP WITH</i> <i> ATTORNEY GENERAL TOM CLARK,</i> <i> HE OFFERED TO GET</i> <i> A NEW CONFESSION FROM IVA</i> <i> AND TO FIND WITNESSES</i> <i> TO HELP CONVICT HER.</i> TOM CLARK ASSIGNS SOME OF HIS MINIONS TO GO BACK TO TOKYO, AND HARRY BRUNDIDGE GOES WITH THEM. <i> RON SAYS IT WASN'T UNTIL</i> <i> A QUARTER-CENTURY</i> <i> AFTER IVA'S TRIAL</i> <i> THAT HE UNLOCKED</i> <i> A CRUCIAL PIECE</i> <i> OF THE GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGY.</i> <i> RON ARRANGED TO MEET TWO MEN</i> <i> WHO HAD HELD ON TO A SECRET:</i> <i> GEORGE MITSUSHIO</i> <i> AND KEN OKI,</i> <i> IVA'S OLD BOSSES</i> <i> FROM RADIO TOKYO.</i> THEY SAID, WE -
- OUR TESTIMONY IS WHAT CONVICTED HER, AND IT WAS ALL A LIE. THEY HAD BEEN COACHED FOR TWO MONTHS BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IN WHAT THEY SHOULD SAY AT THE TRIAL. AND THEIR TESTIMONY WAS THE SIXTH OF THE EIGHT COUNTS WHICH SHE WAS INDICTED ON, THAT SHE DID SPEAK INTO A MICROPHONE ABOUT THE LOSS OF SHIPS. <i> BUT WHAT ABOUT</i> <i> BRUNDIDGE'S CLAIMS</i> <i> OF FINDING ADDITIONAL</i> <i> SECRET WITNESSES?</i> I KNOW THE PERFECT PERSON TO TELL YOU ABOUT THEM. <i> I'M MEETING WITH BARBARA</i> <i> TREMBLEY AT DARKWOOD STUDIOS.</i> <i> BARBARA MET IVA</i> <i> 20 YEARS AGO.</i> <i> OVER TIME THEY BECAME FRIENDS.</i> <i> IVA AGREED TO TELL</i> <i> HER FULL STORY</i> <i> AND GAVE BARBARA THE RIGHTS</i> <i> TO MAKE HER SAGA</i> <i> INTO A FEATURE FILM.</i> I HAVE A RECORDING THAT IS DESCRIBING THE MOMENT WHEN IVA COMES BACK TO THE UNITED STATES. <i> I TELL BARBARA THAT</i> <i> ON THIS RECORDING</i> <i> BRUNDIDGE BOASTS OF GETTING IVA</i> <i> TO SIGN A NEW CONFESSION.</i> WHY IS IVA EVEN WILLING TO SEE HIM, MUCH LESS TO SIGN THIS DOCUMENT? SHE HAD JUST LOST HER BABY. <i> BARBARA EXPLAINS THAT IVA</i> <i> HAD JUST SUFFERED A MISCARRIAGE</i> <i> AND DESPERATELY WANTED</i> <i> TO GET HOME TO THE STATES.</i> <i> IVA TOLD BARBARA THAT</i> <i> BRUNDIDGE HAD ASSURED HER</i> <i> THAT SIGNING THE DOCUMENT</i> <i> WAS A PASSPORT HOME.</i> AND THEN AS SOON AS SHE SIGNED IT, BRUNDIDGE LEANED OVER TO IVA AND HE SAID, YOU'VE DONE YOURSELF A GOOD DEAL. THEY'LL NEVER EXECUTE A WOMAN. SHE LOST HER HEART AT THAT POINT. BRUNDIDGE HAD WRITTEN ABOUT SECRET WITNESSES THAT WOULD PROVE THE CASE AGAINST IVA. YES, MR. YAGI. YAGI WAS ACTUALLY SOMEONE THAT BRUNDIDGE HAD KNOWN BEFORE THE WAR. <i> BARBARA SAYS THAT WHEN</i> <i> BRUNDIDGE TRAVELED TO JAPAN,</i> <i> HIROM YAGI ACTED AS A FIXER,</i> <i> MAKING LOCAL INTRODUCTIONS</i> <i> FOR THE JOURNALIST.</i> BRUNDIDGE LITERALLY BRIBED HIM. HE SAID, YOU WILL GET A TRIP TO THE U.S. AND WE'LL HAVE A WONDERFUL TIME. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TESTIFY FOR THE GRAND JURY, AND THIS IS ALL YOU HAVE TO SAY. <i> BARBARA FOUND</i> <i> THE HANDWRITTEN TESTIMONY</i> <i> YAGI HAD GIVEN BRUNDIDGE</i> <i> AND THE U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL.</i> I HEARD HER SAY INTO THE MICROPHONE, 'YOUR WIVES ARE OUT WITH WAR WORKERS.' SO DOES HE TESTIFY AT THE TRIAL BEFORE THE GRAND JURY? YES, HE DOES. BUT AS SOON AS HE GETS BACK TO JAPAN, HE RECANTS. YAGI EVEN WRITES A LETTER TO BRUNDIDGE ASKING HIM TO PLEASE STOP THIS BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. DEAR MR. BRUNDIDGE, THIS IS AN ELEVENTH HOUR APPEAL ASKING YOU TO USE YOUR GOOD INFLUENCES TO CALL OFF THE COMING TRIAL, IF POSSIBLE. <i> BARBARA EXPLAINS THAT BY NOW</i> <i> THE GOVERNMENT</i> <i> HAD SERIOUS DOUBTS</i> <i> ABOUT BRUNDIDGE</i> <i> AND EVEN BEGAN TO INVESTIGATE</i> <i> HIM FOR WITNESS TAMPERING,</i> <i> BUT THEY HAD TOO MUCH INVESTED</i> <i> IN THE TRIAL TO BACK OUT NOW.</i> THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, TOM CLARK, AND SO ON, THEY PUT A LID ON IT AND IT BECAME A COVER-UP. <i> THE TRIAL PROCEEDED</i> <i> AS PLANNED,</i> <i> BUT DID IT GO ON</i> <i> WITH BRUNDIDGE?</i> THAT'S WHEN IT BECOMES VERY INTERESTING. <i> THE CONFIDENTIAL FILES</i> <i> OF FBI DIRECTOR J. EDGAR HOOVER</i> <i> WERE OPENED IN 2005.</i> <i> IN THOSE DOCUMENTS</i> <i> BARBARA HAS FOUND</i> <i> SOME ANSWERS FOR BILL.</i> LET ME PLAY FOR YOU WHAT'S ON YOUR RECORD, AND THEN WE HEAR A VOICE YOU MAY RECOGNIZE. Brundidge on recording: I went back at the request of the attorney general last March, and Rose willingly signed it. I RECOGNIZE HIS VOICE. THAT WAS MY UNCLE HARRY. <i> I TELL BILL</i> <i> ABOUT HIS UNCLE'S ROLE</i> <i> IN LINKING</i> <i> THE REAL-LIFE IVA TOGURI</i> <i> AND THE FABLED TOKYO ROSE.</i> THAT'S SAD, ISN'T IT? YEAH. HE PROBABLY DID MOST ANYTHING TO GET A STORY, AND THAT WAS A BIG STORY. YOU'D WANTED TO KNOW WHAT PART HARRY BRUNDIDGE PLAYED IN THIS TRIAL. WHEN HE MENTIONED THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE HAD SENT HIM BACK, THAT'S WHERE THE STORY BECOMES LARGER THAN JUST YOUR UNCLE. SO WHAT WAS BRUNDIDGE'S ROLE IN THE TRIAL? WELL, BRUNDIDGE HAD NO ROLE IN THE TRIAL. THEY DIDN'T ALLOW HIM TO TESTIFY. THE FBI, THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE: HE WAS SUCH A HOT POTATO, NOBODY WANTED TO GET NEAR HIM. <i> ON ONE INTERNAL MEMO,</i> <i> BARBARA DISCOVERED</i> <i> THAT J. EDGAR HOOVER</i> <i> HAD WEIGHED IN</i> <i> ON BRUNDIDGE'S</i> <i> SO-CALLED WITNESS</i> <i> RECANTING HIS TESTIMONY.</i> I'M NOT SURPRISED AT DEVELOPMENTS. IT WAS MOST UNWISE FOR DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO USE SUCH A PERSON AS BRUNDIDGE IN THE FIRST PLACE. THEY REALIZED THE WHOLE CASE COULD BE BLOWN UP IF HE TESTIFIED. HE FINALLY WENT TO THE DEFENSE AND OFFERED TO TESTIFY FOR THEM, AND THEY WOULDN'T TOUCH HIM EITHER. GEE, THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE. YOU KNOW, BACK IN WAR TIMES, PEOPLE LOOKED UPON THE JAPANESE REALLY BAD, AND IT DIDN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE WHETHER THEY WERE AMERICANS OR -
- LOOK AT ALL THE INTERNEES THEY HAD, AND THEY WERE GOOD PEOPLE. THEY WERE. BILL, I REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THIS RECORD AND GIVING ME A CHANCE TO SEE THIS LARGER HISTORY. THANK YOU. THANK<i> YOU.</i> I'M GLAD ALL THIS CAME OUT. I APPRECIATE THE WISDOM WITH WHICH YOU HEARD THE STORY. <i> GIVEN THE NEW PUBLIC</i> <i> DISCLOSURES</i> <i> ABOUT IVA'S INNOCENCE</i> <i> AND THE PERJURED TESTIMONY</i> <i> AGAINST HER,</i> <i> PRESIDENT FORD AGREED</i> <i> TO LOOK INTO HER CASE.</i> <i> IN HIS LAST OFFICIAL ACT</i> <i> IN OFFICE,</i> <i> HE GRANTED IVA TOGURI A FULL</i> <i> AND UNCONDITIONAL PARDON</i> <i> ON JANUARY 19, 1977.</i> <i> SHE PASSED AWAY</i> <i> IN 2006.</i> TWELVE AMERICANS WERE TRIED FOR TREASON AFTER WORLD WAR II. SEVEN WERE RADIO BROADCASTERS. AXIS SALLY WAS ONE OF THE MOST INFAMOUS. BORN MILDRED GILLARS, SHE DREAMT OF BECOMING A STARLET. WITH LITTLE THEATER SUCCESS, GILLARS MOVED TO GERMANY IN THE MID-1930s AND WORKED FOR RADIO BERLIN. FROM DECEMBER 1941 TO MAY 1945, GILLARS' SULTRY VOICE REACHED AMERICAN G.I.s WITH PRO-GERMAN WAR UPDATES DESIGNED TO DEPLETE MORALE. GILLARS' BROADCASTS CAME UNDER THE AUSPICES OF JOSEPH GOEBBELS, HITLER'S PROPAGANDA MINISTER. SHE POSED AS AN AMERICAN RED CROSS VOLUNTEER, INTERVIEWING AMERICAN P.O.W.s BUT DISTORTING THEIR COMMENTS. SHE CRITICIZED ROOSEVELT AND CHURCHILL AND MUSED ABOUT THE UNFAITHFULNESS OF G.I. WIVES AND GIRLFRIENDS BACK HOME. AXIS SALLY'S MOST INFAMOUS BROADCAST, VISION OF INVASION, TARGETED AMERICAN TROOPS AWAITING D-DAY. GILLARS PLAYED A G.I. MOTHER DREAMING OF HER SON'S DEATH. CRIES OF THE WOUNDED PLAYED IN THE BACKGROUND, CREATING THE IMPRESSION OF IMPENDING SLAUGHTER. The boys will be killed or crippled for the rest of their lives. AFTER THE WAR, GILLARS WAS EXTRADITED TO THE U.S. SHE WAS FOUND GUILTY OF TREASON AND SENTENCED TO 10 TO 30 YEARS IN PRISON. IN 1961, GILLARS LEFT JAIL TO LIVE IN A CONVENT AND TEACH CATHOLIC SCHOOL. SHE DIED IN 1988. Elyse: <i> OUR NEXT STORY GOES IN SEARCH</i> <i> OF A NATIVE-AMERICAN LEGEND.</i> <i> MORE THAN 125 YEARS</i> <i> AFTER HIS DEATH,</i> <i> THE NAME CRAZY HORSE</i> <i> STILL ECHOES</i> <i> IN THE BLACK HILLS</i> <i> OF SOUTH DAKOTA.</i> <i> IN LIFE, THE LAKOTA WARRIOR</i> <i> AND SPIRITUAL MAN</i> <i> VOWED TO PROTECT</i> <i> THESE SACRED HUNTING GROUNDS</i> <i> FROM ENCROACHING SETTLERS</i> <i> AND GOLD MINERS.</i> <i> IN 1876, HE HELPED CRUSH</i> <i> THE U.S. CAVALRY TROOPS</i> <i> OF GENERAL GEORGE CUSTER AT THE</i> <i> BATTLE OF THE LITTLE BIGHORN.</i> <i> BUT IS THIS A TRUE LIKENESS</i> <i> OF THE WARRIOR?</i> <i> DESPITE HIS FAME, CRAZY HORSE</i> <i> REFUSED TO BE PHOTOGRAPHED,</i> <i> SHUNNING WHITES</i> <i> AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES.</i> <i> FOR YEARS, RUMORS</i> <i> OF CRAZY HORSE PHOTOGRAPHS</i> <i> HAVE TANTALIZED COLLECTORS.</i> <i> MORE THAN 125 YEARS</i> <i> AFTER THE WARRIOR'S DEATH,</i> <i> TIM GIAGO</i> <i> OF RAPID CITY, SOUTH DAKOTA,</i> <i> HAS A FRAMED IMAGE</i> <i> WHICH MAY BE</i> <i> THE ONLY PHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGE</i> <i> OF THIS LEGEND.</i> IT SAID, TASUNKA WITKO, AND TASUNKA WITKO IS THE LAKOTA NAME THAT MEANS CRAZY HORSE. <i> I'M MEETING TIM AT HIS HOME</i> <i> TO FIND OUT MORE.</i> HI. WELCOME TO MY HOUSE. THANK YOU. WELL, ABOUT 27 YEARS AGO, A CONSTRUCTION MANAGER CAME INTO MY NEWSPAPER,<i> THE LAKOTA TIMES,</i> AND HE HAD THIS WITH HIM. ONE OF HIS EMPLOYEES, A LAKOTA MAN, HAD PUT IT IN HOCK AND SAID HE COULD HAVE IT IF HE WENT DOWN AND TOOK IT OUT OF PAWN. SO HE BROUGHT IT DOWN TO MY NEWSPAPER. ALONG WITH THAT WAS THIS LETTER WHICH IS DATED 1904. IT'S WRITTEN ENTIRELY IN THE VERY OLD LAKOTA LANGUAGE. IT SAYS THAT TASUNKA WITKO, WHICH MEANS CRAZY HORSE. WHAT DO YOU KNOW SPECIFICALLY ABOUT CRAZY HORSE? CRAZY HORSE WAS REALLY ONE OF THE GREAT WARRIORS OF THE LAKOTA. PEOPLE SAID THAT BULLETS COULDN'T HIT HIM. ONE OF THE REASONS HE'S SO ADMIRED AND LOVED BY THE LAKOTA PEOPLE TODAY IS HE WOULD NEVER SIGN A TREATY. HE NEVER SOLD OUT ANY LAND OR ANY OF HIS PEOPLE, AND TO ME THAT'S HIGHLY ADMIRABLE. <i> BUT WHAT CRAZY HORSE LOOKS LIKE</i> <i> HAS LONG BEEN A MYSTERY.</i> DO YOU KNOW OF ANY OTHER PHOTOGRAPHS OF CRAZY HORSE? I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE. I'VE SEEN PHOTOGRAPHS THAT WERE DISPROVED, THAT THAT'S NOT CRAZY HORSE, ALWAYS PROVED TO BE SOMEONE ELSE. I WOULD LIKE YOU TO FIND OUT VERY MUCH WHETHER THIS IS INDEED A TRUE PICTURE OF CRAZY HORSE. <i> IT'S JUST AS TIM SUGGESTED.</i> <i> THERE ARE A NUMBER</i> <i> OF DISPUTED IMAGES</i> <i> CLAIMING TO BE CRAZY HORSE.</i> <i> MOST OF THEM HAVE</i> <i> PRETTY SHAKY STORIES,</i> <i> AND NONE RESEMBLE OUR GUY.</i> <i> THERE'S NOTHING OBVIOUS</i> <i> TO SUGGEST OUR MAN</i> <i> IS EVEN A WARRIOR CHIEF,</i> <i> NO WAR BONNET</i> <i> OR ELABORATE DECORATION.</i> HE DOES HAVE A COLLAR ON AND AN EAGLE FEATHER, BUT BESIDES THAT, HE'S DRESSED PRETTY PLAINLY. <i> I'M TRYING TO TAKE</i> <i> THE BACK OFF CAREFULLY.</i> <i> IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S</i> <i> MORE LAKOTA WRITING</i> <i> ALONG WITH THE DATE, 1875.</i> AH, NOW, THIS IS HELPFUL. <i> HERE AGAIN, CRAZY HORSE</i> <i> AND 1875 IN HANDWRITING.</i> <i> BUT THERE'S ALSO</i> <i> A STAMPED NAME AND ADDRESS.</i> ALEX GARDNER, 921 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE, WASHINGTON, D.C. <i> LET ME DO SOME DIGGING.</i> <i> THERE WAS AN ALEXANDER GARDNER</i> <i> WHO WAS A CELEBRATED</i> <i> PHOTOGRAPHER</i> <i> IN THE 19th CENTURY.</i> <i> HE PHOTOGRAPHED</i> <i> ABRAHAM LINCOLN.</i> <i> I'M NOT CERTAIN</i> <i> THEY WERE THE SAME PERSON,</i> <i> BUT ALEXANDER GARDNER</i> <i> WAS A SCOTTISH SOCIALIST</i> <i> WHO HAD GOTTEN INTERESTED</i> <i> IN PHOTOGRAPHY</i> <i> AFTER SEEING</i> <i> MATTHEW BRADY'S WORK.</i> <i> BRADY AND GARDNER BECAME</i> <i> THE TWO BEST KNOWN</i> <i> PHOTOGRAPHERS OF THE CIVIL WAR.</i> <i> BUT IT SEEMS THAT A NUMBER</i> <i> OF GARDNER'S BATTLEFIELD IMAGES</i> <i> FROM THE WAR</i> <i> WERE CONTROVERSIAL.</i> HE ACTUALLY MOVED BODIES ON THE CIVIL WAR BATTLEFIELDS TO BETTER SUIT HIS PHOTOGRAPHIC NEEDS. <i> AND THIS IS INTERESTING:</i> <i> GARDNER TRAVELED TO</i> <i> THE LAKOTA TERRITORIES IN 1868</i> <i> TO PHOTOGRAPH NEGOTIATIONS</i> <i> BETWEEN NORTHERN PLAIN TRIBES</i> <i> AND THE GOVERNMENT.</i> <i> THE FORT LARAMIE TREATY</i> <i> ESTABLISHED</i> <i> THE GREAT SIOUX RESERVATION</i> <i> AND PROTECTED THE BLACK HILLS</i> <i> FOR THE LAKOTA.</i> <i> IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THIS IS</i> <i> AN ALEXANDER GARDNER PHOTOGRAPH</i> <i> AND THAT GARDNER MET</i> <i> CRAZY HORSE,</i> <i> BUT THE DATE ON OUR PHOTO,</i> <i> IF IT'S ACCURATE,</i> <i> IS SEVEN YEARS AFTER</i> <i> GARDNER PHOTOGRAPHED</i> <i> THE LAKOTA TREATIES.</i> I THINK THE FIRST THING THAT I NEED TO DO IS FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT THIS NOTE SAYS. <i> I'M HEADED TO</i> <i> OGLALA LAKOTA COLLEGE</i> <i> IN RAPID CITY.</i> <i> LAKOTA LANGUAGE AND CULTURE</i> <i> PROFESSOR WILMER MESTETH</i> <i> IS SKEPTICAL OF OUR IMAGE.</i> <i> HE EXPLAINS WHY CRAZY HORSE</i> <i> REJECTED PHOTOGRAPHY.</i> IN ORAL HISTORY THEY SAID HE MADE A STATEMENT THAT THESE PHOTOGRAPHS WERE EVIL AND THAT ANYBODY THAT TOOK THEIR PHOTOGRAPH, THEIR SOUL WAS CAPTURED IN THE PICTURE. <i> CRAZY HORSE'S REJECTION</i> <i> OF THE WHITE MAN'S TECHNOLOGY</i> <i> WAS PART OF HIS DEFENSE OF THE</i> <i> BESIEGED LAKOTA WAY OF LIFE.</i> <i> THE 1868 TREATY</i> <i> OF FORT LARAMIE</i> <i> HAD GUARANTEED THE LAKOTA</i> <i> THEIR TRIBAL LANDS,</i> <i> BUT JUST SIX YEARS LATER,</i> <i> THE TREATY WOULD BE VIOLATED.</i> IN 1874, THERE WAS AN EXPEDITION THAT CAME DOWN INTO THE BLACK HILLS IN SEARCH OF GOLD, LED BY GENERAL CUSTER, AND THEY DID FIND GOLD IN THE BLACK HILLS. <i> TWO YEARS LATER,</i> <i> IN JUNE 1876,</i> <i> CRAZY HORSE HELPED DEFEAT</i> <i> GENERAL CUSTER</i> <i> AT THE BATTLE</i> <i> OF THE LITTLE BIGHORN.</i> <i> IT WAS THE WORST U.S. MILITARY</i> <i> DEFEAT OF THE INDIAN WARS.</i> <i> ALTHOUGH MANY</i> <i> SIOUX CONTEMPORARIES</i> <i> WERE PHOTOGRAPHED,</i> <i> THE LAKOTA HAVE RELIED</i> <i> ON ORAL HISTORY</i> <i> FOR A DESCRIPTION</i> <i> OF CRAZY HORSE.</i> THEY SAID HE WAS OF MEDIUM HEIGHT, HIS HAIR WAS LIGHT IN COLOR, AND HIS COMPLEXION WAS LIGHT. AND HE HAD A MYSTERIOUS AURA ABOUT HIM. THEY SAID YOU COULD ALMOST FEEL HIS PRESENCE AND HIS STRENGTH AS A POWERFUL MAN. THIS IS THE LETTER THAT CAME WITH THE PHOTOGRAPH. WHAT DO YOU THINK? THIS LETTER IS WRITTEN IN OLD LAKOTA ORTHOGRAPHY, IN LAKOTA LANGUAGE. <i> WILMER TELLS ME THAT OLD LAKOTA</i> <i> WAS USED FOR A HUNED YEARS,</i> <i> UNTIL ABOUT 1960.</i> [ reading in Lakota ] THIS PHOTOGRAPH IS A PHOTOGRAPH OF CRAZY HORSE. WHAT ELSE DOES IT SAY? [ reading in Lakota ] THE WAY YOU WOULD RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS HE IS THERE IS A SCAR ON HIS LEFT CHEEK. IS IT TRUE THAT CRAZY HORSE HAD A SCAR? YES, CRAZY HORSE WAS SHOT BY A MAN CALLED NO WATER IN A JEALOUS RAGE. HE SHOT TO KILL CRAZY HORSE BUT GRAZED HIM ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE CHEEK. <i> THE MAN ON THE PHOTO</i> <i> IS FAVORING HIS RIGHT.</i> <i> IF THERE'S A SCAR ON THE LEFT,</i> <i> I CAN'T TELL.</i> THEN IT SAYS, WE WERE WITH CRAZY HORSE WAY BACK THEN. THIS IS ME, DEWEY BEARD. <i> WILMER THINKS THAT</i> <i> DEWEY BEARD</i> <i> MAY HAVE DICTATED THE STORY</i> <i> TO SOMEONE,</i> <i> POSSIBLY TO THIS B.B.E.</i> <i> SIGNED AT THE BOTTOM.</i> AND WHO WAS DEWEY BEARD? DEWEY BEARD WAS THERE AT THE LITTLE BIGHORN AT THE AGE OF 10 YEARS OLD. AND POSSIBLY KNEW CRAZY HORSE. I'M PRETTY SURE THIS PERSON KNEW CRAZY HORSE, YES. IN YOUR OPINION, DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANY POSSIBILITY THAT THIS COULD BE CRAZY HORSE? I DON'T THINK SO. THIS PERSON IN THIS PHOTOGRAPH IS OF DARKER COMPLEXION. CRAZY HORSE HIMSELF WAS LIGHT-COMPLECTED. <i> I'M NOT SURE WHAT</i> <i> TO MAKE OF THIS.</i> <i> WILMER THINKS THE NOTE</i> <i> IS LEGITIMATE.</i> <i> STILL, HISTORY'S VERDICT</i> <i> STANDS IN OUR WAY.</i> NOBODY'S EVER PRODUCED A PHOTOGRAPH OF CRAZY HORSE, EVER. <i> WILMER SUGGESTED I VISIT</i> <i> THE CRAZY HORSE MEMORIAL</i> <i> IN THE BLACK HILLS.</i> <i> SCULPTOR KORCZAK ZIOLKOWSKI</i> <i> BEGAN THE MASSIVE CARVING</i> <i> IN THE 1940s...</i> <i> AND TODAY IT REMAINS</i> <i> THE WORLD'S LARGEST</i> <i> MOUNTAIN SCULPTURE</i> <i> IN PROGRESS.</i> <i> THE MONUMENT IS A TESTAMENT TO</i> <i> THE IMPORTANCE OF HIS MEMORY,</i> <i> BUT WHERE IS THE PHYSICAL MODEL</i> <i> FOR THE MASSIVE FACE?</i> <i> DOUG WAR EAGLE IS</i> <i> CRAZY HORSE'S GRANDSON.</i> HOW WAS THE MONUMENT BUILT? I MEAN, HOW DO WE KNOW WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE? IT'S JUST THE CLOSEST REPLICA OF HIM. THERE NEVER WAS A PHOTO EVER TAKEN OF OUR GRANDFATHER. <i> HE SAYS THE MONUMENT REPRESENTS</i> <i> CRAZY HORSE'S SPIRIT</i> <i> RATHER THAN HIS EXACT IMAGE.</i> <i> WHEN I SHOW DOUG OUR PHOTO,</i> <i> RIGHT AWAY HE'S SKEPTICAL.</i> THIS MAN HAS AN EAGLE FEATHER IN HIS HAIR. OUR GRANDFATHER NEVER WORE AN EAGLE FEATHER IN HIS HAIR. OUR GRANDPA WEARS THE RED-TAILED HAWK FEATHER WITH THE BUFFALO BONE. <i> DOUG'S BROUGHT SOMETHING</i> <i> TO SHOW ME</i> <i> THAT FEW OUTSIDE HIS FAMILY</i> <i> HAVE SEEN.</i> I'VE BROUGHT TWO SKETCHES OF OUR GRANDFATHER'S. THE FIRST ONE IS WAGLULA, OLD MAN CRAZY HORSE. <i> HE SAYS THE WARRIOR</i> <i> CRAZY HORSE</i> <i> WAS ACTUALLY THE THIRD MAN</i> <i> TO CARRY THAT NAME.</i> <i> IN ACCORDANCE</i> <i> WITH LAKOTA TRADITION,</i> <i> CRAZY HORSE INHERITED THE NAME</i> <i> FROM THIS MAN, HIS FATHER,</i> <i> WHEN HE BECAME A WARRIOR.</i> AND THE OTHER SKETCH I HAVE HERE IS OF THE WARRIOR. <i> IT WAS SKETCHED LONG AFTER</i> <i> HIS DEATH IN 1934,</i> <i> WHEN CRAZY HORSE'S</i> <i> YOUNGER SISTER</i> <i> DESCRIBED HIS APPEARANCE</i> <i> TO A FORENSIC ARTIST.</i> <i> THE LIKENESS TRIGGERED</i> <i> AN EMOTIONAL REACTION.</i> SHE CRIED, BECAUSE SHE SAID THAT'S THE CLOSEST LIKENESS THAT YOU WILL EVER HAVE OF HIM. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. WELL, HE CERTAINLY DOESN'T LOOK LIKE OUR PHOTOGRAPH. SO IT HAS THE TWO FEATHERS, THE LONG, FLOWING HAIR, AND A LITTLE BIT OF A SCAR. THAT'S THE CLOSEST WE'LL EVER GET OF OUR GRANDFATHER, THE WARRIOR, THE ONE THAT FOUGHT THE BATTLE OF LITTLE BIGHORN. <i> DOUG IS CONVINCED OUR IMAGE</i> <i> ISN'T CRAZY HORSE.</i> <i> BUT THIS SKETCH</i> <i> WAS MADE BY SOMEONE</i> <i> WHO NEVER MET CRAZAZY HORSE,</i> <i> SIX DECADES AFTER HE DIED.</i> <i> I'M TAKING THE IMAGE</i> <i> TO THE SMITHSONIAN,</i> <i> WHICH HOUSES</i> <i> THE WORLD'S LARGEST ARCHIVE</i> <i> OF NATIVE-AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHS.</i> <i> I WANT TO SHOW IT TO ONE</i> <i> OF THE SMITHSONIAN'S CURATORS.</i> <i> BUT FIRST,</i> <i> BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN</i> <i> MANY BOGUS</i> <i> CRAZY HORSE PICTURES,</i> <i> WHILE I'M HERE,</i> <i> I ALSO WANT TO SHOW IT</i> <i> TO STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER</i> <i> DON HURLBURT.</i> WELCOME TO THE DARKROOM. WOW. OKAY, SO HERE'S MY PIECE, AND ON THE BACK IT SAYS 1875. I WAS WONDERING IF YOU THOUGHT IT WAS PERIOD. IT DEFINITELY HAS CHARACTERISTICS FROM THAT TIME FRAME. IT'S YELLOWING, IT'S GOT A GOOD GOLD TONE TO IT. IT HAS THE SHININESS ON THE SURFACE OF THE PRINT THAT A MODERN PRINT WOULD NOT HAVE BUT PRINTS OF THAT AGE DO. HOW WOULD A PRINT LIKE THIS HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE 1870s? IT WAS DEFINITELY A MULTI-DAY, MULTI-STEP PROCESS TO MAKE ONE OF THESE PRINTS. THESE GUYS DID A LOT OF WORK TO GET THESE PHOTOGRAPHS. THESE PRINTS CAME FROM GLASS PLATE NEGATIVES THAT WERE MADE, PRODUCED FROM ABOUT THE 1850s TO 1880s. WELL, I CAN SHOW YOU. <i> THE INVENTION OF GLASS PLATES</i> <i> MEANT THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME,</i> <i> PHOTOGRAPHERS LIKE GARDNER</i> <i> HAD A PHOTOGRAPHIC MEDIUM</i> <i> FROM WHICH TO MAKE</i> <i> UNLIMITED NUMBERS OF PRINTS.</i> <i> GLASS PLATES REVOLUTIONIZED</i> <i> PHOTOGRAPHY.</i> NOW THAT I'VE CLEANED IT AND CHECKED IT, WE'RE GOING TO BRING IT OVER HERE, SET IT DOWN, GET A SHEET OF MODERN PAPER OUT, BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE ANY OF THE ALBUMEN PAPER WITH US ANYMORE. <i> DON SAYS GARDNER, OR WHOEVER</i> <i> TOOK THE PHOTOGRAPH,</i> <i> WOULD HAVE MADE</i> <i> ALBUMEN SILVER PRINTS,</i> <i> WHICH EXPOSED</i> <i> IN SUNLIGHT.</i> <i> TODAY, USING MODERN</i> <i> PHOTO PAPER,</i> <i> DEVELOPING A PRINT IN THE</i> <i> DARKROOM TAKES MERE MINUTES.</i> THAT'S GREAT. <i> I LEARN MORE ABOUT THE PRINT</i> <i> FROM FORMER ARCHIVIST</i> <i> AND SMITHSONIAN VOLUNTEER</i> <i> PAULA FLEMING.</i> <i> SHE SAYS THE IMAGE WAS ALMOST</i> <i> CERTAINLY TAKEN BY GARDNER</i> <i> NOT OUT WEST</i> <i> BUT ON THE EAST COAST</i> <i> AT THE ADDRESS</i> <i> ON THE BACK OF OUR PHOTOGRAPH.</i> HE HAD A STUDIO IN WASHINGTON, D.C., AND HE TOOK MOST OF HIS INDIAN PORTRAITS THERE. WELL, WHAT WOULD BRING THEM TO WASHINGTON, D.C.? AFTER THE CIVIL WAR, THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT RENEWED ITS EFFORTS TO DEAL WITH THE INDIANS TO RESOLVE ISSUES OF LAND ACQUISITION AND ANNUITIES. <i> PAULA SAYS HUNDREDS</i> <i> OF AMERICAN INDIANS</i> <i> WERE INVITED TO WASHINGTON</i> <i> AS TRIBAL DELEGATIONS.</i> THE GOVERNMENT WANTED TO SHOW THE INDIANS THE BENEFITS OF CIVILIZATION, SO THEY TOOK THEM ON TRAINS AND THEY TOOK THEM TO BIG CITIES TO SHOW THEM WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO BE CIVILIZED. <i> ON THE SURFACE,</i> <i> THE WASHINGTON VISITS</i> <i> WERE EFFORTS TO PEACEFULLY</i> <i> RESOLVE LAND DISPUTES</i> <i> AND DEMONSTRATE</i> <i> THAT THE INDIANS</i> <i> WERE BEING TREATED</i> <i> RESPECTFULLY,</i> <i> BUT PAULA SAYS THE VISITS</i> <i> OFTEN INCLUDED A STOP</i> <i> WHICH HAD A POLITICAL AGENDA.</i> THEY WOULD ALSO TAKE THEM TO THE ARSENAL AND THEY'D SHOW THEM STOCKPILES OF WEAPONS AND CANNONBALLS AND THEY WOULD HAVE DISPLAYS OF MILITARY MIGHT. THE GOVERNMENT WANTED TO SHOW THEM THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY FUTILE TO FIGHT FOR THEIR LANDS. THEY WERE GOING TO LOSE? THEY WERE GOING TO LOSE. <i> CRAZY HORSE'S GRANDSON</i> <i> HAD TOLD ME</i> <i> THAT THE CLOTHING</i> <i> AND DECORATION IN OUR IMAGE</i> <i> WAS NOT TYPICAL</i> <i> FOR THE WARRIOR.</i> <i> BUT PAULA SAYS NOT ALL THE</i> <i> PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN IN WASHINGTON</i> <i> WERE WHAT THEY APPEARED TO BE.</i> SOME PHOTOGRAPHERS ACTUALLY KEPT PROPS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INDIANS LOOKED EXOTIC ENOUGH, AND SOMETIMES THEY PUT THE IMPROPER COSTUMES ON THE WRONG CULTURES. <i> PAULA HAS A SURPRISE FOR ME.</i> WITH THOUSANDS OF PHOTOGRAPHS IN THE ARCHIVES, IT CAN BE A LITTLE DAUNTING IF YOU DON'T HAVE A NAME. BUT I DID A LITTLE BIT OF RESEARCH, AND COME HERE, I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU. WOW! <i> IT'S A GLASS PLATE NEGATIVE,</i> <i> JUST LIKE THE ONE</i> <i> DON SHOWED ME.</i> IT'S THE EXACT SAME IMAGE. SURE IS. THIS NEGATIVE WAS USED TO PRINT THAT IMAGE. IS IT CRAZY HORSE? <i> WHAT PAULA TELLS ME NEXT</i> <i> CLOSES THE CASE.</i> WELL, TIM, IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE INVESTIGATION. <i> I TELL HIM HE HAS AN AUTHENTIC</i> <i> ALEXANDER GARDNER PHOTO,</i> <i> ONE OF THE NATION'S</i> <i> MOST CELEBRATED</i> <i> PERIOD PHOTOGRAPHERS.</i> THERE ARE A LOT OF EXPERTS THAT DON'T BELIEVE THAT CRAZY HORSE WAS EVER PHOTOGRAPHED, AND THAT MADE IT REALLY DIFFICULT. FINALLY, THOUGH, I WAS ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE MAN IN YOUR PHOTOGRAPH BY TRAVELING TO WASHINGTON, D.C., JUST LIKE HE DID 150 YEARS AGO. THERE WAS AN ENGLISHMAN BY THE NAME OF WILLIAM HENRY BLACKMORE, AND HE COMMISSIONED GARDNER TO PHOTOGRAPH THE DELEGATIONS OF INDIANS. AND HE ALSO PUBLISHED THE IMAGES. THAT'S OUR GUY. THE MAN IN THE PHOTOGRAPH IS VUA-SHA-PEH, WHOSE ENGLISH NAME IS STABBER, AND HE WAS AN OGLALA LAKOTA WHO CAME TO WASHINGTON, D.C., WITH RED CLOUD ON A DELEGATION. <i> THE MAN IN THIS PHOTOGRAPHED</i> <i> HAD WITNESSED</i> <i> ONE OF THE LAST</i> <i> PEACEFUL NEGOTIATIONS</i> <i> BETWEEN THE LAKOTA</i> <i> AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT</i> <i> BEFORE GOLD WAS DISCOVERED</i> <i> IN THE BLACK HILLS.</i> HE WAS AN IMPORTANT PART OF LAKOTA HISTORY. I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT WE KNOW WHO HE IS NOW. <i> VUA-SHA-PEH HAD TRAVELED</i> <i> TO WASHINGTON</i> <i> WITH RED CLOUD</i> <i> AND THE LAKOTA DELEGATION.</i> <i> IN CONTRAST, CRAZY HORSE</i> <i> REJECTED DIPLOMACY</i> <i> AND DEFENDED LAKOTA TRADITIONS</i> <i> AS A WARRIOR TO THE END.</i> EXPERTS SAY THAT HE NEVER WENT TO WASHINGTON; HE STAYED ON HIS LAND TO FIGHT FOR HIS PEOPLE AND TO FIGHT THE U.S. MILITARY. I'M A GREAT ADMIRER OF CRAZY HORSE, AND I REALLY HOPED THAT THIS WAS HIM. WELL, I GUESS WE'LL NEVER KNOW WHAT CRAZY HORSE LOOKED LIKE. I HOPE THAT I CAN TAKE THE PHOTOGRAPH AND FIND HIS DESCENDANTS AND PASS THE PHOTOGRAPH DOWN TO THEM. WE THANK YOU FOR COMING ALL THE WAY OUT HERE TO GIVE US THE NEWS. <i> AFTER HIS VICTORY</i> <i> AT THE LITTLE BIGHORN,</i> <i> CRAZY HORSE FOUGHT ON</i> <i> UNTIL THE SPRING OF 1877.</i> <i> THEN, HIS PEOPLE WEAKENED</i> <i> BY WAR AND HUNGER,</i> <i> HE SURRENDERED</i> <i> AT CAMP ROBINSON, NEBRASKA.</i> <i> ON SEPTEMBER 5, 1877,</i> <i> HE WAS ARRESTED AND BROUGHT</i> <i> INTO THE GUARD HOUSE.</i> <i> REALIZING HE WAS</i> <i> ABOUT TO BE LOCKED UP,</i> <i> CRAZY HORSE STRUGGLED</i> <i> AND WAS STABBED</i> <i> BY A SOLDIER</i> <i> WITH A BAYONET.</i> <i> HE DIED LATE THAT NIGHT,</i> <i> AND SOON AFTER,</i> <i> HIS BODY WAS RETURNED</i> <i> TO HIS ELDERLY PARENTS.</i> <i> TO THIS DAY, HIS FINAL</i> <i> BURIAL PLACE IS UNKNOWN,</i> <i> BUT HIS SPIRIT LIVES ON</i> <i> IN THE BLACK HILLS.</i> REPATRIATION RAISES COMPLEX ISSUES ABOUT CULTURAL HERITAGE AND WHO OWNS IT. TODAY, LITERALLY MILLIONS OF AMERICAN INDIAN ARTIFACTS ARE HOUSED IN NON-NATIVE MUSEUMS AND PRIVATE COLLECTIONS. MANY OF THESE OBJECTS, LIKE TOOLS, WEAPONS, AND CLOTHES, WERE ACQUIRED THROUGH PERFECTLY LEGAL MEANS. OTHERS, HOWEVER, WERE BOUGHT FOR PENNIES OR STOLEN. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT SAW NOTHING WRONG WITH THIS, SINCE ITS OFFICIAL POSITION ON THE TRIBES WAS TO TRY TO ASSIMILATE THEM INTO THE MAINSTREAM. BUT NATIVE PEOPLES ARE STILL WITH US, AND SOME HAVE BEGUN TO ASK FOR -
- EVEN DEMAND -
- THEIR MOST IMPORTANT ARTIFACTS BACK. SO IN 1990, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT SIGNED INTO LAW THE NATIVE AMERICAN GRAVE PROTECTION AND REPATRIATION ACT, OR NAGPRA. NAGPRA REQUIRES FEDERALLY FUNDED ORGANIZATIONS TO RETURN SKELETONS AND OBJECTS OF CULTURAL PATRIMONY TO TRIBAL REPRESENTATIVES IF THEY FOLLOW THE CORRECT PROCEDURES. NAGPRA ONLY APPLIES TO FEDERALLY FUNDED ORGANIZATIONS. PRIVATE COLLECTIONS OR MUSEUMS ABROAD DON'T FALL UNDER ITS JURISDICTION. DESPITE THESE CHALLENGES, BOTH THE TRIBES AND MUSEUMS SEE NAGPRA AS A STEP FORWARD. Wes: <i> IN AN ENCORE PRESENTATION,</i> <i> OUR FINAL STORY TURNS THE PAGES</i> <i> OF A LONG-LOST DIARY</i> <i> FROM A WORLD WAR II</i> <i> BOMBER PILOT.</i> <i> DECEMBER 13, 1943:</i> <i> THE U.S. ARMY AIR FORCE</i> <i> 445th BOMB GROUP</i> <i> ATTACKS ENEMY SHIPYARDS</i> <i> BENEATH THE SKIES</i> <i> OF KIEL, GERMANY.</i> <i> IT'S THEIR FIRST</i> <i> OF 280 AIR-RAID MISSIONS</i> <i> INSIDE A NEW BOMBER</i> <i> CALLED THE B-24 LIBERATOR.</i> <i> THE BOMBER IS</i> <i> THE ALLIES' GREAT HOPE,</i> <i> FLYING FARTHER, LONGER,</i> <i> AND CARRYING MORE BOMBS</i> <i> DEEP INTO HITLER'S</i> <i> GERMANY.</i> <i> NOT A SINGLE PLANE IS LOST</i> <i> ON THIS MISSION,</i> <i> BUT THE 445th WILL RARELY</i> <i> BE SO LUCKY AGAIN.</i> <i> THE LIBERATOR EARNS ITSELF</i> <i> ANOTHER MORE OMINOUS NICKNAME:</i> <i> THE FLYING COFFIN,</i> <i> DUE TO THE HIGH CASUALTY RATE</i> <i> AMONG B-24 PILOTS.</i> <i> WHY WERE THESE MISSIONS</i> <i> SO DEADLY,</i> <i> AND WHAT CONVINCED THEIR CREW</i> <i> TO ACCEPT SUCH TERRIBLE ODDS?</i> <i> SIXTY YEARS AFTER THE LAST</i> <i> OF THOSE MISSIONS,</i> <i> JIM CHAPMAN</i> <i> OF LEXINGTON, NORTH CAROLINA,</i> <i> HAS A DIARY THAT MAY REVEAL</i> <i> NEW INFORMATION</i> <i> ABOUT THESE PLANES AND MEN</i> <i> WHO HELD HITLER AT BAY.</i> <i> I'M WES COWAN,</i> <i> AND I'M HEADING TO MEET JIM.</i> NICE TO MEET YOU. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THIS DIARY. MY DAD BROUGHT THIS HOME WITH HIM AFTER HE FINISHED HIS TOUR OF DUTY DURING WORLD WAR II. AND THE OBVIOUS QUESTION TO ME IS, IT'S NOT YOUR DAD'S DIARY. THAT'S CORRECT. THE DIARY BELONGED TO HIS CO-PILOT NAMED WILLIAM MORAN. BOTH SERVED ON A B-24. <i> BOTH MEN FLEW PLANES</i> <i> IN THE 445th BOMB GROUP</i> <i> STATIONED IN</i> <i> TIBENHAM, ENGLAND.</i> HOW DID YOUR DAD GET IT? WELL, THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. I ACTUALLY DISCOVERED THE DIARY IN A BOX OF MY FATHER'S MEMENTOS. <i> HE DISCOVERED IT AFTER</i> <i> HIS FATHER DIED 20 YEARS AGO.</i> CAN YOU READ ME SOME ENTRIES? YES, I'D BE GLAD TO. SURE DREADED GOING, ESPECIALLY AFTER I FOUND THE TARGET TO BE HAMBURG. FELT SURE I WOULDN'T GET BACK. AT LEAST I KNOW NOW THAT I'LL BE ABLE TO FACE DEATH WHEN MY TIME COMES. THE ONLY THING THAT I FEARED WAS LEAVING JAYNE. I ADORE HER EVERY BREATH. <i> MARY JAYNE</i> <i> WAS MORAN'S WIFE.</i> <i> IT'S THESE PERSONAL DETAILS</i> <i> IN THE DIARY THAT HAUNT JIM.</i> MAY 9, 1944. AN AIRMAIL LETTER FROM MY ANGEL. MY BABY IS PRETTY SURE SHE IS PREGNANT. THANK GOD! BOUGHT THE BOYS BEER WITH MY LAST SIX SHILLINGS TO CELEBRATE. THAT'S REALLY GREAT. <i> THERE'S SOMETHING IMPORTANT</i> <i> MISSING FROM THIS DIARY:</i> <i> AN ENDING.</i> <i> THE LAST ENTRY IS</i> <i> FROM OCTOBER 29th,</i> <i> SEVEN MONTHS BEFORE THE END</i> <i> OF THE WAR IN EUROPE.</i> WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU? WELL, WES, I'D LIKE TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO BILL MORAN, IF HE CAME BACK HOME OR IF HE WAS KILLED. I'D LIKE TO REALLY KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM. <i> JIM IS EAGER</i> <i> TO KNOW MORE ABOUT</i> <i> WHAT THE MEN HIS FATHER FLEW</i> <i> WITH SAW AND DID</i> <i> DURING THEIR TIME</i> <i> IN ENGLAND.</i> <i> AND HE WANTS HELP</i> <i> WITH ANOTHER QUESTION, TOO.</i> I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO REUNITE THE DIARY WITH BILL MORAN'S FAMILY. I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE FAMILY TO HAVE THIS. I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE THE DIARY WITH ME, AND I'M READY TO GET GOING. WELL, LET'S SEE. EVERY TIME I READ ONE OF THESE SOLDIER'S DIARIES, I JUST GET THE SENSE THAT I'M HOLDING A PIECE OF HISTORY IN MY HAND. <i> THE DIARY COVERS</i> <i> ABOUT A YEAR,</i> <i> FROM OCTOBER 1943</i> <i> TO OCTOBER 1944.</i> <i> MUCH OF IT</i> <i> IS WRITTEN MECHANICALLY,</i> <i> MORE LIKE A LOG</i> <i> THAN A PERSONAL JOURNAL.</i> <i> BUT IT'S CLEAR HIS UNIT IS</i> <i> IN THE THICK OF THE ACTION.</i> HERE'S ONE, SEPTEMBER 27th. STARTED A LETTER TO MY ANGEL, BUT BAHN STOPPED IN TO TELL ME OUR SQUAD LOST FOUR OUT OF NINE. IT WAS WITHEY'S LAST ONE. <i> A LOT OF BOMBERS WENT DOWN</i> <i> WITH MEN MORAN KNEW.</i> <i> IF HE'S SHAKEN BY THIS,</i> <i> I WOULDN'T KNOW IT</i> <i> FROM THE MATTER-OF-FACT</i> <i> LANGUAGE.</i> <i> AND HERE'S BILL MORAN'S</i> <i> LAST ENTRY,</i> <i> OCTOBER 29, 1944.</i> <i> MORE DEATH AND MORE</i> <i> MATTER-OF-FACT LANGUAGE.</i> BILL WRITES, MASS AND COMMUNION. PUT A COUPLE HOURS ON A SHIP. HEARD A ROTTEN GERMAN BROADCAST LATE LAST NIGHT CALLING EISENHOWER A RAT. <i> BUT THERE ARE NO CLUES</i> <i> WHY MORAN STOPPED WRITING.</i> <i> DID HE GO BACK HOME OR WAS</i> <i> HIS NEXT MISSION FATAL?</i> <i> THERE ARE PLENTY</i> <i> OF NAMES HERE.</i> <i> MAYBE SOMEONE BILL MORAN</i> <i> WROTE ABOUT IS STILL ALIVE</i> <i> AND CAN FILL IN</i> <i> THESE BLANK PAGES FOR ME.</i> LENNY, IT LOOKS LIKE. GOLDEN. CHAPPY, PELTON, AND I WERE LUCKY NOT TO GO. <i> I'LL CALL MY OFFICE AND ASK</i> <i> THEM TO TRY TO TRACK DOWN</i> <i> SOME OF BILL MORAN'S</i> <i> WAR BUDDIES.</i> WES COWAN. BILL OLDSON. GLAD TO MEET YOU, WES. <i> WHILE THEY'RE SEARCHING,</i> <i> I'VE COME TO FLORIDA</i> <i> TO MEET WITH PROFESSOR</i> <i> WILLIAM OLDSON</i> <i> FROM THE INSTITUTE</i> <i> ON WORLD WAR II</i> <i> AND THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE.</i> HERE'S THE DIARY THAT I SENT YOU THE TRANSCRIPT OF. OH, NICE. VERY UNUSUAL COVER. AND IF I MUST SAY, HIS HANDWRITING'S BETTER THAN MOST, TOO. <i> WILLIAM SAYS UNEARTHING</i> <i> JOURNALS FROM THE BATTLEFRONT</i> <i> IS ALWAYS</i> <i> AN IMPORTANT DISCOVERY,</i> <i> A UNIQUE WINDOW ON THE MEN</i> <i> WHO ACTUALLY DID THE FIGHTING.</i> IT'S THE UNVARNISHED TRUTH, AND IT'S THE YARDSTICK YOU CAN HOLD UP TO EVERYTHING ELSE -
- TO THE LETTERS HOME, TO THE PROPAGANDA, TO THE NEWSREEL -
- AND SAY, HERE'S WHAT HE FELT. <i> AND THERE CERTAINLY WAS</i> <i> A LOT TO WRITE ABOUT.</i> <i> WILLIAM EXPLAINS THAT</i> <i> IN 1943,</i> <i> ALLIED BOMBING RAIDS ON GERMANY</i> <i> ARE OFTEN INEFFECTUAL</i> <i> AT HITTING MILITARY</i> <i> AND INDUSTRIAL TARGETS.</i> <i> BUT BY 1944, WITH FORD CRANKING</i> <i> OUT A NEW B-24 EVERY HOUR,</i> <i> THE AMERICAN BOMBERS</i> <i> ARE SUCCESSFULLY TARGETING</i> <i> HITLER'S FACTORIES</i> <i> AND FUEL SUPPLIES</i> <i> AND HELPING TURN THE WAR</i> <i> IN THE ALLIES' FAVOR.</i> <i> BUT THE CARNAGE AMONG</i> <i> FLIGHT CREWS IS HORRENDOUS.</i> IN '43, WE LOST OVER 3,000 PLANES. '44, WE LOSE OVER 11,000 PLANES. <i> WILLIAM BELIEVES</i> <i> THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE</i> <i> MORAN WAS KILLED</i> <i> OVER GERMANY.</i> <i> FLYING DAYLIGHT RAIDS</i> <i> MADE THE BOMBERS EASY PREY</i> <i> FOR GERMAN FIGHTER PLANES</i> <i> AND ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUNS.</i> IF YOU WERE FLYING WITH BRITISH BOMBER COMMAND, YOU HAD A 65% CHANCE OF BEING A CASUALTY. IF YOU'RE FLYING IN THE AMERICAN 8th AIR FORCE, YOU'VE GOT A 40% TO 60% CHANCE OF BEING A CASUALTY. IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE IN THAT KAMIKAZE SQUADRON, YOU'VE ONLY GOT A 53% CHANCE OF BEING A CASUALTY. YOU'RE KIDDING ME. <i> WHILE LOGISTICS PROBLEMS</i> <i> OFTEN KEPT JAPANESE KAMIKAZE</i> <i> SQUADRONS GROUNDED,</i> <i> IN EUROPE,</i> <i> THE BIG ALLIED BOMBERS</i> <i> WERE SEEING COMBAT</i> <i> ALMOST DAILY.</i> SO A KAMIKAZE PILOT WHO'S SUPPOSED TO KILL HIMSELF STOOD A BETTER CHANCE OF SURVIVING THAN A B-24 BOMBER PILOT? HARD TO BELIEVE, ISN'T IT? <i> WILLIAM SAYS THE OFTEN REMOTE,</i> <i> MATTER-OF-FACT LANGUAGE</i> <i> IN SUCH WARTIME WRITING</i> <i> WAS A WAY OF WALLING OFF</i> <i> OR ESCAPING</i> <i> THE HORROR</i> <i> OF EVERYDAY LIFE.</i> I THINK IT'S NOT ONLY TYPICAL, IT'S NECESSARY. THEY CAN'T BROOD ABOUT IT. IT'S GOING TO INTERFERE WITH THEIR OWN PERFORMANCE, IT'S GOING TO DEPRESS THEM. <i> THE WRITING IS A FORM</i> <i> OF SELF-DEFENSE.</i> WHAT'S UNUSUAL ABOUT THE DIARY YOU HAVE IS THE ROMANTIC ASPECT OF IT. I DON'T KNOW ANY OTHER DIARY THAT I'VE SEEN WHERE SOMEBODY'S REFERRING TO HIS WIFE AS ANGEL. AND WE HAVE LOTS OF LETTERS WHERE IT SAYS, HELLO, HONEY, OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT, BUT NOT IN THE DIARIES. THANKS VERY MUCH FOR SHARING THIS WITH ME. THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME SEE THIS. THIS IS A VERY SPECIAL DOCUMENT. <i> I STILL DON'T KNOW</i> <i> EXACTLY WHY</i> <i> BILL MORAN STOPPED WRITING</i> <i> IN THE JOURNAL,</i> <i> BUT MY OFFICE</i> <i> HAS BEEN ABLE</i> <i> TO TRACK DOWN</i> <i> HIS MILITARY RECORDS,</i> <i> AND THEY'VE SENT THEM</i> <i> TO ME AT THE LIBRARY.</i> <i> IT'S SOBERING NEWS.</i> <i> ON OCTOBER 31, 1944,</i> <i> BILL MORAN WAS FLYING</i> <i> WITH PILOT EDWARD SPEERS</i> <i> AND SIX OTHER MEN</i> <i> WHEN THEIR PLANE DISAPPEARED.</i> THIS REPORT OF AIRCRAFT ACCIDENT OR MISSING AIRCRAFT REPORT CONFIRMS THAT MORAN WAS KILLED IN SOME SORT OF A TRAINING ACCIDENT. THEY'RE NOT CLEAR EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. HE TOOK OFF IN THE FORMATION. AFTER HE TOOK OFF, NOBODY ELSE IN THE AIRCRAFT FORMATION EVER SAW HIM AGAIN. <i> THE WRECKAGE AND MORAN'S BODY</i> <i> ARE NEVER FOUND.</i> THIS TOOK PLACE TWO DAYS AFTER THE LAST ENTRY IN HIS DIARY. <i> MARY JAYNE WAS SEVEN MONTHS</i> <i> PREGNANT WHEN BILL DIED.</i> <i> IF I'M GOING TO HELP JIM RETURN</i> <i> THE JOURNAL TO BILL'S FAMILY,</i> <i> I'M GOING TO NEED HELP</i> <i> TRACKING DOWN HIS DESCENDANTS.</i> <i> MY OFFICE HAS LOCATED</i> <i> JACK PELTON,</i> <i> ONE OF MORAN'S BUDDIES</i> <i> MENTIONED IN THE DIARY.</i> HEY, JACK. HEY, WES. <i> JACK AGREES TO MEET ME</i> <i> AT THE AMERICAN AERO SERVICES</i> <i> HANGAR IN FLORIDA,</i> <i> WHERE THE COLLINGS FOUNDATION</i> <i> MAINTAINS A B-24 BOMBER.</i> BOY, THIS IS QUITE A PIECE OF MACHINERY, ISN'T IT? OH, IT REALLY IS, IT'S A WONDERFUL AIRPLANE. AND YOU WERE A PILOT OF ONE OF THESE BIRDS. I WAS A PILOT, FLEW 32 MISSIONS. HOW'D YOU LIKE TO GET UP IN THE COCKPIT? LOVE TO. OH, WONDERFUL. <i> IT'S BEEN MORE THAN 50 YEARS</i> <i> SINCE JACK'S TAKEN A SEAT</i> <i> AT THE CONTROLS.</i> SO WHAT WAS IT LIKE TO FLY ONE OF THESE BABIES? IT WAS VERY EXCITING, REALLY. <i> JACK TELLS ME</i> <i> IN ORDER TO ATTACK</i> <i> HEAVILY DEFENDED TARGETS,</i> <i> PILOTS LIKE HE</i> <i> AND BILL MORAN FLEW</i> <i> AT ALTITUDES</i> <i> OVER 20,000 FEET,</i> <i> WHERE TEMPERATURES REACHED</i> <i> MINUS 30 DEGREES.</i> SO IT WAS COLD, YOU'RE WEARING AN OXYGEN MASK. THERE ARE NO HYDRAULICS IN THESE STEERING WHEELS. IT MUST HAVE BEEN A HELL OF A JOB. IT WAS A STRANGE FEELING. YOU WERE IN ANOTHER WORLD. <i> JACK EXPLAINS THAT</i> <i> THE LIGHTWEIGHT FRAME</i> <i> THAT MADE THE B-24</i> <i> SUCH AN EFFICIENT BOMBER</i> <i> ALSO MADE IT VULNERABLE</i> <i> TO ENEMY FIRE.</i> WE BROUGHT ONE PLANE HOME WITH 153 HOLES IN IT. [ machine gun firing ] <i> BULLETS AND SHELLS</i> <i> FROM GERMAN FIGHTER PLANES</i> <i> TORE THROUGH</i> <i> THE AMERICAN AIRCRAFT</i> <i> AND HELPED EARN THE B-24</i> <i> ITS REPUTATION</i> <i> AS A FLYING COFFIN.</i> YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT BILL MORAN'S DIARY HERE. WHAT KIND OF A GUY WAS BILL MORAN? WHAT WAS HE LIKE? BILL MORAN WAS A GREAT CO-PILOT, GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR, IRISHMAN ALL THE WAY. <i> JACK HAS A PICTURE</i> <i> OF BILL AND MARY JAYNE,</i> <i> BILL'S PREGNANT WIFE,</i> <i> TAKEN RIGHT BEFORE</i> <i> THE AIRMAN LEFT THE STATES.</i> SO THAT'S BILL. BILL. THAT'S MARY JAYNE. AND LOOK AT THEM HOLDING HANDS THERE. I'D RECOGNIZE YOU ANYWHERE. IT LOOKS LIKE YOU GUYS ARE HAVING A LOT OF FUN. YEAH, WE DID, HAD A GREAT EVENING. LAST TIME WE SAW OUR WIVES FOR A YEAR. ONE MORE QUESTION: WHERE WAS BILL MORAN FROM? PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA. MARY JAYNE WAS FROM THERE, TOO, THEN? YES, SHE WAS. WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO MARY JAYNE, DO YOU KNOW? I DON'T KNOW. I TRIED TO FIND HER WHEN I GOT BACK IN THE STATES, COULD NOT. ONE TIME WHEN I WAS ON BUSINESS IN PITTSBURGH, I HEARD SHE WAS THERE, BUT I STILL COULDN'T TRACK HER DOWN. <i> SO I'M BACK</i> <i> AT THE LIBRARY</i> <i> TO SEARCH THROUGH</i> <i> GENEALOGICAL RECORDS.</i> <i> AT FIRST, I DRAW A BLANK</i> <i> LOOKING FOR MARY JAYNE.</i> <i> MAYBE I CAN GET INFORMATION</i> <i> FROM ANOTHER FAMILY MEMBER.</i> <i> I FINALLY GET A BREAK</i> <i> WITH THE SOCIAL SECURITY</i> <i> DEATH INDEX</i> <i> FOR BILL'S MOTHER VERONICA.</i> BINGO, HERE SHE IS. SHE DIED IN MARCH 1967 IN MIAMI, FLORIDA. <i> HER OBITUARY</i> <i> EVENTUALLY LEADS US</i> <i> TO THE NAMES OF TWO</i> <i> OF BILL'S SURVIVING SISTERS:</i> <i> ADELAIDE YOUNG</i> <i> AND JEANIE KIMBROW</i> <i> OF SEBRING, FLORIDA.</i> <i> IF THERE'S A LOCAL LISTING,</i> <i> MAYBE WE'RE IN BUSINESS.</i> <i> IT TAKES A WHILE,</i> <i> BUT EVENTUALLY I GET LUCKY.</i> ADELAIDE YOUNG, THERE'S HER PHONE NUMBER, ADDRESS, BORN AUGUST 1930. IT'S GOT TO BE HER. I CAN'T BELIEVE I'VE FOUND A LIVING RELATIVE. HELLO, MRS. YOUNG? <i> ADELAIDE IS EXCITED</i> <i> BY NEWS OF THE DIARY,</i> <i> AND WE MAKE PLANS</i> <i> TO MEET.</i> YOU KNOW WHY I'VE COME TO SEE YOU. YES. I HAVE A DIARY THAT WAS WRITTEN BY YOUR BROTHER. OH, MY LIFE IN THE SERVICE. DO YOU RECOGNIZE THAT HANDWRITING? OH, OF COURSE. <i> IT'S THE CONSTANT REFERENCES</i> <i> TO BILL'S WIFE</i> <i> THAT CATCH ADELAIDE'S EYE.</i> HE ALWAYS SPEAKS OF HER IN SUCH A GENTLE WAY. YOU GET THE SENSE THAT THEY WERE REALLY IN LOVE. OH, FROM THE TIME THEY MET. <i> ADELAIDE WAS 14</i> <i> WHEN HER BROTHER DIED.</i> THE TELEGRAM WAS LAYING ON THE DINING ROOM TABLE, AND WE KEPT SAYING, THEY'LL FIND HIM, THEY'LL FIND HIM. SOMEDAY THEY'LL FIND HIM. THERE WAS NEVER ANY MEMORIAL SERVICE OR ANYTHING BECAUSE SOMEDAY THEY'LL FIND HIM. <i> AT FIRST THE VERY PREGNANT</i> <i> MARY JAYNE</i> <i> WASN'T EVEN TOLD</i> <i> HER HUSBAND WAS MISSING.</i> <i> SHE LEARNED BILL</i> <i> HAD BEEN KILLED</i> <i> FROM A FRIEND</i> <i> WHO VISITED HER</i> <i> RIGHT AFTER SHE'D GIVEN BIRTH</i> <i> TO THEIR DAUGHTER.</i> SHE WAS INCONSOLABLE. SHE WAS JUST UNBELIEVABLY IN GRIEF. <i> MARY JAYNE DIED ROUGHLY</i> <i> 20 YEARS AFTER HER HUSBAND,</i> <i> BUT WHAT ADELAIDE</i> <i> REVEALED NEXT</i> <i> WILL BE EXTRAORDINARY NEWS</i> <i> FOR JIM.</i> THIS HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE STORY FOR ME. <i> I TELL JIM ABOUT SOME OF</i> <i> THE THINGS I'VE LEARNED</i> <i> WHILE WORKING</i> <i> ON BILL'S DIARY.</i> I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, THOUGH, THAT I HAVE SOME BAD NEWS. <i> I LET JIM KNOW THAT BILL MORAN</i> <i> DIED IN A TRAINING MISSION</i> <i> AND HIS WIFE PASSED AWAY</i> <i> OVER 40 YEARS AGO,</i> <i> BUT THE STORY</i> <i> DOESN'T END THERE.</i> THERE'S SOMEONE I DO WANT YOU TO MEET, SO IF YOU WANT TO FOLLOW ME, WE'LL GO MEET THAT PERSON. I'D LIKE TO DO THAT. <i> ADELAIDE TOLD ME</i> <i> THAT THE BABY</i> <i> THAT BILL WAS</i> <i> SO EAGERLY EXPECTING</i> <i> WAS BORN 32 DAYS</i> <i> AFTER HE DIED.</i> <i> HER NAME WAS JANIE.</i> SHE'S MARRIED. SHE HAS TWO CHILDREN AND FOUR GRANDCHILDREN. <i> BILL MORAN WOULD HAVE BEEN</i> <i> A GREAT-GRANDFATHER.</i> HEY, GUYS. HI. I WANT YOU TO MEET SOMEBODY, JIM. THIS IS JIM CHAPMAN. THIS IS CHAPPY'S SON. HI, HOW ARE YOU? THIS IS ADELAIDE YOUNG. THIS IS BILL'S SISTER. I REMEMBER HIM TALKING ABOUT -
- OH, HI, ADELAIDE. HE TALKED ABOUT BILL CHAPMAN ALL THE TIME. OH, IT'S SO NICE TO MEET YOU. OH, I'M SO GLAD TO MEET YOU. AND THIS IS BILL'S DAUGHTER, JANIE. HI, JIM, IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU. THANK YOU FOR TAKING CARE OF THE JOURNAL. I'M SO GLAD TO HAVE FOUND YOU. <i> THANKS TO JIM,</i> <i> BILL MORAN'S THOUGHTS</i> <i> ARE NOW FINALLY GOING HOME</i> <i> TO THE DAUGHTER</i> <i> HE NEVER KNEW.</i> I JUST FEEL LIKE I KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT YOU ALREADY. [ clears throat ] EXCUSE ME. SORRY. THE DIARY'S BEEN IN OUR FAMILY FOR 63 YEARS. WHAT WAS SO FASCINATING WAS READING IN THE DIARY ABOUT YOUR MOTHER CARRYING YOU AND YOUR DAD BEING SO HAPPY AND EXCITED ABOUT YOUR MOM BEING PREGNANT. IN THE DIARY ITSELF, IT JUST COMES THROUGH THAT HE LOVES YOUR MOTHER VERY MUCH. <i> MORAN AND HIS FELLOW PILOTS</i> <i> HAD HELPED DEAL HITLER'S</i> <i> WAR MACHINE A CRIPPLING BLOW,</i> <i> AND THEIR CHILDREN</i> <i> AND CHILDREN'S CHILDREN</i> <i> WOULD LIVE IN A WORLD</i> <i> THEY HAD TRANSFORMED.</i> THIS IS A GLIMPSE INTO YOUR FATHER'S LIFE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, JIM, FOR TREASURING IT AND TAKING CARE OF IT FOR ALL THOSE YEARS. TO HEAR MORE ABOUT JACK PELTON'S EXPERIENCES AS A WORLD WAR II BOMBER PILOT, VISIT<i> HISTORY DETECTIVES</i> ON THE WEB AT pbs.org. Tukufu: BILL MORAN ALSO WROTE IN HIS DIARY ABOUT THE KASSEL MISSION. IT'S THE BIGGEST SINGLE LOSS FOR AN AMERICAN BOMBER GROUP IN THE COUNTRY'S MILITARY HISTORY. WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 1944. BAHN STOPPED IN TO TELL ME THAT WE LOST 22 OUT OF 35 SHIPS. WITHEY, GOLDEN, BOECHER, ROBINSON, AND REYNOLDS DIDN'T GET BACK. JACK PELTON REMEMBERS THAT DAY WELL. THEY CALLED ME FOR THAT MISSION AND I HAD A PASS TO GO TO LONDON. AND I SHOWED THE SERGEANT MY PASS, AND HE SAID, OKAY, TOOK THE GUY IN THE NEXT BUNK, AND HE NEVER CAME HOME. THIRTY-NINE PLANES FROM THE 445th BOMB GROUP SET OUT TO ATTACK A TANK FACTORY IN KASSEL, GERMANY. BUT THE LEAD PLANE MAKES A WRONG TURN, AND THE 445th GETS SEPARATED FROM THE REST OF THE COMBAT WING. ALONE OVER ENEMY TERRITORY, THE LIBERATORS ARE AMBUSHED BY OVER 100 GERMAN FIGHTERS. IN LESS THAN FOUR MINUTES, 116 AMERICAN PILOTS ARE DEAD. SURVIVORS RETURNING TO BASE RECOUNT THE HORROR. THE AIR WAS FILLED WITH BOMBERS BLOWING UP AND FALLING BOMBER PARTS, PARACHUTES, AND BODIES, AND BODY PARTS. IT WAS A REAL HOLOCAUST. SOME OF THE GUYS CAME BACK, THEY WERE ALMOST HYSTERICAL. THEY COULD HARDLY CONTAIN THEMSELVES. THOUGH THE LOSS IS TRAGIC, THE WAR GOES ON. THE NEXT DAY, THE MILITARY SENDS ANOTHER BOMBER GROUP BACK TO KASSEL TO FINISH THE JOB. ALL OF THOSE PLANES RETURNED SAFELY.

VALENTINE'S DAY:</i> <i> GANGSTERS TURN A DAY</i> <i> OF LOVE AND REFLECTION</i> <i> INTO A BLOODBATH,</i> <i> EXECUTING SEVEN MEN</i> <i> IN A CHICAGO GARAGE.</i> [ machine gun firing ] <i> AUTHORITIES SUSPECT THE HAND</i> <i> OF POWERFUL GANGSTER AL CAPONE,</i> <i> WHO WAS FIGHTING TO CONTROL THE</i> <i> CITY'S ILLEGAL LIQUOR TRADE.</i> <i> THE DAYLIGHT KILLING</i> <i> OUTRAGES THE NATION</i> <i> AND BECOMES A SYMBOL</i> <i> OF THE FAILURE OF PROHIBITION.</i> <i> HOWEVER, NO ONE IS EVER</i> <i> CONVICTED OF THE KILLING</i> <i> AND THE CRIME</i> <i> REMAINS UNSOLVED.</i> <i> NOW MIKE LUX</i> <i> OF LAKE GENEVA, WISCONSIN,</i> <i> BELIEVES HE HAS</i> <i> THE MISSING WEAPON</i> <i> FROM THIS LEGENDARY</i> <i> GANGLAND MASSACRE.</i> THIS GUN MAY HAVE TAKEN THE LIVES OF TWO MEN. <i> I'M ON MY WAY TO MEET MIKE</i> <i> AND LOOK INTO HIS STORY. </i> VERY NICE TO MEET YOU. OH, WOW! 12-GAUGE SHOTGUN. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT IT. AND WHAT'S THE STORY BEHIND IT? IT WAS SUPPOSEDLY USED IN THE ST. VALENTINE'S DAY MASSACRE. THAT WAS IN CHICAGO IN 1929. YES. YOU KNOW, JUST BY LOOKING AT THE GUN, TO ME IT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE THE BARREL IS NOT PERIOD TO THE PIECE. CORRECT. I HAD THIS BARREL PUT ON TO MAKE IT LEGAL. ORIGINALLY THE BARREL WAS CUT OFF PROBABLY ABOUT RIGHT HERE. AND I ACTUALLY HAVE A COUPLE PICTURES OF IT. OH, AND I CAN SEE THE BARREL'S MUCH SHORTER. <i> MIKE TELLS ME THAT</i> <i> SHORT-BARREL SHOTGUNS</i> <i> ARE FEDERALLY REGULATED</i> <i> AND THAT HE PUT A LONGER BARREL</i> <i> ON THE GUN</i> <i> TO COMPLY WITH THESE RULES.</i> HOW'D YOU GET THE GUN? I HAD INHERITED IT FROM MY FATHER WHEN HE PASSED AWAY. <i> MIKE SAYS HIS FATHER</i> <i> GOT THE GUN</i> <i> FROM A FORMER CHICAGO FIRE</i> <i> COMMISSIONER, ROBERT QUINN.</i> <i> MIKE BELIEVES THAT QUINN,</i> <i> WHO IS NOW DECEASED,</i> <i> MAY HAVE USED HIS INFLUENCE</i> <i> TO SECRETLY ACQUIRE THE GUN. </i> I THINK WHEN QUINN ACQUIRED IT, IT HAD TO HAVE BEEN IN THE MID-'70s. <i> MIKE'S FATHER WAS KILLED</i> <i> IN AN AIR CRASH IN 1979.</i> TWO DAYS LATER, ONE OF HIS FRIENDS TALKED TO ME, AND HE WAS VERY UPSET ABOUT THE PLANE CRASH, BUT HE WAS ALSO VERY WORRIED THAT NOW I OWN THIS PIECE AND HE DIDN'T WANT ME TO BE SHOWING IT OFF OR TELLING ANYBODY ABOUT IT, AND I HAVEN'T. THAT'S WHY I'VE HAD IT FOR 30 YEARS HIDDEN AWAY. WHAT'D YOU THINK WHEN YOUR DAD TOLD YOU THAT THIS WAS USED IN THE ST. VALENTINE'S DAY MASSACRE? I THOUGHT, COME ON, YOU'RE PULLING MY LEG. AND HE WAS DEAD SERIOUS. AND HE WAS A SERIOUS KIND OF GUY. WHEN IT CAME TO WEAPONS LIKE THIS IN HIS COLLECTION, HE WAS NOT FOOLING. MIKE, WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU WANT TO KNOW? IF IT TRULY IS THE SHOTGUN THAT WAS USED AT THE ST. VALENTINE'S DAY MASSACRE. I WILL SEE WHAT I CAN FIND OUT. DO YOU MIND IF I SIT HERE FOR A WHILE AND EVALUATE IT? ABSOLUTELY NOT. I USED TO WORK IN THE GUN DEPARTMENT AT CHRISTIE'S, SO I KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT GUNS. AND THE FIRST THING I NEED TO DETERMINE WAS IF THIS GUN WAS EVEN AROUND IN 1929. WAS IT PERIOD TO THE TIME OF THE MASSACRE? <i> IT CERTAINLY APPEARS TO BE.</i> <i> THE WOODEN FORESTOCK</i> <i> IS FOR A REPEATING,</i> <i> OR PUMP-ACTION,</i> <i> SHOTGUN.</i> <i> THAT MEANS IT CAN FIRE</i> <i> MULTIPLE SHOTS</i> <i> WITHOUT RELOADING.</i> I KNOW THAT THERE IS A SERIAL NUMBER HERE. AH, HERE IT IS: 18514 B. <i> THAT MAY HELP US</i> <i> MORE PRECISELY DATE THE GUN,</i> <i> ALTHOUGH BACK THEN</i> <i> I'M PRETTY CERTAIN A PURCHASER</i> <i> WAS NOT REQUIRED</i> <i> TO REGISTER THEIR WEAPON.</i> I SEE THAT IT SAYS WESTERN FIELD ON THE PLATE. YOU KNOW, I DID NOTICE SOMETHING UNUSUAL OVER HERE ON THE STOCK. THERE ARE TWO NOTCHES. MAYBE WE COULD GET SOME INFORMATION FROM THAT AS WELL. <i> IF THIS GUN REALLY WAS USED</i> <i> IN THE ST. VALENTINE'S DAY</i> <i> MASSACRE,</i> <i> THEN IT'S AN EXCEPTIONAL PIECE</i> <i> OF HISTORY</i> <i> AND ITS COLLECTION VALUE</i> <i> WOULD BE VERY HIGH.</i> <i> ON THE MORNING</i> <i> OF FEBRUARY 14, 1929,</i> <i> SEVEN IMMACULATELY DRESSED MEN</i> <i> GATHERED IN A GARAGE</i> <i> ON CHICAGO'S NORTH SIDE.</i> <i> SOME WERE MEMBERS</i> <i> OF A GANG</i> <i> LED BY THE NOTORIOUS BOOTLEGGER</i> <i> BUGS MORAN.</i> <i> WITHOUT WARNING,</i> <i> GUNMEN STORMED IN</i> <i> AND UNLEASHED A HAIL OF BULLETS</i> <i> THAT LEFT ALL SEVEN DEAD.</i> <i> WITNESSES REPORTED SEEING</i> <i> WHAT LOOKED LIKE TWO POLICE</i> <i> OFFICERS LEAVE THE GARAGE.</i> <i> THE MID-MORNING SLAUGHTER</i> <i> TURNED THE MEDIA SPOTLIGHT</i> <i> ON THE CITY OF CHICAGO AND THE</i> <i> VIOLENT STRUGGLE BEING WAGED</i> <i> OVER CONTROL</i> <i> OF THE ILLEGAL LIQUOR TRADE.</i> <i> I'M IN CHICAGO TO MEET</i> <i> THE AUTHOR OF THIS BOOK,</i> <i> ART BILEK.</i> HI, ART. HERE IS THE GUN. TELL ME YOUR OPINION ON THAT. WHAT DO I HAVE HERE? IT'S A 12-GAUGE SHOTGUN... <i> ART IS ALSO</i> <i> A FORMER POLICE OFFICER</i> <i> AND FAMILIAR WITH THE WEAPONS</i> <i> OF CHOICE OF CRIMINALS.</i> MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT HAS A SAWED-OFF STOCK. GANGSTERS IN THE 1920s HAD THESE STOCKS MODIFIED SO THAT THEY COULD CARRY THESE UNDER THEIR OVERCOATS LIKE THIS. SO IT'S A GANGSTER GUN? OH, YES. IN FACT, THAT'S THE WAY I WOULD REFER TO IT, AS A GANGSTER GUN. <i> ART SAYS EXACTLY HOW</i> <i> THE VICTIMS</i> <i> WERE LURED TO THEIR DEATH</i> <i> WAS NEVER ESTABLISHED.</i> <i> INVESTIGATORS SUSPECTED</i> <i> THE PHONY POLICEMEN</i> <i> WERE AL CAPONE GANG MEMBERS.</i> <i> WHEN THEY ORDERED</i> <i> THE RIVAL GANGSTERS</i> <i> TO LINE UP AND TURN AROUND,</i> <i> MORE CAPONE MEN ENTERED,</i> <i> CARRYING WEAPONS.</i> WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WENT ON EXCEPT TWO OF THE MEN PULLED OUT THOMPSON SUBMACHINE GUNS AND BEGAN RIDDLING THE BACK OF THESE SEVEN MEN WITH MACHINE GUN BULLETS. <i> GETTING INFORMATION ABOUT THE</i> <i> CRIME WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE.</i> <i> THE CHICAGO UNDERWORLD</i> <i> WAS RULED BY FEAR.</i> <i> BEFORE DYING, ONE OF</i> <i> THE VICTIMS, FRANK GUSENBERG,</i> <i> TOLD INCREDULOUS POLICE,</i> <i> NOBODY SHOT ME.</i> <i> INVESTIGATORS TURNED</i> <i> TO EVIDENCE</i> <i> FROM THE BLOOD-DRENCHED GARAGE.</i> SERGEANT JAMES LOFTUS, WHO WAS THE FIRST OFFICER ON THE SCENE, WAS ABLE TO COLLECT FROM THE SCENE SEVERAL ITEMS. HERE IS A COPY OF THE INVENTORY REPORT THAT HE FILED THAT VERY DAY. <i> THERE WERE SEVERAL .45-CALIBER</i> <i> SHELLS AND BULLETS,</i> <i> THE SIZE OF AMMUNITION USED</i> <i> IN THE TOMMY GUN.</i> <i> ART POINTS OUT SOMETHING</i> <i> OF PARTICULAR INTEREST.</i> AND THERE IS THE ITEM RIGHT THERE: TWO SHOTGUN SHELLS, 12-GAUGE. <i> THAT'S THE SAME GAUGE</i> <i> AS MIKE'S GUN.</i> <i> I TELL ART THAT MIKE BELIEVES</i> <i> HIS WEAPON ONCE BELONGED</i> <i> TO ROBERT QUINN, A FORMER</i> <i> CHICAGO FIRE COMMISSIONER</i> <i> IN THE 1950s</i> <i> THROUGH THE 1970s.</i> HE WAS ONE OF THE MORE NOTABLE FIRE COMMISSIONERS IN THE HISTORY OF CHICAGO. <i> HE SAYS QUINN WAS PART OF AN</i> <i> INNER CIRCLE AROUND THE MAYOR</i> <i> IN A PERIOD</i> <i> WHEN CONTROL OF EVIDENCE,</i> <i> ESPECIALLY FOR</i> <i> A CELEBRATED COLD CASE,</i> <i> WAS NOT NEARLY</i> <i> AS TIGHTLY HELD AS TODAY.</i> DO YOU THINK THAT HE COULD HAVE OWNED THIS GUN? HE KNEW ALL OF THE TOP OFFICIALS. HE WOULD HAVE KNOWN THE CORONER VERY WELL. AND HE WOULD HAVE KNOWN OTHER PEOPLE IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER HE MIGHT HAVE MET A MAN THAT HAD POSSESSION OF THIS GUN. <i> ART SAYS THE DESCRIPTION</i> <i> OF TWO OF THE KILLERS</i> <i> DRESSED IN POLICE UNIFORMS</i> <i> TURNED UP THE HEAT</i> <i> ON INVESTIGATORS,</i> <i> BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL TEN MONTHS</i> <i> LATER THAT THEY CAUGHT A BREAK:</i> <i> AN AL CAPONE ASSOCIATE</i> <i> NAMED FRED KILLER BURKE</i> <i> WAS INVOLVED IN A FENDER BENDER</i> <i> ACROSS STATE LINES IN MICHIGAN.</i> WELL, THERE WAS A POLICE OFFICER ON THE NEXT CORNER, AND HE BEGAN WALKING DOWN. WITH THAT, KILLER BURKE DRIVES OFF, THE POLICEMAN JUMPS ON THE RUNNING BOARD, BURKE TAKES OUT HIS GUN AND SHOOTS HIM. THE OFFICER TUMBLES TO THE GROUND DEAD. A HUGE MANHUNT FOLLOWS, AND THAT'S HOW THEY FOUND BURKE'S CAR OVERTURNED WHERE HE TRIED TO MAKE A TURN IN THE ROAD AND FAILED. <i> ART EXPLAINS THAT BURKE WAS</i> <i> A CAREER GANGSTER AND HIT MAN.</i> <i> A WORLD WAR I VET, HE WAS</i> <i> SUSPECTED OF INTRODUCING</i> <i> THE THOMPSON SUBMACHINE GUN</i> <i> TO THE DETROIT MOB,</i> <i> HELPING MURDER THREE MEN</i> <i> IN 1927.</i> <i> IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE</i> <i> ST. VALENTINE'S DAY KILLINGS,</i> <i> BURKE WAS HOLED UP</i> <i> IN A SMALL MICHIGAN TOWN.</i> <i> AFTER KILLING THE OFFICER,</i> <i> POLICE RAIDED HIS HIDEOUT.</i> AND UPSTAIRS ON THE SECOND FLOOR, THEY OPENED A CLOSET AND THERE WERE THE TWO MACHINE GUNS, A SHOTGUN, AND SOME OTHER ARMORY-TYPE DEVICES. <i> FORENSIC ANALYSIS</i> <i> WOULD LATER CONNECT</i> <i> SOME OF FRED BURKE'S WEAPONS</i> <i> TO THE MASSACRE.</i> WHERE ARE THOSE GUNS NOW? THE GUNS AT THE CURRENT TIME ARE BEING HELD BY THE BERRIEN COUNTY, MICHIGAN, SHERIFF'S OFFICE, WHERE THEY WERE RECOVERED IN THE FIRST PLACE. <i> I'M IN BERRIEN COUNTY TO MEET</i> <i> WITH LIEUTENANT KEITH HAFER,</i> <i> THE WEAPONS EXPERT IN CHARGE</i> <i> OF THE MASSACRE GUNS.</i> WOW. THESE ARE THE TWO THOMPSON SUBMACHINE GUNS USED IN THE ST. VALENTINE'S DAY MASSACRE. <i> LIEUTENANT HAFER EXPLAINS</i> <i> THAT FOR YEARS,</i> <i> THE GUNS WERE HELD</i> <i> BY THE FBI</i> <i> AT THEIR BALLISTICS CRIME LAB</i> <i> IN QUANTICO, VIRGINIA.</i> <i> IN THE LATE 1970s, A MICHIGAN</i> <i> DETECTIVE TRAINING WITH THE FBI</i> <i> SPOTTED THE GUNS</i> <i> AND ASKED FOR THEIR RETURN.</i> ARE THESE THE ONLY GUNS THAT YOU HAVE? THERE WERE OTHER GUNS SEIZED FROM FRED BURKE'S HOME, BUT THOSE GUNS ARE LONG GONE AND I HAVE NO RECORD OF THEM. WELL, I'M INVESTIGATING THIS SHOTGUN THAT I BELIEVE MAY HAVE BEEN USED AT THE MASSACRE. IT'S CERTAINLY THE RIGHT AGE AND IT LOOKS LIKE A GANGSTER GUN. WHAT I NOTICE IMMEDIATELY ARE THESE TWO NOTCHES CUT INTO THE PISTOL GRIP OF THIS SHOTGUN. <i> LIEUTENANT HAFER SAYS</i> <i> CRIMINALS SOMETIMES CARVED</i> <i> NOTCHES ON THEIR WEAPONS</i> <i> WHEN THEY KILLED A MAN.</i> AND THE THOMPSONS THAT WE HAVE HAVE NOTCHES CARVED INTO THE TRIGGER GUARDS. <i> HE'S NOT SURE</i> <i> IF THE MARKINGS</i> <i> CAN CONNECT OUR GUN</i> <i> TO THE MASSACRE,</i> <i> BUT OFFERS TO TAKE ME</i> <i> TO THE FIRING RANGE</i> <i> TO SHOW EXACTLY WHY OUR GUN</i> <i> AND THE TOMMY GUN</i> <i> WOULD HAVE BEEN FAVORITE</i> <i> GANGSTER WEAPONS.</i> FIRE! HIT HIM RIGHT IN THE CHEST, KEEP GOING. <i> THE TOMMY GUN</i> <i> CAN FIRE CONTINUOUSLY.</i> <i> LIEUTENANT HAFER HAS TOLD ME TO</i> <i> FIRE JUST THREE SHOTS AT A TIME</i> <i> BECAUSE THE WEAPON</i> <i> IS DIFFICULT TO CONTROL.</i> IT'S PRETTY POWERFUL. <i> LIEUTENANT HAFER SAYS</i> <i> THIS MODEL TOMMY GUN</i> <i> COULD UNLOAD A DEVASTATING</i> <i> 700 ROUNDS A MINUTE.</i> I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY A GANGSTER LIKES THAT GUN. IT WAS THE HIGH-TECH WEAPON OF ITS DAY. <i> HE TELLS ME THAT BEFORE THE</i> <i> INTRODUCTION OF THE TOMMY GUN</i> <i> TO THE CHICAGO CRIME WORLD</i> <i> IN 1924,</i> <i> THE REPEATING SHOTGUN WAS</i> <i> THE GANGSTER GUN OF CHOICE. </i> WHAT YOU HAVE HERE IS A PUMP-ACTION REPEATING SHOTGUN, WHICH WAS A VERY COMMON AND DEVASTATING WEAPON OF THE TIME. <i> OUR GUN IS CAPABLE OF FIRING</i> <i> SIX SHOTS BEFORE RELOADING,</i> <i> UNLEASHING A DEVASTATING SPRAY</i> <i> OF SHOTGUN PELLETS.</i> WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHOOT IT? YEAH, DEFINITELY. PULL IT IN TIGHT, YEP. AIM AT YOUR TARGET AND SHOOT WHEN READY. [ gunshots and reloading ] WOW, THAT'S GOT QUITE A KICK TO IT. WHY DON'T YOU OPEN THE BOLT AND LET'S MAKE SURE IT'S EMPTY. OKAY. NOW, DO YOU THINK THAT THIS GUN WAS USED IN THE ST. VALENTINE MASSACRE? IT'S CERTAINLY A POSSIBILITY. <i> LIEUTENANT HAFER SUGGESTS</i> <i> I PICK UP THE SHELL CASINGS.</i> <i> IF OUR GUN WAS USED</i> <i> IN THE MASSACRE,</i> <i> THE SHELLS MAY BEAR</i> <i> USEFUL FORENSIC INFORMATION.</i> <i> HE'S NOT SURE WHAT REMAINS</i> <i> IN THE OLD POLICE FILES</i> <i> BUT SUGGESTS I SPEAK WITH</i> <i> POLICE HISTORIAN CHRISS LYON</i> <i> AT THE HERITAGE MUSEUM AND</i> <i> CULTURAL CENTER IN ST. JOSEPH.</i> HI, CHRISS. HI, ELYSE. GREAT TO MEET YOU, WELCOME TO ST. JOSEPH, MICHIGAN. THANK YOU. <i> CHRISS SAYS THE POLICE FOUND A</i> <i> TROVE OF INCRIMINATING EVIDENCE</i> <i> WHEN THEY RAIDED</i> <i> FRED BURKE'S HIDEOUT.</i> THIS ONE IS ONE OF THE ORIGINAL PHOTOS OF SOME OF THE WEAPONRY THAT WAS FOUND IN FRED BURKE'S HOUSE. OKAY, SO I SEE HERE THE TWO TOMMY GUNS THAT WERE FOUND IN HIS HOUSE. AND THIS IS ALL THE ARSENAL. AND THIS MUST BE THE SHOTGUN. <i> CHRISS EXPLAINS HOW THE CHICAGO</i> <i> AUTHORITIES HAD TURNED</i> <i> TO A FORENSICS EXPERT</i> <i> NAMED CALVIN GODDARD</i> <i> TO EXAMINE THE BURKE WEAPONS.</i> WHEN GODDARD TOOK THESE GUNS TO BE TESTED BALLISTICALLY, HE TOOK THE TOMMY GUNS AND HE TOOK THIS GUN, WHICH IS A 20-GAUGE. NOW, WE KNOW THAT THERE WAS A 12-GAUGE USED IN THE ST. VALENTINE'S DAY MASSACRE BY THE SHELLS THAT WERE FOUND. SO IF THIS GUN WASN'T USED IN THE MASSACRE, THEN IT'S STILL POSSIBLE THAT OUR GUN WAS. <i> I'M CURIOUS, HAD GODDARD ALSO</i> <i> EXAMINED THE 12-GAUGE SHELLS</i> <i> FOUND AT THE CRIME SCENE</i> <i> AFTER THE MASSACRE?</i> <i> CHRISS SUGGESTS</i> <i> I SPEAK WITH</i> <i> FORMER CRIME LAB DIRECTOR</i> <i> PAUL DOUGHERTY,</i> <i> WHO HAS STUDIED THE MASSACRE</i> <i> AND THE SUBSEQUENT</i> <i> POLICE DETECTIVE WORK.</i> OKAY, SO HERE'S THE GUN I TALKED TO YOU ABOUT. YES. WHAT DO YOU THINK? THIS IS A WESTERN FIELD, WHICH IS MADE BY STEVENS. IT HAS A FAIRLY LOW SERIAL NUMBER, WHICH INDICATES IT'S FAIRLY OLD. <i> PAUL SAYS THE MODEL WAS IN</i> <i> PRODUCTION FROM 1905 TO 1932</i> <i> AND PERIOD TO THE MASSACRE.</i> <i> HOWEVER, HE CAN'T PRECISELY</i> <i> DATE THE GUN</i> <i> BECAUSE THE MANUFACTURER'S</i> <i> SERIAL RECORDS</i> <i> HAVE BEEN DESTROYED.</i> SO TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT GODDARD. WELL, CALVIN GODDARD WAS A FIRST-CLASS SCIENTIST AND HE APPROACHED EVERYTHING THAT HE DID AS A SCIENTIST. <i> PAUL SAYS GODDARD TRAINED</i> <i> AS A PHYSICIAN,</i> <i> BUT IN 1926, ENTERED</i> <i> THE EMERGING FIELD</i> <i> OF BALLISTIC SCIENCE.</i> <i> HIS FORENSIC WORK,</i> <i> WHICH HELPED CONVICT</i> <i> ANARCHIST NICOLA SACCO</i> <i> IN THE CELEBRATED SACCO</i> <i> AND VANZETTI MURDER CASE,</i> <i> CAUGHT THE ATTENTION</i> <i> OF THE CHICAGO CORONER.</i> IT WAS THE ENORMITY OF THE ST. VALENTINE'S DAY MASSACRE THAT BROUGHT THE NEED FOR SCIENTIFIC CRIME DETECTION TO THE PUBLIC ATTENTION AND TO THE ATTENTION OF AUTHORITIES OF CHICAGO. <i> GODDARD TEST-FIRED</i> <i> THE BURKE RAID TOMMY GUNS</i> <i> AND COMPARED THE SHELLS</i> <i> TO THOSE</i> <i> FROM THE SCENE OF THE CRIME.</i> <i> HE EXPLAINED TO</i> <i> THE CHICAGO INVESTIGATORS</i> <i> HOW SPENT SHELLS HAD</i> <i> THEIR OWN IDENTIFYING MARKS.</i> HE WOULD PUT THE CARTRIDGE CASES UNDER THE COMPARISON MICROSCOPE, ONE ON EITHER SIDE. THEN HE COMPARED THEM THROUGH THE EYEPIECE, WHICH IS HERE. SO, PAUL, TELL ME WHAT I'M LOOKING AT. <i> USING A REPLICA</i> <i> OF GODDARD'S MICROSCOPE,</i> <i> PAUL TELLS ME TO COMPARE</i> <i> THE IMPRESSIONS ON TWO SHELLS</i> <i> FROM GODDARD'S</i> <i> PERSONAL COLLECTION.</i> SO THE FIRING PIN IMPRESSIONS ARE THE SAME. <i> BY MATCHING</i> <i> FIRING PIN IMPRESSIONS,</i> <i> GODDARD DETERMINED THAT</i> <i> FRED BURKE'S TOMMY GUNS</i> <i> WERE USED IN THE MASSACRE.</i> SO THESE CAME FROM THE SAME GUN. WELL, I HAVE THESE SHELLS, AND I SHOT THESE SHELLS FROM MIKE'S GUN. <i> PAUL OFFERS TO TAKE</i> <i> A CLOSER LOOK.</i> <i> ALTHOUGH THE CARTRIDGE SHELLS</i> <i> FROM THE CRIME SCENE</i> <i> ARE LONG GONE, HE SAYS</i> <i> GODDARD DID EXAMINE THEM</i> <i> AND TESTIFIED IN FRONT</i> <i> OF THE CORONER'S GRAND JURY.</i> THE CHARACTERISTICS THAT GODDARD EMPHASIZED IN HIS TESTIMONY, THOUGH, WERE THE EXTRACTOR AND EJECTOR MARKS. EXTRACTOR MARKS ARE THE MARKINGS THAT OCCUR WHEN A SHELL IS IN THE CHAMBER OF A GUN AND IS EXTRACTED FROM THE CHAMBER, AND AN EJECTOR MARKING OCCURS WHEN THE SHELL IS KICKED OUT OF THE GUN. <i> WE TAKE A CLOSE LOOK</i> <i> AT OUR SHELLS.</i> OH, THOSE TWO LITTLE SCRATCHES? THAT IS CORRECT. I SEE THEM. <i> WHAT PAUL TELLS ME NEXT</i> <i> IS CERTAINLY GOING TO BE</i> <i> OF INTEREST TO MIKE.</i> INVESTIGATORS FOUND BULLETS AND SHELLS AT THE SCENE OF THE CRIME, AND TWO OF THOSE SHELLS WERE FROM A 12-GAUGE SHOTGUN, THE SAME GAUGE AS YOUR SHOTGUN. THAT GETS US VERY CLOSE. <i> I TELL MIKE THAT THE STRANGE</i> <i> CARVED NOTCHES ON HIS WEAPON</i> <i> COULD HAVE BEEN</i> <i> A GANGSTER SIGNATURE,</i> <i> INDICATING THE WEAPON</i> <i> HAD BEEN USED IN A MURDER.</i> <i> SIMILAR MARKINGS</i> <i> HAD ALSO BEEN SEEN</i> <i> ON THE THOMPSON SUBMACHINE GUNS</i> <i> USED IN THE MASSACRE.</i> <i> ALTHOUGH MISSING EVIDENCE</i> <i> MADE A DIRECT COMPARISON</i> <i> WITH HIS SHELLS</i> <i> IMPOSSIBLE TODAY,</i> <i> AT THE TIME OF THE MASSACRE,</i> <i> THE EXPERT BROUGHT IN</i> <i> BY THE AUTHORITIES</i> <i> HAD CONDUCTED A THOROUGH</i> <i> FORENSIC INVESTIGATION.</i> GODDARD DID CLOSELY EXAMINE THE SHELLS THAT WERE FOUND AT THE SCENE OF THE CRIME, AND HE MADE A PRETTY INTERESTING DISCOVERY. THESE ARE THE TYPES OF MARKINGS THAT GODDARD FOUND ON THE SHELLS FROM THE SCENE OF THE CRIME. <i> GODDARD HAD DETERMINED</i> <i> THAT THE SHOTGUN USED</i> <i> IN THE MURDER OF SEVEN MEN</i> <i> ON ST. VALENTINE'S DAY, 1929,</i> <i> WAS A PUMP-ACTION GUN, TOO,</i> <i> THE SAME AS MIKE'S.</i> SO IN YOUR OPINION, COULD THIS GUN HAVE BEEN USED IN THE MASSACRE? YES. IT IS THE RIGHT VINTAGE. IT HAS BOTH THE EXTRACTOR AND EJECTOR MARKINGS WHICH GODDARD IDENTIFIED. WE CAN PROVE THAT THE GUN THAT WAS SHOT THAT DAY WAS A 12-GAUGE REPEATING SHOTGUN. YOUR GUN IS A 12-GAUGE REPEATING SHOTGUN. RIGHT, RIGHT. THAT'S GREAT. <i> I TELL MIKE THERE ARE</i> <i> NO SURVIVING POLICE RECORDS</i> <i> OF ANY OTHER SHOTGUN</i> <i> BEING RECOVERED BY POLICE</i> <i> AND TIED TO THE KILLINGS.</i> WHILE WE CAN'T CONCLUSIVELY LINK YOUR GUN TO THE MASSACRE, NO EVIDENCE RULES IT OUT. VERY INTERESTING. SO IF THE ORIGINAL SHELLS SURFACE, THEN WE WOULD BE ABLE TO FINISH GODDARD'S WORK AND DETERMINE IF YOUR GUN FIRED THEM. HOW DO YOU THINK YOUR FATHER WOULD FEEL, THE FACT THAT WE'VE COME THIS FAR? HE WOULD BE ECSTATIC. HE WOULD SAY, I TOLD YOU SO.

THE GUN THAT MADE THE '20s ROAR WAS INSPIRED BY WORLD WAR I TRENCH WARFARE. THE THOMPSON SUBMACHINE GUN WAS DESIGNED BY RETIRED GENERAL JOHN THOMPSON. EARLY MACHINE GUNS WERE EXTREMELY HEAVY AND TOOK SEVERAL MEN TO OPERATE. THOMPSON'S SOLUTION WAS A RAPID-FIRING WEAPON OPERATED BY A SINGLE SOLDIER. THE TRENCH BROOM WAS DESIGNED TO SWEEP THE ENEMY OUT OF FOXHOLES. BUT THE GUN WASN'T READY UNTIL AFTER THE WAR ENDED, SO THE GENERAL TRIED SELLING IT TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. ONE NOTORIOUS AD FEATURED A COWBOY DEFENDING HIS RANCH FROM BANDITS. DEEMED SIMPLE, SAFE, STURDY, AND SURE IN ACTION, AN ORIGINAL TOMMY COULD FIRE 1,500 ROUNDS PER MINUTE. GANGSTERS SAW THE POTENTIAL. THE GUN WAS SUCH A FAVORITE OF THE CHICAGO MOB THAT IT WAS ALSO KNOWN AS THE CHICAGO TYPEWRITER, THE CHICAGO PIANO, AND THE CHICAGO ORGAN GRINDER. FOR CONCEALMENT, THE COMPACT GUN COULD BE TOTED AROUND IN A REFITTED MUSICAL INSTRUMENT CASE. THE THOMPSON DID MAKE IT TO THE BATTLEFIELD IN WORLD WAR II. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS WERE ORDERED AT A COST OF NEARLY $130 MILLION TOTAL. BY THE END OF THE WAR, LIGHTER AND CHEAPER COMPETITORS ENDED THE TOMMY'S REIGN. Tukufu: <i> OUR NEXT STORY INVESTIGATES</i> <i> A DEATH THREAT SENT</i> <i> TO ONE OF THE FIRST PRESIDENTS</i> <i> OF THE UNITED STATES.</i> <i> ON APRIL 14, 1865,</i> <i> A MAN STANDING</i> <i> IN THE SHADOWS</i> <i> OF PRESIDENT ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S</i> <i> THEATER BOX</i> <i> FIRED ONE FINAL SHOT.</i> <i> IT WAS THE FIRST ASSASSINATION</i> <i> OF AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT,</i> <i> AND JOHN WILKES BOOTH'S MOTIVES</i> <i> HAVE BEEN QUESTIONED</i> <i> AND STUDIED FOR GENERATIONS.</i> <i> NOW, ALMOST 150 YEARS LATER, </i> <i> MARSHA MULLIN</i> <i> OF NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE,</i> <i> HAS LEARNED OF A LETTER</i> <i> SUPPOSEDLY WRITTEN</i> <i> BY JOHN WILKES BOOTH'S FATHER</i> <i> TO ANOTHER AMERICAN PRESIDENT.</i> TODAY SOMEBODY WOULD BE TAKEN OFF TO JAIL IN FIVE MINUTES FOR WRITING A LETTER LIKE THAT. <i> MARSHA HAS INVITED ME</i> <i> TO THE HERMITAGE,</i> <i> PRESIDENT ANDREW JACKSON'S</i> <i> FAMILY HOME IN NASHVILLE,</i> <i> WHERE SHE IS CHIEF CURATOR.</i> SO WHAT DO YOU HAVE FOR ME? WELL, A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, A VISITOR BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION THIS LETTER, WHICH WAS A DEATH THREAT TO ANDREW JACKSON WRITTEN IN 1835. I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT, SO I GOT A COPY OF IT FROM THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS. <i> THE SIGNATURE ON</i> <i> THE DEATH THREAT READS</i> <i> JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH.</i> JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH WAS A VERY FAMOUS ACTOR, BUT INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, HE WAS ALSO THE FATHER OF JOHN WILKES BOOTH. NOW, THAT'S AN INTERESTING CONNECTION. IT'S VERY INTERESTING. <i> IT'S DATED</i> <i> THE 4th OF JULY, 1835,</i> <i> FROM BROWER'S HOTEL,</i> <i> PHILADELPHIA.</i> YOU DAMNED OLD SCOUNDREL, I WILL CUT YOUR THROAT WHILST YOU ARE SLEEPING. <i> HE'S INSISTING THAT JACKSON</i> <i> PARDON TWO MEN ON DEATH ROW.</i> I'LL HAVE YOU BURNT AT THE STAKE IN THE CITY OF WASHINGTON. YOUR MASTER, JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH. MAN, NOW THIS IS A THREAT. SO THE FATHER OF THE GUY WHO KILLED LINCOLN THREATENED TO ASSASSINATE A PRESIDENT. WELL, THAT'S THE QUESTION. BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BACK OF THE LETTER, SOMEONE HAS WRITTEN ANONYMOUS. AND SO THAT WAS VERY CURIOUS. IS IT BY JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH OR NOT? JACKSON SCHOLARS SEEM TO BELIEVE THAT IT WAS WRITTEN BY SOMEONE ELSE. WE'D LIKE TO KNOW IF JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH REALLY WROTE THIS LETTER, AND IF HE DID, WHY? WELL, LET ME SEE IF I CAN FIND AN ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION. <i> THE SINS OF A FATHER</i> <i> ARE NOT NECESSARILY VISITED</i> <i> UPON THE SON.</i> <i> BUT PRESIDENT LINCOLN'S MURDER</i> <i> ALTERED AMERICAN HISTORY.</i> <i> IF JOHN WILKES BOOTH'S FATHER</i> <i> ALSO THREATENED THE LIFE</i> <i> OF A SITTING PRESIDENT,</i> <i> THAT'S CERTAINLY INTERESTING</i> <i> AND POSSIBLY SIGNIFICANT.</i> <i> JACKSON WAS THE 7th PRESIDENT</i> <i> OF THE UNITED STATES</i> <i> AND FIRST TOOK OFFICE</i> <i> IN 1829.</i> <i> JUNIUS BOOTH WAS</i> THE<i> POPULAR</i> <i> SHAKESPEAREAN ACTOR OF THE DAY.</i> <i> THE QUESTION IS,</i> <i> WHY HAVE HISTORIANS DOUBTED</i> <i> THAT JUNIUS BOOTH WROTE THIS</i> <i> IN THE FIRST PLACE?</i> <i> MARSHA'S LEFT ME</i> <i> 20th-CENTURY PUBLICATIONS</i> <i> OF A JACKSON BIOGRAPHY</i> <i> AND A COLLECTION</i> <i> OF HIS CORRESPONDENCE.</i> <i> BOTH VOLUMES INCLUDE MENTION</i> <i> OF OUR LETTER.</i> JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH HERE IS IN QUOTATION MARKS. BOOTH, IN QUOTATION MARKS, TO ANDREW JACKSON, JULY 4, 1835. <i> THE QUOTATION MARKS INDICATE</i> <i> THE AUTHORS AND EDITORS</i> <i> ALSO DOUBTED THAT BOOTH WROTE</i> <i> THE DEATH THREAT.</i> I NEED TO FOUND OUT IF THESE DOUBTS ARE BASED ON SOME ACTUAL EVIDENCE. <i> THE LETTER WRITER,</i> <i> WHOEVER HE WAS,</i> <i> WANTED TWO MEN PARDONED:</i> <i> DE RUIZ AND DE SOTO.</i> <i> I WONDER WHAT OTHER CLUES</i> <i> THERE MIGHT BE.</i> IT SAYS DOWN HERE IN A POSTSCRIPT, YOU KNOW ME, LOOK OUT. DOES IT MEAN THAT HE KNEW HIM PERSONALLY? DOES IT MEAN THAT HE KNEW OF HIM? I WROTE TO YOU REPEATED CAUTIONS. DID HE WRITE MORE THREATS TO THE PRESIDENT? <i> THE PAPERS OF ANDREW JACKSON</i> <i> PROJECT</i> <i> AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE</i> <i> IN KNOXVILLE</i> <i> IS IN THE PROCESS OF PUBLISHING</i> <i> AN UPDATED VERSION</i> <i> OF EVERY KNOWN DOCUMENT</i> <i> THAT JACKSON WROTE OR RECEIVED.</i> <i> DAN FELLER IS THE DIRECTOR</i> <i> AND EDITOR OF THE PROJECT.</i> LET'S GO INTO THE JACKSON PAPERS. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THIS LETTER BEFORE? OH, YES, WE KNOW IT WELL. WE DON'T THINK THAT THE REAL JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH WROTE IT. OUR ASSUMPTION IS THAT THE ORIGINAL NOTATION WAS CORRECT, THAT IT'S ANONYMOUS. <i> DAN EXPLAINS THAT</i> <i> PRESIDENT JACKSON'S STRONG-HAND</i> <i> AND OFTEN UNPOPULAR POLICIES</i> <i> HAD MADE HIM A LIGHTNING ROD</i> <i> FOR CRITICISM AND THREATS.</i> <i> SIX MONTHS BEFORE</i> <i> OUR LETTER WAS WRITTEN,</i> <i> HE WAS THE VICTIM OF</i> <i> THE FIRST ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT</i> <i> AGAINST AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT.</i> <i> A DERANGED HOUSE PAINTER</i> <i> ATTEMPTED TO SHOOT HIM</i> <i> OUTSIDE THE CAPITOL BUILDING,</i> <i> BUT THE PISTOL MISFIRED.</i> SHORTLY AFTER THAT, THE<i> WASHINGTON GLOBE</i> PUBLISHED SEVERAL COLUMNS OF ASSASSINATION LETTERS THAT IT SAID JACKSON HAD RECEIVED. LET ME PUT THESE UP ON OUR COMPUTER SCREEN SO YOU CAN READ THEM BETTER. HERE'S ONE. DAMN YOUR OLD SOUL, IF YOU DO NOT DO SOMETHING FOR THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY, I WILL MURDER YOU. WOW. <i> DAN SAYS JACKSON</i> <i> DREW PUBLIC CRITICISM</i> <i> BECAUSE HE WANTED TO DO AWAY</i> <i> WITH THE FEDERALLY CHARTERED</i> <i> BANK OF THE UNITED STATES,</i> <i> WHICH HE REGARDED AS AN</i> <i> UNCONSTITUTIONAL CONCENTRATION</i> <i> OF FINANCIAL POWER.</i> HERE'S ANOTHER ONE: REMOVE THEM DEPOSITS BACK AGAIN AND RECHARTER THE BANK, OR YOU WILL CERTAINLY BE SHOT IN LESS THAN TWO WEEKS, AND THAT BY MYSELF! THE UNITED STATES SENATE ACTUALLY CENSURED JACKSON FOR REMOVING THE DEPOSITS, THE ONLY TIME A PRESIDENT HAS EVER BEEN CENSURED BY THE SENATE. <i> DAN SAYS T RUIZ AND DE SOTO</i> <i> MENTIONED IN OUR LETTER</i> <i> WERE SPANISH PIRATES OPERATING</i> <i> OUT OF HAVANA.</i> <i> WITH TEN OTHERS,</i> <i> THEY HAD ROBBED</i> <i> AN AMERICAN MERCHANT SHIP</i> <i> IN SEPTEMBER 1832.</i> <i> THE PIRATES' CAPTURE</i> <i> AND SUBSEQUENT TRIAL</i> <i> ELECTRIFIED THE NATION.</i> THIS WAS A HUGE CASE. IT HAD ALL OF THE ASPECTS OF A MODERN SHOW TRIAL. <i> ONE OF THE SPANIARDS,</i> <i> DE SOTO,</i> <i> WAS PARDONED MOST LIKELY</i> <i> BECAUSE HE PREVIOUSLY HAD SAVED</i> <i> THE LIVES OF SOME</i> <i> AMERICAN SAILORS.</i> <i> DAN SAYS THE PARDON</i> <i> WAS ALMOST CERTAINLY NOT</i> <i> AS A RESULT</i> <i> OF THE DEATH THREAT.</i> HOW SERIOUSLY WAS THIS THREAT TAKEN? <i> DAN DOUBTS THERE WAS</i> <i> ANY OFFICIAL INVESTIGATION</i> <i> INTO THE LETTER.</i> <i> THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT</i> <i> DID NOT HAVE</i> <i> THE PROTECTIVE LAYERS</i> <i> IT HAS TODAY.</i> THERE WAS NO SECRET SERVICE, THERE WAS NO FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION, THERE WERE REALLY NO WHITE HOUSE POLICE. IN FACT, ASSASSINATING THE PRESIDENT OR THREATENING TO DO SO WAS NOT A FEDERAL CRIME. HERE HE SAYS, I WROTE TO YOU REPEATED CAUTIONS. DO YOU KNOW OF ANY OTHER COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN BOOTH AND JACKSON? IF THERE WERE ANY, WE WOULD HAVE SEEN THEM. WE KNOW OF ONE LETTER FROM SOMEONE CALLING HIMSELF JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH TO JACKSON, AND THIS IS IT. AND THAT'S IT. AND NOT ONLY NO LETTERS FROM BOOTH OR TO BOOTH, BUT NO MENTION OF BOOTH IN JACKSON'S CORRESPONDENCE. <i> WHOEVER WANTED</i> <i> THESE PIRATES PARDONED,</i> <i> DAN'S CONVINCED</i> <i> IT WASN'T BOOTH.</i> EVERY HISTORIAN PREVIOUS TO US, EVERY JACKSON BIOGRAPHER, HAS ASSUMED THAT BOOTH DIDN'T WRITE IT. SOMEONE IN HIS OFFICE -
- AND HE HAD A NUMBER OF CLERKS WORKING FOR HIM -
- PROBABLY WROTE THIS WORD ANONYMOUS. JACKSON DID NOT WRITE IT. IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE JACKSON'S HANDWRITING, NO. HAS THERE BEEN AN ANALYSIS OF THE HANDWRITING IN THIS LETTER? AS FAR AS I KNOW, NO ONE HAS EVER TAKEN IT TO THAT STEP BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT WAS UNNECESSARY. <i> THAT SEEMS A CURIOUS OMISSION.</i> <i> THE FOLGER SHAKESPEARE LIBRARY</i> <i> IN WASHINGTON, D.C.,</i> <i> HAS SEVERAL JUNIUS BOOTH</i> <i> LETTERS IN THEIR COLLECTION.</i> <i> HEATHER WOLFE IS CURATOR</i> <i> OF MANUSCRIPTS.</i> <i> SHE'S MADE SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS</i> <i> WITH THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS</i> <i> TO OBTAIN THE ORIGINAL THREAT</i> <i> TO JACKSON.</i> HEATHER, NICE TO MEET YOU. SO THIS IS THE ORIGINAL LETTER. I PICKED TWO OF OUR JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH LETTERS FOR A HANDWRITING ANALYSIS. I PICKED THESE TWO LETTERS BECAUSE THEY WERE CLOSEST IN DATE AND FORMAT TO THE 1835 LETTER TO GENERAL JACKSON. <i> IT'S THE FIRST TIME</i> <i> HEATHER HAS SEEN</i> <i> THE ORIGINAL LETTER</i> <i> TO JACKSON,</i> <i> AND A COUPLE OF ITEMS</i> <i> STRIKE HER AS ODD.</i> HE SIGNS THE LETTER TO JACKSON WITH HIS FULL NAME, JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH. ALL OF THE LETTERS AT THE FOLGER ARE SIGNED J.B. BOOTH, AND THAT WAS HIS TYPICAL SIGNATURE. <i> THE REST OF THE LETTER</i> <i> LOOKS AS IF</i> <i> IT COULD'VE FLOWED</i> <i> FROM THE SAME PEN.</i> AND YOU SEE HERE, I WROTE TO YOU REPEATED CAUTIONS, AND SEE THE BOTTOM OF THAT C, HOW IT LOOPS AROUND DRAMATICALLY? WELL, IN THIS LETTER HERE, WE SEE THE WORD CAMP WITH THAT SAME VERY DISTINCTIVE MAJUSCULE C, WHICH IS VERY UNIQUE TO JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH. ONE OF THE MOST DISTINCTIVE ATTRIBUTES HE HAS IS THE CROSSBAR ON THE MINISCULE T's. SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE WORD THE IN THIS LETTER, THE CROSSBAR GOES FULLY ACROSS NOT JUST THE T BUT ALSO THE H AND THE E. <i> IF BOOTH DIDN'T WRITE THIS</i> <i> HIMSELF,</i> <i> SHE SAYS THE FORGER WAS</i> <i> AT THE TOP OF HIS CLASS.</i> <i> HEATHER'S MADE</i> <i> ANOTHER DISCOVERY.</i> THIS LETTER FROM 1834 MENTIONS THAT HE NEEDED TO ESCAPE THE FARM FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS AND GO TO PHILADELPHIA, AND IT SAYS, THEREFORE I STROLLED TO PHILADELPHIA. BROWER'S HOTEL IS NOW ABOUT THE BEST IN THAT CITY. SO HE HAS A HISTORY OF FREQUENTING THE BROWER'S HOTEL IN PHILADELPHIA. SO WHAT DO YOU THINK? DID JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH WRITE THIS LETTER? BASED ON HANDWRITING ANALYSIS ALONE, YES, IT IS A JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH LETTER. BUT I'M NOT A BOOTH EXPERT, SO I THINK THAT'S A QUESTION FOR BOOTH SCHOLARS. WE'D NEED TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE CONTEXT OF THE LETTER. <i> WHY DID A FAMOUS</i> <i> SHAKESPEAREAN ACTOR</i> <i> CARE ENOUGH ABOUT THE FATE</i> <i> OF TWO SPANISH PIRATES</i> <i> TO HAVE PENNED</i> <i> A DEATH THREAT</i> <i> TO THE PRESIDENT</i> <i> OF THE UNITED STATES?</i> <i> GENE SMITH HAS AGREED</i> <i> TO MEET ME</i> <i> AT THE FOLGER LIBRARY'S</i> <i> ELIZABETHAN THEATER.</i> <i> HE'S THE AUTHOR OF A BOOK</i> <i> ON THE BOOTH FAMILY'S INFLUENCE</i> <i> ON AMERICAN THEATER.</i> IN ADDITION TO BEING A GREAT ACTOR, JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH WAS A GREAT MADMAN ALL HIS LIFE. THERE'S NO QUESTION HE WAS INSANE. <i> GENE SAYS THAT THE WILD</i> <i> AND ERRATIC BEHAVIOR ONSTAGE</i> <i> LED BOOTH TO BE DUBBED</i> <i> THE MAD TRAGEDIAN.</i> HIS BOUTS OF LUNACY COULD INTERRUPT A PRODUCTION. HE WOULD RUN AWAY FROM THE THEATER AND BE FOUND WALKING NAKED DOWN THE STREET. <i> BOOTH'S EXCESSIVE DRINKING</i> <i> EXACERBATED HIS MADNESS.</i> THEATER MANAGERS WOULD LOCK HIM UP TO KEEP HIM FROM GETTING DRUNK. FREQUENTLY, HE WOULD ESCAPE AND SIMPLY VANISH FOR THREE OR FOUR DAYS. DID HIS FITS OF MADNESS LEAD HIM TO ACTS OF VIOLENCE? YES, BUT ONLY VERY OCCASIONALLY. HE WAS CAPABLE IN THE MIDDLE OF A PERFORMANCE OF BECOMING SO INVOLVED IN KILLING DESDEMONA AS OTHELLO THAT WHEN THE MOMENT CAME TO PRESS THE PILLOW AGAINST DESDEMONA'S FACE, PEOPLE WERE AFRAID HE WOULD ACTUALLY MURDER THE ACTRESS. WELL, THIS LETTER IS A THREAT TO ASSASSINATE PRESIDENT ANDREW JACKSON. COULD THAT VIOLENT BEHAVIOR HAVE EXTENDED TO MURDER? IT IS POSSIBLE. HOWEVER, IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH HAD A REVERENCE FOR LIFE THAT WAS EXTRAORDINARY. GENERALLY, HE HURT NOBODY BUT HIMSELF: HIS KIDS WERE FORBIDDEN TO SWAT A FLY, HE WOULD NOT CUT DOWN A TREE. <i> HIS DEATH THREAT,</i> <i> IF BOOTH PENNED IT,</i> <i> MAY HAVE BEEN A BOUT</i> <i> OF ALCOHOLIC MADNESS,</i> <i> HIS REVERENCE FOR LIFE</i> <i> BIZARRELY PROVOKING HIM</i> <i> TO THREATEN MURDER.</i> MY GUESS WOULD BE THAT MR. BOOTH PROBABLY READ THAT JACKSON WAS CONSIDERING THE EXECUTION OF THESE TWO MEN AND, IN ONE OF HIS FRENZIES, THREATENED TO KILL HIM. <i> HE DOUBTS PRESIDENT JACKSON</i> <i> TOOK IT SERIOUSLY.</i> INDEED, THE LETTER SAYS, YOU KNOW ME, AND HE DID KNOW HIM. JACKSON AND BOOTH WERE CLOSE PERSONAL FRIENDS. I THINK JACKSON WOULD'VE PROBABLY SAID, WELL, THAT'S BOOTH FOR YOU, AND JACKSON WOULD'VE LAUGHED IT OFF. <i> GENE PAINTS A PICTURE</i> <i> OF A TURBULENT</i> <i> AND DEEPLY TROUBLED MAN</i> <i> FREQUENTLY ABSENT</i> <i> FROM HIS FAMILY.</i> JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH WAS AWAY ON THE ROAD, TROUPING AROUND AS AN ACTOR FOR MUCH OF THE YEAR. <i> BUT GENE IS RELUCTANT</i> <i> TO MAKE ANY CONNECTION</i> <i> BETWEEN THE DEATH THREAT</i> <i> JUNIUS BOOTH MAY HAVE MADE</i> <i> TO PRESIDENT JACKSON</i> <i> AND HIS SON'S MURDER OF</i> <i> ABRAHAM LINCOLN 30 YEARS LATER.</i> I THINK IT'S EXCEEDINGLY IMPROBABLE. HIS KILLING OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS SO ALIEN TO HIS FATHER'S REVERENCE FOR LIFE THAT THERE CANNOBE ANY TRACEABLE PATH. <i> I'M NOT SURE WHAT TO MAKE</i> <i> OF ALL OF THIS,</i> <i> AND I STILL DON'T HAVE</i> <i> ANY SOLID EVIDENCE</i> <i> TO SUPPORT</i> <i> THE HANDWRITING ANALYSIS.</i> [ cell phone rings ] HEY, DAN, HOW YOU DOING? <i> IT'S DAN FELLER.</i> <i> SEEMS OUR MEETING</i> <i> PROMPTED HIM</i> <i> TO DO SOME ADDITIONAL RESEARCH.</i> <i> I TELL DAN ABOUT</i> <i> THE HANDWRITING COMPARISON</i> <i> AND WHAT ELSE I'VE LEARNED</i> <i> ABOUT JUNIUS BOOTH.</i> IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED TO ME THAT JACKSON AND BOOTH WERE ACTUALLY FRIENDS AND THAT THIS LETTER WAS WRITTEN IN JEST. I DOUBT THAT VERY MUCH. WE HAVE HERE ALL OF ANDREW JACKSON'S LETTERS THAT ANYONE KNOWS ABOUT; WE KNOW OF NO EVIDENCE TO PUT JACKSON AND BOOTH TOGETHER IN ANY WAY. <i> HIS TEAM HAS UNCOVERED SEVERAL</i> <i> NEW PIECES OF INFORMATION.</i> <i> OUR LETTER'S DATED JULY 4th.</i> <i> HE'S BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE OUT</i> <i> BOOTH'S WHEREABOUTS THAT DAY.</i> THESE ARE NEWSPAPER ADVERTISEMENTS SHOWING THAT BOOTH WAS INDEED IN PHILADELPHIA ON JULY 3rd AND 4th. HE WAS SCHEDULED TO PLAY OTHELLO ON THE 3rd AT THE CHESTNUT STREET THEATRE... I SEE. AND SCHEDULED TO PLAY RICHARD III ON THE 4th. <i> THAT PUTS BOOTH</i> <i> IN PHILADELPHIA</i> <i> AT THE TIME THE LETTER</i> <i> WAS WRITTEN.</i> AND HERE'S THE REAL CLINCHER. THIS IS ANOTHER LETTER THAT BOOTH WROTE IN AUGUST OF 1835. HE APOLOGIZES FOR THE UNGRATEFUL AND SHAMEFUL CONDUCT I HAVE EVINCED TOWARD THE WORTHY MANAGERS OF THE CHESTNUT STREET THEATRE ON A RECENT OCCASION, FRIDAY, JULY 3rd, AND SATURDAY THE 4th. IN FACT, HE DID NOT PLAY ON JULY 3rd AND 4th; HE DIDN'T SHOW UP. SO HE WAS THERE, AND MAYBE IN ONE OF HIS FITS OF MADNESS, DID NOT PERFORM. EXACTLY. <i> BUT AS FOR THREATENING</i> <i> TO ASSASSINATE THE PRESIDENT,</i> <i> I STILL DON'T HAVE</i> <i> A SMOKING GUN.</i> BUT LOOK FURTHER DOWN IN THE LETTER. <i> THERE AT THE END,</i> <i> JUNIUS BOOTH HIMSELF GIVES ME</i> <i> MY FINAL PIECE</i> <i> OF THE PUZZLE.</i> MY INSANE BEHAVIOR... <i> I THINK I FINALLY HAVE</i> <i> AN ANSWER FOR MARSHA.</i> VERY INTERESTING INVESTIGATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET INTO THE LIFE OF JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH. <i> I TELL MARSHA</i> <i> THAT THE HANDWRITING</i> <i> OF THIS ASSASSINATION THREAT</i> <i> MATCHED OTHER LETTERS</i> <i> PENNED BY BOOTH.</i> THAT'S COOL; I AM REALLY PLEASED. <i> BUT WHAT TIED</i> <i> THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE</i> <i> TOGETHER WAS AN OPEN LETTER</i> <i> FROM BOOTH</i> <i> THAT SEEMED TO BE</i> <i> AN ADMISSION OF GUILT.</i> HE SAYS, MY INSANE BEHAVIOR IN WRITING INSOLENT LETTERS TO MY BEST PATRONS AND TO THE AUTHORITIES OF THIS COUNTRY I CAN SCARCELY HOPE WILL BE PARDONED. THE AUTHORITIES OF THIS COUNTRY. YOU THINK HE'S REFERRING TO PRESIDENT ANDREW JACKSON HERE? I'LL BET HE IS, BECAUSE ONE SENTENCE FURTHER DOWN, HE SAYS, MAY GOD PRESERVE GENERAL JACKSON AND THIS HAPPY REPUBLIC. <i> DAN SAYS</i> <i> OUR HANDWRITING ANALYSIS</i> <i> AND HIS QUESTIONING</i> <i> OF CONVENTIONAL WISDOM</i> <i> HAVE CORRECTED</i> <i> THE HISTORICAL RECORD.</i> <i> PRESIDENT LINCOLN'S KILLER,</i> <i> JOHN WILKES BOOTH,</i> <i> WAS FATHERED BY A MAN</i> <i> WHO ALSO THREATENED</i> <i> TO MURDER A SITTING PRESIDENT.</i> WE HAD ASSUMED, AS THOSE BEFORE US HAD ASSUMED, THAT THE REAL BOOTH DIDN'T WRITE THIS LETTER ON THE BASIS OF THAT ONE WORD, ANONYMOUS. IT TURNED OUT HE DID. IT REMINDS US ALWAYS TO CHECK OUR FACTS, ALWAYS TO GO BACK AND VERIFY, EVEN WHEN WE THINK WE KNOW WHAT REALLY HAPPENED. THAT IS AMAZING. I'M SHOCKED. I MEAN, IT'S AN INTERESTING COINCIDENCE THAT HE WROTE SUCH A LETTER AND THAT HIS SON ENDED UP ASSASSINATING LINCOLN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO INVESTIGATE THIS STORY. THANK YOU. WHOSE JOB IS IT TO PROTECT THE PRESIDENT? WELL, BEFORE THE SECRET SERVICE, IT WAS SOMETIMES THE ARMY, SOMETIMES THE LOCAL POLICE. BUT LOTS OF TIMES, IT WAS NO ONE. JEFFERSON WALKED TO HIS OWN INAUGURATION UNGUARDED. MARTIN VAN BUREN WALKED TO CHURCH ON SUNDAYS ALONE. ON THE NIGHT LINCOLN WAS ASSASSINATED, A LOCAL WASHINGTON PATROLMAN HAD BEEN ASSIGNED TO PROTECT THE PRESIDENT, BUT HE ABANDONED HIS POST TO GET A BETTER VIEW OF THE PLAY. THE SECRET SERVICE WAS CREATED FOUR MONTHS AFTER LINCOLN'S ASSASSINATION NOT TO PROTECT THE PRESIDENT BUT TO PROTECT THE ECONOMY. ITS AGENTS WERE CHARGED WITH FIGHTING COUNTERFEITING. TWO MORE PRESIDENTS WOULD BE ASSASSINATED BEFORE PRESIDENTIAL PROTECTION BECAME A FULL-TIME NATIONAL PRIORITY. ONE GUNMAN KILLED PRESIDENT GARFIELD AT A WASHINGTON TRAIN STATION IN 1881 AND ANOTHER GUNMAN SHOT PRESIDENT McKINLEY AT THE PAN-AM EXPO IN BUFFALO IN 1901. AFTER THREE ASSASSINATIONS IN LESS THAN 40 YEARS, CONGRESS FINALLY ASSIGNED THE SECRET SERVICE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SAFETY OF THE PRESIDENT AT ALL TIMES. Wes: <i> OUR LAST STORY EXPLORES</i> <i> A BLACK MARKET TRADE</i> <i> THAT SCANDALIZED</i> <i> POST-CIVIL-WAR OHIO.</i> <i> SINCE BEFORE THE TIME</i> <i> OF THE PHARAOHS,</i> <i> CIVILIZATIONS HAVE BEEN</i> <i> BURYING THEIR DEAD</i> <i> ALONG WITH PERSONAL EFFECTS,</i> <i> JEWELRY AND ARTIFACTS</i> <i> THAT COULD</i> <i> MAKE A THIEF RICH</i> <i> OVERNIGHT.</i> <i> BUT LEFT UNGUARDED,</i> <i> THESE COFFINS AND TOMBS</i> <i> FREQUENTLY BECAME THE TREASURE</i> <i> CHESTS OF GRAVE ROBBERS.</i> <i> OVER THE CENTURIES,</i> <i> COUNTLESS SITES</i> <i> HAVE BEEN DESECRATED,</i> <i> LOOTED,</i> <i> AND VALUABLE HISTORIC ARTIFACTS</i> <i> LOST TO THE BLACK MARKET.</i> <i> HENRY DORRUM</i> <i> OF CHESANING, MICHIGAN,</i> <i> BELIEVES HE'S FOUND</i> <i> THE 19th-CENTURY ANSWER</i> <i> TO THIS HISTORIC PROBLEM.</i> I'VE BEEN COLLECTING FOR ABOUT 25 YEARS, AND THIS IS THE MOST UNUSUAL OBJECT I'VE EVER FOUND. <i> I WANT TO GET A LOOK</i> <i> AT WHAT KIND OF STRANGE GADGET</i> <i> HENRY BOUGHT FOR HIMSELF.</i> WELL, WHAT'S IN THE BOX? I DON'T KNOW. I THOUGHT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE. IT'S A HEAVY LITTLE DEVIL. OH, THAT IS HEAVY. WHERE'D YOU GET THIS THING? AT A FARM AUCTION IN SAGINAW COUNTY, MICHIGAN. I LIKE UNUSUAL ITEMS OF ALL KINDS. I'M A COLLECTOR OF ANYTHING. I'VE GOT TO ASK YOU, ARE YOU SURE THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO EXPLODE? OH, NO, IT'S BEEN THOROUGHLY CHECKED. I'VE HAD IT FOR A LONG TIME, AND YOU CAN LOOK DOWN IN THERE, AND IT'S COMPLETELY VOID OF ANY POWDER. <i> HENRY EXPLAINS THAT ONCE</i> <i> WHEN HE HAD IT ON DISPLAY</i> <i> AT A BALTIMORE GUN SHOW,</i> <i> A PASSERBY CLAIMED</i> <i> HE RECOGNIZED THE DEVICE.</i> <i> HE TOLD HENRY IT WAS</i> <i> A KIND OF GRAVE ALARM.</i> I'D SEEN A PICTURE OF IT IN A MAGAZINE YEARS AGO, AND THAT'S WHAT IT WAS, A GRAVE ALARM. I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, I'VE NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING. <i> THE STRANGER TOLD HIM</i> <i> GRAVE ALARMS WERE USED</i> <i> TO PROTECT JEWELRY</i> <i> AND OTHER VALUABLES</i> <i> THAT MAY HAVE BEEN BURIED</i> <i> WITH THE DECEASED.</i> THEY WOULD PUT ONE OF THESE IN THE CASKET, AND WHEN THE GRAVE ROBBER OPENS THE COFFIN, IT'S GOING TO BLOW UP IN HIS FACE. WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WANT ME TO FIND OUT ABOUT THIS? I WANT YOU GUYS TO FIND OUT IF THIS TRULY IS A GRAVE ALARM. WELL, HENRY, I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DIG UP. <i> I CAN'T FIND ANY MAKER'S MARK</i> <i> OR SERIAL NUMBER,</i> <i> WHICH IS A LITTLE ODD IF THIS</i> <i> HAD BEEN MANUFACTURED FOR SALE.</i> <i> I'M SKEPTICAL THIS IS AN ALARM,</i> <i> AS HENRY BELIEVES.</i> <i> IT LOOKS MORE LIKE SOME</i> <i> KIND OF CIVIL-WAR-ERA WEAPON.</i> THIS IS A BOMB. I MEAN, THIS THING WOULD'VE HELD MAYBE HALF A POUND, THREE-QUARTERS OF A POUND OF BLACK POWDER IN HERE. <i> IT WEIGHS ABOUT EIGHT POUNDS</i> <i> AND IT'S MADE OF CAST IRON,</i> <i> WHICH WOULD'VE TURNED INTO</i> <i> SHARDS OF DEADLY SHRAPNEL</i> <i> IF THIS THING</i> <i> HAD EVER EXPLODED.</i> THIS IS A SPRING-LOADED HAMMER THAT WOULD'VE BEEN SET BY MOVING THIS METAL BAR ON THE COLLAR AROUND. <i> IF SOMEBODY STEPPED ON IT,</i> <i> THIS FIRING MECHANISM</i> <i> WOULD'VE ALMOST CERTAINLY</i> <i> HAVE BEEN ACTIVATED.</i> SO WHEN THIS LITTLE COLLAR IS MOVED EVEN A FRACTION OF AN INCH, THE HAMMER DROPS, AND THEN IT HITS AN EXPLOSIVE CAP, ALMOST LIKE A CAP GUN. AND IF YOU LOOK, YOU'LL SEE THAT THERE'S A HOLE ON THAT NIPPLE, SO A SPARK WOULD TRAVEL INTO THAT INTERIOR, IGNITE THE GUNPOWDER, AND BAM! <i> I'VE COME OUT</i> <i> TO THE CORDOVA DRAGWAY PARK,</i> <i> ABOUT TWO HOURS WEST</i> <i> OF CHICAGO,</i> <i> TO SEE JUST HOW DANGEROUS OUR</i> <i> EXPLOSIVE DEVICE WOULD'VE BEEN.</i> <i> LARRY LEFFERTS</i> <i> OF CENTRAL STATES FIREWORKS</i> <i> CONFIRMED THE AMOUNT</i> <i> OF BLACK POWDER</i> <i> OUR DEVICE WOULD'VE CARRIED.</i> WHAT WE DID WAS WE TOOK THREE-QUARTERS OF A POUND OF BLACK POWDER AND WE BURIED THEM AND PUT A LITTLE BIT OF DIRT ON TOP TO SIMULATE WHAT IT MAY LOOK LIKE. FIRE IN THE HOLE! FIRE IN THE HOLE! Wes: WHOA, THAT THING COULD DO SOME SERIOUS DAMAGE! <i> ABOUT AN HOUR FROM THE DRAGWAY</i> <i> IS T ROCK ISLAND ARSENAL.</i> <i> ESTABLISHED IN 1862,</i> <i> IT'S THE NATION'S LARGEST</i> <i> GOVERNMENT-OWNED</i> <i> AND OPERATED ARSENAL.</i> <i> KRIS LEINICKE IS</i> <i> THE CURATOR OF THE MUSEUM,</i> <i> WHICH HOUSES</i> <i> AN EXTENSIVE COLLECTION</i> <i> OF HISTORIC MILITARY WEAPONS.</i> THIS IS THE DEVICE I WANTED TO SHOW YOU. OKAY. WOW. WHAT DO YOU THINK IT COULD BE? IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE IT MIGHT BE A CIVIL-WAR TORPEDO. TORPEDO? <i> KRIS EXPLAINS THAT TODAY,</i> <i> TORPEDO IS KNOWN</i> <i> AS AN UNDERWATER WEAPON</i> <i> LAUNCHED FROM A SUBMARINE</i> <i> OR WARSHIP,</i> <i> BUT IT ONCE HAD</i> <i> A MUCH BROADER DEFINITION.</i> BEFORE THE FIRST WORLD WAR, A TORPEDO MEANT ANY HIDDEN EXPLOSIVE OR LAND MINE. <i> KRIS SAYS THAT PERCUSSION CAPS,</i> <i> WHICH FIT OVER THE NIPPLES</i> <i> AND PRODUCE THE SPARKS</i> <i> THAT IGNITED THE GUNPOWDER,</i> <i> WERE A CIVIL-WAR TECHNOLOGY.</i> SO IS THIS A MILITARY DEVICE, THEN? I DON'T THINK IT IS, BECAUSE IT'S NOT MARKED, AND A LOT OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT AT THAT TIME DID HAVE MARKINGS. THE OTHER THING IS THAT THE COLLAR ON THE NIPPLE IS DIFFERENT THAN ON MILITARY WEAPONS OF THAT TIME PERIOD. LET ME SHOW YOU. WE HAVE HERE A CIVIL-WAR WEAPON THAT WAS MADE AT WATERTOWN ARSENAL, AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS ITEM THAT WE HAVE HAS A SQRE COLLAR. <i> IT'S A TINY DETAIL, BUT KRIS</i> <i> EXPLAINS THAT THE U.S. MILITARY</i> <i> ROUTINELY USED SQUARE COLLARS</i> <i> ON PERCUSSION WEAPONS.</i> <i> OUR COLLAR IS RECTANGULAR.</i> <i> I ASK KRIS IF SHE THINKS</i> <i> THERE'S ANYTHING</i> <i> TO WARREN'S IDEA</i> <i> THAT THE DEVICE WAS DESIGNED</i> <i> TO DETER GRAVE ROBBERS.</i> THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING, BUT I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THAT BEFORE. <i> AND IF THIS HAD BEEN BURIED,</i> <i> KRIS SPOTS WHAT APPEARS TO BE</i> <i> A FATAL FLAW</i> <i> IN THE DESIGN</i> <i> OF OUR TORPEDO.</i> THE OTHER PROBLEM IS, ONCE YOU BURIED IT, YOU'D HAVE DIRT IN HERE, AND THEN HOW WOULD THE HAMMER HIT THE PERCUSSION CAP THAT'S ON THE NIPPLE TO CREATE THE EXPLOSION? BUT IT'S DEFINITELY PROFESSIONALLY MADE, SO IT HAS TO HAVE SOME KIND OF PRACTICAL USE. YOU KNOW, IF OUR DEVICE REALLY WAS MEANT TO DETER GRAVE ROBBERS, THERE'S GOTO BE SOME ACCOUNT OF ONE OF THESE GOING OFF. <i> I TRY SEARCHING ONLINE</i> <i> TO SEE WHAT I CAN FIND</i> <i> ABOUT GRAVE ALARMS.</i> <i> I DON'T TURN ANYTHING UP</i> <i> SEARCHING UNDER GRAVE ALARMS,</i> <i> BUT GRAVE TORPEDO,</i> <i> WHICH IS THE TERM KRIS USED,</i> <i> RETURNS A CURIOUS HIT.</i> OKAY, HERE'S AN ARTICLE FROM THE<i> RICHWOOD GAZETTE,</i> 1881 IN OHIO: GRAVE ROBBER KILLED. THREE MEN WHO ATTEMPTED TO ROB A GRAVE NEAR GANN, IN KNOX COUNTY, OHIO, MET WITH A HORRIBLE OBSTACLE. WHEN NEARING THE COFFIN, THEY STRUCK A TORPEDO. SO THESE THINGS REALLY DID EXIST. <i> ONE OF THESE DEVICES,</i> <i> PATENTED IN 1881,</i> <i> SOUNDS SIMILAR</i> <i> TO OURS.</i> THOMAS HOWELL OF CIRCLEVILLE, OHIO, PATENTED AN EXPLODING SHELL THAT WAS BURIED RIGHT ABOVE A COFFIN. AND IF ROBBERS TRIED TO DIG UP THE COFFIN, THE SHELL WOULD EXPLODE, INJURING OR KILLING THE THIEVES. <i> IT APPEARS THAT IN THESE CASES,</i> <i> AT LEAST, THE GRAVE ROBBERS</i> <i> WEREN'T TRYING TO SWIPE JEWELRY</i> <i> AND OTHER VALUABLES,</i> <i> THEY WERE TRYING</i> <i> TO STEAL BODIES.</i> IT SAYS THAT DURING THE 1800s, MEDICAL SCHOOLS STOLE CADAVERS TO DEMONSTRATE GROSS ANATOMY TO THE STUDENTS AND THAT THIS WAS PARTICULARLY A PROBLEM IN OHIO. <i> SCOTT GAMPHER IS THE DIRECTOR</i> <i> OF HISTORY COLLECTIONS</i> <i> AT THE CINCINNATI MUSEUM CENTER</i> <i> AT UNION TERMINAL.</i> <i> HE'S NEVER SEEN</i> <i> ANYTHING LIKE OUR DEVICE,</i> <i> BUT HE UNDERSTANDS THE HISTORIC</i> <i> NEED TO PREVENT BODY SNATCHING.</i> THERE WERE A LOT OF DISSECTIONS THAT WERE TAKING PLACE IN THESE MEDICAL COLLEGES, AND THUS A NEED FOR A LOT OF CADAVERS. <i> BETWEEN 1865 AND 1890,</i> <i> THE NUMBER OF MEDICAL SCHOOLS</i> <i> IN THE U.S. ALMOST DOUBLED.</i> <i> CINCINNATI-AREA MEDICAL SCHOOLS</i> <i> COMPETED WITH EACH OTHER</i> <i> TO OFFER PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE</i> <i> TO STUDENTS.</i> <i> BUT BODIES WERE NOT</i> <i> EASY TO COME BY:</i> <i> THE CHURCH OBJECTED,</i> <i> AND MANY STATES</i> <i> ONLY PERMITTED THE BODIES</i> <i> OF EXECUTED CRIMINALS</i> <i> TO BE USED FOR DISSECTION.</i> AND SO, REALLY, THE ONLY AVENUE FOR THESE SCHOOLS TO OBTAIN CADAVERS WAS THROUGH THE BLACK MARKET. IN OTHER WORDS, BY DOING BUSINESS WITH GRAVE ROBBERS. <i> IN THE 1870s, PUBLIC CONCERN</i> <i> ABOUT BODY SNATCHING</i> <i> WAS AT A FEVER PITCH</i> <i> IN OHIO IN PARTICULAR</i> <i> BECAUSE OF</i> <i> A NOTORIOUS INCIDENT.</i> <i> THE BODY OF</i> <i> JOHN SCOTT HARRISON,</i> <i> FATHER OF FUTURE PRESIDENT</i> <i> BENJAMINM A ROPE</i> <i> DOWN A DARK SHAFT</i> <i> AT THE MEDICAL COLLEGE OF OHIO,</i> <i> PROVOKING ENORMOUS OUTRAGE.</i> IT WAS PARTICULARLY BAD BECAUSE MEASURES HAD BEEN TAKEN BY THE HARRISON FAMILY TO PREVENT THIS VERY THING FROM HAPPENING. <i> SCOTT SHOWS ME</i> <i> AN ARTICLE</i> <i> FROM THE</i> CINCINNATI DAILY COMMERCIAL <i> WRITTEN IN 1878 JUST AFTER</i> <i> HARRISON'S BODY WAS STOLEN.</i> IF CEMENTED WALLS CAREFULLY AND SKILLFULLY CONSTRUCTED, AND VAST WEIGHTS, REQUIRING THE STRENGTH OF MANY MEN TO LIFT, AND HIRED AND PRE-PAID WATCHMEN COULD NOT SAVE THEIR LOVED AND HONORED PARENT'S GRAVE FROM DESECRATION AND DISHONOR, WHAT COULD? WOW. AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SHOCKED THE PUBLIC SO MUCH: WELL, IF IT COULD HAPPEN TO THE HARRISONS, IT COULD HAPPEN TO ANYBODY. <i> THE PUBLIC HAD</i> <i> RUN OUT OF WAYS</i> <i> TO SECURE</i> <i> THEIR LOVED ONE'S GRAVE,</i> <i> SO THEY TURNED TO DEADLY</i> <i> EXPLOSIVES AS A LAST RESORT.</i> <i> BUT IS OUR DEVICE REALLY</i> <i> ONE OF THESE TORPEDOES?</i> <i> WITHOUT A MAKER'S MARK</i> <i> OR A CLEAR EXPLANATION</i> <i> FOR HOW IT MIGHT'VE WORKED,</i> <i> I'M STILL NOT SURE</i> <i> WHAT WE HAVE.</i> <i> SCOTT PUT ME IN CONTACT</i> <i> WITH PAUL MAYBERRY,</i> <i> THE LOCAL HISTORIAN</i> <i> OF PICKAWAY COUNTY, OHIO.</i> <i> PICKAWAY INCLUDES</i> <i> THE TOWN OF CIRCLEVILLE,</i> <i> WHERE THOMAS HOWELL</i> <i> INVENTED HIS TORPEDO.</i> MY RESEARCH LED ME TO CIRCLEVILLE BECAUSE OF THIS OBJECT. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS? WELL, THAT'S REALLY SOMETHING. <i> PAUL HAS NEVER SEEN</i> <i> ONE OF THESE BEFORE,</i> <i> BUT HE SAYS GRAVE TORPEDOES</i> <i> HAVE A LONG HISTORY</i> <i> IN THE REGION.</i> OUR LOCAL CEMETERY ABOLISHED THE USE OF THEM, I THINK, IN 1890 BECAUSE IT WAS TOO MUCH OF A DANGER TO THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WORKING IN THE CEMETERY. SUPPOSEDLY THERE WAS A GUY NAMED THOMAS HOWELL WHO LIVED HERE IN CIRCLEVILLE WHO MADE DEVICES LIKE THIS. HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF HOWELL? YES, I HAVE. I'VE DONE SOME RESEARCH ON THOMAS HOWELL. HE WAS A WATCH MAKER AND TIMES GOT A LITTLE TOUGH FOR HIM, AND HE DECIDED TO RESOLVE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WE HAD WITH GRAVE ROBBING. <i> PAUL ASSEMBLED A NUMBER</i> <i> OF LOCAL ARTICLES ON HOWELL</i> <i> THAT HE COPIED</i> <i> FROM OLD NEWSPAPERS.</i> THIS IS SOME OF THE ADVERTISING THAT HE DID. SO IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S FROM THE NEWSPAPER FROM JULY 11, 1879. THE AD SAYS, SLEEP WELL, SWEET ANGEL. LET NO FEARS OF GHOULS DISTURB THY REST, FOR ABOVE THY SHROUDED FORM LIES A TORPEDO, READY TO MAKE MINCE-MEAT OF ANYONE WHO ATTEMPTS TO CONVEY YOU TO THE PICKLING VAT. WOW, THAT IS INCREDIBLE! I MEAN, THAT'S PRETTY GOOD DIRECT MARKETING, ISN'T IT? IT IS. <i> BUT THE PICTURE OF HOWELL'S</i> <i> GRAVE TORPEDO</i> <i> LOOKS NOTHING LIKE OURS.</i> <i> DO WE HAVE</i> <i> A GRAVE TORPEDO?</i> <i> AND HOW WOULD IT HAVE WORKED?</i> HERE'S THE PROBLEM THAT I HAVE. IF YOU SET THIS THING AND YOU PUT IT INTO A GRAVE, WHAT'S TO PREVENT IT FROM EXPLODING IN YOUR FACE? WELL, THIS IS AN INGENIOUS DEVICE. <i> WHAT PAUL SHOWS ME NEXT</i> <i> GIVES ME THE ANSWER I NEED</i> <i> FOR WARREN.</i> WHEN YOU FIRST SHOWED ME THIS THING AND YOU THOUGHT IT WAS SOME SORT OF A GRAVE ALARM, I SAID, COME ON, THIS GUY'S CRAZY! IT COULDN'T BE A GRAVE ALARM. BUT AS I GOT INTO THE INVESTIGATION, I DISCOVERED THAT THIS IS NOT SO MUCH AN ALARM AS IT IS A DEADLY WEAPON. OH, YEAH? <i> I TELL HENRY</i> <i> THAT HIS DEVICE WAS DESIGNED</i> <i> TO DETER THIEVES STEALING</i> <i> BODIES, NOT VALUABLES.</i> WELL, THE GUYS I TALKED TO WERE HALF RIGHT, ANYWAY. HERE'S THE THING I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT: HOW COULD YOU PUT THIS INTO A GRAVE, SET THE TRIGGERS, AND FILL THE GRAVE UP WITHOUT BLOWING YOUR HEAD OFF? YOU GOT ME IN SUSPENSE HERE! THOMAS HOWELL WAS SO SUCCESSFUL WITH HIS FIRST GRAVE TORPEDO THAT HE DESIGNED ANOTHER ONE, AND I HAVE A PATENT FOR THAT ONE HERE. NO, REALLY? GRAVE TORPEDO, DECEMBER 20, 1881. <i> THE OLD PATENT PAPERS</i> <i> SHOW A CURIOUS PARABOLA,</i> <i> OR ARC, OVER THE TOP</i> <i> OF OUR TORPEDO,</i> <i> AND SUDDENLY I UNDERSTAND HOW</i> <i> OUR DEVICE IS SUPPOSED TO WORK.</i> WHAT'S MISSING FROM HERE IS A THIN METAL SHIELD THAT FIT OVER THIS THAT HAD A HOLE IN THE MIDDLE... RIGHT. THAT ACCORDING TO THE PATENT PAPERS, YOU'D TAKE A LONG TUBE, LIKE A STANDPIPE, YOU'D PUT A FUNNEL UP AT THE TOP, AFTER THIS IS BURIED IN THE GRAVE... CORRECT. AND YOU'D FILL THIS CHAMBER UP WITH GUNPOWDER. THEN ONCE THE CHAMBER'S FILLED UP, YOU'D DROP A CORK DOWN THE STANDPIPE, OR SOME STOPPER. <i> WHEN THE TRIPWIRES SECURED</i> <i> TO THE COLLAR</i> <i> ARE DISTURBED</i> <i> BY A GRAVE ROBBER...</i> THE THING GOES KA-BOOM! WOW, I WOULD SAY THAT'S THE SAME DEVICE. <i> BECAUSE HIS DEVICE</i> <i> HAS NO MARKINGS ON IT</i> <i> AND BECAUSE IT'S NOT</i> <i> AN EXACT MATCH,</i> <i> HENRY MAY HAVE A PROTOTYPE</i> <i> OF HOWELL'S PATENTED</i> <i> GRAVE TORPEDO.</i> IT'S SO CLOSE THAT IT'S GOT TO BE IT. IT'S GOT TO BE. YOU GUYS REALLY DID A JOB ON THIS. THIS IS WORTH KNOWING. THIS IS -
- I MEAN, THIS IS HISTORY. WELL, THIS HAS BEEN A GREAT INVESTIGATION, AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS TO ME. YOU'RE RIGHT ON THE BALL, WES. PUT 'ER THERE, PAL. <i> IN 1881, THE YEAR HOWELL'S</i> <i> GRAVE TORPEDO WAS PATENTED,</i> <i> OHIO ENACTED</i> <i> THE ANATOMY LAW.</i> <i> IT PERMITTED MEDICAL SCHOOLS</i> <i> TO USE UNCLAIMED BODIES</i> <i> FROM PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS.</i> <i> BY THE TURN OF THE CENTURY,</i> <i> BODY SNATCHING CASES</i> <i> HAD SIGNIFICANTLY DECLINED.</i> <i> CADAVER STORAGE AND</i> <i> PRESERVATION IMPROVED,</i> <i> ALLOWING SCHOOLS</i> <i> TO ACCUMULATE BODIES,</i> <i> AND THE NEED FOR STEALING</i> <i> FRESH HUMAN CORPSES</i> <i> WAS A THING OF THE PAST.</i> EVEN PRESIDENTIAL BURIAL SITES WERE PREY FOR GRAVE ROBBERS. ELEVEN YEARS AFTER ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S ASSASSINATION, A CRIMINAL GANG HATCHED A PLOT TO RANSOM HIS CORPSE. THEY WANTED $200,000 AND THE RELEASE OF AN IMPRISONED COHORT. ON ELECTION NIGHT 1876, THE THIEVES RAIDED LINCOLN'S TOMB IN SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS. BUT THE 500-POUND CEDAR AND LEAD COFFIN WAS TOO HEAVY TO MOVE. TIPPED-OFF SECRET SERVICE AGENTS ARRIVED IN TIME TO CATCH THE WOULD-BE GRAVE ROBBERS IN THE ACT. AFTER THE ATTEMPTED ROBBERY, THE NATIONAL LINCOLN MONUMENT SOCIETY SECRETLY MOVED LINCOLN'S CORPSE TO ANOTHER PART OF THE TOMB. FOR YEARS, THE PUBLIC PAID THEIR RESPECTS TO AN EMPTY SARCOPHAGUS. BEFORE LINCOLN'S BODY WAS LAID TO ITS FINAL RESTING PLACE, IT WAS EXHUMED AND CHECKED TWICE TO MAKE SURE THE CORPSE WAS STILL THERE. AS A LAST SAFETY MEASURE, IN 1901, PRESIDENT AND MRS. LINCOLN'S BODIES WERE ENCASED IN LEAD. THEIR COFFINS WERE CAGED IN STEEL AND BURIED BENEATH 10 FEET OF CEMENT, ENSURING THAT LINCOLN WOULD STAY IN SPRINGFIELD FOREVER.
