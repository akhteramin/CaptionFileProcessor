 HEY, GOOD EVENING. WELCOME BACK TO NEW HAMPSHIRE.
 I'MANDERSON COOPER.
 CNN PARTNERED WITH THE HARVARD
 UNIVERSITY WITH THE NEW
 HAMPSHIRE INSTITUTE OF POLITICS
 IN MANCHESTER.■>■>■>
 ERHE CANDIDATES ARE TAKING QUES
 YOUNG ADULTS WHO PLAN TO VOTE IN
 THEY'RE STATE'S DEMOCRATIC
 PRIMARY.
 YOU'VE HEARD FROM FOUR OF THE
 TOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES.
 BUN BERNIE SANDERS, KAMALA
 HARRIS.
 NOW IT IS MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIE
 GERKS'S TURN.
 HE'S SKY ROCKETED TO THE TOP
 TIER OF THE DEMOCRATIC FIELD.
 HE WAS THE STUDENT PRESIDENT OF
 THE HARVARD SCHOOL OF POLITICS
 WHILE HE WAS AN UNDERGRADUATE.
 BUT HE HAD NO ROLE IN ORGANIZING
 THIS EVENT.
 PLEASE WELCOME MAYOR BUTTI GERKS
 IEG.
 WELCOME.
 GOOD TO SEE YOU.
 ALL RIGHT.
 SO GET RIGHT TO IT.
 LET'S DO IT.
 FIRST QUESTION FROM A
 FRESHMAN IN IDAHO.
 THANK YOU, MAYOR, FOR TAKING
 MY QUESTION.
 TREVOR NOAH SAID YOU WERE THE
 EXACT OPPOSITE OF TRUMP IN MANY
 REGARDS.
 GOING SO FAR AS TO SAY YOU WERE
 THE ANTITRUMP.
 HOWEVER, SIMILARER TO TRUMP YOU
 LACK EXPERIENCE.
 HOW WOULD YOU USE THIS AS AN
 ADVANTAGE?
 IN MANY WAYS EXPERIENCE IS MY
 ANSWERER TO THE QUESTION OF AGE.
 I GET MY EXPERIENCE IS NOT THE
 MOST CONVENTIONAL BUT UNLIKE
 THIS PRESIDENT I HAVE EXPERIENCE
 IN GOVERNMENT, AS I OFTEN POINT
 OUT.
 I GOT NOT ONLY MORE EXPERIENCE
 IN GOVERNMENT THAN THE PRESIDENT
 BUT MORE EXECUTIVE EXPERIENCE
 THAN THE VICE PRESIDENT, MORE
 MILITARY EXPERIENCE THAN ANYBODY
 IN THE OFFICE SINCE GEORGE H.W.
 BUSH.
 AND FRANKLY THE LACK OF ACTION
 THAT'S HAPPENED ON ISSUES FROM
 CLIMATE TO COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY
 TO MAKING SURE THAT WE DO
 SOMETHING ABOUT THE FISCAL
 SUSTAINABILITY OF THIS COUNTRY.
 LOOK, EVERYONE COMING INTO THE
 OFFICE BRINGS THE COMBINATION OF
 LIFE AND PROFESSIONAL
 EXPERIENCES THAT THEY HAVE PLUS
 THEIR VALUES.
 BUT I WOULD ARGUE IT DOESN'T GET
 VERY MUCH MORER DIFFERENT.
 IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO BE
 DIFFERENT FROM THIS PRESIDENT.
 AND I THINK WE NEED A LILT MORE
 OF THAT LOCAL PERSPECTIVE.
 WHEN I WAS HANGING AROUND, I
 DIDN'T THINK A LOT ABOUT LOCAL
 GOVERNMENT.
 IT WAS USUALLY IN THE PHRASE
 STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT.
 ALMOST LIKE THEY WERE ONE WORD.
 AND ALL I REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT
 WAS FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
 BUT WHAT I FOUND IS THERE'S SO
 MUCH PURPOSES, SO MUCH MEANING.
 AND SO MUCH ACTUAL PROBLEM
 SOLVING THAT HAPPENS AT THE
 LOCAL LEVEL.
 YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE A CITY
 GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN BECAUSE OFF
 A DISAGREEMENT OVER POLICY.
 IF I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH OUR
 COUNSEL, IT WOULD NEVER LEAD TO
 THE CITY SHUTTING DOWN BECAUSE
 WE'DER DELIVER WATERER.
 SO WE SIMPLY FIGURED IT OUT AND
 NOW I THINK WE NEED THAT SAME
 ATTITUDE TO MAKE ITS WAY INTO
 FEDERAL POLITICS BEFORE IT
 STARTS HAPPENING THE OTHER WAY
 AROUND.
 YOUR CAMPAIGN WEBSITE HAS GOT
 A LOT ABOUT WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN,
 YOU YOU ARE.
 IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING
 SPECIFIC ABOUT POLICY.
 NOTHING.
 NO POLICY SECTION ON IT.
 AT WHAT POINT DO YOU NEED TO
 START PRESENTING SPECIFIC
 POLICIES?
 I THINK I'VE BEEN PRETTY
 CLEAR WHERE I STAND ON MAJOR
 ISSUES.
 I THINK I LED THE FIELD ON
 OPENING THE DEBATE FOR
 STRUCTURAL REFORM.
 I'D SAY I'VE BEEN MORER SPECIFIC
 THAN MANY VERSES JUST SAYING WE
 CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN.
 AND THERE'S A TOOL COMING ONLINE
 SHORTLY THAT WILL MAKE IT
 POSSIBLE TO JUST ENTER A KEY
 WORD AND SEE, VISUALIZE, PULL
 ALL THE VIDEO ON WHAT I'VE SAID
 ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE.
 WE'LL CONTINUE TO ROLL OUT
 SPECIFIC POLICY PROPOSALS TOO.
 BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE
 DON'T DROWN PEOPLE BEFORE WE'VE
 VINDICATED THE VALUES THAT AN
 MATE OUR POLICIES.
 WE GO RIGHT TO THE POLICY
 PROPOSALS AND WE EXPECT PEOPLE
 TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT
 RUR VALUES MUST BE FROM THAT.
 I EXPECT IT WILL BE VERY EASY TO
 TELL WHERE I STAND ON ISSUES OF
 OUR TIME.
 BUT I'M GOING TO TAKE TIME LAY
 THAT OUT, RATHER THAN COMPETING
 STRICTLY ON THE THEORETICAL
 ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSALS
 THEMSELVES.
 BUT IT'S HARD TO COMPARE TO,
 LET'S SAY ELIZABETH WARREN WHO'S
 OUT HERE.
 IT'S NOT -YOU CAN'T COMPARE
 POLICY POSITIONS.
 SOME OF THAT WILL COME OUT
 TONIGHT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO
 THAT.
 I THINK I'VE WEIGHED IN PRETTY
 SPECIFICALLY.
 WE'RE IN THE SECOND WEEK OF MY
 CAMPAIGN BEING OFFICIAL AND
 WE'LL CONTINUE BUILDING OUR
 WEBSITE ACCORDINGLY TOO.
 HANNAH IS A SOPHOMORE AT
 BOSTON UNIVERSITY STUDYING
 JOURNALISM FROM CALIFORNIA.
 YOU'VE SAID IN PAST
 INTERVIEWS YOU BELIEVE LARGE
 CORPORATIONS ARE THE BIGGEST
 CHALLENGE FACING AMERICA.
 WHAT SPECIFICALLY IS YOUR PLAN
 IF YOU BELIEVE TYOU'D LIKE TO
 BREAK UP THESE CORPORATIONS,
 WHAT LEGISLATIVE ACTION WOULD
 YOU TYKE DO SO?
 THERE'S SEVERAL PROBLEMS IN
 OUR RELATIONSHIP TO OUR
 DEMOCRACY.
 THE WAY CONCENTRATIONS OF WEALTH
 AND CORPORATE POWER HAVE TURNED
 INTO CONCENTRATIONS OF POLITICAL
 POWER AND ONE OF THE REASONS
 NEED ACT QUICK 3 ESTABLISH THAT
 CORPORATIONS DO NOT EQUAL PEOPLE
 AND MONEY DOES NOT EQUAL SPEECH.
 SOME HAVE SAID IN THE FRAMEWORK
 OF THE CONSTITUTION, YOU CAN'T
 FRAME THOSE BOUNDARIES AND THAT
 LEAD TO A DECISION I THINK HAS
 BEEN DISASTROUS FOR OUR
 POLITICS.
 I DON'T BELIEVE THE CONSTITUTION
 SAYS THAT.
 BUT IF THAT'S GOING TO BE THE
 DIRECTION THAT OUR FEDERAL
 JUDICIARY TAKES GOING FORWARD,
 THEN I THINK IT'S NECESSARY TO
 FORMER A CONSTITUTIONAL
 AMENDMENT AND I'M UNDER NO
 ILLUSION IT'S POSSIBLE OVERNIGHT
 GET THAT REFORM.
 BUT I THINK MOST AMERICANS AGREE
 WE NEED TO GET MONEY OUT OF
 POLITICS.
 THERE'S ISSUES WITH THE SHEER
 AGLOMERATION OF DIFFERENT
 BUSINESS INTERESTS INTO SINGLE
 CORPORATIONS.
 BUT PART OF HOW WE REGULATE THAT
 IS ACCORDING TO WHETHER THEY'RE
 BEHAVING IN AN ANTICOMPETITIVE
 FASHION.
 ANTITRUST LAW HAS BEGUN TO HIT
 ITS LIMITS WITH REGULATING TECH
 COMPANIES.
 IT WAS ALWAYS BASED AROUND THE
 IDEA THAT THE REASON YOU GOT TO
 STOP MONOPOLIES FROM HAPPENING
 IS YOU GOT TO JACK UP PRICES.
 THAT FRAME WORK MADE A LOT OF
 SENSE THAT RAILROADS  KAEBT ABU
 THE SYSTEM.
 THE PRODUCT IS MADE FREE, OR AT
 LEAST IT'S FREE ON ITS FACE.
 WE'VE LEARNED IN PART BECAUSE OF
 THE WAY OUR DATA ARE USED BY
 THESE COMPANIES, THAT NOTHING IS
 ACTUALLY FREE.
 SO WEIR ARGOING TO NEED EMPOWER
 THE FTC TO INTERVENE, INCLUDING
 BLOCKING MERGERS WHERE THERE'S
 ANTICOMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR BY TECH
 COMPANIES, EVEN IF IT CAN'T
 DIRECTLY BE APPLIED TO PRICING
 BECAUSE YOUR NOT SEEING IT
 BECAUSE IT'S FREE.
 A SOPHOMORE STUDYING SOCIALGY
 AND CHEMISTRY.
 THERE ARE ABOUT 1100 OTHERS
 THAT ARE NOT ADDRESSED.
 HOW DO YOU ASS A
 COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION
 REFORM?
 I THINK REASON THE DREAMER
 STORY IS SO POWERFUL IS IT
 REFLECTS THE EXPERIENCES OF
 PEOPLE WHO ARE AMERICANS.
 THEY'RE NOT U.S. CITIZENS BUT IN
 MANY CASES THIS A IS THE ONLY
 COUNTRY THEY CAN EVEN REMEMBER
 BECAUSE THEY CAME HERE THROUGH
 NO CHOICE OF THEIR OWN AND IT'S
 ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THERE'S A
 BROAD U.S. CONSENSUS THAT WE
 NEED FIND A WAY TO PROTECT
 DREAMSERS.
 THERE ARE OVER 10 MILLION PEOPLE
 WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS
 IN THIS COUNTRY WHO DON'T FALL
 INTO THAT CATEGORY.
 THE REALITY IS WE CAN'T HAVE
 COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM
 THAT WIRKS UNLESS IT ADDRESSES
 THE STATUS FOR THOSE 11 SOME
 MILLION UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS.
 WE NEED MAKE SURE THERE'S A
 PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP FOR THEM
 TOO.
 THERE'S ACTUALLY AN AMERICAN
 CONSENSUS OF WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED
 TO DO.
 READERSHIP IS SUPPOSED TO BE
 ABOUT TAKING ISSUES THAT ARE
 DIVISIVE.
 BUT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE AN ISSUE
 WHERE THERE'S A PRETTY BROAD
 CONSENSUS AND IT'S BEEN USED TO
 DIVIDE US.
 IT'S A REMARKABLE FEET OF
 WHATEVER THE OPPOSITE OF
 LEADERSHIP IS.
 AND YOU CAN SEE IT BECAUSE THERE
 HAVE BEEN HEALTHY COMPROMISES,
 BIPARTISAN IMMIGRATION REFORM
 THAT HAVE PASSED IN ONE CHAMBER
 IN WASHINGTON, OWN 3 DIE IN THE
 OTHERS.
 THE LAST TIME WE EHAD A FULL,
 MEANINGFUL COMPREHENSIVE REFORM
 WAS 1984 AUTHORED BY RON IZOLI
 AND BACK WHEN I WAS AN UNDERGRAD
 WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW HAS IT
 BEEN THIS LONG?
 AND NOW IT'S BEEN JUST AS LONG
 OR ALMOST SINCE THEN.
 WE KNOW THE OUTLINES.
 A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP FOR
 UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE IN THIS
 COUNTRY.
 A LEVEL OF PROTECTION FOR
 DREAMERS.
 A SET OF REFORMS TO CLEAR UP THE
 BUREAUCRACY AND THE BACK LOGS IN
 THE LAWFUL IMMIGRATION SYSTEM,
 WHICH IS HOW MY FATHER CAME TO
 THE COUNTRY AND BECAME A U.S.
 CITIZEN AND REASONABLE MEASURES
 ON BORDER SECURITY.
 WE KNOW WHAT TO DO.
 IT'S JUST THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE
 LEADERSHIP IN WASHINGTON TO DO
 IT.
 AND I'M AFRAID ONE OF THE
 REASONS IS WE VEA WHITE HOUSE
 THAT'S COMPUTED IT'S BETTER OFF
 POLITICALLY THAT AMERICANS
 CONTINUE TO BE DIVIDED A IT
 FOR BCBC POLITICAL GAIN
 AND THAT HAS GOT TO END WITH A
 NEW PRESIDENT.
 IF INDIANA ALLOWED IT, WOULD
 YOU SUPPORT SOUTH BEND BEING A
 SANCTUARY CITY?
 ONE OF THE THINGS YOV RR
 NOTICED BECAUSE WE WERE TRYING
 TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THIS MEANT
 WHEN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
 WAS THREATENING MAYORS WITH
 DRAWING OUR GRANT AND JAG FUNDS
 FOR THE POLICE EDEPARTMENT BASED
 ON WHETHER WE WERE A SANCTUARY
 CITY.
 THEY COULDN'T TELL US WHAT THAT
 MEANS.
 ER I REGAD US AS A WELCOMING
 CITY.
 ER SOME CONSERVATIVE TALK SHOW
 HOST MAY SAY THAT MAKES US A
 SANCTUARY CITY.
 WE MAKE IT VERY CLEAR OUR SOUTH
 BEND POLICE DEPARTMENT IS NOT
 RESPONSIBLE FOR ENFORCING
 IMMIGRATION POLICY.
 MORE THAN A ENOUGH TO WORRY
 ABOUT AND IT'S HARDER FOR THEM
 TO DO THEIR JOB IF RESIDENTS,
 MANY OF WHOM ARE IMMIGRANTS, AND
 SOME UNDOCUMENTED, ARE AFRAID TO
 TALK TO THEM, EVEN IF THEY KNOW
 SOMETHINGX THAT MIGHT HELP THEM
 ADDRESS A CRIME BECAUSE THEY'VE
 BEEN LED TO BELIEVE THAT OUR
 LO
 LOCLAW ENFORCEMENT ARE BEING
 CONSTRICTED SOMEHOW INTO DOING
 THE JOB OF FEDERAL IMMIGRATION
 AUTHORITIES.
 THAT'S OUR POLICY.
 WE'RE A WELCOMING CITY AND I
 GUESS THE PRESIDENT THINKS
 AMERICA IS FULL.
 YEAR NOT.
 I WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO HAVE
 MORE PEOPLE.
 WE ONLY HAVE 1HUNG,000 BECAUSE
 SO MANY PEOPLE LEFT AFTER THE
 AUTO COMPANIES COLLAPSED.
 WE GOT PLENTY OF ROOM FOR
 RESIDENTS AND TAXPAYERERS.
 AND LET US NOT FORGET THAT IN
 MANY RESPECTS FROM PROPERTY
 TACKS TO SALES TAXES
 UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS ARE
 TAXPAYERERS AND THE TRUTH IS, IN
 MANY RESPEKCTS, THEY'RE
 SUBSIDIZING THE REST OF US.
 WHICH IS ONE MORE REASON WE GOT
 TO GET SORTED OUT.
 YOU GOT ONE MORE QUESTION?
 THIS IS A FRESHMAN FROM HARVARD.
 PRETTY CLOSE TO SOUTH BEND.
 I'M FROM SMALL MIDWESTERN TOWN
 THAT'S BEEN EFFECTED BY THE POST
 INDUSTRIAL SITUATION.
 IN A INTERVIEW WITH DAVID
 AXELROD, YOU NOTED NAFTA
 RESULTED IN LOSSES ACROSS THE
 MIDWEST.
 HOW WOULD YOUR ADMINISTRATION
 BRING SUCCESS?
 IT'S CLOSE TO MY HEART
 BECAUSE IT'S CLOSE TO MY HOME
 TOWN.
 AND DURING THE CHRYSLER PARTIAL
 SHUTDOWN, WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN
 AND AROUND HOWARD COUNTY WAS AN
 EXAMPLE OF HOW VULNERABLE OUR
 COMMUNITIES ARE TO OUR POLICIES
 AND MARKETS WHEN IT COMES TO
 MANUFACTURING.
 SO WE NEED FIND A WAY TO MAKE
 SURE TRADE WORKS FOR US.
 THERE'S NO BUILDING A WALL
 AROUND THE STATUS QUO.
 DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY.
 BUT WHAT WE DO NEED TO MAKE SURE
 OF IS IT THERE'S ENOUGH MESHES
 INCLUDING ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE,
 INCLUDING MAKING SURE WE MAKE
 WHOLE IN SOME WAY, THAT WE'RE
 ACTUALLY KEEPING THE PROMISE OF
 TRADE.
 THE PROMISE MADE WHEN I WAS
 GROWING UP IS IF WE DID THESE
 THINGS, THE RISING TIDE WOULD
 LIFT ANDL BE BETTER
 OFF.
 THE RISING TIDE ROSE.
 IT'S JUST A LOT OF THE BOATS
 TURNED OUT TO BE ANCHORERED TO
 THE OCEAN FLOOR.
 BUT WE CAN MAKE TRADE WORK FOR
 OUR COMMUNITIES. UAW FACILITY IN
 ST
 ST. JOSEPHF COUNTY THAT IS
 MAKING VEHICLES WHERE THE FUNDS
 AND INVESTMENT CAME FROM CHINA
 AND BEFORE THAT, THERE WAS A
 THREE-YEAR CONTRACT WHERE THAT
 FACILITY WAS WORKING FOR
 MERCEDES AND THEY WERE MAKING
 VEHICLES SOLD IN THE ASIAN
 MARKET.
 SO AMERICAN UNION OUGHT SO
 WORKERS MAKING GERMAN CARS,
 GOING TO CHINESE CUSTOMERS AND
 WE'RE SENDING OUR -NOT OUR
 JOBS.
 IN MAKING SURE WE HAVE FAIR
 TRADE THAT WORKS IN COMMUNITIES
 LIKE WHERE WE COME FROM, FOR
 EVERY JOB TATS ARER BEEN LOST AS
 A CONSEQUENCE OF TRADE THERE,
 ARE SEVERAL MORE THAT HAVE BEEN
 LOST AS A RESULT OF TECHNOLOGY
 AND AUTOMATION.
 THAT FACILITY MAKING ELECTRIC
 VEHICLES, EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE
 PLANNING TO MAKE SOMETHING LIKE
 30ER TO 50,000 CARS, DOES IT
 WITH HUNDREDS, NOT THOUSANDS OR
 10S OF THOUSANDS THE WAY IT USED
 TO WORK WHEN SOUTH BEND WAS AN
 AUTOMOTIVE CENTER.
 SO MANUFACTURING CAN CONTINUE TO
 GROW STRONGER IN THIS COUNTRY.
 BUT IT'S GOING TO BE LESS AND
 LESS LABOR, LESS AND LESS HUMAN
 BEING ON THE FLOOR.
 AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED POLICIES
 THAT CAN GET AHEAD OF THE
 ECONOMIC SHIFTS TO COME AND
 RECOGNIZE OUR GENERATION'S NOT
 GOING TO BE ABLE TO COUNT AS OUR
 PARENT'S GENERATION OFTEN DID ON
 THE IDEA OF A SINGLE
 RELATIONSHIP OR A COUPLE
 EMPLOYERS ACROSS THE COURSE OF
 OF YOUR CAREER.
 KELSEY.
 HI, MAYOR.
 THE SCHOOL I ATTEND, UNIVERSITY
 OF NEW HAMPSHIRE, HAS ONE OF THE
 HIGHEST IN-STATE TUITION RATES
 FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY.
 HOW WOULD YOU WORK TO MAKE THE
 SO FUTURE STUDENTS WON'T HAVE TO
 DEAL WITH SUCH A FINANCIAL
 BURDEN?
 THIS IS A PERSONAL ISSUE FOR
 US BECAUSE WE LIVE WITH
 SIX-FIGURE STUDENT DEBT.
 IN PARTICULAR IN SPEAKING WITH
 STUDENTS AND POLICY MAKERS IN
 NEW HAMPSHIRE, I'VE LEARNED TO
 THE EXTENT THAT IN-STATE TUITION
 IS HIGHER THAN IT WOULD BE TO GO
 OUT OF STATE TO A LOT OF OTHER
 STATES, WHICH DEFEATS SO MUCH OF
 OF THE PURPOSE OF HAVING
 INSTITUTIONS THAT THERE SUPPOSED
 TO BUILD UP THE LIFE OF OUR
 STATE.
 MAKES IT THAT MUCH HARDER IF
 YOU'RE COMMITTED TO BEING PART
 OF THE COMMUNITY.
 ONE IN THE QUESTION THAT YOU
 RAISED IS THROUGH A COMBINATION
 OF CARROTS AND STICKS, WE'VE GOT
 TO INDUCE STATES TO CARRY MORE
 OF THE BURDEN, RATHER THAN PASS
 IT ON TO STUDENTS.
 STUDENTS ARE GETTING SQUEEZED
 BECAUSE STATES ARE LESS AND LESS
 WILLING TO MAKE SURE IT'S TRULY
 AFFORDABLE.
 ON THE BACK END WE'VE GOT TO
 WORK ON STUDENT LOAN DEBT.
 IF I CAN REFINANCE -WHEN RATES
 CHANGE, I CAN REFINANCE IT THE
 LOAN ON MY HOUSE.
 IT STANDS TO REASON THAT WE
 SHOULD DO THAT WITH STUDENT DEBT
 TOO.
 COUPLED WITH A SIGNIFICANT
 INCREASE IN PELGRANTS.
 AND THIS TIME LET'S PEG IT
 AUTOMATICALLY TO INFLATION SO WE
 DON'T HAVE TO ASK CONGRESS TO DO
 THAT AGAIN AND AGAIN.
 ELIZABETH WARREN RELEASED A
 PLAN THAT WOULD GIVE LOAN
 RETLEEF HOUSEHOLDS WITH 50,000
 LOAN CANCELLATIONS FOR FAMILIES
 EARNING LESS THAN 100,000 DLF.
  SHE SAYS IT WOULD COME FROM A
 2% TAX OF --
 I STILL WANT TO DO MATH
 AROUND IT.
 I FIND IT PRETTY APPEALING.
 I'M NOT AS CERTAIN I'M
 COMFORTABLE WITH PEOPLE THAT
 HIGH OF AN INCOME PARTICIPATING
 UNTIL WE HAVE A MORE PROGRESSIVE
 TAX CODE BECAUSE I NING YOU'RE
 NORTH OF $200,000, MAYBE YOU'RE
 TO THE POINT WE CAN ASK YOU TO
 TAKE CARE OF THE IT YOURSELF
 BEUTTHE THEORY OF IT MAKES
 SENSE.
 WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A BREAK.

 HERE WITH A SPECIAL CNN DEMOCRATIC TOWN HALL EVENT.
 WE'RE HERE WITH MAYORER PETE
 BUTTIGIEG.
 WE JUST CHECKED.
 THE POLICY PORTAL IS ONLINE
 SHOWING THE VIDEOS.
 I THOUGHT IT WAS BUT I WANTED
 TO MAKE SURE I WASN'T SAYING SO
 ON TELEVISION.
 YOU SAID AND I'M PARAPHRASING
 THAT ANGER AND DISSATISFACTION
 CAN LEAD THEM TO VOTE TO BLOW UP
 THE SYSTEM WHICH CAN LEAD TO
 SOMEBODY LIKE BERNIE SANDERS OR
 PRESIDENT TRUMP.
 THERE WERER A LOT OF HEADLINES
 AFTER THAT SAYING YOU WERE
 COMPARING BERNIE SANDERS TO
 PRESIDENT TRUMP?
 I REGARD THEM AS STUPENDOUSLY
 DIFFERENT IN MANY RESPECTS.
 BUT I THINK IT'S WORTH NOTING
 THERE IS SO MUCH
 ANTIESTABLISHMENT ENERGY AND
 THAT CAN FIND ITS WAY IN
 DIFFERENT POLITICAL DIRECTIONS.
 WHEN YOU THING OF OF THE NUMBER
 OF VOTERS WHO NARROWED DOWN
 THEIR CHOICES IN THE LAST
 ELECTION, EITHER TO BERNIE
 SANDERS OR DONALD TRUMP, IT
 TELLS YOU SOME OF THE MOST
 IMPORTANT THINGS ON VOTER'S
 MINDS AREN'T JUST ARE YOU CLOSE
 TO ME ON A LEFT/RIGHT POLITICAL
 SPECTRUM?
 BUT ARE YOU GOING TO PROFOUNDLY
 CHANGING THE SYSTEM YEAR LIVING
 IN?
 AND THE PRESIDENT, IT WAS ALL
 UNTRUE.
 YOU CAN SAY PRETTY MUCH
 ANYTHING ON CABLE.
 WELL, IT'S BULL.
 THERE WAS A SENSE I'M GOING TO
 BLOW UP THE SYSTEM.
 I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT TO
 UNDERSTAND BECAUSE WE NEED TO
 MAKE SURE WE, STRATEGICALLY AS A
 PARTY,ER THAT WE DON'T COME TO
 BE VIEWED AS DEFENDERS OOF THE
 SYSTEM THAT IS LETTING PEOPLE
 DOWN AND WE WOULDN'T BE NEAR THE
 ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SYSTEM
 HADN'T FAILED PEOPLE.
 AND THIS IS NOT JUST IN THE
 UNITED STATES BUT IN GENERAL.
 PEOPLE ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO
 MESSAGES AROUND HATE,
 XENOPHOBIA, RACISM.
 WHEN THEY FEEL OUT OF TOUCH WITH
 POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT THEY'RE IN
 OVERALL.
 AND WE BETTER PAY ATTENTION
 BECAUSE AS SOMEBODY WHO STUDIED
 COUNTERRADICALIZATION ABROAD,
 SOME OF THE SUPPORTS OF THIS
 PRESIDENT ARE ADOPTING MORE AND
 MORE EXTREME POSITIONS AND AS
 MAINSTREAM REPUBLICANS START
 LOOKING FOR SOME WAY OUT, IT
 GIVES YOU ALMOST NOWHERE TEELS
 GO.
 IF SOMEBODY'S VOTED DEMOCRAT
 AGAIN AND AGAIN RIGHT UP UNTIL
 2016 AND THEN VOTED FOR TRUMP, I
 WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT VOTER
 STARTS VOTING DEMOCRATIC.
 WE CAN'T JUST NIBBLE AROUND THE
 EDGES AND EXPECT PEOPLE TO BE
 HAPPY.
 I HAVE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT
 ACCOUNT THAN MY COMPETITORS.
 BUT THE LESSON IS IT'S BEEN
 LETTING PEOPLE DOWN, I WOULD SAY
 FOR MY ENTIRE LIFETIME.
 AND ONE OF THE REASONS WE'RE AT
 THIS TECTONIC MOMENT A ONCE IN
 EVERY HALF CENTURY OR SO MOMENT
 THERE'S A HINGE POINT BETWEEN
 ERAS IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
 AS BIG AS THE MOMENT WHEN THE
 NEW DEAL CAME ABOUT OR THE ONE
 WE'VE BEEN LIVING THROUGH EVER
 SINCE EWHEN REGANISM BECAME
 ASCENDANT IN THIS COUNTRY.
 THAT'S COME TO AN END AND WE'RE
 AT THE DAWN OF SOMETHING NEW AND
 IT COULD BE ENLIGHTENED
 FANTASTIC OR CAN BE UGLY.
 AND AS MUCH AS I CARE ABOUT
 REPLACING THIS PRESIDENT AND
 WINNING THIS ELECTION, WHALT'S T
 STAKE IS NOT JUST WINNING AN
 ELECTION BUT AN ERA.
 BERNIE SANDERS SAID HE'S IN
 FAVOR OF FELONS BEING ABLE TO
 VOTE, EVEN WHILE SERVING THEIR
 TERMS.
 AND PEOPLE PED FILES -HE SAID
 IT'S INHERENT TO THE RIGHT FOR
 DEMOCRACY, YES, FOR ALL PEOPLE.
 SHTD PEOPLE CONVICTED OF SEXUAL
 ASSAULT, SHOULD THEY BE ABLE TO
 ■TED?
 YES.
 NO.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 I DO BELIEVE THAT WHEN YOU HAVE
 SERVED YOUR SENTENCE, THEN PART
 OF BEING RESTORED TO SOCIETY IS
 THAT YOU ARE PART OF THE
 POLITICAL LIFE OF THIS NATION
 AGAIN AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT
 NEEDS TO BE RESTORED IS YOUR
 RIGHT TO VOTE.
 AS YOU KNOW SOME STATES AND
 COMMUNITIES TO DO IT.
 I THINK WE WOULD BE A BETTER
 COUNTRY EIF EVERYBODY DID IT AND
 I THINK THE MOTIVATIONS FOR
 PREVENTING THAT IN SOME CASES
 HAVE TO DO WITH ONE SIDE OF THE
 AISLE NOTICING THEY POLITICALLY
 BENEFIT AND THAT'S GOT RACIAL
 LAYERS TO IT.
 PART OF THE PUNISHMENT WHEN YOU
 WERE CONVICTED OFF A CRIME AND
 YOU'RE INCARCERATED IS YOU LOSE
 CERTAIN RIGHTS.
 YOU LOSE YOUR FREEDOM AND I
 THINK DURING THAT FREEDOM IT
 DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO HAVE AN
 EXCEPTION FOR IT THE RIGHT TO
 VOTE.
 WE HAVE A QUESTION FROM --
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 WE HAVE A QUESTION FROM EMILY
 BROTHER.
 SHE'S A SENIOR STUDYING MUSIC.
 THANK YOU FOR TAKING MY
 QUESTION.
 IN YOUR ■AUTOBIOGRAPHY "SHORTES
 WAY EHOME" YOU WERE PROUD OF
 SETTING AND ACHIEVING THE GOAL
 OF 1,000 VACANT OR ABANDONED
 HOUSES BULLDOZED.
 CAN YOU OFFER INSIGHT INTO WHAT
 YOU'VE SINCE LEARNED FROM THE
 RAMIFICATIONS AND CRITICISMS OF
 THIS PROJECT AND HOW THIS WOULD
 FORM YOU IN CRAFTING
 LEGISLATION?
 LET ME EXPLAIN HOW WE GOT TO
 THAT POINT.
 SOUTH BEND LOST ABOUT 30,000
 PEOPLE BETWEEN THE 1960s IN THE
 IT TIME I WAS RUNNING FOR MAYOR.
 ESPECIALLY WHEN I WAS KNOCKING
 ON DOORS IN MINORITY AND LOW
 INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS.
 I ALSO ASKED A LOT OF QUESTIONS
 ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON AND WHAT
 IS IT THE BIGGEST THING YOU WISH
 THE IT CITY WAS DOING FOR YOU?
 AND THE NUMBER ONE ANSWERER I
 HEARD CITY WIDE BUT AN ANSWER I
 HEARD IN PARTICULAR FROM PEOPLE
 LIVING IN MINORITY AND LOW
 EINCOME NEIGHBORHOODS WAS DO
 SOMETHING ABOUT THE VACANT,
 BOARDED UP AND COLLAPSING HOUSES
 AROUND ME BECAUSE IF YOU'RE A
 HOME OWNER AND THERE WERE SO
 MANY HOME OWNERS, ESPECIALLY IN
 AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN VICTIMIZED
 AND CRANICALLY LOW EINCOME, IT
 DESTROYED THE VALUE ALSO.
  IF YOU'RE NOT A HOME OWN, A
 RENTER, THEN YOU'RE LIVING IN A
 HOME WHERE AN ABANDONED HOME
 COULD BE USED FOR
 HEADQUARTERERS.
 AND SO I ASKED HOW MANY EHOUSES
 DO WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH AND
 NOBODY COULD TELL US.
 AND SO THAT'S WHEN WE STARTED
 ABOUT YEAR-LONG PROCESS OF
 TRYING TO MAP THE ISSUE.
 TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE
 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A HOUSE
 THAT'S AN ISOLATED CASE IN A
 RELATIVELY WELL-OFF
 NEIGHBORHOOD, WHICH MEANT IT WAS
 THE CASE THAT THE BEST APPROACH
 WAS PROBABLY JUST AGGRESSIVE
 CODE ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE CHANCES
 ARE THE OWNER HAD IT THE MEANS
 TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT OR MORE
 THAN 50% OF THE HOMES VACANT.
 ESPECIALLY BECAUSE ONE OF THE
 THINGS WE WERE FINDING WAS A LOT
 OF THE LAND OWNERS HAD WALKED
 AWAY THRUM HOUSES YEARS AGO OR
 CLEVERLY FIGURED OUT WAYS TO
 DISGUISE WHO OWNED THE HOUSE.
 WE'D LOOK UP WHO OWNED IT SO WE
 COULD HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE.
 THERE'S NO WAY TO HAVE
 ACCOUNTABILITY.
 AND I THOUGHT THESE
 NEIGHBORHOODS ARE NEVER GOING TO
 BE AS SAFE AS WE WANT THEM TO BE
 UNLESS WE DO SOMETHING AND ACT
 FAST.
 THAT'S WHY WE SET ASIDE FUNDING
 TO REINVEST IT IT IN THE FORM OF
 REPAIRS ON HOUSES, DEMOLISHING
 HOUSES WE COULDN'T AND
 ENFORCEMENT FOR IRRESPONSIBLE
 LANDLORDS THAT WERE ALLOWING
 THESE HOMES TO DETERIORATE.
 NO POLICY IS PERFECT AND WE
 LEARNED THINGS THE HARD WAY ON
 THIS ONE.
 OUR POLICY TOOLS DIDN'T DO A
 GREAT JOB AT FIRST OF BEING ABLE
 TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A
 BIG, BAD, OUT OF TOWN HOME OWNER
 AND SOMEBODY WHO MAYBE HAD THREE
 OR FOURER PROPERTIES OR SOMEBODY
 WOULD BUY A HOUSE AND NOT EVEN
 KNOW IT WAS ON THE VACANT AND
 ABANDONED LIST AND THAT WE WERE
 COMING TO DEMOLISH IT.
 OVER TIME WE LEARNED TO BE MORE
 IN DIALOGUE WITH HOME OWNERS OR
 A MORE ACCOMMODATING
 CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE HOME
 OWNERSHIP SIDE.
 WE LEARNED THE VALUE OF
 COMMUNICATION.
 QUANTITY/TIME.
 AND IT'S STILL AN EFFORT SOME
 PEOPLE HAD FRUSTRATIONS WITH.
 BUT THE NUMBER ONE CAN COMPLAINT
 WE HEARD, ESPECIALLY FROM
 MINORITY AND LOW INCOME HOME
 OWNERS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WAS
 WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?
 ANOTHER QUESTION FROM LONDON
 VALLEY.
 BUT FIRST I NEED TO GIVE YOU
 BACKGROUND.
 IN 2012 IT WAS DISCOVERED THE
 POLICE CHIEF OF SOUTH BEND HAD
 BEEN TAPING PHONE CONVERSATIONS
 OF SENIOR POLICE OFFICERS
 ALLEGEDLY USING RACIST LANGUAGE
 AND PARTICULARLY ABOUT HIM.
 YOU DEMOTED THE POLICE CHIEF.
 NO ACTION WAS TAKEN AGAINST THE
 OFFICERS.
 MAYOR, MY QUESTION IS
 STRAIGHT FORWARD.
 WHAT ARE ON THE SECRET TAPES
 REGARDING THE FLAT PIECE CHIEF?
 SO THE ANSWER IS I DON'T
 KNOW.
 AND THE REASON I DON'T KNOW IS
 THESE TAPE RECORDINGS WERE MADE
 IN A WAY THAT SPLA VIOLATED THE
 FEDERAL WIRE TAP ACT.
 IT CONTROLS WHEN YOU CAN AND
 CAN'T RECORD PEOPLE.
 AND THE ALLEGATION WAS THE IT
 POLICE CHIEF WAS USING THESE
 RECORDING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS
 GOING ON WITH INTERNAL RIVALRIES
 AND ALLEGEDLY BROKE THE FEDERAL
 WIRE TAP ACT WHEN HE DID THAT.
 THAT'S A LAW PUNISHABLE BY A
 TERM IN PRISON AND SO I'M NOT
 GOING TO VIOLATE IT, EVEN THOUGH
 I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON
 THE TAPES LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE
 DOES.
 AND THE JUDGE TO SAY WHETHER OR
 NOT THE CONTENT OF THE
 RECORDINGS TO BE RELEASED.
 THE REASON I DEMOTED THE CHIEF
 WAS THE SUBJECT OF A CRIMINAL
 INVESTIGATION AND IT MADE IT
 VERY PAINFUL TOO HE'S THE FIRST
 AFRICAN-AMERICAN CHIEF AND ONE
 OF THE REASONS I ASKED HIM TO
 SERVE IN THE FIRST PLACE WAS A
 GREAT TRACK RECORD IN COMMUNITY
 POLICING, WHICH IS A HUGE
 PRIORITY FOR US BECAUSE WE'RE A
 RACIALLY DIVERSE COMMUNITY AND
 SPEAKING OF THINGS YOU LEARN
 ALONG THE WAY.
 ONE OF THE THINGS I REALIZED IS
 WHILE I WAS ABSORBED IN MAKING
 SURE WE WEREN'T TRIPPING ON ANY
 LAND LINES RELATED TO LAWS OF
 WHAT YOU CAN AND CAN'T RECORD, I
 WAS FRANKLY A LITTLE SLOW TO
 UNDERSTAND JUST HOW MUCH ANGUISH
 UNDERTHEY ARE COMMUNITY'S
 RESPONSE.
 BECAUSE IT WASN'T JUST ABOUT
 WHETHER WE WERE RIGHT OR WRONG
 TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE
 FEDERAL WIRE TAP ACT, IT WAS
 ABOUT WHETHER COMMUNITIES OF
 COLOR COULD TRUST THAT
 COMMUNITIES HAD THEIR BEST
 INTERESTEST AT HEART.
 THE MORE I REALIZED LIFTING THE
 VEIL OF MISTRUST BETWEEN
 COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND OUR
 POLICE DEPARTMENT HAD TO BE ONE
 OF MY TOP PRIORITIES AS MAYOR.
 IT'S WHY WE IMPLEMENTED BODY
 WORN CAMERAS FOR ALL OF OUR
 OFFICERS AND GET TO KNOW PEOPLE
 IN THESE NEIGHBORHOODS,
 ESPECIALLY EXPERIENCING A LOT OF
 CRIME, NOT IN AN ENFORCEMENT
 ENVIRONMENT, BUT A TRUST BUILD
 NOTHING ENVIRONMENT.
 AND A NUMBER OF OTHER MEASURES
 INCLUDING MORE MINORITY RECRUITS
 IN THE DEPARTMENT ITSELF.
 SO THERE'S MORE OF THAT TRUST.
 RIGHT NOW THE IT POLICE FORCE
 WAS 5% AFRICAN-AMERICAN.
 AND THE TWO POLICE CHIEFS YOU
 HIRED SUBSEQUENTLY WERE BOTH
 WHITE.
 ONE OF THE THINGS WE DID ALSO
 AS A RESPONSE TO LEARNING HOW
 MUCH RESPONSE IN THE COMMUNITY
 WAS LEARNING A
 COMMUNITY-ORIENTED PROCESS.
 AND I BELIEVE WE WOULD NOT HAVE
 BEEN ABLE TO MAKE THOSE
 IMPROVEMENTS WITHOUT HAVING VERY
 QUALIFIED GOOD PEOPLE COME ON
 BOARD.
 BUT THESE ARE THE CHALLENGES,
 WHETHER IT'S THE RELATIONSHIP OF
 COMMUNITIES OF COLORER TO POLICE
 DEPARTMENTS OR HOMELESSNESS,
 HOUSING, POVERTY.
 AND FRANKLY, THEY'RE NOT
 PROBLEMS YOU SOLVE OVERNIGHT BUT
 I BELIEVE THEY ARER PROBLEMS
 THAT PEOPLE WITH GOOD WILL AND A
 LISTENING HEARTER ARE ABLE TO
 MAKE PROGRESS ON AND I IT DON'T
 THINK I WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
 BE REELECTED INCLUDING WINNING
 MINORITY DISTRICTS IN OUR CITY
 IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE VERY HARD
 WORK WE DID IN THE YEARS SINCE
 THAT INCIDENT REALLY THREATENED
 TO TEAR OUR CITY APART TO TRY TO
 HEAL.
 ES FOR AND I DON'T CLAIM WE GOT
 EVERY STEP PERFECT.
 BUT I WILL TELL YOU I DID
 EVERYTHING BASED ON THE BEST
 JUDGMENT AND DESIRE TO DO WHAT'S
 GOOD FOR OUR COMMUNITY.
 AND I BELIEVE WE NEED THAT KIND
 OF OF ATTENTION AND WILLINGNESS
 TO ADJUST.
 WE NEED A LOT MORE OF THAT IN
 WASHINGTON, ESPECIALLY IN THE
 WHITE HOUSE.
 ONE OF THE THINGS -YOU KNOW
 WE HAVE A LOT OF FOLKS FROM
 HARVARDEREDER.
 THEY HAVE A YOUTH POLL OUT.

  H
  HYMEN -HUMAN ROIGTSZ IS A TOP
 PRIORITY FOR VOTERS.
 ER.
 RIGHT.
 WELCOME BACK TO NEW HAMPSHIRE.
 MY QUESTION IS HOW WOULD YOU
 COOP WRAT COUNTRIES THAT VIEW
 HOM
 HOME SEXUALITY AS A CRIME TATS
 ARER PUNISHABLE BY DEATH?
 WELL, I THINK IT'S WRONG TO
 HARM OR PUNISH PEOPLE BECAUSE
 THEY'RE PART OF THE LGBTQ
 COMMUNITY.
 I SKBHOE AREN'T THERE.
 IN SOME RESPECTS OUR OWN COUNTRY
 ISN'T THERE.
 IT THIS IS WHY THE WORLD NEEDS
 AN AMERICA THAT'S STRONG AND
 CREDIBLE AND PEOPLE BELIEVE
 KEEPS ITS WORD.
 THE ABILITY OF OF THE NEXT
 PRESIDENT AND THE U.S. IN
 GENERAL TO LEAD ON THIS ISSUE
 AND GUIDE COUNTRIES TOWARDS THE
 RIGHT THING, DOES ANYBODY
 BELIEVE THEY HAVE MORAL
 AUTHORITY IN THE WORLD?
 IT'S PLUMMETED AND FRANKLY ANY
 KIND OF HUMAN RIGHTS OR
 DEMOCRACY PROMOTION WE WANT TO
 ADVANCE, EITHER BECAUSE WE THINK
 IT MAKES SENSE FROM AN AMERICAN
 PERSPECTIVE OR BECAUSE WE THINK
 IT'S CONSISTENT WITH AN
 ASPERATION FOR A BETTER LIFE.
 I STILL BELIEVE IN THE AMERICAN
 MODEL FOR ALL ITS FLAWS.
 WHEN I LOOK ON THE THE WORLD
 STAGE I THINK IT THE AMERICAN
 WAY OF DOING THINGS, OUR EFFORTS
 HOWEVER IMPERFECT ESTABLISH THE
 RIGHT WAY TO GO AND THERE'S A
 LOT OF OTHER MODELS BEING HELD
 UP AS CREDIBLE ALTERNATIVES.
 THE CHINESE MODEL.
 AUTHORITARIANISM IS BEING HELD
 UP AGAINST THE CHAOS AND
 DIVISION OF AMERICA RIGHT NOW.
 IT'S BEING HELD UP AS AN
 ALTERNATIVE.
 THE RUSSIAN MODEL IS THROWING
 ITS WEIGHT AROUND.
 DON'T GET ME START ODON THE
 SAUDI MODEL.
 THERE ARE OUGHT LOT OF OTHER
 WAYS COUNTRIES CAN OPERATE.
 AND BENEFIT AMONG OTHER THINGS
 VARIOUS MINORITIES BUT NOT IF
 WE'RE NOT CREDIBLE.
 AND WE'VE GOT TO DO BETTER ON
 THAT AND THE NEXT PRESIDENT
 PROBABLY WILL MAKE ALL THE
 DIFFERENCE IN THIS INCREDEBLE
 SENSITIVE TIME OF WORLD AFFAIRS.
 WHETHER WE GET INTO THE 20th
 CENTURY OR SOMETHING PEOPLE
 SCRATCH THEIR HEADS ABOUT.
 I WANT TO ASK YOU A PERSONAL
 QUESTION IF I CAN.
 WHEN YOU CAME OUT PUBLICLY 2013.
 HOW DO YOU THINK YOUR LIFE WOULD
 BE DIFFERENT IF YOU CAME OUT
 BEFORE THEN?
 I CAME OUT BECAUSE I WANTED
 TO DATE.
 AND IF DATING HAD BEEN AVAILABLE
 TO ME IN MY 20s, I'M NOT SURE I
 WOULD HAVE GOT NEARLY AS MUCH
 DONE.
 HONESTLY I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY.
 WHAT I DO KNOW IST FIRST I
 CONVINCED MYSELF I DIDN'T NEED
 MUCH ELSE I WAS ALSO A MEM BEOF
 THE RESERVE.
 AND THE CITY WAS A JEALOUS
 BRIDE.
 I WAS FINE WITH THAT UP TO A
 POINT.
 IT WAS WHEN I CAME BACK FROM MY
 DEPLOYMENT AND I CAME BACK FROM
 THAT LEAVE OF ABSENCE THAT I
 STAED THINKING ABOUT HOW YOU
 ONLY GET TO LIVE ONE LIFE.
 AND I CAME OUT AND I STARTED
 DATING AND I FOUND CHASTEN AND
 EVEN THOUGH IN THE PAST I WAS
 MYSTIFIED WITH THE IDEA OF HOW
 ANY OFF MY FELLOW MAYORS OR
 ELECTED OFFICIALS MANAGED TO DO
 THAT JOB AND BE IN RELATIONSHIPS
 AND BE MARRIED.
 I DON'T KNOW HOW I DO THIS
 WITHOUT HIM.
 I GUESS TO ANSWERER YOUR
 QUESTION I WOULD NOT BE RUNNING
 FOR PRESIDENT TODAY IF I HAD NOT
 COME OUT.
 I WANT TO BRING IN --
 ACTUALLY GOING TO TAKE A SHORTER
 BREAK.
 BRING BACK SOUTH BEND, INDIANA
 MAYOR.
  Shaving has been difficult for  me.
 I have very sensitive skin, and I get ingrowing hairs.
     So it's a daunting task.
    Oh I love it. It's a great    razor.
    It has that 'fence' in the    middle.
  It gives a nice smooth shave.
 Just stopping that irritation...
  That burn that I get is really  life changing.
        <i> The right gear...</i>
            <i> matters.</i>
     <i> Introducing the all-new</i>        <i> 2019 Ford Ranger,</i>
      <i> It's the right gear.</i>
    <i> With a Terrain Management</i>       <i> System for... this.</i>
    <i> A bash plate for... that.</i>
   <i> An Electronic Locking Rear</i>      <i> Differential for...</i>
          <i> Yeah... this.</i>

     When you come back the   next time, take care of CJ.
           <i> I promise.</i>
          <i> I was back and</i>
    <i> I would be there for CJ.</i>
       <i> I don't have all the</i>        <i> answers but I know</i>
         <i> we end up where</i>        <i> we're meant to be.</i>
               Carl, I appreciate               the invite here.
             As my broker,             what am I paying you             to manage my money?
      It's racquetball time.
         Ugh!
 Carl, does your firm offer a Satisfaction Guarantee?
                Like Schwab does.
            Guarantee?

 Carl, can you remind me
 what you've invested     my money in?
                It's complicated.
 <i> Are you asking enough questions</i>
    <i> about the way your wealth</i>        <i> is being managed?</i>
     <i> If not, talk to Schwab.</i>
   <i> A modern approach to Wealth</i>   <i> Management.</i>
 HEY, WELCOME BACK TO OUR SPECIAL DEMOCRATIC TOWN HALL
 EVENT.
 Y
  WE'RE IN THE HOMESTRETCH.
 VERY QUICKLY.
 IF YOU WERE IN THE HOUSE OR
 SENATE, WOULD YOU STREET IMPEACH
 PRESIDENT TRUMP?
 DO YOU THINK THE HOUSE SHOULD
 MOVE FOR IMPEACHMENT?
 I THINK HE'S MADE IT PRETTY
 CLEAR HE DESERVES IMPEACHMENT.
 IAL ARE LEAVE IT TO THE -I'M
 ALSO GOING TO LEAVE IT TO THE
 HOUSE AND SENATE TO FIGURE THAT
 OUT.
 MY JAB IS TO RELIGATE TRUMPISM
 TO THE DUST BIN OF HISTORY.
 AND HAVE AN ABSOLUTE THUMPING AT
 IT THE BALLOT BOX.
 FRERS
 DO YOU THINK IF DEMOCRATS
 FOCUS ON THIS IT'S GOING TO TAKE
 AWAY --
 CONGRESS IS GOING TO HAVE TO
 FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO SEVERAL
 THINGS AT ONCE BUT WHILE WE'RE
 FIGURING OUT OVERSIGHT, WHICH
 WE'VE GOT TO BEX WE HAVE TO
 FIGURE OUT THINGS THAT MOST
 EFFECT PEOPLE IN AN IMMEDIATE
 AND CONCRETE WAY.
 A LOT OFF VOTERS ARE DISEFFECTED
 ENTIRELY.
 AND IF WE'RE ONLY TALKING ABOUT
 HIM, AND FOLKS AT HOME FEEL LIKE
 NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT THEM.
 IT'S HARD TO LOOK AWAY FROM HEIR
 HORRORER SHOW.
 IT'S MESMERIZING.
 BUT WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT A
 WAY TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL.
 HE'S A STUDENT AT HARVARD LAW
 SCHOOL.
 YIKES.
 I'M A TOTAL SHRUB.
 HE SERVED AS A SURFER'S WARFARE
 OFFICER IN THE NAVY.
 HE'S GOT EVERYTHING.
 SHAWN HAS A QUESTION ABOUT YOUR
 TIME IN THE IT NAVY RESERVES.
 THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND
 FOR BEING HERE.
 MAYOR BUTTIGIEG.

 AS A NAVY VETERAN I WONDER
 HOW YOU RECONCILE YOUR CRITICISM
 OF PRESIDENT TRUMP WITH YOUR
 ALLEGIANCE TO OUR COMMANDER IN
 CHIEF.
 HAVE YOU EVER HAD TO TEMPER WHAT
 YOU SAY ABOUT THE PRESIDENT
 BECAUSE OF YOUR AFFILIATION WITH
 THE NAVY RESERVE.
 FIRST OF ALL, THANKS FOR YOUR
 SERVICE.
 I THOUGHT ABOUT THIS A LOT WHEN
 I WAS SERVING.
 DURING THE TIME I WAS IN THE
 RESERVE, I SEPARATED A COUPLE
 YEARS AGO, I ALWAYS TRIED IN
 PARTICULAR WHEN I WAS IN
 UNIFORM, AT DRILL, OR WHEN I WAS
 DEPLOYED TO KEEP MY POLITICS OUT
 OF IT BECAUSE I THINK ALL OF US
 ARRIVE WITH POLITICAL VIEWS.
 NOW, THAT SAID, THE VERY THING
 OR ONE OF THE THINGS I BELIEVE
 THAT I WAS SERVING TO DEFEND
 WITH MY LIFE WAS THE FACT THAT
 WE'RE A COUNTRY WHERE YOU GET TO
 BE CRITICAL OF YOUR POLITICAL
 LEADERS.
 I SWORE AN OATH TO THE
 CONSTITUTION, NOT TO THE
 PRESIDENT.
 AND THAT'S WHERE OUR ULTIMATE
 LOYALTY HAS TO LIE.
 BUT THE OTHER THING THAT
 HAPPENED WHILE I WAS SERVING
 ABROAD WAS THAT I LEARNED TO
 TRUST MY LIFE TO PEOPLE WHO HAD
 TOTALLY DIFFERENT POLITICAL
 VIEWS THAN I DID.
 THAT WAS THE AMAZING THING, AS
 YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU SERVE, IT WAS
 AN INSTITUTION THAT DREW PEOPLE
 FROM ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.
 IT WAS THE MOST RACIALLY
 INTEGRATED ORGANIZATION I'VE
 EVER BEEN A PART OF AND THERE
 WERE PEOPLE GETTING INTO MY
 VEHICLE WHO WE COULDN'T AGREE ON
 A SINGLE THING POLITICALLY.
 SOME PEOPLE THAT THE ONLY THING
 WE HAD IN COMMON WAS THE FACT OF
 BEING AMERICAN.
 AND YET KNOWING THAT WE HAD A
 JOB TO DO WE LEARNED TO TRUST
 EACH OTHER WITH OUR LIVES.
 NOW, I BELIEVE YOU SHOULDN'T
 HAVE TO GO TO WAR IN ORDER TO
 HAVE THAT KIND OF EXPERIENCE.
 WHICH IS WHY I BELIEVE AMERICA
 NEEDS TO CREATE MORE
 OPPORTUNITIES FOR NATIONAL
 SERVICE, IN PARTICULAR SERVICE
 YEAR OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE
 AFTER THEY FINISH HIGH SCHOOL SO
 THAT IN ADDITION TO THE MILITARY
 WE BUILD UP THINGS LIKE CITY
 EARTH, AMERCORPS, OTHER WAYS TO
 BE PART OF THAT FASHIONING A
 COMMON CHARACTER AT THIS MOMENT
 WHEN SOCIAL MEDIA AND OUR
 DIFFERENT BUBBLES HAVE US
 INCREASINGLY FLOATING IN OUR OWN
 LITTLE PARTS OF THIS COUNTRY
 WHEN FOR PRIOR GENERATIONS IT
 WAS MILITARY SERVICE THAT GAVE
 PEOPLE WITH RADICALLY DIFFERENT
 BACKGROUNDS ALMOST AS A MATTER
 OF COURSE WHEN IT WAS, FOR
 EXAMPLE, PRETTY MUCH ASSUMED IF
 YOU GRADUATED FROM AN IVY LEAGUE
 INSTITUTION THAT YOU WOULD GO
 INTO THE MILITARY.
 A GOOD NATIONAL SERVICE PROGRAM
 COULD HELP US DO JUST THAT.
 OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM
 CAMILLE, A FRESHMAN FROM
 HARVARD.
 MAYOR BUTTIGIEG, YOU'VE
 TALKED OPENLY ABOUT YOUR STRONG
 CHRISTIAN MAN AS WELL AS YOUR
 IDENTITY AS A GAY MARRIED MAN.
 HOW WILL YOU UNITE THIS BEHIND
 YOU AND YOUR PLATFORM?
 IT CAN BE CHALLENGING TO BE A
 PERSON OF THE FAITH WHO'S ALSO
 PART OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY AND
 YET TO ME THE CORE OF FAITH IS
 REGARD FOR ONE ANOTHER.
 AND PART OF HOW GOD'S LOVE IS
 EXPERIENCEDING TO MY
 FAITH TRADITION IS IN THE WAY
 THAT WE SUPPORT ONE ANOTHER AND
 IN PARTICULAR SUPPORT THE LEAST
 AMONG US.
 AGAIN, LET ME PREFACE THIS BY
 SAYING I BELIEVE STRONGLY IN THE
 SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE
 AND I THINK ANYBODY WHO STEPS
 INTO THE PUBLIC SPHERE NEEDS TO
 MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THEY'RE HERE
 TO SUPPORT PEOPLE OF ANY
 RELIGION AND PEOPLE OF NO
 RELIGION.
 BUT I ALSO THINK WE OUGHT TO BE
 HONEST ABOUT WHERE WE'RE COMING
 FROM.
 PART OF WHERE I'M COMING FROM IS
 A FAITH TRADITION THAT COUNSELS
 ME TO BE AS HUMBLE AS POSSIBLE,
 THAT COUNSELS ME TO LOOK AFTER
 THOSE WHO NEED DEFENDING.
 AND FRANKLY IT COULDN'T BE MORE
 RADICALLY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I
 SEE CERTAINLY IN THIS WHITE
 HOUSE WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF
 CHEST THUMPING AND
 SELF-AGGRANDIZING, NOT TO
 MENTION ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR.
 BUT ALSO A POLITICAL AGENDA THAT
 SEEMS TO ALWAYS BE REVOLVING
 AROUND THE IDEA THAT SOMEHOW
 IT'S TOO EASY FOR POOR PEOPLE IN
 THIS COUNTRY R IT'S JUST SO
 DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I GET WHEN I
 READ SCRIPTURE.
 AND I GET THAT ONE OF THE THINGS
 ABOUT SCRIPTURE IS DIFFERENT
 PEOPLE SEE DIFFERENT THINGS IN
 IT.
 BUT AT THE VERY LEAST WE SHOULD
 BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH THAT GOD
 DOES NOT HAVE A POLITICAL PARTY.
 JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT,
 YOU'VE GOTTEN INTO A PUBLIC BACK
 AND FORTH BETWEEN VICE PRESIDENT
 PENCE AND YOURSELF OVER THE
 ISSUE OF DISCRIMMATION AGAINST
 LGBTQ PEOPLE AND FAITH, THE
 CURRENT AMBASSADOR SO GERMANY
 WEIGHED IN ON THIS SAYING YOU
 HAVE BEEN QUOTE PUSHING THIS
 HATE HOAX ALONG THE LINES OF
 JUSSIE SMOLLETT FOR A VERY LONG
 TIME NOW, SEVERAL WEEKS.
 HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT?
 I'M NOT A MASTER FISHERMAN,
 BUT I KNOW BAIT WHEN I SEE IT
 AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE IT.
 ALL RIGHT.
 OUR NEXT QUESTION -OUR NEXT
 QUESTION COMES FROM -OUR NEXT
 QUESTION COMES FROM A GRADUATE
 STUDENT AT THE HARVARD KENNEDY
 SCHOOL FROM OREGON.
 GOOD EVENING, MY QUESTION IS,
 MANY PEOPLE ACCUSE OUR
 GENERATION, I'M 31, AND YOUNGER
 GENERATIONS OF BEING FAKE WOKE,
 OR OF THE AGE OF INSTAGRAM.
 AS THE YOUNGEST CANDIDATE WHAT
 DO YOU THINK SETS YOU APART FROM
 THE OTHER CANDIDATES AND WHAT DO
 YOU THINK HAS BEEN UNFAIR
 CRITICISM?
 WELL, I THINK, YOU KNOW, IN
 THE SAME WAY A CANDIDATE NEEDS
 TO BE THERE FOR PEOPLE OF EVERY
 RELIGION OR NO RELIGION YOU'VE
 GOT TO BE THERE FOR PEOPLE OF
 EVERY GENERATION.
 THE LONGER YOU'RE PLANNING TO BE
 HERE, BY DEFINITION, THE MORE
 YOU HAVE AT STAKE IN THE
 DECISIONS THAT ARE GOING TO BE
 MADE, ESPECIALLY WHEN CLIMATE
 CHANGE IS LARGELY GOING TO
 DICTATE THE ECONOMIC
 OPPORTUNITIES AND EVEN PHYSICAL
 SAFETY OF PEOPLE OUR AGE AND
 YOUNGER IN PARTICULAR.
 AT A TIME WHEN WE'RE GOING TO BE
 ASKED TO FOOT THE BILL FOR
 UNAFFORDABLE TAX CUTS ON
 BILLIONAIRES PASSED BY THE LAST
 CONGRESS AND SIGNED BY THIS
 ADMINISTRATION.
 WHILE I THINK ANYBODY OF ANY AGE
 CAN SPEAK TO THESE ISSUES I
 THINK HAVING A PERSONAL STAKE IN
 WHAT THE WORLD'S GOING TO LOOK
 LIKE IN 2054, THAT'S THE YEAR I
 GET TO THE CURRENT AGE OF THE
 CURRENT PRESIDENT, I THINK
 HAVING A PERSONAL STAKE IN THAT
 HELPS YOU HAVE STANDING TO SPEAK
 TO SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND
 CONCERNS.
 I DO THINK THAT SOMETIMES PEOPLE
 LOOK AT OUR GENERATION AND RAISE
 AN EYEBROW.
 PART OF IT IS OUT OF A SENSE
 THAT WE'RE NOT AS POLITICALLY
 ENGAGED.
 WHEN I WAS A STUDENT, AROUND THE
 TIME THE IOP STARTED DOING AN
 ANNUAL POLL, A BODY OF RESEARCH
 AROUND YOUNG PEOPLE'S
 INVOLVEMENT IN POLITICS AND THE
 HYPOTHESIS THEY WERE TESTING AT
 THE TIME WAS THE YOUNG PEOPLE
 DON'T CARE AS MUCH, PATTERNS OF
 VOTING AND VOLUNTEERISM WERE
 LOW.
 WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT WHILE
 VOTING AND VOLUNTEERISM ON
 CAMPAIGNS WAS LOW, VOLUNTEERING
 IN COMMUNITIES WAS HIGH.
 THE QUESTION WASN'T WHAT'S WRONG
 WITH YOUNG PEOPLE, THE QUESTION
 WAS, WHAT'S WRONG WITH OUR
 SYSTEM, THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO
 CLEARLY DO CARE ABOUT THE WORLD
 AROUND THEM DON'T NECESSARILY
 BELIEVE THAT POLITICS HAS
 ANYTHING TO OFFER THEM.
 THAT'S SOMETHING WE'VE GOT TO I
 THINK WHICH A.
 WHILE I PASSIONATELY BELIEVE
 THAT EVERY YOUNG PERSON OUGHT TO
 BE INVOLVED, OUGHT TO VOTE,
 OUGHT TO BE ENGAGED, OUGHT TO
 HOLD CANDIDATES ACCOUNTABLE, I
 ALSO RECOGNIZE WHY A LOT OF
 YOUNG PEOPLE QUESTION WHETHER
 THEIR VOTES MATTER, I BELIEVE
 THAT THAT'S ONE REASON WHY WE
 NEED VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD
 REFORMS LIKE AN ELECTORAL
 COLLEGE REFORM THAT WOULD SWITCH
 IT TO JUST ELECTING OUR
 PRESIDENT BASED ON THE PERSON
 WHO GETS THE MOST VOTES TO ■W■W
 SOMETHING ABOUT MONEY AND
 POLITICS AND REDISTRICTING AND
 ALL THESE THINGS WE'VE TALKED
 ABOUT FOR YEARS, THEY'VE ALWAYS
 BEEN IMPORTANT BUT NEVER SEEN AS
 URGENT.
 I THINK THAT CRITIQUE OF YOUNG
 PEOPLE OF THINKING TWICE BEFORE
 WE GET INVOLVED IN POLITICS, IN
 THE SHORT TERM, I HOPE TO DEFEAT
 THAT BY GETTING MORE YOUNG
 PEOPLE INVOLVED IN POLITICS.
 BUT IN THE LONG TERM I HOPE TO
 MAKE OUR POLITICS MORE INCLUSIVE
 SO THE YOUNG PEOPLE NEVER HAVE
 TO ASK THAT QUESTION, DOES MY
 VOICE MATTER?
 MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG, THANK
 YOU.
 THANK YOU TO OUR AUDIENCE
 TONIGHT WHO HAVE BEEN WITH US
 FOR THE LAST FIVE HOURS.
 INCREDIBLE NIGHT.
 WE'VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING LIKE
 THAT.
 THANK YOU ALL.
 WE WANT TO THANK THE INSTITUTE
 OF POLITICS.
 UP NEXT, MY COLLEAGUE IS PICKING
 UP OUR COVERAGE OF THE SPECIAL
 TO HALL EVENT LIVE FROM NEW
 YORK, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
