[ APPLAUSE ] I CAN DO MORE TO LOWER MY A1C. BECAUSE MY BODY CAN STILL MAKE ITS OWN INSULIN. AND I TAKE TRULICITY ONCE A WEEK TO ACTIVATE MY BODY TO RELEASE IT, LIKE IT'S SUPPOSED TO. TRULICITY IS NOT INSULIN. IT STARTS ACTING IN MY BODY FROM THE FIRST DOSE AND CONTINUES TO WORK WHEN I NEED IT, 24/7. TRULICITY IS AN INJECTION TO IMPROVE BLOOD SUGAR IN ADULTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES WHEN USED WITH DIET AND EXERCISE. DON'T USE IT AS THE FIRST MEDICINE TO TREAT DIABETES, OR IF YOU HAVE TYPE 1 DIABETES OR DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS. DON'T TAKE TRULICITY IF YOU OR YOUR FAMILY HAVE MEDULLARY THYROID CANCER, YOU'RE ALLERGIC TO TRULICITY, OR HAVE MULTIPLE ENDOCRINE NEOPLASIA SYNDROME TYPE 2. STOP TRULICITY AND CALL YOUR DOCTOR RIGHT AWAY IF YOU HAVE SYMPTOMS OF A SERIOUS ALLERGIC REACTION, A LUMP OR SWELLING IN YOUR NECK, OR SEVERE STOMACH PAIN. SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS MAY INCLUDE PANCREATITIS. TAKING TRULICITY WITH A SULFONYLUREA OR INSULIN INCREASES YOUR LOW BLOOD SUGAR RISK. COMMON SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE NAUSEA, DIARRHEA, VOMITING, ABDOMINAL PAIN, AND DECREASED APPETITE. THESE CAN LEAD TO DEHYDRATION, WHICH MAY WORSEN KIDNEY PROBLEMS. I CHOOSE ONCE-WEEKLY TRULICITY TO ACTIVATE MY WITHIN. IF YOU NEED HELP LOWERING YOUR A1C, ASK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT ONCE-WEEKLY TRULICITY. 60% of women wear the wrong size pad and can experience leaks.
