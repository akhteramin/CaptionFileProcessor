 ALL RIGHT. THAT WRAPS UP THIS HOUR OF MSNBC
 LIVE.
 MY FRIEND ALI VELSHI HERE TO
 PICK UP OUR COVERAGE.
 NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
 FUN WORKING WITH YOU YESTERDAY,
 COVERING A DIFFICULT STORY BUT
 THANK YOU FOR YOUR COVERAGE.
 ARE YOU DONE?
 I AM DONE.
 HAVE A GREAT REST OF THE DAY.
 YOU TOO.
 I'M ALI VELSHI, 2:00 IN THE
 EAST WHERE A DEADLINE HAS JUST
 PASSED WHERE THE WHITE HOUSE
 WILL KEEP FIGHTING.
 A FEDERAL JUDGE IN MARYLAND
 OVERSEEING THREE SEPARATE
 LAWSUITS OVER THE QUESTION RULES
 THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MUST
 EXPLAIN HOW IT'S GOING TO
 PROCEED BY 2:00 P.M.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP ADDRESSED THE
 CONTROVERSY WITH REPORTERS
 EARLIER.
 ARE YOU GOING TO ISSUE AN
 EXECUTIVE ORDER ON THE CENSUS?
 IT'S ONE OF THE WAYS WE'RE
 THINKING ABOUT DOING IT
 SERIOUSLY, WE'RE DOING WELL ON
 THE CENSUS.
 [ INAUDIBLE ].
 NO.
 HE MADE A STATEMENT AND WROTE
 SOMETHING OUT.
 THE JUDGE DIDN'T LIKE IT.
 I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR
 JUSTICE ROBERTS BUT HE DIDN'T
 LIKE IT, BUT HE DID SAY COME
 BACK.
 ESSENTIALLY HE SAID, COME BACK.
 THAT'S WHAT HE WAS SAYING.
 WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
 THE CASE SEEMED ALL BUT
 SETTLED A FEW DAYS AGO.
 THE SUPREME COURT RULED LAST
 WEEK THAT COMMERCE DEPARTMENT'S
 CURRENT JUSTIFICATION FOR
 PUTTING THE QUESTION ON THE
 CENSUS WAS NOT LEGALLY SOUND
 CALLING IT CONTRIVED.
 THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEGUN
 PRINTING COPIES WITHOUT THE
 QUESTION INCLUDED.
 THE PRESIDENT REPORTEDLY SPURRED
 ON BY ALLIES ANNOUNCED ON
 TWITTER HIS ADMINISTRATION WOULD
 ONCE AGAIN TAKE UP THE FIGHT
 SENDING WHITE HOUSE LAWYERS
 SCRAMBLING TO COME UP WITH A NEW
 ARGUMENT.
 JOINING ME JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT
 PETE WILLIAMS.
 PETE, YOU HAVE HAD A LOT OF
 SPECIFIC GUIDANCE THAT YOU'VE
 BEEN GIVING US THROUGH THE
 DAY --
 PARDON, I'M GOING TO LOOK
 AWAY, THIS IS GOING TO PANIC
 EVERYONE TO SPEAKING TO ME IN MY
 EAR, I'M LISTENING BUT LOOKING
 AT SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN
 FILED.
 THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WAITING
 FOR.
 2:00 P.M. DEADLINE FOR A FILING
 IN WHICH THE GOVERNMENT EITHER
 HAD TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO
 CONTINUE ON WITH THIS FIGHT OR
 IT COULD SAY WE'RE NOT
 CONTINUING.
 THE 2:00 P.M., THE MOST
 IMPORTANT THING THAT WOULD
 HAPPEN IF THE GOVERNMENT WOULD
 SAY WE'RE GIVING IT UP.
 THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE'RE
 WAITING FOR.
 IF THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T CHOOSE
 TO WITHDRAW ITS FIGHT THEN
 THINGS CONTINUE AS THEY ARE.
 THE CENSUS WILL BE PRINTED, THE
 GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE TO FIGURE
 OUT A NEW WAY TO GET IT ON THERE
 AND THAT MAY NOT HAPPEN.
 THIS IS WHAT'S JUST A SECOND
 AGO BEEN FILED BY THE GOVERNMENT
 AND NO SURPRISE HERE, THEY SAY
 WE'RE GOING TO KEEP FIGHTING.
 THEY FILE WHAT THEY CALL THEIR
 PROPOSED DISCOVERY PLAN AND WHAT
 THEY SAY IS, THEY LAY OUT A
 SCHEDULE FOR HOW TO CONTINUE IN
 THIS MARYLAND LAWSUIT, A
 SEPARATE LAWSUIT FROM THE
 SUPREME COURTS CASE, ON THE
 CENSUS FORM.
 SO NO SURPRISE HERE, THE
 GOVERNMENT SAYS IT WANTS TO
 CONTINUE FIGHTING.
 WHILE YOU READ THAT, THE
 GOVERNMENT SAYS IT'S GOING TO
 CONTINUE FIGHTING FOR THE MOMENT
 THE GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO
 PRINT THE CENSUS FORMS BECAUSE
 THAT WAS THE ARGUMENT THEY USED
 THEY NEEDED A JUDGMENT OR AT
 LEAST SOME KIND OF GUIDANCE FROM
 THE SUPREME COURT BEFORE JUNE
 30th IN ORDER TO PRINT THESE
 FORMS.
 SO THOSE FORMS CONTINUE TO BE
 PRINTED.
 THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT GIVING UP
 ITS FIGHT.
 LOGISTICALLY, PETE, WHAT HAPPENS
 NEXT?
 CAN THE -WHAT CAN HAPPEN?
 ALL RIGHT.
 SO HERE ARE THE OPTIONS BASED ON
 WHAT I HAVE JUST BEEN ABLE TO
 READ FROM WHAT THE GOVERNMENT
 HAS FILED AND THE OTHER SIDE IN
 THE CASE HAS FILED.
 SO FIRST WE HAVE THE SUPREME
 COURT CASE.
 THAT WAS STARTED FROM A LAWSUIT
 FILED BY 18 STATES LED BY NEW
 YORK, WENT TO THE U.S. SUPREME
 COURT, LAST WEEK THE SUPREME
 COURT SAID THIS EXPLANATION THAT
 COMMERCE SECRETARY WILBUR ROSS
 GAVE FOR WHY HE WANTED THE
 QUESTION ON THE FORM CLEARLY
 DOESN'T WASH.
 YOU CAN'T PRINT THE CENSUS IF
 THAT'S THE BASIS FOR WANTING IT
 ON THE FORM.
 THE SUPREME COURT HAS ORDERED
 THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO PRINT THE
 CENSUS WITH THAT QUESTION ON IT
 AND, IN FACT, IT'S NOW PRINTING
 IT WITHOUT THAT QUESTION.
 SO WHAT ARE THE ALTERNATIVES.
 ONE WILBUR ROSS COULD COME UP
 WITH A NEW JUSTIFICATION FOR IT
 THAT WOULD START A WHOLE NEW
 ROUND OF LITIGATION.
 THE GOVERNMENT CLEARLY THINKS
 THAT'S NOT A PRODUCTIVE WAY
 BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT EARLIER
 THIS WEEK IT WAS OVER AND THE
 PRESIDENT SAID YOU HAVE TO KEEP
 TRYING.
 ANOTHER POSSIBILITY THAT THE
 PRESIDENT HIMSELF RAISED TODAY
 IS, THE PRESIDENT SIMPLY SIGNS
 AN EXECUTIVE ORDER DIRECTING THE
 COMMERCE DEPARTMENT TO TELL THE
 CENSUS BUREAU TO PUT THE
 QUESTION ON THE FORM THAT WOULD
 START A NEW ROUND OF LITIGATION.
 ALL THESE -ANYTHING THE
 GOVERNMENT DOES FROM HERE ON
 IS --
 LET'S STOP FOR A SECOND.
 EXECUTIVE ORDERS.
 THIS PRESIDENT BELIEVES IN.
 HE'S NOT THE FIRST PRESIDENT TO
 THINK SO, THAT CERTAIN THINGS
 CAN BE DONE BY EXECUTIVE ORDER
 BUT IS THE PRESIDENT CLEAR AN
 EXECUTIVE ORDER TO PUT THE
 QUESTION ON THE CENSUS DOESN'T
 MEAN THE CENSUS GETS PRINTED
 WITH THE CITIZENSHIP QUESTION ON
 IT?
 CORRECT.
 IT'S NOT GOING TO DO IT BY
 ITSELF BECAUSE THAT WILL
 IMMEDIATELY PRODUCE ANOTHER
 COURT CHALLENGE.
 ANYTHING THE GOVERNMENT DOES
 FROM HERE ON IS GOING TO PRODUCE
 A COURT CHALLENGE.
 THAT'S A CERTAINTY.
 SO BACK TO YOUR QUESTION USING
 THE WORD LOGISTICS, HOW LONG
 WOULD THAT TAKE?
 HOW LONG DOES THE GOVERNMENT
 HAVE BEFORE IT REALLY CAN'T --
 IT HAS TO KEEP PRINTING THE
 FORMS WITHOUT THE QUESTION.
 I DON'T THINK ANYBODY HAS A
 GOOD, CLEAR ANSWER TO WHEN THE
 FINAL DROP DEAD DATE IS FOR NOT
 TINKERING AROUND WITH THIS THING
 ANY FURTHER.
 IT'S GOINGS TO COST A LOT OF
 MONEY IF THEY THROW AWAY ALL THE
 FORMS THEY'VE ALREADY PRINTED
 AND START OVER AGAIN.
 ANOTHER OPTION, THOUGH, WOULD BE
 TO EITHER INCLUDE THIS
 CITIZENSHIP QUESTION ON THE
 LONGER FORM, THE HOUSEHOLD
 SURVEY THAT GOES TO A SMALL
 PERSONAL OF U.S. HOUSEHOLDS, OR
 AN ADDITIONAL FORM, AN
 ADDITIONAL QUESTION THAT GOES
 WITH THE SHORT FORM THAT GOES TO
 ALL HOUSEHOLDS, JUST A SIMPLE
 PIECE OF PAPER THAT SAYS ARE YOU
 A U.S. CITIZEN, YES OR NO, WHAT
 THEY WANTED TO PUT ON THE FORM
 IN THE FIRST PLACE.
 THAT, TOO, WOULD LEAD TO
 LITIGATION BECAUSE THE GROUPS
 OPPOSED SAY WHITE HAVE IS THE
 SAME KIND OF CHILLING EFFECT.
 BUT, YOU KNOW, AS WE THINK
 THROUGH ALL THIS, REMEMBER, NO
 MATTER WHAT YOU MAY THINK OF
 THIS AS A POLICY MATTER, OF
 WHETHER IT'S A WISE THING TO PUT
 THIS ON THE FORM, WHETHER IT
 WILL LEAD TO AN UNDER COUNT OR
 GIVE US MORE INFORMATION, THAT'S
 A BALANCING TEST.
 JUST RECALL THAT THROUGHOUT MOST
 CENSUSES IN AMERICAN HISTORY
 THERE HAS BEEN A CITIZENSHIP
 QUESTION.
 THE GOVERNMENT HAS SOME WEIGHT
 ON ITS SIDE IF IT CAN COME UP
 WITH A RATIONALE THAT SATISFIES
 THESE CHALLENGES.
 ONE OTHER POINT, THE PRESIDENT
 SAID TODAY WHEN ASKED WHY DO YOU
 WANT THIS QUESTION ON THE FORM,
 YOU NEED IT TO FIGURE OUT HOW
 MANY SEATS A STATE GETS IN THE
 HOUSE.
 THAT IS DEMONSTRABLY NOT TRUE.
 NO APPORTIONMENT THROUGHOUT OUR
 HISTORY, WE CELEBRATED ANOTHER
 BIRTHDAY, HAS EVER BEEN BASED ON
 JUST COUNTING CITIZENS.
 IT'S ALWAYS BEEN TOTAL
 INHABITANTS.
 THAT WAS CLEAR FROM THE
 CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION AND
 WHEN CONGRESS ENACTED THE 14th
 AMENDMENT WHICH GAVE FURTHER
 GUIDANCE ON HOW TO CONDUCT A
 CENSUS.
 YOU DON'T NEED CITIZENSHIP TO
 APPORTION THE HOUSE.
 YOU CAN HANG OUT WITH ME
 WHILE I BRING BARBARA McQUADE
 IN, YOU HAVE READING TO DO, SO
 YOU'RE WELCOME TO SIT IN FRONT
 OF THE CAMERA AND IF YOU HEAR
 SOMETHING YOU WANT CHIME IN.
 BRING IN FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY
 BARBARA McQUADE IN.
 THERE'S A LOT TO GET THROUGH
 HERE.
 THIS SEEMED LIKE A SIMPLE
 QUESTION AT ONE TIME, CAN YOU
 PUT THE CITIZENSHIP QUESTION ON
 THE CENSUS OR NOT.
 NOW IT'S GOTTEN COMPLICATED
 BECAUSE THE SUPREME COURT SAID
 THAT THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT'S
 REASONING WAS NOT APPROPRIATE
 FOR DOING SO, BUT THEY DIDN'T
 SAY THAT MEANS TO PETE'S EARLIER
 POINT THAT A CITIZENSHIP
 QUESTION CAN'T BE ON THE CENSUS.
 BASICALLY THE SUPREME COURT SAID
 TO THE GOVERNMENT, YOU CAN COME
 BACK WITH A BETTER REASON AND
 TRY AGAIN.
 WELL, THEY CAN, BUT IT HAS TO
 BE A GENUINE REASON.
 WHAT THE COURT FOUND WAS, THAT
 THE REASON THAT THEY GAVE THAT
 THE PURPOSE WAS SO THAT THEY
 COULD BETTER COMPLY WITH THE
 VOTING RIGHTS ACT, WAS A LIE, A
 PRETEXT.
 THE WORD THEY USED WAS
 CONTRIVANCE.
 IF YOU WANT TO TRY AGAIN AND
 TELL US THE REAL REASON WE'LL
 CONSIDER THAT.
 IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THEY COULD
 SAY YOU KNOW, WHEN WE TOLD YOU
 IT WAS ABOUT THE VOTING RIGHTS
 ACT WE MADE A MISTAKE.
 THE REAL REASON WAS THE
 FOLLOWING.
 IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THAT ANY
 NEW REASON THEY CAME UP WITH, MY
 DOG ATE IT, IS SOMETHING THAT
 COULD BE BELIEVED.
 IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE GOING
 FORWARD THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE
 A PATH TO VICTORY HERE FOR
 PRESIDENT TRUMP.
 NOW THERE'S ANOTHER ISSUE AND
 THAT IS THAT THESE -THE
 GOVERNMENT'S LAWYERS WENT TO THE
 SUPREME COURT AND SAID, WE KIND
 OF NEED THIS DONE IN A HURRY
 BECAUSE WE HAVE TO PRINT THESE
 FORMS BY JUNE 30th IN ORDER TO
 GET THEM PRINTED AND DISTRIBUTED
 ON TIME.
 NOW, WHEN YOU GO BACK TO THE
 SUPREME COURT AND YOU SAY YEAH,
 THAT DEADLINE WE TOLD YOU WE
 NEEDED IT DONE BY, BECAUSE WE
 HAVE DIFFERENT REASONS WE CAN
 PUSH THAT DEADLINE, DOES THAT
 AFFECT THE CREDIBILITY OF THE
 GOVERNMENT'S LAWYERS IN FRONT OF
 THE SUPREME COURT OR IS THAT NOT
 IMPORTANT?
 NO, IT ABSOLUTELY DOES.

 ERRY LAWYER WHO WORKS FOR THE
 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE NOT ONLY
 LIKE EVERY LAWYER DO THEY HAVE A
 DUTY OF CANDOR TO THE TRIBUNAL
 BUT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS A
 HIGHER DUTY AS LAWYERS ON BEHALF
 OF THE UNITED STATES TO TELL THE
 TRUTH.
 IN FACT, HERE IT WASN'T JUST A
 PASSING STATEMENT THAT THEY MADE
 THAT COULD BE CHARACTERIZED AS A
 SLIP OF THE TONGUE, THEY
 AFFIRMATIVELY SAID WE DON'T HAVE
 TIME TO GO TO THE NORMAL ROUTE
 OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT COURT OF
 APPEALS BECAUSE TIME IS OF THE
 ESSENCE AND THIS IS OF SUCH
 PUBLIC IMPORTANCE WE NEED TO
 SKIP THAT STEP AND GO TO THE
 SUPREME COURT BECAUSE JUNE 30th
 IS OUR DEADLINE FOR GETTING THIS
 PRINTED.
 TO GO BACK AND SAY WE MADE THAT
 UP WOULD HARM THE JUSTICE
 DEPARTMENT AND EVERY OTHER CASE
 IT LITIGATES EVERY DAY AROUND
 THE COUNTRY.
 PETE?
 JUST -THIS IS A SHORT THING
 THAT THE GOVERNMENT FILED HERE,
 AND I DON'T THINK IT REALLY
 CHANGES A LOT OF WHAT WE'VE
 SAID.
 TO AMPLIFY ONE THING, THEY SAY,
 JUDGE WE'RE CURRENT ENJOINED IN
 PRINTING A CENSUS QUESTIONNAIRE
 THAT INCLUDES THE CITIZENSHIP
 QUESTION.
 WE'RE NOT DOING IT.
 BUT ANY NEW DECISION BY THE
 COMMERCE DEPARTMENT ON PROVIDING
 ANOTHER RATIONALE FOR WHY IT
 WANTS TO DO THIS WOULD
 CONSTITUTE A NEW FINAL ACTION
 AND PLAINTIFFS WILL BE ENTITLED
 TO CHALLENGE THE DECISION.
 THAT GOES BACK TO WHAT WE WERE
 SAYING EARLIER, IF THE COMMERCE
 SECRETARY SAYS HERE'S WHY I WANT
 TO DO IT THAT WOULD LEAD TO
 ANOTHER ROUND OF LITIGATION.
 ALL THEY SAY IS IN THE EVENT THE
 COMMERCE DEPARTMENT ADOPTS A NEW
 RATIONALE, THE GOVERNMENT WILL
 IMMEDIATELY NOTIFY THIS COURT,
 THE JUDGE IN MARYLAND, SO IT CAN
 DETERMINE WHETHER THERE'S ANY
 NEED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS OR
 RELIEF.
 THAT'S THE SEPARATE MARYLAND
 CASE THAT DID NOT GO TO THE
 SUPREME COURT THAT IS STILL
 SIMMERING.
 THANK YOU FOR YOUR GREAT
 REPORTING ON THIS, PETE
 WILLIAMS, AND BARBARA McQUAID,
 THANK YOU AS ALWAYS.
 BARBARA McQUADE IS A FORMER USE
 ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR THE EASTERN
 DISTRICT OF MICHIGAN.
 PETE WILLIAMS OUR JUSTICE
 REPORTER WILL CONTINUE TO REPORT
 ON THIS.
 THE FIRST FRIDAY OF THE
 MONTH IT MUST BE JOBS DAY AND
 JUNE'S NUMBERS APPEAR TO BE A
 CORRECTION FROM MAY'S DISMAL
 SHOWING.
 224,000 NET NEW JOBS WERE ADDED
 LAST MONTH.
 THAT'S A GOOD NUMBER.
 DON'T LET ANYBODY TELL YOU
 OTHERWISE.
 UNEMPLOYMENT TICKED UP SLIGHTLY
 FROM 3.6 TO 3.7%.
 HOURLY EARNINGS UP 3.1% YEAR
 OVER YEAR.
 THAT LOOKS PRETTY GOOD.
 REMEMBER, THAT YOU ALWAYS HAVE
 TO SUBTRACT INFLATION FROM THAT.
 ALL EYES ARE NOW ON THE FEDERAL
 RESERVE WHERE CHAIRMAN JEROME
 POWELL IS GOING TO HAVE TO
 DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THESE
 NUMBERS WARRANT SLASHING
 INTEREST RATES.
 JOINING ME CNBC'S JOHN HARWOOD.
 THIS IS A TOUGH ONE FOR THE
 PRESIDENT TO SPIN BECAUSE ON ONE
 HAND HE LIKES THE JOBS NUMBERS
 ALMOST AS HE LIKES THE STOCK
 MARKET NUMBERS.
 THE TOUTING STRONG NUMBERS MEANS
 THAT THE FED NOW HAS TO
 RECONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT TO CUT
 TRSZ, WHICH THE PRESIDENT REALLY
 WANTS THE FED TO DO.
 THAT'S RIGHT, ALI.
 IT WON'T CONSTRAIN THE
 PRESIDENT.
 HE'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO WANT
 THAT INTEREST RATE CUT BECAUSE
 THE ECONOMY -GROWTH IN THE
 ECONOMY IS SLOWING FROM 2018 AND
 HE WANTS IT TO REV UP AGAIN
 GOING INTO THE 2020 ELECTION
 YEAR.
 BUT THE FED, WHICH WEIGHS DATA,
 HAS GOT TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER OR
 NOT THIS INDICATES THAT IT WOULD
 BE TOO EARLY TO MAKE A RATE CUT
 IN LIGHT OF THESE JOBS NUMBERS.
 WE DID HAVE A DOWNWARD REVISION
 ON APRIL AND JUNE, SO -OR
 EXCUSE ME, APRIL AND MAY, SO
 THAT IS ONE NEGATIVE IN THAT
 PICTURE, BUT NEVERTHELESS, THESE
 ARE GOOD NUMBERS AND YOU KNOW,
 JAY POWELL IN HIS LAST PRESS
 CONFERENCE SAID THEY REMOVED THE
 WORD PATIENCE FROM THEIR
 GUIDANCE AND INDICATED THEY
 WOULD BE INCLINED IF THE DATA
 SUGGESTED TO CUT RATES ONE OR
 MORE TIMES IN THE REST OF THE
 YEAR.
 THIS MAKES THAT DECISION MORE
 DIFFICULT.
 THE ONE THING THAT PRESIDENT
 WANTS IS HE WANTS TO GOOSE THOSE
 GROWTH NUMBERS.
 THEY ARE A LITTLE SLOWER.
 WE DO NOT APPEAR TO BE IN
 RECESSION TERRITORY OR CLOSE TO
 IT AT THIS POINT.
 THEY ARE SMALLER THAN THEY WERE
 AND THEY'RE SMALLER THAN THE
 PRESIDENT HAD PROMISED WHEN HE
 RAN IN HIS ELECTION.
 IF YOU RECALL HE SAID MY
 ECONOMISTS THINK IT WILL BE 3%,
 I THINK IT COULD BE 4, 5, 6%.
 THAT IS THE ONE LEVER THAT THE
 GOVERNMENT HAS IN THEORY.
 IF YOU INTEREST RATES IT'S LIKE
 HITTING THE GAS PEDAL ON THE
 ECONOMY, RIGHT.
 THAT'S THE THING THAT CAN CAUSE
 GROWTH TO INCREASE BECAUSE IT
 BECOMES CHEAPER TO BORROW MONEY,
 MONEY IS MORE AVAILABLE, PEOPLE
 INVEST, THEY BUILD PLANTS, THEY
 BUY HOUSES, THINGS LIKE THAT.
 THAT'S RIGHT.
 IT'S ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT FOR
 HIM TO HIT THE GAS PEDAL SINCE
 HIS OTHER FOOT IS HITTING THE
 BRAKE WITH THE TRADE WAR.
 THE UNCERTAINTY AND FRICTION
 WITH CHINA, THE DISRUPTION OF
 SUPPLY CHAINS, THE HIGHER
 CONSUMER PRICES AS A RESULT,
 POSE SOME RISKS TO THE ECONOMY.
 IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER OR NOT IF
 YOU CUT RATES, THAT THAT WOULD
 WORK ON THE SAME TIME FRAME THAT
 THE TRADE WAR IS DOING TO THE
 ECONOMY, BUT THE FACT THAT HE'S
 PULLED BACK A LITTLE BIT IF
 RECENT DAYS FROM CONFLICT WITH
 CHINA, THAT IN ITSELF IS GOOD
 NEWS FOR THE ECONOMY AND THIS IS
 ONE WAY HE CAN MAKE IT GO FASTER
 IF JAY POWELL DECIDED TO GO
 ALONG.
 OF COURSE JAY POWELL IS
 INDEPENDENT AND VALUES HIS
 REPUTATION FOR INDEPENDENCE AND
 WILL MAKE HIS OWN DECISION.
 YOU HAD A CHANCE TO SIT DOWN
 WITH BETO O'ROURKE AND TALK
 ABOUT SOME OF HIS ECONOMIC
 POLICIES.
 LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT YOUR
 EXPERIENCE AS A SMALL BUSINESS
 MAN, BOTH WEB SERVICES COMPANY.
 DO YOU LOOK UPON THAT AS A
 SUCCESS AND WHAT DO YOU TAKE
 FROM IT AS YOU THINK ABOUT THE
 ECONOMIC CHALLENGES OF THE
 COUNTRY?
 YEAH.
 SO I DO LOOK AT IT AS A SUCCESS,
 TO BE ABLE WITH GOOD FRIENDS,
 FAR MORE TALENTED AND SMARTER
 THAN I WAS TO COME TOGETHER AND
 CREATE OPPORTUNITY AND JOBS IN
 THE THIRD POOREST URBAN COUNTY
 IN THE UNITED STATES, HIGH
 VALUE, HIGH SKILL, HIGH-TECH
 JOBS IN EL PASO, TEXAS.
 THAT FELT GOOD.
 IT WAS HARD TO DO BUT I TELL YOU
 I HAD SOME ADVANTAGES THAT OTHER
 AMERICANS DON'T.
 I GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.
 I COULD NOT GET A LOAN IN 1998
 TO START A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY IN
 EL PASO.
 JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE ASSETS THAT
 THE BANK WOULD LEND AGAINST.
 BUT MY DAD, WHO HAD A HOME THAT
 WAS FULLY PAID FOR, COULD TAKE
 OUT A LOAN ON HIS HOME AND THEN
 LEND THAT MONEY BACK TO ME,

 THAT WAS THE SEED CAPITAL THAT
 ALLOWS TO START A BUSINESS THAT
 ULTIMATELY HIRED DOZENS OF OUR
 FELLOW EL PASOENS AND SERVED
 CLIENTS ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY.
 I OFTEN THINK THAT PEOPLE WHO
 HAVE SMALL BUSINESS EXPERIENCE
 COULD BE VERY USEFUL TO OUR
 COUNTRY.
 YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE MACRO
 ECONOMIC EXPERIENCE.
 WHAT WAS YOUR TAKEAWAY.
 YOU TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT
 BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS AND THEIR
 UNDERSTANDING OF IT ALL THE
 TIME.
 THAT'S A SELLING POINT FOR
 BETO O'ROURKE IN THIS RACE.
 HE STARTED A BUSINESS AND IT'S
 STILL GOING 20 YEARS LATER,
 PROFITABLE BUSINESS THAT THE
 PUBLISHING -THE ALT WEEKLY HE
 FOUNDED WENT OUT OF BUSINESS BUT
 THE TECH SERVICES COMPANY,
 THOUGH HE'S NO LONGER AN OWNER
 OF IT, IS CONTINUING TO OPERATE.
 THE POINT HE WENT ON TO MAKE IN
 THAT DISCUSSION WAS THAT HE IS
 MINDFUL THAT VERY FEW AMERICANS
 HAVE FAMILIES THAT CAN STAKE
 THEM TO $20,000 TO START A SMALL
 BUSINESS.
 A LOT OF HIS SMALL BUSINESS
 PROPOSALS ARE DESIGNED TO EXTEND
 MORE CREDIT, MORE TAX INCENTIVES
 TO COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHERE
 WEALTH INEQUALITY HAS SUPPRESSED
 THE FORMATION OF SMALL BUSINESS
 AND THAT'S A BIG TALKING POINT
 FOR HIM IN THE RACE.
 I SKIPPED LUNCH, WHICH IS A
 BAD IDEA, AND I KEPT WATCHING
 YOU WHILE YOU WERE EATING AND
 TRYING OUT WHAT YOU WERE EATING.
 I WAS EATING THE ENCHILADA
 PLATTER, HALF RED SAUCE, HALF
 GREEN SAUCE.
 IT WAS DELICIOUS.
 HE HAD TACOS, AS YOU CAN SEE,
 TALKING MOST OF THE TIME AND NOT
 INCLINED TO PICK THEM UP.
 I ENJOY INTERVIEWS WHERE
 SOMEONE ELSE IS TALKING AND I'M
 EATING.
 THANK YOU, JOHN HARWOOD, EDITOR
 AT LARGE AT CNBC.
 STILL TO COME THE PRESIDENT
 ONCE AGAIN BLAMES THE BORDER
 CRISIS ON DEMOCRATS SAYING
 THEY'RE TREATING BORDER AGENTS
 UNFAIRLY AND ACCUSED SOME
 LAWMAKERS OF LYING.
 REACTION FROM TEXAS DEMOCRAT
 CONGRESSMAN MARK VESEY WHO
 TOURED FACILITIES THIS WEEK.
 JOE BIDEN ADMITS HE WAS
 BLINDSIDED BY KAMALA HARRIS'
 CONFRONTATION AT THE DEBATE.
 DESPITE SLIDING POLLS HE SAYS
 HE'S STILL THE BEST PICK TO TAKE
 ON DONALD TRUMP.
                 LL THE BEST PICE ON DONALD TRUMP.
 Going to the Shawn Mendes Verizon UP concert
 was like an out of body experience.
   We were right in front of him. Dead center. Front row.
 'Cause actually, Zarmina, you touched Shawn Mendes.
             Yeah, I touched him! She touched Shawn Mendes!
             He like held my hand             for a while.
               And then we got               to meet him after,               which was like...
 Another surprise.                            Yeah.
   We love Verizon even more now.
                I'll never forget                that day. Ever.
 The network more people rely on,         gives you more.
    Like thousands of tickets           to concerts,
   festivals and private shows.
        And big savings on our best phones when you switch.
          <i> ♪ LiMu Emu ♪</i>           <i> And Doug.</i>
         That's Verizon.     What do all these people      have in common, LiMu?
        [ guttural grunt ]
        Exactly. Nothing!
       <i> They're completely</i>       <i> different people.</i>
         That's why they         make customized
          car insurance       from Liberty Mutual.
        They'll only pay       for what they need.
          Yes, and they        could save a ton.
   You've done it again, LiMu.         [ LiMu grunts ]

 ALL RIGHT. AS THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL
 CANDIDATES RACE TO QUALIFY FOR
 THE NEXT DEBATE, WE'VE GOT NEW
 FUNDRAISING NUMBERS TO REPORT.
 MOMENTS AGO, SENATOR KAMALA
 HARRIS' CAMPAIGN ANNOUNCED IT
 RAISED NEARLY $12 MILLION IN THE
 SECOND QUARTER.
 STILL IN THE LEAD SOUTH BEND,
 INDIANA, MAYOR PIECE BUTTIGIEG'S
 CAMPAIGN ANNOUNCED MONDAY IT
 RAISED $28.8 MILLION.
 FRONT RUNNER BIDEN WITH $21.5
 MILLION IN THE CORNER, STEVE
 BULLOCK, WHO ONLY ENTERED IN MID
 MAY AND MID-QUARTER RAISED A
 SURPRISING $2 MILLION.
 FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN
 ADDRESSING THOSE FIERY DEBATE
 COMMENTS FROM 2020 OPPONENT
 SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS
 CRITICIZING HIS DECADES OLD
 SENATE FIGHT AGAINST
 DESEGREGATION OF BUSSING AND HIS
 COMMENTS ON WORKING WITH
 SEGREGATIONIST SENATORS.
 IN A CNN INTERVIEW, BIDEN SAID
 HARRIS' COMMENTS WERE
 UNEXPECTED.
 SO EASY TO GO BACK AND GO
 BACK 30, 40, 50 YEARS AND TAKE
 THE CONTEXT AND TAKE IT
 COMPLETELY OUT OF CONTEXT.
 I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I GET ALL THIS
 INFORMATION ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE'S
 PAST AND WHAT THEY'VE DONE AND
 NOT DONE AND, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT
 GOING TO GO THERE.
 BIDEN ALSO EXPRESSED HIS
 CONFIDENCE IN DEFEATING
 PRESIDENT TRUMP.
 A NEW QUINNIPIAC UNIVERSITY
 NATIONAL POLL SHOWS HIS 42% LEAD
 IN THAT CATEGORY.
 THE IDEA THAT I WOULD BE
 INTIMIDATED BY DONALD TRUMP,
 HE'S THE BULLY THAT I KNEW MY
 WHOLE LIFE.
 HE'S THE BULLY THAT I'VE ALWAYS
 STOOD UP TO.
 HE'S THE BULLY THAT USED TO MAKE
 FUN WHEN I WAS A KID AND STUTTER
 AND I WOULD SMACK IN THE MOUTH.
 JOINING ME NOW IS POLITICAL
 REPORTER JUST IN TIME FOR ALI V.
 SEGMENT, ALI VITALI.
 I WOULD BE ALI VELSHI.
 TALK ABOUT HARRIS' CAMPAIGN
 TALKING ABOUT WHAT JOE BIDEN
 SAID, SAYING THIS WASN'T AN
 ATTACK.
 WELL, IT CLEARLY WAS AN
 ATTACK AND I THINK THAT THEY
 WERE DEFINITELY PREPARED FOR IT.
 WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT BEFORE.
 LILY ADAMS WAS ON CNN SAYING THE
 FACT THAT HE WASN'T PREPARED FOR
 IT, SHE'S NOT SURE WHY THAT
 HAPPENED BUT THE KAMALA HARRIS
 CAMP CAME IN AND THIS IS WHAT
 DEBATES ARE TO SEPARATE THE
 FIELD AND SHOW THE DIFFERENCES.
 THERE'S A RETICENCE ON JOE
 BIDEN'S PART TO BE APOLOGETIC
 FOR HIS PAST RECORD AND IT'S
 DIFFICULT TO RUN ON THE ARGUMENT
 OF ELECTABILITY AND EXPERIENCE
 WHEN YOU'RE NOT READY TO DEFEND
 THE EXPERIENCE PORTION OF IT.
 SPECIFICALLY, WHEN YOU LOOK AT
 30 YEARS OF POLICY MAKING
 DECISIONS, THINGS LOOK DIFFERENT
 OVER THE COURSE OF TIME.
 I COVERED A CANDIDATE WHO WAS
 RETICENT TO APOLOGIZE IN THE
 PAST, JOE BIDEN IS NOT DONALD
 TRUMP, AND I THINK THIS IS A
 STRATEGY I'M NOT SURE HOW
 EFFECTIVE IT'S GOING TO BE GOING
 DOWN THE LINE IN THIS CAMPAIGN
 AS THERE ARE GOING TO BE MORE
 POLICIES THAT COME UP ABOUT JOE
 BIDEN'S PAST THAT THE OTHER
 CANDIDATES WILL WANT TO
 LITIGATE.
 HARRIS IN THE POLLING WE WERE
 SHOWING SEEMS TO BE CLOSING THE
 GAP, HER NUMBERS HAVE SURGED 13
 POINTS, JOE BIDEN'S HAVE SURGED
 8 POINTS, BUT IN A DIFFERENT
 QUESTION WHEN PEOPLE ARE ASKED,
 WHO CAN BEAT DONALD TRUMP, JOE
 BIDEN STILL WAY AHEAD.
 I GUESS TO SOME DEGREE, KAMALA
 HARRIS TAKING ON JOE BIDEN IN
 THAT DEBATE WAS ABOUT SHOWING I
 CAN BEAT A FRONTRUNNER?
 MAYBE.
 I THINK THAT FOR A LOT OF THE
 CANDIDATES ON THAT STAGE WITH
 JOE BIDEN, THE REASON WHY THE
 CONVENTIONAL THINKING WAS IT'S A
 GOOD THING TO SHARE THE DEBATE
 STAGE WITH HIM BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY
 A LOT OF EYES ARE LOOKING AT
 HIM.
 WHEN YOU'RE COMING INTO THIS
 RACE AS JOE BIDEN OR BERNIE
 SANDERS, YOU HAVE A HIGH NAME
 RECOGNITION.
 THAT'S WHY I THINK IN A LOT OF
 EARLY POLLS YOU'RE SEEING THEM
 SO FAR OUT AHEAD.
 THEY HAVE LEADS NOW TO DEFEND.
 FOR THE OTHER CANDIDATES IT'S A
 MATTER OF INTRODUCING THEMSELVES
 TO AN ELECTORATE THAT MAY NOT BE
 AWARE OF THESE OTHER CANDIDATES
 THAT ARE IN THE RACE NOW.
 WHEN YOU SEE THESE POLLS
 TIGHTENING, I ACTUALLY DON'T
 KNOW THAT IT'S RISING LEVELS OF
 SUPPORT AND NOT SUPPORT.
 I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S JUST THE
 ELECTORATE TUNING IN AND SHOWING
 THAT THEY'RE BECOMING AWARE OF
 DIFFERENT PEOPLE.
 I THINK THAT AS WE GET FURTHER
 DOWN THE LINE, WE'RE GOING TO
 SEE A DEBATE IN JULY, A DEBATE
 IN SEPTEMBER, THAT'S WHEN WE'RE
 GOING TO START TO SEE A LOT MORE
 OF THE AWARENESS COMING INTO THE
 POLLS.
 AFTER THAT I WOULD FEEL
 COMFORTABLE LOOKING AT POLLS AND
 SAYING THESE ARE TRENDS THAT ARE
 STICKING.
 THIS IS FOR US RIGHT NOW,
 PEOPLE WHO WATCH THIS ALL THE
 TIME.
 EXACTLY.
 OKAY.
 MY EXECUTIVE PRODUCER INFORMS ME
 YOU'RE ALI VIE TELE.
 GOOD TO SEE YOU, MY FRIEND.
 YOU TOO.
 THEY WILL PAUSE THEIR FIGHT
 OVER PAST EDUCATION POLICY TO
 TALK ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF
 AMERICA'S PUBLIC SCHOOLS.
 THEY'RE SCHEDULED TO JOIN EIGHT
 OTHER CANDIDATES AT THE NATIONAL
 EDUCATION ASSOCIATION'S STRONG
 PUBLIC SCHOOLS PRESIDENTIAL
 FORUM IN HOUSTON.
 THE CONTENDERS WILL ANSWER
 QUESTIONS FROM CLASSROOM
 TEACHERS AND OTHER EDUCATIONAL
 PROFESSIONALS.
 NBC'S -MSNBC'S MARIANA JOINS
 US FROM HOUSTON.
 THE FORUM WILL BEGIN AT THE TOP
 OF THE HOUR.
 SOME OF THE CANDIDATES HAVE
 OUTLINED PLANS TO IMPROVE THE
 EDUCATION SYSTEM AND YOU'VE HAD
 A CHANCE TO TALK WITH EDUCATORS
 WHO WERE AT THE EVENT.
 WHAT ARE THEY LOOKING FOR AND
 WHAT ARE THE ATTENDEES LOOKING
 FOR FROM THE PRESIDENTIAL
 CANDIDATES?
 ALI, EDUCATORS WANT TO
 KNOW FROM THE CANDIDATES HOW
 THEY PLAN TO INCREASE TEACHER
 PAY, FIRST OF ALL.
 WE'VE SEEN TEACHERS FOR THE MOST
 PART RALLY AND STRIKE ACROSS THE
 COUNTRY FOR INCREASED TEACHER
 PAY, BUT ALSO HOW THE CANDIDATES
 WILL INCREASE FUNDING FOR
 EDUCATION, HOW THEY'RE GOING TO
 MAKE EDUCATORS STAY IN THE
 CLASSROOM.
 MANY TEACHERS HERE TELL ME THEY
 HAVE TO WORK TWO, THREE JOBS
 JUST TO BE AN EDUCATOR AND
 HAVING TO PUT THEIR OWN MONEY
 TOWARDS BUYING TEXTBOOKS AND
 SCHOOL SUPPLIES.
 HOW THE CANDIDATES WILL IMPROVE
 CONDITIONS IN CLASSROOMS.
 IT GOES BEYOND EDUCATION.
 I SPOKE TO ONE TEACHER NAMED
 CHRISTINA FROM DENVER, COLORADO,
 WHO TELLS ME SHE HAS A CLASSROOM
 OF MIXED STATUS KIDS, A LOT OF
 LATINO FAMILIES, SO SHE'S ALSO
 INTERESTED TO KNOW ABOUT THE
 CANDIDATES' IMMIGRATION
 PROPOSALS BECAUSE WHATEVER THEY
 DO WILL INEVITABLY AFFECT THE
 KIDS IN HER CLASSROOM.
 FINALLY, WHAT YOU WERE TALKING
 WITH ALI V., CHATTER HERE ABOUT
 THAT CONTESTED EXCHANGE OVER
 RACE BETWEEN BIDEN AND HARRIS.
 A LOT OF EDUCATORS ALSO WANT TO
 SEE WHAT BOTH OF OF THEM WILL
 TALK ABOUT REGARDING THAT AT THE
 FORUM TODAY.
 ALI?
 I APPRECIATE THAT.
 THANK YOU.
 WE'RE GOING TO CHECK IN WITH YOU
 A LITTLE BIT LATER.
 A QUICK PROGRAMMING NOTE IN
 THE NEXT HOUR I'M GOING TO BE
 TALKING LIVE TO SENATOR AMY
 KLOBUCHAR, ONE OF THE 2020
 CONTENDERS ATTENDING TODAY'S
 FORUM IN HOUSTON, GOING TO TALK
 ABOUT HER PUBLIC EDUCATION
 POLICIES, 3:00 P.M. EASTERN
 RIGHT HERE ON MSNBC.
 ALL RIGHT.
 THE PRESIDENT SAYS I.C.E. AGENTS
 WILL SOON BEGIN A NATIONWIDE
 ROUNDUP OF UNDOCUMENTED
 IMMIGRANTS AND CLAIM BORDER
 FACILITIES ARE CLEAN, FINE AND
 ONLY OVERCROWDED BECAUSE OF
 DEMOCRATS.
 TEXAS DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN
 MARC VEASEY WHO TOURED
 FACILITIES, DETENTION
 FACILITIES, JOINS ME NEXT.
 YOU'RE WATCHING MSNBC.
     children in urgent need.
  It's not just about opening up            your home;
    it is also about opening up            your heart.
        Consider fostering.

       ♪ Nausea, heartburn,       indigestion,
    upset stomach, diarrhea. ♪
   Get powerful relief with new   Pepto Bismol Liquicaps.
    This is your wake-up call.
     If you have moderate to   severe rheumatoid arthritis,
        month after month,
     the clock is ticking on    irreversible joint damage.
    Ongoing pain and stiffness
   are signs of joint erosion.
 HUMIRA can help stop the clock.
     Prescribed for 15 years,
   HUMIRA targets and blocks a      source of inflammation
  that contributes to joint pain     and irreversible damage.
      HUMIRA can lower your   ability to fight infections.
      Serious and sometimes         fatal infections
     including tuberculosis,           and cancers,
       including lymphoma,          have happened;
      as have blood, liver,   and nervous system problems,
   serious allergic reactions,
       and new or worsening          heart failure.
       Tell your doctor if       you've been to areas
 where certain fungal infections           are common,
      and if you've had TB,
           hepatitis B,
     are prone to infections,
         or have flu-like        symptoms or sores.
        Don't start HUMIRA    if you have an infection.
       Help stop the clock
     on further irreversible          joint damage.
   Talk to your rheumatologist.
      Right here. Right now.
             HUMIRA.
 I DON'T CALL THEM RAIDS.
 I SAY THEY CAME IN ILLEGALLY AND
 WE'RE BRINGING THEM OUT LEGALLY.
 PEOPLE WHERE WE HAVE THE PAPERS,
 HAVE GONE THROUGH THE COURT
 SYSTEM AND THEY WILL BE STARTING
 FAIRLY SOON.
 I DON'T CALL THEM RAIDS.
 THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF
 PEOPLE WILL BE LEGALLY REMOVED
 IN THE COUNTRY AND THAT PROCESS
 HAS STARTED.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP ANNOUNCED HE
 WOULD BE CARRYING OUT HIS
 INITIATIVE TO ROUND UP AND MASS
 DEPORT THOUSANDS OF UNDOCUMENTED
 MIGRANTS TO THEIR HOME COUNTRIES
 SOON TWO WEEKS AFTER HE CALLED
 OFF THREAT AND RAID TS SEE IF
 THE DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS
 CAN GET TOGETHER AND WORK OUT A
 SOLUTION TO THE ASYLUM AND
 LOOPHOLE PROBLEMS AT THE
 SOUTHERN BORDER.
 AT THE G-20 SUMMIT HE SAID
 IMMIGRATION RAIDS WOULD LIKELY
 TAKE PLACE SOME TIME AFTER THE
 JULY 4th HOLIDAY.
 IT COMES AS MORE REPORTS REVEAL
 THAT ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN
 SENDING HEFTY FINES OF UP TO
 NEARLY $500,000 TO MIGRANTS WHO
 SEEK REFUGE IN PLACES OF
 WORSHIP.
 JOINING ME IS MARC VEASEY WHO
 TRAVELED TO EL PASO TO VISIT
 SEVERAL DETENTION FACILITIES IN
 THE AREA.
 THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.
 ALI.
 THE PRESIDENT HAS IMPLIED
 THAT WHAT CONGRESSMEN ARE
 SEEING, HOW DOES THAT COMPARE TO
 WHAT OTHER MEMBERS OF CONGRESS
 HAVE TOLD US AND OUR OWN
 REPORTERS HAVE SEEN ABOUT
 OVERCROWDING AND SHORTAGE OF
 FOOD AND BLANKETS AND THINGS
 LIKE THAT?
 RIGHT.
 EXACTLY.
 I WAS ON THE TRIP TO EL PASO
 SEVERAL DAYS AGO, AND WE VISITED
 ONE OF THE DETENTION CENTERS
 THERE THAT WAS UNDER A LOT OF
 SCRUTINY AND WHAT WE SAW WAS, AT
 LEAST ONE HOLDING CELL THAT WAS
 CROWDED.
 THEY HAD CUBAN MIGRANTS THAT
 WERE PLACED IN THIS PARTICULAR
 CELL AND THEY TOLD US THE REASON
 THEY WERE IN SUCH AN OVERCROWDED
 CELL BECAUSE THE CUBANS DIDN'T
 MIX WELL WITH THE OTHER PEOPLE
 FROM LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES
 AND WANTED TO KEEP THEM TOGETHER
 IN THE CELL.
 THEY WERE CRYING, THEY WERE SAD.
 ONE GRANDMOTHER TOLD A STORY OF
 HER MENTALLY IMPAIRED GRANDSON
 BEING SEPARATED FROM HER AND
 THEY DID TELL MEMBERS OF THE
 DELEGATION THAT WHEN THEY ASKED
 FOR WATER, THAT THEY WERE TOLD
 TO DRINK OUT OF THE TOILET.
 I HAVE TO TELL YOU, BASED ON
 THIS FACEBOOK PAGE THAT CAME OUT
 AND THAT STORY ACTUALLY BROKE
 WHILE WE WERE ON OUR TRIP TO EL
 PASO, I BELIEVE THE BORDER
 PATROL AGENTS DID TELL THEM.
 I DO BELIEVE --
 TELL ME THE CONNECTION
 BETWEEN THE TWO.
 YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE ALMOST
 10,000 PEOPLE ON THIS FACEBOOK
 PAGE IN WHICH IT HAS CUSTOMS AND
 BORDER PROTECTION EMPLOYEES AND
 OFFICERS SAYING DISPARAGING,
 SEXIST, RACIST, MISOGYNISTIC
 THINGS ABOUT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS
 AND MIGRANTS, ASYLUM SEEKERS,
 EVEN PEOPLE CROSSING THE RIVER.
 RIGHT.
 YES.
 I THINK IT'S A BROADER PART OF
 THE CULTURE THERE AND NOW IT'S
 BROKEN THEY HAVE KNOWN ABOUT
 THIS PAGE PERHAPS FOR UP TO
 THREE YEARS AND THIS WAS -AND
 THEY WERE NOT SURPRISED ABOUT
 THIS.
 WHEN WE GOT THERE AND TALKED
 WITH THE CUSTOM AND BORDER
 PATROL PEOPLE IN CHARGE OF OUR
 TOUR THEY TOLD US OH, MY GOD,
 WE'VE NEVER HEARD OF THIS.
 COME ON, THREE YEARS.
 IF THAT'S TRUE, THEN THAT MEANS
 THAT WE WERE LIED TO, MEMBERS OF
 CONGRESS WERE LIED TO ON THE
 TRIP ABOUT THIS PAGE.
 AGAIN, THE FACT THAT THEY WOULD
 BE MEAN TO PEOPLE AND THAT THERE
 WERE KIDS THAT WERE IN
 OVERCROWDED CONDITIONS THAT WERE
 WALKING AROUND WITH MUCUS FILLED
 SHIRTS, STORIES TOLD TO US,
 STORIES THAT IN MY OPINION WERE
 BACKED UP BY THE I.G.'S REPORT
 AND THE ACTING HOMELAND
 SECRETARY SAID THE CONDITIONS
 THERE ARE NOT GOOD.
 I MEAN EVERYTHING THAT I'VE
 HEARD FROM THE MIGRANTS WHEN I
 WAS ON MY TRIP I 100% BELIEVE.
 CONGRESSMAN, THE PRESIDENT
 TALKED ABOUT IT THIS MORNING, HE
 SAYS, MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ARE
 ATTACKING BORDER PATROL.
 LET'S LISTEN.
 I'VE SEEN SOME OF THOSE
 PLACES AND THEY ARE RUN
 BEAUTIFULLY.
 THEY'RE CLEAN.
 THEY'RE GOOD.
 THEY DO A GREAT JOB.
 YOUR OWN GOVERNMENT --
 THEY DO A GREAT JOB.
 THEY'RE CROWDED BECAUSE THE
 DEMOCRATS WILL NOT GIVE US ANY
 RELIEF FROM THESE LOOPHOLES.
 WE HAVE LOOPHOLES THAT ARE SO
 BAD, WE HAVE ASYLUM THAT'S SO
 BAD.
 I THINK THAT THE BORDER PATROL
 HAS BEEN TREATED VERY, VERY
 BADLY BY CERTAIN MEMBERS OF
 CONGRESS.
 VERY, VERY BADLY.
 FOR THE MOST PART THEY'RE VERY
 RESPECTED BY CONGRESS BUT
 CERTAIN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS SAY
 VERY BAD THINGS AND LIE AND
 EXAGGERATE.
 WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT
 THAT, CONGRESSMAN?
 HE'S SAYING THAT CERTAIN MEMBERS
 OF CONGRESS LIE AND EXAGGERATE
 BUT THIS WASN'T -THIS BORDER
 PATROL STUFF WASN'T ACTUALLY
 REPORTED BY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS,
 IT WAS REPORTED BY SOMEBODY IN
 THAT GROUP WHO LEAKED IT TO
 PROPUBLICA.
 THAT IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
 AND YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT HAS
 NEVER SEEN A LIE THAT HE DIDN'T
 LIKE.
 AND RIGHT NOW HE'S JUST
 SPINNING, HE'S PLAYING POLITICS
 LIKE HE'S BEEN PLAYING POLITICS
 WITH THESE MIGRANTS AND
 ABSOLUTELY, ALI, EVERYTHING THAT
 I'VE HEARD ABOUT AND EVERYTHING
 THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS, YOU
 KNOW -ALMOST LIKE TRYING TO
 PIT THE BORDER PATROL AGENTS AND
 TRYING TO MAKE THIS A POLITICAL
 ISSUE.
 I WILL TELL YOU THAT THERE WAS
 ANOTHER BORDER PATROL AGENT, YOU
 MAY HAVE SAW THE INTERVIEW, AND
 HE EVEN BACKED UP THE DEPLORABLE
 CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE MIGRANTS
 WERE LIVING IN.
 SO I DON'T SEE THIS AS AN ISSUE
 OF DEMOCRAT VERSUS BORDER PATROL
 AGENTS.
 I THINK THERE ARE SOME AGENTS
 THERE THAT FEEL LIKE THEY ARE
 EMPOWERED TO DO ANYTHING THEY
 WANT TO DO BECAUSE OF THE
 DIRECTION THAT THEY GET FROM THE
 EXECUTIVE BRANCH, FROM THE
 STATEMENTS THAT COME OUT OF THE
 PRESIDENT'S MOUTH, FROM THE
 ACTIONS THAT COME OUT OF THE
 PRESIDENT'S IMMIGRATION POLICY
 PEOPLE.
 LIKE STEPHEN MILLER.
 I THINK THAT SORT OF CULTURE HAS
 BEEN ALLOWED TO EXIST THERE.
 I BY NO MEANS THINK THAT EVERY
 BORDER PATROL AGENT IS A BAD
 PERSON.
 WE EVEN HEARD FROM LAWYERS AND
 OTHER PEOPLE BEFORE WE BEGAN OUR
 TOUR IN EL PASO THAT WANTED TO
 LET US KNOW SOME OF THESE BORDER
 PATROL AGENTS ARE MEMBERS OF THE
 COMMUNITY AND GOOD STANDING, WE
 WORK WITH THEM, THAT THEY WERE
 PART OF THEIR FAMILIES AND THAT
 THEY CERTAINLY DID NOT PAINT
 THEM WITH A BROAD BRUSH AND I'M
 NOT TRYING TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW.
 I'M SAYING THAT THEY HAVE A
 PROBLEM THERE AND IT NEEDS TO BE
 ROOTED OUT.
 I'M VERY HAPPY ELIJAH CUMMINGS
 IS GOING TO HEAR A HEARING ON
 OVERSIGHT AND INVESTIGATION SO
 WE CAN LOOK INTO SOME OF THESE
 ALLEGATIONS WITH THE FACEBOOK
 PAGE AND OVERCROWDED CONDITIONS.
 THANK YOU FOR TAKING TIME TO
 DISCUSS WITH US, REPRESENTATIVE
 MARC VEASEY OF TEXAS.

 WITH IRAN GO FROM BAD TO WORSE

 THE UK IN THE CROSS HEIRS AFTER

 IRAN HAS THREATENED TO SOOEZ AN OIL TANKER AFTER AUTHORITIES
 DETAINED AN IRANIAN OIL TANKER
 ON THURSDAY.
 THE SHIP BREACHED EUROPEAN UNION
 SANCTIONS CARRYING A SHIPMENT OF
 CRUDE OIL TO SYRIA AND IRANIAN
 AUTHORITIES BELIEVE THE BRITISH
 WERE ACTING ON INTELLIGENCE FROM
 THE UNITED STATES WHEN THEY
 SEIZED THE SHIP.
 IT COMES AS HASSAN ROUHANI SAID
 HIS COUNTRY WILL BEGIN ENRICHING
 URANIUM AS EARLY AS SUNDAY TO A
 LEVEL THAT WOULD EXCEED THE
 LEVEL SPECIFIED UNDER THE 2015
 NUCLEAR ACCORD.
 LET'S BRING IN BUREAU CHIEF ALI
 ARUZI.
 THIS IS A TRICKY ONE BECAUSE
 MUCH OF THE SYRIAN REGIME
 DESPISED AROUND THE WORLD AND
 EVEN IN THE REGION IS SUPPORTED
 BY THE IRANIANS SO IT WOULD BE
 LOGICAL TO SOME PEOPLE TO THINK
 THAT IRAN IS SUPPLYING OIL TO
 SYRIA.
 WHAT DO WE THOUGH ABOUT WHAT
 HAPPENED HERE?
 WELL, ALI, WHAT WE KNOW IS
 THAT THIS WAS IRAN SAID THEY
 OWNED AND IT WAS TAKING CRUDE
 OIL TO SYRIA, BUT IT WAS TAKING
 A VERY CURIOUS ROUTE TO SYRIA.
 INSTEAD OF GOING THROUGH THE
 SUEZ CANAL, WHICH WOULD BE A
 MASSIVE SHORTCUT FOR THIS
 SUPERTANKER TO TAKE, IT WENT
 AROUND THE TIP OF AFRICA ALL THE
 WAY UP TOWARDS THE MEDITERRANEAN
 COAST OF SYRIA WHERE IT WAS
 SEIZED IN GIBRALTAR BY BRITISH
 MARINES.
 NOW IT'S VERY ODD THAT IT WOULD
 TAKE THIS ROUTE.
 SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT THIS
 MAY BE A SMOKE SCREEN BY THE
 IRANIANS TO DISGUISE ITS ROUTE
 BECAUSE IT'S NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE
 OIL FROM TO SYRIA BECAUSE OF EU
 SANCTIONS AND THE BRITISH WERE
 TIPPED OFF BY THE UNITED STATES
 THAT THIS CARGO WAS HEADING TO
 SYRIA.
 SOME 30 BRITISH MARINES THEN
 BOARDED THE SHIP, THEY BOARDED
 IT BY ROPES COMING DOWN ON
 HELICOPTERS, WHILE OTHERS CAME
 ON SPEED BOATS, AND NOW THE SHIP
 IS BEING HELD IN GIBRALTAR
 WATERS.
 THE CREW OF THE SHIP ARE BEING
 QUESTIONED.
 IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER THEY'RE
 BEING QUESTIONED ON LAND OR ON
 THE SEA.
 INCIDENTALLY MOST OF THE CREW
 ARE PAKISTANIS AND INDIANS, NOT
 IRANIANS, THEY'RE NOT BEING
 TREATED AS CRIMINALS BUT RATHER
 AS WITNESSES.
 NOW THE AUTHORITIES IN GIBRALTAR
 HAVE SAID THEY ARE GOING TO KEEP
 THE SHIP FOR ANOTHER TWO WEEKS
 UNTIL THE INVESTIGATION COMES TO
 AN END, BUT IRAN IS, OBVIOUSLY,
 UP IN ARMS.
 THEY ARE SAYING THAT THIS IS AN
 ACT OF PIRACY BY THE BRITISH AND
 AN IRANIAN COMMANDER
 REVOLUTIONARY GUARD COMMANDER IS
 SAYING THAT A BRITISH OIL TANKER
 SHOULD BE SEIZED IN RETALIATION.
 ALL RIGHT.
 ALI, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
 NBC NEWS TEHRAN BUREAU CHIEF.
 THE SITUATION WITH IRAN IS
 ONE OF THE CRISES THE PRESIDENT
 IS DEALING WITH, TRYING TO REACH
 AN AGREEMENT WITH CHINA TO END
 THE TRADE WAR AND A DEAL WITH
 NORTH KOREA TO CURB ITS NUCLEAR
 PROGRAM WHILE DEMOCRATS AND SOME
 REPUBLICANS HAVE CRITICIZED THE
 PRESIDENT'S HANDLING OF FOREIGN
 POLICY ISSUES, HIS CORE
 SUPPORTERS STILL APPEAR TO BE ON
 BOARD WITH HIS EFFORTS.
 JOINING US TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK
 AT THIS IS HENRY OLSON, HENRY IS
 A SENIOR FELLOW AT THE ETHICS
 AND PUBLIC POLICY CENTER AND AN
 OPINION COLUMNIST FOR THE
 "WASHINGTON POST" AND WROTE A
 COLUMN ON THIS ISSUE THAT WAS
 PUBLISHED LAST WEEK.
 HENRY, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
 THANKS FOR HAVING ME ON.
 I WANT TO READ A LITTLE BIT
 FROM THE COLUMN THAT YOU
 PUBLISHED IN WHICH YOU SAY ABOUT
 DONALD TRUMP, HIS FANS NOT
 SURPRISINGLY TAKE A DIFFERENT
 VIEW.
 MOST DON'T SUBSCRIBE TO THE
 TRUMP AS SUPERMAN FANTASY,
 INSTEAD THEY RECOGNIZE THAT
 EXPERTS HAVE BEEN IN CHARGE OF
 U.S. FOREIGN POLICY FOR DECADES
 AND THEY ARGUE WE HAVE LITTLE TO
 SHOW FOR IT.
 NORTH KOREA HAS NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
 CHINA HAS EMERGED AS A DANGEROUS
 GEOPOLITICAL FOE.
 IN THEIR VIEW, TRUMP'S DRAMATIC
 BREAKS WITH THE PAST COULD BE
 THE ONLY CHANCE THE UNITED
 STATES HAS TO AVERT DANGEROUS
 CONFLICTS WITH ONE OR BOTH
 NATIONS.
 BETTER TO TAKE A CHANCE ON HIM,
 THEY REASON, THAN HOPE MORE OF
 THE SAME WILL YIELD DIFFERENT
 RESULTS.
 I THINK THAT'S A REMARKABLY
 SOPHISTICATED VIEW OF WHAT MIGHT
 BE HAPPENING.
 DO YOU THINK THAT DONALD TRUMP'S
 BASE HOLDS THAT VIEW OF HOW HE
 HANDLES FOREIGN AFFAIRS?
 I THINK THE PRESIDENT'S BASE
 IS VERY SUPPORTIVE OF HIM.
 THEY THINK HE HAS AMERICA'S BEST
 INTEREST AT HEART.
 THEY THINK HE'S NOT GOING TO BE
 SOMEBODY WHO SECONDS AMERICAN
 BOYS AND GIRLS TO DIE FOR AN
 ALLY'S INTEREST THAT'S NOT
 IMMEDIATELY IN AMERICA'S
 INTERESTS AND I THINK THEY ARE
 WILLING TO TAKE SOME PAIN OR
 TAKE SOME RISKS IN ORDER TO
 CONFRONT CHINA AN NORTH KOREA.
 THE POLLS HAVE SHOWN FOR YEARS
 THAT BEING CRITICAL TOWARDS
 CHINA IS A WINNER, PARTICULARLY
 IN THE MIDWEST, AND PARTICULARLY
 WITH THE PEOPLE WHO MOVE FROM
 DEMOCRATIC TO REPUBLICAN TO
 SUPPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP.
 SO I THINK THEY'RE SUPPORTIVE OF
 HIM AND WILLING TO GIVE HIM A
 LOT OF ROPE AND A LOT OF
 OPPORTUNITIES TO SHOW THAT HE'S
 DOING THE RIGHT THING?
 IN BOTH OF THESE CASES A LOT
 OF ROPE HAS BEEN CEDED.
 IN CHINA WE'RE REPORTING ON
 FARMERS WHO ARE SUFFERING
 BECAUSE THEIR CROP PRICES ARE
 LOW, GETTING SOME REIMBURSEMENTS
 FROM THE GOVERNMENT, BUT EVERY
 LAST FARMER WE TALKED TO SAID I
 WOULD RATHER HAVE MONEY FROM MY
 CROPS.
 WHEN WE TALK TO THEM THEY SAY
 WE'RE STILL STICKING BY THE
 PRESIDENT.
 WHEN DOES THAT RUN OUT, THAT
 GOODWILL?
 I THINK IT MAY NOT RUN OUT
 VERY QUICKLY.
 I THINK YOU'VE GOT PEOPLE WHO
 RECOGNIZE THAT THIS HAS BEEN A
 LONG TIME COMING.
 CHINA EXCEEDED TO THE WTO ALMOST
 20 YEARS AGO.
 MILLIONS OF PEOPLE HAVE LOST
 THEIR JOBS, ACCORDING TO M.I.T.
 AND UNIVERSITY OF SAN DIEGO
 ECONOMISTS BECAUSE OF CHINESE
 IMPORT COMPETITION, AND FACT
 THAT SOME FARMERS ARE LOSING
 MONEY THEY CAN LOOK AROUND AND
 SEE THAT THEIR NEIGHBORS LOST A
 LOT MORE THAN THEY DID.
 I THINK AS LONG AS THE PRESIDENT
 IS FIRM AND AS LONG AS THE
 PRESIDENT IS CONSISTENT, THAT
 THE ROPE THEY GIVE HIM MAY BE
 EXTENDED FOR QUITE A WHILE
 LONGER.
 I MEAN, THESE FARMERS LIVE ON
 A RAZOR'S EDGE OF MARGINS.
 ARE YOU SAYING IT MIGHT BE
 ANOTHER YEAR OR TWO THAT THEY'LL
 STICK BY THE PRESIDENT?
 I THINK IT DEPENDS.
 IT DEPENDS ON WHAT PRESIDENT
 DOES.
 THE THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT
 THE FARMERS RECEIVE A LOT OF
 GOVERNMENT SUPPORT.
 THEY RECEIVE REVENUE SUPPORT,
 THAT SOYBEAN FARMERS IN
 PARTICULAR AND CORN FARMERS ARE
 ABLE TO BUY INTO A GOVERNMENT
 FINANCED INSURANCE PROGRAM THAT
 GUARANTEES THEIR REVENUES.
 PLUS THEY HAVE A PRICE SUPPORT
 PROGRAM.
 PLUS THEY HAVE A DISASTER
 PROGRAM.
 THIS IS A GROUP THAT MAY PREFER
 TO SELL TO STEADY MARKETS BUT
 THEY HAVE A LOT OF SUPPORT FROM
 THE GOVERNMENT, PLUS THE
 TEMPORARY SUPPORT THAT THE
 PRESIDENT HAS BEEN ADDING TO SEE
 THEM THROUGH OVER THE NEXT
 COUPLE YEARS.
 HENRY, GOOD TO TALK TO YOU
 AND WE'LL CONTINUE THIS
 CONVERSATION ANOTHER TIME.
 HENRY OLSON IS VICE PRESIDENT
 AND DIRECTOR AT THE NATIONAL
 RESEARCH INITIATIVE.
 TODAY GOOD NEWS FROM THE
 MONTHLY JOBS REPORT.
 200,000 JOBS ARE ADDED, FURTHER
 PROOF OUR ECONOMY IS STRONG, BUT
 WHY DOESN'T IT SEEM TO BE
 WORKING FOR EVERYONE?
 THAT IS THE BIG QUESTION.
 YOU'RE WATCHING MSNBC.
  I have one kid in each branch         of the military,
     but I'm command central.
     It's so important to us           that Verizon
 is supporting military families.
  When I have a child deployed,
    having a reliable network        means everything.
   So, when I get a video chat,
   and I get to see their face,
       it's the best thing          in the world.
    And I've earned every one       of these gray hairs.
   Military moms, we serve too.
 The network more people rely on,         gives you more.
     Like military plans with  a special price on Unlimited,
  $100 per line, and big savings
        on our best phones         when you switch.
         That's Verizon.
     When I book at Hilton.com
      I get to select my room      from the floor plan...
           Free Wi-Fi...
         ...and the Price         Match Guarantee.
          So with Hilton        there is no catch.
        Yeah the only catch       is I'm never leaving.
          No I'm serious,         I live here now.
        <i> Book at Hilton.com</i>
        <i> and get the Hilton</i>      <i> Price Match Guarantee.</i>
 LONGEST PERIOD OF ECONOMIC EXPANSION ON RECORD.
 BUT THERE IS A WIDENING GAP
 BETWEEN THE RICHEST AMERICANS
 AND EVERYONE ELSE.
 MUCH OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH
 WEALTH AND THE ABILITY FOR THE
 MIDDLE CLASS OF AMERICA TO
 ATTAIN IT.
 LET'S JUST DISCUSS WHAT THIS IS.
 WEALTHIER ASSETS, I THINK
 EVERYONE KNOWS THIS, YOUR HOME,
 YOUR DURABLE GOODS LIKE YOUR
 TVs, YOUR REFRIGERATORS, ANY
 STOCKS AND PENSION PLANS, IF YOU
 OWN A BUSINESS.
 ALL OF THAT MINUS YOUR
 LIABILITIES THINGS LIKE YOUR
 MORTGAGE, CREDIT CARD DEBT, CAR
 PAYMENTS, THAT'S YOUR WEALTH,
 YOUR ASSETS MINUS YOUR
 LIABILITIES.
 MORE THAN A THIRD OF GAINS IN
 HOUSEHOLD WEALTH WENT TO THE
 WEALTHIEST 1% OVER THE PAST
 DECADE.
 THIS ACTUALLY GOES ALL THE WAY
 TO 1989, AND YOU CAN SEE THE TOP
 1% HERE AND THE BOTTOM 50% HERE
 WERE IN UNISON UNTIL THE
 MID-90s.
 REMEMBER THAT'S WHEN CHINA
 JOINED THE WORLD TRADE
 ORGANIZATION.
 WE STARTED BUYING MORE STUFF
 FROM THEM.
 GLOBALIZATION AND TECHNOLOGY
 TOOK HOLD.
 THE TOP 1% ENDED UP WITH THESE
 GAINS.
 THE CHART SHOWS THE FOURTH
 QUARTER TOTAL NET WORTH OF THE
 TOP 1% OF WEALTH HOLDERS AND THE
 BOTTOM 50%.
 THESE FIGURES BY THE WAY ARE IN
 MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
 AS YOU CAN SEE, THE BOTTOM 50%
 BARELY, BARELY MAKING ANY GAINS
 AT ALL.
 IN FACT FOR A LITTLE WHILE HERE
 IN THE 2000s, THEY WERE MAKING
 NEGATIVE GAINS, THEY WERE LOSING
 WEALTH.
 SO WHAT'S CAUSING THIS DRAMATIC
 DISPARITY?
 THE "ASSOCIATED PRESS" ANALYZED
 THAT FEWER MIDDLE CLASS
 AMERICANS ARE OWNING HOMES.
 THE PRICE GAINS IF YOU OWN A
 HOME HAS MADE HOME OWNERSHIP
 LESS FEASIBLE FOR NEW BUYERS.
 SO IF YOU HAD A HOME, YOU'VE
 DONE WELL.
 IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE A HOME, THE
 PRICES HAVE MADE IT HARD TO GET
 IN.
 BUT THEN THE RECESSION OCCURRED
 AND NEARLY 8 MILLION AMERICANS
 LOST THEIR HOMES.
 SINCE THEN PRICES HAVE AGAIN
 RISEN DRAMATICALLY IN PLACES
 LIKE WEALTHY METRO AREAS,
 ESPECIALLY ALONG THE COASTS.
 IN 2004, MIDDLE-CLASS HOME
 OWNERSHIP RATES STOOD AT ABOUT

 IN 2016, WE ARE NOW AT ABOUT

 SO THAT'S ONE AREA OF WEALTH.
 THERE IS ALSO THE ISSUE OF LOW
 PARTICIPATION IN THE STOCK
 MARKET.
 WE TALK A LOT ABOUT THE STOCK
 MARKET.
 THE PRESIDENT TALKS A LOT ABOUT
 THE STOCK MARKET, BUT THE
 PROPORTION OF MIDDLE-INCOME
 HOUSEHOLDS THAT OWNS SHARES HAS
 ACTUALLY DECLINED.
 IN 200756% OF MIDDLE CLASS
 AMERICANS OWNED SHARES.
 AND BY THE WAY IN 2016, THAT
 DROPPED TO 50%.
 THIS DECLINE IS ATTRIBUTED TO
 MORE MIDDLE-INCOME WORKERS
 TAKING JOBS THAT DON'T HAVE
 RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLANS AS WELL
 AS EXPENSES LIKE HEALTH CARE AND
 STUDENT LOAN DEBT WHICH ARE
 TAKING THOSE BILLS, THAT MONEY,
 THAT WOULD HAVE GONE TO
 INVESTMENT.
 NOW COMPARE THAT INVESTMENT RATE
 TO THE TOP 10%.
 ALMOST EVERYBODY IN THE TOP 10%
 OWNS STOCK.
 IN 2007 THE NUMBER WAS 93%.
 IT IS UP TO THE 95% IN 2016.
 SO THIS IS WEALTH DISPARITY.
 JOINING ME NOW IS WASHINGTON
 POST" ECONOMICS CORRESPONDENT
 HEATHER LONG.
 HER RECENT OP ED SPEAKS DIRECTLY
 TO IISSUE.
 AND, HEATHER, THE SIMPLE
 QUESTION IS THAT IN SHORTHAND,
 IF MAR TAKENS CAME DOWN TO EARTH
 AND SAID HOW IS YOUR ECONOMY
 DOING, THE SHORT ANSWER WOULD
 HAVE TO BE GOOD.
 ONLY IF THEY ASKED A SECOND
 QUESTION WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO
 SAY, BUT IT IS NOT EVENLY
 DISTRIBUTED.
 AS I TRAVELED THE COUNTRY,
 THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I HEAR.
 AMERICAN LET'S TELL YOU THAT
 THIS IS DEFINITELY A BETTER
 ECONOMY THAN IT WAS IN 2008 AND
 '09 DURING THE GREAT RECESSION.
 BUT THE NEXT BUT OUT OF THEIR
 MOUTH IS THEY STILL FEEL A LOT
 OF ANXIETY.
 AND IN OUR STORY TODAY WE CALL
 IT 40% OF AMERICANS ARE STILL
 STRUGGLING TO PAY THEIR BILLS
 WHICH SEEMS LIKE A VERY
 UNUSUALLY HIGH STATISTIC IN A
 MOMENT WHEN WE HAVE SUCH A LOW
 EMPLOYMENT RATE AND THE
 PRESIDENT KEEPS TALKING ABOUT A
 BLUE COLLAR JOBS BOOM.
 SO WHY DO WE STILL HAVE THIS
 BOTTOM 40% THAT'S STILL HURTING
 SO MUCH?
 AND THERE'S REALLY TWO PARTS TO
 IT.
 YOU JUST WALKED THROUGH THE
 WEALTH SO WELL.
 PEOPLE DON'T HAVE AS MUCH OF A
 CUSHION AS THEY DID BEFORE.
 WE HAVE HALF THE POPULATION THAT
 HAS STILL NOT RECOVERED THE
 LEVEL OF WEALTH THEY HAD JUST
 BEFORE THE GREAT RECESSION.
 SO THEY STILL DON'T HAVE AS MUCH
 OF A CUSHION AS WHAT THEY WOULD
 LIKE TO HAVE IN A NORMAL TIME,
 LET ALONE HEADING INTO ANY
 POTENTIAL DOWNTURN.
 AND WE KNOW THAT
 STATISTICALLY, BUT IN YOUR PIECE
 YOU WROTE ABOUT THAT VERY
 SPECIFICALLY.
 IT SAYS IN DISCUSSIONS WITH 30
 AMERICANS UNABLE TO PAY ALL OF
 THEIR BILLS, A CLEAR PATTERN
 EMERGED.
 MOST WERE ABLE TO EEQ BY UNTIL
 THEY FACED AN UNEXPECTED CRISIS
 SUCH AS A JOB LOSS, CANCER, CAR
 TROUBLE OR STORM DAMAGE OR IN
 THE CASE OF THIS YEAR WE SAW
 WITH GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES WHO
 WERE FURLOUGHED OR WHEN THE
 GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN.
 THESE WERE MIDDLE-INCOME
 WORKERS.
 THESE WERE NOT POOR AMERICANS
 BUT SOME SETBACK WILL SET THEM
 OFF.
 THAT MEANS THEY ARE CONSTANTLY
 LIVING WITH A LEVEL OF ANXIETY
 WHICH WOULD CAUSE THEM TO SAY
 I'M NOT SURE WHOSE GREAT ECONOMY
 YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE
 I'M SCARED EVERY MONTH.
 YEAH.
 THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
 I THINK WHAT WE'VE REALLY
 LEARNED IN THE LAST DECADE ABOUT
 PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE WORKING
 CLASS IS HOW VOLATILE THEIR
 SITUATIONS ARE.
 THERE'S A LOT LESS CERTAINTY
 AROUND THE HOURS YOU'RE GOING TO
 WORK AND HOW MUCH YOU'RE GOING
 TO MAKE DURING THOSE HOURS.
 RETAIL WORKERS HAVE TALKED A LOT
 ABOUT HOW FRUSTRATED THEY ARE
 ABOUT NOT KNOWING THEIR SCHEDULE
 WEEK TO WEEK.
 AND, YOU KNOW, ON THE FLIP SIDE
 IS THAT PEOPLE NOT HAVING THAT
 CUSHION ANYMORE.
 THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SAVE.
 THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE AFTER
 LOSING HOMES TO GET BACK ON THAT
 HOUSING OR STOCK MARKET TO BUILD
 BACK UP THEIR SAVINGS AND THEIR
 ASSETS TO WEATHER A RAINY-DAY
 SITUATION.
 IT'S PRETTY STUNNING.
 I THINK THE KAISER FOUNDATION
 THAT GROUP THAT STUDIES HEALTH
 CARE HAD A PRETTY INCREDIBLE
 STATISTIC.
 IT'S SOMETHING LIKE ONE IN SIX
 AMERICANS EVEN IF THEY HAVE
 HEALTH INSURANCE WILL FACE AN
 UNEXPECTEDLY LARGE BILL THAT
 THEY HADN'T PLANNED FOR EVERY
 YEAR.
 HEATHER, GOOD TO TALK TO YOU.
 THANK YOU FOR THE STORY THAT
 YOU'VE WRITTEN.
 WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS
 CONVERSATION BECAUSE I THINK
 IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT ECONOMIC
 CONVERSATION OF OUR TIME.
 HEATHER LONG IS A WASHINGTON
 POST" ECONOMICS CORRESPONDENT.
 ANOTHER QUICK REMINDER IN A
 FEW MINUTES AT THE TOP OF THE
 HOUR I'M GOING TO SPEAK LIVE TO
 2020 CONTENDER SENATOR AMY
 KLOBUCHAR.
 STICK AROUND.
 YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS THAT
 CONVERSATION IN JUST A FEW
 MINUTES.
 YOU ARE WATCHING MSNBC.

 ALL RIGHT.
 LOOKS LIKE THE LONGEST ECONOMIC
 EXPANSION IN U.S. HISTORY IS
 GOING TO CONTINUE, AT LEAST FOR
 THE TIME BEING.
 THE LABOR DEPARTMENT REPORTED
 TODAY THAT HIRING REBOUNDED IN
 JUNE WITH EMPLOYERS ADDING
 224,000 NEW JOBS LAST MONTH.
 THAT'S UP FROM JUST 72,000 IN
 MAY, WHICH WAS A NOT VERY GOOD
 NUMBER.
 THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE TICKED UP
 TO 3.7%.
 THAT'S A SIGN THAT MORE PEOPLE
 ARE RETURNING TO THE WORKFORCE.
 AND AVERAGE HOURLY EARNINGS WERE
 UP JUST OVER 3% YEAR OVER YEAR.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP HAILED THE NEWS.
 WE HAD GREAT NUMBERS THIS
 MORNING.
 I THINK IT WAS 224,000 JOBS.
 THOSE WERE REALLY UNEXPECTEDLY
 GOOD.
 AND OUR COUNTRY CONTINUES TO DO
 REALLY WELL, REALLY, REALLY
 WELL.
 SO WE'RE VERY HAPPY ABOUT IT.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP MAY BE HAPPY
 ABOUT THE NEWS.
 THE MARKETS DON'T SEEM TO CARE
 AS MUCH.
 TAKING A LOOK AT THE BIG BOARD,
 WE HAVE NOW AT LEAST MOVED TO
 THE POINT WHERE WE ARE KIND OF
 FLAT.
 THE PROBLEM HERE OF COURSE IS
 THAT A STRONG JOBS NUMBER MEANS
 THAT THE FED MAY NOT LOWER
 INTEREST RATES, WHICH IS
 SOMETHING THE FED DOESN'T REALLY
 WANT TO SEEM TO DO, BUT THE
 PRESIDENT REALLY, REALLY WANTS
 THE FED TO DO, AND THAT'S WHAT'S
 TROUBLING INVESTORS.
 BUT IT'S A HOLIDAY TRADING.
 I WOULDN'T PUT TOO MUCH STOCK
 INTO ANYTHING YOU SEE.
 LET'S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THIS
 WITH MICHAEL.
 HE IS THE DIRECTOR OF ECONOMIC
 POLICY STUDIES AND A RESIDENT
 SCHOLAR AT THE AMERICAN
 ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE.
 WE WOULD CALL HIM A CONSERVATIVE
 ECONOMIST.
 MICHAEL, GOOD TO SEE YOU, MY
 FRIEND.
 THIS IS A TRICKY SITUATION FOR
 THE PRESIDENT BECAUSE HE LOVES A
 STRONG STOCK MARKET, AND HE
 LOVES LOW JOB NUMBERS, AND HE'S
 GOT BOTH AT THE MOMENT.
 BUT HE WANTS THE IF ED TO LOWER
 INTEREST RATES AND DOES
 SOMETHING LIKE THIS GIVE THE FED
 PAUSE?
 YEAH.
 I THINK IT DOES GIVE THE
 PEDESTRIAN PAUSE.
 I THINK THERE HAS GENERALLY BEEN
 A LOT OF HYPE ABOUT THE PATH OF
 INTEREST RATES AMONG
 COMMENTATORS AND ON WALL STREET
 BEFORE TODAY'S JOB NUMBERS, YOU
 KNOW, TALK OF A 50-BISCUIT OR
 SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
 I THINK THE FED, WELL, A LOT OF
 THE CONCERN ABOUT SLOWNESS OF
 THE ECONOMY WAS BASED ON WHAT WE
 SAW IN LAST MONTH'S JOB NUMBER
 WHEN IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE
 ECONOMY ADDED 75,000 JOBS.
 PEOPLE WERE CONCERNED THAT THAT
 WAS A MARKET TURNING POINT, THAT
 THE ECONOMY WAS SLOWING AND
 PERHAPS SLOWING RAPIDLY AND THAT
 THE FED NEEDED TO GET OUT AHEAD
 OF THE ECONOMY AND KIND OF
 CUSHION THE BLOW.
 YOU KNOW, TODAY WE SEE A TOTALLY
 DIFFERENT STORY.
 AND I THINK PEOPLE OVERREACTED
 TO LAST MONTH'S NEWS.
 IT'S IMPORTANT NOT TO OVERREACT
 TO THIS MONTH'S NEWS.
 WHAT I THINK WE ARE SEEING IS AN
 ECONOMY ADDING ABOUT 150 TO, YOU
 KNOW, 180,000 JOBS A MONTH,
 SLOWER THAN IN 2018.
 BUT STILL SOLID AND STILL
 STEADY.
 YOU WROTE AN OP ED FOR THE
 GUARDIAN NEWSPAPER IN WHICH YOU
 TALKED ABOUT THE ECONOMY BEING
 IN AS GOOD A SHAPE AS THE
 ECONOMY SUGGESTS.
 IT'S A STRANGE CONVERSATION TO
 HAVE ABOUT WHETHER CAPITALISM IS
 BROKEN.
 THE REMARKABLE WEALTH IN THE
 UNITED STATES AND BASICALLY
 AROUND THE WORLD IS WHAT'S
 MAKING PEOPLE SAY, HEY, I SEE
 THAT THAT STOCK MARKET GOING UP
 ALL THE TIME, I SEE HOME PRICES
 GOING UP ALL THE TIME.
 I SEE THIS STRONG ECONOMY, BUT
 MY WAGES PARTICULARLY FOR SOME,
 MAYBE IT'S ABOUT A THIRD OF
 AMERICANS THEY FEEL LEFT OUT OF
 THIS WHOLE THING, ABOUT A
 SIMILAR PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE IN
 THE UNITED KINGDOM FEEL LEFT OUT
 OF IT, PEOPLE IN FRANCE, PEOPLE
 IN GERMANY.
 THE ARAB SPRING STARTED WITH
 SOMETHING SIMILAR.
 PEOPLE SAID I'M DOING WHAT I'M
 SUPPOSED TO DO BUT I'M NOT
 RECOOPING THE FRUITS.
 IF YOU LOOK FROM, SAY, 1980
 UNTIL SAY THE GREAT RECESSION,
 YOU SEE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE
 IN INEQUALITY.
 IF YOU LOOK OVER THE LAST TEN
 YEARS INEQUALITY GROWTH HAS
 ACTUALLY FLATTENED AND IT MAY
 HAVE EVEN DECLINED DEPENDING ON
 WHICH INCOME MEASURE YOU'RE
 INTERESTED IN.
 AT THE SAME TIME AS INEQUALITY
 WAS SOARING DURING THE 1990s,
 PEOPLE WEREN'T CONCERNED ABOUT
 INEQUALITY.
 YOU KNOW, SO I THINK PEOPLE
 ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT HOW THEY ARE
 DOING.
 RIGHT, RIGHT.
 SO IN THE '90s.
 SO ONE OF THE DIFFERENCES WAS IF
 EVERYBODY'S SORT OF GOING UP AT
 A LEVEL, I DON'T KNOW IF MY
 CONTROL ROOM HAS THE SAME
 NUMBERS THAT I PUT UP WITH
 HEATHER LONG SINCE THE '80s AND
 THE '90s.
 WHEN YOU'VE GOT RELATIVE
 FLATNESS AND EVEN DECLINE
 AMONGST THE BOTTOM 50% THAT,
 DOESN'T FEEL LIKE YOU'RE DOING
 BETTER.
 YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
 AND WHEN WE HAD THIS MASSIVE
 FINANCIAL CRISIS, THIS SERIOUS
 RECESSION, AND THEN WE HAD A
 RECOVERY THAT WAS SLOW.
 THAT'S TYPICAL FOLLOWING
 RECESSIONS AS SEVERE AS THIS
 ONE.
 BUT FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND
 YEARS, WE HAD SLOW AND
 NONACCELERATING WAGE GROWTH.
 AND OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS,
 THAT'S CHANGED THANK GOODNESS.
 AND MY SENSE IS THAT IF WE HAVE
 A LONG ENOUGH PERIOD WHERE WAGES
 FOR TYPICAL WORKERS ARE GROWING
 AT A DECENT CLIP, THAT SOME OF
 THIS CONCERN THAT WE'RE SEEING
 WILL DIE DOWN.
 I HEAR YOUR ARGUMENT.
 ARE YOU WORRIED THAT GIVEN HOW
 LONG WE'RE INTO THIS EXPANSION
 THAT JUST BY NATURAL CAUSES IT
 WILL SLOW DOWN AND WE WON'T GET
 THAT CONTINUED WAGE GROWTH?
 BECAUSE IT'S ONLY REALLY SINCE
 ABOUT 2015 THAT WE'VE SEEN A
 NICE BUMP.
 WE'VE SEEN SOME OF THAT EXTRA
 CAPACITY IN THE LABOR MARKET GO
 AWAY, AND PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY
 GETTING RAISES.
 YEAH.
 I AM WORRIED ABOUT THAT.
 AND THAT ACTUALLY TIES IN NICELY
 WITH WHAT WE LEARNED THIS
 MORNING.
 YOU KNOW, AGAIN, A SOLID MONTH,
 BUT IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT 2019 IS
 GOING TO BE A SLOWER YEAR FOR
 THE LABOR MARKET THAN 2018.
 YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE REASONS IS
 BECAUSE WE'RE JUST RUNNING OUT
 OF WORKERS TO BRING IN OFF THE
 SIDELINES.
 WE SAW THE LABOR FORCE
 PARTICIPATION RATE TICK UP THIS
 MONTH.
 THAT'S FANTASTIC.
 BUT THERE'S REALLY ONLY SO HIGH
 THAT CAN GO.
 THERE ARE ONLY SO MANY WORKERS
 WE CAN BRING BACK IN.
 AND AT SOME POINT WE ARE GOING
 TO HAVE ANOTHER RECESSION.
 AND SO I THINK YOUR QUESTION IS
 A GOOD ONE.
 HOW LONG CAN WE KEEP SOLID WAGE
 GAINS GOING, AND IF THE ANSWER
 IS NOT THAT MUCH LONGER, THEN
 WHAT DOES THAT DO TO KIND OF
 POLITICS AND WHAT DOES THAT DO
 TO POPULAR SENTIMENT?
 I THINK THAT'S A RATHER
 IMPORTANT QUESTION WE ARE
 FACING.
 MICHAEL, I ALWAYS ENJOY
 TALKING TO YOU.
 THANK YOU FOR MAKING TIME FOR US
 TODAY.
 AND ONCE AGAIN REMAINS
 UNCLEAR IF THE 2020 CENSUS WILL
 INCLUDE A CITIZENSHIP QUESTION.
 JUST LAST HOUR, JUSTICE
 DEPARTMENT LAWYERS TOLD A
 FEDERAL COURT IN MARYLAND THAT
 THEY WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR
 WAYS TO GET THE QUESTION ON THE
 CENSUS DESPITE AN UNFAVORABLE
 RULING FROM THE SUPREME COURT.
 AND THE PRESIDENT REAFFIRMED HIS
 COMMITMENT TO INCLUDING THE
 QUESTION ON THE CENSUS EARLIER
 TODAY MAYBE BY USING AN
 EXECUTIVE ORDER.
 I JUST SPOKE WITH THE
 ATTORNEY GENERAL.
 WE HAVE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT
 AVENUES.
 WE COULD USE ALL OF THEM OR ONE.
 WE ARE DOING VERY WELL ON THAT
 ISSUE.
 WE ARE SPENDING 15 TO
 $20 BILLION ON A CENSUS.
 WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING.
 WE ARE FINDING OUT EVERYTHING
 ABOUT EVERYBODY.
 THINK OF IT.
 15 TO $20 BILLION AND YOU'RE NOT
 ALLOWED TO ASK THEM ARE YOU A
 CITIZEN.
 AND BY THE WAY IF YOU LOOK AT
 THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, IT'S
 ALMOST ALWAYS BEEN ASKED.
 SO WE ARE FIGHTING VERY HARD
 AGAINST THE SYSTEM THAT'S A VERY
 DIFFICULT SYSTEM, BUT WE'LL MAKE
 A DECISION.
 JOINING ME NOW IS NBC NEWS
 JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT PETE
 WILLIAMS.
 THAT WAS A MOMENT OF
 SELF-AWARENESS FOR THE
 PRESIDENT.
 HE SAID WE ARE FIGHTING IN A
 SYSTEM AND IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT
 SYSTEM.
 IT IS COMPLEX AND IT IS
 DIFFICULT.
 THE PRESIDENT CAN'T ACTUALLY
 JUST SAY PUT THE QUESTION ON
 NOW.
 WELL, HE CAN, BUT WHETHER
 THAT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE
 REMAINS TO BE SEEN.
 I THINK AT THIS POINT ANYTHING
 THE ADMINISTRATION DOES FROM
 HERE ON IS GOING TO INVITE
 LITIGATION AND THE JUSTICE
 DEPARTMENT ADMITTED AS SUCH OR
 CONCEDED THE POINT TODAY IN ITS
 FILING WHAT THIS IS IN MARYLAND,
 THIS IS A SEPARATE CASE, THIS IS
 NOT THE ONE THAT WENT TO THE
 SUPREME COURT.
 IT'S ONE THAT IS STILL GOING ON
 IN WHICH CHALLENGERS SAY ADDING
 THIS QUESTION WOULD BE UNFAIR
 DISCRIMINATION VIOLATING LEGAL
 PROTECTION CLAUSE OF THE
 CONSTITUTION.
 AND WHAT THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IN
 THE FILING BEFORE THAT JUDGE IS
 THAT THEY'VE BEEN ASKED TO
 RE-EVALUATE ALL AVAILABLE
 OPTIONS THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR
 PUTTING THIS QUESTION BACK ON
 THE CENSUS FORM.
 NO GREAT SURPRISE THERE GIVEN
 WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAD SAID THIS
 MORNING.
 BUT THEY DO SAY THAT IF, FOR
 EXAMPLE, COMMERCE SECRETARY ROSS
 COMES UP WITH A NEW EXPLANATION
 FOR WANTING TO PUT THIS QUESTION
 ON THE FORM, THEN THE
 PLAINTIFFS, THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE
 CHALLENGED THAT, WILL BE FULLY
 ENTITLED TO CHALLENGE THE
 DECISION AT THAT TIME.
 SO THEY CAN SEE THAT ALMOST
 ANYTHING THEY DO AT THIS POINT
 WILL BE PRODUCING A NEW LAWSUIT.
 AND OF COURSE THE ISSUE THERE IS
 IT PUTS ADDITIONAL PRESSURE ON
 THE CENSUS BUREAU THE LONGER
 THESE LAWSUITS PLAY OUT IN
 COURT, THE LESS TIME THE CENSUS
 BUREAU HAS TO GET THESE FORMS
 PRINTED.
 THIS LETTER DOES SAY DESPITE ALL
 OF THIS BACK AND FORTH, NO
 CENSUS FORMS ARE BEING PRINTED
 NOW THAT HAVE THE CITIZENSHIP
 QUESTION ON THEM.
 THEY SAY THEY ARE CURRENTLY
 ENJOINED BY ALL THESE COURT
 RULINGS FROM PUTTING THE
 QUESTIONNAIRE -PUTTING THE
 CENSUS QUESTIONNAIRE, PRINTING
 RATHER A CENSUS QUESTIONNAIRE
 THAT INCLUDES THIS CITIZENSHIP
 QUESTION.
 SO THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO FIND
 SOME WAY TO DO IT, BUT JUST
 ABOUT ANYTHING THEY TRY TO DO IS
 UNDOUBTEDLY GOING TO PRODUCE
 ANOTHER LAWSUIT, MORE
 LITIGATION, AND MORE DELAY.
 FOR TIME AND LOGISTICS
 PURPOSES, UNDER WHAT CONSTRAINTS
 IS THE CENSUS BUREAU OPERATING?
 IN OTHER WORDS THE PRESIDENT
 TALKED ABOUT DELAYING THE
 CENSUS.
 IS THAT ANOTHER COURT CASE OR
 CAN THE PRESIDENT ACTUALLY DO
 THAT?
 AH.
 WELL, TWO THINGS.
 WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT DLACHLG THE
 CENSUS, MY SENSE IS THAT HE
 DIDN'T REALLY MEAN PUTTING OFF
 WHEN THE DOORS GET KNOCKED ON
 AND WHEN PEOPLE FILL OUT THE
 FORM.
 TRADITIONALLY THE CENSUS HAS
 BEEN A SNAPSHOT OF WHO'S WHERE
 ON APRIL 1st OF EVERY, YOU KNOW,
 EVERY YEAR THAT ENDS IN A ZERO.
 AND I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT THAT
 WILL BE DELAYED.
 WHAT I THINK -WHAT I SUSPECT
 HE WAS TALKING ABOUT IS GETTING
 THE FORMS PRINTED.
 BUT THE GOVERNMENT HAS SAID WE
 HAVE TO START PRINTING THESE
 THINGS JULY 1st.
 AND INDEED THEY DID TO GET THEM
 ALL DONE IN TIME.
 IT RAISES A QUESTION THOUGH.
 IF THEY HAVE TO START OVER, IF
 THEY SOMEHOW PREVAIL AND ARE
 ABLE TO ADD THIS QUESTION, COULD
 THEY TRASH ALL THE STUFF THEY
 HAVE PRINTED SO FAR AND START
 OVER?
 WOULD THEY HAVE ENOUGH TIME?
 AND I GUESS THE ANSWER IS IF
 THEY HAD ENOUGH MONEY, YES,
 THEY'D JUST GET MORE PRINTERS
 INVOLVED AND COULD PROBABLY GET
 IT DONE.
 I'M JUST NOT SURE WHERE THAT
 MONEY COMES FROM, WHETHER THEY'D
 HAVE TO GO BACK TO CONGRESS, AND
 THAT WOULD ADD ANOTHER BIT OF
 DELAY.
 PETE WILLIAMS, NEVER BEEN
 STUMPED BY A COMPLICATED
 QUESTION.
 I PRETEND NOT TO BE.
 WITH ME NOW WASHINGTON POST"
 OPINION WRITER JENNIFER REUBEN.
 AND SHE'S A CONSERVATIVE AND SHE
 WRITES IN A NEW HEADLINE CENSUS,
 A FLAT-OUT WIN FOR PROGRESSIVES,
 THE COURTS, AND AMERICA.
 TELL ME ABOUT THAT, JENNIFER.
 WHY DO YOU ADD PROGRESSIVES IN
 THAT TITLE?
 WHY DO YOU THINK IT'S A WIN FOR
 PROGRESSIVES?
 I THINK IT'S A WIN FOR
 EVERYONE.
 I THINK THE PROGRESSIVE GROUPS
 THAT WERE LITIGANTING, GROUPS
 LIKE THE ACLU WERE MAKING THE
 VERY COGENT ARGUMENT THAT THE
 PRESIDENT WAS INCLUDING THIS
 QUESTION AS A WAY OF DETERRING
 PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE AFRAID TO
 GIVE OUT THEIR INFORMATION OR
 THE INFORMATION OF PEOPLE LIVING
 WITH THEM REGARDING THEIR
 IMMIGRANT STATUS.
 AND THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY
 CONTRARY TO LAW.
 IT'S BEEN DECIDED A WHILE BACK
 THAT THE CENSUS IS SUPPOSED TO
 BE CATCHING EVERYBODY.
 AND BY INCLUDING THIS QUESTION,
 YOU'RE PURPOSEFULLY DIMINISHING
 THE COUNT IN AREAS THAT THERE
 PROBABLY ARE GOING TO BE SOME
 BLUE REPRESENTATIVES, URBAN
 AREAS, FOR EXAMPLE.
 SO, I THINK FOR THEM THIS WAS A
 LEGAL VICTORY AT THE SUPREME
 COURT.
 AND NOW THE PRESIDENT IS KIND OF
 PLAYING WITH WORDS AND THE POOR
 JUSTICE DEPARTMENT LAWYERS HAVE
 HAVING TO GO INTO PORT TO MAKE
 THEMSELVES LOOK AWFULLY FOOLISH.
 UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'VE SAID.
 THEY HAVE SAID, WELL, WE DON'T
 HAVE THE REAL REASON, WE DON'T
 HAVE THE REAL NONPROTECTURAL
 REASON YET.
 BUT GIVE US A FEW REASONS AND WE
 WILL COME UP WITH A REASON.
 THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY JUST LOOKING
 FOR ANOTHER LIE.
 AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, THE
 MARILYN CASE IS THE CASE IN
 WHICH SOME NEW EVIDENCE HAS COME
 TO LIGHT.
 THIS IS DAMNING TO THE
 ADMINISTRATION.
 APPARENTLY A COMPUTER FILE WAS
 FOUND IN ORDER TO BENEFIT THE
 REPUBLICAN PARTY BY
 OVERCOUNTERING OR, IF YOU WILL,
 TIPPING THE SCALES TOWARDS THE
 WHITE POPULATION.
 THIS IS COMPLETELY ILLEGAL.
 THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE
 PLAINTIFFS HAVE BEEN FEARING.
 AND IF THEY WANT TO GO FORWARD,
 THE PLAINTIFFS ARE SAYING, WELL,
 YES, LET'S GO FORWARD, LET'S
 COVER ALL OF THIS NEW
 INFORMATION.
 THE GOVERNMENT FILING TODAY
 UNBELIEVABLY SAID GIVE US SOME
 MORE TIME TO THINK OF A REASON,
 BUT DON'T LET THEM LOOK AT THE
 DISCOVERY.
 WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CONCEPT
 OF A CENSUS, IT'S IN THE OLD
 TESTAMENT, RIGHT?
 RIGHT.
 IT HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY
 STOOD THAT IF YOU DON'T COUNT
 PROPERLY, YOU MESS UP ON THE
 PROVISIONS.
 SHOULD THIS EVEN BE PARTISAN?
 SHOULDN'T WE JUST ALL AGREE, AND
 SOMETIMES IT'S GOING TO BENEFIT
 CONSERVATIVES AND SOMETIMES IT'S
 GOING TO BENEFIT PROGRESSIVES,
 BUT SHOULDN'T WE JUST ALL BE
 COUNTING PROPERLY AND NOT BE
 DEBATING THIS?
 WE SHOULD, BUT UNFORTUNATELY
 THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE IT
 PARTISAN.
 HE IS DETERMINED NOT TO COUNT
 EVERYBODY OR TO SET UP A
 QUESTION THAT IS DESIGNED TO
 MAKE A COUNT REALLY INACCURATE.
 HE'S THE ONLY PRESIDENT THAT HAS
 DONE THIS.
 HE'S THE ONLY PRESIDENT WHO HAS
 TAKEN OBJECTIVELY NEUTRAL THINGS
 THAT SHOULD BE A MATTER OF
 NONPARTISAN BEFORE THE FOURTH OF
 JULY.
 JUB OBJECTIVELY NEUTRAL.
 IT SHOULD BE BUT NOT UNDER
 THIS PRESIDENT.
 HE WAS THE ONE WHO CAME UP WITH
 THE IDEA, THE SECRETARY OF
 COMMERCE WAS THE ONE WHO CAME UP
 WITH A FALSE REASON, THE CHIEF
 JUSTICE WAS VERY NICE NOT
 CALLING HIM A LIAR, BUT HE
 ESSENTIALLY SAID THE REASON
 DOESN'T MATCH THE FACTS.
 THAT'S LYING IN MY BOOK.
 BUT HE SENT THEM BACK TO FIGURE
 THIS WHOLE THING OUT I THINK
 HOPING THAT IT WOULDN'T COME
 BACK.
 I SUSPECT IF IT EVER COMES BACK
 TO THE SUPREME COURT, THE
 SUPREME COURT WILL HAVE USED UP
 THEIR PATIENCE ON THIS, AND WILL
 SWAT IT AWAY AGAIN.
 WHAT A REMARKABLE -I MEAN,
 OF ALL THE THINGS I DIDN'T THINK
 I'D ACTUALLY DISCUSSING AS A
 JOURNALIST, THIS IS JUST ONE
 MORE TO PILE ON TO THE TOP.
 THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
 UP NEXT, YOU HEAR IT A LOT
 FROM THE 2020 DEMOCRATIC
 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES.
 THEY WANT TO INVEST IN
 EDUCATION.
 MOST OF THEM DON'T HAVE A VERY
 DETAILED PLAN ON HOW THEY'D DO,
 BUT SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR JUST
 UNVEILED HERS.
 I AM GOING TO TALK TO HER ABOUT
 IT IN JUST A COUPLE MINUTES.
 LATER THE PRESIDENT SAID HE
 WOULD START A BIG DEPORTATION
 PUSH AFTER THE FOURTH OF JULY.
 I WILL TALK TO THE FORMER I.C.E.
 CHIEF ABOUT WHAT GOES INTO
 IMMIGRATION RAIDS NEXT.

 THE PARADES, PICNICS AND OTHER FOURTH OF JULY EVENTS ARE
 OVER AND THE PRESIDENTIAL
 CANDIDATES HAVE RETURNED TO
 SERIOUS POLICY DISCUSSIONS.
 TODAY A NUMBER OF THEM ARE
 TALKING ABOUT EDUCATION.
 TEN DEMOCRATIC CONTENDERS ARE
 TAKING PART IN THE NATIONAL
 EDUCATION ASSOCIATION'S STRONG
 PUBLIC SCHOOLS PRESIDENTIAL
 FORUM TAKING PLACE RIGHT NOW IN
 HOUSTON.
 BERNIE SANDERS, YOU CAN SEE, UP
 THERE ON THE STAGE.
 ONE OF THE CANDIDATES
 PARTICIPATING IN TODAY'S EVENT
 IS MINNESOTA SENATOR AMY
 KLOBUCHAR WHOSE MOTHER WAS A
 SECOND GRADE TEACHER.
 A SHORT TIME AGO SHE UNVEILED A
 NEW PROPOSAL CALLED PROGRESS
 PARTNERSHIPS, A FEDERAL STATE
 EFFORT TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL
 RESOURCES AND FUNDING FOR PUBLIC
 SCHOOLS.
 IN ORDER TO TAKE PART, STATES
 WILL NEED TO DO OR HAVE ALREADY
 DONE THE FOLLOWING THINGS.
 WITH REGARD TO TEACHER PAY,
 STATES WILL AGREE TO A STATE
 FEDERAL PARTNERSHIP THAT
 INCLUDES GENEROUS FEDERAL
 MATCHES TO INCREASE SALARIES FOR
 ALL TEACHERS.
 STATES WILL ALSO HAVE TO WORK
 WITH EDUCATORS TO DEVELOP AND
 SUBMIT RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW
 SCHOOLS CAN MEET THE NEEDS OF
 WORKING FAMILIES LIKE
 AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAMS,
 ALTERNATIVE PROGRAMS, AND
 COMMUNITY SCHOOLS.
 THE PLAN ALSO CALLS FOR GENEROUS
 FEDERAL FUNDING TO IMPROVE
 SCHOOL INFRASTRUCTURE.
 STATES WILL ALSO HAVE TO CREATE
 A MECHANISM FOR DISTRIBUTING
 THOSE FUNDS THAT MAKE SURE TO
 ADDRESS DISPARITIES IN
 CONDITIONS AND RESOURCES AND
 PROVIDE EQUAL FUNDING FOR
 DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE.
 AND STATES WILL ALSO NEED TO
 CONVENE A COMMISSION TO REVIEW
 THEIR EXISTING EDUCATION FUNDING
 FORMULA TO ENSURE THAT ALL
 STUDENTS, PARTICULARLY THOSE
 WITH THE GREATEST NEEDS, HAVE
 ACCESS TO ADEQUATE EDUCATIONAL
 RESOURCES.
 SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR JOINS ME
 NOW FROM THE NEA CONFERENCE IN
 HOUSTON.
 SHE IS A CONTENDER FOR THE
 PRESIDENCY IN 020.
 SENATOR, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
 THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.
 WELL, THANKS, ALI.
 THANKS FOR MENTIONING MY MOM.
 SHE WOULD HAVE LOVED TO BE HERE
 TODAY.
 SHE TAUGHT SECOND GRADE UNTIL
 SHE WAS 70 YEARS OLD.
 WOW.
 AND I STILL HAVE PEOPLE COME
 UP TO ME AND SAY SHE WAS THEIR
 FAVORITE TEACHER.
 HER FAVORITE UNIT SHE TAUGHT WAS
 THE MONARCH BUTTERFLY ONE WHERE
 SHE WOULD DRESS UP WITH
 ANTENNAS, TIGHTS, AND CARRY A
 SIGN THAT SAID "TO MEXICO OR
 BUST" BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE
 MONARCH BUTTERFLIES FLEW.
 THERE SHE IS.
 SHE WAS A TEACHER OF THE YEAR
 FOR HER DISTRICT A NUMBER OF
 TIMES.
 ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SHE HAD
 THOUGHT VERY STRONGLY ABOUT WAS
 THAT ALL KIDS, WHICH I HAVE NOW
 INHERITED, ALL KIDS DESERVE A
 RIGHT TO A GOOD EDUCATION.
 AND THAT'S WHY I WENT TO PUBLIC
 SCHOOL.
 MY DAUGHTER WENT TO PUBLIC
 SCHOOLS INCLUDING A NUMBER OF
 YEARS IN A SCHOOL THAT WAS
 NEARLY 90% FREE AND REDUCED
 LUNCH.
 SO I HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT'S
 GOING ON THERE.
 AND I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW
 THERE SHOULD BE MORE FEDERAL
 INVESTMENT AND MORE FOCUS ON
 EDUCATION.
 IF WE WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN
 THIS GLOBAL ECONOMY, OUR KIDS
 HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO A GOOD
 JOB.
 TO DO A GOOD JOB YOU NEED
 TEACHERS.
 AND TO RECRUIT GOOD TEACHERS,
 YOU NEED TO HAVE GOOD PAY, AND
 YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE
 KIDS ARE GETTING PREPARED FOR
 THE JOBS WE HAVE AVAILABLE
 TODAY.
 SO WE HAVE 330 MILLION PEOPLE
 IN THE UNITED STATES ROUGHLY.
 WE HAVE 50 MILLION PUBLIC SCHOOL
 STUDENTS IN 2017.
 AND FUNDAMENTALLY THE
 RESPONSIBILITY FOR EDUCATING
 THOSE STUDENTS FALLS TO THE
 STATES.
 SO WHILE I AM DEEPLY
 APPRECIATIVE OF THE THOUGHT THAT
 GOES INTO PLANS LIKE YOURS AND
 THE OTHER CANDIDATES, STATES IN
 GENERAL HAVE BEEN UNDERFUNDING
 VERY DELIBERATELY UNDERFUNDING
 PUBLIC EDUCATION FOR DECADES
 NOW.
 WE HAVE CREATED A WORLD IN WHICH
 PEOPLE LIKE YOUR MOTHER ARE NOT
 TREATED THE WAY THEY SHOULD BE
 IN TERMS OF THE RESPECT AND THE
 PAY THEY SHOULD BE GIVEN.
 NOW PUBLIC SCHOOLTEACHERS WHO
 MAY EARN WHATEVER THEY EARN ARE
 OFTEN TAKING MONEY OUT OF THEIR
 OWN POCKETS TO BUY SUPPLIES FOR
 THEIR OWN SCHOOLS.
 HOW DO YOU SHIFT THAT
 CONVERSATION.
 MY MOM DID THAT.
 SO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS
 SPENDING LIKE 3% OF EDUCATION
 COSTS.
 YOU SHOULD MOVE THAT UP.
 LET ME TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT YOU
 SAID IS WHY I PUT THESE PROGRESS
 PARTNERSHIPS FORWARD.
 I THINK YOU NEED TO INCENTIVIZE
 THE STATES TO DO MORE,
 ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO
 TEACHER PAY INFRASTRUCTURE,
 THOSE THINGS.
 YOU DO IT WITH GENEROUS MATCHING
 GRANTS AND TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE
 HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.
 THE SECOND THING, AND THIS IS A
 PLAN A NUMBER OF US HAVE PUT
 FORWARD, KAMALA HARRIS AND
 OTHERS, ABOUT INCREASING TEACHER
 PAY.
 AND ONE OF THE WAYS YOU CAN DO
 THIS IS BY PAYING FOR IT WITH
 GOING BACK TO THE NUMBERS AND
 THE ESTATE TAX THAT WE HAD
 DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
 OR SOMEWHERE AROUND THAT.
 AND THAT WOULD LITERALLY RAISE
 ENOUGH MONEY TO SUBSTANTIALLY
 INCREASE TEACHER PAY OR TALKING
 HERE ABOUT THAT AS STATE TAX
 EXEMPTION.
 THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT
 WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL TO
 RECRUITING.
 AND THAT'S FEDERAL MONEY.
 THEN YOU ADD IDEAS LIKE MINE
 WHICH IS TO INCENTIVIZE STATES
 TO BE FOCUSING MORE ON TEACHERS
 AND OUR SCHOOLS AND MAKING SURE
 THAT WE HAVE MORE QUALITY IN OUR
 SCHOOLS.
 THAT'S THE WAY YOU DO IT.
 SO WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT
 ISSUES THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH.
 ONE IS TEACHER PAY.
 I JUST WANT TO SHOW OUR VIEWERS
 ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL
 EDUCATION ASSOCIATION HOSTING
 THE EVENT YOU'RE AT, THE HIGHEST
 TEACHER SALARIES ARE IN NEW
 YORK, CALIFORNIA, AND
 MASSACHUSETTS, UPWARD OF $80,000
 A YEAR.
 THE LOWEST IN MISSISSIPPI, WEST
 VIRGINIA, AND OKLAHOMA IN THE
 40s.
 SO WE'VE GOT THAT PROBLEM THAT
 YOU AND I DISCUSSED.
 AND THEN WE'VE GOT THIS OTHER
 ISSUE, AND THAT IS STATES WITH
 THE HIGHEST AND LOWEST AVERAGE
 SPENDING PER CAPITA ON STUDENT.
 AGAIN, NEW YORK, WASHINGTON
 STATE, AND NEW JERSEY SPEND
 UPWARD OF $20,000 PER PUPIL.
 IDAHO, UTAH, AND ARIZONA ARE
 SPENDING 6, 7, AND $8,000 PER
 PUPIL.
 WE ARE NOWHERE CLOSE TO HAVING A
 STANDARDIZED LEVEL OF EDUCATION
 IF YOU LOOK AT IT THROUGH
 FUNDING IN THIS COUNTRY.
 RIGHT.
 THAT IS WHY UPPING THE FEDERAL
 ROLE, PUTTING IN AN EDUCATION
 SECRETARY WHO IS NOT BETSY
 DeVOS, MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE
 POLICYMAKERS IN PLACE THAT
 UNDERSTAND WHAT EDUCATION MEANS
 AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR
 INDIVIDUAL FAMILIES BUT ALSO FOR
 THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY WHEN
 WE'RE TRYING TO COMPETE IN A
 GLOBAL ECONOMY.
 AND THEN I THINK ONE REALLY
 INTERESTING ISSUE WAS
 APPRENTICESHIPS AND DOING MORE
 WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGES AT THE
 HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL.
 SO THAT'S A LOT ABOUT WHAT WE
 ARE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT
 TODAY.
 I CAN TELL YOU SCHOOL, COLLEGE,
 THOSE ARE THINGS THAT PEOPLE
 BROUGHT INTO THE PARADES.
 I'VE BECOME THE ONLY CANDIDATE
 THAT WENT THE LAST THREE DAYS
 HAVE BEEN IN IOWA, NEW
 HAMPSHIRE, AND HOUSTON.
 PEOPLE BRING UP SCHOOL A LOT.
 THAT IS CORE TO THEIR FAMILIES.
 AS SOMEONE THAT DIDN'T COME FROM
 MONEY THAT STANDS HERE TODAY AS
 A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT AFTER
 BEING THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF AN
 IRON ORE MINER WHO COULDN'T
 FINISH HIGH SCHOOL AND THE
 DAUGHTER OF A TEACHER AND A
 NEWSPAPER MAN, I CAN WALK THE
 WALK WHEN IT COMES TO THE
 IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION.
 AND THAT'S WHAT I AM GOING TO BE
 TALKING ABOUT TODAY ON THAT
 STAGE.
 SENATOR, ONE OF THE OTHER
 TOPICS THAT WE COVER VERY
 CLOSELY ON THIS SHOW IS THE
 ISSUE OF DATA PRIVACY AND
 MANAGEMENT WITH FACEBOOK.
 ROGER McNAMEE TALKS VERY FONDLY
 OF THE FACT THAT YOU -YOU
 DON'T GET A LOT OF PRESS FOR
 THIS, BUT YOU PUT A LOT OF
 THINKING INTO HOW TO DEAL WITH
 SILICON VALLEY AND TECH.
 GIVE US A BIT OF YOUR IDEA ABOUT
 HOW YOU DEAL WITH THE VERY
 PRESSING AND ALMOST DAILY
 CONCERNS THAT WE ARE HEARING
 ABOUT HOW THESE COMPANIES
 OPERATE AND MANAGE OUR
 INFORMATION.
 I THINK THEY THOUGHT THEY
 COULD JUST RUN THE TABLES AND NO
 ONE WOULD CARE BECAUSE THEY'RE
 SUCCESSFUL COMPANIES.
 I DON'T LIKE TO TAKE SUCCESS
 AWAY FROM THEM, THAT'S GREAT.
 BUT THE POINT IS WE NEED A
 COUNTERBALANCE HERE.
 AND THE FIRST THING WE NEED IS
 PRIVACY RULES IN PLACE.
 AND THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO SAY,
 NO, WE ARE JUST A FORUM.
 NO THEY'RE NOT.
 THEY ARE MEDIA COMPANIES.
 THEY HAVE MADE TONS OF MONEY OFF
 INDIVIDUALS.
 ONE OF THE FEW BIPARTISAN BILLS
 OUT THERE TO DO IT WITH MAKING
 SURE THAT THERE ARE RULES IN
 PLACE SO PEOPLE CAN PROTECT
 THEIR PRIVATE DATA IS FIRST.
 YOU ALSO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT
 WHEN THEY'RE SHARING DATA THAT
 THERE'S RULES ABOUT THAT.
 AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THEY
 HAVE TO PAY A FEE, A TAX, SO
 THAT MONEY CAN GO BACK INTO OUR
 NATION'S CYBERSECURITY TO
 PROTECT US.
 AND THE THIRD THING IS ALL ABOUT
 DEMOCRACY.
 IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING ABOUT
 THIS BEFORE THE NEXT ELECTION,
 WHEN WE HAVE A PRESIDENT SENDING
 OUT DOCTORED VIDEOS OF SPEAKER
 PELOSI, SHE'S STRONG, SHE IS
 GOING TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT
 HERSELF.
 BUT IF THIS IS WHAT OUR
 CAMPAIGNS ARE GOING TO COME TO,
 VIDEOS WHERE YOU CAN'T EVEN TELL
 IF IT'S THE PERSON OR NOT, WE
 HAVE A MAJOR PROBLEM.
 SO MAKING THOSE COMPANIES PUT
 SOME RULES OF THE ROAD IN PLACE
 WHEN IT COMES TO WHO'S BUYING
 ADS, WHO IS PAYING FOR THOSE
 ADS, WHAT THOSE ADS ARE SO OTHER
 CAMPAIGNS AND THE MEDIA CAN SEE
 THEM IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL.
 WHY SHOULD YOUR NETWORK HAVE TO
 FOLLOW THOSE RULES, AND THEN
 THESE OTHER BILLION DOLLAR
 COMPANIES DON'T?
 IT MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL.
 AND AS WE KNOW FROM 2016, IT
 PAYS A MAJOR ROLE IN SPREADING
 FAKE NEWS AND ALSO ALLOWING
 BASICALLY FOR FOREIGN COUNTRIES
 TO HAVE INFLUENCE ON OUR
 ELECTION.
 AND WHEN I HEARD THE PRESIDENT
 MAKE A JOKE ABOUT MEDDLING WHEN
 HE WAS AT THE G20, THAT'S JUST
 WHAT WE ARE DEALING WITH RIGHT
 NOW.
 WE ARE IN JULY 4th WEEK, WE KNOW
 THAT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
 SACRIFICED SERVING OUR COUNTRY
 HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF THEM
 DYING, SERVING OUR COUNTRY.
 THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED.
 AND YET HE MAKES A JOKE ABOUT
 IT.
 IT'S NOT A JOKE NOT TO THOSE WHO
 HAVE SERVED TO PROTECT OUR
 FREEDOM.
 I WANT TO ASK YOU ONE LAST
 QUESTION.
 YOU ARE FROM MINNESOTA AND YOU
 ARE ON THE AGRICULTURE
 COMMITTEE.
 JUST IN THE LAST HOUR I SPEAK TO
 A CONSERVATIVE ECONOMIST WHO
 SAID THAT WHILE FARMERS ARE
 SUFFERING BECAUSE OF THE TRADE
 WAR, THE AMOUNT OF SUBSIDY THEY
 GET FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
 ALLOWS THEM TO JUSTIFY
 CONTINUING TO SUPPORT THE
 PRESIDENT IN THESE TRADE WARS.
 WHAT'S YOUR TAKE ON THAT?
 MY TAKE IS THAT THE FARMERS I
 KNOW, THEY JUST WANT TO MAKE A
 LIVING.
 THEY KNOW VERY WELL IS THE MORE
 THEIR SOY BEANS SIT AT THEIR
 FARMS OR THEY ARE UNABLE TO SELL
 GOODS TO MARKET, THE MORE THOSE
 CONTRACTS ARE GOING TO FARMERS
 IN OTHER COUNTRIES AND FOREIGN
 LANDS.
 IT'S GOING TO BE HARDER AND
 HARDER.
 THEY CAN'T JUST GET THOSE
 CONTRACTS BACK IN A MONTH.
 SO THEY'RE LONG-TERM VIABILITY.
 WE HAVE HAD MORE AND MORE FARM
 BANKRUPTCIES, ESPECIALLY FOR THE
 SMALL FARMERS.
 SO MY FOCUS AS A SENIOR MEMBER
 OF THE AGRICULTURE COMMITTEE AND
 MY FOCUS AS PRESIDENT WILL BE TO
 MAKE SURE THAT WE KEEP OUR FOOD
 SUPPLY IN AMERICA.
 WE DO THAT WITH A SPECIAL FOCUS
 ON OUR SMALL FARMERS.
 I HAVE A VERY STRONG TRACK
 RECORD OF MAKING SURE THESE
 PAYMENTS AREN'T GOING TO THE
 BEVERLY HILLS 90210 AREA CODE
 THAT THEY ARE GOING INSTEAD TO
 OUR SMALL FARMERS.
 AND THEN MAKING SURE THAT IF
 WE'RE GOING TO PUSH ON TRADE
 WHICH WE SHOULD DO THAT WE'RE
 NOT USING A MEAT CLEAVER LIKE
 THIS PRESIDENT HAS DONE OR WE
 CAN CALL IT A TWEET CLEAVER.
 BUT INSTEAD THAT WE ARE FOCUSED
 ON TARGETED TARIFFS AND TARGETED
 TRADE POLICIES THAT ARE REALLY
 GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
 THAT'S WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT
 THAT'S GOING ON IN THE MIDWEST.
 I AM SOMEONE THAT'S WON IN THOSE
 RED DISTRICTS.
 I HAVE WON IN 42 OF THE COUNTIES
 THAT TRUMP WON IN MY STATE.
 I THINK THE FARMERS WANT TO MAKE
 A DECENT LIVING AND THEY WANT
 SOMEONE WHO CAN LOOK THEM IN THE
 EYE AND TELL THEM THE TRUTH.
 THEY DON'T ALWAYS AGREE WITH,
 BUT TELL THEM THE TRUTH.
 THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THIS
 PRESIDENT REALLY DOES.
 SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR, THANK
 YOU FOR TAKING TIME TO TALK TO
 US TODAY.
 IT WAS GREAT TO BE ON.
 AMY KLOBUCHAR, CANDIDATE FOR
 PRESIDENT, AND SHE IS A SENATOR
 FROM MINNESOTA.
 STILL AHEAD, THE PRESIDENT
 PROMISED TO CRACK DOWN ON
 ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AFTER THE
 FOURTH OF JULY.
 THE HOLIDAY HAS COME AND GONE,
 AND PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS THE
 RAIDS WILL START SOON.
                       WILL STAR.

 Budget meeting!                           Sweet.
   If you compare last quarter        to this quarter...          Various: Mmm.

 Going to the Shawn Mendes Verizon UP concert
 was like an out of body experience.
   We were right in front of him. Dead center. Front row.
 'Cause actually, Zarmina, you touched Shawn Mendes.
             Yeah, I touched him! She touched Shawn Mendes!
             He like held my hand             for a while.
               And then we got               to meet him after,               which was like...
 Another surprise.                            Yeah.
   We love Verizon even more now.
                I'll never forget                that day. Ever.
 The network more people rely on,         gives you more.
    Like thousands of tickets           to concerts,
   festivals and private shows.
        And big savings on our best phones when you switch.
         That's Verizon.

       (KICKSTART MY HEART         BY MOTLEY CRUE)



      (sound of can hitting          bag and bowl)
         I'M ALEX TREBEK,         HERE TO TELL YOU
 ABOUT THE COLONIAL PENN PROGRAM.   <i> Always there in crunch time.</i>
     IF YOU'RE AGE 50 TO 85,
   AND LOOKING TO BUY LIFE   INSURANCE ON A FIXED BUDGET,
     REMEMBER THE THREE P'S.
     -THE THREE P'S?     -WHAT ARE THE THREE P'S?
 THE THREE P'S OF LIFE INSURANCE ON A FIXED BUDGET
        ARE PRICE, PRICE,        AND PRICE.
     A PRICE YOU CAN AFFORD,
   A PRICE THAT CAN'T INCREASE,
      AND A PRICE      THAT FITS YOUR BUDGET.
   I'M 65 AND TAKE MEDICATIONS.
         WHAT'S MY PRICE?
       YOU CAN GET COVERAGE       FOR $9.95 A MONTH.
        I JUST TURNED 80.
         WHAT'S MY PRICE?
          $9.95 A MONTH          FOR YOU TOO.
       CALL NOW ABOUT       THE #1 MOST POPULAR
    WHOLE LIFE INSURANCE PLAN,
    AVAILABLE THROUGH    THE COLONIAL PENN PROGRAM.
       NO MEDICAL EXAM,       NO HEALTH QUESTIONS.
         YOUR ACCEPTANCE         IS GUARANTEED.
      SO CALL NOW      FOR FREE INFORMATION.
 I DON'T CALL THEM RAIDS, I SAY THEY CAME IN ILLEGALLY AND
 WE BRING THEM OUT LEGALLY.
 THEY WILL BE STARTING FAIRLY
 SOON, BUT I DON'T CALL THEM
 RAIDS.
 THAT WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP
 EARLIER TALKING ABOUT THE I.C.E.
 RAIDS THAT HE'S BEEN PROMISING.
 THE PRESIDENT INITIALLY DELAYED
 THE RAIDS ON JUNE 22nd, A DAY
 BEFORE THEY WERE SET TO BEGIN
 SAYING HE'D GIVE CONGRESS TWO
 WEEKS TO WORK ON ASYLUM LAWS AND
 HALT THE FLOW OF U.S. MIGRANTS.
 BUT SINCE THEN NO COMPREHENSIVE
 IMMIGRATION REFORM DEAL HAS BEEN
 REACHED.
 WITH ME NOW JOHN, GOOD TO SEE
 YOU AGAIN.
 THIS IS TRICKY, WHETHER THE
 PRESIDENT WANTS TO CALL THEM
 RAIDS OR NOT, THEY ARE SOME SORT
 OF ENFORCEMENT ACTION THAT
 REQUIRES SOME DEGREE OF
 PLANNING.
 AND THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE YOU
 AND I TALKED ABOUT THIS LAST
 TIME.
 THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE WHO SAID
 THE PRESIDENT BY CONTINUING TO
 ANNOUNCE THESE THINGS AND TALK
 ABOUT THEM IN THE MEDIA ACTUALLY
 COMPROMISES THE WORK THAT HE
 MIGHT BE TRYING TO ACHIEVE.
 YEAH.
 THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
 LISTEN, HAVING BEEN INVOLVED IN
 A NUMBER OF THESE OPERATIONS AND
 WHETHER YOU CALL THEM RAIDS OR
 WHATEVER YOU CALL THEM, THESE
 ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.
 THE NUMBER ONE RULE IS YOU DON'T
 TIP THE TARGET IN ADVANCE
 BECAUSE THEN WHEN YOU GO TO THE
 HOUSE OF THE LOCATION WHERE YOU
 THINK THAT TARGET IS, THEY ARE
 SIMPLY NOT THERE.
 AT THE BEGINNING OF THE
 OPERATION WE'D GET SOMETHING
 LIKE 90% OF THE PEOPLE WE WERE
 GOING AFTER.
 BUT AFTER TIME THAT WAS
 DISSIPATE AND PEOPLE FLED AND
 HID.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SAID THAT
 PUBLIC SAFETY IS THE REASON FOR
 THESE RAIDS BUT NEW DOCUMENTS
 ACTUALLY SHOW THAT I.C.E. IS
 BUILDING TARGET LISTS FOR THESE
 MASS ROUNDUPS OF PEOPLE BASED ON
 TARGET NUMBERS THAT THEY HAVE TO
 MEET.
 SO THE QUESTION IS DO THESE
 PUBLIC DOCUMENTS, YOU KNOW,
 THESE THINGS SORT OF HURT THE
 ARGUMENT THAT THERE'S A PUBLIC
 SAFETY NEED FOR THESE RAIDS?
 ALI, IT'S NOT GOING TO BE
 PUBLIC SAFETY.
 THE PROBLEM HERE IS THIS.
 THE PRESIDENT WANTS BIG NUMBERS.
 BUT TO GET BIG NUMBERS WHAT,
 THAT REQUIRES TYPICALLY IS YOU
 GO AFTER THE MOST VULNERABLE
 POPULATION.
 THE CRIMINAL ALE YETION
 POPULATION IS ACTUALLY THE MOST
 DIFFICULT TO FIND.
 THEY'RE ADEPT AT HIDING AND
 USING ALIASES.
 IT TAKES MUCH MORE LEG WORK THAN
 IT DOES A FAMILY WITH CHILDREN
 WHO ARE SITTING IN A STATIC
 LOCATION.
 SO I DON'T THINK THIS OPERATION
 AT ALL IS GOING TO PROMOTE
 PUBLIC SAFETY.
 YOU COULD ARGUE THAT IT HELPS
 PROMOTE THE INTEGRITY OF OUR
 IMMIGRATION COURT SYSTEM OR THE
 BORDER SECURITY BUT CERTAINLY
 NOT PUBLIC SAFETY.
 THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS
 THREATENING TO IMPOSE HUGE FINES
 ON PEOPLE WHO DISOBEY
 DEPORTATION ORDERS.
 SOME OF THEM UPWARDS OF

 TALK TO ME ABOUT THAT.
 WELL, I MEAN, THERE ARE
 CERTAIN SITUATIONS IN THE LAW IN
 WHICH YOU CAN IMPOSE A FINE ON
 AN INDIVIDUAL.
 I CAN TELL YOU COLLECTING IT IS
 A DIFFERENT STORY ENTIRELY.
 I AM NOT SURE HOW THEY INTEND TO
 COLLECT THEM AGAINST A MAJORITY
 OF THESE INDIVIDUALS.
 IF SOME INDIVIDUAL IS LATER ABLE
 TO LEGALLY ENTER THE UNITED
 STATES, BUT THE REALITY IS THE
 VAST, VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE
 WHO ARE DEPORTED FROM THIS
 COUNTRY ARE NEVER ABLE TO
 LEGALLY RETURN TO THE UNITED
 STATES.
 THERE IS WIDE AGREEMENT ON
 CERTAIN IMMIGRATION ISSUES IN
 THIS COUNTRY.
 FOR INSTANCE, ON THE DREAMERS,
 THE DACA KIDS, THE OVERWHELMING
 SUPPORT FOR HAVING THEM STAY
 HERE BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO FOLLOW
 RULES.
 THEY'VE GROWN UP HERE, THEY ARE
 EITHER GETTING AN EDUCATION OR
 WORKING, THEY CAN'T COMMIT
 SERIOUS CRIMES.
 BUT THERE ARE OTHER
 DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT OTHER BASIC
 THINGS AND SOME DEMOCRATIC
 CANDIDATES HAVE ACTUALLY TALKED
 ABOUT DECRIMINALIZING THE ACT OF
 ILLEGALLY ENTERING THE UNITED
 STATES.
 JOE BIDEN JOE BIDEN SAID TODAY
 THAT ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSINGS
 SHOULD NOT BE DECRIMINALIZED.
 THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING PLACE
 THAT DEMOCRATS ARE IN.
 BECAUSE A LOT OF AMERICANS WHO
 ARE SYMPATHETIC TO IMMIGRANTS
 AND ASYLUM-SEEKERS MAY NOT
 BELIEVE THAT DECRIMINALIZING THE
 ACT OF COMING INTO THE UNITED
 STATES ILLEGALLY SHOULD BE PART
 OF THE EQUATION.
 YEAH.
 I AGREE WITH THE VICE PRESIDENT
 ON THIS ONE.
 LISTEN, IF YOU COME ACROSS THE
 BORDER WITHOUT INSPECTING, THAT
 IS A CRIME, IT'S A MISDEMEANOR
 OFFENSE FOR YOUR FIRST OFFENSE.
 SO IT'S NOT THAT SERIOUS OF
 CRIME, BUT IT SHOULD REMAIN A
 CRIME.
 LOOK, THERE IS A ROLE FOR BORDER
 SECURITY, BORDER ENFORCEMENT.
 THERE IS A ROLE FOR.
 I THINK A LOT OF ISSUE WITH THE
 MANNER IN WHICH THIS
 ADMINISTRATION IS DEALING WITH
 THAT IS A DETRIMENT TO PUBLIC
 SAFETY.
 THEY ARE FOCUSED ON VULNERABLE.
 BECAUSE OF THE PRESIDENT'S
 POLICIES THAT WE ARE NOW LOOKING
 AT IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT IN
 LARGE RATHER THAN QUESTIONING
 THE SPECIFIC TACTICS THIS
 ADMINISTRATION IS DOING WHEN
 THERE IS AN IMPORTANT ROLE FOR
 ALL OF OUR PUBLIC SAFETY IN THE
 FUNCTIONS THAT I.C.E. AND CVP DO
 EVERY IDEA.
 BUT WHAT THE DOES -IS WHAT
 THE PRESIDENT IS DOING, IS THAT
 PLAYING INTO THE HANDS OF THE
 PRESIDENT HIMSELF BECAUSE HE
 PROVOKES A REACTION THAT CAUSES
 SOME DEMOCRATS TO SAY LET'S
 DECRIMINALIZE THE OPERATION AND
 THEN THE PRESIDENT CAN GO OUT
 AND SAY THAT SOUNDS LIKE OPEN
 BORDERS WHICH HE'S BEEN ACCUSING
 DEMOCRATS OF EMBRACING THE WHOLE
 TIME?
 I THINK THAT'S RIGHT, ALI.
 I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, LOOK.
 A LOT OF THE PRESIDENT'S CHATTER
 REALLY IS IDLE THREATS.
 HE'S TALKED ABOUT A MILLION
 PEOPLE APPREHENDED.
 I.C.E. HAS NO CAPACITY TO ARREST
 A MILLION PEOPLE.
 AN OPERATION LIKE THIS IN A
 TWO-WEEK PERIOD IS GOING TO GET
 5,000 AND THAT'S PROBABLY OPT
 MIST.
 BUT IT DOES TRIGGER THIS
 REACTION OF THIS ABOLISH I.C.E.
 I THINK THE MAJORITY OF THE
 PUBLIC RECOGNIZES THAT I.C.E.
 PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN OUR
 PUBLIC SAFETY.
 I DO THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE, NOT
 ENOUGH RECOGNIZE TOO THAT ISIS
 IS A CRITICAL PLAYER IN THE
 COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORT.
 THEY SAVE MORE CHILDREN FROM
 EXPLOITATION THAN ANY OTHER
 FEDERAL AGENCY, STOPPING NORTH
 KOREA AND IRAN FROM GETTING
 SENSITIVE TECHNOLOGIES.
 BUT IT PLAYS INTO THE HANDS WHEN
 YOU START TALKING ABOUT THESE
 EXTREMIST POSITIONS THAT WE NEED
 TO GET RID OF THE BORDER PATROL
 OR I.C.E. SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE
 ADMINISTRATION'S POLICIES, NOT
 NECESSARILY BECAUSE OF THE
 AGENCIES THEMSELVES.
 JOHN IS A FORMER ACTING
 DIRECTOR OF I.C.E.
 COMING UP NEXT WE ARE GOING
 TO TAKE A LOOK AT AMERICA'S
 ENERGY REVOLUTION.
 FOR THE FIRST TIME THE UNITED
 STATES IS PRODUCING MORE ENERGY
 FROM RENEWABLES THAN IT IS
 FROMCOAL.
 I'M GOING TO TALK TO AN AUTHOR

 ALL RIGHT. WE ARE TAKING A CLOSER LOOK INTO
 A BIG ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY IN
 THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE
 CHANGE.
 CLEAN ENERGY.
 HERE'S SOMETHING YOU MAY HAVE
 MISSED.
 FOR THE FIRST TIME OUR CAPACITY
 FOR CREATING ELECTRICITY FROM
 RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES
 SURPASSED THAT FOR COAL.
 AS THE L.A. TIMES POINTS OUT,
 DOMESTIC COAL PRODUCTION AND USE
 HAVE DROPPED TO THEIR LOWEST
 LEVELS IN FOUR DECADES EVEN
 THOUGH THE ECONOMY IS MORE THAN
 TWICE THE SIZE IT WAS 40 YEARS
 AGO.
 ADDITIONALLY, MORE COAL-FIRED
 POWER PLANTS HAVE SHUT DOWN SO
 FAR DURING THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY
 THAN THROUGH ALL EIGHT YEARS OF
 THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.
 AND IT MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO
 WITH THE COST.
 LET ME SHOW YOU A MAP OF THE
 LEAST EXPENSIVE TECHNOLOGIES FOR
 GENERATING ELECTRICITY ACROSS
 THE UNITED STATES BY COUNTY.
 HERE YOU CAN SEE HOW -LET ME
 JUST SHOW YOU THE COLORS HERE.
 THE BLUE IS WIND.
 GREEN IS NATURAL GAS.
 THE YELLOW -THE GOLD IS SOLAR,
 THE YELLOW IS ALSO SOLAR.
 ONE OF THEM IS FOR UTILITIES
 THAT GENERATE ELECTRICITY.
 THE LIGHTER YELLOW IS FOR
 RESIDENTIAL USE AND THE GRAY OF
 COURSE IS COAL.
 COAL REPRESENTS THE SMALLEST
 PROPORTION.
 JOINING ME NOW IS RUSSELL GOLD.
 HE IS A SENIOR ENERGY REPORTER
 FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL" AND
 OFFER OF A NEW BOOK, SUPERPOWER.
 ONE MAN'S QUEST TO TRANSFORM
 ENERGY.
 IT PROFILES MICHAEL SKELLY WHO
 BEGAN DEVELOPING WIND ENERGY
 INFRASTRUCTURE AND WENT ON TO
 BUILD THE SECOND LARGEST WIND
 POWER COMPANY IN THE UNITED
 STATES.
 THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
 THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
 I WANT TO JUST READ FROM YOUR
 BOOK.
 YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT MICHAEL
 SKELLY.
 AND YOU SAID HE WAS A DEPARTURE
 FROM WIND FARM BUILDER WHO WERE
 MORE INTERESTED IN CREATING
 SUSTAINABLE ENERGY THAN
 SUSTAINABLE BUSINESSES.
 SKELLY WANTED TO MAKE A PROFIT
 BECAUSE PROFITS WOULD ATTRACT
 NEW INVESTORS AND MONEY INTO
 RENEWABLE ENERGY THIS HAS LONG
 BEEN THE HOLY GRAIL.
 IF YOU CAN MAKE SUSTAINABLE AND
 RENEWABLE, PROFITABLE, IT CAN
 REPLACE SORT OF OLDER-FASHIONED
 DIRTIER ENERGY.
 AND WE ARE SEEING THAT HAPPEN
 RIGHT NOW.
 WITH THE MAP YOU JUST BROUGHT UP
 THERE IS A BIG PART OF THE
 MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY WHERE YOU
 CAN GENERATE WIND AT A REALLY
 LOW COST.
 THE QUESTION RIGHT NOW IS HOW
 FAST CAN THAT TRANSITION HAPPEN?
 HOW FAST CAN YOU BRING IN MORE
 RENEWABLES AT THIS LOWER PRICE?
 AND WHAT ARE THE HEADWINDS
 AND WHAT ARE THE TAILWINDS FOR
 PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO BRING
 RENEWABLE ENERGY TO MARKET
 FASTER?
 WELL, TAILWINDS RIGHT NOW AS
 WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ARE
 COST.
 RENEWABLE ENERGY, WIND, AND
 INCREASINGLY SOLAR, IS THE
 LOW-COST WAY TO GENERATE
 ELECTRICITY.
 IT BEATS COAL, INCREASINGLY IT
 BEATS NATURAL GAS, AND IT BEATS
 NUCLEAR.
 THE HEADWINDS ARE RIGHT NOW
 WHERE YOU CAN GENERATE RENEWABLE
 ENERGY INEXPENSIVELY IS THE
 MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY.
 AND THAT'S NOT EXACTLY WHERE THE
 FACTORIES ARE, THE PEOPLE ARE.
 SO THE QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU
 GET THAT ELECTRICITY FROM THE
 MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY TO THE
 COASTS?
 AND THAT'S ONE OF THE CHALLENGES
 THAT MICHAEL SKELLY TACKLED AND
 I WROTE ABOUT IN MY NEW BOOK
 "SUPERPOWER."
 I WOULD SAY ONE OF THE MAJOR
 HEADWINDS ARE ELECTRIC UTILITIES
 AND GENERATORS WHO DON'T WANT
 THIS CHANGED BECAUSE QUITE
 FRANKLY THEY ARE VERY GOOD AT
 GENERATING ELECTRICITY FROM COAL
 AND FROM SOME OF THE OLDER
 RESOURCES, AND THEY DON'T WANT
 TO MAKE THIS CHANGE BECAUSE THAT
 WOULD MEAN LESS OPPORTUNITY FOR
 THEM.
 MOST PEOPLE SWITCH ON A LIGHT
 AND HOPE THAT IT GOES ON.
 THEY DON'T THINK MUCH ABOUT THE
 BACKBONE AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE
 OF WHERE THEIR POWER COMES FROM.
 WHAT IS REQUIRED?
 WHAT ARE THE INFRASTRUCTURE
 REQUIREMENTS TO MAKE A WHOLESALE
 SHIFT INTO RENEWABLES?
 WELL, FIRST OF ALL THAT'S A
 GREAT QUESTION.
 FIRST OF ALL I'M NOT TALKING
 ABOUT 100% RENEWABLE
 ELECTRICITY.
 RIGHT.
 BECAUSE ONCE YOU GET ABOVE
 08% IT GETS REALLY EXPENSIVE.
 BUT WE CAN GET UP TO 70, 80% OF
 OUR ELECTRICITY COMING FROM
 RENEWABLE RESOURCES AT THE SAME
 PRICES OR PERHAPS EVEN LOWER
 THAN WE ARE RIGHT NOW WHAT'S
 REQUIRED THE BIG PIECE OF
 INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S REQUIRED
 IS TRANSMISSION.
 THESE ARE BIG ELECTRICITY LINES
 THAT CAN MOVE GIGAWATTS OF
 ELECTRICITY AROUND.
 THINK ABOUT IT LIKE YOUR
 INTERSTATE HIGHWAYS.
 WE HAVE TWO-LANE ROADS GOING ALL
 OVER THE PLACE.
 IN THE 1950s WE SAID LET'S BUILD
 THESE HIGHWAYS SO WE CAN MOVE
 PEOPLE QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY
 FROM ONE CITY TO ANOTHER.
 THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE NEED TO DO
 RIGHT NOW WITH OUR TRANSMISSION.
 I APPRECIATE THE BOOK AND I
 APPRECIATE YOU COMING TO TALK
 ABOUT IT.
 HE IS THE AUTHOR OF THE NEW BOOK
 "SUPERPOWER."
 STILL AHEAD A JUDGE GAVE
 LENIENCY TO A TEENAGE RAPE
 SUSPECT BECAUSE THE JUDGE SAID
 THE TEEN CAME FROM A GOOD
 FAMILY.
 I AM GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW
 THIS CASE FITS INTO A BROADER
 CASE.
 HE CAME FROM A GOOD FAMILY, A JUDGE USED THAT EXCUSE TO SHOW
 LENIENCY TO A SUSPECT ACCUSED OF
 SEXUAL ASSAULT AND IT'S
 PROMPTING RENEWED DEBATE ABOUT
 RAPE CULTURE IN THE UNITED
 STATES.
 THE CASE CAME FROM NEW JERSEY
 WHERE A JUDGE DENIED THE REQUEST
 TO TREAT THE 16-YEAR-OLD AS AN
 ADULT, WHERE THE ASSAULT WAS
 RECORDED AND SENT TO A VIDEO
 TEXT SAYING, WHEN THE FIRST TIME
 WITH SEX WAS RAPE.
 HE COULD BE ACCUSED IN JUVENILE
 COURT CASE AS 15 YEARS OR OLDER
 BUT THE FAMILY COURT JUDGE
 DENIED THE PROSECUTOR'S MOTION
 SAYING THE THE SALT WASN'T RAPE
 SAYING THIS YOUNG MAN CAME FROM
 A GOOD FAMILY WHERE HE WAS DOING
 VERY WELL.
 AND HE WAS A CANDIDATE NOT JUST
 FOR COLLEGE BUT A VERY GOOD
 COLLEGE.
 HIS SCORES FOR COLLEGE ENTRY
 WERE VERY HIGH.
 STATE APPEALS COURT ALREADY
 OVERTURNED THE JUDGE'S DECISION
 BUT THE CASE UNDERSCORES A
 FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE IN THE WAY
 THIS COUNTRY VIEWS RAPE AND
 SEXUAL ASSAULT.
 TO TALK TO THOSE ISSUE I TALK TO
 MISS BURKE, THE FOUNDER OF THE
 ME TOO MOVEMENT.
 YOU HAVE REALLY APPROACHED THIS
 FROM A DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY THAT
 WE ARE LOOKING AT A LOW BASE
 FROM UNDERSTANDING OF THESE
 THINGS AND WHAT IS THE BEST WAY
 TO GET US TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE
 SEXUAL VIOLENCE IS ALL ABOUT.
 THIS IS WHY THE CONVERSATION
 HAS TO SHIFT BETWEEN WHAT ME TOO
 IS.
 THIS WHOLE GLARING CASE IS
 THERE'S NO CONVERSATION ABOUT
 THE SURVIVAL, HER GRADES, HOW
 HER LIFE CHANGED AND IT'S
 FOCUSED TOTALLY ON THIS
 PERPETRATOR.
 THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS A LOT.
 WHEN I REALIZE MORE SO IN THE
 PAST FEW YEARS IS PEOPLE DON'T
 UNDERSTAND THE LIFE CYCLE OF A
 SURVIVOR.
 THEY DON'T WHAT SEXUAL VIOLENCE
 IS OR IT DOES TO THE PEOPLE THAT
 EXPERIENCE IT.
 SO YOU HAVE CASES LIKE THIS
 HAPPEN WHERE YOU HAVE LARGER
 NARRATIVES THAT ARE PATRIARCHAL
 AND MISOGYNISTIC AND WHAT BOYS
 AND GIRLS NEED MORE SO THAN WHO
 THEY VICTIMIZE.
 AND THE SAME ON COLLEGE
 CAMPUSES WHEN WE TALK ABOUT BOYS
 HAVING THEIR FUTURES RUINED
 BECAUSE OF THE WAY THEIR
 ASSAULTS WERE BEING TREATED.
 WHAT DOES THE ASSAULT LOOK FOR
 YOU LIKE ON THIS FRONT?
 I DON'T THIB ANYBODY THAT'S A
 PERPETRATOR NEEDS ALL OF THE
 BOOK THROWN AT THEM BUT WE'RE
 NOT LISTENING TO THE OTHER SIDE,
 WE'RE NOT BALANCING OUT VICTIMS'
 RIGHTS WITH PERPETRATORS'
 RIGHTS.
 THIS IS IT WHEN ME TOO CAME
 TOGETHER, WE HAD PEOPLE SAYING
 MY LIFE HAD BEEN AFFECTED BY
 THIS THING.
 WE HAVE YET TO TALK ABOUT THAT
 THING AND WHAT SEXUAL VIOLENCE
 IS AND HOW IT IMPACTS PEOPLE IN
 THIS COUNTRY.
 WHAT IT WILL TAKE IS A SHIFT IN
 THE NARRATIVE ABOUT HOW WE TALK
 ABOUT SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND HOW WE
 TALK ABOUT THIS MOVEMENT.
 THIS IS A MOVEMENT THAT'S ABOUT
 HEALING AND ACTION.
 THE HEALING AND ACTION PART OF
 THAT IS BASED ON HOW WE EDUCATE
 PEOPLE AROUND SEXUAL VIOLENCE.
 HOW WE EDUCATE PEOPLE AROUND
 WHAT SURVIVAL LOOKS LIKE.
 WHEN WE SHIFT A NARRATIVE, WHEN
 PEOPLE ARE MORE EDUCATED ABOUT
 THIS.
 THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO VOTE,
 PEOPLE WHO MAKE LEGISLATIVE
 DECISIONS, THEY HAVE TO
 UNDERSTAND THIS CAN'T COME FROM
 THIS SORT OF POP CULTURE
 SALACIOUS HEADLINE PLACE.
 IT HAS TO COME FROM A PLACE
 WHERE THEY HAVE EMPATHY AND
 UNDERSTANDING FOR WHAT SURVIVAL
 IS.
 YOU HO DO WE GET THERE,
 BECAUSE YOU AND I TALKED ABOUT
 THIS BEFORE WHEN THE PEOPLE
 ACCUSED OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR
 ASSAULT ARE NOT MEDIA OR
 POLITICIANS OR CEOs OF MAJOR
 COMPANIES, HAS THIS TRICKLED
 DOWN TO HELP VICTIMS OF SEXUAL
 VIOLENCE WHO DON'T HAVE A NAME,
 WHO ARE HOMELESS, WHO ARE
 IMMIGRANTS, WHO ARE SINGLE
 MOTHERS AND WORK ON A FACTORY
 FLOOR?
 THAT'S OUR WORK.
 THAT'S WHAT THE ME TOO
 ORGANIZATION IS ABOUT AND WE
 HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE DOING THIS
 WORK ON THE GROUND.
 I'M APPRECIATIVE INTO COMING
 INTO PLACES LIKE THIS AND BE
 ABLE TORM TALK ABOUT IT ON A
 NATIONAL FRONT.
 THIS IS HOW WE CHANGE IT.
 PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THIS
 WORK IS HAPPENING.
 IT WAS HAPPENING BEFORE ME TOO
 WENT VIRAL AND CONTINUING TO
 HAPPEN.
 PART OF WHAT WE DO IS EDUCATE
 PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT THIS IS.
 PART OF THE WORK THAT OTHER
 ORGANIZATIONS DO, OTHER NATIONAL
 ORGANIZATIONS, LAW CENTER AND
 OTHER ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THAT
 ARE EDUCATING PEOPLE BUT WE'RE
 ALSO GALVANIZING PEOPLE.
 PEOPLE ASK WHAT IS THE ME TOO
 MOVEMENT GOING TO DO ABOUT X?
 I'M SAYING WE'RE ALL THE ME TOO
 MOVEMENT.
 WE ALL HAVE TO BE RESPONSIVE.
 WE HAVE ALL SPOB RESPONSIBLE
 WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS
 WE ALL HAVE TO BE OUTRAGED AND
 PUSHED BACK.
 HISTORICALLY JUDICIAL SYSTEMS
 AND POLITICAL SYSTEMS HAVE TO
 CATCH UP TO WHERE THE PEOPLE

     With all that USAA offers
     why go with anybody else?
       We know       their rates are good,
       we know that they're
         always going to         take care of us.
   It was an instant savings and
      I should have changed      a long time ago.
       It was funny because       when we would call
    another insurance company,
      hey would say      “Oh we can't beat USAA”

             He like held my hand             for a while.
               And then we got               to meet him after,               which was like...
 Another surprise.                            Yeah.
