and everyone that's involved in it. This is a rough business, you know, in Mykonos, and it's only getting busier, so I really don't have time to take any weak links in. I don't know. I'm not sure what I'm gonna do. Okay, boss. Lindsay comes out of nowhere. I feel like I'm gonna throw up right now. We decided to send you to see your grandmother. Oh, my God, yes. Oh, my gosh. I wanna milk a goat. Wow, never felt more loved in my life. It's my first time firing someone ever in my life. I have a brand and a business, and I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to let you go. Lately, my relationship with Chloe has gotten pretty tense... Stop Don't push me, honey. Don't put your hands on me. ...and it's all because of Alex's ex Cara. Cara's definitely his kryptonite. he would come over if I asked him to. If you're siand rea, we should definitely exchange numbers. Garrett's so naive, he actually thinks he has a shot with her. You look beautiful. Thank you. Poor guy's still rebounding from Kelsey, who's being her usual hot mess. How are things with the whole boyfriend? He's in Arizona. But Kelsey's commitment issues are nothing compared to Madisson's. So what's the deal with you guys? We're both like, single. If I tried to be exclusive with you, I could like, ruin however we are. Ben's a dog and she knows it. You are being a brat right now. I thought my own relationship was so much better than any of theirs... I do everything for you. That's not fair. ...but after tonight, I just don't know. Why do you want to do this right now? You're an idiot. Do you not see how rude that is? Why would you say that? [Music] I had a dream or was it real? [Music] [Music] We crossed the line and it was on [Music] [Music] I [Music] We crossed the line [Music] or was it real? [Music] [Music] It was on this time ah-ah-ah [Music] [Music] I wanna cut through the clouds [Music] [Music] Break the ceiling [Music] [Music] I wanna dance on the roof [Music] [Music] You and me alone [Music] [Music] I wanna cut to the feeling, oh, yeah [Music] [Music] I wanna cut to the feeling [Music] [Music] I wanna cut to the feeling [Music][Music] Can you stop acting like a drama queen? 'Cause I didn't do anything wrong. I don't wanna talk about it right now. All right, whatever. Why can't you just be like, I'm sorry I made you upset? Listen to me, you're upset because all he ever does is say, I do this for you, and I do this for you. And you're feeling like, I do all these things for you and you're making me feel like a bad girlfriend when I'm not. Wait, how did you know that? Because that's exactly right. Chloe has a way of knowing things. I love you, and you're not wrong. You guys just have to communicate properly. I'm gonna go to the bathroom and fix my face. You look fine, but go. You look good. Go fix your face. So... so far, who do you like and who do you not like? I'll just say I have my interests. Honestly, at this point, I could care less. Did you see apparently... They went on the beach. Look. But look. They go to the beach at 2:30 in the morning. Jared literally posted a picture in his... Like, what, did Kelsey take that? Did her and her boyfriend break up? No. I respect that you have a boyfriend. But I think you're drop-dead gorgeous. You better. Hey... we'll see. [Music] I am the bonfire [Music] [Music] You make me stronger, you make me lighter [Music] ■■■■ [Music] With the shade you throw on me... [Music][Music] Cara totally thinks she's the new it girl of Siesta Key. Hi, how are you? Hi! Sure, she's got a sick beach house... Your place is literally insane. ...and she loves to party. mes with my boyfriend. It's like, so obvious that he still has a thing for me. And now she's talking to my ex Garrett. I'm really not posting that. It's a good picture, though, why not? Second date? It's far too soon. Story? No. Maybe put like, you know, Chillin' in paradise with a little palm tree emoji. Stories get people in trouble. Did you see, um, Kelsey and Jared hung out the other night on Jared's story? Oh, yeah, I did. They were like, skinny-dipping. Isn't she worried her boyfriend might see that? That's awkward. Yeah, so I'm definitely not gonna story this then. You know who that would probably piss off? Who? Juliette. All these exes of yours that I have to worry about. No, second date, it's already been better than any date I've been on with Juliette. Aww, that's so sweet, thank you. You got it. All right, why am I a better date than Juliette? Um, you're a lot more sweeter. Oh, really? Yeah. She's like, said a bunch of stuff like you're still trying to get with Alex. Eww. She says anything she can to hate on me. Well, is that like, not true? I'm not impressed by him like she is, that's for sure. With the money and all that? Yeah, I mean, like, I've been around that kind of (bleep) my whole life. Like, it's not impressive to me. Like, for me, I've always had to work for everything that I've had. Like, growing up like, my parents weren't like, wealthy or anything, but... so I kinda grew up staying humble, but also having somewhat success just from hard work and all that. So what about you-
- Sorry. what're your plans for your future? What do you wanna do? Plans? Yeah, do you have any? I applied to grad school. Oh, yeah? Yeah, for teaching. Like, what do you wanna teach? Kindergarten, first grade, second grade? Yeah? Yeah, I'm good with the little ones. Are you? Yeah. Well, that's always good, you know? If you ever have any of your own. All right, got it. I got it... [Music] Oh, oh, oh, oh [Music] [Music] But this is unexpected [Music] [Music] Oh, oh, oh, oh [Music] [Music] I gotta go but you keep turning me on [Music] [Music] Turning me on [Music][Music] [Music] Bounce, bounce, like a beach ball [Music] [Music] Running 'round in circles... [Music][Music] Whoo, you ready, baby? Hell yeah. I haven't packed yet. m ready to get ready. then you're not ready. There you go, all right. Yo, should I bring the white pants? That's Miami, right? Bring the white pants. You gotta hurry and finish packing. Amanda and Pauly are gonna be here soon. Dude, I hate packing. You're not doing very good. Oh, thanks! Juliette specifically told me Cara is not invited. Of course she did. And I was like, I know. And even though I want you to come... Even though I want to come... I wish I was going, but I feel like there's just gonna be drama with all these rumors going around and stuff. Like that Jared (bleep)? Oh, my God. That Jared (bleep) is literally so stupid. What happened? On the way home, we decided to go to the beach and that was it. Yes, we have chemistry, but I have a boyfriend and I don't wanna ruin that. As long as you and Jacob are good. That's all that matters. Yeah, we're great. I'm very happy about it. We got white buffalo. Let's not do that again. Crazy. Let's not do that again? No, I don't wanna fight with you anymore. No, I don't wanna fight, especially in public. Really? Well, I don't like to do that. 'Cause then everyone's like, What's wrong? I don't wanna fight in general, that's... I mean, we're always gonna get in like, little arguments. Did you see Chloe apologized to me? She seemed like she really wanted to like, rebuild our friendship, and she apologized about Cara and said that she was... Yeah, she admitted to me... ...bringing her around to piss me off. And I was like, at least you admit it. Yeah. I mean, Juliette and I obviously aren't like, back to complete normal. But hopefully in Miami, we can like, rekindle our friendship and like, remember why we were all friends in the beginning. Yeah, I'm just sad, now I have to wait a whole week to see Garrett again. So what is going on with you and Garrett? We've had two dates. Have you kissed? No. We haven't done anything yet. Do you want to? I mean, eventually. But not like, right now. I mean, half the fun of seeing Garrett is that he's always around Alex and Juliette and I know it drives her crazy. I'm kinda glad I'm not going. I wanna spend a little more time with Tawni. What do you mean? Yeah, what is... So we definitely have a connection. We spend so much time together and we're very similar people. For sure. I've always liked Tawni, so maybe I can inch my way into something else. Really? Has she even ever been with a girl? No, but that's not something that I'm not familiar with. Yeah, I guess that's true. Well, I just don't want you falling for someone that can't fall for you back the same way. So just be careful. So guess who's coming? Who? Ben decided to meet us in Miami. Think you guys are gonna talk about like, where you stand and all that, or...? I mean, it's something I'm dreading, but I know that I have to. Mm-hmm. Ben and I have been doing this casual thing for five or six years now. Yeah. Obviously like, I want that commitment from him... Yeah. ...'cause it's just been so surface level for so long. I mean, it's up to you, but I really don't think you should be with someone if they're not gonna be willing to be with you on a deeper level. So Garrett is five minutes out. Oh, perfect timing. I thought I was rushing. So how we gonna do shotgun? Looks like I got shotty, huh? You guys ready? We're ready, man. Hey! Miami! ■■■■T=T=T=T■T Hi! It's nice in here. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my God, babe. It's giant. I know, it's sweet. So you approve? I-
- yeah, I approve! Oh, my God! It's the suite, babe. Oh, my God! It's so beautiful. This is like our own place. Oh, my God! This is so crazy! You like it? [Music] No matter how long you're gone [Music] [Music] I'm always gonna want you back [Music] [Music] I know you know [Music] [Music] I will never get over you xx■■[Music] No matter where I go [Music] [Music] I'm always gonna want you back... [Music][Music] Is Cara coming? I told her she needs to respect the fact that I'm making up with her. Oh, and plus this is like, Juliette's thing. Wait, you're not cool with Cara here? No, I am, I just like, I have to respect the fact that I'm friends with Juliette and Amanda now, and I explained that to her. And I don't like, wanna have to play sides. So like, I'm going to Miami with my friends, I'll see you when I get back. I heard Ben was coming, right? He's on his way, right? Should be. He should've already been here, but... Speak of the guy... Hey! Hi! Cheers, guys. To Miami. It's cool that Alex set this whole thing up for Juliette. I'm glad I got the invite. I'm glad you came. This is like, our first vacay together. We gonna bring out party Madisson? Well... before you get too excited, um... This sounds like bad news. I do want separate rooms. Like conjoining rooms? No like, I'm gonna stay with Amanda and I thought you could have your own room. I was under the impression that like, I'm staying with you. I flew here to like, hang out with you on vacation. And I-
- yeah, and we are gonna hang out, of course. But... I mean, I wanna have separate rooms, and I... Okay, is there any reason? You're not my boyfriend. Us sharing a hotel room, that's like a boyfriend-girlfriend thing. You made it pretty clear to Kelsey the other day that you were single. So like, are we committing, or are we not? Like, why-
- what is-
- what is the hold up? What's wrong with me that, like, you don't want, like, to commit? That's-
- there's nothing wrong with you, Madisson. There's a reason I'm here. I've been screwed over in the past, and wanna be smarter this time. So until we make that commitment to each other, like, I don't want to make that commitment to, like, share a room with you. I will respect whatever you want. Should be a good week, I promise. Coming up... You should come down here. <i> Yay, I'm so excited.</i> If you wanna invite my boyfriend's ex who's probably still trying to hook up with him, don't come to my trip. You can go.

- haven't been here long. As if dating in Siesta Key isn't complicated enough, Canvas is trying to find out if her bestie wants to be more than just friends. I'm enjoying the fact that everyone's in Miami, so we don't have to deal with that. Exactly. Everyone that stayed is cool, so we're good. Don't have to worry about people busting in our night. Is like, the tiki bar you end goal for now? I've been looking into like, um, being a drug rep. I can't think of one normal job. I want so much out of my life and sadly wanna do a little bit of everything. In life or in relationships? Both. I like options. I like variety. Yeah, I need to work more on being a flirt and less of sleeping around. I know, you-
- your roster's pretty full right now. I'm kinda jealous. I don't know why I've always been a person who like-
- I just need the love from other people and I need the reassurance. Honestly, it's not that I'm against relationships, I just know like, I don't like to be vulnerable and I don't like to get my hopes up, like... See, we're very different. You throw walls up immediately to keep from getting hurt, where I am an open book and I just let people in because it's worth it to me to get hurt to actually have a chance at something real. Yeah, see, I think the reason I'm so much like too on top of everything, you know, like, I don't have the greatest relationship with my dad. He completely abandoned me and like, refuses to talk to me. I needed a mom at that point. I needed someone to be able to talk to. And like, when I was 16, she moved to Australia. I can't even imagine. I've needed her in so many situations in my life, and phone calls don't really do it. I'll figure it out hopefully. For sure. So I can maybe understand your jaded opinion on love a little bit. Yeah, you know... What would be your ideal girl? I need someone who can keep up with me. I need someone who can keep up with my mouth. And like, I like broken souls. And just say (bleep) it right now, and I'm just gonna sit my little pretty ass away from like, all emotions. Wait, so y-
- you don't have your eye on anybody right now? I mean... we'll see. [Music] Must've been high [Music] ust've been high... [Music][Music] It's our first night in Miami, and we're all going out to play. Well, almost all of us. Hey, why didn't Madisson come? She was like, exhausted today, so... I know she was tired, but I mean, it's just limited time out here, why not... Yeah, I know, it's Miami. You came out here from Texas, (bleep). Oh, well. I still feel like if I'm gonna be like, making an effort to go see a girl, then I'm staying with her in the same room. Like, I feel like you deserve that as a-
- as a man, like... Yeah. But don't do what I did with Madisson last year. But that's what I'm saying, though, it's cool that she's like, letting you out right now. So you took Cara out, she told me. I did, yeah. How'd it go? It went really good, I thought. She's cool. She's-
- she's a cool girl. So you like her. I'm trying to get her to come here. I'm probably gonna... I don't think that's a good idea. ...maybe FaceTime her. I still wanna get to know her more, and I think like, her coming to visit here and stay in Miami would be a good opportunity for us to have like, a good time. That puts me in a bad position. I just wanna be a good friend to Juliette. I mean, you guys all just sorted things out. So you guys are good... And one of the major rules is Chloe, don't bring Cara around. If you're gonna be around Juliette, just don't be around Cara at the same time. It's not gonna be Chloe bringing her here, it's gonna be Garrett bringing her here. Uh, so I think it'll be all right. I want nothing to do with it. Cheers! <i> Hi!</i> Yeah, I talked to Chloe. I mean, I know that you maybe have talked to her already and the whole Juliette situation. But, um, and she was like, cool about it, so... [Music] I'm just curious [Music][Music] Cheers.

Of course Cara would find a way to scam her way into my vacation. Is Cara coming? He said Cara's coming, yeah. The only question was who to blame? Don't be upset. I'm just like... No one knew it was happening until tonight. You probably did, Chloe. I didn't, no. Garrett just asked me tonight, it was so (bleep) annoying. Why do you give a (bleep)? Like, clearly I didn't invite her. No one's attacking you. Yeah, stop attacking. Don't attack her about it. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Why do you care? Why wouldn't I care? It's just weird. No one invited her. It's annoying. Garrett's not thinking about Juliette, Garrett's thinking about him. This trip is for her. It's up to Juliette. I think Garrett shouldn't be (bleep) Cara. Garrett can do a lot better. No offense, I know you're friends with her. But I didn't invite her, so I have nothing to do... No, I'm just saying, I don't mind her it's just I know she pisses one of my best friends off. What a desperate person. Hi, Garrett. Yo, homie. Why would you invite Cara here? Uh, I'm trying to get to know her better. So you should go know her better in Sarasota. Where you going, Juliette? It's just like, you should just use common sense that it's like, incredibly rude. I told him. I told him. If you wanna invite my boyfriend's ex who's probably still trying to hook up with him, don't come on my trip. You can go, you can leave. go to a different hotel. Baby... That's literally so (bleep) rude. Coming up... So you can sit here and tell me that you don't think we have any chemistry together?

So how are things? Kelsey's meeting me here to talk. Ahem. Yikes. You sound like you're about to have a fun conversation. Probably. It's okay. Well, you know, I'm always here to get you drunk afterwards. Or get you drunk now. Thank you. Yeah. Speaking of, I had a very interesting night the other night. With whom? With Tawni. So that's a thing. Um, I don't know if it's a thing exactly yet. Hopefully, we'll see. I want the dirty deets. I want all of it. Juicy details. Fill me up.

You're the talk of the Key right now. No clue what you're talkin' about. Oh, 'cause I didn't get the Snapchats you sent me. I don't remember the last time I went skinny-dipping at a beach with a nice guy and didn't do anything inappropriate. Yeah, I mean, I had a great time with Kelsey. I mean, she's a lot of fun. We get along well together, so... Um, she's a lot of fun and you had a great time? ■8Like, how great of a time Well, a lady never tells, Canvas.■■■■■■■ But it was, uh, eventful and exciting.

It's fine, you're my guest. I'll take care of it. Okay, so you have-
- Yeah, please. If there's any problems, I'm there. You're there with me. You'll make sure nothing goes wrong? Make sure of it, yeah. Ready to drink? Yeah, definitely need a drink. Let's do it. [Music] Ready or not, baby, here I come [Music][Music] I'm trying like, so hard to have fun in Miami. And everything was awesome until Garrett invited Cara. q>q= I just hope he's not dumb enough to bring her like, to this bar. Oh, no, he probably-
- he's probably dumb enough. Are you low-key kinda happy she's coming? No, I wish she wasn't. Like, I wanna have fun with my friends and now that she's here, now I'm put in the position of, like... who can I hang out with? But, at the end of the day, I'm hanging out with Juliette. If she has an issue with that, then she should not have came. Well, I appreciate that. [Music] You should see me in a crown [Music] [Music] I'm gonna run this nothing town [Music] [Music] Watch me make 'em bow one by one [Music] Hey. Can I talk to you? [Music] One by, one by [Music] [Music] You should me in a crown [Music][Music] What's up? Well, like, I'm hearing from everyone about what happened the beach night. I don't understand why you care so much what everyone thinks. I mean, it's kind of a big deal for me. It might not be for me 'cause you're single, but, like, I have a boyfriend, so it kind of (bleep) up my relationship. Okay, well, if you had a boyfriend that was, like, a serious relationship, you know... I know what? Things wouldn't have happened. You kissed me, I didn't kiss you. And I pushed away and I left. I wouldn't say you pushed away, but yeah, you left. Seriously? Yeah. Wow. This might (bleep) up my whole entire relationship. I don't think long distance is for you. 'Kay. It's just not for you. Whenever that ends, I'll still be here. Well, it better not be ending because of you. So you can sit here and tell me that you don't think we have any chemistry together at all? I am in a relationship and I have a boyfriend, and that's a whole different type of feelings. Right. I mean, you can have your whole different type of feelings, you can do your long distance relationship, whatever... what you got going on. What I have going on-
- Jacob's about to come in town, and I want to keep this quiet right now. You and I are friends, and we're never gonna be anything else. You need to understand that. Yeah, understand you leading me on I hope you enjoy your ghost boyfriend thing. You're a (bleep) dick. Have a good one. Coming up... What is your problem?

- there's so many weird relationships going on right now. What about Ben and Madisson? He flew all the way from Texas and they're not even sleeping in the same room together. They're not? No. No, they're not. Yo, Ben! Are you guys staying in the same room, or no? Last night I was out at a bar until 2:00, and she went to bed at 9:00 pm. But you got two separate rooms? Yeah. We have two separate rooms, yeah. Guys, we're still, like, figuring things out. It's going somewhere. Give Ben a chance. I'm... I'm working on it, Paul. You're such a romantic. Invite him over. He has been over. We're good. Here, Pauly, we'll send you some Snaps next time. Look, they're doing it, okay? Guys, they (bleep). Get over it. Like, shut up.

I was just asking how you guys are. Like, you're here together. We're good friends. Thank you for asking. No, genuinely, we are good friends. Thank you for asking. Good. I thought that was a great question. I did, too, but apparently they didn't. I thought it was a normal, polite question. And I-
- Did I not answer it politely? No, you didn't answer it. How? Just wasn't polite, the way you answered it. I said We're good, thank you. You don't know what polite is. Am I the only one that thinks this is an awkward situation? a It's a little (bleep) scenario. Like, it's blown out of proportion at this point. You definitely added to it, Garrett. Did I? Yeah. Dude, like, you won't even make eye contact with me. 'Cause I don't want you here. Like, are we not over this? It's like, what is your problem? Babe... It's not that-
- I don't have, like, a problem with you personally, I just don't want you here. Okay, and I understand that, but I want you to understand I'm not here to interfere with your relationship. I don't want my boyfriend's ex-girlfriend here. I think that's very fine. Okay, but, like, he also (bleep) all of your other friends. That was a year ago. Is that not... You're really gonna say that? You're not even welcome here. You're really gonna bring that up in front of everyone? Okay... All right, I'm gonna-
- I'm gonna pour everybody some shots, don't worry. You really wanna have this conversation and you wanna say something like that, it better not be in front of all these people. One, two, three... I'm uncomfortable. Are you uncomfortable? ause I'm uncomfortable. I don't wanna get in this argument but, like, ause I'm uncomfortable. I think you're somewhat of a smart person. I would hope. Garrett, not so sure. But, you know, like, you should know I'm not your biggest fan. Would I want you here at this, like, intimate little trip? You-
- I think you know that. What have I done to you, Juliette, personally? The fact that you're even here, Cara, is proving my point. Right? But what have I done to you? All right. Okay, I just answered your question. Nothing. Okay, so I'll reiterate my point. Say it one more time. And the fact that you're even here is proving my point. Do I need to say it again? Sure, go ahead. Anyone didn't hear that? Can you say it again, though? We heard it. No, we heard it. Don't be rude. I'm-
- No, dawg, I'm not being rude. I just, like-
- You are being rude. You're just being sarcastic. No, I'm not. I'm not. You're half-deaf, half-rude, mostly stupid. Coming up... I miss you and, like, it sucks.

Can't drink all day unless you start in the morning. Speaking of last night, where's, uh, Cara at? But last night was fun, like, with her. Cara came to my room this morning. Mm-hm. She was in her clothes from last night. Oh, boy! And her makeup. And she goes, Well, like, nothing happened, but he did go down on me. I mean, there you go, bro. She had fun. For sure. The night definitely ended better thThat's for sure. She's like, Well, I'm just a little worried, because I feel like it's, like, him, like, compensating for something else. She's worried about... No way! To today and maybe all the way! All the way! Let's do it. So, how are you feeling about the whole, like, Cara thing and everything? This situation, like, the fact that she came into this on Juliette's weekend, and it... it a little bit worries me, like, what her intentions are. Well, now it's like she has to understand, like, if you're coming here, like, I can't be, like, BFFs with you and, like, of course I can be nice and stuff, but, like, I'm here for Juliette. And, like-
- so she is my first priority. When we were having dinner, like, on the rooftop, Juliette was, like, literally, like, letting Cara see all her emotions, and then Cara was just sitting there so calm and relaxed... Yeah. ...and, like, smiling, and I was like, Oh, that must kill Juliette. Like, that sucks. It seemed like Cara was almost too vindictive and, like, patronizing, and I hope I'm wrong. My hope is that she really does like Garrett, and that's, like, why she's here. I would hope so. So, how are things? You glad Ben's here? I'm really glad. I'm still going to... figure out where we really are. Yeah. And, in this group, it's a little more intense. It's like, What are you guys doing? What rooms are you staying in? Like, who's sleeping with who? What's happening? Do you feel, like, pressured, you mean, to have this conversation, or are you just, like, you wanna give it a little more time and feel it out? I-I feel like my guard is so up just because it's been so long and it hasn't gone to that level. I mean, honestly, if he's not gonna commit, I don't think we have a future. Coming up...
