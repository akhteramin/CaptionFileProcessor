 ANNOUNCER: "SPORTSCENTER" BROUGHT TO YOU BY THE UNEXPECTED
 ENERGY OF EBIL.■
 EBAY.
 AND MICHELIN WIPER BLADES.
 THEY'RE ALL THE DIFFERENCE, FOR
 SAFER DRIVING ON THE ROAD.
 BREAKING NEWS INTO
 "SPORTSCENTER."
 ANTONIO BROWN IS A RAIDER.
 A NINE-YEAR CAREER IN PITTSBURGH
 WAS PROLIFIC.
 THE RAIDERS ARE THE TEAM THAT
 MADE THE MOST SENSE.
 IT'S GOING TO BE FOR A
 THIRD-ROUND PICK.IT GOING TO BEH
 ROUND PICK SO IT'S NOT EXACTLY A
 HUGE RETURN FOR A PLAYER THAT
 HAS HAD THE UNPARALLELED
 PRODUCTION THAT ANTONIO BROWN
 HAS HAD.
 KEVIN: ANTONIO BROWN IS IN
 OAKLAND NOW.
 HE STILL HAS PITTSBURGH ON HIS
 MIND.
 YESTERDAY HE RESPONDED TO A
 TWEET WHICH SHOWED JUJU
 SMITH-SCHUSTER AS THE STEELERS
 M.V.P.
 SAYING "EMOTION.
 BOY FUMBLED THE WHOLE POSTSEASON
 IN THE BIGGEST GAME OF THE YEAR.
 EVERYONE WENT BLIND.
 NOT ENOUGH REALITY THESE DAYS."
 JUJU RESPONDED SAYING "KEEP YOUR
 EMOTIONS OFF THE INTERNET.
 ALL I EVER DID WAS SHOW THAT MAN
 LOVE AND RESPECT FROM THE MOMENT
 HE GOT TO THE LEAGUE.
 I WAS GENUINELY HAPPY FOR HIM,
 TOO.
 CRAZY HOW BIG THAT EGO GOT TO BE
 TO TAKE SHOTS AT PEOPLE WHO SHOW
 YOU LOVE, SHAKING MY HEAD."
 THEN BROWN FIRING BACK,
 PUBLICIZING A PRIVATE MESSAGE
 JUJU SENT TO BROWN BACK WHEN HE
 WAS IN COLLEGE ASKING FOR TIPS
 TAKING HIS GAME TO THE NEXT
 LEVEL.
 EVEN LE'VEON BELL WAS TWEETING
 THIS WITH EVERYBODY REVEALING
 HIS OWN TEXT WITH JAMES CONNER,
 WITH THEM GETTING ALONG, AND
 THEY'RE HAPPY.
 KEITH: WE DON'T NEED TO GET
 FIRED FOR THAT.
 LET'S GET ON THE FIELD AND
 CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT
 THESE TWO WIDE RECEIVERS.
 WHEN YOU LOOK AT ADRIAN BELTRE
 WITH HIS NEW QUARTERBACK, DEREK
 CARR WITH THE LARDS AND JUJU
 SM■ N■■■■
 WITH BEN■OETH■■HO'S
 THIS■■■■OMING SEASON?■■■■■■■■■■H
 ANTONIO BROWN BASED ON WHAT HE
 SAID.
 THAT SOUND WITH ADAM SCHEFTER,
 UNPARALLELED SUCCESS AT THE WIDE
 RECEIVER POSITION.
 THAT'S ANTONIO BROWN.
 FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS IN A ROW,
 OVER 100 CATCHES, OVER 1200
 YARDS AND AVERAGING AT LEAST
 DOUBLE-DIGIT TOUCHDOWNS.1■■■■■■G
 THAT TIME.
 IS IT A DROP, STEP DOWN AT THE
 QUARTERBACK POSITION TO DEREK
 CARR?
 YEAH,■■■■■■■ HE IS SO GOOD.
 I HAVE TO GO WITH A.B.
 KEVIN: THE BEST TWEET IN ALL
 THIS DRAMA COMES FROM STEELERS
 DEFENSIVE END CAM HEYWARD WHO
 SAID THIS.
 "WITH ALL THIS BEEF, I'VE GOT TO
 GO VEGAN NOW."
 THAT IS A PERFECT WAY TO TIE
 THIS SEGMENT UP, AS WELL.
 WE'LL SEE HOW THIS PLAYS OUT IN
 KEITH: THIS JUST INTO
 "SPORTSCENTER," GOOD NEWS AT
 DUKE.
 NOT ABOUT ZION WILLIAMSON
 DECIDING HE'LL RETURN FOR
 ANOTHER SEASON.TRE JONES IS.
 JONES MAKING IT OFFICIAL%p TODA,
 HE'LL BE BACK FOR THE 2019-2020
 CAMPAIGN.
 ESPN HAD JONES AS A BORDERLINE
 FIRST ROUND PROSPECT IN JUNE'S
 NBA DRAFT.
 POSTPONE THAT UNTIL 2020.
 UCLA KNOW WHO IT WANTS FOR THE
 MOST LADY OR TIGER JOB IN
 COLLEGE HOOPS.
 RICK BARNES, COACH OF THE YEAR.
 UCLA HAS OFFERED $5 MILLION A
 YEAR PLUS INCENTIVES AND
 BONUSES.
 BARNES LOVES IT IN XALVE, --
 KNOXVILLE, SOURCES SAY, BUT HE
 IS DRAWN TO THE PROSP■■
 GETTING JOHN WOODEN'S OFFICE AND
 OLD JOB.
 BACK TO DICKIE V.
 I SPENT 10 YEARS WORKING IN L.A.
 AND WHAT JOB FROM WHEN GENE
 BARTOW HAD IT TO WHEN MURRAY
 BARTOW TOOK IT OVER, IT'S LIKE A
 SIREN SONG.
 NOT MANY COACHES CAN RESIST IT.
 DICKIE V.: RICK BARNES LOVES IT
 IN TENNESSEE.
 HE'S TOLD ME THAT.
 HE WAS THE NAISMITH COACH OF THE
 YEAR THIS YEAR AND DID A GREAT
 JOB.
 HOWEVER, UCLA IS ATTRACTIVE.
 NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.
 ESPECIALLY THE FACT NOW THEY'RE
 GOING TO MAKE A COMMITMENT.
 MY INSIDE SOURCES TELL ME THE
 COMMITMENT IS BIG-TIME.
 THERE WILL BE CHARTER FLIGHTS.
 ALL KINDS OF RESOURCESABLE
 THAT OTHER PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE
 AND RICK BARNES WOULD BE A GREAT
 HIRE.
 IT'S BEEN EMBARRASSING A LITTLE
 BIT WHAT'S GONE ON.
 THEY'VE BEEN USED BY SCHOOLS,
 COACHES, IN THIS WHOLE SELECTION
 PR SINCE STEVE ALFORD WHO
 THREE OUT OF FIVE YEARS HE WENT
 TO THE SWEET 16 AND IT WASN'T
 GOOD ENOUGH.
 I THINK IF THEY CAN WORK ON THE
 CONTRACT, I THINK HE'S HEADING
 TO UCLA AND THAT WOULD BE A
 GREAT, GREAT HIRE FOR THEM
 BECAUSE HE'S NEVER HAD PROBLEMS
 ANYWHERE, WITH NCAA.
 HE'S WON EVERYWHERE HE'S BEEN.
 RICK BARNES WOULD BE A BIG-TIME
 WINNER AND TAKE SOME OF THE
 EMBARRASSMENT AWAY.
 KEITH: THANK YOU, SIR.

 GONE BEFORE.
 TEXAS TECH AND VIRGINIA EACH
 LOOKING FOR THEIR FIRST NATIONAL
 CHAMPIONSHIP.
 KEVIN: WHAT A RUN SO THEDRED RAS
 NEEDED HIS OWN MEDIC TEAM
 SATURDAY NIGHT IN THE WIN OVER
 MICHIGAN STATE.
 HE IS EXPECTED TO PLAY TONIGHT
 AGAINST VIRGINIA, REMARKABLE
 CONSIDERING HOW IT LOOKED WHEN
 HE SPRAINED HIS ANKLE.
 HE ALSO TOOK A COUPLE OF SHOTS
 TO THE HEAD.
 HE DID NOT PRACTICE YESTERDAY.
 HE RANKS THIRD AMONG PLAYERS WHO
 MADE THE TOURNAMENT BEHIND
 BRANDON CLARKE AND TACKO FALL IN
 SHOTS MADE.
 SIGNIFICANT INJURY CONCERN
 FOR TEXAS TECH AS 6'10" STARTING
 FORWARD TARIQ OWENS IS DEALING
 WITHIL SPRAIN.
 ACCORDING TO HEAD COACH CHRIS
  HE SUFFERED IT IN THE
 SECOND HALF AGAINST MICHIGAN
 STATE BUT SURPRISINGLY WAS ABLE
 TO RETURN TO THE COURT.
 WEVER, WHEN HE CAME TO
 STADIUM YESTERDAY, HE WAS IN A
 WALKING BOOT AND■■OT
 PART PRACT
 BEARD TF THIS WAS A
 NORMAL TURNAROUND, HE WOULD NOT
 PLAY.
 BUT BECAUSE IT'S THE NATIONAL
 CHAMPIONSHIP GAME, HE'S
 OPTIMISTIC HE'LL BE ABLE TO GO.
 THEY WON'T KNOW FOR SURE UNTIL
 OWENS WARMS UP PREGAME.
 FOR MORE ON TONIGHT'S OPPONENT
 FOR TECH, VIRGINIA.
 HERE'S LAURA RUTLEDGE.
 LAURA: IT'S BEEN A REMARKABLE
 JOURNEY IN A YEAR'S TIME FOR
 VIRGINIA.
 FROM LOSING TO 16-SEED UMBC IN
 LAST SEASON'S FIRST ROUND TO NOW
 BEING ON THE BRINK OF A NATIONAL
 CHAMPIONSHIP.
 KYLE GUY TOOK THAT LOSS LAST
 YEAR PARTICULARLY HARD.
 BUT WANTED IT TO FUEL HIM.
 SO HE MADE A PHOTO OF HIM AFTER
 THE LOSS, HIS TWITTER AVATAR IN
 THE BACKGROUND ON HIS PHONE.
 HE WANTED IT TO BE A CONSTANT
 REMINDER TO STAY MOTIVATED.
 TONIGHT, A WIN WOULD REPLACE
 THAT MEMORY AND ALSO GIVE HIM AN
 EXCUSE TO REPLACE THAT PICTURE
 WITH WHAT HE CALLS A MUCH BETTER
 ONE.

 RIGHT NOW THEY CAN HOLD DOWN THE

 THEY'VE GOT ONE OF THE BEST

 THEY NEED SOME OF THOSE GUYS
 BACK BUT THEY'LL BE ABLE TO HOLD

 HIS VELOCITY IS STILL THERE.
 IT'S JUSTIN VERLANDER, A

 HE'LL BE JUST FINE.
 KEITH: EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT
 CHRIS DAVIS OF THE ORIOLES, JUST
 SHY OF THE RECORD FOR AT-BATS

 HE'S ALMOST HALFWAY TO 0-87 FROM

 DAVID: A GUY YOU PAID THAT MUCH
 MONEY DOES NO GOOD FOR OUR THE
 BENCH.
 PLAY OR YOU'LL LET WHETHER HE'LL
 HE'S MAK■■ MONEY WHETHER OR
 NOT HE'S PLAYING.
 HE'S A THREAT IN THE LINEUP.
 I KNOW HE'S STRUGGLING BUT IF
 YOUR ORGANIZATION HAS CONFIDENCE
 IN YOU, THAT CAN TRANSLATE INTO

 SOMETIMES THAT'S THE MOST
 IMPORTANT THING, HAVING THE

 HE'S A GUY THEY OWE A LOT OF

 HIM AND FORMER HEAD COACH MIKE
 MCCARTHY.
 LAST WEEK, MCCARTHY MADE HIS
 FIRST EXTENDED COMMENTS ABOUT
 BEING FIRED DURING THE SEASON
 LAST YEAR TO ESPN'S ROB
 DEMOVSKY.
 THEN A BLEACHER REPORT CAME OUT
 WITH ANONYMOUS SOURCES
 CRITICIZING THE RELATIONSHIP
 BETWEEN MCCARTHY AND RODGERS.
 SOME SAID RODGERS REGULARLY
 CRITICIZED MCCARTHY'S PLAY
 CALLING AND THAT THE
 RELATIONSHIP WAS A CANCER IN THE
 LOCKER ROOM AND RODGERS
 REPORTEDLY SAID MCCARTHY HAD A
 LOW FOOTBALL I.Q.
 RODGERS RESPONDED TO THE ARTICLE
 A SHORT TIME AGO ON ESPN RADIO
 MILWAUKEE.
 THIS IS NEW ON "SPORTSCENTER."
 IT'S NOT A MYSTERY.
 THIS WAS A SMEAR ATTACK BY A
 WRITER LOOKING TO ADVANCE HIS
 CAREER, TALKING WITH MOSTLY

 !÷E AN AGENDA, WHETH
 'RE ADVANCING THEIR OWN
 S OR JUST TRYING TO STIR
 OLD STUFF UP AND THEN WHAT
 HAPPENS,■ ■g SAME TIRED MEDIAFOç
 ABOUT IT WHO -THIS JUST
 EMPHASIZES THEIR OPINION ABOUT
 ME ALREADY.
 SO IT'S JUST -I
 CRAZY THING IS, THERE'S SUPER
 SLANTED OPINIONS IN THAT PIECE
 STATED AS FACT AND THEN THERE'S
 QUOTE/UNQUOTE FACTS WHICH ARE
 JUSTES.
 SO INE CASES WHERE Y■z■z
 IGNORE SOMETHING LIKE THIS OR
 GLOSS OVER IT, I DON'T THINK YOU
 CAN IN THIS CASE BECA■■ ME
 ■■d MAIN THESIS POINTS I
 WANTED TO TALK ABOUT.
 E FIRST IS THE MARK MURPHY
 CONVERSATION BECAUSE PART OF THE
 ARTICLE■■■■■■■■■■■■ SEE6■6■■■■■,
 THE PACKERS ARE■JRIED<4■ Aú■ ME
 AS THE LEADER OF THE FOOTBALL
 TEAM MOVING F■u
 I'M GOING TO SAY TWO THINGS.
 ONE,F THEY KNEW THAT, WHY
 WOULD THEY OFFER ME A CONTRACT
 LAST YEAR.
 AND TWO, WHICH GOES TO MY SECOND
 CENTRAL THESIS POINT I'M GOING
 TO TAKE DOWN, IS, IF I REALLY
 DISLIKE MIKE THAT MUCH, WHY
 WOULD I RE-SIGN KNOWING IF I
 PLAY WELL AND WE DO WHAT WE DO
 AROUND HERE, WE MADE THE
 PLAYOFFS EIGHT STRAI■ IT@■ HURT.
 IT'S GOING TO BE ME AND MIKE MY
 ENTIRE CAREER.
 IF I DISLIKED HIM THAT MUCH, DO
 YOU THINK I'D RE-SIGN?
 IS THE MONEY THAT IMPORTANT TO
 ME?
 I TELL YOU, IT'S NOT.
 KEVIN: THAT WAS MOMENTS AGO,
 AARON RODGERS ON ESPN MILWAUKEE
 RADIO.
 TIM HASSELBECK BACK WITH US.
 WHAT'S YOUR REACTION TO RODGERS
 DEFENDING HIMSELF RIGHT THERE?
 TIM: I KIND OF AM LIKE, GOOD FOR
 YOU, AARON RODGERS.
 HE ALLUDES TO IT, HE COULD
 EASILY IGNORE THIS STUFF,
 ESPECIALLY THE STUFF HE THINKS
 ARE LIES ABOUT HIS RELATIONSHI
 ■■2 MCCARTHY, BECAUSE
 TRUTHFULLY, HOWPWSWPWSWSWUATHEIR
 RELATIONSHIP IS LIKE?
 I ALSO THINK HE UNDERSTANDS THAT
 HE SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH MIKE
 MCCARTHY.
 THEY HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS
  LE WITH AILE, WHEN■
 COACH, THERE IS GOING TO BE
 PATCHES WHERE YOU DON'T AGREE
 WITH EVERYTHING THAT COACH IS
 SAYING, THAT COACH ISN'T GOING
 TO AGREE WITH THE PLAYER'S
 FEELINGS ON THINGS.
 BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU
 DON'T RESPECT THE GUY OR DOESN'T
 MEAN THAT YOU -THERE WEREN'T
 GOOD PARTS OF PLAYING FOR THAT
 COACH.
 SO, YOU KNOW, READING SOME OF
 THE STUFF I READ ABOUT MIKE
 MCCARTHY IN THE BLEACHER REPORT
 ARTICLE, I WOULD SAY THIS.
 I KNOW MIKE MCCARTHY, I KNOW
 WHAT KIND OF COACH HE IS AND HOW
 MUCH FOOTBALL HE KNOWS AND IT
 WOULD BE EASY TO FIND BITTER,
 ANGRY PLAYERS ON EVERY TEAM TO
 SAY NEGATIVE THINGS ABOUT
 PEOPLE.
 SO I THINK THE CONTEXT OF THAT
 MATTERS.
 QUITE HONESTLY, I BELIEVE A LOT
 OF WHAT AARON RODGERS IS SAYING■
 KEVIN: RODGERS IS ONE OF THOSE
 TALENTS THAT MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE
 HE SHOULD HAVE HAD MORE THAN ONE
 LOMBARDI TROPHY WITH MIKE
 MCCARTHY.
 NEW HEAD COACH FOUR YEARS OLDER
 THAN AARON RODGERS.
 WHAT'S AT STAKE FOR AARON
 RODGERS THIS SEASON AND THE
 PACKERS?
 TIM: I REMIND PEOPLE, DREW
 BREES, PRETTY GOOD, ONE SUPER
 BOWL.TO THINK THE BEST QUK IN
 THE GAME WINS THE SUPER BOWL
 EVERY YEAR, THAT'S NOT HOW IT
 S.
 WHAT'S AT STAKE IN THEY FIRED
 THEIR HEAD CAUSE THEY
 NEED THEM TO PLAY BE
 THEY WERIR TEAM IN
 WHAT'S AT STAKE IS HE NEEDS TO
 ARN A NEW OFFEN TO
 HELP BE A LEADER OF2;T TE
 HELP THEM COMPETE AGAINST THE
 BEARS WHO ARE BETTER AND THE
 VIKINGS ARE A GOOD TEAM.
 THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S AT STAKE
 BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE THE
 WAY PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT HOW GOOD
 AARON RODGERS HAS BEEN AND
 PROBABLY WILL CONTINUE TO BE.
 KEVIN: RODGERS SPEAKING OUT
 ABOUT THAT BLEACHER REPORT
 ARTICLE ABOUT THE RIFT BETWEEN
 HIM AND MIKE MCCARTHY.
 THANKS SO MUCH.
 KEITH: ONCE UPON A TIME THERE
 WAS A 25-YEAR-OLD OUTFIELDER WHO
 WON A HOME RUN TITLE ONE YEAR
 BUT IF YOU EXTRAPOLATED HOW MANY
 HOMERS HE WOULD HIT IN HIS LIFE,
 THE MATH WOULD HAVE SAID HE
 MIGHT BREAK BABE RUTH'S ALL-TIME
 RECORD SO LONG AS HE KEPT AT THE
 PACE FOR 26 SEASONS.
 THAT GUY BROKE BABE RUTH'S
 RECORD.
 IT WAS HANK AARON, IT WAS ON
 "MONDAY NIGHT BASEBALL" AND ON

 COUNTRY AND THE WORLD.
 A BLACK MAN IS GETTING A
 STANDING OVATION IN THE DEEP

 AN ALL-TIME BASEBALL IDOL.
 KEITH: AFTER THE BALL CROSSED

 THE STORY FOR 25 SECONDS.

 IF TEXAS TECH PULLS OFF THE WIN,
 THEY'LL BE THE FIRST TEAM IN

 IF TEXAS TECH CAN STOP HIM, THE

 OUR COMRADES HAV
 ESTABLISHED VIRGINIA AS A 5-1
