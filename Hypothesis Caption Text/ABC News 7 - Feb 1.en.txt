They're both durable, flexible and nice to have at parties. But Quilted Northern is not a Bouncy Castle. It's just really nice toilet paper. Do I use a toothpaste that whitens my teeth, or one that's good for my teeth? Now I don't have to choose. <i> From Crest 3D White, the</i> <i> Whitening Therapy collection</i> <i> with new Spearmint and</i> <i> Peppermint Oil.</i> <i> It gently whitens,</i> <i>plus it has a fortifying formula</i> <i>to protect your enamel.</i> <i> Crest.</i> <i>Healthy, beautiful smiles</i> <i>for life.</i> I was thrilled to be able to go with my friends to our annual get-together, especially after being diagnosed last year with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Another TRU story with KEYTRUDA. I started Katy on KEYTRUDA and chemotherapy and she's getting results we rarely saw five years ago. In a clinical trial, significantly more patients lived longer and saw their tumors shrink than on chemotherapy alone. It's changed my approach to treating patients. KEYTRUDA may be used with certain chemotherapies as your first treatment if you have advanced nonsquamous, non-small cell lung cancer and you do not have an abnormal EGFR or ALK gene. KEYTRUDA helps your immune system fight cancer, but can also cause your immune system to attack healthy parts of your body. This can happen during or after treatment and may be severe and lead to death. See your doctor right away if you have new or worse cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, diarrhea, severe stomach pain or tenderness, nausea or vomiting, rapid heartbeat, increased hunger or thirst, constipation, dizziness or fainting, changes in urine or eyesight, muscle pain or weakness, joint pain, confusion or memory problems, fever, rash, itching, or flushing. These are not all the possible side effects. Tell your doctor about all your medical conditions, including immune system problems, if you've had an organ transplant, had or plan to have a stem cell transplant, or have lung, breathing, or liver problems. Where I am now compared to a year ago, it's a story worth sharing. Living longer is possible. It's TRU. KEYTRUDA, from Merck. With more FDA-approved uses for advanced lung cancer than any other immunotherapy. Mascara in a snap. New Snapscara from Maybelline New York. Smooth, clump-free volume.
