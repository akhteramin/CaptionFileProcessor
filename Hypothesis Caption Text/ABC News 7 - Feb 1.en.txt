 WE CAN TAKE THE STAMP OFF AND LOOK HOW COOL THAT DESIGN LOOKS.
 OH.

 YEAH.
 WELL, YOURS IS ALL RIGHT.
 AND THEN WE'LL TAKE THE SUSHI.
 WE'LL JUST PLACE IT ON HOWEVER
 YOU FEEL LIKE IT.
 JUST REALLY PRETTY.
 WATCH HER, MICHAEL.
 WATCH HER.
 I KNOW YOU'RE SURPRISED I CAN
 USE THESE CHOPSTICKS, AREN'T
 YOU?
 I AM.
 MM-HMM.
 Y'ALL DON'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT
 THAT.
 A LITTLE GINGER.
 A LITTLE WASABI.
 BAM.
 YEAH.
 SEE?

 HAVE YOU EVER USED THIS ON
 GUESTS AND NOT TOLD THEM?
 KIND OF PULLING A MRS.
 DOUBTFIRE?
 BETWEEN US, YES.
 ALL THE TIME.
 LOOK AT THAT.
 NOW COME ON.
 THAT RIGHT THERE IS SOMETHING
 SPECIAL.
 IT IS SPECIAL.
 AND IT ONLY TOOK THREE
 SECONDS.
 NOW WE WANT TO MOVE RIGHT
 ALONG TO THE -THIS IS THE LO
 MEIN.
 I'M GOING TO JUMP IN HERE.
 BECAUSE WHEN I THROW DOWN, I
 FOLLOW THROUGH.
 LET'S DO THIS.
 LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT.
 LO MEIN IS GREAT TAKEOUT.
 WHO DOESN'T LOVE CHINESE FOOD,
 RIGHT?
 WHAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE A BIG
 FORK AT HOME?
 JUST USE A MINI FORK OR A
 REGULAR FORK.
 WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS TWIRL
 THE -I'M GOING TO USE A
 CARVING FORK, AND YOU CAN USE
 THAT.
 I'LL TWIRL THE NOODLES AROUND
 THE FORK.
 YOU MAY WANT TO GET TO THE
 BIG FORK.
 I'M TRYING TO WORK WITH TOOLS
 I ALREADY HAVE AT HOME.
 WE'RE GOING TO PUT IT IN THE
 CENTER OF THE PLATE.
 IT'S OKAY.
 SARA'S DOING HERS IN PORTION
 CONTROL.
 BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE EATEN AT
 A NICE RESTAURANT, THEY GIVE YOU
 A BITE ANYWAY.
 THAT'S A FIVE-STAR RESTAURANT.
 I'M GOING TO TAKE THE
 TWEEZERS AND THEN TAKE A LITTLE
 BIT OF THE VEGETABLES.
 AND I GOT TO SAY THIS.
 IF I'M COMING OVER TO YOUR HOUSE
 AS A GUEST, DON'T GO UPSTAIRS
 IN THE BATHROOM,
 AND GET THE TWEEZERS YOU HAVE
 BEEN DOING YOUR EYEBROWS WITH
 AND BRING THEM TO THE KITCHEN.
 YOU WANT CLEAN TWEEZERS.
 THAT'S DISGUSTING.
 YOU WANT A FRESH PAIR AT
 LEAST.
 EXACTLY.
 SO WE'LL DO THAT.
 WE'LL TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF THE
 VEGETABLES AND KIND OF PLACE IT
 AROUND.
 I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU.
 IF I SHOWED UP AT YOUR HOUSE,
 I'M HAPPY.
 IF I GET OVER TO YOUR HOUSE, I
 AM FRUSTRATED.
 IF YOU GO TO HER HOUSE,
 YOU'RE HUNGRY.
 FRUSTRATED, BUT SUPER SKINNY.
 SO YOU'RE WELCOME.
 SARA, PUT YOUR FINGER OVER
 THE TOP BEFORE YOU SHAKE IT UP.
 OKAY.
 HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO THAT PART.
 OKAY.
 WE'RE USING A SQUEEZE BOTTLE.
 THIS IS TERIYAKI SAUCE BECAUSE
 IT TASTES GOOD WITH THE NOODLES,
 BUT YOU CAN USE DUCK SAUCE OR
 WHATEVER YOU WANT, AND I'LL DO A
 SWIRLY DESIGN AROUND THE PLATE.
 AND YOU CAN USE -YOU CAN DO
 WHATEVER DESIGN YOU WANT BECAUSE
 IT'S ALL ABOUT CREATIVITY.
 THERE IS NO RIGHT OR WRONG HERE.
 YOU CAN DO A LITTLE BIT BETTER,
 BUT IT'S ALL GOOD.
 DON'T TELL SARA NO RIGHT OR
 WRONG.
 THAT'S WRONG.
 AND YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU
 GET RID OF THOSE BOXES AND NOT
 IN YOUR OWN TRASH.
 YOU PUT THEM IN A TRUNK OR YOU
 BURY THEM IN THE NEIGHBOR'S
 YARD.
 YOU DON'T WANT A TRAIL.
 THEY WILL FIND YOU.
 AND ANOTHER THING, YOU HAVE
 TO MAKE SURE YOU LEAVE DIRTY
 DISHES IN THE KITCHEN TOO.
 THAT'S TRUE.

  Cleaning floors with a mop and       bucket is a hassle,
    meaning you probably don't  clean as often as you'd like.
    For a quick and convenient    clean, try Swiffer WetJet.
     There's no heavy bucket,       or mop to wring out,
           because the    Absorb and Lock technology
      traps dirt and liquid         inside the pad.
                 It's safe to use        on all finished surfaces
   tile, laminate and hardwood.
   And it prevents streaks and hazing better than a micro fiber
 strip mop, giving you a thorough      clean the first time.
     For a convenient clean,
        try Swiffer WetJet   with a money back guarantee.

   Unless migraine steals your   chance  to say "I am here."
 That's why, we created Aimovig..
    A preventive treatment for       migraine in adults.
     One dose, once a month.
   Aimovig is proven to reduce         the number  of
      monthly migraine days.
 For some, that number can be cut in half or more.
   The most common side effects        are pain, redness,
   or swelling at the injection      site and constipation.
       These are your days
    What will each one bring?
         Doesn't matter,
    as long as you can say...
           "I am here."
    Talk to your doctor about       preventing migraine
          with Aimovig.        And be there more.

 YOU AREN'T JUST BIG HERE.
 YOU GUYS ARE GLOBAL,
 INTERNATIONAL, IN FACT, YOU EVEN
 DID SONGS IN OTHER LANGUAGES.
 "I'LL NEVER BREAK YOUR HEART" IN
 SPANISH.
 SI.
 AND "QUIT PLAYING GAMES WITH
 MY HEART."
 SO YOU REMEMBER ONE THING.
 DO YOU REMEMBER ANY OF THE
 LYRICS?
 DO YOU WANT TO SING IT FOR
 THEM?
 LET'S DO SPANISH.
 [ SINGING IN SPANISH ]

 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S "I'LL NEVER BREAK YOUR
 HEART" IN SPANISH.
 WE KNOW SOME ITALIAN.
 [ SINGING IN ITALIAN ]

 THAT'S "QUIT PLAYING GAMES
 WITH MY HEART."
 DO YOU KNOW THE LANGUAGE
 WELL?
 YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE
 THAT DOESN'T DO LANGUAGES WELL,
 AND YOU'RE, LIKE, THAT'S NOT HOW
 YOU SAY IT?
 DID ANYONE STRUGGLE WITH THE
 LANGUAGES?
 OH YEAH.
 SOMETIMES.
 WE RECORDED -I WAS GOING TO
 SAY THIS.
 THERE WAS A NEW SONG WE WERE
 GOING TO RECORD IN SPANISH AND
 I'LL NEVER FORGET.
 IT WAS HARD.
 IT WAS ON THE NEW RECORD
 ACTUALLY A SONG IN JAPAN.
 DIDN'T GET RELEASED HERE I DON'T
 THINK, AND IT WAS REALLY
 DIFFICULT, AND I JUST REMEMBER
 THEM BEING, LIKE, SHAKING THEIR
 HEADS IN THE BOOTH.
 IT WAS ACTUALLY HARD FOR ME.
 SOMETIMES WE CAN'T SPEAK
 ENGLISH.
 IT WAS HARD FOR ME AND I'M
 HALF PUERTO RICAN.
 IT WAS HARD FOR ME.
 I ALSO HEARD THE SONG "I WANT
 IT THAT WAY," WHICH IS ONE OF
 YOUR BIGGEST HITS.
 OH YEAH.
 YOU GUYS -THE PRODUCERS
 WANTED TO YOU RECORD IT -OR
 CHANGE THE LYRICS BECAUSE IT
 WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE?
 THE LABEL.
 THE WRITER AND PRODUCER LOVED IT
 AND WE LOVED IT AND THEN THE
 LABEL HEARD IT AND THEY WERE,
 LIKE, THIS -WE DON'T
 UNDERSTAND THE SONG.
 SO WE RE-WROTE THE LYRICS.
 WHERE THE SONG ACTUALLY TOLD A
 STORY, TOLD A NARRATIVE AND MADE
 SENSE, BUT IT JUST DIDN'T SOUND
 AS GOOD.
 SO WE WENT BACK TO THE ORIGINAL
 VERSION.
 IT MAKES NO SENSE AND
 EVERYONE LOVES IT.
 IT BASICALLY WENT TO --
 ♪ NO GOOD-BYES, NO MORE LIES ♪
 ♪ I LOVE IT WHEN I HEAR YOU SAY
 I WANT IT THAT WAY ♪
 NO ONE NEEDS TO KNOW WHAT
 THAT WAY IS.
 IT'S AN OPEN INTERPRETATION.
 JUST LIKE MEATLOAF.
 I WOULD DO ANYTHING.
 WHAT WOULD YOU DO?
 LET THEM THINK.
 IT'S SUPER PHILOSOPHICAL.
 ♪ I WON'T DO THAT ♪
 TELL ME WHAT THAT IS.
 TELL ME WHAT'S THAT.
 THERE IS THAT ONE THING.
 THE ONE THING.
 HE WON'T RIDE A MOTORCYCLE.
 KEEPS YOU GUESSING.
 WE WERE SAYING YOU WERE
 CLOSING UP YOUR RESIDENCY IN LAS

 IT'S GONE TWO YEARS.
 FEBRUARY AND APRIL ARE OUR LAST
 RUNS, AND I ACTUALLY MOVED THERE
 AND SO I'M RAISING MY FAMILY IN
 LAS VEGAS, AND THAT'S -IT'S
 BEEN INCREDIBLE FOR US.
 IT'S GIVEN US AN OPPORTUNITY TO
 BE THE BEST BACKSTREET BOYS WE

 BACHELORETTE PARTIES AND IT'S
 INCREDIBLE, BUT NOW WE'RE

 BROODING WALK.
 YOU HAVE A MOVE.
 YEP.

 THE POWER WALK.
 YOU KNOW WHAT'S FUNNY, THAT
 PARTICULAR SHOT WAS NOT
 ORIGINALLY SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE

 FIRST TIME STEPPING BEHIND THE

 ABOUT THAT POWERFUL --
 BOY BAND WALK?
 BOY BAND WALK.
 THE CAMERA'S GOT TO BE DOWN
 HERE, RIGHT?
 ARE YOU WALKING AT REGULAR
 PACE?
 THAT'S WHAT I HAVE TO SAY.
 A LOT OF TIMES THEY SPEED UP THE
 MUSIC AND WE HAVE TO WALK EXTRA
 FAST AND THEN THEY SLOW IT DOWN
 AND IT LOOKS EPIC.
 AS YOU SAID, THIS IS A
 PATENTED WALK.
 WE DID A ROUNDUP OF WHERE WE
 MIGHT HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE.
 THERE YOU GO.

 A FUN THING ABOUT SHOOTING
 THOSE WALKS IS WHAT NICK WAS
 SAYING.
 THEY ACTUALLY SPEED UP THE
 MUSIC, OKAY?
 SO YOU'RE WALKING SO IT LOOKS
 LIKE YOU'RE WALKING IN SLOW

 YOU'RE SINGING IN TIME WITH THE
 MUSIC.
 SO IT'S ACTUALLY WHEN YOU ARE
 WALKING INSTEAD OF, LIKE --

 IT'S NOT IN REALTIME.
 DO IT.
 IT'S, LIKE --
 ♪ WHAT ARE THE CHANCES ♪

 YOU FEEL KIND OF LIKE A
 CHIPMUNK, BUT IT'S FUNNY.
 I'LL NEVER LOOK AT THAT WALK
 THE SAME AGAIN.
 YOU HAVE TO KEEP THAT POWER
 FACE, YOU KNOW?
 SINCE YOU GUYS ARE HERE, WE
 HAPPEN TO HAVE A CAMERA THAT'S
 DOWN LOW, AND -CAN WE DO A
 LITTLE POWER WALK?
 YEAH.

 I was thrilled to be able to go with my friends to our annual
  get-together, especially after  being diagnosed last year
   with advanced non-small cell   lung cancer.
 Another TRU story with KEYTRUDA.
  I started Katy on KEYTRUDA and  chemotherapy and she's getting
       results we rarely       saw five years ago.
   In a clinical trial,   significantly more patients
    lived longer and saw their    tumors shrink than
      on chemotherapy alone.
   It's changed my approach to   treating patients.
    KEYTRUDA may be used with    certain chemotherapies as
 your first treatment if you have advanced nonsquamous, non-small
 cell lung cancer and you do not have an abnormal
      "EGFR" or "ALK" gene.
    KEYTRUDA helps your immune    system fight cancer,
  but can also cause your immune  system to attack healthy
 parts of your body. This can happen during or after treatment
       and may be severe       and lead to death.
  See your doctor right away if  you have new or worse cough,
 chest pain, shortness of breath, diarrhea, severe stomach pain
    or tenderness, nausea or    vomiting, rapid heartbeat,
   increased hunger or thirst,   constipation, dizziness
     or fainting, changes in     urine or eyesight,
      muscle pain or      weakness, joint pain,
  confusion or memory problems,  fever, rash,
      itching, or flushing.
      These are not all the      possible side effects.
 Tell your doctor about all your medical conditions,
     including immune system     problems, if you've had
 an organ transplant, had or plan to have a stem cell transplant,
   or have lung, breathing, or   liver problems.
   Where I am now compared to a   year ago,
   it's a story worth sharing.
    Living longer is possible.
            It's TRU.

  Okay, I never thought I'd say  this,
     but I found bladder leak     underwear
     that's actually pretty.
            Surprised?
   It's called Always Discreet   Boutique.
    It looks and fits like my    underwear.
   I know what you're thinking.
  How can something this pretty  protect?
     Hidden inside is a super     absorbent core
 that quickly turns liquid to gel
    for incredible protection.
