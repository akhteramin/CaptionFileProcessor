 STORIES OF SURVIVING DEATH. IT WAS MAGNIFICENT AND
 FRIGHTENING AT THE SAME TIME.
 VIVID DETAILS OF WHAT THEY
 SAW.
 THIS BEAUTIFUL GARDEN.
 THIS RIVER OF LIGHT.
 AND A MEDIUM THAT UNRAVELS
 THE ANSWERS THEY NEED TO HEAR.
 DR. OZ: WHY DO YOU THINK YOU
 WERE SENT BACK?
 PLUS, FILTHY FEBRUARY.
 YOU WON'T BELIEVE HOW DIRTY
 THESE EVERYDAY ITEMS ARE.
 DR. OZ: 10 TIMES MORE GERMS THAN
 YOUR TOILET.
 COMING UP NEXT.

 DR. OZ: SEASON 10 STARTS NOW.
 TODAY, PEOPLE WHO SURVIVED DEATH
 AND SAY THEY CROSSED OVER TO THE
 OTHER SIDE, TO A PLACE WHERE FEW
 HAVE GONE, WHERE SCIENCE HAS YET
 TO EXPLAIN.
 TWO STORIES, ONE THAT COULD
 HAPPEN TO ANY OF US, A NEAR
 FATAL CAR ACCIDENT, AND ANOTHER
 THAT DEFIES THE ODDS, BEING
 STRUCK BY LIGHTNING.
 TWO SURVIVORS HAVE COME TODAY TO
 GET ANSWERS ABOUT WHERE THEY
 WENT, WHAT THEY SAW, AND WHY
 THEY WERE SENT BACK TO SHARE
 THEIR STORY.
 THEY'VE ASKED FOR THE HELP OF AN
 UNLIKELY SOURCE.
 TRICIA SAYS THE DAY SHE ALMOST
 DIED STARTED OFF LIKE ANY OTHER
 NORMAL DAY.
 TRICIA: IT WAS A NORMAL DAY.
 I WAS DRIVING TO THE AUSTIN 10K,
 WHEN OUT OF NOWHERE A CAR WAS
 BARRELING TOWARDS ME AND I HAD
 PRETTY MUCH A HEAD ON COLLISION.
 I WAS RUSHED TO THE HOSPITAL.
 I HAD BROKEN MY NECK AND WAS
 GOING TO NEED EMERGENCY SPINAL
 SURGERY.
 I HAD LOST FEELING IN ONE OF MY
 LEGS.
 I WENT INTO SURGERY AND THE NEXT
 THING I KNEW I WAS OUTSIDE OF MY
 BODY.
 THE MONITOR FLATLINED.
 I WAS DEAD.
 IT WAS LIKE, OH MY GOD.
 I DID NOT WANT TO BE IN THAT
 ROOM ANYMORE, SO I LEFT.
 EVENTUALLY I TRANSITIONED INTO A
 DIFFERENT ROOM.
 I BELIEVED THIS ROOM TO BE THE
 BEGINNING OF HEAVEN.
 DR. OZ: TRICIA JOINS ME NOW.
 YOU DESCRIBED A SOUND NO ONE
 WANTS TO HEAR, A FLATLINE, IN
 THIS CASE YOURS.
 HOW LONG DID YOUR HEART STOP
 BEATING?
 TRICIA: TWO AND A HALF MINUTES.
 DR. OZ: I GATHER YOU HAD AN OUT
 OF BODY EXPERIENCE.
 WHAT DID YOU THINK WAS
 HAPPENING?
 TRICIA: I WAS AT PEACE.
 I WAS FINE WITH THIS.
 I WAS AGNOSTIC AT THE TIME.
 I WAS SO EXCITED THAT WE GO ON.
 MY SOUL CONTINUES ON, THERE'S
 THIS CONSCIOUSNESS THAT
 TRANSCENDS THIS PHYSICAL FORM.
 DR. OZ: IT IS NICE TO KNOW IT
 DOESN'T ALL END WHEN IT IS OVER.
 THE RESEARCH REVEALS THAT PEOPLE
 SOMETIMES SEE SPIRITS ON THE
 OTHER SIDE, SOMETIMES DON'T.
 DO YOU SEE ANYONE ELSE?
 TRICIA: YES, I SAW THESE AMAZING
 ANGELS.
 I SAW THESE NINE FOOT BEINGS
 THAT WERE INCREDIBLY
 INTELLIGENT.
 THEY WERE SENDING HEALING LIGHT
 INTO MY BODY.
 DR. OZ: DO YOU THEN END UP IN
 HEAVEN?
 WERE YOU ABLE TO SPEAK WITH GOD?
 TRICIA: AFTER THAT MOMENT WHEN
 THE MONITOR FLATLINED, I
 TRANSITIONED INTO THIS PLACE
 NEAR GOD WHERE I WAS GIVEN A LOT
 OF INFORMATION AT A VERY QUICK
 SPEED.
 IT WAS FANTASTIC.
 DR. OZ: WHAT KINDS OF
 INFORMATION?
 TRICIA: I WAS SHOWN DIFFERENT
 THINGS ABOUT MY LIFE.
 I HAD THE LIFE REVIEW THAT MANY
 PEOPLE HAVE.
 I SAW THAT EYE WAS NOT ALWAYS
 KIND TO PEOPLE.
 I WAS SHOWN THAT THEY HAD GOOD
 HEARTS AND I NEEDED TO LOOK INTO
 THE HEARTS OF PEOPLE TO SEE WHO
 THEY ARE, NOT TO JUDGE THEM
 MATERIALLY.
 I LEARNED A WHOLE LOT MORE.
 I TRANSITIONED INTO A HEAVENLY
 LANDSCAPE.
 DR. OZ: WERE YOU THE SAME AGE IN
 HEAVEN AS YOU WERE ON THAT
 OPERATING TABLE?
 TRICIA: GOD TOLD ME TO BE LIKE A
 LITTLE CHILD.
 THAT SPIRIT BODY, I TRANSITIONED
 WHEN I ENTERED HEAVEN AS A CHILD
 OF FIVE YEARS OLD.
 CHILDREN ARE VERY MUCH ALIVE,
 YOU KNOW.
 SO I FELT THAT WAY.
 DR. OZ: WHO WAS THE LAST PERSON
 YOU SAW IN HEAVEN?
 TRICIA: MY GRANDFATHER WAS THERE
 TO GREET ME AND HE ESCORTED ME
 INTO HEAVEN.
 DR. OZ: DID YOU SPEAK WITH HIM?
 DID HE ASK ANY QUESTIONS?
 TRICIA: HE JUST GAVE ME LOVE AND
 PEACE AND COMFORT AND SAID,
 WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO ON?
 THE ADVENTUROUS SOUL THAT I AM,
 I WAS LIKE, YES.
 I STARTED FLYING TO THAT AMAZING
 , BEAUTIFUL, PEACEFUL LOVE OF
 GOD AND I NEVER FELT BETTER.
 THERE IS NO EXPERIENCE LIKE IT.
 THERE IS NO DRUG.
 THERE IS NO LOVE.
 THERE IS NOTHING ON EARTH LIKE
 THAT.
 DR. OZ: WHY DO YOU THINK YOU
 WERE CHOSEN TO CROSS OVER AND
 THEN BE SENT BACK?
 TRICIA: GOD STOPPED ME.
 I DID NOT WANT TO COME BACK.
 I INSISTED THAT I STAY AND GOD
 SAID NO, YOU MUST RETURN.
 DR. OZ: I STILL HAVE QUESTIONS.
 I KNOW YOU DO AS WELL.
 SHE ASKED US TO CONNECT HER WITH
 SOMEONE WHO MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO
 JUST EXPLAIN DEATH
 SCIENTIFICALLY, BUT MORE
 IMPORTANTLY, OFFER A SPIRITUAL
 POINT OF VIEW.
 I WANT TO BRING IN ANNA
 RAIMONDI.
 THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: I CAN THROW OUT IDEAS
 ABOUT WHY WHEN YOUR BLOOD
 PRESSURE DROPS, AND THEY WERE
 OPERATING ON YOU, LOSING A LOT
 OF BLOOD, AS A SCIENTIST I
 UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT I'M TRYING
 TO UNDERSTAND WHAT REALLY
 HAPPENS WHEN WE DIE FROM A
 SPIRITUAL PERSPECTIVE.
 ANNA: WHEN WE FIRST PASS, WE
 HANG AROUND THOSE WHO ARE
 GRIEVING, BECAUSE WE WANT TO
 HELP THEM AS WELL.
 WHEN SOMEONE FIRST PASSES, THEY
 ARE AROUND FOR ABOUT FOUR TO SIX
 WEEKS, HELPING.
 THEN WE TRANSITION.
 WE SEE SOMEONE THAT WE KNOW TO
 GIVE US COMFORT.
 THERE IS STILL FEAR AROUND THE
 TRANSITION.
 ONCE WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE CAN
 MOVE ON AND THAT WE ARE GOING TO
 A PLACE WHERE WE WILL BE LOVED,
 WE MOVE ON.
 DR. OZ: WHERE DO WE GO WHEN WE
 DIE?
 TRICIA TOLD US ABOUT HEAVEN AS
 SHE SIGHED.
 SHE'S BEEN FAIRLY DETAILED ABOUT
 WHAT HEAVEN FELT LIKE FOR HER.
 ANNA: WE GO TO A PLACE THAT IS
 RIGHT HERE.
 THE DIMENSION IS RIGHT HERE.
 WE ARE NOT UP IN THE SKY.
 IT IS A BEAUTIFUL WAY TO THINK
 ABOUT HEAVEN, BUT IT TRULY IS
 RIGHT HERE.
 WE GO TO THIS PLACE THAT IS PURE
 LOVE.
 DR. OZ: WE DON'T PHYSICALLY MOVE
 FROM OUR BODY?
 ANNA: WE DO.
 THE SOUL LEAVES INTO THIS OTHER
 DIMENSION.
 THE BODY STAYS IN THE MATERIAL
 WORLD, BUT THE SOUL MOVES INTO
 THIS OTHER DIMENSION.
 DR. OZ: WHICH IS ALL AROUND US.
 ANNA: ALL THE TIME.
 IF YOU MOVE OUT OF FEAR, YOU CAN
 CONNECT TO YOUR LOVED ONES.
 DR. OZ: WHEN WE COME BACK,
 TRICIA IS GOING TO ASK FOR THE
 ANSWERS SHE CAME TO FIND OUT.
 SPECIFICALLY, A QUESTION THAT
 YOU'VE THE DAY YOU SAW
 YOUR GRANDFATHER.
 STAY WITH US.
 [APPLAUSE]

 GROCERY STORE STATE, SO MUCH TO CHOOSE FROM.
 WE ARE GOING BEHIND THE BUTCHERS
 COUNTER.
 ARE YOU GETTING THE BIGGEST BANG
 FOR YOUR BUCK?
 PLUS --
 WHAT DO YOU FEEL?
 ARE YOU ADDICTED TO EXTREME
 ONLINE SHOPPING?
 WE WILL REVEAL THE WARNING
 SIGNS.
 IT IS AFFECTING THE BRAIN THE
 WAY DRUGS DO.

   Well, here's to first dates!
        You look amazing.
      And you look amazingly      comfortable.
   <i> When your V-Neck looks more</i>   <i> like a U-Neck...</i>
    <i> That's when you know, it's</i>    <i> Half-Washed.</i>
  <i> Try Downy Fabric Conditioner.</i>
  <i> Unlike detergent alone, Downy</i>  <i> helps prevent stretching</i>
  <i> by conditioning and smoothing</i>  <i> fibers,</i>
  <i> so clothes look newer, longer.</i>
       <i> Downy and it's done.</i>
     I know it's hard Maddie.
          But I promise,      it's gonna get better.

 [APPLAUSE] DR. OZ: WE ARE BACK
 INVESTIGATING, CAN LIFE AFTER
 DEATH SURVIVORS GET ANSWERS FROM
 THE OTHER SIDE?
 TRISTA SAYS SHE FLATLINED FOR
 TWO AND A HALF MINUTES WHILE
 DOCTORS RUSHED TO SAVE HER LIFE.
 SHE ASKED US TO CONNECT HER WITH
 GRIEF COUNSELOR AND MEDIUM ANNA
 RAIMONDI TO HELP MAKE SENSE OF
 WHAT SCIENCE AND MEDICINE CANNOT
 EXPLAIN.
 THE ONE BIG QUESTION YOU'VE BEEN
 WONDERING ABOUT SINCE YOU
 SURVIVE?
 TRICIA: WHEN GOD SHOWED ME THAT
 RIVER OF LIGHT, I INTERPRETED
 THESE LIGHTS AS SOULS THAT
 NEEDED TO BE REMINDED OF GOD AND
 THEIR PURPOSE AND THEIR LOVE.
 I SAW THEM AS STUDENTS.
 NOW THAT MY LIFE IS EVOLVING,
 ARE THESE PEOPLE THAT I'M GOING
 TO REACH THROUGH SPEAKING HERE?
 ANNA: I DON'T THINK THEY ARE
 JUST STUDENTS, BUT EVERYBODY IS
 A STUDENT.
 YOU ARE TEACHING THE MASSES
 ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE.
 THIS IS WAY BIGGER THAN JUST THE
 PEOPLE YOU TEACH IN A CLASSROOM.
 AND YOU WILL HELP THEM.
 AND YOU HAVE BEEN HELPING THEM.
 TRICIA: IS IT CONNECTED TO
 PARTICULAR PAINS IN THEIR LIFE
 THEY NEED TO OVERCOME?
 ANNA: ALWAYS.
 WE ALL GO THROUGH LIFE SEEKING
 TO HEAL.
 WITH EACH ONE, YOU WILL TOUCH
 SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
 DR. OZ: CAN YOU HELP ME
 UNDERSTAND WHY TRICIA SAW HER
 GRANDFATHER?
 I'M ALWAYS AMAZED.
 I'VE MET MANY ON THE SHOW OR
 JUST TRAVELING AROUND, THEY SEEM
 TO ALWAYS MEET PEOPLE.
 WHY WOULD TRICIA MEET HER
 GRANDFATHER?
 ANNA: BECAUSE SHE FELT SAFE WITH
 HIM.
 SHE FELT COMFORT WITH HIM.
 HE WAS ABLE TO EXPRESS THAT LOVE
 WHEN MAYBE SHE WASN'T GETTING IT
 FROM OTHER PEOPLE IN HER LIFE.
 HE CAME TO SAY, I LOVE YOU, I'VE
 GOT YOU.
 DR. OZ: HOW DOES THAT FEEL?
 TRICIA: IT FEELS AMAZING.
 HE DID LOVE ME AND I DIDN'T FEEL
 THAT FOR MOST OF MY FAMILY.
 I CERTAINLY FELT THAT
 UNCONDITIONAL LOVE AND LACK OF
 JUDGMENT.
 I DID FEEL INCREDIBLY PEACEFUL
 WITH HIM.
 DR. OZ: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
 WHEN WE COME BACK, A WOMAN WHO
 SURVIVED BEING STRUCK BY
 LIGHTNING AND EXPERIENCED A
 VERSION OF HEAVEN YOU'VE NEVER
 HEARD BEFORE.
 SHE ISOME
 ANSWERS.

 IT WAS A HOT SUMMER DAY. I WAS ON MY PORCH, TALKING ON MY
 CORDLESS PHONE.
 IT STARTED TO RAIN, BUT I WAS
 COVERED SO I WASN'T GETTING WET.
 I HEARD SOME THUNDER RUMBLING IN
 THE DISTANCE, THEN I HEARD A
 LOUD CRACK.
 THE LIGHTNING CAME AND HIT MY
 RIGHT ARM.
 I FELT THIS HORRIBLE PAIN.
 AND THEN MY SPIRIT JUST PEELED
 OUT OF MY BODY.
 AND WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT WAS
 BOTH MAGNIFICENT AND FRIGHTENING
 AT THE SAME TIME.
 DR. OZ: BEING STRUCK BY
 LIGHTNING, A NEAR-DEATH
 EXPERIENCE YOU DON'T HEAR ABOUT
 OFTEN.
 SHARON IS HERE WITH HOW SHE
 ALMOST DIED AND WHAT SHE SAYS
 SHE SAW.
 BEFORE WE GET TO WHAT YOU SAW
 WHEN YOU CROSSED OVER, WHAT DOES
 IT FEEL LIKE TO BE STRUCK BY
 LIGHTNING?
 SHARON: IT IS A HORRIBLE PAIN.
 BURNING, SEARING, HORRIFIC, JUST
 A HORRIFIC PAIN.
 DR. OZ: SO YOU REMEMBER THE PAIN
 AND THE LIGHTNING DAMAGED YOUR
 HEART, SO YOU COLLAPSED.
 WHAT DID YOU SEE WHEN YOU
 CROSSED OVER?
 SHARON: MY SPIRIT JUST PEELED
 OUT OF MY BODY AND I WENT INTO
 MY HOUSE AND IT WAS MY HOUSE,
 BUT NOTHING IN MY HOUSE WAS MY
 STUFF, AND I HEARD OLD-TIME
 RADIO PLAYING AND IT SOUNDED
 LIKE SOMETHING LIKE WHAT YOU
 WOULD HEAR ON THE WALTONS.
 DR. OZ: LIKE A HUNDRED YEARS
 AGO, 80 YEARS AGO.
 SHARON: LIKE BACK IN THE 1920'S
 OR 1930'S.
 AFTER THE LIGHTNING HIT MY ARM,
 IT TRAVELED UNDER THE HOUSE AND
 BLUE THE TRANSFORMER IN FRONT OF
 THE HOUSE, SO WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY
 POWER.
 DR. OZ: SO THERE COULDN'T HAVE
 BEEN ANY MUSIC IN THE HOUSE.
 SHARON: NO, WE WERE WITHOUT
 POWER.
 I KNEW THAT I HAD BEEN STRUCK BY
 LIGHTNING, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW I
 WAS DEAD YET, SO I WAS REALLY
 CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING
 ON.
 APPARENTLY I WAS A GHOST.
 DR. OZ: DID YOU TRANSITION FROM
 THIS OLDER VERSION OF YOUR HOUSE
 WITHOUT YOUR STUFF IN IT TO
 HEAVEN?
 YOUR EXPERIENCE IS DIFFERENT
 FROM WHAT I HEAR FROM MANY WHO
 HAVE CROSSED OVER.
 SHARON: AFTER ABOUT TWO OR THREE
 MINUTES OF THIS PERIOD OF --
 THIS WEIRD PERIOD, THERE WAS
 THIS PRESENCE THAT APPEARED.
 IT WAS A HUGE LOVING PRESENCE
 AND IT JUST FILLED ME FOR LOVE
 THIS UNBELIEVABLE LOVE LIKE I'VE
 NEVER EXPERIENCED IN MY LIFE.
 I WENT FROM BEING IN THIS HOUSE
 THAT I KNEW WAS MY HOUSE AND
 DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING IN IT THAT
 BELONGED TO ME, TO GOING INTO
 THESE BEAUTIFUL CLOUDS.
 I DIDN'T GO UP OR DOWN.
 I WENT SIDEWAYS.
 WE MOVED VERY QUICKLY THROUGH
 THESE PINK AND GOLD CLOUDS.
 AT THE END, I WAS IN THIS
 BEAUTIFUL GARDEN.
 IT WAS THE MOST MAGNIFICENT
 GARDEN I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY
 LIFE.
 THE COLORS WERE SO RICH AND
 VIBRANT.
 THE PINKS WERE PINKER AND THE
 REDS WERE REDDER.
 DR. OZ: AND YOU SAW PEOPLE
 THERE.
 SHARON: YES.
 WHEN I FIRST GOT INTO THE
 GARDEN, THESE TW YOUNG MEN
 GREETED ME.
 AT FIRST I THOUGHT THEY WERE
 ANGELS, BUT THEN IT HIT ME, THEY
 WERE MY BROTHERS WHO HAD DIED AS
 BABIES.
 THEY WERE FULLY GROWN AND THEY
 LOOKED JUST LIKE MY DAD.
 I HAD MY LIFE REVIEW AND IT WAS
 LIKE WATCHING AN OLD-FASHIONED
 MOVIE.
 IT WAS EVERYTHING FROM THE TIME
 I WAS BORN UNTIL THE TIME I
 DIED.
 DR. OZ: WHY DIDN'T YOU STAY
 THERE?
 SHARON: I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE A
 CHOICE.
 I HAD TO COME BACK.
 I DON'T KNOW WHY.
 DR. OZ: LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT.
 SHARON SAYS SHE HAS LINGERING
 QUESTIONS.
 LET ME BRING BACK ANNA RAIMONDI.
 THIS STORY, ELEMENTS ARE
 RECURRENT, ELEMENTS ARE
 DIFFERENT.
 HOW DO YOU MAKE SENSE OF IT?
 I'M CURIOUS ABOUT WHY SHE WAS
 SENT BACK.
 ANNA: SHE WAS SENT BACK FOR THE
 SAME REASON, TO TELL HER STORY.
 IT MAY NOT BE STANDING AT A
 PODIUM.
 IT MAY BE IN COMMUNITY.
 ARE YOU VERY RELIGIOUS?
 BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE IT ALSO
 MOVES THROUGH RELIGION.
 WHO IS KATHLEEN, CATHERINE, AND
 MARY?
 SHARON: MY MOTHER.
 ANNA: IS YOUR GRANDMOTHER
 CATHERINE?
 I KNOW THESE ARE SEPARATE
 PEOPLE.
 THEY ARE VERY MUCH AROUND YOU ON
 YOUR JOURNEY.
 AND ALSO TRYING TO HEAL YOU.
 THEY ARE VERY MUCH AROUND A
 LITTLE BOY.
 DO YOU HAVE A SON OR A GRANDSON?
 SHARON: GRANDSON.
 ANNA: HIS NAME BEGINS WITH A C O
 R --
 SHARON: CONNOR.
 ANNA: THEY ARE VERY MUCH AROUND
 HIM.
 THEY ARE TRYING TO GIVE HIM
 CLARITY, TRYING TO MAKE YOU SEE
 THINGS MORE CLEARLY AS WELL.
 HER EXPERIENCE WAS A LITTLE BIT
 DIFFERENT, BUT I ALSO FEEL LIKE
 IT IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF FROM
 A.
 WHO IS GARY?
 SHARON: MY DAD.
 ANNA: HE IS LIVING?
 SHARON: YES.
 ANNA: THEY ARE SAYING, I LOVE
 HIM.
 DOES HE LIVED CLOSE TO YOU?
 IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU STAY
 AROUND HIM.
 HE'S STILL GRIEVING.
 HE'S OK, THOUGH.
 DR. OZ: I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO
 UNDERSTAND HOW YOU KNOW THIS.
 WE DON'T FEED INFORMATION TO
 YOU.
 BUT I KNOW THAT YOU'VE TALKED TO
 MANY AND THEY ALL FEEL THE SAME
 SENSE OF AWE THAT I HAVE.
 SHARON, AS YOU TRY TO MAKE SENSE
 OF WHY THIS HAPPENED TO YOU, HOW
 DOES IT AFFECT YOU?
 SHARON: I AGREE WITH WHAT SHE'S
 SAYING.
 I PROMISED GOD WHEN I WAS A
 LITTLE GIRL THAT I WOULD TAKE
 CARE OF MY PARENTS IN THEIR
 OLDER YEARS.
 I WAS A CAREGIVER FOR MY MOTHER
 FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS OF HER
 LIFE.
 SHE HAD ALZHEIMER'S.
 I TOOK CARE OF HER WHEN SHE DIED
 AND I TOOK CARE OF MY DAD FOR A
 WHILE AFTER HER DEATH.
 HE'S DOING VERY WELL.
 HE'S VERY HAPPY NOW.
 DR. OZ: YOUR TASK IS TO KEEP
 DOING THAT.
 ANNA: I SEE YOUR MOTHER IN A
 CHURCH, BY THE WAY.
 SHARON: SHE PASSED AWAY.
 ANNA: SHE'S PRAYING.
 ARE THEY CATHOLIC?
 IT LOOKS LIKE A CATHOLIC CHURCH
 AND SHE'S LIGHTING CANDLES.
 SHE WANTS YOU TO NEVER BE
 AFRAID.
 DR. OZ: GOOD ADVICE GOING
 FORWARD.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: YOU CAN HEAR LOTS MORE
 WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
 [APPLAUSE]

 DR. OZ: I LOVE GETTING TO TALK WITH YOU ON MY SHOW EVERY DAY,
 BUT WHEN THE CAMERAS STOP
 ROLLING, THE CONVERSATION IS NOT
 OVER.
 I STILL HAVE A LOT I WANT TO

 TALK ABOUT.
  Do you push through migraine?
     Mom, are you OK to play?
 Yeah honey, how about we play...
      princess and pirates?
   Imagine what you can do with   more migraine-free days.
             Arr!
            En garde!
     When you're not fighting     through migraine
    imagine the possibilities.
  Once-monthly Emgality is used  for the prevention
      of migraine in adults.
  It's specifically developed to  help give you
     more migraine-free days.
  With Emgality about 60% of  people had their migraine days
       cut in half or more.
 Do not use if you are allergic to Emgality or its ingredients.
   Emgality may cause allergic   reactions, such as
     itching, rash, hives and     trouble breathing,
 which can happen days after use.
 Call your doctor or get medical help right away
    if you have symptoms of an    allergic reaction.
       The most common side       effects include
    injection site reactions.
   What should we do tomorrow?
 Ask your doctor about Emgality.

           Right, kids?              -Kids?
           -Papa, Papa!            -[ Laughs ]
        -You didn't tell me     your friends were coming.
            -Oh, yeah.
  -This one is tiny like a child.
          -Yeah, she is.
        Oh, but seriously,    it's good to be surrounded
      by what matters most --
      a home and auto bundle         from Progressive.
           -Oh, sweetie,       please, play for us.
       -Oh, no, I couldn't.
             -Please.              -Okay.

             -Please.              -Okay.
 APPLE PODCAST OR WHEREVER YOU GET YOUR PODCAST.

 POLICE OFFICER HERE. I'M GOING TO GRAB A OF GENES SO
 YOU CAN TEST THEM.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: IT IS FILTHY FEBRUARY.
 IT IS NOT JUST ME.
 WE ASKED OUR WHOLE AUDIENCE TO
 BRING IN THEIR GENES -- JEANS SO
 WE CAN DO A GERM TEST.
 THERE'S A LOT.
 SOME OF THEM ARE CLEAN.
 SOME NOT SO MUCH.
 WE DECIDED TO SEE JUST HOW
 FILTHY THEY ARE.
 THAT WAS THE PURPOSE HERE.
 TO FIND THE ANSWER TO THE BIG
 QUESTION, HOW OFTEN SHOULD YOU
 BE WASHING THESE JEANS?
 THE RESULTS ARE COMING UP AND
 TWO PEOPLE IN OUR AUDIENCE STOOD
 OUT, THE CLEANEST AND THE
 DIRTIEST.
 WHO ARE YOU?
 SEE 58, COME DOWN.
 72, COME DOWN.
 LET'S SEE YOU.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: HOW ARE YOU?
 WHAT IS YOUR NAME?
 ADRIENNE AND BETHANY.
 ARE YOU NERVOUS?
 A LITTLE.
 DR. OZ: LET ME SEE YOUR GENES.
 CAN I TELL THE DIFFERENCE?
 A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM EACH
 OTHER.
 SOMEONE HAS TO GO FIRST.
 WHO THINKS THEY ARE THE DIRTY
 ONE?
 THAT WASN'T HARD.
 [LAUGHTER]
 IT WASN'T AT ALL.
 DR. OZ: YOUR FIRST NAME IS
 BETHANY, RIGHT, AND YOU THINK
 YOU ARE PRETTY CLEAN?
 I'M GOING TO GO FIRST.
 EVERYONE ELSE IS VERY RELIEVED
 THEY ARE NOT UP HERE.
 MY JEANS SCORED 320.
 REMEMBER, A NUMBER THAT IS A
 LOT LESS THAN THAT, ONE HAD A
 SCORE OF 35.
 ONE OF YOU HAD A SUPER DIRTY

 THAT PAIR BELONGED TO ADRIENNE.
 YOU WERE RIGHT.
 [APPLAUSE]
 THAT IS WHAT I THOUGHT.
 DR. OZ: WHAT IS GOING ON WITH
 THESE GENES -- JEANS?
 IN MY DEFENSE, I'M GOING TO
 PLEAD MY CASE RIGHT NOW, I WORK
 FROM HOME.
 I DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE VERY
 OFTEN.
 WHEN I THROW MY JEANS ON, EVERY
 NOW AND THEN, AND I READ A STUDY
 SOMEWHERE THAT YOU SHOULDN'T
 WASH YOUR JEANS TOO OFTEN.
 DR. OZ: WHERE DID YOU READ THAT
 ARTICLE?
 I DON'T KNOW, BUT I WISH I
 KNEW RIGHT NOW.
 SO I WASH THEM EVERY 3, 4 --
 DR. OZ: TO MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER,
 I GOT A 360.
 THAT WASN'T MUCH BETTER.
 BETHANY, YOUR GENES WERE CLEANER
 THAN ADRIENNE'S, THEN MINES,
 THEN EVERYBODY ELSE.
 EVERY PAIR OF JEANS I'M LOOKING
 AT WAS DIRTIER THAN YOURS.
 HOW OFTEN DO YOU WASH YOURS?
 WHENEVER I WEAR THEM, THEY GO
 INTO THE WASH IMMEDIATELY AFTER.
 DR. OZ: I WANT TO SEE IF YOU ALL
 DO THIS.
 I WANT TO KNOW HOW OFTEN YOU
 WASH YOUR JEANS.
 60% WASH YOUR JEANS BETWEEN
 SECOND AND FOURTH WHERE.
 MOST OF YOU, RIGHT, THAT IS
 UNBELIEVABLE.
 I CAME ACROSS A FAIR AMOUNT OF
 INTERESTING RISKS THAT MIGHT BE
 THERE IF YOU DON'T WASH YOUR
 JEANS ENOUGH.
 BUT NOT THE ONES YOU THINK.
 THE BIGGEST ISSUE, YOU LOOK AT
 ALL THE JEANS, MANY DIFFERENT
 BRANDS, THEY ALL HAVE THE SAME
 POTENTIAL RISK.
 ROUGHLY 60% OF YOU ARE CHANGING
 YOUR JEANS OUT AFTER 2, 3, 4
 WEARS.
 I'M ONE OF THE GUYS OVER HERE,
 SAME AS YOU, IF I WEAR IT FOR AN
 HOUR OR TWO, I'M NOT GOING TO
 WASH MY JEANS.
 BUT HERE'S THE RISK THAT PEOPLE
 DIDN'T REALIZE.
 YOU PROBABLY SAY TO YOURSELF THE
 GERMS ARE ON THE OUTSIDE, RIGHT?
 NOT LIKE IT IS ON THE INSIDE.
 DR. OZ: I SAY THAT TOO,
 ABSOLUTELY.
 THEY CAN'T GET TO ME.
 BUT HERE'S THE CATCH.
 WHEN YOU DON'T WASH YOUR JEANS,
 THIS FABRIC STARTS TO STRETCH.
 THEY BECOME VERY COMFORTABLE.
 WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOUR PANTS ARE
 A LITTLE LOOSE?
 DON'T YOU FEEL GOOD ABOUT LIFE?
 YOU ARE LOSING WEIGHT, RIGHT?
 YOU COULD EAT A LITTLE EXTRA
 BECAUSE THE JEANS ARE LOOSE ON
 YOU.
 WHO CARES ABOUT THE SCALE?
 THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TO WASH OUR
 JEANS EVERY THREE OR FOUR TIMES,
 BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEY STRETCH
 FURTHER OUT AND WE ARE
 SABOTAGING OUR DIETS.
 I THANK YOU FOR YOUR HONESTY.
 I'M GOING TO BRING IN AN EXPERT.
 CAROLYN FORTE IS HERE FROM GOOD
 HOUSEKEEPING TO FIND OUT EXACTLY
 HOW TO WASH YOUR JEANS.
 YOU HEARD FROM THE AUDIENCE.
 WHAT IS THE IDEAL?
 YOU ACTUALLY TEST THESE THINGS.
 CAROLYN: WE TEST JEANS AND
 FABRICS.
 THE BOTTOM LINE IS YOU WANT THEM
 CLEAN, BUT YOU ALSO WANT THEM
 LOOKING GOOD.
 WE SAY EVERY FOUR TO FIVE
 WEARINGS.
 YOU WANT THEM TO LOOK GOOD, BUT
 YOU WANT THEM TO BE CLEAN.
 DR. OZ: YOU COULD GET AWAY WITH
 FOUR OR FIVE TIMES.
 CAROLYN: YOU COULD.
 IF YOU HAVE STAINS OR YOU ARE
 SWEATING IN THEM, YOU NEED TO
 WASH THEM.
 DR. OZ: WHAT ABOUT THIS ISSUE OF
 FREEZING THE GERMS, KILLING THEM
 BY FREEZING THEM?
 I PUT SOME IN HERE.
 PEOPLE PUT THEM IN HERE NEXT TO
 THE FROZEN CARROTS.
 THEY ARE NICE AND CHILLY.
 CRYOTHERAPY.
 WHY DOESN'T THAT WORK?
 CAROLYN: BECAUSE THE BACTERIA
 ISN'T KILLED BY FREEZING IT.
 LIKE IN YOUR FOOD, BACTERIA
 DOESN'T GET KILLED WHEN YOU
 FREEZE IT, IT JUST GOES DORMANT.
 ONCE YOU PUT THEM BACK ON, THEY
 COME BACK UP TO TEMPERATURE,
 THAT BACTERIA COMES TO LIFE
 AGAIN.
 THE ONLY WAY TO CLEAN YOUR GENES
 IS TO WASH THEM.
 DR. OZ: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: NEXT, OUR INVESTIGATION
 CONTINUES WITH DRY CLEANING.
 FIND OUT WHAT OUR GERM TEST
 UNCOVERED.
 [APPLAUSE]

 DR. OZ: NEXT, DORINDA AND JOHN FROM THE REAL HOUSEWIVES ARE
 HERE WITH THE INSIDE SCOOP ABOUT
 DRY CLEANING.
 ARE THEY REALLY CLEANING THEM?
 WHAT IS JOHN'S NICKNAME, BY THE
 WAY?

       I'm a close talker.
  So I was excited about All-New  Colgate Total.
  Its breakthrough formula does  more...
            Wonderful.
     Sensitivity, strengthens     teeth...
 It kills germs through my whole mouth..
     I like your confidence.
         Thanks Mr. Lee!
 Now there's no such thing as too close.
          Yes, there is.
         No, there's not.

 [APPLAUSE] DR. OZ: WE ARE BACK WITH OUR
 FILTHY FEBRUARY INVESTIGATION.
 HOW FILTHY ARE YOUR DRY CLEANED
 CLOTHES, AND WHAT REALLY HAPPENS
 AFTER YOU DROP THEM OFF?
 WE ARE ABOUT TO REVEAL WHAT OUR
 GERM TEST UNCOVERED.
 HERE IS THE CLEANEST COUPLE THAT
 I KNOW, REAL HOUSEWIFE DORINDA
 MEDLEY AND JOHN MAHDESSIAN.
 COME ON OUT.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: YOU LOOK SPARKLING.
 HOW ARE YOU?
 SO, JOHN IS A THIRD-GENERATION
 DRY CLEANER.
 PASSIONATE ABOUT REMOVING
 STAINS.
 CORRECT ME IF THIS RUMOR IS MADE
 UP, BUT SOMEONE SAID YOU
 ACTUALLY SPELLED WINE ON YOUR
 BEAUTIFUL GIRLFRIEND.
 DORINDA: WE HAVE THESE ACCIDENTS
 ONCE IN A WHILE.
 WE WERE DOING A DEMONSTRATION.
 TO TAKE OUT A STAIN, NOT A CUP
 OF WINE.
 JOHN: I WAS SUPPOSED TO POUR A
 LITTLE BIT.
 SHE SAID, NOW WHAT ARE YOU
 DOING?
 I SAID, I HAVE TO GET FIVE MORE
 STAIN KITS.
 DR. OZ: VERY SUAVE.
 DORINDA: ACTUALLY, THERE'S A
 LITTLE SECRET.
 I HAD TO RUN TO THE BACK OF THE
 STORE AND PUT ON SOMEONE'S DRESS
 TO DO THE COMMERCIAL.
 JOHN: BUT IT ALL CAME OUT.
 DR. OZ: WHAT IS THE MOST
 SURPRISING THING YOU LEARNED
 ABOUT DRY CLEANING?
 DORINDA: THE MOST SURPRISING
 THING I LEARNED IT IS NOT JUST
 ABOUT DRY CLEANING.
 IT IS ABOUT STORING AND
 PRESERVING AND INVESTMENT.
 SHE HAS COLLECTIONS FROM ANNA
 WINTOUR.
 DR. OZ: THERE'S A LOT OF
 MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT DRY
 CLEANING.
 WE TOOK A POLL.
 HOW MANY OF YOU THINK THE DRY
 CLEANERS ACTUALLY CLEAN YOUR
 CLOTHES?
 THINK ABOUT THAT.
 70% OF YOU THINK DRY CLEANERS
 DON'T CLEAN YOUR CLOTHES
 THOROUGHLY.
 HOW DO YOU CLEAN IT WITHOUT
 GETTING WET?
 WE SET UP A GERM EXPERIMENT TO
 FIND OUT IF YOUR CLOTHES ARE
 REALLY CLEAN.
 WE HAD SOME OF OUR VIEWERS BRING
 IN DIFFERENT ARTICLES OF
 CLOTHING.
 WE MEASURED THE GERM SCORE.
 THEN WE SENT THE CLOTHES TO
 DIFFERENT DRY CLEANERS.
 ARE YOU READY FOR THE RESULTS?
 ONE-OF-A-KIND EXPERIMENT.
 IF IT DOES WORK, I WANT TO
 UNDERSTAND HOW YOU DO THIS
 MAGIC.
 HERE'S HOW THE GERM SCORE WORKS.
 BELOW 50, THAT IS DORINDA
 QUALITY.
 ABOVE 50, WE WILL SAY IT IS
 DIRTY.
 MORE IS WORSE.
 BEFORE WE SENT THE CLOTHES OFF,
 THERE WAS A VARIED RANGE, BUT
 THEY WERE ALL CONTAMINATED
 BETWEEN 95 AND 430.
 WE SWAPPED THEM AGAIN AFTER THE
 DRY CLEANING AND HERE'S WHAT WE
 FOUND.
 WE GOT ALL THE CLOTHES BACK.
 THE GERM SCORES WERE UNDER 50.
 THEN THE QUESTION COMES, WHAT IS
 GOING ON?
 WHAT DO THEY DO WHEN THEY
 DRYCLEAN YOUR CLOTHES?
 WALK US THROUGH THE PROCESS, HOW
 YOU ACTUALLY GET STUFF CLEAN.
 WE DROP IT OFF.
 WE ARE HERE.
 WHAT HAPPENS?
 JOHN: BASICALLY, WHAT WE DO IS
 WE REMOVE EVERY TYPE OF STAIN.
 DRY CLEANING USUALLY TAKES OUT
 OILY TYPES OF GREASY STAINS.
 DORINDA: THAT IS UNIQUE TO YOU.
 JOHN: ANY TYPE OF STAIN,
 PERSPIRATION, YOU WANT TO
 ERADICATE THEM BEFORE THE
 CLEANING PROCESS.
 THEN IT IS CLEANED USUALLY IN A
 SOLVENT OR OTHER TYPE OF ORGANIC
 SOLVENT.
 DR. OZ: SO EVEN THOUGH IT IS
 CALLED DRY CLEANING, IT GETS
 WET?
 JOHN: DRY CLEANING IS A SOLVENT
 THAT IS NOT WATER.
 THEN IT GOES THROUGH A CLEANING
 PROCESS WITH A DETERGENT, AND IT
 DRIES IN THE SAME CYCLE.
 DR. OZ: SO AFTER ALL THAT, IT
 LOOKS LIKE THIS WHEN WE GET IT
 BACK.
 DORINDA: HERE IT IS.
 JOHN: IT ALWAYS COMES BACK IN A
 PLASTIC.
 YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO REMOVE THE
 PLASTIC, LET IT AIR EIGHT.
 DR. OZ: STAND NEXT TO ME.
 THIS IS WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE WHEN
 THEY COME BACK.
 HERE'S THE CONCERN.
 I WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT WHETHER
 THIS IS REAL.
 PEOPLE ARE SAYING THERE ARE
 DIRTY NEUROTOXINS WHEN YOU USE
 DRY CLEANING.
 TO ALL THE DRY CLEANERS USE
 THIS?
 JOHN: IT WAS A STANDARD IN THE
 INDUSTRY.
 A LOT OF DRY CLEANERS ARE MOVING
 TOWARD A GREEN METHOD, USING A
 WATER-BASED METHOD WITH
 DETERGENT.
 THERE'S ALSO NATURAL FLORA
 CARBONS, LIKE A HYDROCARBON,
 WHICH ARE SAFER TO USE.
 THERE'S OPTIONS.
 YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR CLEANER.
 DR. OZ: THIS CHEMICAL IS
 ASSOCIATED WITH A NEUROTOXIN, SO
 YOU GET DIZZINESS, LOSE
 COORDINATION, LONG-TERM EXPOSURE
 CAN CAUSE COMA, MAYBE EVEN
 DEATH.
 YOU DON'T SEEM AS CONCERNED
 ABOUT IT, BUT WE SHOULD AVOID
 IT?
 JOHN: IF YOU CAN AVOID IT, I
 WOULD RECOMMEND THAT.
 DR. OZ: AND NOBODY SHOULD HAVE
 THESE BAGS IN THEIR HOME.
 WE REACHED OUT TO THE NATIONAL
 CLEANERS ASSOCIATION FOR A
 COMMENT, BUT THEY DECLINED TO
 PROVIDE A RESPONSE.
 JOHN, YOU SAY THERE'S ANOTHER
 TRICK.
 YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO SHARE WITH
 US.
 SPECIFICALLY ABOUT WINE, WHICH
 SEEMS TO FIND ITS WAY ONTO
 DORINDA'S CHEST A FAIR BIT.
 DORINDA: AND LIPSTICK.
 JOHN: IN TERMS OF REMOVING
 STAINS, THERE'S THREE
 CATEGORIES.
 ONE THAT COMES FROM THE EARTH,
 ONE THAT COMES FROM THE BODY,
 AND THE THIRD IS OIL MATTER,
 COOKING GELS, THINGS LIKE THAT.
 FROM THE EARTH, FROM THE BODY,
 AND OIL.
 SO WE HAVE ONE OF DORINDA'S
 BIRTHDAY STAINS.
 SO WE ARE GOING TO DO A HOME
 REMEDY.
 I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW EASY
 IT IS TO REMOVE A STAIN.
 DR. OZ: DO IT RIGHT.
 JOHN: IT'S ALL RIGHT.
 WHAT WE HAVE HERE, A HOME REMEDY
 IS ONE PART DETERGENT, VINEGAR,
 TWO PARTS WATER.
 IF IT IS SMALL, YOU CAN USE A
 Q-TIP.
 WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS GET THIS
 IN.
 IF THERE'S ANY EXCESS, YOU WANT
 TO TEMPE UP.
 SEE, IT IS RIGHT THERE.
 DORINDA: ABSORBENT CLOTH.
 JOHN: YOU ALWAYS WANT TO PUT A
 CLOTH UNDERNEATH IT.
 THEN YOU WANT TO TAKE THIS.
 NOTICE THE STAIN IS DISAPPEARING
 RIGHT NOW.
 DR. OZ: WHAT IS THE WORD YOU
 USED?
 DORINDA: TAMP IT.
 DR. OZ: I'VE NEVER HEARD THE
 WORD BEFORE.
 JOHN: YOU CAN SEE IT GO INTO THE
 ABSORBENT CLOTH.
 DR. OZ: I LIKE THIS.
 JOHN: THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
 IN STAIN REMOVAL IS TIME.
 THE SOONER YOU CAN TREAT A STAIN
 PROPERLY, THE SAFER IT IS.
 THAT IS WHY I HAVE ONE OF THESE
 PROFESSIONAL STAIN REMOVAL KITS
 THAT I HAVE GIVEN TO EVERYONE IN
 THE AUDIENCE.
 [APPLAUSE]
 JOHN: ANYONE OUT THERE THAT
 WANTS ONE, YOU CAN GO TO
 STAINKIT.COM AND USE DR. OZ AS A
 PROMO CODE AND EVERYONE GETS 20%
 OFF.
 COMPLEMENTARY SHIPPING.
 HOW ABOUT THAT?
 DORINDA: WE DIDN'T NICE.
 [APPLAUSE]
 JOHN: ONE STAIN AT A TIME.
 DR. OZ: WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
 HE'S GOOD.
 [APPLAUSE]

 [APPLAUSE] DR. OZ: WE ARE BACK WITH OUR
 FILTHY FEBRUARY INVESTIGATION.
 WE ARE PUTTING EVERYDAY
 HOUSEHOLD ITEMS UNDER A
 MICROSCOPE TO FIND THE FIVE
 SURPRISING THINGS DIRTIER THAN
 YOUR TOILET.
 THESE THINGS ARE DIRTIER THAN
 YOUR TOILET.
 NOW IT IS TIME TO REVEAL THE
 RESULTS OF OUR FILTHIEST
 EXPERIMENT YET.
 HERE TO HELP COUNT DOWN IS MY GO
 TO TESTER, RHENOTHA, WHO KNOWS
 ABOUT THIS STUFF.
 WE GOING THROUGH FIVE THINGS.
 REVEAL THE NUMBER FIVE ITEM THAT
 IS DIRTIER THAN YOUR TOILET.
 RHENOTHA: THE NUMBER FIVE THING
 IS THE KITCHEN SINK.
 DR. OZ: THE KITCHEN SINK?
 RHENOTHA: THE KITCHEN SINK IS
 NASTY.
 DR. OZ: THE BACTERIA EAT THE
 FOOD PARTICLES THAT YOU WASH OFF
 YOUR DISHES.
 RHENOTHA, SHE'S THE GOTO PERSON
 ON THIS.
 THERE'S AN EASY HACK TO MAKE
 SURE YOU'VE GOT A SPARKLING
 CLEAN -- MAY I GET YOUR
 ASSISTANCE?
 THIS IS HOW THEY GLOVE YOU IN
 THE OPERATING ROOM.
 RHENOTHA: MY NURSING ASSISTANT,
 THANK YOU.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: SO, THE SINK IS HERE.
 JUST WASHING IT A LITTLE BIT
 DOESN'T WORK.
 RHENOTHA: YOU HAVE TO GET IN
 HERE WITH BAKING SODA.
 YES, BAKING SODA.
 YOU NEED TO SPRINKLE IT ALL OVER
 YOUR SINK.
 LET THE DUST FLY.
 YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU GET IT
 IN AND GET IT CLEAN.
 LET THAT SIT FOR ABOUT FIVE
 MINUTES.
 YOU WANT TO GET A SOFT TOWEL AND
 GO IN A CIRCULAR MOTION.
 THE REASON YOU WANT TO DO A
 CIRCULAR MOTION IS BECAUSE IT
 DOESN'T CREATE SCRATCHES OR
 ABRASIONS IN YOUR SINK.
 DR. OZ: IT IS SHINING YOUR
 STAINLESS STEEL.
 RHENOTHA: THERE YOU GO.
 DR. OZ: NUMBER FOUR ITEM DIRTIER
 THAN YOUR TOILET, THE COFFEE
 RESERVOIR.
 YOU MIGHT REMEMBER WE REVEALED
 SHOCKING THINGS ABOUT YOUR
 FILTHY COFFEE POT.
 IT CAN BE PRETTY DIRTY.
 IF YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT
 BACTERIA, TAKE VINEGAR WITH
 WATER, PUT HALF OF IT IN THE
 WATER RESERVOIR, CLOSE, AND
 BREWIS.
 30 MINUTES.
 RUN THE WATER THROUGH.
 DO THIS ONCE A MONTH.
 ONCE A MONTH WHEN YOU ARE
 WATCHING TV, DONE.
 NUMBER THREE, PET BOWLS.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?
 [LAUGHTER]
 RHENOTHA: DR. OZ, I'M SURE IT IS
 A NASTY SITUATION GOING ON
 THERE.
 DR. OZ: THE SAME THINGS YOU ARE
 GOING TO USE FOR OUR NEXT
 PROBLEM, YOU ARE GOING TO USE TO
 CLEAN THIS.
 VERY SIMPLE ITEM.
 NUMBER TWO ON OUR LIST IS YOUR
 TOOTHBRUSH HOLDER.
 RHENOTHA: EWW!
 DR. OZ: DYMON IS HERE AND SHE
 SWABBED HER HOUSE AND FOUND THAT
 HER TOOTHBRUSH HOLDER HAD 10
 TIMES MORE GERMS THAN HER TOILET
 SEAT.
 10 TIMES MORE.
 ANY IDEA HOW THAT HAPPENED?
 NO IDEA AT ALL.
 I JUST MOVED INTO THE APARTMENT
 A COUPLE MONTHS AGO.
 MAYBE IT WAS THERE.
 [LAUGHTER]
 DR. OZ: I HAVE A MORE PLAUSIBLE
 EXCUSE, THAT WE ALL HAVE
 TOOTHBRUSH HOLDERS THAT ARE
 DIRTY.
 WHEN WE FLUSH OUR TOILET, THE
 LID AND THE SEAT, THAT
 AEROSOLIZATION OF BACTERIA FROM
 THE TOILET GOES ALL OVER THE
 ROOM.
 A SOLUTION YOU ARE GOING TO
 REMEMBER THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.
 IT IS --
 RHENOTHA: IT IS THE NATURAL
 CLEANING PAD.
 YOU NEED THESE.
 DR. OZ: EXPLAIN THAT.
 RHENOTHA: ALL YOU DO IS PLOT
 THEM IN A BOWL OF WATER.
 DR. OZ: SEE THE BUBBLES?
 RHENOTHA: THE LITTLE
 EFFERVESCENCE GOING ON.
 PLACE THIS INSIDE HERE.
 WHERE ARE MY GLOVES FOR THIS?
 DR. OZ: I DON'T KNOW.
 [LAUGHTER]
 RHENOTHA: AFTER ABOUT 30
 MINUTES, IT SHOULD BE CLEAN.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: BUT YOU HAVE TO LOOK FOR
 THE INGREDIENTS, HYDROGEN
 PEROXIDE AND BAKING SODA.
 IT IS SIMPLE AND EASY TO DO.
 NOW WE ARE DOWN TO NUMBER ONE,
 WHICH ALL OF US HAVE PROBLEMS
 WITH.
 THE FILTHIEST ITEM IN YOUR HOME
 IS THE DISH SPONGE.
 RHENOTHA: DISGUSTING.
 DR. OZ: WE'RE GOING TO GET UP
 CLOSE ON THIS THING.
 YOU SEE THE LITTLE KNOCKS AND
 CRANNIES?
 THAT CAN HARBOR BACTERIA.
 AND THE MOISTURE, IT IS PERFECT
 FOR BACTERIA.
 OPEN YOUR MOUTH.
 [LAUGHTER]
 DR. OZ: YOUR TONGUE IS, THANK
 GOODNESS, CLEANER THAN THAT
 SPONGE.
 ARE YOU READY FOR WHAT WE FOUND?
 LET'S JUST DO IT.
 DR. OZ: WE FOUND BACTERIA WHICH
 IS NOT DANGEROUS, BUT IT IS
 FOUND IN ANIMALS, SO SOMEHOW BAD
 STUFF GOT IN THERE.
 THERE IS A LOT OF STUDIES
 SHOWING THAT TO GET IT OFF, WE
 HAVE TO PUT IT IN THE MICROWAVE,
 BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO WORK.
 RHENOTHA: BUT YOU KNOW WHAT DOES
 WORK, GOOD OLD WHITE VINEGAR.
 SUBMERGE YOUR SPONGE IN SOME
 WHITE VINEGAR.
 I THINK IT IS ABOUT FIVE
 MINUTES.
 [LAUGHTER]
 DR. OZ: DON'T MAKE THE SAME
 MISTAKE TWICE.
 RHENOTHA: SOAK IT FOR
 FIVE-MINUTE AND IT SHOULD BE
 GOOD AS NEW.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: THIS IS 99% EFFECTIVE AT
 GETTING RID OF BACTERIA.
 WE'RE GOING TO PUT THESE ON
 DOCTOROZ.COM.
 SHARE THEM WITH YOUR FAMILY,
 MAYBE EMBARRASS THEM.
 WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
 [APPLAUSE]

 HAVE TO DO IS TAKE THAT WALK
 DOWN MEMORY LANE.
 NOSTALGIA CAN BE THE MISSING
 LINK TO HAVING A POSITIVE
 OUTLOOK ON LIFE.
 IT CAN ALSO HELP US COUNTER
 SADNESS.
 AFTER DOING EXPERIMENTS,
 RESEARCHERS SAY THERE WAS A LINK
 BETWEEN SAVORING SPECIAL MOMENTS
 AND ABILITY TO BOOST YOUR
 SEROTONIN LEVELS AS YOU SEE AN
 IMAGE FROM YOUR PAST THAT MAKES
 YOU SMILE.
 HERE ARE TWO PHOTOS.
 THE FIRST IS A PICTURE THAT WAS
 TAKEN AT MY WIFE'S BIRTHDAY
 PARTY.
 MOMS DON'T GET CELEBRATED
 ENOUGH.
 TO BE ABLE TO GET HER AND TALK
 ABOUT HER, ESPECIALLY WITH THE
 PEOPLE SHE LOVES, WAS FABULOUS.
 THAT IS A GREAT EXAMPLE.
 THE SECOND PICTURE, I ALWAYS
 LAUGH ABOUT.
 MY DAUGHTERS HUDDLING.
 I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF YOU
 CALL FOOTBALL PLAYS.
 IT DOESN'T TAKE THAT LONG AND NO
 ONE SMILES.
 THEY ACTUALLY SAY IT HAS NOTHING
 TO DO WITH FOOTBALL, BUT THEY
 CLAIM THEY WERE CALLING A PLAY.
 BUT I LEARNED A LOT ABOUT MY
 DAUGHTERS BY PLAYING SPORTS WITH
 THEM, SO THAT PHOTO IS IN MY
 OFFICE.
 ANGELIQUE HAS A PHOTO TO SHARE
 WITH US.
 IS THIS YOUR DAUGHTER?
 ANGELIQUE: IT IS A PHOTO OF HER
 IN THE CAR.
 DR. OZ: MY GOODNESS.
 SO CUTE.
 WHAT IS THE MEMORY IT BRINGS
 BACK?
 ANGELIQUE: SHE HAD REALLY FULL,
 CURLY HAIR.
 WE ALWAYS HAD TO KEEP AN EYE ON
 HER.
 NEVER HAD FEAR FOR ANYTHING.
 DR. OZ: SHE STILL HAS CURLY
 HAIR.
 STILL FEARLESS?
 ANGELIQUE: SHE'S MY CRAZY ONE.
 DR. OZ: STILL CRAZY?
 A LITTLE.
 DR. OZ: IN A GOOD WAY.
 I WILL TAKE THAT.
 TAKE A MOMENT TODAY AND LOOK AT
 SOME OLD PHOTOS AND SHARE THEM
 WITH PEOPLE YOU CARE ABOUT.
 TOGETHER, CHANGE IS HAPPENING.
 OUR JOURNEY IS JUST BEGINNING.
