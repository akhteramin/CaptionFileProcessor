 Announcer: LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY, IT'S
 "THE WENDY WILLIAMS SHOW."

 NOW, HERE ARE TODAY'S HOT
 TALKERS!
 B1 HELLO!
 I FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD DO A CONGA LINE!
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 OH, HELLO!
 WELCOME TO "THE WENDY WILLIAMS
 SHOW."
 HOW ARE YOU DOING?
 I'M CARSON KRESSLEY, HOST OF
 BRAVO'S "GET A ROOM."
 SAILOR TO ACTRESS AND TV
 PERSONALITY, TAMMY ROMAN!
 HQ TO BE HOST, SHARON CARPENTER!
 AND POP EXPERT INTO PERSONALITY,
 BRIAN BALTHAZAR!
 ALL RIGHT!
 SHOW WE DIVE INTO HOT TOPICS
 DUES YOU ARE?
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 THE SUPER BOWL IS THIS SUNDAY.
 I HAD NO IDEA.
 IT'S THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS
 VERSUS THE L.A. RAMS.
 I THINK I LIKE THE RAMS!
 MAROON 5 IS DOING THE HALFTIME
 SHOW.
 THAT'S WHERE MY INTEREST PEAKS.
 HALFTIME SHOW, I WATCH.
 THE NFL ANNOUNCED THAT THE GROUP
 WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE
 TRADITIONAL PREGAME PRESS
 CONFERENCE, SAYING THE ARTISTS
 WILL LET THEIR SHOW DO THE
 TALKING.
 [AUDIENCE REACTS]
 WHAT GIVES?
 DO THINK IT'S WEIRD?
 SHOULD THEY HAVE CANCELED THAT?
 Tami: EDIFICATION TO
 CANCELED IT.
 Sharon: I DON'T THINK THEY
 SHOULD'VE CANCELED IT.
 I THINK IT WAS THEIR OPPORTUNITY
 COME AFTER ALL THE BACKLASH, TO
 GET OUT IN FRONT OF THE
 CONTROVERSY BEFORE THE HALFTIME
 SHOW.
 IF THEY REALLY FEEL THEY MADE
 THE RIGHT DECISION BY AGREEING
 TO DO IT, THEY SHOULD BE AFRAID
 TO SPEAK ON IT.
 [APPLAUSE]
 Carson: I AGREE.
 Brian: THIS IS THE FIRST
 THROUGH THAT PRESS CONFERENCE
 WOULD HAVE BEEN INTERESTING AT
 ALL.
 EVERY YEAR, "WE HAVE A GREAT
 SHOW, IT WILL BE AMAZING."
 THIS IS THE RE-WANT TO HEAR WHAT
 THEY HAVE TO SAY.
 Carson: THAT, AND THE YEAR
 THAT CHER DID IT.
 [LAUGHTER]
 A Sharon: THEY SAID THEY
 WANT TO REACH THE FANS DIRECTLY.
 ARE THEY GOING TO DO SOME SORT
 OF A LIFE Q ON SOCIAL MEDIA?
 I DOUBT IT!
 AND THE FANS ARE GOING TO HAVE
 EVEN MORE PROBING QUESTIONS THAN
 THE PRESS, AT THE END OF THE
 DAY.
 THE PRESS IS THERE TO ANSWER
 THOSE QUESTIONS.
 Tami: THIS IS WHY IT'S
 UNFORTUNATE.
 THEY COULD HAVE TAKEN THIS
 OPPORTUNITY TO SAY SOMETHING OF
 VALUE.
 RUNNING AWAY, NOT BEING
 INVOLVED, WHEN IN ACTUALITY THEY
 ARE REALLY NOT COMMITTING A
 CRIME.
 THEY ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING
 THAT'S WRONG.
 THEY ARE PERFORMERS.
 THAT IS THEIR JOB.
 IT IS THE SUPER BOWL, IT'S AN
 AMAZING PLATFORM.
 HALFTIME SHOW.
 WHY NOT BE PROUD TO PARTICIPATE
 IN THAT?
 [APPLAUSE]
 AND, YOU ARE TAKING THE MONEY
 AND DONATING IT TO A CAUSE THAT
 CAN HELP SO MANY OTHERS' LIVES.
 I FEEL LIKE THEY SHOULD BE PROUD
 OF THAT.
 [APPLAUSE]
 Sharon: THE ONLY THING
 ABOUT THAT DONATION -$500,000
 WITH INTERSCOPE RECORDS AND THE
 NFL, TO A CHARITABLE
 ORGANIZATION.
 IS IT TOO LITTLE TOO LATE?
 BECAUSE TRAVIS SCOTT DID THIS A
 COUPLE OF WEEKS BACK.
 AND MAROON 5 -EXACTLY, THEY
 WERE THE FIRST ONES.
 TRAVIS SCOTT CAME AFTERWARDS.
 WHY ARE THEY JUST DOING THIS NO
 NOW?
 I LOVE MAROON 5, BUT IT'S A
 LITTLE SUSPICIOUS.
 Brian: I WILL SAY, IF THE
 MONEY'S GOING TO A GOOD PLACE,
 BRING IT ON.
 THEY NOW HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY.
 WHEN THEY TAKE THAT STAGE, ARE
 THEY GOING TO SAY SOMETHING?
 ARE THEY GOING TO DO SOMETHING?
 ARE THEY GOING TO TAKE A KNEE?
 IT'S UP TO THEM NOW.
 WE ARE LISTENING.
 [APPLAUSE]
 Sharon: THEY'VE GOT TO MAKE
 A STATEMENT.
 THEY'RE GOING TO COME OUT THERE
 STRONG, TRAVIS SCOTT, BIG BOI AS
 WELL.
 AS CONTROVERSY
 YOU AS THIS HAS BEEN, THERE'S A PETITION OF PEOPLE ASKING THEM
 TO PULL OUT.
 PULL OUT OF THE SHOW LAST
 MINUTE.
 SO THEY NEED TO REALLY COME OUT
 STRONG IN THE WORLD IS GOOD TO
 BE WATCHING.
 IT'S GOING TO BE THE HIGHEST
 RATED HALFTIME PERFORMANCE.
 Carson: WE WILL SEE.
 THE SUPER BOWL AIRS THIS SUNDAY
 ON CBS.
 KICK OFF TIME IS AT 6:30 P.M.
 I'M SO GLAD I FOUND OUT ABOUT
 THIS SUPER BOWL THING!
 [LAUGHS]
 TAMAR BRAXTON MADE A SHOCKING
 REVELATION DURING A CONVERSATION
 WITH KANDI BURRUSS IN THE BIG
 BROTHER HOUSE.
 SHE ADMITS THAT HER 5-YEAR-OLD
 SON, LOGAN, SLEEPS WITH HER AND
 HER NEW BOYFRIEND.
 [AUDIENCE REACTS]
 TAKE A LOOK.
 SLIPPING OF THE BED WITH
 ANOTHER MAN?
 THAT'S NOT REALLY HIS
 BUSINESS.
 SOMEBODY THAT LOOKS LIKE HE WAS
 GETTING READY TO MARRY --
 HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
 ALLOWING YOUR SON TO SIT IN THE
 BED WITH Y'ALL?
 RECENT.
 BUT HE DON'T SLEEP ME AND HIM,
 HE WILL COME IN AND SCOOP ME
 OVER.
 Carson: OKAY, I DON'T HAVE
 KIDS.
 I DON'T KNOW ABOUT PARENTING
 FREE BUT THIS DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT
 TO ME.
 IT SEEMS A LITTLE INAPPROPRIATE.
 [APPLAUSE]
 ALSO, WHY DOES SHE LOOK LIKE THE
 UNABOMBER?
 [LAUGHTER]
 Sharon: IT LOOKS LIKE SHE'S
 HAD NO SLEEP.
 PROBABLY BECAUSE THERE'S THREE
 PEOPLE IN THE BED.
 Carson: I WANT TO ASK TAMI.
 YOU COPARENT.
 Tami: I HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS.
 IF IT GETS INAPPROPRIATE.
 SHE HAS A YOUNG SON.
 [APPLAUSE]
 LET ME JUST SAY THIS.
 I LOVE TEMA, SHE KNOWS THAT SHE
 IS MY SIS, BUT SIX MONTHS INTO A
 RELATIONSHIP YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
 EVEN MET MY SON.
 [APPLAUSE]
 I NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE
 GOOD-GOOD.
 YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
 LET GO OF YOUR SEPARATION
 ANXIETY.
 WHEN A CHILD COMES IN TO CLIMB
 INTO BED WITH YOU AND YOUR MAN,
 KEEP THAT SEPARATE.
 TAKE YOUR CHILD BACK TO THEIR
 BED, PUT THEM BACK TO SLEEP,
 MAKE THEM BE A MAN.
 YOU ARE RAISING A MAN, TAE MAR.
 YOU ARE RAISING A MAN.
 [APPLAUSE]
 Sharon: YOU DON'T WANT TO
 BE 20 YEARS OLD, COASTING A
 BETWEEN THE TWO.
 Brian: IT'S EARLY IN THE
 RELATIONSHIP.
 ISN'T THAT WHEN YOU ARE HAVING
 THE MOST SEX?
 THREE YEARS LATER, THREE OR FOUR
 YEARS LATER, HE DON'T WANT TO BE
 NEXT TO EACH OTHER.
 GET IN THE MIDDLE, KID.
 I DON'T WANT TO BE SEEING YOU.
 Sharon: I'M SURE THE
 BOYFRIEND ISN'T TOO HAPPY ABOUT
 IT, EITHER.
 Tami: WE HOPE COME A
 BECAUSE IF HE'S OKAY WITH IT... [AUDIENCE REACTS]
 Carson: IT'S KIND OF WEIRD
 ANYWAY SLICES.
 Brian: ALSO, BE CAREFUL
 WHAT YOU SAY ON "CELEBRITY BIG
 BROTHER."
 THAT'S WHAT THE CAMERAS OF A4.
 Carson: MOVING ON,
 DIXIE CHICKS SINGER NATALIE
 MANES IS GOING THROUGH A NASTY
 DIVORCE.
 AND HER EX WANTS HER TO PAY OFF.
 SHE AND HER HUSBAND SIGNED A
 PRENUP BEFORE THEY GOT MARRIED
 17 YEARS AGO, BUT NOW HE WANTS
 IT THROWN OUT.
 HE'S CLAIMING THAT NATALIE IS
 WORTH $50 MILLION.
 HE ALSO CLAIMS THAT HE IS
 STRUGGLING NOW BECAUSE HE PUT
 HIS CAREER ON HOLD TO TAKE CARE
 OF THEIR TWO KIDS.
 WHO ARE NOW 14 AND 17.
 ADRIENNE WANTS $60,000
 A MONTH IN CHILD AND SPOUSAL SUPPORT, PLUS 350 GRAND FOR HIS
 ATTORNEY FEE.
 THAT SEEMS A LITTLE BIT MUCH TO
 ME.
 I'M SORRY.
 $350,000 A MONTH?
 [APPLAUSE]
 Sharon: THIS IS GOING TO
 SOUND A LITTLE SEXIST, BUT THIS
 MAN SOUNDS LIKE A COMPLETE
 LEECH.
 IF IT WAS THE OTHER WAY AROUND,
 IT WOULD SEEM SO BAD.
 IT IS EXCESSIVE.
 WHAT HE'S ASKING FOR IS $16,000
 IN CHILD SUPPORT, $44,000 AND
 SPOUSAL SUPPORT.
 THREE TIMES AS MUCH!
 THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THAT.
 Carson: RIGHT.
 I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH --
 IF YOU'RE PUTTING YOUR CAREER ON
 HOLD, HELPING RAISE THE KIDS,
 YOU ARE INVESTING IN THAT
 MARRIAGE.
 YOU ARE HELPING GROW THAT
 NETWORK.
 I DO THINK THAT THE AMOUNT
 DOESN'T SEEM REASONABLE.
 I FEEL LIKE YOU DISAGREE.
 Tami: AS A PERSON WHO HAS
 GONE THROUGH THIS MYSELF, I AM
 ACTUALLY ALL FOR HIM GETTING
 CHILD SUPPORT.
 IF IT HAD BEEN A FEMALE, WE
 WOULD HAVE MORE EMPATHY, SAYING,
 "GIVE HER EVERY TIME SHE'S
 ASKING FOR."
 [APPLAUSE]
 I THINK 17 YEARS OF BEING
 MARRIED, I WAS MARRIED FOR SEVEN
 YEARS AND I WANTED ALL MY COINS.
 [LAUGHTER]
 I THINK YOU SHOULD BE ENTITLED
 TO THE SAME.
 HE PUT HIS CAREER ON HOLD, HE
 HAS RAISED THE CHILDREN.
 HOMEMAKER IS A JOB EVEN THOUGH
 PEOPLE LIKE TO MINIMIZE IT.
 [APPLAUSE]
 Carson: ABSOLUTELY.
 Tami: IS AN ACTUAL
 POSITION.
 HE SHOULD BE PAID FOR THAT.
 SPEAKING TO THE PRENUP,
 EVERYTHING IS UP FOR NEGOTIATIO
 NEGOTIATION.
 Brian: BUT ARE THE KIDS
 ALWAYS GOING TO WANT TO STAY AT
 MOM'S HOUSE?
 BECAUSE SHE'S GOT THE
 $10 MILLION PLACE IN THE
 IN-GROUND POOL.
 AND HE'S AT THE APARTMENT
 COMPLEX WITH THE TUB.
 KIDS WON'T BE WANTING TO BE AT
 DADS HOUSE OF MONSTER OF THE
 PALACE.
 Tami: THAT'S WHY I THINK
 YOU SHOULD GET THAT.

 SO THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THE CHILDREN REMAINS THE SAME.
 Sharon: I FIND IT VERY
 INTERESTING, THOUGH, THAT HE
 SAYS HE BACKED UP $200,000 IN
 DEBT TRY TO SUPPORT HIMSELF.
 DOING WHAT?
 Brian: HE'S A WORKING
 ACTOR, HE DOES WORK.
 Carson: HE'S BEEN ON BIG TV
 SHOWS.
 "HEROES."
 Brian: SUPERGIRL.
 Carson: THANK YOU!
 [LAUGHTER]
 Sharon: HE DOES HAVE HIS
 EYE ON THE MONEY SHE'S MAKING
 RIGHT NOW.
 SHE'S ABOUT TO GO ON TOUR THIS
 YEAR, THERE WILL BE EXTRA DOUGH.
 Tami: THAT THE ISSUE, THE
 FUTURE MONEY IS AN ISSUE.
 BUT YOU SPOKE TO SPOUSAL SUPPORT
 EARLIER AND THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS
 A MAJORITY OF HIS MONEY IN.
 HERE'S ONE THING THAT HE'S
 PROBABLY DOING.
 THE CHILDREN, I UNDERSTAND, ARE
 OLDER IN AGE PAID 17 AND 14.
 THAT'S A GOOD FIVE YEARS OF
 CHILD SUPPORT STILL ABLE TO BE
 HAD.
 SOMEONE THAT RUNS OUT, HE'S
 LOOKING FOR THE SPOUSAL SUPPORT.
 THAT IS THE PART THAT I DO NOT
 AGREE WITH.
 I COME FROM THE OLD SCHOOL, THAT
 MEN SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE
 OF THEMSELVES.
 BUT AS IT PERTAINS TO THE
 CHILDREN, HE SHOULD BE ALLOWED
 TO GET THAT.
 [APPLAUSE]
 Brian: I DO THINK THIS
 SPEAKS TO THE FACT THAT YOU
 DON'T REALLY KNOW A PERSON UNTIL
 YOU'VE BROKEN UP.
 YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE
 CAPABLE OF, AND WHAT YOU ARE
 CAPABLE OF.
 BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN THE CLAWS
 COME OUT.
 THIS WILL GET UGLY FOR THEM.
 Sharon: AND HE MAKES
 $150,000 A YEAR.
 THAT'S MORE THAN MOST PEOPLE IN
 AMERICA.
 THAT'S NOTHING TO SNIFF AT.
 Carson: OF COURSE.
 WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
 [APPLAUSE]
 MORE DRAMA FOR TYRESE AND HAS
 ASKED.
 TYRESE IS CLAIMING HIS EX,
 NORMA, JETTED OFF TO TRINIDAD
 WHILE THEIR DAUGHTER WAS
 SUPPOSED TO BE IN HER CUSTODY.
 INSTEAD SHE LEFT HER DAUGHTER TO
 SPEND THE NIGHT AT A CLASSMATE'S
 HOUSE.
 TYRESE IS FUMING BECAUSE NORMA
 IS SUPPOSED TO GIVE HIM THE
 FIRST RIGHT OF REFUSAL IF SHE
 CAN'T BE WITH THEIR DAUGHTER.
 IS HE BEING PETTY, IS THIS A
 LEGITIMATE CONCERN?
 Tami: PETTY BOOTS.
 LET ME TELL YOU WHY.
 THE MOTHER WAS CAUGHT BETWEEN A
 ROCK AND A HARD PLACE.
 SHE WAS GOING ON VACATION, THE
 DAUGHTER WANTED TO SPEND THE
 NIGHT WITH HER FRIEND.
 SHE SAID, "OKAY, I WILL LET YOU
 HAVE ONE NIGHT WITH YOUR FRIEND,
 YOU COULD SPEND THE REST OF YOUR
 TIME WITH YOUR FATHER."
 THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT,
 BECAUSE GUARANTEE THAT DAUGHTER
 WANTED TO SPEND THE NIGHT WITH
 HER FRIEND INSTEAD OF SPENDING
 THE WHOLE WEEKEND WITH HER DAD.
 [APPLAUSE]
 HE NEEDS TO JUST UNDERSTAND, LET
 YOUR CHILD BE A CHILD.
 I WILL ACKNOWLEDGE, THERE WAS A
 COURT ORDER AND HE WANTS HER TO
 FOLLOW IT.
 BUT HE IS DIGGING.
 GRASPING AT STRAWS.
 Brian: HE'S LOOKING FOR IT,
 YEAH.
 KEEPING SCORE AT THAT POINT.
 Sharon: I DO AGREE WITH HIM
 FOR THE FIRST TIME ON THIS ONE.
 ONLY BECAUSE I THINK THERE IS A
 SAFETY ISSUE HERE, AND I CAN'T
 HELP BUT -SORRY GUYS, I THINK
 OF THE MICHAEL JACKSON
 DOCUMENTARY.
 YOU NEED TO KNOW WHERE YOUR
 CHILD IS AT ALL TIMES.
 Carson: SURE.
 Sharon: AS THE FATHER,
 AGAIN, THERE WAS A COURT ORDER
 IN PLACE.
 HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN INFORMED.
 HE SHOULD KNOW WHERE HIS
 DAUGHTER IS SLEEPING AT ANY
 GIVEN TIME.
 Carson: IT'S PROBABLY A
 CASE WHERE THE X SHOULD HAVE
 JUST CALLED AND SAID, "HEY, THIS
 IS WHAT'S HAPPENING."
 Brian: YOU DON'T WANT TO
 FIND OUT ON INSTAGRAM.
 "OH, SHE'S IN TRINIDAD?"
 [LAUGHTER]
 Sharon: HE PICKED HER UP
 THE VERY NEXT DAY.
 BUT HERE'S WHERE IT GETS REALLY
 PETTY.
 APPARENTLY HE'S UPSET ABOUT A
 COUPLE OF SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS.
 FROM 2017.
 HE'S BEEN SCROLLING THROUGH ALL
 THE YEARS THAT FEATURE SHAYLA IN
 THOSE POSTS.
 THERE'S ANOTHER COURT ORDER THAT
 SAYS NEITHER OF THEM CAN POST
 PICTURES OF SHAYLA ON SOCIAL
 MEDIA.
 THAT, HE NEEDS TO LET GO OF.
 Carson: THAT'S CALLED
 TROLLING THE INTERNET.
 HE'S LOOKING FOR STUFF.
 Sharon: EXACTLY.
 HE ACCIDENTALLY LIKES THE
 PICTURE, UNLIKE, UNLIKE.
 Carson: I WORRY ABOUT THAT
 ALL THE TIME!
 WHEN YOU ARE SCROLLING.
 "WHO IS THAT FACE NEXT TO THEM?"
 "DID I JUST LIKE THAT?"
 AND THEN YOU LIKE IT LIKE 15
 TIMES.
 "I DON'T EVEN WANT TO SEE HER
 FACE!"
 Brian: HE HAS A NEW KID AND
 A NEW WIFE.
 SO HE IS ALL ABOUT AIRING HIS
 GRIPES ON INSTA AND SOCIAL
 MEDIA.
 HE'S NOT SHY.
 IS THAT A GOOD IDEA?
 NO, I DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD
 IDEA.
 THAT'S NOT YOUR DIRTY LAUNDRY
 PLACE.
 Sharon: SHAYLA IS THE ONE
 SUFFERING AT THE END OF THE DAY.
 HER PARENTS ARE GOING AT IT, SHE
 SAYS IT FIRST HAND AND ALSO ALL
 OVER THE INTERNET.
 SHE'S ONLINE, I'M SURE HER
 CLASSMATES ARE, IT'S
 EMBARRASSING.
 HUMILIATING, AND PAINFUL.
 [APPLAUSE]
 Carson: ONE OF THOSE
 SITUATIONS WHERE IF THE PARENTS
 ARE GETTING TOGETHER, THEY WOULD
 BE MUCH BETTER FOR THE CHILD.
 Sharon: THEY SHOULD BE THE
 MODEL SPARE THE COMPANY
 COPARENTING. MOVING ON, SORRY TO CUT YOU OFF.
 LORENA BOBBITT IS BACK IN THE
 SPOTLIGHT.
 [APPLAUSE]
 REMEMBER BACK IN 1993?
 I DON'T EVEN LIKE SAYING THIS.
 LORENA CAUGHT OFF HER HUSBAND'S
 PENIS AND THREW IT INTO A FIELD. RIGHT OUT OF THE CAR.
 HOW CAN THEY COULD FIND THAT
 QUESTION BACK THEY CAN'T FIND
 MISSION DOGMAS AND PEOPLE THAT
 THEY CAN FIND THAT
 ANYWAY, THIS IS SERIOUS. OFFICIALS LATER FOUND THE
 SEVERED -AND DOCTORS ARE ABLE
 TO REATTACH IT.
 SHE CLAIMED SHE DID THIS WAS
 SERIOUS BECAUSE HER HUSBAND HAD
 RAPED HER, SOMETHING SHE HAS
 DENIED.
 IT'S NOW THE FOCUS OF A
 FOUR-PART DOCUMENTARY CALLED
 "LORENA" AND WE HAVE A SNIPPET.
 TAKE A LOOK.
 THIS WAS A MODERN LOVE STORY.
 BOY MEETS GIRL, BOY FALLS IN
 LOVE WITH GIRL, BOY MARY'S GIRL,
 GIRL CUTS OFF BOY'S PENIS.
 IT'LL COME DOWN TO WHO THE
 JURORS BELIEF.
 WHEN HE DO TO MAKE HER DO
 SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
 SHE WANTED ME TO HURT.
 THAT'S WHY SHE DID IT.
 HAS BEEN SAYS IF I LEAVE AND
 HE WILL KILL ME.

 [AUDIENCE REACTS]
 Carson: SHE'S NOW GETTING
 THE STAR TREATMENT AT THE
 SUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL WHERE SHE
 HAS BEEN PROMOTING THE SERIES
 WITH PRODUCER JORDAN PEELE.
 SO, ONE OF THOSE CASES, SHOULD
 SHE BE CELEBRATED FOR WHAT SHE
 DID?
 Sharon: I THINK NOT
 NECESSARILY FOR WHAT SHE DID.
 SHE HAS BEEN TREATED AS A
 CELEBRITY.
 TO USE A CELEBRITY, WHO DOESN'T
 KNOW THE NAME?
 WHAT I'M HAPPY ABOUT US FINALLY
 SHE'S GETTING TO TELL HER SIDE
 OF THE STORY.
 BECAUSE WE'VE ALL BEEN LAUGHING,
 LEADING UP TO THE DISCUSSION.
 SHE'S BEEN THE BUTT OF SO MANY
 JOKES OVER THE PAST 26 YEARS.
 FINALLY WE ARE HEARING THE
 REALNESS OF A LOT OF PAIN AND
 STRUGGLE BEHIND THAT STORY.
 IT'S NOT ALL JOKES THERE.
 [APPLAUSE]
 Carson: I AGREE.
 Tami: OKAY, WELL, I DON'T
 WANT TO SEE IT.
 I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.
 I FEEL LIKE SHE TOLD US THE
 STORY ALL THAT MANY YEARS AGO
 WHEN THE INCIDENT FIRST
 HAPPENED.
 I FEEL LIKE SHE IS TRYING TO
 POSITION IT IN A WAY THAT WE ARE
 NOW BEING COGNIZANT OF HER
 EXPERIENCING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
 AND GOING THROUGH THAT.
 I FEEL LIKE, "OKAY, THEN YOU
 COULD PROBABLY TALK TO SHAMIKA.
 YOU COULD TALK TO TONY.
 YOU COULD TALK TO MISS JOHNSON.
 THEY ARE SO MANY WOMEN GOING
 THROUGH THIS IN REAL LIFE, WHY
 DO WE NEED TO GLORIFY HER?
 TREAT HER LIKE A CELEBRITY?
 JUST YOUR STORY, WHEN THERE ARE
 SO MANY REAL PEOPLE?
 YOU WANT TO DO A DOCUMENTARY,
 REACH BACK TO THE REAL PEOPLE.
 HERE REAL WOMEN WHO ARE GOING
 THROUGH THE STRUGGLE.
 I GUARANTEE YOU, WE WILL WATCH
 IT.
 [APPLAUSE]
 Brian: I THINK YOU ARE
 RIGHT.
 BUT I DO THINK IT'S INTERESTING
 TO SEE HOW THE WORLD REACTS TO
 IT NOW VERSUS THEN.
 THERE'S THIS OBVIOUS AWKWARDNESS
 AND TALKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPEN,
 BECAUSE IT WASN'T -IT BECAME A
 JOKE.
 THE TWO OF THEM COULDN'T EAT A
 HOT DOG IN PUBLIC BECAUSE IT
 WOULD'VE BEEN ON
 "THE TONIGHT SHOW."
 THAT'S WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.
 NO SAUSAGE LINKS.
 [LAUGHTER]
 LORENA WAS OFFERED A MILLION
 DOLLARS TO BE ON THE COVER OF
 LABELING MAGAZINE.
 SHE SAID NO.
 BUT HE WAS OFFERED TO BE IN PORN
 MOVIES.
 HE SAID YET!
 HE WAS CELEBRATED.
 BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS WHAT
 ISRAELIS
 BELIEVE TO BE A PROBLEMATIC WIDGET.
 NOW I THINK YOU WOULD HAVE
 REACTED MUCH OF ITALY THEN WE
 DID THEN.
 Sharon: I'M GLAD THESE TWO
 MEN ABIDED AS WELL.
 JORDAN PEELE IS ONE OF THE
 PRODUCERS.
 AND THE DIRECTOR'S MAIL.
 BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT WE NEED, WE
 NEED MILLER MEN FULLY ON BOARD.
 THEY SAY THEY ARE BORED WITH
 THIS MOVEMENT, THE #MeToo
 MOVEMENT, AND THIS BIGGER
 MOVEMENT SO THE WORLD TO BE A
 SAFER PLACE FOR MEN IN GENERAL.
 Tami: THEY WENT AND GOT A
 NAME THAT IS SENSATIONALIZED.
 I LOVE JORDAN PEELE, BUT I WOULD
 HAVE PREFERRED YOU FIND SOME
 REAL WOMEN UNTIL THEIR STORY AND
 REALLY DIG INTO THE ISSUE SO
 THAT WE DON'T LOSE SIGHT OF WHAT
 YOU ARE TRYING TO GET US TO
 UNDERSTAND THE FIRST PLACE.
 THEY ARE STILL LAUGHING.
 WE WERE LAUGHING AT THE CLICK.
 IT'S LIKE WHEN A CHANGE.
 Brian: SHE WAS FOUND NOT
 GUILTY BY REASON OF INSANITY.
 BUT WE WANT TO GET OUT OF THIS
 PROBLEM BEFORE IT GETS TO THE
 POINT WHERE YOU'RE SO DESPERATE
 THAT IT BECOMES AN OPTION.
 I CAN'T IMAGINE THE HORROR OF
 WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE THAT GOT TO
 THAT POINT.
 Sharon: THIS HASN'T REALLY
 BEEN TOLD IN A WAY WHERE HE PAID
 ATTENTION.
 SHE HAS TRIED TO TELL HER STORY,
 BUT WE HAVEN'T LISTENED.
 I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE ISSUE
 IS.
 Carson: WELL, "LORENA"
 PREMIERES FEBRUARY 15TH ON
 AMAZON.
 [APPLAUSE]
 ALL RIGHT, SO THE FUTURE -THE
 FUTURE OF THE SINGER, NOT JUST
 THE CONCEPT OF THE FUTURE.
 THAT ALWAYS CONFUSES ME.
 I'M LIKE "THE FUTURE QUESTION"
 BUT HE DOES NOT HOLD BACK WHEN
 IT COMES TO SHOPPING, YELL.
 HE JUST REVEALED HOW MUCH HE
 SPENDS ON HIS CLOTHES.
 TAKE A LOOK.
 I'M EMBARRASSED TO SHOP,
 BECAUSE THEY THINK I'M TROLLING.
 I DO THIS [BLEEP] FOR REAL.
 I SHOP EVERY DAY.
 I PROBABLY SPEND $200,000 OR
 $32,000" A MONTH.
 IT'S CRAZY, I NEED TO STOP.
 Carson: THAT'S BASICALLY
 MADE, BUT AT T.J.MAXX.
 [LAUGHTER]
 "I'VE GOT THE CREDIT CARD!
 I'M GOING TO TAKE THESE 19
 DOUBLE ISSUES!"
 I GET IT.
 BUT I'M NOT AT THAT LEVEL.
 I'M ALSO NOT A CPA.
 I DON'T EVEN REALLY DO MATH.
 BUT HAVE A CALCULATOR.
 HE'S ARE POORLY WORTH
 $30 MILLION.
 IF YOU SPEND $300,000 A MONTH,"
 HE WOULD BE OUT OF MONEY IN TEN
 YEARS.
 WHAT ABOUT HIS HOUSE AND HIS
 FOOD IN HIS SHELTER?
 Tami: I DON'T BELIEVE HIM.
 Brian: I DON'T BELIEVE HIM.
 IF HE'S BRAGGING.
 CLUB IF YOU BELIEVE HIM.
 [NO APPLAUSE]
 NOBODY BELIEVES HIM!
 Sharon: THAT'S MORE THAN
 10% OF HIS INCOME.
 HE IS WORTH $30 MILLION, AS YOU
 SAID.
 $300,000 A MONTH IS RIDICULOUS.
 HE HAS AN ISSUE, AND ADDICTION.
 HE NEEDS TO REEL IT IN.
 HE WAS NUMBER NINE ON FORBES'
 LIST OF RICHEST RAPPERS LAST
 YEAR.
 HE NEEDS TO TAKE A LEASE OUT.
 NAS, JAY Z, P DIDDY, THEY WERE
 REAL BUSINESSMEN.
 THEY ARE INVESTED AND BUSINESSES
 AND TECH BUSINESSES.
 HE'S JUST MAKING HIS MONEY FROM
 BEING A HOT WRAPPER RIGHT NOW.
 YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE HOT
 RATHER FOREVER.
 [APPLAUSE]
 Tami: YOU KNOW WHAT'S
 FUNNY?
 NONE OF YOU CLAPPED TO SAY THAT
 YOU BELIEVE TO BE IN.
 BUT YOU KNOW WHO DOES BELIEVE IN
 CUSTOMER FEELING KIDS FOLLOWING
 HIM ON SOCIAL MEDIA.
 SO WOULD FORCE A LICK OF IMAGERY
 HE'S PUTTING OUT IS THAT THIS IS
 WHAT SHOULD BE SPENDING OUR
 MONEY ON INSTEAD OF TEACHING
 PEOPLE AND EDUCATING THEM ON HOW
 TO INVEST, HOW TO SAVE.
 WHAT'S AN IRA COME ALL THESE
 OTHER THINGS.
 THEY ARE NOT GETTING THE BENEFIT
 OF THAT WISDOM.
 IT SAID.
 Sharon: HE SAID IN THE SAME
 INTERVIEW THAT HE BITES HIS
 9-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER TEN OR 20
 PAIRS OF CHANEL EVERY TIME YOU
 GO SHOPPING.
 AND HE'S GOT FIVE KIDS.
 SO THAT'S JUST ONE OF THE KIDS
 RIGHT THERE.
 Tami: IS NOT GOING TO FIT
 THEM IN THREE MONTHS.
 Carson: I WONDER IF YOU'D
 LIKE TO ADOPT ANOTHER CHILD!
 [LAUGHTER]
 CALL ME!
 UP NEXT, THE ONE AND ONLY
 VICTORIA GOD HE IS HERE.
 HAVE A SNACK AND COME ON BACK!

 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 Carson: OUR FIRST GUEST IS
 A REALITY START IN THE
 BEST-SELLING AUTHOR.
 SHE HAS A NEW MONEY CALLED
 "VICTORIA GODEY:MY FATHER'S
 DAUGHTER."
 TAKE A LOOK
 I WAS BORN WITH A CONGENITAL HEART DEFECT.
 ACCORDING TO THE DOCTORS COME I
 SHOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD A YEAR
 EARLIER.
 THAT MORNING, I WISHED I WAS.
 I'M VICTORIA GOTTI, AND THIS IS
 THE STORY OF MY FATHER AND ME.
 [AUDIENCE REACTS]
 Carson: PLEASE WELCOME,
 VICTORIA GOTTI!
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

 THANK YOU SO MUCH!
 PUT YOUR FEET ON THAT SHOE CAM!
 WE NEED TO GET A SHOE SHOT!
 THERE WE GO.
 THERE IS MAGICAL SHOE CAM.
 Victoria: ALWAYS THE BEST
 AUDIENCE.
 Carson: AREN'T THEY THE
 GREATEST CUSTOMER GIVE IT UP FOR
 OUR AUDIENCE!
 OKAY.
 I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN 100 YEARS.
 SINCE LIKE 2003, BECAUSE I WAS
 DOING "EYE" AND YOU WERE DOING
 "GROWING UP GOTTI."
 IT WAS THE BRITNEY GASTINEAU
 AREA.
 THERE IS A PARTY, YOU WERE THERE
 WITH THE BOYS.
 Victoria: WE WERE RUNNING
 INTO EACH OF EVERY WHICH WAY.
 Carson: PEOPLE THOUGHT WE
 WERE DATING.
 IT'S NOT TRUE.
 [LAUGHTER]
 DO YOU MISS REALITY TV?
 Victoria: I DON'T MISS
 ANYTHING IN MY LIFE THAT I'VE
 DONE.
 I LOVE EVERYTHING -PEOPLE SAY,
 "YOU HAVE ANY REGRETS?"
 NO.
 I LOOK AT THE BEST PART OF IT.
 Carson: KEEP MOVING, YES.
 WE'VE GOT YOU.
 BUT I THINK WE ALL LOVE THE
 REALITY SHOW WITH YOUR SON.
 RIGHT?
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 THERE THEY ARE.
 THIS IS LIKE PREJERSEY SHORE
 SPIKY HAIR.
 Victoria: THEY WERE OFFERED
 THE JERSEY SHORE, THEY SAID NO.
 Carson: ANY CHANCE HE WOULD
 DO IT A SHOW WITH THEM AGAIN?
 Victoria: WE ARE WORKING ON
 SOMETHING RIGHT NOW.
 YOU'RE THE FIRST TO KNOW.
 NOBODY KNOWS THAT.
 Carson: WHAT'S THE SCOOP,
 WHAT CAN YOU TELL US?
 Victoria: REALLY NOTHING,
 THEY HAVEN'T ALLOWED ME TO SAY
 ANYTHING.
 JUST THAT WE ARE WORKING ON
 SOMETHING.
 I THINK YOU WILL ALL BE REALLY
 HAPPY.
 [APPLAUSE]
 THOSE WHO HAVE ENJOYED IT, WILL
 BE HAPPY.
 Carson: WITH YOU AT THE
 HOTTIE GOTTIS.
 Victoria: GOD BLESS THE
 GIRLS AND THE HOTTIE GOTTIS.
 Carson: DO ANY OF THEM
 STILL LIVE AT HOME?
 Victoria: THAT'S CHRISTMAS
 MINE.
 ONLY ONE.
 I THINK HE ONLY STAYS THERE
 BECAUSE HE THINKS, "I DON'T WANT
 TO LEAVE MOM ALONE," THAT KIND
 OF THING.
 Carson: THEY LIVE AT HOME
 UNTIL THEY ARE LIKE 38.
 [LAUGHTER]
 Victoria: RIGHT.
 I FEEL SO BAD, BECAUSE THE OTHER
 TWO BOLTED AS QUICKLY AS THEY
 COULD KNOWING HE'D BE THE LAST
 ONE LEFT.
 SO I THINK HE FEELS LIKE IT'S ON
 HIM.
 Wendy: I FIGURE LIKES
 LIVING WITH YOU.
 Victoria: WOULD GET ALONG
 GREAT, WE DO.
 THE LITTLE CUTIE IS THE LOVE OF
 MY LIFE.
 THE NEW LOVE OF MY LIFE.
 Carson: OH, MY GOSH, IT WAS
 THAT?
 Victoria: HE IS MY
 GRANDSON.
 I'M A GRANDMA.
 I TELL YOU, I THINK OF WAYS
 EVERY NIGHT TO KIDNAP HIM AND
 GET HIM AWAY WHERE NO ONE COULD
 CATCH US.
 AND WHERE WERE THEY NOT LOOK?
 BECAUSE I WANT THAT BABY.
 [APPLAUSE]
 Carson: I'M HAVING THE SAME
 THOUGHTS ABOUT THE DADDY.
 I WAS LIKE, "MOVE THAT BABY!
 I WANT TO SEE THE SUN!"
 [LAUGHTER]
 NO, I'M TALKING ABOUT THE ONE ON
 THE RIGHT!
 Victoria: YOU TAKE THE BIG
 ONE, I WILL TAKE THE LITTLE ONE.
 Wendy: I NOTICED EVERYONE
 HOW THEY MENTION IT.
 YOUR KIDS ARE SO ATTRACTIVE.
 YOU TURNED OUT SOME GOOD-LOOKING
 PEOPLE.
 RIGHT?
 [APPLAUSE]
 B6 THEY ARE GOOD TO ME.
 THEY ARE SO GOOD TO ME.
 THAT'S IMPORTANT.
 Carson: I THINK IT PROBABLY
 GOES BOTH WAYS.
 YOU ARE A GOOD MOM.
 THEY ARE PAYING IT BACK.
 YOU WERE MARRIED, DIVORCED.
 ARE YOU DATING?
 ANYBODY ON THE ROMANCE HORIZON?
 Victoria: AND DATED, BUT
 NOT ANYBODY SPECIAL RIGHT NOW.
 [AUDIENCE REACTS]
 Carson: IF YOU ARE
 WATCHING, SHE'S NOT TALKING
 ABOUT YOU!
 OKAY?
 [LAUGHTER]
 HOW DO YOU DATE?
 ARE YOU ONLINE?
 Victoria: NO, MY GOODNESS,
 NO PET I WOULD BE SO AFRAID.
 I DON'T TRUST ANYBODY ANYWAY.
 I FEEL LIKE EVERYBODY YOU
 MEET -I ALWAYS LOOK THROUGH
 THEM ANYWAY, AND I FEEL LIKE
 THEY WANT SOMETHING OR THEY NEED
 SOMETHING.
 I CAN'T RAISE ANOTHER SON.
 I CAN'T.
 [APPLAUSE]
 Carson: YOU WILL MEET
 SOMEBODY, DIFFERENCE THAT YOU
 HAVE?
 Victoria: FRIENDS.
 OR, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, WORK.
 THE STRANGEST LITTLE -AS I
 SAID, YEARS AGO, THE EASIEST
 PLACE TO MEET SOMEBODY.
 I LIKE TO GENERALLY KNOW A
 LITTLE BIT ABOUT THEM BEFORE.
 IT'S EASIER THAT WAY.
 BECAUSE IT'S A LITTLE BIT
 MORE -I JUST MISS TRUST A LOT
 OF PEOPLE.
 Carson: I LIKE TO MEET MY
 GUYS AT CHURCH.
 [LAUGHTER]
 GOOD PLACE!
 OR BLOOMINGDALE'S, AS I CALL IT.
 [LAUGHTER]
 Victoria: THAT'S RIGHT.
 IF YOU MET THEM IN CHURCH, YOU
 KNOW IT'S A GOOD GUY.
 Carson: I KNOW!
 YOU'VE GOT TO DO A LITTLE
 PRESCREENING OR SOMETHING.
 I KNOW YOU ARE FRIENDS WITH
 TERESA FROM "RHONJ" ."
 HOW DID YOU GUYS MEET?
 Victoria: IT WAS SO -WE
 REALLY MEANT DOING
 "CELEBRITY APPRENTICE."
 BE WHEN I FEEL YOUR PAIN, I DID
 THAT SHOW, TOO.
 SO HARD.
 Victoria: WHEN THEY'VE GOT
 IT IN FOR YOU, THEY'RE ALL GOING
 TO -YOU HAVE THE BIG --
 Carson: I'VE NEVER DONE A
 SHOW WHERE THEY ACTUALLY WANT
 YOU TO MESS UP.
 I WAS LIKE, "WAIT A MINUTE, YOU
 DIDN'T ORDER MY FURNITURE?
 I'M GAY.
 I'VE GOT A BACKUP.
 [LAUGHTER]
 Victoria: THEY PLAN IT,
 THEY LAY AWAKE AT NIGHT THINKING
 HOW TO GET THAT ONE PERSON WITH
 A BULL'S-EYE.
 Carson: AND HE DID THE SHOW
 TOGETHER SO YOU COULD HAVE BEEN
 ENEMIES BUT THEY BECAME FRIENDS.
 Victoria: THEY WANTED US TO
 BE ENEMIES.
 ONE DAY, HER AND HER HUSBAND
 KNOCKED ON MY DOOR AND WE HIT IT
 OFF.
 WE ACTUALLY ARGUED FIRST.
 AND THEN WE MADE UP.
 Carson: THOSE OF THE BEST
 FRIEND, I THINK.
 WHEN YOU CAN HAVE A LITTLE BIT
 OF A PUSH BACK.
 "I RESPECT YOU, YOU RESPECT ME."
 WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL HAPPEN
 WITH JOE AND THAT WHOLE SCENARI
 SCENARIO?
 Victoria: THEM      I'M HEARE
 AGE OF THINGS LOOK AT VIDEOS.
 I WOULD PERSONALLY BE VERY
 SURPRISED TO SEE IF JOE IS SENT
 TO ITALY AND DEPORTED, AND SHE
 WAS TO STAY HERE.
 I WOULD BE VERY SURPRISED.
 I DON'T THINK THAT THERESA AND
 JOE ARE FINISHED, BY ANY MEANS,
 YET.
 [APPLAUSE]
 Carson: GOTCHA.
 IT'S KIND OF FUN WHEN YOU ARE
 DOING TV PROJECTS, PEOPLE WANT
 TO REACH OUT TO YOU.
 SO YOU BECOME FRIENDS WITH OTHER
 CELEBRITIES.
 I GUESS THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED
 WITH YOU AND LIL KIM.
 Victoria: YES.
 Carson: THERE YOU ARE!
 Victoria: SHE IS SO COOL.
 [APPLAUSE]
 Carson: SHE HAS!
 HOW DID YOU MEET CUSTOMER AND
 SHE DOES REACH OUT TO BE IN A
 VIDEO?
 Victoria: YEAH, SHE PUT MY
 NAME IN A FEW OF HER SONGS AND
 CALLED ONE DAY.
 GOT ON THE PHONE, SAID, "I WANT
 YOU IN MY NEXT VIDEO."
 AND I SAID "I DON'T DO THAT, I
 COULD NEVER!"
 Carson: HOW DID SHE FIND
 YOU?
 Victoria: THROUGH A PRESS
 REP OR SOMEONE.
 SHE REALLY WANTED ME, SHE WAS
 EMPHATICALLY ASKING.
 I SAID, "ALL RIGHT."
 I ADMIRED HER WORK.
 SHE SAID, "MEET US AT THE
 BROOKLYN BRIDGE AT 1:AT
 45:00 A.M. ON TUESDAY NIGHT."
 Carson: IF I HAD A
 NICKEL...
  Victoria: I'M LIKE HALF
 ASLEEP ALREADY, WE WERE DOING
 THE SHOW, WE HAD EARLY CALL.
 I GET OUT, SHE HAS THIS WHOLE
 RUNWAY SET UP.
 THERE'S A FEW GIRLS WITH FOR
 PLAYER LIST.
 IT VERY COLD.
 ONE OF THOSE 6-DEGREE NIGHTS.
 LIKE TODAY.
 I'M FREEZING, AS YOU CAN SEE IN
 THAT PICTURE.
 ALL OF THE SUDDEN SHE DOES THIS
 BIG REVEAL IN THE END, WHIPS UP
 IN HER COAT FOR THIS PRESS
 PHOTO.
 YOU DON'T SEE IT IN ERROR, YOU
 DON'T REALIZE IT, BUT EVERYBODY
 IS LIKE, "BE NOT!"
 AND I'M WONDERING WHAT HAPPENED,
 AND I LOOK AT HER, AND I WENT,
 "OH, MY GOD!
 SHE'S GOT A MAKE BIKINI ON!"
 AND I HAD THE NERVE TO COMPLAIN
 THAT I'M COLD!
 [APPLAUSE]
 AND SHE'S JUST GIVING IT.
 YOU GO GOOD,.
 [LAUGHTER]
 I'M JUST FOLLOWING YOU.
 SEE WHEN YOU HAVE A NEW MOVIE
 OUT FOR A LIFETIME.
 TELL US ABOUT IT.
 [APPLAUSE]
 Victoria: IS A MOVIE ABOUT
 MY LIFE.
 PEOPLE SAY, "YOU AND YOUR DAD,
 YOU'RE DEAD."
 IT'S REALLY MY LIFE.
 I WOULD BE REMISS IF I EXCLUDED
 HIM AND JUST CALLED HIM
 "MR. SMITH."
 SO IT'S INTERESTING, THE
 WRITER -THINGS DIDN'T WORK OUT
 WITH THE WRITER INITIALLY, AND
 THIS IS A PROJECT THAT WE'VE
 BEEN WORKING ON FOR LIKE SEVEN
 YEARS.
 IN THE END, IN 14 DAYS, I WROTE
 IT.
 EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, AND THEY
 RATED IT.
 THEN THEY WANT TO BE IN IT.
 I WENT TO THE SHOOTS.
 IT WAS A PROJECT I THOUGHT I
 WOULDN'T HAVE AS MUCH INPUT OR
 CONTROL OVER.
 I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I REALLY
 FELT SO GRATIFIED ABOUT IT.
 Carson: YOU DID THE WHOLE
 THING.
 GOOD FOR YOU.
 THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING
 HERE.
 I HOPE THE MOVIE IS A BIG HIT.
 VICTORIA'S NEW MOVIE, "VICTORIA
 GOTTI: MY FATHER'S DAUGHTER,"
 PREMIERES ON LIFETIME.
 CAP NEXT WE ARE COOKING IN THE
 "WENDY" KITCHEN.
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

  When I received the diagnosis,
   I knew at that exact moment,       whatever it takes,
   wherever I have to go...I'm          beating this.
          My main focus
  was to find a team of doctors       that work together.
  When a patient comes to CTCA,
    they're meeting a team of   physicians that specialize
   in the management of cancer.
    Breast cancer treatment is      continuing to evolve.
    And I would say that CTCA
   is definitely on the cusp of          those changes.
   Patients can be overwhelmed
  We really focus on taking the              time
   with each individual patient        so they can choose
  the treatment appropriate for              them.
   The care that CTCA brings is        the kind of care
  I've wanted for my patients.
  Being able to spend time with              them,
    have a whole team to look     after them is fantastic.
  I empower women with choices.
     It's not just picking a            surgeon.
 It's picking the care team, and  feeling secure where you are.
    Surround yourself with the  team of breast cancer experts
  at Cancer Treatment Centers of             America
       Comprehensive Cancer          Care Network.

 Way to narrow it down to everything.
