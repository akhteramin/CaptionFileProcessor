[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] When I received the diagnosis, I knew at that exact moment, whatever it takes, wherever I have to go...I'm beating this. My main focus was to find a team of doctors that work together. When a patient comes to CTCA, they're meeting a team of physicians that specialize in the management of cancer. Breast cancer treatment is continuing to evolve. And I would say that CTCA is definitely on the cusp of those changes. Patients can be overwhelmed We really focus on taking the time with each individual patient so they can choose the treatment appropriate for them. The care that CTCA brings is the kind of care I've wanted for my patients. Being able to spend time with them, have a whole team to look after them is fantastic. I empower women with choices. It's not just picking a surgeon. It's picking the care team, and feeling secure where you are. Surround yourself with the team of breast cancer experts at Cancer Treatment Centers of America Comprehensive Cancer Care Network. Visit cancercenter.com. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
