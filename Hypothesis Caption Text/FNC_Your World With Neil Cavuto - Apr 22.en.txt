 00 PEECHP TURNS OUT SRI LANKAN AUTHO@ RECEIVED ■@■@ ABOK
 ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO.
 WHY WASN'T MORE DONE TO STOP
 THIS?
 FORMER U.S. MARINETA
 COUNTERTERRORISM EXPERT JOINS US
 NOW.
 AIN, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF
 THIS, WHAT MANY ARE CALLING A
 CREDIBLE ANDHE OF
 COURSE THE TRAGEDY STILL PLAYING
 OUT?
 WHY THE SRI LANKAN
 INTELLIGENCE SERVICES FAILED TO
 ACT ON THE INFORMATION THEY HAD
 AND WHY OFFICIALS INCLUDING THE
 PRIME MINISTER WERE NOT ADVISED
 OF THE INTELLIGENCE IS AN
 ENORMOUS QUESTION AND AS YOU
 INDICATED A POTENTIAL COLOSSAL
 INTELLIGENCE FAILURE WHOSE
 IMPACT IS MEASURED IN CLOSE TO
 300 CASUALTIES AND OVER 500
 WOUNDED.
 Charles: COULD THEY HAVE
 TAKEN TAKEN IT SERIOUSLY
 CONSIDERING THE SMALL PERCENTAGE
 OF SRI LANKANS WHO ARE
 CHRISTIANS SLIGHTLY MORE ARE
 MUSLIMS -IT'S A 70% BUDDHIST
 COUNTRY.
 COULD THEY HAVE NOT THOUGHT THEY
 WOULD BE A VIABLE TARGET FOR
 THIS KIND OF THING?
 I THINK THOSE ARE ALL FAIR
 QUESTIONS AND PROBABLY AND
 PRESUMABLY THE PURPOSE OF THE
 COMMISSION THAT THE PRESIDENT
 ANNOUNCED, OF COURSE, THAT
 COMMISSION ITSELF HAS TO GET
 THROUGH THE INFIGHTING THAT
 EXISTS IN SRI LANKAN SOCIETY
 WHICH I THINK IS PROBABLY IN
 LARGE PART TO DO WITH THIS, THE
 PRESIDENT, THE DEFENSE MINISTER
 WHO CONTROLS SECURITY SERVICES
 AND A PRIRS WHO WASN'T ABLE TO
 CALL A NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL
 MEETING, ALL THESE ARE LEADING
 TO A BREAKDOWN IN COMMUNICATION
 WHOSE CATASTROPHIC IMPACT WE SAW
 ON EASTER SUNDAY.
 Charles: WE KNOW THIS IS A
 COUNTRY TASUFFERED THROUGH THEIR
 OWN LONG-TERM -THAT SUFFERED
 THROUGH THEIR OWN LONG-TERM
 CIVIL WAR, MUCH TALKED ABOUT THE
 COMING TOGETHER AND REUNITING
 AND LOOKING FORWARD.
 IS THIS ONE OF THE REASONS ALSO
 IT WAS SEEN AS AN EASY TARGET?
 BECAUSE THE
 MASTERMINDS BEHIND THIS WERE
 ABLE TO PULL OFF REALLY AN
 AMAZING CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY.
 SRI LANKA HAS GENERALLY NOT
 BEEN IMPACTED BY MUCH OF THE
 SECTARIAN VIOLENCE WE'VE SEEN IN
 OTHER PARTS OF SOUTHEAST ASIA AS
 WELL AS INDIA AND PAKISTAN.
 THIS GROUP ITSELF RELATIVELY
 UNKNOWN THAT HAD NOT ARTICULATED
 OR UNDERTAKEN A COMPLEX ATTACK
 OR REALLY ANY ATTACK PRIOR.
 IS GOING TO FORCE A LOT OF
 QUESTIONS ABOUT WHATV WHAT'S
 GOING ON AND I THINK WE'RE GOING
 TO SEE BY THE NATURE OF THE
 INTELLIGENCE THAT CAME THROUGH
 FROM INTERNATIONAL INTELLIGENCE
 SERVICES THAT THE SRI LANKANS
 ALLEGEDLY HAD THAT SOME OF THEIR
 STATEMENTS THAT THERE WAS A
 LARGER NETWORK AT PLAY HERE WITH
 INTERNATIONAL CONNECTIONS IS
 GOING TO BEAR OUT.
 Charles: WOULDN'T THIS SEEM
 TO YOU WITH Y EXPERTISE THAT
 THAT IS INDEED THE CASE?
 SOME OF THE THINGS, A VAN BLOWN
 UP THIS MORNING IN FRONT OF A
 CHURCH.
 IDEALLY THE BOVMINGS IN THE
 CHURCH WOULD HAVE DRIVEN --
 IDEALLY THE BOMBINGS IN THE
 CHURCH WOULD HAVE DRIVEN
 PARISHIONERS OUT AND THEY WOULD
 HAVE BEEN DRIVEN INTO THE SECOND
 BOMBING.
 DOESN'T IT SEEM MORE THAN LIKELY
 THAT THEY'VE HAD MAJOR OUTSIDE
 HELP HERE?
 I THINK THAT THAT IS CORRECT.
 USUALLY WHEN YOU SEE THESE SORTS
 OF COMPLEX, COORDINATED ATTACKS
 IT REQUIRES A LOT OF FUNDING.
 A LOT OF PLANNING.
 THE GROUP HAD NOT DEMONSTRATED
 THAT IN THE PAST.
 ALSO, THE SHEER SUCCESS, THE
 COMPLEXITY OF THE DEVICES THAT
 WERE USED USUALLY REQUIRES
 GROUPS THAT ARE OPERATING
 INDEPENDENTLY OR WITH SINGLE
 INDIVIDUALS, A NUMBER OF
 ATTEMPTS.
 THIS GROUP PULLED IT OFF WITH AT
 LEAST EIGHT COORDINATED
 DETONATIONS AS WELL AS ANOTHER
 DEVICE THAT WAS DEFUSED THAT WE
 KNOW OF AT THIS TIME.
 THAT'S INDICATIVE OF A MUCH
 LARGER, BROADER PLOT AND ALSO
 INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED.
 AND I THINK THE FACT THAT THE
 AVAILABLE ALSO INDICATES THAT.
 CharlesAS AN ATTACK
 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A CONDO
 LAST WEEK BY ISIS TOO.
 WHY THEY BEEN CRUSHED SO BADLY
 IN THE MILITARY THEATERS THAT
 THEY'RE GOING TO PLACES WE
 HAVEN'T SEEN THEM BEFORE?
 WE HAVE SEEN ATTACKS ACROSS
 AFRICA.
 ACROSS SOUTHEAST ASIA.
 I THINK THIS IS THE NEW NORMAL
 AS WE DECIMATED THEIR ABILITY TO
 OPERATE IN IRAQ AND SYRIA, THEY
 ARE LOOKING TO OTHER LOCATIONS
 HERE AT HOME AS WELL. AT.
 Charles: MICHAEL MASTERS,
 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
 I APPRECIATE IT.

 Charles: SHARES OF TESLA SHORT-CIRCUITING TODAY,

 THE ELECTRIC CAR COMPANY
 INVESTIGATING AN APPARENT
 EXPLOSION OF AD DEL-S
 R IN SHANGHAI.
   This is Huntsville, Alabama.      AKA, Rocket City, USA.
  This is a very difficult job.    Failure is not an option.
   More than half of employees        across the country
 bring financial stress to work.
      If you're stressed out       financially at home,
  you're going to be too worried   to be able to do a good job.
  I want to be able to offer all         of the benefits
    that keep them satisfied.
 It is the people that is really  the only asset that you have.
   <i> Put your employees on a path</i>
 <i> to financial wellness</i>         <i> with Prudential.</i>
      <i> Bring your challenges.</i>
     Does this map show the
         Peninsula Trail?
  You won't find that on a map.
       I'll take you there.
         Take this left.
 If you listen real hard you can hear the whales.
               Oop.
          You hear that?
     (VO) Our Subaru Outback     lets us see the world.
        Sometimes in ways        we never imagined.
 Charles: HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI IS HOLD A
 CONFERENCE CALL WITH HOUSE
 DEMOCRATS MOMENTS FROM ON
 TO RO THE MUELLER
 REPORT.
 AT LEAST THREEEMOCRATS ARE
 PUSHIN■ IMPEACHMENT BUT THE
 PRESIDENT DOESN'T APPEAR TOO
 CONCERNED.
 TAKE A LISTEN.
 ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT■
 IMPEACHMENT, MR. PRESIDENT?
 NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT.
 Charles: PRESIDENT TRUMP
 SAYING HE'S NOT WORRIED.
 NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT.
 HOW IS THIS ALL GOING TO PLAY
 OUT POLITICALLY?
 LET'S ASK G.O.P. STRATEGIST,
 DEMOCRAT STRATEGIST AND ""THE
 DAILY MAIL"'S" FRANCESCA.
 THERE IS ANXIETY ON THE
 DEMOCRATIC SIDE.
 OLDER FOLKS, STE HOYER'S AND
 EVEN COREY BOOKER■■@/@/@/@/@/@/7
 @/@/TH■7@/@/@/@/@/@/CHARLES.
 THAT'S WHY@/@/@/@/@/@/@/@/@/@/I7

 THE MUPO
 IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMIND@7 THAT

 WEEK WHY THEY ARE HAVING THEIR@7

 HAVING THIS CONFERENCE CALL AT
 5:00 P.M. AND NANCY PELOSI AHEAD
 OF THAT A LETTER TO@/
 COLLEAGUES NOTING THAT S
 FOR I@/@/@/@/@/@/@/@/■7@/@/@/@/
 NOT.
 DEMOCRATS CLEARLY SPLIT ON WHAT
 TO DO NEXT, PARTICULARLY AS THEY
 HEAD INTO 2020.
 Charles: ELIZABETH WARREN IS
 FOR IMPEACHMENT.
 OCASIO-CORTEZ, RASHEED TLAIB.
 SOME OF THE MORE OUTSPOKEN
 MEMBERS.
 IT'S NOT SPLIT 50-50, IT'S
 SPLIT ABOUT 90-10 AGAINST THE
 IDEA OF IMPEACHMENT.
 IMPEACHMENT IS NOT A SERIOUS
 PROPOSAL.
 YOU HAVE A REPUBLICAN SENATE
 WHICH WILL NEVER VOTE TO REMOVE
 THE PRESIDENT.
 YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE ENO VOTES
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 TO HAVE IMPEACHMENT APPROVED
 EVEN ALONG A PURE PARTY-LINE
 VOTE.
 WE HAVE RED-STATE DEMS ON THE
 BALLOT IN 2020 WHO NEED MODERATE
 POSITIONS IN ORDER TO WIN SO
 UNLESS WE WANT TO HAVE A PARTY
 THAT IS ONLY A.O.C., THAT IS
 ONLY ELIZABETH WARREN THAT IS A
 FRINGE POLITICAL MOVEMENT WHILE
 THE 2K3W07 G.O.P. DOMINATES THE
 REST OF THE COUNTRY THIS HAS TO
 BE TAKEN OFF THE TABLE AND
 CONCENTRATE ON THINGS MIDDLE
 CLASS VOTERS WANT.
 Charles: BY THE SAME TOKEN
 YOU HAVE A TON OF INVESTIGATION,
 YOU HAVE ELIJAH CUMMINGS ASKING
 FOR INFORMATION, VUJERRY NADLER
 IN NEW YORK.
 THERE ARE DEMOCRATS CONTINUINGS
 CONTINUING TO PUSH THE ISSUE
 POST MUELLER REPORT AND SOME
 THINK THIS COULD BE A MAJOR
 MISTAKE.
 IT WILL BE A HUGE MISTAKE AND
 THERE IS A HUGE DEMAND FOR BLUE
 MEAT IN THE DEMOCRATIC BASE.
 IN THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY
 THERE IS GOING TO BE A RUSH TO
 THE LEFT TO SEE WHO CAN TAKE THE
 MOST EXTREME POSITION BECAUSE
 IT'S GOING TO PLAY WELL WITH THE
 VOTERS AND THE SENIOR
 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE DEMOCRATS
 KNOW THAT IT'S GOING TO BACKFIRE
 SO THEY'RE TRYING TO WALK IT
 BACK BUT THE MEDIA IS GOING TO
 KEEP STOKING IT AND THE
 DEMOCRATS WHO WANT TO MAKE A
 NAME FOR THEMSELVES ARE GOING TO
 KEEP TALKING ABOUT IT BUT IT'S
 NOT A SERIOUS PROPOSAL AND THE
 AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT NOTHING TO
 DO WITH IT.
 Charles: ON THE OTHER SIDE,
 THE HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE'S
 RANK MEMBER JIM JORDAN TELLING
 NEIL CAVUTO ON "CAVUTO LIVE" HE
 WANTS TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF
 THE RUSSIA PROBE.
 PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF THIS
 DOUBLE STANCE.
 THIS IDEA THERE IS ONE SET OF
 RULES FOR REGULAR PEOPLE BUT A
 DIFFERENT SET IF YOUR IDEA IS
 COMEY, LYNCH OR LERNER, THEY
 WANT PEOPLE TO LAUNCH THESE
 INVESTIGATIONS ON THE FALSE
 PREMISE.
 THEY DO WANT THEM HELD
 ACCOUNTABLE AND I THINK IT'S
 IMPORTANT WE GET TO THE BOTTOM
 OF THIS BECAUSE AS I SAID THAT
 IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HOW IT
 WORKS IN THIS COUNTRY.
 Charles: FRANCESCA, A DOUBLE
 STANDARD HERE?

 SARAH SANDERS SAYING THEY SHOULD

 Charles: ROBERT, DO YOU THINK
 THERE IS AN EQUIVALENCE ISSUE
 THEUBLICANS SAYING SINCE WE
 SPENT SO MUCH TIME AND MONEY
 ANXIETY OVER THIS MUELLER REPORT
 GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT, TO
 QUOTE PRESIDENT TRUMP NO OTHER
 PRESIDENT HAS TO GO THROUGH THIS
 AGAIN?
 LET'S UNDERSTAND HOW DUMB AN
 IDEA THIS IS FOR REPRESENTATIVE
 JORDAN.
 LET'S TAKE THE PRESIDENT AT HIS
 WORD THAT HE SAYS HE WAS
 COMPLETELY EXONERATED BY THE
 MUELLER REPORT.
 NO COLLUSION.
 NO OBSTRUCTION.
 BY REOPENING THIS CAN OF WORMS
 TO INVESTIGATE THE
 INVESTIGATORS, THAT'S GOING TO
 BRING ALL THESE THINGS BACK INTO
 THE PUBLIC EYE.
 THAT'S GOING TO HAVE MORE
 INVESTIGATIONS.
 HAVE MORE HOUSE SUBPOENAS ON
 TRUMP PRESIDENTIAL RECORDS.
 THEY'RE GOING TO BE REOPENING
 TAKING THIS BANDAGE OFF A WOUND
 THAT MIGHT END UP HURTING THE
 PRESIDENT IN THE LONG RUN.
 Charles: SOME SAY THERE WAS
 NEVER AN INVESTIGATION OF THE
 ORIGINS OF THE FISA REPORT AND
 SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT
 WERE NEFARRIOUS FROM THE START
 AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN FLAGGED AS
 NEFARIOUS FROM THE START.
 THERE IS NO STANDARD AT ALL.
 THERE IS NO PRECEDENT FOR
 INVESTIGATING WHAT WAS A RUSSIAN
 HACK AND IT SPIRALLED INTO
 SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
 AND METASTASIZED INTO
 INVESTIGATING THE PRESIDENT AND
 EVERYBODY IN HIS ORBIT FOR
 COLLUSION THAT HE DIDN'T COMMIT
 AND THAT NEVER HAPPENED.
 THIS IS AN EXERCISE IN PROPER
 GOVERNANCE TO ENSURE THAT THIS
 DOESN'T HAPPEN TO ANOTHER
 PRESIDENT.
 Charles: THANK YOU ALL VERY
 MUCH.
 I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
 MEANWHILE, THE F.B.I. ARRESTING
 THE LEADER OF AN ARMED MILITIA
 GROUP POLICING THE NEW MEXICO
 SOUTHERN BORDER OVER THE WEEKEND
 WITH CITIZENS TAKING THE LAW
 INTO THEIR OWN HANDS.
 WHAT DOES THIS IS A ABOUT THE
 CURRENT MIGRANT CRISIS?
           What do you charge for           online equity trades?
      Uh, I'll look into it.
           Lisa Jones!
    Lisa: (On phone) Hey Carl,    what are you charging me
    for online equity trades?

              Lisa:    And do I get my fees back
        if I'm not happy?  Like a Satisfaction Guarantee?
           Ugh. Schwab!
              Lisa:  Oh right, I'm calling Schwab.
          Thanks, Carl!       Wait, Lisa! Lisa...
    <i> Are you getting low costs</i>
            <i> backed by</i>    <i> a satisfaction guarantee?</i>
     <i> If not, talk to Schwab.</i>
  <i> A modern approach to wealth</i>  <i> management.</i>
 Charles: LARRY  THE LEADER OF AN■RMEDROUPINING UNDO
 IN NEW MEXICO AFTER C THE
 ER N■G FEDERAL
 CHARGES.
 IS BORDER PATROL SO OVERWHELMED
 THAT ORDINARY CITIZENS FEEL THE
 NEED TO STEP IN?
 CARL LANDRUM JOINS ME NOW TO
 DISCUSS.
 FIRST, CITIZENS THERE TAKING UP
 ARMS, TRYING TO ASSIST.
 WHAT WOULD YOU TELLTHEM?
 IT'S APPARENT TO THE THAT
 WE'VE GOT A CRISIS DOWN THERE
 AND THEY'RE TRYING TO HELP OUT.
 FIRST OF ALL, THANKS FOR
 HAVING ME, CHAR
 WHEN IT COMES TO CITIZENS TRYING
 TO HELP US OOWN ON THE
 BORDER LIKE THIS, THEY NEED TO
 REMEMBER THAT CUSTOMS AND BORDER
 PROTECTION DOES NOT ENDORSE THIS
 TYPE OF ACTIVITY BY ANY PRIVATE
 GROUP OR ORGANIZATION.
 ON THE BORDER.
 THE BORDER ENVIRONMENT IS A VERY
 COMPLEX ENVIRONMENT AND IT DOES
 REQUIRE VERY UNIQUE SKILL SETS
 TO BE ABLE TO OPERATE SAFELY AND
 EFFICIENTLY DOWN IN THAT AREA,
 AND ALL OF OUR BORDER PATROL
 AGENTS THAT WORK THERE AS WELL
 AS OTHER AGENCIES, AGENTS AND
 OFFICERS THAT WORK IN THE AREA
 ARE HIGHLY TRAINED AND BRING
 IQUE SKILL SETS TO THAT
 NMENT.
 Charles: SO "THANKS BUT NO
 THANKS, PLEASE."
 YUMA DECLARED AN EMERGENCY.
 THE NUMBERS MASSIVE THROUGHOUT
 THE SOUTHERN BORDER BUT YUMA
 STANDING OUT MORE RECENTLY.
 WHAT CAN BE DONE?
 BECAUSE WE DO SEE THE CRISIS.
 WE SEE SEVERAL CARAVANS FORMING.
 NONSTOP.
 WHAT IS THE NEAR-TERM SOLUTION?
 WHAT CAN HELP WITH THE SITUATION
 NOW?
 IT IS AN ABSOLUTE CRISIS FOR
 US, IN YUMA AS WELL AS OTHER
 PLACES ACROSS THE SOUTHWEST
 BORDER OF THE UNITED STATES.
 YUMA IS -THE AMOUNT OF
 ACTIVITY, ILLEGAL ENTRIES
 OCCURRING THERE ARE GROWING
 LITERALLY MONTH BY MONTH
 AVERAGING ABOUT 300 A DAY IN
 YUMA AND THE PROBLEM THERE IS
 THAT THE CAPACITY THAT WE HAVE
 TO DEAL WITH THE SITUATION, TO
 TAKE THESE PEOPLE INTO CUSTODY
 AND PROCESS THEM IN ACCORDANCE
 WITH OUR GUIDANCE IS JUST
 OVERWHELMED.
 Charles: HOW MANY CAN YOU
 NORMALLY HANDLE ON A TYPICAL DAY
 WITH THE MANPOWER THAT YOU
 CURRENTLY HAVE?
 OUR CAPACITY IN YUMA IS ABOUT
 410 PEOPLE.
 THAT'S NORMALLY WHAT WE CAN HOLD
 AND WE'RE DESIGNED TO HOLD
 SINGLE ADULTS FOR UP TO 12
 HOURS.
 Charles: SO 300 A DAY AND
 YOU'RE ONLY EQUIPPED TO HOLD

 OBVIOUSLY OVERWHELMED.
 HOW COME IT WAS -IT S
 LIKE WHOEVER IS COMING HAS
 NCE KNOWLEDGE OF THIS
 SITUATION.
 HOW ARE THEY LEARNING THIS?
 HOW ORGANIZED IS THIS?
 BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE
 BEING OVERWHELMED BUT IT'S A
 DELIBERATE ACTION.
 THE MOCHT OF THESE PEOPLE
 THROUGHOUT THE WESTERN --
 THE MOVEMENT OF THESE PEOPLE
 THROUGHOUT THE WESTERN
 HEMISPHERE IS TRIGGERED BY
 TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINAL
 ORGANIZATIONS PROFITING FROM THE
 MOVEMENT OF THESE HUMAN BEINGS
 THROUGHOUT THE WESTERN
 HEMISPHERE AND INTO THE UNITED
 STATES.
 Charles: CARL, WE'VE HAD THIS
 DISCUSSION.
 IT'S OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
 THE CRISIS CONTINUES TO GET WORK
 ON A DAILY BASIS.
 WE HEAR CONSTANTLY.
 IT'S CONGRESS THAT HAS TO
 RESOLVETHIS.
 FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN DOING YOUR
 JOB, IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE TO
 GIVE SHORT-TERM RELIEF?
 IMMEDIATELY HELPING US
 INCREASE CAPACITY.
 THAT WOULD HELP IN THE IMMEDIATE
 NEAR TERM BUT LONG-TERM LIKE YOU
 MENTIONED WE DO NEED THE SUPPORT
 OF CONGRESS AND THE SUPPORT OF
 EVERY AMERICAN IN THE UNITED
 STATES TO GET WHAT WE NEED IN
 ORDER TO SECURE THE BORDER OF
 THE UNITED STATES.
 Charles: IF THESE FOLKS WERE
 ALLOWED TO REQUEST ASYLUM IN
 THEI COUNTRIES, WOULD THAT
 HELP THE SITUATION AT ALL?
 THAT WOULD HELP THE SITUATION
 BUT AS AN EXAMPLE, IN YUMA
 SPECIFICALLY WHERE I WORK, IN
 THAT PARTICULAR AREA, ONLY 6% OF
 THE PEOPLE CROSSING THE BORDER
 ARE EXPRESSING A CREDIBLE FEAR
 AND REQUESTING ASYLUM SO WE
 WOULD STILL HAVE AN ISSUE WITH
 THE INABILITY TO DETAIN A FAMILY
 UNIT, ESPECIALLY WITH A CHILD,
 FOR GREATER THAN 20 DAYS.
 Charles: WE THANK YOU FOR
 YOUR JOB.
 WE UNDERSTAND HOW TOUGH IT IS.
 WE APPRECIATE YOU COMING ON.
 THANKS, CHARLES.
 Charles: NEW LEGAL BATTLE
 HEATING UP WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP
 FILING A SUIT TO BLOCK A
 SUBPOENA OF HIS FINANCIAL
 RECORDS.

 Charles: PRESIDENT TRUMP SUING HOUSE OVERSIGH@ COMMITTEE
 CHAIRMAN ELIJAH CUMMINGS IN A
 BID TO BLOCK A SUBPOENA SEEKING
 INFORMATION ON HIS FINANCES.
 WHO HAS THE LEGAL HIGH GROUND?
 TRIAL ATTORNEY LISAKOHARSKI
 JOINS US.
 LISA, THIS IS SUCH A FASCINATING
 CASE.
 WALK US THROUGH THIS
 COUNTERATTACK OR
 COUNTERPUNCH-BACK BY PRESIDENT
 TRUMP.
 SURE.
 HE MADE A MOTION TO QUASH THE
 SUBPOENA.
 THERE ARE ESSENTIALLY TWO
 SUBPOENAS.
 WE HAVE ONE FROM THE OVERSIGHT
 COMMITTEE.
 WE HAVE ONE FROM WAYS AND MEANS■
 COMMITTEE. #■
 THIS MOTION IS TO QUASH THE OVE
 AGAINST ELIJAH CUMMINGS AND HE
 COULD POSSIBLY BE SUCCESSFUL.
 THEY ARE LOOKING FOR A
 SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF
 INFORMATION NOT ONLY FROM
 PRESIDENT TRUMP HIMSELF BUT ALSO
 FROM A LOT OF ASSOCIATES.
 Charles: IS THERE PRECEDENT
 FOR THIS?
 IT SEEMS SO UNIQUE THAT HE COULD
 POSSIBLY BE SUCCESSFUL.
 BASED ON WHAT?
 YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT EVERY
 CASE INDIVIDUALLY BUT WHEN A
 COMMITTEE ASKS FOR THIS TYPE OF
 INFORMATION, WHEN THEY SUBPOENA
 INFORMATION OR THEY WANT TO
 ENGAGE IN PERFORMING
 INVESTIGATIONS, THE CONSTITUTION
 STILL IS IN EFFECT AND THE
 CONSTITUTION STATES THEY NEED A
 LEGITIMATE LEGISLATIVE PURPOSE,
 SO IN THE FIRST SUBPOENA WE
 DON'T SEE THAT.
 THE SUBPOENA THAT CAME FROM
 OVERSIGHT.
 THEY ASKED FOR A LOT OF
 INFORMATION.
 THEY SUBPOENAED THE ACCOUNTANTS.
 ALL HIS CORPORATIONS.
 ASKING FOR INFORMATION PREDATIN
 Charles: IT'S A FISHING
 EXPEDITION.
 IN A LOT OF WAYS IT IS, YES,
 THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
 AND OBVIOUSLY I THINK THE
 AMERICAN PUBLIC IS GETTING QUITE
 WEARY FOR THIS FISHING
 EXPEDITION ESPECIALLY FOLLOWING
 THE MUELLER REPORT.
 WEANT TO SEE OUR LEGISLATORS
 GOVERNb b ■ ■ ■ ■ b ■ ■ ■ ■ b b■
 IN THIS CASE■ A VERY NARROW
 ASK.
 IN THE SECOND SUBPOENA THEY DID
 COME UP WITH AIMATE
 PURPOSE SO WE HAVE
 REPRES■8 NOW S■8 WE
  INTERESTING IT'S@■LI KIND OF EF
  CART -CARTEFORE THE■

 C IT■■■ SEEMS A LITTLE SPECIOUS AND CONFUSING AT THE
 VERY LEAST.
 WITH THIS COUNTERSUIT OR
 PUSH-BACK FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP
 HE DID IT AS SORT OF CITIZEN
 TRUMP NOT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND I
 THOUGHT THAT INTERESTING.
 WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?
 I THINK THEY'RE TRYING TO
 MAKE A DELINEATION BETWEEN THE
 FACT THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP, A LOT
 OF THE INFORMATION THAT WAS
 REQUESTED AND SUBPOENAED WAS
 REQUESTED OF CITIZEN TRUCH.
 HE WAS NOT THE ACTING PRESIDENT.
 HE WAS NOT ELECTED TO OFFICE.
 THEY'RE ASKING THIRD PARTIES
 INVOLVED IN ALL OF HIS ANCILLARY
 BUSINESSES -WE'RE TALKING
 ABOUT 10'S OF THOUSANDS OF PAGES
 OF DOCUMENTS AND TAX RETURNS
 THAT ARE GOING TO BE SUBPOENAED
 TO PEOPLE THAT QUITE FRANKLY
 MANY OF THEM PROBABLY AREN'T
 EQUIPPED TO EVEN LOOK INTO THESE
 TAX RETURNS.
 Charles: SOME OF THE NAMES.
 ALL THE MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY.
 EVEN HIS SON BARON.
 HOW DOES THAT WORK?
 IT SEEMS SO -SUCH AN
 OVERREACH.
 WHEN YOU CAST YOUR LINE, YOU
 WANT TO CAST IT INTO A SCHOOL OF
 FISH HOPING TO GET SOMETHING AND
 THAT'S KIND OF WHAT WE'RE
 SEEING.
 IN REALITY WHAT IS THE ULTIMATE
 OUTCOME?
 I THINK EVERY AMERICAN IS ASKING
 THIS QUESTION AND THE REAL THING
 IS EVEN IF THEY WERE TO FIND
 SOME■ILING A■■ TAX■■#RETURN COU
 MISDEMEANOR, HIGH KRIEPZ AND --
 HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS.
 Charles: THAT'S NOT WHAT
 THEY'RE LOOKING FOR.
 WE HAD A TWO-YEAR MUELLER
 REPORT, THE MEDIA SAID THIS WAS
 THE BEST GUY FOR THE JOB, THE
 DEMOCRATS RAISED ROBERT LER,
 THEY DIDN'T LIKE WHAT THEY GOT
 SO THIS FISHING EXPEDITION WHICH
 YOU'RE SAYING ANYTHING THEY FIND
 IN HERE COULD BE LEVERAGED AND
 CONSIDERED NOW THE PLATFORM TO
 GO AFTER SOME ADDITIONAL --
 CERTAINLY.
 THAT'S EXACTLY WHY YOU REQUEST
 THE INFORMATION BUT AGAIN, YOU
 HAVE TO LOOK AT WHERE THIS
 INVESTIGATION IS GOING AND THE

 Charles: YOU THINK PRESIDENT
 TRUMP HAS A GOOD CASE TO PUSH
 BACK?
 I THINK HE HAS A GOOD CASE.
 EVEN IF HE DIDN'T HAVE A GOOD
 CASE, ONCE IT'S IN THE DISTRICT
 COURT AND IT'S APPEALED IT WILL
 GO UP TO THE SUPREME COURT AND
 CERTAINLY THE MOTIVES BEHIND IT
 -IF THERE IS A POLITICAL
 MOTIVE THE SUPREME COURT WILL
 QUASH THE SUBPOENA AND WE'LL
 ALREADY HAVE A NEW PRESIDENT.
 Charles: A POLITICAL MOTIVE
 BEHIND TDENT EVEN WALK
 INTO A COURTROOM WOULD BE
 CONSIDERED A VICTORY.
 LISA, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
 WE'RE MINUTES AWAY FROM
 DEMOCRATS AND THEIR NEXT MOVE ON
 THE MUELLER REPORT AND
 IMPEACHMENT.
 WE'VE GOT THE LATEST ON ALL THAT
 NEXT.
                             <u>■■■■</u>
      I've always been amazed          by what's next.
   And still going for my best,
      even though I live with      a higher risk of stroke
     due to Afib not caused by      a heart valve problem.
 So if there's a better treatment         than warfarin...
         I want that too.
             ELIQUIS.
         ELIQUIS is proven
       to reduce stroke risk       better than warfarin.
    Plus has significantly less
   major bleeding than warfarin.
      ELIQUIS is FDA-approved           and has both.
           What's next?
      Reeling in a nice one.
    <i> Don't stop taking ELIQUIS</i> <i>unless your doctor tells you to,</i>
 <i>as stopping increases your risk</i>       <i> of having a stroke.</i>
  <i> ELIQUIS can cause serious and</i>  <i> in rare cases fatal bleeding.</i>
  <i> Don't take ELIQUIS If you have</i>    <i> an artificial heart valve</i>
      <i> or abnormal bleeding.</i>
      <i> While taking ELIQUIS,</i>    <i> you may bruise more easily</i>
   <i> and it may take longer than</i> <i>usual for any bleeding to stop.</i>
   <i> Seek immediate medical care</i>   <i> for sudden sign of bleeding,</i>
      <i> like unusual bruising.</i>
    <i> ELIQUIS may increase your</i>          <i> bleeding risk</i>
  <i> if you take certain medicines.</i>
         <i> Tell your doctor</i>    <i> about all planned medical</i>
      <i> or dental procedures.</i>
      ELIQUIS, the number one
      cardiologist-prescribed          blood thinner.
 Ask your doctor   if ELIQUIS
      Don't tell your mother. is what's next    for you.
          Dad, it's fine.
          We have<i> ALLSTATE.</i>
     <i> AND WITH CLAIMRATEGUARD</i>   <i> THEY WON'T RAISE YOUR RATES</i>
    <i> JUST BECAUSE OF A CLAIM.</i>
 That's why you're my favorite...
             <i> I KNOW.</i>
     <i> ARE YOU IN GOOD HANDS?</i>
 Charles: HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI SAID A CONFERENCE
 CALL WITH DEMOCRATS TO DISCUSS
 THE ROLLER REPORT.
 PETER DOOCY IS IN D.C. WITH THE
 LATEST.
 HOUSE DEMOCRATS THAILAND FOR
 A CONFERENCE CALL THAT STARTS
 INTO AN A HALF MINUTES AND THE
 PRIMER THEY GOT FROM
 NANCY PELOSI WAS A LETTER WAVING
 THEM AWAY FROM IMPEACHMENT
 PROCEEDINGS.
 SHE WRITES IN PART "WHILE OUR
 VIEWS RANGE FROM PROCEEDING TO
 INVESTIGATE THE FINDINGS OF THE
 MUELLER REPORT OR PROCEEDING
 DIRECTLY TO IMPEACHMENT, WE ALL
 FIRMLY AGREE WE SHOULD PROCEED
 DOWN THE PATH OF FINDING THE
 TRUTH AND IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO
 KNOW THAT THE FACTS REGARDING
 HOLDING THE PRESIDENT
 ACCOUNTABLE CAN BE GAINED
 OUTSIDE OF IMPEACHMENT
 HEARINGS."
 THAT STATEMENT SEEMS TO CONFLICT
 WITH PRIORITIES LAID OUT BY THE
 TOP DEMOCRAT ON THE JUDICIARY
 COMMITTEE, JERRY NADLER.
 DO YOU THINK THIS IS
 IMPEACHABLE?
 YEAH, I DO.
 I DO THINK IF PROVEN, IF PROVEN,
 WHICH HASN'T BEEN PROVEN YET, IF
 PROVEN, SOME OF THIS WOULD BE
 IMPEACHABLE, YES.
 OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE, IF
 PROVEN, WOULD BE IMPEACHABLE."
  SPEAK OF PRESIDENT WEIGHED ,
 TWEETING:
 "ONLY HIGH CRIMES AND
 MISDEMEANORS CAN LEAD TO
 IMPEACHMENT.
 THERE WERE NO CRIMES BY ME
 NO COLLUSION, NO OBSTRUCTION,
 SO YOU CAN'T IMPEACH.
 IT WAS THE DEMOCRATS THAT
 COMMITTED THE CRIMES, NOT YOUR
 REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT!
 TABLES ARE FINALLY TURNING
 ON THE WITCH HUNT!"
 TODAY OF THE EASTERN ROLE,
 PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS ASKED IF HE
 IS WORRIED ABOUT IMPEACHMENT AND
 HE SAID NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT.
 CHARLES.
 Charles: PETER, SO EVERYONE
 IS A LITTLE ANXIOUS ON HOW
 NANCY PELOSI HANDLES THE MORE
 THAT'S THE REAL CGE ONY ON THIS.
 THIS CALL, ISN'T IT?
 THERE ARE GOING TO BE DOZENS
 OF PEOPLE ON THIS CALL.
 THEY HAVE BEEN ON RECENT SUITS
 THE DETAILS OF THE MUELLER
 REPORT WERE PROBABLY RELEASED
 AND NANCY PELOSI WAS OUT OF THE
 COUNTRY LAST WEEK SO THIS IS THE
 FIRST CHANCE FOR HUNDREDS OF
 PEOPLE ALL TO ALL DAY ALONE AND
 HEAR WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY AND
 THEN POTENTIALLY BE HEARD.
 OF CHARLES.
 Charles: I CAN'T WAIT.
 WE WILL GET THE POPCORN.
 THANKS.
 APPRECIATE IT.
 LISTEN, TODAY WAS AN INTERESTING
 DAM AND MARKETS, THE DOW CAME
 BACK BUT IT STILL FINISH LOWER.
 THE OTHER MAJOR INDICES, THE S&P
 AND NASDAQ WERE HIGHER.
 WE HAVE SOME MAJOR EARNINGS OUT
 THIS WEEK AND THIS WILL BE AN
 EVENTFUL WEEK.
 DON'T FORGET THE MARKETS, ALL
 THREE MAJOR INDICES ABOUT 1.5
 PERCENTAGE POINTS AWAY FROM
 ALL-TIME HIGHS THANKS FOR
 JOINING US.
 NEIL WILL BE BACK TOMORROW.
