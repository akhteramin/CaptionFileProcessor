In a study with Ozempic®, a majority of adults lowered their blood sugar and reached an A1C of less than seven and maintained it. Oh! Under seven? And you may lose weight. In the same one-year study, adults lost on average up to 12 pounds. Oh! Up to 12 pounds? A two-year study showed that Ozempic® does not increase the risk of major cardiovascular events like heart attack, stroke, or death. Oh! No increased risk? [Music] Oh, oh, oh, Ozempic®! [Music] Ozempic® should not be the first medicine for treating diabetes, or for people with type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis. Do not share needles or pens. Don't reuse needles. Do not take Ozempic® if you have a personal or family history of medullary thyroid cancer, Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Syndrome type 2, or if you are allergic to Ozempic®. Stop taking Ozempic® and get medical help right away if you get a lump or swelling in your neck, severe stomach pain, itching, rash, or trouble breathing. Serious side effects may happen, including pancreatitis. Tell your doctor if you have diabetic retinopathy or vision changes. Taking Ozempic® with a sulfonylurea or insulin may increase the risk for low blood sugar. Common side effects are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, and constipation. Some side effects can lead to dehydration, which may worsen kidney problems. I discovered the potential with Ozempic®. [Music] Oh! Oh! Oh! Ozempic®! [Music][Music] Ask your healthcare provider if Ozempic® is right for you. My experience with USAA has been excellent. They really appreciate the military family and it really shows. With all that USAA offers why go with anybody else? We know their rates are good, we know that they're always going to take care of us. It was an instant savings and I should have changed a long time ago. It was funny because when we would call another insurance company, hey would say “Oh we can't beat USAA” We're the Webber family. We're the Tenney's We're the Hayles, and we're USAA members for life. Get your USAA auto insurance quote today. Mom! He's Blinking too loud.
