 INJURIES THAT DO GET A CASE AND DO SAY A POLICEMAN IS WRONG.
 ALL POLICEMEN ARE NOT WRONG BUT
 ALL OF THEM ARE NOT RIGHT.
 WE MUST CORRECT A SYSTEM THAT
 SAYS THAT WE WILL DISTINGUISH
 CRIME WHETHER THE ACCUSED HAS ON
 A BLUE UNIFORM OR BLUE JEANS,
 THE LAW MUST BE UP HELD, AND
 WEST PALM SENT THAT MESSAGE.
 THAT DOES IT FOR ME.
 THANKS FOR WATCHING.
 I'LL SEE YOU BACK HERE TOMORROW
 AT 5:00 P.M. EASTERN FOR A NEW
 LIVE EDITION OF "POLITICS
 NATION", UP NEXT, "DEADLINE
 WHITE HOUSE" WITH MY COLLEAGUE
 AND FRIEND NICOLE WALLACE.
 ALOHA, EVERYONE, IT IS 4:00
 IN NEW YORK CITY, I'M JOHN
 HEILEMAN, PRESIDENT TRUMP COULD
 HAVE SPENT THIS MORNING BASKING
 IN THE GLOW OF THE SENTENCE
 HANDED DOWN TO HIS FORMER
 CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN, PAUL
 MANAFORT, A SENTENCE SO LENIENT
 THAT IT GIVES NEW MEANING TO
 SOFT ON CRIME.
 TRUMP SEES THE CYCLE AND TURNED
 IT BACK TO A TOPIC YOU WOULD
 THINK HE WOULD WANT TO AVOID,
 HIS FORMER FIXER MICHAEL COHEN.
 TWEETING ABOUT COHEN'S TESTIMONY
 ON CAPITOL HILL NINE DAYS AGO.
 HERE'S THAT TWEET.
 BAD LAWYER AND FRAUDSTER
 MICHAEL COHEN, SAID UNDER SWORN
 TESTIMONY THAT HE NEVER ASKED
 FOR A PARDON.
 HIS LAWYERS TOTALLY CONTRADICTED
 HIM.
 HE LIED.
 ADDITIONALLY HE DIRECTLY ASKED
 ME FOR A PARDON.
 I SAID NO.
 HE LIED AGAIN.
 HE ALSO BADLY WANTED TO WORK AT
 THE WHITE HOUSE.
 HE LIED.
 NOT ONLY COULD THAT TWEET BE
 CONSIDERED AN ACT OF RETALIATION
 AGAINST COHEN, A WITNESS WHO IS
 ACTIVELY COOPERATING AGAINST
 TRUMP, IT'S A BRAND NEW
 ADMISSION TRUMP HAD A
 CONVERSATION ABOUT A PARDON, AT
 A TIME WHEN COHEN WAS LYING ON
 TRUMP'S BEHALF.
 WE HAVE BEEN HEARING RUMORS
 ABOUT PARDON TALKS BETWEEN
 WITNESSES BUT THIS IS THE FIRST
 TIME WE HAVE BEEN HEARING THAT
 TRUMP MAY HAVE BEEN PERSONALLY
 INVOLVED IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS.
 NEEDLESS TO SAY, TRUMP'S TWEET
 HAS OPENED HIM UP TO MORE
 QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER HE
 DANGLED PARDONS IN FRONT OF MANY
 OTHER OF THE CONVICTED FELONS
 WHO WERE IN HIS INNER CIRCLE.
 THAT'S A TOPIC WE KNOW IS
 UNDERSCRUTINY BY THREE SEPARATE
 INVESTIGATIVE BODIES.
 ROBERT MUELLER COUNSEL, THE
 SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK
 AND THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE
 COMMITTEE.
 AS IF THAT WASN'T ENOUGH
 POTENTIAL PERIL ON THE PARDON
 FRONT, TRUMP ALSO JUST TODAY
 APPEARED TO LEAVE THE DOOR AJAR
 TO GUESS WHAT, A PARDON FOR PAUL
 MANAFORT.
 I FEEL VERY BADLY FOR PAUL
 MANAFORT.
 I THINK IT'S BEEN A VERY VERY
 TOUGH TIME FOR HIM, BUT IF YOU
 NOTICE, BOTH HIS LAWYER, A
 HIGHLY RESPECTED MAN, AND A VERY
 HIGHLY RESPECTED JUDGE, THE
 JUDGE SAID THERE WAS NO
 COLLUSION WITH RUSSIA.
 THIS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH
 COLLUSION.
 THERE WAS NO COLLUSION.
 IT'S A COLLUSION HOAX, IT'S A
 COLLUSION WITCH HUNT.
 THE ONLY ONE DISCUSSING IT IS
 YOU.
 I HAVEN'T DISCUSSED IT.
 THAT'S NEW.
 A COLLUSION WITCH HOAX.
 THAT IS WHERE WE START TODAY
 WITH SOME OF OUR FAVORITE
 REPORTERS AND FRIENDS, PHIL
 RUCKER, MATTHEW MILLER, FORMER
 CHIEF SPOKESPERSON FOR THE
 JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, FORMER
 DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY
 GENERAL AND U.S. ATTORNEY, HARRY
 LITMAN, AND NBC NEWS POLITICAL
 REPORTER, GUYS GREAT TO SEE YOU.
 WISH YOU WERE HERE AT THE DESK.
 I WANT TO START WITH YOU HARRY
 LITMAN AND ASK YOU THIS
 QUESTION.
 IT SOMETIMES TO ME THAT DONALD
 TRUMP WITH HIS TWEET MAY HAVE
 OPENED HIMSELF UP TO, HARD TO
 BELIEVE, ADDITIONAL NEW LEGAL
 EXPOSURE.
 AM I RIGHT OR AM I WRONG?
 YOU'RE RIGHT.
 HE IS THE WORST CLIENT OF ALL
 TIME.
 EVERY TIME HE OPENS HIS MOUTH,
 IT'S MORE PROBLEMS FOR HIM.
 HE'S HERE.
 A WITNESS, IT MAKES ALL THE
 SENSE IN THE WORLD AND THE SDNY
 CONGRESS MIGHT ASK, REALLY, MR.
 PRESIDENT, WHERE WERE YOU, WHAT
 DID YOU SAY TO MICHAEL COHEN IS
 THIS THE ONLY TIME YOU SPOKE
 ABOUT PARDONS.
 BECAUSE OF HIS POSITION AS
 PRESIDENT HE'S BEEN ABLE TO
 ELUDE ASKING QUESTIONS.
 PERHAPS HE DOES IT HERE.
 YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT NED
 FLOOD AND ALL TRUMP LAWYERS ARE
 CRINGING ONCE AGAIN TO HEAR HIM
 BASICALLY ADMITTING, YES, WE HAD
 THIS CONVERSATION, COME AND ASK
 ME ABOUT IT.
 MATT MILLER, I ASK YOU, I
 THINK, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE MORE OF
 A SCHOLAR OF PRESIDENTIAL AND
 LEGAL MATTERS THAN I AM BUT IT
 SEEMS TO ME IT'S POSSIBLE THAT
 DONALD TRUMP IN TWO PLUS YEARS
 IN THE WHITE HOUSE HAS MENTIONED
 THE WORD PARDON IN PUBLIC MORE
 THAN ALL OF OUR PREVIOUS
 PRESIDENTS COMBINED.
 WHAT IS THAT ABOUT?
 I THINK IT'S VERY CLEARLY
 ABOUT SENDING A MESSAGE TO
 WITNESSES AND DEFENDANTS AND
 OTHERS WHO MIGHT -WHO ARE
 FACING THIS DIFFICULT CHOICE
 ABOUT WHETHER TO COOPERATE WITH
 INVESTIGATORS AND TELL
 EVERYTHING THEY KNOW,
 POTENTIALLY IMPLICATING THE
 PRESIDENT OR IMPLICATING THE
 PRESIDENT'S FAMILY OR OTHER
 PEOPLE CLOSE TO THE PRESIDENT OR
 WHETHER TO SIT AND NOT TALK TO
 THEM AND HOLD OUT UNTIL THE END
 OF A TRIAL OR A GUILTY PLEA
 KNOWING THAT AT SOME DAY, THE
 PRESIDENT MIGHT BE THERE FOR
 THEM.
 I THINK THAT'S WHY HE HAS SENT
 THAT MESSAGE IN PRIVATE AS YOU
 ALLUDED TO.
 IT'S BEEN REPORTED THAT HIS
 PREVIOUS ATTORNEY JOHN DOWD HAD
 CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ATTORNEYS
 FOR MIKE FLYNN AND PAUL
 MANAFORT.
 WHY MAYBE HE HAD THIS DISCUSSION

 WITH MICHAEL COHEN.
 IT'S WHY HE SAID IT SO MUCH.
 HIS LINE ABOUT WE ARE THE ONLY
 ONES TALKING ABOUT IS NOT TRUE.
 HE HAS TWEETED ABOUT IT, BROUGHT
 IT UP IN OTHER INTERVIEWS, IT'S
 BEEN A CONSTANT TOPIC OF
 CONVERSATION OFTENTIMES BROUGHT
 UP BY HIM AS IT WAS IN THE TWEET
 TODAY.
 HEIDI, THERE'S REPORTING,
 "THE NEW YORK TIMES" TALKS ABOUT
 HOW TRUMP'S LAWYERS HAVE OFFERED
 PARDONS OR DISCUSSED PARDONS
 WITH PAUL MANAFORT AND MICHAEL
 FLYNN PREVIOUSLY.
 I MEAN, AGAIN, THIS PARDON TALK
 IS JUST, I MEAN, IT'S BEEN A
 CONSTANT FEATURE, AND OBVIOUSLY
 ON SOME LEVEL IT'S BECAUSE OF
 THE FACT THERE'S MORE LEGAL
 JEOPARDY AND PEOPLE AROUND TRUMP
 WHO HAVE BEEN IN LEGAL TROUBLE
 THAN ANY PRESIDENT IN HISTORY.
 AS WE GET A SENSE OF HOW MUCH
 THIS HAS BECOME A FABRIC OF THE
 DISCUSSION, ESPECIALLY IN
 RELATION TO SOME OF THE PEOPLE
 THAT ARE CONVICTED FELONS OR
 SOON TO BE CONVICTED FELONS,
 WHAT DO WE MAKE OF ALL OF THAT,
 AND WHERE THAT DISCUSSION IS
 HEADED AND WHAT WE SHOULD MAKE
 OF IT?
 WELL, I WOULD SAY THAT THE
 BACKDROP TO ALL OF THIS, IF I
 TAKE YOU BACK TO THE VERY
 BEGINNING OF THE SPECULATION AS
 TO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO PAUL
 MANAFORT WAS THAT THERE WERE
 ONLY TWO POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS
 TO EXPLAIN HIS BEHAVIOR AND WHY
 HE WASN'T BEING MORE
 COOPERATIVE.
 EVEN TO THIS DAY, THE SPECIAL
 COUNSEL'S OFFICE SAYS THAT HE
 WAS NOT OFFERING VERY MUCH
 INFORMATION SO THE TWO POSSIBLE
 EXPLANATIONS WOULD BE THAT, ONE,
 HE WAS EXPECTING A PARDON, OR
 TWO, WHATEVER WOULD HAPPEN TO
 HIM, IF HE ACTUALLY DID SING, IF
 HE ACTUALLY DID TALK BECAUSE OF
 HIS CONNECTIONS TO THE RUSSIANS
 WOULD BE WORSE THAN WHAT IS
 GOING TO HAPPEN TO HIM IN TERMS
 OF HIS SENTENCING.
 SO THE PARDONS AND THE PROSPECT
 OF PARDONS HAS BEEN PART OF THE
 FABRIC FROM THE VERY BEGINNING
 AND NOT JUST BECAUSE OF PAUL
 MANAFORT BUT BECAUSE OF THE
 MESSAGE IT MIGHT SEND TO MANY
 OTHER POTENTIAL COOPERATING
 WITNESSES IN TERMS OF MICHAEL
 FLYNN.
 THE INVESTIGATIONS NOW ARE GOING
 INTO A PHASE, THOUGH, JOHN,
 WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO BE
 GETTING INFORMATION OFF THE HILL
 FROM MANY OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE
 COOPERATING AND I JUST MET THIS
 MORNING WITH SOME AIDES FROM ONE
 OF THOSE COMMITTEES AND THEY SAY
 THAT ACTUALLY THEY'RE GETTING A
 LOT OF COOPERATION FROM
 WITNESSES WHO HAVE ALREADY
 PROVIDED THAT INFORMATION TO
 MUELLER.
 SO EVEN IF WE DON'T SEE THAT
 INFORMATION IN TERMS OF A FINAL
 REPORT FROM MUELLER, IT IS BEING
 EXTRACTED NOW BY THESE
 DEMOCRATIC OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES
 ON THE HILL.
 SO PHIL, I WANT TO ASK YOU, I
 WANT TO FOCUS ON ONE PARTICULAR
 THING ABOUT THIS COHEN TWEET,
 WHICH IS THE KIND OF OUT OF THE
 BLUENESS OF IT, AND YOU KNOW, IT
 WAS NINE DAYS AGO THAT MICHAEL
 COHEN TESTIFIED ON CAPITOL HILL,
 AND OBVIOUSLY HE HAS BEEN BACK
 AND COHEN'S NEVER REALLY OUT OF
 THE NEWS, BUT WHAT IS IT YOU
 THINK ON THE BASIS OF YOUR
 REPORTING AND INTUITION THAT
 WOULD CAUSE TRUMP ON THIS
 PARTICULAR MORNING TO DECIDE TO
 GO AFTER, TO RAISED MICHAEL
 COHEN SPECTER AGAIN.
 YEAH, JOHN, WELL, THE REASONS
 I THINK IS ALL WEEK WE HAVE SEEN
 VARIOUS ALLEGATIONS PRESENTED BY
 COHEN'S LAWYERS, AND
 EXPLANATIONS BY TRUMP'S LAWYERS,
 INCLUDING RUDY GIULIANI IN THE
 MEDIA ABOUT THE EXTENT OF THESE
 PARDON CONVERSATIONS, WHAT
 EXACTLY THEY WERE.
 EARLIER THIS WEEK, MICHAEL COHEN
 WAS ON CAPITOL HILL IN CLOSED
 DOOR TESTIMONY TALKING ABOUT
 THESE CONVERSATIONS.
 ACCORDING TO OUR REPORTING, HE
 WAS TELLING CONGRESSIONAL
 INVESTIGATORS THAT HE HAD HAD
 NUMEROUS CONVERSATIONS ABOUT A
 PARDON THAT HAD BEEN DANGLED
 BEFORE HIM BY TRUMP'S LEGAL
 REPRESENTATIVES INCLUDING RUDY
 GIULIANI, AND SO IT'S BEEN IN
 THE ETHER THOUGH WE'RE REMOVED
 FROM COHEN'S TESTIMONY, AND THE
 PRESIDENT FELT LIKE HE WANTED TO
 WEIGH IN.
 WHAT THE PANEL HAS UNDERSCORED
 WHAT TRUMP TWEETED IS VERY
 DIFFERENT THAN WHAT COHEN IS
 ALLEGING ON CAPITOL HILL.
 TRUMP IS TWEETING THAT HE
 HIMSELF HAD A CONVERSATION WITH
 COHEN ABOUT A PARDON AND COHEN
 ASKED HIM FOR A PARDON AND HE
 SAID NO.
 NOW, THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO HAS
 NEVER BEEN KNOWN TO BE
 ESPECIALLY PRECISE IN HIS
 RECOLLECTIONS OR HIS NARRATION
 OF EVENTS, SO I DON'T KNOW IF
 THAT WAS THE TRUTH, BUT IT WAS
 AN EXTRAORDINARY TWEET.
 NO, AND HARRY, IT DOES RAISE
 THIS ISSUE, RIGHT, WHICH IS,
 AGAIN, THE PERSONAL NATURE THAT
 PHIL ALLUDES TO, THE NOTION THAT
 TRUMP HIMSELF WAS INVOLVED IN
 THESE DISCUSSIONS.
 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ONE OF THE
 THINGS YOU WOULD DO.
 YOU SAID HE'S THE WORST CLIENT
 IN THE WORLD BUT IF YOU WANTED
 TO MAINTAIN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF

 PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY, YOU COULD
 SAY I DON'T KNOW WHAT MY LAWYERS
 ARE DOING, THEY MAY HAVE TALKED
 ABOUT PARDONS WITH THESE FOLKS,
 I PERSONALLY THE PRESIDENT OF
 THE UNITED STATES WOULD NEVER
 GET INVOLVED IN THIS.
 TRUMP TODAY SEEMS TO HAVE
 STRIPPED AWAY ANY PLAUSIBLE
 DENIABILITY ON HIS PART.
 IT MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE WHY
 THE PRESIDENT WOULD WANT TO
 INSERT HIMSELF PERSONALLY IN
 THIS DISCUSSION.
 YEAH, 100%, WHY TODAY, YOU
 KNOW, THAT PATH LIES MADNESS, HE
 GETS AN ITCH, HE HAS TO SCRATCH
 IT.
 IT'S 3:00 A.M., AND HE JUST DOES
 BUT RIGHT, IT'S NOT IN HIS
 SELF-INTEREST EXCEPT OF COURSE
 WE HAVE BEEN PILLARING HIM AS A
 CLIENT, DESERVEDLY, BUT, YOU
 KNOW WE'RE IN THE POLITICAL
 REALM.
 DOES PUTTING IT OUT THERE NOW
 FOR SOME REASON GIVE A LITTLE
 JOLT TO THE BASE THAT HE FELT HE
 NEEDED AND IS THAT THE METHOD IN
 HIS MADNESS POSSIBLY.
 I WANT TO FOCUS A LITTLE BIT
 ON MANAFORT HERE YOU GUYS, THERE
 HAS BEEN A TON OF DISCUSSION
 SINCE THE SENTENCE WAS HANDED
 DOWN LAST NIGHT ABOUT HOW
 LENIENT AND FLAGRANT IT WAS AND
 THE TWO TIERS OF JUSTICE.
 RUDY GIULIANI HAD A QUOTE, I
 FEEL TERRIBLE ABOUT THE WAY
 MANAFORT HAS BEEN TREATED.
 I THINK IT'S NOT AMERICAN TO
 KEEP A MAN IN SOLITARY
 CONFINEMENT, TRY TO CRACK HIM.
 HE'S NOT A TERRORIST.
 HE'S NOT AN ORGANIZED CRIMINAL.
 HE'S A WHITE COLLAR CRIMINAL.
 NOTHING TO ME SCREAMS MORE THE
 TWO AMERICAS HERE OR THE TWO
 TIERED NATURE OF AMERICAN
 JUSTICE THAT WE COULD HAVE A
 CONVERSATION IN WHICH SOMEONE
 WHO IS GUILTY OF THE KIND OF
 CRIMES THAT PAUL MANAFORT WAS
 CONVICTED OF TO SAY IT'S NOT A
 SERIOUS CRIME.
 HE'S NOT A TERRORIST AND
 THEREFORE HE'S A JAYWALKER, WHAT
 DO YOU MAKE OF THE SENTENCE
 ITSELF AND CAST YOUR MIND
 FORWARD TO NEXT WEEK WHEN A NEW
 JUDGE IS GOING TO BE LOOKING AT
 PAUL MANAFORT'S OTHER CRIMES AND
 HAS THE POSSIBILITY OF ADDING
 TEN MORE YEARS ON TO HIS
 CUMULATIVE SENTENCE.
 FIRST TIME YOU SAY ABOUT
 ROUGE, KIND OF TRITE WHAT A
 HYPOCRITE HE'S BECOME, BUT IT'S
 IMPORTANT HERE BECAUSE ONE OF
 THE WAYS RUDY GIULIANI MADE HIS
 NAME AS A PROSECUTOR WAS
 PROSECUTING PEOPLE FOR WHITE
 COLLAR CRIMES, INSIDER TRADING
 AND OTHER CASES ON WALL STREET.
 THAT'S WHAT MADE HIM FAMOUS,
 WALKING INTO WALL STREET TRADING
 FLOORS WITH HANDCUFFS.
 THEY ARE SERIOUS CRIMES, AND THE
 ONLY PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY WHO
 SEEM TO THINK PAUL MANAFORT WAS
 TREATED TO HARSHLY, NOT TOO
 LENIENTLY ARE THE PRESIDENT AND
 HIS LEGAL TEAM.
 I THINK THE PROBLEM WITH THIS
 SENTENCE, TWO-FOLD, ONE, IF YOU
 JUST LOOK AT THE NATURE OF HIS
 CRIMES, SETTING ASIDE WHAT
 EVERYBODY ELSE GETS, THE NATURE
 OF HIS CRIMES, THE SENTENCING
 GUIDELINES, THE TEN-YEAR CRIME
 SPREE THAT HE EMBARKED ON, AND
 THE SERIOUS GUILTY VERDICTS
 RETURNED BY THAT JURY ON EIGHT
 COUNTS, OBVIOUSLY I THINK HE
 SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN A MUCH
 MORE SERIOUS, NOT THE FULL 19 TO
 24 YEARS, BUT SOMETHING ALONG
 10, 12 YEARS WOULD HAVE BEEN
 JUSTIFIED BUT THEN WHEN YOU
 COMPARE IT TO EVERYONE ELSE, IT
 REALLY DOES DRIVE HOME THIS
 PROBLEM, WHICH ISN'T NEW, NOT
 UNIQUE TO PAUL MANAFORT.
 WEALTHY POWERFUL WHITE
 DEFENDANTS CONVICTED OF WHITE
 COLLAR CRIMES, AREN'T TREATED
 THE SAME AS POOR DEFENDANTS,
 BLACK AND BROWN DEFENDANTS,
 GUILTY OF VIOLENT CRIMES AND
 NONVIOLENCE CRIMES LIKE DRUG
 DISTRIBUTION.
 TO FOLLOW UP FURTHER ON WHAT
 I ASKED MAT, THE QUESTION OF
 WHAT HAPPENS NEXT, MANAFORT IS
 OPEN TO THE POTENTIAL OF BEING
 PROSECUTED BY NEW YORK STATE IN
 ADDITION TO BEING PROSECUTED FOR
 THE CRIMES HE HAS BEEN
 PROSECUTED FOR AND YOU HAVE AMY
 BERMAN JACKSON, THE JUDGE WHO'S
 GOING TO RULE ON HIS SENTENCING
 NEXT WEEK.
 IF YOU'RE JUDGE BERMAN JACKSON,
 WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT WHAT
 JUST HAPPENED, AND DOES IT PLAY
 ANY ROLE IN HOW YOU CAN ABOUT
 THE SENTENCE THAT YOU DECIDE TO
 HAND DOWN NEXT WEEK?
 YEAH, THAT IS AN INTERESTING
 AND TRICKY QUESTION.
 MUELLER'S SENTENCING MEMORANDUM
 DROPS A FOOTNOTE THAT ANSWERS
 THAT QUESTION YES.
 POINTS TO A PROVISION IN THE
 SENTENCING GUIDELINES AND
 SUGGESTS THAT SHE CAN GO UP TO
 TEN YEARS BASED ON HIS OVERALL
 CONDUCT, IN OTHER WORDS
 ADVERTING TO THE EASTERN
 DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA CONDUCT.
 I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT, THOUGH,
 THAT SHE SHE WOULD HAVE TRIED TO
 KEEP IT INDEPENDENT, AND WOULD
 BE.
 SHE'S A TOUGH SENTENCER, BUT
 WOULD BE LOOKING AT SOMETHING
 LIKE SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS.
 I DO WANT TO POINT OUT, IT WAS
 AN EGREGIOUS DEPARTURE, THE
 SYSTEM NOT DONE WITH PAUL
 MANAFORT AND PROBABLY NEVER WILL
 BE.
 THERE IS NOT JUST THIS COMING
 UP, ALSO AS YOU SAY THE
 POSSIBILITY OF NEW YORK, THREE
 OTHER STATES, INCLUDING RHODE
 ISLAND AND ILLINOIS COULD
 POTENTIALLY INDICT HIM, AND I
 THINK ARE BEGINNING TO LOOK AT
 THAT HARD BECAUSE OF THIS
 SENTENCE.
 HE'S BY NO MEANS OUT OF THE
 WOODS.
 PHIL, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT
 PRESIDENT TRUMP SEIZED ON TODAY,
 AS THE MOST PREDICTABLE THING IN
 THE WORLD, BESIDES THE SUNRISING
 IN THE EAST IS THE NOTION THAT
 TRUMP WOULD SEIZE ON THE NOTION
 THAT THE JUDGE SAID THERE WAS NO
 COLLUSION.
 IT'S NOT REALLY WHAT THE JUDGE
 SAID.
 TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT.
 I KNOW NO COLLUSION IS GOING TO
 BE RINGING IN YOUR EARS PROBABLY
 UNTIL THE DAY YOU DAY, GIVEN THE
 NUMBER OF TIMES TRUMP SAID IT.
 TALK ABOUT THE
 MISCHARACTERIZATION OF THE
 FACTS.
 IT'S BEEN RINGING IN OUR EARS
 FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS NOW.
 THAT WAS A GROSS
 MISCHARACTERIZATION OF WHAT
 JUDGE ELLIS SAID YESTERDAY.
 WHAT HE SAID WAS THAT PAUL
 MANAFORT WAS IN THAT COURTROOM
 FOR CRIMES THAT DO NOT HAVE TO
 DO WITH THE INVESTIGATION OF
 COLLUSION BETWEEN THE TRUMP
 CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA SO THE
 MANAFORT CRIMES WERE SEPARATE
 FROM THE TRUMP COLLUSION/RUSSIA
 INVESTIGATION.
 HE DID NOT AT ALL ARRIVE AT A
 JUDGMENT ABOUT RUSSIAN COLLUSION
 AND DID NOT GIVE THE PRESIDENT A
 CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH AS THE
 PRESIDENT, YOU KNOW, CLAIMED ON
 THE SOUTH LAWN OF THE WHITE
 HOUSE TODAY.
 HEIDI, I WANT TO READ A TWEET
 FROM ADAM SCHIFF, THE CHAIRMAN
 OF THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE
 COMMITTEE.
 THE STATEMENT BY PAUL MANAFORT'S
 LAWYER AFTER AN ALREADY LENIENT
 SENTENCE REPEATING THE
 PRESIDENT'S MANTRA OF NO
 COLLUSION WAS NO ACCIDENT.
 IT WAS A DELIVERED APPEAL FOR A
 PARDON, ONE INJUSTICE MUST NOT
 FOLLOW ANOTHER: SO HE'S
 BASICALLY SAYING, FIRST OF ALL,
 THE JUDGE DIDN'T SAY NO
 COLLUSION, THE LAWYER SAID NO
 COLLUSION, AND THAT WAS INTENDED
 AS AN APPEAL FOR A PARDON.
 TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT YOU
 THINK ADAM SCHIFF'S GAME IS
 HERE, AND HOW THIS ACTION SHOULD
 SHIFT TO CAPITOL HILL ON THE
 MANAFORT FRONT.
 RIGHT, SO BASED ON OUR
 REPORTING, THE INTELLIGENCE
 COMMITTEE ACTUALLY IS GETTING A
 LOT OF INFORMATION IN
 COORDINATION WITH OTHER
 COMMITTEES, LIKE THE FINANCIAL
 SERVICES COMMITTEE, IF THEY
 EVENTUALLY GET TRUMP'S TAX
 RETURNS, THEY'LL GET A LOT MORE
 INFORMATION FROM THAT.
 BUT THEY ARE GOING HARD AT THE
 ISSUE OF COLLUSION.
 THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE
 GOING TO BE EXAMINING, AND
 UNLIKE IN THE SENATE COMMITTEE
 WHERE YOU DID HAVE SOME, YOU
 KNOW, A LITTLE BIT OF A PARTISAN
 BREAK DOWN THERE, ON THE HOUSE
 SIDE, THERE'S GOING TO BE MANY
 MORE WITNESSES NOW COMING IN,
 INCLUDING ALLEN WEISSELBERG THAT
 THEY'VE ALREADY GOT COOPERATING
 AND BASED ON MY REPORTING
 SPEAKING WITH JUDICIARY SOURCES
 THIS MORNING, THEY ARE BY FUR

  -BIFURCATING AND TAKING IT
 SLOW.
 THEY DON'T WANT IT TO BE SEEN AS
 OVERREACH, GOING AFTER THE
 PRESIDENT, WILLY NILLY,
 PARTISANLY THERE IS GOING TO BE
 AN OBSTRUCTION ELEMENT ON THIS.
 AND THE INTENTION, THE COLLUSION
 PART OF THIS STILL HAS MANY MORE
 CHARACTERS TO PLAY OUT.
 TO REPEAT MYSELF FROM THE FIRST
 PART, EVEN IF THE MUELLER
 INVESTIGATION NEVER BECOMES
 PUBLIC, THIS WILL ALL ULTIMATELY
 BECOME PUBLIC THROUGH
 INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE.
 I THOUGHT IT WAS NOTABLE THAT
 FOR INSTANCE, ONE OF THE
 CHARACTERS THAT SCHIFF WANTS TO
 BRING BEFORE HIS COMMITTEE IS
 FELIX SAIDER, VERY CLOSE TO THE
 TRUMP FAMILY AND VERY CLOSE TO
 THE RUSSIAN MAFIA.
 IT'S NOTABLE THAT SCHIFF WANTED
 TO BRING HIM INITIALLY IN
 PUBLIC, WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE
 ALREADY GOT THEIR HANDS ON A LOT
 OF INFORMATION THAT THEY WANT TO
 BRING TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
 THAT WAS SCHEDULED FOR NEXT
 WEEK AND HAS BEEN DELAYED UNTIL
 LATER IN MARCH.
 HEIDI, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
 YOUR TIME.
 HARRY LITMAN FOR YOUR GOOD LOOKS
 AND GENIUS WHEN YOU'RE ON THE
 SHOW.
 WHEN WE COME BACK, BREAK OUT
 YOUR WEST WING DEPARTURE BINGO
 CARDS, BILL SHINE IS OUT AFTER
 LESS THAN A REPORT.
 NEW REPORTING REVEALS HOW THE
 FOX NEWS ALUM MANAGED TO WIND UP
 ON TRUMP'S BAD SIDE IN THE BEAT
 OF AN EYE.
 ALSO A MOLE INSIDE THE WHITE
 HOUSE WHO LEAKED THE DIRT ON
 JARED AND IVANKA'S SECURITY
 CLEARANCE TO INVESTIGATORS IN
 CONGRESS, AND HE'S NOT EVEN IN
 THE RACE YET BUT THE HITS
 AGAINST JOE BIDEN ARE ALREADY
 COMING.
 I SPOKE TO ONE PROMINENT
 DEMOCRAT WHO'S SAYING THANKS BUT
 NO THANKS.
 WE'LL SEE THAT VIDEO A LITTLE
 BIT LATER SO STAY WITH US.
 WE'VE GOT A LOT COMING.
                         STAY WI. WE'VE GOT A LOT COMING
  WE DON'T FOLLOW THE NAYSAYERS.

 THE REVOLVING DOOR OF WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR
 JUST KEEPS ON SPINNING.
 TRUMP'S 5th COMMUNICATIONS
 DIRECTOR IS OUT.
 BILL SHINE, HE'S RESIGNING AFTER
 SERVING IN THE POSITION FOR JUST
 EIGHT MONTHS, WHICH BY TRUMP'S
 STANDARDS IS, APPROXIMATELY 22
 SCARAMUCCIS, THE LONGEST ANYONE
 HAS HELD THIS POSITION UNDER
 TRUMP.
 HE SOLIDIFIED THE PRSIDENT'S
 TIES.
 MR. SHINES PRESENCE IN THE WHITE
 HOUSE WAS SEEN AS HOW EMBLEMATIC
 TRUMP HAS ALIGNED HIMSELF WITH
 FOX, AND EMBRACING LINES OF
 ARGUMENT THAT ADVANCED ON BEHALF
 OF HIS POLICIES AND PRESIDENCY.
 AS "THE WASHINGTON POST"
 REPORTS, QUOTE IN RECENT MONTHS,
 TRUMP HAS COMPLAINED ABOUT HIS
 MEDIA COVERAGE AND BLAMED SHINE
 FOR NOT MAKING IF MORE POSITIVE
 ACCORDING TO CURRENT AND FORMER
 ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS.
 JOINING ME NOW ON THE SET IS
 FORMER OBAMA CAMPAIGN MANAGER
 AND DEPUTY WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF
 STAFF JIM MESSINA AND JENNIFER
 REUBEN, MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR, MATT
 MILLER AND PHIL RUCKER ARE STILL
 WITH US.
 PHIL, I WANT TO START WITH YOU,
 I BELIEVE THE LAST THING I READ
 IS FROM A PIECE YOU WROTE.
 THAT'S RIGHT.
 TELL US ABOUT WHY NOW THE
 MOMENT ARRIVED FOR BILL SHINE'S
 EXIT?
 YEAH, JOHN, WELL, IT WAS A
 PRETTY ABRUPT ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY
 BUT NOT ALL TOGETHER SURPRISING.
 WE KNOW JUST FROM OUR REPORTING
 THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS THAT
 TRUMP AND SHINE HAVE NOT BEEN
 SEEING EYE TO EYE ENTIRELY.
 IN PART BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT
 EXPECTED THAT BY BRINGING IN
 BILL SHINE, THE FORMER FOX NEWS
 PRESIDENT, HE WAS GOING TO
 SOMEHOW IMPROVE HIS MEDIA
 COVERAGE THAT THE NEWS NARRATIVE
 ABOUT THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY WOULD
 SOMEHOW EVOLVE INTO A MUCH
 GREATER PLACE FOR TRUMP AND THAT
 JUST DIDN'T HAPPEN.
 SHINE DOESN'T HAVE A MAGIC WAND.
 HE CAME IN TO DO THIS JOB BUT AT
 THE END OF THE DAY, THE
 PRESIDENT IS THE PRESIDENT, AND
 THE NEWS MEDIA LIKE OURSELVES,
 WE'RE JUST COVERING WHAT THE
 PRESIDENT DOES.
 HE GREW FRUSTRATED WITH SHINE.
 THEY WERE NOT SORT OF NATURAL,
 YOU KNOW, THERE WASN'T A LOT OF
 NATURAL CHEMISTRY THERE, AND I
 THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY,
 THEY DECIDED TO GO SEPARATE WAYS
 AND SHINE, IT'S IMPORTANT TO
 POINT OUT IS STAYING IN THE
 ORBIT.
 HE'S GOING TO BE AN ADVISER TO
 THE REELECTION CAMPAIGN, OF
 COURSE NO LONGER IN THE WHITE
 HOUSE.
 IN ANOTHER WORLD, A NORMAL
 WORLD, THE WORLD YOU AND I USED
 TO INHABIT, IT WAS NOT AN
 UNCONVENTIONAL THING, A COUPLE
 OF YEARS INTO AN ADMINISTRATION.
 YOU START TO TURN YOUR EYES
 TOWARD REELECTION.
 THERE WOULD BE SOME PEOPLE WHO
 WERE WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS WHO
 WOULD LEAVE THE WHITE HOUSE AND
 WORK ON THE CAMPAIGN.
 I BELIEVE THAT HAPPENED IN YOUR
 WHITE HOUSE RIGHT AROUND THIS
 TIME.
 WHY SHOULD WE NOT THINK THAT
 THIS IS JUST, YOU KNOW, GETTING
 READY FOR REELECTION AS OPPOSED
 TO KIND OF THE WAY IT'S BEING
 PORTRAYED IS SHINE GOT FIRED AND
 THIS JOB ON THE CAMPAIGN IS A
 SPACE SAVING GESTURE.
 THE CAMPAIGN IS THE PLACE
 WHERE THEY GO TO DUMP THE
 BODIES.
 YOU GET FIRED FROM THE WHITE
 HOUSE.
 THEY PUT YOU ON THE REELECTION
 CAMPAIGN, AND I DON'T BLAME THIS
 GUY.
 I HAVE NEVER MET BILL SHINE.
 THEY'RE LASTING A HUNDRED DAYS
 FOR A VERY GOOD REASON, EVERY
 MORNING THE PRESIDENT OF THE
 UNITED STATES WAKES UP AND BLOWS
 UP THEIR COMMUNICATIONS PLAN
 WHEN HE GETS ON TWITTER.
 THAT JOB IS IMPOSSIBLE.
 NO ONE CAN STAY THERE BECAUSE
 YOU HAVE AN ERRATIC LEADER AT
 THE TOP, AND THEY CAN PUT A NEW
 PERSON IN THE JOB, WE'RE ABOUT
 TO GET OUR FOURTH CHIEF OF
 STAFF, FIVE COMMUNICATIONS
 DIRECTORS, MORE LAWYERS THAN YOU
 AND I CAN COUNT AND BECAUSE THE
 ROT BEGINS AT THE TOP.
 I ASK YOU JENNIFER, ONE OF
 THE THINGS, BUT LET ME READ A
 LITTLE BIT FROM THIS PIECE IN
 THE NEW YORKER, YOU WERE QUOTED
 IN IT, AND THIS PIECE RUNG A LOT
 OF BELLS THIS WEEKEND, NOW WITH
 SHINE GOING OUT, IT SEEMS
 INCREDIBLY WELL TIMED OR ONE OF
 THE THINGS THAT PRECIPITATED THE
 DEPARTURE.
 A SOURCE CLOSE TO TRUMP SAYS
 THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN
 COMPLAINING THAT SHINE HASN'T
 BEEN AGGRESSIVE ENOUGH.
 LATE LAST YEAR TRUMP TOLD THE
 SOURCE SHINE PROMISED ME PRESS
 COVERAGE WOULD GET BETTER BUT
 IT'S GOTTEN WORSE.
 TRUMP THOUGHT HE WAS GETTING
 ROGER AILES BUT INSTEAD HE GOT
 ROGER AILES GOPHER.
 TALK ABOUT THIS A LITTLE BIT,
 AND THE SHINE PERPLEX.
 YES, WELL, SHINE OF COURSE
 WAS THE PERSON WHO WAS THE CLEAN
 UP GUY.
 HE WENT AROUND AND CLEANED UP
 THE MESSES FROM ROGER AILES,
 FROM BILL O'REILLY, FROM ALL OF
 THEM.
 YOU KNOW, HE IS NOT THE GUY WHO
 MAKES THE PRETTY PICTURES, HE'S
 THE GUY WHO MANAGES THE TALENT
 WHO HELPED TRUMP GET ELECTED.
 SO PERHAPS TRUMP DIDN'T EXACTLY

 GET WHAT HE WANTED BUT AS JIM
 SAID NO ONE IS GOING TO GET HIM
 WHAT HE WANTS, TRUMP IS TRUMP
 AND HE'S GOING TO GO DO HIS OWN
 THING.
 I THINK IT'S VERY POSSIBLE THAT
 THE ARTICLE KIND OF WAS THE
 TIPPING POINT FOR TRUMP.
 IF THERE'S ONE THING TRUMP HATES
 IT'S TO BE PORTRAYED AS
 SOMEONE'S PAWN, AND HE HATES
 THAT KIND OF STUFF, SO THAT
 COULD WELL HAVE BEEN THE FINAL
 STRAW.
 IT STRIKES ME AS SORT OF
 SCANDALOUS, I'LL STICK WITH YOU,
 ONE OF THE THINGS JANE WROTE
 ABOUT IN THIS PIECE, BILL SHINE
 WAS MORE PERSONALLY INVOLVED
 WITH COVERING UP THE RECORD OF
 ROGER AILES WITH RESPECT TO
 SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN THE
 WORKPLACE THAN ANY OTHER SINGLE
 PERSON THAT I KNOW OF, AND IT'S
 AMAZING TO ME THAT HE GLIDED
 INTO THIS JOB WITH ALMOST NO
 COMMENT ABOUT THAT, DID NOT
 BECOME A MATTER OF PUBLIC
 CONTROVERSY THAT BILL SHINE WAS
 GOING TO THE WHITE HOUSE GIVEN
 SOME OF THE DARK PARTS HE HAD
 DONE AT FOX NEWS.
 HE WAS INVOLVED IN SOME OF THE
 DIRTIEST STUFF.
 HE WENT TO WORK FOR A GUY WHO
 PAID OFF TWO WOMEN WITH SLUSH
 MONEY, A LINEUP OF 19 WOMEN
 DURING THE CAMPAIGN WHO MADE
 ALLEGATIONS OF HARASSMENT.
 THIS IS A GUY WHO STUCK BY ROB
 PORTER, THE WHITE HOUSE STAFF
 SECRETARY AFTER IT HAD BEEN
 REVEALED, REALLY HORRIBLE
 PICTURES OF BATTERY ON HIS WIFE.
 AND HE WAS THE GUY OF COURSE WHO
 WENT OUT AND ENDORSED ROI MOORE.
 THE PRESIDENT IS A WALKING
 DISASTER IN THIS AREA, AND SO
 EVERYONE SORT OF LIKE PALES BY
 COMPARISON.
 THIS IS PART OF THE TRUMP
 PHENOMENON.
 HE HAS BROUGHT US ALL DOWN TO
 THIS BASE LEVEL SO THIS NO
 LONGER RINGS ALARM BELLS AND
 PRACTICALLY ANYONE CAN WALK IN
 THE DOOR.
 TRUMP WALKED IN THE DOOR, WHY
 NOT HIM.
 TRUMP DOESN'T LIKE TO BE SEEN
 AS A STOOJ OR PUPPET, AND THE
 NOTION HE'S BEING PUSHED AROUND
 OR CONTROLLED BY OUTSIDE FORCES
 ANNOYS HIM.
 THIS STORY POINTED OUT THE
 EXTENT TO WHICH TRUMP IS IN
 CONSTANT COMMUNICATION WITH SEAN
 HANNITY, THERE'S THE BILL SHINE
 ELEMENT TO THE STORY, AND YET
 TODAY WE HAVE TRUMP ON TWITTER
 TWEETING THANK YOU AT FOX AND
 FRIENDS, GREAT SHOW.
 SO IT DOESN'T SEEM AS THOUGH,
 TRUMP MAY HAVE GOTTEN SICK OF
 BILL SHINE BUT THAT STORY AND
 THE CONTROVERSY AROUND IT DOES
 NOT SEEM TO HAVE TURNED DONALD
 TRUMP AGAINST FOX NEWS.
 I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'RE EVER
 GOING TO SEE TRUMP TURN AGAINST
 FOX NEWS AS LONG AS, YOU KNOW,
 THE TALENT ON FOX CONTINUES TO
 PRAISE HIS PRESIDENCY, AND HIS
 AGENDA.
 IN MANY WAYS, SHINE WAS THE
 NEXUS, HE WAS THE GLUE THAT
 BROUGHT THE WHITE HOUSE AND FOX
 TOGETHER.
 IT WAS SHINE WHO HELPED ARRANGE
 FOR SEAN HANNITY TO DO THESE
 INTERVIEWS IS AT ALL OF THE BIG
 INTERNATIONAL SUMMITS AND TO BE
 ALONGSIDE THE PRESIDENT AS HE
 TOURED THE BORDER DOWN IN TEXAS
 A WEEK OR TWO AGO, A MONTH OR
 TWO AGO, RATHER, SO SHINE PLAYED
 THAT ROLE, BUT SOMEBODY ELSE IS
 GOING TO STEP IN AND PLAY THAT
 ROLE GOING FORWARD.
 IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S GOING TO
 BE A BREACH BETWEEN TRUMP AND
 HIS FAVORITE NETWORK.
 WE ALL KNOW THAT TRUMP REALLY
 OWN TALKS FOX NEWS BUT IT'S
 STRIKING TO SEE THE GRAPHIC.
 LET'S PUT THIS UP, THE NUMBERS
 ON THE INTERVIEWS, NETWORK
 INTERVIEWS WITH DONALD TRUMP,
 FOX NEWS, 44.
 ABC NEWS, CBS NEWS, 10.
 THE PRESIDENT HAD CERTAIN NET
 WORKS HE LIKED BETTER THAN
 OTHERS BUT THOSE NUMBERS ARE

 STUNNING.
 IT IS UNBELIEVABLE AND WHAT'S
 GOING TO HAPPEN EVENTUALLY IS
 WE'RE GOING TO GET INTO A
 REELECTION CAMPAIGN.
 IF YOU ADD UP THE VIEWERSHIP,
 HE'S NOW NOT COMMUNICATING TO A
 WHOLE BUNCH OF VOTERS WHO ARE
 SITTING THERE TRYING TO MAKE UP
 THEIR MIND.
 IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO
 FORGET IT.
 GREAT, NOW WE WANT TO BE YOUR
 SPOKESPERSON.
 THERE'S ONE OTHER POINT.
 THE WHITE HOUSE HAS HAD ONE
 PRESS CONFERENCE IN 2019, AND SO
 THEIR PRESS OPERATION IS FOX
 NEWS, THE WAY THEY COMMUNICATE
 IS THROUGH FOX NEWS AND IT'S NOW
 AN EXTENSION OF THE WHITE HOUSE.
 AND DONALD TRUMP HAS 38% IR
 REDUCIBLE CORE, INCREDIBLY HIGH
 FLOOR, AND INCREDIBLY LOW
 CEILING.
 HE'S ONLY TALKING TO HIS
 BASE.
 THAT IS AN INCREDIBLY
 INTERESTING CONVERSATION.
 AFTER THIS BREAK, WE HAVE TO DO
 A COMMERCIAL HERE.
 THE LEAKS ARE COMING FROM INSIDE
 THE WHITE HOUSE.
 NOT JUST INSIDE THE HOUSE,
 INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE.
 THE OBJECTION THE CONGRESSIONAL
 SCRUTINY MAY HAVE BEEN IN VAIN.
 THAT'S COMING UP NEXT.
                       N VAIN THAT'S COMING UP NEXT.
            -Oh, n-no.
     -Look, [Sighs] I get it.
       Some new guy comes in
 helping your mom bundle and save         with Progressive,
             but hey,    we're all in this together.
           Right, champ?
    -I'm getting more nuggets.
     -How about some carrots?
          You don't want       to ruin your dinner.
        -You're not my dad!
           -That's fair.
           Overstepped.
 WE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF A GUT PUNCH FOR THE WHITE HOUSE.
 THE ADMINISTRATION DREW A LINE
 IN THE SAND REFUSING THE REQUEST
 FOR DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE
 SAGA OF JARED KUSHNER'S SECURITY
 CLEARANCE.
 AS IT TURNS OUT THE COMMITTEE
 MAY HAVE HAD THOSE DOCUMENTS ALL
 ALONG.
 AXIOS IS REPORTING THAT SOMEONE
 INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE HAD
 ALREADY LEAKED THEM TO CONGRESS.
 NOT ONLY IS THE LEAK GOING TO BE
 PROBLEMATIC FOR TEAM TRUMP.
 THEY'RE EVIDENTLY RECKONING WITH
 THE LEAKER AS WELL, ONE WHO HAS
 MOVED BY SCOOPS TO JOURNALISTS
 AND HANDING SCOOPS TO CONGRESS.
 WHY IT MATTERS, QUOTE, THE TRUMP
 ADMINISTRATION'S PROBLEMS WITH
 LEAKS WILL NOW BENEFIT CONGRESS
 MAKING IT HARDER FOR THE WHITE
 HOUSE TO WITHHOLD INFORMATION
 FROM DEMOCRATIC INVESTIGATORS.
 JOINING US NOW AT THE TABLE WITH
 MY OTHER TWO FRIENDS, REVEREND
 AL SHARPTON, THE HOST OF
 POLITICS NATION HERE ON MSNBC.
 GOOD TO SEE YOU.
 GOOD TO SEE YOU.
 PHIL, I WANT TO START BY
 ASKING YOU THIS QUESTION, IF THE
 HOUSE COMMITTEE ALREADY HAD
 THESE DOCUMENTS, WHY ARE THEY
 ASKING FOR THEM?
 WELL, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW.
 IT MIGHT BE THAT THEY'RE TRYING
 TO GET MORE DOCUMENTS,
 ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION ON THE
 SAME TOPIC.
 IT MIGHT BE THAT THEY'RE TRYING
 TO FORMALIZE THEIR REQUEST
 BECAUSE THEY OBTAINED THE
 DOCUMENTS NOT THROUGH SORT OF
 THE FRONT DOOR OF THE WHITE
 HOUSE.
 RIGHT.
 I'M NOT SURE.
 ONE THING WE SHOULD KEEP IN MIND
 IS THIS SEEMS TO BE ONLY THE
 BEGINNING OF THE HOUSE DEMOCRATS
 INVESTIGATIONS INTO IVANKA TRUMP
 AND JARED KUSHNER, THERE ARE
 DISCUSSIONS UNDERWAY ABOUT

 LAUNCHING PROBES INTO A NUMBER
 OF OTHER WAYS, INCLUDING IF
 IVANKA TRUMP ENRICHED HERSELF
 AND HER COMPANY USING HER
 POSITION AS A GOVERNMENT
 EMPLOYEE.
 WHAT'S MORE PROBLEMATIC, THE
 FACT THAT THE DOCUMENTS WERE
 LEAKED AND WHAT'S IN THEM OR THE
 FACT THAT THE WHITE HOUSE HAS A
 MOLE WILLING TO COUGH UP THE
 DOCUMENTS TO DEMOCRATIC
 INVESTIGATORS.
 THE THING THAT ALWAYS
 SEPARATES AN INVESTIGATION THAT
 PRODUCES DAMAGING REVELATIONS,
 MAYBE E-MAILS THAT SHOW
 MISCONDUCT OR INAPPROPRIATE
 LANGUAGE, AND THE ONES THAT ARE
 TRULY EXPLOSIVE, THE ONES THAT
 BECOME FRONT PAGE NEWS AND LEAD
 TO RESIGNATIONS AND DEPARTURES,
 THE DIFFERENCE IS WHISTLE
 BLOWERS, IT'S WHEN YOU HAVE A
 WHISTLE BLOWER THAT CAN COME
 FORWARD AND TELL CONGRESSIONAL
 INVESTIGATORS WHERE TO LOOK,
 WHAT QUESTIONS THEY OUGHT TO BE
 ASKING AND SECOND OF ALL, TO
 TAKE AWAY ONE OF THE WHITE
 HOUSES MOST POWERFUL WEAPONS,
 WHICH IS THE ABILITY TO DELAY
 TURNING OVER DOCUMENTS AND TO
 FIGHT IT IN COURT.
 IF THEY CAN GET THE DOCUMENTS
 FROM A WHISTLE BLOWER, IT TAKES
 AWAY THE ABOUT TO DRAG OUT FOR
 MONTHS AND YEARS, AND GETS RIGHT
 TO THE HEART OF THE MANNER, AND
 THE FINAL THING IT GIVES YOU IS
 SOMETIMES A FACE TO PUT IN A
 CONGRESSIONAL HEARING, AND IT'S
 EXTREMELY DAMAGING FOR AN
 ADMINISTRATION.
 A LOT OF NODDING HEADS,
 EVERYONE IS ABOUT TO JUMP OUT OF
 THEIR SKINS.
 JENNIFER GO.
 EVERYTHING HE SAID, YES, I
 WOULD ALSO SAY THIS, THERE ARE A
 LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD A
 PENT UP DESIRE TO TELL WHAT THEY
 HAVE TO SAY.
 THEY HAVE NOT HAD A DEMOCRATIC
 CONGRESS, AND NOW THEY HAVE ONE.
 THEY HAVE SOMEONE TO GIVE THE
 INFORMATION TO.
 SO AGAIN, THE MOST IMPORTANT
 THING THAT HAS HAPPENED IN THIS
 ADMINISTRATION WAS THE CHANGE IN
 CONGRESS.
 I THINK ONE OF THE OTHER ISSUES
 THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE HERE IS,
 YOU KNOW, THESE TWO WERE NOT
 SUCH POPULAR CHILDREN IN THE
 WHITE HOUSE.
 THEY WERE GIVEN HUGE, VAST, YOU
 KNOW, AREAS OF EXPERTISE FOR
 WHICH THEY HAD NO EXPERIENCE.
 THEY ABSOLUTELY, FROM WHAT WE
 HAVE SEEN, USED THESE
 OPPORTUNITIES TO FURTHER
 THEMSELVES.
 THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO I
 AM SURE RESENT THIS, AND THEY
 ARE MORE THAN HAPPY TO CHITCHAT,
 AND THE NOTION THAT THE
 DEMOCRATS SHOULD BE AFRAID OF
 GOING AFTER THE CHILDREN, THE
 CHILDREN ARE THERE BECAUSE OF
 NEPOTISM, BECAUSE OF CONFLICTS
 OF INTEREST, OF COURSE YOU HAVE
 TO GO AFTER THEM.
 GUYS, COME ON, GROW A SPINE.
 YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY.
 PHIL GAVE YOU TWO GOOD
 REASONS, LET ME GIVE YOU THE
 THIRD, THE FORMER GUY WHO TRIED
 TO PLUG THE LEAKS IN THE WHITE
 HOUSE.
 I REMEMBER THAT.
 YOU USED TO DO THAT
 OCCASIONALLY.
 WE'LL HAVE A WHOLE SHOW ABOUT
 THAT.
 THEY DON'T WANT TO SAY WHO GAVE
 IT TO THEM, RIGHT, ESPECIALLY
 THIS DOCUMENT, TO MATT'S POINT,
 THIS DOCUMENT ONLY FIVE OR SIX
 PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
 SEE.
 THIS IS A REALLY EXCLUSIVE
 DOCUMENT AND IT'S GOING TO BE
 PRETTY OBVIOUS WHO GAVE IT TO
 CONGRESS.
 I'M SURE CONGRESS IS LIKE LET'S
 GO GET IT THE OFFICIAL CHANNEL
 SO IT'S NOT OBVIOUS JOE GAVE US
 THIS THING.
 WHEN THESE THINGS ARE LEAKING,
 HOUSTON, YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.
 I WANT TO COME BACK TO THE
 POINT, JENNIFER GOES TO THE
 QUESTION OF CAN YOU GO TOO FAR,
 AND THE QUESTION OF THE KIDS.
 I WANT TO READ FROM THIS
 "WASHINGTON POST" PIECE OF WHICH
 RUCKER IS ONE OF THE COAUTHORS.
 HOUSE DEMOCRATS ARE TORN, AN
 AREA OF INQUIRY THAT WOULD
 INFLAME TENSIONS WITH TRUMP.
 HIGHLIGHT THE CONCERN AMONG SOME
 DEMOCRATS ABOUT THE POLITICAL
 OPTICS OF QUESTIONING TRUMP'S
 ADULT CHILDREN, EVEN AS THEY B
 CYST THE PRESIDENT -INSIST THE
 PRESIDENT'S FAMILY MEMBERS
 ESPECIALLY THOSE SERVING IN
 GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT BE IMMUNE
 FROM ACCOUNTABILITY.
 JENNIFER SAID NO ONE SHOULD HAVE
 HESITANCY ABOUT THIS, YOUR SENSE
 IS IN FACT AMONG DEMOCRATS THERE
 IS SOME DEGREE OF DIVISION AND
 DISSENSION OVER EXACTLY HOW FAR
 TO PUSH.
 TALK ABOUT THAT.
 I THINK IT'S LESS OVER A
 DIVIDE ABOUT WHETHER TO
 INVESTIGATE OR IT'S HOW HARD AND
 HOW TO DO IT, WHAT'S THAT TIME
 LINE LIKE.
 DO YOU SUBPOENA THEM, DO YOU
 CALL THEM FORWARD TO TESTIFY.
 DO YOU START SLOWLY.
 THEY'RE JUST AWARE OF THE
 OPTICS.
 THESE ARE NOT CHILDREN.
 THEY'RE NOT TEENAGERS.
 THEY'RE NOT NAIVE AND INVOLVED
 IN POLITICS.
 THEY ARE WORKING IN GOVERNMENT
 AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS AND
 OVERSEEING IN THE CASE OF JARED
 KUSHNER, OUR COUNTRY'S NATIONAL
 SECURITY, AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS,
 AND SO THEY'RE VERY MUCH, YOU
 KNOW, SUBJECT TO CONGRESSIONAL
 OVERSIGHT.
 REVEREND AL, I WANT TO ASK
 YOU THIS QUESTION, AND READ A
 QUOTE FROM NANCY PELOSI THAT
 AGREES PRETTY MUCH JENNIFER
 REUBEN, NANCY PELOSI AGREE,
 SOMETHING MUST BE RIGHT.
 WHOMEVER FALLS INTO THAT NET
 FALLS INTO THAT NET.
 THEY ARE ADVISERS TO THE
 PRESIDENT.
 THEY HAVE SECURITY CLEARANCES,
 THIS IS NOT THEIR CHILDREN AT
 HOME.
 AND I THINK THAT WAS CRITICAL
 HERE.
 YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE THAT
 WERE GIVING A SECURITY
 CLEARANCE.
 YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS.
 YOU CAN'T PLAY THAT I'M DADDY'S
 LITTLE DAUGHTER AND MY HUSBAND,
 BUT I'VE GOT ALL OF THIS KIND OF
 SECURITY CLEARANCE, ALL THIS
 KIND OF OF INFLUENCE.
 YOU'RE EITHER ONE OR THE OTHER.
 BUT I THINK THAT WHAT CAUSED A
 LOT OF NERVOUSNESS AROUND THE
 WHITE HOUSE, WHEN YOU HEAR ABOUT
 SOMEBODY LEAKING IS THEY DON'T
 KNOW WHAT ELSE THEY LEAKED AND
 WHAT MAY BE THE QUESTIONING IF
 THEY'RE CALLED BEFORE CONGRESS,
 AND IF YOU HAVE PEOPLE AT THE
 HIGHEST LEVEL AS WAS SAID ONLY
 FOUR OR FIVE WOULD KNOW IT.
 YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE THEY
 HAVE, AND YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF
 DEALS THAT THESE PEOPLE HAVE THE
 CAPACITY TO CUT.
 SO I WOULD BE VERY CONCERNED IF
 I WAS THEM TO KNOW PEOPLE AT A
 HIGHER LEVEL ARE GETTING THEM
 THINGS.
 WE KNOW WHAT WE THINK THEY MAY
 HAVE ON SECURITY STUFF.
 YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE HAS
 BEEN LEAKED ABOUT JARED KUSHNER
 AND IVANKA'S POSSIBLE DEALINGS.
 I WILL SAY THE DEMOCRATS,
 THIS IS GOING TO BE A RECURRING
 THEME GOING FORWARD, THAT
 DEMOCRATS ARE ARGUING AND
 WORRIED ABOUT EVERY QUESTION IF
 THEY'RE GOING TO OVERREACH ON
 SPECIFIC THINGS.
 THERE IS ONE AREA I DON'T THINK
 THEY SHOULD WORRY ABOUT.
 PHIL RUCKER, THANK YOU SO MUCH
 FOR BEING ON THE SHOW AS ALWAYS.
 YOU ARE AWESOME.
 AFTER THE BREAK WE'LL HAVE A
 DISCUSSION OF WAITING FOR JOE
 BIDEN TO CHALLENGE DONALD TRUMP,
 IS OUT THE DOOR AND AROUND THE
 CORNER, THE FORMER VICE
 PRESIDENT COULD CHANGE
 EVERYTHING WITH A SNAP OF HIS
 FINGERS.
 HOW LIKELY IS THAT MAN TO RUN
 ACCORDING TO HIM, NEXT.
                         TO RUN ACCORDING TO HIM, NEXT

 THE FIELD OF DEMOCRATIC CONTENDERS FOR 2020 IS AMONG THE
 LARGEST AND MOST DIVERSE THAT WE
 HAVE EVER SEEN.
 THIS WEEK WE SAW MORE PEOPLE
 COME OUT AND SAY THEY WON'T RUN
 THAN THOSE WHO SAY THEY WILL.
 ONE PROMINENT DEMOCRAT WHO
 WEIGHED IN ON THE CROWDED FIELD
 IS NEW YORK CITY MAYOR BILL DE
 BLASIO.
 HE WEIGHED IN WITH ME WHEN I SAT
 DOWN WITH HIM THIS WEEK.
 TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
 THIS WEEK, YOUR PREDECESSOR
 MICHAEL BLOOMBERG DECIDES NOT TO
 RUN.
 YOU COULD ARGUE THERE'S NOT A
 SINGLE HUMAN BEING IN THE
 DEMOCRATIC PARTY WHO HAS DONE
 MORE ON CLIMATE AND GUNS THAN
 MIKE.

 AND YET DESPITE ALL OF THAT, HE
 WITH HIS MONEY AND POLITICAL
 BRAINS AROUND HIM, ALL THOSE
 PEOPLE, THEY ALL LOOK TO THE
 STATE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY
 RIGHT NOW AND SAID, HE HAS NO
 CHANCE TO BE THE NOMINEE.
 SO FIRST OF ALL, DO YOU THINK
 THAT'S RIGHT?

 HE HAD NO CHANCE?
 NO CHANCE.
 BECAUSE WE'RE A PROGRESSIVE
 PARTY MORE AND MORE THAT IS
 DESPERATELY TROUBLED BY THE
 WEALTH AND POWER CONCENTRATED IN
 THE HANDS OF 1%.
 AND WE KNOW THAT HAS TO CHANGE
 AND IT HAS TO CHANGE QUICKLY, SO
 HOW ON EARTH ARE YOU GOING TO
 NOMINATE ONE OF THE EIGHT
 RICHEST MEN IN THE WORLD.
 THAT IS NOT SOMEONE WHO'S GOING
 TO CHANGE THAT REALITY.
 A PLUTOCRAT IS NOT GOING TO
 WIN.

 SO HE MADE THE RIGHT DECISION.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 IS JOE BIDEN A PROGRESSIVE OR
 A MODERATE?
 JOE BIDEN, FIRST OF ALL, A
 VERY IMPRESSIVE PUBLIC SERVANT,
 BUT, I CERTAINLY CONSIDER HIM A
 MODERATE.
 SO CAN'T BE THE NOMINEE?
 I DON'T THINK THIS PARTY IS
 GOING TO CHOOSE A MODERATE.
 I DON'T THINK THIS PARTY SHOULD
 CHOOSE A MODERATE.
 IF A MODERATE RUNS AND WINS,
 THIS VERY DANGEROUS STATUS QUO
 WILL CONTINUE.
 WE HAVE AN INCOME AND EQUALITY
 CRISIS THAT IS DANGEROUS AND
 DESTABLING.
 BUT YOU HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT
 FOR JOE BIDEN AS A PUBLIC
 SERVANT.

 WE COULD SAY HE WOULD NOT WIN
 THE DE BLASIO ENFORCEMENT.
 HE'S A MODERATE.
 LOOK, I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT
 TO HIM, BUT IF YOU SAY WHAT DOES
 THIS PARTY NEED RIGHT NOW, IT
 DOESN'T NEED A MODERATE.
 WHAT DOES THIS COUNTRY NEED, IT
 DOESN'T NEED A MODERATE.
 AND HE'S A MODERATE.
 SO BILL DE BLASIO WHO HIMSELF
 IS THINKING ABOUT RUNNING FOR
 PRESIDENT, HEADING TO SOUTH
 CAROLINA THIS WEEKEND, HE'S BEEN
 IN IOWA.
 WHO KNOWS HOW REAL THAT IS, BUT
 HE'S THE VERY LIBERAL MAYOR OF
 THE BIGGEST CITY IN AMERICA, AND
 HAS HAD A SUCCESSFUL RUN HERE.
 HE'S GOING TO HAVE A ROLE.
 HIS ENDORSEMENT IS GOING TO
 MATTER.
 HE SAID JOE BIDEN SHOULD NEVER
 GET NOMINATED.
 HE SAYS JOE BIDEN PROBABLY
 SHOULDN'T RUN EITHER BECAUSE
 THIS PARTY IS SO FAR TO THE LEFT
 NOW THAT THERE'S NO WAY THAT JOE
 BIDEN COULD GET NOMINATED IS
 THAT RIGHT?
 NO, I UNDERSTAND THE ARGUMENT
 BUT IT'S NOT TRUE.
 60% OF THE DEMOCRATS SAY THE
 MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE IS WHO CAN
 BEAT DONALD TRUMP.
 DONALD TRUMP IS A UNIFYING
 FACTOR.
 YOU REMEMBER IN 2004, WE DANCED
 WITH HOWARD DEAN, AND JOHN
 EDWARDS AND KERRY CAN BEAT BUSH
 AND WE'RE GOING TO KERRY.
 THE SECOND THING IS THERE'S NO
 MAJOR FRONT RUNNER IN THIS RACE
 BIDEN INCLUDED BUT THE THOUGHT
 THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE
 MOST PROGRESSIVE CANDIDATE IS
 PROBABLY NOT TRUE.
 THE OTHER THING IS AS YOU HAVE
 COVERED, SEVEN STATES HAVE GONE
 FROM CAUCUSES TO OPEN PRIMARIES
 IN THE 2020 ELECTION, WHICH IS
 GOING TO OPEN IT UP TO A MUCH
 BIGGER GROUP OF PEOPLE INCLUDING
 INDEPENDENTS AND REPUBLICANS IN
 A DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY AND LIKELY
 GO TO ELECTING OR NOMINATING A
 MORE ELECTABLE CANDIDATE IN THE
 GENERAL ELECTION.
 YOU RAN IN 2004.
 YOU WERE PRETTY PROGRESSIVE
 CANDIDATE IF I REMEMBER
 CORRECTLY, MORE IN LINE WITH THE
 MAINSTREAM WHERE THE PARTY IS
 NOW THAN IT WAS IN 2004, DO YOU
 THINK THAT A JOE BIDEN RUNNING
 PRIMARILY IN THE WAY THAT JIM
 SUGGESTS WHICH NOT GOING TO BE
 ON THE FAR LEFT OF THE PARTY,
 HE'S NOT GOING TO BE THE
 PROGRESSIVE MAINSTREAM BUT HE'S
 GOING TO RUN LARGELY ON I'M
 GOING TO TAKE OUT DONALD TRUMP.
 IS HE GOING TO MAKE A BIG
 DIFFERENCE?
 I THINK I AGREE THAT THE
 PARTY HAS MOVED TOWARD THE LEFT,
 BUT I THINK THE OVERWHELMING
 MAJORITY OF PEOPLE THAT ARE
 GOING TO VOTE IN THESE PRIMARIES
 ARE GOING TO WANT SOMEONE THAT
 CAN BEAT DONALD TRUMP, AND I
 THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, I TALKED
 TO A LOT OF MY PROGRESSIVE
 FRIENDS AND I'M CONSIDERED
 PROGRESSIVE, THAT YOU CAN
 ELIMINATE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN
 THIS.
 MANY OF THE PROGRESSIVE
 CANDIDATES DO NOT ENERGIZE BLACK
 VOTERS AND DO NOT ENERGIZE BROWN
 VOTERS.
 IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE
 RESULTS, THEY LOSE THE BLACK
 VOTE.
 ACCORDING TO THE MAP AND THE
 CALENDAR, YOU GO FROM IOWA TO
 NEW HAMPSHIRE TO SOUTH CAROLINA,
 SOUTH CAROLINA IS NOT A STATE
 THAT'S GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR
 THE MOST PROGRESSIVE.
 IT'S A STATE WITH A LOT OF BLACK
 VOTERS AND YOUR SUPER LEFT GUY
 CAN DIE THERE IF THEY DON'T KNOW
 HOW TO DEAL WITH ISSUES LIKE
 THAT THAT JOE BIDEN DOES KNOW
 HOW TO DEAL THAT.
 I'M NOT SAYING HE WINS SOUTH
 CAROLINA, BUT I'M SAYING THAT
 YOU BETTER LOOK AT MAP IF YOU'RE
 ON YOUR WAY TO WINNING THE
 NOMINATION.
 THIS MORNING, ON THIS AIR, ON
 MORNING JOE, YOU HAD JOHN
 HICKENLOOPER, A SELF-E VOWED
 MODERATE, MULTIMILLIONAIRE,
 ENTREPRENEURIAL SUCCESS STORY,
 TAKING OUT THE TURF WHICH IS NOT
 THE PROGRESSIVE LANE BUT ASKED
 ON THE AIR THIS MORNING WHETHER
 HE WAS A CAPITALIST COULD NOT
 COME OUT AND SAY I'M A
 CAPITALIST.
 AGAIN, APPARENTLY AFRAID THAT
 SAYING YOU'RE A CAPITALIST IN
 THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS THE KISS
 OF DEATH.
 WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT WHERE
 THINGS ARE?
 IT SAYS HE'S A BAD CANDIDATE.
 THERE ARE GOOD MODERATE
 CANDIDATES, BAD MODERATE
 CANDIDATES, GOOD PROGRESSIVE,
 BAD PROGRESSIVE.
 ELIZABETH WARREN HAS SAID I'M A
 CAPITALIST, AND THIS IS WHAT WE
 HAVE TO DO FOR CAPITALISM TO
 HAVE A DECENT HUMANE SOCIETY.
 I DON'T THINK
 I DON'T THINK HICKEN HOOPER IS
 THE GUY TO CARRY THE MESSAGE IF
 YOU CAN'T GET THROUGH AN
 INTERVIEW ON HIS SECOND DAY OUT
 OF THE BOX.
 I WOULD ECHO SOMETHING THAT THE
 REVEREND SAID.
 THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, ALTHOUGH
 WE HEAR ABOUT THE MOVE TO THE
 LEFT AND THE PROGRESSIVES, WHEN
 YOU LOOK AT THE CLEAR DATA,
 ALMOST HALF OF THEM CONSIDER
 THEMSELVES TO BE CONSERVATIVES
 OR MODERATES, IT'S NOT LIKE THE
 ENTIRE PARTY HAS BECOME BERNIE
 SANDERS OVERNIGHT.
 AS THE REVEREND SAID,
 YOU ALSO HAVE TO INCLUDE THE
 PEOPLE THAT DESPERATELY WANT TO
 WIN AND ARE TELLING PEOPLE I
 DON'T HAVE TO HAVE MY TOP
 FAVORITE, EXCEPT SOMEONE THAT IS
 GOOD ENOUGH TO WIN.
 I WOULD ALSO ADD THIS.
 SAY THAT JOE BIDEN IS A
 MODERATE, IT REALLY STRIKES ME
 AS PECULIAR.
 THEY ACT LIKE THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WAS SOME
 MODERATE OR
 REPUBLICAN LIGHT OPERATION.
 I'LL TELL YOU THAT BILL
 DEBLASIO AND MORE SAY THAT THE
 OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WAS NOT
 PROGRESSIVE ENOUGH AND BILL
 CLINTON'S CONSERVATIVE.
 WE'LL COME BACK AFTER THIS QUICK
 BREAK.
       IS QUICK BREAK.

 IT IS INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY, SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT
 WE TALK ABOUT ANOTHER ELEMENT OF
 THE RACE, BUT IS IDENTITY.
 WE HAVE A LOT OF STRONG WOMEN
 WHO ARE RUNNING.
 ELIZABETH WARREN IS HERE TALKING
 ABOUT MANY TECH GIANTS, HOW MUCH
 DO YOU THINK BEING A WOMAN IN
 DEMOCRATIC RACE IN 2020 IS
 ITSELF A HUGE ADVANTAGE?
 IT IS A HUGE DEAL, RIGHT?
 THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WOULD LIKE
 TO NOMINATE A WOMAN.
 58% OF DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY VOTERS
 ARE WOMEN IN THESE BATTLEGROUND
 STATES, SO IT'S A BIG ADVANTAGE.
 I AGREE.
 I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
 HAVE A WOMAN ON THE TICKET, IF
 NOT THE NOMINEE.
 I THINK WE HAVE COME TO THE TIME
 IN HISTORY WHERE PEOPLE
 SERIOUSLY WANT TO SEE A WOMAN AT
 THAT LEVEL OF PRESIDENT, AT
 LEAST VICE PRESIDENT.
 ONE POSITIVE, ONE NEGATIVE,
 THE NEGATIVE IS THERE IS A LOT
 OF DEMOCRATS TOTALLY SPOOKED BY
 THE HILLARY LOSS AND WE HAVE TO
 GET A WHITE MAN.
 THAT WAS THE FRENZY OVER SHARED
 BROWN.
 IT'S RIDICULOUS.
 ON THE POSITIVE SIDE, WOMEN BY
 THE GENERAL PUBLIC ARE LOOKED
 UPON AS SAFER BETS.
 THEY DON'T DO SOME OF THE STUFF
 THAT THESE GUYS HAVE BEEN CAUGHT
 DOING.
 THEY BEHAVE THEMSELVES IN PUBLIC
 AND IN PRIVATE, AND IN SOME
 SENSE, IT GIVES A LITTLE BIT
 MORE GRAVITAS, AT LEAST I DON'T
 HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT AT IT
 TAKE WARRIOR.
 -TAKEAWAY.
 MATT MILLER, ONE OF THE
 PIECES OF NEWS THIS WEEK WE
 HEARD IS THAT YOUR OLD BOSS,
 ERIC HOLDER, DECIDED NOT TO RUN.
 ARE YOU DISAPPOINTED HE'S NOT
 RUNNING?
 I THINK HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A
 GREAT PRESIDENT, BUT THERE IS A
 A LOT GOOD CANDIDATES.
 HE DECIDED IT'S A BIG HILL TO
 CLIMB AND A BIG BURDEN TO ASK OF
 YOUR FAMILY.
 AND ULTIMATELY DECIDED IT WASN'T
 THE RIGHT TIME FOR HIM TO DO IT,
 BUT I THINK HE'S GOING TO BE
 STAY PRETTY ACTIVE IN POLITICS.
 I THINK HE IS RUNNING THIS
 REDISTRICTING COALITION AND I
 THINK WE WILL SEE HIM POP UP AT
 SOME POINT.
 REAL QUICK, A LITTLE BIRD
 TOLD ME THAT BETO O'ROURKE WILL
 ANNOUNCE NEXT WEEK.
 BETO O'ROURKE GOING TO BE A
 SIGNIFICANT PLAYER, YES OR NO?
 ABSOLUTELY.
 I THINK HE IS, BUT HE HAS TO
 BROADEN HIS BASE.
 HE CANNOT STAY WHERE HE IS.
 BETO O'ROURKE?
 YES, HE WILL BE, BUT HE NEEDS
 SUBSTANCE AND GRAVITAS.
 YOU GUYS ARE FANTASTIC.
 WHEN YOU SAY SPEED ROUND AT THIS
 TABLE, PEOPLE KNOW WHAT IT
 MEANS.
 WE HAVE ONE MORE BREAK, WE'LL
 TAKE THAT BREAK RIGHT NOW AND BE
 BACK AFTER THAT.
    In a study with Ozempic®,       a majority of adults
    lowered their blood sugar
        and reached an A1C        of less than seven
        and maintained it.
                     Oh!                     Under seven?
     And you may lose weight.
           In the same         one-year study,
      adults lost on average         up to 12 pounds.
 Oh! Up to 12 pounds?
     A two-year study showed
      that Ozempic® does not        increase the risk
  of major cardiovascular events
        like heart attack,        stroke, or death.
 Oh! No increased risk?
    ♪ Oh, oh, oh, Ozempic®! ♪
 Ozempic® should not be the first medicine for treating diabetes,
        or for people with         type 1 diabetes
    or diabetic ketoacidosis.
  Do not share needles or pens.
       Don't reuse needles.
 Do not take Ozempic® if you have   a personal or family history
   of medullary thyroid cancer,
   Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia         Syndrome type 2,
          or if you are      allergic to Ozempic®.
       Stop taking Ozempic® and get medical help right away
  if you get a lump or swelling          in your neck,
  severe stomach pain, itching,
   rash, or trouble breathing.
       Serious side effects           may happen,
     including pancreatitis.
   Tell your doctor if you have       diabetic retinopathy
        or vision changes.
       Taking Ozempic® with    a sulfonylurea or insulin
      may increase the risk       for low blood sugar.
 Common side effects are nausea,
       vomiting, diarrhea,
 stomach pain, and constipation.
        Some side effects     can lead to dehydration,
         which may worsen         kidney problems.
       I discovered the potential       with Ozempic®.

   Ask your healthcare provider  if Ozempic® is right for you.
      My experience with USAA
        has been excellent.
      They really appreciate      the military family
       and it really shows.
     With all that USAA offers
     why go with anybody else?
       We know       their rates are good,
       we know that they're
         always going to         take care of us.
   It was an instant savings and
      I should have changed      a long time ago.
       It was funny because       when we would call
    another insurance company,
      hey would say      “Oh we can't beat USAA”
     We're the Webber family.
        We're the Tenney's
         We're the Hayles,
 and we're USAA members for life.
