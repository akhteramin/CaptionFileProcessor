 ♪ MADE IN HOLLYWOOD ♪ WE ARE BACK WITH THE
 CHOREOGRAPHER FROM "MOANA",
 TIANA LIUFAU.
 CHOREOGRAPHERS WORK WITH THE
 DIRECTOR IN ORDER TO CREATE
 DANCE ROUTINES THAT HELP TELL
 THE STORY OF THE MOVIE.
 TIANA LIUFAU BEGAN DANCING AS
 SOON AS SHE WAS ABLE TO WALK.
 MS. LIUFAU CURRENTLY LEADS A
 TAHITIAN MUSIC AND DANCE COMPANY
 AND HAS BROUGHT TAHITIAN
 CHOREOGRAPHER TO THE TELEVISION
 SHOW "SO YOU THINK YOU CAN
 DANCE."
 DO YOU KNOW WHO MAUI IS?
 ONLY THE GREATEST DEMIGOD IN ALL
 THE PACIFIC ISLANDS.
 WITH HIS MAGICAL FISH HOOK HE
 SLOWS DOWN THE SUN.
 PULLED ISLANDS OUT OF THE SEA.
 BATTLED MONSTERS.
 AND I SHOULD KNOW, BECAUSE I AM
 MAUI.


 HEY.
 LET ME DO THIS, PLEASE.
 ALL RIGHT, SO WE ARE HERE
 WITH TIANA LIUFAU, WHO IS THE
 CHOREOGRAPHER BEHIND "MOANA."
 WHICH IS ACTUALLY REALLY CRAZY
 BECAUSE YOU WOULD NEVER THINK
 THAT THERE WAS AN ACTUAL
 CHOREOGRAPHER THAT WAS BROUGHT
 YOU, YOU JUST THINK MAYBE THE
 ANIMATERS DID IT.
 RIGHT.
 I ACTUALLY NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT
 AS WELL, BUT I AM EXTREMELY
 HUMBLED AND GRATEFUL THAT THEY
 DID, BECAUSE IT'S SUCH AN
 IMPORTANT FACET OF OUR CULTURE.
 HOW DID THAT COME ABOUT?
 I ACTUALLY WAS BROUGHT IN TO
 THE DISNEY TEAM THROUGH D23 EXPO
 AND I CHOREOGRAPHED THE THEME
 SONG WE KNOW THE WAY.
 ♪ WE KNOW THE WAY ♪
 AND THEN COME THIS YEAR
 JANUARY, I WAS BROUGHT IN TO
 BRING WEAPONS FOR A SONG.


 ♪ ALSO I LAUGH SEE THE SUN COMES
 TO STRETCH THE DAYS AND BRING
 YOU FUN ♪
 I DID THAT AND IT EVENTUALLY
 LED TO OTHER SONGS AND OTHER
 SCENES AND I JUST HAVE BEEN
 REALLY BLESSED TO BE A PART OF
 THIS.
 WHAT IS THAT LIKE, THEN, DO
 THEY BRING NUTS TO STUDIO AND
 SAY, OKAY, DANCE?
 [ LAUGHTER ]
 AND THEN ANIMATE YOUR MOVES
 IN.
 KIND OF.
 I IMMEDIATE WITH THE TEAM AND
 THEY EXPLAIN EVERYTHING, THE
 MEANING BEHIND IT, SET UP THE
 SCENE SO I UNDERSTAND, GIVE ME
 REFERENCES AND BOARDS LIKE A
 COMIC STRIP AND I GET TO TAKE IT
 AND THE MUSIC AND THEN I GET TO
 BE IN MY ELEMENT.
 IN MY OWN CREATIVE SPACE.
 AND THEN I CREATE A DANCE TO THE
 WHOLE SONG, AND I COME BACK AND
 I EXPLAIN TO THEM WHAT EACH
 MOTION MEANS, HOW I WAS
 INSPIRED, AND THEN I PERFORM IT
 OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER.
 LIVE, WITH THE ANIMATERS HERE.
 AND IF THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS,
 OR THEY WANT TO SEE DIFFERENT
 ANGLES I HAVE DO IT ON THE SPOT.
 HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO YOU
 COME UP WITH THE CHOREOGRAPHY.
 IS IT HARD?
 I.
 I THINK IT'S HARD BECAUSE YOU
 WILL BE YOUR WORST CRITIC,
 HOWEVER, I THINK FOR ME, IT'S
 DIFFERENT, BECAUSE I CONNECT
 WITH THE MUSIC AND THE
 VIBRATIONS AND THE LYRICS, SO
 DIFFERENTLY, IT 1350EBGZ TO ME
 DIFFERENT SO IT COMES YOU THE OF
 MY LIMBS DIFFERENT AND THEN I
 ALSO HAVE TO REMEMBER THE STORY
 THAT I AM TRYING TO PORTRAY OR
 IF MY ANCESTORS WERE TO WATCH
 THIS IF THEY WOULD BE APPROVING
 OF THIS.
 SO IT'S DIFFICULT IN MANY
 DIFFERENT WAYS BUT THERE IS
 SOMETHING IN OUR CULTURE WE CALL
 THE UT-OH AND NO OWE OH IF YOU
 WERE RAISED IN THE CULTURE AND
 YOU LIVED IT, AND YOU CAN SPEAKD
 UNDERSTAND IT KIND OF COMES
 NATURALLY.
 I THINK THE ANCESTORS CHANNEL
 THROUGH YOU.
 I WILL HAVE SOME OF MY DANCERS
 COME OUT.
 HI.
 MY BACK IS --
 PRETTY MUCH.
 I FEEL LIKE J-LO, YOU GUYS.
 WE WILL DO THE FIRST MOTION,
 WE GOING TO DO IS THE "MOANA."
 THE "MOANA."
 THAT'S A GOOD PLACE TO START.
 DO OUR HANDS MIMICKING OF THE
 OCEAN.
 AND WE'LL SWITCH TO THE LEFT.
 AND WE ARE GOING ADD OUR HIPS
 SIDE TO SIDE WITH THE ROLLING OF
 THE OCEAN OR THE WAVES.
 AND THEN MAKE A BIG CIRCLE AND
 THE HAPPENS ARE MAKING THE SHAPE
 OF THE ISLAND WITH OUR HIPS AND
 THEN WE ARE GOING TO DO THE
 PADDLING OF THE CANOE FRONT,
 BACK.
 HERE WE GO.
 THIS IS --
 BACK.
 FRONT.
 BACK.
 LET'S PUT IT ALTOGETHER WITH THE
 DRUMS.
 FIVE, SIX, FIVE, SIX, SEVEN,
