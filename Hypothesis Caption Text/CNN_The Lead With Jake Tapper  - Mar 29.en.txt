With moderate to severe Crohn's disease, I was there, jt not always where I needed to be. Is she alright? I hope so. So I talked to my doctor about HUMIRA. I learned HUMIRA is for people who still have symptoms of Crohn's disease after trying other mications. And the majority of people on HUMIRA saw significant symptom relief and many achieved remission in as little as 4 weeks. <i> HU■■■■■&ability</i> <i> to fight infections,</i> <i> including tuberculosis.</i> <i> Serious, sometimes fatal</i> <i> infections and cancers,</i> <i> including lymphoma, happen,</i> <i> and nervous system problems,</i> <i> serious allergic reactions,</i> <i> and new or worsening</i> <i> heart failure.</i> <i> Before treatment,</i> <i> get tested for TB.</i> ■ou 've been to areas <i>where certain fungal infections</i> <i> are common,</i> <i> and if you've had TB,</i> <i> hepatitis B,</i> <i>are prone to infections, or have</i> <i> flu-like symptoms or sores.</i> <i> Don't start HUMIRA</i> <i> if you have an infection.</i> Be there for you, and them.

When it comes to type 2 diabetes, are you thinking about your heart? Well, I'm managing my A1C, so I should be all set. Right. Actually, you're still at risk for a fatal heart attack or stroke. Even if I'm taking heart medicine, like statins or blood thinners? Yep! That's why I asked my doctor what else I could do... she told me about JARDIANCE. That's right. JARDIANCE significantly reduces the risk of dying from a cardiovascular event for adults who have type 2 diabetes and known heart disease. That's why the American Diabetes Association recommends the active ingredient in JARDIANCE. And it lowers A1C? Yeah
- with diet and exercise. <i> JARDIANCE can cause</i> <i> serious side effects</i> <i> including dehydration,</i> <i>genital yeast or </i> <i>urinary tract infections,</i> <i> Ketoacidosis is a serious</i> <i> side effect</i> <i> that may be fatal.</i> <i> A rare, but life-threatening,</i> <i> bacterial infection</i> <i>in the skin of the perineum</i> <i> could occur.</i> <i> Stop taking JARDIANCE</i> <i>and call your doctor right away</i> <i> if you have symptoms</i> <i> of this bacterial infection,</i> <i> ketoacidosis,</i> <i> or an allergic reaction.</i> <i> Do not take JARDIANCE</i> <i> if you are on dialysis</i> <i>or have severe kidney problems.</i> <i> Taking JARDIANCE</i> <i> with a sulfonylurea</i> <i> or insulin may cause</i> <i> low gar.</i> So, what do you think?
