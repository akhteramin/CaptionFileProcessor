 WENT KNOCKING DOWN TREES AND KNOCKING OUT POWER.
 THE STORMS WERE INTENSE.
 WE WILL FIND OUT IF WE ARE IN
 THE CLEAR.
 OUR METEOROLOGIST IS WITH US
 NOW, ALYSSA I HAVE THE FEELING
 THE ANSWER IS NO.
 YOU ARE GUESSING RIGHT, THE
 STORM GAME IS GOING STRONG, AT
 11:00 TONIGHT YOU CAN SEE THE
 PROGRESSION OF THE STORMS OVER
 THE LAST FIVE HOURS AND IN THE
 LAST HOUR, WE ARE TRACKING
 ANOTHER INTENSE THUNDERSTORM,
 OVER SOUTHERN MARYLAND, GOING
 TO CHARLES COUNTY AND NO MOVING
 INTO ST. MARY'S COUNTY.
 MECHANICSVILLE HAD A LOT OF
 HEAVY RAIN AND ABOUT 20 THINK
 STRIKES IN THE LAST TEN MINUTES
 ALONE, THIS IS ONE LAST STORM
 OF THE NIGHT, MOVING TOWARD
 LEXINGTON PARK AT 11:36.
 IT WILL HOLD TOGETHER, OVER
 MARYLAND, IT WILL REACH AT
 ABOUT MIDNIGHT TONIGHT.
 TOMORROW WE HAVE ANOTHER ROUND
 OF STORMS.
 TOMORROW I THINK THE GREATER
 OVERALL THREAT IS GOING TO END
 UP BEING SOME VERY HEAVY RAIN
 FALLING ON SATURATED GROUND,
 THAT COULD LEAD TO ISSUES, WITH
 AN ISOLATED STORM THAT COULD
 BECOME STRONG OR SEVERE.
 NOT AS MANY IS WHAT WE SAW
 TODAY, BUT STORMS TOMORROW WILL
 STILL BE INTENSE.
 WE START WITH PATCHY FOG.
 WE WILL TAKE THE FUTURE CAST
 OUT TILL NOON.
 WE ARE MOSTLY DRY ON THE FUTURE
 CASS, BUT STARTING IN THE
 AFTERNOON, THE NEXT ROUND OF
 STORMS STARTS FIRING UP.
 WHEN IT STARTS GOING, IT WILL
 ONLY GET MORE INTENSE FROM
 THERE.
 WE WILL TAKE YOU THROUGH THE
 REST OF THE FUTURE CAST.
 WE WILL BE LOOKING AHEAD UNTIL
 THE NEXT STREAK OF DRY DAYS,
 NEXT.
 THANK YOU, MELISSA.
 AND THIS SHOULD COME AS NO
 SURPRISE, STORMS LEFT BEHIND
 DAMAGE IN THE AREA TONIGHT.
 CHECK OUT THIS HUGE TREE THAT
 BRUSHED AGAINST THIS HOUSE ON
 RESERVOIR ROAD, RIGHT BEFORE
 FALLING OVER.

 INJURIES TONIGHT.
 IN GLOVER PARK, THIS TREE
 SNAPPED AND FELL RIGHT ONTO
 THAT PARKED SUV, SOME OF THE
 OTHER CARS NEARBY MAY HAVE BEEN
 DAMAGED AS WELL.
 AND CHECK THIS OUT.
 ALSO IN THE DISTRICT, ANOTHER
 TREE CRASHES ONTO A CAR, YOU
 CAN'T REALLY SEE THE CAR
 BECAUSE THAT TREE IS SO BIG.
 THIS HAPPENED ON NEW HAMPSHIRE
 AVENUE.

 WEATHER PICTURES COMING IN
 TONIGHT FROM THROUGHOUT THE

 POWERFUL ENOUGH TO BE FELT FOR
 MILES AROUND.
 WE FOUND PEOPLE SCATTERED
 ALL ABOUT THE DEBRIS AREA.

 JOIN BENEDICT, CBS NEWS,
 PASADENA, CALIFORNIA.
 GAVIN NEWSOM DECLARED A
 STATE OF EMERGENCY, FOR
 SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, THERE WAS
 SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE AFTER FRIDAY
 NIGHTS EARTHQUAKE.
 AND MELISSA IS WITH US TONIGHT,
 IT HAS BEEN A BUSY NIGHT, AND
 IT IS STILL NOT OVER.
 ONE STORM IS LEFT OUT THERE, WE
 GET TO DO IT ALL AGAIN
 TOMORROW, AS IF YOU ARE NOT
 DONE WITH IT ALREADY.
 LOOK AT THE TOWER CAMERA, NICE
 AND DRY OVER THESE RIGHT NOW.
 AND WINDY GUST REAGAN NATIONAL,
 AS THE STORMS ARE COMING
 THROUGH, IT WAS JUST ABOUT 40
 MILES PER HOUR.
 AT THE CAPITAL, IT WAS 66,
 THERE ARE DOZENS, I'M NOT
 KIDDING, 66 AT THE US CAPITOL.
 IT CAN HAPPEN.
 WE WILL LEAVE IT THERE.
 THERE WERE DOZENS OF TREES DOWN
 ALL OVER DC.
 WE HAD 5000 PEOPLE WITHOUT
 POWER, 4000 PEOPLE IN PRINCE
 GEORGES COUNTY, AND LET ME SHOW
 YOU THE LAST REMAINING STORM,
 WITH STILL A LOT OF LIGHTNING,
 AND I PUT A LIGHTNING TRACKER
 ON THIS.
 THIS STORM IS HOLDING TOGETHER
 WELL, WITH HEAVY RAIN MOVING
 INTO LEONARD WITH 45 STRIKES,
 IN THE LAST TEN MINUTES ALONE.
 HERE IS THE SET UP, THIS FRONT
 IS TRYING TO MOVE THROUGH, IT
 IS GOING TO STALL OUT OVER THE
 AREA, TOMORROW.
 THAT FRONT IS THE DIVIDING LINE
 BE DUE BETWEEN THIS DISGUSTING
 HUMID AIR MASS THAT WE HAVE
 BEEN IN, AND NOT EXACTLY
 CANADIAN PLEASANTRY, BUT IT
 WILL BE A LITTLE UNMANAGEABLE
 OUTSIDE BY TUESDAY.
 WE ARE IN THE TRANSITION FOR
 SUNDAY AND MONDAY, WITH STILL
 SOME STORM CHANCES.
 I PULLED UP THE WEATHER MODEL,
 OVER THE NEXT 48 HOURS ALONE,
 LOOK AT THIS.
 WE HAVE THE IN-HOUSE RPM MODEL
 SHOWING ANOTHER THREE AND A
 HALF INCHES AND SOME ISOLATED
 SPOTS.
 THIS IS SHOWING A HEAVY
 RAINFALL THREAT, SETTING UP FOR
 TOMORROW.
 AND TOMORROW'S STORMS COULD
 BRING LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN, THAT
 IS MY BIGGEST CONCERN OF ALL OF
 THE STORM THREATS.
 WE COULD HAVE ISOLATED STRONG
 TO SEVERE STORMS LIKE WE SAW
 TODAY, NOT AS MANY, WITH SOME
 DAMAGING WIND.
 I
 THINK THE OVERALL THREAT WILL
 BE SOME DOWNPOURS FALLING ON
 SATURATED GROUND, THAT COULD
 LEAD TO FLOODING.
 WE WILL ALSO SEE SOME
 LIGHTNING.
 IF YOU ARE BOATING OR HIKING
 OUTSIDE, OR ENJOYING LUNCH,
 HEADS UP FOR THE STORMS, YOU
 DON'T WANT TO BE CAUGHT OUTSIDE
 WITH THEM.
 HOURLY, AFTER TODAY'S STORMS I
 THINK WE WILL SEE SOME FOG
 FORMING OVERNIGHT.
 SOME OF THAT FOG COULD BE
 LOCALLY DANCE.
 WE WILL START WITH CLOUD COVER,
 PATCHY FOG, TEMPERATURES IN THE
 70s.
 BY LUNCHTIME THERE IS STILL A
 LITTLE BIT OF CLOUD COVER, IT
 WILL BREAK UP A LITTLE BIT.
 TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE 80s, WE
 GO UNTIL THREE A CLOCK IN THE
 AFTERNOON, THIS IS HOW WE START
 TO SEE SOME SCATTERED STORMS
 DEVELOPING.
 I THINK THE STORM TIMEFRAME
 TOMORROW IS LATER THAN IT WAS
 TODAY.
 STORMS WILL START AROUND MIDDLE
 AFTERNOON, REALLY RAMPING UP
 PAST DINNERTIME AND EVENING.
 A LOT OF COMPUTER MODELS ARE
 GOING TO KEEP STORMS IN THE
 FORECAST THROUGHOUT SUNDAY
 NIGHT AND EVEN INTO MONDAY
 MORNING.
 WITH A LOT OF HEAVY STORMS THAT
 KEEP RINGING ROUNDS OF HEAVY
 RAIN INTO THE AREA.
 I THINK TOMORROW IS GOING TO BE
 A BIGGER FLOODING THREAT
 LOCALLY, ESPECIALLY CREEK AND
 STREAM FLOODING, RISING.
 WE START WITH A MOSTLY DRY
 START TO THE DAY AND LATER IN
 THE DAY WE START TO BRING THE
 STORM CHANCES IN, THE HIGH
 TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE MIDDLE
 80s.
 THE FORECAST FOR TOMORROW,
 KANSAS CITY ROYALS, 1:35 FOR
 THE FIRST PITCH, WE ARE GETTING
 LUCKY AT THE BEGINNING OF
 THINGS, BY THE END OF THE GAME,
 WE WILL BE TRACKING SOME WIDELY
 SCATTERED STORMS.
 BY THE FINISH, IT IS POSSIBLE
 THERE COULD BE A RAIN DELAY.
 CROSS YOUR FINGERS, 1:35 LOOKS
 LIKE A BETTER START TIME RATHER
 THAN MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON.
 TOMORROW, HERE ARE THE SHOWERS
 AND THE THUNDERSTORMS.
 GOING INTO MONDAY, THAT FRONT
 IS STILL CLOSE ENOUGH TO US, IT
 WILL LEAVE US WITH SOME STORM
 CHANCES.
 TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THAT HIGH-
 PRESSURE WILL COMPLETELY DRY
 ICE OUT, BRING US US TO A
 SLIGHTLY LOW HUMIDITY.
 IT WILL
 COMPLETELY DRY US OUT.
 STORM CHANCES CONTINUE TUESDAY
 AND WEDNESDAY.
 BACK IN THE TROPICS THERE IS A
 20% CHANCE OF A SYSTEM DEVELOP
 MEANT, ACTUALLY AN UPPER-LEVEL
 TROUGH OVER WESTERN TENNESSEE,
 IT WILL MOVE OUT TO THE GULF.
 THIS IS THE AREA THAT WE ARE
 GOING TO BE WATCHING FOR HEAVY
 RAINFALL TO SET UP SHOP TO THIS
 WEEK.
 IF YOU ARE TAKING A VACATION
 TOWARD PANAMA CITY - - PANAMA
 CITY BEACH, THIS IS WHAT I AM
 TRACKING WITH THE TROPICS THIS
 WEEK.
 THE LOW IN THE HIGH
 TEMPERATURES ARE AT 88.
 CLOUD COVER AND FOG WILL LIMIT
 HOW HOT WE GET, IS HUMID WITH
 THUNDERSTORMS LATE IN THE DAY
 AND INTO TOMORROW NIGHT.
 THERE WILL BE MORE STORMS ON
 MONDAY, IT WILL BE DRY ON
 TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY.
 WE WILL BE BRINGING BACK STORM
 CHANCES ON THURSDAY WITH MORE
 HUMIDITY THAT WILL RETURN ON
 FRIDAY.
