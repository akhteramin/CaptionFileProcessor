 Announcer: LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY, IT'S
 "THE WENDY WILLIAMS SHOW."

 NOW, HERE'S KEKE PALMER! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

 Keke: HEY!
 HI, EVERYONE!
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING
 HERE!
 I'M SO HAPPY THAT YOU GUYS ARE
 HERE, I'M SO HAPPY!
 SAY HELLO TO MY COHOSTS, MY
 STUDIO AUDIENCE!
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 HOW Y'ALL DOING?
 Audience: HOW YOU DOIN'?
 Keke: AND WE WANT TO SEND
 LOVE TO WENDY.
 I'M SO SAD THAT YOU'RE NOT HERE,
 BUT I'LL BE GETTING BETTER.
 I THINK YOU FOR LETTING ME TAKE
 OVER YOUR SHOW TODAY!
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 LET'S GET STARTED.
 IT'S TIME FOR SOME "HOT TOPICS"!
 A [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

 OKAY.
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 ALL RIGHT, SO, JUSTIN BIEBER AND
 HAILEY BALDWIN ON THE COVER OF
 "VOGUE" MAGAZINE.
 THEY REALLY DO LOOK BEAUTIFUL,
 THEY DO!
 I LOVE YOUNG MARRIAGE!
 I'M OFF HER YOUNG MARRIAGE.
 THEY GET THE BABIES OUT, I'M
 HERE FOR IT ALL.
 BUT IT WAS REALLY GREAT ARTICLE.
 IT TALKED ABOUT GETTING MARRIED,
 THE PROCESS.
 JUSTIN TALKS ABOUT WHY HE
 STEPPED AWAY FROM MUSIC, WHICH I
 REALLY CAN RELATE TO.
 WE BOTH GREW UP IN THE INDUSTRY.
 I REMEMBER WHEN HE WAS ON, AFTER
 HE GOT SIGNED.
 [APPLAUSE]
 HE TALKED ABOUT HOW IT SO HARD.
 GROWING UP IN THE ENTERTAINMENT
 INDUSTRY IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE
 YOUR ONLY FOCUS HAS BEEN YOUR
 CAREER, TO THE POINT THAT YOU
 DON'T THINK ABOUT ALL THE OTHER
 THINGS ABOUT LIFE.
 RELATING TO PEOPLE, WHO YOU WANT
 TO BECOME A WHAT YOU WANT TO DO
 IN YOUR DOWN TIME.
 YOU NEVER GET THE TIME TO REALLY
 DEVELOP IT.
 SO I WAS GLAD THAT HE SAID,
 "LOOK, I KNEW I NEEDED TO TAKE
 THIS TIME.
 THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO DO."
 AND I'M REALLY HAPPY FOR HIM.
 [APPLAUSE]
 HE ALSO TALKS ABOUT HOW SEX
 BECAME AN ADDICTION FOR HIM.
 I CAN ALSO RELATE TO THAT.
 [AUDIENCE REACTS]
 I'M JUST KIDDING!
 [LAUGHTER]
 HE ALSO TALKED ABOUT THAT.
 HE SAID, "LOOK, I REALIZE THIS
 IS A PROBLEM FOR ME.
 I WANT TO STOP IT."
 AND HE FEELS HIS REWARD WAS HIS
 BEAUTIFUL MARRIAGE.
 I'M GLAD HE IS SELF-AWARE.
 GOOD FOR THEM.
 I'M GLAD FOR THEM.
 [APPLAUSE]
 HALEY ALSO TALKED ABOUT HOW THE
 SOCIAL MEDIA TOOLS KEPT WANTING
 TO SEE THEM FAIL.
 Y'ALL, I JUST NEED TO KNOW --
 WHY DON'T THESE TROLLS EVER TAKE
 A DAY OFF?
 [LAUGHTER]
 THEY NEVER TAKE A DAY OFF!
 MY QUESTION IS, WHY DON'T WE
 MAKE IT TO WHERE PEOPLE GET ON
 SOCIAL MEDIA AND THEY HAVE TO
 CONNECT TO THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY
 NUMBER?
 [AUDIENCE REACTS]
 THAT WAY THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES!
 THE MORNING, TO POST, IT'S GOING
 TOWARD YOUR CREDIT SCORE!
 [LAUGHTER]
 [APPLAUSE]
 OKAY?
 EVEN THOUGH IT'S ALREADY AT 500,
 OKAY?
 [LAUGHTER]
 THIS IS WHAT I LOVE -THE WAY
 THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE PARTYING.
 WHEN HE WAS IN LIGHT OF THIS
 PAST WEEKEND, HE WENT TO THE
 CLUB AND SAID THAT NOBODY WAS
 DANCING AND EVERYONE STOOD
 AROUND LOOKING AT THEIR PHONES.
 AS A YOUNG PERSON THAT HE'S
 TALKING ABOUT, I CAN AGREE THAT
 THE EXEC WHO WOULD HAPPEN.
 I'M SICK OF IT!
 WHEN I WAS GROWING UP, BEING AT
 THIS ADULT AGE, I EXPECTED IT TO
 BE LIKE "SAVE THE LAST DANCE."
 [LAUGHTER]
 I EXPECTED BEING CLUB GOING BACK
 AND FORTH.
 [APPLAUSE]
 THAT'S NOT THE ENERGY.
 MY THING IS, IF THAT'S A DATED
 CONCEPT, WE NEED TO GO BACK TO
 THAT ERA.
 I WANT TO HAVE FUN IN THE CLUB
 AND DANCE WITH SOMEBODY!
 YOU KNOW?
 [APPLAUSE]
 DIDDY ANNOUNCE THAT HE'S GOING
 TO BRING DANCING BACK.
 HE SAID HE'S GOING TO HAVE THE
 DIDDY DANCING PARTIES.
 I'M READY FOR THEM.
 I'VE BEEN TO A DIDDY PARTY,
 YELL!
 YOU AIN'T BEEN TO A PARTY IF YOU
 AIN'T BEEN TO A P DOT DIDDY
 PARTY!
 I'M TELLING YOU
 NEXT WE HAVE ARIANA GRANDE. LOOK AT -YOU GUYS, SHE WAS
 ASKED THE OTHER DAY HOW SHE FELT
 ABOUT HER EX DATING KATE
 BECKINSALE.
 SHE REPLIED, "THEY ARE SO CUTE!"
 AND THOUGH THEY ARE THINKING SHE
 THROUGH SHADE.
 IT'S A LOSE-LOSE SITUATION.
 FIRST OF ALL, THEY WERE BEING
 SHADY ASKING HER THAT.
 WHAT HAS SHE GOT TO SAY ABOUT
 THIS MAN LIVING ON THE LIVING
 HIS LIFE QUESTION WHICH IS
 LIVING HER LIFE, AS WELL.
 IF SHE WOULDN'T HAVE SAID
 ANYTHING, THEY WOULD HAVE SAID
 SHE WAS BEING BETTER.
 MAYBE SHE REALLY THINKS THEY'RE
 CUTE AND LET'S MOVE ON.
 LEAVE THESE PEOPLE ALONE.
 OKAY.
 NOW, MICHAEL B. JORDAN -HE
 SAYS HE WENT TO THERAPY AFTER
 PLAYING THE RUTHLESS VILLAIN AND
 BLACK PANTHER.
 HE SAYS THAT HE SPENT SO MUCH
 I'M ISOLATING HIMSELF FOR THAT
 ROLE THAT IT WAS HARD TO GET OUT
 OF THE VILLAIN MIND-SET WHEN THE
 CAMERAS WERE OFF.
 I CAN RELATE TO THIS, BECAUSE I
 PLAY THE CHARACTER THIS LAST
 YEAR -I GUESS IT WAS A COUPLE
 OF YEARS AGO.
 [APPLAUSE]
 I PLAYED THE CHARACTER, HER NAME
 IS WEDNESDAY.
 IT WAS A MOVIE TITLED "PIMP,"
 AND IT WAS A VERY INTENSE ROLE.
 I NEEDED TO TAKE A BREAK OR DO
 SOME WORK HOW MANY TYPE OF
 STUFF, BECAUSE THAT WASN'T ME,
 LOVE!
 [LAUGHTER]
 I REMEMBER HEARING AS A KID,
 DENZIL L OR SEAN PENN, ANY OF
 THESE PEOPLE WOULD SAY
 , "I NEED TO TAKE A BREAK AFTER PULLING THIS DEEP, DRAMATIC
 GROWTH."
 AND I WOULD NEVER UNDERSTAND IT.
 BUT WHEN YOU GO INTO THESE TYPES
 OF CHARACTERS THAT ARE SO
 DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT FROM YOU,
 IT'S VERY MUCH NEEDED.
 SO I'M GLAD THAT
 MICHAEL B. JORDAN SEEKING CARE
 OF HIMSELF.
 [APPLAUSE]
 YOUR EMOTIONS DO NOT KNOW THAT YOU ARE KIDDING.
 OKAY?
 OKAY.
 SO, KATY PERRY'S STYLIST IS IN
 HOT WATER.
 ACCORDING TO "THE BLAST," BACK
 IN 2017      2017 SHE ALLEGEDLYD
 18 PIECES OF JEWELRY FOR THE
 GRAMMY AWARDS BUT ALLEGEDLY ONLY
 RETURNED 14 PIECES.
 THE JEWELER IS NOW SUING HER
 STYLIST FOR $120,000.
 [AUDIENCE REACTS]
 CHILD, YOU BETTER BE CAREFUL
 WITH THESE STYLISTS.
 [APPLAUSE]
 OKAY?
 I'VE BEEN DEALING WITH THESE
 STYLISTS FOR YEARS.
 SOMETIMES YOU GIVE IT BACK TO
 THEM AND THEY KEEP IT.
 SO YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
 TO THAT JEWELRY!
 AS A KID, WHEN THEY WOULD GIVE
 ME $15,000, $100,000 JEWELRY, I
 SAID, "KEEP IT, BELOVED.
 I'M GOOD."
 BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BE
 RESPONSIBLE FOR SOMETHING I'M
 NOT GOING TO PAY FOR.
 IF I'M NOT GOING TO BUY IT, IF
 IT'S GETTING LOST, I DON'T WANT
 HAVE TO DO WITH THE
 RESPONSIBILITY.
 I HOPE THAT ALL GETS WORKED OUT,
 BECAUSE THAT'S A HIGHER BILL.
 [APPLAUSE]
 GIVE ME SOMETHING FROM THE
 BEAUTY SUPPLY.
 OKAY?
 SO, PAM ANDERSON'S SON, BRANDON
 LEE, DROPPED OUT OF COLLEGE
 AFTER ONLY TWO WEEKS AND HIS MOM
 WAS PISSED.
 HE SAID WHEN HE SHOWED UP WITH
 HIS BAG, SHE TOLD HIM TO "GET
 THE [BLEEP] OUT OF HERE."
 SOME PEOPLE WILL SAY THAT I'M IN
 THE EXTREME MILLENNIAL FOR
 SAYING THIS, BUT COLLEGES AND
 FOR EVERYBODY.
 I STRONGLY AGREE WITH THAT.
 [APPLAUSE]
 I REALLY BELIEVE THAT.
 HERE'S THE THING.
 THE FIRST OF ALL, THE COLLEGE
 DEBT ISSUE.
 IT'S REALLY AN ISSUE!
 IT REALLY IS!
 PEOPLE GO TO SCHOOL TO GET
 DEGREES, AND THEY COME OUT OF
 SCHOOL AND THEY CAN'T DO
 ANYTHING WITH THEM TO EVEN PAY.
 HOW CRAZY IS THAT?
 [APPLAUSE]
 HOW CRAZY IS THAT?
 YOU GO TO SCHOOL TO GET A
 DEGREE, TO GET A JOB, TO PAY FOR
 YOUR DEBT, BUT YOU CAN'T GET ONE
 SO YOU ARE JUST INTO THAT.
 THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE.
 THE NUMBER TWO ISSUE IS THAT NOT
 EVERY PASSION YOU HAVE CAN BE
 VALIDATED BY A DEGREE OR A
 CERTIFICATE.
 [APPLAUSE]
 YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
 IF YOU WANT TO BE A
 CHOREOGRAPHER, SPEND YOUR HOME
 HUSTLING IN THE DESERT
 COMMUNITY.
 IF YOU WANT TO BE A PAINTER,
 FIGURE OUT HOW TO PUT TIME INTO
 THAT.
 I FEEL LIKE SCHOOL APPLIES MOST
 PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BE A DOCTOR
 OR PSYCHOLOGIST, THINGS OF THAT
 SORT.
 I'M SAD HIS MAMA CUSSED HIM OUT,
 BUT...
 [LAUGHTER]
 MAY BE NEEDED TIME TO FIGURE OUT
 WHAT HIS PASSION WAS.
 [APPLAUSE]
 BUT, GET INTO THIS.
 HE ENDED UP WORKING AT A
 SMOOTHIE PLACE, LIVING ON HIS
 FRIEND'S COUCH, WHEN HE STARTED
 DOING MODELING JOBS.
 SO, LOOK AT THAT!
 [APPLAUSE]
 GO AHEAD, BRANDON!
 WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU
 GUYS.
 UP NEXT WE ARE BREAKING DOWN
 WHAT TO EXPECT AT THIS YEAR'S
 GRAMMY AWARDS.
 SO, GRAB A SNACK AND COME ON
 BACK!
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]


 [APPLAUSE]
 Keke: THE GRAMMY'S ARE THE
 BIGGEST NIGHT OF MUSIC.
 HERE TO BREAK IT ALL DOWN, IT'S
 POP-CULTURE EXPERT CHRIS
 WEATHERSPOON!
 HAD LOW!
 Chris: IT'S AMAZING!
 YOUR OUTFIT IS OVER!
 EVERY TIME, IT'S A KEKE, YELL!
 Keke: ALICIA KEYS IS THE
 FIRST WOMAN TO HOST AND FORTUNE
 YEARS?
 SPEAK IS THE FIRST
 TIME WE ARE HAVING A WOMAN HOST AND FORTUNE NEWS.
 THE LAST TIME WAS QUEEN LATIFAH
 IN 2005.
 SHE'S THE PERFECT PERSON BECAUSE
 SHE AND BY SO FEMALE EMPOWERMEN
 EMPOWERMENT.
 ALICIA KEYS IS REALLY TRYING TO
 SHOW FOLKS A DIFFERENT SIDE.
 SHE HAS THIS YOUTUBE CHANNEL
 WHERE SHE'S TAKING YOU TAKING
 YOU BEHIND THE SCENES FROM WHEN
 SHE FIRST FOUND OUT SHE WAS
 HOSTING.
 TELL HER HUSBAND WHILE HE'S
 LAYING IN BED, TELLING HER KIDS
 ALSO.
 SHE REALLY WANTS US TO SEE THAT
 SHE CAN BE A LITTLE BIT MORE
 AMPED UP.
 Keke: MISS ALICIA!
 NOT THAT SHE'S GONE, BUT I'M
 GLAD SHE'S BEING MORE INTO THE
 FAMILY VIBE.
 SO I'M VERY GLAD I'M GOING TO
 GET TO SEE HER OUT.
 Chris: AND I'M GLAD THEY
 ARE CHOOSING HER.
 ONE, SHE'S AN R&B LIVES THAT
 DON'T NEGLIGENT.
 SHE HAS WON 15 GRAMMY AWARDS.
 SHE KNOWS WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE
 ON THAT SPEECH.
 YOU HAVE SO MANY NEWCOMERS.
 Keke: I HAVE TO ASK YOUR
 OPINION ABOUT THE SPIRIT HOW DO
 YOU FEEL ABOUT J.LO DOING --
 Chris: THIS ONE IS VERY
 CONTROVERSIAL.
 PROBABLY THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL
 TOPIC HEADING INTO THE
 GRAMMY AWARDS.
 JENNIFER LOPEZ PERFORMING A
 MOTOWN TRIBUTE.
 THERE WILL BE A LOT OF TRIBUTES
 THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.
 BUT THE BIG ONE ON SUNDAY NIGHT,
 IT'S BEEN ANNOUNCED THAT J.LO
 WILL BE PERFORMING IT.
 NO WORD IF YOU WILL BE JOINED
 WITH ANYONE.
 BUT IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE YOU
 HAVE THESE ICONS LIKE GLADYS
 KNIGHT AND LIONEL RICHIE AND
 SMOKEY ROBINSON, THEY WERE
 SIGNED TO MOTOWN.
 THEY COULD DO THE TRIBUTE.
 Chris: NO SHADE TOWARD
 J.LO, BECAUSE I'M A HUGE FAN.
 I LOVE HER.
 BUT I DON'T THINK SHE WOULD HAVE
 BEEN MY FIRST CHOICE AND
 THINKING OF MOTOWN.
 WHAT ABOUT JAZMINE SULLIVAN?
 Chris: "FANTASIA," THE LIST
 GOES ON.
 I GET THEY WANT SOME ANYMORE
 CURRENT AND YOUNGER, BUT YOU
 HAVE BOYS TO MEN WHO WERE ALSO
 SIGNED TO MOTOWN.
 I'M A LITTLE BIT SURPRISED.
 I'M HOPING SHE CALLS EVERYONE
 SHE KNOWS.
 "GIRL, WILL YOU HAVE      COME E
 WITH ME?"
 BECAUSE YOU NEED SOMEBODY BLACK
 WITH HER.
 IF SHE NEEDS ME, I'LL BE OUT
 THERE!
 I WILL DO A DOO-WOP IN THE
 BACKGROUND, I AIN'T SCARED!
 I WILL DO IT!
 Keke: ARIANA GRANDE, SHE
 CANCELED HER PERFORMANCE.
 I'M VERY SURPRISED BY THAT.
 Chris: I HOPE WE HAVE A TEA
 KETTLE, BECAUSE I'M GOING TO
 GIVE YOU BUNCH OF TEA RIGHT NOW.
 HERE WE GO.
 ARIANA GRANDE ON THE GROUND TO
 COVER ALBUM CAME OUT TODAY.
 SHE HAS THE NUMBER ONCE IN THE
 COUNTRY RIGHT NOW WITH "SEVEN
 RINGS."
 IT'S MY JAM.
 SO SHE WAS SCHEDULED TO PERFORM
 AT THE GRAMMYS, BUT DECIDED TO
 PULL OUT DUE TO ARTISTIC
 DIFFERENCES.
 SHE WANTED HER FROM THE WHOLE
 ENTIRE SONG, "SEVEN RINGS."
 BUT THEY SAID NO AND THEY
 ALLOWED HER TO DO SEVEN RINGS
 BUT ONLY IF SHE DID A MEDLEY OF
 THEIR CHOOSING AFTERWARDS.
 AND SHE SAID "THANK U, NEXT."
 LORDE WAS NOMINATED FOR ALBUM OF
 THE YEAR, BUT INSTEAD OF DOING A
 SON OF A PROBLEM THEY WANTED HER
 TO PERFORM A TRIBUTE TO TOM
 PETTY.
 SHE SAID, "I'M GOING TO BE PETTY
 AND NOT DO ANYTHING."
 AND SHE DIDN'T PERFORM.
 BUT I'M CURIOUS.
 NUMBER ONE, BECAUSE YOU KNOW
 ARIANNA.
 IS IT EASY TO WORK WITH CUSTOMER
 QUIT SHE SHE LIKE TO WORK WITH?
 Keke: I LOVE HER, WE DID
 "SCREAM QUEENS" TOGETHER.
 ME AND HER GO WAY BACK.
 AS AN ARTIST, IT ALL GOES BACK
 TO WHAT YOU PUT IN YOUR BRAIN.
 EVERY PRECIOUS WITH THAT.
 ONCE IT'S THERE, IT'S THERE.
 THEY WERE ASKING HER TO DO
 SOMETHING SHE STRONGLY DIDN'T
 AGREE WITH.
 I FEEL LIKE, "GIRL, YOU BETTER
 GO AHEAD."
 IT'S GOOD BECAUSE YOU ACTUALLY
 SAID, "THIS IS THE GRAMMYS BUT
 THEY DON'T WANT ME TO SHOWN IN
 THE WAY I WANT TO BE SHOWN."
 AND TO SAY NO TAKES A LOT OF
 STRENGTH.
 MOST PEOPLE WILL SAY, "IT'S THE
 GRAMMYS, THEY DO WHAT I GOT TO
 DO."
 IMAGINE GETTING A HUGE PLATFORM
 LIKE THAT IN DOING SOMETHING
 THAT YOU WEREN'T HAPPY WITH.
 THAT'S WORSE.
 [APPLAUSE]
 Chris: I AGREE.
 AS LONG AS SHE WAS DOING HER OWN
 SONGS -AGAIN, HER ALBUM IS OUT
 TODAY AND PROBABLY WILL BE
 NUMBER ONE THIS WEEKEND.
 I WOULD HAVE GONE OUT THERE AND
 DID "THANK U, NEXT."
 Keke: THAT'S THE GAG!
 [APPLAUSE]
 WHO ARE YOU EXCITED TO SEE
 PERFORM?
 Chris: CARDI B, CARDI B,
 CARDI B, YELL.
 [APPLAUSE]
 I LIKE TO SAY, "IN CARDI WE
 TRUST."
 THINK BACK TO LAST YEAR, SHE HAD
 A LITTLE MOMENT WITH BRUNO MARS.
 BUT NOW SHE IS NOMINATED FOR
 FIVE GRAMMY AWARDS AND SHE MIGHT
 MAKE HISTORY, THE ALL.
 SHE COULD BE THE FIRST WOMAN TO
 WIN THE BEST RAP ALBUM EVER IN
 THE HISTORY OF THE GRAMMYS.
 IF SHE WINS OUT A WORD, I MIGHT
 CRY.
 Keke: I SHOCKED.
 I THOUGHT MAYBE LIL KIM HAD ONE.
 I GUESS NOT.
 Chris: SHE WOULD BE THE
 FIRST WANT TO WIN IT.
 SHE HAS WORKED SO HARD THIS
 YEAR, SHE DID THE PEPSI THING
 FOR HALFTIME.
 ALONG WITH YOUR GIRL, DOLLY
 PARTON, YOUR FORMER COSTAR WHO
 I'M IN LOVE WITH.
 PLEASE TEXT OR AFTER THIS AND
 SAY I'M YOUR BIGGEST FAN.
 SHE HAS BEEN NAMED THE MUSIC
 CARES PERSON OF THE YEAR.
 SHE WILL BE JOINED ON STAGE BY
 KATY PERRY, CASEY MUSGRAVE.
 ALSO LITTLE BIG TOWN.
 Keke: MILEY ISN'T
 PERFORMING WITH HER?
 Chris: NO, SHE HAS A SOLO
 PERFORMANCE.
 Keke: THAT'S HER GODMOTHER!
 Chris: YOU BETTER COME UP
 WITH THE FAMILY TO!
 AND I'M EXCITED FOR DIANA ROSS
 [APPLAUSE]
 SHE'S GOING TO BE PERFORMING.
 SHE TURNED 75 ON MARCH 26.
 Keke: 75?
 WAIT A MINUTE.
 75 AND LOOKING LIKE THAT?
 [APPLAUSE]
 Chris: WE NEED A POINTER TO
 GO OVER THE WORK THAT SHE HAS
 NOT HAD DONE!
 BECAUSE I DON'T SEE ANY WORK
 DONE!
 THAT'S A NATURAL, FIERCE 75.
 BUT SHE IS CELEBRATING HER
 BIRTHDAY ON THE GRAMMY AWARDS,
 DURING A MEDLEY OF ALL HER SONGS
 FROM MOTOWN.
 WHICH WILL BE AMAZING.
 [APPLAUSE]
 Keke: THEY HAVE TO BE
 JOINING HER TOGETHER SOME WAY
 WITH THE MOTOWN.
 Chris: I'M PROUD OF THE
 GRAMMYS.
 OFTEN TIMES THEY OVERLOOK THE
 LEGENDS AND FOCUSED TOO MUCH ON
 THE YOUNGER SINGERS.
 BUT I THINK ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE
 HER AND TINA TURNER, AND THE
 ONES THAT REALLY PAVED THE WAY
 FOR THESE YOUNGER ARTISTS.
 I'M PROUD OF Y'ALL FOR GIVING
 THEM A "NO" MOSH
 Keke: I'M HAPPY WE WILL GET
 MORE HIP-HOP RECOGNITION AT THE
 WORDS.
 IT REMINDS ME OF HOW
 ROCK 'N' ROLL WAS BACK IN THE
 DAY.
 WHAT I'M SAYING?
 ROCK 'N' ROLL WAS UNDERGROUND.
 PEOPLE DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO BE
 BOTHERED WITH IT.
 THEN IT BECAME THE BIGGEST THING
 EVER.
 THAT REALLY IS WHAT HAPPENED
 WITH HIP-HOP.
 IT WAS UNDERGROUND.
 [APPLAUSE]
 AND NOW IT'S THE BIGGEST GENRE
 OF MUSIC OUT RIGHT NOW.
 IT INFLUENCES EVERY KIND MUSIC.
 THEY SHOULD BE GETTING THEIR
 SHOT AT THE GRAMMYS.
 Chris: YOUR PREACHING!
 KENDRICK LAMAR IS NOMINATED FOR
 EIGHT AWARDS.
 HE'S LEADING THE PACK ACROSS ALL
 GENRES.
 "BLACK PANTHER," THE MOVIE, THE
 SOUNDTRACK.
 IT'S A GIFT THAT KEEPS ON
 GIVING.
 ALSO, TRICK IS NOMINATED FOR
 ALBUM OF THE YEAR, A RECORD OF
 THE YEAR.
 I HAVE ONE QUESTION.
 KIKI, DO YOU LOVE ME?
 ALSO, CHILDISH GAMBINO NOMINATED
 FOR FIVE AWARDS.
 YOU FEEL THIS SHIFT IS DUE TO
 ARTISTS LIKE JAY-Z AND KANYE WHO
 SPOKE OUT AGAINST THE GRAMMYS IN
 THE PAST?
 Keke: ISAAC IT'S HARD FOR
 THEM TO DID DIE WITH THE
 CULTURE'S DOING.
 YOU CAN'T DENY WHAT IS SO
 OBVIOUS.
 WHAT WAS THAT LEONARDO
 DiCAPRIO WOULD BECOME "THE
 GREAT GATSBY?"
 WHERE JAY-Z WAS IN THE
 SOUNDTRACK?
 YOU HAVE THINGS LIKE THAT
 HAPPENING ANY RELAYS INFLUENCES
 GLOBAL.
 SO YOU HAVE TO APPRECIATE THE
 PEOPLE WHO CREATED IT.
 Chris: CAN WE DO HIP-HOP
 ALBUM COST MIKE I WILL POP OFF.
 I'LL DO IT.
 Keke: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE
 SNUBS.
 Chris: THE QUEEN BEE AND
 JAY-Z, THEY'VE BEEN STUMPED IN A
 BIG WAY.
 THEY PUT OUT THEIR ALBUM,
 "EVERYTHING IS LOVE," BUT
 APPARENTLY EVERYTHING IS NOT
 LOVE AS GRAMMYS.
 THEY WERE NOT NOMINATED FOR THE
 BIG THREE CATEGORIES.
 Keke: CAN I SAY SOMETHING
 CRAZY?
 PEOPLE WILL BE LIKE, "WHOA."
 FIRST     FIRST WELCOME AWARDS T
 EVERYTHING.
 YOU ALWAYS NEED AN ACCOLADE.
 YOU DO WHAT YOU DO BECAUSE YOU
 LOVE IT.
 BUT IF YOU FEEL THAT YOU GO TO
 AN AWARD SHOW EACH AND EVERY
 YEAR TO BE SNUBBED OR WHATEVER
 YOU MAY FEEL, DON'T GO.
 DON'T GO!
 [APPLAUSE]
 YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
 IF YOU FEEL THAT WAY, YOU FEEL
 LIKE YOU ARE NOT BEING
 RESPECTED -WE HAVE SEEN IT
 TIME AND TIME AGAIN.
 WITH THE OSCARS, WITH THE
 GRAMMYS.
 SPECIFICALLY, PEOPLE OF COLOR
 ARE ALWAYS FEELING AS THOUGH,
 "HEY, I'M NOT GETTING THE
 RESPECT OF RECOGNITION I DESERVE
 WHEN I HAVE THE FANS IN THE
 AUDIENCE.
 IT'S ALL HERE, IT'S ALL RIGHT
 THERE."
 THEN DON'T GO.
 GO TO WHERE YOU ARE SUPPORTED.
 [APPLAUSE]
 GO TO THE NAACP AWARDS.
 GO TO THE BET AWARDS.
 Chris: YOU ARE SO RIGHT.
 I THINK JAY-Z PROBABLY HAD AN
 AHA MOMENT.
 HE WAS NOMINATED FOR EIGHT
 AWARDS AND DIDN'T GET ONE OF
 THEM.
 AND BEYONCE, A COUPLE YEARS
 BACK, "LIMITED" CHANGE MY LIFE
 AND IT DIDN'T GET ALBUM OF THE
 YEAR.
 ADELE SAID "THIS IS THE REWARD."
 BUT SHE WAS OVERLOOKED IN THE
 BIG WAY.
 GIVE THE PERSON WHO GOT THE
 SNUBBED IS NICKI MINAJ.
 WE LOVE HER ALBUM, HE WENT
 PLATINUM, BUT SHE HAS BEEN KNOWN
 THIS YEAR FOR HER BELIEFS
 INSTEAD OF HER BEATS.
 I THINK SHE'S AN ICON.
 SHE TRAIL BLAZED.
 I THINK SHE WILL BE BACK IN
 FUTURE YEARS.
 Keke: I LOVE NICKI.
 [APPLAUSE]
 THAT KILLS ME.
 THERE IS SO MUCH MORE THAT ME
 AND YOU COULD GO BACK AND FORTH
 ABOUT.
 Chris: WE COULD KIKI ON AND
 ON, Y'ALL!
 Keke: I THINK YOU SO MUCH
 FOR BEING HERE.
 [APPLAUSE]
 YOU CAN WATCH THE GRAMMY AWARDS
 THE SUNDAY NIGHT AT 8:00 ON CBS.
 UP NEXT, THE HOTTEST CELEBRITY
 MAKEUP TRENDS.
 STAY TUNED!
 A [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

       I'm a close talker.
  So I was excited about All-New  Colgate Total.
  Its breakthrough formula does  more...
            Wonderful.
     Sensitivity, strengthens     teeth...
 It kills germs through my whole mouth..
     I like your confidence.
         Thanks Mr. Lee!
 Now there's no such thing as too close.
          Yes, there is.
         No, there's not.
          Yes there is.
         No, there's not!
              Okay.
      <i> All-New Colgate Total.</i>
  <i> Do more for your whole mouth.</i>
    <i> There's the same old way</i>
     <i> to smooth, and there's</i>     <i> new Fructis Sleek Shot,</i>
   <i> our first in-shower styler.</i>
               <i> Just mix the shot</i>               <i> with shampoo,</i>
      <i> power up with lather.</i>
                  <i> Five times</i>                  <i> smoother hair,</i>
                  <i> half the time.</i>
       <i> Skip the flat iron.</i>
                     <i> New Fructis</i>                     <i> Sleek Shot.</i>
    <i> By Garnier,</i>    <i> naturally!</i>
                     <i> New Fructis</i>                     <i> Sleek Shot.</i>
 [APPLAUSE]
 Keke: HERE TO SHOW US THE
 HOTTEST LIBERTY MAKEUP TRENDS
 THE SEASON, OUR FRIEND, NATALIE.
 I CHANGE FOR YOU!
 Natalie: YES!
 YOU ARE SERVING A LITTLE COLOR
 BLOCK ACTION!
 Keke: CALVIN KLEIN, YOU
 KNOW!
 Natalie: SHE KNOWS IT!
 A BEAUTIFUL WARDROBE, WITH THE
 TICKET TO THE MAKEUP.
 Keke: OF COURSE WE DO.
 WITH THESE KINDS OF CELEBRITY
 TRENDS, THEY ARE EASY TO DO.
 LET'S TALK ABOUT CARDI B.
 SHALL BE CUSTOMER WHO DOESN'T
 LOVE A LITTLE CARDI B COST TO
 MARKET SHE LOVES A LITTLE POP OF
 COLOR.
 Keke: SHE LIKES TAKING
 CHANCES FOR MAKEUP, YEAH.
 Natalie: MAY BE SOME OF US
 WANT TO DO A LITTLE POP OF
 COLOR, A SMOKY EYE.
 IT'S A LOT.
 IT'S A BIG COMMITMENT.
 NOT EVERYBODY CAN COME IN A
 FULL-COLOR BLOG OUTFIT.
 RIGHT?
 BUT IF YOU WANT TO DO A LITTLE
 POP, LET'S START WITH A LITTLE
 EYELINER.
 JUST LIKE CARDI DID.
 HE WILL TAKE A GREAT GREEN, LIKE
 KILLMONGER DID, AND YOU WILL
 JUST TAKE IT AND DO IT ON THE
 BOTTOM.
 THAT WAY IT DOESN'T TURN INTO
 THIS
 ENORMOUS SMOKY EYE. HAVE YOU DONE ONE?
 Keke: I LIKED IT.
 IT DEPENDS WHAT IS, IF YOU DON'T
 TOO MUCH.
 TO THINK THAT UNDERLINED BLACK
 IS NECESSARY?
 OR IS IT ON ITS OWN?
 Natalie: IS ALL ABOUT WHAT
 YOU ARE FEELING.
 IT'S A GREAT LITTLE VIBE.
 IF YOU CAN CARRY IT, GO FOR IT!
 A LITTLE POP OF COLOR.
 [APPLAUSE]
 TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF MAY BE A
 GREEN EYE SHADOW.
 GIVE IT A LITTLE EXTRA, AND YOU
 ARE SERVING IT UP.
 IT LOOKS SO PRETTY ON YOU!
 THANK YOU.
 Natalie: ANOTHER QUICK TIP
 I WANTED TO TELL YOU.
 IF YOU WANT TO DO A LITTLE BIT
 OF THE PINK ON THE I LIKE CARDI
 DID, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BREAK THE
 BANK.
 JUST USE SOME BLUSH.
 I'M SAVING YOUR PENNIES, TOO!
 ALL RIGHT?
 THAT'S HOW WE DO.
 LET'S TALK ABOUT THE VAMP BEAT
 WHIP.
 LADY GAGA.
 OH, YES.
 SHE CAN DO NO WRONG RIGHT NOW!
 THAT LIP IS SO POPULAR.
 Keke: OUT AND ABOUT YOU
 GUYS BUT SOMETIMES I'M SCARED TO
 GO TO DARKER MY LIPS.
 Natalie: MISS WENDY DOESN'T
 LOVE A DARK LIP, BUT SHE'S NOT
 HERE RIGHT NOW!
 I LOVE YOU, WENDY!
 IF YOU WANT TO MAKE IT A LITTLE
 MORE MODERN -WE HAVE DONE THIS
 GREAT, DEEP LIP ON CHANEL.
 HERE'S A TRICK.
 WANT TO MAKE IT AN OMBRE EFFECT.
 YOU DON'T DO THE LIP LINER LIKE
 WE DID IN THE 90s, Y'ALL.
 WE ARE RELIANT THE WHOLE LIP
 WITH BLACK.
 I DID ALL THE TIME IN SCHOOL.
 Keke: AND JUST A BUNCH OF
 LIP GLOSS.
 WE ALL REMEMBER.
 Natalie: I'M SURE HE LOOKED
 GREAT ON YOU, BUT NOT EVERYBODY
 ELSE IN THE WORLD.
 WHAT WE WILL DO IS TAKE IT AND
 JUST DO IT ON THE OUTER CORNERS
 OF THE MOUTH.
 WHAT THAT'S GOING TO DO IS NOT
 ONLY GIVE YOU THAT GREAT OMBRE
 EFFECT, Y'ALL, BUT IT'S ALSO
 GOING TO -HOW DO YOU SAY IT,
 MAKE YOUR LIPS LOOK FULLER?
 SHE DOESN'T NEED HER LIPS TO
 LOOK FULLER, BUT FOR THE REST OF
 THE WORLD OUT THERE WHO DO WANT
 THAT POUTY LIP -TAKE THAT
 BRUSH AND BLEND IT SO IT'S A
 BEAUTIFUL OMBRE EFFECT.
 AND HERE'S ANOTHER LITTLE CREEK
 SECRET.
 TWO MORE THINGS FOR THE VAMP YOU
 LIP PEOPLE.
 YOU WANT TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF
 A SHIMMER.
 AND YOU PUT IT RIGHT IN THE
 CENTER.
 THERE!
 Keke: THAT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL!
 Natalie: YES, MISS THING!
 Keke: THAT GAVE HER MORE OF
 A GLOW.
 Natalie: GIVES MORE OF A
 GLOW, YOUR LIPS LOOK BIGGER.
 HERE'S ONE MORE TRICK.
 IF YOU WANT TO DO THE VAMP LIP,
 MY SUGGESTION WITHOUT TO HAVE A
 SHINY FACE.
 THEN YOU LOOK CRAY-CRAY.
 HE STEPPED OUT OF THE CLUB A
 LITTLE TOO LATE.
 YOU KNOW THE LOOK.
 ANYWAY, WE WANT TO TAKE A GREAT
 MODIFIER.
 SOMETHING THAT WILL BE
 INVISIBLE.
 YOU DON'T WANT TO BE TOO DRY AND
 ASHY.
 IS THAT GORGEOUS?
 THAT WAY YOU WILL HAVE THAT
 BEAUTIFUL FRESH DELICIOUS LOOK.
 Keke: LOOK HOW BEAUTIFUL
 SHE IS!
 THEM BROWS, THOSE EYES!
 [APPLAUSE]
 Natalie: THAT IS YOUR
 LADY GAGA LIP.
 FAST AND EASY.
 Keke: LET'S GET INTO THIS
 LAST TREND.
 THERE IS A LITTLE LADY NAMED
 MISS ANGELA BASSETT.
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 DO YOU KNOW HER?
 Wendy: I DO, I DO!
 Natalie: I THINK YOU MOM!
 EVERYBODY SAYS, "ANGELA
 BASSETT'S RETURN!"
 SO I TAKE IT AS A COMPLIMENT.
 [APPLAUSE]
 Natalie: THAT FACE, LOVE
 IT!
 YOU REALLY DO RESEMBLE HER.
 THE CHEEKBONES.
 THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT.

  Do you push through migraine?
     Mom, are you OK to play?
 Yeah honey, how about we play...
      princess and pirates?
   Imagine what you can do with   more migraine-free days.
             Arr!
            En garde!
     When you're not fighting     through migraine
    imagine the possibilities.
  Once-monthly Emgality is used  for the prevention
      of migraine in adults.
  It's specifically developed to  help give you
     more migraine-free days.
  With Emgality about 60% of  people had their migraine days
       cut in half or more.
 Do not use if you are allergic to Emgality or its ingredients.
   Emgality may cause allergic   reactions, such as
     itching, rash, hives and     trouble breathing,
 which can happen days after use.
 Call your doctor or get medical help right away
    if you have symptoms of an    allergic reaction.

 HOW COME YOU'RE ALWAYS LYING TO
 ME?
 MA, DO YOU EVEN CARE TO ASK WHAT
 HAPPENED TO ME?
 IF YOU GOT ME OUT OF HERE, WE
 CAN GO TALK ABOUT IT.
 I'M IN TROUBLE!
 BIG TROUBLE!
 I SHOULDN'T EVEN BE HERE RIGHT
 NOW!
 YOU SITTING LOOKING AT MY BUSTED
 FACE?
 I JUST WANT TO GO HOME RIGHT
 UP.
 I'M SURE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
 THAT.
 YOU SAID YOU WEREN'T DOING
 MORE DRUGS.
 WHERE YOU GOING WITH THIS?
 DO YOU HAVE MORE MONEY OR NOT?
 Keke: THAT WAS A CLIP FOR
 MY NEW MOVIE.
 IT'S STREAMING, YOU CAN CHECK IT
 OUT NOW.
 BUT THEY HAVE THE CHECK OUT MY
 OUTFIT!
 [APPLAUSE]
 KEEP GOING!
 I'M KIDDING.
 NOW IT'S TIME FOR "ASK KEKE."
 WHAT'S YOUR QUESTION?
 HEY, KEKE.
 HOW YOU DOIN'?
 MY NAME IS MALAIKA.
 I'M A FRIEND, WE'VE BEEN FRIEND
 FOR TEN YEARS.
 EVERY TIME WE GO OUT, SHE GETS
 DRUNK AND HAS AN ALTERCATION.
 SHE THROWS DRINKS AT BJ's.
 Keke: HOW LONG HAVE YOU
 BEEN FRIENDS?
 TEN YEARS.
 Keke: AND THIS IS SOMETHING
 SHE CONTINUOUSLY DOES?
 MY QUESTION IS, MY MOM ALWAYS
 TELLS ME, THE TIME AND PLACE TO
 SERVE.
 YOU CAN NEVER SAY, I WANT TO
 INVITE HER TO BE CERTAIN EVENTS
 BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE
 MIGHT ACT.
 OR, YOU CAN PRETTY MUCH SAY TO
 HER, "LOOK, THIS IS HOW I FEEL
 THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING, GIRL.
 AS A FRIEND, I DON'T WANT YOU
 LOOKING CRAZY OR GETTING INTO
 TROUBLE.
 I'M NOT JUDGING YOU, BUT GIRL,
 WE DON'T GOTTA GET ANGRY WITH
 NOBODY!"
 [APPLAUSE]
 WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T TEXT IT.
 SAY IT IN PERSON, GIRL.
 I'VE RUINED A FEW RELATIONSHIPS
 TEXTING THESE COMBOS.
 MAKE SURE YOU TELL HER.
 [APPLAUSE]
 HI, HOW ARE YOU?
 HI, KEKE.
 I'M TIFFANY.
 HOW YOU DOIN' COSTA McKAY WAS
 A CHRISTMAS PARTY, I WAS
 RELIEVED BY BEING WITH THIS CUTE
 GUY.
 HE WAS 6'3".
 LATER ON I FOUND OUT THAT MY
 BEST FRIEND HOOKED UP WITH HIM
 BEFORE.
 SHE SAID IT WAS COOL, BUT I
 FIGURE IT'S KIND OF WEIRD.
 SHOULD I CONTINUE PURSUING HIM
 OR SHOULD I JUST QUIT IT?
 Keke: HAVE YOU BEEN TALKING
 SINCE YOU MET AT THAT PARTY?
 YEAH.
 SO THERE'S A CONTINUE TO
 PROVIDE THAT IT COULD GO
 SOMEWHERE.
 WHEN YOU ASK YOUR FRIEND, DID
 YOU HEAR AT HOME AND SHE SAID IT
 WAS IT OVERTAXED?
 SHE'S FINE WITH ME BUT SHE
 DOESN'T LIKE HIM.
 HE'S A FRIEND WHEN SHE THINKS
 THAT HE'S JUST GOING TO USE ME.
 BUT I DON'T KNOW.
 Keke: IT DOESN'T MEAN HE'LL
 DO IT WITH YOU.
 ANYWAY, IF YOU ASK YOUR FRIEND
 AND SHE HAS TOLD YOU THAT SHE
 DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING -THAT
 SHE'S NOT COMFORTABLE WITH IT
 AND HE RESPECTED HER ENOUGH TO
 ASK IT, HOPEFULLY SHE SAID WHAT
 SHE MEANT AND SHE MEANT WHAT SHE
 SAID.
 YOU CAN'T HOLD ON FOR HER.
 SHE ALREADY SAID IT SO ENJOY NEW
 POSSIBLE GUIDE.
 [APPLAUSE]
 Keke: WE DOING IT LIKE
 THIS?
 YES!
 MY NAME IS ARLENE.
 MY QUESTION, BEFORE YOU CAN TELL
 YOU, I'M GOING TO TELL YOU THE
 SCENARIO.
 I MET A GUY AT A PARTY LAST
 MONTH.
 HE IS SO FINE.
 LIKE WINE.
 WE'VE BEEN TALKING FOR A LITTLE
 WHILE OR WHATEVER.
 I GOT HIS INSTAGRAM.
 I JUST WANT TO NO, IS IT OKAY TO
 ASK HIM OUT ON A DATE?
 Wendy: I DON'T LIKE WHEN
 PEOPLE TRY TO SEE HOW GUYS OR
 GIRLS SHOULD BE.
 YOU CAN BE CASUAL AND JUST SAY,
 "HEY, WANT TO CATCH A MOVIE?"
 YOU CAN JUST SAY, "IT DOESN'T
 HAVE TO BE NO MORE THAN THAT.
 [APPLAUSE]
 HEY, GIRL.
 HI, KEKE!
 MY NAME IS AMANDA.
 HOW YOU DOIN'?
 Keke: I'VE GOT TO BE MIXED
 THAT SOMEHOW.
 HOW YOU DOIN'?
 [LAUGHTER]
 I'VE GOT AN EX-BOYFRIEND,
 HE'S REALLY NICE.
 HE ALWAYS REACHES OUT AND CALLS
 ME, BUT MY BOYFRIEND DOESN'T
 LIKE IT AND DOESN'T WANT ME TO
 TALK TO HIM AT ALL.
 WHO'S RIGHT?
 Keke: WHEN YOU'RE IN A
 RELATIONSHIP, I FEEL LIKE YOU
 HAVE TO RESPECT WHATEVER THE
 OTHER PERSON'S BOUNDARIES ARE
 WITHIN REASON.
 YOU GET WHAT I'M SAYING?
 IF YOU REALLY LOVE THE GUY THAT
 YOU'RE WITH, YOU RESPECT HIM --
 HAVE YOU BEEN TOGETHER A WHILE?
 FOUR YEARS.
 FOR USE WITH THEIR CURRENT
 GUIDE.
 DID YOU TELL HIM THAT YOUR
 BOYFRIEND -DID YOU TELL HIM
 THAT, LET HIM KNOW?
 "NOTHING AGAINST YOU, BUT THIS
 IS MAKING MY RELATIONSHIP
 UNCOMFORTABLE."
 HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF DOING THAT?
 I TOLD HIM, BUT...
 Keke: BUT HE KEPT GOING?
 WHO BROKE UP WITH WHO?
 I BROKE UP WITH HIM.
 Keke: GIRL, WE'VE GOT TO
 GO.
 BECAUSE HE'S TRYING TO SABOTAGE!
 NO, LOVE!
 [APPLAUSE]
 IF YOU'RE HAPPY WITH THE GUY YOU
 ARE WITH, RESPECT HIS WISHES AND
 TRY TO BACK OFF OF IT.
 ALL RIGHT?
 YES!
 MORE "ASK A KEKE" IS N KEKE" IS.
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 Keke: WE ARE BACK.
 TIME FOR MORE "ASK KEKE."
 WHAT'S YOUR QUESTION?
 HEY, KEKE, HOW YOU DOIN'?
 MY NAME IS DANIELLE.
 I HAVE A BROTHER ABOUT FIVE AND
 HALF YEARS YOUNGER THAN ME.
 EVERY TIME YOU'RE TOGETHER WE
 ARGUE AND BICKER.
 MY QUESTION IS, HOW CAN WE BUILD
 OUR RELATIONSHIP SO WE DON'T
 ARGUE AND BICKER?
 THE ONE THAT'S A HARD ONE.
 I HAVE YOUNGER SIBLINGS, AS
 WELL.
 THERE SEVEN YEARS YOUNGER.
 WHEN YOU GET FIVE TO SEVEN
 THERE'S A GENERATIONAL GAP.
 A LOT OF THE TIMES THE THINGS
 YOU THINK ABOUT AND WHERE YOU
 ARE IN YOUR LIFE ARE TWO TOTALLY
 DIFFERENT THINGS.
 WHEN IT COMES TO THE YOUNGER
 SIBLINGS, SOMETIMES YOU'VE GOT
 TO BE PATIENT.
 SOMETIMES YOU REALLY WANT TO LET
 ME KNOW BUT THEMSELVES, BUT THEY
 HAVEN'T REACHED THE MATURITY
 LEVEL TO RELIEVE AND GATHER WHAT
 THEY ARE SAYING.
 I WOULD SAY, TAKE IT EASY ON
 THEM.
 BE A LITTLE BIT MORE PATIENT.
 TRY TO MAKE YOURSELF AVAILABLE
 TO THE SINK SEASON TWO.
 IF IT'S THAT IMPORTANT TO YOU.
 YOU ARE THE OLDER ONE, SO YOU
 HAVE TO BE MORE MATURE.
 [APPLAUSE]
 THANK YOU!
 HEY, KEKE!
 MY NAME IS BARBARA.
 HOW YOU DOIN'?
 I'VE BEEN WITH MY FIANCE FOR TEN
 YEARS, ENGAGE FOR TWO.
 RECENTLY I'VE BEEN TRYING TO
 MAKE WEDDING PLANS BUT HE KEEPS
 ON BRUSHING THEM OFF.
 NOW HE'S TELLING ME HE DOESN'T
 WANT TO GET MARRIED BUT HE WANTS
 TO STAY TOGETHER.
 WHAT SHOULD I DO?
 Keke: YOU BEEN TOGETHER FOR
 TEN YEARS?
 WHEN HE PROPOSED TO YOU --
 I PROPOSE TO HIM.
 [AUDIENCE REACTS]
 Keke: WHAT I'M GETTING AT
 IS THAT MARRIAGE IS A HARD LINE
 FOR YOU?
 WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT YOURSELF,
 YOU REALLY WANT TO    TO BE MAR?
 YES.
 Keke: THEN YOU HAVE TO MAKE
 A DECISION.
 BECAUSE YOU BEEN WITH THIS
 PERSON FOR TEN YEARS, GIVE HIM
 TEN YEARS OF YOUR LIFE.
 YOU PROPOSED IT TO HIM, WHICH
 SHOWS IT WAS MORE SOMETHING YOU
 WANT TO DO THAN I AM.
 AND HE'S BEING HONEST WITH YOU,
 LETTING HIM KNOW THAT HE DIDN'T
 PROPOSE.
 AND WHEN YOU PROPOSE, HE LET YOU
 KNOW THAT IT'S NOT REALLY WHAT
 HE WANTS.
 SO YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF --
 IS IT OKAY?
 IS THE COMPANIONSHIP WITH THIS
 PERSON MORE IMPORTANT THAN WHAT
 I REALLY TRULY WANT?
 IT'S ALL ABOUT BOUNDARY LINES.
 IF THIS IS A HARD LINE FOR YOU,
 YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.
 [APPLAUSE]
 THANK YOU.
 Keke: IT'S A HARD ONE.
 WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
