- Your record hasn't been that good, you know? 
- I know. 
- But you changed. 
- The warm-up, you have this guy here. 
- Hey, you trying to take my brother's job? 
- Nah, nah. Why don't you get a haircut though? 
- I don't have the means. I only have 75¢ on me. This is the courtroom of Judge Frank Caprio, where people and cases are met with compassion. A different kind of judge. A courtroom like no other. This is Caught in Providence. 
- Bertrand Brousseau. 
- Morning, Your Honor. 
- Morning, sir. Mr. Brousseau, you have a, uh, expired meter ticket on Angel Street. 
- I paid that three times. 
- (laughing) 
- Three times, and number-
- Let me just give you a little quick rundown. 
- All right. 
- My daughter works on top of the bookstore on Thayer Street. 
- Yeah, okay. 
- All right, third floor. Her office is up there. It was the day before her birthday. I went to drop something off to her. I-
- She was busy. I know that. So I just dropped it off. Took me 30 seconds. 30 seconds to get down the stairs, up the stairs. But anyways, um-
- 
- You sure it wasn't 15 seconds? 
- I-
- It was closer than that. I'm handicapped. But, uh, anyways, the, uh... the meter had expired. And I had put eight quarters in the stupid thing and it still didn't go anywhere. I put a sign on it... broken meter. The lady tagged me anyways. I went and found her. I was probably in that office 15 minutes. I said, you know, what is-
- so, anyways. But they were chasing me and I kept paying 25, 25, 25. It never got caught up. I gave 'em 50 already. 
- (chuckling) 
- I think-
- No, I think I gave 'em 75. 
- Thought you gave 50. 
- No, some-
- well, somebody. 
- No, don't fight with a judge. 
- All right, whatever you say. Anyways, Your Honor-
- 
- All right, well, let me tell-
- Let me tell you what happened. You got the ticket, right? 
- Yeah. 
- And you paid it. 
- Yeah. 
- But when you paid it, 14 days had expired. Listen to me. 14 days. They give you 14 days to pay the ticket. 
- Okay. 
- If you don't pay it in 14 days, it doubles. So what happened was the ticket doubled 'cause you didn't pay it in 14 days, so you paid $25. 
- Right. 
- Right? Then they sent you a notice saying, You owe us another 25 'cause you paid that one late. Then you didn't pay that one for 14-
- Then you waited 14 days and you paid that one. So they took that 25 and they sent you another notice saying, You paid the second 25, but you didn't do it within 14 days. 
- It's worse than Bank of America, you know what I mean? 
- You're gonna pay 25 for the rest of your life every two weeks. 
- Right, exactly. 
- All right, I'm gonna dis-
- I'm gonna dismiss the balance. 
- All right. 
- Not only that, I'm gonna give you a credit. I'm gonna give you a credit for the extra 25 that you paid. 
- All right. 
- Because you have a red light violation. 
- There you go. 
- This is on Smith and River. 
- Right. 
- Do you wanna tell me anything about that? 
- Yeah, I'm gonna tell you about that. I was on my way-
- 
- It's your daughter again. I can tell. 
- No, listen. I was on my way to, uh, say a prayer for you and for everybody, to Saint Jude Novena up on... on, uh, Chatham Street. 
- You prayed for me? 
- Yeah, of course. And, uh... anyways. The, uh-
- I had bad news from my doctor. 
- If he's praying for me, he's gotta go back, do a little more. 
- Listen, I had bad, bad news from my doctor. I was stopped at the red light, first of all, and I'm looking at it. I wasn't texting. I was just looking to see what the-
- what I had to pick up and stuff. And then I see the light's green, so-so I put it down, then all the sudden it turned red, boom. 52 years I wait my life to see you. 
- (chuckling) 
- 52 years. 
- You never had a-
- 
- And I'm-
- And I'm French. 
- You never had a moving violation? 
- Never, never. Except for that stupid parking ticket over there. I thought they were gonna hang me for that. 
- We're gonna take a look at it, Mr. Brousseau, okay? We're gonna take-
- 
- Oh, no, I definitely-
- I definitely went through it. 
- Well, let me take a look at it. 
- Okay, if you want. The light is yellow. It's red. Boy, you were speeding. 
- No, I wasn't. 
- Wow. How fast was he going? 
- (man) 34. You were doing 34 miles an hour. Look at that. 
- Maybe I did go through it. I don't know why I'm arguing with you. Anyways. 
- Wait a minute. You just said to me you were looking down. 
- What I thought, yeah. 
- You went right through the light. 
- Saint-
- Saint Jude wasn't driving, right? 
- No, Saint Christopher, he jumped out of the car a long time ago. 
- (Quinn) He jumped out? He saw you were driving, he jumped out. 
- Inspector Quinn, we have the-
- we have the Saint Jude defense today. 
- (Bertrand) Anyway. 
- You keep looking. 
- I don't know. Now I can't even see my car. 
- Anything else you wanna tell me? 
- Nah, just tell me how much. 
- All my friends are Italian. They all grab my money. You know what I mean? 
- Ohh... 
- (chuckling) 
- Your Honor, you're doing a good job. And these-
- the warm-up, you have this guy here, I don't know how come he gets paid but to warm-
- warm us up. 
- (Quinn) Wow. He's the warm-up. 
- Now you're-
- Now you're, uh, buttering me up. 
- Yeah, there you go. I want his job. Look at all the-
- 
- (Judge Caprio) Oh, yeah, now. 
- Look at the electricity we're paying for. 
- Now you're-
- It's my brother. 
- Ahh, that's why. 
- You're trying to take my brother's job? 
- Nah, nah. Why don't you get a haircut though? Ooh. 
- You guys are tough on all these other people. Be tough on me. Arrest me. 
- The parking ticket has been-
- has been paid. I'm gonna dismiss that. 
- Okay. 
- All right. The red light violation. It's your first one in 52 years. 
- Yeah. 
- You paid $25 extra for the, uh... for the parking ticket. So here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna charge you $35 court costs on the red light, give you a $25 credit that you paid for the parking ticket. So it's gonna cost you $10. 
- For the whole thing? And hey, give me the 10. 
- (Quinn) Your Honor-
- 
- Give me the 10 out of your pocket. You said it'd be less than that. 
- Good luck. 
- Thank you, Your Honor. 
- (laughing) 
- Even though Mr. Brousseau is French and Joe is Italian, they have one thing in common. They love to bust ba-
- excuse me-
- bust chops. 
- Hey, there you go. I want his job. 
- Now you're-
- It's my brother. 
- Ahh, that's why. 
- You trying to take my brother's job? 
- Nah, nah. Why don't you get a haircut though? Ooh! 
- When's the last time you had a brain scan? Kid looks like a movie star-
- one that gets killed in the first act. 
- They are definitely brothers from another mother. Mr. Brousseau, I have known Joe for over 20 years, and trust me, it will take more than a prayer to Saint Jude to get the 10 bucks from him. It will take a miracle. See, I can bust ba-
- excuse me-
- chops too. 
- I was fired from my job. 
- You're in jeopardy now of having the second car forfeited to a tow company. 
- They asked me if they could take the car. I told them no, so I believe they did it without my permission. With Advil Liqui-Gels, you'll ask... What stiff joints? What bad back? Advil is...

- Lisa Pearson. Lisa, you're charged with going through a red light on Service Road 8 and Broadway... on July 15th. Let's take a look at this. Light is yellow. It's red. And you almost made it. Red, Your Honor, now. Here's her vehicle. See where your vehicle is? And the light just turned red. 
- First of all, I'd like to let you know that I'm on disability. Second of all, I had my niece and my nephew over, and I believe they took my car because I haven't had any violations on my license in at least five to seven years. So they asked me if they could take the car. I told them no, so I believe they did it without my permission. And I believe that he's the one 'cause I don't recall going through no red light. 
- This was at, uh, like, 5:00 in the evening. Would that be you? 
- Yeah, I-
- no. I don't believe it was me. I believe the kids took the car. I call them kids 'cause they're younger than me. 
- Yeah. 
- But, uh... But, uh... 
- You also have a ticket for parking in a loading zone on Union Street. I'm gonna dismiss the loading zone ticket. 
- Thank you, Your Honor. 
- But when your name came up, they picked put his old ticket. I'm gonna dismiss it. 
- Oh, thank you so much. 
- All right, now we have to get back to the big-
- big guns here. This red light violation, okay? I believe you, all right? But here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna charge you $35 court costs, and get it from them. You hear me? 
- Yes. 
- 'Cause you are responsible if someone who drives your car-
- 
- Your Honor, I can't afford it really because I'm on disability. And I only have, uh, 75¢ on me until my check comes the 1st. I don't have any money. And then I-
- I bought my car, and, uh, I-
- 
- Lisa, Lisa, Lisa, Lisa. I-
- I'm dismissing it. 
- Oh, God bless you. Thank you, Your Honor. 
- And good luck. 
- I really, really appreciate letting me be able to not have to pay the fine because I... I don't have the means. 
- All right, it's okay. 
- I'm struggling. And I'm trying to get my condition together with my disability, so... 
- (Judge Caprio) Good luck. 
- ...I'm trying my best. Good luck to you. 
- Thank you so much again. 
- Bye-bye. 
- Have a great day. 
- Patricia Lovely. 
- Morning. 
- Morning, Patricia. You have two red light violations and three parking tickets. 
- I thought I was coming in because I hadn't gotten a ticket in so long and I was going to talk to you about the good driver thing, and then-
- 
- Yeah. 
- I-
- then-
- 
- You got two red lights. 
- I know. 
- I'm gonna dismiss one. 
- Okay, thank you so much. 
- All right, now what do you want to tell me about the parking tickets? 
- Just that, you know, I-I-
- It was right when they started doing that thing where they-
- you had a parking spot and you had pay down the street somewhere, and I had no idea how to do that. 
- Oh, the multi-spacace meter. 
- Yeah. But I did do it, and I know that that was this-
- it was back then when they started doing that and I didn't know anything about all that. 
- Well, they got 'em at three different locations. It's not one location. 
- I know, I know. No, I know. I'm bad-
- it's my bad. I'm just really happy to-
- I wanna clear my slate. 
- Are you ready to confess? 
- I am. I feel like this is confession. 
- Inspector Quinn, we have a confession. 
- (laughing) Your Honor, it's been a while since I've been to confession, so, uh... 
- (Judge Caprio) Oh. ...I can't fault the motorist. 
- Well, while you're confessing, we have a number of unsolved crimes upstairs. Do you wanna confess to any of those? We could clear them all out. 
- Okay. 
- What do you think, Inspector Quinn? 
- That-
- I will accept that confession, Your Honor, all day long, to clear the desk. 
- All right, I'm gonna fine you $85 for one of the red lights and $30 for one of the parking tickets. 
- I appreciate that. 
- So it's gonna cost you $115. 
- Okay, thank you very, very much, sir. 
- Good luck to you. 
- Okay. 
- I know you can't be his girlfriend because basketball is his girlfriend. If I was standing next to you, I wouldn't wear that T-shirt. 
- Thank you. 
- Donna Morales. Good morning, Donna. 
- Good morning. 
- Donna, your car was, uh... towed. It was booted first. It wasn't paid. As a result, it got towed. 
- Correct. 
- The car got towed... last month? 
- Yes. 
- Why did it take you a month to come in here on this? 
- Well, Your Honor, I just, uh-
- I was fired from my job. I didn't have a job. Um-
- 
- No. Well, let me go through this. Your car was booted... two months ago? 
- No, that's, um, the Nissan. I have my Infinity that was just booted last week. 
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute. There are two vehicles here? 
- Yes, two vehicles, but-
- 
- Let me go through this slowly. The first vehicle is a Nissan. I'm just-
- I just know what I have before me. 
- Correct. 
- It appears that that car was blooted-
- booted a couple of months ago. 
- Correct. 
- And then towed. 
- Correct. 
- It's still at the tow company? 
- Correct. 
- Are you here for that vehicle? 
- No, I'm not. Unfortunately, I-
- The reason why it got towed and I didn't come in-
- I was not able to register. I was in the process of registering. I bought it from a dealer off of the Internet. And something was wrong with the title that-
- so it looked like three people were on there. I was dealing with Miss Mancini from the DMV. She said, unfortunately, we couldn't get it registered. 
- Oh, you bought a car. To use-
- To use the street language, the car was a gaffe, right? 
- Basically, yes. And-
- 
- So, all right. They had trouble with the title. You bought it online. You couldn't get it cleared. All right, I understand all that. So you forfeited that car. 
- Right. 
- The tow guys got it, right? 
- Right, so that's why I didn't. 
- So you said, Keep it. I don't care about it. 
- 'Cause you can't-
- the DMV said I can't register it. 
- And... on the Infinity, you had 11 tickets. None of which were paid. Most of them were overnight parking outside your house. 
- Yes, Your Honor. My landlord, uh-
- I tried to file for the, um-
- to see if I can get the overnight parking ticket, but because we-
- there's six apartments in my house, the landlord had to go down and do something, they said. He finally just did it now. And I lost my job. That's why I didn't come in. I'm just back to work, so now I can take care of the parking tickets and everything. I'm not here to give you an excuse. I'm fully responsible for it and willing to pay. 
- All right, Donna, you're in jeopardy now of having the second car towed and forfeited to a tow company. 
- Correct. 
- So what do you wanna tell me about these? Did you come prepared today to-
- prepared to pay-
- to pay for the boot to be released? 
- I have right now $300, Your Honor, that I can give, and then I could come back every week and make a payment towards them tickets-
- 
- Your record hasn't been that good. You know that? 
- I know, I know. 
- But you changed. 
- I-I have a good job. I lost my job. I got a-
- I'm back to work. I am not losing-
- I'm not gonna lose my job. I have no other choice. But... But I will be making the payments, Your Honor. 
- In your defense... In your defense... 'cause I really wanna be fair with you, okay? Almost all of these tickets are parking in front of your house overnight. And I have some sympathy for you because of that. 'Cause we have an ordinance in Providence that you cannot park overnight on the streets in Providence. And I know that many-
- many landlords don't have sufficient number of parking spaces for their tenants and the tenants have no choice but to park on the street. All right, the original tickets are $835. The original tickets. All right, I'm gonna dismiss a number of the tickets on Monticello Street. It's gonna cost you a $100 boot fee, $300 for the tickets, and I'm gonna release the boot as soon as you pay the 300, which will be today, okay? 
- Okay. 
- You have a $100 balance. You're gonna have a $100 balance. 
- Okay. 
- Try to pay that as quick as possible so that you can buy a parking pass so you can park the car in front of your house for a year. Okay, so as soon as you pay the other 100, you'll be eligible to buy a parking pass. 
- Okay, I can pay that next Friday, Your Honor. Thank you so much. 
- Good luck. 
- Thank you. 
- I'm trying to help you to help yourself, so, please, help yourself. 
- I definitely will. I definitely will be here Friday to pay that $100. 
- Okay, good luck to you. 
- Thank you so much. 
- Good luck. 
- Thank you. 
- Rayelle Fernandez. This is a parking ticket on Benevolent Street. 
- Yes, I never received it. I just received the paper in the mail, so we came in today to take care of it. 
- All right. So you're looking to waive the penalties. 
- Yes, sir. 
- Yes. 
- All right. Who was driving the car? 
- He was. 
- (Judge Caprio) You? 
- Yes, sir. I was at work. I work for a moving company. 
- Now who's this? 
- This is Rayelle. 
- I'm the owner of the car. 
- Are you friendly? 
- Yeah. 
- Oh. I work for a moving company. 
- I know you can't be his girlfriend because basketball is his girlfriend. 
- No. 
- I mean, I'm not sure-
- I don't want to get involved here in any personal matters, all right? 
- No, I coach basketball, sir. 
- Well... 
- I coach. 
- You know, just in case she was disillusioned, thinking that she had a chance here, right? His girlfriend is basketball, so-
- And he's proud of it. See, so, I don't know. If I was standing next to you, I wouldn't wear that T-shirt. 
- Thank you. 
- Well, I think you should discuss this after you leave. If you need a mediator, I'll mediate it, okay? 
- (Rayelle) Okay. 
- All right. But I'm gonna waive the penalties. 
- Thank you. 
- So she did a good job talking for you. I'd change that shirt. All right, it's $20. 
- Thank you. 
- Thanks a lot, Your Honor.

- I was set up. The guy who was crossing was an undercover cop. 
- Undercover cops, they-
- they count as human beings, too. 
- I witnessed something that I thought was both racist and classist. 
- I took one of the plates from my old car and put it on the new car. 
- You put it on two cars? 
- Yeah. 
- You convicted yourself now. This is the courtroom
