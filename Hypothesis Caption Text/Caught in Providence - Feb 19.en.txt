of it. 
- She got the parking tickets. She had a slight stroke. We didn't know that she was gonna be admitted. She's a fighter. 
- I have a note, Inspector Quinn, from Ms. Yuridia. I'm not guilty, and I don't have money. 
- That gentleman had the same note. That gentleman had the same note. She had the same note. 
- This is the courtroom of Judge Frank Caprio, where people and cases are met with compassion. A different kind of judge. A courtroom like no other. This is Caught in Providence. 
- Yuridia Mesure. 
- Good morning, sir. 
- Good morning. Oh, you're charged with... failing to yield the right of way in a crosswalk. 
- Yeah, I think I not guilty because I see the-
- the old woman and I see her when she wanna try to pass but she is stopping, she is stopping. I think she wanna pass. That's why I'm going. Not pulling-
- and I'm sorry. 
- I think you should plead not guilty, come back and have a trial. Can you do that? 
- I-
- when-
- I come back? 
- Yeah. 
- I'm sorry, I can't come back because I-
- I lose hour in my job for I had to come here. I lose hour in my job. 
- What do you do? 
- I am a CNA. C-A-
- CNA. CNA, yeah. I take care to the old people at home, you know, and I had to go later. The people, they need me in the morning. 
- Do you have any children? 
- Oh yes. I have three-
- three kids. One is in college, and I help to the college, and I pay the taxes, I pay the house. Everything. It's not easy. But I'm gonna try doing the life the best I can. 
- I have a note, Inspector Quinn, from Ms. Yuridia. She, uh... she failed to come to court and she got... ... she was violated and as her excuse to come back in she says, Please. I'm not guilty, and I don't have money. 
- Your Honor, that gentleman had the same note. That gentleman had the same note. She had the same note. 
- You have the same note? 
- Oh, every day when I wake up, Judge, I put it on top of my wall so my daughters and my wife can read that. 
- That's everybody in this time. 
- Exactly. 
- It's hard. The food is very expensive, the tax-
- everything is expensive. And the kids, when they grow up, they eat more food. 
- Oh, the kids are sending you broke. They've got big appetites, huh? 
- Yeah, exactly. And they not give me food stamp, they not give me nothing. And I take nothing. 
- Who does the cooking, you? 
- Yes, I cook. I am a good cooking. 
- What's the best thing you make? 
- Rice and beans and chicken. 
- Rice, beans and chicken. 
- Yes, they like it. 
- Inspector Quinn's mouth is salivating. Look at him. You like rice, beans and chicken, Inspector Quinn? 
- I have yet to have it, Judge. 
- I'm sure. 
- Chicken I'm familiar with. 
- I'm sure. 
- And I start to cook it when I-
- I had nine years old and I start to cook it. 
- You started cooking at nine? 
- At nine years old. 
- So you've been cooking for five years? 
- No, I... And a little kid in my-
- in my country. 
- All right, you're gonna pay $35 court cost. 
- I pay right now, no problem. Thank you so much. 
- Be careful. 
- Yes. 
- When you get to intersections, if there's anybody in the crosswalk, stop. Even if they're like one step into the crosswalk, stop. 
- Okay. 
- They're out there. 
- Okay, no more. 
- No more, right? All right. Gerald Lewis. 
- Yeah, Mr. Lewis is present. 
- Good morning, sir. 
- Good morning, sir. 
- Get closer to the mic, Mr. Lewis. Thank you. 
- Good morning, Your Honor. 
- Mr. Lewis has been observed speeding in a school zone at 1:55 p.m. Do you wanna be heard, sir? 
- Yes, if I may, Your Honor? So I met Mr. Lewis at Operation Stand Down roughly a month ago, and he explained the situation to me. Mr. Lewis served six years in the Marines. Directly following that, he served one year in the Army and Operation Desert Storm, and on the day at hand, Mr. Lewis was actually heading to-
- I'm sorry-
- coming from the VA hospital. He had severe pain his back and was suffering from a hernia and they treat him as well as they could and they had put a follow-up-date offer for the treatment, and on the way home Mr. Lewis passed through the school zone and that's where this incident occurred. In terms of the prior court date that he missed, Mr. Lewis confused the follow-up appointment at the VA hospital with the court date given that, you know, the incidences were from the same day. So, Your Honor, with that being said, you know, Mr. Lewis has served our country, and we ask you that, with all that he's done, that you dismiss this fine. 
- All right, not with-
- not withstanding that, the motorist is charged with doing one mile over what the city prosecutes for. The city does not prosecute if you're doing 11 miles over. But there's-
- the statute provides that the city has the discretion to charge plus or minus one mile per hour. 
- I see. 
- So I have routinely dismissed cases where the motorist was doing 11 miles over. He was doing 12 miles over, so the issue that I have to resolve in my mind is does his service to the country and his... position currently, does that justify me giving him a break for one mile over? And based on your argument, I find that it does, so the matter will be dismissed. 
- Great, thank you, Your Honor. 
- Okay, good job. How long did you prepare for this? 
- Uh... saying it to myself in the mirror on the car ride here. 
- Well, you can do that for traffic cases. When you get to-
- when you get to the felonies, you better spend-
- you better spend some-
- some time looking in the mirror for a week before. Good luck, you did a good job. 
- Thank you very much, Your Honor, appreciate it. 
- Thank you, Your Honor. 
- I was really drunk. 
- Did you speak to the police when they came? 
- If I did, I don't remember. 
- You allow her to use the vehicle occasionally? 
- Sometimes. 
- All right. 
- When she's good. 
- And I'm always good. <i> Reese's eggs are back</i> <i> and we hid them</i> <i> somewhere you'll never find...</i> <i> Sike!

- Kimberly Allovera. 
- Good morning. 
- This your lawyer? 
- My husband. 
- Oh, your husband. Okay. Uh, why don't you guys get two separate mics, okay? I know-
- I know you're a very close family and you wanna stay close together, right. All right, now, I'm gonna take a guess. You were driving the vehicle. 
- She was. 
- Inspector Quinn, I started off wrong. You-
- you allow her to use the vehicle occasionally? 
- Sometimes. 
- It's a pretty-
- 
- When she's good. 
- And I'm always good. 
- Pretty fancy SUV. Let's see. You're charged with parking in a prohibited area on Fifth Street. 
- Yes. My grandmother-
- 
- I mean, I know why you're here, incidentally. 
- I don't know why either. 
- I know why you're here. You're here to pay, you're here to pay. 
- To pay, yeah. 
- That's why you're here. Who's gonna pay, you or him? 
- He is. 
- He is. 
- She does the crime and I pay for it. 
- I swear, she's completely relaxed, she don't care. 
- Hey, that was the arrangement. 
- All right, what happened? 
- That's the benefits of being married. 
- How many children do you have? 
- We have two now. 
- Yeah. Well, you're charged with parking in a prohibited area on Fifth Street. That's up near Miriam Hospital. What do you wanna tell me about it? 
- Well, it was a-
- it was a very busy day that day. I was actually following my mother, because I didn't know how to get to the hospital-
- 
- Oh, now you're throwing your mother under the bus. 
- I know. I have to because it's part of-
- I don't understand why I got the ticket and nobody else did. 
- All right. 
- But my grandmother had been admitted the night before, so I was going to help my mother out. So I followed her into two parking lots. There was no place to park. Valet was out in the street. So we parked on the street I followed her to. We parked there, there was a delivery truck in front of us, we went in, she asked the valet if it was okay to be parked there. He said it was okay as long as it was less than two hours. So I made sure it was less than two hours, but when I came out, I had a ticket. Her car was still there, she did not have a ticket. 
- Well, I have a photograph of the area and a photograph of your car, and there is a delivery truck in front of you and-
- 
- Yeah, I think it was only within ten minutes I got that ticket, according to the stamp that was on it, the time stamp. 
- And next to the delivery truck is a pole with signs on it, which are not visible in the photograph. So what do you think, Inspector Quinn? 
- Your Honor, the signs on the pole say, No parking anytime. Deliveries between 8:00 and 4:00. 
- Does it really? 
- Your Honor, there's no way I could've read that sign. The photo the city provided, Your Honor, does not allow me the ability to read the times on the sign. 
- Okay. Okay, so you're following your mother to the hospital because your grandmother was in the hospital, right? You asked the valet, Where can I park? He says, Park over there. You said to him, Are you sure? He says, Sure I'm sure-
- he don't care. 
- Right. 
- He don't care. He figures, I'm gonna get rid of her, right? I've got other stuff to do. Park anywhere you want. And then you drag your husband into court. 
- Yeah. He wanted to come. 
- You guys get along pretty good. You're recently married? 
- No. 37 years. 
- How many? 
- 37 years? 
- I feel your pain. Same thing. 
- It's been good so far. 
- I'm gonna ask you a question. 
- Okay. 
- This is a family joke and I'll explain it after I finish. How many years have you been happily married? You don't have to answer. 
- You don't have to-
- you don't have to answer. 
- Well, it's like a hill, up and down. 
- It's up and down, it's like this. Peaks and valleys. 
- Yeah. 
- Okay. That's life, life is peaks and valleys. But my wife and I have been married 50 years, and every time... 
- God bless you. 
- ... we meet people, I'll introduce people, and I'll say-
- I want to introduce my-
- they say, Oh, how long have you been married? I say, Oh, we've been happily married for five years. And they say, Oh, is this your second or third wife? No, no, no, no, no. Inspector Quinn, who is the prosecuting officer, said he can't read the sign. So if he can't read the sign, the city can't prove its case. If the city can't prove its case, the matter's gonna be dismissed. You just saved 30 bucks. 
- Thank you, I appreciate it. 
- Take her to breakfast. 
- Now go for the $100 breakfast. 
- Thank you. 
- Thank you. 
- Have a good day. 
- Julio Franco. 
- Good morning, Your Honor. 
- Good morning, Mr. Franco. You have two parking tickets. They're both on Blackstone Street. Is there anything you wanna tell me about these? 
- Um... 
- Speak into the mic, please. 
- I'm here on behalf of Sandra Desisto. Um... she got the parking tickets. She had a slight, uh... stroke. We didn't know that she was gonna be admitted, and we were there overnight. Actually, we were there two days. When I came out, the car had the boot on it. It was $368 to have the boot taken off. I thought that by paying to have the boot taken off that the tickets would be included. 
- Well, they were... The tickets up to that time were included. When, uh, when was the boot taken off? What day was that taken off? 
- The same day. 
- What date, do you know? 
- August 7th. 
- You paid to have the boot removed, and you paid for all the tickets? 
- Yes. 
- I think you suffered enough. 
- Thank you. 
- How's she doing? 
- Um, she's doing all right. She's having therapy and, um... she's a fighter. 
- Well, she's got a good friend with you. She's lucky to have you. 
- Thank you. 
- All right, good luck. 
- The matter's dismissed. 
- Thank you very much. 
- This was at 10:41 in the evening. 
- Now, did I have a car like that? What year is that? 
- I came here to ask the questions, not to answer them. <i> Emerge Restored,</i> <i> Replenished,</i> <i> Fortified.</i> <i>Emerge everyday with Emergen-C.</i> <i> Packed with B vitamins,</i> <i> Electrolytes, Antioxidants,</i> <i> Plus more vitamin C than</i> <i> 10 oranges.</i> <i> Why not feel this good</i> <i> every day? </i> <i> Emerge and See.</i> My digestive system used to make me feel sluggish But now, I take Metamucil every day.

- Bernadette Ortiz. Okay, Bernadette, you're charged with, uh... loud music coming from your home... at 3:30 in the morning. Was you having a party? 
- I was having a get-together. 
- What was the occasion? 
- Just celebrating. 
- A bunch of friends. 
- Just a little get-together, people over. 
- How many people in the house? 
- 12 or so. 
- Well, you have two choices. You can pay a... you can plead guilty today and I'll impose a fine, or you can come back and have a trial. Is there anything you wanna tell me about it? 
- It was just a simple-
- we was drinking, I got drunk, and... I blacked out. Don't remember much of it. 
- You blacked out? 
- Yeah, I don't remember the cops coming and stuff, so-
- 
- But did you-
- 
- I was really drunk. 
- Did you speak to the police when they came in? 
- If I did, I don't remember. 
- Oh, you don't remember what you said. 'Cause there's a police report on this and... I'm not gonna read the police report. Okay. I'm sure you probably said, Listen, sir, I'm sorry. You know, we're just having some friends getting together, and I realize, Officer, you have a tough job and please show us some mercy. I think-
- I think that's what you said to the police officer, right? 
- I hope so. 
- Something like that. What do you think, Inspector Quinn? Is that what she said? 
- If you had to read that report, it sounds like-
- 
- We're not reading the report. We're not gonna-
- we're not gonna do that to her. 
- Your version of that report, I have yet to read that. 
- She comes across, she's very honest, she said, Listen, I had too much to drink. I had some friends, the cops came. Maybe I said some stuff that was inappropriate but that's not really me. 
- Right. 
- Is that what you wanted to say? 
- Perfect, it's on point. 
- All right. Now, that's what you wanted-
- now, what are you really thinking? 
- I was wondering what I really said. 
- Well, there's a $500 fine here, so how do you plead: guilty or not guilty? 
- I would say guilty with an explanation, which I just gave, so-
- 
- Yeah. I don't know, Inspector Quinn. I think we have to fine her. But I just dropped one of the zeros, so it's gonna cost you $50. 
- Thank you. 
- And-
- 
- I thought you dropped the zero after the decimal point. 
- Now, there were 13 people at the party, right? 
- Yeah. We-
- we was all just having fun. It got out of hand, I guess, 'cause after a few drinks-
- 
- I think you better-
- I think you better call them up and tell them-
- 
- I'm gonna start charging $25 a head or something from them. 
- It's a $50 fine, right, so call them up and tell them they owe $4 each. They all have to participate in the fine, right? 
- Yes. 
- Okay, good luck to you. 
- Thank you. 
- When you come to court, you are required to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. But nowhere do we ask that you over share. 
- I was eight months pregnant and I had to pee. 
- Yeah, I was over my girlfriend's house. 
- And I just had my-
- some surgery, my fingers amputated. 
- While we appreciated Ms. Ortiz's honesty when she admitted that she got blackout drunk, she could have simply said that she was overserved; a phrase that I'm occasionally required to employ.

- Cornelius Adams. Good morning, sir. 
- Good morning. 
- Okay, you have five different registrations. 
- Yeah, I got three cars. 
- You're a three-car household, huh? 
- Yeah, well, my-
- 
- What, do you use one for different days? 
- No, no, my son has one, I have one, and then my girl has one. 
- Oh, I see. 
- So they all registered my car, so... when I came to court I found out who the culprits were, so-
- 
- On the Chevrolet-
- who drives the Chevrolet? 
- That would be my son. 
- How old is your son? 
- My son is 20. He's in college right now in New Mexico. 
- Mexico? 
- Yeah, he plays football. 
- Well, I can see where he got his athletic ability from, looking at you. 
- Yeah, I went to-
- 
- His mother. 
- Yeah. Yeah, I went to Mount Pleasant. I graduated from over there '89. 
- Yeah. 
- Yeah. 
- And did you play sports after that? 
- Of course, at URI. That was back in... '90. 
- I think you should've stuck it out. You probably could've played for the Patriots. Look at the size of you. 
- Ah, prob-
- most like-
- I think my son-
- my son, most likely. 
- Okay, on the red-light ticket we're gonna take a look at it. 
- Okay. 
- This was at 10:41 in the evening. 
- Now, did I have a car like that? What year is that? 
- I came here to ask the questions, not to answer them. 
- All right, yeah, Your Honor, yeah, just curious. 
- I'm gonna dismiss the parking ticket overnight. It's gonna cost you $85 for the red light. 
- Shh... 
- Well, you got a good deal here. See the clerk. 
- Yes. Can I get a little time to come back and bring the money if I gotta pay, though? 
- Work it out-
- work it out with Alyssa. 
- All right, all right. 
- Good luck. 
- Appreciate it. Got it? Got it. Nooooo... Nooooo... <i>Quick, the Quicker Picker Upper!</i> <i> Bounty picks up messes quicker</i> <i> and is 2x more absorbent.</i> <i> Bounty, the Quicker Picker</i> <i> Upper.</i> met-
- I met your son eight years ago when he was running for governor. 
- See, what you're supposed to do is, before I make a decision, you're supposed to really butter me up. So before I made a decision on that case, you're supposed to say, I met your son, and then you-
- whatever you wanna tell me. You know, I can't stand him, or he's a good guy. Something like that. 
- It was just a pleasure. 
- Thank you for those compliments. Very nice of you. 
- Are you kidding? 
- After the cops came... 
- (Judge Caprio) Yeah? 
- ...my brother got in a fight with one of the cops. 
- Ohh! 
- Hence the ticket.
