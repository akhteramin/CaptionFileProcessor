 HUGE WIN OVER THE SIXERS.
 4 OF HIS 5 BLOCKS ON JOEL
 EMBIID.
 A LOT OF MVP VOTERS GOING INTO
■ I DON'T KNOW WHY.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS
 PERFORMANCE DID FOR THE MVP
 VOTERS?
 FOR ME,T DIDN'T DO
 ANYTHING.
 FOR ME, I WAS ALREADY VOTING FOR
 HIM.
 FOR OTHERS, IT SOLIDIFIED.
 BUT I HATE TALKING ABOUT THIS,
 BECAUSE JAMES HARDEN HAD SUCH A
 PHENOM SEASON.
 HE COULD VERY WELL BE MVP THIS
 YEAR.

 AND JAMES HARDEN, HOLDING UP
 HIS TEAM WITH CAPELA AND PAUL
 OUT.
 BUT A LOT OF BUCKS ARE OUT, TT
 THIS GAME LAST NIGHT.
 WATCHING EMBIID AND GIANNIS
 BATTLE.
 AND GIANNIS, IT'S A TIGHT GAME,
 HE WINKS AT HIS TEAMMATES, LIKE,
 I GOT THIS.
 THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO SEE.
 BACK IN 07, LeB 29 OUT
 OF 30 POINTS IN DETROIT.
 THAT WAS WHEN HE ARRIVED, AND
 UNDERSTOOD HE COULD DOMINATE A
 GAME.
 WE'RE ON THE EDGE WITH GIAN
 I THINK WE MAY SEE IT THIS
 POSTSEASON, IF HE TAKES THE
 SERIES, ESPECIALLY A ROAD GAME.
 THEY'RE BEHIND THE WHOLE GAME.
 IN PHILLY, I KNOW JIMMY BUTLER
 DIDN'T PLAY.
 BUT THAT EXCITED ME ABOUT WHEN
 LeBRON WON IN 2007, 9 OF
 NEXT 11 YEARS, LeBRON WON.
 NOW, THIS COULD BE GIANNIS
 TAKING THE TORCH.
 I'M SO EXCITED.
 AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S
 SOCIAL MEDIA OR RADIO, BUT IT
 DIDN'T USED TO FEEL TO ME, IF
  SAID YOU LIKED THISGUY,THE

 TRASH.

 THE GIANNISBLOCKS.
  PLAYED A TEAM HIGH

 ASSISTS.
 BUT SHOULD HE HAVE EVEN PLAYED
 LAST NIGHT?
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY,
 AUS THEY KEEP
 SHUT HIS EE,■# INDICATES IT'S R
 BOTHERING HIM.
 HE'S BORDERLINE HERE, GOING IN
 AND OUT OF THE GAME.
 BUT LOOKS REALLY GOOD WHEN HE
 PLAYS.
 HE WAS AWESOME IN THIS GAME.
 AND I WAS JUST AS EXCITED ABOUT
 EMBIID GOING BACK DOWN AND
 SCORING ON HIM OVER AND OVER
 AGAIN.

 THAT WAS SOME HIGH-LEVEL
 SHADE.
 SOMETHING OTHER THAN -I WAS
 VERY IMPRESSED.
 SO MUCH MORE COMING YOUR WAY.
 UP NEXT, MY CONVERSATION WITH
 DWYANE WADE, WITH THE FINAL
 GAMES OF HIS CAREER APPROACHING.
 HERE'S A LITTLE SNEAK PEEK.
 KOBE HAS SET THIS
 UNBELIEVABLE, IMPOSSIBLE BAR
 THAT PEOPLE FEEL THAT, IN YOUR
 LAST GAME, YOU HAVE TO SCORE 60.
 IF IT TURNS OUT YOU GO INTO
 THE GAME KNOWING FOR SURE YOU
 GUYS ARE OUT OF IT, ARE WE GOING
 FOR 40?
 WELL, I'M GOING TO SHOOT.

        So I can buy from
 Enterprise Car Sales and you'll take ANY trade-in?
 's right!
              Great!
          Here you go...
       Well, it does need       to be a vehicle.
     But I need this out of     my house.
   (VO) With fair, transparent   value for every trade-in...
    Enterprise makes it easy.
           Don't do it.
          Anthony Davis?
          Choose Mobil 1        Synthetic instead.
    It protects engines better   than conventional motor oil.
         Uh, my oil works       just fine thank you.
     Can it keep your engine     in excellent condition
     for over 250,000 miles?
        You know, you look        much taller on TV.
    The camera adds six feet.
    Seems like a thing people    would know. But I didn't.
        Get 250,000 miles          of protection.
       Upgrade to Mobil 1.
 SO, IT'S BEEN 16 YEARS THAT YOU'VE SEEN DWYANE WADE, HAS WON
 NBA TITLES, HE'S A 13-TIME
 ALL-STAR.
 BUT HERE'S WHAT YOU HAVEN'T
 SEEN.
 I WAS ABLE TO GO DOWN TO MIAMI
 THIS WEEKEND, AND GO INSIDE OF
 HIS HOME WITH HIS LOVELY WIFE
 AND BEAUTIFUL NEW BABY, AND TAKE
 STOCK OF WHERE HE'S BEEN THIS
 YEAR, AND WHAT HE'S LOOKING
 FORWARD TO AS HE GOES INTO
 RETIREMENT.
 IT'S BEEN A YEAR, AND ONE HE
 DIDN'T EXPECT.
 TAKE A LISTEN.
 SO, THANK YOU FOR WELCOMING US
 INTO YOUR HOME.
 I THOUGHT THIS WAS VERY
 APPROPRIATE, WHAT'S BEHIND YOU.
 I SWEAR, THE LAST COUPLE OF
 MONTHS, YOU WERE SOME OF THE
 MOST CALM AND ZEN I'VE SEEN YOU
 IN YOUR CAREER.
 WHERE ARE YOU MENTALLY?
 I'M COOL.
 I'M JUST CHILLING, JUST
 ENJOYING, LIKE, THE PROCESS.
 I'M ENJOYING THE PROCESS, LIKE,
 DAILY.
 IT IS A LOT OF LAST TIMES.
 EVERY DAY, THE LAST TIME YOU'LL
 DO THIS.
 THE LAST MEATBALL I'LL EAT IN
 THE MIAMI HEAT CAFETERIA.
 AND NONE OF THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO
 HAPPEN, YOU TOLD ME, I THINK,
 THREE TIMES LAST SUMMER, I'M
 DONE.
 I'M NOT COMING BACK FOR THIS
 LAST YEAR.
 I'M DONE.
 YOU TOLD YOUR FAMIU WERE
 DONE?
 YEAH.
 I REMEMBER TALKING, AND I WAS
 LIKE, MAN, I DON'T KNOW IF I
 WANT TO DO THIS ANYMORE.
 THEY WERE LIKE, WHAT?
 I DON'T EVEN LIKE COMING TO
 SHOOTAROUND IN THE MORNING.
 THERE WERE THINGS I STARTED NOT
 TO LIKE.
 YOU TALKED TO CARMELO
 ANTHONY, IT WAS A CONSEQUENTIAL
 DECISION.
 WHAT DID HE SAY?
 HE SAID, LET'S GET DOWN TO
 IT.
 WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
 RETIRING?
 I SAW IT IN HIS VOICE AND HIS
 EYES, HE WAS LIKE, YO, YOU CAN'T
 RETIRE AND NOT ALLOW US TO
 CELEBRATE YOU OR TO CELEBRATE
 THE CAREER YOU'VE HAD.
 TO ME, IT WAS AN EYE-OPENER.
 AND C.P. CALLED ME, AND SAID THE
 SAME THING.
 SO I SAID, LET ME THINK ABOUT
 THIS DIFFERENTLY.
 AND THE IRONY OF MELO SAYING
 THAT, HE D GETO HAVE
 THAT, AT LEAST NOT YET.

 HAVE YOU TALKED TO HIM ABOUT
 THAT?
 NOT ABOUT THAT.
 BUT I'VE WATCHED ONE OF MY
 FAVORITE PLAYERS GET PUSHED ■÷÷.
 I WATCHED IVERSON PUSHED OUT.
 I WATCHED HOW THE GAME CHANGES,
 AND HOW QUICKLY THE
 ORGANIZATION'S AND THE FAN'S
 MIND GOES TO THE NEXT PERSON.
 AND IT'S BEEN CRAZY.
 EARLIER THIS SEASON, WE GOT THE
 GREAT MOMENT IN LOS ANGELES,
 WITH LeBRON.
 VERY MOVING.
 NOVAN MITCHELL GIVES YOU A
 ROCKING CHAIR.
 YOU PLAYEDR LAST IN
 MADISON SQUARE GARDEN,■g THE CRD
 WENT INSANE FOR YOU.
 MVP CHANTS IN THE GARDEN.
 THEY CHEERED FOR YOU IN BOSTON,
 SOMETHING I THOUGHT I WOULD
 NEVER SEE.
 DANNY AINGE PRESENTED YOU WITH A
 PIECE OF THE PARQUET FLOOR.
 DID I SCORE ANY BUCKETS ON
 THAT FLOOR?
 A FEW TOO MANY.
 WE WEREN'T HAPPY.
 WHAT'S BEEN THE EXPERIENCE OF
 LIVING THROUGH THOSE MOMENTS?
 IT'S BEEN SURREAL.
 IT'S LIKE YOU HAVE THIS VISION
 OF HOW YOU WANT THINGS TO GO,
 EVERYTHING IN LIFE.
 WHEN SOMETHING SURPASSES THAT
 VISION, IT'S AN OUT OF BODY
 EXPERIENCE.
 AND THE JERSEY SWAPS HAVE
 BECOME THEIR OWN WHOLE SEPARATE
 THING.
 WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH
 THOSE JERSEYS?
 THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE.
 I NEED A SEPARATE MEMORABILIA
 HOU SOME POINT.
 AT ONE POINT, INT TO GO BACK
 AND LOOK AT WHAT WAS SAID, LOOK
 AT THE GUYS I PLAYED AGAINST.
 I WAS LIKE, WOW, THIS IS COOL,
 THIS IS SO DOPE.
 YOU KNOW.
 FOR A LONG TIME, YOU SAID YOU
 WANTED TO SPEND YOUR CAREER WITH
 MIAMI.
 YOU WENT TO CHICAGO, CLEVELAND,
 YOU CAME BACK HOME AGAIN.
 HOW IS THIS FINAL SWING WITH THE
 HEAT DIFFERENT WITH THE FACT
 THAT YOU LEFT AND CAME BACK?
 IT'S DIFFERENT FROM THE
 STANDPOINT, WHETHER IT'S ME, THE
 ORGANIZATION, THE FAN BASE, WE
 UNDERSTAND, WHEN WE DIDN'T HAVE
 EACH OTHER, HOW MUCH WE NEEDED
 EACH OTHER, AND HOW MUCH WE
 APPRECIATED WHAT EVERYBODY
 BROUGHT TO THE TABLE.
 PEOPLE SAY, I WISH IT NEVER
 HAPPENED, BUT IT WAS NEEDED TO.
 BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU
 HAVE UNTIL IT'S GONE.
 BUT WE CAME BACK TOGETHER, AND
 IT GREAT.
 A SCA MOMENT THE OTHER DAY
 AGAINST MILWAUKEE.
 IS THERE A MOMENT IN THE FINAL
 STRETCH, THE HANDFUL OF GAMES,
 DON'T GET HURT, DON'T GET HURT?
 YES.
 THAT WOULD BE SO -THAT WOULD
 HURT IN A WAY THAT, I WOULD BE
 DEPRESSED FOR A LITTLE WHILE.
 YES.
 BUT I JUST GO OUT AND PLAY.
 I'VE BEEN OUT THERE, AND I'VE
 BEEN DOING ALL RIGHT.
 AS ALWAYS.
 SO, THE WAY YOU END THE REGULAR
 SEASON, YOU HAVE BACK-TO-BACK, A
 HOME GAME AGAINST THE SIXERS,
 AND THEN YOU PLAY THE LAST NIGHT
 OF THE SEASON UP IN BROOKLYN.
 THAT COULD DETERMINE WHETHER YOU
 MAKE THE PLAYOFFS OR NOT.
 YEAH.
 LET'S TALK ABOUT THE HOME
 GAME, FIRST.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR LAST, AT
 LEAST SCHEDULED, HOME GAME IN
 MIAMI WILL FEEL LIKE?
 I DON'T KNOW.
 I HAVE NO IDEA, LIKE, IT'S
 TOUGH, RIGHT?
 BECAUSE EXACTLY WHAT I DID NOT
 WANT TO HAPPEN IS HAPPENING.
 I DID NOT WANT TO GO DOWN TO THE
 LAST COUPLE OF GAMES AND IT BE
 FOR A PLAYOFF SPOT.
 SO, THE WAY I PREPARE AND
 WILL BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT.
 YES.
 BUT FOR ME, IT'S DEFINITELY
 GOING TO BE EMOTIONAL.
 IT'S THE END OF, LIKE, THE END
 OF SOMETHING THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL.
 THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SHARE
 TOGETHER.
 AS WE'RE SITTING HERE IN YOUR
 HOUSE, YOU'VE LIVED IN HALF A
 DOZPLACES, YOU'VE BEEN AROUND
 THE WORLD, YOU'VE DONE THIS,
 YOU'VE DONE THAT.
 BUT THAT COURT, EVERY YEAR,
 SEVERAL TIMES A WEEK, YOU COME
 BACK TO THAT COURT.
 THAT COURT HAS SEEN YOU GROW UP.
 YEAH.
  WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO TO ME
 RIGHT NOW?
 WHAT IS THIS?
 MAKE YOU CRY, RNOW.
 NO, BUT THAT'S KIND OF
 ■XS MY HOUSE.
 I'M IN THAT HOUSE WAY■2■2 THAN ñ
 I'M IN THIS HOUSE.
 THAT'S WHAT I MEAN.
 IT'S DEFINITELY A BIG PART OF
 MY LIFE.
 NO ONE WANTS IT TO END.
 IT'S BEEN GREAT.
 BUT IT HAS TO.
 I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GOING TO
 CRY?
 I DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO
 CRY.
 YOU WANT TO BET?
 I DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO
 CRY.
 I ONLY CRY IN INTIMATE SETTINGS.
 LET'S TALK ABOUT THE LAST
 GAME UP IN BROOKLYN.
 YOU COULD BE VERY WELL GOING
 INTO THAT GAME, AND AS THE
 MINUTES TICK BY, YOU WON'T KNOW
 IF IT'S YOUR LAST GAME.
 I'M NOT GOING TO THINK ABOUT
 IT LIKE THAT.
 KOBE HAS SET THIS UNBELLE,
 IMPOSSIBLE BAR, PEOPLE FEEL IN
 YOUR LAST GAME, YOU HAVE TO
 SCORE 60.
 WHO DOES THAT?
 KOBE BRYANT DOES THAT.
 I'M GOING DO GO OUT THE WAY
 D-WADE WILL GO OUT.
 IT HELPS THAT WE'RE JUST TRYING
 TO WIN, IF IT WASN'T, I WOULD
 TRY TO GET 40.
 IF YOU GO INTO THE GAME,
 KNOWING FOR SURE YOU GUYS ARE
 OUT OF IT, ARE YOU GOING FOR 40?
 WELL, I'M GOING TO SHOOT.
 A LOT.
 WE'LL SEE IF IT GOES IN OR NOT.
 I WAS THINKING BACK, I'VE
 BEEN INTERVIEWING YOU SINCE YOUR
 ROOKIE YEAR,ERE BOTH
 CHILDREN.
 YOU WERE NOT THE CHOSEN ONE, THE
 GUY WHO WON MARCH MADNESS.
 YOUR PATH WAS NOT LAID OUT FOR
 YOU IN THE WAY SOME OF YOUR
 FRIENDS' WERE.
 HOW DOES IT MAKE IT SWEETER WHAT
 YOU'VE ■■ACCOMPLISHED?
 IT'S MORE OF MES OUT THERE.
 THERE ARE ONLY SO MANY LeBRON
 JAMES OUT THERE.
 BUT THERE'S WAY M DWYANE
  HE WORLD.
 I WASN'T A McDONALD'S
 ALL-AMERICAN, NO CAMPS, I GOT
 THREE SCHOLARSHIP OFFERS TO GO
 TO COLLEGE.
 BUT IT'S A BIG FAMILY TO BE A
 PART OF, AND I'M PROUD OF IT.
 SPEAKING OF THE GUYS WHO
 MAYBE HAD A LITTLE BIT MORE JUS.
 IT'S BEEN A ROUGH YEAR FOR
 LeBRON.
 YOU EVER CALL HIM, YOU CAN
 RETIRE WITH
 NO,M■ HE'S FINE.
 THE WESTERN CONFERENCE IS NO
 JOKE, INJURIES SUCK, HOPEFULLY
 HE DOESN'T EXPERIENCE ANY MORE.
 BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN IN THE
 FINALS EIGHT YEARS IN A ROW.
 AT SOME POINT, LIKE, THE
 REALIZATION WILL KNOCK YOU IN
 THE HEAD.
 NOW HE'S GOING TO REFOCUS, HE'LL
 BE FINE, THE LAKERS WILL BE
 FINE.
 I'M NOT CONCERNED WITH LeBRON
 JAMES.
 HE WILL BE FINE.
 BY THE WAY, THAT'S ANOTHER
 BET WE CAN HAVE.
 I KNOW THEIR RELATIVE AGES, BUT
 WHO WILL TAP OUT FIRST?
 C.P. OR --
 I KNEW I WAS GOING TO TAP OUT
 FIRST.
 BUT FOR THOSE GUYS, THEY DON'T
 LOOK AT THE END.
 C.P. IS STILL CHASING A
 CHAMPIONSHIP, TRYING TO GET TO
 THE FINALS.
 BRON, HE WANTS TO BE LeBRON
 JAMES FOREVER.
 AND THAT'S THE BATTLE HE WILL
 HAVE TO, AS YOU GET OLDER, YOU
 HAVE TO FIGHT TO DO THAT.
 AND MELO, HE HAS A DIFFERENT
 PATH.
 HE HAS TO GET BACK IN THIS
 LEAGUE.
 ALL OF THEM ARE CHASING
 DIFFERENT THINGS RIGHT NOW, AND
 THEY'RE IN THIS PLACE WHERE
 I'M AT.
 I'M NOT CHASING ANYTHING.
 THAT'S WHY I'M OKAY WALKING FROM
 TH BECAUSE EVERY■
 WANTED TO CHASE, I ALREADY
 GRABBED IT, AND I'VE HAD IT.
 NOW I'M LIKE, OKAY, I WANT TO DO
 SOMETHING ELSE.
 SO GOOD.
 STAY TUNED, BECAUSE COMING UP,
 WE HAVE THE SECOND PART OF THE
 CONVERSATION.
 WE'LL BE JOINED BY THE BRILLIANT
 AND BEAUTIFUL GABRIELLE UNION,
 AND THE CUTE BABY.
 GABRIELLE TELLS US WHAT MAKES
 DWYANE WADE CRY
           Don't do it.
          Anthony Davis?
          Choose Mobil 1        Synthetic instead.
    It protects engines better   than conventional motor oil.
        You know, you look        much taller on TV.
    The camera adds six feet.
        Get 250,000 miles          of protection.
       Upgrade to Mobil 1.

 HELLO, BEAUTY. HE'S NOT GOING TO CRY ABOUT
 THAT.
 YOU'RE ASKING THE WRONG
 QUESTION.
 THE SECRET TO HIS TEARS?
 MARLEY AND ME.
 I HAD SOMETHING IN MY EYE.
 I COULDN'T GET IT OUT.
 WE READ THE BOOK FIRST,
 TOGETHER.
 YOU CRIED.
 AND THEN THE MOVIE CAME OUT, AND
 YOU CRIED.
 MY EYES GOT A LITTLE MOIST.
 THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK HE WILL MISS
 THE MOST ABOUT PLAYING IN THE
 NBA?
 OH, HIS FRIENDS.
 HIS FRIENDS.
 DO YOU THINK IT WILL BE WEIRD
 FOR HIM THAT THOSE GUYS YOU
 MENTIONED WILL ALL STILL BE
 PLAYING, AND HE'S GOING TO BE
 SITTING ON THE COUCH?
 DOING THIS?
 I'M SURE THERE WILL BE TIMES
 WHERE HE ISNG TO, YOU KNOW,
 START TO DISSECT THE GAME.
 THIS IS WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE.
 BUT WE'LL FIND OUT, RIGHT?
 I'M SURE TWITTER WILL KNOW IF HE
 IS LIKE, YOU KNOW --
 YOU GOT SOMETHING YOU WANT TO
 SAY?
 YOU THINK HE WILL BE A HATER,
 HE WILL TURN INTO A HATER?
 NO.
 IT'S WEIRD WHEN PROFESSIONAL
 ATHLETES RETIRE.
 YOU'RE NOT JUST QUITTING YOUR
 JOB.
 THIS HAS DICTATED WHAT CITY YOU
 LIVE IN, WHEN YOU GO ON
 VACATION, WHEN YOU EAT, WHEN YOU
 GO TO SLEEP AND WAKE UP.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT WILL BE
 LIKE?
 I WILL BE IN THERAPY.
 NO, SERIOUSLY.
 OKAY.
 IT WILL BE A BIG CHANGE.
 I TOLD MY WIFE, I NEED TO DO
 THERAPY, WE NEED TO DO A LITTLE
 BIT.
 I WAS ALWAYS AGAINST SOMEONE
 THAT DON'T KNOW TELLING ME HOW
 TO LIVE MY LIFE, BUT I NEED
 SOMEBODY TO TALK TO ABOUT IT.
 I HAVE A LONG LIFE TO LIVE, AND
 THERE ARE OTHER GREAT THINGS TO
 ACCOMPLISH AND DO, IT'S NOT
 THIS.
 SO, IT WILL BE DIFFERENT.
 DO YOU THINK THAT WILL MAKE
 IT OKAY FOR OTHER PEOPLE DO
 THAT?
 I'VE BEEN GOING MANY YEARS.
 HE'S LIKE, OKAY, GOOD LUCK WITH
 THAT.
 SO, FOR HIM TO COME AROUND AND
 SEE THE BENEFITS AND LOOK
 FORWARD TO IT, IT WILL DO A LOT
 FOR THE STIGMA.
 YOU KNOW, MIND, BODY, AND SOUL
 WELLNESS.
 AND OTHER PEOPLE DO A LOT OF
 STUFF FOR YOU WHEN YOU'RE A
 PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE.
 WHAT WILL HE BE THE MOST A MESS
 ABOUT?
 I DON'T KNOW IF HE'LL CHANGE
 THAT A LOT.
 STOP THAT TALK.
 LISTEN.
 THANK GOD, THE MAN HAS
 INVESTED WELL.
 HE'S DONE QUITE WELL FOR
 HIMSELF.
 WE'RE MOVING, NOT MOVING, BUT
 WE'LL SPEND MORE TIME IN L.A.
 AND JUST A FEW THINGS THAT I'VE
 HAD IN MY MIND, TO MAKE AN
 ADJUSTMENT TO.
 LIKE WHAT?
 LIKE, NEW SHEETS EVERY DAY IN
 MY BED.
 CLEAN TOWELS EVERY DAY.
 WE'RE ON THE BLACK ACTRESS
 SALARY IN L.A., AND NOW THAT THE
 ME IN LOS ANGELES, WE'LL HAVE A
 ROMANTIC DIP IN THE POOL, HE'S
 LOOKING UNDERNEATH, AND HE WROTE
 A STRONGLY WORDED EMAIL TO THE

 GROUNDSKEEPER.
 AM I LYING?
 BECAUSE IT WAS MOLDY OR
 SOMETHING?
 THERE WERE LEAVES.
 IT'S OUTSIDE.
 LEAVES HAPPEN.
 IN ADDITION TO YOUR FUTURE
 LANDSCAPING CAREER, YOU'RE
 ALREADY A WINE MAKER, A SOCK,
 CLOTHES, AND SHOE MAGNATE.
 ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT GOING
 INTO BROADCASTING?
 I NEED HIM ON THE SET OF "THE
 JUMP."
 SE I LOVE YRGUMENT TO
 TRACY McGRADY.
 AND I NEED HELP, BECAUSE HE WINS
 EVERYTHING.
 YOU NEED TO COME HELP ME.
 CAN WE WORK THIS OUT?
 I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT IS
 THAT I WANT TO DO YET.
 BUT I KNOW I WANT TO DO A LITTLE
 BIT OF EVERYTHING.
 ESPECIALLY IN THE BEGINNING.
 I WANT TO SEE WHAT I CAN BE
 GREAT AT.
 I'M SO USED TO BEING GREAT AT
 SOMETHING, OR TRYING TO STRIVE
 TO BE GREAT AT SOMETHING.
 SO, WE'LL SEE.
 WHAT IS THE THING THAT YOU
 AND THE KIDS ARE THE MOST
 EXCITED HE'S GOING TO BE AROUND
 FOR NEXT?
 JUST THE REGULAR DUMB LITTLE
 THINGS.
 TRIPS TO THE VET.
 HE'S LIKE, I DON'T HAVE TO DO
 THAT.
 HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO THE
 VET?
 WE HAVE FIVE DOGS.
 HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO THE VET
 IN.
 NO.
 WE TALKED ABOUT YOUR CAREER,
 AND YOUR LEGACY IS SO MUCH MORE
 THAN POINTS AND ASSISTS.
 YOU, LeBRON, AND CHRIS CHANGED
 THE COURSE OF THE NBA, WITH THE
 WAY ■pERS HAGENCY.
 WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO YOU?
 IT MEANS A LOT, WHETHER TO
 THE GENERATION TO COME, THAT
 WILL NOT EVEN KNOW WHO I AM.
 BUT IT MEANS A LOT TO BE A PART
 OF HELPING PLAYERS UNDERSTAND
 THEIR POWER.
 AS WE'VE LEARNED OVER THE YEARS.
 AND I HOPE I'VE SET A GOOD
 ENOUGH EXAMPLE FOR WHO IS TO
 COME NEXT.
 TO UNDERSTAND THE POWER, TO
 UNDERSTAND THE VOICE, HOW TO USE
 THIS PLATFORM.
 I MADE A LOT OF MISTAKES BEFORE
 I GOT HERE, SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN
 HELP THE NEXT GENERATION.
 WHEN YOU PUT ON THE HOODIES
 FOR TRAYVON MARTIN, IT HAD BEEN
 DECADES SINCE SOMETHING LIKE
 THAT HAPPENED.
 WHEN I READ ARTICLES, SO AND
 SO LED THE WAY FOR FASHION, HE'S
 BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT.

 LIFETIME DEAL.
 YES, MY DADDY DID THAT.
 PEOPLE THOUGHT HE WAS CRAZY.

 SENSE OF SELF, KNOWING EXACTLY
 WHAT YOUR VALUE AND WORTH IS.
 AND BEING BULLHEADED.
