 THIS IS WHO HAS THE MOST -- A SMALLER DEAL.
 HE'S NOT -- WELL, WE HEARD
 ADRIAN TALK ABOUT IT.
 THERE'S NO INTEREST.
 WHEN THERE'S NO INTEREST GUESS
 WHAT KIND OF DEALS ARE AVAILABLE
 TO YOU, THE MINIMUM EXCEPTION.
 PUT ALL 30 TEAM THERE IS.
 VERY INTERESTING.
 WELL, WE HAVE TO SEE.
 WE MIGHT KNOW MORE BY TONIGHT.
 RIGHT?
 WE COULD KNOW ABOUT KAWHI AND
 BOOGIE BY TONIGHT.
 COME HANG OUT WITH US, 7:00 ON
 ESPN.
 WATCH YOUR PHONES BECAUSE IT'S
 FREE AGENCY.
 A LOT GOING ON.

 HOLIDAY WEEK.
 WENDI NIX, DIANNA RUSSINI,
 VICTOR CRUZ AND MIKE TANNENBAUM
 AND WE'LL START WITH NEWS
 REGARDING IZZY GILL ELLIOTT.
 THE DALLAS COWBOY RUNNING BACK
 EXPECTED TO MEET WITH THE
 COMMISSIONER TODAY IN NEW YORK
 CITY REGARDING A MAY INCIDENT IN
 LAS VEGAS.
 THE MEETING COMES AFTER AN
 INCIDENT AT A LAS VEGAS MUSIC
 FESTIVAL WHERE HE HAD A
 CONFRONTATION WITH A SECURITY
 GUARD BRIEFLY DETAINED BUT NEVER
 ARRESTED OR CHARGED IN THE
 INCIDENT.
 NEVERTHELESS, THE COMMISSIONER
 WANTS TO HEAR HIM OUT.
 DIANNA, WHAT MORE CAN YOU TELL
 US.
 AT THIS POINT WE DON'T KNOW
 EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING ON IN THAT
 MEETING BUT THEY ARE MEETING IN
 MANHATTAN TO DISCUSS ZEKE'S
 BEHAVIOR IN THAT LAS VEGAS
 INCIDENT.
 JERRY JONES, OF COURSE, HAS
 STOOD BY HIS RUNNING BACK SAYING
 THAT HE DOESN'T SEE ANYTHING
 WRONG WITH WHAT HE SAW ON
 VIDEOTAPE, AGAIN, ZEKE IN THOSE
 HANDCUFFS AND THEN THOSE
 HANDCUFFS WERE REMOVED.
 HE COULD STILL FACE PUNISHMENT
 IN GOODELL DECIDES HE VIOLATED
 THE LEAGUE'S PERSONAL CONDUCT
 POLICY AND THAT'S WHAT THIS MEET
 SOMETHING TO DISCUSS.
 BUT AS OF NOW WE ARE NOT SURE
 WHAT THE FUTURE HOLES BUT THOSE
 THAT I'VE SPOKEN TO WITH THE
 COWBOYS ORGANIZATION STRONGLY
 FEEL CONFIDENT THAT ZEKE WILL
 NOT FACE A SUSPENSION IN THIS
 BECAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT.
 MIKE, AS A GM, I KNOW YOU
 HAVE PLAYERS WHO HAD
 FACE-TO-FACE MEETINGS WITH THE
 COMMISSIONER WHO HAD HEARINGS OR
 DUE DILIGENCE.
 WHAT'S YOUR TAKE GENTLEMAN.
 DESPITE HOW THE COWBOYS ARE
 FEELING A SUSPENSION CERTAINLY
 IS IN PLAY.
 WE HAVE TO REMEMBER UNDER THE
 PERSONAL CONDUCT POLICY, A
 PLAYER CAN BE SUSPENDED EVEN
 THOUGH THERE MAY NOT BE CHRISMAN
 CHARGES AND THE FACT THAT
 EZEKIEL ELLIOTT IS MEETING IN
 PERSON WITH THE COMMISSIONER
 SIGNALS TO ME THAT A SUSPENSION
 ALBEIT ONE GAME, TWO GAMES COULD
 BE IN PLAY HERE AND HE WAS SENT
 TO NEW YORK FOR A REASON SO
 WE'LL SEE HOW IT PLAYS OUT IN
 THE COMING DAYS BUT HIS PRIOR
 BEHAVIOR WILL CERTAINLY BE A
 FACTOR IN THEIR ASSESSMENT.
 WELL, LET'S SHIFT GEARS TO
 BETWEEN THE LINES.
 VICTOR, HOW IMPORTANT IS THE RUN
 GAME TO THIS CURRENT DALLAS
 COWBOYS TEAM.
 HUGE, ESPECIALLY EZEKIEL
 ELLIOTT.
 HE'S BEEN THE FOCAL POINT OF THE
 OFFENSE YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT.
 HANDING HIM THE FOOTBALL BEHIND
 THAT FANTASTIC OFFENSIVE LINE, I
 MEAN, HE IS IN MY OPINION THE
 HEARTBEAT OF THAT OFFENSE.
 OBVIOUSLY DAK IS THE LEADER.
 BUT EZEKIEL MAKES HIM GO.
 YOU GOT THE PLAY-ACTION PASS AND
 EVERYTHING COMPLIMENTS THE
 ATTRIBUTES SO IF HE'S THERE TO
 MISS ANY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF
 TIME THE COWBOYS WOULD BE
 LOOKING TO REPLACE THAT, YOU
 KNOW, THOSE STATISTICS AND
 NUMBERS THAT HE PUTS UP WEEK IN
 AND WEEK OUT IN A DIFFERENT WAY.
 YEAH, AND, VIC, YOU HIT THE
 NAIL ON THE HEAD.
 WHEN YOU LOOK AT DAK PRESCOTT
 HIS PASS RATING CHANGED SO YOU
 CAN SEE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE
 RUNNING GAME, EZEKIEL ELLIOTT
 OBVIOUSLY OPPOSING DEFENSES ARE
 FOCUSING IN ON STOPPING EZEKIEL
 ELLIOTT AND THAT'S A VERY
 IMPACTFUL IN TERMS OF HIS IMPACT
 ON DAK PRESCOTT'S PRODUCTION A
 HUGE JUMP IN TERMS OF HIS PLAY
 ACTION PRODUCTIVITY.
 HUGE JUMP.

 WE'LL TALK ABOUT DAK'S DEAL AND
 WHEN IT MAY GET DONE.
 THIS DLABS TEAM STACKS UP IN THE
 DIVISION.
 I THINK THEY'RE RIGHT THERE
 AT THE TOP.
 I THINK THEY'RE COMPETING
 OBVIOUSLY THEM AND PHILADELPHIA
 RIGHT THERE NECK AND NECK GOING
 TO BE BATTLING IT OUT THROUGHOUT
 THE SEASON BUT I THINK THEY GOT
 ALL THE TOOLS.
 WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEM
 DEFENSIVELY FROM THE DEFENSIVE
 LINE BACK TO THE SECOND DRI
 THEY'RE LOADED AT EACH POSITION
 AND THEN OFFENSIVELY LIKE WE
 JUST TALKED ABOUT, DAK, EZEKIEL
 ELLIOTT, AMARI COOPER, RANDALL
 COBB, I COULD GO ON FOR DAYS
 WITH THIS BUT THEY HAVE ALL THE
 TALENT, EXACTLY.
 THEY GOT ALL OF THE TALENT NOT
 TO MENTION --
 NEW OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR.
 WHICH OBVIOUSLY COMES FROM,
 YOU KNOW, COLLEGE AND DOING
 THOSE DIFFERENT THINGS SO HE'LL
 PROVIDE SOME CREATIVITY THAT WE
 PROBABLY HAVEN'T SEEN FROM
 DIFFERENT TYPE OF PLAYS THAT WE
 HAVEN'T SEEN NECESSARILY FROM
 THE DALLAS COWBOYS.
 YOU'RE NOT GOING WITH THE
 EAGLES YOU'RE GOING WITH THE
 DALLAS COWBOYS TO WIN THAT
 DIVISION.
 YES, UNFORTUNATELY, NOBODY IN
 NEW YORK KILL ME.
 THAT WAS VICTOR.
 WHEN DOES DAK'S DEAL GET DONE?
 DO WE SEE THAT DONE BEFORE THE
 START OF THE SEASON?
 I THINK THAT WILL GET DONE
 BEFORE THE START OF THE SEASON.
 EVEN TALKING TO PEOPLE IN THE
 COWBOYS ORGANIZATION ABOUT THE
 TIMING OF IT, IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE
 JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO, THE WAY
 IT WAS BEING EXPLAINED TO ME IT
 WAS GOING TO BE A WHILE.
 IT WASN'T GOING TO GET DONE AND
 NOW IT SEEMS THAT I'M NOT SURE
 WHERE THE PRESSURE IS COMING
 FROM.
 I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY'RE FEELING
 THE PRESSURE BUT IN TERMS OF
 TRYING TO GET IT DONE IT SEEMS
 LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE A
 PRIORITY.
 THE PRESSURE COMES FROM WHAT
 DAK'S DRAFT DAY DISAPPOINTMENT
 WAS IS NOW BECOMING THE REALITY
 OF A FREE AGENT OPPORTUNITY
 BECAUSE HE WAS NOT A FIRST ROUND
 PICK WHICH WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT
 BUT HE'S IN THE FINAL YEAR OF
 HIT CONTRACT SO UNLIKE GUYS LIKE
 JARED GOFF AND CARSON WENTZ WHO
 HAD THE ADDITIONAL FIFTH YEAR HE
 COULD GET TO THE MARKET AND MAY
 NOT BE A PERFECT PLAYER.
 I'M A BELIEVE IN DAK PRESCOTT
 NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF WHAT HE CAN
 DO FROM A PASSING STANDPOINT BUT
 THE PLAYS HE MAKES WITH HIS
 LEGS, IF HE MADE IT TO THE OPEN
 MARKET THE WAY KIRK COUSINS DID
 A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO HARD TO
 SAY WHAT HE CAN GET.
 HE CAN CERTAINLY GET FRAN CHRIST
 BUT I CAN TELL YOU FROM AN
 ORGANIZATION STANDPOINT WHEN YOU
 USE THE FRANCHISE TAG THE LAST
 POSITION YOU WANT TO USE IT ON
 IS THE QUARTERBACK.
 BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE A
 FRANCHISE TAG, THAT MEANS THAT
 THE PLAYER DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
 THERE FOR THE OFF-SEASON
 PROGRAM.
 DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THERE FOR
 TRAINING CAMP.
 HE COULD COME IN THE TUESDAY
 BEFORE OPENING DAY, SIGN THE
 TAG, GET PAID FOR THE WHOLE
 SEASON AND IT REALLY PUTS THE
 OFFENSE AND ALL THOSE REPS YOU
 DON'T HAVE TOGETHER, VIC SO THE
 SENSE OF URGENCY IS COMING FROM
 THE FACT THAT THIS PLAYER IS 16
 GAMES AWAY FROM BECOMING A FREE
 AGENT.
 THAT QUARTERBACK ALSO FEELS
 THAT PRESSURE.
 I MEAN, THEY DON'T EVER REALLY
 FEEL LIKE THEY BELONG.
 WITH THE KIRK COUSINS SITUATION
 IN WASHINGTON.
 HE WAS ALWAYS OUT THERE PROVING
 AND PROVING AND PROVING.
 AND I REMEMBER TALKING TO HIM
 ABOUT IT AND YOU COULD TELL IT
 WAS --
 WEIGHS ON HIM.
 IT WAS LIKE THE WASHINGTON
 REDSKINS ORGANIZATION WERE
 LOOKING TO DATE AND DATE AND HE
 WAS LOOKING FOR A RING.
 HE WANTED TO GET MARRIED AND
 WANTED TO FEEL THAT LOVE AND
 NEVER DID.
 FOR THE COWBOYS TO PUT THAT ON
 DAK THAT MAY NOT WORK OUT FOR
 THEM, YOU KNOW, IF THEY WANT TO
 MAKE THAT WORK.
 YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S MARRIED TO,
 MONEY.
 A LOT OF MONEY.
 I AM NOT CRYING FOR KIRK COUSINS
 BUT IT IS A POINT WELL MADE.
 ALL RIGHT.
 ANYWAY, CIRCLING BACK TO WHERE
 WE STARTED ZEKE ELLIOTT AND THE
 COWBOYS HOPING HE WILL NOT MISS
 ANY TIME.

 FORMER PACKERS WIDE RECEIVER
 RANDALL COBB SIGNED BY THE
 COWBOYS IN FREE AGENCY TEAMED UP
 WITH AARON RODGERS FOR OVER
 5,000 RECEIVING YARDS AFTER
 BEING DRAFTED BY THE PACK IN

 HE WILL FACE HIS FORMER TEAM
 WEEK FIVE IN DALLAS AND HE HAD
 TO SAY THIS ABOUT MOVING ON FROM
 GREEN BAY.
 IT'S LIKE THE EX-GIRLFRIEND THAT
 BREAK UP WITH YOU.
 WHEN YOU SEE HER FIVE YEARS
 LATER YOU HOPE YOU'RE IN A
 BETTER SITUATION THAN YOU WERE
 BEFORE.
 MARRIED WITH KIDS AND ABLE TO
 SAY, YEAH, I DID BETTER WITHOUT
 YOU.
 YOU KNOW WHAT, HE'S RIGHT.
 NOBODY SAYS THAT BUT THAT'S HOW
 EVERYBODY FEELS.
 NOT EVERY BREAKUP HAS TO BE
 CONTENTIOUS.
 I DON'T CARE IF IT'S THE BEST
 BREAKUP EVER.
 LIFE WASN'T SO GREAT --
 YOU'RE WINNING, I'M NOT.
 YOU WANT TO WIN.
 IT IS WHAT IT IS.
 ANYWAY, THAT GOT US THINKING
 FIVE YEARS FROM NOW WHO IS
 BETTER OFF?
 WE SAW A NUMBER OF NFL BREAKUPS,
 IF YOU WILL SO FIVE-YEAR MARK.
 RANDALL COBB OR THE GREEN BAY
 PACKERS WHOCHLT IS BETTER OFF.
 I'M GOING WITH RANDALL.
 HE'S JOINING A TEAM IN THE
 COWBOYS THAT'S A YOUNGER TEAM.
 I THINK THEY'RE AN OVERALL
 BETTER TEAM RIGHT NOW THAN THE
 GREEN BAY PACKERS BUT I THINK IN
 FIVE YEARS HE'LL BE IN THE
 PLAYOFFS A COUPLE OF TIMES.
 HE'LL -- HE'S OBVIOUS IN THE MIX
 THAT HAVE WIDE RECEIVING CORE
 AND THAT SLOT POSITION IS
 IMPORTANT IN THE NFL NOWADAYS
 AND I THINK OVERALL HE'LL JUST
 BE BETTER.
 DAK PRESCOTT HAS A BETTER
 QUARTERBACK.
 THAT WILL SERVE HIM BETTER GIVEN
 THAT LONGEVITY AND BE THERE FOR
 A COUPLE YEARS AND BUILD THAT
 CAMARADERIE WITH DAK THAT WILL
 SERVE HIM.
 HE WON'T MISS AARON RODGERS
 AT ALL.
 THEY'RE A BETTER OVERALL
 TEAM.
 FIVE YEARS.

 A LOT CAN HAPPEN.
 ALL RIGHT.
 LISTEN, THERE WERE NO -- IN
 MY OPINION NO MORE NOTABLE
 BREAKUP THAN THAT ONE BETWEEN
 ODELL BECKHAM JR. AND THE NEW
 YORK GIANTS.
 THIS IS EASY IF YOU'RE TALKING
 ABOUT NOW.
 BUT FIVE YEARS.
 ODELL BECKHAM JR. IS GOING TO
 BE IN A MUCH BETTER POSITION.
 HE GOT PAID, TONS OF MONEY AND
 HAS OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE MORE
 MONEY.
 PRICE OF LIVING IN CLEVELAND IS
 LOWER.
 TAKKS ARE LOWER.
 SO FROM A PERSONAL FINANCIAL
 STANDPOINT ODELL BECKHAM JR. IS
 WINNING BIG TIME BUT WHEN IT
 COMES TO FOOTBALL, THERE IS NO
 QUARTERBACK THAT I BELIEVE HAS
 MORE POTENTIAL TO BE ONE OF THE
 GREATEST THAN I BELIEVE IN WHAT
 BAKER MAYFIELD COULD DO IN TERMS
 OF THE CONTINUITY AND THE TEAM
 THEY'RE BUILDING COMPARED TO NEW
 YORK.
 WE'RE NOT SURE WHAT WILL HAPPEN
 TO HAT SHURMUR IF HE WILL BE
 THERE.
 HE COULD BE ON THE HOT SEAT IF
 IT DOESN'T WORK.
 IT SEEMS CLEVELAND IS A MUCH
 BETTER OFF PLACE FOR ODELL
 BECKHAM JR. SO I THINK HE'S
 GOING TO LOOK BACK AND GO, YOU
 KNOW WHAT, THAT'S GOOD.
 WHAT IS INTERESTING THE
 GIANTS HAD A COUPLE OF BREAKUPS.
 LANDON COLLINS, BETTER OFF IN
 FIVE YEARS.
 I'LL GO THE OTHER WAY.
 THE NEW YORK GIANTS AND DAVE
 GETTLEMAN.
 WHAT WE LOOK AT WHAT DMEF'S DONE
 TO REHIM THEY ACQUIRED BETHEA
 AND PEPPERS THAT SENT ODELL
 BECKHAM TO CLEVELAND AND
 ALTHOUGH COLLINS IS A GOOD
 PLAYER I THOUGHT HE WAS MORE
 PRODUCTIVE CLOSER TO THE LINE OF
 SCRIMMAGE.
 WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WAY PEPPERS
 PLAYS HE CAN REPLACE HIM.
 SO IT'S NOT FIVE YEARS, WE KNOW
 WE'RE BETTER OFF WITHOUT LANDON.
 WOW.
 ALL RIGHT.
 FAIR ENOUGH.
 NOTED.
 YOU KNOW, SAID THERE WAS NO
 BIGGER BREAKUP THEN I THOUGHT
 ABOUT A.B. AND THE STEELERS.
 I WANT TO RETRACT THAT.
 ANTONIO BROWN AND THE STEELERS.
 THIS ONE I THINK IS TRICKY AGAIN
 TALKING ABOUT FIVE SEASONS OUT.
 WHO IS BETTER OFF.
 I'M GOING WITH THE STEELERS.
 I REALLY FEEL LIKE THE STEELERS
 ORGANIZATION AS A WHOLE WILL BE
 FULLY TURN THE PAGE FULLY FROM
 ANTONIO BROWN DRAMA AND BE
 LOOKING TO JUJU.
 HE'LL BE TENURED, A TRUE VETERAN
 LEADER ON THAT TEAM.
 UNDERSTAND WHO HE IS.
 BIG BEN, WHO KNOWS HOW MANY
 YEARS HE HAS LEFT BUT WITH THAT
 BODY FRAME HE CAN STILL BE THERE
 FIVE YEARS FROM NOW PLAYING AT A
 HIGH LEVEL BUT THESE GUYS ARE
 READY TO PLAY AS A TEAM AS A
 PERSPECTIVE ONCE THEY GET RID OF
 THE DRAMA AND NEGATIVITY
 SURROUND THE TEAM WITH Le'VEON
 BELL AND ALL OF THESE THINGS, I
 THINK FIVE YEARS FROM NOW THIS
 TEAM WILL BE BETTER.
 BEN ROETHLISBERGER WILL BE
 RELAXED AND THE TEAM WILL BE
 GOOD TO GO.
 PERFECT SEGUE.
 HOW ABOUT Le'VEON BELL AND THE
 PITTSBURGH STEELERS.
 I THINK WE SAW A LITTLE BIT
 OF A PREVIEW LAST YEAR, RIGHT?
 BELL WAS A STEELER BUT HE REALLY
 WASN'T.
 WASN'T.
 SO WE'LL GO WITH THE
 PITTSBURGH STEELERS AND TALKING
 ABOUT JAMES CONNER WHO FILLED IN
 LAST YEAR FOR Le'VEON BELL.
 WE HAVE ANOTHER YEAR WITH HIM
 NOW IN THE OFF-SEASON PROGRAM
 AND I THINK REALLY WHERE WE'RE
 GOING TO MISS BELL, GUYS, IS AS
 A RUSHER BUT A RECEIVER BUT
 JAMES CON CERRA A REALLY GOOD
 RUNNING BACK.
 PRODUCTIVE BETWEEN TACKLES AND
 GOOD PASS PROTECTOR AND ANOTHER
 YEAR OF GOING INTO THE JOB, I
 THINK PITTSBURGH YEAR IN AND
 YEAR OUT DOES A GREAT JOB OF
 LETTING GUYS MOVE ON AND
 REPLACING BELL AND AGREE WITH
 VICTOR AND THINK THEY'LL REPLACE
 A.B. AND REPLACE BELL VERY WELL
 WITH JAMES CONNER.
 ALL RIGHT, I DO THINK THAT
 TEAM HAS SORT OF RALLIED AROUND
 THE DEPARTURES.
 THAT'S NOW.
 WE'LL SEE WHERE THEY ARE IN A
 FEW SEASONS.
 THIS LAST ONE, I'M NOT SURE THEY
 DATED.
 I DON'T KNOW.
 THEY WENT OUT.
 IT WAS A HOOKUP.

 THE CARDINALS AND --
 I THINK JOSH ROSEN WILL BE
 BETTER OFF.
 HE HAD THE WEIGHT OF THE WORLD
 ON HIS SHOULDERS.
 HE WAS A TOP DRAFT PICK.
 THE ANSWER TO THE ARIZONA
 CARDINALS ORGANIZATION.
 OF COURSE THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT
 SO HERE HE IS IN MIAMI NOW, THE
 PRESSURE IS REALLY OFF.
 HE'S GOT A NEW HEAD COACH HERE.
 THEY'RE GOING TO BE RUNNING A
 NEW ENGLAND SYSTEM.
 BY THE WAY IF YOU RUN THE NEW
 ENGLAND OFFENSIVE SYSTEM YOU GOT
 TO BE A SMART GUY.
 THAT'S WHAT JOSH ROSEN IS.
 ELSE'S A SMART GUY AND I THINK
 HE'S GOING TO FIT IN WELL THERE
 AND IS GOING TO BE A PLACE --
 OH, BY THE WAY HE HAS
 FITZPATRICK BEHIND HIM THAT
 DOESN'T HAVE THE ATTITUDE OF A
 START THEIR DOESN'T WANT TO
 HELP.
 TWO SMART GUYS IN THE
 QUARTERBACK ROOM, A MUCH BETTER
 PLACE FOR JOSH.
 DIANNA, WHAT ABOUT KYLER
 MURRAY?
 YOU DON'T THINK THEY HAVE A
 CHANCE TO BE A DYNAMIC
 PLAYMAKER --
 THAT'S WHAT THE QUESTION IS.
 AN ASSESSMENT OF KYLER MURRAY IN
 A LOT OF WAYS.
 THE BIG QUESTION MARK WILL IT
 WORK?
 TO ME MY BIGGEST ISSUE WITH
 ARIZONA IS LAST YEAR AND THIS
 YEAR IS THEIR OFFENSIVE LINE SO
 AS MUCH AS WE CAN SAY KYLER
 MURRAY.
 I GOT FIVE YEARS --
 THAT'S RIGHT.
 LOOKING FOR A GM.
 NO.
 TRYING TO GET RID OF ME?
 I GOT FIVE YEAR.
 BREAKING UP IS HARD TO DO.
 YOU GAVE ME FIVE YEARS.
 I DID.
 FAIR ENOUGH.
 ALL RIGHT.
 WHEN WE COME BACK, JUJU
 SMITH-SCHUSTER ISN'T THINKING
 FIVE YEARS.
 HE'S THINKING RIGHT NOW AND
 WE'LL TALK ROLE MODELS AND
 STEELERS CULTURE COMING UP.
 HI, I'M JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER

 IS THIS WHERE THE IMMACULATE
 FOOTBALL WAS?
 NO, NO, NO.
 WHENEVER I SAY WE'RE GOING TO
 WIN THE GAME I GUARANTEE IT.
 I MEANT IT.
 STARTED THE NFL.
 WHOA.
 QUIT LOOKING AT MY CHEST
 HAIR.
 LOOK AT THE PLAY.
 GET THOSE LEGS UP.
 THAT IS JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER.
 SMITH-SCHUSTER PAST MIDFIELD.
 EXTRA POINT.
 BY THE MAN CALLED JUJU.
 JUJU, JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER IN THE
 BACK OF THE END ZONE.
 WOW.
 WE'RE JOINED THIS AFTERNOON
 BY JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER WHO IS
 MAKING HIS WAY ALL THE WAY
 ACROSS THE ATLANTIC.
 HE IS IN LONDON THIS AFTERNOON
 FOR THE NFL ACADEMY WHERE HE'S
 AN AMBASSADOR.
 JUJU, TELL US EXACTLY WHAT THAT
 IS AND WHAT IT MEANS THERE IN
 LONDON.
 SO, HERE IN LONDON WE'RE
 WORKING WITH THE NFL ACADEMY
 WHICH IS AN AMAZING THING.
 THEY GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO
 PLAYERS, YOUNG PLAYERS FROM THE
 AGE OF 15 AND UP, YOU KNOW, WHO
 LEARN THE NEW GAME, AMERICAN
 FOOTBALL.
 THIS IS NEW TO THEM WHICH IS
 AWESOME BUT IT'S AWESOME BECAUSE
 IT JUST GIVES THEM THE
 OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE ANOTHER
 CAREER, ANOTHER WAY TO PLAY IN
 THE STATES IN THE NFL.
 WE TALKED TO JAMES CONNER
 YESTERDAY.
 HE TALKED ABOUT TURNING THE
 PAGE.
 ABOUT THE CHANGES THAT HAD GONE
 ON IN PITTSBURGH DURING THE
 OFF-SEASON.
 WHAT IS THE TEMPERATURE OF THIS
 TEAM AS YOU GET READY FOR
 TRAINING CAMP?
 WE'RE NOT TOO COLD.
 WE'RE NOT TOO HOT.
 THE WEATHER IS NICE.
 EVERYONE IS ON THE SAME PAGE.
 FOCUS ON THE SAME GOAL WHICH IS
 AMAZING BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT
 WE'RE ALL ABOUT.
 ABOUT THE TEAM.
 THERE'S NO INDIVIDUALS AND HERE
 TO WIN GAMES.
 JUJU, TALK TO ME ABOUT SOME
 OF THE TALENT YOU'RE SEEING IN
 LONDON.
 ANY BALLERS OUT THERE?
 ANY FUTURE STEELERS OUT THIS OR
 WHAT?
 MAN, THERE'S SOME TALENT
 HERE.
 THERE'S SOME POTENTIAL.
 I MEAN YOU GOT TO UNDERSTAND
 THIS GAME IS NEW TO THEM.
 WE STARTED LIFTING WEIGHTS AT

 THEY'RE BARELY STARTING AT 16,

 IF WE'RE TO GET THEM ON THE
 RIGHT PAGE IT WOULD BE AMAZING
 TO START A POP CARNER AND START
 IN MIDDLE SCHOOL, HIGH SCHOOL
 AND THAT WOULD BE THEIR ACADEMY.
 ALL RIGHT, JUJU, IT'S BEEN
 WELL DOCUMENTED THAT ANTONIO
 BROWN IS NO LONGER WITH THE
 STEELERS.
 NOW YOU'RE THE NUMBER ONE GUY.
 HOW DOES IT FEEL?
 DO YOU FEEL A DIFFERENCE IN THE
 LOCKER ROOM?
 ARE PEOPLE TREATING YOU
 DIFFERENTLY?
 ARE DUDES GETTING YOUR TRAYS OF
 LUNCH FOR YOU?
 IS IT A DIFFERENT FEELING BEING
 THE NUMBER ONE GUY?
 HOW DOES IT FEEL?
 NO, MAN, IT FEELS NO
 DIFFERENT.
 I MEAN ALWAYS PEOPLE SAY, OH,
 YOU'RE THE NUMBER ONE GUY THIS
 YEAR BUT MORE FOR MYSELF I GIVE
 MYSELF MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR
 OTHERS GUY TO STEP UP.
 TALK ABOUT A.B. HAVING A HUNDRED
 CATCHES OVER A THOUSAND YARDS.
 THOSE WILL BE SPREAD OUT BETWEEN
 JAMES CONNER, JAMES WASHINGTON,
 DONTE MONCRIEF, JAMES SAMUELS.
 SO MANY GUYS WILL GET MORE
 TOUCHES, MORE CATCHES, MORE YAC.
 I'M THE STILL SAME GUY IN THE
 LOCKER ROOM.
 THE 22-YEAR-OLD VERSION OF
 JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER AND, JUJU,
 YOU REFERENCED THE FOOTBALL
 BEING SPREAD AROUND.
 THAT MAKES THE COMMUNICATION
 WITH BEN ROETHLISBERGER ALL THAT
 MORE IMPORTANT.
 WHAT IS YOUR RELATIONSHIP LIKE
 WITH YOUR QUARTERBACK?
 IT'S AMAZING, MAN.
 BEN, HE'S A GREAT LEADER.
 GREAT DUDE.
 HE TOOK THE WHOLE OFFENSIVE
 GROUP DOWN TO HIS HOUSE IN
 GEORGIA.
 AMAZING, YOU KNOW, WE SPEND TIME
 TOGETHER.
 BONDING, WORKED HARD.
 THREW.
 AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S LIKE
 DURING THAT BONDING THAT
 CONNECTION AND WHAT HE DID FOR
 US WAS AMAZING.
 I THINK IT'S SO CRAZY THAT A GUY
 WHO HAS BEEN IN THE LEAGUE FOR
 15, 16 YEARS SEES SO MANY GUYS
 COME AND GO AND, YOU KNOW, FOR
 ME I'M ONLY 22 YEARS OLD.
 I MET HIM I WAS 20 YEARS OLD AND
 OUR BOND IS JUST -- WE'RE JUST
 GOING TO KEEP GROWING.
 AS AN ATHLETE, AS THE
 SUPERSTAR ATHLETE YOU ARE,
 YOU'RE ALWAYS WORKING ON
 SOMETHING NEW.
 GIVE ME ONE THING YOU'VE BEEN
 WORKING ON TO EITHER GET BETTER
 AT OR SOMETHING YOU WANT TO ADD
 TO YOUR GAME OR WHATEVER THE
 CASE MAY BE?
 MAN, I WANT TO REALLY, REALLY
 FOCUS AND PLAY MORE INSIDE AND
 OUTSIDE LEARNING THE WHOLE
 PACKAGE, LEARNING THE WHOLE
 OFFENSE.
 THAT'S WHAT SPATES BEING ON THE
 FIELD THE WHOLE GAME AND BEING
 ON THE FIELD CERTAIN PLAY,
 CERTAIN PACKAGES.
 I THINK IT'S GREAT I'M ABLE TO
 PLAY OUTSIDE, INSIDE, RIGHT
 SIDE, LEFT SIDE.
 YOU KNOW, MOVEMENT AND IT'S THE
 SAME, THAT WILL HELP OUT A LOT
 AND THAT'S SOMETHING I'VE BEEN
 FOCUSED ON STUDYING THAT
 PLAYBOOK AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT
 EVERYBODY HAS TO DO.
 JUJU, WE ALSO GET TO SEE
 EVERYTHING ELSE YOU DO VIA
 SOCIAL MEDIA.
 DOES ANYBODY IN THE NFL HAVE
 MORE FUN THAN YOU DO?
 NOT NECESSARILY.
 I MEAN I DO A LOT OF STUFF ON
 YOUTUBE SO A LOT OF STUFF I DO
 ON THAT END.
 I REALLY LOVE TO SHOW MY
 PERSONAL SIDE ON MY FUN SIDE
 WHAT I DO IN MY FREE TIME
 PLAYING AND MAKING YOUTUBE
 VIDEOS.
 I THINK A LOT OF GUYS IN THE NFL
 JUST POST A LOT OF WORKING OUT
 WHICH IS NOTHING WRONG WITH
 THAT, YOU KNOW, BUT WHAT DO THEY
 LIKE TO DO IN THEIR FREE TIME?
 DO THEY LIKE TO TRAVEL THE
 WORLD, STAY HOME AND WATCH
 MOVIES.
 I THINK A LOT OF THEIR FANS
 WOULD LIKE THAT.
 SOME LIKE TO GO TO PROM WHICH
 APPARENTLY YOU DID RECENTLY.
 TELL US ABOUT THE PROM.
 SO THE PROM WAS AWESOME.
 YOU KNOW, A KID, HE'S FROM P.A.,
 PITTSBURGH.
 IDEALLY HE WANTED TO TAKE THIS
 GIRL THAT HE LIKED A LOT AND HIS
 BEST FRIEND ENDS UP TAKING HER.
 HE TOLD HIS BEST FRIEND BUT HIS
 BEST FRIEND WENT BEHIND HIS GIRL
 AND TOOK THIS GIRL SO HE ASKED
 ME, MAN, LET'S ONE-UP BUY A
 SUIT, GET A PARTY BUS.
 WE BASICALLY STOLE THE NIGHT
 AWAY FOR HIM AND AT THE END OF
 THE DAY I MET THE GUY.
 HE SEEMS LIKE A GOOD KID SO HE'S
 GREAT.
 MY FRIEND IS GREAT BECAUSE HE
 GOT LIKE 20K FOLLOWERS, ANTHONY
 SO HE'S SUPER EXCITED ABOUT HIS
 COLLEGE CAREER COMING SOON.
 ANTHONY ONE FRIEND AND
 GIRLFRIEND NOTHING.
 HE WINS.
 JUJU, WE SAW YOU GETTING BUSY
 ON THE DANCE FLOOR RIGHT THERE.
 TALK TO ME ABOUT WHAT
 CELEBRATIONS YOU GOT IN STORE.
 I KNOW YOU'RE ALWAYS CREATIVE
 AND BRING NEW STUFF TO THE
 TABLE.
 WHAT YOU GOT IN STORE FOR US
 THIS YEAR FROM THE CELEBRATION
 STANDPOINT?
 MAN, DON'T LOOK.
 I'M SO EXCITED.
 YES, I'M THE YOUNG DUDE IN THE
 ROOM BUT I'M VOCAL.
 IT'S MY TIME TO STEP UP AND BE A
 LEADER AND GETTING EVERYBODY ON
 THE PAGE TO DO A CELEBRATION.
 DONTE MONCRIEF IS OLDER BUT ALL
 THESE GUYS, MY RECEIVERS, JAMES
 WASHINGTON IS ON THE SAME PAGE
 BECAUSE WE'RE IN THE SAME CLASS
 AND THEN I'M STILL WORKING ON
 BIG BEN, YOU KNOW AND THE
 O-LINEMEN.
 THEY ARE A LOT OLDER SO THEY'RE
 VETS.
 BEEN HERE BEFORE.
 WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
 MAJOR CELEBRATION COMING SOON.
 WE CAN'T WAIT.
 LAST QUESTION WE ASKED JAMES
 CONNER THIS YESTERDAY TO CLOSE
 THINGS OUT.
 WHY SHOULD STEELER FANS BE
 OPTIMISTIC AS WE LOOK TOWARDS

 MAN, YOU KNOW, STEELER FANS
 ARE ALWAYS SUPPORTING US SINCE
 DAY ONE WHETHER WE DO BAD OR
 GOOD.
 I DON'T DOUBT THEY'LL SUPPORT US
 TO THE END.
 I'M KIND OF HAPPY LIKE WHERE
 WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT
 LIKE THE HEADLINE, THE BROWNS,
 THEY'RE THE TEAM THAT EVERYONE
 IS WATCHING WHAT KIND OF NOISE
 THEY'LL MAKE.
 I'M SUPER EXCITED TO WATCH THEM
 PLAY TOO.
 SEEING OBJ COMMENTING ON MY POST
 AND I'M COMMENTING ON HIS POST.
 CAN'T WAIT.
 THE FANS WILL SUPPORT UNTIL THE
 END BECAUSE WE'LL FINISH STRONG
 AND ALWAYS FOE THAT.
 BEST OFLUCK.
 WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING WITH US.
 THANKS FOR BEING WITH US, JU.
 THANK YOU.
 I APPRECIATE IT.
 WITH ANTONIO BROWN NOW
 DEPARTED TO OAKLAND, JUJU WILL
 BECOME BIG BEN'S NUMBER ONE MAN
 AND HE SHOULD RECEIVE TIGHTER
 COVERAGE.
 OVER THE LAST TWO SEASONS WHEN
 FACING PRESS COVERAGE JUJU
 ACTUALLY HAD A BETTER PASS RATE
 AND YARDS PER TARGET THAN
 ANTONIO BROWN.

 CLEARLY, VICTOR, PERSPECTIVE
 CHANGES A LITTLE BIT, I WILL
 THINK.
 HE'S THE NUMBER ONE GUY.
 HE CAN SAY WHATEVER.
 YOU KNOW, WHAT KIND OF PRESSURE?
 HOW IS IT DIFFERENT FOR JUJU
 STARTING THIS SEASON TAN SAY
 LAST YEAR.
 THE ONLY THING DIFFERENT IS
 THE MIND-SET, PERSPECTIVE.
 COMING INTO THAT LOCKER ROOM AND
 ANTONIO BROWN IS NOT THERE.
 JUST YOU AND NOW YOU BECOME KIND
 OF THAT LEADER.
 PEOPLE ARE LOOKING TO YOU.
 YOU'VE BEEN THERE.
 YOU UNDERSTAND WHO YOU ARE.
 22 YEARS OLD BUT NOW YOU BECOME
 THE GUY THAT THE YOUNGER PEOPLE,
 THE YOUNGER TEAMMATES ARE
 LOOKING UP TO YOU WANTING TO
 KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND WANT
 TOCK HANG OUT WITH YOU IN THE
 OFF-SEASON AND STEAL A LITTLE
 KNOWLEDGE FROM YOU AND YOUR
 RELATIONSHIP WITH BEN AND GET A
 HEAD START ON WHAT THEY NEED TO
 DO TO GET BETTER AND HE LEADS
 THE CHARGE IN THAT RARD AND
 IT'S PRETTY BIG SHOES TO FILL.
 I THINK THE STEELERS HAVE
 DONE A GREAT JOB AND WERE
 PREPARING FOR THIS FOR A NUMBER
 OF YEARS AND THERE WAS THAT
 WHOLE NOTION OF WE HAVE TO BIN
 FOR TODAY AND DEVELOP FOR
 TOMORROW.
 AND YOU LOOK AT THAT POSITION
 AND THAT ORGANIZATION GOING BACK
 TO MIKE WALLACE, SANTONIO
 HOLMES, OBVIOUSLY ANTONIO BROWN,
 SMITH-SCHUSTER, DO A GREAT JOB
 OF GETTING GUYS IN THE PIPELINE
 AND DEVELOPED AND NOW ANTONIO
 BROWN MOVES ON, SMITH-SCHUSTER
 STEPS UP AND HAVE DONE A
 REMARKLY GREAT JOB FOR A NUMBER
 OF YEARS AT THIS POSITION.
 I THINK THAT'S A GAIT POINT
 AND WOULD ARGUE OUTSIDE OF NEW
 ENGLAND THEY POSSIBLY DO IT AS
 WELL AS ANYBODY IN TERMS OF
 CONTINUITY AND NOW ANTONIO BROWN
 ENDED IN A WAY THEY PROBABLY
 DIDN'T ANTICIPATE BUT DID
 ANTICIPATE IT WOULD END AT SOME
 POINT AND TO YOUR POINT THEY
 SEEM TO BE SORT OF IN LOCKSTEP
 WITH PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE.
 I THINK THERE'S THREE THINGS
 THAT JUJU JOOUMG HAS TO PROBABLY
 FOCUS ON THIS SEASON.
 IT'S GOING FROM BEING A GREAT
 RECEIVER TO AN ELITE RECEIVER.
 HE NEEDS TO PLAY AT THAT LEVEL.
 VICTOR TOUCHED ON THE LEADERSHIP
 ASPECT.
 OBVIOUSLY JUST FROM THAT
 INTERVIEW YOU CAN HEAR HE HAS
 STEPPED UP TO BE THE LEAD EVER
 TALKING ABOUT TRYING TO GET BIG
 BEN AND THE OFFENSIVE LINE TO
 PARTICIPATE IN HIS CELEBRATION
 DRILLS AND THEY OBVIOUSLY HAVE
 GOOD CHEMISTRY THERE AND THEN
 THAT THIRD LAYER IS BEING A
 MENTOR TO THOSE YOUNGER GUYS SO
 HE'S GOING TO BE ASKED A LOT
 MORE OF HIM AS A FOOTBALL PLAYER
 OUT ON THE FIELD AND OF COURSE
 IN THE LOCKER ROOM BUT IF
 THERE'S ONE THING I THINK WE'VE
 LEARNED ABOUT JUJU OVER THE
 YEARS IS HE ATTACKS EVERYTHING
 WITH OPEN ARMS.
 HE IS AN OPEN BOOK HIMSELF.
 HE EMBRACES THAT ROLE AND HE
 WANTS TO BE THAT CHARACTER GUY.
 HE WANTS TO BE THAT GOOD GUY AND
 WHEN HE TAOS TO PLAYERS ON THE
 STEELERS ABOUT JUJU SMITH AND
 WHAT HIS PERSONALITY IS LIKE
 OBVIOUSLY ON SOCIAL MEDIA HE'S
 SO MUCH FUN, APPARENTLY HE DOES
 A LOT OF HIS WORK SILENTLY.
 HE'S NOT THE LOUDEST GUY I THE
 ROOM.
 NOT THE ONE JOKING AROUND DURING
 DRILLS.
 HE LIKES TO HAVE FUN BUT HE IS
 LOCKED IN AND FOCUSED AND I
 THINK IF HE CAN TAKE HIT GAME TO
 THAT'S LET LEVEL THE ANTONIO
 BROWN CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'RE
 GOING TO BE HAVING WILL FEEL SO
 LONG AGO.
 HE SAID THAT WAS REALLY
 IMPRESSIVE IN THE INTERVIEW AND
 TOUCHED ON THE END ABOUT THE
 STEELERS ARE ALWAYS THERE IN THE
 EN.
 IT'S NOT WHERE YOU START.
 IT'S WHERE YOU END AND YOU LOOK
 AT PITTSBURGH AND NEW ENGLAND.
 THOSE TEAM ALWAYS IMPROVE DURING
 THE COURSE OF THE SEASON SO
 JAMES CONNER, SMITH-SCHUSTER IN
 A NEW ROLE.
 NOT WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE IN
 AUGUST OR SEPTEMBER.
 ARE THEY ASCENDING AND GETTING
 BETTER AND MIKE TOMLIN DESERVES
 SO MUCH CREDIT.
 PLAYDEVELOPMENT.
 THE WAY THEY COACH THEIR PLAYERS
 GET BETTER AND I THOUGHT HIS
 POINT WAS A GOOD ONE WHICH IS,
 HEY, WE'LL BE THERE IN THE END
 BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THEY'VE
 BEEN YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT.
 SEEMS LIKE THEY TRANSFORM AND
 MORPH INTO WHATEVER THEY NEED TO
 BE TO WIN TOWARD THE SECOND HALF
 OF 9 SEASON AND KEEPS THEM IN
 THE HUNT.
 FROM ALL KIND OF REASONS WHY
 EVERYBODY IS LOOKING TO
 CLEVELAND BUT I THINK YOU'D BE
 UNWISE TO SLEEP ON PITTSBURGH IN
 ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM.
 MIKE TOMLIN, A VETERAN SQUAD, A
 GOOD TEAM.
 I THINK YOU COULD ARGUE
 UNDERACHIEVED LAST SEASON.
 WE'LL SEE.
 WHAT DO PATRICK MAHOMES, SAQUON
 BARKLEY AND KYLER MURRAY HAVE IN
 COMMON?
 THEY TURN HEADS.
 WE'LL CROWN THE HIGHLIGHT KING
 NEXT.
 YOU EVER WATCH HIGHLIGHTS FROM YOUTUBE?
 PATRICK MAHOMES ON FIRE.
 ONE WAY, ZINGS IT ANOTHER.
 GIANTS OVER THE TOP.
 TOUCHDOWNS KYLER MURRAY.
 AN ABSOLUTE DIME.
 HE'S THE BEST QUARTERBACK
 YOU'LL EVER SEE AT EVERYTHING
 ELXCEPT HEIGHT.
 PATRICK MAHOMES WITH MAHOMES
 MAGIC.
 HOW DID HE PULL THAT OFF?

 I've been waiting my whole life            for this.

            You ready?
             Are you?

               Woo.

  The ant mindlessly marches on.
   Carrying up to 50 times it's   body weight.
        It never questions        the tasks at hand.
  But this year, there's a more  thrilling path to follow.

 SPECIFICALLY ON THIS PENDING
 LEAGUE DEAL.
 DAN GRAZIANO REPORTING THERE IS
 HOPE OF GETTING A NEW CBA BY THE
 START OF THE 2019 SEASON.
 GREAT.
 LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT A FEW
 NFL PLAYERS NOMINATED FOR THE
 ESPYS.
 AFTER AN IMPRESSIVE SOPHOMORE
 SEASON THROWING OVER 5,000 YARDS
 AND WON AN MVP JUST THAT,
 PATRICMAHOMES NOMINATED FOR
 BEST MALE ATHLETE.
 SAQUON BARKLEY NOMINATE THE FOR
 THE BEST BREAKTHROUGH ATHLETE
 LAST SEASON, BARKLEY RUSHED FOR
 1307 YARDS.
 BROKE A GIANTS ROOKIE RECORD.
 KYLER MURRAY BECAME THE SEVENTH
 PLAYER TO WIN THE HEISMAN IN
 OU'S HISTORY.
 NONE OF THE E TOO SHABBY.
 TODAY WE GIVE OUT THE HIGHLIGHT
 KING AWARD.
 AN ESPY.
 IT IS NOT?
 IT SHOULD BE.
 FUNNY, MY CHOICE HERE IS
 KANSAS CITY QUARTERBACK PATRICK
 MAHOMES.
 HE IS UP FOR MALE ATHLETE OF THE
 YEAR.
 GETS MY VOTE.
 HEARD WHY.
 AGAINST THE RAVENS FACING FOURTH
 AND NINE FROM THE TEAM'S 40.
 MAHOMES IS HIT.
 WE HAVE SEEN HIM DO COUNTLESS
 TIMES WHICH WAS BUY TIME WITH
 HIS FEET.
 GET OUT OF BOUNDS RELIES ON HIS
 RIGHT HAND.
 FINES TYREEK HILL DOWNFIELD AND
 AFTER THE PART ANDY REID SAID
 THAT'S HOW WE DESIGN I HAD IT.
 OH, SURE, ANDY.
 AGAINST THE BRONCOS.
 WE KNEW HIS RIGHT HAND WAS
 MAGICAL.
 DID YOU JUST SAY LUCKY.
 WE NEW HIS RIGHT HAND WAS
 MAGICAL.
 HIS LEFT HAND HERE, SPOTS VON
 MILLER COMING RIGHT AT HIM.
 EVEN WHEN YOUR DEFENSE IS DOING
 EVERYTHING THEY SHOULD BE DOING,
 THERE ARE SITUATIONS WHERE YOU
 CANNOT BE PATRICK MAHOMES
 BECAUSE HE COMES UP WITH SOME
 UNTHINKABLE MOMENT HERE.
 HIS ATHLETICISM.
 VISION OF THE FIELD AND HIS
 ABILITY TO STAY IN THE POCKET
 MAKE PLAYS AND OUTSIDE THE
 POCKET IS WHERE HE'S PERHAPS
 PROBABLY MOST DANGEROUS.
 YOUR HIGHLIGHT.
 OH, WAIT.
 HE'S YOUR HIGHLIGHT KING.
 HE IS MY HIGHLIGHT KING
 BECAUSE HE IS A HIGHLIGHT
 MACHINE.
 AS YOU CAN SEE, HE'S BROKEN AT
 LEAST 47 TACKLES ON THAT ONE TO
 GET TO THE END ZONE.
 HE'S JUST PUTTING HIS FOOT IN
 THE GROUND.
 WILL NOT BE DENIED AGAINST
 PHILADELPHIA.
 OBVIOUSLY A RIVALRY IN THAT
 DIVISION AND HE'S TAKING OFF ON
 THAT ONE.
 IN THIS ONE, THIS ONE IS -- THIS
 ONE IS PRETTY GOOD.
 OKAY.
 WE KNOW THIS GUY GETS A
 TREMENDOUS BLOCK BY 73.
 THIS RUN IS JUST INDICATIVE OF
 THE TYPE OF ATHLETE THAT SAQUON
 BARKLEY IS.
 HE CAN SHAKE GUYS BEHIND HIM.
 IN FRONT OF HIM AND HAS THE
 SPEED TO OUTRUN ANYONE IN THE
 LEAGUE.
 THAT'S WHATE SEE HERE AND
 ALWAYS ON DISPLAY.
 A BONUS, DIANNA, WHEN I HEAR
 THIS ONE, HURDLE.
 NOT ONLY A HANDFUL OF GUYS THAT
 CAN PROBABLY COUNT THEM ON ONE
 HAND WHO CAN HURTLE GUYS LIKE
 THAT AND KEEP IT MOVING.
 YOU.
 YOU TALK ABOUT THAT PLAY.
 EXACTLY.
 PILE ON YOUR GIANTS BUT THE
 FACT HE WAS ABLE TO DO THAT WITH
 THAT O-LINE.
 MIKE TANNENBAUM.
 I GOT KYLER MURRAY.
 I WAS AT THIS GAME.
 HIS RESILIENCY WAS UNBELIEVABLE.
 THEY GOT OUTPLAYED BADLY IN THE
 FIRST HALF.
 COMES OUT IN THE SECOND HALF.
 HE STEPS UP OUT OF THE POCKET.
 KEEPS HIS EYES DOWNING THE FEEL.
 PUTS SO MUCH PRESSURE ON A
 DEFENSE.
 THROWS A REALLY ACCURATE PASS.
 THIS WAS A GREAT PLAY.
 GOT OKLAHOMA BACK IN THE GAME.
 THIS WAS ANOTHER GAME I WAS AT.
 WEST VIRGINIA'S DEFENSE WAS
 HORRIFIC IN THIS GAME.
 IF THEY WERE PLAYING FLAG
 FOOTBALL, KYLER MURRAY STILL
 WOULD HAVE GOT UNTOUCHED AND --
 FLAG FOOTBALL.
 YEAH.
 THIS WAS WHAT ARIZONA WAS
 HOPING FOR.
 LOOK AT HOW MANY GUYS HE CAN
 MAKE MISS IN SPACE AND HAVE THE
 SPEED TO TAKE IT ALL THE WAY.
 TH AMOUNT OF PRESSURE HE'LL PUT
 ON DEMPS WILL BE FORMIDABLE IN
 THE FALL BECAUSE IT WILL BE HIS
 ARM AND SPEED.
 LOOK AT THIS ONE.
 OKLAHOMA STATE, BIG RIVALRY
 GAME.
 AGAIN, 50 YARDS DOWN THE FIELD.
 HOLLYWOOD BROWN IN STRIDE.
 THIS GUY WILL BE A DYNAMIC
 PLAYMAKER.
 HE IS A HIGHLIGHT MUNGONGO, THE
 HIGHLIGHT TEAMMAKER AND ARIZONA
 CARDINAL FANS IS WHAT THEY'RE
 LOOKING FORWARD TO IN THE FALL.
 HOPING.
 WE TOLD YOU WE'D LET YOU VOTE.
 NARROWED THE FIELD.

 HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL COACH ROB
 MENDEZ WHO WILL BE THE RECIPIENT
 OF THE JIMMY V AWARD FOR
 PERSEVERANCE.
 BORN WITH AN EXTREMELY RARE
 CONDITION THAT AFFECTS BLESS
 THAN 100 PEOPLE IN THE WORLD,
 MENDEZ FOUND HIS CALLING
 COACHING A SPORT HE WAS NEVER
 ABLE TO PLAY HIMSELF.
 FEATURED CHRONICLED AND HIS
 FIRST SEASON AS A HEAD FOOTBALL
 COACH CAPTURING THE INSPIRING
 AND UNLIKELY STORY OF A COACH
 WHO TRANSFORMED A GROUP OF YOUNG
 ATHLETES FROM SKEPTICS INTO
 BELIEVERS.

 AT THIS TIME I JUST WANT TO
 INTRODUCE TO YOU SOMEBODY I
 THINK CAN REALLY HELP TURN THIS
 PROGRAM AROUND.
 A COACH THAT I HIRED BECAUSE I
 WAS IMPRESSED WITH HIS KNOWLEDGE
 OF THE GAME.
 HIS PASSION BLEW ME AWAY.
 EVERYTHING ELSE THAT'S ON TOP OF
 THAT IN TERMS OF WHO HE IS AND
 WHAT HE DOES ON A DAY-TO-DAY
 BASIS INSPIRES ME.
 YOUR NEW COACH, ROB MENDEZ.
 [ APPLAUSE ]

 IT WAS AWFUL.
 IT WAS REALLY, REALLY AWFUL.
 I HAD TO KEEP ROBERT.
 IN THE BACK OF MY MIND ASKING
 WHY, WHY MY SON?
 YOU KNOW, LESS THAN 100 BORN
 LIKE HIM IN THE WORLD.
 WHAT AM I GOING TO DID WITH THIS
 BOY?
 IT WAS HARD TO SEE HIM.
 I REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO SEE
 ROBERT.
 I DIDN'T SEE ROBERT FOR ABOUT
 TWO WEEKS BECAUSE I JUST -- I
 DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
 I JUST REMEMBER STARING, YOU
 KNOW, THERE WAS A LOT OF
 STARING.
 LIKE HE WAS NOT A HUMAN OR
 SOMETHING.
 BUT HE'S DIFFERENT.
 YEAH.
 HE SEES PEOPLE'S STARING AS
 AN OPPORTUNITY.
 EVERYONE OUT THERE, YOU KNOW
 ME, ROBERT MENDEZ.
 THINGS THAT YOU AND I GET TO
 DO IN TEN MINUTES MIGHT TAKE HIM
 AN HOUR BUT HE NEVER COMPLAINED
 ABOUT IT.
 ROBERT WAS JUST A REALLY EASY
 CHILD.
 AND HE JUST WAS REALLY, REALLY
 HAPPY.
 WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE TEAM?
 SAN FRANCISCO 49ers.
 HAS A GIFT THAT DOESN'T
 REQUIRE HIM TO BE PHYSICAL.
 MAKING HIM AWARE OF THAT I THINK
 HE JUST TOOK THE BALL AND RAN.
 I THINK THE MOST DIFFICULT
 PART ABOUT HAVING NO ARMS AND NO
 LEGS IS SIMPLY NOT BEING ABLE TO
 PLAY SPORTS.
 I DON'T SHOW IT.
 I'M GOOD AT NOT SHOWING IT BUT,
 YEAH, I GET MAD.
 I GET MAD AT GOD.
 I GET MAD AT THE LORD.
 LIKE WHY.
 HIS FRESHMAN YEAR AND HE WAS
 STANDING BEHIND THE FENCE AT A
 DISTANCE WATCHING THEM PRACTICE.
 THAT WAS THE BEGIG.
 WE WANTED TO GET HIM INVOLVED
 IN THE PROGRAM SO INVITED HIM TO
 BE OUR MANAGER.
 THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I COULD
 DO.
 THEY OBVIOUSLY KNEW I COULDN'T
 PLAY BUT TO INCLUDE ME MADE ME
 FEEL A PART OF IT.
 MADE ME FEEL I GUESS YOU CAN SAY
 NORMAL.
 HE PAID ATTENTION TO US AS
 COACHES BUT HE LEARNED THE GAME
 BY MADDEN FOOTBALL.
 HE CREATED GAME PLANS ON MADDEN
 AND THEN HE'D COME TO PRACTICE
 AND TRY TO CE THE SAME GAME
 PLANS AND EXECUTE THEM THE SAME
 WAY.
 I STARTED TO GIVING ROBERT A
 LITTLE MORE RESPONSIBILITY WITH
 MY QUARTERBACKS.
 EYES ON THE QUARTERBACK.
 EYES ON THE QUARTERBACK.
 AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW
 HE WAS THERE RUNNING THE DRILLS
 FOR US.
 GO, GO, GO, GO.
 WHEN YOU ROLL OUT, BIG EYES.
 BIG EYES, OKAY.
 HIS ABILITY TO STUDY THE GAME
 AND HIS ABILITY TO TRANSLATE
 THOSE THINGS TO THE KIDS IS
 UNMATCHED BY MOST OF THE COACHES
 THAT I KNOW.
 RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE LINE.
 RAM OVER.
 W 6 ORBIT.
 GOOD JOB.
 AWESOME.
'VE BEEN OVERLOOKED THE LAST
 THREE OR FOUR YEARS I'VE BEEN
 READY FOR IT.
 WHEN I GO TO A JOB INTERVIEW
 I FEEL LIKE SOMETIMES SCARING IS
 NOT THE RIGHT WORD.

 SURPRISES AND I DON'T THOUGH HOW
 THEY'LL TAKE THE SURPRISE.
 AS HE ROLLS OUT, TO BE
 BRUTALLY HONEST WHEN I SAW THAT,
 HOW CAN THIS GUY COACH.
 AND AS HE COMES CLOSE, GIVE ME A
 FIST PUMP.
 GIVE ME A FIST PUMP.
 I JUST GIVE HIM A FIST PUMP ON
 THE SHOULDER AND ALL THAT NERVES
 THAT I HAD WAS JUST MELTED AWAY.
 WE HAD OTHER POLITICS SO I KNEW
 IN MY HEART THAT HE WOULD BE A
 GREAT FIT FOR THESE YOUNG
 ATHLETES.
 I REMEMBER WHEN COACH HIRED
 ME AND RECRUITED ME OFF CAMPUS,S
 OF LIKE, YES, I FELT REALLY
 ACCOMPLISHED BECAUSE IT TOOK ME
 SO LONG.
 I KNEW I'VE BEEN READY FOR IT
 AND I'VE BEEN OVERLOOKED AND
 FINALLY SOMEONE GAVE ME THE
 OPPORTUNITY SO I REALLY
 APPRECIATED THAT.
 AT THIS TIME I JUST WANT TO
 INTRODUCE TO YOU YOUR NEW JV
 HEAD COACH, ROB MENDEZ.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 APPRECIATE THAT, COACH CABLE.
 THANK YOU, COACH.
 YOU KNOW, FOOTBALL IS MY
 PASSION.
 I CAN'T WAIT TO GET TO KNOW
 EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU.
 BELIEVE IN YOURSELF, YOUR
 TEAMMATES AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
 ARE WE CLEAR, GENTLEMEN?
 YES, SIR.
 I'M EXCITED, GUYS.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A LITTLE
 SHOCKING AND THERE WAS JOKES
 GOING AROUND.
 TYPICAL TEENAGERS, YOU KNOW, A
 GUY WITH NO ARMS OR LEG, NOT A
 LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SEEN THAT.
 IF YOU'REEN TAKACK THAT'S
 JUST NATURAL AND THAT'S HUMAN.
 BUT AFTER THE FIRST TWO SECONDS,
 IT'S JUST A NORMAL GUY.
 I DON'T CARE HOW GOOD YOU
 ARE, I DON'T CARE HOW
 EXPERIENCED YOU ARE, YOU GUYS
 ARE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING AS A
 TEAM.
 THOUGH HE MAY NOT LOOK LIKE A
 COACH HE DEFINITELY ACTS LIKE
 ONE.

 SO WHAT WE'LL TEACH RIGHT NOW
 IS CALLED 31 ZONE.
 HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE GAME
 TORE SOMEBODY THAT HASN'T
 ACTUAL GON THROUGH IT IS
 IMPRESSIVE.
 ON HIS PHONE HE CAN DIAGRAM A
 PLAY FASTER THAN I CAN DO WITH A
 PEN AND PAPER.
 THERE'S DEFINITELY DOUBTERS
 OUT THERE LIKE PARENTS, LIKE MY
 SON IS GETTING COACHED BY A
 QUARTERBACK WITH A GUY WITH NO
 ARMS AND NO LEGS.
 THAT LIGHTS A FIRE UNDER MY BUTT
 AND PROBABLY GETS ME EXCITED
 BECAUSE I REALLY JUST TRY TO
 PROVE PEOPLE WRONG ABOUT IT.
 WHEN THEY SEE HIM AND WITNESS
 HIM AND HEAR HIM, I'D LIKE TO
 BELIEVE THAT THEY TAKE A MOMENT
 TO EVALUATE THEMSELVES AND
 ANYTHING THAT THEY'VE GONE
 THROUGH IN LIFE CAN'T BE MORE
 DIFFICULT THAN WHAT HE ENDURES
 ON A DAILY BASIS.
 ONE THING I CARE ABOUT MORE
 THAN ANYTHING IS BEING A FAMILY.
 THAT IS ONE THING I TAKE PRIDE
 ON.
 I LOVE PEOPLE.
 I LOVE YOU, I LOVE, I LOVE YOU.
 I LOVE EVERYONE.
 SO IF YOU GUYS CAN'T GET ALONG,
 YOU BETTER GET OFF ME.
 WHOM AM I GOING TO GO TO?
 SO, SO, SO.
 IT WAS A FRACTURED ORBIT TALL
 BONE AND MY CHEEKBONE WAS
 FRACTURED AS WELL.
 I COULDN'T SLEEP.
 I ULDN'T CHEW.

 I JUST FELT BAD FOR HIM.
 HE'S GOT A HARD LIFE.
 I TRY TO MAKE IT AS EASY AS I
 CAN.
 THINGS THAT YOU AND I TAKE
 FOR GRANTED LIKE BRUSHING YOUR
 TEETH OR WASHING YOUR FACE OR
 TAKING A SHOWER OR GOING TO THE
 RESTROOM, ROBERT NEEDS SOMEONE
 TO HELP HI
 BUT HE'S TOUGH.
 TWO DAYS LATER EVANS AT HIS
 PRACTICE.
 WIDEN OUT.
 WIDEN OUT BOTH OF YOU.
 HIS THING IS, NO, I GOT TO BE
 THERE FOR THE KIDS.
 GO TO THE FLACK.
 HE'S BEEN WAITING TO BE A
 HEAD COACH FOR A LONG TIME.
 I DIDN'T WANT TO LET THEM
 DOWN.
 I DIDN'T WANT TO LET THE KIDS
 DOWN.
 I JUST CAN'T STAY AWAY, I GUESS.
 ME BEING CHALLENGED HAS BEEN MY
 MOTIVATION.
 ALL I GOT TO SAY IS WHO SAYS
 I CAN'T.
 [ CHANTING "NOBODY" ]
 WHO SAYS I CAN'T ORIGINALLY
 CAME FROM KNEE JUST HAVING A
 DRIVE TO ACCOMPLISH WHATEVER
 PEOPLE DOUBTED ME FOR.
 WHO SAYS I CAN'T.
 NOBODY.
 WHO SAYS I CAN'T.
 NOBODY.
 WHO SAYS I CAN'T.
 NOBODY.
 YEAH!
 HE'S WILLING TO DO ALL OF
 THAT.
 WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?
 IT'S GO TIME.
 WE'VE BEEN WORKING HARD ALL
 SUMMER LONG.
 ON THREE, ONE, TWO, THREE.
 OKAY, GUYS, LET'S GO.
 LET'S GO.
 38 STRETCH.
 TOUCHDOWN.
 THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT.
 SAMMY, LET'S GO.
 THOSE KIDS FOUGHT EVERY
 SINGLE GAME.
 I CAN'T REMEMBER ONE GAME WE
 WERE BIGGER THAN THE OTHER TEAM
 BUT WE GOT THE JOB DONE.
 THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING
 ABOUT.
 THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
 WE GOT THE MOMENTUM.
 KEEP IT UP.
 LET'S GO.
 THEY'VE HAD MOSTLY LOSING
 SEASONS.
 HE JUST REALLY HAS DONE A JOB
 THAT I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SEE
 OTHER COACHES DO AT THAT LEVEL
 BEFORE.
 I'M TRAINED TO SEND THEM OVER
 THE MIDDLE BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO
 BE RIGHT HERE OVER THE MIDDLE.
 LET'S GO.
 YEAH.
 IT'S GOOD.
 APPRECIATE IT, GUYS.
 LET'S GO.
 WHO SAYS I CAN'T.
 WHAT?
 WHO SAYS I CAN'T?
 GOOD MORNING AND HELLO,
 PROSPECT AND SOPRANO HIGH.
 WINNER TODAY WINS THE LEAGUE.
 REMEMBER THIS, I'M PROUD OF
 EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU.
 WE'RE NOT DONE YET SO LET'S
 FINISH THE JOB OFF RIGHT NOW.
 MIGHT TAKE A MIRACLE PLAY TO
 SCORE THE ONLY POINTS OF THIS
 CONTEST.
 INTERCEPTED.
 4:37 TO PLAY IN THE FOURTH
 QUARTER.
 LOOKING FOR THE FIRST POINT.
 KICK ON THE WAY.
 HAS THE DISTANCE AND IT'S GOOD.
 AND SOPRANO TAKES A 3-0 LEAD.
 ACTUALLY GUYS, THIS RIGHT
 HERE, 180 SMASH.
 FOURTH AND 14 FOR THE
 PANTHERS.
 FOURTH DOWN PLAY, JACKSON ON TO
 HIS LEFT AND IT'S INCOMPLETE.
 SOPRANO GETS THE WIN AND TAKES
 THE DIVISION TITLE WITH A WIN
 THIS AFTERNOON OVER PROSPECT.
 COME ON.
 THAT WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT
 THING TO REMEMBER THAT, OKAY.
 THAT'S WHY WE BUILT THIS TEAM
 OFF WAS FAMILY.
 WE GOT GOOD DAYS AND BAD DAYS
 AND WE CAME THIS FAR AS A TEAM.
 I'M VERY PROUD OF THIS TEAM.
 IT'S GOING TO HURT TODAY.
 AND THAT'S OKAY IF IT HURTS
 BECAUSE WE CARED A LOT BECAUSE
 WE LOVED THIS GAME OF FOOTBALL.
 I REALLY SINCERELY WANT YOU GUYS
 TO UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH I
 APPRECIATE THIS.
 YOU GUYS HAVE GIVEN ME A
 LIFETIME OF MEMORIES.
 OUR OPPONENTS, THEY'D ALWAYS
 DOUBT HIM BECAUSE THEY SEE A MAN
 IN A WHEELCHAIR.
 TO US WE SEE OUR COACH WHO IS
 PERFECT.
 AFTER THE GAME, MAKES ME FEEL
 LIKE PROUD TO HAVE HIM AS MY
 COACH.
 THESE KIDS WOULD FOLLOW HIM
 NO MATTER WHERE HE GOES.
 WE CAN SEE THE CHANGES IN THE
 KIDS.
 CAN I GET A HUG?
 YOU WANT THE BEST FOR YOUR
 CHILDREN AND I TOLD HIM ONE
 TIME, NOT A LOT OF MONEY IN
 THIS, ROBERT.
 AND HE TOLD ME, NOT EVERYBODY
 DOES WHAT THEY DO FOR MONEY.
 HE'S RIGHT.
 THEY GAVE ME THE FEELING OF
 IMPORTANCE.
 AND I DON'T THINK THEY KNOW THAT
 AND UNDERSTAND THAT.
 MAYBE THEY WILL ONE DAY BUT I
 LOVE THOSE KIDS AND I'M ALWAYS
 GOING TO REMEMBER THEM.
 YEAH.
 I THINK WE MAKE A PERFECT
 TEAM.
 CAN WE AGREE ON THAT.
 YES, SIR.
 CAN WE AGREE ON THAT.
 YES, SIR.
 WHO SAYS I CAN'T?
 NOBODY.
 WHO SAYS I CAN'T?
 NOBODY.
 WHO SAYS I CAN'T?
 NOBODY.
 YEAH!

      Lo que yo quiero estar           con mi hijo.
      I know that's not true.
   And the shelters really don't    know what to do with them.
    I just got another person    at D.H.S. to confirm this.
        I have this number.
      We're going to publish            the story.
      THIS IS A PAYDAY BAR.
    AND THERE'S ONLY ONE THING    YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT IT.
  IT HAS A TRUCK LOAD OF PEANUTS  SURROUNDING SWEET CARAMEL.

    LOOK AT ALL THOSE PEANUTS.
    BEST PART IS IT HELPS    YOU GET THROUGH YOUR DAY.

 JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER WILL
 ENTER TRAINING CAMP WITH THE
 PITTSBURGH STEELERS NUMBER ONE
 WIDE RECEIVER FOR THE FIRST TIME
 IN HIS CAREER.
 HERE'S MR. SMITH-SCHUSTER ON
 WHAT IT'S LIKE AND THE
 EXPECTATION OF STEPING INTO THAT
 ROLE.
 ALL THESE PEOPLE SAY YOU'RE
 THE NUMBER ONE GUY THIS YEAR BUT
 MORE FOR MYSELF I SEE MORE
 OPPORTUNITY FOR ME AND OTHER
 GUYS TO STEP UP.
 A.B. HAVING 100 CATCHES OVER A
 THOUSAND YARDS.
 THOSE YARDS, THOSE CATCHES WILL
 BE SPREAD OUT BETWEEN OUR
 OFFENSE AND JAMES CONNER AND
 JAMES WASHINGTON, DONTE UPON
 CHIEF.
 A LOT OF GAMES, JAMES SAMUELS.
 THERE'S SO MANY GUYS THAT WILL
 GET MORE TOUCH, MORE YARD, MORE
 YAC TO HELP THEM INDIVIDUALLY.
 AT THE END OF THE DAY I'M THE
 SAME JUJU.
 LAST YEAR I WAS 21, THIS YEAR
 I'M 22 SAME THING.
 THE OLDER WISER MORE MATURE
 JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER WITH A GOOD
 JAC REFERENCE.
 ALWAYS.
 GOT US THINKING, OBVIOUSLY
 BIG SHOES TO FILL WITH ANTONIO
 BROWN DEPARTED.
 HE'S NOW AN OAKLAND RAIDER SO
 LET'S GO ONE BY ONE RECEPTIONS,
 MORE OR LESS, RAN TONE YORE OWE
 JUJU.
 JUJU MADE ALL MY POINTS AND
 WILL SPREAD THE BALL AROUND AND
 HAVE A HEAD COACH IN JON GRUDEN
 THE PLAY CALLER GAVE UP A LOT OF
 MONEY, A.L. WILL HAVE MORE
 RECEPTIONS.
 I THINK JON GRUDEN IS
 MOTIVATED TO GET BROWN THE
 FOOTBALL.
 TOUCHDOWNS.
 A.B. AS WELL.
 AND, YOU KNOW, YOU ACTUALLY TEED
 ME UP PERFECTLY BECAUSE I THINK
 IF THERE IS ANYONE THAT WANTS TO
 MAKE ANTONIO BROWN WORK IN
 OAKLAND BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO
 FIGURE OUT WHY THEY GAVE HIM ALL
 THE MONEY IT WOULD BE JON GRUDEN
 SO HE'S CALLING ALL THE SHOTS
 AND IN TERMS OF WIDE RECEIVERS
 WE CAN DEBATE ALL DAY LONG WHO
 IS THE BEST BUT KNOW HOW SPECIAL
 A.B. CAN BE AND AS SOON AS HE
 FIGURES OUT THAT CHEMISTRY WITH
 DEREK CARR HE WILL HAVE MORE.
 RECEPTION, TOUCHDOWNS AND HOW
 ABOUT ALL PURPOSE YARDS, VICTOR
 CRUZ.
 I'LL GIVE JUJU SOME LOVE
 HERE.
 FINALLY.
 MIKE AND DIANNA HAVE NOT
 GIVEN HIM ANY LOVE BUT I'M
 GIVING HIM YARDS.
 IN THOSE PRESSURE SITUATIONS BEN
 WILL LOOK FOR HIM TO BE THE
 NUMBER ONE RECEIVER AND GET HIM
 THE BALL IN SPACE AN DEEP ROUTES
 AND CAN RUN ANY ROUTE IN THE
 BOOK.
 INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THEY USE
 HIM AS THE NUMBER ONE GUY.
 A TEAM GAME AND ALL OF THOSE
 THINGS ARE WHAT THEY ARE.
 WHAT REALLY MATTERS, OF COURSE,
 YOU HOPE IS THE NUMBER OF WINS
 FROM EACH TEAM.
 WE GOT THE STEELERS AND RAIDERS.
 WHO GETS THE EDGE.
 PITTSBURGH, IMPROVEMENT WITH
 OAKLAND ON OFFENSE, JOSH JACOB,
 TERRELL WILLIAMS, A.B.
 OBVIOUSLY, ANOTHER YEAR WITH
 DEREK CARR AND JON GRUDEN REALLY
 WORRIED ABOUT THE DEFENSE AND
 THEY LOST KHALIL MACK.
 WHILE THEY DRAFTED THOSE PLAYERS
 FROM CLEMSON IN THE FIRST ROUND
 IT WILL TAKE A WHILE TO GET
 GOING AND BE A WORK IN PROGRESS
 IN TERMS OF HOW THEY ARE ON
 DEFENSE.
 I'LL GO WITH MIKE TOMLIN AND
 VERY MATURE PITTSBURGH STEELER
 ORGANIZATION.
 I THINK THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD
 BET.
 HOW ABOUT CELEBRATIONS?
 IS THIS TEAM A QUESTION?
 NOT A QUESTION AT ALL.
 I'M GOING WITH JUJU MAIN LAY
 BECAUSE IT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO
 BE HIM TO SCORE TO DO THE
 CELEBRATION.
 HE'S MADE THAT CLEAR.
 EVERYBODY IS IN ON THIS THING
 WHETHER IT'S HIM OR McDONALD OR
 ANY OTHER PERSON ON THAT TEAM
 THEY'LL BE CELEBRATING AND JUJU
 WILL BE LEADING THE WAY.
 LET ME TELL YOU IF YOU DID
 NOT SEE IT JUJU WAS WITH US
 ABOUT AN HOUR AGO AND SAID HE IS
 WORKING ON BEN ROETHLISBERGER TO
 GET HIM INVOLVED.
 HE'S NOT COMMITTED BUT TRYING.
 VALIANT EFFORT.
 WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.
 THE RESIDENT CELEBRATION EXPERT
 FOR US.
 LIKE ANYTHING CELEBRATION WE
 HAVE TO GO TO HIM.
 HERE I AM TAKING A BOW FOR
 YOU.
 WE HAVE ONE MORE CATEGORY.
 HOW ABOUT THE DRAMA.
 UH-OH.
 THE DRAMA.
 IS IT ON THERE OR NO.
 WE'LL SEE HERE.
 I GUESS NOT.
 ALL RIGHT.
 WE'LL JUST DO THE DRAMA.
 I'M GOING TO GO WITH WHAT
 HISTORY SAYS AND I THINK IT'S
 GOING TO BE ANTONIO BROWN ON
 THIS AND I'LL STICK WITH THAT.
 I LIKE THE WAY JUJU
 SMITH-SCHUSTER IS MATURING INTO
 NOT JUST A MENTOR TO THESE
 YOUNGER PLAYERS BUT AN ACTUAL
 LEADER ON THE STEELERS TEAM AND
 FOR ANTONIO BROWN THERE ARE A
 LOT OF PERSONALITIES ON THE
 ROSTER.
 JON GRUDEN IS THE FOCAL POINT OF
 THIS TEAM NO MATTER WHO IS ON IT
 BUT I THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE
 POINTS DURING THE SEASON WHERE
 THE A.B. OF PITTSBURGH WILL SHOW
 ITS FACE IN OAKLAND.
 YOU CANNOT -- WE WILL NOT GET TO
 THIS SEASON WITHOUT HIM GETTING
 IRKED WITH DEREK CARR.
 NO WAY.
 IT TAKES ONE BALL ENALE HE BE
 LIKE, REALLY.
 PUT SOME MONEY ON IT.
 THE ESPYS ARE RIGHT AROUND THE
 CORN EVER.
 WHO IS GETTING YOUR VOTE FOR THE
 BEST RECORD-BREAKING
 PERFORMANCE?
 COME ON.
 YOU KNOW DREW BREES WANTS YOUR
 VOTE.
 DREW BREES HAS DONE IT.
 THE NFL'S ALL-TIME LEADING
 PASSER.
 YOU'RE IN THE WAR ZONE,
 RIGHT.
       Remember that degree       you got in taxation?
       Of course you don't       because you didn't!
    Your job isn't    understanding tax code...
  it's understanding why that...
 will get him a body like that...
              MOVE!
             ...that.
        Your job isn't        doing hard work...
              Here.
       ...it's making       her do hard work...
   ...and getting paid for it.
  Snap and sort your expenses to  save over $4,600 at tax time.
             Jody...
    ...it's time to get yours!
     QUICKBOOKS. BACKING YOU.
            It's open!
               Hey.
         This is amazing.
     With moderate to severe       ulcerative colitis,
          Are you okay?
      even when I was there,
  I never knew when my symptoms
       would keep us apart.
     So I talked to my doctor          about HUMIRA.
  I learned HUMIRA can help get,
    and keep UC under control
  when other medications haven't       worked well enough.
   And it helps people achieve       control that lasts.
    So you can experience few
         or no symptoms.
  <i> HUMIRA can lower your ability</i>       <i> to fight infections,</i>
     <i> including tuberculosis.</i>
     <i> Serious, sometimes fatal</i>     <i> infections and cancers,</i>
     <i> including lymphoma, have</i>            <i> happened;</i>
    <i> as have blood, liver, and</i>     <i> nervous system problems,</i>
 <i>serious allergic reactions, and</i> <i>new or worsening heart failure.</i>
        <i> Before treatment,</i>        <i> get tested for TB.</i>
 <i>Tell your doctor if you've been</i>             <i> to areas</i>
 <i>where certain fungal infections</i>           <i> are common,</i>
      <i> and if you've had TB,</i>
           <i> hepatitis B,</i>
     <i> are prone to infections,</i>
    <i> or have flu-like symptoms</i>            <i> or sores.</i>
  <i> Don't start HUMIRA if you have</i>          <i> an infection.</i>
   Be there for you, and them.
   Ask your gastroenterologist          about HUMIRA.
           With HUMIRA,       control is possible.
      <i> How do you gauge the</i>      <i> greatness of an SUV?</i>
      <i> Is it to carry cargo</i>    <i> or to carry on a legacy?</i>
      <i> Its show of strength</i>  <i> or its sign of intelligence?</i>
    <i> In crossing harsh terrain</i>     <i> or breaking new ground?</i>
     <i> This is the time to get</i>      <i> an exceptional offer</i>
       <i> on the Mercedes of</i>      <i> your midsummer dreams</i>

    I can't believe we broke   old man Hennessey's window
  Correction dude, you broke.     I just threw the ball.
  This is really bad.  What are we going to do?
               WE?
     Go to the door and ask       for the ball back.
        Are you serious?
    It's my ball Myrtlebeck!
          I'm so dead.
          I'd run away.
        Yeah, to Uruguay.
    Kiss your life goodbye.        Sorry. Let's go.
    Bye. See ya. Remember me         in your will.

 DREW B BREES FINDS HIMSELF ONLY 35 YARDS AWAWAY.
 IT'S ABOUT OUR STRENGTH.
 JUST PEYTON MANNING LEFT TO
 PASS.
 HE STARTS IN THE SHOTGUN.
 DROPS BACK.
 LOOKS TO THE FAR SIDELINE.
 WIDE OPEN AND WHAT A WAY TO DO
 IT.
 UH-OH.
 DREW BREES IS THE NFL'S
 ALL-TIME LEADING PASSER.
 HEY, BOYS.
 HOW ABOUT THAT, HUH.
 ONLY ONE WORD THAT COMES TO
 MIND.
 GREATNESS.
 WELL, WE CONTINUE TO
 HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE STAVETSKIS
 AND THE NFL THAT EARNED ESPY
 NOMINATIONS THIS YEAR.
 THE AMAZING MOMENT FROM DREW
 BREES IS UP FOR THE ESPY FOR
 BEST RECORD-BREAKING
 PERFORMANCE.
 BREES BROKE THE PASSING RECORD
 WHEN HE PASSED PEYTON MANNING'S
 MARK AND, VICTOR, YOU MADE THIS
 POINT YESTERDAY, IT'S TRUE.
 I THINK LAST YEAR WAS HIS BEST
 BET AT WINNING MVP.
 YOU JUST HAD THIS PESKY PATRICK
 MAHOMES WHO DID THINGS THAT JUST
 DIDN'T SEEM POSSIBLE TO KEEP
 BREES FROM WINNING THAT AWARD.
 EXACTLY.
 HOW DO YOU AMASS SUCH A
 MONUMENTAL RECORD LIKE THIS ON
 AN ILLUSTRIOUS AND NOT WIN THE
 LEAGUE MVP ONE TIME.
 PEYTON MANNING, TOM BRADY, HE'S
 GOT TO GET IT ONE TIME.
 HE'S PUTTING UP NUMBERS EACH AND
 EVERY YEAR AND THERE ARE YEARS
 HE GOES UNDER THE RADAR WITH
 THOSE PLAYMAKERS AND EVERYBODY
 HE HAS.
 THIS IS A YEAR, LET'S PUT A NICE
 PRETTY RED BOW ON THIS CAREER
 AND PUT A LEAGUE MVP UNDER MY
 BELL AND GET BACK TO THE BIG
 DANCE HOPEFULLY AND KEEP THINGS
 GOING.
 SO IN FAIRNESS HE HAS BEEN A
 SUPER BOWL MVP, TWO-TIME
 OFFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE YEAR.
 BUT, YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE THING,
 QUALITY QUARTERBACK OF DREW
 BREES, HE WOULD TAKE A LOMBARDI
 TROPHY ANY DAY OF THE WEEK.
 AT LEAST GIVE HIM ONE LEAGUE
 MVP.
 HE'S EARNED IT.
 HOW ABOUT THE BEST OF THE
 BEST OF DREW BREES.
 THIS IS VINTAGE RIGHT HERE.
 VINTAGE.

 PLAY ACTION, DEEP TO ERIC
 PARKER, BREAKS A TACKLE FOR A
 79-YARD TOUCHDOWN.
 I LIKE IT.
 SHOWING THAT ARM OFF.
 BLACK AND WHITE THERE.
 REAL EARLY.
 PIXELATED.
 GRAINY, I LOVE IT.
 PIXELATED.
 THERE YOU GO.
 2014 AGAINST THE PACKERS.
 THREE STEPS UP.
 JUST LAYS THIS ONE PERFECTLY
 INTO THE ARMS OF BRANDIN COOKS.
 A 50-YARD TOUCHDOWN STRIKE.
 A DIME.
 WHAT IS I DIME.
 YOU SEE QUARTERBACKS STEP UP
 IN THE POCKET KEEPING HIS EYES
 DOWN THE FIELD.
 PUTS SO MUCH PRESSURE ON THE
 DEFENSE.
 '06 AGAINST THE BENGAL,
 HANDOFF HERE.
 A FLEAFLICKER.
 LOVE IT.
 AND THEN JOE HORN THERE
 BETWEEN TWO DEFENDERS, A 72-YARD
 TOUCHDOWN AND IT'S THAT KIND OF
 ARM THAT WE SEE.
 HEY, I LIKE IT.
 I LIKE IT.
 MOVING NOW TO THE MODERN DAY.
 MISS THAT.
 TO TED GINN IN THE END ZONE.
 CONSISTENCY WE'RE SEEING HERE
 IS -- HE'S NOT EVEN BEING
 TOUCHED.
 BARELY PEOPLE AROUND HIM WHILE
 HE'S MAKING THESE THROWS LIKE
 THAT'S INDICATIVE TO THE TYPE OF
 TEAM HE'S BEEN AROUND.
 THAT OFFENSIVE LINE TAKES GOOD
 CARE OF HIM.
 '06 CHAMPIONSHIP, SAINTS AND
 BEARS.
 BREES TO REGGIE BUSH.
 GREAT EXAMPLE OF AN EFFECTIVE
 QUARTERBACK PLAY.
 SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO THROW AS
 HARD AS YOU CAN.
 THAT WAS A GREAT TOUCH THROW TO
 THE RUNNING BACK WHO TAKES IT
 ALL THE WAY.
 WHAT TOUCH HE HAS.
 SUCH AN UNDERRATED ASPECT OF
 PLAYING QUARTERBACK.
 THEN 2016 AGAINST THE
 RAIDERS, THE LONGEST CAREER
 PASS, A 90 -- THIS SAYS 98 -- I
 ALWAYS HAVE TO -- YARDS AFTER --
 BRANDIN COOKS.
 AN INCREDIBLE CAREER.
 PERHAPS A FUTURE NFL MVP.
 YOU CAN VOTE ON THE ESPYS AT
 ESPYS.COM.
 AGAIN, BREES UP FOR
 RECORD-BREAKING PERFORMANCE
 ALONG WITH THREE OTHER MOMENTS
 INCLUDING CLAY THOMPSON'S RECORD
 FOR THREE-POINTERS IN A GAME
 WITH 14.
 ALL RIGHT.

 WHO ARE YOU HIGHLIGHTS.
