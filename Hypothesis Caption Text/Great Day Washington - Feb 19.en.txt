 GOOD MORNING.
 WELCOME TO GREAT DAY
 WASHINGTON.
  TODAY WE MEET A LOCAL WOMAN
 WHO IS A CONTESTANT
 ON THE 38th SEASON OF SURVIVOR.
  WE GET THE LOW DOWN FROM
 HER.
 FIRST LET'S LOOK AT THE WINTER
 WEATHER THAT'S COMING
 IN TOMORROW.
 MARY, WHAT'S THE LATEST
  GOOD MORNING.
 YES, THIS WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT
 WINTER STORM THAT'S
 COMING OUR WAY, PRODUCING THREE
 TO SIX INCHES OF
 SNOW AND SLEET COMBINED OVER
 METRO DC.
 ALL THESE AREAS YOU SEE IN
 WHITE IN THE
 NEIGHBORHOODS.
 SILVER SPRING, COLLEGE PARK,
 THREE TO SIX INCHES
 POSSIBLE, DOWN THROUGH THE
 FREDRICKSBURG AREA.
 HIGHER AMOUNTS NORTH AND WEST
 OF DC ALONG FRONT
 ROYAL, WINCHESTER AND
 WESTMINISTER.
 SIX TO EIGHT INCHES OF SNOW AND
 EVEN SLEET COMBINED
 IN THOSE AREAS WITH THE WINTER
 WEATHER THREAT THAT'S
 COMING IN.
 WHAT TIME IS IT ALL GOING TO
 START IN BETWEEN FOUR
 AND FIVE FOR THE WINCHESTER AND
 THE MARTINSBURG
 AREA.
 ALL THE AREAS IN BLUE.
 BETWEEN SIX AND 7:00 A.M.
 BETWEEN EASTON AREA.
 LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU WILL
 SEE.
 AROUND THIS TIME TOMORROW SOME
 MODERATE TO HEAVY
 SNOW WILL BE FALLING AT THIS
 POINT.
 BY THE AFTERNOON, WE START TO
 SEE THE WARMER AIR
 COME IN.
 THAT'S WHEN IT GETS
 COMPLICATED.
 WE WILL SEE A MIX CHANGE OVER
 TO MOSTLY RAIN IN DC,
 ANDREWS, BY TOMORROW EVENING'S
 COMMUTE.
 WHEN YOU ARE ALONG THE LEESBURG
 AND FREDERICK AREA
 THAT WILL HANG LONGER, CAUSING
 A RISK FOR MORE ICE
 TO FORM.
 WE WOULD BE HAVING FREEZING
 RAIN AND SLEET AND THAT
 FREEZING RAIN COULD CAUSE
 PROBLEMS ACCUMULATING
 ENTREES AND POWER LINES WHICH
 COULD ALSO LEAD TO
 POWER OUTAGES.
 HERE IS HOW MUCH ICE WE COULD
 SEE.
 UP TO A TENTH OF AN INCH AND
 TWO TENTHS OF AN INCH
 ALONG LEESBURG.
 WE HAVE A WINTER STORM WARNING
 IN EFFECT FOR THE DC
 METRO AREA STARTING AROUND 1:00
 A.M.
 ENDING AT
 7:00 TOMORROW EVENING.
 COME UP IN THE NEXT UPDATE IN
 ABOUT 20 MINUTES WE
 WILL GO THROUGH THE STORM, GO
 THROUGH EVERY COUNTY
 TO LET YOU KNOW WHAT YOU CAN
 EXPECT.
  WE WILL BE HERE EARLY
 TOMORROW TO TRACK THIS FOR
 YOU.
 WAKE UP WASHINGTON STARTS AT
 4:00 A.M.

 MILLION IN PROJECTS.
 PROJECTS AT JOINT BASE ANDREWS.
 THAT'S WHY MONDAY NIGHT BOTH
 STATES SIGNED ONTO BE
 PART OF A 16 STATE LAWSUIT.
  THE LAWSUIT WAS FILED ON
 THE BASIS THAT THE
 SITUATION AT THE BORDER IS NOT
 AN EMERGENCY.
 THIS IS WHAT THE COURTS WILL
 HAVE TO DEFINE.
 THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL
 IS EXPECTED TO LEAVE
 THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IN
 MIDMARCH.
 HISTHE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL
 SAID IN JANUARY THAT HE
 WOULD LEAVE SHORTLY AFTER A NEW
 ATTORNEY GENERAL WAS
 IN PLACE AND LAST WEEK WILLIAM
 BARR WAS CONFIRMED AS
 THE NEW ATTORNEY GENERAL BY THE
 SENATE.
 THE VIRGINIA GOVERNOR IS
 SET TO MAKE HIS FIRST
 APPEARANCE RELATED TO HIS BLACK
 FACE SCANDAL.
 A PICTURE OF A PERSON IN BLACK
 FACE AND ANOTHER
 PERSON WEARING A KKK OUTFIT

 BOOK.
 HE SAID IT WASN'T HIM IN THE
 PHOTOGRAPH BUT DID
 ADMIT TO WEARING BLACK FACE IN
 THE PAST.

 PAY RAISE.
 A NEW BILL ALLOWS FOR CHARTER
 SCHOOLS TO HELP
 PARENTS PAY FOR PRIVATE
 SCHOOLS.
 BACK TO YOU.
  THANK YOU.
 THE 38th SEASON OF SURVIVOR
 STARTS TOMORROW.
  THIS SEASON ONCE SOMEONE IS
 VOTED OFF THEY HAVE
 A CHANCE TO RETURN AND THEY
 DON'T EVEN KNOW IT.
 IT TESTS THEM ON HOW FAR THEY
 WILL GO TO PLAY THE
 GAME.
  THERE ARE TWO LOCAL
 CONTESTANTS FROM THE AREA
 AND WE HAVE A PEEK OF ONE RIGHT
 NOW.
  WHAT MAKES ME UNIQUE
 I WAS AT A WEDDING ONCE WITH
 FIVE OTHER PEOPLE WITH
 MY NAME.
 YOU KNOW WHAT -- I TEND TO
 TRUST PEOPLE.
 I DON'T TEND -- TAKE THAT BACK.
 I REALLY DON'T TRUST ANYONE.
 IF YOU GO IN WITH LIKE ALL THE
 STRATEGY YOU ARE OUT.
 PEOPLE SEE THAT.
 THEY KNOW THAT.
 YOU CAN'T GO IN LIKE THAT.
 YOU CAN'T GO IN SEARCHING FOR
 AN IDOL BECAUSE YOU
 ARE OUT.
 YOU CAN'T GO IN SAYING I'M THE
 MASTERMIND.
 MY STRATEGY IS DON'T GET VOTED
 OUT.
  I LOVE HER AND ONE OF THE
 REASONS I LIKE HERE IS
 SHE IS OLD ENOUGH TO NOT CARE
 WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT
 HER BUT SHE DOESN'T HAVE AN
 EDGE BECAUSE OF IT.
 SHE JUST DOESN'T CARE.
  SOME OF MY NOTES TO SELF.
 WALK AWAY, DON'T SAY IT, GIVE
 IT A MINUTE.
 PATIENCE IS A GIFT.
 I HAVE NOT BEEN HONORED WITH
 THAT GIFT.
  JOIN
  I LOVE WATCHING THAT.
  CORRECT.
  TAKE YOU BACK TO ALL THE
 FUN AND EXCITEMENT YOU
 HAD.
  YOU KNOW WHAT
 THERE'S NO REASON TO TRY TO ACT
 LIKE SOMETHING YOU
 AREN'T.
 THAT'S ME.
 THERE YOU HAVE IT.
  YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE
 SAY YOU HAVE A LOT
 GOING FOR YOURSELF.
 YOU LIVE IN A GREAT AREA, YOU
 HAVE KIDS, AND A GOOD
 JOB IN SALES.
 WHY DO YOU WANT TO GO ON THIS
 SHOW
  IT'S A -- I GUESS IT WAS
 LIKE A BUCKET LIST.
 YOU SIT THERE AND YOU TALK ON
 THE COUCH WITH YOUR
 SPOUSE OR WHOEVER YOU ARE
 WATCHING IT WITH AND ARE
 LIKE WHAT ARE THEY DOING
 I COULD DO THAT.
 I WOULD HAVE DONE THAT.
 WHY DID HE SAY THAT
 YOU CAN TALK ABOUT HOW GREAT
 YOU ARE OR YOU CAN
 ACTUALLY APPLY.
 IT WAS A PERFECT TIME.
 I WAS ON A MOTHER'S DAY WEEKEND
 WITH SOME OF MY BEST
 FRIENDS.
 I WAS DRIVING AND I -- I TOLD
 MY BEST FRIEND.
 I'M LIKE ROLL TAPE.
 LET'S GO.
 IT WAS CRAZY.
 I DIDN'T EXPECT WHAT WAS COMING
 OUT OF MY MOUTH.
 IT WAS A LIKE A RANGE OF
 EMOTIONS AND WE SUBMITTED
 TO THE TAPE TO THE WRONG
 WEBSITE.
 IT WAS.
  LIKE THE AMAZING RACE
  THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT,
 IF YOU ARE TED I'M
 IN.
 IT WAS JUST COME TO -- LIKE HOW
 YOU GET SCHOOL
 FOOLED BY SUBMIT HERE AND IT
 WAS A TALENT AGENCY.
 THEY DID CALL WHICH WAS GREAT
 BUT THEY WANTED LIKE
 $500 AND HEAD SHOTS AND I'M
 LIKE NOPE.
 THEN THEY CALLED AND IT WAS
 GREAT.
  WAS IT EVERYTHING YOU
 IMAGINED
 YOU SIT THERE AND I CAN DO THAT
 BETTER.
 WHEN YOU GET THERE IN IT WHAT
 WAS SOME OF THE
 BIGGEST SURPRIS
  IT'S REAL.
 IF MY -- I COULDN'T SAY
 ANYTHING BUT REALITY TV IS
 FAKE, SURVIVOR ISN'T REAL.
 IT'S REAL.
  IT'S REAL.
 YEAH.
 YOU KNOW WHAT YOU KIND OF
 FORGET EVERYTHING THAT YOU
 SAID WHEN YOU ARE ON THE COUCH,
 WHEN YOU ARE IN THE
 GAME.
 IF SOMEONE IS -- GOING TO GET
 ON YOUR NERVES,
 SOMEONE IS GOING TO GET ON YOUR
 NERVES.
 YOU TRY TO BE QUIET BUT THINGS
 HAPPEN.
 IT'S REALITY TV.
  THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR.
 A LOT OF US ARE INVESTED WHO
 HAVE BEEN WATCHING ALL
 38 AND SEASONS.
 WE HAVE A LITTLE SOUND OF IT.
  SHE HAS THAT LACK OF
 CONCERN ABOUT HOW YOU SEE
 HER.
 I LOVE HER.
 ONE OF THE REASONS I LIKE HER
 IS THAT SHE IS OLD
 ENOUGH TO NOT CARE WHAT YOU
 THINK ABOUT HER BUT SHE
 DOESN'T HAVE AN EDGE BECAUSE OF
 IT.
 SHE JUST DOESN'T CARE.
 I'M ME AND I WILL BE ME AND IF
 YOU LIKE IT I WILL
 GET ALONG AND IF YOU DON'T I
 WILL TRY TO VOTE YOU
 OFF, NO BIG DEAL.
  NO BIG DEAL.
  THAT'S TRUE.
 YOU KNOW WHAT
 I HOPE EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD
 HAS THAT ATTITUDE.
 WHY SHOULD YOU CARE WHAT
 SOMEONE ELSE THINKS ABOUT
 YOU
 IF YOU ARE PROUD OF YOURSELF
 AND YOU CARRY YOURSELF
 IN A WAY THAT'S KIND TO OTHERS,
 WHO CARES WHAT
 ANYONE THINKS
 I HOPE THAT MY KIDS FEEL THAT
 WAY.
 I NEVER WANT THEM TO LIVE A
 LIFE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT
 EVERYBODY ELSE HAS TO SAY ABOUT
 THEM.
  THE STRESS ISN'T WORTH IT.
 IT'S A WASTE OF TIME TO THINK.
 YOU ARE MOM TO THREE TEENAGERS.
 WHAT DID THE KIDS THINK
  THAT'S WHAT MADE THIS SO
 EASY.
 THEY ARE SO RIDICULOUSLY
 SUPPORTIVE AND SO SWEET.
 I FEEL BAD ALMOST WHEN I READ
 EVERYBODY'S BIO AND
 THEY ARE LIKE -- PICTURE MY
 FAMILY AND I'M LIKE I
 DON'T HAVE DEMENTIA.
 I WANT A HOODIE.
 I WANT PANTS.
 I WANT TO BE COVERED UP.
 I DON'T WANT BUG BITES.
  YOU JUST WANT A BLANKET.
  NO, I DON'T WANT THAT.
 I WANT TO BE COVERED UP HEAD TO
 TOE AND I DON'T WANT
 TO MISS ANYONE BECAUSE I KNOW
 THEY ARE OKAY.
 WE ARE GOOD.

  I WANT TO READ YOUR PET
 PEEVE IS E. HUMMING,
 INTOLERANCE, SLOBS.
 ON AN ISLAND WITH NO TOILET
 TISSUE HOW DO YOU DEAL
 WITH ALL THAT
  IT IS WHAT IT IS.
 I DON'T LIKE INTOLERANCE.
 IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE RUDE.
 IF YOU ARE GOING TO SAY
 SOMETHING THAT'S NOT
 APPROPRIATE I'M GOING TO SAY
 SOMETHING BECAUSE I
 DON'T LIKE WHAT YOU JUST SAID.
 THAT'S NOT COOL.
 IF I DON'T SAY IT TO YOUR FACE
 NOW I WILL BE SURE TO
 LET YOU KNOW BEFORE WE ARE DONE
 AND OVER WITH.
 WHAT YOU SAID WAS NOT OKAY.
 I DON'T LIKE THAT.
 WHY SHOULD ANYONE BE INTOLERANT
 NOSE PICKING
 DON'T DO IT IN FRONT OF ME.
  YOU ARE GOING TO BE FUN TO
 WATCH.
  CONGRATULATIONS.
  SO GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE.
 SURVIVOR PREMIERES TOMORROW AT
 8:00 RIGHT HERE ON
 WUSA9.
 ALL RIGHT.
 WE WILL BE BACK WITH MORE AFTER
 THIS.
  THANK YOU.
 UP NEXT A YOUNG NORTHERN ER
 TRAVELS TO THE
 WELCOME BACK.
 A CURRENTA YOUNG GIRL TRAVELS
 TO THE SOUTH FOR THE FIRST TIME
 TO EXPLORE THE CIVIL RIGHTS
 TRAIL.
  WHAT SHE FOUND REVEALS
 TRUTH ABOUT HER FAMILY
 HISTORY AND THE NATION'S
 PAINFUL PAST IN REGARD TO
 RACIAL RELATIONS.
 LYNN IS THE WRITER BEHIND THE
 ARTICLE AND IS HERE
 NOW WITH MORE.
 WELCOME TO GREAT DAY.
  THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
 GREAT TO BE HERE.
  IT'S FASCINATING THAT
 NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC
 DECIDES TO VENTURE WITH IN OUR
 COUNTRY.
 WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE TO GO TO
 THE SOUTH AND DOCUMENT
 YOUR EXPERIENCE
  I'M FROM BROOKLYN NEW YORK.
 I HAVEN'T SPENT MUCH TIME IN
 THE SOUTH.
 GOING TO THE DEEP SOUTH FELT
 LIKE A TRIP INTO MY
 FAMILY'S HISTORY.
 I WANTED TO CONNECT TO BLACK
 CULTURE WITH FOOD AND
 HISTORY AND I WANTED TO
 EXPERIENCE IT ON THE GROUND.
 ALSO BECAUSE I'M FROM BROOKLYN
 I CAN'T DRIVE.
 I BROUGHT MY DAD ALONG.
 IT BECAME THIS REALLY AMAZING
 FATHER, DAUGHTER ROAD
 TRIP WHICH MADE IT EVEN MORE
 SPECIAL.
  YOU WENT ALONG THE UNITED
 STATES CIVIL RIGHTS
 TRAIL.
 WAS THAT A GOOD WAY TO EXPLORE
 WHAT -- I THINK
 THAT'S FAIRLY NEW.
  YEAH.
 THE UNITED STATES CIVIL RIGHTS
 TRAIL IS GROWING AND
 EXPANDING AS THE DAYS GO ON.
 IT'S A -- IT'S A NATIONWIDE
 TRAIL THAT INCLUDES A
 LOT OF DIFFERENT, IMPORTANT
 SITES.
 THERE'S THE CHURCHES WHERE --
 ACTIVISTS WENT AND
 ARGUED TO MARCH FROM SELMA TO
 MONTGOMERY.
 WHERE MARTIN LUTHER KING
 MINISTERED OVER THOSE
 CHURCHES ARE ON THE TRAIL.
 THE WAYS THAT -- PLACE THAT YOU
 WOULDN'T EXPECT,
 MAYBE A RESTAURANT WHERE PEOPLE
 TOOK MEETINGS COULD
 BY ON THE TRAIL.
 PLACES WHERE HISTORY WAS
 ACTIVELY MADE.
 YOU CAN EXPERIENCE THAT ALL
 THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.
 I SPECIFICALLY PICKED ALABAMA
 BECAUSE IT'S SORT OF
 THE HOT BED OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS
 MOVEMENT.
 YOU KNOW BIRMINGHAM WAS CALLED
 BOMBINGHAM BECAUSE OF
 ALL OF THE BOMBS SET OFF THERE.
 THERE'S A LOT OF PAINFUL
 HISTORY IN ALABAMA THAT
 SPARKED A LOT OF THE CHANGE IN
 THE COUNTRY.
 I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO
 GO THERE.
  YOU LEARNED ABOUT YOUR
 FAMILY HISTORY AND NOT
 HAVING EVER VENTURED THROUGH
 ALABAMA, THINGS WERE
 FAMILIAR TO YOU.
 IN WHAT WAY
  BEING FROM THE NORTH ITS
 INTERESTING.
 BEING FROM NEW YORK CITY.
 I WOULD SAY THAT THE BLACK
 EXPERIENCE THERE IS VERY
 DIFFERENT.
 MY FRIENDS WERE FIRST
 GENERATION FROM WEST AFRICA.
 I HAD ALL OF THESE INTERACTIONS
 WITH A LOT OF
 DIFFERENT PARTS OF BLACKNESS.
 SPECIFICALLY LIKE BLACK
 AMERICAN IDENTITY.
 I FELT LIKE THAT WAS RICH AND
 TRUE IN THE SOUTH.
 THERE WERE THINGS LIKE I WOULD
 GO -- MY FAMILY IS
 FROM DC.
 ON HOLIDAYS I'M EATING LIKE
 COLLARED GREENS AND MAC
 AND CHEESE AND I KNOW TO PUT A
 LITTLE V.INEGAR ON MY
 GREENS.
 THESE LITTLE CULTURAL THINGS.
  YOU MENTIONED THE FRIED
 FISH SANDWHICH AND I
 RELATED BECAUSE MY FAMILY IS
 FROM ALABAMA AND THERE
 ARE WAYS WE EAT AND HOW WE
 DRESS OUR FOOD THAT IS
 CULTURAL AND YOU DON'T
 NECESSARILY PINPOINT IT.
  I WOULD WATCH HOW WOMEN
 WOULD USE THEIR HANDS
 AND IT WOULD REMIND ME OF WOMEN
 IN MY OWN FAMILY AND
 IT FELT BEAUTIFUL TO BE ABLE TO
 ANCHOR THESE
 EXPERIENCES IN A LARGER
 FRAMEWORK.
 I FELT SO MUCH RECOGNITION
 DURING THAT TRIP.
 WE WERE FOLLOWING -- IN SOME
 WAYS THE GREEN BOOK.
 THE GREEN GUIDE.
 STOPPING BY SOME OF THESE
 RESTAURANTS THAT ARE NO
 LONGER THERE BUT I STARTED TO
 THINK ABOUT WHAT IT
 WOULD FEEL LIKE TO BE TRAVELING
 DURING THE CIVIL
 RIGHTS ERA WHERE IT WOULD HAVE
 BEEN UNSAFE TO BE ON
 THE ROAD AND THAT WAS STRIKING
 WHILE THINKING ABOUT
 BEING IN THE CAR THAT IF WE DID
 THIS DECADES AGO IT
 WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THE SAME.
 I WAS VERY AWARE OF WHERE I
 FELT SAFE, WHERE I FELT
 SEEN, WHERE I FELT -- LIKE I
 COULD RECOGNIZE MYSELF
 IN OTHER PEOPLE.
 IT HAPPENED THROUGHOUT THE
 WHOLE EXPERIENCE.
 IT WAS REALLIY AFFIRMING.
  THANK YOU FOR SHARING THE
 STORY WITH US.
  I'M SO EXCITED TO SHARE
 THIS WITH PEOPLE AT
 HOME.
 IF YOU WANT TO READ THE FULL
 STORY OF HER EYE
 OPENING ROAD TRIP ALONG THE
 CIVIL RIGHTS TRAIL IT'S
 IN THE CURRENT ISSUE OF
 NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC
 TRAVELER.
 GO PICK IT UP.
 HEAR ABOUT THE PLANS FOR A
 NEW MEGA HOSPITAL
 THAT WILL IMPR
 This is not a bed.
 It's a revolution in sleep.

       from $899, during the   Ultimate Sleep Number Event.

           Ends Sunday.
           Sleep Number.      Proven, quality sleep.
 A MAJOR NEW HOSPITAL CENTER
 THAT'S UNDER
 CONSTRUCTION RIGHT NOW WILL
 CHANGE THE FACE  OF
 MEDICAL CARE.
  WE ARE JOINED BY THE SENIOR
 VICE PRESIDENT AND
 CHIEF MEDICAL DOCTOR.
 WELCOME AND CONGRATULATIONS.
 THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE,
 FACILITY.
  THANK YOU.
 THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
  WHAT CAN WE EXPECT
 I KNOW IT'S STILL IN
 CONSTRUCTION.
 YOU ARE IN CHARGE.
 WHAT IS YOUR GOAL AND YOUR
 VISION FOR THIS FACILITY
  NOT ONLY IS THE
 CONSTRUCTION HAPPENING BUT WE
 ARE ON TIME.
  NICE.
  WITH THE CONSTRUCTION.
 FOR THOSE WHO MAY BE PASSING
 THROUGH WE ARE VISIBLE
 FROM THE BELTWAY.
 PLEASE TAKE A LOOK.
 WE ARE ABOUT EIGHT OR NINE
 STORIES OUT OF THE GROUND
 AND VERY PROUD OF THE PROGRESS
 THAT'S BEING MADE.
  YOU SEE THE MAP ON THE
 SCREEN HERE.
 YOU HAVE A COMMUNITY DRIVEN
 MISSION WITH THIS NEW
 FACILITY.
 TELL US ABOUT THAT.
  ABSOLUTELY..
 WE RECOGNIZE THAT HEALTH CARE
 IN ANY COMMUNITY IS
 BIGGER THAN JUST THE HOSPITAL.
 OUR HEALTH SYSTEM.
 THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND
 HEALTH SYSTEM IS ONE THAT
 IS ANCHORED BY A NEW HOSPITAL
 WHICH WILL BE IN
 LARGO.
 WE ALSO HAVE TWO OTHER
 FACILITIES WHICH PROVIDE
 SERVICES FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES
 AND ARE LINKED TO THE
 FLAG SHIP HOSPITAL WHICH WILL
 BE THE UNIVERSITY OF
 MARYLAND, REGION MEDICAL
 CENTER.
  WHAT THEY LOVE SO MUCH.
 WE WERE JUST CHATTING ABOUT
 UNIVERSITY OF MEDICAL
 SYSTEM.
 BEING IN THIS AREA IS HAVING
 ACCESS TO THOSE DOCTORS
 MEANS YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THE
 WHOLE SYSTEM.
 THESE DOCTORS TALK TO EACH
 OTHER.
 THEY ARE ALWAYS MEETING EVERY
 WEEK.
 YOUR CASE, YOUR SITUATION, YOUR
 ISSUE WILL BE SEEN
 BY SOME OF THE BEST DOCTORS IN
 THE NATION.
  YES.
 I'M GLAD YOU MENTIONED THAT.
 THE ASSOCIATION WITH THE
 UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND
 MEDICAL SYSTEM WHICH HAPPENED
 IN SEPTEMBER OF 2017
 BRINGS ACCESS TO A WHOLE RANGE
 OF SPECIALISTS AND
 FACULTY.
 AS A RESULT WE NOW HAVE THREE
 GROUPS OF DOCTORS WHO
 SUPPORT THE HEALTH SYSTEM, THE
 DOCTORS WHO HAVE BEEN
 A PART OF THE COMMUNITY AND A
 PART OF THE HOSPITAL
 CENTER FOR A LONG TIME.
 THE NEW DOCTORS WHO ARE PART OF
 THE UNIVERSITY EVER
 MARYLAND MEDICAL SCHOOL WHO
 HAVE BEEN ON THE GROUND
 AND RUNNING SEVERAL OF THE KEY
 SERVICES FOR SEVERAL
 YEARS NOW.
 ALSO, WE ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT
 THE NEW DOCTORS WHO
 WE ARE ABLE TO NOW RECRUIT
 THROUGH THIS VERY
 EXCITING PROJECT AND WHO ARE
 EXCITED TO COME ON
 BOARD  WITH US.
 THAT COOPERATION ACROSS
 DOCTORS, ACADEMIC AND THOSE
 WHO WE WILL HIRE IS CRITICALLY
 IMPORTANT.
  I WANT TO COMMEND YOU ON
 YOUR CONSCIOUS
 LEADERSHIP WHEN YOU ARE
 THINKING ABOUT THE EXISTING
 DOCTORS WHO ARE IN THE COUNTY.
 YOU ARE BRINGING IN ALL OF THE
 NEW DOCTORS AND YOU
 HAVE THIS AMAZING FACILITY.
 TELL US ABOUT THE SERVICE THAT
 WILL BE OFFERED AND
 THE FEATURES, SOME OF THEM YOU
 SEE ON THE SCREEN
 THAT PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO
 RECEIVE AND IMPROVE
 THEIR HEALTH STATUS RIGHT IN
 THE COMMUNITY WHERE
 THEY LIVE.
  AGAIN, THIS IS GOING BE A
 STATE-OF-THE-ART,
 600,000 SQUARE FOOT FACILITY
 LOCATED IN LARGO.
 IT'LL BE A 205 BED FACILITY.
 A TRAUMA CENTER.
 ALSO, THE COUNTY'S ONLY
 NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE
 UNIT.
 ALSO A VERY HIGHLY RECOGNIZED
 CARDIAC SURGERY
 PROGRAM WHICH I THINK YOU HAVE
 HEARD ABOUT AS WELL
 AS A STROKE PROGRAM.
 THE REASON THAT IT'S IMPORTANT
 FOR THE FLAG SHIP
 FACILITY TO CONTINUE THESE
 SERVICES FOR THE COUNTY
 AND THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES
 IS THAT THE DISEASE
 BURDEN THAT WE ALL KNOW WELL
 HAS BEEN AFFECTING THE
 RESIDENTS OF THE COUNTY AND
 SURROUNDING COUNTIES.
 HAVEN'T BEEN PROPERLY ADDRESSED
 ON A POPULATION
 BASIS.
 NOW WITH A -- A NOT ONLY A NEW
 FACILITY WHICH WITH
 THESE HIGH END SERVICES BUT
 ALSO A NETWORK OF OTHER
 PARTS OF OUR HEALTH SYSTEM.
 ALSO A NUMBER OF
 PRACTICES, COMMUNITY PRACTICES
 WHERE OUR RESIDENTS
 CAN RECEIVE SERVICES OUTSIDE
 THE HOSPITAL AND IT'S
 REALLY IMPORTANT THAT ALL OF
 THOSE ARE CONNECTED AND
 THAT IS WHAT I DO EVERY DAY
 ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUES
 AND WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE
 PROSPECT.
  AND THIS IS YOUR
 NEIGHBORHOOD.
 YOU GET TO WORK THREE MILES
 FROM HOME NOW.
 THIS IS GREAT.
 CONGRATULATIONS ON ALL OF THE
 INCREDIBLE STUFF YOU
 ARE BRINGING TO THE COUNTY.
 I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE
 FINISHED PROJECT.
 THANK YOU.
  THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE
 TO THE COMMUNITY.

 WEATHER.
 UP TO SIX INCHES OF
 WE ARE BRACING FOR WINTER
 WEATHER.
 TOMORROW AROUND THIS TIME WE
 WILL GET MODERATE TO
 HEAVY SNOW.
 HERE IS HOW MUCH WE EXPECT AND
 THE TIME IT'LL START.
 EVERYWHERE IN THIS WHITE COLOR.
 THREE TO SIX INCHES ACROSS DC
 METRO.
 THAT INCLUDES ANDREWS, COLLEGE
 PARK, SILVER SPRINGS,
 FAIRFAX,   FALLS CHURCH.
 HIGHER AMOUNTS OF SLEET AND
 SNOW COMBINES, SIX TO
 EIGHT INCHES ALONG WESTMINISTER
 AND THESE AREAS WILL
 START EARLIER AND BE A BIT
 HEAVIER AT TIMES.
 THE LOWER AMOUNTS ONE TO THREE
 INCHES.
 THOSE AREAS WE ARE THINKING
 THAT IS -- WE WILL SEE A
 TRANSITION TO RAIN AND FREEZING
 RAIN AND SLEET A
 LITTLE EARLIER IN THOSE SPOTS.
 START TIME, 4:00 A.M.
 TO 5:00 A.M.
 ALONG WINCHESTER
 AND MARTINSBURG. THEN ROUGHLY
 SIX TO SEVEN AS YOU HEAD ALONG
 THE
 EASTERN SHORE.
 HERE ARE THE MAIN THREATS.
 WE WILL HAVE THAT CHANCE TO GET
 SOME HEAVY SNOW
 AROUND HERE, SOME SHOWERS AND A
 MIX OF WINTER
 WEATHER WHICH ALSO INCLUDES
 SLEET AND FREEZING RAIN
 THAT WILL LEAD TO ICING IN A
 FEW SPOTS.
 SO, HOUR BY HOUR THIS IS WHAT
 IT LOOKS LIKE
 TOMORROW.
 5:00 A.M.
 WINCHESTER, LEESBURG GETTING
 SNOW.
 AT 6:30 A.M.
 THE SNOW ACROSS FREDRICKBU RG.
 BY THE 7:00 A.M.
 HOUR MOST AREAS ARE GETTING
 LIGHT
 TO MODERATE SNOW.
 WE WILL DEAL WITH THAT HEAVIER
 SNOW AROUND THE AREA.
 YOU HAVE THE TEMPERATURES CLOSE
 TO THE FREEZING MARK
 IT.
 GIVES YOU THAT WET, HEAVIER
 TYPE OF SNOW.
 WE WILL START TO SEE A
 TRANSITION FROM A MIX OVER TO
 RAIN.
 YOU WILL SEE THAT FIRST AROUND
 FREDRICKSBURG.
 WE HAVE A WINTER MIX GOING ON,
 A WINTER MESS WITH
 THE FREEZING RAIN AND SLEET AND
 THEN BY 430 ACTION
 IN THE AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES
 COME ABOVE FREEZING
 AND WE WILL SEE THAT TRANSITION
 OVER TO RAIN.
 UNLESS YOU ARE IN THE NORTHERN
 SUBURBS, ONLY ADDING
 TO THE POTENTIAL FOR ICE
 ACCUMULATION.
 TWO TENTHS OF AN INCH POSSIBLE
 ALLOWANCE LEESBURG.
 OUR NORTHERN SUBURBS COULD SEE
 A LITTLE MORE ICE
 FORMING AND THAT'S A PROBLEM.
 YOU HAVE SEVERAL INCHES OF SNOW
 AND WILL PUT ICE ON
 TOP OF IT.
 IT'S LIKE THE ONE, TWO PUNCH OF
 WINTER WEATHER THAT
 WE WILL BE SEEING.
 THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE
 TAKING THE STORM
 SERIOUSLY.
 ISSUING A WINTER STORM WARNING.
 WE WILL START AT 1:00 WEDNESDAY
 MORNING AND LAST
 UNTIL 7:00 WEDNESDAY EVENING.
 THE SEVEN DAY FORECAST YOU WILL
 NOTICE TEMPERATURES
 IN THE 40'S.
 SNOW AND A MIX CHANGING OVER TO
 RAIN.
 ONCE WE GET PAST WEDNESDAY
 MOTHER NATURE MAKING UP
 TO US.
 RAIN CHANCES BUT TEMPERATURES
 WILL HEAD TO THE 50'S
 AND 60'S BY SUNDAY.
 TODAY IN THE GREAT DAY
 KITCHEN WE ARE FOCUSING
 ON HEART HEALTHY SEAFOOD
 SPECIALITIES WITH THE
 EXECUTIVE CHEF OF OCEAN AIR.
 WELCOME BACK.
  THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
  LOVE ALL THE BEAUTY HERE.
 I THINK IT'S GOOD TO REMIND
 PEOPLE THAT THE FISH AND
 SEAFOOD IS GOOD FOR YOUR HEART.
  THEY ARE VISIBLE IN ALL OF
 THESE FOODS I HAVE
 HERE.
 OMEGA3 IN THAT.
 WE HAVE ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT
 SEAFOOD.
 MARYLAND ROCK FISH.
 A NICE LOCAL FAVORITE AS WELL.
  WHEN -- LET ME ASK YOU
 ABOUT THE OYSTERS.
 NOT TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT.
 RAW -- WHEN YOU COOK THEM OR --
 DO -- WHAT IS IT
 DO YOU LOOSE ANY OF THE
 NUTRIENTS
  THEY ARE STILL RIGHT IN
 THERE.
 ANYTHING YOU ADD IS JUST A
 BONUS FOR THE FLAVOR.
  IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE RAW
 ONES YOU CAN TRY IT IS
 OTHER WAY.
 SALMON.
 WE KNOW THAT'S GOOD FOR YOU.
 WHAT ARE YOU MAKING FOR US
  THIS PREPARATION MEANS IN
 PAPER.
 THIS IS A GREAT PREPARATION TO
 GO AT HOME.
 LITTLE CLEAN UP AND IT'S EASY
 TO DO.
 I PUT VEGETABLES DOWN HERE.
  THOSE ARE RAW.
  RAW.
 ALL THE STUFF IS RAW GOING INTO
 THE PAPER AND THEN
 INTO THE OVEN.
 YOU PUT A LITTLE BIT OF
 SEASONING ON TOP OF THAT AND
 THEN AROMATICS.
 YOU CAN SEASON IT HOW YOU WANT.
 YOU CAN PUT CITRUS, GARLIC,
 LEMON JUICE, CHERRY
 TOMATOES.
 YOU CAN JUST FOLD THE PAPER
 AROUND THE SALMON.
 IT CREATES A NICE STEAM POCKET.
 WHEN YOU DO THAT YOU JUST PULL
 IT AROUND THERE AND
 YOU FOLD IT UP.
 YOU WANT TO CREATE AS TIGHT A
 SEAL AS POSSIBLE TO
 PUT THE SEAM IN THERE.
 WHAT YOU WILL HAVE IS THIS
 CIRCLE OF PARCHMENT
 PAPER.
 YOU DON'T WANT ANYTHING WITH
 WAX BECAUSE YOU ARE
 STEAMING.
 THEN YOU WILL JUST FINISH
 FOLDING IT LIKE THAT.
 THEN PUT IT INTO A 425-DEGREE
 OVEN FOR ABOUT 20
 MINUTES AND YOU WILL GET
 SOMETHING THAT COMES OUT
 SIMILAR TO THIS.
 THIS IS PREPARED.
 JUST SEE A LITTLE.
  LIKE A SALMON BURRITO.
 ALL GOOD FOR YOU.
  FRESH THYME AND THE LEMON
 WEDGES IN THERE FLAVOR
 IT UP VERY NICELY.
  LOOK AT THE STEAM COMING
 OUT.
  THIS IS ALWAYS ONE YOU CAN
 HAVE WITH PARTIES AND
 STUFF.
 YOU CAN PREPARE IT AHEAD OF
 TIME.
 GREAT TO HAVE WITH FAMILY AND
 STUFF.
 ANOTHER WAY I LIKE TO FLAVOR
 THINGS IS WITH VINEGAR
 AND STUFF.
 IT'S A LOW FAT WAY OF  ADDING
 FLAVOR TO A FISH.
 THERE'S ALL KINDS OF FISH.
 IF YOU LIKE SARDIN ES THIS IS
 JUST A SIMPLE
 VINEGRETTE.
 LITTLE BIT OF FRESH THYME.

         It hasn't always        been easy, has it?

       There have been days    when you doubted yourself.

        And days when you       were ready to quit.

         But you didn't.

  Because you had the courage to venture into something powerful.
            Education.
     If I leave you with just      three words of advice:
     never...stop...growing.
            [cheering]
 CURRENTLY IT'S ESTIMATED
 THAT HALF THE
 POPULATION OF THE UNITED STATES
 HAS DIABETES OR HAS
 PREDIABETES.
 THE STATS AREN'T SLOWING DOWN
 EVEN WITH ALMOST
 DIFFERENT 50 DIABETES
 MEDICATIONS ON THE MARKET.
 ACCORDING TO AARP, 65-YEAR-
 OLD'S IN THE COUNTRY ARE
 TAKING AN AVERAGE OF FIVE
 DIFFERENT MEDICATIONS EACH
 DAY WITH THE AVERAGE FOR ALL
 TYPE 2 BEING NINE PER
 DAY.
 HERE WITH US TODAY ARE DOCTORS
 TOM AND STEPHANIE
 CHENEY OF LIVING HEALTH
 INTEGRATED MEDICATION TO
 SHARE THE DIFFERENT APPROACHES
 TO DIABETES.
 ONE THAT IS HELPING PATIENTS
 REVERSE THEIR
 CONDITION.
 WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW.
  THANK YOU.
  I WANT TO START WITH YOU.
 HOW CAN PEOPLE HAVE SO MANY
 MEDICATIONS AVAILABLE ON
 THE MARKET THAT TREAT DIABETES
 AND THEN THE RATES
 ARE STILL GROWING
  THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.
 MOST PATIENTS COME TO US AND
 THEY ARE UNDER
 CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT.
 THEY ARE GOING TO SEE THEIR
 DOCTOR AND UNFORTUNATELY
 MOST CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT IS
 GEARED TOWARD THE
 MANAGEMENT OF THE SYMPTOMS AND
 TRYING TO SLOW DOWN
 THE PROGRESSION OF THE DISEASE.
 YOU KNOW TREAT THE SYMPTOMS AND
 THE -- THE SIDE
 EFFECTS AND COMPLICATIONS THAT
 COME ALONG WITH IT
 LIKE HEART ATTACKS, STROKE,
 THINGS THAT HAVE REALLY
 ONSET ALZHEIMER'S.
 THERE'S A LOT OF CONDITIONS
 THAT COME ALONG WITH
 PROGRESSION OF THIS DISEASE.
 SO, WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS NOT
 -- BE REACTIVE ABOUT
 TREATING THIS DISEASE.
 WE WANT TO BE PROACTIVE.
 OUR MODEL IS GEARED TOWARD
 ACTUALLY TREATING THE
 ROOT CAUSES OF THE DISEASE.
 SO WE TAKE A FUNCTIONAL
 MEDICINE MODEL AND WHAT WE
 SEE IS THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT
 CAUSES OF THIS
 DISEASE.
 WE GO AFTER THE CAUSES AND THEN
 WE ARE ABLE TO SEE
 THAT OVERTIME THE DISEASE CAN
 BE REVERSED.
  OKAY.
 YOU SAY CAUSES WHICH DEBUNKS
 THE IDEA THAT DIABETES
 IS JUST A POOR FUNCTIONING
 PANCREAS.
 THAT'S NOT TRUE
  IT'S A SIMPLE VIEW OF WHAT
 TYPE 2 DIABETES IS.
 TYPE 2 DIABETES FROM OUR
 PERSPECTIVE AND TESTING IS
 RARELY EVEN A PANCREAS.
 IT'S THE STRESS BUT IT'S
 STRESSED BECAUSE IT'S
 DEALING WITH A VERY LARGE OVER
 LOAD OF SUGAR AND A
 VERY CHALLENGING AMOUNT OF
 INSULIN RESISTANCE.
 IT'S NOT THAT IT'S NOT WORKING,
 IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR
 IT TO OVERCOME ALL OF THAT
 SUGAR.
 FOR US IT'S A MATTER OF DOING
 TESTING TO FIGURE OUT
 WHAT ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT
 REASONS WHY THE SUGAR IS
 COMPLETELY OUT OF CONTROL.
 IT'S MORE THAN YOU ATE A BOWL
 OF JELLY BEANS AND
 YOUR SUGAR WENT UP.
 PATIENTS HAVE FIGURED OUT IF
 THEY EAT SUGAR THEIR
 SUGAR GOES HIGH.
 WE SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT
 HAVE TRIED TO CHANGE
 THEIR DIET, THEY STARTED
 EXERCISING, TRYING TO GET
 THE SUGAR DOWN AND IT'S NOT
 WORKING.
 WE DO TESTING, BLOOD, URINE AND
 TRY TO FIGURE OUT IS
 IT A -- UNDER LYING INFECTION,
 OTHER ISSUES LIKE
 FOOD ALLERGIES OR VITAMIN
 PROBLEMS, GLAND
 DISFUNCTION AND THEN WE CAN
 CREATE A CUSTOM PROGRAM
 THAT WILL ACTUALLY HELP THAT
 PERSON GET HEALTHY AND
 FUNCTIONING AND THEN THE
 PANCREAS IS HAPPY AGAIN.
 IT HAS A NORMAL AMOUNT OF
 SUGAR.
  ISN'T THAT WHAT WE ALL WANT
 THERE'S A TEST CALLED HBA1C.
 IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS IS MUCH
 MORE IN DEPTH THAN JUST
 GETTING TESTED EVERY NOW AND
 AGAIN FOR THAT AND IT
 LEADS TO DIABETES ACTUALLY
 BEING REVERSED.
  RIGHT.
 THAT MARKER.
 THE HBA1C IS THE AMOUNT OF RED
 BLOOD CELLS DAMAGED
 BY BLOOD SUGAR.
 IT'S A MARKER THEY LOOK TO
 DETERMINE HOW BAD IS YOUR
 DIABETES.
 HOW POORLY IS IT BEING MANAGED.
 DO YOU NEED ANOTHER MEDICATION
 ALL IT IS A MARKER FOR THE
 DAMAGE CAUSED BY SUGAR.
 IT'S NOT TELLING YOU WHERE IS
 THAT SUGAR COMING
 FROM, WHAT'S THE DAMAGE CAUSED
 BY
 NORMAL IS 5.7% OR BELOW.
 WHEN WE ARE WORKING WITH
 SOMEONE WHO COMES IN AND
 THEY HAVE A 9.2% LIKE THERESA
 WE TALKED TO HAD A
 9.2% ON THREE DIFFERENT
 MEDICATIONS.
 WE WANTED TO GET HER DOWN ON NO
 MEDICATIONS.
 WE GOT HER DOWN LESS THAN TWO
 MONTHS TO LESS THAN

 A REVERSAL IS GETTING IT DOWN
 WHILE THE PATIENT IS
 BEING ABLE TO GET TAKEN OFF
 MEDICATION.
  THIS SOUNDS AMAZING.
 YOU HAVE A PROGRAM WHERE PEOPLE
 CAN TAKE PART AND BE
 LIKE SOME OF YOUR SUCCESS
 STORIES.
 TELL ME MORE ABOUT THE PROGRAM.
  FOR VIEWERS OUT THERE THAT
 WANT TO STOP TREATING
 SYMPTOMS AND TREAT THE CAUSES
 OF THE DISEASE, THAT'S
 WHAT WE DO IN THE PROGRAM.
 IT'S A FUNCTIONAL MEDICINE
 APPROACH.

 SEMINAR.
