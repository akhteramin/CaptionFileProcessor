 THE WHEEL, AN AGGRESSIVE FTC THAT WOULD WANT TO CRACK DOWN ON
 SOME OF THESE THINGS THAT WARREN
 LAID OUT WOULD BE SHOCKING.
 THAT'S THE AMAZING THING
 ABOUT THIS REVISED ANTITRUST
 MOVEMENT.
 THERE'S ALREADY REGULATORY
 BODIES, STATUTORY AUTHORITY IN
 PLACE.
 THE CRAZIEST THING IS IT HAS NOT
 BEEN USE INSTEAD A PARTICULARLY
 AGGRESSIVE YEAR BECAUSE OF A
 REVOLUTION IN THE WAY ALL THIS
 STUFF WAS DONE.
 I THINK THE OTHER THING AS A
 SMALL BUSINESS OWNER, I CAN TELL
 YOU I SEE THIS ALL THE TIME, IS
 YOU SEE WHEN COMPANIES GET BIG
 THE FIRST THING THEY DO IS
 INCREASE THE BARRIERS OF ENTRY
 TO KEEP PEOPLE LIKE ME FROM
 GETTING INTO THE PROCESS.
 AND THE STORY ELIZABETH
 WARREN SAID WHILE AMAZON WILL
 SIT THERE YOUR PLATES LOOK NICE,
 WE'RE SELLING AMAZON PLATES NOW.
 THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING WITH ME
 TONIGHT.
 THAT IS ALL IN FOR THIS
 EVENING.
 THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW STARTS
 NOW.
 JOY IS IN FOR RH.
 RACHEL HAS THE NIGHT OFF.
 SHE WILL BE BACK ON MONDAY.
 HAPPY FRIDAY, EVERYBODY.
 YESTERDAY WE WERE TREATED TO TWO
 RELATED PIECES OF NEWS THAT WERE
 BOTH SHOCKING IN THEIR OWN WAY.
 WE WITNESSED THE SPECTACLE OF
 THE SITTING PRESIDENT'S CAMPAIGN
 CHAIRPERSON BEING SENTENCED TO
 PRISON, THE FIRST TIME IN U.S.
 HISTORY THAT THAT HAS EVER
 HAPPENED.
 THAT IS THING ONE.
 BUT THE SECOND PIECE WAS WHAT
 KIND OF SENTENCE PAUL MANAFORT
 GOT, ONE THAT SHOCKED EVEN
 VETERAN PROSECUTORS BECAUSE PAUL
 MANAFORT'S SENTENCE OF NEARLY
 FOUR YEARS IN PRISON ON EIGHT
 FELONY FINANCIAL FRAUD COUNTS
 WAS FAR LESS THAN THE 19 1/2 TO
 24 YEARS THAT WERE RECOMMENDED
 BY THE FEDERAL SENTENCING
 GUIDELINES FOR HIS CRIMES, FAR
 LESS THAN WE'VE SEEN PEOPLE
 SENTENCED FOR FOR ANYTHING FROM
 MISTAKENLY VOTING IN AN ELECTION
 WITH A PREVIOUS FELONY
 CONVICTION OR BEING CONVICTED
 FOR MARIJUANA POSSESSION.
 FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE WATCHING
 THAT SENTENCE, YESTERDAY FELT
 LIKE AN OBJECT LESSON IN RICH
 MAN'S JUSTICE.
 AND THEN LAST NIGHT, MANAFORT'S
 LAWYER EXITED THE COURTROOM WITH
 A COMPLETE NON-SEQUITER TALKING
 POINT THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO
 WITH WHAT HAPPENED IN THE COURT.
 AS YOU HEARD IN COURT TODAY,
 MR. MANAFORT FINALLY GOT TO
 SPEAK FOR HIMSELF.
 HE MADE CLEAR HE ACCEPTS
 RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS CONDUCT,
 AND I THINK MOST IMPORTANTLY
 WHAT YOU SAW TODAY IS THE SAME
 THING THAT WE HAD SAID FROM DAY
 ONE.
 THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE
 THAT PAUL MANAFORT WAS INVOLVED
 WITH ANY COLLUSION WITH ANY
 GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL FROM RUSSIA.
 THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE
 SENTENCE?
 THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.
 NO COLLUSION.
 WAIT, WAIT, WHAT?
 EVEN THE VERY LENIENT JUDGE WHO
 SAID THAT MANAFORT HAD LED AN
 OTHERWISE EXEMPLARY LIFE,
 BESIDES THE EIGHT MAJOR FELONIES
 THAT ROBBED THE UNITED STATES OF
 TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS,
 EVEN THAT JUDGE SAID EARLY ON IN
 THE TRIAL THAT THE CHARGES
 AGAINST MANAFORT HAD NOTHING TO
 DO WITH RUSSIAN COLLUSION, SO TO
 COME OUT OF THAT TRIAL SAYING
 SEE THAT, NO EVIDENCE OF
 COLLUSION, THAT MAKES ABOUT ZERO
 SENSE.
 AND THEN TODAY AS IF BY
 COINCIDENCE, DONALD TRUMP PICKED
 UP THAT FAMILIAR TALKING POINT
 AND RAN WITH IT.
 VERY POINTEDLY DIRECTING
 REPORTERS TO THOSE COMMENTS FROM
 MANAFORT'S LAWYER.
 TRUMP SAID HE WAS, QUOTE, VERY
 HONORED THAT THE JUDGE IN THE
 CASE HAD DECLARED THAT THERE WAS
 NO COLLUSION IN RUSSIA.
 FIRST OF ALL, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
 THE JUDGE DID NOT SAY THAT
 BECAUSE, AGAIN, THAT'S NOT WHAT
 THE MANAFORT CASE WAS ABOUT, BUT
 TRUMP WAS VERY HONORED BY THOSE
 IMAGINARY WORDS FROM THE JUDGE.
 AND DONALD TRUMP DIDN'T STOP
 THERE.
 HE KEPT ON STEERING THE
 DISCUSSION BACK TO NO COLLUSION,
 AND EVEN BACK TO HIS LONG-TIME
 LAWYER MICHAEL COHEN, EVEN
 THOUGH THERE IS LITERALLY
 NOTHING IN THE COHEN SAGA THAT
 BENEFITS HIM.
 LET'S TALK ABOUT MY OTHER CLOSE
 ASSOCIATE WHO'S HEADED TO PRISON
 SOON, #NOCOLLUSION.
 SO A COUPLE OF THINGS ARE WEIRD
 ABOUT THIS, THERE'S THE FACT
 THAT MANAFORT THROUGH HIS LAWYER
 SEEMED TO BE PARROTING THE TRUMP
 SCRIPT EVEN AS HE PREPARES TO GO
 BEFORE ANOTHER JUDGE FOR A
 SECOND SENTENCING, WITH A JUDGE
 WHO HAS NOW ABSORBED THE MASSIVE
 PUBLIC OUTRAGE ABOUT HOW SHORT A
 SENTENCE HE JUST RECEIVED.
 AND MORE THAN A FEW LEGAL
 OBSERVERS ARE THINKING THE
 REASON HE'S SINGING FROM THE
 TRUMP NO COLLUSION SONG BOOK IS
 PARDONS, SOMETHING TRUMP ALSO
 BROUGHT UP, UNPROMPTED TODAY
 ABOUT MICHAEL COHEN.
 TRUMP TOLD REPORTERS TODAY THAT
 COHEN LIED TO CONGRESS WHEN HE
 SAID THAT HE HAD NEVER SOUGHT A
 PARDON.
 THEN AS SOON AS HE BOARDED HIS
 PLANE FOR ALABAMA TODAY, TRUMP
 TWEETED THAT MICHAEL COHEN HAD
 ASKED HIM DIRECTLY FOR A PARDON,
 AND TRUMP CLAIMED HE SAID NO.
 NOW COHEN SAYS THAT TRUMP IS
 LYING ABOUT THAT BUT REPUBLICAN
 CONGRESSMAN JIM JORDAN SAID HE'S
 GOINGS TO SEND ANOTHER CRIMINAL
 REFERRAL TO THE JUSTICE
 DEPARTMENT OVER COHEN'S ALLEGED
 LIE ABOUT WHETHER HE ASKED FOR A
 PARDON RAISING THE FOLLOW
 INTRIGUING QUESTION.
 WILL DONALD TRUMP HAVE TO BE
 INTERVIEWED AS PART OF AN
 INVESTIGATION INTO MICHAEL
 COHEN'S ALLEGED LYING ABOUT
 TRYING FOR A PARDON?
 I MEAN, IF THEY HAD A ONE ON ONE
 CONVERSATION ABOUT IT AS DONALD
 TRUMP ALLEGES IN HIS TWITTER
 FEED, WOULDN'T TRUMP HAVE TO
 GIVE EVIDENCE?
 ALSO TODAY, WHITE HOUSE
 COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR BILL
 SHINE ABRUPTLY RESIGNED.
 BILL SHINE CAME TO THE WHITE
 HOUSE FROM FOX NEWS, AND HE WILL
 NOW GO TO WORK ON DONALD TRUMP'S
 RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN, PERHAPS
 ONE DAY HE'LL END UP BACK AT FOX
 NEWS.
 AH, YES, IT'S THE CIRCLE OF
 LIFE.
 AND SPEAKING OF WHITE HOUSE
 COMMUNICATIONS, ONE OF THE
 THINGS THAT HAS MADE THIS WHITE
 HOUSE DIFFERENT FROM ALL THE
 OTHER WHITE HOUSES IS THE AMOUNT
 OF LEAKING THAT HAPPENS INSIDE
 IT.
 THIS WHITE HOUSE IS SO LEAKY
 LAST YEAR "AXIOS" PUBLISHED A
 PIECE ENTITLED WHITE HOUSE
 LEAKERS LEAK ABOUT LEAKING, IN
 WHICH SOME OF THE
 ADMINISTRATION'S MOST PROLIFIC
 ANONYMOUS LEAKERS SPOKE TO
 "AXIOS" ANONYMOUSLY ABOUT WHAT
 THEY LEAK AND WHY, AND WHEN IT
 COMES TO WHITE HOUSE LEAKING,
 THERE'S THE PETTY SCORE SETTLING
 KIND.
 THERE'S THE KIND DESIGNED TO
 ADVANCE YOUR PREFERRED POLICY
 POSITION IF YOU'VE LOST SOME
 INTERNAL DEBATE, AND IN THIS
 WHITE HOUSE, THERE'S EVEN
 LEAKING BECAUSE MAYBE YOU THINK
 THE ONLY WAY TO REACH THE
 PRESIDENT IS TO GET SOMETHING
 ONTO THE TV SO THAT HE CAN SEE
 IT DURING HIS EXECUTIVE TIME.
 THERE'S ALSO LEAKING OUT OF
 CONCERN, LEAKING THAT APPEARS TO
 BE UNDERTAKEN TO SOUND THE
 ALARM.
 IT WAS SIX MONTHS AGO THIS WEEK
 THAT WE GOT THE ASTONISHING
 OP-ED IN THE "NEW YORK TIMES" IN
 WHICH AN ANONYMOUS SENIOR TRUMP
 ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL
 DESCRIBED BEING ONE OF A NUMBER
 OF SENIOR ADMINISTRATION
 OFFICIALS, QUOTE, WORKING
 DILIGENTLY FROM WITHIN TO
 FRUSTRATE PARTS OF TRUMP'S
 AGENDA AND HIS WORST
 INCLINATIONS.
 QUOTE, WE BELIEVE OUR FIRST DUTY
 IS TO THIS COUNTRY, AND THE
 PRESIDENT CONTINUES TO ACT IN A
 MANNER THAT IS DETRIMENTAL TO
 THE HEALTH OF OUR REPUBLICAN.
 AMERICANS SHOULD KNOW THAT THERE
 ARE ADULTS IN THE ROOM.
 WE ARE TRYING TO DO WHAT'S
 RIGHT, EVEN WHEN DONALD TRUMP
 WON'T.
 NOW, YOUR MILEAGE MAY VARY AS TO
 WHETHER YOU THOUGHT THAT OP-ED
 WAS COURAGEOUS OR
 SELF-JUSTIFYING, REASSURING OR
 TERRIFYING.
 IT WAS THE KIND OF LEAK FROM
 INSIDE THIS ADMINISTRATION.
 HERE'S SOMETHING I THINK THE
 AMERICAN PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW
 ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.
 THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF OF
 THESE, AT THE BEGINNING OF
 TRUMP'S PRESIDENCY ANONYMOUS
 WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS LEAKED
 DETAILS AND TRANSCRIPTS OF
 TRUMP'S PHONE CALLS WITH FOREIGN
 LEADERS.
 SURE, MAYBE THEY DID THAT TO
 EMBARRASS HIM, BUT IT SEEMED
 THAT SOME PEOPLE INSIDE THIS
 WHITE HOUSE THOUGHT THE PUBLIC
 NEEDED TO KNOW WHAT TRUMP WAS
 SAYING ON THOSE CALLS.
 THERE WAS THE REPORT A FEW
 MONTHS AGO THAT THE PRESIDENT
 WAS CARRYING ON ALL KINDS OF
 SENSITIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH
 FRIENDS ON HIS UNSECURED CELL
 PHONE.
 CONVERSATIONS BEING LISTENED TO
 BY CHINESE AND RUSSIAN
 INTELLIGENCE.
 THAT LEAK CERTAINLY SOUNDS LIKE
 A WARNING OR MAYBE A CRY FOR
 HELP, QUOTE, MR. TRUMP'S AIDES
 HAVE REPEATEDLY WARNED HIM THAT
 HIS CELL PHONE CALLS ARE NOT
 SECURE, AND THEY HAVE TOLD HIM
 THAT RUSSIAN SPIES ARE ROUTINELY
 EAVESDROPPING ON THE CALLS, BUT

 AIDES SAY THE VOLUBLE PRESIDENT
 HAS STILL REFUSED TO GIVE UP HIS
 iPHONES.
 WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS SAY THEY
 CAN ONLY HOPE HE REFRAINS FROM
 DISCUSSING CLASSIFIED
 INFORMATION WHEN HE WAS ON THEM.
 WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET HIM
 TO DO THAT DANGEROUS THING, SO
 WE BETTER ALERT THE PUBLIC ABOUT
 IT THOSE LEAKED SEEMED TO SAY.
 AND THERE HAVE BEEN LEAKS ABOUT
 JARED KUSHNER AND HIS SECURITY
 CLEARANCE, THAT HE HAD AN
 INTERIM CLEARANCE FOR A YEAR
 BECAUSE OFFICIALS WOULD NOT
 CLEAR HIM FOR A PERMANENT ONE.
 AND THEN HIS INTERIM CLEARANCE
 WAS REVOKED, AND THEN THE
 PRESIDENT REPORTEDLY ORDERED
 THAT HE BE GIVEN A TOP SECURITY
 CLEARANCE DESPITE ALL THE RED
 FLAGS THAT WERE RAISED BY
 INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS, AND THE
 PRESIDENT'S CHIEF OF STAFF AND
 WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL BEING SO
 ALARMED BY THE PRESIDENT'S
 DECISION THAT THEY BOTH WROTE
 CONTEMPORANEOUS MEMOS
 DOCUMENTING WHY THEY THOUGHT
 JARED KUSHNER SHOULD NEVER HAVE
 GOTTEN A CLEARANCE.
 AND YES, SOMEONE IN THE
 ADMINISTRATION WHO HAS A BEEF
 WITH JARED MAY BE LEAKING THIS
 STUFF TO UNDERCUT HIM.
 THAT IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE, BUT
 THIS IS ALSO SOMEONE SOUNDING AN
 ALARM THAT THIS GUY IS HAVING A
 LOT OF TROUBLE GETTING A
 SECURITY CLEARANCE FOR A REASON,
 AND LIKE I SAID, WE ARE USED TO
 THESE LEAKS TO THE MEDIA.
 EVERY DAY IT SEEMS WE GET AT
 LEAST ONE.
 BUT TODAY WE GOT A SIGNAL THAT
 THERE MAY BE A SUBSTANTIAL SHIFT
 UNDERWAY IN THE NATURE AND THE
 SERIOUSNESS OF THESE
 DISCLOSURES, A SHIFT THAT HAS
 ALL KINDS OF IMPLICATIONS FOR
 OVERSIGHT AND FOR INVESTIGATIONS
 OF THIS WHITE HOUSE.
 THE HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE
 HAS BEEN ASKING THE WHITE HOUSE
 FOR DOCUMENTS ON THE SECURITY
 CLEARANCE ISSUE FOR WEEKS, EVER
 SINCE DEMOCRATS TOOK OVER THE
 COMMITTEE, AND THIS WEEK THE
 WHITE HOUSE FINALLY SAID NO.
 NO DOCUMENTS, WHICH WAS EXPECTED
 TO TRIGGER A SUBPOENA FROM THE
 COMMITTEE AND THEN POSSIBLY A
 BIG HUGE FIGHT OVER THAT
 SUBPOENA.
 WELL, TODAY "AXIOS" REPORTS THAT
 THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE HAS
 ALREADY GOTTEN ITS HANDS ON A
 NUMBER OF THE DOCUMENTS.
 THEY WERE LEAKED TO THE
 COMMITTEE BY SOMEONE INSIDE THE
 WHITE HOUSE, QUOTE, THE HOUSE
 OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE IN EARLY
 FEBRUARY HAD ALREADY OBTAINED
 THE LEAKED DOCUMENTS, THAT
 DETAIL THE ENTIRE PROCESS FROM
 THE SPRING OF 2017 TO THE SPRING
 OF 2018 ON HOW BOTH JARED
 KUSHNER AND IVANKA TRUMP WERE
 ULTIMATELY GRANTED THEIR
 SECURITY CLEARANCES.
 HMM, THINK ABOUT THAT.
 LEAKING DAMAGING INVESTIGATION
 OR SOUND THE ALARM TYPE OF
 INFORMATION TO THE PRESS IS ONE
 THING.
 LEAKING DOCUMENTS WITH NATIONAL
 SECURITY IMPLICATIONS TO A
 CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE
 CONTROLLED BY THE OPPOSITION
 PARTY WITH BROAD INVESTIGATORY
 AND SUBPOENA POWER, IF THIS
 REPORT IS CORRECT, WE MAY BE IN
 A WHOLE NEW BALL GAME.
 JOINING ME NOW IS CONGRESSMAN RO
 KHANNA WHO SITS ON THE OVERSIGHT
 COMMITTEE.
 CONGRESSMAN, THANKS SO MUCH FOR
 JOINING US.
 JOY, IT'S GOOD TO BE ON.
 LET'S GO AND GET INTO THIS
 LEAK.
 OBVIOUSLY NOW THE COMMITTEE HAS
 THE DOCUMENTS THAT WALK YOUR
 COMMITTEE THROUGH THE PROCESS OF
 HOW JARED KUSHNER AND IVANKA
 TRUMP GOT THEIR SECURITY
 CLEARANCES.
 WHAT NOW DOES THE COMMITTEE WANT
 TO DO ABOUT IT?
 IS THIS GOING TO TRIGGER
 HEARINGS, AND COULD WE SEE
 IVANKA TRUMP AND JARED KUSHNER
 FORCED TO TESTIFY OR WHITE HOUSE
 OFFICIALS WHO GRANTED THEM THEIR
 CLEARANCES?
 JOY, LET ME EXPLAIN WHY THIS
 IS SUCH A BIG DEAL.
 FOR A PRESIDENT WHO SPENT THE
 ENTIRE 2016 CAMPAIGN TRAIL
 RAILING AGAINST HILLARY
 CLINTON'S PRIVATE E-MAIL
 SERVERS, THIS IS A FAR BIGGER
 NATIONAL SECURITY CRISIS.
 THERE ARE ALLEGATIONS THAT JARED
 KUSHNER HAD SENSITIVE
 INFORMATION THAT HE HAS
 ALLEGEDLY BEEN GIVING LISTS TO
 MBS, THE SAUDI CROWN PRINCE
 ABOUT SAUDI DISSIDENCE, THAT
 HE'S BEEN ON WHATSAPP WITH SAUDI

 ARABIA'S CROWN PRINCE, AND WE
 NEED TO KNOW WHAT IS IT THAT'S
 IN HIS BACKGROUND THAT WAS
 CAUSING CONCERN.
 HAS HE BEEN SHARING SENSITIVE
 TOP SECRET INFORMATION WITH
 PEOPLE IN SAUDI ARABIA OR OTHER
 COUNTRIES?
 WHY IS IT THAT HE HAS NOT
 DISCLOSED A NUMBER OF HIS
 FOREIGN BUSINESS RELATIONS.
 THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE.
 IT'S NOT A BUREAUCRATIC ISSUE.
 THIS IS OUR MOST SENSITIVE
 INFORMATION THAT MAY BE GETTING
 INTO THE WRONG HANDS.
 AND CAN I ASK YOU, DOES THE
 COMMITTEE HAS THE
 CONTEMPORANEOUS NOTES THAT JOHN
 KELLY, THE FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF
 AND THE WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL DON
 McGAHN WROTE ABOUT THESE TWO
 OBTAINING THESE CLEARANCES?
 DO YOU ALL HAVE THESE NOTES?
 I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THOSE
 YET, BUT AS YOU POINTED OUT,
 BOTH JOHN KELLY AND THE WHITE
 HOUSE COUNSEL AT THE TIME WERE
 OPPOSED TO THE DECISION TO GIVE
 JARED KUSHNER TOP SECRET
 CLEARANCE.
 THEY WERE SO OPPOSED TO IT THAT
 THEY FELT THE NEED TO WRITE A
 MEMO DOCUMENTING HOW CONCERNED
 THEY WERE AND WHY JARED KUSHNER
 SHOULDN'T BE GET THIS
 INFORMATION.
 THIS HAS IMPLICATIONS ABOUT OUR
 POLICY IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
 I MEAN, THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE
 JARED KUSHNER THE POINT PERSON
 ON MIDDLE EAST PEACE OR MIDDLE
 EAST POLICY, AND WE NEED TO KNOW
 WHAT INFORMATION HE HAS AND WHO
 IS HE SHARING IT WITH.
 AND IN THE DOCUMENTS THAT
 WERE LEAKED TO THE COMMITTEE, IS
 THERE ANYTHING IN THOSE
 DOCUMENTS THAT INDICATES TO YOU
 THAT JARED KUSHNER MIGHT HAVE
 SHARED CLASSIFIED INFORMATION
 WITH THE SAUDI PRINCE?
 I CAN'T SAY IT'S IN THAT, BUT
 THERE HAS BEEN PUBLIC REPORTING
 ON A NUMBER OF KEY POINTS.
 ONE, THAT JARED KUSHNER HAD
 ACCESS TO THE PRESIDENTS' DAILY
 BRIEF.
 IN THAT DAILY BRIEF WERE
 NUMEROUS REPORTS ABOUT SAUDI
 DISSIDENTS AND HE ALLEGEDLY
 SHARED THAT LIST WITH THE SAUDI
 CROWN PRINCE.
 SECOND, JARED KUSHNER HAS HAD
 MEETINGS WITH THE SAUDI PRINCE
 WITHOUT HAVING ANYONE IN OUR
 EMBASSY THERE.
 THAT IS NOT STANDARD PROTOCOL.
 WE KNOW THE CROWN PRINCE MOST
 LIKELY ORDERED THE KILLING OF
 KHASHOGGI.
 WE KNOW HIS ORDERING THE BOMBING
 OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF
 CIVILIANS IN YEMEN, AND HERE
 THERE ARE SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS OF
 WHAT JARED KUSHNER IS SHARING
 WITH HIM.
 THIS IS NOT A BUREAUCRATIC
 ISSUE.
 THIS IS A HUGELY SENSITIVE ISSUE
 ABOUT THE HIGHEST NATIONAL
 SECURITY OF THIS COUNTRY.
 AND WE KNOW JUST FROM PUBLIC
 REPORTING THAT ONE OF THE
 CHALLENGES THAT JARED KUSHNER
 LIKELY HAD GET AGO CLEARANCE WAS
 THE FACT THAT HE WAS IN A LOT OF
 DEBT.
 HE HAD A BUILDING HERE IN
 MANHATTAN THAT HAD A BIG BALLOON
 PAYMENT DUE.
 HIS FATHER WAS REPORTEDLY
 LOOKING -HELPING HIM TO LOOK
 FOR WAYS TO PAY THAT BILL.
 HAVE YOU FOUND IN ANYTHING OF
 THOSE LEAKED DOCUMENTS, ANY OF
 THOSE LEAKED DOCUMENTS, ANYTHING
 THAT WOULD INDICATE TO YOU THAT
 JARED KUSHNER WAS SEEKING
 FUNDING, SEEKING MONEY FROM THE
 MIDDLE EAST WHILE HE WAS IN THE
 MIDDLE EAST PURPORTEDLY
 NEGOTIATING ON BEHALF OF THE
 UNITED STATES?
 I CAN'T COMMENT ON THOSE
 DOCUMENTS, BUT JUST IN GENERAL,
 THE PUBLIC REPORTING THERE ARE
 HUGE REPORTS THAT JARED KUSHNER
 HASN'T BEEN FULLY FORTHCOMING
 ABOUT ALL OF HIS OVERSEAS
 BUSINESS DEALINGS AND ALL OF HIS
 FOREIGN CONTACTS.
 YOU KNOW, I HAD A SECURITY
 BACKGROUND CHECK WHEN I WORKED
 AT THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT.
 YOU HAVE TO DISCLOSE EVERY
 SINGLE PERSON YOU'VE EVER MET
 WITH IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY IN THE
 PAST SEVEN YEARS, AND FOR
 KUSHNER NOT TO HAVE DISCLOSED
 FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS OR HIS
 OVERSEES CONTACTS PUTS HIM AND
 THE COUNTRY IN A VULNERABLE
 SPOT.
 IT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN SOMETHING
 HE REALIZED PUT HIM IN A
 VULNERABLE SPOT.
 THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THESE
 BACKGROUND CHECKS TO SEE IF
 SOMEONE COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
 HIM.
 AND I HAVE CONCERNS WHETHER THE
 SAUDIS HAVE BEEN TAKEN ADVANTAGE
 OF THE SITUATION.
 CONGRESSMAN, THANK YOU SO
 MUCH.
 REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TIME
 TONIGHT.
 JOY, THANKS FOR HAVING ME
 BACK ON.
 IF THIS REPORT TODAY FROM
 "AXIOS" IS ACCURATE THAT SOMEONE
 INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE HAS
 LEAKED DOCUMENTS TO THE HOUSE
 OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE ABOUT HOW
 JARED KUSHNER AND IVANKA TRUMP
 GOT THEIR SECURITY CLEARANCES,
 DOCUMENTS THE WHITE HOUSE HAS
 BEEN REFUSING TO HAND OVER TO
 THAT COMMITTEE, HOW BIG A CHANGE
 IS THAT FROM THE RUN-OF-THE-MILL
 LEAKS TO THE PRESS THAT WE'VE
 ALL GOTTEN ACCUSTOMED TO.
 HOW WORRIED SHOULD THE WHITE
 HOUSE BE?
 JOINING US NOW IS MICHAEL
 BESH LATCH.
 HOW UNPRECEDENTED IS IT FOR
 THE WHITE HOUSE TO HAND OVER
 DOCUMENTS OF THIS SENSITIVE
 NATURE AND HAVE SOMEONE IN THE
 WHITE HOUSE LEAK IT TO A
 CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE?
 THAT'S THE THING, ANYONE
 WHO'S COMPLAINING THAT THE TRUMP
 WHITE HOUSE IS NOT FULL OF
 INNOVATIONS, HERE IS ONE OF
 THEM, WHICH IS USUALLY YOU SEE
 SOMEONE IN THE WHITE HOUSE
 LEAKING SOMETHING TO THE PRESS,
 AND IF THERE'S AN INVESTIGATION
 IN CONGRESS, THE COMMITTEE USES
 IT.
 THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE, IF THAT
 IS THE SOURCE OF THESE
 DOCUMENTS, HAS NOW CUT OUT THE
 MIDDLE PERSON.
 YOU KNOW, JOY, MAYBE TWO OF THE
 BIGGEST REVELATIONS OF
 GOVERNMENT SECRETS IN THE LAST
 50 YEARS WERE THE PENTAGON
 PAPERS AND THE NIXON TAPES.
 THE PENTAGON PAPERS WERE LEAKED
 BY A FORMER PENTAGON EMPLOYEE
 DANIEL ELSBERG TO THE "NEW YORK
 TIMES" AND "THE WASHINGTON POST"
 BECAUSE HE FELT THIS WAS
 SOMETHING AMERICANS NEEDED TO
 SEE, HOW WE GOT INTO THIS
 CATASTROPHIC VIETNAM WAR.
 AND THE NIXON TAPES, THAT WAS
 ONE OF THE MOST CLOSELY HELD
 SECRETS IN THE NIXON WHITE
 HOUSE.
 A MEMBER OF THE SENATE WATERGATE
 COMMITTEE STAFF BASICALLY GUESS
 THAT HAD PERHAPS NIXON WAS
 TAPING HIS PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS
 AND ASKED A SERVING WHITE HOUSE
 AIDE ALEXANDER BUTTERFIELD.
 THAT'S THE TRADITIONAL WAY, VERY
 DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE'RE SEEING
 NOW WITH THESE DOCUMENTS FROM
 THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE.
 JUST TO TAKE IT FURTHER
 AFIELD, RIGHT, IF DONALD TRUMP,
 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
 STATES ORDERED THESE SECURITY
 CLEARANCES TO BE GRANTED OVER
 THE OBJECTIONS OF HIS NATIONAL
 SECURITY ADVISERS, NATIONAL
 SECURITY STAFF, ULYSSES S.
 GRANTED TESTIFIED IN THE WHISKEY
 RING SCANDAL, RIGHT, THERE IS A
 PRECEDENT OF A PRESIDENT OF THE
 UNITED STATES GIVING TESTIMONY
 TO A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR, NO
 LESS.
 OH, SURE.
 COULD YOU SEE TRUMP HAVE TO
 DO THAT?
 GERALD FORD TESTIFIED BEFORE
 THE HOUSE SAYING THERE WAS NO
 DEAL LEADING TO THE NIXON
 PARDON.
 HE DID THAT IN THE FALL OF 1974:
 THERE SURE IS.
 SO SOME OF THESE OLD TRADITIONS,

 EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE IS A
 TRADITION.
 IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S IN THE
 CONSTITUTION.
 AND LASTLY, IS THERE AN

 ANTECEDENT TO A JARED KUSHNER,
 SOMEONE WHO HAD SO MUCH DEBT,
 AND WAS IN A POSITION TO READ
 THE PRESIDENTS' DAILY BRIEF.
 AND IF HE USED HIS POSITION,
 IF HE DID TO ESSENTIALLY
 COMPROMISE OUR AMERICAN SECURITY
 INTERESTS IN ORDER TO GET MONEY
 TO BAIL OUT HIS FAMILY IN THAT
 BUILDING, THAT IS SOMETHING THAT
 WE HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE, AND
 YOU HAVE TO ASSUME THAT WHOEVER
 LEAKED THIS, IF THIS IS SOMEONE
 IN THE WHITE HOUSE, FELT THAT
 THIS WAS SUCH AN OUTRAGE AND
 THERE WAS SUCH A DANGER THAT
 THERE MIGHT BE FUTURE SUCH
 BEHAVIOR IF JARED KUSHNER OR HIS
 WIFE HAD TOP SECURITY CLEARANCES
 THAT THEY WOULD BE A CLEAR AND
 PRESENT DANGER.
 WE'VE GOT TO LOOK AT THIS AS A
 CRY FOR HELP.
 IT'S ALL EXTRAORDINARY.
 NEW HISTORICAL RECORDS BEING SET
 EVERY DAY.
 THANK YOU, SIR, REALLY
 APPRECIATE IT.
 THANK YOU, JOY.
 SEE YOU SOON.
 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
 STILL AHEAD TONIGHT, LITTLE
 COURT TRANSCRIPT THEATER, GO GET
 YOUR POPCORN.
 I'LL WAIT RIGHT HERE, AND WE'LL
 BE RIGHT BACK.

 WE NOW KNOW FROM THE TRANSCRIPT OF YESTERDAY'S PAUL
 MANAFORT SENTENCING THAT MOMENTS
 AFTER THE JUDGE HANDED DOWN HIS
 FATE MANAFORT'S DEFENSE TEAM
 MADE ONE LAST BRAZEN APPEAL.
 SPECIFICALLY MANAFORT LAWYER
 KEVIN DOWNING ASKED JUDGE T.S.
 ELLIS IF HE COULD ORDER -AND I
 DID SAY ORDER -THAT THE
 SENTENCE HE HAD JUST ISSUED BE
 SERVED CONCURRENTLY WITH
 WHATEVER SENTENCE THE JUDGE IN
 HIS D.C. CASE ISSUES NEXT WEEK.
 NOW HERE'S THE TRANSCRIPT.
 I CANNOT DO THIS AS WELL AS
 RACHEL BUT GO WITH ME ON THIS,
 QUOTE, YOUR HONOR THERE IS ONE
 OTHER ISSUE WE'D LIKE TO RAISE,
 MANAFORT'S LAWYER TOLD THE
 JUDGE.
 IT HAS TO DO WITH WHETHER OR NOT
 YOU CAN ORDER THIS SENTENCE TO
 BE CONCURRENTLY SERVED WITH --
 AT WHICH POINT THE JUDGE
 INTERRUPTS HIM TO SAY -QUOTE,
 I CAN'T BUT SHE CAN.
 I DON'T BELIEVE I CAN IF YOU
 FIND IN THE LAW THAT I'M
 INCORRECT, YOU CAN BRING THAT TO
 MY ATTENTION.
 THE JUDGE THEN ADDS I THINK IT
 IS ENTIRELY UP TO HER WHETHER
 ANY SENTENCE SHE IMPOSES IS TO
 RUN CONCURRENT TO THIS SENTENCE.
 IT'S UP TO HER.
 ANYTHING ELSE, MR. DOWNING?
 TO WHICH MANAFORT'S LAWYER
 REPLIED, NO YOUR HONOR.
 WHICH IS A MORE DIPLOMATIC WAY
 OF SAYING OF COURSE NOT.
 I MEAN, IT TAKES A SPECIAL LEVEL
 OF RICH GUY PRIVILEGE TO THINK
 THAT YOU COULD ASK THE JUDGE,
 WHO JUST CUT YOU A MASSIVE
 BREAK, TO MAKE SURE THAT THE
 NEXT JUDGE MAKES THAT BREAK
 STICK.
 SO CLEARLY THERE'S NO SENSE OF
 CONTRITION OR REMORSE FROM
 MANAFORT'S CAMP, LIKE NONE, BUT
 RATHER A PRETTY BOLD PRESUMPTION
 THAT THE SYSTEM SHOULD AND WILL
 CONTINUE TO WORK FOR HIM.
 NEXT WEEK MANAFORT WILL BE IN
 COURT BEFORE JUDGE AMY BERMAN
 JACKSON WHO FIRST ORDERED
 MANAFORT TO JAIL FOR TAMPERING
 WITH WITNESSES WHO COULD TACK ON
 AS MUCH AS TEN YEARS TO THE FOUR
 THAT HE'S ALREADY FACING BEHIND
 BARS.
 MANAFORT'S ULTIMATE FATE NEXT
 WEEK COMES AS THE PROSPECT OF
 MUELLER'S REPORT LOOMS OVER
 EVERYTHING.
 TODAY THE TOP REPUBLICAN ON THE
 HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SAID
 THAT HE MET RECENTLY WITH
 ATTORNEY GENERAL BILL BARR AND
 PREDICTED THAT THE PUBLIC MAY
 ONLY GET A SHORT SUMMARY OF
 MUELLER'S FINDINGS.
 GREAT.
 THIS IS ALL FINE.
 HIS REMARKS TODAY COME AS THE
 DEMOCRATIC CHAIRS OF SIX HOUSE
 COMMITTEES INTRODUCED A
 RESOLUTION THAT WHEN COMPLETED
 THE MUELLER REPORT SHOULD BE
 MADE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND
 TO CONGRESS.
 JOINING ME NOW IS DAVID CORN,
 WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF AND
 CHUCK ROSENBERG FORMER U.S.
 ATTORNEY FROM VIRGINIA.
 DAVID AND CHUCK, I APPRECIATE
 YOUR TIME.
 CHUCK, I'M GOING TO GO TO YOU
 FIRST TO ASK HOW UNUSUAL IT IS,
 JUST FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW,
 FOR A DEFENDANT WHO WAS JUST
 SENTENCED TO SAY TO THE JUDGE,
 HEY, JUDGE, CAN YOU MAKE THE
 NEXT JUDGE MAKE THE SENTENCE
 CONCURRENT SO THAT I CAN HAVE
 LESS TIME?
 LIKE IS THAT NORMAL AT ALL?
 WELL, YOU KNOW, JOY, I WAS A
 PROSECUTOR FOR A LONG TIME IN
 FEDERAL COURT, AND DEFENSE
 ATTORNEYS ASK FOR ALL CRAZY
 THINGS.
 THIS ONE IS AN EASY ONE.
 THERE'S A FEDERAL STATUTE RIGHT
 ON POINT.
 I'M GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF
 A NERD HERE, BUT IF YOUR VIEWERS
 WANT TO READ IT'S TITLE 18 OF
 THE UNITED STATES CODE SECTION

 THE SIMPLE ANSWER IS NO.
 THE NEXT JUDGE, AMY BERMAN
 JACKSON GETS TO RUN THE SENTENCE
 CONSECUTIVELY IF SHE WANTS OR
 CONCURRENT IF SHE WANTS OR SOME
 COMBINATION OF THE TWO.
 I'VE SEEN LOTS AND LOTS OF
 DEFENSE ATTORNEYS ASK FOR THINGS
 THEY KNOW THEY CAN'T HAVE, AND
 THE JUDGE WAS RIGHT IN THIS CASE
 TO SAY NOT IN MY COURT, NOT IN
 MY JURISDICTION.
 I DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO
 GIVE YOU WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR.
 A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE SHOCKED
 BY HOW LITTLE TIME THAT MANAFORT
 WAS GIVEN FOR THIS SENTENCE,
 THIS STUFF ABOUT HIM LEADING AN
 EXEMPLARY LIFE.
 WE KNOW WHAT HIS LIFE WAS BEFORE
 HAND.
 WERE YOU EQUALLY SHOCKED BY IT,
 AND DO YOU THINK THAT THAT SHOCK
 AND OUTRAGE THAT PEOPLE FELT
 AROUND THE COUNTRY WILL IMPACT
 JUDGE AMY BERMAN JACKSON'S
 DECISION?
 DO JUDGES REACT TO THE PUBLIC
 REACTION TO OTHER SENTENCES?
 YOU KNOW, THEY PROBABLY TRY
 NOT TO, BUT THEY'RE HUMAN BEING
 LIKE ALL OF US AND INEVITABLY
 SHE SAW WHAT JUDGE ELLIS DID IN
 VIRGINIA AND HAD SOME SORT OF
 REACTION TO IT, I'M SURE IN HER
 OWN MIND, PROBABLY ALREADY
 HAVING READ, JOY, THE
 PRESENTENCE REPORT FROM MR.
 MANAFORT IN HER COURT.
 SHE HAS AN IDEA OF WHAT SHE
 THINKS IS THE JUST OUTCOME HERE.
 WAS I SHOCKED?
 NOT ENTIRELY.
 I'VE PRACTICED IN FRONT OF JUDGE
 ELLIS FOR MANY YEARS AS A
 FEDERAL PROSECUTOR.
 WAS I DISAPPOINTED?
 I WAS DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED.
 I THINK IT WAS THE WRONG CALL, A
 BAD CALL.
 HERE'S WHY.
 MANY, MANY YEARS AGO CONGRESS
 PASSED A STATUTE TO CREATE
 FEDERAL SENTENCING GUIDELINES TO
 BRING SOME PARODY -PARITY INTO
 THE SYSTEM, SO SOMEBODY DID WHAT
 MANAFORT DID IN TOPEKA OR
 WHEREVER WOULD GET ROUGHLY THE
 SAME SENTENCE REGARDLESS OF
 WHICH COURT WAS HANDLING THE
 MATTER.
 THIS WAS NOT JUST A DEPARTURE,
 THIS WAS A DRAMATIC DEPARTURE,
 AND IT WAS A DEPARTURE WITHOUT A
 MOTIVE FROM THE GOVERNMENT.
 NORMALLY IF SOMEONE HELPS THE
 GOVERNMENT, THE GOVERNMENT WILL
 MOVE THE COURT, ASK THE COURT TO
 DEPART DOWNWARD.
 MANAFORT DID NOT HELP, HE LIED.
 HE DID NOT EARN A DEPARTURE.
 HE CERTAINLY WAS NOT ENTITLED TO
 WHAT HE GOT.
 HE GOT A REAL LUCKY BREAK IN
 FRONT OF JUDGE ELLIS.
 I DON'T THINK THE SAME THING IS
 GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT WEEK.
 THAT'S PART OF WHAT'S
 OUTRAGEOUS ABOUT THIS.
 YOU HAVE MICHAEL COHEN OUT HERE
 BEARING HIS SOUL IN FRONT OF
 CONGRESS AND GOING BACK OVER AND
 OVER AGAIN WITHOUT A DEAL.
 HE KNOWS HE'S GETTING THREE
 YEARS REGARDLESS.
 MAYBE HE'LL GET A BREAK DOWN THE
 ROAD.
 MANAFORT WASN'T A GUY WHO WAS
 HELPING THE GOVERNMENT.
 AS A MATTER OF FACT HE WAS
 OBSTRUCTING THE GOVERNMENT'S
 ATTEMPT TO FIND THE TRUTH HERE,
 TAMPERING WITH WITNESSES, ALL
 THE OTHER THINGS HE DID.
 JUST PREVIEW FOR ME -I GUESS
 NOT THE OPTICS IS THE WRONG
 WORD, I FEEL BUT IF IN THE END
 THIS MAN WHO DID NOT HELP, THEN
 THE MUELLER REPORT COMES OUT AND
 WE DON'T EVEN GET TO SEE IT,
 WHAT ARE WE LEFT WITH HERE AS A
 COUNTRY AFTER HAVING GONE
 THROUGH THREE YEARS OF THIS.
 THAT WON'T BE THE END OF IT,
 OKAY?
 I'M A LITTLE BIT FRUSTRATED,
 JOY, BECAUSE PEOPLE SEEM TO BE
 PUTTING ALL THEIR EGGS IN THE
 MUELLER REPORT BASKET, AND
 MUELLER HAS NO OBLIGATION UNDER
 THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
 GUIDELINES TO PRODUCE A
 COMPREHENSIVE REPORT TELLING,
 STATING WHAT HE FOUND OUT AND
 WHAT HE LEARNED.
 HIS ONLY OBLIGATION IS TO GIVE A
 REPORT AT THE VERY END TO THE
 ATTORNEY GENERAL EXPLAINING WHY
 HE PROSECUTED CASES OR DECLINED
 TO PROSECUTE OTHER CASES.
 YOU KNOW, IT COULD EASILY BE A
 12-PAGE REPORT, YOU KNOW,
 WITHOUT GETTING INTO DETAILS, OR
 IF HE CHOSE TO, IT COULD BE A
 5,000 PAGE REPORT EXPLAINING
 EVERYTHING HE FOUND AND WHY HE
 DECIDED TO PROSECUTE OR NOT
 PROSECUTE.
 WE DON'T KNOW, SO IT MAY WELL BE
 AT THE END OF THE DAY IF IT'S A
 MORE LIMITED REPORT, THERE MAY
 NOT BE MUCH TO SHOW.
 THIS GETS BACK TO A POINT THAT I
 KNOW YOU AND I HAVE DISCUSSED
 PREVIOUSLY.
 IT'S NOT HIS JOB TO TELL
 AMERICANS THE TRUTH.
 THAT'S NOT WHAT HE WAS HIRED TO
 DO.
 HE WAS HIRED TO PROSECUTE, LOOK
 FOR AND THEN PROSECUTE CRIMINAL
 CASES.
 IT'S CONGRESS'S JOB, AND WE ARE
 MAYBE AN INDEPENDENT COMMISSION
 TO DIG INTO ALL OF THIS AND TELL
 US WHAT HAPPENED WITH TRUMP
 RUSSIA CONNECTIONS AND
 EVERYTHING ELSE AND THE RUSSIAN
 INTERVENTION BECAUSE A LOT OF
 PROBABLY WHAT WENT ON MAY NOT
 HAVE BEEN A CRIME.
 IT COULD BE JUST WRONG.
 YOU CAN HAVE SCANDALS THAT
 AREN'T NECESSARILY ILLEGAL BUT
 THEY STILL CAN CONTAIN ACTS OF
 PROFOUND BETRAYAL.
 SO YOU KNOW, WE STILL HAVE THE
 HOUSE DEMOCRATS HAVE TAKEN
 CONTROL OF THE INTELLIGENCE
 COMMITTEE AND ARE GOING BACK
 OVER AN INVESTIGATION THAT THE
 REPUBLICANS TURNED INTO A CLOWN
 SHOW, AND SO THERE'S THAT, AND
 HOPEFULLY THEY WILL GIVE US SOME
 DEEPER AND WIDER ANSWERS THAN
 ROBERT MUELLER WAS EVER ASKED TO
 DO.
 BUT YOU KNOW, DAVID MY
 FRIEND, YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THAT
 WHAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE SAYING
 PUBLICLY, WHAT YOU'RE HEARING IN
 THE REPORTING IS THAT THEY ARE
 HANGING EVERYTHING ON THE
 MUELLER REPORT.
 THAT THEY DON'T EVEN WANT TO
 TALK ABOUT IMPEACHMENT, WHICH IS
 THE HEARINGS THAT WOULD GET THE
 PUBLIC THE ANSWERS YOU JUST
 DESCRIBED.
 THEY WOULD HAVE A PUBLIC
 HEARING.
 IT ISN'T REMOVAL.
 IT'S IMPEACHMENT AS AERING HA.
 THEY'RE SAYING NO, NOT UNLESS
 THE MUELLER REPORT COMES OUT.
 NOT NECESSARILY.
 I BELIEVE THEY ARE SETTING UP
 EXPECTATIONS AND STANDARDS FOR
 THE MUELLER REPORT THAT MAY WELL
 BE UNJUSTIFIED, AND SORT OF
 PAINTING THEMSELVES INTO A
 CORNER.
 BUT YOU CAN HAVE A ROBUST
 INVESTIGATION WITH PUBLIC
 HEARINGS INTO THE RUSSIA
 CONNECTIONS AND INTO, YOU KNOW,
 EMOLUMENTS, AND INTO TRUMP BAD
 BUSINESS PRACTICES.
 YOU CAN DO ALL THAT THROUGH
 THESE COMMITTEES WITHOUT IT
 BEING AN IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDING.
 I WOULD ARGUE IT'S PROBABLY MORE
 RESPONSIBLE OF DEMOCRATS IN
 CONGRESS TO LOOK AT ALL THESE
 VARIOUS THINGS THAT NEED FURTHER
 DIGGING AND SCRUTINY, AND THAT
 THE PUBLIC DESERVES TO KNOW
 ABOUT THE SECURITY CLEARANCE
 ISSUE THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT
 EARLIER IN THE SHOW, AND THEY
 SHOULD SPEND THEIR TIME NOT
 WORRYING ABOUT TO IMPEACH OR NOT
 TO IMPEACH.
 GO AFTER THE TAX RETURNS, LOOK
 AT THE INSURANCE ISSUES THAT
 MICHAEL COHEN HAS RAISED, THE
 TAX FRAUD STORY THE "NEW YORK
 TIMES" PUT TOGETHER MONTHS AGO,
 ABOUT THE TRUMP FAMILY GETTING
 AWAY WITH HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS
 OF DOLLARS IN TAX FRAUD.
 THAT'S AMAZING.
 THEY SHOULD LOOK AT EACH AND
 EVERY ONE OF THESE AND AT THE
 END OF THE DAY THEY CAN HAVE A
 DEBATE OVER WHETHER TO IMPEACH
 OR NOT, BY THEN IT MIGHT BE
 ELECTION TIME.
 THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IS OWED
 ANSWERS AND YOU DON'T NEED
 IMPEACHMENT TO DO THAT.
 WE ARE OUT OF TIME, BUT CHUCK
 ROSENBERG VERY QUICKLY, CAN YOU
 ENVISION A LEAK OF THE MUELLER
 REPORT, WHATEVER IT IS, COMING
 OUT OF THAT WHITE HOUSE
 COUNSEL'S OFFICE IF IT'S NOT
 RELEASED?
 I CAN'T IMAGINE IT COMING
 FROM THE MUELLER TEAM, JOY, BUT
 ALMOST EVERYTHING BECOMES PUBLIC
 IN SOME WAY AT SOME POINT.
 MY GUESS IS THAT WE'LL SEE IT,
 BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE IT
 FROM BOB MUELLER.
 HE'S RUNNING A VERY TIGHT SHIP
 OVER THERE.
 YES, HE IS.
 WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF FOR
 MOTHER JONES, CHUCK ROSENBERG
 FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY FROM
 VIRGINIA.
 THANK YOU GUYS VERY MUCH.
 SO I'M NOT AN ACCOUNTANT,
 TAX LAW IS NOT MY THING.
 STATISTICALLY SPEAKING IT'S
 PROBABLY NOT YOUR THING EITHER.
 BUT THERE'S A STRONG POSSIBILITY
 IT'S ABOUT TO BE.
 MORE ON THAT IN A MINUTE.

    Liberty Mutual customizes       your car insurance,

         Nice. But, uh...
          what's up with         your... partner?
 Oh. Well, we just spend all day telling everyone
         how we customize          car insurance,
      because no two people         are alike, so...
           LiMu gets a         little confused

 THE NEW DEMOCRATIC HOUSE HAS USHERED IN A WHOLE LOT OF
 CHANGES.
 APART FROM ALL THE NEW
 INCREDIBLY DIVERSE FRESHMEN
 MEMBERS, AND A NEW IF RETURNING
 SPEAKER AT THE HELM, THE CHANGE
 IN LEADERSHIP IN THE COMMITTEES
 MEANS THAT WE ARE SEEING
 OVERSIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME
 SINCE DONALD TRUMP ENTERED THE
 WHITE HOUSE, AND THAT KICKED
 INTO HIGH GEAR EARLIER THIS WEEK
 WHEN THE HOUSE JUDICIARY
 COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN JERRY
 NADLER'S COMMITTEE SENT OVER A
 SWEEPING DOCUMENT REQUEST TO 81
 PEOPLE AND ENTITIES RELATED TO
 TRUMP WORLD.
 THAT HAPPENED ON MONDAY.
 ON TUESDAY WE LEARNED THAT THE
 HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE
 IS PREPARING TO GO AFTER A
 DECADE'S WORTH OF TRUMP TAX
 RETURNS, AND THEY PLAN ON DOING
 SO USING A 1924 LAW THAT GIVES
 THE CHAIRMAN OF THAT COMMITTEE
 BROAD POWER TO DEMAND THE TAX
 RETURNS OF WHITE HOUSE
 OFFICIALS.
 IN THIS CASE THE WHITE HOUSE
 OFFICIAL IS THE PRESIDENT.
 TODAY WE'RE LEARNING THAT THAT
 COMMITTEE MIGHT BE TAKING THAT
 REQUEST ONE STEP FURTHER.
 REUTERS IS REPORTING THAT
 DEMOCRATS ARE LOOKING AT THE
 POSSIBILITY OF BROADENING THE
 REQUEST TO ASK FOR DONALD
 TRUMP'S BUSINESS RETURNS.
 NOW TRUMP OWNS MORE THAN 500
 COMPANIES AND ENTITIES, AND WHAT
 THAT EXACTLY MEANS, BASICALLY,
 IS THAT DONALD TRUMP'S BUSINESS
 IS NOT REALLY A BUSINESS IN THE
 SENSE THAT WE UNDERSTAND IT.
 THOSE MORE THAN 500 COMPANIES
 ARE ALL A SERIES OF LLCs THAT
 NORMALLY SHOULD SHOW UP ON YOUR
 PERSONAL INCOME TAXES.
 THAT SETUP IS COMMON IN THE NEW
 YORK REAL ESTATE BUSINESS, SO
 FOR THE COMMITTEE THE FIRST STEP
 WOULD BE TO GET TRUMP'S PERSONAL
 RETURNS TO LOOK FOR THOSE
 500-PLUS LLC'S, AND IF THEY'RE
 NOT LISTED THERE, THEN STEP TWO
 WOULD BE TO TRY AND GO AND GET
 DONALD TRUMP'S BUSINESS TAX
 RETURNS.
 IT COULD GET COMPLICATED.
 THE CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE WAYS
 AND MEANS COMMITTEE TELLS
 REUTERS, QUOTE, TAX POLICY IS
 PRETTY COMPLICATED.
 THERE ARE TIMES WHEN INDIVIDUAL
 RETURNS CAN INSTRUCT YOU.
 OTHER TIMES YOU MIGHT SEEK A
 BUSINESS RETURN.
 THAT'S SOMETHING TO LOOK OUT
 FOR, AND IT DOES MAKE YOU THINK.
 IF DONALD TRUMP NEVER RAN FOR
 PRESIDENT, ALL OF THIS COULD
 HAVE REMAINED HIDDEN FOREVER.
 SO ELECTIONS DO HAVE
 CONSEQUENCES, INCLUDING FOR
 DONALD TRUMP.

     IT'S THE MOST     WONDERFUL LIFE ON EARTH.

 NOW TOO MANY KIDS DON'T HAVE PARENTS WHO CARE.
 GANGS AND DRUGS HAVE TAKEN OVER
 OUR STREETS AND UNDERMINED OUR
 SCHOOLS.
 EVERY DAY WE READ ABOUT SOMEBODY
 ELSE WHO HAS LITERALLY GOTTEN
 AWAY WITH MURDER.
 AFTER LYNDON JOHNSON MADE THE
 SURPRISE DECISION NOT TO RUN FOR
 PRESIDENT AGAIN IN MARCH OF 1968
 AND AFTER ANTI-WAR DEMOCRAT
 GEORGE McGOVERN WAS BLOWN OUT OF
 THE ELECTION BY LAW AND ORDER
 INCUMBENT RICHARD NIXON IN 1972
 DEMOCRATS WERE SHOOK.
 AND AFTER THOSE PRESIDENTIAL
 DEFEATS THERE WAS A WAY TO RUN
 FOR PRESIDENT AS A DEMOCRAT.
 THAT WAY WAS TO RUN AS A
 CENTRIST, TO TRY AND RECONNECT
 AS A DEMOCRAT WITH WHITE WORKING
 CLASS AND WHITE SUBURBAN VOTERS
 WHO FLED TO NIXON AND REAGAN IN

 IT WORKED FOR BILL CLINTON, IT'S
 ONE OF THE WAYS THAT CLINTON GOT
 ELECTED IN 1992.
 THOUGH HE WOUND UP APOLOGIZING
 FOR HIS PART IN MASS
 INCARCERATION ONCE HIS WIFE WAS
 RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, BEING
 TOUGH ON CRIME AND FENDING OFF
 REPUBLICANS ON THE ISSUE IS HOW
 BILL CLINTON CAME TO SIGN THE
 OMNIBUS BILL AGAINST CRIME IN

 TODAY DEMOCRATS WHO ARE TRYING
 TO RUN FROM THAT SAME PLAY BOOK
 ARE FINDING THEMSELVES IN A VERY
 DIFFERENT DEMOCRATIC PARTY WHERE
 THE PROGRESSIVE WING IS GETTING
 STRONGER AGAIN AND WINNING
 ELECTIONS FOR CONGRESS.
 CANDIDATES FOR PRESIDENT WHO
 MIGHT NATURALLY HAVE APPEALED TO
 THE RUST BELT WHITE WORKING
 CLASS VOTER 20 YEARS AGO ARE
 STRUGGLING TO FIGURE OUT A
 CREDIBLE PATH TO THE NOMINATION.
 THIS EARLY ON IN THE RACE.
 AND IT MAY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY
 WHAT KIND OF CANDIDATE OR
 PLATFORM WILL WORK IN THE
 DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY.
 JUST THIS WEEK WE'VE SEEN A
 NUMBER OF POTENTIAL CANDIDATES
 FROM THAT CENTRIST WING OF THE
 PARTY BEG OFF FROM RUNNING,
 FIRST ERIC HOLDER,
  ATTORNEY
 GENERAL UNDER POM IS NOT
 RUNNING.
 AND JEFF MERKLEY, ANOTHER CRIME
 BILL YES VOTE LAST TIME, AND NEW
 YORK MAYOR MICHAEL BLOOMBERG.
 ALSO THIS WEEK HILLARY CLINTON
 CONFIRMED IN A LOCAL TELEVISION
 INTERVIEW SHE WAS NOT RUNNING
 FOR PRESIDENT AGAIN, AND THE
 LATEST SENATOR SHERROD BROWN
 FROM OHIO ANNOUNCED HE WOULD
 RATHER STAY IN THE SENATE.
 WHICH BRINGS US TO JOE BIDEN,
 THE FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE
 UNITED STATES, THE RIDE OR DIE

 BESTIE OF BARACK OBAMA IS
 REPORTED TO BE SERIOUSLY
 CONSIDERING MAKING HIS THIRD RUN
 FOR PRESIDENT.
 THE CHALLENGE IS JOE BIDEN COMES
 FROM THAT LAW AND ORDER SCHOOL
 OF DEMOCRATIC POLITICS.
 WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO FIND IS THE
 KIND OF DIALOGUE ON CRIME THAT
 USED TO BE THE WAY THAT YOU
 BECAME THE NOMINEE.
 WHETHER IT'S THE WAY HE OVERSAW
 THE CLEARANCE THOMAS HEARINGS
 AND HIS TREATMENT OF ANITA HILL
 OR THE WAY HE WROTE AND DEFENDED
 THE 1994 CRIME BILL, ALL OF THAT
 IS GOING TO SOUND VERY DIFFERENT
 WHEN YOU HEAR IT PLAYED AGAIN
 TODAY.
 FOR JOE BIDEN, THE UPSIDE IS
 THAT HE WOULD ENTER THE RACE AS
 THE FRONT RUNNER IF HE GETS IN.
 FULL STOP, HE WAS THE VICE
 PRESIDENT.
 EVERYBODY KNOWS HIM, BUT THE
 RISK IS THE REPLAY.
 TODAY "THE WASHINGTON POST"
 PUBLISHED PARTS OF AN INTERVIEW
 BIDEN GAVE IN 1975 TO A LOCAL
 DELAWARE PAPER.
 AT THE TIME HE WAS A FRESHMAN
 SENATOR ON THE VERGE OF
 SUCCESSFULLY PASSING A MEASURE
 TO BLOCK FEDERAL FUNTDING FOR
 BUSSING THAT WOULD HELP
 INTEGRATE SCHOOL SYSTEMS.
 HE ARGUED AGAINST THAT, SAYING,
 QUOTE, THE REAL PROBLEM WITH
 BUSSING.
 YOU TAKE PEOPLE WHO AREN'T
 RACIST, PEOPLE WHO ARE GOOD
 CITIZENS WHO BELIEVE IN EQUAL
 EDUCATION AND OPPORTUNITY AND
 YOU STUNT THEIR CHILDREN'S
 INTELLECTUAL GROWTH BY BUSSING
 THEM TO AN INFERIOR SCHOOL, AND
 YOU'RE GOING TO FILL THEM WITH
 HATRED.
 HE CONTINUED, QUOTE, I DO NOT
 BUY THE CONCEPT POPULAR IN THE
 '60s WHICH SAID WE HAVE
 SUPPRESSED THE BLACK MAN FOR 300
 YEARS AND THE WHITE MAN IS NOW
 FAR AHEAD IN THE RACE FOR
 EVERYTHING OUR SOCIETY OFFERS.
 IN ORDER TO EVEN THE SCORE WE
 MUST NOW GIVE THE BLACK MAN A
 HEAD START OR EVEN HOLD THE
 WHITE MAN BACK TO EVEN THE RACE.
 I DON'T BUY THAT.
 JOINING ME NOW IS CHIEF PUBLIC
 AFFAIRS OFFICER FOR MOVEON.ORG
 AND A FORMER DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR

 PRESIDENT OBAMA'S 2012 CAMPAIGN.
 LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS, BIDEN'S
 SPOKESMAN ON THE BUSSING ISSUE,
 THIS IS A QUOTE FROM BILL RUSSO
 ABOUT "THE WASHINGTON POST"
 ARTICLE.
 HE NEVER THOUGHT BUSSING WAS THE
 BEST WAY TO INTEGRATE SCHOOLS IN
 DELAWARE, A POSITION WHICH MOST
 PEOPLE NOW AGREE WITH.
 AND HE SAID DURING THOSE MANY
 YEARS OF DEBATE THAT BUSSING
 WOULD NOT ACHIEVE EQUAL
 OPPORTUNITY.
 SO IT LOOKS LIKE ON THIS AND ON
 THE CRIME BILL AND OTHER THINGS,
 TEAM BIDEN IS JUST DOUBLING DOWN
 ON WHATEVER HE SAID BEFORE,
 THEY'RE JUST DEFENDING IT.
 IS THAT WISE IN TODAY'S VERSION
 OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY?
 NO, IT IS NOT WISE AT ALL.
 AND FULL DISCLOSURE, I KNOW JOE
 BIDEN WELL AS YOU MENTIONED, I
 WORKED IN THE -I WORKED FOR
 OBAMA ON THE CAMPAIGN, BUT I
 ALSO WORKED IN THE OBAMA
 ADMINISTRATION WHERE I GOT TO
 WORK WITH JOE BIDEN AND LOOK, IT
 IS A COMPLICATED POSITION THAT
 JOE BIDEN IS IN.
 HE IS INCREDIBLY POPULAR.
 PEOPLE REMEMBER HIM FONDLY, AND
 CONNECT JOE BIDEN WITH THE
 SUCCESSES OF OBAMA.
 AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
 THAT WILL HELP HIM IN THE
 PRIMARIES, ESPECIALLY IN A STATE
 LIKE SOUTH CAROLINA.
 WHERE JOE BIDEN IS NOW, HE'S IN
 A SITUATION WHERE THE LAST TIME
 THAT HE RAN ALONE WITHOUT OBAMA
 WAS 12 YEARS AGO, AND NOW HE'S
 GOING TO BE IN A SITUATION WHERE
 HIS 40-YEAR RECORD IS GOING TO
 BE EXAMINED.
 THERE'S GOING TO BE A FRESH NEW
 LOOK AND THINGS LIKE THE CRIME
 BILL, THINGS LIKE ANITA HILL,
 THE HEARING WITH THOMAS,
 CLARENCE THOMAS, IS GOING TO
 COME UP, AND SO THE THING HERE
 IS THAT THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH
 THIS HEAD ON BECAUSE 40 YEARS
 AGO, IT WAS A DIFFERENT TIME.
 WE HAVE MOVED AWAY FROM THAT.
 WE'RE TALKING ABOUT STRUCTURAL
 INEQUALITY.
 WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THINGS THAT
 HAVE REALLY HURT THE BROWN AND
 BLACK COMMUNITY LIKE THE CRIME
 BILL OVER THESE LAST FEW
 DECADES, AND SO THEY NEED TO
 TALK ABOUT HOW THAT WAS A
 MISTAKE.
 THEY NEED TO TALK ABOUT HOW THE
 THINGS THAT HE HAS DONE IN THE
 LAST 15 YEARS THAT DEALT WITH,
 YOU KNOW -THAT HE'S TALKED
 ABOUT CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUES.
 HE'S TALKED ABOUT WOMEN'S
 ISSUES.
 HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO TALK ABOUT
 THAT AS WELL, BUT SAY YOU KNOW
 WHAT, WHERE I WAS 40 YEARS AGO
 WAS A MISTAKE AND TALK ABOUT WHY
 IT WAS A MISTAKE.
 BUT BY DOUBLING DOWN ON THINGS,
 ON RECORDS, ON THINGS THAT HE
 SAID IN 1970s ON THE CRIME BILL
 WHERE HE VOTED ON ANITA HILL IS
 A HUGE MISTAKE.
 DURING THE 2016 CAMPAIGN,
 YOUNG BLACK VOTERS REALLY HELD
 HILLARY CLINTON, WHO WAS FIRST
 LADY AT THE TIME, SHE REALLY GOT
 TAGGED WITH HER COMMENT SUPER
 PREDATORS ABOUT THE CRIME BILL.
 IN THIS CYCLE KAMALA HARRIS IS
 BEING TAGGED BY A LOT -NOT A
 LOT OF, BUT YOU KNOW, SOME
 AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS BECAUSE
 SHE WAS A PROSECUTOR AND
 PROSECUTED PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA
 AND THE WAY THAT THAT OFFICE
 RAN.
 CAN BIDEN -I DON'T KNOW HOW TO
 PUT THIS, BUT BIDEN'S LEGACY
 RIGHT NOW IS OBAMA.
 HIS SUPPORT FOR BARACK OBAMA,
 HIS RIDE OR DIE SUPPORT FOR
 BARACK OBAMA.
 IF HE RUNS, DOES HIS LEGACY THEN
 GET RELITIGATED BY YOUNG VOTERS
 WHO REALLY WEREN'T AROUND DURING
 HIS TENURE IN THE '90s BUT WHO
 WILL NOW LEARN THE THINGS THEY
 LEARNED ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON.
 CLEARLY FOR SOME FOLKS WHO
 DECIDED THEY WERE NOT GOING TO
 JUMP IN, REMEMBER WE HAD THE
 BLACK LIVES MATTER MOVEMENT THAT
 HAPPENED AROUND THAT TIME AND
 LED TO REALLY PLAYING A BIG ROLE
 IN THE PRIMARY OF 2016 AS YOU
 JUST MENTIONED WITH SUPER
 PREDATORS THAT HILLARY CLINTON
 SAID AT FIRST LADY THAT REALLY
 HURT HER IN THAT PRIMARY, AND SO
 WE'RE JUST IN A DIFFERENT TIME,
 JOY, AND YOU CANNOT -YOU
 CANNOT GO BY AND NOT TALK ABOUT
 YOUR RECORD BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING
 TO BE CALLED OUT FOR IT, AND
 THIS IS JUST WHERE WE ARE.
 THERE IS AN ENERGY.
 THERE IS AN ACTIVISM.
 THERE IS A CONVERSATION
 HAPPENING.
 PEOPLE ARE CALLING OUT WHITE
 SUPREMACY, AND WE ALSO HAVE
 DONALD TRUMP WHO'S IN THE WHITE
 HOUSE WHO'S DOING A BUNCH OF
 THINGS THAT HURT, YOU KNOW,
 FRONT LINE COMMUNITIES, SO WE
 NEED CANDIDATES, NOT JUST
 TALKING THE TALK, BUT WALKING
 THE WALKING.
 NOT JUST HAVING LINES ABOUT THE
 COMMUNITY, THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN
 COMMUNITY OR THE BROWN COMMUNITY
 IN THEIR STUMP SPEECH, BUT
 ACTUALLY PUTTING FORTH WHAT ARE
 THEY GOING TO DO, AND HERE'S THE
 THING, JOY, THE REALITY IS YOU
 CANNOT, A DEMOCRAT CANNOT WIN
 THE PRIMARY WITHOUT THE
 AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE.
 THEY CANNOT WIN THE GENERAL
 ELECTION WITHOUT A HIGH TURNOUT
 IN THE BLACK VOTE.
 BLACK COMMUNITY AND WOMEN IN
 PARTICULAR, BLACK WOMEN HOLD THE
 KEY TO THE WHITE HOUSE.
 YEAH.
 AND SORT OF THE REVERSE WAY, ONE
 MIGHT ENVISION SOME
 FIX AN ISSUE THAT CAME UP
 REGARDING PAST ASSOCIATIONS.
 THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT.
 PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE TO DO IT.

 SPECIAL PURPOSE COMMUNICATION TUBES.
 THEY ARE A THING THAT LOOKED
 LIKE THIS.
 THEY DID NOT SEEM TO DO VERY
 MUCH, EVEN THOUGH THESE THREE
 GENTLEMEN ARE MAKING SOME PRETTY
 INTENSE EYE CONTACT WITH THEM.
 THOSE TUBES HAD SOMETHING TO DO
 WITH RADAR TECHNOLOGY.
 THEY WERE MADE BY A COMPANY
 CALLED THE INTERNATIONAL
 TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH COMPANY,
 ITT FOR SHORT.
 THEY TOOK THIS VIDEO WHEN THEY
 OPENED A NEW RADAR TUBE PLANT IN
 VIRGINIA IN THE LATE 1950s, BUT
 ITT WAS NOT JUST A SPECIAL
 PURPOSE COMMUNICATION
 COMMUNICATIONS TUBES COMPANY,
 THEY WERE A HUGE PHONE COMPANY
 IN THEIR DAY, AND IN 1970s, ITT
 WANTED TO GET EVEN BIGGER.
 THEY STARTED GOBBLING UP OTHER
 COMPANIES TO MAKE ONE BIG
 MONSTER CONGLOMERATE AND THEY
 EVENTUALLY WERE SUED FOR IT FOR
 ALLEGEDLY VIOLATING ANTITRUST
 LAWS.
 DURING THE NIXON ADMINISTRATION,
 THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT FILED A
 LAWSUIT AGAINST ITT FOR BULKING
 UP THEIR COMPANY IN A WAY THAT
 POTENTIALLY VIOLATED FEDERAL
 ANTITRUST LAW.
 IT WAS A HUGE ORDEAL FOR ITT,
 BEING SUED BY THE JUSTICE
 DEPARTMENT, UNTIL RICHARD NIXON
 MADE THE WHOLE THING GO AWAY.
 IN WHAT WOUND UP BECOMING KIND
 OF A SIBLING TO THE WATERGATE
 INVESTIGATION, NIXON ORDERED THE
 JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO DROP THE
 ANTITRUST LAWSUIT AGAINST ITT
 AND LET THEM GO AHEAD AND MAKE
 THEIR MEGA COMPANY, AND HE DID
 IT IN EXCHANGE FOR A $400,000
 CHECK FROM ITT WRITTEN OUT TO
 THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
 THE WATERGATE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR
 ARCHIBALD COX SET UP A TASK
 FORCE TO INVESTIGATE THAT PAYOFF
 AND THE ALLEGATION THAT THE
 PRESIDENT LEANED ON THE JUSTICE
 DEPARTMENT TO GET THEM TO DROP A
 LAWSUIT.
 THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR
 REPORTEDLY TURNED UP SO MUCH
 EVIDENCE OF WRONGDOING AROUND
 THE ITT SCANDAL THAT THEY WERE
 PLANNING A PROSECUTION, BUT THEY
 NEVER GOT THE CHANCE.
 RICHARD NIXON, OF COURSE,
 RESIGNED AND WAS PARDONED BEFORE
 HE COULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR
 HIS CONDUCT IN THE OVAL OFFICE.
 NOW, RACHEL HAS TALKED ABOUT
 THIS ON THIS SHOW BEFORE BECAUSE
 THERE IS A LESSON HERE THAT IS
 IMPORTANT.
 THE PRESIDENT CANNOT INTERFERE
 WITH THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.
 THE PRESIDENT IS NOT ALLOWED TO
 LEAN ON OR GIVE ORDERS TO THE
 DOJ ABOUT WHO THEY DO AND DO NOT
 PROSECUTE.
 THAT KIND OF THING IS ILLEGAL.
 WHETHER IT COMES WITH A $400,000
 CHECK FROM THE TELEPHONE COMPANY
 OR NOT.
 HOLD THAT THOUGHT.

 THIS WEEK, JANE MAYER AT "THE NEW YORKER" REPORTED THAT
 IN 2017 THE CURRENT PRESIDENT
 TRIED TO PRESSURE THE JUSTICE
 DEPARTMENT WHEN THEY WERE TRYING
 TO DECIDE WHETHER TO OPEN AN
 ANTITRUST LAWSUIT AGAINST AT&T.
 AT&T WAS TRYING TO MERGE WITH
 TIME WARNER, WHICH OWNS, DRUM
 ROLL, CNN.
 THE PRESIDENT HAS REPEATEDLY
 ATTACKED CNN AT HIS RALLIES AND
 ON TWITTER AND MADE CNN HIS
 NUMBER ONE ENEMY IN THE MEDIA.
 EVEN BEFORE HE WAS ELECTED HE
 SAID THAT HE DID NOT THINK THAT
 THE AT&T/TIME WARNER MERGER
 SHOULD GO THROUGH.
 NOW, MIND YOU, BLOCKING THAT
 MERGER FROM HAPPENING WOULD HAVE
 BEEN REALLY BAD FOR THOSE
 COMPANIES' BUSINESS, BUT DONALD
 TRUMP -FROM DONALD TRUMP'S
 POINT OF VIEW, IT ALSO WOULD
 HAVE BEEN A KIND OF PUNISHMENT
 FOR CNN.
 ACCORDING TO "THE NEW YORKER,"
 DONALD TRUMP AS PRESIDENT
 DEMANDED THAT HIS ADVISERS
 INSTRUCT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
 TO OPEN THAT ANTITRUST
 INVESTIGATION INTO AT&T.
 A ROUNDABOUT WAY OF ORDERING THE
 DOJ TO MEET OUT THAT PUNISHMENT
 AGAINST THE COMPANY THAT OWNS
 CNN BECAUSE HE DOESN'T LIKE THE
 WAY HE'S BEING COVERED.
 THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DID WIND
 UP FILING A LAWSUIT TO BLOCK THE
 AT&T MERGER THAT THE PRESIDENT
 WANTED.
 A CASE THAT THEY EVENTUALLY
 LOST.
 DOJ SAYS THE PRESIDENT HAD NO
 SAY IN THEIR DELIBERATIONS WHEN
 DECIDING WHETHER TO BRING THAT
 SUIT, BUT NOW THAT THE DEMOCRATS
 CONTROL CONGRESS, THEY SAY THEY
 ARE GOING TO FIND OUT FOR SURE.
 DEMOCRATS ON THE HOUSE JUDICIARY
 COMMITTEE HAVE SENT TWO LETTERS,
 ONE TO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
 AND ONE TO THE WHITE HOUSE
 COUNSEL, REQUESTING A TROVE OF
 DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THE
 PRESIDENT AND HIS INVOLVEMENT IN
 THE AT&T/TIME WARNER MERGER.
 THE DOCUMENT REQUEST SPANS A
 TIME PERIOD OF MORE THAN TWO
 YEARS.
