 XI JINPING HERE, THEIR GUY HERE, APPEARED POTUS SAYS, NOPE, I'M
 OUT OF HERE, SEE YOU ON THE 9th
 HOLE
 SO IT'S TAKING LONGER THAN
 EXPECTED BECAUSE THE CHINESE
 WANT TO IRON OUT ALL OF THE
 AGREEMENTS IN WRITING IN DETAIL
 VERY, VERY CAREFULLY BEFORE THEY
 SEND XI JINPING TO A HIGH-STAKES
 FACE-TO-FACE MEETING HERE IN THE
 UNITED STATES.
 EAMON JAVERS IN D.C
 MIKE, ON A WEEK WHERE WE HAVE
 OPTIMISM ON THAT DEAL AT LEAST
 NOT IMPROVE, WE'RE DOWN 2% FOR
 THE WEEK.
 THE MARKET MAY BE LOSING A
 LITTLE BIT OF PATIENT RIGHT NOW,
 BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS WE'RE DOWN
 2% SO MAYBE WE HAVE NO LONGER
 PRICED IN A GOOD SCENARIO.
 THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT THE
 MARKET WOULD SPIKE ON A TRADE
 DEAL TODAY.
 THANKS FOR WATCHING TODAY AND
 ALL WEEK
 THAT DOES IT FOR "CLOSING BELL."
 HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND.
 SARA, "FAST MONEY" DOES
 BEGIN RIGHT NOW LIVE FROM THE
 NASDAQ MARKET SITE
 I'M SCOTT WAPNER IN TONIGHT FOR
 MELISSA LEE.
 TONIGHT WE HAVE THE CEO OF
 TAKETWO ENTERTAINMENT, STRAUSS
 ZELNICK HERE TO TALK ABOUT HIS
 BIG PUSH INTO E-SPORTS AS THEY
 HOSTED THEIR DRAFT THIS WEEK
 WE DO START WITH THE GLOBAL
 GROWTH FEARS GRIPPING WALL
 STREET
 THE DOW DOWN 200 POINTS AT THE
 LOWS
 REBOUNDED NICELY AT THE CLOSE.
 CHINA GOT SLAMMED OVERNIGHT, THE
 U.S. ADDED ONLY 20,000 JOBS IN
 FEBRUARY, WORST WEEK OF THE YEAR
 FOR STOCKS, AS WE MARK THE
 TEN-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE BULL
 MARKET
 CAME CLOSE TO DYING THIS FALL.
 AS GROWTH SLOWS AROUND THE
 GLOBE, THE BULL LOOKS LIKE IT
 COULD BE IN FOR ANOTHER BEAR
 SCARE.
 HOW WORRIED SHOULD INVESTORS BE?
 TIM, I LEAD YOU WITH THAT
 BREAKING NEWS THAT THESE TRADE
 TALKS ARE TAKING LONGER THAN
 EXPECTED
 WHO COULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT?
 WELL, I THINK I HEAR SOME
 SARCASM, SCOTT
 IF YOU THROW TRADE DYSFUNCTION
 INTO THE MIDDLE OF A MARKET
 GETTING GROWTH SIGNALS THAT ARE
 VERY DIFFICULT, HEADLINE ON
 TODAY'S PAYROLL NUMBER WAS
 SHOCKING
 IF YOU LOOK BELOW THE SURFACE,
 IT WASN'T THAT BAD
 THERE ARE SOME IRREGULARITY THE
 IN THE DATA FLOW THE LAST COUPLE
 OF MONTHS.
 THE CHINESE DATA, SHOULD WE BE
 SURPRISED THEIR EXPORTS FELL
 THE LAST SEVEN DAYS WE'VE SEEN
 CREDIT BEGIN TO DETERIORATE.
 WHAT WAS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
 THE PULL-BACK IN OCTOBER AND
 DECEMBER FROM THAT EARLIER IN
 THE YEAR
 IT WAS THAT WE SAW CDX, CREDIT,
 WHATEVER YOU WANT TO MEASURE,
 LOOK AT THE HYG IS ONE WAY TO DO
 IT
 BOTTOM LINE, THE MARKET CLOSED
 ON THE HIGHS AND THAT'S VERY
 IMPRESSIVE
 IN FACT I THINK THAT CHANGED
 SENTIMENT A LOT.
 DANNY, WHAT ARE WE TO MAKE OF
 THAT BREAKING NEWS
 THIS MORNING IT LOOKS LIKE
 INVESTORS WERE TAKING ALL THE
 GROWTH FEARS AND ALL THE
 POTENTIAL FOR A PUSHED-OUT DEAL
 PRETTY SERIOUSLY
 CRUDE OIL WAS DOWN 3.5%.
 THE 10-YEAR TREASURY YIELD
 ALMOST TOUCHED 2.60.
 NIKKEI DOWN 2%
 THAT SEEMED LIKE RISK ALL KIND
 OF STUFF
 WE HAD THIS SLOW BURN UP SINCE
 THE DECEMBER LOWS.
 I THINK TIM IS 100% RIGHT.
 THE FACT THAT WE ONLY CLOSED
 DOWN 20 IN THE S&P AND CRUDE
 MADE UP A LOT OF ROOM, THE FACT
 THE 10-YEAR TREASURY YIELD DID
 NOT CLOSE SITTING ON THAT
 TECHNICAL LEVEL, I THINK IT'S
 OKAY
 THAT BEING SAID, I JUST DON'T
 KNOW WHAT THE CATALYSTS ARE
 RIGHT NOW.
 I THINK IT WAS MORE A
 QUESTION ABOUT GOING INTO THE
 WEEKEND WITHOUT A CHINA DEAL
 THAT'S DONE.
 MAYBE THERE WAS A RISK TO THE
 UPSIDE
 YOU KNOW THERE'S GOING TO BE A
 LAST GASP BOUNCE ONCE THEY GET A
 CHINA DEAL.
 MAYBE
 I THINK IT'S BEEN A
 LEGITIMATE QUESTION --
 I THINK YOU'LL GET IT, IT'S
 HOW LONG LASTING WILL IT BE, HOW
 QUICK WILL IT BE SOLD.
 COMING FROM THIS LEVEL I DON'T
 THINK IT'S GOING TO BE THAT
 AGGRESSIVE
 NONETHELESS, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
 SELL IT A WEEKEND AHEAD OF A
 POTENTIAL DEAL.
 YOU HAD THAT FLARE-UP IN THE
 LOW, THE GAP IN THE FUTURES WAS
 EXCEEDINGLY RARE AND WE'VE BEEN
 DOWN SINCE
 HOW MUCH IS THIS
 MAYBE THE SELL-OFF AND RECOVERY
 NEGATE EACH OTHER AND WE'RE
 BASICALLY WHERE WE WERE IN
 OCTOBER SINCE THINGS STARTED
 GETTING QUESTIONING AND SINCE
 ALL THE DATA HAS GOTTEN WORSE.
 ZERO GROWTH
 I KNOW TIM BRINGS UP GREAT
 POINTS ABOUT WHY IT'S NOT AS
 NEGATIVE AS IT SEEMS TO ME OR ON
 THIS SIDE OF THE DESK, I DON'T
 WANT TO SPEAK FOR YOU, BUT
 THERE'S ZERO GROWTH BASICALLY IN
 GERMANY.
 ITALY IS IN RECESSION.
 THERE'S NO GROWTH IN JAPAN
 THE ECB PROBABLY OVERESTIMATED
 WHEREVER THEY THINK GDP IS GOING
 TO BE.
 THE ECB IS OUT OF BULLETS.
 JAPAN IS OUT OF BULLETS.
 EVERYONE IS OUT OF BULLETS
 EXEMPT FOR US, AND WE DON'T HAVE
 THAT MANY BULL ETS IN CASE OF A
 DOWNTURN
 I THINK THAT THE MARKET IS
 HAVING A DAY OF RECKONING.
 IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT THIS
 WEEK, THIS WAS A BEARISH
 REVERSAL WEEK.
 I THINK WE'VE BEEN LEADING TO
 THIS FOR A LONG TIME
 CARTER SAYS WE'RE BACK TO WHERE
 WE WERE.
 ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE SAID AND
 I SAID THIS IN THE FALL, I THINK
 Q1 2019 COULD BE Q1 2016-LIKE.
 I THINK WE GOT OUR MARKET
 DISLOCATION A LITTLE BEFORE
 THIS
 SO TEND TO AGREE WITH WHAT
 CARTER SAID, BUT I JUST DON'T
 SEE THE DATA FALLING APART THAT
 QUICKLY.
 AGAIN, LET'S TALK ABOUT U.S.
 DATA
 ALTHOUGH THIS IS A TERRIBLE
 HEADLINE PRINT --
 IT'S PROBABLY AN ANOMALY.
 THE MARKET OBVIOUSLY IS PLACING
 ITS BETS.
 THE CONSUMER IS NOT DEAD.
 YEAH, BUT TIM, HERE'S THE
 THING.
 THE DATA IS NOT GOOD AND IT'S
 NOT GETTING BETTER IN CHINA AND
 IT'S NOT GOOD AND IT'S NOT
 GETTING BETTER IN EUROPE
 THE THING THAT I WOULD BE
 WORRIED ABOUT AFTER THIS STRONG
 REFLEX IS WE GET INTO MID-APRIL
 AND START HAVING Q1 EARNINGS AND
 FORWARD GUIDANCE AND SEE REALLY
 LIGHT GUIDANCE
 THAT'S THE SORT OF THING THAT I
 THINK WOULD REALLY SHAKE MARKET
 PARTICIPANTS.
 HAVEN'T WE RESET GUIDANCE A
 BIT?
 IT SEEMS LIKE NO ONE IS
 EXPECTING ANYTHING ANYMORE
 THEY'RE NOT WORRIED BECAUSE
 THE RICOCHET DREW IN A LOT OF
 MONEY AND EMBOLDENED PEOPLE TO
 THINK IT NEVER HAPPENED, THE
 DECEMBER THING WASN'T REAL, AND
 WE KNOW IT WAS REAL.
 THE CONVERSATIONS THAT I HAVE
 WITH ACTIVE MONEY MANAGERS AND
 PIERS ON THE STREET IS THAT
 PEOPLE ARE NOT DOING WELL IN
 THIS MARKET.
 I UNDERSTAND --
 I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE
 COMPLACENT IS MY POINT.
 I UNDERSTAND THE ANALOGY TO
 2015-16 BUT WE WERE IN A GLOBAL
 EASING ENVIRONMENT BACK IN
 2015-16, ESPECIALLY IN THE
 EUROZONE
 WHERE ARE THEY GOING TO BE
 EASING FROM?
 WHERE ARE THEY GOING TO EASE
 FROM
 THEY DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY.
 ACTUALLY, STEVE, WE STARTED
 TIGHTENING
 THE FED'S FIRST RATE HIKE WAS IN
 DECEMBER.
 BUT THAT'S OFF THE TABLE.
 BUT THE FED WAS GOING TO PUSH
 THE WORLD INTO A GLOBAL
 RECESSION.
 THIS IS THE EXACT SAME
 CONDITIONS.
 BUT EUROPE, THIS IS THE MAIN
 CONCERN WHERE EVERYONE, EVEN
 PEOPLE THAT SAY THEY'RE BEARISH
 SAY THEY'RE MORE BULLISH ON
 AMERICA VERSUS EUROPE, BUT
 EUROPE WAS ON A STRING OF EASING
 FOR FOUR YEARS AND IT GOT THEM
 NO PLACE
 THE KEY DATA POINT IN THE
 PA
 MARKET IS THERE'S ONE SECTOR
 THAT'S MAKING ALL-TIME HIGHS
 WELL, TWO.
 S&P MIDCAP UTILITIES AND S&P

 I WAS GOING TO BRING UP THE
 FACT THAT YOU HAVE THE
 TRANSPORTS AND THE RUSSELL
 NOW, THE RUSSELL HAD A NICE
 COMEBACK TODAY ALONG WITH
 EVERYTHING ELSE, BUT THE TREND
 IS NOT YOUR FRIEND IF YOU'RE
 LOOKING AT DOW THEORY THROUGH
 TRANSPORTS AND SMALL CAPS LEADS
 YOU DOWN, LEADS YOU UP
 THEY'RE NOT PERFORMING WELL.
 SMALL CAPS HAVE LED US HERE
 AND THE SEMIS WERE THE FIRST TO
 ROLL
 MAYBE IT'S LIKE IT WAS BACK IN
 JUNE, LET'S WAIT AND SEE
 FOLKS, IS THERE ANY SURPRISE,
 MARKETS HAVE DONE NOTHING FOR 15
 MONTHS
 I MEAN THIS ISN'T REALLY -WITH
 A LOT OF VOLATILITY IN BETWEEN
 SO I APPRECIATE THE FACT WE'RE
 ALL GNASHING OUR TEETH RIGHT
 NOW.
 IF YOU SAY OKAY, WE CANCELLED
 OURSELVES OUT, DECEMBER DOWN,
 NOW WE'RE UP
 NOW ARE WE AT THE INFLECTION
 POINT?
 YOU NEED SOMETHING DRAMATIC TO
 HAPPEN --
 EPS GOING NEGATIVE, MARGINS
 HAVE PEAKED AND GDP IS FALLING
 IS THAT A SPOT YOU WANT TO PUT
 NEW MONEY TO WORK?
 THE DIXIE OR DOLLAR INDEX
 ALMOST BROKE OUT TO A 52-WEEK
 HIGH
 IF IT WERE TO DO THAT AT A TIME
 COMMODITY PRICES ARE PRETTY
 FIRM, SO THAT COMBINATION TO ME
 WITH RATES GOING DOWN FOR THE
 WRONG REASONS, NOT A GREAT
 COMBINATION FOR STOCKS RIGHT
 NOW.
 JUST AS WE GET SET THIS
 WEEKEND TO MARK THE 10-YEAR
 ANNIVERSARY OF THE BULL MARKET,
 THIS CONVERSATION IS WONDERING
 WHEN IT'S GOING TO END
 THE MARKETS ARE BATTLING SOME
 KEY TECHNICAL LEVELS
 DON'T WORRY, THE CHART MASTER
 WILL TELL US WHAT IT ALL MEANS
 WHY DON'T YOU GO TO THE PLASMA
 AND SHOW US.
 ON THE WAY TO THE PLASMA,
 LET'S NOTE THAT THE NASDAQ
 COMPOSITE DROPPED 24%, THE S&P
 DROPPED MORE THAN 20%.
 WE'VE HAD A BEAR MARKET.
 NOW THE QUESTION IS WHETHER
 WE'RE RECOVERING AND GOING TO
 MAKE NEW HIGHS OR THIS IMPETUOUS
 BOUNCE IS JUST THAT, A BOUNCE.
 NO LINES OR DRAWINGS BY ME
 LET'S PUT IN A FEW AND SEE WHAT
 WE CAN FIGURE OUT.
 HERE'S A CHART OF THE S&P.
 WHAT WE KNOW IS, AGAIN, WHILE
 THE 2800 LEVEL IS CITED, THAT'S
 NOT THE LEVEL THAT HAS MATTERED
 FOR THE MARKET
 WE'VE HAD THREE WELL-DEFINED
 INTERMEDIATE TOPS.

 THE MARKET HIT THAT LEVEL
 EXACTLY LAST WEEK AFTER NEWS ON
 THE TRADE FRONT AND HAS PIVOTED
 STRAIGHT DOWN.
 WE KNOW THE TRANSPORTS JUST HAD
 A RECORD SEQUENCE OF LOSSES.
 AND SO IS IT JUST A BOUNCE
 A COUPLE OF WAYS TO DRAW THE
 LINES.
 ON THE WAY UP WE HAVE HAD FOUR
 DISTINCT PULLBACKS
 THERE WAS A 3%, THIS WAS 2.3,
 THIS IS 2.1 AND THIS IS 3.1.
 THE BULL WOULD SAY THAT'S JUST A
 NORMAL GIVE-BACK AND WE'RE ON
 OUR WAY TO DOING THINGS LIKE
 THAT
 MY HUNCH IS OTHERWISE.
 I THINK ULTIMATELY WE STILL HAVE
 A LOT OF RISK TO THE DOWNSIDE
 AND AT A MINIMUM WE'RE LIKELY TO
 FIND A REFERENCE POINT AS WE
 FOUND BEFORE HERE, JUST AS WE
 HAD REFERENCE POINTS AT THE HIGH
 AT 2800.
 AND THAT A NORMAL CHECK BACK IS
 NOT GOING TO BE 3% AFTER
 ADVANCING 20, BUT IT'S MORE LIKE
 7, 8, 9, WHICH WOULD GET US DOWN
 TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS CHANNEL.
 AND I THINK THAT ULTIMATELY IS
 WHAT HAS TO BE CONSIDERED BEFORE
 ONE COULD THINK ABOUT PUTTING
 MONEY TO WORK BECAUSE WE'VE
 DIPPED
 WE HAVEN'T DIPPED AT ALL
 WE'VE GONE DOWN 3% AND THAT IS
 NOTHING.
 SO, CARTER, I THOUGHT THAT WE
 WERE GOING TO RECHECK THOSE LOWS
 THAT WE SAW, THE 2350 RANGE.
 I AGREE WITH YOU, I THINK IT'S
 MORE LIKE 5% OR 7% DOWN FROM
 HERE
 IS THERE ANY SHOT IN YOUR MIND,
 I KNOW THERE'S ALWAYS A SHOT, SO
 HOW CREDIBLE IS ANOTHER SHOT
 DOWN TO 2350
 I THINK IT'S THE BEST BET YOU
 CAN MAKE
 THIS IS A MINIMUM.
 THE REAL QUESTION IS DO WE --
 NOW, IT'S IMPORTANT, PEOPLE USE
 THE WORD "RETEST."
 IT WOULD BE A TEST
 IF YOU HAVE A LOW AND YOU GO
 BACK THERE YOU'RE TESTING IT
 IF YOU GO BACK A SECOND TIME,
 YOU'RE RETESTING IT.
 DO WE TEST THE LOWS?
 I THINK WE DO.
 THE BEST BET WE CAN MAKE IS
 THAT WE'RE GOING BACK TO RETEST
 THE LOWS
 THAT'S WHAT I JUST HEARD YOU
 SAY?
 SURE.
 THAT'S A LITTLE UNSETTLING ON
 THIS FRIDAY EVENING.
 REMEMBER, THE MARKET DIDN'T
 PEAK IN SEPTEMBER, OCTOBER
 THAT WAS A FAKE NEW HIGH
 INDUSTRIALS PEAKED IN JANUARY OF

 CARTER --
 MATERIALS PEAKED IN '18,
 ENERGY PEAKED.
 IT WAS ONLY THE S&P, BECAUSE
 FAANG HAD THAT HEAD FAKE, GLOBAL
 EQUITIES, ALL OF THEM ALL PEAKED
 OVER A YEAR AGO AND THEY HAVE
 NEVER GOTTEN BETTER.
 CARTER, WE TALK FUNDAMENTALS
 SO LET'S JUST TALK CHARTS
 BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE THERE
 TO DO.
 I CAN DO BOTH IF YOU'D LIKE.
 WE'VE SEEN THIS V BEFORE.
 DOES HE LOOK LIKE A ONE-TRICK
 PONY TO YOU?
 CARTER, IF I WAS GOING TO
 DRAFT A TEAM RIGHT NOW, HE WOULD
 BE THE BEST PERSON AVAILABLE IF
 I MISSPOKE
 HAVEN'T WE SEEN THIS V BEFORE,
 CARTER
 WE'VE SEEN Vs OF 5%, OF 7%
 THESE HAVEN'T BEEN Ws, THEY HAVE
 BEEN Vs.
 I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH A
 CLIENT ABOUT THAT TODAY.
 I THINK THAT'S A FAIR POINT.
 WELL, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
 THIS KIND OF THING HOW MANY REAL
 Vs ARE THERE IN TERMS OF
 DRAWDOWNS IN THE S&P OF 15%,

 WE KNOW THIS WAS HISTORIC
 I'M NOT SAYING THIS IS LIKE
 ANYTHING WE'VE SEEN.
 BUT I'M SAYING IN THE LAST TEN
 YEARS, WE'VE SEEN THESE MOMENTS
 WHERE THE MARKET HAS BEEN RIGHT
 HERE ON A PROPORTIONATE BASIS
 LOWER, BUT CLEARLY A MOMENT
 WHERE WE THOUGHT THIS WAS IT.
 YEAH.
 AGAIN, I WOULD SAY LOOK AT THE
 MESSAGE OF UTILITIES,THE FACT
 RATES ARE DOING WHAT THEY'RE
 DOING, FINANCIALS ARE NOT
 WORKING AND THAT WORSE THAN
 ANYTHING, IT WAS TOO STEEP
 IF WE SPENT SOME TIME HEALING
 AFTER THE CHRISTMAS LOW AND
 WORKING THROUGH IT, THE FACT
 THAT IT HAPPENED SO QUICKLY IS
 NOT A POSITIVE, IT'S A NEGATIVE.
 IT SPEAKS TO FRANKLY A PANIC
 THERE WAS A PANIC IN DECEMBER
 AND AN EQUAL AND OPPOSITE PANIC
 NOW AS MONEY AGGRESSIVELY TRIES
 TO CATCH UP.
 AND YET THAT MONEY THAT DROVE US
 HIGHER IN JANUARY, FEBRUARY CAN
 BECOME AN ACCELERANT ON THE WAY
 BACK DOWN AS IT HAS TO REVERSE.
 YOU'RE DISPUTING THE FACT
 THAT YOU THINK THIS IS SIMPLY A
 BEAR MARKET BOUNCE
 YOU THINK THIS IS A JITTERY
 VER --
 LEGITIMATE REVERSAL?
 I THINK WE PUT IN AN EXTREME
 DOWNTREND AND AN EXTREME UPTREND
 AND CANCELLED THEM OUT
 THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE FED DID.
 I REALIZE EARNINGS AREN'T SEXY
 AND THE GLOBAL ECONOMY IS NOT IN
 GREAT SHAPE.
 WE'VE BEEN IN A PLACE WHERE
 EQUITIES HAVE PERFORMED IN THAT
 ENVIRONMENT.
 COMING UP, ENERGY IS DOWN
 MORE THAN 2%
 ONE OF THE TRADERS THINKS IT'S
 ABOUT TO GET A LOT WORSE
 HE'LL TELL US HOW HE'S PLAYING
 THE CRUDE CRUSH COMING UP.
 PLUS GAMING GIANT TAKE TWO
 IS HOSTING ITS GAMING LEAGUE

 WHY HE IS GOING ALL IN ON THE

 CHECK OUT SHAERES OF NETFLIX
 GETTING HIT TODAY DOWN NEARLY 3%
 AFTER A DOWNGRADE FROM BUY TO
 NEUTRAL AT BUCKINGHAM RESEARCH
 THEY DID KEEP THEIR PRICE TARGET
 INTACT BUT THEY'RE LOOKING AT
 INCREASED COMPETITION, WHICH I
 THINK EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT
 STORY.
 SUSCEPTIBLE TO JUST A GENERAL
 MARKET DOWNTURN.
 RIGHT
 SO RIGHT NOW THEY'RE BASICALLY
 RAISING PRICES, LOSING CONTENT,
 SPENDING MORE MONEY.
 THAT'S THE NEGATIVE STORY,
 THAT'S THE HEADWIND.
 I DO BELIEVE IF THE OVERALL
 MARK, WHICH I THINK IS GOING TO
 SELL OFF, NETFLIX HAS TO IN
 THEORY SELL OFF.
 SO YOU AGREE WITH THAT
 CRITICAL POINT THAT THEY MAKE.
 I AGREE WITH THAT PREMISE BUT
 LONGER TERM I THINK PEOPLE WILL
 HAVE A BUNDLE THEMSELVES OF
 STOCK THAT THEY BUY.
 THEY'LL BUY THE DISNEY, THEY'LL
 BUY THIS ONE AND BUY TWO OR
 THREE OTHER ONES
 THEY'LL PROBABLY SPENT 40 OR
 SOME ODD DOLLARS COLLECTIVELY
 WITH ALL THE STREAMINGS THAT
 THEY DO BUY.
 I THINK THEY'LL HAVE
 COMPETITION.
 THERE'S ROOM FOR THEM.
 BUT YES, I GET THE BEAR STORY ON
 NETFLIX.
 THE TRUTH IS THEY'LL SPEND A
 LOT MORE THAN $40.
 YOUR BILLS ON THIS WILL LOOK
 LIKE YOUR CABLE BILL CIRCA 2009
 AND THEN YOU'LL SEE ALL THIS
 STUFF REBUNDLED.
 HERE'S THE BIG ISSUE WITH
 NETFLIX RIGHT NOW.
 YOU CAN SAY, OH, THAT PRICE
 INCREASE WENT REALLY WELL AND
 DON'T WORRY.
 THEY LOST $3 BILLION IN FREE
 CASH FLOW LAST YEAR AND GUIDED
 JUST A COUPLE MONTHS AGO TO LOSE
 ANOTHER $3 BILLION
 AT SOME POINT IF WE ARE GETTING
 TO THE END OF A CYCLE ESPECIALLY
 WITH ALL THIS COMPETITION, THIS
 STOCK WILL NOT BE ABLE TO
 LEVITATE.
 THE STOCK IS BASICALLY FLAT
 YEAR OVER YEAR
 NOTHING, NOTHING, WITH A LOT OF
 VOLATILITY.
 COMING UP, THE CEO OF
 TAKETWO SAYS E-SPORTS ARE ABOUT
 TO GET BIGGER AND BIGGER AND
 BETTER THAN EVER
 WE'LL TELL YOU WHY HE SAYS WE'RE
 NOWHERE CLOSE TO REACHING PEAK
 GAMING
 WE'RE LIVE FROM TIMES SQUARE IN
 NEW YORK CITY TONIGHT.
 THERE IS MUCH MORE "FAST MONEY"
 RIGHT AFTER THIS
 WE'RE PACK ON "FAST MONEY. GAME ON IS A COMPETITIVE VIDEO
 GAME LEAGUE.
 IT HAD ITS SECOND DRAFT AT THE
 BARCLAY CENTER IN BROOKLYN
 74 MEN, 1 WOMAN JOINED TEAMS TO
 LIVE A LIFE SOME NOW DREAM OF,
 PLAYING VIDEO GAMES
 PROFESSIONALLY AS E-SPORTS
 ATHLETES
 WITH US NOW THE MAN, THE MYTH
 AND THE GAMING LEGEND HIMSELF.
 TAKETWO CEO STRAUSS ZELNICK.
 THAT'S A BIG BUILDUP
 BARCLAY CENTER IS HUGE
 IT'S UNBELIEVABLE THE GROWTH IN
 THESE SPORTS.
 IT'S GREAT.
 IT'S OUR SECOND SEASON
 THE FIRST SEASON ENDED WITH A
 GREAT RESULT AND EVERYONE IS
 LOOKING FORWARD TO THE SECOND
 TIP-OFF.
 WHAT'S THE AVERAGE AGE OF
 THOSE WHO COMPETE?
 THE COMPETITORS ARE ON THE
 YOUNG SIDE SO I'D SAY PROBABLY
 EARLY TO MID-20s
 IN TERMS OF PEOPLE WHO WATCH,
 ALL ACROSS THE MAP
 MORE THAN 250 MILLION PEOPLE
 WORLDWIDE CONSIDER E-SPORTS AN
 IMPORTANT FORM OF ENTERTAINMENT.
 ABOUT 125 MILLION OF THEM ARE
 AVID E-SPORTS WATCHERS.
 AND SPORTS ARE STILL A BIG
 DEAL WITH KIDS PLAYING GAMES, AS
 FORTNITE HAS OBVIOUSLY
 SKYROCKETED.
 MY OWN SON IS STILL PLAYING THE
 HOCKEY GAMES, THE BASKETBALL
 GAMES AND MADDEN.
 BASKETBALL, GOOD.
 GOOD TO HEAR IT.
 2K OBVIOUSLY.
 BUT SERIOUSLY, THOSE ARE STILL
 POPULAR EVEN IN THE GROWTH OF
 THESE OTHER TITLES.
 WE'RE HAVING A RECORD YEAR
 WITH NBA 2K.
 ONE OF THE THINGS WE LOVE IS
 WHEN THERE ARE MORE HITS IN THE
 MARKET, THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE
 ENGAGED, THE ENTIRE MARKET
 GROWS.
 SO WE'RE GOING TO TELL MORE
 UNITS THIS YEAR THAN EVER
 BEFORE
 WE'LL HAVE HIGHER RECURRENT
 CONSUMER SPENDING THAN EVER
 BEFORE
 IT'S A NEW RECORD.
 IT'S A TIME SOME OF OUR
 COMPETITORS ARE ALSO DOING WELL.
 TALK ABOUT FORTNITE AND APEX
 AND COMPETITION AND WHAT YOU
 THINK ABOUT THAT
 I'M SURE AS YOU SAID, YOU SEE
 THE TRENDS FOR YOU ARE GREAT
 WE THINK THAT FORTNITE IS A
 GREAT THING FOR THE INDUSTRY
 IT'S PROBABLY BROUGHT IN A
 SOMEWHAT YOUNGER CONSUMER.
 I'M OFTEN ASKED IS THAT
 SOMETHING THAT'S HURT US
 TO THE CONTRARY, NO, WE'VE SEEN
 THE MARKET CONTINUE TO GROW.
 AT THE SAME TIME FORTNITE HAS
 BEEN AN EXTRAORDINARY HIT FOR
 EPIC, WE HAD ANOTHER GREAT YEAR
 FOR GRAND THEFT AUTO LAST YEAR,
 WE HAD A RECORD QUARTER FOR ROCK
 STAR GAMES
 WE SOLD MORE THAN 23 MILLION
 UNITS OF RED DEAD RESEDEMPTION
 YOU JUST MENTIONED UNITS AND
 THAT'S WHAT YOUR TYPICAL
 INVESTORS, THEY KIND OF
 UNDERSTAND THAT FOR A GAME
 MAKER.
 HOW ARE YOU MONETIZING THIS NEW
 E-SPORTS.
 THE BIGGEST REVENUE STREAM IS
 WHAT WE CALL RECURRENT CONSUMER
 SPENDING, WHICH IS EVERY FORM OF
 NET BOOKINGS THAT ISN'T A FULL
 GAME SALE.
 OUR GOAL IS EVERY TIME WE PUT
 OUT A TITLE, WE HAVE AN
 OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO
 ENGAGE WITH THAT TITLE OVER A
 PERIOD OF TIME
 IF CONSUMERS DO ENGAGE, THEY CAN
 MONETIZE THAT ENGAGEMENT
 THAT CAN BE IN-GAME SPENDING,
 DOWNLOADABLE ADD-ON CONTENT OR
 THE LIKE
 THAT'S OUR BIGGEST OPPORTUNITY
 AND THAT'S A QUARTER OF OUR
 BUSINESS IN THE LAST QUARTER
 IN ADDITION, YOU MENTIONED
 E-SPORTS AND IT'S TIMELY BECAUSE
 WE JUST HAD THE DRAFT.
 THAT LOOKS TO BE BREAKING THE
 BILLION DOLLAR MARK IN TERMS OF
 THE INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE.
 REMEMBER, MOST OF THAT STILL
 GOES TO LEAGUE OF LEGENDS, WHICH
 IS NOT ONE OF OUR TITLES
 WE HAVE A COUPLE OF COMPETITORS
 WHO ARE DOING WELL
 OVERWATCH IS DOING WELL.
 NBA 2K IS THE ONE TO WATCH.
 HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT ADD-ON
 CONTENT WITH YOUR AAA TITLES IN
 LIGHT OF FORTNITE?
 IS IT THE MICROTRANSACTIONS HOW
 YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT ADDING
 CONTENT IN
 MICROTRANSACTIONS FOUR YOU, IS
 THAT THE HIGHEST OPPORTUNITY
 MICROTRANSACTIONS IS
 SPENDING
 WHAT WE FOCUS ON IS MAKING THE
 HIGHEST QUALITY ENTERTAINMENT
 AND ENGAGING OUR CUSTOMER.
 IF WE GET THAT RIGHT, MO
 MONETIZATION FOLLOWS.
 TAKETWO, DO YOU WANT TO TRADE
 IT TIMMY
 I'M LONG THE STOCK.
 IT'S BEEN A TOUGH RUN.
 WE'RE AT A PLACE IN VALUATION,
 IT'S COMPELLING RELATIVE TO
 ITSELF FOR SURE, BUT TRADING
 JUST SOUTH OF 30 TIMES WITH TOP
 LINE GROWTH THAT FRANKLY SEEMS
 TO BE SOMEWHAT STAGNANT.
 I'M A BIG BELIEVER IN THIS
 INDUSTRY
 I THINK THE VALUATIONS WILL MAKE
 SOME OF THESE NAMES START TO
 LOOK PRETTY ATTRACTIVE TO MEDIA
 COMPANIES.
 AS STRAUSS POINTED OUT, THIS IS
 AN E-SPORTS WATCHING STORY
 GLOBALLY.
 AND THEY BOTH GOT HIT.
 ALL OF THEM
 ALL OF THEM GOT HIT.
 TO TIMMY'S POINT, THIS ONE GOT
 HIT THE HARDEST.
 IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A REBOUND
 EFFECT OR SOME TYPE OF
 REVERSION, I WOULD THINK THAT
 THIS IS THE NAME THAT YOU'RE
 GOING TO GET IN.
 HERE'S THE THING.
 SO REVENUES ARE STAGNANT, THE
 STOCK ALMOST GOT CUT IN HALF IN
 THE LAST SIX, SEVEN MONTHS SINCE
 THE ALL-TIME HIGHS
 WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT TRADING AT
 3.5 TIMES SALES, THIS LOOKS LIKE
 A VALUABLE AND UNDERAPPRECIATED
 ASSET BECAUSE IT IS SCARCE
 THERE IS ONLY ONE NBA 2K LEAGUE.
 IF YOU THINK ABOUT ALL THE
 OPPORTUNITIES THAT WILL EMERGE
 FROM THIS E-SPORTS PHENOMENON --
 I'M A GRAND THEFT AUTO GUY.
 I HAVE NOTICE THAT HE HAD
 SOME KIDS WHO GOT ALL IN ON
 FORTNITE HAVE GRAVITATED BACK
 TOWARDS THE SPORTS GAMES
 NOT ONLY MY OWN SON BUT HIM AND
 HIS FRIENDS WHERE IT WAS ONLY
 FORTNITE AND NOW IT'S BACK TO
 THE SPORTS GAMES
 MAYBE THEY'RE TRANSTORRE.
 I THINK ARE CONCERNED ABOUT
 THAT.
 TIME FOR FINAL TRADES
 TIM, YOU'RE UP PUT.
 UNH, GET LONG.
 UTILITIES, XLU.
 MR. GRASSO.
 GE.
 XLE, SELLG INIT.
 OPTIONS ACTION STARTS RIGHT
 AFTER THIS BREAK
 DON'T GO ANYWHERE.
