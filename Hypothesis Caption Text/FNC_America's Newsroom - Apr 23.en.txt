      So in this commercial
       we see two travelers         at a Comfort INN
     with a glow around them,
        so people watching          will be like,
    “Wow, maybe I'll glow too
       if I book direct at        ChoiceHotels.com”.
            Who glows?
      Just say, Badda Book.           Badda Boom.

 MEANWHILE THIS STORY.
 MR. GERAGOS AND THE OTHER

 THE CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS.
 WE HOPE THEY FOLLOW OUR LEAD
 AND ACT DIGNIFIED DURING THIS
 LAWSUIT.
 I WILL TELL YOU THIS, THE
 SCORCHED EARTH LAWYERING WILL
 NOT PLAY OUT IN THE UNITED
 STATES DISTRICT COURT IN
 CHICAGO.
 Sandra: WE WATCHED THAT
 TOGETHER MOMENTS AGO IN CHICAGO.
 ATTORNEYS FOR THE TWO BROTHERS
 ANNOUNCING A DEFAMATION SUIT
 AGAINST THE LEGAL TEAM
 JUSSIE SMOLLETT.
 THE BROTHERS DESERVE TO HAVE
 THEIR REPUTATIONS CLEARED.
 I'M SURE YOU WERE WATCHING THAT
 ALONG WITH ALL OF US.
 WHAT DID YOU THINK WHEN YOU SAW
 THAT, NOW THE BROTHERS FILING
 SUIT AGAINST SMOLLETT'S LEGAL
 TEAM?
 ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS
 TROUBLING IS THIS CASE NEVER
 WENT TO COURT.
 SO THEY WANT TO HAVE THEIR
 NAMES D.
 THEY WANT TO SEE JUSTICE SERVED.
 THEY WANT TO HAVE THE TRUTH
 COME OUT SO THAT THE PEOPLE OF
 CHICAGO AND THE PEOPLE OF COOK
 COUNTY KNOW WHAT ACTUALLY
 OCCURRED.
 AND SO I KNOW JUSSIE SMOLLETT'S
 ATTORNEYS HAVE DONE EVERYTHING
 THEY COULD TO KEEP THIS OUT OF
 THE COURTROOM.
 WE CERTAINLY HAVE A PROBLEM
 IN COOK COUNTY BECAUSE THE
 STATE'S ATTORNEY HAS DROPPED
 ALL CHARGES.
 LEADS TO %OTHER PROBLEMS.
 AND WE CERTAINLY ENCO
 WANTING TO GET TO /TRUTH AND
 TO GET PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND

 OUTSTANDING JOB OF
 INVESTIGATING THIS CASE AND
 BRINGING ITFORW[í/ /
 AND I /4/THE COURT
 CASE WHERE WE CAN FIND OUT AND
 THE PEOPLE OF CHICAGO CAN FICX÷1

 Sandra: WHAT THE SUIT IS
 SPECIFICALLY ALLEGING IS THAT
 GERAGOS, REPR
 SMOLLETT IN ALL OF THIS AND HIS
 IN WIDELY REPORTED STATEMENTS
 THAT THE BROTHERS .yLED A

     [Woman] With my Shark,  I deep clean messes like this.
        This and even this.
  But I don't have to clean this,
     because the self-cleaning     brush roll removes hair,
          while I clean.
             [Announcer] Shark,
          the vacuum that deep       cleans, now cleans itself.
        300 miles an hour,
   that's where I feel normal.
  Having an annuity tells me my     retirement is protected.

 Bill: MARYLAND GOVERNOR HOGAN CONSIDERING A RUN FOR
 REPUBLICAN TOMORROW NATION AND
 TODAY HE IS THE FEATURED
 SPEAKER IN KW HAMPSHIRE, A
 MUST STOP ON THE TRAIL.
 KRISTIN FISHER IS LIVE IN
 MANCHESTER LISTENING TODAY.
 GOOD MORNING.
 NO ANNOUNCEMENT FROM
 GOVERNOR HOGAN TODAY.
 HE CAME TO NEW HAMPSHIRE READY
 TO PLAY ACCUSED PRESIDENT TRUMP
 OF TRYING TO COMMIT A CRIME,
 OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE, AND HE
 SLAMMED FELLOW REPUBLICANS ALL
 OVER THE COUNTRY FOR NOT
 JOINING HIM IN SPEAKING OUT.
 IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING.
 AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE A
 NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES BOTH
 GOVERNORS AND SENATORS AND
 MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE WHO WILL
 SAY PRIVATELY THEY'RE VERY
 CONCERNED BUT THEY WON'T SAY
 ANYTHING PUBLICLY BECAUSE
 THEY'RE AFRAID.
 THERE IS NO PROFILES IN COURAGE
 HERE.
 GOVERNOR HOGAN ANNOUNCED TO
 THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL
 COMMITTEE FOR INSISTING ON 100%
 LOYALTY TO THE DEAR LEADER.
 IN JANUARY THE RNC PASSED A
 RESOLUTION OF UNDIVIDED SUPPORT
 FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP MERGING THE
 PARTY AND HIS REELECTION TEAM
 INTO A SINGLE UNIT.
 LISTEN TO WHAT THE PARTY
 CHAIRWOMAN SAID OF THE
 POSSIBILITIES OF REPUBLICANS
 JUMPING IN.
 THEY HAVE TO RIGHT TO JUMP
 IN AND LOSE.
 THAT'S FINE.
 THE PRESIDENT HAS 93% APPROVAL
 IN OUR PARTY.
 BUT GOVERNOR HOGAN INSISTS
 THAT IF HE DECIDES TO RUN HE
 WOULD NOT BE A SPOILER AND IF
 HE DOES RUN, HE BELIEVES THAT
 HE MIGHT BE BETTER SUITED THAN
 MOST TO ABSORB ANY KIND OF
 ATTACKS FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP.
 HOGAN SAID TODAY I BATTLED
 CANCER FOR 18 MONTHS SO I THINK
