 THE WEEK GETS OFF TO A BUSY START, THANK YOU FOR JOINING
 US.
 WE BEGIN IN RICHMOND VIRGINIA
 WHERE PRESSURE IS MOUNTING ON
 GOVERNOR RALPH NORTHAM TO
 RESIGN, PICTURE ON HIS META-
 SCHOOL YEARBOOK PAGE SHOWS TWO
 MEN, ONE IN BLACKFACE AND THE
 OTHER IN A KU KLUX KLAN ROBE.
 WHEN THE PICTURE FIRST APPEARED
 ON FRIDAY, THE GOVERNOR
 APOLOGIZED FOR THE  DECISION HE
 MADE.
 ON SATURDAY, HE SAID IT WAS NOT
 HIM, BUT MEMBERS OF HIS OWN
 PARTY ARE CALLING ON HIM TO
 STEP DOWN.
 THERE IS ALWAYS A PLACE FOR
 SOMEBODY TO APOLOGIZE AND HAVE
 HUMILITY TO SAY, I WAS WRONG
 AND I REGRET SOMETHING, THERE
 IS ALWAYS A ROLE, WE BELIEVE IN
 REDEMPTION AND SOCIETY, BUT I
 BELIEVE WHAT IS HAPPENED IN
 THIS INSTANCE IS UNTENABLE.
 I DON'T KNOW HOW HE CAN GOVERN.
 WE'VE LEARNED THAT THE
 GOVERNOR HELD AN URGENT MEETING
 WITH THE STAFF MEMBERS, WE ARE
 LIVE FROM RICHMOND WITH THE
 LATEST.
 WE ARE STILL WAITING TO
 HEAR.
 IT FEELS LIKE WE ARE ON A
 RUDDERLESS SHIP IN RICHMOND
 WITH NO WORD YET FROM THE
 GOVERNOR'S MANSION.
 PEOPLE ARE ANGRY AND UPSET AND
 THERE HAVE BEEN PROTESTS ALL
 WEEKEND.
 ONE OF THEM IS STILL GOING ON
 RIGHT NOW NEXT TO THE
 GOVERNOR'S MANSION, TAKE A
 LISTEN.
 I BELIEVE THEN AND NOW THAT
 I AM NOT EITHER OF THE PEOPLE
 IN THAT PHOTO.
 THE GOVERNOR SAID ON
 SATURDAY THAT HE WOULD NOT
 RESIGN AFTER A RACIST PHOTO
 SURFACED FROM HIS 1984 MEDICAL
 SCHOOL YEARBOOK PAGE SHOWING A
 MAN IN BLACKFACE NEXT TO
 ANOTHER PERSON IN A KU KLUX
 KLAN  ROBE.
 AFTER APOLOGIZING ON FRIDAY
 AND SAYING THAT HE WAS IN THE
 PHOTO, HE BACKTRACKED ON
 SATURDAY AND SAID THAT HE WAS
 SURE THAT HE WAS NOT IN THE
 PHOTO.
 A PRESS CONFERENCE ON SATURDAY
 THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DAMAGE
 CONTROL DID THE OPPOSITE.
 NOT ONLY DID HIS STORY CHANGE,
 BUT HE ADMITTED THAT HE DID PUT
 ON BLACKFACE IN 1984 WHEN HE
 DRESSED UP TO LOOK LIKE MICHAEL
 JACKSON IN A DANCE CONTEST.
 AND WHEN ASKED IF HE WOULD
 DEMONSTRATE MOONWALKING, IT WAS
 HIS WIFE WHO STOPPED HIM FROM
 DOING IT.
 SHOCKED DEMOCRATS SAY HE LACKS
 THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE
 GRAVITY OF THE SITUATION.
 OVER THE WEEKEND CAME STATEWIDE
 AND NATIONAL CALLS FOR HIS
 RESIGNATION.
 THE FORMER GOVERNOR DOUG
 WILDER, THE VIRGINIA SENATORS
 MARK WARNER AND TIM KANE AND
 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES, HARRIS
 AND CORY BOOKER ALSO FORMER
 VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN ALL
 CALLING FOR GOVERNOR RALPH
 NORTHAM TO RESIGN.
 DEMOCRATS SAY HE HAS LOST THE
 MORAL AUTHORITY TO LEAD.
 MEANWHILE, ANOTHER POTENTIAL
 CONTROVERSY CONCERNING THE MAN
 WHO WOULD REPLACE NORTHAM,
 LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR JUSTIN
 FAIRFAX SENT OUT AN EARLY
 MORNING TWEET DENYING AN
 UNVERIFIED SEXUAL ASSAULT
 ALLEGATION FROM THE SAME
 CONSERVATIVE WEBSITE THAT BROKE
 THE STORY ABOUT HIS MEDICAL
 YEARBOOK PICTURE.
 THE STATEMENT ON TWITTER READ,
 LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR FAIRFAX HAS
 AN OUTSTANDING AND WELL-EARNED
 REPUTATION FOR TREATING PEOPLE
 WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT.
 HE HAS NEVER ASSAULTED ANYONE
 EVER IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM.

 THE PROTESTS ARE STILL CONTINUING AND I CAN HEAR THEM
 RIGHT NOW.
 TAKE A LISTEN TO SOME OF THAT
 GOING ON JUST NOW.
 RESIGN, RALPH, NOW SO YOU
 CAN HEAR IT, THERE ARE A FEW
 HUNDRED PEOPLE JUST TO THE SIDE
 OF THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION AND
 THEY'VE BEEN HERE ALL WEEKEND
 PROTESTING, SHOUTING, CALLING
 FOR RALPH NORTHAM'S
 RESIGNATION.
 THERE ARE PICTURES SAYING, ONE
 PICTURE SAYS YOU CANNOT GET
 BLACKFACE OFF AND YOU CAN'T GET
 RACISM OFF EITHER, A LOT OF
 ANGER HERE TODAY, JUST A SHORT
 TIME AGO, WE HEARD FROM THE
 HOUSE SPEAKER WHO SAID THEY ARE
 NOT MAKING PLANS TO IMPEACH
 GOVERNOR NORTHAM, THAT IS THE
 THRESHOLD THAT THEY WOULD
 DECIDE, THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE
 SOME SORT OF MEDICAL NECESSITY
 AND IT JUST ISN'T THERE.
 THEY AND MANY OTHERS ARE HOPING
 THAT THE GOVERNOR RESIGNS AND
 AS SOON AS WE HEAR ANYTHING, WE
 WILL LET YOU KNOW.
 THANK YOU SO MUCH, WE
 APPRECIATE THE UPDATE.
 JOINING US TO TALK ABOUT THE
 ISSUE AND THE IMPACT THAT IT
 WILL HAVE ON THE POTENTIAL,
 GOVERNMENT PARTY, WE HAVE THE
 PRESIDENT, MARCUS GOODWIN AND
 JENNIFER BLOOMER OF THE DC
 YOUNG DEMOCRATS.
 LET'S START WITH THE BIG
 QUESTION, WHAT IMPACT DO YOU
 THINK THIS WILL HAVE ON
 DEMOCRATS MOVING FORWARD?
 FIRST, I THINK WE ALREADY
 ESTABLISHED THAT DEMOCRATS WANT
 HIM TO RESIGN AND HE DOESN'T
 HAVE THE MORAL AUTHORITY AND
 THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY NEEDS
 ACCOUNTABILITY.
 IN ORDER FOR THE DEMOCRATIC
 BEFORE, HE HAS TO MAKE THE
 DECISION TO RESIGN IN ORDER FOR
 OTHER LEADERSHIP TO MOVE IN.
 YOU SEE ANY OTHER WAY TO
 MOVE PAST THIS?
 THE PROTEST OUTSIDE OF THE
 GOVERNOR'S MANSION ARE
 INDICATIVE OF THE SHAKEN
 CONFIDENCE THAT DEMOCRATS HAVE
 AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO MOVE
 FORWARD AS THEY SO ELOQUENTLY
 SAID, WITH LEADERSHIP THAT
 UNDERSTANDS THE PROBLEMS FACING
 US AND THAT HAVE THE SUPPORT OF
 THE PEOPLE BEHIND THEM.
 WHEN WE THINK ABOUT 2020,
 GEARING UP FOR THAT, WE ALSO
 KNOW THAT THERE IS AN ELECTION
 HAPPENING IN THE STATE
 LEGISLATURE IN VIRGINIA AS
 WELL.
 DO DEMOCRATS NEED TO BE
 CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT'S
 HAPPENING RIGHT NOW FOR FUTURE
 ELECTIONS?
 ABSOLUTELY.
 VIRGINIA IS ONE OF THE LARGEST
 STATES WHEN WE CONSIDER THE
 PRESIDENT OF PRIMARY AND
 UNDERSTANDING HOW WE SET
 OURSELVES UP FOR THE PAST IN
 WINNING THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE,
 WE NEED TO KNOW THAT WE HAVE
 LEADERSHIP IN PLACE THAT WILL
 REGAIN THE CONFIDENCE OF
 VIRGINIANS NOT JUST IN THE BIG
 CITIES, BUT ALSO IN THE MORE
 RURAL AREAS OF THE STATE AND
 GETTING LEADERSHIP LIKE
 LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR JUSTIN
 FAIRFAX IN PLACE IS THE FIRST
 STEP IN THE PROCESS TO HELP US
 HEAL THE WOUNDS AND REGAIN
 CONFIDENCE AND HAVE COMPETENT
 LEADERSHIP THAT WILL LEAD US
 FORWARD.
 THE LAST QUESTION FOR YOU,
 DOES THERE NEED TO BE A BIGGER
 CONVERSATION ABOUT BLACK FACE?
 WE'VE HAD TWO HIGH-PROFILE
 PEOPLE, MEGAN KELLY AND RALPH
 NORTHAM GET CAUGHT UP.
 IT IS VERY EVIDENT THAT A
 LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T REALLY
 UNDERSTAND THE ORIGINS LIKE
 WHAT IT MEANS TO LACK PEOPLE
 AND WHAT IT MEANT FOR ACTORS
 LIKE BERT WILLIAMS WHO WAS A
 BLACK MAN WHO PERFORMED IN
 BLACKFACE BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T
 ALLOW BLACK PEOPLE TO PLAY
 THEMSELVES.
 THERE IS A LONG HISTORY OF HURT
 AND DISCRIMINATION,
 MISUNDERSTANDING AND WILLFUL
 IGNORANCE AND HOPEFULLY WE WILL
 GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE HAVE A
 LARGER CONVERSATION.
 THANK BOTH OF YOU FOR
 JOINING US.
 WE APPRECIATE YOU GREATLY.
 WE WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT
 COVERAGE CONTINUES RIGHT NOW
 AND WE WILL HAVE MUCH MORE ON
 THE GOVERNOR'S ACTION COMING UP
 ON THE NEWS AT 5:00.
 WE WILL BE LOOKING INTO BIG-
 LEAGUE POLITICS, THAT IS THE
 SITE THAT PUBLISHED THE PHOTO.
 STEPHANIE RAMIREZ GOES INTO THE
 HISTORY AND WHY IT IS SO
 PAINFUL TODAY AND WE LOOK INTO
 LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR JUSTIN
 FAIRFAX.
 LET'S GET A CHECK ON THE
 FORECAST.
 WE WERE TALKING ABOUT SNOW
 SEVERAL DAYS WHERE WE WILL HAVE
 SOME SNOW SHOWER CHANCES AND A
 BIG ARCTIC BLAST.
 THIS WEEK IS A COMPLETE
 OPPOSITE.
 WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A FACE OF
 SPRING IN THE MIDDLE OF WINTER.
 WE HAVE SUNSHINE OUTSIDE RIGHT
 NOW AND WITH THAT, THE
 TEMPERATURE STARTING OFF IN THE
 20s AND LOW 30s THIS MORNING,
 THEY ARE CLIMBING UP INTO THE
 50s RAPIDLY AT LUNCHTIME.
 51 IN DC AND I WANT TO POINT
 OUT THAT WINDS ARE VERY LIGHT,
 AND THAT IS A PLAYER FOR HOW
 TODAY THE WEATHER WILL END UP
 TRANSLATING THIS AFTERNOON IN
 TERMS OF THE AIR QUALITY.
 WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT IN JUST A
 SECOND, 52 IN LEESBURG AND 56,
 ONE OF THE WARMEST SPOTS RIGHT
 NOW IN GAITHERSBURG AND YOUR 54
 IN WALDORF, SO THESE ARE
 ALREADY TEMPERATURES THAT ARE
 ABOVE AVERAGE FOR THE HIGHS
 THIS TIME OF YEAR.
 WE'VE GOT THOSE AT THE LUNCH
 HOUR TODAY.
 TEMPERATURES RUNNING 5 TO 10
 DEGREES WARMER THAN THEY WERE
 YESTERDAY.
 AND I MENTIONED THE LIGHT
 WINDS, THAT IS IMPORTANT TO
 WHAT THE AIR QUALITY IS TODAY.
 FOR TWO DAYS IN A ROW, WE'VE
 HAD FAIRLY LIGHT WIND, SO THAT
 TRACKS IN ALL OF THE AIR
 POLLUTION AND ALL OF THE
 PARTICULATE MATTER IN THE
 ATMOSPHERE.
 SO WE HAVE A CODE ORANGE AIR-
 QUALITY ALERT TODAY, UNHEALTHY
 FOR SENSITIVE GROUPS, ELDERLY
 AND PEOPLE WITH RESPIRATORY
 ILLNESS, AVOID EXCESSIVE TIME
 OUTDOORS, BUT FOR THE REST OF
 US, WARM TEMPERATURES AND
 SUNSHINE, YOU CAN'T COMPLAIN.
 WE CLIMB UP INTO THE 50s RIGHT
 NOW, 54 AT 3:00 AND THE HIGH
 TEMPERATURE TODAY WILL END UP
 IN THE MID TO UPPER 50s.
 THAT SOUNDS PRETTY NICE,
 DOESN'T IT?
 IF YOU ARE ENJOYING 50s TODAY,
 WE HAVE 60s ON THE WAY THIS
 WEEK AND WE WILL TALK ABOUT
 THAT AND MORE INFORMATION ON
 THAT THIS WEEK.
 A MEDICAL SCHOOL EMPLOYEE
 WAS SHOT JUST OUTSIDE THE
 UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND MEDICAL
 CENTER IN BALTIMORE.
 IT HAPPENED AROUND 7:15 THIS
 MORNING, OFFICIALS SAY THE
 VICTIM WAS SHOT IN THE FACE AND
 BUTTOCKS OUTSIDE THE AMBULANCE
 BAY.
 THE CONDITION RIGHT NOW IS
 UNKNOWN, POLICE TOOK A 26-YEAR-
 OLD MAN INTO CUSTODY AND HAVE
 RECOVERED A GUN.
 THEY BELIEVE TWO MEN, THEY
 BELIEVE THE TWO MEN KNEW EACH
 OTHER AND OFFICIALS ARE LOOKING
 INTO A POSSIBLE MOTIVE, THE
 HOSPITAL IS FUNCTIONING AS
 NORMAL.
 THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS ARE
 SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS YET AGAIN.
 THE PATRIOTS BEAT THE LA RAMS
 13-3 AND THAT WAS IN ATLANTA
 LAST NIGHT.
 IT WAS THE LOWEST SCORING SUPER
 BOWL GAME IN HISTORY.
 STILL, THE WIN GAVE THE NEW
 ENGLAND PATRIOTS THEIR SIXTH
 TROPHY.
 THEY WERE ALL LED BY TOM BRADY
 AND THE PATRIOTS TIED WITH THE
 STEELERS FOR THE MOST SUPER
 BOWL WINS BY A FRANCHISE.
 THE PATRIOTS WIDE RECEIVER
 JULIE SETTLEMENT, JULIAN
 EDELMAN EARNED THE MVP TROPHY.
 AFTER THE BIG WIN, ATLANTA
 RUPTURED WITH FANS GOING INTO
 THE STREETS AND EVEN TAKING
 PLACE IN BOSTON AS WELL.
 CROWDS WERE MOSTLY PEACEFUL,
 BUT POLICE SAID TWO PEOPLE WERE
 ARRESTED FOR MINOR OFFENSES AND
 PATRIOTS FANS CAN NOW LOOK
 FORWARD TO A CHAMPIONSHIP
 PARADE THAT WILL HAPPEN
 SOMETIME THIS WEEK.
 STILL TO COME, BUT LOOK AT
 THE WINNERS AND LOSERS AT LAST
 NIGHT SUPER
 WUSA9 NEWS IS SPONSORED IN PART BY GREENSPRING RETIREMENT
 COMMUNITY.
 WELCOME BACK, OFFICIALS ARE
 TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT
 CAUSED A SMALL PLANE TO CRASH
 INTO A RESIDENTIAL HOME IN
 CALIFORNIA YESTERDAY, KILLING
 FIVE PEOPLE.
 OFFICIALS SAY THE PILOT AND
 FOUR OCCUPANTS OF THE HOME, THE
 PLANE CRASHED INTO WERE KILLED.
 TWO OTHER PEOPLE WERE INJURED
 AS WELL.
 NEIGHBORS SAID THEY HEARD AN
 EXPLOSION AND RAN OUTSIDE TO A
 TERRIFYING SIGHT.
 I SAW THE HOUSE OVER HERE,
 DIAGONAL TO ME FULLY ENGULFED
 IN FLAMES AND I HEARD GLASS
 BREAKING AND PEOPLE YELLING FOR
 THEIR LIVES.
 SCREAMING, GOD HELP ME.
 IT FELT LIKE AN EARTHQUAKE,
 I GRABBED MY KIDS AND WENT INTO
 THE HALLWAY UNDER THE DOOR AND
 THERE WERE A COUPLE OF BOOMS
 AND EXPLOSIONS, AND THEN MY
 HUSBAND SAID NO, IT IS A PLANE.
 OFFICIALS SAY THE PLANE
 CRASHED SHORTLY AFTER TAKING
 OFF FROM A NEARBY AIRPORT.
 DEBRIS IS SCATTERED OVER FOR
 BLOCKS AND A NEARBY ELEMENTARY
 SCHOOL IS CLOSED AS AUTHORITIES
 CONTINUE THEIR INVESTIGATION.
 WE JUST LEARNED THAT THE
 YOUNGER THE RESTLESS STAR HAS
 PASSED AWAY.
 HE WAS FOUND DEAD INSIDE HIS
 LOS ANGELES HOME YESTERDAY.
 OFFICIALS SAY THERE DOESN'T
 SEEM TO BE ANY SIGNS OF FOUL
 PLAY.
 HE WAS 52 YEARS OLD.
 MELISSA NORTH JOINING US
 RIGHT NOW.
 I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I
 CELEBRATED MY BIRTHDAY
 YESTERDAY AND IT CONTINUES
 TODAY, AND WE HAVE BEEN HAVING
 AWESOME WEATHER.
 JUST FOR YOU.
 WE BROUGHT PUNXSUTAWNEY PHIL
 OVER THE WEEKEND BROUGHT YOU
 THE SPRING WEATHER.
 THAT IS IT.
 NOT FOR ANYBODY ELSE, JUST
 FOR YOU.
 IT IS REALLY NICE, A LOOK AT
 THE SUNSHINE OUTSIDE, WE HAVE A
 CODE ORANGE AIR-QUALITY ALERT
 AND THAT IS BECAUSE WE HAVE
 VERY LIGHT WINDS, THAT'S
 TRACKING IN ALL THE POLLUTION
 OUT THERE FOR THE PAST COUPLE
 DAYS AND YOU CAN KIND OF SEE
 THE HAZE AS YOU LOOK AT THE
 TOWER CAMERA, BUT LOOK AT THIS,
 THIS PUTS THINGS IN
 PERSPECTIVE.
 THIS AFTERNOON, DC CLIMBS UP
 INTO THE 50s UP TO 58 DEGREES,
 OUR AVERAGE FOR JANUARY 4 IS
 ONLY 45 DEGREES, SO TODAY, WE
 ARE ALREADY WITHIN 10 DEGREES
 ABOVE AVERAGE AND ABOVE AVERAGE
 TREND IS GOING TO LAST ALL WEEK
 LONG.
 LET ME LOOK AT THE WEATHER A
 LITTLE BIT MORE IN DETAIL HOUR
 BY HOUR, 51 RIGHT NOW AND BY
 3:00 THIS AFTERNOON, WE WILL BE
 UP IN THE MID TO UPPER 50s AND
 I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WILL BE
 STUCK IN THE 40s TODAY.
 WE ARE ALREADY CLIMBING WELL
 INTO THE 50s, SO IT WILL BE
 UNSEASONABLY WARM TODAY.
 5:00 JUST BEFORE SUNSET STILL
 IN THE LOW 50s IN KIDS AT THE
 BUS STOP, MAKE THEM PLAY
 OUTSIDE THIS WEEK, IT WILL
 REALLY BE THAT NICE FOR YOU.
 INTO THE OVERNIGHT, WE SEE
 TEMPERATURES FALLING BACK TO
 THE 40s AND SOME SPOTS INTO THE
 30s, BUT THERE WILL BE AN
 ISOLATED SHOWER CHANCE, IT'S A
 WARM WEEK AHEAD IN THE WEATHER
 HEADLINE, AND BY THE END OF THE
 WEEK, IT TURNS A LITTLE BIT
 MORE UNSETTLED, SO INSTEAD OF
 SEEING PURELY SUNNY DAYS, WE
 WILL BE CHECKING SOME SHOWERS
 EACH DAY, AND BY THIS WEEKEND,
 BACK DOWN TO REALITY BACK IN
 THE 40s FOR THE HIGH
 TEMPERATURES.
 IT ALL COMES DOWN TO THE
 PATTERN OF THE JET SPRING.
 PEOPLE MAY HEAR THE TERM
 JETSTREAM ALL THE TIME, BUT ALL
 THAT IS IS REALLY STRONG WENT
 ALL THE WAY UP WHERE THE PLANES
 FLY OUTSIDE, AND IT IS ALMOST
 THE DIVIDING LINE BETWEEN WARM
 AIR AND COLD AIR.
 THE JETSTREAM WILL DIP DOWN IN
 THE WEST AND GO UP NORTH OF US
 IN THE EAST.
 SO WHAT DOES THIS DO?
 IT CREATES COLD TEMPERATURES ON
 THE WEST COAST AND FOR THE EAST
 COAST, IT IS ALL ABOUT THE
 WARMTH.
 SO FOR DC OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL
 DAYS, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
 ABOVE AVERAGE TEMPERATURES, HOW
 MUCH ABOVE AVERAGE?
 50s AND 60s FOR US.
 WITH ONE DAY BEING THE
 EXCEPTION, LOOK AT THE NEXT
 FIVE DAYS, 58 DEGREES TODAY AND
 TOMORROW, WE ARE IN THE MID
 60s, THIS WILL BE A FEW DEGREES
 SHY OF SOME OF THE RECORD HIGHS
 FOR TOMORROW.
 WEDNESDAY IS A LITTLE COOLER
 WITH THE FRONT PASSING THROUGH
 BRINGING COOLER WEATHER FOR ONE
 DAY WITH MORE CLOUDS AND BY
 THURSDAY AND FRIDAY, WE WILL BE
 BACK IN THE 60s AGAIN.
 LAST WEEK, WE WERE TALKING
 ABOUT TEMPERATURES 20 DEGREES
 BELOW AVERAGE AND THIS WEEK, WE
 ARE TALK ABOUT TEMPERATURES 20
 DEGREES ABOVE AVERAGE.
 SO IT REALLY IS A FLIP IN THE
 PATTERN THAT IS ALL COMING DOWN
 TO THE JETSTREAM PATTERN.
 WE WILL TORN, WE WILL TURN A
 LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT, ISOLATED
 SHOWERS NORTH OF TOWN AND THE
 FRONT COMES THROUGH AND THAT'S
 SOUTH OF US SO THAT BRINGS MORE
 CLOUDS AND COOLER TEMPERATURES.
 TAKING FUTURECAST INTO THURSDAY
 AND FRIDAY, WE HAVE MORE
 SHOWERS, BUT IT IS NOT A WASHOUT
 THE ENTIRE TIME.
 THE FRONT MOVES THROUGH FRIDAY
 TAKING TEMPERATURES BACK DOWN
 INTO THE 40s FOR THE WEEKEND.
 ENJOY THE WARM TEMPERATURES.
 58 TODAY AND TOMORROW 65 AND WE
 HAVE COOL AND MORE CLOUDS AND
 40s FOR WEDNESDAY AND 60s ON
 THURSDAY AND FRIDAY AND BACK TO
 40 DEGREES WITH OVERNIGHT LOWS
 IN THE 20s FOR THE WEEKEND.
 THE BEST WEEK EVER.
 FOR SOME PEOPLE, SUPER BOWL
 SUNDAY IS REALLY ALL ABOUT THE
 GAME, BUT FOR OTHERS, IT'S ALL
 ABOUT THE COMMERCIALS AND THERE
 WERE SOME CLEAR WINNERS LIKE
 THE BUD LIGHT GAME OF THRONES
 CROSSOVER.
 THIS STARTED AS ONE OF THE DEER
 BRAND ADS BUT BECAME A PREVIEW
 FOR THE SEASON OF GAME OF
 THRONES.
 AND ANOTHER COMMERCIAL
 PEOPLE COULDN'T TALK ABOUT,
 STOP TALKING ABOUT, THE NFL
 GATHERING THE PAST SIX DECADES
 TICK OFF, TO KICK OFF THE
 CELEBRATION.
 WHAT HAPPENS IN THE ROOM?
 AN IMPROMPTU GAME OF AMERICA
 FAVORITE PASTIME.
 STOMACH AND MICROSOFT IS MOVING
 THE COMMERCIAL WAS ALL THAT
 INCLUSIVITY.
 IT FEATURED CHILDREN WITH
 DISABILITIES WHO TALK ABOUT HOW
 MICROSOFT'S NEW ADAPTIVE
 CONTROLLER HELPS THEM PLAY
 VIDEO GAMES AND EVEN PLAY WITH
 ONE ANOTHER.
 NO MATTER HOW YOUR BODY IS
 OR HOW FAST YOU ARE, YOU CAN
 PLAY.
 IT'S A REALLY GOOD THING TO
 HAVE IN THIS WORLD.
 MICROSOFT'S ADAPTIVE
 CONTROLLER IS ON SALE AND YOU
 CAN PICK ONE UP FOR JUST $100.
 OTHER WINNERS WERE THE AMAZON
 DON AWRY AND THE STELLA
 COMMERCIAL WITH JEFF BRIDGES
 AND CARRIE BRADSHAW.
 AND THEN THE BURGER KING AND
 ANDY WARHOL ADD DIDN'T SEEM TO
 GO WELL WITH PEOPLE AND WENT
 WAY OVER THEIR HEADS.

 WELCOME BACK, PAYPAL IS USED BY MILLIONS TO MAKE
 PURCHASES AND PAYMENTS ONLINE,
 BUT NOW SCAM ARTISTS ARE USING
 THE TRUSTED NAME TO RIP PEOPLE
 OFF.
 WHEN INDICA MOSLEY AND HER
 BROTHER NEEDED CASH, THEY
 DECIDED TO SELL SOME OF THEIR
 PRICEY SNEAKERS.
 WE PAY A LOT OF TUITION SO
 WE FIGURED WE WOULD GIVE OUR
 PARENTS A BREAK AND HELP OUT
 WITH GROCERIES AND GAS AND DO
 THINGS ON OUR OWN.
 THEY LISTED 23 SNEAKERS AND
 IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE, A BUYER
 WAS WILLING TO PAY $3000.
 THEIR REACTION WAS EXCITED AND
 EAGER.
 WHEN THE BUYER SUGGESTED THAT
 THEY AVOID THE $180 SERVICE FEE
 AND USE PAYPAL INSTEAD, THEY
 AGREED.
 THEY SAID THEY WOULD SEND
 THE MONEY OVER.
 YOU'VE GOT MONEY READ THE
 EMAIL.
 WE SHIPPED THE SHOES AND WE
 WAITED FOR THEM TO GET THERE
 AND WAITED FOR THE PAYMENT.
 AND WAITED AND WAITED SOME
 MORE.
 I CALLED THEM AND TEXTED
 THEM AND LEFT VOICEMAILS.
 REALITY SET IN AND THE
 PAYPAL EMAIL WAS FAKE.
 THEY HAD BEEN SCAMMED OUT OF
 PAYMENTS TOTALING NEARLY $3000
 FOR THE SNEAKERS.
 IT BLOWS MY MIND THAT
 EVERYTHING WAS FAKE.

 FONT AND THE KICKER WAS THE

 WE ARE LOOKING FOR THE
 PEOPLE THAT RECEIVED $3000
 WORTH OF SNEAKERS.
 AFTER A 10 MINUTE EXCHANGE,
 THEY NEVER GOT THE MONEY.
 DOES THAT SURPRISE YOU?
