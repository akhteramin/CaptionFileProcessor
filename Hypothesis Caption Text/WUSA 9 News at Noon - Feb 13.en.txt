 [ MUSIC ] GOOD AFTERNOON, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
 WE HAVE LOTS GOING ON TODAY,
 LET'S GET TO THE BIG THREE
 STORIES AT NOON.
 DON'T GET TOO COMFORTABLE,
 BECAUSE MORE SNOW IS ON THE WAY
 JUST IN TIME FOR THE WEEKEND.
 WE ARE TIMING OUT THE SNOW.
 THERE IS A NEW CRACKDOWN ON
 RIGHT TURNS ON RED IN THE CITY
 AND IF YOU GET CAUGHT, YOU WILL
 GET A HEFTY FINE.
 AND ACTOR JUSSIE SMOLLETT
 HANDS OVER HIS PHONE RECORDS TO
 HELP POLICE FIND THE MAN WHO HE
 SAYS  ATTACKED HIM.
 THE RECORDS WERE HEAVILY
 REDACTED, WHAT THIS MEANS FOR
 THE INVESTIGATION.
 TODAY'S SUNSHINE MAY BE A
 WELCOME SIGHT AFTER THE SNOW
 AND SLEET AND ICE, BUT IT WON'T
 BE AROUND FOR LONG.
 WE ARE TRACKING THREE POTENTIAL
 WINTER STORM SYSTEMS HEADING
 OUR WAY.
 LET'S CHECK IN WITH HOWARD
 BERNSTEIN.
 WHAT DO WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT
 THE APPROACHING STORMS?
 THERE IS A LOT OF
 UNCERTAINTY.
 THERE ARE THREE STORMS I'M
 TRACKING RIGHT NOW AS WE GO
 INTO THE WEEKEND.
 WE ARE LOOKING AT TEMPERATURES
 TODAY, NO PROBLEMS INTO THE
 40s, BUT LET'S LOOK AT SOME OF
 THE MODELS, BECAUSE THEY DO NOT
 AGREE.
 WHEN THEY DO NOT AGREE, THERE
 IS AN UNCERTAINTY FACTOR.
 THIS IS NOT A CLASSIC SET UP
 FOR SNOW, BUT THE CLASSIC SETUP
 IS A BIG HIGH ACROSS NEW
 ENGLAND AND A STORM PASSING TO
 THE SOUTHEAST.
 WE WILL START WITH THE GFS
 WHICH STARTS FRIDAY.
 WE MAY SEE AN ISOLATED
 SHOWERHEAD OF THE FRONT ON
 FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND ON
 SATURDAY, NOTICE THE BLUE OFF
 TO THE SOUTH AND WEST OF US AS
 WE GO THROUGH SATURDAY, THIS
 NOW, YESTERDAY HAD SNOW, BUT
 THIS NOW SLIDES SOUTH OF US AND
 THIS WOULD BE A MISS.
 THE SECOND SYSTEM ON SUNDAY IS
 QUICKLY BEHIND IT IN THE
 AFTERNOON AND EVENING.
 THIS COULD HAVE ICE, AND NOTICE
 THE SNOW TO THE NORTH IN
 PENNSYLVANIA AND THEN NUMBER
 THREE COMES IN TUESDAY NIGHT
 INTO WEDNESDAY.
 HERE COMES THE SNOW, AND THIS
 ONE HAS QUITE A BIT OF SNOW
 OVERNIGHT AND THAT LIFTS TO THE
 NORTH AND THIS IS JUST UPDATED
 FROM A LITTLE WHILE AGO.
 WE WANT TO SHOW YOU THE
 EUROPEAN SOLUTION TO ALL OF
 THIS, AS WE GO INTO SATURDAY
 MORNING, RAIN WITH SOME SNOW
 AND THE EUROPEAN, UNLIKE THE
 GFS, REALLY CLUBBERS US ON
 SATURDAY AND THEN THAT PULLS
 AWAY AND STORM 2 MAY BE A MESS,
 FREEZING RAIN FOR A WHILE AND
 STORM NUMBER THREE ON WEDNESDAY
 IS ALSO A LITTLE MIX, BUT
 MAINLY A RAIN SYSTEM.
 THE STORM AS POSSIBLE SATURDAY
 AND SUNDAY AND WEDNESDAY AND
 THEN SNOW VERSUS RAIN VERSUS
 ICE, SNOW IS LIKELY WITH THE
 THREE SYSTEMS, BUT AS I SAID
 EARLIER, LOTS OF UNCERTAINTY
 AND WE CONTINUE TO CHECK THIS
 CAREFULLY AND WE HAVE THE
 BREAKDOWN, THE RAKE OUT STORES
 ALONG WITH THE REGULAR FORECAST
 ON THE APP@TRAN09.COM.
 A SCARY SITUATION FOR
 RESIDENTS IN THE H STREET
 CORRIDOR LAST NIGHT, DOZENS OF
 OFFICERS WERE OUT WITH THEIR
 GUNS DRAWN AND IT WAS A TENSE
 SITUATION AND NOW FOR PEOPLE
 ARE UNDER ARREST.
 Reporter: THINGS ARE PRETTY
 MUCH BACK TO NORMAL HERE AT THE
 BUSY H STREET CORRIDOR AND THE
 INVESTIGATION IS FOCUSED ON
 THIS PIZZA SHOP RIGHT HERE
 RIGHT BY THE INTERSECTION OF
 FIFTH STREET AND EIGHTH STREET
 NORTHEAST.
 LET'S BREAK DOWN WHAT HAPPENED.
 POLICE GOT THE CALL JUST BEFORE
 11:00 LAST NIGHT THAT THERE WAS
 A MAN WITH A GUN.
 THEY SHOW UP AND FIND FOUR
 PEOPLE FLEEING THE SCENE IN A
 SILVER MINIVAN.
 SOMEONE WENT TOWARDS THE
 OFFICERS AND NO OFFICERS WERE
 HIT AND THEY ARE DOING JUST
 FINE.
 AND THEN THE MINIVAN GOES DOWN
 EIGHTH STREET A COUPLE BLOCKS
 AND MAKES A LEFT ON EIGHTH
 STREET ANOTHER BLOCK AND THEN
 THEY SCATTER.
 ALL FOUR OF THESE GUYS GO
 RUNNING.
 POLICE CHASE THEM ON FOOT AFTER
 A FEW MINUTES, THE CATCH ALL
 FOUR OF THEM, AND THEY FIND A
 GUN, THE BIG QUESTION IS, WHAT
 HAPPENED AT THIS PIZZA SHOP?
 THEY ARE LOOKING INTO WHETHER
 OR NOT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN A
 ROBBERY, CHAOTIC SCENE FOR A
 LOT OF THE SHOPPERS ON EIGHTH
 STREET NORTHEAST.
 WE ARE GLAD TO HEAR THE POLICE
 OFFICERS ARE DOING JUST FINE.
 OFFICERS FOUND A LARGE AMOUNT OF MARIJUANA IN THE CAR
 INCLUDING EDIBLES AND
 VAPORIZED.
 THEY ARE FACING GUN AND DRUG
 CHARGES.
 VIRGINIA STATE POLICE HAVE
 CLEARED AND ALEXANDER POLICE
 OFFICER INVOLVED IN A SHOOTING
 LAST DECEMBER.
 PEGGY FOX OBTAINED VIDEO NEAR
 THE 900 BLOCK OF NORTH PATRICK
 STREET.
 THE OFFICER FEARED FOR HIS LIFE
 WHEN THE 28-YEAR-OLD POINTED A
 GUN AT HIM.
 THAT MAN IS FACING FIVE
 CRIMINAL CHARGES INCLUDING
 ATTEMPTED WOUNDING OF AN
 OFFICER.
 AT LEAST ONE PERSON WAS INJURED
 IN A COMMUTER BUS CRASH IN
 CLINTON.
 THIS HAPPENED ON THE SOUTHBOUND
 SIDE OF RANCH AVENUE AT ABOUT
 8:00 THIS MORNING AND OFFICIALS
 ARE STILL NOT SURE WHAT CAUSED
 THE CRASH.
 THE BUS DRIVER WAS THE ONLY
 PERSON ON THE BUS WHEN
 SOMETHING CAUSED IT TO VEER
 INTO THE MEDIAN.
 THE DRIVER WAS TRAPPED AND HAD
 TO BE RESCUED AND WAS FLOWN TO
 THE NEAREST HOSPITAL.
 AN INVESTIGATION IS CURRENTLY
 UNDERWAY.
 CONGRESS HAS A DEAL IN
 PLACE TO AVOID YET ANOTHER
 GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN AND THE
 DEADLINE IS TWO DAYS AWAY AND
 THEY COULD PUT THE MEASURE UP
 FOR A VOTE TONIGHT.
 THE QUESTION, WILL PRESIDENT
 TRUMP SIGN IT?
 MATT GREGORY HAS THE STORY.
 THE PRESIDENT HAS HAD MIXED
 REACTIONS TO THE POTENTIAL DEAL
 AND EITHER WAY, CONGRESS SAYS
 THEY PLAN TO MOVE LOWER TODAY.
 IF YOU REMEMBER, THIS BATTLE
 WAS OVER FUNDING FOR A BORDER
 WALL.
 IN A DEAL REACHED BY BOTH
 PARTIES, CONGRESS OFFERED THE
 PRESIDENT ROUGHLY $1.4 BILLION
 FOR 55 MILES OF BORDER FENCING,
 BUT THAT IS WELL SHORT OF THE
 $5 BILLION HE ASKED FOR FOR 200
 MILES OF A BORDER WALL.
 AM I HAPPY AT FIRST GLANCE?
 I JUST GOT TO SEE IT, THE
 ANSWER IS NO.
 AUGUST PLANS TO GO AHEAD AND
 BOOK THE NIGHT ON THE FUNGUS
 AGREEMENT AND THE PRESIDENT
 INDICATED HE MAY ACTUALLY SIGN
 THE BILL.
 I DON'T THINK YOU ARE GOING
 TO SEE A SHUTDOWN.
 THE DEADLINE TO GET THE DEAL
 DONE WILL BE THIS FRIDAY.
 THE LAST PARTIAL GOVERNMENT
 SHUTDOWN LASTED 30 DAYS AND
 AFFECTED 800,000 FEDERAL
 WORKERS.
 WHEN I SPOKE WITH THE FEDERAL
 WORKER LAST NIGHT, SHE TOLD ME
 THAT SHE AND COLLEAGUES ARE ON
 "PINS AND NEEDLES WAITING TO
 SEE IF THIS DEAL GETS DONE AND
 THEY ARE OPTIMISTIC, BUT THEY
 DON'T WANT TO GET THEIR HOPES
 UP.
 IT LOOKS LIKE CONGRESS TONIGHT
 PLANS TO MOVE FORWARD WITH SOME
 SORT OF VOTE ON THE POTENTIAL
 DEAL.
 WHILE CONGRESS WORKS OUT
 THE NEW BUDGET DEAL, THE
 NATIONAL DEBT HAS TOPPLED $22
 TRILLION FOR THE FIRST TIME IN
 U.S. HISTORY.
 THE DEBT LIMIT BY MORE THAN $2
 TRILLION IN THE FIRST 2 YEARS
 SINCE PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK
 OFFICE AND IT CONTINUED TO
 ACCELERATE SINCE TAX CUTS WERE
 PASSED IN DECEMBER 2017.
 METRO IS LOOKING TO
 SUBSIDIZE UBER AND LYFT TRIPS
 FOR LATE-NIGHT WORKERS.
 THE TRANSIT AGENCY IS DRAFTING
 A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND
 THEY ARE TRYING TO HELP LATE-
 NIGHT WORKERS GET HOME AND GET
 TO WORK BETWEEN THE HOURS OF
 MIDNIGHT AND 4 AM.
 LATE-NIGHT SERVICE ON METRO HAS
 BEEN SUSPENDED TO HELP CREWS
 CATCH UP ON MAINTENANCE WORK.
 THE EXTENSION COULD BE EXTENDED
 FOR ANOTHER YEAR.
 THE PUBLIC SAFETY BOARD TAKES A
 PRELIMINARY VOTE ON THE MEASURE
 ON THURSDAY.
 THIS NEXT STORY IS FOR DRIVERS.
 A RIGHT TURN ON RED WILL
 SOON BE A THING OF THE PAST AT
 ABOUT 100 INTERSECTIONS IN THE
 CITY.
 THE NEW BAND BEGINS NEXT WEEK.
 WE HAVE A LOOK AT WHAT YOU CAN
 EXPECT.
 YOU WILL START SEEING A LOT
 MORE OF THESE SIGNS POPPING UP
 IN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS.
 THE GOAL IS TO CUT DOWN THE
 NUMBER OF PEOPLE DYING IN
 TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS.
 WE BELIEVE THAT TRAFFIC
 FATALITIES ARE DEPENDABLE.
 SPENT LAST YEAR, 3600 PEOPLE
 DIED, 36 PEOPLE DIED IN TRAFFIC
 INCIDENTS IN DC.
 THAT'S THE HIGHEST NUMBER IN 10
 YEARS.
 SO THAT IS THE REGION, THAT IS
 THE REASON WHY THEY SAY THIS
 HAS TO HAPPEN, BUT NOT EVERYONE
 AGREES.
 THIS GOES ON AND IT'S
 INHERENTLY WHY I DO THAT.
 IN OTHER PLACES THAT YOU HAVE A
 HIGH TRAFFIC VOLUME AND HIGH
 PEDESTRIAN VOLUME, IT MAY BE A
 CATASTROPHIC SITUATION.
 WHAT IS YOUR BIGGEST FEAR?
 THAT IT WILL CAUSE MORE
 INJURIES AND MORE FATALITIES
 AND IT WILL COST MORE REAR END
 COLLISIONS IN THE CITY.
 BUT YOU KNOW BE.SAYS THEY
 DID THE RESEARCH AND THEY THINK
 THAT THEY HAVE ENOUGH RESEARCH
 TO GO BY, THEY THINK THAT THEY
 ARE GOOD MOVING FORWARD WITH
 THIS.
 THEY ALWAYS SAY THAT, THAT'S
 WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SAY.
 BUT DDOT SAYS IT OPERATES ON
 FACTS AND LANDING RIGHT TURNS
 ON RED HAS WORKED IN OTHER
 CITIES.
 WE USE THE SCIENTIFIC
 APPROACH TO IDENTIFY LOCATIONS
 THAT HAVE A PARTICULARLY HIGH
 VOLUME OF STRANDS, AND THOSE
 ARE THE LOCATIONS FOR WHICH WE
 THINK THAT IMPROVING SAFETY IN
 THE INTERSECTION IS PARAMOUNT.
 THIS IS ALL A PART OF THE
 MAYOR'S VISION ZERO INITIATIVE.
 THE GOAL IS TO GET THE NUMBER
 OF TRAFFIC DEATHS DOWN TO ZERO
 IN JUST 5 YEARS.
 ON THE ROAD, I'M MICHAEL
 QUANDER.
 WHERE ARE ALL OF THESE
 INTERSECTIONS WITH THE RULES?
 WE HAVE YOU COVERED IN THAT
 REGARD, WE POSTED THE FULL LIST
 ON THE MOBILE APP AND WEBSITE,
 WUSA9.COM.
 STILL TO COME, LOCAL WOMAN
 SHARES HER STORY AFTER
 SUFFERING A HEART
 WUSA9 NEWS IS SPONSORED IN PART BY  GREENSPRING RETIREMENT
 COMMUNITY.
 AS WUSA9 CONTINUES THE
 IMPACT HEALTH MATTERS SERIES
 THIS MONTH, WE WANT YOU TO KNOW
 ABOUT HEART DISEASE AND THE
 EFFECT ON  WOMEN, IT IS THE
 NUMBER ONE KILLER OF WOMEN IN
 THE UNITED STATES.
 WE SAT DOWN WITH A FORMER NEWS
 REPORTER WHO SUFFERED A HEART
 ATTACK AT THE AGE OF 36.
 THIS IS MY BADGE OF HONOR.
 THIS GIVES ME POWER.
 THIS GIVES ME STRENGTH.
 THIS MEANS I'M NOT ALONE.
 JENNIFER DONNELLAN IS PROUD
 TO WEAR THIS RED DRESS IS A
 SYMBOL THAT IT'S TIME TO RAISE
 AWARENESS ABOUT HEART DISEASE
 IN THE DEADLY THREAT AGAINST
 WOMEN.
 A WOMAN NEEDS A CARDIOLOGIST
 IN HER LIFE LIKE SHE HAS A
 GYNECOLOGIST.
 BEFORE SHE TOOK HER POST AS
 DIRECTOR OF MEDIA RELATIONS FOR
 THE PRINCE GEORGES COUNTY
 POLICE DEPARTMENT, SHE SPENT 20
 YEARS AS A TELEVISION NEWS
 REPORTER INCLUDING 10 SPENT
 RIGHT HERE REPORTING ON CRIME
 THROUGHOUT THE DMZ.
 IT WAS DIFFICULT, REALLY AT
 THE TIME, I HAD BLINDERS ON, IT
 WAS ALL ABOUT THE CAREER.
 EVERY THING ELSE SORT OF FELL
 TO THE WAYSIDE.
 YOU WENT TO SLEEP WHEN HE WENT
 TO SLEEP AND YOU WOKE UP WHEN
 HE WOKE UP AND YOU ATE WHAT YOU
 COULD.
 SHE WAS ALWAYS ON THE GO
 UNTIL ONE DAY AFTER A LIFE SHOT
 AND CHEST PAIN STOPPED HER.
 I BEGAN TO FEEL SOMETHING IN
 THE MIDDLE OF MY CHEST.
 WHEN I SAY IN THE MIDDLE OF MY
 CHEST, IT FELT LIKE IT WAS FIVE
 MILES AWAY, IT WAS SO DEEP
 INSIDE, I TOOK A FEW STEPS IN
 THE PAIN GOT WORSE.
 A FEW MORE STEPS AND THEN MY
 LEFT ARM, I WAS ON ALL FOURS AT
 THAT POINT.
 SHE WAS RUSHED TO THE
 HOSPITAL AND DOCTORS TOLD HER
 SHE WAS HAVING A HEART ATTACK,
 SOMETHING SHE NEVER IMAGINED
 HAPPENING AT THE AGE OF 36.
 SHE WAS ALWAYS WORRIED ABOUT
 BREAST CANCER WHICH KILLED HER
 GRANDMOTHER.
 THAT MOMENT WAS SO
 TERRIFYING, NOW I AM IN SHOCK,
 AND I'M IN FEAR FOR MY LIFE,
 WILL I SURVIVE THIS?
 SHE HAD SOMETHING CALLED A
 SPONTANEOUS CORONARY ARTERY
 DISSECTION.
 THE INNER LINING OF MY RIGHT
 CORONARY ARTERY TORE LIKE A
 PIECE OF FABRIC AND IT BLOCKED
 THE ARTERY AND ALL OF THE BLOOD
 THAT WAS GOING INSIDE CLOTTED.
 DOCTORS USED STENTS TO OPEN
 ARTERY.
 I REMEMBER SAYING IT HURTS, IT
 HURTS.
 AND THAT WAS IT.
 THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A FEELING
 LIKE THIS IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.
 A HEART ATTACK AT THE AGE OF
 36 THAT SHE NEVER SAW COMING.
 THE STRESS THAT THEY, LIKE
 STRESS KILLS, THAT'S REAL.
 PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT.
 JUST GRATEFUL TO BE ALIVE
 TODAY.
 REPORTING IN PRINCE GEORGE'S
 COUNTY, WUSA9.
 A POWERFUL STORY NO DOUBT,
 ACCORDING TO THE CDC, HEART
 DISEASE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
 DEATHS OF ONE OUT OF FOUR
 WOMEN.
 AND THAT IS WHY OUR NEXT IMPACT
 HEALTH MATTERS EXPO IS SO
 IMPORTANT.
 WE WILL OFFER FREE HEALTH
 SCREENINGS AT THE KILLING
 COMMUNITY CENTER IN PRINCE
 GEORGES COUNTY ON THURSDAY,
 FEBRUARY 21.
 THERE WILL BE TWO SESSIONS, ONE
 IN THE EARLY MORNING FROM SIX
 UNTIL 11 AND ANOTHER IN THE
 AFTERNOON FROM TWO UNTIL 7:00.
 TO LEARN MORE AND SIGN UP, YOU
 CAN GO TO OUR WEBSITE,
 WUSA9.COM/HEALTH MATTERS , AND
 WE KNOW SO MANY COLLEAGUES HERE
 AT THE STATION AND HAD THEIR
 OWN EXPERIENCES WITH THIS.
 THIS IS REAL.
 FRIENDS AND FAMILY MEMBERS,
 GET YOUR NUMBERS CHECK.
 I'VE BEEN CHECKING SINCE 15 OR
 17 YEARS AGO, GENETICS IS A
 GIFT THAT KEEPS GIVING GOOD OR
 BAD.
 GET A CHECK AND I SALUTE ALL
 THE FOLKS AT AMERICAN HEART
 ASSOCIATION TO ERADICATE HEART
 DISEASE.
 PREVENTION GOES A LONG WAY.
 WE HAVE A CHANCE FOR WINTRY
 WEATHER AS WE GO TO THE
 WEEKEND, IF YOU MISSED THE TOP
 OF THE BROADCAST, I WILL GO
 OVER THIS ONE MORE TIME, THE
 GFS, THE AMERICAN MODEL HAS A
 SLIGHT CHANCE FOR SHOWERS
 FRIDAY.
 WE WILL BE WELL IN THE 50s, BUT
 LOOK OUT QUICKLY, BY SATURDAY
 MORNING, SNOW DEVELOPING AND
 NOW TO THE SOUTH, YESTERDAY IT
 WAS ON TOP OF US AND THIS WILL
 BE A MISSED SATURDAY AND THIS
 WILL CHANGE OVER THE DAYS,
 STORM NUMBER TWO ON SUNDAY
 COULD HAVE SNOW AND THEN IT IS
 WAY UP ABOVE I-80 AND SOME
 POINTS AND STORM 3 WILL CHECK
 FOR TUESDAY NIGHT AND
 WEDNESDAY, YOU WILL NOTICE THE
 SNOW TO OUR SOUTHWEST OUT
 TOWARD HARRISONBURG AND
 CHARLOTTESVILLE SOUTH, AND THEN
 AS WE GET INTO WEDNESDAY
 MORNING, JUST SOME MODERATE
 SNOW AND CHANGING TO SLEET AND
 FREEZING RAIN AND THEN LIFTING
 TERRAIN HERE BY WEDNESDAY
 EVENING AND SNOW NORTH, THIS
 COULD BE THE BIGGER ONE
 ACCORDING TO THE GFS.
 THE EUROPEAN MODEL BRINGS US
 INTO SATURDAY MORNING AND THAT
 IS FRIDAY, BUT SOME SNOW NORTH
 AND WEST SWITCHING OVER TO MUCH
 MORE SNOW BY MID-DAY AND BY
 SATURDAY EVENING, THAT STORM IS
 GONE, SO THE EURO HAS SNOW
 SATURDAY AND THE GFS IS A MESS
 AND STORM 2, WE HAVE A LITTLE
 BIT OF A WINTRY MIX AND
 FREEZING RAIN OVER TERRAIN AND
 GONE AND AND STORM 3 WEDNESDAY
 IS MORE OF A RAINMAKER IN THE
 EURO, BUT A SNOW MAKER ON THE
 GFS.
 SNOW POSSIBLE SATURDAY AND
 SUNDAY AND WEDNESDAY AND WE
 DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S SNOW OR
 RAIN OR ICE.
 IT'S JUST TOO SOON, THESE
 DETAILS WORK THEMSELVES OUT
 OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND SOME
 SNOW IS LIKELY DESPITE OF THE
 UNCERTAINTY, AND WE LOOK AT THE
 TWO MODELS OVER THE NEXT SEVEN
 DAYS, THIS GOES OUT 168 HOURS,
 WE LOOK AT THE EUROPEAN, THE
 BAND OF SNOW WITH HEAVIEST
 STUFF WEST, THAT'S 3+ INCHES
 FOR DC AND THE GFS IS IN THE
 WHITE, 1 TO 3 WITH HEAVIEST
 SNOW SOUTH AND WEST OF US, BUT
 FARTHER SOUTH THAN THE HERO,
 THE GFS GOING DOWN INTO NORTH
 CAROLINA, WE HAVE TO WATCH AND
 WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
 THERE IS SOME SNOW FALLING
 WEALTH OF THE NORTH AND EVEN
 NOT THAT FAR AWAY ONCE YOU GET
 NORTH OF I-70, SNOW SHOWERS
 HERE IN PARTS OF WEST VIRGINIA
 ACROSS 522 TO HAGERSTOWN AND
 OVER TO WESTMINSTER.
 AND TALK HIS BILL IN NORTHERN
 BALTIMORE COUNTY AND THURMONT
 AND EMMITSBURG SEEING A COUPLE
 FLAKES, NO BIG DEAL, BUT THERE
 ARE SNOW SHOWERS OUT THERE WITH
 TEMPERATURES THIS HOUR IN THE
 UPPER 30s NORTH AND UPPER 40s
 WANTING TO 50 THIS AFTERNOON
 AND WE SEE SOME SUNSHINE AND
 CLOUDS MIX AND CLEAR SKIES
 TONIGHT AND THE BREEZE WILL BE
 DIMINISHING.
 RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE PARTLY
 CLOUDY 48 AND DEW POINTS IN THE
 20s AND THE PRESSURE IS RISING
 QUICKLY.
 THAT'S AFTER BEING PRETTY LOW
 THE LAST COUPLE STORMS.
 PARTLY TO MOSTLY SUNNY THIS
 AFTERNOON AND 44 TO 52 AND WINS
 WEST 10 TO 20 AND TONIGHT IS
 MOSTLY CLEAR WITH 26 TO 32 AND
 THERE MAY BE SOME SLICK SPOTS
 WHERE MELTING IS OCCURRING.
 BREEZY AT TIMES ON THURSDAY AND
 FRIDAY NEAR 60 WITH THE
 ISOLATED SHOWER AND COLD
 WEATHER RETURNS WITH THE THREAT
 FOR WINTRY WEATHER SATURDAY AND
 SUNDAY, BUT NEXT WEEK, WE START
 CHILLY, BUT WE ARE OKAY UNTIL
 TUESDAY NIGHT.
 DC'S FAVORITE BALD EAGLE,
 LIBERTY AND JUSTICE HAVE JUST
 LAID THERE FIRST EGG OF THE
 YEAR, THEY HAVE BEEN TOGETHER
 FOR 14 YEARS, AND THEIR NESTS
 SITS HIGH IN THE OAK TREE IN
 SOUTHWEST DC.
 WE ARE TOLD IT TAKES ANYWHERE
 BETWEEN 35
 ESQUIRE MAGAZINE IN HOT WATER THIS AFTERNOON AND YOU
 CAN SEE THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE
 FOR RUINING YOUR MARRIAGE.
 WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THOSE
 STORIES AND MORE, LET'S KICK
 THINGS OFF WITH ESQUIRE GETTING
 A LOT OF ATTENTION ONLINE
 PRIMARILY FOR THE MARCH ISSUE.
 LOTS OF PEOPLE SAY IT SEEMS TO
 MISS THE MARK.
 THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE
 AMERICAN BOY, MIDDLE-CLASS
 AMERICAN, SO I THINK THE ISSUE
 HERE IS PEOPLE JUST SAY, WHY
 ARE WE REPRESENTING ANOTHER
 WHITE PERSON DURING BLACK
 HISTORY MONTH?
 ABIGAIL SAYS I DON'T MIND
 THAT THERE IS AN ARTICLE ABOUT
 A WILL YOUNG WHITE BOY WITH
 PRIVILEGE, BUT I DO MIND IF IT
 COMES OUT IN BLACK HISTORY
 MONTH.
 THAT WAS THE PRINCIPAL
 ISSUE, WE HEARD FROM ESQUIRE
 AND THEY SAY WE PLANNED ON
 PROFILING A LOT OF DIFFERENT
 PEOPLE, BUT THIS IS THE ONE
 THAT THEY WANTED TO PROFILE
 RIGHT NOW.
 THERE IS ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE ON
 THIS THAT IS A CULTURAL DYNAMIC
 IN THE COUNTRY CHANGING AND IT
 WARRANTS SOME PERSPECTIVE AND
 AT LEAST SOME INVESTIGATION TO
 SEE WHAT IS IT LIKE TRYING TO
 NAVIGATE THIS SPACE THAT WE ARE
 IN NOW AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
 JUSSIE SMOLLETT WHOSE STORY
 CONTINUES TO EVOLVE AND HE HAS
 TURNED OVER PHONE RECORDS TO
 POLICE AS THEY TRIED TO FIND
 THE PEOPLE THAT ALLEGEDLY
 ASSAULTED HIM.
 THOSE PHONE RECORDS HAVE BEEN
 HEAVILY REDACTED AND THEY'VE
 BEEN REJECTED BY THE CHICAGO
 POLICE DEPARTMENT.
 I THINK THAT IS WHERE IT IS
 CHANGING FOR PEOPLE.
 WHEN THIS BROKE, PEOPLE WERE
 WORRIED THAT SOMETHING LIKE
 THIS COULD HAPPEN TO HIM, BUT
 NOW TURNING IN THIS
 INFORMATION, IT SEEMS LIKE YOU
 ARE WITHHOLDING SOMETHING.
 IF THE HATE CRIME HAPPENED,
 THEY WOULD DO ANYTHING AND
 EVERYTHING TO GET JUSTICE.
 A LOT OF EYEBROWS BEING
 RAISED, BECAUSE IT CERTAINLY IS
 LEADING TO SOME CONSPIRACY
 THEORIES THAT SOMETHING MIGHT
 BE LARGER GOING ON, BUT WE DO
 NOT KNOW AND WE CERTAINLY DON'T
 HAVE INFORMATION, BUT WE DO
 KNOW THAT HE HAS BEEN
 COOPERATIVE WITH POLICE, BUT IN
 THE END, WE WILL FIND OUT WHAT
 EXACTLY HAPPENED IN THE
 SITUATION.
 WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ANOTHER
 STORY TRENDING RIGHT NOW ON OUR
 WEBSITE, IT IS ABOUT A SERIES
 OF STATES THAT HAVE LAWS IN
 PLACE THAT ALLOW THOSE THAT
 HAVE BROKEN UP IN THEIR
 RELATIONSHIPS TO ACTUALLY GO
 SUE A MISTRESS OR HOMEWRECKER
 OR SIDE PIECE OR WHATEVER THAT
 THEY FEEL ORCHID DEMONSTRATE
 HAS BEEN INVOLVED AND
 RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR
 RELATIONSHIP WHEN THE MARRIAGE
 DISSOLVED.
 MARYLAND AND VIRGINIA ARE
 NOT INCLUDED, BUT ALL YOU NEED
 IS PROOF, IF YOU FEEL THAT THIS
 PERSON INTERRUPTED YOUR
 MARRIAGE IN ANY WAY, ALL YOU
 NEED IS PROOF, AND THIS WEEK,
 THIS IS THE TEASE, THIS IS WHY
 I GOT A GOOD DIVORCE SETTLEMENT
 SAYS KELLY, BECAUSE MY EX, THEY
 OWNED PROPERTY IN NORTH
 CAROLINA, SO HE DIDN'T KNOW HOW
 LONG THEY HAD THE PRIVATE
 INVESTIGATOR.
 TO LOOK AT THAT.
 BE CAREFUL OUT THERE.

 LOOKING PRETTY GOOD THIS AFTERNOON, LITTLE BREEZY,
 LOVELY TOMORROW AND 54 AND
 ISOLATED SHOWERS NEAR 60 AND WE
 HAVE A CHANCE FOR RAIN OR SNOW
 OR A MIXED SATURDAY AND SUNDAY
 AND THEN AGAIN ON TUESDAY NIGHT
 AND WEDNESDAY, WE WILL KNOW
 BETTER AS WE GET CLOSER TO IT,
 MODELS ARE NOT IN AGREEMENT, SO
 THERE IS A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY
 GOING INTO THE WEEKEND.
 SATURDAY MAY BE MISSING US TO
 THE SOUTH, SO IT COULD BE DRY,
 BUT THEN WE STILL HAVE SUNDAY
 AND NEXT TUESDAY NIGHT AND
 WEDNESDAY TO WORRY ABOUT.
 AND WE HAVE VALENTINES
 TOMORROW.
 LOVELY, HAVE A GREAT DAY
 EVERYBODY, WILL SEE YOU LATER
 TONIGHT ON THE NEWS AT 5:00
    When I kept finding myself       smoking in my attic.
               Dad!
        Hiding when I was     supposed to be quitting.
      I thought, I should try       something that works.
      I should try Nicorette.
     <i> Nicorette Mini relieves</i>      <i> sudden cravings fast.</i>
       <i> Anytime. Anywhere.</i>
         <i> Nicorette Mini.</i>
   <i> You know why. We know how.</i>
         <i> Nicorette Mini.</i>
  When I received the diagnosis,
    I knew, whatever it takes,
   wherever I have to go... I'm          beating this.
    Breast cancer treatment is      continuing to evolve.
  CTCA is definitely on the cusp        of those changes.
  We really focus on taking the              time
  with each individual patient
 so they can choose the treatment      appropriate for them.
  I empower women with choices.
     It's not just picking a            surgeon.
 It's picking the care team, and  feeling secure where you are.
