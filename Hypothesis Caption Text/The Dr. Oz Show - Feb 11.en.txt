 SEASON 10? YEAH!
 I LOVE YOU, DR. OZ.
 [APPLAUSE]


 DR. OZ: TODAY, WE ARE INVESTIGATING ALL DAY FAST FOOD
 BREAKFASTS BECAUSE YOUR FAVORITE
 CHOICE IS NOW AVAILABLE ANYTIME
 AND MAY BE THE START OF THE NEW
 BREAKFAST WARS AMONGST THE FAST
 FOOD BRANDS WITH ONE EVEN
 QUESTIONING IF IT'S COMPETITORS
 ARE SERVING REAL EGGS AT ALL.
 BACK IN THE DAY, IF YOU TRIED TO
 ORDER BREAKFAST AT 10:31 A.M.,
 YOU WERE OUT OF LUCK.
 BUT TODAY, MORE CHAINS ARE
 OFFERING EGG SANDWICHES,
 HASHBROWNS, AND COFFEE ALL DAY
 LONG.
 WE ARE IN A FAST FOOD BREAKFAST
 BOOM.
 IT IS JUST A CHOICE.
 YOU CAN HAVE IT WHENEVER YOU
 WANT.
 EVEN THOUGH IT IS 5:30 P.M.,
 I STILL WANT AND AND FAMILY --AN
 EGG SANDWICH.
 DR. OZ: IT IS NOT JUST BURGER
 JOINTS.
 TACO AND COFFEE CHAINS ARE ALSO
 WAKING UP TO THE IDEA OF CASHING
 IN ON BREAKFAST SANDWICHES AND
 WRAPS.
 BUT RECENT HEADLINES ARE RAISING
 QUESTIONS.
 OUR THE EGGS IN YOUR FAST FOOD
 SANDWICH REAL?
 PANERA, WHICH ONLY USES 100%
 REAL EGGS, IS PETITIONING THE
 FDA TO ESTABLISH A CLEAR
 DEFINITION OF THE TERM "EGG."
 A QUICK LOOK AT OTHER CHAIN
 RESTAURANT WEBSITES, AND YOU
 WILL SEE A LOT OF VERY
 PROCESSED-SOUNDING INGREDIENTS
 IN EGG SANDWICHES.
 MODIFIED FOOD STARCH, SODIUM
 PHOSPHATE, POWDERED CELLULOSE,
 AND XANTHAN GUM.
 WHAT IS GUM DOING IN YOUR
 EGGS?
 TODAY, WE ARE SERVING UP THE
 TRUTH ABOUT YOUR ALL-DAY
 BREAKFAST FOODS.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: INVESTIGATOR IS HERE TO
 HELP US INVESTIGATE.
 WHY IS IT FAST FOOD MEALS HAVE
 BECOME SO POPULAR?
 AMERICANS WANT WHAT THEY
 WANT, AND THIS FOOD IS PRETTY
 GOOD.
 THE PERFECT TRIFECTA OF SALT,
 SUGAR FAT.
 THERE ARE SO MANY MORE OPTIONS
 NOW.
 BEFORE, THERE WERE ONLY A
 HANDFUL OF PLACES THAT OFFERED
 BREAKFAST.
 NOW THERE ARE SOME THE THINGS
 YOU CAN GET.
 THERE IS ONE THING.
 YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IS IN YOUR
 BREAKFAST WHEN YOU GRAB AND GO.
 DR. OZ: LET'S START WITH THE
 MOST POPULAR ITEM ON THE MENU,
 THE BREAKFAST SANDWICH.
 LET'S START WITH THE EGGS.
 ONE OF THE BIG BRANDS WENT TO
 THE FDA INSISTING THEY DEFINE
 WHAT AN EGG IS.
 WHAT GIVES?
 THIS IS ALL THAT BRAND
 INTEGRITY.
 THEY SAY WE USE 100% REAL EGGS
 AND LOOK TO THE FDA FOR
 GUIDELINES.
 THERE IS NO CLEAR GUIDELINE ON
 WHAT AN EGG IS.
 SOME OF THEIR COMPETITORS ARE
 USING EGGS WITH ADDITIVES.
 THEY ARE SAYING WE NEED YOU TO
 SET THE STANDARD.
 DR. OZ: EGGS ARE READY-MADE.
 YOU BREAK THE SHOW AND YOU HAVE
 THE EGG.
 THAT SOUNDS GOOD.
 THIS IS REALLY ABOUT SHELFLIFE.
 WHEN YOU GO TO A FAST FOOD
 RESTAURANT, YOU WANT YOUR FOOD
 BEFORE YOU FINISH PAYING.
 TO DO THAT, THEY ADD TONS OF
 ADDITIVES TO MAKE SURE IT CAN
 LAST LONGER.
 THEY COOK IT UP AND REHEAT IT
 WHEN IT IS READY TO GO.
 DR. OZ: THE FAST FOOD BREAKFAST
 MAY NOT BE AS FRESH AS YOU
 THINK.
 WHEN FAST FOOD MOVED TO THE ALL
 DAY PLAN, IT MAKES US WONDER, IS
 IT ALWAYS FRESH MADE, READY TO
 ORDER, OR IS IT SITTING AROUND
 FOR A WHILE?
 THE TRUTH IS YOU DON'T KNOW
 WHAT YOU'RE GETTING.
 DR. OZ: WE FOUND UP BREAKFAST
 SANDWICHES ARE SOMETIMES MADE
 FROM LIQUID EGGS.
 I GET THAT THE INSIDE OF AN EGG
 IS LIQUIDY, BUT WHAT IS THIS?
 STARTING IN 2009, PEOPLE
 CONSUME 76 BILLION EGGS.
 30% OF THIS WAS EGG PRODUCTS.
 IT CAN BE LIQUID EGGS, FROZEN,
 OR DRIED.
 EGG PRODUCT IS ACTUALLY AN EGG
 THAT IS CRACKED AND MIXED WITH
 SOMETHING ELSE.
 THEY DO THIS FOR SHELFLIFE.
 IT ALLOWS IT TO LAST LONGER.
 DR. OZ: IF I GO TO A FAST FOOD
 RESTAURANT AND BY AN EGG, HOW DO
 I KNOW IF IT IS IN A PRODUCT OR
 IF THEY BROKEN EGG?
 IF IT IS FOLDED LIKE THIS,
 THAT MEANS IT HAS STARCH AND
 LIKELY OTHER ADDITIVES IN IT.
 DR. OZ: LOOK HOW IT IS FOLDED?
 IT IS CUTE, BUT HAS OTHER
 STUFF IN IT.
 DR. OZ: LIKE A PIECE OF PAPER.
 A DELICIOUS PIECE OF PAPER.
 DR. OZ: YOU HAVE A HACK TO
 GUARANTEE WE CAN GET A FRESH
 EGG.
 WHAT DO YOU ORDER?
 YOU HAVE TO ASKED TO SUB
 OUT FOR A ROUND EGG.
 THEY WILL TAKE A FRESH EGG,
 CRACK IT OPEN, PUT IT IN A
 CIRCULAR RING, AND COOK IT RIGHT
 THERE FOR YOU.
 DR. OZ: IT SEEMS EFFICIENT.
 YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE
 INVESTING IN GETTING THE
 HEALTHIEST THING YOU CAN FOR
 YOUR BODY.
 DR. OZ: SUBBED ROUND EGG.
 THAT IS HOW YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
 GETTING.
 NEXT, WE INVESTIGATED THE MEAT
 OF THE BREAKFAST SANDWICH.
 WE INVITED THIS BUTCHER.
 HE KNOWS GOOD MEAT.
 ALL BREAKFAST SANDWICHES CAN BE
 ORDERED WITH OR WITHOUT MEAT.
 NOTHING SAYS NEW YORK
 BREAKFAST LIKE A BACON, EGG, AND
 CHEESE IN MY OPINION.
 TO BRING ALL THOSE FLAVORS FROM
 THE RUNNY EGG AND CHEESE, YOU
 HAVE TO ADD MEAT.
 TYPICALLY BACON OR SAUSAGE.
 DR. OZ: WE HAVE BACON, SAUSAGE
 PATTIES.
 CANADIAN BACON AS WELL.
 YOU HAVE TASTED THEM ALL.
 YOU HAVE THE DISCRIMINATING
 PALATE OF A BUTCHER.
 HOW WE UNDERSTAND HOW YOU CREATE
 THESE.
 WHERE STARTING WITH THE
 SAUSAGE PATTY.
 FROM A BUTCHER'S PERSPECTIVE,
 THIS IS A COMBINATION OF GROUND
 PORK.
 DR. OZ: HOW ABOUT BACON?
 BACON I AM A FAN OF.
 IT TENDS TO BE ELASTIC AND NOT
 VERY HAPPY.
 KIND OF SAD.
 IF THIS WAS COMING OUT OF MY
 SHOP, I WOULD HAVE A THICKER CUT
 AND NICER QUALITY.
 DR. OZ: IT WOULD NOT BEND.
 IT WOULD NOT BEND AND IT
 WOULD SMELL NICER.
 DR. OZ: BUTCHER SNOB.
 HOW ABOUT CANADIAN BACON?
 CANADIAN BACON IS THE LEANEST
 CUTS.
 IT ALSO HAS A RUBBERY
 CONSISTENCY.
 TYPICALLY PORK LOIN IS WHERE
 THIS IS COMING FROM.
 DR. OZ: SAUSAGE, WE DON'T KNOW
 WHERE THAT CAME FROM ON THE PIG.
 BACON COMES FROM THE PORK BELLY.
 THE LOIN IS THIS AREA HERE,
 WHERE THE CANADIAN BACON COMES
 FROM.
 HAM IS FROM HERE AND HERE.
 SAUSAGE CAN BE A COMBINATION
 OF ALL OF THESE CUTS.
 DR. OZ: IT COULD BE ANYTHING.
 CORRECT.
 NOT FROM ME.
 DISCLAIMER.
 DR. OZ: THANK YOU FOR YOUR
 EXPERTISE.
 THE NEXT THING WE LOOKED AT WAS
 WHETHER ORDERING A BREAKFAST
 SANDWICHES A HEALTHY CHOICE TO
 MAKE LATER IN THE DAY OR NIGHT.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: YOU ARE A MEMBER OF THE
 AUDIENCE.
 WE PICKED YOU RANDOMLY.
 YOU HAVE DECIDED TO GO WITH THE
 EGG SANDWICH.
 YOU BELIEVE IT IS HEALTHIER THAN
 THE HAMBURGER.
 THE BIG BATTLE RIGHT NOW IS
 BETWEEN HAMBURGERS AND EGG
 SANDWICHES.
 WHY DO YOU BELIEVE THE EGG
 SANDWICHES ARE BETTER?
 I THINK IT IS BETTER BECAUSE
 IT DOES NOT LEAVE ME SLUGGISH.
 IT IS ALSO A HEALTHIER OPTION
 THAN THE BURGER.
 DR. OZ: IS IT?
 THAT IS THE QUESTION.
 LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED WHEN WE
 COMPARED ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR
 BREAKFAST SANDWICHES WITH ONE OF
 THE MOST POPULAR DELUXE BURGERS.
 WHAT DID WE FIND?
 YOU ARE A LITTLE WRONG.
 YOU ARE RIGHT IN TERMS OF.
 IT IS LOWER IN CALORIES AND FAT.
 BUT THE BURGER HAS THE BREAKFAST
 SANDWICH BEAT WHEN IT COMES TO
 PRINTING.
 DR. OZ: IT WINS WITH PROTEIN.
 BUT WHEN IT COMES TO FAT AND
 CALORIES, YOU ARE RIGHT, THIS IS
 LEANER, YOU FEEL BETTER.
 AS A QUICK BITE TO GO, IT WORKS.
 IT IS ABOUT BALANCING WHAT YOU
 EAT THAT DAY.
 DR. OZ: I GO WITH YOU.
 I THINK THE EGG SANDWICH IS
 HEALTHIER.
 YOU HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION.
 I DO.
 I LIKE THE WHOLE SHEBANG ON MY
 BREAKFAST SANDWICHES.
 ARE THE HASHBROWNS HEALTHIER
 THAN FRIES?
 DR. OZ: I BET YOU ALL WANT TO
 KNOW THAT.
 HASHBROWNS OR FRIES, THAT IS THE
 BIG QUESTION.
 WE ARE TALKING ABOUT OTHER FAST
 FOOD BREAKFAST STAPLES INCLUDING
 HASHBROWNS.
 WE ARE GOING TO THROW COFFEE
 INTO IT AS WELL.
 [APPLAUSE]

        I'm a close talker.
  So I was excited about All-New  Colgate Total.
   Its breakthrough formula does   more...
            Wonderful.
     Sensitivity, strengthens     teeth...
 It kills germs through my whole mouth..
      I like your confidence.
          Thanks Mr. Lee!
 Now there's no such thing as too close.
          Yes, there is.
         No, there's not.
           Yes there is.
         No, there's not!
               Okay.
      <i> All-New Colgate Total.</i>
  <i> Do more for your whole mouth.</i>
 I'm not picking it up. You pick it up!
      I'm not picking it up.
 I'll pick it up! They're clean!
     ♪'Cuz my hiney's clean.♪
   ♪Oh yeah I'm Charmin clean.♪
 Charmin Ultra Strong just cleans better.
    Enjoy the Go with Charmin.
 HASHBROWNS AND COFFEE IS THE BEST WAY TO START YOUR DAY.
 ANYTIME OF DAY, ICED COFFEE WITH
 CRISPY HASH BROWN.
 I LOVE THE HASHBROWNS AND THE
 COFFEE.
 HOW COULD YOU SAY NO TO A
 POTATO?
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: WE ARE ABOUT TO REVEAL
 WHETHER HASHBROWNS ARE BETTER
 FOR YOU THAN FRIES.
 I'VE ASKED MEMBERS OF MY
 AUDIENCE TO HOLD UP THE
 INGREDIENTS FOUND IN ONE FAST
 FOOD HASHBROWN.
 ARE YOU READY?

 REVEAL!
 MY GOODNESS.
 WALK US THROUGH THIS.
 IT IS MORE THAN I EXPECTED.
 A LOT OF POTATO, BUT THERE IS
 A LOT OF OTHER STUFF IN HERE.
 NATURAL FLAVOR, DEXTROSE, SALT,
 CITRIC ACID, CORNFLOWER, CANOLA
 OIL, BLACK POWDER EXTRACT,
 SODIUM ACID.
 SOMETHING ELSE NOBODY CAN
 PRONOUNCE.
 THIS IS ALL IN THE HASHBROWNS WE
 ARE LOVING TO CONSUME EVERY
 MORNING.
 DR. OZ: YOU CAN LEARN MORE ABOUT
 HASHBROWNS RIGHT NOW.
 SHE LOVES HER HASHBROWNS.
 SHE WAS ASKING US ABOUT
 HASHBROWNS OR FRENCH FRIES.
 HOW DO YOU COMPARE THEM?
 AFTER YOU SEE THE INGREDIENTS,
 WHAT DO YOU THINK?
 I THOUGHT HASHBROWNS WERE
 BASICALLY POTATOES.
 BUT I DON'T KNOW.
 DR. OZ: UNTIL SHE DID HER
 INVESTIGATION, I THOUGHT IT WAS
 POTATOES AND ONE OR TWO OTHER
 THINGS BUT NOT THE BUNCH OF
 THINGS WE JUST SAW.
 YOU COMPARED THE OPTIONS.
 I KNOW YOU'RE REALLY INTO
 HASHBROWNS.
 AND IT WOULD LOVE TO TELL YOU
 THEY ARE THE CLEAR ANSWER, BUT
 IS ACTUALLY A MIXED BAG.
 HASHBROWNS BEAT OUT FRIES WHEN
 IT COMES TO CALORIES.
 WHEN IT COMES TO SODIUM, THEY
 HAVE A LOT MORE.
 IT IS ABOUT YOUR DIET AND
 HEALTH, WHAT YOU NEED FOR YOUR
 DAY.
 BUT NEITHER ONE OF THEM ARE
 GREAT.
 DR. OZ: YOU CAN DO BETTER.
 LET'S TALK ABOUT THE LAST ALL
 DAY MENU STAPLE, THE COFFEE.
 I LOVE COFFEE.
 I DON'T DRINK MUCH OF IT BUT I
 KNOW IT IS GOOD FOR YOU.
 THINK YOU OUGHT TO DRINK ENOUGH
 OF IT TO FEEL HAPPY IN YOUR
 LIFE.
 WHEN YOU ORDER FROM A FAST FOOD
 CHAIN, YOU GET MORE THAN YOU
 BARGAINED FOR.
 YOU ORDERED REGULAR COFFEE.
 WHAT WENT DOWN?
 I WAS SURPRISED.
 I FELT LIKE I GOT A CUP OF SUGAR
 AND MILK.
 IT WAS A LOT MORE SWEET THE
 NINTH DISSIPATE IT.
 FRANKLY, IT WAS NOT ENJOYABLE.
 I HAVE A FEW HACKS THAT CAN
 HELP.
 DR. OZ: PLEASE.
 IF YOU ARE ORDERING REGULAR
 COFFEE COMING WANT TO ORDER
 AMERICANA.
 THAT WILL BE COFFEE AND WATER.
 YOU CAN ADD OTHER THINGS INTO
 IT.
 IF YOU WANT TO HAVE ICED COFFEE
 WHICH A LOT OF PEOPLE LOVE ALL
 YEAR ROUND, YOU WANT TO MAKE
 SURE YOU ASK FOR REGULAR COFFEE
 AND HAVE IT POURED OVER ICE SO
 IT WILL NOT HAVE EXTRA SUGAR OR
 THE SYRUP AND IT WILL REALLY
 JUST BE COFFEE WHICH IS THE HIGH
 YOU ARE LOOKING FOR.
 YOU ARE NOT LOOKING FOR THE
 OTHER STUFF.
 DR. OZ: THERE ARE WAYS TO GET
 WHAT WE WANT FROM THE FAST FOOD
 CHAINS.
 CUSTOMIZE IT THE WAY YOU WANT
 AND YOU WILL BE HAPPY.
 THERE IS A FULL LIST ON HOW TO
 MAKE YOUR BREAKFAST HEALTHIER AT
 DOCTOROZ.COM.
 WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: NEXT, THE FOOD
 INVESTIGATION INTO CREAM CHEESE.
 IS IT REALLY CHEESE?

  Do you push through migraine?
     Mom, are you OK to play?
 Yeah honey, how about we play...
      princess and pirates?
   Imagine what you can do with   more migraine-free days.
             Arr!
            En garde!
     When you're not fighting     through migraine
    imagine the possibilities.
  Once-monthly Emgality is used  for the prevention
      of migraine in adults.
  It's specifically developed to  help give you
     more migraine-free days.
  With Emgality about 60% of  people had their migraine days
       cut in half or more.
 Do not use if you are allergic to Emgality or its ingredients.
   Emgality may cause allergic   reactions, such as
     itching, rash, hives and     trouble breathing,
 which can happen days after use.
 Call your doctor or get medical help right away
    if you have symptoms of an    allergic reaction.
       The most common side       effects include
    injection site reactions.
   What should we do tomorrow?

     Save up to 30%. Hurry.        Offer ends soon.
 YOU ARE REALLY EATING.
 [APPLAUSE] DR. OZ: CREAM CHEESE IS THE
 BREAKFAST SPREAD THAT MAKES A
 BAGEL SOMETHING YOU CRAVE.
 TODAY, WE INVESTIGATE THE TRUTH
 ABOUT GROCERY STORE CREAM
 CHEESE.
 WHAT IS REALLY IN IT?
 IS IT EVEN REAL CHEESE?
 CHEF IS HERE WITH A CLOSER LOOK.
 AMERICA'S OBSESSED WITH CREAM
 CHEESE.
 WE HAVE THE PASSIONATE FOOD
 FIGHTS TO PROVE IT.
 WALK US THROUGH THE RECENT
 CONTROVERSY OVER THE EMOJI.
 I AM FROM NEW YORK, WE LOVE
 OUR BAGELS HERE.
 [APPLAUSE]
 THERE IS NO CAN CHEESE ON THE
 BAGEL.
 RECENTLY, THEY FIXED IT.
 DR. OZ: THEY HAD TO ADD CREAM
 CHEESE TO MAKE THE EMOJI TRULY A
 BAGEL.
 IT IS LIKE PEANUT BUTTER AND
 JELLY WITHOUT THE PEANUT BUTTER.
 DR. OZ: THERE ARE OTHER FOOD
 FIGHTS YOU HAVE BEEN HEARING
 ABOUT ON TWITTER.
 HERE IS A CLASSIC TWEET.
 DO YOU CONSIDER CREAM CHEESE
 ACTUAL CHEESE?
 #CREAMCHEESEDEBATE.
 WHAT DO THEY MEAN BY CREAM
 CHEESE?
 WHAT IS ACTUALLY IN IT?
 IT IS DIFFERENT FROM MOST
 CHEESES.
 IT IS A NEW CHEESE.
 YOU CAN MAKE CREAM CHEESE IN ONE
 DAY.
 MOST CHEESES ME TO SIT AND
 CULTURE AND FIRM UP.
 A LOT OF OTHER CHEESES, THEY
 AGE.
 THIS IS FRESH, NEW CHEESE.
 THAT IS THE ONLY DIFFERENCE.
 DR. OZ: THE CHEF AND MY TEAM
 WENT THROUGH ALL THE CREAM
 CHEESE TYPES AND DISCOVERED
 SOMETHING YOU MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT
 YOUR FAVORITE SPREAD.
 LET'S TALK ABOUT THE MOST
 POPULAR BRANDS YOU MIGHT
 TYPICALLY BY.
 I KNOW IF YOU GO TO A STORE, IT
 IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT WHEN YOU
 TRY TO BUY A FRESH.
 THIS IS SUPER FANCY.
 YOU WILL NOT RUN INTO THIS MUCH
 UNLESS YOU ARE A HANDS-ON
 RESTAURANT OR NICE BAGEL PLACE.
 THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET
 AT A GROCERY STORE.
 IT IS GOOD QUALITY STUFF.
 WE KNOW WHICH ONE IT IS.
 I LOVE THIS.
 IT IS SIMPLE, HEALTHY.
 THE INGREDIENTS ARE SIMPLE.
 I CAN PRONOUNCE ALL THE STUFF.
 THE WAY PROTEIN IS LIKE
 CONCENTRATED POWDERED MILK.
 XANTHAN GUM IS USED AS A
 STABILIZER.
 TOTALLY FINE, NATURAL.
 DR. OZ: WHEN YOU BUY IT FRESH,
 THEY ADD SELTZER.
 I DID NOT REALIZE THAT.
 THE CARBON DIOXIDE MAKES IT
 AREA.
 THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION
 THAT COMES OUT.
 DR. OZ: HERE IS WHERE THE DEBATE
 STARTS.
 LOW-FAT AND FAT-FREE CREAM
 CHEESE VERSUS THE REGULAR,
 OLD-FASHIONED, FULL FAT STUFF.
 HOW DO THEY MAKE IT LOW-FAT?
 THEY DO NOT ADD IN THE HEAVY
 CREAM.
 IT GETS WEIRD BECAUSE THEY HAVE
 TO START PUTTING OTHER STUFF IN
 LIKE POTASSIUM SORBATE.
 I DON'T REALLY NEED THAT.
 I DON'T NEED HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN
 SYRUP.
 THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE UP FOR
 THE FACT THERE IS NOT FAT IN IT.
 IS NOT FOR ME.
 FOR SOME PEOPLE, IT WORKS.
 DR. OZ: PEOPLE DO IT BECAUSE
 THEY THINK THEY'RE GETTING LESS
 CALORIES.
 IS THAT THE BEST WAY TO HAVE
 YOUR BAGEL WITHOUT THEM -- WITH
 LESS CALORIES?
 WE WILL EXAMINE THAT.
 WHIPPED CREAM CHEESE IS TAKING
 OVER THE COUNTRY.
 THERE IS A REASON FOR THAT.
 SHE IS A BIG FAN.
 HAVE YOU COMPARED TO THE CLASSIC
 AND LOW-FAT?
 I LOVE THE WHIPPED CREAM
 CHEESE BECAUSE IT IS ALREADY
 FLUFFY AND SMOOTH.
 IT IS GREAT FOR SWIRLING IN
 HOMEMADE JAMS.
 IT IS GREAT FOR A QUICK
 FROSTING.
 DR. OZ: IT SPREADS EASILY.
 IT IS GREAT FOR SPREADING.
 I MAKE GREAT DIPS FOR PARTIES.
 IT IS THE PERFECT TEXTURE.
 DR. OZ: LOW-FAT DOES NOT SPREAD
 SO WELL, I SHOULD POINT OUT.
 A LITTLE BIT OF A BATTLE.
 THIS IS THE REGULAR STUFF.
 I'M HAVING TROUBLE WITH THIS
 BECAUSE IT IS TEMPERED.
 TAKE IT OUT AND LET IT SHOW FOR
 A LITTLE WHILE -- CHILL FOR A
 LITTLE WHILE.
 DR. OZ: I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT
 SOMETHING.
 I AM STRUGGLING.
 I AM NOT A FAN OF LOW-FAT
 ANYWAY.
 I WANTED TO GIVE IT A CHANCE.
 I WANTED TO THOROUGHLY
 UNDERSTAND AND TEST WHIPPED
 CREAM CHEESE.
 THERE IS A THEORY THAT WHIPPED
 CREAM CHEESE ALLOWS YOU TO
 CONSUME LESS CALORIES.
 HAVE YOU HEARD THAT?
 I WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT.
 DR. OZ: IS IT REALLY TRUE?
 MY TEAM DID A BAGEL SPREAD
 EXPERIMENT.
 THEY EXPERIMENTED WITH CLASSIC,
 LOW-FAT, AND WHIPPED CREAM
 CHEESE.
 THEY USED A FOOD SCALE TO FIGURE
 OUT HOW MUCH CREAM CHEESE YOU
 ARE SPREADING ON A WHOLE BAGEL.
 FOR THE CLASSIC CREAM CHEESE,
 YOU SPREAD AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT
 ONE TABLESPOON.
 1.5 ROUGHLY.
 ABOUT 160 CALORIES.
 LOW-FAT, ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT.
 1.5 TABLESPOONS, ABOUT 120
 CALORIES.
 IT IS LESS CALORIES.
 HERE IS WHERE IT GOT
 INTERESTING.
 WHIPPED CREAM CHEESE.
 YOU'RE ACTUALLY SPREADING MORE,
 ABOUT TWO TABLESPOONS.
 WE ONLY GET 95 CALORIES.
 YOU GET MORE CREAM CHEESE BUT
 FEWER CALORIES.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: YOUR FAMILY KNOWS WHAT
 THEY ARE DOING.
 ARGUE HAPPY?
 --ART YOU HAPPY?
 I AM ECSTATIC.
 DR. OZ: I HAVE MADE TODAY FOR A
 LOT OF AMERICANS.
 I FEEL LIKE I'M PAYING FOR
 AIR.
 THERE SHOULD BE FREE.
 JUST MY THING.
 DR. OZ: AIR COMES IN HANDY IN
 LIFE.
 BUT TALK ABOUT THE FLAVORED
 CREAM CHEESE -- LET'S TALK ABOUT
 THE FLAVORED CREAM CHEESES.
 ARE YOU GETTING REAL
 STRAWBERRIES IN YOUR STRAWBERRY
 CREAM CHEESE?
 YES, BUT YOU ARE ALSO GETTING
 A LOT OF STUFF.
 I DON'T NEED RED 40 DYE.
 I AM OK WITH THE FRUIT JUICE AND
 VEGETABLE JUICE.
 THE CORN SYRUP, AGAIN, EH.
 I AM NOT A HUGE FAN.
 YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN, MAN.
 DR. OZ: SHOW US HOW TO DO IT.
 YOU WANT THAT TASTE SOMETIMES.
 YOUR CREAM CHEESE ALREADY
 TEMPERED.
 STRAWBERRIES I CHOPPED UP
 EARLIER.
 YOU CAN POP A COUPLE OF THOSE IN
 THEIR.
 DR. OZ: IS THAT JAM?
 THAT IS JIM.
 THAT IS A LIFE HACK.
 I USE THAT AT HOME ALL THE TIME.
 DR. OZ: STRAWBERRIES, YOU KNOW
 WHAT YOU ARE ADDING.
 WHAT IS THAT?
 SOUR CREAM AND CHIVES.
 DR. OZ: YOU PUT POTATO CHIPS IN?
 YOU COULD.
 THOSE ARE THE OG CLASSIC.
 LIKE 15 SECONDS, DONE.
 DR. OZ: THERE IS ONE OTHER HACK
 I'M GOING TO ASK YOU ABOUT.
 A LOT OF PEOPLE TAKE THE BREAD
 OUT OF THE BAGEL.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK?
 MY GIRLFRIEND -- MY
 EX-GIRLFRIEND USED TO DO THAT.
 [LAUGHTER]
 DR. OZ: THAT GIVES YOU AN IDEA
 OF WHAT HE THINKS.
 HIS EX-GIRLFRIEND USED TO DO
 THAT.
 DID NOT WORK OUT SO WELL.
 IT MAKES SENSE.
 I NEED EVERY CALORIE I CAN GET.
 IF YOU WANT TO CUT CALORIES OR
 CARBS, YOU CAN DO IT.
 DR. OZ: WITH WHIPPED CREAM
 CHEESE, YOU ARE OK WITH ALL OF
 THAT?
 I AM OK.
 THE ONLY ONE THAT WEIRDS ME OUT
 IS THE LOW-FAT BECAUSE OF THE
 CHEMICALS.
 DR. OZ: TAKE THE MAN'S ADVICE.
 WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
 [APPLAUSE]

 DR. OZ: WHEN THE CAMERAS STOP ROLLING, I STILL HAVE A LOT I
 WANT TO
 ROLLING, I STILL HAVE A LOT I

 DR. OZ: I'M FEELING A LITTLE TIRED.
 I WONDER IF I SHOULD GET SOME
 COFFEE OR GO RIGHT TO THE PLANE.

 DR. OZ: I STILL WANT COFFEE. I WONDER IF I SHOULD GET IT ON
 THE FLIGHT OR WAIT UNTIL I GET
 HOME.

 DR. OZ: I STILL FEEL LIKE COFFEE.

 DR. OZ: I FEEL LIKE SOMEONE IS CHOOSING FOR ME.
 DR. OZ: A LITTLE ODE TO THE
 NETFLIX SERIES ALL IN GOOD FUN.
 ACTUALLY, YOU DO HAVE TO DECIDE.
 OTHER PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO DO
 IT FOR YOU.
 AS WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING THIS
 FEBRUARY, GERMS ARE LURKING IN
 PLACES YOU WOULD NEVER EXPECT.
 TODAY, WE ARE INVESTIGATING
 WHETHER YOUR DRINKING COFFEE
 THAT IS FILTHY.
 WE HAVE THREE WOMEN WHO SAY THEY
 ARE CONCERNED THAT THERE ARE
 HIDDEN GERMS IN THE PLACES THEY
 TURN FOR A QUICK CUP.
 SHE WANTS TO KNOW ABOUT GAS
 STATION COFFEE.
 WHAT IS WORRYING YOU?
 EVERY TIME I GO INTO A GAS
 STATION AND I NEED COFFEE, THERE
 IS SO MUCH COFFEE.
 I GO BACK AND HOUR LATER, AND
 THERE STILL A WHOLE POT OF
 COFFEE BUT I NEVER SEE ANYONE
 CHANGE IT.
 I NEVER SEE ANYONE CLEAN AROUND
 IT.
 I'M THINKING.
 DR. OZ: HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED
 WHY THERE IS SO MUCH COFFEE
 READY TO GO?
 SHE WANTS TO KNOW ABOUT AIRPLANE
 COFFEE.
 WHAT WORRIES YOU?
 YOU JUST SAW MY LITTLE PARODY.
 THE NUMBER ONE THING IT SEEMS
 LIKE THE VIRAL STORIES FROM
 PILOTS WERE ATTENDANCE, THEY SAY
 DO NOT DRINK THE COFFEE ON THE
 PLANE.
 I NEED CAFFEINE WHEN I HAVE NOT
 SLEPT AND I TRAVEL.
 DR. OZ: YOU HAVE TO DECIDE ALL
 BY YOURSELF.
 NO ONE IS GOING TO DO IT FOR
 YOU.
 SHE WAS TO KNOW ABOUT COFFEE
 FROM BIG CHAIN PLACES.
 YOUR CONCERN?
 THEY MOVE SO QUICKLY BETWEEN
 ORDERS.
 HOW DO WE KNOW A QUICK WRENCH --
 RENTS GETS THE MACHINES CLEAN?
 DR. OZ: THREE, PLACES WE GET
 COFFEE.
 FOR FILTHY FEBRUARY, WE ARE
 PUTTING IT UNDER THE MICROSCOPE
 WITH THE AUTHOR OF "THE COFFEE
 LOVERS BIBLE."
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: THE MEDICAL DOCTOR SO
 EXCITED ABOUT THE HEALTH
 BENEFITS OF COFFEE, HERE TO TALK
 TO YOU ABOUT ALL THE QUESTIONS
 WE HAVE BEEN RAISING.
 FIRST OFF, GAS STATION COFFEE.
 I'M CURIOUS WHAT YOU THINK.
 HOW LONG DOES THAT POT OF COFFEE
 STAY OUT BEFORE THEY CHANGE IT?
 IT COULD BE 30 MINUTES OR
 EIGHT HOURS AT AN OUT-OF-THE-WAY
 PLACE.
 THERE ARE SOME COFFEE STATIONS
 THAT HAVE FANTASTIC COFFEE.
 IF IT HAS BEEN THERE FOR EIGHT
 HOURS, IT GETS REALLY STALE AND
  TASTES TERRIBLE.
 DR. OZ: HE IS A PILOT, AN
 AIRPLANE PILOT.
 YOU FLEW YOURSELF HERE TODAY,
 I'M TOLD.
 WHO BETTER TO ASK?
 WE ARE INVESTIGATING COFFEE ON
 AIRPLANES.
 HERE IS THE THING.
 COFFEE IN AIRPLANES HAS BEEN ALL
 OVER THE NEWS.
 EVEN PILOTS ARE COMING OUT
 AGAINST IT.
 EXPLAIN AS A PILOT HOW THEY MAKE
 THE COFFEE WE DRINK ON PLANES.
 IT SAYS POTABLE WATER ON THE
 TRUCK.
 IT IS A LOCAL WATER SUPPLY.
 WHEREVER IT IS, THAT IS THE
 WATER YOU GET.
 DR. OZ: BOLIVIA?
 IT COULD BE COMING FROM SOME
 OTHER PLACE.
 WHO KNOWS WHERE THE WATER CAME
 FROM?
 DR. OZ: THIS WATER FROM THE
 LOCAL SUPPLY, THEY PUT IT IN THE
 PLANE.
 THEY LOADED INTO THE
 AIRPLANE.
 THIS IS USED IN THE COFFEE MAKER
 ON THE AIRPLANE.
 THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
 SAYS 158 DEGREES KILLS ALMOST
 ANYTHING.
 THERE IS ALL THIS WORRY AND
 CONCERN.
 THERE ARE OLDER STUDIES THAT
 HAVE SHOWN A LOT OF BACTERIA IN
 THE WATER.
 BY THE TIME THAT HAS SAT THERE
 AT 180 DEGREES FOR FOUR OR FIVE
 HOURS, IT DOES NOT TASTE GREAT
 BUT IS LIKELY SAFE.
 DR. OZ: THEORETICALLY, IT WILL
 BE OK.
 IS THAT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU?
 NO.
 WE WANTED TO FIND OUT THE TRUTH.
 WHEN IT SITS FOR A COUPLE OF
 DAYS, CAN IT BE AN ISSUE?
 IT GETS PEOPLE CONCERNED.
 WE DID OUR OWN TESTING.
 IT SEEMS LIKE THE AIRPLANE
 COFFEE PANIC IS OVERBLOWN.
 THE DATA SHOWS THINGS HAVE
 IMPROVED.
 FINDING CONTAMINATED WATER IS
 REALLY RARE.
 I THINK WE WOULD SEE MORE PEOPLE
 GETTING SICK IF IT WAS TRULY A
 PROBLEM.
 I SAY AIRPLANE COFFEE IS CLEARED
 FOR DRINKING.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: PEOPLE ALL AROUND ME ON
 THE FLIGHT WERE DRINKING COFFEE.
 NEXT THING DR. ARNOLD LOOKED
 INTO WAS COFFEE'S FROM BIG CHAIN
 BRANDS.
 WE ASKED A WHISTLEBLOWER WHO WAS
 A BARISTA FOR YEARS TO REVEAL A
 SOB BEHIND THE BAR.
 I USED TO WORK IN A COFFEE
 SHOP FOR ABOUT 10 YEARS.
 I HAVE SEEN SOME REALLY FILTHY
 THINGS IN MY TIME.
 I HAVE SEEN THINGS NOT IF IT
 WERE THE WHOLE PLACE SMELLS LIKE
 ROTTEN NEXT.
 I HAVE FOUND FOOD IN
 REFRIGERATOR WAY BACK.
 I HAVE SEEN PEOPLE SERVE EXPIRED
 MILK.
 I HAVE WATCHED PEOPLE GET
 REVENGE ON OTHER PEOPLE THAT
 MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN THEM UPSET.
 I'VE SEEN SOMEONE HOCK A LOOGEE
 INTO SOMEONE ELSE'S FOOD.
 ONE TIME, A COWORKER OF MINE WAS
 SO UPSET THEY DECIDED TO PUT A
 HEALTHY AMOUNT OF EPSOM SALTS
 INTO A POT OF COFFEE AND
 PROCEEDED TO GET EVERY CUSTOMER
 THAT CAME FOR COFFEE THAT DAY
 SICK.
 I'M SURE YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF
 SICK I AM TALKING ABOUT.
 DR. OZ: ACCORDING TO ONE REPORT,
 YOU MAY BE BETTER OFF ORDERING
 HOT COFFEE.
 NOT JUST FOR THE REASONS WE
 HEARD.
 TESTING IN THE U.K. FOUND E.
 COLI IN THE ICE.
 IN THE ICE ITSELF.
 NOT THE COFFEE, BUT THE ICE.
 THAT IS SOMETHING YOU NEVER
 WANT.
 YOU NEVER WANT E. COLI IN YOUR
 ICED COFFEE.
 ONE MORE COFFEE LEFT TO
 INVESTIGATE.
 THE KIND BREWED AT HOME.
 IS IT THE TRADITIONAL POT KIND?
 FIND OUT THE RESULTS OF OUR
 TESTING WHEN WE COME BACK.

 <i> Stouffer's Lasagna With Meat &</i>              <i> Sauce</i>

        <i> When you're doing</i>       <i> it alone, be strong.</i>
           Thanks, dad.
     <i> Life takes softness and</i>      <i> strength, which is why</i>
        <i> we make Angel Soft</i>     <i> with a balance of both.</i>
       I'm a close talker.
  So I was excited about All-New  Colgate Total.
  Its breakthrough formula does  more...
            Wonderful.
     Sensitivity, strengthens     teeth...
 It kills germs through my whole mouth..
     I like your confidence.
         Thanks Mr. Lee!
 Now there's no such thing as too close.
          Yes, there is.
         No, there's not.
          Yes there is.
         No, there's not!
              Okay.
      <i> All-New Colgate Total.</i>
  <i> Do more for your whole mouth.</i>

    Oats have a soluble fiber       called beta-glucan,
 which can help lower cholesterol
          when part of a       heart-healthy diet.
     What's more, these oats   have no artificial flavors,
  preservatives or added colors.
       Now that's something          to celebrate.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: WE ARE BACK WITH THE
 DIRT ON FILTHY COFFEE.
 WE ARE PUTTING YOUR OWN
 HOMEBREWED COFFEE POT UNDER THE
 MICROSCOPE.
 WHICH IS GERMIER?
 THE TRADITIONAL OR POD KIND?
 FROM THEIR VERY OWN KITCHEN,
 RYAN, YOU DESCRIBE YOURSELF AS
 AN OLD-SCHOOL CUP OF JOE KIND OF
 GUY.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT COFFEE
 MAKER?
 I TELL YOU, I HAVE THREE
 WORDS TO DESCRIBE WHAT I THINK
 ABOUT THIS LITTLE MACHINE RIGHT
 HERE.
 PACIFIC GARBAGE PATCH.
 ALL THE PLASTICS RIGHT HERE.
 THAT IS THE WHOLE REASON I DON'T
 DEAL WITH THIS THING RIGHT HERE.
 DR. OZ: THE AUDIENCE IS
 APPLAUDING YOU.
 YOU SAY THE COFFEE MAKER IS NOT
 THE GERM MACHINE YOUR HUSBAND
 THINKS IT IS.
 IT MIGHT NOT BE AS GREEN, BUT IS
 IT BETTER?
 IT IS BETTER.
 FIRST OF ALL, I CANNOT BELIEVE
 WHAT YOU JUST SAID ABOUT MY
 PRECIOUS POD STYLE MACHINE.
 YOU CAN HAVE IT FRESH AND HOT.
 IT HAS NOT SAT AROUND ALL DAY.
 THIS IS A FRESH CUP PERSONALLY
 FOR YOU.
 I AM TRADITIONAL.
 I LIKE MY COFFEE LIKE MYSELF,
 BLACK AND STRONG.
 [LAUGHTER]
 [APPLAUSE]
 THIS IS ALL I NEED RIGHT
 HERE.
 DR. OZ: TODAY, WE ARE GOING TO
 SETTLE THE SCORE ONCE AND FOR
 ALL BECAUSE WE DID A GERM TEST
 TO FIND OUT WHICH COFFEEMAKERS
 ARE GERMIER.
 WHICH COFFEEMAKERS YOU THINK IS
 GOING TO BE MORE FILTHY?
 HERS.
 HIS.
 HERS.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: WE WILL HAVE THE RESULTS
 IN A MOMENT.
 FIRST, WE BREAK DOWN THE SCIENCE
 BETWEEN THESE OPTIONS.
 PEOPLE ARE FIGHTING IN THEIR
 HOMES OVER THIS.
 WE CANNOT DECIDE.
 WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT
 COFFEEMAKERS.
 I'M GOING TO WALK THROUGH THESE.
 DR. OZ: YOU ARE PRETTY GOOD AT
 THIS STUFF.
 YOU UNDERSTAND ALL THESE THINGS.
 BASIC MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT THESE
 OPTIONS.
 HOW DO YOU CLEAN THIS AND THAT?
 YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO CLEAN IT
 REGULARLY LIKE ANY OTHER ITEM.
 WITH THE POD STYLE MACHINE, YOU
 CAN PULL THIS OUT, PULL THE TRAY
 OUT.
 PULL OUT THE WATER THING.
 YOU CAN PUT IT IN YOUR
 DISHWASHER.
 THERE IS A CLEANING POD YOU CAN
 PUT IN HERE.
 ANY HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCE YOU
 TOUCH A LOT, YOU WANT TO WASH
 OFF.
 DR. OZ: MY WIFE USES A
 TOOTHBRUSH.
 SHE DID SEEING HERE --SHE GETS
 IN HERE WITH A LITTLE
 TOOTHBRUSH.
 IT WORKS WELL.
 YOU WANT TO CLEAN THROUGH
 HERE ALL THE DIRTY PARTS.
 DR. OZ: WHAT A METICULOUS DOCTOR

 HOW DO YOU CLEAN THE
 OLD-FASHIONED ONE?
 SAME THING.
 YOU WANT TO USE WHITE VINEGAR
 WHICH IS VERY ACIDIC.
 YOU CAN TAKE THESE PIECES OUT.
 PUT IT IN YOUR WASHING MACHINE.
 THAT IS THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT.
 DO IT EVERY DAY.
 DR. OZ: EVERY DAY YOU DO THAT?
 YOU SHOULD.
 DR. OZ: WHO CLEANS THEIR COFFEE
 MAKER EVERY DAY?
 SEE?
 DR. OZ: ONE FAMILY IN THE BACK.
 [LAUGHTER]
 DR. OZ: ALL THE OTHER 90
 FAMILIES DO NOT DO THAT.
 DO IT REGULARLY.
 BETWEEN 40 AND 80 BREWS YOU
 SHOULD DO IT.
 YOU PUT THE VINEGAR IN HERE AND
 YOU BREW IT THROUGH.
 LET IT SIT FOR HALF AN HOUR.
 THAT IS THE WAY YOU CLEAN THAT
 MACHINE.
 GREAT TASTING COFFEE.
 DR. OZ: DON'T MOVE.
 RYAN, THIS COULD CHANGE
 EVERYTHING.
 WE TESTED COFFEE MADE FROM BOTH
 TYPES OF MACHINES WE HAVE IN THE
 STUDIO.
 WE JUST WENT OVER THEM.
 AT ONE END OF THE GERM CHART IS
 A TOILET SEAT.
 THE OTHER SIDE HAS A WHISTLE
 MEANING CLEAN AS A WHISTLE.
 YOU SEE THE RESULTS?
 LELET'S SEE THE RESULTS.
 THERE GOES.
 BOTH COFFEES CAME OUT GERM FREE.
 THEY ARE BOTH FINE.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: USE THE TRICKS HE JUST
 GAVE YOU TO KEEP YOUR SPEAK AND
 SPAN COFFEE MAKER INTACT.
 IT WILL TASTE BETTER AND BE
 BETTER FOR YOU.
 NO MATTER WHAT KIND YOU HAVE, IT
 IS WORTH THE INVESTMENT OF
 EFFORT.
 WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
 [APPLAUSE]


          Let's face it,
            the world
      could use some warmth.

    The in-laws have moved in    with us.
 And our adult children are here.
    So we save by using Tide.
     Which means we use less.

 [APPLAUSE] DR. OZ: IT IS A CHRONIC AND
 ABILITY HITTING CONDITION THAT
 MAKES SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS
 BREATHING A CHALLENGE.
 WE ARE TALKING ABOUT CHRONIC
 ABSTRACT OF PULMONARY DISEASE
 MORE COMMONLY KNOWN AS COPD.
 IT AFFECTS NEARLY 27.7 MILLION
 PEOPLE.
 OF THAT 27.7 MILLION, MORE THAN
 12 MILLION ARE UNDIAGNOSED WHICH
 IS WHY TODAY I'M BREAKING DOWN
 WHAT COPD IS AND WHY IT IS ON
 THE RISE IN THIS COUNTRY.
 TO HELP SHED LIGHT ON THE TOPIC
 IS THE DOCTOR HERE ON BEHALF OF
 MY SPONSOR PARTNER.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: LET'S START WITH THE
 BASIC ISSUE OF WHAT COPD IS.
 EVERYONE HAS HEARD OF IT BECAUSE
 PEOPLE HAVE IT.
 WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO A
 PULMONOLOGIST?
 IT IS A CHRONIC DISEASE.
 IT INCLUDES CHRONIC BRONCHITIS
 AND EMPHYSEMA.
 IT OCCURS BECAUSE OF THE
 ENVIRONMENT.
 IT IS PROGRESSIVE BECAUSE THE
 SYMPTOMS PROGRESS OVER TIME AND
 THE LUNG DAMAGE CANNOT BE
 REVERSED.
 AS THE DISEASE PROGRESSES, IT IS
 HARDER TO BREATHE AND YOU CANNOT
 PERFORM YOUR DAILY ACTIVITIES.
 DR. OZ: HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE
 HEARD OF COPD?
 LITERALLY EVERY PERSON IN THE
 AUDIENCE.
 IT IS IMPORTANT IF YOU HAVE COPD
 TO KNOW YOUR SYMPTOMS AND
 TREATMENT PROPERLY WITHOUT
 IGNORING THEM.
 EXPLAIN TO FOLKS EXACTLY WHAT
 THE SYMPTOMS ARE.
 I'M GOING TO WALK THEM THROUGH
 WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THEIR
 BODIES.
 THE SYMPTOMS THAT MOST PEOPLE
 SHOULD BE LOOKING OUT FOR OUR
 SHORTNESS OF BREATH, WHICH WILL
 IMPACT THEIR DAILY LIVING.
 THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PERFORM
 EVERYDAY ACTIVITIES.
 MORE IMPORTANTLY, THEY MIGHT
 FEEL TIRED.
 IT IS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL THAT
 THEY DO NOT ATTRIBUTE IT TO JUST
 GETTING OLDER.
 THE THINGS THEY NEED TO LOOK OUT
 FOR OUR CHRONIC COUGH, WHEEZING.
 DR. OZ: LET ME SHOW EVERYBODY
 WHAT IS HAPPENING WHEN YOU HAVE
 COPD IN YOUR LUNGS.
 IT CAN MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO
 BREATHE.
 IT GETS WORSE OVER TIME WHICH
 MAKES YOU UNHAPPY.
 EVERYBODY TAKE A DEEP BREATH IN.
 AS THE AIR PASSES THROUGH YOUR
 NOSE INTO YOUR WINDPIPE DOWN
 INTO YOUR LUNGS, WHEN IT GETS TO
 YOUR LUNGS, HE GOES INTO TINY
 AIR SACS.
 THERE ARE MILLIONS OF THESE
 CALLED ALVEOLA.
 THEY FILL UP.
 WHEN THE BREATH GOES OUT, THEY
 ARE FINE.
 IF IT GETS SICK, THE WALLS
 BECOME SWOLLEN.
 THE MUSCLES SQUEEZE THE AIRWAYS
 MAKING IT HARD FOR THE AIR TO
 GET OUT.
 THEY ACTUALLY TRACK AIR
 SOMETIMES.
 THAT MAKES IT HARD FOR YOU TO
 BREATHE.
 WHAT CAUSES COPD?
 YOU MENTION IT COULD BE
 ENVIRONMENTAL TOXINS AND THE
 LIKE.
 WHAT IS HAPPENING INSIDE OF US?
 OVER TIME, YOUR BREATHING
 EVERY DAY AIR.
 OVER TIME, LUNG IRRITANTS CAN
 CAUSE IRRITATION OF THE INNER
 LINING OF YOUR LUNGS AND
 AIRWAYS.
 WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING IS YOU
 ARE HAVING MORE AND MORE
 DIFFICULTY TO BREATHE AND YOUR
 SYMPTOMS WORSEN OVER TIME LIKE I
 SAID EARLIER.
 THE MOST IMPORTANT PART TO
 RECALL IS COPD IS MAINLY CAUSED
 BY NICOTINE IN CIGARETTES
 SMOKING.
 HOWEVER, YOU MUST REMEMBER
 NON-SMOKERS CAN GET COPD, TOO.
 THE AIR YOU BREATHE EVERY DAY
 OUTSIDE, AT WORK, AT HOME, MAY
 CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF
 COPD.
 LONG-TIME EXPOSURE TO FUMES,
 DUST, AIR POLLUTION, SECONDHAND
 SMOKE, CHEMICALS IN THE SETTING
 OF WORK, WORK RELATED INJURIES
 DEFINITELY, CAN ALSO CAUSE COPD.
 DR. OZ: THINGS YOU MAY HAVE DONE
 TO YOURSELF, THINGS YOU MAY HAVE
 NO IDEA CONTRIBUTE.
 KNOW THE SYMPTOMS AND GET
 ACTIVE.
 THE SYMPTOMS OF COPD ARE
 TREATABLE.
 THERE ARE MANY TREATMENT OPTIONS
 AVAILABLE.
 LAST YEAR, A TREATMENT OPTION
 WAS APPROVED THAT MAY BE ABLE TO
 HELP COPD.
 TELL US ABOUT IT.
 THE INHALATION SOLUTION IS A
 MAINTENANCE MEDICATION FOR THE
 TREATMENT OF COPD SYMPTOMS.
 IT IS PRETTY EASY TO TAKE.
 YOU TAKE IT TWICE A DAY.
 MAKE SURE YOU ACTUALLY USE IT
 WITHOUT USING ANOTHER TYPE.
 MORE IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER IS IT
 IS NOT A MEDICATION TO TREAT
 SUDDEN ONSET SYMPTOMS OF COPD.
 DR. OZ: THIS IS THE DEVICE.
 SHOW ME HOW YOU USE THIS TWICE A
 DAY.
 YOU USE IT TWICE A DAY.
 THE ADMINISTRATION TAKES TWO TO
 THREE MINUTES.
 IT IS NOT LONG WITH PROPER
 ASSEMBLY AND CLEANING.
 WHEN YOU ASSEMBLE IT, YOU END UP
 CLICKING THIS IN.
 THE MEDICATION IS RIGHT IN HERE.
 YOU HOLD THE HANDSET BODY.
 YOU CLOSE YOUR LIPS AROUND THE
 MOUTHPIECE, MAKING SURE YOU DO
 NOT COVER THE BLUE FLAP.
 WHEN YOU ARE READY, YOU PUT THE
 MOUTHPIECE IN YOUR LIPS AND
 BRIEF IN AND OUT.
 TO INITIATE IT, YOU PUSH ON THE
 BLACK BUTTON.
 DR. OZ: THIS IS THE MOTOR.
 YES.
 THE GREEN LIGHT TURNS ON,
 EXACTLY.
 YOU HEARD THE BEEP.
 DR. OZ: YES.
 IT IS VIRTUALLY SILENT.
 YOU BREATHE IN AND OUT UNTIL IT
 IS DONE.
 IT HELPS RELAX THE MUSCLES IN
 THE INNER WINDPIPE.
 DR. OZ: SIMPLE.
 VERY SIMPLE.
 IT IS SMALL.
 YOU CAN USE IT BY PLUGGING IT
 IN, USING BATTERIES.
 VERY EASY TO TRANSPORT.
 YOU CAN PUT IT IN A CARRY-ON BAG
 AND TAKE IT WITH YOU.
 DR. OZ: WHAT DO YOU PRESCRIBE IT
 FOR IN YOUR PRACTICE?
 IT IS PRESCRIBED FOR PATIENTS
 WHO SUFFER FROM COPD THAT NEED A
 MAINTENANCE THERAPY LONG-TERM
 FOR THEIR COPD SYMPTOMS.
 THOSE PATIENTS PREFER TO USE
 MEDICATION BY BREATHING
 NATURALLY.
 ALSO, THOSE PATIENTS MIGHT HAVE
 ISSUES USING OTHER COPD DEVICES.
 DR. OZ: SIDE EFFECTS, THING
 STORY ABOUT?
 THE MOST COMMON SIDE EFFECTS,
 SHORTNESS OF BREATH AND URINARY
 TRACT INFECTION.
 LONG-TERM, THEY CAN CAUSE
 SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS ALSO THAT
 YOU MUST BE AWARE OF AND DISCUSS
 WITH YOUR PHYSICIAN BEFORE
 INITIATING IT.
 MOST IMPORTANT ONES ARE
 SHORTNESS OF BREATH IMMEDIATELY
 AFTER USING IT.
 SERIOUS ALLERGIC REACTIONS CAN
 OCCUR ALSO.
 SOMETIMES YOU HAVE WORSENING OR
 NEW ONSET EYE ISSUES LIKE NARROW
 ANGLE GLAUCOMA, ACUTE NARROW
 ANGLE GLAUCOMA.
 THE SECOND THING THAT CAN HAPPEN
 IS URINARY RETENTION.
 YOU MIGHT HAVE ONSET OR
 PROGRESSION OF URINARY RETENTION
 BLADDER ISSUES.
 WHEN THE ADMINISTRATION IS DONE,
 TWO BEEPS AND THE LIGHT GOES
 OFF.
 DR. OZ: THE TIME IT TOOK YOU TO
 DESCRIBE IT, IT IS ALREADY DONE.
 THE SIDE EFFECTS ARE LISTED
 ONLINE.
 YOU CAN ALSO FIND COPD
 INFORMATION THERE.
 DR. OZ: YOU CAN ALSO GO TO
 DOCTOROZ.COM FOR MORE
 INFORMATION ABOUT COPD.
 I WILL BE RIGHT BACK.

  Do you push through migraine?
     Mom, are you OK to play?
 Yeah honey, how about we play...
      princess and pirates?
   Imagine what you can do with   more migraine-free days.
             Arr!
            En garde!
     When you're not fighting     through migraine
    imagine the possibilities.
  Once-monthly Emgality is used  for the prevention
      of migraine in adults.
  It's specifically developed to  help give you
     more migraine-free days.
  With Emgality about 60% of  people had their migraine days
       cut in half or more.
 Do not use if you are allergic to Emgality or its ingredients.
   Emgality may cause allergic   reactions, such as
     itching, rash, hives and     trouble breathing,
 which can happen days after use.
 Call your doctor or get medical help right away
    if you have symptoms of an    allergic reaction.
       The most common side       effects include
    injection site reactions.
   What should we do tomorrow?
 Ask your doctor about Emgality.

 [APPLAUSE] DR. OZ: THIS IS BABY LUCY.
 SHE AND HER TWIN SISTER EVA WERE
 BORN AT JUST 29 WEEKS.
 DUE TO COMPLICATIONS, LUCY WAS
 LEFT WITH CHRONIC LUNG DISEASE.
 SHE GREW UP A CHEERFUL BABY,
 PLAYING WITH HER SISTER, MAKING
 HER PARENTS LACK.
 SHE HAS TO USE OXYGEN
 CONCENTRATOR.
 SHE AND HER MOTHER WERE HEADED
 TO THE HOSPITAL WHEN THEY GOT ON
 THE PLANE.
 A STRANGER STEPPED IN WITH AN
 ACT OF KINDNESS SPARKING A
 SOCIAL MEDIA POST THAT HAS GONE
 TO INSPIRE MILLIONS.
 WE ARE JOINED TODAY BY THEM AS
 WELL AS THE STRANGER.
 WHAT HAPPENED ON THE PLANE THAT
 DAY THAT MOVED YOU TO TEARS?
 WE WERE TRAVELING TO THE
 CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL.
 WE WERE GOING TO MEET SOME
 DOCTORS THERE.
 WE BOARDED THE PLANE AND GOT
 SETTLED.
 A FLIGHT ATTENDANT CAME BACK AND
 SAID SOMEONE WANTED TO SWITCH
 SEATS WITH US.
 SHE SAID THE MAN WAS IN 2D.
 IT HAPPENED TO BE A FIRST-CLASS
 SEAT HE WAS GIVING UP FOR US.
 DR. OZ: JASON, WHAT MADE YOU
 GIVE UP YOUR SEAT?
 YOU WERE SITTING IN FIRST CLASS
 MINDING HER OWN BUSINESS.
 WHAT WENT DOWN?
 I HAD BEEN FLYING IN AND OUT
 OF THE AIRPORT FOR A COUPLE OF
 MONTHS.
 YOU SEE A LOT OF SICK CHILDREN
 OWING TO DISNEY.
 USUALLY, THERE IS AN ENTOURAGE
 OF PEOPLE.
 KELSEY WAS ALL BY HERSELF WITH
 LUCY.
 IT JUST SEEMED LIKE THE RIGHT
 THING TO DO.
 DR. OZ: CONGRATULATIONS TO BOTH
 OF YOU.
 KELSEY, YOU AND LUCY, WE WANT
 YOU TO FLY AND COMFORT TO NEXT
 APPOINTMENT.
 OUR FRIENDS AT CHILDREN'S LIGHT
 OF HOPE AND AMERICAN AIRLINES
 AGREED.
 THEY WILL MAKE SURE YOUR NEXT
 FLIGHT WITH LUCY IS FIRST-CLASS.
 THEY HAVE AGREED ALSO TO COVER
 ALL REMAINING FLIGHTS TO
 CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF
 PENNSYLVANIA AFTER THAT.
 DOES THAT SOUND GOOD?
 [APPLAUSE]
 OH, MY GOODNESS.
 DR. OZ: I HOPE YOU ENJOY THE
 FLIGHT.
 I HOPE YOU HAVE A GOOD TIME WITH
 YOUR PASSENGER.
 JASON, THANK YOU FOR DOING WHAT
 YOU DID.
 SHE LOOKS HAPPY.
 SHE IS REALLY HAPPY.
 DR. OZ: TOGETHER, CHANGE IS
 HAPPENING.
 OUR JOURNEY IS JUST BEGINNING.
