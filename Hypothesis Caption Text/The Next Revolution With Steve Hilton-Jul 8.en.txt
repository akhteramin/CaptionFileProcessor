 TROOPS STILL SERVING AT THIS MOMENT SO WE CAN LIVE FREE.
 GOD BLESS TEXAS.



 GOOD EVENING AND WELCOME TO
 THE NEXT REVOLUTION.
 I'M STEVE HILTON.
 WORKER, PROFAMILY, PRO-
 COMMUNITY AND ALWAYS BUT
 ESPECIALLY ON THIS JULY 4
 HOLIDAY WEEKEND, PRO-
 AMERICA.
 THAT'S WHERE WE START
 TONIGHT.
 THERE WAS A TIME WHEN BEING
 PROAMERICAN.
 [INAUDIBLE]
 PRESIDENT REAGAN PUT IT
 BEAUTIFULLY WHEN HE TALKED OF
 A SHINING CITY ON THE HILL.
 I ALSO LOVED BILL CLINTON'S
 GREAT LINE, THERE'S NOTHING
 WRONG WITH AMERICA THAT CAN'T
 BE FIXED BY WHAT'S RIGHT WITH
 AMERICA.
 THIS WEEK WE STILL HAVE A
 REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT WHO LIKE
 RONALD REAGAN IS PROUD OF
 AMERICA AND HAPPY TO SAY IT,
 TO CELEBRATE IT BUT TODAY'S
 DEMOCRATS, NO THEY'RE
 EMBARRASSED BY AMERICA.
 FAR FROM CELEBRATING, THEY
 WANT TO TEAR DOWN AND TURN IT
 INTO SOMETHING ELSE.
 THAT'S THE BACKGROUND TO THE
 SALUTE TO AMERICA ON
 INDEPENDENCE DAY.
 THE DEMOCRATS COULDN'T WAIT TO
 ATTACK IT.
 I DON'T THINK HE GETS IT.
 HE DOESN'T GET IT.
 OKAY LOOK, HERE'S SOME OF WHAT
 THE PRESIDENT ACTUALLY SAID.
 TOGETHER WE ARE PART OF ONE OF
 THE GREATEST STORIES EVER
 TOLD, THE STORY OF AMERICA.
 IT IS THE SPIRIT DURING AND
 DEFIANCE, EXCELLENCE AND
 ADVENTURE, COURAGE AND
 CONFIDENCE, LOYALTY AND LOVE
 THAT BUILT THIS COUNTRY INTO
 THE MOST EXCEPTIONAL NATION IN
 THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD AND
 OUR NATION IS STRONGER TODAY
 THAN IT EVER WAS BEFORE.
 I THINK YOU WILL FIND JOE
 CHINA THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP
 GETS WHAT MAKES AMERICA GREAT
 BETTER THAN A SWAMP CREATURE
 WHO TOOK BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
 IN BRIBES IN THE FORM OF
 PAYMENT TO HIS FAMILY
 BUSINESSES FROM AMERICA'S
 NUMBER ONE ENEMY.
 YOU ARE THE LAST PERSON TO
 LECTURE ANYONE ON PATRIOTISM.
 # JOE CHINA.
 BUT IT WASN'T JUST HIM.
 IT WAS ALL OF THEM.
 HOW DARE YOU CELEBRATE AMERICA
 TRIED THE LEFT, IT'S NOT WHO
 WE ARE.
 IT'S JUST NOT WHO WE ARE AS
 AMERICANS BUT WE DON'T PUMP
 OUR CHEST WITH TANKS IN THE
 STREET, FLY JETS OVER TO PROVE
 OUR STRENGTH.
 I THINK REDUCING OUR NATION
 TO TANKS AND SHOWS OF MUSCLE
 JUST MAKES US LOOK LIKE THE
 KIND OF LOUDMOUTH GUY AT THE
 BAR.
 ADVOCATES A WASTE OF
 MONEY.
 HE'S HAVING A PARADE OUT THERE
 FOR HIMSELF, PUTTING TANKS OUT
 THERE FOR HIMSELF AND IF HE
 WAS SERVING OUR NATION HE'D BE
 INVESTING IN HIGHER PAY,
 BETTER HOUSING A BETTER
 HEALTHCARE.
 THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT
 PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS DONE
 UNLIKE PRESIDENT OBAMA.
 THE BIG POINT IS CAPTURED IN
 THAT SMUG PLATITUDE PLOTTED
 OUT BY THE RIDICULOUS ERIC'S
 WALL WELL.
 IT'S NOT WHO WE ARE.
 FOR ONCE, THAT PHRASE TOLD US
 SOMETHING USEFUL ABOUT THE
 DEMOCRATS, JUST NOT THE WAY
 THEY INTENDED.
 THE PROUD AMERICANS WHO STOOD
 IN THE POURING RAIN AND FROM
 THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL TO
 CELEBRATE THEIR COUNTRY,
 THAT'S NOT WHO THE DEMOCRATS
 ARE.
 THE MILLIONS MORE WHO WATCHED
 AT HOME AND THOUGHT FINALLY WE
 HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO LOVES
 AMERICA AS MUCH AS WE DO IN
 ISN'T EMBARRASSED TO SAY SO,
 NO, THAT IS NOT WHO THE
 DEMOCRATS ARE.
 THE DEMOCRATS WON'T CELEBRATE
 AMERICA BECAUSE THEIR NEW
 IDEOLOGY DEMANDS THAT THEY
 DENIGRATE AMERICA, NOT LEAST
 WITH THEIR RECKLESS DIVISIVE
 LIES ABOUT CONCENTRATION CAMPS
 AT THE BORDER, COLLUSION WITH
 RUSSIA.
 TODAY'S DEMOCRATS ARE ENGAGED
 IN A CONCERTED EFFORT TO SMEAR
 THIS COUNTRY AT HOME AND IN
 THE EYES OF THE WORLD.
 WHEN THEY TELL YOU THEY DON'T
 WANT TO CELEBRATE AMERICA
 BECAUSE IT'S NOT WHO WE ARE,
 BELIEVE THEM.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP BY CONTRAST
 LAID OUT EXACTLY WHY WE SHOULD
 CELEBRATE.
 THE AMERICAN SPIRIT, HE TALKED
 ABOUT ON INDEPENDENCE DAY HAD
 DRIVEN SOME THE MOST PROFOUND
 ACHIEVEMENTS IN HISTORY FOR
 MEDICAL BREAKTHROUGHS TO
 TECHNOLOGICAL MARVELS.
 IT HAS CONTINUALLY CONFOUNDED
 WHAT THE WORLD THANKS IS
 POSSIBLE, BUT WHY, HOW, IT'S
 NOT JUST CHANCE OR LUCK, THERE
 ARE OTHER COUNTRIES JUST AS
 TALENTED AND INGENIOUS.
 HERE'S MIGHT SUSPECT AS A
 RECENT ARRIVAL.
 IT'S AMERICA'S GREATEST
 ACHIEVEMENT THAT HAS MADE ALL
 THE OTHERS POSSIBLE, AND THAT
 IS THE GENIUS FRAMEWORK
 CONSTRUCTED BY THE FOUNDERS
 AND EXPRESSED IN THE FOUNDING
 DOCUMENTS ALL IN-SERVICE WITH
 THAT SIMPLE IDEA, IS LIBERTY
 UNDER THE LAW.
 IF THE GUARANTEE OF INDIVIDUAL
 LIBERTY THAT GAVE THE PIONEERS
 THE CONFIDENCE TO SET OUT INTO
 THE UNKNOWN AND THE BELIEF
 THEY COULD BUILD SOMETHING
 BETTER.
 THEY COULD GOVERN THEMSELVES.
 POWER TO THE PEOPLE.
 DECENTRALIZED AND LIMITED
 GOVERNMENT.
 THE RULE OF LAW.
 THESE ARE THE FOUNDATION OF
 THE AMERICAN SPIRIT THEY HAVE
 PAVED THE WAY BUT ALSO OUR
 ECONOMIC SYSTEM WHICH
 INVESTMENT INNOVATION AND
 SUCCESS IS REWARDED, NOT
 PUNISHED.
 LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE IT
 MAKES.
 ANOTHER INCREDIBLE JOBS REPORT
 LAST WEEK.
 INCOMES RISING FASTEST, RECORD
 LOW UNEMPLOYMENT AND A FAIR
 ECONOMY.
 FOR EXAMPLE THE GAP BETWEEN
 WHITE AND AFRICAN-AMERICAN
 UNEMPLOYMENT HAVE SHRUNK BY
 NEARLY A HALF SINCE 2016.
 THE OBAMA YEARS GAVE US LOW
 GROWTH AND HIGHER INEQUALITY.
 WITH OBAMA WE HAD THE EXACT
 OPPOSITE LOWER IN A
 INEQUALITY.
 THEY BEEN CAPTURED BY AN
 EXTREMIST IDEOLOGY THAT IS
 FUNDAMENTALLY ANTI-AMERICAN.
 YOU SOUGHT AT THE DEBATE.
 IT CONNECTS EVERYTHING.
 AND YES THEIR HYSTERICAL
 REACTION TO PRESIDENT TRUMP
 SALUTE TO AMERICA.
 THEY'RE NOT CELEBRATING
 AMERICA BUT DENIGRATING
 AMERICA.
 NOT POWER TO THE PEOPLE BUT
 POWER FOR THEMSELVES ON THE
 BUREAUCRATIC ELITE.
 NOT DECENTRALIZED GOVERNMENT
 BUT EVERYTHING CONTROLLED FROM
 WASHINGTON D.C.
 THE DEMOCRATS DON'T WANT
 LIMITED GOVERNMENT.
 THEY WANT ENDLESS, RELENTLESS
 INTERVENTION BY AN
 ALL-KNOWING, ALL SEEING
 ALL-POWERFUL STATE.
 HERE'S PERHAPS THE BIGGEST
 CHANGE FROM THE DEMOCRATS OF
 THE PAST.
 TODAY'S DEMOCRATS DON'T EVEN
 WANT THE MOST VITAL ELEMENTS
 OF THE AMERICAN INHERITANCE,
 THE RULE OF LAW.
 AT THAT FIRST PRESIDENTIAL
 DEBAOST ALL OF THE 2020
 CANDIDATES BACK TO THE
 DECRIMINALIZATION OF ILLEGAL
 IMMIGRATION.
 ON WEDNESDAY, CORY BOOKER
 ASKED ESCORTED MIGRANTS TOWARD
 THE BORDER HIMSELF, EVEN
 PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FORMER
 HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY
 NOW SAYS THE DEMOCRATS ARE
 EFFECTIVELY FOR OPEN BORDERS.
 THE DEMOCRATS POINT TO THE
 STATUE OF LIBERTY AND SAY
 IMMIGRATION CONTROL IS
 UN-AMERICAN.
 THEY FORGET ONE VITAL THING,
 IT'S NOT JUST LIBERTY, IT'S
 LIBERTY UNDER THE LAW AND IT
 IS THERE LATENT ASSAULT ON THE
 RULE OF LAW THAT IS TRULY
 UN-AMERICAN.
 LET ME END ON A PERSONAL NOTE
 ABOUT AMERICA.
 I'M AN IMMIGRANT JUST AS MY
 PARENTS WERE IN ENGLAND AFTER
 THEY FLED COMMUNISM IN
 HUNGARY.
 I'VE ALWAYS BEEN PRO-
 IMMIGRATION.
 HOW CAN I BE ANYTHING ELSE BUT
 IT'S ESPECIALLY THOSE OF US
 WHO BELIEVED IN THE VIRTUES
 AND BENEFITS OF IMMIGRATION
 WHO SHOULD WANT TO SEE IT
 PROPERLY CONTROLLED.
 PUBLIC CONSENT DEPENDS ON
 GOVERNMENT CONTROL OF
 IMMIGRATION.
 THAT'S WHY IMMIGRATION HAS TO
 BE DONE THE RIGHT WAY
 ACCORDING TO THE RULES.
 THAT CERTAINLY HOW I'VE DONE
 IT SINCE I MOVED HERE WITH MY
 FAMILY AND I THOUGHT THIS JULY
 THE FOURTH WEEKEND WAS A GOOD
 MOMENT LET YOU KNOW THAT I'M
 NOW BEGUN THE PROCESS OF
 APPLYING FOR U.S.
 CITIZENSHIP.
 I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH I
 APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY
 THIS COUNTRY HAS GIVEN ME AND
 THE WELCOME YOU ALL SHOWN ME
 AND NOW I'M LOOKING FORWARD
 ONE DAY TO CELEBRATING
 INDEPENDENCE DAY AS AN
 AMERICAN, IF YOU'LL HAVE ME
 THAT IS.
 LET ME KNOW.
 AT STEVE HILTON X AND NEXT REV
 FMC.
 SENIOR ADVISOR KATRINA PEARSON
 IS HERE AND FOX NEWS
 CONTRIBUTOR AND AUTHOR OF THE
 NEW BOOK POWER GRAB JASON
 SHAPE US.
 LOTS OF TOPICS IN THERE,
 IMMIGRATION, THE DEMOCRATS
 GOING NUTS, WHERE DO YOU WANT
 TO START.
 I THINK I'LL START BY
 SAYING OF COURSE WE WELCOME
 YOU.
 I APPLAUD YOU.
 WE NEED MORE AMERICANS THAT
 FIGHT FOR THIS COUNTRY.
 I THINK YOU HAVE IT EXACTLY
 RIGHT.
 THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A FLAG
 DURING THE DEBATE ON STAGE.
 THEIR ANTIAMERICAN ARE
 DEPLORABLE AND THE OTHERS ARE
 JUST AS EXPENDABLE BECAUSE
 THEIR MAIN FOCUS AND PRIORITY
 ARE ON THE FAMILY AND CHILDREN
 OF ILLEGAL ALIENS IN FOREIGN
 NATIONALS ON THE WAY.
 I THINK YOUR ABSOLUTE RIGHT,
 MOST AMERICANS SEE THAT.
 THERE WERE DEMOCRATS AT THAT
 EVENT IN WASHINGTON D.C. WHO
 WATCHED THIS PRESIDENT AND WHO
 WERE EXCITED TO BE THERE
 BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME
 DEMOCRATS LEFT IN THIS COUNTRY
 WHO LOVE IT AND WHO SUPPORTED
 BECAUSE IT IS THE UNITED
 STATES OF AMERICA, IT'S THE
 BEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD AND
 IT'S EXACTLY WHY EVERYONE IS
 TRYING TO COME IN.
 WHEN YOU SHOW CLIPS THAT
 YOU SHOWED WHAT THESE
 DEMOCRATS WERE SAYING, FRANKLY
 IN MY OPINION, ANY
 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE THAT IS
 CRITICIZING SALUTING AMERICA
 ON INDEPENDENCE DAY SHOULD BE
 DISQUALIFIED.
 WELL SAID.
 JASON, THE DEMOCRATS WOULD SAY
 IT'S OUTRAGEOUS, WERE NOT
 ANTI-AMERICAN WE JUST HAVE A
 DIFFERENT SET OF IDEAS.
 WE LOOK AT THE WAY THEY ARE
 RUNNING AROUND, DELIBERATELY
 DISTORTING AND MAKING STUFF UP
 TO MAKE AMERICA LOOK BAD, WHEN
 YOU LOOK AT THE SHIFT TO THE
 LEFT, IT CONTRADICTS SOMETHING
 VERY IMPORTANT ABOUT THE
 SPIRIT AND SOUL OF THIS
 COUNTRY.
 THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES IN
 AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM.
 I BELIEVE IN THAT AND YET
 DEMOCRATS ARE EMBARRASSED
 ABOUT THE COUNTRY, THERE
 EMBARRASSED OF THE FLAG, THERE
 EMBARRASSED THIS PRESIDENT HAS
 WRAPPED HIMSELF IN THE FLAG.
 I THINK THAT'S WHY THE
 OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF
 AMERICANS LOVE THIS PRESIDENT
 BECAUSE IT'S THE ONE THING
 THAT SUPPOSED TO DRAW
 TOGETHER, A FLAG OF THE UNITED
 STATES OF AMERICA.
 IT SHOULDN'T BE A PARTISAN
 ISSUE BUT THERE CHOOSING TO
 MAKE IT A PARTISAN ISSUE.
 I THINK THEY DO SO WITH THEIR
 OWN POLITICAL PERIL.
 I LIKE THE SUM OF WHAT YOU'RE
 SAYING.
 THE RULE OF LAW DOES GIVE US
 THE LIBERTY AND WE DO BELIEVE
 IN LIMITED GOVERNMENT AND
 THERE IS A FUNDAMENTAL
 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT THE
 DEMOCRATS BELIEVE IN WHICH IS
 MORE EAGER GOVERNMENT AND WHAT
 PRESIDENT TRUMP IS FIGHTING
 FOR TO INCREASE OUR LIBERTY BY
 GIVING MORE CHANCES, MORE
 OPPORTUNITY.
 YOU COULD SAY THAT DEBATE
 WHICH IS A FRAMEWORK WHICH IS
 DIFFERENT THAN ANYWHERE IN THE
 WORLD.
 ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD
 THAT WOULD BE A REALLY WEIRD
 THING TO SAY.
 [INAUDIBLE]
 IT'S JUST FUNDAMENTALLY
 ANTI-AMERICAN.
 IT IS.
 THE PEOPLE WON'T ALLOW IT.
 IT'S NOT ABOUT BIG
 GOVERNMENT.
 IT'S ABOUT POWER AND THEY
 WON'T SAY THAT.
 IN ORDER TO HAVE ALL THE POWER
 THEY HAVE TO HAVE THE
 GOVERNMENT AS BIG AS POSSIBLE
 SO THEY CAN CONTROL EVERYONE.
 THEY WILL EXEMPT THEMSELVES
 JUST LIKE THEY ALWAYS HAVE IN
 THE PAST BUT IT IS ABOUT
 POWER.
 THIS ERRATIC DERANGEMENT THAT
 WE SEE AMONG THE DEMOCRATS AND
 IN THE MEDIA, ALTHOUGH I
 REPEAT MYSELF WAS REALLY
 COMING FROM THIS TRAUMA OF
 THIS ELECTION AND THEY GRASP
 ONTO THIS AND YOU SEE THIS
 CONSTANTLY ATTACKING INNOCENT
 PEOPLE AS DEPLORABLE AND
 ATTACKING IN ADAMANT OBJECTS
 BECAUSE NOW THEY'RE UNHINGED.
 YOU SAW THIS DEBATE.
 WE HAVE THIS PLETHORA OF
 CANDIDATES WHO WERE SAYING
 OUTRAGEOUS THINGS WITH READ
 DICK ILLICITLY STUPID POLICY
 AND WHAT WE HAVE TODAY,
 PRESIDENT TRUMP'S APPROVAL IS
 NOW THE HIGHEST IT'S EVER BEEN
 AND THAT GIVES YOU A CLUE ON
 WHERE AMERICANS STAND ON THESE
 ISSUES TODAY.
 WERE GOING TO LOOK, I'M
 SORRY WERE OUT OF TIME FORWARD
 AND A LOOK AT THE POLICY SHIFT
 A LITTLE BIT LATER IN THE
 SHOW.
 IT WAS SO DEEPLY REVEALING OF
 WHERE THEY ARE.
 EVEN THOUGH THEY SAY WE MUST
 UNDERSTAND WE CAN'T MAKE THAT
 MISTAKE AGAIN YOU KNOW THE WAY
 THEY TALK THEY REALLY LOOK
 DOWN THEIR NOSE FROM A
 CULTURAL PERSPECTIVE EVEN THE
 FOOD THEY EAT.
 THAT'S WHY THEY CAN'T STAND
 TRUMP BECAUSE HE CONNECTS W
 THAT AND RS THAT
 GIVES VOICE TO THAT.BEFORE WE TS
 SOCCER TEAM WNG<I THE WORLD
 CUP EARLIER TODAY.
 WHAT A GREAT WAY TO CLOSE OUT
 THE WEEKEND.
 MANY CONGRATULATIONS FOR
 FANTASTIC AND INSPIRING
 ACHIEVEMENT.
 AFTER THE BREAK, THE PEOPLE
 VERSUS CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN
 ROBERTS.

 THIS WEEK THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED IT
 INTENDS TO PUT A CONSENSUS
 QUESTION ON THE ELECTION.
 WHATEVER THE ARGUMENT ABOUT
 THE CENSUS QUESTION THERE WAS
 AN ASPECT OF THE RULING AND
 ESPECIALLY THE MAJORITY
 ACHIEVE OPINION FROM THE CHIEF
 JUSTICE THAT WILL HAVE
 LONG-LASTING AND DISASTROUS
 CONSEQUENCES FOR THE COUNTRY
 WAY BEYOND THE CENSUS.■■■1T IT'S
 CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS.
 THE ARGUMENT USED BY THE CHIEF
 JUSTICE TO BLOCK THE
 CITIZENSHIP QUESTION WAS THAT
 THE RATIONALE FOR THE CHANGE
 GIVEN BY WILBUR ROSS WAS THAT
 HE WAS RESPONDING TO A REQUEST
 FROM THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
 AND WASN'T WRITTEN THE REAL
 REASON.
 HE WAS PLANNING TO PUT THIS
 CITIZEN QUESTION ON THE CENSUS
 BEFORE IT CAME IN.
 SO WHAT.
 UNDER THE CONSTITUTION IT'S AN
 EXECUTIVE BRANCH DECISION THAT
 HAS LONG BEEN A LEGAL
 PRECEDENT THAT THE COURT CAN'T
 OBJECT TO ACTION JUST BECAUSE
 THERE ARE OTHER REASONS FOR
 THE DECISION THAN THOSE
 STATED.
 JOHN ROBERTS HAS JUST
 OVERTURNED THAT PRESIDENT AND
 THIS WILL HAVE MASSIVE AND
 DEEPLY DAMAGING IMPLICATIONS
 FOR THE WAY THINGS WORK OR
 RATHER DON'T WORK IN AMERICA.
 IN THE DEFENSE OF THE CASE
 WRITTEN BY JUSTICE CLARENCE
 THOMAS AND JOINED BY GORSUCH
 AND KAVANAUGH, HE WROTE THE
 COURT HAS OPENED A PANDORA'S
 BOX AND CHALLENGES IN
 ADMINISTRATIVE LAW.
 WHAT DOES ALL THIS MEAN IN
 PLAIN ENGLISH AND WHAT DOES IT
 MEAN FOR YOU.
 [INAUDIBLE] IS HAD NO ON T ACA, ASYLUM,
 EVEN BLOCKING IMMIGRATION.
 THE COURT SAID NO TO POLICIES
 YOU VOTED FOR.
 ALL IN ALL, UNELECTED JUDGES
 HAVE RULED AGAINST THE TRUMP
 ADMINISTRATION MORE THAN 70
 TIMES, WAY MORE THAN THE RATES.
 THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU
 VOTE FOR THIS TYPE OF
 PRESIDENT.
 NOW THIS RULING WILL MAKE IT
 TEN TIMES WORSE.
 ANY PART OF THAT GROUP WILL BE
 ABLE TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION
 AGAINST THE ADMINISTRATION AND
 HELPING AS JUSTICE THOMAS SAID
 THROUGH DEPOSITION, DELAY AND
 DISTRACTION.
 GREAT.
 THAT'S JUST WHAT WE NEED AND
 EVEN MORE POLITICIZED
 JUDICIARY.
 EVEN MORE ROADBLOCKS IN THE
 WAY OF ACTUALLY GETTING THINGS
 DONE THAT HELP YOUR LIFE.
 THE WORST OF IT ALL IS JOHN
 ROBERTS OWN MOTIVE.
 FOR THE HIM IT IS ALL ABOUT
 THE IMAGE OF THE COURT.
 NOW THAT HE'S THE SWING VOTE.
 HE DOESN'T WANT TO MAKE HIS
 COURT LOOK PARTISAN.
 THE OTHER WEEK HE BALANCED HIS
 RULING ON GERRYMANDERING WITH
 THIS DAMAGING ON THE REVIEW OF
 EXECUTIVE DECISIONS.
 HE SUPPOSED TO BE THE CHIEF
 JUSTICE, NOT THE CHEAP PR.
