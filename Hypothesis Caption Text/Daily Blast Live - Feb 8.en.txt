 FO
 THIS IS "DAILY BLAST LIVE". WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT YEAR
 TALKING ABOUT.
 BECAUSE EVERYONE IS TALKING
 ABOUT THIS.
 ALWAYS LIVE, ALWAYS REAL,
 ALWAYS UNPREDICTABLE.
 YOU'RE TOTALLY OFF BASE
 HERE.
 LOG ON AND JOIN OUR LIVE
 CONVERSATION.
 I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING
 THIS.
 I DO AGREE WITH YOU.
 DBL STARTS RIGHT NOW.

 WELCOME TO DBL.
 IT IS FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 8th,

 YES, WE ARE LIVE AND WE'RE
 TALKING ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE
 TALKING ABOUT.
 I'M HERE WITH TORY, JEFF, AL
 AND I'M SAM.
 LET'S GET STARTED.
 THE RICHEST MAN IN THE WORD
 SAYS HE IS BEING EXTORTED AND
 EXTORTED AND BLACKMAILED.
 JEFF SAYS THE COMPANY IS TRYING
 TO EXTORT HIM WITH EXPLICIT
 PHOTOS.
 THIS ALL STEMMED FROM THE
 NATIONAL ENQUIRER STORY ABOUT
 HIS AFFAIR WHICH INCLUDED
 PRIVATE TEXTS BETWEEN THE TWO.
 HE HIRED AN INVESTIGATORS TO
 FIND OUT HOW THEY GOT THOSE
 TEXTS BUT NOW HE CLAIMS A.M.
 I THROUGH A LAWYER TRIED  TO
 GET HIM TO HOLD OFF ON HIS
 INVESTIGATION OR ELSE THEY
 WOULD PUBLISH THE PHOTOS WHICH
 INCLUDES A QUOTE BELOW THE
 BELT.
 THERE IS A POTENTIAL POLITICAL
 ANGLE TO THE STORY AS HE OWNS
 THE WASHINGTON POST WHICH HAS
 BEEN VERY CRITICAL OF THE
 PRESIDENT.
 MEANWHILE AMI HAS A PLEA
 AGREEMENT OVER THE HUSH MONEY
 PAYMENTS DURING THE 2016
 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN THAT MAY
 HAVE BENEFITED DONALD TRUMP.
 THEY SAID IT ACTED LAWFULLY AND
 WILL INVESTIGATE THE CLAIMS.
 TORY, YOU'RE OUR LEGAL EAGLE.
 ANYTHING READING THOSE E-MAILS
 SAY IT IS BLACKMAIL EXTORTION
 ONE OR ONE.
 THE FIRST THING YOU HAVE
 HAVE TO KNOW THEY WILL TRY TO
 GET OUT OF IT.
 IT IS BLACKMAIL.
 YOU SHOULD NEVER WRITE THIS
 DOWN IN E-MAIL BECAUSE IT IS
 HORRIBLE, BUT HAVING THAT E-
 MAIL IS PROOF OF EVERYTHING.
 I THINK JEFF BEZOS HAS NOTHING
 TO LOSE HERE.
 HIS REPUTATION MAY HAVE GONE
 DONE, BUT I SEE PEOPLE ARE
 APPLAUDING HIM AND SAYING, HIS
 FAMOUS QUOTE IS I THINK I'LL
 ROLL THE LOG OVER AND SEE WHAT
 CRAWLS OUT.
 THIS IS WORRY SOME BECAUSE
 NOT EVERYONE HAS THE RESOURCES
 THAT HE HAS AND IF YOU DO, WHAT
 IF MY CHILDREN SEE THIS?
 WHAT IF MY BOARD OF DIRECTORS
 ARS UPSET BAY THIS.
 YOU SEE A COMPANY THAT IS ABOVE
 THE LAW.
 WITH THAT TYPE OF POWER WHAT
 HAVE THEY DONE BEFORE THAT WE
 DON'T KNOW ABOUT?
 WE HAVE THE CATCH AND KILL
 STORY THAT WE TALKED ABOUT IN
 PREVIOUS SHOWS.
 AT THIS POINT, I DON'T
 UNDERSTAND WHY EXTORTION AND
 BLACKMAIL ARE NOT TREATED LIKE
 THE CRIMES THEY ARE.
 THIS IS ILLEGAL.
 A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE
 RESOURCES THAT ARE BLACKMAILED
 FOR YEARS.
 MARIAH CAREY.
 SHE IS A PERSON OVEN NOR MUS
 MEANS.
 WE KEEP SLAPPING PEOPLE ON THE
 WRISTS AND YOU GET SIX MONTHS
 OF PROBATION.
 UNTIL THEY ARE TREATED LIKE
 THEY ARE TRUE CRIMES THEY ARE
 OR CORRUPTION, I DON'T THINK
 WE'LL SEE A CHANGE IN THIS
 BEHAVIOR.
 ANOTHER SMEAR CAMPAIGN THE
 ENQUIRER DID.
 CHECK THIS OUT.

 [ LAUGHTER ]
 THEY PUT THAT SHE HATES MY
 GRAY HAIR.
 SHE NEVER REPORTED THAT.
 THAT IS YOUR SIGNATURE.
 LOOK.
 WHAT IS UP WITH THAT?
 I KNOW.
 NOW I'M REALLY DONE WITH THE
 INQUIRER.
 HOW DID THEY GET YOU?
 DID TAY LIFT YOUR LEG, GRAB IT
 UNDER THE KNEE?
 FOR THE AMAZING RACE YOU
 HAVE TO DO WEIRD POSES, SO...
 ARE YOU A GOOD GO TO?
 WHAT DID YOU THINKER, I'M A
 DIRECTOR?
 ARE YOU JEALOUS I'M IN THE
 ENQUIRER?
 TORY.
 FOR SURE.

 [ LAUGHTER ]
 THE PRESIDENT'S DAUGHTER IS
 SLAMMING AN ART EXHIBIT RIGHT
 NOW AS SEXIST.
 THIS IS THE ART EXHIBIT IN D.C.
 IT INVITES PEOPLE TO THROW
 CRUMBS AT A LOOKALIKE MODEL OF
 IVANKA AND THEN VACUUMS THE
 YUMS UP.
 SHE WAS ASKED ON G.M.
 A. HERE IS HER RESPONSE.
 I THINK IT IS A VERY SEXIST
 REPRESENTATION OF A WOMAN BUT
 WHAT BOTHERED ME ABOUT THIS
 IMAGE IS THAT THEY HIRED A 16-
 YEAR-OLD GIRL TO STAND THERE
 AND HAVE CRUMBS THROWN AT HER
 FOR TWO HOURS A DAY FOR A
 COUPLE OF MONTHS.
 SO I HAVE A REAL PROBLEM
 WITH THAT.
 AND TORY, NOT ONLY ARE YOU
 OUR LEGAL EAGLE BUT YOU'RE AN
 ART HISTORY MAJOR.
 SHOULD IVANKA HAVE A PROBLEM
 WITH THIS?
 NO.
 I THINK SHE IS TAKING IT WRONG
 AS THE VACUUM IS SEX EXIST.
 THEY ARE NOT THROWING CRUMBS AT
 HER OR THE LOOKALIKE.
 THE WHOLE IDEA WHO IS THE
 ARTIST IS IT IS MAKING FUN OF
 US, THE VIEWERS WHO ARE
 THROWING THE BREADCRUMBS SO SHE
 HAS TO CLEAN UP THE MESS AND IT
 SHOWS HOW MUCH WE ENJOY THE
 MESS, AND TO WATCH IT BE
 CLEANED UP.
 HER CLEANING UP HER FATHER OR
 THE ADMINISTRATION.
 YES AND WE KEEP THROWING
 STUFF AT HER TO SEE WHAT SHE
 WILL CLEAN UP.
 IT IS A VERY BIG
 INTERPRETATION.
 I THINK SHE USED TOO MUCH OF A
 LITERAL INTERPRETATION.
 IT IS PROF VACATION.
 BUT SOME PEOPLE WITH ART,
 YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO THE
 INTERPRETATION.
 YOU HAD A DIFFERENT
 INTERPRETATION.
 YES.
 I'M SURPRISED BY YOUR REACTION
 IN THIS ME TOO MOVE: THIS IS
 KIND OF SEXIST.
 I DON'T THINK A WOMAN WITH A
 VACUUM IS IN ANY WAY
 ENLIGHTENING.
 I GET THE ART FORM BUT I DON'T
 THINK IT IS COOL.
 WHAT ARE WORDS YOU THINK OF?
 '60s.
 ANTIQUE QUITED.
 EXACTLY.
 SO THAT IS THE POINT.
 YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SEE HER AS
 THIS ROLE MODEL, 1950s "LEAVE
 IT TO BEAVER" ON THE OUTSIDE,
 BUT ON THE INSIDE SHE IS
 CLEANING UP EVERY BODY'S MESS
 AND THERE IS THAT "LEAVE IT TO
 BEAVER."
 BUT BECAUSE IT IS TRUMP,
 THEY INTERPRET IT AS ART BUT IF
 IT WAS THE OBAMAS IT WOULDN'T
 BE INTERPRETED THAT WAY.
 IF IT WAS MICHELLE OR
 SOMETHING I DON'T THINK THEY
 WOULD HAVE BEEN ANGRY BUT
 HOPEFULLY INTERPRETED IT AS AN
 ART PIECE.
 WE INTERPRET IT DIFFERENT.
 WE HAVE SAD NEWS TO SHARE.
 ACTOR ALBERT FINNEY PASSED AWAY
 AT 82.
 HE RECEIVED FIVE OSCAR
 NOMINATIONS FOR HIS ROLES IN
 TOM JONES, MURDER ON THE ORIENT
 EXPRESS AND ERIN BROCKOVICH AND
 HE WAS IN ANNIE.
 I LOVED HIM IN BIG FISH.
 HIS FAMILY SAID HE PASSED AWAY
 PEACEFULLY AFTER A SHORT
 ILLNESS WITH THOSE CLOSEST TO
 HIM BAY HIS SIDE.
 WE'RE ALSO REMEMBERING FRANK
 ROBINSON, HE WAS THE FIRST
 AFRICAN-AMERICAN MANAGER IN
 MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL.
 HE PASSED AWAY.
 HE WON MVP IN BOTH LEAGUES.
 I ALWAYS LOOK AT YOU,
 BECAUSE YOU FOCUS ON THEIR
 LEGACY.
 WE NOT THAT IS WAITING FOR
 ALL OF US.
 THE ONLY THING WE CAN CONTROL
 IS WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW.
 HOW YOU HANDLE TODAY.
 YOU LOOK AT THE LIVES THAT
 FRANK ROBINSON HAD AND, I MEAN,
 WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT?
 BUT PASS AWAY AT HOME WITH YOUR
 GRANDKIDS AROUND THE BED.
 THAT IS COOL.
 THAT IS THE GOAL.
 IT IS NOT COOL WHEN YOU'RE 20
 AND YOU'RE OUT AT THE NIGHTCLUB
 AND SOMETHING HAPPENS.
 WHEN YOU ARE AT HOME AND GET TO
 DIE WITH THE PEOPLE WHO LOVE
 YOU, I'M ALL FOR THAT.
 AMEN.
 WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.

 WELCOME BACK TO DBL. THEY ARE CRACKING DOWN OF THE
 POSTING AND SHARES CHECKPOINTS
 THEY SENT A CEASE AND
 DESIST LETTER TO GOOGLE TO STOP
 SHARING THIS.
 THE DEPARTMENT SAYS POSTING THE
 LOCATIONS OF DWI CHECKPOINTS IS
 LIKELY GROUNDS FOR ENGAGING IN
 CRIMINAL CONDUCT BECAUSE IT
 COULD BE USED TO AID IMPAIRED
 AND INTOXICATED DRIVERS AND
 BYPASSING CHECKPOINTS AND
 ENCOURAGES THAT DRIVING.
 CHASTITY FROM FACEBOOK SAYS
 THE APP DOESN'T NECESSARILY
 SHOW COLLECT POINTS.
 IT IS ALLOWS PEOPLE TO TIP-OFF
 OTHER DRIVERS WHERE THE POLICE
 ARE LOCATED.
 THEY ARE MAKING IT SOUND LIKE
 THEY ARE EXPOSING CHECKPOINTS.
 IT TRULY HELPS ME SLOW DOWN
 WHEN I'M DRIVING.
 LOOK AT YOU WITH THE
 CONSPIRACY THEORY.
 THAT SOUNDS RIGHT FOR DUIs ARE
 A BIG SOURCE OF REVENUE FOR
 POLICE AN WELL AS SPEEDING
 TICKETS.
 WHEN THEY SAY A COP IS 100 FEET
 AHEAD, THEY DON'T LIKE THAT.
 YOU WANT TO GO HIGHER WITH
 YOUR VOICE?
 I WAS HURT.

 [ LAUGHTER ]
 SHOCKED.
 I AM SO SORRY.
 KAREN SAID IT HAS TO DO WITH
 THE GOTCHA MENTALITY OF THE
 COPS.
 SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING
 FOR ME IS YOU AREN'T ALLOWED TO
 STOP A CAR UNLESS YOU HAVE
 PROBABLE CAUSE BECAUSE YOU HAVE
 RIGHTS TO PRIVACY WHICH I'M BIG
 ON.
 SO IF YOU HAVE A D.U.I.
 CHECKPOINT WHERE THEY CHECK
 EVERY CAR, THEY HAVE TO
 ANNOUNCE IT SO EVERY STATE YOU
 HAVE TO HEAR FROM THE POLICE IF
 YOU HAVE A SCANNER.
 ALL THEY ARE DOING IS PUTTING
 IT IN THERE.
 I WANT MY PRIVACY KEPT CLEAN.
 BUT WHAT ABOUT IF YOUR
 PRIVACY IS INFRINGING ON THE
 SAFETY OF MY LOVED ONES?
 I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT.
 WHEN IT COMES TO DRINKING AND
 DRIVING I HAVE ZERO TOLERANCE
 AND FOR DECADES WE HAVE HAD
 THESE CHECKPOINTS AND THEY HAVE
 LEGITIMATELY TAKEN PEOPLE OFF
 THE ROAD THAT COULD HAVE KILLED
 ONE OF MY LOVED ONES, SO I
 AGREE.
 I DON'T THINK WA ZE SHOULD BE A
 RED FLAG WHERE THE CHECKPOINTS
 ARE.
 I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THEY
 ARE LOOKING OUT FOR OUR SAFETY.
 I THINK IT IS A MINI PLAY.
 BUT THE END RESULT IS TAKING
 THEM OFF THE ROAD.
 IF YOU'RE DRIVING DRUNK,
 YOU'RE AN IDIOT.
 UBERS ARE $5.
 BUT SOME PEOPLE LIVE
 PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK.
 WHAT ARE YOU DRINKING FOR
 THEN.
 JUST TAKE AN UBER.
 COMING UP, WE HAVE THE MUST
 HAVE GIFTS THAT WILL WOW YOUR
 SWEETHEART THIS V DAY.
 NEXT WE'RE CHATTING WITH THE
 STARS OF THE LATEST PROJECT.
 WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK WITH
 THAT.
 HI.
 I'M MATT McCOY.

 YOU AND ME, CAREFUL DRIVING

 WELCOME BACK TO DBL.
 CRITICS ARE CALLING JAMES
 CAMERON'S NEWEST MOVIE
 MESMERIZING AND ASTONISHING.
 IT IS THE LATEST ATTEMPT AT
 PUSHING HIGH-TECH BOUNDARIES
 AFTER HIS 2009 SHOW AVATAR.
 THIS BODY, I FEEL A
 CONNECTION TO IT.
 I CAN'T EXPLAIN.
 HELLO, EVERYONE.
 HELLO.
 HOW ARE YOU?
 I SAW YOU IN ACTION AND I
 CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW HARD IT
 MUST HAVE BEEN TO KISS SOMEONE
 THROUGH A KIND OF MOTION SUIT.
 HOW IS THAT?
 SEXY.
 WAS THERE ANY TONGUE ACTION
 OR LIKE A CLAW IN A MASK?
 NO, NO.
 MY FACE IS RIGHT THERE.
 FOR BETTER OR WORSE, THAT IS ME
 UP THERE.
 WHAT IS IT LIKE DIRECTING
 SOMEONE WHO IS THERE THAT YOU
 CAN'T SEE THE FINAL THING IN
 THAT MOMENT?
 TOUCH HIM AGAIN AND I WILL
 KILL YOU.
 IT WAS KIND OF DAUNTING.
 I WAS WONDERING WHAT IS MY
 ACTRESS GOING TO EVEN LOOK LIKE
 BECAUSE I'M SO USED TO ROSA
 BEING THERE.
 IT WAS LIKE WHAT IF I DON'T
 LIKE HER AS MUCH AND WHEN IT
 WAS DONE, IT WAS LIKE OH IT IS
 ROSA.
 IT IS STILL ROSA EVEN THOUGH
 THE PROPORTIONS ARE DIFFERENT,
 IT IS A DIFFERENT FACE.
 LAST NIGHT I SAW YOU KISS
 SOMEONE THAT WASN'T ACTUALLY
 THERE.
 THAT IS LIKE THE ULTIMATE
 CATFISH.
 HELLO FELLOW LONDONER.
 HELLO DARLING.
 WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE TO DO?
 I DON'T KNOW, BUT MAYBE WHEN
 TECHNOLOGY GETS THAT FAR I'LL
 BE LIKE ACTUALLY I WANT MY
 WHOLE BLOOMING BODY.
 THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
 CHATTING.
 WHAT WAS IT'S LIKE PLAYING
 SUCH A DIFFERENT CHARACTER AND
 WHAT DO YOU PREFER THE MEAN GUY
 OR THE LOVING FATHER FIGURE?
 WHY WOULD THAT BE A
 CONTRADICTION?
 MEAN GUYS CAN BE LOVING FATHERS
 AND LOVING FATHERS CAN BE MEAN.
 EVERYBODY HAS EVERYTHING.
 IT IS JUST THE PROPORTION THAT
 TO WHICH IT IS DISTRIBUTED IN
 1%NAL TY IS WHAT I'M CALLED
 UPON TO DISCOVER AS AN ACTOR.
 CAN I ASK YOU A BOUGHT BEING
 A DOCTOR IN THE NAVY?
 WHAT SIDE WOULD YOU WANT TO
 BETTER YOURSELF?
 THAT WOULD DEPEND WHAT I
 NEED.
 I'M WELL SERVED WITH WHAT I
 HAVE GOT.
 I LIKE BEING A HUMAN TRYING TO
 MAKE WHAT I HAVE WORK PROPERLY.
 BUT THIS TIME YOU'RE SO
 LOVING AND SO SWEET AND  --
 THAT IS WHO I REALLY AM.
 ARE YOU TELLING ME THE
 TRUTH?
 NO.
 WHAT YOU THINK YOU KNOW
 ABOUT ME FROM WATCHING OTHER
 MOVIES, COME ON.
 REALLY?

 WELCOME BACK TO DBL. TEN YEARS AGO ROBIN NICHOLS
 MADE SIMPLE CHANGES TO HER LIFE
 THAT LED TO AN INCREDIBLE
 TRANSFORMATION.
 SHE LOST MORE THAN 100 POUNDS
 AND KEPT IT OFF.
 BRANDON LONDON CAUGHT UP WITH
 HER.
 HI ROBIN.
 I'M BRANDON LONDON.
 NICE TO MEET YOU.
 THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR
 STORY WITH DBL NATION.
 YOU LOST 100 POUNDS TEN YEARS
 AGO.
 WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS
 THAT CAUSED YOU TO BECOME OVER
 WEIGHT?
 FROM AS EARLY AS I CAN
 REMEMBER LOOKING AT PICTURES OF
 MYSELF AS A BABY, I'M
 OVERWEIGHT AND THERE IS FOOD IN
 MY MOUTH AND THERE IS CHOCOLATE
 OR ICE-CREAM AND I'M ASLEEP AND
 COVERED IN STUFF.
 WHEN DID YOU HIT ROCK
 BUTTON?
 AFTER THE BIRTH OF OUR
 SECOND CHILD I WENT SHOPPING
 AND I COULDN'T FIT IN THE
 LARGER SIZE AND I REMEMBER
 BEING LIKE OH, MY GOD.
 I REMEMBER FORCING MYSELF TO
 TAKE OFF ALL MY CLOTHES AND
 LOOK AT MYSELF IN THE MIRROR
 AND GRAB AT MYSELF AND BE LIKE
 WHAT HAS BECOME OF YOU?
 WHO ARE SOME OF THE PEOPLE
 THAT HELPED YOU OUT AND
 MOTIVATED YOU ALONG THE WAY?
 MY DAD.
 MY DAD WAS DEFINITELY HUGE.
 MY SISTERS AND MY FAMILY HAVE
 ALWAYS BEEN AMAZING.
 I STARTED ROBIN'S NEST AS MUCH
 TO KEEP MYSELF HEALTHY AND TO
 HELP OTHERS SO I OFFER RETREATS
 FOR PEOPLE WHO WILL COME STAY
 WITH ME AND FOR 72 HOURS I COOK
 FOR THEM AND DON'T ALLOW THEM
 TO CHEAT AND GET THEM THROUGH
 THE DETOX PROCESS.
 HOW WERE YOU SO CONSISTENT
 WHEN IT CAME TO THE 12-STEP
 PROGRAM AND IT WASN'T A START
 AND STOP THING?
 I HIT ROCK BOTTOM.
 MY DAD WAS DYING.
 I HAD TO WATCH HIM DIE.
 I WOULD ALWAYS USE FOOD TO
 MITIGATE LIFE AND THERE IS
 NOTHING ON EARTH THAT COULD
 HAVE BEEN HARDER AND THAT IS
 WHEN I WALKED INTO THE DOORS OF
 THE 12 STEP PROGRAM AND WAS
 LIKE PLEASE HELP ME.
 HOW HAS YOUR LIFE CHANGED
 OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS?
 IN EVERY WAY.
 I'M SKIING, TRYING THINGS I
 NEVER WOULD HAVE.
 I HAVE SO MUCH GRATITUDE TOR
 LIFE.
 YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SHOW
 US TODAY.
 I DO.
 I DO.
 HERE IT IS.
 YOU WANT ME TO PUT IT ON?
 JUST PUT IT OUT REAL QUICK.
 I WANT TO SEE THE
 TRANSFORMATION FOR SURE.
 WOW!
 IT IS A PRETTY COLOR.
 THANK YOU.
 WOW!
 WHAT CURRENT ROBIN RIGHT NOW
 SAY TO THE ROBIN WHO WAS
 WEARING THIS SWEATER?
 IT REPRESENTS SO MUCH MORE
 THAN JUST WEIGHT.
 HIDING FROM LIFE AND IT IS
 AMAZING TO TAKE IT OFF.
 WELL, GO AHEAD AND TAKE OFF
 THAT CHAIN.
 HERE IS THE REBIRTH AND HERE
 YOU ARE NOW.
 I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.
 I'M THANKFUL FOR HEARING YOUR
 STORY.
 TO LIVE YOUR LIFE TO THE
 FULLEST CALL 1(800)393-6540.
 WHAT AN INCREDIBLE STORY.
 I THINK THAT WILL INSPIRE A LOT
 OF PEOPLE AND SEEING EVERYTHING
 THAT SHE HAS OVERCOME IN THE
 PAST ESPECIALLY WITH HER FATHER
 AND IT IS NICE TO SEE SHE IS
 TAKING AHOLD OF HER LIFE AND
 ENDING UP ON TON.
 GOOD FOR HER.
 AND BRANDON LONDON WORKS SO
 HARD FOR US AND HE IS GETTING
 GREAT AT THESE PIECES.
 SHE WAS SO COMFORTABLE
 TALKING ABOUT THAT.
 THE PASSING OF HER FATHER.
 YOU SEE THAT WEIGHT.
 WHEN PEOPLE SEE PEOPLE OVER
 WEIGHT, THEY SAY SHE IS LAZY,
 HE IS LAZY.
 THERE IS SO MUCH PAIN UNDER
 THAT WEIGHT AND GOOD ON HER AND
 GREAT JOB BRANDON LONDON.
 THAT WAS REALLY NICE.
 WE NEED TO CONTINUE THAT
 CONVERSATION IN THE BREAK.
