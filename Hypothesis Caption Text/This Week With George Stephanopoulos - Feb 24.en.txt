 Announcer: "THIS WEEK" WITH GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS STARTS
 RIGHT NOW.
 COUNTDOWN TO COHEN.
 MICHAEL COHEN'S TESTIMONY?
 NO, NO.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FORMER
 FIXER SET TO PULL BACK THE
 CURTAIN ON HIS TIME WITH TRUMP
 BEFORE THREE COMMITTEES IN
 CONGRESS.
 COHEN SAYS HE'LL TELL THE TRUTH
 ABOUT TRUMP AFTER YEARS OF LIES.
 HE'S COOPERATING AGAIN WITH
 PROSECUTORS IN NEW YORK.
 WILL THIS NEW TESTIMONY POSE A
 THREAT TO PRESIDENT TRUMP EVEN
 AFTER ROBERT MUELLER COMPLETES
 HIS INVESTIGATION?
 THAT AND MORE WITH HOUSE
 INTELLIGENCE CHAIR ADAM SCHIFF,
 OUR LEGAL EXPERTS DAN ABRAMS AND
 ALAN DERSHOWITZ AND ANDREW
 McCABE WHOSE NEW TELL ALL IS
 DRAWING FIRE FROM TRUMP.
 AND --
 THERE HAS BEEN NO NUCLEAR
 TESTING, NO MISSILES, NO
 ROCKETS.
 NO SIGNS YET THAT NORTH KOREA
 IS READY TO GIVE UP ITS NUCLEAR
 ARSENAL.
 WILL A SECOND MEETING WITH KIM
 JONG-UN BRING REAL PROGRESS?
 INSIDE ANALYSIS WITH OUR PANEL
 OF EXPERTS INCLUDING THE
 AMBASSADOR WHO NEGOTIATED WITH
 NORTH KOREA, BILL RICHARDSON.
 PLUS, BERNIE IS BACK.
 AND OUR 2016 POLITICAL
 CAMPAIGN BEGAN THE REVOLUTION.
 NOW IT IS TIME TO COMPLETE THAT
 REVOLUTION.
 HIS STAYING POWER SHOCKED THE
 POLITICAL WORLD IN 2016.
 HIS NATIONAL MOVEMENT IS A
 FUND-RAISING JUGGERNAUT.
 CAN HE STAY IN THE CYCLE OF THE
 WIDE OPEN RACE FOR THE WHITE
 HOUSE?
 OUR ROUND TABLE WEIGHS IN ON
 WHAT'S AT STAKE IN 2020, THE
 ISSUES AT PLAY AND WHO IS MAKING
 HEADWAY.
 WE'LL BREAK DOWN THE POLITICS,
 SMOKE OUT THE SPIN.
 THE FACTS THAT MATTER THIS WEEK.
 GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME TO
 "THIS WEEK."
 IT'S A BIG WEEK AHEAD FOR THE
 PRESIDENT ON TWO VERY DIFFERENT
 FRONTS.
 TOMORROW HE BOARDS AIR FORCE ONE
 FOR VIETNAM, THE SITE OF HIS
 SECOND SUMMIT WITH KIM JONG-UN
 WHO IS ON HIS WAY TO HANOI.
 YOU SEE HIM THERE ON HIS ARMORED
 TRAIN ARRIVING IN CHINA
 YESTERDAY.
 JUST AS TRUMP TRIES TO STRIKE A
 NUCLEAR DEAL WITH KIM JONG-UN,
 MICHAEL COHEN WILL TAKE THE
 WASHINGTON SPOTLIGHT.
 THREE DAYS OF HEARINGS ON
 CAPITOL HILL INCLUDING
 BLOCKBUSTER PUBLIC TESTIMONY IN
 THE HOUSE ON WEDNESDAY.
 COHEN'S LAWYER SAYS HE'S
 PREPARED TO REVEAL DAMNING
 DETAILS OF HIS YEARS AS TRUMP'S
 ATTORNEY AND FIXER.
 PROMISING A CHILLING PORTRAIT OF
 THE PRESIDENT.
 IT COMES AS COHEN CONTINUES TO
 COOPERATE WITH PROSECUTORS
 OFFERING LEADS, AND INSURANCE
 REGULARITIES AT THE TRUMP
 ORGANIZATION.
 AND THAT INVESTIGATION IN NEW
 YORK'S SOUTHERN DISTRICT, JUST
 ONE OF SEVERAL PROBES POISED TO
 CHALLENGE THE PRESIDENT WELL
 BEYOND THE END OF ROBERT
 MUELLER'S WORK.
 WE START WITH THE MAN LEADING
 ONE OF THOSE INVESTIGATIONS, THE
 CHAIR OF THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE
 COMMITTEE CONGRESSMAN SCHIFF.
 THANK YOU FOR JOINING US THIS
 MORNING.
 THANK YOU.
 MICHAEL COHEN APPEARING
 BEHIND CLOSED DOORS ON THURSDAY.
 WHAT DO YOU HOPE TO LEARN FROM
 HIM YOU DON'T ALREADY KNOW?
 A GREAT DEAL STARTING WITH
 WHY THE FALSE STATEMENTS BEFORE
 OUR COMMITTEE WHEN HE FIRST
 APPEARED.
 DID THEY GO BEYOND WHAT HE TOLD
 US ABOUT MOSCOW TRUMP TOWER INTO
 OTHER AREAS AS WELL?
 WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE
 FALSE TESTIMONY THAT HE WAS
 GIVING?
 WHAT OTHER LIGHT CAN HE SHED NOW
 THAT HE'S COOPERATING ON ISSUES
 OF OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE OR
 COLLUSION?
 WHAT MORE COULD HE TELL US ABOUT
 THE TRUMP TOWER NEW YORK MEETING
 OR ANY OTHER ISSUES RELEVANT TO
 OUR INVESTIGATION.
 WE THINK HE HAS A LOT TO OFFER.
 HOW ABOUT THE FINANCES OF THE
 TRUMP ORGANIZATION?
 YOU HAVE SUGGESTED THAT'S THE
 NEW FRONT IN YOUR COMMITTEE'S
 INVESTIGATION.
 WELL, THIS IS SOMETHING,
 GEORGE, AS YOU KNOW, I HAVE BEEN
 CONCERNED ABOUT FOR TWO YEARS
 NOW.
 WE WEREN'T REALLY PERMITTED TO
 EXPLORE IT IN GREAT DETAIL WHEN
 THE REPUBLICANS WERE RUNNING THE
 COMMITTEE, BUT WE KNOW ALREADY
 AND MICHAEL COHEN IS PIVOTAL TO
 THIS, THE PERIL OF IGNORING OR
 OBSERVING THIS RED LINE OF THE
 PRESIDENT'S AND IGNORING THE
 FINANCIAL ISSUES.
 WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED TO DATE
 ABOUT MOSCOW TRUMP TOWER IS
 CHILLING AND THAT IS AS DONALD
 TRUMP WAS CAMPAIGNING FOR
 PRESIDENT, EVEN WHEN IT BECAME
 THE PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE OF THE
 REPUBLICAN PARTY AND HE WAS
 TELLING THE COUNTRY HE HAD NO
 BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH RUSSIA,
 HE WAS PRIVATELY THROUGH HIS
 ORGANIZATION SEEKING THE
 KREMLIN'S HELP TO WHAT MAY HAVE
 BEEN THE MOST LUCRATIVE DEAL OF
 HIS LIFE, EVEN REPORTEDLY
 OFFERING AN INDUCEMENT TO PUTIN
 TO MAKE IT HAPPEN AND AT THE
 SAME TIME, TALKING ABOUT
 REMOVING SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA.
 THAT'S SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT
 TO THE RUSSIANS AND THAT IS
 DEEPLY COMPROMISING.
 WHETHER IT'S CRIMINAL OR NOT,
 IT'S DEEPLY COMPROMISING OF OUR
 NATIONAL SECURITY, SO THOSE
 ISSUES HAVE TO BE PROBED AND
 THEY INCLUDE MONEY LAUNDERING AS
 WELL.
 IF IT TURNS OUT AS THE
 PRESIDENT HAS SAID SO MANY TIMES
 THAT HE DID NOT COLLUDE WITH THE
 RUSSIANS TO INTERFERE IN THE
 ELECTION, BUT, IN FACT, HE WAS
 PURSUING THIS TRUMP TOWER AT THE
 SAME TIME, IF THAT'S NOT
 CRIMINAL, DOES MUELLER HAVE A
 RESPONSIBILITY TO REPORT IT OR
 NO?
 HE DOES HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY
 TO REPORT IT AND, IN FACT, IF
 YOU TAKE THE POSITION, AND I
 THINK IT'S A FLAWED ONE, BUT IF
 YOU TAKE THE POSITION THAT THE
 PRESIDENT CANNOT BE INDICTED AND
 THE ONLY REMEDY FOR IMPROPER,
 ILLEGAL OR OTHER CONDUCT IS
 IMPEACHMENT, THEN YOU CANNOT
 WITHHOLD THAT INFORMATION FROM
 CONGRESS.
 THAT CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO BE THE
 CASE.
 BILL BARR HAS COMMITTED IN HIS
 TESTIMONY TO MAKING AS YOUMUCH
 THE REPORT PUBLIC AS HE CAN, AND
 THE REGULATIONS WILL MAKE IT
 ALL.

 AND WE INSIST ON IT BECOMING
 PUBLIC AND WE INSIST ON THE
 UN
 UNDERLYING EVIDENCE BECAUSE
 THERE IS CERTAIN EVIDENCE IN THE
 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THAT WE
 CAN'T GET ANY OTHER WAY.
 THE SEARCHES WERE CONDUCTED FOR
 EXAMPLE OF ROGER STONE AND PAUL
 MANAFORT.
 THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO GET THE
 INVEST THAT WAS SEIZED EXCEPT
 THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT AND WE
 CAN'T TELL THE COUNTRY FULLY
 WHAT HAPPENED WITHOUT IT.
 WILLIAM BARR MAY HAVE A
 DIFFERENT VIEW ABOUT WHAT THOSE
 REGULATIONS REQUIRE THAN YOU DO.
 THEY COULD ALLOW HIM TO RELEASE
 THE ENTIRE REPORT, BUT UNDER
 JUSTICE DEPARTMENT REGULATIONS,
 OFFICIALS HAVE SAID THAT IF YOU
 DECLINE TO PROSECUTE SOMEONE,
 THE UNDERLYING EVIDENCE SHOULD
 NOT BE RELEASED.
 BUT GEORGE, THE DEPARTMENT
 HAS VIOLATED THAT POLICY
 REPEATEDLY, AND EXTENDEDLY -- TO
 A GREAT EXTENT OVER THE LAST TWO
 YEARS.
 I HAVE HAD THIS CONVERSATION
 WITH ROD ROSENSTEIN AND OTHERS
 DOWN AT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
 AS THEY TURNED OVER THOUSANDS
 AND THOUSANDS OF PAGES OF
 DISCOVERY IN THE CLINTON E-MAIL
 INVESTIGATION AND THERE WAS NO
 INDICTMENT IN THAT
 INVESTIGATION, THAT THIS WAS A
 NEW PRECEDENT THEY WERE SETTING
 AND THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE TO
 LIVE BY THIS PRECEDENT WHETHER
 IT WAS A CONGRESS CONTROLLED BY
 THE DEMOCRATS OR REPUBLICANS.
 SO THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
 ABIDE BY THIS, AND I THINK ALSO
 QUITE SEPARATE APART FROM THE
 PRESIDENT AS THEY HAVE ALREADY
 SAID IS THE INTENSE PUBLIC NEED
 TO KNOW HERE WHICH I THINK
 OVERRIDES ANY CONSIDERATION.
 YOU SEE THE JUSTICE
 DEPARTMENT IS GOING TO HAVE TO
 LIVE BY THIS PRECEDENT, BUT WHAT
 IF THEY DON'T?
 WHAT IF THEY SAY NO?
 WHAT PGSOPTIONS DO THEY HAVE?
 WE WILL SUBPOENA THE REPORT
 AND BRING BOB MUELLER IN TO
 TESTIFY BEFORE CONGRESS AND TAKE
 IT TO COURT IF NECESSARY.
 AND IN THE ENDS, I THINK THE
 DEPARTMENT UNDERSTANDS THEY'RE
 GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE THIS
 PUBLIC.
 I THINK BARR WILL ULTIMATELY
 UNDERSTAND THAT AS WELL.
 BARR COMES INTO THIS JOB WITH
 TWO STRIKES AGAINST HIM.
 HE APPLIED FOR THE JOB BY BE
 DEMONSTRATING A BIAS AGAINST THE
 MUELLER INVESTIGATION.
 THAT'S PART OF THE REASON HE WAS
 HIRED.
 HE HAS ALSO NOT BEEN COMMITTED
 TO FOLLOWING THE ADVICE OF THE
 ETHICS COMMITTEE.
 IF HE WERE TRY TO WITHHOLD ANY
 PART OF THIS REPORT, THAT WILL
 BE HIS LEGACY AND IT WILL BE A
 TARNISHED LEGACY.
 I THINK THERE WILL BE IMMENSE
 PRESSURE NOT ONLY ON THE
 DEPARTMENT, BUT ON THE ATTORNEY
 GENERAL TO BE FORTHCOMING.
 YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PUBLIC
 PRESSURE.
 ARE YOU PREPARED TO TAKE THE
 ADMINISTRATION TO COURT?
 ABSOLUTELY.
 WE'RE GOING TO GET TO THE BOTTOM
 OF THIS, AND WE SHARE THIS
 INFORMATION WITH THE PUBLIC, AND
 IF THE PRESIDENT IS SERIOUS
 ABOUT ALL OF HIS CLAIMS OF
 EXONERATION, THEN HE SHOULD
 WELCOME THE PUBLICATION OF THIS
 REPORT.
 THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID NO
 COLLUSION MANY TIMES AS I SAID.
 YOU SAID MANY MONTHS AGO THAT
 YOU HAVE ALREADY DEVELOPED
 EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION.
 WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT FROM ROBERT
 MUELLER.
 DO YOU HAVE ANY EVIDENCE AT ALL
 THAT THE PRESIDENT COLLUDED?
 GEORGE, THERE IS AMPLE
 EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION OF THE
 CAMPAIGN, AND IT'S VERY MUCH IN
 THE PUBLIC RECORD, AND IT'S
 EVERYTHING FROM WHAT WE HAVE
 SEEN RECENTLY ABOUT PAUL
 MANAFORT MEETING WITH SOMEONE
 LINKED TO RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE
 AND SHARING POLLING DATA, AND
 NOT TOP LINE DATA.
 NOT THIS IS WHY WE THINK TRUMP
 IS GOING TO WIN DATA, BUT RAW
 DATA, COMPLICATED DATA.
 WE HAVE SEEN EVIDENCE OF ROGER
 STONE IN COMMUNICATION WITH
 WIKILEAKS.
 WE HAVE SEEN THE PRESIDENT'S SON
 HAVING A SECRET MEETING AT TRUMP
 TOWER THAT WAS PRESENTED TO HIM
 AS PART OF THE RUSSIAN
 GOVERNMENT'S EFFORT TO HELP THE
 TRUMP CAMPAIGN.
 HIS ACCEPTANCE OF THAT HELP IS
 INTERESTING.
 GETTING THAT -- ALL OF THIS IS
 EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION AND THERE
 IS MUCH, MUCH MORE.
 WHETHER THAT WILL AMOUNT TO A
 CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY THAT COULD
 BE PROVED BEYOND A REASONABLE
 DOUBT, WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT FOR
 BOB MUELLER TO TELL US, BUT NOT
 TO SEE WHAT IS PLAINLY IN FRONT
 OF US MEANS YOU BASICALLY DON'T
 WANT TO SEE THE EVIDENCE OF
 COLLUSION BECAUSE IT IS QUITE
 ABUN TANT.
 CONGRESSMAN SCHIFF, THANK YOU
 FOR YOUR TIME.
 LET'S BRING IN DAN ABRAMS AND
 ALAN DERSHOWITZ, AUTHOR OF "THE
 CASE AGAINST," AND LET'S TALK
 ABOUT WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT
 WITH CONGRESSMAN SCHIFF RIGHT
 THERE.
 HE SAYS THAT BILL BARR IS UNDER
 TREMENDOUS PRESSURE TO RELEASE
 WHATEVER HE'S -- WHATEVER
 MUELLER HAS REPORTED PUBLICLY.
 IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT BARR AGREES
 WITH THAT.
 THAT'S RIGHT.
 BARR HAS MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT
 HE'S GOING TO RELEASE AS MUCH AS
 HE CAN, BUT HE HAS PUT CAVEATS
 ON THAT, AND THE QUESTION WILL
 BE FOR EXAMPLE, HOW MUCH
 INFORMATION IN THERE POTENTIALLY
 COULD BE A NATIONAL SECURITY
 THREAT?
 AND I THINK YOU NEED TO SEPARATE
 OUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE
 REPORTED SELF AND THE UNDERLYING
 INFORMATION BECAUSE YOU HEARD
 CONGRESSMAN SCHIFF THERE TALKING
 ABOUT SOME OF THE UNDERLYING
 INFORMATION.
 THAT'S GOING TO BE HARDER TO
 GET.
 EVEN THOUGH IT WAS ALL
 RELEASED IN THE CLINTON
 INVESTIGATION?
 CORRECT.
 YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THE
 CURRENT SPECIAL COUNSEL LAW WAS
 A RESPONSE TO THE CLINTON
 INVESTIGATION MEANING THERE WERE
 CONCERNS ABOUT HOW MUCH --
 BILL CLINTON INVESTIGATION.
 THE HILLARY CLINTON --
 YOU'RE RIGHT.
 IN RESPONSE TO THE BILL CLINTON
 INVESTIGATION, THIS IS A
 RESPONSE TO THAT LAW.
 ON THE HILLARY CLINTON
 INVESTIGATION, LOOK.
 I DON'T THINK THERE IS A DIRECT
 COMPARISON BETWEEN THE HILLARY
 CLINTON INVESTIGATION AND THE
 SPECIAL COUNSEL INVESTIGATION.
 I DO THINK THAT THERE IS A MUCH
 STRONGER ARGUMENT TO SAY THAT A
 SPECIAL COUNSEL INVESTIGATION
 OUGHT TO BE MADE PUBLIC EVEN IF
 THERE IS NO PROSECUTION, THAT
 THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS FOR
 THEM, THAT THE REPORT SHOULD BE
 MADE PUBLIC EVEN IF IN TYPICALLY
 IN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE,
 YOU WOULDN'T RELEASE INFORMATION
 RELATED TO AN INVESTIGATION THAT
 WAS NOT PROSECUTED.
 WHAT'S YOUR SPOPS RESPONSE T,
 ALAN?
 I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY THE
 ISSUE.
 DEMOCRATS WERE APPROPRIATELY
 FURIOUS.
 I WAS AMONG THEM WHEN COMEY
 AFTER SAYING THAT HE WAS NOT
 GOING TO INDICT HILLARY CLINTON,
 THEN WENT ON TO GIVE HIS OWN
 OPINION AS TO HER WRONGDOING,
 AND THE QUESTION IS, IS THERE A
 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COMEY WHO DID
 WRONG?
 EVERYBODY NOW ACKNOWLEDGES THAT,
 AND A SPECIAL COUNSEL WHO HAS
 HAD A BROADER MANDATE TO
 INVESTIGATE.
 LET'S BE REALISTIC.
 IN THE END, EVERYTHING IS COME
 OUT.
 THERE ARE NO SECRETS.
 IN THE END, IT'S ALL GOING TO
 COME OUT AND IN THE END, AS I
 SAID FROM DAY ONE, IT ONE OF SO
 MUCH BETTER IF WE HAD A
 NONPARTISAN, INDEPENDENT
 COMMISSION LIKE THEY HAVE IN
 ENGLAND AND IN ISRAEL, LIKE WE
 HAD AFTER 9/11, GETTING TO THE
 WHOLE TRUTH IN A NONPARTISAN
 WAY.
 THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IS NOT GOING
 TO TRUST DEMOCRATIC CONTROL OF
 THE HOUSE.
 LET ME STOP YOU.
 THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TRUST
 THE REPUBLICAN-CONTROLLED
 SENATE.
 MUELLER IS ABOUT AS
 NONPARTISAN AS YOU COULD HAVE
 FOUND, ISN'T HE?
 IF HIS INFORMATION IS NOT
 RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC AND IT
 THEN GOES TO CONGRESS TO CONDUCT
 THE INVESTIGATION, I THINK THERE
 WILL BE A QUESTION OF
 CREDIBILITY.
 LOOK.
 I THINK AND I HAVE SAID FROM DAY
 ONE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
 GREATEST VULNERABILITY LIES NOT
 WITH THE MUELLER REPORT, BUT
 WITH THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF
 NEW YORK AND WITH THE NEW YORK
 ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE, AND
 WITH OTHER PROSECUTORIAL ARMS
 THAT CAN LOOK INTO CONDUCT
 UNRELATED TO COLLUSION TO
 RUSSIA, BUT CONDUCT PRECEDING
 HIS PRESIDENCY AND THAT'S WHERE
 PROBLEMS CAN COME UP IN THE
 FUTURE.
 THIS MAY BE JUST THE BEGINNING.
 THE MUELLER REPORT MAY BE JUST A
 ROAD MAP GIVEN TO CONGRESS AND
 GIVEN TO OTHER PROSECUTORS THAT
 WILL CONTINUE THESE
 INVESTIGATIONS UNTIL THE END OF
 PRESIDENT TRUMP.
 WE MAY BE HAVING A MUELLER
 STRATEGY IN PLAIN SIGHT.
 EVERY INDICTMENT HE HAS LAYS OUT
 IN GREAT DETAIL WHAT HE THOUGHT
 HAPPENED.
 IN THE MEANTIME, THINGS THAT HE
 THINKS MAY BE A BIT BEYOND HIS
 SCOPE, HE SIPHONS OFF TO OTHER
 PROSECUTORS.
 RIGHT, AND I THINK ALAN IS
 RIGHT THAT POSES AN ENORMOUS
 DANGER TO HIM IN THE OFFICE.
 YOU CAN'T JUST SAY THE SOUTHERN
 DISTRICT OF NEW YORK IS OUT TO
 GET ME AND THE EASTERN DISTRICT
 OF NEW YORK IS OUT TO GET ME AND
 VIRGINIA IS OUT TO GET ME, ET
 CETERA.
 THAT'S A TOUGH ARGUMENT TO MAKE,
 BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT --
 I AGREE.
 SOME OF THE DOCUMENTS THAT
 HAVE BEEN FILED LIKE IN THE
 MANAFORT CASE, AND THE ROAD MAP,
 YOU HAVE TO ASK THE QUESTION AND
 THE BIG PICTURE, WHY IS SO MUCH
 REDACTED?
 WHY ARE THEY STILL NOT ALLOWING
 THE PUBLIC TO SEE SO MUCH
 RELATED TO THE RUSSIA
 INVESTIGATION?
 WHY ISN'T MICHAEL COHEN BEING
 ALLOWED TO TESTIFY IN PUBLIC
 ABOUT THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION?
 HE'S ONLY GOING TO BE TALKING
 ABOUT OTHER INVESTIGATIONS.
 TEN OTHER TOPICS NOT RELATED
 TO RUSSIA.
 IF THERE IS NOTHING ELSE THAT'S
 GOING TO COME OUT, WHY ARE THEY
 REDACTING SO MUCH?
 800 PAGES FROM ROBERT MUELLER
 YESTERDAY IN THE MANAFORT
 SENTENCING MEMO, YET NOTHING
 ABOUT THE UNDERLYING THINGS HE
 MAY HAVE BEEN LYING ABOUT.
 HIS MEETINGS WITH VARIOUS
 RUSSIANS AND THEY SAY THE
 REDACTIONS WERE FOR ONGOING
 INVESTIGATIONS AND UNCHARGED
 INDIVIDUALS.
 THAT DOES SUGGEST MORE TO COMP.
 OH, ABSOLUTELY.
 I HAVE NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.
 I THINK THESE REDACTIONS ARE A
 CLUE TO WHAT MAY BE HINTED AT.
 LOOK.
 ALSO I THINK WE ARE SEEING NOW
 AN EFFORT TO TAMP DOWN
 EXPECTATIONS FROM THE MUELLER
 REPORT ITSELF.
 I THINK WE'RE BEING TOLD, DON'T
 EXPECT SMOKING GUNS.
 DON'T EXPECT DYNAMITE IN THE
 REPORT.
 THE REPORT IS GOING TO BE THE
 BEGINNING OF SOME OTHER
 INVESTIGATIONS COMING DOWN THE
 LINE SO I THINK THERE IS A
 COMBINATION.
 DON'T EXPECT TOO MUCH FROM THE
 MUELLER REPORT ITSELF, BUT THE
 MUELLER REPORT MAY LEAD TO
 GREATER INVESTIGATIONS BY A
 VARIETY OF OTHER INSTITUTIONS SO
 THIS -- THE MUELLER REPORT IS
 NOT GOING TO MARK THE END OF THE
 INVESTIGATION.
 I THINK THAT'S THE MESSAGE WE'RE
 HEARING.
 SO MUCH REPORTING ON THE
 MUELLER REPORT.
 IT'S UNFOUNDED BECAUSE ROBERT
 MUELLER ISN'T TALKING AND THERE
 HAS BEEN RATHER AGGRESSIVE
 BACKGROUNDING GOING ON
 SUGGESTING THAT THE MUELLER
 REPORT WILL BE AN ANTI-CLIMAX.
 YEAH, AND LOOK.
 THE EXPECTATION GAME IS CRITICAL
 WHEN IT COMES TO PUBLIC
 PERCEPTION, BUT WHETHER IT'S A
 SUMMARY, WHETHER IT'S A DETAILED
 ACCOUNTING, DON'T FORGET WE
 ALREADY HAVE A LOT OF
 INFORMATION, AND I'M NOT JUST
 TALKING ABOUT WHAT CONGRESSMAN
 SCHIFF WAS TALKING ABOUT, BUT
 THE INDICTMENTS THAT CURRENTLY
 EXIST.
 WHEN PEOPLE WANT TO NE WHAT
 HAPPENED LEADING UP TO THE 2016
 ELECTION, YOU HAVE TO START BY
 READING THE INDICTMENTS.
 YOU HAVE TO START BY READING THE
 INDICTMENTS OF THE RUSSIANS AND
 THEN ASK YOURSELF, OKAY.
 WAS ANYONE ELSE CONNECTED TO
 THEM, AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE
 TRYING TO PIECE TOGETHER STILL.
 WHEN YOU HAVE PAPADOPOULOS
 LYING, FLYNN LYING ABOUT RUSSIA.
 YOU HAVE GOT MANAFORT LYING, ET
 CETERA.
 YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF,WHY ARE
 ALL THESE PEOPLE NOT TELLING THE
 TRUTH?
 THE ANSWER MAY SIMPLY BE, YOU
 KNOW, LOOK.
 I WANTED TO DISTANCE MYSELF FROM
 IT.
 I DIDN'T WANT TO GET IN TROUBLE
 IN CONNECTION WITH THIS THING,
 BUT THERE ARE STILL CRITICAL
 QUESTIONS THAT ARE UNANSWERED.
 THERE IS A TON OF REDACTED
 MATERIAL, AND, YOU KNOW, I
 THINK -- WE'RE GOING TO SEE SOME
 ANSWERS.
 WE'RE WAITING FOR ROBERT
 MUELLER.
 LET'S REMEMBER THOUGH.
 GO AHEAD.
 INDICTMENTS ARE DIFFERENT
 THAN CONVICTIONS AND A LOT OF
 THIS IS INDICTMENTS AND REMEMBER
 TOO.
 WE'RE GOING TO SEE A REBUTTAL
 REPORT FROM THE TRUMP TEAM.
 I THINK THE AMERICAN PUBLISHER
 WILL WITHHOLD FINAL JUDGMENT
 UNTIL THEY SEE BOTH REPORTS.
 THIS WILL BE THE FIRST TIME
 IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICA WHERE
 A DEFENDANT OR SOMEONE WHO IS
 ACCUSED OF SOMETHING GETS TO
 WRITE A RESPONSE REPORT TO WHAT
 AN INDICTMENT IS.
 EVERY CRIMINAL DEFENDANT IN
 AMERICA WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO
 WRITE THEIR OWN REPORT ABOUT
 WHAT THEY SAY HAPPENED, BUT
 THAT'S NOT THE WAY THE SYSTEM
 WORKS.
 YOU'RE CONTRADICTS YOURSELF.
 THIS IS NOT JUST A YES OR NO.
 YOU'RE SAYING THAT SPECIAL
 COUNSEL HAVE SPECIAL OBLIGATIONS
 TO RELEASE EVERYTHING.
 YES.
 IF THEY HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO
 RELEASE EVERYTHING, THEY CAN
 ALLOW A RESPONSE.
 LET HIM RESPOND.
 LET HIM RESPOND.
 YES OR NO, YOU WOULDN'T NEED
 A RESPONSE, BUT IF YOU GET A
 LONG, LONG NARRATIVE, THEN
 FAIRNESS REQUIRES A RESPONSE.
 THAT'S FINE.
 LET HIM RESPOND.
 SIMULTANEOUS RELEASE OF BOTH.
 BOTH TOO.
 RIGHT.
 YES.
 THAT'S JUST -- THAT'S
 RIDICULOUS THE IDEA THAT YOU
 HAVE TO ALLOW THE OTHER SIDE IN
 SOMETHING LIKE THIS, THE
 OPPORTUNITY TO FILE A LONG
 REPORT IN RESPONSE TO A
 PROSECUTOR.
 YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT IF
 YOU JUST LIMIT YOURSELF TO
 INDICTMENT OR NOT INDICTMENT,
 BUT IF YOU GO BEYOND IT AND YOU
 START TELLING A STORY, THE OTHER
 SIDE OF THE NARRATIVE HAS TO BE
 PRODUCED AS WELL.
 THAT'S REQUIRED BY FAIRNESS AND
 DUE PROCESS.
 BILL CLINTON WOULD LOVE THAT.
 NOT IN THE REGULATIONS.
 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
 WHEN WE COME BACK, ANDREW
 McCABE UP NEXT, AND THE ROUND
 TABLE TAKES ON 2020.
 THAT WILL BE UP NEXT.

        I saw my dentist.

 I THINK ANDREW McCABE HAS MADE A FOOL OUT OF HIMSELF OVER
 THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS AND HE
 LOOKED TO ME LIKE A POOR MAN'S
 J. EDGAR HOOVER.
 I THINK HE'S A DISASTER, AND
 WHAT HE WAS TRYING TO DO IS
 TERRIBLE AND HE WAS CAUGHT.
 I'M VERY PROUD TO SAY WE CAUGHT
 HIM.
 SO WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS, BUT
 HE -- HE IS A DISGRACED MAN.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP TAKING ON OUR
 NEXT GUEST, ANDREW McCABE.
 HIS NEW BOOK, "THE THREAT: HOW
 THE FBI PROTECTS AMERICA IN THE
 AGE OF TERROR AND TRUMP," TAKES
 US BEHIND THE SCENES OF THE
 LAUNCH OF THE MUELLER
 INVESTIGATION.
 WELCOME TO "THIS WEEK."
 POOR MAN'S J. EDGAR HOOVER?
 I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT
 MEANS.
 THAT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME I HAVE
 HAD TO LISTEN TO THE PRESIDENT
 SAY BIZARRE AND UNTRUE THINGS
 ABOUT ME, SO IT'S UNFORTUNATE
 THIS IS GETTING A LITTLE BIT
 ROUTINE, BUT I WILL SAY, YOU
 KNOW, I DON'T THINK THERE IS
 ANYTHING SAD OR UNFORTUNATE
 ABOUT SPEAKING TRUTH TO POWER
 AND TELLING THE STORY THAT YOU
 LIVED AND THE THINGS YOU SAW AND
 HEARD AND THE REASONS BEHIND THE
 DECISIONS YOU MADE AND THAT'S
 WHAT I HAVE TRIED TO DO WITH THE
 BOOK.
 ANOTHER MAN WHO HAS A
 REPUTATION, MUELLER.
 YOU WORKED FOR HIM AT THE FBI.
 I DID.
 BASED ON WHAT YOU KNOW, AND
 YOU HEARD OUR PREVIOUS
 DISCUSSION.
 WHAT SHOULD WE EXPECT FROM
 ROBERT MUELLER?
 KIND OF A NARROW BY THE BOOK
 PROSECUTOR REPORTING OR SOMEONE
 WHO SENSES HE HAS A BROADER
 RESPONSIBILITY TO THE PUBLIC?
 YOU KNOW, IT'S A GREAT
 QUESTION, GEORGE.
 I THINK FIRST AND FOREMOST WHAT
 YOU CAN EXPECT FROM ROBERT
 MUELLER IS AN HONEST,
 INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT OF THE
 WORK THAT THEY HAVE DONE.
 HOW MUCH DETAIL HE CHOOSES TO GO
 INTO, TO CONVEY TO THE
 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS A GREAT
 QUESTION.
 I HOPE THEY LEAN ON THE DETAILED
 SIDE.
 THIS IS NOT A NORMAL
 INVESTIGATION BY ANY EVALUATION.
 IT'S ONE THAT I THINK THE
 DEPARTMENT, CONGRESS AND THE
 PUBLIC HAVE ENORMOUS INTEREST IN
 FINDING OUT WHAT THEY ARE.
 IT'S COMPLICATED IN SO MANY
 WAYS INCLUDING THE PRECEDENT OF
 THE HILLARY CLINTON
 INVESTIGATION.
 THAT'S RIGHT.
 THE FBI RELEASED ALL THAT
 INFORMATION ABOUT HER.
 AS YOU HEARD ALAN DERSHOWITZ,
 AND COMEY WAS CRITICIZED FOR
 THAT.
 WAS THAT THE WRONG DECISION BY
 COMEY?
 I AGREED WITH HIS APPROACH AT
 THE TIME, AND INSUSINCE THE BEN
 OF SOME RECONSIDERATION OF THE
 THINGS WE DID, AND I THINK I'M
 PRETTY CLEAR ABOUT IT IN THE
 BOOK, I THINK THAT THAT DECISION
 WAS NOT WELL THOUGHT.
 I THINK WE UNDERESTIMATED THE
 KIND OF POLITICAL TOXICITY OF
 THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE WERE
 LAUNCHING OUR CONCLUSIONS INTO
 AND WE OVERESTIMATED OUR ABILITY
 AND JIM'S ABILITY TO CONVINCE
 PEOPLE OF THE GREAT WORK WE HAD
 DONE.
 THE CASE FILE IS PRECEDENT,
 AND IS IT ONE THE FBI SHOULD
 FOLLOW IN THIS INVESTIGATION?
 I'M NOT SURE JIM'S DECISION
 TO ANNOUNCE IT IN JULY IS A
 PRECEDENT.
 HOWEVER, I THINK THAT IT IS A
 VERY CONCERNING AND NOW RECENT
 PRECEDENT.
 THE VOLUME OF INFORMATION THAT
 THE FBI TURNED OVER TO CONGRESS
 IN THE WAKE OF AFTER THE
 INVESTIGATION WAS CONCLUDED.
 THAT IS SOMETHING THAT CONCERNED
 ME GREATLY AT THAT TIME, AND I
 THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, THIS IS A --
 THIS IS A PRACTICE THAT WILL BE
 HARD TO STEP AWAY FROM.
 YOU MADE THE DECISION TO
 INVESTIGATE THE PRESIDENT.
 COMING IS SOME CRITICISM FROM
 CONGRESSMAN MARK MEADOWS.
 YOU SAID IT WAS BECAUSE OF
 SUSPICIOUS BEHAVIOR BY THE
 PRESIDENT, AND OTHER SECRET
 EVIDENCE.
 CONGRESSMAN MEADOWS SAYS THAT IS
 AN ABUSIE OF POWER.
 I'M NOT SURE WHAT HE'S
 REFERRING TO THERE, BUT I CAN
 TELL YOU THAT THE INFORMATION
 THAT WAS IN OUR HANDS AT THE
 TIME, MUCH OF WHICH IS PUBLICLY
 KNOWN, CAUSED US GREAT CONCERN.
 YOU SAY US, BUT THIS WAS YOUR
 DECISION, RIGHT?
 THIS WAS THE DRECOMMENDATION
 FROM THE INVESTIGATIVE TEAM AND
 IT WAS MY DECISION TO AUTHORIZE
 THE OPENING OF THE CASE AND I
 DID THAT BECAUSE AT THE TIME,
 THE FACTS CLEARLY INDICATED WE
 HAD BASIS TO BELIEVE THAT A
 CRIME MAY HAVE BEEN COMMITTED
 AND THAT A THREAT TO NATIONAL
 SECURITY MIGHT EXIST.
 WE HADN'T CONCLUDED EITHER OF
 THOSE TWO THINGS HAD HAPPENED,
 BUT WE WERE CERTAINLY IN THE
 PLACE WE NEEDED TO INVESTIGATE
 BOTH SIDES.
 YOU'RE PLANNING ON FILING A
 CIVIL LAWSUIT AGAINST PRESIDENT
 TRUMP.
 WHAT GROUNDS DO YOU HAVE TO SUE
 AND WHAT DO YOU HOPE TO GET FROM
 IT?
 I CAN'T TALK IN GREAT DETAIL
 ABOUT THE LAWSUIT.
 I'LL LET THE PLEADINGS SPEAK FOR
 THEMSELVES.
 IT WILL BE AN ACTION AGAINST THE
 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE PRIMARILY
 AND CHALLENGING THE
 CIRCUMSTANCES OF MY FIRING.
 IT OF COURSE, DERIVES FROM THE
 INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORT, A
 REPORT I DEEPLY DISAGREE WITH,
 AND IT WAS A RESULT OF A PROCESS
 THAT I DON'T THINK ANYONE HAS
 EVER SEEN BEFORE.
 I CERTAINLY HADN'T.
 EXCUSE ME.
 DO YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT
 INSPIRED THAT PROCESS?
 THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND
 THAT THE PRESIDENT'S CLEAR
 DESIRE IMPACTED THAT PROCESS.
 THE PRESIDENT WAS TALKING ABOUT
 REMOVING ME FOR MONTHS BEFORE I
 EVER INTERACTED WITH THE
 INSPECTOR GENERAL.
 HE MADE HIS DESIRES PERFECTLY
 CLEAR ON HIS OWN TWITTER FEED.
 THE INSPECTOR GENERAL DELIVERED
 THAT RESULT.
 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
 THANK YOU, GEORGE.
 ROUND TABLE IS UP NEXT.
 WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

 I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IN THE YEARS TO COME, THE SAME
 OPPORTUNITIES THATER THERE
 FOR ME, A KID THAT GREW UP IN
 THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN TEXAS, CAN
 BE THERE FOR ANYBODY.
 I'M IN THIS FIGHT BECAUSE I
 TRULY DO BELIEVE THIS IS OUR
 MOMENT.
 I BELIEVE IT IS TIME TO
 RESTORE TRUTH AND JUSTICE.
 HOW ABOUT THAT?
 YOU SEE EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT
 PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TRYING TO
 UNDERMINE OUR CONSTITUTION.
 I AM GOING TO RUN FOR
 PRESIDENT.
 WHAT'S GOING TO BE DIFFERENT
 THIS TIME?
 WE'RE GOING TO WIN.
 FIRST VOTES ARE A YEAR AWAY,
 BUT THE CAMPAIGN IN FULL SWING
 THIS FEBRUARY.
 LET'S TALK ABOUT IT WITH OUR
 ROUND TABLE, WITH CHRIS
 CHRISTIE.
 HEIDI HEIDCAMP, AND OUR REPORTER
 FROM "THE WASHINGTON POST."
 WELCOME TO YOU.
 WE HAVE OUR POLITICAL AFFAIRS
 DIRECTOR, AND ALEX CASTKAS YAW
 KNOWS.
 LET'S START WITH BERNIE SANDERS.
 HE SAYS HE'S GOING TO WIN THIS
 TIME AROUND.
 77 YEARS OLD AND ALREADY
 TARGETED BY THE PRESIDENT AS A
 DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST, BUT 24
 HOURS INTO HIS ANNOUNCEMENT OF
 THAT FUND-RAISING BASE.
 $6 MILLION IN RIGHT AWAY, AND
 ANOTHER $6,000 FROM PEOPLE WHO
 LE
 PLEDGED TO GIVE HIM EVERY SINGLE
 MONTH.
 IT'S LIKE THE NETFLIX FOR
 RUNNING A CAMPAIGN.
 HE'S GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE
 THIS TIME AROUND.
 I WORKED ON HOWARD DEAN'S
 CAMPAIGN.
 AGAINST JOHN CARRIGAN.
 AND EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE
 WORLD, AND THERE WAS A SENSE IT
 WAS A BATTLE FOR THE HEARTS AND
 MINDS OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY,
 BUT AT SOME POINT IN IOWA, NEW
 HAMPSHIRE, EARLY ON, DEPARTMENTS
 DECIDED WE DON'T WANT A
 REVOLUTION.
 WE WANT TO BEAT GEORGE BUSH.
 BERNIE SANDERS IS GOING TO FIND
 THIS TIME PEOPLE DON'T WANT A
 REVOLUTION BUT THEY WANT DONALD
 TRUMP.
 BERNIE SANDERS, HIS IDEAS
 HAVE BEEN ADOPTED BY MANY OTHER
 CANDIDATES, MANY OTHER
 DEMOCRATS, BUT THERE IS THAT
 CONCERN THAT HE'S GOING TO PULL
 THE PARTY TOO FAR TO THE LEFT.
 WELL, I THINK THAT A COUPLE
 OF THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN.
 YOU'RE GOING TO SEE PEOPLE GET
 IN WHO ARE GOING TO BROADEN THE
 SCOPE OF DEMOCRATIC IDEAS THAT
 ARE GOING TO BE PUT ON THE
 FOREFRONT, BUT TO THE POINT OF
 THE MONEY, MONEY DOESN'T MATTER
 AS MUCH AS WHAT IT USED TO IN MY
 OPINION.
 WHEN YOU STEP BACK AND TAKE A
 LOOK AT KIND OF THE RECORD
 CROWDS THAT EVERYBODY'S ENJOYING
 IN IOWA -- I MEAN PEOPLE ARE
 COMING OUT BECAUSE THEY WANT TO
 EXAMINE EACH CANDIDATE AND PICK
 THE CANDIDATE WHO IN THEIR MIND,
 THE HIGHEST PRIORITY IS WHO CAN
 BEAT THIS PRESIDENT.
 MONEY MAY NOT MATTER, BUT THE
 SIGN YOU HAVE THIS MOVEMENT
 BEHIND YOU COULD.
 IT COULD AND I DISAGREE WITH
 THE SENATOR HAVING GONE THROUGH
 IT A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.
 MONEY MATTERS AND WHOEVER
 EMERGES OUT OF THIS WILL WIND UP
 HAVING A HUGE TARGET ON THEIR
 BACK WHEN THEY START TO DO WELL,
 AND THEY HAVE TO HAVE THE MONEY
 TO ANSWER, AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE
 THE MONEY TO ANSWER, YOU'RE
 GOING TO LOSE BECAUSE I LOVE ALL
 THE CHARACTERIZATION OF IOWA AND
 NEW HAMPSHIRE VOTERS ESPECIALLY
 EARLY AS BEING SO DISCERNING AND
 THEY WANT TO COME AND MEET YOU
 IN PERSON.
 THEY WANT TO MEET EVERYBODY IN
 PERSON, BUT THEY ALSO WATCH WHAT
 COMES IN THEIR MAILBOX AND WHAT
 COMES OVER THE TV AND GUYS
 WOULDN'T HAVE MADE THE FORTUNE
 HE HAS MADE.
 SANDERS WILL MATTER, BUT, YOU
 KNOW, IT'S A REPUBLICAN DREAM
 THAT SANDERS COULD BE THE
 NOMINEE.
 CAN I JUMP IN AND SAY IT'S
 INCREASE INGLY -- THE DEMOCRATSN
 CAPITOL HILL AND DEMOCRATS
 JUMPING IN ON 2020 ARE BECOMING
 INCREASINGLY GLARING WHERE YOU
 SEE THE CANDIDATES SUPPORTING
 MEDICARE FOR ALL?
 THE NEW DEAL, AND FREE COLLEGE
 GETTING CORPORATE MONEY IT OF
 POLITICS ON CAPITOL HILL.
 NANCY PELOSI IS KEEPING HER --
 SHE'S HOLDING THE LINE
 AGAINST SOME OF HER NEW MEMBERS
 AS WELL THERE.
 THEY'RE INTRODUCING IDEAS,
 BUT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE
 VOTED ON ON THE FLOOR AND THERE
 IS A REASON FOR THAT, AND THAT'S
 BECAUSE MOST DEMOCRATS ON THE
 HILL ARE AFRAID OF THESE IDEAS
 AND I THINK THEY GO TOO FAR.
 IT'S A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.
 POLITICS WILL JUST SWAMP PUBLIC
 POLICY OVER THE COURSE OF THE
 NEXT 18 MONTHS OF OR SO.
 THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE
 CAREFUL.
 THAT SHOWS.
 IT SHOWS.
 IT SHOWS THE DIVIDE IN THE PARTY
 THOUGH.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP LOVES BERNIE
 SANDERS FRONT AND CENTER.
 HE COULDN'T BE THAT LUCKY
 AGAIN, COULD HE?
 THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS GOING AS
 CRAZY FAR LEFT AS REPUBLICANS
 DID FAR RIGHT UNDER OBAMA, AND
 IT'S A GIFT.
 I MEAN, SOCIALISM DIDN'T WORK
 FOR THE PILGRIMS THE FIRST TWO
 YEARS HALF OF THEM DIED AND NOW
 THAT'S THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY
 AGENDA.
 THERE ARE THREE DEMOCRATIC
 PRIMARIES TO TAKE ON TRUMP AND
 ALL TO HAVE THEM ARE GOING,
 THERE'S THE ESTABLISHMENT
 PRIMARY WITH BIDEN AND
 KLOBUCHAR.
 WHAT ABOUT THE QUAKERS?
 THAT WAS THEIR MODEL.
 YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THE
 PROGRESSIVE PRIMARY, WHICH
 SANDERS HAS THE MONEY AND THE
 LEAD AND YOU HAVE KAMALA HARRIS
 AND CORY BOOKER FOR THE OBAMA
 BLACK PRIMARY.
 I THINK KAMALA HARRIS IS GOING
 TO SUCCEED IN THAT ONE, AND YOU
 WILL SEE BERNIE SANDERS AND
 MAYBE KLOBUCHAR.
 KAMALA HARRIS CAN GO BEYOND.
 SHE'S BEING PEGGED --
 I THINK THERE IS NO SUCH
 THING AS THE OBAMA BLACK
 PRIMARY.
 I THINK KAMALA --
 YES, THERE IS.
 THEY ARE BOTH EXTRAORDINARY
 CANDIDATES WHO CAN APPEAL.
 THAT'S MY POINT ABOUT KAMALA
 HARRIS.
 I AGREE WITH, THAT BUT THAT'S --
 RIGHT NOW THE DEMOCRATIC
 PRIMARIES --
 YOU'RE ALL JUDGING -- YOU'RE
 ALL JUDGING THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY
 IDEAS BY THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN
 NOW.
 WHAT HAPPENS WHEN MICHAEL
 BENNETT GETS IN?
 WHAT HAPPENS WHEN CHERYL BROWN
 GETS IN?
 WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU SEE
 BLOOMBERG GET IN?
 YOU MENTIONED JOE BIDEN.
 DO YOU THINK HE'LL GET IN?
 I DO.
 I THINK THE VICE PRESIDENT WILL
 FEEL A CALLING AND FEEL A
 NECESSITY TO BRING THAT GRAVITAS
 AND I THINK THE MINUTE HE GETS
 IN, HE'S GOING TO BE THE
 RECOGNIZED FRONT RUNNER.
 THERE IS AN OPENING FOR THAT
 RIGHT NOW.
 HE HAS NAME I.D., A LOT OF
 DEMOCRATIC VOTERS ARE SITTING
 THERE BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW
 THE ALTERNATIVE, BUT THE SOUL OF
 THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS RAPIDLY
 ANTI-TRUMP AND GOING CRAZY LEFT
 AND BELONGS TO OCASIO-CORTEZ.
 THAT IS WISHFUL REPUBLICAN
 THINKING.
 THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
 WE DID IT AS REPUBLICANS.
 ALEX, THERE ARE FOLKS WHO ARE
 SITTING IN IOWA, NEW HAMPSHIRE,
 SOUTH CAROLINA, CALIFORNIA,
 WHICH WAS AN EARLY STATE ON
 SUPER TUESDAY THIS TIME WHO ARE
 WORRIED ABOUT THE EDUCATION OF
 THEIR CHILDREN.
 THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HEALTH
 CARE.
 WHICH IS WHY WARREN IS --
 THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS IN
 WASHINGTON, D.C.
 WE'RE GOING TO MOVE AWAY FROM
 POLITICS.
 LET'S GET BACK TO THIS.
 LET'S GET TO WHAT'S PRACTICAL
 HERE, AND WHAT CAMPAIGNS COME
 DOWN TO ARE CANDIDATES.
 FORGET ABOUT ALL THE IDEOLOGY
 AND EVERYTHING ELSE, IT'S
 CANDIDATES.
 WHO'S GOING TO PERFORM.
 YOU HAVE SEEN THIS, AND I
 HAVE SEEN IT AND I HAVE WILL IT.
 KAMALA HARRIS LEARNED THIS IN
 HER FIRST WEEK WHEN SHE'S
 TALKING ABOUT SMOKING POT
 LISTENING TO TUPAC.
 SHE SAID SHE WAS IN COLLEGE.
 YOU'RE SHAKING YOUR HEAD,
 PATRICK, BUT LET ME TELL YOU.
 SHE HAS PROBABLY TOLD THAT B.S.
 STORY IN CALIFORNIA A THOUSAND
 TIMES AND NO ONE EVER CALLED HER
 ON IT.
 WHEN YOU RUN FOR PRESIDENT, THEY
 CALL YOU ON EVERYTHING AND WHO'S
 GOING TO PERFORM --
 WHETHER THEY TELL THE TRUTH
 NOW?
 THAT'S A NEW STANDARD.
 WHEN THE LIGHTS GO ON -- WHEN
 THE LIGHTS GO ON, THERE IS ONLY
 TWO ALTERNATIVES.
 YOU EITHER SHINE OR YOU MELT.
 THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO
 ALTERNATIVES FOR PRESIDENTIAL
 CANDIDATES AND WE'LL SEE WHO
 DOES WHAT AND IT'S WAY TOO EARLY
 TO TRY TO FIGURE IT OUT WITH
 THESE FOLKS AND WHEN JOE BIDEN
 IS SEEN AS THE FRONT RUNNER
 WHICH I THINK HE IS IF HE GETS
 IN, THIS IS A GUY WHO HAS RUN
 TWICE AND HASN'T EXACTLY SHINED
 BOTH TIMES HE RAN.
 GOVERNOR, YOU KNOW A THING OR
 TWO ABOUT FANCIFUL TALES.
 OH, PATRICK.
 BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,
 THE GOVERNOR IS RIGHT THAT THIS
 REALLY IS ABOUT PERFORMANCE.
 YOU SHOWED THE CLIP AT THE VERY
 BEGINNING, GEORGE.
 EVERY CANDIDATE WITH THE
 EXCEPTION OF AMY KLOBUCHAR
 STARTED EACH SENTENCE WITH I.
 I BELIEVE, I FEEL.
 THEY UNDERSTAND AT THE END OF
 THE DAY, IT'S WHETHER PEOPLE CAN
 TRUST THEIR VALUE AND THEIR
 STORY.
 SINCE THE GOVERNMENT
 SHUTDOWN, THE PRESIDENT HAS HAD
 SOMET
 SOMETHING OF A COMEBACK
 RECENTLY.
 HEADING TOWARDS THE MID 40s, AND
 NOT THERE YET, BUT THIS
 EMERGENCY WILL BE FRONT AND
 CENTER ON CAPITOL HILL THIS
 WEEK.
 RIGHT.
 EXACTLY.
 THE PRESIDENT THINKS THIS IS A
 GOOD RE-ELECTION.
 SOMETHING THAT HE CAN RUN ON AND
 THAT'S GOING TO HELP HIM AND,
 YOU KNOW, IT SHOWS THAT HE IS
 OBVIOUSLY CATERING TO HIS BASE
 AND SHE'S SHOWING HE'S PUTTING
 THEM FRONT AND CENTER, BUT IN
 GOING TO THAT, HE HAS SORT OF
 UPENDED THE RE-ELECTIONS
 POTENTIALLY OF OTHER SENATE
 REPUBLICANS.
 THEY CONTINUE WANT THIS VOTE.
 THEY DONE, AND A LOT OF THEM
 WERE PRIVATELY TELLING THE
 PRESIDENT, PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.
 DON'T DO THIS.
 THIS IS GOING TO CREATE A
 TERRIBLE PRECEDENT.
 IF WE HAVE A PRESIDENT BERNIE
 SANDERS SOMEDAY, IF HE'S GOING
 TO DO SOMETHING WITH THE GREEN
 NEW DEAL ON HIS OWN, AND CALL
 THIS AN EMERGENCY, WE CAN'T HAVE
 THAT.
 WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF THOSE SAME
 REPUBLICANS WHO PRIVATELY WERE
 TELLING HIM, DON'T DO THIS, COME
 OUT AND SAY THAT THEY'RE NOT
 GOING TO PUSH BACK AGAINST HIM.
 STILL HIS REPUBLICAN PARTY
 AND BY THE WAY, IF THE ELECTION
 WERE HELD TODAY AGAINST THE
 DEMOCRATIC PARTY HE'S RUNNING
 AGAINST, I THINK DONALD TRUMP
 WILL WIN BY MORE THAN HE WON
 LAST TIME.
 THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS GOING
 CRAZY LEFT.
 THE ONLY THING THAT HAS
 CHANGED -- NEITHER PARTY HAS
 CHANGED.
 REPUBLICANS NOR DEPARTMENTS AS
 PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ELECTED AND
 NOW HE'S NOT THEORY, BUT HE'S
 FACT.
 THE MIDTERM ELECTION --
 EXCUSE ME.
 THE APROEP OCCAPROPRIATION O
 FACT.
 LET'S NOT FORGET THAT HAPPENED.
 WOMEN IN PARTICULAR?
 THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO
 UNDERSTAND.
 MIDTERMS ARE A REFERENDUM ON THE
 INCUMBENT.
 PRESIDENTIAL YEARS ARE CHOICES
 AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE OFFERING A
 CHOICE OF GOING LEFT.
 TRUMP IS SAYING --
 DEMOCRATIC CHOICE IS NOT --
 THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE A PRIMARY
 CONTEST, ALEX.
 TRUMP'S CHOICE IS CLEAR.
 GROWTH AND LOCKING THE DOORS AT
 NIGHT AND SECURITY.
 THE DEMOCRATS' RESPONSE HAS NOT
 BEEN ABOUT EITHER OF THEM.
 IT'S BEEN ABOUT THE MOMMY BEAR
 PARTY CARING AND NOURISHING,
 LIKE A 1950s SITCOM.
 SO HEALTH CARE -- HEALTH
 CARE, CHILD CARE AND --
 I'M NOT ADVOCATING.
 I'M JUST TELLING YOU.
 TRUMP HAS A STRONG HAND GOING
 INTO 2020.
 YOU THINK THE ECONOMY IN A
 YEAR IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE THE
 ECONOMY TODAY, YOU'RE WRONG, AND
 THE TAX REFUND ISSUE IS REAL.
 I KNOW THIS.
 I MEAN, YOU'RE GOING TO SAY
 WHILE THE TAXES WERE REDUCED,
 PEOPLE COUNT ON THAT WE FUND AND
 THEY FEEL THEY GOT SHORTCHANGED
 AND THEY LOOK AT ECONOMIC AND
 BUSINESS INVESTMENT THAT NEVER
 MATERIALIZED.
 THEY PACKAGED THIS SIGNATURE
 PIECE FOR THIS PRESIDENT.
 IT'S NOT A GREAT POLITICAL
 STRATEGY.
 AND I'M NOT HOPING FOR BAD
 NEWS, BUT I THINK BAD NEWS IS
 PREDICTABLE IN THIS CYCLE.
 I MEAN, I'M NOT THE ONLY PERSON
 SAYING THIS.
 I THINK -- LOOK AT --
 IT'S SOCIALISTS.
 IN THE ECONOMY, IT'S
 AGRICULTURE.
 WE HAVE RECORD BANKRUPTCY.
 ALEX IS COUNTING ON THAT
 SOCIALISM LABEL STICKING, BUT
 CHRIS, I WANT TO BRING UP A
 DIFFERENT POINT INSIDE THE
 REPUBLICAN PARTY.
 IT SEEMS TO BE TRUMP'S
 REPUBLICAN PARTY RIGHT NOW.
 YOU HAD BILL WELD SAYING HE'S
 GOING TO RUN AGAINST HIM.
 LARRY HOGE SAID THIS.
 I WAS JUST SWORN IN A MONTH
 AGO FOR MY SECOND TERM, AND I
 HAVE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO
 HERE IN MARYLAND.
 I'M BEING APPROACHED FROM A LOT
 OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND I GUESS
 THE BEST WAY TO PUT IT IS I
 HAVEN'T THROWN THEM OUT OF MY
 OFFICE.
 HOW REAL IS THIS IDEA OF THE
 SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE TO THE
 PRESIDENT?
 NOT REAL.
 THERE IS PROBABLY NOBODY IN
 AMERICAN POLITICS WHO KNOWS
 LA
 LARRY HOGAN BETTER THAN I DID
 BECAUSE I WENT IN THERE WHEN NO
 ONE THOUGHT MARYLAND WAS
 WINNABLE AND I INVESTED
 $2 MILLION IN HIM AND WE GOT HIM
 OVER THE FINISH LINE.
 HE WON BOTH TIMES.
 ONLY THE SECOND REPUBLICAN EVER
 TO BE RE-ELECTED GOVERNOR OF
 MARYLAND IN THE HISTORY OF THE
 STATE BECAUSE HE'S A SMART
 POLITICIAN, AND A SMART
 POLITICIAN IS NOT BASED ON THIS
 SET OF FACTS TO CHALLENGE DONALD
 TRUMP IN A PRIMARY BECAUSE THESE
 GUYS HAVE 80% APPROVAL RATINGS
 AMONG REPUBLICANS.
 WHAT LARRY IS DOING IS HE HAS
 ISSUES HE CARES ABOUT AND HE'S
 GOING TO USE IT AS A PLATFORM TO
 SPEAK OUT ABOUT THE ISSUES TO
 BRING THE PARTY BACK TOWARDS
 WHERE HE IS, BUT THE IDEA THAT
 LARRY HOGAN -- BILL WELD ISN'T
 SERIOUS AND NO ONE TAKES HIM
 SERIOUSLY, BUT LARRY HOGAN -- MY
 THEORY IS HE WON'T DO IT.
 IT'S POLITICAL SUICIDE TO DO
 THAT RIGHT NOW.
 THIS IS DONALD TRUMP'S PARTY
 STILL.
 TWO YEARS LATER.
 LOOK NO FURTHER AGAIN TO THE
 NATIONAL EMERGENCY.
 IT COMES OUT AS AN
 INVESTIGATION.
 LARRY HOGAN WILL BE WITH A
 WHOLE GROUP OF PEOPLE RUNNING.
 THIS IS THE EMERGENCY
 DECLARATION FOR WEEKS.
 HE IGNORED THEM AND THEY'RE
 BACKING OFF, AND THIS IS TRUMP'S
 PARTY.
 WHAT DOES HAPPEN WITH THESE
 FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATIONS?
 WE HAVEN'T SEEN ROBERT MUELLER'S
 REPORT.
 AND DO YOU SENSE ANY CONCERN
 AMONG YOUR COLLEAGUES THAT IF
 ROBERT MUELLER FINISHES HIS JOB
 AND HANDS IT OFF IF THEY'RE
 GOING TO BE WARY OF GOING TOO
 FAR?
 I HOPE SO.
 I THINK THEY ARE.
 I THINK THEY REALIZE THAT ONE OF
 THE WORST THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN
 IN MY OPINION IS IMPEACHMENT.
 I THINK THAT YOU HAVE TO WIN AT
 THE BALLOT BOX IN ORDER TO HAVE
 A -- HAVE A REAL FUTURE FOR THIS
 COUNTRY.
 DOES THAT MEAN NO OFIN
 INVESTIGATING?
 NO BUT IT MEANS WHAT DO YOU
 DO WITH THAT INVESTIGATION?
 ALL OF THAT INFORMATION IS
 CRITICAL AND IMPORTANT AND THE
 PUBLIC NEEDS TO KNOW.
 20% OF THE PUBLIC BELIEVES
 WHATEVER THE PRESIDENT SAYS.
 THE NEXT 20% WILL SAY, YEAH.
 HE DOESN'T ALWAYS TELL THE
 TRUTH.
 SO WHAT?
 YOU HAVE 40% SO WON'T CARE.
 YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE 20% THAT
 YOU HOPE YOU CAN PERPERSUADE.
 THE PAST IS PROLOGUE.
 THE YEAR BEFORE PRESIDENT NIXON
 RESIGNED, 57% OF MEAMERICANS SA
 TOO MUCH ATTENTION WAS BEING
 PAID TO WATERGATE.
 ARE YOU FULL SPEED AHEAD?
 DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS ARE
 ABSOLUTELY GOING TO CONTINUE
 THESE INVESTIGATIONS.
 THERE'S MORE THAN ENOUGH FODDER
 WHEN YOU CONSIDER EVERY
 INSTITUTION THAT DONALD TRUMP
 HAS TOUCHED, HAS COME INTO BEING
 QUESTIONED FROM HIS CABINET
 PICKS LIKE HIS CURRENT LABOR
 SECRETARY TO HIS FOUNDATION THAT
 HE HAD TO SHUTTER.
 HERE'S THE THING THOUGH.
 THERE BETTER BE SOME THERE
 THERE.
 IF THEY'RE GOING TO DECIDE TO GO
 DOWN THAT ROAD -- PATRICK.
 PATRICK, THIS IS A DIFFERENT
 CONTEXT NOW BECAUSE WHEN YOU ARE
 GET STING INTO A PRESIDENTIAL
 ELECTION CYCLE, PEOPLE SEE IT AS
 NOT BEING NECESSARILY
 LEGITIMATE, BUT BEING POLITICAL.
 EVEN MORE POLITICAL WHEN YOU
 HAVE THESE CANDIDATES THAT
 THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO
 CONTROL THEMSELVES.
 HOW DOES THAT AFFECT YOUR
 COLLEAGUES IN THE SOUTHERN
 DISTRICT THAT SEEM TO HAVE THE
 SERIOUS --
 NOT A LICK.
 NOT A BIT.
 THEY DON'T CARE.
 WHEN I WAS U.S. ATTORNEY IN NEW
 JERSEY, EVERYONE USED TO REFER
 TO THEM AS THE SOVEREIGN
 DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
 THEY BELIEVED THEY ARE SOVEREIGN
 AND THEY LISTEN TO NO ONE.
 THEY BARELY LISTEN TO THE
 ATTORNEY GENERAL.
 THEY WILL DO WHATEVER THEY THINK
 THEY NEED TO DO, AND THAT'S WHAT
 I HAVE BEEN SAYING AS YOU KNOW,
 FOR TEN MONTHS HERE.
 THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW
 YORK INVESTIGATION IS MON
 MONUMENTALLY MORE PERILOUS THAN
 BOB MUELLER EVER WAS OR WILL BE.
 THEY HAVE TWO TOUR GUIDES AND NO
 RESTRICTION ON WHERE THEY CAN
 GO.
 THAT IS THE LAST WORD.
 UP NEXT, WHAT TO EXPECT FROM
 PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SECOND NUCLEAR
 SUMMIT WITH NORTH KOREA'S KIM
 JONG-UN.
 WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
 GET RID OF ALL OF THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPONS?
 THEY WILL.
 I THINK THEY WILL.
 I REALLY BELIEVE THAT HE WILL.
 I HAVE GOTTEN TO --
 DID HE TELL YOU THAT?
 YEAH, SURE.
 DE-NUKING.
 HE'S DE-NUKING THE WHOLE PLACE
 AND HE'S GOING TO START VERY
 QUICKLY.
 I THINK HE'S GOING TO START NOW.
 I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SEE
 ULTIMATELY DE-NUCLEARIZATION OF
 NORTH KOREA.
 I THINK WE WILL SEE THAT
 ULTIMATELY.
 I HAVE NO PRESSING TIME
 SCHEDULE.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
 EXPECTATIONS.
 THAT'S SET FOR THURSDAY IN
 VIETNAM.
 LET'S TALK ABOUT THE RISK AND
 THE POSSIBLE REWARDS WITH OUR
 PANEL OF EXPERTS, TOM BOSSERT,
 FORMER TRUMP HOMELAND SECURITY
 ADVISER, A FORMER CIA ANALYST,
 AND THE FORMER AMBASSADOR TO THE
 U.N.
 LET ME BEGIN WITH YOU.
 YOU SAW THE PRESIDENT SETTING
 THE KPAPEXPECTATIONS.
 IT'S A QUESTION MARK QUESTIONING
 WHETHER THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
 IS IT A -- CAN YOU HAVE A
 SUCCESSFUL SUMMIT WITHOUT A
 CLEAR COMMITMENT BY THE NORTH
 KOREANS, AN ACTUAL CONCRETE
 ACTION TO DENUCLEARIZE?
 I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE
 SUCCESSFUL UNLESS YOU HAVE
 COOPERATION WITH MISSILES,
 NUCLEAR DETONATIONS.
 IT SEEMS THE PRESIDENT IS
 DEFLATING EXPECTATIONS, AND
 THAT'S OF CONCERN.
 THE CONCERN -- BECAUSE I THINK
 WHAT SHOULD COME OUT OF THIS
 SUMMIT IS A FRAMEWORK FOR
 NEGOTIATIONS.
 MY WORRY, GEORGE, IS THIS
 NEGOTIATION, THIS SUMMIT MAY BE
 A DUD, THAT INSTEAD OF CONCRETE
 PROGRESS ON WHAT IS IMPORTANT,
 DE-NUCLEARIZATION, AND IT'S NOW
 SHIFTING FROM DE-NUCLEARIZATION
 ARMS CONTROL TO PEACE.
 SO IMPORTANT STEPS.
 RETURN OF OUR SERVICEMEN, THE
 REMAINS.
 MAYBE A LIAISON OFFICE, MAYBE
 SOME KIND OF CONTINUED
 NORTH/SOUTH COOPERATION WHICH IS
 GOOD.
 I THINK THE PRESIDENT DESERVES
 CREDIT FOR LOWERING TENSIONS IN
 THE REGION, BUT IN TERMS OF
 CONCRETE ACCOMPLISHMENTS, I
 DON'T THINK THIS SUMMIT IS GOING
 TO PRODUCE THAT.
 THE DUD IS ONE POSSIBILITY,
 AND THERE HAS BEEN SOME CONCERN
 FROM THE PRESIDENT'S ADVISERS HE
 GIVES SOMETHING HE SHOULDN'T
 GIVE AWAY TOO SOON SAYING A
 FORMAL PEACE DECLARATION DECLAR
 WAR.
 THERE HAS BEEN A PROFOUND
 SHIFT IN TALKING ABOUT PEACE,
 AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY
 PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE THE POINT OF
 A SUMMIT BETWEEN THE TWO LEADERS
 IS TO GET DISMANTLEMENT AND
 NORTH KOREA TO COMPLETELY
 ABANDON ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
 I THINK HAVING A PEACE
 DECLARATION AND NORMALIZATION IS
 FINE FOR TENSION REDUCTION, BUT
 WE HAVE TO WONDER ABOUT HOW THAT
 AFFECTS NORTH KOREA'S ACTIONS
 DOWN THE LINE.
 SHOULD THERE BE A SUMMIT NOW
 GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE
 PRESIDENT'S OWN NATIONAL
 SECURITY JOHN BOLTON SAYS --
 THERE HAS BEEN BACK PEDALING
 AND DISHONESTY FROM THE LAST
 SUMMIT WHICH IS A WATER SHED
 MOMENT UNTIL TODAY, AND AT THIS
 POINT, THE ONLY REASON TO HAVE
 THAT SUMMIT IS FOR PRESIDENT
 TRUMP TO GO IN AND GIVE A CLEAR
 RE
 REMINDER.
 IT WILL BE A DUD IF HE TRIES TO
 VARNISH THIS AS A SUCCESS
 WITHOUT ANY AXCACTIONABLE ACTIV.
 ANY GESTURE ON THE PART OF THE
 NORTH KOREANS WILL BE A SLAP IN
 THE FACE, BUT IF THE PRESIDENT
 COMES OUT AND BUYS IT WHETHER
 IT'S POLITICAL PRESSURE OR ON
 INSTINCT TO POST A WIN, HE'S
 GOING TO LOSE THE INTERNATIONAL
 COALITION HE PUTS TOGETHER.
 THE PRESIDENT HAS PUT THIS
 OUT HE SAID THAT NORTH KOREA CAN
 BE AN ECONOMIC POWERHOUSE UNDER
 KIM I DON'TJONG-UN IF THEY JUSTP
 NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
 ALMOST TRYING TO INCENTIVIZE
 HIM.
 HE'S BANKING ON HIS PERSONAL
 RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM AND HOW IT
 WILL YIELD BENEFITS.
 I THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP IS
 MAKING THE MISTAKE OF MIRROR
 IMAGING.
 THE PRESIDENT IS FROM NEW YORK
 CITY.
 HE'S A BUSINESSMAN AND A REAL
 ESTATE MOGUL AND HE IS SPEAKING
 IN TERMS OF AS IF KIM IS ANOTHER
 BUSINESSMAN, BUT KIM IS A
 DICTATOR AND A HIGHLY
 AUTHORITARIAN REGIME AND HE
 NEEDS HIS WEAPONS FOR SURVIVAL.
 NORTH KOREA IS IN THE MIDDLE OF
 A VERY STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT
 AMONG THE SECOND, THIRD AND 11th
 LARGEST ECONOMIES IN THE WORLD,
 BUT NORTH KOREA SEES ITS
 LOCATION AND ITS ECONOMIC DEP
 VAGS RELATIVE AS A THREAT TO ITS
 SURVIVAL.
 HOW DO WE MAKE PROGRESS SHORT
 OF NORTH KOREA GETTING RID OF
 ITS WEAPONS?
 WHAT KIND OF CONCRETE ACTION
 COULD WE SEE FROM NORTH KOREA
 THAT WOULD REALLY SIGNIFY REAL
 PROGRESS THAT CAN BE BUILT ON?
 I THINK JOHN IS RIGHT AND SO
 IS TOM.
 I HAVE CALLED THIS A POTENTIAL
 DUD, BUT WE HAVE GOT TO CONTINUE
 TALKING.
 THE RELATIONSHIP --
 NO HARM IN IT.
 NO.
 THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE TWO
 LEADERS, THAT'S GOOD.
 HOWEVER, THE PRESIDENT SHOULD
 LISTEN TO HIS ADVISERS AND HIS
 ADVISERS HAVE BEEN I THINK VERY
 SPECIFIC.
 WHAT I FEAR WE'RE GOING TO LOSE,
 ONE, A DETAILING OF ALL THE
 WEAPONS INVENTORY THAT NORTH
 KOREA HAS.
 I THINK WE HAVE KIND OF GIVEN UP
 ON THAT.
 SECONDLY, THAT WE SIMPLY SAY,
 OKAY.
 YOU DISMANTLE THE REACTOR,
 ANOTHER MISSILE SITE THAT THEY
 HAVE ALREADY DONE SEVERAL TIMES.
 THAT'S A DANGER, AND IF THAT'S
 THE ONLY ARMS CONTROL INITIAL
 INITIATIVE THAT THEY PUSH, AND I
 THINK LASTLY, MY WORRY, GEORGE,
 IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO TRADE
 SOMETHING WITH THE NORTH KOREANS
 REALLY WANT, WHICH IS A PEACE
 TREATY, IN EXCHANGE FOR SOME
 LIMITED ARMS CONTROL MEASURES.
 WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IS
 DISMANTLE SOME WEAPONS.
 THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DISMANTLE
 ALL OF THEN.
 FREEZE INTERCONTINENTAL
 BALLISTIC MISSILES THAT AFFECT
 JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA.
 FIND WAYS THAT THESE ARE
 CONCRETE STEPS.
 TIME LINES, VERIFICATION,
 FRAMEWORK FOR NEGOTIATIONS.
 IF IT'S JUST A BUNCH OF, YOU
 KNOW, HANDSHAKES AND YOU'RE A
 GOOD GUY AND WE'LL MEET AGAIN,
 IT'S GOING TO BE A DUD.
 IS THERE A WIN/WIN HERE?
 YEAH, BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO
 HAPPEN OUT OF THIS MEETING.
 SO WHAT HAPPENED IN THE LAST
 MEETING TOOK US BACK FROM THE
 BRINK OF WAR, BUT THE
 PRESIDENT -- TWO PRESIDENTS
 AGREED TO TWO MUTUALLY
 INCONSISTENT FUTURE OBJECTIVES.
 ONE WAS NORMALIZATION BETWEEN
 THE NORTH AND SOUTH AND WONE WA
 DE-NUCLEARIZATION OF THE NORTH.
 PRESIDENT MOON IN THE SOUTH IS
 OPENING SANCTIONS AND INDUSTRIAL
 COMPLEXES IN THE NORTH TO INDUCE
 THEM INTO FURTHER TALKS AND THAT
 WOULD FUNDAMENTALLY UNDERMINE
 EVERYTHING THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP
 IS TRYING TO DO WITH RESPECT TO
 DENUCL
 DENUCLEARIZING.
 IF YOU DON'T FORCE HIM, THE
 NORTH WILL NOT GET RID OF THEIR
 WEAPONS.
 THE WIN/WIN HAS TO BE FOR THE
 PRESIDENT TO CARRY THE
 INTERNATIONAL GOOD WILL.
 HE'S NOT REPRESENTING THE UNITED
 STATES, AND NOT COME OUT WITH
 THREATENING SANCTIONS.
 THAT'S THE LAST WORD.
 THAT IS ALL FOR US TODAY.
 THANK YOU FOR SHARING PART OF
 YOUR SUNDAY WITH US.
 CHECK OUT "WORLD NEWS TONIGHT"
 AND I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW ON
 "GMA."
