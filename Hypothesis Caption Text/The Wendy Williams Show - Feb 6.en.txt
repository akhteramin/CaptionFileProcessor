 Announcer: LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY, IT'S
 "THE WENDY WILLIAMS SHOW."

 NOW, HERE'S NICK CANNON! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

 Nick: WHAT'S UP, Y'ALL?
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 HOW YOU DOIN'?
 Audience: HOW YOU DOIN'?
 Nick: YOU KNOW WHAT?
 [LAUGHS]
 I'VE GOT TO SAY, Y'ALL WAS RIGH
 RIGHT.
 EVERY DAY, I'VE BEEN SUPER
 ENERGETIC, SCREAMING AT THE TOP
 OF MY LUNGS, AND A PLAYER DONE
 LOST HIS VOICE.
 [AUDIENCE REACTS]
 BUT I DID NOT LOSE MY ENERGY!
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 IT'S SO GOOD TO BE HERE WITH THE
 FAMILY.
 FAMILY, WHERE WE AT?
 Audience: WE LOVE THAT!
 Nick: THAT'S WHAT I'M
 TALKING ABOUT.
 I LOVE Y'ALL, I LOVE BEING HERE.
 IT AIN'T GOING TO STOP.
 THIS UNFORTUNATELY IS MY LAST
 DAY.
 [AUDIENCE REACTS]
 BUT I'VE GOT TO GO GET MY MOVIE
 STAR ON, Y'ALL!
 I'M MAKING AN ACTION MOVIE IN
 DUBAI!
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 TRÈS LOOK LIKE A MOVIE STAR?
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 GO AHEAD, GET THE WHOLE OUTFIT.
 I LOOK LIKE A RINGLEADER RIGHT
 NOW.
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 BUT YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO HAVE
 SOME MORE GREAT GUEST HOSTS
 UNTIL THE QUEEN RETURNS, MISS
 WENDY!
 [APPLAUSE]
 I'M GOING TO BE WATCHING FROM
 DUBAI.
 Y'ALL JUST KEEP THE ENERGY
 GOING.
 WITHOUT FURTHER ADO, I GUESS NOW
 I'M GOING TO HAVE TO DRINK SOME
 TEA WHILE I'M TALKING ABOUT THE
 TEA!
 IT'S "HOT TOPICS," Y'ALL!
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

 YEAH!
 I LOVE IT.

 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 IT IS TIME.
 SIT ON DOWN, RELAX.
 WE ABOUT TO GET IN EVERYBODY'S
 BUSINESS RIGHT NOW.
 HOW HAVE Y'ALL BEEN ENJOYING THE
 "HOT TOPICS"?
 THEY'VE BEEN GOOD?
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 I TRIED TO KEEP IT REAL THOUGH.
 I DON'T LIKE TO BE NASTY.
 I HAVE NO MALICIOUS INTENT OR
 ANY OF THAT, BUT I'VE GOT TO BE
 HONEST, Y'ALL.
 THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WANT, RIGHT
 CUSTOMER YOU WANT TO HEAR THE
 REAL
 TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT TWO THINGS THAT I'VE BEEN
 AVOIDING TALKING ABOUT, BUT I'VE
 GOT TO TALK ABOUT IT.
 ONE THING, WE'RE JUST GOING TO
 GET RIGHT TO IT.
 MY HIT SHOW, SEASON 13, "WILD N'
 OUT" ."
 [AUDIENCE CHANTING]
 BUT, GUESS WHO'S ON THIS WEEK?
 BOW WOW AND -I HAVE BEEN
 REALLY TRYING TO AVOID TALKING
 ABOUT THIS ALL WEEK BECAUSE
 THESE TWO BEAUTIFUL INDIVIDUALS
 ARE MY PERSONAL FRIENDS.
 AND COLLEAGUES.
 I HAVE KNOWN BOW OUT SINCE HE
 WAS A LITTLE PUP.
 [LAUGHTER]
 KIYOMI IS A "WILD N' OUT" GIRL.
 THERE'S US HANGING OUT BACKSTAGE
 AFTER THE SHOW.
 THAT'S ME AND KIYOMI, MOMENTS
 EARLIER.
 IT'S UNFORTUNATE AND IT'S SAD,
 BECAUSE THEY WERE ARRESTED OVER
 THE WEEKEND AFTER GETTING INTO A
 PHYSICAL FIGHT.
 I'M JUST SAYING, THERE IS
 NOTHING FUNNY ABOUT
 DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WHATSOEVER ON
 EITHER SIDE.
 YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
 THERE SHOULD BE NO DOUBLE
 STANDARD EITHER WAY.
 I REACHED OUT, KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
 TO BOTH OF THEM.
 BECAUSE IT'S A REAL LEGAL
 MATTER, THEY'VE GOT TO GO TO
 COURT AND STUFF.
 NEITHER ONE OF THEM ACTUALLY
 WANTED TO SPEAK ON THE ACTUAL
 EVENTS THAT HAPPENED, BECAUSE
 THEY HAVE BEEN ADVISED -I
 SPOKE TO KIYOMI.
 BOW WOW STILL AUNT CALLED ME.
 HE SUPPOSED TO BE MY FRIEND!
 HE'S SENDING ME SENDING        D
 ALL THAT.
 YOU AIN'T GETTING NO CHRISTMAS
 PRESENT THIS YEAR!
 [LAUGHTER]
 YOU'RE GOING TO GET A STATEMENT!
 THIS IS MY MAN.
 I'VE KNOWN HIM FOREVER, AND WE
 ALWAYS HAVE FUN.
 AS A MATTER OF FACT, TAKE A LOOK
 AT THIS WEEK'S CLIP FROM
 "WILD N' OUT" TO SEE HOW WE PLAY
 WITH EACH OTHER.
 YO.
 I SAW YOUR PAYCHECK FOR YOUR
 SHOW.
 YOU KNOW IT AIN'T REAL.
 COME WORK FOR ME.
 YOU KNOW WE GET THAT BREAD FOR
 REAL.
 SIGNED THAT DEAL.
 NO, DON'T YOU REACH!
 SEAT DON'T ASK THAT YOUR
 BLACK -DOWN AND WATCH THE
 TEACHER TEACH!
 Nick: HE SEEMED A LITTLE
 AGGRESSIVE!
 [APPLAUSE]
 RIGHT?
 WHERE WAS ALL THAT THIS WEEKEND?
 THIS IS WHERE I'VE GOT TO STICK
 UP FOR BOTH OF MY FRIENDS.
 BECAUSE IT'S A LITTLE -THE
 RUMORS IS CRAZY OUT THERE RIGHT
 NOW.
 I DID SOME INTEL AND SOME
 RESEARCH.
 THERE IS A RUMOR OUT THERE THAT
 THE FIGHT WAS OVER KIYOMI
 FLIRTING WITH SHAQUILLE O'NEAL.
 [AUDIENCE REACTS]
 KIYOMI MUST NOT HAVE A TYPE AT
 ALL, RIGHT?
 [LAUGHTER]
 LOOK AT THE SIZE DIFFERENCE!
 I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
 IT WOULD TAKE TWO BY WHILES AND
 ONE KEVIN HART TO EQUAL THAT.
 I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
 I DON'T REALLY NO, AND REALLY,
 IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS WHAT
 THE ALTERCATION WAS ABOUT.
 BUT THERE IS A BUNCH OF
 DIFFERENT STORIES GOING ON.
 I HAVE TO ASK Y'ALL, FAMILY DOES
 YOU GOT TO HELP ME OUT WITH
 THIS.
 WHEN YOU HAVE TWO FRIENDS -I'M
 PRESENT BOTH OF THEM -AND I
 DON'T WANT TO TAKE SIDES.
 THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS MATTER.
 I WANT TO TALK TO BOTH OF THEM.
 I DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO TALK ABOUT
 IT ON THE SHOW.
 I GET IT, BUT THE MAN IN ME
 WANTS TO INSTANTLY PROTECT THE
 WOMAN.
 KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
 I BELIEVE NOBODY SHOULD PUT
 THEIR HANDS ON A WOMAN
 REGARDLESS.
 I TELL MY SON ALL THE TIME,
 "NEVER PUT YOUR HANDS ON A
 WOMAN."
 I DON'T CARE WHAT THE SITUATION
 IS.
 [APPLAUSE]
 THERE IS NO REASON.
 BUT THE REFEREE IN ME...
 [LAUGHTER]
 LOOK, I'M CONCERNED FOR BOW WOW!
 WE NEED SOME JUSTICE FOR BOW WO
 WOW!
 THIS HAS BEEN A HOT TOPIC I'VE
 BEEN TRYING TO AVOID, BUT I LIKE
 TO TALK ABOUT THE NOT TOPICS,
 TOO.
 THE THING WE ARE NOT TALKING
 ABOUT IS THAT NOBODY SHOULD BE
 PUTTING THEIR HANDS ON ANYONE,
 REGARDLESS OF GENDER.
 [APPLAUSE]
 WHEN YOU'VE GOT TO GO ALL THE
 WAY TO VIOLENCE FOR WHATEVER
 REASON, I JUST CAN'T CONDONE
 THAT.
 I DON'T WANT TO BE PREACHY OR
 NONE OF THAT, BUT Y'ALL GOING TO
 HAVE TO START MEDITATING OR
 SOMETHING.
 GIVE IT TO JESUS.
 [APPLAUSE]
 BECAUSE BOW OUT -BOY, WE GOING
 TO HAVE TO START A FUND FOR BOW
 OUT.
 GET A LITTLE BOW WHILE SHOULDER
 FOR BRUISED BROTHERS OR
 SOMETHING.
 [LAUGHTER]
 BOW WOW, CALL ME.
 KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
 I WISH HIM THE BEST.
 I TOLD YOU, DON'T MESS WITH THEM
 "WILD N' OUT" GIRLS.
 THEY DO DRESS!
 I GOT THEM FROM THE ISLAND WHERE
 WONDER WOMAN IS FROM!
 I ONLY HIRE POWERFUL QUEENS,
 Y'ALL.
 SPEAKING OF POWERFUL QUEENS,
 ANOTHER THING THAT'S BEEN IN THE
 NEWS -WHICH I FIND PRETTY
 FASCINATING -CHRIS PRATT, WE
 ALL NO, JUST CELEBRATED HIS
 ENGAGEMENT TO
 ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER'S
 DAUGHTER.
 CATHERINE SCHWARZENEGGER.
 BUT WHAT HE CHOSE TO DO -I
 AIN'T MAD AT HIM.
 HE CELEBRATED BY GOING TO A
 STRIP CLUB.
 [AUDIENCE REACTS]
 MY ONLY THING IS, HE WENT BY
 HIMSELF.
 HE DIDN'T BRING HIS FIANCEE WITH
 HIM.
 WHY DOES SHE GET LEFT OUT OF THE
 FUN?
 IT IN A JOKING WAY, THIS IS
 WHERE CHRIS MIGHT HAVE TOOK IT A
 LITTLE TOO FAR.
 HE EVEN JOKINGLY SAID TO A
 STRIPPER THERE AT THE STRIP
 CLUB -HE ASKED HER TO MARRY
 HIM INSTEAD.
 [AUDIENCE REACTS]
 I KNEW Y'ALL WASN'T GOING TO
 FEEL THAT.
 I DON'T THINK ARNOLD IS GOING TO
 FEEL THAT, EITHER.
 THE TERMINATOR GON' WHOOP YOUR
 - , CHRIS!
 "YOU DON'T DISRESPECT MY
 DAUGHTER!"
 I GOT YOUR BACK, PLAYER.
 I'VE BEEN IN THE STRIP CLUB,
 TOO, AND THAT BRINGS THEM AFTER
 MONEY OUT OF YOU.
 "I NEED TO PROPOSE TO HER, PAY
 SOME TUITION, SOMETHING!"
 I GET IT.
 IF ARNOLD GOT PROBLEMS WITH IT,
 YOU TELL THEM TO CALL ME.
 YOU CAN HAVE A STRIPPER.
 HE HAD THE MAID, WHAT'S THE
 DIFFERENCE?
 [AUDIENCE REACTS]
 DID I GO TOO FAR?
 Suzanne: NO, I LOVE THAT
 YOU BROUGHT UP MILDRED!
 Nick: I HAD TO BRING UP
 MILDRED!
 SHE PROBABLY BE TWERKING AND
 PUSHING THE BROOM, TOO!
 [AUDIENCE REACTS]
 [LAUGHTER]
 THIS IS THE THING -AGAIN, GET
 TO THE NOT TOPIC REAL QUICK, I
 THINK WE ARE IN SUCH A
 PROGRESSIVE TIME AND A TIME OF
 STRENGTH AND TRUE LIBERATION FOR
 WOMAN
 WOMEN THAT WE SHOULD STOP
 LOOKING DOWN ON STRIP CLUBS.
 THAT'S NOT A BAD THING.
 THEY'RE MAKING MONEY, GETTING
 THROUGH SCHOOL.
 [APPLAUSE]
 I DONE.
 PLENTY TUITION.
 IT'S A RESPECTABLE ENVIRONMENT.
 THEY SHOULD BE HAVING BIBLE
 STUDY IN THE STRIP CLUBS NOW.
 DROPPING IT LOW FOR JESUS.
 I'VE SEEN IT.
 [LAUGHTER]
 I HAVE SEEN IT.
 I'M JOKING AROUND, BUT I
 HONESTLY BELIEVE -WHAT'S THE
 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STRIPPERS AND
 VICTORIA'S SECRET MODELS?
 ONE IS JUST A CASH UPFRONT
 BUSINESS.
 [LAUGHTER]
 I TRULY BELIEVE THAT.
 WE WILL HAVE A WHOLE NIGHT AND
 GLORIFY THESE OTHER WOMEN
 WALKING UP AND DOWN THE RUNWAY
 IN THEIR UNDERWEAR.
 MY SON IS LOOKING AT THE
 MAGAZINE AT THE HOUSE.
 BUT THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE.
 SO I'M NOT GOING TO JUDGE, TO
 ALL THE STRIPPERS, IF YOU NEED
 ME, CALL ME.
 [LAUGHTER]
 [APPLAUSE]
 AND THE VICTORIA'S SECRET
 MODELS, TOO!
 IF Y'ALL NEED ME, CALL ME, TOO.
 I'M AVAILABLE.
 [LAUGHTER]
 AND EVERYTHING REALLY
 INTERESTING IN THE NEWS, AND I'M
 A HUGE FAN.
 I'M PROUD OF THIS BROTHER.
 HE HAS HAD QUITE THE JOURNEY.
 HIS SPIRIT IS SO STRONG.
 DMX WAS RELEASED FROM PRISON.
 [APPLAUSE]
 TWO WEEKS AGO.
 I LOVE IT.
 MAN.
 I LOVE THAT BROTHER RIGHT THERE.
 HE'S BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH, AND
 HAS PREVAILED, OVERCOME SO MANY
 OBSTACLES.
 AND HE JUST ANNOUNCED THAT HE'S
 GOING BACK ONTO HER
 A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE ISSUES WITH THIS.
 A LOT OF FANS ARE SAYING THAT,
 YOU KNOW IT'S TOO SOON AND IT'S
 NOT GOOD FOR HIS SOBRIETY.
 EXACTLY!
 I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.
 DMX OWED THE GOVERNMENT LIKE
 $2 MILLION.
 WHAT ELSE HE GOT TO GET OUT
 THERE AND MAKE IT MONDAY
 CUSTOMER HE'S GOT TO GET A JOB
 [APPLAUSE]
 WHAT OTHER JOB IS DMX GOING TO
 DO?
 YOU WON'T SEE DMX AT
 McDONALD'S.
 "WE'LL COME TO McDONALD'S, HOW
 CAN I TAKE YOUR ORDER?
 WHAT?
 I CAN'T HEAR YOU!"
 HE'S GOING TO A CROSSING GUARD?
 DMX OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL?
 "STOP, DROP, SHUT IT DOWN BEFORE
 YOU GET SHOT!"
 [AUDIENCE SINGING SONG]
 Y'ALL ARE HILARIOUS!
 I WOULD HIRE DMX AS MY
 ACCOUNTANT, THOUGH.
 HE WILL PROTECT THE MONEY, FOR
 REAL.
 "HEY, YO, DOUG.
 YOUR DIVIDENDS, YOU GOT TO GET
 THAT REVENUE.
 [BARK]
 "MY MAN!
 BUT DMX HAS GOT 15 KIDS AND NINE
 BABY MAMAS.
 [AUDIENCE REACTS]
 I SALUTE YOU!
 BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY, THAT'S
 WHAT WE ARE ON THE EARTH FOR.
 THAT'S WHAT JESUS SAID, I THINK.
 YOU MAD THAT HE GOT ALL THEM
 KIDS?
 THAT'S A LEGACY!
 Audience: WOW.
 Nick: SHE SANG "WOW."
 ALL I'M SAYING, THAT MAY NEED TO
 TAKE CARE OF HIS KIDS SO WE CAN
 GET BACK TO WORK DOING WHAT HE
 LOVES AND WHAT WE LOVE HIM FOR.
 [APPLAUSE]
 ONE OF THE GREATEST
 REPRESENTATIVES TO DO IT, AND I
 PRETTY SURE IT IS EXTREMELY
 THERAPEUTIC FOR HIM TO BE UP
 THERE WITH HIS FANS, GETTING
 THAT LOVE, AS HIS HEALING
 PROCESS OCCURS.
 SO WE'RE GOING TO SUPPORT YOU,
 DOG MAN X.
 WE WITH YOU, MAN.
 GET THAT MONEY!
 [BARKING]
 THAT WAS FUNNY.
 HE WAS LIKE "WHAT?"
 I LOVE IT, MAN.
 THAT'S CULTURE RIGHT THERE.
 THIS IS A LITTLE WEIRD BUT,
 AGAIN, I DON'T JUDGE.
 I JUST PUT OUT THERE.
 DID YOU SEE THAT HUGE HARRY
 STYLES FACE TATTOO?
 WE TALKED ABOUT IT.
 SHE PUT IT ON HER FACE.
 THEY TALKED ABOUT ON THE SHOW,
 IT WENT VIRAL.
 WELL, IT TURNS OUT IT WAS FAKE.
 [AUDIENCE REACTS]
 [APPLAUSE]
 SHE FINESSED US, AND I LOVE IT!
 I LOVE THE FINESSE!
 SHE IS ACTUALLY A SINGER.
 KELSEY CARTER ADMITTED IT WAS A
 PUBLICITY STUNT TO PROMOTE HER
 NEW SONG CALLED "HARRY."
 SHE RELEASED THE WHOLE VIDEO
 BECAUSE SHE PUT OUT A SONG.
 SHE WAS SAYING SHE WAS GOING FOR
 IT HER DOG PASSED AWAY, AND SHE
 REVEALS -"I'M A FAN OF
 HARRY STYLES," AND SHE MADE A
 SONG CALLED "HARRY."
 SHE MADE A WHOLE VIRAL VIDEO.
 "HOWEVER OFF THE ENTIRE WORLD
 FOR $300."
 SHE EXPLAINED HOW SHE WOKE UP
 ONE MORNING AND TO GET MORE
 ATTENTION ON HER SONG SHE
 PRETENDED SHE HAD A TATTOO ON
 HER FACE.
 I SALUTE YOU!
 [APPLAUSE]
 THE NOT TOPIC HERE IS THE THINGS
 THAT WE DO AS PEOPLE IN A
 SOCIETY TO GET ATTENTION AND
 SOCIAL MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT.
 I'M GUILTY.
 [LAUGHTER]
 I GOT A TATTOO OF A POP STAR,
 WELL.
 [AUDIENCE REACTS]
 BUT MINE WAS REAL!
 I COULDN'T JUST WASH THAT OFF
 WITH NO DOVE SOAP!
 [LAUGHTER]
 THAT WAS LEFT, RIGHT THERE,
 THOUGH.
 PEOPLE ASKED ME, "WHY DID YOU DO
 IT?"
 WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO BUY MARIAH
 CAREY?
 ATE A ROCK BIG ENOUGH TO PROVE
 MY LOVE!
 SO I WAS LIKE, "BABY, I'M GOING
 TO PUT YOUR NAME ON MY BACK."
 AND SHE STILL GOT MY BACK TO
 THIS DAY!
 WE ARE THE CLOSEST OF FRIENDS.
 WE ARE RAISING SOME AMAZING KIDS
 TO GIVE.
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 JUST BECAUSE -I ADDED TO IT,
 OF COURSE.
 BECAUSE I HAD TO ADD SOME MORE.
 THAT'S MY KIDS, ANGELS, THAT'S
 JESUS.
 IT'S A WHOLE FAMILY.
 THE HOLY SPIRIT IS COVERING UP
 "MARIAH."
 BUT IT'S STILL THERE!
 IT'S LIKE A COLLAGE.
 I'VE GOT SOME MORE ROOM, TOO!
 MY LEGS IS FREE.
 I TOLD Y'ALL, I'M GOING TO PUT
 HALLE BERRY AND NAOMI RIGHT
 HERE.
 I WILL GET RIHANNA RIGHT HERE.
 IT'LL ALL WORK OUT.
 ARE Y'ALL TATTOO PEOPLE?
 I CAN'T BLAME ANYBODY, BECAUSE
 I'M TATTED UP.
 WHO'S GOT TATS IN HERE?
 [APPLAUSE]
 WOULD YOU EVER GET A SIGNIFICANT
 OTHER TATTOOED ON YOU?
 Audience: NO!
 Nick: SO I'M THE ONLY FOOL
 IN THE BUILDING PRAY [LAUGHTER]
 I DO IT AGAIN.
 I DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN.
 THAT'S WHAT LOVE IS ABOUT.
 [APPLAUSE]
 THE YOUNG GIRL, THE " "CASH ME
 OUSSIDE" GROUP.
 I AIN'T MAD AT HER.
 TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT SHE'S DOING
 NOW.
 I'M A BAD KID THAT MY MOM
 CAN'T CONTROL PART I WENT FROM
 SLEEPING ON THE FLOOR IN A
 TRAILER TO HAVING A GOLD RECORD
 IN SIX MONTHS.
 I'VE GOT TO GO UP MANAGERS A
 BODYGUARD.
 MY MOM -THEY THINK I'M YOUR
 BABY.
 THEY DON'T WANT ME TO GO UP TO
 HIM BUT TIME.
 SHE'S A LITTLE [BLEEP]
 [BLEEP].
 SHE'S NEVER HAD A FATHER IN
 HER LIFE.
 SHE'S BECOME LIKE MY TEAM HQ.
 I GIVE UP EVERYTHING FOR YOU!
 WHAT DID YOU GIVE UP?
 Y'ALL REALLY WANT TO KNOW
 WHAT'S GOING ON?
 I'M HERE TO [BLEEP] TELL YOU!
 Nick: SUZANNE, I'M NOT MAD
 AT THIS!
 YOU DON'T LIKE THIS?
 I KNOW YOU ARE A MOM.
 Suzanne: YOUNG GIRLS ARE
 LOOKING UP TO THIS AND I DON'T
 APPROVE OF THAT.
 Nick: YOU MAY NOT AGREE
 WITH THIS, BUT I WANT TO KEEP IT
 REAL.
 I WOULD RATHER MY DAUGHTER BE
 GOING THIS DIRECTION THAN THE
 KYLIE JENNER DIRECTION.
 THAT JUST ME.
 THIS GIRL MAY HAVE A BAD MOUTH,
 SHE NEED SOME GUIDANCE, SHE
 NEEDS A WHOOPING.
 BUT AT THE SAME AGE, KYLIE
 JENNER WAS GETTING
 PLASTIC SURGERY.
 SHE GOT A MAKEUP LINE, SHE'S
 GOTTA MAKE UP LINE.
 THEY ARE BOTH MAKING MONEY OFF
 OF SOCIETY'S EXPECTATION OF
 YOUNG GIRLS.
 THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT WAYS.
 BUT IF I HAVE TO CHOOSE, I WANT
 MY DAUGHTER TO GET OUT THERE AND
 BE ALLOWED MOUTH AND TALK.
 BECAUSE THEN I CAN SAY IS ABOUT
 DISCIPLINE AND RESPECT.
 BUT WHEN HE GETS THAT OF THE
 WORLD WHERE THERE ARE THINGS
 THAT I CAN'T CONTROL, BECAUSE
 SOCIAL MEDIA IS CONTROLLING
 EVERYTHING -AS A PARENT, I'M
 JUST SAYING, SUZANNE...
 IF I HAD TO CHOOSE.
 BECAUSE I CAN FIX BAD BHABIE
 WITH A BAD BHELT.
 [LAUGHTER]
 [APPLAUSE]
 I'LL GIVE YOU A PERFECT EXAMPLE.
 A LOT OF PEOPLE GOT MAD AT ME ON
 SOCIAL MEDIA BECAUSE I LET MY
 KIDS -WE BE CUTTING UP WHEN WE
 GET TOGETHER.
 WE DO "YO MAMA" JOKES AND OF
 ITSELF.
 BUT IT'S FUN!
 NOT THEY MAMA.
 BUT WE DO "YO MAMA" JOKES PRAYED
 I WILL TALK ABOUT MY SON,
 MOROCCAN.
 THIS IS MY SON WITH HIS JOKE.
 SPEAK OKAY.
 WHAT WAS THAT?
 OH, YEAH.
 YO MAMA SO STUPID, SHE PUT AN
 iPAD IN THE BLENDER TO MAKE
 APPLE JUICE!
 [LAUGHTER]
 Nick: STUPID MAMA!
 YOU KNOW EIGHT NO DOUBLE
 STANDARDS.
 IT'S EQUAL, WE DON'T JUST DO
 MAMA JOKES.
 WE DO DIRTY JOKES, TOO.
 LOOK AT MY DAUGHTER, MUNRO.
 GO AHEAD AND SHOW THAT ONE.
 ALBRIGHT, MUNRO.
 WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT MAMA'S.
 WHAT ABOUT DADDY'S?
 SPEAK OKAY.
 YOUR DADDY IS SO OLD, WHEN THEY
 SAID "LET THERE BE LIGHT," HE
 WAS THERE TO FLICK ON THE LIGHT
 SWITCH.
 [LAUGHTER]
 [APPLAUSE]
 THAT'S FUNNY!
 AND PEOPLE SAY, "YOU SHOULDN'T
 HAVE THEM," THEY UNDERSTAND.
 THEY'RE EMPOWERED, THEY KNOW THE
 JOKE IN THE END THE DIFFERENCE
 BETWEEN HUMOR AND BEING REAL.
 THEY RESPECT ME AS A PARENT.
 ONE THING IN MY HOUSE, I WANT
 THEM TO SPEAK FREELY INTO
 EVERYTHING THEY WANT TO DO
 BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEIR
 PARENTS DO.
 BUT I WANT TO FOCUS ON
 EDUCATION.
 [APPLAUSE]
 IT STARTS SUPER YOUNG.
 THEY'RE SO MUCH GOING ON A
 SOCIETY, I WANT TO INFORM THEM
 AND EMPOWER THEM SO I'M NOT
 HIDING ANYTHING FROM THEM.
 SO THE CLOSER -I STARTED THEM
 AS BABIES, Y'ALL.
 MY 7-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER WAS
 TUTORING MY ONE AND A
 HALF-YEAR-OLD.
 CHECK THIS OUTCOME IS EDUCATION.
 THIS IS AMAZING TO ME.
 WHAT DOES THIS SAY?
 POLAR BEAR.
 WHAT DOES THIS SAY?
 WAVE.
 WHAT DOES THIS SAY?
 GOOD JOB, MAN!
 Nick: HE'S NOT EVEN TWO YET
 YET!
 IT'S ABOUT EMPOWERING YOUR YOUNG
 PEOPLE.
 EDUCATE THEM.
 IT'S A TOUGH WORLD OUT THERE.
 I DON'T WANT TO JUDGE ANYBODY,
 BECAUSE PARENTING IS A DIFFICULT
 THING.
 I DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS.
 JUST INFORM THEM AND GIVE THEM
 UNCONDITIONAL LOVE.
 THAT'S WHERE IT IS.
 [APPLAUSE]
 'S GOT MORE GREAT SHOW!
 UP NEXT, RAPPER AND ACTIVIST, MY
 BROTHER, KILLER MIKE IS HERE,
 Y'ALL!
 SO GRAB A SNACK AND COME ON
 BACK!
 A [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 Nick: WELCOME BACK, WELCOME
 BACK!
 STILL TRYING TO GET MY VOICE
 BACK.
 I'M NURSING IT WITH THIS TEA.
 Y'ALL GOT ME DOING DMX
 IMPRESSIONS AND STUFF.
 I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE A VOICE
 WHEN I GET TO DUBAI!
 RIGHT NOW I'M SUPER EXCITED
 BECAUSE I'M BRINGING OUT
 SOMEBODY NOT ONLY WHO I ADMIRE,
 WHO I'M A FAN OF, BUT I CONSIDER
 A BROTHER.
 OUR FIRST GUEST IS A
 GRAMMY-NOMINATED RAPPER AND
 SOCIAL ACTIVIST.
 AND FELLOW OUTSPOKEN VOICE IN
 THE COMMUNITY, IN THE STRUGGLE.
 HIS NEW SHOW ON NETFLIX IS
 CALLED "TRIGGER WARNING WITH
 KILLER MIKE."
 TAKE A LOOK.
 I'M TRYING TO INTRODUCE
 PEOPLE TO NEW CONCEPTS.
 KILLER MIKE!

 I WANT TO KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT
 IS TO TRULY LIVE IN THE BLACK
 ECONOMY.
 NO RACISM, BUT YOU ARE ASIAN AND
 I'M ONLY SPENDING MONEY IN THE
 BLOOD COMMITTEE FOR THE NEXT
 THREE DAYS.
 YOU AIN'T BLACK.
 I COULD GO BUY T-SHIRT.
 THIS FEELS A LITTLE BIT MORE
 CORPORATE.
 YEAH.
 I HAVEN'T WORKED WITH A GANG
 BEFORE.
 THIS IS THE FIRST TIME FOR
 EVERYTHING.
 Nick: HILARIOUS AND
 INFORMATIVE!
 PLEASE WELCOME, MICHAEL RENDER.
 AK, KILLER MIKE!
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

 Nick: NOW, THE BROTHER
 RIGHT HERE ISRAEL WITH IT.
 ONE OF THE HOTTEST RAPPERS IN
 THE GAME.
 COMING OUT OF ATLANTA.
 [APPLAUSE]
 WE'VE GOT TO BREAK DOWN A LITTLE
 BIT.
 YOU'RE GOING TO SCARE SOME OF
 THE FOLKS.
 I SAY KILLER MIKE, THEY'RE LIKE,
 "KILLER MIKE?
 COULD HE BE MORE LIKE FRIENDLY
 MY?"
 Mike: MY NAME IS MICHAEL
 RENDER.
 I'M NAMED FOR MY DAD AND I HAVE
 A DAUGHTER NAMED FOR ME.
 ACTUALLY WON A GRAMMY A LOT OF
 YEARS AGO.
 [APPLAUSE]
 WE LOST LAST YEAR, THOUGH.
 I'M ONE HALF OF THE GROUP CALLED
 RUN THE JEWELS, AND I'M A
 BEAUTIFUL WOMAN NAMED SHAYNA'S
 HUSBAND.
 THANK Y'ALL FOR HAVING ME.
 Nick: THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL
 THING!
 THE KILLER CAME FROM KILLING
 THEM IN BATTLES, RIGHT?
 Mike: I WAS 15 YEARS WILL
 PREVAIL AND FIVE, SIX, SEVEN,
 EIGHT GUYS.
 I WAS KILLING THEM.
 MY NICKNAME WAS SKUNK.
 I GOT STOOD UP AND SAID, "YO,
 THAT KID IS A KILLER, HE'S
 KILLING Y'ALL."
 AND NOBODY CALLED ME MIKE AFTER
 THAT.
 Nick: KEEP KILLING IT, MAN.
 YOU'RE KILLING IT OUT THERE
 RIGHT NOW.
 Mike: I APPRECIATE YOU,
 MAN.
 YOUR FAN, BROTHER.
 JUST IN TERMS OF BEING
 OUTSPOKEN.
 Nick: THAT'S LOVE.
 Mike: I APPRECIATE.
 Nick: I'VE GOT TO GET YOU
 ON THE PODCAST SO WE CAN GET
 REAL DEEP!
 ONE OF THE THINGS I ADMIRE AND
 RESPECT ABOUT YOU EVERY TIME WE
 GET TOGETHER, YOU ARE OUR
 FAMILY-ORIENTED MEN PREVIEW OF
 YOUR COMMUNITY COMMUNITY.
 YOU'VE BEEN MARRIED FOR     TO E
 OR 13 YEARS.
 [APPLAUSE]
 THAT'S SUCCESS RIGHT THERE!
 YOU GOT YOUR QUEEN WITH YOU.
 Mike: SHE HATES THAT
 PICTURE.
 I THINK SHE LOOKS HOT.
 [APPLAUSE]
 SHE'S PROBABLY GOING TO HATE ME
 LATER FOR THAT PHOTO BEING USED,
 BUT I TOLD HER THAT SHE IS
 BAYWATCH BEAUTIFUL.
 [AUDIENCE REACTS]
 Nick: THERE IT IS!
 SHE'S ALSO EXTREMELY POWERFUL,
 EXTREMELY INTELLIGENT.
 YOU ACTUALLY WANTED TO MAKE A
 PURCHASE, A CAR PURCHASE.
 THE DODGE DEMON, WHICH IS A LOT
 OF MONEY.
 SHE SHIPPED ON THE PURCHASE AND
 TOLD YOU TO INVEST?
 Mike: THERE WERE TWO
 THINGS.
 I WANTED A DODGE DEMON.
 I SAVED UP FOR LIKE A YEAR, I
 WAS GOING GET ONE.
 AND MY GOOD FRIEND T.I. CALLED
 ME AND SAID THAT THERE IS A
 RESTAURANT FOR SALE IN OUR
 NEIGHBORHOOD CALLED BANKHEAD
 SEAFOOD.
 AND I SAID, "OH, WELL, I GUESS
 IT WILL BE GETTING THAT DEMON."
 LATER, I WAS LIKE, "I'VE GOT A
 QUARTER MILLION DOLLARS, ALL MY
 FRIENDS ARE BUYING ROLLS-ROYCE
 TRUCKS.
 MAYBE I SHOULD, TOO."
 AND SHE WAS LIKE, "NO, DUMMY.
 WE'RE GOING TO BUY AN APARTMENT
 BUILDING."
 Nick: A WISE WOMAN.
 Mike: THE BUILDING WE
 BOUGHT IS WORTH TRIPLE WHAT IT
 WAS WORTH WHEN WE BOUGHT IT.
 [APPLAUSE]
 WITH A QUARTER MILLION DOLLAR
 INVESTMENT, SHE MAY BE ABOUT
 500,000 EXTRA DOLLARS.
 Nick: WOW.
 THAT'S A QUEEN RIGHT THERE!
 THAT'S BEING EQUALLY YOKED!
 Mike: AND SHE'S SHAVED BIG
 ON IG.
 Nick: FOLLOW THE GREEN.
 NOT ONLY DO YOU HAVE APARTMENT
 BUILDINGS, RESTAURANTS, YOU HAVE
 A LOT OF PROPERTY AND BUSINESSES
 IN YOUR COMMUNITY IN GEORGIA.
 AND THE SUPER BOWL THIS PAST
 WEEKEND WAS THERE.
 EVERYBODY KNOWS, I TOOK THE
 STANCE.
 IF IT'S ME AND KAEP, I WAS WITH
 HIM FOR REAL.
 WE HAD CHINESE VEGAN FOOD.
 I CHOSE TO STAY HERE.
 I CAME BACK TO GET READY FOR THE
 SHOW.
 Mike: THEY MISSED YOU.
 I WAS LIKE, "SORRY, GIRLS, WE
 ARE PROTESTING."
 [LAUGHTER]
 Nick: VERY FUNNY.
 WE DON'T SHARE THE EXACT SAME
 OPINION, BUT WE WANT THE SAME
 OUTCOME.
 I WANT TO KNOW HOW YOU FEEL
 ABOUT THE SUPER BOWL COMING TO
 YOUR CITY AND ALL THE THINGS
 THAT WERE GOING ON THERE.
 Mike: FIRST OF ALL, THERE
 ARE MANY ROADS TO FREEDOM.
 WE CAN ALL MEET EACH OTHER THEY
 PAID DURING THE CIVIL RIGHTS
 CAMPAIGN, MARTIN KING WAS LOOKED
 AT AS SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE WHITE
 STRUCTURE HERE.
 IF YOU LOOK AT THOSE BROTHERS,
 MALCOLM, THEY WERE LOOKED AT AS
 MORE RADICAL.
 BUT THEY WANTED THE SAME THING.
 BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS FOR US.
 FOR ME, AND MATTERS OF BLACK
 PEOPLE CHOOSING TO WORK ON THE
 SUPER BOWL, I'VE BEEN HAVING TO
 CRITIQUE, I HAVE CRITICISM,
 BECAUSE I LIVE IN ATLANTA.
 I SAW WHAT IT DID FOR A SECOND
 I'M GOOD.
 BECAUSE OF THERE'S LOT OF BLACK
 BUSINESS OWNERSHIP, IN
 PARTICULAR AFRICAN-AMERICAN
 WOMEN -I SAW RESTAURANTS
 THRIVE.
 EVEN THE STRIP CLUB I WENT TO
 HIS BLACK-OWNED.
 [APPLAUSE]
 Nick: EXCEPT FOR THE ONE
 ASIAN STRIPPER IN THE SHOW!
 Mike: I SHOWED HER LOVE
 LATER.
 [LAUGHTER]
 YOU CAN'T HAVE A SUPER BOWL IN
 ATLANTA AND NOT HAVE OUTKAST
 PRESENT, SO BIG BOI WAS
 APPROPRIATE.
 YOU CAN DO IT WITHOUT HAVING
 GLADYS KNIGHT PRESENT.
 I DON'T WANT CIVIL RIGHTS TO
 FORCE US TO BE THERE, I DON'T
 WANT THEM WIPED AWAY.
 I WAS PROUD OF ATLANTA BECAUSE
 WE MANAGED TO DISAGREE AND STILL
 BRING INCOME TO THE WORKING
 CLASS PEOPLE.
 THEY WALKED AWAY WITH MORE
 MONEY.
 [APPLAUSE]
 SMALL BUSINESSES WALKED AWAY.
 Nick: I'VE GOT TO SALUTE
 IT.
 Mike: AND WE GOT THE JAM.
 SO I THINK MAROON 5 DESERVES A
 SALUTE FOR WE DID.
 MY GROUP, RUN THE JEWELS, WE
 OPENED UP FOR THE FOO FIGHTERS
 THE DAY BEFORE TOM MORELLO CAME
 OUT AND PLAY.
 SO PEOPLE PROTESTED.
 THERE WAS A MURAL OF
 COLIN KAEPERNICK THAT GOT TORN
 DOWN.
 ARTISTS CAME TOGETHER THE NIGHT
 BEFORE.
 SEVEN.
 Nick: ALL OVER THE CITY OF
 ATLANTA.
 AND COLIN LOVED IT, HE REPOSTED
 ALL OF THEM.
 I FELT LIKE THE NFL HEARD OUR
 VOICE IS LOUD AND CLEAR.
 AND THE RATINGS -IT WAS THE
 LOWEST IN TEN YEARS.
 I THINK WE BOTH GOT WHAT WE
 WANTED OUT OF THIS WHOLE THING.
 [APPLAUSE]
 THESE ARE THE TYPE OF TOPICS
 THAT YOU DISCUSS AND DEAL WITH
 ON YOUR NEW NETFLIX SHOW,
 "TRIGGER WARNING WITH
 KILLER MIKE."
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE STRIP
 CLUB!
 EPISODE -I LOVE ALL THE
 EPISODES I'VE SEEN THUS FAR, BUT
 THE ONE THAT YOU WANTED TO ONLY
 SPEND YOUR MONEY IN THE BLACK
 COMMUNITY -IT WAS SO DIFFICULT
 FOR YOU THAT YOU HAD TO SLEEP ON
 THE BUS BENCH!
 Mike: ON A PARK BENCH IN
 ATHENS!
 Wendy: YOU COULDN'T EAT,
 YOU COULDN'T GET OF THAT --
 [LAUGHTER]
 AT IT SO DIFFICULT BECAUSE THERE
 AREN'T ENOUGH BLACK-OWNED
 BUSINESSES.
 TELLING THEM ABOUT THAT.
 Mike: WHITE PEOPLE TAKE
 MARIJUANA FROM MEXICANS.
 I COULDN'T EVEN SMOKE BECAUSE
 MARIJUANA IS --
 BUT AFTER THAT --
 Nick: YOU COULDN'T FIND NO
 JAMAICANS?
 Mike: I COULDN'T FIND ONE
 JAMAICAN!
 [LAUGHTER]
 THIS IS THE THING.
 INDIVIDUALLY, AS
 AFRICAN-AMERICANS, SEVEN YEARS
 OR TEN YEARS AFTER SLAVERY WE
 HAD ALREADY AMASSED LAND AND
 WEALTH DONE BETTER FOR
 OURSELVES.
 BY THE TIME 1907 CAME AROUND,
 OUR UNIVERSITY WAS GREATER AND
 MORE BLACK REALTORS IN HARVARD
 AND YALE.
 BECAUSE THEY COULD TAKE TRADE.
 TO ME, IT'S ABOUT BEING
 ECONOMICALLY RESPONSIBLE.
 THEN AS A COMMUNITY, DOING THAT.
 THAT HELPS THE LARGER COMMUNITY.
 IF THE BLACK COMMUNITY IN
 AMERICA IS STRONG FINANCIALLY
 AND ECONOMICALLY COME THE
 GREATER COMMUNITY BECOME STRONG.
 HOW DOES THAT WORK?
 WELL, IF YOUR COMMUNITY IS
 CHARGING $2.50 OR $3.50 FOR GAS,
 AND IT'S A CORPORATE, LARGE GAS
 STATION, I DO HAVE A SMALL GAS
 STATION THAT COULD GIVE YOU
 BETTER PRICING -LOCALLY,
 REGIONALLY, OR AS WE SAY, BLACK.
 BECAUSE I LIVE NEAR BLACK
 PEOPLE.
 SEEKING GOING TO MAKE MEDIA TAKE
 ADVANTAGE OF THOSE RESOURCES AND
 JOIN IN.
 OUR COMMUNITY IS STRONG, THE
 GREATER COMMUNITY STARTED.
 I'M NEVER EXCUSING PEOPLE WHEN I
 SAY BLACK OR BY BLACK.
 I WANT TO CODY.
 I WANT VANILLA, CHOCOLATE,
 STRAWBERRY.
 [APPLAUSE]
 Nick: MAN, WHEN ARE YOU
 RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, MAN?
