 ACTOR TARAJI P. HENSON. TARAJI: YOU MIGHT WANT TO SAY
 THAT BEFORE I GO STICKING MY
 FINGER IN THERE.
 REVEALS HER PERSONAL HEALTH
 SCARE.
 TARAJI: I'M PASSED OUT ON THE
 FLOOR.
 AND HER RAPID WEIGHT GAIN
 TURNED OUT TO BE A 50 POUND
 TUMOR.
 DR. OZ: A MASS THAT WEIGHS AS
 MUCH AS A SIX-YEAR-OLD.
 PLUS, DR. PIMPLE POPPER
 WEIGHS IN.
 COMING UP NEXT.

 DR. OZ: ARE YOU READY FOR SEASON

 YEAH!
 I LOVE YOU, DR. OZ.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: TARAJI P. HENSON IS ONE
 OF HOLLYWOOD'S BIGGEST STARS.
 FROM HER HIT TV SHOW EMPIRE TO
 HER NEW FUNNY MOVIE, WHAT MEN
 WANT.
 TARAJI, SHE CAN DO IT ALL.
 RECENTLY, TARAJI OPENED UP ABOUT
 A HEALTH SCARE THAT CAUSED HER
 TO MAKE BIG CHANGES TO SAVE HER
 LIFE.
 SHE IS HEALTHY, SHE IS HAPPY,
 AND SHE IS HERE.
 TARAJI, COME ON OUT.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: I TELL YOU -THEY LOVE
 YOU.
 TARAJI: THANK YOU.
 THANK YOU.
 HI!
 [LAUGHTER]
 DR. OZ: I DON'T GET THAT KIND OF
 APPLAUSE.
 TARAJI: YES YOU DO.
 DR. OZ: I'M SO HAPPY YOU ARE
 HERE.
 TARAJI: THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
 DR. OZ: WE WERE AT THE WOMEN'S
 FINALS OF THE U.S. OPEN,
 EXPERIENCING ONE OF THOSE MOMENT
 IN U.S. HISTORY, SERENA WILLIAMS
 AND NAOMI OSAKA IN AN
 UNFORGETTABLE MATCH.
 TARAJI: WE WERE THERE FOR THE
 BIG MOMENT.
 DR. OZ: WE WERE STARING AT EACH
 OTHER, TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF
 WHAT WAS HAPPENING.
 WHAT MEN WANT IS A NEW MOVIE
 THAT EVERYBODY IS GOING TO LOVE.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: JUSSIE SMOLLETT, WHO HAS
 BEEN ON THE SHOW, WAS RECENTLY
 INJURED.
 IT IS BEING CALLED A HATE CRIME.
 I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE BEEN ABLE
 TO SPEAK TO HIM.
 TARAJI: YOU KNEW I HAD TO CHECK
 ON MY BABY.
 DR. OZ: CASTMATE FROM EMPIRE AND
 GOOD FRIEND.
 TARAJI: HE IS RESILIENT AND HIS
 MOTHER RAISED HIM RIGHT.
 HE IS AT HIS VERY CORE, HE IS
 LOVE.
 THAT IS WHO HE IS.
 [APPLAUSE]
 TARAJI: LOVE IS ALWAYS GOING TO
 WIN.
 THE DEVIL TRIED, BUT NOT THIS
 TIME.
 DR. OZ: ALL OF US ARE SAYING, WE
 LOVE YOU VERY MUCH.
 [APPLAUSE]
 TARAJI: YES, THANK YOU.
 DR. OZ: I ADORE YOU FOR A LOT OF
 REASONS.
 I THINK IT IS PROBABLY WHY A LOT
 OF PEOPLE LIKE YOU.
 YOU ARE REAL AND AUTHENTIC.
 YOU'VE HAD TWO HEALTH ISSUES IN
 YOUR LIFE THAT WE ARE GOING TO
 DISCUSS TODAY.
 THE FIRST HAS TO DO WITH YOUR
 STOMACH.
 TARAJI: DR. OZ: YES.
 YOU HAD A RECENT WARNING FROM A
 DR. ABOUT STOMACH CANCER.
 TARAJI: I WAS FILMING A MOVIE I
 DID CALLED BEST OF ENEMIES WITH
 SAM ROCKWELL.
 I GOT REALLY SICK ONSET AND I
 COULDN'T HOLD WATER DOWN.
 IT HAPPENED ONCE BEFORE WHEN I
 WAS IN MONTE CARLO.
 I WAS STUCK IN A HOSPITAL AND
 THEY ARE SPEAKING FRENCH AND I'M
 SICK.
 I THINK I'M DYING AND NO ONE
 UNDERSTANDS WHAT I'M SAYING.
 ANYWAY, I'M IN GEORGIA AND I
 HAVE THIS BOUT OF THROWING UP.
 I COULDN'T HOLD DOWN WATER.
 NEXT THING YOU KNOW, I'M PASSED
 OUT ON THE FLOOR.
 WE GO TO THE HOSPITAL.
 LONG STORY SHORT, IT IS BAD
 GASTRITIS.
 THE DOCTOR SAID TO ME, IF I
 DON'T CHANGE MY WAYS, I WAS
 GOING TO GET STOMACH ULCERS,
 WHICH WOULD LEAD TO STOMACH
 CANCER.
 I WAS LIKE, YOU HAVE MY
 ATTENTION.
 SO IT WAS DUE TO DRINKING COFFEE
 FOR SO MANY YEARS, SO MANY
 WARNINGS -FROM COLLEGE, THAT
 WAS JUST HAVE IT.
 THEN I USED TO GET REALLY BAD
 CRAMPS ON MY CYCLE.
 SO I WOULD TAKE IBUPROFEN.
 ANY MODEL OF IBUPROFEN, IT SAYS
 DO NOT TAKE ON AN EMPTY STOMACH.
 THAT, WITH THE COFFEE, WINE ALL
 OF THAT WAS EATING THROUGH MY
 STOMACH.
 I HAD TO CUT ALL OF THAT.
 I DON'T DRINK COFFEE ANYMORE.
 DR. OZ: AT ALL?
 TARAJI: I HAVE TO BE REALLY
 TIRED.
 I HAVE OTHER ALTERNATIVES.
 DR. OZ: CAN I SHOW YOU WHAT WAS
 HAPPENING INSIDE YOUR BODY?
 TARAJI: CAN YOU, PLEASE?
 ONCE I SAW IT FOR MYSELF, THAT
 IS WHEN I WAS LIKE, I HAVE TO
 MAKE A CHANGE.
 DR. OZ: I BROUGHT YOU A PRESENT.
 TARAJI: I ALWAYS WANTED TO DO
 THIS.
 DR. OZ: YOU HAVE TO PUT THE
 PURPLE GLOVES ON.
 IF YOU REALLY SEE WHAT IT LOOKS
 LIKE INSIDE, IT WILL REINFORCE
 SOME OF THESE DECISIONS.
 ARE YOU READY, EVERYBODY?
 THIS IS WHAT A HEALTHY STOMACH
 LOOKS LIKE.
 THE SWALLOWING TUBE COMES IN
 HERE.
 THERE'S A BIG MUSCLE HERE THAT
 REGULATES HOW MUCH OF THIS ACID
 GOES TO THE REST OF YOUR BODY.
 PUT YOUR FINGER INTO THAT HOLE.
 FEEL HOW TYPE THAT IS.
 DR. OZ: TARAJI: IS THIS A REAL
 STOMACH?
 DR. OZ: THAT IS A REAL STOMACH.
 [LAUGHTER]
 TARAJI: OK.
 YOU MIGHT WANT TO SAY THAT
 BEFORE I GO STICKING MY FINGER
 IN THERE.
 DR. OZ: WE GOT THESE FROM THE
 MEDICAL SCHOOL.
 TARAJI: I AM ON DR. OZ.
 DUH.
 [LAUGHTER]
 DR. OZ: I WANT YOU TO FEEL HOW
 HARD THESE ARE.
 PUSH THROUGH THAT IF YOU CAN.
 TARAJI: I TRUST YOU.
 DR. OZ: SOME OF THE THINGS WE
 EAT MESS WITH THAT.
 THESE ARE STRONG MUSCLES.
 I CAN HOLD IT LIKE THIS.
 THAT IS HOW TIGHT THAT IS.
 IT IS DESIGNED TO PROTECT US SO
 WE DON'T HAVE THE ACID GOING IN
 THE WRONG PLACE.
 YOU DON'T WANT IT GOING WHERE IT
 IS NOT SUPPOSED TO GO.
 INSIDE THE STOMACH, THERE'S THE
 INSIDE.
 CAN YOU ALL SEE THAT?
 JUST FEEL THE OUTSIDE.
 TARAJI: IT LOOKS LIKE A
 CHANNELING.
 NO THANK YOU.
 DR. OZ: YOU SEE THESE FOLDS.
 THEY ARE NORMAL.
 WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DON'T TAKE
 CARE OF YOURSELF IS THIS.
 TARAJI: OOH!
 THAT IS REAL.
 DR. OZ: WHAT IF I SAID IT WASN'T
 REAL?
 TARAJI: SOMETHING ABOUT THAT
 FELT TOO REAL.
 THAT IS WHY I THOUGHT I WOULD
 ASK.
 DR. OZ: THE THING ABOUT SEEING
 THE REAL BODY IS YOU CAN
 APPRECIATE HOW SIGRID YOUR BODY
 IS.
 IF YOU RECOGNIZE HOW REMARKABLE
 THIS IS, YOU SEE HOW THIS IS A
 VERY DIFFERENT APPEARANCE.
 THIS STOMACH IS THE STOMACH OF
 SOMEONE WHO MADE SOME MISTAKES.
 THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF
 FOLDS AND LAYERING.
 YOU SEE THIS LITTLE THING HERE.
 I DO WANT YOU TO FEEL THAT.
 TARAJI: ARE THOSE ULCERS?
 DR. OZ: KICKSTART IT AS ONE,
 PROBABLY, BUT THIS IS WHAT
 CANCER LOOKS LIKE.
 SEE HOW IT IS INVADING THE
 TISSUE?
 SHOW PEOPLE WHAT YOUR HANDS LOOK
 LIKE.
 TARAJI: YOU SENT ME UP.
 DR. OZ: IT IS REAL.
 IT IS A DR.'S SHOW.
 TARAJI: IT DAWNED ON ME AFTER A
 WHILE.
 DR. OZ: HER HANDS ARE LIKE THIS.
 SO THESE FOLDS ARE VERY
 DIFFERENT.
 IF YOU CAN PREVENT THIS FROM
 HAPPENING, YOU WILL DO THAT.
 TARAJI: SO THE GREEN IS THE
 CANCER.
 DR. OZ: ACTUALLY, THIS IS THE
 CANCER.
 THE INSIDE OF THE CANCER WILL
 SOMETIMES DEVELOP AN ULCER
 ITSELF.
 TARAJI: DON'T DRINK COFFEE ON AN
 EMPTY STOMACH, AMONG OTHER
 THINGS.
 DR. OZ: I THINK YOU ARE ABOUT AS
 SQUEAMISH AS ANYONE HAS BEEN UP
 HERE.
 I'M TAKING TARAJI TO THE
 OPERATING ROOM NEXT TIME.
 HAVE YOU SEEN AN OPERATION?
 TARAJI: I DON'T WANT TO.
 MY STEPFATHER IS A DENTIST.
 HE ALWAYS WATCHES THOSE SURGERY
 SHOWS.
 JUST LIKE WITH POPCORN AND
 PEANUTS, SOMEBODY'S BODY IS OPEN
 AND BLOOD IS EVERYWHERE AND HE'S
 WATCHING IT.
 THAT IS WHY I'M AN ACTRESS.
 [LAUGHTER]
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: SO YOU MENTIONED YOU
 GAVE UP COFFEE.
 ALCOHOL?
 TARAJI: I DON'T DRINK HARD
 ALCOHOL.
 I JUST CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE.
 I GO TO SLEEP.
 I STILL LIKE WINE.
 I JUST DON'T DRINK IT AS
 CASUALLY AS I DID.
 DR. OZ: AND FATTY FOODS ARE A
 PROBLEM.
 TARAJI: BECAUSE I DON'T THINK WE
 HAVE ENOUGH TO BREAK IT DOWN,
 RIGHT?
 I KNOW A LITTLE SOMETHING.
 DR. OZ: SHE KNOWS.
 WHAT DO YOU EAT NOW?
 TARAJI: I EAT VEGAN,
 PLANT-BASED.
 THE CHICKPEA IS MY FRIEND.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: ARE YOU VEGAN?
 TARAJI: I'M TOTALLY VEGAN.
 DR. OZ: THAT IS TOUGH TO DO.
 TARAJI: I DON'T DO ANY DAIRY,
 CHEESE.
 IF I DO MILK, I HAVE A NUT MILK
 MAKER.
 I DRINK A LOT OF ALMOND MILK.
 DR. OZ: I'M SO IMPRESSED.
 [APPLAUSE]
 TARAJI: YOU DO WHAT YOU'VE GOT
 TO DO IF YOU WANT TO LIVE.
 DR. OZ: AND YOUR FIANCE, IS HE
 INTO THIS?
 TARAJI: HE'S MORE OF A GASKET
 AREA, BUT HE STILL LIKES
 CHICKEN.
 [APPLAUSE]
 TARAJI: THEY KNOW.
 HE LIKES THE SAUCE -ANYBODY OF
 CARIBBEAN DISSENT?
 SOUS.
 IT IS A SOUP FROM THE CARIBBEAN,
 RIGHT?
 WHEN WE WENT TO TURKS AND CAICOS
 ON VACATION, WE HAD SOME.
 I LEARNED HOW TO MAKE IT.
 I WILL MAKE HIM THAT AND I WILL
 MAKE ME A VEGAN VERSION WITH
 MUSHROOMS.
 DR. OZ: DO YOU FEEL DIFFERENT?
 TARAJI: I HAVE A LOT MORE
 ENERGY, FOR SURE.
 DR. OZ: WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK

 Who said olive oil is the only heart-healthy cooking oil?
 Mazola corn oil has more cholesterol-blocking
 plant sterols than olive oil.
 And a clinical study showed it can help
 lower cholesterol 2X more.
 When it comes to heart-health, Mazola is a smart choice.

        -Ah, the old crew!
  Remember when we all used to go         to the cafeteria
    and just chow down midday?
      -You mean, like, lunch?
          -Come on. Voted    "Most Likely to Help People

     And that provides energy           that lasts.
 [APPLAUSE] DR. OZ: WE ARE BACK WITH TARAJI
 P HENSON.
 CAN I ASK YOU ABOUT THE WORK
 YOU'VE DONE AROUND MENTAL
 HEALTH?
 THE STIGMA AROUND MENTAL HEALTH
 IS REALLY HURTING THIS COUNTRY.
 NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE SPEAK OUT
 ABOUT IT.
 WHAT GOT THIS ISSUE ON YOUR
 RADAR?
 TARAJI: IT IS IMPORTANT TO ME
 BECAUSE, ACTUALLY I FOUND MY
 FOUNDATION, NAMED AFTER MY
 FATHER, OUT OF NECESSITY.
 THERE HE IS.
 HI, DADDY.
 I MISS YOU.
 I SUFFERED TRAUMA IN MY LIFE AND
 SO DID MY SON.
 WHEN IT CAME TIME TO TALK ABOUT
 IT, IT BECAME AN ISSUE.
 YOU HAVE TO BE CULTURALLY
 COMPETENT IN ORDER FOR ME TO
 FEEL SAFE SHARING MY DEEPEST
 SECRETS AND FEARS AND BEING
 VULNERABLE.
 WHEN IT CAME TIME TO LOOK FOR A
 THERAPIST, THERE WERE NONE.
 IT WAS LIKE LOOKING FOR A
 UNICORN.
 I'M NOT SAYING THEY DON'T EXIST,
 BUT IT WASN'T EASILY ACCESSIBLE.
 I DISCUSSED IT WITH MY BEST
 FRIEND WHO ALSO HAD HER BOUTS
 WITH ANXIETY.
 WE DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT
 IT.
 IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN
 COMMUNITY, IT HAS BEEN SUCH A
 TABOO.
 WE DON'T TAKE CARE OF OUR MENTAL
 HEALTH AND WE SHOULD.
 WE SUPPRESS A LOT.
 IT COMES OFF, AND WHEN WE DO
 EXPRESS OURSELVES, IT COMES OFF
 AS RAGE.
 WE HAVE A LOT TO BE UPSET ABOUT.
 [APPLAUSE]
 TARAJI: AND NOT TO SHUN THOSE
 FEELINGS, BUT THEY NEED TO BE
 CHANNELED OR EXPRESSED IN A
 HEALTHY WAY.
 WE CAN TALK ABOUT OUR THYROID.
 I CAN TALK ABOUT MY GASTRITIS.
 BUT WHEN IT COMES TO OUR MENTAL,
 WHICH IS PART OF TOTAL HEALTH
 CARE, WE MISS THAT.
 FOR SO LONG, WE'VE BEEN TOLD TO
 PRAY OUR PROBLEMS AWAY.
 WE'VE BEEN DEMONIZED.
 WE'VE BEEN MISDIAGNOSED.
 THERE'S A LOT OF TRUST ISSUES.
 I DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT
 IT.
 THE MISCONCEPTIONS WITH
 CELEBRITIES AND PEOPLE YOU LOOK
 UP TO IS THAT, SOMEHOW WE GOT IT
 ALL TOGETHER BECAUSE WE HAVE
 MONEY.
 MONEY DOESN'T MAKE YOUR ISSUES
 GO AWAY.
 WHEN I TAKE THIS WIG OFF AND
 THESE LASHES -HE LOOKED AT MY
 HAIR LIKE, THAT IS A WIG?
 WHEN TARAJI IN THE LIMELIGHT
 COMES OFF, I GO HOME TO REAL
 PROBLEMS JUST LIKE EVERYBODY
 ELSE.
 DR. OZ: WHY DID YOU NAME IT
 AFTER YOUR DAD?
 TARAJI: MY DAD WAS A VIETNAM VET
 AND HE SUFFERED FROM HIS OWN
 ISSUES.
 HE WAS VOCAL ABOUT IT.
 IT MADE AN IMPRESSION ON ME.
 I WOULD HANG OUT WITH MY WHITE
 FRIENDS AND THEY WOULD BE LIKE,
 I HAVE MY APPOINTMENT WITH MY
 THERAPIST.
 I WAS LIKE, I NEED ONE.
 I NEED ONE OF THOSE.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: THAT IS SO IMPORTANT.
 I ALWAYS WONDER, WHY ARE WE ALL
 COMPLETELY PARALYZED BY FEAR,
 ANXIETY, ALL THE STUFF THAT
 HAPPENS?
 HOW DOES THAT AFFECT YOU?
 TARAJI: I THINK I HAD TO DEAL
 WITH A LOT OF MY THINGS WHEN I'M
 PREPARING TO PORTRAY A
 CHARACTER.
 IF I'M LYING TO THE GIRL IN THE
 MIRROR, HOW CAN I TELL THIS
 CHARACTER CINCO TRUTH?
 ACTING TO ME HAS BECOME VERY
 THERAPEUTIC.
 NOT TO SAY I DON'T NEED A
 THERAPIST, BUT I'M JUST VERY
 AWARE OF WHO I AM BECAUSE THIS
 IS MY INSTRUMENT.
 SO I HAVE TO BE.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: I RESPECT YOUR HONESTY
 ABOUT THIS.
 I SEE THAT ACTING IS THERAPEUTIC
 FOR YOU.
 WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN THE
 AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY FOR
 FOLKS TO EMBRACE THIS MORE?
 TARAJI: WE NEED TO START TALKING
 ABOUT IT MORE.
 JUST BY ME LAUNCHING AND GOING
 PUBLIC WITH MY FOUNDATION, I'M
 STARTING TO SEE CHATTER AND
 PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT IT BECAUSE
 YOU PUT A FACE TO IT.
 MY FANS, YOU GUYS TRUST ME,
 RIGHT?
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: THEY DO.
 TARAJI: AND WHEN YOU SEE SOMEONE
 THAT YOU TRUST AND LOOK UP TO
 SAY, IT'S OK, THEN IT MAKES IT
 LIKE A SIGH OF RELIEF, LIKE I'M
 NOT THE ONLY ONE.
 DR. OZ: YOU ARE RIGHT.
 WE ASK OUR AUDIENCE -THE
 REASON WE DO THESE SURVEYS IS TO
 FIND OUT WHAT IS BOTHERING
 AMERICA.
 THE BIGGEST EPIDEMIC IS
 LONELINESS.
 PEOPLE DON'T FEEL CONNECTED.
 THEY DON'T HAVE THE USUAL
 TACTICS LIKE TALKING TO YOUR MOM
 OR BEST FRIEND.
 WHAT IS A TACTIC YOU USED TO GET
 PAST IT?
 TARAJI: I MAKE SURE I KEEP IN
 TOUCH WITH MY FRIENDS.
 I HAVE SUCH A GREAT CORE OF
 FRIENDS THAT CHECK ON ME.
 IT IS ALL ABOUT THE PEOPLE YOU
 HAVE AROUND YOU.
 GET OFF THE INTERNET.
 GET OFF THE SOCIAL MEDIA.
 RECONNECT.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: YOU ARE A BEAUTIFUL
 PERSON.
 ON THE OUTSIDE AND ON THE
 INSIDE.
 TARAJI: THANK YOU.
 DR. OZ: COMING UP, YOU KNOW WHAT
 MEN WANT.
 WHAT AM I THINKING RIGHT NOW?
 WE ARE ABOUT TO FIND OUT.
 STICK AROUND.

  Do you push through migraine?
     Mom, are you OK to play?
 Yeah honey, how about we play...
      princess and pirates?
   Imagine what you can do with   more migraine-free days.
             Arr!
            En garde!
     When you're not fighting     through migraine
    imagine the possibilities.
  Once-monthly Emgality is used  for the prevention
      of migraine in adults.
  It's specifically developed to  help give you
     more migraine-free days.
  With Emgality about 60% of  people had their migraine days
       cut in half or more.
 Do not use if you are allergic to Emgality or its ingredients.
   Emgality may cause allergic   reactions, such as
     itching, rash, hives and     trouble breathing,
 which can happen days after use.
 Call your doctor or get medical help right away
    if you have symptoms of an    allergic reaction.
       The most common side       effects include
    injection site reactions.
   What should we do tomorrow?
 Ask your doctor about Emgality.

 I FEEL WEIRD AFTER LAST NIGHT.
 THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
 TEQUILA MEANS DESPERATION.
 STOP DOING THAT.
 STOP DOING WHAT?
 TALKING WITHOUT MOVING YOUR
 MOUTH AND SAYING THINGS YOU
 SHOULDN'T BE SAYING TO YOUR
 BOSS.
 I WOULD NEVER SAY ANYTHING
 DISRESPECTFUL OR INAPPROPRIATE
 TO YOU.
 RIGHT THERE, YOU JUST DID IT.
 I HEARD YOU SAY IT.
 CAN YOU HEAR MY INNER
 THOUGHTS?
 I CAN HEAR YOUR INNER
 THOUGHTS!
 STOP DOING THAT!
 [LAUGHTER]
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: THAT IS A SCENE FROM
 TARAJI P. HENSON'S HILARIOUS NEW
 MOVIE, WHAT MEN WANT.
 IT IS FUNNY.
 IT IS ACTUALLY ROMANTIC.
 THE IDEA THAT YOU COULD READ OUR
 MINDS, A TAKEOFF FROM WOMEN,
 BECAUSE I WISH WE COULD READ
 YOUR MINDS AS WELL, BUT WHAT
 DOES THE MOVIE MEAN TO YOU?
 TARAJI: FOR ME IT IS A
 CELEBRATION OF JUST BEING
 YOURSELF.
 THAT IS THE THE WE MISS.
 IF YOU ARE HONEST FROM THE
 BEGINNING AND YOU PUT IT ALL ON
 THE TABLE, IT IS NOT THAT
 COMPLICATED.
 IT REALLY ISN'T.
 [APPLAUSE]
 TARAJI: WE MAKE IT MORE
 COMPLICATED.
 THAT IS WHAT THE MOVIE IS
 SAYING.
 WE WANT THE SAME THINGS.
 DR. OZ: MOVIE DIRECTOR ADAM
 SHANKMAN IS HERE.
 YOU MAY RECOGNIZE ADAM AS A
 JUDGE ON SO YOU THINK YOU CAN
 DANCE.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: DANCE YOUR WAY UP HERE.
 [LAUGHTER]
 ADAM: GOOD TO SEE YOU.
 DR. OZ: ESPECIALLY IN THE ERA OF
 ME TOO, SO MUCH ANGER AND
 FRUSTRATION, IT IS DIFFICULT TO
 PREDICT WHAT MEN ARE THINKING,
 OR WOMEN, ACROSS GENDERS.
 WHAT IS A WAY WE CAN TAKE THIS
 AND -WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO
 READ MINDS?
 ADAM: FIRST I WANT TO SAY THANK
 YOU FOR HAVING US.
 NOTHING SAYS COME SEE OUR COMEDY
 LIKE POKING THROUGH A
 DISEMBODIED DISEASED STOMACH.
 [LAUGHTER]
 DR. OZ: A UNIQUE PROMOTIONAL
 TOOL.
 ADAM: THAT IS AMAZING.
 NOTHING IN THE MOVIE IS AS FUNNY
 AS WATCHING YOU DEAL WITH THAT
 STOMACH.
 [LAUGHTER]
 ADAM: THE MOVIE, TO ME, IS ABOUT
 THE IMPORTANCE OF LISTENING TO
 EACH OTHER, NOT MAKING
 ASSUMPTIONS.
 AS TARAJI SAID, MEN AND WOMEN
 BOTH WANT THE SAME THING, TO
 FEEL SAFE AND APPRECIATED AND
 ULTIMATELY RESPECTED.
 THIS IS NOT A MAN BASHING MOVIE
 IN ANY WAY.
 BOTH OF US SIGNED ON TO THIS
 MOVIE SAYING THAT WE WILL NOT
 MAKING MOVIE ABOUT A WOMAN WHO
 IS MADE WHOLE BY THE LOVE OF A
 MAN.
 [APPLAUSE]
 ADAM: IT IS ABOUT A WOMAN WHO
 BECOMES OPEN TO OUR RELATIONSHIP
 BECAUSE SHE SORT OF REALIZES --
 HAVING A WOMAN LIKE HER --
 [APPLAUSE]
 ADAM: THAT WAS THE ONLY REASON
 TO MAKE THE MOVIE FOR ME.
 TARAJI: I'LL PAY YOU LATER.
 DR. OZ: WE ALL KNOW WHAT WE
 WANT, WHICH IS LOVE, BUT THERE'S
 OTHER THINGS WE WANT, INCLUDING
 GOOD HEALTH.
 WE'RE GOING TO PLAY A GAME.
 WHAT MEN AND WOMEN DON'T WANT.
 ARE YOU READY?
 [APPLAUSE]
 TARAJI: OK.
 DR. OZ: MALE ON ONE SIDE, FEMALE
 ON THE OTHER SIDE.
 I'M GOING TO SAY A HEALTH
 CONDITION THAT NONE OF US WANT.
 TELL ME IF MEN OR WOMEN GET IT
 MORE OFTEN.
 FOR EXAMPLE, NAIL FUNGUS.
 DO MEN GET THAT MORE OFTEN OR
 WOMEN?
 AUDIENCE, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
 MEN.
 DR. OZ: WE HAVE THE SMARTEST
 AUDIENCE IN AMERICA.
 TARAJI: I CHANGE THAT.
 THE ONLY REASON I SAY WOMEN IS
 BECAUSE OF THE NAIL SHOPS.
 DR. OZ: I SHOULD CLARIFY,
 TOENAIL FUNGUS.
 TARAJI: TOENAILS, MEN.
 [LAUGHTER]
 DR. OZ: SHE GOT IT RIGHT.
 HIGH FIVE.
 IT IS MEN.
 WOMEN, ONCE IN A WHILE, LET
 THEIR TOES BREATHE.
 MEN DON'T.
 OK, WE GOING TO MOVE UP THE
 LADDER.
 SECOND TOPIC.
 WHO GETS HEMORRHOIDS MORE OFTEN?
 AUDIENCE?
 A LITTLE MORE MIXED HERE.
 TARAJI: I'M JUST GOING TO LISTEN
 TO THEM.
 [LAUGHTER]
 DR. OZ: I'M NOT ASKING THE
 AUDIENCE ANYMORE.
 WOMEN GET MORE HEMORRHOIDS WHEN
 THEY GET PREGNANT, BUT MEN CATCH
 UP.
 GO LIKE THIS.
 I DON'T KNOW IF YOU NOTICED, BUT
 THIS TISSUE IS THE SAME AS YOUR
 ANUS.
 ADAM: SO I'VE BEEN KISSING HER
 -FOR SO LONG.
 [LAUGHTER]
 TARAJI: OK.
 DR. OZ: AT THE END OF THE DAY,

 [LAUGHTER]
 DR. OZ: WHAT IS A TRUE STORY?
 ADAM: I'VE BEEN KISSING HER --
 [LAUGHTER]
 ADAM: SINCE THE DAY I TOOK THIS
 JOB.
 [LAUGHTER]
 TARAJI: YOU SEE WHY WE HAD HIM,
 OUR FEARLESS LEADER?
 HE KNOWS COMEDY AND TIMING.
 DR. OZ: WE WILL CALL THAT A
 TIME.
 LAST ONE, AUDIENCE, DON'T SAY
 ANYTHING.
 BAD BREATH.
 IS IT MORE WITH MEN OR WOMEN?
 WHO GETS IT MORE?
 TARAJI: I'M NOT CLAIMING THAT
 FOR US.
 WOMEN?
 DR. OZ: THE ANSWER IS WOMEN.
 TARAJI: HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?
 ADAM: THAT IS WHY I'M GAY.
 [LAUGHTER]
 DR. OZ: TARAJI AND ADAM'S NEW
 MOVIE OPENS TODAY.
 IT IS FANTASTIC.
 GOT BLESS YOU.
 GO SEE IT.
 WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
 [APPLAUSE]

     <i> Go to getfios.com today.</i>
 [APPLAUSE] DR. OZ: WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE,
 YOU PUT ON A FEW POUNDS AND THEN
 A FEW MORE, UNTIL ONE DAY YOU
 LOOK AT YOUR BODY AND IT DOESN'T
 LOOK LIKE IT DID LAST YEAR OR
 EVEN LAST MONTH.
 BUT WHAT IF A BULGE WASN'T
 WEIGHT GAIN AT ALL?
 WHAT IF IT WAS SOMETHING GROWING
 INSIDE OF YOU THAT COULD KILL
 YOU?
 THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED TO BRENDA.
 IT IS AN OUTRAGEOUS STORY AND A
 MEDICAL MYSTERY SOLVED JUST IN
 TIME.
 ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO, I
 NOTICED I WAS PUTTING ON WEIGHT.
 I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS MENOPAUSE.
 I STARTED WALKING A LITTLE BIT
 MORE AND EATING LESS.
 IT GOT TO A POINT WHERE I WAS
 NOT EATING AT ALL AND I WASN'T
 LOSING WEIGHT.
 I LOOKED IN THE MIRROR AND I WAS
 STUNNED.
 IT WAS A DIFFERENT PERSON.
 REALITY HIT AND I REALIZED THAT
 THIS EXTRA WEIGHT COULD ACTUALLY
 KILL ME.
 DR. OZ: IT COULD HAVE COST HER
 HER LIFE, BUT BRENDA DIDN'T JUST
 HAVE NORMAL WEIGHT GAIN.
 SHE HAD A 50 POUND TUMOR.
 SHE IS JOINING US NOW TO SHARE
 HER STORY.
 YOU DIDN'T GO TO THE DOCTOR FOR
 MONTHS.
 WHY?
 BRENDA: I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS
 MENOPAUSE.
 I DIDN'T HAVE ANY IDEA IT WAS A
 TUMOR GROWING.
 I JUST CHALKED IT UP TO GAINING
 WEIGHT BECAUSE I HAD ALL THE
 SYMPTOMS OF MENOPAUSE.
 DR. OZ: IF YOUR SYMPTOMS GOT
 WORSE AND YOUR HEALTH DECLINED
 RAPIDLY, WHAT HAPPENED?
 BRENDA: I COULDN'T WALK VERY
 FAR.
 I COULDN'T BREATHE.
 I COULDN'T EAT.
 I WOULD TAKE ONE BITE OF FOOD
 AND IT FELT LIKE IT WAS IN MY
 THROAT.
 THE BIG PART WAS I WASN'T
 SLEEPING.
 JUST GETTING UP FROM THE COUCH
 TO WALK TO THE BATHROOM TOOK THE
 BREATH RIGHT OUT OF ME.
 DR. OZ: BRENDA MADE THE
 APPOINTMENT WITH A DOCTOR.
 SHE HAD A CAT SCAN DONE.
 WHAT HE FOUND WAS SHOCKING.
 IT WAS A 50 POUND TUMOR.
 IT WAS A POTENTIAL CAUSE FOR
 LIMITING BLOOD SUPPLY TO HER
 MAJOR ORGANS, WHICH IS WHY SHE
 WAS HAVING THOSE SYMPTOMS.
 A MASS THAT WEIGHS ABOUT AS MUCH
 AS A SIX-YEAR-OLD GROWING INSIDE
 OF YOU.
 I'M SURE YOU ARE ALL NERVOUS.
 LET ME SHOW EVERYONE WHY
 BRENDA'S SURGERY WAS SO
 DANGEROUS.
 THESE ARE THE LUNGS.
 THIS BIG CIRCULAR STRUCTURE IS A
 MASS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BELLY.
 THAT IS THE UTERUS.
 THESE ARE THE INTESTINES.
 KIDNEYS ARE CRUSHED ON THE SIDE.
 THE LIVER IS PUSHED AWAY.
 EVERYTHING MOVED OUT OF THE WAY.
 BECAUSE YOUR STOMACH SHRUNK,
 THERE WASN'T ROOM FOR FOOD.
 IT PROBABLY AFFECTED EVERYTHING
 ELSE.
 LET ME SHOW YOU A CAT SCAN.
 THERE'S HER SPINE.
 THIS WHOLE MASS IS NOT SUPPOSED
 TO BE THERE.
 IT WEIGHS WHAT A SIX-YEAR-OLD
 WAYS.
 THERE'S THE LIVER AND INTESTINES
 CRUSHED.
 IT WAS SERIOUS.
 THEY NEEDED TO OPERATE
 IMMEDIATELY.
 AFTER TWO HOURS OF SURGERY, THEY
 REMOVED THE TUMOR WITH NO
 COMPLICATIONS.
 THEY FOUND THAT IT WAS THE NINE.
 AFTER THE SURGERY, YOU SAY YOUR
 HUSBAND BARELY RECOGNIZED YOU.
 HOW MUCH WEIGHT DID YOU LOSE?
 BRENDA: I WEIGHED 229 WHEN I
 WENT IN.
 I CAME OUT, POST SURGERY, I
 WEIGHED 182.
 THEY SAID I WASN'T DONE LOSING
 WEIGHT YET.
 I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT AMOUNT.
 BUT IT WAS CLOSE TO 50 POUNDS
 WHEN I WENT TO THE DOCTOR.
 DR. OZ: THEY FOUND OUT THERE WAS
 SOMETHING ELSE THAT WAS
 WORRISOME.
 AN ESTIMATED 200 MILLION WOMEN
 HAVE THIS.
 ONE IN 10 WOMEN IN THIS COUNTRY.
 I'M GOING TO WISH YOU WELL.
 GOD BLESS YOU.
 I'M GOING TO HELP EVERYONE
 UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY FOUND.
 BRENDA, HER PROBLEM IS BROUGHT
 ABOUT BY SOMETHING CALLED
 ENDOMETRIOSIS.
 I BROUGHT IN OB/GYN
 EXTRAORDINAIRE DR. JESSICA
 SHEPHERD.
 FIRST, WHY DOES IT GO
 UNDIAGNOSED SO OFTEN?
 SHE DIDN'T REALIZE SHE HAD
 ENDOMETRIOSIS.
 DR. SHEPHERD: ENDOMETRIOSIS IS
 ONE OF THOSE DISEASES AND
 CONDITIONS THAT IS OFTEN
 OVERLOOKED.
 IT TAKES SEVEN TO 10 YEARS TO
 DIAGNOSE.
 IT IS ONE OF THOSE DISEASES THAT
 MIMICS SOMETHING ELSE.
 YOU COULD HAVE NORMAL MENSTRUAL
 PAIN, BUT IF IT IS SEVERE, THAT
 COULD BE A CLUE.
 IT CAN AFFECT THE BOWELS, THE
 BLADDER.
 YOU MAY HAVE ISSUES THAT AFFECT
 THOSE ORGANS, NOT REALIZING IT
 IS ENDOMETRIOSIS, WHEN THE
 TISSUE THAT IS SUPPOSED TO STAY
 INSIDE THE UTERUS HAS GONE
 OUTSIDE OF THE UTERUS.
 DR. OZ: FOLKS WILL OFTEN
 COMPLAIN ABOUT PAIN, WHEN YOU
 ARE TRYING TO BE INTIMATE, YOU
 GET DISCOMFORT.
 BRENDA: MANY WOMEN DON'T GO TO
 THE GYNECOLOGIST AND COMPLAINED
 OF THAT ISSUE.
 DR. OZ: PEOPLE FEEL AWKWARD
 ABOUT IT.
 DON'T BE EMBARRASSED ABOUT
 LIFE-THREATENING PROBLEMS.
 BOWEL MOVEMENTS CAN BE PAINFUL.
 BRENDA: AND SOMETIMES WE'VE SEEN
 PATIENTS WHERE WE DIAGNOSE IT
 AND IT CAN INVADE THE BOWEL.
 THAT IS WHY THEY WILL HAVE
 PAINFUL BOWEL MOVEMENTS DURING
 THEIR PERIOD AND ALL THE TIME.
 DR. OZ: THANK YOU.
 APPRECIATE THE KNOWLEDGE.
 WHEN WE COME BACK, DR. PIMPLE
 POPPER IS IN THE HOUSE AND WE
 ARE
     MONDAY.
 [APPLAUSE] DR. OZ: BOILS, BUMPS, BULGING
 LUMPS.
 AS WE AGE, WE SEE OUR BODIES
 CHANGE IN SHOCKING WAYS.
 TODAY I HAVE A PIMPLE POPPING
 PROFESSIONAL.
 PLEASE WELCOME DR. PIMPLE POPPER
 HERSELF, DR. SANDRA LEE.
 SHE'S SEEN ALL KINDS OF BUMPS
 AND LUMPS.
 WHAT IS THE BIBIGGEST MISTAKE YU
 SEE FOLKS MAKING?
 DR. LEE: THEY DON'T COME IN SOON
 ENOUGH.
 I SEE SOME REALLY BIG ONES.
 DR. OZ: LET'S LOOK AT SOME OF
 THESE DIFFERENT BUMPS AND LUMPS
 THAT WE FIND IN OUR SKIN.
 WE'RE GOING TO START WITH ONE.
 DR. PIMPLE POPPER HERSELF IS
 HERE TO HELP FIGURE OUT THE
 ANSWERS.
 THIS IS A PRETTY TYPICAL IMAGE.
 DR. LEE: THIS IS WHAT I CALL AN
 ABSCESS, THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE
 KNOW AS A BOIL.
 THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE'S THIS
 PRESSURE UNDERNEATH AND WE
 NEEDED TO BE RELEASED.
 THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO DO
 AT HOME IS TO REALLY APPLY WARM
 COMPRESSES TO THIS.
 DR. OZ: IF YOU PUSH HERE, IT IS
 STILL SORT OF HARD.
 DR. LEE: THAT IS STARTING TO
 COME TO A HEAD, BUT WE NEED MORE
 OF IT TO COME TO A HEAD.
 WE WANTED TO GET SO SUPERFICIAL
 THAT IT RUPTURES ON ITS OWN.
 THE WARMTH DRAWS THIS TO THE
 SERVICE -THE SURFACE.
 DR. OZ: I MADE THIS FOR YOU.
 THE FIRST THING YOU SAID,
 THERE'S ALL THE LAYERS TO THE
 SKIN.
 YOU CAN GO PRETTY DEEP.
 YOU SAID, PUT A WARM COMPRESS ON
 THERE.
 HOW LONG?
 DR. LEE: MAYBE 15, 20 MINUTES.
 A HOT SHOWER HELPS.
 THAT HELPS TO BRING IT TO THE
 SURFACE.
 YOU WANT IT TO BECOME MORE
 SUPERFICIAL.
 THE MORE SUPERFICIAL SOMETHING
 IS, THE LESS LIKELY IT IS TO
 CAUSE A SCAR.
 YOU WANT TO GET RID OF THAT
 PRESSURE.
 THAT IS WHAT MAKES US SO
 UNCOMFORTABLE.
 DR. OZ: I'M GOING TO PUT THE
 GLOVES ON.
 LET'S SAY I PUT THAT ON THERE.
 READY TO GO.
 THERE'S A FLAT PART THERE.
 YOU ALSO HAVE A LITTLE HAIR
 STUCK IN YOUR PIMPLE.
 AS YOU PUT THE WARM SOAPS ON
 THERE, YOU GET A LITTLE WEAKNESS
 THERE.
 YOU START TO GET A LITTLE BIT OF
 THIS.
 I DON'T KNOW IF YOU EVER DO
 THIS.
 A STERILE NEEDLE.
 I'LL GO A LITTLE HORIZONTAL AND
 PUNCTURE IT.
 OFTENTIMES, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
 IS CONTINUE TO PUT THAT WARM
 COMPRESS.
 WITH TIME, IT WILL GENTLY, MORE
 AND MORE, AND HERE'S THE BEST
 PART.
 ONCE YOU'VE DRAINED THAT OUT,
 GET YOUR TWEEZERS, YOU CAN DO IT
 , GO IN AND GET THAT HAIR.
 THIS IS GOING TO FEEL SO GOOD.
 DOES THAT FEEL GOOD?

 YOU PAY TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS.
 ONCE THIS IS OUT, ALL THIS
 INFLAMMATION GOES AWAY.
 EVERYONE IS HAPPY.
 DR. LEE: THAT'S RIGHT.
 I NEED THOSE VIDEOS.
 THAT WAS GREAT.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: LET'S GO OVER ONE MORE
 PICTURE.
 THIS IS A PRETTY TYPICAL ONE
 THAT GUYS COMPLAIN ABOUT.
 THIS IS MAGNIFIED A LOT.
 DR. LEE: THIS IS A SKIN TAG.
 THIS IS NORMAL.
 THESE ARE COMMON ON PEOPLE.
 THEY OCCUR WHERE THERE'S A LOT
 OF FRICTION.
 THEY ARE COMMON.
 THEY ARE PART OF LIVING.
 SOMETIMES YOU GET SOME PRETTY
 BIG ONES.
 DR. OZ: HERE'S ONE, A REAL
 VIDEO.
 DR. LEE: I THINK THIS ONE WAS
 HANGING OFF THIS GENTLEMAN'S
 KNEE.
 I DON'T KNOW HOW HE LIVED WITH
 THIS.
 WE KNOW MET.
 I USE A SCISSOR HERE, A SERRATED
 SCISSOR.
 THAT DIDN'T ACTUALLY DO IT ALL.
 I HAD TO USE A BLADE AND REALLY
 GET IN THERE.
 IT IS HANGING OFF OF A SMALL
 STOCK.
 TRIMMING IT, AND I'M GOING TO
 CAUTERIZE THE BASE, AND THAT IS
 IT.
 HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY MORE SKIN
 TAG THERE.
 DR. OZ: IT WAS BEHIND HIS KNEE.
 COULDN'T BEND HIS KNEE ALL THE
 WAY.
 OLIVIA HAS ONE OF THESE.
 DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
 THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
 YOU ARE ABOUT TO SHOW US
 SOMETHING.
 HOW DOES IT AFFECT YOUR LIFE?
 IT IS A SKIN TAG AND IT WILL
 DEFINITELY AFFECT MY LIFE
 GREATLY.
 IT SNAGS ON MY BRAS AND IT IS
 REALLY ANNOYING.
 I'M REALLY HAPPY THAT IT IS
 GOING TO BE REMOVED.
 DR. LEE: IT IS ON YOUR BACK?
 THE RIGHT SIDE OF MY BACK.
 DR. LEE: I'M GOING TO HAVE YOU
 CLIMB UP HERE AND PUT MY GLOVES
 ON LIKE I DO IN MY OFFICE.
 DR. OZ: LITTLE MARK SO WE ALL
 CAN SEE IT.
 ARE YOU COMFORTABLE?
 IT IS PROBABLY THERE BECAUSE OF
 THE BRA RUBBING ON IT.
 I'M GOING TO MAKE A LITTLE MARK
 HERE.
 CAN YOU ALL SEE THAT?
 DR. LEE: I PUT A LITTLE
 ANESTHESIA JUST UNDER IT.
 ALL I DO IS I USE THESE SPECIAL
 SCISSORS THAT HAVE SERRATIONS ON
 THEM.
 THANK YOU.
 DR. OZ: THAT IS FAST.
 DR. LEE: THAT IS IT.
 DR. OZ: LOOK AT THAT.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. LEE: ISN'T THAT NICE?
 IT WILL BE NICE AND FLAT AND IT
 WILL HEAL GREAT.
 DR. OZ: ENJOY.
 DR. PIMPLE POPPER, YOU CAN CHECK
 OUT MORE HELPFUL TIPS.
 THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE CHANGES
 ARE GOING TO BE THERE, BUT IF
 YOU ARE NOT SURE, CALL YOUR
 DERMATOLOGIST.
 MAKE SURE YOU DON'T MAKE ANY
 MORE MISTAKES.
 YOU ARE ALL GOING HOME WITH A
      When you feed yourself            some oats,
  the oats feed your body fiber.
     Fiber helps keep things   moving through your system.
         Which is great.
     Because when you're good         to your system,
      it'll be good to you.
  Do you push through migraine?
     Mom, are you OK to play?
 Yeah honey, how about we play...
      princess and pirates?
   Imagine what you can do with   more migraine-free days.
             Arr!

 [APPLAUSE] DR. OZ: WE ARE BACK WITH DR.
 PIMPLE POPPER, SANDRA LEE, WHO
 SAYS THINGS WE FIND IN OUR SKIN
 CAN BE A PAIN, BUT CAN ALSO BE A
 SIGN OF SOMETHING DEADLY.
 LILY IS WITH US.
 I'VE GOT A LITTLE QUIZ FOR YOU.
 I'VE GOT THREE IMAGES APPEAR
 THAT ARE TYPICAL TO FIND ON THE
 BODY.
 TELL ME WHICH ONE IS THE MOST
 DANGEROUS.
 WE TALKED ABOUT THIS ONE.
 THAT IS A BOIL.
 THEY ALL LOOK SCARY.
 DR. OZ: DR. LEE, WHICH IS THE
 MOST LIFE-THREATENING?
 DR. LEE: THE LAST ONE IS THE
 MOST LIFE-THREATENING.
 THAT LOOKS LIKE IT COULD BE A
 MELANOMA.
 JUST BECAUSE THEY LOOK REALLY
 UGLY DOESN'T MEAN IT IS THE MOST
 DANGEROUS.
 DR. OZ: IF YOU SEE SOMETHING
 LIKE THIS, PLEASE GET IT CHECKED
 OUT.
 TAKE IT AWAY.
 DR. LEE: A STANDS FOR ASYMMETRY.
 IF YOU HAVE A MALL AND YOU CUT
 IT IN THE MIDDLE AND THE SIDES
 DON'T MATCH, THAT IS A POTENTIAL
 BAD SIGN.
 B IS BORDER.
 IF THE BORDER IS IN REGULAR,
 SCALLOPED OR JAGGED, THOSE ARE
 ALL POTENTIAL BAD SIGNS THAT YOU
 WANT TO BE AWARE OF.
 C IS COLOR.
 IF IT IS MULTIPLE COLORS, IF IT
 IS WHITE AND BLUE AND RED AND
 GREEN, THAT IS POTENTIALLY
 CONCERNING.
 D IS DIAMETER.
 IT IS BIGGER THAN THE HEAD OF A
 PENCIL ERASER, THAT IS SOMETHING
 WIKI ATTENTION TO.
 E IS EVOLVING.
 IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE GETTING
 SOMETHING NEW OR ONE OF YOUR
 MOLES ARE CHANGING DRAMATICALLY,
 THAT IS SOMETHING TO BRING TO
 THE ATTENTION OF YOUR
 DERMATOLOGIST.
 DR. OZ: THE GOOD NEWS IS THOSE
 AREN'T TRUE FOR A MOLE YOU HAVE
 ON YOUR BODY.
 CAN YOU GET A LITTLE COMFORT
 THERE?
 YES.
 DR. OZ: KEEP TRACK OVER HERE.
 DR. LEE, I HAVE A CHALLENGE.
 WE ARE BOTH SORT OF COMPETITIVE.
 I WANT TO GO HEAD TO HEAD TO SEE
 WHO POPS PIMPLES THE BEST.
 THERE IT IS.
 THESE ARE THE RULES.
 I WILL BEAT YOU.
 DR. LEE: SO YOU SPIN AND IT
 DETERMINES WHERE ON YOUR FACE
 YOU NEED TO POP A PIMPLE.
 HERE IT IS ON HIS RIGHT CHEEK.
 YOU WANT TO POP THE CORRECT WAY
 WITHOUT GETTING SPLASHED.
 DR. OZ: SO, VERY GENTLY.
 I GOT IT.

 YES.
 LOOK AT THAT.
 THAT FELT GOOD.
 NOW YOU ARE UP.
 DR. LEE: MY TURN.
 I'M GOING TO GET ONE RIGHT HERE.
 DR. OZ: THAT IS PROBABLY AN EASY
 ONE.
 DR. LEE: SOME OF THEM ARE HARDER
 THAN OTHERS.
 DR. OZ: SHE'S A NATURAL TALENT.
 YOU PRACTICE ALL DAY LONG IN
 YOUR OFFICE.
 DR. LEE: THAT WAS REALLY LUCKY.
 DR. OZ: ALL THE MARBLES.
 HERE I GO.
 LET ME TAKE THIS ONE OFF.
 OH!
 DR. LEE: AT LEAST IT WENT THAT
 WAY AND NOT ON YOUR SHIRT.
 DR. OZ: DID I LOSE?
 DR. LEE: WE WILL DO A REMATCH
 NEXT TIME.
 DR. OZ: I LOVE HAVING YOU HERE.

   Its breakthrough formula does   more...
            Wonderful.
     Sensitivity, strengthens     teeth...
 It kills germs through my whole mouth..
      I like your confidence.
          Thanks Mr. Lee!
 Now there's no such thing as too close.
          Yes, there is.
         No, there's not.
           Yes there is.
         No, there's not!
               Okay.
      <i> All-New Colgate Total.</i>

 Who said olive oil is the only heart-healthy cooking oil?
 Mazola corn oil has more cholesterol-blocking
 plant sterols than olive oil.
 And a clinical study showed it can help
 lower cholesterol 2X more.
 When it comes to heart-health, Mazola is a smart choice.

 [APPLAUSE] DR. OZ: DO YOU DREAM OF A
 FLATTER STOMACH WITHOUT HAVING
 TO EXERCISE?
 THERE'S A BRAND-NEW PROCEDURE
 THAT PROMISES TO BUILD MUSCLE
 AND BURN FAT WHILE YOU ARE
 LAYING DOWN.
 I'M ALWAYS SKEPTICAL OF
 TREATMENTS LIKE THIS.
 I ASKED DR. DENDY ENGELMAN TO BE
 HERE.
 SHE'S PART OF A GROUNDBREAKING
 STUDY TO FIND OUT ONCE AND FOR
 ALL, CAN YOU GET ABS WITHOUT
 EXERCISE?
 DR. ENGELMAN: THIS, WHAT IT
 IS DOING TO MY PATIENT IS THE
 EQUIVALENT OF 20,000 CRUNCHES IN
 ONE SESSION.
 DR. OZ: I SEE YOUR STOMACH
 COMING TOGETHER.
 IS IT UNCOMFORTABLE?
 A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE, BUT
 IT IS NOT UNBEARABLE.
 DR. OZ: HOW LONG DOES THIS TAKE
 TO SEE RESULTS?
 DR. ENGELMAN: YOU CAN SEE
 RESULTS -SHE WILL HAVE MORE
 DEFINITION, BUT THE RESULTS
 CONTINUE TO IMPROVE.
 DR. OZ: THIS IS LEO'S ABDOMINAL
 AREA BEFORE.
 AND THERE SHE IS NOW.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THOSE
 RESULTS?
 I'M REALLY HAPPY WITH THE
 RESULTS.
 THIS HAS BEEN AN AREA THAT HAS
 BEEN STUBBORN NO MATTER HOW MUCH
 I GO TO THE GYM.
 DR. OZ: ARE YOU SORE AFTERWARDS?
 DR. ENGELMAN: YES.
 DR. OZ: LIKE YOU DID A BUNCH OF
 CRUNCHES.
 YOU TAKE CARE OF A LOT OF
 PEOPLE.
 BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY REPLACE
 ACTUALLY DOING CRUNCHES.
 DR. ENGELMAN: THAT'S RIGHT.
 WE WANT TO MAINTAIN A HEALTHY
 LIFESTYLE.
 BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN AREAS THAT
 ARE STUBBORN.
 EVEN IN A REAL SELF INTERVIEW,
 90% OF PATIENTS SAID THIS WAS A
 GREAT WAY TO GO.
 BUT IT IS NOT GOING TO REPLACE A
 HEALTHY LIFESTYLE.
 DR. OZ: WHO IS NEXT?
 I THOUGHT SO.
 THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH.
 TOGETHER, CHANGE IS HAPPENING.
 OUR JOURNEY IS JUST BEGINNING.
 I'LL SEE YOU ALL NEXT TIME.
