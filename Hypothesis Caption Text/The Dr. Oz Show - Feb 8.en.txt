Yeah honey, how about we play... princess and pirates? Imagine what you can do with more migraine-free days. Arr! En garde! When you're not fighting through migraine imagine the possibilities. Once-monthly Emgality is used for the prevention of migraine in adults. It's specifically developed to help give you more migraine-free days. With Emgality about 60% of people had their migraine days cut in half or more. Do not use if you are allergic to Emgality or its ingredients. Emgality may cause allergic reactions, such as itching, rash, hives and trouble breathing, which can happen days after use. Call your doctor or get medical help right away if you have symptoms of an allergic reaction. The most common side effects include injection site reactions. What should we do tomorrow?
