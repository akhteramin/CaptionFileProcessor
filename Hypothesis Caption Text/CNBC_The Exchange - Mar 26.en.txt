 MIKE IN NEW YORK CITY, HOME BUILDERS
 THERE'S A LOT PESSIMISM
 AROUND HOUSING RIGHT NOW, WE
 THINK AFFORDABILITY IS GOING TO
 IMPROVE AS PRICES MODERATE AND
 WAGES INCREASE
 LET'S DO FINAL TRADE, MR.
 O'LEARY.
 IT'S A SELL UNTIL WE GOT IT
 OUT OF CONGRESS.
 MINIMUM VOLATILITY, THIS IS
 NOT A TRADE, IT'S MORE OF A CORE
 EXPOSURE
 I'M GOING WITH BIOTECH INDEX,
 STAYING THERE.
 STARBUCKS KEEPS CHUCKING
 HIGHER TODAY
 XLE
 OKAY.
 ALL RIGHT.
 GOOD STUFF
 DOW IS NOW UP 115 POINTS THAT
 DOES IT FOR US
 THE EXCHANGE WITH KELLY EVANS
 BEGINS NOW
 A RALLY FOR STOCKS SUBMIT A
 CALMER DAY FOR BONDS
 INDEXES ARE ON PACE FOR THEIR
 BEST START TO THE YEAR SINCE

 THIS MORNING'S DATA SHOWING
 WEAKNESS IN THE HOUSING MARKET
 THAT WAS BEFORE THE BIG DROP IN
 INTEREST RATES
 PLUS, PRICES ARE RISING AS MUCH.
 RED-HOT IPO'S.
 A WAVE OF START-UPS ARE SET TO
 HIT THE MARKET THAT ARE DEBAYING
 WITH GIANT LOSING.
 IS IT 1999 ALL OVER AGAIN?
 THE POSITIVITY RIGHT NOW IS
 THERE ALL THE SECTORS ARE HIGHER
 ON THE DAY
 AT ONE POINT WE WERE UP ABOUT
 279 POINTS
 CAN YOU SEE HERE, UP ABOUT 113
 NOW.
 THE POSITIVITY IS THERE, BUT NOT
 NEARLY AS MUCH SO AS IT WAS
 EARLIER THIS MORNING
 THE S&P HANGING AROUND THE 2815
 LEVEL, WE'VE BEEN WATCHING FOR
 MONTHS AT THIS POINT
 WATCH THAT AND THE NASDAQ UP BY
 2/3 OF 1%.
 ENERGY THE BEST PERFORMER ON THE
 DAY TODAY, AND YOU CAN SEE HERE
 OVER THE COURSE OF THE PAST
 YEAR, THE ENERGY ETF, THE OIL
 AND GAS EXPLORATION OF
 PRODUCTION HAVE SOME ROUGH GOES.
 AS OF LATE, WE'RE WATCHING THOSE
 ENERGY TRADES PLAY IN HERE AS
 WELL
 THE WORST PERFORMER ON THE S&P
 500 CARNIVAL CRUISE LINES,
 EARNINGS AND SALES CAME IN
 BETTER
 THE OUTLOOK DISAPPOINTED
 THEY CITED A HEAD WIND BECAUSE
 OF FUEL PRICES
 CARNIVAL SHARES OFF BY ABOUT 9%.
 YOU CAN SEE THEY'RE A DOWN TREND
 EVER SINCE
 OUR STOCK OF THE DAY OVER TO
 YOU.
 WE'LL SEE YOU IN A BIT.
 WELCOME TO THE EXCHANGE,
 EVERYONE
 MEANWHILE, TECH COMPANIES HAVE
 ISSUED THE MOST NEGATIVE
 WARNINGS ABOUT FIRST QUARTER
 RESULTS OF ANY SECTOR AND THE
 HIGHEST NUMBER OF WARNINGS FOR

 THE STOCKS HAVE HAD A STRONG
 START FOR THE YEAR
 LET'S DRILL DOWN ON THIS NOW
 WITH BOB POSANI.
 NO BIG HEADLINES, WE ARE OFF
 OF OUR HIGHS, EUROPE CLOSED A
 HALF HOUR AGO.
 BOEING IN UNDER PRESSURE TODAY
 WE STARTED AT 374 FOR BOEING
 WE'RE DOWN A LITTLE.
 ENERGY AS A BRIGHT SPOT.
 WE'RE TEN CENTS AWAY FROM $6 0E
 OIL.
 ENERGY STOCKS UP 2 OR 3%
 WE'RE WAITING FOR BREAKOUTS.
 WE'RE NOT GETTING ANY HIGH
 BREAKOUTS.
 STILL LITTERED WITH THE SAME
 NAMES.
 YOU'RE LOOKING AT CONSUMER NAMES
 LIKE GENERAL MILLS AND HER
 MUCHY.
 WAITING FOR SOME TECH BREAKOUTS,
 STILL A COUPLE POINTS AWAY
 THE GLOBAL GROWTH SLOWDOWN
 WE SAW INTEREST RATES GO DOWN,
 THE MARKET TENDS TO DROP
 TRADES MOVE UP, THE MARKET TENDS
 TO STABILIZE
 THE S&P 500 IS NOW ON TRACK
 FOR ITS BEST GAIN IN 10 YEARS,
 LET'S BRING IN ART HOGAN
 WELCOME TO YOU BOTH.
 WHAT DO YOU MAKE ABOUT THE
 STRONG START TO THE YEAR THERE'S
 BEEN A LOT OF NEGATIVE WARNINGS
 FROM THE TECH SECTOR
 IT HELPS JUST FINE
 IT HELPS TO HAVE A BAD END TO
 THE YEAR
 WE HAD A TERRIBLE END.
 THAT HELPS A BIT, IT ALSO HELPS
 TO HAVE A YEAR WHERE YOU'RE DOWN
 AND EARNINGS ARE UP 25%.
 WE'VE HAD A FEW THINGS THAT HAVE
 PIVOTED THIS YEAR, THAT ARE
 REALLY KICK STARTED -- WE HAVE
 THE FED PIVOT IN JANUARY AND GET
 EVEN MORE DONE
 WE'VE HAD A STABILIZATION OF THE
 DOWN DRAFT OF EARNINGS
 THE S&P 500 IS WHERE IT'S BEEN
 AFTER THREE WEEKS.
 THAT'S THE FIRST TIME WE'VE SEEN
 THAT STABILIZATION
 THERE'S AN IMPRESSION WE'RE
 GOING TO GET A DEAL DONE WITH
 CHINA.
 I THINK THOSE THREE THINGS ARE
 HELPING PROPEL THE MARKETS HERE.
 THERE'S A LITTLE LESS TALK
 ABOUT THE YIELD CURVE INVERSION.
 IT'S REALLY THE TWO-YEAR TEN
 YEAR THAT MATTERS.
 MIKE HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT
 THIS FOR A WHILE
 THIS IDEA THAT WE FOCUS ON
 CERTAIN PARTS OF THE YIELD
 CURVE, THOSE TELL STORIES AT
 CERTAIN TIMES.
 ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE BEEN
 PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION TO IS THE
 IDEA THAT FINAL STOCKS
 BANKS IN PARTICULAR, THE
 REGIONALS, THE ONES THAT DO MORE
 TRADITIONAL LENDING HAVE BEEN A
 WEAK SPOT.
 THAT'S BEEN TROUBLESOME.
 SOME PEOPLE ARE MAKING
 COMPARISONS ON A CONSISTENT
 BASIS.
 LIKE IN JAPAN, HAVE DEPRESSED
 THE FINANCIAL SECTOR, AS WE TALK
 ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN FOR
 THE COMING MONTHS, ONE PLACE THE
 FOLKS ARE LOOKING BEYOND THE
 YIELD CURVE ARE WHETHER OR NOT
 THOSE BANKS CAN STILL THRIVE IN
 AN ENVIRONMENT LIKE THAT
 WHERE CYCLICALITY --
 THE AUCTION HAPPENED AT THE
 TOP OF THE HOUR RICK, HOW DID IT
 GO
 I GIVE IT AN A MINUS.
 I WAS IMPRESSED WITH THIS
 KICKOFF OF 113 BILLION UNTIL
 SUPPLY
 THE OFFER SIDE OF THE MARKET WAS
 227 AND THE WENT ISSUED.
 LOWER YIELD HIGHER PRICE SOLID
 2.60 COVER
 THAT'S AGAINST A 2.65 TEN
 AUCTION AVERAGE.
 AND IF YOU CONSIDER IT'S THE
 BEST SINCE NOVEMBER OF 18, IT'S
 NOT TOO BAD.
 BY THE WAY, YOU WERE LOOKING AT
 TRENDS IN BID TO COVER
 THE TREND AUCTION IS 265
 THE 5 AUCTION TREND IS 252
 THE INDIRECT IS REALLY STELLAR,
 56%, THE BEST SINCE JANUARY OF

 JUST A SMITH BELOW AVERAGE,
 DEALERS TAKE A SMALL 30 POINT 7%
 OF THE AUCTION
 TOMORROW WE'LL BE 41 BILLION 5
 BUT A NICE START TO SUPPLY
 YOU'RE NOW GIVING AN A MINUS
 TO A BOND AUCTION GOING OFF
 AFTER WE'VE HAD THIS BIG SLIDE
 IN RATES OVER THE LAST WEEK OR
 SO, GOING BACK TO THE FEDS
 MEETING.
 YOU'D THINK, OKAY, YIELDS ARE
 FALLING AND THAT'S GETTING A
 LITTLE LESS ATTRACTIVE, YOU'RE
 SAYING IT'S GETTING MORE SO?
 IT'S HARD TO GET INTO THE
 PSYCHOLOGY OF INVESTORS.
 IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO ME, I
 WOULD BE MORE AGGRESSIVE IN
 SELLING OFF RISING RATES THAN
 RALLYING WITH LOWER RATES.
 THEN AGAIN, IF THE MARKETS GET
 IN SYNC WITH THE FED, AND THE
 FED'S IN THE CANOE JUST FLOATING
 FOR A WHILE, IT MAKES MORE SENSE
 TO THINK ABOUT IT ALONG THOSE
 LINES.
 THE RELATIVER FORM ANSWER OF
 THE TWO-YEAR YIELD VERSUS THE

 IF YOU HAVE THE TWO YEAR
 TRADING PRETTY CLOSE IN YIELD
 FROM THE TEN YEAR WHICH WOULD
 YOU RATHER BE.
 IT'S A STRANGE PERIOD
 YOU ORDINARILY DON'T THINK
 YOU HAVE MORE OF A GROWTH
 COVERAGE FOR THAT, INFLATION
 COVERAGE RISK PREMIUM, YOU'RE
 NOT SEEING ANY OF THAT RIGHT
 NOW.
 THE WORRISOME PART.
 WHAT DOES IT SAY ABOUT THE
 LONGER TERM PROSPECTS FOR THE
 OUTLOOK FOR WHAT WE COULD SEE
 FOR GROWTH AND INFLATION IN THE
 5, 7 OR 10 YEARS
 TELL US WHERE YOU THINK
 INVESTORS SHOULD BE POSITIONED
 WITH ALL THIS.
 A QUICK ANSWER TO WHAT YOU'RE
 TALKING ABOUT.
 WE HAVE SEEN FOR THE LAST TWO
 YEARS, THE FRONT END OF THE
 CURVE HAS BEEN ANCHORED TO OUR
 MONETARY POLICY.
 THE 10-YEAR COMPETES AGAINST THE
 GLOBAL TEN-YEAR AND THE FRONT
 END IS JUST COMPETING WITH EVERY
 ITERATION OF WHAT THE FED SAYS
 WE'VE HAD A FLAG FOR THE BETTER
 PART OF 18 MONTHS NOW.
 I THINK WHAT YOU HAVE TO THINK
 ABOUT --
 THE PRESIDENT ACTUALLY
 SPEAKING LIVE, IMPROMPTU AT THE
 CAPITOL, HE'S ON HIS WAY THERE
 FROM THE WHITE HOUSE
 YOU WANT TO LISTEN IN.
 THAT WAS IT, TO LISTENING IN.
 ARTHUR, FINISH YOUR THOUGHT,
 PLEASE
 ONE OF THE THINGS I ALWAYS
 TELL INVEST IRS TO BE CAREFUL
 OF, IT'S ATTRACTIVE TO LOOK AT
 THINGS LIKE UTILITIES AND
 STAPLES AND REEDS IN THIS
 ENVIRONMENT.
 YOU'RE SEARCHING
 RIGHT NOW STAPLES IS TRADING AT
 SOME OF THE LOWEST YIELDS FOR A
 LONG TIME.
 WOULD YOU AVOID THEM?
 I THINK THEY MOVE AROUND
 PRETTY QUICKLY
 WHERE WOULD YOU BE?
 REEDS ARE OKAY.
 IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR YIELD,
 THAT'S WHERE WE WOULD GO
 AWAY FROM THAT, YOU'D LOOK AT
 TECHNOLOGY, I THINK ENERGY HAS
 AN UP SIDE TO IT, I THINK THAT
 TECHNOLOGY IS GOING TO HAVE A
 GOOD RUN HERE.
 I THINK AS A COUNTER INTUITIVE
 PLAN, FINANCIALS ARE VERY CHEAP.
 THANK YOU SO MUCH
 A MIXED BAG OF DATA IN
 HOUSING TODAY, STARTS LAST
 MONTH, COMING IN WEAKER THAN
 EXPECTED
 BUILDING PERMITS DROPPING AS
 WELL
 NONE OF THIS AFFECTS THE RECENT
 DROP IN RATES FOR THE 30 YEAR
 FIXED MORTGAGE IN THE LAST FEW
 WEEKS.
 THE CHIEF ECONOMIST AT THE
 NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF
 REALTORS
 DIANA, FIRST TO YOU, IN A WAY,
 IT'S NOT A DROP, THE SLOWER
 INCREASE IN HOME PRICES, PLUS
 LOW RATES COULD HELP
 AFFORDABILITY AND THE MARKET,
 RIGHT?
 IT COULD HELP THE MARKET, IF
 YOU'RE GOING INTO THE SPRING
 MARKET RIGHT NOW, AND HAVE YOU
 THE LOWEST RATES WE'VE SEEN IN
 OVER A YEAR, AND YOU SEE THE
 PRICE GAINS SHRINKING, IT'S A
 GREAT TIME TO GET IN TO BE A
 BUYER.
 WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO BUY?
 WE SAW HOUSING STARTS DROP
 YEAR OVER YEAR
 THE BUILDERS NEED TO STEP UP
 OBVIOUSLY, CREATE MORE ENTRY
 LEVEL HOUSING, WHAT IS AVAILABLE
 FOR SALE IS ON THE PRICIER END
 EVEN THAT DROP IN MORTGAGE RATES
 IS NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE UP FOR
 THAT PRICING MARKET.
 I'M CURIOUS IF YOU CAN SPEAK
 TO THE REGIONAL DYNAMICS, AND IF
 THE SALT CAP IS HAVING A
 NEGATIVE EFFECT ACROSS
 CALIFORNIA AND NEW YORK IN
 PARTICULAR
 IS THAT PART OF WHY THOSE
 MARKETS ARE SOFTENING WITH OTHER
 PARTS DOING WELL
 WHAT ARE YOU SEEING PLAYING OUT
 ACROSS THE COUNTRY
 THE MARKET IS A SLOWER
 MARKET, AND NO DOUBT THE
 LIMITATION ON SALT IS HAVING AN
 IMPACT ON THE HIGHER END MARKET.
 AND CONSEQUENTLY, THE
 NORTHEASTERN STATES OF NEW YORK,
 CONNECTICUT AND NEW JERSEY
 SOFTER
 CALIFORNIA, I WOULD SAY IS MORE
 AFFORDABILITY ISSUES
 RIGHT NOW WE ARE SEEING A
 REVIVAL OF INTEREST.
 ONE LOOKS AT THE CLOSING DADATA
 FURTHERMORE, WE TRACK SOME OF
 THE SOFTER DATA, SUCH AS OPENING
 UP THE LOCK BOXES, WE HAVE A
 CENTURY LOCK COMPANY THAT
 MEASURES HOW MANY TIMES THE LOCK
 BOXES ARE BEING OPENED TO SHOW
 CLIENTS A HOME
 THAT IS RISING
 BUYERS ARE CLEARLY TAKING
 ADVANTAGE OF THE LOWER INTEREST
 RATES.
 THAT MAY BE MY NEW FAVORITE
 ECONOMIC INDICATOR
 I DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD TRACK
 THE LOCK BOX ACTIVITY OUT THERE
 IN THE HOUSING MARKET.
 DIANA, SAME QUESTION TO YOU
 ARE WE SEEING REGIONAL
 VARIABILITY HERE OR IS IT THE
 SAME MESSAGE NO MATTER WHERE YOU
 LOOK
 ALL HOUSING IS LOCAL.
 IN PRICIER MARKETS IT'S GOING TO
 BE MORE DIFFICULT.
 IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF SUPPLY
 AT THIS POINT.
 WE'RE SEEING BIG MARKETS WITH
 GREAT ECONOMIES.
 IN DALLAS, AUSTIN, TEXAS
 IN CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA OR
 IN VIRGINIA WHERE YOU TALK ABOUT
 THE AMAZON EFFECT.
 YOU'RE SEEING GREAT DEMAND
 THERE'S A LOT OF BUYER TRAFFIC
 COMING THROUGH THESE HOMES
 WILL THAT TRAFFIC TRANSLATE INTO
 CLOSED SALES
 IF MORTGAGE RATES STAY LOW, YOU
 WILL SEE A MORE ROBUST SPRING.
 IT WAS INTERESTING TODAY THAT
 EVERYONE WAS KIND OF ON THE
 FENCE, I TALKED TO A LOT OF
 ANALYSTS WHO COME OUT SAYING, WE
 THINK THERE'S A LOT OF DEMAND
 HERE, THERE SHOULD BE ALL THIS
 PENT UP DEMAND BUT WE'RE STILL
 WORRIED ABOUT THAT
 AFFORDABILITY.
 ON THE KBRIBRIGHT SIDE, I TALKEO
 ONE ANALYST WHO SAID, BIG
 BUILDERS ARE STARTING TO ENTER
 THE MARK PETP ESPECIALLY FOR THE
 BIG PRODUCTION BUILDERS WHO CAN
 BUILD A LOT OF SMALLER HOMES
 MORE CHEAPLY IN A PRODUCTION
 LINE
 THEY'RE GOING TO BE MOVING AND
 THAT IS SOME GOOD NEWS
 YOU.
 MENTIONED THE HIGH END OF THE
 MARKET IS WEAK
 DO YOU SEE THE LOWER END HOLDING
 UP
 LOWER END IS VERY HOT
 ANYTHING THAT SHOWS UP IS BEING
 GRABBED BY THE BUYERS.
 SOMETIMES MULTIPLE BIDDING STILL
 HANGING AROUND IN MARKETS.
 THERE IS A DEMAND, ALONG THE
 MILLENNIAL GENERATION IT'S JUST
 A MATTER OF INVENTORY CHOICES.
 THE CONSUMERS ARE SAYING THEY
 WANT TO SEE FEW HOMES.
 WE NEED INCREASED SUPPLY ON THE
 LOWER END.
 I THINK WE OPENED 30 LOCK
 BOXES BEFORE WE FOUND ONE WE
 LIKED.
 HERE'S WHAT ELSE IS COMING
 UP
 YOUR MUSIC, YOUR BROWSING,
 YOUR HEALTH, AND NOW YOUR
 FINANCES
 APPLE LAUNCHES ITS OWN CREDIT
 CARD, BOASTING A SLEW OF PERKS
 ONE EXPERT SAYS IT'S MORE BITE
 THAN BARK.
 WE'RE GOING TO PARTY LIKE IT'S

 MANY OF HOT IPO'S SET TO HIT THE
 MARKET MAKE NO MONEY
 IS THIS A REPEAT OF THE DOT COM
 BUBBLE
 AND THE DRIVE THROUGH MAY
 SOON KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO ORDER
 BEFORE YOU DO.
     You're turning onto the             street
         when you barely       clip a passing car.
          Minor accident       —no big deal, right?
      Wrong. Your insurance      company is gonna raise
    your rate after the other    car got a scratch so small
         you coulda fixed          it with a pen.
    Maybe you should take that    pen and use it to sign up
         with a different        insurance company.

 WELCOME BACK, APPLE ANNOUNCING IT'S PARTNERING WITH
 GOLDMAN SACHS AND MASTERCARD
 IT WILL HAVE NO FEES, CASH BACK
 REWARDS PAID OUT DAILY
 DYNAMIC FINANCIAL TOOLS, PLUS A
 CARD MADE OUT OF TITANIUM.
 IT COULD BE MORE GIMMICK THAN
 GAME CHANGER
 JOINING ME WITH THEIR TAKES ARE
 KATE ROONEY.
 IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU BOTH
 HERE
 WHAT DOES DIFFERENTIATE APPLE
 CARD FROM WHAT'S ALREADY ON THE
 MARKET IF ANYTHING
 THE BIGGEST DIFFERENTIATOR IS
 THE TITANIUM CARD.
 IT'S A REALLY COOL LASER EDGE.
 COULDN'T SOMEONE ELSE COME
 OUT WITH A TITANIUM CARD
 TOMORROW IF THAT'S THE CASE?
 THEY COULD.
 WHEN YOU LOOK INTO THE MEAT
 OF THIS, THE REWARDS, THE FEES,
 THE INTEREST RATES
 ALL THAT STUFF EXISTS ON OTHER
 CARDS.
 THE BIG DIFFERENTIATOR HERE IS
 THE METAL ITSELF OR THE APPLE
 NAME


 THEY'RE CLEARLY LOOKING TO
 SELL THE INTERFACE, THAT'S WHY I
 WONDER IF IT'S A GLIMPSE OF
 HAVING LARGER ASPIRATIONS P.M.
 IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT, AND
 ESPECIALLY, YOU THINK OF ALL
 THESE TECH COMPANIES, THAT'S
 THEIR THING, HAVING THE COOL
 INTERFACE, NO FEES
 THESE COOL LOOKING CREDIT CARDS.
 I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE A
 CREDIT TO THIN TECH, WHY NOT GO
 ON YOUR iPHONE VERSUS GOING AND
 GETTING A BRAND NEW ACCOUNT, A
 BRAND NEW CREDIT CARD.
 I WONDER TOO.
 YES, I UNDERSTAND IT'S JUST A
 CREDIT CARD, AND IT'S NOT AS IF
 APPLE IS GOING TO BECOME A BANK
 TOMORROW, IS THERE A WAY IN
 WHICH THEY COULD SAY -- THOSE
 TYPES OF FEATURES WHERE IT'S
 ROUNDING UP TO THE NEAREST
 DOLLAR TO HELP YOU SAVE.
 OR OTHER THINGS THAT ARE ALREADY
 EMBEDDED IN THIS CARD, THAT
 SUGGEST THEY CAN TAKE ON SOME OF
 THOSE ASPECTS IF THEY WANTED TO.
 I THINK SO, THE BIG WORRY IS
 IF THEY EVER GOT INTO CUSTOMER
 DEPOSITS
 EVEN JUST THE CUSTOMER BASE IN
 GENERAL, APPLE HAS A REALLY
 LARGE AND LOYAL CUSTOMER BASE.
 THE SECURITY ASPECTS OF THIS,
 THEY DON'T HAVE A SIGNATURE,
 THERE'S NO NUMBER ON THIS CARD
 AS FAR AS KEEPING YOUR
 INFORMATION SAFE
 THEY PROVED YOU'RE ABLE TO
 PROVIDE SOMETHING THAT WON'T BE
 HARKED
 AND IF YOU DO GET HACKED YOU'RE
 GOING TO THE GENIUS BAR.
 THERE'S NOT A NUMBER OR
 CONSTANT CHANGING SECURITY CODE.
 IS THIS LIKELY SOMETHING THAT
 WE'RE GOING TO SEE OTHERS ADOPT?
 IT'S BLENDING THE APP WITH A
 PHYSICAL CARD.
 WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE IS GO ALL
 IN ON ONE OF THESE CATEGORIES,
 HAVING SOMETHING TRULY
 DIFFERENTIATED IN FINTECH.
 TAKE ON MINT FOR INSTANCE.
 OR HAVE A MEGA SIGNUP BONUS OR
 REALLY AMAZING ONGOING REWARDS
 OR SOME INCREDIBLE ZERO% OFFER
 THEY DID A SERIES OF HALF
 MEASURES, THEY HAVE ENOUGH CASH
 ON THEIR BALANCE SHEET
 I WOULD HAVE GONE ALL IN ON ONE
 OF THOSE
 AND GAIN THAT MARKET SHARE
 HOW WOULD YOU DO THAT RIGHT
 NOW?
 2% CASH BACK, 3% ON APPLE
 PRODUCTS, WHAT WOULD BE A
 ENOUGH
 YOU CAN GET 2% CASH BACK ON
 THE CITI DOUBLE CASH
 3% ON THE MOBIL BANK CARD.
 I THINK 3% CASH BACK ON
 EVERYTHING WOULD HAVE GOTTEN A
 LOT OF ATTENTION
 MAYBE WORTH $11,000 OR MORE.
 THAT WOULD GET MORE PEOPLE'S
 ATTENTION.
 BUT IT WOULD ALSO COST MONEY.
 EVEN WITH THE CHASE CARD,
 SAPPHIRE AND OTHERS HAVE ALMOST
 DONE TOO WELL.
 WE DON'T CARE, WE WANT THESE
 PEOPLE FOR THE LONG RUN, IT'S
 WORTH IT
 CAN APPLE AFFORD FOR THIS TO BE
 A LOSS LEADER?
 IT'S A FAIR POINT
 WHAT I WOULD DO FOR THE FUTURE,
 I WOULD GET IN NOW, TRY TO
 GOBBLE UP A TON OF MARKET SHARE,
 MAYBE TAKE CASH OFF THAT BALANCE
 SHEET AND GET MORE PEOPLE IN THE
 DOOR, THAT'S WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN
 CHINA.
 THOSE SERVICES ARE REALLY
 BECOMING THE RAILS THAT PROCEED
 SES ALL OF THESE FINANCIAL
 TRANSACTIONS.
 THROUGH MESSAGING
 IT'S HARD TO DO IN THE U.S.
 BECAUSE OF REGULATION AND IT'S
 HARD TO GET A BANK CHARTER, I
 THINK THERE ARE WAYS THAT THESE
 SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES COULD BE
 DOING MORE, BECAUSE RIGHT NOW,
 LIKE APPLE PAY, IT JUST
 PROCESSES THROUGH THE EXISTING
 RAILS.
 I THINK THERE'S MORE THAT COULD
 BE DONE.
 IRWONDER ABOUT ON BOARDING
 PEOPLE TOO
 A CREDIT CARD IMPLIES YOU HAVE
 CREDIT
 WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR SAYING,
 YOU DON'T QUALIFY FOR THE APPLE
 CARD
 AND IS THAT A BRAND ISSUE?
 WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU HAVE AN
 iPHONE AND CAN'T GET ACCESS TO
 THE CREDIT CARD.
 WHETHER THEY HAVE LARGER
 INTENTIONS HERE, WE'LL SEE
 I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT
 THANK YOU VERY MUCH, KATE ROONEY
 AND TED ROSSMAN.
 A LOT OF THE TECH COMPANIES
 GOING PUBLIC THIS YEAR HAVE ONE
 THING IN COMMON, THEY'RE NOT
 MAKING MONEY

           <i> CME Group -</i>     <i> How the world advances.</i>
 LET'S CATCH YOU UP ON A FEW STORIES TODAY THAT SHOULD BE ON
 YOUR RADAR
 DOMINICK CHIU IS BACK.
 LET'S TALK ABOUT PURDUE PHARMA
 WHICH JUST AGREED TO A
 SETTLEMENT WITH THE ATTORNEY
 GENERAL OF OKLAHOMA.
 THE WALL STREET JOURNAL IS
 REPORTING THAT PURDUE WILL PAY
 270 MILLION TO SETTLE THE FIRST
 OF OVER 1600 LAWSUITS.
 THIS IS HUGE ONLY BECAUSE OF
 THE SHEER SIZE OF SETTLEMENT
 NUMBER ONE
 AND THEN THE NATURAL INCLINATION
 IS TO TRY TO TRANSLATE THAT INTO
 1600 OTHER CASES AND THERE'S NO
 WAY THIS COMPANY CAN SURVIVE
 THE COMPANY HAS SAID THEY HAVE
 TO LOOK AT BANKRUPTCY TO PROTECT
 ASSETS THERE'S NO WAY THEY CAN
 PAY OUT A SETTLEMENT MORE THAN
 1600 TIMES
 YOU HAVE A NATIONAL STAGE FOR
 OPIOD ADDICTION.
 AND THIS ONE COMPANY IS THE
 LIGHTNING ROD OF IT.
 IF THAT COMPANY DOESN'T HAVE
 THE RESOURCES, IS IT GOING TO GO
 ELSEWHERE.
 THE TOBACCO SETTLEMENT IN THE
 '90s
 THEY DO HAVE THEIR VIABLE
 COMPANIES.
 THEY'RE EVEN LOWER TODAY
 HOW MUCH CAN PURDUE REALLY
 AFFORD TO PAY OUT.
 WELL, THE FAMILY THAT OWNS
 PURDUE, QUITE A BIT.
 YOU HAD PURDUE PAYING 270, OF
 THAT 270, 25 MILLION OF THAT
 CAME FROM THE FAMILY
 FOR YEARS THEY SAID THEY WERE
 PASSIVE SHAREHOLDERS IN THIS
 NOW IT EMERGES FROM THE
 MASSACHUSETTS CASE THAT THEY
 WERE DIRECTLY INVOLVED
 SO THEY COULD BE LIABLE.
 THEY'RE WORTH $13 BILLION, AND
 THIS IS ONLY A SMALL DROP IN THE
 BUCKET AND THEIR FORTUNE IS WELL
 DIVERSIFIED.
 THEY'RE GOING TO FACE A LOT OF
 PRESSURE PLUS NOW PEOPLE LOOKING
 TO GIVE THAT MONEY BACK.
 IS THIS A PRELUDE OF WHAT'S
 TO COME?
 OTHER MANUFACTURERS ARE STILL
 EXPECTED TO PROCEED, INCLUDING
 J & J.
 THAT'S A GOOD POINT
 LOOK AT SOME OF THE OTHERS THAT
 ARE MENTIONED, THERE'S NOT A LOT
 OF PRICING IN OF BILLIONS OF
 DOLLARS OF THESE PAYOUTS TO BE
 MADE
 THE QUESTION IS, IS THIS A
 REALTIME HANDICAPPING?
 MANY OF THESE COMPANIES COULD BE
 ENSNARED
 IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE WALL STREET
 REALLY FEELS AS THOUGH MANY OF
 THESE COMPANIES THAT ARE
 MENTIONED, IN BUT PERHAPS NOT AS
 CLEARLY FOCUSED ON AS PURDUE ARE
 GOING TO FIND SO MUCH OF THAT
 FALLOUT.
 THESE DAYS, PEOPLE TALK ABOUT
 JOHNSTON AND JOHNSTON.
 THEY'RE MORE WORRIED ABOUT BABY
 POWDER.
 THE FAMILY HAS MORE
 RESOURCES.
 MOVING ON TO CARNIVAL, THE
 CRUISE LINE FALLING AS MUCH AS
 8% TODAY
 THEY DID BEAT ON EPS AND
 REVENUE, BUT ISSUED WEAK
 GUIDANCE
 FUEL PRICES ARE GOING TO EAT
 AWAY AT FUTURE EARNINGS.
 THIS ON THE BACK OF THE CRUISE
 INJURY
 SEEN WITH THAT NORWEGIAN SHIP
 THAT RAN INTO SOME PROBLEMS THIS
 WEEKEND.
 IT DID.
 THE COMPANY LOWERED THEIR
 GUIDANCE
 CARNIVAL HAS A EUROPEAN PROBLEM,
 BOOKINGS ARE UP, BUT AT LOWER
 PRICING.
 WHICH IS TYPICALLY NOT WHAT WALL
 STREET WANTS TO SEE.
 THAT'S A GREAT POINT, WE KNOW
 IT'S IN GERMANY AND FRANCE AND
 SOME OF THESE OTHER COMPANIES.
 WE TALK ABOUT FRIDAY, THE BIG
 SELLOFF DAY.
 A LOT OF THE WEAKNESS WAS
 CENTERED THERE
 IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT, WHEN
 IT COMES TO TRAVEL AND LEISURE,
 THESE ARE SOME OF THE MOST
 DISCRETIONARY TYPE STOCKS.
 YOU DON'T TAKE A NICE CRUISE
 VACATION UNLESS YOU FEEL
 COMFORTABLE ENOUGH IN YOUR
 INCOME AND ABILITY TO TAKE THAT
 VACATION
 WE'VE BEEN LOOKING TOWARDS SOME
 OF THESE HOSPITALITY COMPANIES
 AS BELL WEATHERS
 AND THEY'VE BEEN PRETTY GOOD UP
 UNTIL NOW.
 WHAT I FIND A LITTLE MORE
 HEARTENING, THEY DON'T MENTION
 THERE'S A DROP OFF
 LOWER PRICING
 AND CURRENCIES.
 AND FUEL.
 BE SURE TO CATCH ARNOLD
 DONALD COMING UP AT 3:00 P.M
 KIND OF FOLLOWING ON THIS
 DISCUSSION, UP NEXT, AUTO SALES
 THIS YEAR ARE EXPECTED TO FALL
 BY NEARLY 5% FROM A YEAR AGO
 THAT'S ACCORDING TO JD POWER
 FEWER CARS ARE BEING BOUGHT.
 USED CAR SALES ARE ON PACE TO
 HIT THEIR HIGHEST LEVEL SINCE
 THE RECESSION.
 WE GET HEADLINES ALL THE TIME
 NOW ABOUT SLOWDOWN IN PARTS OF
 THE HOUSING MARKET, THE CAR
 MARKET
 THESE ARE SOME SPECIFIC PARTS,
 NOT NECESSARILY THE WHOLE THING.
 THEY SHARE BEING INTEREST
 RATE SENSITIVE
 WE DID SEE INTEREST RATES START
 TO DECLINE A LITTLE BIT.
 LIKE THE HOUSING MARKET.
 YOU SAW PRICES GO UP AND UP AND
 UP
 IT BECAME UNAFFORDABLE FOR A LOT
 OF HARD EARNING WORKERS.
 PEOPLE BACKED UP AND SAID, I'M
 GOING TO RENT FOR NOW.
 IT'S A RESET
 THE AVERAGE PRICE OF A
 VEHICLE NOW.
 OVER 33,000, YOU HAVE TO WONDER
 SOME OF THESE FIRST TIME BUYERS,
 IF IT'S JUST SQUEEZING OUT THAT
 MARKET
 KEVIN O'LEARY TALKED ABOUT
 THIS IDEA, IF P YOU WERE A YOUNG
 PERSON AGAIN, YOU WOULD ADVISE
 THEM NOT TO BUY A CAR.
 USE RIDE HAILING, USE LYFT AND
 UBER
 THEY'RE STILL SELLING 2.9
 MILLION CARS A YEAR, RELATIVE TO
 THE RECESSION LEVELS, WE'RE
 STILL WAY UP FROM THERE.
 IT'S FALLING DOWN A LITTLE BIT
 BUT IT'S THE FIRST FALL IN A
 LONG TIME.
 IT'S ODD TO SEE WHEN YOU HAVE
 A GROWING ECONOMY.
 CRITICS WERE OUTRAGED THAT
 SPIELBERG IS PUSHING APPLE'S
 STREAMING SERVICE.
 HE'S GOING TO NEED A BIGGER
 PR FIRM.
 THIS IS A LITTLE DISINGENUOUS
 FOR PEOPLE TO CRITICIZE HIM.
 HE WAS SAYING ALL STREAMING
 SERVICES
 HE MIGHT CONTINUE TO UPHOLD THAT
 EVEN WORKING FOR APPLE
 HE HASN'T SAID THAT APPLE
 SHOULD, NETFLIX SHOULDN'T.
 IT IS A LITTLE STRANGE FOR ONE
 OF THE GREATEST FILMMAKERS OF
 OUR TIME, WHO HAS LOVED THE
 AWARDS TO THEN GO TO APPLE
 YOU MAKE A DECLARATION LIKE
 THAT, AND YOU'RE STEVEN
 SPIELBERG, WE WANT FULL
 DISCLOSURE
 YOU WANT SOMETHING THAT'S
 WORKING ON A NETFLIX SORT OF
 COMPETITOR
 IT SPEAKS TO THIS LANDSCAPE,
 AND WHETHER FOLKS WERE
 ENTRENCHED IN A CERTAIN WAY OF
 DOING THINGS ARE MARRIED TO THAT
 PLATFORM A LITTLE MORE
 IN THIS CASE I WOULD NOT DECIDE
 TO NOT WATCH OR WATCH A MOVIE
 BECAUSE OF THAT PARTICULAR
 COMMENT.
 BUT MAYBE IT'S ONE OF THOSE
 SITUATIONS WHERE FOLKS DO TEND
 TO GRAVITATE MORE TOWARD CERTAIN
 PLATFORMS BECAUSE OF THE
 FILMMAKERS ARE INVOLVED IN
 THEY LIKE WHAT THEY DO OR
 DON'T.
 I DON'T THINK MANY PEOPLE WILL
 SAY, SPIELBERG IS A HACK, I'M
 NOT GOING TO WATCH HIS FILMS
 BAD NEWS FOR PELOTON USERS
 THIS IS A CRAZY STORY, THEY ARE
 YANKING CLASSES THAT FEATURED
 MUSIC NAMED IN A BIG PUBLISHING
 LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST THE
 COMPANY.
 NEARLY TWO THIRDS OF THE CYCLING
 CLASSES IN PELOTON'S ON DEMAND
 LIBRARY ARE NOW OFFLINE.
 ONE USER COMMENTED, I WANT TO
 CRY.
 I HAD OVER 20 BOOK MARKED RIDES
 AND NOW ONLY ONE IS LEFT
 I'M SO SAD
 WHAT IS LEFT.
 YOU GET RID OF ALL THE SONGS,
 IS IT WORK OUT TO KENNY G.
 OR SOMEONE YELLING AT YOU.
 IT'S ASTOUNDING TO ME THAT
 THEY DIDN'T GET THIS STUFF
 APPROVED AND LICENSED BEFORE
 THEY LAUNCHED.
 WHAT KIND OF DEAL ARE YOU GOING
 TO GET
 YOU'RE SO SMALL -- NO ONE
 REALLY CARES
 IS THIS THE UNDER THE RADAR
 TYPE OFFENSE
 THE BUSINESS MODEL THAT WORKS
 WHILE YOU'RE SMALL UNTIL YOU
 HAVE TO STAND ON YOUR OWN TWO
 FEET
 UNTIL YOU'RE ABOUT TO GO
 PUBLIC WITH AN $8 MILLION
 VALUATION.
 IT'S CERTAINLY NOTABLE HERE
 HAVING A PELOTON BIKE IN YOUR
 HOUSE IS A BIG INVESTMENT.
 IT'S OVER $2400.
 THE MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION FEE IS
 AROUND $40 A MONTH
 THAT'S WHY THE CUSTOMERS ARE
 UPSET.
 PUT INVESTED A LOT OF MONEY FOR
 THIS
 MAYBE YOU SHOULD BE PAYING
 $10 A MONTH.
 PEOPLE WHO ARE BIG FANS OF
 PELOTON ARE GOING TO SAY THIS IS
 THE BEST THING THAT HAPPENED
 SINCE JANE FONDA LEGGINGS.
 THEY THINK PELOTON IS THE WAY
 TO GO, EVEN IF THOSE CLASSES
 THEY LOVED --
 I FEEL BAD FOR SOME OF THE
 INSTRUCTORS WHOSE CLASSES ARE
 GONE FOREVER NOW
 YEAH, THEY WERE TIED TO
 SONGS.
 FROM A NEGOTIATING POINT
 THE ONLY THING THAT WAS DUMBER
 TO NOT DO IT IN THE FIRST PLACE
 IS TO HAVE A HUGE USER BASE
 THAT'S REALLY UPSET.
 NOW THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
 PAY A LITTLE MORE.
 THEY COULD HAVE TRIED TO RESOLVE
 IT INSTEAD OF PAYING UP.
 I'M SURPRISED THEY DIDN'T GO
 THAT ROUTE
 IT UNDERMINED THE WHOLE THING.
 THAT'S MY POINT, ONCE THAT
 NUMBER ONE
 THEY JUST SHOULD HAVE PAID IT,
 WHATEVER THAT NUMBER WAS THEY
 WERE ALREADY NEGOTIATING
 THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE THAT
 THIS IS DETANTE
 MAYBE NOT THE LEVERAGE.
 THANK YOU ALL
 LYFT IS THE FIRST OF THIS
 YEAR'S IPO'S THAT ARE SET TO
 DEBUT ON FRIDAY.
 WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT WHY
 INVESTORS HAVE SUCH AN APPETITE
 FOR MONEY LOSING COMPANIES
 <i> No matter where you are in life</i>   <i> or what your dreams entail,</i>

 LYFT IS EXPECTED TO GO PUBLIC FRIDAY.
 IT'S GOING TO BE THE FIRST IN A
 WAVE OF START-UPS ACCORDING TO
 THE WALL STREET JOURNAL THAT ARE
 DEBU
 DEBUTING GIANT LOSSES.
 ELLIOTT, HOW UNUSUAL ARE THE
 LOSSES FOR THIS YEAR'S ROUND OF
 COMPANIES?
 THEY ARE RECORD HIGH WHEN IT
 COMES TO U.S. START-UPS.
 $911 MILLION LAST YEAR
 I THOUGHT DOT K078 WAS FULL OF
 GIANT LOSSES
 THIS IS THE BIGGEST 12-YEAR
 LOSS -- 12-MONTH LOSS.
 WHAT ABOUT FACEBOOK AND
 GOOGLE BACK IN THE DAY BEFORE
 THEY IPOED
 BOTH OF THEM WERE RETURNING
 PROFITS BY THE TIME THEY IPOED
 IT'S ONE THING IF YOU'RE
 LOSING MONEY, BECAUSE YOU'RE
 GROWING SO QUICKLY
 IT'S ANOTHER THING IF YOU'RE
 LOSING MONEY, ALL OF A SUDDEN
 HAVE YOU TO MAKE MONEY ON YOUR
 OWN WITHOUT THAT
 PART OF THE REASON THEY'VE
 BEEN ABLE TO GROW SO QUICKLY
 THEY ARE BURNING CASH AT THIS
 POINT.
 THEY'VE ALLOWED COMPANIES TO PUT
 GROWTH FIRST AND PROFIT SECOND
 PRIVATE INVESTORS HAVE BEEN
 RECEPTIVE TO THAT.
 WE'RE GOING TO GET AN INDICATION
 WHETHER PUBLIC INVESTORS FEEL
 THE SAME WAY
 LIFT IS ABOVE THE SPECIFIC
 RANGE.
 WHEN IT COMES TO UBER WHICH IS
 EXPECTED TO IPO IN THE NEXT
 MONTH OR SO.
 LOSSES OF NEARLY $2 BILLION THIS
 YEAR
 THIS IS ENORMOUS.
 ELLIOTT, I WONDER, DOES LYFT,
 WE COMPARE THEM WITH UBER.
 DOES THAT HAVE A PATH TO
 PROFITABILITY BASED ON ITS
 CURRENT BUSINESS MODEL
 DO THEY HAVE TO RAISE PRICES TO
 GET THERE?
 THAT IS THE QUESTION.
 IT DOES NOT HAVE -- WE WILL BE
 PROFITABLE BY THIS YEAR.
 IT'S SORT OF UP TO THE INVESTORS
 TO INFER
 A LOT OF IT IS HOW MUCH DOES THE
 WAR WITH UBER GO ON OVER MARKET
 SHARE WHICH IS WHERE THIS IS
 GOING.
 DO COMPANIES HAVE TO MAKE
 LESS ATTRACTIVE PRICING, THE ONE
 THING THAT HAS DRAWN THEM SO
 MANY USERS
 I THINK THAT'S A REALLY GOOD
 QUESTION
 PART OF THE EQUATION IS THE
 DRIVERS.
 THEY'RE PROFITABLE, THEY CAN
 KEEP THEIR DRIVERS AND DRIVERS
 AS WE SAW YESTERDAY YOU HAD UBER
 AND LYFT DRIVERS, THERE'S BEEN
 SOME REGULATORY DISCUSSION
 IF THEY'RE EMPLOYED AS EMPLOYEES
 IN THE FUTURE, THAT'S A BIG
 CHANGE
 WHERE DOES THIS LEAVE US?
 WE CAN COMPARE THIS TO 1999,
 THAT WAS A DOT COM AND IPO
 FRENZY
 THEY'RE HAVING THEIR BEST
 QUARTER EVER, YOU'RE SEEING
 PRETTY GOOD PERFORMANCE.
 WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF COMPANIES
 DEBUTING
 IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE IT DID BACK
 THEN
 DO YOU THINK INVESTORS ARE BEING
 TOO KIND TO THESE COMPANIES
 THINKING THEY'RE GOING TO BE THE
 NEXT FACEBOOK AND GOOGLE AND NOT
 REMEMBERING THAT EVEN THOSE
 COMPANIES WERE PROFITABLE BY
 THIS POINT
 CERTAINLY THAT'S A LOT OF
 WHAT'S DRIVING IT?
 WE NEED TO GET INTO THE NEXT
 BIG THING.
 WHERE IT ENDS SORT OF LIES WITH
 THE FUNDAMENTAL BUSINESS
 AND HOW MUCH THEY CAN ACTUALLY
 MAKE PER RIDE.
 RIGHT NOW THEY LOSE MONEY ON
 EVERY RIDE
 I THINK THAT'S FOMO IN THE
 MARKET NOW, YOU'VE NEVER SEEING
 A RIDE SHARING COMPANY DEBUT
 THIS IS SOMETHING NEW AND SHINY
 FOR INVESTORS.
 YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS THAT,
 ESPECIALLY IF UBER, WHICH IS
 CALLING ITSELF THE PLATFORM, A
 TRANSPORTATION PLATFORM AND
 DIVERSIFYING INTO SO MANY
 BUSINESSES REALLY IS THE NEXT
 AMAZON OR FACEBOOK
 GREAT STUFF
 APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH.

 WELCOME BACK McDONALD'S MAKING A BIG
 ACQUISITION OF ISRAELI MARKETING
 FIRM DYNAMIC YIELD
 THIS IS IN HOPES OF MODERNIZING
 THE DRIVE THROUGH WINDOWS.
 IT'S THE BIGGEST ACQUISITION FOR
 McDONALD'S SINCE BUYING BOSTON
 MARKET BACK IN 1999.
 KATE ROGERS WITH THE DETAILS.
 McDONALD'S SPENDING $300
 MILLION ON DYNAMIC YIELD
 ACCORDING TO PEOPLE WHO ARE
 FAMILIAR WITH THE DEAL
 THE COMPANY USES DECISION
 TECHNOLOGY TO HELP PERSONALIZE
 THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE IN ITS
 DRIVE THROUGHS
 THE NEW MENU SHOWS FOOD BASED ON
 THE TIME OF DAY, WHETHER CURRENT
 TRAFFIC IN STORES AND EVEN
 TRENDING MENU ITEMS.
 THE TECH WILL USE DATA TO
 INSTANTLY SUGGEST AND DISPLAY
 ADDITIONAL ITEMS THAT CUSTOMERS
 MIGHT LIKE BASED ON WHAT THEY'VE
 JUST ORDERED
 THE COMPANY TESTED THIS
 TECHNOLOGY IN A FEW LOCHS ATIONS
 LAST YEAR AND THEN TOP
 INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.
 FROM THERE, McDONALD'S WILL
 INTEGRATE THE TECHNOLOGY INTO
 DIGITAL EXPERIENCE TOUCH POINTS
 INCLUDING KEY IKIOSKS
 THE EXPERIENCE OF THE FUTURE
 ROLLOUT THE STORE HAS TAKEN ON
 AS IT MODERNIZES AND ADAPTS TO
 CHANGING CUSTOMER PREFERENCES
 AND ANALYSTS I TALKED TO
 BASICALLY SAID RESTAURANT
 COMPANIES KNOW THAT CUSTOMERS
 MORE THAN EVER WANT THE SPEED
 AND CONVENIENCE.
 SOMETIMES EVEN MORE SO THAN
 VALUE AND THIS IS THE REALLY
 SMART MOVE FOR McDONALD'S
 BECAUSE IT'S FORWARD THINKING,
 KEEPS THEM VERY RELEVANT AND
 MAKE THINGS EASIER AND MORE
 PERSONALIZED
 IT'S FASCINATING BECAUSE BACK
 IN THE '90s, WE TALKED ABOUT
 BOSTON MARKET OR THE FACT THEY
 USED TO OWN CHIPOTLE, THIS IS A
 NON-FAST FOOD ACQUISITION.
 IT'S A MARKETING FIRM TO HELP ON
 TECHNOLOGY
 IT'S DIFFERENT AND FASCINATING
 AND IF I'M GOING THROUGH THE
 DRIVE-IN, KATE, WHAT'S LIKELY TO
 CHANGE
 THE MENU I'M LOOKING AT?
 ARE THEY GOING TO KNOW FROM MY
 LICENSE PLATE, FOR EXAMPLE, WHAT
 I'VE ORDERED IN THE PAST AND
 CUSTOMIZED FOR THAT?
 MY UNDERSTANDING, THEY'LL USE
 THE DATA ON WHAT YOU ORDER AND
 SUGGEST THINGS YOU LIKE BUT
 ITEMS THAT WORK WELL IN THE
 REGION
 THEY MIGHT BE POPULAR THIS,
 BASED ON THE WEATHER, YOU COULD
 SEE AN ICE CREAM CONE TODAY.
 THEY'LL CHANGE AND ADAPT
 DEPENDING ON THOSE DIFFERENT
 FACTORS.
 MAKE IT MORE PERSONAL FOR YOU,
 PEOPLE LOVE THAT.

         Alpha seems more          elusive today.
     Is it because so many     go after it the same way,
        chasing after        short-term returns?
        Instead if getting    caught up with the crowd,
 the investment managers at PGIM take a long term view.

 WELCOME BACK FEBRUARY JOBS DISAPPOINTED
 WE ONLY ADDED 20,000 PAYROLLS
 BUT NOT BAD AS IT APPEARS.
 HERE TO BREAK DOWN JOB TRENDS
 AND MORE IS CAROLINA FAIRCHILD
 THANK YOU, KELLY.
 YOU SAW A 3% SLOWDOWN ON
 HIRING FEBRUARY FROM LAST YEAR
 IS THAT RIGHT?
 THAT IS RIGHT
 IT WAS THE THIRD CONSECUTIVE
 MONTH WE'VE SEEN A SLOWDOWN OF
 HIRING ON LINKED IN.
 JOBS STILL THERE BUT EMPLOYERS
 NOT HIRING THE RATE THEY WERE
 BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR.
 ON THE DEMAND SIDE, THEY'RE
 LOOKING, THE POSITIONS MIGHT BE
 OPEN OR MORE, SOME THEORIES SAY
 THE LABOR MARKET IS SLOWING
 BECAUSE PEOPLE CAN'T FIND
 QUALIFIED WORKERS TO FILL THE
 POSITION.
 THERE IS A COMPONENT HERE
 WITH THE WORKFORCE NEEDING TO
 ADAPT TO THE POSITIONS THAT ARE
 THERE IN THE WORKFORCE RIGHT
 NOW.
 WE TALK ABOUT AI, AUTOMATION,
 CHANGING THE JOBS THAT ARE
 AVAILABLE.
 WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS WORKERS
 MOVE OUT OF MORE ROUTINE JOBS
 INTO NON-ROUTINE JOBS THAT DON'T
 REQUIRE AS MUCH TECHNOLOGY.
 IT'S INTERESTING.
 YOU SAY THEY'RE REPETITIVE DESK
 JOBS AND THOSE ON THE DECLINE
 BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGY.
 THAT IS CORRECT
 SO THESE WORKERS ARE SEEING A
 DECLINE IN JOBS AND PROVIDING
 MORE FLEXIBILITY AND HIGHER PAY.
 A LOT OF MYTHS OF PEOPLE WITHOUT
 COLLEGE DEGREE NOT SEEING ENOUGH
 JOB OPPORTUNITIES BUT THERE ARE
 A LOT FOR NON-ROUTINE WORK
 ELECTRICIANS, PLUMBERS, DRIVERS.
 CONSTRUCTION, HEALTH CARE,
 ALL NON-ROUTINE AND THE GROWTH,
 HOW MUCH GROWTH ARE WE TALKING
 ABOUT?
 AND SO THESE ARE JOBS THAT
 BASICALLY ANYBODY COULD FILL
 THE GROWTH WE'RE SEEING IN
 NON-ROUTINE JOBS IS LIKE
 MIMICKING SOME OF THE DECLINE IN
 NON-ROUTINE.

 4% GROWTH THAT'S MIMICKING 3%
 DECLINE.
 OKAY, THAT'S HAPPENING
 UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE
 I'M CURIOUS GOING BACK TO THIS
 OVERALL NUMBER HERE ABOUT THE
 HIRING SLOWING DOWN.
 ANYTHING MORE YOU CAN TELL US
 ANECDOTALLY WHY COMPANIES MIGHT
 BE SLOWING UP A BIT?
 I THINK WHAT WE SEE ON LINKED
 IN IS EMPLOYEES BEEFING UP THEIR
 PROFILES TO BE MORE ATTRACTIVE
 TO EMPLOYERS
 PERHAPS TAKE CLASSES ON LINKEDIN
 LEARNING TO BE MORE ATTRACTIVE
 FOR THE JOBS BECOMING FEWER AND
 FEWER.
 IT IS INTERESTING THAT, YOU
 KNOW, BECAUSE THE PAYROLL
 ITSELF, 20,000, THAT WAS A
 SLOWDOWN, BUT THE WAGE NUMBER IN
 THERE WAS VERY GOOD.
 THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE COMES FROM
 DIFFERENT SURVEYS, VERY GOOD
 THE SHARE OF PEOPLE IN THE LABOR
 FORCE, A LOT OF POSITIVE TRENDS
 AND I WONDER, IS THE SLOWDOWN
 REFLECTING SOMETHING IN WEATHER
 LITERALLY OR TRADE ISSUES AND
 PARTS OF THE ECONOMY ARE
 SLOWING.
 THERE IS SOME OF THAT GOING
 ON AND SEE AN UPTICK AFTER THE
 SHUTDOWN IN SOME OF THE SECTORS
 WHERE THERE WAS MORE OF A
 SLOWDOWN BECAUSE OF THE
 SHUTDOWN
 WE'RE SEEING MORE PLAYERS PICK
 UP THOSE JOBS.
 MEGAN, QUICKLY FOR YOU, FROM
 MIKE IN NEW YORK CITY, HOM IT'S
 RATHER THAN HAVING IT DOWN
 LOADED AUTOMATICALLY.
 AND YOU JUST MAKE THE
 ANNOUNCEMENT AS YOU POINTED OUT
 THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT.
 THANK YOU SO MUCH, SIR.
 YOU CAN FOLLOW ME ON FACEBOOK
 AND TWITTER OR TWEET THE SHOW AT
 THE LEAD CNN AND OUR COVERAGE ON
 CNN CONTINUES RIGHT■  NOW.
 CHARGED WITH LYING TO POLICE.
 I'LL TALK TO CALLING IT A WHITE
 WASH.
 GREAT REPORT AFTER MONTHS OF
 TOSSING AROUND PHRASES LIKE
 WITCH HUNT AND HOAX PRESIDENT
 TRUMP CALLS ROBERT MUELLER'S
 REPORT GREAT.
 HE FALSELY CLAIMS IT EXONE
 GIULIANI IS HERE IN THE
 SITUATION ROOM LIVE.
 WE PEEL AND REPEAL AS THE TRUMP
 ADMINISTRATION TO A ELIMINATE
 THE ACT.
 WHY DEMOCRATS FEEM THEY HAVE A
 NEW WEAPON.
 IS IT A MESSAGE TO NORTH KOREA?
 I'M WOLF OF BLITZER.
 YOU'RE IN THE■■■ SITUATION ROOM.
 THEY FURIOUS WHO CALLS IT A
 WHITE WASH OF JUSTICE.
 ALSO AS THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
 SAYS IT WILL TAKE WEEKS TO
 RELEASE THE MUELLER REPORT.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP SEIZES TO
 DECLARE VICTORY WHILE FALSELY
 CLAIMING THAT THE SPECIAL
 COUNSEL EXONERATED HIM OF
 OBSTRUCTION.
 THE PRESIDENT IS USING MUELLER'S
 FINDINGS TO ATTACK CRITICS.
 IT MAY HAVE JUST GIVEN DEMOCRATS
 A 2020 BATTLE CRY WITH A NEW
 EFFORT TO GET RID OF OBAMACARE.
 RUDY GIULIANI IS STANDING BY.
 LET'S BEGIN WITH TODAY'S
 SHOCKING DEVELOPMENTS IN THE
 SMOLLETT CASE.
 SO HOW IS EVERYONE EXPLAINING
 THIS EXTRAORDINARY TURN OF
 EVENTS.
 RIGHT NOW THEY ARE NOT.
 IT HAS BEEN AHEAD SKRAFRPING
 FROM THE PUBLIC TO THE MAYOR'S
 OFFICER.
 PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW HOW HE ENDED
 UP HERE.
 THE JUDGE HAS SEALED THIS CASE.
 HT CHICAGO OFFICIALS FUR■
 USE.

  FURIOUS.
 WHERE DO I THINK JUSTICE IS
 THIS?
 I THINK THIS CITY IS STILL
 AN APOLOGY.
 ALL CHARGES WERE DROPPED
 AFTER HE WAS ACCUSED OF STAGING
 AN ATTACK TO LOOK LIKE A HATE
 CRIME.
 WE FOUND OUT ABOUT WHEN YOU
 ALL DID.
 OFFICIALS CLAIMING THAT IT
 WAS A HOAX.
 THE STATE SEALING ALL OF THE
 EVIDENCE IN THE CASE.
 CLOSE TO HIDE BEHIND SECRECY
 AND BROKER A DEAL.
 MY DEAL IS TOTIGATE AN
 INCIDENT, GATHER EVIDENCE AND
 GATHER FACTS AND PRESENT THEM TO
 THAT'S WHAT WE DID.
 I STAND BEHIND THE
 INVESTIGATION.
 TODAY SMOLLETT TOOK A VICTORY
 LAP AT THE COURTHOUSE.
 I HAVE BEEN TRUTHFUL ON EVERY
 LEVEL SINCE DAY ONE.
 I WOULD NOT BE MY MOTHER'S SON
  I WAS CAPABLE OF ONE DROP
 THAT I'M ACCUSED OF.
 KEEPING IN MIND RESOURCES IS
 TO COMBAT VIOLENT CRIME AND THE
 DRIVERS OF VIOLENCE.
 THE DECISIONED TO■÷ OFFER
 THIS DISPOSITION IN THE CASE.
 HIS LAWYERS EARLIER POINTING
 FINGERS AT CHICAGO POLICE.
 WE HAVE NOTHING TO SAY TO THE
 POLICE DEPARTMENT EXCEPT TO
 INVESTIGATE CHARGE AND NOT TRY
 THEIR CASES IN THE PRESS TO
 BRING CHARGES AND TO0] JUMP
 AHEAD AND UTILIZE THE PRESS TO
 CONVICT PEOPLE BEFORE THEY ARE
 TRIED IN A COURT OF LAW.
 QUITE FRANKLIN IT EVERYBODY
 OFF.
 STRONG WORDS BY
 SUPERINTENDENT ANNOUNCING
 CHARGES AGAINST SMOLLETT.
 AND WHY THIS STUNT WAS ORK
 STRAITED BECAUSE HE WAS DITS
 DISSATISFIED ABOUT HIS SALARY.
 CHICAGO'S MAYOR.
 NOT ONLY IS IT $10,000 BUT
 ALL OF THE OTHER REPERCUSSIONS
 IT MADE TO ME, WHERE IS THE
 ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE SYSTEM?
 YOU CANNOT HAVE BECAUSE OF A
 PERSON'S POSITION ONE SET OF
 RULES APPLY TO THEM AND ANOTHER
 SET OF RULES APPLY TO EVERYBODY
 ELSE.
 WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THIS IT
 GOT INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION.
 I'M TOLD THOSE TWO MEN HAVE THE
 TEXT MESSAGE EXCHANGES BETWEEN
 SMOLLETT AND THEMSELVES SO THEY
 A LOT OF QUESTIONS WITH THIS.
 NOW THAT IT'S SEALED WE PLAY
 NEVER KNOW WHAT POLICE ACTUALLY
 HAD.
 THIS IS RYAN YOUNG FOR US.
 THANKS VERY MUCH.
 WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THIS BREAKING
 NEWS COMING UP LATER IN THE
 SITUATION ROOM.
 I'LL SPEAK LATER WITH HIM.

 THE MUELLER REPORT WAS GREAT.
 IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN BETTER.
 IT SAID NO OBSTRUCTION, NO
 COLLUSION.
 IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN BETTER.
 BUT THAT'S NOT TRUE.
 WHILE ATTORNEY GENERAL SUMMARY
 DID STATE THAT THE SPECIAL
 COUNSEL FOUND THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN
 DID NOT CONSPIRE THE QUESTION OF
 OBSTRUCTION WAS LEFT TO THE
 JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND IT WAS
 BAR AND DEPUTY ATTORNEYERAL
 WHO DECIDED NOT TO PROSECUTE.■#

 REPORT.
  THEY DON'T NEED AN
 INTERPRETATION BY AN ATTORNEY
 GENERAL APOINTED FOR A
 PARTICULAR JOB TO MAKE SURE THE
 PRESIDENT IS WE NEED TO SEE THE
 REPORT.
 PRESIDENT ALSO ACCUSED
 UNSPECIFIED FORCES OF
 CONSPIREING AGAINST HIM.
 WE CANNOT LET IT EVER HAPPEN
 AGAIN.
 IT WENT VERY HIGH UP AND IT
 STARTED FAIRLY LOW BUT WITH
 INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE HIGHP
 THIS SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN TO A

 WE ISN'T ALLOW THAT TO TAKE

 PRESIDENT TRUMP'S PERSONAL TONE
 GIULIANI, THE FORMER MAYOR OF
 THANKS FOR COMING IN.
 NICE TO BE HERE.
 LET'S TALK ABOUT THE ATTORNEY
 GENERAL'S SUMMARY.
 DO YOU HAVE A COPY OVER THERE?
 I'M READY.
 THE PRESIDENT IS NOW SAYING
 THAT THE MUELLER REPORT IN HIS
 WORD IS GREAT AND THAT ROBERT
 MUELLER WHO SPENT NEARLWO
 YEARS INVESTIGATING ALL OF THIS
 ACTED HONORABLY.
 DO YOU AGREE WITH THE PRESIDENT?
 N THAT HE ACTED ON HONORABLY.
 TELL US WHY YOU WOULD HAVE TO
 DISAGREE.
 WE HAVE HAD -- YOU KNOW,
 PEOPLE SEE IT DIFFERENTLY.
 MAYBE I WAS IN THE TRENCHES
 MORE.
 I THOUGHT THAT TREATMENT OF
 MANAFORT WAS WAY OVER THE TOP.
 IT THINK IT SHOULDN'T BE
 ALLOWED.
 THEY SHOULD TAKE THEM, PUT THEM
 IN SOLITARYONFINEMENT
 BASICALLY TELLING THEM WHAT YOU
 >/LY. THEY LYINGUT.>]O SAYING H■

 PARDONS.
 I HAVE TAKEN THE SAME POSITION
 FROM DAY ONE UNTIL NOW.
 HE WAS TREATED THERE ALMOST A
 GROSSLY HORRIBLE WAY.
 AND YOU PLEADED GUILTY.
 YEAH BUT HE NEVER SAID WHAT
 THEY WANTED HIM TO SAY.
 HE GOT THAT BIG LONG SENTENCE.
 HE IS ABOUT TO GO TO JAIL FOR
 SEVEN AND A HALF YEAR.
 I'M NOT SAYING HE IS
 BLAMELESS.
 I'M TELLING YOU, HE WAS TREATED
 HORRIBLY.
 HE WAS TREATED I A WAY THAT'S
 VERY VERY DANGEROUS.
 A PROSECUTOR COMES VERY CLOSELY
 TO THAT.
 YOU PUT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF
 PRESSURE ON SOMEBODY.
 THAT'S POINT AT WHICH YOU KNOW
 I'M PUTTING TOO MUCH PRESSURE
 ON.
  MAY GHAT I WANT TO HEAR
 BUT IT MAY NOT BE TRUE.
 IF SOMEBODY WAS STEALING
 MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
 NOT FILING TAX RETURNS THE WAY
 YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO FILE,
 WOULDN'T YOU GO AFTER THAT
 INDIVIDUAL?
 OF COURSE WE WOULD.
 OF COURSE I WOULD.
 I WOULDN'T RAID HIS HOUSE.
 I WOULD NOT PUT HIM IN SOLITARY
 CONFINEMENT.
 THAT'S CRAZY.
 MOST TERRORISTS AREN'T IN
 SOLITARY CONFINEMENT.
 LET ME ASK YOU THIS --
 MAY I FINISH THE SENTENCE YOU
 TO LET ME FINISH THE SENTENCE.
 POWELL WROTE A BOOK CALLED --
 I HAVE FORGOT THE NAME OF THE
 BOOK BUT IT'S A BOOK ABOUT ABUSE
 OF POWER.
 HE WAS ONE OF THE PROSECUTORS
 WORKING.
 HE WAS HANDLING THE MANAFORT
 CASE.
 13 TIMES BACK AND FORTH THE GUY
 WAS IN SOLITARY.
 THEY CONTENDED THAT HE KNEW THAT
 THE PRESIDENT DID NOT HAVE
 MEETING WITH THAT RUSSIAN WOMAN.
 AND HE CONTENDED HE DID NOT?
 YES.
 EACH TIME THEY WOULD SAY YOU'RE
 LIE, YOU'RE LYING, YOU'RE LYING.
 WE HAPPEN TO HAVE THAT MATERIAL
 SENT TO US.
 IT WAS KIND OF A BIG DEAL AT THE
 TIME THAT IT■= HAPPENED.
 IN HIS LETTER I HAVE A COPY
 THAT HE DID INTERFERE IN THE
 U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN

 YOU NEVER DISCUSSED THAT?
 THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T
 DISAGREE RUSSIANS INTERFERED.
 WHAT HE DISAGREED WITH IS THAT
 HE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT.
 LISTEN TO WHAT THE PRESIDENT
 SAID AFTER HE MET WITH, YOU
 KNOW, WITH THE RUSSIAN LOOET
 LEADER.
 IT IS KIND OF SWITCHING.
 THE HEADLINE HERE IS --
 HOLD ON A SECOND.
 AFTER TWO YEARS OF SAYING
 COLLUSION, COLLUSION, COLLUSION
 ON THIS NETWORK THE WHOLE
 PURPOSE OF MUELLER'S.
 OF COURSE HE■> WAS.
 SIT THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT'S
 EFFORTS TO INTERFERE IN THE 2016
 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.
 THEY INVESTIGATED THAT.
 THEY CONFIRMED THAT.
 IT'S IN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
 SUMMARY OF THE MUELLER REPORT.
 IT INTRIGUED ME WHY THE
 PRESIDENT MAYBE REFUSES TO STILL
 ACCEPT THAT.
 LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID.
 LISTEN TO THIS.
 I HAVE PRESIDENT PUTIN.
 HE SAID IT'S NOT RUSSIA.
 I WILL SAY THIS, I DON SEE ANY
 REASON WHY IOULD BE.
 I MEAN THAT'S CLE THE
 WHOLE OBJECTIVE WHILE THE
 RUSSIANS INTERFERED IN THE
 PRESIDENT SHLG ELECTION.
 THE U.S. INTELLIGENCE CONCLUDED
 THEY HAD THREE GOALS.
 TO HARM ELECT BLT, HELP DONALD
 TRUMP'S ELECTION CHANCE AND
 UNDER DPTS MINE.
 WHY WON'T THE PRESIDENT ACCEPT
 WHAT HIS OWN INTELLIGENCE TELLS
 HIM?
 HE SAYS THIS IS A VERY GOOD
 REPORT AND I AGREE IT IS A VERY
 VERY GOOD SUMMARY I HAVE NO
 REASON TO BELIEVE IT.
 HE READ IT.
 HE DIDN'T OBJECT TO IT.
 IENT OVER THIS LETTER IN GREAT
 DETAIL.
 THE ONLY THING WE HAVE ANY ISSUE
 WITH IS THE SPECIAL COUNSEL
 PUNTING THE DECISION ON
 OBSTRUCTION TO THE ATTORNEY
 GENERAL.
 I THINK HE SHOULD HAVE MADE THAT
 DECISION.
 A LOT OF PEOPLE AGREE WITH
 YOU ON THAT.
 HE SHOULD HAVE MADE A SPECIFIC
 RECOMMENDATION.
 ALSO, REMEMBER, THIS ALSO
 DOES NOTRATE HIM.
 I WILL GET TO THAT IN A
 MOMENT.
 THAT'S KIND OF CLOSE TO AN
 IMPROPER STATEMENT.
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN HIS
 LETTER, THE FOUR-PAGE LETTER
 QUOTES MUELLER AS SAYING THAT
 THE INVESTIGATION I'M QUOTING
 FROM THE LETTER DID NOT
 ESTABLISH THAT MEMBER OF THE
 TRUMP CAMPAIGN COORDINATED WITH
 THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT.
 SO IS THERE AN INNOCENT
 EXPLANATION WHY SO MANY TRUMP
 ASSOCIATES WERE MEETING WITH
 RUSSIANS DURING THE CAMPA
 IT WASN'T THATR MANY -- HE
 PLEADED GUILTY.
 HI LIED ABOUT INTERACTIONS WHO
 HAD TIES TO RUSSIAN
 INTELLIGENCE.
 ALL OF THESE PEOPLE LIED ABOUT
 RUSSIAN CONTEXT.
 NONE OF THEM WENT TO THE FBI AND
 REPORTED THE CONTEXT OF THE FBI.
 AT THE TIME THAT IT■ HAPPENE.
 TIME OUT.
 ISN'T THAT SOMETHING YOU
 SHOULD TELL THE DPRFBI ABOUT?
 IF YOU BELIEVE IT WAS ABOUT
 SANCTIONS, RIGHT AND HE FAILED
 TO DISCLOSE THAT AND HE MISLEAD
 THE VICE PRESIDENT.
 IT HAD NOTHING TOITH■
 INFORM ON?=?m HILLARY.
 SO IT TOOK PLACE AFTER THE
 ELECTION.
 SO WHETHER HE TOLD THE TRUTH OR
 DIDN'T TELL THE TRUTH GOT
 NOTHING TO DO WITH?■LUSION.
 SO ONCE AGAIN MULTIPLE OFFERS TO
 ASSIST THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN DOES
 IT REGRET THAT HIS ASSOCIATES
 AFTER GETTING THOSE OFFERS NEVER
 REPORTED THOSE CONTACTS TO THE
 FBI.
 I CAN'T SAY WHETHER HE DOES
 ORC DOESN'T.
 YOU SAY WE HAVE INFORMATION THAT
 IS DAMAGING TO HILLARY CLINTON.
 THERE IS INFORMATION THAT WILL
 HELP DONALD TRUMP SHOULDN'T THEY
 NOTIFY THE FBI OF THAT?
 I WOULD SAY WHAT YOU'RE DOING
 IS MISSING THE FOREST THROUGH
 THE TREES.
 SPECIAL COUNSEL DID NOT --
 BUT --
 LET ME READ IT.

 DID IN THE CONSPIRE DESPITE
 MULTIPLE EFFORTS --
 I AGREE.
 THAT'S THE HEADLINE.
 THE HEADLINE THEY DID NOT
 CONSPIRE OR KOOR DIN FLAT.
 THE QUESTION IS WHAT ABOUT ALL
 OF THE MULTIPLE EFFORTS BY
 RUSSIAN OFFICIALS TO TRY TO MEET
 WITH THESE --
 I GUESS THEY ANTICIPATED WHAT
 IS GOING TO HAPPEN OR HAVE
 DETAILED KNOWLEDGE OF THE LAW.
 WHAT YOULD HAVE DONE IF
 DURING THE CAMPAIGN AND YOU
 WERE --
 I HAPPENED TO BE A LAWYER.
 WHAT YOULD WOULD YOU DONE IF
 A RUSSIAN SAID I WILL HELP
 THE -- WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE?
 I WOULD HAVE REPORTEDER
 BECAUSE I KNEW IT COULD BE A
 VIOLATION OF THE LAW.
 IT GETS YOU INTO A WHOLE
 DISCUSSION OF IS IT A CAMPAIGN
 CONTRIBUTION OR NOT?
 OUT OF AN EXCESS OF CAUTION, IF
 YOU CAME TO ME OR SOMEBODY ON
 THE CAMPAIGN CAME TO ME AND SAID
 ASIAN OFFICIAL OFFERED
 DIFFERENTY INFORMATION ON
 HILLARY, NOW, YOU DON'T STRICTLY
 HAVE TO DO IT.
 NOTHING ILLEGAL ABOUT REPORTING
 A CRIME.
 NUMBER TWO, THIS IS ARGUABLY A
 CRIME.
 A BIG DEBATE AS TO WHETHER OR
 NOT INFORMATION FROM A FOREIGNER
 IS A CONTRIBUTION TO THE
 CAMPAIGN.
 SOME LAWYERS SAY YES.
 SOME LAW;b;&AY NO.
  THE VUE OF IT?
 DOES IT HAVE A MONETARY VALUE?
 HELL OF A RUSH.
 NO STRICT DUTY TO REPORT.
 I GUARANTEE YOU MOST OF THESE
 PEOPLE VA HEARD ME, THEY
 WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN IT'S A
 VIOLATION OF THE LAW.
 THEY WOULD HAVE HAD NO IDEA THAT
 A FREFRM PERSON SAYS I GOT DIRTY
 INFORMATION ON TRUMP OR HILLARY
 THAT IS IT A POSSIBLE VIOLATION
 OF THE LAW.
 PLEASE, I REALLY BELIEVE IT IS A
 SMALL POINT IN LIKE OF THE FACT
 THAT FOR TWO NAR YEARS HE LIED.
 LET'S GET TO THE ISSUE OF
 ZBLP IT BEGAN BECAUSISH SHA WAS
 TRYING TO BER HE SAID RUSSIANS
 HAD INFORMATION.
 MAP IT WILL TURN OUT.
 IT MAY NOT BE CORRECT.
 DO YOU BETTER INFORMATION?
 I DO BUT I'M NOT AT LYNNERTY
 TO KIS THOSE IT LAST NIGHT.
 IT WAS THE US A TRAIL DWRANS
 THAT WED.
 I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF ANY
 HACKING M IT IS LEFT OAT TO BE
 DFRP HE WROTE AN EXPERT REPORT
 ON RUSSIA.
 HADN'T BEEN THERE FOR NINE
 YEARS.
 NOBODY TOLD THE JUDGE HE GOT
 FIRED.
 FLOEB TOLD ANYBODY AT THE
 DOSSIER SHE PAID $1.1 MILLION TO
 HAVE IT.
 LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.
 HE SAYS THIS REPORT BASED ON THE
 SUMMARY ALL OF US HAVE READ IS A
 COMPLETE AND TOTAL EXONERATION.
 THIS IS WHAT THE ATTORNEY
 GENERAL QUOTES MUELLER AS SAYING
 WHILE IT DOES NOT CONCLUDE IT
 ALSO DOES NOT EXONERATE.
 IS THE PRESIDENT FRUSTRATED BY
 THAT ONE LINE QUOTED IN THIS
 DOCUMENT?
 NO.
 I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS SAYING
 YOU READ THIS LETTER AND NEXT
 PARAGRAPH OF THE LETTER RIGHT
 AFTER THIS THIS DECISION ABOUT
 IS IT A CRIME OR IS IT ANOTHER
 CRIME WAS TO THE ATTORNEY
 GENERAL TO ROSEN STEIN.
 I UNDERSTAND ALTHOUGH I DON'T
 HAVE DETAILED KNOWLEDGE OF THIS
 THEY TOOK TWO TO THREE WEEKS.
 THREE WEEKS.
 THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT THEY GAVE
 IT TO --
 OFF OF THE LEGAL COUNSEL OR
 THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.
 THEY REVIEWED EVERY CASE ON
 OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE AND CAME
 TO THIS CONCLUSION.
 IT EXONERATES IT.
 I GUESS YOU WOULD HAVE TO SAY
 MUELLER AND BAR EXONERATED HIM
 ON COLLUSION AND THE ATTY
 OBSTRUCTION NOT MUELLER.
 MUELLER I CAN'T SAY IT'S A
 CRIME BUT I CAN'T EXONERATE.
 THIS IS ABOUT AS GOOD AS A
 DECLINATION.
 THEY SAID HE IS ON HONORABLE
 GUY.
 MAYBE THE GUY WAS CONFUSED AND
 HE PUNTED HIM.
 I HAVE A GUESS AS TO WHAT
 HAPPENED.
 I THINK HIS STAFF WAS AND AS A
 QUESTION.
 BUT YOU KNOW ROBERT MUELLER.
 YES.
 AND I SIDE FROM THE CRITICISM
 I GAVE YOU BEFORE I HAVE A GOOD
 VIEW OF HIM.
 EVERYBODY MAKES MISTAKES.
 HE WOULDN'T MAKE UP HIS OWN
 MIND?
 HE SAYS -- I MEAN I IMAGINE
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL DESCRIBED
 WHAT THE SPECIAL COUNCIL VIEWS
 AS.HERS SUGGESTED HE WAS TO
 DECIDE WHETHER THE PRESIDENT DID
 ANYTHING.
 HE STILL GOT A LAWYER NOT
 REALIZED IT WAS THE ATTORNEY
 GENERAL'S POSITION.
 SO HE DIDN'T ACTUALLY CHARGE IT
 FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.
 ALSO FROM THE IDEA HE REPORTED
 IT THREE WEEKS EARLIER I THINK
 HE NIGH THAT IT WOULD BE A
 REVIEW.
 YOU DON'T FLOW FOR SURE THAT
 MUELLER WANTED THE ATTORNEY
 GENERAL TO MAKE A FINAL
 DECISION.
 I DO THINK HE WOULD NOT HAVE
 REPORTED THREE WEEKS EAR
 YOU W THIS WHOLE MUELLER
 REPORT TO BE RELEASED WITH THE
 EXCLUSION OF SOME GRAND JURY
 TESTIMONY OR NATIONAL SECURITY
 SECRETS CLASSIFIED INFORMATION
 YOU WANT IT TO BE RELEASED WHEN?
 CONSISTENT WITH THE LAW
 KNOWING HOW LONG IT IS REPORTED
 TO BE.
 AND IF THEY WANT TO PUT OUT
 GRAND JURY MATERIAL THEY CAN GO
 TO A JUDGE AND GET IT.
 THEY MIGHT NOT GET IT BUT THEY
 CAN TRTO DO IT.
 IF THE PRESIDENT HAD NOTHING
 TO HIDE WHY WEREN'T YOU WILLING
 TO LETIM SIT DOWN FOR AN
 INTERVIEW SPECIAL COUNS>■■■■■>■
 WRITING BUT HE NEVER AGREED TO
 SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT IT.
 I DON'T WANT TO GET SUED FOR
 MALPRACTICE.
 I WOULD BE A HELD OF AN AWFUL
 LAWYER IF I WALKED HIM IN WHERE
 I HAD EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE
 THEY WEREN'T IN GOOD FAITH.
 THEY WERE GOING TO TRY TO TRAP
 HIM WITH COHEN LYING HIS WHAT
 OFF.
 I'M NOT ARGUING HE THE
 TRUTH OR DIDN'T TELL HIM.
 TH?I?I TRAPP?I■I■I■I HIM.
 THEY HAD EVERYTHING.
 THEY ASKED HIM DID YOU HAVE ANY
 MEETI
 MEETINGS.
 THEY ASKED THE QUESTION.
 HE SAID I DON'T REMEMBER A
 MEETING LIKE THAT.
 IF YOU DO THAT YOU TAKE THE MEMO
 OUT AND YOU SAY LOOK, YOU HAD A
 MEETING.
 DOES THAT REFRESH YOUR
 RECKLATR
 RECOLLECTION ABOUT THAT MEETING?
 YOU KEEP IT IN THE DESK.
 WHEN IT COMES NEXT TO THAT YOU
 SAY PERJURY.
 WE ALSO KNOW SOME OF THE FBI
 AGENTS DIDN'T THINK HE LIED
 ABOUT IT.
 I DON'T KNOW HOW IT ALL SWITCHED
 INTO CHARGING IT.
 I TAKE IT IN THE Q AND A YOU
 DIDN'T WANT THE PRESIDENT TO
 ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS INVOLVING
 OBSTRUCTION, IS THAT RIGHT?
 A COUPLE REASONS FOR THAT.
 NUMBER ONE THE PRIVILEGE THAT HE
 HAS, THE EXECUTIVE PREF LIJ THAT
 HE HAS IS MUCH STRONGER FROM THE
 DAY HE IS ELECTED PRESIDENT.
 SO JUST CONVENIENTLY DIVIDED
 INTO THE COLLUSION, ALLEGED
 COLLUSN ALL TOOK PLACE BEFORE
 HE WAS PRESIDENT.
 A PRIVATE CITIZEN.
 WE COULD HAVE MADE A CLAIM OF
 PRIVILEGE.
 OUR CHANCESO OF WINNING THAT
 WOULD BE BETTER THAN OURS.
 TON OTHER HAND FROM THE DAY HE
 BECOMES PRESIDENT AND THE DAY HE
 IS INAUGURATED IT BECOMES VERY
 STRONG.
 HE DOESN'T ONLY BECOME STRONG IT
 IS BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY DID.
 BY TURNING OVER 1.4 MILLION
 DOCUMENTS BY NOT OBJECTING TO 50
 WITNESSES, REMEMBER BILL CLINTON
 OBJECTED TO WITNESSES MADE IT
 HARDER FOR HIM TO ASSERT
 EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE.
 HE GOT INDICTED FOR PERJURY.
 THEY SAT HIM DOWN FOR AN
 INTERVIEW.
 IT IS KIND OF ON OUR MIND.
 SO I'M A LAWYER.
 I'M NOT A POLITICIAN.
 I AM A POLITICIAN.
 IN THIS ROLE I'M A LAWYER.
 MY JOB IS TO PROTECT MY CLIENT.
 IF HE WEREN'T THE PRESIDENT OF
 THE UNITED STATES THERE WOULD BE
 NO CONSIDERATION AT ALL.
 MOST PEOPLE UNDER INVESTIGATION
 DO NOT GO INTO A GRAND JURY OR
 TESTIFY UNDER OATH.
 EVERY ONE I MADE I DIDN'T HAVE
 THE BENEFIT.
 AND YOU CAN RELAEASE ON YOUR
 OWN Q AND A WHAT HE DID WITH
 MUELLER.
 WHEN YOU RELEASE IT ASSUMING
 THEY DON'T WANT TO RELEASE IT DO
 YOU A PROBLEM RELEASING THAT?
 THE ANSWERS ARE ALL TRUTHFUL
 OTHERWISE YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN
 IT.
 WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE SEEN
 WHAT THE SPECIAL COUNSEL ASKS
 AND WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID.
 I ASSUME YOU WORKED REALLY HARD
 TO WRITE THE ANSWERS.
 HE GAVE THE ANSWERS AND WE
 WORKED REALLY HARD TO MAKE SURE
 HIS RECOLLECTION WAS CORRECT.
 YOU LOOKED AT THE DOCUMENTS YOU
 HAVE TO LOOK AT WHICH WOULDN'T
 HAVE HAPPENED IN A SITUATION
 WHERE THEY ARE TRYING TO TRAP
 IT.
 AND SO YOU CAN ASSURE US?
 I HAVE NO IDEA.
 BUT UP TO YOU YOU WOULD
 RELEASE IT?
 NOTHING IN THERE I HAVE ANY
 PROBLEM WITH.
 I THINK YOU KNOW MOST OF THE
 ANSWERS THAT ARE IN THERE.
 WE WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED SM.
 NO SURPRISE.
 HOW MANY PAGES WAS IT?
 THE QUESTIONS WERE ABOUT
 RECOLLECTION NOW BACK THEN SEVEN
 OR EIGHT PAGES OF QUESTIONS.
 THEY HAD A TOPIC AND THEN HAD
 EIGHT SUB QUESTIONS.
 THEN OUR ANSWERS THEN GO IN
 SEQUENCE WITH THOSE.
 SO MAYBE OUR WE VENN CLUL
 ANSWERS AT 15O 20 PAGES.
 YOU TOLD MY COLLEAGUE YOU
 HAVE A 97 PAGE REBUTTAL READY TO
 BE RELEASED.

 CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE OF
 WHAT IS THERE T REPORT?
 YEAH.
 LET'S TALK ABOUT OBSTRUCTION.
 IT GOES ON -- IT GOES INTO WHY
 THIS COULD NOT BE AN OBSTRUCTION
 ON MANY DIFFERENT LEVELS.
 ONE OF THE THINGS THE ATTORNEY
 GENERAL PICKS UP ON THERE WAS NO
 UNDERLYING CRIME BY EXONERATING
 HIM ON COLLUSION IT TURNS OUT
 THEY ARE NOT --
 PEOPLE GO TO JAIL EVEN THOUGH
 THEY DIDN'T COMMIT A CRIME.
 YOU LIED ABOUT IT.
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAYS IT
 IS HARD TO FIND INTENT.
 YOU CAN.
 SHE DIDN'T ENGAGE THERE
 INSIDER TRADING BUT SHE WOUND UP
 IN JAIL BECAUSE SHE LIED ABOUT
 IT.
 ALTHOUGH THERE WAS A VERY
 CLOSE CASE INVOLVING MARTHA
 STEWART, A QUESTION OF FACT AS
 WHO WAS TELLING THE TRUTH AND
 WHO WASN'T.
 IN THIS CASE THERE IS NO CASE OF
 COLLUS
 COLLUSION.
 THAT'S NOT THE ONLY THING.
 SECOND, THERE IS NONE OF THE
 THINGS THAT YOU USUALLY HAVE
 WITH AN OBSTRUCTION CASE.
 LET'S TAKE THE FLYNN SITUATION
 WHICH HE SAYS DIDN'T TAKE PLACE.
 IF YOU TAKE HIS TESTIMONY HE
 SAYS THE PRESIDENT SAID TO ME GO
 EASY ON FLYNN.
 THAT'S OBSTRUCTION.
 I NEVER HEARD OF OBSTRUCTION
 CASE.
 I THINK IT BEGAN WITH PLEAS.
 YOU NEVER START WITH PLEAS.
 IT STARTS WITH TAKE YOUR MONEY
 AWAY.
 SOME THREAT INVOLVED IN IT.
 SOME KIND OF COERCION.
 FINALLY IT COULDN'T BE
 OBSTRUCTION BECAUSE ASSUMING HE
 IS TELLING THE TRUTH, SO WHAT
 HAPPENED THERE MAY YOU FIGURED
 OUT HE WAS OBSTRUCTED IN
 FEBRUARY.
 I'M GOING TO REPORT IT TO THE
 FBI?
 I THINK WE WILL KILL THAT
 OBSTRUCTION THEORY.
 WERE YOU SURPRISED?
 I DESCRIBE IT AS A VERY VERY
 OFFICIAL LEGAL TERM.
 I DESCRIBE IT AS A LEGAL THEORY
 OF OBSTRUCTION.
 WERE YOU SURPRISED MUELLER
 AND HIS TEAM DIDN'T SUBPOENA THE
 PRESIDENT TO SEEK AN ORAL B
 INTERVIEW?
 YOU WERE BRACING FOR THAT
 RIGHT?
 WE COULD HAVE.■v I TOLD YOU,
 OBSTRUCTION PART AFTER HE WAS
 PRESIDENT I THINK WE HAD THE
 BETTER ARGUMENT.
 I THINK WE WOULD HAVE WON THAT
 BATTLE PARTICULARLY BECAUSE WE
 HAD SO MUCH INFORMATION.
 WHAT YOU TO SHOW FLORD GET ■A
 PRESIDENT'S TESTIMONY HE TRIED
 TO RESIST THE SUBPOENA.
 HE LOST.
 THE COURT SAID YOU HAVE TO SHOW
 IF YOU WANT TO SUBPOENA A
 PRESIDENT THAT YOU CAN'T GET
 THIS INFORMATION ANY OTHER WAY.
 WE WERE PRETTY CONFIDENT
 WHATEVSTIONSY WANTED ■@■@■@HEY
 INFORMATION WHICH IS ALSO WHY
 THEY SUSPECTED THEY WERE TRYING
 TO TRAP HIM IN THE PERJURY.
 WE DIDN'T NEED HIS EXPLANATIONS.
 WHY DID HE FIRE COMEY?
 HE GAVE ALL OF THE REASONS.
 HE IS GOING TO REPEAT IT.
 LET ME MENTION RUSSIA?
NO QUESTION RUSSIA HAD
 SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT.
 THERE WERE EIGHT OTHER REASONS
 CHLS THAT ALL HE NEEDS.
 HE HAD VERY VERY GOOD REASONS TO
 FIRE HIM.
 HILLARY WOULD HAVE FIRED THE GUY
 I THINK.
 WELL, HILLARY WOULD HAVE
 FIRED HIM FOR OTHER REASONS.
 COCOMEY DID NOT COVER
 HIMSELF.
 I HIRED JIM COMEY.
 YEAH.
 I DON'T FLOW WHAT HAPPENED TO
 HIM.
 HE DID NOT COVER HIMSELF WITH
 GLORY MANY THIS PARTICULAR CASE.
 WHAT HE DID TO HILLARY CLINTON
 IS WRONG.
 YOU DON'T SAY I'M NOT GOING TO
 INDICT AND THEN SAY ALL OF THE
 BAD THINGS ABOUT SOMEBODY AND
 YOU DON'T SAY I'M NOT GOING TO
 INDICT BUT SAY I CAN'T
 EXONERATE.
 WAS THERE --
 THAT'S A CLHEAP SHOT.
 WAS THERE EVER A THOUGHT THAT
 MUELLER WAS GOING TO ASK HIM TO
 TESTIFY?
 NO.
 THERE WAS NEVER -- THAT NEVER
 CAME UP.
 SO WE NEVER FACED THE SITUATION.
 WHAT DID HAPPEN PERSISTENTLY,
 AND YOU HEARD SOME OF THESE,
 THERE WERE RUMORS AND THEN WE
 CHECK AND YOU GET ONE ABOUT
 THREE OR FOUR WEEKS.
 I ALWAYS THOUGHT THEY WERE TO
 GET THE PRESIDENT ANGRY.
 I CAN TELL YOU THE PRESIDENT
 HANDLED THE STUFF AGAINST HIM
 REALLY WELL.
 THE PRESIDENT WOULD GET UPSET
 WHEN IT INVOLVED HIS FAMILY OR
 SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT WORKED
 FOR HIM OR SOME OF THE KIDS LIKE
 SOME OF THESE PEOPLE YOU SEE ON
 TELEVISION HAD TO SPEND AN
 ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY.
 AND IN THAT TRUMP TOWER
 MEETING IN JUNE OF 2016 WHEN
 THEY MET WITH THIS RUSSIAN THAT
 SUPPOSEDLY.
 HE SAID GREAT.
 WE'LL TAKE IT.
 JARED WAS IN ABOUT HALF OF
 THE MEETING.
 WERE YOU SURPRISED HAY DIDN'T
 CALL ON THEM TO AT LEAST ANSWER
 QUESTIONS?
 I'M NOT SURPRISED BECAUSE I
 THINK FROM THE PEOPLE ON THE
 OTHER SIDE OF THAT MEETING I
 DON'T THINK THEY EVER DISCUSSED
 HILLARY CLINTON.
 SO IT GOT SET UP THAT WAY BUT IT
 REALLY WAS A PRETEXT TO TALK
 ABOUT ADOPTIONS AND ADOPTIONS
 FROM RUSSIA AND SO EVERYBODY
 KIND OF WALKED OUT ON■P■  IT.
 YOUR THOUGHTS ON GRAHAM
 SAYING IT WAS HIS IDEA TO HAND
 OVER THE DOSSIER TO THE FBI.
 YOU HE SAY IT A LITTLE
 WHILE AGO.
 THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN REALLY
 RAILING AGAINST THE LATE SENATOR
 JOHN McCAIN BLAMING HIM FOR THIS
 WHOLE THING.
 GRAHAM SAYS I SUGGESTED TO H
 HIMTH
 HIM THERE'S A LOT OF DIRT IN
 THERE.
 I HAVEN'T READ ALL OF IT.
 I READ A LOT OF WHAT'S IN THERE.
 I DON'T KNOW IF HE SAW IT.
 HE MAY HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED TO
 HIM.
 I THINK HE HAS A PROFESSIONAL
 LAWYER WOULD REALIZE IT'S A
 PIECE OF GARBAGE.
 IT'S A SILLY DOCUMENT.
 IT'S NOT A WELL WRITTEN
 INTELLIGENCE DOCUMENT.
 IT IS OBVIOUSLY -- IT LOOKS LIKE
 A BIG LONG NATIONAL INQUIRER
 ARTICLE.
 IT DOESN'T SEEM TO COME FROM AN
 INTEL
 INTELLIGENCE PROFESSIONAL.
 THE RUSSIANS MADE HIM AN AGENT
 TEN YEARS AGO AND DECIDED FIVE
 YEARS AGO HE WOULD BE PRESIDENT.
 IF THEY COULD FIGUR OUT HE
 WOULD BE PRESIDENT THEY WILL BE
 IN A LOT OF TROUBLE.
 THEY ARE A LOT SMARTER THAN THEY
 THINK THEY ARE.
 AND OTHER --
 THERE IS ALSO ANOTHER THING
 THEY DID WITH THAT THAT'S REALLY
 THERE'S A SPECIFIC ALLEGATION IN
 THERE THAT MICHAEL COHEN WENT TO
 GET INFORMATION FOR THE
 RUSSIANS.
 YEAH.
 ALL YOU TO DO IS THE DATE.
 CALL THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND
 FIND OUT WHAT DOES THIS PASSPORT
 SAY?
 THEY ARE DOING THIS
 EXTRAORDINARY ACT.
 A MAN TURNS OUT TO BE INNOCENT.
 THEY DON'T EVEN BOTHER TO CHECK
 THE ONE THING.
 YOU KNOW TO SOUTHERN DISTRICT
 OF NEW YORK.
 YOU ONCE WERE THE U.S. ATTORNEY,
 THEY ARE PRETTY AGGRESS IFR.
 HOW WORRIED ARE YOU THAT THE
 MUELLER INFORMATION 22 MONTHS IS
 OVER WITH NOW BUT THEIR
 INVESTIGATION FROM SOME FROM
 SOME PERSPECTIVE IS ONLY JUST
 BEGINNING.
 IT HAS BEEN GOING ON BEFORE
 THE SUMMER.
 I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT IT AT
 ALL.
 THERE'S NO VIOLATION OF THE LAW.
 WHEN YOU MAKE PAYMENTS TO SETTLE
 PERSONAL CLAIM AND FEEVEN IF IT
 HELPS IT CAN'T POSSIBLY BE A
 CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION.
 IT IS A VERY FAULTY LEGAL
 THEORY.
 THEY SITED IT AS A CAMPAIGN
 CONTRIBUTION, THE MONEY THAT WAS
 GIVEN.
 LET THEM TRY TO INCITE
 SOMEBODY.
 THE COURT WILL THROW IT OUT.
 HE PLEADED GUILTY.
 IF IT CAN BE CONSIDERED A
 CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION THECHB I
 CAN RUN FOR OFFICE NOW.
 I CAN SETTLE EVERY CASE AGAINST
 ME AND USE MY DONORS MONEY TO DO
 IT AND THEY WOULD PUT ME IN
 JAIL.
 THAT'S THE THEORY THEY HAVE AND
 IT WILL FALL DOWN.
 YOU NOTICED IN THAT DOCUMENT, IN
 THAT CHARGE AGAINST MICHAEL
 COHEN AND THE JUDGE ACCEPTED IT
 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
 STATES IS IDENTIFIED AS
 INDIVIDUAL NUMBER ONE.
 WHETHER IT IS OR ISN'T IT'S
 NOT A CRIME.
 IF IT'S A CRIME THEN WE HAVE 30
 PLUS MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHO
 OVER THE LAST SEVER YEARS HAVE
 HAD CLAI CLAIMS OF SEXUAL HARAS.
 DID THE PRESIDENT DO THAT?
 WHAT?
 WORK TO PAY OFF --
 I'M NOT SAYING HE DID.
 I'M TELLING YOU IF THEY TRY TO
 ALLEGE THAT AS A CRIME IT IS IN
 THE A CRIME.
 HE WOULD HAVE A WEIRD SUCH WAYS
 PEOPLE WOULD RUN TO CLEAN OUT
 ALL OF THE CLIMBS AGAINST HIM
 AND USE DONORS MONEY TO DO THAT.
 IT WOULD BE AN ABACCIDENT
 OCCURRED ABSURD APPLICATION.
 AND YOU KNOW THE ATTORNEY
 GENERAL, YOUR HOME STATEOVER NEW
 YORK, THE STATE ATTORNEY
 GENERAL, INVESTIGATING AND
 SHE IS INVESTIGATING.
 SHE RAN ON THE PLATFORM THAT
 I'M GOING TO INVESTIGATE DONALD
 TRUMP AND I'M GOING TO GET HIM
 FOR SOMETHING.
 VERY CREDIBLE.
 SO YOU'RE NOT WORRIED
 ABOUT --
 SHE IS LOOKING AT THE
 FOUNDATION.
 HE PAID OUT 19 MILLION AND HE
 RAISED ONLY 18 MILLION.
 HE DONATED ABOUT 18 MILLION OF
 HIS OWN MINUTE.
 THERE'S NOT A SINGLE CLAIM THAT
 NOBODY WAS PAID.
 NO BIG SALARIES.
 NO TRIPS PAID FOR.
 NO PERKS, NOT $150 MILLION
 CONTRIBUTION FROM RUSSIA LIKEE .
 I DON'T THINK THERE'S A PROBLEM.
 ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT
 INVESTIGATING THE TRUMP
 ORGANIZATION?
 NO BECAUSE I THINK THE TRUMP
 ORGANIZATION IS CLEAN.
 IT'S A CLEAN ORGANIZATION.
 SHEER WHAT I REALLY WORRY ABOUT
 AS A CITIZEN.
 THIS IS LIKE SAYING I'M GOING TO
 GO BACK IN THIS MAN'S LIFER I'M
 GOING TO GO BACK AND FIND
 SOMETHING HE DID WRONG.
 SO I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IS THAT
 GOING GO■á ON?
 ARE YOU GOING TO STICK AROUND
 AND CONTINUE THIS?
 WHAT'S THE NEXT CLAP TER.
 I DO A LOT OF OTHER THINGS.
 I RUN A SECURITY BUSINESS AND WE
 DO SECURITY CONSULTING.
 I HEARD ON STRATEGISTS THAT
 SAY HE DOESN'T THINK IT IS WISE
 TO PURSUE IMPEACHMENTS.
 JIM IS IN THE HOUSE --
 SAY THAT --
 HE SAID WE HAVE TO MOVE ON
 THIS CHAPTER IS OVER WITH.
 SHE HAD THE RIGHT STANDARD
 POLITICALLY WHICH IS YOU HAVE TO
 HAVE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT.
 IF YOU DON'T IT WILL LOOK LIKE A
 COMPLETELY POLITICAL WITCH HUNT.
 I DON'T THINK YOU'LL GET
 BIPARTISAN SUPPORT BASED ON
 THIS.
 I HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA FOR
 THE REST OF WHAT THEY HAVE.
 LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING A
 FULL REPORT.
 IF ANYTHING IS ELD BACK I
 KNOW SOMEONE WILL SAY OH, MY
 GOD.
 I WOULD LIKE THE WHOLE TLING
 TO BE OUT.
 I'M SURE THE PRESIDENT IS
 GRATEFUL FOR YOU.
 I'M GRATEFUL THAT HOWEVER
 THEY GOT THERE WRONG OR NOT
 WRONG I'M GRATEFUL THAT AN
 INNOCENT MAN WAS, YOU KNOW,
 VINDICATED.
 AND YOU'RE ALWAYS WELCOME TO
 COME BACK INTO OUR SITUATION
 ROOM.
 HAVE YOU BEEN TO THE WHITE HOUSE
 SITUATION ROOM?
 YEAH.
 I WAS IN RE BEGAN
 ADMINISTRATION.
 I GO WAY BACK ALMOST AS OLD AS
 YOU.
■R MAYBE.
 THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING
 OUT.
 APPRECIATE IT.
 THANK YOU.
 WE'LL HAVE A LOT MORE COMING
 UP RIGHT AFTER THIS.

    If you have postmenopausal    osteoporosis
   and a high risk for fracture
  now might not be the best time  to ask yourself
       are my bones strong?
  Life is full of make-or-break  moments.
   That's why it's so importantçT
 and protect bones from fracture with 1 shot every 6 months.
 Do not take Prolia® if you have low blood calcium, are pregnant,
   are allergic to it, or take   XGEVA®.
   Serious allergic reactions,
 like low blood pressure; trouble breathing;
 throat tightness; face, lip, or tongue swelling;
   rash; itching; or hives have   happened.
  Tell your doctor about denta■■■
 as severe jaw bone problems may happen
  or new or unusual pain in your  hip groin, or thigh,
 as unusual thigh bone fractures urred.
   Speak to your doctor before   stopping Prolia®
     as spine and other bone     fractures have occurred.
  Prolia® can cause serious side  effects,
 like low blood calcium, serious infections,

          Are you ready?
 Ask your doctor how Prolia® can help strengthen your bones.
 JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SAID IT WILL TAKE WEEKS FOR BILL BARR TO
 MAKE A VERSION OF THE MUELLER
 REPORT AVAILABLE.
 I JUST SPOKE AT LENG WITH RUDY
 GIULIANI.
 WE HAVE A LOT TO DISCUSS.
 SUSAN, LET ME GET YOUR THOUGHTS
 ON WHAT WE JUST HEARD FROM THE
 MAYOR.
 IT IS DIFFICULT SO PARSE IT
 ALL OUT.
 AGAIN, THE BAR SUMMARY IS NOT
 THE MUELLER REPORT.
 APPARENTLY THE WHITE HOUSE HAS
 NOT REVIEWED THE MUELLER REPORT
 FOR THEMSELVES SO THEY ARE
 MAKING -- OPERATING WITH SAME
 INFORMATION WE ARE.
 IN IT DOES NOT EXONERATE THE
 PRESIDENT OR ANSWER SERIOUS
 QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS CAMPAIGN'S
 CONDUCT.
 IT IS INTERESTING THAT JEWGIULI
 ADMITTED HAD A RUSSIAN
 INDIVIDUAL REACHED OUT THAT HE
 WOULD HAVE BEEN INCLINED TO
 CONTACT THE FBI.
 I THINK IT GOES TO ONE OF THE
 CORE QUESTIONS HERE WHICH IS
 ROBERT MUELLER HAS NOW ANSWERED
 THE QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER OR
 NOT ANY CRIMINAL CONDUCT
 OCCURRED.
 I DOESN'T MEAN THAT UNACCEPTABLE
 NOW WE'LL HAVE TO DECIDE IF WHAT
 THE PRESIDENT DID WAS ACCEPTABLE
 OR NOT.
 ZB HE SAID HE WANTS EVERYTHING

 RELEASED.
 HE SAID IMPLIED YOU
 RELEASE GRAND JURY TESTIMONY IF
 YOU GET A JUDGE TO SAY OKAY.
 WHAT WAS
 HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE WRITTEN
 QUESTIONS AND HOW THERE WERE
 MULTIPLE PAGES, SEVEN OR EIGHT
 OR WHATEVER IT WAS WITH SUB
 TEXT.
 WHEN YOU ASKED HIM WHY DIDN'T
 YOU HAVE THE PRESIDENT TESTIFY
 IF HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH, HE
 SAID IT WOULD BE MALPRACTICE.
 AND THAT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING OF
 WHAT THE LAWYERS■& SAYING.
 WHICH THEY WOULD LAY THEMSELVES
 DOWN IN FRONT OF A BUS BEFORE
 THEY'D LET DONALD TRUMP TESTIFY.
 BUT I MUST SAY THIS IS SORT OF
 THE FOR ME IN HEARING RUDY
 GIULIANI, IT'S THE CALMEST I
 HAVE EVER HEARD HIM ABOUT THIS
 ENTIRE CASE BECAUSE THE RELIEF
 IS PALPABLE FOR HIM.
 I DO BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT IS
 MISCHARACTERIZED THE
 EXONERATION, OR SO-CALLED
 EXONERATION OR ON OBSTRUCTION,
 WHICH THERE WAS NONE, BUT YOU
 CAN SEE THAT THE RELIEF IS
 THERE.
 AND THAT HE SAYS YET AGAIN, PUT
 EVERYTHING OUT THERE.
 IF HE'S SAYING PUT EVERYTHING
 OUT THERE AND THE CONGRESS IS
 SAYING PUT EVERYTHING OUT THERE
 AND THE PRESIDENT IS SAYING PUT
 VRG OUT THERE, WHY NOT?
 WHAT DO YOU THINK?
 I THINK THE RELIEF COULD BE
 SHORT LIVED.
 THE MUELLER REPORT, AS WE
 UNDERSTAND IT, TO THE DEGREE
 THAT IF FOUND THERE WAS NO
 INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL CONSPIRACY
 BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND
 THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT, THE
 PRESIDENT IS CLEAR.
 BUT AS SUSAN POINTED OUT, WHAT
 WE DON'T KNOW IS THE EXTENT TO
 WHICH INDIVIDUALS ON THE TRUMP
 CAMPAIGNEN ENGAGED IN ACTIVITIES
 WITH RUSSIAN OFFICIALS THAT MAY
 NOT HAVE RISEN TO THE LEVEL OF
 CRIMINALITY, BUT STILL
 COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE.
 SO THAT'S A QUESTION THAT MUST
 BE ANSWERED.
 WE HAVE AN ISSUE OF OBSTRUCTION
 OF JUSTICE.
 WE DON'T KNOW THAT THE PRESIDENT
 NEVER OBSTRUCTED JUSTICE IS
 BASED ON PREEXISTING NOTION■  TT
 A PRESIDENT CAN'T BE GUILTY OR
 IF IT WAS BASED ON A WELCOME OF
 EVIDENCE AND ONLY THE REPORT
 WILL HELP US UNDERSTAND THAT.
 THE MAYOR RUDY GIULIANI SAID
 HE WOULD BE FINE RELEASING THE
 WRITTEN Q&A THE PRESIDENT
 ENGAGED IN WITH ROBERT MUELLER.
 HE WOULDN'T HAVE IS A PROBLEM.
 HE SAID HE WANTS IT ALL OUT
 THERE.
 WHAT'S INTERESTING IS HIS
 CHARACTER RAIGS.
 THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED IF HE
 THOUGHT HE WAS AN HONORABLE MAN
 AND HE SAID YES.
 RUDY GIULIANI SAID HE DISAGREED
 WITH THE PRESIDENT AND SAID HE
 WASN'T HONORABLE AT LEAST IN HOW
 HE HANDLED THIS INVESTIGATION.
 AND ALSO I THOUGHT IT WAS
 STRIKING THAT HE SAID THAT
 ROBERT MUELLER MAY HAVE BEEN
 CONFUSED WHEN TRY ING TO DECIDE
 ON WHETHER THE PRESIDENT
 OBSTRUCTED JUSTICE AND THAT'S
 WHY IN HIS WORDS HE PUNTED.
 AND THEN HE REALLY DID GO AFTER
 PROSECUTION AS WELL.
 SOME OF THE OTHER PROSECUTORS
 THERE, CALLING HIM MUELLER'S
 HENCHMAN AND THEN THE OTHER
 THING THAT STRUCK ME WAS WHEN
 YOU ASKED ABOUT A PARDON FOR
 MANAFORT AND HE MAY HAVE
 COMMITTED A CRIME BUT DOESN'T DO
 SOMETHING SO EGREGIOUS TO BE
 TREATED THE WAY HE WAS.
 IT'S INTERESTING.
 THE FULL ISSUE OF PARDONS, HE
 SAID MANAFORT WAS TREATED
 UNFAIRLY BY THE SPECIAL COUNSEL
 AND MICHAEL FLYNN, THE FORMER
 NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER WAS
 BADLY TREATED AS WELL.
 BUT HE SAID■ WE HAVEN'T
 DISCUSSED PARDONS.
  M
 IT'S THE COUNSEL'S JOB IN THE
 WHITE HOUSE.
 HE'S RIGHT ABOUT THAT.
 BUT WHAT WAS INTERESTING TO ME
 IS IT'S CLEAR THAT WHAT STICKS
 IN THE PRESIDENT'S CRAW AND RUDY
 GIULIANI IS IS THE LINE THAT
 SAYS THAT WE CAN'T CONCLUDE THE
 PRESIDENT COMMITTED A CRIME, BUT
 IT DOES NOT EXONERATE HIM.
 IT'S CLEAR THAT RUDY GIULIANI
 BELIEVES THE SECOND PART OF THAT
 WAS SOMETHING THAT A SPECIAL
 COUNSEL SHOULD NOT SAY BECAUSE
 IF YOU CAN'T PROVE IT, YOU
 SHOULDN'T SAY HE'S NOT
 EXONERATED.
 THE MAYOR SAID THAT WHEN THE
 SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER
 COULDN A FINAL DECISION
 ON THE WHOLE ISSUE OF
 OBSTRUCTION HE WAS HANDING IT
 OVER TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO
 MAKE THAT DECISION.
 SO ONCE AGAIN, WE DON'T KNOW
 THAT'S WHAT ROBERT MUELLER
 INTENDED AT ALL UNTIL WE SEE
 THAT UNDERLYING REPORT.
 ROBERT MUELLER SAID, THIS DOES
 NOT EXONERATE HIM.
 THAT SOUNDS LIKE HE'S PRESENT
 ING THE LEGAL ARGUMENTS ON BOTH
 SIDES.
 AND HE'S GOING TO LEAVE THAT FOR
 CONGRESS TO DECIDE.
 I THINK WHEN WE'RE SEEING IS THE
 WHITE HOUSE STRATEGY THAT
 BETWEEN THE BARR SUMMARY AND
 MUELLER REPORT TO CAPITALIZE ON
 THE CHAOS AND CONFUSION IS AND
 THROW AS MUCH SAND AS POSSIBLE
 IN HOPING A TO GET A NARRATIVE
 THAT WILL STICK.
 IT'S POSSIBLE ALSO THAT THERE
 WAS SOME DISAGREEMENT AMONG THE
 LAWYERS WORKING FOR MUELLER.
 AND THAT THEY HAD A DIFFICULT
 TIME CLEARLY, REACHING SOME KIND
 OF DECISION.
 HE DID PUNT IT.
 NOW WHETHER HE EXPECTED BARR TO
 MAKE THAT DECISION OR NOT
 REMAINS TO BE SEEN.
 WE'LL HAVE A LOT MORE ON THIS
 COMING UP.
  HAVE TO TAKE ANOTHER QUICK
 BREAK.

          Minor accident       —no big deal, right?
      Wrong. Your insurance      company is gonna raise
    your rate after the other    car got a scratch so small
         you coulda fixed          it with a pen.
    Maybe you should take that    pen and use it to sign up
         with a different        insurance company.
