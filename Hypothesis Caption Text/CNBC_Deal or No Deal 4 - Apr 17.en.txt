- That's all for you, buddy. 
- Whoo. 
- Thank you. 
- That's all for you. 
- Thank you. It's crazy. [applause] 
- You know, first of all, that tape is incredibly moving, and, you know, we talk about heroic deeds, but you actually lived it and did it. And that woman is alive because of you. Do you stay in contact with her? 
- Oh, yes. 
- Have you seen her? 
- Every day we keep in touch. 
- Where is she? 
- She's from Canada. Actually, check this out. 
- What are these? 
- Boom. 
- Canada. That's the Canadian flag. [applause] I love that. You just made me homesick. [laughter] 
- So, these are actually from Jan. She sent them from-
- 
- The woman whose life you saved. 
- Yes, sent them. These are my lucky charms. I got lucky enough to save her, and I can't wait to call her and say hi. 
- She's in your socks. 
- She got into the socks, love the socks. [laughs] 
- So, you haven't had a chance to see her-
- 
- I have--I haven't seen her since the hospital. 
- But that is wonderful. So, you are truly a hero-
- 
- Thank you. 
- You deserve... 
- Thanks. 
- A life-changing amount of money. Tell me more about yourself, like what do you do? I know you're a hero, but what do you do... 
- I grew up in a really small town called, Minden, Nevada. With--we have a whole six stoplights. And now I'm in Vegas, and I'm a loan officer. I'm 26 and hoping to win a whole bunch of money and have fun with you guys. [cheers and applause] 
- That is so great. Are you in a relationship? Are you married? 
- I'm not married; I'm good right now. So, hey, ladies. [chuckles] 
- [laughing] [applause] Ready to start now? 
- I'm ready. 
- Okay, let's do it. 
- Let's play. [cheers and applause] 
- So, each of those ladies is holding a case. Each case has a different amount of money in it, from $1 million... 
- Whoo. [cheers and applause] 
- All the way down to the penny. 
- All right. 
- Now, we don't know what case is holding what amount. They were all packed randomly by a third party. We don't know where that $1 million is. Do you think you know? 
- Oh, I got it. I got my case picked out right now. 
- Go ahead, pick a case. 
- Number 19. 
- Okay. Natasha. Natasha. [cheers and applause] <i> [Music] [Music]</i> 
- Thank you. 
- Whoo. Thanks. 
- I'm from Vegas. 
- Oh, okay. 
- So, God bless you. 
- Thank you, nice to meet you. 
- Oh, wow. Is there a reason you chose 19? [cheers and applause] 
- Last three times I have been to Chinese food and gotten a fortune cookie... 
- Right. 
- This number has been on all of them. So, it's a sign. It's gotta be a sign. 
- Could be a sign. 
- [laughs] 
- So, let's find out if your fortune cookies were right by opening those cases. What's ever in those cases is not in your case. We will start by opening up six cases. 
- Number 16. [cheers and applause] 
- Jessica Lee, open your case. <i> [Music] [Music]</i> 
- Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo. 
- That's good, five more.

- Number 9, that's Patricia. Last one, open your case. Left side. <i> [Music] [Music]</i> [cheers and applause] 
- Yes. 
- Five tiny amounts, one big amount. Everybody wants you to walk out of here with as much money as possible. They want that to be the $1 million case. 
- It'll be it. That's it. 
- There is one person in this room that does not want that for you, and that is that lady up there. She's about to call with her offer to buy your case and send you home right now. <i> [Music] [Music]</i> Hello. <i> [Music] [Music]</i> Okay. She says she truly respects your heroism. [cheers and applause] 
- Thank you. Thank you. 
- But this is business. So, your first offer... Is $15,000. [audience booing] Listen, this is Deal Or No Deal 2.0. It's a little different than the original Deal Or No Deal. There is one little twist and that is the contestant, you, have the opportunity to negotiate. 
- Ooh. 
- Once in the game you could present the banker with a counteroffer. You only can do that once, and if she turns down that offer, you gotta play on. So, I am going to ask you right now... 
- Ooh. 
- Justin Uhart, deal or no deal? [audience exclaiming] 
- Well... Hold on, hold on, hold on. 15,000, that's a lot of money. 
- Yeah. 
- But it's so early in the game, so I'm gonna say it right now... No deal. 
- No deal! Five cases to open! We will continue with our hero when we come back. <i> [exciting music]</i> SARAH'S LAST TUITION PAYMENT, SENT OFF. FEELING GOOD? OH YEAH.

IT ISN'T. IT'S THE MOST WONDERFUL LIFE ON EARTH. I can just suck up my endometriosis pain... Or I can... IT'S THE MOST WONDERFUL LIFE ON EARTH. I can keep apologizing... Or I can... I can hope my pain gets better on its own... Or I can talk to my gynecologist today! You didn't choose to have endometriosis... but you can choose to ask if ORILISSA is right for you. ORILISSA is specifically developed for women with moderate to severe endometriosis pain. In clinical trials, ORILISSA was proven to reduce 3 common types of endometriosis pain, painful periods, pelvic pain in between periods, and pain with sex. Don't use ORILISSA if you are or may be pregnant, have osteoporosis, severe liver disease, or are taking drugs like cyclosporine or gemfibrozil. It may cause abnormal liver tests. ORILISSA may change your periods, making it hard to know if you are pregnant. It does not prevent pregnancy. Use birth control that does not contain hormones. ORILISSA may cause suicidal thoughts or actions. It may also cause bone loss. Ask your gynecologist if ORILISSA is right for you. ORILISSA. Made for endo pain. <i> [exciting music]</i> [cheers and applause] 
- Hey, welcome back to Deal Or No Deal. I'm Howie Mandel and this is Justin Uhart. 
- Hey. 
- This young man is our Vegas hero. I can't get over how heroic you are and how composed you are. You said you chose this case, you believe this is the $1 million-dollar case because of numbers you read in fortune cookies. 
- Fortune cookies, yeah, three. 
- Three fortune cookies. 
- Yeah, absolutely. 
- All right. You have five cases to open. 
- All righty. Number four. 
- Number four. Brenda, open your case. 
- Nice and low. We're gonna keep that going.

- Ooh. [chuckles] 
- You always get this nervous when a lady calls? 
- It depends if they're that pretty. [laughs] 
- She might be very pretty. Hello. <i> [Music] [Music]</i> She said she refuses to lose to someone who is basing their entire strategy on fortune cookies. [laughter] [applause] All right. How old are you again? This is the beginning of a career. So, money now would mean more... 
- Setting up my future. 
- It really is. 
- I want a home. 
- So, I'm gonna tell you something... The offer is $33,000. Yeah. 
- It went up. 
- Right, you said buy a home, is that something you wanna do? 
- I do. 
- This could get you a home. 
- It would be a down payment, yeah. 
- So, this is a big decision, isn't it? 
- It's getting more and more. 
- Well, talk about more and more, it's not just you. You have brought supporters with you, too, haven't you? 
- The best supporters. 
- Well, let's meet them. [cheers and applause] 
- You are? 
- Howdy. 
- Howdy. 
- It's great to be here, man. Glad to finally meet you. 
- It's good to meet you. Love your hair. 
- Likewise, thank you. So, I've known Justin for the last two years, but I feel like I've known him my whole life. As a Marine I was trained to do the things that he did. 
- Yeah. 
- And he did 'em. So, I'm just proud to call him my friend and, honestly, a brother. 
- Whoo! All right, all right. 
- And you are? 
- Hey, Howie, I'm Johnny. 
- Hi, Johnny. 
- Nice to meet you. I'm Justin's middle school buddy. We've been best friends for life. He's always supported me when I did my stint in the military. 
- Okay, great. Hi, young lady. 
- Hello. 
- How are you? 
- Good. 
- Who are you? 
- I'm Cassie. I'm Justin's little sister. He's my big brother, you know, he's always been my hero, and now he's a hero to everybody else. [cheers and applause] 
- So, your friend and your brother has just been offered $33,000. 
- Yeah. 
- You can either take the deal, or you can counter-offer. I want you to talk to your friends. I'm gonna ask you, Justin Uhart, deal or no deal? Talk to them. 
- We both got the Vegas-side opinion here: you just keep going. 
- Yes. 
- Just keep going? 
- We're going all the way, baby. 
- Just rally it up? 
- You got plenty of numbers, keep going. 
- Let it ride? 
- Let it ride. 
- No deal. 
- No deal. Four cases to open. 
- Whoo-whoo. [cheers and applause] 
- So, everybody here considers you a hero. I've never got to ask you, do you have any heroes? 
- Yeah, absolutely. My childhood hero was, uh, Emmitt Smith. I'm a big Dallas Cowboy fan. So...he's a standup guy, and he's an amazing athlete, hall of famer. And he--I would love to meet him someday, but yeah, he's someone I've always looked up to. 
- All right. It's neat to hear a hero who has a hero. Four cases. 
- All right, four cases, Justin, here you go. 
- Whoo. 
- 15, that's Maddi. I think you NFL in your family. 
- I do, unfortunately not the Cowboys, but...

- No deal. 
- No deal. [cheers and applause]

- Thank you. 
- I'm so stoked you're here. 
- Thank you. Now let me just say this to you. Oftentimes-
- oftentimes as athletes, we get chosen as heroes of other people. But the reality of the fact is, we are out there entertaining people and inspiring people to their level of greatness. But when you save a person's life under circumstances that you were under... Nobody else could ever question to me what a hero truly is. 
- Thanks, man. 
- The men and women who save lives and protect our country the way you do, y'all are true heroes, bro, true, true heroes. 
- Thanks a lot, man. 
- And for being who you are, I wanna invite you and a guest to come join me and my wife at the Emmitt Smith Invitational out of Dallas for a weekend of fun with all the celebrities that's gonna be at the golf tournament and to join ourselves at the gala. So... 
- Absolutely. Yes, yes, I'll go.

- Welcome back to Deal Or no Deal. I'm Howie Mandel, this is Justin Uhart, a hero from Vegas. His hero is here... Emmitt Smith. That's so amazing. What a surprise that was. You have one more case to open before the next offer. Are you nervous? 
- Uh, feelin' it, I'm super nervous. 
- Because that $1 million is kinda standing alone. 
- It's there, it's huge. 
- You picked number five before the break. I hope you got something in there, like, a penny or a dollar. Something--anything from the left side. 
- Lani... Open that case. <i> [Music] [Music]</i> 
- Oh, no. 
- Oh, no. 
- Okay, the million's still in. The million is still in. You have a 25% chance of walking out of here with 300,000 or a million dollars. Right? Think of those odds. [phone ringing] [audience booing] Hello. 
- Well, ought to be in six figures right now on the offer. 
- Okay. 
- She's mean. 
- The offer gotta be 150. 
- Obviously, you knocked out a big amount of money. The offer went down. 
- Hmm. 
- Tough game. Emmitt, you know what pressure is like in the middle of a game. 
- Yes, I do. 
- Do you have a philosophy about pressure when you're playing a game? 
- Yep, tune all the noise out. Zone in on your numbers and go for it. 
- Yeah. 
- Whoo. 
- That's right, baby. 
- All right. 
- Okay. 
- Those are words from your hero. The new offer is $60,000. [audience booing] You have not counter-offered yet. You have a counteroffer. 
- Look at--he still has 50 and he still has 75, so the offer is still on the board. 
- That penny is making me real, real nervous, but I'm also saying no deal, 'cause we got Emmitt Smith on our side. 
- Whoo. 
- [laughs] 
- That's a lot of pressure on you. 
- That's right. That's right. 
- All right. 
- Justin Uhart, deal or no deal? [audience exclaiming] 
- [screams] 
- No deal. No deal. [cheers and applause] 
- You go with your gut. You seem to be a guy that goes with the gut. During that Vegas tragedy, you went with your gut. Most people probably would have just run. And you gut was I'm gonna stay there, and I'm gonna save a life. 
- You had to. I mean, the emotion of having a great concert and your friends, and then all of a sudden it just--all hell breaks loose, really messes with you. And when I was running, I saw her on the ground, like, she needed help. There's no way I could have ran away. 
- Uh...uh, I wanna just-
- 
- Oh, my God. Jan. 
- Oh. [cheers and applause] It's Jan. 
- This is the woman whose life he saved. 
- Sorry I didn't get to tell you I was coming. 
- This is the woman that was lying on the ground bleeding. He stopped and he saved her life. [cheers and applause] 
- Whoo. 
- Is it okay if I hold? 
- I'm just blown away right now. 
- This is one of the bravest, kind-hearted young men you'll ever meet. And being able to be here for him today just means the world. This is my hero. 
- Yeah. 
- My hero. Right here. [applause] [sighs] You got this. 
- All right. 
- Let me just help her into a seat. I'm gonna put her right up front here. 
- Okay. 
- Okay. 
- Thank you. [cheers and applause] 
- Go get 'em. 
- Thanks. 
- Thank you so much for coming. How does that make you feel? 
- Man, you are throwing me through a whirlwind of emotions right now. You bring Emmitt Smith, you got my best friends, you got a million dollars still in play with beautiful girls. Now what am I supposed to do? 
- It's all you, don't say me You. 
- This is all you. 
- It's going all around. Two cases. 
- Right. 
- [exhales deeply] 
- That's Kizzi. Kizzi, what a night, huh? 
- Oh, my gosh, I'm so nervous. Justin, you, obviously, changed someone's life. I hope tonight we can change yours. 
- Wow. 
- Keep it low for me, please. 
- Open the case. [indistinct chatter] <i> [Music] [Music]</i> [audience groans] 
- ans] Aw, that hurt. 
- Okay, but let me tell you something. You said that you talked to your friends and your sister out getting it to six figures. 
- Yes. 
- $100,000 and you would be out of here? 
- Yeah. 
- This is three times that, is still in play. [cheers and applause] So, as disappointing as that is, tell me what it would mean if you walked out with sixes. 
- That's a home. $100,000 is a great amount of money to anybody. 
- Okay, one more case to open in this round before the next offer. 
- Two, please. 
- That's Taylor. [applause] To me, this case... Be with your heroes, be with your family, everybody's in the room, I feel the vibes. This has gotta be good. Taylor, anything but the $300,000. Open that case. 
- Come on, come on. 
- Penny, penny, penny, $1. Any of those numbers on the left. <i> [Music] [Music]</i> 
- Okay. 
- Okay. 
- Okay. 
- Okay. 
- All right. 
- Ok 
- Playing with some fire right now. 
- You are playing with fire. 
- Mmm. 
- Lot of it. [phone ringing] 
- Nervou 
- Yeah, ve, and she's laughing up there. [phone ringing] 
- I don't think she's laughing. She's just a businessperson. 
- Hello. <i> [Music] [Music]</i> Okay, all right. <i> [Music] [Music]</i> She said the she is starting to get the feeling that your case is holding the one penny. 
- Wow. 
- There's as much of a chance of it holing the penny as it can possibly be holding There's a lot at stake. 
- A lot at stake. [applause] 
- The offer dropped. 
- It did? 
- Yes. The good news is if you don't take the offer and you wanna play on or you counter and she rejects it and you play on, you're only opening one case at a time. You'll have a five out of six chance of opening anything but the $300,000. So, think about that as I tell you the new offer is $39,000. $39,000, Justin Uhart... Deal or no deal? 
- [clears throat] 
- How do you feel? 
- Oscar, man, like, what do I do here? 
- It is a lot of money. We still have a counteroffer in the back of our pocket, though. 
- That's what I'm playing with too. Do we counter? 
- There's not a losing situation here right now. Think about where you are. Think about the people that you have here right now. You can't lose tonight. [applause] 
- Okay, Jan, I gotta ask you too. Do I keep going? 
- Yes. 
- Keep it going? 
- Yes. 
- Howie... 
- No. 
- I'm already a winner, so I'm gonna keep going. No deal. 
- No deal. 
- No deal. 
- No deal. [cheers and applause] 300,000 still in play when we come back. <i> [exciting music]</i> <i> [Music] [Music]</i> <i> announcer:</i> <i> Justin's on a mission to</i> <i> take home six figures.</i>

- I know. Ignore your hero. [laughter] Where is the penny? Where is that penny? 
- It's 21.

- That's Malika. I am so scared. 
- You're scared? I'm scared.

- Wow, welcome back. This is Justin Uhart. I just wanna say you're a hero; your hero is here, Emmitt Smith; and the person that you are a hero to is right here, the lady you saved. 
- Hey. [cheers and applause] 
- We're at a pivotal part of the game. There is maybe $300,000 at stake. The highest offer so far, before this, was $76,000. 
- So, is it gonna be 76.5? 
- Come on, higher, Emmitt. 
- Howie, you're killing us here. 
- How am I killing you? 
- 'Cause I need you to tell me. 
- [laughs] 
- Hush up. 
- The offer... 
- Yes? 
- Yes? 
- Is $82,000. [cheers and applause] 
- So, I think we're still in the same position as the last offer. I mean, it's a great offer, don't get me wrong. I'd say no deal. 
- Mmm. 
- One case to open. 
- We have that counter. 
- Mm-hmm. 
- Yeah, we do. 
- Counter. 
- So... 
- Get your six figures. 
- If we decide to counter... 
- Uh-huh. 
- How high am I gonna push it? 
- [sighs] 
- 100, why not? 
- I think six. 
- If you decide to counter, and she rejects the counter, you still have to open up on case. 
- What if you counter it to your 100, if she says no then you're just gonna pick another case, and then you'll be up anyways. 
- So, I'm gonna ask you, Justin Uhart... Deal or no deal? 
- I would like to do a counteroffer. 
- There you go. 
- Counteroffer. 
- There you go. 
- There you go. 
- There you go. 
- Be realistic. You said--you know, it's interesting to hear the mentality of people. 'Cause you said, I'd be happy, I would walk out of here with $100,000, as soon as you got the six figures. But then you said, Eh...five. Five more. [phone ringing] 
- Oh. 
- What? [audience groaning] 
- Hello. 
- That was a little high. 
- She's saying that's a pretty big ask on your part. 
- Yeah. 
- I could smile. [laughter] 
- She's saying that's not helping. 
- [laughs] 
- Only about numbers, pure numbers, pure business... 
- Yes. 
- No emotion. 
- Oh, gosh. 
- I'm not a numbers guy... But she is. 
- Hmm. 
- She said based on your gameplay... Based on your risk... But mostly, based on the odds... She said... No deal. [audience groaning] 
- Ooh. 
- All good. 
- Okay. 
- All right. 
- Okay. 
- All right, here we go. 
- Here we go.

- [groans] 
- Oh, come on. 
- She's looking at this board. You got a one out of three chance of having $300,000. 
- Good odds. [cheers and applause] 
- Can you take the heat? 
- I can take the heat, Howie. 
- You think you can take the heat. You're ready to take the heat? 
- He's calling you out. 
- Or are you willing to take 
- Yes! Yes! [cheers and applause] 
- There you go, baby. There you go. You got it. 
- Remember: There could be--you see how much it went up, from $82,000 to $120,000. Went up $40,000. Do you go one more time? There could be $300,000 in this fortune cookie. 
- Take the deal. 
- Justin Uhart, deal or no deal? 
- Deal! [audience exclaiming] 
- Deal! [cheers and applause] 
- You deserve that. 
- Whoo! Thanks, man. 
- Justin, you did it! 
- I did it. 
- Oh, my God. You did it! 
- Whoo! 
- Oh, my God. <i> [Music] [Music]</i> 
- We did it. 
- You did it. 
- Okay, come here. 
- Whoo. 
- Okay, Justin. Well played. You're leaving here with $120,000. [cheers and applause] No question about it. But let's find out if you made a good deal. 
- All right. 
- Yes. 
- You sold this for $120,000. This case was worth... You made a good deal. Open those cases. 
- Oh, man. 
- There's the $1. That's okay. 
- You're good. 
- You did good, buddy. You played it right. I wouldn't have gone on. That's it! Thanks to Jan Lambourne, Emmitt Smith. He's gonna be taking Justin to a celebrity invitational golf tournament. Justin Uhart picked the case based on a fortune cookie, and he's walking out of here with $120,000.
