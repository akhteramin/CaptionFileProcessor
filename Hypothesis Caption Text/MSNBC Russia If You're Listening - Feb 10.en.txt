 FORMS INCLUDING TAX BREAK. WE'LL SEE OTHER CANDIDATES GIVE
 THEIR IDEA WHETHER THEY SUPPORT
 IT OR NOT.
 FURTHER ON THE DECLARATION OF
 EMERGENCIES.
 A LOT OF CONSERVATIVE SENATORS
 ARE GOING TO VOTE AGAINST IT.
 THEY LIKE THE FUNDING OF THE
 WALL BUT THEY DON'T LIKE THE
 ABUSE OF PRESIDENTIAL POWER.
 I WOULD SAY THE PRESIDENT'S
 BUDGET AS WE ARE SPEAKING, NANCY
 PELOSI, PUT OUT A RELEASE, BRING
 OUT THE WALL, WE'LL NOT GIVE IT
 TO YOU.

 I, TOO, WILL BE COVERING THE
 DECLARATION.
 THAT'LL BE IT FOR US TONIGHT,
 COMING UP NEXT, "RUSSIA IF YOU
 ARE LISTENING," AN MSNBC'S
 SPECIAL FROM ALI VELSHI.
 THIS IS AN MSNBC SPECIAL
 PRESENTATION.
 ALL WE HEAR ABOUT IS THIS
 PHONY RUSSIA WITCH HUNT.
 THE MUELLER/RUSSIA REPORT IS
 NOT READY YET.
 WASHINGTON IS IN EAGER AND
 ANTICIPATION MODE.
 OUR REPORT IS.
 THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT.
 THE UNPRECEDENTED MOMENTS.
 THOSE WERE LIES AND I AM SO
 SORRY THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
 WERE TOLD THAT.
 MR. TRUMP KNEW OF AND
 DIRECTED THE TRUMP MOSCOW
 NEGOTIATIONS THROUGHOUT THE
 CAMPAIGN AND LIED ABOUT IT.
 THE INFAMOUS MEETING.
 WHEN YOU TELL SOMEONE YOU
 HAVE DIRT, ONCE YOU GET A YES,
 YOU HAVE HOOKED YOUR FISH.
 BECAUSE THEY LIED THAT MAKES IT
 LOOK MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN IT
 IS.
 THE AGGRESSIVE DEFENSE.
 FAKE NEWS OF THE RUSSIA WITCH
 HUNT.
 TRUMP CREATE A GREAT JOB
 CREATING AN ATMOSPHERE THAT A
 THIRD OF THE COUNTRY WILL NOT
 BELIEVE ANYTHING THAT ROBERT
 MUELLER SAYS.
 HOW DO WE GET HERE?
 I AM CONCERNED THAT DONALD
 TRUMP IS BEHAVING SOMEONE WHO
 MAY HAVE BEEN COMPROMISED OR
 BLACKMAILED BY RUSSIA.
 THE HOUSE COMMITTEE SENDING
 OUTLETERS TO INDIVIDUALS LOOKING
 FOR THESE THINGS.
 IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE THE
 WORSE THING THAT HAPPENS TO
 DONALD TRUMP WAS BEING ELECTED
 PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
 RUSSIA, IF YOU ARE LISTENING,
 I HOPE YOU ARE ABLE TO FIND THE
 30,000 E-MAILS THAT ARE MISSING.
 FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS, THE
 NATION HAS BEEN CONSUMED BY
 QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER TRUMP
 CAMPAIGN AND THE RUSSIANS
 INTERFERED IN THE 2016
 ELECTIONS?
 WE HAVE A SPECIAL COUNSEL TO
 HEAD THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION.
 THE FBI RAIDED THE OFFICE OF
 THE LAWYER OF THE PRESIDENT OF
 THE UNITED STATES.
 THERE IS STILL NO EVIDENCE OF
 COLLUSION BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT
 AND ANYONE.
 WAS THERE COLLUSION,
 OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE, IMPROPER
 CONTACT BETWEEN RUSSIAN
 OFFICIALS AND THE CAMPAIGN?
 IT IS THE FOCUS OF THE MUELLER
 INVESTIGATION AND WHAT WE'LL
 DIVE INTO TONIGHT.
 BEGINNING WITH THE QUESTION, HOW
 DID WE GET HERE?
 WE NEED MORE LOVE AND
 KINDNESS IN THIS COUNTRY.
 JUST DAYS BEFORE DEMOCRATS WOULD
 NAME HILLARY CLINTON THEIR
 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE, WIKILEAKS
 UPLOADED NEARLY 20,000 HACKED
 E-MAILS.
 U.S. INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES
 BELIEVE RUSSIAN CYBER SPIES
 HACKED INTO THE COMPUTER
 BELONGING TO THE DEMOCRATIC
 NATIONAL COMMITTEE.
 THEY REALIZED WHAT THEY HAD
 BEEN LOOKING AT IS A CREDIBLY
 COMPLEX TACT DIRECTED BY THE
 KREMLIN DESIGNED UNDERMINE OUR
 DEMOCRACY, DEFEAT HILLARY
 CLINTON AND ELECT DONALD TRUMP.
 WHICH AS ESPECIALLY IN
 HINDSIGHT MADE THAT NOW FAMOUS
 PRESS CONFERENCE EVEN MORE
 UNFORGETTABLE.
 RUSSIA, IF YOU ARE LISTENING,
 I HOPE YOU ARE ABLE TO FIND THE
 30,000 E-MAILS THAT ARE MISSING.
 APPARENTLY, RUSSIA WAS
 LISTENING.
 THE RUSSIANS TOOK IT.
 WITHIN HOURS THEY STARTED TRYING
 TO HACK HER SERVER.
 FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN ADVISER,
 SAM NUNBERG.
 IT IS NOT A COINCIDENCE.
 RUSSIA TOOK IT LITERALLY.
 DAYS AFTER TRUMP'S UNUSUAL
 REQUEST, THE FBI OPENED A
 COUNTER INTELLIGENCE INTO
 RUSSIA'S ATTEMPT TO INFLUENCE
 THE ELECTION AND ANY POSSIBLE
 CONNECTION WITH THE TRUMP
 CAMPAIGN.
 THEY SAID YOU ADMIRE
 PRESIDENT PUTIN?
 I SAID I DON'T ADMIRE HIM, I
 SAID HE'S A STRONG LEADER, MAY
 BE BAD OR GOOD.
 TRUMP'S REGARD FOR VLADIMIR
 PUTIN ALSO PEAKED THE INTEREST
 OF THE FBI AS DID THE MANY
 RUSSIA CONNECTIONS AMONG HIS
 CAMPAIGN STAFFS.
 YOU HAVE CARTER PAGE AND
 GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS AND FELIX
 SATER, ALL OF THESE CHARACTERS
 WERE HAVING CONTACTS WITH
 RUSSIAN OFFICIALS IN ONE WAY OR
 ANOTHER.
 MICHAEL FLYNN, THE ADVISER
 WITH A RUSSIAN CONNECTION,
 MICHAEL FLYNN.
 WE DO NOT NEED A RECKLESS
 PRESIDENT WHO BELIEVES SHE IS
 ABOVE THE LAW.
 IN 2015, FLYNN HAD TRAVELED
 TO MOSCOW WHERE HE WAS PAID TO
 APPEAR ON R.T., RUSSIA TODAY.
 I KNOW HE SAID THAT AND I
 DISAGREE WITH THAT.
 I DEFINITELY DISAGREE WITH THAT.
 HE STOOD AND APPLAUDED
 PUTIN'S SPEECH WHEN EMERGED
 LATER THAT HE WAS PAID, HIS
 COMPANY WAS PAID SOME $45,000.
 AFTER TRUMP'S VICTORY IN
 NOVEMBER, HE NAMED FLYNN
 NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER
 AGAINST THE ADVICE OF OUT GOING
 PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA WHO
 REPORTEDLY WARNED TRUMP THAT
 FLYNN LACKED THE TEMPERAMENT FOR
 THE JOB.
 I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE
 THE CONVERSATION WITH
 PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP, PRESIDENT
 OBAMA STRUCK BACK AT RUSSIA FOR
 THE CYBER ATTACK EJECTING 35
 SUSPECTED RUSSIAN SPIES FROM THE
 U.S. AND IMPOING SANCTIONS
 AGAINST RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE
 SERVICES.
 VLADIMIR PUTIN RESPONDED
 SURPRISINGLY BY NOT RESPONDING.
 HE ANNOUNCED HE WOULD NOT
 RETALIATE AGAINST THE U.S. FOR
 POSING NEW SANCTIONS TO
 INTERFERE WITH THE ELECTION.
 WHAT THE PUBLIC DID NOT KNOW
 WAS ON THE DAY PRESIDENT OBAMA
 ANNOUNCED THOSE SANCTIONS,
 MICHAEL FLYNN, HAD CONVERSATIONS
 WITH SERGEI KISLYAK.
 ONE OF THE THINGS HE SAID WAS
 BASICALLY DON'T REACT TO THIS.
 HOLD TIGHT, THERE IS A NEW
 ADMINISTRATION COMING IN AND IT
 WON'T BE A PROBLEM.
 GENERAL FLYNN SHOULD HAVE
 KNOWN THE FBI MONITORS ALL CALLS
 WITH FOREIGN DIPLOMATS TO U.S.
 CITIZENS.
 THE DUTIES OF THE OFFICE ON
 WHICH I AM ABOUT TO ENTER.
 SOON AFTER FLYNN WAS SWORN IN
 AS NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER,
 SHE WAS QUESTIONED BY THE FBI.
 HE WAS ASKED ABOUT HIS
 CONTACTS WITH THE RUSSIANS
 DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL
 TRANSITION.
 HE DENIED THAT HE DISCUSSED
 THE SANCTIONS WHEN REALLY THEY
 HAD EVIDENCE THAT HE HAD IN FACT
 BROUGHT IT UP.
 U.S. INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS
 BELIEVE FLYNN MADE THE SAME
 DENIAL TO VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT
 PENCE.
 OVER AT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT,
 TOP OFFICIALS KNEW FLYNN HAD
 BEEN UNTRUTH.
 DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL
 SALLY YATES SHARED HER CONCERNS.
 SHE THOUGHT FLYNN WAS
 BLACKMAILED BECAUSE HE DID NOT
 TELL THE TRUTH.
 I HAD TO STATE THE OBVIOUS,
 YOU DON'T WANT YOUR NATIONAL
 SECURITY ADVISER COMPROMISE WITH
 THE RUSSIANS.
 THE PRESIDENT IGNORED THE
 WARNINGS AND THE NEXT 18 DAYS
 DID NOTHING TO CORRECT THE
 PUBLIC DECEPTION.
 HE'S TRYING TO HOLD ONTO
 MICHAEL FLYNN DESPITE THE FACT
 THAT HE'S COMPROMISED.
 FOR PROSECUTORS, IT RAISES ONE
 QUESTION, WHY?
 THE WASHINGTON POST JUST
 POSTED THIS NATIONAL SECURITY
 ADVISER, MICHAEL FLYNN,

 DISCUSSED SANCTIONS BEFORE TRUMP
 TOOK OFFICE DESPITE DENIALS,
 OFFICIALS SAY.
 NOT UNTIL THE WASHINGTON POST
 REVEALED FLYNN HAD DISCUSSED
 SANCTIONS WITH RUSSIA.
 NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER,
 MICHAEL FLYNN HAS RESIGNED.
 A DAY AFTER HE RESIGNED, THE
 PRESIDENT MET WITH THE MAN
 OVERSEEING THE FBI
 INVESTIGATION, DIRECTOR JAMES
 COMEY.
 COMEY IS AT THE WHITE HOUSE
 FOR A MEETING AND TRUMP KICKS
 EVERYONE OUT IN THE ROOM AND HE
 WANTS TO TALK ABOUT THE FLYNN
 INVESTIGATION.
 LOOK, FLYNN DID NOT DO ANYTHING
 WRONG, I NEED YOU TO MOVE PASS
 AND NOT DO THIS INVESTIGATION.
 COMEY WAS ASKED ABOUT THE
 CONVERSATION AT A CONGRESSIONAL
 HEARING.
 HE'S A GOOD GUY.
 I HOPE YOU CAN LET THIS GO.
 NOW, THOSE ARE HIS EXACT WORDS,
 CORRECT?
 YES.
 HE DID NOT ORDER YOU TO LET
 IT GO.
 I TOOK IT AS A DIRECTION.
 IT IS A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
 STATES WITH ME ALONE SAYING I
 HOPE THIS, I TOOK IT AS THIS IS
 WHAT HE WANTS ME TO DO.
 I DID NOT OBEY THAT BUT THAT'S
 WHAT I TOOK IT.
 THE PRESIDENT DENIED ASKING
 COMEY TO STOP INVESTIGATING
 FLYNN.
 A LITTLE MONTH LATER, HE TOOK
 THE SHOCKING STEP OF DISMISSING
 THE FBI DIRECTOR.
 COMEY IS OUT IN LOS ANGELES,
 TALKING TO SOME STAFF THERE AND
 HE LOOKS UP AND SEES ON THE
 TELEVISION IN THE BACK OF THE
 ROOM, THE CRAWL, THE BREAKING
 NEWS ALERT THAT HE'S BEEN FIRED.
 HE SAYS -THAT'S FUNNY, HIS
 AIDES COME UP TO HIM AND SAY,
 ACTUALLY SIR, THIS IS NOT A
 JOKE.
 TRUMP APPEARED CRYSTAL CLEAR
 ABOUT IT THE NEXT DAY.
 THE PRESIDENT WAS IN THE OVAL
 OFFICE WITH THE RUSSIAN
 AMBASSADOR, SERGEI KISLYAK AND
 LAVROV AND ACCORDING TO PRESS
 ACCOUNTS OF THAT MEETING, HE
 DESCRIBED JAMES COMEY AS A "NUT
 JOB" AND BOASTED THAT HE HAD
 RELIEVED A LOT OF PRESSURE ON
 HIMSELF BY GETTING RID OF HIM.
 TRUMP ECHOED A SIMILAR SENTENCE
 INTO NBC NEWS ANCHOR, LESTER
 HOLT.
 MONDAY YOU MET WITH ROD
 ROSENSTEIN, DID YOU ASK HIM FOR
 A RECOMMENDATION?
 REGARDLESS OF RECOMMENDATION,
 I WAS GOING TO FIRE COMEY
 KNOWING THERE IS NO GOOD TIME TO
 DO IT.

 IN FACT, WHEN I DECIDED TO DO
 IT, I SAID TO MYSELF, YOU
 KNOW -THIS RUSSIA THING WITH
 TRUMP AND RUSSIA IS A MADE-UP
 STORY, IT IS AN EXCUSE BY THE
 DEMOCRATS FOR HAVING LOST IN THE
 ELECTION.
 A WEEK LATER, DEPUTY ATTORNEY
 GENERAL, ROD ROSENSTEIN,
 ANNOUNCED HE WAS APPOINTING A
 SPECIAL COUNSEL TO OVERSEE THE
 RUSSIA INVESTIGATION.
 IT WAS A TURNING POINT IN THE
 TRUMP PRESIDENCY THAT DONALD
 TRUMP BLAMED ON ATTORNEY GENERAL
 JEFF SESSIONS.
 A TOP ADVISER DURING THIS
 CAMPAIGN.
 I HAD INVOLVEMENT WITH THE
 CAMPAIGN, I SHOULD NOT BE
 INVOLVED IN ANY CAMPAIGN
 INVESTIGATIONS.
 THEREFORE, I HAVE RECUSED MYSELF
 IN THE MATTERS THAT DEAL WITH
 THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.
 HIS RECUSAL GAVE ROD
 ROSENSTEIN THE POWER TO APPOINT
 A SPECIAL COUNSEL, HIS CHOICE,
 ROBERT SWAN MUELLER III.
 COMING UP, I AM VERY
 CONCERNED THAT DONALD TRUMP IS
 BEHAVING LIKE SOMEONE WHO MAY
 HAVE BEEN COMPROMISED OR
 BLACKMAILED BY RUSSIA.
                       I'm 3,000,
   I'm connected with my boys.
        Just pull on over,        see my son's game,
      and I'm having a ball.
      There when it matters.
      Buy the new Galaxy S10   and get a Galaxy S10e on us.
       <i> You wouldn't accept</i>       <i> an incomplete job</i>

   <i> Flonase Sensimist relieves</i>   <i> all your worst symptoms,</i>

   IT LETS YOU KILL WHAT'S BAD   RIGHT DOWN TO THE ROOT

        So why am I still       thinking about this?
         I'll take Aleve.
            <i> ALEVE.</i>    <i> Proven better on pain.</i>
 DONALD TRUMP RAN FOR PRESIDENT CLAIMING HE MASTERED
 THE ART OF THE DEAL.
 IN 2016, DID VLADIMIR PUTIN
 MAKE HIM AN OFFER HE COULD NOT
 REFUSE?
 LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP, VLADIMIR
 PUTIN, HAS SUPREME POLITICAL
 POWER AND INCREDIBLE PERSONAL
 WEALTH.
 IN 2012, U.S. SANCTIONS, MADE
 PUTIN A FORTUNE INTO ACHILLES'
 HEELS.
 VLADIMIR PUTIN DOES NOT KEEP
 MONEY IN HIS OWN NAME.
 HE KEEPS MONEY IN THE NAMES OF
 MANY RUSSIAN OLIGARCHS.
 THIS WILL FREEZE THE ASSETS.
 I BELIEVE THAT PUTIN IS THE
 RICHEST MAN IN THE WORLD.
 I BELIEVE HE'S WORTH
 $200 BILLION.
 THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION PUTS
 THAT MONEY AT RISK.
 DONALD TRUMP RUNS FOR PRESIDENT
 MAY GIVEN VLADIMIR PUTIN A
 CHANCE TO GET THOSE SANCTIONS
 LIFTED.
 INVESTIGATORS LIKELY INTERESTED
 WHETHER PUTIN, A KGB
 RECRUITER, --
 IT WOULD CAUSE AN
 EMBARRASSMENT OR THREATEN.
 IT IS WHAT YOU USE TO HANG OVER
 SOMEBODY'S HEAD AS A MEAN TO
 CONTROL.
 A DEPUTY OF ASSISTANT OF
 STATE FOCUSED ON INTERNATIONAL
 ORGANIZED CRIMES IN THE 1990s.
 IT IS ALMOST, ALWAYS OR TWO
 KINDS OF THINGS, IT IS EITHER
 FINANCIAL COMPROMISE, YOU TAKEN
 A PAYMENT FROM SOMEONE YOU DO
 NOT REPORT OR YOU HAVE DONE
 SEXUALLY THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE IT
 DISCLOSE.
 THE RUSSIANS LOOK FOR A CORRUPT
 BUSINESSMAN AND A TARGET
 COUNTRY.
 THEY SEEK COMPROMISE THAT
 CORRUPT BUSINESS PERSON.
 AND INJECT THAT CORRUPT BUSINESS
 PERSON LIKE A VIRUS INTO THE
 POLITICAL BUSINESS STRUCTURE OF
 A COUNTRY.
 THANK YOU.
 WHETHER DONALD TRUMP HAD BEEN
 COMPROMISED BY RUSSIAN
 INTELLIGENCE IS A CORE MYSTERY
 OF THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION.
 THE PRESIDENT HAS REPEATEDLY
 DENIED HE HAS BUSINESS TIES TO
 RUSSIA.
 BUT FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS IN
 THE MID 2000S AND COMMENTS BY
 HIS OWN FAMILY SUGGESTS OTHER
 WISE.
 STARTING AROUND 2006, THE
 TRUMP AND THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION
 GOING ON SHOPPING SPREES AND
 SPENDING A LOT OF CASH AND A
 NUMBER OF ACQUISITION INCLUDING
 MAJOR GOLF COURSE IN SCOTLAND.
 THERE IS A QUESTION AROUND WHERE
 DID THEY GET THE MONEY TO DO
 THIS.
 IN 2008, DONALD TRUMP JR. STATED
 THAT RUSSIA WAS AN IMPORTANT
 FINANCIAL PARTNER.
 DONALD TRUMP JR. SAYS IN THE
 2008 CONFERENCE QUOTE, "RUSSIANS
 MAKE UP A PRETTY
 DISPROPORTIONATE CROSS-SECTION
 OF A LOT OF OUR ASSETS."
 WE SEE A LOT OF MONEY POURING IN
 FROM RUSSIA.
 ERIC TRUMP TOLD JAMES DODSON
 THE SAME THING.
 ERIC TRUMP SUGGESTED TO A
 WELL REGARDED CALL THAT THOSE
 FUNDING CAME FROM RUSSIA.
 ERIC TRUMP TOLD THE NEW YORK
 POST THAT HE WAS MISQUOTED,
 STATING THE ALLEGATIONS WAS
 QUOTE, "COMPLETE GARBAGE."
 DONALD TRUMP HAD BEEN TO RUSSIA
 MORE THAN ONCE.
 HE FIRST WENT TO 1987 WHEN IT IS
 STILL THE SOVIET UNION, HE
 RETURNED IN 1996.
 HIS CONNECTION WITH RUSSIA GREW
 DEEPLY WHEN A RUSSIAN OLIGARCH
 HELPED HIM STAGE THE PAGEANT IN
 RUSSIA.
 WE MET AGUILAR IN MOSCOW AND
 HE CAME UP TO US AND RECEIVED A
 WARM WELCOME.
 ROB GOLD STONE IS A PUBLICIST
 WHO WORKS FOR AGUILAR.
 MR. TRUMP SAYS HE BELIEVES
 THAT THE RUSSIANS HAD A STRONG
 LEADER IN PRESIDENT PUTIN UNLIKE
 AMERICA WHOSE LEADER WAS WEAK.
 DONALD TRUMP EXPRESSED HOPE
 ON TWITTER THAT HE AND PUTIN
 WOULD BECOME BEST FRIENDS.
 IN NOVEMBER OF 2013, SOON AFTER
 THE PAGEANT ENDED, DONALD TRUMP
 ANNOUNCED HIS DREAMS OF BUILDING
 A TOWER IN MOSCOW BEARING HIS
 NAME.
 HE ENTRUSTED THE DEAL TO HIS
 RIGHT HAND MAN AND PERSONAL
 FIXER, MICHAEL COHEN.
 AT SOME POINT IN 2015, THE
 TRUMP ORGANIZATION BEGAN TO TRY
 TO TAKE ACTION AROUND BUILDING A
 MAJOR SKYSCRAPER IN MOSCOW.
 MICHAEL COHEN WAS A KEY FORCE IN
 PLANNING THAT THOUGHT IN THE
 PRESIDENT'S EARS.
 TRUMP HAD A FINANCIAL INTEREST
 IN TRYING TO GET SOMETHING DONE
 IN RUSSIA AT THE VERY MOMENT
 WHEN TRUMP HIMSELF WAS A
 CANDIDATE FOR THE MOST POWERFUL
 OFFICE IN THE WORLD.
 BUT EVEN AS CANDIDATE TRUMP
 DENIED BUSINESS TIES TO RUSSIA,
 CONFIDENTIAL REPORTS CLAIMING
 OTHERWISE SURFACED IN
 WASHINGTON, D.C.
 WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE STEELE
 DOSSIER IS NAMED FOR THE BRITISH
 INTELLIGENCE TO COMPILE ITS
 CONTENT.
 THE STEELE DOSSIER IS
 COLLECTION OF TIPS COMPILED BY
 BRITISH AGENTS WHO WAS HIRED BY
 REPUBLICAN CAMPAIGNS AND BY
 HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN TO FIND
 OUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH DONALD
 TRUMP RUSSIA.
 STEEL BEGAN HIS INVESTIGATION
 IN THE FALL OF 2015 AND
 CONTINUED INTO 2016.
 IN JUNE, STEEL'S FIRST REPORT
 SUGGESTED THAT RUSSIA HAD
 COMPROMISED AND THEN CANDIDATE
 TRUMP INCLUDING ALLEGEDLY
 COMPROMISING FINANCIAL AND
 SEXUAL INFORMATION.
 I MET WITH STEEL AND HE KNEW
 MORE ABOUT RUSSIA ORGANIZE
 CRIMES THAN I DID.
 I KNEW A LOT BUT HE KNEW MORE.
 THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT HAD A
 RELATIONSHIP WITH DONALD TRUMP
 OF ONGOING CONTACTS BETWEEN
 DONALD TRUMP AND THOSE CLOSE IN
 THE RUSSIA GOVERNMENT.
 STEEL'S REPORT GREW MORE
 ALARMING.
 STEEL HEARING OF THE FACT
 THAT RUSSIA WAS DANGLING DEALS
 WITH TRUMP.
 HE KNEW THE NAMES LIKE MICHAEL
 COHEN AND FELIX SATER.
 IT WAS TOTALLY OUTSIDE THE
 EXPERIENCES OF ANYTHING THAT
 ANYONE HAD EVER HEARD ABOUT A
 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE.
 SOME OF THE DOSSIERS HAVE BEEN
 CORROBORATED BUT MUCH OF IT HAS
 NOT INCLUDING ITS SEXUAL
 ALLEGATIONS.
 IN THE CLOSING DAYS OF 2016 AS
 PRESIDENT OBAMA STRUGGLED TO
 RESPOND TO A PRESIDENT ASSAULT,
 THE STEELE DOSSIER WAS LARGELY

 UNKNOWN TO THE PUBLIC.
 BY THE TIME IT WAS PUBLIC TO
 BUZZ FEED IN 2016, DONALD TRUMP
 HAD ALREADY WON THE ELECTION.
 I AM VERY CONCERNED.
 I AM CONCERNED THAT DONALD
 TRUMP IS BEHAVING LIKE SOMEONE
 WHO MAY HAVE BEEN COMPROMISED OR
 BLACKMAILED BY RUSSIA.
 THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO GET
 TO THE BOTTOM OF.
                   WE NEED TO GE
 TO THE BOTTOM OF
 COMING UP. WE HAVE THE PRESIDENT OF THE
 UNITED STATES LITERALLY
 DEFENDING THE PRESIDENT OF
 RUSSIA.
          I switched to          Liberty Mutual
    because they let me  customize my insurance,
  and as a fitness junkie,  I customize everything.
   Like my bike and my calves.
    <i> Liberty Mutual customizes</i>        <i> your car insurance</i>
       <i> so you only pay for</i>          <i> what you need.</i>
       <i> ♪ Liberty. Liberty.</i>       <i> Liberty. Liberty. ♪</i>
 I THINK I GET ALONG VERY WELL WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN.
 I THINK I GET ALONG WELL WITH
 HIM.
 WHILE THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION
 NEARS THE TWO-YEAR MARK AND NO
 INFORMATION ABOUT ITS FINDINGS
 ARE AVAILABLE.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS WHITE
 HOUSE REPEATEDLY STATED THERE
 WAS NO COLLUSION BETWEEN HIS
 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN AND
 RUSSIA.
 THERE WAS NO COLLUSION.
 NO COLLUSION.
 EVIDENCE OF CONTACT BETWEEN
 RUSSIA AND HIS FAMILY AND
 ASSOCIATES AND DONALD TRUMP

 HIMSELF.
 ONE EVENT STANDS ABOVE THE REST
 AS EVIDENT POTENTIAL COLLUSION
 BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND
 RUSSIAN OPERATES.
 THE MEETING OF JUNE 9th, 2016 AT
 TRUMP TOWER.
 WHO WAS TRUMP'S CLOSEST
 BUSINESS ASSOCIATES IN RUSSIA?
 THE GUY HE DID MISS UNIVERSE
 WITH.
 SO IF YOU WANT TO GET A MESSAGE
 TO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN FROM THE
 RUSSIA'S SIDE, THOSE ARE THE
 PEOPLE WHO YOU GO TO.
 ROB GOLDSTEIN, A PUBLICIST
 ORCHESTRATED THE EVENT AND WOULD
 NOT ATTEND THE MEETING.
 THE MESSAGE TO HIS E-MAIL NO
 DONALD TRUMP JR. WOULD LATER
 RAISE EYE BROWS.
 SOME OFFICIALS DOCUMENTS AND
 INFORMATION THAT'LL IN CRIMINATE
 HILLARY.
 DON JR. WOULD LATER IGNITE A
 FIRE STORM OF CONTROVERSY.
 HE SAYS I LOVE IT.
 IT BECOMES PART OF THE EVIDENCE
 RECORD THAT KNEW AND TRYING TO
 GET DIRT WITH HILLARY CLINTON IN

 KAHOOT WITH RUSSIAN NATIONALS.
 WHEN YOU TELL SOMEONE WE HAVE
 DIRT ON HILLARY AND YOU ARE
 TESTING THE WATERS TO SEE WHAT
 THE RESPONSE IS AND ONCE YOU GET
 A YES, A POSITIVE RESPONSE TO
 THAT.
 YOU HAVE HOOKED YOUR FISH.
 JOINING DON JR. AT THE
 MEETING, DONALD TRUMP'S
 SON-IN-LAW, JARED KUSHNER AND
 CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN PAUL MANAFORT,
 THE POWERFUL POLITICAL
 CONSULTANT WITH TIES TO RUSSIA.
 IT  INCLUDES NATHIALI BUTINA.
 THE QUESTION HAD ALWAYS BEEN
 DID CANDIDATE TRUMP KNEW ABOUT
 THE MEETING FROM HAPPENING?
 IF TRUMP KNEW AND DID IN THE
 STOP IT FROM HAPPENING, THAT IN
 ITSELF IS A CRIME EVEN IF HE DID
 NOT ASK OR DIRECT IT.
 IF DONALD TRUMP JR. AND JARED
 KUSHNER TOOK THIS MEETING
 INNOCENTLY AND IGNORANTLY IS
 POSSIBLE.
 MR. MANAFORT WOULD KNOW.
 ALTHOUGH THE MEETING REPORTEDLY
 DIDN'T DELIVER ANY IN
 CRIMINATING INFORMATION, IT DID
 CAUSE PROBLEMS FOR DON JR. WHEN
 CONTACTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES,
 RELEASED A SHORT STATEMENT THAT
 THE MEETING WAS PRIMARILY ABOUT
 RUSSIAN ADOPTION.
 WHEN THE "TIMES" FOLLOWED UP, HE
 CHANGED HIS EXPLANATION.
 DONALD TRUMP RELEASING
 E-MAILS THAT CONFIRMED HE MET
 LAST YEAR WITH SOMEONE DESCRIBED
 AS A RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT
 ATTORNEY.
 IT WAS LATER REPORTED THAT THE
 PRESIDENT DICTATED JOHN JR.'S
 ORIGINAL STATEMENT ABOUT
 ADOPTION.
 DON JR. PUTS THE LIE OUT, HE
 KNEW HE WAS GOING TO A MEETING
 TO GET DIRT FROM HILLARY CLINTON
 FROM A RUSSIAN NATIONAL WHICH I
 CAN'T SAY OFTEN ENOUGH BECAUSE
 THAT'S JUST DAMMING.
 HAD THEY JUST EXPLAIN
 EVERYTHING?
 HAD THOSE E-MAILS BEEN RELEASED
 BY DON JR. FROM THE BEGINNING?
 THERE IS NO THERE THERE.
 IT IS BECAUSE THEY LIED THAT
 MAKES IT LOOKED MORE SIGNIFICANT
 THAN IT IS.
 AS THE CAMPAIGN CONTINUES SO
 DID CONTACTS BETWEEN TRUMP
 ASSOCIATES AND RUSSIAN
 INDIVIDUALS.
 AFTER WINNING THE ELECTION, THE
 PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP PRORUSSIA
 STATEMENTS RAISED CONCERNS.
 IF PUTIN LIKES DONALD TRUMP,
 GUESS WHAT, FOLKS, THAT'S CALLED
 AN ASSET, NOT A LIABILITY.
 IN 2018, WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP
 CRITICIZED AMERICAN ALLIES IN
 THE EUROPEAN UNION AND BARBED
 THE U.S.'S ROLE IN NATO.
 WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DO
 SOMETHING BECAUSE WE ARE NOT
 GOING TO PUT UP WITH IT.
 HIS WORDS SENT SHOCK WAVES
 AROUND THE WORLD BECAUSE A WEEK
 IN NATO WHICH WAS CREATED TO
 PROTECT AGAINST RUSSIAN
 AGGRESSION COULD STRENGTHEN
 PUTIN'S INFLUENCE.
 THE UNUSUAL RELATIONSHIP
 CONTINUED TO EVALUATE AND IN
 JULY 2018, DURING THE HELSINKI
 MEETING, THE PRESIDENT WAS PUT
 IN THE SPOT IN THE ENTIRE WORLD.
 EVERY U.S. INTELLIGENCE
 COMPUTED THAT RUSSIA DID
 INTERFERED.
 MY FIRST QUESTION TO YOU, SIR,
 WHO DO YOU BELIEVE?
 PEOPLE CAME TO ME AND THEY
 SAID THEY THINK IT IS RUSSIA.
 I HAVE PRESIDENT PUTIN, HE JUST
 SAID IT IS NOT RUSSIA.
 I WILL SAY THIS, I DON'T SEE ANY
 REASON WHY IT WOULD BE.
 WE HAVE THE PRESIDENT OF THE
 UNITED STATES LITERALLY
 DEFENDING THE PRESIDENT OF
 RUSSIA.
 TELLING THE WORLD THAT HIS OWN
 INTELLIGENCE APPARATUS IS NOT
 RIGHT.
 THAT'S ASTOUNDING.
 DESPITE STATING THAT HE
 MISSPOKE THE NEXT DAY.
 I SAID THE WORD "WOULD,"
 INSTEAD OF "WOULDN' T."
 PEOPLE ARE SPEAKING OUT IN WAYS
 I HAVE NOT HEARD BEFORE, NOT
 ONLY AMERICAN DIPLOMATS BUT
 FOREIGN DIPLOMATS WHO WERE
 SAYING WE CAN'T RELY ON THE
 PRESIDENT.
 TO ME THAT'S SOMETHING HE
 WOULD HAVE TO LOOK INTO.
 THE PRESIDENT HAD GONE TO GREAT
 LENGTHS TO CONCEAL THE DETAILS
 OF THE PRIVATE HELSINKI MEETING
 AS HE HAS FOR EACH OF THE FOUR
 PRIVATE MEETINGS HE HAD WITH
 VLADIMIR PUTIN, LEADING MANY TO
 ASK, IS THIS A BROMANCE OR
 SOMETHING ELSE?
 I DON'T LIKE THE TERM
 BROMANCE BECAUSE THAT IMPLIES
 THERE IS A MUTUAL RELATIONSHIP.
 I THINK DONALD TRUMP IS
 HANDLING A SPY AND TO SIT WITH
 AN EX KGB WHO'S THE LEADER OF
 THE GREATEST MAFIA IN THE WORLD,
 YOU ARE GOING TO GET HANDLED AND
 NOT JUST HANDLED, HE'S GOING TO
 MANIPULATE YOU AND YOU WOULD
 THINK IT IS A BROMANCE, HE WILL
 THINK THAT HE'S NOW IN CONTROL
 OF THE UNITED STATES.
 COMING UP.
 MR. STONE TOLD MR. TRUMP THAT
 HE JUST GOTTEN OFF THE PHONE
 WITH JULIAN ASSANGE.
 WE JUST DON'T KNOW AND IF HE
 KNEW IT FOR CERTAIN, HOW HE KNEW
 IT FOR CERTAIN.
           ...we're open        just pass the ball!
  No, I can't believe how easy it  was to save hundreds of dollars
             on my car       insurance with GEICO.
               Yea.
        [QUARTET SINGING]    Shoot the J! Shoot, shoot,      shoot the jaaaaaay...
  <i> Believe it! GEICO could save</i>      <i> you fifteen percent</i>
    <i> or more on car insurance.</i>
       <i> You wouldn't accept</i>       <i> an incomplete job</i>
       <i> from any one else.</i>
       <i> Why accept it from</i>       <i> your allergy pills?</i>
   <i> Flonase Sensimist relieves</i>   <i> all your worst symptoms,</i>

 HIS WALL.
 NOW BACK TO "RUSSIA, IF YOU ARE
 LISTENING."
 A NUMBER OF PEOPLE AROUND
 THIS CAMPAIGN WITH TIES FROM
 RUSSIA.
 PEOPLE DO NOT SEEM TO BE LYING
 ABOUT SPAIN OR NETHERLANDS OR
 ITALY OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
 IT IS RUSSIA.
 SINCE THE RUSSIA
 INVESTIGATION BEGAN, HIS OFFICE
 OBTAINED CONVICTIONS OF FIVE
 ASSOCIATES OF DONALD TRUMP.
 THE CHARGES HAVE RANGED FROM
 LYING TO THE FBI TO TAX
 EVASIONS.
 THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S FILINGS
 HAVE MADE IT CLEAR THAT ALL FIVE
 HAD SUSPICIOUS CONTACTS WITH
 RUSSIA DURING THE CAMPAIGN.
 THERE IS A LOT OF EFFORTS BY
 THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT TO TAMPER
 IN THE INTERFERENCE.
 A SIXTH INDICTMENT CAME IN
 JANUARY 2019 AGAINST ROGER STONE
 FOR MAKING FALSE STATEMENTS TO
 CONGRESS AND OBSTRUCTION OF
 JUSTICE AND WITNESS TAMPERING.
 STONE PLEADED NOT GUILTY.
 THERE IS NO CIRCUMSTANCE
 WHATSOEVER UNDER WHICH I BARE
 FAULT WITNESS.
 ROGER STONE IS WILLING TO
 COLOR OUTSIDE THE LINES IN A WAY
 THAT OTHER STRATEGISTS OR OTHER
 POLITICAL OPERATIVES MAY BE
 UNWILLING TO DO.
 STONE WAS NOT A MEMBER OF THE
 TRUMP CAMPAIGN STAFF, HE SERVED
 AS AN UNOFFICIAL ADVISER.
 HE CAME TO MUELLER AFTER
 BRAGGING IN 2016 THAT HE WAS
 COMMUNICATING DIRECTLY WITH
 WIKILEAKS FOUNDER, JULIAN
 ASSANGE.
 ASSANGE BECAME A FACTOR OF JUNE
 2016 WHEN HE MADE AN
 ANNOUNCEMENT ON BRITISH
 TELEVISION.
 WE HAVE E-MAILS ABOUT HILLARY
 CLINTON.
 ACCORDING TO FORMER TRUMP'S
 LAWYER, MICHAEL COHEN, BEFORE
 WIKILEAKS RELEASED ANY OF THOSE
 E-MAILS, ROGER STONE CALLED
 DONALD TRUMP.
 MR. STONE TOLD MR. TRUMP, HE
 GOTTEN OFF THE PHONE WITH MR.
 JULIAN ASSANGE.
 MR. ASSANGE TOLD MR. STONE THAT
 IN A COUPLE OF DAYS, THERE WILL
 BE A MASSIVE DUMP OF E-MAILS
 THAT WOULD DAMAGE HILLARY
 CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN.
 THAT'S ROGER TRYING TO BE
 REMAINING RELEVANT TO TRUMP.
 SOON AFTER THAT ALLEGED PHONE
 CALL, WIKILEAKS BEGAN ITS FIRST
 DUMP OF HACK MATERIAL.
 THIS WEEKEND, WIKILEAKS
 RELEASED NEARLY 20,000 E-MAILS
 SENT AND RECEIVED BY MEMBERS OF
 DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE.
 CAMERAS CAPTURED STONE ON AUGUST
 8th, TELLING AN AUDIENCE IN
 SOUTHERN FLORIDA ABOUT HIS
 CONNECTION WITH ASSANGE.
 I HAVE COMMUNICATED WITH
 ASSANGE.
 ON OCTOBER 7th, THE DAY OF THE
 INFAMOUS "ACCESS HOLLYWOOD"
 TAPE.
 A MASSIVE DOCUMENT DUMP FROM
 WIKILEAKS OF WHAT APPEARS TO BE
 HACKED E-MAILS FROM CLINTON'S
 CAMPAIGN, JOHN PODESTA'S G-MAIL
 ACCOUNT.
 ACCORDING TO HIS INDICTMENT,
 HE RECEIVED A MESSAGE FROM THE
 CAMPAIGN OFFICIAL SAYING
 WELL-DONE.
 SINCE 2016, ROGER STONE
 DENIED SPEAKING DIRECTLY WITH
 JULIAN ASSANGE.
 THERE IS NO SUGGESTION OR ANY
 COURT DOCUMENTS THAT ROGER STONE
 WAS DIRECTLY IN TOUCH WITH
 ASSANGE.
 STONE MAY HAVE HAD DIRECT
 DEALINGS WITH JULIAN ASSANGE.
 THAT'S NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE.
 THE CENTRAL QUESTION WHETHER THE
 RUSSIANS CONSPIRE WITH TRUMP OR
 WITH HIS CAMPAIGN OR OFFICIALS
 ON THAT CAMPAIGN INTERFERE IN
 OUR ELECTION.
 STONE HAS JOINED THE GROWING
 LIST OF TRUMP'S ASSOCIATES.
 GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS, A FOREIGN
 POLICY OF THE CAMPAIGN CONVICTED
 O F LYING TO THE FBI.
 HE MET WITH RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE
 OFFICERS WHO TOLD HIM THE
 RUSSIANS HAD HILLARY CLINTON'S
 MISSING E-MAILS.
 WE DON'T KNOW WHO IN THE
 TRUMP CAMPAIGN HE INFORMED, HE
 CLAIMED HE DID NOT REMEMBER WHO
 HE SHARED WITH.
 HE ONCE TOLD ME ROBERT MUELLER
 KNOWS.
 THE CLUES CAME OUT IN A
 RECENT FILINGS BY PAUL
 MANAFORT'S ATTORNEY.
 MANAFORT SHARED POLLING DATA
 THROUGH KILIMNIK WHO HAS WORKED
 FOR RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE AND
 THEY PASSED THAT POLLING DATA
 OFF DURING THE CAMPAIGN.
 THIS IS THE BEST EXAMPLE THAT
 WE HAVE SEEN, WHY WOULD A RUSSIA
 NEED INTERNAL POLLING DATA IF
 NOT TO HELP TO MANIPULATE THE
 ELECTION.
 OTHER PEOPLE SAY IT COULD BE
 NOTHING.
 THE LARGER QUESTION MAY BE
 HOW SO MANY PEOPLE IN ONE
 CAMPAIGN ENDED UP COMMUNICATING
 WITH RUSSIA.
 AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AT
 WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS PARTICULAR
 INVESTIGATION ARE TIES TO
 RUSSIA.
 IS THAT AN ACCIDENT?
 I DON'T THINK SO.
 COMING UP, THE PRESIDENT
 FIGHTS ROBERT MUELLER AT EVERY
 TURN.
     Last years' ad campaign
        was a success for         ChoiceHotels.com
     Badda Book. Badda Boom.
    This year, we're taking it           up a notch.
   So in this commercial we see          two travelers
   at a Comfort INN with a glow           around them,
 so people watching will be like,
      "wow, maybe I'll glow       too if I book direct
      at ChoiceHotels.com".
            Who glows?
      Just say, Badda Book.           Badda Boom.
          Nobody glows.
           He gets it.
     <i> Always the lowest price,</i>
           <i> guaranteed.</i>
   <i> Book now at ChoiceHotels.com</i>
         <i> No more excuses</i>         <i> with Cologuard.</i>
    We all make excuses for the    things we don't want to do.
       But when it comes to     colon cancer screening...
        I'm not doin' that.
       I eat plenty of kale.
     Ahem, as I was saying...
        ...with Cologuard,    you don't need an excuse...
          All that prep?            No thanks.
    That drink tastes horrible!
         But...there's no      prep with Cologuard...
         I can't take the          time off work.
         Who has two days?
         And I feel fine           no symptoms!
        Everybody, listen!
         All you need is a       trip to the bathroom.
       If you're 50 or older       and at average risk,
         Cologuard is the        noninvasive option
          that finds 92%         of colon cancers.
         You just get the         kit in the mail,
       go to the bathroom,       collect your sample,
     then ship it to the lab!
        This is your year!
              Own it!
     <i> Cologuard is not right</i>         <i> for everyone.</i>
       <i> It is not for high</i>       <i> risk individuals,</i>
     <i> including those with a</i>     <i> history of colon cancer</i>
   <i> or precancer, IBD, certain</i>  <i> hereditary cancer syndromes,</i>
       <i> or a family history</i>        <i> of colon cancer.</i>
  <i> Ask your doctor if Cologuard</i>       <i> is right for you.</i>
     <i> Covered by Medicare and</i>      <i> most major insurers.</i>
 FAKE NEWS OF THE RUSSIAN WITCH HUNT.
 SINCE TAKING OFF IN 2017,
 PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS PUBLICLY
 ATTACKED THE RUSSIA
 INVESTIGATION, LED BY SPECIAL
 COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER MORE THAN
 A THOUSAND TIMES.
 THE PRESIDENT IS TAKING ALL
 KINDS OF STEPS TO UNDERMINE THE
 FBI AND LAW ENFORCEMENT.
 HE DISPARAGES FACT FINDINGS
 AND DISPARAGES ANYONE WHO SAYS
 ANYTHING HE DOES NOT LIKE.
 HE CALLS THEM LIARS.
 WHAT'S HAPPENING IS A
 DISGRACE AND AT SOME POINT I
 WANT TO STAY OUT BUT AT SOME
 POINT IF IT DOES NOT STRAIGHTEN
 OUT PROPERLY, I WANT THEM TO DO
 THEIR JOB, I WILL GET INVOLVED
 AND I WILL GET IN THERE IF I
 HAVE TO.
 HE ARGUED THAT THE FBI IS
 LOOKING AT HIM WHEN THEY SHOULD
 BE LOOKING AT HILLARY CLINTON
 AND HE CAN WHIP UP HIS
 SUPPORTERS AT HIS RALLY WHEN HE
 TALKS ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION
 AND PAINTS HIMSELF AS SOMEONE
 BEING VICTIMIZED BY THIS.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ARGUMENT IS
 THAT MUELLER AND HIS TEAM ARE
 OUT TO GET HIM FOR PURELY
 POLITICAL REASONS.
 I CALL HIM THE ANGRY
 DEMOCRAT.
 IT IS AN UNFAIR THING FOR THIS
 COUNTRY.
 HE BEGAN RIGHT AT THE
 BEGINNING ATTACKING
 INVESTIGATIONS ON THE GROUND
 THAT MUELLER SURROUNDED HIMSELF
 WITH DEMOCRATS AND WITHOUT
 KNOWING THE FACT THAT THERE WERE
 REPUBLICANS.
 ROBERT MUELLER IS A REGISTERED
 REPUBLICAN.
 ROBERT MUELLER REMAINED TIGHT
 LIFT.
 WORKING FOR MUELLER, SOMEONE
 WHO DO NOT TOLERATE AND WOULD
 NEVER AUTHORIZE ANY TYPE OF LEAK
 TO THE MEDIA.
 HE HAD SUCH A REPUTATION IN THAT
 REGARD.
 IT IS NOT ONLY LAW
 ENFORCEMENT TARGETED IN TRUMP'S
 ATTACKS.
 THE PRESIDENT TRUMP TRIED TO
 DISCREDIT WITNESSES, EVEN THOSE
 IN HIS INNER CIRCLE INCLUDING
 MICHAEL COHEN.
 HE TRIES TO INTIMIDATE, HE
 CALLS MICHAEL COHEN A RAT AND A
 SNITCH.
 WHO TALKS LIKE THAT?
 AT FIRST WHEN THE FBI
 SEARCHED MICHAEL COHEN'S HOME,
 HOTEL AND OFFICE IN APRIL OF
 2018, THE PRESIDENT DEFENDED
 COHEN.
 I JUST HEARD THAT THEY BROKE
 INTO THE OFFICE OF MICHAEL
 COHEN'S, ONE OF MY PERSONAL
 ATTORNEYS, GOOD MAN.
 IT IS A DISGRACEFUL SITUATION
 AND IT IS A TOTAL WITCH HUNT.
 I HAVE BEEN SAYING IT FOR A LONG
 TIME.
 AUGUST 21st, 2018, A
 CONSEQUENTIAL DATE FOR THE
 PRESIDENT WITHIN HOURS FOR PAUL
 MANAFORT'S CONVICTION IN FEDERAL
 COURT.
 COHEN PLEADED GUILTY IN
 CONNECTION WITH HUSH MONEY
 PAYMENT MADE DURING THE CAMPAIGN
 TO TWO WOMEN WHO CLAIMED AFFAIRS
 WITH DONALD TRUMP.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP DENIED HE HAD AN
 AFFAIR WITH STORMY DANIELS AND
 WHEN IT CAME TO THE ALLEGED
 AFFAIR WITH PLAYBOY MODEL KAREN
 McDOUGAL, THE WHITE HOUSE CALLED
 IT WHITE HOUSE CALLED IT FAKE
 NEWS.
 IN LATE NOVEMBER ANOTHER TOUGH
 DAY FOR THE PRESIDENT.
 MICHAEL COHEN AGREED TO
 COOPERATE WITH THE RUSSIA PROBE.
 DRAWING THE PRESIDENT'S IRE.
 HE'S A WEAK PERSON.
 WHAT HE IS TRYING TO DO IS GET A
 REDUCED SENTENCE.
 HE'S LYING.
 ONE OF THE PRESIDENT'S
 PATTERN HAS BEEN CRITICIZE
 PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN COOPERATING
 WITH MUELLER OR TESTIFYING
 CALLING THM LIARS AND WEAK.
 SAYING THEY WANT TO CUT DEALS
 JUST TO SAVE THEIR OWN SKIN.
 AND YOU HAVE THE SELF-INFLICTED
 WOUNDS THE FBI BROUGHT UPON
 ITSELF.
 GRILLING ROSENSTEIN OVER TEXT
 MESSAGES.
 ONE OF THE OFFICIALS WAS
 PETER STRZOK.
 HE LED THE INVESTIGATION TO 2016
 INTO HILLARY CLINTONS MISSING
 E-MAILS BEFORE BEING ASSIGNED TO
 THE RUSSIA PROBE ALONG WITH LISA
 PAGE THE FOLLOWS YEAR.
 THEY WERE TEXTING ONE
 ANOTHER.
 MANY TIMES A DAY ON FBI DEVICES.
 SOME TEXTS WERE CRITICAL OF
 DONALD TRUMP AND ERUPTED INTO A
 SCANDAL.
 WE HAVE THEIR TEXT MESSAGES.
 WHAT THEY SAID WAS SHOCKING.
 WHEN YOU THOUGHT ABOUT BIAS.
 THIS WAS CATNIP FOR TRUMP.
 PARTISAN DEMOCRATS ATTACKING ME.
 I TOLD YOU THIS WAS A WITCH
 HUNT.
 THE MEDIA IS ALSO A FREQUENT
 TARGET OF PRESIDENT TRUMP
 ATTACKS.
 THEY ARE THE FAKE DISGUSTING
 NEWS.
 IT'S RIGHT OUT OF PUTIN'S
 PLAY BOOK HOW HE HANDLES THE
 MEDIA.
 TRYING TO MAKE IT AWE'RE
 EVERYTHING THEY PRINT IS FAKE
 AND NOT THE REAL NEWS.
 MOST HARD CORE TRUMP
 SUPPORTERS ACCEPTED HIS FRAME
 THAT EVERYTHING OF WHAT THE
 RUSSIA INFORMATION IS FAKE AND
 TUNE IT OUT.
 COMING UP.
 WHATEVER IS IN THE MUELLER
 REPORT, THERE ARE STILL OTHER
 LEGAL CHALLENGES THAT THE
 PRESIDENT FACES.
 THAT WOULD SEND CHILLS DOWN
 MY SPINE.
    Look LiMu. A civilian      buying a new car.
            Let's go.
          LiMu's right.

 So, we re-imagined the razor with the new Gillette SkinGuard.
      It has a unique guard      between the blades.
   That's designed to reduce   irritation during the shave.
  Because we believe all men  deserve a razor just for them.

 IT'S BEEN ONE OF THE MOST ANALYZED, SCRUTINIZED, AND
 CRITICIZED INVESTIGATIONS IN
 MODERN POLITICAL HISTORY.
 WASHINGTON IS NOW IN EAGER
 ANTICIPATION MODE FOR THE
 COMPLETION OF THE MUELLER
 REPORT.
 IT'S EXPECTED THAT THE REPORT
 WILL SOON BE IN THE HANDS OF
 ATTORNEY GENERAL WILLIAM BAR.
 ANY POTENTIAL HISTORY ALTERING
 CONTENTS ARE A MYSTERY.
 SO WHEN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
 GETS IT, THEN WHAT?
 HE'S GOING TO REVIEW IT AND
 MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S NOT
 SENSITIVE INFORMATION GRAND JURY
 MATERIAL.
 SOURCES AND METHODS THAT ARE
 CLASSIFIED.
 THERE MAYBE A PLAUSIBLE CLAIM OF
 EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE.
 WITH RESPECT TO THE MATERIAL.
 SOMETIMES CRIMINAL
 INVESTIGATIONS CAN HURT THE
 PRIVACY AND TRUST OF INDIVIDUALS
 AND THE EXAMPLE WE WERE DEALING
 WITH IN REALTIME IN 1999 WAS THE
 LIEU INSKI ALLEGATION DUMPED ON
 CONGRESS.
 FOR THAT REASON WE GAVE THE
 ATTORNEY GENERAL DISCRETION OVER
 WHAT TO GIVE TO CONGRESS.
 THE REGULATIONS DON'T MAKE
 CLEAR EXACTLY HOW THE ATTORNEY
 GENERAL IF AT ALL WILL SUMMARIZE
 THE MUELLER REPORT.
 HE COULD HAVE A NEWS CONFERENCE
 AND TALK ABOUT IT.
 WRITE HIS OWN REPORT.
 WE HAVE TO SEE WAS THERE
 ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO CONVICT?
 OR WASN'T THERE.
 YOU CAN'T SAY THERE WASN'T
 ENOUGH EVIDENCE.
 THAT'S NOT GOING TO FLY.
 I WOULD LIKE TO THINK BAR IS
 GOING TO ACT IN THE PUBLIC
 ENTLES AND RELEASE AS MUCH AS
 CONGRESS NEEDS TO MAKE THE
 DECISION THAT WILL HAVE BEFORE
 IT.
 EVEN IF THE ENTIRE REPORT IS
 RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC UNED ITD,
 THE CONTENT MAY NOT REVEAL ALL
 THAT MUCH.
 IT'S GOING TO BE VERY SPARE.
 IF MUELLER STICKS TO THE RULES
 AND IF THERE'S ONE THING MUELLER
 TENDS TO DO IT'S STICK TO THE
 RULES.
 REGULATIONS SAY THAT'S
 SUMMARY SHOULD BE VERY BRIEF.
 IF HE STICKS TO THE LETTER OF
 THE REGULAR.
 THERE WILL BE UNHAPPY PEOPLE.
 ONE POSSIBLE REASON IS ROBERT
 MUELLER COULD BE GIVE B A ROAD
 MAP TO FUTURE INVESTIGATIONS.
 THAT DON'T HAVE THE LIMITED
 SCOPE HE'S BEEN WORKING UNDER
 AND HANDING THEM DOCUMENTED
 EVIDENCE OF POSSIBLE CRIMINAL
 BEHAVIOR.
 THE STATES THE LOCAL DISTRICT
 ATTORNEY, CONGRESS, AND U.S.
 ATTORNEYS OFFICES ALL MAYBE
 PICKING UP ON DIFFERENT
 INVESTIGATIVE LEADS.
 THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
 CHAIRMAN NADLER SENT LETTERS TO
 81 INDIVIDUALS EXPANDING THAT ON
 THE INVESTIGATION AND LOOKING TO
 THESE THINGS SUCH AS DONALD
 TRUMP OTHERS BUSINESS DEALINGS.
 THEY ARE INTERESTED IN
 WHETHER HE HAS FINANCIAL
 CONSIDERATIONS WEIGHING ON HIM
 FROM FOREIGN GOVERNMENT.
 INFLUENCING HIS BEHAVIOR.
 THEY'RE NOT CONFINING THEMSELVES
 TO THE 2016 ELECTION ANYMORE.
 IT MAKES IT MUCH MORE
 DIFFICULT TO SHUT IT DOWN.
 PARTICULARLY IN THE SOUTHERN
 DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
 WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE
 SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK,
 THEY HAVE STILL LOOKING.
 AT INFORMATION REGARDING THE
 TRUMP ORGANIZATION, THE TRUMP
 CHARITY AND THE REVOCABLE TRUST
 AND OTHER MATTERS.
 THAT WOULD SEND CHILLS DOWN MY
 SPINE.
 ANOTHER AVENUE OF INTEREST.
 DOES THE PRESIDENT'S
 RECOLLECTION OF EVENTS ALIGN
 WITH OTHER WITNESS ACCOUNTS.
 TRURP DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE AN
 INTERVIEW TO ROBERT MUELLER AND
 HE DIDN'T.
 HE DID GIVE WRITTEN ANSWERS.
 AND IT'S CURIOUS WHY ROBERT
 MUELLER WOULD ACCEPT THAT.
 AND ONE REASON WOULD BE HE CAN
 PIN TRUMP DOWN TO HIS STORY.
 IF THEN ROBERT MUELLER COULD
 DISPROVE WITH EVIDENCE AND HAVE
 DONALD TRUMP ON PERJURY.
 WHOEVER AND WHATEVER COMING
 OUT OT REPORT.
 EXPECT A WHITE HOUSE REBUTLE.
 THEY PREPARED A COUNTER
 REPORT.
 WHAT THEY MEAN IS ALL THE WAYS
 IN WHICH THEY CAN ATTACK THE
 INVESTIGATION.
 THE TEXT BETWEEN THE FBI AGENT
 AND THE THE AGENT HE WAS HAVING
 AFFAIR.
 WHERE THEY SHOWED BIAS.
 THEY WANT TO SUMMARIZE IT AND
 ARGUE THE INVESTIGATION IS
 ILLEGITIMATE.
 THAT PLAYS TO THEIR BASE.
 HE CREATES AN ATMOSPHERE WHERE A
 THIRD OF THE COUNTRY IS NOT
 GOING TO BELIEVE ANYTHING
 MUELLER SAYS.
 THE MUELLER PROBE.
 ARGUABLY THE MOST SIGNIFICANT
 INVESTIGATION IN THE COUNTRY
 HISTORY.
 INDICTED 34 INDIVIDUALS.
 THERE HAVE BEEN CONVICTIONS OF
 HIGH LEVEL TRUMP ASSOCIATES.
 AN
