 So, we re-imagined the razor with the new Gillette SkinGuar
      It has a unique guard      between the blades.
   That's designed to reduce   irritation during the shave.
  Because we believe all men  deserve a razor just for them.

 SFWLI MY THANKS TO YOU FOR
 WATCHING. THAT DOES IT FOR OUR HOUR, "MTP
 DAILY" STARTS NOW.
 IT WAS A SLOW NEWS DAY ABOUT
 AN HOUR AGO, AND THEN YOU KNOW
 WHAT HAPPENED?
 WE GOT SOME NEWS.
 IF IT IS MONDAY WE HAVE BREAKING
 NEWS ABOUT IMPEACHMENT.
 GOOD EVENING, I'M KATY TUR IN
 FOR CHUCK TODD, THE PRESIDENT
 REPORTEDLY TOLD VOTERS THAT THE
 DEMOCRATS HATE JEWISH PEOPLE.
 AND BOB MUELLER COULD BE
 DELIVERING HIS REPORT TO THE
 JUSTICE DEPARTMENT REALLY ANY
 MINUTE.
 BUT WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH
 BREAKING NEWS BECAUSE AT A
 MOMENT WHEN EVERYONE WANTS TO
 KNOW IF BOB MUELLER'S REPORT
 WILL INCLUDE POTENTIALLY
 IMPEACHABLE OFFENSES, SPEAKER OF
 THE HOUSE NANCY PELOSI BASICALLY
 SAID THAT THE DEMOCRATS WILL NOT
 MOVE TO IMPEACH THE KNOT MATTER
 WHAT THE REPORT FINDS.
 SHE SAYS I'M NOT FOR
 IMPEACHMENT.
 THIS IS NEWS, I'M GOING TO GIVE
 YOU SOME NEWS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE
 I HAVE NOT SAID THIS TO ANY
 PRESS PERSON BEFORE, BUT SINCE
 YOU ASKED AND I HAVE BEEN
 THINKING ABOUT THIS, IMPEACHMENT
 IS SO DIVISIVE, I DON'T THINK WE
 SHOULD GO DOWN THAT PATH, HE IS
 NOT WORTH IT.
 PELOSI SAID THE PRESIDENT IS
 UNFIT FOR OFFICER AND SEVEN IN
 TEN DEMOCRATS THAT VOTED IN THE
 MIDTERM SAID THAT CONGRESS
 SHOULD IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT AND
 THAT WAS BEFORE THERE WAS ANY
 HARD EVIDENCE, AND NOW THE
 DEMOCRATIC LEADER IS ALL BULL
 RULING IT OUT.
 JOINING TONIGHT'S PANEL, THE
 "N YORK TIMES" POLITICAL
 REPORTER AND MSNBC POLITICAL
 ANALYST NICK CONFISCORY.
 GARRETT, HOW IS THIS GOING TO
 RESONATE ON CAPITOL HILL?
 I THINK THERE WILL BE TWO
 GROUPS HERE AMONG DEMOCRATS IN
 PARTICULAR, THOSE THAT ARE
 FRUSTRATED, A LOT OF THE YOUNGER
 AND NEWER DEMOCRATS THAT MADE IT
 CLEAR THEY WANT TO GO DOWN THE
 PATH OF IMPEACHMENT.
 THEY WILL BE FRUSTRATED, AND
 THERE IS ANOTHER GROUP OF FOLK
 THAT'S ARE FRANKLY TIRD OF
 BEING ASKED THIS QUESTION.
 AND I THERE ARE TWO IMPORTANT
 CAVEATS.
 THAT UNLESS THE EVIDENCE IS
 COMPELLING AND BIPARTISAN, SHE
 IS NOT WILLING TO GO DOWN THIS
 PATH.
 THAT REMAINS A POSSIBILITY.
 SHE IS NOT SLAMMING THE DOOR
 HERE ENTIRELY.
 IN THE LEAD UP TO THE ANSWER SHE
 SAID THIS IS NOT MAKING NEWS,
 PELOSI HAS BEEN PRETTY CLEAR
 FROM THE PODIUM AND OTHER AREAS
 THAT SHE DOESN'T WANT TO RACE
 HEADLONG INTO IMPEACHMENT.
 THEY HAVE BEEN VERY DELIBERATE
 ABOUT THE PACING OF THEIR
 AMBITIONS.
 THEY DON'T WANT TO BE SEEN AS
 JUST GOING AGAINST DONALD TRUMP,
 AND THE OTHER CAVEAT IS THAT HE
 IS JUST NOT WORTH IT.
 THERE IS SO MUCH CONFIDENCE
 AMONG DEMOCRATS THAT HE CAN BE
 BEATEN AT THE BALLOT BOX THAT IT
 IS NOT IMPORTANT TO GALVANIZE
 HIS SUPPORTERS AND RUNNING INTO
 A BRICK WALL IN THE SENATE IF
 THEY DON'T HAVE THE GOODS TO
 HAVE CONVICTED ON THE SENATE
 SIDE.
 WHY DO IT NOW, NICK?
 SHE KNEW IT WOULD MAKE NEWS.
 EVERYONE IS WAITING FOR THE
 MUELLER REPORT.
 EVERYONE THINKS THERE WILL BE A
 PIVOT POINT.
 AND I THINK THAT IS CORRECT.
 UNLESS THERE IS SOMETHING THAT
 MAKE THEM, MAKE THE REPUBLICANS
 WANT AN IMPEACHMENT.
 A LOT OF COLLEAGUES SAID WE
 HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL ROBERT
 MUELLER COMES OUT WITH THE
 REPORT, AND SHE IS ALL BUT
 TAKING THAT OFF OF THE TABLE.
 YEAH, I DON'T KNOW, THE FULL
 SCOPE OF WHAT SHE IS THINKING
 FOR STRATEGY.
 MOST AMERICANS, 70% OF AMERICANS
 SAY WE WANT SOMETHING TO BE
 DONE.
 THAT'S WHY WE VOTED FOR
 DEMOCRATS IN 2018.
 I DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW IF YOU
 P
 POLLED THE SAME PEOPLE, IF THEY
 KNEW THAT IMPEACHMENT IS A TWO
 STEP PROCESS, PERHAPS THAT
 POLING WOULD HAVE BEEN
 DIFFERENT.
 YOU THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
 LESS FAVORABLE?
 RIGHT, I DON'T THINK
 AMERICANS REALIZE THAT
 IMPEACHING HIM DOESN'T MEAN
 YOU'RE REMOVING HIM FROM OFFICE.
 BUT YOU'RE SURFACING EVIDENCE
 AND YOU'RE PRESENTING A CASE
 THAT IS EITHER COMPELLING ENOUGH
 OR NOT.
 THAT IS TRUE, BUT I THINK
 THAT SUBSEQUENTLY WHAT THEY'RE
 DOING IS IT ALMOST SERVES THE
 SAME PURPOSE.
 OF -WE HAVE LEGALLY CTRUM
 SIGNIFICANT INFORMATION THAT IS
 NEW BASED ON REPORTING FROM LAST
 WEEK THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE.
 SO I THINK THAT EACH NEW PIECE
 IS PUT IN THE BUCKET OF DID O
 NOT REELECT THIS PERSON, AND
 PERHAPS THE VOTERS WILL BE DOING
 THE REMOVING.
 IT IS CONGRESS'S RIGHT
 ACCORDING TO THE CONSTITUTION TO
 IMPEACH HIM FOR HIGH CRIMES AND

 MISDEMEANORS.
 WE HAVE FAIRLY CONCLUSIVE
 EVIDENCE THAT HE COMMITTED ONE
 OF THOSE CRIMES VIA MICHAEL
 COHEN, THROUGH THE CAMPAIGN VIE
 NANS VIOLATIONS.
 FACT IS THAT IT IS STILL
 EXTRAORDINARY, A BLACK MARK ON
 ANY PRESIDENCY.
 ANDREW JOHNSON OR BILL CLINTON.
 IF THAT'S WHAT LAW REQUIRES,
 THAT'S WHAT OUGHT TO BE DONE.
 NANCY PELOSI IS ALSO A
 CONSTITUTIONAL FIGURE.
 AND SHE HAS OBLIGATIONS THAT --
 SHE SAYS SHE BELIEVES HE
 VIOLATED THE CONSTITUTION.
 SHE SAID HE IS JUST NOT WORTH
 IT, HERE IS THE OTHER UP WITH,
 HOLD ON, I HAVE IT, ARE WE
 TALKING ETHICALLY.
 SHE WAS ASKED IF HE WAS FIT TO
 BE PRESIDENT, ETHICALLY UNFIT,


 INTELLECTUALLY UNFIT, AND --
 YEAH, THIS IS ALL A MATTER OF
 OPINION, BUT HE HAS TAKEN AN
 OATH OF OFFICE AND IS HE
 FULFILLING THAT OATH OF OFFICE
 AND HE IS NOT.
 BUT BY SAYING THIS, IF SHE IS
 RULING OUT IMPEACHMENT, IS SHE
 SAYING THE PRESIDENT IS ABOVE
 THE LAW FOR THE REST OF HIS
 TERM?
 NO, I THINK SHE IS GOING TO
 FOCUS ON THE ELECTIONING, AN
 INSTEAD OF CALLING IT
 IMPEACHMENT IT WILL GIVE HIM
 AMMUNITION.
 IS THIS BECAUSE IN 2020 THEY
 WANT TO FOCUS ON IDEAS AND NOT
 SUCK UP ALL OF THE OXYGEN AND
 FOCUS ON IMPEACHING THE
 PRESIDENT.
 I THINK IT IS TELEVISED
 HEARINGS.
 IT IS WATER GATE --
 SO ISN'T THAT GIVING HIM A
 POLITICAL FOOTBALL?
 NO, IT IS TOO, YOU CAN'T COIN
 IT IN ONE WORD, RIGHT?
 YOU CAN'T SAY THE DEMOCRATS ARE
 TRYING TO IMPEACH ME AS OPPOSED
 TO THE DEMOCRATS ARE CONDUCTING
 OVERSIGHT IN A VARIETY OF AREAS.
 BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE
 HIM MORE AMMUNITION, I'M NOT
 SAYING I AGREE 100% WITH THE
 STRATEGY.
 I HAVE GRAPPLED WITH THE THOUGHT
 THAT MAYBE YOU IMPEACH HIM SET A
 STANDARD, BUT I DON'T THINK IT
 WILL SUCCEED BECAUSE THERE IS NO
 CHANCE IN THE SENATE.
 MAYBE THAT IS WHERE WE NEED TO
 PUT OUR FOCUS AND MAYBE START
 ASKING HARD QUESTIONS TO MITCH
 McCONNELL.
 FIST OF ALL, SHE CAN TAKE
 THIS BACK WHEN EVER SHE WANTS,
 SFLIEGT IF THE PROSECUTIONS COME
 OUT WITH SOMETHING
 EXTRAORDINARY, SHE IS CAY THAT
 IS WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT.
 SECOND WHAT IS THE MOST LIKELY
 WAY FOR HER TO HOLD AN STAND
 OUR -SOME TIME IN THE FALL OF

 IS IT TRYING HIS HIGH CRIMES IN
 THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION.
 AND I'M NOT SURE IT HELPS THEM
 TO DO THIS.
 I THINK THE AMERICAN PUBLIC
 IS LOOKING FOR A PARTY THAT IS
 NOT CYNICAL, EVEN IN THE LAW,
 AND IS NOT ALWAYS OPERATING
 ACCORDING TO A MEDICAL
 CALCULATION.
 I THINK THAT KIND OF POLITICS
 THAT SAYS THE PRESIDENT VIOLATED
 A LAW, THERE IS A PENALTY
 MANDATED IN  CONSTITUTION, IF
 IT DOESN'T PASS THE SENATE, THAT
 WILL BE A SHAME ON THE
 REPUBLICANS THEN.
 IF DEMOCRATS AND PEOPLE
 ACCUSE THE REPUBLICANS OF
 PUTTING PARTY OVER COUNTRY BY
 NOT REALLY INVESTIGATING THE
 PRESIDENT, NOT ASKING HIM
 QUESTIONS, AND PUTTING POLITICS
 FIRST, CAN DEMOCRATS BE ACCUSED
 OF THE SAME THING?
 THEY'RE PUTTING POLITICS
 FIRST BECAUSE YOU NEED TO
 IMPEACH THIS PRESIDENT, YOU'RE
 WORRIED ABOUT THE 2020 CHANCES.
 DON'T SEE IT THAT WAY.
 IT IS PART OF THEIR
 CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY.
 I COULD SEE A SCENARIO WHERE YOU
 COULD ARGUE THAT THE EXPENSIVE
 ALLEGATIONS ARE WORTH IT.
 I JUST THINK THAT TO NICK'S
 POINT, IT IS A CALCULATION THAT
 MAY BE REQUIRED IN THIS MOMENT.
 DO WE WANT TO REALLY GO THROUGH
 AN IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDING WHERE
 THE PRIDENT CAN WAKE UP EVERY
 MORNING AND TWEET ABOUT
 HARASSMENT.
 WHAT PRECEDENT DOES THAT SET
 FOR THE FUTURE.
 THE LAST TIME WE WENT THROUGH
 IT WAS OVER SOMETHING SO MINUTE.
 EXACTLY, BUT IT IS NOT SO
 MINUTE.
 THIS ONE IS EASY TO EXPLAIN
 TO THE PUBLIC.
 THE PRESIDENT APPEARS TO HAVE
 PAID OFF A PORN STAR AND PLAYBOY
 MODEL, TO HELP HIMSELF WITH THE
 2016 ELECTION AND HE GOT AWAY
 WITH IT.
 IF AMERICANS WANT TO GO DOWN
 THAT RD THEY NEED TO MAKE IT
 AWARE TO THE DEMOCRATS, YOU CAN
 CALL NANCY PELOSI ON THE PHONE
 AND SAY I DEMAND THAT DEMOCRATS
 ACT ON THIS AND BEGIN
 IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS.
 KRISTIN WELKER, YOU HAVE THE
 REACTION FROM THE WHITE HOUSE,
 WHAT ARE THEY SAYING?
 PRETTY DEFIANT RESPONTS FROM
 SARAH HUCKABEE STANDARDS, I JUST
 SPOKE WITH HER AND ASKED HER TO
 RESPOND.
 SHE SAID LOOK IMPEACHMENT SHOULD
 NEVER BE ON THE TABLE BECAUSE
 THE PRESIDENT IS DOING A GREAT
 JOB.
 AND I PRESSED HER AND I SAID
 DOES THIS LOWER YOUR LEVEL OF
 CONCERN TO HEAR THE HOUSE
 SPEAKER SAY THIS?
 SARAH SANDERS SAID WE WITH
 RESPECT THAT CONCERNED, WE'RE
 FOCUSED ON DOING OUR JOBS.
 SHE TOOK A CHANCE TO TAKE A
 SWIPE AT PELOSI BECAUSE PELOSI
 IS QUITE CRITICAL OF THE
 PRESIDENT IN THAT INTERVIEW AS
 WELL.
 SHE SAID MOST AMERICANS AGREE
 WITH PELOSI, SO NOT SURPRISINGLY
 DEFIANCE FROM SARAH SANDERS, SHE
 HAS BEEN AND OF COURSE WE'RE
 AWAITING THAT ANY DAY NOW.
 SHE HAS LEFT HERSELF AND OUT
 AND LET'S JUST ALSO SAY THAT THE
 DEMOCRATS TOOK BACK THE HOUSE IN

 AND HE DIDN'T WIN THE
 MAJORITY OF VOTES IN 2016.
 BRING ME BACK TO THE PRESS
 DEBIT THAT IS BEING SET, AND IF
 THEY'RE NOT WILLING TO GO DOWN
 THIS PATH NOW, THEY WILL USE THE
 SAME ATTACKS AND CALL IT
 PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT.
 THAT ATTACK IS THERE, IT WILL
 ALREADY BE USED.
 THERE IS A NUMBER OF
 INVESTIGATIONS GOING ON IN

 CONGRESS.
 IS IT THAT MUCH WORSE.
 THEY LAID OUT THE CASE FOR
 WHY THERE IS A PRINCIPALED NEED.
 BUT THE POLITICAL CASE AGAINST
 IT --
 YOU COMMIT A CRIME IN OFFICE,
 SHOULDN'T THAT BE ENOUGH?
 SURE, BUT WE'RE IN A COUNTRY
 RIGHT NOW THAT IS SO POLARIZED
 THAT IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO
 PULL A CONSENSUS TO DO THIS
 HIGHLY POLITICAL ACT.
 AND ONE OF THE BEST THINGS FOR
 PRESIDENT TRUMP RIGHT NOW IS TO
 CONVINCE HIS VOTERS THAT HE IS
 THE OBJECT OF SOMETHING UNFAIR
 AND IT MAY BE THAT PELOSI IS CAL

  -CALCULATING THE BEST WAY --
 GARRETT, WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO
 DEMOCRATS.
 I THINK THE EFFECT OF THIS
 WILL RELIEF THAT POLITICAL BRSH
 ON SOME OF THESE DEMOCRATS THAT
 DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT
 IMPEACHMENT EVERY DAY AND IT
 WILL FIRE UP THOSE THAT DO, ALL
 OF THIS WAS GOING TO PLAY OUT IN
 A IN A WAY THAT COMES OVER THE
 NEXT FEW MONTHS ANYWAY.
 THERE IS ALREADY EXPANSIVE
 INVESTIGATIONS.
 AND IN THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE,
 YOU DON'T HAVE TO CALL IT
 IMPEACHMENT.
 PELOSI LEFT HERSELF AN ENORMOUS
 TRAP DOOR TO COME BACK OUT OF
 THIS LATER IF THE EVIDENCE TURNS
 UP COMPELLING.
 BUT WHAT IS THE PRECEDENT
 THAT YOU'RE SETTING FOR THE
 FUTURE IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO
 IMPEACHMENT BUT NOT CALL IT
 IMPEACHMENT.
 IF YOU HAVE THE HEARING AND THE
 INVESTIGATIONS BUT YOU DON'T
 CALL IT IMPEACHMENT.
 IMPEACHMENT SHOULD WORK EVEN
 WHEN IT IS INCONVENIENT.
 AND I REMEMBER GEORGE W. BUSH
 SQUEAKING INTO OFFICER IN 2,000
 BY PROMISING TO RESTORE HONOR
 AND INTEGRITY TO THE WHITE
 HOUSE.
 GARRETT, HAAKE, THANK YOU
 VERY MUCH.
 COMING UP THE SPEAKER OF THE
 HOUSE DOES NOT SUPPORT
 IMPEACHMENT UNLESS THERE IS
 OVERWHELMING SUPPORT FOR IT.
 DOES SHE KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT
 THE MUELLER REPORT THAT WE DO
 NOT.
 WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THAT
 ASPECT AND MUELLER'S END GAME

 NANCY PELOSI NIECE NEW COMMENTS THAT SHE DOESN'T
 SUPPORT IMPEACHMENT COMES AS
 EVERYONE IS WAITING FOR ROBERT
 MUELLER'S REPORT.
 PERHAPS ANY MOMENT NOW, WE JUST
 DON'T KNOW.
 AS POLITICO REPORTS, THE WHITE
 HOUSE THIS AFTERNOON LEFT THE
 DOOR OPEN FOR THE PRESIDENT
 GOING NUCLEAR AND PARDONING PAUL
 MANAFORT, JUST TWO DAYS BEFORE
 WE FIND OUT LONG MANAFORT WILL
 SPEND IN PRISON.
 JOINING ME NOW IS JOHN BREN NAN.
 AND CHUCK ROSENBERG.
 THE SAME QUESTION TO BOTH OF YOU
 GENTLEMAN, IF NANCY PELOSI IS
 SAYING I'M PEACHMENT IS NOT
 WORTH IT, IS SHE ATTACHING DOWN
 EXPECTATIONS ABOUT THE MUELLER
 REPORT?
 COULD SHE KNOW SOMETHING THAT WE
 DON'T KNOW?
 SHE COULD, BUT I DON'T THINK
 SHE DOES, IT WAS SIR SURPRISING
 SHE CAME OUT WITH THIS DAYTIME.
 SHE DID LEAVE HERSELF AN OUT.
 SHE SAID UNLESS IT IS
 COMPELLING, I THINK WE ALREADY
 HAVE TWO BOXES CHECKED.
 I THINK THE BIPARTISAN BOX WILL
 NOT BE CHECKED FROM HER VIEW.
 AND IT IS NOT WHAT CONSTITUTION
 SAYS, BUT I THINK IT IS THE
 POLITICAL REALITIES OF
 WASHINGTON ON THE EVE OF A
 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION SHE
 DOESN'T WANT TO GO THROUGH A
 BRUISING FIGHT THAT WILL GET
 THROUGH THE HOUSE, BUT HIS STYLE
 IN THE SENATE WILL NOT BE
 SOMETHING THAT WILL END GIVEN
 THE REPUBLICANS DETERMINATION TO
 STAY WITH THEM.
 SO SHE IS GUESSING THAT
 WHATEVER MUELLER COMES OUT WITH
 IT WILL NOT BE ENOUGH TO
 CONVINCE REPUBLICANS SO LET'S
 MOVE ON FROM THIS?
 YEAH, AND I THINK IT IS
 BIPARTISAN, I THINK IT HAS TO BE
 SOMETHING THAT WILL BE NOW HAVE
 CONVINCE THE REPUBLICANS WHO
 HAVE JUST STUCK WITH TRUMP, AND
 SAY YES, THIS MEETING THE
 STANDARD OF HIGH CRIMES AND
 MISDEMEANORS AND HE NEEDS TO BE
 OUSTED FROM OFFICE.
 AT THIS POINT SHE IS TAMPING
 DOWN EXPECTATIONS SO THE HOUSE
 DEMOCRATS ARE FOCUS ON THEIR
 INVESTIGATIONS.
 I THINK JOHN IS RIGHT, NANCY
 PELOSI IS A GIFTED POLL DECISION
 MAKING A POLITICAL CALCULATION.
 I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY
 CHANCE SHEOULD KNOW WHAT IS
 INVOLVED IN MUELLER'S REPORT.
 BY REGULATION, AND MUELLER IS A
 REGULATION GUY, KATIE, HAS TO BE
 CONFIDENTIAL WHEN HE TRANSMITS
 IT TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.
 HE HAS NOT LEAKED A THING.
 HE IS RUNNING AN AIRTIGHT
 INVESTIGATION, THE NOTION THAT
 NANCY PELOSI KNOWS WHAT IS IN IT
 IS FANSFUL TO ME.
 WHAT WOULD EQUAL BAD FOR HIM,
 EQUAL A CRIME, LIKE GETTING ON
 THE PHONE T VLADIMIR PUTIN
 SAYING HELP ME WITH THESE
 E-MAILS SO I CAN TAKE DOWN
 HILLARY CLINTON.
 I THINK SINCE HE FACTED TO
 ABNORMALLY I THINK HE CON VEBSED
 A LOT OF PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON
 THAT ANYTHING THAT HE DOES DOES
 NOT REACH THAT BAR OF
 IMPEACHMENT.
 I THINK HE HAS BEEN INTENTIONAL
 ABOUT THAT.
 HE HAS GOT HIS BASE TO HOLD
 THEIR NOSE AND ALL OF THAT THAT
 IS CONSISTENT WITH THE
 PRESIDENT -I THINK THAT IS WHY
 SO MANY PEOPLE ARE DETERMINED TO
 STICK WITH IT.
 HE LOWERED THE BAR AND RAISED
 THE BAR AT THE SAME TIME.
 ADAM SCHIFF WAS ON YESTERDAY AND
 HE SOUNDED WORRIED.
 HE WAS SAYING ROBERT MUELLER
 SHOULD HAVE PRESIDENT TRUMP IN
 FRONT OF HIM AND HI SHOULD
 QUESTION HIM IN PERSON.
 LET'S LISTEN.
 I THINK ULTIMATELY IT IS A
 MISTAKE.
 THE BEST WAY TO GET THE TRUTH IS
 TO PUT THE PRESIDENT UNDER OATH
 BECAUSE HAS HE MADE CLAIM IN THE
 PAST, HE FEELS ITS PERFECTLY
 FINE TO LIE TO THE PUBLIC.
 CHUCK, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
 IN A TYPICAL INVESTIGATION,
 KATIE, YOU SAVE THE MOST
 IMPORTANT PEOPLE FOR LAST AND
 YOU TALK TO EVERYBODY.
 AND SO IT STRUCK ME AS ALMOST A
 NECESSITY THAT BOB MUELLER AND
 HIS TEAM TALK TO DONALD TRUMP

 EXCEPT FOR ONE THING WE DON'T
 KNOW THE FACTS.
 WE DON'T KNOW WHAT MUELLER
 KNOWS, AND WE FRANKLY DON'T KNOW
 WHETHER OR NOT THE PRESIDENT HAS
 REES OR NOT AGREED TO BE
 INTERVIEWED.
 BY THE WAY I DON'T KNOW IF BOB
 MUELLER WOULD WIN.
 THE SUPREME COURT WOULD REQUIRE
 A PRESIDENT TO GIVE NEW
 EVIDENCE.
 ASSUMING HE HAD A FIFTH
 AMENDMENT PRIF LENG, BUT I
 WORKED FOR BOB MUELLER AND FE HE
 DOESN'T WANT TO TALK TO BOB
 MUELLER I'M SURE HE HAS A GOOD
 REASON FOR THAT.
 CONSIDERING THE INVESTIGATION
 AND CONSIDERING THE NOVELTY
 THERE, IF THERE A REAL SWEAT FOR
 OUR PRESIDENT, THEY FOUND
 SOMETHING THERE, HOW LONG CAN
 YOU SIT ON THAT, CURRENTLY SIT
 ON THAT?
 IT JUST DEPENDS ON THE FACTS.
 IF IT IS SOMETHING FROM THE PAST
 THAT HAS BEEN UNCOVERED THAT
 DOES COMPROMISE THE NATIONAL
 SECURITY OF THIS COUNTRY I THINK
 IT IS A VALID QUESTION.
 SHOULD WITH ALLOW A INDIVIDUAL
 IN THE OVAL OFFICE THAT IS
 COMPROMISEBLE.
 WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCOF THIS
 INVESTIGATION ICE BERGE IS OUT
 THERE.
 I THINK HOW MUCH IS THERE AND
 WHAT WILL BE DETERMINED WILL BE
 DETERMINED BY WHAT WILL BE
 PRESENTED TO THE ATTORNEY
 GENERAL.
 THERE IS NOTHING THAT REQUIRES A
 PUBLIC STATEMENT TO GO OUT FROM
 THE SPECIAL COUNCIL'S TEAM
 SAYING WE HAVE TO DELIVER A
 REPORT TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.
 I THINK WILLIAM BARR WILL GET
 THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THIS.
 CHUCK, I BELIEVE, I THINK WE
 WERE TOLD WE WOULD GET SOME
 GUIDANCE FROM DOJ.
 WE JUST WOULD NOT HAVE ANY IDEA
 WHAT WAS IN THE REPORT
 IMMEDIATELY.
 BUT I THINK JOHNSON'S
 INSTINCTS ON THIS ARE RIGHT.
 HERE IS WHY.
 THE MUELLER REPORT IS REQUIRED
 TO BE CONFIDENTIAL.
 IT IS NOT IN THE ATTORNEY
 GENERAL'S INTEREST TO KNOW HE
 RECEIVED IT.
 ONCE WE KNOW HE RECEIVED IT WE
 START HAMMERING ON HIM, WHAT
 WILL YOU DO, WHAT WILL YOU MAKE
 PUBLIC?
 AND SO THOROUGH, IT IS ENTIRELY
 PLAUSIBLE, BUT IT IS PLAUSIBLE
 THAT HE TRANSMITTED IT AND WHEN
 HE DOES I IMAGINE THEY'RE NOT
 GOING TO ANNOUNCE THAT.
 I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT HELPS T
 ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT WOULD WANT
 TO TO READ IT, REFLECT ON IT,
 AND DETERMINE WHAT COULD BE
 PROPERLY TRANSMITTED TO THE
 CONGRESS AND MADE PUBLIC.
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S MARCHING
 ORDERS THAT GOVERNOR THIS REPORT
 MUST BE BRIEF AND MUELLER'S
 REPORT TO HIM MUST BE
 CONFIDENTIAL.
 WHAT IS ABOVE THE WATER RIGHT
 NOW IS ALL OF THE ACTION WE'RE
 GOING TO BE SEEING IN COURT THIS
 WEEK FROM THE VARIOUS PEOPLE
 LVED.
 ONE OF THOSE IS PAUL MFRT.
 THIS COULD DETERMINE HOW LONG HE
 WILL END UP STAYING IN PRISON.
 TODAY THE WHITE HOUSE WOULD NOT
 EXPLICITLY RULE OUT THAT PAUL
 MANAFORT WOULD NOT BE GIVEN A
 PARDON.
 RIGHT, PAUL MANAFORT SHOULD
 NOT BE DANCING IN THE END ZONE
 YET.
 HE GOT A LENIENT SENTENCE.
 HE IS LOOKING AT AN ADDITIONAL
 TEN YEARS.
 THE JUDGE THERE COULD RUN IT
 CONSECUTIVELY AND HE STILL HAS
 SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE, WHETHER OR
 NOT THE PRESIDENT WILL PARDON
 HIM IS ANOTHER MATTER, BUT HE
 SHOULD NOT BE DANCING IN THE
 OCCASION YET.
 I DON'T HAVE ANY DOUBT THAT
 MR. TRUMP WILL PARDON HIM AT
 SOME POINT.
 SO I BELIEVE THAT PAUL MANAFORT
 WILL BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF THE
 FEDERAL CHARGES, WHAT DOES HE
 HAVE TO LOSE IF HE PARDONS HIM.
 I THINK WHETHER OR NOT IT IS
 HIM LEAVING OFFICE.
 BUT HE HAS SPOKEN HIGHLY OF HIM.
 HE FEELS THIS INVESTIGATION HAS
 BEEN A WITCH HUNT.
 SO WHY WOULD DONALD TRUMP ALLOW
 HIM TO STAY IN JAIL.
 WHAT ABOUT MIKE FLYNN?
 WILL HE GET A PARDON AS WELL?
 ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE WITH
 TRUMP.
 HE USES THE POWERS AS HE WANTS

 TO.
 IF THERE ARE STATE CHARGES,
 THOSE COULD STICK, BUT FEDERAL
 CHARGES I THINK DONALD TRUMP
 WILL ULTIMATELY PARDON THEM.
 THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
 WE HAVE MORE ON THE NEWS OF
 NANCY PELOSI.
 WE HAVE A OUTSPOKEN DEMOCRATIC
 WHO IS A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE
 THAT WOULD START IMPEACHMENT
 PROCEEDINGS AND WE'LL GET HIS
 FIRST RESPONSE TO SPEAKER
 PELOSI, AHEAD.

 PROSPEROUS NATION ON EARTH.
 THIS CAMPAIGN IS NOT JUST
 ABOUT WHAT IS WRONG RIGHT NOW.
 IT IS ABOUT HAVING A VISION OF
 WHERE WE CAN BE.
 DEMOCRATS IN IOWA SAY THEY WANT
 TO BE INSPIRED.
 IN A NEW POLE OF LIKELY
 DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS GOERS, 83% SAY
 THEY WANT A CANDIDATE THAT WILL
 FOCUS AN HARNESSING THE COUNTRY.
 WHEN IT COMES TO THE ISSUES THAT
 MATTER TWO RISE TO THE TOP.
 HEALTH CARE, CLIMATE CHANGE.
 81% WAS CDIDATES TO TALK
 ABOUT HEALTH CARE AND THAT
 NUMBER IS 80% FOR CLIMATE
 CHANGE.
 JUST 22% SAY CANDIDATES SHOULD
 TALK A LOT ABOUT IMPEACHMENT.
 WE HAVE MORE "MTP DAILY" AND
 A POSSIBLE 2020 CANDIDATE AHEAD
 AFTER THIS BREAK.
                  A POSSIBLE 202 AFTER THIS BREAK
 O
 WELCOME BACK, LOTS OF
 BREAKING NEWS RIGHT NOW.
 NANCY PELOSI BASICALLY JUST SAID
 THE DEMTS WILL NOT MOVE TO
 IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT, JOHN
 BRENNAN TOLD ME THAT HE DOESN'T
 HAVE ANY DOUBT THAT THE
 PRESIDENT WILL PARDON PAUL
 MANAFORT.
 NANCY PELOSI SAYS TODAY THAT
 SHE DOESN'T THINK THE PRESIDENT
 IS WORTH IMPEACHING.
 IT IS TOO DI VISIVE, WHAT ARE
 YOUR THOUGHTS?
 NO SOMEONE ABOVE THE LAW, IF
 WE FIND HE BROKE THE LAW, WE
 WON'T HAVE A CHOICE.
 WE SHOULD MOVE TOWARD A
 CONCLUSION.
 I ALSO UNDERSTAND A SENTIMENT
 THAT THIS PRESIDENT, AT LEAST HE
 IS NOT WORTH TALKING ABOUT
 IMPEACHMENT UNTIL WE HAVE
 EVIDENCE BECAUSE THE AMERICAN
 PEOPLE WANT TO TALK ABOUT
 REDUCING THE COST OF
 PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, GETTING
 THEIR COMMUNITIES TO CONNECT,
 THERE IS A LOT WE CAN DO AND WE
 HAVE ALREADY DONE WITH
 BACKGROUND CHECKS AND UPDATING
 THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT.
 I THINK WE WILL STAY FOCUSED BUT
 HE IS NOT GETTING A FREE PASS.
 WHERE IS THE BAR, SHE SAYS
 IMPEACHMENT IS SO DIVISIVE THAT
 UNLESS THERE IS SOMETHING
 BIPARTISAN, I DON'T THINK WE
 SHOULD GO DOWN THAT PATH BECAUSE
 IT DIVIDES THE COUNTRY AND HE IS
 JUST NOT WORTH IT.
 BIPARTISAN IS AN OPERATIVE WORD
 IN THAT SENTENCE.
 YOU MIGHT FIND CRIMES, BUT DO
 YOU THINK THERE WILL BE A
 BIPARTISAN CONSENSUS TO IMPEACH
 HIM?
 OR IF MUELLER COMES OUT WIT
 SOMETHING EGREGIOUS IN THAT
 REPORT?
 THE VOTERS WILL CONTINUE TO
 THROW OUT ANYONE THAT DOESN'T
 STAND UP TO HIM.
 I THINK IT IS ALSO AN INDICTMENT
 ON SO MANY THAT ARE SO UNWILLING
 TO HOLD THIS PRESIDENT ACCOUNT
 POSSIBLE.
 CAN WE SAY HIS CONDUCT AFFECTS
 THEY'RE EVERY DAY LIVES?
 IS HE SELLING HOTEL ROOMS TO
 FOREIGN NATIONALS TO BENEFIT
 HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY, IS HE
 DIED TO A FOREIGN ADVERSARY.
 WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO DONALD
 TRUMP JUSTICE FOR TRUMP.
 WE'RE GOING TO FOLLOW THE RULE
 OF LAW THAT HE IS SO UNWILLING
 TO FOLLOW.
 BUT IF YOU NEED BIPARTISAN
 SUPPORT, DOES THAT MEAN EVERYONE
 HAS TO WAIT FOR THE ELECTION AND
 LET THE VOTERS DECIDE?
 I STILL HAVE HOPE, CALL ME
 NAIVE, THAT REPUBLICANS WILL SEE
 THIS CONDUCT IF IT CROSSES THE
 LINE THEY WILL STEP FORWARD AND
 THEY WILL DO WHAT THEY HAVE TO
 DO.
 MAYBE IT IS BETTER FOR THE
 VOTERS TO THROW HIM OUT.
 DONALD TRUMP WILL NOT BE THE
 PRESIDENT IN 2021.
 ASIDE FROM THE CORRUPTION WE'RE
 SEEING, TOO MANY PEOPLE PROMISED
 THEY WOULD DO BETTER AND INSTEAD
 THEY HAVE A TOP FLOOR ECONOMY.
 ALL OF THE BENEFITS HAVE STAYED
 ON THE TOP FLOOR, WE CAN INDICT
 WHAT ABOUT THE HUSH MONEY
 PAYMENTS?


 I THINK HE MAY BE GOING TO
 JAIL FOR THAT.
 BUT THAT'S NOT A CRIME THAT
 WOULD MAKE YOU PUT POLITICS
 SECOND AND THE CONSTITUTION
 FIRST?


 IT IS CERTAINLY A CRIME THAT
 WE SHOULD PURSUE, BUT I DON'T
 THINK THAT IS ALL WE HAVE AND I
 THINK WE HAVE PLENTY OF OTHER
 STUFF TO LOOK AT, I THINK THE
 AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT US TO FOCUS
 ON WHAT HE PROMISED THEM.
 CONNECTING THE DISCONNECT,
 MAKING SURE THE COMMUNITIES ALL
 HAVE GOOD SCHOOLS, FREE FROM GUN
 VIOLENCE, THAT IS WHAT WE WILL
 FOCUS ON, BUT HE IS DIFFERENT
 FROM WHAT HE WAS IN THE LAST FEW
 YEARS.
 NOW QUESTION CHECK AND PUT
 BALANCES AGAINST HIM AND THAT IS
 A BETTER PLACE THAN WE WERE
 BEFORE.
 ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT THE
 PRECEDENT THAT REPUBLICANS SET
 FIRST AND NOW REPUBLICANS MIGHT
 BE SETTING AS WELL FOR WHAT THE
 BAR IS FOR IMPEACHMENT FOR A
 FUTURE PRESIDENT?
 IF THIS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
 ATES,HERE IS A NUMBER OF
 ALLEGATIONS OUT THERE, BUT EVEN
 JUST WITH THE CAMPAIGN FINANCE
 VIOLATION, IF THAT ISN'T ENOUGH,
 ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT
 THAT MEANS GOING FORWARD?


 YEAH, I KNOW WHAT WE DO SETS
 THE PRECEDENT FOR FUTURE
 ADVISORS.
 SO YOU CAN AT LEAST GO TO THAT
 LINE.
 I KNOW SPEAKER PELOSI IS
 COGNIZANT OF THAT.
 WHAT WE SHOULD LOOK ATRIMARILY
 IS DOES HIS CONDUCT AFFECT OUR
 RULE OF LAW.
 DOES IT AFFECT OUR NATIONAL
 SECURITY IN THAT HE IS
 FINANCIALLY COMPROMISED.
 THAT'S WHAT I THINK WE SHOULD
 FOCUS ON THE MOST.
 IF HE CROSSED THOSE LINES WE
 WILL HAVE TO SUPPORT TO IMPEACH.
 THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES I THINK
 WE SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON AND HE
 HAS A CHECK ON HIM THAT HE
 DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE AND I THINK
 WE CAN BREATHE A SIGH OF RELIEF.
 ARE YOU GOING TO RUN FOR
 PRESIDENT.
 I'M CLOSE, I SEE SO MANY
 PEOPLE WORK HARD BUT THEY SEE A
 PROMISE OF AMERICA IS NOT COMING
 TO THEM.
 I WAS THE FIRST IN MY FAMILY TO
 GO TO COLLEGE.
 I SIGH IT ACROSS AMERICA THAT IS
 NOT TRUE IN TOO MANY PLACES.
 I THINK BEING GENERATIONAL,
 BRING OPTIMISM, GO BIG AND BE
 BOLD SOLUTION SO SO MANY
 ISSUES --
 SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE CLOSE TO A
 YES?
 YOU'RE GETTING ME PRETTY
 CLOSE HERE, KATY, BUT I WILL
 MAKE THE DECISION BY THE END OF
 THE MONT
 THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
 MY PLEASURE.
 COMING UP, JOHN BRENNAN JUST
 TOLD ME HE THINKS THE PRESIDENT
 WILL PARDON PAUL MANAFORT,
 REACTION IN JUST A MOMENT, STICK
 AROUND.

 AROUND

 WELCOME BACK, SOMETHING BIG IS BREWING IN MILWAUKEE.
 DEMOCRATS HAVE CHOSEN THE CITY
 AS THE SIGHT OF THE 2020
 NATIONAL CONVENTION.
 SORRY MIAMI BEACH AND HOUSTON.
 WHY NEWS MILWAUKEE?
 THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS THE
 PARTY OF WORKING PEOPLE AND
 MILWAUKEE IS THE CITY OF WORKING
 PEOPLE, BUT THERE IS SO MUCH
 MORE TO MILWAUKEE, RIGHT?
 RIGHT ALICE COOPER?
 DO YOU COME TO MILWAUKEE
 OFTEN?
 WELL, I'M A REGULAR VISITOR
 HERE, BUT MILWAUKEE CERTAINLY
 HAD THEIR SHARE OF VISITORS.
 THE FRENCH MISSIONARY AND
 EXPLORERS WERE COMING HERE AS
 EARLY AS THE 1600s TO TRADE WITH
 THE NEETIVE AMERICANS.
 ISN'T IT INDIAN NAME?
 YES, IT IS ACTUALLY
 PRONOUNCED MILWAUKEE.
                       MILWAUKEE

 IT IS TIME NOW FOR "THE LID."
 WE ALL WANT TO TALK ABOUT
 "WAYNE'SWORLD" BUT WE'RE NOT A
 AGO.
 I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW THIS.
 I HOPE YOU DID.
 HE SAID HE BELIEVES THAT DONALD
 TRUMP WILL ABSOLUTELY PARDON
 MANAFORT.
 HE SAYS WHAT WOULD BE -WHAT
 WOULD BE THE NEGATIVE FOR HIM IF
 HE DID?
 I MEAN, THE WRITING IS ON THE
 WALL.
 HE HAS TALKED ABOUT IT.
 WHAT DOES HE HAVE TO LOSE.
 THE WHITE HOUSE WON'T DENY
 IT.
 THE ONLY QUESTION IS WHETHER IT
 GETS THE PRESIDENT SOMETHING AT
 THIS POINT IN THE INVESTIGATION
 TO PARDON HIM.
 AND I DEPENDS A LOT ON WHAT THE
 PRESIDENT'S GAME THEORY OF WHAT
 MUELLER SAYS AND WANTS TO DO,
 AND ALREADY IS, I DON'T KNOW
 WHAT THAT IS.
 AND IF MUELLER COMES AT HIM,
 DOESN'T HAVE THE SMOKING GUN OR
 HAS THE SMOKING GUN AND HE IS
 NOT GETTING IMPEACHED, DOESN'T
 HE FEEL BULLETPROOF?
 I THINK HE PROBABLY FEELS
 THAT WAY ALREADY.
 IN TERMS I THINK OF MANAFORT,
 SOMETIMES I THINK WE MISSTATE
 THEIR RELATIONSHIP, BECAUSE
 DONALD TRUMP IS TELLING US WELL,
 HE WAS ONLY ON THE CAMPAIGN FOR
 A SKOUPLE OF DAYS.
 HE WAS ONLY THERE FOR 40
 SOMETHING DAYS.
 THEY'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR
 DECADES.
 THE IDEA THAT PAUL MANAFORT WHO
 WAS BUSINESS PARTNERS WITH ROGER
 STONE DOES NOT HAVE THAT
 DECADES-LONG RELATIONSHIP WITH
 THE PRESIDENT IN ORDER TO SET UP
 PARDON.
 IT'S NOT A SURPRISE TO ME
 THAT HE HAS A LOT OF EMPATHY FOR
 MANAFORT IN WAYS THAT HE DS
 NOT FOR OTHER FOLKS.
 I THINK IT'S SIMPLER THAN
 THAT.
 AND AS SOMEBODY WHO COVERED THE
 CAMPAIGN THAT.
 DIDN'T GET ALONG.
 THEY DIDN'T LIKE EACH OTHER.
 IT WAS ACRIMONIOUS WHILE HE WAS
 THERE.
 I THINK IT'S --
 DONALD TRUMP GET ALONG WITH
 ALL THE PEOPLE THAT WORKED FOR
 HIM?
 NO, HE YELLED AT EVERYBODY.
 BUT HE CERTAINLY GOT ALONG
 BETTER WITH SOME PEOPLE THAN HE
 GOT ALONG WITH MANAFORT.
 A REPUBLICAN CAMPAIGN.
 EXACTLY.
 WHO WANTED TO BE THE T.
 THE STEVE BANNON KIND OF, THE
 CRAZY GUY STRATEGY.
 WAS MY OPINION IS IF HE DOES
 THAT, THE SIMPLER EXPLANATION IS
 THAT HE PARNS MANAFORT BECAUSE
 HE BELIEVES THE ENTIRE
 INVESTIGATION IS BS, AND BY
 PARDONING MANAFORT, HE IS
 WASHING HIMSELF OF THE CRIMES AS
 WELL.
 HE IS CLEANSING HIMSELF.
 THAT MIGHT BE HIS THEORY.
 THAT WOULDN'T BE A CORRECT
 THEORY BECAUSE PAUL MANAFORT WAS
 THE MANAGER WHILE RICK GATES WAS
 THE DEPUTY.
 HE STAYED FOR MUCH LONGER AND
 WILL SERIES COOPERATING.
 SURE, HE COULD SEE IT THAT WAY.
 I'M NOT SAYING THE REALITY
 MATCHES WHAT DONALD TRUMPTHIN
 NEITHER AM I.
 IF HE DOES IT, THE BETTER
 EXPLANATION IS IT EXONERATES ME
 IF I DO THIS RATHER THAN WE'VE
 HAD A LONG RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE
 THE TWO MEN DIDN'T REAL LIKE
 EACH OTHER THAT MUCH.
 ALTHOUGH HID HE DID OWN AN
 APARTMENT IN THE TRUMP TOWER HI,
 DID.
 IN THE ORBIT.
 HE DEFINITELY DID.
 IF HE DOES ISSUE A PARDON AND
 SAY HE DOES IT SOONER THAN LATER
 AND IT IS INTERESTING THE WHITE
 HOUSE REFUSES TO RULE IT OUT,
 POLITICALLY SPEAKING DOES THAT
 HARM HIM WITH ANY VOTERS -DO
 ANY OF HIS VOTERS CARE?
 AND DO YOU CARE IF HIS VOTERS
 CARE?
 BUT THE IMPORTANT THING HERE
 IS IT' A WAY FOR HIM SAY THAT
 ANY ANCILLARY CRIME COMING OUT
 OF THE MUELLER PROBE PROVE IT'S
 A WITCH HUNT BECAUSE YOU CAME
 FO AND SAID YOU GOT HIM.
 IT'S A POLITICAL ACT ON HIS PART
 TO SAY THAT -AND FORGET THE
 LAW HERE -WHICH SAYS YES IN
 FACT YOU CAN PROSECUTE THOSE
 CRIMES.
 HE IS SAYING LOOK, THEY WENT TO
 GET ME AND ALL THEY FOUND WAS
 TAX EVASION.
 AND THAT'S A WAY TO TELL
 SUPPORTERS IT WAS A WITCH HUNT.
 BUT DOES IT TELL
 NONSUPPORTERS, THOSE FRINGE
 SUPPORTERS THAT THE PRESIDENT OF
 THE UNITED STATES, THIS
 PRESIDENT DOESN'T BELIEVE IN THE
 RULE OF LAW?
 AND DOES THAT NEGATIVE REALLY
 AFFECT HIM IN THE 2020 ELECTION,
 OR IS THIS ALL SO SECONDARY TO
 ALL OF THE OTHER ISSUES THAT ARE
 OUT THERE?
 YOU KNOW, I KNOW THAT VOTER,
 ME.
 TELL ME ABOUT IT, THEN.
 WELL, THAT'SCT IT.
 THIS SEEMS TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON
 A VERY SMALL HANDFUL OF PEOPLE.
 MAYBE BILL KRISTOL, A FEW OTHER
 OTHERS OF MY CAMP THAT I COULD
 MENTION.
 IT'S A VERY SMALL DEMOGRAPHIC
 SEGMENT, LET'S FACE IT, THOSE
 WHO REALLY CARE.
 THE FACT IS THAT PAUL MANAFORT
 COULD BECOME AN AGENT OF
 INFLUENCE OR A VICTIM OF
 BLACKMAIL.
 BUT YOU ALREADY WERE NOT
 GOING TO VOTE FOR THE PRESIDENT.
 THAT'S EXACTLY IT.
 DOES IT INCLUDE ANYONE ELSE?
 I DON'T KNOW IF IT INCLUDES
 ANYONE ELSE.
 LOOK, IT INCLUDES A VERY SMALL
 SEGMENT OF PEOPLE, BUT I DON'T
 THINK A PARDON FOR MAFT IS
 IN ANY WAY A DECISIVE FACTOR.
 THOSE ARE THOSE VOTERS WHO VOTED
 FOR HIM RELUCTANTLY AND ARE
 SAYING I'M JUST SO DISGUSTED BY
 THE CONSTANT SORT OF VOLCANO OF
 SCANDAL AND LEGALISTIC EVASION
 AND A KIND OF SENSE OF
 IMMORALITY AND CORRUPTION IN THE
 WHITE HOUSE.
 ERIC SWALWELL WAS JUST ON A
 MOMENT AGO, AND HE WAS TRYING TO
 JUSTIFY AND EXPLAIN NANCY
 PELOSI'S DECISION TO COME OUT,
 WITH HER FEELINGS ON
 IMPEACHMENT.
 HE ALSO -IT'S NOT RULING OUT
 RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.
 IF H DOES RUN FOR PRESIDENT,
 DOES HE HAVE TO EXCUSE HIMSELF
 FROM THE INVESTIGATION?
 CAN YOU RUN FOR PRESIDENT
 AGAINST THE MAN YOU ARE
 INVESTIGATING?
 I THINK SO.
 I MEAN EVERYBODY RUNNING FOR
 PRESIDENT IS INVESTIGATING THE
 PRESIDENT.
 IT'S HALF THE SENATE IT SEEMS
 LIKE.
 LOOK, HE IS WELCOME TO GO JOIN
 THE VAST TRUE -I THINK THE
 ENTIRE PARTY IS RUNNING FOR
 PRESIDENT WHICH IS A SIGN OF HOW
 WEAK THEY THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP.
 BUT YEAH, OF COURSE THEY CAN.
 HE PRESIDENT TRUMP AS
 VULNERABLE IN 2020.
 NO.
 AS THE DEMOCRATS THINK HE IS?
 NO
 I THINK THAT'S A HUGE MISTAKE
 FOR DEMOCRATS TO IMAGINE THAT.
 IT'S JUST TWO NUMBERS.

 THAT'S THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, AS
 LOW AS IT'S BEEN NEARLY SINCE

 3.4% THAT WAS WAGE GROWTH LAST
 YEAR.
 AND IN MOST PRESIDENCIES, THOSE
 NUMBERS WILL GET YOU RE-ELECTED.
 IT'S JUST THAT WE HAVE AN
 EXTRAORDINARY PRESIDENCY WITH AN
 INCREDIBLY CORRUPT NARCISSIST
 PRESIDENT.
 BUT DEMOCRATS SHOULD NOTEPEAT
 THE MISTAKE OF THINKING THEY'RE
 GOING ROLL THIS GUY.
 THAT WAS NOT OUR PERCEPTION IN

 MAYBE THERE WAS SOMEBODY WALNG
 AROUND FEELING OVERCONFIDENT.
 I WAS NOT ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE
 BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT ELECTED A
 WOMAN PRESIDENT BEFORE IN THE
 HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES.
 SO I DON'T THINK THAT DEMOCRATS
 ARE WALKING INTO 2020 FEELING
 LIKE WE GOT THIS IN THE BAG.
 I THINK THERE WERE CERTAINLY
 PEOPLE THAT STAYED HOME BECAUSE
 THEY THOUGHT HILLARY HAD IT IN
 THE BAG.
 BUT I DON'T THINK THE DEMOCRATIC
 PARTY OR ANYBODY WORKING ON
 THESE CAMPAIGNS IS WAKING UP
 EVERY DAY THINKING OH, WE HAVE
 THIS EASY BECAUSE DOND TRUMP'S
 APPROVAL RATING --
 EVERY DEMOCRAT CAMPAIGN COMS
 DIRECTOR I HAVE SPOKEN WITH SAID
 THEY BELIEVE DONALD TRUMP IS
 VULNERABLE.
 THEY BELIEVE HE ISBEATABLE, BUT
 THEY ARE ALL, AND EVERY ONE OF
 THEM ISSUES A CAVEAT BUT I HAVE
 NO IDEA OF WHAT'S GOING TO
 HAPPEN BECAUSE OF 2016.
 ZERLINA, BRETT AND NICK, SORRY.
 YOU WANT TO TALK SO BADLY.
 WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
