I'm taking my antidepressant like we discussed. But, I'm still feeling depressed. Is it just me? It's not just you. 2 out of 3 people on antidepressants may still experience symptoms. When added to an antidepressant,... REXULTI has been proven to help reduce symptoms of depression. So I can stay on my current antidepressant... and help build on the progress I've made. <i> REXULTI is not for everyone.</i> <i> Call your doctor about unusual</i> <i> changes in behavior,</i> <i> worsening depression,</i> <i> or thoughts of suicide.</i> <i>Antidepressants can increase</i> <i>these in those 24 and younger.</i> <i> Elderly dementia patients</i> <i> taking REXULTI</i> <i> have an increased risk</i> <i> of death or stroke.</i> <i> Call your doctor if you</i> <i> have high fever,</i> <i>stiff muscles, and confusion</i> <i> to address a possible</i> <i> life-threatening condition...</i> <i> or if you have uncontrollable</i> <i> muscle movements,</i> <i> as these may be permanent.</i> <i> REXULTI has been shown</i> <i> to increase blood sugar</i> <i> in some people.</i> <i> Other risks are increased</i> <i> cholesterol; weight gain;</i> <i> unusual urges or</i> <i> compulsive behaviors; ...</i> <i> decreased white blood cells,</i> <i> which can be serious; ...</i> <i>dizziness on standing; seizures;</i> <i> trouble swallowing;</i> <i> and impaired judgment</i> <i> or motor skills.</i> Now, I'm glad I talked with my doctor about adding REXULTI. <i> Feel better about</i> <i> facing the world.</i> <i> Pay $0 for your first</i> <i> REXULTI prescription.</i> <i> Details at REXULTI.com.</i> <i> Pay $0 for your first</i> <i> REXULTI prescription.</i> I was on the fence about changing from a manual to an electric toothbrush. But my hygienist said going electric could lead to way cleaner teeth. She said, get the one inspired by dentists, with a round brush head. <i> Go Pro with Oral-B. Oral-B's</i> <i> gentle rounded brush head</i> <i> removes more plaque along the</i> <i> gum line.</i> <i>For cleaner teeth and healthier</i> <i>gums.</i> <i> And unlike Sonicare, Oral-B </i> <i>is the first electric toothbrush</i> <i>brand</i> <i> accepted by the ADA</i> <i> for its effectiveness and</i> <i> safety.</i> What an amazing clean! I'll only use an Oral-B! <i> Oral-B.</i> <i> Brush like a pro.</i> [APPLAUSE]
