 LE STRAIGHT OVER TO CNN'S
 NICK VALEN BORDER
 FACILITY IN EL PASO, TEXAS.
 NICK, WHAT'S THE LATEST?
 Reporter: WELL, IT'S A BIT OF
 BREAKING NEWS THIS MORNING.
 WE'RE HEARING FROM ACTING DHS
 SECRETARY ABOUT THOSE SOCIAL
 MEDIA POSTS.
 REMEMBER EARLIER THIS WEEK,
 KATE, WE REPORTED ABOUT THIS
 CLOSED FACEBOOK GROUP THAT
 FEATURED CURRENT AND FORMER,
 THEY SAY, BORDER PATROL AGENTS
 MAKING LEWD COMMENTS, DEROGATORY
 COMMENTS, RACIALLY INFLAMMATORY
 COMMENTS, JOKING ABOUT DEAD
 MIGRANTS.
 NOW THE ACTING DHS SECRETARY
 TWEETING THIS, THIS MORNING.
 I HAVE DIRECTED AN IMMEDIATE
 INVESTIGATION AND AS THE U.S.
 BORDER PATROL CHIEF HAS MADE
 CLEAR, ANY EMPLOYEE FOUND TO
 HAVE COMPROMISED THE PUBLIC'S
 TRUST WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.
 WHAT'S UNCLEAR AT THIS MOMENT,
 WE WERE UNDER THE UNDERSTANDING
 THAT EARLIER THIS WEEK AN
 INVESTIGATION HAD ALREADY BEEN
 UNDER WAY.
 THE POSTS WERE SAID TO HAVE BEEN
 TURNED OVER TO INTERNAL AFFAIRS
 AT CBP.
 THE DHS INSPECTOR GENERAL IS
 ALSO SAID TO HAVE GOTTEN THEIR
 HANDS ON THESE SOCIAL MEDIA
 POSTS.
 A BROADER QUESTION, WE'RE ALSO
 WONDERING IF HE'S CALLING FOR AN
 INVESTIGATION INTO THESE SOCIAL
 MEDIA POSTS.
 WHEN WILL HE CALL FOR AN
 INVESTIGATION INTO THE
 CONDITIONS IN THESE BORDER
 PATROL FACILITIES?
 SPEAKING ON THAT, IT WAS
 YESTERDAY THAT I SPOKE TO A
 LONGTIME VETERAN EL PASO BORDER
 PATROL AGENT WHO SAID THEY'RE
 TIRED OF SEEING THE CONDITIONS
 MIGRANTS ARE BEING HELD IN AND
 DECIDED TO SPEAK OUT, SO LONG AS
 WE CONCEALED THEIR IDENTITY.
 YOU'RE TAKING A BIG RISK BY
 DOING THIS.
 YES, BUT AMERICA NEEDS TO
 KNOW.
 THEY NEED TO KNOW THE TRUTH.
 Reporter: A BORDER PATROL
 AGENT WHO'S HAD ENOUGH.
 IN A CNN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW,
 THE VETERAN AGENT WHO AGREED TO
 GO ON CAMERA ONLY IF THEIR
 IDENTITY WAS CONCEALED,
  GROUP REPORTEDLY ATB> CLOSED
 COMPRISED OF THOUSANDS OF
 CURRENT AND FORMER AGENTS.
 PRO PUBLICA, THE FIRST TO EXPOSE
 THE GROUP, WHERE MEMBERS SHARED
 LEWD AND SEXIST CONTENT ABOUT
 LATINA MEMBERS OF CONGRESS,
 INCLUDING ALEXANDRIA
 OCASIO-CORTEZ.
 THE AGENT TELLING CNN, BEING
 DEROGATORY IS PART OF THE BORDER
 PATROL CULTURE, EVEN HEARING A
 SUPERVISOR JOKE ABOUT DEAD
 MIGRANTS.
 HE WAS MAKING FUN OF THEM.
 SAYING WHAT?
 THAT WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT
 MAKE
 M
 MAKE, IT'S JUST ANOTHER LIFE?
 HE MADE A COMMENT ALSO REGARDING
 RUNNING OVER ILLEGALS.
 I'M LIKE, YOU CANNOT RUN OVER
 PEOPLE.
 Reporter: IN DESCRIBING THE
 CONDITIONS INSIDE THE EL PASO
 DETENTION FACILITIES, THE AGENT
 COMPARED THEM TO A ZOO.
 THE HOLDING FACILITY, THE
 CELLS, THEY ARE, WHAT I WILL
 SAY, FILTHY.
 WE HAVE A MAINTENANCE AND
 CLEANING CREW THAT CLEAN THE
 GENERAL AREA, LIKE THE HALLWAYS,
 BUT I HAVE NEVER SEEN THEM
 CLEANING COUNTERS OR CLEANING
 TOILETS IN THE CELLS OR CLEANING
 SINKS IN THE CELL.
 SOMETIMES YOU GO IN A CELL, AND
 THERE'S TRASH EVERYWHERE.
 THERE AREHOSE IN LEADERSHIP
 OF CUSTOMS AND BORDER
 PROTECTION, THEY SAY THAT
 MIGRANTS ARE GETTING BASIC HUMAN
 RIGHTS.
 WHAT DO YOU SAY TO LEADERS WHO
 SAY THAT?
 Reporter: WHAT IS BASIC HUMAN
 RIGHTS, TOILET PAPER?
 WATER FROM THE SINK?
 OR IN THE SAME CLOTHING FOR
 DAYS.
 I REMEMBER WHEN THERE USED T
 A■hCESSING CENTER.
 ESPECIALLY IN WINTER, WE USED TO
 HAVE THESE BLANKETS.
 TEN DIFFERENT ALIENS WOULD USE
 THE SAME BLANKET.
 WE WOULD RECYCLE THEM.
 WE'LL PUT THEM IN A BAG AND THEY
 WOULDN'T GET WASHED.
 I FEEL LIKE, YOU KNOW,
 MULTIPLE TIMES DURING OUR
 INTERVIEW, YOU'VE SORT OF STARED
 OFF IN THE DISTANCE AND THOUGHT
 ABOUT SOME THINGS YOU'VE SEEN.
 IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THERE ARE
 THINGS THAT YOU MIGHT TAKE HOME
 WITH YOU.
 EVERY DAY.
 LIKE WHAT?
 THE KIDS.
 WHAT ABOUT THE KIDS?
