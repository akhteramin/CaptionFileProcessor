 BECAUSE, LIKE YOU SAY, BRANDING FOR NIKE IS SECOND NATURE.
 THEY HAVE ALMOST DEFINED THE
 BRAND FOR US.
 YEAH.
 WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THAT SWOOSH
 WAS.
 WITH THE MARKETING, YEAH.
 AND SIGNING KAEPERNICK, YOU
 KNOW, IN THOSE MOMENTS IN WHICH
 THERE WAS A LOT OF CRITICISM
 WHICH WILL THEY KNEW THEY WERE
 GOING TO GET, THE BURNING OF THE
 SHOES AND THE REST OF IT.
 IN THE IMMEDIATE MOMENTS AFTER
 THAT, THEY DID ACTUALLY SEE THE
 STOCK PRICES GO UP AND THE SHOE
 SALES GO UP.
 IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT
 HAPPENS NOW AND THE REACTION TO
 THIS CONTROVERSY WAS THE RIGHT
 STEP. STEPHANIE GOSK, THANK YOU.
 CONNECT WITH THE SHOW AT "VELSHI
 & RUHLE."
 KASIE HUNT PICKS UP THE COVERAGE
 RIGHT NOW.
 HELLO, FRIEND.
 HELLO TO YOU, ALI.
 I'M KASIE HUNT.
 THE PRESIDENT'S OWN DEPARTMENT
 OF HOMELAND SECURITY HAS ISSUED
 A SCATHING REPORT ON THE SQUALID
 CONDITIONS FOUND IN A NUMBER OF
 MIGRANT DETENTION CENTERS ALONG
 THE BORDER.
 THE REPORT FROM THE DHS' OFFICE
 OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL
 DESCRIBES DANGEROUS LEVELS OF
 OVERCROWDING FOR LONG PERIODS OF
 TIME.
 IN ONE FACILITY, SOME ADULTS
 WERE KEPT IN STANDING ROOM ONLY
 CONDITIONS FOR A WEEK.
 WHILE IN ANOTHER, MANY MIGRANTS
 SPENT MORE THAN A MONTH IN SMALL
 CELLS PACKED DANGEROUSLY OVER
 CAPACITY.
 MOST OF THE ADULTS HAVE NOT HAD
 A SHOWER DESPITE SOME OF THEM
 BEING HELD AS LONG AS A MONTH.
 SOME FACILITIES PROVIDED WET
 WIPES TO MAINTAIN HYGIENE.
 ONE MAN BLOCKED IN A CROWDED
 CELL HELD UP A CRUDELY MADE SIGN
 FOR INSPECTORS BEGGING FOR HELP.
 MEANWHILE, MANY CHILDREN WERE
 HELD WITHOUT CARE FOR BASIC
 STANDARDS OF LIVING INCLUDING
 ACCESS TO SHOWERS AND CLEAN
 CLOTHES.
 AT TWO OF THE FIVE FACILITIES
 VISITED BY THE INSPECTOR GENERAL
 CHILDREN WERE NOT GIVE HOT MEALS
 UNTILSPECTORS ARRIVED.
 BUT ACCORDING TO THE PRESIDENT
 AND HIS ALLIES THERE'S NOTHING
 HERE.
 KEVIN McALEENAN WHO DEFENDS THE
 CONDITIONS AT ONE NOTORIOUS
 CENTER LAST WEEK.
 UNSUBSTANTIATED CONDITIONS
 LAST WEEK AT A STATE FACILITY IN
 TEXAS CREATED A SENSATION.
 THAT'S BALANCD SOMEWHAT SINCE
 SEVERAL MEDIA OUTLETS VISITED
 AND SAW A CLEAN FACILITY.
 MUCH OF THE COVERAGE IS TOO LATE
 AND IS MISSING THE STORY.
 SO, OUR BIG QUESTION TODAY IS
 WILL THE WHITE HOUSE ACCEPT
 ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ITS
 IMMIGRATION POLICIES?
 JOINING ME NOW NBC NEWS
 CORRESPONDENT JACOB SOBOROFF.
 FORMER CORRESPONDENT CARLOS
 CARVALHO AND BARBARA BOXER WHO
 HOSTS THE BOXER PODCAST.
 JACOB, LET ME START WITH YOU.
 THE REPORT FROM THE OIG.
 I'M GOING TO READ FROM IT.
 SENIOR MANAGERS AT SEVERAL
 FACILITIES RAISED SECURITY
 CONCERNS FOR THEIR AGENTS AND
 DETAINEES.
 FOR EXAMPLE, ONE CALLED THE
 SITUATION A TICKING TIME BOMB.
 IT REALLY UNDERSCORES THE FACT
 THAT THEY SEEM TO HAVE
 UNDERSTOOD JUST HOW BAD THINGS
 HAD GOTTEN.
 AND JUST HOW MUCH OF A PROBLEM
 THIS WAS GOING TO BE.
 AND YET, NOTHING SEEMS TO BE
 DONE.
 YEAH, YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE
 HEAD, KASIE.
 AND I THINK THE TICKING TIME
 BOMB VERY CLEARLY REFERENCES AND
 IS AN ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF
 THE SEVEN FACILITIES IN THE RIO
 GRANDE VALLEY.
 BUT NOT ONLY THERE, IT CAN BE
 APPLIED TO THE FACILITIES THAT
 JULIA AINSLEY AND I REPORTED ON
 EARLIER THIS WEEK IN THE EL PASO
 SECTOR.
 AND FRANKLY THAT PHRASE, A
 TICKING TIME BOMB, CAN BE
 ASCRIBED TO THE BORDER PATROL
 SYSTEM THAT'S BEEN IN THIS
 COUNTRY FOR DECADES.
 IT'S NEVER BEEN WORSE THAN IT IS
 RIGHT NOW IN THE TRUMP
 ADMINISTRATION SEEING MORE
 FAMILIES COMING HERE,
 PARTICULARLY BECAUSE OF THE
 METERING POLICIES THAT ARE
 FORCING PEOPLE TO CROSS ILLEGAL
 WITH, BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO
 WAIT IN ONE OF THE MOST
 DANGEROUS COUNTRIES IN THE
 WORLD, MEXICO.
 BUT FOR YEARS, WE HAVE KNOWN
 THOSE DETENTION FACILITIES ARE
 DESIGNED FOR SINGLE ADULT MEN.
 AND AS YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT HAVE
 COME TO CLAIM UNACCOMPANIED
 MINORS.
 WITH FAMILIES IN THE TRUMP
 ADMINISTRATION, THOSE FACILITIES
 ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR THE PEOPLE
 THAT ARE WE'RE SEEING CROSS OUR
 BORDER LARGELY ASYLUM SEEKERS.
 SO YOU COULD CALL THEM A TICKING
 TIME BOMB OVER THE COURSE OF THE
 LAST YEAR.
 FRANKLY, THEY'VE BEEN A TICKING
 TIME BOMB FOR DECADES, KASIE.
 JACOB, THE WHITE HOUSE MUST
 HAVE HAD AN ADVANCED NOTICE OF
 THIS REPORT, NO?
 I DON'T KNOW IF THE WHITE
 HOUSE HAD KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT WAS
 GOING ON AT THESE FACILITIES AND
 WHAT THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR
 GENERAL AND DEPARTMENT OF
 HOMELAND SECURITY WAS FINDING
 BUT THEY CERTAINLY HAD
 CONVERSATIONS WITH MEMBERS OF
 THE HOMELAND SECURITY THEY'VE
 KNOWN AND I'M SURE THE PRESIDENT
 IS GETTING REPORTS WHO IS
 CROSSING THE BORDERS.
 WHERE THESE FOLKS HAVE BEEN
 DETAINED ULTIMATELY WHERE THEY
 WANT TO GO AND WHY THEY COME TO
 THIS COUNTRY.
 IDEA THAT MAYBE THIS IS A
 SURPRISE TO THE WHITE HOUSE, YOU
 KNOW, DOESN'T SQUARE WITH THE
 INFORMATION THAT'S AVAILABLE TO
 THEM FROM THEIR OWN DEPARTMENT
 OF HOMELAND SECURITY.
 I KNOW THEY'RE PLUGGED IN DAILY
 ON WHAT'S GOING ON AT THE
 BORDER.
 CONGRESSWOMAN CARVALHO, YOU
 TRIED TO VISIT A DETENTION
 FACILITY AND WERE DENIED ACCESS
 WHEN YOU WERE A MEMBER OF
 CONGRESS.
 AND YOU ARE A REPUBLICAN, ALBEIT
 ONE WHO HAS ADVOCATED AT TIMES
 FOR AN IMMIGRATION POLICY THAT
 IS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THIS
 ADMINISTRATION HAS, OBVIOUSLY,
 PUSHED.
 WHAT IS YOUR VIEW ON WHAT THE
 ADMINISTRATION NEEDS TO BE DOING
 RIGHT NOW TO HELP THE PEOPLE WHO
 ARE IN THESE DETENTION CENTERS?
 WELL, KASIE, LET ME SAY THIS
 WOULD BE A DIFFICULT SITUATION
 FOR ANY ADMINISTRATION.
 3, 4, 5,000 PEOPLE ARE COMING
 ACROSS THE BORDER.
 THIS IS A NEW KIND OF
 IMMIGRATION.
 NOT LIKE WE USED TO SEE 10, 15
 YEARS AGO.
 THIS IS A DIFFICULT CHALLENGE, I
 THINK WE HAVE TO BE FAIR AND REC
 THIS THAT.
 THE OTHER THING IS THERE'S A
 MAJOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE
 DETENTION FACILITIES NEAR THE
 BORDER AND THOSE IN OTHER PARTS
 OF THE COUNTRY.
 DOWN HERE IN SOUTH FLORIDA,
 THERE ARE A FEW OF THEM
 DEDICATED TO MINORS AND THE
 CONDITIONS ARE A LOT BETTER THAN
 THE IMAGES WE'VE SEEN COMING
 FROM THE BORDER.
 BUT THE FACT REMAINS, THE
 ADMINISTRATION HAS TO DO BETTER.
 AND THAT THEY WOULD JUST BRUSH
 OFF THIS REPORT FROM THE
 DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY
 IS UNACCEPTABLE.
 CONGRESS HAS TO DO MORE TO
 DEDICATE MORE FUNDING TO UPDATE
 THESE FACILITIES TO MAKE SURE
 THEY'RE COMPATIBLE, THE KIND OF
 IMMIGRATION WE'RE SEEING COMING
 INTO OUR COUNTRY.
 AND, OF COURSE, THE LAWS DO HAVE
 TO BE CHANGED BECAUSE
 UNFORTUNATELY, THE WAY OUR LAWS
 ARE DESIGNED, THEY DO INVITE
 PEOPLE TO COME OVER WITH
 CHILDREN SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE
 THE COYOTES ADVERTISE THAT AS A
 MORE ADVANTAGEOUS STRATEGY FOR
 TRYING TO COME TO THE UNITED
 STATES.
 SO, THIS IS A COMPLEX,
 COMPLICATED PROBLEM.
 AND UNFORTUNATELY, I DON'T THINK
 THIS WHITE HOUSE IS TAKING IT AS
 SERIOUSLY AS THEY SHOULD.
 SENATOR BOXER, THERE IS,
 THOUGH, I TAKE THE CONGRESSMAN'S
 POINT.
 BUT THERE'S STILL A LOT OF
 DECISIONS THAT ANY DECISION THAT
 THE ADMINISTRATION MAY MAKE ON
 HOW PEOPLE ARE CROSSING OUR
 BORDERS.
 WHAT COULD THE TRUMP
 ADMINISTRATION BE DOING
 DIFFERENTLY TODAY TO TRY AND
 MAKE THIS BETTER?
 LISTEN, I'M GOING TO TALK IN
 VERY STARK TERMS HERE.
 WHAT WE SEE IS NOT A TICKING
 TIME BOMB.
 THE BOMB HAS GONE OFF FOR SEVEN
 CHILDREN WHO DIED.
 FOR THESE LITTLE BABIES THAT
 HAVE BLUE FINGERS BECAUSE
 THEY'RE FREEZING.
 THESE PARENTS WHO WERE TOLD
 REPORTEDLY, DRINK OUT OF THE
 TOILET BECAUSE THERE'S NO FRESH
 WATER.
 THIS IS NATURE YOU HAVE TO DO
 BETTER TIME.
 THIS IS WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE
 THIS DONE IN OUR NAME TIME.
 AND WE HAVE TO FIX IT.
 IT'S A STAIN ON AMERICA.
 IT'S BEING DONE IN OUR NAME.
 SO, WHAT DO WE DO?
 THE FIRST THING IS, WE BRING
 BACK THE MODEL PROJECT THAT
 BARACK OBAMA HAD IN PLACE THAT
 WORKED VERY WELL AS AN
 ALTERNATIVE TO DETENTION WHERE
 98% OF THE PEOPLE SHOWED UP FOR
 THEIR COURT DATE.
 AND SECONDLY, WE NEED A SURGE OF
 CASEWORKERS.
 BETO O'ROURKE HAS SUGGESTED
 THIS.
 CASEWORKERS FOR THESE VARIOUS
 CASES SO THEY CAN BE FOLLOWED.
 SO THEY FOLLOW THE RULES, AND
 THEY'RE TAKEN CARE OF.
 AND WE KNOW THAT THIS -- YOU
 KNOW, DETERRENCE IS A STRATEGY
 OF TRUMP.
 AND HOW DOES HE THINK HE'S GOING
 TO DETER PEOPLE?
 BY MAKING THEM GO THROUGH AGONY.
 THIS IS NOT AMERICA.
 IT NEEDS TO STOP, PERIOD.
 JACOB SOBOROFF.
 RESPECTIVELY, TO BOTH THE
 SENATOR AND THE CONGRESSMAN,
 BOTH OF YOU SERVED WHEN THESE
 FACILITIES WERE ALREADY IN
 PLACE.
 IN 2014, PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD A
 SURGE OF UNACCOMPANIED MIGRANT
 CHILDREN IN FACILITIES JUST LIKE
 THIS AND WE SAW PICTURES JUST
 LIKE THIS.
 SO, THESE CONDITIONS ARE NOT
 NEW.
 I DO AGREE WITH, SENATOR BOXER,
 PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS MADE THIS
 WORSE THAN EVER BEFORE.
 CONGRESSMAN CURBELO, I HAVE BEEN
 TO THAT HOMESTEAD FACILITY IN
 SOUTH FLORIDA, I WAS JUST THERE
 LAST WEEK.
 WHERE ARE CHILDREN ARE CURRENTLY
 LIVING IN THE CUSTODY OF HHS.
 CERTAINLY, THE FACILITY IS THERE
 BETTER AND THE LICENSED DAY CARE
 WORKERS TO TAKE CARE OF
 CHILDREN.
 BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY WARNING
 TO THIS, THAT THE TICKING TIME
 BOMB IS JUST LIMITED TO THIS
 TIME PERIOD NOW, I DON'T THINK
 IS FAIR.
 I THINK THE IMMIGRATION
 DETENTION SYSTEM HAS BEEN PLACED
 ON DETERRENCE IN THE CLINTON
 ADMINISTRATION.
 THERE WAS A DOCUMENT PUT OUT
 PREFERENCE THROUGH DETEARENCE.
 THEY'VE KNOWN FROM THE BUSH
 ADMINISTRATION INTO THE OBAMA
 ADMINISTRATION AND NOW WITH THE
 TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WORSE THAN
 EVER BEFORE WAS ALWAYS FORCING
 PEOPLE TO TAKE MORE DANGER
 OPTION AND DEADLY ROUTES INTO
 THIS COUNTRY.
 AND THE CONDITIONS THEY WERE
 HOUSED IN, ONCE IN DETENTION,
 WERE NEVER MEANT FOR PEOPLE TO
 STAY OVER 72 HOURS.
 WE HAVE SEEN STUFF LIKE THIS
 BEFORE.
 IT'S JUST NOT AS BAD AS IT IS
 TODAY.
 SENATOR --
 CAN I MENTION --
 YEAH, YEAH.
 THE REALITY HERE IS THE OBAMA
 ADMINISTRATION VIEW ON
 IMMIGRATION HAS BEEN CRITICIZED.
 YOUR RESPONSE.
 IT'S ALL FINE.
 IT'S ALL FINE.
 THE BOTTOM LINE IS, WE CAN LOOK
 BACK TO THOSE DAYS WHERE THERE
 WERE THESE ISSUES BUT I WOULD
 ARGUE THERE'S NOTHING, NOTHING
 TO THIS EXTENT.
 THIS IS DETERRENCE BY AGONY.
 THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE.
 IT'S JUST UNREAL.
 AND I VOTED FOR COMPREHENSIVE
 IMMIGRATION REFORM.
 HAD PAUL RYAN ALLOWED THAT TO GO
 TO VOTE WE WOULDN'T HAVE ANY OF
 THIS NOW.
 WE CAN ARGUE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
 IN 2014.
 I'M UP FOR THAT, I'M NOT
 ABSOLVING ANYBODY.
 WHAT I'M SAYING IS, THIS IS
 HAPPENING NOW.
 LET'S FIX IT NOW.
 RIGHT.
 LET'S SURGE THE JUDGES, LET'S
 SURGE THE CASEWORKERS.
 LET'S GO BACK TO OBAMA'S PLAN
 WHICH WAS AN ALTERNATIVE TO
 DETENTION THAT JAKE CAN'T
 MENTION THAT WAS WORKING REALLY
 WELL.
 LET'S TRY IT.
 I DON'T CARE -- I'M NOT SAYING
 EVERYONE HAS BEEN WONDERFUL ON
 THIS.
 I'M NOT SAYING I'VE BEEN
 WONDERFUL ON THIS.
 IT'S HAPPENING NOW.
 AND I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING, I
 WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THERE'S
 SOME KIND OF COMPLAINT TO THE
 WORLD COURT ABOUT THIS, THAT
 THERE ARE CRIMES AGAINST
 HUMANITY GOING ON IN OUR NAME.
 IN OUR NAME.
 CONGRESSMAN, JUMP IN.
 LET ME JUST SAY BRIEFLY, THE
 ADMINISTRATION DESERVES A LOT OF
 THE CRITICISM IT RECEIVES.
 AND CERTAINLY ON IMMIGRATION.
 I WAS AN OUTSPOKEN CRITIC WHILE
 I WAS IN CONGRESS ON THIS
 ADMINISTRATION.
 I WILL SAY WEE NEED A LITTLE
 SOBRIETY HERE.
 WE NEED TO TAKE NOTE OF THE FACT
 THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY SET OF
 CIRCUMSTANCES.
 I REMEMBER IN 1994, WHEN OVER
 13,000 CUBANS ATTEMPTED TO COME
 ACROSS THE FLORIDA STRAIT.
 THEY SET UP TENT COMPANIES AT

 GUANTANAMO BAY AT GITMO.
 IT'S EXTRAORDINARY.
 THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S
 EXTRAORDINARY FOR THE CONDITIONS
 THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED OUT OF
 THESE FACILITIES TO BE PRESENT,
 THAT WILL HAVE TO CHANGE.
 BUT AGAIN, THIS IS NOT A REGULAR
 TIME WHEN IT COMES TO ILLEGAL
 IMMIGRATION INTO OUR COUNTRY,
 AND WE JUST SIMPLY HAVE TO TAKE
 THAT INTO ACCOUNT IN EVALUATING
 WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE BORDER.
 BUT DON'T YOU THINK,
 CONGRESSMAN -- I DO TAKE YOUR
 POINT THAT THIS IS AN
 EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCE.
 BUT THESE PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING,
 AS THE SENATOR SAID --
 AND THAT'S TOTALLY
 UNACCEPTABLE.
 AND WHAT WE NEED IS FOR CONGRESS
 TO FUND NEW FACILITIES THAT ARE
 COMPATIBLE TO THE TYPE OF
 IMMIGRATION WE'RE GETTING INTO
 OUR COUNTRY.
 IT'S NOT MEN CROSSING THE BORDER
 LOOKING FOR WORK ANYMORE.
 IT'S FAMILIES, IT'S CHILDREN.
 AND THESE FACILITIES AREN'T
 DESIGNED TO HOLD THEM.
 AND WE NEED FACILITIES THAT CAN
 HOLD THESE FAMILIES WHILE THEIR
 CASES ARE BEING ADJUDICATED AND
 PROCESSED.
 CAN I QUICKLY JUMP IN?
 VERY QUICKLY, JACOB.
 WE'VE GOT TO GO TO BREAK.
 WHAT THE CONGRESSMAN IS
 SUGGESTING HERE AND CORRECT ME
 IF I'M WRONG, WHAT THE TRUMP
 ADMINISTRATION IS SUGGESTING AND
 WHAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
 ALSO WANTED TO DO WAS TO TURN
 AROUND UNDOCUMENTED MIGRANT
 CHILDREN FROM CENTRAL AMERICA.
 DEPORT THEM IMMEDIATELY AND/OR
 DETAIN FAMILIES INDEFINITELY.
 INSTEAD OF RELEASING THEM INTO
 THE INTERIOR.
 WHEN YOU SAY WE NEED TO CHANGE
 THE LAWS, I THINK WE NEED TO GO
 DEEPER ON WHAT CHANGING THE LAWS
 ACTUALLY MEANS.
 WELL, JACOB, REAL QUICK, IT
 DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY.
 WE CAN PRIORITIZE CASE WHERE IS
 MINORS ARE INVOLVED SO THEY CAN
 BE PROCESSED IMMEDIATELY, NOT
 THAT THEY'RE HELD MONTHS AND
 MONTHS, BUT MAYBE TWO OR THREE
 WEEKS UNTIL THOSE CASES ARE
 ADJUDICATED.
 CAN I JUST SAY --
 I'M SORRY, SENATOR.
 WE HAVE TO GO.
 IT IS.
 IT IS.
 THIS IS AN EMOTIONAL DEBATE.
 AND THAT IS A POLICY THAT WE'VE
 DISCUSSED ON THE PROGRAM.
 THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.
 STILL TO COME THIS HOUR, NEW
 CONCERNS JUST HOURS BEFORE THE
 FOURTH OF JULY CELEBRATION IN
 WASHINGTON, INCLUDING REPORTS
 THAT ONLY TRUMP SUPPORTERS WILL
 GET A FRONT ROW SEAT TO THE
 PRESIDENT'S SALUTE TO AMERICA.
 PLUS, IOWA, IOWA, IOWA.
 KAMALA HARRIS HEADS TO THE FIRST
 CAUCUS STATE USING THEY ARE
 POST-DEBATE SURGE IN POLLING TO
 CLOSE IN ON JOE BIDEN.
 RIGHT AFTER THIS BREAK, WHY
 THE PRESIDENT'S CAMPAIGN IS
 REPORTEDLY CONCERNED THAT THEY
 MAY NOT HAVE A MAJOR TOOL IN ITS
 POLITICAL ARSENAL COME 2020.

 THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS REPORTEDLY SWEATING BULLETS OVER
 WHAT SOME ARE DESCRIBING AS A
 MELTDOWN AT THE NATIONAL RIFLE
 ASSOCIATION.
 POLITICO REPORTING TODAY, QUOTE,
 THE TURMOIL IS FUELLING FEARS
 THAT THE ORGANIZATION WILL BE
 PROFOUNDLY DIMINISHED HEADING
 INTO THE ELECTION, LEAVING THE
 REPUBLICAN PARTY WITH A GAPING
 HOLE IN ITS POLITICAL MACHINERY.
 THE PRESIDENT CALLED THE NRA A,
 QUOTE, VICTIM OF HARASSMENT IN A
 TWEET THIS WEEK SAYING THAT THE
 GUN RIGHTS GROUP THAT HELPS GET
 INTO THE WHITE HOUSE MIGHT MOVE
 TO TEXAS WHERE THEY ARE LOVED.
 HE SUGGESTED THE NRA CAN GET
 BETTER PROTECTION THERE FROM THE
 NEW YORK STATE INVESTIGATION
 INTO THE GROUP'S TAX EXEMPT
 STATUS.
 BUT THE ATTENTION FROM THE
 PRESIDENT COMES AMID MULTIPLE
 OTHER REPORTS AROUND THE
 FRACTURE AT THE NRA, INCLUDING
 AN UGLY DISPUTE OVER LEADERSHIP
 OF THE ORGANIZATION.
 JOINING ME THE POLITICO REPORTER
 AND MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR BETSY
 WOODRUFF.
 THANK YOU BOTH.
 ALEX, THIS WAS YOUR STORY IN
 POLITICO, JUST HOW CONCERNED THE
 PRESIDENT'S CAMPAIGN WAS ABOUT,
 FRANKLY, SEEMS LIKE A TOTAL
 COLLAPSE AT THE NRA.
 OR THE INABILITY TO LOOK
 OUTWARD.
 WHAT DOES IT MEAN POTENTIALLY
 FOR THE PRESIDENT'S RE-ELECT?
 IT'S HARD TO POINT OUT HOW
 IMPORTANT IT IS FOR THE NRA FOR
 THE TURNOUT APPARATUS TO THE
 ELECTIONS.
 THE NRA HAS OVER 5 MILLION
 MEMBERS AND THE DUES PAYING
 MEMBERS THAT YOU HAVE, FOR THEM,
 THE NRA IS A VERY IMPORTANT --
 IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT
 ORGANIZATION.
 SO THEY CAN REALLY TURN OUT
 VOTERS.
 AND THEY CAN TURN OUT VOTERS FOR
 THE REPUBLICAN SIDE.
 WITHOUT THEM ON THE FIELD THAT
 CAN HAVE BIG IMPLICATIONS FOR
 THE GOP COME 2020.
 BETSY, YOU'VE DONE A LOT OF
 REPORTING ON KIND OF HOW THE
 BOTTOM HAS FALLEN OUT ON THE NRA
 AND HOW THEY HAVE TURNED ON EACH
 OTHER.
 WHAT IS YOUR ASSESSMENT ROOTED
 IN THAT ON HOW EFFECTIVE IT IS
 IN 2020?
 THE BIGGEST QUESTION IS
 MONEY.
 IS THE NRA ABLE TO REPLICATE THE
 MASSIVE EXPENDITURES IT MADE ON
 TRUMP'S RAISE IN 2012016?
 THERE WERE SOME VOICES ACCORDING
 TO MY VOICES WHO SAID THIS TRUMP
 GUY DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THESE
 GOING VERY FAR.
 MAYBE WE SHOULD FOCUS ON
 CONGRESS MAKING SURE THAT THE
 POTENTIAL PRESIDENT CLINTON
 WOULD HAVE MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE
 AND SENATE.
 BUT SEVERAL LEADERSHIP FIGURES
 IN THE NRA INCLUDING PEOPLE I'VE
 SPOKEN TO CHRIS COX ARGUED, NO,
 WE NEED TO GO ALL IN, AND WE
 NEED TO SPEND BIG ON TRUMP.
 CHRIS COX WHO USED TO BE THE TOP
 LOBBYIST AT THE NRA JUST
 OFFICIALLY LEFT THE ASSOCIATION
 WITHIN THE LAST FEW DAYS.
 HOW THAT LEADERSHIP VOID IS
 GOING TO BE FILLED IS REALLY
 IMPORTANT.
 AND, OF COURSE, THE HUGE
 QUESTION IS ARE THE NRA'S
 FINANCIAL PROBLEMS GOING TO
 LIMIT HOW BIG OF A WAR CHEST
 THEY HAD TO SPEND ON TRUMP.
 OLIVER NORTH WHO WAS FORMALLY
 THE PRESIDENT OF NRA DEPOSED AND
 DESCRIBED AS A COUP, WROTE THAT
 THE NRA UPWARDS OF $120 MILLION
 UPWARDS JUST FOR LEGAL EXPENSES.
 IF THEY'RE SPENDING ON LEGAL
 BILLS AT THAT SCALE THAT'S A LOT
 OF MONEY FOR A NONPROFIT.
 AND IT'S MONEY THEY CAN'T SPEND
 IN 2020.
 BETSY, HOW MUCH OF THIS HAS
 TRICKLED DOWN TO WHAT ALEX WAS
 SAYING THAT PEOPLE SHOW UP AND
 DO WHAT THE NRA ASKED THEM TO
 DO?
 ARE THEY STARTING TO GET
 NERVOUS?
 LOOK.
 IT'S HARD TO SEE HOW FAR IT'S
 TRICKLED OUT.
 AND THERE'S A LOT OF SKEPTICISM
 WITH THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA.
 THEY VIEW THE REPORTERS WHO
 COVER THESE ISSUES AS GENERALLY
 HOSTILE TO WHAT THEY CARE ABOUT.
 AS FAR AS AN AUDIENCE, IT'S MORE
 SKEPTICAL.
 AT THE SAME TIME, OF COURSE,
 IT'S FRUSTRATING BOARD MEMBERS.
 ALAN WEST WHO IS A CONSERVATIVE
 FAN FAVORITE IS A MEMBER OF NRA
 BOARD AND HAS CALLED FOR WANE
 LAPIERRE TO BE DEPOSED.
 AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE COMMENTS
 ON THE YOUTUBE GUN PAGES YOU'LL
 SEE A TON OF FRICTION AND TON OF
 CRITICISM PARTICULARLY OF NRA
 CEO WAYNE LAPIERRE.
 ALEX, YOU WRITE THAT THIS
 GOES BEYOND REPUBLICANS.
 CALLING ON THE NRA TO ADDRESS
 IT.
 AND EXPRESSING VIEWS TO TODD
 YOUNG.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO
 PROTECT THEIR SENATE MAJORITY IN

 A LOT OF SENATORS ELECTED IN
 2016 WON WITH THE HELP OF THE
 NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION.
 YOU CAN BET IT'S NOT JUST THE
 TRUMP CAMPAIGN COUNTING ON THE
 NRA TO TURN OUT VOTERS IN
 CRITICAL STATES LIKE MICHIGAN,
 PENNSYLVANIA, WISCONSIN, THOSE
 IMPORTANT RUST BELT STATES.
 IT'S ALSO GOING TO BE SENATORS
 UP FOR RE-ELECTION IN 2020.
 YOU'RE LIKELY TO HEAR A LOT MORE
 FROM THEM IN THE WEEKS TO COME.
 A LOT AT STAKE.
 THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH.
 GREAT TO SEE YOU.
 WITH HER POLLING ON THE
 RISE, CAN KAMALA HARRIS CREATE A
 WINNING COALITION LIKE FORMER
 PRESIDENT OBAMA'S?
     <i> If you have moderate to</i>        <i> severe psoriasis</i>
     <i> or psoriatic arthritis,</i>
          <i> little things</i>
       <i> can be a big deal.</i>
   <i> That's why there's Otezla.</i>
   <i> Otezla is not an injection</i>          <i> or a cream.</i>

 AFTER A STANDOUT DEBATE PERFORMANCE SENATOR KAMALA
 HARRIS WILL CAMPAIGN IN IOWA
 TODAY.
 IT'S A PLACE WHERE SUPPORT FOR
 THE CALIFORNIA CANDIDATE APPEARS
 TO BE SURGING, ACCORDING TO
 SEVERAL POST-DEBATE POLLS.
 A NEW "USA TODAY" SUFFOLK
 UNIVERSITY POLL PUTS HARRIS IN
 SECOND PLACE WITH 17th PERCENT
 IN THE EARLY CAUCUS STATE.
 THE SENATOR'S RISE HAS SOME
 PEOPLE WONDER WHETHER SHE CAN
 FOLLOW IN OBAMA'S FOOT STEPS.
 QUOTE, THE QUESTION TURNS ON THE
 NOTION OF ELECTABILITY.
 AN OBSESSION FOR PRIMARY VOTERS
 ON ITS HEAD THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
 UNCONCEIVABLE JUST A WEEK AGO.
 LIKE OBAMA, HARRIS HAILS FROM
 HER PARTY'S ESTABLISHMENT BUT IT
 IS A RELATIVELY FRESH FACE WITH
 ONLY TWO YEARS IN HER SENATE.
 SHE HAS POSITIONS WHICH CAN MAKE
 THEY ARE APPEALING TO MORE
 LIBERAL YOUNG VOTERS.
 VAUGHN HILLYARD, ALEX SETWALD.
 AND OUR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT
 AND MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR.
 OBVIOUSLY, THE POLLS HAVE BEEN
 GOOD FOR SENATOR HARRIS.
 BUT I'M CURIOUS WHAT YOU'RE
 PICKING UP BEHIND THE SCENES
 WITH THE CAMPAIGN.
 I MEAN, CLEARLY MANY OF HER
 STAFFERS HAVE BEEN PRETTY GIDDY
 ABOUT HER PERFORMANCE.
 AND IT IS STARTING TO SHOW UP IN
 THE NUMBERS.
 BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THEY'VE
 MADE A RISKY STRATEGY BET HERE.
 AND THERE ARE ALSO QUESTIONS IF
 SHE IS GOING TO GO IN IOWA, THIS
 POLL WOULD SUGGEST PERHAPS SHE
 CAN.
 WHAT ARE YOU PICKING UP ON?
 EXACTLY.
 THIS IS A CAMPAIGN THAT LOOKED
 AT THEIR POLLING SITTING AT 6%,
 7%, 8%, EVER SINCE HER LAUNCH
 BACK IN JANUARY.
 AND THE CAMPAIGN ALWAYS LOOKED
 AT THIS AS THE DEBATE BEING AN
 OPPORTUNITY TO INTRODUCE
 HERSELF.
 AS ALEX POINTED OUT IN HIS PIECE
 THERE, SHE'S JUST IN HER THIRD
 YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE
 OUT OF CALIFORNIA.
 THE DEBATE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO
 SPEAK IN FRONT OF 20 MILLION
 PEOPLE AND ESSENTIALLY INTRODUCE
 HERSELF.
 AND WHAT THE CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN
 COMPELLED TO MAKE THE CASE ON
 FROM GOING THROUGH THE LIKES OF
 MICHIGAN DOWN INTO LOUISIANA
 THROUGH THIS PRIMARY PROCESS, IS
 THAT KAMALA HARRIS IS A GENERAL
 ELECTION CANDIDATE.
 BARACK OBAMA FOR ONE SHOULD KNOW
 WON THE IOWA CAUCUS OVER THE
 LIKES OF JOHN EDWARDS AND
 HILLARY CLINTON.
 HE ALSO WON THE STATE OF IOWA
 NOT ONLY OVER JOHN McCAIN, BUT
 JOHN KERRY.
 IN PLACES LIKE IN IOWA, ALSO IN
 MICHIGAN AND DRIVE HIGHER
 TURNOUT IN PLACES LIKE THE
 DETROIT AREA, OR AROUND THE
 PARTS OF MILWAUKEE, ESSENTIALLY,
 WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
 ELECTABILITY, KAMALA HARRIS IS
 YOUR CANDIDATE.
 THAT'S THE CASE SHE'S TRYING TO
 MAKE OVER THE NEXT TWO DAYS IN
 IOWA TO IOWANS.
 ANEESH, WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN ON
 THIS QUESTION OF IOWA.
 YOU KNOW, IT'S TRUE THAT BARACK
 OBAMA WAS, YOU KNOW, AN
 AFRICAN-AMERICAN WHO APPEALED TO
 A LARGELY WHITE ELECTORATE IN
 IOWA AND SET HIM ON THE PATH TO
 THE PRESIDENCY.
 AND THE COALITION WE'RE SEEING
 BEHIND THIS POLLING IS WHITE
 LIBERALS AND INCREASINGLY
 AFRICAN-AMERICANS.
 IS THIS A TRAJECTORY THAT CAN
 HOLD?
 IT'S A TRAJECTORY THAT CAN
 HOLD IF SHE CAN WEATHER THE
 STORM OF AN INTENSE BACKGROUND
 WITH HER STANCE ON ALL SORTS OF
 THINGS AS A PROSECUTOR.
 I'VE TALKED TO SOME DEMOCRATIC
 CONSULTANTS WHO SAY THERE'S
 GOING TO BE A NUMBER OF
 FRONT-RUNNERS GOING FORWARD.
 RIGHT NOW, JOE BIDEN WAS SEEN AS
 THE PERSON LEADING THE PACK.
 KAMALA HARRIS I SHOULD ALSO SAY
 ARE ON THE RISE.
 I THINK WHAT WE'RE GOING TO LOOK
 AT, WHETHER OR NOT AFTER PEOPLE
 LEARN MORE ABOUT SENATOR HARRIS'
 BACKGROUND INCLUDING ALL OF HER
 CRIMINAL JUSTICE ISSUES AND HER
 STANCES ON IMMIGRATION AND
 HEALTH CARE.
 WHERE SHE DIFFERS IN SOME WAYS
 FROM OTHER CANDIDATES.
 THINKING ABOUT SHE WOULD NOT
 ELIMINATE PRIVATE INSURANCE FOR
 GOVERNMENT-RUN INSURANCE.
 I THINK ONCE PEOPLE START
 DIGGING INTO HER, WE'LL HAVE TO
 SEE WHETHER OR NOT SHE CAN HOLD
 THAT COALITION TOGETHER BUT, OF
 COURSE, PEOPLE ARE VERY EXCITED
 ABOUT HER.
 I THINK HER DEBATE PERFORMANCE
 MADE A LOST OF PEOPLE SHE COULD
 GO AFTER DONALD TRUMP.
 SHE COULD BE ON STAGE WITH HIM,
 LOOK HIM IN THE EYE AND GO TOE
 TO TOE WITH HIM.
 ALEX, ONE CRITICAL PIECE,
 OBVIOUSLY, AFRICAN-AMERICAN
 VOTERS.
 THAT HAS BEEN THE MOST
 IMPORTANT, I WOULD SAY, PIECE TO
 JOE BIDEN'S SUPPORT.
 YOU WRITE SUPPORT FOR BIDEN
 AMONG BLACKS, A DEMOCRATIC
 VOTING BLOC -- EXCUSE ME, THIS
 IS A REUTERS POLL, NOT YOUR
 YOURS.
 MY APOLOGIES.
 THEY BACKED TWO OUT OF TEN
 COMPARED TO 4 OUT OF TEN IN THE
 JUNE POLL FOR BIDEN.
 THAT SEEMS TO BE MAKING INROADS,
 WHAT'S GOING TO CEMENT THIS, IF
 ANYTHING?
 IT'S GOING TO UNITE HOPEFULLY
 LIBERALS ON ONE HAND, GIVEN HER
 BACKGROUND.
 THE TWO GROUPS GOING, THE
 LIBERALS AND THE
 AFRICAN-AMERICANS THAT'S A
 PRETTY UNSTOPPABLE COALITION.
 THERE'S BEEN FOUR OR FIVE POLLS
 AFTER THE DEBATE INCLUING
 REUTERS, QUINNIPIAC YESTERDAY
 THAT SHOWS HER CLIMBING AMONG
 AMERICANS AND BIDEN.
 IT HAS BEEN HER BIGGEST SOURCE
 OF STRENGTH.
 IT WAS HILLARY CLINTON'S IN

 I THINK THE FIELD IS TOO BIG TO
 CONSOLIDATE.
 AFRICAN-AMERICANS, OBVIOUSLY,
 CORY BOOKER IS STILL IN THE
 RACE.
 IF SHE CAN SOLIDIFY A BIG CHUNK
 OF THEM, THAT WILL SOLIDIFY THE
 BASE IN THE LONG RUN.
 SHE'S A WOMAN AND WOMEN DID VERY
 WELL IN 2018.
 DEMOCRATS ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT
 VOTING FOR A WOMAN RIGHT NOW.
 THE QUESTION IS SHE TOO LITTLE
 FOR EVERYONE AND FALLEN TO THE
 MIDDLE WHERE SHE HAS BEEN AHEAD
 IN THE DEBATE.
 OR CAN SHE NOW USE THE STRENGTH
 OF THE DEBATE STAGE TO MOVE
 FORWARD?
 LET ME TAKE THAT LAST VOTE
 WITH WOMEN VOTERS AHEAD.
 LISA WARE AT THE "THE NEW YORK
 TIMES" WROTE TODAY THINKING THAT
 A WOMAN IS NOT THE RIGHT NOMINEE
 IN 2016 -- OR IN 2020, BECAUSE A
 WOMAN LOST TO DONALD TRUMP IN

 AND THERE WAS A SOUTH CAROLINA
 VOTER QUOTED IN HER STORY WHO
 SUPPORTS HARRIS.
 BUT THIS WOMAN WHO SAYS SHE IS
 AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN SAYS,
 QUOTE, I DON'T THINK SHE CAN
 WIN.
 I'M SORRY TO HAVE TO SAY THAT,
 SHE IS A WOMAN AND SHE IS BLACK.
 AS A BLACK WOMAN MYSELF AS MUCH
 AS WE WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE THIS
 IS THIS HUGE SHIFT IN THIS
 COUNTRY, WE HAVE SEEN THE PEOPLE
 HAVE TO FIGHT BACK.
 HOW MUCH THIS RADAR CONTRIBUTED
 TO HARRIS' STRUGGLE TO RISE.
 SHE'S BROKEN OUT SINCE BUT SHE
 WAS FLOATING BACK THERE FOR A
 WHILE.
 IS THIS WHY?
 THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM.
 ELECTABILITY IS THE NUMBER ONE
 THING DEMOCRATS SAY THEY CARE
 ABOUT.
 THE VERY FIRST VOTER JANUARY 6th
 SAID I LOVE ELIZABETH WARREN BUT
 I DON'T THINK THE COUNTRY IS
 READY FOR A WOMAN.
 IT WAS A MIDDLE AGED WOMAN WHO
 TOLD ME THIS.
 THE DATA, ON THE OTHER HAND SHOW
 ME THIS IS NOT TRUE THAT WOMEN
 ON THE BALLOT WIN JUST AS MUCH
 AS MEN DO.
 AND THE AUTHORIZATION OF WOMEN
 IN POLITICS IS MORE FOR
 CANDIDATES GETTING ON THE
 BALLOTS, MORE THAN VOTERS
 DISCRIMINATING AGAINST THEM WHEN
 THEY'RE VOTING.
 SO I THINK THE ELECTORATE IS
 STARTING TO REALIZE THAT AND
 COMBAT THE PERCEPTION --
 I ALSO THINK BARACK OBAMA --
 THE DIFFERENCE, OF COURSE,
 BETWEEN WHAT -- THE DATA THAT
 YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AND, YOU
 KNOW, WHAT ACTUALLY IS PLAYING
 OUT ON THE GROUND IS SOMETHING
 THAT WE'VE NEVER HAD IT TESTED
 AT THE PRESIDENTIAL LEVEL.
 TRUE.
 GO AHEAD.
 I'LL ALSO SAY WHEN BARACK
 OBAMA WAS RUNNING, THERE WERE SO
 MANY AFRICAN-AMERICANS THAT TOLD
 ME PERSONALLY I'M NOT SURE THIS
 COUNTRY IS READY FOR IT.
 THEN WHEN HE WON IN IOWA AND THE
 DEBATES AND PEOPLE LISTENED TO
 HIS MESSAGE AND BECAME INSPIRED
 BY HIS CAMPAIGN.
 PEOPLE SAID WE'RE GOING BEHIND
 THIS AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN.
 THE SAME THING WITH IS THAT
 RIGHT HARRIS.
 I THINK HER DEBATE PERFORMANCE,
 MAKING PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT
 COULD BE AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN
 WOMEN.
 AND WHEN WE SAW PROGRESS IT WAS
 AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN PUSHING
 THE BOUNDARIES.
 IT WILL BE ELIZABETH WARREN OR
 TULSI GABBARD, OR OTHER WOMEN TO
 INSPIRE A NATION, IF THEY'RE TO
 BE SUCCESSFUL.
 ALL RIGHT.
 THANK YOU GUYS, ALL, VERY MUCH.
 SO WITH BIDEN IN THE LEAD
 AND HARRIS SURGING IN THESE
 POLLS, WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF
 THE FIELD?
 WE'RE GOING TO CHECK IN WITH
 NBC'S ROAD WARRIORS WHO ARE WITH

 SENATORS WARREN AND SANDERS.

 VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN IS STILL ATOP EVERY POLL OUT THERE.
 AND YES, CAVEAT, IT IS EARLY.
 BUT ACCORDING TO THREE MAJOR
 POLLS OUT SINCE THE DEBATES, A
 FIELD OF FOUR, BIDEN, HARRIS,
 WARREN AND SANDERS SEEM TO BE
 SEPARATING FROM THE PACT.
 AND QUINNIPIAC ASKED
 SPECIFICALLY WHICH CAME OUT AS
 FAVORITES, SENATOR SANDERS
 ELIZABETH WARREN.
 SHAQ, LET ME START WITH YOU,
 SANDERS' SUPPORT HAS BEEN
 SLIPPING IN THESE RECENT
 NATIONAL POLLS.
 YOU KNOW, I'VE SEEN SOME FLASHES
 OF FRUSTRATION FROM SANDERS IN
 THAT, HE FEELS AND WILL TELL
 ANYONE -- HAD TOLD ME IN A
 RECENT INTERVIEW, YOU KNOW, HE'S
 THE REASON WHY WE'RE TALKING
 ABOUT SOME OF THOSE POLICY
 ISSUES, MEDICARE FOR ALL, ET
 CETERA.
 HOW IS THE CAMPAIGN, YOU KNOW,
 TRYING TO GET THEIR FOOTING BACK
 UNDERNEATH THEM?
 YOU HIT THAT POINT, KASIE.
 THERE ARE SO MANY MORE OPTIONS
 FOR VOTERS IN THIS ELECTION WITH
 SO MANY CANDIDATES THERE.
 THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE SENATOR
 SANDERS FOCUSED ON CONTACTING AS
 MANY VOTERS AS HE CAN.
 HE'S IN THE MIDDLE OF A
 THREE-DAY SWING THROUGH THE
 STATE OF IOWA AND WHAT'S
 INTERESTING WHAT HE'S
 HIGHLIGHTING IN THIS TRIP.
 I CAN TELL YOU, HE'S NOT
 HIGHLIGHTING THOSE RECENT POLLS.
 I SPOKE TO HIS CHIEF OF STAFF
 ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.
 FOR EVERY POLL THAT I WAS ABLE
 TO MENTION THAT SANDERS WAS
 DOWN, HE WAS ABLE TO THROW BACK
 POLLS SHOWING SANDERS GAINING
 MOMENTUM OR STANDARDS.
 HE'S FOCUSING ON RETAIL
 POLITICS.
 HE'S HAVING ICE CREAM SOCIALS.
 HE'S GOING TO BE MARCHING IN, I
 THINK, FIVE INDEPENDENCE DAY
 PARADES OVER THE COURSE OF THIS
 TRIP.
 HE'S VYING TO FOCUS ON VOTERS
 AND HIS GROUND GAME.
 HE JUST OPENED UP AN OFFICE IN
 IOWA CITY.
 HE'S GOING TO BE OPENING UP TWO
 MORE ON THE TRIP, TRYING TO
 GALVANIZE SUPPORTERS AND
 BRINGING IN AS MUCH AS HE CAN.
 THAT ORGANIZATION I WILL
 ABSOLUTELY BUY BUT I DO NOT
 RECOGNIZE THE ICE CREAM SOCIAL
 CANDIDATE BERNIE SANDERS
 COMPARED TO THE LARGE RALLY
 VERSION OF HIM OF 2017.
 AND SELFIES.
 ALI, YOU'RE COVERING
 ELIZABETH WARREN.
 SHE SEEMS TO BE HAVING SOMETHING
 OF A MOMENT.
 WHAT'S THE SENSE WHERE HER
 SUPPORT IS COMING FROM?
 IS IT COMING FROM BERNIE
 SUPPORTERS?
 IS IT COMING FROM ELSEWHERE?
 AND HOW DO THEY MAKE SURE THEY
 CONTINUE THAT SLOW AND STEADY
 BUILD?
 Reporter: YOU SAY SLOW AND
 STEADY, THAT'S BEEN THE MANTRA
 HERE.
 THEY'VE HELD TO THE THEORY THAT
 THE POLLS WILL RISE AND FALL BUT
 THE ULTIMATE THING YOU CAN'T GET
 BACK IN A CAMPAIGN IS TIME.
 THAT'S WHY ELIZABETH WARREN WAS
 ONE OF THE EARLIEST PEOPLE IN
 THE RACE TO LAUNCH THEY ARE
 CAMPAIGN.
 SHE'S BEEN GETTING FOLKS OUT ON
 THE GROUND.
 WE HAVEN'T SEEN HER QUARTER TWO
 RATE.
 HER BURN GAME IS SO HIGH BECAUSE
 THEY INVESTED SO HEAVILY IN THE
 GROUND GAME.
 WHERE HE'S GOING TO BE IN RENO
 TONIGHT, SHE'S SEEN THE PAYOFF.
 VOTERS WHO LIKE HER ON POLICY
 RECOGNIZE THERE MIGHT BE A
 POLICY TWIN IN BERNIE SANDERS.
 BUT THEY'RE NOT BUYING HIM AS
 THE MESSENGER NECESSARILY.
 LISTEN TO WHAT ONE VOTER TOLD ME
 LAST NIGHT.
 BERNIE IS NOT ON MY LIST THIS
 TIME AROUND.
 I THINK WE ALL HEARD HIS PLANS
 LAST TIME.
 AND IT DIDN'T GET HIM THE
 NOMINATION.
 I THINK WE'RE READY FOR SOMEONE
 NEW.
 AND WHEN I WATCHED THE DEBATES,
 BERNIE, TO ME, PERSONALLY, HE
 CAME ACROSS AS KIND OF ANGRY AND
 IN YOUR FACE.
 AND THAT'S NOT WHAT WE NEED
 RIGHT NOW.
 I'M DONE WITH IN YOUR FACE.
 Reporter: THIS IS THE REALITY
 OF THE NEW LANDSCAPE FOR BERNIE
 SANDERS.
 LAST TIME AROUND IT WAS HIM
 VERSUS HILLARY CLINTON.
 THIS TIME AROUND, IT'S HIM AND
 HIS IDEAS WITH CENTRAL FOCUS.
 BUT MAYBE A LOT CAN PICK UP
 WHERE BERNIE SANDERS LEFT OFF,
 KASIE.
 INTERESTING COMMENTS FROM
 THAT VOTER THERE.
 GINGER GIBSON, THE SANDERS
 CAMPAIGN INSISTS THEY'RE GOING
 TO TRY TO KEEP THEIR BASE AND
 REACH OUT TO DISILLUSIONED
 VOTERS.
 PERHAPS PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR
 TRUMP TO GET AHEAD IN THE
 CAMPAIGN.
 THE REALITY IS, HE SEEMS TO BE
 BASICALLY IF NOT FALLING, BUT
 RIGHT WHERE HE WAS, AND IN A
 CROWDED PLAN LIKE THIS, THAT'S A
 BAD SPOT TO BE?
 WHERE IS HIS FLOOR, PEOPLE
 HAVE SUGGESTED HE MIGHT ALREADY
 BE THERE.
 THIS IS HE'S STRIDNT SUPPORTERS
 AND HE HASN'T GROWN FROM THERE.
 HE HASN'T APPEARED TO EVOLVE OR
 GROW HIS BASE IN A WAY THAT
 WOULD BRING MORE PEOPLE IN,
 PARTICULARLY WHEN THERE ARE MORE
 PEOPLE ON THE STAGE WITH HIM OF
 WHICH TO CHOOSE FROM.
 THE PARTY HAS CHANGED A LOT IN
 THE LAST FOUR YEARS.
 THE VOTERS HAVE CHANGED A LOT IN
 THE LAST FOUR YEARS.
 LARGELY, BERNIE SANDERS WILL
 TELL YOU, OH, HE'S GOT NEW
 PROPOSALS.
 HE'S CHANGED A LOT.
 REALLY, THE BERNIE SANDERS WE
 SAW ON THAT 2016 STAGE IS THE
 SAME BERNIE SANDERS WE SAW LAST
 WEEK.
 HE'LL TALK ABOUT ECONOMIC
 JUSTICE BUT NOT NECESSARILY
 SOCIAL JUSTICE WHICH IS WHAT A
 LOT OF VOTERS ARE LOOKING FOR.
 THANK YOU GUYS VERY MUCH.
 THE STAGE IS SET AND THE
 TANKS HAVE TAKEN TO THE MALL.
 THE CONCERN OVER THE PRESIDENT'S
 FOURTH OF JULY SALUTE TO AMERICA
 IS ONLY GROWING ACROSS D.C.
 THE REASONS WHY, COMING UP NEXT.
            I switched to MiraLAX             for my constipation.
             <i> Stimulant laxatives</i>            <i> forcefully stimulate</i>
       <i> the nerves in your colon.</i>
              <i> MiraLAX works with</i>               <i> the water in your</i>
            <i> body to unblock your</i>               <i> system naturally.</i>
            <i> And it doesn't cause</i>                       <i> bloating,</i>
 <i>cramping, gas,</i> <i>or sudden urgency.</i>
             <i> MiraLAX.</i>      <i> Look for the pink cap.</i>
      People say if you have     occasional constipation,
 you should know the location of        a decent bathroom.
 My gut says, take NEW Benefiber         Healthy Balance.
      This daily supplement
 helps maintain digestive health            naturally
    while relieving occasional          constipation
    and abdominal discomfort.
  NEW Benefiber Healthy Balance
 TOMORROW IS THE BIG DAY. PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CONTROVERSIAL
 SALUTE TO AMERICA.
 SOME BRADLEY FIGHTING VEHICLES
 SPOTTED HEADING TOWARD THE MALL
 BUT THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY THING
 ON THE MOVE.
 ACCORDING TO "THE WASHINGTON
 POST," THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE
 IS DIVERTING $2.5 MILLION FOR
 RECREATION FEES PRIMARILY
 INTENDED TO IMPROVE PARKS ACROSS
 THE COUNTRY, JUST A FRACTION OF
 THE EXTRA COST THE GOVERNMENT
 FACES AS A RESULT OF THIS EVENT.
 THE PRESIDENT PROMISING A SHOW
 OF A LIFETIME DEFENDED HIS
 PRODUCTION ON TWITTER SAYING,
 QUOTE, THE COST OF OUR GREAT
 SALUTE TO AMERICA WILL BE VERY
 LITTLE COMPARED TO WHAT IT'S
 WORTH, WE HAVE THE TANKS AND THE
 PILOT, THE AIRPORT IS RIGHT NEXT
 DOOR ALL WE NEED IS THE FUEL.
 WE OWN THE TANKS AND ALL.
 FIREWORKS ARE DONATED.
 YOU'RE WATCHING ALL OF THIS
 UNFOLD.
 AND CLEARLY, ONE OF THE BIG
 DIFFERENCES FROM YEARS PAST,
 SUDDENLY, THERE IS A VIP
 SECTION, FOR THE BEST SEATS IN
 THE HOUSE, THAT, YOU KNOW, IT
 USED TO BE, WHOEVER -- THE
 EGALITARIAN RULE OF THE DAY,
 FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED?
 THAT'S RIGHT, KASIE, EXACTLY.
 AS YOU SEE OVER MY SHOULDER,
 THOSE PREPS CONTINUE.
 WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO SHOW YOU
 EXACTLY WHERE PRESIDENT TRUMP IS
 GOING TO SPEAKING FROM TOMORROW
 EVENING.
 AS YOU CAN SEE, THE CUSTOMARY
 BULLETPROOF CLASS THAT SURROUNDS
 THE PRESIDENT AT A LARGE-SCALE
 EVENT.
 THIS IS OPEN AND FREE TO THE
 PUBLIC BUT CERTAINLY THOSE WHO
 HAVE TICKETS FROM THE REPUBLICAN
 NATIONAL COMMITTEE AND EVEN THE
 TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAVE THE BEST
 SEATS IN THE HOUSE.
 THOSE FOLKS HAVE A PRIMARY
 SECTION IN THE FRONT.
 AND THEY'LL ACTUALLY HAVE VERY
 GOOD VIEW OF SOME OF THOSE
 MILITARY VEHICLES.
 YOU MENTIONED.
 THERE IS A BRADLEY FIGHTING
 VEHICLE THAT WAS PARKED ON
 INDEPENDENCE AND MOVED HERE A
 SHORT TIME AGO.
 JUST A SMALL FRACTION OF THE
 MILITARY MIGHT THAT WILL BE ON
 FULL DISPLAY.
 THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT WANTS.
 HE WANTS THESE OPTICS AROUND THE
 WORLD.
 HE WAS INSPIRED IN PARIS BY
 PRESIDENT MACRON AND SAID I
 WOULD LIKE TO DO THIS BACK HOME.
 WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THIS IS
 GOING TO COST.
 THERE ARE A LOT OF ELEMENTS.
 MILITARY FLYOVERS.
 ALL OF THE MILITARY BRANCHES
 REPRESENTED.
 AND THE BIG QUESTION WILL THIS
 TURN MORE CAMPAIGN RALLY THAN A
 TYPICALLY NONPARTISAN EVENT.
 THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN.
 THERE ARE SOUND CHECKS HERE.
 THEY'RE GETTING READY.
 YEAH, SECURITY HAS BEEN TIGHT.
 THERE AREN'T TOURISTS ALLOWED
 INSIDE THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL
 ANYMORE, AND PROBABLY UNTIL THIS
 EVENT IS OVER TOMORROW.
 THIS TAKING CENTER STAGE ON THE
 NATIONAL MALL, KASIE.
 COURTNEY, TO PICK UP ON THAT
 POINT THAT MONICA WAS MAKING AT
 THE RISK OF IT TURNING INTO A
 CAMPAIGN RALLY.
 FIRST OF ALL, HOW UNUSUAL IS IT
 FOR THE UNITED STATES MILITARY
 TO BE INVOLVED IN A PRODUCTION
 LIKE THIS?
 HOW MUCH HISTORICALLY IS THIS
 SOMETHING THEY'RE USED TO DOING?
 AND SECOND OF ALL, WHAT IS THE
 LEVEL OF CONCERN AROUND THE
 POSSIBILITY OF POLITICS TO PLAY
 INTO AN EVENT -- OBVIOUSLY, WE
 KNOW OUR MILITARY LEADERS ARE
 TYPICALLY TO CLEAR THAT.
 SO, OF COURSE, THE MILITARY
 IS NOT ALLOWED TO BE INVOLVED
 OFFICIALLY IN ANY POLITICAL
 EVENT.
 THERE ARE SPECIFIC RULES.

 CANDIDLY IN THE LAST YEAR OR
 TWO, WE'VE SEEN MORE GUIDELINES
 IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS,
 SECRETARY SHANAHAN PUT OUT A
 MEMO REMINDING PEOPLE THAT THE
 MILITARY IS APOLITICAL.
 FOURTH OF JULY IS NOT TYPICALLY
 A MILITARY HOLIDAY WHERE YOU SEE
 MILITARY LEADERS SPREAD
 THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY INVOLVED
 IN THESE KIND OF ACTIVITIES.
 SINCE THE PARADE, THE FIRST OF
 THE PLANNING, WHEN WE FIRST
 HURTS MENTION OF THE PARADE
 THERE HAS BEEN CONCERN FROM
 MILITARY LEADERS HERE AT THE
 PENTAGON THAT THIS COULD BECOME
 A POLITICAL RALLY THAT WOULD BE
 AWKWARD FOR THE MILITARY LEADERS
 THERE AND THE MILITARY INVOLVED.
 DEFENSE OFFICIALS WE'VE SPOKEN
 WITH THIS WEEK THAT THEY'RE
 ASSURED THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP,
 HIS SPEECH IS LESS THAN 20
 MINUTES.
 HE WILL SPEAK ABOUT FOUR MINUTES
 ABOUT EACH SERVICE.
 THERE'S SOME BELIEF THAT HE
 WANTS THE JOINT CHIEFS -- FOR
 THE MOST PART IT WILL BE VICE
 CHIEFS WHO WILL BE HERE.
 THAT HE WANTS EACH INDIVIDUAL
 REPRESENTATIVE AT SOME POINT TO
 COME UP AND STAND WITH THEM WHEN
 THEY'RE REVIEWING THEIR
 AIRCRAFT.
 WHEN HE'S TALKING ABOUT THEM OR
 WHATEVER.
 BUT THERE IS SOME CONCERN THAT
 IN FACT THAT COULD LOOK LIKE A
 POLITICAL STATEMENT OR A
 POLITICAL RALLY.
 BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE
 HERE IS THAT THE PENTAGON
 LAWYERS, THEY WENT THROUGH THIS
 EVENT AS THEY DO WHEN THERE'S
 ANY MILITARY PARTICIPATION IN AN
 EVENT, THEY FOUND THAT IN FACT
 IT IS LEGAL.
 AND THEY ARE ALLOWED TO BOTH
 PARTICIPATE AND ATTEND THIS
 EVENT, KASIE.
 SO, HAS THE PENTAGON REVIEWED
 THE PRESIDENT'S REMARKS?
 DO THEY KNOW WHAT HE'S GOING TO
 SAY TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE
 COMFORTABLE HAVING THEIR GUYS
 STAND UP NEXT TO HIM?
 AT THIS POINT, ALL THEY'VE
 BEEN GIVEN IS THE GUIDANCE THAT
 HE'LL BE SPEAKING ABOUT THE
 VARIOUS SERVICES HERE.
 ASSUMING THE WEATHER HOLDS OUT
 AND THEY HAVE FLYOVERS EACH WILL
 BE REPRESENTED IN THE AIR SHOW.
 THE F-22s, THE F-35s.
 THE BLUE ANGELS IT WILL
 CULMINATE WITH WITH THE NAVY'S
 BLUE ANGELS.
 OF COURSE, THEY PARTICIPATE IN
 AIR SHOWS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY,
 ALL OVER THE WORLD SO THAT WON'T
 BE UNCOMMON.
 WHAT WE DON'T KNOW YET EXACTLY
 WILL THE PRESIDENT STICK TO THE
 SCRIPT HERE OR GO OFF ON A
 POLITICAL TANGENT.
 ALWAYS AN IMPORTANT QUESTION.
 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
 TODAY, THE COUNTRY SAID
 FAREWELL TO A HERO.
 ONE MORE TIME UP NEXT.
 ONE MORE THING BEFORE WE GO. TODAY IN NEW YORK, THE CITY AND
 WORLD SAID GOOD-BYE TO 9/11
 FIRST RESPONDERS LUIS ALVAREZ.
 CHANCES ARE YOU KNOW THE NYPD
 DETECTIVE FROM HIS FINAL DAYS
 SPENT ON CAPITOL HILL, FIGHTING
 FOR LAWMAKERS TO CONTINUE
 FUNDING FOR THE 9/11
 COMPENSATION FUND.
 BUT ALVAREZ BECAME AN AMERICAN
 HERO LONG BEFORE THEN, ATOP THE
 RUBBLE OF GROUND ZERO SPENDING
 MONTHS COMBING FOR SURVIVORS AND
 REMAINS.
 MANY OF HIS FALLEN COMRADES.
 DESPITE HAVING TROUBLE BREATHING
 DETECTIVE ALVAREZ KEPT GOING
 AFTER THE EPA TOLD HIM THE AIR
 WAS FINE BUT IT WASN'T.
 THREE YEARS AGO, ALVAREZ BEGAN
 HIS FIGHT WITH COLON CANCER.
 DESPITE GROWING WEAK AND WEAK,
 HE NEVER STOPPED FIGHTING.
 YOU MADE ME COME DOWN HERE
 THE DAY BEFORE MY 69th ROUND OF
 CHEMO.
 AND I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT
 YOU NEVER FORGET TO TAKE CARE OF
 THE 9/11 RESPONDERS.
 IF I CAN HELP, JUST ONE MORE
 FIRST RESPONDER, THEN IT MAKES
 IT ALL WORTH WHILE FOR ME.
 YOU KNOW, IT SOUNDS LIKE A
 CLICHE, BUT IT'S THE TRUTH.
 SADLY, ALVAREZ NEVER MADE IT
 TO THAT 69th ROUND OF CHEMO.
 INSTEAD GOING INTO HOSPICE,
 SHORTLY AFTER HE RETURNED FROM
 CAPITOL HILL.
 HE PASSED AWAY THIS WEEKEND,
 JOINING MORE THAN 2,000 FIRST
 RESPONDERS TO PASS AWAY FROM
 ILLNESSES RELATED TO THEIR WORK
 AT GROUND ZERO.
 AT TODAY'S CEREMONY, IN THE SAME
 CHURCH HE GREW UP ATTENDING
 AFTER MOVING FROM CUBA AT
 1-YEAR-OLD, HIS PRIEST RELAYED
 THE SINGLE REQUEST THAT LUIS HAD
 FOR THIS FUNERAL THAT WE ALL
 REMEMBER THE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN
 WHO WENT BEFORE HIM AND THOSE
 CONTINUE TO FIGHT NOUN THAT HE'S
 GONE.
 TODAY AS THE 53-YEAR-OLD WAS
 REMEMBERED, THE LAST WORDS HE'S
 KNOWN TO HAVE SAID WERE RECITED.
 QUOTE, AT THE END, THE ONLY
 THING THAT MATTERS IS HOW MUCH
 WE LOVED.
 MAY HE REST IN PEACE.
 THAT WRAPS THINGS UP FOR US THIS
 HOUR.
 I'
