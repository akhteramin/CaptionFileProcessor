 Announcer: It's the 4th of July, and Kelly and Ryan
 are having a party--
 a pool party.
 Today here to splash
 in the pretend water,
 the guys from "Stranger Things."
 And you can't have a celebration
 without music, so O.A.R. is here
 as our holiday house band.
 And the co-hosts are tossing
 bags with the American Cornhole
 champions.
 Plus, members of our
 studio audience could win
 some holiday prizes when they
 compete in our 4th of July Games
 all next on "Live."
 [upbeat music]ive."
 And now here are your
 all-American co-hosts,
 Kelly Ripa and Ryan Seacrest.
 [cheers and applause]

 Ryan: Hey!

 Whoo!
 How's it going?
 Hi.
 Kelly: Hi.

 [cheers and applause]
 Ryan: Happy 4th of July.
 Good morning, everybody.
 [cheers and applause]
 Welcome to our party.
 Kelly: Hey, guess what.
 O.A.R. is our house band today.
 Ryan: Yeah, yeah.
 Kelly: They're gonna be
 performing for us throughout
 the show.
 Thank you.
 Ryan: Kelly, please.
 Kelly: Look at this.
 Ryan: Let's talk about
 the 4th of July, Kelly.
 Kelly: Ryan, I was hoping
 you would bring it up.
 [laughter]
 Ryan: The most important part
 of the 4th, obviously,
 is not necessarily the history
 but posting photographs of your
 celebration on this day, right?
 Kelly: Correct.
 Ryan: So many great
 opportunities.
 Kelly: Correct.
 Ryan: Now--
 Kelly: Sophia,
 you are so cute.
 Sorry, go ahead.
 Ryan: These are the best
 captions for 4th of July
 for your pictures.
 So you're welcome.
 Put these to good use later.
 "Drinkin'--
 #DrinkinLikeLincoln.
 [laughter and cheers]
 I'm not making these up.
 These are actually online.
 Um...
 Red, white, and brew.
 #RedWhiteAndBrew.
 [cheers and applause]
 The Star-Spangled Hammered.
 Kelly: [laughs]
 Ryan: Sippin' on liber-tea.
 Kelly: Yeah, I like that.
 Ryan:, Well, that's--
 if you want--
 Kelly: Mm-hmm.
 You know what?
 Ryan: Tell me, Kel.
 Kelly: It's funny.
 Ryan: Is it?
 Kelly: We're talking about
 where can we keep
 this gigantic flamingo,
 because we can all agree
 this is probably the greatest
 pool float in the universe.
 [cheers and applause]
 Ryan: I think so.
 Kelly: Seaworthy.
 This is like the yacht
 of sea--of pool floats,
 would you not say?
 Ryan: This is it.
 This is what you strive for.
 Kelly: You guys
 are rock stars.
 You have this all day long.
 This is, like, in your tub.
 Ryan: [laughs]
 Kelly: But would you like
 to see the world's largest pool?
 It's at a resort in Chile.
 Ryan: Look at that.
 Oh, my God.
 Kelly: It's the San Alfonso
 del Mar, world's largest
 manmade lagoon.
 It's the exact same
 crystal-clear turquoise hue
 of the sea.
 So they made the pool look
 just like the sea, and they
 filled it with seawater.
 I mean, why not just go
 in the sea, right?
 I mean, am I right,
 or am I just being a killjoy?
 Ryan: A lot of people
 are afraid of, I don't know,
 what they have in the sea.
 They could have jellyfish.
 They could have other animals,
 creatures--
 Kelly: Well, listen.
 Somebody goes over there
 and grabs something over there
 and pulls a prank
 and throws it in the pool,
 it's gonna live, because
 it's seawater, right?
 Ryan: "Honey, I'll be
 right back.
 I'm going to do some laps."
 How long you think
 that would take, days?
 Kelly: I guess.
 I mean, they've got sailboats
 in there!
 But we could definitely get a
 whole flock of these flamingos.
 Ryan: Yeah.
 We could Jet Ski in there,
 if that's legal.
 Kelly: I see all kinds
 of things in there.
 Ryan: By the way, you know,
 there are some people who are
 afraid to swim in the ocean,
 and so that's a good
 alternative.
 On the 4th of July,
 we should tell you--
 I mean, you know this,
 obviously, from history--
 the United States observes
 a federal holiday in honor of
 the Declaration of Independence,
 commemorates the adoption of
 the Declaration of Independence
 July 4, 1776...
 [cheers and applause]
 By delegates from
 the 13 colonies.
 Now--now the important stuff.
 If the 4th of July falls
 on a Sunday, we observe
 the holiday on the following
 Monday.
 If it falls on a Saturday,
 we observe it on a Friday.
 Both: If it falls on a...
 Kelly: On a Tuesday, we take
 the whole rest of the week off.
 Ryan: Exactly.
 If it falls in between...
 [applause]
 Kelly: Hey, did you hear
 about this?
 Ryan: No, but I'm about to.
 Kelly: You guys know--
 how many--let's see.
 I see a lot of young people here
 today.
 Millennials and Gen Zers,
 Ryan: Hey, guys.
 Kelly: Where are you? Yes?
 [cheers and applause]
 Lots.
 Ryan: My people.
 Kelly: Your people are here.
 Your people are representing.
 Ryan: I see you.
 Kelly: So the flamingo pose
 is the latest Instagram-friendly
 stance.
 Do you know about the
 flamingo pose, everybody?
 Here's, I believe--
 is that Kendall Jenner?
 Yeah, Kendall Jenner is...
 well, are they calling it
 the flamingo pose because she's
 wearing that dress
 or because her legs--
 the one leg?
 Ryan: Well, the dress helps.
 Kelly: Gelman, we are--
 you know, we are
 in our thong shorts.
 Gelman: Yes.
 Kelly: So maybe you can do
 the flamingo for us?
 Somehow, that looks different.
 That doesn't look like--
 [laughter]
 Ryan: That was tree
 from yoga.
 Kelly: You stand on one leg,
 and you get bonus points
 if you can slightly cross
 your knees, which helps
 to create a slimming effect
 for your legs.
 Ryan: Let's see
 your bonus points.
 Kelly: Gelman, you've got--
 Gelman: I broke my knee.
 Come on!
 What do you want from me?
 Ryan: The other thing
 that's a trend this summer--
 this is not good for your skin,
 can't highly recommend it--
 but they're saying
 sunburn tattoos.
 You know when you fall asleep
 in the sun and you leave
 your hand like this?
 Kelly: Yeah!
 Ryan: So sunburn tattoos
 are big for the summer of 2019.
 People are placing stencils
 on exposed skin, soaking up
 the sun, and then they've got,
 you know, the Batman logo
 or other different things
 that look like a tattoo.
 Kelly: Oh, that seems
 dangerous, though.
 Ryan: Well, that's not great.
 Kelly: It's not--here's
 the thing, kids,
 and I'm gonna tell you this.
 [clears throat]
 [sighs] Oh, gosh.
 Here's what I'm gonna tell you,
 because nobody told us,
 in my day, this, because
 there was still, like, a lot
 of conflicting data
 about sunscreen,
 at least in our household.
 Ryan: Right.
 Kelly: It's not the sunburn
 that day, right?
 It's what that sunburn
 turns into 30 years from now.
 Right, moms?
 Yeah.
 Ryan: So put it on early so--
 Kelly: And I know
 that it is in your instinct,
 Sophia, to tune out the moms.
 Do you understand?
 I get it.
 I--we get it.
 It's everybody's instinct
 to tune out the moms.
 Ryan: Right.
 Kelly: But we actually--
 and this--we actually,
 when it comes to this thing,
 know exactly what we're
 talking about.
 Ryan: You carry wisdom
 with this.
 Kelly: Yes.
 You don't need--you don't need
 a Batman-shaped melanoma
 30 years from now.
 [laughter and applause]
 Ryan: One other quick
 public service
 for the barbecuers today,
 for July 4th.
 Kelly: Yes?
 Ryan: If you are someone
 that tends--like, when I'm out
 and I'm with other people,
 usually they get
 the mosquito bites.
 Kelly: Am I crowding you?
 I just noticed you leaned away
 from me.
 I feel like--I feel like
 I just brushed my teeth,
 so I don't think it's--
 Ryan: No, no, no,
 you smell like a lozenge.
 Kelly: I do.
 Well, that's because I ate
 the lozenge.
 Ryan: No, but you're not
 crowding me at all.
 Kelly: Right.
 Ryan: I just wanted
 to make eye contact.
 Kelly: Oh, okay.
 So your--
 so your vision is going.
 Ryan: My vision's bad.
 Kelly?
 Kelly: Okay.
 Ryan: Kelly?
 Kelly: You're the first
 Millennial I've ever seen
 do that.
 Ryan: Can I borrow
 my Millennial glasses
 to read this?
 Kelly: Sure, go for it.
 Ryan: Oh, look at this.
 No, it's a public service.
 So usually I'm not the one
 that gets eaten by mosquitoes.
 It's the person I'm with, which
 is a great going-out benefit.
 Kelly: Oh, my gosh.
 Ryan: But if you're the one
 that always gets the mosquito
 bites, researchers say
 music by Skrillex will prevent
 the mosquitoes from biting you.
 Gelman: [laughs]
 Ryan: Researchers examined
 the effects of electronic music
 on mosquitoes, and it made them
 less likely to bite.
 Kelly: Yay, Skrillex.
 Ryan: So Skrillex is the
 soundtrack to your barbecue.
 Today on the show, the cast
 of "Stranger Things,"
 they are here.
 Gaten, Finn, Caleb, Noah--
 they're all here backstage,
 a whole bunch of them.
 Kelly: And nothing says
 4th of July like cornhole,
 so we're gonna play cornhole
 with the top competitors from
 the American Cornhole League.
 By the way...
 [applause]
 I was like, "I thought
 we called it, on our show,
 Live Hole," and they were
 like, "No, it's only Live Hole
 when we throw the beanbags
 into our mouths."
 Gelman: Exactly.
 We've a special game
 that we've developed.
 Kelly: Unbelievable.
 Gelman: This is
 the real game.
 Ryan: This is the real--
 Kelly: This is the real...
 Ryan: This is the league.
 Kelly: Cornhole.
 Ryan: We have the league
 champions, all right.
 And throughout today's show,
 members of our studio audience
 will play "Live's"
 4th of July Games.
 The first game is our annual
 4th of July Trivia
 Dancer Off.
 The dancers
 dressed themselves up.
 They're ready to try and dance
 their way to victory.
 So let's dance!
 [cheers and applause]
 Kelly: First up, say hello
 to Mary Malloy
 from East Rockaway, New York.
 [upbeat music]
 [cheers and applause]
 Ryan: Our next contestant
 is Gary Callioni
 from Cincinnati, Ohio.
 Gare.
 [cheers and applause]

 What's up, my brother?
 Kelly: Nice, Gary.
 Our third contestant is
 Carla Gomen from
 El Dorado Hills, California.
 [cheers and applause]

 Very nice.
 Ryan: And last but not least,
 let's bring out Meredith Miller
 from San Antonio, Texas.
 [cheers and applause]

 Kelly: All right,
 studio audience.
 You have a job.
 Ryan: Oh, yes.
 Kelly: You're going to vote
 for your favorite dancer,
 and after trivia we will
 announce who the audience picked
 to win, okay?
 Ryan: All right, now...
 [cheers and applause]
 Kelly: So uncomf--
 Ryan: These are cool.
 Kelly: Thanks.
 Ryan: I love those.
 Kelly: They're not mine;
 they're Jan's.
 Ryan: Oh, well, Jan,
 those are great.
 Kelly: Thank you.
 Ryan: All week long, we're
 playing a special audience
 edition of Stump the Hosts,
 where an audience member shares
 a summer-themed truth or lie
 and we have to figure out
 which is verdad.
 Kelly: If they stump us,
 they get a Kelly and Ryan mug
 and $1,200 kitchen appliance
 package from Cuisinart...
 [cheers and applause]
 Which we can all agree is
 all of the kitchen appliances.
 Ryan: It is everything.
 So, dancers, give it your all
 right now.
 It's time for Stump the Hosts
 audience edition.

 Ryan: Happy Independence Day.
 Kelly: Good job, you four.
 Amazing.
 Now let's meet today's
 audience participant.
 Where is Holly Dance
 from Ogden, Utah?
 Ryan: Holly Dance?
 Kelly: Hi, Holly!
 [cheers and applause]
 Okay.
 Ryan: Okay.
 Kelly: Okay, you can stay
 right there in the ocean,
 and Ryan and I will stay here
 on this side of the--
 tail end of the flamingo.
 Awesome.
 Ryan: So by the way,
 happy 4th of July.
 Thank you so much!
 Ryan: You look great.
 Thank you.
 Kelly: You look adorable.
 Ryan: What is your first
 statement?
 My first statement
 is that every summer, my family and I, we have
 a friend who's in marketing,
 and we get a billboard,
 a vinyl billboard,
 rip the whole thing down,
 put it down the hill
 in their backyard, and we
 waterslide down the billboard.
 Ryan: Oh!
 Kelly: Oh, that sounds
 like fun.
 Ryan: Do you steal
 the billboard from--
 No, he's in marketing,
 so they're old billboards.
 Ryan: They're old,
 so it's fine.
 Okay, and what's your second
 statement?
 My second statement is that
 every 4th of July,
 my husband and I are in
 the town parade, and we're
 a husband-and-wife
 real estate team, so I dress up
 as the Statue of Liberty,
 and we have a big American flag,
 and we throw out candy
 in the parade.
 Ryan: But he's in marketing,
 I thought.
 No, a friend is in marketing.
 Ryan: Oh.
 Let's see what the audience
 thinks on this.
 Kelly: You've got
 an honest face.
 Ryan: You do.
 Sliding down the vinyl
 billboard.
 Kelly: Huh.
 Ryan: So you put water on it.
 Yeah, we get a hose
 and put it at the top.
 Ryan: Do you soap, like--
 Yup, we get dish soap
 at the top, and the kids all
 squirt it down--
 Kelly: That sounds dangerous,
 like you could really
 hurt yourself.
 Ryan: That sounds fun.
 Kelly: Even on the
 Slip 'n Slide, right?
 It's a grass hill.
 Kelly: Adults over the age
 of 12 and if you weigh more
 than blah, blah, blah...
 It's a grass hill.
 Ryan: It's a grass hill.
 I--I like that story.
 What do you think?
 Kelly: I think that that's--
 okay, I'm gonna--I don't want
 to--it's the 4th of July,
 so for the sake of harmony,
 I'm gonna go with you,
 but in the back of my mind,
 I want it noted that I actually
 believe that is BS, okay?
 [laughter]
 Ryan: In the name of harmony,
 is it true that you slide
 down the billboard?
 Am I supposed to tell you
 right now?
 Ryan: Yes, right now.
 Yes, it's true.
 [cheers and applause]
 Ryan: Happy holiday.
 Kelly: Wow.
 Ryan: Thank you, audience.
 Thank you.
 Yeah.
 Kelly: Now you and a lucky
 member of our studio audience
 will each receive a $500
 gift card from World Market.
 [shrieks]
 Yeah!
 4th of July!
 Ryan: Fishbowl.
 Kelly: Huh?
 Ryan: Right here.
 Kelly: Oh, fishbowl.
 Yeah, sorry.
 Ryan: We've got your tickets,
 everybody.
 Kelly: There's nothing like
 doing this show
 like it's the first time...
 Ryan: We've ever done it.
 Kelly: Even though
 it's my 9,000th show.
 Uh, 40, number 40.
 Ryan: Number 40?
 Yeah!
 Ryan: Right there?
 Whoo!
 Ryan: Happy 4th.
 Thank you so much
 for being here.
 Kelly: Thank you very much.
 Thanks.
 Ryan: Let's see.
 Now dim the lights, because--
 Kelly: Oh, is this where
 we reveal the winning dancer?
 Ryan: The results...
 Kelly: Oh, my gosh.
 Ryan: Of our dance-off
 are in.
 The person voted
 as this year's winner
 and getting a $500
 gift certificate to Omaha Steaks
 is...
 We'll find out after the break.
 [groans and laughter]
 Kelly: [laughs]
 Just kidding.
 Calm down.
 Ryan: It is Carla!
 Carla from El Dorado Hills,
 California.
 [cheers and applause]
 Good job, Carla!
 Kelly: That's good sportsmen.
 Thank you for playing,
 and happy 4th of July.
 Ryan: Coming up next,
 the cast of "Stranger Things."
 We're right back on the 4th.
 Just whatever.
 Kelly: I know; I was like...
 [upbeat music]

 Announcer: Still ahead
 on "Live," O.A.R. will perform their latest hit.
 We'll continue to celebrate
 Independence Day
 with 4th of July games,
 when more lucky members
 of our studio audience
 will win more prizes.
 We'll play cornhole
 with the league champions.
 Coming up next, the cast
 of "Stranger Things."

 [electronic noises] [suspenseful music]

 [whispers] Now.
 [toys wind down]
 [horns blaring] [screaming]
 [cheers and applause]
 Kelly: You're scared already. Here come four of the young
 residents of the twisted
 television town
 of Hawkins, Indiana.
 From the hit series
 "Stranger Things," please
 welcome Finn Wolfhard,
 Noah Schnapp, Caleb McLaughlin,
 and Gaten Matarazzo!
 [cheers and applause]
 [upbeat rock music]

 Hi.
 Come on in.
 Ryan: Come on in.
 What's up, bro?
 Kelly: Hi, Finn.
 How are you?
 Welcome, welcome.
 Come on in.
 Hi.
 [cheers and applause]
 Ryan: Come on in.
 Kelly: Hi.
 We've never met before.
 Hi, I'm Kelly.
 Ryan: All right!
 Kelly: Hi, baby, how are you?
 Good to see you too.
 [indistinct chatter]
 Where are we going into?
 Kelly: Sit on the cushions
 there.
 Ryan: Yeah, a celebration.
 Kelly: This shouldn't be
 awkward at all.
 No.
 It's actually quite comfy.
 Yeah.
 Ryan: Isn't it nice?
 Kelly: What do you think
 of this?
 Now, you guys--listen, you guys
 are Hollywood stars.
 You must have these
 falling out of the sky.
 Ryan: That's right.
 Yeah, it's on our rider.
 Ryan: So where is everyone
 from?
 Let's see.
 I'm from New York City,
 the Big Apple.
 Ryan: You're from
 the Big Apple, okay.
 Kelly: New York City!
 Born and raised?
 Yes, born and raised.
 Kelly: All right.
 Ryan: And Finn's from
 Vancouver, right?
 I'm from Vancouver.
 Kelly: What about you?
 I'm from--my whole family
 is from Montreal,
 but I'm from New York.
 Kelly: Oh, okay, fab.
 Jersey.
 Kelly: Come on.
 Ryan: Oh, there you go.
 [cheers and applause]
 Kelly: I don't want to show
 favorites.
 I'm just saying--
 I understand.
 Kelly: People from Jersey
 understand each other.
 That's all I'm saying.
 New York is better,
 but it's okay.
 [people talking at once]
 Our families are all from
 Canada, so we're nicer.
 Kelly: Oh, you're more
 polite.
 You're more polite.
 Ryan: Now that you guys
 have worked together
 for a few seasons, I'm sure
 you get to know each other.
 Like, I know what--can't get
 under her skin, but I know
 what can wind Kelly up, right?
 Kelly: What's one thing
 that can wind me up?
 Ryan: Serving you garlic.
 Kelly: Oh, that is true.
 Ryan: If you put garlic
 in any of her food--
 I love garlic.
 Kelly: You do?
 Ryan: I love it too.
 She doesn't love it.
 Kelly: I'm very sensitive
 to it.
 Oh.
 Ryan: So do you guys know
 little things
 about each other now?
 I thought you were about
 to ask us if we knew anything
 about garlic.
 Kelly: [laughs]
 "Well..."
 Caleb's always blowing
 his nose, all the time.
 Kelly: Oh, really?
 Every day of his life.
 You know why?
 I have PTSD as a child.
 Kelly: Okay.
 I look at old pictures
 of my young self, and there's
 a lot of boogers, so I-[laughter]
 So I suffer from that,
 and I'm like--I make sure there
 is no boogers in my nose, so--
 Kelly: Wait, do you have,
 like, older siblings?
 Yeah, I do,
 but they won't tell me.
 Kelly: They didn't tell you.
 That's right, yeah.
 Ryan: Well, you should have
 people on the set that tell you
 whether--
 Oh, they do, but I just--
 when I feel something, I'm like,
 "Can I get a tissue?"
 It's not there.
 Kelly: Kelly loves
 the snot rocket.
 She just fires it right out.
 Well, it comes to the point
 where it's like we're doing
 a really serious scene,
 and Caleb's off camera,
 and I'm doing the scene.
 I look at Caleb, and he's like:
 [imitates blowing nose]
 Kelly: [laughs]
 As quietly as you can.
 Every picture of myself
 as a three-year-old child,
 it's just shiny boogers.
 But that's with every kid.
 I know.
 We've been doing scenes,
 and, like, the camera will be
 on one of us, and he'll be
 behind the camera, reading
 for us, and he'll just be blowing his nose
 during the middle of the shot.
 I'm like, "Dude, really?"
 And it makes you laugh
 so much.
 Ryan: Well, what does
 Gaten do?
 What does Gaten do?
 Kelly: He's perfect;
 he's from New Jersey.
 Gaten does, like--
 Yeah, Gaten does a lot.
 He dances and sings a lot.
 Kelly: Well, 'cause he's
 happy.
 He's from New Jersey.
 [overlapping chatter]
 Are all people
 from New Jersey happy?
 Kelly: Yes, we're all--
 No!
 Oh, God, no.
 Kelly: We are happy,
 and if you question us,
 we will fight you about it.
 Yeah, that's right.
 That's how happy we are.
 Kelly: That's right.
 We will beat you up
 over how happy we are.
 Ryan: Who has their
 driver's license among you?
 No one has it.
 Good question.
 I'm at permit.
 Ryan: You're permitting?
 Yeah, I get my license
 in September.
 Kelly: Oh, you do, okay.
 I get my license
 when I turn 18.
 Kelly: When you turn 18.
 Yeah, this year, this year.
 [laughs]
 He was always bragging about--
 Yeah, I can get go-karts.
 I got--I went in for the first
 learner's permit test,
 really excited, and I got--
 I didn't get every question
 wrong, but...
 Ryan: [laughs]
 It's why I chose acting
 over academics, and...
 Ryan: [laughs] Oh, God.
 I got one question wrong.
 It was, like, the passing thing,
 and, like, just held my head low
 when I got out.
 My mom was like, "Did you pass?"
 And I was just like, "Let's go."
 Kelly: You know what?
 You guys, get chauffeurs.
 You're on a hit show,
 for God's sake.
 I want to drive.
 We got to drive.
 [cheers and applause]
 Kelly: Yeah.
 Is everyone a chauffeur
 in the audience?
 We got a chauffer's audience.
 Now that I'm finally driving,
 I don't like being a passenger
 at all.
 Ryan: 'Cause you want to be
 in control.
 Backseat driver?
 I'm not a backseat driver.
 I try not to be, but...
 It was funny.
 My uncle, my mom's twin brother,
 told her when she first started
 driving--'cause he got
 his license first--that if
 there was a white line
 around the stop sign,
 it was optional.
 Ryan: What?
 [laughter]
 Kelly: That's really funny.
 And for those of you
 who don't know--I'm sure
 most of you do--most stop signs
 have a white line around them.
 And it took her, like,
 three months to realize
 that was not true.
 So how many stop signs--
 And no one was hurt.
 No one was hurt.
 Everyone was fine.
 Kelly: Nobody was hurt.
 I love that.
 Ryan: So you guys are on
 this massively popular show,
 "Stranger Things."
 I'm falling.
 Ryan: That's all right;
 there's a hole there.
 Kelly: There's a hole,
 we've decided.
 Just lean back and relax.
 Ryan: Is it difficult
 to keep the secrets
 of the show?
 'Cause people are always wanting
 to know what's coming up,
 what's happening, right?
 I feel like now it is,
 because we're in season three.
 In the beginning it wasn't
 so hard, because nothing
 was out.
 But now I'm forgetting
 which season I'm talking about.
 Yes.
 And then I might spoil
 something or say something about
 the season that's coming out.
 But no one catches it.
 In season one,
 we told everyone, like,
 the entire plotline.
 I was spoiling everything.
 We were like, "Okay,
 so there's this girl named
 Eleven, and then at the end,
 she disappears."
 Kelly: And everybody's like,
 "Good show."
 [overlapping chatter]
 Yeah, and then we were like,
 "Yeah, that was probably it."
 Kelly: But you do realize
 that you are portraying
 the greatest time
 in the history of time,
 the '80s.
 Yeah.
 Like, our parents are always
 telling us how they love it.
 Kelly: Your parents
 are literally telling you
 what it was like during--
 Yeah, my parents relate
 to everything--like, the towels
 that we have and--or not
 the towels.
 Our shirts have, like,
 towel material.
 Kelly: Yes, of course.
 Terrycloth.
 Kelly: Terrycloth.
 They wore that.
 Kelly: "Towel material."
 Ryan: Towel material.
 Kelly: That was adorable.
 My kids, for the first time,
 saw a wall phone
 on "Stranger Things,"
 and they said, "What is
 that thing?"
 They'd never seen a wall phone.
 There's, like, a whole bunch
 in New York City.
 Kelly: Okay, I doubt,
 before you did
 "Stranger Things,"
 if you really think back--
 Ryan: Hey, Jersey!
 Calm down, you two.
 I knew
 what a rotary phone was.
 Ryan: We're gonna take
 a break.
 Coming up, things get stranger
 when the guys play
 a hands-on guessing game
 right after this.
 Stay with us.

 Ryan: Today's the day.
 Kelly: I'm sure people have
 already binged the entire season
 while we sat here on the show,
 but we are back with the cast
 of "Stranger Things,"
 and everybody here is gonna
 participate in a game
 of What's in the Box?
 [applause]
 For this challenge,
 Ryan and the boys are gonna
 reach into these boxes here
 and guess what strange thing
 they think they're feeling.
 I am the only one that has
 the answers right here
 and will reveal
 what's in each box.
 Are you fellas ready?
 Wait, so you know
 what's in the box?
 Kelly: Yes, I know
 what's in the box.
 Ryan: We do not.
 Kelly: It is disgusting.
 Here we go. One...
 Both: Two, three.
 Kelly: Do it.
 Oh, my God, it's oatmeal!
 It's oatmeal.
 Ryan: Feels like oatmeal.
 That's oatmeal.
 Kelly: You are incorrect!
 It is relish.
 I knew it was relish!
 I smelled it.
 Ryan: Gross!
 I didn't even say my answer.
 Kelly: Next!
 Ryan: Next one, next one,
 next one.
 So you just put your hand
 into relish for no reason.
 I didn't.
 You didn't put your hand in
 for the relish?
 Wait, you didn't put
 your hand in?
 That's so unfair.
 Kelly: Finn is a thinker.
 See this?
 He's like, "I'm not putting
 my hand in."
 I double-crossed everyone.
 Ryan: Let's go. Next one.
 Kelly: Okay.
 Next one.
 On your mark.
 Get set. Go.
 Jell-O!
 Kelly: You are correct.
 Yes, Jell-O.
 Oh, yeah, that feels so good.
 That feels so good.
 Ryan: Doesn't feel as gross
 as the relish.
 Ew, dude, don't eat it.
 It's Jell-O!
 Kelly: It's Jell-O.
 It's Jell-O.
 It's like relish Jell-O.
 We don't have to wipe
 our hands.
 Kelly: Did it taste
 a little bit like relish?
 Like Jell-O.
 Kelly: Jell-O.
 Okay, good.
 Ryan: Next one?
 Kelly: Next one,
 number three.
 Marshmallow fluff.
 Oh, it's marsh--
 No.
 Oh, oh.
 Shaving cream.

 Kelly: Yes!
 It smells like shaving cream.
 Kelly: You are correct.
 Shaving cream.
 High five, high five.
 [applause]
 Kelly: You still have relish
 on your hands.
 Noah!
 That smells so good.
 It's so tempting.
 It smells so good.
 Kelly: You guys--
 Ryan: All right, next one?
 Try me.
 All right, cool.
 Ryan: Get in there.
 Kelly: You know what?
 Finn the Canadian could be
 my favorite new player
 of this game.
 "Finn the Canadian."
 Why?
 Kelly: Finn, have you put
 your hands in anything yet?
 Oh, you did.
 Okay, all right.
 I thought for sure
 it was three for three.
 Okay, next one.
 Next one.
 Feels so nice.
 Okay.
 Kelly: Okay, do it.
 Ryan: This feels great.
 Worms.
 Oh, worm--gummy worms.
 Um, n--it's a gummy worm,
 right?
 Kelly: Yeah, they are
 gummy worms.
 [cheers and applause]
 Ryan: I felt worms
 on the show before.
 Kelly: I just want to say
 one thing.
 Ryan is cheating.
 Why are they wet?
 Ryan: So they feel like
 real worms.
 Oh!
 Kelly: Ryan, you're not
 allowed to pull it out
 of the thing.
 Ryan!
 Ryan: Now you tell me.
 Kelly: Just telling you.
 Those are the rules.
 Ryan: I didn't hear that
 in the rules.
 Oh, my God.
 Kelly: This is
 for all the marbles.
 Ryan: Let's get
 to the next box.
 I won't pull it out.
 Kelly: This is
 for all the marbles.
 Ryan: High five, high five,
 high five, partner.
 All right, next one.
 Kelly: Wait, Finn,
 what is it?
 All you got from this is what?
 Clean hands.
 Kelly: Clean hands.
 Ryan: And a clean shave.
 Yeah, I'm--yeah.
 Kelly: Okay, guys, this is
 the final one, and this one is--
 you earn your--
 No!
 Kelly: Do it.
 What is it?
 Kelly: I don't know.
 What do you think it is?
 Noah, no, wait, not yet.
 Oh, I thought we were--
 Kelly: What do you think
 it is?
 Ryan: Feels like
 an intestine.
 I don't want to know
 what that is.
 Oh, my God, meatballs!
 Is it meat?
 Is it chicken?
 Is it manure?
 Ground beef?
 Kelly: It's not manure.
 Is it--
 Is it liver?
 I feel it!
 It's ground beef.
 It's ground beef.
 Kelly: It's not ground beef.
 Ryan: All right,
 we're out of guesses.
 Steak?
 Kelly: It's not snake.
 Steak.
 Kelly: Oh.
 No, it's wet hot dog buns.
 [audience groans]
 Ew.
 Kelly: You're welcome,
 everybody.
 [cheers and applause]
 Ryan: You guys
 are good sports.
 High five, high five, high five,
 high five.
 Oh!
 Kelly: Gentlemen.
 [all talking at once]
 I'm proud to present you
 with these incredible trophies.
 Ryan: Each of you are
 winners.
 Ah!
 Ryan: Thanks, guys.
 Congratulations on season three.
 Kelly: You're all winners.
 We all won?
 Kelly: You're all winners.
 I didn't guess any of them.
 Kelly: Hey, Ryan, guess what.
 Ryan: Oh, I get one too?
 Kelly: You win a prize too,
 Ry.
 All right!
 Ryan: No one goes home
 empty-handed.
 Kelly: Hey, Finn Wolfhard,
 Noah Schnapp, Caleb McLaughlin,
 and Gaten Matarazzo,
 the stars of "Stranger Things"!
 Ryan: Well done, guys.
 Well done.
 [cheers and applause]
 We'll be right back!

 Kelly: To find red and blue
 necklaces.
 Ryan: Blue for us,
 red for you.

 We have to put them

 You're not allowed to sabotage

 necklaces.
 Ryan and Sarah are looking

 Once we put them on our necks,

 And whoever wins
 wins $10 million.
 [cheers and applause]
 Ryan: The team with the most
 combined necklaces
 wins a $500 gift card

 Kelly: Which is
 the same thing as $10 million.
 Ryan: Ready?
 Yes.
 Ryan: Set.
 Go.
 [cheers and applause]
 Oh!

 [playful music playing]

 Kelly: You are--

 Kelly: You know what?
 I'm not gonna lie;
 that got violent.
 [laughs]
 Ryan: I got all the red ones.
 Kelly: Whoo!
 Ryan: Ugh...
 Gelman: Everyone count
 how many they have.
 Ryan: Okay, well, we need
 that one.
 All right, count them up, Sarah.
 How many do you have?
 One, two...
 Ryan: This was much easier
 as a kid.
 Three...
 Kelly: This one doesn't
 count?
 Ryan: Four.
 Oh, gosh.
 Ryan: That's disqualified.
 Kelly: The red one counts,
 but the blue one doesn't.
 Five, six.
 Both: Seven, eight, nine,
 ten...

 Ryan: 11, okay.
 11 blues.

 Kelly: How do you feel?
 Are you okay?
 Ryan: I'm sore.
 I'm bruised.
 I was strangled.
 Kelly: Aw!
 Ryan: I mean, Gelman,
 lots of illegal moves there.
 I've watched the tape
 in the break.
 Kelly: The only move
 that I heard that was illegal
 was taking your blue necklaces
 and throwing them outside
 of the ball pit.
 Ryan: That's--that's right,
 cheater.
 Kelly: That's right.
 It wouldn't be a 4th of July
 party without a fun game
 of cornhole.
 Ryan: All right.
 [cheers and applause]
 Kelly: Today the highest
 ranked players will be competing
 against each other at the
 national cornhole championship.
 Ryan: We have the top male
 and top female competitors
 from the American Cornhole
 League here today.
 Please welcome Cody Henderson
 and Stacia Pugh.
 [cheers and applause]
 [upbeat music]

 Kelly: Yeah!
 Ryan: How are you?
 Good. How are you?
 Kelly: Hi, Cody.
 Nice to meet you.
 Kelly: Hi, Stacia.
 I'm Kelly.
 Nice to meet you.
 Ryan: Good to see you.
 Come on--come over here.
 There you go, okay.
 Kelly: Cody, you are
 27 years old.
 How did you get into competitive
 cornholing?
 I got in in high school.
 It was just a game
 I liked to have fun.
 I found the professional
 circuit. And for the last eight years,,
 I've been playing competitively,
 traveling around the country,
 and it's been quite
 the experience.
 Ryan: And, Stacia,
 how about for you?
 For me, I've been playing
 about ten years.
 Kind of started in the
 front yard with my dad,
 you know, at family events.
 And just realized I liked
 the game and played more
 and more.
 Kelly: Played more and more.
 Okay, is there something
 we should know?
 We're not very good cornholers,
 we found out recently,
 last 4th of July.
 Ryan: Embarrassingly, we did.
 Kelly: Is there a technique?
 Is there something
 we should know?
 Like, is there a twist, a thing?
 There is.
 I mean, you know, when it comes
 to cornhole, if you can throw
 a flat bag, then you'll beat
 90% of people.
 Kelly: So the bag
 should be flat.
 Yes.
 Kelly: Okay, got it.
 Ryan: Wait it's--I don't know
 that--what that--just, okay,
 like this?
 Kelly: Flat bag.
 Ryan: And you go like this?
 Yes.
 Well, spin like a pizza.
 Ryan: Like a pizza.
 See, we're getting more tips.
 All right, let's play.
 [cheers and applause]
 Kelly: Girls versus boys.
 Yeah, yeah.
 Kelly: Okay, girls
 versus boys.
 You ready to lose again?
 Ryan: Ah, yes.
 Kelly: Okay.
 Ryan: Come on.
 Let's go down here.
 [cheers and applause]
 So you go on that side.
 Kelly: Now, am I allowed
 to block the--
 Ryan: No, you can't do
 any of that.
 Kelly: Okay.
 Can I hit Ryan for no reason?
 Ryan: Yes.
 Kelly: Okay.
 [light upbeat music]

 Oh, my God.
 Nice flat spin.
 Ryan: Good spin,
 like a pizza.
 Yes.
 Walk it right up the board.

 [cheers and applause]
 all: Oh! Kelly: Okay.
 So one got knocked in.
 What does that mean?
 Ryan: It means we got
 a big deal.
 Yeah, we're tied up there.
 Kelly: Okay.
 We call that
 a replacement bag.
 Kelly: A replacement bag.
 Okay, got it.
 Replacement bag.
 Oh!
 Kelly: Okay, now,
 you knocked in his.
 Do we get that point?
 Ryan: No.

 Oh, so close.
 [sighs]
 both: Okay, now what?
 Okay, now you're gonna
 throw them back.
 Kelly: We throw them back.
 Ryan: All right, does anyone
 have the--we calculated this?
 Yeah, so there's
 three points there.
 Ryan: These are so close,
 do we get any for that?
 No.
 No, so it would be one
 on the board, three in the hole.
 That round was eight on five.
 We get three.
 So we have a three-point lead.
 Kelly: You go first, right?
 Right, Ry?
 You'll be on that side.
 You're across from me.
 Kelly: Okay, got it.
 Okay, Ryan, lead us off.
 Kelly: And don't let any
 of this make you nervous.
 Ryan: I don't think
 I can do the pizza thing.
 Kelly: You can totally do
 the pizza.
 You love pizza.
 Ryan: I do,
 but I can't do the toss.
 Kelly: Just try it.
 Toss it.
 Toss it, Ryan.
 Toss it.
 [audience cheering]
 Oh!
 [laughter]
 All right, Kelly.
 You got this.
 Kelly: Learned a lot.
 Ryan: All right, Kelly.
 Kelly: Learned a lot.
 Okay.
 Don't--don't give me
 protective arm.
 [audience groans]
 Ryan: I almost fell
 in the pool.
 Kelly: How far over the plane
 is Ryan allowed to step?
 Ryan: Just not in the water.
 You could step up
 to the board.
 Kelly: Up to the board.
 Up to the very front
 of the board.

 Good try.
 Kelly: Okay, inching on
 up there.
 Ryan: We're getting there.

 Kelly: Aw!
 Closer, closer.
 [audience cheering]
 Aw!

 Kelly: Ooh, Ryan, that was--
 it was almost good.
 Ryan: Not good enough.
 Story of my life.
 Come on, Kelly.
 Ryan: It's harder
 than it looks.
 all: Oh!
 [cheers and applause]
 Ryan: Thanks so much.
 Nice to meet you.
 Kelly: Sorry, sorry.
 I apologize.

 championship today, 1:00 p.m.,
