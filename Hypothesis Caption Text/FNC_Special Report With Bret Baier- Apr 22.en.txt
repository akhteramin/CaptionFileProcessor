 THERE WOULD BE A POINT MAN FOR

 SUBPOENAED A WHITE HOUSE INSIDER

 AT THE ANNUAL EASTER EGG
 ROLL, PRESIDENT TRUMP WEIGHED IN
 ON TALK OFMENT, TAKING A
 WHAT?■u
 ME, WORRY?
 APPROACH.
 ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT
 IMPEACHMENT?
 THE PRESIDENT'S CONFIDENCE
 WOULD SHOW THE SINKING OF THE
 DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP, AND HOUSE
 SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI WRITING
 WHILE OUR VIEW RAINS FROM
 PERCEIVING THE INVESTIGATION OF
 THE MUELLER REPORT TO
 IMPEACHMENT, WE ALL FIRMLY AGREE
 THAT WE SHOULD PROCEED DOWN A
 PATH OF FINDING THE TRUTH.
 IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO KNOW
 THAT THE FACTS REGARDING HOLDING
 THE PRESIDENT ACCOUNTABLE CAN BE
 GAINED OUTSIDE OF IMPEACHMENT
 HEARINGS, THE ONE THAT WOULD
 TAKE UP IMPEACHMENT APPEARED TO
 HESITATE WHEN ASKED.
 Bret: DO YOU THINK THAT
 THIS IS IMPEACHABLE?
 YEAH, I DO.
 IF PROVEN, IF PROVEN, WHICH HAS
 NOT BEEN PROVEN YET, SOME OF
 THIS COULD BE IMPEACHABLE, YES.
 WHILE SOME 2020 DEMOCRATIC
 CANDIDATES HAVE STAYED AWAY FROM
 ANY TALK OF IMPEACHMENT,
 ELIZABETH WARREN SEEKING A BOOST
 TO THE LEGGING CAMPAIGN SAYS
 THAT SHE IS ALL IN.
 I JUST CALLED ON THE HOUSE TO
 INITIATE IMPEACHMENT
 PROCEEDINGS.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP MOCKS SUCH
 TALK FIRING BACK ONLY HIGH
 CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS CAN LEAD
 TO IMPEACHMENT.
 THERE WERE NO CRIMES BUT I MEANO
 U CANNOT IMPEACH.
 IT WAS THE DEMOCRATS THAT
 COMMITTED THE CRIMES, NOT YOUR
 REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT.
 THE PRESIDENT WAS ALSO ON
 OFFENSE ON THE FINANCIAL FRONT,
 SUING CHAIRMAN ELIJAH CUMMINGS
 FOR TRYING TO SUBPOENA FINANCIAL
 RECORDS FROM THE ACCOUNTING
 FIRM.
 IN THE LAWSUIT TRUMP ATTORNEYS
 ATTACKING THE SUBPOENA WRITING
 "IT'S GOAL IS TO EXPOSE
 PLAINTIFF'S PRIVATE
 INFORMATIONAL FOR THE SAKE OF
 EXPOSURE THAT IT WILL TURN UP
 SOMETHING THAT DEMOCRATS CAN USE
 ■■■ TOOL AGAINST THE
 PRESIDENT NOW AND IN THE 2020
 ELECTION."
 SOURCES SAY THAT THE SUBPO
 GOES WELL BEYOND REQUEST FOR THE
 PRESIDENT'S FINANCIAL RECORDS,
 ALSO SEEKING THOSE AND ALL OF
 HIS CHILDREN INCLUDING BARRON
 AND TIFFANY TRUMP, MICHAEL
 COHEN, A FELON WHO HAS PLEADED
 GUILTY TO CONGRESS SAYS THAT THE
 PRESIDENT HAD MISREPRESENTED HIS
 NET WORTH WHEN HE WAS A PRIVATE
 CITIZEN.
 ELIJAH CUMMINGS APPEARED
 UNFAZED.
 IN A STATEMENT THIS AFTERNOON
 SAYING THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS A
 LONG HISTORY OF TRYING TO USE
 BASELESS LAWSUITS TO ATTACK HIS
 ADVERSARIES.
 BUT THERE WAS SIMPLY NO VALID
 LEGAL BASIS T0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;;
 THE DULY AUTHORIZED SUBPOENA
 FROM CONGRESS.
 THE ATTORNEYS INSISTE0; THAT HE
 HAS LONG0;0;0;0;0;N UNDER THIS
 GUARANTY OF THEAL A
 THAT IT IS0;0;0;0;0; THE IRS PUT
 CONGRESS IS TO LOOK INTO0;0;0;0S
 LOOKED AT PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR
 YEARS UPON YEARS AND0;0;0; HAS D
 NO REASON TO BRING ANY KIND OF
 ACTION CIVIL OR CRIMINAL AGAINST
 THE PRESIDENT.
 Bret: CHAIRMAN NADLER
 DROPPED THE SUBPOENA AS HOUSE
 DEMOCRATS ARE MEETING ON THIS
 CONFERENCE CALL ABOUT NEXT STEPS
 AFTER THE MUELLER REPORT.
 THE WHITE HOUSE DID NOT HOLD
 BACK, DID NOT ISSUE EXECUTIVE
 PRIVILEGE FOR ANY OF THOSE
 MUELLER REPORT OR THE TESTIMONY
 BEFORE, IS THERE A THOUGHT THAT
 THEY MAY STEP UP AGAIN0;0;0;0;0?
 WE DO NOT  IF0;0;0;0;0;0;0; E
 GOING TO EXERT EXECUTIVE
 PRIVILEGE, TESTIFYING BEFORE
 CONGRESS, BUT THE ENTIRE MUELLER
 INVESTIGATION THAT CONTAINED
 UNDER ARTICLE TWO OF THE
 INVESTIGATION WHICH IS THE
 EXECUTIVE BRANCH.
 REALLY IT WAS DON MCGANN, THE
 MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH
 TALKING TO ANOTHER MEMBER WHEN
 IT CAME TO THE MUELLER
 QUESTIONING.
 BUT IF CONGRESS WERE TO SUBPOENA
 HIM, THEN THAT IS ARTICLE 1 OF
 THE CONSTITUTION AGAINST ARTICL.
 I ASSUME THAT THE
 PRESIDENT UNDER THAT PREMISE
 WOULD BE ABLE TO EXERT EXECUTIVE
 PRIVILEGE.
 IT WOULD BE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT.
 TO THE POINT IS THAT THEY DID
 NOT EXERT EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE
 OVER THE RELEASE OF THE MUELLER
 REPORT.
 BECAUSE THEY DID NOT DO THAT,
 MAYBE YOU ARE IN A PROBLEM TO
 PUT THE TWO FACE BACK INTO THE
 TUBE IN TERMS OF WHETHER THEY
 DID NOT EXERT EXECUTIVE
 PRIVILEGE FOR DON MCGANN TALKING
 TO MUELLER, THIS IS DIFFERENT
 BECAUSE IT IS THE ADMINISTRATION
 AND CONGRESS, TWO DIFFERENT
 BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT.
 Bret: UNCHARTED WATERS
 EITHER WAY, SENIOR POLITICAL
 ANALYST BRIT HUME IS WITH US
 TONIGHT.
 WE MENTIONED THAT THE CONFERENCE
 CALL HAS BEEN GOING ON.
 DEMOCRATS CONSIDERING THE WAY
 FORWARD, SOME VERY AGGRESSIVELY
 SAYING THAT IT NEEDS TO GO DOWN
 IN IMPEACHMENT ROAD.
 THE KEY THING IS INTENT, RIGHT?
 RIGHT, THERE ARE THINGS IN
 THE MUELLER REPORT THAT TRUMP
 AND HIS ALLIES MAY HAVE DONE
 THAT ONE COULD BE PULLED
 TOGETHER IN SOME IMPEACHMENT
 ARTICLE FOR OBSTRUCTION.
 BUT THERE ARE SOMETHINGS THAT
 WOULD BE PROBLEMATIC, ONE OF
 THEM IS INTENT.
 THE ONE THING OF COURSE, WE NOW
 KNOW THAT THE THING THAT THE
 PRESIDENT WAS BEING INVESTIGATED
 FOR POTENTIALLY CRIMINAL HE WAS
 CONSPIRACY OR COOPERATION WITH
 THE RUSSIAN ATTEMPT TO
 INTERFERE, INFLUENCE THE
 ELECTION, HE HAS BEEN CLEARED OF
 THAT NOW.
 SO HE WOULD HAVE BEEN
 OBSTRUCTING AN INVESTIGATION
 INTO SOMETHING HE DID NOT DO.
 THAT WOULD WAY, THAT WOULD VEER
 ON THE QUESTION OF INTENT,
 CRIMINAL INTENT.
 AND REMEMBER WHEN JAMES COMEY
 DECLINED TO PROSECUTE
 HILLARY CLINTON FOR MISHANDLING
 CLASSIFIED INFORMATION, WHAT WAS
 MISSING IN THE END?
 AND WHAT TURNED THE TIDE?
 A LACK OF INTENT, THAT PROVES
 HOW IMPORTANT IT WOULD BE.
 IN ADDITION, THERE IS THIS, IF
 THEY WERE TO PROCEED AGAINST THE
 PRESIDENT ON THIS SET OF FACTS,
 AND IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE THAT
 THE CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION
 WILL HONOR ANYTHING THAT ROBERT
 MUELLER WITH THE INVESTIGATIVE
 RESOURCES DID NOT TURN UP, IF
 THEY WERE TO TRY TO DO THAT,
 THEY MIGHT KEEP THEIR EYE ON ONE
 THING, AND THE FACT THAT THEY
 HAVE INVESTIGATIONS GOING ON
 WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF
 JUSTICE, ONE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S
 INVESTIGATION, AND YOU HAVE A
 PROSECUTOR NAMED HUBER OUT IN
 UTAH WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO LOOK
 INTO MISCONDUCT IN THE HANDLING
 OF THE BEGINNING OF THIS
 INVESTIGATION.
 AND IF THOSE THINGS WERE TO
 BRING -BEAR FRUIT WITH
 INFORMATION THAT CAST DOUBT ON
 LEGITIMACY OF THE WHOLE THING,
 THAT WOULD ARISE RIGHT IN THE
 MIDDLE OF WHAT WOULD BE THE
 IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDING, AND IT
 WOULD PRESENT A SERIOUS
 POLITICAL PROBLEM FOR A VOTE TO
 IMPEACH.
 Bret: THIS IS A CONUNDRUM
 FOR SOME DEMOCRATS, NANCY PELOSI
 HAS SIGNALED PUTTING ON THE
 BRAKES WHILE OTHERS ARE GOING
 FULL STEAM AHEAD.
 THAT'S RIGHT, AND I THINK
 THAT NOW THAT ELIZABETH WARREN
 IS OUT SAYING THAT THE
 IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDING SHOULD
 BEGIN, WITHIN THAT JOSTLING IT
 HAS TO GET PRETTY SERIOUS WITH
 ALL OF THOSE CANDIDATES RUNNING
 ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE.
 THAT -SHOULD THAT QUESTION
 WILL BE PUT TO EACH AND EVERY
 ONE OF THESE CANDIDATES,
 IMPEACHMENT OR NOT, AND THEY ARE
 GOING TO HAVE TO FACE UP TO IT,
 AND SOME OF THEM MAY WANT TO
 THINK THAT IT IS A BAD IDEA
 POLITICALLY TO BE UNDER THAT
 ROAD, BUT THEY WILL BE UNDER
 PRESSURE TO DO IT.
 AND IT IS IMPORTANT AS A LARGE
 BASIS OF THE PARTY THAT WILL
 WANT IMPEACHMENT, SIGNIFICANT
 MAJORITIES SAY THAT THEY WANT
 HIM IMPEACHED, SO WE WILL
 PROBABLY HEAR MORE ABOUT THIS,
 AND IT DOES PRESENT AN ISSUE FOR
 THE LEADERSHIP IN THE CONGRESS
 AND ALSO FOR SOMEONE TRYING TO
 GET ELECTED PRESIDENT, BECAUSE
 IMPEACHMENT HOLDS SOME RISKS.

 IMPEACHMENT PER PRESIDENT TRUMP.
 TONIGHT ONE THING, JUST ABOUT
 ALL OF THEM AND OF FACT MOST
 AMERICANS AGREE ON.
 CORRESPONDENT ALICIA CUNEO IN
 DENVER ON THE LEGALIZATION OF
 MARIJUANA.
 ONCE POLITICAL KRYPTONITE
 LEGALIZING MARIJUANA IS A KEY
 ISSUE THAT DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL
 HOPEFULS ARE HOPING TO ADD
 STREET CREDIT TO THEIR BASE.
 THIS IS A LITMUS TEST AS ALL
 OF THE DIFFERENT CANDIDATES ARE
 COMPETING TO BE PERCEIVED AS THE
 MOST AGGRESSIVE CANDIDATE.
 FINDING 60% OF VOTERS FAVORED
 LEGALIZING MARIJUANA.
 THREE CANDIDATES PUSHING FOR
 LEGALIZATION.
 WHILE, IN CASE YOU HAVE NOT
 NOTICED, A LOT OF PEOPLE ON OUR
 SIDE ARE DOING JUST THAT.
 DO NOT TO TALK TO ME ABOUT
 LEGALIZING MARIJUANA UNLESS IN
 THE SAME BREATH YOU TALK TO ME
 ABOUT EXPUNGING THE RECORDS OF
 MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.
 CORY BOOKER HAS A PLAN TO
 LEGALIZE MARIJUANA AT THE
 FEDERAL LEVEL, 2020
 CONTENDERS ARE SPONSORS.
 HAVE YOU EVER SMOKED?
 I HAVE.
 I THINK IT GIVES A LOT OF PEOPLE
 LEGAL IN TEN STATES IN THE
 DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
 FORMER COLORADO GOVERNOR OVERSAW
 THE NATION'S FIRST EXPERIMENT TO
 LEGALIZE EVEN THOUGH HE
 INITIALLY OPPOSED IT.
 OF THEES INASSIFICAT
 FEDERAL PRO
  BANKING.
 IF YOU WANT TO ARREST FOR
 HOW YOU GET CORRUPTION AND
 CREATE A GENERATION OF
 GANGSTERS, MAKE SURE A NEW
 INDUSTRY IS OFF OF CASH.
 WITH A FOCUS ON DRUGS AT THE
 BORDER, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN
 HANDS OFF AS A CANDIDAYS
 IT SHOULD BE UP TO THE STATES.
 DISTANCE AND THE MESSAGE HAS
 HARD AND.
  HE STRONGLY BELIEVES THAT WE
 HAVE TO ENFORCE FEDERAL LAW.
 THIS WILL BE AN ISSUE FOR THE
 DEMOCRATS AND THEY WILL TRY TO
 USE THIS AGAINST TRUMP AND THE
 GENERAL, BUT THEY DO NOT THINK
 THAT IT WILL WORK VERY WELL.
 WHEREVER THEY LAND, THERE IS
 MAJOR MONEY ON THE LINE, AND
 COLORADO ALONE, MARIJUANA
 BUSINESS REPORTED $1.5 BILLION
 IN SALES LAST YEAR.
 Bret: THANK YOU.
 THE PRESIDENT SAYS HE IS NOT
 WORRIED ABOUT IMPEACHMENT AT
 ALL.
 CONFERENCE CALL OF HOUSE
 DEMOCRATS JUST WRAPPED UP.
 AND THE PANEL WILL WEIGH IN ON
 EVERYTHING.
 STAY WITH US.

   pay as much for insurance...
             As not safe drivers!
                AH!
     That was a stunt driver.
      That's why Esurance has       this DriveSense® app.
       The safer you drive,
        the more you save.
       Don't worry, I'm not          using my phone
         and talking to a      camera while driving...
                       I'm being                           towed.
                      By the way,
              I'm actually             a safe driver.
           I'm just pretending to            be a not safe driver.
               Cool.
                Bye Dennis Quaid!

      But I'd rather be here        with my little man
   than anywhere with migraine.

   And I aim to say that more.
            Aimovig...
    a preventive treatment for      migraine in adults...
  reduces the number of monthly          migraine days.
 For some, that number can be cut         in half or more.
   The most common side effects            are pain,
    redness or swelling at the injection site and constipation.
      Aim to be there more.
       Talk to your doctor          about Aimovig.
   (Mom VO) It's easy to shrink

      Especially these days.
     (Dad) I think it's here.
 (Mom VO) Especially at this age.
 (Big sister) Where are we going?
  (Mom VO) It's a big, beautiful  world out there.

        My reputation was         trashed online,
   I felt completely helpless.
  My entire career and business        were in jeopardy.
  I called Reputation Defender.

     If you're under attack,
       I recommend calling
       Reputation Defender.

 INITIATE IMPEACHMENTTHE HOUSE PROCEEDINGS.
 THEY STILL HAVE NOT FOUND THE
 MESSAGE, SO THEIR ONLY OPTION IS
 TO ATTACK THIS PRESIDENT.
 SOME OF THIS WOULD BE
 IMPEACHABLE, YES.
 OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE WOULD BE
 IMPEACHABLE.
 THIS IS HOW IT STARTED.
 IT IS A VERY DIFFICULT
 DECISION, WE WILL HAVE A CAUCUS
 ABOUT THIS OVER THE NEXT COUPLE
 OF WEEKS TO TRY TO FIGURE
 WHEST COURSE IS.
 ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT
 IMPEACHMENT, MR. PRESIDENT  ?
 Bret: EASTER EGG ROLL WITH
 IMPEACHMENT QUESTIONS CAME AFTER
 THE PRESIDENT, ONLY HIGH CRIMES
 AND MISDEMEANORS CAN LEAD TO
 IMPEACHMENT, NO COLLUSION, NO
 OBSTRUCTION, SO YOU CAN'T
 IMPEACH.
 IT WAS THE DEMOCRATS THAT
 COMMITTED THE CRIMES, AND ANGER
 REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT, TABLES ARE
 TURNING ON THE WITCH HUNT.
 YOU HEARD ADAM SCHIFF MENTIONED
 THAT THEY WERE GOING TO CAUCUS
 ABOUT THE
           WAY FORWARD. HOUSE DEMOCRATS DID HAVE A
 CONFERENCE CALL THIS EVENING.
 IT JUST OPENED UP -WRAPPED UP
 MOMENTS AGO.
 TWO SOURCES ARE SAYING THAT
 FINANCIAL SERVICES CHAIRWOMAN
 MAXINE WATERS IS PUSHING FOR
 IMPEACHMENT.
 SHE IS SAYING THAT SHE IS NOT
 PUSHING HER COLLEAGUES TO JOIN
 HER.
 SHE IS SIMPLY SAYING WHAT SHE
 THINKS, MAKING HER VIEWS KNOWN.
 TO THE HIGHEST PROFILE DEMOCRAT
 URGING IMPEACHMENT, BUT NOT
 REALLY A SURPRISE, SHE HAS BEEN
 ORDERING IMPEACHMENT BEFORE THE
 MUELLER REPORT.
 LET'S BRING IN THE PANEL, CHRIS
 STIREWALT, SUSAN PAGE,
 WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF AT USA
 TODAY, AND ALSO THE AUTHOR OF
 THE NEW BOOK, THE MATRIARCH
 "BARBARA BUSH IN THE MAKING OF
 THE DYNASTY" DEBUTING NUMBER
 THREE ON "THE NEW YORK TIMES"
 LIST, AND CHIEF CORRESPONDENT OF
 THE "WASHINGTON EXAMINER,"
 SUSAN, CONGRATULATIONS ON THE
 BOOK.
 AT THE MEETING, IT IS A
 CONUNDRUM.
 I TALKED TO BRIT HUME EARLIER IN
 THE CHAUFFEUR DEMOCRATS ON THE
 WAY CONSIDERING WHAT THE MUELLER
 REPORT DID NOT FIND PREY TO
 SPEAK ON DEMOCRATS ARE DIVIDED
 ON THE QUESTION OF WHETHER
 IMPEACHMENT MAKES SENSE.
 DEMOCRATS ARE UNITED IN THINKING
 THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE
 THINGS THAT THEY DO NOT LIKE.
 THEY ARE AT ODDS WITH THE OATH
 THAT HE TOOK AN OFFICE, BUT THE
 LEADERSHIP OF THE HOUSE
 DEMOCRATS INCLUDING NANCY PELOSI
 CLEARLY DO NOT WANT TO GO DOWN
 THE IMPEACHMENT ROAD.
 WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO IS
 HAVE INVESTIGATIONS FOR THE
 IMPEACHMENT MEANING, YOU LOOK AT
 WHAT THE HOUSE JUDICIARY
 COMMITTEE HAS ALREADY LINED UP
 TESTIMONY BY JOHN McCANN, THE
 FORMER WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL, BY
 BILL BARR, BY ROBERT MUELLER,
 THE SPECIAL COUNSEL, ALL OF
 THOSE ARE SCHEDULED FOR MAY, SO
 THEY MAY NOT CALL IT
 IMPEACHMENT, BUT THEY WILL HAVE
 INVESTIGATIONS.
 Bret: THEY ARE CLEARLY
 DIVIDED RIGHT NOW, BUT I THINK,
 AND THEY HAVE GOTTEN ALL EXCITED
 ABOUT ALL OF THE DETAILS THAT
 HAVE COME OUT ESPECIALLY ABOUT
 ALLEGED OBSTRUCTION IN THE
 MUELLER REPORT, BUT THE FACT IS
 THAT IT IS GOING TO MAKE IT MORE
 DIFFICULT FOR THEM.
 ONE, IT DID NOT FIND COLLUSION
 OR CONSPIRACY OR COORDINATION,
 AND TWO, IT DID NOT FIND THAT
 THE INVESTIGATION WAS ACTUALLY
 OBSTRUCTED.
 IT FOUND THAT THE PRESIDENT
 ORDERED PEOPLE TO PERFORM
 OBSTRUCTIVE ACTS AND THEY SAID
 "NO."
 HE BACKED DOWN AND THAT DID NOT
 HAPPEN, DEMOCRATS WILL BE
 ACCUSING THE PRESIDENT OF TRYING
 UNSUCCESSFULLY TO OBSTRUCT AN
 INVESTIGATION INTO SOMETHING
 THAT DID NOT HAPPEN.
 AND I THINK THAT POLITICALLY
 THAT IS THE CASE WHERE THE
 PRESIDENT CAN MAKE A STRONG
 DEFENSE.
 Bret: OUR FRIEND JONATHAN
 TURLEY, LAW PROFESSOR WROTE A
 COLUMN IN THE HILL SAYING
 DESPITE IDENTIFYING TEN
 TROUBLING EPISODES THAT COULD BE
 DEFINED AS OBSTRUCTION, MUELLER
 WILL NOT SAY WITH CONFIDENCE
 THAT HE ACTED WITH INTENT.
 FINDING EVIDENCE THAT HE WANTED
 TO LEND THE SCOPE OF THE
 INVESTIGATION, BUT THAT IS NOT
 NECESSARILY INTENT, EVEN THE
 BEST WORD PRESIDENT TRUMP
 SEEKING TO FIRE MUELLER WAS
 JUSTIFIED AS BASED ON THE FEAR
 OF THE CONTRACT OF INTEREST LIKE
 IMPEACHABLE ACTS, SHOWING OF
 INTENT, NOT IN AN ARRAY OF
 IMPOSSIBLE ATTEMPT.
 AND WHAT WE ARE GETTING AT IS IF
 THE HOUSE DEMOCRATS WHO MOVE
 FORWARD, IT GETS STICKY, BECAUSE
 HE WOULD THINK THAT THE SENATE
 AND REPUBLICAN CONTROL IS NOT
 GOING TO CONVICT ANYWAY.
 SENATE MAJORITY IS ALL THAT
 IS NEEDED TO BRING THE CHARGES,
 THAT IS THE INDICTMENT, BUT YOU
 NEED A SUPER MAJORITY,
 TWO-THIRDS TO CONVICT HIM
 REMOVE.
 THE DEMOCRATS KNOW THAT THAT
 WILL NOT HAPPEN AND NOT ANYTIME
 SOON.
 IMPEACHMENT IS A POLITICAL
 QUESTION, NOT A LEGAL ONE.
 AND FOR ALL OF THE GOOD WORK OF
 ALL OF THE LEGAL SCHOLARS IN THE
 WORLD, IT COMES DOWN TO A
 FUNDAMENTAL POLITICAL QUESTION.
 THE QUESTION HERE IS WHAT THE
 AMERICAN PEOPLE, COUNTENANCE AND
 IMPEACHMENT.
 AND THEY PROBABLY KNOW THAT
 THERE IS NOTHING THAT ANYONE WHO
 VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP IN 2016
 COULD HAVE READ IN THE MUELLER
 REPORT, SCSI AS MUCH OF IT WAS,
 THAT WAS NOT ALREADY BAKED INTO
 THE
 FIGURING OF DONALD TRUMP, HE DID
 NOT RUN AS POPE FRANCIS IN 2016S
 STUFF AND HIS CHARACTER BEFORE
 HE RAN, THAT'S WHY IT IS A
 NONSTARTER.
 Bret: THE DECISION THAT
 DEMOCRATS WILL MAKE WILL BE THE
 INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT,
 OTHER INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE
 EARLY PART OF THE INVESTIGATION
 WHICH COULD ILLUMINATE SOME
 ASPECTS OF THAT.
 THE MUELLER REPORT MAKES IT
 LESS LIKELY THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP
 FACES IMPEACHMENT, BUT
 PRESIDENT TRUMP'S TAX RETURN
 INTO THE ORGANIZATION'S BUSINESS
 PRACTICES INTO WHAT HAS HAPPENED
 THE VARIOUS AGENCIES AROUND TOWN
 THAT HAVE HAD VERY LITTLE
 OVERSIGHT IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS
 OF THE ADMINISTRATION.
 NOTHING IS GOING TO STOP THAT.
 Bret: IS IMPEACHMENT THE
 LITMUS TEST OF THE GREEN NEW
 DEAL OR A MEDICARE FOR ALL IN

 THAT IS THE TASK THAT
 NANCY PELOSI IS TRYING TO
 NAVIGATE.
 YOU SAW HER ADDRESS A COLLEAGUE
 IN THE CONFERENCE CALL MAKING
 THE CASE AND AGREEING THAT
 DONALD TRUMP HAS DONE THINGS
 THAT MAKE HIM UNFIT FOR OFFICE,
 BUT AGREEING THAT THEY NEED TO
 PURSUE THE TRUTH BUT SAYING THAT
 YOU CAN DO THAT WITH
 INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE SHORT OF
 IMPEACHMENT.
 ONE LAST THING THAT THE
 LEADERSHIP IS AWARE OF, THE
 TIMING OF THIS WILL BE CRAZY.
 IF THE DEMOCRATS START NOW, IT
 WILL TAKE A WILD TO REV UP THE
 IMPEACHMENT REGIME, AND WHEN
 THEY GET GOING, WE WILL BE SMACK
 IN THE MIDDLE OF A PRESIDENTIAL
 ELECTION CAMPAIGN WHERE THE EPG
 IS RUNNING FOR REELECTION, WHEN
 BILL CLINTON WAS IMPEACHED, IT
 WAS IN '98 AND '99 AFTER HE HAD
 BEEN REELECTED, AND THAT WAS
 AFTER HE HAD BEEN REELECTED IN
 1972, NIXON.
 DOING THIS IN THE MIDDLE OF A
 CAMPAIGN WOULD PUT THE WHOLE
 PROCESS ON STEROIDS.
 IT'S CRAZY ENOUGH TO BEGIN WITH.
 THE LEADERSHIP IS VERY WORRIED
 ABOUT JUST THE UNPREDICTABLE
 ASPECT OF THAT.
 Bret: AND THE COUNTERPUNCH
 ARE IN CHIEF WHO CLEARLY WILL
 NOT HOLD BACK.
 PANEL, THANK YOU.
 MASSACRE, THE TERRORIST ATTACK
 THERE.

     IF YOU'RE AGE 50 TO 85,
   AND LOOKING TO BUY LIFE   INSURANCE ON A FIXED BUDGET,
     REMEMBER THE THREE P'S.
     -THE THREE P'S?     -WHAT ARE THE THREE P'S?
 THE THREE P'S OF LIFE INSURANCE ON A FIXED BUDGET
        ARE PRICE, PRICE,        AND PRICE.
     A PRICE YOU CAN AFFORD,
   A PRICE THAT CAN'T INCREASE,
      AND A PRICE      THAT FITS YOUR BUDGET.
   I'M 65 AND TAKE MEDICATIONS.
         WHAT'S MY PRICE?
       YOU CAN GET COVERAGE       FOR $9.95 A MONTH.
        I JUST TURNED 80.
         WHAT'S MY PRICE?
          $9.95 A MONTH          FOR YOU TOO.
       CALL NOW ABOUT       THE #1 MOST POPULAR
    WHOLE LIFE INSURANCE PLAN,
    AVAILABLE THROUGH    THE COLONIAL PENN PROGRAM.
       NO MEDICAL EXAM,       NO HEALTH QUESTIONS.
         YOUR ACCEPTANCE         IS GUARANTEED.
      SO CALL NOW      FOR FREE INFORMATION.
 TODAY I'M ANNOUNCING THAT WE
 WILL NO LONGER GRANT ANY
 EXEMPTIONS.
 WE ARE GOING TO ZERO.
 WE ARE GOING TO ZERO ACROSS THE
 BOARD TO.
 IF WE CAN TRULY STOP RAINING
 AND EXPORTS,/  TALKING MAYBE
 1,000,000.542 MILLION BARRELS
 PER DAY THAT NOW HAS TO BE
 FILLED BY SOMEBODY.
 IT IS NOT ABOUT SUPPLY, IT IS
 ABOUT POLICY.
 IT IS ABOUT WHETHER THOSE
 COUNTRIES WOULD BE WILLING TO GO
 ALONG WITH THIS DEMAND.
 THIS IS THE BIGGEST LEVERAGE
 WE HAVE, IF YOU WHEN THEY SEEK A
 CHANGE IN BEHAVIOR, YOU HAVE TO
 SHOW SERIOUSNESS OF PURPOSE ON
 THE OIL.
 Bret: THE U.S. IS PUTTING
 THE BOOTS ON THE NECK OF IRAN
 WHEN IT COMES TO FINANCES, THAT
 IS SQUEEZING THE OIL REVENUES.
 IF YOU LOOK, THE WAIVERS HAVE
 BEEN CUT OFF, LAST NOVEMBER THE
 U.S. GAVE EIGHT COUNTRIES FAVORS
 TO CONTINUE TO BUY IRANIAN OIL,
 THEY HAVE ELIMINATED THAT
 IMPORT, GREECE, ITALY, AND
 TAIWAN, FIVE REMAINING COUNTRIES
 HAVE THESE WAIVERS, CHINA,
 INDIA, TURKEY, SOUTH KOREA, AS
 OF TONIGHT THAT STOPS.
 BACK WITH THE PANEL, BIG DEAL?
 I THINK IT IS, THAT SHOWS
 THAT THE TERM ADMINISTRATION IS
 REALLY, REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT
 THIS, NOT GIVING ANY MORE
 WAIVERS.
 IN THE WAKE OF PULLING OUT OF
 THE IRANIAN NUCLEAR DEAL, MAKING
 SURE THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE THESE
 MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
 TO SPEND DESTABILIZING THE
 MIDDLE EAST.
 SO I THINK THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD
 PROBABLY BELIEVE MIKE POMPEO
 WHEN HE SAYS THIS.
 Bret: TURKEY HAD SOME
 PUSHBACK PUBLICLY, BUT OTHER
 THAN THAN THAT, SILENCE FROM THE
 OTHER COUNTRIES.
 I THINK THAT JAPAN IS
 PROBABLY GOING TO GO ALONG WITH
 THIS, ONE OF THE CLOSEST ALLIES,
 TURKEY, NATO, WE GET TO OTHER
 COUNTRIES, WHAT ARE WE WILLING
 TO DO?
 HOW FAR WE WILLING TO    TO GO O
 ENFORCE ON CHINA?
 HOW FAR WILL WE GO TO ENFORCE?
 I DON'T KNOW, BUT AS A STATEMENT
 OF RESOLVE AS A PUBLIC STATEMENT
 TO SAY, THIS IS HAPPENING AND WE
 ARE GOING THERE, THAT IS A
 PRETTY BOLD MOVE.
 THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE
 BACK END?
 LET'S SAY THAT THE REGIME
 CRUMBLES, WHAT HAPPENS?
 WE DON'T KNOW.
 WE DON'T KNOW, AND WE DON'T
 KNOW HOW THIS WILL GO, BUT IT IS
 COMPLETELY CONSISTENT WITH WHAT
 THE ADMINISTRATION HAS SAID.
 NONE OF THESE COUNTRIES SHOULD
 BE A SURPRISE THAT THESE WAIVERS
 ARE EXPIRING.
 AND IT IS NO MORE SIGN THE
 PRESIDENT COMPETENT IN DOING
 WHAT HE WANTS TO DO AND
 DISREGARDING WHAT SOME STATE
 TIES WITH FOREIGN POLICY EXPERTS
 CONCERNED WITH BEING ISOLATED
 FROM ALLIES OR THE IMPACT ON
 CHINA, ON OTHER ISSUES.
 I THINK THAT ON FOREIGN POLICY
 HE IS INCREASINGLY WILLING TO DO
 WHAT HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO DO.
 Bret: IN PART BECAUSE U.S.
 ENERGY AND OUR ABILITY TO
 PRODUCE OUR OWN OIL AND NATURAL
 GAS.
 JUST BECAUSE THERE IS THAT, AND
 THE PRESIDENT WEEDED OUT THAT
 THE SAUDI ARABIANS, AND
 EVERYBODY WILL KEEP THE SUPPLY
 UP, BUT TO WHAT SUSAN SAID, I
 THINK THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS
 MORE CONFIDENT ABOUT THIS,
 BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER TIMES
 THAT HE HAS BEEN TOLD THAT THE
 WORLD WOULD END IF YOU DID
 SOMETHING, AND HE DID IT AND THE
 WORLD DID NOT END, I'M THINKINGT
 MOVING U.S. EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM
 WHERE THERE WERE PREDICTIONS OF
 DIRE CONSEQUENCES THAT WOULD
 OCCUR, YET HE DID IT.
 IT HAS BEEN FINE.
 AND THAT IS THE VIEW ON THISOO
 PRAY Bret: HERE IS THE
 PRESIDENT ON THE SRI LANKAN
 ATTACK.
 WHAT A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE
 THIN
 UNTHINKABLE.
 A LONG TIME AND PEOPLE DO NOT
 WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT, IT IS A
 TERRIBLE THING, I JUST SPOKE
 WITH THE PRIME MINIS
 I SPOKE WITH THE VARIOUS
 GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, AND WE ARE
 WORKING WITH SRI LANKA, BUT THAT
 IS A TERRIBLE THING.
 Bret: 300 DEAD, IN THE
 SUICIDE ATTACKS ON CHRISTIANS.
 SPECIFIC, AND IT WAS KNOWN BY
 NUMEROUS INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES.
 THERE COULD BE A LINK TO
 ISIS, OR LARGER EFFORTS ACROSS
 THE GLOBE AND ALL OF THESE
 THINGS.
 THIS IS WHAT WE WORRY ABOUT.
 THIS IS THE CONCERN THAT EVERY
 AMERICAN HAS, BECAUSE IT COULD
 COME HERE.
 AND FOR AMERICAN CHRISTIANS,
 THIS IS A SOMBER MOMENT.
 Bret: IF YOU LOOK AT THE
 CHART OF CHRISTIANS KILLED
 WORLDWIDE FOR FAITH-RELATED
 REASONS, YOU CAN SEE THE
 NUMBERS, THEY ARE STAGGERING,
 BUT 2018 THERE ARE 4,136, SUSAN?
 AN EASTER DAY BOMBING IS
 PRETTY HORRIFIC, IT IS A
 REMINDER THAT EVEN THOUGH ISIS
 HAS LOST ITS TERRITORY, ISIS AND
 SIMILAR RADICAL ISLAMIC GROUPS
 REMAIN A TERRIBLE THREAT.
 AND IT WAS TURNING OUT TO BE
 VERY SOPHISTICATED BOMBS, THEY
 MANAGED ALL OF THE HAVOC WITH
 SEVEN SUICIDE BOMBERS.
 IN SOME HELP FROM INTERNATIONAL
 TERRORIST GROUPS.
 SPEAK OF THOSE ARE THE TWO BIG
 THINGS TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT,
 THE OBVIOUS COORDINATION,
 SEVERAL BOMBS ON OPPOSITE SIDES
 OF THE COUNTRY GOING OFF
 SIMULTANEOUSLY, AND THE FACT
 THAT THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES
 HAD BEEN WARNED ABOUT THIS QUITA
 WHILE AGO, WHY DID THEY NOT TAKE
 SOME SORT OF ACTION ON THIS?
 Bret: WE WILL CONTINUE TO
 FOLLOW, PANEL, THANK YOU.
 WHEN WE COME BACK, GOOD NEWS
 FROM THE MEN AND WOMEN IN BLUE.

  I don't keep track of regrets.
  And I don't add up the years.
    But what I do count on...
