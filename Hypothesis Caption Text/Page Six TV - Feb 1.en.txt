I'LL EXPLAIN IT ALL RIGHT AFTER CONNECTION. I'LL EXPLAIN IT ALL RIGHT AFTER THIS. A migraine hope To be there... for the good. And not so good. For the mundane. The awe-inspiring. The heart racing. The heart breaking. That's what life is all about... showing up. Unless migraine steals your chance to say I am here. That's why, we created Aimovig.. A preventive treatment for migraine in adults. One dose, once a month. Aimovig is proven to reduce the number of monthly migraine days. For some, that number can be cut in half or more. The most common side effects are pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site and constipation. These are your days What will each one bring? Doesn't matter, as long as you can say... I am here. Talk to your doctor about preventing migraine with Aimovig. And be there more. I switched to stimulant-free MiraLAX for my constipation. <i> Stimulant laxatives</i> <i> forcefully stimulate </i> <i> the nerves in</i> <i> your colon.</i> <i> MiraLAX is</i> <i> different.</i> <i> It works with</i> <i> the water</i> <i> in your body</i> <i> to unblock</i> <i> your system</i> <i> naturally.</i> And it doesn't cause harsh side effects. That's why I choose MiraLAX. <i> Look for the pink cap.</i>
