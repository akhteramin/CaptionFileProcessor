 Announcer: LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY, IT'S
 "THE WENDY WILLIAMS SHOW."

 NOW, HERE'S NICK CANNON! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

 Nick: OH!

 OH, YEAH!
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 YES, YES!
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 WHAT'S UP, Y'ALL?
 THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!
 THANK YOU! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 THANK YOU!
 I DON'T DO IT WELL, I'M GOING TO
 TRY.
 HOW YOU DOIN'?
 Audience: HOW YOU DOIN'?
 Nick: I'M GOING TO WORK ON
 IT.
 GREETINGS, Y'ALL.
 THINK OF HAVING HAVING ME.
 IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT'S A BLESSING.
 I GOT TO SAY IT OFF THE TOP,
 Y'ALL.
 EVERYBODY WANTS TO KNOW.
 I SPOKE TO RANDY.
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 I TALKED TO HER!
 HONESTLY, SHE SOUNDED AMAZING,
 Y'ALL.
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 WE JUMPED ON THE PHONE FOR THE
 FIRST THING SHE SAID WAS, "NICK
 CANNON, HOW YOU DOIN'?
 "HONESTLY, I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO
 EXPECT AT FIRST.
 BUT HER SPIRIT WAS SO BIG.
 IT WAS SO AMAZING.
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 WHAT WAS ALSO AWESOME, I HAD A
 CONVERSATION WITH HER AND HER
 WHOLE FAMILY.
 SHE SAID SHE WANTED TO SPEAK AS
 A FAMILY UNIT.
 I TALKED TO HER, KEVIN, LITTLE
 KEVIN.
 THEY SAID THEY ALL GOOD.
 THE LOVE AND THE PASSION IS
 STILL THERE.
 THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED IN TIMES
 LIKE THIS.
 FOR YOUR FAMILY TO STICK
 TOGETHER WITH YOU.
 HONESTLY, I GOT A LITTLE
 EMOTIONAL.
 IT DID.
 WHEN I SPOKE TO HER, SHE SAID
 SHE FEELS Y'ALL LOVE.
 SHE KNOWS THAT THERE ARE
 PROBABLY A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT
 HAVEN'T BEEN ANSWERED AND STUFF.
 AS SOMEBODY ALSO DEALS WITH AN
 AUTOIMMUNE CONDITION, I'M
 DIAGNOSED WITH LUPUS, AND I KNOW
 THAT WHEN YOU GO THROUGH THESE
 THINGS AND FLARE UP SOME STUFF,
 YOU NEVER KNOW.
 IT'S DAY BY DAY, Y'ALL.
 ONE DAY YOU COULD BE STRONG, AND
 THE NEXT YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF
 BED.
 SHE SOUNDED STRONG PRICK SHE
 WANTED TO
 THANK EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 SHE WAS TEARING UP, SHE SAID
 SOMETHING THAT WAS REALLY
 POWERFUL.
 YOU KNOW ME AND WENDY, WE'VE HAD
 A LOVE-HATE RELATIONSHIP OVER
 THE YEARS!
 IT'S NOTHING BUT LOVE.
 I LOVE MY QUEEN.
 WHEN SHE SAID THIS, SHE SAID
 THERE COULD BE NEGATIVITY OUT
 THERE.
 SHE HEARS THE THINGS, PEOPLE
 TALKING ABOUT HER FAMILY UNIT
 AND ALL THAT AND WHAT'S GOING
 ON.
 SHE WAS LIKE, "YOU KNOW WHAT
 CUSTOMER AGREE TO WANT TO BRING
 THAT NEGATIVE ENERGY WHEN WE ARE
 TRYING TO HEAL."
 [APPLAUSE]
 YOU NEED YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS
 IN MOMENTS LIKE THIS.
 THAT'S WHEN LOVE IS TRULY
 TESTED, WHEN YOU KNOW "I'M GOING
 TO STICK TO THIS REGARDLESS OF
 WHAT'S GOING ON."
 SO I SPOKE TO EVERYBODY AS YOU
 DO AND WE WILL GIVE THE SAME
 TYPE OF LOVE BECAUSE IT'S ALL
 ABOUT THIS UNIT.
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 SHE SAID, SHE SAID, "HAVE FUN,
 BUT DON'T GET TOO COMFORTABLE
 BECAUSE I'M COMING BACK!"
 [LAUGHTER]
 SO I WILL SAY IT LIKE THIS -WE
 WILL TAKE OF THE I OUT OF
 ILLNESS, ADD WE, AND GET
 WELLNESS.
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 I WANT Y'ALL TO SAY IT.
 GO AHEAD, SAY, "WE LOVE YOU,
 WENDY!"
 Audience: WE LOVE YOU,
 WENDY!"
 Nick: THAT'S WHAT I'M
 TALKING ABOUT.
 I SPOKE TO ANOTHER POWERFUL
 WOMAN, MY MAMA.
 I TALKED TO MY MAMA.
 I ALSO TALKED TO MY GRANDMAMMA.
 THEN I TALKED TO MY GREAT GRAND
 MAMA.
 OVER THERE IN NORTH CAROLINA.
 SHE'S 99.
 MS. KAREN CANNON
 SHE SAID, "DON'T GET ON THERE AND BE TOO MESSY, NOW!
 DON'T MAKE YOUR FAMILY LOOK BAD!
 DON'T BE UP THERE BEING MESSY!"
 SO I'M GOING TO TRY TO TAKE MY
 MATRIARCHS ADVICE AND TRY NOT TO
 BE TOO MESSY.
 BUT IT'S TIME FOR "HOT TOPICS."
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

 IT'S GONE DOWN.
 YEAH.
 WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT.
 NOW, DID I GET THE SHOE CAM?
 Y'ALL GOT TO GET THIS!

 WOW!

 STUNTING ON 'EM!
 THAT'S A HOT TOPIC.
 THIS IS WENDY'S THING, THE HOT
 TOPICS.
 WE TALK ABOUT THE GOSSIP AND
 THINGS GOING ON.
 WE'RE GOING TO COVER ALL OF
 THAT.
 I'M A BIT OF A CONSPIRACY
 THEORIST MYSELF.
 I FEEL LIKE A LOT OF THIS GOSSIP
 JUST BE DISTRACTIONS FROM THE
 REAL THINGS GOING ON IN THE
 WORLD.
 COME ON, JESUS!
 COME ON, SOMEBODY!
 [AUDIENCE REACTS]
 IT'S A DISTRACTION!
 SO WE'RE GOING TO COVER THE
 "HOT TOPICS," BUT WE ALSO GOING
 TO TALK ABOUT THE NOT TOPICS!
 NICK'S NOT TOPICS, THE THINGS
 THAT THEY NOT TALKING ABOUT!
 HOW THEY TRYING TO DISTRACT YOU!
 ONE OF THE HOT TOPICS OBVIOUSLY
 IS THAT LAST NIGHT WAS THE
 SUPER BOWL.
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 [BOOING]
 IT WASN'T SO SUPER, I HEARD!
 I DIDN'T WATCH IT.
 AS YOU ALL NO, Y'ALL SAW THE
 HASHTAG, I'M WITH KAEP.
 I ACTUALLY WAS WITH HIM!
 THAT'S ME AND MY MAN!
 THAT'S ME AND COLIN RIGHT THERE,
 TWO BROTHERS TALKING IN THE
 DARK!
 IT WAS GOING DOWN!
 WE WAS HAVING A SECRET MEETING!
 HONESTLY, COLLIN CAP RIDDICK IS
 ONE OF MY CLOSEST FRIENDS OUT
 HERE
 WE DIDN'T EVEN TURN THE TV ON, WE WENT AND GOT SOME CHINESE
 VEGAN FOOD.
 I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE
 DISGUSTING, BUT IT WAS AMAZING!
 A PEACEFUL PROTEST.
 WE DIDN'T WANT NO BEEF.
 [LAUGHTER]
 Audience: WE LOVE THAT!
 Nick: THIS IS MY THING --
 YELLOW, FAMILY, WHERE YOU AT?
 Audience: WE LOVE THAT!
 Nick: HONESTLY, WITH ALL
 THE DRAMA WITH THE SUPER BOWL
 GOING ON, BEING THE WORLD'S
 BIGGEST DISPLAY OF CAPITALISM
 EVER, THAT PEOPLE FORGOT ABOUT
 THE TRUE REASON WHY HE WAS
 PROTESTING.
 IT'S SYSTEMIC OPPRESSION, THAT'S
 ONE OF AMERICA'S BIGGEST
 PROBLEMS.
 THIS MAN PUT $150 MILLION ON THE
 LINE FOR HIS PEOPLE.
 [APPLAUSE]
 UNTIL THIS DAY, I COMMEND HIM.
 I KNOW THE SUPER BOWL IS A BIG
 DEAL.
 ALL THIS STUFF.
 BUT I COMMEND A TRUE SOLDIER, A
 TRUE CAT THAT IS STANDINGG FIRM
 AND ROCKING.
 I HAVE TO SUPPORT MY FRIEND, AND
 I WAS WITH MY FRIEND.
 [APPLAUSE]
 HONESTLY, IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE,
 AGAIN, THOUGH NOT TOPIC A BIT
 ALL THAT EVERYBODY JUST SEEM TO
 HAVE FORGOTTEN.
 IT'S BLACK HISTORY MONTH, Y'ALL!
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 Y'ALL WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE
 SUPER BOWL?
 COLIN KAEPERNICK IS BLACK
 HISTORY!
 BUT TODAY IS ACTUALLY ROSA
 PARKS' BIRTHDAY.
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 SHOUT OUT TO THE QUEEN.
 LAST WEEK, ON JANUARY 31ST,
 JACKIE ROBINSON TURNED 100 YEARS
 OLD!
 I WAS HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH
 COLIN KAEPERNICK LAST NIGHT,
 "YOU ARE REALLY ARE GENERATION'S
 VERSION OF JACKIE ROBERTSON IN A
 WAY, WITH A LITTLE ROSA THROWN
 IN THERE!"
 BECAUSE WHEN YOU THINK OF THE
 SACRIFICE -WE HONOR BUT JACKIE
 ROBINSON OUTCOME BUT IT WAS LIKE
 THE BACK OF THE DAY.
 THEY WERE THREATENING TO CHILL
 JACKIE ROBINSON.
 THERE WERE RACIAL SLURS.
 IF YOU READ THAT AUTOBIOGRAPHY,
 IT'S AMAZING.
 HE SAID THIS, THIS IS THE JACKIE
 ROBINSON QUOTE, "I CANNOT STAND
 AND SING ANTHEM, I CANNOT SALUTE
 THE FLAG.
 I KNOW THAT I AM A BLACK MAN AND
 A WHITE WORLD."
 [APPLAUSE]
 THAT'S JACKIE ROBINSON.
 THAT'S THE SAME THING THAT
 COLIN KAEPERNICK IS SAYING!
 I JUST ENCOURAGE EVERYONE OUT
 THERE, DON'T BE ON THE WRONG
 SIDE OF HISTORY, Y'ALL.
 YOU CAN BELIEVE WHAT YOU WANT TO
 BELIEVE, JACKIE ROBINSON WAS A
 VETERAN.
 I LOVE AND SUPPORT ALL OF OUR
 VETERANS WHO FIGHT FOR OUR
 FREEDOM TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A
 PEACEFUL PROTEST AND NOT GET UP
 THERE AND HAVE TO BE PUNISHED
 BECAUSE YOU ARE PROTESTING
 PEACEFULLY.
 I WANT TO SEE MY MAN
 COLIN KAEPERNICK PLAYING ONE
 MORE TIME.
 WE WORK OUT TOGETHER, AND THE
 MAN'S ARM IS CRAZY.
 IT'S CRAZY!
 SPEAKING FOR THE PEOPLE THAT DID
 WATCH THE SUPER BOWL -I DIDN'T
 WATCH, BUT I HEARD THE HALFTIME
 SHOW WAS SOMETHING THAT WASN'T
 TO WATCH.
 [AUDIENCE REACTS]
 I HEARD IT WAS THE FYRE FESTIVAL
 OF HALFTIME SHOWS!
 [LAUGHTER]
 MAROON 5 PERFORMED.
 SHOUTS OUT TO ADAM LEVINE AND
 EVERYBODY.
 I DIDN'T SEE IT, BUT I HEARD
 THEY HAD AN ALL-WHITE DRUM LINE
 IN ATLANTA?
 DURING BLACK HISTORY MONTH?
 I STARTED "DRUM LINE," I WASN'T
 AVAILABLE.
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 THAT'S BEFORE THE MUSCLES!
 SO, WAIT -Y'ALL COULDN'T FIND
 NO BLACK DRUMMERS IN ATLANTA?
 I GUESS EVERYBODY WAS WITH KAEP.
 OH, THEY GOT ONE BROTHER RIGHT
 THERE.
 WE LOVE EVERYBODY.
 ALL RIGHT.
 THEN -BECAUSE I DIDN'T SEE IT,
 BUT THEN I HEARD OF ALL THE
 TRIBUTES TO MAKE AND TO GET OUT
 THERE, BLACK HISTORY MONTH, THEY
 WERE WAITING FOR THEM TO MAKE A
 STATEMENT, TO HONOR SOMEBODY,
 AND HE HONORS SPONGEBOB.
 [AUDIENCE REACTS]
 SHOUTS OUT TO MY NICKELODEON
 FAMILY, I LOVE SPONGEBOB!
 BUT I DIDN'T KNOW -I HEARD HOW
 IT CAME OUT, I HEARD THAT TRAVIS
 SCOTT SHOT OUT OF SPONGEBOB'S --
 OR SOMETHING?
 IT WAS FIRE, A FIREBALL, TRAVIS
 SCOTT ARRIVED OUT THE BIKINI
 BOTTOM?
 [LAUGHTER]
 I DIDN'T SEE IT.
 THIS IS JUST WHAT I HEARD.
 I HOPE TRAVIS WAS OUT THERE --
 WHAT IS THAT AROUND HIS WAIST?
 HE'S GOT ON A WAIST TRAINER!
 [LAUGHTER]
 THE KARDASHIANS IS GETTING TO
 HIM, BOY!
 I'M TRYING NOT TO BE MESSY.
 I'M SORRY.
 I HEARD HE WAS OUT THERE FOR A
 FEW SECONDS, HE DIDN'T GET TO DO
 THE WHOLE --
 FELL INTO THE AUDIENCE.
 HEY, MORE POWER TO EVERYBODY.
 THE ARTISTS.
 BUT THE NOT TOPIC IS -I
 REALIZED DURING THE SUPER BOWL
 HALFTIME SHOW'S BACK IN THE DAY,
 THEY BANNED JANET JACKSON FOR
 SHOWING ONE NIPPLE, BUT ADAM
 LEVINE WAS OUT THERE WITH ALL
 HIS NIPPLES OUT!
 ALL OF THEM!
 HE'S GOT THE TRIPLE NIPPLE!
 WHAT IS THIS?
 THAT'S A DOUBLE STANDARD, NFL!
 JANET CAN'T HAVE ONE COMPANY CAN
 HAVE THREE OF HIS OUT?
 JUST SAYING, BROWN NIPPLES
 MATTER.
 THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.
 [APPLAUSE]
 ATLANTA WAS HOT THIS WEEKEND, WE
 AGREE TO KEEP GOING, I'M TRYING
 NOT TO BE MESSY, Y'ALL.
 I'M TRYING.
 [LAUGHS]
 SPEAKING OF ATLANTA, A SERIOUS
 NOTE -A LOVE GOT TO SAY IS 321
 SAVAGE.
 [APPLAUSE]
 HE WAS ARRESTED IN ATLANTA BY
 ICE.
 I DON'T MESS WITH THEM,
 ESPECIALLY THE BLACK ICE.
 THEY WILL CATCH YOU SLIPPING
 EVERY TIME.
 WHAT DOES IT STAND FOR?
 IMMIGRATION CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT
 OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
 WE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT 21
 SAVAGE.
 I DON'T KNOW WHY I SO WANTED TO
 MESS WITH 21, BUT APPARENTLY
 HE'S BRITISH!
 [AUDIENCE REACTS]
 SHOUTS OUT TO THE BRITISH ROW
 OVER THERE!
 21 SAVAGE'S REAL NAME -HELLO.
 HELLO, 21.
 APPARENTLY, THE REASON WHY THEY
 BOTHER HIM BACK IN 2005, HE CAME
 HERE AT 13 YEARS OLD.
 LEGALLY.
 AND HE NEVER RENEWED HIS VISA.
 [AUDIENCE REACTS]
 YOU FORGET!
 THERE'S A LOT ON HIS MIND AT
 THAT AGE!
 13-YEAR-OLD SAVAGE GOT A LOT OF
 STUFF TO THINK ABOUT!
 HE ATE ALWAYS GOT TIME TO -A T
 OF PEOPLE WHERE IT RESTED IN
 ATLANTA THIS WEEKEND.
 BOW WOW.
 NO!
 TAKE IT AWAY!
 WERE NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT
 THAT!
 HE'S MY FRIEND.
 SO IS THE WILD TO WILDIN' OUT
 GIRL.
 WE'RE GOING TO GET OUT THE
 DETAILS AND SPEAK TO BOTH OF
 THEM.
 BOW WOW, CALL ME!
 [APPLAUSE]
 I TOLD YOU ABOUT THOSE GIRLS,
 YOU DON'T KNOW THERE AND INTO
 FORCE!
 THEY GET DOWN!
 WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT TOMORRO
 TOMORROW.
 BOW OUT AS A FRIEND OF MINE.
 HOPEFULLY I CAN CHOP IT UP WITH
 THEM AND GET THE REAL STORY.
 THERE IS NOTHING FUNNY ABOUT
 DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ON EITHER
 SIDE.
 BUT WE WILL GET TO IT.
 BACK TO 21 SAVAGE.
 ALSO, THERE'S NOTHING FUNNY
 ABOUT A YOUNG MAN FROM OUR
 COMMUNITY GETTING INCARCERATED.
 THAT'S NOT FUNNY, EITHER.
 I KNOW 21, HE'S A GOOD GUY.
 HE STARTED A FINANCIAL LITERACY
 CAMPAIGN FOR HIS COMMUNITY.
 HE KEEPS SCHOOL SUPPLIES TO OVER
 2,000 STUDENTS OUT THERE.
 HE DOES GOOD FOR THE COMMUNITY.
 LIKE I SAID, FREE 21.
 THIS IS A SERIOUS MATTER.
 THEIR PEOPLE ONLINE TALKING
 ABOUT IT AND JOKING ABOUT.
 THE FAMILY CAME OUT IT THE HARD
 WAY.
 DEMI LOVATO FOUND THAT OUT.
 SHE TWEETED THIS LAST NIGHT, SHE
 SAID, "SO FAR 21 SAVAGE MEANS
 HAVE BEEN MY FAVORITE PART OF
 THE SUPER BOWL."
 THE KEY MATTER, Y'ALL.
 THEY GOT TO ROOSTING QUICKLY.
 SOMEBODY LIKE HER WHO HAS BEEN
 THROUGH A LOT OF HARD TIMES AND
 SUFFERED SOME ADVERSITIES AND
 THINGS OF THAT NATURE, SHE
 SHOULD HAVE PROBABLY KNEW THAT
 OTHER PEOPLE'S DOWNFALLS AND
 ISSUES AREN'T REALLY FUNNY.
 THE FAMILY LET HER KNOW.
 THEY DEFINITELY LET HER KNOW.
 SHE QUIT TWITTER, SHE QUIT
 INSTAGRAM, SHE QUIT BLACKPLANET,
 AMAZON...
 [LAUGHTER]
 SHE QUIT IT ALL.
 I THINK SHE EVEN QUIT CHRISTIAN
 MINGLE.
 SHE SAYS SHE DON'T WANT NO PARTS
 OF THE INTERNET.
 BUT, DEMI, CALL ME.
 I'LL GET THEM OFF YOU.
 I WILL CALL THE FAMILY OFF.
 [APPLAUSE]
 THE FAMILY DON'T PLAY THAT, WHEN
 YOU TALK ABOUT ONE OF US.
 WE'VE GOT PROBLEMS.
 SO HIT ME UP.
 THIS JUST IN -THEY DONE FOUND
 THE CULPRIT WHO SNITCHED ON 21
 SAVAGE!
 IT'S TEKASHI 6IX9INE!
 YOU TELLING ON EVERYBODY!
 [LAUGHTER]
 JA RULE, WATCH OUT!
 HE SNITCHING ON ALL THE RAPPERS!
 [LAUGHTER]
 FOR THOSE OF YOU DON'T KNOW WHO
 TEKASHI IS, HE'S A VERY COLORFUL
 WRAPPER.
 TATTOOS, RAINBOW HAIR, ALL THAT.
 TEKASHI THOUGHT HE WAS ABOUT
 THAT LIFE.
 APPARENTLY HE'S REALLY NOT.
 HE PLED GUILTY TO NINE CHARGES
 AFTER SNITCHING ON ALL OF HIS
 CREW MEMBERS.
 HE USED TO COME OUT AND DO
 INTERVIEWS, "I'M NEVER GOING TO
 JAIL!"
 ALL THAT.
 HE WOULD DO ALL OF THE STUFF.
 BUT APPARENTLY, MAN, I DON'T
 KNOW WHAT TO SAY IN THE
 SITUATION LIKE THAT.
 IT'S UNFORTUNATE.
 I DON'T WISH PRISON ON ANYONE.
 BUT, YOU KNOW HE WAS ALWAYS
 TALKING ABOUT IT.
 SAYING HOMOPHOBIC SLAYERS,
 "YOU'RE GOING TO DO THIS TO ME,"
 BUT NOW YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN
 PRISON AND YOU WILL FIND ALL
 THAT OUT!
 THEY WILL PUT YOU TO THE TEST!
 [APPLAUSE]
 THE NOT TOPIC ABOUT THIS ONE, I
 THINK IT'S REPORTEDLY 47 YEARS?
 HOLD UP.
 I'M NOT THE GREATEST
 MATHEMATICIAN IN THE WORLD, BUT
 47 YEARS, AND HE IS 22 YEARS
 OLD...
 THAT MEANS IT'S ACTUALLY --
 TEKASHI WILL GET OUT OF PRISON
 WHEN HE IS 69!
 [LAUGHTER]
 MAY BE YOUR NAME SHOULD HAVE
 BEEN TEKASHI TWO AND A HALF!
 YOU KEEP SNITCHING ON PEOPLE,
 IT'S GOING TO BE TEKASHI FIVE TO
 SEVEN.
 AGAIN, WE CAN DO IS SEND OUR
 PRAYERS.
 THIS IS AN UNFORTUNATE
 SITUATION.
 LET THIS BE A LESSON TO ALL THE
 YOUNG PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO
 GLAMORIZE AND ADMIRE GANG
 VIOLENCE IN ANY TYPE OF
 VIOLENCE.
 IF YOU AIN'T REALLY ABOUT IT,
 IT'S NOTHING TO PLAY WITH,
 Y'ALL.
 THIS IS PEOPLE'S REAL LIVES.
 [APPLAUSE]
 OTHER BIG NEWS THIS WEEKEND --
 [LAUGHS]
 SHOUTS OUT TO MY GUY, PETE
 DAVIDSON, Y'ALL.
 25 YEARS OLD, HAS MOVED ON FROM
 ARIANA GRANDE TO 45-YEAR-OLD
 KATE BECKINSALE!
 [APPLAUSE]
 MAKING ME PROUD!
 MAKE ME PROUD, PETE!
 I DON'T KNOW IF YOU ALL KNOW
 THIS, BUT PETE IS LITERALLY MY
 LITTLE BROTHER.
 I'LL TELL YOU A STORY -I USED
 TO DO MORNINGS HERE IN
 NEW YORK CITY.
 EVERY MORNING ON MY RADIO SHOW,
 A 15-YEAR-OLD KID USED TO CALL
 IN AND TELL ME HOW FUNNY HE WAS.
 I THOUGHT, "THIS KID IS
 ANNOYING."
 AND ICE TO DO COMEDY SHOWS
 AROUND THE CITY, THE GOTHAM
 COMEDY CLUB COME ALL THE
 DIFFERENT COMEDY CLUBS OUT
 THERE.
 YOU KNOW WHAT, LITTLE BOY
 CUSTOMER, BUT I WILL PUT YOU ON
 STAGE!
 HE GOT ON STAGE.
 IT WAS THE YOUNG PETE DAVIDSON.
 HE ROCKED IT, Y'ALL.
 I MADE A PROMISE TO HIM.
 I SAID, "YOU BET WILL NOT GO
 BACK AND FINISH HIGH SCHOOL, I
 PROMISE IT WILL TAKE ON THE ROAD
 WITH ME."
 AND I TOOK THEM ALL OF THE
 COUNTRY.
 WE DID MY FIRST STAND-UP SPECIA
 SPECIAL.
 I PUT THEM IN HIS FIRST MOVIE
 CALLED "SCHOOL DANCE."
 THEN I ALSO PUT HIM ON "WILD N'
 OUT," AND THE REST IS HISTORY.
 HE'S ACTUALLY FLYING IN TONIGHT,
 BUT YOU'RE GOING TO DO SOME
 COMEDY AROUND THE SEAT SITE.
 IF YOU SEE IS OUT THERE, WE'RE
 GOING TO GO PULL UP.
 IT'S FUNNY, HE ALWAYS USED TO
 TELL ME, "MAN, I'M FOLLOWING IN
 YOUR FOOTSTEPS."
 AND I SAID, "YOU DEFINITELY ARE,
 DATING ALL THESE COUGARS!"
 IT'S DEFINITELY GOING DOWN.
 [LAUGHTER]
 THE KING OF COUGARS, I HEARD
 LIAM PAYNE AND NAOMI CAMPBELL
 ARE DATING?
 THE NOT TOPIC ABOUT THAT, I
 DIDN'T KNOW NAOMI WAS SINGLE!
 WOULD HAPPEN, NAOMI?
 SHE WAS IN MY TOP THREE, Y'ALL!
 IT WAS MARIAH CAREY -GOT HURT.
 HALLE BERRY, AND NAOMI!
 YOU BETTER TREAT HER RIGHT,
 BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME CHOCOLATE
 WAITING!
 I'M WAITING!
 [LAUGHTER]
 WHERE HAVING GOOD TIME.
 IN ALL SERIOUSNESS COME I WANT
 TO CLOSE ON THIS ONE.
 JUSSIE SMOLLETT SPOKE OUT FOR
 THE FIRST TIME SINCE HIS BRUTAL
 ATTACK.
 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN REALLY NEGATIVE
 SINCE THEY DIDN'T HAVE ALL THE
 INFORMATION OF THE DON'T KNOW
 THE STORY.
 BUT HE WANTED TO CLEAR SOME
 THINGS THAT.
 SO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
 HE GOT TO SPEAK --
 I WAS BRUISED, BUT MY RIBS
 WERE NOT CRACKS.
 THEY WERE NOT BROKEN.
 I WENT TO THE DOCTOR
 IMMEDIATELY.
 I WAS NOT HOSPITALIZED.
 ABOVE ALL, I THOUGHT THE [BLEEP]
 ATTACKER.
 Nick: HE SAID HE'S THE GAY
 TUPAC!
 LET'S FOCUS ON THE RIGHT THING.
 HE SAID HE IS FIGHTING BACK.
 THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING.
 I DON'T CARE WHAT'S ON HIS
 CELL PHONE COME ALL THAT
 INFORMATION.
 THIS MAN PUT HIS LIFE ON THE
 LINE.
 HE'S PRETTY MUCH THE MINOR'S
 CANARY.
 THIS OF THE RAGE IN THE COAL
 MINE, THEY SENT A CANARY INTO
 THE COAL MINE AND THEY GET IN
 THERE TO TEST ALL THE DANGEROUS
 GASES AND STUFF.
 IF THE CANARY DIDN'T COME BACK,
 THEN THE HUMANS WOULD GO DOWN
 THERE.
 SO THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY, THE
 BLACK MUNI, THEY ARE THE
 CANARIES OF OUR TIME IN OUR
 SOCIETY.
 HE PUT HIS LIFE IN THE LINE.
 WE ROCKING WITH YOU.
 WE APPRECIATE THAT STRENGTH,
 MAN.
 WE STAND WITH YOU.

 Cynthia: HE'S A
 SPORTSCASTER PROVED THIS KIND OF
 THE WORLD I'M IN NOW.
 I WAS LIKE, "MIKE IS GOING TO

 SO I SENT THEM A PICTURE, AND
 THE RESPONSE WAS, "WHO IS THIS?
 "Cynthia: "TOM BRADY,
 HELLO!"
 AND HE WAS LIKE, "BABY, THAT'S
 NOT TOM BRADY."
 Nick: ANY POST THIS?
 Cynthia: YES, BECAUSE AT
 THAT POINT I LEFT.
 WHEN I MET NOT TO TOM BRADY --
 [LAUGHS]
 Nick: TOM AND JERRY.
 Cynthia: I DID THE CARPETS
 AT ALL THE PARTIES, AND THEY ASK
 HOW THE SUPER BOWL WAS GOING.
 AND I SAID, "IT'S GREAT, I JUST
 MET TOM BRADY!"
 SO IT CAN'T GET NO BETTER THAN
 THIS!
 Nick: HILARIOUS.
 IT SOUNDS LIKE YOUR MAN, YOUR
 BOYFRIEND, MIKE, IS AN AMAZING
 GUY.
 [APPLAUSE]
 Y'ALL LOOK GOOD TOGETHER!
 STEVE HARVEY SET Y'ALL UP?
 Cynthia: YES, STEVE SET US
 UP.
 HE'S A FRIEND.
 I WENT ON HIS SHOW TO GET A
 LITTLE UPDATE ON THE SINGLE
 LIFE, DATING LIFE.
 I WAS LIKE, "YEAH, I'M OUT OF
 CLEANING UP, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH."
 IT WAS HARD MEETING SOMEONE.
 HE SAID, "I KNOW A LOT OF GUYS
 WHO WOULD GO OUT WITH YOU,
 CYNTHIA."
 AND I SAID, "YOU THINK YOU CAN
 FIND SOMEBODY BETTER THAN I CAN
 CUSTOMER GOATS DO IT."
 I WENT IN WITH AN EXPECTATION.
 AND WHY WHAT MIKE, HE WAS REALLE
 GUY.
 Nick: WOULD YOU EVER GET
 MARRIED AGAIN CUSTOMER GREENERY

  Do you push through migraine?
     Mom, are you OK to play?
 Yeah honey, how about we play...
      princess and pirates?
   Imagine what you can do with   more migraine-free days.
             Arr!
            En garde!
     When you're not fighting     through migraine
    imagine the possibilities.
  Once-monthly Emgality is used  for the prevention
      of migraine in adults.
  It's specifically developed to  help give you
     more migraine-free days.
  With Emgality about 60% of  people had their migraine days
       cut in half or more.
 Do not use if you are allergic to Emgality or its ingredients.
   Emgality may cause allergic   reactions, such as
     itching, rash, hives and     trouble breathing,
 which can happen days after use.
 Call your doctor or get medical help right away
    if you have symptoms of an    allergic reaction.
       The most common side       effects include
    injection site reactions.
   What should we do tomorrow?
 Ask your doctor about Emgality.

        Oh, but seriously,    it's good to be surrounded
      by what matters most --
      a home and auto bundle         from Progressive.

 NAOMI,

         It hasn't always        been easy, has it?

       There have been days    when you doubted yourself.

        And days when you       were ready to quit.

         But you didn't.

  Because you had the courage to venture into something powerful.
            Education.
     If I leave you with just      three words of advice:
     never...stop...growing.
