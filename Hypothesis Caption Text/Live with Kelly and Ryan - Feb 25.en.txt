 DO, WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT AFTER
 OSCAR SHOW THAT YOU LOVE.
 I CAN'T DO THAT, I'VE BEEN UP

 ME, THAT'S ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DO.

 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 Ryan: GOOD MORNING,
 THANK YOU.
 Kelly: ALL UP THERE.
 IT'S SO NICE.
 THANK YOU.
 THAT'S VERY KIND.
 Ryan: WELCOME.
 IT IS MONDAY, FOR BERRY 25TH,
 2019 LIVE FROM THE DOLBY THEATRE
 STAGE WHERE THE OSCARS TOOK
 PLACE LAST NIGHT.
 Kelly: RIGHT ON THIS VERY
 STAGE.
 Ryan: IN WATCHING THAT
 PIECE YOU JUST SAW EVEN LAST
 NIGHT WHEN LADY GAGA WAS SINGING
 IT, I SAW YOUR FACE.
 Kelly: I AM SORRY ABOUT
 THAT.
 I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE TO
 LADY GAGA FOR ANY HARM I MAY
 HAVE CAUSED HER CAREER.
 Ryan: YOU WERE REMARKABLE.
 Kelly: WHAT'S SO FUNNY IS
 NOW I THINK I SOUND LIKE THAT.
 Ryan: AND I THINK I LOOK
 LIKE BRADLEY COOPER.
 WE WHEN WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT
 YOU KIND OF DO.
 Ryan: I LOOK LIKE THE
 CAVEMAN FROM THE GEICO
 COMMERCIAL WITH MY BEARD.
 IT WAS A VERY FAKE BEARD.
 Kelly: I DON'T THINK SO, I
 THINK YOU ROCKED IT AND EVEN
 THOUGH THEY DID NOT USE RYAN'S
 SINGING IN THE PIECE, YOU'RE A
 REALLY GOOD SINGER AND I JUST
 WANT TO PUT THAT OUT THERE.
 Ryan: THAT WASN'T MY
 SINGING?
 YOU TOLD ME THAT WAS MY SINGING.
 Kelly: HE IS NERVOUS, OKAY?
 SO THERE WERE SO MANY AMAZING
 MOMENTS LAST NIGHT.
 WONDER FOR SURE, EVERYBODY STOP
 AT THE PERFORMANCE, THE OPENING
 PERFORMANCE BY QUEEN.
 AM I RIGHT?
 Ryan: I LOVED THAT THE SHOW
 STARTED IMMEDIATELY WITH A
 PERFORMANCE.
 TAKE A LOOK.
 ♪♪ WE WILL, WE WILL ROCK YOU ♪
 ♪ WE WILL, WE WILL ROCK YOU ♪
 ♪ WE WILL, WE WILL ROCK YOU ♪♪
 Kelly: YOU KNOW WHAT'S
 INTERESTING?
 COULDN'T YOU TELL WHO WAS A
 NOMINEE AND HE WAS JUST THERE TO
 HAVE FUN JUST BY LOOKING?
 SOME PEOPLE WERE WALKING OUT AND
 SOME PEOPLE WERE LIKE OKAY.
 I'M NERVOUS.
 Ryan: I TALKED TO ADAM
 BEFORE THE SHOW ON THE
 RED CARPET, AND HE WAS SO
 EXCITED TO BE DOING THAT AND HE
 SAID IT'S REALLY COOL TO SEE HER
 FOR THE FIRST TIME, I GOT
 INVITED TO EVERY SINGLE PARTY.
 THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU
 OPEN THE OSCARS.
 AND HOW ABOUT THAT PERFORMANCE
 BY OSCAR-WINNER LADY GAGA AND
 BRADLEY COOPER, THEY WERE
 FANTASTIC.

 ♪♪ I'M OFF THE DEEP END, WATCH
 AS I DAVID ♪
 ♪ CRASHED THROUGH THE SURFACE,
 WHERE THEY CAN'T HURT US ♪
 ♪ WE ARE FAR FROM THE SHALLOW
 NOW ♪♪
 Ryan: I JUST WANT TO TAKE
 ANOTHER LOOK AT YOU.
 THAT WAS AN INTIMATE PERFORMANC
 PERFORMANCE.
 Kelly: IT LOT OF CHATTER.
 Ryan: I WAS TOLD THAT
 BRADLEY CHOREOGRAPHED THAT.
 THAT WAS HIS DESIGN TO GET UP
 AND COME OUT OF THE AUDIENCE AND
 COME AROUND AND SIT NEXT TO HER.
 Kelly: NO KIDDING.
 I WOULD HAVE SAID YOU KNOW HOW
 HARD IT IS TO WALK IN HEELS AND
 A BALL GOWN UPSTAGE?
 SHE SAID OKAY, LET'S DO IT.
 Ryan: AND PLAYED AND SANG.
 IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE I WAS INSIDE
 RIGHT HERE RIGHT AT THE TOP OF
 THE SHOW AND I DIDN'T HAVE A
 TICKET, SO AS SOON AS I SAID
 QUEEN IS COMING UP NEXT.
 THEY SAID WE WILL ESCORT YOU OU
 OUT.
 SO I GET IN THE CAR AND I'M
 LEAVING AND IT'S ONE MINUTE
 AFTER THE TOP OF THE HOUR AND MY
 WINDOW IS DOWN AND THERE IS
 L.A.P.D. OFFICERS ON THE CORNER
 AND THEY SAY HEY, WE WATCH YOU
 AND KELLY, WE'LL SEE YOU IN THE
 MORNING.
 YOU'RE GOING THE WRONG WAY.
 THE OSCARS ARE THAT WAY.
 I SAID I'M GOING HOME BECAUSE I
 ORDERED ENCHILADAS ON POST MATES
 AND MY FAVORITE PIZZA.
 STAY WHEN HE DID ORDER
 ENCHILADAS ON POST MATES.
 Ryan: I WATCH AT HOME LIKE
 EVERYBODY ELSE WITH ENCHILADAS
 AND PIZZA.
 WE WENT I WATCHED THE BACKS OF A
 GROUP OF PRODUCERS HEADS IN
 FRONT OF THE TELEVISION SO TRULS
 CAME AROUND THE CORNER, I HAD
 NO IDEA WHO WAS COMING AROUND
 THE CORNER.
 IT WAS LIKE A SURPRISE TO ME
 BECAUSE I GOT TO SEE VERY
 LITTLE.
 SO I ALWAYS SEE THE MOST OF THE
 ACADEMY AWARDS WHEN WE DO THIS
 SHOW HERE BECAUSE WE SHOW CLIPS
 FROM THE ACADEMY AWARDS.
 Ryan: YOU AND MARK LAST
 NIGHT LOOKED OUTSTANDING ON THE
 CARPET, I JUST WANT TO SAY.
 AND I KNOW I SAY THAT'S ALL THE
 TIME, I LOVE TO SEE YOU BOTH
 TOGETHER AND I LOVE YOUR
 HAPPINESS TOGETHER.
 Kelly: WE HAVE A LOT OF FUN
 TOGETHER AND HE WAS REALLY FUNNY
 BECAUSE I JUST TOLD HIM WE WERE
 GOING, JUST GOING TO RUN OUT
 REAL QUICK AND TALK TO RYAN REAL
 QUICK BECAUSE HE AND I ARE
 BOTH -WE ARE NOT BIG
 RED CARPET PEOPLE.
 IT MAKES US UNCOMFORTABLE TO
 HAVE OUR PICTURES TAKEN IN
 GENERAL AND I KNOW WE WENT TO
 THE WRONG BUSINESS, BUT STILL.
 SO WE HAVE TO RUN DOWN TO RYAN
 BUT DIDN'T SAY WE ARE IN A
 DIFFERENT POSITION THIS YEAR SO
 WE HAD TO RUN DOWN PAST THE
 PHOTOGRAPHERS AND SO WE ARE
 WALKING AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE
 TURNS AROUND AND LOOKS AT ME AND
 GOES A BOY, IT'S A LOT FARTHER
 THIS YEAR, ISN'T IT?
 IT'S A LOT FARTHER.
 AND WE WALK OUT AND THERE WERE
 PHOTOGRAPHERS THERE.
 WHAT PART IS THIS?
 RYAN IS JUST ON THE OTHER SIDE.
 Ryan: JUST 100 YARDS AWAY.
 FOR THE LAST 14 YEARS, I'VE BEEN
 ON THE RED CARPET SHOW ASKING

 Kelly: THANK YOU SO MUCH, I
 APPRECIATE IT.

 SNIFF.
 IT IS SENT FREE, BUT THERE WERE
 40,000 RED ROSES FROM ECUADOR
 ONSET.
 THEY DEHYDRATED THEM WITH THIS
 PROCESS, THEY REMOVE ALL OF THE
 MOISTURE AND WATER OUT OF THEM
 AND THEN THEY REHYDRATE THEM
 WITH SOME SORT OF SPECIAL OIL
 WAS IN THE THESE WILL LIVE FOR A
 YEAR.

 THESE FOR NEXT YEAR.

 UNTIL THE LAST ONE.
 Ryan: IT'S EARLY.
 WE WENT LAST NIGHT, THE OSCARS
 WAS FULL OF SURPRISES OF COURSE.
 LAUGHS, TEARS, THERE WERE HUGE
 WINNERS, AND THEN WHEN THE BIG
 MOMENT HAPPENED, I WAS LUCKY
 ENOUGH TO BE BACKSTAGE WITH THEM
 TO HELP THEM CELEBRATE.
 TAKE A LITTLE LOOK.
 HERE WE ARE BACKSTAGE AT THE
 OSCARS OR LIKE THEY SAY IN
 HOLLYWOOD, LIGHTS, CAMERA,
 LIQUORISH.
 ON THE OSCAR GOES TO
 REGINA KING.
 HE WENT OH, MY GOSH, LOOK WHO'S
 HERE.
 YOU JUST HOSTED THE
 ACADEMY AWARDS.
 I JUST WANT TO SAY ONE THING, DO
 YOU REMEMBER WE HAD A
 CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS MOMENT
 ON OUR SHOW.
 AND I KNOW IT'S YOUR FIRST
 NOMINATION WHICH I CANNOT
 BELIEVE, BUT I'M NOT SURPRISED
 THAT YOUR FIRST NOMINATION
 RESULTED IN YOUR FIRST WIN.
 HOW DOES IT FEEL?
 I AM VIBRATING RIGHT NOW.
 TO HAVE THESE THREE WOMEN, OH,
 MY GOD.
 THAT WAS A HUGE DEAL.
 AND WHAT EVEN MORE AMAZING IS
 THIS MORNING, I GET THESE EMAILS
 OF QUOTES AND I GOT A QUOTE FROM
 AMY POEHLER THIS MORNING THAT
 WAS A QUOTE THIS MORNING AND SO
 WHEN SHE WALKED OUT, I WAS LIKE
 IS THIS A SIGN?
 IS THIS A SIGN TO?
 AND THE QUOTE WAS SURROUND
 YOURSELF WITH PEOPLE THAT
 CHALLENGE YOU AND THAT INSPIRE
 YOU AND I FEEL LIKE I SUBSCRIBE
 TO THAT.
 Kelly: WHAT DOES IT FEEL
 LIKE?
 IT'S HEAVY.
 Kelly: YOU WANT ME TO HOLD
 IT FOR YOU WHILE YOU WATCH THE
 REST OF THE SHOW?
 HI, HOW ARE YOU?
 YOU LOOK REALLY PRETTY OUT
 THERE.
 I TOLD YOU, HE IS WEARING A
 SCRUNCHY.
 WHO ELSE ARE YOU EXCITED ABOUT
 TONIGHT?
 TO MAKE EVERYONE.
 Kelly: SPEAKING OF
 DRINKING, WOULD YOU LIKE TO
 DRINK SOMETHING WHILE YOU'RE
 HERE?
 YOU WANT A LITTLE LIME?
 IT'S GOOD WHATEVER.
 Kelly: DO YOU NEED MORE
 THAN THAT BECAUSE YOUR LARGER?
 ARE YOU SURE?
 COULD SNEAK THOSE LITTLE ONES
 AND THERE.
 IT WASN'T ME, IT WAS KELLY AND
 RYAN.
 Kelly: WHAT WAS THE IDEA
 BEHIND YOUR DESIGNS TONIGHT?
 WHAT WAS YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS?
 I THINK WE WERE BOTH THINKING
 SUBTLETY.
 Kelly: THAT'S WHAT'S SO
 DIFFERENT ABOUT EACH OF YOU.
 HOW DID I NOT KNOW THAT YOU HAD
 SO MANY RABBITS.
 THERE ARE SO MANY RABBITS.
 Kelly: DO YOU FEEL THAT
 GLENN CLOSE MIGHT GET TRIGGERED
 WHEN SHE SEES THIS?
 THERE'S A DOUBLE ENTENDRE.
 AND THE OSCAR GOES TO
 MAHERSHALA ALI.
 Kelly: TWO WINS, YOU HAVE
 THE MAGIC TOUCH FOR SURE.
 I'VE BEEN VERY FORTUNATE.
 Kelly: I LOVE THIS MOVIE
 AND I HAD SUCH GOOD FEELINGS AND
 HIGH HOPES.
 I WAS REALLY VERY HOPEFUL THAT
 YOU WOULD WIN AGAIN AND I'M SO
 HAPPY.
 THANK YOU, I'M PROUD TO BE A
 PART OF IT.
 Kelly: I WANT TO KNOW, WHAT
 WOULD MY DSA AT THE OSCARS?
 MY FEET HURT.
 AND IS THAT CHAMPAGNE?
 Kelly: I WAS CURIOUS IF YOU
 WOULD CONSIDER PLAYING A GAME
 WITH ME?
 HE MET THE PENS WITH THE GAME
 IS.
 Kelly: FIRST CONCERT.
 NOT VAN MORRISON.
 WAIT, MIGHT'VE BEEN ONE THAT I
 SNUCK INTO.
 I THINK JAMES TAYLOR.
 Kelly: HE WATCHES THE SHOW
 EVERY DAY.
 I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER
 THIS, MICHELLE, YOU ARE NOT
 THERE.
 WE WERE IN A JAY-Z VIDEO
 TOGETHER.
 WHICH ONE?
 THIS IS LIKE THE HOW MANY THINGS
 CAN WE NAME.
 Kelly: LET ME REMEMBER
 BECAUSE I'VE BEEN IN SO MANY
 JAY-Z VIDEOS.
 LET ME THINK ABOUT IT.
 CHANGE CLOTHES.
 OBVIOUSLY, IT MEANT MORE TO ME
 THEN TO YOU, BUT THAT'S OKAY.
 I ACTUALLY REMEMBER NOW.
 Kelly: CAN WE SEE THE
 ENVELOPE?
 YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHO IT IS.
 ASK ME WHEN I WAS TO SAY.
 YOU'RE REALLY GOOD, RUNNING
 CIRCLES AROUND ME.
 Kelly: STAY IN YOUR LANE
 AND I'LL STAY IN MINE.
 IT'S WORKING OUT FOR YOU, IT
 REALLY IS.
 DO YOU EVER THINK ABOUT BECOMING
 A DOCTOR?
 IN ACTION HERO.
 I CAN RUN, I CAN JUMP, I CAN
 FIGHT.
 WHEN YOU FIT INTO ALL OF IT, I
 THINK.
 AND THE OSCAR GOES TO...
 SPIKE LEE!
 WE WENT OH, MY GOSH, I'M SO
 HAPPY FOR YOU.
 I AM TRULY HAPPY FOR YOU AND I
 HOPE YOU KNOW THE WHOLE ROOM WAS
 REALLY HAPPY FOR YOU.
 I FELT THE LOVE.
 Kelly: DID YOU KNOW THE
 NEXT WON?
 WE ARE TRYING TO LOSE.
 Kelly: IT WAS GREAT TO SEE
 SPIKE WIN, IT WAS HUGE.
 IT WAS A GREAT MOMENT, DON'T YOU
 THINK?
 YOU ARE A FILM ICON AND NOW YOU
 ARE RICH.
 MY WIFE IS RICH.
 Kelly: THAT'S OKAY.
 SHE HAD GOOD GARTER OF THE
 MONEY?
 SHE'S KILLING IT.
 PEOPLE SAY TO ME WHAT'S IN YOUR
 WALLET?
 MY WIFE'S NAME.
 DEEP IN MY POCKET.

 Kelly: TEACH ME A MOVIE
 PUNCH BECAUSE I WOULD REALLY
 LOVE TO MOVIE PUNCH GELMAN.
 DEPENDS ON WHERE THE CAMERA
 IS.
 SO I'M GOING TO COME FROM THIS
 WAY AND YOU GO THAT WAY.
 SLOW MOTION.
 I CONTACT IS VERY IMPORTANT.
 SO COME HERE.
 Kelly: AND I HAVE TO SELL
 IT, RIGHT?
 NO, YOU'RE A WOMAN, NO,
 NEVER.
 WHEN YOU ARE HITTING GELMAN.
 IN THAT CASE, LET'S DO THIS.
 WHEN YOU REALLY HAVE TO SELL IT.
 I CONTACT.
 YEAH.
 WE CAME, WE SAW, WE CELEBRATED
 IT.
 I DON'T THINK THAT'S HOW THEY
 WOULD TOWN WILL EVER BE THE SAM
 SAME.
 I MISSED IT.
 Announcer: NEXT, BEST ACTOR
 OSCAR WINNER RAMI MALEK.
         DEAREST BRITAIN.
           WE LOVE YOU.
   MAYBE IT'S YOUR BIG HEARTS.
       YOUR SENSE OF STYLE.
        WELCOME TO BA100.
             (BA100,   YOU'RE CLEAR FOR TAKE-OFF).
  HOW YOU FOLLOW YOUR OWN PATH.
    YOU'VE LED REVOLUTIONS...
          OF ALL KINDS.
  YET YOU WON'T SHOUT ABOUT IT.
  IT'S JUST NOT IN YOUR NATURE.
         INSTEAD, YOU'LL      QUIETLY MAKE HISTORY.
              CAKE.
              BEDS.
             POETRY.
             TROUBLE.
           LOVE! HOPE!
     AND RATHER A LOT OF TEA.
       THE BEST OF BRITAIN,
         FROM THE MOMENT        YOU STEP ON BOARD.
 Ryan: WE ARE BACK LIVE AT THE DOLBY.
 SO CLARK GABLE, LAURENCE OLIVIE
 OLIVIER, JACK NICHOLSON, DENZEL
 WASHINGTON, TOM HANKS, ALL
 INCREDIBLE ACTORS, ALL
 INCREDIBLE OSCAR WINNERS.
 LAST NIGHT, A NEW NAME WAS ADDED
 TO THAT LIST OF TALENTED MEN,
 RAMI MALEK.
 SO TERRIFIC AS AN ACTOR AND A
 GREAT GUY.
 WATCH THIS.

 THE OSCAR GOES TO RAMI MALEK.
 Kelly: I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU
 YOU.
 I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER.
 YOU CAN'T BE HAPPIER THAN ME.
 WE WENT I'M SURE YOU'RE THE
 HAPPIEST BUT WE ARE ALL THE
 SECOND HAPPIEST.
 WE WATCH THIS MOVIE AND I FELT
 LIKE I WAS WATCHING A
 DOCUMENTARY, AND I KNOW YOU.
 YOU'VE BEEN ON THE SHOW.
 WE LOVE HAVING YOU ON OUR SHOW.
 AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU AS I WAS
 WATCHING YOU GIVE YOUR SPEECH,
 IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL AND I DON'T
 KNOW IF YOU NOTICED, BUT THEY
 FOUND YOUR MOM.
 THEY FOUND YOUR MOM IN THE
 AUDIENCE.
 Rami: OH, MY GOD, .
 MY MOM IS IN HERE SOMEWHERE.
 I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU, LADY.
 MY FAMILY, THANK YOU FOR ALL OF
 THIS.
 I NEVER TALK ABOUT PERSONAL
 STUFF.
 I WILL SAY THIS TODAY.
 MY MOM WAS PREGNANT WITH MY
 BROTHER AND I, I'M A TWIN AND AS
 A KID, SHE TOOK THREE BUSES TO
 GET TO WORK, THREE DIFFERENT
 BUSES SO THAT SHE COULD
 EVENTUALLY GIVE US A BETTER LIFE
 WITH MY DAD AND THEY WORKED SO
 HARD TO TELL US TO DO SOMETHING
 SPECIAL, BE SOMETHING SPECIAL NO
 MATTER WHAT IT WAS, SO TO SHARE
 THIS WITH HER WAS THE GREATEST
 MOMENT I COULD HAVE ASKED FOR.
 I'VE GOT TO SAY, SOMEHOW THE WAY
 SHE RAISED ME INTRODUCED ME TO
 SOME GOOD PEOPLE AND I DIDN'T
 WANT TO GIVE A LIST OF NAMES OUT
 THERE BUT THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE
 SUPPORTED ME, THEY ARE RIGHT
 HERE BEHIND THIS CAMERA, THERE
 IS AN AGENT THAT'S BEEN WITH ME
 FOR SO LONG AS AN ACTOR WHO IS
 RIGHT THERE.
 TO BE WHERE IS DOUG?
 COME HERE.
 IF JUST FOR A SECOND.
 WHAT AN AGENT.
 Rami: THAT IS BEN CURTIS
 THAT YOU JUST SAW.
 CYNTHIA PATTON.
 AND DAVID WEBER, THESE GUYS, WE
 DON'T GET TO DO THIS WITHOUT AN
 ARMY BEHIND US.
 WE ARE SO PRIVILEGED AND SO
 LUCKY SO IT'S ONE TYPE OF
 FAMILY, IT'S ANOTHER TYPE OF
 FAMILY, AND I'VE BEEN THINKING
 FREDDIE MERCURY THROUGHOUT THIS
 PROCESS.
 I WANTED TO THANK QUEEN BECAUSE
 JUST AN INTEGRAL PART OF THAT
 BAND.
 I AM NOT THE LEAD SINGER.
 I AM NOT THE LEADER OF THE BAND,
 JUST THE LEAD SINGER AND I
 THOUGHT THAT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL
 THAT HE COULD MAKE IT SO
 COLLABORATIVE, BUT RIGHT NOW I
 WILL GIVE IT TO YOU, MY MAN.
 I MAY NOT HAVE BEEN THE OBVIOUS
 CHOICE, BUT I GUESS IT WORKED
 OUT.
 Kelly: THIS IS YOUR FIRST
 OSCAR NOMINATION, YOUR FIRST
 WHEN, WHEN THEY CALLED YOUR
 NAME, TAKE ME INTO YOUR BRAIN.
 WHAT WAS THE FIRST THING THAT
 POPPED INTO YOUR BRAIN?
 THE VERY FIRST THOUGHT, IF YOU
 CAN REMEMBER.
 Rami: I'LL TELL YOU THIS.
 I START RUNNING EVERYBODY ELSE'S
 NAME THAT'S NOMINATED IN MY HEAD
 SO I CAN JUST ANTICIPATE THAT
 THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
 SO I'M GOING TO BRADLEY,
 CHRISTIAN, WILLEM AND I JUST
 KEEP REPEATING THEM OVER AND
 OVER AGAIN.
 I JUST KNOW I'M GOING TO CLAP
 FOR ANYONE BECAUSE I THINK I WAS
 PART OF A GROUP OF ACTORS THAT
 I'VE ADMIRED FOR SO MANY YEARS.
 THOSE GUYS ALL DESERVE TO WIN
 AND WHEN IT HITS YOU THAT SEE IS
 YOU, YOU MUSTER UP THE ENERGY TO
 PUT A COHESIVE SENTENCE AND THE
 FIRST THING TO COME TO YOUR MIND
 IS THANK MOM, I THINK THE PEOPLE
 WHO HELPED GET YOU HERE AND JUST
 SPEAK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT MEANS
 SO MUCH TO YOU.
 PART OF MY STORY IS BEING
 WRITTEN RIGHT NOW, AND I COULD
 NOT BE MORE GRATEFUL TO EACH AND
 EVERY ONE OF YOU AND EVERYONE
 WHO BELIEVED IN ME FOR THIS
 MOMENT.
 IT IS SOMETHING I WILL TREASURE
 FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.
 JUST GIVE IT YOUR ALL, SO
 THANK YOU FOR ALWAYS HAVING MY
 BACK.
 Kelly: ALWAYS, THANK YOU.
 Rami: I AM BLESSED, I COULD
 NOT BE MORE THANKFUL.
 Kelly: YOU DESERVE IT.
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
 Announcer: UP NEXT,
 BEBE REXHA DEBUTS HER NEW SONG.
 LIFE HAS PARTNERED WITH NATIVE
 FOR THE PREDICT THE WINNER'S
 BALLOT CONTEST.
 TUNE IN THIS WEEK WHEN WE REVEAL
 THE GRAND PRIZE WINNER.
 DON'T SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF WITH
 THE NATIVE DEODORANT.
         [music playing]         Psst. Hey, you!
  The one with the designer dog  collar.
 Wondering how I upgraded to this sweet pad?
  A 1,200-square-foot bathroom,  and my very own spa.
   All I had to do was give my   human “the look”.
   With Wells Fargo's 3% down   payment on a fixed-rate loan
       and a simpler online       application,
  getting into my dream home was  easier than ever.
     Get your human to visit     wellsfargo.com/woof.
  What would she do without me?
 Ryan: BEBE REXHA IS A GRAMMY NOMINATED SINGER AND
 SONGWRITER, THIS IS HER
 TELEVISION DEBUT OF HER NEW HIT

 Kelly: WHAT WERE THE BEST
 MOMENTS?
 THE BIGGEST MOMENT I THOUGHT
 WAS WHEN GLENN CLOSE DID NOT WIN
 FOR BEST ACTRESS.
 EVERYBODY SAID, IT WAS LIKE WHEN
 LA-LA LAND ONE, BUT DIDN'T WIN.
 IT WAS A REAL SHOCK.
 BUT THEN OLIVIA COLMAN WON.
 AND SHE GAVE ONE OF THE BEST
 SPEECHES OF THE NIGHT, SO FUNNY
 AND SO SWEET.
 THERE SHE IS.
 SHE MADE HER HUSBAND CRY THAT
 MADE FUN OF HIM FOR IT WHICH WAS
 AMAZING.
 Kelly: THAT'S A SIGN OF A
 HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP.
 THE OTHER GREAT THING ABOUT
 LAST NIGHT'S CEREMONY WAS THE
 DIVERSITY AMONG THE WINNERS.
 NOTABLY, SPIKE LEE, FINALLY WON
 AND OSCAR.
 Kelly: I JUST LOVED HIS
 UNABASHED JOY.
 EXACTLY, HE WAS JOYOUS AND
 OUTSPOKEN, JUST FANTASTIC.

 WON FOR PRODUCTION DESIGN FOR
 "BLACK PANTHER," SHE IS NOT ONLY
 THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN TO
 WIN FOR PRODUCTION DESIGN, SHE'S
 THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN
 NOMINATED FOR PRODUCTION DESIGN.

 A BREAK AND COME BACK AND TALK
 ABOUT THE HOTTEST FASHIONS OF
 THE NIGHT RIGHT AFTER THIS FROM
 THE DOLBY THEATRE.

 FASHION FAVORITES.
         DEAREST BRITAIN.
           WE LOVE YOU.
   MAYBE IT'S YOUR BIG HEARTS.
       YOUR SENSE OF STYLE.
        WELCOME TO BA100.
             (BA100,   YOU'RE CLEAR FOR TAKE-OFF).
  HOW YOU FOLLOW YOUR OWN PATH.
    YOU'VE LED REVOLUTIONS...
          OF ALL KINDS.
  YET YOU WON'T SHOUT ABOUT IT.
  IT'S JUST NOT IN YOUR NATURE.
         INSTEAD, YOU'LL      QUIETLY MAKE HISTORY.
              CAKE.
              BEDS.
             POETRY.
             TROUBLE.
           LOVE! HOPE!
     AND RATHER A LOT OF TEA.
       THE BEST OF BRITAIN,
         FROM THE MOMENT        YOU STEP ON BOARD.
         [music playing]         Psst. Hey, you!
  The one with the designer dog  collar.
 Wondering how I upgraded to this sweet pad?
  A 1,200-square-foot bathroom,  and my very own spa.
   All I had to do was give my   human “the look”.
   With Wells Fargo's 3% down   payment on a fixed-rate loan
       and a simpler online       application,
  getting into my dream home was  easier than ever.
     Get your human to visit     wellsfargo.com/woof.
  What would she do without me?
 50 WELCOME BACK. LET'S TALK FASHION.
 WHAT WERE YOUR FAVORITES FROM
 LAST NIGHT?

 VERY AVANT-GARDE LOUIS VUITTON,

 CROWDED LEVEL.

 HAUTE COUTURE WITH A LITTLE BIT
 OF RUFFLE, LOADS OF RUFFLES ALL
 OVER THE RED CARPET.
 VERY ELEGANT.
 THE INTERNET SAID SHE LOOKED
 LIKE A LOOFAH.
 I DO SHE IS GORGEOUS.
 SHE WAS THE ONE TO WATCH ON
 THAT RED CARPET, ANOTHER VERY
 VOLUMINOUS STRESS.

 REGINA KING, SHE WAS MY FIRST
 FAVORITE BECAUSE I LOVE A WHITE
