 THIS IS "DAILY BLAST LIVE." WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE
 TALKING ABOUT.
 EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT
 THIS.
 ALWAYS LIVE, ALWAYS REAL,
 ALWAYS UNPREDICTABLE.
 YOU ARE TOTALLY OFF BASE
 HERE.
 LOG ON AND JOIN OUR LIVE
 CONVERSATION.
 I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING
 THIS.
 I DO AGREE WITH YOU.
 "DBL" STARTS RIGHT NOW.
 THREE, TWO --
 WELCOME TO "DBL."
 IT'S TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 19th.
 WE ARE LIVE AND WE'RE TALKING
 ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE TALKING
 ABOUT.
 LET'S GET STARTED.
 WE BEGIN WITH BIG NEWS FOR
 BERNIE SANDERS FANS.
 THE SENATOR ANNOUNCED HE IS
 RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.
 HERE IS WITH HE TOLD CBS NEWS.
 SO SENATOR SANDERS, YOU'RE
 GOING TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT.
 I'M GOING TO RUN FOR
 PRESIDENT.
 WHAT'S GOING TO BE DIFFERENT
 THIS TIME?
 WE'RE GOING TO WIN.
 HE LOST TO HILLARY CLINTON
 IN THE 2016 DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY.
 NOW HE IS BACK RUNNING ON HIS
 SIGNATURE POLICY.
 THIS IS WHAT HE TWEETED.
 IF WE ARE PREPARED TO STAND
 TOGETHER, THAT IS NO END TO
 WHAT THE GREAT PEOPLE OF OUR
 NATION CAN ACCOMPLISH.
 AND BERNIE IS JOINING A VERY
 CROWDED FIELD OF DEMOCRATIC
 CANDIDATES INCLUDING CORY
 BOOKER, SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR,
 HARRIS AND MANY MORE.
 THAT'S ONLY ONE OTHER
 REPUBLICAN CHALLENGING HIM,
 BILL WELD.
 SO, TORY, WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING
 FOR AS A CANDIDATE?
 INTO DO I WANT TO SAY POLICY,
 GUN VIOLENCE AND CLIMATE
 CHANGE, YES.
 SOMEONE WHO CAN SPEAK TO TRUMP
 IN A WAY THAT I FEEL
 COMFORTABLE KNOWING THEY ARE
 THE ADULT IN THE ROOM.
 SO YOU WANT CIVIL POLITICS.
 I WANT A LEADER.
 I NEED SOMEONE WHO SPEAKS AND
 ACTS LIKE A LEADER AND TO
 RECOGNIZE THE RUST BELT,
 MINNESOTA, WISCONSIN NEEDS TO
 BE LOOKED AT AND HILLARY
 CLINTON LOST THAT.
 KLOBUCHAR IS SAYING I'M GOING
 TO THE PLACES SHE DIDN'T GO.
 I'M LOOKING AT KAMALA.
 MANY ARE SAYING HE DOESN'T HAVE
 THE MOMENTUM.
 I DON'T KNOW WHO I'M GOING
 TO VOTE FOR IN 2020.
 I WANT TO SEE ALL THE
 CANDIDATES, ALL THE DEBATES.
 I DO WANT TO SEE MONEY OUT OF
 POLITICS AND THERE'S ONE PERSON
 I CAN THINK OF IS BERNIE
 SANDERS.
 HIS POLITICS HAVE ALWAYS
 SUPPORTED THAT.
 WHAT DO YOU HOPE TO SEE IN
 KIDNAPPED IN 2020, ERICA.
 GOSH, IT'S ONE OF THOSE
 THINGS I WILL KNOW IT WHEN I
 SEE IT.
 YOU HAVE TO VOTE YOUR CONSCIOUS
 AND WHAT PAYS YOUR BILLS.
 I CAN UNDERSTAND PEOPLE EVEN IN
 THEIR LIVELIHOODS ARE
 CONSIDERED ANTIQUATED, THEY ARE
 GOING TO VOTE FOR THE PERSON
 WHO GIVES ME THE PROMISE.
 THIS WAS OIL AND GAS THAT LOST
 ME WITH BERNIE SANDERS.
 OIL AND GAS FEEDS MY FAMILY.
 WHAT ABOUT YOU?
 SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE IN

 I WANT TO SEE MORE PEOPLE TO
 HAVE THE COURAGE THAT YOU SAY,
 I DON'T KNOW.
 I WILL MAKE A DECISION AFTER I
 THOROUGHLY VETTED EACH
 CANDIDATE.
 FREE COLLEGE.
 THAT'S NOT A BLUEPRINT FOR A
 SUCCESSFUL COUNTRY.
 FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING TO WORK
 BEST FOR YOU AND YOUR COMMUNITY
 AND GO BASED OFF THAT.
 I WILL SAY TRUMP'S NAGS
 SPOKESPERSON SAID BERNIE WON
 BECAUSE HIS IDEAS ARE WHAT
 EVERYBODIES ARE AND HE IS THE
 OG AND HE HAD THOSE MANY YEARS.
 WE WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU DBL
 NATION.
 WE WANT IT HEAR FROM YOU.
 WELL, THE WORLD BOXER ONE
 OF THE MOST ICONIC FASHION
 DESIGNERS, KARL LAGERFELD.
 HE WAS THE CREATIVE DIRECTOR OF
 CHANNEL AND TENDI.
 HE DRESSED ALMOST ALL OF THE
 FAMOUS WINTER OF OUR TIME
 INCLUDING ANNA WINTORP, MARIAH
 CARRY, BEYONCE.
 AND THIS WORN BY PRINCESS DIANE
 NA.
 NAOMI CAMPBELL AND KATE MOSS IN
 THIS 1996 WHITE TRENCH.
 ANNA WINTOUR SAID HIS CREATIVE
 GENIUS WAS BREATH TAKING AND TO
 BE HIS FRIEND WAS AN
 EXCEPTIONAL GIFT.
 HE WAS SO ECCENTRIC, TOO HE
 DESIGNED COKE BOTTLES.
 THEY NEVER HIT IT BUT HE SAID
 I'M A PEPSI DRINKER EVEN THOUGH
 I DESIGNED COKE BOTTLES.
 I ALSO LOVED THAT HE BROUGHT
 HIS FASHION TO THE PEOPLE.
 THERE WAS A LINE AT MACY'S,
 WHICH IS THE ONLY REASON WHY I
 WORE A DRESS.
 HE HAD A COLLECTION WITH
 H&M, TOO.
 HE SOMEHOW IS RELEVANT FOR
 DECADES AND DECADES IN FASHION.
 THAT'S HARD TO DO.
 HE'S CLOSE TO  KENDALL JENNER
 AND ALL THE WAY BACK.
 YES, YES, YES.
 CHICAGO DETECTIVES ARE
 STILL INVESTIGATING THE JUSSIE
 SMOLLETT CASE.
 Reporter: SAM, WE'RE GETTING
 MORE CLUES IN THE JUSSIE
 SMOLLETT CASE.
 MULTIPLE PORESES TELL THEM THE
 "EMPIRE QCT ACTOR SET IT UP
 BECAUSE THIS RACIST LETTER
 DIDN'T GET A BIGGER ROW ACTION.
 HE SAID HIS SCENES ON EMPIRE
 ARE BEING PULLED.
 HE WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE NINE
 SCENES.
 THE PRODUCTION SOURCES TELL TMZ
 THEY HAVE NOW BEEN CUT.
 CHICAGO POLICE ARE LOOKING TO
 SIT DOWN WITH JUSSIE FOR MORE
 QUESTIONING.
 ERICA, I SAW YOUR BODY
 LANGUAGE CHANGE.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK?
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SEE.
 YOU SEE HIS LIFE IMPLODING
 BEFORE ALL OF OUR EYES AND THE
 IDEA THAT THIS COULD BE A HOAX,
 I HAVE NO WORDS.
 IT'S JAW DROPPING.
 I HAVE NO WORDS.
 I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE HERE
 BUT HERE WE ARE.
 LIKE DR. DREW SAID LAST WEEK
 WHEN HE WAS ON OUR PANEL IF
 THIS TURNS OUT TO BE A HOAX,
 LET'S HOPE HE GET THE HELP HE
 NEEDS.
 HE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.
 HE'S ALIENATED THE BLACK
 COMMUNITY, GAY COMMUNITY.
 I WORRY ABOUT HIM BECAUSE HE
 MUST HAVE SOME MENTAL PROBLEMS.
 ARE YOU OKAY, ERICA?
 AN EYELASH FELL.
 IT SEEMED VERY EMOTIONAL.
 I THINK IT'S AN EYELASH.
 THAT'S NOT THE EXCUSE A GUY
 GIVES.

 WELCOME BACK TO "DBL." A NEW STUDY SUGGESTS YOUTUBE IS
 PLAYING A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN
 CONVINCING PEOPLE THAT THE
 EARTH IS FLA.
 RESEARCHERS SAID IT'S EASY TO
 GO DOWN A RABBIT HOLE OF
 MISINFORMATION BECAUSE THE SITE
 SUGGESTS A LOT OF INFORMATION.
 SO IT'S TIME TO HEAR YOUR
 COMMENTS IN FIFTH HOST.
 HUGH SAID I BELIEVE IT
 SHOULD BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF
 ALL OF US TO GET THE FALSE
 INFORMATION OUT OF SOCIAL
 MEDIA.
 I AGREE.
 YOU AND I BOTH HAVE THAT TIME.
 I THINK FALSE INFORMATION IS
 PART OF WHAT MAKES UP SOCIAL
 MEDIA AND THE INTERNET ITSELF.
 I THINK WE SHOULD START
 TRUSTING SCIENTISTS, START
 TROTTING EXPERTS IN THEIR
 FIELD.
 NO ONE HAS A THEORY WHEN IT
 COMES TO FIXING YOUR
 TRANSMISSION.
 YOU GO TO A SPECIALIST.
 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
 JOHN SAID IT'S UP TO YOU TO DO
 YOUR RESEARCH AND NOT BE
 GUMMABLE.
 IT'S NOT YOUTUBE'S FAULT.
 I COMPLETELY AFREE WITH JOHN.
 YOU CAN GET UP AND WALK AWAY
 FROM YOUTUBE.
 YOU'RE NOT IN PRISON TO WATCH.
 IT TWO, FREEDOM OF IMPRESSION,
 FREEDOM OF SPEECH.
 WHAT IF IT GETS DANGEROUS.
 WHEN THIS COMES TO LIKE
 ANTIVACCINE -MY SISTER
 BROUGHT THIS TO MY ATTENTION.
 SHE'S A NURSE.
 THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF YOUNG
 KIDS IN REMISSION FROM CANCER
 THAT HAVE DIED, FOUR THAT I
 HAVE COUNT BECAUSE THEIR
 COMPROMISED IMMUNE SYSTEMS,
 THEY GOT THE  MEASLES.
 THE TWO WORDS I WANT YOU TO
 KNOW, ACTUAL MALICE.
 I KNOW IT'S FALSE AND I
 KNOWINGLY STILL PRODUCE IT.
 THAT'S HARD TO PROVE.
 YOU CAN SAY  ANTIVAXERS ARE
 TRYING TO PROVE IT.
 ASHLEY ON TWITTER SAID, YES.
 FALSE NEWS SHOULD NEVER BE
 SPREAD.
 GARBAGE IN, GARBAGE OUT.
 THAT'SY CHOOSE TO PUT MORE
 POSITIVE THINGS IN.
 YOU HAVE YOUR OWN ALGORITHM.
 YOU DO IT ON YOUR INSTAGRAM.
 IF YOU'RE FOLLOWING THE SAME
 KIND OF PEOPLE AND THEY AREN'T
 PROJECTING POSITIVE THINGS,
 THEN THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
 GETTING.
 GIGI, GARBAGE IN, GARBAGE OUT.
 THAT'S BACK IN BETA.
 AND WE HAVE NEWS.
 ARIANA GRANDE IS THE FIRST
 SINCE THE BEATLES TO HAVE THE
 ONE AND TWO SONG ON BILLBOARD
 CHARTS, BREAK UP NUMBER TWO AND
 THANK U NEXT AT NUMBER THREE.
 SO I HAVE A LITTLE QUIZ FOR
 YOU.
 CAN YOU NAME THOSE THREE
 BEATLES HITS?
 TORY?
 COME TOGETHER.
 I'M GOING TO SAY I WANT TO HOLD
 YOUR HAND AND I LOVE YOU YEAH,
 YEAH, YEAH.
 THOSE ARE ALL GREAT SONGS,
 TORY BUT THEY'RE ALL WRONG.
 IT WAS CAN'T BUY ME LOVE.
 TWIST AND SHOUT AND DO YOU WANT
 TO KNOW A SECRET.
 I DON'T KNOW DO YOU WANT TO
 NOLA SECRET INTO DO YOU KNOW A
 SECRET.
 THAT'S HOW TO GOES?
 WEIRD.
 COMING UP, A STICKY SITUATION
 THAT WAS A MATTER OF LIFE AND
 DEATH.
 WE'LL TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED TO
 A GUY WHO WAS CAUGHT IN
 QUICKSAND AND TORY GOES ONE ON
 ONE WITH ALICE FROM "LITTLE
 HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE."
 SHE CONFESSES WHAT IT WAS LIKE
 TO PLAY TELEVISION'S ORIGINAL
 BAD GIRL.
 TODAY'S WATCH AND WIN WORD IS ROMANCE.
 "LITTLE HOUSE ON THE
 PRAIRIE" SPARKS NOSTALGIA.
 ONE OF THE CHARACTERS WAS THE
 BITTER BULLY IN A BONNET, NASTY
 NELLIE OLSON.
 IN TODAY'S CHATTING UP WITH THE
 STARS, TV LEGENDS.
 WELL, MY NIGHTMARES HAVE COME
 THROUGH AND I'M HERE WITH
 NELLIE.
 THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
 I WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT
 "LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE,"
 WHOLESOME SHOW BUT YOU WERE THE
 ORIGINAL MEAN GIRL.
 FROM THE ORIGINAL 1800'S.
 WHAT WAS IT LIKE PLAYING
 THAT.
 I HADN'T READ THE BOOKS.
 I WAS CLUELESS.
 I TURNED TO MY FATHER AND SAID
 THIS IS NOT A NORMAL PART.
 SO I GO IN.
 IT'S MICHAEL ANTHONY.
 I READ THE THING AND THEY'RE
 LAUGHING HISTORICALLY.
 LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY.
 THEY ASKED ME TO READ IT AGAIN
 AND I ASKED WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
 TO CHANGE.
 WHO'S YOUR FAVORITE TV
 VILLAIN NOW.
 THERE ARE SOME GOOD ONES.
 IT'S SHAD THAT KING GEOFFREY
 HAD TO DIE AT THE WEDDING.
 PEOPLE WERE WRITING TO ME.
 ARE YOU GUYS RELATED BECAUSE HE
 LOOKS LIKE HE COULD BE MY
 FREAKING KID AND EVERYONE WAS
 DOING EVIL HAS A FACE, MY
 PICTURE AND GEOFFREY.
 OKAY.
 I THOUGHT HE WAS BRILLIANT.
 YOU HAVE A ONE WOMAN SHOW.
 I DO, CONFESSIONS OF A
 PRAIRIE B. IT'S BASED AND NEW
 YORK TIME'S BEST SELLER.
 WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE.
 YOU'RE THAT SUCH GOOD OF AN
 ACTRESS.
 THANK YOU.
 THIS IS THE BIG THING, LOVING
 TO HATE YOU.
 LOVING TO LOVE AND HATE IT.
 YOU GUYS SPENT SO MUCH TIME
 TOGETHER S THERE ANYTHING FUNNY
 BEHIND THE SCENES?
 CONSTANTLY.
 WE HAD MICHAEL LANDON WHO WAS
 THE BIGGEST PRACTICAL JOKER IN
 THE WORLD.
 I THINK HE LIKED WORKING WITH
 THE KIDS BEST, BECAUSE HE WAS
 LIKE A 12-YEAR-OLD AT HEART.
 HE WAS OBSESSIVE AND BANANAS.
 IT WORKED.
 THIS WORKED.
 THAT'S WHY THE SHOW WAS SO
 GOOD.
 SOMEONE HAD TO BE THAT DRIVEN
 AND ON IT TO MAKE THIS WORK.
 THE LITTLE HOUSE BOOKS, THEY'RE
 GREAT BUT THE TV SHOW, HOW
 BORING COULD THAT HAVE BEEN.
 THE PACING.
 THAT COULD HAVE BEEN MIGHTY
 SLOW.
 THAT'S A FAIR POINT.
 IF YOU LIKED ANYBODY AT
 LITTLE HOUSE, HE PICKED HIM.
 NO SCANDAL.
 NO.
 THANK YOU.
 I'VE NEVER ENJOYED AN INTERVIEW
 MORE.
 THANK YOU SO MUCH.
 COMING UP ON "DBL," DITCH
 THE POTS FULL OF GREASE.
 WE'LL SHOW YOU THE HEALTHIER
 WAY TO FRY WITH AIR TECHNOLOGY.
 MEET A BOY WHO'S FULFILLING
 HIS DREAM DESPITE HIS MEDICAL
 CONDITION.
 WELCOME BACK TO "DBL." TODAY'S HEART THREADS ARE ALL
 ABOUT PASSION.
 WATCH HOW A YOUNG BOY IS
 CONTINUING TO PLATE SPORT HE
 LOVES.
 A 10-YEAR-OLD HEART PATIENT HAD
 HIS WISH COME TRUE.
 ANDREW McDUFFY WAS BORN WITH
 SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS, HAVING
 HIS FIRST SURGERY AT FOUR
 MONTHS OLD.
 JUST BEFORE HIS 10th BIRTHDAY
 HE NEEDED ANOTHER SURGERY.
 DOCTORS TOLD ANDERSON HE WAS
 TOO FRAGILE FOR CONTACT SPORTS
 BUT THAT DIDN'T END HIS DREAM
 OF BECOMING A HOCKEY PLAYER.
 THEY THINK I'M FRAGILE.
 I TELL THEM I'M PERFECT.
 I'M JUST AS FINALS THEM.
 Reporter: THANKS TO MAKE-A-
 WISH ANDERSON AND HIS TEAM, THE
 EKG'S TOOK TO THE ICE.
 THEY WON 6-5 AND ANDERSON EVEN
 GOT TO FIGHT.
 YOU WANT TO LIVE EVERY DAY
 WITH FULL PASSION.
 SO IF WE TELL HIM HE CAN'T PLAY
 HOCKEY, THERE IS NO POINT IN
 FIXING HIS HEART.
 HE DOESN'T WANT TO LIVE
 PROTECTED IN A BUBBLE.
 HOW LONG ARE YOU GOING TO
 REMEMBER THIS?
 FOREVER.
 HOW TRIUMPHANT.
 I KNOW, BEING CARRIED OFF
 LIKE.
 THAT IT'S SOMETHING ABOUT
 ATHLETES.
 THEY HAVE A SENSE THEY ACCEPT
 YOU.
 HE'S DONE SUCH A GREAT JOB.
 AND FOR HIM TO SAY THAT
 MOMENT IS GOING TO CHANGE HIS
 LIFE AND HE WILL REMEMBER IT
 FOREVER.
 YOU THINK ABOUT ATHLETES,
 THEY'RE REAL LIFE SUPER HEROES.
 THEY DO THINGS MOST OTHER
 PEOPLE CAN'T DO ESPECIALLY
 PEOPLE WHO ARE SICK.
 IF HE CAN DO THAT, I CAN GET
 OUT OF THIS HOSPITAL BED.
 YOU CAN WATCH US LIVE ON
 FACEBOOK AND YOUTUBE.
 HERE'S WHAT'S COMING UP NEXT ON
 "DBL."
