Stay away from those two cases. 
- Okay, number 26! 
- Michelle, open the case. 
- Low, low, please, please, please. 
- You got the prize, you got the prize! 
- [cheering] We're going away! We're going away! 
- By opening the case that's holding the Princess Cruises logo, you have won a cruise to one of Princess Cruises' 380 destinations that span over seven continents. They are known to be the best global premium cruise line. Missy, discover the world and relax at sea. Congratulations. You can go anywhere with the girls. You got the girls' trip. 
- We're going on a cruise! [cheers and applause] Oh, my gosh. I'm so happy! 
- Two more cases. 
- Okay, two. 
- Taylor. 
- A little amount. 
- Taylor, open your case. 
- Oh, please. 
- Small amount, left side. 
- Little, left side, left side. Yay! That's good. Oh, that's good. 
- That's great. 
- Thank you. 
- That's great, one more. 
- Thank you. 
- 15, that's Madi. Madi, open your case. 
- Oh, I can't look. I'm nervous. 
- So am I. 
- Low, low, low, low. Yes, yes, yes, yes! I'm freaking out. 
- That's a great board. 
- Oh, yay. 
- You think you're freaking out? I think she's freaking out. That's because the game is going great for you, not so great for her. 
- Hello? Hello? 
- [whistles] Wake up, banker! 
- Whoa, whoa. 
- Did she just do that? 
- That was--hang on. 
- Let's go, girl! 
- What was that? You scared me. You scared me. I didn't know what that-
- did that come out of you? [laughter] How do you do that? 
- Oh, boy. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. 
- Right. Okay. All right. Okay, there's eight cases left that have not been opened. Two of them have huge amounts, which means you have a 25% chance of walking out of here with at least $300,000. [cheers and applause] You do, if you continue to play on, have to open up two cases, so it's a little precarious, but you're in good shape. She understands that you're in good shape. She knows the board, and that's why this next offer-
- 
- Uh-huh. 
- Uh-huh. 
- In good shape. and you still have an opportunity to counteroffer. 
- No, no. 
- There's so much going on. 
- No. No, no, no, look at the board, okay? You had a goal. You're in a really good position, and that number is not high enough. 
- It's a high number, though. 
- Don't take it. 
- Honey? 
- I think you should keep going. 
- Okay. 
- Okay, well. 
- So I'm gonna ask you the question. Missy Silverman, deal or no deal? [crowd shouting] 
- Okay, Howie. No deal! 
- No deal. Two cases to go. 
- Oh, my gosh. 
- Two cases to go. Only two big amounts. A little precarious, but very exciting. We'll find out what she picks when you come back. <i> [Music] [Music]</i>

- Welcome back to Deal or No Deal. This is Missy Silverman. Before the break, you turned down $53,000. You've won your dream trip. 
- We've won our dream trip. 
- Look at that board. $300,000 and $400,000 are very good things. 
- Yes. 
- Even if you knock out one of those big amounts, the next offer's going down. 
- Oh. 
- Just stay away from those two big amounts. 
- Okay. 
- Two cases to open. 
- Case number 18! 
- I can't look. I can't look. 
- Elissa, open your case. 
- Oh, please, please. 
- Good. 
- That's okay. That's okay. 
- It's really good. 
- That's okay. 
- One more case. 
- Okay. 
- Amanza. This is a very important case. If you can stay away from the $300,000 and the $400,000, you're looking at a very big offer. 
- Okay, I'm hoping, Howie. 
- So, Amanza, just stay away from those two amounts. 
- Please, please. 
- You have the best energy. Just put some into this case and it's gonna work. 
- Oh, please, low, low, low... [all chanting] Low, low, low. 
- Open the case. 
- Low, low, low! 
- Please! 
- There you go. 
- I'm scared. [cheers and applause] 
- That is good! 
- That's good. 
- Not only is that great-
- if you decide to play on, it's only one case at a time. There are only six cases left. You have a one out of three chance of walking out of here with $300,000. You still have not used your counteroffer. [phone ringing] Hello? 
- You're doing great. 
- You are. 
- You're doing really, really great. 
- Okay. 
- Let's just hear it, and we'll talk. 
- She said you did what you had to do. 
- Yep, oh, yeah. 
- I don't know what that means, but yes, I did what I had to do. 
- So therefore, she has to do what she has to do. 
- Oh, boy. Okay. Oh, well... 
- How hard was it, when you think back, to turn down $53,000? 
- It was very, very hard to turn down $53,000. 
- It was very hard. 
- Yes. 
- So if that was hard, what are you gonna do... 
- Oh, no. 
- With $77,000? 
- Oh! 
- No. 
- Look at her board. 
- Yeah. 
- Look at that board. 
- That's a pretty board. 
- And now, she only does one at a time. 
- Right. 
- One at a time! 
- It's not even time for the counteroffer. 
- Mom, then you can do a counteroffer for the-
- 
- What do you say? 
- I'm saying she should wait to counter-offer until, like, if she knocks one of the bigger ones. 
- Yeah. 
- She still can lose one. She can still lose one of the $300,000 or the $400,000. 
- He doesn't always agree with her, so he agreed. 
- This is the first time they have agreed? 
- It might be. The force is with you. I'd keep going. 
- But you realize, if she knocks out and loses one of those amounts, either the $300,000 or the $400,000, there's no safety net. 
- Don't play it safe. 
- He's saying, your son just said, Don't play it safe. 
- I know, but it's a lot of money. 
- You came to play. 
- You know, you do a lot for everybody else. 
- I do. 
- The question is, what do you want to do for yourself, Missy Silverman? Deal or no deal? [crowd shouting] [all chanting] One more case! One more case! 
- No deal! One more case! Oh! Oh, my gosh, I'm scared, but I feel lucky. 
- Yes! 
- Oh, I'm scared. 
- One case. 
- Okay, one case. 
- Just keep your safety net employed. 
- Okay, 11! 
- Brittany. 
- I'm so scared. Oh, my gosh. 
- Brittany, do what you can, open the case. 
- Low, low. 
- I'm feeling the pressure. 
- Oh, please, low, low. Low, low, low, low, please. Oh, that's good! [cheers and applause] 
- Wow! Big offer coming your way when we come back. 
- Yes! <i> [Music] [Music]</i>

In clinical trials, ORILISSA was proven to reduce 3 common types of endometriosis pain, painful periods, pelvic pain in between periods, and pain with sex. Don't use ORILISSA if you are or may be pregnant, have osteoporosis, severe liver disease, or are taking drugs like cyclosporine or gemfibrozil. It may cause abnormal liver tests. ORILISSA may change your periods, making it hard to know if you are pregnant. It does not prevent pregnancy. Use birth control that does not contain hormones. ORILISSA may cause suicidal thoughts or actions. It may also cause bone loss. Ask your gynecologist if ORILISSA is right for you. ORILISSA. Made for endo pain. One-millionth order. Millionth order.

- All right, welcome back to Deal or No Deal. Missy Silverman, mom, wife, business woman, won a dream vacation. You've got a big offer coming. You said, during the commercial break, what did you say to me? It doesn't feel real? 
- It does not feel real. 
- Oh, it is about to get real, young lady. [phone ringing] [crowd jeering] 
- Oh, the banker. 
- Hello. Okay. You said it was hard to turn down $53,000. 
- It was. 
- You said it was harder to turn down $77,000. 
- That's a lot of money. 
- It is a lot of money. 
- Oh, no. 
- There's a new offer. 
- What is it? I can't take it. 
- You have to make a decision... 
- Oh! 
- About $117,000 dollars. [cheers and applause] 
- Wow. 
- Oh, that's so much money. 
- It just got serious over there. 
- It's serious. 
- One case to open. No counteroffer. You have tears. Why do you have tears? Talk to me. 
- Because she deserves this. She is a beaming light, and she deserves everything. 
- Thank you. 
- You're welcome, honey. 
- Oh, honey, I love you. 
- I love you, honey. 
- Oh, my gosh. 
- So we discussed this. You still have your counteroffer. 
- Right. 
- You still have two really big numbers up there. 
- Yes, really big. 
- Oh, yes. 
- We may have reached her goal a little bit. [laughter] Forget the $117,000, whatever. Think about those numbers up there. 
- Forget the $117,000? 
- For a second! We're having a discussion. 
- I can't forget that. That's a lot of money. 
- Think about what the next five years you have in store for you. 
- Oh, that's a lot. 
- That's a lot. 
- I know. 
- What's in store for you in the five years? I don't-
- 
- My kids are going to college, and I don't want them to come out with a lot of loans, and that would really help. 
- That would do more than help. 
- Yes. 
- You guys. 
- What are you guys discussing? 
- I say she keeps going. 
- Keeps going. No counter. You're saying no counter. 
- Not yet. I think she saves the counter until-
- if she loses one of those. 
- Keep going, keep going. 
- It's exactly what he said. 
- One more, one more. 
- Oh, Howie. 
- Here's the thing. Right now, the only guarantee you have is $117,000, but you also have luck, you have risk, and you have $300,000 and $400,000 left in the game, so... 
- Oh, gosh. Oh. 
- I'm gonna ask you. Missy Silverman, the biggest decision so far of the night. 
- Oh, gosh, this is a big decision. 
- Missy Silverman, deal or no deal? 
- No deal. [crowd shouting] 
- I say, no deal! No deal. 
- Wow. 
- Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. I can't believe I did that. That's so much money. 
- It's a lot of money. The question now is, will your luck hold on? One more case. 
- Okay, one more case, and I want the $5. I want to see the $5. Oh, girls. Oh, all these numbers. 
- You know, it's possible that the $5 could be in this case, right? Just as much of a chance. 
- Oh. Oh! [laughter] Okay, let's go with 25! 
- Summer. 
- I don't even know. I'm scared. 
- Summer, anything. She wants the $5, but I would be happy with anything but the $300,000 or the $400,000. One more time. Hold onto that luck. 
- Oh, my gosh. 
- Summer, open the case. 
- I can't look. I'm scared. Please, low, low, five, low, low, low, low, low, I'm scared. 
- Well, you're amazing. I want my kids to go to your preschool. 
- Aww! 
- Not just because you're so kind and giving, but also, I think you're the only person who could run circles around them. 
- Oh, thank you. Give me a low number, please. [laughs] Please. [all groaning] [applause] 
- Okay, before she calls, I'm gonna tell you something. You still have a one out of four chance of walking out of here with $400,000. If you decide to go further, or you make an offer, and she doesn't accept it, and you're forced to go further, you have a three out of four chance of opening anything but the $400,000, which will make the offer after this one go up. 
- Okay. 
- So can you take the risk? Do you feel lucky? Do you want to make a counteroffer? We're about to get a call. Let's see what this is. 
- Oh, I'm so nervous. 
- Yes, of course, she's going to go down. Yeah. 
- I'm so nervous. 
- Hello. Okay. Okay. She said the safety net is gone. She said you're lucky, but not that lucky. 
- That's okay, that's okay. I'm still feeling lucky. 
- The offer dropped. 
- I knew it would. 
- The new offer is $84,000. 
- Talk to your family. 
- Talk to your family. 
- This is your counteroffer time. 
- Maybe now you counter. 
- One case to open. 
- How much? 
- I think $95,000. 
- Okay, okay. 
- You counter and you be happy. 
- Okay. I'm not really good at math. 
- Missy Silverman, deal or no deal? 
- Well, I think I might make a counteroffer, Howie. 
- Okay, counter up. And the offer is... [cheers and applause] 
- $95,000, there's the offer. 
- That's a lot of money. That is a lot of money. 
- Is the banker going to take the $95,000, or are you going to have to go on and open one more case, and if that happens, is the $400,000 still gonna stay in play? Do we accept? Is there risk? Is she lucky? You'll find out when you come back. <i> [Music] [Music]</i> <i>Pardon the interruption but this</i> <i>is big!</i> <i> Now at T-Mobile buy any</i> <i> Samsung Galaxy S10</i> <i> and get a Galaxy S10e Free!</i> I had a heart problem.

- Wow, Missy Silverman just made a counteroffer of $95,000. The banker's considering, so she's deep in thought. Very important decision, because if she takes it, you walk out of here with $95,000 and a beautiful girls' trip. You have the cruise with Princess Cruises, so you already have that, so it's a win-win. But if she says no and doesn't take your offer, the $95,000 comes off the table and you have to open another case. If that one more case you open is the $400,000, the most you can leave with is $50,000, so it's a really precarious time. [phone ringing] This is scary. 
- I'm scared. 
- I'm scared for you. 
- Thank you. 
- You're welcome. [laughter] 
- [sighs] That's a lot of money. 
- Right. Okay. All right. 
- Oh, what'd she say? 
- She said she's giving you a gift. 
- Oh, that's nice. She said that you've been saying all game, how lucky you are... 
- Oh, God. 
- And her gift to you... is the opportunity to prove it. It is no deal. 
- Oh, my God! 
- No! 
- Oh! 
- Play on. 
- I'm good with that. 
- You got this, you got it. 75% chance you're gonna win it. 
- All right, Miss. 
- Oh, I don't know. 
- We were even just second-guessing it, so that's good. 
- What case should I open? [crowd shouting] 
- I can tell you what case not to open. Do not open the $400,000 case. 
- Oh, I hope that doesn't happen. 
- That is the landmine. 
- Oh, gosh, all these numbers mean stuff to me. Oh, it's so hard. 8 is my birthday. 
- Right. 
- 13 is my son's birthday. And then 7 is my dad's birthday. Oh, my gosh, I don't know what to do. Okay, I'm gonna just say it. 
- Say it. 
- It's coming to me. I'm praying it's a low number. Number 7! Oh! 
- Oh, my God. 
- That's what I would pick. I would have picked that. 
- We're gonna pray, we're gonna pray. I'm praying. 
- This one case can make you or break you. 
- I hope it's make me. [laughter] 
- Jordana, anything, anything but $400,000. 
- So scary. 
- Open the case. 
- I'm not looking. Please, low. [cheers and applause] Yay, yay! That's good. 
- That's great. 
- That's good. 
- That's awesome! [cheers and applause] 
- I'm so happy! That's good. That's pretty good. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh. 
- Wow, look at that board now. So you got three cases left. One of them is holding $400,000. You believe it's this one? 
- I don't know. It could be. [phone ringing] Oh, no. Oh, I'm freaking out. Oh, Howie, banker, friends, husband... 
- Right. 
- Kids, audience. Hello, models. 
- Okay. 
- Oh, my gosh. 
- All right. 
- What'd she say? Please, shaking. 
- She said you pushed your luck. 
- Yes, you did. [cheers and applause] 
- Oh. Scary. 
- You say it paid off. 
- Yeah. 
- They're saying it paid off. Do you think it paid off? 
- I don't-
- I hope so, I hope so. Oh, I hope so. I hope it paid off. 
- It did, it did. 
- You would have walked out of here with $95,000, right? 
- If she took that counter, yes. 
- Yeah. 
- She didn't. 
- Would you walk out now for $165,000? 
- [exclaiming] [cheers and applause] [exclaiming] 
- Yes! 
- That's a lot of money. Oh, my gosh. That's a lot of money. What do I do? 
- Take it!

- Take it.

- Deal, deal, deal! [cheers and applause] Thank you, thank you, oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! 
- Okay, come around here. Okay, so congratulations. You got $165,000, you got a dream vacation, okay, but we don't know if you made a good deal. 
- We don't. 
- Had you said no deal and you went one more time, the next case you would have opened would have been... 
- Eight. 
- Okay, Neka, open your case. 
- Oh! 
- Perfect timing. You got out right at the right time. You had the $50,000 case. Open your case. Wow, Missy Silverman is the lucky one. Ran inf here with $165,000,
