 LYFT YES
 LET'S DO FINAL TRADES
 DARDEN RESTAURANTS, I THINK
 THAT ONE IS A GOOD ONE RIGHT
 NOW, THEY'RE GOING TO CONTINUE
 TO RAISE AND BEAT, IN IN THE
 RESTAURANT SECTOR PER MY
 ANALYST, WE'RE GOING WITH IT
 KATE MOORE, ALWAYS GOOD TO
 HAVE YOU HERE.
 CONSUMERS, WHEN I'M WATCHING
 THE MOST NEXT WEEK, I THINK
 WE'RE GOING TO GET A LOT OF
 DIFFERENT READS, WITH
 UNEMPLOYMENT AT MULTIDECADE
 LOWS, THIS IS THE BIG THING THAT
 COULD CHANGE SENTIMENT
 ALUMINA
 TWITTER
 MOTOROLA SOLUTIONS, MSI
 GOOD STUFF, THANKS,
 EVERYBODY.
 GOOD HOLIDAY AS WELL
 THE EXCHANGE STARTS NOW.
 D.C. AND YOUR MONEY,
 POLITICIANS IN AMERICA, WILL
 DEBATE THE MEANING OF THE
 MUELLER REPORT, WE ASK COULD IT
 LEAD TO EVEN MORE GRIDLOCK AND
 STANDSTILL IN D.C.
 PING AND CONFERENCING, ZOOM AND
 PINTEREST HITTING THE MARKET TO
 A LOT OF INVESTOR FANFARE.
 COULD THEY SUFFER THE SAME
 NATURE AS LYFT SHAREHOLDERS, A
 FOLD FAIR, A RECYCLEABLE SHOE,
 AND A NEW LEGAL SMOKING AGE.
 THAT'S WHAT'S AHEAD ON RAPID
 FIRE, IT'S A BIG LEAGUE SHOW
 LET'S START WITH DON CHIAO
 THE DOW IS UP ALMOST 100 POINT
 THE.
 AND STABLE RIGHT NOW FOR THE
 MOST PART.
 IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE
 MARKETS OVERALL, MIXED ONLY
 BECAUSE THE NASDAQ IS LAGGING.
 THE S&P 500 UP BY ABOUT 3 POINTS
 AND THE DOW INDUSTRIALS JUST
 ABOUT 100 POINTS TO THE UPSIDE,
 THAT'S PRETTY DECENT OVERALL,
 WE'LL SEE IF THAT STICKS, ONE
 PARTICULAR INDUSTRY GROUP TO
 FOCUS ON
 THE I SHARES TRACKS THE DOW
 TRANSPORTS, RIGHT NOW AT THE
 HIGHEST LEVELS WE'VE SEEN GOING
 ALL THE WAY BACK TO DECEMBER
 THIRD.
 SO TRANSPORT IS A BIG PART OF
 THAT STORY
 UNION PACIFIC EARNINGS BETTER
 THAN EXPECTED.
 THAT'S DRIVING THE TRADE THERE,
 IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ONE OF THE
 STOCKS OF THE DAY THAT'S NOT
 ZOOM, THAT'S NOT PINTEREST
 CHECK OUT BLACKSTONE, LOOK AT
 THIS
 8 1/2% GAINS, A PRIVATELY TRADED
 PARTNERSHIP THAT'S GOING TO BE A
 PUBLICLY TRADED CORPORATION.
 A LOT MORE INVESTORS COULD COME
 IN THE MIX, AND THEY RAISED A
 LOT OF MONEY FOR THEIR FUNDS
 LAST YEAR, BACK OVER TO YOU
 MUCH.
 SIDEWALK BOX, TALKING THAT UP
 THIS MORNING
 SO -AND THE MARKETS THAT
 DOM JUST WALKED YOU THROUGH HAVE
 TWO NEW MEMBERS TO WELCOME INTO
 THE FOLD TODAY
 YOU'VE HEARD THE NAMES,
 PINTEREST AND ZOOM ARE BOTH
 PUBLIC
 BOTH RISING.
 JUST ADDING TO THE LIST OF
 NAMES, INCLUDING SOME VERY UNDER
 THE RADAR ONES THAT HAVE DONE
 VERY WELL WHEN THEY HIT THE
 TAPE
 BOB PA SANI IS AT THE NEW YORK
 STOCK EXCHANGE WITH MORE
 WHAT A DAY
 BOTH OF THEM, NOT ONLY -THE
 FLOOD GATES HAVE REALLY OPENED
 NOT OWN BE DO THEY RAISE THE
 TERMS GOING INTO IT, THEY POPPED
 AT THE OPEN AS WELL, LET'S TAKE
 A LOOK HERE, PINTEREST
 PRICE TALK WAS 15 TO 17.
 THEY PRICED IT AT 19
 IT OPENED AT 23.75, AND TAKE A
 LOOK AT IT ON INTRADAY TRADING
 HERE
 THEY'RE GOING TO TRADE THE WHOLE
 FLOW TODAY, IT'S HOLDING UP VERY
 WELL, UP 24.35
 ZOOM, THOUGH, 28 TO 32, JUST
 FOUR OR FIVE DAYS AGO, WE WERE
 TALKING ABOUT 28 TO 32 FOR ZOOM.
 PRICED AT 36, THAT'S NOT A TYPO,
 IT OPENED AT $65
 THIS IS VERY RARE TO SEE
 SOMETHING THAT OPENS TWICE AS
 HIGH AS ANYBODY THOUGHT IT WOULD
 A WEEK AGO, YOU SEE IT TRADING
 RIGHT HERE AT $63.
 JUST OFF THAT NUMBER
 IT'S PROFITABLE, A LOT OF PEOPLE
 LIKE THAT, IT'S GOT 100% GROWTH,
 AND THOSE ARE THE TWO MAGIC
 WORDS WE GOT
 RECENT IPO'S THAT JOINS A
 PARADE, THEY'VE DONE REALLY
 WELL
 LEVI STRAUSS ALL DOING GREAT,
 LYFT IS IT ONE OF THE FEW
 COMPANIES STILL TO THE DOWN
 SIDE, NO COMPANIES NEXT WEEK,
 BRIAN, BUT THE WEEK AFTER, WE'LL
 GET ANOTHER SLEW, MAYBE I HEART
 MEDIA, MAYBE NEXT FRIDAY WE'LL
 GET UBER GIVING US SOME TERMS,
 WE'LL SEE, NOT SURE ABOUT THAT
 YET.
 BOB PA SANI, THANK YOU VERY
 MUCH
 NOW, TO WASHINGTON
 BECAUSE THE OTHER BIG THING TO
 HIT THE TAPE TODAY WAS THE
 MUELLER REPORT
 IT'S PERHAPS MORE HEAVILY
 REDACTED THAN MANY HAD THOUGHT
 OR HOPED
 BUT AT 400 OR SO PAGES LONG, OUR
 TEAM IS STILL POURING THROUGH IT
 MANY EAMON JAVERS STILL TRYING
 TO DIGEST THAT
 THE HEADLINE IS OUT THERE,
 THE PRESIDENT'S BEEN SAYING THAT
 THROUGHOUT THE DAY
 NO COLLUSION, NO OBSTRUCTION,
 THAT'S GOOD NEWS FOR THIS WHITE
 HOUSE.
 INSIDE THE DOCUMENT, WE'RE
 FINDING SOME OF THE AREAS OF
 CONCERN FOR ROBERT MUELLER,
 PARTICULARLY AROUND THE AREA OF
 POTENTIAL OBSTRUCTION OF THE
 JUSTICE, AND THE PRESIDENT'S
 PUBLIC STATEMENTS, HIS TWEETS
 EVEN ABOUT SOME OF THE PEOPLE
 INVOLVED IN THIS WHOLE
 SITUATION, THOSE WERE RED FLAGS
 FOR ROBERT MUELLER IN CERTAIN
 CIRCUMSTANCES.
 PARTICULARLY ON THIS IDEA OF --
 ALL RIGHT, SO WHEN WE GET
 EAMON BACK UP, SOMEONE PULLED
 THE PLUG LITERALLY ON EAMON.
 LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS
 FOR THE MARKETS AND POLICY
 GOING-FORWARD.
 LET'S BRING IN LIBBY CANTRELL
 HEAD OF PIMCO.
 THE DEMOCRATS ARE GOING DO
 COMPLAIN IT'S TOO HEAVILY
 REDACTED, WE NEED TO INVESTIGATE
 FURTHER.
 WHAT DO YOU SEE GOING-FORWARD?
 THIS IS HITTING THROUGH A
 PARTISAN LENS.
 THE REPUBLICANS ARE SORT 6
 CLAIMING VINDICATION HERE, THAT
 THERE'S NO COLLUSION
 DEMOCRATS MAY WALK-THROUGH THE
 DOOR THAT THE MUELLER REPORT
 OPENED, IN TERMS OF
 INVESTIGATING FURTHER, WHETHER
 THERE IS OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.
 I THINK YOU'LL HEAR LOUDER CALLS
 FOR IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS FROM
 THE LEFT
 SPEAKER PELOSI WILL DO
 EVERYTHING SHE CAN TO NOT HEED
 THOSE CALLS.
 WASHINGTON IS WEATHER POLARIZED,
 ALREADY PARTISAN
 THERE WAS NOT LEEWAY ANYWAY.
 THE BIG THINGS THAT PRESIDENT
 INTERRUPT WANTS TO MOVE
 LEGISLATIVELY, IS NAFTA 2.0,
 THAT MIGHT BE HARDER TO MOVE NOW
 WITH A MORE FRACTURED
 RELATIONSHIP
 DO YOU BELIEVE THAT, RON, TO
 LIBBYS POINT THAT IN SOME WAYS
 WILL AFFECT WHAT SHOULD BE
 BIPARTISAN OR NONPARTISAN.
 PURELY ECONOMIC NEGOTIATIONS
 YEAH, I DON'T THINK THERE'S
 ANY ESCAPING, MAYBE THE OVERHANG
 THAT LIBBY ALLUDED TO.
 WITHIN THE OBSTRUCTION OF
 JUSTICE COMPONENT OF THIS
 REPORT
 BOB MUELLER EFFECTIVELY PUNTED
 TO CON AND SUGGESTED IN THE
 ABSENCE OF HIS BEING ABLE TO DO
 ANYTHING, WHICH SAYS YOU CANNOT
 INDICT A SITTING PRESIDENT
 HE REALLY SUGGESTED THAT
 CONGRESS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT
 TAKE THIS UP, TO THE EXTENT
 THEY'RE DISTRACTED OR OBSESSED
 BY THIS, IT WILL SLOW DOWN THE
 LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND CREATE
 EVEN MORE FRACTURES BETWEEN THE
 DEMOCRATS AND THE HOUSE, AND THE
 WHITE HOUSE ITSELF
 YOU KNOW, JOHN, WHEN BARR'S
 LETTER CAME OUT, PEOPLE SAID,
 OKAY, THIS IS OVER
 IT APPEARS THAT RON IS
 SUGGESTING MAYBE WE ARE JUST
 GETTING STARTED ON A SECOND
 PHASE OF THIS.
 WELL, I THINK THAT'S BECAUSE
 BARR'S LETTER WAS SUCH A BRIEF
 SUMMARY OF THIS, AND THE REPORT
 TODAY GIVES US A LOT MORE DETAIL
 AS EAMON WAS SAYING BEFORE
 SOMEBODY PULLED THE PLUG, THAT A
 LOT OF DETAIL ABOUT THE
 POTENTIAL OBSTRUCTION THAT THE
 PRESIDENT HAD ENGAGED IN, ORDERS
 TO DON McGANN THEN THE WHITE
 HOUSE COUNSEL TO DIRECT ROD
 ROSENSTEIN TO FIRE ROBERT
 MUELLER, THE SPECIAL COUNSEL,
 McGANN REFUSING, OFFERING HIS
 RESIGNATION, AND ULTIMATELY
 STAYING ON A WHILE LONGER AND
 TELLING AIDS THAT TRUMP HAD
 ASKED HIM TO DO CRAZY STUFF.
 I THINK ALL OF THAT -AND TO
 LIBBY'S POINT EARLIER, I THINK
 IT WAS THE RIGHT ONE
 I BELIEVE THAT THE WAY THE
 ADMINISTRATION THROUGH BILL BARR
 IN THE LETTER, AND TODAY'S PRESS
 CONFERENCE, IN WHICH HE SEEMED
 TO BE SPINNING FOR THE PRESIDENT
 TO BLUNT THE IMPACT OF THE
 REPORT, I THINK THAT'S GOING TO
 MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR
 SPEAKER PELOSI TO RESIST THOSE
 IN HER CAUCUS WHO INSIST ON AN
 IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDING TO WEIGH
 THIS IN A WAY THAT THEY THINK IS
 SEARCHING AND FAIR.
 YEAH, AND EAMON JAVERS IS
 ALIVE AND WELL
 HE IS BACK WITH US, SOMEONE
 PULLED THE PLUG BUT NOT ON HIM
 LITERALLY.
 NO CENSORSHIP HERE.
 HE'S NOT REDACTED
 YOU'VE BEEN THERE DAY IN AND DAY
 OUT FOR US
 YOU'VE SEEN THE BACK AND FORTH
 INSIDE, THE SPEAKER'S CHAMBER
 AND TALKING ABOUT THIS, WITH
 SARAH SANDERS, ONE WONDERS HOW
 MUCH MORE OF ANY DIALOGUE THAT
 WE HAVE IS SIMPLY GOING TO BE
 ABOUT THE REPORT FROM NOW ON
 THE ADMINISTRATION CAN TALK
 ABOUT DEFENSE SPENDING OR
 INFRASTRUCTURE, OR IMMIGRATION,
 WHATEVER IT IS, AND EVERY
 QUESTION IS GOING TO GO BACK TO
 THIS REPORT WITH THE EXCEPTION
 OF MAYBE YOURS
 WELL, YOU KNOW, THAT'S RIGHT,
 I MEAN, FIRST OF ALL, THIS IS A
 WHITE HOUSE THAT DOESN'T BRIEF
 THE PRESS ANY MORE
 THEY'RE NOT GOING TO FACE THIS
 TELEADVISED SPECTACLE OF THE
 WHITE HOUSE TRYING TO GET OUT
 THE LINE OF THE DAY.
 YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THE
 PRESIDENT LEAVING HERE SHORTLY
 THIS AFTERNOON, IN A COUPLE
 HOURS, AND REPORTERS WILL ASK
 HIM QUESTIONS.
 I EXPECT HE WILL TALK, HE'S BEEN
 TWEETING VIGOROUSLY TODAY, HE
 HAS A LOT TO SAY ABOUT THIS.
 I EXPECT WE'RE GOING TO GET
 LENGTHY COMMENTS FROM THE
 PRESIDENT HERE
 I DON'T GET THE SENSE THEY'RE
 GOING TO REBUT MUCH OF THIS AT
 ALL.
 THEY'RE GOING TO LET THIS SIT
 AND RETREAT TO THE HEADLINE OF
 NO OBSTRUCTION, NO COLLUSION
 AND ON THE SMALLER THINGS, LET
 ALL THAT GO.
 THERE'S SOME STUFF IN HERE ABOUT
 SARAH SANDERS AND HOW SHE
 RESPONDED TO THE COMEY FIRING BY
 SUGGESTING FBI AGENTS INSIDE THE
 BUREAU HAD LOST CONFIDENCE IN
 COMEY AND THEY HAD HEARD FROM
 COUNTLESS MEMBERS OF THE FBI WHO
 SAID THEY DIDN'T LIKE COMEY, IN
 HER INTERVIEW WITH THE SPECIAL
 COUNSEL'S TEAM, SHE ADMITTED
 THAT DIDN'T HAVE ANY BASIS IN
 FACT AND IT WAS A SLIP OF THE
 TONGUE OR SHE JUST KIND OF SAID
 IT AT THE TIME, AND DIDN'T
 REALLY BASE IT ON ANY FACTUAL
 BASIS.
 YOU KNOW, THOSE SMALLER THINGS
 DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THE WHITE
 HOUSE IS GOING TO ADDRESS AT
 ALL, THEY MAY JUST LET THEM ALL
 GO, THEY'RE CONTENT WITH THE WIN
 HERE, AND THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'VE
 HAD A BIG POSITIVE POLITICAL
 DAY.
 I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH OF A
 WIN THERE IS
 I GOT THROUGH THE FIRST 50
 PAGES OF THE REPORT, THERE'S
 SOME MATERIALALITY WHEN IT COMES
 TO WHETHER OR NOT THE CAMPAIGN
 EXPECTED TO BENEFIT FROM
 RUSSIA'S ACTIONS AND
 INTERFERING.
 NOT RISING TO THE LEVEL OF
 CRIMINALITY.
 BUT FROM A MARKET PERSPECTIVE,
 THIS MAY -IN MANY WAYS TURN
 NEUTRAL, IN SO FAR AS WE'RE
 SEEING A RESYNCHRONIZATION OF
 CHINESE AND AMERICAN ECONOMIC
 GROWTH, EUROPE'S THE OUTLIER AT
 THE MOMENT, WE'RE SEEING THE FED
 BACK OFF, AND CENTRAL BANKS
 START TO STIMULATE
 IF TODAY'S RETAIL SALES NUMBER
 WERE ANY INDICATION OF WHERE
 WE'RE GOING FROM HERE, THE
 MARKET MAY RETURN THE ATTENTION
 TO FUNDAMENTALS, AND MAYBE
 IGNORE
 DAMAGE YOU FOR BRING IF RIGHT
 BACK DOWN THE CNBC LANE.
 IT'S AMAZING THE RETAIL SALES
 NUMBER BETTER THAN EXPECTED.
 JOBLESS CLAIMS UNDER 200,000
 GDP REVISIONS ARE GOING UP AT
 GOLDMAN SACHS AND OTHERS
 IT'S AMAZING THAT THIS IS
 GETTING ALL THE HEADLINES, AND
 IF YOU JUST FOCUSED ON THIS, YOU
 WOULD THINK THIS IS THE ONLY
 THING HAPPENING, OUTSIDE OF
 THIS, AMERICA ROLLS ON, AND THE
 ECONOMY ROLLS ON, AND THE
 PRESIDENT WILL HAVE A STRONG
 ECONOMY MOST LIKELY BEHIND HIM
 IN THAT RE-ELECTION BID.
 MOST LIKELY, AND OUR VIEW OF
 PIMCO IS THAT WE'LL SEE 2%,
 2 1/2% GROWTH HERE IN THE UNITED
 STATES
 YOU HAVE THE EFFECT OF FADING
 FISCAL STIMULUS, AND YOU HAVE A
 BIG IMPULSE FROM THE TAX BILL
 THAT WAS PASSED IN LATE 2017
 AND A BIG SPENDING BILL THAT WAS
 PASSED IN 2018 ANOTHER AREA OF
 THIS MUELLER REPORT THAT COULD
 INFORM RELATIONS WITH CORNING,
 THAT COULD BE RELEVANT IS THIS
 IDEA OF THE FISCAL CLIFF OF

 THE MARKETS ARE NOT FOCUSED ON
 THIS RIGHT NOW
 THAT'S BECAUSE IF COULDN'T
 DOESN'T STEP IN AND KEEP
 SPENDING LEVELS AT THE RATE THEY
 ARE NOW, COME JANUARY 1st OF
 2020, WE COULD SEE A HALF A
 PERCENT HEAD WIND OF ECONOMIC
 GROWTH BECAUSE OF THIS BIG
 DRIVEDOWN IN SPENDING.
 I THINK WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT
 CONGRESS IS EXPEDIENT.
 THEY'RE NOT GOING TO WANT TO DO
 THAT GOING INTO --
 THEY MAY WANT TO DO THAT.
 JOHN HARWOOD.
 I WANTED TO MAKE ONE POINT,
 WHICH IS THAT IN TERMS OF THE
 EFFECT ON THE LEGISLATIVE
 AGENDA, THERE REALLY ISN'T MUCH
 OF A LEGISLATIVE AGENDA, IN
 THEORY, THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS
 AN INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN, BUT
 REPUBLICAN LEADERS IN CONGRESS
 DON'T, AND THE KIND OF PLAN THE
 ADMINISTRATION WANTS IS NOT WHAT
 DEMOCRATS WANT
 SO OTHER THAN THE USMCA WHICH IS
 SIGNIFICANT, THERE ISN'T MUCH
 THAT CONGRESS MIGHT DO IN THE
 ABSENCE OF THIS MUELLER REPORT
 I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT AND
 ALSO --
 LET ME ASK YOU, LIBBY'S POINT
 IF I CAN, WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF
 TIME, DO YOU BELIEVE IT'S NOT
 ONLY BECAUSE THE REPORT, BUT
 MAYBE THE REPORT LAYERS ON, THAT
 THE U.S. CONGRESS, DEMOCRATS AND
 REPUBLICANS BOTH, WILL PLAY
 ECONOMIC CHICKEN WITH THE FISCAL
 CLIFF AND THE U.S. ECONOMY
 I DOUBT IT.
 I DON'T THINK, DEMOCRATS
 APPROACH THESE ISSUES
 DIFFERENTLY FROM REPUBLICANS,
 AND WHILE THEY'LL FIGHT FOR
 THEIR POLICY PRIORITIES, I DON'T
 THINK THAT A NANCY PELOSI LED
 HOUSE WOULD ENGAGE IN THE DEGREE
 OF BRINKS MANSHIP WE'VE SEEN IN
 THE PAST
 LET'S HOPE.
 535 MEN AND WOMEN FIGHTING WHILE
 OTHERS MAY SUFFER.
 EAMON JAVERS, GOOD TO SEE YOU
 ARE WELL
 WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED
 ON THE EXCHANGE, HERE'S WHAT
 ELSE IS COMING UP.
 AHEAD, THE CEO OF BB & T
 JOINS US
 WE'LL TALK EARNINGS, THE
 PROGRESS ON ITS BIG MERGER AND
 THE OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY.
 IPO BONANZA, INVESTORS PIN THEIR
 HOPES ON PINTEREST
 AND ZOOM
 ZOOM'S HIGHER.
 SHOULD YOU GET IN?
 AND COULD 21 SOON BE THE NEW
 18 WHEN IT COMES TO TOBACCO?
 WE'LL EXPLAIN.
       I love my Grandma.

 HNCHS SO MUCH TALK ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ECONOMIC
 SLOWDOWN, IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK
 YOJD THE GOVERNMENT DATA
 LET'S DO MORE OF THAT BY DIVING
 INTO BB & T'S LATEST QUARTER
 KELLY, IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU ON
 THE PROGRAM, SO MUCH DISCUSSION
 ABOUT A POSSIBILITY OF A
 SLOWDOWN
 HOW IS BB & T SEEING LOAN
 DEMAND
 GLAD TO BE BACK
 LOAN DEMAND IS ACTUALLY VERY
 GOOD, ACTUALLY, PRODUCTION IS
 VERY HIGH.
 OUR PIPELINE WHERE WE MEASURE
 ALL THE APPLICATIONS AND PROCESS
 ARE AT AN ALL TIME HIGH.
 AND SO WE'RE SEEING A BROAD BASE
 LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE, A BROAD
 BASED LEVEL OF WILLINGNESS TO
 BORROW MONEY TO INVEST AND
 PLANTING CAPITAL AND EQUIPMENT,
 OVERALL IT'S VERY GOOD
 ON THE STREET DOESN'T MATCH UP
 WITH THE NATIONAL RHETORIC YOU
 HEAR
 IN YOUR EXPERIENCE, YOUR LONG
 HISTORY OF RUNNING A BANK, TO
 PEOPLE BORROW MONEY, DO
 BUSINESSES BORROW MONEY WHEN
 THEY SENSE A SLOWDOWN IS
 IMMINENT
 THEY DO, BRIAN.
 IT'S INTERESTING
 THEY DO
 YEAH, THEY DO
 I TRAVEL AROUND AND TALK TO LOTS
 OF BUSINESS PEOPLE, ONE ON ONE,
 AND SO WHEN I TALK TO THEM, THEY
 TALK ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS.
 THEY'RE CHATTING ABOUT THE
 NATIONAL ISSUES.
 WHEN YOU GET RIGHT DOWN TO WHAT
 THEY'RE GOING TO DO, THEY FOCUS
 ON THEIR BUSINESS.
 SO IF THEIR ACTUAL MARKET IS
 SLOWING DOWN, THEY WILL REDUCE
 THEIR INVESTMENT
 BUT IF IT'S JUST A LOT OF -A
 GENERAL CONVERSATION, THEY'LL
 TALK ABOUT IT.
 MIGHT CAUSE THEM EASINESS.
 THEY'LL FOCUS ON RUNNING THEIR
 BUSINESS
 FORRAL THE NUMBERS, THE
 QUARTER AND THE YEAR SO FAR, DO
 YOU BELIEVE WE WILL BE IN A
 RECESSION IN 12 TO 18 MONTHS
 YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY DO NOT
 I'LL BE HONEST, 6 OR 8, 9 MONTHS
 AGO, I WAS A LITTLE MORE
 CONCERNED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY
 OF THAT.
 THERE WAS SO MUCH RHETORIC ABOUT
 TEN YEARS, AFTER A WHILE,
 EVERYBODY BEGINS TO HAVE THAT
 EFFECT
 BUT AS I'VE GOTTEN AROUND AND
 TALKED TO BUSINESS PEOPLE, AS I
 SEE THE STRENGTH, JUST WHAT
 YOU'VE BEEN REPORTING IN THE
 LAST HOUR OR SO.
 STRONG RETAIL SALES, LOW
 UNEMPLOYMENT, LOW JOBLESS
 CLAIMS, NO MAJOR GEO POLITICAL
 RISK THAT SEEMS TO BE EMINENTLY
 PROBLEMATIC, I DON'T SEE -AND
 CERTAINLY IN THOSE 12 TO 18
 MONTHS, I DO NOT SEE AN IMMINENT
 SLOWDOWN, I THINK THAT YOU COULD
 HAVE SOME EXISTENTIAL FACTORS
 THAT COULD CAUSE THAT I DON'T
 THINK IT'S PREDICTABLE AT THIS
 HAD TIME
 ONE THING THAT STOOD OUT TO
 ME, IT WAS A LITTLE SHOCKING, I
 GUESS, YOUR NET INTEREST MARGIN
 ROSE ONLY TWO BIPS
 LITERALLY.
 A TINY PERCENT
 WE'LL TAKE WHAT WE CAN GET.
 IT ROSE EVEN AS INTEREST RATE
 S LOWERED.
 HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?
 REAR A REALLY BIG COMMUNITY
 BANK, WE OPERATE OUR REGIONAL
 BANK STRUCTURE, WE'RE IN A LOT
 OF RURAL AREAS, METRO URBAN
 AREAS AS WELL.
 WE HAVE A LOT OF STABLE
 DEPOSITS, THEY'RE MORE FOCUSED
 ON RELATIONSHIPS, A LOT OF SMALL
 BUSINESS CLIENTS
 AND SO IT -OUR NIM PRESSURE IS
 MORE A FUNCTION OF WHAT'S
 HAPPENING IN OUR LOCAL MARKETS
 THAN IT IS IN THE NATIONAL
 MARKETS.
 WHEN YOU HEAR A LOT OF NATIONAL
 DISCUSSION ABOUT CHANGES IN NIM,
 IT DOESN'T INHERENTLY AFFECT US.
 IF WE DO SOME EXTERNAL LARGE
 FUNDING, THAT WILL MOVE OUR NIM
 AROUND A LITTLE BIT, BUT IN THIS
 PARTICULAR QUARTER, WHAT WE
 REALLY SAW WAS THAT OUR FUNDING
 WAS INCREASING, BUT OUR RATE OF
 RETURN ON ASSETS WAS INCREASING
 AT A FASTER RATE
 YOU KNOW, ONE QUICK LAST
 QUESTION
 YOU'RE PAYING AN ADVERTISING
 AGENCY A LOT OF MONEY TO COME UP
 WITH A NEW BRAND BETWEEN SUN
 TRUST AND BB & T WHEN YOU MERGE.
 CAN YOU GIVE US A HINT AS TO
 WHAT THAT'S SHAPING UP TO BE,
 SUN TRUST AND BB & T COULD MORE
 TOGETHER LIKE A KIDS DRINK IF
 YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL
 THE REASON WE DECIDED TO PICK
 A NEW NAME VERSUS USING EITHER
 ONE OF THE OTHERS, OUR MERGER IS
 ABOUT IMPROVING PROFITABILITY
 WHICH IT DOES ENORMOUSLY
 IT'S ABOUT LINING FORWARD, MAJOR
 INVESTMENTS AND INNOVATION,
 TECHNOLOGY, IT'S ABOUT GETTING
 EXCITING ABOUT MEETING THE NEEDS
 OF THE CLIENTS IN TERMS OF
 TECHNOLOGY AND TRUST, KIND OF
 THAT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
 TECHNOLOGY AND BRANCHS
 AND SO WE WANT TO NAME THE
 POINTS FORWARD THAT EXCITES OUR
 CLIENTS, OUR ASSOCIATES AND THE
 MARKET IN GENERAL TO SAY THIS IS
 AN INSTITUTION THAT IS MOVING
 FORWARD, IS ENERGIZED AND TRYING
 TO TAKE CARE OF THE COMMUNITY AT
 LARGE AND CLIENTS IN PARTICULAR,
 WE THINK WE CAN FIND SUCH A
 NAME
 GOOD LUCK, WE DO WISH YOU
 LUCK
 APPRECIATE THAT, HAVE A GOOD
 EASTER
 THANK YOU.
 ON DECK, THE TRADE WAR COMES
 HOME, HOW CHINA AND WISCONSIN
 ARE NOW IN A FIGHT AND IT'S OVER
 WHAT SOME SAYS FOXCONN'S BROKEN
 PROMISES
 FIRST, TO THE MOON, ZOOM BOTH
 STOCKS TRADING, DO WE NEED TO
 LEARN FROM LYFT THAT ONE DAY
 DOES NOT AN INVESTMENT MAKE?
         Who says our bank        isn't tech enough?
          Everyone, look          at your phones.
       The design thinking,     the digital engineering,
       security, blockchain,  and we will be first to market!
               Yes.
       When we do we launch?
     Unfortunately, in 2 or 3,
              hours.
          Why the delay?
       <i> Cognizant is helping</i>  <i> banks use digital technologies</i>

 TODAY.
 THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY NAMES YOU
 NEED TO WORRY ABOUT ABOUT SECOND

 THAT STOCK IS DOWN
 HONEY WELL IS UP, THEY POSTED

 HIGHER TODAY, LEADING THE DOW.
 DIVIDEND AND NET STOCK IS
 HIGHER
 LET'S GET TO CORN TESSA
 BREWER
 DEMOCRATS VYING FOR THE PARTY
 IN THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL
 NOMINATION, INCLUDING KIRSTEN
 GILLIBRAND
 SHE HAD SOME HARSH WORDS ABOUT
 BARR'S NEWS CONFERENCE THIS
 MORNING.
 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE
 UNITED STATES IS SUPPOSED TO
 REPRESENT THE PEOPLE OF THE
 UNITED STATES, HE'S NOT SUPPOSED
 TO REPRESENT PRESIDENT TRUMP BY
 HAVING THIS PRESS CONFERENCE
 TODAY, MISLEADING THE AMERICAN
 PEOPLE WAS NOT APPROPRIATE
 INVESTIGATORS THINK AN
 ELECTRICAL SHORT CIRCUIT MOST
 LIKELY CAUSED NOTRE DAME'S
 CATHEDRAL FIRE
 THE INVESTIGATORS DON'T HAVE THE
 GREEN LIGHT TO WORK IN THE
 CATHEDRAL BECAUSE OF SAFETY
 CONCERNS
 RESCUE SERVICES USE TWO
 CRANES TO PULL OUT A BUS
 KILLED 29 AND INJURED 28 PEOPLE.
 THE BUS WAS LYING ON ITS SIDE
 WITH PART OF ITS ROOF TORN OFF
 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
 A PAIR OF TECHNOLOGY
 UNICORNS, MILLION DOLLARS IN THE
 PUBLIC MARKET ARE SURGING AFTER
 THEIR PUBLIC DEBUTS TODAY.
 PINTEREST BRYCING ABOVE THE HIGH
 END OF THE RANGE OF $19 A SHARE.
 OPENED UP 25%.
 THAT SOUNDS GOOD, UNTIL YOU HEAR
 THIS
 ZOOM VIDEO COMMUNICATIONS,
 PRICED AT $36 A SHARE.
 ONLY OPENED UP 80%
 LET'S TALK ABOUT BOTH, START
 WITH BEN SILVERMAN CALLING
 SIDEWALK ALLY, THE COMPANY IS
 MORE ABOUT UTILITY FOR PEOPLE TO
 GET THINGS DONE AND LESS OF A
 PLACE TO TALK FOR FRIENDS OR TO
 FOLLOW CELEBRITIES
 WE ARE NOT A SOCIAL MEDIA
 COMPANY.
 FOR MORE, LET'S BRING IN
 DIRECTING MANAGER OF LOOP
 VENTURES
 AMAZING RESPONSE TO PINTEREST.
 ARE YOU SURPRISED?
 A 25% POP?
 EITHER THE BANKERS SCREWED UP IN
 PRICING IT OR PEOPLE REALLY LIKE
 PINTEREST.
 IT'S A DISCOVERY PLATFORM,
 IT'S NOT A SOCIAL NETWORK.
 WE THINK IT WILL BE COMPED LIKE
 A SOCIAL NETWORK
 THE GOOD THING ABOUT PINTEREST
 IS, IT'S A GREAT BUSINESS.
 PEOPLE TELL PINTEREST HOW THEY
 SEE THE WORLD IN PICTURES.
 FACEBOOK AND TWITTER ARE TRADING
 6 TO 8 TIMES NEXT YEAR'S RE
 REVENUE.
 IT FEELS LIKE THE MARKET IS
 PRICING IN A LOT OF THAT --
 FIRST OF ALL, I THINK THE
 TERM SOCIAL MEDIA IS OUTDATED
 AND DONE
 DO YOU THINK THERE WAS A
 STRATEGIC REASON WHY THE CEO OF
 PINTEREST KEPT SAYING, WE'RE NOT
 SOCIAL MEDIA
 YOU WANT THAT STAIN?
 YEAH, I THINK SOCIAL MEDIA'S
 A BAD WORD RIGHT NOW
 TWO WORDS
 TWO BAD WORDS
 COMBINED INTO ONE.
 I THINK YOU LOOK AT FACEBOOK AND
 TWITTER AND WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH
 THEM, PUBLIC SENTIMENT AROUND --
 ESPECIALLY PRIVACY ON FACEBOOK,
 BUT THE CONVERSATION
 POLITICALLY.
 THE DISCOURSE IS DIFFICULT ON
 BOTH PLOOT FORMS, PINTEREST
 TALKS A LOT ABOUT EMPOWERING
 THEIR USERS, IT'S A DIFFERENT
 MESSAGE THAN WHAT WE'RE SEEING
 FACEBOOK AND TWITTER DOING WITH
 THEIR USERS, WHERE YOU HAVE FOMO
 AND DEPRESSION
 BESIDES YOU, YOU KNOW WHAT'S
 AMAZING, IF A STOCK FALLS 25%,
 EVERYONE SCREAMS, WALL STREET
 REALLY SCREWED THAT UP
 IF A STOCK RISES 25%
 NOBODY'S SAYING ANYTHING, IT'S
 STILL OBVIOUSLY 25% MISPRICED,
 YOU SEE WHERE I'M GOING WITH
 THIS
 YEAH, IT'S TOUGH TO PRICE AN
 IPO PERFECTLY, IF IT CLOSED FLAT
 TODAY, PEOPLE WOULD COMPLAIN
 ABOUT THAT TOO
 IN TERMS OF PINTEREST, THIS
 COMPANY SOLD PRIMARY SHARES
 ONLY, WHICH MEANS THAT ALL OF
 THE MONEY RAISED FROM THE IPO
 WENT BACK INTO THE COFFERS OF
 THE COMPANY, THERE WERE NO
 SELLING SHAREHOLDERS THAT WERE
 RAISING MONEY TO FUND THEIR OWN
 POCKETS.
 WHAT THAT MEANS ESSENTIALLY IF
 YOU SEE A 25% POP, THAT IS A
 LOSS OF CAPITAL, THAT IS MONEY
 LEFT ON THE TABLE THAT PINTEREST
 COULD HAVE OTHERWISE USE TO
 REINVEST IN THEIR BUSINESS
 THAT SAID, IS IMPORTANT TO KEEP
 INVESTORS HAPPY.
 YOU WANT INVESTORS THAT ARE
 GOING TO STICK AROUND FOR THE
 LONG RUN, THROUGH THAT SIX MONTH
 LOCKUP PERIOD WHICH EXPIRES IN
 ABOUT 180 DAYS, YOU WANT PEOPLE
 THAT CAN STICK AROUND, AND THE
 BEST WAY TO MAKE THEM HAPPY IS
 TO MAKE THEM MONEY, BRIAN.
 IT CERTAINLY IS
 LET'S MOVE ON TO ZOOM VIDEO
 IF YOU THOUGHT PINTEREST IS
 DOING WELL
 ZOOM, NEW TICKER ZM, SOARING UP
 MORE THAN 75%.
 ZOOM GETTING A LOT OF LOVE, BUT
 IT ALSO FACES A LOT OF
 COMPETITION P.M.
 ZOOCHM'S PERFORMANCE SAYS A T
 ABOUT OTHER TECH NAMES THAT
 HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GAIN ON
 THIS VIDEO CONFERENCING.
 ZOOM COMES OUT OF NOWHERE AND
 TAKES THIS FIELD AND IS THE
 LEADER AND KNOWN TO BE EASIER TO
 USE, AND PART OF THE REASON FOR
 THAT IS BECAUSE IT STARTED IN
 THE CLOUD.
 SOME OF THE OTHER COMPETITORS
 AND BIG NAMES IN THIS SPACE
 STARTED ON ANTEQUATEZ CONFERENCE
 CALL
 HOW CAN IT CONTINUE TO COMPETE
 AGAINST THESE CAPITALIZED BIG
 TECH NAME COMPETITORS.
 THEY'VE BUILT A COMPANY THAT WAS
 MORE SIMPLE AND EASIER TO USE.
 YOU CAN UNDERSTAND HOW IT MAY BE
 CONTINUING TO USE THIS STRENGTH?
 DEIRDRE BOSA, GREAT
 DISCUSSION, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
 HERE'S WHAT'S AHEAD ON THE
 EXCHANGE
 COMING UP, CANNABIS
 CONSOLIDATION HEATS UP
 COULD BIG CHANGES BE COMING TO
 THE TOBACCO WORLD?
 PLUS, A RECYCLEABLE SNEAKER.
 AND A FOLD FAIR, THAT'S ALL
 AHEAD IN RAPID FIRE.
   We see homes staying cooler
        without the planet         getting warmer.

      it's a responsibility.

 MITCH McCONNELL ANNOUNCING A
 BILL THAT WILL PUMP THE NATIONAL

 IT'S A BILL, NOT A LAW YET
 IT WOULD ALSO APPLY TO VAPPING

 WE SHOULD KNOW, SOME STATES IN
 AMERICA HAVE A MINIMUM AGE OF

 IT'S YOUR BEAT HERE, WHAT'S THE
 REACTION
 WHAT DO YOU THINK.
 HERE'S THE THING, A LOT OF
 STATS WE CAN THROW OUT HERE,
 HERE'S ANOTHER ONE
 90% OF CURRENT SMOKERS TRIED A
 CIGARETTE BY THE TIME THEY WERE

 THERE ARE 16 MILLION AMERICANS
 WITH A SMOKING DISEASE IN
 AMERICA RIGHT NOW.
 THIS IS THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY
 TRYING TO GET AHEAD OF
 RESTRICTIONS THAT MAY COME OUT
 WHY NOW?
 THERE WAS A 75% INCREASE IN THE
 USE OF VAPPING BY TEENS.
 SURPRISE, SURPRISE, THE TOBACCO
 COMPANIES ARE SUPPORTING SAID
 LEGISLATION TO RAISE THE MINIMUM
 AGE FOR SMOKING TO 21.
 JUUL IS IN SUPPORT OF 21
 YEARS OLD TO BUY TOBACCO ABOUT
 THE McCONNELL RELEASE DID HAVE
 SOME DISTURBING ITEMS, INCLUDING
 MIDDLE SCHOOLERS ARE STARTING TO
 VAP.
 I TOTALLY AGREE WITH THE MARKET,
 IT SEEMS LIKE CANDY AND YOU
 DON'T REALIZE THERE'S NICOTINE
 IN IT, IT'S NOT GOOD FOR YOU
 THERE'S MONTH NICOTINE IN IT,
 THAN IN REGULAR CIGARETTES
 SO IT'S TIME TO GO TO 21
 ANYWAY, THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE
 THAT YEARS AGO
 THE DRINKING AGE IS 21
 A LOT OF STATES AND TOWNS
 HAVE ALREADY RAISED IT
 TWO THINGS CAN BE RIGHT AT THE
 SAME TIME.
 IT'S ALSO GOOD FOR PUBLIC.
 YOU ARE THE YOUNGEST ONE ON
 THIS PANEL
 DO YOU BELIEVE RAISING THE
 AGE --
 I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO REVEAL
 ANY PERSONAL DETAILS ABOUT HIGH
 SCHOOL
 DO YOU BELIEVE THAT RAISING THE
 AGE OF SOMETHING DOES PREVENT
 PEOPLE FROM DOING IT
 I WAS AN ANGEL IN HIGH
 SCHOOL, I AM STILL TODAY
 I THINK IF KIDS WANT TO GET
 THEIR HANDS ON SOMETHING, WE CAN
 PREVENT IT BY PUTTING LAWS LIKE
 THIS IN PLACE, LIKE I SAID, WHEN
 S THAT --
 SELLING JUUL PODS AT THE HIGH
 SCHOOL
 CANNABIS CONSOLE DAGS,
 STRIKING A $4.3 BILLION DEAL TO
 BUY ACREAGE HOLDING.
 THAT DEAL WILL TAKE EFFECT
 AFRICAN IN A BUS HAS BEEN
 LEGALIZED IN THE U.S., WHILE
 LEGAL CANNABIS SALES HAVE BEEN
 CLIMBING THIS YEAR, SO FAR, THE
 BLACK MARKETS HAVE BEEN RISING,
 WHAT'S THE FUTURE BILL OF THIS
 INDUSTRY
 YOU KNOW WHAT I FIND
 INTERESTING, THIS IS A FUTURE'S
 CONTRACT FOR CANOPY.
 LOCKING IN A PRICE
 BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I WONDER
 WHY ACREAGE WOULD DO THIS DEAL
 IF THEY'RE LOCKING THEMSELVES
 INTO -IT'S A 43% PREMIUM OVER
 THE COMPANY'S VALUATION RIGHT
 NOW, WHAT'S TO SAY THEY COULDN'T
 SEE AN EVEN HIGHER VALUATION,
 AFTER WE DO INEVITABLY SEE --
 YOU'RE SAYING THIS COULD BE A
 SIGN OF LACK OF OPTIMISM
 CANOPY IS MAKING A SMART
 PLAY
 ACREAGE IS A MULTISTATE
 OPERATOR
 THIS IS CONTINGENT ON FEDERAL
 LEGALIZATION, BUT REALLY SMART
 MOVE FOR CANOPY AND
 CONSTELLATION, WHICH I KNOW YOU
 HAVE YOUR EYE ON
 YEAH.
 THEY HAVE SOME WARRANTS WHERE
 THEY CAN -SIMILAR OPTION, THEY
 CAN DECIDE TO BUY MORE STAKE IN
 CANOPY
 A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE TALKING
 ABOUT THE CANNABIS PLAY.
 I'M LOOKING AT THE ACREAGE
 BUSINESS
 THEY HAVE BILL WELD, A GUY
 RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.
 I FEEL LIKE CANOPY MAY BE BUYING
 THAT INFLUENCE
 LET'S GET DOWN TO BUSINESS
 WEED'S A COMMODITY, EVERYBODY'S
 GOING TO BE ABLE TO GROW IT.
 AND JOHN BOEHNER --
 SO I'VE BEEN TOLD
 UP NEXT, LET'S TALK ABOUT
 RECYCLEABLE SHOWS.
 SHE TOLD ME
 HE TOLD ME.
 I HEARD IT FROM YOU.
 HE MIGHT HAVE
 ADIDAS JUST RELEASED A NEW
 RUNNING SHOE MADE FROM 100%
 RECYCLEABLE MATERIAL, ONCE YOUR
 SHOES HAVE FALLEN APART, YOU CAN
 RETURN THEM TO AIDID AS WHERE
 THEY RECYCLE FOR THE COMPONENT
 TO MAKE A NEW PAIR OF KICKS ZION
 WILLIAMSON SHOULD BE THEIR
 SPOKESPERSON
 I WAS THINKING.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK, GIMMICK OR
 REAL --
 IT SOUNDS LIKE ADIDAS WANTS
 TO GIVE THIS RIGHT
 THEY'RE GIVING IT TO 200 RUNNERS
 TO TEST THEM OUT
 THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE --
 THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY
 REALLY GET THIS RIGHT.
 HOW LONG DO THEY LAST
 I THINK CONSUMERS CARE MORE
 AND MORE BEFORE THIS, MORE
 COMPANIES ARE PAYING ATTENTION
 TO ECOFRIENDLY
 MARKETING THINGS IN THIS WAY
 YOU.
 KNOW WHAT THEY CARE ABOUT
 MORE, NOT ROLLING THEIR ANKLE OR
 HAVING THEIR KNEES HURT WHEN
 THEY JOG
 RECYCLING IS BECOMING A BIG
 BUSINESS RIGHT NOW
 AND AS WE ALL KNOW, JASON MOMOA
 JUST SHAVED HIS BEARD FOR THE
 OBVIOUS REASON THAT HE'S
 PROMOTING ALUMINUM AS A
 RECYCLING THING.
 STOP THE APPRECIATIONS.
 HERE'S THE THING, DON'T COME
 AT THIS AS A BUSINESS
 JOURNALIST
 YOU'RE A 6'5" INCH DUDE, I DON'T
 KNOW IF YOU RUN.
 LISTEN, WE RUN, IT HURTS
 THE SHOES GOT TO WORK, FIRST AND
 FOREMOST
 ZION WILLIAMSON WAS A PERFECT
 EXAMPLE, IF THE SHOE CAN'T HOLD
 UP, IT'S A PROBLEM
 IT THIS IS REALLY
 DIFFERENTIATION.
 ADIDAS HAS BEEN TRYING TO
 INCREASE ITS MARKET SHARE.
 THEY SIGNED KANYE TO A SNEAKER
 DEAL, HE'S NOT REALLY RUNNING
 ANYWHERE
 BUT THOSE SNEAKERS ARE SO
 COOL
 THEY DON'T NEED TO RUN ANYWHERE.
 YOU RAN THE MARATHON?
 FINALLY, WE'RE MOVING ON.
 REMEMBER HOW MUCH HYPE SAMSUNG'S
 FOLDABLE PHONE GENERATED
 IT'S GOT A $2,000 PRICE TAG.
 SOME REVIEWERS WHO GOT THIS
 PHONE EARLY, REPORTED IT BROKE
 TODD HALE FOUND THE SCREEN WAS
 FLICKERING AFTER JUST TWO DAYS
 SAMSUNG, A REAL PROBLEM?
 OR THEY JUST HAVEN'T FIGURED IT
 OUTIEST.
 I THINK IT'S A BIGGER PROBLEM
 RIGHT NOW.
 NOVELTY IS A BIG SALES ITEM FOR
 TECHNOLOGY
 THIS WAS NOVEL TO HAVE THE
 FOLDING PHONE.
 BUT I THINK THEY'RE GETTING
 AHEAD OF THEMSELVES NOW, THEY'RE
 RUSHING PRODUCTS TO MARKET
 BEFORE THEY'RE READY AND THEY
 COST TOO MUCH NOW BY THE WAY,
 $1980 FOR A FOLDABLE PHONE IS
 BECOMING TOO COMPLICATED AND TOO
 EXPENSIVE.
 CALL ME OLD FASHION, BUT I
 DON'T NEED MY PHONE TO FOLD IN
 HALF, I NEED IT TO HAVE A NICE
 CAMERA, GOOD RECEPTION AND KIND
 OF LOOK COOL
 I DON'T CARE THAT MUCH
 I WOULDN'T BUY THIS, I'M NOT WHO
 THEY'RE MARKETING TO
 WOMEN AND MEN, WE KEEP OUR
 PHONE HERE OR IN OUR JEANS
 POCKET
 HAVING A PHONE THAT CAN FLEX A
 LITTLE BIT WHEN YOU'RE A GUY
 HELPS OUT FRANKLY, DOES IT NOT
 BUT THE PHONE ISN'T FLEXIBLE.
 BUT YOU COULD PUT IT HERE IN
 THIS POCKET A LITTLE EASIER.
 I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT, I
 TALKED TO TODD ABOUT THIS A
 LITTLE DEEPER, HE SAYS THE
 RESOLUTION ON THE SCREEN ISN'T
 AS GOOD AND THE COLORS AREN'T AS
 GOOD
 IF YOUR WHOLE SELLING POINT IS
 THAT THE SCENE IS BETTER
 SOME OF THE VIEWERS
 ACCIDENTALLY, THEY TOOK IT OFF
 THINKING --
 HE DID NOT DO THAT.
 SOME PEOPLE DID, BUT IT'S NOT
 A REMOVABLE SCREEN
 THEY PEELED THE SCREEN OFF
 HE TWEETED UP CLOSE PHOTOS
 THAT HE DID NOT DO THAT AND HIS
 SCREEN STILL WAS FLICKERING.
 KATE ROGERS, YES OR NO,
 $2,000 PHONE
 NO, NOT FOR ME.
 BUT YOU NEED TO GET IT RIGHT, WE
 TALKED ABOUT APPLE'S WIRELESS
 CHARGING MAT THAT THEY PULLED
 FROM THE MARKET BECAUSE THEY
 SAID IT WASN'T READY
 WHERE'S THE BUTTON, I PRESS A
 BUTTON AND YOU AND YOU FALL INTO
 THE ALLIGATOR PITS
 AND I SURVIVE
 YOU SURVIVE
 ALL I CAN SAY IS, I'M
 EXHAUSTED NOW.
 COME ON TRENDING STORIES WITH
 BILL GRIFFITH ONE MORNING.
 OKAY, I WILL.

 FOXCONN BACK IN FOCUS TODAY WITH ITS WISCONSIN JOBS PLEDGE
 BEING CALLED INTO QUESTION
 HE WANTS TO RENEGOTIATE THE
 DEAL, SAYING THE COMPANY WILL
 NOT BE CREATING THE 13,000 JOBS
 THAT IT PLEDGED.
 FOR MORE ON THIS BIG STORY,
 LET'S BRING IN ONE OF THE
 REPORTERS NOLLING THAT STORY
 FROM THE BEGINNING
 RICK, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR
 JOINING US, CNBC WAS THERE, WE
 WERE IN KENOSHA AS WELL, A LOT
 OF PROMISE
 WHAT APPEARS TO BE FALLING
 THROUGH THE CRACKS HERE?
 WELL, YOU KNOW, WE'RE ALL
 SORT OF WAITING TO SEE WHETHER
 FOXCONN WILL COME THROUGH ON
 WHAT IT HAS SAID IT WILL DO, AND
 I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT
 THE PROGRESS TOWARD THOSE GOALS
 HAS BEEN SLOW.
 HOW SLOW, AS IN SLOW, WE'RE
 GETTING THERE EVENTUALLY, OR
 SLOW AS IN THE CAR IS NOT MOVING
 DOWN THE HIGHWAY
 THE CAR IS MOVING, IT MIGHT
 BE MOVING AT 25 MILES AN HOUR OR
 SOMETHING.
 THEY'VE MADE MULTIPLE CHANGES TO
 THEIR PLANS FOR THIS PLANT
 INITIALLY THEY SAID IT WAS GOING
 TO BE A GENERATION 10.5 FLAT
 SCREEN PLANT
 WHICH IS THE LARGEST MOST
 EXPENSIVE TYPE OF PLANT IN THIS
 INDUSTRY
 FINALLY, MIDDLE OF LAST YEAR,
 THEY ACKNOWLEDGED, NO WE'RE NOT
 GOING TO BUILD A GENERATION 10
 PLANT, IT'S GOING TO BE A
 GENERATION SIX PLANT
 SMALLER, LESS COSTLY, A MONTH OR
 TWO AGO, IT LOOKED LIKE THEY
 WERE THINKING ABOUT BACKING AWAY
 FROM BUILDING A FACTORY AT ALL
 IN WISCONSIN, THEN THE PRESIDENT
 DONALD TRUMP GETS ON THE PHONE
 TO CHAIRMAN OF FOXCONN
 ALL OF A SUDDEN WITHIN HOURS,
 THEY COME OUT WITH A STATEMENT
 SAYING, YES, WE WILL BUILD THIS
 SMALLER TYPE OF FACTORY.
 FOXCONN CONTINUES TO MAINTAIN IT
 WILL CREATE 13,000 JOBS, A LOT
 OF PEOPLE IN WISCONSIN JUST
 DON'T.
 THEY'RE NOT BUYING THAT.
 DO YOU BELIEVE.
 DO YOUR NEIGHBORS BELIEVE THAT
 THIS PLANT WILL EVER GET BUILT
 I -PERSONALLY, YEAH
 I THINK THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE
 THAT SOMETHING IS GOING TO BE
 BUILT THERE, I MEAN, THEY
 ALREADY ARE -THEY HAVE
 CONSTRUCTION UNDERWAY, SO
 THEY'VE PREPARED A VERY LARGE
 LIKE -I DON'T KNOW, IT MIGHT
 BE 60 ACRE SITE THAT HAS GRAVEL
 COMPRESSED DOWN TIGHT TO BE THE
 BED FOR THE FOUNDATION OF THE
 PLANT.
 THEY LET CONTRACTS ABOUT 2, 3
 WEEKS AGO, FOR $34 MILLION WORTH
 OF THE ACTUAL BUILDING
 CONSTRUCTION
 AND THAT'S -THAT PART IS
 UNDERWAY, AS FAR AS I CAN TELL,
 AND THEY SAY THAT THIS SUMMER,
 THEY WILL START BUILDING ACTUAL
 PHYSICAL VERTICAL CONSTRUCTION
 ITSELF
 WHEN THEY DO THAT, YOU LET US
 KNOW, YOU TAKE PICTURES WE'LL
 GET YOU BACK ON CNBC
 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
 YOU BET, THANK YOU, BRIAN
 COMING UP, THE SEARS DRAMA,
 YOU THOUGHT IT WAS OVER, IT'S

 JOINS US NOTICE IS THE AUTHOR OF THAT PIECE, NAN
 MORRISON, THE COUNCIL FOR
 ECONOMIC EDUCATION, ALSO A
 MEMBER OF OUR WELLNESS COUNCIL
 IT'S AMAZING, NAN, YOU CAN BE IN
 HIGH SCHOOL AND TAKE CLASSES ON
 THE PELOPONESIAN WAR, BUT NOT
 FINANCES
 EXACTLY
 WE DON'T DO A GOOD JOB OF
 GETTING FINANCIAL EDUCATION IN
 OUR K THROUGH 12 SCHOOLS
 THAT'S THE MISSION OF OUR
 ORGANIZATION, TO DO THAT, TO
 TEACH KIDS ABOUT PERSONAL
 FINANCE AND ECONOMICS SO THEY
 CAN MAKE BETTER DECISION, SO
 THEY KNOW HOW TO MANAGE MONEY,
 TO MAKE GOOD DECISIONS ABOUT A
 CREDIT CARD OR LOANS
 WITHOUT GETTING INTO THE
 POL
 POLITICS, IT'S HARD TO GET NEW
 CLASSES CREATED.
 WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT
 WHAT'S BEEN THE HOLDUP FOR
 SAYING, HEY, YOU DON'T NEED THAT
 14th HISTORY CLASS, LET'S TALK
 ABOUT NOT GOING BANKRUPT.
 WE TELL TEACHERS, HELP THEM
 WITH ET CONTENT, GIVE THEM
 LESSONS AND HOW TO INTEGRATE IT
 INTO THE EVERYDAY LIFE
 SO THINK ABOUT INTEGRATING IT
 INTO MATH.
 INSTEAD OF THOSE CRAZY PROBLEMS
 ABOUT THE AM TRACK TRAINS, HOW
 MANY TIMES HAVE YOU THOUGHT
 ABOUT HOW FAST THAT OTHER TRAIN
 IS COMING AT YOU, BUT NO, YOU
 THINK ABOUT WHAT YOUR
 INVESTMENTS ARE DOING?
 WE SHOULD BE TEACHING THOSE
 EXAMPLES IN MATH.
 THE WEIRD THING ABOUT THIS
 AREA IS YOU HAVE LITERALLY WALL
 STREET BLOCKS AWAY
 OUR KIDS ARE WITH NOTHING, NO
 EDUCATION THEY'RE PHYSICALLY
 THIS CLOSE, HOW DO WE MAKE THEM
 WORK FOR EACH OTHER?
 IT BENEFITS EVERYBODY WHEN
 EVERYBODY BENEFITS
 WE'RE RUNNING FINANCIAL LITERACY
 NIGHTS AT SCHOOLS, WHERE
 VOLUNTEERS CAN COME TO LEARN
 ABOUT MONEY, AND WE ALSO HAVE A
 NEW PROGRAM, INVEST IN GIRLS,
 WHICH NOT ONLY HELPS GIRLS TO
 GET INTRODUCED TO THE LANGUAGE
 AND GRAMMAR OF FINANCE, BUT ALSO
 TAKES THEM TO PLACES,
 INTRODUCING THEM TO THE WORLD OF
 FINANCE, TO PEOPLE LIKE YOU, ME
 AND SOME OF THE WOMEN HERE AT
 CNBC
 SO THAT THEY CAN SEE THERE'S A
 POSSIBILITY OF AN INTERESTING
 CAREER WORKING IN FINANCE.
 YOU POINT OUT THAT FAMILIES
 OF PROFESSIONALS, THEY HAVE 30
 MILLION MORE WORDS THAN KIDS ON
 WELFARE.
 A LOT OF THOSE WORDS OF
 FINANCIAL RELATED.
 THOSE WORDS CAN BE SCARY
 SOMETIMES EVEN TO ADULTS
 HOW DO WE DE-INTIMIDATE OR MAKE
 IT LESS SCARY?
 I THINK WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT
 IT MORE.
 ONCE YOU START SPEAKING IT,
 LEARNING THE WORDS, IT'S LESS
 SCARY.
 YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW THE
 COMPLICATED STUFF.
 YOU NEED TO KNOW, HELLO, PLEASE,
 THANK YOU, AND WHERE'S THE
 BATHROOM
 IF WE CAN TAKE THE KIDS BASIC
 LANGUAGE OF GRAMMAR AND FINANCE,
 SAME AS WE -THEN THEY'RE NOT
 AFRAID, NOT TO ASK THE QUESTION,
 OR MAKE UP WORDS DURING
 SEGMENTS
 THEY CAN DO THAT, TOO.
 NAN MORRISON, A GREAT TOPIC.
 THANKS FOR HAVING M
