 10:00 IN THE MORNING. THE LATER YOU GO TO WORK ON
 FRIDAY, THE BETTER.
 WE DON'T SEE ANY HUGE PROBLEMS
 IN TERMS OF ACCUMULATION AND
 MOST WILL BE ON GRASSY
 SURFACES.
 WE GET GOING INTO FRIDAY NIGHT
 AND WE HAVE CLOUDS LEFT OVER,
 HERE IS THE SNOWFALL, 7/10 OF
 AN INCH AND ONLY 3/10 FOR THE
 AMERICAN MODEL AND ZERO FOR THE
 EUROPEAN.
 WE WILL COME BACK AND TALK
 ABOUT A BETTER CHANCE OF SNOW
 SUNDAY INTO MONDAY.
 FOUR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS
 ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR
 CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.
 THEY ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION
 FOR ALLEGEDLY SHARING PICTURES
 OF STUDENTS ON SNAPCHAT.
 AS MANY AS FIVE HIGH SCHOOLS
 COULD BE INVOLVED.
 WE KNOW THE INVESTIGATION
 BEGAN AT ROBINSON SCHOOL WHERE
 THE STUDENTS TOLD THE POLICE
 THERE WAS ANOTHER STUDENT WITH
 THE SNAPCHAT ACCOUNT THAT WAS
 SHARING FULLY NAKED UNDERAGED
 GIRLS.
 THE SUSPECT ALSO ASKED FOR
 OTHER PICTURES OF NAKED GIRLS
 FROM OTHER HIGH SCHOOLS, LAKE
 BRADDOCK, WOODSON, WEST
 SPRINGFIELD AND SOUTH COUNTY.
 WE ARE NOT SURE IF ANY PICTURES
 CAME FROM THOSE SCHOOLS, BUT
 THE POLICE OFFICER WRITES IN
 THE SEARCH WARRANT THAT ALL
 FOUR SUSPECTS HAD ACCESS TO THE
 COUNT AND THE OFFICER SAYS THAT
 ALL FOUR OF THE STUDENTS
 CONFESSED TO POSSESSING AND
 DISTRIBUTING THOSE PICTURES.
 THE OFFICER STATES THAT HE SAW
 THESE PICTURES AND CONCLUDES
 THEY ARE CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.
 THE CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST IS
 NOT SURPRISED.
 I THINK THIS WAS HAPPENING
 MUCH MORE THAN WE ARE AWARE OF,
 THE JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN
 MEDICAL ASSOCIATION CAME OUT
 WITH A STUDY VERY RECENTLY THAT
 SAID ONE OUT OF FOUR STUDENTS
 ARE RECEIVING SEXUAL IMAGES,
 THAT IS BETWEEN THE AGE OF 11
 AND 17.

 I'M GUESSING THAT THE
 SUSPECT PROBABLY HAVE NO IDEA
 THAT THESE PICTURES COULD BE
 CONSIDERED CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 I DON'T THINK THE PERSON AT
 THAT AGE AND STAGE,
 DEVELOPMENTALLY UNDERSTANDS
 WHAT CHILD PORNOGRAPHY IS, BUT
 I ALSO DON'T THINK THAT THEY
 ASSUME THAT THERE IS ANYTHING
 WRONG WITH IT.
 IF SOMEONE IS SENDING THIS TO
 ME AND THEY WANT ME TO HAVE IT.
 SHE SAYS PARENTS NEED TO
 HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THEIR
 CHILDREN ABOUT SEXUAL TEXTING
 AS SOON AS THEY GIVE THEM A
 CELL PHONE.
 WE NEED TO START WITH BEING
 THOUGHTFUL ABOUT WHAT WE POST,
 THINK BEFORE YOU POST, HOW
 WOULD I FEEL IF THIS WAS SHARED
 WITH OTHERS?
 COULD THIS BE USED TO HURT ME?
 FAIRFAX COUNTY POLICE WILL
 NOT TALK PUBLICLY ABOUT THIS
 INVESTIGATION BECAUSE IT IS
 ONGOING.
 NO CHARGES HAVE BEEN FILED YET.
 FAIRFAX COUNTY LOOK SCHOOLS
 RELEASED A STATEMENT SAYING THE
 DISTRICT IS AWARE OF THE POLICE
 INVESTIGATION, AND SINCE IT
 REMAINS AN ACTIVE
 INVESTIGATION, THERE WILL BE NO
 ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AT THE
 TIME.

 FOR HIM, A CHILLING SCENE,
 HERE IN A PROSPEROUS
 NEIGHBORHOOD OF HOMES OUTSIDE
 THE BELTWAY, BODY FOUND JUST UP
 FROM A BUS STOP NEXT TO BUSY
 OLD GEORGETOWN ROAD AT ROANOKE
 DRIVE.
 I HOPED IT WOULD BE A
 HOMICIDE.
 THAT WOULD BE SCARY.
 Reporter: A PASSERBY NOTICED
 THE PLASTIC BAG ON THE SIDE OF
 THE ROAD MONDAY EVENING AND
 LOOKED INSIDE.
 THEY MUST'VE BEEN SHOCKED TO
 FIND THE BODY.
 WITH HIGH WINDS, DETECTIVES
 ARRIVED AND SWEPT UP THE BAG
 AND BODY AND EVERYTHING ELSE
 THEY COULD FIND.
 THEY WERE WORRIED EVIDENCE
 MIGHT BLOW AWAY AND THEY RUSHED
 THE PACKAGE TO THE MEDICAL
 EXAMINER'S OFFICE IN BOLTON.
 NOW A BIG DEVELOPMENT, THE
 MEDICAL EXAMINER HAS RULED THE

 ALMOST ANYWHERE.

 BELTWAY.
 INVESTIGATORS WILL BE CASTING A
 WIDE NET TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT
 WHO KILLED HIM.
 IN CASE YOU ARE WONDERING,
 THAT IS A BUSY SIDEWALK.
 SCHOOLS AND CHURCHES IN THE
 WILDWOOD SHOPPING CENTER ARE
 NOT FAR FROM MONTGOMERY MALL.
 POLICE WILL BE CHECKING METRO
 BUS SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS TO SEE
 IF THAT LEADS THEM.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP IS IN
 VIETNAM FOR A SECOND SUMMIT
 WITH THE NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR
 JOHN KUHN.
 THEY WILL TALK ABOUT NORTH
 KOREA ENDING THE NUCLEAR
 WEAPONS PROGRAM IN EXCHANGE FOR
 THE EVENING OF ECONOMIC
 SANCTIONS, PRESIDENT TRUMP AND
 KIM JONG-UN WILL DINE TOGETHER
 BEFORE THEY BEGIN OFFICIAL
 TALKS ON THURSDAY.
 LAWMAKERS IN WASHINGTON ARE
 SKEPTICAL THAT NORTH KOREA WILL
 EVER GIVE UP THE NUKES.
 ARE YOU OPTIMISTIC?
 NO.
 I'M NOT.
 I DON'T THINK KIM JONG-UN IS
 EVER GOING TO GET RID OF
 NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
 HE MAKES PROMISES AFTER
 PROMISES, AND HE DOESN'T KEEP
 HIS PROMISES, AND IT IS NOW
 TIME FOR HIM TO SHOW SOME GOOD
 FAITH.
 SECURITY IS TIGHT AT THE
 HANOI HILTON HOTEL WHERE THEY
 HAVE THE NORMALLY RECLUSIVE
 DICTATOR.
 NORTH KOREA BROUGHT ALL OF HIS
 FOOD AND COOKING SUPPLIES AND
 EVEN UTENSILS HE WILL USE TO
 EAT.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP'S PERSONAL
 LAWYER TESTIFIES BEHIND CLOSED
 DOORS ON CAPITOL HILL, BUT
 PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT WHAT
 WE MAY HEAR HIM SAY TOMORROW.
 WE ARE HEARING FROM
 PASSENGERS WHO ARE FINALLY
 MOVING AGAIN AFTER BEING
 STRANDED ON AN AMTRAK TRAIN
 SINCE SUNDAY.

 THE HOUSE IS SET TO PASS A RESOLUTION AIMED AT PREVENTING
 THE EMERGENCY DECLARATION TO
 BUILD A BORDER WALL.
 IT COULD COME IN THE NEXT
 COUPLE HOURS AND DEMOCRATS
 CLAIM IF THE EMERGENCY VIOLATION
 VIOLATES THE BALANCE OF POWER.
 ONLY ONE REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN
 IS SUPPORTING THE RESOLUTION.
 SENATE WILL VOTE NEXT WEEK.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS HE WILL
 VETO THE RESOLUTION IF IT HAS
 SUCCESS.
 A SHERIFF SAYS HIS OFFICE
 WILL NOT COMPLY WITH
 LEGISLATION THAT WOULD REGULATE
 OWNERSHIP OF RIFLES AND
 SHOTGUNS IF IT PASSES THE
 GENERAL ASSEMBLY.
 THE CHEF WAS ONE OF DOZENS OF
 PEOPLE TESTIFYING BEFORE THE
 MARYLAND HOUSE JUDICIARY
 COMMITTEE CONSIDERING SEVERAL
 GUN RELATED BILLS.
 AND THAT INCLUDES ONE REQUIRING
 BACKGROUND CHECKS AND PERMITS
 TO PURCHASE SHOTGUNS AND OTHER
 LONG GUNS.
 IT COSTS THE AVERAGE
 RESIDENT ABOUT $300 IN FEES TO
 MARYLAND STATE AND GETTING
 FINGERPRINTS DONE.
 PEOPLE WITH TERMINAL
 BACKGROUND, CONVICTED FELONS,
 DOMESTIC ABUSERS, PEOPLE WITH
 MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THAT MAKE
 THEM DANGEROUS CAN PURCHASE
 LONG GUNS ONLINE OR IN PRIVATE
 SALE.
 WE FEEL THAT IT WON'T DO
 ANYTHING TO FIGHT CRIME.
 IT'S JUST A WAY TO TAKE GUNS
 AWAY FROM THE CITIZENS.
 OTHER BILLS BEING CONSIDERED
 INCLUDE OUTLAWING 3-D PRINTED
 GUNS AND IMPOSING CERTAIN
 MANDATORY STORAGE REQUIREMENTS
 FOR GUN OWNERS.
 A BEAUTIFUL DAY OUT THERE
 TODAY.
 OF COURSE WE HAVE SOMETHING
 ELSE AROUND THE CORNER, A
 WINTRY MIX ON THE WAY LATER
 THIS WEEK.
 WE WILL HAVE, TOPPER SHUTT WILL
 BE BACK WITH ALL THE DETAILS.
 IN THE SOCIAL MEDIA POST OF
 A SMALL CAMERA ON  AN AIRPLANE
 ENTERTAINMENT.
 IT HAS A LOT OF YOU WONDERING
 IF THE AIRLINES ARE WATCHING
 YOU.
 I WOULD VERIFY TEAM IS ON THIS
 ONE.
 PRESIDENT TRUMP FORMER
 FIXER, MICHAEL COHEN BEGINS
 THREE DAYS OF TESTIMONY.
 I'M NATALIE BRAND ON CAPITOL
         [music playing]         Psst. Hey, you!
  The one with the designer dog  collar.
 Wondering how I upgraded to this sweet pad?
  A 1,200-square-foot bathroom,  and my very own spa.
   All I had to do was give my   human “the look”.
   With Wells Fargo's 3% down   payment on a fixed-rate loan
       and a simpler online       application,
  getting into my dream home was  easier than ever.
     Get your human to visit     wellsfargo.com/woof.
  What would she do without me?
 PRESIDENT TRUMP FORMER PERSONAL LAWYER MICHAEL COHEN
 BEGINS THREE DAYS OF TESTIMONY
 ON CAPITOL HILL.
 THE SENATE SESSION WAS CLOSED
 TO THE PUBLIC.
 THE SOURCE CONFIRMS THAT IN
 THE OPEN SESSION ON THE HOUSE
 SIDE, COCOA AND PLANS TO
 PUBLICLY ACCUSE THE PRESIDENT
 OF CRIMINAL CONDUCT.
 MICHAEL COHEN ARRIVED ON
 CAPITOL HILL TUESDAY TO TESTIFY
 BEFORE THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE
 COMMITTEE IN A CLOSED-DOOR
 SESSION.
 THE COMMITTEE WANTS TO GIVE HIM
 THE CHANCE TO CORRECT THE
 RECORD AFTER LYING TO CONGRESS
 IN 2017 ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
 PLANS TO BUILD A MOSCOW TOWER
 IN 2016.
 THEY WANT TO KNOW IF SOMEONE
 TOLD HIM TO LIE AND HOW MANY
 OTHER RUSSIA DEALS DID HE
 PURSUE AND WHO WEAR THE RISKY
 BUSINESS PARTNERS.
 WHAT I INTEND TO KEEP
 FOCUSED ON IS UNTANGLING THE
 VERY COMPLICATED FINANCIAL
 ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN DONALD
 TRUMP AND RUSSIA.
 HE IS SET TO REPORT TO
 PRISON INMATE FOR CAMPAIGN-
 FINANCE VIOLATIONS AND LYING TO
 CONGRESS THE LAST TIME HE
 TESTIFIED.
 TODAY IS JUST THE START,
 POTENTIALLY EXPLOSIVE TESTIMONY
 COULD COME WEDNESDAY DURING AN
 OPEN SESSION BEFORE THE HOUSE
 OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE.
 A SOURCE CONFIRMS TO CBS NEWS
 THAT COHEN PLANS TO ACCUSE THE
 PRESENT OF CRIMINAL CONDUCT IN
 CONNECTION WITH HUSH MONEY PAID
 TO TWO WOMEN WHO CLAIM THEY HAD
 AFFAIRS WITH MR. TRUMP.
 HE REPORTEDLY WILL ALSO REVEAL
 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HE SHOWED
 THE STATEMENT COULD HAVE
 ENGAGED IN TAX FRAUD.
 WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY
 SARAH SANDER SAID IN A
 STATEMENT IT IS LAUGHABLE THAT
 ANYONE WOULD TAKE A CONVICTED
 LAYER LIKE MICHAEL COHEN AT HIS
 WORDS AND THAT IT TO SEE HIM
 GIVEN YET ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY
 TO SPREAD HIS LIES.
 HE WILL WRAP UP HIS TESTIMONY
 ON THURSDAY WITH A CLOSED-DOOR
 SESSION BEFORE THE HOUSE
 INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE.
 NEARLY 200 AMTRAK PASSENGERS
 ARE FINALLY OFF OF THE TRAIN IN
 OREGON AFTER BEING STRANDED FOR
 MORE THAN 36 HOURS.
 THE TRAIN WAS GOING FROM
 SEATTLE TO LA WHEN IT HIT A
 TREE THAT HAD FALLEN ON TRACKS,
 THAT WAS SUNDAY EVENING WITH
 MORE THAN A FOOT OF SNOW ON THE
 GROUND, PASSENGERS HAD TO SIT
 TIGHT WHILE CREWS CLEARED THE
 TRACKS.
 WE PLAYED HEARTS AND TOOK
 NAPS, AND WE LOOKED OUTSIDE AT
 THE SNOW PILING UP.
 IT WAS SO PROFESSIONAL AND
 KIND, AND WE REALLY WANTED FOR
 NOTHING EXCEPT MAYBE SOMEPLACE
 COMFORTABLE TO LIE DOWN IN A
 SHOWER.
 I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH
 THE LACK OF COMMUNICATION.
 AMTRAK SAYS PASSAGES WERE
 PROVIDED FOOD AND HEAT AND
 ELECTRICITY AND TOILETS AND
 THAT IT WILL PROVIDE REFUNDS
 AND OTHER COMPENSATION TO ITS
 CUSTOMERS.
 IT ALL SEEMS, THEY ALL SEEM
 PRETTY CALM.
 36 HOURS, I WOULD BE FREAKING
 OUT.
 I GUESS THAT IS THE BEST
 THING TO DO IN THAT SITUATION.
 IT WAS A WEATHER RELATED
 ISSUE.
 I CAN IMAGINE WE WOULD ALL BE
 FRUSTRATED.
 BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY DID THE
 BEST THEY COULD.
 YOU ARE NOT JUST TAKING OFF
 INTO THE WILDERNESS.
 CAN WE BAN THE WORD WINTRY
 MIX?
 WE WILL NOT BAN SNOW AND
 SLEET.
 I DIDN'T ASK FOR THOSE,
 ASKED FOR TWO WORDS, WINTRY
 MIX.
 WE CANNOT DO THAT.
 BUT WHAT WE CAN DO IS TALK
 ABOUT SOME SNOW STATS FOR LATE
 IN THE YEAR AND ALSO FOR MARCH.
 LET'S GO THROUGH SOME OF THESE,
 THESE ARE NOT TOO SURPRISING.
 THE AVERAGE MARCH SNOW IS 1.3
 INCHES AND THAT'S DOWNTOWN DC.
 THE AVERAGE LAST SNOW IS MARCH
 8, AND THE LAST SNOW ON THE
 RECORD IS APRIL 7 AND THE
 LATEST SNOW BACK IN 2018 WAS
 MARCH 21.
 WE HAD FOUR INCHES.
 MARCH CANNOT, MARCH CAN BE AN
 ACTIVE MONTH AND WE HAVE SOME
 CHANCES COMING UP.
 WE WILL JUMP AHEAD TO SUNDAY
 AND THIS IS SUNDAY AFTERNOON.
 THIS IS THE AMERICAN MODEL,
 CLOUDS ARE IN PLACE BY SUNDAY
 NIGHT AND SNOW OFF TO THE SOUTH
 AND WEST AND WE ADVANCE THIS
 AND BY MONDAY MORNING, THIS
 COULD AFFECT THE MONDAY MORNING
 COMMUTE I THINK THIS IS A MORE
 SERIOUS THREAT THAN THE FRIDAY
 MORNING THREAT.
 PRETTY GOOD SNOW DOWN TO
 NORFOLK, THAT HAS COLDER AIR TO
 IT.
 IT MAY TURN BRIEFLY INTO A MIX
 BY 2:30 ON MONDAY, BUT THAT
 WOULD MEAN A PRETTY NASTY
 COMMUTE MONDAY MORNING FOR
 EVERYONE.
 LET'S TALK ABOUT THE EUROPEAN
 MODEL, THE SAME SORT OF DEAL,
 BUT WITH THE PRECIPITATION MUCH
 SOONER.
 THIS IS AS EARLY AS SUNDAY
 AFTERNOON AND SUNDAY NIGHT IS
 NOT AS COLD, SO WE HAVE RAIN IN
 SOUTHERN MARYLAND AND SNOW IN
 DC NORTH AND WE GET INTO MONDAY
 MORNING AT 6:00 AND THERE IS
 SOME SNOW.
 IT WILL STILL BE A NASTY
 COMMUTE AND RAIN IN SOUTHERN
 CHARLES COUNTY INTO CALVERT AND
 ST. MARY'S AND THAT GETS BACK
 IN THIS AFTERNOON AND BEGINS TO
 CLEAR BY THE EVENING.
 WHAT DOES THIS ADD UP TO?
 THESE SNOW MAPS ARE ESSENTIALLY
 TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE SUNDAY
 AND MONDAY STORM AND VERY
 LITTLE IS BEING ADDED TO THE
 FRIDAY STORM ON THE EUROPEAN.
 THIS IS GOING HOGWILD AGAIN,
 SEVERAL INCHES NORTH AND WEST,
 THE AMERICAN MODEL SAYS SOME
 SNOW SUNDAY MONDAY AND MAYBE
 MORE LIKE AN INCH OR TWO IN THE
 METRO AREA AND THAT'S A BETTER
 CHANCE THAN WE HAD.
 46 TOMORROW, KIND OF COLD AND
 52 ON THURSDAY, 50 ON FRIDAY
 WHICH IS ABOUT AVERAGE AND 49
 ON SATURDAY AND COLD ON SUNDAY
 AS ARCTIC AIR MOVES IN.
 ONLY 35.5 FOR A HIGH.
 LOTS OF CLOUDS TOMORROW AND WE
 CALL IT COLD.
 PLEASANT ON THURSDAY AND THEN
 THE EARLY MIX, VERY EARLY STILL
 POSSIBLE ON FRIDAY.
 TWO THINGS I WANT TO EMPHASIZE,
 EARLY AND POSSIBLE.
 THOSE ARE THE TWO MOST
 IMPORTANT THINGS TO TALK ABOUT
 ON FRIDAY.
 10:00 TONIGHT, 32 IN
 GAITHERSBURG AND 39 DOWNTOWN
 AND BY 6 AM, WE ARE 26 AND 29
 IN BOWIE AND BY MIDMORNING, MID
 30s AND LOW 40s AFTER
 LUNCHTIME.
 46 TOMORROW AND 52 ON THURSDAY,
 A YELLOW WEATHER ALERT FOR NOW
 ON FRIDAY WITH A MORNING MIX
 POSSIBLE AND VERY LIGHT AND
 EARLY AND REBOUNDING BACK TO

 SATURDAY IS NOT AS UGLY AS LAST
 SATURDAY, BUT STILL SHOWERS AND
 RAIN AND 49 IN THE THURSDAY
 AFTERNOON MIX ON SUNDAY AND
 BLUSTERY ON TUESDAY.
 WE SEE SOME FLURRIES WITH HIGHS
 ONLY IN THE 30s.
 SOMETIMES IT'S THE LITTLE
 THINGS THAT HAVE THE BIGGEST
 IMPACT AND WE BELIEVE A SMALL
 MOMENT OF KINDNESS CAN CHANGE
 EVERYTHING AND WE SET OUT TO
 PROVE IT WE GRANTED FIVE LITTLE
 WISHES WITH THE HELP OF THE
 COMMUNITY.
 LET'S START IN MARYLAND WITH
 THE STORY OF A SON WHO WAS
 DETERMINED TO HELP HIS MOTHER
 WHO WAS RECOVERING FROM BREAST
 CANCER.
 SOMETIMES IT'S THE LITTLE
 THINGS THAT HAVE THE BIGGEST
 IMPACT, SO WE PUT JARS AROUND
 TOWN AND ASKED PEOPLE ONLINE
 WHAT IS YOUR LITTLE WISH?
 AND WE ASKED NEIGHBORS TO HELP
 NEIGHBORS AND MAKE IT ALL COME
 TRUE.
 THIS IS A LITTLE WISHES.
 Reporter: I CAN'T REALLY,
 HI, HOW ARE YOU, JARED?
 YOU WROTE TO US WITH THE LITTLE
 WISH ABOUT YOUR MOM?
 YES.
 Reporter: YOU TOLD US ABOUT
 THE DOOR.
 I THINK SOMEBODY MAY HAVE
 TRIED TO BREAK IN ONE TIME AND
 EVER SINCE THEN, IT WAS OFF THE
 TRACKS.
 YOU CAN FEEL THE AIR SWEEPING
 THROUGH UNDERNEATH.
 I THOUGHT SOMETHING LIKE THAT
 WOULD REALLY MAKE HER HAPPY.
 COME ON IN.
 Reporter: HELLO.
 GOOD MORNING.
 [ LAUGHTER ]
 I WAS DIAGNOSED IN 2015, SO
 I CAN TELL YOU THAT THROUGH MY
 JOURNEY I'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT
 OF THINGS AND I WAS A WIDOW AT
 A YOUNG AGE.
 AND WE'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT.
 BUT THIS YOUNG MAN HAS STOOD BY
 ME.
 HE TAKES GREAT CARE OF ME.
 CAN I BRING YOU UP HERE?
 SURE.
 GOOD MORNING.
 YOU HAVE SOME FRIENDS FROM
 LOWE'S, THIS IS JORDAN.
 AND THIS IS TY, AND THESE ARE
 PEOPLE FROM TOP DOG, THIS IS
 LUKE AND CARLOS, WHAT WILL YOU
 DO FOR HER TODAY?
 WE WILL PUT SOME DOORS IN
 THE BACK.
 YES.
 EVERY TIME I GO TO THE
 DOCTOR, I CAN'T GET BACK IN.
 [ LAUGHTER ]
 WE ARE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR
 OPPORTUNITIES TO HELP OTHER
 PEOPLE OUT, HER STORY
 DEFINITELY HIT CLOSE TO HOME
 FOR ME BECAUSE IT WAS MY FAMILY
 MEMBER THAT WAS IN A SITUATION
 LIKE SHE WAS IN, I WOULD WANT
 SOMEONE TO HELP OUT.
 WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT
 OUR CUSTOMERS KNOW THAT WE ARE
 HERE TO SUPPORT AND SIMPLE
 GESTURES LIKE THIS COULD MEAN A
 WORLD OF DIFFERENCE TO ANYBODY.
 THE FRONT DOOR SAYS SO MUCH
 ABOUT A HOME.
 THAT IS YOUR FIRST KIND OF YOUR
 EYE IS DRAWN TO THE DOOR AND
 THAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN AND BE
 WELCOME, INSTEAD OF COMING HOME
 EVERY DAY AND BEING WELCOMED BY
 A MISSING HANDLE, AND HAVING TO
 STRUGGLE WITH INJURIES WHERE
 YOU CAN'T EVEN ACCESS YOUR OWN
 HOME, I JUST CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE
 HOW DIFFICULT THAT WOULD BE.
 YOUR SON WROTE US WITH A
 LITTLE WISH.
 BUT YOU WROTE US WITH A LITTLE
 WISH AS WELL.
 I DID.
 WHAT DID YOU WRITE TO US ABOUT?
 I WAS TELLING YOU THAT THEY
 HAVE THOSE TREADMILLS THAT YOU
 COULD WALK ON, I SAID THAT IS
 THE ANSWER, BECAUSE YOU JUST
 WALK IN THE HOUSE.
 SO CAN YOU COME HERE FOR A
 SECOND?
 WHAT IN THE WORLD IS IN THIS
 BOX?
 IS IT CHRISTMAS?
 IS A CHRISTMAS.
 EVERY YEAR, ONE PERSON GETS
 ELECTED.
 IT IS A TREADMILL, I'M SO
 EXCITED.
 THANK YOU SO MUCH.
 WE ARE STILL PEOPLE, NO
 MATTER WHAT STANCE OF LIFE YOU
 ARE IN, YOU CAN GO THROUGH
 SOMETHING IF YOU NEED SOMEONE.
 AND IF YOU CAN'T OFFER THAT
 ABILITY TO HELP SOMEONE OUT, DO
 IT.
 IT IS SIMPLE, AND THAT IS
 THE FIRST OF THE LITTLE WISHES
 WE WILL BE GRANTING THIS WEEK
 AND WE BRING YOU THE SECOND
 LITTLE WISH TONIGHT AT 11:00
 AND IF YOU HAVE A LITTLE WISH
 YOU WOULD LIKE GRANTED OR YOU
 COULD HELP US CREATE A LITTLE
 WISH, SEND ME AN EMAIL AT
 IMPACT AT WUSA9.COM.
 COMING UP, WE TALKED A LOCAL WOMAN WHO CLAIMS SHE WAS
 THE VICTIM OF A RACIST ATTACK
 AT A NORTHERN VIRGINIA
 SUPERMARKET.
 AND ALSO AHEAD, THE CAPITALS
 AND WIZARDS OWNER TELLS US
 ABOUT HIS PLAN NOW THAT
         [phone ringing]
       Remember the way we        used to do things?
            Hey man...
    Like connect with friends?
             Dig it!
         Or get in shape?
         Or sell a house
      and pay a real estate     agent a big commission.
             [crash]
       At Redfin, we charge       you a 1% listing fee.
    And because Redfin.com is   America's #1 brokerage site
       our agents get more        eyes on your home
         so you sell for          thousands more
     than the one next door.
   Don't get stuck in the past.    Sell with a Redfin Agent.
 TRENDING THE NIGHT, A VIRGINIA BREWERY IS BRINGING
 IDEAS FROM THE CEREAL AISLE.
 THE BREWING COMPANY SET TO
 RELEASE THE SATURDAY MORNING
 MARSHMALLOW IPA, THE LIMITED
 EDITION BEER WILL  READILY
 LAUNCH THIS SATURDAY.
 IT IS BREWED WITH DEHYDRATED
 EXCLUSIVE MARSHMALLOWS AND A
 TASTE THAT MAY REMIND YOU OF
 THE CEREAL, LUCKY CHARMS.
 THE CAN LOOKS LIKE THE CEREAL
 BOX THAT FEATURES THE SLOGAN,
 MAGICALLY RIDICULOUS.
 DON'T KNOCK IT UNTIL YOU TRY
 IT.
 THAT'S ALL I WILL SAY.
 THOSE TVS ON AIRPLANES,
 GREAT TO PASS THE TIME, BUT
 WHEN YOU LOOK AT THOSE FEET
 BACK SCREENS, IS THERE A CAMERA
 LOOKING BACK AT YOU?
 THERE IS A VIRAL PICTURE GOING
 ON ONLINE ABOUT CAMERAS
 INSTALLED IN THOSE IN-FLIGHT
 ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEMS.
 WE HAD EVER VERIFIED TEAM JASON
 PUCKETT FIND OUT IF IT IS TRUE.
 HERE ARE THE CLAIMS THAT
 STARTED IT ALL.
 IT SHOWS WHAT LOOKS LIKE A
 CAMERA BUILT INTO AN
 ENTERTAINMENT SCREEN IN THE
 BACK OF AN AIRPLANE SEAT.
 THIS SHOWS ONE ON SINGAPORE
 AIRLINES, BUT OTHERS INCLUDING
 AMERICAN AIRLINES ADMITS THEY
 HAVE THESE SYSTEMS AS WELL.
 AND THEY ADMITTED THEY ARE
 CAMERAS.
 LET'S BE REAL, THESE CAMERAS
 REALLY RECORDED, THEY WOULD
 HAVE SOME REALLY WEIRD VIDEOS,
 HOPEFULLY OF PEOPLE SLEEPING,
 BUT IT IS ALARMING TO THINK
 ABOUT ANYONE WATCHING YOU
 SLEEPING, THE CAMERAS DON'T
 ACTUALLY RECORD, THAT'S WHAT
 THE AIRLINES TOLD US DIRECTLY.
 ACCORDING TO AMERICAN AIRLINES
 PRIVATE JETS, IT FITS IN THEIR
 PLANES, THE MAKERS OF THE
 SYSTEMS MAKE CAMERAS AND OTHER
 PIECES OF TECHNOLOGY, BUT THE
 FEATURES ARE NOT BEING FEATURED
 ON FLIGHTS.
 AMERICANS AS THEY AREN'T BEING
 USED AND THEY ARE CONSIDERING
 USING THEM EITHER, IT JUST
 HAPPENS TO BE PART OF THE
 SYSTEM THAT WORKS BEST FOR THE
 PLANE.
 ARE THERE ACTUALLY CAMERAS ON
 IN-FLIGHT ENTERTAINMENT
 SCREENS?
 YES.
 ARE THOSE USED FOR RECORDING
 YOU?
 NO.

 THE NEWS AT FIVE ACTOR
 BEGINS WITH THIS QUESTION, WAS
 IT A RACIST ATTACK?
 FAIRFAX COUNTY POLICE ARE
 INVESTIGATING EVERY WOMAN SAYS
 SHE WAS TARGETED AT A
 SPRINGFIELD GIANT SUPERMARKET.
 AND IT JUST GOT PHYSICAL.
 STEPHANIE RAMIREZ HAS SOME
 DETAILS FOR US.
 SHE TELLS US SHE WAS PARKED
 IN THE SUPERMARKET PICKUP LANE
 JUST LIKE WE ARE AND AT ONE
 POINT, THE MAN EVEN REACHED
 INTO HER WINDOW TO GRAB A CELL
 PHONE.
 AND I AM WRESTLING WITH HIM,
 AND MEANWHILE I'M THINKING OH,
 MY GOD, NO ONE IS SEEING THIS
 AND I'M REACTING AT THE MOMENT.
 BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING
 TO HAPPEN TO ME.
 THIS IS MAKING ME FEEL, JUST IN
 SHOCK.
 AND IT DIDN'T STOP THERE.
 THE 53-YEAR-OLD ERICA RIGGS
 FROM SPRINGFIELD VIRGINIA IS
 OUT OF TOWN DOING WORK FOR THE
 ADVERTISING CLUB OF NEW YORK.
 WE TALKED ON FACETIME, RIGGS
 TELLS US THAT ABOUT 4:30 PM
 FEBRUARY 19, SHE DROPPED OFF
 HER 80-YEAR-OLD MOTHER AT THIS
 SPRINGFIELD GIANT SUPERMARKET
 WHEN THIS MAN APPROACHED HER
 CAR.
 WE ARE NOT SHOWING HIS FACE
 BECAUSE HE HAS NOT
