 FINAL PHASE BEFORE KRISTOFF ST. JOHN'S DEATH.
 WHAT REALLY HAPPENED?
 HIS EX-WIFE OPENS UP ABOUT HIS
 PERSONAL DEMONS, THEIR LAST
 CONVERSATION.
 AND WHAT HE SAID HE SAW RIGHT
 BEFORE HE DIED.
 PLUS --
 BASICALLY A TATTOO ON YOUR
 FACE.
 ADDICTED.
 PERMANENT MAKEUP REGRETS.
 COMING UP NEXT.

 DR. OZ: SEASON 10 STARTS NOW.
 HE WAS A SOAP OPERA SUPERSTAR.
 KRISTOFF ST. JOHN WAS BEST KNOWN
 FOR HIS ROLE IN THE YOUNG AND
 THE RESTLESS.
 THE TAKE CHARGE, CHARISMATIC
 BUSINESSMAN WAS A ROLE HE PLAYED
 FOR NEARLY 30 YEARS.
 HIS SUDDEN DEATH STUNNED
 MILLIONS OF FANS AROUND THE
 WORLD AND THE HEARTBREAKING NEWS
 COMES JUST FOUR YEARS AFTER HIS
 SON COMMITTED SUICIDE.
 TODAY, KRISTOFF'S EX-WIFE MIA IS
 HERE, OPENING UP ABOUT THE
 TRAGIC LOSS AND WHAT REALLY
 HAPPENED TO KRISTOFF IN THOSE
 FINAL DAYS.
 HERE'S A LOOK AT THE ROLE THAT
 MADE HIM FAMOUS.
 HOW IS EVERYTHING ELSE IN
 YOUR LIFE?
 REALLY GOOD, ACTUALLY.
 THANKS TO THIS ONE HERE.
 I KNEW I COULD COUNT ON YOU.
 THANK YOU.
 I FIGURED YOU COULD USE SOME
 FAMILY AROUND.
 SHE'S BEEN HELPING ME GET MY
 HEAD ON STRAIGHT.
 I'M SEEING A THERAPIST NOW,
 SLEEPING REGULARLY.
 GLAD TO HEAR IT.
 WORK LIFE IS GOOD.
 PERSONAL LIFE IS GOOD.
 YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ME
 ANYMORE.
 DON'T GO GETTING CRAZY ON ME.
 IT IS A FATHER'S JOB TO WORRY
 ABOUT HIS KIDS.
 DR. OZ: KRISTOFF'S EX-WIFE MIA
 JOINS ME NOW.
 I KNOW IT IS HARD.
 MIA: I DIDN'T EXPECT IT TO BE SO
 -- SORRY.
 DR. OZ: DON'T BE SORRY.
 IT HAS ONLY BEEN THREE WEEKS.
 I PICKED SOMETHING THAT I
 THOUGHT IT WOULD REMIND
 EVERYBODY WHAT A GREAT ACTOR HE
 WAS.
 MIA: HE WAS SO AMAZING.
 A TWO-TIME EMMY AWARD-WINNING
 ACTOR AND HE HAD BEEN ACTING
 SINCE HE WAS A KID.
 HE LOVED IT.
 IT WAS HIS LIFE.
 DR. OZ: HOW ARE YOU DOING?
 MIA: STRUGGLING.
 I NEVER RECOVERED, REALLY, FROM
 THE DEATH OF OUR SON.
 AND NOW WITH THE DEATH OF
 KRISTOFF, IT IS A LOT.
 BUT I KNOW THAT THERE'S SO MANY
 PEOPLE COUNTING ON ME AND MY
 DAUGHTER, AND JUST FOR KRISTOFF
 AND JULIAN TO KNOW THAT I'M
 STILL HERE FIGHTING AND I'M
 GOING TO CONTINUE TO FIGHT.
 DR. OZ: LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT
 ABOUT KRISTOFF.
 HE WAS CHARISMATIC, STRONG,
 CONFIDENT, SO MANY ADJECTIVES,
 MASCULINE ADJECTIVES, AND THAT
 CONFIDENCE WASN'T THERE
 OFF-CAMERA AS MUCH.
 MIA: NO, HE ALWAYS APPEARED TO
 ME AND A LOT OF PEOPLE TO BE
 LIKE THE MOST CONFIDENT PERSON
 I'VE EVER MET.
 BUT AT HOME, PERSONALLY, WITH
 HIS FAMILY, HE WAWAS ACTUALLY VY
 INSECURE ABOUT HIMSELF.
 I JUST COULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT.
 HE WAS SO GOOD-LOOKING, SO
 CHARMING, AND MY GOODNESS, WITH
 THE LADIES, HE WAS SO POPULAR.
 INSIDE, THERE WAS JUST A VERY
 INSECURE, LONELY PERSON.
 DR. OZ: LONELY?
 MIA: LONELY.
 HE WOULD OFTEN JUST HIDE IN HIS
 HOUSE AND NOT GO OUT, BA
 RECLUSE.
 DR. OZ: YOU WERE MARRIED TO
 KRISTOFF FOR FIVE YEARS.
 TWO WONDERFUL CHILDREN.
 WHAT KIND OF A FATHER WAS HE?
 MIA: HE WAS THE DISCIPLINARIAN.
 OUT OF THE TWO OF US, HE WAS --
 HE COULDN'T DO IT FOR VERY LONG.
 HE WOULD ALWAYS BE A JOKESTER,
 VERY LOVING WITH THE KIDS, VERY
 FUNNY, ALWAYS HAD SUCH A GREAT
 TIME WITH THEM.
 AND ESPECIALLY DURING MY CAREER,
 HE REALLY STEPPED UP AND PLAYED
 THE ROLE OF MOM AND DAD.
 HE WAS A GREAT FATHER.
 OBVIOUSLY THE RELATIONSHIP
 BETWEEN HIM AND HIS SON BECAME
 VERY TURBULENT AS MY SON GOT
 OLDER.
 DR. OZ: A WORLD CHAMPION BOXER,
 ACCOMPLISHED IN YOUR OWN RIGHT,
 YOU ARE MARRIED TO A MAN WHO IS
 POWERFUL ONSTAGE, BUT LONELY AND
 INSECURE AT HOME.
 JULIAN, YOUR SON, HAS MENTAL
 HEALTH ISSUES.
 MIA: HE HAS CRIST --
 SCHIZOPHRENIA AND KRISTOFF HAD
 BIPOLAR.
 DR. OZ: YOUR SON TOOK HIS LIFE
 FOR YEARS AGO.
 MIA: YES, IN A MENTAL HEALTH
 FACILITY.
 DR. OZ: HOW DID KRISTOFF DEAL
 WITH THAT?
 MIA: IT WAS OUR BIGGEST
 NIGHTMARE.
 HE NEVER COULD RECOVER FROM THE
 GUILT.
 HE FELT GUILTY, RESPONSIBLE.
 EVEN THOUGH THE FACILITY WAS
 FOUND GUILTY OF NEGLECT AND
 FALSIFYING RECORDS.
 I KEPT TRYING TO TELL HIM OVER
 AND OVER AGAIN THAT IT WAS NOT
 HIS FAULT, BUT THERE WAS NOTHING
 I COULD SAY OR DO TO MAKE HIM
 BELIEVE THAT.
 HE FELT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
 DEATH OF OUR SON.
 DR. OZ: YOU RETREATED THIS POST
 FROM JANUARY, GRIEVING A LOSS OF
 A CHILD IS A PROCESS.
 IT BEGINS THE DAY YOUR CHILD
 PASSES AND ENDS THE DATA PARENT
 JOINS THEM.
 KRISTOFF RETWEETED, NEVER A
 TRUER WORD WAS SPOKEN.
 HE TWEETED THIS LESS THAN A
 MONTH BEFORE HE DIED.
 WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT TWEET?
 MIA: NOTHING, BECAUSE THIS WAS
 OUR DAILY CONVERSATION.
 WHEN PEOPLE TELL ME ABOUT THIS,
 I SAY, I DON'T REMEMBER A DAY
 THAT HE DIDN'T CRY ABOUT HIS
 SON.
 THIS IS REALLY ALL WE TALKED
 ABOUT.
 DR. OZ: HE CARRIED THAT BURDEN,
 YOU ARE FEELING THE PAIN TOO,
 BUT WITH YOUR HUSBAND'S BIPOLAR
 DIAGNOSIS, WAS HE ABLE TO GET
 HIMSELF BACK TOGETHER AGAIN?
 DID HE TAKE HIS MEDICATION?
 WAS HE DOING HIS BEST, DO YOU
 FEEL?
 MIA: HE WAS SELF-MEDICATING.
 WE WERE BOTH IN RECOVERY.
 I HAD 30 YEARS OF SOBRIETY.
 HE HAD MANY YEARS, AND AFTER OUR
 SON PASSED, HE WENT OFF THE
 WAGON.
 BUT HE WAS TAKING HIS MEDS.
 I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW AS A
 DOCTOR, THESE MEDS, THEY ARE
 NEVER GOING TO CURE THE ILLNESS.
 THEY MIGHT HELP THE SYMPTOMS.
 SO HE ALSO SELF MEDICATED FOR
 WHAT THE PILLS DID NOT DO, WHICH
 WAS OUR GRIEF.
 DR. OZ: WHEN HE HAD SACRIFICED
 HIS SOBRIETY AND WAS
 SELF-MEDICATING, DO YOU FEEL HE
 WAS IN A DANGEROUS SITUATION?
 WAS THERE A TIME HE MIGHT HAVE
 THREATENED TO TAKE HIS LIFE, OR
 DID HE TRY TO TAKE ACTION ON
 THAT?
 MIA: HE WAS ALWAYS THREATENING.
 DR. OZ: HE WAS?
 MIA: ALWAYS.
 THE LAST TIME I TALKED TO HIM,
 EVEN -- OUR ATTORNEY HAD HIM
 5150'ED RECENTLY, RIGHT BEFORE
 HE PASSED.
 DR. OZ: 5150 MEANS PUTTING HIM
 IN A PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTION.
 MIA: YES.
 OUR ATTORNEY INTENDED HIM TO BE
 THERE FOR A 50 TO 50, WHICH WAS
 A TWO-WEEK-OLD.
 THEY LET HIM OUT ON THE FOURTH
 DAY.
 DR. OZ: IF I UNDERSTAND
 CORRECTLY, WHAT PROMPTED THAT
 ACTION WAS THAT YOUR HUSBAND HAD
 TAKEN A GUN AND PUT IT TO HIS
 HEAD.
 IS THAT CORRECT?
 MIA: IN THE PREVIOUS MONTH, YES.
 DR. OZ: THAT IS PRETTY SCARY.
 MIA: SO WE KNEW THAT THAT WAS
 GOING THROUGH HIS MIND.
 DR. OZ: WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO
 HIM?
 MIA: OF COURSE I TOLD HIM THIS
 IS NOT WHAT JULIAN WANTS FROM
 YOU.
 HE WANTS YOU TO GO ON AND BE
 HAPPY AND LEAD A PRODUCTIVE
 LIFE.
 DR. OZ: NEXT, MIA'S FINAL
 CONVERSATION WITH KRISTOFF.
 FIND OUT WHAT HE SAYS HE SAW
 RIGHT BEFORE HIS SUDDEN DEATH.

 DR. OZ: IT IS HARD TO LOOK AT. MIA: IT IS HARD.
 HIS PICTURES -- I'VE JUST TRIED
 NOT TO BECAUSE IT IS TOO MUCH
 RIGHT NOW.
 TO SEE HIM.
 BECAUSE HE IS STILL HERE.
 DR. OZ: HE IS STILL HERE.
 AND I LOVE SEEING ALL THESE
 SUPERSTARS.
 THESE ARE TWEETS FROM KRISTOFF
 ST. JOHN'S COSTARS.
 MILLIONS OF FANS AROUND THE
 WORLD STILL SEARCHING FOR
 ANSWERS AFTER KRISTOFF
 TRAGICALLY DIED.
 YOU WERE RIGHT THERE, TALKING TO
 HIM, AS THOSE FINAL DECISIONS
 WERE BEING MADE.
 WHEN YOU CALLED HIM, WHAT DID HE
 SAY?
 MIA: HE CALLED ME AT 11:00 THAT
 MORNING.
 IT WAS SUPER BOWL SUNDAY.
 THE FIRST THING OUT OF HIS MOUTH
 WAS, THANK GOD YOU ANSWERED.
 I SAID, WHAT IS GOING ON.
 HE WAS JUST REALLY DEPRESSED AND
 DRINKING, JUST SOBBING ABOUT
 OUR SON, SAYING -- AT ONE POINT,
 HE JUST SAID, I WANT TO DIE.
 AND I JUST -- I HAD A FEAR OF
 DEATH, SO I WOULD REMEMBER, AND
 HE WOULD SAY, YOU ARE RIGHT.
 THEN I GOT REALLY PANICKED WHEN
 HE SAID, HANG ON A SECOND.
 JULIAN IS HERE.
 DR. OZ: YOUR SON?
 MIA: RIGHT.
 AND I SAID NO.
 NO HE IS NOT.
 HE WANTS TO SEE HIM, BUT NOT
 TODAY.
 NOT TODAY, KRISTOFF.
 HE SAID, IT'S OK.
 HE'S COME TO TAKE ME FOR A WALK.
 DR. OZ: YOUR SON COMMITTED
 SUICIDE.
 HE BELIEVED HE HAD COME TO GET
 HIM.
 MIA: TO TAKE HIM FOR A WALK.
 SO I PANICKED.
 I WAS LIKE TWO HOURS AWAY.
 I DIDN'T KNOW IF I COULD GET TO
 HIM IN TIME.
 I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS GOING
 TO DO.
 I STARTED CALLING HIS FAMILY.
 HE WENT OVER THERE AND CALLED ME
 AND SAID, NO ONE IS ANSWERING
 THE DOOR.
 I SAID, BREAK OPEN THE DAMN
 DOOR.
 GETTING THAT HOUSE NOW.
 SO HE CALLED KRISTOFF'S SECOND
 EX-WIFE, BECAUSE SHE LIVED
 CLOSE, AND SHE GOT A KEY AND
 CAME AND OPENED THE DOOR, AND
 THEY FOUND HIM FACEDOWN.
 THEY TRIED TO REVIVE HIM.
 THEY CALLED 911.
 WHEN SHE CALLED TO TELL ME, IT
 WAS LIKE -- I JUST COULDN'T.
 I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.
 IT WAS LIKE MY SON ALL OVER
 AGAIN.
 DR. OZ: ACCORDING TO THE LOS
 ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT, A
 DEATH INVESTIGATION TOOK PLACE
 FOR A POSSIBLE ALCOHOL OVERDOSE.
 THE CAUSE OF DEATH HAS BEEN
 DEFERRED PENDING ADDITIONAL
 RESULTS.
 ALCOHOL CAN KILL YOU, BUT OTHER
 MEANS CAN AS WELL.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK REALLY
 HAPPENED TO KRISTOFF?
 MIA: I WANT TO BELIEVE THAT IT
 WAS AN ALCOHOL ACCIDENTAL
 OVERDOSE.
 DR. OZ: HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO
 STAY SOBER?
 MIA: YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY NO.
 I LOST MY 30 YEARS.
 BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, I JUST, I'M
 NOT GIVING UP.
 SO I START OVER AGAIN.
 I PICKED MYSELF BACK UP, AND I'M
 GOING TO CONTINUE MY PATH FOR
 BETTER MENTAL HEALTH IN THIS
 COUNTRY.
 I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO FIGHT
 FOR IT.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT.
 BOTH OF YOUR BOYS, YOU COULD
 ARGUE, WHERE FAILED BY THE
 HEALTH CARE SYSTEM.
 MIA: DEFINITELY.
 DEFINITELY.
 ULTIMATE FAILURE.
 AND IF I JUST SIT AND DO
 NOTHING, TO ME, THAT WOULD BE A
 CRIME.
 DR. OZ: YOU CAN CHANGE THE WORLD

 WHAT IS HIS LEGACY?
 MIA: I JUST WANT PEOPLE TO
 REMEMBER HIM FOR HOW FUNNY AND
 SWEET HE WAS.
 PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS, BUT
 BEFORE HE PASSED -- I WORKED
 WITH HOMELESS YOUNG ADULTS AND
 HE CAME TO THE SHELTER AND GAVE
 FREE ACTING CLASSES TO
 EVERYBODY.
 THAT IS JUST HOW HE WAS.
 I SAID, YOU ONLY HAVE TO SPEND
 AN HOUR HERE.
 HE SPENT THE WHOLE DAY.
 HE WAS A GOOD PERSON.
 DR. OZ: THE ULTIMATE LEGACY, TO
 LEAVE BEHIND PEOPLE WHO LOVE YOU
 BECAUSE YOU WERE KIND.
 THANK YOU.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.


 DR. OZ: NEXT, THE CRAZY TEXT MESSAGES YOU HAVE TO READ.

     Surviving for five years          is a big deal.

 [APPLAUSE] DR. OZ: THEY ARE ALL ABOUT
 TEXTING THESE DAYS, WHETHER IT
 IS A QUICK HELLO OR QUESTION,
 SOMETIMES A RANDOM EMOJI, OR
 SOME HEALTH ADVICE.
 TODAY WE ARE EXPOSING THE
 CRAZIEST TEXT MESSAGE
 CONVERSATIONS THAT YOU HAVE TO
 SEE TO BELIEVE.
 LIKE THIS ONE.
 I CUT MY FINGER ON THE
 BLENDER.
 CAN I STILL DRINK THE SMOOTHIE?
 DR. OZ: THAT IS A HARD ONE.
 SOMEONE IN THE AUDIENCE IS
 NOTORIOUS FOR SENDING THESE
 TYPES OF TEXT.
 WHO BRAVELY VOLUNTEERED THIS
 TEXT?
 WOULD YOU STILL LOVE ME IF MY
 BACK FUNGUS ATTACKED YOU IN YOUR
 SLEEP?
 THERE HE IS.
 ROSS, HOW ARE YOU?
 WELCOME TO THE SHOW.
 A VERY BRAVE MAN.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: I'VE SEEN TEXTS LIKE
 THAT ALL THE TIME IN MY FAMILY,
 BUT YOU WENT ONE STEP FURTHER.
 WE BOTH TRAVEL FOR WORK A LOT
 THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.
 WE ARE APART DURING THE WEEKS.
 I GET TEXT MESSAGES FROM SARAH.
 SOMETIMES I WORRY, BUT SHE'S A
 LITTLE OVERDRAMATIC ABOUT MINOR
 THINGS LIKE COCKROACHES OR
 APPARENTLY THIS.
 SHE'S A GOOD SPORT, SO I WANTED
 TO BRING HER OUT HERE.
 DR. OZ: SO I THOUGHT WE WOULD DO
 TWO THINGS.
 I'M GOING TO HELP YOU WITH THAT
 PROBLEM YOU WERE COMPLAINING
 ABOUT, BUT THIS IS ANOTHER TEXT.
 I READ THIS TO MY WIFE LAST
 NIGHT.
 SHE GOT A KICK OUT OF IT.
 I THOUGHT YOU COULD RECONNECT IT
 FOR US.
 SOS, WE ARE NEVER HAVING
 KIDS.
 DID YOU KNOW YOU POO WHILE YOU
 ARE GIVING BIRTH?
 ARE YOU SERIOUS?
 APPARENTLY IT IS SOMETHING
 EVERYONE BUT ME SEEMS TO KNOW.
 MAYBE IT IS SOME SECRET THAT
 PARENTS KEEP THE TRIP THERE KIDS
 INTO HAVING KIDS.
 THAT IS HILARIOUS, BUT SOUNDS
 LIKE A SMALL PRICE TO PAY FOR
 HAVING A KID.
 EASY FOR HIM TO SAY.
 DR. OZ: SO GIVE ME THE BACK
 STORY ON THIS MESSAGE THAT YOU
 TEXTED HIM THAT GOT YOU ON THIS
 SHOW.
 WOULD YOU STILL LOVE ME IF MY
 BACK FUNGUS ATTACKED YOU IN YOUR
 SLEEP?
 SOMETHING WAS GOING ON HERE.
 IT REALLY IS NOT SOME SEXY
 FUNGUS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE.
 IT WAS JUST THESE SPOTS ON MY
 BACK.
 DR. OZ: HERE IS WHAT THE RASH
 LOOK LIKE.
 THIS IS WHEN MY FRIEND
 NOTICED IT.
 I THOUGHT NOTHING OF IT AFTER
 THE DRAMATIC TEXT.
 MY FRIEND SAID SHE KNEW WHAT IT
 WAS BECAUSE ONE OF HER FRIENDS
 EXPERIENCED IT.
 SO I GOT IT CHECKED OUT.
 IT WAS OK.
 DR. OZ: DID THEY TELL YOU IT WAS

 THAT IS WHAT THEY SAID.
 DR. OZ: THAT IS FROM A FUNGUS
 THAT IS VERY BENIGN.
 IT GROWS MORE IN SOME PEOPLE
 THAN OTHERS.
 YOU ARE JUST KEEPING IT DRY,
 MAYBE ANTIFUNGAL CREAM.
 THEY GAVE ME A SHAMPOO TO PUT
 ON.
 DR. OZ: DID IT EVER ATTACK ROSS?
 I DON'T KNOW.
 DID IT?
 IT DID NOT.
 DR. OZ: NOT YET.
 HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN MARRIED?
 A YEAR AND A HALF.
 DR. OZ: KEEP SENDING THE TEXT.
 GOOD LUCK WITH BABIES.
 WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
 [APPLAUSE]

 DR. OZ: NEXT, OUR ADDICTED SERIES CONTINUES.

 PHONE?
 [APPLAUSE] DR. OZ: WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT
 ADDICTION WITH TEXTING.
 EVERY MINUTE AND ESTIMATED 15
 MILLION TEXT MESSAGES ARE SENT
 AROUND THE WORLD.
 PART OF A BIGGER HEALTH PROBLEM
 I THINK EVERY ONE OF US MAY BE
 DEALING WITH TO SOME DEGREE.
 CELL PHONE ADDICTION.
 HERE'S MY AUDIENCE, COOKED TO
 THEIR PHONES BEFORE THE SHOW.
 WE ARE ALL GUILTY OF IT.
 WE GET THAT URGE TO LOOK AT
 FACEBOOK, INSTAGRAM, 10 TIMES AN
 HOUR.
 IN THE MIDDLE OF A CONVERSATION,
 WE CHECK OUR EMAIL OR SEND A
 TEXT, WATCH VIDEO, TAKE SELFIES.
 WE GET LOST FOR HOURS, HOPED
 LIKE ZOMBIES.
 IT IS TIME WE ALL TAKE A LOOK TO
 SEE IF WE ARE ADDICTED.
 THINK OF IT AS A WAKE-UP CALL.
 AN ESTIMATED 270 MILLION
 AMERICANS OWN SMARTPHONES.
 STATISTICS SHOW WE ARE SPENDING
 MORE TIME ON THEM THAN EVER.
 CHECKING THEM AN AVERAGE 52
 TIMES A DAY AND OVER ONE THIRD
 OF US LABEL OUR SMARTPHONE USE
 AS EXCESSIVE.
 BUT COULD THIS HIGH TECH TREND
 COME AT A COST TO OUR MENTAL AND
 PHYSICAL HEALTH, AND OUR IN
 PERSON RELATIONSHIPS?
 IT IS A REAL WORRY FOR BELINDA,
 WHO HAS BEEN MARRIED TO ERIC FOR
 15 YEARS.
 MAYBE AROUND THE 11TH YEAR OF
 OUR MARRIAGE, DURING OUR DATE
 NIGHT, HE STARTED SPENDING A LOT
 OF TIME ON HIS PHONE, NOT BEING
 ENGAGED AND GIVING ME HIS FULL
 ATTENTION.
 HE WAS STILL WORKING.
 EMAILS, PHONE CALLS, VIDEOS,
 DOING HIS PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT
 DURING OUR TIME.
 I DON'T LIKE TO REPEAT MY
 CONVERSATION OVER AND OVER.
 HERE'S WHAT I DO KNOW.
 I AM NOT ADDICTED TO MY PHONE.
 I AM A COACH.
 I AM A SINGER.
 NO ADDICTION.
 DR. OZ: BELINDA DISAGREES.
 IT DOESN'T MATTER IF WE ARE
 AT DINNER, AT THE GYM, GOING
 SHOPPING, BEFORE A PLAY,
 WHEREVER WE ARE, HE HAS THAT
 PHONE IN HIS HAND AND HE'S
 ENGAGED IN IT.
 DR. OZ: BELINDA AND HER HUSBAND
 ARE JOINING US NOW.
 HOW MANY HOURS A DAY DO YOU
 THINK THIS WONDERFUL MAN USES
 HIS CELL PHONE?
 AT LEAST 14.
 DR. OZ: WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT
 THAT?
 YOU USE YOUR PHONE 14 HOURS A
 DAY?
 NO.
 NOT AT ALL.
 WHO COULD BE ON THE PHONE 14
 HOURS A DAY?
 I'M A STYLIST AND A SINGER.
 NO.
 14 HOURS A DAY.
 DR. OZ: I CAN ATTEST TO WOMEN.
 THEY TELL ME THE TRUTH.
 WE GOT 14 HOURS, WE DON'T THINK
 IT IS 14, BUT HOW MANY HOURS?
 MAYBE SIX.
 DR. OZ: DO YOU THINK -- NO, I
 DON'T.
 DR. OZ: THERE HAVE BEEN FISSURES
 IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP.
 FOR EXAMPLE?
 WHEN EVER WE ARE DOING
 SOMETHING THAT WE SET OUT FOR
 OUR TIME, HE'S ENGAGED IN THE
 PHONE.
 DR. OZ: DO YOU THINK SHE'S RIGHT
 TO BE A LITTLE ANGRY?
 I THINK SHE HAS A RIGHT TO BE
 ANGRY OR DISAPPOINTED.
 IF THAT WERE THE TRUTH.
 DR. OZ: BUT YOU DON'T THINK IT
 IS AN ISSUE.
 OK, JUST FOR NOW, I THINK A LOT
 OF US ARE RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE.
 I'M NOT QUITE SURE.
 I KNOW I'M USING IT A LOT.
 I DON'T KNOW IF I'M INTERFERING
 WITH PEOPLE AROUND ME.
 WHAT YOU JUST SAID, THAT HAPPENS
 ALL THE TIME.
 I HAVE DEVON AND MACKENZIE IN
 THE AUDIENCE.
 THEY ARE BEST FRIENDS.
 THEY ARE CONSTANTLY ARGUING OVER
 CELL PHONE USE.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: MACKENZIE, WHAT IS SAM
 DOING THAT IS BOTHERING YOU?
 SAM IS ALWAYS ON HER PHONE.
 DOESN'T MATTER IF WE ARE AT
 LUNCH, DINNER, GETTING DRINKS.
 SHE'S ALWAYS ON HER PHONE.
 IT IS NOT JUST ME THAT SEES THIS
 AS A PROBLEM.
 IT IS ALSO HER KIDS, HER FAMILY.
 IT GOT SO BAD, I HAD TO TAKE THE
 PHONE AWAY.
 DR. OZ: YOU IMPOUNDED THE PHONE.
 SAM, DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE A
 PROBLEM?
 I DON'T THINK I HAVE AN
 ADDICTION.
 I USE MY CELL PHONE A LOT FOR
 WORK.
 IT IS IMPERATIVE AS AN EVENT
 PLANNER.
 I RUN SEVERAL FACEBOOK AND
 INSTAGRAM PAGES AND I HAVE TO
 CONNECT WITH MY EMPLOYEES.
 I DON'T REALLY THINK IT IS A
 PROBLEM.
 DR. OZ: IF IT IS A PROBLEM, AND
 I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A QUIZ TO
 FIND OUT IF WE GOT AN ISSUE, ARE
 YOU WILLING TO GET HELP?
 DEFINITELY.
 DR. OZ: YOU CARE ABOUT THE
 PEOPLE IN YOUR LIVES.
 LIGHT.
 DR. OZ: WE HAVE TWO OF THE
 WORLD'S LEADING EXPERTS ON CELL
 PHONE ADDICTION.
 DR. DAVID GREENFIELD IS A
 MEDICAL PSYCHOLOGIST.
 CATHERINE PRICE IS A SCIENCE
 JOURNALIST AND THE AUTHOR OF HOW
 TO BREAK UP WITH YOUR PHONE.
 DR. GREENFIELD BELIEVES WE ARE
 SPENDING TIME ON OUR CELL PHONE
 AND THAT IS HAVING A BAD EFFECT
 ON OUR BODIES.
 DR. GREENFIELD: THE IDEA IS THAT
 WHEN YOU USE YOUR SMART PHONE,
 YOU ARE ELEVATING DOPAMINE,
 WHICH IS A PLEASURE CHEMICAL.
 AT THE SAME TIME, YOU ARE
 ELEVATING CORTISOL, WHICH IS A
 STRESS HORMONE.
 IT LEAVES YOU FEELING DEPLETED
 AND DISCONNECTED AND UNHAPPY.
 DR. OZ: WHAT IS HAPPENING TO OUR
 ATTENTION SPAN?
 WHAT IS HAPPENING TO OUR FOCUS?
 CATHERINE: THE PHONES ARE HAVING
 A HUGE EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO
 STAY FOCUSED.
 WE ARE NOT DOING ONE THING ON
 THE PHONE.
 WE ARE DOING APPS, SOCIAL MEDIA,
 ALL THESE THINGS.
 EVERY TIME YOU DO THAT, YOU ARE
 CHANGING YOUR BRAIN.
 THAT HAS IMPACTS ON
 PRODUCTIVITY.
 STUDIES SHOW THAT HAVING THE
 PHONE NEARBY CAN MAKE IT MORE
 DIFFICULT TO COMPLETE A TASK.
 THEY ARE ALSO DISTRACTING US
 FROM OUR EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT,
 WHICH NOT ONLY TAKES AWAY FROM
 OUR EXPERIENCE OF OUR LIVES, BUT
 CAN HAVE HARM TO US.
 I WAS ONCE WALKING DOWN THE
 STREET LOST IN MY PHONE I DID
 NOT SEE A MAN COMING TOWARD ME
 WITH A GUN.
 I WAS MUGGED FOR MY PHONE.
 THERE'S MANY WAYS IN WHICH THEY
 ARE AFFECTING OUR LIVES.
 DR. OZ: ARE YOU OK, ERIC?
 THAT SWITCHED IT.
 DR. OZ: SO YOU'VE GOT A CELL
 PHONE COMPULSION QUIZ.
 ARE YOU COMPULSIVELY USING IT?
 YOU CAN ALL TAKE IT.
 PLUS, A SIMPLE TRICK THAT WILL
 HELP YOU BREAK THIS ADDICTION,
 NEXT.

       <i> a super-smooth</i>       <i> dairy alternative.</i>
 DR. OZ: WE ARE BACK, TALKING ABOUT A PROBLEM WE JOKE ABOUT,
 BUT IT IS QUITE SERIOUS.
 CELL PHONE ADDICTION.
 BELINDA AND ERIC ARE CONSTANTLY
 FIGHTING OVER HIS CELL PHONE
 USE.
 MACKENZIE AND SAM ARE DEALING
 WITH THE SAME ISSUE.
 ARE YOU READY FOR SOME HELP?
 THE FIRST PART IS TO FIGURE OUT
 IF YOU NEED IT.
 WHICH WE HAVE A DEBATE OVER NOW.
 ERIC SAYS HE IS BUSY WORKING ALL
 DAY LONG.
 SAM, YOU ARE SAYING YOU HAVE TO
 DO YOUR WORK.
 WE HAVE TWO OF THE WORLD'S
 LEADING EXPERTS HERE.
 CATHERINE PRICE IS BACK AND DR.
 DAVID GREENFIELD, WHO HAS
 CREATED A CELL PHONE COMPULSION
 TEST.
 DURING THE BREAK, OUR GUESTS AND
 THE ENTIRE STUDIO AUDIENCE TOOK
 THIS TEST.
 YOU CAN FIND IT ON DOCTOROZ.COM.
 I URGE YOU TO GIVE IT TO PEOPLE
 IN YOU LIFE WHO YOU THINK ARE
 ADDICTED TO THEIR CELL PHONES.
 FIVE QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW.
 FIRST QUESTION, DO YOU SLEEP
 WITH YOUR PHONE TURNED ON UNDER
 YOUR PILLOW OR NEXT TO YOUR BED?
 ONLY YOU KNOW THE TRUTH.
 WHAT IS THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT
 QUESTION?
 DR. GREENFIELD: WHEN YOU HAVE
 THE PHONE NEXT TO YOU, IF IT IS
 IN YOUR SITE, YOUR CORTISOL
 LEVELS ARE GOING TO BE RAISED.
 THAT IS GOING TO WORK
 ANTITHETICAL HE TO YOUR DESIRE
 TO FEEL SLEEPY.
 IT IS GOING TO SCREW UP YOUR
 CIRCADIAN RHYTHM.
 DR. OZ: DO YOU TEXT OR EMAIL
 WHILE DRIVING OR DOING OTHER
 ACTIVITIES THAT REQUIRE
 CONCENTRATION?
 WHEN YOU EAT, IS YOUR CELL PHONE
 ALWAYS PARKED ON THE TABLE PLACE
 SETTING?
 IN THE RESTAURANTS WE SEE IT A
 LOT.
 DO YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE WHEN
 YOU ACCIDENTALLY LEAVE YOUR
 PHONE IN THE CAR OR AT HOME AND
 HAVE NO SERVICE?
 AND FINALLY, DO YOU MINDLESSLY
 CHECK YOUR CELL PHONE MANY TIMES
 A DAY, EVEN WHEN THERE IS
 NOTHING NEW TO SEE?
 I WANT TO KNOW, HOW MANY OF YOU
 ANSWERED YES TO MOST OF THESE
 QUESTIONS?
 OH MY GOODNESS.
 LIKE 90% OF THE AUDIENCE.
 THAT IS UNBELIEVABLE.
 WHAT DOES IT MEAN THAT YOU ARE
 ANSWERING THREE OR MORE OF THOSE
 FIVE QUESTIONS?
 DR. GREENFIELD: AS YOU SAW, I
 RAISED MY OWN HAND.
 MOST OF US CAN PROBABLY ANSWER
 THESE QUESTIONS POSITIVELY.
 IT PROBABLY JUST MEANS YOU NEED
 TO LOOK AT YOUR USE AND EXAMINE
 IT.
 WE ARE USING OUR PHONES
 MINDLESSLY AND WITHOUT
 AWARENESS.
 THE IDEA IS TO BECOME AWARE OF
 OUR USED PATTERNS.
 DR. OZ: ERIC, DID YOUR HAND GO
 OF?
 YES.
 DR. OZ: I THOUGHT SO.
 IT WAS UP AFTER THE FIRST PAGE.
 I WASN'T GOING TO SAY
 ANYTHING.
 DR. OZ: ON NATIONAL TELEVISION.
 AND SAM, DID YOUR HAND GO UP?
 IT DID.
 DR. OZ: I THOUGHT SO.
 LET'S GO THROUGH SOME SIMPLE
 STEPS WE CAN DO RIGHT NOW TO CUT
 DOWN ON OUR CELL PHONE USE.
 THE FIRST THING WE ARE GOING TO
 DO IS, YOU KNOW IT IS SO
 BEAUTIFUL AND COLORFUL.
 TURN IT TO BLACK AND WHITE.
 WHY DOES THAT WORK?
 CATHERINE: THE OVERALL POINT IS
 TO MAKE YOUR PHONE A TOOL, NOT A
 TEMPTATION.
 IT IS HELPFUL BECAUSE WE ARE
 ATTRACTED TO BRIGHT COLORS.
 YOU CAN LOOK IN THE PHONE
 SETTINGS OR DO AN INTERNET
 SEARCH FOR YOUR MODEL TO FIGURE
 OUT HOW TO DO IT.
 ANOTHER THING I RECOMMEND IS,
 TAKE YOUR TEMPTING APPS, SOCIAL
 MEDIA, NEWS, PUT THEM IN A
 FOLDER.
 MAKE YOUR PHONE AS BORING AS
 POSSIBLE.
 DR. OZ: FANTASTIC.
 THE FINAL TIP IS TO TURN OFF AS
 MANY NOTIFICATIONS AS POSSIBLE.
 I THINK THIS IS THE MOST
 IMPORTANT.
 IN MY OWN PERSONAL LIFE, IT HAS
 BEEN IMPACTFUL.
 DR. GREENFIELD: NOTIFICATIONS
 ARE THE KEY.
 THE SMARTPHONE IS THE WORLD'S
 SMALLEST SLOT MACHINE.
 EVERY TIME YOU CHECK YOUR PHONE,
 YOU GET A HINT OF DOPAMINE.
 NOTIFICATIONS LET YOU KNOW THAT
 THE DRUG IS THERE.
 THIS IS SUCH A BIG ISSUE.
 WE ARE ABOUT TO OPEN A PROGRAM
 FOR PEOPLE ADDICTED TO THIS
 SCREEN.
 DR. OZ: AN INPATIENT ADDICTION
 CENTER FOR ADDICTS?
 DR. GREENFIELD: YES.
 DR. OZ: DO YOU FEEL ANY OF THESE
 TOOLS MIGHT COME IN HANDY FOR
 YOU?
 YES.
 [LAUGHTER]
 DR. OZ: WELL, BELINDA --
 WHERE IS THE PLACE?
 IS IT GOING TO BE REALLY NICE?
 AND WHERE IS THE LADY THAT TOOK
 MY CELL PHONE?
 [LAUGHTER]
 DR. GREENFIELD: YOU ARE WATCHING
 THAT, WAITING FOR THAT.
 DR. OZ: I DIDN'T GET ANYTHING
 FROM YOU.
 WHAT IS GOING DOWN, ERIC?
 IN MY DEFENSE, MY WIFE HAS
 CELL PHONE, LAPTOP, TABLET, AND
 DESKTOP.
 I ONLY HAVE MY PHONE, WHICH IS
 USED FOR ALL OF THAT.
 BUT OF COURSE I'M A MAN AND SHE
 IS RIGHT.
 [LAUGHTER]
 DR. OZ: THANK YOU.
 I LOVE IT.
 [APPLAUSE]
 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
 DR. OZ: WHEN I FIRST GOT
 MARRIED, MY FATHER-IN-LAW TOLD
 ME TO GET INTO MY WIFE ON THE
 SMALL THINGS, BECAUSE WHEN THE
 BIG DECISIONS CAME UP, I NEEDED
 TO KNOW WHAT IT FELT LIKE.
 I WASN'T GETTING THOSE EITHER.
 WHAT ABOUT YOU GUYS?
 THE THOUGHT OF ACTUALLY GOING
 TO A REHAB FREAKS ME OUT.
 BUT I WANT TO GIVE MORE TIME TO
 MY FAMILY AND MY KIDS SO I'M
 DEFINITELY GOING TO USE THOSE
 TIPS.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: GOOD FOR YOU.
 NICE JOB, MACKENZIE.
 THANKS TO ALL OF YOU.
 WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
 [APPLAUSE]

 DR. OZ: STAY TUNED FOR ANOTHER INSTALLMENT OF OUR ADDICTED
 SERIES.
 THIS TIME, PERMANENT MAKEUP.
 WOMEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE
 GETTING PROCEDURES WEAR MAKEUP
 IS PERMANENTLY PUT ON THEIR
 FACE.
  PERMANENTLY PUT ON THEIR

            But, really
      I'm struggling to keep      up this brave face
        to hide my symptoms        of depression.
    I'm taking my antidepressant,         like we discussed.
               But, I'm still               feeling depressed.
          Is it just me?
    Doctor: It's not just you.
      Two out of three people      on antidepressants
       may still experience symptoms.
 When added to an  antidepressant,
 REXULTI has been proven
     to help reduce symptoms of depression.
      Woman:      So I can stay on my      current antidepressant
         and help build on      the progress I've made.
                       Hey, guys.

   <i> REXULTI is not for everyone.</i>
      <i> Call your doctor about</i>   <i> unusual changes in behavior,</i>
      <i> worsening depression,</i>      <i> or thoughts of suicide.</i>
        <i> Antidepressants</i>        <i> can increase these</i>
     <i> in those 24 and younger.</i>
         <i> Elderly dementia</i>     <i> patients taking REXULTI</i>
      <i> have an increased risk</i>      <i> of death or stroke.</i>
       <i> Call your doctor if</i>       <i> you have high fever,</i>
   <i> stiff muscles, and confusion</i>
    <i> to address a possible</i>    <i> life-threatening condition</i>
  <i> or if you have uncontrollable</i>        <i> muscle movements,</i>
    <i> as these may be permanent.</i>
      <i> REXULTI has been shown</i>     <i> to increase blood sugar</i>
         <i> in some people.</i>
    <i> Other risks are increased</i>    <i> cholesterol; weight gain;</i>
          <i> unusual urges</i>     <i> or compulsive behaviors;</i>
   <i> decreased white blood cells,</i>      <i> which can be serious;</i>
      <i> dizziness on standing;</i>  <i> seizures; trouble swallowing;</i>
       <i> and impaired judgment</i>       <i> or motor skills.</i>
      Now, I'm glad I talked          with my doctor
       about adding REXULTI.
        <i> Feel better about</i>        <i> facing the world.</i>

 RESULTS AND REGRETS.
 [APPLAUSE] DR. OZ: ALL WEEK LONG, WE'VE
 BEEN BRINGING YOU STORIES ABOUT
 ADDICTION.
 TODAY, A TREND THAT HAS GROWN IN
 POPULARITY, PERMANENT MAKEUP.
 MY TEAM RESEARCH ON INSTAGRAM
 AND FOUND OVER 3 MILLION POSTS
 ABOUT PERMANENT MAKEUP TATTOOED
 ON EYEBROWS OR EYELIDS.
 THIS IS INK EMBEDDED INTO THE
 FACE.
 IT CAN LOOK NATURAL AS IF YOU'VE
 JUST APPLY MAKEUP IF IT IS DONE
 RIGHT.
 BUT NOT EVERYONE HAS BEEN SO
 LUCKY.
 SOME WOMEN HAVE BEEN BOTCHED.
 LOOK AT THIS ONE.
 THE ARTIST DREW THE EYEBROWS
 BADLY.
 YOU DON'T NORMALLY HAVE TWO
 PAIRS OF DUPLICATE EYEBROWS.
 THIS ONE, THE PERMANENT EYELINER
 IS DISCOLORED.
 YOU ARE BETTER OFF DOING IT
 YOURSELF.
 AND THESE LIPS LOOK TO BE
 INFECTED TO ME.
 DEFINITELY NOT FILLED IN
 PROPERLY.
 INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER TIA BROWN
 IS HERE WITH MORE.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: I LOOK AT THESE PICTURES
 AND I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW THESE
 PEOPLE GOT HURT.
 WHAT IS PERMANENT MAKEUP?
 TIA: IT IS BASICALLY A TATTOO ON
 YOUR FACE.
 WE ARE SEEING PEOPLE GETTING IT
 ON THEIR EYE LINE, THEIR
 EYEBROWS.
 THEY WANT TO HAVE THAT FRESH
 MADE UP LOOK ALL THE TIME.
 PEOPLE ARE GETTING IT ON THEIR
 EYEBROWS.
 THEY EVEN GET IT ON THEIR LIPS.
 THAT IS THE EYELINER RIGHT
 THERE.
 BEAUTICIANS DO IT.
 THE BOTTOM LINE IS IT IS
 SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE ARE DOING
 FOR VANITY.
 DR. OZ: ARE THERE DANGERS?
 I JUST SAW SOME OF THE COSMETIC
 COMPLICATIONS.
 TIA: THERE'S A BIG COMPLICATION,
 INFECTION.
 YOU CAN GET INFECTIONS.
 YOU CAN GET SCARRING.
 THAT IS A BIG DEAL.
 PEOPLE ARE USING DIRTY NEEDLES.
 THEY ARE NOT DEALING WITH
 LICENSED PROFESSIONALS.
 IT IS NOT SOMETHING TO PLAY
 WITH.
 DR. OZ: THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
 GETTING MAKEUP THAT IS PERMANENT
 AND GETTING A TATTOO.
 I'VE BEEN CURIOUS FOR A WHILE.
 WHEN YOU GET PERMANENT MAKEUP,
 THERE'S A ROTARY MACHINE.
 A NEEDLE GOES BENEATH THE
 EPIDERMIS, ONE LAYER BELOW TO
 THE DERMIS.
 SEE THAT?
 WHEN YOU GO THERE, YOU CAN LEAVE
 PIGMENT THAT CAN LAST UP TO FIVE
 YEARS.
 WHEN YOU GET A TATTOO, A LITTLE
 DIFFERENT.
 A TATTOO NEEDLE, TECHNICIANS USE
 A COILED MACHINE WITH A BIGGER
 NEEDLE, AND THAT NEEDLE GOES
 DEEPLY INTO THE HYPO DERMIS.
 BENEATH THE SUPERFICIAL LAYER.
 IT GOES LOWER INTO THE SKIN.
 FOR THAT REASON, IT SHOULD LAST
 A LIFETIME.
 BOTH TECHNIQUES ARE SORT OF
 PERMANENT, IDEALLY.
 ON THE MAKEUP SIDE, FIVE YEARS
 TO ME IS PERMANENT.
 THE QUESTION IS, ARE YOU GETTING
 THESE PROCEDURES DONE BY THE
 RIGHT PEOPLE AT THE RIGHT PLACE?
 LET ME SHOW YOU A PICTURE OF
 SOMEONE WHO HAS A REGRET.
 THIS IS VICTORIA.
 SHE DECIDED TO GET A PERMANENT
 EYEBROW DONE.
 IT ENDED UP LOOKING LIKE THIS.
 HER BROWS LOOK SOMEWHAT MAGENTA
 COLORED WHICH IS NOT WHAT SHE
 DESIRED.
 LUCKILY SHE WAS ABLE TO GET THEM
 CORRECTED AND SHE IS JOINING US
 TO TELL HER STORY.
 HOW ARE YOU?
 THANKS FOR THE SUNGLASSES TO
 CAMOUFLAGE YOU.
 I WOULD LOVE TO SEE WHAT YOUR
 BROWS LOOK LIKE NOW.
 YOU BET.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: OH.
 WELL CONGRATULATIONS.
 BEFORE I GET TO HAVE YOU FIXED
 THEM, WHY DID YOU CHOOSE TO GET
 PERMANENT MAKEUP IN THE FIRST
 PLACE?
 UNFORTUNATELY I WAS NOT
 BLESSED WITH BEAUTIFUL BUSHY
 BROWS.
 MY EYEBROWS ARE COMPLETELY
 BLONDE SINCE THE DAY I WAS BORN.
 AND SO EVERY DAY I WOULD HAVE TO
 PUT ON MAKEUP TO EVEN GIVE
 MYSELF THE EFFECT OF HAVING A
 BROW.
 DR. OZ: WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU
 WENT TO GET THE PERMANENT
 EYEBROWS DONE?
 I HAVE RESEARCHED THIS
 PERMANENT MAKEUP ARTIST.
 I HAD LOOKED AT HER REVIEWS
 ONLINE.
 I HAD LOOKED AT THE BEFORE AND
 AFTER.
 SHE WAS A SEEMINGLY REPUTABLE
 ARTIST.
 DR. OZ: WHEN DO YOU REALIZE
 SOMETHING WAS WRONG ESTON MARK
 -- WRONG?
 I REALIZED THE INK COLOR SHE
 HAD CHOSEN WAS OBVIOUSLY WRONG
 FOR MY FACE.
 I WAS MORTIFIED.
 DR. OZ: ANY BOTCHED PROCEDURE IS
 A NIGHTMARE, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE
 EVIDENCE IS ON YOUR FACE.
 WERE YOU ABLE TO FIND SOMEONE TO
 FIX THE PROBLEM?
 YOU LOOK SO MUCH BETTER.
 YOU STREAMED THE PROCEDURE LIVE
 ON FACEBOOK.
 HOW DOES IT FEEL TO HAVE YOUR
 EYEBROWS LOOK THE WAY YOU WANT
 THEM TO?
 I WAS GRATEFUL THAT ANYBODY
 WOULD TOUCH THEM.
 I CONTACTED PROFESSIONALS IN NEW
 YORK AND CALIFORNIA AND ASKED
 AND THEY SAID THEY WOULDN'T
 TOUCH THEM FOR UP TO A YEAR
 BECAUSE OF THE INK THAT WAS IN
 MY SKIN.
 THEY WERE WORRIED IT WOULD HAVE
 AN ADVERSE REACTION.
 I DID FIND A MAKEUP ARTIST OR A
 PERMANENT ARTIST HERE, BUT I
 TOLD HER I WOULD SIGN AWAY ANY
 DISCLAIMERS, BUT I WOULD BE OK
 WITH GRAY EYEBROWS OVER RED.
 I WAS SEEING UNICORN EYEBROWS.
 I EVEN HAD PEOPLE ASK IF I HAD
 CANCER BECAUSE THEY LOOKED SO
 INAPPROPRIATE ON MY FACE.
 DR. OZ: WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU
 GIVE TO SOMEONE THINKING ABOUT
 PERMANENT MAKEUP?
 ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS
 I'VE LEARNED IS TO NOT JUST LOOK
 FOR BEFORE AND AFTER.
 GO BACK FOR A ONE-MONTH TOUCHUP
 ALWAYS.
 LOOK FOR THAT FOLLOW-UP AFTER
 THE ONE-MONTH TOUCHUP.
 LOOK FOR SOMEONE THAT HAS THREE
 PICTURES.
 BEFORE, AFTER, AND THE
 FOLLOW-UP.
 DR. OZ: THANK YOU FOR SHARING
 YOUR STORY.
 I'M GLAD IT FINALLY WORKED OUT.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: TINA WANTED TO
 INVESTIGATE FURTHER.
 SHE MADE AN APPOINTMENT AT ONE
 OF THESE CLINICS FOR A
 CONSULTATION.

     Our grandparents checked        their smartphones
        zero times a day.
          Times change.          Eyes haven't.
   That's why there's Ocuvite.
         Screen light...
           Sunlight...
         Longer hours...
 Eyes today are stressed.
      But Ocuvite has vital           nutrients...
     ...to help protect them.
             Ocuvite.     Eye nutrition for today.
    The in-laws have moved in    with us.
 And our adult children are here.
    So we save by using Tide.
     Which means we use less.
   Three generations of clothes   cleaned in one wash.
      Anybody seen my pants?
  <i> #1 stain and odor fighter, #1</i>  <i> trusted.</i>
       <i> It's got to be Tide.</i>
 Is your dry skin cream not doing             enough?
   Try Eucerin Advanced Repair              cream.
  For 48hour dry skin relief...
    Goes beyond ceramides with       moisturizing factors
    naturally found in skin...
  Eucerin Advanced Repair Cream
   For healthier looking skin.
    (Cat 1) Friskies World...
       (Cat 2) Smell that?
          (Cat 1) Gravy!
 (Cat 2) That's not gravy, that's extra gravy.
          (Cat 1) Whoa!
  (Cat 2) That's Friskies  Extra Gravy! Paté and Chunky!
    (Cat 1) Gravy purr-adise.
   (Cat 2) Purr-adise? Really?
    (VO) Feed Their Fantasy.    Friskies.
       You're not just Mom
     you're her whole world.
    Don't just get away, come            together.


             Babybel: That snack just sounded boring.
        Babybel:        Coming through.        No photos, please.
             Babybel:         Bye bye, bland.
             Babybel:       Helloooo, delicious.

                        Babybel:                        Saved it!
 TIA: I'VE BEEN DOING RESEARCH ON PERMANENT MAKEUP.
 YOU CAN GET YOUR LIPS, YOUR EYE
 LINE, EVEN YOUR EYEBROWS.
 BUT YOU CAN ALSO GET SCARRED FOR
 LIFE.
 I DECIDED TO CHECK OUT A FEW
 PLACES.
 I'M ABOUT TO GO IN.
 I'M BACK.
 EVERYTHING I ASKED, SHE HAD AN
 ANSWER FOR.
 SHE HAD CERTIFICATION.
 SHE TOLD ME THE PRICE WAS $500
 FOR THE FIRST VISIT.
 $120 FOR EVERY FOLLOW-UP.
 SHE EVEN SAID AFTERCARE AND MY
 HEALTH WAS ON ME.
 THE BIGGEST THING, SHE SAID I
 COULD COME BACK TOMORROW AND GET
 MY LIPS, BROWSE, OR EYE LINE
 DONE.
 I'M NOT SURE I'M READY FOR THAT
 COMMITMENT.
 [APPLAUSE]
 DR. OZ: THAT WAS TIA GOING FOR A
 CONSULTATION TO GET PERMANENT
 MAKEUP.
 WERE THERE ANY RED FLAGS?
 TIA: I THINK THE BIGGEST THING
 IS THAT THERE'S THIS RUSH TO
 COMMIT.
 YOU SHOP AROUND FOR A CAR OR
 SHOES.
 PERMANENT MAKEUP HAS A LONG
 EFFECT ON YOUR LIFE.
 DON'T RUSH.
 DR. OZ: SO WE FOUND A CERTIFIED
 SPECIALIST IN THE CITY, ROCHELLE
 , WHO IS WORKING ON A CLIENT.
 WHAT SHOULD FOLKS BE LOOKING FOR
 WHEN THEY MEET SOMEONE LIKE YOU?
 ROCHELLE: FIRST THING YOU SHOULD
 DO IS DO YOUR RESEARCH.
 FIND SOMEONE THAT IS LICENSED,
 CERTIFIED.
 ASK FOR PHOTOS, BEFORE AND AFTER
 AS WELL.
 AND DON'T BE AFRAID TO ASK FOR A
 REFERRAL.
 DR. OZ: I SEE A FAIR AMOUNT OF
 EFFORT JUST PLANNING OUT WHAT
 YOU'RE GOING TO DO, LIKE A
 SURGEON.
 ROCHELLE: THIS IS WHAT WE DO.
 DR. OZ: YOU MUST SEE SOME
 COMPLICATIONS, BOTCHED JOBS.
 ROCHELLE: YES.
 WE HAVE QUITE A FEW THAT COME.
 PEOPLE ARE COMING IN FROM LAS
 VEGAS.
 THEY ASK US, AND YOU DO A
 CONSULTATION FOR CORRECTION?
 DR. OZ: I'LL LET YOU GET
 STARTED.
 IN THE MEANTIME, DO YOUR
 HOMEWORK.
 THIS IS FIVE YEARS OF LOOKING
 DIFFERENT.
 TOGETHER, CHANGE IS HAPPENING.
 OUR JOURNEY IS JUST BEGINNING.
 GOOD LUCK.

  Do you push through migraine?
     Mom, are you OK to play?
 Yeah honey, how about we play...
      princess and pirates?
   Imagine what you can do with   more migraine-free days.
             Arr!
            En garde!
     When you're not fighting     through migraine
    imagine the possibilities.
  Once-monthly Emgality is used  for the prevention
      of migraine in adults.
  It's specifically developed to  help give you
     more migraine-free days.
  With Emgality about 60% of  people had their migraine days
       cut in half or more.
 Do not use if you are allergic to Emgality or its ingredients.
   Emgality may cause allergic   reactions, such as
     itching, rash, hives and     trouble breathing,
 which can happen days after use.
 Call your doctor or get medical help right away
    if you have symptoms of an    allergic reaction.
       The most common side       effects include
    injection site reactions.
   What should we do tomorrow?
 Ask your doctor about Emgality.
