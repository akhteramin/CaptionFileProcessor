 COMMENTS BY OMAR ABOUT ISRAEL IN RECENT WEEKS HAVE BEEN
 PERCEIVED AS ANTI-SEMITIC.
 SPARKING A HOUSE RESOLUTION.
 CONDEMNING NOT ONLY
 ANTI-SEMITISM BUT ALL FORMS OF
 HATE.
 DO YOU THINK HOUSE DEMOCRATS
 WATERED IT DOWN?
 I DON'T THINK SO.
 I THINK IT WAS TO PROTECT --
 THEY'RE ALL --
 THEY HAVE BECOME THE PARTY OF
 INFANTE SIDE AND SOCIALISM.
 THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH SPEAKER
 PELOSI CAN DO.
 I THINK SHE HAS A DIFFERENT
 EXPERIENCE AND USE OF WORDS
 UNDERSTANDING SOME ARE FRAUGHT
 WITH MEANING SHE DOESN'T
 REALIZE.
 IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT WORDS
 MEAN CONGRESS MAY BE THE WRONG
 LINE OF WORK FOR YOU.
 COHEN SAYS IT'S MR. TRUMP
 THAT'S LYING.
 HARD TO SORTING THROUGH A HE
 SAID SHE SAID ARGUMENT.
 COHEN AND/OR HIS LAWYERS
 APPROACHED THE PRESIDENT AND
 ASKED FOR A PARDON.
 WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID --
 OKAY.
 THIS GUY ROUTINELY LIED.
 ANYTHING HE SAID THAT'S NOT
 DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE, UNLESS
 HE'S GETTING HIS TONGUE NOTE
 RIDE.
 IF HE'S BREATHING HE'S LIED.
 PROBABLY MADE OVER A THOUSAND
 FALSE STATEMENTS ABOUT THE
 RUSSIA ISSUES.
 DO YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT
 WILL AT SOME POINT PARDON PAUL
 MANAFORT?
 I DO THINK HIS SUPPORTERS
 THINK IT WILL BE EASY TO PARDON
 HIM.
 MR. MANAFORT IS A GRIFTER,
 WAS WITH MR. STONE.
 I'M SORRY.
 HE IS A SLEAZE --
 DEMOCRATS ARE HAVING A TOUGH
 TIME TRYING TO KEEP EVERYONE IN
 THEIR PARTY ON THIS SAME PAGE.
 THE INFIGHTING ON HANDLING
 REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR'S
 COMMENTS.
 SOME ON BOTH SIDES FOUND THIS TO
 BE ANTI-SEMITIC WHILE
 PROGRESSIVES DEFENDED IT AS
 REBUKE OF ISRAEL.
 A RESOLUTION THAT BROADLY
 CONDEMNS HATRED.
 BUT IT WAS CRITICIZED BY SOME
 BEING WATERED DOWN NOT GOING FAR
 ENOUGH IN REBUKING OMAR.
 JUST IN TONIGHT, JONATHAN SWAN
 REPORTS DURING A FRIDAY NIGHT
 MAR-A-LAGO SPEECH TO DONORS, THE
 PRESIDENT SAID DEMOCRATS HATE
 JEWISH PEOPLE.
 AND HIS SECURITY REQUIRED EVENTS
 ATTENDEES TO PUT THEIR CELL
 PHONES IN MAGNETIZED POUCHS
 UNTIL THEY LEFT THE CLUB.
 HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI
 TRIED TO HANDLE THE UNWIELDY
 DEBATE OVER THE COMMENTS?
 DO YOU THINK SHE UNDERSTANDS
 HER COMMENTS AND WHAT HAPPENS IF
 THIS HAPPENS AGAIN.
 FIRST, THANK YOU FOR THE
 QUESTION.
 I DON'T THINK THAT THE
 CONGRESSWOMAN PERHAPS
 APPRECIATES THE FULL WEIGHT HOW
 IT'S HEARD BY OTHER PEOPLE
 ALTHOUGH I DON'T BELIEVE IT WAS
 INTENDED IN AN ANTI-SEMITIC WAY.
 MEANWHILE, OMAR HAS BEEN
 UNWILLING TO ISSUE AND APOLOGY
 ABOUT HER LATEST COMMENTS AND
 DUCKED QUESTIONS ABOUT THEM.
 Reporter: WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN
 TELLING YOUR COLLEAGUES IN
 PRIVATE WHO HAVE ASKED YOU ABOUT
 THIS?
 HAVE YOU TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO
 THEM WHY IT WAS YOU SAID WHAT
 YOU SAID?
 HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO CONVINCE
 THEM YOU DIDN'T INTEND FOR IT TO
 BE ANTI-SEMITIC?
 IS THERE A REASON YOU'RE NOT
 ANSWERING QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS?
 ARE YOU GOING TO APOLOGIZE?
 THE CRACKS IN THE DEMOCRATIC
 PARTY ARE EVIDENT BOTH IN ITS
 GENERATIONAL DIVIDE AND
 INTENTION BETWEEN THE
 ESTABLISHMENT AND MORE LEFT WING
 MEMBERS, AS YOU SAW THERE.
 IT'S NOT JUST ON THIS POINT.
 YESTERDAY, AT THE WEST-SOUTHWEST
 FESTIVAL, OCASIO-CORTEZ GAVE
 THIS TAKE ON CAPITALISM.
 CAPITALISM, TO ME, IS AN
 IDEOLOGY OF CAPITAL.
 IT PUTS CAPITAL, THE MOST
 IMPORTANT THING IS THE
 CONCENTRATION OF CAPITAL, AND IT
 MEANS THAT WE SEEK AND
 PRIORITIZE PROFIT AND THE
 ACCUMULATION OF MONEY ABOVE ALL
 ELSE AND WE SEEK IT AT ANY HUMAN
 AN ENVIRONMENTAL COST.
 TO ME, THAT IDEOLOGY IS NOT
 SUSTAINABLE AND CANNOT BE
 REDEEMED.
 QUITE SOMETHING.
 NEW POLLING BY THE DES MOINES
 REGISTER CROHN INDICATES AN
 APPETITE OF DEMOCRATIC VOTERS
 FOR SOCIALISM WITH BERNIE
 SANDERS TRAILING ONLY JOE BIDEN
 AS FIRST CHOICE FOR PRESIDENT.
 OF COURSE, THERE IS THE MUELLER
 REPORT.
 WHILE DEMOCRATS HAVE FOUGHT FOR
 IT BE MADE PUBLIC, IT'S REPORTED
 THE 2020 CAMPAIGN TEAMS HAVE
 WRESTLED HOW TO HANDLE THE
 MYRIAD SCENARIOS THEY COULD
 POTENTIALLY FACE IN THE WAKE OF
 ITS RELEASE AND WHAT TO DO IF IT
 DOESN'T IMPLICATE THE PRESIDENT.
 DEMOCRATS ALREADY FELT SOME OF
 THAT BURDEN THIS WEEK WHAT THEY
 SAW AS A LIGHT PRISON SENTENCE
 FOR FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN
 CHAIRMAN, PAUL MANAFORT.
 THE BEAT TRUMP FERVOR AND
 INVESTIGATIONS MAY BE A LOT OF
 GLUE HOLDING DEMOCRATS TOGETHER
 AS 2020 APPROACHES.
 THE LATEST POLLING FROM IOWA
 SHOW VOTERS ARE FAR LESS
 CONCERNED WITH IMPEACHING
 PRESIDENT TRUMP THAN THEY ARE
 DEALING WITH HEALTHCARE OR
 CLIMATE CHANGE.
 THE CRITICAL QUESTION FOR
 DEMOCRATS, CAN THEY DEFTLY
 NAVIGATE THESE FRACTURES OR WILL
 THEIR DIVISIONS PREVENT THEM
 FROM ACHIEVING THE ONE GOAL THEY
 ALL DO AGREE ON, WHICH IS
 GETTING THE PRESIDENT OUT OF THE
 WHITE HOUSE.
 WITH ME THIS HOUR, FORMER
 REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN FROM
 INDIANA CLUB FOR GROWTH, DAVID
 MCINTOSH.
 SENIOR CORRESPONDENT FOR
 WASHINGTON EXAMINER, DAVID
 DRECKER AND ATKINS AND
 CONTRIBUTOR MARIA KUMAR.
 WE WERE HAVING A VERY SPIRITED
 TOPIC ON THIS DISCUSSION ON
 "MEET THE PRESS" I'D LIKE TO
 PICK UP A LITTLE BIT HERE.
 THERE REALLY ARE GENERATIONAL
 DIFFERENCE IS AMONG DEMOCRATS, A
 CERTAIN IRONY A LOT SEEM TO BE
 SUPPORTING BERNIE SANDERS ONE OF
 THE OLDER CANDIDATES IN THE RACE
 BUT IS ON THIS FRONTIER OF
 PROGRESSIVE IDEAS.
 HOW DO DEMOCRATS NAVIGATE THE
 IMPENDING MESS BEFORE THEM AND
 THE DISAGREEMENTS OVER THIS?
 I THINK THEY HAVE TO BE
 CAREFUL THEY RECOGNIZE THE
 MESSAGE THEY WILL STICK TO AND
 NOT FALL INTO THE TRAP OF
 BASICALLY DEFENDING EVERYTHING
 THE REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO
 STICK TO THEM.
 IF YOU HEARD THIS MORNING LIZ
 CHENEY WITH THE PLATFORM FOR THE
 REPUBLICAN PARTY WAS GOING TO BE
 AGAINST THE DEMOCRATS, SHE
 TALKED ABOUT INFANTE SIDE,
 IMMIGRATION, SOCIALISM AND
 LASTLY SAYING DEMOCRATS ARE
 ANTI-SEMITIC.
 DEMOCRATS HAVE TO MAKE SURE
 THEY'RE IN THEIR OWN BOXING RING
 AND NOT CONSTANTLY TRYING TO
 DEFEND THEMSELVES.
 YOU TALK ABOUT THIS
 INTERGENERATIONAL DIVIDE, IT'S
 VERY REAL.
 2020 IS THE FIRST TIME THERE
 WILL BE MORE YOUNG VOTERS BY 12
 MILLION PEOPLE THAN BABY
 BOOMERS.
 THEY'RE VERY UPSET.
 RIGHTLY SO.
 THEY ARE INHERITING AN ECONOMY
 AND ENVIRONMENT THEY FEEL THEY
 CANNOT ACCESS.
 THE BEST WAY TO CRYSTALIZE IT IS
 THE FACT YOU HAD FEDERAL
 EMPLOYEES IN MIDDLE CLASS JOBS
 IN BREAD LINES DURING THE FIRST
 TIME.
 DURING THE GOVERNMENT --
 DURING THE GOVERNMENT
 SHUTDOWN IN OVER A CENTURY.
 THAT IS NOT SMALL.
 I THINK THE ECONOMY IS THE
 ISSUE.
 AND ATTACKING FREE MARKETS,
 YOUNG PEOPLE AND OLDER PEOPLE
 KNOW A FREE ECONOMY IS A LAND OF
 OPPORTUNITY.
 THAT'S A VERY DANGEROUS PLACE
 FOR DEMOCRATS TO LAND UP IN
 THIS.
 YOU WORK FOR CLUB FOR GROWTH
 WAY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF WHAT
 OCASIO-CORTEZ SAYS.
 SHE IS BASICALLY THE STAR OF THE
 DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
 MORE AMERICANS KNOW HER THAN
 NANCY PELOSI OR ANY OTHER MEMBER
 OF CONGRESS.
 IT STRIKES ME THAT, YOU KNOW,
 THERE IS THIS FERVOR AROUND
 ISSUES LIKE MEDICARE FOR ALL,
 RISING INCOME INEQUALITY.
 AT WHAT POINT DOES THE VIEWPOINT
 YOU ALL HAVE COME OUT OF TOUCH?
 I THINK THE KEY FOR
 REPUBLICANS AND CONSERVATIVES IS
 TO SHOW HOW OUR VIEW OF FREE
 MARKETS IS ACTUALLY GOOD FOR
 EVERYBODY.
 GOOD FOR WORKERS, MILLENNIALS,
 WHETHER LOWER INCOME, HIGHER
 INCOME, LAND OF OPPORTUNITY.
 THAT'S THE KEY TO PORTRAY WHAT'S
 GOING ON.
 TAKE MEDICARE FOR ALL.
 THE FLIP SIDE IS EVERY AMERICAN
 IN THE COUNTRY WOULD LOSE THEIR
 HEALTH INSURANCE.
 MOST AMERICANS DON'T WANT TO
 LOSE THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE.
 PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE.
 THEY GIVE IT UP AND SUDDENLY
 THE GOVERNMENT -AND THEY'VE
 SEEN STORIES IN CANADA WHERE
 PEOPLE HAVE TO WAIT FEDERAL
 RESERVE TO GET CRITICAL
 SURGERIES.
 THEY DON'T WANT GO TO THAT.
 THEY WANT TO HAVE THE BEST
 HEALTHCARE IN THE WORLD AND KEEP
 INSURANCE TO PAY FOR IT.
 THEY DON'T HAVE THE BEST
 HEALTHCARE IN THE WORLD, MANY
 DON'T HAVE ANY HEALTHCARE.
 NO, EVERYBODY HAS HEALTHCARE.
 YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE.
 ANYBODY CAN GO TO A HOSPITAL OR
 URGENT CARE WHETHER THEY CAN PAY
 OR NOT AND GET GOOD HEALTHCARE.
 [TALKING OVER EACH OTHER ].
 BEFORE OBAMACARE, THE NUMBER
 ONE REASON FAMILIES DECLARED
 BANKRUPTCY WAS BECAUSE OF
 MEDICAL BILLS.
 AFTER OBAMACARE -NOT THAT IT'S
 PERFECT BUT GETS PEOPLE CLOSER
 TO GROUP.
 WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A GROUP OF
 INDIVIDUALS THAT DON'T HAVE
 ACCESS TO THE ECONOMY.
 THEY DON'T WANT TO BUY A CAR,
 CAN'T AFFORD A HOUSE.
 THEY ARE WELCOMING THIS IDEA OF
 A MORE COLLECTIVE ECONOMY.
 I THINK THIS IS THE ARGUMENT
 WE WILL SEE IN 2020 FOR THE MOST
 PART.
 THE CANDIDATE THAT GETS IT RIGHT
 LEAVES IDEOLOGY BEHIND IN A WAY
 AND TRIES TO TALK TO VOTERS
 WHERE THEY ARE ABOUT THE
 PROBLEMS THAT ARE FACING THEM.
 MOST VOTERS ARE A LOT LESS
 IDEOLOGY THAN WE ARE.
 THEY LOOK AT THE WORLD WITHOUT A
 PHILOSOPHICAL LENS, HAVING
 PROBLEMS AND WHEN SOMEONE SHOWS
 UP SAYING I CAN FIX THINGS AND
 THEY LOOK AT IT AND SAY, I GUESS
 I'M THAT.
 YOU'RE RIGHT.
 DEMOCRATS CANNOT BE DEFENSIVE,
 AT THE SAME TIME, THEY CAN'T BE
 DEFENSIVE.
 IF JOHN HICKENLOOPER, SOMEBODY
 SAY, ARE YOU CAPITALIST?
 ARE YOU A DEMOCRAT?
 PROUD COLORADO AN?
 LABEL, I DON'T LIKE THAT.
 FOR A LOT OF YOUNGER VOTERS THAT
 HAVE LIVED IN A POST COLD WAR
 WORLD THEY DON'T THINK SOCIALISM
 IS VENEZUELA.
 IT'S SWEDEN?
 IT'S LIKE THE UNITED STATES
 JUST LIKE IT IS ONLY I GET MORE
 STUFF.
 THAT ISN'T THE CASE.
 IF THEY THINK THAT YOU HAVE
 TO BE WILLING TO SPEAK TO THAT
 AND NOT DISMISS IT.
 THIS IS 1984 ANYMORE, 2020.
 THEY DON'T THINK SOCIALISM --
 THEY THINK IT'S SOMETHING
 DIFFERENT.
 I WANT TO SEE THE POLL NUMBER
 FOR PEOPLE IN THE DEMOCRATIC
 PARTY WHO LIKE THE FACT WE'RE
 TALKING MEDICARE FOR ALL AND
 GREEN NEW DEAL KNOWING THAT
 PROBABLY WON'T HAPPEN AND
 ACTUALLY KNOW HOW MANY TIMES THE
 WORLD SOCIALISM IS SAID, AMERICA
 WILL NOT TURN TO A SOCIALIST
 COUNTRY AND THAT'S WHERE THE
 ENERGY OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY
 IS.
 SHE'S RIGHT ABOUT THE
 AMBITION.
 YOU LOOK HOW TRUMP AND SANDERS
 WERE SUCCESSFUL IN 2016, THEY
 SAID ALL SORTS OF THINGS THEY
 KNEW WOULDN'T HAPPEN.
 IN FOR STANCE, I WILL BUILD THE
 WALL AND MEXICO WILL PAY FOR IT.
 THE VOTERS APPRECIATED THE
 AMBITION.
 YOU HAVE TO BE AMBITIOUS, I
 CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE I CAN'T
 PAY FOR IT.
 IF ANYTHING, HILLARY CLINTON WAS
 PUNISHED FOR TELLING VOTERS,
 SORRY, I CAN'T DO THAT FOR YOU,
 THAT'S OUT THERE ON A LIMB.
 TO YOUR POINT, I WONDER IF
 THEY'RE LOOKING FOR PEOPLE TO
 TALK ABOUT THINGS ASPIRATIONAL
 BUT THEY CAN'T --
 THAT'S DRIVING THE DEMOCRATIC
 PARTY RIGHT NOW.
 THEY NEED THAT ENERGY.
 THE DEMOCRATIC BASE IS SO
 DIVERSE, CULTURALLY DIVERSE,
 RACIALLY DIVERSE AND
 ECONOMICALLY DIVERSE IN A WAY
 THE REPUBLICANS HAVE NOT.
 THE REPUBLICANS HAVE UNIFIED
 BEHIND DONALD TRUMP AND THEY
 NEED THAT ENERGY LEADING INTO

 SOMETHING WE CAN'T FORGET 100
 YEARS AGO WAS THE NEW DEAL, NOT
 THE BABY BOOMERS BUT THE PARENTS
 WHO SAID WE WILL MAKE A BIG BET
 OR AMERICA AND INVEST BECAUSE
 WE'RE GETTING OUT OF WAR AND
 DEPRESSION BECAUSE WE HAVE
 COMPLETE CHAOS.
 HOW DO WE INVEST IN AMERICA.
 BABY BOOMERS SPENT EVERYTHING
 FOR THEMSELVES AND SPENT THEIR
 FUTURE.
 YOU HAVE 100 YEARS LATER THESE
 MILLENNIALS SAYING, YOU KNOW
 WHAT, WE KIND OF WANT TO GO BACK
 TO WHAT YOUR GREAT-GRANDPARENTS
 WANTED, BECAUSE THAT DOESN'T
 SOUND SO BAD.
 BERNIE SANDERS AND DONALD
 TRUMP ON ONE SIDE AND THE REST
 ON THE OTHERS, PRO WASHINGTON OR
 ANTI-WASHINGTON.
 TRUMP HAS STILL MAINTAINED THAT
 ANTI-WASHINGTON VOICE.
 IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE ON
 THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE WHO EMERGES
 AS THE BEST CONTENDER TO DO
 THAT.
 DAVID HAS A REALLY GOOD POINT
 THERE.
 THAT IS PROBABLY DEFINING OUR
 POLITICS MORE THAN LEFT-RIGHT,
 PRO WASHINGTON, ANTI-WASHINGTON.
 ABSOLUTELY.
 BEFORE THE BREAK, I WANT TO
 SHOW YOU WHAT JEANINE PIERO SAID
 ABOUT OMAR.
 SHE BASICALLY SAID OUT LOUD WHAT
 MANY HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT
 BEHIND THE SCENES WHY IT WAS SHE
 MAY HAVE GOTTEN SO MUCH
 CRITICISM.
 TAKE A LOOK.
 THIS IS NOT WHO YOUR PARTY
 IS.
 YOUR PARTY IS NOT ANTI-ISRAEL,
 SHE IS.
 THINK ABOUT THIS.
 SHE'S NOT GETTING THIS
 ANTI-ISRAEL SENTIMENT DOCTRINE
 FROM THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
 SO IF IT'S NOT ROOTED IN THE
 PARTY, WHERE IS SHE GETTING IT
 FROM?
 THINK ABOUT IT.
 OMAR WEARS A HIJAB, WHICH
 ACCORDING TO THE KORAN, 33:59,
 TELLS WOMEN TO COVER SO THEY
 WON'T GET MOLESTED.
 IS HER ADHERENCE TO THIS ISLAMIC
 DOCTRINE INDICATIVE OF HER
 ADHERENCE TO SHARIA LAW WHICH IN
 ITSELF IS ANTI-THETICAL TO THE
 CONSTITUTION?
 I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THE
 UNITED STATES PROTECTS FREEDOM
 OF RELIGION.
 WHEN YOU WATCH THAT CLIP,
 CLEARLY THE REMARKS SHE HAS MADE
 ABOUT ISRAEL HAVE VERY MUCH
 OFFENDED MANY JEWISH MEMBERS OF
 CONGRESS AND HAVE BEEN CALLED
 REPEATEDLY ANTI-SEMITIC.
 HOW MUCH PRESSURE IS COMING ONTO
 HER BECAUSE SHE IS THE FIRST
 PERSON TO WEAR A HIJAB.
 I THINK SADLY -FIRST OF
 ALL, IT'S NOT JUST FOLKS OF THE
 JEWISH FAITH, FOLKS ALLIES WHO
 SAID WHAT SHE SAID WAS WRONG.
 WAS NOT OKAY.

 WHAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WHO
 IS BASICALLY PEDALLING
 ANTI-SEMITISM AND NOT HAVING A
 CONVERSATION WHERE WE SHOULD NOT
 ALLOW IT AND HAVE ZERO TOLERANCE
 IS COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE.
 SHE WAS IN THE SHADOWS BUT
 TRYING TO HINT AT THE FACT
 BECAUSE SHE WEARS A HIJAB AND
 BECAUSE OF HER MUSLIM FAITH SHE
 CANNOT BE AMERICAN AND THAT IS
 SOMETHING WE SHOULD ALL STAND UP
 AGAINST.
 AND LOOK, CONGRESSWOMAN OMAR
 HAD DEATH THREATS AND THINGS
 POSTED ABOUT HER ON SOCIAL MEDIA
 IS ABHORRENT AND THIS KIND OF
 TALK FEEDS DIRECTLY INTO THAT
 SHE IS A MUSLIM AMERICAN,
 ANTI-SEMITIC, ANTI-AMERICAN,
 THAT SHOULD BE CONDEMNED, TOO.
 IT'S TOUGH.
 I THINK DEMOCRATS ARE FINDING A
 TOUGH TIME PUSHING BACK AGAINST
 THIS IDEA WHERE THE LINE IS
 DRAWN ABOUT HAVING A FRANK
 DISCUSSION ABOUT U.S.-ISRAELI
 POLICY AND WHERE THAT CROSSES
 OVER THE LINE AND REPUBLICANS
 ARE COMING IN THAT SPACE AND
 PUSHING, BULLDOZING OVER THE
 LABELING, DEMOCRATS AS
 ANTI-JEWISH AND ANTI-ISRAELI
 PARTY.
 I SPOKE TO FOLKS CLOSE TO THE
 BENJAMIN NETANYAHU DURING THE
 OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.
 ED A CRITICAL AS THEY WERE AND
 THEY WERE CRITICAL AND PULLED NO
 PUNCH, NOBODY ACCUSED THEM OF
 BEING ANTI-JEWISH OR
 ANTI-ISRAEL, THEY WERE STAUNCHLY
 OPPOSED TO HIM ON POLICY BUT
 THAT NUANCE SEEMS TO BE LOST ON
 THE REPUBLICANS MESSAGING RIGHT
 NOW.
 WE HAVE SO MUCH TO COME.
 CONGRESSWOMAN MAZIE HIRONO JOINS
 ME AND TO PUT MORE JUDGES ON
 FEDERAL BENCHES.

 WELCOME BACK TO KASEY D.C. JOINING US IS CONGRESSWOMAN
 MAZIE HIRONO.
 THANK YOU.
 IN THE HOUSE, THEY HAVE SOME
 MORE TOOLS AT THEIR DISPOSAL.
 WHAT IS YOUR ASSESSMENT SO FAR
 HOW DEMOCRATS ARE HANDLING THE
 CAREFUL BALANCE MAKING SURE
 THEY'RE INVESTIGATING THE
 PRESIDENT WITHOUT GOING TOO FAR
 AND TURNING IT INTO A POLITICAL
 CIRCUS SOME SOURCES HAVE SAID TO
 ME IS A CONCERN OF THEIRS.
 DO YOU THINK THEY'RE STRIKING
 THE RIGHT BALANCE?
 I THINK SO BECAUSE THERE IS
 SO MUCH GOING ON THAT NEEDS TO
 BE INVESTIGATED BY THE TRUMP
 ORGANIZATION.
 THERE ARE COMMITTEES LOOKING
 INTO FIVE ASPECTS OF THE
 FOUNDATION INCLUDING HIS TAX
 RETURNS AND IT DID NOT HAPPEN IN
 THE LAST TWO YEARS WITH CONTROL
 OF THE HOUSE AND CONTRAST TO 85
 PEOPLE AND IN WHITEWATER WHERE A
 THOUSAND REQUESTS CAME OUT AND
 WHAT CAME OUT OF THAT?
 NOTHING.
 THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE
 THERE ARE SO MANY ALLEGATIONS
 ABOUT TRUMP, CAMPAIGN FINANCE
 VIOLATIONS, ALL KINDS OF THINGS.
 THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW
 WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THIS
 PRESIDENT AND HIS ORGANIZATION.
 ONE SOURCE OF MINE DESCRIBED
 WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE HOUSE AS
 AN INSURANCE POLICY FOR
 POTENTIAL IMPEACHMENT
 PROCEEDINGS DOWN THE LINE IF THE
 MUELLER REPORT DOESN'T PRODUCE A
 SMOKING GUN.
 DO YOU VIEW IT THAT WAY?
 I THINK THERE ARE LEGITIMATE
 AREAS OF INVESTIGATION THE HOUSE
 HAS TO PURSUE.
 THE MORE INVESTIGATION, REALLY,
 HE WAS FOCUSED ON THE RUSSIAN
 INTERFERENCE WITH OUR ELECTIONS
 AND ANY COOPERATION,
 COLLABORATION BY THE TRUMP
 ORGANIZATION, THAT IS A
 RELATIVELY LIMITED SCOPE,
 ALTHOUGH OUT OF THE MUELLER
 INVESTIGATION THERE ARE OTHER
 INVESTIGATIONS BEING CONDUCTED
 IN U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICES IN
 WASHINGTON, D.C. AND IN NEW
 YORK.
 THERE ARE SO MANY AREAS OF
 INQUIRY.
 THEREFORE, WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT
 THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION AS BE
 ALL AND END ALL.
 THERE WILL BE OTHER
 INVESTIGATIONS THAT MUST
 CONTINUE.
 I'M INTERESTED TO HEAR YOU
 SAY THAT.
 I HAVE ASKED THIS QUESTION OF
 MANY PEOPLE ABOUT IMPEACHMENT SO
 FAR.
 THE ANSWER IS ALWAYS WE NEED TO
 ALLOW MUELLER TO FINISH HIS
 WORK.
 WOULD YOU SAY IF MUELLER
 FINISHES, THERE IS NO SMOKING
 GUN, WOULD YOU BE READY TO SAY
 THE INFORMATION YOU HAVE SO FAR
 IS ENOUGH TO IMPEACH THIS
 PRESIDENT.
 NO.
 BECAUSE AS I SAID, THE MUELLER
 INVESTIGATION WAS VERY FOCUSED
 ON RUSSIA AND ANY TRUMP
 COLLABORATION, COLLUSION, SETRA
 SETRA
  -ET CETERA VERY LIT TO DO
 WITH CAMPAIGN SPENDING
 VIOLATION, HIS FOUNDATION, MONEY
 RAISED FOR HIS INAUGURATION.
 THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER AREAS OF
 INQUIRY INCLUDING BY THE WAY, I
 WOULD SAY DONALD TRUMP IS
 VIOLATING THE CONSTITUTION ON
 IMMOLLMENTS CLAUSE.
 THERE ARE A LOT OF AREAS.
 IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THE MUELLER
 INVESTIGATION FOR THE LONGEST
 TIME WE WERE VERY CONCERNED
 WOULD BE STOPPED IN SOME WAY.
 I AM HOPING THAT BY NOW IT HAS
 GONE FAR ENOUGH THERE WILL BE
 COMPLETION.
 AT THE SAME TIME, I WANT TO MAKE
 SURE OUR NEW ATTORNEY GENERAL
 RELEASES THE REPORT OF THE
 INVESTIGATION TO MAKE IT AS
 TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE AND HE
 CERTAINLY DIDN'T AGREE THAT WAS
 WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.
 I WANT TO ASK YOU ALSO ABOUT
 THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY, AT THE
 RATE AT WHICH MITCH McCONNELL
 HAS BEEN PUSHING JUDGES THROUGH
 THE SENATE, PRESIDENT TRUMP
 COULD HAVE PUT AS MUCH AS 20% OF
 SERVING FEDERAL JUDGES ON LOWER
 COURTS ON THE BENCH AND TALKING
 POTENTIALLY ABOUT USING THE
 QUOTE UNQUOTE NUCLEAR OPTION TO
 CHANGE THE SENATE RULES TO ALLOW
 THESE JUDGES TO BE CONFIRMED
 MORE QUICKLY.
 HOW MUCH IN YOUR VIEW IS THIS
 DAMAGING THE COUNTRY AND WHAT'S
 YOUR RESPONSE TO McCONNELL'S
 POSSIBLE IDEA HERE?
 MITCH McCONNELL HAS ALREADY
 USED THE NUCLEAR OPTION WITH
 REGARD TO THE SUPREME COURT
 JUSTICES.
 THERE'S MANY ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE
 OF HARM THAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE
 TALKING ABOUT NINE JUSTICES ON
 THE SUPREME COURT VERSUS THE
 HUNDREDS OF JUDGES THAT THERE
 ARE ON CIRCUIT AND DISTRICT
 COURTS.
 THERE'S SOME 850 JUDGES.
 HE ALREADY EXERCISED THE NUCLEAR
 OPTION, WHY HE WAS ABLE TO GET
 TWO PEOPLE, VERY CONSERVATIVE
 IDEOLOGICALLY DRIVEN JUDGES,
 ESPECIALLY CAVANAUGH, ONTO THE
 SUPREME COURT.
 COURTPACING IS GOING ON A PACE
 WITH THESE RIGHT WING
 IDEOLOGICAL JUDGES, SOME 80% OF
 CIRCUIT JUDGES ARE MEMBERS OF
 THE FEDERAL LIST SOCIETY, TRUMP
 NOMINEES.
 ALMOST 10% OF THE JUDICIARY WILL
 BE TRUMP JUDGES.
 WHAT DOES THAT DO TO THE
 INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY.
 I HAVE MAJOR CONCERNS ABOUT
 THAT.
 IT WILL BE, IN MY VIEW,
 DAMAGING.
 IT WILL BE TRUMP'S LEGACY AMONG
 THE MOST DAMAGING STARTING WITH
 THE TWO ON THE UNITED STATES
 SUPREME COURT.
 YOU WILL SEE A LOT MORE 5-4
 SPLIT DECISIONS BECAUSE OF THE
 JUSTICES.
 THAT IS NOT GOOD FOR THE SUPREME
 COURT.
 WANT THE SUPREME COURT TO HAVE
 AS MUCH UNANIMITY AS POSSIBLE TO
 RELATE TO ALL THE CIRCUIT COURTS
 WHAT THE STATE OF THE LAW IS.
 THAT IS NOT WHAT IS PLANNED.
 BEFORE I LET YOU GO, I WANT
 TO TALK ABOUT THE DEMOCRATIC
 PARTY, EMERGING PRIMARY BUT ALSO
 SOME DIVISIONS THAT HAVE
 UNFOLDED OVER THE PAST WEEK OR
 SO.
 ILHAN OMAR WAS TALKING AT A
 FUND-RAISING EVENT AND TALKED
 ABOUT LOYALTY TO A FOREIGN
 COUNTRY, AND THOSE COMMENTS WERE
 CONDEMNED BY MANY DEMOCRATS AS
 ANTI-SEMITIC.
 DO YOU BELIEVE HER COMMENTS WERE
 ANTI-SEMITIC?
 I DON'T THINK SHE INTENDED
 HER COMMENTS TO BE ANTI-SEMITIC.
 WE'RE IN AN ENVIRONMENT NOW
 WHERE JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING WE
 SAY CAN BE VIEWED IN A CERTAIN
 WAY.
 WHAT WE HAVE IS A LOT OF HATE
 SPEECH AGAINST IMMIGRANTS,
 AGAINST MUSLIMS, ALL KINDS OF
 PEOPLE.
 THAT IS WHY I'M GLAD THAT WHEN
 THE HOUSE ACTUALLY TOOK A VOTE
 THAT THEY BASICALLY CONDEMNED
 ALL HATE SPEECH.
 WE CERTAINLY ARE HEARING A LOT
 OF HATE SPEECH FROM THE
 REPUBLICANS AND THE RIGHT.
 FOR THEM TO SUDDENLY REAR UP ON
 THEIR HIND LEGS AND GO AFTER ONE
 PERSON, I THINK WE SHOULD BE
 LOOKING AT OURSELVES AND SAYING
 WE HAVE AN ENVIRONMENT NOW WHERE
 BASICALLY PRESIDENT TRUMP IN HIS
 CAMPAIGN REALLY EXPOSED A LOT OF
 THE DIVISIVENESS AND ISSUES IN
 OUR COUNTRY THAT WE'VE NEVER
 FACED UP TO INCLUDING RACISM,
 INCLUDING ANTI-IMMIGRANT AND
 ANTI-LGBTQ AND THESE ARE ALL
 AREAS WE NEED TO FACE AS A
 COUNTRY.
 FINALLY, ON 2020, MANY OF
 YOUR COLLEAGUES IN THE SENATE
 ARE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.
 HAVE YOU AT THIS POINT DECIDED
 YOU ARE READY TO SUPPORT ONE OF
 THESE DEMOCRATS IN THE PRIMARY
 IN 2020?
 I'M JUST GLAD ON OUR SIDE WE
 HAVE AN ABUNDANCE OF RICHES WITH
 ALL THESE PEOPLE RUNNING.
 WE SHARE VERY COMMON IDEAS.
 WE BELIEVE IN THE SCIENCE, OF
 COURSE.
 IT'S NOT A BELIEF OR RELIGION.
 SCIENCE BEHIND CLIMATE CHANGE
 AND THE FACT WE HAVE TO DO
 SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
 WE BELIEVE HEALTHCARE IS A
 RIGHT, NOT A PRIVILEGE.
 I THINK MOST OF THE CANDIDATES
 ASCRIBE TO THAT.
 ANYBODY STAND OUT TO YOU?
 I THINK PRETTY MUCH ALL OF
 THEM ARE REALLY GOOD ON A LOT OF
 BASIC ISSUES.
 ECONOMIC EQUALITY, SOCIAL
 JUSTICE, ECONOMIC EQUALITY.
 I DON'T HEAR THE OTHER SIDE
 TALKING ABOUT THOSE ISSUES.
 SENATOR MAZIE HIRONO, THANK
 YOU FOR COMING ON THE PROGRAM.
 SEE YOU ON THE HILL COMING UP
 THIS WEEK.
 STILL TO COME, THE PRESIDENT HAS
 EXPECTED TO REVEAL HIS BUDGET
 TOMORROW.
 IT WON'T BALANCE FOR MORE THAN A
 DECADE.
 WE WILL TALK ABOUT HOW DEFIANT
 CONSERVATIVES HAVE STARTED TO
 SING FROM THE SAME HYMNAL AS THE
 PRESIDENT EVEN THOUGH IT DOESN'T
 ALIGN WITH THEIR PHILOSOPHY.
 BACK AFTER THIS.
 ALIGN WITH THEIR PHILOSOPHY. BACK AFTER THIS.
                 ce. But, uh...
          what's up with         your... partner?
 Oh. Well, we just spend all day telling everyone
         how we customize          car insurance,
      because no two people         are alike, so...
           LiMu gets a         little confused
           when he sees           another bird
            that looks        exactly like him.
          [ loud crash ]              Yeah.
       He'll figure it out.
   <i> Only pay for what you need.</i>
       <i> ♪ Liberty, Liberty,</i>        <i> Liberty, Liberty ♪</i>
 PRESIDENT TRUMP IS SET TO RELEASE HIS 2020 BUDGET PROPOSAL
 TOMORROW SETTING THE STAGE FOR
 YET ANOTHER FIGHT WITH
 DEMOCRATS.
 THE PRESIDENT IS SEEKING 8.6
 BILLION DOLLARS TO BUILD MORE
 SECTIONS ON THE SOUTHERN BORDER
 AND MAJOR BUDGET CUTS TO A RANGE
 OF PROGRAMS.
 THE PRESIDENT IS PROPOSING
 ROUGHLY A 5% ACROSS THE BOARD ON
 SPENDING DOMESTIC ACCOUNTS.
 IT WILL BE ANOTHER FIGHT
 ABOUT THE WALL?
 I GUESS THERE IS.
 THE BORDER WALL FOR SECURITY IS
 VERY IMPORTANT, WE HAVE A CRISIS
 DOWN THERE AND THE PRESIDENT HAS
 MADE THAT CASE VERY EFFECTIVELY.
 DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN DOWN THIS
 ROAD BEFORE AND ALREADY GEARING
 UP FOR A FIGHT.
 THE PANEL IS ALREADY BACK WITH
 ME.
 DAVID, I HATE TO BE A DOWNER BUT
 DOES THE BUDGET MATTER.
 IT DOES FROM A POLICY
 PERSPECTIVE.
 THIS IS HOW THE PRESIDENT
 SIGNALS ITS PRIORITIES OF IT.
 THE DEBT AND DEFICITS, VOTERS
 DON'T CARE ABOUT IT.
 THERE IS NO CONSTITUENCY.
 THEY USED TO.
 THERE IS NO CONSTITUENCY FOR
 KEEPING IT IN CONTROL, IT IS THE
 CONSTITUENCY THAT DOESN'T HAVE
 THE POWER TO SPEND ANY MONEY.
 IF YOU'RE A REPUBLICAN VOTER YOU
 PROBABLY SUPPORT ALL THE THINGS
 PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTS TO SPEND
 ON.
 IF YOU'RE A DEMOCRATIC VOTER,
 YOU PROBABLY DON'T LIKE IT.
 WHEN THE TABLES ARE TURNED,
 REPUBLICANS WILL WANT TO HOLD
 DOWN SPENDING AND DEMOCRATS WANT
 TO SPEND LIKE CRAZY.
 THAT IS WHY YOU KEEP GETTING
 WEATHER THAT DON'T ADDRESS ANY
 OF THIS.
 NOTHING WILL CHANGE UNTIL VOTERS
 CHANGE THEIR MINDS.
 WHY DO THESE GUYS ACT LIKE THEY
 DON'T WANT TO GET REELECTED.
 THEY WILL WHEN THEY THINK
 SOMEBODY CARES ABOUT KNIT.
 BUDGETS NEVER MATTER.
 THEY SET OUT THE PRIORITY OF THE
 PRESIDENT.
 THEY NEVER PASS CONGRESS IN ITS
 FORM.
 THIS IS A WALL, A DOCUMENT THAT
 ALLOWS HIM TO PUSH FORWARD
 SAYING HE'S FIGHTING FOR THE
 WALL.
 THE DEMOCRATS WON'T GIVE HIM THE
 MONEY.
 THAT BOLSTERS HIS 2020 NARRATIVE
 WHAT HE'S USING THIS FOR.
 LET'S LISTEN ONE YEAR AGO ON
 THE DEFICIT.
 WE HAVE A TRADE DEFICIT WITH
 ALL COUNTRY IN THE WORLD.
 LISTEN TO THIS NUMBER.
 IF THERE'S ANY CHILDREN IN THE
 ROOM, PLEASE CLOSE YOUR EARS.
 WE HAVE A TRADE DEFICIT OF
 ALMOST $800 BILLION A YEAR.
 WHO MAKES THESE DEALS?
 WITH MEXICO -HE SAYS, OBAMA.
 HONESTLY, IN ALL FAIRNESS TO
 OBAMA, IT'S MORE THAN OBAMA,
 IT'S PLENTY OF PEOPLE, BELIEVE
 ME.
 PLENTY OF PRESIDENTS ALLOWED
 THAT TO HAPPEN AND PEOPLE THAT
 WORK FOR THE PRESIDENT.
 DAVID MCINTOSH, YOU MADE A
 CAREER UNDERSTANDING ECONOMIC
 POLICY.
 DOES THE PRESIDENT UNDERSTAND
 ECONOMIC POLICY?
 LET ME SAY THIS.
 IT'S A YES OR NO QUESTION.
 I THINK HE DOES.
 HE HAS AN INTUITIVE SENSE ABOUT
 IT.
 ECONOMICS IS NOT INTUITIVE,
 QUANTITATIVE.
 THE TRADE DEFICIT IS NOT A BIG
 PROBLEM FOR THE UNITED STATES.
 THE BIGGER PROBLEM DAVID DRUKKER
 POINTED OUT, WASHINGTON HAS
 LULLED THE PUBLIC TO THINK IT'S
 OKAY FOR US TO KEEP BORROWING
 AND MORTGAGING OUR FUTURE.
 THAT'S WHAT THE CLUB FOR GROWTH
 REALLY DOESN'T LIKE ABOUT THIS
 BUDGET.
 A MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.
 A 5% CUT IS VERY GOOD.
 MILLENNIALS, IF ANYBODY, SHOULD
 BE VERY WORRIED ABOUT THIS
 CONTINUED DEBT AND DEFICIT
 SPENDING BECAUSE THEY'RE THE
 ONES THAT ULTIMATELY WILL HAVE
 TO PAY FOR IT.
 WHAT I FIND AMUSING THAT WAS
 A YEAR AGO TO BRING THE TRADE
 DEFICIT DOWN.
 THIS IS THE OPPOSITE PRESIDENT
 BECAUSE UNDER HIS WATCH HE
 EXACERBATED THE TRADE DEFICIT.
 THE FACT HE GAVE MONEY BACK TO
 AMERICANS, WHAT DID THEY DO?
 BY TRADED GOODS.
 BECAUSE THEY'RE CHEAP.
 YES.
 BECAUSE THEY'RE CHEAP.
 AND DOES HE UNDERSTAND ECONOMIC

 PRINCIPLES?
 THAT SOUND BITE INDICATES HE
 DOES NOT.
 LET ME DEFEND THE PRESIDENT A
 LITTLE BIT.
 HE UNDERSTAND THE TAX CUT WOULD
 GROW THE ECONOMY.
 A BENEFIT OF THAT IS THAT
 AMERICANS GET MORE MONEY IN
 THEIR POCKET TO SPEND AND THEY
 SPEND ON GOOD DEALS.
 THAT MEANS IMPORTED GOODS.
 I THINK THE PRESIDENT DOES
 UNDERSTAND ECONOMICS IN
 FOCUSSING ON GROWTH.
 THE TRADE DEFICIT IS NOT THE BIG
 PROBLEM.
 THERE ARE SOME PROBLEMS.
 HE NEEDS A GOOD DEAL WITH CHINA
 TO FORCE THEM TO RESPECT OUR
 PROPERTY RIGHTS.
 THAT'S A GOOD ISSUE TO DEAL
 WITH.
 THE AMOUNT OF THE TRADE DEFICIT
 HAS MORE WITH THE ECONOMIES OF
 THE WORLD NOT DOING SO WELL.
 NA THE PRESIDENT ALSO THINKS
 TARIFFS THAT ENRICH THE TREASURY
 ARE COMING FROM FOREIGN
 COUNTRIES, OF COURSE, THEY'RE
 COMING FROM US JUST LIKE A TAX.
 I THINK DAVID'S RIGHT IN THAT
 THE PRESIDENT HAS A GENERAL
 MACRO CONSERVATIVE APPROACH THE
 ECONOMY, IF I PUT MORE MONEY
 BACK INTO THE HANDS OF
 BUSINESSES AND PEOPLE --
 HAVING BEEN A BUSINESSMAN.
 THEY'LL SPEND MONEY.
 THE PRESIDENT, IRONICALLY HERE,
 ALSO BELIEVES, IN A SENSE THE
 WAY YOU REALLY MAKE THIS WORK IS
 BE A CRONY CAPITALIST.
 IN OTHER WORDS, I WILL USE THE
 HEAVY HAND OF THE GOVERNMENT AND
 MY INFLUENCE TO CALL
 CORPORATIONS, STOP THEM FROM
 MOVING OVERSEAS.
 IF THEY THINK THEY CAN PRODUCE A
 BETTER CHEAPER PRODUCT TO KEEP
 THEIR BUSINESS AFLOAT, I WILL
 REGULATE MARKETS IN A MORE
 TIGHTLY REGULATED WAY THROUGH
 TRADE DEALS RATHER THAN GENERAL
 FREE MARKET APPROACH THAT ALLOW
 COUNTRIES TO INTERACT WITH EACH
 OTHER.
 IT'S VERY CONTRARY TO
 TRADITIONAL REPUBLICAN DOCTRINE
 IN MANY WAYS.
 THIS IS YET ANOTHER SPIRITED
 DISCUSSION I HAVE TO PUT ON
 PAUSE.
 COMING UP, ONE HAS A
 POLITICAL RECORD MORE THAN FOUR
 DECADES LONG AND THE OTHER 46
 YEARS OLD.
 HOW JOE BIDEN AND BETO O'ROURKE
 COULD UP-END THE 2020 RACE AND
 WHY THEY HAVEN'T JUMPED IN YET.
 MY ILLUSTRIOUS PRODUCERS
 FOUND A SIMPSON PIECE JUST FOR
 YOU FROM 20 YEARS AGO.
 AS YOU UNDERSTAND WE
 INHERITED A BUDGET CRUNCH FROM
 PRESIDENT TRUMP.
 HOW BAD IS IT?
 WE'RE BROKE.
 THE COUNTRY IS BROKE?
 HOW CAN THAT BE?

  TO BE NOBODY BUT YOURSELF IN A  WORLD WHICH IS DOING IT'S BEST
  TO MAKE YOU EVERYBODY ELSE...

       MEANS TO FIGHT       THE HARDEST BATTLE,
    WHICH ANY HUMAN BEING    CAN FIGHT AND NEVER STOP.
     DOES THIS SOUND DISMAL?
            IT ISN'T.

 WELCOME TO 2020. THAT IS AN AD PAID FOR BY THE
 REPUBLICAN GROUP FOR GROWTH.
 PART OF A TWO MINUTE AD FOR
 IOWA.
 WE HAVE THE REPUBLICAN CLUB HERE
 SO TO SPEAK.
 THAT'S CORRECT.
 IT'S INTERESTING TO ME YOU
 GUYS ARE ALREADY ATTACKING BETO
 O'ROURKE.
 IS IT MARCH OF 2019.
 YOU'RE GOING AFTER HIM IN IOWA.
 WHY ARE YOU SPENDING MONEY NOW
 AGAINST BETO O'ROURKE.
 PART OF IT IS TO SET THE
 TABLE FOR WHEN HE DOES ANNOUNCE.
 WE KNOW BEATO VERY WELL.
 WE RAN AGAINST HIM IN THE SENATE
 RACE LAST YEAR.
 HE'S NOT WHAT HE PRESENTS
 HIMSELF, AS A PROGRESSIVE MAN OF
 THE PEOPLE.
 HIS BIGGEST ACCOMPLISHMENT,
 REALLY DIDN'T SUCCEED AT IT
 BIGGEST THING HE WORKED ON AS A
 CITY COUNCIL TRIED TO BULLDOZE
 AN HISTORIC HISPANIC
 NEIGHBORHOOD AND GIVE THE
 PROPERTY TO HIS FATHER-IN-LAW TO
 REDEVELOP.
 THAT'S NOT A PROGRESSIVE.
 THAT HE EMBODIES WHITE
 PRIVILEGE, DO YOU THINK VOTERS
 WILL BUY THAT?
 IN THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS IN
 EL PASO WHERE HE'S FROM, YOU HAD
 A HUGE RISE IN PARTICIPATION.
 IN 2014, 84,000 VOTERS WENT OUT
 AND VOTED IN THE MIDTERM.
 IN EL PASO, 204,000 VOTED, ONLY
 10,000 DIFFERENT.
 I THINK WHAT BETO DOES VERY
 WELL, HE RESONATES.
 HE RECOGNIZES HIS PRIVILEGE AND
 TALKS ABOUT IT.
 GOES INTO BLACK CHURCHES AND
 SAYS THESE ARE CONVERSATIONS WE
 NEED HAVE AND KNEELS AND DOES IT
 IN A MORE AUTHENTIC WAY.
 THAT'S WHY THE PRESIDENT WENT
 DOWN AND DECIDED WHERE WOULD HE
 HOLD THAT RALLY WHEN IT CAME TO
 HOLDING THE WALL, NOT WHERE THE
 MAJORITY ARE COMING, HE WENT TO
 EL PASO.
 I WANT TO PICK UP ON THIS
 POINT YOU MADE, VERY
 INTERESTING, THIS AUTHENTICITY
 IDEA AND IDEAS WE HEAR FROM MANY
 OF THE YOUNGER PEOPLE IN THE
 PARTY, JOE BIDEN RECKONING WITH
 THINGS HE DID IN THE 1970s
 BECAUSE HE HAS A LONG RECORD TO
 RECKON WITH TALKING ABOUT BUSING
 AND DESEGREGATION.
 KIMBERLY, WHAT'S YOUR
 ASSESSMENT, THE COMMENTARY I
 HEARD FROM MY SOURCES ON THE
 PROGRESSIVE SIDE, COMMENTARY NOT
 WHAT HE SAID BUT HOW HIS TEAM
 HANDLE IT IN THIS MOMENT SAYING
 HE DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE ANY
 REGRETS ABOUT IT?
 EXACTLY.
 THE BIGGEST IMPEDIMENT FOR JOE
 BIDEN IS THE FACT IT IS NO
 LONGER FOUR YEARS AGO.
 THE PARTY AND POLITICS HAVE
 CHANGED DRAMATICALLY SINCE THEN.
 YOU HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE
 RACE THAT DON'T HAVE THAT
 BAGGAGE, DIDN'T VOTE FOR THE
 IRAQ WAR LET ALONE TALK ABOUT
 BUSING AND INVOLVED IN THE ANITA
 HILL CLARENCE THOMAS
 CONFIRMATION HEARINGS.
 ALL THOSE CLIPS WILL BE BROUGHT
 OUT.
 HE WILL HAVE TO SPEND AS MUCH
 TIME EXPLAINING HIMSELF AS
 PUTTING FORTH POLICY POSITIONS
 AND WILL PUT HIM AT A
 DISADVANTAGE OUT OF THE GATE.
 ARE THESE POLICY SUGAR HIGH
 NAME RECOGNITION?
 THEY ARE ALWAYS NAME
 RECOGNITION AND NOT MUCH MORE
 THAN THAT.
 WE WILL SEE IN 6-9 MONTH.
 BIDEN IS IN A TOUGH SPOT.
 WHEN YOU APOLOGIZE, YOU'RE
 LOSING.
 APOLOGIZING IS THE WORST HE CAN
 DO HOPEFULLY DEMOCRATIC VOTERS
 SEE HE WAS LEGISLATING AND
 MAKING POLICY 30, 40 YEARS AGO
 WHEN TIMES WERE DIFFERENT AND
 NOW DO THINGS DIFFERENT.
 ONE THING ABOUT BIDEN AND BETO,
 YOU TALK TO ANY REPUBLICAN WHO
 SCARES YOU, THEY ONLY MENTION
 REALLY TWO NAMES AND MAYBE A
 THIRD, BIDEN AND BETO AND GET TO
 A THIRD, IT'S USUALLY KAMALA
 HARRIS.
 AND PERHAPS BERNIE SANDERS, I
 WILL MENTION ASIDE FROM KAMALA
 HARRIS, ALL WHITE MEN.
 MORE FROM CASEY D.C. IN JUST
 A MOMENT, KAISE, ALL FEATURED IN

 A SENATE HEARING THIS WEEK ON SEXUAL ASSAULT IN THE
 MILITARY TOOK AN UNEXPECTED TURN
 AFTER MARTHA McSALLY REVEALED
 SHE WAS RAPED.
 I AM A SEXUALLY ASSAULT
 SURVIVOR.
 UNLIKE SO MANY BRAVE SURVIVORS,
 I DID NOT REPORT BEING
 ASSAULTED.
 LIKE SO MANY WOMEN AND MEN, I
 DID NOT TRUST THE VICTIM.
 I BLAMED MYSELF AND I WAS
 ASHAMED AND CONFUSED AND I
 THOUGHT I WAS STRONG BUT FELT
 PARALYZED.
 THE PERPETRATORS ABUSED
 THEIR POWER IN PROFOUND WAYS.
 IN ONE CASE I WAS PREYED UPON
 AND THEN RAPED BY A SUPERIOR
 OFFICER.
 I STAYED SILENT FOR MANY YEARS
 BUT LATER IN MY CAREER GRAPPLING
 WITH THE SCANDAL AND RESPONSES,
 I FELT THE NEED TO LET PEOPLE
 KNOW I, TOO, WAS A SURVIVOR.
 McSALLY WHO WAS A FIRST WOMAN
 TO FLY A COMBAT MISSION FOR THE
 AIR FORCE WENT ONTO SAY WHEN SHE
 REPORT THE INCIDENT, SHE WAS
 DISTURBED HOW THE INCIDENT WAS
 HANDLED THAT SHE NEARLY LEFT THE
 MILITARY.
 LAST YEAR 6,000 MEMBERS WERE
 BEING ASSAULTED.
 CURVING THOSE NUMBERS TO
 SOMETHING SENATOR GILLIBRAND HAS
 MADE HER CORNER STONE GOAL.
 SHE PUT FORWARD A MEASURE THAT
 WOULD TAKEN CASES OUTSIDE THE
 CHAIN OF COMMAND.
 GILLIBRAND PLANS TO REINTRODUCE
 THAT LEGISLATION.
 McSALLY SAYS SHE'S AGAINST
 THAT APPROACH.
 I SHARE THE DISGUST OF THE
 FAILURE OF THE MILITARY SYSTEM
 AND MANY COMMANDERS WHO FAILED
 IN THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES.
 BUT, AS FOR THIS VERY REASON
 THAT WE MUST ALLOW, WE MUST
 DEMAND THAT COMMANDERS STAY AT
 THE CENTER OF THE SOLUTION AND
 LIVE UP TO THE MORAL AND LEGAL
 RESPONSIBILITIES THAT COME WITH
 BEING A COMMANDER.
 THE AIR FORCE SAYS THEY ARE
 READY TO INVESTIGATE THE McSALLY
 INCIDENT BUT THEY SAY McSALLY
 HAVE NOT AGREED TO COOPERATE.
 WHEN WE RETURN, WHAT TO WATCH
 FOR IN THE WEEK AHEAD.

 OUR PANEL THOUGHT THAT WAS A
 REAL CONVERSATION WHEN REPLAYED
 THAT IN THE BREAK.
 NO.
 ANYWAY, LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT WE
 ARE WATCHING FOR THE WEEK.
 THE VOTE ON THE RESOLUTION OF
 DISAPPROVAL FOR THE PRESIDENT'S
 EMERGENCY DECLARATION IS COMING
 UP IN THE SENATE.
 WILL HE CHANGE MINDS?
 IF NOT, THIS THING IS HEADED FOR
 PASSING, HE'LL VETO IT.
 AN ISSUE THAT WE DO NOT THINK
 WOULD RESONATE REPARATIONS.
 AND NOT ONLY CAN YOU USE MONEY
 FOR IT, IT CAN COME IN MANY
 FORMS INCLUDING TAX BREAK.
 WE'LL SEE OTHER CANDIDATES GIVE
 THEIR IDEA WHETHER THEY SUPPORT
 IT OR NOT.
 FURTHER ON THE DECLARATION OF
 EMERGENCIES.
 A LOT OF CONSERVATIVE SENATORS
 ARE GOING TO VOTE AGAINST IT.
 THEY LIKE THE FUNDING OF THE
 WALL BUT THEY DON'T LIKE THE
 ABUSE OF PRESIDENTIAL POWER.
