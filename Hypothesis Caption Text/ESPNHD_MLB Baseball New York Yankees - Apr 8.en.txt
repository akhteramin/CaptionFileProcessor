When it comes to type 2 diabetes, are you thinking about your heart? Well, I'm managing my A1C, so I should be all set. Actually, you're still at risk for a fatal heart attack or stroke. That's where JARDIANCE comes in. It reduces the risk of dying from a cardiovascular event for adults who have type 2 diabetes and known heart diseas. That's why the American Diabetes Association recommends the active ingredient in JARDIANCE. And it lowers A1C? With diet and exercise. <i> JARDIANCE can cause</i> <i> serious side effects</i> <i> including dehydration,</i> <i> genital yeast or </i> <i> urinary tract infections,</i> <i> Ketoacidosis is a serious</i> <i> side effect</i> <i> that may be fatal.</i> <i> A rare, but life-threatening,</i> <i> bacterial infection</i> <i> in the skin of the perineum</i> <i> could occur.</i> <i> Stop taking JARDIANCE</i> <i> and call your </i> <i> doctor right away</i> <i> if you have symptoms</i> <i> of this bacterial infection,</i> <i> ketoacidosis,</i> <i> or an allergic reaction.</i> <i> Do not take JARDIANCE</i> <i> if you are on dialysis</i> <i> or have severe </i> <i> kidney problems.</i> <i> Taking JARDIANCE</i> <i> with alurea</i> <i> or insulin may cause</i> <i> low blood sugar.</i> So, what do you think? Now I feel I can do more to go beyond lowering A1C. <i> Ask your doctor about </i> <i> JARDIANCE today.</i> JON:ESPN'S TELECAST OF MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL IS PRESENTED BY LEAGUE BASEBALL IS PRESENTED BY USAA, INSURANCE, BANKING AND USAA, INSURANCE, BANKING AND INVESTMENTS TAILORED FOR THE INVESTMENTS TAILORED FOR THE MILITARY COMMUNITY.
