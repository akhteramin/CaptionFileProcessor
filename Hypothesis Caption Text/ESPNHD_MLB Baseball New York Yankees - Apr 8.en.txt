 BUT START WITH JUSTIN VERLANDER.
 36 YEARS OLD.
 SECOND IN THE CY YOUNG AWARD
 VOTING LAST YEAR.
 A POWER GUY.
 IT'S INCREDIBLE, THE IMPACT HE'S
 HAD SINCE COMING TO HOUSTON.
 YEAH.
 THIS GUY IS AN ABSOLUTE STUD.
 HE'S ON A SHORT LIST FOR ME OF
 NUMBER ONES IN THE GAME RIGHT
 NOW.
 HE'LL GO THROUGH THE LINEUP FOR
 THE THIRD TIME, WHICH WE NEVER
 SEE ANYMORE.
 HE'S GOT A FOUR-PITCH MIX.
 HE STUDIES AS HARD AS ANYBODY.
 AND HE'S A RARE GUY THAT CAN
 STILL READ SWINGS.
 ON THE OTHER SIDE, IN TANAKA,
 YOU'VE GOT A GUY THAT LIKES TO
 GET THE HITTER TO EXPAND.
 HE'S GONNA MAKE YOU HIT HIS
 PITCH.
 HE'S GOT A CUTTER AND A SLIDER.
 HE'S GOT A DEVASTATING SPLIT
 HE'LL THROW OFF THAT FASTBALL.
 IF YOU'RE THE ASTROS, YOU GOTTA
 GET HIM UP IN THE ZONE, SEE THAT
 BALL UP.
 IF YOU'RE CHASING DOWN, IT'S
 GONNA BE OVER.
 THE THEME FOR TANAKA IS THAT
 HE DOES NOT GIVE IN.
 FOR THE YANKEES, THEY HAVEN'T
 GIVEN IN DESPITE ALL OF THESE
 INJURIES IN THE EARLY GOING.
 SEVERINO IS ON THE DISABLED
 LIST.
 SABATHIA, ANDUJAR.
 NO GREGORY.
 STANTON AS WELL.
 BUT THEY'VE HAD OTHER GUYS PICK

 TANAKA AND VERLANDER.
 BOOG AND ROSSI ON THE CALL.
 COMING UP.
      My experience with USAA
        has been excellent.
      They really appreciate      the military family
       and it really shows.
     With all that USAA offers
     why go with anybody else?
       We know       their rates are good,
       we know that they're
         always going to         take care of us.
   It was an instant savings and
      I should have changed      a long time ago.
       It was funny because       when we would call
     ■uld say      “Oh we can't beat USAA”
     We're the Webber family.
        We're the Tenney's

 and we're USAA members for life.

 BACK HERE AT MINUTE MAID PARK,
 AARON BOONE CHECKING IN AS THE
 YANKEES SKIPPER.
 ONE OF THE THINGS HE'S DEALING
 WITH RIGHT NOW, A LOT OF
 INJURIES, AS THE YANKEES HAVE A
 WHOLE SLEW OF GUYS ON THE
 DISABLED LIST.
 ON THE INFIELD, DIDI GREGORIUS
 WILL BE OUT A WHILE, FOLLOWING
 TOMMY JOHN SURGERY.
 TULOWITZKI JUST WENT ON WITH THE
 BAD CALF.
 STANTON OUT WITH THE BICEPS.
 HICKS, HOPEFULLY BY THE END OF
 THE MONTH.
 ELLSBURY OUT AS WELL.
 AND THEY'RE MISSING SEVERINO,
 SABATHIA AND AS WELL, DELLIN
 BETANCES.
 SO AOT FOR THE YANKEES TO DEAL
 WITH.
 AND YET THEY'RE STILL SCORING.
 IN FACT, THEY'RE SECOND IN THE
 LEAGUE IN RUNS PER GAME.
 HERE'S THE LINEUP THAT HE'S PUT
 TOGETHER, WITH GARDNER, JUDGE
 AND VOIT.
 GLEYBER TORRES BEARS WATCHING.
 HE'S BEEN HOT WITH THREE HOMERS
 IN THE LAST THREE GAMES.
 SEVEN HITS OVER THAT STRETCH.
 THAT YANKEE LINEUP THAT'S RAKING
 IN THE EARLY GOING WILL GO UP,
 AS YOU MENTIONED, DAVID ROSS,
 ONE OF THE TRUE ACES IN THE
 GAME, JUSTIN VERLANDER.
 GETTING THE START HERE TONIGHT.
 YEAH.
 COMING OFF A ROUGH START HIS
 LAST TIME OUT.
 THIS IS A GUY THAT HAS BEEN
 REALLY TRYING TO EVEN CONTINUE
 TO EVOLVE.
 MIXING THE CHANGE-UP A LOT MORE.
 STILL GOT THE FASTBALL AT 95, 96
 MILES AN HOUR.
 HE'S GOT THAT BIG BREAKING BALL
 THAT WAS HIS STAPLE EARLY ON AND
 A NASTY SLIDER.
 HE'S GOT REALLY GOOD NUMBERS
 AGAINST THIS YANKEE TEAM.
 JON: JUSTIN VERLANDER WAS
 G FOR A.J. HINCH, WORLD
 CHAMPION A COUPLE OF SEASONS
 AGO.
 AND NOW THE EXPERIENCE THAT HE
 HAD IN ARIZONA.
 HE JOKINGLY WAS TELLING US,
 PRIOR TO THE GAME, THAT THE
 PLAYERS, BY AND LARGE, DO NOT
 x PLAYING WITH THE ROOF OPEN.
 THE FUNNY THING IS THAT -- AND
 TODAY HERE IN HOUSTON, IT'S
 SPECTACULAR.
 I MEAN, YOU WOULD TAKE PLAYING
 TODAY THAN EVERY MAJOR LEAGUE
 CITY.
 HERE'S THE HOOK.
 WHEN YOU PLAY IN NEUTRAL
 CONDITIONS AND YOU'RE USED TO
 ROOM TEMPERATURE ALL THE TIME,
 THEY OPEN THE ROOF AND THE
 PITCHERS COMPLAIN.
 AND THEY OPEN THE ROOF AND THE
 HITTERS COMPLAIN.
 AND THEY'RE GOING, HEY, ONE OF
 YOU GUYS ARE WRONG, OK?
 IT'S HARD TO HIT AND IT'S HARD
 ■mIT
 YOU G THESE CONTROLLED
 ENVIRONMENTS AND GET■ REALLY
 SPOILED AS A PLAYER.
 SOME GUYS LIKE IT OPEN, SOME
 LIKE IT CLOSED.
 YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE ALL 25

 JON: I GOT TO DO AN INTERVIEW

 THE ALL-STAR GAME WAS IN MIAMI.
 AND JUST OFF THE AIR, SAYING TO
 HIM, GEE, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
 HE'S A LOT BIGGER THAN YOU.
 YOU'RE USED TO BEING BIGGER THAN
 EVERYBODY ON THE FIELD.

 YOU.

 BEST IN THIS LEAGUE.
 DAVID: NO DOUBT.
 YOU LOOK AT, EVEN WITH THE
 YANKEES BANGED UP, THE DEPTH OF
 THAT LINEUP THEY STILL HAVE, AND
 ALL THE HOME RUNS THEY'VE

 DAVID: I FINALLY GOT TO TELL
 CLINT FRAZIER MY STORY.
 MY FIRST EVER DRAFT MEETING I
 GOT TO GO INTO WAS IN BOSTON.
 I WALK IN, AND THEY ARE GOING
 OVER SOME PLAYERS THAT ARE
 POTENTIAL FIRST ROUNDERS.
 THERE IS A LIST UP THERE, AND
 THE FIRST PERSON I SEE IS HIM
 HITTING TANKERSLEY TO RIGHT
 CENTER AND LEFT CENTRAL IN HIGH
 SCHOOL.
 HE GOT DRAFTED BY THE CLEVELAND
 INDIANS IN THAT DRAFT.
 IT WAS COOL.
 HE SAID I THOUGHT I WAS GOING
 TO THE RED SOX.
 I JUST HAD A FEELING.
 I HAD A FEELING.
 IT WAS FUNNY.
 WE WERE TALKING ABOUT JUST THAT
 WHOLE PROCESS.
 HIS ROOMMATE WAS TIM HIER'S
 SON, WHO IS THE HITTING COACH
 FOR THE BOSTON RED SOX NOW.
 HE WAS THERE WHEN I WAS THERE.
 WENT IS
 BACK.■P
 JON: HE HAD A COUPLE OF HOMERS
 ON SUNDAY IN THEIR 15-3 WIN.
 HE HAS SOME SOCK.
 DAVID: NO DOUBT.
 I KEPTONDERING, THIS IS LIKE
 A FIRST ROUNDER NOW?
 A LOTMA
 CK THEN                     w1 SIZE
 AND WHATEVER. N: IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THERE
 IS SOME SCOUTING BIAS AGAINST
 RED HEADS.
 DAVID LLOYD
 DAVID: WHERE DID WE HEAR THAT
 FROM?
 JON: IT IS TRUE.
 I AM TELLING YOU, BASEBALL
 AMERICA DID A PIECE ON.
 NE.
 D: WELL, BASEBALL AMERICA
 IS PRETTY SPOT-ON.
 HOW MANY ARE THERE, BOOG?

 DAVID: I AM.
 JON: 3-2 ON THE WAY.
 DAVID: THEY LIKE THAT UP SIDE.
 HE HAS GREAT UP SIDE.
 I THINK HE HAS PUT IT TOGETHER.
 HE HAS CONTINUED TO DEVELOP.
 BUT THAT IS A NICE S?u
 STROKE.
 HE KEEPS THE HAND■p
 BODY.
 A LOT LIKE ALEX BREGMAN,
 KEEPING THEM NICE AND TIED.
 THAT LOWER BODY■■■ WORKS WELL I
 SYNC WE HANDS.
 THAT GUY'S A
 JON: A BASEBALL RAT.
 SWING AND A MISS.
 THAT IS NASTY.
 JUSTIN VERLANDER, LOCK INSIDE
 SO FAR.
 DAVID: THERE AIN'T MUCH YOU CAN
 DO WHEN YOU ARE DROPPING THE
 3-2 BREAKING BALL.
 THIS GUY HAS■■■ IN HIS BACK
 #■■■A■■■■■■UP
 AND UP TO DOWN ALL NIGHT.
 YOU SEE HERE THE FASTBALL UP

 ABSOLUTELY DROPPING OFF THE
 TABLE.
 AND D.J. LEMAHIEU GOING UP FOR
 THE SLIDER, AND DOWN AND AWAY.
 YOU GET FRAZIER, THE FASTBALL
 IS UP.
 AND THEN HE DROPS A 3-2 NASTY
 BREAKING BALL RIGHT THERE.

 HALL OF FAMER.
 JON: OR MAN, ROB FRIEDMAN, THE

 THE SPORT IS, AND THAT IS THE
 NEW YORK YANKEES LAST YEAR HAD
 THE HARDEST AVERAGE FASTBALL

 THEY PLAY THE SHIFT.
 OK, THEY ARE PLAYING TO THE DAT

 THEY ARE SITTING DOWN IN THEIR
 MEETINGS BEFORE GAMES, AND THAT
 IS WHAT THEY ABOUT.
 JON: GOT IT.
 TO -- SO IT IS NOT PASSIVE.
 THEY ARE DICTATING THAT.
 DAVID: I THINK FOR THEIR
 HERS TO EXECUTE CERTAIN
 PITCHES, THATS EXACTLY WHAT
 JON: AND NOT EVERY TEAM IS  ■y■@
 DOING IT.
 AT TAMPA BAY I NEVER GOT
 PITCHED IN.
 THEY ONLY PITCHED ME IN AND
 PLAYED ALL THEIR LEFT FIELDERS
 ON THE OTHER SIDE.
 I WAS LIKE WAIT, THIS IS
 OP■ I AM USED■
 KIND OF THREW ME FOR A LOOP.
 AND I COULDN'T HIT TO BEGIN
 WITH, SO IT REALLY DIDN'T
 MATTER.
 ALEX COBB THROWING ME SINKERS
 IN, AND CHANGE-UPS IN.
 IT WAS FRUSTRATING.
 YOUARD GROUND BALL, THERE ARE T
 THERE.
 JON: GET IT IN THE AIR.
 DAVID: I DIDN'T KNOW THE

 I WAS JUST FOCUSING ON THE
 CONTACT THING.

 YOU ARE ON TOP OF IT.
 ROBINSON CHIRONOS IS TEXTBOOK

 THIS IS THE GREAT THING ABOUT A

 YOU WEAR 2 NOW.
 TELL ME WHY?
 ALEX: 30 WAS LIKE THE 30 TEAMS
 THAT DIDN'T TAKE ME FROM HIGH

 AND NUMBER TWO, NOW, BECAUSE
 JETER AND BECAUSE I'M PLAYING

 GAVE YOU A LITTLE CALL AND SAID
 YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY WITH THAT

 2:00 AND PLAYING BASEBALL UNTIL
 10:00 AT NIGHT AND HIS PARENTS
 KEPT ASKING HIM, ARE YOU BURNED
 OUT, DO YOU WANT TO STOP?
 NOPE, THIS IS WHAT I LOVE.
 DAVID: THAT'S WHAT IT BOILS DOWN
 TO, THE LOVE THAT HE HAS.
 IT COMES THROUGH IN THE
 REPARATION AND WHAT HE DOES.
 IF YOU DON'T LOVE IT LIKE HE
 DOES, YOU DON'T SPEND THE TIME
 IN THE BATTING CAGES AND AROUND
 THE GUYS TALKING BASEBALL.
 HE REMINDS ME A LOT OF DUSTIN

 JON: I'M GOING TO SIT HERE AND
 SAY I THINK THE DODGERS ARE
 GOING TO BE FINE.
 DAVID: SEEMS LIKE THEY SCORE 10
 A NIGHT.
 JON: THERE'S ALSO THE ELEMENT,
 THEY BUILT THEIR ROSTER IN A
 WAY -- THEY'VE USED -- WE SHOWED
 THE STAT WITH THE DODGERS.
 ALL FOUR YEARS UNDERREW
 FRIEDMAN, THEY'VE USED AT LEAST
 LAYERS AND IN THE 125 YEARS
 OF THAT FRANCHISE PRIOR, THEY
 HAD DONE IT TWICE.
 IVELY ARE USING LOTS OF
 PLAYERS.
 DAVID: THE SPEECH DAVE ROBERTS
 GAVE THOSE GUYS IN SPRING
 TRAINING, HEY, LOOK, THIS IS
 AT WE DO, WE USE EVERYBODY SO
 EXPECT TO BE UP HERE.
 WE'RE GOING TO USE YOU.
 I DON'T CARE WHAT LEVEL WE'RE
 AT, IF YOU BELONG HERE, WE WILL
 FIND A SPOT FOR YOU.
 INJURIES HAPPEN AND WE NEED
 EVERYBODY IN THE ORGANIZATION ON
 THAT 40-MAN ROSTER.
 JON: HERE'S TYLER WHITE.
 WITH TWO DOWN.
 THIS GUY'S A GOOD HITTER.
 HE'S IMPROVED DEFENSIVELY.
 33RD ROUND PICK IN 2013 OUT OF
 WESTERN CAROLINA.
 THEY LIKE THE STRIKE ZONE
 SCROLL, GOOD ON BASE SKILLS AND
 THE SLUG.
 CENTER FIELD, GARDNER IS RIGHT
 THERE.
 THEY GO 1-2-3 ON EIGHT PITCHES.
         New lower price.
 Wow. That's a lot of asparagus.
            Yeah, you said get            a bunch of asparagus.

 Alrighty, you guys are    almost all set.

 THE SHELF AND DOUBLE WHAMMY,
 BETANCES, SON OF A PITCH.
 IS THERE A DOCTOR IN THE HOUSE.
 THEY HAVE SOME PRETTY CLEVER
 HEADLINE WRITERS.
 I CAN STILL REMEMBER THE YANKS,
 PLAYING THE WHITE SOX, PICKING
 UP THE BACK PAGE OF THE "POST"
 AND THEY HAD BEEN SWEPT THREE IN
 A ROW AND IT JUST SAID,
 "STINKY."
 DAVID: THEY'VE ALWAYS GOT THEM
 LAID OUT.
 YOU GO TO THE VISITING
 CLUBHOUSE, YOU COME TO TOWN,
 THEY'VE GOT THEM ALL LAID OUT IN
 THE CLUBHOUSE.

 JON: NOT "THE TIMES".

 MAJOR LEAGUE HISTORY.

 IT IS HISTORY AND THERE YOU HAVE
 IT.
 GAVE IT A RIDE BUT THAT'S 0 FOR
 HIS LAST 47 SO SOMEWHERE, BOOG,
 EUGENIO VALEZ IS POPPING THE

 DAVID: THOSE ARE THREE LINE
 DRIVES, TOO.
 TWO OPPO, ONE TO RIGHT.
 THAT STINKS.
 SORRY, CHRIS DAVIS.
 I FEEL BAD FOR YOU, BUDDY.■
 JON: LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.
 IF YOUE 0-47 AND I WLIKE,
  ROSSI, THOSE WERE THREE
 LINE DRIVES TO LEFT FIELD.
 YOU KNOW, THAT SHOULD FEEL GOOD.
 HOW WOULD THAT WORK OUT FOR ME?
 DAVID: IF I WAS CHRIS DAVIS I'D
 BE LIKE, YEAH, SAVE IT, BOOG,
 AND I'M RICH, BY THE WAY.
 I'M REALLY RICH.
 JON: YOUR LONGEST 0-FER WAS

 DAVID: THANKS FOR BRINGING IT
 UP.

 PITCHES TO CATCH, THAT
 SPLIT-FINGER, NOT KNOWING WHERE
 IT'S GOING.
 YOU SAW HIM THROW THAT BACKDOOR

 AND A DANGEROUS MAN AT THE DISH.
 25 YEARS OLD, AN ALL-STAR AND
 THE ALL-STAR GAME M.V.P. LAST
 YEAR IN WASHINGTON, D.C., ALEX
 BREGMAN.
 THE OTHER THING WE TALKED ABOUT
 AS FAR AS BREGMAN, HE'S GOT THAT
 CONFIDENCE AND HE'S A GOOD
 CLUBHOUSE GUY.
 HE'S ONE OF THOSE GUYS, HE'S
 GONE OUT OF HIS WAY TO LEARN
 SPANISH.■,■,
 AND HE'S ONE OF THOSE UNITERS,
 ONE OF THOSE GUYS THAT BRINGS
 EVERYBODY TOGETHER.
 TYPICALLY IN THIS SPORT IT'S
 BEEN THE LATIN GUYS HAVE BEEN
 FORCED TO LEARN ENGLISH AND HIS
 THING WAS, OK, WELL MAYBE I NEED
 TO TAKE A STEP THAT DIRECTION
 AND LEARN SPANISH.
 AND HE PLAYS IN AN INFIELD WHERE
 SPANISH IS THE FIRST LANGUAGE OF
 CORREA, OF ALTUVE AND GURRIEL.
 DAVID: THAT'S GREAT AWAREF
 HIS SURROUNDINGS, ANOTHER REASON
 WHY HE'S A BASEBALL RAT.
 JON: THE ASTROS, WITH MEN IN
 SCORING POSITION, .162, GO
 FIGURE, 29TH OUT OF 30 TEAMS.
 THEY'VE BEEN GETTING ON BASE,
 THEY'VE BEEN SLUGGING.
 I WAS ASKING A.J. HINCH, WHAT'S
 THE DEAL, WHY HAVEN'T YOU GUYS
 SCORED?
 AND HE SAID IT'S THE SITUATIONA.
 ■çç IS, IF THEY'RE THI IN
 THE LE■■■■■■■ IN ON BASE AND FOH
 IN SLUGGING BY JUNE, I THINK THE
 RUNS PER GAME WILL WORK ITSELF
 OUT.
 DAVID: THEY'LL BE JUST FINE.
 JON: 1-1.
 POPPED UP AND IT'S JUDGE COMING
 DOWN.
 HE MAKES THE CATCH.
 DAVID: SOME OF THE KEYS FOR ME,
 WITH GUYS IN SCORING POSITION,
 GOT TO THINK SMALL.
 NICE PITCH BY TANAKA.
 HE'S MASTERED THE SLIDER ON THE
 OUTSIDE PART OF THE PLATE TO THE
 RIGHT-HANDED HITTER.
 HE KEEPS IT RIGHT ON THE EDGE OF
 THE STRIKEYOU REACH
 FOR IT AS HE'S GOT THAT
 CROSS-BODY DELIVERY.
 BREGMAN JUST PULLS OFF IT ENOU
 TO FLY OUT TO RIGHT.
 WITH JUDGE'S ARM, YOU'RE NOT
 TESTING THAT THING FROM THIRD.
 JON: AARON JUDGE, ONE OF THE
 BETTER THROWING ARMS OUT THERE.
 DAVID: I REALLY I THINK THAT
 SITUATIONAL HITTING, HITTING
 WITH RUNNERS IN SCORING
 POSITION, WE LOVE A BIG NUMBER.
 IF WE CAN THINK SMALL, BASE HIT,

         Hi, Mrs. Gorman.
            Hey, Theo.
       <i> police radio: I have</i>   <i> the stolen vehicle in sight.</i>
          [police siren]




      <i> police radio: </i>    <i> it's safe to slow it down.</i>

         <i> OnStar Advisor:</i>  <i> Mr. Grantham, this is OnStar.</i>
         <i> OnStar Advisor:</i>  <i> The police have your vehicle.</i>         JARDIANCE asks...
         When it comes to         type 2 diabetes,
      are you thinking about      your heart?
    Well, I'm managing my A1C,
      so I should be all set.
  Actually, you're still at risk
     for a fatal heart attack     or stroke.
 That's where JARDIANCE comes in.
   It reduces the risk of dying   from a cardiovascular event
 for adults who have type 2 diabetes and known heart diseas.
 That's why the American Diabetes Association recommends
       the active ingredient       in JARDIANCE.
        And it lowers A1C?
      With diet and exercise.
      <i> JARDIANCE can cause</i>      <i> serious side effects</i>
     <i> including dehydration,</i>
    <i> genital yeast or </i>    <i> urinary tract infections,</i>
    <i> Ketoacidosis is a serious</i>    <i> side effect</i>
       <i> that may be fatal.</i>
  <i> A rare, but life-threatening,</i>  <i> bacterial infection</i>
   <i> in the skin of the perineum</i>   <i> could occur.</i>
      <i> Stop taking JARDIANCE</i>
 <i> and call your </i> <i> doctor right away</i>
  <i> if you have symptoms</i>  <i> of this bacterial infection,</i>
          <i> ketoacidosis,</i>
    <i> or an allergic reaction.</i>
      <i> Do not take JARDIANCE</i>
     <i> if you are on dialysis</i>
 <i> or have severe </i> <i> kidney problems.</i>
       <i> Taking JARDIANCE</i>       <i> with alurea</i>
      <i> or insulin may cause</i>      <i> low blood sugar.</i>
      So, what do you think?
    Now I feel I can do more    to go beyond lowering A1C.
     <i> Ask your doctor about </i>     <i> JARDIANCE today.</i>

 THEN LOOKING AT THE DATA AND THD
 TEAMS HAVE IT MORE AND MORE
 WHERE THEY SIT THERE AND THE
 PI■■K AND LOOK AT,
 WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE COMING
 OUT OF THE HAND AND WHAT WAS THE
 DATA TO MATCH IT.
 DAVID: WE JUST SAW TWO GREAT
 PITCHERS IN THE DUGOUT FOR
 HOUSTON TALKING ABOUT THEIR
 FINGERS AND WHERE THE FINGERS
 ARE ON THE BASEBALL.
 THAT'S WHAT THESE CAMERAS ARE
 ABLE TO DO, AND SLOW DOWN, HELP
 THEM ANALYZE WHAT THEY'RE
 FEELING AND WHAT IS ACTUALLY
 HAPPENING SO THEY CAN MAKE THE
 MINOR ADJUSTMENTS AND GIVE THEM
 THE MOST PRODUCTIVE SPIN ON
 THEIR PITCHES.
 JON: THEY MATCH THE VISUAL DATA
 WITH THE FIELD.
 THAT'S THE PERFECT THING.
 BECAUSE IN THE PAST, YOU'D GET
 THE FEEL OF, OK, DAVID, WAS THAT
 A GOOD SLIDER?
 YEAH, I THINK THAT WAS A GOOD
 SLIDER, IT FELT LIKE A GOOD
 SLIDER.
 NOW THEY GO BACK AND LOOK AT HOW
 IT COMES OUT THE OF THE HAND AND
 THEN YOU LOOK AT THE DATA AND
 THE SPIN RATE IS WHAT THEY WANT.
