 ALL RIGHT EVERYBODY, BREAKING
 TONIGHT, MY EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW
 WITH RUSH LIMBAUGH, WHO WAS WITH
 PRESIDENT TRUMP THIS WEEKEND AS
 HE BEGINS TO MOVE PAST THE
 MUELLER REPORT.
 AND LOOK AHEAD.
 AND NOW JOE BIDEN BELIEVES HE
 CAN BEAT THE PRESIDENT IN A RACE
 FOR THE WHITE HOUSE, REPORTEDLY
 JUST DAYS FROM ENTERING INTO THE
 RACE.
 THE START LOOKING A LITTLE
 ROCKY, THE DATE MAY BE A MOVING
 TARGET.
 WE WILL SPEAK TO SOMEONE LATER
 IN THE SHOW WHO IS CLOSE TO HIS
 CAMPAIGN.
 GOOD EVENING EVERYONE, I
 MARTHA MacCALLUM AND THIS IS
 "THE STORY" ."
 THE PRESIDENT TWEETING UP A
 STORE, HERE IS THE LATEST ONE
 FROM JUST MOMENTS AGO.
 HE SAYS "YOU MEAN THE STOCK
 MARKET HIT AN ALL-TIME RECORD
 HIGH?
 AND THEY ARE ACTUALLY TALKING
 IMPEACHMENT?
 WILL I EVER BE GIVEN CREDIT FOR
 ANYTHING BY THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA
 ARE RADICAL LIBERAL DAMS?
 NO COLLUSION," JUST FOR GOOD
 MEASURE AT AN EXCAVATION POINT.
 HERE IS RUSH LIMBAUGH, HOST OF
 "THE RUSH LIMBAUGH SHOW, RUSH,
 THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, GREAT
 TO SEE YOU THIS EVENING.
 Rush: THANK YOU FOR HAVING
 ME.
 THIS IS A ONE HOUR ON FOX I
 HAVEN'T DONE IN A WHILE, SO IT
 IS GREAT TO BE HERE.
 Martha: IT IS GREAT TO HAVE
 YOU BACK.
 I WANT TO START WITH JOE BIDEN,
 YOU'VE SEEN HIM RUN FOR
 PRESIDENT TWICE BEFORE, IN 1984
 AND 1988.
 WHAT VERSION OF JOE BIDEN DO YOU
 THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET THIS
 TIME, AND HOW DO YOU THINK YOU
 WILL DO?
 Rush: MARTHA, LET ME SAY, I
 SIT HERE TONIGHT COME IN MY
 PALATIAL EIB SOUTHERN COMMAND
 STUDIO.
 I REMAINED STUNNED AND AMAZEDDED
 THAT THE DEMOCRAT PARTY AND THE
 MEDIA DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHO
 DONALD TRUMP IS.
 THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW HE
 WON, THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW
 HE IS GOING TO WIN BACK A

 THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE PEOPLE
 O VOTED FOR HIM OR WHY.
 THEY HOLD ALL OF THAT IN
 CONTEMPT.
 HERE'S<■NG: JOE BIDEN IS
 PROBABLY THE BEST CHANCE THEY'VE
 GOT, AND HE DOESN'T HAVE A.Z■Z■?

 Martha: ALL RIGHT, SPEAKING
 OF THE OTHER FOLKS WHO ARE
 RUNNING, LET'S LISTEN TO
 ELIZABETH WARREN TALKING ABOUT
 HER LEAVING 95% OF COLLEGE DEBT.
 WATCH THIS.
 WE ARE GOING TO ROLLBACK
 STUDENT LOAN DEBT FOR ABOUT 95%
 OF STUDENTS WHO HAVE IT.
 AND PART TWO IS TO MAKE SURE
 THAT WE NEVER GET IN THIS MESS
 AGAIN ON STUDENT LOAN DEBT, AND
 THAT IS TO MAKE COLLEGE
 UNIVERSALLY AVAILABLE, WITH FREE
 TUITION AND FEES.
 Martha: SO THERE IS A LOT
 OF FREE STUFF AND A LOT OF THESE
 PLANS, MEDICARE FOR ALL, RUSH,
 FREE COLLEGE TUITION, YOUR DATA
 GOES AWAY.
 THE PRESIDENT AND THE APPROVAL
 NUMBERS ARE DOWN AROUND 35%.
 IS HE VULNERABLE TO ALL OF THESE
 PROMISES FROM ALL OF THESE
 DEMOCRATS?
 Rush: NO, THE POLLS RIGHT
 NOW DON'T MEAN ANYTHING, MARTHA.
 IS ANYONE A MEMBER OF THE POLL
 TWO YEARS BEFORE 2016?
 THEY ALL HAD HILLARY WINNING IN
 A LANDSLIDE.
 THERE IS WAY TOO MUCH THAT IS
 GOING TO HAPPEN.
 POCAHONTAS IS NOT GOING TO BE
 THE NOMINEE.
 THESE DEMOCRATS ARE ALL IN THE
 PROCESS OF TRYING TO OUT-LEF
 OR OUT-LIBERAL EACH OTHER, AND
 THERE IN A CAN$a$a$a$a
 GIVE AWAY THE MOST.
 BUT WITH ELIZABETH WARREN,
 FORGIVING COLLEGE LOANS,
 FORGIVING■@■@■@x@x@■@■@■@ DEBT,D
 PROMISING FREE COLLEGE, MEDICARE
 FOR ALL, A GREEN NEW DEAL -WHY
 IS ANYBODY GOING TO■@D TO GO
 TO COLLEGE, BEC■@■@■@
 GOING TO NEED A JOB, BECAUSE
 DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO BE GIVEN
 NO MIND GIVING EVERYONE A
 UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME CARED WHY
 DOES ANY OF THIS MATTER?
 NONE OF THIS IS REAL, NONE OF
 THIS CAN HAPPEN.
 THIS IS DISINFORMATION, AND IT
 IS REALLY, I THINK IT IS AN
 INDICATION OF JUST HOW LITTLE
 THEY THINK OF THEIR OWN VOTERS.
 THAT THEIR OWN VOTERS DON'T EVEN
 WANT TO WORK.
 THEY DON'T EVEN WANT TO ACHIEVE.
 THEY DON'T EVEN WANT TO PURSUE
 EXCELLENCE.
 THEY JUST WANT TO HAVE THEIR
 HANDS OUT AND VOTE FOR WHOEVER
 IS GOING TO GIVE THEM THE MOST.
 WHAT A WAY TO RUIN A LIFE.
 NO ONE WOULD RAISE KIDS THIS
 WAY.
 WHY IN THE WORLD HE DOES A
 DEMOCRAT PARTY THINK -I CAN
 ANSWER THAT TOO -SOMETIMES THE
 BEST QUESTIONS ARE GET ARE THOSE
 I CAN ANSWER MYSELF THERE THEY
 CAN'T WIN ON POLICY.
 THEY CAN'T WIN ON ANYTHING OF
 SUBSTANCE, SO THEY HAVE TO
 DEMONIZE, THEY HAVE TO
 CRITICIZE, THEY HAVE TO IMPUGN
 AND DESTROY THE CREDIBILITY OF
 ALL OF YOUR OPPONENTS, AND THEN
 PROMISED TO GIVE EVERYTHING
 AWAY, PROMISE TO BE SANTA CLAUS.
 IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK AGAINST
 BEFORE.
 IT MIGHT WORK AGAINST ROMNEY OR
 A TRADITIONAL REPUBLICAN, BUT IT
 WON'T WORK AGAINST DONALD TRUMP.
 Martha: LET ME ASK YOU THIS
 THEN, BECAUSE IT SEEMS THAT WHEN
 YOU GO TO HIGH SCHOOLS AND
 COLLEGE CAMPUSES, AND EVEN IN
 HOLLYWOOD AND OTHER PLACES, THAT
 DEMOCRATS HAVE WON THE ARGUMENT,
 TO A CERTAIN EXTENT.
 THERE IS A FEELING THIS COUNTRY
 AMONG A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT THIS
 IS THE WAY WE SHOULD LIVE.
 IT REALLY BREAKS DOWN THE
 COUNTRY IN TERMS OF THOSE WHO
 THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE GIVING
 ALL OF THESE THINGS, AND THE
 PEOPLE WHO ARE TRUMP SUPPORTERS.
 Rush: MARTHA, IF YOU WOULD
 GO TO THE PLACES IN THIS COUNTRY
 THAT ARE NOT ON THE COAST, NOT
 IN THE ELITE, BIG URBAN AREAS
 THERE AND GO TO THE AREAS
 DONALD TRUMP WON THE ELECTION,
 TRADITIONAL DEMOCRAT, WHITE,
 BLUE-COLLAR NEIGHBORHOOD, YOU'RE
 NOT GOING TO FIND THAT ATTITUDE.
 THESE ARE THE PEOPLE DEMOCRATS
 USED TO RELY ON.
 THEY'RE THE PEOPLE THE DEMOCRATS
 HAVE LOST.
 THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT VOTE
 FOR TRUMP, AND THEY LOVE TRUMP
 EVEN MORE THAN THEY DID IN 2016.
 THE MAJORITY OF THIS COUNTRY IS
 NOT YET AT THE PLACE WHERE IT
 WANTS EVERYTHING GIVEN TO THEM.
 OF COURSE YOUNG PEOPLE WANT
 THINGS GIVEN TO THEM.
 KIDS ALWAYS DO.
 PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT YET MATURE
 COME HAVEN'T LIVED ENOUGH, BUT
 WE ARE DOING A GREAT DISSERVICE
 TO OUR KIDS BY SHORTCHANGING
 THEIR HUMANITY, SHORTCHANGING
 THEIR OPPORTUNITIES TO EXCEL, TO
 BECOME SOMETHING, TO BECOME
 LARGER THAN THEMSELVES.
 THEY ARE NOTHING MORE THAN PONDS
 THAT CAN BE BOUGHT WITH VOTES,
 AND I DON'T THINK THERE IS A
 MAJORITY OF OUR POPULATION -UP
 AGAINST DONALD TRUMP IS THE KEY
 ELEMENT HERE.
 I DON'T THINK THERE'S A MAJORITY
 OF THE POPULATION THAT IS
 SERIOUS ABOUT THINKING THIS IS
 THE WAY THE COUNTRY OUGHT TO BE
 RUN.
 THE STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS,
 WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE WHO TOOK LOANS
 AND PAY THEM BACK?
 WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO, GIVE
 THEM REPARATIONS?
 ARE THEY GOING TO ASK FOR
 REFUNDS?
 WHERE DOES ALL OF THIS STOP?
 IT ISN'T GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE
 FIRST PLACE.
 ALL OF THIS IS DISINGENUOUS, AND
 DISHONEST.
 AND IT DOESN'T GET ANYWHERE NEAR
 THE HEART OF THE PROBLEMS THAT
 WE ARE HAVING IN THIS COUNTRY,
 WHICH I HAPPEN TO THINK REVOLVE
 AROUND THE DISSIPATION OF OUR
 CULTURE, THE DISSOLUTION OF OUR
 SOCIETY, AND SO FORTH, AND THEY
 ARE THE CULPRITS FOR THIS, AND
 THEY NEED TO BE STOPPED.
 THIS KIND OF STUFF IS NOT THE
 ROUTE BACK.
 AND THE FACT THEY ARE TALKING
 ABOUT JOE BIDEN OR KRAZY BERNIE,
 WHO IS LEADING EVERYBODY AT
 THE STAGE, IT IS A TESTAMENT TO
 HOW BANKRUPT THEY ACTUALLY ARE.
 Martha: I WANT TO PLAY
 SOMETHING FOR YOU FROM
 HILLARY CLINTON, THE TIME 100
 CONFERENCE SHE WAS AT, WHERE SHE
 SAYS -I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU LOVE
 THE TIME 100 CONFERENCE AND
 HOW MUCH YOU LOVE
 HILLARY CLINTON, SO HERE SHE IS
 TALKING ABOUT WHY SHE BELIEVES
 PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOULD BE
 INDICTED.
 LISTEN TO THIS.
 THERE IS ENOUGH THERE THAT
 ANY OTHER PERSON WHO HAS ENGAGED
 IN THOSE ACTS WOULD CERTAINLY
 HAVE BEEN INDICTED.
 THE WHOLE MATTER OF OBSTRUCTION
 WAS VERY DIRECTLY SENT TO THE
 CONGRESS.
 IF YOU READ THAT PART OF THE
 REPORT, IT COULD NOT BE CLEARER.
 Martha: WHAT IS GOING
 THROUGH YOUR MIND AS YOU ARE
 LISTENING TO THAT, RUSH?
 Rush: I WAS TRYING NOT TO
 LISTEN TO THAT.
 THIS IS THE IRONY.
 HILLARY CLINTON IS WHO TRIED TO
 RAKE A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION,
 MARTHA.
 HILLARY CLINTON AND HER PALS IN
 THE OBAMA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
 AND THE FBI, THEY ARE THE ONES
 WHO COLLUDED WITH THE RUSSIANS.
 THEY ARE THE ONE THAT GAVE US
 THIS ENTIRELY, TOTALLY BOGUS
 STEELE DOSSIER.
 CAN YOU THINK ABOUT IRONY?

 THIS IS A WOMAN WHO HAS BEEN
 REJECTED BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
 TWICE, REJECTED BY HER PARTY IN

 SHE HAD TO RIG THE PRIMARIES
 AGAINST KRAZY BERNIE IN 2016 TO
 GET THE NOMINATION.
 SHE IS THE LAST PERSON WHO OUGHT
 TO BE LISTENED TO ABOUT WHAT
 OUGHT TO HAPPEN TO DONALD TRUMP.
 SHE HASN'T ACCOMPLISHED ANYTHING
 ANYWHERE NEAR WHAT DONALD TRUMP
 HAS ACCOMPLISHED.
 SHE IS IN NO POSITION TO SIT
 HERE AND SAY WHAT SHE SAW IN THE
 MUELLER REPORT -WELL, SHE CAN
 SAY BECAUSE SHE'S AN AMERICAN,
 BUT SHE DOESN'T HAVE CREDIBILITY
 ON ANY OF THIS AS FAR AS I'M
 CONCERNED, AND I'M NOT ALONE.
 Martha: JARED KUSHNER ALSO
 SPOKE AT THE CONFERENCE TODAY,
 AND I KNOW YOU TALKED ABOUT THIS
 TODAY, HERE HE IS TALKING ABOUT
 THE RUSSIANS ACTUALLY DID ON
 FACEBOOK.
 YEAH, LET'S PLAY■
 INVESTIGATIONS AND ALL OF
 THE SPECULATION THAT HAPPENED
 THE LAST TWO YEARS HAS HAD A
 MUCH HARSHER IMPACT ON THE
 DEMOCRACY THAN A COUPLE OF
 FACEBOOK ADS.
 THEY SPENT ABOUT $160,000, I
 SPEND $160,000 ON FACEBOOK EVERY
 THREE HOURS IN THE CAMPAIGN
 PURITY LOOK AT THE MAGNITUDE OF
 WHAT THEY DID ON WHAT THEY
 ACCOMPLISHED, I THINK THE
 PURSUING INVESTIGATIONS HAVE
 BEEN WAY MORE HARMFUL.
 Martha: VERY INTERESTING TO
 HEAR FROM HIM TODAY ON THAT AND
 A LOT OF OTHER THINGS, RUSH.
 Rush: WELL, HERE'S THE
 THING.
 HE'S RIGHT, MARTHA.
 EVERYBODY, AMERICA, PLEASE,
 THERE WAS NEVER ANY EVIDENCE OF
 COLLUSION BETWEEN TRUMP AND
 RUSSIA.
 THE COLLUSION, AS I SAID, WAS
 HILLARY, THE DNC, AND THE
 RUSSIANS VIA STEELE.
 BUT THE RUSSIANS -WHEN MUELLER
 ANNOUNCED THE INDICTMENT OF THE
 RUSSIAN TROLL FARM, ROSENSTEIN
 WITHOUT AN ANNOUNCEMENT, NOBODY
 PAID ATTENTION TO THIS, BUT THE
 END OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT, NOTHING
 IN THESE INDICTMENTS SUGGEST A
 SINGLE VOTE WAS CHANGED.
 NOTHING SUGGESTS THE OUTCOME OF
 ANY ELECTION WAS CHANGED.
 NO AMERICAN IS NAMED IN THE
 INDICTMENT HAVING TO DO WITH IT.
 THERE WAS NEVER ANY EVIDENCE FOR
 THIS.
 THERE WAS NEVER MUELLER -WHEN
 HE GOT THE FILE FROM COMEY, IT
 WAS EMPTY.
 ALL THEY HAD WAS THE DOSSIER,
 AND WE ALL KNOW THAT IT WAS MADE
 UP.
 IT WAS OPPOSITION RESEARCH.
 THIS WAS NOT EVEN AN
 INVESTIGATION OF TRUMP.
 WHAT IT ONCE WAS AN ATTEMPT TO
 OVERTHROW THE 2016 ELECTIONS,
 AND THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION, I
 BELIEVE, WAS ACTUALLY MANY
 THINGS, INCLUDING A COVER-UP AND
 A DISTRACTION TO KEEP PEOPLE
 FROM UNDERSTANDING WHAT REALLY
 HAPPENED.
 DONALD TRUMP ACCOMPLISHED ONE OF
 THE GREATEST ACHIEVEMENTS OF HIS
 LIFE AGAINST ALL ODDS, WITH NO
 ASSISTANCE.
 HIS OWN PARTY WASN'T EVEN THAT
 MUCH BEHIND HIM.
 HE HAS DONE SOMETHING THAT FEW
 AMERICANS WILL EVER DO, AND THEY
 ARE TRYING TO TAKE IT AWAY FROM
 HIM, AND THEY ARE TRYING TO
 SULLY HIS REPUTATION, SIMPLY
 BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE HIM.
 THIS IS A SORDID SITUATION.
 I THINK OUR COUNTRY WAS AT GREAT
 RISK DURING THIS WHOLE THING.
 AND THERE NEEDS TO BE AN
 INVESTIGATION.
 I HOPE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS
 SERIOUS, BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE
 NEED TO BE INVESTIGATED.
 WE NEED TO BE TOLD WHO THEY ARE,
 WHAT THEY DID, EVEN THOUGH WE
 ALREADY KNOW.
 AND THEY NEED TO BE INDICTED.
 Martha: YOU SAY THE
 ATTORNEY GENERAL IS ON IT.
 Rush: BECAUSE THEY CAME
 CLOSE, MARTHA, TO THROWING AWAY
 THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION.
 UNELECTED PEOPLE CAME CLOSE TO
 ACTUALLY PULLING OFF WHAT IS A
 COUP       ,
 AND IT SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN
 FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THOSE
 THAT WATCH CNN DON'T KNOW IT,
 "THE NEW YORK TIMES" IS TRYING
 TO BACK OFF THE DOSSIER NOW.
 "WELL, MAYBE IT WAS RUSSIA" --
 NO KIDDING.
 THEY'VE KNOWN THAT FOR A YEAR
 AND A HALF.
 EVERYONE IN THE MEDIA HAS NO MAY
 HAVE BEEN LYING TO THE AMERICAN
 PEOPLE ABOUT THIS IN AN EFFORT
 TO GET RID OF TRUMP APPEARED HE
 SURVIVED IT, AND IF THEY THINK
 THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE THEM OUT
 AFTER ALL OF THIS, THEY ARE
 DELUSIONAL.
 Martha: AS YOU SAY,
 "THE NEW YORK TIMES" IS NOW
 LOOKING INTO THE DOSSIER.
 THEY SAY THAT MR. STEELE'S
 RUSSIAN INFORMANTS COULD HAVE
 BEEN PRESSURED TO FEED HIM
 DISINFORMATION, WHICH IS
 SOMETHING WE REPORTED SOME TIME
 AGO.
 Rush: COLLUSION!
 WAS WORKING WITH RUSSIANS?
 STEELE, HILLARY CLINTON'S GUY.
 BOB WOODWARD SAID THE OTHER
 DAY -HE'S TRYING TO LINK THE
 DOSSIER TO PUTIN, NOT HILLARY!
 THE DOSSIER TRACES RIGHT BACK TO
 HILLARY AND HER CAMPAIGN WITH
 THE DNC.
 Martha: THEY PAID FOR IT,
 AND THAT IS    MUCH WE KNOW.
 I WANT TO TALK ABOUT A PIECE
 TODAY, THE FORMER PRESS
 SECRETARY FOR BILL CLINTON.
 HE TALKED ABOUT GOING DOWN THE
 IMPEACHMENT ROAD, WE DON'T NEED
 TO GO DOWN THE IMPEACHMENT ROAD
 BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO BE GOOD
 ENOUGH FATHER AS WE MOVE FORWARD
 THAT THE PRESIDENT WILL BE UNDER
 CONTINUED CONSTANT
 INVESTIGATION.
 ALL OF THESE SUBPOENAS ARE OUT
 THERE.
 BUT HERE'S WHAT HE SAID ABOUT
 YOU, RUSH.
 HE SAID PUBLICANS TODAY ARE THE
 PARTY OF RUSH LIMBAUGH,
 SEAN HANNITY, TUCKER CARLSON, A
 COALITION IN THE FACE OF EVERY
 DEMOGRAPHIC TREND IN AMERICA
 WILL MEAN THE LONG-TERM
 REALIGNMENT OF THE FEDERAL
 GOVERNMENT BEHIND THE DEMOCRATS.
 WHAT SAY YOU, SIR?
 Rush: I'M HONORED THEY
 THINK THIS.
 SOME DAYS I'M JUST AN
 ENTERTAINER.
 SOME DAYS I'M A HAS-BEEN.
 NOW I'M THE FACE OF AND THE
 REASON FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
 I THINK THAT ALL OF THIS JUST
 ADDS UP THE FACT THAT THEY ARE
 FRUSTRATED.
 THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO QUOTE
 UNQUOTE DEFEAT ME IN 30 YEARS.
 THEY CAN'T DEFEAT TRUMP COME
 HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO STOP HIM,
 AND I THINK THEY ARE FRUSTRATED.
 THEY HAVE THROWN EVERY WEAPON
 THEY HAVE IN THEIR ARSENAL AT
 HIM, AND IT HASN'T WORKED FOR
 THINGS THEY'VE USED OVER THE
 YEARS THAT HAVE BEEN READILY
 AVAILABLE TO GET RID OF AND TAKE
 OUT ANY REPUBLICAN THEY WANT,
 THEY HAVE BOUNCED OFF OF TRUMP.
 AND I THINK THEY ARE REALLY
 FRUSTRATED.
 RUSH LIMBAUGH, SEAN HANNITY,
 TUCKER CARLSON, WE ARE NOT IN
 POLITICS.
 WE ARE MEDIA TITANS, BUT WE ARE
 NOT IN POLITICS.
 IT IS THE PARTY OF DONALD TRUMP
 RIGHT NOW, AND THE REPUBLICANS
 THAT DON'T REALIZE THAT HAD
 BETTER GET ON BOARD.
 Martha: THAT'S INTERESTING,
 BECAUSE I KNOW YOU SAID YOU ARE
 FRUSTRATED BY OTHER REPUBLICANS
 IN YOUR PARTY, WHO YOU FEEL
 SHOULD BE REJOICING RIGHT NOW,
 SHOULD BE FUND-RAISING OFF OF
 THIS MUELLER REPORT FINDING.
 YOU DON'T THINK THEY ARE DOING
 THAT.
 Rush: I THOUGHT IT WAS
 STRANGE, FOR TWO YEARS, EVERYONE
 IS WAITING WITH BAITED BREATH
 AND BITING THEIR FINGERNAILS,
 WHAT IS MULLER GOING TO DO?
 AND THEN HERE COMES THE NEWS, NO
 COLLUSION, NO OBSTRUCTION.
 WHERE'S THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
 WITH THE CELEBRATORY EMAILS TO
 THEIR VOTERS?
 EVEN FUND-RAISING, OR JUST
 CELEBRATING THE VICTORY, WHERE
 ARE THEY?
 YOU DON'T HEAR THEM.
 THE REASON IS, MARTHA, BECAUSE
 THIS IS A BATTLE NOT BETWEEN TWO
 PARTIES, THIS IS A BATTLE
 BETWEEN THE WASHINGTON
 ESTABLISHMENT AND THE
 DEEP STATE, I CALL THEM THE
 ADMINISTRATIVE STATE, AT
 OUTSIDERS AND AMERICANS WHO FEEL
 DISENFRANCHISED OR UNATTACHED.
 THE FACT THAT THE REPUBLICAN
 PARTY, THERE ARE STILL MANY
 PEOPLE IN THEIR -LIKE
 MITT ROMNEY, SAYS HE WAS SICK
 AND?
 HE WAS SICKENED?
 BY WHAT HE READ IN THE MUELLER
 REPORT?
 THIS IS THE SAME GUY,
 MITT ROMNEY, WHO THEY SAID
 DIDN'T CARE WHAT AN EMPLOYEE'S
 WIFE DIED OF CANCER.
 THE SAME GUY THEY SAID DIDN'T
 PAY HIS TAXES FOR TEN YEARS.
 THE SAME GUY WHO THEY SAID BEAT
 UP SOMEBODY IN PREP SCHOOL.
 THE SAME GUY WHO SAID HE HAD A
 FILE OF NOTHING BUT WOMEN.
 THEY DESTROYED MITT ROMNEY, AND
 HERE HE IS, ON THEIR SIDE.
 WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?
 IT'S STRANGE, AND I THINK THE
 REPUBLICAN PARTY, I KNOW THE
 FIRST NINE MONTHS OF TRUMP'S
 TERM, THEY THOUGHT THE RUSSIAN
 STOCK WAS REAL, AFRAID TO GET
 BEHIND IT.
 THAT IS GONE, AND THERE IS NO
 REASON TO GET
 NO REASON NOT TO GET BEHIND HIM, UNLESS YOU DON'T LIKE HIS
 VOTERS, AND I THINK THAT IS KEY.
 Martha: I SAW PICTURES OF
 THE WEEKEND, YOU PLAYED GOLF
 WITH THE PRESIDENT ON
 EASTER SUNDAY.
 EVERYBODY WOULD LIKE TO HEAR A
 LITTLE BIT, WHAT HIS MOOD WAS
 REALLY LIKE AND WHAT HE WANTS TO
 FOCUS ON NOW■■■■■■■■ñ■ñsñsñs--

 Martha: NO, THAT IS MY
 QUESTION, I WANTED TO KNOW IF

 Rush: OH!
 I WAS ON HIS TEAM.
 HE PICKS WHOEVER IS PLAYING THE
 BASS AND PUTS HIMSELF ON THEIR
 TEAM.
 HE MAY CHANGE TEAMS TO ARCO OR
 THREE TIMES IN A ROUND.
 IT IS JUST FUN, MARTHA.
 Martha: I CAN TELL.
 Rush: PLAYING TEAMS AGAINST
 EACH OTHER, IT IS A FAUX
 COMPETITION, BUT IT IS JUST FUN.
 IF SOMEBODY HITS A BAD SHOT, HE
 TELLS THEM, DROP ANOTHER BALL,
 WHERE YOU'RE HAVING FUN.
 Martha: EVERYONE IS HAVING
 FUN.
 LET ME ASK YOU ONE LAST
 QUESTION.
 I'M CURIOUS, WHEN YOU ARE WITH
 HIM, IF YOU FELT THAT ANY OF THE
 STOP IS WEIGHING ON HIM.
 I KNOW ELIJAH CUMMINGS WANTING
 TO DIG INTO EIGHT YEARS OF
 FINANCIAL RECORDS IS SOMETHING
 THAT SOME IN THE TRUMP CAMP ARE
 NOT HAPPY ABOUT, AND THEY'RE
 PUSHING BACK ON HARD BEER DID
 THAT COME UP AT ALL?
 Rush: P -TO ME, AND
 AROUND ME, HE IS ONE OF THE
 MOST CONFIDENT PEOPLE, HE TALKS
 ABOUT THIS STUFF, BUT HE DOES
 NOT, AT ANY MOMENT, EXPRESS ANY
 CONCERN.
 CERTAINLY NO FEAR.
 HE IS REASSURING.
 HE KNOWS WHO HE IS, HE KNOWS HOW
 PEOPLE SEE HIM, HE KNOWS HE IS
 THE PRESIDENT, HE KNOWS PEOPLE
 ARE RELUCTANT TO SPEAK, THEY
 WILL BE RESPECTFUL.
 AND SO HE ANTICIPATES THINGS
 THEY ARE THINKING OR WONDERING
 ABOUT, AND HE WILL PROVIDE
 ANSWERS TO THINGS.
 BUT MOSTLY, HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY
 TIME SIT DOWN AND TELL ME WHAT
 HE THOUGHT OF MUELLER OR WHAT HE
 THOUGHT OF THIS OR THAT, HE
 DOESN'T -HE CAN'T TELL WHO IS
 GOING TO SPEAK AND WHO ISN'T,
 BUT THAT WOULDN'T GO ALONG WITH
 THE RECIPE FOR THESE THINGS,
 WHICH IS FUN.
 BUT HE DOESN'T HIDE FROM ANY OF
 THIS.
 I WOULD LUNCH AFTER THE ROUND,
 HE WAS TELLING LEXI ABOUT THE
 GOLDEN SHOWERS STORY AND HOW
 RIDICULOUS IT IS, AND EVERYONE
 WAS LAUGHING -THE FACT THAT
 THE MEDIA BELIEVED IT.
 THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY
 THOUGHT THAT TRUMP WOULD HIRE
 SOME PROSTITUTES TO URINATE ON A
 BED OBAMA HAD SLEPT -WE'RE
 LAUGHING OURSELVES SILLY.
 Martha: GREAT TO TALK TO
 YOU, THANKS FOR SPENDING SO MUCH
 TIME WITH US.
 GREAT TO SEE YOU, SIR.
 Rush: THANK YOU, MARTHA
 APPEARED MARTHA.
 Martha: YOU BACK.
 ANDY McCARTHY IS COMING UP
 NEXT.

 I'M REALLY OF THE MIND THAT
 THE MUELLER REPORT IS PART OF
 THE BEGINNING.
 IT'S NOT THE END.
 MAYBE, AS CHURCHILL'S FAMOUSLY
 SAID, THE END OF THE BEGINNING,
 BECAUSE THERE IS STILL SO MUCH
 MORE THAT WE SHOULD KNOW AND ACT
 UPON.
 OBVIOUSLY, THAT IS WHAT THE
 CONGRESS IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
 WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW.
 Martha: HILLARY CLINTON
 ECHOING THE CALLS FOR OTHER
 DEMOCRATS TO WANT TO KEEP THE
 INVESTIGATIONS GOING INTO
 PRESIDENT TRUMP, CHOOSING TO
 PROBE EACH AND EVERY FACET OF
 THE PRESIDENT INSTEAD OF GOING
 ALL IN ON IMPEACHMENT.
 JOINING ME NOW IS ANDY
 McCARTHY, FORMER FEDERAL
 PROSECUTOR AND FOX NEWS
 CONTRIBUTOR.
 GOOD TO SEE YOU TONIGHT.
 HE WROTE A VERY INTERESTING
 PIECE TODAY ABOUT THE
 TRUMP TOWER MEETING, BUT FIRST I
 WANT TO GET YOUR REACTION TO
 WHAT HILLARY CLINTON SAID THERE.
 I THINK SHE IS AN INTERESTING
 PERSON TO HAVE THAT MESSAGE
 COMING FROM, SINCE THE JUSTICE
 DEPARTMENT OBVIOUSLY TANKED A
 CASE AGAINST HER, BUT■@■@■@@@■@@
 KIND OF ATTENTION IS TO@@@@@@@@÷
 CALL FOR IMPEACHMENT, IT■÷■÷■÷■R
 Martha: YEA YOU■@■@NO■÷■÷■÷
 WHOLE STORY, AS YOU SAY, THINK
 ABOUT THE DESTRUCTION OF SERVERS
 WITH HAMMERS AND ALL OF THAT
 STUFF, AND YOU HAVE TO WONDER
 WHAT KIND OF UNCOMFORTABLE
 SUBJECT FOR HER TO TALK ABOUT,
 HAVING SUCH AN INVESTIGATION FOR
 HERSELF, SHE KNOWS WHAT THAT
 FEELS LIKE.
 IN "THE WASHINGTON POST" TODAY,
 SAYING "WHY IMPEACH?
 IN OTHER WORDS, WHEN AN
 INVESTIGATION COULD SWING THE
 2020 ELECTION, WHY TRY TO
 PERSUADE A DOZEN REPUBLICAN
 SENATORS TO BOOT TRUMP FROM
 OFFICE WHEN YOU COULD TAKE THE
 EASIER PATH OF COMMITTING      C
 AND VOTERS TO?"
 I DON'T SEE WHY THOSE THINGS
 ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE.
 I'VE NEVER THOUGHT THAT THE
 IMPEACHMENT EFFORT WAS ABOUT
 IMPEACHING TRUMP, IMPEACHMENT IS
 A POLITICAL PROCESS AND PART OF
 AN ARRAY OF POLITICAL TOOLS
 HERE, I THINK, AND IT HAS ALWAYS
 BEEN ABOUT -OBVIOUSLY IF
 SOMETHING FALLS OUT OF THE
 INVESTIGATION THOUGH LOOKS LIKE
 IT IS FIRE ALARM IMPEACHABLE,
 THEY MAY GO FOR IT, BUT I THINK
 WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO DO IS
 GRADUALLY DRIVE HIS NUMBERS DOWN
 SO HE IS UNELECTABLE BY THE
 STRETCH RUN OF THE CAMPAIGN NEXT
 YEAR, AND THEREFORE YOU DON'T
 REALLY HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE.
 SOME OF THEM CAN PRETEND TO TAKE
 THE HIGH ROAD, WHILE JERRY
 NADLER AND ADAM SCHIFF AND THE
 REST OF THOSE GUYS ON THE
 COMMITTEE DO THE SCUT WORK.
 Martha: THERE IS ALSO A
 PIECE TODAY BY ANDREW COHEN,
 DONALD TRUMP IS NO
 RICHARD NIXON, HE'S WORSE.
 IT'S A CONTINUATION OF THAT
 NARRATIVE.
 DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT
 STATEMENT, FIRST OF ALL?
 I DO THINK WE OUGHT TO PROVE
 SOMETHING AGAINST HIM FIRST.
 I MEAN, NIXON, IF YOU THINK
 ABOUT IT, MARTHA, THE HISTORY OF
 THE UNITED STATES, NIXON IS THE
 ONLY PRESIDENT WHO REALLY WOULD
 HAVE BEEN IMPEACHED IF HE HAD
 HUNG ON AND TRIED TO STAY IN
 POWER.
 WE HAVE NEVER OTHERWISE HAD AN
 IMPEACHMENT.
 WE HAVE NOW HAD A TWO-YEAR
 INVESTIGATION WHERE A FEDERAL
 PROSECUTOR FOUND NO CRIMES
 AGAINST TRUMP.
 I KNOW WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THIS
 ARGUMENT ABOUT OBSTRUCTION, BUT
 WE ARE ONLY HAVING IT BECAUSE
 CONGRESS HAS A DIFFERENT
 STANDARD WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING AT
 IMPEACHABLE OFFENSES THAN
 FEDERAL PROSECUTORS DO.
 I THINK THEY OUGHT TO PROVE A
 CRIME ON HIM FIRST.
 Martha: YOU COULD JUST
 WRITE "THE STORY" APPARENTLY.
 ANDY McCARTHY, GREAT SEEING
 YOU TODAY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH
 FOR YOUR GOOD TO SEE YOU
 TONIGHT, CIRCUIT THANKS,
 MARTHA APPEARED TO BE ON REAL
 SOON.
 YOU BET.
 HE IS DEFINITELY RUNNING, THAT
 IS THE LINE FROM ED RENDELL, WHO
 IS PREPARING A BIG FUND-RAISER
 FOR HIS FRIEND, JOE BIDEN.
 WHILE THERE'S A LOT OF CONFUSION
 AHEAD OF HIS BIG ANNOUNCEMENT,
 HE SAYS THAT HIS DEFTLY
 HAPPENING.
 WE WILL HAVE SOME OF THAT NEXT.
                                t       safe drivers have to
   pay as much for insurance...
             As not safe drivers!
                AH!
     That was a stunt driver.
      That's why Esurance has       this DriveSense® app.
       The safer you drive,
        the more you save.
       Don't worry, I'm not          using my phone
         and talking to a      camera while driving...
                       I'm being                           towed.
                      By the way,
              I'm actually             a safe driver.
           I'm just pretending to            be a not safe driver.
               Cool.
                Bye Dennis Quaid!

 Martha: AFTER MONTHS OF
 ANTICIPATION, CONTROVERSY, AND A
 LITTLE BIT OF CONFUSION, FORMER
 VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN, WE■■■■
 UNDERSTAND TODAY, WILL ENT THE
 2020 RACE.
 HE IS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE VIA
 VIDEO MESSAGE ON FOR THURSDAY,
 THE FIRST OFFçy■;■;■; AT A
 çmL IN PITTSBURGH A FEW
 DAYS LATER.
 JOINING ME NOW, ARI FLEISCHER,
 FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS
 SECRETARY AND FOX NEWS
 CONTRIBUTOR BEARD AND ED
 RENDELL, FORMER DNC CHAIRMAN AND
 PENNSYLVANIA GOVERNOR, WHO IS
 HELPING TO ORGANIZE THE
 FUND-RAISER FOR THE
 FORMER VICE PRESIDENT ON
 THURSDAY.
 GOOD EVENING TO BOTH OF YOU,
 GREAT TO HAVE YOU BOTH HERE.
 LET ME START WITH YOU, A LOT OF
 EVERYTHING YOU PICK UP AND READ
 ON THIS SAYS WE THINK IT IS
 GOING TO BE THURSDAY, FIRST IT
 WAS GOING FOR A WEDNESDAY IN
 CHARLOTTESVILLE, THEN IT WAS
 GOING TO BE THURSDAY, AND THEN
 THERE WAS A LITTLE TENUOUS MESS
 ABOUT THAT, AS WELL.
 WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?
 I CAN'T TELL YOU, I AM NOT
 REALLY AN INSIDER IN THE
 CAMPAIGN.
 I WAS ASKED TO HELP WITH THE
 FUND-RAISER, WHICH IS THAT DAVID
 COHEN'S HOUSE, AND I SAID I
 WOULD.
 GREAT RESPONSES ON THE
 FUND-RAISER, I THINK AMONG
 DEMOCRATS, THERE IS A REAL
 DESIRE TO HAVE JOE BIDEN NOT
 ONLY BE AANDIDATE, BUT BE THE
 NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE
 UNITED STATES.
 Martha: IS THERE ANY PART
 OF YOU, ED, THAT FEELS LIKE IT
 MIGHT NOT HAPPEN ON THURSDAY?
 I KNOW YOU SAY YOU ARE NOT AN
 INSIDER, SPOKE TO THE
 VICE PRESIDENT TEN DAYS AGO
 ABOUT HELPING OUT WITH THIS.
 HOW SOLID DO YOU FEEL ABOUT
 THURSDAY, AS IN ANNOUNCING DAY?
 AS IN ANNOUNCING DAY?
 WELL, I SUSPECT SOMETHING WILL
 HAPPEN ON THURSDAY BECAUSE WE
 WOULDN'T BE HAVING THE
 FUND-RAISER EVENT UNTIL HE WAS
 FORMALLY ANNOUNCED, SO THE
 FUND-RAISING EVENT IS IN THE
 EVENING, THE EARLY EVENING.
 I'M SURE THERE WILL BE SOMETHING
 ON THURSDAY.
 Martha: WHAT DID YOU THINK
 ABOUT THE FACT THERE WAS
 SCUSSION ABOUT A
 CHARLOTTESVILLE ANNOUNCEMENT
 ON WEDNESDAY, WHAT DO YOU
 MAKE OF THIS ROLLOUT SO FAR?
 NOTx7■7 CRISP.
 MARTHA, IF THERE IS ONE DAY A
 CANDIDATE CAN CONTROL, THAT IS
 THE ANNOUNCEMENT DAY.
 THAT IS 100% A PLAN TODAY, UNDER
 THE CAMPAIGNS CONTROL, THE
 STAFF'S CONTROL, IT JUST DOESN',
 THURSDAY, NO CHARLOTTESVILLE, DO
 SOMETHING ELSE, AND THE FOCUS ON
 THE FUND-RAISER IS THE OTHER
 THING THAT IS JUST A LITTLE BIT
 ODD.
 YOU WANT YOUR FOLKS TO BE MORE
 GRASSROOTS, NOT MONEY.
 Martha: ED, WHAT YOU SAY TO
 THAT?
 AND WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE
 UNION, ROLLOUT, SOME PEOPLE LOOK
 AT THAT AND IT FEELS A LITTLE
 BIT MORE LIKE SOMETHING YOU
 MIGHT HAVE DONE A DECADE AGO,
 BUT NOT NECESSARILY THE WAY
 THINGS WORKED, THE WAY THINGS
 HAPPEN TODAY.
 FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T THINK
 ANYONE WHO VOTES STARTING
 FEBRUARY OF NEXT YEAR WILL
 REMEMBER WHAT THE ROLLOUT WAS.
 Martha: PROBABLY TRUE.
 SECONDLY, FOR DEMOCRATS, WE
 HAVE TO WIN BACK, THE DEMOCRATS
 WHO VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP IN
 2016, THOSE WORKING-CLASS
 DEMOCRATS, MOSTLY THE MIDDLE
 PART OF THE STATE, FROM AROUND
 PITTSBURGH, ET CETERA, A UNION
 HALL WITH UNION WORKERS IS A
 GOOD MESSAGE TO SEND.
 IT'S A MESSAGE TO SAY "HEY,
 DONALD TRUMP DIDN'T DO WHAT HE
 SAID HE WOULD DO FOR YOU, I'M
 THE REAL DEAL."
 Martha: WE'VE GOT TO LEAVE
 IT THERE.
 WE'LL HAVE A LOT OF TIME TO TALK
 ABOUT THESE, AS YOU SAY, IN THE
 ARI AND ED, GREAT TO SEE YOU.
 THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
 STILL AHEAD TONIGHT,
 BREAKING NEWS ON THE 2020
 CANDIDATE THAT HE SAYS CHECKS
 ALL THE BOXES FOR THE
 DEMOCRATIC PARTY, AND IT IS NOT

 Martha: THE WHITE HOUSE
 TODAY CONFIRMING THAT THE
 PRESIDENT WILL TRAVEL TO THE
 UNITOM AND ALSO FRANCE
 IN JUNE TO MARK THE 75TH
 ANNIVERSARY OF THE D-DAY LANDIN
 LANDING.
 "THE STORY" WILL BE THERE, AS
 WELL, AND SO WILL MY NEXT GUEST.
 GEORGE CHAMPA IS A WORLD WAR II
 ARMY VETERAN.
 HE WAS AMONG THE 73,000 AMERICAN
 SOLDIERS LANDED ON THE SHORES OF
 NORMANDY ON JUNE 6TH, 1944.
 I WAS A SKINNY KID WHEN I
 LANDED, A SKINNY,
 D-DAY.R-OLD WHEN I LANDED ON
 IT WAS FRIGHTENING FOR ME,
 AND I HAD A HORRIBLE JOB.
 MYLP GATHER THE
 ñ■ ANDñ■ WEñ■ñ■ñ■ñ■ñ■ INITIATEDY
 CEMETERIES AT NORMANDY AND
 THROUGHOUT FRANCE, BELGIUM, AND
 GERMANY.
 WE INITIATED ABOUT 17 TEMPORARY
 CEMETERIES.
 HANDLED ABOUT 75,000 DEAD
 SOLDIERS, THAT IS AMERICAN AND
 GERMAN.
 THE GERMANS DIDN'T PICK UP THEI■
 I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME TO TALK,
 I UNDERSTAND, SO I WILL JUST
 TELL YOU IT WAS A VERY
 FRIGHTENING EXPERIENCE BECAUSE I
 WAS A NERVOUS LITTLE KID GROWING
 UP, TRYING TO GET INTO THE AIR
 CORPS, MY EYES WEREN'T QUITE
  ENOUGH, S PUT IN AS
 A REPLACEMENT FOR THE COMPANY
 THAT WAS SHORT ONE NIGHT.
 I ENDED UP OVER THERE INñ■ñ■LANE
 LOST 18 OF OUR GUYS ON AN
 EXERCISE JUST BEFORE THE
 INVASION.
 WE HAD SIX SURVIVORS, LOST 18 OF
 THE FIRST PLATOON, AND SO WE
 KNEW THERE WAS A WAR ON WHEN WE
 HEARD THAT, NO DRY RUNS.
 WE HAD A FEW MOMENTS,
 FRIGHTENING MOMENTS ON THE WAY
 OVER TO NORMANDY, ALMOST GOT
 TORPEDOED, AND A NAVY GUNNER
 SHOT THEM DOWN BEFORE WE COULD
 RELEASE THE TORPEDO.
 THE SHIP ROCKED AND ROLLED,ñ■■■■
 UP ON DECK TO FIND OUT WHAT
 HAPPENED.
 ANYWAY, I WAS IN FIVE CAMPAIGNS
 THROUGHOUT FRANCE, BELGIUM, AND
 GERMANY, INCLUDING THE BATTLE OF
 THE BULGE, AND THEN WE ENDED UP
 ABOUT 100 MILES FROM BERLIN,
 WHERE WE HAD A TEMPORARY
 CEMETERIES THERE THAT WAS
 OUR GOVERNMENT DIDN'T WANT ANYg■
 OUR GOVERNMENT DIDN'T WANT A■í■E BODIES HAD TO BE DISINTERR
 PRISONERS DIGGING THE GRAVES,
 RE-IDENTIFY REMAINS, PUTTING IN@
 AND BELGIUM.
 M■@■@■@■@ KIND OF
 WORK YOU DID IS THE KIND OF WORK
 A LOT OF
 YOU SAW SO MUCH IN ALL OF
 CAMPAIGNS.
 YOU SAY THAT ABOUT TEN YEARS
 AGO, WHEN YOU ARE 81, YOU BECAME
 A FILMMAKER AT THAT STAGE OF
 THEIR LIVES.
 IF YOU COULD JUST GIVE ME -30
 SECONDS, HALF A MINUTE OR SO,
 WHY YOU DECIDED TO DO THAT.
 I WILL TRY TO TALK TO YOU IN
 NORMANDY AGAIN SO WE CAN
 CONTINUE.
 GO ON, SIR.■8
 TO THIS, BUT IN 2006, IL=L=L=L=D
 NONPROFIT, ONLY GOING TO■4■4■4■4
 FILM, AND ON■4SITE, YOU CAN
 h7h7O
 TEAC YOUNG PEOPLE ABOUT THEhmhm.
 PEOPLE LIKE ME, THAT DID THE
 WORK WE DID COME OF THE MEDICS
 DON'T GET MUCH CREDIT FOR WHAT
 THEY DID, WE SAW WITH THE HIGH
 PRICE OFEDOM IS.
 EVERY DAY, FOR 11 MONTHS, THE
 COMPANY COLLECTED THE DEAD.
 I SAW BODIES IN ALL SHAPES AND
 FORMS, AND IT REALLY BOTHERED
 ME.
 I NEVER FORGOT IT, SO I TELL
 PEOPLE, WHEN THEY HEAR THOSE
 WORDS "THE HIGH PRICE OF
 FREEDOM," YOU HAVE TO REALLY
 THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS THE
 RIGHT THAT MEANS SEEING AMERICAN
 SOLDIERS, 18, 19, 20, LIKE I
 WAS, 18, THAT ARE DEAD.
 IN ALL SHAPES AND FORMS.
 AND YOU NEVER FORGET THAT.
 YOU SEE SOME REALLY TERRIBLE
 SITUATIONS.
 Martha: IT'S AMAZING, AND I
 ENCOURAGE EVERY WANT TO GO TO
 HER WEBSITE, WHICH IS
 LetFreedomRingForAll.org.
 AND ALSO YOUNG HISTORY TEACHERS,
 SO THEY CAN LEARN ABOUT THE
 SACRIFICE THAT WAS MADE.
 WE WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK,
 AND I HOPE WE ARE GOING TO SEE
 YOU IN NORMANDY, SIR.
 THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR
 SERVICE AND BEING ON TO BE 26  6
 TONIGHT.
 THANK YOU, MARTHA.

 HOPEFULS JOCKEYING TO POS■
  THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, BUT ONE
 NAME IS SEARCHING A BIT RIGHT
 NOW AHEAD OF THE PACK, AND THE
 NEW POLLS SHOW PETE BUTTIGIEG,
 MAYOR OF SOUTH BEND, INDIANA,
 KIND OF MOVING UP INTO A SOLID
 THIRD PLACE RIGHT NOW, THE FIRST
 PRIMARY STATES.
 THESE ARE THE POLES THAT ARE THE
 MOST INTERESTING, I THINK, WE
 LOOK AT NEW HAMPSHIRE OR OHIO --
 IOWA.
 HE IS IN THIRD PLACE AT 15%
 RIGHT NOW, TRAILING ONLY BEHIND
 THE POLITICAL HEAVYWEIGHTS OF
 BERNIE SANDERS, AND JUST BARELY,
 JOE BIDEN, WHO IS SUPPOSEDLY
 GOING TO ANNOUNCE LATER THIS
 WEEK.
 BUTTIGIEG GARNERED ATTENTION ON
 THE NATIONAL STAGE AS WELL,
 ESTABLISHING HIMSELF AS A SMOOTH
 POLITICAL OPERATOR AND WANT TO
 WATCH.
 WATCH THIS.
 I THINK HE HAS MADE IT PRETTY
 CLEAR THAT HE DESERVES
 IMPEACHMENT.
 I'M GOING TO LEAVE IT TO THE
 HOUSE AND SENATE TO FIGURE THAT
 OUT, BECAUSE MY ROLE IN THE
 PROCESS IS TO RELEGATE
 TRUMP-ISMS TO THE DUSTBIN OF
 HISTORY.
 PEOPLE SUSCEPTIBLE TO XENOPHOBIA
 AND RACISM, WHEN THEY FEEL OUT
 OF TOUCH WITH POLITICAL
 ENVIRONMENTS THAT THEY ARE IN,
 OVERALL, AND WE BETTER PAY
 ATTENTION TO THAT.
 I WOULD NOT BE RUNNING FOR
 PRESIDENT TODAY IF I HADN'T COME
 OUT.
 ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT
 SCRIPTURE IS DIFFERENT PEOPLE
 SEE DIFFERENT THINGS IN IT, BUT
 THE VERY LEAST, WE SHOULD BE
 ABLE T■■ABLISH THAT GOD DOES
 NOT HAVE A POLITICAL PARTY.
 Martha: HERE NOW,
 BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR
 POLITICAL ANALYST.

 Martha: 4 FEET AWAY FROM
 HIM THE OTHER NIGHT, I KNOW
 EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE GETTING AT.
 YOU GOT THE FULL BRUNT.
 Martha: OH, YEAH.
 THERE WAS AN INTERESTING MOMENT,
 ONE OTHER BUTTIGIEG MOMENT, WHEN
 HE RESPONDED TO THE BACK AND
 FORTH HE HAS HAD WITH
 MIKE PENCE, AND I DID AN
 INTERVIEW WITH RIC GRENELL, WHO
 KIND OF WENT AFTER HIM, SAYING
 HE WAS LAUNCHING A HATE HOAX
 AGAINST MIKE PENCE, AND HERE IS
 HOW HE DEALT WITH THAT IN THIS
 TOWN HALL APPEARED WATCH THIS.
 THE CURRENT AMBASSADOR TO
 GERMANY, RICHARD GRENELL, IS
 ALSO -HE WEIGHED IN ON THIS,
 SAYING YOU'VE BEEN "PUSHING THIS
 HATE HOAX ALONG THE LINES OF
 JUSSIE SMOLLETT FOR A VERY LONG
 TIME NOW, SEVERAL WEEKS."
 HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT?
 ARE NOT A MASTER FISHERMAN,
 WHAT I KNOW OBEYED WHEN I SEE
 IT, AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE
 IT.
 [APPLAUSE]
 Martha: DO YOU THINK YOU
 WILL HAVE TO ANSWER THAT MORE
 FULLY?
 WELL, IT WILL COME UP AGAIN,
 I'M SURE.
 WHEN PETE BUTTIGIEG WENT AFTER
 MIKE PENCE, THEY WERE BOTH IN
 INDIANA WHEN PENCILING KNOW
 MIKE PENCE WAS GOVERNOR.
 HAD A GOOD RELATIONSHIP, AND
 PENCE PRAISED BUDDHA        BUT.
 WAS TRYING TO GET VICTIM STATUS,
 WHICH DOESN'T HURT AS A DEMOCRAT
 FOR THE QUESTION WAS INEVITABLE,
 AND I DON'T THINK HAD A GOOD
 ANSWER.
 THE SUBSTANCE OF THE QUESTION,
 BUT I THINK THE ANSWER HE GAVE
 WAS PRETTY DARN CLEVER.
 Martha: YEAH.
 CHRIS WALLACE HAS A TOWN HALL
 COMING UP WITH PETE BUTTIGIEG ON
 SUNDAY, MAY 19TH, SO WE WILL BE
 WATCHING THAT, BRIT.
 OKAY, MARTHA, I WILL, TOO.
 Martha: THANK YOU SO MUCH,
 GOOD TO SEE YOU, BRIT HUME AND
 WASHINGTON.

        Hey, who are you?
 Oh, hey Jeff, I'm a car thief...
              What?!
           I'm here to     steal your car because,
       well, that's my job.
              What?
              What??
              WHAT?!
              What??
              WHAT?!
              What?!
             [crash]
              WHAT?!
        Haha, it happens.
        And if you've got     cut-rate car insurance,
      paying for this could
 feel like getting robbed twice.
