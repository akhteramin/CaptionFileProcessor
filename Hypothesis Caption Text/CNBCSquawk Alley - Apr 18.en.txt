 GOOD MORNING. IT IS 8:00 A.M. AT PINTEREST
 HEADQUARTERS IN SAN FRANCISCO,
 8:00 A.M. AT ZOOM HEADQUARTERS
 IN SAN JOSE.
 IT'S 11:00 A.M. ON WALL STREET
 AND "SQUAWK ALLEY" IS LIVE.



 GOOD THURSDAYS MORNING.
 WELCOME TO "SQUAWK ALLEY."
 I'M CARL QUINTANILLA WITH MORGAN
 BRENNAN, DAVID FABER AT THE
 NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE.
 YOU GOT PINTEREST SET TO DEBUT
 SHORTLY.
 JON FORTT LIVE AT THE NASDAQ AS
 WE AWAIT ZOOM'S OPENING TRADE
 THERE, AWFULLY BIG SHOW AHEAD
 THIS HOUR.
 WE'LL TALK TO PINTEREST BEN
 SILVERMAN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT
 STOCK OPENS AND ZOOM'S ERIC YUAN
 WILL BE WITH US LIVE FROM THE
 NASDAQ AFTER THAT DEBUT.
 WE'LL START WITH ZOOM AND JON
 WITH THE LATEST.
 Reporter: AS YOU CAN SEE WE
 GOT ABOUT TWO AND A HALF MILLION
 SHARES, INDICATIVE PRICE IS 60
 BUCKS A SHARE, PRETTY REMARKABLE
 CONSIDERING THEY'RE PRICED AT 36
 AND WE JUST HEARD LESS THAN TEN
 MINUTES AGO HERE THAT MORGAN
 STANLEY IS IN NO RUSH.
 I'M TOLD TRYING TO BE DILIGENT
 PUTTING THIS TOGETHER.
 MORGAN STANLEY ALSO INVOLVED
 WITH LYFT ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO
 AND SO WE WAIT HERE, THE CROWD
 FROM ZOOM IS HERE --
 JON, WE'LL TRY TO WORK ON
 YOUR MIC IN A MOMENT.
 IT'S OBVIOUSLY IT'S LOUD HERE
 AND LOUD THERE.
 IN THE MEANTIME WE'LL TURN TO
 PINTEREST.
 WE ARE GOING TO TURN TO
 PINTEREST.
 AS YOU CAN SEE RIGHT BEHIND US,
 INDICATED 23 TO 25, 23 TO 75 SO
 THAT RANGE DOES SEEM TO BE
 NARROWING, WHAT WE HEARD FROM
 BOB PISANI JUST IN THE LAST
 FINAL MOMENTS OF THE LAST HOUR
 IS THAT THIS IS POISED TO OPEN
 IN THE COMING MINUTES.
 WE'LL GO BACK OVER THERE AND GET
 AN UPDATE FROM BOB, HEY.
 Reporter: I THINK THE
 IMPORTANT THING HERE IS WE ARE
 WAITING FOR IT TO OPEN AND IT
 HAS BEEN AROUND THE 23 PRICE, 23
 TO 23.50 FOR MORE THAN 45
 MINUTES NOW.
 THAT'S A GOOD INDICATION THAT
 MOST OF THE TIME IT'LL SETTLE
 SOME WHERE AROUND THERE.
 IT DOESN'T ALWAYS HAPPEN.
 WITH PAGERDUTY, 29 PRICE, ALL OF
 A SUDDEN A WAVE OF ORDERS CAME
 IN BECAUSE PEOPLE SAID I'LL SELL
 IT AT THAT PRICE, I'LL SELL A
 LOT OF IT AND THE PRICE HAD TO
 DROP.
 THE DEMAND SEEMS TO BE FAIRLY
 STEADY.
 LET'S SEE IF I CAN GET AN
 UPDATE.
 WE HEARD ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR
 15 MINUTES A LITTLE WHILE AGO.
 GLENN KURELL, YOU'VE BEEN DOING
 THIS A LONG TIME, WHAT'S GOING
 TO HAPPEN?
 WE'RE STILL IN A GOOD RANGE.
 NOW WE'RE JUST WAITING ON A
 COUPLE MORE PLAYERS TO GET IN
 THE GAME OF THE WE'RE HAPPY WITH
 THE WAY THINGS GOOD LOOK RIGHT
 NOW.
 THE BOOK IS LINING UP GREAT.
 WE'RE FULLY TRANSPARENT AS TO
 WHERE WE LOOK.
 NOW WE'RE JUST WAITING ON ONE OR
 TWO PLAYERS TO MAKE A COUPLE
 ADJUSTMENTS AND WE'RE GOOD TO
 GO.
 Reporter: WHAT ARE THEY
 TRYING TO DECIDE TO DO
 ARE THEY TRYING TO BID FOR MORE
 OR OFFER MORE?
 THEY DON'T WANT TO MISS THE
 PRINT AT THE SAME TIME.
 IF SOMEONE IS BIDDING 23.25,
 MAYBE THEY WANT TO COME UP TO

 THOSE ARE THE THINGS WE'RE
 LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW.
 Reporter: THE FACT THAT WE'VE
 BEEN AT 23 FOR THE LAST 45
 MINUTES OR SO, IS THIS A PRETTY
 GOOD BET THAT'S WHERE WE'RE
 GOING TO OPEN.
 LIKE I SAID, WE HAVE THE
 VOLUME THERE.
 EVERYTHING'S LINED UP ON OUR
 END.
 OUR TECHNOLOGY IS READY TO GO.
 WE'RE JUST WAITING.
 Reporter: WHAT DO YOU LIKE TO
 SEE IN AN OPEN IN TERMS OF
 VOLUME.
 IS THERE A PERCENTAGE GENERALLY
 THAT YOU LIKE TO SEE, 10% OF THE
 FLOAT OF THE AMOUNT OF SHARES
 THAT ARE BEING SOLD?
 WHAT'S A GOOD NUMBER
 IT'S NOT A RULE OF THUMB, WE
 LIKE TO GET 10%.
 I THINK WE'LL BE CLOSER TO 9 TO
 10 MILLION SHARES WHICH IS
 REALLY HEALTHY.
 WE'LL BE READY TO GO.
 Reporter: GLENN, THANKS VERY
 MUCH.
 I ASKED ABOUT THE PERCENTAGE
 BECAUSE THE VOLUME IS A VERY
 GOOD INDICATION OF OVERALL
 INVESTOR INTEREST.
 IF THEY FLOAT 9 MILLION OR 10
 MILLION THAT'S MORE THAN 10% OF
 THE AMOUNT OF SHARES SOLD.
 IF YOU CLOSE AT THE END OF THE
 DAY WITH CLOSE TO 100%, THAT'S
 GENERALLY AN INDICATION OF A
 VERY SUCCESSFUL IPO THAT THERE'S
 ACTIVE TRADING THAT'S INVOLVED.
 THESE ARE JUST ROUGH RULES OF
 THUMB.
 PEOPLE ARE USING, 23 TO 23.50,
 HOLD ON ONE MINUTE.
 IT'S LOOKING CLOSER TO AROUND 23
 TO 23.50 LEVEL.
 GETTING CLOSE.
 TEN TO 15 MINUTES LOOKS LIKE.
 WE'LL BE HERE.
 BACK TO YOU.
 WE'RE GOING TO WATCH AND
 WATCH THE MUELLER REPORT WHICH
 IS NOW ON THE JUSTICE WEBSITE.
 JON FORTT'S BACK AT THE NASDAQ
 WATCHING ZOOM.
 JON, HELLO ONCE AGAIN.
 Reporter: LET'S TRY THIS
 AGAIN.
 62, IT'S GONE UP TWO BUCKS SINCE
 THE LAST TIME YOU SAW ME,
 2.5 MILLION SHARES PAIRED.
 THIS WOULD BE MORE THAN 70%
 ABOVE THE INITIAL PRICING.
 SO THAT IS SIGNIFICANT.
 ALSO WE HEARD ABOUT TEN MINUTES
 AGO MORGAN STANLEY'S IN NO RUSH
 TO GET THIS OUT, TRYING TO BE
 DILIGENT, OF COURSE.
 YOU'LL RECALL MORGAN STANLEY WAS
 INVOLVED IN LYFT ABOUT THREE
 WEEKS AGO AND THE FOLKS AT ZOOM
 THROUGHOUT HERE JUST EAGERLY
 AWAITING THE OPENING OF THE
 STOCK.
 I WAS TALKING TO THE CEO JUST A
 FEW MINUTES AGO, MAYBE ABOUT AN
 HOUR AGO, TALKING ABOUT THE
 CULTURE OF THE COMPANY, HOW
 IMPORTANT IT IS TO KEEP THOSE
 EMPLOYEES HAPPY AS THEY CONTINUE
 ON THEIR JOURNEY OF GROWTH.
 I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO TALKING
 TO HIM MORE ONCE THIS STOCK
 OPENS.
 LET ME TOSS IT OVER TO BERTHA
 COOMBS ACROSS THE ROOM.
 Reporter: WHAT WE'VE HEARD SO
 FAR IS WE'RE ABOUT 15 MINUTES
 AWAY BUT IF YOU LISTEN TO JAY
 HELLER HERE THE HEAD OF CAPITAL
 MARKETS AT NASDAQ, IT LOOKS LIKE
 WE'RE IN THE RANGE OF 62 TO 63.
 THEY WOULD LIKE TO PAIR OFF 3
 MILLION SHARES OR SO.
 THEY'RE TRYING TO COAX MORE
 SELLERS TO SELL SO THE BUYING
 INTERESTS WILL HAVE SOMETHING TO
 PICK UP.
 THIS COULD TAKE A WHILE.
 HE SAID MAYBE ABOUT 15 MINUTES
 OR SO, BUT WE HEARD THAT ABOUT A
 HALF HOUR AGO, SO THEY ARE NOT
 GOING TO RUSH THIS PROCESS AT
 THE MOMENT, FOLKS HERE VERY
 INTERESTED IN WATCHING THE
 SITUATION AS YOU CAN SEE.
 ZOOM, AGAIN, IS ONE OF THOSE
 COMPANIES THAT IS PROFITABLE.
 IT DOES VIDEO CONFERENCING BUT
 IT ALSO WORKS AS A NUMBER OF
 SILICON VALLEY COMPANIES WHICH
 IS AMONG THE BIDDERS HERE AND
 AMONG THE COMPANIES GETTING AN
 ALLOCATION OF $100 MILLION AT
 THAT $36 PER SHARE PRICE, CARL.
 THANK YOU.
 JOINING US ON THE PHONE THIS
 MORNING, COFOUNDER AND EARLY
 FACEBOOK INVESTOR, OF COURSE,
 AUTHOR OF "ZUCKED" WAKING UP TO
 THE FACEBOOK CATASTROPHE.
 THANKS FOR THE TIME.
 ISN'T IT FUN TO HAVE A BLAND
 MARKET.
 I GOT TO ASK YOU, WHICH OF
 THESE TWO BOILING POTS IS MORE
 INTERESTING TO YOU
 I WOULD IMAGINE IT'S PINTEREST
 GIVEN YOUR INTEREST IN SOCIAL
 BUT MAYBE NOT.
 TO BE CLEAR, ZOOM IS THAT
 MOST NEARBY FEAT WHICH IS A
 PROFITABLE IPO COMING OUT OF THE
 TECH SECTOR AND YOU CAN SEE THAT
 THE APPETITE FOR THE URN
 CERTAINTY OF PROFITS IS MAKING
 PEOPLE PAY ANY PRICE NECESSARY
 TO OWN A PIECE OF IT SO FROM A
 STOCK MARKET POINT OF VIEW
 THAT'S THE ONE I FIND
 COMPELLING.
 THAT SAID, I THINK PINTEREST'S
 STRATEGY FOR GOING PUBLIC IS
 BRILLIANT.
 WE TALKED ABOUT THIS THE LAST
 TIME I WAS ON, THE NOTION OF
 PRICING WELL UNDER THE LAST
 PRIVATE ROUND BROUGHT A LOT OF
 PEOPLE INTO THE MARKET.
 SO THEY'LL HAVE A VERY
 SUCCESSFUL IPO AND IT WOULD
 SURPRISE NO ONE IF THE THING
 FINISHED THE DAY WELL ABOVE ITS
 LAST PRIVATE ROUND HAVING LURED
 PEOPLE IN WITH THE POSSIBILITY
 OF A REAL BARGAIN.
 ROGER, I REALIZE THAT
 PINTEREST HAS BEEN DISTANCING
 ITSELF FROM THIS LABEL OF SOCIAL
 MEDIA COMPANY, ARE FIRST TO
 CONSIDER IT SELF A VISUAL
 PLATFORM.
 IT SHOULD BE LUMPED IN WITH THAT
 CATEGORY JUST FROM THE VALUATION
 PERSPECTIVE, BUT HOW DO YOU SEE
 IT
 YOU KNOW THE LABEL ISN'T -- I
 THINK -- THE LABEL OF SOCIAL
 MEDIA USED TO BE A HUGE POSITIVE
 NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN IT'S A
 PROBLEM THAT PEOPLE ARE RUNNING
 FROM IT.
 WHAT'S GOING TO MATTER ON
 PINTEREST IS HOW THE COMMUNITY
 THAT USES IT USED THE PRODUCT
 AND HOW -- AND HOW BAD ACTORS
 USE THE PRODUCT.
 THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO MAINTAIN A
 PLACE WHERE IN GENERAL THE
 BEHAVIOR IS REALLY POSITIVE AND
 SO IN MY MIND WE NEED A NEW
 GENERATION OF SOCIAL PRODUCT
 THAT ARE NOT OVERRUN BY TROLLS,
 NOT OVERRUN BY BAD ACTORS AND IF
 PINTEREST CAN PLAY A ROLE IN
 THAT THEN THEY CAN GIVE SOCIAL
 MEDIA A GOOD NAME AGAIN.
 JON FORTT HERE AT THE NASDAQ
 AWAITING THIS ZOOM IPO OPEN.
 WE TALKED A BIT ABOUT VAL
 EDUCATION IN THE PAST,
 PROFITABILITY, RIGHT NOW ZOOM IF
 IT OPENS AS IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S
 GOING TO BE ABOVE 62 BUCKS A
 SHARE, JUST REALLY A SKY HIGH
 VALUATION, BUT IT'S PROFITABLE,
 HOW DO YOU BALANCE THOSE TWO
 THINGS YOU THINK
 JON, I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS IS
 GOING TO TURN OUT WITH THE FED
 GOING TO A MUCH MORE
 CONCILIATORY TONE.
 JUST BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE'RE
 LATE IN THE MARKET CYCLE,
 VALUATIONS ARE ALREADY
 INCREDIBLY HIGH, THERE'S A LOT
 OF CASH STILL IN THE MARKET AND
 NOW YOU HAVE THIS IPOs THAT WE
 JUST SEE REALLY LOONEY BEHAVIOR
 GOING ON IN THE BEST OF THOSE
 DEALS AS PART OF A SPECULATIVE
 BLOWOFF.
 THAT WOULD HONESTLY BE A
 FANTASTIC THING WHILE IT LASTS,
 BUT, YOU KNOW, I HAVE NO IDEA IF
 THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON OR NOT
 BUT LOOKED AT ZOOM, IT CERTAINLY
 LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GETTING, SHALL
 WE SAY, UNRESTRAINED ENTHUSIASM.
 ROGER, IT'S DAVID FABER.
 THOSE THAT MUST HAVE LIVED
 THROUGH THE DOTCOM BOOM, YOU
 HAVE A TODAY LIKE TODAY TO THESE
 IPOs, IT BRINGS IT TO MIND AS
 SOMEBODY WHO ALSO LIVED THROUGH
 THAT, GIVE ME SOME OF YOUR TAKE
 IN TERMS OF THE SIMILARITIES AND
 THE DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN THE
 CURRENT PERIOD AND THAT ONE.
 WE BOTH KNOW -- WHERE THEY
 WERE SPENDING $2 TO GENERATE A
 $1 OF REVENUE AND OBVIOUSLY HAVE
 SITUATIONS LIKE THAT.
 IF THE MARKET IS WILLING TO PAY
 $100 MILLION VALUATION OR
 $10 BILLION, GIVEN THE UNPROVEN
 NATURE OF THAT BUSINESS MODEL,
 THEN I THINK WE CAN COMFORTABLY
 SAY -- THE BEHAVIOR OF THE DAY
 IS CERTAINLY REMINISCENT OF '99
 EXCEPT THERE WERE VERY FEW
 THINGS IN '99 THAT HAD PROFIT.
 YOU COULD MAKE THE CASE THAT --
 PEOPLE CHASING PERFORMANCE --
 ROGER, WE'VE BEEN TALKING A
 LOT ABOUT THIS IDEA THAT IT'S
 FAVORABLE MARKET CONDITIONS FOR
 COMPANIES TO GO PUBLIC THAT YOU
 HAVE LESS VOLATILITY THAN WE SAW
 AT THE END OF LAST YEAR, STOCKS
 AND MAJOR AVERAGES NEAR OR AT
 HIGHS FOR THE YEAR OR ALL-TIME
 HIGHS, I WONDER IF WE SHOULD BE
 TALKING MORE ABOUT THE DOVISH
 FED AND THE LID THAT'S PUT ON
 INTEREST RATES ESPECIALLY WHEN
 YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOME OF
 THESE HIGH GROWTH TECH UNICORNS
 THAT ARE NOW COMING TO MARKET?
 I'M WITH YOU COMPLETELY.
 I THINK THE FED IS -- I THINK
 THE FED SET UP THE CONDITION
 FOR, YOU KNOW, A SPECULATIVE
 BUBBLE HERE AND INVESTORS SHOULD
 LOOK -- WHILE IT LASTS IT'S
 GOING TO BE JUST REALLY, REALLY
 FUN, BUT YOU WON'T BE THE LAST
 ONE LOOKING FOR A CHAIR WHEN THE
 MUSIC STOPS.
 ROGER, THANK YOU.
 NO GUARANTEE THAT'S WHAT'S
 GOING TO HAPPEN BUT IT SURE
 FEELS THAT WAY.
 THANK YOU.
 ALWAYS GREAT TO GET YOUR
 THOUGHTS AS WE DO AWAIT
 PINTEREST'S OPENING TRADE HERE
 JUST MOMENTS AWAY.
 THE PRESIDENT OF THE NEW YORK
 STOCK EXCHANGE JOINS US HERE AT
 POST NINE.
 STACEY, QUITE A BUSY DAY.
 IT'S A GREAT DAY.
 IT'S REALLY EXCITE TO GO WELCOME
 PINTEREST TO THE NEW YORK STOCK
 EXCHANGE.
 A LOT OF INTEREST IN THIS DEAL
 AND SO WE'RE WAITING FOR IT TO
 OPEN BUT WE'RE EXCITED
 IT'S A GREAT MORNING.
 GOING BACK TO THE QUESTION I
 JUST ASKED ROGER, HOW WOULD YOU
 ASSESS THE MARKET SITUATION?
 CERTAINLY INVESTORS ARE
 CONTINUING TO EXPRESS INTERESTS
 IN THESE DEALS, A LOT OF THEM
 ARE PRICING ABOVE THE RANGE AND
 OPENING EVEN STRONGER.
 WE AREN'T SEEING INVESTORS PULL
 BACK AT ALL.
 THERE'S A LOT OF EXCITEMENT FOR
 WHAT'S IN THE PIPELINE.
 IN TERMS OF THE SO-CALLED
 TECH UNICORNS THAT ARE COMING TO
 MARKET RIGHT NOW AND REALLY IN
 THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS, THE
 NASDAQ HAD ALWAYS SORT OF
 HISTORICALLY BEEN SEEN AS THE
 MORE TECH HEAVY AREA, BUT THE
 STOCK EXCHANGE HAS BEEN
 GATHERING OR WINNING MANY MORE
 OF THESE HIGH PROFILE IPOs, HOW
 HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT
 AND WHAT'S YOUR OUTLOOK?
 ONE THING THAT'S IMPORTANT TO
 RECOGNIZE IS TODAY'S COMPANY
 LOOK VERY DIFFERENT THAN SOME OF
 THE COMPANIES WE WELCOMED TO THE
 MARKETS YEARS AGO.
 THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE USED
 TO REQUIRE COMPANIES TO BE
 PROFITABLE BEFORE THEY COULD
 LIST AND THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE
 SEEING AS YOU KNOW WITH SOME OF
 THE COMPANIES COMING OUT TO
 MARKET.
 WE MODERNIZED OUR LISTING RULES
 TO REFLECT MORE WHAT WE'RE
 SEEING IN THE PUBLIC COMPANIES
 TODAY.
 IF YOU LOOK BACK OVER THE PAST
 FIVE YEARS, OVER 10% OF TECH
 PROCEEDS HAVE BEEN RAISED ON THE
 NYSE.
 SO WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THAT.
 WHAT'S THE PINCH?
 IN OTHER WORDS, YOU GO UP FOR AN
 UBER AGAINST NASDAQ AND OTHERS,
 WHAT DO YOU THINK IS ACTUALLY
 WORKING IN YOUR FAVOR IN TERMS
 OF YOUR ABILITY TO MARKET TO
 THESE COMPANIES TO SAY COME
 HERE
 FIRST OF ALL, THIS IS THE
 PITCH, WE PRICE DISCOVERY IS OUR
 FORTE.
 WE TAKE OUR TIME AND FIND THE
 RIGHT PRICE.
 WE'RE NOT JUST LOOKING FOR WHERE
 THERE'S AN EQUILL LIB RUM.
 WHEN A STOCK OPENS IT'S TRADE AT
 A STABLE LEVEL.
 THE MARKET MODEL IS NUMBER ONE
 WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT
 DIFFERENTIATES US AND WHAT WE
 CAN OFFER COMPANIES AND THAT'S
 NOT JUST ON IPO DAY.
 WHEN THEIR IPO IS EXECUTED
 FLAWLESSLY, SURE, THE MARKET
 MODEL SHINES THERE BUT FOR THE
 LIFE OF THE COMPANY WE TRADE
 WITH LESS VOLATILITY WHICH SAVES
 THEIR INVESTORS MON AND THEIR
 OWN COMPANY MONEY.
 BEYOND THAT, THE S&P 500 IS
 LISTED ON THE NEW YORK STOCK
 EXCHANGE AND THE BRAND
 VISIBILITY THAT WE CAN GIVE THEM
 TO SHARE ALONG WITH THE SUITE OF
 SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE.
 SO THAT'S THE PITCH.
 SO YOU OPENLY USE EXAMPLES
 LIKE LYFT AS CAUTIONARY TALES?
 WE TRY TO AVOID TALKING ABOUT
 SPECIFIC DEALS.
 WE TALK ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO TO
 DELIVER VALUE TO OUR LISTING
 COMPANIES, HOW WE CAN ASSIST
 THEM THROUGH THEIR PROCESS AND
 WE TALK A LOT ABOUT WHAT WE DO,
 HOW WE DO IT AND WHY WE DO IT.
 HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT
 GOES, THE WAVE OF IPOs
 IT'S HARD TO SAY.
 BACK HALF OF THE YEAR, NEXT
 YEAR
 A LOT OF THE BIGGER COMPANIES
 ARE COMING TO MARKET RIGHT NOW.
 WHERE WE'D LIKE TO FOCUS
 ATTENTION IS MAKING SURE SOME OF
 THE SMALLER COMPANIES ARE ALSO
 LOOKING TO COME TO THE PUBLIC
 MARKET SOONER.
 WE NEED TO RIGHT SIZE SOME OF
 THE REGULATION THAT'S EXIST AND
 WE NEED TO FOCUS ON MAKING SURE
 THAT THEY'RE ENCOURAGED TO COME,
 REMOVING BARRIERS THAT MIGHT
 KEEP THEM PRIVATE FOR LONGER AND
 IF WE WANT TO KEEP THAT PIPELINE
 GOING.
 BARRIERS LIKE -- ARE THEY A
 REASON SOME OF THESE COMPANIES
 HAVE BEEN PRIVATE FOR SO LONG?
 ABSOLUTELY.
 THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT
 THINGS.
 SOME OF THE TOPICS THAT WE TALK
 A LOT ABOUT LIKE DUAL CLASS
 STRUCTURES, LIKE CERTAIN ESG
 INITIATIVES OR GUIDELINES YOU
 MIGHT WANT TO PUT ON PUBLIC
 COMPANIES, THOSE ARE ALL THINGS
 THAT GO INTO THE CALCULUS AS TO
 WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT TO STAY
 PRIVATE OR PUBLIC.
 WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE
 ENCOURAGING THEM TO ACCESS THE
 PUBLIC MARKET BECAUSE INVESTORS
 GET TO SHARE ONCE THEY'RE PUBLIC
 AND THE EVERYDAY INVESTOR
 DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS TO PRIVATE
 MARKETS THE WAY LARGE INVESTORS
 DO.
 TO THAT POINT, ONE OF THE
 CONVERSATIONS WE'VE BEEN HAVING
 AND CERTAINLY THIS RESTOKED
 AFTER THE LYFT IPO A COUPLE
 WEEKS AGO IS THE FACT THAT
 RETAIL INVESTORS DON'T HAVE
 ACCESS TO THE SAME AMOUNT OF
 INFORMATION ABOUT A COMPANY
 THAT'S COMING PUBLIC AS THE
 INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS.
 DO YOU THINK THAT NEEDS TO
 CHANGE
 I THINK THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE
 ASKING THAT QUESTION.
 I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY
 INTERESTING TO SEE WHEN SPOTIFY
 CAME TO THE MARKET, THAT WAS ONE
 OF THE THINGS THEY WANTED TO
 ADDRESS.
 THEY MADE ALL THE INFORMATION
 AVAILABLE TO ALL INVESTORS AT
 THE SAME TIME, PUBLICLY
 AVAILABLE ON THEIR WEBSITE AND
 RETAIL INVESTORS HAVE THE SAME
 ACCESS TO INSTITUTIONAL
 INVESTORS.
 I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'LL SEE A
 NUMBER OF COMPANIES GOING DOWN
 THAT PATH BUT THAT WAS ONE OF
 THEIR GOALS AND IT WORKED FOR
 THEM.
 TO YOUR POINT, WE HAVE SEEN
 COMPANIES STAY PRIVATE LONGER IN
 PART BECAUSE THERE'S A MUCH
 DEEPER PRIVATE MARKET THAN THERE
 WAS 15, 20 YEARS AGO.
 DO YOU REALLY THINK EVEN WITH
 SOME REG CHANGES THAT THAT IS
 GOING TO CHANGE?
 THERE IS AN ARGUMENT THAT SAYS A
 LOT OF THE GROWTH CURVE OCCURS
 WHILE THESE ARE PRIVATE
 COMPANIES AND THEREFORE YOUR
 PUBLIC INVESTORS ARE NOT ABLE TO
 PARTICIPATE IN IT.
 THE GROWTH CURVE IS HAPPENING
 EARLIER IN THE LIFE CYCLE.
 THAT'S WHERE IT IS STEEPEST.
 WE DO WANT TO SEE COMPANIES
 COMING PUBLIC EARLIER.
 I COULD LOOK AT BUILDING OUT A
 PRIVATE MARKET PLATFORM AT THE
 NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE BUT I
 THINK IT'S THE WRONG ANSWER FOR
 INVESTORS AND I THINK THAT
 CONTRIBUTES TO A BIFURCATION OF
 WEALTH THAT WE SEE HERE WHEN THE
 MOST DYNAMIC FASTEST GROWING
 COMPANIES ARE LEFT FOR LARGE
 INVESTORS THAT HAVE ACCESS.
 TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION WHETHER
 OR NOT IT MAKES A CHANGE IF WE
 CHANGE SOME OF THOSE
 REGULATIONS, IT'S PART OF THE
 PROCESS AND I THINK THAT
 CONVEYING THAT MESSAGE TO
 COMPANIES THAT BY PROVIDING
 OPPORTUNITIES FOR INVESTORS TO
 SHARE IN THE SUCCESS, THEY'RE
 ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTING TO WEALTH
 FORMATION IN THIS NATION MORE
 BROADLY IS PART OF THE EQUATION.
 I THINK THAT WILL RESONATE WITH
 SOME PEOPLE.
 STACEY, THANKS.
 THANKS.
 GOOD TO SEE YOU.
 WE'RE GET TO GO THAT TIME.
 IT IS THE HOUR WHERE WE SAY
 WE'RE CLOSE AND I THINK WE'RE ON
 THAT FRONT WE'LL GO TO JON FORTT
 AS WE CONTINUE TO WATCH ZOOM,
 JON.
 Reporter: I JUST GOT A THREE
 MINUTE WARNING ON ZOOM AS YOU
 CAN SEE THE PRICE NOW $63 A
 SHARE.
 THIS PRICED AT 36 LAST NIGHT.
 THAT WOULD BE WELL OVER A 70%
 POP FROM WHERE IT PRICED AND
 PAIRED SHARES, 3.5 MILLION AT
 THIS POINT.
 LET ME TOSS IT OVER TO BERTHA IN
 THE CROWD WITH THE ZOOM FOLKS
 AND WHAT'S GOING ON, HOW FAR WE
 ARE FROM OPENING, BERTHA
 WE'RE GETTING VERY CLOSE.
 THERE IS STILL INTEREST COMING
 IN AND GENERALLY THEY WANT THE
 BOOK TO STABILIZE BEFORE THEY GO
 AHEAD AND OPEN.
 THEY'VE HAD A LOT OF INTEREST
 THAT HAS CONTINUED TO BUILD ALL
 MORNING.
 WE'VE ALREADY PAIRED OVER
 3.5 MILLION SHARES.
 IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'LL PROBABLY
 GET TO 4 MILLION BEFORE THEY
 OPEN HERE BUT IT DOES APPEAR TO
 BE IMMINENT HERE.
 WE ARE WITHIN THE TWO-MINUTE
 WARNING AT THE MOMENT.
 WE'RE WATCHING THE SITUATION.
 JAY HELLER, THE HEAD OF MARKET
 OPERATIONS HERE IS COMMUNICATING
 WITH ALL OF THE FOLKS HERE AS
 WELL AS THE DIFFERENT TRADING
 DESKS ABOUT WHERE WE ARE AT THE
 MOMENT AND WE'RE VERY, VERY
 CLOSE.
 THE COMPANY PRICED AT $36 A
 SHARE WHICH GAVE THEM A
 VALUATION OF $9 BILLION OR SO
 AND THEY ARE LOOKING TO OPEN
 HERE WELL ABOVE THAT VALUATION
 NORTH OF $16 BILLION RIGHT NOW
 IT LOOKS LIKE PERHAPS 70% POP OR
 MORE BUT AGAIN THIS IS ONE OF
 THOSE THINGS THAT IS MORE ART
 THAN SCIENCE AS THEY TRY TO PAIR
 THINGS OFF SO THAT YOU DON'T
 HAVE AN UNSTABLE OPENING.
 BACK OVER TO YOU GUYS.
 JON, I THINK YOU'RE STILL
 WITH US.
 BERTHA JUST SAID IT.
 YOU DO THE MATH ON 268 MILLION
 FULLY DILUTED SHARES AND THAT
 PRICE IS 63 YOU'RE GETTING CLOSE
 TO $17 BILLION MARKET CAP ON A
 COMPANY THAT DID 330 MILLION IN
 REVENUES IN LAST YEAR.
 THOSE MULTIPLES ARE GETTING
 AWFULLY STEEP, AREN'T THEY
 QUITE A MULTIPLE OF REVENUE
 AS YOU MENTIONED, DAVID.
 HERE'S A COMPANY TO PUT THIS IN
 CONTEXT THAT IS COMPETING IN
 BUSINESS AND ENTERPRISE
 COMMUNICATION WITH MICROSOFT,
 WITH CISCO, WITH GOOGLE, WITH
 ADOBE AND HAS BEEN DOING IT
 WELL, GROWING AT MORE THAN 100%
 A YEAR, ALSO DOING -- MANAGE TO
 GO MAKE A PROFIT IN RECENT
 QUARTERS AS WELL.
 SO THAT COMBINATION OF REALLY
 FAST GROWTH, MANAGING
 PROFITABILITY AT THE SAME TIME
 AND AT THE SAME TIME ON GLASS
 D
 GLASSDOOR MANAGED TO BE THE MOST
 POPULAR CEO ON GLASS DDOOR IN

 SO QUITE A MIX THERE.
 CARL
 JON, THANK YOU.
 WE ARE SIMILARLY GET TO GO A
 PRETTY CLOSE POINT ON PINS.
 BOB PISANI BACK AT POST EIGHT,
 BOB?
 Reporter: GETTING A LOT
 CLOSER HERE GUYS WHEN WE GET A
 LOT OF PEOPLE HERE IN THE BOOTH.
 I'M BACK OVER HERE.
 WE'RE GETTING TENSE
 NEGOTIATIONS.
 STILL 23.25, 23.75.
 REMEMBER HOW FAR WE HAVE COME
 HERE, 15 TO 17 PRICING AT $19
 AND NOW LOOKING SOME WHERE IN
 THE $23 RANGE.
 STACEY HAD A VERY GOOD POINT,
 WHAT THEY'RE REALLY INTERESTED
 IN IS A LOT OF SMALLER COMPANIES
 COMING IN.
 WE HAD ONE TODAY.
 DIDN'T GET A LOT OF ATTENTION.
 A BIG MINERAL COMPANY.
 THEY PRICED AT $18.
 THEY OPENED AT $20 AND HERE'S
 ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL IPO.
 WHILE LYFT IS THE EXCEPTION,
 MOST OF THE BIG IPOs THAT HAVE
 COME SINCE LEVI STRAUSS HAVE
 BEEN SUCCESSFUL.
 JU MIA HAD A HUGE IPO.
 PAGERDUTY, LEVI STRAUSS ALSO UP
 ABOUT 40%.
 SO SO FAR THE EARLY INDICATIONS
 THE IPO FLOOD WITH THE EXCEPTION
 OF LYFT TREMENDOUSLY SUCCESSFUL,
 BRINGHAM TODAY.
 WE'RE TRYING TO GET AROUND TO
 THE CORNER THERE, THEY'RE
 ENGAGED IN FAIRLY TENSE
 NEGOTIATIONS SO I WON'T GO OVER
 THERE AND BOTHER THEM.
 I THINK WE'RE GETTING MUCH, MUCH
 CLOSER.
 WHEN YOU GET CLOSE AND THEY SAY
 WE'RE FIVE MINUTES AWAY AND A
 RUSH OF EITHER BUYERS OR SELLERS
 WILL COME IN WHO ARE DECIDED,
 OKAY, IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT'S
 GOING TO MOVE ANY MORE I'M
 PUTTING MY FINAL BID OR OFFER
 IN.
 IT IS A DYNAMIC AUCTION AND WHEN
 PEOPLE THINK THINGS ARE IN
 FINALLY, THAT'S WHEN THEY SHOW
 THEIR HAND.
 IT'S STILL A FLUID SITUATION.
 BACK SOON.
 BOB, IT'S OBVIOUSLY EARLY
 WITH THESE THINGS HAVE NOT EVEN
 OPENED YET, ARE WE STARTING IN
 YOUR MIND TO A RACE THAT NASTY
 TASTE OF LYFT'S DECLINE AFTER
 ITS OPENING DAY?
 PINTEREST IS GOING TO BE THE
 TEST HERE.
 REMEMBER, LYFT WAS 50% ABOVE THE
 LAST VALUATION.
 PINTEREST INITIALLY LOOKED LIKE
 IT WAS ABOUT 25% BELOW --
 LET ME STOP YOU AND LET'S GET
 TO BERTHA COOMBS.
 OPENED.
 [ APPLAUSE ]
 Reporter: GUYS, ZOOM IS NOW
 OPEN HERE AT $65 EVEN AS THEY
 HAVE TREMENDOUS INTEREST STILL
 COMING IN AT THE END OVER ALL
 THIS STOCK PRICE $36 A SHARE
 THAT WAS WELL ABOVE THE UPWARD
 RANGE ALSO AN UPWARD OFFERING AS
 WELL, TREMENDOUS INTEREST IN
 THIS IPO THIS MORNING.
 PINTEREST NOT QUITE YET OPEN BUT
 ZOOM HAVING A STRONG DEBUT.
 JON FORTT IS OVER ON THE OTHER
 SIDE AND HAS A LITTLE MORE HERE,
 JON.
 YES.
 I CAN SEE THE CEO FROM WHERE I
 AM, HE WANT STANDING OVER THERE
 IN THE THRONG WATCHING THE BOOK
 BUILD, HE WAS OVER HAVING
 CONVERSATION INTERESTINGLY WITH
 A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE.
 HE HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON THE
 CULTURE OF THIS COMPANY AS WELL
 AS ON THE GROWTH.
 IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW
 HE PUTS INTO CONTEXT THIS HUGE
 OPENING THAT THEY'VE HAD, OF
 COURSE, THEY'VE PRICED ABOVE THE
 RANGE AND THAT PRICE, 36 HAVE
 BEEN BLOWN OUT FROM WHERE IT'S
 OPENED.
 TRADING AT $64 A SHARE JUST
 ABOVE THERE AND IT'S
 INTERESTING, WE'RE WAITING FOR
 PINTEREST TO OPEN AT THE SAME
 TIME.
 ZOOM WASN'T SEEN IN THE SAME
 CONTEXT BECAUSE IT'S NOT A
 CONSUMER FACING COMPANY.
 IT'S DEALING WITH SMALL BUSINESS
 AND ENTERPRISE, IT'S
 COMMUNICATIONS PLATFORM.
 IT'S A COMPANY COMPETING WITH
 THE LIKES OF MICROSOFT, CISCO,
 ADOBE, GOOGLE, DOING WELL AT IT
 UNDER THE RADAR FOR A WHILE BUT
 NOT ANY MORE AS YOU CAN SEE,
 THIS STOCK IS UP 78% FROM IT'S
 WHERE IT PRICED, GUYS?
 WE MENTION IT HAD LAST HOUR
 AS WELL, BUT THEIR LAST FUNDING
 ROUND BACK IN 2017, A BILLION
 DOLLARS AND THEN YOU LOOK AT
 THIS DEBUT RIGHT NOW, UP 76%.
 TICK
 TICKER SYMBOL, ZM, MY GOSH, WHAT
 A DIFFERENCE A YEAR HAS MADE.
 Reporter: IT LOOKED LIKE IT
 WAS GOING TO BE UNDER THAT AT
 $10 BILLION.
 HERE'S ONE.
 LAST PRIVATE VALUATION, 1 BLD.
 YOU'VE GOT TO DO THE MATH.
 IT'S PROBABLY AROUND 17 TIMES
 IT'S LAST PRIVATE VALUATION, NOT
 TO MENTION THE REVENUE MOST
 RECENT, 12 MONTHS, FOUR QUARTERS
 WORTH OF REVENUE, HAD IT AROUND
 335 MILLION IN REVENUE, QUITE A
 MULTIPLE WHERE IT IS TRADING
 RIGHT NOW.
 IT SHOWS WHAT INVESTORS FEEL
 ABOUT NOT ONLY GROWTH BUT ALSO
 PROFITABILITY, CARL?
 ALL RIGHT, JON, THANK YOU
 VERY MUCH.
 LET'S TAKE STOCK OF WHAT WE
 KNOW SO FAR OF LESLIE PICKER
 WITH THIS AT POST NINE.
 CLEARLY, INVESTORS HUNGRY FOR
 SECULAR GROWTH.
 I WAS SPEAKING WITH SOURCES
 YESTERDAY WHO WERE KIND OF --
 THEY SAID THEY HAD ENOUGH DEMAND
 THAT THEY COULD PRICE THIS THING
 AT 40.
 WANTED TO BE CONSERVATIVE,
 PRICED IT AT 36 AND NOW YOU SEE
 THIS 75% POP AS OF RIGHT NOW ON
 ITS FIRST DAY OF TRADING.
 I WANT TO HONE IN ON HOW RARE
 THIS IS.
 THEY'RE NOT DOUBLING SHARES ON
 THE FIRST DAY OF TRADING.
 WE SEE MAYBE ONE IPO A YEAR
 DOUBLE THEIR STOCK ON THE FIRST
 DAY OF TRADING.
 THIS IS PRETTY REMARKABLE IN
 TERMS OF FIRST DAY PERFORMANCE.
 NOW, IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT
 STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT OFTEN
 TIMES WHEN IPOs COME IN SUPER
 HOT ON THE FIRST DAY OF TRADING
 IT CAN -- IT CAN BE DETRIMENTAL
 FOR THEIR LONGER RUN
 PERFORMANCE.
 I'M NOT SAYING THAT'S GOING TO
 HAPPEN HERE BUT IN THE PAST --
 THERE'S PINTEREST.
 BOB PISANI, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
 Reporter: 23.75.

 PINTEREST GOES PUBLIC AT
 10.6 MILLION SHARES.
 THAT'S A VERY GOOD NUMBER.
 75 MILLION SHARES IS WHAT IS
 BEING SOLD TO THE PUBLIC.
 YOU SAW IT MORE IN 10% THE
 AMOUNT BEING OFFERED RIGHT ON
 THE TOP HERE.
 THERE'S THE POST OVER THERE AND,
 OF COURSE, A LOT OF HAND
 CLAPPING AND CHEERING HERE.
 REMEMBER THE 15 TO 17 WAS THE
 INITIAL PRICING.
 PRICE TALK WENT TO $19 AND
 OPENED AT $23.75.
 YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED WITH ZOOM
 OPENING AT 65, INITIAL TALK
 THERE WAS 28 TO 32 JUST A WEEK
 AGO.
 THREE SUCCESSFUL IPOs JOINING
 THE PARADE THAT WE'VE HAD IN THE
 LAST FEW WEEKS INCLUDING JUMIA,
 ALL STRAYEDING UP 30 OR 40 OR
 50% THE SOLE EXCEPTION LYFT DOWN
 ABOUT 20%.
 BACK TO YOU.
 SUCCESSFUL MORNING.
 CERTAINLY, BOB.
 LESLIE, WHETHER YOU'RE
 LOOKING -- WHEN YOU LOOK AT A
 NAME LIKE PINTEREST WHICH TICKER
 SYMBOL IS PINS, STILL LOSING
 MONEY?
 I'M GOING TO INTERRUPT MYSELF
 AND MIDTHOUGHT HERE AND LET YOU
 KNOW WHO WE'RE STARING AT RIGHT
 NOW.
 THAT'S BEN SILVERMAN, CEO AND
 COFOUNDER OF PINTEREST, GOING TO
 JOIN US HERE AT POST NINE IN
 JUST A FEW MOMENTS AS THIS
 COMPANY BEGINS TRADING PUBLICLY.
 LESLIE, IT WOULD SEEM LOOKING AT
 EITHER ONE OF THESE IPOs TODAY,
 PINTEREST IS STILL LOSING MONEY
 BUT THOSE LOSSES ARE NARROWING.
 IT'S A ONE-TWO IN TERMS OF WHAT
 INVESTORS ARE, I GUESS,
 APPRECIATING IS AND THAT'S
 STRONG REVENUE GROWTH AND EITHER
 PROFIT IN THE CASE OF ZOOM OR
 MOVING CLOSER TO PROFIT IN THE
 CASE OF PINTEREST.
 EXACTLY.
 THEY HAVE TO SEE THAT TREND
 TOWARD PROFITABILITY.
 THEY HAVE TO SEE IT IN SITE.
 THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE PROFITABLE
 PER SE.
 THEY HAVE TO KNOW THE COMPANY
 CAN GET THERE IF IT WANTS TO GET
 THERE.
 WORTH NOTING WITH PINTEREST THAT
 IF YOU LOOK AT ITS ENTERPRISE
 VALUE WHICH IS WHAT I'M TOLD IS
 APPLES TO APPLES WITH ITS LATEST
 PRIVATE SALATION, THIS TRADING
 RIGHT HERE BRINGS PINTEREST TO
 PARODY WITH ITS LATEST PRIVATE
 VALUATION.
 WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT
 HOW IT'S INITIAL RANGE WAS BELOW
 ITS LATEST PRIVATE VALUATION AND
 ABOUT $12 BILLION BACK IN 2017
 WITH A 20% OR HIGHER POP TODAY,
 YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IT MUCH MORE
 IN LINE WITH WHERE IT WAS LAST
 VALUED IN THE PRIVATE MARKETS.
 BOB PISANI, LET'S HEAD BACK
 OVER TO YOU AT POST EIGHT?
 Reporter: I THINK THE
 IMPORTANT THING HERE IS, YES,
 THEY HAVE LOSSES, BUT FAIRLY
 SMALL NUMBERS IN TERMS OF
 LOSSES, $50 MILLION OR
 $60 MILLION COMPARED TO THEIR
 ACTUAL REVENUE BASE IS NOT THAT
 BAD.
 REMEMBER, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
 WITH LYFT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
 $2 BILLION IN REVENUES AND A
 $1 BILLION IN LOSSES.
 WITH UBER WE'RE TALKING
 $11 BILLION IN REVENUE AND
 $3 BILLION IN LOSSES.
 SO THE AMOUNT OF LOSSES FOR
 PINTEREST IS FAIRLY SMALL AND
 THERE'S A VERY, VERY CLEAR ROAD
 TO PROFITABILITY FOR THAT
 COMPANY.
 THIS IS ONE OF THE TWO METRICS
 IN ADDITION TO THE PRICE THAT
 EVERYBODY SEEMS MOST CONCERNED
 ABOUT AND I THINK THIS WAS PART
 OF THE REASON WE SAW SUCH A
 POSITIVE REACTION TO PINTEREST,
 WHICH, BY THE WAY, IS SITTING AT
 $23.24 RIGHT HERE BEHIND ME.
 ESSENTIALLY WHERE WE OPENED AT
 $23.75 IS ACTUALLY WHERE WE
 OPENED AT.
 SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A NUMBER
 OF SMALLER COMPANIES IN THE NEXT
 WEEK.
 WE'VE GOT SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT NEXT
 WEEK.
 THERE'S 230 COMPANIES AS OF TWO
 WEEKS AGO THAT ARE ON THE ROSTER
 TO GO PUBLIC AND I'M REALLY MORE
 INTERESTED IN SOME OF THE
 MIDLEVEL TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES
 LIKE PAGERDUTY, LIKE SOFTWARE
 THAT UNDER VERY HOT SPACES LIKE
 CYBERSECURITY.
 WE'RE SEEING IMMEW KNOW THERAPY
 BIO TECHS COMING IN THE NEXT
 THREE, FOUR OR FIVE MONTHS THAT
 ARE LITERALLY GOING TO CURE
 CANCER.
 IT'S ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING
 THINGS OUT THERE AND UNLIKE THE
 BIOTECH WAVE OF THE 1990s WHERE
 HAD A WAVE OF IPO THAT WERE
 FRANKLY A BUST TO A LARGE
 EXTENT, THESE HAVE TREMENDOUS
 POTENTIAL TO CURE ALL SORTS OF
 DISEASES THAT ARE OUT THERE.
 THIS IS A VERY, VERY EXCITING
 TIME TO COVER THE IPO BUSINESS.
 IT'S MUCH BIGGER THAN UBER AND
 PINTEREST AND YOU WANT TO PAY
 ATTENTION TO THOSE SMALLER
 COMPANIES HERE.
 75 MILLION SHARES IS WHAT THE
 COMPANY ACTUALLY SOLD.
 THAT'S AROUND 12% OR 13% AROUND
 THE ACTUAL FLOAT THAT'S OUT
 THERE.
 ALREADY 21 MILLION SHARES HAVE
 CHANGED HANDS.
 IF YOU WANT -- THE FIRST
 INDICATION OF A SUCCESSFUL IPO
 IS THE PRICE.
 WHAT YOU WANT HERE IS YOU WANT A
 POP AT THE OPEN, 21% IS A LOT,
 BUT 6%, 7%, 8% IS ALWAYS
 DESIRABLE, THEN CLOSING, CARL, A
 LITTLE BIT HIGHER.
 WHEN YOU HAVE THAT, A POP AT THE
 OPEN AND CLOSE HIGHER, BOTTOM
 LINE IS EVERYBODY MAKES MONEY.
 CARL, BACK TO YOU.
 BOB, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
 PINTEREST OPENS FOR TRADE A
 FEW MOMENTS AGO.
 OPENS AT 23.75.
 CURRENTLY JUST SHY -- 23.18.
 COFOUNDER AND CEO OF PINTEREST
 BEN SILVERMAN IS WITH US AT POST
 NINE.
 GOOD TO SEE YOU.
 THANK YOU.
 GIVE INVESTORS A PEAK AT WHAT
 THE ROAD SHOW SOUNDED LIKE WHEN
 YOU MADE YOUR PITCH?
 WHAT WERE THE KEY POINTS
 WE REALLY FOCUSED ON HOW
 PEOPLE USE THE PRODUCTS EVERY
 DAY.
 WE EXPLAINED TO FOLKS THAT
 PEOPLE USE PINTEREST TO GET
 INSPIRATION FROM EVERYTHING TO
 THE RECIPES THEY COOK AND THE
 THINGS THEY PUT IN THEIR HOME.
 IT'S NOT A SOCIAL NETWORK.
 IT'S ABOUT YOURSELF AND YOUR
 DREAMS AND ASPIRATIONS.
 DOES THAT MEAN THAT HIGH
 IMPACT USERS DON'T MATTER IN
 WAYS THEY DO FOR PLATFORMS LIKE
 TWITTER, FOR EXAMPLE
 WE CARE A TON ABOUT OUR
 USERS, BUT WE REALLY THINK ABOUT
 IT UTILITY.
 WE WANT PEOPLE TO USE IT TO GET
 THINGS DONE IN THEIR LIFE.
 WE'RE LESS FOCUSED ON MAKING IT
 A PLACE WHERE YOU TALK TO YOUR
 FRIENDS OR FOLLOW CELEBRITIES.
 A NUMBER OF ANALYSTS AHEAD OF
 THIS IPO TODAY HAVE COME OUT AND
 SAID DESPITE THE FACT THAT I
 KNOW PINTEREST HAS BEEN
 DISTANCING ITSELF FROM THAT
 SOCIAL MEDIA CATEGORY HAVE COME
 OUT AND MADE THE ARGUMENT THAT,
 BEING CATEGORIZED ALONGSIDE SOME
 OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA NAMES COULD
 BE A USEFUL BENCH MARK FOR
 VALUATION.
 WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT?
 WE'RE JUST REALLY FOCUSED ON
 MAKING IT CLEAR HOW PEOPLE
 ACTUALLY USE THE PRODUCT.
 THE REASON WE FOCUS ON THINGS
 LIKE INSPIRATION AND PLANNING IN
 THE FUTURE IS IT'S THE BEST
 REPRESENTATION OF HOW PEOPLE ARE
 USING IT EVERY DAY.
 YOU HAVE A NEW CONSTITUENCY
 TODAY AMONGST THE VARIOUS ONES
 THAT YOU SERVICE AND THAT WOULD
 BE PUBLIC SHAREHOLDERS.
 DO YOU -- HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT
 HOW YOU'RE GOING TO GO ABOUT
 CHANGING THE WAY YOU DO YOUR JOB
 IF AT ALL GIVING YOU'RE NOW A
 PUBLIC COMPANY
 OUR GOAL IS JUST TO CONTINUE
 FOCUSING ON MAKING THE PRODUCT
 GREAT OVER THE LONG-TERM AND WE
 WANT TO HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP
 WITH OUR INVESTORS AND MAKE SURE
 THAT THEY UNDERSTAND WHERE WE'RE
 HEADED AND THAT WAY I THINK
 WE'LL BOTH BE ON THE SAME SIDE
 AND IT'LL BE A WIN-WIN FOR
 EVERYONE.
 WE'LL BE FOLLOWING THE
 COMPANY FROM HERE ON AS WELL.
 WHAT WOULD YOU TELL US SHOULD BE
 OUR FOCUS IN TERMS OF THE
 PROGRESS THAT YOU'RE MAKING
 TOWARDS YOUR GOALS WHEN WE LOOK
 AT VARIOUS METRICS AT PINTEREST?
 YOU KNOW, WHEN I RUN THE
 COMPANY AS THE CEO, I ALWAYS
 FOCUS ON HOW PEOPLE USE THE
 PRODUCT FIRST.
 SO WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON
 CONTINUING TO GROW GLOBALLY.
 WE ALSO WANT PINTEREST TO BE A
 GREAT PLACE FOR BUSINESSES TO
 INSPIRE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ON
 THE PLATFORM.
 THOSE ARE THE TWO KEY PLAYERS
 AND I WOULD FOCUS ON THOSE.
 WHICH MEANS WHAT?
 WEEKLY USERS, LENGTH OF ENGAGE
 WE SHARED WITH INVESTORS THAT
 WE OFTEN LOOK AT MAUs AS AN
 INDICATION OF HOW MANY PEOPLE
 ARE USING THE PRODUCT AND WE
 LOOK AT THE AVERAGE REVENUE PER
 USER.
 IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO
 MONETIZE THE USERS' YOU
 CURRENTLY HAVE ON THE SITE RIGHT
 NOW AND I REALIZE FROM AN
 ADVERTISING STANDPOINT THE FOLKS
 THAT DO COME AND USE PINTEREST
 TEND TO BE READY TO MAKE A
 PURCHASE.
 YOU ROLLED OUT CATALOGS, MORE
 SHOPPING FEATURES, BUT LONGER
 TERM WHAT DOES THAT -- I GUESS
 WHAT DOES THAT PRODUCING
 OPPORTUNITY LOOK LIKE ON THE
 PLATFORM
 THE REALLY COOL THING ABOUT
 ADVERTISING ON PINTEREST IS THAT
 PEOPLE ARE THERE TO GET
 INSPIRATION AND DO THINGS AND
 THAT OFTEN MEANS BUYING.
 SO OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS
 AND FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE
 WE'LL WORK ON BRIDGING THAT GAP
 BETWEEN SEEING SOMETHING
 INSPIRATIONAL AND FINDING A
 PRODUCT FROM A RETAILER THAT YOU
 TRUST AT A PRICE POINT THAT
 MAKES SENSE FOR YOU.
 YOU GUYS HAD VIABLE PINS NOT
 LONG AGO BUYING THE ABILITY TO
 BUY WAS MORE INTEGRATED IN
 PINTEREST AND INTERESTINGLY YOU
 GUYS STEPPED BACK FROM THAT.
 TELL ME WHAT WAS THE THINKING
 BEHIND THAT.
 WHAT IS IT THAT SAY ABOUT YOUR
 STRATEGY, WHAT'S IMPORTANT AND
 WHAT'S NOT IMPORTANT
 WE THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT
 THING FROM A USERS' PERSPECTIVE,
 THEY CAN GO FROM INSPIRATION TO
 ACTION.
 WE'RE FOCUSED ON MATCHING THOSE
 INSPIRATIONAL IMAGES WITH
 PRODUCTS THAT ARE INSIDE THOSE
 IMAGES AND DOING IT FROM A BUNCH
 OF DIFFERENT RETAILERS AND
 THAT'S OUR FOCUS RIGHT NOW.
 I THINK TRANSACTIONS, THOSE MAY
 COME OUT IN THE FUTURE BUT WE
 DON'T HAVE ANY PLANS TO RELEASE
 THAT RIGHT NOW.
 HUGE DEBATE SWIRLING ABOUT
 DIFFERENT CLASSES OF STOCK ON
 NEW ISSUES AND THE DIFFERENCES
 IN VOTING RIGHTS.
 WHY DO THAT THIS TIME?
 WHY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
 B & A?
 WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE
 RUNNING THE COMPANY FOR A
 LONG-TERM AND --
 ARE YOU WORRIED THAT THE
 PUBLIC MIGHT HAVE OR
 INSTITUTIONS COMING IN TO THE
 ISSUE WOULD HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS
 ABOUT HOW TO RUN IT THAN YOU
 WOULD?
 I THINK FOR THE MOST PART
 THERE SHOULD BE GREAT ALIGNMENT
 BUT I DEFINITELY TRUST -- KNOW
 WHERE WE WANT TO TAKE IT IN THE
 FUTURE.
 WHEN YOU FIRST HELPED FOUND
 THE COMPANY, WHAT WAS YOUR IDEA?
 WHAT WAS YOUR INTENT
 WHAT NEED DID YOU THINK YOU WERE
 GOING TO FILL?
 AT THE VERY BEGINNING WHAT WE
 NOTICED THERE WAS A LOT OF
 PEOPLE THAT COLLECT THINGS AND
 COLLECTIONS SAY A LOT ABOUT WHO
 YOU ARE.
 I USED TO COLLECT BUGS AS A KID
 WHICH I DIDN'T THINK WOULD
 FOLLOW ME INTO ADULTHOOD, BUT IT
 DID.
 BUGS?
 BUGS.
 IT'S AN AMAZING WAY TO DISCOVER
 THINGS THAT YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE
 EVER SEEN BEFORE.
 WAS THERE -- IN TERMS OF THE
 COMPANIES, THE BRAND NAMES THAT
 PLAY ON IT NOW, RIGHT, AND HAVE
 INTEREST IN WORKING WITH PEOPLE
 WITH FOLLOWERS, WAS THERE A
 PATIENT ZERO, ONE THAT PUT YOU
 ON THE MAP AS FAR AS YOU WERE
 CONCERNED?
 IT'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT MORE
 OF A SLOW AND STEADY PROGRESS.
 WHERE WE STARTED WAS WITH
 BUSINESSES THAT WERE REALLY
 ALIGNED WITH WHAT PEOPLE WERE
 DOING.
 A LOT OF FOLKS IN RETAIL, A LOT
 OF FOLKS IN CONSUMER PRODUCTS
 GOODS.
 OVER THE LAST YEAR OR SO WE
 STARTED TO EXPAND THAT BOTH TO
 NEW DIFFERENT TYPES OF
 ADVERTISERS AND ALSO
 INTERNATIONALLY WHERE ABOUT
 TWO-THIRDS OF OUR USERS ARE
 TODAY.
 TALK ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL
 OPPORTUNITY IN TERMS OF THE
 REVENUE GROWTH THAT YOU EXPECT
 THERE.
 IS THERE A CULTURAL DIFFERENCE
 IN THE WAY PEOPLE USE IT
 WHAT'S YOUR APPROACH THERE GIVEN
 INTERNATIONAL IS AN IMPORTANT
 PART OF THE GROWTH OPPORTUNITY
 THAT CERTAINLY INVESTORS SEE FOR
 THE COMPANY?
 THE FUNNY THING IS PEOPLE ARE
 A LOT MORE THE SAME THAN THEY
 ARE DIFFERENT.
 HERE IN THE U.S., PEOPLE LOVE TO
 USE PINTEREST FOR THE FOOD THEY
 EAT, FOR DECORATING, FORGETTING
 INSPIRATION.
 WE SEE THE SAME THING
 INTERNATIONALLY.
 NOW THE CONTENT IS DIFFERENT.
 FOLKS IN FRANCE, THEY WANT
 FRENCH RESPIES.
 THEY DON'T WANT AMERICAN
 CASSEROLES, SO THERE'S WORK WE
 DO TO MAKE SURE THE CONTENT
 FEELS RELEVANT.
 WHEN WE GOT TOGETHER A FEW
 WEEKS AGO YOU INDICATED I THINK
 THAT YOU MAKE VISITS TO PEOPLES'
 HOMES.
 IS THAT RIGHT?
 ARE YOU STILL DOING THAT
 DO YOU STILL ANTICIPATE DOING
 THAT
 AND WHY DO YOU DO THAT
 THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR
 A CONSUMER COMPANY IS TO MAKE
 SURE THEY REALLY UNDERSTAND THE
 NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE
 USING IT AND MAYBE THE NEEDS OF
 THE PEOPLE THAT HAVEN'T STARTED
 USING IT YET.
 ME AND MY COFOUNDER, EVAN, WE
 MAKE A HABIT OF GOING TO A FEW
 CITIES, IT'S NOT A PRESS TOUR
 AND WE JUST SIT DOWN WITH PEOPLE
 IN THEIR HOMES TO FIND OUT HOW
 PINTEREST IS FITTING IN THEIR
 LIVES.
 THIS IS JUST A BREWING DEBATE
 LAWMAKERS, ADVERTISERS, SOCIETY
 AT LARGE IN TERMS OF
 MISINFORMATION AND HOW TECH
 COMPANIES AND PLATFORMS LIKE
 YOURS ARE ADDRESSING IT.
 HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT AND
 I GUESS HOW DO YOU STAY
 PROACTIVE ABOUT THAT WHEN
 SOMETHING LIKE ANTIVACCINATION
 INFORMATION JUST SEEMS TO BE
 WHACK-A-MOLE
 PROVIDING INSPIRATION HIGH
 QUALITY CONTENT IS INCREDIBLY
 IMPORTANT.
 ON ANTIVACCINATION, WE'RE NOT
 THE BEST PLACE TO GET MEDICAL
 INFORMATION SO IT'S NOT OUR
 RESPONSIBILITY TO BE SERVING
 THINGS UP SO WE PUT A PAUSE ON
 THAT.
 WE DON'T CLAIM TO BE A FREE
 SPEECH PLATFORM OR A PLACE WHERE
 ANYONE CAN PUBLISH ANYTHING.
 IT'S ALWAYS ONGOING.
 IT'S NOT A ONE AND DONE THING.
 WE ARE IN A CHAPTER WHERE
 WE'RE ON HEIGHTENED ALERT FOR
 THINGS LIKE TECH REGULATION IN
 THIS COUNTRY, CERTAINLY IN
 EUROPE AND COUNTRIES LIKE
 AUSTRALIA FOR THINGS LIKE
 OFFENSIVE CONTENT AND PRIVACY
 BREACHES AND SO FORTH, DOES
 PINTEREST SEE THEMSELVES AS
 IMMUNED TO WHATEVER REGULATION
 MAY COME DOWN THE LINE
 I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT
 REGULATIONS IS COMING DOWN THE
 LINE.
 WE'D ALL LIKE TO KNOW.
 THERE ARE A LOT OF CHANGES
 HAPPENING AND IN GENERAL, A LOT
 OF CHANGES ARE HAPPENING FOR THE
 BETTER.
 PEOPLE LIKE PINTEREST -- LIKE WE
 TOUCHED LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF
 MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AND SO WE
 WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR
 PLATFORM IS ACTING RESPONSIBLY
 AND IN THE BROADER INDUSTRY THAT
 FEELING IN GENERAL IS SHARED.
 HAVE YOU HAD TO ADD STAFF OR
 GUARD RAILS THAT MANAGE CONTENT
 OR KEEP CONTENT IN A CERTAIN
 LANE
 WE'VE ALWAYS HAD FOLKS THAT
 FOCUS ON CONTENT SAFE AND WE
 PLAN TO CONTINUE DOING THAT.
 IT'S JUST PART OF THE TERRITORY.
 IT'S NOT A ONE AND DONE THING.
 IT'S AN ONGOING INVESTMENT
 THAT'S ALWAYS GOING TO MATTER.
 WE'RE WATCHING YOUR STOCK HIT
 I THINK NEW HIGHS, UP 29%.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK IN TERMS OF
 WHERE IT WAS PRICED AND WHERE
 IT'S TRADING RIGHT NOW
 YOU KNOW, I REALLY AM JUST
 FOCUSED ON WHERE IT GOES
 LONG-TERM.
 WE'RE DLIEDED THAT THE OPENING'S
 HAPPENING AND IT'S A FUN
 MILESTONE.
 WE'RE NOT OVERLY FIXATED ON THE
 DAY-TO-DAY MOVEMENTS.
 AS YOU SHOULDN'T BE.
 TO BE FAIR WHILE PEOPLE HAVE
 CERTAINLY LOOKED AT YOU AND SAY
 YOU'RE A FOUNDER, TODAY ON PAPER
 YOU'RE WORTH AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT
 OF MONEY, DOES IT CHANGE THE WAY
 YOU THINK ABOUT THERMZ AT ALL
 AND YOUR APPROACH DAY-TO-DAY
 I DON'T THINK SO.
 PINTEREST FROM THE START WAS A
 PRODUCT THAT MANY OF MY
 COFOUNDERS WANTED TO MAKE FIRST
 FOR OUFRZ AND THEN FOR ALL THE
 PEOPLE THAT USE IT AND THAT'S
 ALWAYS BEEN THE DRIVING
 MOTIVATION BEHIND T.
 WE'RE REALLY JUST EXCITED THAT
 NOW THAT WE'RE A PUBLICLY TRADED
 COMPANY WE HAVE MORE RESOURCES
 THAT WILL ENABLE DOUSE THAT AND
 WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THE FUTURE.
 WAS THERE EVER A DEBATE ABOUT
 WHETHER YOU WOULD GO PUBLIC ONE
 DAY IF YOU COULD
 WERE YOU A PROPONENT OF THAT
 FROM THE BEGINNING
 I DON'T THINK WE EVER
 CONTEMPLATED THAT IN THE
 BEGINNING.
 IT'S SURREAL TO BE HERE AT THE
 NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE.
 WE'RE JUST APPRECIATIVE OF THE
 OPPORTUNITY AND EXCITED ABOUT
 THE FUTURE.
 LAST THING I HAVE TO ASK YOU,
 PAST OR PROFITABILITY,
 EXPECTATIONS OR TARGETS
 INVESTORS SHOULD BE WATCHING FOR
 THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS
 OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS,
 I'M EXCITED THE BUSINESS HAS
 MADE A TON OF PROGRESS.
 WE'VE BUILT OUT THE AD BUSINESS.
 WE PLAN TO CONTINUE OPERATING IT
 THAT WAY.
 WE MENTIONED EARLIER THAT WE
 SAW YOU ON CODE CONFERENCE TWO
 SUMMERS AGO MAYBE.
 MAYBE THREE.
 TIME FLIES, BUT YOU HAVE NOT
 BEEN, I WOULD ARGUE, WIDELY
 PUBLIC IN YOUR APPEARANCES.
 ARE WE GOING TO SEE MORE OF YOU?
 ARE YOU PREPARED FOR THAT
 COMPONENT OF LEADING THE
 COMPANY?
 I DON'T KNOW.
 I'LL HAVE TO FIND OUT.
 ARE YOU GOING TO COME BACK
 HERE, FOR EXAMPLE?
 I'LL PROBABLY COME BACK.
 I AM PRETTY FOCUSED ON OUR USERS
 AND THE PRODUCT.
 I THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE FOR
 THE COMPANY.
 WE HOPE YOU'LL COME BACK.
 THANK YOU.
 I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
 THANK YOU.
 CONGRATULATIONS.
 THANKS.
 BEN SILVERMAN OF PINTEREST.
 I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SWITCH
 OUR FOCUS TO ZOOM, AM I RIGHT
 ABOUT THAT
 WHICH, OF COURSE, OPENED AT THE
 NASDAQ TODAY.
 OPENING TRADE OF 65.
 JON FORTT'S GOT THAT.
 I AM HERE AT THE NASDAQ WHERE
 ZOOM OPENED FOR TRADE JUST
 MINUTES AGO, QUITE A POP.
 RIGHT NOW IT IS UP ABOUT 75%
 FROM WHERE IT PRICED AND I'M
 WITH FOUNDER AND CEO ERIC YUAN,
 CONGRATULATIONS.
 THANK YOU.
 A COUPLE YEARS AGO PINTEREST
 WAS VALUED RIGHT AROUND WHERE IT
 IS NOW AROUND $12 BILLION.
 YOU WERE LESS THAN A BILLION
 DOLLARS.
 TODAY THE PUBLIC MARKETS HAVE
 GIVEN YOU A VALUATION HIGHER NAN
 THEIRS, ARE YOU SURPRISED?
 YES, I'M VERY SURPRISED.
 OUR HARD WORK -- WE NEVER
 THOUGHT ABOUT THIS AS A PRICE
 BUT, AGAIN, WE ARE PRICE IS OUT
 OF OUR CONTROL.
 YOU SAID THAT YOU COULD HAVE
 MADE GROWN FASTER, CERTAINLY
 GROWN YOUR WORKFORCE FASTER BUT
 YOU'VE BEEN CAREFUL OF THE
 CULTURE, YOU'VE ALSO MANAGED TO
 BE PROFITABLE.
 RIGHT NOW INVESTORS CLEARLY
 EXPECT A BREAK NECK PACE OF
 GROWTH FROM YOU, WHAT DOES THIS
 IPO DO TO THE WAY YOU LOOK AT
 GROWTH
 I THINK, FIRST OF ALL, WE
 STARTED FROM S&P CUSTOMERS.
 WE REALLY WANT TO HAVE OUR --
 REALLY HELP OUR COMPANY BRAND.
 WITH THAT, OUR ENTERPRISE WILL
 TAKE OFF FROM HERE.
 HOW DETERMINED ARE YOU TO
 REMAIN INDEPENDENT
 I THINK REALLY BOILS DOWN TO
 OUR EMPLOYEES.
 I ALWAYS TOLD OUR EMPLOYEES, IF
 YOU'RE VERY HAPPY AND DO ALL YOU
 BEING, I THINK WE'LL BE OKAY.
 ENTERPRISES USE TO CHART HOW
 SUCCESSFUL THEY ARE, YOU GUYS
 SCORED PRETTY HIGH BUT YOU'RE UP
 AGAINST THE LIKES OF CISCO.
 YEP.
 MICROSOFT, ADOBE, ET CETERA.
 HOW DO YOU LOOK AT BIG COMPANY
 COMPETITION, WHAT'S GOING TO
 CONTINUE TO GIVE YOU AN EDGE NOW
 THAT YOU'RE PUBLICLY TRADED?
 THOSE COMPANIES ARE ALL GREAT
 COMPANIES.
 I ADMIRE THEM A LOT.
 MOST OF TIME WE DO NOT SPEND,
 YOU KNOW, LOOKING AT
 COMPETITORS.
 WE SPEND TIME TO CARE ABOUT OUR
 CUSTOMERS.
 WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S THE
 PINPOINT FROM A CUSTOMER SIDE.
 WE WANT TO BE THE FIRST COMPANY
 TO UNDERSTAND THE CUSTOMER'S
 PINPOINT.
 TO COME UP WITH A SOLUTION TO
 TAKE CARE OF THE CUSTOMER.
 IF WE KEEP DOING, THAT THE
 CUSTOMERS WILL TRUST US.
 WE DO ALL WE CAN TO MAKE SURE
 OUR CUSTOMER HAPPY.
 I BELIEVE ABOUT 18% OF YOUR
 BUSINESS IS INTERNATIONAL AT
 THIS POINT, IS THAT RIGHT?
 THAT'S RIGHT.
 IF YOU'RE GOING TO GROW, A
 LOT THAT HAVE GROWTH IS GOING TO
 HAVE TO COME INTERNATIONALLY.
 DOES THE PREMIUM MODEL YOU'VE
 HAD WORK AS WELL OUTSIDE THE
 U.S. AS IT HAS INSIDE?
 ABSOLUTELY.
 ANYWHERE FROM JAPAN, EUROPE,
 JUST GO TO OUR WEBSITE AND FOR
 THE BIG ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS,
 OUR REPS CAN TALK WITH THEM.
 THERE'S NO LIMITATION IN TERMS
 OF WHERE WE SHOULD OFFER OUR
 SERVICE.
 ANYWHERE YOU CAN SUBSCRIBE TO
 ZOOM SERVICE.
 I BELIEVE ABOUT 55% OF THE
 334 CUSTOMERS YOU HAVE THAT ARE
 PAYING LAST YEAR MORE THAN
 $100,000 FOR ZOOM SERVICES, THEY
 CAME IN FIRST THROUGH SOME FREE
 ACCOUNT.
 IS THAT NUMBER GOING TO STAY
 THAT HIGH OR DO YOU HAVE TO HIRE
 MORE SALES PEOPLE TO FUEL
 GROWTH
 I THINK IT'LL BE HIGHER.
 TO BE A PUBLIC COMPANY, MORE
 BRAND AWARENESS, WORKING HARDER.
 I THINK THAT NUMBER WILL BE MUCH
 HIGHER DOWN THE ROAD.
 WHY IT SALES FORCE TOSS IN
 $100 MILLION
 WE REALLY WANTED TO EMBED
 ZOOM IN OUR BUSINESS
 APPLICATIONS.
 THAT'S WHY WE -- ALL THE REPS
 LIVE ON PLATFORM TO HAVE MUCH
 BETTER INTEGRATION BETWEEN ZOOM.
 I THINK THAT'S A NEW BRAND FOR
 US TO WORK THEM ALL CLOSELY.
 WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE ECONOMY
 TURNS DOWN
 WHEN THEY'RE MAKING MONEY, WHEN
 THERE'S MONEY TO GO AFTER, SPARE
 NO EXPENSE TO COORDINATE TO
 UNDERSTAND WHAT REGIONS TO GO.
 WHEN THE ECONOMY TURNS DOWN AND
 IT'S BEEN HOT FOR A DECADE, WHAT
 HAPPENS?
 IF A ECONOMY TURNS DOWN,
 GUESS WHAT
 NOBODY'S GOING TO TRAVEL ANY
 MORE.
 EVERYBODY'S GOING TO USE ZOOM.
 I THINK IT'S BETTER FOR US.
 I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT YOUR
 OWN JOURNEY TO THIS POINT.
 I'M NOT SURE YOU EXPECTED A FEW
 MONTHS AGO NECESSARILY TO BE
 MONTHS AGO TO BE A PAPER
 BILLIONAIRE, BUT YOU ARE TODAY
 WITH THE STOCK DOING WHAT IT'S
 DOING.
 AND CERTAINLY A FEW YEARS AGO
 WHEN YOU WERE LOOKING TO GET
 INTO THE U.S., YOUR VISA WAS
 DENIED SEVERAL TIMES
 EIGHT TIMES.
 WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE ON THE
 DAY YOUR COMPANY IS GOING PUBLIC
 TO PEOPLE WHO ARE CRAFTING
 POLICY ON IMMIGRATION?
 I WOULD SAY, YOU KNOW, THE
 UNITED STATES IS A GREAT
 COUNTRY, AMERICAN DREAM.
 I THINK ALL OF THE PATHS IS AN
 OPEN CULTURE ON IMMIGRATION CAN
 COME HERE.
 I THINK IT'S ALWAYS GOOD, AN
 OPEN CULTURE TO EMBRACE ALL OF
 THE PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE
 WORLD, DIVERSITY IS ALWAYS GOOD.
 I THINK IT IS SUCH A SHORT-TERM
 PROBLEM.
 I THINK I HAVE A HIGH
 CONFIDENCE
 I'M VERY OPTIMISTIC.
 THIS AMERICAN CULTURE I THINK
 WILL LAST FOREVER.
 YOU HAVE A VIDEO CONFERENCING
 PRODUCT WHICH YOU SAID WILL
 ALLOW PEOPLE NOT TO NECESSARILY
 HAVE TO TRAVEL, YET YOU'RE BASED
 IN SAN JOSE.
 A CITY I KNOW WELL
 I LIVED THERE ABOUT 14 YEARS
 IT'S EXPENSIVE THERE
 DO YOU STAY IN SILICON VALLEY?
 IS IT IMPORTANT TO BE THERE WHEN
 TECHNOLOGIES LIKE YOURS ALLOW
 YOU TO LIVE ANYWHERE
 I THINK WITH ZOOM, VIDEO
 CONFERENCING YOU CAN LIVE
 ANYWHERE WITH ANY DEVICE, TALK
 WITH CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS.
 THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT
 COMPANIES -- WHEN WE STARTED
 MANY YEARS AGO, WE DID NOT HAVE
 PHYSICAL OFFICE.
 WE LIVED ON ZOOT PLATFORM.
 I THINK MUCH BETTER EMPLOYEE
 ENGAGEMENT, THE COST, EMPLOYEES
 HAVE MORE FLEXIBLE TIME.
 I DON'T THINK THERE ARE ANY
 ISSUES TO LIVING IN A ZOOM
 PLATFORM
 CAN YOU LIVE ANYWHERE AND WORK
 TOGETHER TODAY.
 WHAT'S YOUR TAKE ON THE
 AMERICAN ECONOMY, NOT ONLY
 POWERING YOUR GROWTH RIGHT NOW
 BUT HELPING THIS COMPANY BECOME
 WHAT IT IS
 I'M VERY OPTIMISTIC
 I THINK AMERICA'S ECONOMY WILL
 DO BETTER AND BETTER IN THE
 FUTURE
 IT'S A GREAT CULTURE, OPEN
 CULTURE.
 EVERYBODY'S WORKING VERY HARD.
 I THINK BRIGHT FUTURE AHEAD OF
 US.
 ERIC YUAN, FOUNDER AND CEO OF
 ZOOM
 I WILL MAKE THE IS LONG REACH
 AND SHAKE YOUR HAND.
 BIG DAY FOR YOU AND IPOs IN
 GENERAL.
 CONGRATULATIONS.
 BACK TO YOU.
 JOHN, TO THAT POINT THE OTHER
 BIG DEBUT HAS BEEN PINTEREST
 THAT'S A NICE SPLIT SCREEN OF
 THE TWO BIG ISSUES TODAY
 BOTH CONTINUING TO SURGE IN
 EARLY TRADING.
 PINTEREST'S CEO DID SKPLOIN US A
 FEW MOMENTS AGO AND EXPLAIN WHAT
 THAT MEANS FOR ALL INVESTORS.
 OUR GOAL IS FOCUS ON MAKING
 THE PRODUCT GREAT IN THE LONG
 TERM AND HAVE A GOOD
 RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR INVESTORS
 AND MAKE SURE THEY UNDERSTAND
 WHERE WE'RE HEADED AND I THINK
 WE WILL BOTH BE ON THE SAME SIDE
 AND WIN-WIN FOR EVERYONE.
 INTERESTING TO HEAR HIM
 RESPONDING ABOUT ANTI-VAX,
 SAYING WE'RE NOT A FREE SPEECH
 FORUM.
 WE GO BACK TO THE ARGUMENT
 AND POINT PINTEREST IS MAKING
 THEY'RE NOT A SOCIAL MEDIA
 COMPANY AND THEY'RE MUCH MORE
 FOCUSED ON ENGAGEMENT AND PINS
 AND BASICALLY DRIVING
 ADVERTISING REVENUE TIED TO A
 USER BASE THAT COMES WITH A VERY
 HIGH INTENT TO ACTUALLY MAKE
 PURCHASES.
 LOOKING AT SHARES OF PINTEREST
 UP 27%
 INCREDIBLE DAY AT BOTH EXCHANGES
 ON THE HEELS OF THIS
 I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING IN
 OUR CONVERSATION WITH SILBERMANN
 WHEN HE SAID HE GOES AND HE
 VISITS WITH CONSUMERS AT THEIR
 HOUSES TO GET A FEEL WHAT
 THEY'RE INTERESTED IN.
 YES, ZEROED IN ON MAUs AS
 METRIC TO WATCH, TALKED ABOUT
 DEFENDING QUITE PLAINLY THE DUAL
 CLASS STRUCTURE AND THESE
 SPECIAL BILLING RIGHTS FOR CLASS
 B, WHICH THE PUBLIC IS NOT
 BUYING TODAY
 LET'S GET BACK TO THE NASDAQ
 JOHN FORD, AS WE PAY ATTENTION
 TO WHAT HAPPENED OVER THERE
 TODAY.
 THANK YOU, CARL
 I'M HERE NOW WITH NASDAQ CEO
 DINA FRIEDMAN.
 THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE.
 THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING
 HERE
 IT'S BEEN A BIG MORNING.
 IT'S BEEN A BIG MORNING FOR
 IPOs
 I THINK ZOOM TURNED OUT BIGGER
 THAN A LOT OF PEOPLE EXPECTED.
 CLEARLY UP 75% RIGHT NOW
 WHAT DOES THE PROCESS LOOK LIKE
 FROM WHERE YOU'RE SITTING?
 I THINK, FIRST, IT COMES DOWN
 TO THE COMPANY AND ZOOM AS AN
 ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE BUSINESS
 DEMONSTRATED THEY CAN GROW, THEY
 HAVE RESILIENCY AND LOYALTY
 AMONG THEIR CLIENTS.
 THEIR SOLUTION IS QUITE STICKY
 ONCE IT'S INTEGRATED INTO YOUR
 OFFICE AND WORK FLOWS, IT'S A
 VERY STICKY BUSINESS
 I THINK THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO
 DEMONSTRATE THAT ON THE ROAD AND
 DONE A GREAT JOB OF BRINGING IN
 INVESTORS.
 I HAVE TO ASK ABOUT PROCESSES
 AGAIN BECAUSE YOU HAD LYFT ABOUT
 THREE WEEKS AGO.
 THE NASDAQ'S JOB IS MAKE SURE
 THINGS OPEN SMOOTHLY
 IT DID THAT.
 BUT THEN THE PRICE HAS JUST
 TANKED, PRICE DISCOVERY WISE
 IT'S BEEN THE TALK OF A NUMBER
 OF COMPANIES LOOKING TO GO
 PUBLIC
 WHAT HAPPENED THERE?
 FIRST OF ALL, WE'RE VERY
 PROUD TO HAVE LYFT AS PART OF
 OUR LIST OF COMPANIES, AND THEY
 ARE GREAT BUSINESS IN AND OF
 THEMSELVES
 I THINK THEY HAVE A LONG-TERM
 VISION
 IT'S VERY IMPORTANT INVESTORS
 EVALUATE THESE COMPANIES OVER
 THE LONG TERM AND THEIR ABILITY
 TO EXECUTE ON WHAT THEY DO
 DISCUSS WHILE THEY'RE ON THE
 ROAD
 IT'S VERY EARLY DAYS FOR LYFT.
 THEY HAVE A LONG ROAD, NO PUN
 INTENDED, TO GO DOWN TO MAKE
 SURE THEY'RE EXECUTING ON WHAT
 THEIR PLANS ARE.
 BUT THEY HAVE BIG PLANS, AND I
 THINK THEY'VE DONE A GREAT JOB
 OF EXECUTION ACROSS THEIR
 BUSINESS SO FAR.
 I BELIEVE IT'SREALLY IMPORTANT
 TO LOOK AT THEM OVER THE LONG
 TERM AND NOT JUST THE LAST FEW
 WEEKS.
 HAS THERE BEEN ANY CHANGE IN
 THE WAY YOU COMMUNICATE OR THAT
 COMPANIES LOOKING TO IPO HAVE
 COMMUNICATED WITH YOU BASED ON
 HOW THAT PRICE DISCOVERY PROCESS
 HAS GONE ON WITH A COMPANY LIKE
 THAT
 WHAT ARE YOU TELLING THEM?
 WHAT ARE THEY ASKING YOU
 YES, FIRST OF ALL I DO
 BELIEVE MOST COMPANIES
 UNDERSTAND EVERY IPO IS ITS OWN
 STORY.
 THEY LOOK AT THEIR OWN BUSINESS
 MODEL, THEY LOOK AT THEIR OWN
 ACCESS TO INVESTORS AND CAPITAL,
 THE CONVERSATIONS THEY HAD WITH
 INVESTORS AND ADVISERS AND THEY
 DO RECOGNIZE THAT THEIR STORY
 WILL BE ITS OWN MAKING
 SO THEY HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT
 THEY HAVE A LONG-TERM VIEW
 THEY HAVE A LONG-TERM PLAN
 I DON'T BELIEVE, QUALIFICATIONS
 WITH CLIENTS HAVE NOT CHANGED ON
 THE BASIS OF ONE IPO
 THEY'RE LOOKING AT THIS OVER THE
 LONG TERM TO KNOW THERE'S A
 HEALTHY MARKET, HEALTHY DEMAND
 OVERALL FOR COMPANIES.
 HOW HEALTHY IS THE IPO MARKET
 RIGHT NOW?
 AND DO YOU EXPECT THE
 CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT HEALTH
 TO SHIFT BASED ON WHAT HAPPENED
 HERE TODAY
 I THINK, FIRST OF ALL, IT'S
 BEEN HEALTHY FOR A WHILE
 SO WE HAD 118 OOIPOs LAST YEAR D
 50 SO FAR THIS YEAR.
 IT'S A HEALTHY MARKETPLACE
 THERE'S A LOT OF PENT-UP DEMAND
 STILL, GIVEN THE COMPANIES THAT
 WANT TO COME OUT THIS YEAR
 SO I WOULD SAY IT'S BEEN PRETTY
 STEADY
 WE HAD THAT ONE TIME DURING THE
 FOURTH QUARTER THAT PEOPLE GOT A
 LITTLENERVOUS ABOUT HOW THINGS
 WOULD LOOK GOING INTO '19 AND IT
 JUST RECOVERED
 SO IT'S BEEN A STRONG
 ENVIRONMENT FOR IPOs
 AND OBVIOUSLY TODAY IS A GREAT
 DAY FOR THE MARKETS IN GENERAL
 BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO
 REFLECTIVE, AGAIN, OF THE STORY
 OF ZOOM AND THE STRENGTH OF
 THEIR BUSINESS.
 SOME YEARS AGO NOT TOO LONG
 AGO THERE WAS TALK ABOUT
 REGULATION AND LOGGING DOWN THE
 IPO MARKET, THAT COMPANIES WERE
 NOT GOING TO WANT TO GO PUBLIC
 WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT?
 I ACTUALLY STILL THINK THERE
 ARE SOME REAL IMPEDIMENTS TO
 COMPANIES WANTING TO TAP THE
 PUBLIC MARKETS EARLIER IN THEIR
 LIFE CYCLE
 THE COMPANIES COMING OUT NOW ARE
 MULTI BILLION DOLLAR COMPANIES
 THAT WAITS YEARS TO GO PUBLIC.
 WHAT WE WANT IS COMPANIES EARLY
 IN THEIR LIFE CYCLE TO GIVE MORE
 OF THE AVERAGE INVESTORS ACCESS
 TO THEIR GROWTH AS THEY'RE
 YOUNGER COMPANIES AND NOT
 WAITING NECESSARILY UNTIL THEY
 BECOME GREAT 10 BILLION
 COMPANIES TO TAP THE MARKET.
 WE CONTINUE TO SEE IMPEDIMENTS
 FOR COMPANIES WANTING TO TAP THE
 MARKETS EARLY IN THEIR LIFE
 CYCLE.
 AFTER A DAY LIKE THIS, HOW IS
 YOUR CALL VOLUME GOING TO CHANGE
 TO EXACTLY THAT POINT, SIZES OF
 COMPANIES INTERESTED IN GOING
 PUBLIC
 WE ARE SEEING MORE AND MORE,
 PARTICULARLY IN THE ENTERPRISE
 SOFTWARE SPACE AND CLOUD SPACE
 THERE ARE A LOT OF GREAT
 COMPANIES OUT THERE THAT ARE IN
 OBVIOUSLY I WOULD SAY $1 BILLION
 TO $2 BILLION RANGE THAT ARE
 RECOGNIZING THE MARKET IS
 WIDE-OPEN FOR THEM
 IF THEY CAN DEMONSTRATE
 CONSISTENT GROWTH AND SHOW THE
 RESILIENCY OF THE BUSINESS MODEL
 IN TERMS OF STICKINESS TO THEIR
 CLIENTS AND SHOW SCALEABILITY
 LIKE ZOOM HAS DONE TO HAVE A
 PATH TO PROFITABILITY, I THINK
 THEY WILL FIND THEIR MARKET IS
 VERY RECEPTIVE.
 ZOOM WAS $1 BILLION TO $2
 BILLION A FEW MONTHS AGO
 PROBABLY SOME OF THOSE COMPANIES
 HAVE A PHOTO OF ERIC YUAN ON
 THEIR MIRROR NOW.
 THE ABILITY TO GROW IN SUCH A
 SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND GET TO
 PROFITABILITY IS WHAT
 DISTINGUISHED THEM
 ADENA FRIEDMAN, THANK YOU
 VERY MUCH.
 JOHN, DON'T GO TOO FAR
 DOW UP 100 POINTS, S&P BACK TO

 IT'S WORTH TAKING A MOMENT TO
 FRAME WHAT A MORNING WE'VE HAD
 TWO VERY SUCCESSFUL ISSUES AT
 LEAST AT THIS POINT BOTH HERE
 FOR BOTH EXCHANGES
 THE POLITICAL MEDIA CONTINUES TO
 DISSECT THE MUELLER REPORT AS
 HEADLINES ARE POPPING EVERY FEW
 SECONDS HERE
 AND THEN IF YOU THINK THAT'S NOT
 ENOUGH, NEXT WEEK THE EARNINGS
 ARE TRULY -- IT'S THE WEEK, IT'S
 MICROSOFT, COKE, CAT, BOEING,
 TWITTER, AMAZON, TESLA AND A LOT
 MORE.
 IT IS
 AND THERE'S QUITE A NUMBER OF
 EARNINGS THIS MORNING AND YOU
 CAN SEE THAT IN THE S&P AS WELL.
 IT'S LEADING EVERYTHING HIGHER
 THE INDUSTRIAL NAMES LIKE THAT
 ARE ALL BETTER THAN EXPECTED
 BUT QUITE THE HOUR
 WHAT IS THE TAKE FROM THE NASDAQ
 RIGHT NOW?
 MORGAN, THIS IS
