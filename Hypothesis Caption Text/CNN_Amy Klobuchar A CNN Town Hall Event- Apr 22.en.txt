 FIRST TIME, WOLF, WE'RE SEEING ON THE STAGE TIME BEFORE THE
 SAME AUDIENCE THE ABILITY TO
 COMPARE THESE CANDIDATES TO EACH
 OTHER.
 IT'S NOT A ONE OFF ????????? IS.
 THIS IS MAJOR MOMENT.
 FIVE KEY DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL
 CANDIDATES ABOUT TO THIS■■■
 STAGE.
 PHIL AND DAVID, THANK YOU VERY
 MUCH.
 I'M WOLF BLITZER IN WASHINGTON.
 THANKS FOR WATCHING.
 CNN'S PRESIDENTIAL TOWN HALLS
 LIVE FROM MANCHEST, NEW
 HAMPSHIRE, THEY START RIGHT NOWa
 GOOD EVE
 WELCOME TO A CNN SPECIAL
 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL TOWN
 HALL EVENT.
 I'M CHRIS CUOMO.
 WE ARE IN MANCHESTER, NUCHL.
 THIS IS THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL
 PRIMARY SFAT.
 NOW TONIGHT YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR
 FROM FIVE OF THE TOP DEMOCRATIC
 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ON THE
 SAME STAGE FOR THE FIRST TIME.
 YOU'VE GOT SENATORS AMY
 KAMALA HARRIS ANDORE D■>
 BUTTIGIEG.
 EACH GETS O HOUR BUT TONIGHT
 IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER TOWN
 HALLS.
 THE POTENTIAL QUESTIONERS■■
 ENTIRELY STUDENTS AND YOUNG
 ADULTS REPRESENTING MORE THAN 30
 STATES NATIONWIDE.
 NOW TO PULL THIS OFF CNN HAS
 PARTNERED WITH HARVARD
 UNIVERSITY'S INSTITUTE OF
 POLITICS WHICH JUST RELEASED ITS
 YOUTH POLL EXAMINING THE
 POLITICAL OPINIONS OF YOUNG
 AMERICANS.
 AND ALSO WE'RE WITH THE NEW
 HAMPSHIRE INSTITUTE OF POLITICS
 RIGHT HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.
 WHO HAS THE BEST PITCH FOR THAT
 ALL IMPORTANT YOUNG VOTE?
 TONIGHT YOU'RE GOING TO GET A
 GREAT LOOK AT THAT.
 FIRST OFF IN A RETURN TOWN HALL
 HERE IS SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR OF
 MINNESOTA, PITCHING HERSELF AS
 THE CANDIDATE WHO CAN DEFEAT
 PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IN THE
 MIDWEST.
 WELCOME, SENATOR.
 PLEASE, COME ON OUT.
 SENATOR, A PLEASURE.
 PLEASE.
 WOW, THANK YOU.
 IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU.
 LET'S GET RIGHT TO THE
 QUESTIONS.
 WE HAVE FALL OUT FROM THE
 MUELORT AS A TOPIC.
 OUR FIRST QUESTION IN OUR
 AUDIENCE IS JOHN, FRESHMAN AT
 HARVARD AT CAPETOWN,
 MASSACHUSETTS.
 SHOULD THE HOUSE JUDICIARY
 COMMITTEE MOVE FORWARD WITH
 IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS AGAINST
 PRESIDENT TRUMP?
 OKAY, SO I BELIEVE VERY
 STRONGLY THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP
 SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.
 WHEN YOU LOOK THROUGH THAT
 REPORT IT IS APPALLING SOME OF
 THE THINGS THAT WERE GOING ON.
 AND YOU CAN SEE TIME AND TIME
 AGAIN, MAYBE YOU'VE READ PARTS
 OF IT, THAT WAS HIS ADVISERS
 THAT HELD HIM BACK.
 SO I BELIEVE FIRST OF ALL WE
 NEED TO HAVE HEARINGS IN BOTH
 THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE AND NOT
 JUST WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR.
 WE NEED TO BRING DIRECTOR
 MUELLER BEFORE THE UNITED STATES
 SENATE, RIGHT?
 BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE ARE NEVER
 GOING TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF
 IT.
 THE IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS ARE
 UP TO THE HOUSE.
 THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE
 THAT DECISION.
 I AM IN THE SENATE, AND I
 BELIEVE THAT WE ARE THE JURY.
 I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED THIS FROM
 THE BEGINNING TO THE END.
 I'M A FORMER PROSECUTOR.
 I BELIEVE YOU LOOK AT THE
 EVIDENCE TO MAKE DECISIONS.
 SO IF THE HOUSE BRINGS THE
 IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS BEFORE
 US, WE WILL DEAL WITH THEM.
 BUT LET'S LOOK AT WHAT DIRECTOR
 MUELLER SAID.
 HE SAID THERE WERE TWO WAYS FOR
 ACCOUNTABILITY.
 ONE WAS DPCONGRESS, AND WE'RE
 GOING TO START SEEING THAT WITH
 THESE INVESTIGATIONS AND THE
 SECOND IS OTHER INVESTIGATIONS,
 RIGHT?
 THERE'S CASES GOING ON IN YOUR
 HOME STATE OF NEW YORK.
 THERE'S CASES GOING ON ALL OVER
 THE COUNTRY, BUT THERE IS A
 THIRD WAY TO HOLD THIS PRESIDENT
 ACCOUNTABLE AND THAT IS BY
 DEFEATING HIM IN THE 2020
 ELECTION.
 AND I BELIEVE I CAN DO THAT.
 SENATOR, JUST TO GIVE THEM A
 QUICK SENSE, DO YOU BELIEVE THAT
 ANYTHING YOU'VE READ AND
 PROCESSED IN THAT REPORT COULD
 HAVE THE WORD IMPEACHABLE
 ATTACHED TO IT?
 ANY -FIRST OF ALL, I
 BELIEVE I'M THE JURY HERE, SO
 I'M NOT GOING TO PREDISPOSE
 THINGS.
 I'M NOT GOING TO SAY WHETHER IT
 IS OR ISN'T.
 BUT I WILL SAY THERE ARE VERY
 DISTURBING THINGS THAT WOULD
 LEAD YOU TO BELIEVE THERE'S
 OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.
 I ASKED ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR
 THESE QUESTIONS.
 I SAID, WELL, IF THE PRESIDENT
 OR IF ANYONE WERE TO TRY TO
 CHANGE THE TESTIMONY OF A
 WITNESS WOULD YOU CONSIDER THAT
 OBSTRUCTION?
 I ASKED HIM A SERIES OF
 QUESTIONS AND I'M REALLY LOOKING
 FORWARD TO ASKING HIM THOSE
 AGAIN BECAUSE SEVERAL OF THEM HE
 ANSWERED YES AND SEVERAL OF THEM
 HE WOULDN'T SAY.
 AND A LOT OF THAT YOU SEE RIGHT
 IN THE MIDDLE OF THE REPORT.
 ALL RIGHT, NEXT QUESTION.
 ELIJAH DEVON, SOPHOMORE AT
 HARVARD FRUMP COMPTON,
 CALIFORNIA.
 HE INTERNED FOR SENATOR KAMALA
 HARRIS LAST SUMMER BUT HE'S NOT
 DECIDED WHICH CANDIDATE HE
 SUPPORTS YET.
 SENATOR, YOU'RE OFTEN
 CRITICIZED FOR HAVING BEEN A
 TOUGH ON CRIME PROSECUTOR WHO
 TOOK PART IN THE WAR ON DRUGS
 INCREASING YOUR COUNTY'S PRISON
 POPULATION.
 THESE PROSECUTIONS
 DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED
 PEOPLE OF COLOR.
 I PERSONALLY KNOW OF THESE
 PLIGHTS AS MY FATHER MISSED THE
 FIRST 13 YEARS OF HIS LIFE AS HE
 WAS INCARCERATED FOR A
 NONVIOLE DRUG RELATED OFFENSE.
 WHAT WOULD YOU DO AS PRESIDENT
 TO REMEDY THE TERRIBLE EFFECTS
 OF THESE POLICIES?
 I THINK AS YOU POINT OUT WHEN
 YOU'RE IN A JOB LIKE I HAD, YOU
 THINK ABOUT WHAT JUSTICE IS ALL
 ABOUT.
 AND I WOULD SAY ONE THING WE
 SHOULD NOTE DURING MY TIME IN
 THAT JOB WHERE I MANAGED THE
 BIGGEST PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE IN
 MY STATE WE ACTUALLY DID SEE
 AFRICAN-AMERICAN INCARCERATION,
 PRISON INCARCERATION GO DOWN BY

 AND A LOT OF THAT WAS THAT WE
 USED DRUG COURT AND WE TRIED TO
 FIND OTHER WAYS TO GET JUSTICE
 BECAUSE I ALWAYS LIKE TO SAY YOU
 DON'T LIKE TO SEE REPEAT
 CUSTOMERS WHEN YOU ARE IN THE
 DA'S OFFICE.
 AND ONE WAY YOU CAN ENSURE THAT
 YOU DON'T IS BY GETTING THEM
 TREATMENT.
 SO I HAVE BEEN A BIG BELIEVER IN
 DRUG COURTS AT THE STATE AND
 FEDERAL LEVELS.
 I'VE LED THAT EFFORT ON THE
 FEDERAL LEVEL.
 THE SECOND THING IS I THINK THAT
 OUR OFFICES, BOTH POLICE
 OFFICES, COUNTY ATTORNEY'S
 OFFICES NEED TO REFLECT THE
 POPULATION WE SERVE.
 AND I WORK VERY HARD TO BRING
 PEOPLE OF COLOR INTO OUR OFFICE,
 AND WE WERE A LOT BETTER FOR IT.
 AND A NUMBER OF THEM ROSE UP,
 BIG SURPRISE, AND BECAME JUDGES.
 THE OTHER THING IS THE WAY WE
 HANDLED CASES WHEN THEY COME IN.
 AND I WORKED WITH THE INNOCENCE
 PROJECT WHEN I WAS IN THE DA NOT
 ONLY TO REVIEW ALL OF OUR CASES
 BUT BRING IN A NEW TYPE OF
 EYEWITNESS I.D., SO INSTEAD OF
 LOOKING AT EACH ONE, ONE AT A
 TIME OR HAVING THEM ALL
 TOGETHER, YOU WOULD LOOK AT EACH
 PICTURE SO YOU'D HAVE TO MAKE AN
 EVALUATION.
 AND IT'S BEEN SHOWN TO DECREASE
 OUR RACISM IN THE SYSTEM AND
 DISCRIMINATORY DECISIONS BY
 WITNESSES.
 THE OTHER THING WE NEED TO DO IS
 NOT JUST PASS THE FIRST STEP
 ACT, AND I WAS PROUD TO BE A
 COSPONSOR OF THAT LEGISLATION
 WHICH WILL FINALLY REDUCE THE
 NONVIOLENT DRUG SENTENCES LIKE
 YOUR DAD HAD HAD WITH, BUT WOULD
 HELP US TO SAY THE REST OF THE
 COUNTRY, HEY, 90% OF THE PEOPLE
 INCARCERATED ARE INCARCERATED IN
 OUR STATE AND LOCAL JAILS.
 O DOING SOMETHING ON THE FEDERAL
 LEVEL IS GOOD, BUT WE HAVE TO
 CREATE INCENTIVES TO BRING THOSE
 SENTENCES DOWN AS WELL ON THE
 STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL.
 THERE IS RACISM IN OUR CRIMINAL
 JUSTICE SYSTEM.
 THERE HAS BEEN RACISM IN OUR
 CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM FOR A
 LONG TIME, AND WE MUST PLEDGE TO
 FIX IT.
 ONE LAST THING, I PUT OUT A PLAN
 FOR A CLEMENCY BOARD, SO WHEN
 I'M PRESIDENT, YES, I WANT TO
 HEAR FROM THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
 ON WHAT THEIR VIEWS ARE WHEN YOU
 LOOK AT PARDONS.
 BUT I ALSO WANT TO HEAR FROM A
 GROUP FROM THE OUTSIDE THAT'S
 GOING TO LOOK AT THESE CASES.
 BECAUSE WHEN YOU SEE SOME OF THE
 CASES LIKE A WOMAN THAT
 PRESIDENT OBAMA PARDONED NAMED
 J
 JOSEFINE SHE LITERALLY SERVED 24
 YEARS.
 SHE HADN'T SOLD THE DRUGS
 HERSELF, SHE DIDN'T DO THE
 DRUGS.
 SHE WAS A MIDDLE PERSON.
 WE DON'T WANT TO SEE MORE OUT
 THERE.
 WE WANT TO HAVE A JUSTICE SYSTEM
 THAT'S JUST.
 THAT TAKES US TO OUR NEXT
 QUESTION.
 MAX WINEBERG, STUDIED POLITICAL
 SCIENCE, HE'S FROM NEW YORK.
 HI, SENATOR.
 THERE ARE MANY CANDIDATES THAT
 SUPPORT FREE COLLEGE AND STUDENT
 LOAN FORGIVENESS.
 YOU HAVE STATED THAT YOU'RE NOT
 FOR EITHER OF THOSE.
 AS A CURRENT COLLEGE STUDENT
 ABOUT TO GRADUATE WITH A LOT OF
 DEBT, WHY SHOULD I VOTE FOR YOU?
 OKAY, BECAUSE I ACTUALLY WANT
 TO GET SOMETHING DONE WHEN IT
 COMES TO STUDENT LOANS.
 I'VE HAD MY OWN STUDENT LOANS
 WHEN I MET MY HUSBAND AND HE HAD
 TENS OF THOUSANDS OF STUDENT
 LOANS.
 GOOD NEWS FOR YOU GUYS, I
 MARRIED HIM ANYWAY.
 AND I HAVE SEEN THE IMPACT OF
 STUDENT LOANS.
 SO HERE'S MY IDEA.
 LET ME PUT IT OUT THERE.
 FIRST OF ALL, YOU HAVE GOT
 $1.5 TRILLION OF STUDENT DEBT
 RIGHT NOW IN THIS COUNTRY, A LOT
 OF HOME MORTGAGE DEBT, A LOT OF
 CREDIT CARD DEBT.
 OUR GOVERNMENT ALSO HAS A LOT OF
 DEBT.
 SO THE FIRST THING I WOULD DO IS
 ALLOW STUDENTS AND NO MATTER HOW
 OLD THEY ARE, FORMER STUN TO
 REFINANCE THEIR STUDENT LOANS AT
 THAT RATE THAT'S A LITTLE ABOVE
 3%, WE COULD EVEN GO LOWER TO
 FIND SOME EVEN BETTER RATE THAN
 THAT.
 BUT THAT'S WHAT I THINK WE NEED
 TO DO TO BRING THE INTEREST RATE
 PAYMENTS DOWN FOR THOSE
 AMERICANS THAT STILL HAVE THE
 STUDENT LOANS.
 THE SECOND THING I WOULD DO IS
 EXPAND PROGRAMS AND MAKE IT
 EASIER FOR PEOPLE DEPENDING ON
 YOUR INCOME LEVEL TO MAKE THAT
 EASIER AS WELL AS THE AMOUNT OF
 MONEY YOU GET.
 THE THIRD THING I DO IS BRING
 BACK PRESIDENT OBAMA'S PLAN FOR
 FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE.
 THOSE ARE TWO YEAR DEGREES, AND
 THAT GETS A LOT OF STUDENTS A
 GOOD START.
 MY OWN SISTER DIDN'T GRADUATE
 FROM HIGH SCHOOL.
 SHE HAD A HARD TIME THEN, AND
 SHE WENT AND WORKED IN
 MANUFACTURING AND THEN SHE LATER
 WENT AND GOT HER GED, AND THEN
 AFTER THAT SHE WENT TO COMMUNITY
 COLLEGE AND SHE GOT HER DEGREE
 THERE.
 IT TOOK YEARS, AND AFTER THAT
 SHE FINISHED HER FOUR YEAR
 DEGREE AND IS NOW GAINFULLY
 EMPLOYED.
 THERE ARE A LOT OF PATHS TO
 SUCCESS IN AMERICA, BUT WE CAN
 ALL AGREE THAT WE WANT TO MAKE
 CLE
 COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE.
 WE LOOK AT ALSO THERE'S LOAN
 FORGIVENESS.
 I HOPE YOU FOLLOW A LOT OF
 PEOPLE THAT GO ON THIS PATH
 OF --
 LIKE SENATOR WARREN.
 -PUBLIC SERVICE.
 RIGHT.
 I THINK WE CAN ALSO EXPAND THAT
 INTO IN DEMAND JOBS.
 SO IT LOOK LIKE YOU HAVE A
 FOLLOW-UP, CHRIS.
 I WAS LISTENING AND THIS IS
 THE AUDIENCE TO HAVE THIS
 CONVERSATION WITH.
 SO MANY OF THESE KIDS YOU'RE
 GOING TO SEE SIX FIGURES IN DEBT
 BEFORE SIX FIGURES IN SALARY.
 SENATOR WARREN SAYS WE'LL
 FORGIVE THE DEBT.
 WE'LL FORGIVE UP TO $50,000.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK OF LOAN
 FORGIVENESS AND PLANS THAT ARE
 MORE GENEROUS ON THE OUTSIDE
 THAN YOUR OWN?
 WELL, I WOULD TARGET THE LOAN
 FORGIVENESS AT THOSE THAT, FOR
 INSTANCE -I PROTUPBROUGHT UP
 THAT WENT INTO PUBLIC SERVICE,
 IN DEMAND JOBS WE HAVE IN OUR
 ECONOMY.■■■■SH I COULD STAPLE■■E
 COLLEGE DIPLOMA UNDER EVERY ONE
 OF YOUR CHAIRS.
 I DON'T.
 DON'T LOOK.
 IT'S NOT THERE.
 I WISH I COULD DO THAT BUT I
 HAVE TO BE STRAIGHT WITH YOU AND
 TELL YOU THE TRUTH AND THAT IS
 YOUR GENERATION IS AN INCREDIBLE
 GENERATION.
 THEY SAY KIDS YOUR AGE LIVE IN
 THEIR PARENTS BASEMENT MORE THAN
 ANY OTHER GENERATION.
 IS THAT YOUR CHOICE?
 NO.
 IT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE SADDLED YOU
 WITH A BUNCH OF DEBT, WITH JOBS
 THAT OFTEN DON'T HAVE BENEFITS
 WITH THEM, ALL RIGHT?
 THEY SAY CRAZY THINGS ABOUT YOUR
 GENERATION.
 SOME OF MY FAVORITE ONES ARE
 THAT YOU HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO
 GETTING RID OF PAPER NAPKINS.
 OKAY, THAT'S SMART BECAUSE YOU
 CHOSE TO USE PAPER TOWELS, ALL
 RIGHT?
 OR THEY HAVE SAID THAT YOUR
 GENERATION IS GID OF
 DIAMOND RINGS.
 WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE YOU HAVE
 TOO MUCH STUDENT DEBT, ALL
 RIGHT?
 AND SO YOU GO THROUGH ALL THESE
 THINGS AND WHAT I SEE IN YOUR
 GENERATION IS THE LEAST RACIST
 GENERATION WE'VE EVER HAD IN
 THIS COUNTRY.
 IT IS THE MOST DIVERSE
 GENERATION WE'VE EVER HAD IN
 THIS COUNTRY.
 IT IS A GENERATION THAT CARES
 MO ABOUT THE WORLD AROUND THEM
 THAN WE EVER HAVE HAD IN THIS
 COUNTRY.
 SO YOU DESERVE MORE THAN TO BE
 SADDLED WITH MORE AND MORE DEBT,
 ALL RIGHT?
 SO EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE
 PROPOSED TO YOU, I HAVE FOUND
 WAYS TO PAY FOR IT THAT I THINK
 MAKES SENSE THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY
 GET DONE.
 WE CAN REPEAL REGRESSIVE
 PORTIONS OF OF THAT TRUMP TAX
 CUT WHERE SO MUCH OF THE MONEY
 WENT TO THE TOP.
 WE CAN CHANGE THE WAY WE HANDLED
 SOMETHING CALLED THE CARRIED
 INTEREST LOOPHOLE WHERE HEDGE
 FUND MANAGERS GET TO HAVE THEIR
 TAXES AT LESS OF A RATE THAN
 ANYONE ELSE.
 WE CAN CHANGE THE WAY WE DO
 CAPITAL GAINS TAX WHICH IS
 ANOTHER WAY WE COULD LITERALLY
 BRING IN HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF
 DOLLARS.
 THOSE ARE WAYS WE CAN PAY TO
 MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE CAN
 AFFORD COLLEGE.
 BECAUSE ONE SIZE DOESN'T FIT ■W.
 JENNIFER'S A SOPHOMORE AT THE
 UNIVERSITY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE
 STUDYING POLITICAL SCIENCE AND
 HISTORY, HAS A QUESTION ABOUT
 THE WAGE GAP.
 HI, SENATOR.
 A MAN WHO IS EQUALLY OR LESSER
 QUALIFIED THAN I AM WILL
 AUTOMATICALLY MAKE MORE MONEY
 THAN ME.
 SO MY QUESTION IS WHAT WILL YOU
 DO TO CLOSE THE WAGE GAP?
 PASS THE EQUAL PAY ACT, THAT
 WOULD BE ONE THING.
 WE'VE ALREADY PASSED THE ACT
 THAT WE WERE PROUD OF THAT MADE
 IT EASIER FOR WOMEN TO CONTEST
 THESE KINDS OF CASES WHEN
 THEY'RE IN THE WORKPLACE.
 I THINK ALSO MAKING IT EASIER
 FOR WOMEN TO GET THE KIND OF
 JOBS THEY SHOULD.
 I WOULD LOVE TO PASS THE ERA,
 RIGHT, GET THAT CEMENTED INTO
 LAW ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
 AND THEN MAKE SURE WE HAVE ROLE
 MODELS ACROSS IT COUNTRY.
 BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT MOVIE,
 HIDDIAN FIGURES I LOVE THAT
 MOVIE.
 BUT WOMEN LEADERS,
 AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN
 ESPECIALLY SHOULDN'T BE HIDDEN
 FIGURES ANYMORE.
 THEY SHOULD BE REAL LEADERS IN
 THE BOARDROOM, LEADERS IN THE
 U.S. SENATE LIKE WE'RE ALREADY
 STARTING TO SEE AND THEY SHOULD
 BE LEADERS IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
 AND WHEN YOU HAVE A WOMAN
 PRESIDENT, I HAVE A FUNNY
 FEELING WE'RE FINALLY GOING TO
 GET CHILD CARE POLICY DONE IN
 THIS COUNTRY, RIGHT?
 WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THE KIND OF
 CHANGES WE WANT TO SEE TO MAKE
 IT EASIER FOR WORKING FAMILIES
 AND FOR EVERYONE TO ACHIEVE
 THINGS.
 BECAUSE OTHERWISE OUR ECONOMY IS
 GOING TO BE STAGNANT IF EVERYONE
 CAN'T HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE.
 BECAUSE THE OLD JOKE WE USED TO
 SAY FOR WOMEN CANDIDATES IS IF
 YOU'RE NOT AT THE TABLE, YOU'RE
 ON THE MENU.
 SO THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPEN.
 ALL RIGHT, AND ONE OF THE
 THINGS THAT APPLIES MOST EVENLY
 ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND NO MATTER
 WHAT YOU MAKE, HEALTH CARE.
 GRAHAM MACKLAND, ST. STUDYING
 ECONOMICS, HE'S FROM
 MASSACHUSETTS.
 WHAT'S YOUR QUESTION?
 THANK YOU, SENATOR.
 IN A PERFECT WORLD WHICH
 COUNTRY'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM
 WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THE U.S.'
 MOST CLOSELY RESEMBLE AND WHAT
 SPECIFIC POLICIES DO YOU HOPE TO
 TAKE IN THAT DIRECTION?
 OKAY, WELL I'M NOT GOING TO
 PICK A PARTICULAR COUNTRY JUST
 BECAUSE I THINK OUR COUNTRY CAN
 BE THE BEST IF WE MAKE SOME
 CHANGES.
 BUT THERE SHOULD BE SOME MODELS
 WE COMBINE TO MAKE OUR SYSTEM
 BETTER.
 LET ME TALK AT WE NEED
 TO DO IN AMERICA AS OPPOSED TO
 SOME OTHER COUNTRY THAT MIGHT
 NOT FIT OUR SITUATION.
 I THINK FIRST OF ALL WE NEED TO
 BRING DOWN PREMIUMS.
 I NOTE ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE
 ACT SIDE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE, IT'S
 HAD A MAJOR IMPACT.
 ONE, YOU CAN KEEP ON YOUR
 PARENTS INSURANCE UNTIL YOU'RE
 26, RIGHT?
 TWO, WE'VE SEEN HALF OF THE
 YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE UNINSURED,
 THEY'VE BECOME INSURED BECAUSE
 OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT,
 WHICH IS A BIG DEAL.
 AND THREE, ONE OUT OF SIX OF YOU
 ACTUALLY HAVE PRE-EXISTING
 CONDITIONS.
 SO IF WE GET RID OF THE
 AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, WHICH IS
 WHAT THIS PRESIDENT IS TRYING TO
 DO, ALL OF THOSE BENEFITS WILL
 GO AWAY.
 SO MY FIRST FOCUS IS MAKING SURE
 WE KEEP THAT IN PLACE BUT WE
 IMPROVE IT BY BRINGING PREMIUMS
 DOWN.
 YOU CAN DO THAT MANY WAYS.
 ONE OF MY MAJOR PROPOSALS IS TO
 BRING BACK THE PUBLIC OPTIONS
 IDEA THAT'S BEEN FLOATING AROUND
 THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PUT IN THE
 FIRST PLACE.
 YOU CAN DO IT WITH MEDICAID OR
 MEDICARE SO YOU HAVE A LESS
 EXPENSIVE OPTION TO PICK FROM.
 THE OTHER THING I WOULD DO IS TO
 BRING DOWN THE COST OF
 PHARMACEUTICALS.
 EVERYONE IN THIS AUDITORIUM HERE
 KNOWS SOMEONE THAT'S BEEN HURT
 BY THE HIGH COSTS OF
 PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.
 MY OWN DAUGHTER HAS ALLERGIES
 AND SHE CARRIES AN EPIPEN
 EVERYWHERE SHE WENT.
 SO WHEN I SAW THAT COST DRUBL,
 TRIPLE LIKE WE SAW A FEW YEARS
 BACK I TOOK IT ON.
 I TOOK IT ON SOCIAL MEDIA, THE
 STATE FAIR BOOTH AND TV, AND WE
 WON THAT FIGHT.
 BUT NOT EVERY FAMILY IS GOING TO
 BE ABLE TO TAKE ON EVERY SINGLE
 PRICE INCREASE.
 WE NEED COMPETITION BY HAVING
 NEGOTIATION FOR MEDICARE PRICE,
 YOU MIGHT THINK IT DOESN'T
 AFFECT ME BECAUSE I'M NOT ON
 MEDICARE.
 GUESS WHAT?
 THAT'LL BRING DOWN THE PRICES
 FOR EVERYONE.
 WE SHOULD BRING IN LESS
 EXPENSIVE DRUGS FROM OTHER
 COUNTRIES LIKE CANADA.
 WE CAN PRACTICALLY SEE CANADA
 FROM OUR PORTS WHEN WE'RE UP
 HERE, RIGHT, AND THEY HAVE LESS
 EXPENSIVE DRUG PRICES THAN WE
 HAVE IN AMERICA.
 WE CAN STOP THIS HORRIBLE
 PRACTICE WHERE BIG
 PHARMACEUTICALS PAY OFF, THEY
 LITERALLY PAY OFF GENERICS TO
 KEEP THE PRICES AND COMPETITION
 OFF THE MARKET.
 THAT'S BAD, AND WE CAN FICK
 THIS.
 THIS IS ONE OF THE
 DISTINGUISHING ISSUES TONIGHT TO
 DISCUSS ESPECIALLY WITH YOU,
 SENATOR.
 BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ONLY SENATOR
 TONIGHT WHO IS NOT COSPONSORING
 THE NEW MEDICARE FOR ALL BILL.
 AND I WANTED TO PUT THAT IN THE
 CONTEXT OF SOMETHING WE LEARNED
 FROM OUR PARTNERSHIP.
 THE YOUTH POLL SAYS THAT THE
 MAJORITY OF LIKELY YOUNG VOTERS
 ARE FOR IT.
 SO THIS AUDIENCE, 52% OF THE
 LIKELY VOTERS HERE FOR MEDICARE
 FOR ALL.
 YOU'RE NOT.
 WHAT'S YOUR SELL?
 OKAY, LET ME GO.
 SO I WANT TO BRING DOWN YOUR
 HEALTH CARE COSTS.
 I THINK I'VE EXPLAINED THAT, AND
 I THINK YOU'VE GOT TO BELIEVE ME
 ON THIS.
 I HAVE BEEN OUT FRONT TAKING ON
 THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES AND
 WAS OUT FRONT AS AN ADVOCATE FOR
 THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT FROM THE
 VERY BEGINNING.
 BUT I WANT TO GET TO UNIVERSAL
 HEALTH CARE AND I MEANT TO GET
 THEIR FAST.
 AND ONE OF THE WAYS WE DO THAT
 IS FIRST OF ALL WE CAN
 IMMEDIATELY DO SOMETHING TO
 BRING DOWN THOSE PREMIUM PRICES
 WITH SOMETHING I'M NOT GOING TO

 GO INTO BUT IT'S COST SHARING AS
 WELL AS RESHOOURS.
 BUT THEN THE NEXT BIG THING IS
 GET THAT PUBLIC OPTION IN PLACE.
 THEN YOU DON'T HAVE MIDDLE MEN.
 YOU HAVE COMPETITION, YOU HAVE
 PEOPLE THAT WILL GO EVER THERE
 AND I BELIEVE ONCE YOU HAVE THAT
 SETUP IN THE RIGHT WAY WHICH IS
 WHY THE INSURANCE COMPANIES WERE
 FIGHTING AGAINST IT, AND THAT IS
 THE WAY YOU GET THERE WITHOUT
 SUDDENLY DISMANTLE THE ENTIRE
 SYSTEM WHICH WAS VERY DIFFICULT
 TO DO WHEN WE PUT THE AFFORDABLE
 CARE ACT IN PLACE.
 YOU GUYS WERE PRETTY YOUNG, IT
 WAS A FEW YEARS AGO BUT IT WAS A
 HARD THING TO DO.
 AND WHAT I WANT TO DO IS WHAT DO
 THE DOCTORS SAY?
 DO NO HARM.
 AND I THINK WE DO NO HARM AND DO
 US MUCH BETTER BY GETTING THAT
 PUBLIC OPTION IN PLACE.
 AND NO ONE HAS TAKEN ON
 PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES.
 YOU ALL KNOW SOMEONE THAT HAS
 DIABETES, SOMEONE STRUGGLING
 WITH THAT COST OF INSULIN.
 WE HAD A GUY IN MY STATE WHO'S A
 RESTAURANT MANAGER WHO'S 26
 YEARS OLD WHO WAS ON HIS MOM'S
 HEALTH INSURANCE.
 AND THEN WHEN HE HAD TO GET OFF
 IT, HE COULDN'T AFFORD IT, HE
 STARTED RATIONING AND HE DIED.
 THAT HAPPENED IN OUR COUNTRY.
 SO IF WE KEEP PUTTING IN
 PRESIDENTS LIKE THIS ONE WHO
 BASICALLY HAS SAID HE WANTS TO
 DO SOMETHING ABOUT PHARMA AND
 THEN HE PUTS HIS PLAN OUT AND
 THE STOCK GOES UP, THAT ACTUALLY
 HAPPENED, OKAY.
 WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS PUT
 SOMEONE IN WHO HAS■7■7 TRACK
 RECORD OF TAKING ON PHARMA WHO'S
 WILLING TO GET IT DONE AND
 ACTUALLY HAS A TRACK RECORD OF
 PASSING BILLS AND WORKING ACROSS
 THE AISLE ESPECIALLY ON
 PHARMACEUTICALS TO GET IT DONE.
 I'M THAT PERSON.
 WELL, THAT'S A GOOD SEGWAY
 BECAUSE THE POLICY IDEAS ARE
 ONLY AS GOOD AS YOUR IDEAS TO
 PUT THEM INTO PRACTICE.
 ADEN PIERCE STUDYING
 INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS FROM
 MASSACHUSETTS.
 HE'S GOT A QUESTION ABOUT HOW
 YOU WIN WITH A SPECIFIC GROUP.
 THANK YOU, SENATOR, FOR
 TAKING MY QUESTION.
 DONALD TRUMP WON THE 2016
 ELECTION IN LARGE PART BECAUSE
 HE APPEALED TO A DISCONTENT
 MIDDLE CLASS IN THE HEARTLAND.
 HOW DO YOU WIN BACK THEIR TRUST
 AND THEIR VOTE?
 I GUESS YOU LOOK AT WHAT I'VE
 DONE, AND I AM SOMEONE THAT RUNS
 IN A PURPLE STATE.
 IT IS A STATE WHEN I FIRST
 STARTED RUNNING FOR OFFICE THE
 OTHER SENATOR WAS REPUBLICAN,
 THE GOVERNOR WAS REPUBLICAN AND
 THREE OUR FOUR OF OUR OFFICES
 WAS REPUBLICAN.
 AND I STARTED RUNNING.
 AND EVERY SINGLE TIME I HAVE WON
 I HAVE WON EVERY SINGLE
 CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT IN MY
 STATE.
 IT'S WHEN YOU GUYS ARE SUPPOSED
 TO CHEER, OKAY?
 AND I DIDN'T DO THAT BY SELLING
 OUT ON MY PRINCIPLES.
 I DID THAT BY GOING NOT JUST
 WHERE IT'S COMFORTABLE BUT WHERE
 IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE.
 I DID THAT BY MEETING PEOPLE
 WHERE THEY WERE.
 BY GOING TO FARMS, GOING TO
 SMALL TOWN CAVES, BY WINNING THE
 RIGHT WAY.
 AND THEY DIDN'T AGREE WITH
 EVERYTHING I'VE SAID AND THEY
 STILL DON'T, BUT THEY TRUSTED
 ME.
 THEY TRUSTED ME WITH THEIR
 MONEY, THEIR IDEAS AND THEY
 TRUSTED I WAS GOING TO GO TO
 WASHINGTON TO HAVE THEIR BACK.
 AND I THINK WE NEED THAT KIND OF
 MESSAGE, WE NEED THAT KIND OF
 MESSENGER IF WE'RE GOING TO WIN
 THIS.
 AND JUST LAST ELECTION IN 2018
 DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO WIN OUR
 STATE.
 I CAME BACK TWO YEARS LATER AND
 WON 40 OF THE RURAL COUNTIES
 THAT HE WON.
 I THINK THAT IT IS NOT JUST THE
 MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY, IT'S
 REALLY THE ENTIRE MIDDLE CLASS
 ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT WE HAVE
 TO HAVE POLICIES AND IDEAS AND
 BREAD AND BUTTER IDEAS THAT SHOW
 WE HAVE THEIR BACK.
 AND IT DOESN'T MATTER THE COLOR
 OF ANYONE'S SKIN.
 IF WE NEED TO SHOW WE HAVE THEIR
 BACK.
 AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT MESSAGE
 GOT LOST BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP
 LIKES TO DIVERT YOU EVERY SINGLE
 DAY.
 YOU KNOW WHAT HE DOES.
 HE SENDS OUT A TWEET TO TRY TO
 CONTROL THE MESSAGE.
 WHEN HE DID THAT TO ME AND I
 ANNOUNCED MY CANDIDACY IN THE
 MIDDLE OF A BLIZZARD AND HE MADE
 FUN OF ME FOR TALKING ABOUT
 CLIMATE CHANGE -BY THE WAY,
 HAPPY EARTH DAY.
 WHEN HE MADE FUN OF ME FOR DOING
 THAT, I SAID, HEY, DONALD TRUMP,
 THE SCIENCE IT ON MY SIDE.
 AND I'D LIKE TO SEE HOW YOUR
 HAIR WOULD FAIR IN A BLIZZARD.
 SO THE POINT HERE IS THAT, YES,
 WHAT HAPPENED IN 2016 WE HAD A
 GREAT CANDIDATE WITH GREAT
 POLICIES.
 WE HAD RUSSIA COMING IN AND
 INVADING OUR ELECTION.
 AND BY THE WAY, I DON'T CARE IF
 THEY DID IT WITH TANKS OR
 MISSILES AND THIS TIME THEY DID
 IT TO OUR ELECTION.
 WE HAD NEVER RUN AGAINST ANYONE
 LIKE DONALD TRUMP.
 WELL, WE LEARNED HOW TO DO THAT
 IN 2018.
 AND SOMETIMES, YES, STANDING
 YOUR GROUND IN YOUR VALUES,
 SOMETIMES IGNORING HIM AND
 SOMETIMES USING A LITTLE HUMOR.
 BECAUSE A LOT OF THE THINGS HE
 SAYS ARE JUST COMPLETELY ABSURD,
 AND WE NEED TO TAKE IT TO THE
 PEOPLE IN MINNESOTA AND
 WISCONSIN AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY
 AND THAT'S HOW WE WIN THIS
 ELECTION.
 LET'S TAKE A QUICK BREAK.
 WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH CNN'S

 ALL RIGHT, WELCOME BACK TO CNN'S SPECIAL DEMOCRATIC
 PRESIDENTIAL TOWN HALL, AND
 THAT'S WITH MINNESOTA SENATOR
 AMY KLOBUCHAR, THE FIRST OF FIVE
 PRESIDENTIAL TOWN HALLS TONIGHT.
 WE ARE JUST GETTING STARTED.
 WHAT A RANGE OF GREAT QUESTIONS
 IN THAT FIRST UND.
 I  WE'LL MATCH IT BETTER
 THIS TIME.
 START WITH THOMAS.
 A SOPHOMORE FROM HARVARD AT
 RHODE ISLAND.
 YOUR QUESTION IS ABOUT FROZEN
 PIZZA.
 IT IS.
 HI, SENATOR.
 IN 2010 YOU PETITIONED THE UDA
 TO KEEP FROZEN PIZZAS IN
 LUNCHES.
 AMID THE OBESITY EPIDEMIC THAT
 HAS PLAGUED THIS COUNTRY FOR
 DECADES TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU
 BELIEVE THE FINANCIAL CORPORATE
 INTERESTS IN THIS STATE SHOULD
 OUTWEIGH?
 FIRST OF ALL, I MADE CLEAR IN
 "THE NEW YORK TIMES" ARTICLE A
 FEW YEARS LATER WHEN I ASKED
 ABOUT THAT IS IT WAS JUST A
 LETTER I HAD SENT.
 WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
 DOWNTURN, AND IT WAS A LITTLE
 MORE I WOULD SAY COMPLEX IN
 TERMS OF THE LANGUAGE, BUT IT'S
 A FAIR CRITICISM.
 AND SO I SAID I REGRETTED
 SENDING THAT LETTER.
 IT WAS ABOUT TRYING TO KEEP A
 COMPANY AFLOAT IN A REALLY SMALL
 TOWN THAT EMPLOYED A BUNCH OF
 PEOPLE.
 PUT I THINK THAT NUTRITION IS
 PARAMOUNT TO THIS COUNTRY, AND
 THAT'S WHY WAY BEFORE I WAS
 RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT I SAID
 THAT WAS A MISTAKE, ALL RIGHT?
 SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BIGGER
 ISSUE WHICH IS NUTRITION, AND
 THAT IS THAT WE NEED TO HAVE
 HEALTHIER FOODS IN KIDS'
 LUNCHES.
 WE NEED TO HAVE HEALTHIER FOODS
 AVAILABLE NO MATTER HOW MUCH
 THEY ARE.
 AND AS R I HAVE BEEN A MAJOR
 ADVOCATE FOR BETTER SCHOOL
 LUNCH, MORE NUTRITIOUS SCHOOL
 LUNCHES.
 I ALSO HAD A BILL FOR PRESCHOOL
 SCHOOL LUNCHES TO MAKE SURE
 THOSE ARE NUTRITIOUS AS WELL.
 WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN THE
 CONTEXT -THIS WOULD BE
 UNPOPULAR WITH THIS CROWD.
 THIS IS ABOUT HOW IT WAS
 COUNTED.
 NO, I DIDN'T THINK THAT FROZEN
 PIZZA WITH TOMATO SAUCE ON IT, I
 DO NOT BELIEVE SHOULD BE COUNTED
 AS A VEGETABLE.
 BUT SHOULD IT BE IN LUNCHES?
 I THINK THAT IS SOMETIMES IN
 LUNCHES.
 BUT SHOULD IT BE?
LONG AS YE OTHER
 THINGS WITH IT, RIGHT?
 AS LONG AS YOU HAVE REAL
 VEGETABLES WITH IT, AND AS LONG
 AS YOU HAVE OTHER THINGS WITH
 IT.
 AND I'M LOOKING AT MY DAUGHTER
 RIGHT NOW -BY THE WAY, SHE IS
 HERE.
 SHE IS 23 AND PLEASE BE NICE TO
 HER BECAUSE HOW WOULD YOU FEEL
 IF IT WAS YOUR MOM UP HERE BEING
 ASKED ABOUT PIZZA.
 CALLING HER OUT IN FRONT OF
 EVERYBODY.
 THERE SHE IS.
 EXACTLY, EXACTLY.
 SHE WENT TO A SCHOOL ACTUALLY
 THAT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN
 YOUR SCHOOL.
 AND HER SCHOOL WAS I THINK IN
 HIGH SCHOOL IT WAS IN MIDDLE
 WHERE SOMETHING LIKE 90% FREE
 AND REDUCED LUNCH, MAYBE EVEN A
 LITTLE HIGHER THAN THAT.
 AND THAT WAS A SCHOOL IN
 MINNEAPOLIS SHE WENT FOR SEVERAL
 YEARS AND I GET TO BE IN THE
 LUNCHROOM AND SAW WHAT IT WAS
 LIKE FOR THESE KIDS THAT
 COULDN'T AFFORD LUNCH.
 I THINK EVERYONE IN HER CLASS AT
 ONE POINT WAS AN IMMIGRANT
 EXCEPT HER.
 AND THERE WERE KIDS IN THE
 LUNCHROOMS THAT WERE TREEING TO
 GET STUFF BUT THEY WOULD GET A
 DOUGHNUT AND EAT THAT INSTEAD.
 A LOT OF THE KIDS WERE GETTING
 STUFF OUT OF THE VENDING
 MACHINES TO BRING HOME AND EAT
 FOR DINNER.
 I KNOW BECAUSE MY DAUGHTER ONLY
 WENT TO PUBLIC SCHOOL AND FOR A
 NUMBER OF YEARS SHE WENT TO
 PUBLIC SCHOOLS WHERE THE VAST
 MAJORITY WERE FREE AND REDUCED
 LUNCH.
 YOU ASKED ME WHERE THIS COMES
 FROM AND WHY I BROUGHT IT UP
 BECAUSE I'VE LIVED IT.
 OUR NEXT QUESTION IS FROM
 ADRIANA FERNANDES, A SOPHOMORE
 AND ORIGINALLY FROM NICARAGUA.
 MY QUESTION IS OUR CURRENT
 SECRETARY OF EDUCATION IS
 ATTEMPTING TO SLASH FUNDING FROM
 SPECIAL NEEDS PROGRAMS.
 WHAT ARE YOUR IDEAS REGARDING
 THE FEDERAL RESPONSIBILITY TO
 THE EDUCATION SYSTEM?
 THANK YOU SO MUCH, AND LET'S
 MENTION THE NAME OF THAT
 EDUCATION SECRETARY IS BETSEY
 DeVOS, OKAY?
 SOMEONE THAT I STRONGLY OPPOSED
 AND I JUST THINK SHOULDN'T BE IN
 HER JOB.
 AND SO IT IS NO■■■ SURPRISE TO
 ME -IT IS NO SURPRISE TO ME
 THESE THINGS KEEP HAPPENING, AND
 SHE NOT ONLY HAS TRIED TO DEFUND
 SPECIAL EDUCATION, BUT SHE ALSO
 HAS TRIED TO GET RID OF THE
 SPECIAL OLYMPICS FUNDING, IF YOU
 WATCHED ANY OF THIS.
 AND I THINK WE NOTED THAT
 LITERALLY JUST A FEW TRIPS BACK
 TO MAR-A-LAGO AND BACK WITH THE
 PRESIDENT COULD HAVE FUNTHE
 SPECIAL OLYMPICS FUNDING.
 THAT IS TRUE STATISTIC.
 SO I THINK OUR JOB IN GOVERNMENT
 IS TO REPRESENT EVERYONE, AND IT
 IS PARTICULAR TO REPRESENT
 PEOPLE THAT MAYBE CAN'T WRITE A
 CHECK THEMSELVES, RIGHT?
 OR MAYBE CAN'T EVEN WRITE
 THEMSELVES OR MAYBE NEED HELP?
 MAYBE THEY'RE IN A WHEELCHAIR.
 MAYBE THEY HAVE PHYSICAL
 DISABILITIES, MAYBE MENTAL
 DISABILITIES, BUT OUR JOB IS TO
 STANDBY THEM.
 I REMEMBER BEING IN A SMALL TOWN
 PARADE IN MINNESOTA A FEW YEARS
 AGO AND A MOM WAS PUSHING A BABY
 CARRIAGE AND SHE POINTED AT A
 DAWDLER AND SHE SAID THIS IS MY
 BOY, HE'S ONLY 3 YEARS OLD AND
 HAS DOWN STREAM.
 THIS IS WHAT A PRE-EXISTING
 CONDITION LOOKS LIKE.
 AND THAT WAS THE MOMENT I SAID
 TO MYSELF FINALLY PEOPLE KNOW
 WHAT IT MEANS.
 IT MEANS THINGS LIKE
 DISABILITIES.
 IT MEANS THINGS LIKE IF YOU'RE A
 VICTIM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.
 IF MEANS THINGS LIKE IF YOU HAVE
 DIABETES OR YOU HAVE CANCER OR
 YOUR MOM HAS A CERTAIN DISEASE.
 SO WE NOT ONLY NEED TO STAND UP
 WHEN IT COMES TO DISABILITY
 FUNDING INCLUDING EDUCATION
 FUNDING WITH IDEA, BUT IT IS THE
 FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PUTTING
 MANDATES ON THE STATE AND THEN
 NOT PUTTING THE MONEY WITH IT.
 BUT WE ALSO NEED TO STAND UP
 WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTH CARE FOR
 PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES.
 AND WHEN YOU CHECK THESE THINGS
 OFF WITH WHAT THIS
 ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE, THEY
 WANT TO GET RID OF THE
 AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND THOSE
 PROTECTIONS.
 THAT HURTS THE DISABILITY
 COMMUNITY.
 THEY WANT TO REDUCE THE FUNDING
 FOR SPECIAL ED AND FOR THE
 OLYMPICS WHICH THEN HAD A
 REVERSE ON BECAUSE THERE WAS
 SUCH A PUBLIC OUTCRY.
 THAT HURTS PEOPLE WITH
 DISABILITIES, AND THEY HAVEN'T
 DONE ANYTHING TO FUND EDUCATION
 FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES.
 SO I GIVE THEM SINCE YOU'RE ALL
 STUDENTS, AN "F."
 ON THAT ISSUE OF CLIMATE I
 WANT TO BRING IN MADELEINE
 WOODS, A SENIOR AT HARVARD.
 HELLO, MADELEINE AND
 CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT.
 THANK YOU.
 I DON'T HAVE MUCH CHOICE IN IT
 BUT IT WAS A GREAT CHILDHOOD.
 SPEAKING OF THE CLIMATE, YOU
 BACKED ALEXANDRIA
 OCASIO-CORTEZ'S GREEN NEW DEAL.
 WHILE I WAS RAISED IN A WOLF
 SANCTUARY I COME FROM A RURAL
 ISOLATED TOWN WHERE PEOPLE
 CRITICIZED THE GREEN NEW DEAL
 AND FOUND IT LAUGHABLE THAT THEY
 WERE BEING TOLD HOW TO CARE FOR
 THEIR ENVIRONMENT BY PEOPLE FROM
 LARGE CITIES.
 SO I KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT OF
 RURAL VOTERS.
 HOW DO YOU PLAN TO IMPROVE RURAL
 KMUNLTS AND THE DISCUSSION ON
 CLIMATE CHANGE?
 THAT IS REALLY A GREAT
 QUESTION, THANKS.
 SO IT'S EARTH DAY AND FOR TOO
 LONG WE HAVE BEEN DEBATING
 WHETHER CLIMATE CHANGE IS
 HAPPENING.
 MY FAVORITE MOMENT OF THIS WHEN
 JOHN OLIVER FINALLY DECIDED TO
 PUT 100 SCIENTISTS ON HIS STAGE
 IN WHITE COATS.
 99 OF THEM WERE ON ONE ONE SIDE
 AND ONE ON THE OTHER, TO SHOW
 THAT THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY
 SAYS IT'S HAPPENING.
 AND I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT AS
 YOU LOOK AT THE GOALS IN THE
 GREEN NEW DEAL AND NO ONE THINKS
 WE'RE GOING TO DOT EVERY "I" AND
 CROSS EVERY "T" IN A SHORT
 PERIOD OF TIME, BUT WE NEED
 THOSE GOALS.
 WE NEED THE ENERGY OF YOUNG
 PEOPLE AND PEOPLE THAT REALLY
 WANT TO MOVE ON CLIMATE CHANGE.
 SO THIS IS WHAT I SAY TO MY
 RURAL VOTERS.
 I SAY LOOK AT WHAT'S IN FRONT OF
 YOU.
 BECAUSE FOR TOO LONG WE'VE BEEN
 TALKING ABOUT IT ON MORE OF A
 COASTAL ISSUE, WHICH IS TRUE.
 RISING SEA LEVELS, THE GREENLAND
 SHEET ISSUE WAS IN THE NEWS
 TODAY, HURRICANES.
 BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT THE MIDDLE
 OF THE COUNTRY WHERE WE NEED TO
 POLITICAL SUPPORT.
 AND I PERSONALLY THINK SOMEONE
 FROM THE HEARTLAND COULD DO A
 GOOD JOB OF THAT.
 WHAT DO WE SEE IN FRONT OF US?
 FLOODS ALL OVER IOWA, NEBRASKA,
 AND MISSOURI.
 THIS IS IMPORTANT SO I'M GOING
 TO FINISH THIS.
 WE HAVE GOT -I FEEL YOU
 CREEPING OVER MY SHOULDER, NOT
 IN A TRUMPIAN MANNER.
 JUST LIKE YOU'RE THERE AND
 LIKE -THIS IS, LIKE, REALLY,
 REALLY IMPORTANT.
 SO THIS WOMAN IN IOWA, FRAN, SHE
 IS LITERALLY STANDING WITH ME
 WITH BINOCULARS ON LOOKING AT
 HER HOUSE WHICH IS SUBMERGED
 UNDER WATER AND SHE SAYS TO ME
 THIS IS WHERE I LIVE WITH MY
 HUSBAND AND MY TWO 4-YEAR-OLDS,
 AND I SAID IS THE RIVER RIGHT
 THERE?
 SHE SAYS, NO, THE RIVER IS 2 1/2
 MILES AWAY.
 OURS IS A HOUSE THAT'S OVER A
 CENTURY OLD.
 THERE'S STILL HORSEHAIR IN THE
 PLASTERS, BUT THIS TIME FOR THE
 FIRST TIME THE WATER CAME INTO
 MY HOUSE.
 THAT'S CLIMATE CHANGE.
 OR YOU LOOK AT THE WILDFIRES IN
 COLORADO OR ARIZONA OR YOU THINK
 THAT DAD IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA
 OUTSIDE OF PARADISE WHO'S
 DRIVING HIS LITTLE GIRL IN THE
 CAR WITH THEIR HOUSE PRESUMABLY
 BURNING BEHIND THEM, AND THE
 FLAMES ARE LAPPING OVER THEIR
 CAR AND HE'S SINGING TO HER,
 SINGING TO HER TO CALM HER DOWN.
 CLIMATE CHANGE ISN'T HAPPENING
 100 YEARS FROM NOW.
 IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW, AND
 THAT'S WHY AS YOUR PRESIDENT ON
 DAY ONE I WOULD GET US BACK INTO
 THE INTERNATIONAL CLIMATE CHANGE
 AGREEMENT.
 ALL RIGHT?
 THAT'S DAY ONE.
 ON DAY TWO AND DAY THREE I WOULD
 BRING BACK THE CLEAN POWER RULES
 THAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
 WORKED OUT THAT WILL MAKE A BIG
 DENT IN THIS.
 I WILL BRING BACK THE GAS MYELIN
 STANDARDS THAT THEY JUST LEFT
 AND SAID, OH, SORRY, I KNOW YOU
 CAR COMPANIES WERE READY TO DO
 IT, BUT GUESS WHAT, YOU DON'T
 HAVE TO.
 THAT'S WHAT THEY DID.
 AND I WOULD PROPOSE SWEEPING
 LEGISLATIONS FOR GREEN BUILDINGS
 AND NEW IDEAS AND WE NEED TO DO
 THIS.
 BECAUSE GUESS WHAT, IT'S YOU
 GUYS, NOT ME.
 IT'S MY DAUGHTER AND YOU GUYS
 THAT ARE GOING TO BE INHERITING
 THIS EARTH AND THAT'S WHY WE
 NEED YOU ON THE FRONT LINE, ALL
 RIGHT?
 OUR NEXT QUESTION IS ACTUALLY
 ONE I'VE NEVER HEARD BEFORE IN
 ONE OF THESE TOWN HALLS.
 OH, THAT REALLY BODES WELL
 FOR ME.
 I THINK I'LL SIT DOWN.
 IF IT WERE COMING FROM A
 REPORTER YOU GOT TO WORRY.
 A YOUNG MAN NAMED ZACK SMITH
 STUDYING POLITICS FROM
 MASSACHUSETTS.
 WHAT'S YOUR QUESTION?
 GOOD EVENING, SENATOR.
 MY QUESTION IS WHAT IS ONE ASAST
 PECT OF YOUR LIFE AS A
 POLITICIAN YOU WISH THE PUBLIC
 BETTER UNDERSTOOD?
 OKAY, THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
 SO MY LIFE AS A POLITICIAN.
 I THINK THAT I WISH PEOPLE
 BETTER UNDERSTOOD WHY I HAVE
 MADE SUCH A PRIORITY AND WHY I
 CARE SO MUCH ABOUT PEOPLE WHO
 GET IN TROUBLE WITH DRUGS AND
 PEOPLE WHO GET IN TROUBLE WITH
 DRINKING AND HOW I BELIEVE THAT
 THERE ARE GRAYS IN THIS WORLD
 AND THAT NOT EVERYTHING IS AN
 EXTREME, THAT PEOPLE CAN MESS UP
 AND GO ONTO DO GREAT THINGS AND
 THAT'S WHERE THAT BELIEF COMES
 FROM.
 SO IN MY CASE WHEN I WAS GROWING
 UP MY DAD HAD A BIG DRINKING
 PROBLEM.
 HE IS -I LOVE MY DAD SO MUCH.
 I JUST SAW HIM ABOUT A WEEK OR
 SO AGO.
 HE IS A DISTINGUISHED
 JOURNALIST.
 HE'S NOW RETIRED.
 HE IS 91 YEARS OLD.
 BUT AND IN HIS WORDS HE CAN'T
 GET A LOT OF DRINKS IN THE
 ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY.
 BUT THE POINT IS HIS AA GROUPS
 STILL VISIT HIM BECAUSE THAT'S
 HOW IN HIS OWN WORDS WAS
 PURSUED.
 PACK THEN 20 YEARS LATER THE
 LAWS HAD CHANGED AND FORCED HIM
 TO GO INTO TREATMENT, AND I WAS
 THERE WITH HIM WITH HIS
 MINISTER, AND WITH HIS LAWYER
 AND I TALKED ABOUT HOW IT HAD
 HURT MY LIFE AND MY SISTER'S
 LIFE, HOW WE WOULD WAIT FOR HIM
 TO COME HOME ALL THE TIME, HOW
 WE WOULD VANISH SOMETIMES AND BE
 GONE, AND WHAT IT MEANT TO BE
 GROWING UP WITH THAT.
 SO WHAT I SAW IN MY LIFE IS
 BECAUSE HE GOT TREATMENT AND
 BECAUSE ACTUALLY THE GOVERNMENT
 PUSHED HIM INTO TREATMENT IT
 CHANGED HIS LIFE.
 HE ENDED UP STAYING MARRIED FOR
 THE THIRD TIME, BUT HE DID.
 HE ENDED UP REALLY BEING ABLE TO
 SPEND TIME WITH ME AND MY SISTER
 LIKE HE HAD NEVER DONE BEFORE,
 AND I WANT OTHER PEOPLE TO HAVE
 THAT SAME RIGHT, WHETHER THEY
 GET HOOK ON OPIOIDS, YOU'VE GOT
 NEW HAMPSHIRE ONE OF THE BIGGEST
 OPIOID EPIDEMICS ACROSS IT
 COUNTRY.
 WHETHER IT MEANS THEY GOT HOOKED
 ON METH, NO MATTER WHAT IT IS
 THAT PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO
 HAVE THAT TREATMENT.
 AND IN THE CASE OF OPIOIDS, BY
 THE WAY, YOU KNOW WHO I'D HAVE
 PAY FOR THAT TREATMENT?
 THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES
 THAT GOT PEOPLE HOOKED ON THE
 DRUGS TO BEGIN WITH.
 SO IF YOU ASKED TO UNDERSTAND
 WHAT MOTIVATES ME SOMETIMES AND
 WHY I CAN BELIEVE IN TOUGH LOVE
 AND WHY I BELIEVE YOU HAVE TO
 SET EXPECTATIONS AND STANDARDS
 FOR YOURSELF AND THE PEOPLE
 AROUND YOU AND WHY I BELIEVE
 THAT EVERYONE HAS THAT SAME
 RIGHT TO HAVE THAT LIFE THAT MY
 DAD EVENTUALLY HAD IS BECAUSE OF
 MY OWN LIFE EXPERIENCE, AND I
 THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT AS YOU
 GUYS THINK ABOUT IF YOU WANT TO
 GO INTO PUBLIC SERVICE TO HAVE
 PEOPLE COME FROM ALL KINDS OF
 DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS.
 WE HAVE IN THE SENATE PEOPLE
 THAT GREW UP PRETTY RICH AND
 PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO'S GRANDPA HAD
 TO QUIT SCHOOL AND A DAD WHO
 STRUGGLED WITH ALCOHOLISM AND A
 MOM WHO WAS A TEACHER WHO TAUGHT
 SCHOOL UNTIL SHE WAS 70 YEARS
 OLD.
 SHE TAUGHT SECOND GRADE BECAUSE
 SHE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY
 BECAUSE MY PARENTS GOT DIVORCED.
 THAT'S MY LIFE.
 AND SOMEHOW I ENDED UP BEING
 ELECTED AS THE FIRST WOMAN
 SENATOR IN THE STATE OF
 MINNESOTA AND A C FOR
 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
 STATES OF AMERICA.
 OKAY, THAT IS WHAT THIS COUNTRY
 IS ABOUT, ALL RIGHT?
 LET'S TAKE A QUICK BREAK.
 WE'RE GOING TO BE BACK WITH MORE
 QUESTIONS FROM MINNESOTA SENATOR
 AMY KLOBUCHAR RIGHT AFTER THIS.
  She's staying in a rainforest  tree house? That's my dream.
   You dream big for a man on a   plane to Omaha.
 And she's zip lining with Little Jon?
              WHAT!
          It's Lil Jon.
       Even he knows that.
    Thanks, Captain Obvious.
      You're with Big Jon.
           I'm Steve.
   Don't hate-like their trip,
   book yours with Hotels.com
    and get rewarded basically    everywhere.
           Hotels.com.
            BE THERE.
            DO THAT.
          GET REWARDED.    PNC Bank has technology to    help make banking easier,
              like...
   a business borrowing solution
  to help get a little more space       with a lot less mom.
         or Home Insight,
     to search for a new house        within your budget.
     Because, they really need           their space.
     PNC — make today the day.

 WELCOME BACK TO CNN'S SPECIAL DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL
 TOWN HALL EVENT.
 FIRST UP TONIGHT IS SENATOR AMY
 KLOBUCHAR.
 WE'VE COVERED A WIDE RANGE OF
 ISSUES, NOT THIS ONE THAT WE'RE
 TAKING ON YET.
 IT IS A VETERAN SPECIFIC ISSUE
 AND A VERY IMPORTANT ONE.
 WE SHOULD BRING IN TIMOTHY
 BISHOP.
 A GRADUATE STUDENT AND FORMER
 ARMY OFFICER WHO SERVED FOR
 SEVEN YEARS INCLUDING TWO
 MISSIONS IN AFGHANISTAN.
 SO, FIRST, SAM, THANK YOU FOR
 YOUR SERVICE.
 WHAT'S YOUR QUESTION?
 SENATOR KLOBUCHAR, THANK YOU
 FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT.
 THANK YOU.
 AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE.
 NO WORRIES.
 I LOVE HOW YOU DOWN-PLAY IT,
 BUT IT'S NOT.
 DESPITE NEARLY 15 YEARS OF
 EFFORTS VETERANS STILL COMMIT
 SUICIDE ABOUT 1 1/2 TIMES THE
 RATE OF AVERAGE AMERICANS.
 THAT'S AFFECTED A LOT OF PEOPLE
 I'VE SERVED WITH.
 WHAT WOULD YOU DO AS PRESIDENT
 TO TRY TO STEM THIS EPIDEMIC?
 THANK YOU SO MUCH.
 AND TO PLEA THIS IS AN
 UNBELIEVABLE THING GOING ON.
 AND WE SAW IT COMING OUT OF THE
 IRAQ WAR, AFGHANISTAN, AND
 RECENTLY AS YOU KNOW THEY'VE
 EVEN COMMITTED SUICIDE AT
 VETERANS FACILITIES, IN THE
 PARKING LOT.
 SO WHAT I WOULD DO IS MAKE SURE
 WE HAVE THE RESOURCES TO HELP
 THEM WHEN IT COMES TO MENTAL
 HEALTH.
 BEING SICK PHYSICALLY SHOULD BE
 TREATED THE SAME AS BEING SICK
 MENTALLY, ALL RIGHT?
 AND THAT MEANS -THAT MEANS
 HAVING THE TYPE OF PSYCHIATRISTS
 AND PSYCHOLOGISTS AND COUNSELORS
 THAT WE NEED.
 THAT MEANS THINGS LIKE THE
 BROADER SUBJECT FOR ALL PEOPLE,
 IT IS THE MENTAL HEALTH PARODY
 BILL THAT MY FORMER SENATOR FROM
 MINNESOTA WHO WE SADLY LOST IN A
 PLANE CRASH WORKED SO HARD ON.
 AND THAT SIMPLY SAYS INSURANCE
 COMPANIES HAVE GOT TO HANDLE
 MENTAL HEALTH THINGS JUST LIKE
 THEY HANDLE PHYSICAL HEALTH
 THINGS.
 WHEN IT COMES TO THE VETERANS A
 LOT OF THEM AS YOU KNOW GO HOME
 TO SMALL TOWNS ACROSS AMERICA.
 SOMETIMES THEY DON'T HAVE THE
 KIND OF ACCESS ESPECIALLY IF
 THEY'RE IN THE RESERVE.
 SO THEY'RE ECONOMIC BACK
 SPORADICALLY TO OUR VA
 FACILITIES.
 SO WE HAVE TO DO A LOT BETTER
 JOB WHEN THEY'RE COMING BACK TO
 EVALUATE THEM, SEE WHAT THEY
 NEED,O TOUCH BASE WITH THEM.
 IF THEY DON'T HAVE A FACILITY
 NEAR THEM TO MAKE SURE THEY CAN
 SEE DOCTORS AND COUNSELORS TO
 HELP THEM.
 THIS IS A SCOURGE ON OUR
 COMMUNITIES BECAUSE WHEN THESE
 VETS SIGNED UP TO SERVE THERE
 WASN'T A WAITING LINE.
 AND THEY COME BACK TO AMERICA
 AND THEY NEED A JOB OR EDUCATION
 OR HEALTH CARE INCLUDING MENTAL
 HEALTH CARE, THERE SHOULD NEVER
 BE A WAITING LINE IN THE UNITED
 STATES OF AMERICA.
 NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM
 OLIVIA FERDINAND.
 SHE'S A SOPHOMORE FROM
 CONNECTICUT.
 HI, SENATOR.
 HI, OLIVIA.
 ONE OF YOUR MAIN POLICY
 PROPOSALS IS A $1 TRILLION
 INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE.
 INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT AS FLASHY
 AS OTHER POLICIES.
 I'LL TRY TO MAKE IT FLASHY.
 SEWER LINES?
 WATER SYSTEMS.
 IF YOU LIVE IN FLINT, IT'S A
 PRETTY IMPORTANT THING, BUT KEEP
 GOING.
 ALL RIGHT?
 DEFINITELY.
 SO HOW DO YOU MAKE
 INFRASTRUCTURE AN APPEALING
 ISSUE FOR YOUNG VOTERS?
 SURE.
 I WAS ACTUALLY RECENTLY IN
 NASHVILLE AND WE WERE TALKING
 ABOUT THIS AT FISK WITH SOME OF
 THE STUDENTS THERE, AND FOR A
 LOT OF STUDENTS AND YOUNG
 PEOPLE, THEY DON'T HAVE CARS,
 LIKE MY DAUGHTER.
 SO THEY CARE ABOUT TRANSIT
 WHETHER YOU'RE IN A BIG CITY OR
 A MEDIUM-SIZED CITY AND YOU WANT
 TO GET TO WHERE YOU ARE.
 MANCHESTER, ACTU THIS A
 HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST
 PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE IN THE
 COUNTRY, IF NOT THE HIGHEST,
 THAT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE ACCESS TO
 ANY KIND OF COMMUTER RAIL YET
 THEY NEED WORKERS TO COME UP TO
 WORK IN THEIR JOBS.
 SO I THINK YOU NEED TO TALK
 ABOUT NOT JUST ROADS AND
 BRIDGES, VERY IMPORTANT.
 I HAD THAT BRIDGE FALL DOWN JUST
 A MILE FROM MY HOUSE IN THE
 MIDDLE OF A SUMMER DAY.
 YES, THAT KIND OF INFRASTRUCTURE
 MATTERS, BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT
 TRANSIT, IT'S ALSO ABOUT
 CRUMBLING SCHOOLS LITERALLY IN
 BALTIMORE, THEY HAD SOME
 SCHOOLS, I SEE SOME HEADS
 NODDING, THAT DIDN'T HAVE HEAT
 THIS LAST YEAR.
 AND WE HAVE A PRESIDENT RIGHT
 NOW IN THE WHITE HOUSE THAT
 CLAIMED ON ELECTION NIGHT, OH, I
 REMEMBER THAT NIGHT, HE CLAIMED
 THAT HE WANTED TO DO SOMETHING
 ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE AND ALL
 HE'S DONE IS PUT A PACKAGE
 FORWARD THAT WAS ABOUT $200
 BILLION AND I SHOWED HOW WE CAN
 PAY FOR THIS, INCLUDING WITH THE
 INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING
 AUTHORITY, BONDS, OF COURSE
 DIRECT FEDERAL INVESTMENT BY
 REPEALING THOSE PORTIONS OF THE
 TAX CODE THAT BY THE WAY THE NEW
 REPUBLIC BILL, ANY OF
 YOU GUYS HAVE MOWN IN THE
 BAHAMAS?
 THEN YOU'RE OKAY.
 BECAUSE THEY GOT $150 BILLION
 OFF OF PEOPLE TO HELP WEALTHY
 PEOPLE JUST BY DOING THE CHANGES
 THEY MADE THERE.
 SO THERE'S A WAY TO PAY FOR THIS
 AND WE HAVE TO MOVE ON IT AND IT
 CAN'T JUST BE RHETORIC.
 YOU GUYS ONCE AGAIN WHEN IT
 COMES TO INFRASTRUCTURE, IF YOU
 DON'T HAVE SUBWAYS AT WORK OR
 BUSES THAT GET YOU TO PLACES
 WHERE YOU ARE AND YOU DON'T WANT
 TO GET A CAR OR YOU CAN'T AFFORD
 A CAR OR YOU HAVE A CAR AND YOU
 ONLY WANT TO BRING IT CERTAIN
 PLACES, INFRASTRUCTURE MATTERS
 TO YOU.
 DID I DO MY JOB?
 OKAY.
 GOOD.
 ALL RIGHT.
 THANKS.
 OKAY.
 HE TOLD ME ONCE WHEN I WAS ON
 HIS SHOW HE SAID GENERATIONS OF
 CUOMO HAVE LOST BY RUNNING ON
 INFRASTRUCTURE.
 THAT'S NOT REALLY TRUE.
 THEY WON AS GOVERNOR OF NEW
 YORK, BUT CONTINUE ON.
 BETTER THAN CREEPING AFTER
 YOU.
 SO FAR AWAY NOW.
 ALL RIGHT.
 OKAY.
 SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS AS A
 LARGER ISSUE.
 LET'S BRING IN SARAH TROPIANO.
 SHE'S A JUNIOR AT SAT. ANSELM
 COL
 COLLEGE.
 IMPORTANT CULTURAL QUESTION.
 WHAT DO YOU HAVE?
 HI, SENATOR.
 YOU ARE A KEY FIGURE IN THE
 JUDGE KAVANAUGH HEARING AND MANY
 FEMALE VOTERS FORMED A STRONG
 OPINION ON YOUR POLITICS.
 IF YOU HAD ONE THING TO SAY TO
 YOUNG FEMALE VOTERS OR COLLEGE
 STUDENTS, WHAT WOULD IT BE AND
 WHY?
 WELL, I WOULD SAY THAT PLEASE
 RUN FOR OFFICE.
 RIGHT NOW I THINK WE HAVE
 SOMETHING LIKE -WE'RE NOW UP
 TO OVER 25 WOMEN IN THE SENATE.
 THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE IN THE
 HISTORY OF THE SENATE WE'VE HAD
 OVER 2,000 MEN AND SOMETHING
 LIKE 50 WOMEN.
 I WAS ON TREVOR NOAH'S SHOW HE
 SAID IF A NIGHTCLUB HAD A RATIO
 LIKE THAT THEY WOULD SHUT IT
 DOWN, OKAY?
 SO I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU RUN
 FOR OFFICE.
 THAT YOU GET INVOLVED IN
 CAMPAIGNS.
 BY THE WAY, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO
 BE A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN,
 ALTHOUGH I'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU
 SIGN UP FOR MINE AND YOU CAN
 TEXT AMY AT 91990 OR YOU CAN GO
 TO OUR WEB
 WEBSITE @AMYKLOBUCHAR.COM.
 I DID THAT, TEAM, THANK YOU.
 SO WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOU
 INVOLVED IN OUR CAMPAIGN AND I'M
 SURE MY FRIENDS WHO ARE RUNNING
 AS WELL WOULD LIKE THAT.
 BUT YOU'VE GOT TO RUN YOURSELF.
 YOU CAN GET INVOLVED IN
 NONPROFITS.
 ONE OF THE THINGS WE LEARNED
 FROM THE KAVANAUGH HEARING, WE
 HAVE ADDED SOME GREAT WOMEN TO
 THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.
 BUT FOR SO LONG, UNTIL ABOUT TWO
 YEARS AGO, IT WAS JUST TWO OF
 US.
 TWO WOMEN AND LIKE 22 MEN.
 THOSE ARE THE RATIOS THAT WE'RE
 TALKING ABOUT.
 AND THAT MOMENT, BY THE WAY, WAS
 ANOTHER MOMENT FOR ME WHERE I
 WAS JUST TRYING TO DO MY JOB AND
 ASK HIM QUESTIONS AND YOU KNOW
 THAT WAS AN ISSUE OF DR.
 CHRISTINE BLASS SEE FORD AND HER
 COURAGEOUS TESTIMONY.
 WHEN I WAS TRYING TO SINK UP
 WHAT HE SAID AND WHAT SHE SAID,
 IF YOU REMEMBER HE WENT AFTER
 ME, HE SAID, HAVE YOU EVER
 BLACKED OUT?
 I SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT, I WANT
 YOU TO ANSWER THE QUESTION.
 I WANT YOU TO ANSWER THE
 QUESTION.
 WHEN YOU HAVE ALCOHOLISM IN YOUR
 FAMILY, YOU DON'T MESS AROUND
 WITH STUFF LIKE THAT.
 AND HE ENDED UP COMING BACK AND
 APOLOGIZING TO ME, BUT I THINK
 YOU SAW AT THAT MOMENT IF ANY OF
 YOU WATCHED THAT THAT YOU CAN BE
 STRONG AND FIRM BUT YOU DON'T
 HAVE TO GO DOWN AND ACT LIKE HE
 DID TO BE IN PUBLIC SERVICE IN
 THIS COUNTRY.
 QUICKLY BEFORE WE SAY
 GOOD-BYE.
 ON THAT NOTE, WHAT IS ONE THING
 THAT YOU HOPE YOUR DAUGHTER HAS
 IN HER LIFETIME THAT YOU DIDN'T
 HAVE IN YOURS?
 OH, WELL I HOPE THAT SHE CAN
 GO THROUGH HER LIFE WITHOUT
 PEOPLE ASKING YOU THINGS LIKE
 CAN A WOMAN ACTUALLY BEAT DONALD
 TRUMP?
 ANSWER, YES.
 I HOPE THAT SHE CAN GO THROUGH
 HER LIFE, AN ISSUE WE HAVEN'T
 TALKED ABOUT, WITHOUT HAVING
 THAT FEAR OF GUNS IN THE HANDS
 OF PEOPLE THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE
 THEM AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT
 I PLEDGE TO YOU AS YOUR
 PRESIDENT, AND THIS IS SOMETHING
 THAT SHOULD MATTER TO YOUR
 GENERATION, I WILL TAKE ON IN A
 BIG WAY.
 IT IS A CRIME THAT WE DON'T HAVE
 UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS AND
 THAT WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING TO
 FURTHER THAT ISSUE.
 AND I'LL END WITH THIS BECAUSE
 YOU GUYS, THIS IS YOUR MOMENT.
 WHEN I LOOK AT THE ARC OF THE
 LAST YEAR AND WHAT WE'VE BEEN
 THROUGH THE LAST TWO YEARS, YOU
 START THE DAY AFTER DONALD TRUMP
 GOT SWORN IN WHERE WOMEN AND MEN
 PEACEFULLY MARCHED ALL OVER THIS
 COUNTRY.
 YOU GO TO DAY TEN WHEN HE PUT
 OUT THAT HORRIBLE ANTI-MUSLIM
 ORDER.
 THE ANTI-REFUGEE ORDER WHERE
 PEOPLE SPONTANEOUSLY SHOWED UP
 AT THE AIRPORTS INCLUDING A
 BUNCH OF YOUNG PEOPLE.
 DAY 100, MY FAVORITE MARCH, THE
 MARCH FOR SCIENCE.
 WHAT DO WE WANT, SCIENCE?
 WHEN DO WE WANT IT?
 AFTER PEER REVIEW.
 YOU GO THROUGH THE FALL ON THIS
 INCREDIBLE VICTORY FOR DIGNITY
 AND RACISM.
 DOUG JONES GOT ELECTED IN THE
 STATE OF ALABAMA AND THEN YOU GO
 TO DAY 429 WHEN THOSE PARKLAND
 YOU STUDENTS CAPTURED THE
 ATTENTION OF THE WORLD.
 THEY SPOKE OUT.
 THAT IS YOUR GENERATION AND THEN
 WE TOOK OVER THE HOUSE OF
 REPRESENTATIVES.
 WHY?
 BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T JUST TALK TO
 EACH OTHER, YOU VOTED AND YOU
 DIDN'T JUST VOTE, YOU TALKED TO
 YOUR PARENTS AND YOUR
 GRANDPARENTS.
 I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THAT ISSUE
 A LONG TIME.
 THE MOMS IN SANDY HOOK TRIED
 THEIR BEST AND COULDN'T GET IT
 DONE.
 WHEN I WAS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT WE
 TRIED TO GET IT DONE AND IF WE
 GET BESTED BY A BUNCH OF 19 AND
 20-YEAR-OLDS, THAT'S THE BEST
 THING I EVER HEARD.
 SO VOTE AND GET INVOLVED.
 SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR.
 GOOD LUCK GOING FORWARD.
 ALL RIGHT.
 NEXT UP, SENATOR ELIZABETH
 WARREN.
 STAY WITH CNN.
            I switched to MiraLAX             for my constipation.
             <i> Stimulant laxatives</i>            <i> forcefully stimulate</i>
       <i> the nerves in your colon.</i>
